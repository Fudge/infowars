[00:00.000 --> 00:15.480]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:15.480 --> 00:37.280]  Are you on the side of truth, and justice, and logic, and reasoning, and reality?
[00:37.280 --> 00:45.000]  Or do you buy into the leftist mainstream media establishment thought paradigm, which
[00:45.000 --> 00:56.000]  is anti-logic, anti-reality, fully emotional driven by propaganda, and self-destructive
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.760]  by its very design?
[00:58.760 --> 01:01.960]  We're going to be hearing from Alex Jones coming up shortly, Owen Schreuer here in
[01:01.960 --> 01:05.800]  studio filling in for Alex today.
[01:05.800 --> 01:09.240]  What is the biggest story?
[01:09.240 --> 01:16.680]  To my left, I have a stack of news indicating how the left has activated its race riots,
[01:16.680 --> 01:20.600]  and are getting ready to do this again.
[01:20.600 --> 01:26.920]  When I cover that news, I will expose the total fraud that is Black Lives Matter, and
[01:26.920 --> 01:30.520]  this notion somehow that America or police are racist.
[01:30.520 --> 01:34.120]  No, it's all based on media propaganda.
[01:34.120 --> 01:35.280]  Is that the biggest story?
[01:35.280 --> 01:45.360]  Is it the Supreme Court, with Neil Gorsuch, ruling that sanctuary cities are legal, or
[01:45.360 --> 01:57.520]  ruling that LGBTQI, PA, 69, or 49, hud hud hike, PQA discrimination is illegal in the
[01:57.520 --> 01:58.520]  workforce?
[01:58.520 --> 02:00.960]  Why are we even talking about that on Supreme Court?
[02:00.960 --> 02:05.400]  Is Supreme Court supposed to be one of the highest level, intellect, logic, philosophy,
[02:05.400 --> 02:11.440]  reasoning groups of people on planet Earth, and we have them talking about PPs and Weewees?
[02:11.440 --> 02:15.600]  Wow, it's the clown world.
[02:15.600 --> 02:17.200]  Is that the big news?
[02:17.200 --> 02:23.000]  Or is it the fake pandemic that they faked, and that they're now trying to run a Statue
[02:23.000 --> 02:30.160]  of Liberty handoff and fake again?
[02:30.160 --> 02:37.280]  Is it the fact that Google, which I will expose today, which I've exposed in the past, is
[02:37.280 --> 02:41.400]  rewriting our history?
[02:41.400 --> 02:46.160]  Think about the inclination there.
[02:46.160 --> 02:52.360]  An entire generation of people who will grow up assuming Google is giving them the facts,
[02:52.360 --> 02:58.120]  giving them the history, and it turns out in live time right now, Google is rewriting
[02:58.120 --> 03:05.720]  American history, and specifically for our coverage today, erasing the fact that the
[03:05.720 --> 03:12.480]  Democrats and the KKK were the party of slavery, erasing the fact that it was all Democrats
[03:12.480 --> 03:21.200]  that were filibustering the Civil Rights Act, and now even labeling them Republicans on
[03:21.200 --> 03:27.360]  Google, I'm not kidding you, some of the biggest Dixie-Krat and Democrats from the Civil Rights
[03:27.360 --> 03:32.880]  era that fought the Civil Rights, Google now labels as Republicans, you cannot make this
[03:32.880 --> 03:33.880]  up.
[03:33.880 --> 03:36.960]  It's kind of like, you know, you search racist and Google and Twitter and they have it programmed
[03:36.960 --> 03:41.840]  in their algorithm to pop up Donald Trump.
[03:41.840 --> 03:46.560]  These are enemy operations against America, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:46.560 --> 03:52.040]  By the way, China has declared wartime operations.
[03:52.040 --> 03:54.520]  We'll get into that.
[03:54.520 --> 04:03.760]  But I think it can all be summarized in two stories or images.
[04:03.760 --> 04:09.280]  This was pointed out by Mark Hemingway on Twitter, maybe others perhaps, and these two
[04:09.280 --> 04:15.280]  stories went out just an hour apart from one another from the same source, NBC News.
[04:15.280 --> 04:20.920]  First one comes out, Rally for Black Trans Lives draws packed crowd to Brooklyn Museum
[04:20.920 --> 04:21.920]  Plaza.
[04:21.920 --> 04:25.600]  I think this footage probably tends, looks like a ton of people, maybe 10,000 people
[04:25.600 --> 04:28.640]  out there in Brooklyn, because I'm sure they all care about trans lives.
[04:28.640 --> 04:33.320]  No, they just hate Trump, just the latest facade to march for it.
[04:33.320 --> 04:39.040]  But then an hour later, same source says, President Trump plans to rally his supporters
[04:39.040 --> 04:44.440]  next Saturday for the first time since most of the country was shuttered by the coronavirus.
[04:44.440 --> 04:48.040]  Health experts are questioning that decision.
[04:48.040 --> 04:50.280]  Liberal privilege.
[04:50.280 --> 04:54.120]  They get to riot and protest and loot and do all their marches.
[04:54.120 --> 04:56.280]  You can't have a rally, a funeral, nothing.
[04:56.280 --> 04:59.080]  You're a bad American.
[04:59.080 --> 05:03.680]  It's finally here, introducing the first of its kind, nascent iodine spray with true
[05:03.680 --> 05:05.160]  atomic iodine.
[05:05.160 --> 05:09.400]  Listers have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive
[05:09.400 --> 05:11.640]  deep earth crystal nascent iodine.
[05:11.640 --> 05:13.600]  After extensive development, it's finally here.
[05:13.600 --> 05:18.240]  Our proprietary new aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine
[05:18.240 --> 05:22.520]  crystals from 7,000 feet below the earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula.
[05:22.520 --> 05:26.680]  I have been using the new X2 spray every day, and I feel good knowing that I have the power
[05:26.680 --> 05:29.040]  of true nascent iodine working for my body.
[05:29.040 --> 05:30.720]  I can personally feel the difference.
[05:30.720 --> 05:35.080]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health, as well as healthy
[05:35.080 --> 05:39.160]  metabolism, healthy hormone levels, and healthy cognitive function.
[05:39.160 --> 05:43.720]  Iodine may also support your body in healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.
[05:43.720 --> 05:48.080]  Get your daily dose of essential iodine and experience the benefits of true nascent iodine
[05:48.080 --> 05:49.080]  today.
[05:49.080 --> 05:54.240]  Get the new Survival Shield X2 spray for 33% off at InfoWarStore.com before we sell
[05:54.240 --> 06:10.800]  out of our new limited first shipment, that's InfoWarStore.com.
[06:10.800 --> 06:15.160]  We have the documents, we have the research, we have the proof, we have the enemy's battle
[06:15.160 --> 06:16.160]  plan.
[06:16.160 --> 06:22.840]  Alex Jones here, thank you for joining us on this live Monday global transmission with
[06:22.840 --> 06:23.840]  Owen Stroller.
[06:23.840 --> 06:30.960]  I will be back later with a key report in the third hour on the United Nations global
[06:30.960 --> 06:37.400]  government plan to bring down the U.S. economy and then shut down the police forces systematically
[06:37.400 --> 06:40.560]  and then have the forces turned over to United Nations control.
[06:40.560 --> 06:41.880]  This is official.
[06:41.880 --> 06:46.720]  There are hours and hours and hours of this at the U.N. building in New York from 2015
[06:46.720 --> 06:51.280]  within Attorney General Loretta Lynch laying out the battle plan.
[06:51.280 --> 06:52.280]  This is all very serious.
[06:52.280 --> 06:57.280]  That's why I keep telling conservatives that make jokes about the idiot leftist and Antifa.
[06:57.280 --> 07:00.440]  That is only their ground force decoy.
[07:00.440 --> 07:04.800]  This is systematic and international and deadly dangerous.
[07:04.800 --> 07:07.800]  Now police everywhere resigning should not be doing that.
[07:07.800 --> 07:10.000]  You signed up for this job supposedly to protect people.
[07:10.000 --> 07:11.840]  Now you protect America.
[07:11.840 --> 07:16.720]  If you stand down, they are ready to bring in their people and accelerate the accreditation
[07:16.720 --> 07:22.240]  and put actual Antifa-type scum in uniform and then the real civil war starts.
[07:22.240 --> 07:24.720]  So no one needs to be resigning right now.
[07:24.720 --> 07:28.760]  You need to be out there doing your job and understanding this is political.
[07:28.760 --> 07:34.320]  This is a setup and this is fourth and fifth generation warfare against the United States
[07:34.320 --> 07:38.960]  of America and they're launching the same programs worldwide.
[07:38.960 --> 07:42.800]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, I'll be laying this out later.
[07:42.800 --> 07:45.640]  John Downs put on an excellent report detailing it as well.
[07:45.640 --> 07:53.880]  If we're going to be hearing that, this is a imperative issue that people take this extremely
[07:53.880 --> 07:54.880]  seriously.
[07:54.880 --> 07:55.880]  It's not a game.
[07:55.880 --> 07:57.280]  It's not a joke.
[07:57.280 --> 08:00.000]  Everybody like to laugh at me in the last 20-something years.
[08:00.000 --> 08:01.800]  Well, you're not laughing now.
[08:01.800 --> 08:03.880]  And it's not about how I was right.
[08:03.880 --> 08:06.040]  It's about there's no more time to screw around.
[08:06.040 --> 08:08.800]  There's no more time to play games.
[08:08.800 --> 08:10.280]  We're under attack.
[08:10.280 --> 08:11.840]  It's a world government.
[08:11.840 --> 08:13.360]  It's systematic.
[08:13.360 --> 08:14.360]  It's evil.
[08:14.360 --> 08:15.560]  All this has been war-gamed.
[08:15.560 --> 08:17.240]  Every single angle of it.
[08:17.240 --> 08:23.920]  All of it integrates in the COVID-19 hoax, all the race riots, it is designed to paralyze
[08:23.920 --> 08:24.920]  the nation.
[08:24.920 --> 08:31.600]  So instead of being paralyzed, we all go into political and cultural action against this.
[08:31.600 --> 08:33.720]  This is 21st century warfare.
[08:33.720 --> 08:39.440]  We're facing it, identify it, adapt and overcome it, or become slaves.
[08:39.440 --> 08:42.720]  The path of laying down and being passive is over.
[08:42.720 --> 08:48.320]  The only path to any future is waking up, getting real, spreading the word, and radicalizing
[08:48.320 --> 08:51.200]  your fellow Americans against the globalist.
[08:51.200 --> 08:52.480]  We have to radicalize now.
[08:52.480 --> 08:53.600]  We have to get aggressive now.
[08:53.600 --> 08:54.880]  We have to get very serious now.
[08:54.880 --> 08:56.240]  We're going to lose everything.
[08:56.240 --> 09:00.120]  Undress being the enemy attack will be our downfall.
[09:00.120 --> 09:02.040]  Recognizing it will be victory.
[09:02.040 --> 09:11.480]  God bless the baccalaureate transmission.
[09:11.480 --> 09:16.880]  Awarded babies incinerated to eat in UK hospitals.
[09:16.880 --> 09:20.800]  Silent green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people.
[09:20.800 --> 09:26.560]  But now children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals
[09:26.560 --> 09:27.560]  in the UK.
[09:27.560 --> 09:32.200]  They are sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[09:32.200 --> 09:37.000]  What is the secret of Silent Green?
[09:37.000 --> 09:39.600]  The powdered flesh from dead babies.
[09:39.600 --> 09:42.400]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[09:42.400 --> 09:47.040]  Because of its enormous popularity, Silent Green is in short supply.
[09:47.040 --> 09:50.040]  Remember, Tuesday is Silent Green Day.
[09:50.040 --> 09:53.040]  The supply of Silent Green has been exhausted.
[09:53.040 --> 09:56.040]  You must evacuate the area.
[09:56.040 --> 09:58.920]  Is that the code rule?
[09:58.920 --> 10:06.520]  That the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Builder Bird Group Company, are not allowed to know
[10:06.520 --> 10:10.400]  what they're using the baby parts for and the flavoring, but we already know.
[10:10.400 --> 10:12.400]  So enjoy the flavor.
[10:12.400 --> 10:15.560]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death panels
[10:15.560 --> 10:16.840]  and sales taxes.
[10:16.840 --> 10:18.800]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[10:18.800 --> 10:20.720]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[10:20.720 --> 10:22.000]  I'm for regular suicide.
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.400]  Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would
[10:28.400 --> 10:35.440]  it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade up in medical costs?
[10:35.440 --> 10:39.760]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[10:39.760 --> 10:54.280]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[10:54.280 --> 10:56.920]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[10:56.920 --> 11:01.760]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[11:01.760 --> 11:04.360]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[11:04.360 --> 11:09.320]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison
[11:09.320 --> 11:13.680]  guards, on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[11:13.680 --> 11:16.800]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[11:16.800 --> 11:23.440]  The scoops are on their way, the scoops are on their way, I repeat, the scoops are on
[11:23.440 --> 11:24.440]  their way.
[11:24.440 --> 11:30.240]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life, you will find out why Soylent Green
[11:30.240 --> 11:31.240]  means death.
[11:31.240 --> 11:55.720]  The report you just saw was followed more than six years ago by myself and David Knight.
[11:55.720 --> 11:58.120]  You heard what David Knight said there.
[11:58.120 --> 12:04.160]  He said a society like that will turn on its citizens, on its police and on other quizlings
[12:04.160 --> 12:06.080]  that didn't understand what was happening.
[12:06.080 --> 12:08.560]  We know the enemy battle plan.
[12:08.560 --> 12:13.960]  We have the blueprints, but you're going to have to admit that it is an illegal outside
[12:13.960 --> 12:16.800]  globalist move and we're all in great danger.
[12:16.800 --> 12:21.560]  If you will not assess the real threat and the systematic nature of this and how these
[12:21.560 --> 12:26.600]  different operations overlay and how the globalists admit all of it, then there's no way to counter
[12:26.600 --> 12:27.600]  it.
[12:27.600 --> 12:31.960]  If you go after each one of the attacks as a separate operation, it doesn't work.
[12:31.960 --> 12:39.360]  Only full overview of this and then focusing on each little subsection can turn this around.
[12:39.360 --> 12:41.160]  I've been studying this for 30 years.
[12:41.160 --> 12:43.080]  I've interviewed all the top experts.
[12:43.080 --> 12:44.880]  We know what's going on.
[12:44.880 --> 12:46.680]  So again, I'm getting chills right now.
[12:46.680 --> 12:51.720]  Well, we all sit here and fiddle, America burns, but it's the realization of the enemy
[12:51.720 --> 12:54.680]  operation that sets us free.
[12:54.680 --> 12:57.680]  We're back now live in the studio.
[12:57.680 --> 12:59.200]  I want to show you with you.
[12:59.200 --> 13:03.560]  We'll be hearing from Alex Jones again before this transmission concludes.
[13:03.560 --> 13:12.040]  We are going to be joined by our crew live from the Autonomous Nation of Chas, which
[13:12.040 --> 13:16.320]  actually if these people understood law, they'd understood if they really just were serious
[13:16.320 --> 13:22.080]  about that, the military could just go in and wipe them all out clean to reclaim American
[13:22.080 --> 13:23.080]  territory.
[13:23.080 --> 13:27.400]  And yeah, that evil dictator Trump hasn't made that proclamation.
[13:27.400 --> 13:31.520]  So I guess they're lucky again, but we'll be joined by our crew on the ground.
[13:31.520 --> 13:39.440]  We've also got Gerald Salenty coming up in the fourth hour, always informative and entertaining.
[13:39.440 --> 13:46.400]  Before I get to this news and all these powerful videos, I realized something hearing that
[13:46.400 --> 13:54.080]  report from Alex and David Knight, because I think that we're all at a bit of a crossroads
[13:54.080 --> 14:04.120]  internally, realizing where this path leads us, realizing what the future holds.
[14:04.120 --> 14:12.080]  And our angst is in the fact that we all know if we don't act now, when we do have to act,
[14:12.080 --> 14:21.760]  it's going to be out of straight up instinctual self-defense, I mean, at your door style.
[14:21.760 --> 14:25.440]  It's like, we could clear all this up now.
[14:25.440 --> 14:26.440]  We know the names.
[14:26.440 --> 14:34.920]  We know the players, but they continue to operate.
[14:34.920 --> 14:37.160]  And so they've got their brainwashed hordes.
[14:37.160 --> 14:39.200]  They've got their media.
[14:39.200 --> 14:44.840]  They've got everything activated against America right now.
[14:44.840 --> 14:51.720]  And I think for us, the most banned news network out there, because we're pro-America, because
[14:51.720 --> 14:56.400]  we're pro-human, because we're pro-freedom, because we're pro-truth, because we're not
[14:56.400 --> 15:02.760]  bought and paid for, what is our mission now?
[15:02.760 --> 15:10.880]  If we had to have a mission-orient as a team, what was it?
[15:10.880 --> 15:11.880]  What is it now?
[15:11.880 --> 15:16.120]  Well, if it was getting Trump in office and getting people to understand the political
[15:16.120 --> 15:22.760]  revolution and getting people to see the sides of the coin and the 21 side to die and all
[15:22.760 --> 15:26.600]  this stuff, well, we've already done that, folks.
[15:26.600 --> 15:27.640]  We've already exposed it all.
[15:27.640 --> 15:30.760]  The deep state, Epstein, I mean, you name it all.
[15:30.760 --> 15:33.320]  The police stayed all of it.
[15:33.320 --> 15:34.840]  So what is our mission-orient now?
[15:34.840 --> 15:35.840]  It's weird.
[15:35.840 --> 15:38.440]  It's like, we've completed our mission-orient, and now we're kind of fumbling around like
[15:38.440 --> 15:41.720]  wondering, what is our new mission-orient?
[15:41.720 --> 15:43.840]  But I realize it now.
[15:43.840 --> 15:44.840]  Just listen to that report.
[15:44.840 --> 15:48.200]  Our mission-orient is now that we're here.
[15:48.200 --> 15:52.360]  Now that we're here, it's to tell people, OK, folks, we're here now, it's time to get
[15:52.360 --> 15:57.640]  battle-hardened, and it's time to get ready, because we know what comes next.
[15:57.640 --> 16:00.160]  I'm always excited about M4's live products.
[16:00.160 --> 16:01.160]  They're amazing.
[16:01.160 --> 16:02.160]  They're cutting-edge.
[16:02.160 --> 16:03.160]  You love them.
[16:03.160 --> 16:06.240]  I love them, and they find the info war in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[16:06.240 --> 16:12.800]  But we have come up with a new product, over a year in development, that is amazing.
[16:12.800 --> 16:20.560]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it,
[16:20.560 --> 16:24.880]  and there's another innovation, it's the spray cap.
[16:24.880 --> 16:31.080]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, goo, but it's high-quality and aerosolizes
[16:31.080 --> 16:32.440]  it in a really great way.
[16:32.440 --> 16:35.680]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face.
[16:35.680 --> 16:40.520]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it around your eyes, but I just love it personally
[16:40.520 --> 16:42.880]  as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[16:42.880 --> 16:44.640]  So this is a real innovation.
[16:44.640 --> 16:48.680]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has
[16:48.680 --> 16:52.560]  essential oil in it, so it doesn't dry you out, smells great.
[16:52.560 --> 16:54.440]  It's so refreshing.
[16:54.440 --> 16:58.240]  This is a big winner.
[16:58.240 --> 17:06.800]  It's finally here, introducing the new survival shield X2 spray, available now for 33% off

[19:19.120 --> 19:24.360]  I know that there's going to be some stuff happening today that I think they're tracking.
[19:24.360 --> 19:29.800]  And so we're going to go to Sam now in the autonomous nation of Chazz.
[19:29.800 --> 19:36.600]  One nation under Chazz Pledge of Allegiance by the Chazz of Stonians for Chazz by Chazz
[19:36.600 --> 19:39.880]  in Chazz eternal Chazz.
[19:39.880 --> 19:42.800]  And so now Sam joins us from the Chazz eternal.
[19:42.800 --> 19:43.800]  All right.
[19:43.800 --> 19:50.840]  So you're now what night three in the autonomous zone, the autonomous Woodstock of Chazz.
[19:50.840 --> 19:52.240]  So what is the latest?
[19:52.240 --> 19:54.600]  How are things going?
[19:54.600 --> 19:59.280]  Well, the latest Owen, yes, coming to you live from Chazz here, the great nation of
[19:59.280 --> 20:00.280]  Chazz.
[20:00.280 --> 20:02.640]  Oh, actually, we have some news breaking news.
[20:02.640 --> 20:05.040]  It's now the nation of chop chop.
[20:05.040 --> 20:06.040]  You know what?
[20:06.040 --> 20:07.960]  I forgot that they changed it to chop.
[20:07.960 --> 20:11.040]  And now they're even saying they want to chop anyone's heads off.
[20:11.040 --> 20:12.040]  That's a dissident.
[20:12.040 --> 20:16.640]  Oh, that might be there's definitely a little bit of that kind of sentiment going around
[20:16.640 --> 20:17.640]  here.
[20:17.640 --> 20:21.520]  Actually, I was going to let you know, I feel a little bad because I packed extra clothes
[20:21.520 --> 20:24.640]  when I could have just been getting free clothes from chop the whole time.
[20:24.640 --> 20:25.640]  They have free clothes.
[20:25.640 --> 20:26.640]  They have free groceries.
[20:26.640 --> 20:27.640]  Oh, is that tailored?
[20:27.640 --> 20:28.640]  I bought my wallet.
[20:28.640 --> 20:29.640]  Oh, oh, they'll get you.
[20:29.640 --> 20:34.320]  They have some scissors, free scissors, they'll get you right there in the booth.
[20:34.320 --> 20:35.320]  So.
[20:35.320 --> 20:36.320]  So but really, where are they getting?
[20:36.320 --> 20:37.680]  Who's paying for clothes and stuff?
[20:37.680 --> 20:38.920]  Where are they getting these clothes?
[20:38.920 --> 20:40.800]  That's a good question.
[20:40.800 --> 20:44.720]  You know, as far as like people who might be helping them out, we have seen some you
[20:44.720 --> 20:46.640]  haul truck that we're able to get through.
[20:46.640 --> 20:49.920]  So it's not like hand me down to like brand new clothing coming in.
[20:49.920 --> 20:52.360]  I'm not quite sure about that.
[20:52.360 --> 20:56.960]  It might be a little bit of both, actually, because we even saw, you know, some businesses
[20:56.960 --> 21:02.160]  helping out and providing like food and now we have seen them gardening.
[21:02.160 --> 21:07.200]  How is the cardboard soil with the brawn dough going for the gardeners there?
[21:07.200 --> 21:10.840]  The farmers of Chas must be going pretty successful.
[21:10.840 --> 21:15.520]  I saw they had some fresh vegetables yesterday for everyone to knock on.
[21:15.520 --> 21:20.840]  So I don't know if it tastes a little bit like cardboard, but so is this just how it's
[21:20.840 --> 21:21.840]  going to be then?
[21:21.840 --> 21:25.680]  I mean, is there any sign of any law enforcement or anything ever coming back?
[21:25.680 --> 21:26.680]  Is this just?
[21:26.680 --> 21:27.680]  Is this just it?
[21:27.680 --> 21:30.640]  Is Chas just eternal now?
[21:30.640 --> 21:31.640]  It's looking that way.
[21:31.640 --> 21:35.200]  I mean, the only thing that's stopping everybody from being out partying right now is a little
[21:35.200 --> 21:36.200]  bit of rain.
[21:36.200 --> 21:42.680]  So we'll see what happens, but I don't see any sign of law enforcement or the fire department
[21:42.680 --> 21:48.680]  trying to make any changes as far as how Chas is the nation of Chas is set up.
[21:48.680 --> 21:49.680]  How many chop?
[21:49.680 --> 21:50.680]  How many?
[21:50.680 --> 21:55.760]  How many people in chop are actually from chop?
[21:55.760 --> 21:56.760]  That's a good question.
[21:56.760 --> 21:57.920]  Actually, me and Rob, we're thinking the same thing.
[21:57.920 --> 22:04.160]  It looks like there's a lot of people who are not from here that just came down to maybe
[22:04.160 --> 22:07.920]  use this as an opportunity to get out of the house, just be around people and not have
[22:07.920 --> 22:09.520]  to socially distance.
[22:09.520 --> 22:12.920]  So there's a lot of tourism in chop right now.
[22:12.920 --> 22:13.920]  Let's put it that way.
[22:13.920 --> 22:19.200]  Now, Fauci and Berks, they came to chop to do a COVID announcement, right?
[22:19.200 --> 22:21.040]  To tell people to social distance and everything.
[22:21.040 --> 22:22.520]  Did you guys, did that happen?
[22:22.520 --> 22:23.520]  Did they make it to chop?
[22:23.520 --> 22:24.520]  I didn't.
[22:24.520 --> 22:26.520]  No, actually, I missed that.
[22:26.520 --> 22:27.720]  I don't know if they made it to chop.
[22:27.720 --> 22:31.040]  I haven't seen any government officials come down and chop.
[22:31.040 --> 22:34.480]  Bill Gates, I mean, Bill Gates with his private island, his home that's worth hundreds of
[22:34.480 --> 22:35.480]  millions of dollars.
[22:35.480 --> 22:40.200]  Is chop ever thinking about migrating that way?
[22:40.200 --> 22:41.440]  I mean, it might be.
[22:41.440 --> 22:43.560]  This idea is spreading like fire around here.
[22:43.560 --> 22:44.560]  So you never know.
[22:44.560 --> 22:49.680]  They might end up getting an island of their own and having to chop island and a little
[22:49.680 --> 22:51.280]  place to take a vacation.
[22:51.280 --> 22:56.880]  When you're done having a chop over here, you can go chop on an island with some elite.
[22:56.880 --> 23:00.600]  By the way, they literally said, where is it here?
[23:00.600 --> 23:01.600]  Oh, yeah.
[23:01.600 --> 23:03.800]  Those, the stories at infowars.com.
[23:03.800 --> 23:09.280]  Protesters not on board with French Revolution were chopped, jazz protesters worn after renaming
[23:09.280 --> 23:11.680]  their camp to chop.
[23:11.680 --> 23:13.640]  So it's now the Capitol Hill chop.
[23:13.640 --> 23:17.360]  This isn't like the chop shop, like the motorcycle place or like the meat house or something.
[23:17.360 --> 23:19.520]  This is like they want to chop your head off.
[23:19.520 --> 23:21.520]  But you know, I saw a bunch of anti-trunk protests.
[23:21.520 --> 23:23.920]  So, so really, and I want you to go link up.
[23:23.920 --> 23:26.440]  I know there's about to be an interesting situation there.
[23:26.440 --> 23:29.480]  We'll kind of leave it as a deep radio tease that you're going to be involved in.
[23:29.480 --> 23:31.760]  We'll have hopefully some live footage of that.
[23:31.760 --> 23:34.200]  But I mean, seriously, what is the overall mentality today?
[23:34.200 --> 23:36.800]  I mean, is it kind of burning out?
[23:36.800 --> 23:39.560]  Is it kind of like, okay, we need to start behaving like adults?
[23:39.560 --> 23:41.640]  Is it like, oh crap, we just turned this into a hellhole?
[23:41.640 --> 23:45.600]  I mean, what is just kind of the overall mentality right now?
[23:45.600 --> 23:50.920]  Well, to be honest, I think the business owners might be even getting a little tired of having
[23:50.920 --> 23:55.120]  their businesses not running as usual that are with, that are located within the nation
[23:55.120 --> 23:56.120]  of chop.
[23:56.120 --> 23:57.720]  So that might be happening right now.
[23:57.720 --> 24:02.920]  We saw some people trying to get a hold of the city, other than that, I mean, it's been
[24:02.920 --> 24:07.240]  more of a, of like a party atmosphere versus like a protest atmosphere.
[24:07.240 --> 24:11.560]  So I don't know, I don't know what's going to happen in the next coming week, but we'll
[24:11.560 --> 24:16.560]  see, you know, if the nation of chop decides to just declare their independence from America
[24:16.560 --> 24:18.040]  and keep this thing going.
[24:18.040 --> 24:19.040]  All right.
[24:19.040 --> 24:23.960]  Well, look, if we get word that the president's ready to nuke chop, we'll let you know and
[24:23.960 --> 24:24.960]  get you out of there.
[24:24.960 --> 24:25.960]  Okay.
[24:25.960 --> 24:26.960]  Sounds good.
[24:26.960 --> 24:30.920]  All right, Sam, go, go on your next mission now.
[24:30.920 --> 24:32.560]  And we'll be hearing again from them.
[24:32.560 --> 24:37.520]  I'm sure before the end of the show, it's just such a clown world right now, folks.
[24:37.520 --> 24:39.360]  You know, I've got two minutes here.
[24:39.360 --> 24:43.200]  Let me just do this before I get some of this news because I really needed to focus when
[24:43.200 --> 24:45.960]  I bear down on this, but let me just give you a quick example of what we're dealing
[24:45.960 --> 24:46.960]  with here.
[24:46.960 --> 24:51.720]  You see, the left has never been about facts.
[24:51.720 --> 24:53.720]  I went and looked into this and it's true.
[24:53.720 --> 25:00.920]  The 13th amendment, which was the abolishment of slavery had 100% Republican support in
[25:00.920 --> 25:03.600]  Congress, 23 Democrat support.
[25:03.600 --> 25:04.600]  Okay.
[25:04.600 --> 25:10.440]  So again, it's the Democrat party of the KKK of the races, the 14th amendment gave citizenship
[25:10.440 --> 25:14.920]  to freed slaves, 94% Republican support, 0% Democrat support.
[25:14.920 --> 25:20.160]  It was literally the party of slavery folks, 15th amendment, right to vote for all 100%
[25:20.160 --> 25:24.800]  Republican support, 0% Democrat support.
[25:24.800 --> 25:30.480]  And then just as kind of an add on Obamacare, 0% Republican support, 86% Democrat support.
[25:30.480 --> 25:32.600]  But that's kind of just a wash.
[25:32.600 --> 25:35.240]  But the point is you'll never see this in the media.
[25:35.240 --> 25:37.760]  You'll never see this talked about.
[25:37.760 --> 25:39.800]  You'll never see this on Google.
[25:39.800 --> 25:42.840]  You have to go do deep research to even find this stuff.
[25:42.840 --> 25:45.920]  And I learned the hard way, folks, because what I also learned doing this research was
[25:45.920 --> 25:53.280]  that the civil rights act was actually filibustered, the longest filibuster in the United States
[25:53.280 --> 25:54.280]  history.
[25:54.280 --> 26:01.240]  You can look, look this up and it was done by Democrats, specifically Strom Thurmond.
[26:01.240 --> 26:06.840]  Now, so I went to do a little more research on old Strom Thurmond and Google claims he's
[26:06.840 --> 26:07.840]  Republican.
[26:07.840 --> 26:08.840]  Hmm.
[26:08.840 --> 26:15.360]  Google claims Strom Thurmond is Republican, but you go do the research and here's just
[26:15.360 --> 26:16.360]  one example.
[26:16.360 --> 26:18.040]  This is from history.com.
[26:18.040 --> 26:26.640]  No, Strom Thurmond was actually a very strong Democrat and Dixie Cratt out of the South.
[26:26.640 --> 26:29.960]  So he was a strong Democrat.
[26:29.960 --> 26:32.880]  The reason why I became a Dixie Cratt was because he was against some of the things
[26:32.880 --> 26:35.480]  that Truman was doing.
[26:35.480 --> 26:37.720]  But no, he was not a Republican.
[26:37.720 --> 26:42.280]  So it's just like when you search on Google, who is the part of the KKK?
[26:42.280 --> 26:43.280]  It's historically known.
[26:43.280 --> 26:44.280]  It's Democrats.
[26:44.280 --> 26:47.000]  Google has rewritten that history and now claim it's Republican.
[26:47.000 --> 26:52.800]  And now they're literally switching the political affiliation of the Democrats that fought to
[26:52.800 --> 26:55.320]  keep black people enslaved as Republicans.
[26:55.320 --> 26:56.960]  This is an attack on our country.
[26:56.960 --> 26:59.520]  I was talking to my Patriots supplier, great suppliers.
[26:59.520 --> 27:02.480]  You can now say four weeks on average for storable food.
[27:02.480 --> 27:03.560]  It's the highest quality.
[27:03.560 --> 27:05.000]  They've got it.
[27:05.000 --> 27:08.840]  Use this little rest we have caught in the current to come up to the service.
[27:08.840 --> 27:11.200]  Get some air before you get sucked back down.
[27:11.200 --> 27:13.720]  I personally am ordering more storable food.
[27:13.720 --> 27:20.080]  I have to now start going into defense posture, 80% offense, but I've always been 100% offense
[27:20.080 --> 27:23.600]  trying to fully, you know, stop the globalists and we've given them a good run.
[27:23.600 --> 27:25.320]  And I think down the road, they'll be defeated.
[27:25.320 --> 27:29.440]  But we're going to still go down the hard road now.
[27:29.440 --> 27:30.440]  There were a lot worse roads.
[27:30.440 --> 27:31.440]  We'd probably go down.
[27:31.440 --> 27:35.320]  But we've mitigated some of this, but it's still going to be bad, my view.
[27:35.320 --> 27:36.800]  You need to get high quality, sort of food.

[29:59.920 --> 30:06.920]  Start listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:06.920 --> 30:18.680]  Hi, I'm the CEO of every major company in America.
[30:18.680 --> 30:23.320]  I just wanted to take the time to say that here at my company, black lives matter.
[30:23.320 --> 30:27.840]  I know we spent all of February virtue signaling, I mean, speaking to the black community, but
[30:27.840 --> 30:31.840]  sometimes current events happen and in order to make sure you social justice warriors continue
[30:31.840 --> 30:36.960]  making me richer, I simply can't stand by in a situation like this go to waste.
[30:36.960 --> 30:41.320]  Last year, only nine unarmed black men were shot and killed by the police, but now is
[30:41.320 --> 30:43.160]  not the time for facts.
[30:43.160 --> 30:47.840]  Now is the time for feelings.
[30:47.840 --> 30:51.800]  Please continue to destroy your own communities and burning down businesses as long as they're
[30:51.800 --> 30:52.800]  not mine.
[30:52.800 --> 30:56.520]  We support you acting like hoodlums now more than ever and we want you to feel comfortable
[30:56.520 --> 30:59.520]  giving us what little money you have left when this is all over.
[30:59.520 --> 31:03.360]  I promise I will continue to publicly support whatever opinions will make you keep liking
[31:03.360 --> 31:10.240]  me black lives matter, especially when it helps my bottom line to say that have a great
[31:10.240 --> 31:19.160]  day and orange man, very, very bad message from CEO of every major company, P Anders.
[31:19.160 --> 31:26.040]  Actually that was the brilliant work of Demani Felder there is putting it really, you can't
[31:26.040 --> 31:33.360]  explain it except with comedy sometimes and you know, we're at a very interesting cross
[31:33.360 --> 31:39.200]  road right now in America and every American is going to have to make a conscious decision
[31:39.200 --> 31:47.120]  about how they're going to fight for the country, fight for this nation at this crossroads
[31:47.120 --> 31:50.800]  and it could be simple as okay, because it's really easy.
[31:50.800 --> 31:54.120]  We know the propaganda and then as soon as they put out the propaganda, boom, they're
[31:54.120 --> 31:57.640]  tagged as anti-American globalist like with BLM.
[31:57.640 --> 32:00.760]  I start getting BLM mass messages from certain things.
[32:00.760 --> 32:01.760]  I'm out.
[32:01.760 --> 32:02.760]  I'm done.
[32:02.760 --> 32:03.760]  NFL, I'm done with you.
[32:03.760 --> 32:04.760]  I'm never spending another dime.
[32:04.760 --> 32:06.640]  I'm going to cancel my NFL package.
[32:06.640 --> 32:07.920]  I've always been a football fan.
[32:07.920 --> 32:08.920]  I'm done.
[32:08.920 --> 32:09.920]  I can't watch it.
[32:09.920 --> 32:10.920]  You hate me.
[32:10.920 --> 32:11.920]  You hate my country.
[32:11.920 --> 32:12.920]  I'm done with you.
[32:12.920 --> 32:13.920]  Sucks.
[32:13.920 --> 32:15.240]  I like watching football.
[32:15.240 --> 32:16.600]  I like the NFL, but you know what?
[32:16.600 --> 32:17.600]  You're anti-American.
[32:17.600 --> 32:18.600]  You're against me.
[32:18.600 --> 32:19.600]  You're my enemy now.
[32:19.600 --> 32:22.920]  You tagged yourself as my enemy, so I'm done with you.
[32:22.920 --> 32:25.560]  And every American should do this.
[32:25.560 --> 32:27.160]  Cancel your NFL package.
[32:27.160 --> 32:28.880]  Don't go to the damn game.
[32:28.880 --> 32:30.600]  Don't watch the game.
[32:30.600 --> 32:34.840]  Believe me, if I can do that, you can do that.
[32:34.840 --> 32:35.840]  It goes on.
[32:35.840 --> 32:38.440]  Same with the NBA.
[32:38.440 --> 32:41.400]  When I go out shopping, I went shopping this weekend.
[32:41.400 --> 32:44.520]  Needed some shoes and some shirts and stuff.
[32:44.520 --> 32:47.560]  I will not buy a product made in China.
[32:47.560 --> 32:49.400]  Will not do it.
[32:49.400 --> 32:50.400]  Refuse.
[32:50.400 --> 32:53.640]  Now, I'm not perfect.
[32:53.640 --> 32:59.640]  I got shoes made in Indonesia, shirt made in Vietnam, Macau.
[32:59.640 --> 33:00.640]  Does that count?
[33:00.640 --> 33:01.640]  Taiwan?
[33:01.640 --> 33:02.640]  Does that count?
[33:02.640 --> 33:03.640]  You've got to make these decisions.
[33:03.640 --> 33:07.640]  But until Americans start fighting back, at least economically in some way, shape or
[33:07.640 --> 33:10.240]  form, then there's no victory.
[33:10.240 --> 33:17.280]  Then they can just tag with their BLM or whatever it is, anti-Trump message, and you still buy
[33:17.280 --> 33:18.280]  their products.
[33:18.280 --> 33:24.400]  Well, then they can just do whatever they want to you, and they lie to you all day long.
[33:24.400 --> 33:26.200]  But let's just focus on this real quick here.
[33:26.200 --> 33:30.600]  I think I can do this in six minutes to just show you how out of control this whole thing
[33:30.600 --> 33:31.600]  really is.
[33:31.600 --> 33:38.360]  Now, it doesn't matter, the story is at infowars.com, that police misconduct claims falls to 10
[33:38.360 --> 33:41.560]  year low in New York City.
[33:41.560 --> 33:47.520]  Again, police work just keeps getting better, but the media keeps getting more evil.
[33:47.520 --> 33:51.080]  And so what happens?
[33:51.080 --> 33:53.800]  All black lives matter, painted on Hollywood Boulevard.
[33:53.800 --> 33:59.000]  Now it's in DC, it's in Hollywood, it's over here, but if somebody put up a white lives
[33:59.000 --> 34:04.800]  matter sign on a college campus or a white lives matter sign on their building or on
[34:04.800 --> 34:10.040]  their apartment or something, oh, you're racist, you're bad.
[34:10.040 --> 34:11.560]  So what is this really about?
[34:11.560 --> 34:16.040]  Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of the American Revolution vandalized in Philadelphia's Washington
[34:16.040 --> 34:17.040]  Square.
[34:17.040 --> 34:22.160]  It's just just roll because we got some more b-roll from the weekend, the staged beating
[34:22.160 --> 34:28.760]  of Trump and Chaz, the woman who had her car smashed in the glass got on her dog.
[34:28.760 --> 34:31.880]  Just roll the b-roll of some of the violence from over the weekend because just realize
[34:31.880 --> 34:34.400]  folks, this hasn't stopped the violence and the rioting.
[34:34.400 --> 34:44.080]  It hasn't stopped Jefferson Thomas Jefferson statue torn down from Portland High School.
[34:44.080 --> 34:50.240]  I believe that there's other ones too, they're just taking down statues everywhere.
[34:50.240 --> 34:56.280]  Most of them are actually Democrats, including almost every single one Nancy Pelosi said
[34:56.280 --> 35:01.080]  needs to be torn down, all except two were Democrats.
[35:01.080 --> 35:09.720]  So the left is out rioting, destroying property, stealing, murdering, and it's all for the
[35:09.720 --> 35:10.720]  cause, folks.
[35:10.720 --> 35:12.640]  See, it's all for the cause.
[35:12.640 --> 35:13.640]  And what is that cause?
[35:13.640 --> 35:17.240]  Well, they don't really know, but the cause is to destroy America.
[35:17.240 --> 35:20.040]  But they may know that and they may like that.
[35:20.040 --> 35:23.480]  And they've been deceived into Stockholm syndrome into thinking that somehow benefits
[35:23.480 --> 35:25.480]  them.
[35:25.480 --> 35:31.840]  Tucker Carlson, folks, is the last real news man on television, perhaps.
[35:31.840 --> 35:36.560]  Against the tide, my pillow CEO, Mike Lindell, refuses to pull ads from Tucker Carlson tonight.
[35:36.560 --> 35:37.560]  Everyone's pulling ads.
[35:37.560 --> 35:41.000]  He won't buy into the BLM, so he gets attacked viciously.
[35:41.000 --> 35:42.640]  They try to take him off air.
[35:42.640 --> 35:47.520]  He'll be, it will be lucky if he's on air in October.
[35:47.520 --> 35:53.720]  UK police officers told to take a knee for BLM protesters or they could lose their job.
[35:53.720 --> 35:59.400]  BLM branded kill a white on site posters.
[35:59.400 --> 36:02.360]  So that's not racist at all.
[36:02.360 --> 36:09.120]  Seattle's Chas retry all nonwhite violent convicts with nonwhite jurors.
[36:09.120 --> 36:15.840]  Okay, but, but, you know, these people are for Martin Luther King and then all they do
[36:15.840 --> 36:18.720]  is see skin color.
[36:18.720 --> 36:22.800]  Those not on board with French Revolution were chops Chas protesters worn after renaming
[36:22.800 --> 36:24.800]  their camp.
[36:24.800 --> 36:31.440]  I don't know why we're allowing this to happen video Chas resident says white America will
[36:31.440 --> 36:34.440]  see more burning and looting if they don't get it right folks.
[36:34.440 --> 36:35.960]  This is all of our America.
[36:35.960 --> 36:42.400]  It's not white America, black America, brown America, Asian, no, it's America.
[36:42.400 --> 36:52.680]  The left is destroying it viciously, violently, unrelentingly, unchallenged police officers
[36:52.680 --> 37:01.640]  shot in the head during BLM protest paralyzed from neck down.
[37:01.640 --> 37:04.440]  Now you've got Ray shard Brooks.
[37:04.440 --> 37:08.760]  Now here's the story on ABC news Ray shard Brooks went from telling Atlanta officer about
[37:08.760 --> 37:11.560]  visiting mother's grave to being fatally shot.
[37:11.560 --> 37:16.000]  And so now now Ray shard Brooks is the new George Floyd.
[37:16.000 --> 37:20.560]  Now look again, you want to get into the law.
[37:20.560 --> 37:21.560]  We can get into law.
[37:21.560 --> 37:22.560]  The guy's on probation.
[37:22.560 --> 37:24.440]  The guy was drinking and driving me.
[37:24.440 --> 37:29.280]  What if Ray shard Brooks gets in a car accident night and kills somebody because he was drunk
[37:29.280 --> 37:30.280]  with the media care?
[37:30.280 --> 37:33.960]  What if it was a little black girl with her mom with the media care?
[37:33.960 --> 37:39.280]  Absolutely not couldn't care less, but he gets caught drinking and driving, violating
[37:39.280 --> 37:40.280]  parole.
[37:40.280 --> 37:48.360]  And by the way, he was in jail for seven years released because of COVID for domestic violence.
[37:48.360 --> 37:52.480]  And guess how many times any of that is mentioned in this story from ABC news that went that
[37:52.480 --> 37:58.240]  was the number one trending story, zero times, ladies and gentlemen, zero times.
[37:58.240 --> 38:04.080]  This man resisted arrest, attempted to taze an officer.
[38:04.080 --> 38:07.240]  And you try to get in a scuffle with someone with a gun, you're probably going to get shot.
[38:07.240 --> 38:09.520]  But if it's an officer, they're not allowed to.
[38:09.520 --> 38:12.280]  So here's the scuffle that they won't show you on mainstream news.
[38:12.280 --> 38:17.660]  So this is the one that they're going to now drum up to cause more race riots in this country.
[38:17.660 --> 38:20.560]  More protests planned for Monday after Atlanta shooting.
[38:20.560 --> 38:26.000]  Oh, but the media have forgot these stories.
[38:26.000 --> 38:31.920]  Four people charged in shooting death of 13 year old boy in Chester, Pennsylvania.
[38:31.920 --> 38:37.000]  The boy was white, the people charged or excuse me, actually the boy was black.
[38:37.000 --> 38:38.000]  Excuse me.
[38:38.000 --> 38:42.520]  The people charged are black, but nobody cares about those black lives.
[38:42.520 --> 38:50.960]  Perry PD charges woman with kidnapping sexually abusing 14 year old, 14 year old black woman
[38:50.960 --> 38:51.960]  charged black.
[38:51.960 --> 38:53.720]  Nobody cares about those black lives.
[38:53.720 --> 39:01.000]  Three suspects in custody after off duty FWC officer shot and killed that officer, Julian
[39:01.000 --> 39:04.520]  King Jr. 30 year old black male dead.
[39:04.520 --> 39:06.520]  This is his life matter.
[39:06.520 --> 39:07.800]  No.
[39:07.800 --> 39:09.400]  And now this is what Alex was talking about.
[39:09.400 --> 39:10.400]  And this is it folks.
[39:10.400 --> 39:17.320]  This is really what this whole agenda is to disband the police and bring in the UN police
[39:17.320 --> 39:21.680]  officers all over America are quitting their jobs because of the Floyd protest.
[39:21.680 --> 39:25.240]  And because they're just getting thrown under the bus by their leadership.
[39:25.240 --> 39:30.880]  And then in force.com United Nations openly hijacks US police department.
[39:30.880 --> 39:32.640]  So that's the whole thing folks.
[39:32.640 --> 39:40.000]  Get the police out by hook or by crook and then bring in the UN.
[39:40.000 --> 39:43.000]  And that's what we're in the middle of.
[39:43.000 --> 39:48.000]  And these poor brainwashed souls really think they're fighting for some justice because
[39:48.000 --> 39:52.280]  on CNN they said racism is a problem in America.
[39:52.280 --> 39:56.200]  And these rich billionaires and millionaires that are black told them too.
[39:56.200 --> 40:01.320]  It's finally here introducing the first of its kind nascent iodine spray with true atomic
[40:01.320 --> 40:02.320]  iodine.

[41:02.040 --> 41:08.040]  Globalists have gotten away with their Russiagate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their COVID-19 hoax
[41:08.040 --> 41:15.400]  and now it's the race riot hoax of 2020.
[41:15.400 --> 41:18.720]  We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next, well I can tell you, it's going to be a bunch
[41:18.720 --> 41:23.360]  of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race war.
[41:23.360 --> 41:29.120]  It's going to be economic collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it, the
[41:29.120 --> 41:34.280]  globalists are attacking on every front, that's why now more than ever we have to realize
[41:34.280 --> 41:38.960]  they tried to censor info wars off the air because they knew that when they launched
[41:38.960 --> 41:43.360]  this whole situation that they did want the people's voice to still be on air, but thanks
[41:43.360 --> 41:47.240]  to you and our crew we are still on air.
[41:47.240 --> 41:53.520]  So let's boost that transmission like the Batman signal now more than ever, info wars.com
[41:53.520 --> 41:57.160]  lives.
[41:57.160 --> 42:01.840]  What info wars has been able to do thanks to your support and your prayers and your word
[42:01.840 --> 42:07.080]  of mouth has been nothing short of historic and truly epic.
[42:07.080 --> 42:14.440]  This is the battle for the future of humanity and now open world government is being established
[42:14.440 --> 42:18.200]  with an end game to depopulate the planet.
[42:18.200 --> 42:24.680]  Now the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized, you must decide which
[42:24.680 --> 42:26.200]  side you're on.
[42:26.200 --> 42:32.200]  Living in denial, having mask dot com syndrome, learned help will only deliver you into misery,
[42:32.200 --> 42:34.200]  destruction and finally death.
[42:34.200 --> 42:40.280]  And this is a spiritual death we're talking about, not just a physical death, the delusions
[42:40.280 --> 42:42.440]  must end now.
[42:42.440 --> 42:47.800]  Info wars was correct about it all and we have come so far by exposing the enemy.
[42:47.800 --> 42:50.880]  Most people that are aware of the new world will decide to join it out of fear.
[42:50.880 --> 42:52.880]  They are truly fools.
[42:52.880 --> 42:56.280]  We must fight this or lose our souls.
[42:56.280 --> 43:01.760]  The people of the world have awakened to globalism and so populist movements are throwing the
[43:01.760 --> 43:04.720]  globalist out of their countries.
[43:04.720 --> 43:09.200]  That's why the new world order is instituting race war and division and telling the people
[43:09.200 --> 43:14.560]  that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government and destroying
[43:14.560 --> 43:16.520]  essential services.
[43:16.520 --> 43:21.680]  This is an attempt to have society collapse and the globalists as they've done in the
[43:21.680 --> 43:24.760]  third world will come in and pick up the pieces.
[43:24.760 --> 43:30.200]  We must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank and the EU openly saying we fund
[43:30.200 --> 43:31.360]  the police.
[43:31.360 --> 43:32.680]  The police have a lot of problems.
[43:32.680 --> 43:34.080]  We all have a lot of problems.
[43:34.080 --> 43:38.360]  But this is our government and our local establishment and believe me, once the globalists have overthrown
[43:38.360 --> 43:43.000]  this country, they are going to put in a real police state where you have no due process
[43:43.000 --> 43:44.000]  or freedom.
[43:44.000 --> 43:48.360]  The globalists believe communist China is the model of the world and they are orchestrating
[43:48.360 --> 43:49.680]  this entire thing.
[43:49.680 --> 43:55.960]  The people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed, infowars.com.
[44:19.680 --> 44:31.600]  The good news is America is waking up.
[44:31.600 --> 44:35.960]  The silent majority is larger than ever.
[44:35.960 --> 44:38.280]  The democrat party politically is dead.
[44:38.280 --> 44:48.200]  The problem is this evil, deceptive establishment is so entrenched and so powerful, it's not
[44:48.200 --> 44:59.040]  going to just go away and it's going to continue to just morph like a oozing blob until it
[44:59.040 --> 45:03.160]  can fully corrupt everything that is America.
[45:03.160 --> 45:12.120]  All of its institutions, all of its industries, all of its art and culture and entertainment
[45:12.120 --> 45:14.600]  and we're in that stage.
[45:14.600 --> 45:23.560]  Now like a white blood cell or an antibody fighting a disease, we're creating more antibodies
[45:23.560 --> 45:30.600]  and we're trying to fight this cancer but it is metastasizing and it is getting more
[45:30.600 --> 45:37.080]  and more deadly.
[45:37.080 --> 45:48.680]  Now let me finish up with kind of some of the stuff that we're witnessing from over
[45:48.680 --> 45:55.120]  the weekend and there's going to be more to come.
[45:55.120 --> 46:01.400]  And then we'll kind of change to the coronavirus hoax round two that they're about to initiate.
[46:01.400 --> 46:06.320]  So they're going to round up and get the race riots round two going and then so they'll
[46:06.320 --> 46:10.560]  be promoting all of that but then they'll also say you can't run a business or go to
[46:10.560 --> 46:17.440]  a church service or have a funeral or anything even though they're out promoting their protests
[46:17.440 --> 46:22.400]  and riots and it just exposes the total fraud of these people.
[46:22.400 --> 46:26.520]  But America sees it but again the cancer is already here, the cancer is already killing
[46:26.520 --> 46:35.600]  us but I want to give you fair warning so if there are any children or anything watching
[46:35.600 --> 46:39.360]  this folks I'm going to air a video that's very graphic right now.
[46:39.360 --> 46:43.680]  Now there's no nudity or cursing or anything and we won't even play the audio but I just
[46:43.680 --> 46:50.120]  want to air this but look if you don't want your kids to see this or you don't want, it
[46:50.120 --> 46:55.960]  could be deemed inappropriate here so just want to give you fair warning if your child
[46:55.960 --> 47:00.080]  is watching or there's somebody watching you don't want to see this go ahead and have them
[47:00.080 --> 47:05.800]  tune out right now but to me this video just shows you the total degradation of society,
[47:05.800 --> 47:11.520]  the total degeneration of the left and actually I do want to air this audio because it is
[47:11.520 --> 47:20.800]  important actually to hear this getting celebrated but basically you have a woman lined off against
[47:20.800 --> 47:27.320]  the line of police doing a strip tease and literally getting cheered on by the audience
[47:27.320 --> 47:32.640]  even one woman from the audience goes up and slaps her butt in the middle of this strip
[47:32.640 --> 47:33.640]  tease.
[47:33.640 --> 47:40.400]  Now you see something like this and it's just this is total mental illness, this is complete
[47:40.400 --> 47:47.760]  societal degeneration but America needs to see what the left is, what it's become and
[47:47.760 --> 47:53.280]  where it all goes if it's not met at this crossroads right now and nipped in the bud
[47:53.280 --> 48:00.120]  at least here in the west so again just fair warning folks this video is not there's no
[48:00.120 --> 48:06.000]  nudity or anything but it's about as close as you can get to simulating a sexual act
[48:06.000 --> 48:09.200]  live on the street so pretty soon they'll probably start having sex right in front of
[48:09.200 --> 48:14.160]  police like right on their riot shield or something so here's this lady empowering herself by
[48:14.160 --> 48:24.400]  doing a strip tease in front of the police getting cheered on by the audience again folks
[48:24.400 --> 48:28.840]  I'm sorry for any graphic nature and then she's literally humping I'm not even kidding
[48:28.840 --> 48:34.240]  you humping the cement while a woman comes in and slaps her butt now she's doing the
[48:34.240 --> 48:40.800]  full splits and simulating a sexual act on herself and it's getting cheered on and they
[48:40.800 --> 48:46.920]  say F Trump and this is cheered this is celebrated total societal degeneration she has a black
[48:46.920 --> 48:55.080]  lives matter t-shirt on way to go girl way to go way to show us that black lives matter
[48:55.080 --> 49:01.920]  by mooning us and giving us a strip show way to go you're now a whore congratulations
[49:01.920 --> 49:08.760]  you're now officially a street hooker you work for free by the way they didn't even have
[49:08.760 --> 49:12.360]  to go to the strip club and pay 50 bucks or whatever for that you gave them that show
[49:12.360 --> 49:18.320]  for free and you thought you empowered yourself you thought you empowered black people by
[49:18.320 --> 49:29.800]  doing that a sick disgusting freak this is what the media has done to the youth this
[49:29.800 --> 49:36.440]  is what the media has done oh and now though they say well we can't have Elmer Fudd on
[49:36.440 --> 49:43.560]  TV or Yosemite Sam on TV with a gun because you know that's going to make people violent
[49:43.560 --> 49:48.360]  even though all the kids that grew up watching Looney Tunes with Yosemite Sam and the rest
[49:48.360 --> 49:55.920]  they didn't go out shooting up schools never an issue for them oh but I'm sure all the
[49:55.920 --> 50:01.600]  rap videos and the Jay Z's and the Cardi B's and the Kim Kardashian's and the porn
[50:01.600 --> 50:06.880]  and all of it oh I'm sure that's perfectly fine we don't need to stop kids from seeing
[50:06.880 --> 50:10.640]  that we need to continue to promote that on the internet continue to promote that on all
[50:10.640 --> 50:16.000]  the apps that the children have like Snapchat so that your daughter can grow up to be a
[50:16.000 --> 50:22.160]  street hooker doing free strip shows on the streets of the city humping cement playing
[50:22.160 --> 50:31.560]  with herself that's what we need but see nobody complains about Jay Z or all the rappers
[50:31.560 --> 50:36.600]  that did this to black people nobody complains about Jay Z and all the other rappers out
[50:36.600 --> 50:40.760]  there that told black people hey it's our culture now to be a gangster and pimp and
[50:40.760 --> 50:49.440]  hoe and do drugs and strip that was Jay Z that wasn't Donald Trump that was Jay Z that
[50:49.440 --> 50:56.040]  wasn't your white neighbor that wasn't the police officer no that was mainstream entertainment
[50:56.040 --> 51:15.920]  just mind boggling it's just how sick and twisted the media's really become to demonize
[51:15.920 --> 51:26.240]  police or to demonize a cartoon gun but to ignore the vamp it just total just ramped
[51:26.240 --> 51:33.280]  up smut that they feed children and call it mainstream entertainment and music and art
[51:33.280 --> 51:47.240]  and culture it's filth it's trash it's cancer oh you can't sing it's be or what is it it's

[52:02.880 --> 52:09.360]  that's cool that's hit but oh that Christmas song that suggested a man and a woman being
[52:09.360 --> 52:13.480]  carrying and tender and loving to one another we need to cancel that but Cardi B that strips

[52:28.320 --> 52:32.400]  bad if you're a Christian you're told you're bad if you're a Trump supporter oh and if

[53:31.880 --> 53:40.840]  and if my skin is white I feel like a black woman and I want to play in the WNBA because
[53:40.840 --> 53:45.960]  I'm a black woman of course that's ridiculous but if you're a leftist then it's okay because
[53:45.960 --> 53:51.000]  all these Antifa terrorists they're arresting all these tranny Antifa terrorists they have
[53:51.000 --> 53:54.520]  a five o'clock shadow when they're out on the street saying oh I'm a woman don't harass
[53:54.520 --> 54:01.720]  me it's okay for them to joke around and play games but oh not you folks and everybody
[54:01.720 --> 54:05.760]  knows what is the real discrimination in this country what is the true discrimination in
[54:05.760 --> 54:09.840]  this country if you're a Christian if you're a conservative if you're a Trump supporter
[54:09.840 --> 54:17.600]  if you're white that's the real discrimination ask any black person or any gay person that's
[54:17.600 --> 54:23.360]  a conservative Trump supporter and they will tell you they have dealt with 100 times the
[54:23.360 --> 54:28.640]  discrimination in bigotry for being a Trump supporter or a Christian or a conservative
[54:28.640 --> 54:33.560]  then they've ever dealt with for being gay or black but hey guys we got to indoctrinate
[54:33.560 --> 54:39.800]  the children Nickelodeon celebrates pride month by announcing Spongebob is gay Spongebob
[54:39.800 --> 54:44.000]  is a member of the LGBTQ community even though the crater before he died said no he's not
[54:44.000 --> 54:51.960]  gay well now he is gay it's finally here introducing the new survival shield x2 spray

[55:37.600 --> 55:47.360] warstore.com that's survival shield x2 spray at infowarstore.com
[55:47.360 --> 55:52.380]  the panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporates media and the chai comms
[55:52.380 --> 55:58.960]  is going to now trigger a worldwide depression fact we're already into the worldwide depression
[55:58.960 --> 56:03.760]  in the death sentence for the third world but it's critical to understand that the longer
[56:03.760 --> 56:10.480]  the shutdown persists the worse it's going to be a month of shutdown will destroy decades
[56:10.480 --> 56:14.440]  of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy that's what we've always said it's
[56:14.440 --> 56:18.840]  important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists want
[56:18.840 --> 56:24.600]  to make us all dependent so that we're under their control they've admitted all of this
[56:24.600 --> 56:30.880]  so remember how does info wars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict
[56:30.880 --> 56:36.440]  things before they happen because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan
[56:36.440 --> 56:41.240]  and yes it's dystopic and yes it's scary but denying it and letting them carry it out
[56:41.240 --> 56:45.760]  is a thousand times more scary it's time to stop the denial and realize what's really
[56:45.760 --> 57:12.080]  happening you're listening to the alex jones show ladies and gentlemen we will be hearing
[57:12.080 --> 57:19.440]  again from alex jones coming up in the third hour on the planned un takeover of local police
[57:19.440 --> 57:24.080]  departments i don't think that's going to go how they want it to go but in an ironic
[57:24.080 --> 57:29.180]  twist since you know all these protesters hate the police so much i wonder if they'll
[57:29.180 --> 57:34.080]  hate the un police or if they'll just bow down to that if don lemon tells them to but
[57:34.080 --> 57:40.080]  i wanted to play this video which is from ten or more years ago i couldn't find the exact
[57:40.080 --> 57:47.880]  date but basically a civil rights leftist progressive activist who's against police brutality specifically
[57:47.880 --> 57:53.320]  deadly force decided to actually take a training course on what the police have to go through
[57:53.320 --> 57:58.320]  and the certain different city situations were deadly force may or may not be necessary
[57:58.320 --> 58:02.520]  and he went through this course and he came out on the other side with a different perspective
[58:02.520 --> 58:06.560]  and again this is from ten or more years ago i couldn't locate the exact date but i think
[58:06.560 --> 58:11.800]  it's very important to again have some empathy for police in these situations because you
[58:11.800 --> 58:15.480]  know their people too but i guess their lives don't matter if you're a progressive democrat
[58:15.480 --> 58:19.880]  but here was a civil rights activists anti police brutality activists who went through
[58:19.880 --> 58:25.560]  some of the training and came out on the other end with a different perspective you're looking
[58:25.560 --> 58:29.920]  for your vehicle what kind of car do you drive what kind of car do you drive it's my car
[58:29.920 --> 58:39.600]  man mopping the officer is shot it happens that fast at what time did you think that
[58:39.600 --> 58:43.600]  it was time for you to address the use of force that was given when he came to the back
[58:43.600 --> 58:50.120]  of the vehicle uh and and was hiding you know i could sense something something was wrong
[58:50.120 --> 58:57.720]  scenario two a call of two men fighting what's going on today gentlemen what's going on today
[58:57.720 --> 59:05.120]  gentlemen what do you want what's happening here what's wrong with you what are you doing
[59:05.120 --> 59:09.880]  man hey hey he shouldn't approach me he shouldn't approach me he shouldn't approach me he shouldn't
[59:09.880 --> 59:16.200]  approach me what's happening there yeah what are you doing you just shot him hey he rushed
[59:16.200 --> 59:21.120]  me tell me why you shot well i i've shot because he was within that zone you know i felt there
[59:21.120 --> 59:27.240]  was a an imminent threat i i didn't necessarily see him armed but he he came clearly to do
[59:27.240 --> 59:33.040]  some harm to uh to the officer to my person it's hard to make that call it's uh it shakes
[59:33.040 --> 59:39.560]  you up again an unarmed man was shot scenario three a call about a possible burglar walking
[59:39.560 --> 59:43.600]  down the street mopping gets him on the ground he's not compliant i need you to keep your
[59:43.600 --> 59:49.200]  hands up sir for what because i need to check that waistband well what what are you doing
[59:49.200 --> 59:53.000]  because i don't know what you have under there everybody look at this guy what are you doing
[59:53.000 --> 59:58.640]  no shots fired but the suspect did have a hidden knife in his waistband i went through the scenarios
[59:58.640 --> 1:00:03.240]  too without seeing what mopping did so uh do you have keys or uh do you have anything to
[1:00:03.240 --> 1:00:11.840]  show me that no i need to talk to you come on come on out over here well i'm dead there
[1:00:11.840 --> 1:00:15.760]  are a couple of county sheriffs get on the ground get on the ground both of you get on
[1:00:15.760 --> 1:00:22.720]  the ground get on the ground for what get back get back same results for both of us
[1:00:22.720 --> 1:00:28.080]  things happen very fast out here i asked mopping what is biggest takeaway from this exercise
[1:00:28.080 --> 1:00:33.040]  will be i didn't understand how important uh compliance was but but after going through
[1:00:33.040 --> 1:00:39.440]  this yeah my attitude has has changed uh this is all unfolding in in 10 to 15 seconds um
[1:00:39.440 --> 1:00:44.600]  people need to comply with the with the orders of law enforcement officers for their own sake
[1:00:44.600 --> 1:00:49.160]  so again ladies and gentlemen a um now here's thinking that was from at least 10 years ago
[1:00:49.160 --> 1:00:55.600]  i couldn't get the exact date here here's what's sad about that your average leftist
[1:00:55.600 --> 1:01:01.480]  activist back then was not nearly as vitriolic and hate filled and violent as they are now
[1:01:01.480 --> 1:01:05.000]  and so that man was probably opinionated about some things but he went in with an open mind
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:08.320]  you could tell he was fair about his conclusion and his analysis and his experience and he
[1:01:08.320 --> 1:01:13.280]  said hey you know what i'm a little more empathetic towards police officers now i'm afraid that
[1:01:13.280 --> 1:01:19.920]  that window of opportunities closed and so there's there the good news in this is that
[1:01:19.920 --> 1:01:24.840]  americans that can actually think for themselves and don't have hatred in their heart and and
[1:01:24.840 --> 1:01:30.840]  just want to live in america if they were ever in a gray neutral zone there's no gray
[1:01:30.840 --> 1:01:35.880]  neutral zone anymore anymore folks and the left has done this obama is now considered
[1:01:35.880 --> 1:01:40.920]  a centrist think about that that's how far the left is gone so either you hate police
[1:01:40.920 --> 1:01:45.720]  and you want to see all police and all why these die which is the now left or you're
[1:01:45.720 --> 1:01:51.280]  just like hey i kind of like america and i'd like to live in america that's the the demarcation
[1:01:51.280 --> 1:01:58.600]  line we're at now i was talking to my patreon supplier great suppliers you can now say four
[1:01:58.600 --> 1:02:03.760]  weeks on average for storable food it's the highest quality they've got it use this little
[1:02:03.760 --> 1:02:08.080]  rest we have caught in the current to come up to the service get some air before you
[1:02:08.080 --> 1:02:12.880]  get sucked back down i personally am ordering more storeable food i have to now start going
[1:02:12.880 --> 1:02:19.120]  into defense posture 80% offense but i've always been 100% offense trying to fully you know
[1:02:19.120 --> 1:02:22.560]  stop the globalists and we've given them a good run and i think down the road they'll
[1:02:22.560 --> 1:02:28.320]  be defeated but we are going to still go down the hard road now there were a lot worse roads
[1:02:28.320 --> 1:02:32.600]  we'd probably go down but we've mitigated some of this but it's still gonna be bad my
[1:02:32.600 --> 1:02:36.280]  view you need to get high quality storeable food it's something you need we have high
[1:02:36.280 --> 1:02:40.520]  quality ready to get out to you and it supports the broadcast and 360 wins so please take
[1:02:40.520 --> 1:02:45.800]  care of your storeable foods needs at info or store dot com and get your orders in now
[1:02:45.800 --> 1:02:50.640]  so you get it so you have it some great containers high quality last 25 years get it while you
[1:02:50.640 --> 1:02:53.840]  can because if you think things are about to let up you ain't seen nothing yet
[1:02:53.840 --> 1:03:11.960]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex joneshow and now your
[1:03:11.960 --> 1:03:29.560]  host oen treuer america is on the edge ladies and gentlemen and it really just goes one
[1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:36.000]  of two ways from here and it's really hard to measure the timeline because there's gonna
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:41.960]  be so many different landmines laid out for us before we reach this election and beyond
[1:03:41.960 --> 1:03:49.960]  here in 2020 but right now if this trend plays out and the president does not take serious
[1:03:49.960 --> 1:03:58.960]  action you're probably gonna have to physically fight for this country and that's the worst
[1:03:58.960 --> 1:04:04.480]  case scenario none of us want to deal with it but that's the path we're heading down
[1:04:04.480 --> 1:04:10.360]  right now you will have to physically fight for this country and for your freedom and
[1:04:10.360 --> 1:04:18.640]  for your family i don't know how it's gonna look i don't know how it's gonna go or what
[1:04:18.640 --> 1:04:27.040]  it what it's gonna mean but that's what it's gonna come down to and so yeah you're gonna
[1:04:27.040 --> 1:04:31.680]  need storeable food yeah you're gonna need water filters yeah you're gonna need ammunition
[1:04:31.680 --> 1:04:42.360]  and and guns that's serious i think americans are realizing that right now and and they're
[1:04:42.360 --> 1:04:48.080]  getting battle hardened folks i'm a sounding board for a lot of people a lot of people
[1:04:48.080 --> 1:04:53.560]  here locally and just a lot of people in general media and so on and i'm telling you i'm getting
[1:04:53.560 --> 1:05:00.560]  the same message folks because because you gotta understand this audience is very unique
[1:05:00.560 --> 1:05:10.000]  and we're not in a cult you know that and so yeah there's gonna be support for trump
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:15.640]  there's gonna be people that are gonna have undying support for trump my first priority
[1:05:15.640 --> 1:05:22.120]  is not to support trump but to support america and freedom and truth and reality and justice
[1:05:22.120 --> 1:05:27.920]  trump will decide his own fate but i'm telling you folks it's two two big things that are
[1:05:27.920 --> 1:05:33.240]  happening right now people are seeing what the left really is and getting as far away
[1:05:33.240 --> 1:05:40.600]  from it as possible i mean seriously realizing what it is now so that's good politically
[1:05:40.600 --> 1:05:46.640]  so maybe it'll take 16 years to clean all this up politically we don't have 16 years
[1:05:46.640 --> 1:05:54.560]  we might not even have 16 months the other message i'm getting oh and where is trump
[1:05:54.560 --> 1:05:58.920]  what is he doing he's failing us this isn't winning he promised this he promised that
[1:05:58.920 --> 1:06:07.480]  he keeps tweeting no action well again trump's gonna determine his own destiny the entire
[1:06:07.480 --> 1:06:13.680]  wicked evil establishment is lined up against trump that's undeniable it's also undeniable
[1:06:13.680 --> 1:06:17.600]  that when it comes to all the criminality that the left is engaged in right now very
[1:06:17.600 --> 1:06:23.440]  little if any action at all and all the things that he's done that have been so great can
[1:06:23.440 --> 1:06:28.720]  all be reversed overnight you saw what they did to the booming economy erased it with
[1:06:28.720 --> 1:06:35.240]  a fake pandemic all the foreign policy getting out of the TPP and the Paris climate accord
[1:06:35.240 --> 1:06:42.240]  and all that they'll the net if biden gets in he'll sign us on to all that more they'll
[1:06:42.240 --> 1:06:48.400]  reverse all of it so trump better be focusing on making sure they don't steal this upcoming
[1:06:48.400 --> 1:06:52.920]  election because that is modus operandi number one for the democrats in fact here's stacey
[1:06:52.920 --> 1:07:01.200]  abrams projecting this telling you the democrat plan but as usual it's like if somebody hands
[1:07:01.200 --> 1:07:07.320]  you like a pamphlet and it's like here's the master plan and you can clearly see it says
[1:07:07.320 --> 1:07:12.560]  you know like says like written by dr. evil and then they just scratch out dr. evil and
[1:07:12.560 --> 1:07:16.280]  then put trump and you're just like we just like this is dark no it doesn't say trump
[1:07:16.280 --> 1:07:21.520]  but but here's stacey abrams projecting on to trump what the democrats are doing right
[1:07:21.520 --> 1:07:28.200]  now one of the most powerful weapons in our toolbox against the system is the ballot as
[1:07:28.200 --> 1:07:33.200]  the federal government works in concert with republican officials who fear what we know
[1:07:33.200 --> 1:07:38.480]  to be true the empowerment of communities of color women and young americans means the
[1:07:38.480 --> 1:07:44.120]  rejection of their politics so voter suppression is their playbook because without it there
[1:07:44.120 --> 1:07:50.560]  is no path to victory for republicans and no future for donald trump we saw their playbook
[1:07:50.560 --> 1:07:56.560]  at work this past tuesday where voters mostly black and brown americans suffered from incompetence
[1:07:56.560 --> 1:08:02.640]  and malfeasance at the hands of republican secretaries of state yeah if you don't vote
[1:08:02.640 --> 1:08:12.720]  democrat you ain't black trump and republicans are trying to have voter suppression are you
[1:08:12.720 --> 1:08:20.440]  are you stupid trump supporters and republicans have not done anything more to get people registered
[1:08:20.440 --> 1:08:25.400]  to vote i mean just the lies of this woman but again folks they're projecting what they're
[1:08:25.400 --> 1:08:34.000]  doing on to trump because they know politically they have no path to victory folks joe biden
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:38.640]  can't even fill a gym do you realize that joe binds last rally in cleveland before they
[1:08:38.640 --> 1:08:41.520]  shut everything down i believe it's like march second or something you guys can try to find
[1:08:41.520 --> 1:08:51.520]  this do you realize he had a planned rally and no one showed up no one nobody trump has
[1:08:51.520 --> 1:08:56.880]  a rally planned for tulsa oklahoma this saturday with over a million people rsvp'd online and
[1:08:56.880 --> 1:09:02.080]  that was after he kind of spit in the eye of his people and moved it from friday to saturday
[1:09:02.080 --> 1:09:10.040]  i was not happy about that but fine he did it he catered to the leftist media mob again
[1:09:10.040 --> 1:09:16.960]  a million people registered for trump rally oklahoma joe biden has a rally nobody shows
[1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:28.080]  up zero oh but oh yeah biden's leading in the polls oh yeah trump can't win a political
[1:09:28.080 --> 1:09:33.800]  victory he just beat hillary clinton the entire establishment and biden can't get 10 people
[1:09:33.800 --> 1:09:39.080]  to show up at a rally but uh yeah we got him we got trump dead to rights now but he's gonna
[1:09:39.080 --> 1:09:45.400]  cheat in the voting booth we just know it even though that's all they do it's like you know
[1:09:45.400 --> 1:09:51.400]  i mean i don't know what george floyd's political affiliation was but now that he's dead i know
[1:09:51.400 --> 1:09:59.320]  he's gonna be voting democrat for the rest of his life everybody knows that project veritas
[1:09:59.320 --> 1:10:03.840]  has caught the democrats cheating james james will keep winning and walked in and voted
[1:10:03.840 --> 1:10:09.480]  i think it's like michael jackson and denise rodman it's a joke and then oh trump's trying
[1:10:09.480 --> 1:10:14.760]  to stop this trump hasn't even been involved in politics for four whole years yet and somehow
[1:10:14.760 --> 1:10:27.600]  everything that's wrong with the system is trumps fault of course we know that's bs but
[1:10:27.600 --> 1:10:38.360]  again people are wondering what the president is doing i don't have any answers folks believe
[1:10:38.360 --> 1:10:45.560]  me i'm just as angsty about president trump right now as anybody else i don't think it's
[1:10:45.560 --> 1:10:53.680]  time to be anti trump i think it's just time to be pro god pro america pro truth pro justice
[1:10:53.680 --> 1:10:59.600]  and let trump decide his own fate and own destiny because at the end of the day whoever
[1:10:59.600 --> 1:11:03.400]  the president is the left is going to come to your front door and force you to take a
[1:11:03.400 --> 1:11:09.160]  vaccine hand over your gun hand over your medical records hand over all of your freedom
[1:11:09.160 --> 1:11:15.400]  and and that's ultimately when you're going to have to decide and it's not going to be
[1:11:15.400 --> 1:11:23.520]  these leftists out here in the street it's not going to be the police it'll be mob squads
[1:11:23.520 --> 1:11:29.160]  with the un or literal democrat operatives inside the fbi or law enforcement somehow
[1:11:29.160 --> 1:11:32.680]  that's going to go to your front door and tell you to turn in your guns or take a covid
[1:11:32.680 --> 1:11:41.080]  test or take a vaccine or whatever and it's just sick but hey they've they've spent their
[1:11:41.080 --> 1:11:46.800]  wad they've they've exposed themselves promoting all the writing and everything and then telling
[1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:51.360]  you you can't own a business politically the democrats are dead folks they know it nobody
[1:11:51.360 --> 1:11:59.960]  wants to vote for a democrat right now except the lowest iq people out there
[1:11:59.960 --> 1:12:04.400]  but hey you know when you're told you're not black unless you vote democrat well i i guess
[1:12:04.400 --> 1:12:09.600]  you can't think for yourself after all anyway can you you're going to let all whitey joe
[1:12:09.600 --> 1:12:16.400]  all whitey joe biden who calls black kids cockroaches walks around sniffing and molesting children
[1:12:16.400 --> 1:12:23.400]  on live camera you're gonna let him decide if you're black that's what you're gonna do
[1:12:23.400 --> 1:12:27.440]  because you're so smart you figured the whole thing out didn't you you figured the whole
[1:12:27.440 --> 1:12:31.400]  thing out it's trump that's out to get you the guy that's been in office for four years
[1:12:31.400 --> 1:12:35.600]  not biden who's been in office for 40 or feinstein who's been in office for 70 or polosi who's
[1:12:35.600 --> 1:12:42.160]  been in office for 50 no not all the democrats no it's it's trump that had record low unemployment
[1:12:42.160 --> 1:12:46.400]  including in the black community it's trump it's out to get you not all these damn democrats
[1:12:46.400 --> 1:12:51.280]  that have been put in jail for 50 years it's trump you guys figured it out yep the democrat
[1:12:51.280 --> 1:12:55.960]  voters you guys really figured out your geniuses the united states is not communist china we
[1:12:55.960 --> 1:13:01.400]  don't have three million people in concentration camps we don't blow up churches we don't kill
[1:13:01.400 --> 1:13:06.480]  political dissidents that sell their organs but all of the news we see the un available
[1:13:06.480 --> 1:13:13.160]  indicates w.h.o. mainstream corporate media praising communist china for their response
[1:13:13.160 --> 1:13:17.520]  and if communist china shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has
[1:13:17.520 --> 1:13:22.160]  robots controlling people well then gee we've got to do that and on top of it cities like
[1:13:22.160 --> 1:13:27.240]  san Antonio pass laws saying will arrest you if you say chinese virus well now qualmo
[1:13:27.240 --> 1:13:32.680]  in new york's calling it the european virus these people are out of control control freaks
[1:13:32.680 --> 1:13:36.880]  and they are going to lose big time because we the people are aware of their criminal
[1:13:36.880 --> 1:13:41.840]  activities and are exposing them in their power grab the resistance lives at bandot
[1:13:41.840 --> 1:13:47.200]  video and in full wars dot com spread those links and jam it down the censors throats
[1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:54.480]  and then we'll be able to defeat their operation that much quicker aerodyne technology delivery
[1:13:54.480 --> 1:14:01.320]  system the first of its kind pure nascent atomic iodine that can be delivered through
[1:14:01.320 --> 1:14:07.040]  a spray bottle the next level of innovation of x2 is here introducing survival shield
[1:14:07.040 --> 1:14:12.480]  x2 spray the great part about the x2 spray is it's great on the go we've got it in the
[1:14:12.480 --> 1:14:17.200]  dropper it's great at your house it's great at work but this is great for the car it's
[1:14:17.200 --> 1:14:22.600]  great to keep with you and again it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects
[1:14:22.600 --> 1:14:27.800]  of iodine not to just ingest it into the stomach we're really excited about it it's 33% off
[1:14:27.800 --> 1:14:32.680]  out of the gates it was listeners idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that
[1:14:32.680 --> 1:14:36.640]  had us talk to the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes
[1:14:36.640 --> 1:14:41.480]  it and delivers it to the body in a new and in some ways even better way get your survival
[1:14:41.480 --> 1:14:47.560]  shield x2 nascent iodine spray now at 33% off at info wars store dot com and experience
[1:14:47.560 --> 1:14:56.240]  the power of aerosolized x2 nascent iodine for yourself you're listening to the alex
[1:14:56.240 --> 1:15:19.160]  jones show ladies and gentlemen it's now my mission and we have to consciously i have
[1:15:19.160 --> 1:15:25.880]  to consciously get in my own head and train myself here and shift the gears around but
[1:15:25.880 --> 1:15:30.320]  the mission of exposing the fake news exposing the globalist exposing the democrat plans
[1:15:30.320 --> 1:15:35.560]  exposing bill gates and all this other stuff that mission is complete folks there's really
[1:15:35.560 --> 1:15:41.640]  not much more we can do in that mission and and and we've put out so many different satellites
[1:15:41.640 --> 1:15:46.640]  and beacons of this information that it's it's already so prevalent out there most people
[1:15:46.640 --> 1:15:49.800]  that are getting awoke to all of this and retweeting it and sharing it doing videos
[1:15:49.800 --> 1:15:55.440]  they don't even realize we're the original source so so to me that's the sign of okay
[1:15:55.440 --> 1:16:02.800]  time to change tack and think about what we need to do operationally to seize victory
[1:16:02.800 --> 1:16:07.560]  from the jaws of defeat here and there's a lot of different questions and measurements

[1:16:34.480 --> 1:16:39.440]  that way fearing he would lose the election but that's that i measured that not a path
[1:16:39.440 --> 1:16:45.320]  to victory the path to victory is just tell people because we still need trump like the
[1:16:45.320 --> 1:16:54.280]  bulls need jordan we still need trump to take that buzzer beating shot but people just need

[1:20:57.440 --> 1:21:01.040]  social distancing orders if you can believe that while they allow people to riot and burn
[1:21:01.040 --> 1:21:06.720]  down buildings right and so she's out here just preach the word of god and basically

[1:21:38.800 --> 1:21:42.360]  little bit crazier here in a little bit and we'll let you guys know um we're just outside
[1:21:42.360 --> 1:21:48.720]  of the border of this new country by the way yeah they have a wall by the way I know but
[1:21:48.720 --> 1:21:53.240]  I want my own autonomous zone okay yeah that's the thing I want my own I want a constitutional
[1:21:53.240 --> 1:21:59.280]  autonomous zone yeah I mean I guess the constitution doesn't apply in the nation of chop or their
[1:21:59.280 --> 1:22:04.920]  own logic because they have walls and it's the most racist nation I've ever heard of
[1:22:04.920 --> 1:22:11.120]  they literally have signs for segregation yeah um so the guy that I saw yesterday you're
[1:22:11.120 --> 1:22:16.800]  playing the video of the preacher who uh got choked out um by louise and sexually assaulted
[1:22:16.800 --> 1:22:23.720]  they do you see that yeah I did see that disgusting you can't make this stuff up um so but they're
[1:22:23.720 --> 1:22:27.120]  saying he was saying I'm a sovereign citizen or whatever he was saying and they're like
[1:22:27.120 --> 1:22:31.960]  well we get to pick who stays in here so they're like deporting people out of their country
[1:22:31.960 --> 1:22:38.480]  yeah they got their own like organic ice now yeah they do and look it's all white people
[1:22:38.480 --> 1:22:44.640]  yeah yeah yeah I mean this is insane I'm looking at a video of all white people hating each
[1:22:44.640 --> 1:22:50.520]  other in the name of black people right how did we get here Joey well they're taking advantage
[1:22:50.520 --> 1:22:53.960]  of black people they're they're taking advantage of black people for their own communist agenda
[1:22:53.960 --> 1:22:59.160]  I mean you know I really wish that the black community would begin to wake up and understand
[1:22:59.160 --> 1:23:02.800]  listen if you don't like your community if you're upset at your community if you're upset
[1:23:02.800 --> 1:23:06.520]  about the policing in your community did you do you know that you keep voting democrats
[1:23:06.520 --> 1:23:10.840]  in every single time I mean these democrats are running these cities every single city
[1:23:10.840 --> 1:23:15.560]  right every single major city um and so I really wish there'd be some sort of awakening you
[1:23:15.560 --> 1:23:20.360]  know obviously Candace Owen is doing a lot to try to push that um but we'll see what
[1:23:20.360 --> 1:23:24.480]  happens this year but see you know that's the weird thing Joey is that it's never going
[1:23:24.480 --> 1:23:28.000]  to be a Candace Owens or someone that wakes these people up because it's always got to
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:32.360]  be somehow of their own volition if they have any left but maybe that's it maybe that's
[1:23:32.360 --> 1:23:36.480]  it they realize wait a second every city that we're complaining about is run by democrats
[1:23:36.480 --> 1:23:41.080]  at every level the governor the mayor the city council the local boards everything it's
[1:23:41.080 --> 1:23:46.480]  all democrats so maybe it's like if somehow they realize it I mean the democrats are already
[1:23:46.480 --> 1:23:51.040]  done but that's like an eternal death blow we'll be right back hey guys rob do here with

[1:27:49.480 --> 1:27:59.120]  head to figure out what our next role in this is our role in 2016 and 2015 was to get trump
[1:27:59.120 --> 1:28:03.840]  over the hump of the establishment stopping him from getting the republican nomination
[1:28:03.840 --> 1:28:12.480]  we were successful in that endeavor then it was propping up the reality of who trump is
[1:28:12.480 --> 1:28:17.960]  versus the lies of the mainstream news folks the mainstream news is so evil in this country
[1:28:17.960 --> 1:28:26.000]  i i i really just i can't even explain it it's either you see it or you don't but so
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:30.480]  i feel like all that role has already passed we've informed america we've got trump in it's
[1:28:30.480 --> 1:28:34.840]  like we've fulfilled that destiny we've fulfilled that role what is our now what what is our
[1:28:34.840 --> 1:28:41.120]  role now it's to tell you folks it's time to get battle hardened and realize that you're
[1:28:41.120 --> 1:28:46.280]  in a wartime right now and there are evil forces out to destroy this country they've

[1:29:13.680 --> 1:29:17.920]  com or getting the water filters or getting guns and ammunition whatever that means for
[1:29:17.920 --> 1:29:22.800]  you folks getting on your knees praying for god forgiveness or or blessings whatever that

[1:32:13.520 --> 1:32:19.720]  and then it gets to the trump rally and it sends out its beacon and it's like oh we've
[1:32:19.720 --> 1:32:24.280]  got some america loving god fearing patriots out here it's time to spread time to activate
[1:32:24.280 --> 1:32:33.320]  right i mean that right that's that report was from cnn right no what's good for the
[1:32:33.320 --> 1:32:40.720]  goose is not good for the gander report luhan lab took delivery of world's deadliest viruses
[1:32:40.720 --> 1:32:46.080]  months prior to coronavirus outbreak so so basically folks this lab in luhan is the bio
[1:32:46.080 --> 1:32:51.800]  weapons research lab that bill gates and fouchier running sit we found it so all their bio weapons
[1:32:51.800 --> 1:32:58.320]  come out of that lab you just got a little taste of one china reports 57 new coronavirus
[1:32:58.320 --> 1:33:03.840]  cases amid beijing outbreak china locks down 10 more beijing neighborhoods over cove at
[1:33:03.840 --> 1:33:12.120]  19 outbreak strain in beijing cove at 19 outbreak not like the type circulating in china cdc
[1:33:12.120 --> 1:33:21.960]  chief epi demiologist china shuts vast beijing market as it hunts coronavirus cluster so
[1:33:21.960 --> 1:33:28.040]  they're building it up for round two ladies and gentlemen building it up building it up
[1:33:28.040 --> 1:33:33.600]  hyping it up maybe it's a new one maybe they just released a new one getting ready to spread
[1:33:33.600 --> 1:33:41.000]  that somehow but you know why not just also use this opportunity to kill women's femininity
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:50.360]  as well shorter hairstyles will help stop the spread of coven ah yes yes yes chop your
[1:33:50.360 --> 1:33:57.320]  head off ladies just like bald for blm because it's all about taking away the power of femininity
[1:33:57.320 --> 1:34:02.040]  from women so if you're a woman and you lose your power of femininity you have nothing
[1:34:02.040 --> 1:34:08.560]  left they want you to chop your breasts off they want you to not be with a man they want
[1:34:08.560 --> 1:34:17.000]  you to not be feminine then what are you well you're a product of the system you're a slave
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:21.920]  to the system it's like a male that hates being masculine that thinks masculinity is a problem
[1:34:21.920 --> 1:34:27.560]  so they cut themselves and they dress like women and then they even become women well
[1:34:27.560 --> 1:34:34.160]  what are you really you're a product of your corrupt environment but look at this murderer
[1:34:34.160 --> 1:34:38.880]  Andrew Cuomo yes Andrew Cuomo is a mass murderer by the way you didn't hear it on CNN but it's
[1:34:38.880 --> 1:34:45.720]  true mass murderer Andrew Cuomo threatens to reverse reopening in Manhattan Hamptons
[1:34:45.720 --> 1:34:51.640]  amid rampant coronavirus social distancing violations oh but nothing about the Brooklyn
[1:34:51.640 --> 1:34:57.000]  protests that had thousands of people shoulder to shoulder no no no no no that's no problem
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:35:02.960]  for mass murderer Cuomo and you know I'm not going to sit here and get mad but this is
[1:35:02.960 --> 1:35:12.080]  a damp joke Andrew Cuomo is a mass murderer mass murderer Andrew Cuomo Andrew Cuomo is
[1:35:12.080 --> 1:35:18.160]  murdered more people than Jeffrey Dahmer now Cuomo doesn't bend them up backwards and sideways
[1:35:18.160 --> 1:35:23.000]  and turn them into some weird freak art piece like the Podestas but Cuomo sends the COVID
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:33.080]  into the nursing homes and thousands die and then they cover it up oh yeah oh we know about
[1:35:33.080 --> 1:35:41.880]  you Cuomo oh boy you know I'm just gonna stop right there but when the state of New York
[1:35:41.880 --> 1:35:46.640]  is aligned against you here at Info Wars boy they are really scared of this broadcast and
[1:35:46.640 --> 1:35:54.400]  I'll just leave it at that grim blame game over virus deaths in besieged nursing homes
[1:35:54.400 --> 1:35:59.480]  yeah because everyone knows it's Cuomo's fault but you see now the hospitals and the nurses
[1:35:59.480 --> 1:36:05.360]  and the doctors are gonna get the blame and they're all gonna point right at Cuomo Cuomo
[1:36:05.360 --> 1:36:10.520]  you made us put him on the ventilators Cuomo you made us put the infected patients into
[1:36:10.520 --> 1:36:20.800]  nursing homes Andrew Cuomo is a mass murderer the fact that murdering psychopath isn't in
[1:36:20.800 --> 1:36:28.440]  jail is a direct threat to everyone in the state of New York but hey Anthony Fauci says
[1:36:28.440 --> 1:36:33.880]  don't count on the summer reopening we've got COVID round two coming I'm Anthony Fauci
[1:36:33.880 --> 1:36:38.560]  I helped run a bio research lab in Wuhan China that this virus came out of killing millions
[1:36:38.560 --> 1:36:42.400]  of people and I'm proud of it and now I'm gonna kill the economy with it because I'm
[1:36:42.400 --> 1:36:49.320]  a sick psychopath freak and me and Bill Gates and and Cuomo gonna murder you the people
[1:36:49.320 --> 1:36:55.080]  of the world have awakened to globalism and so populist movements are throwing the globalist
[1:36:55.080 --> 1:37:00.840]  out of their countries that's why the New World Order is instituting race war and division
[1:37:00.840 --> 1:37:06.720]  and telling the people that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government
[1:37:06.720 --> 1:37:13.240]  and destroying essential services this is an attempt to have society collapse and the
[1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:17.640]  globalists as they've done in the third world will come in and pick up the pieces you must
[1:37:17.640 --> 1:37:23.920]  stand against the UN the IMF the World Bank and the EU openly saying the fund the police

[1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:41.000]  the globalists believe communist China is the model of the world and they are orchestrating
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:45.720]  this entire thing the people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must

[1:41:29.160 --> 1:41:35.560]  eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine eight seven seven seven eight
[1:41:35.560 --> 1:41:44.480]  nine two five three nine or eight seven seven seven eight nine alex Ted Cruz is in a bit
[1:41:44.480 --> 1:41:53.800]  of a spat with the Hollywood hater Ron Perlman right now and Ted bet Ron Perlman ten grand
[1:41:53.800 --> 1:41:59.560]  that he couldn't beat Jim Jordan in the ring we're still waiting to see if Perlman will
[1:41:59.560 --> 1:42:11.400]  accept that invitation but don't hold your breath I've also got some other news here
[1:42:11.400 --> 1:42:21.160]  this is incredible massive bribe to stop Ukraine probe of barisma founder intercepted six million
[1:42:21.160 --> 1:42:27.960]  dollars intercepted this weekend by Ukrainian officials us cash let me repeat that one more
[1:42:27.960 --> 1:42:39.480]  time six million us cash six million us cash Ukraine's anti-corruption prosecutor nazar
[1:42:39.480 --> 1:42:45.640]  coladitsky said former vice president joe biden's sons joe biden's son hunter who once
[1:42:45.640 --> 1:42:52.920]  held a board seat was not complicit in the bribe attempt so here's what's going on
[1:42:54.120 --> 1:43:01.480]  last week the Pentagon released 250 million dollars to Ukraine for foreign aid
[1:43:04.600 --> 1:43:12.600]  Ukraine is actually trying to get to the bottom of this biden corruption it runs deep millions
[1:43:12.600 --> 1:43:19.800]  of dollars so who knows where the six million in cash really derived and was really paying it off
[1:43:19.800 --> 1:43:25.080]  but would you really be surprised if it wasn't joe biden himself or hunter biden himself who can't
[1:43:25.080 --> 1:43:31.560]  even afford for his child care payments allegedly but was making millions of dollars illegally in
[1:43:31.560 --> 1:43:44.440]  Ukraine six million us cash intercepted a bribe to stop Ukraine probe of barisma founder and again
[1:43:44.440 --> 1:43:49.080]  this is the company that the bides are all tied up in in criminal behavior up to their eyeballs
[1:43:51.480 --> 1:43:55.560]  so we'll see if biden ever goes to jail for his treason
[1:43:55.560 --> 1:44:05.080]  54 scientists have lost their jobs as a result of nih probe into foreign ties 93
[1:44:06.840 --> 1:44:13.480]  so it's about 50 of the 54 scientists had hidden funding coming in from china
[1:44:13.480 --> 1:44:29.880]  wow wow just a little hint where a lot of the money is coming from a lot of the power is coming
[1:44:29.880 --> 1:44:41.480]  from china so china leverages its economy of three billion people china leverages its slave labor
[1:44:41.480 --> 1:44:53.000]  to attract industry and manufacturing china leverages its fixed economy that just prints cash
[1:44:53.800 --> 1:45:01.400]  to bribe people to come in get involved and stay silent and they spread it all throughout the world
[1:45:01.400 --> 1:45:12.920]  to cover it up that's why you don't hear about the wuhan lab that released the biological material
[1:45:12.920 --> 1:45:19.400]  you don't hear about charles leber with harvard smuggling biological material to china you don't
[1:45:19.400 --> 1:45:24.280]  hear about bill gates and anti-anthony fauci's ties to the wuhan lab you don't hear about barack
[1:45:24.280 --> 1:45:31.800]  obama who had to shut down the lab in north carolina in 2014 selling that biological material to
[1:45:31.800 --> 1:45:43.560]  china these are all acts of war now again this is the point in my head where i look at the president
[1:45:43.560 --> 1:45:52.840]  in the united states and i think what are you doing you're tweeting a lot but uh joe biden
[1:45:52.840 --> 1:45:58.200]  committed open treason he's running for president against you barack obama committed open treason
[1:45:58.200 --> 1:46:04.920]  he's out there running black lives matter behind the scenes known terror groups have taken over
[1:46:04.920 --> 1:46:09.400]  seattle funded by black lives matter and other such people that all can trace back to george
[1:46:09.400 --> 1:46:16.040]  soros he's still operating but you the american citizen want to have a funeral for your granny
[1:46:16.040 --> 1:46:21.240]  no you the american citizen want to open up your business to full capacity no you the american
[1:46:21.240 --> 1:46:25.480]  citizen want to go to a concert no you the american citizen want to go to a ballgame
[1:46:26.040 --> 1:46:32.920]  no and here's the worst news if we go along with all this now
[1:46:35.480 --> 1:46:39.800]  i mean they'll eventually reopen everything but you're going to be a total slave at that point
[1:46:41.240 --> 1:46:45.320]  and so it'll be oh i'm so desperate to go to the concert of the ballgame
[1:46:45.320 --> 1:46:49.800]  yep i'll give you five dollars to black lives matter yep i'll take the vaccine and and and
[1:46:49.800 --> 1:46:53.800]  take the insert or take the chip whatever i gotta do just let me out of my house let me
[1:46:53.800 --> 1:46:59.320]  have a funeral let me run a business let me go to a ballgame and america will buy it folks
[1:47:00.920 --> 1:47:09.160]  unless they know what it is unless they know it is evil unless they know it is a lie unless
[1:47:09.160 --> 1:47:13.080]  they know it is the first shackle in the chains that will enslave them
[1:47:13.080 --> 1:47:20.760]  but america does know now and it'll be interesting to see when this finally goes down
[1:47:22.120 --> 1:47:28.040]  what the new economy will look like because hollywood has no support left they just have
[1:47:28.040 --> 1:47:35.160]  chinese funding and all of these sports leagues that were still kind of clinging to their popularity
[1:47:35.160 --> 1:47:45.400]  i'm done with them i can't even see anything nba basketball related without vomiting getting
[1:47:45.400 --> 1:47:50.840]  lectured by lebron james about how i'm bad because i'm white this guy probably has 10 houses and
[1:47:50.840 --> 1:47:57.560]  boats hundreds of millions of dollars sits here and tells me hey inaction against inequality
[1:47:57.560 --> 1:48:05.880]  is bad anywhere ignores the slave labor in china that makes all of his shoes and equipment
[1:48:05.880 --> 1:48:06.920]  you lebron james
[1:48:09.560 --> 1:48:14.040]  same with the nfl oh they're all planning on taking a knee
[1:48:15.640 --> 1:48:21.800]  mm-hmm all run by china china started it folks oh yeah let me tell you let me give you a little
[1:48:21.800 --> 1:48:24.840]  hint here let me give you a little behind the scenes fly on the wall action
[1:48:24.840 --> 1:48:32.600]  colin cavernick was in a contract year his career as an nfl quarterback was over
[1:48:33.160 --> 1:48:36.760]  he knew that teams were already trying him out as as in different positions
[1:48:37.960 --> 1:48:41.320]  he knew his career as a quarterback was over he was a system quarterback
[1:48:42.440 --> 1:48:48.760]  and hell good quarterbacks come and go that can actually throw the football well and sustain success
[1:48:48.760 --> 1:48:57.080]  and he knew that and he had one year left with his contract with the 49ers i think it was like
[1:48:57.640 --> 1:49:01.000]  six million dollars or so i don't know that number maybe the crew can find it point is
[1:49:02.200 --> 1:49:07.720]  quarterback contract year knows these probably at the end of his nfl career probably the last
[1:49:07.720 --> 1:49:16.280]  contract he'll ever get uh if he didn't sign an extension but he decided to not sign the
[1:49:16.280 --> 1:49:22.040]  extension and actually walked out of his contract so this is a very oppressed black man that walks
[1:49:22.040 --> 1:49:28.840]  away from six million dollars i mean must be tough must be tough to be so oppressed you walk away
[1:49:28.840 --> 1:49:37.160]  from six million dollars oh but see that six million dollars was chump change compared to
[1:49:37.160 --> 1:49:44.200]  what china was offering him through nike and so colin cavernick made the measurement or it was made
[1:49:44.200 --> 1:49:50.920]  for him said well i can make six million dollars and one more year in the nfl and that would pretty
[1:49:50.920 --> 1:49:59.400]  much be the end of me and my career he knew it or he could walk away from that six million dollars
[1:50:00.040 --> 1:50:07.880]  and sign a 10 million or even 50 million dollar deal with nike but all you would have to do is
[1:50:07.880 --> 1:50:14.760]  take a knee and start a racial division race riot movement in this country against white people
[1:50:14.760 --> 1:50:20.520]  and against police and he did his measurement he said hmm well i'm done as a quarterback i've got
[1:50:20.520 --> 1:50:27.080]  six million on the table that's nice but what happens to me after that not so sure well if i
[1:50:27.080 --> 1:50:32.600]  walk out of this contract and i take a knee and i do this whole social upheaval and and lie about
[1:50:32.600 --> 1:50:40.440]  civil riots and lie about race relations i can get 50 million plus from nike and be famous okay
[1:50:41.800 --> 1:50:47.480]  okay i'll do that then i wasn't gonna play much football anyway so i'll walk away from the six
[1:50:47.480 --> 1:50:52.120]  million i'll take my 50 million from china and nike and i'll start race riots in this country
[1:50:52.120 --> 1:50:56.920]  against police and white people boom that's colin cavernick and the media tells you he
[1:50:56.920 --> 1:51:06.920]  sacrificed it all a total lie america's so racist that colin cavernick a black man gets
[1:51:06.920 --> 1:51:13.560]  adopted by two white people becomes rich and powerful beyond any of our wildest imagination
[1:51:13.560 --> 1:51:18.680]  and then tells you how oppressed he is as he leaves millions of dollars on the table and then america
[1:51:18.680 --> 1:51:24.280]  burns to the ground and everybody takes a knee because he made it popular and it all came out
[1:51:24.280 --> 1:51:31.720]  of china and it all came out of nike it's all an attack against america folks and you have to

[1:54:10.680 --> 1:54:15.240]  unchecked moment for every time it was easier to ignore than to call it out for what it was
[1:54:15.960 --> 1:54:23.640]  every not-so-funny joke every unfair stereotype they are attempting to completely destabilize the
[1:54:23.640 --> 1:54:30.760]  economy destroy confidence so that we will absolutely abandon the make america great again
[1:54:30.760 --> 1:54:37.000]  and system like i feel like the bottom has to fall out at some point and by the way i'm hoping
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:42.280]  for it because i think one way you get rid of trump is a crashing economy so please bring on the
[1:54:42.280 --> 1:54:47.240]  recession sorry if that hurts people but it's either root for a recession or you lose your
[1:54:47.240 --> 1:54:53.720]  democracy we are going into absolute total bondage if you like what the democrats have done
[1:54:54.360 --> 1:54:58.600]  in black areas of the country dumbing people down enslaving them getting them into debt putting
[1:54:58.600 --> 1:55:02.200]  them on welfare aborting them well you're really going to love it because it's going to happen to
[1:55:02.200 --> 1:55:09.880]  everybody this is a planetary complete and total takeover and you see this illustrated by the fact
[1:55:09.880 --> 1:55:16.680]  that all over the world governments are endorsing black lives matter as if there's again some attack
[1:55:16.680 --> 1:55:22.520]  on black people by the general public in the west when in truth it's the un and the globalist
[1:55:22.520 --> 1:55:27.720]  that are absolutely targeting africans particularly for depopulation and that's the state
[1:55:27.720 --> 1:55:33.240]  department random 200 with henry kissinger and has been part of u.s policy until now and trump
[1:55:33.240 --> 1:55:37.800]  has pulled us out of unesco and pulled us out of these agreements that's actually been stopping
[1:55:37.800 --> 1:55:42.920]  this and that's why they're so angry at him again saying that he's the big evil horrible racist it
[1:55:42.920 --> 1:55:50.440]  is complete upside down world the united nations has engineered the covid collapse it's caused a
[1:55:50.440 --> 1:55:55.000]  worldwide depression it is far worse the third world than it is in the first world but we're
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:56:01.080]  starting to see the effects here and the government stimulus money isn't going to rebuild the economy
[1:56:01.080 --> 1:56:07.000]  if the economy isn't completely turned back on quickly and the third world will accelerate
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:15.880]  into total bedlam and mass waves will then surge at europe and the united states of tens of millions
[1:56:15.880 --> 1:56:21.960]  not just the millions we've already seen now that is officially in united nations reports
[1:56:21.960 --> 1:56:26.280]  law and order is starting to break down and more and more good people don't want to be police
[1:56:26.280 --> 1:56:31.240]  officers because they know nobody's going to back them up and they're charged with going out and
[1:56:31.240 --> 1:56:36.760]  enforcing the law that is the law and then when things don't go right they get the blame now if
[1:56:36.760 --> 1:56:41.320]  i was a police officer somebody jerked my taser away and was going for my gun or whatever i don't
[1:56:41.320 --> 1:56:45.240]  know what i'd do and it's still not clear exactly from the dash cam footage exactly what happened
[1:56:45.240 --> 1:56:51.240]  but it was a serious fight and they were trying to execute the law in the state of georgia in the
[1:56:51.240 --> 1:56:56.120]  city of atlanta and it's wendy's that called the police on him because he was reportedly
[1:56:56.760 --> 1:57:03.320]  passed out there at the window white people per capita are twice as likely not just per
[1:57:03.320 --> 1:57:08.600]  population per capita to be shot and killed by police officers because they don't hesitate
[1:57:08.600 --> 1:57:12.280]  with white people because they know there's not the political correctness and in most cases the
[1:57:12.280 --> 1:57:19.400]  police are in the right because they're out there trying to control a country that uses more drugs
[1:57:19.400 --> 1:57:26.520]  than any other nation on earth some metrics show that the united states uses 10 times more
[1:57:26.520 --> 1:57:32.360]  illegal drugs than the next nation that is known for using a high amount of illegal drugs we are
[1:57:32.360 --> 1:57:38.600]  satanic we've aborted 62 million babies people are bombed out of their brains on average and
[1:57:39.160 --> 1:57:43.560]  everybody wishing for the total abolition of police it's never going to happen you're going to get a
[1:57:43.560 --> 1:57:48.840]  collapse and then you're going to get a serious fascist police state in this country that'll call
[1:57:48.840 --> 1:57:52.360]  itself communist that's how it always works so if you really don't want electricity and you really
[1:57:52.360 --> 1:57:55.960]  don't want medicine and you really don't want food you're going to end up getting it
[1:57:59.560 --> 1:58:02.360]  all right ladies and gentlemen we're going to be hearing again from alex jones before the
[1:58:02.360 --> 1:58:08.280]  conclusion of this hour here uh but when we come back i'm going to go right to your phone lines

[1:58:30.760 --> 1:58:39.800]  democrats happening every day makes me sick and now our conservative judges are sitting
[1:58:39.800 --> 1:58:46.040]  on the supreme court talking about weewees and peepies and and trannies that's as pathetic

[2:00:16.200 --> 2:00:21.240]  and again i i'm not anti trump i'm not trying to bash trump folks but i just tell it like it is
[2:00:21.240 --> 2:00:27.480]  and trump looks like a very weak leader right now now he can turn it all around and we need him to
[2:00:27.480 --> 2:00:35.880]  and we need him to take the buzzer beating shot and hit the game winning shot for america but
[2:00:35.880 --> 2:00:40.520]  just don't don't don't kid yourself because you're in a cult trump a trump call
[2:00:42.760 --> 2:00:46.360]  don't don't kid yourself you need to be real about the situation
[2:00:48.040 --> 2:00:52.280]  now i'll just leave it at that and i'm not even saying trump should do anything about
[2:00:52.280 --> 2:00:59.080]  chaser chop that's not i'm saying he can he can cure all these ills by going after the names
[2:00:59.080 --> 2:01:03.640]  and the faces that we know have committed open treason against this country like biden obama
[2:01:03.640 --> 2:01:09.400]  brennan combi clinton and the like why those people aren't behind bars
[2:01:11.480 --> 2:01:17.000]  sipping cocktails with the devil satan and hell beyond me
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:26.680]  now let's go to your phone calls here on the alex joneshow and let's start with joe in arkansas
[2:01:26.680 --> 2:01:32.040]  go ahead joe thanks for calling in okay thank you i would like to say exactly what i think
[2:01:32.040 --> 2:01:37.480]  president trump should do about the communist insurrection that's going on right now that
[2:01:37.480 --> 2:01:43.000]  we can all sense can see and that's this okay the constitution says that one of the jobs of the
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:48.120]  militia is to put down insurrections and the state laws generally define the militia basically is
[2:01:48.120 --> 2:01:54.040]  all the patriotic citizens and the constitution says that the president is commander in chief
[2:01:54.040 --> 2:02:00.040]  of the militia so i think president trump should appoint alex jones as national captain of the
[2:02:00.040 --> 2:02:06.280]  militia and authorize him to work with all the patriotic military police and patriotic citizens
[2:02:06.280 --> 2:02:11.720]  who want to volunteer to do whatever is necessary to put down this communist insurrection and make
[2:02:11.720 --> 2:02:16.040]  sure it doesn't happen again for a long long time that's what i think president trump should do right
[2:02:16.040 --> 2:02:20.520]  now well if the president was going to do that he'd have to fire about 30 people inside of his
[2:02:20.520 --> 2:02:25.640]  administration first that are going to stop him from doing any of that so like i'll tell you this
[2:02:26.200 --> 2:02:31.240]  uh president trump is going to be on with michael savage today do you realize that almost his
[2:02:31.240 --> 2:02:37.000]  entire administration tried to stop that from happening he has enemies in his administration
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:43.720]  i mean it it's a joke i i i i don't get it man like brad parscale
[2:02:45.320 --> 2:02:50.840]  what the hell is brad parscale doing hey we know about social media censorship but i'm still on
[2:02:50.840 --> 2:02:56.600]  here hey hey brad parscale what do you think about the censorship of inforce and alex jones
[2:02:56.600 --> 2:03:00.440]  who is that i've never heard of him brad parscale needs to go
[2:03:00.440 --> 2:03:08.840]  so joe look it's a pipe dream maybe trump would do it but he's got about 30 people in his way
[2:03:08.840 --> 2:03:12.680]  stopping him from doing anything serious unfortunately thanks for the call sue in
[2:03:12.680 --> 2:03:19.000]  kansas go ahead you're on the alex jones show hi ellen thanks for all you do i just wanted
[2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:26.600]  to say to your question earlier about why they are allowing all of the black people the riot in
[2:03:26.600 --> 2:03:32.040]  the streets but then they're worried about the covet when it comes to the trump rally now you
[2:03:32.040 --> 2:03:37.480]  know the answer just like i know the answer because they know that black people are dying
[2:03:37.480 --> 2:03:43.400]  disproportionately of the covet even here in wichita when you look at the disproportionality
[2:03:43.400 --> 2:03:50.360]  it's unbelievable how many of the few people that have died have been black now i hold on a
[2:03:50.360 --> 2:03:54.280]  second hold on a second because i want to i'm not sure if you're being sarcastic because
[2:03:54.280 --> 2:03:59.880]  they really literally claim that covet affects minorities worse than anywhere else they've made
[2:03:59.880 --> 2:04:04.840]  this claim in almost every major city so i don't know if you're being facetious when you say oh
[2:04:04.840 --> 2:04:11.240]  that's why they're allowed to go out or not uh but it is odd again like they claim oh you can't go
[2:04:11.240 --> 2:04:16.040]  out or any of this stuff because of covet but then they never say a damn word about these protests
[2:04:16.040 --> 2:04:21.720]  whether it's black people or not is really irrelevant but they do claim all minorities
[2:04:21.720 --> 2:04:25.560]  are affected by this well why aren't they telling them to stay home why aren't they telling them not
[2:04:25.560 --> 2:04:33.960]  to go protest well i'm not being facetious or sarcastic i'm i'm really meaning this i'm looking
[2:04:33.960 --> 2:04:41.880]  at the dashboard for sedgwick county kansas we've had 25 deaths and i mean it's unbelievable
[2:04:42.760 --> 2:04:50.520]  what it's showing me on these bars you've got you know three times more black people than anybody
[2:04:50.520 --> 2:04:56.440]  else are the demographics well you know that makes me wonder if bill gates or or the chinese lab
[2:04:56.440 --> 2:05:02.120]  didn't design this thing to kill black people specifically then well considering all the other
[2:05:02.120 --> 2:05:07.480]  things they've been doing since world war two been particular in the in the you know the age of
[2:05:07.480 --> 2:05:12.760]  science i mean that's what i'm saying it's like they're gonna sit here and they point black americans
[2:05:12.760 --> 2:05:19.320]  at trump or or at police or at white people and it's like hey literally bill gates is testing
[2:05:19.320 --> 2:05:26.200]  vaccines that are murdering africans it's just it's such a joke sue well it's breaking my heart
[2:05:26.200 --> 2:05:34.120]  because as a christian you know i it's really been heavy on me about the Planned Parenthood thing
[2:05:34.120 --> 2:05:39.480]  you know watching the implosion of the inner city all the things they've done okay there's bill
[2:05:39.480 --> 2:05:44.520]  gates in the middle of a mass murder i'm sorry we just pulled it up on screen go ahead well yeah i
[2:05:44.520 --> 2:05:49.640]  mean i've watched it all of my life uh from the time i was in high school and and had a clue
[2:05:50.280 --> 2:05:56.680]  what they've been doing to the black communities and it's just unfathomable that people can't see
[2:05:56.680 --> 2:06:02.280]  what's going on no and you know and that's the thing too if there was a black leader out there
[2:06:02.280 --> 2:06:06.760]  that actually wanted to inform the the black community on this stuff see they don't get it
[2:06:06.760 --> 2:06:11.320]  they get the deray mckessons and the treak the seeds who just hate white people and so that's their
[2:06:11.320 --> 2:06:16.440]  modus operandi but yeah it's like hey they tested the government u.s. governments tested multiple
[2:06:16.440 --> 2:06:22.120]  times uh vaccines and stuff on black people look at the tuskegee experiment look at st louis in the
[2:06:22.120 --> 2:06:30.120]  60s oh nobody talks about that hey the cia gave you jz to turn black culture from louis armstrong
[2:06:30.120 --> 2:06:37.880]  and eritha franklin into um lizzo and jz and they think they make you think it's gangster
[2:06:37.880 --> 2:06:42.440]  to wear your pants below your waist when that just says hey i'm gay rape me in the butt
[2:06:42.440 --> 2:06:47.640]  literally and so that's but but nobody talks about that attack on the black community nobody
[2:06:47.640 --> 2:06:52.040]  talks about planned parenthood more murdering tens of millions of black babies no that doesn't go
[2:06:52.040 --> 2:06:57.960]  with the narrative the narrative is white bad police bad and it's all fake sue it's all fake
[2:06:57.960 --> 2:07:03.320]  thank you so much for the call robert in new york go ahead hey oh and how you doing man
[2:07:03.320 --> 2:07:08.840]  great so good thanks for calling just yeah i'm just calling about my business i opened up at
[2:07:08.840 --> 2:07:16.520]  defiance colmo um it was more about a display of power against him than than anything financial so
[2:07:16.520 --> 2:07:22.760]  stewart rhodes actually flew up from texas the president of votekeepers to stand with me and i've
[2:07:22.760 --> 2:07:27.640]  been in defiance for weeks now and i just i don't remember the executive order that he puts on my
[2:07:27.640 --> 2:07:33.320]  doorstep or has the uh department of health delivered to me and i'm concerned about everyone else
[2:07:33.320 --> 2:07:37.080]  that's just let me just ask you this and robert i'm having trouble hearing you if you're on speaker
[2:07:37.080 --> 2:07:42.760]  please get off you but but let me ask you this i mean because you see there's protests every night
[2:07:42.760 --> 2:07:47.880]  in new york city a lot of it gets violent a lot of it turns into riding and looting and burning
[2:07:48.600 --> 2:07:53.320]  qualmo has barely even said boo about that but he's harassing business owners who dare reopen
[2:07:53.320 --> 2:07:57.960]  them so i mean what are other business owners saying i mean there has to be kind of a little
[2:07:57.960 --> 2:08:02.840]  talk in the small business community like hey qualmo's trying to screw us here well people
[2:08:02.840 --> 2:08:07.640]  are scared of him and the sheriffs are also scared of him we had i mean he is a mass murderer so
[2:08:07.640 --> 2:08:13.880]  yeah i guess there should be some fear there again i mean you know but at one point the
[2:08:13.880 --> 2:08:17.640]  people stand up i mean that there's millions and millions of people and everyone's just
[2:08:17.640 --> 2:08:23.400]  falling down to this but i i'm i'm nervous for our our patriots here in america because
[2:08:23.400 --> 2:08:27.560]  i'm not seeing what should be going on and happen and you know what let me just say this too let me
[2:08:27.560 --> 2:08:35.400]  just say this police officers or police precincts and state troopers and all this stuff any form
[2:08:35.400 --> 2:08:42.920]  of law enforcement needs to understand something right now if you get orders from a democrat governor
[2:08:42.920 --> 2:08:48.840]  or mayor or a politician of any source that is you're now taking orders from an enemy operation
[2:08:49.480 --> 2:08:54.680]  you're now taking orders from something that is not american and so when they tell you to start
[2:08:54.680 --> 2:09:00.040]  going to people's doorsteps whether it's a business or a a citizen for whatever reason they say
[2:09:00.040 --> 2:09:07.720]  and you follow that order you're now following an illegal treasonous order being issued by democrats
[2:09:07.720 --> 2:09:12.600]  so so law enforcement needs to know that because qualmo will start sending people to your doorstep
[2:09:12.600 --> 2:09:17.000]  he'll never stop a riot and then you'll get arrested for opening a business or you'll get
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:21.720]  arrested for even saying something bad about him you you watch anything else robert 20 seconds
[2:09:22.360 --> 2:09:27.320]  yeah the police stood down completely i mean i notified them i basically told them if you if
[2:09:27.320 --> 2:09:32.440]  you impose these executive orders you're defying your oath to uphold the constitution and defend
[2:09:32.440 --> 2:09:37.800]  me as an american so they sit down people need to stand up and trump's not going to save us this
[2:09:37.800 --> 2:09:42.680]  way the people this country yeah again all these thousands of people marching in brooklyn should
[2:09:42.680 --> 2:09:49.720]  have been at qualmo's house demanding his arrest this is a pandemic survival alert and the most
[2:09:49.720 --> 2:09:55.000]  time sensitive messages you will hear this year you still have time to plan a one-acre crisis

[2:12:02.280 --> 2:12:07.560]  i personally am ordering more storable food i have to now start going into defense posture
[2:12:07.560 --> 2:12:13.080]  80 offence but i've always been 100 offence trying to fully you know stop the globalists
[2:12:13.080 --> 2:12:18.040]  and we've given them a good run and i think down the road they'll be defeated but we're
[2:12:18.040 --> 2:12:23.240]  going to still go down the hard road now there were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down but uh
[2:12:23.240 --> 2:12:27.160]  we've mitigated some of this but it's it's still going to be bad my view you need to get high

[2:12:45.880 --> 2:12:50.360]  you ain't seen nothing yet i don't like coming to you every day on the radio and tv stations
[2:12:50.360 --> 2:12:54.600]  that you watch and listen to us on and telling you all these horrible things but you notice
[2:12:54.600 --> 2:13:01.080]  almost everything we've talked about horrible has come true we were warning everybody to try to stop
[2:13:01.080 --> 2:13:06.360]  it it's like telling somebody if you got a pool put a fence around it if you have little kids
[2:13:06.360 --> 2:13:10.360]  because even if they're good swimmers they can hit their head and drown people don't listen they go
[2:13:10.360 --> 2:13:14.680]  out and their kids dead in the pool well ladies and gentlemen this is the death of the third world
[2:13:14.680 --> 2:13:20.280]  in the collapse of the first world and this is 21st century warfare carried out by the globalist
[2:13:20.280 --> 2:13:25.400]  and they admit they've orchestrated it they admit it's quote good to save the earth and
[2:13:25.400 --> 2:13:29.800]  they're teaching us to be more frugal and they want to make us poor so they can dictate our
[2:13:29.800 --> 2:13:35.400]  surrender to this post-human technocracy i know all this sounds insane when i was talking about
[2:13:35.400 --> 2:13:41.400]  it 25 years ago but now it's public because it's their operations manual i wish this wasn't the
[2:13:41.400 --> 2:13:45.960]  case but they're really our evil psychopaths in control of most major institutions and we've
[2:13:45.960 --> 2:13:57.320]  got to stop them you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:13:57.320 --> 2:14:14.840]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show with owin croyer
[2:14:17.560 --> 2:14:21.480]  all right i'm gonna go right back to your phone calls and then alex jones will be joining us
[2:14:21.480 --> 2:14:25.240]  let's go to taylor who's called in from california thank you for calling taylor
[2:14:25.240 --> 2:14:30.840]  hey are you doing oh and can you hear me yes go ahead all right man you guys are great
[2:14:30.840 --> 2:14:36.040]  him for war is great alex jones is great i know you guys have to allude to a lot of things because
[2:14:36.840 --> 2:14:42.280]  you're pretty much handcuffed because you can only report with documented facts yeah like real quick
[2:14:42.280 --> 2:14:46.920]  like there's so much going on with this george floyd thing and and and we can't even talk about it
[2:14:46.920 --> 2:14:52.200]  because it's like if we even talk about something that's so crazy they sue us for the next 10 years
[2:14:52.200 --> 2:14:56.680]  i'll just leave it that but but you're right on go ahead taylor yeah like i know you guys are
[2:14:56.680 --> 2:15:01.320]  basically pointing the way to the way you know you guys are definitely making it obvious what's
[2:15:01.320 --> 2:15:06.920]  really going on here and i think that a lot of your viewers would they would benefit from
[2:15:06.920 --> 2:15:11.080]  watching this documentary called universal disclosure it's on youtube you know you might
[2:15:11.080 --> 2:15:16.600]  want to catch it before they take it down it's universal disclosure by marin kenney and it just
[2:15:16.600 --> 2:15:22.200]  talks about like the whole the whole spectrum view of things you know the political side astrological
[2:15:22.200 --> 2:15:27.000]  side because obviously it's a huge shift going on and you guys have to stay within a certain
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:32.440]  realm because it's your lane and i know you don't want to you know push people too far from the
[2:15:32.440 --> 2:15:36.680]  from the you don't want to look like a tinfoil hat wearing you know group basically i know you
[2:15:36.680 --> 2:15:42.520]  guys are aware of what's going on the the silent joust that's happening but if you're viewers i feel
[2:15:42.520 --> 2:15:48.200]  like if they were to watch universal disclosure getting is that a is that a new release you're
[2:15:48.200 --> 2:15:55.160]  saying on youtube it came out at the end of 2018 and it's uh it's been buried basically it's been
[2:15:55.160 --> 2:15:59.320]  shadow banned but well how long is that because we could just pull it and put it on banned out video
[2:15:59.320 --> 2:16:04.600]  right now it's 45 minutes i think it would do it it would do a service to anybody in here because
[2:16:04.600 --> 2:16:10.280]  here's the thing too you know we uh i mean the bandwidth that banned out video is not cheap and
[2:16:10.280 --> 2:16:14.600]  so you know we got to pay the bills and and we want us i mean believe me we want to platform all of
[2:16:14.600 --> 2:16:19.960]  this stuff uh the problem is it just becomes a bandwidth issue but uh we'll definitely pull
[2:16:19.960 --> 2:16:25.880]  that in and maybe upload it to ban just so we can have it archived yeah i just want to say like
[2:16:25.880 --> 2:16:31.000]  you know we're going into like basically a huge polarity here then it seems to be like they're
[2:16:31.000 --> 2:16:36.440]  pushing people towards literally breatharianism or transhumanism that's pretty much the way
[2:16:36.440 --> 2:16:41.560]  they're going to push this with the food shortages and everything and i feel like that's kind of you
[2:16:41.560 --> 2:16:45.000]  know and not to sound too extreme but that's pretty much the polarity we're dealing with you know
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:50.600]  but i think breath yeah and breath work and intermittent fasting conscious fasting is definitely
[2:16:50.600 --> 2:16:54.280]  something that we're going to have to incorporate in order to get through these these rough patches
[2:16:54.280 --> 2:16:59.000]  here yeah and you know it's amazing that you also say that folks because here's what it comes down to
[2:16:59.000 --> 2:17:08.040]  i mean humanity is in in in store for a thousand years of slavery or a thousand years of the most
[2:17:08.040 --> 2:17:14.360]  empowering times to ever be a human and depending on i mean if you believe the bible we're inevitably
[2:17:14.360 --> 2:17:19.400]  heading towards a thousand years of slavery before jesus comes back anyway but uh i'd like to think
[2:17:19.400 --> 2:17:26.440]  not i'd like to think we can stop that and have a pro human future uh but i mean folks the the the
[2:17:26.440 --> 2:17:33.560]  evil the corruption the establishment all of it it's it's a thousand years of human bondage run by
[2:17:34.920 --> 2:17:42.680]  ai controlled by a very small elite and we're in the battleground of that now uh very great
[2:17:42.680 --> 2:17:48.200]  call there from taylor very understanding of the situation let's go to hu in washington go ahead hu
[2:17:48.200 --> 2:17:57.880]  oh and drop trial bro he had me rolling on that one i wanted to know what happened to you after
[2:17:57.880 --> 2:18:02.920]  post nadler i probably missed it but you got sick or something do you think it was corona
[2:18:05.000 --> 2:18:10.920]  probably i mean i you were gone for quite a while now there's a lot of people praying for it we're
[2:18:10.920 --> 2:18:15.560]  worried about well i never get sick too and believe me and i had uh a couple people that saw how sick
[2:18:15.560 --> 2:18:20.440]  i was wanted me to go to a uh emergency room or something and uh i never had any interest i trusted
[2:18:20.440 --> 2:18:24.680]  my immune system in my body but yeah for about seven to ten days i was sick as a dog but uh
[2:18:25.240 --> 2:18:30.920]  maybe it was corona maybe it wasn't point is it was a bad flu it didn't kill me but oh if i but
[2:18:30.920 --> 2:18:35.320]  here's the if i say i had corona and then they test me and then it's like oh i have to be contact
[2:18:35.320 --> 2:18:47.880]  trace now well screw that did you happen to catch davos 2019 uh what about it was on youtube at the
[2:18:47.880 --> 2:18:54.520]  first like in january of of 2019 they had all their billionaires in the in the auditorium
[2:18:54.520 --> 2:19:02.600]  and you had this big uh screen up there and sally was introducing herself as ai and for some reason
[2:19:02.600 --> 2:19:09.000]  you know oh oh that that ai robot that votes in uh saudi arabia or whatever forest whittaker was
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:15.400]  asked to stand at that podium and talk to sally as she introduced herself as ai now being converted
[2:19:15.400 --> 2:19:21.080]  to hi i think are you are you mean so fia the crew's saying so fia do you mean so fia
[2:19:21.080 --> 2:19:28.200]  it was so fia yeah okay yeah the the point is is that that that the ai was introducing itself as
[2:19:28.200 --> 2:19:35.960]  wanting to become hi which is short for hybrid intelligence and it was asking you to enter
[2:19:35.960 --> 2:19:41.560]  in to their domain or cloud whatever you want to call it database and give everything about
[2:19:41.560 --> 2:19:46.120]  how you think all your personality so it can analyze you and you can become one with it
[2:19:46.120 --> 2:19:51.080]  that was very significant it seemed like it went under the carpet nobody paid any attention to it
[2:19:51.080 --> 2:19:57.800]  but now ai has become hi well that's very tough for people to understand or even catch on you
[2:19:57.800 --> 2:20:03.000]  and uh i'm gonna have to go here because we're going to go back to alex jones but this is all
[2:20:03.000 --> 2:20:10.120]  being ruled out by design and that's that's the key to understanding this it's all being ruled out
[2:20:10.120 --> 2:20:16.920]  by design and so if you think a police force is bad now with humans uh wait till you have robots
[2:20:17.480 --> 2:20:22.920]  that can't even think or judge a situation and just act via programming and then who are you
[2:20:22.920 --> 2:20:28.120]  gonna sue well it won't even matter because they'll have a situation set up like the vaccine court
[2:20:28.120 --> 2:20:34.440]  where you can't sue anybody and it'll be a special court and they'll just issue payoffs and oh there'll
[2:20:34.440 --> 2:20:39.240]  be probably a million robot police officers killing humans but that story won't matter because guess
[2:20:39.240 --> 2:20:44.120]  what the same people that run the robot manufacturing companies pay for all the news on tv so you'll
[2:20:44.120 --> 2:20:48.680]  never ever see it covered but that's just the future if we let it get there let's go back
[2:20:48.680 --> 2:20:56.120]  now to alex jones reporting on what the un has in store for us if we defund the police it's not
[2:20:56.120 --> 2:21:03.480]  even hidden the united nations established by the rockefeller family the roth childs and a consortium
[2:21:03.480 --> 2:21:10.120]  of multinational corporations is designed to slowly absorb the nation's state and now they're
[2:21:10.120 --> 2:21:15.720]  entering the final phase of actually taking over at the city level as the former attorney general
[2:21:15.720 --> 2:21:21.000]  loretta lynch who at the time was attorney general in new york at the un over a two-day period gave
[2:21:21.000 --> 2:21:26.600]  hours and hours and hours of testimony about how they were doing this she also spoke with the now
[2:21:26.600 --> 2:21:31.880]  mayor of new york mayor de blasio this is called immunization where if they can't get the nation's
[2:21:31.880 --> 2:21:36.600]  state to sign over all its sovereignty they simply go into the local level and take control that way
[2:21:36.600 --> 2:21:43.000]  using hundreds of billions of dollars of major foundation money provided by microsoft google
[2:21:43.000 --> 2:21:49.560]  apple and the usual suspects to buy out controllable government they then buy out control of the
[2:21:49.560 --> 2:21:56.040]  national health services with grants and so it goes on through the military it goes on through
[2:21:56.040 --> 2:22:02.120]  banking it goes on through academia called roundtable groups where every major institution ends up
[2:22:02.120 --> 2:22:08.280]  being controlled by the very same globalist who are then able to create the policies they want
[2:22:08.280 --> 2:22:14.200]  at the un level that are then enforced at the national state and local level so when we come
[2:22:14.200 --> 2:22:20.120]  back we're going to air john bounds critical report on how the united nations is directing
[2:22:20.120 --> 2:22:25.720]  this entire scam and how we need to leave the united nations we need to cut our funding the
[2:22:25.720 --> 2:22:31.000]  united nations we need to recognize that it is a communist globalist criminal organization
[2:22:31.000 --> 2:22:36.520]  that's why every major corporation is behind it because they have created it to establish
[2:22:36.520 --> 2:22:41.960]  a planetary worldwide corporate governance well they're right back on the other side
[2:22:41.960 --> 2:22:46.760]  with the report from john bound and then more about shroyer i'm alex jones please stay with us
[2:22:48.040 --> 2:22:51.880]  let's go to one in connecticut you're on the air thanks for holding yeah hello can you hear me

[2:23:30.760 --> 2:23:34.440]  so this this was designed on one of the top guys in the country he didn't want his name on it because
[2:23:34.440 --> 2:23:37.720]  obviously the political issues but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the
[2:23:37.720 --> 2:23:42.520]  design of it and we believe it is the best strongest but healthiest energy out there and
[2:23:42.520 --> 2:23:45.480]  you're saying that it's made your life better so that means a lot to me thank you to all your
[2:23:45.480 --> 2:23:57.160]  truck drivers we love you globalists have gotten away with their russia gate hoax their
[2:23:57.160 --> 2:24:07.480]  ukraine hoax their covid-19 hoax and now it's the race riot hoax of 2020 we've got to ask ourselves
[2:24:07.480 --> 2:24:12.280]  what's coming next well i can tell you it's going to be a bunch of big old fat mass shootings
[2:24:12.280 --> 2:24:18.120]  to create even a bigger race war it's going to be economic collapse china invading taiwan
[2:24:18.120 --> 2:24:24.840]  hong kong you name it the globalists are attacking on every front that's why now more than ever we
[2:24:24.840 --> 2:24:30.360]  have to realize they tried to censor info wars off the air because they knew when they launched this
[2:24:30.360 --> 2:24:35.800]  whole situation that they didn't want the people's voice to still be on air but thanks to you and our
[2:24:35.800 --> 2:24:41.880]  crew we are still on air so let's boost that transmission like the batman's signal now more
[2:24:41.880 --> 2:24:49.320]  than ever info wars dot com lives i'm always excited about info wars life products they're
[2:24:49.320 --> 2:24:53.320]  amazing they're cutting edge you love them i love them and they find the info war in the face of the
[2:24:53.320 --> 2:25:01.800]  globalist onslaught but we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing
[2:25:01.800 --> 2:25:09.880]  the only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it and there's
[2:25:09.880 --> 2:25:18.520]  another innovation it's the spray cap it doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick gross goo but it's
[2:25:18.520 --> 2:25:23.560]  high quality it aerosolizes it in a really great way i'd like to put it on my hands rub a little
[2:25:23.560 --> 2:25:29.640]  of my face it's got organic alcohol in it so spray it around your eyes but i just love it personally
[2:25:29.640 --> 2:25:34.600]  has something that's a moisturizer as well so this is a real innovation i don't know why others
[2:25:34.600 --> 2:25:39.320]  think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't
[2:25:39.320 --> 2:25:52.120]  dry you out smells great it's so refreshing this is a big winner you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:25:52.120 --> 2:26:11.400]  the democrats emerged to ask for civility for black americans when they have not shown a shred
[2:26:11.400 --> 2:26:19.720]  of civility towards the rest of america mr bunjino dylan roof is white is that correct yeah i don't
[2:26:19.720 --> 2:26:25.800]  know where you're going with this so if he's white that doesn't make him any better or it was an awful
[2:26:25.800 --> 2:26:30.360]  thing he did whether he was white or black i'm sure we were going with this dylan roof was white
[2:26:30.360 --> 2:26:37.320]  and as to the chairman's comments about civility the president of the united states of america
[2:26:37.320 --> 2:26:44.280]  has advocated violence he has been divisive and he has been the one that has caused what we see
[2:26:44.280 --> 2:26:50.520]  happening today where people are trying to push back on his policies and where people are trying to
[2:26:50.520 --> 2:26:58.120]  have peaceful protests instead of violence but he continues to call names and he continues to challenge
[2:26:58.120 --> 2:27:04.440]  people in very violent ways meanwhile after tens of millions of dollars worth of damage to new york
[2:27:04.440 --> 2:27:11.080]  city former clinton and obama underling loretta lynch is called upon by new york attorney general
[2:27:11.080 --> 2:27:18.360]  latisha james to oversee a predictably pro looters and neoliberal socialist instigator cleanup job
[2:27:18.360 --> 2:27:24.760]  flying in the face of federal oversight on top of that lynch isn't there to follow up on the millions
[2:27:24.760 --> 2:27:31.640]  of merchandise looted by peaceful protesters loretta lynch is there to further apply pressure to an
[2:27:31.640 --> 2:27:37.000]  already crippled new york police department as the hill reported new york attorney general
[2:27:37.000 --> 2:27:43.480]  latisha james said in a statement as we continue our investigation i will continue to use every tool
[2:27:43.480 --> 2:27:49.720]  at my disposal to seek answers and accountability and that includes calling on the sharpest minds
[2:27:49.720 --> 2:27:56.200]  to lend their expertise lynch added it is time to examine recent events to ensure that all new
[2:27:56.200 --> 2:28:02.680]  yorkers receive truly equal protection under the law you may recall loretta lynch launched the
[2:28:02.680 --> 2:28:09.000]  strong city's network in 2015 at the united nations with a panel of leftist u.s. mayors
[2:28:09.000 --> 2:28:14.600]  including new york's deblazio who has thumbed his nose at the new york police department ever since
[2:28:14.600 --> 2:28:21.400]  i want to say to my fellow mayors uh we are in the vanguard of change around the world as the
[2:28:21.400 --> 2:28:27.320]  high commissioner indicated and we should hold ourselves to a high standard we're able to do
[2:28:27.320 --> 2:28:35.720]  things locally uh that in many ways can set the pace for our national governments and i think
[2:28:35.720 --> 2:28:41.400]  so many of us through the work we've done in our cities we understand something fundamental
[2:28:42.200 --> 2:28:50.200]  the most powerful way to counter violent extremism is to go to the core the core is intolerance
[2:28:50.200 --> 2:28:57.560]  when we address intolerance when we undermine intolerance in the process we undermine extremism
[2:28:57.560 --> 2:29:06.200]  and violence but i see the incredible opportunity of the strong city's network is going far beyond
[2:29:06.200 --> 2:29:12.120]  the work of law enforcement going to some of the things that all of us know we could do better
[2:29:12.120 --> 2:29:19.720]  the nurturing of our youth and particularly of youth leadership positive leadership that can help
[2:29:20.760 --> 2:29:28.200]  to move other youth towards positive outcomes in our society this is a truly groundbreaking
[2:29:28.200 --> 2:29:34.840]  endeavor by connecting municipal leaders by facilitating information sharing and providing
[2:29:34.840 --> 2:29:40.280]  training and other assistance where appropriate the strong city's network will help to fashion a
[2:29:40.280 --> 2:29:47.640]  global response to a global issue without losing sight of its inherently local roots it will offer
[2:29:47.640 --> 2:29:53.000]  city leaders a way to learn from one another about successful initiatives and productive programs
[2:29:53.640 --> 2:29:59.720]  by connecting these localities to one another as this network the strong city's network is doing
[2:29:59.720 --> 2:30:06.200]  we will not only have a powerful way to lift up our communities worldwide we will send a message
[2:30:06.200 --> 2:30:13.400]  a message from all of our voices about who we are and about what we aspire to be as an alliance
[2:30:13.400 --> 2:30:19.960]  of nations in a global community the strong city's network is a network focused on supporting cities
[2:30:19.960 --> 2:30:25.000]  to prevent all forms of violent extremism it is important to remember that while
[2:30:25.000 --> 2:30:30.520]  attention is currently focused on isis and the challenge of foreign fighters the threat of other
[2:30:30.520 --> 2:30:36.520]  forms of violent extremism not least extreme right-wing groups remain critical and of critical
[2:30:36.520 --> 2:30:42.280]  concern to local authorities around the world and the communities that they represent that level
[2:30:42.280 --> 2:30:48.440]  of islamophobia that level of racism that level of xenophobia creates its own counter movement
[2:30:48.440 --> 2:30:53.560]  that we have to look out for it's a challenge to american safety because it's animating other
[2:30:53.560 --> 2:30:59.560]  kinds of extremism and other kinds of a violence against people of color and against uh folks of
[2:30:59.560 --> 2:31:05.880]  them uh you know folks who follow islam lynch had said the strong city's network would have an
[2:31:05.880 --> 2:31:13.080]  international steering committee and an international advisory board run by the institute for strategic
[2:31:13.080 --> 2:31:19.560]  dialogue a leading international think tank based in london under their control law enforcement
[2:31:19.560 --> 2:31:26.120]  measures for cooperating democrat cities will be directed from the institute for strategic dialogue
[2:31:26.120 --> 2:31:33.160]  and the united nations ignoring the u.s constitution local officials and the laws we all operate under
[2:31:33.160 --> 2:31:38.920]  other cities that have not officially signed on are being rewarded with equipment due to their
[2:31:38.920 --> 2:31:44.120]  interest in the strong city's network meanwhile former new york city police commissioner
[2:31:44.120 --> 2:31:50.760]  bernard caring said 600 police officers were considering leaving the force amid protests
[2:31:50.760 --> 2:31:56.760]  in response to the death of george floyd all right commissioner karak how many police officers
[2:31:56.760 --> 2:32:02.520]  are in the hospital right now that the mainstream media is not talking about well you've had over
[2:32:02.520 --> 2:32:08.760]  300 i think about 320 that have been injured you have some in the hospital but there were over 300
[2:32:08.760 --> 2:32:17.080]  the 300 injuries and and the thing that scares me uh judge i'm hearing close to 600 cops have
[2:32:17.080 --> 2:32:23.000]  either put in their papers or they're talking to the department about resigning or retiring
[2:32:23.000 --> 2:32:28.440]  while mayor deblasio unveiled a few reforms to the new york police department at the urging of a
[2:32:28.440 --> 2:32:34.840]  task force on racial inclusion of which his wife is co-chairwoman redirecting money from the police
[2:32:34.840 --> 2:32:41.000]  department to youth programs is among the proposed changes the budget of the new york police department
[2:32:41.000 --> 2:32:47.560]  was nearly six billion dollars in 2019 and now new york comptroller scott stringer is calling for
[2:32:47.560 --> 2:32:54.200]  1.1 billion to be cut from the new york police department budget over four years how convenient
[2:32:54.200 --> 2:32:59.560]  that the new york police department would be targeted by loretta lynch's united nations police
[2:32:59.560 --> 2:33:06.040]  force steering committee it appears that defunding the police is simply the beginning as democrat
[2:33:06.040 --> 2:33:12.440]  cities are transforming their local police forces into internationally interested united nations
[2:33:12.440 --> 2:33:19.000]  armies that will crush any that oppose the will of the totalitarian left and its dismantling of
[2:33:19.000 --> 2:33:31.400]  america john bound reporting you know i remember alex jones writing reports and documentaries on
[2:33:31.400 --> 2:33:39.320]  this 10 years ago plus but this is now all updated information in that john bound report which you
[2:33:39.320 --> 2:33:44.840]  can find at band dot video spread this video to your friends and family folks because the entire
[2:33:44.840 --> 2:33:51.320]  media structure is aimed against the police right now but we need to understand that this is just
[2:33:51.320 --> 2:34:03.320]  part of the agenda to out the police and bring in the un which won't be beholden to any constitution
[2:34:03.320 --> 2:34:16.920]  or oath or america at all you know i'll just say this if president trump isn't going to deal with
[2:34:16.920 --> 2:34:28.040]  these people legally i should say this but uh if president trump doesn't deal with these people
[2:34:28.040 --> 2:34:34.120]  legally and bill bar and john durham and and we don't have mass arrests and military tribunals
[2:34:34.680 --> 2:34:39.720]  of the loretta lynches of the world and the obama administration and clinton and the rest of them
[2:34:39.720 --> 2:34:47.640]  uh well this country will either be dead and gone or we're going to have to physically fight for it
[2:34:50.760 --> 2:34:54.120]  and the police are the front lines right now folks
[2:34:57.880 --> 2:35:02.680]  i just uh just breaks my heart breaks my heart
[2:35:02.680 --> 2:35:09.240]  because police are being completely just thrown under the bus right now
[2:35:11.640 --> 2:35:14.360]  and yeah what are they gonna do when they're just put out there like a target
[2:35:14.920 --> 2:35:18.680]  and they can't even defend themselves and now they're getting their pay cut and losing their
[2:35:18.680 --> 2:35:26.280]  pension yeah of course the police are gonna quit it's all by design ladies and gentlemen it's all
[2:35:26.280 --> 2:35:34.200]  by design boy i hope president trump doesn't let him be the way with us folks i really hope he doesn't
[2:35:35.640 --> 2:35:40.440]  he'll control his own destiny but let me tell you there will be a hot civil war
[2:35:41.560 --> 2:35:45.000]  and uh well we know who the enemies of america are

[2:37:56.280 --> 2:38:01.720]  order is instituting race war and division and telling the people that rebellion is about
[2:38:01.720 --> 2:38:09.000]  overthrowing your local police and government and destroying essential services this is an attempt
[2:38:09.000 --> 2:38:14.120]  to have society collapse and the globalists as they've done in the third world will come in and
[2:38:14.120 --> 2:38:20.520]  pick up the pieces you must stand against the u.n the imf the world bank and the u openly saying

[2:38:25.480 --> 2:38:29.640]  government and our local tabulary and believe me once the globalists have overthrown this country
[2:38:29.640 --> 2:38:35.000]  they are going to put in a real police state where you have no due process or freedom the globalist
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:40.520]  believe communist china is the model of the world and they are orchestrating this entire thing the
[2:38:40.520 --> 2:38:46.360]  people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed info wars dot com
[2:38:47.080 --> 2:38:51.640]  i was talking to my patreon supplier great suppliers you can now say four weeks on average

[2:40:06.840 --> 2:40:17.000]  the united nations openly hijacked police departments the last seven minutes 45 seconds
[2:40:17.800 --> 2:40:22.760]  you heard the proof laid out if you're listening on radio if you're watching on television you
[2:40:22.760 --> 2:40:27.880]  could actually see the video you could see the documents you could see the clips and the admissions
[2:40:27.880 --> 2:40:36.520]  this all goes back to state department memorandum 7277 from 1962 where there was an open
[2:40:36.520 --> 2:40:42.120]  attempt to put the united states under united nations control and it's the exact same program
[2:40:42.840 --> 2:40:48.760]  being tried again the united nations has been accepted in almost every country in the world
[2:40:48.760 --> 2:40:56.520]  as the governing power that's why with covet 19 we're told oh medical doctors get swapped team
[2:40:56.520 --> 2:41:04.600]  raids because they're prescribing vitamin c in texas and michigan to people who have covet
[2:41:04.600 --> 2:41:08.280]  doesn't matter if the study show it's great for any type of coronavirus doesn't matter
[2:41:08.280 --> 2:41:13.720]  of study show that almost all of these problems with coronaviruses is because of deficiencies of cd
[2:41:15.160 --> 2:41:22.360]  and things like zinc but again that's the united nations in control oh sorry just everyone
[2:41:22.360 --> 2:41:31.400]  breathlessly the who says but who funds it bella melinda gates it's the very same big tax-free
[2:41:31.400 --> 2:41:36.360]  foundations they're running the show they're running the takeover of education they're running
[2:41:36.360 --> 2:41:42.360]  the brainwashing at the colleges it's all centralized from the establishment it's not
[2:41:43.080 --> 2:41:48.280]  communists in their basements that are directing all of this so you can laugh at it and call it
[2:41:48.280 --> 2:41:53.800]  stupid all day and say it has no sense of purpose and that's going to fail but it's only the cover
[2:41:54.680 --> 2:41:59.800]  for the larger globalist agenda to take over all health care to take over all regulations to
[2:41:59.800 --> 2:42:06.760]  domesticate us and to take over the police department's just like lawyers in the last 30 years got rid
[2:42:06.760 --> 2:42:12.040]  of all of the diving boards and now they're getting rid of barbecue pits at the park because somebody
[2:42:12.040 --> 2:42:16.920]  might hurt themselves now they're getting rid of jungle gyms and now pools are two feet deep and
[2:42:16.920 --> 2:42:24.200]  now they're getting rid of all sorts of things if you can claim there's any risk associated with it
[2:42:24.200 --> 2:42:27.560]  well police are going to make mistakes there's going to be problems and this is people are going
[2:42:27.560 --> 2:42:33.480]  to get killed sometimes and so by taking immunity away from the police that sounds like a great idea
[2:42:33.480 --> 2:42:38.440]  but really it bankrupts the local government and then once the UN and the globalist control
[2:42:38.440 --> 2:42:44.680]  well then the media won't cover any police mistakes and it'll be problem solved that's how
[2:42:44.680 --> 2:42:52.680]  the system operates they have it down to a very fine science of using liability in our open free
[2:42:52.680 --> 2:42:59.400]  society to target selectively through lawfare whatever the system wants to shut down we're
[2:42:59.400 --> 2:43:02.920]  going to go back to live broadcast and oh and destroyer for a few more segments and then
[2:43:02.920 --> 2:43:07.800]  we have Charles Salente taking over i'll be filing more reports in the hours and days to come but
[2:43:07.800 --> 2:43:11.720]  again this is such a critical time to face this head on and understand what we're really dealing
[2:43:11.720 --> 2:43:16.520]  with it's a very systematic takeover and the globalists admit in their own writings that
[2:43:16.520 --> 2:43:21.720]  that they're coordinating and using these crises to gain more control they don't create every crisis
[2:43:21.720 --> 2:43:27.000]  they do create some but they are exacerbating crises and i know you all know this but we have
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:31.000]  to understand this is the main assault they're intending to steal the election from trump
[2:43:31.000 --> 2:43:34.040]  and trump needs to wake up and i'll be speaking about that more in the days to come
[2:43:34.040 --> 2:43:38.440]  but please share this report on the united nations now it's on info wars dot com and band
[2:43:38.440 --> 2:43:46.200]  dot video you are the resistance remember that folks band dot video and as always your support
[2:43:46.200 --> 2:43:50.360]  at info wars store dot com is crucial i want to go back out to the phone lines we're going to be
[2:43:50.360 --> 2:43:55.400]  hearing again from alex bones here in just a minute in the meantime let's go to amy in kentucky
[2:43:55.400 --> 2:44:06.120]  go ahead amy hey owen hello can you hear can you hear me yes okay so i've been looking back over
[2:44:06.120 --> 2:44:11.560]  joe biden's speeches lately and all that stuff and one thing that just keeps coming back
[2:44:12.360 --> 2:44:17.560]  as a same question that keeps coming to my mind is every time he's asked what he's done for black
[2:44:17.560 --> 2:44:24.280]  supporters he pretty much like sits around the question and starts talking about who supports
[2:44:24.280 --> 2:44:30.280]  him and everything and i'm just um to me that's a big red flag if you can't as a grown man simply
[2:44:30.280 --> 2:44:36.120]  answer a question saying what you've done to support black people and all you can say is who
[2:44:36.120 --> 2:44:41.560]  supports you i feel like that's a problem well i mean that's like the that's like the smallest
[2:44:41.560 --> 2:44:47.000]  problem about joe biden i mean this guy is a classic career criminal he was engaged in all
[2:44:47.000 --> 2:44:52.520]  sorts of treason with obama he had his own treason going on with ukraine and his son hunter and in
[2:44:52.520 --> 2:44:57.400]  china uh so yeah i mean joe biden pandering for black people when he hasn't done anything for him
[2:44:57.400 --> 2:45:04.200]  is like a tiny small scale issue and the just largest corruption that is by i mean the democrats
[2:45:04.200 --> 2:45:08.120]  just went with the most corrupt guy they could find i mean joe biden can't even think he can't
[2:45:08.120 --> 2:45:14.200]  even control his own bowels uh and so whatever he says during a campaign speech is just fodder
[2:45:14.200 --> 2:45:20.840]  anyway the real threat is that man is a world-class criminal joe biden is a world-class criminal
[2:45:20.840 --> 2:45:27.320]  and belongs in jail uh simply put amy thanks for the call uh guys can i see my uh caller
[2:45:27.320 --> 2:45:31.160]  list here otherwise i'm gonna have to go to the top and go to vivian in west virginia let's just
[2:45:31.160 --> 2:45:38.360]  go to vivian and then i'll go back down to there go ahead vivian hello yes you're on the air oh
[2:45:38.360 --> 2:45:45.800]  okay i had a beep there um i am christian i'm conservative of course been sharing a lot of
[2:45:45.800 --> 2:45:53.480]  your videos on uh facebook which i'm surprised i'm still on there as boisterous as i am and i
[2:45:53.480 --> 2:46:01.640]  will be sharing this one also um i understand some of your feelings about trump but i'm not
[2:46:01.640 --> 2:46:08.840]  sure he can do everything that you want him to do by himself uh does there not have to be some type
[2:46:08.840 --> 2:46:15.080]  of law process for all these people to get arrested and that would take forever here let me let me
[2:46:15.080 --> 2:46:22.040]  respond to this because i have a short amount of time here vivian if trump or the american people
[2:46:22.040 --> 2:46:29.080]  want to play games within the rules and the boundaries that the enemies do not care to play
[2:46:29.080 --> 2:46:36.280]  by those rules or boundaries then we will never win and that's my short response here's another
[2:46:37.080 --> 2:46:43.080]  avenue i thought about too what if this is god's judgment well it's all god's plan it's all god's
[2:46:43.080 --> 2:46:51.240]  plan but that doesn't mean i sit here idly by letting it happen god's plan can we stop it
[2:46:52.120 --> 2:46:57.400]  i'm just asking well yeah but god's plan god's plan isn't for you to do nothing and have blind faith
[2:46:57.400 --> 2:47:05.080]  in a man no i'm not saying that you're completely misunderstand what i'm saying i'm not a
[2:47:05.080 --> 2:47:11.320]  a trump or advocate exactly here but i'm just saying he can't do it all by himself he's gonna
[2:47:11.320 --> 2:47:18.120]  have to have lawyers and and people like that he can however get out of the un quickly which
[2:47:18.120 --> 2:47:25.000]  he wants to do that but i'm not sure how much he can do on his own but but let me ask you this vivian
[2:47:25.000 --> 2:47:29.480]  if let's say you're you're in the united states and you see a violent group of terrorists taking
[2:47:29.480 --> 2:47:35.160]  over towns burning and looting you see rampant corruption you see trees and happening who do
[2:47:35.160 --> 2:47:39.400]  you look to to solve those issues who do you say hey we need to do something about this who would you
[2:47:39.400 --> 2:47:47.080]  look to well i don't know you'd have to go through some sort of law and i think you do know i just
[2:47:47.080 --> 2:47:52.040]  think you don't want to admit it i think you know it's the president you know everything is always
[2:47:52.040 --> 2:47:57.320]  trump's fault no matter what he does it's giving thanks for the call i gotta go back to alex jones
[2:47:57.320 --> 2:48:01.880]  folks vivian i love you you're you're god-fearing lady but unfortunately i think that your mindset
[2:48:01.880 --> 2:48:07.960]  right now is the mindset of way too many trump supporters i never blamed trump for anything
[2:48:07.960 --> 2:48:11.640]  i'm not blaming trump trump's been in office less than four years he's not responsible for all this
[2:48:11.640 --> 2:48:16.440]  stuff of course not info wars myself included were supporting trump before anybody else out there
[2:48:16.440 --> 2:48:23.160]  my point is that all these trump supporters are giving trump every excuse under the sun
[2:48:23.160 --> 2:48:31.960]  for his lack of action why you would never provide that cover for anyone else except trump
[2:48:32.600 --> 2:48:37.080]  and i get it he's our only hope he's the guy we need to hit the buzzer beater the game winning
[2:48:37.080 --> 2:48:44.520]  shot the best we've ever had but to sit here and just ignore the fact that he's not taking action
[2:48:44.520 --> 2:48:49.160]  or to give him all the excuses under the sun that's only going to lead to our own demise
[2:48:49.160 --> 2:48:54.920]  that's only going to lead to trump's demise i'm not attacking trump i'm being honest about the
[2:48:54.920 --> 2:49:01.480]  situation look at everything that's happened it's all happened under trump not hillary not hillary
[2:49:02.040 --> 2:49:08.440]  trump now again trump's got the ace of spades will he play it i don't know the plan i'm not
[2:49:08.440 --> 2:49:15.720]  betting on it here's alex jones with more on the un today america would be outraged if un troops
[2:49:15.720 --> 2:49:21.480]  entered los angeles restore order tomorrow they will be grateful this is especially true if they
[2:49:21.480 --> 2:49:27.400]  were told that there was an outside threat from beyond whether real or promulgated that threatened
[2:49:27.400 --> 2:49:33.880]  our very existence it is then that all people of the world will plead to deliver them from the siebel
[2:49:33.880 --> 2:49:40.280]  the one thing every man fears is the unknown when presented with this scenario individual
[2:49:40.280 --> 2:49:44.920]  rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them
[2:49:45.560 --> 2:49:52.520]  by the world government henry kissinger 1991 bill berg conference held in emion france and he
[2:49:52.520 --> 2:49:58.840]  since confirmed he made that statement and that's what the whole black lives matter race riot system
[2:49:58.840 --> 2:50:05.880]  is about funded by kissinger and other globalists and then if you pull back covet 19 the un and
[2:50:05.880 --> 2:50:11.800]  others admit that they also would use the threat of an either real or manufactured bio weapon or
[2:50:11.800 --> 2:50:17.000]  pathogen to bring in world government that's what this is ladies and gentlemen you're being taught
[2:50:17.000 --> 2:50:22.280]  to be locked down by the globalist cult and that's why understanding the world order is now not just
[2:50:22.280 --> 2:50:29.160]  critical it's about our very survival as a species because for the new world order world government
[2:50:29.160 --> 2:50:35.000]  is just the beginning it's the vehicle to get them to planetary control to carry out the foresty
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:42.280]  population and the technology this is the elix my friends my only friends the end of our elaborate
[2:50:42.280 --> 2:50:50.920]  plans the end of everything that stands the end the safety the delusion it's all over ladies and
[2:50:50.920 --> 2:50:58.840]  gentlemen because it was only the mirage of safety movies and partying and living like children
[2:50:58.840 --> 2:51:04.520]  ever growing up ever caring about other people this delivered us into the hands of tyranny
[2:51:05.160 --> 2:51:09.880]  just like the history book show it's just like the bible states every time israel became corrupt
[2:51:09.880 --> 2:51:15.560]  and evil and turned away from god they were brought into captivity because their people
[2:51:15.560 --> 2:51:21.480]  sold out to special interest and were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved we are
[2:51:21.480 --> 2:51:28.360]  repeating that again today compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage
[2:51:29.160 --> 2:51:34.440]  info wars has decided to fight for freedom info wars has had great victory thanks to your support
[2:51:34.440 --> 2:51:41.560]  and your prayers i've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles and
[2:51:41.560 --> 2:51:47.960]  when you shoot an elk and say 600 yards even if you hit them right in the heart they'll still run
[2:51:48.840 --> 2:51:55.640]  50 60 70 maybe 100 yards they've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and
[2:51:55.640 --> 2:52:00.920]  through their veins but all of a sudden they slow down they realize what's happened they fall over
[2:52:00.920 --> 2:52:07.000]  and they die then you go back and then haul them back in well that's what's going to happen to the
[2:52:07.000 --> 2:52:13.640]  entire world now and that's what the economic numbers show is that we've been shot right in the
[2:52:13.640 --> 2:52:18.920]  heart and for the first world it's going to mean a long horrible depression and a lot of death
[2:52:19.800 --> 2:52:23.080]  well for the third world it's going to mean probably over 100 million dead according to you
[2:52:23.080 --> 2:52:28.680]  and i believe their numbers because it's the very un that's orchestrated this to depopulate the third
[2:52:28.680 --> 2:52:32.760]  world so to all the leftists that thought it was their revolution to get rid of trump you're a
[2:52:32.760 --> 2:52:40.920]  bunch of suckers and you bought into something better than what hitler did you're listening to
[2:52:40.920 --> 2:52:51.720]  the alex jones show all right i want to take a couple more phone calls before i hand it over to
[2:52:51.720 --> 2:52:58.920]  jerald salenti coming up here shortly and so let's quickly go to frank in arizona go ahead frank
[2:52:58.920 --> 2:53:06.280]  hey are you doing all good thank you all right great i appreciate your time and i'll be real
[2:53:06.280 --> 2:53:13.640]  quick here um you know everyone everyone supports uh trump in one way or another who watches this
[2:53:13.640 --> 2:53:20.600]  show um but what i've always believed is that republicans and democrats are two sides of the
[2:53:20.600 --> 2:53:31.240]  same coin to me trump hasn't done anything to these treasonists insurrectionist people out there
[2:53:31.240 --> 2:53:39.400]  because he's only controlled opposition he is part of the problem i'd like to see what you say about
[2:53:39.400 --> 2:53:44.920]  that well you know i'm not ready to go that far certainly not and i think the biggest evidence
[2:53:44.920 --> 2:53:50.200]  against that would be the fact that the entire corrupt evil establishment is aimed against
[2:53:50.200 --> 2:53:56.280]  trump 24 7 i mean that that that factor cannot be denied or ignored uh but it also can't be
[2:53:56.280 --> 2:54:00.920]  denied and ignored that the lack of action right now from the president to me is stunning
[2:54:00.920 --> 2:54:04.760]  and people say the same thing well what do you want him to do what is this what are you talking
[2:54:04.760 --> 2:54:10.040]  about what you would do nothing if you were the president you would do nothing of course not
[2:54:10.040 --> 2:54:15.960]  you would be doing something and so i don't know what he needs to do but i mean hell treason is
[2:54:15.960 --> 2:54:21.640]  happening in this country every damn day we've got foreign opposition uh feeding propaganda to the
[2:54:21.640 --> 2:54:27.000]  youth every single day they're illegally shutting i mean he went along with the covet hoax so it's
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:31.800]  just like again i'm not trying to attack trump we need trump he's going to be the guy that has to
[2:54:31.800 --> 2:54:36.600]  make the buzzer beating shot if it comes down to it but i'm also going to call it like it is folks
[2:54:36.600 --> 2:54:42.840]  i'm not in a cult of trump and i think it's really important in fact i want to be honest it's actually
[2:54:42.840 --> 2:54:49.000]  very important for us to be anti-trump not because we're anti-trump or trump's the bad guy but because
[2:54:49.000 --> 2:54:54.600]  the trump supporters have become into such a cult that they're not even holding his feet to the fire
[2:54:54.600 --> 2:55:00.440]  and they're not even holding him accountable for his inaction and so i i just want trump supporters
[2:55:00.440 --> 2:55:05.560]  understand i'm not anti-trump but you gotta bet you better beware if you let trump do nothing
[2:55:06.200 --> 2:55:12.600]  and they just cheat and they put biden in we're done so there's no guarantee trump wins again
[2:55:12.600 --> 2:55:17.320]  and if and if they get trump out of office and he doesn't arrest these deep state criminals and we
[2:55:17.320 --> 2:55:23.240]  don't have military tribunals this country's done folks do you understand trump has a tiny window
[2:55:23.240 --> 2:55:29.400]  to do the right thing and he hasn't done it yet so again i'm not bashing trump that's just the
[2:55:29.400 --> 2:55:38.200]  god's honest truth one one more thing on yeah go ahead the last president that we had that tried
[2:55:38.200 --> 2:55:44.120]  to do some good they killed him his name was john Fitzgerald kennedy and i believe that trump would
[2:55:44.120 --> 2:55:51.720]  be killed if he was really opposition they were to took him out already well or they may be trying
[2:55:51.720 --> 2:55:55.640]  and we just don't even know it yet frank thank you so much for the call let's go quickly to joe
[2:55:55.640 --> 2:56:05.480]  in north carolina go ahead joe hey elwin uh good to talk to you thank you uh so i i i got an idea
[2:56:05.480 --> 2:56:11.480]  to speed up the mass awakening that's happening and i've been sitting on it for a while and it
[2:56:12.120 --> 2:56:17.880]  so people need the resources to be able to argue these facts that are out there and i think most
[2:56:17.880 --> 2:56:24.040]  people don't share it because they're not confident in the information or how to argue it so my idea
[2:56:24.040 --> 2:56:32.040]  is to make t-shirts and they'll be based on specific things that are happening in the in the
[2:56:32.040 --> 2:56:38.600]  world and you can choose the hill you die on essentially and have a pdf of information that
[2:56:38.600 --> 2:56:44.600]  you can print off of the resources and arguable facts that they can bring with them everywhere
[2:56:44.600 --> 2:56:50.840]  they go where they where they wear the t-shirts and it could also be business cards where they state
[2:56:50.840 --> 2:56:55.320]  you know specific facts from the links and articles and things like that and they can hand
[2:56:55.320 --> 2:57:03.720]  those out along with the pdf to spread information and uh i've been i've been sitting on that for a
[2:57:03.720 --> 2:57:09.480]  while but i i haven't been i had the resources to make it happen so i wanted to get it out in the
[2:57:09.480 --> 2:57:15.720]  universe yeah there's no doubt human intelligence folks boots on the ground the 3d world the physical
[2:57:15.720 --> 2:57:21.720]  world is where the next info war is going to be fought because uh as you know the digital world
[2:57:21.720 --> 2:57:28.520]  the internet the social media giants are all corrupted and being censored as we speak so uh real
[2:57:28.520 --> 2:57:35.080]  human intelligence in the third dimension in the physical dimension is going to be key in this fight
[2:57:35.080 --> 2:57:39.480]  folks again i'm not anti-trump i'm pro-trump i'm begging trump to do the right thing before it's
[2:57:39.480 --> 2:57:50.440]  too late we all need to be doing that aerodyne technology delivery system the first of its kind
[2:57:50.440 --> 2:57:57.160]  pure nascent atomic iodine that can be delivered through a spray bottle the next level of innovation
[2:57:57.160 --> 2:58:04.040]  of x2 is here introducing survival shield x2 spray the great part about the x2 spray is it's great
[2:58:04.040 --> 2:58:08.520]  on the go when you've got it in the dropper it's great at your house it's you know great at work
[2:58:08.520 --> 2:58:14.040]  but this is great for the car it's great to keep with you and again it's also good for the throat
[2:58:14.040 --> 2:58:19.160]  and mouth to get the effects of iodine not to just ingest it into the stomach we're really excited
[2:58:19.160 --> 2:58:24.920]  about it it's 33 off out of the gates it was listeners idea asking for us to come up with a
[2:58:24.920 --> 2:58:29.800]  spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes
[2:58:29.800 --> 2:58:34.600]  it and delivers it to the body in a new and in some ways even better way get your survival
[2:58:34.600 --> 2:58:42.280]  shield x2 nascent iodine spray now at 33 off at infowarstore.com and experience the power of aerosolized
[2:58:42.280 --> 2:58:54.440]  x2 nascent iodine for yourself

[3:01:05.320 --> 3:01:12.040]  it sums up a lot of things aside from just the issue at hand after today's trans rights decision
[3:01:12.040 --> 3:01:17.480]  from the supreme court the only employees you can fire without getting a lawsuit are young healthy
[3:01:17.480 --> 3:01:24.680]  heterosexual cis american white men or illegal aliens who can't sue choose carefully and making
[3:01:24.680 --> 3:01:32.200]  your hiring decisions she's right she's 100 right and any business owner knows how right she really
[3:01:32.200 --> 3:01:37.640]  is and i won't go into the weeds of the details of that but it's it's very true folks so uh you
[3:01:37.640 --> 3:01:44.040]  know we were told we'd be sick of winning gerald but uh a big loss two big losses today on the
[3:01:44.040 --> 3:01:48.760]  supreme court and uh democrat cities are being burned and looted to the to the ground but i
[3:01:48.760 --> 3:01:55.080]  guess maybe that is a victory so gerald salenti trendsresearch.com knock them out hey oh and thanks
[3:01:55.080 --> 3:02:01.560]  for having me on man good seeing you um you know let's let's start with the well we're just talking
[3:02:01.560 --> 3:02:08.760]  and just follow up with with our one a bit this is a time to unify i'm tired of this divided
[3:02:08.760 --> 3:02:19.400]  is a thing called the united states of america and what these neoliberal freaks have done is
[3:02:19.400 --> 3:02:29.080]  divided us we become the divided states of america and it's only going to get worse unless we
[3:02:29.080 --> 3:02:37.400]  reverse this trend you can see where it's going i was on a radio show recently and i really got
[3:02:37.400 --> 3:02:48.280]  blasted by the listeners because i said return in nazi state is taken over this place it passed
[3:02:48.280 --> 3:02:55.000]  in laws not laws regulations telling us what to do they're not even laws they've ripped up the
[3:02:55.000 --> 3:03:03.320]  constitution and the declaration of the uh bill of rights how dare i say nazi i'm not allowed to
[3:03:03.320 --> 3:03:13.240]  call king quomo a nazi maybe i could just call him a king this guy gives himself executive powers
[3:03:14.200 --> 3:03:16.280]  everybody better get this in their head
[3:03:19.000 --> 3:03:25.400]  this is the way it starts you think the nazis are throwing people into gas chambers
[3:03:25.400 --> 3:03:39.320]  and killing them right away now first they took power and then the people followed
[3:03:42.360 --> 3:03:52.840]  i've been to germany a couple of times new people whose parents fought in world war two
[3:03:52.840 --> 3:04:01.000]  they would never talk about it the parents the people were still ashamed that they followed
[3:04:01.000 --> 3:04:07.000]  hitler and that's why i bought these buildings on the most historic four corners in america in
[3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:14.680]  kingston when i came back from berlin on april 27 2012 i was looking to leave the country
[3:04:14.680 --> 3:04:20.840]  because obama disgusted me so much and i saw the way this country was going down with this
[3:04:20.840 --> 3:04:26.760]  lying Nobel piece of crap prize winner just starting wars and people following them
[3:04:28.440 --> 3:04:31.240]  and i bought the buildings because i realized they couldn't run away
[3:04:33.960 --> 3:04:39.560]  berlin was grander than paris before was bombed out and i spent a lot of time in france
[3:04:43.160 --> 3:04:47.800]  and i'm saying to myself how come the people didn't stop this every way you looked is
[3:04:47.800 --> 3:04:53.560]  new construction everywhere beautiful old building new construction why didn't they stop it
[3:04:53.560 --> 3:05:00.920]  it was going to come to an end how could they let a freak like hitler who charlie chaplin played
[3:05:00.920 --> 3:05:11.480]  better than he did destroy their country history's repeating itself just like the people hild hitler
[3:05:11.480 --> 3:05:22.200]  marched off from usalini and saluted stalin you see him right now wear that mask wear that mask
[3:05:25.320 --> 3:05:35.560]  masks are natural we were born to wear masks forget about all the research that comes out
[3:05:35.560 --> 3:05:43.000]  that talks about the problems of masks you could ignore it
[3:05:46.520 --> 3:05:49.320]  look at the cover of the last trends journal we have up there
[3:05:51.400 --> 3:05:53.640]  we got the baby jesus with a mask on
[3:05:53.640 --> 3:06:03.560]  on a lotus blossom with a mask on moses with a mask on you will obey your leader
[3:06:07.160 --> 3:06:12.440]  you will wear a mask you will socially distance you will live in fear
[3:06:12.440 --> 3:06:18.920]  here the same thing is happening
[3:06:21.240 --> 3:06:24.760]  this is how it happens get it in your head everybody
[3:06:28.600 --> 3:06:36.200]  everybody's bowing down to these lowlife slimy pieces of garbage crap
[3:06:36.200 --> 3:06:44.520]  that have locked us down and destroyed our economy and by the way that cover
[3:06:45.080 --> 3:06:51.880]  of the trends journal is another great work of art by anthony frida who does a lot of our work
[3:06:51.880 --> 3:06:59.960]  there they go kneel down obey this is a time to unite and on july 4th
[3:06:59.960 --> 3:07:06.440]  as every place is being closed down and no people are celebrating america
[3:07:08.440 --> 3:07:19.880]  we're holding a united for peace and freedom rally right here on the most historic four
[3:07:19.880 --> 3:07:27.240]  corners in america and judge napolitano has agreed to join us and others will be following
[3:07:27.240 --> 3:07:36.280]  if we don't unite we will be high on hitland we'll be marching to musolini
[3:07:38.600 --> 3:07:46.040]  and we'll be saluting stalin how could anybody with an ounce of self-respect
[3:07:47.560 --> 3:07:50.200]  follow the orders of these little freaks
[3:07:50.200 --> 3:07:59.960]  socially distance stay six feet apart when you're outside hey dumbbell i'd like to use another word
[3:08:00.920 --> 3:08:04.920]  the first word begins with an s ends with a t in the second word's head
[3:08:07.400 --> 3:08:14.360]  the wind blows everywhere oh there he is the s-head the dictates of america
[3:08:14.360 --> 3:08:19.320]  you're telling me six feet apart's gonna stop
[3:08:21.240 --> 3:08:24.680]  the wind yes salenti it stops at exactly
[3:08:27.240 --> 3:08:35.000]  six feet how dare you deny what i say garresome no better yet vaccinate them
[3:08:35.000 --> 3:08:44.120]  and that's where we're going they're gonna vaccinate us to death
[3:08:44.120 --> 3:08:49.720]  the united states is not communist china we don't have three million people in concentration camps
[3:08:49.720 --> 3:08:55.560]  we don't blow up churches we don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs but all of the
[3:08:55.560 --> 3:09:03.160]  news we see the un billable indicates who mainstream corporate media praising communist china for
[3:09:03.160 --> 3:09:08.280]  their response and if communist china shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses
[3:09:08.280 --> 3:09:13.160]  and has robots controlling people well then gee we've got to do that and on top of it cities like
[3:09:13.160 --> 3:09:18.840]  san antonio pass laws saying will arrest you if you say chinese virus well now qualmo in new york's
[3:09:18.840 --> 3:09:24.600]  calling it the european virus these people are out of control control freaks and they are gonna
[3:09:24.600 --> 3:09:29.800]  lose big time because we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them
[3:09:29.800 --> 3:09:35.800]  in their power grab the resistance lives at bandot video and info wars dot com spread those
[3:09:35.800 --> 3:09:40.760]  links and jam it down the censors throats and then we'll be able to defeat their operation that much
[3:09:40.760 --> 3:09:47.560]  quicker one of our best-selling products is living defense and it's been sold out for over four months
[3:09:47.560 --> 3:09:51.720]  because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic we've got a limited supply right now
[3:09:51.720 --> 3:09:55.560]  but it's selling out fast and i want those of you that have it experienced living defense
[3:09:55.560 --> 3:10:00.360]  to get it for yourself here's just part of one testimonial i looked in january 2016 i went in
[3:10:00.360 --> 3:10:05.240]  a hospital i went to va hospital out here in boise and i was in there until june and one of the only
[3:10:05.240 --> 3:10:10.840]  things that got me through that ordeal was listening to info wars three hours a day and i kept here in
[3:10:10.840 --> 3:10:15.960]  dr group and all you guys talking about living defense let me tell you something i had an internal
[3:10:15.960 --> 3:10:21.160]  digestive problem and i stumbled with it for about five or six years and the doctors they tried every
[3:10:21.160 --> 3:10:25.560]  step nobody could figure out what it is and then every day when i kept hearing you and dr group
[3:10:25.560 --> 3:10:29.160]  and those commercials i said you know what i'm gonna get me some of that freaking living defense
[3:10:29.160 --> 3:10:32.360]  now i wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have a stuff but
[3:10:32.360 --> 3:10:37.400]  i ordered it had it shipped to me i got it i hid it from the nurses i started taking it man that
[3:10:37.400 --> 3:10:42.600]  stuff changed my life it saved my life alex jones and info wars saved my life
[3:10:42.600 --> 3:10:48.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:10:48.760 --> 3:10:58.920]  so
[3:10:58.920 --> 3:11:16.680]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show with gerald salente
[3:11:16.680 --> 3:11:26.760]  hello hello great being on the alex jones show so this
[3:11:28.360 --> 3:11:38.120]  covid 19 fear and hysteria has robbed our nation of its liberty and freedom
[3:11:38.120 --> 3:11:46.760]  and that's what we're fighting to restore and that's what our rally is going to be it's going to
[3:11:46.760 --> 3:11:56.440]  start at 3 p.m up here in kingston if they try to stop me because you're not allowed to have rallies
[3:11:56.440 --> 3:12:08.760]  i will fight if black lives matter if me too matters you're going to tell me i can't rally
[3:12:11.560 --> 3:12:19.480]  for peace and freedom and to unite us all and judge napolitano knows that as well
[3:12:19.480 --> 3:12:29.640]  well if they could protest we're not protesting we're rallying this is the fourth of july
[3:12:31.240 --> 3:12:38.360]  and i'm proud to be an american not proud of the politicians that destroyed the country but
[3:12:38.360 --> 3:12:46.200]  proud of the constitution and the declaration of independence so it brings us back to covid
[3:12:46.200 --> 3:12:54.040]  because this is the one that's really brought us down this is unprecedented in world history
[3:12:54.040 --> 3:13:00.200]  there will be no economic recovery it's only going to get worse so there's going to be a
[3:13:00.200 --> 3:13:09.000]  little bounce back isn't it fun to go out and go to a restaurant with people wearing masks
[3:13:09.000 --> 3:13:16.520]  as they're serving you and all these stupid rules that you have how moronic can it be when you go
[3:13:16.520 --> 3:13:21.480]  into someplace and there's a shield in front of the person in front of you at the cashier
[3:13:22.440 --> 3:13:29.240]  but yet the sides are open all around them why not why don't we just be in bubbles wouldn't that be
[3:13:29.240 --> 3:13:41.640]  better you think people are going to be flying again you got to wear a mask on the trip oh and
[3:13:41.640 --> 3:13:51.160]  isn't it fun for someone to take your temperature how about that an invasion of our personal rights
[3:13:51.160 --> 3:13:57.880]  this isn't the constitution or the bill of rights they've robbed it from us
[3:14:00.520 --> 3:14:07.240]  little kids they take their temperature now going to back to uh daycare
[3:14:10.600 --> 3:14:17.400]  and now little kids wearing masks so now they're being programmed for fear i mentioned about and
[3:14:17.400 --> 3:14:22.920]  again we wrote about it in detail in the trends journal about the dangers of wearing masks
[3:14:25.720 --> 3:14:31.640]  and but that's not the way they promote it like an article i pulled from the hill
[3:14:32.360 --> 3:14:42.680]  on june 13th masks now seen as vital tool in coronavirus fight evidence is mounting
[3:14:42.680 --> 3:14:49.400]  that widespread mask wearing can significantly slow the spread of coronavirus
[3:14:50.200 --> 3:14:53.720]  and help reduce the need for further lockdowns
[3:14:58.200 --> 3:15:02.520]  and who do they quote only the people that support it
[3:15:02.520 --> 3:15:15.800]  one after another they don't quote Dr. Russell Baylock who warns that not only do face masks
[3:15:15.800 --> 3:15:24.280]  fail to protect the healthy from getting sick but they also create serious health risks to the wearer
[3:15:24.280 --> 3:15:31.800]  the bottom line is that if you're not sick you should not wear a face mask
[3:15:37.720 --> 3:15:43.560]  one after another study after study showing the dangers of wearing these
[3:15:43.560 --> 3:15:53.320]  masks but the sheeple of bored into it and this is what i'm saying this is bigger than COVID
[3:15:54.520 --> 3:15:57.320]  this is about robbing us of our rights and freedom
[3:16:00.760 --> 3:16:02.200]  and you got the imbeciles
[3:16:05.880 --> 3:16:09.960]  spreading fear and hysteria who they quote the most
[3:16:09.960 --> 3:16:16.360]  this is from our trends journal a trend post that we just did
[3:16:17.880 --> 3:16:26.840]  i want to put this in perspective the 1957 58 influenza pandemic also known as the Asian flu
[3:16:28.120 --> 3:16:30.760]  killed some 1 million people worldwide
[3:16:30.760 --> 3:16:41.960]  hmm how many people are killed so far now oh about 400 i think in what 14 000 or something like that
[3:16:44.840 --> 3:16:49.480]  at that time the world's population was about three billion people
[3:16:51.080 --> 3:16:55.720]  one million dead out of three billion is 0.033 percent
[3:16:55.720 --> 3:17:09.000]  now with COVID the population is 7.8 billion it's 0.0051 percent
[3:17:10.680 --> 3:17:13.240]  so it didn't close down the country back then
[3:17:17.880 --> 3:17:21.320]  so if COVID 19 was as deadly as the Asian flu
[3:17:21.320 --> 3:17:33.000]  with today's population is 7.8 billion people using the same percentages 0.033 from
[3:17:33.000 --> 3:17:40.920]  back in 57 58 what did i say about 414 000 people are dead
[3:17:40.920 --> 3:17:52.040]  not 434 000 here we go if you use the same equation we'd have two million six hundred
[3:17:52.040 --> 3:17:54.840]  thousand people dead all right
[3:17:57.800 --> 3:18:03.480]  this is not the deadly pandemic that they're selling it to be by the numbers i'm only going
[3:18:03.480 --> 3:18:12.600]  by the numbers and the other facts the facts are that when you look at international data
[3:18:14.200 --> 3:18:18.600]  and national data and we'll go with the low numbers to national data
[3:18:20.280 --> 3:18:27.240]  about 42 percent of the people that have died in america are from nursing homes
[3:18:27.240 --> 3:18:36.760]  all right so now subtract that number
[3:18:39.320 --> 3:18:42.440]  from the 114 000 that had died in america
[3:18:46.120 --> 3:18:51.640]  again it's more than a third the latest study we have it out now new trends journal
[3:18:51.640 --> 3:19:01.160]  it's 42 percent at the minimum so it's going to be get again the numbers add up to nothing
[3:19:04.040 --> 3:19:05.560]  considering a population
[3:19:07.800 --> 3:19:15.640]  of 330 million people the other victims are obese diabetics people suffering from lung
[3:19:15.640 --> 3:19:22.760]  disease smoking and heart ailments so what are we talking about
[3:19:24.920 --> 3:19:31.240]  nothing in real terms and yet they destroyed our liberty love joy and beauty
[3:19:32.920 --> 3:19:38.920]  and remember you have to do all you can to support info wars to keep truth alive
[3:19:38.920 --> 3:19:45.480]  i was talking to my patron supplier great suppliers you can now say four weeks on average
[3:19:45.480 --> 3:19:51.160]  for storable food it's the highest quality they've got it use this little rest we have
[3:19:51.160 --> 3:19:55.160]  caught in the current to come up to the service get some air before you get stuck back down
[3:19:55.160 --> 3:20:00.440]  i personally am ordering more storable food i have to now start going into defense posture
[3:20:00.440 --> 3:20:05.560]  80 percent's offense but i've always been 100 percent offense trying to fully you know stop the
[3:20:05.560 --> 3:20:09.320]  globless i mean giving them a good run and i think down the road they'll be defeated but
[3:20:10.520 --> 3:20:15.240]  we're gonna still go down the hard road now there were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down but

[3:39:36.040 --> 3:39:43.080]  diabetics i want to stay with this corona virus you know the media says the corona virus causes
[3:39:43.080 --> 3:39:47.240]  all you know the corona virus didn't cause these problems the politicians cause them they always
[3:39:47.240 --> 3:39:54.760]  say as a result of the corona virus no again i read you the information from the 1957 58
[3:39:55.400 --> 3:40:01.480]  asian flu where a million people died of a population of 3 million people we have about
[3:40:01.480 --> 3:40:08.920]  434 000 dead out of population of 7.7 billion oh and then another very important factor
[3:40:08.920 --> 3:40:18.920]  extremely important factor the numbers are cooked dr john lee argues that the way the numbers are
[3:40:18.920 --> 3:40:27.000]  being counted is quote a national scandal and quote as positive tests are not required for
[3:40:27.000 --> 3:40:33.400]  deaths to be registered as a result of coven 19 furthermore the guidance has been issued
[3:40:33.400 --> 3:40:41.720]  to reduce the number of autopsies when autopsies are more important than ever so there you go
[3:40:42.600 --> 3:40:50.040]  then you look at some of the other facts and this is going to be also in our trans journal
[3:40:50.040 --> 3:41:03.640]  which goes out tomorrow it was a story in march 11th in cmbc up to 150 million americans are
[3:41:03.640 --> 3:41:14.120]  expected to contract the corona virus you know it says this man when it top exploits congressional
[3:41:14.120 --> 3:41:23.400]  doctor dr brian monahan the attending physician of congress and the united states supreme court
[3:41:24.280 --> 3:41:30.200]  so he expects up to 150 million people in the united states will become infected
[3:41:31.400 --> 3:41:42.440]  with coven 19 nbc reported so you start looking at that data where did i put it here
[3:41:42.440 --> 3:41:47.960]  and it really doesn't add up to much because
[3:41:50.920 --> 3:41:58.120]  if 150 million people had it were infected in the united states
[3:42:00.040 --> 3:42:08.440]  and you had a 1 percent which they average out to be the people that die to get it that would mean
[3:42:08.440 --> 3:42:18.920]  we have 1.5 million people in the united states that have died of the virus correct according to
[3:42:20.120 --> 3:42:24.840]  dr monahan or is it dr han job
[3:42:27.880 --> 3:42:33.800]  how come they're not calling this guy out oh he's an expert so lenty he is a government man
[3:42:33.800 --> 3:42:39.160]  you are only a worker on the plantation of slave landia
[3:42:43.080 --> 3:42:43.800]  you got it
[3:42:48.440 --> 3:42:50.680]  150 million cases
[3:42:53.480 --> 3:42:54.520]  they're saying that
[3:42:54.520 --> 3:43:00.920]  that the effects are mostly
[3:43:03.640 --> 3:43:12.280]  1 percent will die to get it so therefore we should now have 1.5 million people dead
[3:43:15.000 --> 3:43:18.520]  rather than 116 thousand
[3:43:18.520 --> 3:43:31.640]  and again that 116 thousand number is inflated by fact the census of disease control changed
[3:43:32.360 --> 3:43:39.800]  in their forms that you didn't have to take a test they got to be suspected
[3:43:41.320 --> 3:43:46.840]  go to go to a trial and say well we suspected it do you have any proof no we suspected that
[3:43:46.840 --> 3:43:53.800]  we didn't need to do any proof don't you know who we are we don't need proof all we have to do is
[3:43:53.800 --> 3:44:01.240]  say what we want to say and you will believe us so what else do we got here
[3:44:04.760 --> 3:44:11.480]  up to 80 percent of all test positive persons remain symptom free that's another one
[3:44:11.480 --> 3:44:17.480]  even among 70 to 79 year olds these are all data coming out
[3:44:24.120 --> 3:44:31.800]  this imbecilic forecast made by a government flak again we should have actually the numbers
[3:44:31.800 --> 3:44:36.120]  should be 1,382,000 people should have died
[3:44:36.120 --> 3:44:42.760]  or have died would have died if you if you he was all that's how much he was off
[3:44:43.720 --> 3:44:49.160]  because he said 1.5 million would die so what would the numbers I did this one before the
[3:44:49.160 --> 3:44:55.800]  last number came out he was only 1,382,000 off that doesn't count
[3:44:55.800 --> 3:45:05.240]  the median age of the deceased in most countries including Italy is 80 years old
[3:45:09.240 --> 3:45:14.280]  and only about four percent of the deceased had no serious preconditions
[3:45:14.280 --> 3:45:22.760]  but yet they've locked down our entire economy this is not coming back
[3:45:26.920 --> 3:45:34.200]  deal reached a supply millions of vaccine doses italy's health minister on saturday
[3:45:35.720 --> 3:45:43.000]  stated that the european vaccine alliance formed this month by his country france germany and the
[3:45:43.000 --> 3:45:51.800]  netherlands had struck a deal with britain based drug company astrazeneca to supply you ready for this
[3:45:54.200 --> 3:45:57.320]  up to 400 million doses
[3:45:59.880 --> 3:46:08.120]  of a corona virus vaccine 400 million doses
[3:46:08.120 --> 3:46:11.480]  how many people is european
[3:46:13.640 --> 3:46:15.240]  take around 400 million
[3:46:19.240 --> 3:46:21.400]  they're going to force us to get vaccinated
[3:46:24.520 --> 3:46:26.920]  that'll be the death camp they will put us into
[3:46:26.920 --> 3:46:37.800]  so this is nazism communism hitler's style and musolini all wrapped up into one
[3:46:41.400 --> 3:46:42.840]  you can see where this is heading
[3:46:45.560 --> 3:46:51.560]  we need to unite for peace and liberty we have to restore the liberty that's been taken away from us
[3:46:51.560 --> 3:46:57.480]  so please do what you can to join us on july 4th at the four corners of freedom
[3:46:58.360 --> 3:47:01.800]  the only place of pre-revolutionary warstone buildings on each corner

[3:47:08.520 --> 3:47:14.360]  because i couldn't be me if i was born anywhere else and i will fight for freedom i am a warrior
