[00:00.000 --> 00:23.160]  1-1-8, 1-1-8, and that's not Hunter Bosser.
[00:23.160 --> 00:28.080]  That's how long we are out from the election.
[00:28.080 --> 00:40.720]  But if you think this is being done to just get rid of Trump, think again.
[00:40.720 --> 00:42.680]  All of this has been pre-planned.
[00:42.680 --> 00:47.560]  We told you exactly what they would do with it in the rollout, and they're doing it.
[00:47.560 --> 00:49.360]  They're shutting the world economy down.
[00:49.360 --> 00:52.560]  They're going to kill billions in the next decade.
[00:52.560 --> 00:54.400]  Billions will die.
[00:54.400 --> 00:59.360]  So all you big leftists and folks that are in the depopulation, you are definitely going
[00:59.360 --> 01:00.360]  to get everything you want.
[01:00.360 --> 01:08.400]  It's going to happen to you as well, but you'll be positronically and chemically lobotomized
[01:08.400 --> 01:11.800]  long before they suck your soul out.
[01:11.800 --> 01:13.160]  So you want dystopia?
[01:13.160 --> 01:15.160]  You got it.
[01:15.160 --> 01:20.640]  Now, the good news is we're going to see a lot of rejection of this whole new world
[01:20.640 --> 01:29.200]  water system, and a big awake thing is taking place, and we are starting to turn the corner
[01:29.200 --> 01:34.440]  when it comes to a particular nasty club of deep staters that are trying to cause a civil
[01:34.440 --> 01:36.880]  war in our country.
[01:36.880 --> 01:46.960]  But long-term, if they're not routed out and prosecuted for their criminal operations
[01:46.960 --> 01:53.520]  just by attrition, they're going to win by shutting down civilization.
[01:53.520 --> 02:01.200]  You knew the next call was going to be Silicon Valley that started the lockdown and shut
[02:01.200 --> 02:07.240]  down their companies first, then followed by the entertainment industry and created the
[02:07.240 --> 02:11.320]  domino effect to make it look like Trump had to shut everything down, or he was killing
[02:11.320 --> 02:15.520]  people, all the fake numbers and all the rest of propaganda.
[02:15.520 --> 02:22.680]  Silicon Valley is now announcing that they're basically never reopening, and that you'll
[02:22.680 --> 02:27.000]  all quote work from home as you're being taught to be obsolete.
[02:27.000 --> 02:32.160]  And now, following suit, California school districts in Silicon Valley leading the way
[02:32.160 --> 02:35.600]  are announcing that they're never going back to school.
[02:35.600 --> 02:41.560]  And Austin is following that model, and the AISD and also the Westlake schools, they have
[02:41.560 --> 02:46.520]  just gotten rid of grades basically, or you can take whatever semester you had your highest
[02:46.520 --> 02:49.320]  grades and then that is applied and doubled.
[02:49.320 --> 02:52.720]  I mean, this is two plus two equals five.
[02:52.720 --> 02:54.960]  This is ending education by design.
[02:54.960 --> 02:57.680]  It was always the plan.
[02:57.680 --> 03:01.840]  This is how you create serve all slaves is dumbing them down, destroying the work ethic
[03:01.840 --> 03:06.040]  so that robots have to come in and do the work, further displacing humans because humans
[03:06.040 --> 03:12.080]  are so dysfunctional, so mentally ill, and start so many crazy fights with each other
[03:12.080 --> 03:15.960]  that we are dysfunctional was a big article out about that yesterday I meant to get to
[03:15.960 --> 03:17.680]  you guys pull out a stack.
[03:17.680 --> 03:19.160]  Big study just came out.
[03:19.160 --> 03:24.840]  There's a whole bunch of these but how leftist, again, are more likely to steal more likely
[03:24.840 --> 03:31.120]  to lie, and that they claim they're trying to help the office or the military or whatever
[03:31.120 --> 03:36.480]  the institution is, but they will destroy it.
[03:36.480 --> 03:44.840]  And they're just knitting spoiled brainwashed brats who are being prepared to be pushed
[03:44.840 --> 03:49.120]  into the fire, not by us, but by the globalist.
[03:49.120 --> 03:54.240]  But then when you look at the engineers of this thing to a person, they're into dehumanizing
[03:54.240 --> 03:56.400]  and pedophilia.
[03:56.400 --> 03:58.120]  They're just obsessed with hurting innocent.
[03:58.120 --> 04:03.480]  So they're not setting up some survival of the fittest thing to get rid of the useless
[04:03.480 --> 04:04.480]  eaters.
[04:04.480 --> 04:13.800]  They are setting up a charnel house of just out of control experiments and degradation.
[04:13.800 --> 04:20.160]  Experiments in just a mad scientist's torture chamber, hell hole on a planetary intergalactic
[04:20.160 --> 04:23.520]  scale, just hell on earth.
[04:23.520 --> 04:29.160]  But let me tell you, some of the big news when we come back from break here, there is
[04:29.160 --> 04:32.640]  a lot of it.
[04:32.640 --> 04:37.400]  And we now, well, we've always known what's going on, but now it's really confirmed.
[04:37.400 --> 04:41.000]  We know the exact shape of it, how the new world order is going to come in everybody,
[04:41.000 --> 04:44.120]  and where we're going to go from here.
[04:44.120 --> 04:49.000]  But remember, they're going to keep the death of the third world quiet until it totally
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.040]  collapses and over floods us, and that's the plan they're about to carry out.
[04:53.040 --> 04:58.960]  So a lot of folks are dying right now, starving to death, so I hope you're left to pride yourself.
[04:58.960 --> 05:02.760]  The fourth of July, 2020 special has gone into high gear.
[05:02.760 --> 05:09.160]  We have 50% off, body's really strong extractive tumorate formula, it's been sold out for months,
[05:09.160 --> 05:10.160]  that's back in stock.
[05:10.160 --> 05:14.760]  DNA Force Plus with the PQQ, the CoQ10, so good for yourself, so amazing, that's back
[05:14.760 --> 05:16.160]  in stock 50% off.
[05:16.160 --> 05:20.600]  Winter Sun's been sold out for over three months, it's back in stock, pure, high quality

[05:26.120 --> 05:27.120]  That's back in stock.

[05:35.560 --> 05:40.120]  So I want to thank you all this July 4th coming up for standing with us, and I want to invite
[05:40.120 --> 05:43.720]  you to take advantage of these great deals and great products that enrich yourself and
[05:43.720 --> 05:46.920]  your family's life, and also fund hardcore truth.
[05:46.920 --> 05:52.120]  Again, take action, big 4th of July sales right now at infoworkstore.com, we could not
[05:52.120 --> 05:56.480]  have done this without you, and I thank you for your continued prayer, your focus, and
[05:56.480 --> 05:57.480]  your support.
[05:57.480 --> 06:19.800]  Again, I salute you all.
[06:19.800 --> 06:28.000]  It is July 7th on this Tuesday transmission, 118 out from the election, I'm your host
[06:28.000 --> 06:33.280]  Alex Jones, thank you so much for joining us.
[06:33.280 --> 06:40.880]  Well I am sitting here not looking at the blueprints of world government and planetary
[06:40.880 --> 06:50.080]  deindustrialization and depopulation, I'm now looking at the new world order field marshal's
[06:50.080 --> 06:53.120]  plans in motion.
[06:53.120 --> 07:02.080]  You know, Hitler had Operation Barbarossa to invade, Russia already drawn up in 1938,
[07:02.080 --> 07:07.080]  but it wasn't for what, three years or so until they did that.
[07:07.080 --> 07:12.520]  But it's one thing to have something on paper, it's another thing to actually launch it,
[07:12.520 --> 07:18.200]  kind of like we had the atomic bomb plans, and weren't sure they were going to work
[07:18.200 --> 07:22.720]  until we detonated them out in the desert in Nevada and then dropped them on Hiroshima
[07:22.720 --> 07:31.840]  and Nagasaki a few months later, nothing like a live test.
[07:31.840 --> 07:39.600]  So I'm almost speechless right now, the news and information is so profound, the only way
[07:39.600 --> 07:44.280]  I can do this is just tell you the news we have coming up and then try to do the best
[07:44.280 --> 07:48.520]  job I can to go through each stack of this.
[07:48.520 --> 07:53.120]  If you remember in 1984 they had the telescreens that watch you, listen to you, and also park
[07:53.120 --> 07:59.000]  orders at you, that is now official.
[07:59.000 --> 08:03.400]  And they're not just going to take over your TV or your cell phone, but they are going
[08:03.400 --> 08:10.200]  to take over your refrigerators, everything is now having microphones and cameras and
[08:10.200 --> 08:13.720]  speakers put at them, because everything is going to be barking orders at you and surveilling
[08:13.720 --> 08:14.720]  you.
[08:14.720 --> 08:19.000]  You're not just going to get governmental text messages and corporate advisement, but
[08:19.000 --> 08:26.960]  everything from Apple to Spotify to Google, everything is going to bark orders at you
[08:26.960 --> 08:27.960]  everywhere you go.
[08:27.960 --> 08:31.440]  All of those places are going to be digital, they'll be barking orders, billboards are
[08:31.440 --> 08:35.120]  being bought up by the corporations to be digital, they'll bark orders, they also spy
[08:35.120 --> 08:38.320]  on you with different devices.
[08:38.320 --> 08:45.560]  It is a completely hellish dystopia being built by the bad guys to suppress and control
[08:45.560 --> 08:52.760]  humanity and bring us into the kill grid.
[08:52.760 --> 08:58.160]  Fortnite obviously has 50, 100 million, who knows, players on it, one of the biggest video
[08:58.160 --> 09:05.280]  games in the world, multiplayer games, and now CNN is force fed onto that, whereas players
[09:05.280 --> 09:08.600]  could talk to each other and go around and live in this fantasy land, you think you were
[09:08.600 --> 09:12.240]  just given fantasy lands, you'd sit there and eat hot pockets all day, no.
[09:12.240 --> 09:18.280]  You were addicted to this fantasy land because now you're learning it's a roach motel and
[09:18.280 --> 09:22.520]  roaches go in, they don't go out.
[09:22.520 --> 09:28.080]  And so every media must be pumped full of race war, pumped full of disinfo.
[09:28.080 --> 09:34.360]  Now it turns out that players across the board, whether they be black or white, almost universally
[09:34.360 --> 09:42.840]  began attacking the big jumbo screen reeducation camp brainwashing systems.
[09:42.840 --> 09:49.800]  If you're watching this on TV right now, read all those stories that's up on inforwars.com.
[09:49.800 --> 09:55.120]  This is directly out of a Soviet or a Chinese style reeducation camp.
[09:55.120 --> 10:03.560]  Oh, they had drive in theaters in communist China, but not the type that we had.
[10:03.560 --> 10:08.280]  You get locked up at the local sports stadium and they sit there and Blair, sometimes 24
[10:08.280 --> 10:15.560]  hours a day, messages about how you need to accept reeducation, you need to decry those
[10:15.560 --> 10:19.080]  that haven't fully submitted, you need to say what you've done wrong, you need to promise
[10:19.080 --> 10:20.980]  what you're going to do for the party.
[10:20.980 --> 10:29.240]  This is a dystopic blueprint being run on us because it's worked everywhere else.
[10:29.240 --> 10:37.600]  I mean, we're being marched in to a collective extermination grid.
[10:37.600 --> 10:41.480]  Seen the film, the Nazis hurting men, women and children into pets to shoot them and then
[10:41.480 --> 10:45.560]  to have bulldozers cover them up, ever seen all that execution footage?
[10:45.560 --> 10:50.040]  Well, that's what we're all being hurted into, folks, and they're cutting off your food,
[10:50.040 --> 10:52.640]  your water, your medicine, your mobility, everything.
[10:52.640 --> 10:54.880]  And it's not going to end if Trump gets out of office.
[10:54.880 --> 11:02.720]  It's only going to get worse because this is a giant, total, complete, corporate model.
[11:02.720 --> 11:07.840]  So imagine, you don't just get force fed CNN at the airport or force fed CNN at the
[11:07.840 --> 11:11.280]  bar or the train station.
[11:11.280 --> 11:16.160]  Now you have to watch it because it's going to come over your phone with alerts.
[11:16.160 --> 11:21.120]  It's going to be forced onto your video game, TV screens.
[11:21.120 --> 11:24.680]  And now they're saying, oh, if you're mean to the messages and don't listen to them,
[11:24.680 --> 11:26.600]  you're going to be punished.
[11:26.600 --> 11:27.600]  That's right.
[11:27.600 --> 11:38.400]  You're not allowed to be on your fortnight unless you submit to Van Jones telling you
[11:38.400 --> 11:45.840]  that white people are inherently bad when the most evil globalist corporations of planets
[11:45.840 --> 11:51.520]  ever seen own Time Warner, own CNN.
[11:51.520 --> 11:56.040]  I mean, CNN won't say a word about three million Muslims and death camps or millions of Christians
[11:56.040 --> 11:57.640]  and slave labor camps in China.
[11:57.640 --> 11:58.880]  They love it.
[11:58.880 --> 12:00.640]  Silicon Valley loves it.
[12:00.640 --> 12:07.640]  They're authoritarians and they're going, oh, this is for black people.
[12:07.640 --> 12:12.080]  You're hijacking all your screens and pumping race war narrative and that America sucks
[12:12.080 --> 12:16.560]  and that black people are about trans people makes no sense.
[12:16.560 --> 12:27.120]  So you must support helping black men have their penises cut off because we're helping.
[12:27.120 --> 12:28.760]  This is your science fiction movie, folks.
[12:28.760 --> 12:35.400]  You're in the dystopia and they're going to force you to watch them force you to look
[12:35.400 --> 12:40.800]  at them while they censor everybody else and then while they lie about everybody else.
[12:40.800 --> 12:42.400]  So medical doctors are that's good.
[12:42.400 --> 12:43.400]  I can't look anymore.
[12:43.400 --> 12:44.400]  Thanks.
[12:44.400 --> 12:49.400]  Medical doctors with major hospitals, major clinics come out and show COVID-19 and exaggerated
[12:49.400 --> 12:50.400]  Oaks.
[12:50.400 --> 12:51.760]  They get banned on YouTube.
[12:51.760 --> 13:00.160]  But Van Jones is pushed at the top of Google, top of Twitter, everywhere and now force fed
[13:00.160 --> 13:05.800]  onto your video game.
[13:05.800 --> 13:09.720]  So remember, we were worried about surveillance cameras 25 years ago and how they'd be hooked
[13:09.720 --> 13:13.760]  into these grids and try to control you and I made films and warned you about how they
[13:13.760 --> 13:15.280]  would hijack the devices.
[13:15.280 --> 13:21.120]  Now big corporations would do it and now you're here and it's like, oh, they're doing it because
[13:21.120 --> 13:22.120]  of COVID.
[13:22.120 --> 13:26.200]  Remember a few months ago, oh, we're hijacking all your computers, your TVs for COVID and
[13:26.200 --> 13:32.520]  oh, at the top of all the playlist on Apple Music and Spotify and YouTube, we have what
[13:32.520 --> 13:36.760]  we call a blackout where we only show you communist revolutionary black music, how to
[13:36.760 --> 13:39.960]  kill the police, how to do all this.
[13:39.960 --> 13:47.400]  And now it's like, oh, and now we're going to force feed a whole race war channel that
[13:47.400 --> 13:53.560]  CNN separately producing right onto your TV screens to radicalize people sitting there
[13:53.560 --> 13:58.000]  playing their Fortnite, the average age is about 13.
[13:58.000 --> 14:05.240]  So your child while you're busy watching Netflix, your child is being brainwashed by
[14:05.240 --> 14:08.360]  Van Jones.
[14:08.360 --> 14:12.360]  Here's the thing though, I don't really want to interrupt my enemy when they are destroying
[14:12.360 --> 14:14.800]  themselves according to Bonaparte.
[14:14.800 --> 14:19.280]  This I could have told them would have spectacular backlash, but see, they know that they don't
[14:19.280 --> 14:20.280]  care.
[14:20.280 --> 14:26.040]  They press and press and press and press and censor the ADLs come in and said we run Sony,
[14:26.040 --> 14:32.600]  we run Microsoft, we have partnerships with all the video game platforms.
[14:32.600 --> 14:36.640]  We're going to control what you can say and do and they're banning the okay sign now from
[14:36.640 --> 14:41.840]  the military games, just sign language, international, okay, move forward, everybody knows what
[14:41.840 --> 14:42.840]  all that means.
[14:42.840 --> 14:45.560]  Thumbs up, they're now saying the racist term.
[14:45.560 --> 14:53.800]  So literally this international spy organization, the ADL, is now the thought police partnered,
[14:53.800 --> 14:58.560]  oh, and they called Stefan Molyneux a white supremacist.
[14:58.560 --> 15:03.240]  They put out a list of thousands of people that they say are white supremacists and so
[15:03.240 --> 15:04.640]  he was taken off YouTube.
[15:04.640 --> 15:06.800]  See how it works?
[15:06.800 --> 15:13.320]  Because Mr. Greenblatt is God and now controls your TV screen.
[15:13.320 --> 15:18.680]  Your outer limits, that old 60s show, we control the vertical, we control the horizontal.
[15:18.680 --> 15:24.440]  Well, your TV doesn't just track what you watch and what you do now, it barks, orders
[15:24.440 --> 15:25.440]  at you.
[15:25.440 --> 15:30.760]  And notice this is all moving very quickly, it's all moving very, very quickly.
[15:30.760 --> 15:34.800]  Now we're just suddenly, it's going to be on everything constantly, just screens like
[15:34.800 --> 15:38.200]  Minority Report, you're walking through, they're face scanning, they know who you are, they're
[15:38.200 --> 15:41.320]  directing moms, and then the malice youth brigades.
[15:41.320 --> 15:49.280]  Oh yes, they're now raiding churches, attacking people under de Blasio's command.
[15:49.280 --> 15:53.080]  Wait till we cover this and it's all modeled off of communist China.
[15:53.080 --> 15:56.360]  We'll show you the documents when we return.
[15:56.360 --> 16:02.560]  2020 is a very special year to the globalist, to the occultist, to those that are into esoteric
[16:02.560 --> 16:06.480]  mysticism and they believe this is the year they're going to totally overthrow America

[17:59.120 --> 18:06.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:06.120 --> 18:28.120]  I'm your host Alex Jones, thank you for joining us as we discuss the destiny of humanity and
[18:28.120 --> 18:31.800]  the great choices we have before us on this planet.
[18:31.800 --> 18:39.720]  Alright, let's get into the operating system of this, the Communist Chinese took a lot
[18:39.720 --> 18:45.920]  of models that the Imperial Chinese and the Mandarin and the legalists and others had
[18:45.920 --> 18:53.760]  developed over several thousand years and just basic torture they learned from the Huns
[18:53.760 --> 19:03.800]  and many others and they fused it with a lot of western torture techniques and a lot of
[19:03.800 --> 19:11.720]  the techniques that they were taught by the psychiatric systems of the world and other
[19:11.720 --> 19:17.840]  authoritarian regimes and so if you read back in the 50s and 60s the CIA that had really
[19:17.840 --> 19:21.840]  secretly helped put Mao Zedong into power said oh we've got to study all this torture
[19:21.840 --> 19:26.520]  and all this mind control because the Mandarin's are doing it, the Communist Chinese are doing
[19:26.520 --> 19:31.600]  it and they're able to actually create Manchurian candidates for you at that term, we have to
[19:31.600 --> 19:36.040]  be able to beat that so that was their excuse to have those projects was to study it just
[19:36.040 --> 19:43.280]  like they'll create all these new bio weapons to have a cure for them.
[19:43.280 --> 19:50.080]  And so when you look at the operating system as I've told you many times of Black Lives
[19:50.080 --> 19:56.600]  Matter and of what's unfolding we've been studying Antifa and refused fascism controlled
[19:56.600 --> 20:04.720]  by Soros and others and it is a Maoist group that they will tell you we follow Mao's plan
[20:04.720 --> 20:09.480]  and what they do is they hype the young people up and the government, the media promote it
[20:09.480 --> 20:16.760]  and say they're revolutionary but the establishment directing the mob of young people to go out
[20:16.760 --> 20:21.680]  and beat people up, attack people and then even kill them and then so it's not the state
[20:21.680 --> 20:28.600]  doing it oh no it's the quote young people that have been turned loose now one facet
[20:28.600 --> 20:35.560]  of this gets into the Communist Chinese and one of their systems of control and it's interchangeable
[20:35.560 --> 20:39.080]  with European schools of torture and psychology as well I mean a lot of this is just putting
[20:39.080 --> 20:49.200]  you into a Stockholm syndrome weren't helplessness position but I want to go to this report and
[20:49.200 --> 20:54.400]  then when we come back I want to show TV viewers and talk about it for radio listeners photos
[20:54.400 --> 21:01.720]  here and documents about what happened in the 50s and 60s and 70s and the tens of millions
[21:01.720 --> 21:07.680]  that were killed by people on average the age of 12 and let me tell you know you got
[21:07.680 --> 21:12.320]  50 schoolgirls come in your house and butcher knives I mean they're gonna kill you not the
[21:12.320 --> 21:15.880]  women don't know how to kill people it's just that when they do get into it it's it's like
[21:15.880 --> 21:21.240]  a absolutely savage insane foaming at the mouth just murder murder murder that's what
[21:21.240 --> 21:25.680]  they're winding up right now so you notice she's the leader she's the girl you know she's
[21:25.680 --> 21:29.400]  she's 10 years old she's gonna kill you look at this one oh look how happy they are all
[21:29.400 --> 21:34.000]  the power they've got killing people every day kill kill kill they're just nice little
[21:34.000 --> 21:40.560]  girls kill kill kill kill kill when you go out to these events you see the hate in the
[21:40.560 --> 21:47.040]  eyes man so the communist Chinese that have 3 million Muslims and death camps and millions
[21:47.040 --> 21:50.520]  of Christians and slave camps and death camps there are a model of black lives matter they're
[21:50.520 --> 21:55.400]  the good guys because they hate black people the communists particularly but China is very
[21:55.400 --> 22:00.560]  very racist oh look at this here here they are tearing down statues of Buddha and things
[22:00.560 --> 22:07.920]  just like the Muslims do and beating people to death you just type in malice youth brigades
[22:07.920 --> 22:15.120]  but let's go ahead and go to worldwide population being tortured in deep state Syop this is
[22:15.120 --> 22:21.400]  an incredibly important report you know what I'll do it next segment because I ran out
[22:21.400 --> 22:27.440]  of time reports a little longer than I thought oh look here's book burning right here and
[22:27.440 --> 22:34.360]  you've got all the young people some as young as your 7 years old and the average age 12
[22:34.360 --> 22:42.760]  and they're burning all those evil books and that's the official model of all this oh and
[22:42.760 --> 22:53.040]  guess what guess what the main mechanism of these brigades was to feed themselves when
[22:53.040 --> 22:59.280]  they would go out the countryside and round up people that weren't following all the orders
[22:59.280 --> 23:09.480]  they did as an act of will this is on record they would cook in huge pauldrons 10 feet
[23:09.480 --> 23:13.480]  high there's photos of these with people being put in them and they would chop up men women
[23:13.480 --> 23:20.560]  and children and throw them in and boil them and then sit there and eat their flesh look
[23:20.560 --> 23:32.760]  it up communist china and the practice of cooking political dissidents and eating them
[23:32.760 --> 23:38.560]  so this is the operating system that is being promoted by that devil george soros and that
[23:38.560 --> 23:43.000]  demon hillary and all these people and they really think they're going to be able to get
[23:43.000 --> 23:48.000]  away with this in america because my god capricorn it came out and said get rid of the american
[23:48.000 --> 23:53.080]  flag get rid of the country america is bad get rid of july 4th and major groups said
[23:53.080 --> 24:00.800]  we agree with you you're god sir you're god and now they're not going to put the national
[24:00.800 --> 24:04.440]  anthem they said at the beginning of the nfl now they're going to put the quote black national
[24:04.440 --> 24:11.360]  anthem that's a communist anthem to see oh first it's just take a knee for police brutality
[24:11.360 --> 24:18.400]  win the flag it didn't don't take a knee at a part of the game separately from i guess
[24:18.400 --> 24:23.440]  police brutality no no it's taking during the flag during the pledge of allegiance during
[24:23.440 --> 24:30.560]  the national anthem and now it's yeah i want to get rid of america america sucks and all
[24:30.560 --> 24:35.920]  he's doing is operating with some hundred billion dollar corporation that sells overpriced
[24:35.920 --> 24:48.720]  crappy shoes made in slave camps and it's all just this sick cover for this massive ai takeover
[24:48.720 --> 24:55.040]  of the culture and the force feeding of the propaganda and all of it and all the men in
[24:55.040 --> 25:02.160]  this country predominantly have been taught just keep your head down get into the fear
[25:02.160 --> 25:07.320]  of whatever bs they're pushing at the time and play along and you're going to get advanced
[25:07.320 --> 25:12.720]  in life no that's not what happens in this phase that's not what happens things get
[25:12.720 --> 25:20.360]  dystopic very very quickly because the globalist are now launching their operation so this
[25:20.360 --> 25:24.920]  is one of the most important reports ever and i'm glad people actually go to the research
[25:24.920 --> 25:30.920]  and codified what we talk about here because when i when i tell you they're all malice
[25:30.920 --> 25:35.080]  youth brigades i tell you they're using chinese communist brainwashing techniques i mean this
[25:35.080 --> 25:41.160]  is officially been adopted by the major psychiatric associations the average reporter knows what
[25:41.160 --> 25:47.160]  they're doing they're all in on it folks this is a criminal takeover and people are fighting
[25:47.160 --> 25:55.640]  and positioning themselves to be party members in the new authoritarian system instead of
[25:55.640 --> 26:02.040]  going out and fighting this people are auditioning to see who can get on their belly the fastest
[26:02.040 --> 26:07.480]  i want to warn those that have been working for the system though i've never seen a case
[26:07.480 --> 26:12.120]  when one of these things really comes into power that they don't burn the people that
[26:12.120 --> 26:17.400]  brought him to power there's a lot of reasons that's done it's scientific tyranny and would
[26:17.400 --> 26:20.480]  take an hour to go over it all but i think you've got a lot of reasons and answers yourselves
[26:20.480 --> 26:25.200]  but you'll want to purge over folks that engage in atrocities so another group can say they're
[26:25.200 --> 26:32.680]  another faction and it's always the same and you also don't want people like this that
[26:32.680 --> 26:39.680]  are power seekers because they're just gonna try to overthrow your regime so it's it's
[26:39.680 --> 26:46.200]  it's very very sophisticated there's a science to it and we are walking right down the road
[26:46.200 --> 26:51.360]  now to the gates of hell and crawling into it dragging our children with us i mean this
[26:51.360 --> 26:58.200]  is 100 total red alert we need to get back to the land back to self sufficiency and back
[26:58.200 --> 27:02.240]  to being prepared and the way to start ladies and gentlemen is having friends and family

[27:16.520 --> 27:21.560]  best price you're gonna find but you need to get the orders in now in the low before
[27:21.560 --> 27:25.760]  the storm i told you lockdown 2 was coming the new world order is making its move whether
[27:25.760 --> 27:31.520]  trump loses or wins things are just gonna get more crazy and this food lasts 25 years

[30:44.200 --> 30:49.800]  Watson quarterbacks the 4th hour Pastor Rodney Howard Brown who's been one of the biggest
[30:49.800 --> 30:55.680]  preachers day one got arrested saying he wasn't going to shut down his churches he's really
[30:55.680 --> 31:01.120]  written a powerful new book the tailing that covered 19 is a hoax in its response and its
[31:01.120 --> 31:06.920]  overblownness and it got banned off Amazon for thought crime and guess who else will
[31:06.920 --> 31:11.200]  join us at the bottom of the next hour Roger Stone with exclusive information when he's
[31:11.200 --> 31:17.000]  just days away from being sent to federal prison for a crime he didn't commit and for
[31:17.000 --> 31:22.680]  the crime of being an American patriot getting president Trump elected okay let me just go
[31:22.680 --> 31:29.200]  back to this I want to explain something it's on record that the Democratic Party has taken
[31:29.200 --> 31:33.560]  50 plus million dollars from Black Lives Matter it's on record that group was set up and funded
[31:33.560 --> 31:41.440]  by Soros as a Psyop to claim that a pack they control represents Black people it's real simple
[31:41.440 --> 31:47.840]  the Democrats made this group they got three Black Communist brainwashed women who don't
[31:47.840 --> 31:51.880]  know their ass from the home of the ground who are the front people and all the money
[31:51.880 --> 31:59.800]  sucked out and you know and they live in million dollar mansions and then they say we represent
[31:59.800 --> 32:08.200]  Black people and then they are indistinguishable in their command chain from Antifa that's
[32:08.200 --> 32:14.760]  run by refused fascism also funded by Soros and they work in tandem and that's in the
[32:14.760 --> 32:21.280]  Soros documents we got three years ago headline documents to tell plan in Maryland for martial
[32:21.280 --> 32:29.360]  law under Obama plan we have the documents it's how they run it how they try to go out
[32:29.360 --> 32:33.800]  and get Black people to burn stuff down and how the Whites are there leading it in their
[32:33.800 --> 32:42.520]  disguises so this is not a joke this is deadly serious and the new orders not spending tens
[32:42.520 --> 32:50.440]  of billions of dollars all this for nothing that's rather this video BLM founder says
[32:50.440 --> 32:55.920]  we are trained Marxists and we are carrying out a Maoist revolution you go out to these
[32:55.920 --> 33:03.400]  events you'll find them wearing Maoist youth brigade uniforms and when I drive by my armored
[33:03.400 --> 33:08.040]  vehicle when this is all coming they literally look at me and they're mainly usually white
[33:08.040 --> 33:13.520]  men and they go you're dead we're gonna kill you we take over they just point this you're
[33:13.520 --> 33:19.960]  dead you're dead you're dead these are killers but not really gonna do the killing by themselves
[33:19.960 --> 33:23.280]  but there's a big mob and they're burning down your house or whatever yeah they're gonna
[33:23.280 --> 33:29.040]  do that well guess what you're never gonna get me in one of your little FEMA camps and
[33:29.040 --> 33:34.680]  I just want them to know that if this kicks off the way you really want it to you're gonna
[33:34.680 --> 33:39.680]  beg for your mother you're gonna beg for your mommy and she ain't gonna be coming okay let's
[33:39.680 --> 33:46.840]  just move on from that but they are running this operation against us and it's deadly
[33:46.840 --> 33:51.240]  serious and now people know well Jones isn't exaggerating about this no I'm not exaggerating
[33:51.240 --> 33:57.480]  about any of it it's worse than I can tell you these people are on a power trip because
[33:57.480 --> 34:02.040]  they aren't commanded by globalist they have a plan they believe they're gonna have positions
[34:02.040 --> 34:10.760]  of power I'll never forget running to Antifa 20 years ago and Steve Mason a local activist
[34:10.760 --> 34:16.880]  who'd been a big liberal parents were Quakers on the East Coast he warned me he said this
[34:16.880 --> 34:20.800]  is the main group in the future this is what the communists really are within 20 years
[34:20.800 --> 34:24.480]  they plan to overthrow everything this is the group because he'd infiltrated them he'd
[34:24.480 --> 34:29.880]  been there he he he went deep we gotta talk to him in years gotta get him on the show
[34:29.880 --> 34:46.920]  I'll be alive and smarter than hell but I just can't believe I mean these people literally
[34:46.920 --> 34:51.240]  want to beat your brains out and take your kids away and you're lucky if they don't eat
[34:51.240 --> 34:57.280]  them okay by the way you guys didn't pull it up did you have trouble pulling up where
[34:57.280 --> 35:02.360]  the communist Chinese eat people Greg Reese found it the other day it was even like in
[35:02.360 --> 35:06.800]  Vanity Fair of all places I've written the exact name it was called flesh banquets communist
[35:06.800 --> 35:12.000]  Chinese flesh banquets I mean I want listeners to know we're not up here making any of this
[35:12.000 --> 35:16.800]  up okay here's the report it's on banned off video needs to get out to everybody it's so
[35:16.800 --> 35:24.280]  incredibly important worldwide population being tortured in deep state style periodist
[35:24.280 --> 35:31.440]  this report is based on amazing Polly's recent video is this torture in her video Polly
[35:31.440 --> 35:39.160]  examines amnesty internationals 1973 report on torture and how it seems to reflect the
[35:39.160 --> 35:47.800]  current response to COVID-19 according to amnesty internationals report torture is the systematic
[35:47.800 --> 35:54.120]  and deliberate infliction of acute pain in any form by one person on another in order
[35:54.120 --> 36:01.320]  to accomplish the purpose of the former against the will of the latter the report then uses
[36:01.320 --> 36:08.760]  Biederman's chart of coercion to describe the technique psychologist Albert Biederman
[36:08.760 --> 36:17.320]  studied communist Chinese tactics known as DDD debility dependency and dread the CIA
[36:17.320 --> 36:24.680]  has been trained to use debility dependency and dread and according to their 1983 human
[36:24.680 --> 36:31.120]  resource exploitation training manual many psychologists consider the threat of inducing
[36:31.120 --> 36:39.200]  debility to be more effective than debility itself with DDD the debilitated victim becomes
[36:39.200 --> 36:47.360]  dependent upon the torturer and develops a strong fear of anything vague or unknown
[36:47.360 --> 36:57.920]  Biederman's chart of coercion lays out the design of DDD does any of this sound familiar
[36:57.920 --> 37:04.480]  number one isolation we see this with quarantines and social distancing and the prohibition
[37:04.480 --> 37:11.760]  of crowds and large gatherings number two monopolization of perception corporate mainstream
[37:11.760 --> 37:17.720]  media has monopolized all of pop culture and those on social media who challenge the mainstream
[37:17.720 --> 37:26.080]  narrative are censored also listed is restricted movement and monotonous food number three
[37:26.080 --> 37:34.720]  induced debilitation and exhaustion gym closures church closures losing your job school closings
[37:34.720 --> 37:42.760]  and wearing masks all day long increased stress and provokes exhaustion and debilitation number
[37:42.760 --> 37:49.960]  four threats we are threatened that our own children may be taken away from our homes
[37:49.960 --> 37:56.800]  and that experimental force vaccines are coming we are told that more will die if we restart
[37:56.800 --> 38:05.120]  America and we are threatened with tracking chips contact tracing and a new normal number
[38:05.120 --> 38:15.000]  five occasional indulgences here we find fluctuations of interrogators attitudes such as BLM protests
[38:15.000 --> 38:23.160]  are good Trump rallies are bad Walmart is okay but small businesses are not the torturer
[38:23.160 --> 38:30.200]  will provide occasional indulgences such as rewards for partial compliance if you just
[38:30.200 --> 38:39.520]  wear a mask someday we can return to normal number six demonstrating omnipotence and omniscience
[38:39.520 --> 38:45.760]  shutting down the entire global economy was a pretty good demonstration of omnipotence
[38:45.760 --> 38:53.120]  huge fines and jail for people not wearing a mask we see the omniscience with Anthony
[38:53.120 --> 39:00.840]  Fauci Bill Gates and other official experts number seven is degradation being called
[39:00.840 --> 39:09.280]  nonessential or a science denier being treated as ignorant fools and called names by celebrities
[39:09.280 --> 39:17.480]  for not complying number eight enforcing trivial demands this final step develops habits of
[39:17.480 --> 39:26.080]  compliance enforcement of minute rules such as standing six feet apart following arrows
[39:26.080 --> 39:34.760]  and showing support for violent BLM protests also according to the report on torture many
[39:34.760 --> 39:40.920]  victims become ill as a result of coercion and more than half the illnesses listed in
[39:40.920 --> 39:47.680]  the report can be easily diagnosed as COVID-19 according to CDC I think you can tell there's
[39:47.680 --> 39:51.200]  a little bit more of the report it's a band on video this is key to the fight get it out

[41:18.960 --> 41:24.240]  added into the database as having a case that is counted as a case of COVID-19 it's in the
[41:24.240 --> 41:29.120]  NIH documents it's at the state level we confirmed it in Texas we're not confirming it's in other
[41:29.120 --> 41:34.400]  states this is beyond the other smoking guns of them putting people that died gunshot wounds

[44:47.200 --> 44:51.400]  shows a lot of people are awake unless it's a leftist but people say oh how does it feel
[44:51.400 --> 44:55.040]  to be vindicated how does it feel that it's all been proven I'm like I didn't feel good
[44:55.040 --> 45:01.360]  at all man it's like your mom gets a big lump in her breast and you like hey mom check
[45:01.360 --> 45:04.760]  that out I might be cancer and she goes yeah it's cancer it's like oh I'm vindicated you
[45:04.760 --> 45:14.240]  know it sucks and I'm just sitting here thinking about what I'm gonna put up with because you
[45:14.240 --> 45:26.920]  can always overthink the stuff stuff and I just want to see these globalist get off
[45:26.920 --> 45:36.120]  our backs I don't have vengeance I just want to be in a different universe than them you
[45:36.120 --> 45:40.000]  know what I mean because because they're bad people all right I'm not gonna start pontificating
[45:40.000 --> 45:46.720]  I mean by the time I watch 50 clips Fargo on air and read and looked all these news it
[45:46.720 --> 45:50.160]  just it just drives me crazy but we've got to do it that's why we're here doing it look
[45:50.160 --> 45:56.760]  at these headlines right here before these videos BLM teacher says two plus two only
[45:56.760 --> 46:04.200]  four because of Western imperialism and that math is racist by the way I was talking to
[46:04.200 --> 46:08.320]  a lady this morning and she's like yeah I used to be kind of a liberal but it's a cult
[46:08.320 --> 46:11.920]  now and she goes I used to work in PR you know she had a degree in it she goes this
[46:11.920 --> 46:17.400]  is real brainwashing she that's why I got out of it and I said yeah did you hear YouTube's
[46:17.400 --> 46:24.880]  now putting strikes on YouTube channels where they say white knight takes black pawn she
[46:24.880 --> 46:28.840]  didn't believe me till I showed her you know that that that doesn't make sense of course
[46:28.840 --> 46:33.040]  it doesn't make sense it's not supposed to make sense it's supposed to be if they tell
[46:33.040 --> 46:43.120]  you stay on your head and drink piss out of the toilet you do it it's cult brainwashing
[46:43.120 --> 46:51.640]  it's supposed to be nonsensical they're getting you ready to bow down and yes they're also
[46:51.640 --> 46:55.160]  officially saying chess itself is racist and you shouldn't be able to have white pieces
[46:55.160 --> 46:59.480]  and black pieces as if it has anything to do with race it's two different colors obviously
[46:59.480 --> 47:10.000]  opposing sides holy mackerel I've got a chess set I bought down in Mexico when I was a kid
[47:10.000 --> 47:13.880]  that the little Mayans make and it's you know green pieces and black pieces is that one
[47:13.880 --> 47:19.400]  side for the Martians but again it's all nonsensical I'm sorry that's one article here I have hundreds
[47:19.400 --> 47:26.680]  of these here's the next one California faculty demands free studies for all black students
[47:26.680 --> 47:30.840]  colleges that education is grounded in white supremacy that's how they bring in the new
[47:30.840 --> 47:35.600]  class system you see but it's not to empower black people they'll be the kept group the
[47:35.600 --> 47:41.400]  global control they claim that they're representing they're really just milking them university
[47:41.400 --> 47:45.960]  researcher forced out for highlighting facts showing no racial bias in police shootings
[47:45.960 --> 47:54.960]  in fact if you're a white person you are statistically the highest group to be shot by the police
[47:54.960 --> 47:58.520]  cops because there's just more white people being per capita because cops will actually
[47:58.520 --> 48:04.240]  do their job when they're doing white people because they know they're not gonna get sued
[48:04.240 --> 48:09.520]  like in Phoenix to the day people call on a guy with a gun out in the car and he's doing
[48:09.520 --> 48:14.920]  weird stuff the police get there and the guy has a gun in his hand pointing at him so that
[48:14.920 --> 48:19.600]  they'll shoot him you think the cops want to shoot somebody have a big freak no they're
[48:19.600 --> 48:24.200]  like put it down buddy put it down I can't believe the cops didn't shoot him quicker you
[48:24.200 --> 48:29.080]  point a gun at me I'll pull I mean this is insane man but this is designed to break society
[48:29.080 --> 48:34.560]  down here we go university researcher forced out for highlighting facts showing no racial
[48:34.560 --> 48:40.200]  bias in police shootings well actually there is if you're white the cops will shoot you
[48:40.200 --> 48:45.200]  quicker and there are some bad cops out there and you wait as the standards go down as good
[48:45.200 --> 48:50.720]  people don't want to be cops but I love how the group that called the cops on the guy
[48:50.720 --> 49:00.440]  with the gun then bitch about it like you call them they get there and then oh researchers
[49:00.440 --> 49:06.760]  say 26 million black lives matter protesters did not increase spread of COVID-19 and Santa
[49:06.760 --> 49:13.280]  Claus the Easter Bunny are real too so notice oh 26 million people's good but if you want
[49:13.280 --> 49:18.320]  to have a Baptist church service in New York the Blasio will have you arrested and he says
[49:18.320 --> 49:26.480]  black lives matter is more important in a video clip I will play in a moment but first
[49:26.480 --> 49:32.560]  then they send black lives matter into Baptist churches multiracial churches and scream names
[49:32.560 --> 49:40.040]  of black people you know that doesn't make sense no this isn't some PR thing where they're
[49:40.040 --> 49:45.880]  trying to look bad they want to be so godlike that they can march into your church and start
[49:45.880 --> 49:52.480]  fights with people and have it defended because they're whipping it up to the malice level
[49:52.480 --> 49:59.040]  violence look at this getting in front of somebody trying to go to the Baptist church
[49:59.040 --> 50:04.440]  we're allowed to march you can't have your church we're going to call black people uncle
[50:04.440 --> 50:15.840]  toms this is they're trying to get a fight you talk about getting on somebody's turf
[50:15.840 --> 50:21.800]  and it goes on and on shock video BLM harasses Christians attending church let's play this
[50:21.800 --> 50:26.320]  there's probably a 50 of these videos today black thug sucker punches dancing 12 year old
[50:26.320 --> 50:33.760]  white boy who was at a local dance school dancing out front let's go ahead and roll
[50:33.760 --> 50:41.080]  the video of that and again some trendy white kid probably autistic out with a multiracial
[50:41.080 --> 50:48.160]  group of black kids playing music having a good time and boom there's your diversity
[50:48.160 --> 50:55.920]  baby and then the black dudes like why'd you do that well because the other guy thinks
[50:55.920 --> 51:01.440]  it's cool because white people are bad didn't you hear white lives don't matter kid got
[51:01.440 --> 51:08.120]  a broken nose and a concussion but there you go that's a racial attack but oh it's you
[51:08.120 --> 51:14.560]  won't see that on the news oh poor white people like CNN says and it goes on from there let's
[51:14.560 --> 51:21.880]  go ahead and play a clip from a gentleman that you know ought to be on Fox News not
[51:21.880 --> 51:29.440]  on sports TV on the NBA Marcellus Wiley laying out with black lives matter really is here
[51:29.440 --> 51:38.360]  it is I'm gonna start with you yeah is this a good idea it's not a good idea I do want
[51:38.360 --> 51:43.600]  to give the players credit for their flex to even get this to be more than just an idea
[51:43.600 --> 51:50.000]  but something that's going to be in reality I give the players that but there's a problem
[51:50.000 --> 51:55.440]  with when you start to go down this road of the freedom of expression freedom of speech
[51:55.440 --> 52:01.960]  and how much social space is allowed for those who don't support in that same space and that's
[52:01.960 --> 52:07.760]  where I wonder where this is going to go in terms of identity politics we know what identity
[52:07.760 --> 52:13.680]  politics does it divides and it polarizes no matter how you want to look at it that's
[52:13.680 --> 52:19.280]  just the effect of it no matter how great the intentions are and we all know the road
[52:19.280 --> 52:24.440]  to hell is paved with good intentions so it's an interesting play right here I don't know
[52:24.440 --> 52:29.560]  how many people really look into the mission statement of black lives matter but I did
[52:29.560 --> 52:34.240]  and when you look into it there's a couple things that jump out to me and I'm a black
[52:34.240 --> 52:39.800]  man who's been black and my life has mattered since 1974 and this organization was found
[52:39.800 --> 52:46.880]  in 2013 I'm proud of you but I've been fighting this fight for me and for others a lot longer
[52:46.880 --> 52:52.520]  two things my family structure is so vital important to me not only the one I grew up
[52:52.520 --> 52:56.920]  in but the one I'm trying to create right now being a father and a husband that's my
[52:56.920 --> 53:02.880]  mission in life right now how do I reconcile that what I just told you with this mission
[53:02.880 --> 53:09.600]  statement that says quote we dismantle the patriarchal practice we disrupt the western
[53:09.600 --> 53:14.360]  prescribed nuclear family structure requirement when I know statistics when I know my reality
[53:14.360 --> 53:19.080]  forget statistics I knew this before I even went to Columbia and saw these same statistics
[53:19.080 --> 53:24.160]  that I'm going to read to you right now that children from single parent homes versus two
[53:24.160 --> 53:28.920]  parent homes the children from the single parent homes this is in 1995 I was reading
[53:28.920 --> 53:33.200]  this five times more likely to commit suicide six times more likely to be in poverty nine
[53:33.200 --> 53:37.160]  times more likely to drop out of high school 10 times more likely to abuse chemical substances
[53:37.160 --> 53:42.040]  14 times more likely to commit rape 20 times more likely to end up in prison and 32 times
[53:42.040 --> 53:46.720]  more likely to run away from home I knew that you know why I knew it because a lot of my
[53:46.720 --> 53:52.480]  friends didn't have family structures that were nuclear like mine and they found themselves
[53:52.480 --> 53:59.880]  outside of their dreams and goals and aspirations so when I see that or as a mission statement
[53:59.880 --> 54:05.000]  for black lives matter it makes me scratch my head when I also see their mission is to
[54:05.000 --> 54:13.520]  eradicate white supremacy in 2020 white supremacy is the mission that's a lot of digging through
[54:13.520 --> 54:18.440]  minutiae right there I am on a show that I'm hosting along with another black guy who is
[54:18.440 --> 54:23.320]  hosting with me who replaced another black guy and that's just one example of it so I
[54:23.320 --> 54:28.480]  understand I respect your space I respect what you're protesting for but will you respect
[54:28.480 --> 54:34.120]  others who don't support that same protest that's right and we're talking about globalist

[55:52.240 --> 55:59.200]  would die we did not do exactly as they said and it turned out it was all frauds the models
[55:59.200 --> 56:04.200]  the testing taking regular deaths and putting it in the covid 19 column all the complete
[56:04.200 --> 56:08.440]  criminal fraud but none of them are getting sued none of them are getting prosecuted
[56:08.440 --> 56:12.960]  none of them are getting in trouble except for bill gates the fda shut down his factories
[56:12.960 --> 56:18.160]  that are making fake covid tests that show everyone is positive and despite that they're
[56:18.160 --> 56:22.880]  still testing record numbers of people creating hysteria and sanglin numbers spiking and why
[56:22.880 --> 56:29.280]  it will be 200,000 dead by the election and it's all trumps fault and now oh china had

[56:47.240 --> 57:15.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[57:15.240 --> 57:25.800]  hi i can get all scientific or i can just get down to brass tags but we sit and we
[57:25.800 --> 57:31.200]  look at this we know this doesn't make sense going and attacking people at their houses
[57:31.200 --> 57:37.560]  attacking them at their churches going to multiracial churches and bowing up to people
[57:37.560 --> 57:43.400]  and getting their faces these thugs that we just showed you are paid and told what to
[57:43.400 --> 57:49.400]  go do they're given printout battle plans they're given bonuses i mean thousands of
[57:49.400 --> 57:55.720]  dollars if they can get somebody to attack you talk about putting black people down and
[57:55.720 --> 58:00.080]  treating them like animals we probably i think we have footage of this when we were having
[58:00.080 --> 58:06.760]  the anti-abortion rally a few years ago with the signs point out the kkk helped found plant
[58:06.760 --> 58:12.240]  parenthood and quotes a market singer little anti-mascumbag driving a brand new seventy
[58:12.240 --> 58:17.800]  thousand dollar jaguar he's a communist was driving around with money out the window offering
[58:17.800 --> 58:26.400]  them four hundred bucks for somebody to attack because they don't do the attack they go hand
[58:26.400 --> 58:32.280]  hammers out a deadly weapon somebody will get fifty years in jail and they try to get
[58:32.280 --> 58:42.720]  them not being ahead with the hammer but when i was there i watched him go over to an old
[58:42.720 --> 58:47.960]  man in crutches and start messing with him that's who the little white trendy that comes
[58:47.960 --> 58:52.520]  from some rich family these are all rich people and i'm not against this is not class warfare
[58:52.520 --> 58:56.720]  but they claim they're against money no they want it all they want to run the whole show
[58:56.720 --> 59:02.520]  they're all little dirty soy boys that think they can get out there and get them a big black
[59:02.520 --> 59:15.280]  book they call them to go out to the fighting forum it's disgusting and it pisses me off
[59:15.280 --> 59:27.800]  and we watch the entire system the money the chai comms the globalist the banks the power
[59:27.800 --> 59:34.400]  structure pour money into this and every american should reject it on its face and go this is
[59:34.400 --> 59:42.480]  ridiculous mega banks companies that own slave camps apples gonna lecture us how america
[59:42.480 --> 59:48.760]  sucks when they're involved in slavery at scales never before seen it's an abhorrent
[59:48.760 --> 1:00:01.440]  ridiculous fraud and then the adl got five to ten million dollars in taxpayer money even
[1:00:01.440 --> 1:00:07.080]  though they've got hundreds of millions of dollars and ninety two million in assets and
[1:00:07.080 --> 1:00:12.040]  now they've declared victory facebook has capitulated and says they will take orders
[1:00:12.040 --> 1:00:18.760]  from mr. rosenblatt who by the way runs everything else the southern probably lost her in the

[1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:13.600]  because they didn't have food but because their four plants were backed up packaging and getting
[1:02:13.600 --> 1:02:19.760]  it out now they are at three to four weeks right now they've gotten over the hump their
[1:02:19.760 --> 1:02:24.800]  other competitors are completely sold out or selling old garbage this is high quality
[1:02:24.800 --> 1:02:30.120]  food i would advise everyone to do what i'm doing and buy more storeable food now before

[1:04:04.200 --> 1:04:08.040]  them who to ban who to censor they say what symbols are good what symbols are bad and

[1:07:28.600 --> 1:07:40.640]  loves you because he's going to nuesome sorry uh let's just get right back to where we were
[1:07:40.640 --> 1:07:45.040]  here is the most orwellian communist statement preplanned ever that you know he worked on
[1:07:45.040 --> 1:07:48.760]  with lawyers and scyop operators because this is the speech he gives every day where he
[1:07:48.760 --> 1:07:57.560]  goes on tv this weekend and he says apples and oranges i met with religious leaders
[1:07:57.560 --> 1:08:02.280]  so if he meets with a few quote stakeholders that's how the un works oh then the thousands
[1:08:02.280 --> 1:08:05.600]  of other churches that don't agree with being shut down they're shut down because he talked
[1:08:05.600 --> 1:08:09.040]  to a cardinal and they said it was okay so he just shut down the baptist churches because
[1:08:09.040 --> 1:08:15.400]  the cardinal said it was okay or vice versa and then oh the black lives matter this is
[1:08:15.400 --> 1:08:23.520]  a historical cultural this is a good thing 26 million marchings a good thing but then
[1:08:23.520 --> 1:08:28.600]  they send the black lives matter which is antifa directly to the baptist churches for
[1:08:28.600 --> 1:08:34.640]  no reason just that it's known they're more conservative to politically scream and yell
[1:08:34.640 --> 1:08:39.520]  and try to start fights so here's the blaseo first then we'll show you some of the uh of
[1:08:39.520 --> 1:08:43.760]  what happened just this sunday here it is i asked you about a court decision from last
[1:08:43.760 --> 1:08:49.320]  week a federal court rule that you and governor komo violated the constitution by restricting
[1:08:49.320 --> 1:08:55.160]  religious services during the lockdown of the pandemic the court said you openly discouraged
[1:08:55.160 --> 1:09:00.920]  religious gatherings and threatened religious worshipers and sent a clear message that mass
[1:09:00.920 --> 1:09:07.280]  protests are deserving of preferential treatment essentially saying that you treated the protesters
[1:09:07.280 --> 1:09:12.080]  who were on the streets differently than the religious gatherings that were on the streets
[1:09:12.080 --> 1:09:18.760]  your reaction just wrong we worked with the religious leadership of this city for months
[1:09:18.760 --> 1:09:23.240]  cardinal dolan in the catholic church and so many other religious leaders who are in
[1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:28.280]  full agreement that it was not time to bring back religious services because of the danger
[1:09:28.280 --> 1:09:33.960]  it would cause to their congregants the protests were an entirely different reality a national
[1:09:33.960 --> 1:09:38.320]  phenomenon that was not something that the government could just say you know go away
[1:09:38.320 --> 1:09:43.520]  it's something that really came from the grass roots and obviously had profound meaning
[1:09:43.520 --> 1:09:51.200]  back it up for a minute you see he's saying you're not essential and we the government
[1:09:51.200 --> 1:09:55.840]  decide when churches can operate which violates the first clause of the first amendment congress
[1:09:55.840 --> 1:09:59.880]  will make no law responsibility to establish religion or be the first says thereof sat
[1:09:59.880 --> 1:10:06.800]  trying to go too fast congress shall make no law congress shall make no law restricting
[1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:10.160]  the establishment of religion or prohibit the first exercise thereof you don't have
[1:10:10.160 --> 1:10:16.920]  jurisdiction but he's saying we decide what is valuable we decide what is essential we
[1:10:16.920 --> 1:10:23.360]  decide what is acceptable here it is for months cardinal dolan in the catholic church and
[1:10:23.360 --> 1:10:28.520]  so many other religious leaders who are in full agreement that it was not time to bring
[1:10:28.520 --> 1:10:34.040]  back religious services because of the danger it would cause to their congregants the protests
[1:10:34.040 --> 1:10:39.240]  were an entirely different reality a national phenomenon that was not something that the
[1:10:39.240 --> 1:10:43.320]  government could just say you know go away it's something that really came from the grass
[1:10:43.320 --> 1:10:48.760]  roots and obviously had profound meaning and we're all acting on the meaning of those protests
[1:10:48.760 --> 1:10:53.720]  but it's really apples and oranges our religious leaders were the first to say it was not time
[1:10:53.720 --> 1:10:59.920]  to bring back services now we're doing it carefully smartly so I think that decision
[1:10:59.920 --> 1:11:04.680]  profoundly misses what the very religious institutions themselves were saying let's
[1:11:04.680 --> 1:11:11.760]  talk about where we are in absolutely disgusting absolutely evil as satanic as it gets what
[1:11:11.760 --> 1:11:17.520]  a monster saying we run your churches but our globalist democrat party fundraising machine
[1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:20.840]  that's already stolen fifty million dollars from people we're going to do what we want
[1:11:20.840 --> 1:11:26.440]  because we're profound we're important you're not he's demoralizing you but he knows you're
[1:11:26.440 --> 1:11:30.840]  going to submit to him he knows already got your main religious leaders they think they
[1:11:30.840 --> 1:11:36.440]  got you folks they don't have you compliance with these monsters is death we're gonna go
[1:11:36.440 --> 1:11:41.320]  to break I'm gonna come back with the attacks on the churches they're now taking place and

[1:15:15.560 --> 1:15:21.480]  balsamaro test positive for COVID-19 because anybody that's ever had a cold the coronavirus
[1:15:21.480 --> 1:15:31.000]  test positive meanwhile santa anna is his new nickname abbot admits low death COVID rate in
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:38.040]  texas still wants to shut down texas economy anyways so he's trying to act like he's against
[1:15:38.040 --> 1:15:42.920]  california's total lockdown with the partial one that's here in place and again they admit that
[1:15:42.920 --> 1:15:49.720]  they're counting 15 cases for every COVID patient just with a computer model it's only one of eight
[1:15:49.720 --> 1:15:59.000]  states doing it last time I checked seven democrat states and texas why abbot you know I learned
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:09.720]  this weekend abbot when I went and bullhorned him on Friday again he was there we had our sources
[1:16:11.400 --> 1:16:15.720]  and he literally was asking the security people I wonder who put jones up to this
[1:16:16.600 --> 1:16:21.000]  because he isn't even talking to the lieutenant governor now who's against this they're fighting
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:29.400]  with each other and he thought that I came down there because I was told to by someone because I
[1:16:29.400 --> 1:16:34.840]  guess in abbots world he takes orders from we're not sure who now I thought it was the people of
[1:16:34.840 --> 1:16:42.440]  texas listen buddy boy when I do things it's because I'm doing them but I love how these politicians
[1:16:42.440 --> 1:16:47.800]  always think everybody's working for somebody else I'm not working for dan patrick but maybe
[1:16:47.800 --> 1:16:57.480]  he needs your job seriously I maybe abbots just a political animal he knows the public's dumb
[1:16:58.600 --> 1:17:02.600]  maybe he's right they just you know he's like hey that doesn't matter if it's all a hoax we
[1:17:02.600 --> 1:17:06.840]  got to go with it you know I kind of told trump up front that I said this is man made I think it's
[1:17:06.840 --> 1:17:16.120]  just they want to own it and track it but I said we got to wait and see but it just the china welding
[1:17:16.120 --> 1:17:20.680]  people in and all the dystopic stuff looked a lot looked fake and turn it some of it was fake
[1:17:23.080 --> 1:17:26.680]  they execute you in china if you do something unauthorized and it was all the media was just
[1:17:26.680 --> 1:17:29.480]  playing stuff out of a zombie apocalypse movie
[1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:38.360]  and so I was like hey trump watch out don't say it's not a threat wait and see but as soon as we
[1:17:38.360 --> 1:17:43.960]  saw it was a total hoax we're like whoa whoa whoa hold your horses but now we're already in the trap
[1:17:43.960 --> 1:17:46.920]  maybe I made a mistake
[1:17:50.600 --> 1:17:53.960]  I don't make a lot of big mistakes but you know maybe up front I should have said that it's all
[1:17:53.960 --> 1:17:59.320]  a hoax it's all a fraud but the fact that prestigious universities were saying it was man made and
[1:17:59.320 --> 1:18:05.560]  showing the scans and then they were being censored to protect china made me take the bait and say well
[1:18:05.560 --> 1:18:14.360]  so we know what it is it's a gain of function cold virus that spreads everywhere so they
[1:18:14.360 --> 1:18:21.880]  can test you positive and create hysteria and then if you die they will attribute whatever you
[1:18:21.880 --> 1:18:27.560]  died of gunshot wound great white shark attack it doesn't matter skydiving accident get hit by a
[1:18:27.560 --> 1:18:34.120]  mack truck literally and now we're here they admit it's fraudulent numbers they admit they're
[1:18:34.120 --> 1:18:39.320]  exaggerating they admit that the death toll was 20 something times lower what they said and we're
[1:18:39.320 --> 1:18:43.400]  just in the trap now and it's just like well we can't ever leave our houses again because of the
[1:18:43.400 --> 1:18:58.600]  common cold all right let me get back to what I was breaking down here can you believe the ADL
[1:18:58.600 --> 1:19:04.360]  Sasha burko and went up on tv late last year and said arrest anyone that disagrees with us
[1:19:05.080 --> 1:19:10.200]  and arrest anyone that we say arrest for their speech and we're gonna arrest mark zucker burger
[1:19:10.200 --> 1:19:17.640]  isn't going to ADL control i mean how scary and creepy and wild eyed is that but you know what
[1:19:18.200 --> 1:19:22.680]  facebook just said okay ADL runs us you'll tell us what to get rid of what to allow
[1:19:22.680 --> 1:19:28.920]  and again twitter youtube all of it adl run along with some private law center
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:35.240]  it's like the adl is the political muscle but some of our law center actually does the main
[1:19:35.240 --> 1:19:44.200]  training and i mean it's just the family's bad uh the master bedrooms are bad okay signs are bad
[1:19:44.200 --> 1:19:50.840]  and you're like that's ridiculous no the adl says listen americans you don't use any words or talk
[1:19:50.840 --> 1:19:56.040]  unless it's approved by us do you got that straight well that sounds like the soviet union wrapped
[1:19:56.040 --> 1:20:06.760]  up in hitler to me sounds like something i don't want to go along with it's creepy it's scary it's
[1:20:06.760 --> 1:20:16.120]  bad it's dangerous it's unamerican oh but all the big real nazi sites are up there because the adl
[1:20:16.120 --> 1:20:21.800]  needs to have that up there to say look there's the nazis so that when they point it alice jones
[1:20:21.800 --> 1:20:31.720]  there's stefa malinu and get us banned they have the political cover they need meanwhile here's real
[1:20:31.720 --> 1:20:37.480]  fascism here's real authoritarianism here's real malice communism in new york at the baptist church

[1:26:54.520 --> 1:26:59.560]  i got glass of water and i just stopped in the hallway and i just thought about the videos we
[1:26:59.560 --> 1:27:06.440]  just watched and there's there's more than those it gets even worse of thugs shoving their way
[1:27:06.440 --> 1:27:13.160]  into a church and shoving a multiracial church of baptist around threatening to beat their ass and
[1:27:13.160 --> 1:27:17.720]  poking their fingers in two-year-old children's faces and saying i'm calling the cps on you
[1:27:17.720 --> 1:27:25.240]  we're going to take your kids these are communist youth brigades literally harassing black people
[1:27:25.240 --> 1:27:33.000]  telling them they can't go to this church i mean this is sick folks the fact that they can get
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:38.120]  people go well this is horrible why would deblazio send these people here he runs it
[1:27:38.120 --> 1:27:42.680]  because if they can get him to do that they'll do anything and the media is defending this
[1:27:42.680 --> 1:27:49.160]  people shoving body armor with clubs and knives and they shove their way in and they threaten to
[1:27:49.160 --> 1:27:56.280]  attack people i mean i'm sorry you're in my church inside the church you threaten to knock me out
[1:27:56.280 --> 1:27:59.720]  you just threaten me i'm gonna i'm gonna attack you but here's the thing these christians are
[1:27:59.720 --> 1:28:05.320]  better christians than i am because they understand that that's what these bad people want and they
[1:28:05.320 --> 1:28:09.960]  didn't give them what they wanted but it makes me physically mad at myself that we've got to this
[1:28:09.960 --> 1:28:14.760]  point i mean look at this thugs shoving people in a church
[1:28:19.160 --> 1:28:22.040]  all because that church pissed deblazio off and wouldn't shut down
[1:28:22.840 --> 1:28:27.000]  the black lives matter is there to say we get our speech you don't get nothing
[1:28:28.120 --> 1:28:32.040]  i'm not just it's over and churches got burned down all over the country
[1:28:32.760 --> 1:28:36.200]  my leftists who think they should be able to march but nobody else should be able to
[1:28:36.200 --> 1:28:40.440]  go to these churches where a lot of the old people go to these and it's all they've got
[1:28:41.160 --> 1:28:45.160]  is these communities and you're trying to take that away from them you evil globalistic pieces
[1:28:45.160 --> 1:28:49.880]  of trash so you hear about a shutdown churches in china well it's happening here now all right
[1:28:51.560 --> 1:28:55.960]  we got a big exclusive with roger stone i had to twist his arm to do this he's only days away
[1:28:55.960 --> 1:29:02.680]  from a potential death sentence if anything happens to him in prison it is on this tyrant
[1:29:02.680 --> 1:29:06.440]  judge's head we'll talk about that the emergency appeal he just filed
[1:29:10.680 --> 1:29:13.960]  lost his house you know doing the show out of the apartment nothing wrong with that but that's
[1:29:13.960 --> 1:29:17.960]  how serious and real this is folks you don't know the cost of this believe me i've been sued a
[1:29:17.960 --> 1:29:22.360]  bunch of attack i know what it costs it's it's devastating but we're in a fight it's okay he's
[1:29:22.360 --> 1:29:27.000]  a winner he's a fighter he's not a victim he's a target he understands that but he needs your help
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:32.520]  so do we we're in this together and then i asked him well like last week i said please come on

[1:29:43.400 --> 1:29:49.080]  the ap and others reported that she's got tapes of these world leaders she's got all the black
[1:29:49.080 --> 1:29:53.480]  no material well the fb i reported epstein has all these cds with it where are those we're taking
[1:29:53.480 --> 1:29:57.960]  out the new york facility so we've got him here for just the next 20 minutes or so roger thanks
[1:29:57.960 --> 1:30:05.320]  for coming on with us today uh you've got the floor alex thanks for having me on because you
[1:30:05.320 --> 1:30:11.240]  know the situation surrounding my case changes so quickly literally minute to minute uh and the
[1:30:11.240 --> 1:30:16.360]  the info warriors had been among my most loyal supporters including buddy that works right there
[1:30:16.360 --> 1:30:22.920]  in your facility uh not to mention you yourself so i always want my supporters who are praying for
[1:30:22.920 --> 1:30:29.240]  me who have helped finance my defense and helped my family to know the latest you're absolutely right
[1:30:29.240 --> 1:30:35.720]  i'm at seven days seven days away from being sent to a prison where the federal
[1:30:36.520 --> 1:30:43.160]  prisons has tried very hard to cover up by substantial and growing a corona virus crisis last
[1:30:43.160 --> 1:30:49.960]  week they had no cases now they say they have won blowers in the facility both inmates and prison
[1:30:49.960 --> 1:30:55.480]  guards who were tell us that there are additional cases that are being being being being being
[1:30:55.480 --> 1:31:01.960]  concealed uh but as you know i'm here years old and with a history of respiratory problems my
[1:31:01.960 --> 1:31:09.240]  entire life i would be at great risk i would be extraordinarily vulnerable uh we filed an emergency
[1:31:09.240 --> 1:31:14.920]  motion with judge jackson uh based on the government's policy based on my health uh based on the law
[1:31:14.920 --> 1:31:21.880]  and she denied it uh yesterday we had no choice but to file an emergency appeal with the dc circuit
[1:31:21.880 --> 1:31:28.840]  court of appeals uh making essentially the case that jackson was wrong across the board uh and
[1:31:28.840 --> 1:31:35.240]  that i had that i had that i had i had i had i had a real life in death situation i'm not i'm not
[1:31:35.240 --> 1:31:39.480]  confident roger stay right there we're having that max headroom thing you know that show from the
[1:31:39.480 --> 1:31:41.420]  in the early 80s where he would literally,
[1:31:41.420 --> 1:31:44.200]  la, la, la, la, from somehow your Skype does that.
[1:31:44.200 --> 1:31:46.680]  But we may connect with your cell phone here in a moment,
[1:31:46.680 --> 1:31:49.560]  but let me see if it clears up here for just a second
[1:31:49.560 --> 1:31:52.200]  or see if maybe some stuff can be shut down there
[1:31:52.200 --> 1:31:53.040]  on your computer.
[1:31:53.040 --> 1:31:55.120]  But I mean, this is really happening.
[1:31:55.120 --> 1:31:59.620]  They released all these rapists and murderers
[1:31:59.620 --> 1:32:03.920]  and criminals, some of which had just served a few months
[1:32:03.920 --> 1:32:05.560]  in the case of Harvey Weinstein,
[1:32:05.560 --> 1:32:07.440]  but you supposedly lied to Congress,
[1:32:07.440 --> 1:32:08.680]  which has been proven fraud.
[1:32:08.680 --> 1:32:09.920]  They had a show trial.
[1:32:09.920 --> 1:32:12.080]  They had a totally rigged deal, rigged jury.
[1:32:12.080 --> 1:32:13.120]  It's all come out.
[1:32:13.120 --> 1:32:14.760]  And now you've still got to go to prison.
[1:32:14.760 --> 1:32:15.680]  This is insane.
[1:32:19.200 --> 1:32:21.600]  I'm gonna take one cue about it.
[1:32:21.600 --> 1:32:23.600]  Yeah, we're gonna connect with them on cell phone.
[1:32:23.600 --> 1:32:25.360]  We're gonna go right back to Roger Stone here
[1:32:25.360 --> 1:32:26.440]  in just a moment.
[1:32:27.680 --> 1:32:31.560]  And then he's gonna give you the latest on Gisling Maxwell
[1:32:31.560 --> 1:32:34.200]  and what this really means and why the Clintons
[1:32:34.200 --> 1:32:39.200]  and others are so incredibly scared right now.
[1:32:39.440 --> 1:32:40.800]  But Roger Stone's defense fund,
[1:32:40.800 --> 1:32:42.760]  we can put that up on screen.
[1:32:42.760 --> 1:32:47.760]  They've really tried to bankrupt him, stonedefensefund.com.
[1:32:47.760 --> 1:32:49.240]  And I hope that you will all go there
[1:32:49.240 --> 1:32:50.640]  and I hope that you will support him
[1:32:50.640 --> 1:32:53.200]  because I'm in the same position.
[1:32:53.200 --> 1:32:55.240]  The Democrats followed over 50 lawsuits on us.
[1:32:55.240 --> 1:32:56.960]  We're down to eight.
[1:32:56.960 --> 1:32:58.560]  They've got Georgetown University,
[1:32:58.560 --> 1:33:02.360]  the Vatican's suing us over our speech.
[1:33:02.360 --> 1:33:05.440]  We have the Democratic Party funding groups suing us.
[1:33:05.440 --> 1:33:09.400]  I mean, it is a total and complete war.
[1:33:10.800 --> 1:33:13.120]  So we now have Roger Stone over the phone and Skype.
[1:33:13.120 --> 1:33:15.640]  Roger, please continue with the persecution,
[1:33:15.640 --> 1:33:17.760]  seven days out from jail, the emergency appeal
[1:33:17.760 --> 1:33:19.320]  you just filed.
[1:33:19.320 --> 1:33:20.800]  Well, first of all, you're absolutely right.
[1:33:20.800 --> 1:33:23.640]  I never realized how much I looked like Max Hedrell.
[1:33:23.640 --> 1:33:25.160]  But moving on from that,
[1:33:26.600 --> 1:33:30.320]  I'm seven days away from being sent to a prison
[1:33:30.320 --> 1:33:33.800]  where the Federal Bureau of Prisons is dissembling
[1:33:33.800 --> 1:33:37.400]  about how many actual cases of COVID-19
[1:33:37.400 --> 1:33:41.440]  they have among both prison workers and inmates.
[1:33:41.440 --> 1:33:44.520]  67 years old with a history of respiratory problems.
[1:33:44.520 --> 1:33:47.320]  This is, in essence, a death sentence.
[1:33:47.320 --> 1:33:49.400]  By the way, the folks at Media Matters
[1:33:49.400 --> 1:33:52.120]  who are mocking me, greetings guys.
[1:33:52.120 --> 1:33:53.560]  Now it really is a death sentence.
[1:33:53.560 --> 1:33:56.200]  Make sure you get that in your headline.
[1:33:56.200 --> 1:33:58.440]  The point, of course, is that now I've gone
[1:33:58.440 --> 1:34:01.200]  to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals
[1:34:01.200 --> 1:34:03.440]  to appeal the judge's ruling
[1:34:03.440 --> 1:34:07.120]  to essentially send me to my maker.
[1:34:07.120 --> 1:34:11.080]  And we've asked for an immediate emergency expedition
[1:34:11.080 --> 1:34:13.040]  of that, but I've been quite candid.
[1:34:13.040 --> 1:34:16.280]  I don't have high hopes that the DC Circuit
[1:34:16.280 --> 1:34:19.240]  is going to do anything other than remand the decision
[1:34:19.240 --> 1:34:21.080]  back to Judge Jackson.
[1:34:21.080 --> 1:34:23.360]  The important thing is at that point,
[1:34:23.360 --> 1:34:27.440]  I will have exhausted every possible legal remedy
[1:34:27.440 --> 1:34:28.920]  my lawyers can come up with,
[1:34:28.920 --> 1:34:31.480]  and there is only one man on the planet
[1:34:31.480 --> 1:34:36.480]  who I have been very clear that I am praying for,
[1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:39.960]  that he will, in an act of mercy and justice,
[1:34:39.960 --> 1:34:44.400]  grant an act of clemency so I can get justice in my case.
[1:34:44.400 --> 1:34:48.040]  All I want is a commutation of my sentence
[1:34:48.040 --> 1:34:51.000]  so that I can follow out my appeal and win.
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:53.360]  I will be exonerated on appeal,
[1:34:53.360 --> 1:34:54.920]  but I have to live long enough.
[1:34:54.920 --> 1:34:57.800]  And the appeal, as you know, is a year away
[1:34:57.800 --> 1:34:59.320]  and probably another million dollars.
[1:34:59.320 --> 1:35:02.680]  And let's be absolutely clear about this.
[1:35:02.680 --> 1:35:05.120]  This isn't just Roger Stone, we're all Roger Stone.
[1:35:05.120 --> 1:35:07.720]  If they can continue to politically persecute people
[1:35:07.720 --> 1:35:10.000]  and put people in prison, you're the beta test.
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:11.360]  As you know, we can't get into it.
[1:35:11.360 --> 1:35:13.000]  They want to put me in prison right now.
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:15.240]  They're trying to build a case against me as well.
[1:35:15.240 --> 1:35:16.760]  They're not planning to stop.
[1:35:16.760 --> 1:35:19.320]  They've already brought back the Russiagate BS again.
[1:35:20.640 --> 1:35:23.360]  Well, Alex, we're in the same boat for the same reason.
[1:35:23.360 --> 1:35:24.840]  We're truth tellers.
[1:35:24.840 --> 1:35:27.320]  We have dared to stick our thumb in the eye
[1:35:27.320 --> 1:35:30.360]  of the political establishment and tell the people the truth.
[1:35:30.360 --> 1:35:33.120]  And I've done so as you have without regard to parties.
[1:35:33.120 --> 1:35:35.760]  The Bushes are just as corrupt as the Clintons.
[1:35:35.760 --> 1:35:39.880]  They're equally corrupt and they're all in it together.
[1:35:39.880 --> 1:35:42.960]  And now the worst possible thing happened
[1:35:42.960 --> 1:35:45.560]  that they could imagine, Donald Trump,
[1:35:45.560 --> 1:35:50.080]  an uncontrollable nationalist, a man who loves America,
[1:35:50.080 --> 1:35:52.440]  a man who believes in American exceptionalism
[1:35:52.440 --> 1:35:57.440]  and America's destiny and America's sovereignty
[1:35:58.360 --> 1:36:00.120]  comes along and upsets their plan.
[1:36:00.120 --> 1:36:01.200]  They had it all worked out.
[1:36:01.200 --> 1:36:02.600]  It was going to be Hillary or Jeb.
[1:36:02.600 --> 1:36:03.440]  It didn't matter.
[1:36:03.440 --> 1:36:05.360]  The policies would be the same.
[1:36:05.360 --> 1:36:08.560]  Both families with pocket billions in the country.
[1:36:08.560 --> 1:36:10.240]  We'd sell the country out to the Chinese.
[1:36:10.240 --> 1:36:11.560]  That was the plan.
[1:36:11.560 --> 1:36:12.400]  But guess what?
[1:36:12.400 --> 1:36:13.240]  The best laid plans of-
[1:36:13.240 --> 1:36:14.360]  But he disrupted the plan.
[1:36:14.360 --> 1:36:16.640]  The best laid plans of mice and men off the go astray.
[1:36:16.640 --> 1:36:18.880]  By the way, your phone's the best HD audio I've ever heard.
[1:36:18.880 --> 1:36:21.920]  We'll be back with Roger to shift gears into
[1:36:21.920 --> 1:36:25.080]  the latest on Jeffrey Epstein and so much more.
[1:36:25.080 --> 1:36:27.520]  His advice to President Trump in 2020,
[1:36:27.520 --> 1:36:29.160]  Roger Stone, straight ahead.
[1:36:29.160 --> 1:36:30.000]  Stay with us.
[1:36:31.640 --> 1:36:34.640]  Just happened on Tuesday morning driving into work
[1:36:34.640 --> 1:36:36.440]  about to break the big Roger Stone news
[1:36:36.440 --> 1:36:38.920]  and the big COVID-19 hoax news.
[1:36:38.920 --> 1:36:42.760]  And I met a red light at the corner of Brody and 290
[1:36:42.760 --> 1:36:45.040]  and an old Mercedes pulls up next to me
[1:36:45.040 --> 1:36:48.760]  and a Hispanic man and two white women start flipping me off.
[1:36:48.760 --> 1:36:50.880]  And I thought they recognized who I was.
[1:36:50.880 --> 1:36:52.440]  So I rolled down my window and I said,
[1:36:52.440 --> 1:36:54.080]  what, COVID-19's a hoax?
[1:36:54.080 --> 1:36:57.120]  And they were going, F-U, F-U, F-U, F-U, F-U.
[1:36:57.120 --> 1:36:58.840]  F-U and I said, is that your IQ?
[1:36:58.840 --> 1:36:59.680]  One finger?
[1:36:59.680 --> 1:37:00.760]  So they got put up two fingers.
[1:37:00.760 --> 1:37:02.600]  I said, oh, it's 11.
[1:37:02.600 --> 1:37:03.880]  And I was like, do you know who I am?
[1:37:03.880 --> 1:37:04.880]  They're like shaking their heads.
[1:37:04.880 --> 1:37:06.560]  They go, where your mask?
[1:37:06.560 --> 1:37:07.720]  Where your mask?
[1:37:07.720 --> 1:37:08.880]  And they're pointing at the mask.
[1:37:08.880 --> 1:37:10.800]  So I guess Joy Behar, when she says she goes around
[1:37:10.800 --> 1:37:12.800]  and does this with her husband, this is a thing, man.
[1:37:12.800 --> 1:37:15.080]  Their cult is going crazy.
[1:37:15.080 --> 1:37:17.400]  Their control freaks, their attacking language,
[1:37:17.400 --> 1:37:19.720]  borders, everything, because they all bet
[1:37:19.720 --> 1:37:22.280]  on leftist garbage that hasn't delivered to them.
[1:37:22.280 --> 1:37:24.760]  So they're totally going completely insane.
[1:37:24.760 --> 1:37:26.040]  This is crazy.
[1:37:26.040 --> 1:37:31.240]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.

[1:38:27.920 --> 1:38:29.680]  your focus, and your support.
[1:38:29.680 --> 1:38:31.080]  Again, I salute you all.
[1:38:32.280 --> 1:38:35.280]  Customers are saying what I was privately saying
[1:38:35.280 --> 1:38:37.280]  to the crew last night.
[1:38:37.280 --> 1:38:39.640]  We may have just broken not just the biggest story
[1:38:39.640 --> 1:38:43.280]  in Infowars history, but one of the biggest stories, period.
[1:38:43.280 --> 1:38:48.280]  The state of Texas confirms that the CDC and NIH
[1:38:48.280 --> 1:38:52.440]  have created a system where anyone that has a sore throat
[1:38:52.440 --> 1:38:55.640]  or a runny nose or who has been in contact
[1:38:55.640 --> 1:38:59.520]  with someone COVID-19 is then added into the database
[1:38:59.520 --> 1:39:02.960]  as having a case that is counted as a case of COVID-19.
[1:39:02.960 --> 1:39:04.840]  It's in the NIH documents.
[1:39:04.840 --> 1:39:05.760]  It's at the state level.
[1:39:05.760 --> 1:39:06.800]  We confirmed it in Texas.
[1:39:06.800 --> 1:39:08.680]  We're now confirming it's in other states.
[1:39:08.680 --> 1:39:11.880]  This is beyond the other smoking guns of them
[1:39:11.880 --> 1:39:13.520]  including people with a die gun shot wounds
[1:39:13.520 --> 1:39:15.040]  and stuff in the COVID column
[1:39:15.040 --> 1:39:16.880]  and the false positive test.
[1:39:16.880 --> 1:39:17.720]  That's all huge.
[1:39:17.720 --> 1:39:22.480]  This is beyond that mega criminal activity.
[1:39:22.480 --> 1:39:24.800]  And we've got these Inver County Commission videos
[1:39:24.800 --> 1:39:26.440]  where they're just freaking out over it
[1:39:26.440 --> 1:39:28.280]  saying what in the world is this?
[1:39:28.280 --> 1:39:30.160]  The full video is posted at band.video.
[1:39:30.160 --> 1:39:31.960]  Get it out and expose the hoax.
[1:39:31.960 --> 1:39:42.440]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[1:39:42.440 --> 1:39:49.640]  computer radio
[1:39:49.640 --> 1:39:51.120]  In Ford store dot com.
[1:39:51.120 --> 1:39:56.080]  We can't survive without pure clean drinking water.

[1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:28.560]  InfowarsStore.com.
[1:40:28.560 --> 1:40:31.040]  Other systems just don't compare.
[1:40:36.200 --> 1:40:39.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:49.480]  Lots of those things were changing yesterday.
[1:40:49.480 --> 1:40:52.960]  Well, I've seen the hard times and the pressures
[1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:55.360]  that all need to be.
[1:40:55.360 --> 1:41:00.960]  Well, I keep on working like a working man.
[1:41:00.960 --> 1:41:03.120]  And I've got my act together.
[1:41:03.120 --> 1:41:05.360]  I'm going to warm all of you.
[1:41:05.360 --> 1:41:07.840]  Give me back my bullets.
[1:41:07.840 --> 1:41:10.320]  And Roger Stone is definitely a big old magazine
[1:41:10.320 --> 1:41:12.640]  of bullets in Trump's truth gun.
[1:41:12.640 --> 1:41:15.040]  And we need him to get pardoned or clemencies going
[1:41:15.040 --> 1:41:16.720]  to jail in seven days.
[1:41:16.720 --> 1:41:18.880]  Political prisoner, more on that in a moment.
[1:41:18.880 --> 1:41:21.720]  But first, Roger, I know you don't tell me you got news.
[1:41:21.720 --> 1:41:24.760]  Unless you got news, you live near Palm Beach.
[1:41:24.760 --> 1:41:28.680]  You know what's going on with Epstein, Gisling Maxwell.
[1:41:28.680 --> 1:41:30.760]  Her getting finally arrested.
[1:41:30.760 --> 1:41:33.560]  The Southern District of New York US Attorney
[1:41:33.560 --> 1:41:36.560]  being removed reportedly for blocking the investigation.
[1:41:36.560 --> 1:41:39.080]  All of this starting to come to the head.
[1:41:39.080 --> 1:41:42.440]  What is the inside scoop on the word
[1:41:42.440 --> 1:41:45.040]  that she has these get out of jail free cards,
[1:41:45.040 --> 1:41:47.600]  these secret tapes of world leaders raping children?
[1:41:47.600 --> 1:41:49.840]  We know the FBI says there's hundreds of DVDs
[1:41:49.840 --> 1:41:50.800]  that Epstein had of this.
[1:41:50.800 --> 1:41:51.960]  Where is all that?
[1:41:51.960 --> 1:41:54.760]  What is the big breaking news, Roger Stone?
[1:41:54.760 --> 1:41:57.040]  Well, Alex, first of all, those who've been following
[1:41:57.040 --> 1:42:00.120]  implores over the long term, first heard about Jeffrey
[1:42:00.120 --> 1:42:01.400]  Epstein right here.
[1:42:01.400 --> 1:42:05.920]  In fact, nothing you have learned about this overnight
[1:42:05.920 --> 1:42:09.520]  billionaire pedophile in the last 18 months
[1:42:09.520 --> 1:42:13.600]  was not in my book, The Clinton's War on Women, in 2016.
[1:42:13.600 --> 1:42:14.120]  That's right.
[1:42:14.120 --> 1:42:18.520]  The Bill Clinton's 28 trips on the low lead express.
[1:42:18.520 --> 1:42:22.560]  Which was a blueprint for Trump to go after Clinton
[1:42:22.560 --> 1:42:23.920]  when he put out fake allegations
[1:42:23.920 --> 1:42:25.320]  against the president and candidate.
[1:42:25.320 --> 1:42:27.640]  That's why they really hate your ass.
[1:42:27.640 --> 1:42:28.760]  There is no question.
[1:42:28.760 --> 1:42:30.880]  And the fact that two of the prosecutors in my case
[1:42:30.880 --> 1:42:33.760]  are closely affiliated with Hillary Clinton,
[1:42:33.760 --> 1:42:37.320]  the two lead prosecutors, show you that my prosecution
[1:42:37.320 --> 1:42:40.560]  is a vindication, is a retribution play.
[1:42:40.560 --> 1:42:42.840]  And it's over my book on Jeffrey Epstein.
[1:42:42.840 --> 1:42:45.080]  Now, let's be very clear.
[1:42:45.080 --> 1:42:48.840]  Epstein was first convicted in Florida
[1:42:48.840 --> 1:42:52.040]  when the Palm Beach City police conducted
[1:42:52.040 --> 1:42:55.040]  an extensive undercover investigation.
[1:42:55.040 --> 1:42:58.240]  And they were prepared and they handed the state prosecutor
[1:42:58.240 --> 1:43:01.320]  an open-shut case for child sex trafficking,
[1:43:01.320 --> 1:43:05.080]  child exploitation, and the kind of crimes
[1:43:05.080 --> 1:43:07.680]  that end you up in prison forever.
[1:43:07.680 --> 1:43:11.400]  The state's attorney ended up charging Epstein
[1:43:11.400 --> 1:43:14.760]  with one count of solicitation.
[1:43:14.760 --> 1:43:18.720]  The police chief, who was a very honest guy, was outraged.
[1:43:18.720 --> 1:43:21.200]  He went to the U.S. attorney for this district
[1:43:21.200 --> 1:43:22.800]  and said, something's wrong.
[1:43:22.800 --> 1:43:24.760]  Either the prosecutor has been threatened
[1:43:24.760 --> 1:43:26.000]  or he's been paid.
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:29.720]  But we handed him an airtight case for child sex trafficking,
[1:43:29.720 --> 1:43:32.600]  the exploitation of at least 33 children
[1:43:32.600 --> 1:43:34.640]  who were still in the jurisdiction.
[1:43:34.640 --> 1:43:37.040]  And he took a dive.
[1:43:37.040 --> 1:43:40.040]  The U.S. attorney, whose name was Acosta,
[1:43:40.040 --> 1:43:42.360]  conducted his own investigation.
[1:43:42.360 --> 1:43:45.720]  And then he simply rubber-stamped the state investigation
[1:43:45.720 --> 1:43:47.760]  and sealed it, hoping that none of us
[1:43:47.760 --> 1:43:50.120]  would ever know what really happened.
[1:43:50.120 --> 1:43:54.200]  When he was later appointed secretary of labor
[1:43:54.200 --> 1:43:58.080]  and was asked, what about your handling of Jeffrey Epstein?
[1:43:58.080 --> 1:43:59.680]  He said, and I quote,
[1:43:59.680 --> 1:44:02.800]  well, he's in the intelligence community.
[1:44:02.800 --> 1:44:04.120]  It's their problem,
[1:44:04.120 --> 1:44:06.560]  which I think explains the situation here.
[1:44:06.560 --> 1:44:09.880]  Now, I know some say that Epstein was Mossad.
[1:44:09.880 --> 1:44:11.680]  My research does not indicate that.
[1:44:11.680 --> 1:44:14.640]  My research indicates he had worked for the Mossad.
[1:44:14.640 --> 1:44:16.480]  He'd also worked for the United States.
[1:44:16.480 --> 1:44:18.600]  He had worked for anybody with money.
[1:44:18.600 --> 1:44:21.720]  That's right, he was a triple agent contractor
[1:44:21.720 --> 1:44:24.440]  just going around setting people up.
[1:44:24.440 --> 1:44:27.960]  Right, and the blackmail was the entire game here.
[1:44:27.960 --> 1:44:29.520]  Now, it's funny to watch liberals
[1:44:29.520 --> 1:44:31.600]  try to call him a Trump associate
[1:44:31.600 --> 1:44:34.600]  because they ran in the same social circles.
[1:44:34.600 --> 1:44:37.360]  But Donald Trump never visited his island.
[1:44:37.360 --> 1:44:39.800]  And Donald Trump never went to any of his parties.
[1:44:39.800 --> 1:44:41.040]  Donald Trump was never on his airplane.
[1:44:41.040 --> 1:44:45.040]  But Bill Gates did and Bill Clinton did over and over again.
[1:44:45.040 --> 1:44:47.200]  Turns out Bill Gates would literally stay with him
[1:44:47.200 --> 1:44:48.600]  sometimes for weeks on end.
[1:44:49.600 --> 1:44:52.000]  And as I first revealed,
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:54.040]  I think Bill was going to the island
[1:44:54.040 --> 1:44:58.280]  because of his affair with just Lane Maxwell.
[1:44:58.280 --> 1:44:59.840]  That's the connection.
[1:44:59.840 --> 1:45:02.360]  They were having a torrid affair,
[1:45:02.360 --> 1:45:06.640]  both in New York and in the Virgin Islands.
[1:45:06.640 --> 1:45:09.720]  And it is absolutely true what you say
[1:45:09.720 --> 1:45:13.240]  regarding the U.S. Attorney, Jeffrey Berman,
[1:45:13.240 --> 1:45:15.760]  who was fired by Attorney General Barr
[1:45:15.760 --> 1:45:17.240]  roughly 10 days ago.
[1:45:18.560 --> 1:45:21.720]  The mainstream fake news media was trying to say
[1:45:21.720 --> 1:45:25.480]  that Berman was fired because of his intense investigations
[1:45:25.480 --> 1:45:27.920]  into Donald Trump's businesses.
[1:45:27.920 --> 1:45:30.520]  But that is a fake news lie.
[1:45:30.520 --> 1:45:32.600]  The truth is Berman was fired
[1:45:32.600 --> 1:45:36.720]  because he was opposed to the arrest of just Lane Maxwell
[1:45:36.720 --> 1:45:39.080]  and because he refuses to move forward
[1:45:39.080 --> 1:45:42.680]  on the Anthony Weiner laptop case.
[1:45:42.680 --> 1:45:46.760]  You'll remember that as the case where Huma Abedin,
[1:45:46.760 --> 1:45:51.040]  the right-hand henchwoman of Hillary Clinton,
[1:45:51.040 --> 1:45:55.520]  forwarded over 600,000 emails, some of them classified,
[1:45:55.520 --> 1:46:00.200]  to a computer jointly used by her and her pedophile husband,
[1:46:00.200 --> 1:46:02.840]  former Congressman Anthony Weiner.
[1:46:02.840 --> 1:46:05.440]  And it is thought that this was her blackmail file.
[1:46:05.440 --> 1:46:08.200]  This was her insurance file.
[1:46:08.200 --> 1:46:10.280]  Officers with the New York Police Department
[1:46:10.280 --> 1:46:12.640]  who are initially found this material
[1:46:12.640 --> 1:46:16.280]  in a routine investigation into Weiner
[1:46:16.280 --> 1:46:20.160]  for sex texting underage girls
[1:46:20.160 --> 1:46:22.560]  and immediately reported it to the FBI.
[1:46:22.560 --> 1:46:27.560]  But NYPD sources have told me that these videos
[1:46:27.920 --> 1:46:32.520]  include evidence of graft, corruption, child exploitation,
[1:46:32.520 --> 1:46:34.280]  the torture of children.
[1:46:34.280 --> 1:46:37.480]  It really sounds like a treasure trove of information.
[1:46:37.480 --> 1:46:39.440]  And what nine of the 12 police officers
[1:46:39.440 --> 1:46:41.040]  that saw the videos are dead.
[1:46:41.040 --> 1:46:43.600]  Reportedly, it's children being tortured to death.
[1:46:43.600 --> 1:46:45.040]  They say it's so horrible.
[1:46:45.040 --> 1:46:47.760]  And even General Flynn's lawyer is very respected.
[1:46:47.760 --> 1:46:50.360]  She's met with these very people that have served.
[1:46:50.360 --> 1:46:51.880]  They told her point like they said,
[1:46:51.880 --> 1:46:54.960]  no, it's literally beyond pedophilia.
[1:46:54.960 --> 1:46:56.360]  It's chopping kids up.
[1:46:57.560 --> 1:46:59.280]  It certainly sounds that way.
[1:46:59.280 --> 1:47:04.280]  So there's no question that if she wants to bargain,
[1:47:04.280 --> 1:47:07.720]  just letting Maxwell has a lot to bargain with because her
[1:47:07.720 --> 1:47:11.320]  mentor, she was basically a procurer.
[1:47:11.320 --> 1:47:14.680]  She would cruise the bus stations,
[1:47:14.680 --> 1:47:17.680]  the train station looking for runaways
[1:47:17.680 --> 1:47:20.360]  who would then be groomed for Epstein's own
[1:47:20.360 --> 1:47:22.040]  sexual gratification.
[1:47:22.040 --> 1:47:23.400]  And then when he got tired of them,
[1:47:23.400 --> 1:47:26.120]  he would farm them out to his friends like
[1:47:26.120 --> 1:47:28.760]  former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell
[1:47:28.760 --> 1:47:32.840]  or former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson
[1:47:32.840 --> 1:47:35.840]  or the scientist Stephen Hawking.
[1:47:35.840 --> 1:47:39.920]  That's really disgusting or who knows?
[1:47:39.920 --> 1:47:42.400]  I mean, I think this list is extensive.
[1:47:42.400 --> 1:47:46.160]  It includes politicians, people in the financial world,
[1:47:46.160 --> 1:47:50.720]  athletes, this guy was keeping tape on everyone,
[1:47:50.720 --> 1:47:53.680]  which is why I believe he was murdered.
[1:47:53.680 --> 1:47:56.400]  But I'm not saying he was murdered by the Clintons.
[1:47:56.400 --> 1:47:59.520]  I'm saying there were many, many, many people
[1:47:59.520 --> 1:48:04.200]  and many institutions that had an interest in silencing him.
[1:48:04.200 --> 1:48:07.840]  So how coincidental the videos just happened to be turned
[1:48:07.840 --> 1:48:10.360]  off, the guards just happened to be asleep.
[1:48:10.360 --> 1:48:12.640]  I mean, it's insulting really for anyone to think.
[1:48:12.640 --> 1:48:13.800]  Well, that's the next question.
[1:48:13.800 --> 1:48:18.200]  How long do you think she's going to be alive?
[1:48:18.200 --> 1:48:20.240]  They're claiming they have the best security team
[1:48:20.240 --> 1:48:23.520]  ever monitoring her every move to keep her safe right now?
[1:48:25.120 --> 1:48:28.000]  Well, I think that depends on what she does.
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:29.560]  I mean, we don't know whether she's already agreed
[1:48:29.560 --> 1:48:30.400]  to cooperate.
[1:48:30.400 --> 1:48:32.960]  We don't know if she is holding back some old cards.
[1:48:32.960 --> 1:48:34.000]  Here's what I do know.
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:37.440]  My new attorney, David Shown, one of my two attorneys,
[1:48:37.440 --> 1:48:42.400]  really an excellent attorney, very brilliant, very aggressive.
[1:48:42.400 --> 1:48:46.200]  He had been retained by Epstein for his defense.
[1:48:46.200 --> 1:48:49.520]  Epstein paid him on a Thursday,
[1:48:49.520 --> 1:48:53.280]  made arrangements for him to move to New York on Friday
[1:48:53.280 --> 1:48:55.320]  and Epstein died Saturday.
[1:48:55.320 --> 1:48:57.640]  Does that sound like a man who killed himself?
[1:48:57.640 --> 1:48:58.480]  No.
[1:48:59.440 --> 1:49:00.880]  Well, in fact, Epstein's lawyer,
[1:49:00.880 --> 1:49:04.120]  I guess you have his lawyer, he's come out and said
[1:49:04.120 --> 1:49:05.800]  Epstein thought he was going to be killed.
[1:49:05.800 --> 1:49:07.400]  Is that the same lawyer?
[1:49:07.400 --> 1:49:08.280]  Yes, indeed.
[1:49:08.280 --> 1:49:09.120]  Wow.
[1:49:09.120 --> 1:49:11.280]  Now, everybody's entitled to a lawyer.
[1:49:11.280 --> 1:49:12.120]  No, I get it.
[1:49:12.120 --> 1:49:13.720]  Everybody's, you're not bad to have a great defense.
[1:49:13.720 --> 1:49:14.560]  That's how it works.
[1:49:14.560 --> 1:49:16.000]  No, I understand that, yeah.
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:19.120]  Well, I wish I'd had the same lawyers at trial, frankly,
[1:49:19.120 --> 1:49:22.280]  where I'm still confounded about the fact that,
[1:49:22.280 --> 1:49:25.080]  for example, Steve Bannon was the government's
[1:49:25.080 --> 1:49:26.520]  surprise star witness.
[1:49:26.520 --> 1:49:28.480]  And why is he constantly hanging out?
[1:49:28.480 --> 1:49:30.440]  Oh, that's another, we'll cover that in a moment.
[1:49:30.440 --> 1:49:31.560]  Yeah, let's get back to this.
[1:49:31.560 --> 1:49:33.760]  He told the Senate, well, explain,
[1:49:33.760 --> 1:49:35.960]  his perjury's cut and dried.
[1:49:35.960 --> 1:49:36.800]  It's really simple.
[1:49:36.800 --> 1:49:39.720]  He testified before the House Intelligence Committee.
[1:49:39.720 --> 1:49:42.880]  That testimony was classified until about a month ago.
[1:49:42.880 --> 1:49:44.880]  He told the House Committee he never discussed
[1:49:44.880 --> 1:49:49.600]  WikiLeaks with me ever on any occasion at all in 2016.
[1:49:49.600 --> 1:49:53.080]  Yet he showed up at my trial as a surprise witness for Mueller
[1:49:53.080 --> 1:49:55.200]  and now he said, Stone and I talked about it
[1:49:55.200 --> 1:49:58.600]  in every conversation we had in 2016.
[1:49:58.600 --> 1:50:02.200]  I considered Roger Stone our access point to WikiLeaks,
[1:50:02.200 --> 1:50:03.800]  which would be news to me.
[1:50:03.800 --> 1:50:05.240]  So what's the truth on Bannon?
[1:50:05.240 --> 1:50:07.600]  Because I mean, why is he hanging out with Epstein?
[1:50:08.920 --> 1:50:10.960]  It's very, because I think he is a globalist.
[1:50:10.960 --> 1:50:12.280]  I mean, when I did the research,
[1:50:12.280 --> 1:50:15.880]  every one of the major anti-Trump globalists
[1:50:15.880 --> 1:50:18.200]  who weaseled their way into the administration,
[1:50:18.200 --> 1:50:23.200]  HR McMaster, Rex Pillarson, every one of them,
[1:50:23.200 --> 1:50:27.480]  you can trace the patronage right to Steve Bannon.
[1:50:27.480 --> 1:50:30.640]  So he may go on TV where he's stolen the name
[1:50:30.640 --> 1:50:34.640]  of the radio show started by Owen Shroyer myself,
[1:50:34.640 --> 1:50:35.600]  The War Room.
[1:50:35.600 --> 1:50:38.400]  I guess we should call ours The Real War Room.
[1:50:38.400 --> 1:50:40.880]  But he talks the talk, but he doesn't walk the walk.
[1:50:40.880 --> 1:50:44.000]  I mean, you know, the guy, first of all,
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:45.800]  when it comes to personal appearance,
[1:50:45.800 --> 1:50:49.560]  the guy has pioneered the whole idea of hobo chic.
[1:50:49.560 --> 1:50:50.400]  He looks like he changed out.
[1:50:50.400 --> 1:50:54.960]  He's pioneered, he looks like a reanimated corpse.
[1:50:54.960 --> 1:50:55.800]  He looks like a dead body.
[1:50:55.800 --> 1:50:57.800]  Let's do five more minutes, we gotta go.
[1:50:57.800 --> 1:51:00.040]  But I want to talk about what's happening
[1:51:00.040 --> 1:51:01.440]  in the campaign COVID-19.
[1:51:01.440 --> 1:51:05.080]  We think Trump should do seven days out, Roger.
[1:51:05.080 --> 1:51:06.640]  I'm so glad your new attorney tells you
[1:51:06.640 --> 1:51:07.480]  go out to interviews.
[1:51:07.480 --> 1:51:09.280]  Yes, I'd love that advice.
[1:51:09.280 --> 1:51:11.520]  My God, the whole thing is about shutting you up.
[1:51:11.520 --> 1:51:14.760]  What a crime with 118 days left.
[1:51:14.760 --> 1:51:19.760]  They want to make the 111 last days with no Roger Stone.
[1:51:19.760 --> 1:51:20.760]  That's not American.
[1:51:22.760 --> 1:51:24.520]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[1:51:24.520 --> 1:51:25.520]  You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[1:51:25.520 --> 1:51:26.520]  Yeah, hello. Can you hear me?
[1:51:26.520 --> 1:51:27.600]  I sure can, sir. Thank you.
[1:51:27.600 --> 1:51:29.200]  Hey, Alex. Before I start, man,
[1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:31.360]  I just wanted to talk to you, bro,
[1:51:31.360 --> 1:51:34.400]  and it's a pleasure to be talking right now with you, man.
[1:51:34.400 --> 1:51:35.960]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[1:51:35.960 --> 1:51:37.520]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut,
[1:51:37.520 --> 1:51:39.520]  and I just want to plug in.
[1:51:39.520 --> 1:51:43.000]  I'm a truck driver, and two before us have changed.
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:46.320]  The way I drive, me and my brothers drive.
[1:51:46.320 --> 1:51:47.560]  There's a couple of us.
[1:51:47.560 --> 1:51:51.240]  We are Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[1:51:51.240 --> 1:51:55.240]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rolla,
[1:51:55.240 --> 1:51:57.440]  and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking
[1:51:57.440 --> 1:52:00.040]  all that sugar, and I just want to thank you for that, man.
[1:52:00.040 --> 1:52:01.720]  Well, brother, we put more in this
[1:52:01.720 --> 1:52:05.640]  than any other long-term high-quality energy powder there is.
[1:52:05.640 --> 1:52:07.960]  So this was designed on one of the top guys in the country.
[1:52:07.960 --> 1:52:08.880]  He didn't want his name on it
[1:52:08.880 --> 1:52:10.400]  because obviously the political issues,
[1:52:10.400 --> 1:52:12.200]  but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation
[1:52:12.200 --> 1:52:13.040]  just for the design of it.
[1:52:13.040 --> 1:52:15.200]  And we believe it is the best, strongest,
[1:52:15.200 --> 1:52:17.840]  but healthiest energy out there, and you're saying
[1:52:17.840 --> 1:52:18.920]  that it's made your life better,
[1:52:18.920 --> 1:52:19.760]  so that means a lot to me.
[1:52:19.760 --> 1:52:21.000]  Thank you to all your truck drivers.
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:21.840]  We love you.
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:26.600]  The 4th of July, 2020.
[1:52:26.600 --> 1:52:30.520]  We are here, and despite all the globalist attacks,
[1:52:30.520 --> 1:52:32.640]  you, the viewers and listeners of this transmission
[1:52:32.640 --> 1:52:35.800]  have supported us by prayer, by word of mouth,
[1:52:35.800 --> 1:52:39.040]  and by buying the products, and you have done all of this.
[1:52:39.040 --> 1:52:42.640]  So when you look at the huge effect Info Awards has had,
[1:52:42.640 --> 1:52:45.560]  I want you to understand that it's because
[1:52:45.560 --> 1:52:49.680]  of what you have done, and myself and the whole crew
[1:52:49.680 --> 1:52:53.760]  salute you on this July 4th, 2020.
[1:52:53.760 --> 1:52:55.440]  We've got a lot of our best-selling products
[1:52:55.440 --> 1:52:57.280]  that were sold out, DNA Force Plus,
[1:52:57.280 --> 1:53:00.240]  Bodies, Ultra 12, and others that have been sold out
[1:53:00.240 --> 1:53:05.240]  for months, back in stock, 50% off for the 4th of July.
[1:53:05.520 --> 1:53:07.080]  We're running a special, I want to encourage you
[1:53:07.080 --> 1:53:09.240]  to get these products because they have enriched
[1:53:09.240 --> 1:53:12.160]  my life so much, I know they'll enrich your life,
[1:53:12.160 --> 1:53:14.520]  and regardless, it's a total 360 win
[1:53:14.520 --> 1:53:16.720]  because it funds the Info Award.
[1:53:16.720 --> 1:53:19.240]  The only way we fail is when you don't take action.
[1:53:19.240 --> 1:53:20.400]  I don't need to tell you that.
[1:53:20.400 --> 1:53:23.040]  You already took action, and I salute and thank you.
[1:53:25.680 --> 1:53:28.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:53:32.880 --> 1:53:37.000]  What I hate is looking up and seeing
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:42.000]  the chemtrails in a clear blue sky today.
[1:53:45.080 --> 1:53:50.080]  What I hate is hitting those blocks
[1:53:50.600 --> 1:53:53.720]  on a highway in my way.
[1:53:55.320 --> 1:53:58.840]  We are back live, we are broadcasting worldwide.
[1:53:58.840 --> 1:54:01.800]  All right, Roger Stone, who I'd like to try
[1:54:01.800 --> 1:54:04.040]  to get on every day we can before they try
[1:54:04.040 --> 1:54:05.800]  to throw his ass in prison.
[1:54:05.800 --> 1:54:07.520]  There's so much big news, the campaign,
[1:54:07.520 --> 1:54:09.200]  other key points you wanna make, the sort of time we have,
[1:54:09.200 --> 1:54:11.400]  but separately, Trump's gotta give you clemency.
[1:54:11.400 --> 1:54:13.160]  He's signaled he's gonna do it,
[1:54:13.160 --> 1:54:15.240]  but why not go with the full pardon?
[1:54:15.240 --> 1:54:17.720]  Why not double down, get in their face,
[1:54:17.720 --> 1:54:21.040]  and literally make you a campaign advisor or something?
[1:54:21.040 --> 1:54:22.000]  I know you don't even want that.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:23.400]  You like to be informal do whatever you want
[1:54:23.400 --> 1:54:25.080]  as a free agent, but I just think we need
[1:54:25.080 --> 1:54:26.040]  to start doubling down.
[1:54:26.040 --> 1:54:27.320]  America wants that.
[1:54:27.320 --> 1:54:28.600]  They want us to own it.
[1:54:28.600 --> 1:54:30.720]  They want us to just get back in their face
[1:54:30.720 --> 1:54:32.720]  and stop groveling, does that make sense?
[1:54:32.720 --> 1:54:37.720]  Roger, we got a little bit of technical difficulty.
[1:54:38.360 --> 1:54:39.720]  We're going right back to Roger here
[1:54:39.720 --> 1:54:42.360]  as soon as we get him here in a moment.
[1:54:42.360 --> 1:54:43.800]  I think you thought that was a four minute break,
[1:54:43.800 --> 1:54:45.400]  it's a two minute break, they're at the end of the hour.
[1:54:45.400 --> 1:54:49.720]  Roger, 2020 election advice to the president.
[1:54:49.720 --> 1:54:51.520]  What's your comments to the president
[1:54:51.520 --> 1:54:54.120]  and why not just get a pardon instead of just a clemency,
[1:54:54.120 --> 1:54:54.960]  Roger?
[1:54:54.960 --> 1:54:57.400]  They didn't want to fire that, it just makes no sense.
[1:54:57.400 --> 1:54:58.640]  Some things said they weren't gonna.
[1:54:58.640 --> 1:55:01.800]  Yeah, I think they may have lost audio to us,
[1:55:01.800 --> 1:55:03.200]  and hey, that's the great part about Skype.
[1:55:03.200 --> 1:55:05.080]  Like you're talking to Mars, you're talking to Venus,
[1:55:05.080 --> 1:55:07.240]  you're talking to Pluto, you're talking to moon,
[1:55:07.240 --> 1:55:08.280]  you're talking to Antarctica,
[1:55:08.280 --> 1:55:10.640]  you're talking to the Kepler elves,
[1:55:10.640 --> 1:55:13.040]  you're talking to the Easter Bunny.
[1:55:13.040 --> 1:55:16.560]  I think they probably just have lost the feed from us.
[1:55:16.560 --> 1:55:18.800]  So that happens, it's the fun of Skype.
[1:55:18.800 --> 1:55:22.640]  Roger is a great political operative, a good guy,
[1:55:22.640 --> 1:55:26.120]  but he is technical stuff, which is understandable.
[1:55:26.120 --> 1:55:29.320]  But in this whole COVID world now, we're all learning
[1:55:29.320 --> 1:55:31.800]  how to get all of our stuff a little bit better.
[1:55:32.960 --> 1:55:36.040]  So he may, this is interesting,
[1:55:36.040 --> 1:55:37.680]  let's just put Roger on screen.
[1:55:37.680 --> 1:55:39.240]  He doesn't even know he's on air.
[1:55:39.240 --> 1:55:40.240]  Hey, Roger.
[1:55:41.760 --> 1:55:42.720]  Yes, sir.
[1:55:42.720 --> 1:55:44.680]  Hey, you're awesome, I know that's only a two minute break,
[1:55:44.680 --> 1:55:47.280]  sir, we should have told you, not a four minute break,
[1:55:47.280 --> 1:55:50.680]  but at the time we have left, why not get a full pardon?
[1:55:50.680 --> 1:55:54.120]  Why shouldn't Trump just double down and go all the way?
[1:55:54.120 --> 1:55:56.840]  Well, that is entirely up to the president,
[1:55:56.840 --> 1:56:00.240]  but in all honesty, I would like to fight for exoneration.
[1:56:00.240 --> 1:56:03.000]  I'd like to be formally vindicated,
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:06.560]  but the problem here is I have to live long enough to do that.
[1:56:06.560 --> 1:56:08.640]  So those while meeting patriots who say,
[1:56:08.640 --> 1:56:11.760]  look, Stone can just go to jail for four or five months
[1:56:11.760 --> 1:56:13.400]  and then be pardoned after the election.
[1:56:13.400 --> 1:56:15.080]  I don't think they understand.
[1:56:15.080 --> 1:56:18.000]  I won't be alive after the election, if that happens,
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:22.200]  and therefore the pardon, the appeal would die with me.
[1:56:22.200 --> 1:56:24.800]  The reason that it's essential that I get to appeal
[1:56:24.800 --> 1:56:28.200]  beyond my own exoneration, Alex, is my appeal,
[1:56:28.200 --> 1:56:32.400]  if ever heard, will fully expose the misconduct of the judge,
[1:56:32.400 --> 1:56:34.640]  the corruption of at least two jurors,
[1:56:34.640 --> 1:56:35.480]  and it'll be clear-
[1:56:35.480 --> 1:56:38.120]  Sure, you need to expose to fully exonerate yourself,
[1:56:38.120 --> 1:56:40.160]  not just get a pardon, but if you get a clemency,
[1:56:40.160 --> 1:56:42.280]  then you can go through the process then,
[1:56:42.280 --> 1:56:44.280]  and I guess expose the fraud.
[1:56:44.280 --> 1:56:45.480]  That's precisely the point,
[1:56:45.480 --> 1:56:48.040]  whereas a pardon, that ends the whole thing.
[1:56:48.040 --> 1:56:52.080]  So a commutation or a pardon, obviously I pray for either one
[1:56:52.080 --> 1:56:55.000]  because my wife is 73 years old,
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:58.200]  she's deaf and she has rheumatoid arthritis.
[1:56:58.200 --> 1:56:59.720]  She's a beautiful woman,
[1:56:59.720 --> 1:57:01.520]  she's the greatest thing that ever happened to me
[1:57:01.520 --> 1:57:03.400]  other than finding Christ,
[1:57:03.400 --> 1:57:05.080]  but I don't know who's going to support her.
[1:57:05.080 --> 1:57:07.840]  By the way, your wife is the best looking 70-year-old woman
[1:57:07.840 --> 1:57:09.240]  I've ever seen.
[1:57:09.240 --> 1:57:11.240]  I've had dinner with her a few times.
[1:57:11.240 --> 1:57:12.560]  You got your real hottie right there.
[1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:15.400]  I bet she was a firecracker back in the day, huh?
[1:57:15.400 --> 1:57:16.760]  She still is a firecracker.
[1:57:16.760 --> 1:57:19.440]  So the point, and she'll be very angry with me
[1:57:19.440 --> 1:57:20.880]  for telling people how old she is,
[1:57:20.880 --> 1:57:22.960]  which will be very happy with you
[1:57:22.960 --> 1:57:24.120]  for saying how great she looks.
[1:57:24.120 --> 1:57:27.680]  So the point is, I lost everything in this fight.
[1:57:27.680 --> 1:57:28.880]  You're going through it.
[1:57:28.880 --> 1:57:31.040]  I lost my home, I lost my insurance,
[1:57:31.040 --> 1:57:34.200]  I lost my savings, I lost my car, I lost my voice.
[1:57:34.200 --> 1:57:36.760]  I lost my ability to make a living.
[1:57:36.760 --> 1:57:39.280]  That they want to silence you while they're lynching you.
[1:57:39.280 --> 1:57:40.720]  Yeah, they're sending a message with you.
[1:57:40.720 --> 1:57:43.080]  That's what we've got to support you.
[1:57:43.080 --> 1:57:46.560]  So people need to go to stonedefensefund.com,
[1:57:46.560 --> 1:57:48.520]  stonedefensefund.com.
[1:57:48.520 --> 1:57:51.080]  People need to go to the infowars.com site
[1:57:51.080 --> 1:57:52.360]  and get themselves a,
[1:57:52.360 --> 1:57:54.400]  Roger Stone did nothing wrong t-shirt,
[1:57:54.400 --> 1:57:56.480]  the special info wars edition,
[1:57:56.480 --> 1:58:00.240]  which I swear to you will end up in the Smithsonian eventually.
[1:58:00.240 --> 1:58:01.680]  And they're not going to be any more of them.
[1:58:01.680 --> 1:58:03.880]  It's a limited edition, folks, so go.
[1:58:03.880 --> 1:58:07.120]  Roger, you could still be thrown in jail in seven days.
[1:58:07.120 --> 1:58:08.520]  If Trump doesn't give you clemency,
[1:58:08.520 --> 1:58:10.120]  I'm going to get major pissed.
[1:58:10.120 --> 1:58:12.160]  I know we think he is going to do it to the right thing.
[1:58:12.160 --> 1:58:13.080]  I know you got to go.
[1:58:13.080 --> 1:58:15.000]  Let's talk again very, very soon.
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:17.240]  Come back tomorrow if you've got time, please.
[1:58:17.240 --> 1:58:19.160]  Well, Alex, the most important thing for you to do
[1:58:19.160 --> 1:58:22.240]  is to bring this to begin the countdown again,
[1:58:22.240 --> 1:58:24.400]  because otherwise people don't recognize
[1:58:24.400 --> 1:58:25.600]  how short term this is.
[1:58:25.600 --> 1:58:27.400]  So please begin the countdown.
[1:58:27.400 --> 1:58:29.080]  Oh yeah, you're the baddest test to arrest everybody.
[1:58:29.080 --> 1:58:30.080]  We got to save you.
[1:58:30.080 --> 1:58:30.920]  All right, Roger, we love.
[1:58:30.920 --> 1:58:34.600]  The fourth of July, 2020 special has gone into high gear.

[1:59:25.360 --> 1:59:27.520]  I thank you for your continued prayer,
[1:59:27.520 --> 1:59:29.280]  your focus, and your support.
[1:59:29.280 --> 1:59:30.680]  Again, I salute you all.
[1:59:30.680 --> 1:59:52.560]  MUSIC
[1:59:52.560 --> 1:59:55.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are excited to have
[1:59:55.120 --> 1:59:57.120]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown on.
[1:59:57.120 --> 2:00:00.360]  He's got a huge, great church in Florida,
[2:00:00.360 --> 2:00:03.720]  and he was one of the first major pastors to say,
[2:00:03.720 --> 2:00:05.760]  we're gonna have our meetings, we're essential.
[2:00:05.760 --> 2:00:09.000]  Well, now Black Lives Matter and Antifa are essential,
[2:00:09.000 --> 2:00:12.480]  and the mayor of New York, we played it last hour, said,
[2:00:13.440 --> 2:00:15.960]  churches are not essential, they're apples and oranges.
[2:00:15.960 --> 2:00:19.800]  Black Lives Matter, which is run by Soros is,
[2:00:19.800 --> 2:00:22.360]  and then they sent Black Lives Matter individuals
[2:00:22.360 --> 2:00:24.800]  to start fights to a Baptist church in New York
[2:00:24.800 --> 2:00:26.640]  because they're one that didn't shut down.
[2:00:26.640 --> 2:00:29.480]  I mean, this is just brazen communism,
[2:00:29.480 --> 2:00:31.720]  brazen malice youth brigades.
[2:00:31.720 --> 2:00:33.200]  Well, it gets crazier.
[2:00:33.200 --> 2:00:34.800]  They're not just censoring, trying to keep him
[2:00:34.800 --> 2:00:36.400]  from having his services.
[2:00:36.400 --> 2:00:40.240]  They arrested him for it, and then last week,
[2:00:40.240 --> 2:00:42.800]  Rodney and I was about to click on it and buy it and read it.
[2:00:42.800 --> 2:00:46.560]  The phantom virus, how an unseen enemy shut down the planet.
[2:00:49.800 --> 2:00:53.600]  Amazon banned him selling the book, but you can still get it.
[2:00:53.600 --> 2:00:56.760]  I mean, talk about dangerous, talk about authoritarianism.
[2:00:56.760 --> 2:00:59.000]  Communist, that's what Black Lives Matter is.
[2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:02.360]  Marching and taking over Baptist churches in New York.
[2:01:02.360 --> 2:01:04.600]  Mayors of major cities sing,
[2:01:04.600 --> 2:01:06.960]  Christianity and churches aren't essential,
[2:01:06.960 --> 2:01:09.080]  but communist movements are.
[2:01:09.080 --> 2:01:12.120]  This is truly evil, so he joins us here,
[2:01:12.120 --> 2:01:14.520]  been trying to get him on for a long time, revival.com.
[2:01:14.520 --> 2:01:16.840]  He does hundreds of prayer meetings around the country
[2:01:16.840 --> 2:01:18.440]  and the world every year.
[2:01:18.440 --> 2:01:21.720]  He's a workhorse, a great guy, and he has a lot of courage.
[2:01:21.720 --> 2:01:23.880]  He's also, you've gone and prayed with Trump at the White House
[2:01:23.880 --> 2:01:26.320]  and done a great job on that, revival.com, the new book,
[2:01:26.320 --> 2:01:29.680]  The Phantom Virus, How An Unseen Enemy Shut Down the Planet.
[2:01:29.680 --> 2:01:30.960]  He joins us now.
[2:01:30.960 --> 2:01:32.840]  What are we facing, Pastor?
[2:01:34.520 --> 2:01:36.640]  Well, you know, if you remember,
[2:01:36.640 --> 2:01:39.120]  but first of all, let me say good to see you.
[2:01:39.120 --> 2:01:43.680]  You know, it's basically a communist takeover of the planet.
[2:01:43.680 --> 2:01:45.920]  Now I'd written the book, The Killing of Uncle Sam
[2:01:45.920 --> 2:01:47.360]  and then Killing the Planet.
[2:01:47.360 --> 2:01:49.880]  I came out with this in January on socialism
[2:01:49.880 --> 2:01:51.360]  under the microscope.
[2:01:51.360 --> 2:01:54.360]  And then I did a tour through Australasia,
[2:01:54.360 --> 2:01:57.680]  actually left on Super Bowl Sunday.
[2:01:57.680 --> 2:02:01.120]  We went Tampa Strait to Hilo, onto Fiji, New Zealand,
[2:02:01.120 --> 2:02:04.360]  and then 10 cities across Australia.
[2:02:04.360 --> 2:02:07.360]  By the time I hit Singapore, this thing was crazy.
[2:02:07.360 --> 2:02:08.840]  COVID was nuts.
[2:02:08.840 --> 2:02:10.600]  They would take anybody's temperature.
[2:02:10.600 --> 2:02:12.960]  I then went to Jakarta, onto Bali,
[2:02:12.960 --> 2:02:15.200]  General Santos, and the Philippines, Manila.
[2:02:15.200 --> 2:02:16.640]  People were gonna go on to Micronesia.
[2:02:16.640 --> 2:02:18.080]  They shut the country down.
[2:02:18.080 --> 2:02:20.000]  I came straight to Honolulu
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:22.480]  and then I got back home on the Saturday night.
[2:02:22.480 --> 2:02:23.880]  I sent a message with the White House.
[2:02:23.880 --> 2:02:25.600]  I said, you better tell the president,
[2:02:25.600 --> 2:02:27.280]  you better get on the front end of this thing.
[2:02:27.280 --> 2:02:28.800]  It's coming like a train.
[2:02:28.800 --> 2:02:31.080]  And I realized what happened here
[2:02:31.080 --> 2:02:34.800]  is because he wouldn't sign the Paris Climate Agreement
[2:02:34.800 --> 2:02:37.320]  and they would give the offshore banking
[2:02:37.320 --> 2:02:39.640]  of $1.5 trillion a year.
[2:02:39.640 --> 2:02:42.800]  They said, oh, no problem, we'll bring the virus in
[2:02:42.800 --> 2:02:44.040]  and they will take over the world
[2:02:44.040 --> 2:02:46.080]  using the World Health Organization,
[2:02:46.080 --> 2:02:48.120]  which is funded by the Communist Party,
[2:02:48.120 --> 2:02:51.520]  Bill Gates and Fauci are all part of that.
[2:02:51.520 --> 2:02:53.760]  And so this, what we call a pandemic
[2:02:53.760 --> 2:02:55.120]  was already planned.
[2:02:55.120 --> 2:02:58.600]  As of fact, there was a plan laid out in 2006,
[2:02:58.600 --> 2:03:01.200]  but the Rockefeller Foundation
[2:03:01.200 --> 2:03:03.200]  did a whole document in 2010.
[2:03:03.200 --> 2:03:04.480]  And I, when I got back,
[2:03:04.480 --> 2:03:06.880]  I actually read it out publicly in the church
[2:03:06.880 --> 2:03:08.480]  that this was the plan,
[2:03:08.480 --> 2:03:11.240]  because I could already see it coming like a train smash.
[2:03:11.240 --> 2:03:16.240]  So, and who could believe that in a matter of moments,
[2:03:16.360 --> 2:03:18.360]  the whole world is shut down,
[2:03:18.360 --> 2:03:21.440]  and Hollywood fell, which I don't have a problem with that,
[2:03:21.440 --> 2:03:23.200]  but all the gods of America fell
[2:03:23.200 --> 2:03:24.600]  like in a matter of a week.
[2:03:24.600 --> 2:03:29.200]  I mean, Hollywood fell, the NFL, NBA, everything was dead,
[2:03:29.200 --> 2:03:32.240]  dead, it shut down the planet, everybody's afraid,
[2:03:32.240 --> 2:03:34.560]  and the media is running the thing out,
[2:03:34.560 --> 2:03:35.960]  everybody thinks they're gonna fall dead.
[2:03:35.960 --> 2:03:38.960]  I come from Africa, we have viruses all the time.
[2:03:38.960 --> 2:03:43.960]  I must have prayed for Ebola, yellow fever, H1N1, swine, AIDS.
[2:03:45.200 --> 2:03:49.600]  I mean, we live through all that kind of stuff.
[2:03:49.600 --> 2:03:51.800]  So I mean, I really, we studied this
[2:03:51.800 --> 2:03:53.880]  and that's why we brought this book out.
[2:03:53.880 --> 2:03:55.840]  And of course, when the hot copy comes out
[2:03:55.840 --> 2:03:57.200]  in the next week, I'll get you,
[2:03:57.200 --> 2:03:59.080]  I know you're gonna get some, but-
[2:03:59.080 --> 2:03:59.920]  Absolutely.
[2:03:59.920 --> 2:04:03.280]  What people don't understand, Alex,
[2:04:03.280 --> 2:04:06.280]  this is a communist taker of America.
[2:04:06.280 --> 2:04:08.840]  And of course, they say it's not an attack on church,
[2:04:08.840 --> 2:04:11.520]  but what I did was I flew a guy in from Texas,
[2:04:11.520 --> 2:04:14.840]  I bought machines, and I spent up 100,000.
[2:04:14.840 --> 2:04:18.560]  These machines destroy every virus in the air,
[2:04:18.560 --> 2:04:20.360]  not just in your lungs,
[2:04:20.360 --> 2:04:22.280]  but on your surface of your body.
[2:04:22.280 --> 2:04:24.480]  And I should only have two in the building.
[2:04:24.480 --> 2:04:26.080]  I have 13 in the building.
[2:04:26.080 --> 2:04:28.640]  You can actually do open heart surgery in our sanctuary.
[2:04:28.640 --> 2:04:31.200]  I mean, so when they said shut down,
[2:04:31.200 --> 2:04:32.400]  I said, I ain't shut down.
[2:04:32.400 --> 2:04:34.160]  I mean, I'm not shut neving down.
[2:04:34.160 --> 2:04:37.040]  So then I got arrested, which actually,
[2:04:37.040 --> 2:04:40.600]  there's my coffee mug with my mug shot on it.
[2:04:40.600 --> 2:04:41.600]  I love it.
[2:04:41.600 --> 2:04:43.280]  People wanted, says, Florida passed
[2:04:43.280 --> 2:04:45.040]  the arrest of holding services.
[2:04:45.040 --> 2:04:48.480]  And then it says, hashtag mug shot, hashtag Romans one,
[2:04:48.480 --> 2:04:52.640]  16, hashtag First Amendment, hashtag armed,
[2:04:52.640 --> 2:04:55.800]  wrote down, but so this has been so crazy,
[2:04:55.800 --> 2:04:58.040]  which actually I was at total peace
[2:04:58.040 --> 2:04:59.200]  when they came and arrested me
[2:04:59.200 --> 2:05:02.120]  because the sheriff said arrested me
[2:05:02.120 --> 2:05:03.720]  because I live an hour away.
[2:05:03.720 --> 2:05:05.680]  They said, look, we are sorry that we have to do this.
[2:05:05.680 --> 2:05:06.880]  I said, look, don't be sorry.
[2:05:06.880 --> 2:05:08.280]  I'm actually on it.
[2:05:08.280 --> 2:05:11.080]  I'm actually becoming an official American today
[2:05:11.080 --> 2:05:12.400]  because I come from another country.
[2:05:12.400 --> 2:05:15.360]  I raised my hand to defend the Constitution.
[2:05:15.360 --> 2:05:18.280]  And I'm actually being arrested for the first amendment.
[2:05:18.280 --> 2:05:19.840]  This is like epic.
[2:05:19.840 --> 2:05:21.880]  So they handcuffed me, of course,
[2:05:21.880 --> 2:05:24.280]  they did ask me if I was, when I came out, you know,
[2:05:24.280 --> 2:05:25.120]  I said, are you pecking?
[2:05:25.120 --> 2:05:26.200]  I said, really, Sheriff?
[2:05:26.200 --> 2:05:27.280]  Seriously?
[2:05:27.280 --> 2:05:28.480]  I'm gonna have a showdown.
[2:05:28.480 --> 2:05:30.640]  This is like some Western movie.
[2:05:30.640 --> 2:05:32.240]  So they put me in the back of the car,
[2:05:32.240 --> 2:05:33.560]  he handcuffed me from the front
[2:05:33.560 --> 2:05:35.600]  and I'm driving in the back of the police car,
[2:05:35.600 --> 2:05:37.200]  40 minutes to the detention center.
[2:05:37.200 --> 2:05:38.800]  I thought, this is like really strange.
[2:05:38.800 --> 2:05:41.000]  I never thought I'd see the side of it.
[2:05:41.000 --> 2:05:42.240]  And then I got there.
[2:05:42.240 --> 2:05:44.920]  They measured my temperature, maybe put a mask on.
[2:05:44.920 --> 2:05:45.960]  They made me sign an effort.
[2:05:45.960 --> 2:05:47.360]  David, I come through.
[2:05:47.360 --> 2:05:50.800]  The guy says, well, we need to get a mug shot.
[2:05:50.800 --> 2:05:52.720]  So I said, can I borrow those handcuffs from you?
[2:05:52.720 --> 2:05:54.000]  I said, I've never been arrested.
[2:05:54.000 --> 2:05:55.760]  I want them as a memento.
[2:05:55.760 --> 2:05:56.600]  So they were laughing.
[2:05:56.600 --> 2:05:58.560]  I said, well, I can't laugh on this mug shot.
[2:05:58.560 --> 2:06:00.680]  I said, I need like an Al Capone look.
[2:06:00.680 --> 2:06:02.560]  So I kind of just stayed in.
[2:06:02.560 --> 2:06:06.040]  And that mug shot went around the world within 15 minutes.
[2:06:06.040 --> 2:06:07.160]  I mean, it was around,
[2:06:07.160 --> 2:06:09.840]  people were messaging my wife from India and Africa
[2:06:09.840 --> 2:06:12.440]  and whatever, but I felt the law say,
[2:06:12.440 --> 2:06:13.760]  don't attack the sheriff.
[2:06:13.760 --> 2:06:15.760]  I actually am friends with the sheriff
[2:06:15.760 --> 2:06:16.760]  and was friends with him.
[2:06:16.760 --> 2:06:18.600]  He was texting me on the phone.
[2:06:18.600 --> 2:06:22.040]  And I became an honorary deputy sheriff
[2:06:22.040 --> 2:06:23.320]  two weeks before my arrest.
[2:06:23.320 --> 2:06:26.400]  He actually told me on the phone, you safe, you okay?
[2:06:26.400 --> 2:06:27.840]  But the city put pressure on him
[2:06:27.840 --> 2:06:30.360]  and they were at the church that turned me in.
[2:06:30.360 --> 2:06:31.720]  I found like seven churches,
[2:06:31.720 --> 2:06:33.040]  which I hold nothing against them.
[2:06:33.040 --> 2:06:35.840]  But so when I left, I was in about,
[2:06:35.840 --> 2:06:38.040]  they took me Alex, I did my fingerprints, whatever.
[2:06:38.040 --> 2:06:39.000]  They put me in the cell.
[2:06:39.000 --> 2:06:40.080]  I actually fell asleep.
[2:06:40.080 --> 2:06:42.280]  Believe it or not, people, I was so tired, you know,
[2:06:42.280 --> 2:06:45.360]  cause I was on the phone dealing with passers
[2:06:45.360 --> 2:06:47.600]  around the world and people thought
[2:06:47.600 --> 2:06:48.640]  it was the end of the planet.
[2:06:48.640 --> 2:06:51.600]  I said, no, it's not the end, but this is a test run
[2:06:51.600 --> 2:06:54.320]  and they want to try it, but we have to push back.
[2:06:54.320 --> 2:06:56.080]  We have to stand up and boldly preach the gospel.
[2:06:56.080 --> 2:06:58.160]  And by the way, Paschal, you say it's a communist takeover.
[2:06:58.160 --> 2:07:01.600]  Black Lives Matter, Antifa openly say they're communist.
[2:07:01.600 --> 2:07:05.160]  The whole system is a communist Chinese operation.
[2:07:05.160 --> 2:07:07.080]  All of this is an admitted plan
[2:07:07.080 --> 2:07:09.040]  with the mega banks above it.
[2:07:09.040 --> 2:07:10.480]  They admit this.
[2:07:10.480 --> 2:07:13.560]  How do you see their takeover plan going right now?
[2:07:13.560 --> 2:07:14.960]  Well, I think it's failing.
[2:07:14.960 --> 2:07:15.800]  I think it's failing.
[2:07:15.800 --> 2:07:18.720]  First of all, I mean, look at, look at California.
[2:07:18.720 --> 2:07:20.000]  No fireworks.
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:22.480]  Los Angeles probably had one of the greatest fireworks
[2:07:22.480 --> 2:07:23.600]  to play of all.
[2:07:23.600 --> 2:07:25.280]  And, and, but let me just say this.
[2:07:25.280 --> 2:07:26.720]  I felt that the Lord said,
[2:07:26.720 --> 2:07:29.240]  don't attack the sheriff cause he's going to call you.
[2:07:29.240 --> 2:07:30.600]  And that's exactly what happened.
[2:07:30.600 --> 2:07:33.120]  I went live and I started broadcasting every night.
[2:07:33.120 --> 2:07:35.200]  We shut the church down because we had over a hundred
[2:07:35.200 --> 2:07:38.640]  thousand threats, their threats, Facebook, Instagram,
[2:07:38.640 --> 2:07:40.600]  Twitter, phone calls and the ministry.
[2:07:40.600 --> 2:07:41.440]  But I went on.
[2:07:41.440 --> 2:07:42.640]  Churches are being burned everywhere.
[2:07:42.640 --> 2:07:43.960]  Yeah.
[2:07:43.960 --> 2:07:48.080]  Sure. Every night we had between a hundred thousand views
[2:07:48.080 --> 2:07:48.920]  just online.
[2:07:48.920 --> 2:07:50.160]  I was on television.
[2:07:50.160 --> 2:07:53.480]  And so millions of people around the world were tuning in
[2:07:53.480 --> 2:07:56.760]  and I just stayed online until I knew that we could open up.
[2:07:56.760 --> 2:07:58.640]  And not that we couldn't have,
[2:07:58.640 --> 2:08:00.760]  because within three days of my wrist,
[2:08:00.760 --> 2:08:02.280]  the dominoes started falling.
[2:08:02.280 --> 2:08:03.880]  The church was declared essential service.
[2:08:03.880 --> 2:08:05.280]  So I noticed when you got arrested,
[2:08:05.280 --> 2:08:08.640]  that's what finally got Trump to trigger and to take action.
[2:08:08.640 --> 2:08:10.760]  So again, the devil calls us a victory.
[2:08:10.760 --> 2:08:13.320]  This is a huge victory for Christ.
[2:08:13.320 --> 2:08:15.720]  Yes. But let me tell you what we're doing now.
[2:08:15.720 --> 2:08:18.800]  I felt the Lord say take this field and make a stand.
[2:08:18.800 --> 2:08:21.440]  So we have two acres of parking lot
[2:08:21.440 --> 2:08:23.080]  that I turned into a giant field.
[2:08:23.080 --> 2:08:24.600]  I know they send pictures to you.
[2:08:24.600 --> 2:08:25.440]  I don't know if you-
[2:08:25.440 --> 2:08:26.280]  We've been putting on screen.
[2:08:26.280 --> 2:08:27.320]  Yes, we'll show it.
[2:08:27.320 --> 2:08:29.720]  Okay. Alex, listen, unbelievable.
[2:08:29.720 --> 2:08:32.800]  We've had over 9,000 people come on the property
[2:08:32.800 --> 2:08:34.680]  and we brought costing to millions of homes
[2:08:34.680 --> 2:08:38.920]  across Africa every night, across the UK, across America.
[2:08:38.920 --> 2:08:41.120]  I'm telling all the churches to stand up,
[2:08:41.120 --> 2:08:42.400]  to make a difference.
[2:08:42.400 --> 2:08:45.240]  And the churches should never close the doors.
[2:08:45.240 --> 2:08:47.440]  And I told everybody, we will never close our doors.
[2:08:47.440 --> 2:08:50.000]  Now, the sheriffs, yeah, I've got bomb-sniffing dogs.
[2:08:50.000 --> 2:08:51.760]  I mean, they're actually protecting me now.
[2:08:51.760 --> 2:08:53.080]  Not that there is any threat.
[2:08:53.080 --> 2:08:54.600]  I mean, we'll take care of ourselves.
[2:08:54.600 --> 2:08:58.160]  But I'm just telling you, this is an attack on the gospel
[2:08:58.160 --> 2:08:59.960]  which people don't, they say, no, it's not.
[2:08:59.960 --> 2:09:00.800]  It's about a virus.
[2:09:00.800 --> 2:09:01.720]  It's not.
[2:09:01.720 --> 2:09:04.560]  There's only 510,000 people dead in the world
[2:09:04.560 --> 2:09:07.920]  or 520,000 out of 7.8 billion.
[2:09:07.920 --> 2:09:09.840]  This is a plan to shut the globe down
[2:09:09.840 --> 2:09:10.880]  and shut the church down.
[2:09:10.880 --> 2:09:12.240]  That's right. Punish. Punish.
[2:09:12.240 --> 2:09:13.840]  People for trying to take their country back.
[2:09:13.840 --> 2:09:14.680]  Stay there.
[2:09:14.680 --> 2:09:18.520]  Let's talk about the reality and the book, The Phantom Virus,
[2:09:18.520 --> 2:09:20.840]  and how you lay it out and how Amazon banned it
[2:09:20.840 --> 2:09:24.360]  with Pastor Rodney Howard Brown Revival.com.
[2:09:24.360 --> 2:09:25.880]  Alan Shones with infowars.com.
[2:09:25.880 --> 2:09:26.720]  Stay with us.
[2:09:28.960 --> 2:09:32.600]  Ultra 12 is already our overall number one bestseller.
[2:09:32.600 --> 2:09:36.600]  Ultra 12 is twice as strong as Secret 12
[2:09:36.600 --> 2:09:38.560]  for an even lower price.
[2:09:38.560 --> 2:09:41.440]  Because I signed a huge multi-year contract
[2:09:41.440 --> 2:09:43.120]  to guarantee to buy a ton of it.
[2:09:43.120 --> 2:09:46.520]  And my bet ended up to be successful so far.
[2:09:46.520 --> 2:09:48.680]  Folks are ordering it in mass.
[2:09:48.680 --> 2:09:50.240]  They're getting great responses.
[2:09:50.240 --> 2:09:51.960]  They're giving us incredible reviews
[2:09:51.960 --> 2:09:55.320]  because we know what vitamin B12 of this type does
[2:09:55.320 --> 2:09:57.480]  taken under the tongue where it's more absorbable.
[2:09:57.480 --> 2:09:59.520]  It supports healthy nerve and brain cells,
[2:09:59.520 --> 2:10:03.680]  helps make DNA, help the body produce more energy,
[2:10:03.680 --> 2:10:05.160]  help produce healthy blood cells,
[2:10:05.160 --> 2:10:07.480]  essential for proper nervous system function,
[2:10:07.480 --> 2:10:08.680]  and so much more.
[2:10:08.680 --> 2:10:10.120]  You can take all the energy drinks
[2:10:10.120 --> 2:10:11.160]  and they won't do anything
[2:10:11.160 --> 2:10:13.840]  if you don't have the basics already in your body
[2:10:13.840 --> 2:10:16.000]  like vitamin B12.
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:17.560]  Whether you're old, whether you're young,
[2:10:17.560 --> 2:10:19.160]  whether you're black, whether you're white,
[2:10:19.160 --> 2:10:21.200]  whether you live in Japan or the United States,

[2:12:01.640 --> 2:12:02.640]  very, very carefully.
[2:12:02.640 --> 2:12:05.640]  Pastor Brian is not here giving you his opinion.
[2:12:05.640 --> 2:12:07.640]  This is now out of the open.
[2:12:07.640 --> 2:12:09.640]  He's a great researcher and author.
[2:12:09.640 --> 2:12:12.640]  This is a communist takeover.
[2:12:12.640 --> 2:12:15.640]  And he has witnessed what communism has done in Africa
[2:12:15.640 --> 2:12:16.640]  and around the world.
[2:12:16.640 --> 2:12:19.640]  And this is megabanks, the mega-rich funding communism
[2:12:19.640 --> 2:12:22.640]  to destroy the free market, to consolidate things,
[2:12:22.640 --> 2:12:24.640]  to shut down the small businesses,
[2:12:24.640 --> 2:12:26.640]  and only have the big businesses in control.
[2:12:26.640 --> 2:12:29.640]  The pastor, I want to get into your new book,
[2:12:29.640 --> 2:12:30.640]  The Phantom Virus.
[2:12:30.640 --> 2:12:32.640]  I want to talk about what you've witnessed.
[2:12:32.640 --> 2:12:35.640]  But let's play a few clips here.
[2:12:35.640 --> 2:12:39.640]  Here's a little 30-second promo of the new book
[2:12:39.640 --> 2:12:42.640]  that's now available, Phantom Virus.
[2:12:42.640 --> 2:12:43.640]  Here it is.
[2:12:49.640 --> 2:12:51.640]  The World Health Organization is part
[2:12:51.640 --> 2:12:53.640]  of the United Nations system.
[2:12:53.640 --> 2:12:57.640]  Dr. Fauci, Dr. Anthony Fauci.
[2:12:57.640 --> 2:13:00.640]  We know we need broad-scale testing
[2:13:00.640 --> 2:13:03.640]  and the ability for contact tracing.
[2:13:03.640 --> 2:13:07.640]  If anything kills over 10 million people,
[2:13:07.640 --> 2:13:11.640]  it's most likely to be a highly infectious virus.
[2:13:14.640 --> 2:13:16.640]  Now, I'll play a clip here of Pastor Prang
[2:13:16.640 --> 2:13:17.640]  talking about this.
[2:13:17.640 --> 2:13:19.640]  This is what they're trying to censor and shut down.
[2:13:19.640 --> 2:13:22.640]  Why are they so scared of real, God-faring churches
[2:13:22.640 --> 2:13:24.640]  that were Antifa and Black Lives Matters
[2:13:24.640 --> 2:13:26.640]  being deployed by Democrats who say
[2:13:26.640 --> 2:13:28.640]  they have a right to protest
[2:13:28.640 --> 2:13:30.640]  and then go shut your church down?
[2:13:30.640 --> 2:13:32.640]  This isn't just discriminate.
[2:13:32.640 --> 2:13:34.640]  Now it's sinned people to shut down your speech
[2:13:34.640 --> 2:13:36.640]  with the group they say has speech.
[2:13:36.640 --> 2:14:03.640]  Here's Pastor Brown's prayer.
[2:14:07.640 --> 2:14:10.640]  Thank you for sending your blood for me.
[2:14:10.640 --> 2:14:14.640]  Thank you again on the third day you rose from me.
[2:14:14.640 --> 2:14:18.640]  And thank you that you're coming back again for me.
[2:14:18.640 --> 2:14:24.640]  From this now on, I'll never be the same again.
[2:14:24.640 --> 2:14:30.640]  I confess, Jesus Christ has come to French.
[2:14:30.640 --> 2:14:34.640]  He is my Lord and my Savior.
[2:14:34.640 --> 2:14:40.640]  And right now, by faith in the finished work at the cross
[2:14:40.640 --> 2:14:45.640]  and by the shared blood of Jesus, I am saved.
[2:14:45.640 --> 2:14:49.640]  Thank you, Lord, for saving me now.
[2:14:49.640 --> 2:14:51.640]  Now, let those hands and just thank Him.
[2:14:51.640 --> 2:14:55.640]  I now pray over these that are standing right now
[2:14:55.640 --> 2:14:59.640]  that you would seal them now by your blood and by your spirit
[2:14:59.640 --> 2:15:01.640]  that on that day no one would be missing,
[2:15:01.640 --> 2:15:04.640]  raise them up to be mighty men and women of God.
[2:15:04.640 --> 2:15:07.640]  Use them to impact this generation.
[2:15:07.640 --> 2:15:09.640]  Set them ablaze.
[2:15:09.640 --> 2:15:11.640]  Set them on fire.
[2:15:11.640 --> 2:15:14.640]  Even now, put a holy boldness upon their life
[2:15:14.640 --> 2:15:18.640]  and use them to bring many souls into the kingdom
[2:15:18.640 --> 2:15:20.640]  that on that day they will hear these words.
[2:15:20.640 --> 2:15:23.640]  Well done now, good and faithful servant.
[2:15:23.640 --> 2:15:25.640]  End it out in the joy of the Lord.
[2:15:25.640 --> 2:15:28.640]  Let not one, let not one be missing.
[2:15:28.640 --> 2:15:31.640]  We take them now, we put them in the mighty hands
[2:15:31.640 --> 2:15:32.640]  of the Holy Spirit.
[2:15:32.640 --> 2:15:36.640]  Holy Spirit, you carried me as a boy from Africa
[2:15:36.640 --> 2:15:39.640]  and you took me to 85 countries in the world
[2:15:39.640 --> 2:15:40.640]  over 40 years.
[2:15:40.640 --> 2:15:42.640]  Carry them now too.
[2:15:42.640 --> 2:15:44.640]  I pray this even now.
[2:15:44.640 --> 2:15:45.640]  I break every bondage.
[2:15:45.640 --> 2:15:47.640]  I break every addiction.
[2:15:47.640 --> 2:15:49.640]  I break every curse.
[2:15:49.640 --> 2:15:52.640]  I send it back to its place of origin.
[2:15:52.640 --> 2:15:55.640]  In the name of Jesus, I set you free
[2:15:55.640 --> 2:16:00.640]  for the power of the blood of Jesus.
[2:16:00.640 --> 2:16:03.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, we do this
[2:16:03.640 --> 2:16:04.640]  not because it's real.
[2:16:04.640 --> 2:16:06.640]  We do it for that reason most importantly,
[2:16:06.640 --> 2:16:08.640]  but the enemy hates this.
[2:16:08.640 --> 2:16:12.640]  They are literally in Europe and in the United States
[2:16:12.640 --> 2:16:15.640]  and Australia and in Canada over the top
[2:16:15.640 --> 2:16:17.640]  wanting to shut down churches.
[2:16:17.640 --> 2:16:20.640]  And it's so obsessed with it and just,
[2:16:20.640 --> 2:16:23.640]  and sending thugs to attack Christian churches.
[2:16:23.640 --> 2:16:25.640]  Why are they so scared, Pastor?
[2:16:25.640 --> 2:16:28.640]  Because I see that diverse crowd
[2:16:28.640 --> 2:16:30.640]  in true unity in Christ.
[2:16:30.640 --> 2:16:32.640]  That's what the new Lord fears.
[2:16:32.640 --> 2:16:35.640]  They're afraid because this unity is strength
[2:16:35.640 --> 2:16:38.640]  and plus when we give our life to the Lord,
[2:16:38.640 --> 2:16:39.640]  you don't care.
[2:16:39.640 --> 2:16:41.640]  You're not worried about you're going to die
[2:16:41.640 --> 2:16:43.640]  because you know where you're going.
[2:16:43.640 --> 2:16:44.640]  You know what we did?
[2:16:44.640 --> 2:16:46.640]  Alex, we did a manifesto.
[2:16:46.640 --> 2:16:49.640]  It's on the website called thestand20.com
[2:16:49.640 --> 2:16:51.640]  which is for this event.
[2:16:51.640 --> 2:16:55.640]  I make everybody sign a waiver to get on the field.
[2:16:55.640 --> 2:16:57.640]  That means they will not hold us responsible
[2:16:57.640 --> 2:16:59.640]  for contracting COVID-19
[2:16:59.640 --> 2:17:01.640]  because they could have got into the gas station
[2:17:01.640 --> 2:17:03.640]  or Walmart or the Uber guy or Uber Eats.
[2:17:03.640 --> 2:17:05.640]  So they're not going to hold us responsible.
[2:17:05.640 --> 2:17:07.640]  And some people don't want to sign it.
[2:17:07.640 --> 2:17:08.640]  We say you can't come.
[2:17:08.640 --> 2:17:11.640]  But this is what the manifesto says.
[2:17:11.640 --> 2:17:14.640]  The anti-crime system operating through the who
[2:17:14.640 --> 2:17:17.640]  and the UN and governments will not have
[2:17:17.640 --> 2:17:20.640]  mocked the church and the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[2:17:20.640 --> 2:17:23.640]  They've done this by arbitrarily shutting down the church
[2:17:23.640 --> 2:17:25.640]  by not acknowledging or recognizing
[2:17:25.640 --> 2:17:27.640]  the church as an essential service
[2:17:27.640 --> 2:17:29.640]  but openly discriminating against
[2:17:29.640 --> 2:17:31.640]  and even persecuting the church.
[2:17:31.640 --> 2:17:33.640]  In the arrogance and gobleness,
[2:17:33.640 --> 2:17:35.640]  they've attempted to neutralize the word
[2:17:35.640 --> 2:17:38.640]  and the power of God to mute the voice of the church,
[2:17:38.640 --> 2:17:40.640]  the voice of righteousness and truth.
[2:17:40.640 --> 2:17:43.640]  They ignore or belittle the teachings of Jesus Christ.
[2:17:43.640 --> 2:17:45.640]  They mock the word of Almighty God,
[2:17:45.640 --> 2:17:47.640]  the blood of Jesus, the power of the Holy Spirit,
[2:17:47.640 --> 2:17:50.640]  the power of our worship, Psalm 91,
[2:17:50.640 --> 2:17:53.640]  the saving and keeping and preserving power of God,
[2:17:53.640 --> 2:17:56.640]  the power of communion, the power of the table of the Lord,
[2:17:56.640 --> 2:17:58.640]  the body and the blood of Jesus,
[2:17:58.640 --> 2:18:00.640]  the doctrine of laying on our hands
[2:18:00.640 --> 2:18:02.640]  and the commandment together together,
[2:18:02.640 --> 2:18:05.640]  the power of unity and prayer and the prayer of agreement.
[2:18:05.640 --> 2:18:09.640]  So with the staff 20, like Elijah,
[2:18:09.640 --> 2:18:11.640]  we mock the prophets of God.
[2:18:11.640 --> 2:18:13.640]  We mock the mainstream media.
[2:18:13.640 --> 2:18:16.640]  We mock those who oppose and resist Almighty God.
[2:18:16.640 --> 2:18:19.640]  They will fail and fall, every one of them.
[2:18:19.640 --> 2:18:22.640]  We stand for the word of God and for billions around the world
[2:18:22.640 --> 2:18:25.640]  whose rights to worship freely were removed
[2:18:25.640 --> 2:18:28.640]  and have not been or perhaps will never be restored.
[2:18:28.640 --> 2:18:31.640]  We stand for hundreds of millions who are dying of starvation
[2:18:31.640 --> 2:18:34.640]  because of this ill-advised, unwarranted lockdown.
[2:18:34.640 --> 2:18:37.640]  There is a virus as there has been in the past.
[2:18:37.640 --> 2:18:41.640]  However, there's no justification for the draconian steps
[2:18:41.640 --> 2:18:43.640]  taken by governments to keep us safe,
[2:18:43.640 --> 2:18:46.640]  which, as it turns out, were concrete
[2:18:46.640 --> 2:18:49.640]  to the advice of scientists and epidemiologists,
[2:18:49.640 --> 2:18:52.640]  experts in pandemics and immunology.
[2:18:52.640 --> 2:18:54.640]  The percentage of deaths have been low
[2:18:54.640 --> 2:18:56.640]  compared to the recovery rate
[2:18:56.640 --> 2:18:58.640]  and even low compared to the number of people who are
[2:18:58.640 --> 2:19:01.640]  and will be adversely affected for years to come
[2:19:01.640 --> 2:19:03.640]  as a direct result of loss of jobs,
[2:19:03.640 --> 2:19:06.640]  businesses and the destruction of their economies
[2:19:06.640 --> 2:19:08.640]  and the loss of personal freedoms.
[2:19:08.640 --> 2:19:11.640]  Many more people are at risk of dying or have already died
[2:19:11.640 --> 2:19:14.640]  because they have been denied medical care for other ailments.
[2:19:14.640 --> 2:19:17.640]  Us and on this field represents the dreams
[2:19:17.640 --> 2:19:19.640]  of billions of people worldwide.
[2:19:19.640 --> 2:19:22.640]  We stand to see all nations of the Earth open back up
[2:19:22.640 --> 2:19:25.640]  and with no blackmail of the citizenry
[2:19:25.640 --> 2:19:28.640]  through forced participation in tracking apps,
[2:19:28.640 --> 2:19:31.640]  mandatory vaccines or the threat of permanent
[2:19:31.640 --> 2:19:33.640]  loss of their freedoms and rights.
[2:19:33.640 --> 2:19:35.640]  Governments serve people. People are not obligated
[2:19:35.640 --> 2:19:37.640]  to serve governments.
[2:19:37.640 --> 2:19:39.640]  Our rights are given to us by Almighty God.
[2:19:39.640 --> 2:19:41.640]  We are not slaves. We are free people.
[2:19:41.640 --> 2:19:44.640]  We stand to see the restoration of people's liberties
[2:19:44.640 --> 2:19:46.640]  to live and die at our own risk.
[2:19:46.640 --> 2:19:48.640]  We stand and we worship,
[2:19:48.640 --> 2:19:50.640]  according to Psalm 150,
[2:19:50.640 --> 2:19:53.640]  with voices and singing and musical instruments.
[2:19:53.640 --> 2:19:55.640]  We lay hands upon people.
[2:19:55.640 --> 2:19:57.640]  We have great protection.
[2:19:57.640 --> 2:19:59.640]  We stand for the gospel
[2:19:59.640 --> 2:20:01.640]  and stand with us.
[2:20:01.640 --> 2:20:04.640]  May this field, this stand be duplicated
[2:20:04.640 --> 2:20:06.640]  through God's people in all 50 states
[2:20:06.640 --> 2:20:08.640]  in every US territory and every county in the world.
[2:20:08.640 --> 2:20:10.640]  We stand 20.
[2:20:10.640 --> 2:20:12.640]  Now we've got people replicating it.
[2:20:12.640 --> 2:20:14.640]  They're doing this all over the world.
[2:20:14.640 --> 2:20:16.640]  Can I talk to you the other day? This is the biggest thing ever.
[2:20:16.640 --> 2:20:18.640]  I should have started the whole show with this.
[2:20:18.640 --> 2:20:20.640]  Let's talk about re-energizing Christian soldiers
[2:20:20.640 --> 2:20:22.640]  worldwide to take back the planet from Satan
[2:20:22.640 --> 2:20:24.640]  on the other side with Pastor Rodney Howard Brown
[2:20:24.640 --> 2:20:26.640]  and Alan Jones.
[2:20:34.640 --> 2:20:36.640]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[2:20:36.640 --> 2:20:38.640]  Where did it come from?
[2:20:38.640 --> 2:20:40.640]  Where did it come from?
[2:20:40.640 --> 2:20:42.640]  Where did it come from?
[2:20:42.640 --> 2:20:44.640]  Where did it come from?
[2:20:44.640 --> 2:20:46.640]  infowarstore.com
[2:20:46.640 --> 2:20:48.640]  We can't survive without pure, clean drinking water.
[2:20:48.640 --> 2:20:50.640]  So make sure that it's always available to you
[2:20:50.640 --> 2:20:52.640]  with the Alexa Pure Water Filtration System.

[2:20:56.640 --> 2:20:58.640]  and gets straight to clean, healthy,
[2:20:58.640 --> 2:21:00.640]  great-tasting water.
[2:21:00.640 --> 2:21:02.640]  Mmm.
[2:21:02.640 --> 2:21:04.640]  Mmm.
[2:21:04.640 --> 2:21:06.640]  Mmm.
[2:21:06.640 --> 2:21:08.640]  Yummy in my tummy.

[2:21:10.640 --> 2:21:12.640]  to your home
[2:21:12.640 --> 2:21:14.640]  by ordering the Alexa Pure Water Filtration System
[2:21:14.640 --> 2:21:16.640]  today
[2:21:16.640 --> 2:21:18.640]  from infowarstore.com
[2:21:18.640 --> 2:21:20.640]  infowarstore.com
[2:21:20.640 --> 2:21:22.640]  Other systems
[2:21:22.640 --> 2:21:36.640]  just don't compare.
[2:21:52.640 --> 2:21:54.640]  It's another base
[2:21:54.640 --> 2:21:56.640]  as having a case that is counted
[2:21:56.640 --> 2:21:58.640]  as a case of COVID-19.
[2:21:58.640 --> 2:22:00.640]  It's in the NIH documents.
[2:22:00.640 --> 2:22:02.640]  It's at the state level.
[2:22:02.640 --> 2:22:04.640]  We confirmed it in Texas.
[2:22:04.640 --> 2:22:06.640]  We're now confirming it's in other states.
[2:22:06.640 --> 2:22:08.640]  This is beyond the other smoking guns
[2:22:08.640 --> 2:22:10.640]  of them putting people that died on shot wounds
[2:22:10.640 --> 2:22:12.640]  and stuff in the COVID column
[2:22:12.640 --> 2:22:14.640]  and the false positive tests.
[2:22:14.640 --> 2:22:16.640]  That's all huge.
[2:22:16.640 --> 2:22:18.640]  This is beyond that mega-criminal activity.
[2:22:18.640 --> 2:22:20.640]  And we've got these different county commission videos
[2:22:20.640 --> 2:22:22.640]  and the world is this.
[2:22:22.640 --> 2:22:24.640]  The full video is posted at Band-On Video.
[2:22:24.640 --> 2:22:26.640]  Get it out and expose the hoax.
[2:22:26.640 --> 2:22:28.640]  When I thank the listeners of this broadcast,
[2:22:28.640 --> 2:22:30.640]  I'm not patting you on the head.
[2:22:30.640 --> 2:22:32.640]  I'm like a person that's been thrown overboard
[2:22:32.640 --> 2:22:34.640]  who finds
[2:22:34.640 --> 2:22:36.640]  a life raft to get on or a piece of driftwood.
[2:22:36.640 --> 2:22:38.640]  I am clinging to you.
[2:22:38.640 --> 2:22:40.640]  So when you call the show and thank me,
[2:22:40.640 --> 2:22:42.640]  listen, I'm thanking you too.
[2:22:42.640 --> 2:22:44.640]  We are in this together.
[2:22:44.640 --> 2:22:46.640]  Now, I try to bring you things that I know are amazing
[2:22:46.640 --> 2:22:48.640]  that have helped me and my family.
[2:22:48.640 --> 2:22:50.640]  Again, I treat you like I want to be treated.
[2:22:50.640 --> 2:22:52.640]  It's not a science. It's not a plan.
[2:22:52.640 --> 2:22:54.640]  It's just the way to do it.
[2:22:54.640 --> 2:22:56.640]  It's just common sense.
[2:22:56.640 --> 2:22:58.640]  And if you get one product, it's bodies.
[2:22:58.640 --> 2:23:00.640]  Now, our big Fourth of July Supercell
[2:23:00.640 --> 2:23:02.640]  is going right now through Fourth of July
[2:23:02.640 --> 2:23:04.640]  and bodies have been sold out for over three months.
[2:23:04.640 --> 2:23:06.640]  It's now back in stock.
[2:23:06.640 --> 2:23:08.640]  It is the strongest turmeric concentrate
[2:23:08.640 --> 2:23:10.640]  we can find out there.
[2:23:10.640 --> 2:23:12.640]  It may be the strongest on the market.
[2:23:12.640 --> 2:23:14.640]  Somebody might have one stronger. We don't know about it or we dab it.
[2:23:14.640 --> 2:23:16.640]  It is back in stock at 50% off.
[2:23:16.640 --> 2:23:18.640]  I encourage you all to get bodies,
[2:23:18.640 --> 2:23:20.640]  ultimate turmeric formula while you still can,
[2:23:20.640 --> 2:23:22.640]  50% off for the Fourth of July,
[2:23:22.640 --> 2:23:24.640]  and find the M4 at M4store.com.
[2:23:24.640 --> 2:23:26.640]  My salute and thank you all.
[2:23:26.640 --> 2:23:52.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:23:56.640 --> 2:23:58.640]  This is an A.I. takeover.
[2:24:11.640 --> 2:24:13.640]  But he rose again.
[2:24:17.640 --> 2:24:19.640]  Rose again.
[2:24:20.640 --> 2:24:22.640]  Wise men follow him.
[2:24:22.640 --> 2:24:24.640]  All right, Pastor,
[2:24:24.640 --> 2:24:26.640]  I want to talk about what they're trying to suppress
[2:24:26.640 --> 2:24:28.640]  Amazon Block in your book.
[2:24:28.640 --> 2:24:30.640]  How we just got used to this.
[2:24:30.640 --> 2:24:32.640]  Oh, now Amazon Block's books,
[2:24:32.640 --> 2:24:34.640]  because you're challenging their narrative,
[2:24:34.640 --> 2:24:36.640]  which they said 25 million dead,
[2:24:36.640 --> 2:24:38.640]  worldwide by now.
[2:24:38.640 --> 2:24:40.640]  Like you said, half a million, most of it fake numbers.
[2:24:40.640 --> 2:24:42.640]  A real virus major exaggerated.
[2:24:42.640 --> 2:24:44.640]  2.5 million dead, 2.2 million dead here.
[2:24:44.640 --> 2:24:46.640]  130,000, most of that exaggerated.
[2:24:48.640 --> 2:24:50.640]  How can we not
[2:24:50.640 --> 2:24:52.640]  have the right, all these medical doctors
[2:24:52.640 --> 2:24:54.640]  getting blocked on YouTube,
[2:24:54.640 --> 2:24:56.640]  blocked on Twitter, Facebook for owning
[2:24:56.640 --> 2:24:58.640]  hospitals and saying, hey, our wards are empty.
[2:24:58.640 --> 2:25:00.640]  We treat people with zinc,
[2:25:00.640 --> 2:25:02.640]  hydroxychloroquine.
[2:25:02.640 --> 2:25:04.640]  I mean, this is so evil.
[2:25:04.640 --> 2:25:06.640]  It's just suddenly we wake up and we're inside the matrix.
[2:25:08.640 --> 2:25:10.640]  Look, everybody has to stand up.
[2:25:10.640 --> 2:25:12.640]  There's no question.
[2:25:12.640 --> 2:25:14.640]  And that's what I'm trying to do with the stand to get
[2:25:14.640 --> 2:25:16.640]  pastors and leaders to stand up and make a difference.
[2:25:16.640 --> 2:25:18.640]  Listen, no
[2:25:18.640 --> 2:25:20.640]  town, city council
[2:25:20.640 --> 2:25:22.640]  or mayor or governor
[2:25:22.640 --> 2:25:24.640]  can make an order that
[2:25:24.640 --> 2:25:26.640]  supersedes the constitution.
[2:25:26.640 --> 2:25:28.640]  That's why everything was changed for me within
[2:25:28.640 --> 2:25:30.640]  three days. It was all reverse charges
[2:25:30.640 --> 2:25:32.640]  dropped because I had the
[2:25:32.640 --> 2:25:34.640]  reality of the supreme law, the land, the
[2:25:34.640 --> 2:25:36.640]  constitution, so people don't understand that.
[2:25:36.640 --> 2:25:38.640]  They think, well, I mean, I have some pastors
[2:25:38.640 --> 2:25:40.640]  don't even want to talk to me because I've got
[2:25:40.640 --> 2:25:42.640]  arrested. I have a mugshot, but it actually
[2:25:42.640 --> 2:25:44.640]  ended up with a blessing
[2:25:44.640 --> 2:25:46.640]  being a blessing in disguise.
[2:25:46.640 --> 2:25:48.640]  I've got more friends now than I ever had before.
[2:25:48.640 --> 2:25:50.640]  The bottom line is this.
[2:25:50.640 --> 2:25:52.640]  We have to make a stand.
[2:25:52.640 --> 2:25:54.640]  And here's what I told everybody on the front end of this.
[2:25:54.640 --> 2:25:56.640]  Whatever you give up this side,
[2:25:56.640 --> 2:25:58.640]  you'll never give back on the other side
[2:25:58.640 --> 2:26:00.640]  because they don't just take an inch or six.
[2:26:00.640 --> 2:26:02.640]  They take everything.
[2:26:02.640 --> 2:26:04.640]  They take all your freedoms.
[2:26:04.640 --> 2:26:06.640]  So now pastors in England,
[2:26:06.640 --> 2:26:08.640]  you can speak, but you can't
[2:26:08.640 --> 2:26:10.640]  raise your voice.
[2:26:10.640 --> 2:26:12.640]  And now they can't sing. You can't sing in church.
[2:26:12.640 --> 2:26:14.640]  What? The Bible tells us to sing.
[2:26:14.640 --> 2:26:16.640]  If we don't raise their hearts in the church,
[2:26:16.640 --> 2:26:18.640]  they're literally seeing and will follow
[2:26:18.640 --> 2:26:20.640]  all their ridiculous little rules
[2:26:20.640 --> 2:26:22.640]  and turn us into government cults.
[2:26:22.640 --> 2:26:24.640]  And let's talk about that since she brought it up.
[2:26:24.640 --> 2:26:26.640]  They are... It's never going to happen.
[2:26:26.640 --> 2:26:28.640]  Please continue.
[2:26:28.640 --> 2:26:30.640]  No, it's never going to happen.
[2:26:30.640 --> 2:26:32.640]  I mean, not yet. And not some of the
[2:26:32.640 --> 2:26:34.640]  people I'm talking to, even in Los Angeles.
[2:26:34.640 --> 2:26:36.640]  There's churches being right now.
[2:26:36.640 --> 2:26:38.640]  And this is, there is an uprising
[2:26:38.640 --> 2:26:40.640]  taking place. Listen, 15 days
[2:26:40.640 --> 2:26:42.640]  to slow this spread, people said,
[2:26:42.640 --> 2:26:44.640]  okay, but now what?
[2:26:44.640 --> 2:26:46.640]  Over a hundred days and now there's a re...
[2:26:46.640 --> 2:26:48.640]  Come on. You couldn't sit
[2:26:48.640 --> 2:26:50.640]  and watch Fauci,
[2:26:50.640 --> 2:26:52.640]  who probably shops and gets his clothes
[2:26:52.640 --> 2:26:54.640]  at the JC Penney's
[2:26:54.640 --> 2:26:56.640]  children's section.
[2:26:56.640 --> 2:26:58.640]  Blah, blah, blah.
[2:26:58.640 --> 2:27:00.640]  I actually switched off
[2:27:00.640 --> 2:27:02.640]  listening to anything they were saying.
[2:27:02.640 --> 2:27:04.640]  I couldn't take another thing. Test
[2:27:04.640 --> 2:27:06.640]  and whatever. The test is where
[2:27:06.640 --> 2:27:08.640]  the problem is. Everybody,
[2:27:08.640 --> 2:27:10.640]  COVID-19
[2:27:10.640 --> 2:27:12.640]  actually, it's a flu virus.
[2:27:12.640 --> 2:27:14.640]  And there are 30 different strains plus more.
[2:27:14.640 --> 2:27:16.640]  For this virus to get to do what it's done
[2:27:16.640 --> 2:27:18.640]  in nature would take
[2:27:18.640 --> 2:27:20.640]  800 years. This was a bioweapon.
[2:27:20.640 --> 2:27:22.640]  Started in a laboratory
[2:27:22.640 --> 2:27:24.640]  in the United States, moved to another one.
[2:27:24.640 --> 2:27:26.640]  And then... That's Fauci ran.
[2:27:26.640 --> 2:27:28.640]  He was basically running Luan.
[2:27:28.640 --> 2:27:30.640]  The whole thing.
[2:27:30.640 --> 2:27:32.640]  And that's where they genetically modified
[2:27:32.640 --> 2:27:34.640]  and bring the back. It didn't come from
[2:27:34.640 --> 2:27:36.640]  bat soup. I mean, to all
[2:27:36.640 --> 2:27:38.640]  that have bat soup keep
[2:27:38.640 --> 2:27:40.640]  drinking. I'm teasing, but
[2:27:40.640 --> 2:27:42.640]  you're not going to get COVID-19.
[2:27:42.640 --> 2:27:44.640]  It's a flu virus that has been
[2:27:44.640 --> 2:27:46.640]  engineered.
[2:27:46.640 --> 2:27:48.640]  And they were very clever.
[2:27:48.640 --> 2:27:50.640]  Okay, so I don't know why, you know,
[2:27:50.640 --> 2:27:52.640]  because all this is about population reduction.
[2:27:52.640 --> 2:27:54.640]  But what they want to do is come
[2:27:54.640 --> 2:27:56.640]  with the forced vaccines, the tracking
[2:27:56.640 --> 2:27:58.640]  apps and whatever, and then
[2:27:58.640 --> 2:28:00.640]  control the whole humanity. That is not
[2:28:00.640 --> 2:28:02.640]  going to happen because I already know
[2:28:02.640 --> 2:28:04.640]  it's not even working in England. People
[2:28:04.640 --> 2:28:06.640]  are giving names of their city
[2:28:06.640 --> 2:28:08.640]  officials and their phone numbers.
[2:28:08.640 --> 2:28:10.640]  So...
[2:28:10.640 --> 2:28:12.640]  That's my next question. Talk about that, because I agree with you. This is backfiring.
[2:28:12.640 --> 2:28:14.640]  But I'm worried they're going to
[2:28:14.640 --> 2:28:16.640]  want something else to try to, like, oh, really?
[2:28:16.640 --> 2:28:18.640]  Okay, well, here's a real bioweapon.
[2:28:18.640 --> 2:28:20.640]  I mean, that's the plan. The plan is
[2:28:20.640 --> 2:28:22.640]  the fall to release another one.
[2:28:22.640 --> 2:28:24.640]  And that's the plan. But I'm telling you, we
[2:28:24.640 --> 2:28:26.640]  are praying, and I'm telling you, I'm not
[2:28:26.640 --> 2:28:28.640]  told to everybody. I don't care if they have
[2:28:28.640 --> 2:28:30.640]  six bubonic plays in our town.
[2:28:30.640 --> 2:28:32.640]  By the way, I love how we're all just synced in.
[2:28:32.640 --> 2:28:34.640]  And of course, it'll turn out to be true. The Holy Spirit
[2:28:34.640 --> 2:28:36.640]  is also the evidence we have.
[2:28:36.640 --> 2:28:38.640]  Is that what you're getting is the transmission from research or God?
[2:28:38.640 --> 2:28:40.640]  Because I know they're going to launch something even worse in the fall.
[2:28:40.640 --> 2:28:42.640]  That's what they plan.
[2:28:42.640 --> 2:28:44.640]  Listen, they are so upset.
[2:28:44.640 --> 2:28:46.640]  They want to do anything they can
[2:28:46.640 --> 2:28:48.640]  to stop what is coming.
[2:28:48.640 --> 2:28:50.640]  But let me tell you, here's what's up.
[2:28:50.640 --> 2:28:52.640]  The riots have failed. Let me tell you
[2:28:52.640 --> 2:28:54.640]  why the riots have failed. Because it's the left
[2:28:54.640 --> 2:28:56.640]  fighting the left. It's really what
[2:28:56.640 --> 2:28:58.640]  you're seeing is the Democratic
[2:28:58.640 --> 2:29:00.640]  party consuming themselves.
[2:29:00.640 --> 2:29:02.640]  So...
[2:29:02.640 --> 2:29:04.640]  It's very funny. I mean, there is no opposition
[2:29:04.640 --> 2:29:06.640]  to these riots. It's basically
[2:29:06.640 --> 2:29:08.640]  a bunch of leftists fighting
[2:29:08.640 --> 2:29:10.640]  against themselves. And of course, they're getting
[2:29:10.640 --> 2:29:12.640]  no results, so that's why they're attacking
[2:29:12.640 --> 2:29:14.640]  statues. And, you know,
[2:29:14.640 --> 2:29:16.640]  I hear that they attack
[2:29:16.640 --> 2:29:18.640]  the statue of Rocky Balboa, and he won
[2:29:18.640 --> 2:29:20.640]  15 rounds. I'm kidding.
[2:29:20.640 --> 2:29:22.640]  The bottom line is this.
[2:29:22.640 --> 2:29:24.640]  You know, so that whole thing is failing.
[2:29:24.640 --> 2:29:26.640]  Because the more they riot and loot,
[2:29:26.640 --> 2:29:28.640]  more Trump's numbers go up.
[2:29:28.640 --> 2:29:30.640]  So now they have to kind of squash that,
[2:29:30.640 --> 2:29:32.640]  but they don't know what to do with that.
[2:29:32.640 --> 2:29:34.640]  So then they want to bring the virus back.
[2:29:34.640 --> 2:29:36.640]  But people are done with that. You know,
[2:29:36.640 --> 2:29:38.640]  Kong go to the beach. People are going,
[2:29:38.640 --> 2:29:40.640]  I'm going to the beach. This is the middle
[2:29:40.640 --> 2:29:42.640]  of summer here in America.
[2:29:42.640 --> 2:29:44.640]  So I was very excited when I saw all the
[2:29:44.640 --> 2:29:46.640]  fireworks being lived across the California
[2:29:46.640 --> 2:29:48.640]  and the Californians are saying absolutely
[2:29:48.640 --> 2:29:50.640]  no. And I mean...
[2:29:50.640 --> 2:29:52.640]  By the way, in Austin, everywhere, I'm not
[2:29:52.640 --> 2:29:54.640]  exaggerating. Ten times what I ever saw.
[2:29:54.640 --> 2:29:56.640]  It went on like World War III.
[2:29:56.640 --> 2:29:58.640]  At my parents' house, they told me, and where
[2:29:58.640 --> 2:30:00.640]  are you? Because people saw this as a way
[2:30:00.640 --> 2:30:02.640]  to say we are not accepting your lockdown.
[2:30:02.640 --> 2:30:04.640]  I mean, look at L.A. that they said they never
[2:30:04.640 --> 2:30:06.640]  said anything like it.
[2:30:06.640 --> 2:30:08.640]  I think people have, you know,
[2:30:08.640 --> 2:30:10.640]  even the left, even some of the,
[2:30:10.640 --> 2:30:12.640]  you know, the liberals have,
[2:30:12.640 --> 2:30:14.640]  you know, okay.
[2:30:14.640 --> 2:30:16.640]  But they are done now. I mean, the highest
[2:30:16.640 --> 2:30:18.640]  number of gun sales.
[2:30:18.640 --> 2:30:20.640]  So they're going to try something,
[2:30:20.640 --> 2:30:22.640]  but I'll tell you, they're going to fail.
[2:30:22.640 --> 2:30:24.640]  Alex, they're going to fail. What they're
[2:30:24.640 --> 2:30:26.640]  underestimating is another spiritual
[2:30:26.640 --> 2:30:28.640]  thing. I think all the hunger of the people,
[2:30:28.640 --> 2:30:30.640]  people starting to get desperate.
[2:30:30.640 --> 2:30:32.640]  I agree with you. I'm seeing massive
[2:30:32.640 --> 2:30:34.640]  awakening of people coming to Christ. Are you
[2:30:34.640 --> 2:30:36.640]  seeing that?
[2:30:36.640 --> 2:30:38.640]  Totally. Totally. And they
[2:30:38.640 --> 2:30:40.640]  don't understand why their churches
[2:30:40.640 --> 2:30:42.640]  shut down. And it's crazy that
[2:30:42.640 --> 2:30:44.640]  and I understand... Exactly.
[2:30:44.640 --> 2:30:46.640]  Now the left tries to take it away,
[2:30:46.640 --> 2:30:48.640]  they understand that's why they need it.
[2:30:48.640 --> 2:30:50.640]  Correct. Totally. Yeah.
[2:30:50.640 --> 2:30:52.640]  Well, you can't go to church. Well, I want
[2:30:52.640 --> 2:30:54.640]  to go to church. And here's the problem
[2:30:54.640 --> 2:30:56.640]  with the people that died in the senior
[2:30:56.640 --> 2:30:58.640]  sister living homes. They died of
[2:30:58.640 --> 2:31:00.640]  aloneliness.
[2:31:00.640 --> 2:31:02.640]  You know, I mean, to rob people, the
[2:31:02.640 --> 2:31:04.640]  ability to see their parents, you know,
[2:31:04.640 --> 2:31:06.640]  say goodbye to their dad that's dying,
[2:31:06.640 --> 2:31:08.640]  that's beyond the pale,
[2:31:08.640 --> 2:31:10.640]  but they can allow, you know,
[2:31:10.640 --> 2:31:12.640]  hey Alex, the virus is so intelligent
[2:31:12.640 --> 2:31:14.640]  that as long as you burn and loot,
[2:31:14.640 --> 2:31:16.640]  the virus leaves.
[2:31:16.640 --> 2:31:18.640]  Now there's official studies, 26 million
[2:31:18.640 --> 2:31:20.640]  March for Black Lives Matter,
[2:31:20.640 --> 2:31:22.640]  that they say did not cause a problem,
[2:31:22.640 --> 2:31:24.640]  but it's true.
[2:31:24.640 --> 2:31:26.640]  It's totally loon...
[2:31:26.640 --> 2:31:28.640]  Let me ask you this. Why are they at war
[2:31:28.640 --> 2:31:30.640]  with logic now?
[2:31:30.640 --> 2:31:32.640]  Because I think they're trying to short
[2:31:32.640 --> 2:31:34.640]  circuit us, just get us used to insanity.
[2:31:34.640 --> 2:31:36.640]  What is that devilish tactic?
[2:31:36.640 --> 2:31:38.640]  It's...
[2:31:38.640 --> 2:31:40.640]  It's like the education system is now
[2:31:40.640 --> 2:31:42.640]  produced. You see what is produced.
[2:31:42.640 --> 2:31:44.640]  I mean, you've got white people attacking
[2:31:44.640 --> 2:31:46.640]  Black people saying, you are racist.
[2:31:46.640 --> 2:31:48.640]  You're a white person telling you
[2:31:48.640 --> 2:31:50.640]  Black person, they are racist.
[2:31:50.640 --> 2:31:55.320]  two we know is not four it's five it's common core education I mean everything
[2:31:55.320 --> 2:32:01.480]  rewriting history getting rid of anything that was America that I mean
[2:32:01.480 --> 2:32:06.280]  there's you can't you can't well I'm so sorry for what my forefathers I have
[2:32:06.280 --> 2:32:11.460]  nothing to do with it but I can make difference now so it's like you're 57
[2:32:11.460 --> 2:32:16.000]  genders there's stealing our editing to say that what somebody in the past is
[2:32:16.000 --> 2:32:20.720]  your fault what about your individualism totally I mean you can see it
[2:32:20.720 --> 2:32:23.880]  happening right across Africa but even in Africa right now you know the
[2:32:23.880 --> 2:32:27.840]  president of Tanzania you know how he kicked the who out and by the way the
[2:32:27.840 --> 2:32:31.920]  headline just came out that Trump we are now officially this happened just
[2:32:31.920 --> 2:32:37.160]  probably hopping out breaking the USA is officially withdrawn from the World
[2:32:37.160 --> 2:32:42.040]  Health Organization that's a good sign but but so you think the president of
[2:32:42.040 --> 2:32:47.680]  Tanzania he tested a goat he tested a papaya which is a fruit and he tested
[2:32:47.680 --> 2:32:54.100]  another I think a banana and they all three came back positive COVID yeah he
[2:32:54.100 --> 2:32:58.120]  kicked the he kicked the who out and there's a hole in Africa right now
[2:32:58.120 --> 2:33:03.460]  they're actually Africans are not buying the COVID thing early no because they
[2:33:03.460 --> 2:33:09.000]  realize we've lived with everything before we use you starving us Alex just
[2:33:09.000 --> 2:33:13.120]  in South Africa alone between probably about 15 million people that are on

[2:37:16.840 --> 2:37:21.560]  funding info wars the most powerful Paul Revere organization in the world it's
[2:37:21.560 --> 2:37:24.680]  powered by you
[2:37:24.680 --> 2:37:36.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:37:41.680 --> 2:37:46.560]  welcome back folks Alex Jones here with pastor Rodney our brown David Beasley is
[2:37:46.560 --> 2:37:51.080]  the head of the UN food program we're saying the UN's bad guys yeah at the top
[2:37:51.080 --> 2:37:55.400]  the food program you know is playing on the service are trying to help people he
[2:37:55.400 --> 2:37:58.640]  said two months ago three million we're already starving to death thirty five
[2:37:58.640 --> 2:38:02.120]  million probably starving death the next year said a hundred and thirty plus
[2:38:02.120 --> 2:38:05.920]  million starving death in the next two years we've played that clip many times
[2:38:05.920 --> 2:38:10.000]  I'm gonna play it again for you here but when the first world collapses the
[2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:14.600]  third world dies you've got contacts all over the third world you travel all of
[2:38:14.600 --> 2:38:19.720]  the world what are you seeing pastor well yes I actually called the state
[2:38:19.720 --> 2:38:23.760]  department I said what we don't understand whatever decision making
[2:38:23.760 --> 2:38:28.600]  first world ramifications in the third world are devastating because how do
[2:38:28.600 --> 2:38:33.960]  you control masses of humanity in the markets they actually make the money by
[2:38:33.960 --> 2:38:38.640]  day trading suddenly now Alex I've got film footage of people being beaten to
[2:38:38.640 --> 2:38:42.520]  death for coming out of their little hut I mean it's horrendous what's been
[2:38:42.520 --> 2:38:48.080]  taking place people are starving I mean there's middle-class families calling
[2:38:48.080 --> 2:38:52.240]  the pastor saying listen we have no food we haven't eaten in seven days you know
[2:38:52.240 --> 2:38:56.480]  you've not even watered the same thing in India people don't realize millions are
[2:38:56.480 --> 2:39:02.720]  dying this is insane yeah and but they called it pastor said listen I'm
[2:39:02.720 --> 2:39:06.000]  probably gonna kill my four daughters and my wife and then myself they have no
[2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:10.160]  food I mean and the pastors are not allowed to take and then the police in
[2:39:10.160 --> 2:39:15.920]  some areas are stealing the food from the pastors and it's like it's like it's a
[2:39:15.920 --> 2:39:19.480]  catch-away to because the church is actually the thing that's been helping
[2:39:19.480 --> 2:39:23.480]  the people all these years and then suddenly the church non-essentials
[2:39:23.480 --> 2:39:27.720]  shut up you can't meet you disconnect it from your people they stuck in their
[2:39:27.720 --> 2:39:31.560]  houses they got no food and then of course everybody thinks they're gonna
[2:39:31.560 --> 2:39:36.440]  die because all they get to watch is the company's news network of CNN and the
[2:39:36.440 --> 2:39:40.320]  BBC and people around the world they don't know anything it's on a tick a
[2:39:40.320 --> 2:39:45.200]  loop and it's just goes and it's just pumping and that's the key about the UN
[2:39:45.200 --> 2:39:48.360]  World Government your new book is about the phantom virus it doesn't matter
[2:39:48.360 --> 2:39:53.640]  whether it's Texas or whether it's Nigeria it's the same global policy run
[2:39:53.640 --> 2:39:58.640]  by the UN so Trump officially removing us from the WHO and the last hour is a
[2:39:58.640 --> 2:40:04.840]  huge victory it's huge because that's funded by the Communist Party so here's
[2:40:04.840 --> 2:40:08.160]  the thing what people don't understand they say come on a combi what you have
[2:40:08.160 --> 2:40:12.800]  to understand the people that run America and run China they are behind the
[2:40:12.800 --> 2:40:17.640]  scenes they don't really care about humanity this is all about control plus
[2:40:17.640 --> 2:40:21.440]  population reduction because what they want to do is they want to come with a
[2:40:21.440 --> 2:40:27.240]  pen vaccine that will not put the full you your social media school like they
[2:40:27.240 --> 2:40:31.440]  do in China already you won't be able to get on a plane without the right
[2:40:31.440 --> 2:40:35.080]  vaccine or a passport that says you've been vaccinated it means again a limit
[2:40:35.080 --> 2:40:39.880]  your travel where you can even go on holiday you can you can see even people
[2:40:39.880 --> 2:40:43.720]  can't walk into restaurants if you're not wearing a mask or whatever of course
[2:40:43.720 --> 2:40:47.240]  in the state of Florida it's illegal for anybody over the age of 16 to wear a
[2:40:47.240 --> 2:40:52.720]  mask and then also when you wear a mask it negates your second amendment you're
[2:40:52.720 --> 2:40:57.680]  not allowed to have a concealed weapon and wear a mask so I tell our church if
[2:40:57.680 --> 2:41:01.520]  they say you're not wearing a mask you just tell them I can't wear a mask
[2:41:01.520 --> 2:41:07.440]  because I have a weapon and and I'm not I'm not gonna be is this not the mark of
[2:41:07.440 --> 2:41:11.840]  the beast you go buying or sell without having this official mark that you're
[2:41:11.840 --> 2:41:16.480]  complying with everything we want you to do yeah it's the antichrist system
[2:41:16.480 --> 2:41:20.680]  obviously the devil's always fine to preempt everything plus then on the
[2:41:20.680 --> 2:41:24.480]  back end of that the vaccines are gonna kill more people than anything which is
[2:41:24.480 --> 2:41:28.840]  all what they want to do with eugenics population reduction but again you know
[2:41:28.840 --> 2:41:32.560]  Alex I'm not a negative person I mean I've written all the books and negative
[2:41:32.560 --> 2:41:36.800]  stuff and whatever but I'm a positive person I believe Jesus said for us to
[2:41:36.800 --> 2:41:41.260]  occupy telly comes we have a job which is the Great Commission to travel the
[2:41:41.260 --> 2:41:44.760]  world and preach the gospel and I'm gonna preach the gospel and if they
[2:41:44.760 --> 2:41:48.440]  they say well you can't what they're gonna arrest me or kill me I don't really
[2:41:48.440 --> 2:41:53.480]  care I personally if they're gonna do it in America I would prefer just do a
[2:41:53.480 --> 2:41:57.600]  guillotine public put it on television because I think that would be great
[2:41:57.600 --> 2:42:01.360]  don't you know don't do it so you're not being much about that isn't there a
[2:42:01.360 --> 2:42:05.280]  real freedom trusting in God and just saying I don't care I'm gonna do the
[2:42:05.280 --> 2:42:09.160]  right thing do whatever you're gonna do I'm done because we know where we're
[2:42:09.160 --> 2:42:14.480]  going Alex we know the world you know we're passing through but I mean as we
[2:42:14.480 --> 2:42:18.360]  have lived and our forefathers and those that went on if you look down through
[2:42:18.360 --> 2:42:22.200]  the years down through the centuries go look at the apostles they gave their
[2:42:22.200 --> 2:42:26.040]  life for the cause of the gospel they were beheaded with right none of them
[2:42:26.040 --> 2:42:29.600]  were submitting to government edicts or to stand on their head or any of this
[2:42:29.600 --> 2:42:34.800]  everyone that wrote Bible was in prison I mean most of them in prison Paul was
[2:42:34.800 --> 2:42:38.760]  in prison you know Jesus they tried to arrest him too and they actually killed
[2:42:38.760 --> 2:42:42.960]  him he hung on a cross for us and that was his mission we understand but the
[2:42:42.960 --> 2:42:47.200]  but we have to make a stand and I you know when you have kids and grandkids
[2:42:47.200 --> 2:42:51.040]  what are you leaving them what they're gonna say let's say that this thing gets
[2:42:51.040 --> 2:42:54.280]  pushed back and we live another hundred years what will they say of this
[2:42:54.280 --> 2:43:00.760]  generation in 2020 there was sleepers 2020 what do you make of Epstein and
[2:43:00.760 --> 2:43:05.760]  Maxwell because there's not just evil trying to goods coming out all this
[2:43:05.760 --> 2:43:08.280]  evil is being exposed right now what would you call this time around right
[2:43:08.280 --> 2:43:14.200]  now you know I mean I've been looking this and you wonder is this just a
[2:43:14.200 --> 2:43:18.160]  decoy to really try to protect what's happening I mean I personally would have
[2:43:18.160 --> 2:43:22.280]  been thought by now Hillary would have been in prison you know and and a lot of
[2:43:22.280 --> 2:43:26.080]  people would have been locked up and if they're still roaming free so I don't
[2:43:26.080 --> 2:43:30.800]  know I don't know what to say I mean I'm watching even the Supreme Court not do
[2:43:30.800 --> 2:43:36.000]  what they supposed to do you know as you know I believe the courts are corrupted
[2:43:36.000 --> 2:43:39.480]  all the way to the from the low courts to the high courts I mean this thing is
[2:43:39.480 --> 2:43:47.640]  pretty far gone but again that's why yes and the truth is coming out I mean but
[2:43:47.640 --> 2:43:51.480]  they are trying to distract they try to say you know you have to apologize for
[2:43:51.480 --> 2:43:56.520]  your whiteness well I mean the bottom line I'm born in Africa but my DNA two
[2:43:56.520 --> 2:44:02.120]  and a half percent I'm East African so I'm actually I do have African blood in
[2:44:02.120 --> 2:44:06.920]  me I I don't know what my ancestors did but I'm two and a half percent African
[2:44:06.920 --> 2:44:11.600]  let's talk about this though 40 you know Christ says render into Caesar that's
[2:44:11.600 --> 2:44:16.240]  what Caesar and so the world is gonna run its system the banks are gonna but we
[2:44:16.240 --> 2:44:21.040]  have our souls and I see the enemy consolidating its power but I see God
[2:44:21.040 --> 2:44:26.720]  consolidating his power in the people I see the separation reading them yeah
[2:44:26.720 --> 2:44:33.640]  totally the church has to be allowed boys the preachers have to be you we
[2:44:33.640 --> 2:44:37.960]  can't you can't hide in fear if you watching today and you're afraid and
[2:44:37.960 --> 2:44:41.760]  even you going about your daily business you're afraid of getting a sick or
[2:44:41.760 --> 2:44:48.080]  dying we live through h1n one we live through the bird flu fear is the real
[2:44:48.080 --> 2:44:52.520]  virus panicking is the real virus their studies showing hysteria over the virus
[2:44:52.520 --> 2:44:58.160]  is causing all sorts of illnesses yeah people are living a total paranoia and
[2:44:58.160 --> 2:45:01.680]  then they start screaming at somebody else you're not wearing a mask as I
[2:45:01.680 --> 2:45:06.160]  tell everybody to try to bring the mask out now make it mandatory it's like
[2:45:06.160 --> 2:45:11.600]  bringing contraceptives to a baby shower exactly I've been in my car and
[2:45:11.600 --> 2:45:17.080]  people pull up and cuss at me without wearing a mask in my car I've lost his
[2:45:17.080 --> 2:45:21.760]  voice I can't hear him can you hear me now pastor

[2:47:23.360 --> 2:47:29.320]  media falsely claims that I said that somebody killed a woman in Charlottesville
[2:47:29.320 --> 2:47:33.520]  I said the Democrats had it two groups collide the police did it to create the
[2:47:33.520 --> 2:47:37.920]  crisis to get what they wanted and Georgetown University funded by the
[2:47:37.920 --> 2:47:43.680]  Vatican the Vatican is suing us and trying to shut down our free speech so
[2:47:43.680 --> 2:47:48.600]  between the Vatican and the ADL and just all of it it is just an anti-American
[2:47:48.600 --> 2:47:53.400]  nightmare but your funding of info wars getting great products that make you and

[2:48:05.760 --> 2:48:11.120]  take over her Britannic Majesty's London we're right back to do it
[2:48:13.800 --> 2:48:19.120]  the globalist want us domesticated they want us inside our homes watching our
[2:48:19.120 --> 2:48:23.640]  televisions and being controlled by our quote smartphones everybody knows this
[2:48:23.640 --> 2:48:27.200]  it's their admitted goal we've had whistleblowers from Facebook Twitter and
[2:48:27.200 --> 2:48:31.640]  Google go public and say at the highest levels their job is to make you new
[2:48:31.640 --> 2:48:36.280]  erotic destroy your mind and take over your life and now the COVID hysteria is
[2:48:36.280 --> 2:48:40.880]  all about that I recently had a woman in the street walls with my youngest daughter
[2:48:40.880 --> 2:48:46.400]  and my daughter walked close to her as she said get away six feet and gave her a
[2:48:46.400 --> 2:48:51.200]  super ugly look this ladies and gentlemen is mental illness my daughter
[2:48:51.200 --> 2:48:55.320]  walking four feet from some old woman is not a crime the old woman's mental
[2:48:55.320 --> 2:49:02.000]  illness is the crime if we give in to it this is total and complete mind control
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:06.600]  we must expose the COVID hoax now they're gonna continue to clamp down
[2:49:06.600 --> 2:49:10.480]  using this it's a UN Bill Gates plan they've been proven to be criminal liars
[2:49:10.480 --> 2:49:15.440]  and they must be defeated they must be exposed
[2:49:15.440 --> 2:49:21.520]  sisters are saying what I was privately saying the crew last night we may have
[2:49:21.520 --> 2:49:25.040]  just broken not just the biggest story in info war history but one of the
[2:49:25.040 --> 2:49:32.080]  biggest stories period the state of Texas confirms that the CDC and NIH have
[2:49:32.080 --> 2:49:38.400]  created a system where anyone that has the sore throat or a runny nose or who
[2:49:38.400 --> 2:49:43.360]  has been in contact with someone COVID-19 is then added into the database as
[2:49:43.360 --> 2:49:48.640]  having a case that is counted as a case of COVID-19 it's in the NIH documents it's
[2:49:48.640 --> 2:49:51.880]  at the state level we confirmed it in Texas we're not confirming it's in other
[2:49:51.880 --> 2:49:56.320]  states this is beyond the other smoking guns of them putting people to die
[2:49:56.320 --> 2:50:00.560]  gunshot wounds and stuff in the COVID column and the false positive test
[2:50:00.560 --> 2:50:06.880]  that's all huge this is beyond that mega criminal activity and we've got these
[2:50:06.880 --> 2:50:09.960]  different kind of commission videos where they're just freaking out over it
[2:50:09.960 --> 2:50:13.680]  saying what in the world is this the full video is posted at band-on video
[2:50:13.680 --> 2:50:16.840]  get it out expose the hoax
[2:50:16.840 --> 2:50:28.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show all Joseph Watson is about to take
[2:50:28.040 --> 2:50:31.480]  over but this report so powerful I'm gonna air it twice today in the same
[2:50:31.480 --> 2:50:37.040]  show worldwide population being torched in deep state sign up Gregory's here's
[2:50:37.040 --> 2:50:43.320]  the report at band-on video please share it this report is based on amazing
[2:50:43.320 --> 2:50:49.760]  Polly's recent video is this torture in her video Polly examines amnesty
[2:50:49.760 --> 2:50:56.600]  internationals 1973 report on torture and how it seems to reflect the current
[2:50:56.600 --> 2:51:03.880]  response to COVID-19 according to amnesty internationals report torture is the
[2:51:03.880 --> 2:51:09.880]  systematic and deliberate inflection of acute pain in any form by one person on
[2:51:09.880 --> 2:51:14.680]  another in order to accomplish the purpose of the former against the will
[2:51:14.680 --> 2:51:20.920]  of the latter the report then uses Biederman's chart of coercion to describe
[2:51:20.920 --> 2:51:26.960]  the technique psychologist Albert Biederman studied communist Chinese
[2:51:26.960 --> 2:51:35.240]  tactics known as DDD debility dependency and dread the CIA has been trained to
[2:51:35.240 --> 2:51:42.160]  use debility dependency and dread and according to their 1983 human resource
[2:51:42.160 --> 2:51:47.480]  exploitation training manual many psychologists consider the threat of
[2:51:47.480 --> 2:51:54.240]  inducing debility to be more effective than debility itself with DDD the
[2:51:54.240 --> 2:51:59.840]  debilitated victim becomes dependent upon the torturer and develops a strong
[2:51:59.840 --> 2:52:06.720]  fear of anything vague or unknown Biederman's chart of coercion lays out
[2:52:06.720 --> 2:52:17.440]  the design of DDD does any of this sound familiar number one isolation we see
[2:52:17.440 --> 2:52:21.520]  this with quarantines and social distancing and the prohibition of
[2:52:21.520 --> 2:52:28.040]  crowds and large gatherings number two monopolization of perception corporate
[2:52:28.040 --> 2:52:33.200]  mainstream media has monopolized all of pop culture and those on social media
[2:52:33.200 --> 2:52:38.440]  who challenge the mainstream narrative are censored also listed is restricted
[2:52:38.440 --> 2:52:45.920]  movement and monotonous food number three induced debilitation and exhaustion
[2:52:45.920 --> 2:52:52.720]  gym closures church closures losing your job school closings and wearing masks
[2:52:52.720 --> 2:52:59.800]  all day long increase stress and provokes exhaustion and debilitation number
[2:52:59.800 --> 2:53:05.600]  four threats we are threatened that our own children may be taken away from our
[2:53:05.600 --> 2:53:11.960]  homes and that experimental force vaccines are coming we are told that more
[2:53:11.960 --> 2:53:17.080]  will die if we restart America and we are threatened with tracking chips
[2:53:17.080 --> 2:53:25.640]  contact tracing and a new normal number five occasional indulgences here we
[2:53:25.640 --> 2:53:32.400]  find fluctuations of interrogators attitudes such as BLM protests are good
[2:53:32.400 --> 2:53:39.240]  Trump rallies are bad Walmart is okay but small businesses are not the
[2:53:39.240 --> 2:53:44.920]  torturer will provide occasional indulgences such as rewards for partial
[2:53:44.920 --> 2:53:52.080]  compliance if you just wear a mask someday we can return to normal number
[2:53:52.080 --> 2:53:57.720]  six demonstrating omnipotence and omniscience shutting down the entire
[2:53:57.720 --> 2:54:03.520]  global economy was a pretty good demonstration of omnipotence huge fines
[2:54:03.520 --> 2:54:09.520]  and jail for people not wearing a mask we see the omniscience with Anthony
[2:54:09.520 --> 2:54:16.360]  Fauci Bill Gates and other official experts number seven is degradation
[2:54:16.360 --> 2:54:23.040]  being called non-essential or a science denier being treated as ignorant fools
[2:54:23.040 --> 2:54:30.080]  and called names by celebrities for not complying number eight enforcing
[2:54:30.080 --> 2:54:36.800]  trivial demands this final step develops habits of compliance enforcement of
[2:54:36.800 --> 2:54:43.560]  minute rules such as standing six feet apart following arrows and showing
[2:54:43.560 --> 2:54:51.680]  support for violent BLM protests also according to the report on torture many
[2:54:51.680 --> 2:54:56.680]  victims become ill as a result of coercion and more than half the
[2:54:56.680 --> 2:55:02.840]  illnesses listed in the report can be easily diagnosed as COVID-19 according
[2:55:02.840 --> 2:55:09.520]  to CDC guidelines do you really think that this is all a coincidence where
[2:55:09.520 --> 2:55:13.080]  are the people of the world being subjected to an advanced form of
[2:55:13.080 --> 2:55:23.880]  torture coercion and mind control for info wars calm this is Greg Reese the

[2:56:38.240 --> 2:56:51.240]  and we are live we are going to get into the latest things that
[2:56:51.240 --> 2:56:55.120]  racist of course many new things are racist on a daily basis is going to
[2:56:55.120 --> 2:57:00.600]  cover that also going to get into the actor Terry Cruz who appeared on don
[2:57:00.600 --> 2:57:05.720]  lemon on CNN last night and he was in a lot of hot water recently because he
[2:57:05.720 --> 2:57:09.240]  made the point and wait for it because this is pretty controversial he made
[2:57:09.240 --> 2:57:14.960]  the point on Twitter but not all white people are bad yeah that sounds really
[2:57:14.960 --> 2:57:19.240]  daring really bold statement to make but he was in hot water for saying that he
[2:57:19.240 --> 2:57:23.000]  was in hot water for saying that if black lives matter maybe we should
[2:57:23.000 --> 2:57:27.080]  concentrate on the biggest threat to black lives in America which is other
[2:57:27.080 --> 2:57:32.240]  black people now of the July 4th weekend we had an eight-year-old girl in
[2:57:32.240 --> 2:57:38.760]  Atlanta shot dead during a BLM protest we had another seven-year-old in Chicago
[2:57:38.760 --> 2:57:43.400]  who was shot in the head while waiting on the sidewalk outside her grandmother's
[2:57:43.400 --> 2:57:49.000]  house we had 67 people shot in Chicago over the weekend so Terry Cruz
[2:57:49.000 --> 2:57:52.840]  gets up on CNN and says maybe this should be a segment maybe this should be
[2:57:52.840 --> 2:57:56.960]  part of the discussion when we talked about black lives matter don lemon shot
[2:57:56.960 --> 2:58:01.720]  back and basically said no black lives matter should solely be about police
[2:58:01.720 --> 2:58:05.440]  brutality and criminal justice even though we know from black lives matters own
[2:58:05.440 --> 2:58:09.920]  statements that it's not it's about defunding the police it's about
[2:58:09.920 --> 2:58:14.320]  overthrowing capitalism and it's about breaking up the quote nuclear family so
[2:58:14.320 --> 2:58:18.240]  we're gonna get into that in the next segment first of all we're gonna find
[2:58:18.240 --> 2:58:24.120]  out the new things that are racist as of today it's a changing spectrum on a
[2:58:24.120 --> 2:58:30.720]  daily basis so it's you know very important to keep track headline UK
[2:58:30.720 --> 2:58:35.280]  estate agents to drop term master bedroom to placate politically correct
[2:58:35.280 --> 2:58:41.160]  millennials that's right the term master bedroom and the term master bathroom in
[2:58:41.160 --> 2:58:48.080]  terms of descriptions property for sale is now apparently racist of course we
[2:58:48.080 --> 2:58:52.360]  had this in the US with some realtors in Texas saying the same thing well now
[2:58:52.360 --> 2:58:57.880]  as state agents across the UK are set to stop using the term master bedroom in
[2:58:57.880 --> 2:59:01.240]  order to placate politically correct millennials who think such language is
[2:59:01.240 --> 2:59:06.800]  racist the rooms will instead be described as principle or primary in the
[2:59:06.800 --> 2:59:12.200]  hope of warding off the potential anger of easily offended morons who again
[2:59:12.200 --> 2:59:17.160]  represent such a tiny minority of the population who would be going to visit a
[2:59:17.160 --> 2:59:21.600]  property whether they're looking at renting it or buying it and see a
[2:59:21.600 --> 2:59:25.680]  description of a master bedroom and think that's racist I'm not going to see
[2:59:25.680 --> 2:59:30.280]  the property what tiny percentage of imbeciles would actually go through that
[2:59:30.280 --> 2:59:34.720]  thought process but again it's the noisy minority that is literally taking over
[2:59:34.720 --> 2:59:40.960]  society in this cultural revolution now we had Peter whether all of whether all
[2:59:40.960 --> 2:59:45.560]  estate agents in Mayfair London who said this these changes are being driven by
[2:59:45.560 --> 2:59:49.160]  political correctness and dramatic transformations in the bio demographic
[2:59:49.160 --> 2:59:54.760]  across crime central London again be very careful when you talk about
[2:59:54.760 --> 2:59:59.000]  demographics in anything other than a positive light of course you went on to
[2:59:59.000 --> 3:00:04.000]  say the typical buyers are now aged from the early 20s to their mid 40s and from
[3:00:04.000 --> 3:00:09.520]  all over the world this young demographic sense be very broad minded when in
[3:00:09.520 --> 3:00:13.760]  actual fact they're the opposite of broad minded their totalitarian control
[3:00:13.760 --> 3:00:17.680]  freaks who want to literally control the words that come out of your mouth very
[3:00:17.680 --> 3:00:24.800]  broad minded though and find any form of sexism or racism deeply offensive perhaps
[3:00:24.800 --> 3:00:28.440]  living in fear of the same irate mob that tore down the Edward Colston statue
[3:00:28.440 --> 3:00:33.320]  and threw it in the river David Westgate the group chief executive of the
[3:00:33.320 --> 3:00:38.240]  Bristol based estate agent chain Andrews said quote the sentiment behind the
[3:00:38.240 --> 3:00:42.200]  black lives matter campaign has helped us all be more aware of our behavior
[3:00:42.200 --> 3:00:49.920]  literally some estate agent in Bristol in some town in the UK is self-flage
[3:00:49.920 --> 3:00:53.880]  relating over black lives matter because in the property descriptions of his
[3:00:53.880 --> 3:01:00.560]  properties they use the term master bedroom now the term master bedroom in
[3:01:00.560 --> 3:01:06.920]  that context was only used in the United Kingdom in 1925 was the first recorded
[3:01:06.920 --> 3:01:12.920]  instance of its use according to the dictionary nearly a hundred years after
[3:01:12.920 --> 3:01:17.200]  slavery was officially abolished throughout the UK by the way we were
[3:01:17.200 --> 3:01:20.920]  the first country in the world to officially abolish slavery but apparently
[3:01:20.920 --> 3:01:26.560]  we're also to blame for it the Barbary slave trade which enslaved people from
[3:01:26.560 --> 3:01:31.160]  my generation people from my ancestry that doesn't matter we're not asking
[3:01:31.160 --> 3:01:36.400]  Arabs for any reparations there were a couple of estate agents which I quoted
[3:01:36.400 --> 3:01:41.800]  in this article who actually engaged their common sense thinking process one
[3:01:41.800 --> 3:01:45.920]  of whom was Trevor Abramson the managing director of Glentree International he
[3:01:45.920 --> 3:01:49.720]  said the phrase master bedroom wasn't used until the early 20th century if
[3:01:49.720 --> 3:01:53.120]  the woke liberal elite want to equate that with slaves and masters that is
[3:01:53.120 --> 3:01:57.760]  ridiculous and yet the others are all bowing down and metaphorically taking
[3:01:57.760 --> 3:02:00.800]  the knee Edward Heaton the founder of Heaton and
[3:02:00.800 --> 3:02:04.920]  Potters echoed his sentiment remarking it's ludicrous that we should be
[3:02:04.920 --> 3:02:08.400]  expected to ignore our history and heritage to placate a vociferous
[3:02:08.400 --> 3:02:15.400]  minority and yet that is exactly what's happening so master bedrooms now racist
[3:02:15.400 --> 3:02:21.120]  what else is racist well Shakespeare is racist yes the book burners all back
[3:02:21.120 --> 3:02:29.400]  Fahrenheit 451 in full effect Fahrenheit 451 force being the Ray Bradbury book
[3:02:29.400 --> 3:02:34.520]  which they later made into a movie dystopian thriller based on a total
[3:02:34.520 --> 3:02:39.000] itarian society where firefighters didn't put out fires they burned books
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:44.920]  and that's a big cause celebrate of the mainstream media in recent weeks of
[3:02:44.920 --> 3:02:50.720]  course and now we have the Washington Post talking about purifying Shakespeare
[3:02:50.720 --> 3:02:57.560]  if not eliminating it altogether by the way I put out a tweet on June 11 which
[3:02:57.560 --> 3:03:01.800]  cited an academic paper from a few years ago which said quote William Shakespeare
[3:03:01.800 --> 3:03:05.640]  wrote several plays which depict Jews and blacks in a very negative stereotypical
[3:03:05.640 --> 3:03:11.240]  fashion time for audible and Amazon to delete such offensive trash let's see
[3:03:11.240 --> 3:03:15.960]  how far down this rabbit hole goes and now less than a month later the
[3:03:15.960 --> 3:03:20.080]  Washington Post comes out with an article this is a headline out of the
[3:03:20.080 --> 3:03:25.360]  website moon battery which commentates on this Washington Post article headline
[3:03:25.360 --> 3:03:30.600]  Washington Post now let's purge classic literature what's next what's the next
[3:03:30.600 --> 3:03:33.600]  target for the liberal mob after tearing down statues of the titans of
[3:03:33.600 --> 3:03:37.040]  American history and getting people fired over the most trivial infractions
[3:03:37.040 --> 3:03:40.680]  against political correctness any student of totalitarianism knows the
[3:03:40.680 --> 3:03:46.240]  likely answer books because it was the German philosopher his name slits my
[3:03:46.240 --> 3:03:49.800]  mind for the moment but he said basically to paraphrase where once they
[3:03:49.800 --> 3:03:55.520]  burn books next they will burn people of course the left doesn't quite have
[3:03:55.520 --> 3:03:59.720]  enough political control yet to do that but in terms of long march through the
[3:03:59.720 --> 3:04:04.520]  institutions they're certainly ahead of the game the writing in the Washington
[3:04:04.520 --> 3:04:09.440]  Post Ron Charles celebrates the war on statues and the purging of old television
[3:04:09.440 --> 3:04:14.360]  programs of anything currently regarded as offensive by liberals now he wants to
[3:04:14.360 --> 3:04:18.840]  purge literature he starts at the top with Shakespeare and then he quotes from
[3:04:18.840 --> 3:04:24.680]  the article where they say a fellow the Shakespeare play and they point out that
[3:04:24.680 --> 3:04:29.240]  one of the characters the Venetian general is manipulated into murderous
[3:04:29.240 --> 3:04:34.400]  rage by his villainous white colleague even before a fellow comes on stage he's
[3:04:34.400 --> 3:04:39.200]  subjected to obscene racist ridicule so the Washington Post is now basically
[3:04:39.200 --> 3:04:44.400]  calling for all Shakespeare plays to be run through a modern day social justice
[3:04:44.400 --> 3:04:48.440]  purity test before they're allowed to be performed and if they don't well maybe
[3:04:48.440 --> 3:04:54.680]  they're not going to be performed at all so master bedroom is racist Shakespeare
[3:04:54.680 --> 3:05:01.720]  is racist what else is racist wasps are racist again from moon battery wasp
[3:05:01.720 --> 3:05:06.640]  mascot under fire by anti-white racist the purge of all things associated with
[3:05:06.640 --> 3:05:10.280]  America's heritage in core population has reached such a hysterical frenzy that
[3:05:10.280 --> 3:05:15.560]  not even insects are safe this is emory and Henry College in Virginia which has
[3:05:15.560 --> 3:05:20.880]  announced to students that the school will reexamine its wasp mascot why the
[3:05:20.880 --> 3:05:26.200]  bug may appear exclusive to students who are not why Anglo-Saxon Protestants or
[3:05:26.200 --> 3:05:31.560]  wasps so again it's not even got anything to do with that but the insect
[3:05:31.560 --> 3:05:36.120]  apparently the insect wasp is now racist as well
[3:05:36.120 --> 3:05:41.200]  whales is racist that's official as of today the country of Wales in the United
[3:05:41.200 --> 3:05:45.840]  Kingdom is racist the black demographic the black population of Wales is
[3:05:45.840 --> 3:05:50.640]  miniscule the white demographic the white population of Wales is 95%
[3:05:50.640 --> 3:05:55.680]  it's 95% white and yet now the leader of the Welsh government reports
[3:05:55.680 --> 3:06:00.200]  Breitbart has announced an urgent audit of statues street names and building
[3:06:00.200 --> 3:06:04.720]  names to address whales as connections with the slave trade and of course the
[3:06:04.720 --> 3:06:08.560]  move was inspired by weeks of protest by the Marxist black lives matter campaign
[3:06:08.560 --> 3:06:14.400]  so Welsh roads are racist wasps are racist Shakespeare's racist master bedrooms
[3:06:14.400 --> 3:06:20.840]  are also racist and that's not even being tied away so it don't use we'll be right back

[3:08:21.880 --> 3:08:36.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show you're listening to the summit.news
[3:08:36.920 --> 3:08:46.240]  radio hour with Paul Joseph Watson. Now the actor Terry Cruz appeared on CNN with
[3:08:46.240 --> 3:08:49.480]  Don Lemon last night to ask the question why the black lives only
[3:08:49.480 --> 3:08:53.680]  appear to matter to the black lives matter movement when they're taken by
[3:08:53.680 --> 3:08:59.400]  white people. Now he was in hot water over the past few nights since July 4th
[3:08:59.400 --> 3:09:04.200]  and in fact there's a Chiron you know the text at the bottom of the screen on
[3:09:04.200 --> 3:09:08.760]  CNN where it says Terry Cruz defends his statement of uniting with good people
[3:09:08.760 --> 3:09:13.760]  black or white as if that would be a controversial statement to make his
[3:09:13.760 --> 3:09:18.480]  initial tweet said quote are all white people bad no for all black people good
[3:09:18.480 --> 3:09:22.600]  no knowing this reality I stand on my decision to unite with good people no
[3:09:22.600 --> 3:09:27.160]  matter the race, creed or ideology and for that tweet although he got a lot of
[3:09:27.160 --> 3:09:32.880]  support he also got a lot of hatred from the woke pitchfork mob on Twitter now
[3:09:32.880 --> 3:09:37.520]  he followed that up with another tweet yesterday in response to the massive
[3:09:37.520 --> 3:09:42.080]  wave of violence in Chicago over the weekend he said nine black children
[3:09:42.080 --> 3:09:48.920]  killed by violence in Chicago since June 20th hashtag all black lives matter then
[3:09:48.920 --> 3:09:53.400]  he appeared on CNN with Don Lemon and Don Lemon basically tried to argue that
[3:09:53.400 --> 3:09:57.800]  no the biggest threat to black lives being other black people in America
[3:09:57.800 --> 3:10:01.840]  should not be a part of the black lives matter movement let's go to clip number
[3:10:01.840 --> 3:10:07.080]  one this is the apples and oranges clip let's roll it here it is and one thing
[3:10:07.080 --> 3:10:12.880]  who's the next oppressor who's the next oppressor oh when I when I described
[3:10:12.880 --> 3:10:17.440]  this when you look in the city of Chicago there are nine children who died
[3:10:17.440 --> 3:10:24.800]  by gun violence by black-on-black gun violence with from June 20th all the way
[3:10:24.800 --> 3:10:28.600]  to today and you're talking about even with the Atlanta child murders there
[3:10:28.600 --> 3:10:34.120]  were 28 kids who died during two years you're talking about a month and you
[3:10:34.120 --> 3:10:38.760]  have nine black kids and the black lives matter movement has said nothing about
[3:10:38.760 --> 3:10:42.160]  what does that have to do with equality though Terry I have to tell I don't
[3:10:42.160 --> 3:10:44.760]  understand what that has to do with equality because they're there listen
[3:10:44.760 --> 3:10:47.400]  there's crime there are people in those communities who are those people are just
[3:10:47.400 --> 3:10:51.880]  being nonchalant about about gun violence I live in Chicago there are many
[3:10:51.880 --> 3:10:55.280]  people who are working in those communities to try to get rid of the gun
[3:10:55.280 --> 3:11:00.120]  violence is the gun culture in this in this country is prevalent but I don't
[3:11:00.120 --> 3:11:04.920]  understand what that has to do with a movement that's for equality for black
[3:11:04.920 --> 3:11:09.800]  people it's it there is not mutually exclusive that you care about equality
[3:11:09.800 --> 3:11:15.520]  for black people that somehow you're going to stop random violence or
[3:11:15.520 --> 3:11:22.040]  unfortunately kids from being shot it just seems like apples and oranges you
[3:11:22.040 --> 3:11:27.400]  know it's not that way you know this is the thing done you know black people
[3:11:27.400 --> 3:11:31.720]  need to hold other black people accountable I said this the same thing
[3:11:31.720 --> 3:11:37.240]  and this is the black America's version of the me too movement if anything is
[3:11:37.240 --> 3:11:43.200]  going to change we ourselves need to look at our own communities and look at
[3:11:43.200 --> 3:11:48.800]  each other and say this thing cannot go down and this is the thing too there are
[3:11:48.800 --> 3:11:53.800]  a lot of great great people there who are held hostage who are held hostage by
[3:11:53.800 --> 3:11:59.920]  people who literally are running these neighborhoods with violence and then
[3:11:59.920 --> 3:12:06.880]  claiming that black lives matter so there you have Don Lemon arguing that
[3:12:06.880 --> 3:12:10.880]  there's no equality in America for black people of course white people have the
[3:12:10.880 --> 3:12:15.480]  exact same rights in America that white people have he also tried to argue
[3:12:15.480 --> 3:12:20.400]  later on and in fact we're gonna roll this clip he tried to argue in that piece
[3:12:20.400 --> 3:12:25.320]  that we saw that we saw just there that black people don't have the same rights
[3:12:25.320 --> 3:12:29.480]  and then he tried to argue that this was about gun culture in Chicago and not
[3:12:29.480 --> 3:12:39.480]  black on black violence let's roll the second clip here it is Terry your
[3:12:39.480 --> 3:12:42.400]  high-profile person you're writing things out there you know you're gonna get
[3:12:42.400 --> 3:12:45.960]  backlash you know people are gonna respond to what you're saying on Twitter so
[3:12:45.960 --> 3:12:49.640]  I just I don't think you should be surprised by that I you know I have a
[3:12:49.640 --> 3:12:54.240]  skin as tough as an armadillo because of what I do and I think maybe you should
[3:12:54.240 --> 3:12:59.360]  adapt that but here's here's what I have to say the black lives matter movement
[3:12:59.360 --> 3:13:03.080]  was started because it was talking about police brutality if you want an all
[3:13:03.080 --> 3:13:07.640]  black lives matter movement that talks about gun violence in communities
[3:13:07.640 --> 3:13:11.920]  including you know black communities then start that movement with that name
[3:13:11.920 --> 3:13:17.280]  but that's not what black lives matter is about it's not an all-encompassing so
[3:13:17.280 --> 3:13:22.920]  if you're talking about if someone started moving that said cancer matters
[3:13:22.920 --> 3:13:26.480]  and then someone comes in and said why aren't you talking about HIV it's not
[3:13:26.480 --> 3:13:30.720]  the same thing we're talking about cancer so the black lives matter movement is
[3:13:30.720 --> 3:13:36.320]  about police brutality and injustice in that manner not about what's happening
[3:13:36.320 --> 3:13:39.920]  in black neighborhoods if you there are people who are working on that issue and
[3:13:39.920 --> 3:13:45.800]  if you want to start that issue why don't you start it do you understand what
[3:13:45.800 --> 3:13:51.200]  I'm saying would you but when you look at the organization police brutality is
[3:13:51.200 --> 3:13:55.400]  not the only thing they're talking about I know that I agree but that's not what
[3:13:55.400 --> 3:13:59.280]  the black lives matter movement is about Terry black lives matters about
[3:13:59.280 --> 3:14:04.760]  brutality and about and about criminal justice it's not about what happens in
[3:14:04.760 --> 3:14:09.200]  communities when it comes to crime black on black crime people who live near
[3:14:09.200 --> 3:14:13.480]  each other black people kill each other same as whites 80 some percent of white
[3:14:13.480 --> 3:14:17.320]  people are killed by white people true because of proximity very true the same
[3:14:17.320 --> 3:14:21.320]  thing with black people but it happens in every single neighborhood but that
[3:14:21.320 --> 3:14:24.560]  isn't again I'm not saying that's not important that those those those kids
[3:14:24.560 --> 3:14:31.680]  died but it's a different movement so you hear Don Lemon try to claim its
[3:14:31.680 --> 3:14:35.360]  apples and oranges to try to bring into the equation the industrial level of
[3:14:35.360 --> 3:14:39.760]  violence committed by black people against other black people in Chicago in
[3:14:39.760 --> 3:14:44.640]  Atlanta as we saw over the weekend 14 people shot in just one street in
[3:14:44.640 --> 3:14:49.880]  Chicago a seven-year-old sorry an eight-year-old girl shot dead at and
[3:14:49.880 --> 3:14:55.000]  during a BLM protest because her mother tried to reverse the car and parked the
[3:14:55.000 --> 3:14:58.960]  car in an area where a BLM protest was taking place they shot out the tires
[3:14:58.960 --> 3:15:03.840]  they shot the little girl dead we had another instance in Chicago where a
[3:15:03.840 --> 3:15:06.920]  seven-year-old black girl was shot on the street on the sidewalk outside her
[3:15:06.920 --> 3:15:11.120]  grandmother's house what's to blame for that according to Don Lemon gun
[3:15:11.120 --> 3:15:15.080]  culture because you really see white people killing each other on an
[3:15:15.080 --> 3:15:19.600]  industrial scale in white areas of the country which have high gun ownership
[3:15:19.600 --> 3:15:24.800]  don't you know you don't this is nothing to do with gun culture you then
[3:15:24.800 --> 3:15:28.840]  tries to argue that talking about black-on-black violence would be like a
[3:15:28.840 --> 3:15:33.280]  cancer matters movement being asked why they don't talk about HIV but again is a
[3:15:33.280 --> 3:15:38.440]  complete misnomer because the full scope of BLM is not just about police
[3:15:38.440 --> 3:15:43.280]  brutality or criminal justice reform as Don Lemon claims you can go to their
[3:15:43.280 --> 3:15:47.720]  website you can listen to their leaders it's about overthrowing capitalism
[3:15:47.720 --> 3:15:53.800]  imposing communist ideals defunding the police and of course they talk about
[3:15:53.800 --> 3:15:59.160]  breaking up the nuclear family so no it's not about one single issue as Don
[3:15:59.160 --> 3:16:04.640]  Lemon claims based on what the leaders of Black Lives Matter themselves say and
[3:16:04.640 --> 3:16:08.600]  then the interview ends with Cruz insisting that there is more to the
[3:16:08.600 --> 3:16:13.560]  BLM agenda than police brutality and then it needed to be scrutinized and Don
[3:16:13.560 --> 3:16:17.920]  Lemon half admits that but then brings it back and does a complete 180 again
[3:16:17.920 --> 3:16:21.360]  and claims it's just about police brutality when we know it's not the
[3:16:21.360 --> 3:16:26.280]  fact is as I write in this article black-on-black violence isn't part of
[3:16:26.280 --> 3:16:30.600]  the Black Lives Matter narrative because Black Lives Matter isn't a civil rights
[3:16:30.600 --> 3:16:35.200]  movement it's a mammoth political movement and black-on-black violence
[3:16:35.200 --> 3:16:39.960]  can't be exploited for political gris which is why people like Don Lemon
[3:16:39.960 --> 3:16:43.920]  don't talk about it which is why people like Don Lemon don't talk about the
[3:16:43.920 --> 3:16:48.240]  findings of Black Lives Matter the fact that the inspirational guru the
[3:16:48.240 --> 3:16:52.400]  philosophical guru behind Black Lives Matter as I've said on many occasions a
[3:16:52.400 --> 3:16:58.040]  starter she called is literally a cop killing terrorist fugitive who has to
[3:16:58.040 --> 3:17:02.600]  hide out in Cuba to avoid the FBI because she's on their top 10 most
[3:17:02.600 --> 3:17:08.440]  wanted terrorist list so yes it has its origins in extremism and its leaders
[3:17:08.440 --> 3:17:13.560]  often spout political agendas that have absolutely nothing to do with police
[3:17:13.560 --> 3:17:17.960]  brutality Don Lemon knows that we'll get more into this on the other side summit
[3:17:17.960 --> 3:17:23.360]  news don't go away as we enter the critical months of July it is very
[3:17:23.360 --> 3:17:27.640]  important for listeners and viewers to understand that all of the major
[3:17:27.640 --> 3:17:32.760]  storable food companies have been sold out of food for months my patriots
[3:17:32.760 --> 3:17:37.200]  supply our supplier was out to an eight-week wait not because they didn't
[3:17:37.200 --> 3:17:40.800]  have food but because their four plants were backed up packaging and getting it
[3:17:40.800 --> 3:17:46.120]  out now they are at three to four weeks right now they've gotten over the hump
[3:17:46.120 --> 3:17:51.400]  their other competitors are completely sold out or selling old garbage this is
[3:17:51.400 --> 3:17:55.280]  high-quality food I would advise everyone to do what I'm doing and buy more
[3:17:55.280 --> 3:17:59.840]  storable food now before the next big hump comes because if you think things
[3:17:59.840 --> 3:18:04.600]  are about to settle down think again the world is only gonna get more insane I've
[3:18:04.600 --> 3:18:07.320]  been telling you this for six months ladies and gentlemen if you don't have

[3:19:07.840 --> 3:19:10.240]  had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it
[3:19:10.240 --> 3:19:14.400]  and we believe it is the best strongest but healthiest energy out there and

[3:20:16.960 --> 3:20:20.800]  support again I salute you all
[3:20:20.800 --> 3:20:26.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:32.320 --> 3:20:38.800]  you're listening to summit.news with Paul Joseph Watson
[3:20:39.800 --> 3:20:44.400]  so again I asked the question why does the black lives matter movement only
[3:20:44.400 --> 3:20:48.960]  appear to care about black lives when they're taken by white people why does
[3:20:48.960 --> 3:20:54.040]  Don Lemon not appear to care about black lives when they're taken by other
[3:20:54.040 --> 3:20:57.840]  black people why is that not part of the conversation when that's the biggest
[3:20:57.840 --> 3:21:03.800]  threat to black lives it's very simple over the July 4th weekend we had an
[3:21:03.800 --> 3:21:09.400]  eight-year-old girl shot dead during a BLM protest in Atlanta by a BLM
[3:21:09.400 --> 3:21:13.280]  activist imagine if a right-wing extremist would shot an eight-year-old
[3:21:13.280 --> 3:21:18.760]  black girl dead during a BLM rally that would be a headline for months it was
[3:21:18.760 --> 3:21:24.720]  barely even reported it was reported in local media and not really highlighted
[3:21:24.720 --> 3:21:31.240]  anywhere else we had 14 shot during a street party in Atlanta on July 4th we
[3:21:31.240 --> 3:21:38.280]  had 67 shot 13 fatally in Chicago over the July 4th weekend including a seven
[3:21:38.280 --> 3:21:41.320]  year old girl who was shot in the head while stood on the sidewalk again the
[3:21:41.320 --> 3:21:47.120]  vast majority of those victims and perpetrators were black where is the BLM
[3:21:47.120 --> 3:21:52.520]  March for these victims of crime we had a headline here out of Summit News
[3:21:52.520 --> 3:21:57.080]  yesterday you shot and killed the baby Atlanta mayor decries black on black
[3:21:57.080 --> 3:22:00.360]  violence during BLM March and to her credit she came and gave a press
[3:22:00.360 --> 3:22:04.720]  conference and spoke out about this she later caught coronavirus or admitted
[3:22:04.720 --> 3:22:08.960]  that she got coronavirus and that became a bigger story an eight-year-old black
[3:22:08.960 --> 3:22:13.000]  girl was shot dead inside a car during a black lives matter protest leading the
[3:22:13.000 --> 3:22:17.280]  mayor of Atlanta to proclaim we are shooting each other on our streets this
[3:22:17.280 --> 3:22:22.560]  shooting happened near the same Wendy's that was torched by BLM protesters in
[3:22:22.560 --> 3:22:26.880]  response to the police killing the Rayshard Brooks less than a month ago
[3:22:26.880 --> 3:22:30.920]  which of course made massive headlines made massive social media traction an
[3:22:30.920 --> 3:22:36.280]  eight-year-old girl gets shot dead in the same place during a BLM rally and it's
[3:22:36.280 --> 3:22:40.520]  barely a footnote the crowd of protesters gathered there and erected
[3:22:40.520 --> 3:22:44.800]  barricades a car and it was being driven by I presume the mother of this
[3:22:44.800 --> 3:22:49.440]  eight-year-old child because she was also in the press conference so a car tried
[3:22:49.440 --> 3:22:53.560]  to drive into this parking area at which there was a BLM protests taking place
[3:22:53.560 --> 3:22:58.520]  and two people at least two people and last time I checked they hadn't caught
[3:22:58.520 --> 3:23:01.320]  them if they've caught them today that would be a new development as of yesterday
[3:23:01.320 --> 3:23:05.840]  they hadn't caught them two people in the crowd opened fire at the vehicle
[3:23:05.840 --> 3:23:10.840]  hitting Sikoria Turner eight years old police said she later died from her
[3:23:10.840 --> 3:23:15.680]  wounds again I didn't see Sean King talking about this I didn't see any of
[3:23:15.680 --> 3:23:20.200]  the black lives matter leadership talking about this until a credit mayor
[3:23:20.200 --> 3:23:23.760]  Keisha Lance Bottoms talked about it she said you can't blame it on police
[3:23:23.760 --> 3:23:27.240]  officers you can't say it's about criminal justice reform this is about
[3:23:27.240 --> 3:23:31.760]  some people carrying weapons who shot up a car with an eight-year-old baby for
[3:23:31.760 --> 3:23:38.000]  what as I talked about in this article meanwhile elsewhere in Atlanta 14 people
[3:23:38.000 --> 3:23:43.280]  were shot and two died during a July 4th Street Party on Auburn Avenue and you
[3:23:43.280 --> 3:23:45.960]  can watch the video which is in the article which shows of course the
[3:23:45.960 --> 3:23:49.920]  virtually all of the attendees at this Street Party were black the people
[3:23:49.920 --> 3:23:55.040]  running away from the gunshots were black two people died and I think last time I
[3:23:55.040 --> 3:23:58.360]  checked there were actually more people injured than the 14 that the authorities
[3:23:58.360 --> 3:24:05.160]  initially said Chicago over the same weekend 67 people shot 13 dead two
[3:24:05.160 --> 3:24:10.720]  children dead in Chicago over that one weekend one of the victims was a 70
[3:24:10.720 --> 3:24:13.440]  year-old girl who was shot in the head while standing on the sidewalk at her
[3:24:13.440 --> 3:24:17.840]  grandmother's house Mayor Laurie Lightfoot came out in response to that
[3:24:17.840 --> 3:24:21.360]  and said tonight a 70 year-old girl in Austin joined a list of teenagers and
[3:24:21.360 --> 3:24:26.560]  children whose hopes and dreams were ended by the barrel of a gun so again
[3:24:26.560 --> 3:24:31.520]  where are the black lives matter marches over the deaths of these two innocent
[3:24:31.520 --> 3:24:36.280]  children that was a point made by one of the fathers of one of the children
[3:24:36.280 --> 3:24:40.160]  headline you killed a child father of eight-year-old shot during BLM protests
[3:24:40.160 --> 3:24:44.440]  speaks out the father of an eight-year-old girl who was shot during a
[3:24:44.440 --> 3:24:49.000]  black lives matter protest in Atlanta told BLM demonstrators quote you killed
[3:24:49.000 --> 3:24:54.520]  your own you killed a child he said they say black lives matter you killed your
[3:24:54.520 --> 3:24:58.280]  own they killed my baby because she crossed a barrier and made a u-turn you
[3:24:58.280 --> 3:25:03.880]  killed a child she didn't do nothing to nobody and again the mayor came out and
[3:25:03.880 --> 3:25:07.640]  echoed similar sentiments so you literally have the industrial level
[3:25:07.640 --> 3:25:12.440]  killings over one weekend of black people who both the victims and the
[3:25:12.440 --> 3:25:16.720]  perpetrators why is that not part of the conversation when it comes to black
[3:25:16.720 --> 3:25:21.240]  lives matter well of course because it can't be exploited for political gris
[3:25:21.240 --> 3:25:26.280]  and of course because the overarching agenda behind black lives matter is not
[3:25:26.280 --> 3:25:30.360]  fixing police brutality yes that is the agenda for a lot of well-meaning
[3:25:30.360 --> 3:25:34.440]  activists but if you look at the leadership if you look at their statements
[3:25:34.440 --> 3:25:38.800]  if you look at their websites it's about overthrowing capitalism defunding the
[3:25:38.800 --> 3:25:43.520]  police completely and eliminating the nuclear family they literally talk about
[3:25:43.520 --> 3:25:48.000]  this similar to the extinction rebellion protests which we had here in London a
[3:25:48.000 --> 3:25:53.080]  few months ago where if you went on their website their official website they
[3:25:53.080 --> 3:25:57.560]  said it wasn't they literally said it wasn't about climate change one of the
[3:25:57.560 --> 3:26:01.200]  leaders of extinction rebellion literally said this is not about climate
[3:26:01.200 --> 3:26:05.840]  change this is about overthrowing the western imperialist capitalist system
[3:26:05.840 --> 3:26:11.640]  and in fact he said it was about overthrowing quote heteronormativity so
[3:26:11.640 --> 3:26:16.960]  again it's all about intersectionality it's all about splicing in this lgbt
[3:26:16.960 --> 3:26:21.640]  movement which again is not a civil rights movement because gay people in
[3:26:21.640 --> 3:26:26.080]  the west have won all their rights they've won that battle it's about an
[3:26:26.080 --> 3:26:31.480]  ideological purge this is about an overarching agenda that's the point that
[3:26:31.480 --> 3:26:36.600]  Terry Cruz is trying to make during that CNN broadcast and of course Don Lemon
[3:26:36.600 --> 3:26:40.080]  because he's a grifter because he's part of the agenda that is trying to
[3:26:40.080 --> 3:26:45.000]  overthrow capitalism overthrow the west and indeed part of this coup against
[3:26:45.000 --> 3:26:49.840]  Donald Trump he's part of that neoliberal backlash which has manifested
[3:26:49.840 --> 3:26:55.200]  itself in the statue topplings in the black lives matter marches over the
[3:26:55.200 --> 3:27:00.560]  past five six weeks by the way another thing that's racist I talked about this
[3:27:00.560 --> 3:27:05.840]  at the top of the show we had a state agent descriptions of master bedrooms
[3:27:05.840 --> 3:27:12.400]  being racist now we had wasps being racist Shakespeare being racist roads in
[3:27:12.400 --> 3:27:17.240]  Wales which is 95% white demographically apparently they're racist and now
[3:27:17.240 --> 3:27:23.360]  maths is racist too headline out of some of news BLM teacher says two plus two
[3:27:23.360 --> 3:27:28.960]  only equals four because of quote Western imperialism yes she actually said
[3:27:28.960 --> 3:27:35.120]  this this was a teacher who apparently according to her own bio which includes
[3:27:35.120 --> 3:27:40.400]  her pronouns imagine my shot she's studying for a PhD at Rutgers and she
[3:27:40.400 --> 3:27:45.040]  is a teacher she put out a tweet which went viral after she claimed during the
[3:27:45.040 --> 3:27:48.920]  course of discussion about racism quote nope the idea of two plus two equaling
[3:27:48.920 --> 3:27:54.160]  four is cultural and because of Western imperialism colonization we think of it
[3:27:54.160 --> 3:27:59.600]  as the only way of knowing and we've seen this before where people say why are
[3:27:59.600 --> 3:28:05.280]  we using the quote Western math standard for mathematics why aren't we using
[3:28:05.280 --> 3:28:10.160]  other methods such as the way Aborigines count they literally make that argument
[3:28:10.160 --> 3:28:16.360]  and claim that that's because of Western imperialism yes really maybe it's because
[3:28:16.360 --> 3:28:19.360]  we're in the West and we're not Aborigines maybe that's why we use the
[3:28:19.360 --> 3:28:23.600]  Western system maybe that's the actual reason but as I wrote in this article
[3:28:23.600 --> 3:28:27.640]  and by the way she locked down her Twitter account and freaked out after
[3:28:27.640 --> 3:28:30.560]  this tweet came out and after people started picking up on it as they always
[3:28:30.560 --> 3:28:35.680]  do the bizarre statement is yet another example of intersectionality the pseudo
[3:28:35.680 --> 3:28:39.080]  intellectual garbage feminist notion which had been taught to all your kids
[3:28:39.080 --> 3:28:44.040]  right now by the way the racism and sexism are prevalent throughout all
[3:28:44.040 --> 3:28:49.200]  areas of society and are intertwined even down to the degree that describing a
[3:28:49.200 --> 3:28:55.160]  master bedroom as a master bedroom is a micro aggression and a form of cultural
[3:28:55.160 --> 3:29:03.600]  imperialism and racism it's really getting beyond a joke some good news now
[3:29:03.600 --> 3:29:10.080]  though 150 top intellectuals sign open letter decrying cancel culture 150 of
[3:29:10.080 --> 3:29:13.080]  the world's top intellectuals authors and activists have signed an open letter
[3:29:13.080 --> 3:29:16.760]  decrying leftist cancel culture censorship and the totalitarian March
[3:29:16.760 --> 3:29:22.640]  of co-ideological conformity now why they've only come out in July 2020 and
[3:29:22.640 --> 3:29:26.640]  said this now and why they're only putting out an open letter you know
[3:29:26.640 --> 3:29:29.600]  where are the conferences where are the marchers where's the big movement
[3:29:29.600 --> 3:29:33.080]  behind the few remaining actual liberals who are left who actually support and
[3:29:33.080 --> 3:29:39.320]  defend free speech kind of hiding isn't it to put it out in a letter but this
[3:29:39.320 --> 3:29:44.960]  was signed by Fareed Zakaria Gary Kasparov JK Rowling and even feminist
[3:29:44.960 --> 3:29:51.440]  activist Gloria Steinem as well as Noam Chomsky and Salman Rushdie and they
[3:29:51.440 --> 3:29:54.840]  write the democratic inclusion we want can be achieved only if we speak out
[3:29:54.840 --> 3:29:59.680]  against the intolerant climate that has set in on all sides they highlight how
[3:29:59.680 --> 3:30:03.560]  the free exchange of information and ideas the lifeblood of a liberal society
[3:30:03.560 --> 3:30:09.280]  is daily becoming more constricted and they then go on to talk about cancel
[3:30:09.280 --> 3:30:12.880]  culture we'll get more into after the break and also talk about the latest
[3:30:12.880 --> 3:30:17.680]  Epstein revelations summit.news don't go away

[3:31:42.320 --> 3:31:47.680]  19 is then added into the database as having a case that is counted as the
[3:31:47.680 --> 3:31:51.840]  case of COVID-19 it's in the NIH documents it's at the state level we

[3:35:43.640 --> 3:35:47.640]  glane Maxwell has dead woman switch secret sex tapes in her possession
[3:35:47.640 --> 3:35:52.440]  presumably so did Jeffrey Epstein didn't really help him did it glane Maxwell
[3:35:52.440 --> 3:35:56.760]  reportedly has secret sex tapes in her possession that would expose powerful
[3:35:56.760 --> 3:36:01.160]  Epstein acquaintances giving her clout in any potential plea deal while also
[3:36:01.160 --> 3:36:06.400]  acting as a form of protection against being suicided now this is according to
[3:36:06.400 --> 3:36:10.600]  an unnamed former friend of Maxwell's who told the Daily Mail quote if
[3:36:10.600 --> 3:36:14.080]  glane goes down she's going to take the whole damn lot of them with her
[3:36:14.080 --> 3:36:19.200]  ring Sandra maybe the secret stash of sex tapes I believe glane has scurled away
[3:36:19.200 --> 3:36:23.040]  could end up being her get out of jail card if the authorities are willing to
[3:36:23.040 --> 3:36:28.000]  trade said the insider he went on to say she has copies of everything Epstein
[3:36:28.000 --> 3:36:32.720]  had they could implicate some twisted movers and shakers now of course as I've
[3:36:32.720 --> 3:36:36.800]  explained before in fact I'm going to probably make a video about this this we
[3:36:36.800 --> 3:36:42.800]  can try and really flesh this all out we know that Epstein had his numerous
[3:36:42.800 --> 3:36:47.680]  mansions across the United States and of course little st. James his Caribbean
[3:36:47.680 --> 3:36:53.560]  island best tuned with secretly hidden video cameras everywhere so he could
[3:36:53.560 --> 3:36:58.480]  record his influential friends having sex with underage girls material that
[3:36:58.480 --> 3:37:02.120]  could later be used to blackmail them because of course what the Netflix
[3:37:02.120 --> 3:37:06.720]  documentary didn't tell you which is kind of a central core aspect to this
[3:37:06.720 --> 3:37:12.600]  whole scandal is that Epstein was almost certainly part of a compromise
[3:37:12.600 --> 3:37:17.400]  intelligence program run by Mossad of course we had the exes right Israeli
[3:37:17.400 --> 3:37:23.080]  spy come out months ago now and best up to the fact that Epstein was recruited
[3:37:23.080 --> 3:37:28.760]  by the Israeli Mossad to spy on to collect blackmail on all these powerful
[3:37:28.760 --> 3:37:34.680]  figures via Gillian's father Robert Maxwell who was also almost certainly a
[3:37:34.680 --> 3:37:39.600]  triple agent as I document in this article when authorities raided Epstein's
[3:37:39.600 --> 3:37:42.840]  New York home last year they found found a vast trove of pornographic
[3:37:42.840 --> 3:37:47.520]  photographs and digital video files of underage girls and they all had hand
[3:37:47.520 --> 3:37:53.000]  written descriptions of both the victim the description of the material and the
[3:37:53.000 --> 3:37:58.160]  name of the individual abusing them so all these individuals were tied to these
[3:37:58.160 --> 3:38:04.600]  digital copies of videos of this child sex abuse given that Epstein committed
[3:38:04.600 --> 3:38:07.640]  to his side less than a month after reports indicated he was ready to name
[3:38:07.640 --> 3:38:11.880]  powerful players in an effort to secure himself a reduced sentence it wouldn't
[3:38:11.880 --> 3:38:15.680]  be a shock to learn that Maxwell was thinking along the same lines but again
[3:38:15.680 --> 3:38:21.760]  didn't really work out for Jeff we did it in fact we had an article which I
[3:38:21.760 --> 3:38:26.120]  linked to I think in this article or one of the previous ones where there were
[3:38:26.120 --> 3:38:29.320]  rumors and it was being widely reported that Epstein was trying to get reduced
[3:38:29.320 --> 3:38:35.280]  plea deal a reduced sentence if he named the other complicit parties in his sex
[3:38:35.280 --> 3:38:40.760]  trafficking empire three weeks later he was dead what a surprise but as we
[3:38:40.760 --> 3:38:43.680]  highlighted last week a lawyer for one of Epstein's accusers thinks that
[3:38:43.680 --> 3:38:47.600]  Ghislaine Maxwell could reveal a quote bigger name involved in Epstein's
[3:38:47.600 --> 3:38:53.160]  pedophile network in order to secure a plea deal following her arrest that was
[3:38:53.160 --> 3:38:56.800]  Lisa Bloom who said I'm sure Ghislaine's attorneys will try to make a deal where
[3:38:56.800 --> 3:39:00.440]  she speaks out about a bigger name to get reduced charges for herself well good
[3:39:00.440 --> 3:39:07.160]  luck with that because it didn't turn out too great for Jeffrey did it now the
[3:39:07.160 --> 3:39:11.680]  question of where Epstein's money came from and where it was being sent has
[3:39:11.680 --> 3:39:16.160]  been lingering for well over a year we have this headline out of zero hedge
[3:39:16.160 --> 3:39:21.880]  Deutsche Bank inexcusably failed to monitor Jeffrey Epstein's accounts find
[3:39:21.880 --> 3:39:27.200]  a hundred and fifty million dollars well I wonder why they mysteriously failed to
[3:39:27.200 --> 3:39:30.560]  monitor his accounts could it be because they were complicit because some of the
[3:39:30.560 --> 3:39:35.080]  people within Deutsche Bank were complicit and indeed being blackmailed by
[3:39:35.080 --> 3:39:39.160]  Epstein just putting it out there but now the New York State Department of
[3:39:39.160 --> 3:39:44.360]  Financial Services released a statement today indicating Deutsche Bank has been
[3:39:44.360 --> 3:39:47.200]  fined a hundred and fifty million dollars for banking transactions with
[3:39:47.200 --> 3:39:52.800]  the Q-sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein who is now dead NYDFS said Deutsche Bank
[3:39:52.800 --> 3:39:56.840]  agreed to the multi-million dollar penalty for quote failing to properly
[3:39:56.840 --> 3:40:03.560]  monitor account activity conducted on behalf of Epstein as banking regulators
[3:40:03.560 --> 3:40:06.040]  have been investigating Epstein's dealings with the bank for months
[3:40:06.040 --> 3:40:10.120]  including past lending and transactions along with dozens of accounts linked to
[3:40:10.120 --> 3:40:15.000]  him shortly before he died the investigation focused on why the
[3:40:15.000 --> 3:40:19.480]  bank continued to do business with Epstein despite internal concerns that
[3:40:19.480 --> 3:40:23.920]  were raised so they knew from within the bank where this money was going but they
[3:40:23.920 --> 3:40:29.880]  just turned a blind eye much like the jailguards in Epstein's cell both
[3:40:29.880 --> 3:40:35.720]  mysteriously just fell asleep and allowed him to commit suicide and NYDFS said
[3:40:35.720 --> 3:40:39.760]  the payments from Epstein's Deutsche Bank accounts were made to his co-conspirators
[3:40:39.760 --> 3:40:44.160]  who sexually abused women so that's where the money was going other payments
[3:40:44.160 --> 3:40:48.800]  were made to Russian models payment for women's school tuition which of course
[3:40:48.800 --> 3:40:53.720]  again was him buying off the victim's family the release attempting to hotel
[3:40:53.720 --> 3:40:58.800]  and rent expenses and consistent with allegations of prior wrongdoing payments
[3:40:58.800 --> 3:41:05.160]  directly the numerous women with Eastern European surnames they noted Epstein's
[3:41:05.160 --> 3:41:09.640]  periodic suspicious cash withdrawal withdrawals which totaled more than
[3:41:09.640 --> 3:41:16.280]  eight hundred thousand dollars over just four years so Deutsche Bank was Epstein's
[3:41:16.280 --> 3:41:20.760]  lender from 2013 even as other financial institutions labeled him a red flag of
[3:41:20.760 --> 3:41:27.800]  course he was convicted of soliciting a minor five years before that in 2008 but
[3:41:27.800 --> 3:41:31.840]  Deutsche Bank continued to handle his money while he was being sent all around
[3:41:31.840 --> 3:41:35.080]  the world to these different people who were complicit in his sex trafficking and
[3:41:35.080 --> 3:41:42.320]  no one said a word incredible almost as if they were in on it meanwhile former
[3:41:42.320 --> 3:41:48.320]  Reddit CEO Ellen Powell chairman power she used to call admits we knew about
[3:41:48.320 --> 3:41:52.840]  Gillay Maxwell sex trafficking underage girls she admitted in a tweet before
[3:41:52.840 --> 3:41:57.040]  locking down her account once again as they always do quote we knew about
[3:41:57.040 --> 3:42:01.000]  Gillay Maxwell sex trafficking underage girls but attended a party where Maxwell
[3:42:01.000 --> 3:42:08.000]  was present anyway now we had Elon Musk embroiled in this a media witch hunt
[3:42:08.000 --> 3:42:13.560]  against Elon Musk over the past few days because he was pictured with Maxwell at
[3:42:13.560 --> 3:42:19.440]  one of these tech elite parties back in I think it was 2014 because we know the
[3:42:19.440 --> 3:42:23.560]  years and years Epstein was transfixed obsessed with ingratiating himself
[3:42:23.560 --> 3:42:29.120]  amongst the tech elite notably Bill Gates who again continued to have a very
[3:42:29.120 --> 3:42:34.720]  close relationship with Jeffrey Epstein long after his 2008 conviction of sex
[3:42:34.720 --> 3:42:40.640]  trafficking a minor well apparently Ellen Powell knew about the underage
[3:42:40.640 --> 3:42:46.320]  trafficking too but just went to the party anyway now you can trust that with
[3:42:46.320 --> 3:42:51.200]  a treatment of Elon Musk why no for a fact didn't even know who Epstein was
[3:42:51.200 --> 3:42:57.120]  he was pictured with Maxwell at this party famous person in meets other famous
[3:42:57.120 --> 3:43:00.600]  person shocker and that's the point about this whole network some of the
[3:43:00.600 --> 3:43:04.800]  people on Epstein's black book list on the people pictured with Epstein and
[3:43:04.800 --> 3:43:09.520]  Maxwell were intimately involved in his sex trafficking were part of it some of
[3:43:09.520 --> 3:43:13.200]  them weren't some of them were just pictured with them because it's known
[3:43:13.200 --> 3:43:19.440]  that Epstein tried to coax people from the tech elite from the political elite
[3:43:19.440 --> 3:43:24.280]  into his inner circle so he could blackmail them by throwing young girls
[3:43:24.280 --> 3:43:28.080]  at them now many of these those people who he attempted to pull that blackmail
[3:43:28.080 --> 3:43:32.760]  stunt on refused to go along with it or just ignored him all together so yeah
[3:43:32.760 --> 3:43:37.280]  you're gonna have people who were in Epstein's black book who are pictured
[3:43:37.280 --> 3:43:42.280]  with him or Maxwell at these society parties who were not involved in the
[3:43:42.280 --> 3:43:46.800]  sex trafficking now when it gets to the level of being on the light list for the
[3:43:46.800 --> 3:43:50.360]  liter Express maybe that's a different story but there are a lot of people who
[3:43:50.360 --> 3:43:55.040]  are embroiled in this Epstein scandal unfairly and that's who the media
[3:43:55.040 --> 3:43:59.680]  focuses on that's who they go after on Twitter in these witch hunts which we've
[3:43:59.680 --> 3:44:04.440]  seen against Elon Musk in the past few days but funnily enough the the
[3:44:04.440 --> 3:44:08.960]  entertainers the Kevin Spaces of the world who were listed in Epstein's
[3:44:08.960 --> 3:44:13.200]  black book who are potentially implicated and are left-wing in their
[3:44:13.200 --> 3:44:17.520]  politics are surprisingly left alone and nobody's really concerned about their
[3:44:17.520 --> 3:44:22.480]  involvement interesting that isn't it? Meanwhile Royal Society president says
[3:44:22.480 --> 3:44:26.440]  Musk refused Nick should be publicly shamed like drunk drivers this mask
[3:44:26.440 --> 3:44:30.400]  wearing has now become part of the culture war it's become a symbol of
[3:44:30.400 --> 3:44:34.440]  obedience it's beginning to become a symbol of supporting the lockdown which
[3:44:34.440 --> 3:44:38.160]  of course has become completely politicized in both the US and the UK
[3:44:38.160 --> 3:44:42.800]  so now the president of the Royal Society which of course is a big elitist
[3:44:42.800 --> 3:44:46.680]  confab says that people who refuse to wear masks and he's calling for them to
[3:44:46.680 --> 3:44:50.840]  be made to wear masks inside public buildings should be publicly shamed
[3:44:50.840 --> 3:44:55.200]  like drunk drivers this is the reemergence of this attempt to publicly
[3:44:55.200 --> 3:45:00.600]  shame and indeed cancel people who refuse to wear the mask of obedience when it
[3:45:00.600 --> 3:45:04.080]  comes to coronavirus that's gonna wrap up wrap up the show warring with our
[3:45:04.080 --> 3:45:19.200]  instructor coming up next summit.news go on
