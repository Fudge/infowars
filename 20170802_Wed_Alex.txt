[00:00:01.587 --> 00:00:09.992]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:09.992 --> 00:00:12.673]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:12.673 --> 00:00:18.657]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:18.657 --> 00:00:26.341]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:00:27.543 --> 00:00:38.469]  Cy Hirsch, two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, a man credited more than anybody of ending the Vietnam War, even more so than Walter Cronkite or Mr. Ellsberg.
[00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:43.812]  Cy Hirsch, two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, has come out
[00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:54.457]  In a shock bombshell interview that's on Infowars.com, there's a total blackout on this news, and said he talked directly to intelligence sources.
[00:00:54.457 --> 00:01:03.324]  We know one of them was the British ambassador, as well as folks at the highest levels of US intel, that Seth Rich was the leaker.
[00:01:03.324 --> 00:01:04.885]  It was not a Russian hack.
[00:01:05.706 --> 00:01:07.147]  That's Cy Hirsch.
[00:01:07.147 --> 00:01:09.449]  There's a total blackout on this news.
[00:01:09.449 --> 00:01:12.491]  We're going to break it in the next segment.
[00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:13.871]  This is huge.
[00:01:13.871 --> 00:01:20.095]  Meanwhile, Google, YouTube and others have launched massive censorship that started two days ago.
[00:01:20.095 --> 00:01:26.139]  Google and YouTube have banned a professor who refused to use gender-neutral pronouns in Canada.
[00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:27.020]  It's happening.
[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.241]  Here's Paul Watson reporting.
[00:01:28.809 --> 00:01:33.772]  YouTube says it will fight extremist content by censoring controversial videos.
[00:01:33.772 --> 00:01:36.814]  Who are they teaming up with to oversee this new program?
[00:01:36.814 --> 00:01:40.776]  Must be someone non-partisan, trustworthy, credible.
[00:01:40.776 --> 00:01:46.580]  A group that clearly knows the difference between free speech and violent hate speech, right?
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.682]  It's the Anti-Defamation League, the ADL.
[00:01:49.682 --> 00:01:49.762]  Oh!
[00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:51.821]  But wait!
[00:01:51.821 --> 00:01:56.303]  I mean, surely YouTube wouldn't just hand power to those who would easily abuse it?
[00:01:56.303 --> 00:01:58.103]  This is a serious organization.
[00:01:58.103 --> 00:02:01.805]  The ADL's bar for hate speech must be pretty high, right?
[00:02:01.805 --> 00:02:02.545]  I mean, what is it?
[00:02:02.545 --> 00:02:03.965]  Advocating for genocide?
[00:02:03.965 --> 00:02:05.866]  Calling for violence against Jews?
[00:02:05.866 --> 00:02:08.807]  Oh, they literally think a cartoon frog is hate speech!
[00:02:09.187 --> 00:02:10.649]  That's how low the bar is.
[00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:21.680]  The ADL put the grandson of a survivor of the Nazi occupation on a list alongside actual neo-Nazis and white supremacists, simply because he's a conservative.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.385]  They also listed a bunch of other conservatives next to actual neo-Nazis.
[00:02:26.385 --> 00:02:32.411]  Oh, but they're the impartial, rational, neutral outfit that's now going to thought police YouTube.
[00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:34.232]  They're not partisan at all!
[00:02:34.232 --> 00:02:46.662]  So a group whose entire existence and millions of dollars in funding every year relies on fanning hysteria over hate speech is now being given the power by YouTube to patrol hate speech!
[00:02:46.662 --> 00:02:49.264]  Gee, what could possibly go wrong?
[00:02:49.264 --> 00:02:52.086]  Who else is working with YouTube to patrol hate speech?
[00:02:52.086 --> 00:02:58.631]  The Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a group that runs a program on far-right extremism in coordination with
[00:02:59.091 --> 00:03:00.312]  The Swedish government.
[00:03:00.312 --> 00:03:08.857]  Oh, you mean the same Swedish government that put 14,000 people, most of them conservative commentators, on a Twitter hate speech block list.
[00:03:08.857 --> 00:03:17.422]  The same Swedish government that put PewDiePie, a dude whose content consists mostly of him playing video games, on that same hate speech block list.
[00:03:17.422 --> 00:03:22.926]  A government that thinks posting factual statistics about the link between migrants and violent crime
[00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:24.746]  Is an act of hate speech?
[00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:27.147]  What could possibly go wrong?
[00:03:27.147 --> 00:03:31.048]  Who else gets to decide what is and isn't hate speech on YouTube?
[00:03:31.048 --> 00:03:36.910]  The No Hate Speech Movement, a group that says websites that criticize Islam are hate speech.
[00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.832]  A group that says the President of the United States should be banned from Twitter for hate speech.
[00:03:43.012 --> 00:03:45.534]  Yeah, that bar still seems pretty low, doesn't it?
[00:03:45.534 --> 00:03:49.916]  But hey, I guess YouTube are just following the example of Twitter and Facebook.
[00:03:49.916 --> 00:03:58.141]  When Twitter wanted to crack down on abuse and harassment, they teamed up with feminists who think telling them they suck is abuse and harassment.
[00:03:58.141 --> 00:03:59.522]  Everything is sexist.
[00:03:59.522 --> 00:04:00.662]  Everything is racist.
[00:04:00.662 --> 00:04:01.623]  Everything is homophobic.
[00:04:01.943 --> 00:04:04.746]  Facebook wanted to crack down on fake news.
[00:04:04.746 --> 00:04:13.995]  They teamed up with Snopes, a credible, independent outlet that isn't left of Stalin and doesn't embezzle money to spend on luxury vacations and prostitutes.
[00:04:13.995 --> 00:04:19.000]  Oh, but don't worry, because YouTube says they're not going to censor controversial videos.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.624]  They're just going to hide them, make sure they can't appear in the recommended bar.
[00:04:22.864 --> 00:04:24.565]  Be liked or commented on.
[00:04:24.565 --> 00:04:26.386]  But they're not censoring them, honest.
[00:04:26.386 --> 00:04:27.246]  Let's get real.
[00:04:27.246 --> 00:04:31.808]  In the context of politics, the right has completely taken over YouTube.
[00:04:31.808 --> 00:04:34.310]  Even Vice.com had to admit it.
[00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.751]  The adpocalypse was only the beginning.
[00:04:36.751 --> 00:04:42.594]  Unless we bitch and moan about this over and over again, this is the start of the purge.
[00:04:42.594 --> 00:04:46.035]  And even if you're not a conservative, you should still be alarmed.
[00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:47.656]  They're going after anyone.
[00:04:47.776 --> 00:04:49.897]  Who isn't advertiser friendly?
[00:04:49.897 --> 00:04:57.479]  Which is basically anyone outside the limits of the narrow consensus of opinion that they subjectively define.
[00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.840]  Maybe we have allies within the company that can put a stop to this.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.941]  But unless we fight back, this is the beginning of the end.
[00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:12.788]  Prepping for disaster and societal unrest has now gone so mainstream that even Realtor.com is writing about it.
[00:05:12.788 --> 00:05:22.037]  But the Realtors are still embarrassed to cover the subject and eager to set themselves apart from what they call Uncle Travis' guns and canned foods militia vision of preparedness.
[00:05:22.037 --> 00:05:24.380]  Well, the ants may have the last laugh
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.781]  On the grasshoppers.
[00:05:25.781 --> 00:05:29.002]  But the grasshoppers will still sing the tune, if they can make money.
[00:05:29.002 --> 00:05:35.705]  But maybe you don't have a Hollywood mansion, where you can drop another million dollars to turn your home theater into a radiation-proof bunker.
[00:05:35.705 --> 00:05:40.166]  There are still very effective, low-tech, low-cost things you can do to prepare.
[00:05:40.166 --> 00:05:47.969]  In fact, even realizing that there's a need to prepare, and doing anything to act on that realization, increases your chances of survival.
[00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:54.032]  Things that you do to prepare for an Armageddon scenario will help you to weather storms, to absorb an economic shock,
[00:05:54.252 --> 00:06:05.378]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:06:17.065 --> 00:06:19.128]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[00:06:19.128 --> 00:06:21.992]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[00:06:21.992 --> 00:06:23.474]  It's made in the USA.
[00:06:23.474 --> 00:06:30.303]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:06:30.303 --> 00:06:31.565]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[00:06:32.386 --> 00:06:42.094]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:06:42.094 --> 00:06:58.907]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:06:58.907 --> 00:07:02.070]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.311]  Now it's time to change our bodies with a Z-Shield at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:06.311 --> 00:07:10.311]  A new shipment of Bio-True Selenium is now available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:10.311 --> 00:07:11.792]  We've been sold out for months.
[00:07:11.792 --> 00:07:16.853]  Our one-of-a-kind Infowarslife Bio-True Selenium formula is now back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:21.013]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[00:07:21.013 --> 00:07:25.534]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.
[00:07:25.534 --> 00:07:28.735]  But Bio-True Selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[00:07:30.675 --> 00:07:34.138]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[00:07:34.138 --> 00:07:46.387]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight, BioTrue Selenium is also the perfect supercharger to survival shield X2 nascent iodine, as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[00:07:46.387 --> 00:07:51.291]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to order your bottle of BioTrue Selenium before we sell it again.
[00:07:51.291 --> 00:07:52.352]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[00:07:53.032 --> 00:07:54.732]  Thank God you just joined us and didn't know it!
[00:07:54.732 --> 00:07:56.413]  The Second Amendment is for a grand government!
[00:08:20.094 --> 00:08:24.280]  That is, your father is right!
[00:08:34.269 --> 00:08:36.532]  You won't stand up against me or you'll only be a slave.
[00:08:36.532 --> 00:08:41.217]  If you're sad and lonely, they will push you around and make you their slave.
[00:08:41.217 --> 00:08:42.137]  Because do it again!
[00:08:42.137 --> 00:08:43.399]  Because win it again!
[00:08:43.399 --> 00:08:44.520]  Stand up!
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.522]  And tell the New World Order!
[00:08:46.522 --> 00:08:50.587]  You can take our lives, but you'll never take our freedom!
[00:08:50.587 --> 00:08:51.988]  What we are looking at is good shit.
[00:08:53.129 --> 00:08:59.474]  For the people above you that are inviting you into their New World Order, they're slaves.
[00:08:59.474 --> 00:09:00.594]  They've sold out to it.
[00:09:00.594 --> 00:09:01.955]  They're blind.
[00:09:01.955 --> 00:09:03.056]  They're cowards.
[00:09:03.056 --> 00:09:04.257]  You don't want to be part of them.
[00:09:04.257 --> 00:09:06.699]  Like Patrick Henry said, forget you are our brethren.
[00:09:06.699 --> 00:09:08.540]  Go from us in peace.
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.322]  Crouch down and lift the hand that feeds you.
[00:09:11.322 --> 00:09:15.025]  Let your chains sit lightly upon you.
[00:09:15.025 --> 00:09:18.728]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[00:09:26.451 --> 00:09:37.800]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:48.067]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on the second day of August 2017 on this Wednesday Worldwide Global Transmission.
[00:09:48.067 --> 00:09:55.553]  First off, out of the gates, two-time Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Cy Hirsch has already written
[00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.830]  Months ago that he talked to U.S.
[00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:05.372]  intelligence and a top British ambassador who have actually met with high-level U.S.
[00:10:05.372 --> 00:10:13.013]  intelligence officers as well that have confirmed that Seth Rich was the leaker to WikiLeaks.
[00:10:13.013 --> 00:10:21.075]  We have Julian Assange publicly, within a week of Seth Rich being gunned down, shot in the back.
[00:10:21.966 --> 00:10:32.069]  Saying that they don't ever give up sources but that basically Seth Rich was their source and it should be investigated along those lines.
[00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:44.173]  We now have intel coming out that you have these Islamic brothers from Pakistan in control of Democratic Party servers and that Seth Rich was reportedly that night at a party with them.
[00:10:44.173 --> 00:10:49.075]  You have Debbie Wasserman Schultz threatening the DC police that she is over
[00:10:49.986 --> 00:10:55.272]  As a representative of that area, saying, I'll cut your funding if you don't give back their laptops.
[00:10:55.272 --> 00:11:00.218]  And then you have them in the news saying, don't ever question Seth Rich's murder.
[00:11:00.218 --> 00:11:04.243]  Don't look at it or we'll basically have somebody sue you.
[00:11:04.243 --> 00:11:07.586]  Well, this is Cy Hirsch, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:07.586 --> 00:11:09.048]  The article's on InfoWars.com.
[00:11:12.329 --> 00:11:25.719]  The video and audio is on Infowars.com, and there is a total MSM blackout on two-time Pulitzer Prize winning author, who also exposed that ISIS and Al Qaeda were being run by Obama.
[00:11:25.719 --> 00:11:27.520]  By the way, he's a liberal.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.722]  A classical liberal.
[00:11:30.722 --> 00:11:32.524]  But he has a conscience.
[00:11:32.524 --> 00:11:37.047]  He's credited with ending the Vietnam War with his stories on the My Lai Massacre, you name it.
[00:11:38.507 --> 00:11:44.152]  The guy that spurred Walter Cronkite to say the war was unwinnable because it wasn't meant to be won.
[00:11:44.152 --> 00:11:49.576]  Media completely ignores bombshell Seymour Hersh revelations on Seth Ridge.
[00:11:49.576 --> 00:11:54.039]  Not a single MSM outlet has covered the story.
[00:11:54.039 --> 00:11:59.163]  The audio tape obtained by Big League Politics, Hersh says he saw an FBI report linked
[00:12:00.171 --> 00:12:09.499]  Leaked to him by an insider which confirms that Rich had contacted Wikileaks with sample emails from DNC Leaker and asked for payment for the full data dump.
[00:12:09.499 --> 00:12:11.501]  And it goes on from there.
[00:12:11.501 --> 00:12:14.784]  And he has multiple ambassadors telling him the same thing.
[00:12:14.784 --> 00:12:18.387]  One of these ambassadors has gone public to say he met with U.S.
[00:12:18.387 --> 00:12:26.854]  intelligence and they showed him the files that Rich was reportedly out there trying to sell the data.
[00:12:26.854 --> 00:12:27.815]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:12:29.633 --> 00:12:37.880]  Well they don't want you to hear it, we've had to bleep it, but this is the candid recording of Cy Hirsch.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.022]  Here is that report.
[00:12:40.022 --> 00:12:50.310]  But he's got access, and before he was killed.
[00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:55.014]  About the kid, I'll tell you what I know.
[00:12:55.677 --> 00:12:57.457]  Well, I know it comes off an FBI report.
[00:12:57.457 --> 00:12:58.158]  Don't ask me how.
[00:12:58.158 --> 00:12:58.798]  You can figure out.
[00:12:58.798 --> 00:13:01.238]  I've been around long enough.
[00:13:01.238 --> 00:13:03.239]  The kid gets... I don't think he was murdered.
[00:13:03.239 --> 00:13:05.359]  I don't think he was murdered because of what he knew.
[00:13:05.359 --> 00:13:07.519]  The kid's a nice boy, 27.
[00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:09.620]  He was not an IT expert, but he learned stuff.
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.500]  He was a data programmer, but he learned stuff.
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.861]  And so he's living on one street.
[00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:17.821]  He's living in a very rough neighborhood.
[00:13:17.821 --> 00:13:22.042]  And in the exact area where he lived, there have been about 10... I'm sure you know this.
[00:13:22.042 --> 00:13:25.363]  There have been about 8 or 9 or 10 violent robberies.
[00:13:25.951 --> 00:13:28.554]  Most of them with somebody brandishing a gun.
[00:13:28.554 --> 00:13:31.697]  And if they hit his hand, I'm telling you, I'm sure you know, his hands were marked up.
[00:13:31.697 --> 00:13:37.702]  The cops concluded he fought off the people, tried to run and they shot him twice in the back with a .22, small caliber.
[00:13:37.702 --> 00:13:40.725]  And then the kids that did it ran, they got scared, didn't take his wallet.
[00:13:40.725 --> 00:13:41.226]  Okay.
[00:13:41.226 --> 00:13:45.930]  So what the cops do then, and here's what nobody knows, but I'm telling you, maybe you know something about it.
[00:13:46.564 --> 00:13:56.293]  When you have a death like that, DC cops, if you're dead, you generally don't just go, you have to kind of, what's going on, you have to get to the kid's apartment and see what you can find.
[00:13:56.293 --> 00:14:02.759]  If he's dead, you don't need a warrant, but most cops get a warrant because they don't know if the guy has a roommate.
[00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:03.480]  You need a warrant.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.701]  So they get a warrant.
[00:14:04.701 --> 00:14:06.903]  I'm just telling you, there is such a thing.
[00:14:06.903 --> 00:14:10.867]  They go in the house and they can't do much with his computer, his password, the cops don't know much about it.
[00:14:12.447 --> 00:14:15.149]  They have a cyber unit in DC and they're more sophisticated.
[00:14:15.149 --> 00:14:16.050]  They come and look at it.
[00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:24.919]  The idea is maybe you've had a series of exchanges with somebody who says, I'm going to kill you over a girl and they can't get in.
[00:14:24.919 --> 00:14:27.401]  The cyber guys do a little better, but they can't make sense of it.
[00:14:27.401 --> 00:14:31.805]  So they call the, they call the FBI cyber unit at DC.
[00:14:31.805 --> 00:14:35.289]  The DC unit, the Washington field office is a hot unit.
[00:14:36.058 --> 00:14:41.660]  The guy running the Washington field office, he's like, he's like, you know, he's like a three-star at an Army base.
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:42.721]  He's ready looking for four.
[00:14:42.721 --> 00:14:43.701]  You know what I mean?
[00:14:43.701 --> 00:14:45.482]  He's going to go into a top job.
[00:14:45.482 --> 00:14:48.843]  There's a cyber unit there that's excellent.
[00:14:48.843 --> 00:15:02.989]  What you get in a warrant, the public information you get in a warrant doesn't include, it does not include the affidavit underlying why you're going in, what the reasons are.
[00:15:02.989 --> 00:15:04.490]  That's almost never available.
[00:15:06.341 --> 00:15:07.261]  I can tell you that.
[00:15:07.261 --> 00:15:11.463]  The existence of a warrant is a public document 99% of the time.
[00:15:11.463 --> 00:15:15.525]  So, they, on the same warrant, they call in the Fed.
[00:15:15.525 --> 00:15:18.106]  The Feds get through, and here's what they find.
[00:15:18.106 --> 00:15:21.047]  This is according to the FBI report.
[00:15:21.047 --> 00:15:27.530]  What they find is, he makes, first of all, you have to know, you have to know some basic facts.
[00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:33.353]  One of the basic facts is that there's no DNC or Podesta email that exists beyond May 22nd.
[00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:54.232]  And so this, so what the report says, that sometime in late spring, we're talking about June, you know, summer's in June 21st, late spring would be after, I presume, I don't know, I just hear it says late spring, early summer.
[00:15:54.232 --> 00:15:57.294]  He makes contact with WikiLeaks.
[00:15:57.294 --> 00:15:59.795]  That's in his computer, and he makes contact.
[00:15:59.795 --> 00:16:03.737]  Now, I have to be careful because I don't
[00:16:08.134 --> 00:16:08.895]  We're good to go.
[00:16:36.584 --> 00:16:37.164]  Was it a hack?
[00:16:37.164 --> 00:16:42.946]  It wasn't a hack, but whatever happened, the Democrats themselves wrote this s**t, you know what I mean?
[00:16:42.946 --> 00:16:54.449]  All I know is that he offered a sample, an extensive sample, you know, I'm sure dozens of emails, and said, I want money.
[00:16:54.449 --> 00:16:57.490]  That later, WikiLeaks did get the password.
[00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.971]  He had a dropbox, a protective dropbox, which isn't hard to do.
[00:17:01.701 --> 00:17:02.882]  I mean, you don't have to be a wizard.
[00:17:02.882 --> 00:17:03.782]  I cheated with him.
[00:17:03.782 --> 00:17:06.463]  He was certainly not a dumb kid.
[00:17:06.463 --> 00:17:08.104]  They got access to the Dropbox.
[00:17:08.104 --> 00:17:13.606]  He also, this is also in the FBI report, he also let people know with whom he was dealing.
[00:17:13.606 --> 00:17:14.867]  I don't know how he dealt.
[00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:17.308]  I'll tell you about WikiLeaks in a second.
[00:17:17.308 --> 00:17:22.250]  I don't know how he dealt with the WikiLeaks mechanism.
[00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:28.173]  But he also, the word was passed, according to the FBI report, I also shared this box with a couple of friends.
[00:17:29.016 --> 00:17:32.298]  So if anything happens to me, it's not going to solve your problem.
[00:17:32.298 --> 00:17:33.479]  Okay?
[00:17:33.479 --> 00:17:34.680]  I don't know what that means.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:38.302]  I don't know whether he was... Anyway, but Whitney Leaks got exited.
[00:17:38.302 --> 00:17:43.005]  And before he was killed, I can tell you right now, Brennan's an a**hole.
[00:17:43.005 --> 00:17:44.466]  I've known all these people for years.
[00:17:44.466 --> 00:17:47.088]  Klepper's sort of a better guy, but not rocket scientist.
[00:17:47.088 --> 00:17:48.649]  The NSA guy's a f***ing moron.
[00:17:49.372 --> 00:17:49.892]  I have somebody
[00:18:13.957 --> 00:18:15.478]  I have somebody on the inside.
[00:18:15.478 --> 00:18:17.420]  You know, I've been around a long time and I write a lot of stuff.
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:21.363]  I have somebody inside who will go and read a file for me.
[00:18:21.363 --> 00:18:23.884]  This person is unbelievably accurate and careful.
[00:18:23.884 --> 00:18:25.425]  He's a very high-level guy.
[00:18:25.425 --> 00:18:26.406]  He'll do a favor.
[00:18:26.406 --> 00:18:29.869]  You're just going to have to trust me.
[00:18:29.869 --> 00:18:33.852]  I have what they call in my business long-form criminalism.
[00:18:33.852 --> 00:18:36.934]  I have a narrative of how that whole thing began.
[00:18:36.934 --> 00:18:38.835]  It's a Brennan operation.
[00:18:38.835 --> 00:18:41.157]  It was an American disinformation and
[00:18:42.079 --> 00:18:57.670]  The President, at one point, when they even started telling the press, they were back-briefing the press, the head of the NSA was going and telling the press, Rogers, was telling the press that we even know who in the G.I.U., the Russian Military Intelligence Service, leads it.
[00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:07.537]  I mean, all bulls**t. They were telling these two... I worked with the New York Times for f**king years, and some of the f**king New York Times, that they have smart guys, but they're totally beholden on sources.
[00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:10.631]  If the president or the head of the C.H.L.
[00:19:10.631 --> 00:19:12.752]  tells them something, they actually believe it.
[00:19:12.752 --> 00:19:19.095]  I was hired at the Times to write about the Gouache's war, the Vietnam War in 72, because they were just locked in.
[00:19:19.095 --> 00:19:20.336]  So that's what the Times is.
[00:19:20.336 --> 00:19:22.657]  These guys run the Times.
[00:19:22.657 --> 00:19:24.178]  And Trump's not wrong.
[00:19:24.178 --> 00:19:27.359]  I mean, I wish he would calm down and have been a press secretary.
[00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:39.634]  There's Cy Hirsch, the greatest living journalist, and he likes Trump, just like the Pauls like Trump.
[00:19:39.634 --> 00:19:43.376]  Any real intellectual, like Julian Assange, likes Trump.
[00:19:43.376 --> 00:19:49.400]  Anybody who's smart, anybody who has the facts, cannot believe how good he is.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.682]  He's so real, though, he's wild.
[00:19:52.682 --> 00:19:53.062]  It's true.
[00:19:53.062 --> 00:19:58.706]  I mean, he is the President of the United States, and he is on the deck, and he is in charge.
[00:19:58.706 --> 00:19:59.867]  And the elite are scared.
[00:20:00.768 --> 00:20:03.734]  Because they don't know what he's going to do to them because they're such criminals.
[00:20:03.734 --> 00:20:04.455]  We'll be back.
[00:20:04.455 --> 00:20:05.517]  That was Bombshell Info.
[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:07.600]  Maybe not today.

[00:24:39.162 --> 00:24:40.703]  Seymour Hersh.
[00:24:40.703 --> 00:24:43.064]  Two-time Pulitzer Prize winner.

[00:24:49.127 --> 00:24:50.148]  Totally documented.
[00:24:50.808 --> 00:24:54.449]  Coming out in a new report saying he talked to high-level U.S.
[00:24:54.449 --> 00:24:56.969]  government officials, ambassadors, you name it.
[00:24:56.969 --> 00:24:59.150]  They were watching Seth Rich.
[00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:02.010]  They were trying to get into the DNC systems.
[00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:03.991]  The DNC hadn't let them in.
[00:25:03.991 --> 00:25:05.511]  They knew it was being penetrated.
[00:25:05.511 --> 00:25:10.352]  They were watching Seth Rich, trying to sell the data to WikiLeaks.
[00:25:10.352 --> 00:25:13.333]  And you have WikiLeaks saying, right after he got shot in the back,
[00:25:14.033 --> 00:25:15.834]  That yes, he was their source.
[00:25:15.834 --> 00:25:20.015]  Now we have Sy Hersh confirming all of it.
[00:25:20.015 --> 00:25:30.018]  We have the identity of the DNC leaker, and it's not a Russian, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:30.018 --> 00:25:37.640]  Here is Julian Assange from right after it happened, saying, I investigated both presidential candidates and only Clinton has ties to Russia.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.020]  And then,
[00:25:39.076 --> 00:25:44.500]  You actually look at who did the uranium deal, who got the $100 million for the bank deal, who met with Putin in secret.
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:57.329]  Who had Mueller take illegal uranium samples to a tarmac to meet with the Russians in Europe for the Clintons?
[00:25:57.329 --> 00:25:59.771]  Who can make this up?
[00:26:01.305 --> 00:26:10.088]  Hillary used the State Department as a whole parallel government, sometimes even against Obama's policies and other globalist policies, running her own system.
[00:26:10.088 --> 00:26:12.609]  She was co-president for eight years with Bill.
[00:26:12.609 --> 00:26:15.090]  She was co-president for eight years with Obama.
[00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:17.130]  And that's why the deep state's so arrogant.
[00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:23.753]  You've got all these different factions doing whatever they want, and nobody looking out for the American people.
[00:26:23.753 --> 00:26:24.433]  And here comes Trump.
[00:26:25.629 --> 00:26:26.871]  We're going to have bids again.
[00:26:26.871 --> 00:26:29.055]  We're going to actually cut taxes.
[00:26:29.055 --> 00:26:30.698]  We're actually going to secure the border.
[00:26:30.698 --> 00:26:33.022]  We're actually going to do the right thing for this country.
[00:26:33.022 --> 00:26:34.665]  We're actually going to get the stock market boosted.
[00:26:34.665 --> 00:26:37.510]  We're actually going to bring back a thousand plus companies that are already here.
[00:26:38.916 --> 00:26:43.539]  And the Federal Reserve, private, independent from government, its own fourth branch.
[00:26:43.539 --> 00:26:46.020]  That's the former head of the Federal Reserve's own words.
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:49.002]  Congress and the President can do nothing, they claim.
[00:26:49.002 --> 00:26:54.306]  Well, Congress should actually repeal the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, and we're close to doing it, so we can do something.
[00:26:54.306 --> 00:27:01.010]  But they said they're above the law and have raised interest rates four times, they say, to stop the Trump recovery.
[00:27:01.809 --> 00:27:02.830]  And they cheer!
[00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.231]  Yay!
[00:27:04.231 --> 00:27:07.133]  The Rasmussen polls down to 38!
[00:27:07.133 --> 00:27:07.894]  Gallup's down to 34!
[00:27:07.894 --> 00:27:14.259]  Well, that's because Gallup isn't as fake as Rasmussen.
[00:27:14.259 --> 00:27:22.466]  Just like all those clips and all those news articles during the campaign, when Trump was 15, 20 points behind than he won, it's called fake polls.
[00:27:22.466 --> 00:27:25.328]  That's coming up in the next segment, but here's Cy Hirsch.
[00:27:25.328 --> 00:27:26.429]  Here is Julian Assange.
[00:27:27.645 --> 00:27:39.069]  Hillary Clinton has done quite well strategically to try and draw connection between Trump and Russia because she has so many connections of her own.
[00:27:39.069 --> 00:27:43.170]  Now, my analysis of Trump and Russia
[00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:46.853]  Is that there is no substantial connection?
[00:27:46.853 --> 00:27:48.075]  Why do I say that?
[00:27:48.075 --> 00:27:58.145]  Well, because Trump was trying to invest in Russia before Putin in the 1990s, after Putin, in fact, nearly all the way up to the present moment.
[00:27:58.145 --> 00:27:59.866]  And he's had no success.
[00:27:59.866 --> 00:28:02.469]  He did not manage to build hotels and so on in Russia.
[00:28:02.469 --> 00:28:03.270]  So that shows how
[00:28:06.039 --> 00:28:10.081]  Um, insubstantial, uh, his contacts are.
[00:28:10.081 --> 00:28:22.186]  There's an extremely well-documented pattern of when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, those people, companies, governments, who wanted a decision by the Secretary of State in their favor.
[00:28:23.138 --> 00:28:31.264]  Making large donations to the Clinton Foundation or in some other cases business deals with the people around Hillary Clinton.
[00:28:31.264 --> 00:28:48.398]  Now one particular instance is the approval by Secretary Clinton of selling 20% of the US uranium reprocessing rights to a Russian company to be exported to Russia.
[00:28:49.534 --> 00:28:56.278]  So at that time, a large donation was made by those Russian interests to the Clinton Foundation.
[00:28:56.278 --> 00:29:03.263]  In addition, Clinton's campaign manager, Podesta, was on the board of a company called Jewel Unlimited.
[00:29:03.263 --> 00:29:13.669]  And Jewel Unlimited held some of these rights and received a $35 million investment from Russia.
[00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:15.130]  And there's a bunch of others as well.
[00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:18.452]  That's old news, but there's Assange telling the truth.
[00:29:20.467 --> 00:29:33.926]  Meanwhile, Trump has been bullied into signing the legislation for more sanctions against Russia today, and he's being basically bullied into troop increases, you name it, so he can prove he's not a Russian agent.
[00:29:35.356 --> 00:29:37.578]  He's not even supposed to talk to Putin at dinner.
[00:29:37.578 --> 00:29:38.819]  Or he's a Russian agent.
[00:29:38.819 --> 00:29:42.882]  It's one of the only areas that Trump has been manipulated into a corner.
[00:29:42.882 --> 00:29:46.005]  And notice, it's only made them say he's more of a Russian agent.
[00:29:46.005 --> 00:29:47.687]  He could nuke Russia!
[00:29:47.687 --> 00:29:50.769]  He could slice baby Russians' necks and drink their blood!
[00:29:50.769 --> 00:29:54.012]  That wouldn't be enough for John McCain, the walking brain tumor.
[00:29:54.012 --> 00:29:54.572]  We'll be back.
[00:29:54.572 --> 00:29:55.233]  Stay with us.
[00:29:55.233 --> 00:29:56.634]  We're on the march.
[00:29:56.634 --> 00:29:59.176]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:59.176 --> 00:30:01.839]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:06.809 --> 00:30:17.259]  It was Thomas Jefferson who once said that our country is now taking so steady a course as to show by what road it will pass to destruction to wit, by consolidation of power first and then corruption its necessary consequence.
[00:30:17.259 --> 00:30:24.646]  Jefferson was warning us about the global elite, the 1% of the 1%, consolidating the world's wealth and subverting the people's voice in government.
[00:30:24.646 --> 00:30:26.607]  Unfortunately, we didn't heed his advice.
[00:30:26.607 --> 00:30:32.653]  We now live in a neo-feudalistic society in which we're treated as indentured servants who only exist to serve the needs of the establishment.
[00:30:32.853 --> 00:30:40.363]  Political office no longer represents the voice of the people, but rather the initiation process politicians go through to gain acceptance into the aristocracy.
[00:30:40.363 --> 00:30:47.954]  Simply put, we the people are responsible for civilization and culture, yet we're suppressed by a tiny elite who have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around the world.
[00:30:48.174 --> 00:30:56.462]  We falsely believe that everything is simply black and white, one extreme against the other, conservative versus liberal, but things will change once more of us realize this truth.
[00:30:56.462 --> 00:31:03.769]  As Thomas Jefferson also said, enlighten the people generally and tyranny and oppressions of body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day.
[00:31:03.769 --> 00:31:06.231]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com
[00:31:06.471 --> 00:31:15.197]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?

[00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:35.490]  Woo!
[00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:36.530]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:45.273]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[00:31:45.273 --> 00:31:54.856]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[00:31:54.856 --> 00:31:58.317]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.

[00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:19.835]  This message is transmitted at the request of the President of the United States of America and the Office of Homeland Security.
[00:33:19.835 --> 00:33:25.179]  In compliance with the United Nations, the President of the United States has declared martial law.
[00:33:25.179 --> 00:33:26.480]  Curfew is now in place.
[00:33:35.348 --> 00:33:40.190]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:47.993]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:47.993 --> 00:33:56.437]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is what would have happened if Hillary would have been Madam President.
[00:33:58.339 --> 00:34:01.502]  You know, I ended up taking it home with me last night.
[00:34:01.502 --> 00:34:06.867]  I hadn't actually read the Madam President Newsweek from eight months ago.
[00:34:06.867 --> 00:34:14.615]  We'd shown the cover and shown the news articles that they had for the election that they actually even had some on source shelves that she was the president.
[00:34:14.615 --> 00:34:16.797]  Talk about fake news from Newsweek.
[00:34:16.797 --> 00:34:19.299]  But I actually read it last night and
[00:34:20.353 --> 00:34:23.435]  It is the richest comedy you've ever heard.
[00:34:23.435 --> 00:34:26.517]  It's how she beat him, what state she beat him in.
[00:34:26.517 --> 00:34:31.719]  I mean, it shows how scripted the attempt to steal the election was.
[00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:39.504]  Down to the six states she tried to steal, but the state officials caught Homeland Security breaking into.
[00:34:39.504 --> 00:34:43.166]  This thing is a roadmap to their fraud.
[00:34:43.166 --> 00:34:44.707]  It is amazing.
[00:34:45.578 --> 00:34:53.762]  So I'm going to shoot a special report on that little juicy in the next few days because it's a doozy.
[00:34:53.762 --> 00:35:01.146]  Sixty-something pages of pure, unadulterated, fake news, corporate fraud from Newsweek.
[00:35:01.146 --> 00:35:10.751]  You know, the same folks that say the case for rioting and cops deserve to die when they get shot in the back of the head pumping gas or pulling somebody over or changing a tire.
[00:35:10.751 --> 00:35:14.793]  And that I want violence and have told my listeners go out and quote
[00:35:16.092 --> 00:35:21.654]  Kill more liberals was the quote last week.
[00:35:21.654 --> 00:35:23.135]  But they don't show where I said it.
[00:35:23.135 --> 00:35:27.116]  They just have a fake quote that I said, go out and kill more liberals.
[00:35:27.116 --> 00:35:29.017]  No, I didn't say that.
[00:35:29.017 --> 00:35:30.518]  You said that Newsweek.
[00:35:30.518 --> 00:35:39.141]  What a pack of criminal scum, snot-nosed anti-American people that have had their foot on our neck forever.
[00:35:39.141 --> 00:35:43.863]  And now the sleeping giant is awake and they don't know what to do.
[00:35:45.157 --> 00:35:50.460]  So they got caught lying, so they just intensified the make-believe with a big cover story.
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:36:00.326]  There was a cover story on their website for two days that Alex Jones is trying to get a violent war going.
[00:36:00.326 --> 00:36:09.391]  No, we're kicking your traitorous, anti-American, globalist scum intellectually up the block and back down.
[00:36:09.391 --> 00:36:14.234]  We are stomping your little piggy faces into the ground.
[00:36:16.013 --> 00:36:18.393]  So, good luck.
[00:36:18.393 --> 00:36:23.114]  Good luck.
[00:36:23.114 --> 00:36:26.215]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:36:26.215 --> 00:36:27.155]  Oh, Newsweek!
[00:36:27.155 --> 00:36:28.615]  Tell me about Madam President again?
[00:36:28.615 --> 00:36:39.737]  And what state she won, and how she won, and how Trump was so evil, and... Now that Hillary's won, we've got to mop up, you know, the dangerous right-wing groups and ban their speech?
[00:36:39.737 --> 00:36:41.158]  Oh ho ho ho!
[00:36:41.158 --> 00:36:42.598]  Yes, we know about your whole plan.
[00:36:44.517 --> 00:36:47.178]  But it didn't go according to schedule.
[00:36:47.178 --> 00:36:49.178]  Now, here's the problem.
[00:36:49.178 --> 00:36:51.219]  They're manipulating the public with fake polls again.
[00:36:51.219 --> 00:36:51.999]  We're going to cover that.
[00:36:51.999 --> 00:36:54.240]  The latest on Obamacare.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:59.242]  We've got a senator, another neocon, Jeff Flake.
[00:36:59.242 --> 00:37:03.283]  The last name certainly fits the way he's acting.
[00:37:03.283 --> 00:37:04.823]  Saying he's proud to be a globalist.
[00:37:04.823 --> 00:37:09.025]  That means transferring your sovereignty to an international group.
[00:37:09.025 --> 00:37:09.965]  We're going to look at that.
[00:37:09.965 --> 00:37:13.426]  Senate Republicans slowly turning their backs on Trump.
[00:37:15.123 --> 00:37:15.703]  AP News.
[00:37:15.703 --> 00:37:17.625]  They're not slowly turning their backs.
[00:37:17.625 --> 00:37:21.087]  They always have been trying to slit his throat.
[00:37:21.087 --> 00:37:26.491]  But politically, they have to act like they're with him or they'll be removed from office.
[00:37:26.491 --> 00:37:29.213]  When Flake's running for office, he's a big nationalist and a patriot.
[00:37:29.213 --> 00:37:36.218]  But when he gets in, he's another establishment wannabe that gets off on being traitorous.
[00:37:36.218 --> 00:37:39.100]  He has that same weird, narcissist, bug-eyed
[00:37:41.206 --> 00:37:46.770]  Barracuda smile that all these people with their fake teeth and the rest of it have.
[00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:50.492]  What a joke!
[00:37:50.492 --> 00:37:57.117]  Meanwhile, back in the real world, media completely ignores bombshell Seymour Hersh revelations on Seth Rich.
[00:37:57.117 --> 00:38:02.240]  That's a powerful headline on Infowars.com, but not powerful enough.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:08.585]  It's Pulitzer Prize winning journalist reveals the identity of the DNC leaker.
[00:38:10.848 --> 00:38:20.171]  And the only thing I disagree with, with Hirsch, is they're saying, well, you know, there was a high crime area in D.C., maybe he really got mugged, maybe he really got shot.
[00:38:20.171 --> 00:38:26.152]  That's the oldest way to kill somebody and make it look like it wasn't a hit, was to claim it was a botched robbery.
[00:38:26.152 --> 00:38:32.434]  And everybody knows that one of the favorite assassin tools is a .22 long rifle.
[00:38:32.434 --> 00:38:35.695]  Doesn't make a big noise, put it up to somebody's head and pull the trigger.
[00:38:37.082 --> 00:38:39.203]  It's basically like a silenced weapon.
[00:38:39.203 --> 00:38:42.266]  No such thing as a silencer, they really call them suppressors.
[00:38:42.266 --> 00:38:58.056]  But that is a classic tool of assassination for over a hundred years by La Cosa Nostra, by Army Intelligence, and then by the CIA, is a .22 handgun.
[00:38:58.056 --> 00:38:59.657]  And that's a fact.
[00:38:59.657 --> 00:39:04.821]  A lot of folks like the Rugers as well because they contain not just the
[00:39:07.594 --> 00:39:20.142]  Report of, out of the barrel, but also out of the cartridge, uh, where it actually detonates farther back in the gun, the cap, detonating the powder and firing the projectile.
[00:39:20.142 --> 00:39:23.624]  I'm just telling you, it's a well-known assassination tool, is a .22.
[00:39:23.624 --> 00:39:24.484]  Very, very quiet.
[00:39:30.126 --> 00:39:32.787]  Ruger .22s are used in a lot of assassinations.
[00:39:32.787 --> 00:39:38.649]  Now, if you're inside a house and you don't care, it's a shotgun, because you don't get rifling off that.
[00:39:38.649 --> 00:39:40.990]  You just shoot somebody in the face with a double-aught buckshot.
[00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:49.033]  You should go ahead and shoot them in the chest for good measure, or you can, in the case of Gary Webb, just shoot him twice with a shotgun.
[00:39:49.033 --> 00:39:52.114]  But, see, he fought them, so they shot him in the side and in the head.
[00:39:52.114 --> 00:39:55.195]  But, I'm digressing.
[00:39:55.195 --> 00:39:56.696]  Let me just continue on with the news here.
[00:39:58.302 --> 00:40:09.705]  But regardless, he is the DNC leaker, and we have that from so many high-level sources, and that's why he's dead, and it's why they're so scared in the media, and saying, do not investigate, do not look at this.
[00:40:09.705 --> 00:40:14.567]  They're basically saying Seth Rich didn't exist right now.
[00:40:14.567 --> 00:40:18.648]  They're ridiculing anybody that looks at it, because they're so scared.
[00:40:18.648 --> 00:40:26.430]  Now, before I plow into all this news that I just mentioned, and a lot more, we are ending the July specials on August 2nd.
[00:40:28.032 --> 00:40:34.536]  And I customarily end up going a few days over on sales because I'm kind of chief cook and bottle washer around here.
[00:40:34.536 --> 00:40:39.038]  I've got to look at what we've got in stock, what we can discount, what's popular.
[00:40:39.038 --> 00:40:47.062]  We do have some new specials coming out tomorrow, but they won't be as extensive, obviously, because this has been such a big sale, such a deep sale.
[00:40:47.062 --> 00:40:51.865]  The sale last month has been the biggest ever, the longest, free shipping, you name it.
[00:40:51.865 --> 00:40:53.286]  The free shipping ends today.
[00:40:55.811 --> 00:41:02.621]  The 46% on MycoZx, the anti-fungal, anti-yeast, other part of the probiotic equation.
[00:41:02.621 --> 00:41:04.684]  That's the biggest discount ever on that.
[00:41:04.684 --> 00:41:06.147]  DNA 4 is 20% off.
[00:41:06.147 --> 00:41:08.050]  That's got to end today because it's about to sell out anyways.
[00:41:09.423 --> 00:41:12.065]  Alexa Pure Breeze, normally $219.
[00:41:12.065 --> 00:41:13.326]  Competitors are $400 to $600.
[00:41:13.326 --> 00:41:14.947]  It's $149.
[00:41:14.947 --> 00:41:17.588]  No one can beat that.
[00:41:17.588 --> 00:41:18.849]  Super high quality.
[00:41:18.849 --> 00:41:19.770]  Super high tech.
[00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:21.471]  Grabs the garbage out.
[00:41:21.471 --> 00:41:22.691]  Uses amazing systems.
[00:41:22.691 --> 00:41:22.711]  $149.
[00:41:22.711 --> 00:41:25.093]  You ought to buy a lot of these for your house.
[00:41:25.093 --> 00:41:30.696]  Because it does a big room, each one, but I've got four of them in my house, personally.
[00:41:30.696 --> 00:41:36.460]  I remove units that cost me $1,000 three years ago that are the same technology or aren't even as good.
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:37.701]  But again, that's miniaturization.
[00:41:39.258 --> 00:41:41.339]  When we first started selling these, the competition was $800 to $1,000.
[00:41:41.339 --> 00:41:44.780]  Now it's down to $400.
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:45.281]  And we're down to $149.
[00:41:45.281 --> 00:41:47.722]  Just, it is the best deal.
[00:41:47.722 --> 00:41:51.203]  ProPure Traveler, amazing stainless steel gravity-fed system.
[00:41:51.203 --> 00:41:53.764]  Blows away the competition.
[00:41:53.764 --> 00:41:58.066]  All the best filters we carry, Alexa Pure, ProPure, they're apples and oranges.
[00:41:58.066 --> 00:42:00.867]  They're good across the board, but ProPure is excellent.
[00:42:00.867 --> 00:42:03.589]  And at $132, 30% off, you cannot beat it.
[00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:06.070]  Super Silver Special, the colloidal silver, silver bullet.
[00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:16.079]  Super Blue Toothpaste is so popular with coital silver and iodine, no fluoride, and a power toothbrush that has silver impregnated into the bristles.
[00:42:16.079 --> 00:42:17.801]  Amazing!
[00:42:17.801 --> 00:42:21.225]  That is 50% off right now.
[00:42:21.225 --> 00:42:22.747]  Caveman Combo.
[00:42:22.747 --> 00:42:24.509]  This is what is being made fun of by
[00:42:25.885 --> 00:42:30.969]  John Oliver, when everybody who's done any research knows bone broth for two or three years has been the hottest thing out there.
[00:42:30.969 --> 00:42:32.970]  It was always hot with grandma, always hot with mom.
[00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:37.634]  If you were sick, she'd cook the bones of the chicken into the chicken noodle soup.
[00:42:37.634 --> 00:42:49.322]  It's known, well this is the bones absolutely taken fresh and then pulverized and it's got all the trace minerals, all the stuff that's in the marrow and it tastes great.
[00:42:50.263 --> 00:42:51.404]  I challenge anyone.
[00:42:51.404 --> 00:42:54.245]  It tastes okay when it's just water.
[00:42:54.245 --> 00:42:56.266]  But who does stuff like that with water?
[00:42:56.266 --> 00:42:58.327]  Folks mix it with protein, with whey.
[00:42:58.327 --> 00:43:00.688]  They put in milk.
[00:43:00.688 --> 00:43:01.789]  It's amazing.
[00:43:01.789 --> 00:43:07.311]  It tastes like ice cream with milk.
[00:43:07.311 --> 00:43:10.133]  And then they take a clip of me drinking it when I did a demonstration on air.
[00:43:10.133 --> 00:43:13.154]  So I didn't know that the folks who just put milk in it.
[00:43:13.154 --> 00:43:15.915]  I'm like, that tastes even better in the full clip.
[00:43:15.915 --> 00:43:16.716]  I say, what'd you do?
[00:43:16.716 --> 00:43:18.857]  And he goes, Oh, Buckley says I added milk.
[00:43:19.935 --> 00:43:23.817]  Oh yeah, it tastes, it's gone from tasting okay to really great, wow!
[00:43:23.817 --> 00:43:28.640]  And so the fact that I was like savoring it and really going, why is this different?
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:32.122]  Because I'm honest with folks, I'll tell you, Super Male tastes weird.
[00:43:32.122 --> 00:43:34.123]  It works though.
[00:43:34.123 --> 00:43:35.603]  Child Ease tastes great.
[00:43:35.603 --> 00:43:45.909]  A lot of our products taste really great, but I mean, stuff like Super Male, the iodine tastes kind of weird.
[00:43:47.608 --> 00:43:49.428]  Oh, and then he made fun of me.
[00:43:49.428 --> 00:43:56.910]  And he said that... I said, don't go get the random stuff at the store that's topical, eat a hole in your stomach and kill you.
[00:43:56.910 --> 00:43:57.750]  It can.
[00:43:57.750 --> 00:44:05.091]  You've got to go out and get this super high-grade, clean, unbound, properly certified iodine of a totally different type.
[00:44:05.091 --> 00:44:11.912]  And I love how they put a promo together that shows mainstream news saying, do not take store-bought iodine, it can kill you.
[00:44:11.912 --> 00:44:13.092]  Do the topical type.
[00:44:13.092 --> 00:44:16.113]  I mean, I'm just telling you what is a known fact.
[00:44:17.176 --> 00:44:19.118]  But again, they need to make it sound weird.
[00:44:19.118 --> 00:44:27.685]  Everybody knows about ox bone, beef bone, the marrow having the stem cells in it.
[00:44:27.685 --> 00:44:33.911]  Anybody who's smart, anybody from the country, anybody from Europe, especially, that's where bone broth's big over there.
[00:44:33.911 --> 00:44:36.553]  Everybody knows you're sick, you take bone broth.
[00:44:36.553 --> 00:44:43.980]  Everybody knows in weight loss, they do these bone broth juice fasts that are just in the craze for 20 years in Hollywood, because they actually work.
[00:44:45.089 --> 00:44:47.714]  So I go out and I research the hottest thing is bone broth.
[00:44:47.714 --> 00:44:49.396]  I find out there's hardly any competitors.
[00:44:49.396 --> 00:44:53.423]  I find out the stuff they've got is watered down.
[00:44:53.423 --> 00:44:57.911]  I set out with the top manufacturer in the company to put out the ultimate bone broth formula.
[00:44:59.471 --> 00:45:01.152]  It becomes the national bestseller.
[00:45:01.152 --> 00:45:04.674]  It is now the national bestseller of any bone broth product.
[00:45:04.674 --> 00:45:12.699]  And it's their job on HBO to make that sound weird and say that it's the dried dust of domesticated bird skeletons.
[00:45:12.699 --> 00:45:16.221]  He can technically say that because a chicken is a domesticated bird.
[00:45:16.221 --> 00:45:20.403]  But it sounds really weird like I'm killing parrots and putting them in a blender or something.
[00:45:22.697 --> 00:45:24.278]  Again, that's their job.
[00:45:24.278 --> 00:45:37.409]  Take something that is as wholesome as it gets, chicken noodle soup to the next level, basically, mixed with chaga mushroom, turmeric, bee pollen, all of it.
[00:45:37.409 --> 00:45:41.672]  They even make it sound weird I'm selling coffee, just like D Magazine did.
[00:45:41.672 --> 00:45:45.796]  I'm a scammer, I'm claiming coffee's really good.
[00:45:45.796 --> 00:45:48.298]  They make fun of our toothpaste.
[00:45:48.298 --> 00:45:50.419]  By the way, the bubble gum, without the
[00:45:51.857 --> 00:45:55.061]  Peppermint and without the tea tree is in because it's a little too strong for kids.
[00:45:55.061 --> 00:45:56.644]  Our super blue is concentrated.
[00:45:56.644 --> 00:45:57.645]  It's a bestseller.
[00:45:57.645 --> 00:45:59.147]  Folks are reordering it at record numbers.
[00:45:59.147 --> 00:46:03.173]  It's super popular because it works so good.
[00:46:03.173 --> 00:46:07.098]  The bubble gum has been gone for, again, almost six months.
[00:46:08.148 --> 00:46:14.111]  We're trying to fix our supply issues, but we have to get in at the big national factory that makes Tom's of Maine, everybody else.
[00:46:14.111 --> 00:46:18.293]  And you gotta get the tubes in, it's gotta all be prepared, they gotta get the factory ready to run it.
[00:46:18.293 --> 00:46:22.876]  And then you get in the queue, and it's a hassle, but bubblegum.
[00:46:24.076 --> 00:46:25.477]  Natural flavor is now back.
[00:46:25.477 --> 00:46:26.778]  Kids love it.
[00:46:26.778 --> 00:46:28.839]  Bubblegum is now back available.
[00:46:28.839 --> 00:46:30.040]  4.7 stars.
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:30.840]  Does have the iodine.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:31.701]  Does have the clonal silver.
[00:46:31.701 --> 00:46:35.083]  But doesn't have the really strong peppermint in it.
[00:46:35.083 --> 00:46:36.684]  That even for adults, they say it's strong.
[00:46:36.684 --> 00:46:38.065]  It's concentrated!
[00:46:38.065 --> 00:46:39.406]  So that's back in stock now.
[00:46:39.406 --> 00:46:41.147]  That's discounted.
[00:46:41.147 --> 00:46:41.688]  Out of the gates.
[00:46:41.688 --> 00:46:44.710]  I guess it is discounted.
[00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:46.511]  I wanted to discount that 25%.
[00:46:46.511 --> 00:46:48.332]  So, that just came back in yesterday.
[00:46:48.332 --> 00:46:49.753]  We're going to add that to 25% off.
[00:46:49.753 --> 00:46:50.934]  I notice it's not.
[00:46:50.934 --> 00:46:51.874]  We're going to sell that for $9.95.
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:47:00.484]  Now, continuing, ladies and gentlemen, that's how you fund the operation, and the globalists hate it, but it's all ending today.
[00:47:00.484 --> 00:47:10.590]  The free shipping, all those specials, 50% off on the silver package, 66% off on the silver bullet, colloidal silver, the free shipping on top of it.
[00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:21.857]  Some of these items are lost leaders, but I want you to experience how good they are, and I want you to get either the chocolate flavor or strawberry flavor of the caveman, ultimate caveman, ultimate cave,
[00:47:22.915 --> 00:47:30.704]  Bone broth formula and I want you to try it with just water and taste okay.
[00:47:30.704 --> 00:47:37.693]  And I want you to try it with milk and a few ice cubes and tell me if it doesn't taste delicious.
[00:47:37.693 --> 00:47:42.459]  The issue is though a lot of folks are using it for weight loss because it's so filling.
[00:47:44.343 --> 00:47:51.288]  That's why some people now are actually whipping it up in a blender and then freezing it and eating it like, kind of like yogurt ice cream or something.
[00:47:51.288 --> 00:47:54.290]  I mean, in fact, we're going to do a whole, I'm doing a taste test.
[00:47:54.290 --> 00:48:08.139]  I think I'm going to go down the hike and bike trail with a whole setup and do a taste test of it versus Frosty's from someplace like Wendy's.
[00:48:08.139 --> 00:48:11.622]  Because I want to show people, we did taste tests with the Pro-Pure.
[00:48:12.642 --> 00:48:20.725]  Leanne did a few years ago down there right next to tap water and everybody liked our filtered water over tap water.
[00:48:20.725 --> 00:48:23.546]  They're always saying tap water tastes so great, tap water is so good.
[00:48:23.546 --> 00:48:29.368]  You're insane if you're drinking tap water in most cities or even most small towns and most well waters contaminated.
[00:48:29.368 --> 00:48:30.649]  You're nuts!
[00:48:30.649 --> 00:48:34.450]  And he says I'm a kook for selling water filters to protect you
[00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:35.411]  Yes, that's what it's called.
[00:48:35.411 --> 00:48:36.131]  Symbiotic relationship.
[00:48:36.131 --> 00:48:39.233]  If I was a car dealer, I would go out and sell the cars that I personally like.
[00:48:39.233 --> 00:48:43.536]  You know, do what you love, sell what you like, sell good products, sell products people get a great response off of.
[00:49:08.018 --> 00:49:09.519]  I want you to like it.
[00:49:09.519 --> 00:49:15.722]  Why would I put out a bone broth formula that tastes like crap?
[00:49:15.722 --> 00:49:23.247]  It took us over a year and a half, scores of different types to finally get a recipe that tasted okay.
[00:49:23.247 --> 00:49:25.348]  And I said on the full show, okay.
[00:49:25.348 --> 00:49:29.150]  He knows in that same video, I said it tastes okay without the milk.
[00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:30.651]  It tastes so much better with the milk.
[00:49:30.651 --> 00:49:34.033]  He knows that, but he misrepresented to you because he's a liar.
[00:49:34.713 --> 00:49:43.897]  That's why I haven't properly responded yet, because I'm going to show you what I fully said, just like with Megyn Kelly, and then I'm going to show you where he said I was a liar by editing it, because he's not even a liar.
[00:49:43.897 --> 00:49:46.659]  John Oliver is a facsimile.
[00:49:46.659 --> 00:49:49.700]  He's like a computer program.
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:50:01.226]  He's a guy that comes in and looks ironic and looks nerdly for his nerd audience to make them feel less nerdly, and then he does little ironic faces and reads off a teleprompter written by, in some cases, over a hundred different contributors.
[00:50:02.068 --> 00:50:05.810]  He took him weeks to put together a 20-minute piece on me.
[00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:14.414]  Everything they threw at us, total lies, total fraud, total scams, total deception, upside-down inversion of reality, but it failed.
[00:50:14.414 --> 00:50:24.738]  Because all your fake polls and all your demonization pieces and all your misrepresenting what I've said and done only affects the most brain-dead, drooling morons that are still under your control.
[00:50:24.738 --> 00:50:25.359]  But I digress.
[00:50:25.959 --> 00:50:35.845]  The big sales in today, thank you all for supporting us, but most importantly, pray for the broadcast and support our local affiliates, support their local sponsors, become a sponsor, or tithe every month!
[00:50:36.772 --> 00:50:43.054]  The local radio station, send them $20, $100, or just spread the word about that local station.
[00:50:43.054 --> 00:50:47.335]  But that's another part of the equation supporting those local affiliates.
[00:50:47.335 --> 00:50:54.936]  We'll be right back on the other side with the fake polls, the latest on Obamacare, and so much more.
[00:50:54.936 --> 00:50:58.797]  Eric Trump says President tougher than DC swamp carrying country on his back.
[00:50:58.797 --> 00:50:59.698]  I totally agree.
[00:50:59.698 --> 00:51:02.938]  A lot of folks want to sit on the fence about Trump, not me.
[00:51:02.938 --> 00:51:04.819]  I'm all in because he's all in.
[00:51:06.388 --> 00:51:11.532]  A great president once said, the nine most feared words in the English language.
[00:51:11.532 --> 00:51:14.214]  I am from the government and I'm here to help.
[00:51:14.214 --> 00:51:17.437]  Adequacy of loss, absorbing capacity.
[00:51:17.437 --> 00:51:18.738]  You call that help?
[00:51:18.738 --> 00:51:20.939]  That's the mandate approved by the G20.
[00:51:20.939 --> 00:51:23.021]  The banks can steal your money!
[00:51:23.021 --> 00:51:25.183]  Well, they can't steal your gold and silver.
[00:51:25.183 --> 00:51:34.190]  That you fully control, you can have it delivered into an IRA at a depository under lock and key, where you can hide it, where no one can find it, not even your wife.
[00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.550]  What?
[00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:35.951]  Sorry, honey.
[00:51:35.951 --> 00:51:40.535]  Your CDs, money market accounts, and savings accounts are all at risk!

[00:52:05.447 --> 00:52:09.210]  If food became scarce, would you be able to feed yourself and your family?
[00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:18.156]  Have you found some emergency food supplies can cost upwards of $300 for a month's supply, and worst of all, they're packed with chemicals and other unpronounceable ingredients?

[00:53:36.982 --> 00:53:40.062]  Radio remains the most intimate of all forms of media.
[00:53:40.062 --> 00:53:40.643]  At home.
[00:53:40.643 --> 00:53:41.303]  At work.
[00:53:41.303 --> 00:53:42.103]  In the car.

[00:54:02.928 --> 00:54:03.588]  Effective.
[00:54:10.699 --> 00:54:17.860]  Oh, John Oliver came out and put out a piece that took him a couple weeks to put together, lying about InfoWars.
[00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:23.421]  And look, HBO hack InsiderSphere leaked emails as FBI joins investigation.
[00:54:23.421 --> 00:54:26.262]  Wonder what we'll find out about old HBO.
[00:54:26.262 --> 00:54:27.842]  Wonder what's going to be in that Hollywood hack.
[00:54:27.842 --> 00:54:30.463]  There's always a lot of goodies.
[00:54:30.463 --> 00:54:33.863]  Rasmussen, Trump approval down to 38.
[00:54:33.863 --> 00:54:37.544]  Coming up in the next hour, I'm going to break all that down and show how it's a fraud.
[00:54:38.942 --> 00:54:40.923]  And go over the history of that information.
[00:54:40.923 --> 00:54:42.885]  Dinesh D'Souza is going to be joining us.
[00:54:42.885 --> 00:54:47.628]  He's got a new book out that is very powerful.
[00:54:47.628 --> 00:54:50.910]  The Big Lie, Exposing the Nazi Roots of the American Left.
[00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:52.412]  Wait till you hear this.
[00:54:52.412 --> 00:54:53.352]  You think you know it all?
[00:54:53.352 --> 00:54:55.033]  Believe me, I even learned some stuff.
[00:54:55.033 --> 00:54:56.955]  James Wesley Rawls is joining us.
[00:54:56.955 --> 00:54:58.316]  Mark Goldman's joining us.
[00:54:58.316 --> 00:55:00.097]  Roger Stone is joining us.
[00:55:00.097 --> 00:55:01.738]  It's all coming up today.
[00:55:01.738 --> 00:55:08.383]  But first, I saw this number yesterday and it even shocked me from Interpol.
[00:55:10.049 --> 00:55:23.091]  Previously, 80% of the, quote, refugees coming into Europe, now it's 10 million according to the UN, they run the EU migrant program and they flood your country, were military age men.
[00:55:23.091 --> 00:55:30.773]  And I knew that less than 1% were Christian, even though 20% roughly of Syria was Christian until the ethnic cleansing of the globalists.
[00:55:30.773 --> 00:55:36.894]  Well now it's being reported that just over 1% of migrants arriving in Italy are Syrian refugees.
[00:55:37.915 --> 00:55:40.237]  This according to the Italian government.
[00:55:40.237 --> 00:55:43.900]  That article's up on Infowars.com.
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:44.801]  Isn't that just cute?
[00:55:44.801 --> 00:55:48.564]  Just 1% of migrants arriving in Italy are Syrian refugees.
[00:55:48.564 --> 00:55:55.770]  And most of the so-called Syrians that were there are folks that invaded Syria as part of the Arab Spring.
[00:55:55.770 --> 00:55:59.393]  Syria's not really Arab, but it's always getting invaded by the Arabs.
[00:55:59.393 --> 00:56:00.754]  That's how you get things in the Middle East.
[00:56:00.754 --> 00:56:01.515]  You go steal them.
[00:56:02.813 --> 00:56:13.476]  New figures show that just 1.4% of migrants arriving in Italy are Syrian refugees, confirming the fact that the overwhelming majority of people flooding into Europe are economic migrants from countries not at war.
[00:56:13.476 --> 00:56:18.278]  But they just say, oh, they're war-torn Christians, when they're not.
[00:56:18.278 --> 00:56:24.340]  Or they always say, oh, it's boys, it's children, it's boys that raped and killed a woman.
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:28.061]  Kind of like, oh, we're letting children in from Mexico.
[00:56:28.061 --> 00:56:30.342]  And most of them aren't from Mexico, and most of them aren't children.
[00:56:31.532 --> 00:56:34.114]  Something like 17% were under the age of 18.
[00:56:34.114 --> 00:56:36.636]  But the children are here!
[00:56:36.636 --> 00:56:44.522]  Yes, one guy got deported 20 times, and he just got indicted again for more criminal activity.
[00:56:44.522 --> 00:56:59.174]  The numbers obtained by the Westminster via Eurostat, the official body tasked with providing statistical information to the Institution of the European Union, underscores how the true nature of the migrant crisis is being completely misrepresented by the press, left-wing groups, and politicians.
[00:57:00.626 --> 00:57:16.215]  And it goes on to say that out of 58,000 they sampled, just 845 were supposedly Syrians, and most of them weren't even Syrians either, if you look at those numbers.
[00:57:16.215 --> 00:57:21.597]  Meanwhile, there's a story by Kit Daniels breaking more of this down.
[00:57:21.597 --> 00:57:23.579]  Report!
[00:57:23.579 --> 00:57:25.860]  71% of Italians oppose migrant invasion.
[00:57:27.025 --> 00:57:28.726]  That's a Dan Lyman report.
[00:57:28.726 --> 00:57:30.007]  Kid, I guess, handed it to me.
[00:57:30.007 --> 00:57:33.550]  Panic building as migrants flood Italy in tidal waves.
[00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:49.583]  And the answer, of course, is a new EU Navy to make sure that the Italian Navy doesn't stop them or turn them back from the Soros Zodiac boats that go out and pick them up on the coast of Libya and then bring them back in to rape, kill and destroy.
[00:57:50.464 --> 00:58:00.116]  Then they tell Europeans, you've got to get rid of your free speech to comply with Sharia, and they air TV ads from Italy to Germany showing women in hijabs saying, do you wear the hijab?
[00:58:00.116 --> 00:58:01.378]  Do you join Islam?
[00:58:01.378 --> 00:58:02.179]  Islam is good!
[00:58:02.179 --> 00:58:03.961]  Join Islam today!
[00:58:03.961 --> 00:58:06.785]  Official UN reports.
[00:58:06.785 --> 00:58:07.966]  And now, the...
[00:58:09.341 --> 00:58:23.767]  Scottish government is defending TV pieces they funded, and art pieces they funded, with black people dancing around saying the Scots are scum, and will be defeated, they will be bred out, you are inbred, you are scum, you will die.
[00:58:23.767 --> 00:58:29.469]  There's a new article and the government says, yes, and it's black guys dancing around going, you are white, you are scum, you will die.
[00:58:31.468 --> 00:58:33.750]  I mean, and you're just like, what is going on here?
[00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:36.112]  Well, the globalists have already exploited the third world.
[00:58:36.112 --> 00:58:37.634]  They can look at the demographics.
[00:58:37.634 --> 00:58:40.376]  They're going to turn, the minorities are bringing in racists.
[00:58:40.376 --> 00:58:42.398]  They're going to totally balkanize society with it.
[00:58:42.398 --> 00:58:49.045]  This is a military wrecking ball operation run by Soros, the Democratic Party, and the globalists.
[00:58:49.045 --> 00:58:51.247]  I mean, it's incredible.
[00:58:51.247 --> 00:58:52.348]  Second hour coming up.
[00:58:56.705 --> 00:59:01.368]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:59:01.368 --> 00:59:14.318]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[00:59:14.318 --> 00:59:20.882]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:59:20.882 --> 00:59:23.344]  And so I set out to develop caveman.
[00:59:23.424 --> 00:59:34.649]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[00:59:34.649 --> 00:59:36.990]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:38.471]  We're getting results.
[00:59:38.471 --> 00:59:44.414]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[00:59:44.574 --> 00:59:47.455]  Caveman is finally back at the InfoWars store.
[00:59:47.455 --> 00:59:54.378]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free, AAA253313.
[00:59:54.378 --> 00:59:58.780]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:32.378 --> 01:00:35.899]  We now take you live.
[01:00:35.899 --> 01:00:42.361]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:00:42.361 --> 01:00:44.961]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:44.961 --> 01:00:50.563]  So YouTube's announcing censorship of anything conservative, libertarian, or patriotic, or common sense.
[01:00:50.563 --> 01:00:53.483]  Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, they're all doing it.
[01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:58.945]  And they're hiring these lynch mobs that are given the power to go out and declare things evil or racist so they can then be banned.
[01:00:59.645 --> 01:01:01.125]  You know, like the word mother or father.
[01:01:01.125 --> 01:01:07.527]  Now a professor who refuses to stop saying men and women exist has been banned from YouTube.
[01:01:07.527 --> 01:01:09.808]  That's coming up in the next segment with Dinesh D'Souza.
[01:01:09.808 --> 01:01:12.809]  But first, here's a report on Twitter lynch mobs.
[01:01:12.809 --> 01:01:14.929]  Twitter allows you to spread information instantly.
[01:01:14.929 --> 01:01:18.370]  Tweets can go viral within minutes and narratives formed even faster.
[01:01:18.370 --> 01:01:22.111]  Upon a cursory consideration, one might believe this is a positive thing.
[01:01:22.111 --> 01:01:27.153]  However, it's often the case that narratives can spread first, while the facts trail far, far behind.
[01:01:27.813 --> 01:01:35.723]  If a tweet appears to confirm our fondest hopes or darkest fears, it's only natural that we'd instantly hit that retweet button with little consideration for its veracity.
[01:01:35.723 --> 01:01:41.470]  The ability to breed in-group solidarity with one click leads to an abandonment of basic evidentiary standards.
[01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:43.193]  That's human nature and it's understandable.
[01:01:43.553 --> 01:01:48.216]  This tweet-first-think-later approach predictably leads to kangaroo courts of public opinion.
[01:01:48.216 --> 01:01:49.858]  Essentially, mob rule.
[01:01:49.858 --> 01:01:58.224]  This phenomenon manifested itself on Twitter when 35,000 individuals retweeted a photo of a man that was accused of randomly pulling the headpiece off a Muslim.
[01:01:58.224 --> 01:02:02.047]  The tweets read, This man at Baker Street forcefully attempted to pull my hijab off.
[01:02:02.047 --> 01:02:04.989]  When I instinctively grabbed a hold of my scarf, he hit me.
[01:02:04.989 --> 01:02:09.012]  He proceeded to verbally abuse my friends and I, pinning one of them against the wall and spitting in her face.
[01:02:09.412 --> 01:02:13.715]  Over 2,000 users angrily condemned the man and claimed that they would like to violently attack him.
[01:02:13.715 --> 01:02:21.121]  Many more called for his name, phone number, and work and home address as to be published to presumably harass him for this most contemptible act.
[01:02:21.121 --> 01:02:31.128]  One problem, though initially there were many calls to violence and harassment, there were not very many tweets to the tune of perhaps we should wait till the police investigate after all we've only heard one side of the story.
[01:02:31.128 --> 01:02:33.991]  Confirmation bias had swept thousands away like
[01:02:34.611 --> 01:02:37.174]  An engorged river after heavy rainfall.
[01:02:37.174 --> 01:02:41.398]  Not even verified Twitter accounts were safe as they began sticking their followers on the man.
[01:02:41.398 --> 01:02:42.279]  This is so awful.
[01:02:42.279 --> 01:02:42.819]  I retweeted.
[01:02:42.819 --> 01:02:46.363]  I hope they find this horrible person and lock him up.
[01:02:46.363 --> 01:02:53.289]  Hundreds of thousands of cursory observers saw hundreds of tweets and articles pour in that made them feel morally righteous and tingly inside.
[01:02:53.289 --> 01:02:58.735]  In their mind, it was an indisputable fact that this man was an unadulterated racist Islamophobe or something.
[01:02:59.255 --> 01:03:04.761]  So naturally, it became their moral obligation to insert a valuable half-second into retweeting this.
[01:03:04.761 --> 01:03:14.010]  But taking a few minutes to assess the preponderance of evidence would be, I think, a much more reasonable approach to this accusation than, someone should have pushed him onto the tracks.
[01:03:14.010 --> 01:03:19.516]  You see, a cursory investigation of the available information revealed that there was indeed another side to the story.
[01:03:19.516 --> 01:03:22.559]  The man accused of attacking and tearing away this woman's hijab made this statement.
[01:03:22.899 --> 01:03:30.986]  Quote, in regard to recent evidence, I was accused of completely false allegation because I defended my partner by trying to completely defuse a racist attack from three other random females.
[01:03:30.986 --> 01:03:37.912]  As a result, one of the females in particular responded by making malicious completely false allegations against me and I would like to confirm I never hit or attacked anyone.
[01:03:37.912 --> 01:03:40.875]  I simply defused a situation by separating them.
[01:03:40.875 --> 01:03:49.862]  The police is fully cooperating with me and will be able to obtain CCTV footage showing three women attempting to attack my partner because we are in an interracial relationship.
[01:03:49.862 --> 01:03:50.283]  End quote.
[01:03:50.663 --> 01:03:55.228]  So, two completely conflicting stories, one of which sounding patently more reasonable than the other.
[01:03:55.228 --> 01:04:01.855]  Not to mention that this woman did not appear willing to stand by her tweet, as it has now been deleted, banishing it into the twitlight zone.
[01:04:01.855 --> 01:04:05.258]  Regardless, it would appear we'd need to see evidence before jumping to conclusions.
[01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:07.721]  Alright, the full video is up on InfoWars.com.
[01:04:07.721 --> 01:04:08.842]  It's far worse than this.
[01:04:08.842 --> 01:04:13.286]  They encourage on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter the left going out and doing this on purpose.
[01:04:13.286 --> 01:04:13.607]  It's like...
[01:04:14.207 --> 01:04:14.648]  J.K.
[01:04:14.648 --> 01:04:24.719]  Rowling's saying that Trump wouldn't shake the little kid in the wheelchair's hand when he goes over first to him, hugs him, pats on him, talks to him more than all the other people basically combined.
[01:04:24.719 --> 01:04:27.262]  Then later he's walking out, little kid reaches for him.
[01:04:27.262 --> 01:04:29.565]  Trump doesn't see it, so that's his fault.
[01:04:29.565 --> 01:04:32.027]  Just like when the Polish president and his wife walk out.
[01:04:32.628 --> 01:04:36.909]  Trump's wife reaches out first, so the Polish president shakes her hand first, then Trump's.
[01:04:36.909 --> 01:04:41.711]  Kind of like somebody walks up, you both stick your hands out, you shake the woman's first, then you shake the other one.
[01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:42.551]  Isn't a diss.
[01:04:42.551 --> 01:04:51.594]  But it's all about shunning, and it's all about keeping people in arrested development junior high mentality, like we're in the third grade, and who is the cool kid?
[01:04:52.785 --> 01:05:03.636]  After all, that's what modern leftism is, is creating arrested development, isolated, alone individuals who can be controlled by AI systems, according to Facebook's own documents leaked to The Australian three months ago.
[01:05:06.607 --> 01:05:08.728]  December 23rd, 1776.
[01:05:08.728 --> 01:05:12.070]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[01:05:12.070 --> 01:05:17.073]  The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country.
[01:05:17.073 --> 01:05:21.876]  But he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.
[01:05:21.876 --> 01:05:24.498]  Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered.
[01:05:24.498 --> 01:05:26.239]  Yet we have this consolation with us.
[01:05:26.559 --> 01:05:29.500]  At the heart of the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:32.521]  What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly.
[01:05:32.521 --> 01:05:35.501]  It is dearness only that gives everything its value.
[01:05:35.501 --> 01:05:38.622]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods.
[01:05:38.622 --> 01:05:44.224]  And it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.
[01:05:44.224 --> 01:05:44.524]  Britain.
[01:05:44.944 --> 01:05:52.589]  With an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right, not only to tax, but to bind us in all cases whatsoever.
[01:05:52.589 --> 01:05:57.832]  And if being bound in that matter is not slavery, then there is no such thing as slavery upon Earth.
[01:05:57.832 --> 01:06:02.815]  Even the expression is impious, for so unlimited a power can only belong to God.
[01:06:03.715 --> 01:06:06.337]  Thomas Payne, the American Crisis.
[01:06:06.337 --> 01:06:11.741]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:06:11.741 --> 01:06:14.583]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[01:06:14.583 --> 01:06:16.565]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[01:06:16.565 --> 01:06:21.589]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:23.690]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:06:23.690 --> 01:06:24.991]  In fact, it's certified.
[01:06:24.991 --> 01:06:30.095]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:06:30.095 --> 01:06:33.458]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants
[01:06:33.598 --> 01:06:36.959]  That your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:06:36.959 --> 01:06:39.961]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:06:39.961 --> 01:06:43.662]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:06:43.662 --> 01:06:50.565]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:06:50.565 --> 01:06:58.068]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver, and more.

[01:07:02.050 --> 01:07:08.017]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:07:08.017 --> 01:07:10.039]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:07:10.039 --> 01:07:11.421]  It's the air we're breathing.
[01:07:11.421 --> 01:07:12.942]  Especially for our children.
[01:07:12.942 --> 01:07:16.166]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is at work.
[01:07:16.206 --> 01:07:18.988]  Absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:07:18.988 --> 01:07:28.195]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:07:28.195 --> 01:07:35.721]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:07:35.721 --> 01:07:43.747]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:07:43.747 --> 01:07:44.708]  The general public doesn't.
[01:07:45.917 --> 01:07:49.301]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:07:49.301 --> 01:07:53.445]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:07:53.445 --> 01:08:00.152]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:08:00.152 --> 01:08:04.277]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:08:17.265 --> 01:08:22.816]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[01:08:22.816 --> 01:08:25.462]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:08:41.284 --> 01:08:50.691]  Well, the Attorney General has announced plans to actually look at attacks on white people, racial attacks on white folks.
[01:08:50.691 --> 01:08:56.556]  The Justice Department has also announced they're going to look at whites being kicked out of higher education.
[01:08:56.556 --> 01:09:02.500]  And the leftist media, MSNBC, you name it, is calling this racist.
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:08.605]  Because they now teach, as you see every day, in Europe and the United States, that being white is inherently evil.
[01:09:09.755 --> 01:09:13.156]  And that whites are these mutants, and that we have to be gotten rid of.
[01:09:13.156 --> 01:09:17.478]  I mean, I've got three articles in mainstream news with the Scottish government funding it, the U.S.
[01:09:17.478 --> 01:09:18.179]  government funding it.
[01:09:18.179 --> 01:09:26.322]  We see colleges in Oregon having weekends where the whites aren't allowed, and liberal professors even say, well, that's racist.
[01:09:26.322 --> 01:09:30.964]  And then they get driven off campus.
[01:09:30.964 --> 01:09:33.005]  This is by design.
[01:09:33.005 --> 01:09:38.948]  The difference is we've contained it on the universities and in the federal government, so they're eating their own now.
[01:09:40.031 --> 01:09:50.836]  And that's what's happening is because the most radical elements are then dominating the debate in the leftist echo chambers and creating fascism.
[01:09:50.836 --> 01:09:53.537]  And I've said that many times and that's what Dinesh D'Souza breaks down.
[01:09:53.537 --> 01:09:56.459]  It's not that he's plagiarizing me or I'm plagiarizing him.
[01:09:56.459 --> 01:09:58.139]  We're looking at the same thing.
[01:09:58.139 --> 01:10:01.381]  It's like we're both at the Grand Canyon at the same spot.
[01:10:01.381 --> 01:10:01.921]  What do you see?
[01:10:01.921 --> 01:10:03.222]  I see the biggest canyon in the world.
[01:10:03.222 --> 01:10:03.602]  It's beautiful.
[01:10:04.722 --> 01:10:07.544]  Yeah, look at that blue jay sitting in the tree.
[01:10:07.544 --> 01:10:26.896]  Well, we're looking at this, and we're seeing frothing people hitting women in the head with bike locks, macing men, women, and children, beating people where they're putting comas, and it's in the WikiLeaks that Hillary Clinton sent them out there, and the media turns around and says that libertarians or conservatives did it.
[01:10:27.932 --> 01:10:43.441]  And so the very same Democratic Party that was the party of race baiting and of the KKK has flipped it now, looked at demographics and is trying to turn minorities that are the new majority, about to be the super majority, into
[01:10:44.767 --> 01:10:51.550]  Race-based operatives as well, instead of it being based on a culture of free market, prosperity, and free association.
[01:10:51.550 --> 01:10:52.710]  The book's excellent.
[01:10:52.710 --> 01:10:55.671]  In fact, I want to carry it to Infowarsstore.com, but we're not yet.
[01:10:55.671 --> 01:10:59.573]  The Big Lie Exposing the Nazi Roots of the American Left.
[01:10:59.573 --> 01:11:08.596]  Dinesh D'Souza, who also was a political prisoner, got five of his friends to give money to a Senate candidate that was his friend from college, didn't sign the right paperwork.
[01:11:09.639 --> 01:11:16.142]  Meanwhile, Hillary gets $30 million for Russian uranium transfers of U.S.
[01:11:16.142 --> 01:11:17.403]  uranium.
[01:11:17.403 --> 01:11:20.304]  $12 million in Morocco to sell out our interest.
[01:11:20.304 --> 01:11:21.425]  It's simply incredible.
[01:11:21.425 --> 01:11:23.966]  And now they're calling for me to be criminally arrested in Newsweek.
[01:11:25.336 --> 01:11:30.378]  And they've got congressional hearings saying I'm a Russian spy with no proof and that I'm under criminal investigation.
[01:11:30.378 --> 01:11:32.539]  So this is quite a club to be in here.
[01:11:32.539 --> 01:11:36.220]  These people are dangerous, folks, and they're lying to a new level.
[01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:37.760]  So it's not just political violence.
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.361]  They're now lying violently.
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:44.203]  Newsweek last week said that I'm calling for, quote, killing more liberals.
[01:11:44.203 --> 01:11:45.664]  They don't show where I said it.
[01:11:45.664 --> 01:11:47.305]  They don't show a link.
[01:11:47.305 --> 01:11:49.206]  They just lie.
[01:11:49.206 --> 01:11:54.250]  So they've gone into an insane mode, and they're very dangerous.
[01:11:54.250 --> 01:11:57.392]  They're putting out fake polls on the president, just like they did with Hillary.
[01:11:57.392 --> 01:12:00.034]  The big lie exposing the Nazi roots of the American left.
[01:12:00.034 --> 01:12:07.259]  Dinesh D'Souza, a documentary filmmaker, former cabinet official, a department head in the Reagan administration.
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.181]  Joining us to talk about the big lie.
[01:12:10.181 --> 01:12:13.083]  I mean, you've heard me kind of set up the interview.
[01:12:13.083 --> 01:12:14.464]  There's so many examples.
[01:12:14.464 --> 01:12:15.965]  It's so wild-eyed now.
[01:12:15.965 --> 01:12:17.847]  It's so crazy now.
[01:12:17.847 --> 01:12:27.453]  I mean, you rightfully say that we're going from the left being racist to fascist.
[01:12:27.453 --> 01:12:28.554]  What's really happening here?
[01:12:29.690 --> 01:12:39.869]  Well, I think what's remarkable is that the new fascism of our time marches behind the banner of anti-fascism.
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:56.915]  So that when you look at the people who are wearing masks, carrying weapons, blocking people from speaking, relying on a kind of intimidation and terrorism to cow everybody into silence.
[01:12:56.915 --> 01:13:02.501]  These are the modern day equivalents of Mussolini's black shirts and Hitler's brown shirts.
[01:13:03.081 --> 01:13:10.983]  The difference is that the black shirts and the brown shirts happily wore the label, whereas these new guys call themselves Antifa.
[01:13:10.983 --> 01:13:14.043]  They pretend to be fighting fascism.
[01:13:14.043 --> 01:13:17.104]  So the fascist theme is back in American politics.
[01:13:17.104 --> 01:13:22.745]  They're trying to pin the fascist label on Trump, on the Republicans.
[01:13:22.745 --> 01:13:28.947]  They have for a long time been cultivating the idea that fascism is a phenomenon of the right, of the right.
[01:13:28.947 --> 01:13:29.967]  We've all been taught that.
[01:13:30.527 --> 01:13:34.991]  That on the left you might have communism, but on the right you have fascism.
[01:13:34.991 --> 01:13:46.742]  And this lie is given some plausibility by the fact that Hitler and Stalin fought against each other in World War II, so it appears like they must be ideological opposites.
[01:13:47.422 --> 01:13:54.465]  But remember that Hitler and Stalin were allied at the beginning, until Hitler turned on Stalin.
[01:13:54.465 --> 01:13:58.486]  In reality, fascism and communism are not that far apart.
[01:13:58.486 --> 01:14:04.748]  Their battle is better understood like the battle between the Shia and the Sunni.
[01:14:04.748 --> 01:14:10.350]  Very bitter battle to be sure, but both operating from within the house of Islam.
[01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:15.812]  And so similarly, fascism and communism are two species of collectivism.
[01:14:16.412 --> 01:14:26.980]  Vying for power and the whole idea that fascism and Nazism are on the right, that's a big, big lie.
[01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:39.049]  I personally go out on the street now and I have leftists come over and tell me they want to physically attack me and just hiss and yell and say Russian spy or Nazi, just all these comical things.
[01:14:39.049 --> 01:14:43.412]  Don't they realize they're in black running around trying to bar people from speaking
[01:14:43.772 --> 01:14:45.572]  They're running around trying to intimidate people.
[01:14:45.572 --> 01:14:47.813]  They're telling us what language to use.
[01:14:47.813 --> 01:14:50.254]  They're telling us hyper-political correctness.
[01:14:50.254 --> 01:14:56.755]  They're teaching classical racism now in mainstream news with MTV shows about the problem of being white.
[01:14:56.755 --> 01:14:58.796]  I mean, it's just insanity.
[01:14:58.796 --> 01:15:06.838]  And I'm not giving the quote minorities a pass here, but it's mainly led by university professors and people that are white.
[01:15:07.658 --> 01:15:13.921]  But they're creating their new cadres to lead the minorities, who are the majority when you put them together, into this system.
[01:15:13.921 --> 01:15:21.244]  And they're saying Trump won because of inherent racism when it was the left that ran the campaign on a race-based system.
[01:15:22.970 --> 01:15:35.613]  Yes, not only is the left tactically fascist, not only are they using the sort of tactics of the Nazis, but they also have the ideology of the Nazis.
[01:15:35.613 --> 01:15:41.795]  Let's remember that Nazism and fascism were both variants of socialism.
[01:15:41.795 --> 01:15:43.455]  Hitler's party was called
[01:15:43.795 --> 01:15:46.097]  The National Socialist Party.
[01:15:46.097 --> 01:15:51.322]  The very word Nazi is putting together National and Socialista.
[01:15:51.322 --> 01:15:53.004]  That's where we get the sound Nazi.
[01:15:53.843 --> 01:15:55.764]  Mussolini was a Marxist.
[01:15:55.764 --> 01:15:59.286]  He was the leader of the Italian Socialist Party.
[01:15:59.286 --> 01:16:01.407]  He was recognized to be on the left.
[01:16:01.407 --> 01:16:03.488]  He saw himself as on the left.
[01:16:03.488 --> 01:16:09.490]  When Mussolini came to power, Lenin sent him a telegram of congratulations.
[01:16:09.490 --> 01:16:10.251]  Why?
[01:16:10.251 --> 01:16:15.133]  Because Lenin recognized that Mussolini was a fellow revolutionary of the left.
[01:16:15.613 --> 01:16:29.757]  So, what an incredible sleight of hand in which these leftists, whose political platform reads like it's right out of the Democratic Party platform... And by the way, Dinesh, this is something... You're absolutely right.
[01:16:29.757 --> 01:16:37.939]  This is something that leftists on universities say that we're lying about, and a real hot point for them because it's a fact the Nazis were National Socialists.
[01:16:37.939 --> 01:16:41.880]  It's a fact that he modeled himself after the fascistas in Italy.
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:43.321]  It's a fact they wore black.
[01:16:43.321 --> 01:16:44.621]  It's a fact they wore masks.
[01:16:44.881 --> 01:16:45.001]  It's
[01:16:59.838 --> 01:17:03.639]  For the first year of the war where they divided Poland amongst each other.
[01:17:03.639 --> 01:17:06.040]  So we had the Warsaw Pact.
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:17.185]  They hope that's not known that they are authoritarian and that socialism and fascism have different and left-right versions and that it was the American left
[01:17:17.605 --> 01:17:24.848]  That backed Hitler early on because he was a vegetarian and a bunch of other issues and he wanted planning of society.
[01:17:24.848 --> 01:17:29.851]  This is incontrovertible that the KKK was founded by the Democratic Party.
[01:17:29.851 --> 01:17:37.794]  It is incontrovertible that the Republicans passed the Civil Rights Act and took, you know, that system away from them and they panic.
[01:17:37.794 --> 01:17:44.818]  It is incontrovertible that the power structure got scared of American Christians and American Republicans and Eisenhower
[01:17:45.698 --> 01:17:51.783]  And created this whole new strategy to get everybody to go, oh, you're going to be liberal?
[01:17:51.783 --> 01:17:53.344]  You're going to be anti-racist?
[01:17:53.344 --> 01:18:05.675]  We'll take it over and make it extreme, own it, then double-cross you later and make everything race-based again, once whites have been taught to bow down as long as you say something's for racial equality.
[01:18:05.675 --> 01:18:14.202]  So they're using our goodness, our bigness, our Christian Western ethos that unifies, who deny the West is the most open, to then bring us down.
[01:18:16.089 --> 01:18:20.633]  Yes, I'll add to your list of incontrovertibles.
[01:18:20.633 --> 01:18:37.429]  It is incontrovertible, and I document this in the book, that Hitler got this specific blueprint for the Nuremberg Laws, the laws that discriminated against Jews, segregated them into ghettos, later confiscated their property, state-sponsored discrimination.
[01:18:37.429 --> 01:18:38.770]  These laws are not just
[01:18:39.230 --> 01:18:49.606]  You may say, and they're not just similar to the Jim Crow laws of the Democratic South, the Nazis actually used the blueprint of the Democratic laws.
[01:18:49.606 --> 01:18:52.009]  And Margaret Sanger.
[01:18:52.009 --> 01:18:52.510]  It's incredible.
[01:18:54.773 --> 01:18:55.293]  It's incredible.
[01:18:55.293 --> 01:18:56.334]  Your book documents it all.
[01:18:56.334 --> 01:19:00.836]  And Margaret Sanger, Hitler kept a book of hers signed by his bed.
[01:19:00.836 --> 01:19:02.717]  They wrote love letters to each other.
[01:19:02.717 --> 01:19:04.878]  The Rockefeller Foundation funded it all.
[01:19:04.878 --> 01:19:07.179]  The Rockefeller Foundation created the UN.
[01:19:07.179 --> 01:19:10.201]  The Rockefeller Foundation literally runs all this.
[01:19:10.201 --> 01:19:15.443]  So with your book, your research, your international skills, what is their master plan now?
[01:19:15.443 --> 01:19:20.126]  Because it's incontrovertible, a planned fascist society with no free speech,
[01:19:20.586 --> 01:19:27.369]  Getting everybody to fight with each other over racial identity, sexual identity, putting us all in our ghettos, controlled by a super state.
[01:19:27.369 --> 01:19:29.530]  Is that not the plan?
[01:19:29.530 --> 01:19:37.553]  Well, you know, we're obviously going to be under the accusation of exaggerating, of being paranoid.
[01:19:37.553 --> 01:19:40.094]  Dinesh, how can you use this term, fascist?
[01:19:40.094 --> 01:19:41.614]  Now, here's my point.
[01:19:41.614 --> 01:19:50.078]  If we actually look at the policies of Obama, the policies supported now by Elizabeth Warren and by Bernie,
[01:19:50.678 --> 01:19:51.899]  I want to raise a question.
[01:19:51.899 --> 01:19:59.321]  Are these economic policies more accurately called socialist in the Marxist sense or fascist?
[01:19:59.321 --> 01:20:06.284]  Remember that the core meaning of fascism in economic terms is state-run capitalism.
[01:20:07.204 --> 01:20:13.125]  And if you look at what the progressives are all about, they're not really pursuing socialism per se.
[01:20:13.125 --> 01:20:16.546]  The socialists in every country want to nationalize industry.
[01:20:16.546 --> 01:20:24.347]  They want the government to actually nationalize and own the energy sector, the banks, and so on.
[01:20:24.347 --> 01:20:30.629]  Obviously, we still have private hospitals, we have private insurance companies, but the government is telling them what to do.
[01:20:30.629 --> 01:20:32.149]  The government is setting prices.
[01:20:32.589 --> 01:20:37.252]  Under Obama, we've seen government regulation expand dramatically.
[01:20:37.252 --> 01:20:38.493]  It's a cult of power.
[01:20:38.493 --> 01:20:40.474]  They use social engineering against us.
[01:20:40.474 --> 01:20:43.496]  They use race to control us because they know how powerful it is.
[01:20:43.496 --> 01:20:48.198]  What do we do then when they're double-crossing the Christian ethos of bringing people together?
[01:20:48.198 --> 01:20:50.480]  They've used our strength against us.
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:50.920]  What do we do?
[01:20:51.854 --> 01:21:03.537]  So basically we need, and my last chapter is called denazification, and what that means is we've got to realize that we're actually facing a very bad bunch of guys who are willing to stop at nothing.
[01:21:03.537 --> 01:21:07.058]  We need knowledge and then we need courageous action.
[01:21:07.058 --> 01:21:08.418]  So the knowledge is in the book.
[01:21:08.418 --> 01:21:17.621]  It's going to equip you, it's going to help you to fire back and move fascism out of the right-wing column back into the left-wing column where it belongs.
[01:21:18.621 --> 01:21:20.482]  But knowledge is not enough.
[01:21:20.482 --> 01:21:26.944]  We've got to realize that we're dealing with people who are willing to break the law, who are willing to cause physical harm and destruction.
[01:21:26.944 --> 01:21:29.766]  We have to hold these people accountable.
[01:21:29.766 --> 01:21:38.569]  During the Civil War, when Abraham Lincoln found out that the Confederates were executing free blacks, he issued an order that he acknowledged was barbaric.
[01:21:38.949 --> 01:21:45.631]  He said, for every free black executed by the Confederacy, I am going to shoot one Confederate soldier.
[01:21:45.631 --> 01:21:51.812]  Now, he understood that this was very tough, but he realized, how else are we going to get these people to stop?
[01:21:51.812 --> 01:22:00.255]  I think we need to realize that we need to impose the law in a very tough way on these new fascists who are posing as anti-fascists.
[01:22:00.255 --> 01:22:02.155]  That's the only way to stop them.
[01:22:02.155 --> 01:22:05.616]  We need a new kind of Republican to actually carry this out.
[01:22:06.024 --> 01:22:10.305]  What do we do about the minorities that they have whipped?
[01:22:10.305 --> 01:22:19.688]  That's not really the most out-of-control group I've seen, but we see the racial attacks on whites, on others, on Asians, being killed, being beaten to death, the knockout game.
[01:22:19.688 --> 01:22:22.549]  It's in the news every day, but the media whitewashes it.
[01:22:22.549 --> 01:22:27.291]  Islamists are being brought into Europe, into here, the rape gangs, the cover-ups, the
[01:22:27.571 --> 01:22:30.594]  The left banning people that criticize radical Islam.
[01:22:30.594 --> 01:22:43.989]  I mean, they're really coming in with massive censorship right now, calling us the racists, saying censor us, and a lot of folks have fallen for the trap, going, we're not racists, don't censor us, instead of, hey, allow free speech on YouTube, on Google.
[01:22:44.830 --> 01:22:49.672]  On Facebook and on Twitter, because once you start censoring one group, you'll censor everybody.
[01:22:49.672 --> 01:22:55.073]  I think we're losing the debate here because we argue we're not racist, which is true, but they don't care.
[01:22:55.073 --> 01:22:59.455]  Once they set the precedent to ban racists, they have the precedent to ban their opposition.
[01:23:01.277 --> 01:23:07.703]  Yeah, the Democrats have always been the party of racial consciousness, of racial discrimination.
[01:23:07.703 --> 01:23:13.468]  And you might say that, in a sense, they're doing the same thing now, only in the opposite direction.
[01:23:13.468 --> 01:23:16.051]  They've created this kind of multicultural tent.
[01:23:16.791 --> 01:23:21.555]  They supposedly ask every group to affirm its racial identity.
[01:23:21.555 --> 01:23:24.357]  Hey blacks, you need to be proud of being black.
[01:23:24.357 --> 01:23:25.598]  Black is beautiful.
[01:23:25.598 --> 01:23:29.682]  Hey Asians, you've got to be proud of being Asian and so on, except whites.
[01:23:29.682 --> 01:23:35.827]  So there's a kind of exemption for whites and everybody is encouraged to gang up, you might say, on the whites.
[01:23:36.487 --> 01:23:39.951]  Naturally, this has created a volatile situation.
[01:23:39.951 --> 01:23:54.425]  This, I think, helps to explain why some sort of white nationalists go, Trump is our only hope, because they would normally be in the Democratic Party, but the Democratic Party has constructed itself in such a way that there's room for every kind of
[01:23:55.646 --> 01:23:58.508]  And I agree.
[01:23:58.508 --> 01:24:02.092]  And again, it's so cartoonish and it's standard procedure.
[01:24:02.092 --> 01:24:04.794]  It's not like the radicals or the Democrats are doing this.
[01:24:04.794 --> 01:24:05.815]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:24:05.815 --> 01:24:11.740]  They say we're losing and we're going to lose to this Republican idea, libertarian idea of economic empowerment.
[01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:30.405]  We've got to go to culture war and they talk about using race baiting and it's so cartoonish the stuff they're doing all over the news saying whites are inherently evil and having college courses about we must exterminate and get rid of whites and feminist magazines saying if you're white and have a white baby abort it.
[01:24:30.405 --> 01:24:32.046]  I mean this is cuckoo level!
[01:24:33.542 --> 01:24:34.423]  It completely is.
[01:24:34.423 --> 01:24:46.737]  And here we, I think we, I have to give Trump a little bit of credit because in my lifetime, he's the only president that I've seen who understands that he needs to fight not just a political war, but a culture war.
[01:24:46.737 --> 01:24:49.961]  And, you know, Reagan, whom I adore, I was a young Reaganite in the 80s.
[01:24:50.922 --> 01:24:54.744]  But Reagan's view was you can't change the world in 10 ways or 20 ways.
[01:24:54.744 --> 01:24:57.265]  You can change the world in maybe one or two ways.
[01:24:57.265 --> 01:24:59.445]  So Reagan focused on the Soviet Union.
[01:24:59.445 --> 01:25:02.867]  He focused on taxation and that's about it.
[01:25:02.867 --> 01:25:08.589]  But with Trump, here's a guy who's pulling us out of the trade pact and fighting to change Obamacare and he's
[01:25:08.949 --> 01:25:11.831]  Well, you say you gotta give him a little credit.
[01:25:11.831 --> 01:25:13.311]  I totally agree with you.
[01:25:13.311 --> 01:25:17.294]  Eric Trump has pointed out that he's tougher than the swamp creatures and is carrying the country on his back.
[01:25:17.294 --> 01:25:21.316]  How can you not marvel somebody that defeated the fake polls, defeated the rigged debates,
[01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:57.617]  Came from behind one big time and has now killed TPP, killed the carbon tax that was meant to literally de-industrialize us, gotten the stock market up $3 trillion despite the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, 69% reduction in illegals coming across the border according to Homeland Security now in just six months.
[01:25:57.617 --> 01:26:03.121]  I mean, it goes on and on and on, breaking the back of political correctness, getting a good Supreme Court justice in.
[01:26:03.121 --> 01:26:04.683]  Of course the deep state hates him.
[01:26:05.203 --> 01:26:09.187]  Because they'd conquered this country and now it's come back from the dead.
[01:26:09.187 --> 01:26:17.155]  It's unbelievable to see how so many in the Republican Party, they just don't get Trump.
[01:26:17.155 --> 01:26:19.758]  Or at least, they're scared of Trump.
[01:26:21.227 --> 01:26:26.408]  Part of it is that they worry Trump is going to blow up and blow them up with him.
[01:26:26.408 --> 01:26:33.049]  Part of it is that Trump acts in a way that is outside convention and this completely immobilizes them.
[01:26:33.049 --> 01:26:36.890]  And some of them are actively opposed to Trump.
[01:26:36.890 --> 01:26:40.611]  Sometimes I feel in the intellectual sphere, I'm almost all by myself.
[01:26:40.611 --> 01:26:45.812]  The conservative intelligentsia has turned away from Trump, if not against Trump.
[01:26:46.312 --> 01:26:49.956]  This, I think, is intellectual suicide on the part of our side.
[01:26:49.956 --> 01:26:54.321]  This is a time where if we come together, victory is totally in our grasp.
[01:26:54.321 --> 01:26:58.926]  We can push back this fascist strain in American culture.
[01:26:58.926 --> 01:27:05.033]  We have three branches of government to do it, and the left is pulling out all the stops.
[01:27:06.121 --> 01:27:12.769]  Well, a lot of these Republican establishment have been rhinos, Republican name only, as you know, and they have been there the whole time.
[01:27:12.769 --> 01:27:14.612]  They know they're in desperate straits.
[01:27:14.612 --> 01:27:15.913]  They want to be the ruling class.
[01:27:15.913 --> 01:27:19.598]  They don't want to send power back to the states and back to the people.
[01:27:19.598 --> 01:27:23.302]  So Jeff Flake comes out and says, I'm a globalist.
[01:27:23.302 --> 01:27:24.103]  I don't like Trump.
[01:27:25.285 --> 01:27:35.233]  And Democratic operatives, you know, on national TV like Stephanopoulos, celebrate the Republicans in the Senate turning their back on Trump like this is some defeat of Trump.
[01:27:35.233 --> 01:27:37.535]  They're the problem.
[01:27:37.535 --> 01:27:40.918]  They're the ones that helped write Obamacare to begin with.
[01:27:40.918 --> 01:27:42.920]  It's Trump getting rid of the scam.
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:46.243]  His failure to repeal it is their failure.
[01:27:46.243 --> 01:27:48.765]  And it just makes him more of a champion.
[01:27:48.765 --> 01:27:51.367]  We must target them in the upcoming midterms.
[01:27:51.367 --> 01:27:52.428]  We must punish them.
[01:27:52.828 --> 01:27:55.090]  Not look at Trumpism as a failure.
[01:27:55.090 --> 01:27:58.334]  As you said, victory is in our grasp.
[01:27:58.334 --> 01:28:03.459]  A global realignment is happening for nationalism, free market, and common sense.
[01:28:03.459 --> 01:28:04.640]  The tide is going out.
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:06.221]  The elites even admit that.
[01:28:06.221 --> 01:28:15.491]  And so they want to run this mind game on us, like National Review just wrote this big story saying, death of a salesman, that Trump's a total failure, always been a failure.
[01:28:16.191 --> 01:28:20.997]  The guy's the biggest, you know, dark horse winner in modern American politics.
[01:28:20.997 --> 01:28:29.626]  The guy is nothing but a success story, a titan of resistance, a titan of going up against peer pressure, a titan of breaking the elites back.
[01:28:30.848 --> 01:28:40.012]  You know, for a whole generation since Reagan, we've had these absolutely intellectually shallow, incoherent Republican leaders.
[01:28:40.012 --> 01:28:48.356]  And the whole conservative intelligentsia obediently lined up behind them, saluted what they did, even when it was abominably stupid.
[01:28:48.356 --> 01:28:51.378]  And now when Trump comes along, they go, he's not a conservative.
[01:28:51.738 --> 01:28:57.462]  He's acting in a more conservative way than George W. Bush, George H.W.
[01:28:57.462 --> 01:28:57.762]  Bush.
[01:28:57.762 --> 01:29:01.925]  He's certainly more conservative than McCain, let alone Bob Dole.
[01:29:01.925 --> 01:29:05.827]  So this is the most conservative president we've seen in a generation.
[01:29:07.188 --> 01:29:16.216]  For the life of me, I cannot understand why the Bill Crystals of the world and all these dudes are acting as if Trump is some kind of a liberal in disguise.
[01:29:16.216 --> 01:29:33.972]  Because they're weak-minded and they care about mainstream media and the cocktail parties because they're old, they're part of the old system, they don't understand their time has come and gone and obviously, Dash, you, you know, come from common folks, been successful on your own action just like myself and many others and we're together
[01:29:34.392 --> 01:29:42.559]  For a free market, for a future, for a system that is anti-racist, anti-tribal, and that is pro-human, going to the stars.
[01:29:42.559 --> 01:29:45.322]  The book is The Big Lie, bigliebook.com.
[01:29:45.322 --> 01:29:47.243]  Dinesh D'Souza, thanks for joining us.
[01:29:47.243 --> 01:29:49.665]  Look forward to having you back on again, my friend.
[01:29:49.665 --> 01:29:51.407]  Look forward to it.
[01:29:51.407 --> 01:29:52.928]  Powerful information.
[01:29:52.928 --> 01:29:54.870]  And we have another special guest joining us straight ahead.
[01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:59.093]  Empires on the run.
[01:29:59.093 --> 01:30:01.776]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:06.195 --> 01:30:17.262]  A staunch anti-federalist, Patrick Henry was opposed to the Constitution, fearing it would become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that had created it, but that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty.
[01:30:17.262 --> 01:30:20.243]  His warnings, ignored, have now come to pass.
[01:30:20.243 --> 01:30:28.828]  He said, you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased, nor how you are to become a great and powerful people, but how your liberties can be secured.
[01:30:28.828 --> 01:30:31.490]  For liberty ought to be the direct end of your government.
[01:30:31.730 --> 01:30:39.858]  Patrick Henry warned us, the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.
[01:30:39.858 --> 01:30:44.202]  Today, everything the government does, at every level, is concealed from us.
[01:30:44.202 --> 01:30:49.127]  We have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see.
[01:30:49.127 --> 01:30:55.113]  Later in life, Patrick Henry looked back and said, when the American spirit was in its youth, the language of America was different.
[01:30:55.353 --> 01:30:57.514]  Liberty, sir, was the primary object.
[01:30:57.514 --> 01:31:03.355]  Today, our primary concern is safety and comfort, when we should be demanding liberty.
[01:31:03.355 --> 01:31:06.276]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:31:06.276 --> 01:31:09.296]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[01:31:09.296 --> 01:31:13.497]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[01:31:13.497 --> 01:31:20.839]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[01:31:20.839 --> 01:31:23.960]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:44.739]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[01:31:44.739 --> 01:31:48.303]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[01:31:48.843 --> 01:32:00.076]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[01:32:00.076 --> 01:32:05.802]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[01:32:05.802 --> 01:32:10.127]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[01:32:10.447 --> 01:32:23.396]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[01:32:23.396 --> 01:32:29.961]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[01:32:29.961 --> 01:32:32.423]  And so I set out to develop caveman.
[01:32:32.483 --> 01:32:43.731]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[01:32:43.731 --> 01:32:46.072]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[01:32:46.072 --> 01:32:47.553]  We're getting results.
[01:32:47.553 --> 01:32:53.657]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[01:32:53.657 --> 01:32:56.539]  Caveman is finally back at the InfoWars store.
[01:32:56.539 --> 01:33:00.242]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only.
[01:33:00.302 --> 01:33:01.182]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:01.182 --> 01:33:04.624]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:33:32.931 --> 01:33:44.796]  Ladies and gentlemen, coming up at the start of the next hour, we have James Wesley Rawls popping in for 30 minutes, then Mark Goldman is also going to be joining us.
[01:33:44.796 --> 01:33:47.197]  We just had Dinesh D'Souza on.
[01:33:47.197 --> 01:33:51.999]  I want to get into some of the geopolitical news.
[01:33:51.999 --> 01:33:53.440]  I want to get into some of the tech news.
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:55.160]  It's really important.
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:34:00.863]  They've introduced legislation to not let your appliances spy on you with cameras and microphones.
[01:34:02.651 --> 01:34:06.433]  And yes, a lot of them have cameras and microphones built in, but that's only the beginning.
[01:34:06.433 --> 01:34:10.615]  They can dial into your other computers that do have cameras and microphones.
[01:34:10.615 --> 01:34:22.300]  So, your dishwasher doesn't have a camera and microphone, but it's got a digital antenna that will pick it up and then transmit it, get ready for this, off another antenna or down your power line.
[01:34:24.008 --> 01:34:25.829]  Data over power line.
[01:34:25.829 --> 01:34:27.510]  I told everybody this 20 plus years ago.
[01:34:27.510 --> 01:34:28.151]  They didn't believe me.
[01:34:28.151 --> 01:34:29.792]  I showed you all the documents.
[01:34:29.792 --> 01:34:31.773]  It's now mainstream news.
[01:34:31.773 --> 01:34:39.879]  And they have waited to tell you about this in the Hill newspaper until it's already in place.
[01:34:39.879 --> 01:34:49.285]  And that's an algorithm I've noticed where they only tell you about it once it's in place to then pass some regulations so only the government can do it.
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:56.563]  And then pose as the saviors over what they've designed on purpose.
[01:34:56.563 --> 01:35:07.387]  And I sit here and I watch this and I learn this and then decades later I read white papers saying exactly what I'd already said myself.
[01:35:07.387 --> 01:35:14.450]  Because once you learn their philosophy, once you learn their operations, you've got them down.
[01:35:14.450 --> 01:35:16.111]  They operate like you're an idiot.
[01:35:16.111 --> 01:35:17.812]  Remember Gruber?
[01:35:20.031 --> 01:35:29.498]  He said, thank God you're so stupid.
[01:35:29.498 --> 01:35:44.088]  Thank heaven you don't realize that Obamacare was written as a tax to private insurance companies to make the biggest profits they've ever made in the last five years.
[01:35:44.088 --> 01:35:47.150]  You wonder why the Republican leadership didn't shoot down Obamacare?
[01:35:47.150 --> 01:35:47.931]  Because they wrote it.
[01:35:50.748 --> 01:35:54.812]  And the Democrats run around giggling like, Trump loss, Trump loss, failure, failure.
[01:35:54.812 --> 01:35:59.836]  Ding dong, the witch is dead, the witch, oh witch, the witch, witch, witch.
[01:35:59.836 --> 01:36:02.299]  Ding dong, the wicked witch is dead.
[01:36:02.299 --> 01:36:13.249]  We represent the Lollipop Guild, the Lollipop Guild, the Lollipop Guild.
[01:36:13.249 --> 01:36:15.631]  We represent the Lollipop Guild.
[01:36:18.328 --> 01:36:24.101]  And I look at the Democrats and I go, you understand the Republican leadership wrote this to the Democrats and foreign banks to rape you.
[01:36:27.892 --> 01:36:30.053]  They go, thought you said it was insurance companies.
[01:36:30.053 --> 01:36:32.495]  And I went, that's who owns those, yes.
[01:36:32.495 --> 01:36:36.838]  Now you do understand they're ruthless and they wanted a corporate direct tax to them.
[01:36:36.838 --> 01:36:42.481]  That's what the carbon tax is and the wellhead and the digital tax, the Tobin tax.
[01:36:42.481 --> 01:36:45.864]  And they go, oh, talking fancy, trying to impress me.
[01:36:45.864 --> 01:36:47.865]  And I'm going, no, I'm your fellow human.
[01:36:47.865 --> 01:36:50.627]  I don't want to be a predator and join the elite and feed on you.
[01:36:51.690 --> 01:36:53.791]  Sure, you're trying to impress me.
[01:36:53.791 --> 01:36:57.572]  I'm like, no, I morally cannot do this to you.
[01:36:57.572 --> 01:37:03.294]  But instead of you just being fed on, you join the globalists to then help destroy me as well.
[01:37:03.294 --> 01:37:06.795]  So I really need you to wake up.
[01:37:06.795 --> 01:37:08.195]  But they don't care.
[01:37:08.195 --> 01:37:09.316]  They're delusional.
[01:37:09.316 --> 01:37:17.338]  People have been brought up in such an artificial world, they learn how to make believe.
[01:37:17.338 --> 01:37:18.759]  And the mental illness is getting worse.
[01:37:18.759 --> 01:37:19.839]  I see it in more and more people.
[01:37:20.967 --> 01:37:30.772]  Where they can't work, they can't do jobs, they just walk around like zombies, and they just fantasize about how big and powerful they are.
[01:37:30.772 --> 01:37:38.315]  And the mental illness is just exploding, society is disintegrating.
[01:37:38.315 --> 01:37:49.081]  And then like giant zombie hordes, with all their tics and all their weirdnesses and all their bizarre behaviors, the swarms of dysfunctional
[01:37:50.146 --> 01:37:56.329]  Are just rising up like a plague.
[01:37:56.329 --> 01:38:06.112]  And they click and they cluck and they jibber and they just look completely mentally ill.
[01:38:06.112 --> 01:38:17.017]  But the computers and the robots and the automation keep producing them the food and the producing humans keep producing them a culture that they can then walk around on and judge and get mad at and demand things.
[01:38:18.285 --> 01:38:18.845]  I don't know.
[01:38:45.387 --> 01:38:48.629]  Millennials are entitled, narcissistic, and lazy.
[01:38:48.629 --> 01:38:50.270]  But it's not their fault.
[01:38:50.270 --> 01:38:56.595]  Expert claims every child wins a prize and social media has left Generation Y unable to deal with the real world.
[01:38:56.595 --> 01:39:04.340]  And they all fantasize that they are this ascendant super being that knows everything and is smarter than everyone.
[01:39:10.731 --> 01:39:18.824]  And they're fine to be around until they stub their toe, or until they get a flat tire, or until everything doesn't go just the way they want.
[01:39:18.824 --> 01:39:21.509]  And it's like being around a cult, or studying a cult.
[01:39:22.401 --> 01:39:25.803]  You watch old videos of those ashrams and new age cults and stuff.
[01:39:25.803 --> 01:39:27.183]  Everyone's like, it's beautiful!
[01:39:27.183 --> 01:39:28.324]  We're all enlightened!
[01:39:28.324 --> 01:39:30.985]  Oh, it's so perfect!
[01:39:30.985 --> 01:39:39.069]  Yeah, you're in the cult while you drain mama and daddy's bank account while they're begging you to come back from California or come back from India or come back from wherever.
[01:39:39.069 --> 01:39:42.971]  And you're there on a beautiful piece of property having free love.
[01:39:42.971 --> 01:39:48.554]  But as soon as all that runs out or you get pregnant, then you get put to work in the kitchen.
[01:39:49.824 --> 01:39:53.408]  Your child gets taken away and is turned into a brainwashing servant.
[01:39:53.408 --> 01:40:06.540]  And that's what all this is, is a giant cult with cult programmers like Schmidt and Zuckerberg and all of them sitting back in their own manuals and own memos, because they don't care if you learn about it.
[01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:11.045]  They think you're an animal saying, these scum, these dumb effers, when do we exterminate them?
[01:40:12.335 --> 01:40:20.042]  Well, the bioweapons tend to leach into general population, even though we've got immunogenic blockers that will protect most of us.
[01:40:20.042 --> 01:40:28.070]  There's so many humans that with 7.5 billion, if you wipe out, say, 6 billion, there'll be so much rioting and killing, it'll bring down civilization.
[01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:29.512]  So the answer is the soft kill.
[01:40:30.592 --> 01:40:40.356]  With the wavelengths projected to the television and through other systems, we can get them into a trance state and just slowly raise the level of cancer, neurological disorders.
[01:40:40.356 --> 01:40:42.837]  We'll make everybody that gets the disorders rock stars.
[01:40:42.837 --> 01:40:44.418]  There'll be lots of fundraisers for them.
[01:40:44.418 --> 01:40:48.540]  We'll give them participation medals for their death.
[01:40:48.540 --> 01:40:56.063]  And then we'll just build that into the function and start phasing in the rollout of extermination, which we're now about 30 years into.
[01:40:57.799 --> 01:41:01.582]  So loving, so liberal, so trendy.
[01:41:01.582 --> 01:41:10.672]  And then the trendies tune in, and they hear it, they just make a big joke out of it, and they have John Oliver make jokes about it.
[01:41:10.672 --> 01:41:13.355]  You notice most of these globalist operatives are not having kids.
[01:41:14.531 --> 01:41:23.695]  Because they understand the world and the future is so hellish they're building and they're so selfish they believe they're going to merge with machines and become gods.
[01:41:23.695 --> 01:41:27.077]  And all they are is an earlier version of the Millennials.
[01:41:27.077 --> 01:41:35.181]  Super selfish, super empty, believing they're gods because they can envision human potential and what they could become
[01:41:35.441 --> 01:41:53.066]  But instead of understanding it's through being honest and good and focused and strong and going through persecution that you become transcendent and get a greater connection with God, they believe just because they can imagine the potential that they are that potential.
[01:41:53.066 --> 01:41:57.067]  And that they have realized that potential when they are fallen.
[01:41:59.462 --> 01:42:02.143]  And I don't say fallen, because the Bible said so.
[01:42:02.143 --> 01:42:12.429]  I can look at these globalists, and look at their fruits, and look at their minions, and look at them, and I can tell you, I don't want to be that elite.
[01:42:12.429 --> 01:42:14.390]  That elite.
[01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:15.671]  They are not the elite.
[01:42:15.671 --> 01:42:17.952]  They are the elite of insanity.
[01:42:17.952 --> 01:42:19.553]  The elite of unhappiness.
[01:42:19.553 --> 01:42:27.537]  The elite of stampeding around, trying to trample others, trying to find ascension.
[01:42:27.537 --> 01:42:29.038]  They are desperately scared.
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:40.386]  And they will be torn to shreds.
[01:42:40.386 --> 01:42:56.856]  The delusional system is going to get worse and worse and worse as people buy into the matrix, as they buy into the false reality, as they buy into the bots, as they buy into all of it, and then are blasted out into oblivion.
[01:42:56.856 --> 01:42:59.038]  Their consciousness rendered down
[01:43:01.786 --> 01:43:03.849]  Destroyed.
[01:43:03.849 --> 01:43:08.514]  And if you want to go down that path, then so be it.
[01:43:08.514 --> 01:43:13.220]  But at least you consciously have been warned up front.
[01:43:13.220 --> 01:43:19.248]  Now, before going any further, let's go to this piece of
[01:43:21.127 --> 01:43:22.968]  Eric Trump on Sean Hannity.
[01:43:22.968 --> 01:43:23.909]  Is Sean Hannity perfect?
[01:43:23.909 --> 01:43:24.649]  Is Eric Trump perfect?
[01:43:24.649 --> 01:43:25.189]  No.
[01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:31.993]  But the entire evil globalist system that's anti-human and wants a world where humans are obsolete hates them.
[01:43:31.993 --> 01:43:37.556]  Because they may be misguided in some cases, but they really do want prosperity.
[01:43:37.556 --> 01:43:43.380]  They really do get upset about the war on humanity, the war on families, the war on goodness.
[01:43:44.738 --> 01:43:56.330]  And because they prize success and goodness and strength and wealth generated by work, they are abhorred.
[01:43:56.330 --> 01:43:59.714]  They absolutely are hated by the system.
[01:44:01.109 --> 01:44:03.491]  And yes, you can only admire Trump.
[01:44:03.491 --> 01:44:10.436]  People revel in being on both sides of the fence and telling some people they hate Trump and other people they love Trump.
[01:44:10.436 --> 01:44:11.157]  Oh, do you like Trump?
[01:44:11.157 --> 01:44:12.338]  Oh, I like Trump too.
[01:44:12.338 --> 01:44:13.799]  Do you hate Trump?
[01:44:13.799 --> 01:44:15.140]  Oh, I hate him too.
[01:44:15.140 --> 01:44:19.223]  As if that's winning and getting you popular being no one.
[01:44:19.223 --> 01:44:24.767]  Playing games with other fake people that just virtue signal.
[01:44:24.767 --> 01:44:28.931]  Leadership is doing the right thing, standing up for what you believe in,
[01:44:29.878 --> 01:44:33.140]  And then moving forward.
[01:44:33.140 --> 01:44:39.625]  People today think social climbing, going along with the establishment, that somehow that gets you ahead.
[01:44:39.625 --> 01:44:42.307]  All you're giving up is your innate consciousness.
[01:44:42.307 --> 01:44:46.030]  All you're giving up is your innate imprint on the universe and the world.
[01:44:46.030 --> 01:44:49.492]  You're becoming a programmable bot.
[01:44:49.492 --> 01:44:53.235]  So that other men can live, and so you can sleep.
[01:44:53.235 --> 01:44:56.037]  Sleep your way into spiritual death.
[01:45:00.046 --> 01:45:02.607]  Sleep your way into not being conscious.
[01:45:02.607 --> 01:45:27.397]  Sleep your way into signing a contract to be mesmerized by the siren song of the deception of this world to then agree to subligate yourself and submit yourself to the most low, disastrous, fake, wicked, twisted, hungry evil the universe has ever seen.
[01:45:27.397 --> 01:45:29.018]  Soul-sucking!
[01:45:30.026 --> 01:45:37.071]  In love with it!
[01:45:37.071 --> 01:45:37.732]  Here's Eric Trump.
[01:45:37.732 --> 01:45:39.633]  The media doesn't want to talk about it.
[01:45:39.633 --> 01:45:40.254]  You talk about it.
[01:45:40.254 --> 01:45:41.395]  The media doesn't want to talk about it.
[01:45:41.395 --> 01:45:47.699]  But you would think they would get on the bandwagon of, what, we have a stock market that's 100 points off of a record.
[01:45:47.699 --> 01:45:47.999]  22,000.
[01:45:47.999 --> 01:45:49.741]  It's already a record.
[01:45:49.741 --> 01:45:50.882]  It broke another record.
[01:45:50.882 --> 01:45:51.282]  That's true.
[01:45:51.282 --> 01:45:54.264]  He's broken 30 records in the last, you know, three, four months.
[01:45:54.264 --> 01:45:55.885]  I mean, it's just skyrocketing.
[01:45:55.885 --> 01:45:58.807]  You look at oil prices and how good that is, right, for this.
[01:45:59.848 --> 01:46:00.148]  I think so.
[01:46:22.574 --> 01:46:23.074]  We're good.
[01:46:38.439 --> 01:46:39.540]  I mean, where is that?
[01:46:39.540 --> 01:46:40.941]  And the deficit's going down.
[01:46:55.752 --> 01:47:17.319]  And the things that your father made, the promises on the campaign trail he's kept, but not only that, they've allowed this phony Russian narrative to go out for so long, but yet we've got Ukraine collusion, we got Uranium One, we got the email server scandal which we know laws were broken, you got Comey leaking, the general counsel we learned of the FBI last week is leaking, Loretta Lynch
[01:47:17.979 --> 01:47:18.339]  They're cowards.
[01:47:40.999 --> 01:47:43.141]  I mean, I want somebody to start fighting for him.
[01:47:43.141 --> 01:47:44.863]  He's the best fighter in the world.
[01:47:44.863 --> 01:47:48.747]  He will do a better job fighting for himself than all of them will do fighting for him.
[01:47:48.747 --> 01:47:52.390]  But, I mean, how much weight does he have to carry by himself?
[01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:59.497]  How can a party that is doing so much better than the Democrats, if you look at how much more money the Republicans are raising, you look at the complete shambles
[01:48:04.694 --> 01:48:10.699]  It's because they're putting out fake polls and the globalists picked the Republicans they ran the last 30-40 years to be the most empty social climbing nobodies.
[01:48:30.137 --> 01:48:35.281]  And so they're all up there in the power structure, and they don't like the fact that Trump's taking it away from them.
[01:48:35.281 --> 01:48:42.307]  And given the general public prosperity, they want to run it and control it, even if they're running it in the ground.
[01:48:42.307 --> 01:48:43.008]  They're globalists.
[01:48:44.383 --> 01:48:50.748]  And so I see Trump carrying the country on his back with our listeners, and that's why they're trying to shoot down InfoWars.
[01:48:50.748 --> 01:48:52.269]  It's why they're trying to demoralize you.
[01:48:52.269 --> 01:48:57.593]  It's why they're trying to tell you that we're losers or we're bad, because we are saving the country.
[01:48:57.593 --> 01:49:00.475]  You, the listeners, are the heart of this.
[01:49:00.475 --> 01:49:01.976]  And Trump is delivering.
[01:49:01.976 --> 01:49:02.817]  It's insane.
[01:49:05.362 --> 01:49:06.984]  And now they're saying they want to kill him.
[01:49:06.984 --> 01:49:08.165]  They want to remove him.
[01:49:08.165 --> 01:49:09.506]  They're trying to organize that.
[01:49:09.506 --> 01:49:14.251]  And we're just calmly sitting here reporting on it because it's so radical.
[01:49:14.251 --> 01:49:17.434]  How do you even report on something that crazy?
[01:49:17.434 --> 01:49:19.596]  It makes you sound crazy.
[01:49:19.596 --> 01:49:20.477]  But it's not.
[01:49:20.477 --> 01:49:21.358]  It's happening.
[01:49:21.358 --> 01:49:25.742]  We'll play the rest on the other side, but I need you to spread InfoWars.com.
[01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:30.662]  I need you to share our photos that are on our Instagram.
[01:49:30.662 --> 01:49:35.084]  I need you to share our videos, our articles, everything, like it's a war.
[01:49:35.084 --> 01:49:43.387]  This Cy Hirsch report, the most respected journalist in the world, a liberal, meeting with the FBI, meeting with the NSA, meeting with ambassadors.
[01:49:43.387 --> 01:49:46.048]  They were tracking Seth Rich.
[01:49:46.048 --> 01:49:48.569]  He's the Wikileaker, not the Russians.
[01:49:48.569 --> 01:49:49.750]  That's bombshell.
[01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:51.371]  Infowars.com.
[01:49:51.371 --> 01:49:53.492]  Zero coverage of that.
[01:49:53.492 --> 01:49:54.772]  You will get around that.
[01:49:54.772 --> 01:49:56.293]  You will get it out to talk show hosts.
[01:49:57.580 --> 01:49:58.420]  You will get it out.
[01:49:58.420 --> 01:49:59.841]  You will show the interest.
[01:49:59.841 --> 01:50:01.021]  You will set the narrative.
[01:50:01.021 --> 01:50:02.962]  That's what they hate.

[01:51:37.187 --> 01:51:39.048]  A real zinc shortage is upon us.
[01:51:39.048 --> 01:51:47.132]  The Wall Street Journal says zinc supplies are down to three weeks, mine supplies struggling to meet demand, and no major discoveries in the last 22 years.
[01:51:47.132 --> 01:51:48.273]  What's it mean for you?
[01:51:48.273 --> 01:51:54.076]  Keith Neumeyer, who's made hundreds of millions investing in hard asset mining plays, is making his biggest call yet.

[01:52:05.290 --> 01:52:06.190]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:52:06.190 --> 01:52:08.571]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:52:08.571 --> 01:52:16.612]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?

[01:52:34.995 --> 01:52:44.561]  You want to save money in a place that gives you growth, control, and certainty without stock market risk or tax risk, and you want guarantees and you want it all tax-free.
[01:52:44.561 --> 01:52:45.762]  That's a tall order.
[01:52:45.762 --> 01:52:50.505]  But you can get all of that with properly designed participating whole life insurance.
[01:52:50.505 --> 01:52:53.367]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[01:52:53.367 --> 01:52:54.188]  That's true.
[01:52:54.188 --> 01:52:58.711]  But you can have tax-free access to use your life insurance while you're alive.

[01:53:05.935 --> 01:53:07.736]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:53:07.736 --> 01:53:09.396]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:53:09.396 --> 01:53:12.217]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.

[01:53:14.517 --> 01:53:19.018]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[01:53:36.166 --> 01:53:39.387]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.

[01:53:40.988 --> 01:53:43.808]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.

[01:53:53.911 --> 01:53:55.351]  Or warm and served.

[01:53:57.391 --> 01:53:59.332]  10-year shelf life bacon.

[01:54:07.623 --> 01:54:09.404]  Campbell's for the DNC
[01:54:23.268 --> 01:54:28.730]  Republicans are raising seven times on a monthly basis what the DNC... Look, why wouldn't they embrace that?
[01:54:28.730 --> 01:54:32.352]  Why wouldn't they carry out... My father has the voice of this country.
[01:54:32.352 --> 01:54:34.553]  The people of this country love him.
[01:54:34.553 --> 01:54:35.693]  Why wouldn't they get in line?
[01:54:35.693 --> 01:54:40.735]  It doesn't make sense, especially... Keeping promises is good politics, Eric.
[01:54:40.735 --> 01:54:41.516]  That's right.
[01:54:41.516 --> 01:54:48.119]  You want to raise money, you want to do well, you want to get re-elected, how about you build the wall... But Sean, especially for a fundamentally poor place...
[01:54:51.713 --> 01:54:51.934]  I don't
[01:55:09.104 --> 01:55:09.564]  This is a total...
[01:55:31.027 --> 01:55:33.648]  And complete act of mind control.
[01:55:33.648 --> 01:55:36.289]  With their fake polls, just like the campaign.
[01:55:36.289 --> 01:55:39.629]  With the Republican leadership trying to block Trump at every level.
[01:55:39.629 --> 01:55:42.730]  As they're raising the most money they've ever raised.
[01:55:42.730 --> 01:55:46.491]  Republicans are winning all across the United States.
[01:55:46.491 --> 01:55:48.732]  The grassroots Republicans are thanking Trump.
[01:55:48.732 --> 01:55:52.693]  They're thanking Infowars.
[01:55:52.693 --> 01:55:56.094]  But other folks are hedging their bets.
[01:55:56.094 --> 01:55:58.775]  Because they are preparing to try to assassinate the President.
[01:56:00.433 --> 01:56:05.177]  And they still have big parts of the bureaucracy, and people are scared.
[01:56:05.177 --> 01:56:07.479]  They're scared of the CIA.
[01:56:07.479 --> 01:56:17.787]  They're scared of military special forces and all the different embedded hit teams that are in every town and city in the United States.
[01:56:17.787 --> 01:56:24.773]  The naivete of the American people's gone to that, and they think if Deep State is able to take over again, they're going to come after everybody.
[01:56:24.773 --> 01:56:26.954]  We all better keep our heads down.
[01:56:26.954 --> 01:56:29.757]  You're going to lose everything if you act like that, folks.
[01:56:31.991 --> 01:56:34.874]  And they've been intimidating and they've been threatening Congress.
[01:56:34.874 --> 01:56:37.116]  And most of these congressmen aren't men.
[01:56:37.116 --> 01:56:39.418]  They get in line.
[01:56:39.418 --> 01:56:43.382]  But the saddest people are the Democrats.
[01:56:43.382 --> 01:56:50.770]  The Republican scum wrote Obamacare and you're defending it because you want Trump to fail when it's a huge screw job.
[01:56:50.770 --> 01:56:52.652]  What type of idiots are you?
[01:56:55.762 --> 01:57:03.129]  But again, they added 9 and 15 points on average, that was the two they would do, more Democrats to the polls.
[01:57:03.129 --> 01:57:04.230]  They admitted that.
[01:57:04.230 --> 01:57:05.231]  But some had 20%, 25%, 30%.
[01:57:05.231 --> 01:57:08.474]  I've told you, I've seen 34 points in CNN methodology added for Hillary.
[01:57:08.474 --> 01:57:08.514]  34!
[01:57:08.514 --> 01:57:12.518]  So when you see him in the polls at 38 or whatever,
[01:57:19.605 --> 01:57:37.232]  Know that the bots and the corporate numbers and the likeability numbers, despite all the censorship and the rest of it to try to dampen this down and them unliking Trump tweets and all the rest of it, which they admit they're doing, he's still at close to 60% with quote, likely voters.
[01:57:37.232 --> 01:57:39.133]  Well, of course he is.
[01:57:39.133 --> 01:57:41.294]  You see, they're not fixing the polls on immigration.
[01:57:41.294 --> 01:57:42.314]  It's like 75, 80% don't want open borders.
[01:57:42.314 --> 01:57:43.515]  It's 65% of Hispanics don't want open borders.
[01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:49.862]  We're trying to make it a Hispanic issue.
[01:57:49.862 --> 01:57:52.584]  Biggest group is Chinese women coming in to have their babies for free.
[01:57:52.584 --> 01:57:55.287]  Yes, that outpaces all Mexicans.
[01:57:55.287 --> 01:57:57.629]  Chinese women coming to have their babies for free.
[01:57:57.629 --> 01:57:58.851]  And who could blame them?
[01:57:58.851 --> 01:58:02.494]  I mean, if you go to China and have your baby for free and get great health care, would you?
[01:58:02.494 --> 01:58:03.435]  I'd go to China, maybe.
[01:58:03.435 --> 01:58:06.538]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[01:58:06.538 --> 01:58:09.761]  But remember, reliable AI systems predict Trump would win.
[01:58:10.782 --> 01:58:13.283]  Daily Presidential Poll, though, says, oh, he's in trouble.
[01:58:13.283 --> 01:58:17.425]  Artificial Intelligence System that correctly predicted the last three elections says Trump will win.
[01:58:17.425 --> 01:58:22.368]  And all those same systems show him that 60% of likely voters.
[01:58:24.178 --> 01:58:28.582]  Let's see, they've got demographics they can target, phone numbers they can target, where they can get help.
[01:58:28.582 --> 01:58:34.466]  They might say Trump's got 2% support soon, thinking you're weak-minded and will buy into peer pressure.
[01:58:34.466 --> 01:58:36.168]  Because God forbid you get a job.
[01:58:36.168 --> 01:58:37.969]  God forbid we pay off the national debt.
[01:58:37.969 --> 01:58:39.470]  God forbid we secure our borders.
[01:58:39.470 --> 01:58:41.552]  God forbid the stock market adds $4 trillion.
[01:58:42.918 --> 01:58:44.199]  Please financially support us.
[01:58:44.199 --> 01:58:45.179]  We got great products.

[01:58:56.383 --> 01:59:03.489]  As most of you know, more than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[01:59:03.489 --> 01:59:16.280]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:20.141]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[01:59:20.141 --> 01:59:27.104]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:59:27.104 --> 01:59:39.988]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[01:59:39.988 --> 01:59:41.529]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[01:59:41.829 --> 01:59:48.214]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[01:59:48.214 --> 01:59:53.138]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3138.
[01:59:53.138 --> 01:59:54.659]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:20.939 --> 02:00:24.122]  We got Joe Arpaio's lawyer exclusively joining us.
[02:00:24.122 --> 02:00:27.304]  He just got found guilty of contempt.
[02:00:27.304 --> 02:00:33.769]  Defending our sovereignty.
[02:00:33.769 --> 02:00:35.871]  We've got a ton of other news to get to.
[02:00:35.871 --> 02:00:38.013]  More info on Messiah Hearst breaking news.
[02:00:38.013 --> 02:00:39.074]  The leaker discovered.
[02:00:40.322 --> 02:00:42.143]  Who leaked from the DNC?
[02:00:42.143 --> 02:00:44.065]  Surprise, surprise, it's Seth Rich.
[02:00:44.065 --> 02:00:46.207]  My story's on InfoWars.com.
[02:00:46.207 --> 02:00:47.007]  It's all coming up.
[02:00:47.007 --> 02:00:52.852]  Massive Google censorship launched against pastors, against preachers, against you name it.
[02:00:52.852 --> 02:00:58.296]  But first, I want to go to a powerful report dealing with companies promoting microchipping.
[02:00:58.296 --> 02:01:01.119]  And it turns out they did get the microchip over the weekend.
[02:01:01.119 --> 02:01:05.382]  Got an article showing them bleeding, all the rest of it, from this PR firm.
[02:01:05.382 --> 02:01:08.525]  But here it is, Margaret the Beast getting pushed right here in America.
[02:01:10.073 --> 02:01:15.799]  A woman in Australia is now a combo of Darth Vader and the Terminator, thanks to some special implants.
[02:01:15.799 --> 02:01:18.082]  Here's an x-ray of her hands.
[02:01:18.082 --> 02:01:19.944]  Those circles are microchips.
[02:01:19.944 --> 02:01:24.148]  They allow her to unlock doors without using a key.
[02:01:24.148 --> 02:01:26.210]  Kind of like the Force.
[02:01:26.210 --> 02:01:29.594]  She can also access her computer without a password.
[02:01:32.035 --> 02:01:33.696]  Problem solved.
[02:01:33.696 --> 02:01:40.060]  Many things start off with the best of intentions, but sometimes intentions turn.
[02:01:40.060 --> 02:01:44.863]  We've survived thousands of years as a species without being microchipped.
[02:01:44.863 --> 02:01:47.024]  Is there any particular need to do it now?
[02:01:47.024 --> 02:01:54.428]  Approximately 50 employees at Three Square Market, a vending machine technology company based in River Falls, Wisconsin,
[02:01:54.628 --> 02:02:06.972]  ...have decided to ignore the Book of Revelation's eugenics, the existence of the New World Order, and common sense to gleefully act as guinea pigs for the acceptance of microchip technology.
[02:02:06.972 --> 02:02:14.754]  CNET proudly reports employees of ThreeSquare won't have to worry about forgetting their employee ID cards at home anymore.
[02:02:15.074 --> 02:02:24.296]  Starting next month, a voluntary program will offer company employees the chance to get an RFID chip implanted in their hands.
[02:02:24.296 --> 02:02:39.780]  The tiny chips will use NFC near-field communication technology to allow employees to unlock doors, make vending machine purchases, log into computers, and access office tools like photocopiers, all with the wave of the hand.
[02:02:40.060 --> 02:02:43.182]  What did the employees say when you brought this idea to them?
[02:02:43.182 --> 02:02:46.183]  Half of them actually within five seconds says yes.
[02:02:46.183 --> 02:03:01.230]  What CNET doesn't tell you is that how long before one of the female employees has a chip implanted resulting in a terminated pregnancy or employees are remotely vaccinated in order to test eugenicist Bill Gates' goals.
[02:03:01.230 --> 02:03:05.772]  But that's called the death panel and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[02:03:05.772 --> 02:03:07.333]  This equation has four factors.
[02:03:07.973 --> 02:03:09.773]  A little bit of multiplication.
[02:03:09.773 --> 02:03:13.594]  So you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero.
[02:03:13.594 --> 02:03:27.438]  And that's going to be based on the number of people, the services each person's using on average, the energy on average for each service, and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.
[02:03:27.438 --> 02:03:32.939]  So let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero.
[02:03:32.939 --> 02:03:35.900]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
[02:03:37.057 --> 02:03:39.520]  That's back from high school algebra.
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:41.742]  But let's take a look.
[02:03:41.742 --> 02:03:44.005]  First, we've got population.
[02:03:44.005 --> 02:03:46.708]  The world today has 6.8 billion people.
[02:03:46.708 --> 02:03:48.910]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[02:03:48.910 --> 02:03:57.139]  Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, healthcare, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[02:03:58.300 --> 02:04:05.922]  The BBC reports a contraceptive computer chip that can be controlled by remote control has been developed in Massachusetts.
[02:04:05.922 --> 02:04:11.784]  The chip is implanted under a woman's skin releasing a small dose of levonorgestrel, a hormone.
[02:04:11.784 --> 02:04:18.205]  The project has been backed by Bill Gates and will be submitted for pre-clinical testing in the U.S.
[02:04:18.205 --> 02:04:20.986]  next year and possibly go on sale by 2018.
[02:04:20.986 --> 02:04:25.207]  The same technology could be used to administer other drugs.
[02:04:25.247 --> 02:04:26.308]  We're good to go.
[02:04:44.619 --> 02:04:47.740]  Which already has many chipped employees.
[02:04:47.740 --> 02:04:49.061]  Yeah, Wisconsin.
[02:04:49.061 --> 02:04:54.943]  Follow the lead from Socialist Replacement Migration Doormat of the West suite.
[02:04:54.943 --> 02:05:03.006]  Just another example of how the left will take itself down simply to prove an inevitable inhumane globalist failure.
[02:05:03.006 --> 02:05:06.087]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.com
[02:05:06.778 --> 02:05:17.747]  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:05:17.747 --> 02:05:24.793]  That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
[02:05:24.793 --> 02:05:33.941]  That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government.
[02:05:35.572 --> 02:05:37.373]  Independence isn't a day.
[02:05:37.373 --> 02:05:38.414]  It's a mindset.
[02:05:38.414 --> 02:05:41.176]  An attitude that says, I will not be your dependent.
[02:05:41.176 --> 02:05:42.797]  I will not be your slave.
[02:05:42.797 --> 02:05:48.861]  Dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual infringements.
[02:05:48.861 --> 02:05:53.804]  When you trade your liberty for safety, to that extent, you become their slave.
[02:05:53.804 --> 02:05:55.706]  Slaves are never safe.
[02:05:55.706 --> 02:05:58.708]  You won't get rich by being a slave.
[02:05:58.708 --> 02:05:59.788]  Guard your liberty.
[02:05:59.788 --> 02:06:03.090]  Regard with suspicion anyone who tries to take it.
[02:06:03.090 --> 02:06:05.032]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:06:06.272 --> 02:06:10.933]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[02:06:10.933 --> 02:06:23.876]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[02:06:23.876 --> 02:06:30.457]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[02:06:30.457 --> 02:06:32.898]  And so I set out to develop caveman.
[02:06:32.978 --> 02:06:44.203]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[02:06:44.203 --> 02:06:46.564]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.

[02:08:20.058 --> 02:08:23.980]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:32.310 --> 02:08:36.531]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are fighting the Babylon system of the globalists.
[02:08:36.531 --> 02:08:38.011]  One world government.
[02:08:38.011 --> 02:08:40.112]  Open announcements of companies from Europe to the U.S.
[02:08:40.112 --> 02:08:43.793]  making you get microchips to basically work there.
[02:08:43.793 --> 02:08:49.514]  James Leslie Rawls, formerly of Army Intelligence, best-selling author, researcher, heads up the biggest survival blog out there.
[02:08:49.514 --> 02:08:52.195]  Survivalblog.com is our guest the next 30 minutes.
[02:08:52.195 --> 02:08:55.756]  And we have Sheriff Arpaio's lawyer joining us exclusively.
[02:08:56.758 --> 02:09:02.051]  Sheriff Arpaio has been found guilty in federal court of contempt.
[02:09:03.496 --> 02:09:07.177]  We just had Dinesh D'Souza on who was put in prison for nine months for no reason.
[02:09:07.177 --> 02:09:09.238]  Now they want me put in prison.
[02:09:09.238 --> 02:09:13.820]  He's put out the book, The Big Lie, exposing the Nazi roots of the American left.
[02:09:13.820 --> 02:09:15.681]  I mean, they are the fascists.
[02:09:15.681 --> 02:09:17.541]  They call themselves the anti-fascists.
[02:09:17.541 --> 02:09:19.622]  These people mean business.
[02:09:19.622 --> 02:09:23.143]  We're going to James Wesley Rawls here in just a moment.
[02:09:23.143 --> 02:09:25.864]  The anti-threat spirals.
[02:09:25.864 --> 02:09:32.267]  Some safe predictions of the coming unsafe era by James Wesley Rawls coming up here in just a moment.
[02:09:33.234 --> 02:09:39.496]  But before I do that, the most important thing to understand is this is an illusion that Trump's poll numbers are down.
[02:09:39.496 --> 02:09:51.581]  The scientific polls, the blogs, the bots, the AI systems, just like in the campaign show him at 60% conservatively of likely voters.
[02:09:51.581 --> 02:09:54.542]  They're just panicking because the Democrats are imploding.
[02:09:54.542 --> 02:09:58.744]  They're catching the illegals and people voting in dead people's names everywhere.
[02:09:58.744 --> 02:10:00.905]  His election commission is documenting all this.
[02:10:01.837 --> 02:10:03.318]  Their whole system is in crisis.
[02:10:03.318 --> 02:10:06.301]  The border is becoming secured, the economy is coming back.
[02:10:06.301 --> 02:10:11.446]  That's why the Republican leadership is turning against Trump, because they were put in there by the globalists.
[02:10:11.446 --> 02:10:16.991]  McCain said he'd vote against Obamacare, and he'd vote to repeal it, and he didn't.
[02:10:16.991 --> 02:10:21.576]  This is a bunch of scum realizing they're in great crisis, and it's also important
[02:10:22.588 --> 02:10:24.388]  To realize we're in the thick of battle.
[02:10:24.388 --> 02:10:25.309]  Spread the articles.
[02:10:25.309 --> 02:10:26.209]  Spread the videos.
[02:10:26.209 --> 02:10:29.009]  Spread our tweets at Real Alex Jones.
[02:10:29.009 --> 02:10:32.050]  Spread the archives of videos we put up each day.
[02:10:32.050 --> 02:10:33.030]  It's a war.
[02:10:33.030 --> 02:10:38.171]  You may already know all this, but the public is more hungry than ever.
[02:10:38.171 --> 02:10:39.491]  And support us financially.
[02:10:39.491 --> 02:10:42.012]  We've got free shipping running for the last month.
[02:10:42.012 --> 02:10:43.512]  It ends today.
[02:10:43.512 --> 02:10:45.873]  We've got 66% off colloidal silver.
[02:10:45.873 --> 02:10:46.513]  Never done that.
[02:10:46.513 --> 02:10:49.894]  30% off ProPure high-quality gravity-fed filters.
[02:10:49.894 --> 02:10:51.554]  Alexa Pure air filtration.
[02:10:53.271 --> 02:10:59.194]  50% off our great Natural Sleep Aid Knockout with the Melatonin L-Tryptophan, Valerian Root, and so much more.
[02:10:59.194 --> 02:11:02.595]  I mean, these are great deals, high quality products.
[02:11:02.595 --> 02:11:04.836]  Super Blue Toothpaste is back in stock.
[02:11:04.836 --> 02:11:08.978]  Super Blue for children that doesn't have the peppermint, so it doesn't taste too strong.
[02:11:08.978 --> 02:11:11.619]  That's back in.
[02:11:11.619 --> 02:11:12.939]  These are amazing products.
[02:11:12.939 --> 02:11:14.680]  I mean, here's an example, and then I'll quit plugging.
[02:11:16.574 --> 02:11:21.516]  Our Prosteguard, we went to one of the biggest, you know, top companies in the nation over organic production.
[02:11:21.516 --> 02:11:27.639]  We said, we want a strong Assault Palmetto documented good for your prostate and other glands.
[02:11:27.639 --> 02:11:32.742]  We want it as strong as these other big leading competitors that sell it for $40.
[02:11:32.742 --> 02:11:42.266]  But we also want to add a bunch of other known herbs and things that are good for the prostate and have it for $20 less.
[02:11:42.266 --> 02:11:43.547]  Well, it's on sale right now.
[02:11:44.718 --> 02:11:45.801]  Or even more.
[02:11:45.801 --> 02:11:46.563]  It's 1995 Prostagard.
[02:11:46.563 --> 02:11:48.168]  You cannot get a better...
[02:11:51.368 --> 02:11:58.415]  Over-the-counter, natural, herbal, and even the government, you know, lets you say with salt palmettos, documented good for your prostate.
[02:11:58.415 --> 02:12:01.738]  It's better than the drugs that are out there, you know, but it's just, it's amazing what God's given us.
[02:12:01.738 --> 02:12:02.438]  There's an example.
[02:12:02.438 --> 02:12:07.683]  The best formula out there from our research, the best ingredients, high quality, no fillers, $19.95.
[02:12:07.683 --> 02:12:08.484]  Leading competitors are $44, $49.
[02:12:08.484 --> 02:12:10.026]  I mean, it's a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:12:10.026 --> 02:12:10.466]  Ours is amazing.
[02:12:15.911 --> 02:12:17.332]  Same thing with knockout.
[02:12:17.332 --> 02:12:23.277]  One bottle of melatonin, the same dose as ours, three milligrams, $19.95 on average.
[02:12:23.277 --> 02:12:31.703]  Ours is $14.95 with a discount, and normally $19.95, with a bunch of other things in it that are also associated with deeper, better sleep, that all work synergistically together.
[02:12:31.703 --> 02:12:37.567]  It's $14.95 right now, 50% off the normal retail.
[02:12:37.567 --> 02:12:39.048]  So, again, great deal.
[02:12:39.048 --> 02:12:40.249]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:12:40.249 --> 02:12:41.290]  Now, going back.
[02:12:43.228 --> 02:12:45.210]  What are they gearing Antifa up?
[02:12:45.210 --> 02:12:50.456]  Why has Soros doubled the amount of money since Trump was elected in January, since he did previously?
[02:12:50.456 --> 02:12:51.658]  What are they gearing up for?
[02:12:51.658 --> 02:12:52.679]  They're calling for violence.
[02:12:52.679 --> 02:12:54.141]  They're calling for Trump's death.
[02:12:54.141 --> 02:12:55.662]  They're calling for it in mainstream news.
[02:12:56.667 --> 02:13:03.788]  They're calling, whether it's Al Gore or whether it's Clapper and Brennan, they're saying something big's about to happen.
[02:13:03.788 --> 02:13:04.689]  It's not impeachment.
[02:13:04.689 --> 02:13:06.009]  We're going to remove him.
[02:13:06.009 --> 02:13:09.430]  We've got to bipartisanly come together for his removal.
[02:13:09.430 --> 02:13:11.750]  Don't do anything when we remove him.
[02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:14.411]  Suddenly Republican leadership is turning against Trump.
[02:13:14.411 --> 02:13:21.192]  As they raise more money than ever raised, as the Democratic Party is being made extinct, they prepare for the killer blow.
[02:13:21.952 --> 02:13:25.975]  And James Leslie Rawls, our expert to break this down, SurvivalBlog.com.
[02:13:25.975 --> 02:13:34.521]  James, this ties into your big lengthy investigative reports, Antifa Part 1 and 2, the Antifa threat spiral.
[02:13:34.521 --> 02:13:35.842]  Break it down for us.
[02:13:35.842 --> 02:13:39.005]  What are the globalists getting ready to do?
[02:13:39.005 --> 02:13:48.892]  Well Alex, I think it's pretty clear that the Antifa movement is being used as kind of a shock troops for
[02:13:49.870 --> 02:14:03.516]  Their goal of destabilizing the government, they want to have a wave of protests, followed by a wave of domestic terrorism in this country.
[02:14:03.516 --> 02:14:13.401]  They want to destabilize, they want to try to create a counteraction by the Trump administration.
[02:14:13.401 --> 02:14:15.662]  They're hoping for a Kent State type event.
[02:14:16.380 --> 02:14:30.049]  Where it would demoralize the American populace, turn the populace against the Trump administration, and be part of their overall campaign to get Trump out of office.
[02:14:30.049 --> 02:14:35.432]  And I think that if you look at Antifa, how they were set up,
[02:14:36.394 --> 02:14:41.578]  How they interact between their cells.
[02:14:41.578 --> 02:14:51.026]  It's very similar to what we saw in the late 1960s and early 1970s with the radicalization of the anti-war movement.
[02:14:51.026 --> 02:14:57.531]  And that spun off a number of incredibly radical terrorist groups.
[02:14:57.531 --> 02:14:58.932]  A lot of them were cellular.
[02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:14.613]  Some there was some interaction between cells and in fact there was some interaction internationally with groups like the PLO and the Red Army Faction in Germany, the Italian Red Brigades and so forth.
[02:15:14.613 --> 02:15:19.997]  I think we're going to see a very similar era here in the United States in the very near future.
[02:15:19.997 --> 02:15:22.900]  Well we know Black Lives Matter is fashioned after a black
[02:15:24.096 --> 02:15:28.300]  Lady who's an admitted Marxist who killed a police officer, who's a hero in Cuba today.
[02:15:28.300 --> 02:15:29.261]  She's a U.S.
[02:15:29.261 --> 02:15:31.503]  citizen living in Cuba.
[02:15:31.503 --> 02:15:38.930]  And we know that they're fashioning themselves after Saul Alinsky, who pledged allegiance to Lucifer in his opening book, Rules for Radicals.
[02:15:38.930 --> 02:15:43.314]  We know that they have fashioned themselves after the weathermen, and they've been openly preparing.
[02:15:43.314 --> 02:15:45.436]  So when you hand out the books, you teach it.
[02:15:46.536 --> 02:15:50.121]  Then you say in the media, Trump needs to die, his supporters need to die.
[02:15:50.121 --> 02:15:57.652]  You're giving direct orders, just like Al-Qaeda puts out videos and says, you know, go out, do this, here's the way you do it.
[02:15:57.652 --> 02:15:58.813]  Al-Qaeda's just as guilty.
[02:15:59.821 --> 02:16:00.661]  Well, if you look at the
[02:16:26.676 --> 02:16:42.071]  The event where James Hodgkinson shot up the baseball practice, the congressional baseball practice, and where Congressman Scalise was very gravely injured, and he'll have a very long recovery from that.
[02:16:42.071 --> 02:16:45.474]  I think that was just a precursor of what we're going to see.
[02:16:45.474 --> 02:16:50.579]  In the tech world, he would be called what's called an early adopter.
[02:16:51.708 --> 02:16:53.169]  Or false flags!
[02:16:53.169 --> 02:16:53.809]  Or false flags!
[02:17:13.562 --> 02:17:16.405]  Most of what we're going to see is going to be cellular.
[02:17:16.405 --> 02:17:26.333]  So it'll be leaderless resistance, small cells, motivated politically by the George Soros's of the world.
[02:17:26.333 --> 02:17:33.099]  But because they're independent cells, they'll be very hard to penetrate by law enforcement and intelligence organizations.
[02:17:33.099 --> 02:17:37.223]  And they're going to use off-the-shelf technologies
[02:17:38.189 --> 02:17:42.472]  to inflict massive terror on the United States.
[02:17:42.472 --> 02:17:56.081]  And with the technologies that exist, it will be fairly easy, fairly inexpensive, and again, very difficult to stop because it'll be a cellular organization.
[02:17:56.081 --> 02:18:03.406]  And some of those technologies include things like off-the-shelf quadrocopter drones.
[02:18:03.406 --> 02:18:05.528]  You can go into any hobby store and buy one.
[02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:20.215]  And granted they're fairly small, but if you use a very compact explosive, or if you use a toxin, or as I described in my article, a toxin mixed with a transdermal carrier like DMSO,
[02:18:21.384 --> 02:18:32.793]  All it takes is a very small explosive charge, vaporizing a toxin that's been mixed with DMSO, and you have dozens of people dead in a 20-30 foot radius.
[02:18:32.793 --> 02:18:33.914]  Well, here's my next point.
[02:18:33.914 --> 02:18:44.982]  What does Trump, what does the American people do, as they openly gear up to remove him, openly gear up from terrorism, openly start attacking people and doing stuff, what do we do?
[02:18:44.982 --> 02:18:46.623]  Well, the best thing that we can do is
[02:18:48.354 --> 02:18:50.896]  Still be quite active politically.
[02:18:50.896 --> 02:18:58.660]  We need to watch out for our own families, and the best thing there is to stay away from public gatherings, large public gatherings.
[02:18:58.660 --> 02:19:16.250]  And one of the things I predicted in this two-part article was that I think that the terrorist adoption of some of these technologies is going to make traditional open-air speeches by politicians a thing of the past.
[02:19:16.866 --> 02:19:20.768]  They're not going to, or even in a stadium, for example.
[02:19:20.768 --> 02:19:22.288]  They're not going to be able to do that.
[02:19:22.288 --> 02:19:24.669]  It just won't be safe to do.
[02:19:24.669 --> 02:19:33.173]  Because in this next wave of terrorism, just like the bomb scares and bombings of the late 60s, early 70s, we're going to see
[02:19:34.102 --> 02:19:41.249]  Quadricopter attacks on so many public gatherings that people simply won't feel safe to be there.
[02:19:41.249 --> 02:19:46.073]  This is the perfect thing for somebody who doesn't want to be a suicide bomber to just use a robot to do it.
[02:19:46.073 --> 02:19:47.595]  We're in the 21st century.
[02:19:47.595 --> 02:19:58.625]  Robots are so expensive they can easily carry, for a $500 drone, a four-pound package of explosives with nails on the bottom to kill a few people and create panic, or as you said, release a chemical weapon.
[02:19:59.105 --> 02:20:00.566]  And they've all been gearing up for it.
[02:20:00.566 --> 02:20:05.709]  We'll be right back on the other side, breaking down the Antifa threat spiral.
[02:20:05.709 --> 02:20:08.291]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[02:20:08.291 --> 02:20:10.432]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[02:20:10.432 --> 02:20:12.414]  Are you happy paying high prices?
[02:20:12.414 --> 02:20:14.475]  Find your happiness with Pure Soap.

[02:24:00.653 --> 02:24:02.334]  Deadline for $0.10 guarantee is August 31st.
[02:24:25.822 --> 02:24:41.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, all over the world, the Global Crime Syndicate, led by people like George Soros, have started the Arab Spring, killed over a million people, funded the Ukrainian overthrow of an elected government, and countless other currency manipulations and other civil wars.
[02:24:41.840 --> 02:24:43.401]  So you ask, why are they so confident?
[02:24:43.401 --> 02:24:44.683]  Because they've done it before.
[02:24:46.323 --> 02:24:48.785]  But it isn't just Donald Trump operating alone.
[02:24:48.785 --> 02:24:54.190]  Patriots in our government, in the deep state, are battling the other elements of the deep state.
[02:24:54.190 --> 02:24:57.513]  There is a civil war in the deep state.
[02:24:57.513 --> 02:25:01.196]  But the establishment deep state has the MSM.
[02:25:01.196 --> 02:25:04.760]  But that's a weapon that really backfires on them.
[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:10.345]  So now they're running even bigger hoaxes and attempting to try to get the public back under their control.
[02:25:10.345 --> 02:25:11.286]  I don't see it happening.
[02:25:12.031 --> 02:25:17.423]  So instead they're getting more and more and more hysterical as everything they do fails.
[02:25:17.423 --> 02:25:22.273]  And so there is a amplification, a spiral, a threat continuum.
[02:25:23.829 --> 02:25:25.691]  Acceleration.
[02:25:25.691 --> 02:25:28.353]  A threat continuum expansion.
[02:25:28.353 --> 02:25:30.695]  Where the elites believe they're in power.
[02:25:30.695 --> 02:25:33.698]  They have a normalcy bias of being in power.
[02:25:33.698 --> 02:25:36.981]  They have a confirmation bias being around each other.
[02:25:36.981 --> 02:25:39.663]  But none of them have really ever gotten their feet wet.
[02:25:39.663 --> 02:25:42.106]  They're telling the killers to go out and start killing people.
[02:25:42.106 --> 02:25:44.628]  They're not even following the orders at this point.
[02:25:44.628 --> 02:25:47.090]  And so there's a major breakdown in the system.
[02:25:47.090 --> 02:25:48.992]  Is that a good way to put it, James Leslie Ross?
[02:25:53.049 --> 02:25:56.510]  We still have our guest?
[02:25:56.510 --> 02:25:58.831]  James, can you hear me?
[02:25:58.831 --> 02:26:02.453]  We'll get James Wesley Rawls' take on that as soon as we get his phone back on.
[02:26:02.453 --> 02:26:07.135]  He was having Skype problems and phone problems today at his home.
[02:26:07.135 --> 02:26:16.038]  Now, we sit here at the precipice and we release such bombshells on a daily basis, I don't think people understand why the enemy hates us.
[02:26:16.038 --> 02:26:20.040]  They know if you ever really start paying attention, it's over.
[02:26:20.040 --> 02:26:21.901]  We broke that Obama stole
[02:26:25.778 --> 02:26:28.901]  90, 290 plus billion dollars from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
[02:26:28.901 --> 02:26:37.349]  We are putting out and pushing that Si Hirsch is out there being interviewed and no one else is picking this up saying we know who the DNC leaguer was.
[02:26:37.349 --> 02:26:39.190]  It was Seth Rich and then he gives the evidence.
[02:26:39.190 --> 02:26:43.755]  This is bombshell information.
[02:26:43.755 --> 02:26:46.798]  James Leslie Rawls looking at their escalation.
[02:26:46.798 --> 02:26:47.979]  Look at how they're failing.
[02:26:49.178 --> 02:26:52.402]  Well, I think in the near future, we're going to see the wave of terrorism that I described.
[02:27:04.094 --> 02:27:17.849]  And it may be analogous to what we saw in Northern Ireland in the 1960s and 70s, where you have the so-called official side of the IRA.
[02:27:17.849 --> 02:27:22.775]  The political side of it was encapsulated in an organization called Sinn Féin.
[02:27:23.752 --> 02:27:27.253]  And Sinn Féin was the political side.
[02:27:27.253 --> 02:27:38.796]  They actually claimed to disavow any contact or any control or any cooperation with terrorists.
[02:27:38.796 --> 02:27:41.477]  But they were all part of the same organization.
[02:27:41.477 --> 02:27:50.199]  I think we could see the same thing develop here in the States with the mainstream Antifa movement being political.
[02:27:50.199 --> 02:27:52.780]  And then you have dozens of splinter groups
[02:27:53.547 --> 02:28:00.189]  Which are officially disavowed by the main portion of Antifa.
[02:28:00.189 --> 02:28:03.330]  But they'll be, you know, conjoined at the hip.
[02:28:03.330 --> 02:28:04.590]  They'll be all the same people.
[02:28:04.590 --> 02:28:09.851]  Well, they're already burning things and beating people and attacking people and hospitalizing and calling for everybody's death.
[02:28:09.851 --> 02:28:11.492]  And clearly it's escalating.
[02:28:11.492 --> 02:28:15.593]  What is the flashpoint where it's openly being called terrorism and how bad do you think it'll get?
[02:28:15.593 --> 02:28:16.333]  What's the timetable?
[02:28:17.085 --> 02:28:36.623]  Well, I think that with the off-the-shelf technologies that exist, and especially with, unfortunately, the NSA releasing into the wild their hacking tool set, any of those hacking tools could be used for an attack on public utilities, for example.
[02:28:36.623 --> 02:28:39.626]  And we could see an attack on the SCADA systems.
[02:28:40.609 --> 02:28:41.710]  James, let me ask you this.
[02:28:57.618 --> 02:29:14.237]  Well, a lot of other top analysts agree with you, and in closing, we see in the data dumps of WikiLeaks as of late, and others, Vault 7 of the CIA, how they're framing Russia and others, but Russia particularly, with cyber attacks run by leftist Deep State,
[02:29:16.308 --> 02:29:21.130]  Like Reality Winner and others that are Wahhabis back against the United States to blame Russia.
[02:29:21.130 --> 02:29:30.593]  I'm really concerned about cyber false flags carried out by minions of Clapper and others, Brennan and others, to then be blamed on Russia as a provocation.
[02:29:32.018 --> 02:29:32.739]  Well, yes.
[02:29:32.739 --> 02:29:39.022]  The false flag could point to Russia, or the false flag could point at American patriots.
[02:29:39.022 --> 02:29:41.003]  It's just a matter of who they want to set up.
[02:29:41.003 --> 02:29:46.766]  There'll be convenient patsies that they'll be able to set up very easily.
[02:29:46.766 --> 02:29:50.949]  Because, let's face it, it's a purely cyber environment.
[02:29:50.949 --> 02:29:56.012]  They can create a trail to whatever server they want to create.
[02:29:56.012 --> 02:29:57.392]  It's perfect frame of territory.
[02:29:57.392 --> 02:29:57.913]  Thank you, James.
[02:29:59.056 --> 02:30:02.061]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.061 --> 02:30:03.944]  Joe Arpaio's Lawyers, up next.
[02:30:06.656 --> 02:30:13.638]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights, wrote, Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected.
[02:30:13.638 --> 02:30:19.140]  No man is safe in his opinions, in his person, in his faculties, or in his possessions.
[02:30:19.140 --> 02:30:22.482]  Is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington?
[02:30:22.482 --> 02:30:24.842]  The only question is, how do we contain it?
[02:30:24.842 --> 02:30:30.164]  And how do we remove that power from Washington to our local communities to the individual?
[02:30:30.164 --> 02:30:31.745]  That is the ultimate concern.
[02:30:32.005 --> 02:30:38.168]  The concentration of power, the excess of power, was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[02:30:38.168 --> 02:30:40.669]  It was why the Anti-Federalists opposed the Constitution.
[02:30:40.669 --> 02:30:49.274]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power, but as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[02:30:49.714 --> 02:30:55.096]  People who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[02:30:55.096 --> 02:31:00.458]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing, of what the real constraints upon them are.
[02:31:00.458 --> 02:31:04.159]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[02:31:04.159 --> 02:31:06.020]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:31:06.360 --> 02:31:15.447]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:31:15.447 --> 02:31:23.854]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:31:23.854 --> 02:31:28.737]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:31:28.737 --> 02:31:32.120]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[02:31:33.601 --> 02:31:34.381]  We're good to go.
[02:31:57.575 --> 02:32:03.881]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:32:03.881 --> 02:32:05.542]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[02:32:07.751 --> 02:32:11.534]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:32:11.534 --> 02:32:19.259]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:32:19.259 --> 02:32:27.884]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:32:27.884 --> 02:32:32.307]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:32:32.307 --> 02:32:37.671]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[02:32:37.891 --> 02:32:42.115]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:32:42.115 --> 02:32:45.538]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[02:32:45.538 --> 02:32:56.687]  AnthroPlex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[02:32:56.687 --> 02:32:59.590]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[02:32:59.590 --> 02:33:05.575]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[02:33:16.657 --> 02:33:17.777]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:17.777 --> 02:33:22.999]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:22.999 --> 02:33:30.061]  Stella was completely wasting, out of work and down.
[02:33:30.061 --> 02:33:34.923]  All inside it's so frustrating as a driven town.
[02:33:54.236 --> 02:33:58.139]  If you did,
[02:34:20.194 --> 02:34:22.877]  Doing the same thing, too.
[02:34:22.877 --> 02:34:25.559]  Well, we had another political prisoner on earlier.
[02:34:25.559 --> 02:34:31.004]  Dinesh D'Souza headed up an entire cabinet position for Ronald Reagan.
[02:34:31.004 --> 02:34:31.865]  No criminal record.
[02:34:31.865 --> 02:34:33.066]  He got five of his friends.
[02:34:33.066 --> 02:34:36.750]  I think a political contribution to one of his other friends.
[02:34:36.750 --> 02:34:40.193]  And they said, well, you didn't sign some paperwork.
[02:34:40.193 --> 02:34:43.116]  You're going to spend nine months in prison, federal prison.
[02:34:44.028 --> 02:34:47.809]  Well, now he's put out the big lie exposing the Nazi roots of the American left.
[02:34:47.809 --> 02:34:48.850]  He was on earlier.
[02:34:48.850 --> 02:34:51.911]  Guess who else they want to make a political prisoner?
[02:34:51.911 --> 02:35:03.994]  Former federal agent, long-running sheriff, no criminal record, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, found guilty of contempt to a judge who's been in the hip pocket of the Democrats.
[02:35:03.994 --> 02:35:05.175]  This is incredible.
[02:35:06.749 --> 02:35:12.433]  This is Arpaio vindicated, arresting illegals that committed felony crimes, you name it.
[02:35:12.433 --> 02:35:15.056]  Arrested illegals that chopped people's heads off.
[02:35:15.056 --> 02:35:18.939]  I mean, he tried to stop the crime that's in Mexico from coming here.
[02:35:18.939 --> 02:35:26.725]  And now George Soros, Bloomberg, you name it, spent tens of millions to get him removed there out of Maricopa County.
[02:35:27.964 --> 02:35:30.948]  Kind of a bellwether of everything that we've now seen.
[02:35:30.948 --> 02:35:37.098]  And so now they're trying to put him in jail and make him a political prisoner as well.
[02:35:37.098 --> 02:35:42.766]  Mark Goldman is one of the founders of Goldman and Zwillinger, a law firm that focuses on commercial litigation.
[02:35:43.667 --> 02:35:47.631]  He served as an adjunct professor of law, teaching constitutional law and legal writing.
[02:35:47.631 --> 02:35:53.737]  Also, he served as special assistant county attorney for Maricopa County, Arizona, licensed attorney since 1988.
[02:35:53.737 --> 02:35:59.262]  Mark represents high-profile clients with expertise in public relations.
[02:36:00.498 --> 02:36:18.843]  GZLawOffice.com is their site, and he is Arpaio's lawyer, here to break down what's been called a kangaroo court, a kangaroo ruling, and again they're in the news saying, I need to be arrested as a Russian spy with no evidence, and the president as well, so they want to put us all in jail.
[02:36:18.843 --> 02:36:22.103]  What's really going on here, Mark?
[02:36:22.103 --> 02:36:28.665]  This is a political lynching of a dedicated
[02:36:29.534 --> 02:36:39.398]  Law enforcement officer who has served his country and the people of Arizona for many years with an impeccable record.
[02:36:39.398 --> 02:36:41.279]  And it's just a travesty.
[02:36:43.783 --> 02:36:46.865]  Let's break down the facts because folks want us to go out.
[02:36:46.865 --> 02:36:53.768]  They want Trump to go out as family and to go out and fight for our sovereignty and to not let unvetted radical Muslims in.
[02:36:53.768 --> 02:36:55.929]  And then once we do it, they're trying to kill Trump.
[02:36:55.929 --> 02:36:57.110]  They're trying to remove him from office.
[02:36:57.110 --> 02:36:59.491]  They're trying to put people in prison.
[02:36:59.491 --> 02:37:00.631]  I mean, they come after folks.
[02:37:00.631 --> 02:37:08.135]  So now is the time to understand what happened to Joe Arpaio and how we can, you know, hopefully support him.
[02:37:08.135 --> 02:37:09.216]  So lay out
[02:37:10.653 --> 02:37:11.514]  We've got some time here.
[02:37:11.514 --> 02:37:13.194]  Exactly what happened to him?
[02:37:13.194 --> 02:37:15.175]  Because I mean, I was following it in the news.
[02:37:15.175 --> 02:37:17.476]  Unprecedented actions.
[02:37:17.476 --> 02:37:17.876]  Right.
[02:37:17.876 --> 02:37:26.000]  This was the timeline leading up to this doesn't lie.
[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.961]  And it speaks for itself.
[02:37:28.961 --> 02:37:33.423]  11 days before the Arizona primary last August,
[02:37:35.430 --> 02:37:53.464]  For which, which included the sheriff's primary race, which was contested in the Arizona primary for sheriff, where Sheriff Arpaio was running for his seventh four-year term in office.
[02:37:53.464 --> 02:38:02.331]  A federal judge who had been handling one of the cases in which the sheriff was involved, coincidentally referred the matter
[02:38:03.450 --> 02:38:08.354]  For criminal contempt prosecution.
[02:38:08.354 --> 02:38:14.358]  To the US Attorney's Office and to the court to the federal court.
[02:38:14.358 --> 02:38:19.582]  This was again 11 days prior.
[02:38:19.582 --> 02:38:23.726]  To the primary election, just coincidental, of course, then.
[02:38:23.726 --> 02:38:26.988]  Yeah, then.
[02:38:26.988 --> 02:38:30.291]  The sheriff won the primary election and then.
[02:38:32.088 --> 02:38:41.526]  Two weeks to the day prior to the general election in which the sheriff was now running in the in the primary.
[02:38:44.163 --> 02:38:44.744]  That's okay.
[02:38:44.744 --> 02:38:45.224]  It's Skype.
[02:38:45.224 --> 02:38:45.624]  It's live.
[02:38:45.624 --> 02:38:48.265]  People love to sometimes dogs or folks knocking on the door.
[02:38:48.265 --> 02:38:48.986]  It absolutely happens.
[02:38:48.986 --> 02:38:51.647]  And just while you're getting that, just expand on this.
[02:38:51.647 --> 02:38:55.489]  We've seen the Ninth Circuit say you can't have American flags in school.
[02:38:55.489 --> 02:39:00.671]  The same Ninth Circuit said that he couldn't, you know, control people from places like Somalia.
[02:39:00.671 --> 02:39:01.772]  And you have other courts ruling.
[02:39:01.772 --> 02:39:03.373]  The Supreme Court struck that down.
[02:39:03.373 --> 02:39:08.035]  But we've seen incredible judicial tyranny by the Democrats the last few years.
[02:39:08.035 --> 02:39:11.037]  I mean, it is frightening the types of things they do.
[02:39:11.037 --> 02:39:11.597]  Please continue.
[02:39:12.915 --> 02:39:14.762]  Yeah, so this matter.
[02:39:16.215 --> 02:39:32.466]  Coincidentally, of course, two weeks to the day prior to the general election, the court issues a show cause order, ordering Sheriff Arpaio to show cause why he should not be held in criminal contempt of court.
[02:39:32.466 --> 02:39:37.029]  Again, coincidentally, two days to the day before the general election.
[02:39:37.029 --> 02:39:42.953]  And this matter was pursued by the Department of Justice under the Obama administration.
[02:39:42.953 --> 02:39:44.814]  The same folks that meet on tarmacs with Bill Clinton.
[02:39:45.899 --> 02:39:57.403]  Exactly, the exact same people under the exact same Attorney General who met with Bill Clinton, coincidentally, at the Phoenix Airport.
[02:39:57.403 --> 02:40:05.045]  This is the same Justice Department that Congressman Steve King and others are saying need to be criminally investigated for all the things they've done.
[02:40:05.045 --> 02:40:12.928]  Yes, and again, this was the same Justice Department that clearly initiated this.
[02:40:14.255 --> 02:40:24.815]  concurrent with an election which was which to which there had been a huge public outcry when Comey
[02:40:28.012 --> 02:40:37.880]  took action, and the FBI is under the Department of Justice, when he took action regarding Hillary Clinton shortly before the presidential election.
[02:40:37.880 --> 02:40:40.201]  And people were saying, oh, that's terrible.
[02:40:40.201 --> 02:40:46.846]  The Justice Department has a policy that they will not take this sort of action prior to an election.
[02:40:46.846 --> 02:40:54.032]  Well, gee whiz, they took this action right before, coincidentally, right before Sheriff Arpaio's general election.
[02:40:56.144 --> 02:40:57.485]  Wow.
[02:40:57.485 --> 02:41:03.289]  Let's continue now up to the trial and the so-called conviction, all the rest of it.
[02:41:03.289 --> 02:41:17.838]  Yeah, well, my law firm stepped into this case late in the game and we filed several motions, pre-trial motions.
[02:41:17.838 --> 02:41:22.601]  Every single one of them was denied.
[02:41:22.601 --> 02:41:23.582]  Let's see, we also
[02:41:24.693 --> 02:41:36.023]  We even filed a motion just to stop the trial for a brief period of time because it was going to overlap with my only son's bar mitzvah.
[02:41:36.023 --> 02:41:37.404]  And no dice.
[02:41:37.404 --> 02:41:43.269]  We couldn't even get that courtesy from the government or the court.
[02:41:43.269 --> 02:41:48.534]  The government had the audacity to argue that it's just a one-day social event, so who cares?
[02:41:50.576 --> 02:41:54.059]  In any event, as I said, we got into the game late.
[02:41:54.059 --> 02:42:13.956]  This was pursued by the very same, contrary to fake news and false media reports, this was pursued by the Justice Department, although under Sessions, by the very same attorneys that were pursuing it during the Obama administration.
[02:42:13.956 --> 02:42:16.358]  I sent a letter directly to Sessions.
[02:42:17.559 --> 02:42:33.712]  And before the trial, explaining to him that this case was being brought forward and prosecuted under the wrong statute, which it was and has been and continues to be.
[02:42:33.712 --> 02:42:40.218]  The Justice Department used a statute and the court sanctioned it that
[02:42:41.335 --> 02:43:03.448]  is inapplicable to the facts of this case and had they used the correct statute there wouldn't have been a trial because that statute provides for a one-year statute of limitations which had expired and even if the one-year statute of limitations had arguably not expired that statute provides in
[02:43:07.848 --> 02:43:16.055]  Uh, unambiguous terms and exact terms that the sheriff was entitled to a jury trial.
[02:43:16.055 --> 02:43:22.241]  And needless to say, as we all know now, the sheriff was denied a jury trial in this matter.
[02:43:22.241 --> 02:43:26.024]  That's why I said, tell us about the trial because he wasn't allowed to have one.
[02:43:26.024 --> 02:43:28.526]  He was given a kangaroo hearing.
[02:43:28.526 --> 02:43:28.966]  Well, sure.
[02:43:28.966 --> 02:43:29.347]  I mean this.
[02:43:30.405 --> 02:43:39.769]  This was a criminal referral by one judge in a federal court to another judge in the same federal court.
[02:43:39.769 --> 02:43:46.752]  It's similar to asking, like, a victim to try a case to be the... By the way, I'm not a lawyer like you.
[02:43:46.752 --> 02:43:55.176]  Isn't it in the Constitution that if your life's in jeopardy or you're facing jail time, that by law you can demand a jury trial?
[02:43:55.176 --> 02:43:57.417]  It is, however, it has been narrowed.
[02:43:57.417 --> 02:43:59.658]  That has been narrowed by the Supreme Court.
[02:44:00.603 --> 02:44:10.420]  Uh, certainly by the it has been narrowed and it is not today unless the Supreme Court overrules itself.
[02:44:11.184 --> 02:44:13.605]  Which they should do in that matter.
[02:44:13.605 --> 02:44:15.987]  So where are we going here and what can we do for Sheriff Arpaio?
[02:44:15.987 --> 02:44:17.288]  Because he's a champion.
[02:44:17.288 --> 02:44:18.248]  He could have rolled over.
[02:44:18.248 --> 02:44:19.989]  He had the UN come after him.
[02:44:19.989 --> 02:44:21.610]  He got all these lawsuits.
[02:44:21.610 --> 02:44:22.831]  They tried to destroy him.
[02:44:22.831 --> 02:44:24.512]  All because he followed the law.
[02:44:24.512 --> 02:44:30.055]  800 plus cities are sanctuary cities where they let criminals, you know, be deported 20 times, rapist, murderers.
[02:44:30.055 --> 02:44:34.117]  The media always exaggerates and acts like he was grabbing kids off the street, which he wasn't.
[02:44:34.117 --> 02:44:34.878]  He followed the law.
[02:44:35.953 --> 02:44:37.455]  Now they're trying to throw him in jail.
[02:44:37.455 --> 02:44:42.701]  I mean, clearly, Trump is mad at Sessions because Sessions is intimidated.
[02:44:42.701 --> 02:44:44.283]  I don't know what's going on.
[02:44:44.283 --> 02:44:45.644]  All these crimes are being committed.
[02:44:45.644 --> 02:44:48.247]  They're trying to bring down Trump.
[02:44:48.247 --> 02:44:56.057]  People say, well, Trump could pardon Arpaio, but I guess Arpaio simply is appealing right now, wanting a jury trial.
[02:44:57.179 --> 02:44:58.099]  Exactly.
[02:44:58.099 --> 02:45:02.721]  We have a pending petition before the U.S.
[02:45:02.721 --> 02:45:16.945]  Supreme Court, and contrary again to the fake news, which has reported that the petition was denied by the Supreme Court, it was never denied by the Supreme Court, and it is still pending before the Supreme Court to this day.
[02:45:16.945 --> 02:45:23.087]  The only thing that the Supreme Court denied was our request for an expedited
[02:45:24.205 --> 02:45:27.867]  A ruling or a stay of the trial.
[02:45:27.867 --> 02:45:45.297]  The Supreme Court denied that back in June, but it never denied the petition and it's sitting there right before the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court can take action now, tomorrow, next week, next month, reversing this whole matter solely based on the clear
[02:45:47.040 --> 02:45:52.228]  Violation of the law, where this was brought under the wrong statute.
[02:45:52.228 --> 02:45:54.511]  And I wouldn't sit here and say... Well, I mean, he doesn't get the appeal.
[02:45:54.511 --> 02:45:56.194]  What is he facing?
[02:45:56.194 --> 02:45:57.436]  Well, wait a second.
[02:45:57.436 --> 02:45:58.517]  And that's the Supreme Court.
[02:45:58.517 --> 02:46:02.123]  But we also have... We'll be appealing this to the Ninth Circuit.
[02:46:04.004 --> 02:46:11.410]  Sure, but that's why I raised the Ninth Circuit, is because I know that you guys are under that.
[02:46:11.410 --> 02:46:14.573]  That is, you know, the most reverse court out there, 80 plus percent of the time.
[02:46:14.573 --> 02:46:20.818]  I mean, I know you don't want prejudice for him saying bad things about him, but, I mean, you talk about cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.
[02:46:32.771 --> 02:46:34.953]  Sure, but if they don't, what is Arpaio facing?
[02:46:48.027 --> 02:47:10.480]  He faces up to six months in prison and at one time discussing this matter with the head of the public integrity section of the Department of Justice that's prosecuting this matter and get this this this is the public integrity section of the Department of Justice which is using the wrong statute to prosecute Sheriff Arpaio and they said they want
[02:47:12.075 --> 02:47:22.940]  It'll just make him more of a hero.
[02:47:22.940 --> 02:47:24.741]  I mean, he is so demonized.
[02:47:24.741 --> 02:47:27.062]  And again, I get demonized.
[02:47:27.062 --> 02:47:30.363]  There's not many of us in this club that get lied about and demonized and misrepresented.
[02:47:31.874 --> 02:47:36.057]  They've had court rulings, and then the media says, I lost my kids.
[02:47:36.057 --> 02:47:39.399]  My children are with me the majority of the time.
[02:47:39.399 --> 02:47:44.383]  But the media lies so bad, they say, I'm deeply racist, and then don't show where I'm racist.
[02:47:44.383 --> 02:47:56.031]  I mean, they just, and so it just makes me, endears me more to like Trump or an Arpaio, because I'm in the club where you, I mean, the media has reached new lows of lying, but you know, the good news is,
[02:47:57.759 --> 02:48:01.422]  Only weak-minded people believe it, and Democrat-run federal courts.
[02:48:01.422 --> 02:48:03.283]  It's scary to understand.
[02:48:03.283 --> 02:48:11.150]  I'm also in the club where they want to put us in jail now, and you know, you as a counselor, as an officer of the court, I know you've studied history.
[02:48:11.150 --> 02:48:15.253]  What is it like to see our political climate this dangerous?
[02:48:15.253 --> 02:48:21.278]  It is really scary, and it was scary to read this opinion, and it's scary to see what has gone on.
[02:48:22.296 --> 02:48:23.597]  With Sheriff Arpaio?
[02:48:23.597 --> 02:48:40.470]  Because every citizen should be concerned about, whether a Democrat or a Republican, because what if this were a Republican, what if that was a Republican Department of Justice that initiated this and it was before Trump appointed judges?
[02:48:40.470 --> 02:48:45.273]  I wouldn't support throwing somebody in jail because of something like this.
[02:48:45.273 --> 02:48:45.934]  This is crazy.
[02:48:46.761 --> 02:48:47.201]  Right.
[02:48:47.201 --> 02:49:00.271]  It's an interference by the courts with the executive branch and the autonomy of the executive branch and the will of the people when they vote in people because this was done to defeat a candidate.
[02:49:00.271 --> 02:49:08.238]  That there is no... So for political purposes, plus how is it... how is a... we should probably spend a minute or two on what happened in the contempt.
[02:49:08.238 --> 02:49:09.559]  Why don't you tell folks about that?
[02:49:10.579 --> 02:49:11.219]  Well, I will.
[02:49:11.219 --> 02:49:14.021]  Let me just opine on one thing before I forget this.
[02:49:14.021 --> 02:49:16.702]  And just, Alex, think about this.
[02:49:16.702 --> 02:49:26.305]  Think about that a few months ago, the FBI said that they don't have time to monitor all potential terrorists in the United States.
[02:49:26.305 --> 02:49:28.346]  They don't have enough manpower.
[02:49:28.346 --> 02:49:34.329]  But they have enough manpower to pursue an 85-year-old retired sheriff.
[02:49:34.329 --> 02:49:34.909]  On a windshield?
[02:49:36.320 --> 02:49:38.361]  And that's just really tragic.
[02:49:38.361 --> 02:49:51.427]  And again, regardless of your political affiliation, do we really want scarce prosecutorial and law enforcement resources wasting their time on something this... But look what they did to Tom DeLay.
[02:49:51.427 --> 02:49:53.428]  He didn't do anything wrong.
[02:49:53.428 --> 02:49:56.150]  He was later found not guilty.
[02:49:56.150 --> 02:50:01.132]  They constantly are on witch hunts trying to put people in prison.
[02:50:01.132 --> 02:50:03.053]  Right, because it's a lot safer
[02:50:04.113 --> 02:50:16.257]  For the FBI to go out and interview a bunch of people in connection with what Sheriff Arpaio might have said to them and actually chase dangerous terrorists.
[02:50:16.257 --> 02:50:20.499]  And that's frankly what I think everybody in the country would like to see our FBI doing.
[02:50:20.499 --> 02:50:21.579]  Alright, stay right there.
[02:50:21.579 --> 02:50:23.300]  What about the separation of powers you raised?
[02:50:23.840 --> 02:50:26.883]  Because it's true the president doesn't have to answer questions of Congress.
[02:50:26.883 --> 02:50:31.147]  It's true a sheriff, if it's not a particular criminal case, he himself is being charged with.
[02:50:31.147 --> 02:50:32.988]  And the sheriff would say that's proprietary information.
[02:50:32.988 --> 02:50:35.230]  I'm not going to give that out to this court.
[02:50:35.230 --> 02:50:37.332]  People don't understand the separation of powers in government.
[02:50:37.332 --> 02:50:43.618]  Now the judiciary has been trying to run over all of that selectively and it's a very dangerous situation.
[02:50:43.618 --> 02:50:44.159]  Don't forget!
[02:50:45.146 --> 02:50:46.387]  It ends today.

[02:51:11.337 --> 02:51:14.038]  I am from the government and I'm here to help.
[02:51:14.038 --> 02:51:17.259]  Adequacy of loss absorbing capacity.
[02:51:17.259 --> 02:51:18.539]  You call that help?
[02:51:18.539 --> 02:51:20.740]  That's the mandate approved by the G20.
[02:51:20.740 --> 02:51:22.681]  The banks can steal your money!
[02:51:22.841 --> 02:51:26.382]  Well, they can't steal your gold and silver that you fully control.
[02:51:26.382 --> 02:51:34.004]  You can have it delivered into an IRA at a depository under lock and key, where you can hide it, where no one can find it, not even your wife.
[02:51:34.004 --> 02:51:34.724]  What?
[02:51:34.724 --> 02:51:35.745]  Sorry, honey.
[02:51:35.745 --> 02:51:40.346]  Your CDs, money market accounts, and savings accounts are all at risk.

[02:52:05.276 --> 02:52:09.740]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[02:52:09.740 --> 02:52:11.342]  Those times may be near.
[02:52:11.342 --> 02:52:12.243]  Think about it.
[02:52:12.243 --> 02:52:16.867]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[02:52:16.867 --> 02:52:21.492]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[02:52:21.852 --> 02:52:27.657]  And a crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[02:52:27.657 --> 02:52:34.362]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[02:52:34.362 --> 02:52:36.904]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[02:52:37.364 --> 02:52:40.166]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.
[02:52:40.166 --> 02:52:42.667]  Get a 4-week survival food supply for only $99.

[02:53:05.120 --> 02:53:07.082]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:53:07.082 --> 02:53:12.387]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:53:12.387 --> 02:53:13.989]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:53:13.989 --> 02:53:22.337]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[02:53:30.025 --> 02:53:32.288]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:53:32.288 --> 02:53:36.694]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:53:36.694 --> 02:53:38.876]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[02:54:17.068 --> 02:54:25.294]  And that's why we got Roger Stone coming up to host the fourth hour to cover all the latest news, breaking information from inside the White House, what really happened with Scaramucci.
[02:54:25.294 --> 02:54:27.436]  But what is moving forward?
[02:54:27.436 --> 02:54:36.523]  That is all coming up with Roger Stone, who's being sued by Barack Obama's lawyers, claiming with no evidence that he's behind the Russian hacking.
[02:54:36.523 --> 02:54:38.104]  And we now have Cy Hirsch!
[02:54:40.165 --> 02:54:47.850]  Two-time Pulitzer Prize winner saying, from his national intelligence sources, the FBI was surveilling Seth Rich.
[02:54:47.850 --> 02:54:50.773]  And that it was Seth Rich leaked it.
[02:54:50.773 --> 02:54:52.294]  And that's what WikiLeaks has said, too.
[02:54:52.294 --> 02:54:54.475]  This is so big!
[02:54:54.475 --> 02:55:00.599]  Ladies and gentlemen, so I know Roger has a guest coming up in the second segment, but man, sometimes you want to punt on stuff.
[02:55:00.599 --> 02:55:02.561]  I'm sure it's a big guest, because this is big.
[02:55:02.561 --> 02:55:05.223]  I want to find out what Roger has to say about that.
[02:55:06.237 --> 02:55:10.760]  But this is quite a time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen, quite a time.
[02:55:10.760 --> 02:55:12.141]  They are coming after everybody.
[02:55:12.141 --> 02:55:20.828]  That's why I'm not going to forget Arpaio now that he's retired, driven out by Bloomberg and Soros money, and they want to put him in prison on top of it to send a message.
[02:55:20.828 --> 02:55:21.609]  I hope they do this to me.
[02:55:21.609 --> 02:55:22.970]  People won't forget me.
[02:55:22.970 --> 02:55:25.492]  So in closing, what do we do to help on this?
[02:55:25.492 --> 02:55:28.794]  I'm talking to his lawyer right now.
[02:55:28.794 --> 02:55:30.515]  What do we do, sir, to counter
[02:55:32.813 --> 02:55:42.218]  Well, I think all of us need to let our representatives in Washington know that we don't like and we don't want
[02:56:02.643 --> 02:56:12.914]  A justice department or justice department officials interfering with elections, whether they're local, state or national elections.
[02:56:12.914 --> 02:56:17.178]  The Justice Department needs to stay out of those matters.
[02:56:17.178 --> 02:56:24.006]  Number one on a on the matter pertaining to Sheriff Arpaio himself.
[02:56:24.006 --> 02:56:25.147]  Sheriff Arpaio just.
[02:56:26.616 --> 02:56:44.453]  Needs and wants everybody's support to know that people do support him that no one buys into this ruling that he's guilty because the sheriff is a very proud man and the sheriff has an enormous amount of integrity.
[02:56:44.453 --> 02:56:44.774]  He is
[02:56:46.559 --> 02:56:52.500]  Probably, if not the most honest, one of the most honest people I have ever met in my life.
[02:56:52.500 --> 02:56:56.021]  Sure, he's definitely an old-timer in that respect, and that's a good thing.
[02:56:56.021 --> 02:57:04.583]  Just briefly, folks, explain what happened with the so-called contempt he's, the judge, Judge Jury Executioner, that Judge Dredd has found him guilty of.
[02:57:04.583 --> 02:57:14.586]  Yeah, well now, he's, the judge in her ruling set a date in October for
[02:57:15.535 --> 02:57:17.316]  His sentencing.
[02:57:17.316 --> 02:57:18.637]  Why in October?
[02:57:18.637 --> 02:57:19.677]  We have no idea.
[02:57:19.677 --> 02:57:22.158]  We're going to ask her to move that up.
[02:57:22.158 --> 02:57:25.860]  The sheriff's 85 years old and he certainly wants some finality.
[02:57:25.860 --> 02:57:27.781]  Well, let me tell you, they're planning a coup against Trump.
[02:57:27.781 --> 02:57:29.742]  It's been announced.
[02:57:29.742 --> 02:57:30.783]  Well, yeah.
[02:57:30.783 --> 02:57:34.284]  You know, this just will not end.
[02:57:34.284 --> 02:57:37.206]  They're not, they don't want to leave him alone.
[02:57:37.206 --> 02:57:38.847]  They want to, they want to.
[02:57:38.847 --> 02:57:40.067]  That sounds insane.
[02:57:40.067 --> 02:57:43.529]  Brennan said they're going to have a coup on TV last week.
[02:57:44.915 --> 02:57:47.397]  Oh yeah.
[02:57:47.397 --> 02:57:57.124]  If that type of rhetoric had been used against any other president, and especially Barack Obama, there would be rioting in the street.
[02:57:57.124 --> 02:58:08.832]  But somehow, the people who don't like Trump feel that they are entitled to essentially overthrow the government of the United States.
[02:58:08.832 --> 02:58:09.433]  It's shocking.
[02:58:11.249 --> 02:58:12.030]  It's incredible.
[02:58:12.030 --> 02:58:14.292]  I mean, specifically though, we only have 45 seconds.
[02:58:14.292 --> 02:58:16.854]  Tell them how they found him in contempt.
[02:58:16.854 --> 02:58:18.616]  Oh, she found him in contempt.
[02:58:18.616 --> 02:58:20.077]  There are three elements.
[02:58:20.077 --> 02:58:22.539]  The order must be clear and definite.
[02:58:22.539 --> 02:58:30.766]  The defendant must have notice and understanding of the order and he must willfully disobey it.
[02:58:30.766 --> 02:58:32.528]  What was he disobeying, supposedly?
[02:58:34.214 --> 02:58:42.222]  A preliminary injunction order by a judge in another court, which was anything but clear and definite, that was never proved in the case.
[02:58:42.222 --> 02:58:42.942]  Sure, absolutely.
[02:58:42.942 --> 02:58:45.525]  So he said, I'm going to do my job in arresting illegals.
[02:58:45.525 --> 02:58:47.707]  So they're trying to put him in prison.
[02:58:47.707 --> 02:58:48.408]  It's incredible.
[02:58:48.408 --> 02:58:48.688]  All right.
[02:58:48.688 --> 02:58:51.010]  Thank you so much, Mark, for that.
[02:58:51.010 --> 02:58:52.572]  We'll be right back with The Fourth Hour.
[02:58:52.572 --> 02:58:53.312]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.312 --> 02:58:53.813]  Spread the word.
[02:58:57.012 --> 02:59:02.634]  Today, I'm excited to announce that a new limited shipment of DNA Force has finally arrived at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[02:59:02.634 --> 02:59:11.536]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list who've signed up for AutoShip to receive out-of-stock products like DNA Force, and we are now once again expected to sell out very, very soon.
[02:59:11.536 --> 02:59:19.198]  When it comes to a formula that is such a game-changer like DNA Force, we never know when we will be able to secure an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[02:59:19.198 --> 02:59:25.340]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ10, systematic enzymes,
[02:59:25.680 --> 02:59:28.742]  NAR Lipoic Acid, Bio PQQ and many others.
[02:59:28.742 --> 02:59:33.446]  Bio PQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies.
[02:59:33.446 --> 02:59:37.209]  And just one batch of this stuff costs us more than $30,000.
[02:59:37.209 --> 02:59:39.951]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com and read the reviews for yourself.
[02:59:39.951 --> 02:59:48.077]  Over 700 reviews have given DNA Force an unheard of 4.8 out of 5 stars through our third-party certified review agency, Power Review.
[02:59:48.077 --> 02:59:53.641]  Take advantage of this new limited shipment and get DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com before it sells out again.
[02:59:53.641 --> 02:59:54.782]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:59.480 --> 03:00:02.069]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:19.432 --> 03:00:24.294]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:00:24.294 --> 03:00:25.975]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:00:25.975 --> 03:00:27.636]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:27.636 --> 03:00:35.299]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:35.299 --> 03:00:46.844]  As I have said thousands of times, if you debate the censors, the all-high appointed leftist witch-hunt commandants,
[03:00:48.975 --> 03:00:55.097]  And say, I'm not racist, don't censor me, they've already won.
[03:00:55.097 --> 03:00:58.277]  They're not supposed to be in the position of censoring.
[03:00:58.277 --> 03:00:59.878]  We're in Western society.
[03:00:59.878 --> 03:01:05.099]  Unless you're calling for violence against somebody, you have free speech.
[03:01:05.099 --> 03:01:09.020]  But they're the ones calling for violence, but notice they're saying, we don't have free speech.
[03:01:10.677 --> 03:01:14.098]  And they always turn it around to, like, oh, you hate people.
[03:01:14.098 --> 03:01:16.459]  I don't hate men that think they're women or vice versa.
[03:01:16.459 --> 03:01:18.000]  And if people want to do that, that's their issue.
[03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:21.121]  I'm a libertarian.
[03:01:21.121 --> 03:01:23.922]  I don't want to pay for your sex change via taxes.
[03:01:23.922 --> 03:01:27.084]  I don't want to pay to have your wisdom teeth removed.
[03:01:27.084 --> 03:01:30.905]  I don't want to pay for you to have... What is it where they suck the fat out?
[03:01:30.905 --> 03:01:32.366]  Liposuction.
[03:01:32.366 --> 03:01:33.486]  Duh!
[03:01:33.486 --> 03:01:36.627]  But they got the headlines, Jones is a homophobe.
[03:01:36.627 --> 03:01:39.969]  Why, right here, he said that a man that had a baby wasn't a man.
[03:01:41.380 --> 03:01:45.263]  Because it said it was a woman that thought she was a man that then got pregnant.
[03:01:45.263 --> 03:01:48.846]  She's a woman!
[03:01:48.846 --> 03:01:55.491]  You don't put a blue bow on a whale that's a male and say it's a female.
[03:01:55.491 --> 03:01:59.535]  You don't look at a male walrus and say it's a female.
[03:01:59.535 --> 03:02:00.255]  Or vice versa.
[03:02:00.255 --> 03:02:02.377]  You don't have a female walrus saying she's a male.
[03:02:02.377 --> 03:02:03.678]  I mean, this is mental illness.
[03:02:03.678 --> 03:02:06.300]  But then they sit there and look at it and they say, no, you're crazy.
[03:02:06.300 --> 03:02:08.442]  Look how crazy Jones is.
[03:02:08.442 --> 03:02:10.584]  He said this woman that thought she was a
[03:02:11.715 --> 03:02:20.259]  This man had a baby, but they said this man did have a baby.
[03:02:20.259 --> 03:02:23.300]  This man was a woman that identifies as a man.
[03:02:23.300 --> 03:02:24.761]  It's like magic talk.
[03:02:24.761 --> 03:02:28.502]  I'm a 20-foot giraffe with purple spots!
[03:02:28.502 --> 03:02:35.085]  And when I go to the bathroom, Lucky Charms comes out golden rainbows.
[03:02:35.085 --> 03:02:40.188]  I'm a 50-foot red-purple striped giraffe.
[03:02:41.698 --> 03:02:45.840]  When I go to the bathroom and I give birth to leprechauns.
[03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:51.223]  And if you don't agree to that, you're insane, you're crazy, because I control things, I'm magical.
[03:02:51.223 --> 03:02:53.464]  And I told you this was going further.
[03:02:53.464 --> 03:02:56.546]  Look at this story, up on Infowars.com, Daily Caller.
[03:02:56.546 --> 03:03:05.431]  It links through to the Toronto newspapers and others that with straight faces report this like it's a good thing.
[03:03:05.431 --> 03:03:08.893]  All over the world there's biology professors, a lot of them are liberals.
[03:03:08.893 --> 03:03:10.834]  And they're going, no, I'm not going to call a man a woman.
[03:03:11.676 --> 03:03:13.456]  No, I'm not going to say a woman's a man.
[03:03:13.456 --> 03:03:14.156]  No.
[03:03:14.156 --> 03:03:14.857]  No.
[03:03:14.857 --> 03:03:16.197]  No.
[03:03:16.197 --> 03:03:21.438]  If someone wants to body modify and they want to mentally say that's them, that's one thing.
[03:03:21.438 --> 03:03:28.399]  Just like if I want to claim I'm a dog, and there are people that do that, we're just not going to pay to take care of you.
[03:03:28.399 --> 03:03:35.480]  And the other thing, when you blind yourself and the government pays for you to identify as a blind person, that's called sabotaging civilization.
[03:03:35.480 --> 03:03:37.101]  That's why it's being funded.
[03:03:37.101 --> 03:03:38.801]  That's been declassified!
[03:03:40.979 --> 03:03:50.146]  In the family, in independence, in people being motivated, introduce these systems that disturb things.
[03:03:50.146 --> 03:03:53.609]  You don't identify as a blind person, you're a mental patient.
[03:03:53.609 --> 03:03:54.129]  Update!
[03:03:54.129 --> 03:04:00.134]  Google and YouTube ban professor who refused to use gender neutral pronouns.
[03:04:00.134 --> 03:04:07.240]  You gotta say G and Z. Canadian professor refused to use gender neutral pronouns and criticized social justice issues.
[03:04:07.240 --> 03:04:09.582]  A professor in Canada refused to use gender neutral pronouns.
[03:04:10.433 --> 03:04:16.675]  and criticizes social justice images, has been banned from using his Google and YouTube accounts.
[03:04:16.675 --> 03:04:23.776]  Professor Jordan B. Peterson of the University of Toronto disputed Google and YouTube's decision to lock him out of his accounts.
[03:04:23.776 --> 03:04:31.898]  Please tell me what principle I violated, said Peterson in the email to Google upon discovering he was locked out of his account.
[03:04:31.898 --> 03:04:38.740]  The psychology professor has over 300,000 subscribers on the YouTube channel, which he uses as a platform to post his lectures, interviews, and Q&A.
[03:04:40.114 --> 03:04:49.041]  And they got all these psychologists, biologists and others who are being run out of campuses.
[03:04:49.041 --> 03:04:56.847]  Because they look at you and they go, listen, you're not a man when you've got a uterus and you can have a baby.
[03:04:56.847 --> 03:05:03.151]  It's okay for you to want to say you're a man, but we're not going to sit here and agree with you because you're mentally ill.
[03:05:03.151 --> 03:05:03.852]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:06.539 --> 03:05:08.100]  Duty, honor, country.
[03:05:08.100 --> 03:05:14.303]  Those three hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought to be, what you can be, what you will be.
[03:05:14.303 --> 03:05:16.564]  They are your rallying points.
[03:05:16.564 --> 03:05:19.025]  To build courage when courage seems to fail.
[03:05:19.025 --> 03:05:22.567]  To regain faith when there seems to be little cause for faith.
[03:05:22.567 --> 03:05:23.848]  To create hope when hope
[03:05:23.988 --> 03:05:25.589]  ...becomes forlorn.
[03:05:25.589 --> 03:05:34.517]  Unhappily, I possess neither that eloquence of dictation, that poetry of imagination, nor that brilliance of metaphor to tell you all that they mean.
[03:05:34.517 --> 03:05:38.961]  The unbelievers will say they are but words, but a slogan, but a flamboyant phrase.
[03:05:39.261 --> 03:05:50.930]  Every demagogue, every cynic, every hypocrite, every troublemaker, and I am sorry to say some others of an entirely different character will try to downgrade them even to the extent of mockery and ridicule.
[03:05:50.930 --> 03:05:52.911]  But these are some of the things they do.
[03:05:52.911 --> 03:05:54.613]  They build your basic character.
[03:05:54.613 --> 03:05:58.856]  They mold you for the future roles as the custodians of the nation's defense.
[03:05:59.156 --> 03:06:03.801]  This was said on May 12, 1962 by General Douglas MacArthur.
[03:06:03.801 --> 03:06:06.184]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[03:06:06.184 --> 03:06:16.775]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:06:16.775 --> 03:06:18.617]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[03:06:18.817 --> 03:06:21.698]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[03:06:21.698 --> 03:06:23.179]  It's made in the USA.
[03:06:23.179 --> 03:06:30.002]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[03:06:30.002 --> 03:06:32.083]  It is a classical 360 win.
[03:06:32.083 --> 03:06:41.787]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:06:41.787 --> 03:06:46.789]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that
[03:06:46.889 --> 03:06:58.593]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:06:58.593 --> 03:07:01.895]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[03:07:01.895 --> 03:07:05.036]  Now it's time to change our bodies, with Z Field, at Infowarslive.com.
[03:07:05.916 --> 03:07:11.619]  Rediscover your fire with the EcoZoom Coal Rocket Camping Stove.

[03:07:19.624 --> 03:07:22.785]  And that means big power in a portable package.
[03:07:22.785 --> 03:07:28.809]  The Versa cooks fast, it produces less smoke, and it's fuel efficient.
[03:07:28.809 --> 03:07:32.971]  No wonder the Versa is the most popular model in America.
[03:07:33.391 --> 03:07:39.433]  It's the ultimate stove for camping, outdoor cooking, or emergency preparedness.
[03:07:39.433 --> 03:07:46.015]  All it takes is a handful of sticks or charcoal, you got yourself an entire meal.

[03:08:00.581 --> 03:08:04.544]  Available right now at, you guessed it, Infowarestore.com.
[03:08:24.785 --> 03:08:26.046]  This is Clone Radio.
[03:08:26.046 --> 03:08:28.628]  We play the songs that sound more like everyone else.
[03:08:28.628 --> 03:08:30.009]  That's right, folks.
[03:08:30.009 --> 03:08:33.391]  It's Roger Stone coming up.
[03:08:33.391 --> 03:08:34.672]  Hitler took the guns.
[03:08:34.672 --> 03:08:35.933]  Big Alabama race.
[03:08:35.933 --> 03:08:36.973]  Mao took the guns.
[03:08:36.973 --> 03:08:38.454]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[03:08:38.454 --> 03:08:42.417]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[03:08:42.417 --> 03:08:47.861]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[03:08:47.861 --> 03:08:50.863]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[03:08:58.216 --> 03:09:04.878]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, the Obama
[03:09:19.978 --> 03:09:27.410]  White House set up a law firm to sue patriots and to stop the Trump revolution while they've sued the president and Roger Stone.
[03:09:27.410 --> 03:09:33.620]  He's got very exciting updates on that front with their whole fake legal case with literally no proof saying he hacked.
[03:09:34.392 --> 03:09:37.895]  The DNC gave the information to WikiLeaks.
[03:09:37.895 --> 03:09:39.337]  Totally insane.
[03:09:39.337 --> 03:09:43.561]  We have two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Cy Hirsch coming out.
[03:09:43.561 --> 03:09:45.803]  The story is on Infowars.com.
[03:09:45.803 --> 03:09:56.133]  Media completely ignores bombshell Seymour Hirsch revelations on Seth Rich identifying him according to Cy Hirsch's FBI, NSA sources.
[03:09:56.133 --> 03:09:58.756]  High level that he's had for a decade.
[03:10:00.379 --> 03:10:03.642]  Ladies and gentlemen, it was Seth Rich.
[03:10:03.642 --> 03:10:06.025]  He's been in contact not just with the FBI, but with...
[03:10:07.165 --> 03:10:11.929]  Julian Assange, well Julian Assange already told us when Seth Rich got killed, back in July.
[03:10:11.929 --> 03:10:13.970]  He said, look, he was our source.
[03:10:13.970 --> 03:10:19.454]  We can't officially say it, we never give out sources, but you can believe it should be investigated.
[03:10:19.454 --> 03:10:30.002]  So we have Julian Assange, we have Cy Hirsch, we have just absolute evidence and that's why they're so scared and why they don't want any discussion of the Seth Rich murder.
[03:10:30.002 --> 03:10:31.824]  They act like the guy never existed now.
[03:10:32.304 --> 03:10:40.549]  Now we've got exciting races against Democrats around the country and against neocons and Roger showed us a special guest that he's about to bring up right now.
[03:10:40.549 --> 03:10:43.051]  We're going to skip the next break so Roger gets this time back.
[03:10:43.051 --> 03:10:46.693]  But Roger, I know you're going to break this down after your next guest leaves us.
[03:10:46.693 --> 03:10:47.954]  This is amazing.
[03:10:50.484 --> 03:11:19.435]  Alex, I mean, Seymour Hersh, New York Times, Pulitzer Prize winner, one of the most respected investigative reporters in the country, now reveals to us that not only was Seth Rich the most likely source of the WikiLeaks documents, last week William Binney and others came forward to say that they have technical evidence that most of the material from the Democratic National Committee was not hacked at all, but downloaded to thumb drives
[03:11:19.975 --> 03:11:38.564]  Spirited out of the building by rich most likely sold by the way, but we also know That that a British diplomat came forward and claimed that he was essentially the mule that took those things To Julian Assange so the entire Russian hacking
[03:11:39.444 --> 03:11:53.377]  Meme or narrative as put together by John Podesta and the Democrats is collapsing before your very eyes and then of course you have the relationship of the Awan brothers and where they fit into this.
[03:11:53.377 --> 03:11:57.842]  We're going to be getting into all of that and more right here at InfoWars.
[03:11:59.658 --> 03:12:15.610]  I do want to point out that one of the opportunities, in my opinion, through the failure of the healthcare effort last week, is that President Trump may now realize that the establishment Republicans are not really for him.
[03:12:16.471 --> 03:12:20.174]  And that voters could really make a difference.
[03:12:20.174 --> 03:12:38.269]  The President has a unique opportunity to thwart the Republican establishment and go into these states and districts, take on incumbent Republicans who are not with the program, not only clean up the Republican Party, return it to being a party of nationalism and the middle class, but also
[03:12:39.551 --> 03:12:46.402]  Sparking fear in the hearts of the establishment Republicans who are backstabbing him on health care.
[03:12:46.402 --> 03:12:48.606]  Joining me now is General...
[03:12:50.535 --> 03:12:52.016]  Hey, it's great to be on today, Roger.
[03:13:21.261 --> 03:13:32.693]  You made a trip recently to Alabama and I want to talk about that because this is a classic case of where fear could be struck in the hearts of the Republican establishment.
[03:13:32.693 --> 03:13:33.834]  The appointed U.S.
[03:13:33.834 --> 03:13:41.202]  Senator Luther Strange, a former Attorney General, has the support of Mitch McConnell and the Republican establishment.
[03:13:41.642 --> 03:13:44.623]  He is awash in special interest money.
[03:13:44.623 --> 03:14:00.608]  They have managed to postpone several inquiries into unethical activity, including taking a bribe to look the other way on a major environmental issue in his state, using Attorney General campaign money for the U.S.
[03:14:00.608 --> 03:14:01.409]  Senate race.
[03:14:01.409 --> 03:14:04.370]  We're going to postpone that all till after the election, folks.
[03:14:04.370 --> 03:14:08.631]  So, Colonel, tell us why you went to Alabama and tell us the situation.
[03:14:09.858 --> 03:14:11.439]  Well, I was up there last week.
[03:14:11.439 --> 03:14:15.602]  In fact, I communicate with the campaign again today.
[03:14:15.602 --> 03:14:20.826]  I was up there, I guess, two weeks ago for most of the week.
[03:14:20.826 --> 03:14:30.173]  And obviously what we have is a special election, the primary, to replace the seat that was held by the new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions.
[03:14:30.882 --> 03:14:35.484]  And it is going to be a critical decision for Alabama.
[03:14:35.484 --> 03:14:42.568]  And you're right, he's running against an appointed incumbent named Luther Strange.
[03:14:42.568 --> 03:14:50.312]  Luther was the former AG who was investigating the governor, and then the governor appointed him to take the vacant Senate seat.
[03:14:51.215 --> 03:14:58.281]  So, they now are having this special election, but there's a lot going on there, a lot on the ground, just like you touched on.
[03:14:58.281 --> 03:15:00.523]  You also have Bo Brooks, who's a sitting U.S.
[03:15:00.523 --> 03:15:02.625]  Congressman, and he's in that race.
[03:15:02.625 --> 03:15:04.547]  Never Trump.
[03:15:04.547 --> 03:15:05.067]  Never Trump.
[03:15:05.067 --> 03:15:05.668]  Ever Trumper.
[03:15:05.668 --> 03:15:11.453]  And you have a former Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, Ray Moore, who's in that race.
[03:15:12.296 --> 03:15:24.483]  And then you have Dr. Randy Brinson, who's really the true outsider and conservative and is pro-Trump and wants to help the President achieve his agenda to make America great again.
[03:15:24.483 --> 03:15:28.065]  And he's also a physician and a lay minister.
[03:15:29.384 --> 03:15:30.846]  And I want to make one thing very clear.
[03:15:30.846 --> 03:15:41.282]  No one here at InfoWars, not Roger Stone, not Colonel McAllister, no one at InfoWars has any financial or consulting or business relationship.
[03:15:41.282 --> 03:15:44.407]  I'm supporting Randy Brinson because he supported Donald Trump.
[03:15:44.907 --> 03:15:53.035]  Because he was with Trump early, and because I want to strike fear in the heart of Mitch McConnell.
[03:15:53.035 --> 03:16:02.305]  These establishment Republicans, these rhinos, must know that you can't cross Donald Trump with impunity, that there is some consequence.
[03:16:02.825 --> 03:16:08.952]  Now, Colonel McAllister, I know a lot of my friends here in Florida would like to see you run for public office.
[03:16:08.952 --> 03:16:11.415]  I know you looked at the, I guess, the U.S.
[03:16:11.415 --> 03:16:17.783]  Senate, and then when Senator Marco Rubio reversed himself, decided not to retire, he pulled back.
[03:16:17.783 --> 03:16:20.166]  But what's on your horizon?
[03:16:21.363 --> 03:16:26.288]  Well, actually, I ran in the Senate primary and lost to Connie Mack, and then he lost to Bill Nelson.
[03:16:26.288 --> 03:16:26.728]  Excellent.
[03:16:26.728 --> 03:16:33.856]  But, you know, right now what we're doing is we're trying to reach out and support pro-Trump candidates.
[03:16:33.856 --> 03:16:37.980]  You know, I am the national spokesman for Citizens for Trump.
[03:16:37.980 --> 03:16:41.183]  We're involved in this Senate race in Alabama.
[03:16:41.183 --> 03:16:45.067]  We're going to be looking at some governor races, maybe key congressional races.
[03:16:45.587 --> 03:16:47.008]  So right now, I'm focused on that.
[03:16:47.008 --> 03:16:48.588]  But I will say this, Roger.
[03:16:48.588 --> 03:16:51.169]  You know, having run for governor, I lost to Rick Scott.
[03:16:51.169 --> 03:16:52.170]  Having run for U.S.
[03:16:52.170 --> 03:17:01.794]  Senate, I am always open, though, and willing to step up anytime I have a chance to serve this great state of Florida and this great nation.
[03:17:01.794 --> 03:17:04.835]  So I'm keeping all those options open.
[03:17:04.835 --> 03:17:13.199]  Right now, we're focused on trying to get people in office that can support the president and help him move America forward and get the swamp right.
[03:17:14.502 --> 03:17:20.688]  Well, as you know, Abraham Lincoln lost a House race and a Senate race back-to-back before going to the White House.
[03:17:20.688 --> 03:17:22.809]  So I'm delighted to hear that you're not encouraged.
[03:17:22.809 --> 03:17:31.057]  We need good men and women like you who are not globalists, who are not afraid of the Republican establishment.
[03:17:31.057 --> 03:17:39.865]  Owen Shoyer here at Infowars helped us identify Omar Navarro, who I think is one of the most promising young reform candidates out there.
[03:17:40.685 --> 03:18:06.690]  And one of the things I want to do here at InfoWars is to spotlight patriots who are running, patriots who are down with the Trump reform agenda, patriots who are unafraid to call out Islamic terrorism when they see it, patriots who will stand up for a strong national defense, but to turn away from this neocon foreign policy of going around the globe looking for trouble.
[03:18:07.710 --> 03:18:12.615]  Are there any other races that you want to mention here before we move on?
[03:18:12.615 --> 03:18:15.678]  Because it's such a fast, news-breaking day.
[03:18:15.678 --> 03:18:21.343]  You've got developments on the Awan brothers and the Seth Rich murder.
[03:18:21.343 --> 03:18:26.228]  You have an analysis coming up of the new Trump White House and what's going on there.
[03:18:26.228 --> 03:18:29.932]  So, Colonel McAllister, you've got the floor here for a minute.
[03:18:29.932 --> 03:18:32.234]  Tell us what else you see on the horizon.
[03:18:33.203 --> 03:18:39.689]  Well, I think that 2018, and I think you would agree, Roger, is going to be a pivotal year.
[03:18:39.689 --> 03:18:48.536]  And the Democrats are obviously looking at how to rebound and how to regain a base and use it as a launch pad for 2020.
[03:18:49.958 --> 03:19:00.845]  And living right here in Florida, like you and I both do, it's the biggest swing state in the nation, has 29 electoral votes, and we have a full plate of elections in 2018.
[03:19:00.845 --> 03:19:02.146]  We have the U.S.
[03:19:02.146 --> 03:19:06.469]  Senate race to replace Bill Nelson, which is going to be a high priority.
[03:19:06.469 --> 03:19:08.170]  All 27 of U.S.
[03:19:08.170 --> 03:19:11.312]  Congress races will again be up for re-election.
[03:19:11.312 --> 03:19:17.316]  But we're also going to have a governor and the entire governor's cabinet in Florida will be up for re-election in 2018.
[03:19:18.672 --> 03:19:33.197]  So I'm pretty sure the Democrats are aware of that and they're probably looking at if we could seize momentum in a key swing state like Florida, it could give us a launch pad for 2020 to try to take the White House back.
[03:19:33.197 --> 03:19:47.002]  So I look for them to have a big effort and a big emphasis and focus on Florida in 2018 to keep Bill Nelson in office and to regain the governor's mansion and use those as a launch pad to regain the White House in 2020.
[03:19:49.042 --> 03:19:50.543]  Well, well said.
[03:19:50.543 --> 03:19:54.725]  You know, folks, if you're not a member of Citizens for Trump, go online and sign up.
[03:19:54.725 --> 03:19:59.927]  This is one of the greatest, most vibrant, most robust grassroots organizations.
[03:19:59.927 --> 03:20:05.830]  Doesn't cost you anything to join, but they will tell you where the hot spots are in the country.
[03:20:05.830 --> 03:20:11.012]  This is where my friends Mike Cernovich and Jack Sobiak came from.
[03:20:11.012 --> 03:20:14.294]  This is the wellspring of those who couldn't get
[03:20:14.734 --> 03:20:17.595]  A response from the Trump campaign.
[03:20:17.595 --> 03:20:22.276]  So they went out and they built their own grassroots organization.
[03:20:22.276 --> 03:20:24.617]  And it is a great group, folks.
[03:20:24.617 --> 03:20:27.598]  I'm going to be speaking to them on the 12th in Atlanta.
[03:20:27.598 --> 03:20:31.879]  If you're not a member, I urge you to sign up and follow their activities.
[03:20:31.879 --> 03:20:36.720]  We are fully supportive here of Citizens for Trump.
[03:20:36.720 --> 03:20:40.201]  Colonel, thank you for joining us and God bless America.
[03:20:40.201 --> 03:20:42.302]  And thank you for your service to our country.
[03:20:43.444 --> 03:20:44.865]  Thanks for having me on, Roger.
[03:20:44.865 --> 03:20:48.666]  I'd be pleased to be back with your program anytime.
[03:20:48.666 --> 03:20:50.907]  Many, many thanks.
[03:20:50.907 --> 03:20:57.870]  Let us move on now because I've never seen a news cycle like this where there's so much breaking.
[03:20:57.870 --> 03:21:02.312]  It's impossible for us here at InfoWars to keep up with the developments.
[03:21:02.312 --> 03:21:09.975]  As Alex Jones said in the opening, the media seems to have completely elevated this phony story about Donald Trump.
[03:21:10.815 --> 03:21:39.995]  Uh, you know, trying to manage fallout from the bogus story about his son's meeting with a Russian lawyer, uh, who seems to have been let into the country by the FBI despite any, uh, presence of a visa, uh, and who now has been tied directly to Fusion GPS, uh, and, uh, photos of her that we've obtained here at InfoWars at Hillary Clinton, uh, demonstrations, photos of the woman lawyer in Senator John McCain's office.
[03:21:40.835 --> 03:21:45.059]  The words set up look pretty apparent to me.
[03:21:45.059 --> 03:21:47.961]  This smells more and more like a set up.
[03:21:47.961 --> 03:21:50.503]  But let's be absolutely clear.
[03:21:50.503 --> 03:21:55.067]  There's nothing illegal nor improper with Donald Trump Jr.
[03:21:55.067 --> 03:22:04.394]  or the leadership of the Trump campaign meeting with a person who comes forward to claims that they have documented evidence of wrongdoing.
[03:22:04.394 --> 03:22:05.855]  No evidence existed.
[03:22:06.616 --> 03:22:29.912]  I was on a panel at Politicon with Jill Weinvolner, the former Watergate special prosecutor, a very learned and attractive and I would say articulate woman, but her claim that there was a campaign violation, that there was something of value was given to Trump Jr.
[03:22:29.912 --> 03:22:33.854]  and therefore there was a violation of the law is a bogus argument.
[03:22:33.854 --> 03:22:35.976]  Nothing whatsoever was given.
[03:22:36.636 --> 03:22:37.557]  Donald Trump Jr.
[03:22:37.557 --> 03:22:40.861]  was targeted because he's a follower of InfoWars.
[03:22:40.861 --> 03:22:42.142]  Donald Trump Jr.
[03:22:42.142 --> 03:22:50.471]  is one who often retweets some of the better stories here produced by Alex Jones and the crew at InfoWars.
[03:22:50.471 --> 03:22:51.873]  He's a patriot.
[03:22:51.873 --> 03:22:55.116]  He's not afraid to support and defend his father.
[03:22:55.697 --> 03:23:02.999]  And that's why they have targeted him, not because he has done anything whatsoever that is improper.
[03:23:02.999 --> 03:23:22.446]  But they elevate that story, at the same time we choose to ignore Pulitzer Prize-winning author Seymour Hersh, formerly of the New York Times, where he won a Pulitzer for the My Lai story of Vietnam, which related, of course, to murders by the U.S.
[03:23:22.446 --> 03:23:23.006]  military.
[03:23:24.126 --> 03:23:44.006]  He believes, Hirsch this is, that not only was Rich's murder not a robbery gone wrong, but that Rich was the source for WikiLeaks, that he was loading material to a Dropbox where WikiLeaks and perhaps others
[03:23:44.847 --> 03:23:46.888]  Got access.
[03:23:46.888 --> 03:24:02.155]  Additionally, he says that along with William Binney and others, there is now extraordinary evidence that there was minimal, perhaps no hacking whatsoever of the DNC.
[03:24:02.155 --> 03:24:14.041]  That the data was mostly downloaded from a to a thumb drive and passed on through intermediaries or put up on a Dropbox where WikiLeaks
[03:24:16.101 --> 03:24:27.963]  Now, as you know, Julian Assange, within the keeping of most journalists I know, is not in a position to disclose his sources.
[03:24:27.963 --> 03:24:40.726]  But when he offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to the murder of Seth Rich, to me that was a pretty clear indicator that Rich was, in fact, one of his sources.
[03:24:40.726 --> 03:24:42.766]  Additionally, you'll notice that WikiLeaks
[03:24:43.286 --> 03:24:44.668]  Julian Assange is a very clever man.
[03:24:44.668 --> 03:24:45.529]  He's a journalist.
[03:24:45.529 --> 03:24:47.512]  And no folks, he does not work for the Russians.
[03:25:00.289 --> 03:25:15.458]  The question of Rich's murder, well, it is believed by Hirsch that John Brennan, the Islamist convert who served as CIA director under Barack Obama and George W. Bush,
[03:25:16.098 --> 03:25:23.266]  Was behind this entire operation, both the operation to steal the data and blame it on Russia.
[03:25:23.266 --> 03:25:28.811]  We also know that there is an enormous mixing of apples and oranges.
[03:25:28.811 --> 03:25:36.339]  As far as the emails from the DNC is concerned, there is no evidence that that information was hacked and stolen.
[03:25:37.300 --> 03:25:51.849]  What was put online by Guccifer 2.0, who may not even be a Romanian, never mind a Russian, because his software actually traces to an individual who worked at the DNC.
[03:25:51.849 --> 03:25:56.612]  And what he uncovered was Donald Trump opposition research.
[03:25:57.472 --> 03:26:21.620]  So, in other words, he gave WikiLeaks, or someone gave WikiLeaks, negative information about Donald Trump, but the taggings, the markings of that, which are indisputable, don't track back to a Guccifer 2.0, they track back to a fellow named Wofford, I believe it is, who worked at the Democratic National Committee.
[03:26:25.270 --> 03:26:28.692]  The thick platens, as they say.
[03:26:28.692 --> 03:26:32.255]  And now you have the question of the Awan brothers.
[03:26:32.255 --> 03:26:34.216]  What to make of this?
[03:26:34.216 --> 03:26:35.637]  You've read about the Awan brothers.
[03:26:35.637 --> 03:26:41.421]  These are the two Pakistanis who came first to work for Deborah Wasserman Schultz.
[03:26:42.344 --> 03:26:42.584]  I think?
[03:27:00.197 --> 03:27:06.700]  Primary votes in California between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders still not counted.
[03:27:06.700 --> 03:27:08.540]  The count goes on.
[03:27:08.540 --> 03:27:10.841]  Unbelievably, Donald Trump is president.
[03:27:10.841 --> 03:27:18.984]  The election has been over six months, but officials in the California Democratic Party can't count all the primary ballots out there in the Golden State.
[03:27:18.984 --> 03:27:19.505]  You know why?
[03:27:20.452 --> 03:27:23.274]  Because Hillary Clinton lost, that's why.
[03:27:23.274 --> 03:27:28.238]  And because the shift of those delegates would move the nomination to Bernie Sanders.
[03:27:28.238 --> 03:27:32.501]  So that's why you have a cover-up going on there.
[03:27:32.501 --> 03:27:39.286]  I would say that the Awan brother problems for Debra Wasserman Schultz are just beginning.
[03:27:39.286 --> 03:27:49.574]  The two brothers worked for over 30 individual members of Congress, performing sensitive IT tasks that gave them access to top-secret and classified information.
[03:27:50.578 --> 03:28:01.188]  The extensive list of financial and legal red flags would have prohibited any person for being denied a security clearance, but Deborah Wasserman Schultz did the unthinkable.
[03:28:01.188 --> 03:28:10.797]  When the Capitol Hill police made it clear to her that they had launched an investigation over theft from the computer system of the U.S.
[03:28:10.797 --> 03:28:12.038]  House of Representatives,
[03:28:13.024 --> 03:28:22.531]  Wasserman Schultz actually changed the classification of the Awan brothers from consultants to employees.
[03:28:22.531 --> 03:28:33.259]  That way he and she ensured that they would continue to have access to the House of Representative computers despite the fact that they were under investigation.
[03:28:34.306 --> 03:28:39.708]  I think that that is in itself collusion with a couple of felons.
[03:28:39.708 --> 03:28:40.968]  The assistant U.S.
[03:28:40.968 --> 03:28:46.891]  attorney who's overseeing the Awan family investigation is Stephen Wasserman.
[03:28:46.891 --> 03:28:48.271]  Sound familiar?
[03:28:48.271 --> 03:28:53.113]  Why, he's the brother of Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz.
[03:28:54.813 --> 03:29:06.435]  It also appears that the Awan hard drives that were given to almost 20 pieces of equipment were turned over to the Capitol Hill police and the FBI were damaged and in some cases not intact.
[03:29:06.435 --> 03:29:21.038]  So the idea that they are being blackmailed, and that is why no Democratic national congressional member will come forward to testify, smells like blackmail to me.
[03:29:21.839 --> 03:29:27.118]  Folks, it's a good time to remind you that we here at InfoWars are the tip of the spear.
[03:29:28.171 --> 03:29:37.097]  But we cannot survive and we cannot defeat the extraordinary efforts to censor us without your support.
[03:29:37.097 --> 03:29:44.363]  So I urge you to go to the Infowars.com store where we have some unbelievable late July specials.
[03:29:44.363 --> 03:29:46.584]  Super Female Vitality, $29.95, 57% off.
[03:29:46.584 --> 03:29:47.745]  Silver Bullet, one of my favorites.
[03:29:53.471 --> 03:29:54.533]  99.95, almost 66% off.
[03:29:54.533 --> 03:29:58.982]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:58.982 --> 03:30:01.647]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:06.517 --> 03:30:15.745]  The Constitutional Convention of 1787 was held in strict secrecy, and at the end of the proceedings, citizens gathered outside Independence Hall to learn what had been produced behind closed doors.
[03:30:15.745 --> 03:30:19.929]  While Benjamin Franklin was leaving the hall, a lady asked him, Well, Doctor, what have we got?
[03:30:19.929 --> 03:30:21.531]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:30:21.531 --> 03:30:24.473]  To which he responded, A republic, if you can keep it.
[03:30:24.473 --> 03:30:29.258]  But today, not only have we lost a republic, but most people don't even know what a republic even is.
[03:30:29.258 --> 03:30:31.780]  For one thing, a republic is not a democracy.
[03:30:31.940 --> 03:30:37.944]  The Republic operates under the rule of law which protects individual liberties so that the majority cannot take away the rights of the minority.
[03:30:37.944 --> 03:30:43.507]  Under a Republic, the government and its citizens all abide by the same laws regardless of political power or lack thereof.
[03:30:43.507 --> 03:30:47.630]  Democracy, on the other hand, only leads the mob rule fueled by the unrestrained whims of the public.
[03:30:47.850 --> 03:30:54.538]  In a democracy, the individual or any groups of individuals composing the minority have no protection against the unlimited power of the majority.
[03:30:54.538 --> 03:30:56.440]  It is a case of majority over man.
[03:30:56.440 --> 03:30:59.965]  In other words, under a democracy, two wolves can vote to eat the sheep for dinner.
[03:30:59.965 --> 03:31:03.489]  But under a republic, a sheep's right to life is protected by the rule of law.
[03:31:03.489 --> 03:31:05.872]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com.
[03:31:06.092 --> 03:31:14.814]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[03:31:14.814 --> 03:31:15.354]  That's right.
[03:31:15.354 --> 03:31:20.615]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rites freeze dryers.

[03:31:27.296 --> 03:31:34.538]  And let me tell you something, it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[03:31:34.878 --> 03:31:35.118]  Woo!
[03:31:35.118 --> 03:31:36.158]  That's what I'm talking about.
[03:31:36.158 --> 03:31:44.880]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[03:31:44.880 --> 03:31:54.481]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[03:31:54.481 --> 03:31:57.922]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[03:31:57.922 --> 03:32:02.023]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[03:32:02.023 --> 03:32:02.883]  So what are you waiting for?
[03:32:03.103 --> 03:32:05.944]  Check it out right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:32:05.944 --> 03:32:10.626]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[03:32:10.626 --> 03:32:23.571]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[03:32:23.571 --> 03:32:30.133]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[03:32:30.133 --> 03:32:32.594]  And so I set out to develop caveman.
[03:32:32.674 --> 03:32:43.880]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[03:32:43.880 --> 03:32:46.241]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[03:32:46.241 --> 03:32:47.722]  We're getting results.
[03:32:47.722 --> 03:32:53.825]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[03:32:53.825 --> 03:32:56.727]  Caveman is finally back at the InfoWars store.
[03:32:56.727 --> 03:33:00.409]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only.
[03:33:00.489 --> 03:33:03.010]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:03.010 --> 03:33:03.951]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:33:31.670 --> 03:33:37.012]  Thank you, and welcome back to the Alex Jones Show here on InfoWars.
[03:33:37.012 --> 03:33:48.957]  We got cut off there in the end, but I do want to say that there's a product now available at the InfoWars.com store, the True Whey Protein, which is 25% off.
[03:33:48.957 --> 03:33:51.018]  Now, folks, I want to be candid with you.
[03:33:51.018 --> 03:33:56.360]  You can go to the drugstore, you can go to the local Walgreens or CVS, and you can buy whey protein.
[03:33:57.256 --> 03:33:58.937]  But it's garbage.
[03:33:58.937 --> 03:34:03.518]  It's not the kind of quality that this protein is.
[03:34:03.518 --> 03:34:14.001]  This is a byproduct of milk and cheese that has been promoted for its health benefits, particularly for its muscle-building properties, and right now...
[03:34:15.221 --> 03:34:23.224]  There's an Ultimate Protein Pack that is 25% off both Caveman and the True Whey Protein.
[03:34:23.224 --> 03:34:25.244]  This is the best you can buy.
[03:34:25.244 --> 03:34:28.865]  The price beats anything you're going to find in the market.
[03:34:28.865 --> 03:34:43.950]  And you're not only going to be getting a product that you can count on, both great in my opinion for either a weight loss diet or a bodybuilding diet or just for health maintenance, but you're going to be helping the fight for freedom at the same time.
[03:34:45.050 --> 03:34:49.312]  This is an unbelievable kind of double deal here, folks.
[03:34:49.312 --> 03:35:01.937]  For $74.91, you're getting True Whey Protein, and you're getting Caveman, which has all the essential building blocks for optimum health and for athletic performance.
[03:35:01.937 --> 03:35:06.559]  I was skeptical about Caveman until I gave it a shot.
[03:35:06.559 --> 03:35:10.501]  I strongly recommend you grab this extraordinary protein packet.
[03:35:11.321 --> 03:35:19.384]  Pac, the benefits are extraordinary and you'll be helping fund the fight for freedom.
[03:35:19.384 --> 03:35:37.352]  We don't have a George Soros or a David Rockefeller type sitting in the background writing big checks to InfoWars to keep us on the air or to fund the incredibly exciting expansion that Alex Jones is working on.
[03:35:37.952 --> 03:35:38.372]  I don't know.
[03:36:01.135 --> 03:36:01.856]  The Globalist.
[03:36:01.856 --> 03:36:06.798]  This is how we fund the fight for the First Amendment and for freedom of the press.
[03:36:06.798 --> 03:36:22.027]  So please, take just a minute, go to the InfoWars store, look at the many fine products there, but today I recommend the Whey Protein and Caveman Combo Protein Package at an extraordinary price that's 25% off, I believe, list.
[03:36:24.588 --> 03:36:35.526]  So, moving on, let's go back to the Awan brothers, because this is the story that the mainstream media refuses to put on page one.
[03:36:36.491 --> 03:36:42.777]  There are allegations, of course, that the Awans knew Seth Rich.
[03:36:42.777 --> 03:36:48.182]  They may have, in fact, based on what sources tell me, have partied with Seth Rich.
[03:36:48.182 --> 03:36:55.610]  There's so many missing time frames in terms of the night before.
[03:36:55.610 --> 03:36:56.511]  We know the D.C.
[03:36:56.511 --> 03:36:59.213]  Metropolitan Police has made no effort to get the
[03:37:00.274 --> 03:37:07.521]  Uh, video surveillance camera footage from the last bar that Seth was in.
[03:37:07.521 --> 03:37:13.226]  They made no effort to question the people who work there, the bartender and so on.
[03:37:13.226 --> 03:37:21.955]  Uh, a blockbuster story by Dr. Jerry Corsi here on InfoWars last week shows how they purposely changed the time
[03:37:22.515 --> 03:37:34.865]  of the report of a break-in into a car in which a gun owned by the FBI was stolen to try to give the impression that there was some connection to the Seth Rich murder.
[03:37:34.865 --> 03:37:44.452]  That's the kind of investigative reporting that you see here at InfoWars, folks, but you're not going to see at the New York Times or the Washington Post.
[03:37:44.452 --> 03:37:47.515]  So, why have the New York Times
[03:37:48.275 --> 03:38:02.419]  The Washington Post and, first and foremost, the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, the major paper in Deborah Wasserman Schultz's district, given this story such scant coverage.
[03:38:02.419 --> 03:38:04.740]  What is it they are covering up?
[03:38:05.819 --> 03:38:19.172]  As I think you probably have heard, one of the Awan brothers attempted to flee the country last week, was actually pulled off of a jetliner at Dulles Airport in Washington D.C.
[03:38:19.172 --> 03:38:24.177]  by the FBI, seeking to leave the country after wiring
[03:38:25.078 --> 03:38:25.879]  At least $300,000.
[03:38:25.879 --> 03:38:36.768]  There are indications that he may have sent as much as $2 million on to Pakistan, where it appears the rest of his family fled.
[03:38:36.768 --> 03:38:42.533]  Here's the other interesting point that many in the mainstream media who are covering the story have missed.
[03:38:43.354 --> 03:38:47.538]  There's no evidence that the Awan Brothers were IT geniuses.
[03:38:47.538 --> 03:38:58.287]  They have no extensive previous IT experience that would indicate that they have the kind of capabilities that they were even selling on Capitol Hill.
[03:38:58.287 --> 03:39:02.410]  Was this a Pakistani intelligence operation?
[03:39:02.410 --> 03:39:06.474]  It looks to me like the Awan Brothers were getting technical help from someone.
[03:39:07.418 --> 03:39:12.283]  But, just as it is, the story is still Donald Trump Jr.
[03:39:12.283 --> 03:39:13.905]  Russian collusion.
[03:39:13.905 --> 03:39:25.238]  Nobody wants to talk about the Awan brothers, their alleged connection to Seth Rich, and ongoing developments in the Seth Rich murder case.
[03:39:26.687 --> 03:39:49.018]  Last week, The Atlantic, a left-wing magazine, posted an open letter from a Sandy Hook mother attacking me for simply saying on my Twitter feed, does anyone but me find it odd that Seth Rich's parents seem to have no interest in who killed their son?
[03:39:49.018 --> 03:39:50.999]  That's not over-the-top.
[03:39:50.999 --> 03:39:53.920]  That's not obnoxious or rude.
[03:39:53.920 --> 03:39:55.001]  That's common sense.
[03:39:56.087 --> 03:40:02.450]  Yes, of course the privacy of Seth Rich's parents is important.
[03:40:02.450 --> 03:40:06.193]  But the truth is more important.
[03:40:06.193 --> 03:40:11.135]  And the mainstream media effort to cover up the truth in this matter.
[03:40:11.135 --> 03:40:17.299]  Well, that's why Alex Jones said only yesterday, this case needs investigation.
[03:40:17.299 --> 03:40:19.300]  The American people need to know.
[03:40:20.350 --> 03:40:35.457]  I'm looking forward to the opportunity to testify before the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, because they operate from the get-go on the false premise that the Russians hacked the DNC's email server.
[03:40:35.457 --> 03:40:37.257]  I don't believe that's true.
[03:40:37.257 --> 03:40:42.700]  In fact, I think I can prove to the Senate and the House that it is false.
[03:40:43.851 --> 03:40:57.436]  See they operate on a set premise and the mummy dummies in the 17 intelligence agencies endlessly repeat this narrative line almost like they got a talking point memo.
[03:40:57.436 --> 03:41:04.398]  We've ascertained that the Russians hacked the DNC and that they interfered in the election.
[03:41:05.213 --> 03:41:13.638]  But they put forward no proof whatsoever that would stand up in a US court of law.
[03:41:13.638 --> 03:41:15.299]  None whatsoever.
[03:41:15.299 --> 03:41:30.967]  I also want to report to you on a very exciting trip I took to Los Angeles to stand with Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate for Congress in the 43rd District,
[03:41:32.541 --> 03:41:36.003]  Uh, facing Mad Maxine Waters.
[03:41:36.003 --> 03:41:48.390]  Now, in the, uh, in the nature of full disclosure, I want to say that I am a strategic consultant to his campaign, being paid the princely sum of one dollar.
[03:41:48.390 --> 03:41:57.056]  Uh, and I'm going to be, uh, watching this race because I think it is a template for the future.
[03:41:57.976 --> 03:42:09.139]  I give credit to Owen Shoyer as the journalist who first identified this as a key race and identified Omar Navarro as a hard charger.
[03:42:09.139 --> 03:42:13.981]  I can't tell you how impressed I am with this young man.
[03:42:13.981 --> 03:42:17.962]  And this race is not about left and right.
[03:42:17.962 --> 03:42:20.763]  It's not about globalists and nationalists.
[03:42:20.763 --> 03:42:23.283]  It's not about liberal and conservative.
[03:42:23.283 --> 03:42:25.644]  It's not about Republican and Democrat.
[03:42:26.809 --> 03:42:30.991]  It's about corruption and integrity in government.
[03:42:30.991 --> 03:42:36.153]  You see, Maxine Waters is among the most corrupt members of Congress.
[03:42:36.153 --> 03:42:38.955]  Maxine Waters put pressure on the U.S.
[03:42:38.955 --> 03:42:50.260]  government to bail out a failing bank, but never disclosed that she and her husband owned stock in that bank, and that her husband was on the board of directors.
[03:42:51.843 --> 03:42:57.110]  Maxine Waters' congressional committee has paid her daughter $600,000.
[03:42:57.110 --> 03:43:01.555]  For what?
[03:43:01.555 --> 03:43:03.537]  Her tough re-election campaigns?
[03:43:03.537 --> 03:43:05.320]  She hasn't had a race in years.
[03:43:06.513 --> 03:43:09.776]  And then they have what they call the Slate Scam.
[03:43:09.776 --> 03:43:11.637]  Let me explain that to you.
[03:43:11.637 --> 03:43:29.191]  This is where Maxine Waters and her posse create slate cards that look almost identical to the official slate card put forward by the Democratic Central Committee in the counties where she serves.
[03:43:29.191 --> 03:43:31.593]  Only this is the Maxine Waters slate.
[03:43:32.441 --> 03:43:40.667]  And if you're a down-ballot Democrat running for the Assembly or the County Commission or the City Council, well, you've got to pay up.
[03:43:40.667 --> 03:43:45.610]  And you've got to pay up big to get on the slate card.
[03:43:45.610 --> 03:43:47.432]  It's a scam, folks.
[03:43:47.432 --> 03:43:51.374]  She's using her position to make money.
[03:43:51.374 --> 03:44:00.421]  The irony of this is that Maxine Waters lives in a multi-million dollar mansion outside the district.
[03:44:01.337 --> 03:44:05.800]  She lives in the very affluent Hancock Park.
[03:44:05.800 --> 03:44:15.205]  She is eating filet mignon while her constituents can barely afford carne asada.
[03:44:15.205 --> 03:44:19.768]  This is among the poorest, most destitute districts in the country.
[03:44:20.919 --> 03:44:23.000]  The schools are terrible.
[03:44:23.000 --> 03:44:25.262]  They're like prisons.
[03:44:25.262 --> 03:44:28.584]  The streets and neighborhoods are unsafe.
[03:44:28.584 --> 03:44:33.147]  You take your life in your hands to go to some parts of this district.
[03:44:33.147 --> 03:44:35.149]  There are no jobs.
[03:44:35.149 --> 03:44:38.071]  There is no opportunity.
[03:44:38.071 --> 03:44:42.413]  There is no possibility of upward mobility.
[03:44:42.413 --> 03:44:47.257]  All there is is abject poverty and desolation.
[03:44:48.547 --> 03:44:51.814]  Yes, Maxine Water and her husband, there's their mansion.
[03:44:51.814 --> 03:44:58.748]  They live high on the hog, while their constituents are among the poorest folks in the nation.
[03:45:01.061 --> 03:45:13.966]  I have no doubt whatsoever that Omar Navarro will work to bring opportunity and safety and a better standard of living and better schools to this district.
[03:45:13.966 --> 03:45:16.707]  You see, Omar's not on the take.
[03:45:16.707 --> 03:45:21.989]  Omar's not running for Congress so he can line his own pockets.
[03:45:21.989 --> 03:45:28.231]  Omar Navarro's not running because he likes the social status and the money-making opportunities.
[03:45:29.275 --> 03:45:43.025]  Omar Navarro is running for Congress to serve the people, and he will pursue policies much in line with the President that could bring opportunity and growth back to this district.
[03:45:43.025 --> 03:45:49.109]  There is one more important issue, and it's really a problem for Maxine Waters.
[03:45:49.109 --> 03:45:54.413]  Yes, the James Brown Foundation, well, they want their wig back.
[03:45:56.069 --> 03:46:00.772]  Thank you for joining me, Roger Stone, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:46:00.772 --> 03:46:12.118]  I do want to mention again that we have, right now in the last weeks of July, some incredible sales going on at the Infowars.com store.
[03:46:12.118 --> 03:46:22.184]  Now, there is a super silver special, which is a silver bullet plus super blue powder toothpaste, 50% off retail.
[03:46:25.826 --> 03:46:30.589]  This is a combination that my wife, Nydia, really loves.
[03:46:30.589 --> 03:46:34.312]  She has an extraordinarily gleaming smile.
[03:46:34.312 --> 03:46:48.161]  I can tell you she's tried all the, you know, drugstore-based, off-the-shelf products, and nothing has given her the whiteness and the natural look that she is justly proud of.
[03:46:48.161 --> 03:46:53.144]  So you can get the Super Silver Special at $34.93, which is silver bullet,
[03:46:55.906 --> 03:47:04.793]  Plus the Super Blue Power Toothpaste and Toothbrush at 50% off of retail.
[03:47:04.793 --> 03:47:07.555]  This is really a terrific deal.
[03:47:07.555 --> 03:47:08.435]  I recommend it.
[03:47:08.435 --> 03:47:10.737]  But let's look at some of the other things.
[03:47:10.737 --> 03:47:13.459]  ProPure Traveler, $132, 30% off of retail.
[03:47:13.459 --> 03:47:16.501]  Alexa Pure Breeze, 25% off of retail at $149.96.
[03:47:23.590 --> 03:47:26.652]  Knockout, this stuff is great.
[03:47:26.652 --> 03:47:29.954]  $14.95, 50% off of retail.
[03:47:29.954 --> 03:47:37.618]  Prostagard, this is an all-natural formula that protects your natural plumbing if you are a man.
[03:47:37.618 --> 03:47:46.123]  Saw Palmetto, yes, but zinc and other absolutely necessary natural ingredients for optimum performance.
[03:47:47.343 --> 03:48:04.056]  Then you have the conservatism is the new counterculture coffee mug, which I believe was developed by my friend Paul Joseph Watson, and DNA Force, $119.95, 20% off of retail.
[03:48:04.056 --> 03:48:11.582]  This is one of the products that I attribute to saving my life back in December when I believe I was poisoned.
[03:48:12.462 --> 03:48:16.365]  And it was a long crawl back, folks.
[03:48:16.365 --> 03:48:18.927]  I think I've never been so sick in my life.
[03:48:18.927 --> 03:48:31.617]  Sure, I went to the doctor, but I also loaded up on a number of the all-natural products at the Infowars.com store to try to boost my immunity and get back on track, and of course,
[03:48:32.418 --> 03:48:46.417]  I was able to complete my book, The Making of the President 2016, how Donald Trump orchestrated a revolution, and you can get that also at the InfoWars.com store.
[03:48:46.417 --> 03:48:48.079]  So, it's a two-way street.
[03:48:48.960 --> 03:48:52.982]  We will continue to fight here for liberty and the truth.
[03:48:52.982 --> 03:48:59.846]  We will bring you the breaking news on Deborah Wasserman Schultz, on the Seth Rich murder.
[03:48:59.846 --> 03:49:07.570]  We will highlight the egregious violations of civil liberties by the Obama NSA gang.
[03:49:07.570 --> 03:49:14.834]  The wiretapping, the surveillance, the reading of emails, text messages, the monitoring of phone calls.
[03:49:15.914 --> 03:49:20.579]  But believe me, those in the deep state would like to shut us up.
[03:49:20.579 --> 03:49:23.582]  They would like to close us down.
[03:49:23.582 --> 03:49:29.168]  They know we don't have any billionaire fat cats in the background writing big checks.
[03:49:29.168 --> 03:49:32.471]  We can only rely on you.
[03:49:32.471 --> 03:49:37.596]  So, please, InfoWarriors, do yourself a favor, but help the mothership.
[03:49:38.317 --> 03:49:50.279]  Go to the store now, take advantage of these unbelievable July opportunities where you have really deep discounts on products that literally have thousands of testimonials.
[03:49:51.345 --> 03:49:58.189]  We would never put anything online, folks, that we didn't think was the very best of its genre.
[03:49:58.189 --> 03:50:02.651]  Alex Jones demands a testing regimen like nothing I have ever seen.
[03:50:02.651 --> 03:50:07.574]  Nothing second-rate will ever show up on the Infowars.com store.
[03:50:07.574 --> 03:50:08.654]  Help us.
[03:50:08.654 --> 03:50:09.855]  Help yourself.
[03:50:09.855 --> 03:50:11.216]  Help the revolution.
[03:50:11.216 --> 03:50:12.617]  Help the president.
[03:50:12.617 --> 03:50:15.178]  And help make America great again.
[03:50:15.178 --> 03:50:15.978]  Go to the store.
[03:50:17.299 --> 03:50:19.982]  And support us with your dollars.
[03:50:19.982 --> 03:50:22.705]  You'll be glad you did.
[03:50:22.705 --> 03:50:25.367]  We're going to come back here in just a moment.
[03:50:25.367 --> 03:50:27.449]  There's still a lot of news to cover.
[03:50:27.449 --> 03:50:30.552]  News you won't hear on the mainstream media.
[03:50:30.552 --> 03:50:38.059]  I got words moments ago that my appearance on the Don Lemon Show tonight on CNN has been cancelled.
[03:50:39.140 --> 03:50:45.425]  I didn't bother to shave because, frankly, I knew they would cancel at the time it was booked.
[03:50:45.425 --> 03:50:50.408]  Seems like the folks at CNN can't handle the truth.
[03:50:50.408 --> 03:50:57.853]  If you want the truth, you've got to come here to InfoWars.com with Alex Jones and the crew.
[03:50:57.853 --> 03:50:58.774]  Many thanks.
[03:50:58.774 --> 03:50:59.214]  I'll be back.

[03:54:06.755 --> 03:54:08.897]  Welcome back.
[03:54:28.678 --> 03:54:36.082]  I'm Roger Stone, here at InfoWars, sitting in for my good friend Alex Jones.
[03:54:36.082 --> 03:54:38.023]  I want to start a new thing here.
[03:54:38.023 --> 03:54:40.944]  We're going to call it Bad Guy of the Week.
[03:54:40.944 --> 03:54:49.709]  And we're going to try, in each segment, to identify an individual currently in government who needs to go.
[03:54:49.709 --> 03:54:54.532]  In this case, I have in mind Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.
[03:54:55.632 --> 03:55:14.004]  Currently serving as the acting director of the FBI, or I guess now that Mr. Wray has been confirmed only yesterday, serving as the number two man at the FBI, this fellow has a number of actions of malfeasance and conflicts of interest that are most troubling.
[03:55:14.804 --> 03:55:36.066]  First of all, it is Mr. McCabe who authorized the spending of $50,000 of our tax money to pay for the phony dossier that was created in Europe and brought to our FBI for the purposes of smearing the President
[03:55:36.967 --> 03:55:55.169]  Uh, based on completely false allegations, uh, that he, uh, engaged a group of prostitutes to urinate on a bed in a Moscow hotel room, uh, for some period or, uh, I guess sexual reason.
[03:55:56.320 --> 03:56:01.542]  This whole story is a lie, a manufactured fairy tale.
[03:56:01.542 --> 03:56:17.248]  We now know that the Fusion GPS was involved, but what convinced Mr. McCabe that we would want to spend $50,000 of our tax dollars trying to forward this phony dossier?
[03:56:18.288 --> 03:56:45.710]  He also didn't bother to report that his wife, who was running for the State Senate, got a $675,000 infusion of cash from Terry McAuliffe, the Democrat governor of Virginia, the finance chairman for both Bill and Hillary's previous presidential campaigns, and a fellow who knows how to move money around.
[03:56:46.551 --> 03:56:52.876]  This, uh, at the exact time that McCabe was supposed to be investigating Hillary Clinton.
[03:56:52.876 --> 03:56:55.038]  Sure smells like a payoff to me.
[03:56:56.328 --> 03:57:10.321]  And now, of course, McCabe is deeply involved, using the full force and might of the FBI as the thugs who are running the wide-scale witch hunt against the Trump family.
[03:57:10.321 --> 03:57:19.330]  Laura High Executioner Mueller, who we now know was appointed at the behest of White House Chief of Staff
[03:57:21.272 --> 03:57:34.601]  Reince Priebus, through the auspices of the number two man at the Justice Department, Rod Rosenstein, all at the behest of Democrat Congressman, yes, Elijah Cummings.
[03:57:34.601 --> 03:57:39.004]  The President needs to clean this rat's nest out.
[03:57:39.004 --> 03:57:44.828]  And I think Mr. McCabe should be among the first to go.
[03:57:44.828 --> 03:57:47.730]  So he is our bad guy for the week.
[03:57:49.003 --> 03:58:01.127]  While you're at it, folks, before we're done here, please go back to the InfoWars.com website and pick up... I'm thinking now of the amazing t-shirts.
[03:58:01.127 --> 03:58:08.989]  I love the Trump-Pence 2020 t-shirt, the Hillary Clinton for President 2017 t-shirts.
[03:58:08.989 --> 03:58:12.410]  There were a lot of those at the Omar Navarro event the other night.
[03:58:13.090 --> 03:58:16.332]  This is the First Amendment in action, folks.
[03:58:16.332 --> 03:58:26.977]  So not only do we have these unbelievable sales, but you can get right into political activism and meet others who are info warriors like you.
[03:58:26.977 --> 03:58:28.898]  This is how we identify each other.
[03:58:28.898 --> 03:58:32.960]  There's no secret handshake, folks, but the t-shirts give it away.
[03:58:32.960 --> 03:58:38.523]  We need your support, and here's a fun, easy, and First Amendment-based way to do it.
[03:58:39.309 --> 03:58:41.612]  Roger Stone for InfoWars.
[03:58:41.612 --> 03:58:42.793]  Glad to be with you.
[03:58:42.793 --> 03:58:44.035]  Victory or death.
