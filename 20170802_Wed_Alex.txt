[00:01.000 --> 00:04.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[00:10.000 --> 00:12.000]  Waging war on corruption
[00:12.000 --> 00:18.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War
[00:25.000 --> 00:27.000]  Ladies and gentlemen
[00:27.000 --> 00:30.000]  Psyhurst two-time Pulitzer Prize winner
[00:30.000 --> 00:34.000]  A man credited more than anybody of ending the Vietnam War
[00:34.000 --> 00:38.000]  Even more so than Walter Cronkite or Mr. Ellsberg
[00:38.000 --> 00:42.000]  Psyhurst two-time Pulitzer Prize winner
[00:42.000 --> 00:47.000]  Has come out in a shock bombshell interview
[00:47.000 --> 00:48.000]  That's on infowars.com
[00:48.000 --> 00:50.000]  There's a total blackout on this news
[00:50.000 --> 00:54.000]  And said he talked directly to intelligence sources
[00:54.000 --> 00:56.000]  We know one of them was the British ambassador
[00:56.000 --> 01:00.000]  As well as folks at the highest levels of US intel
[01:00.000 --> 01:03.000]  That Seth Rich was the leaker
[01:03.000 --> 01:05.000]  It was not a Russian hack
[01:05.000 --> 01:09.000]  That Psyhurst, there's a total blackout on this news
[01:09.000 --> 01:12.000]  We're going to break it in the next segment
[01:12.000 --> 01:13.000]  This is huge
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.000]  Meanwhile, Google, YouTube and others have launched a massive censorship
[01:17.000 --> 01:19.000]  That started two days ago
[01:19.000 --> 01:25.000]  Google and YouTube have banned a professor who refused to use gender neutral pronouns in Canada
[01:25.000 --> 01:26.000]  It's happening
[01:26.000 --> 01:49.000]  Here's Paul Watson reporting
[01:56.000 --> 01:58.000]  This is a serious organization
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.000]  The ADL's bar for hate speech must be pretty high, right?
[02:02.000 --> 02:06.000]  Advocating for genocide, calling for violence against Jews?
[02:06.000 --> 02:09.000]  Oh, they literally think a cartoon frog is hate speech
[02:09.000 --> 02:11.000]  That's how low the bar is
[02:11.000 --> 02:16.000]  The ADL put the grandson of a survivor of the Nazi occupation on a list
[02:16.000 --> 02:19.000]  Alongside actual neo-Nazis and white supremacists
[02:19.000 --> 02:22.000]  Simply because he's a conservative
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  He also listed a bunch of other conservatives next to actual neo-Nazis
[02:26.000 --> 02:30.000]  Oh, but they're the impartial, rational, neutral outfit
[02:30.000 --> 02:33.000]  That's now going to thought police YouTube
[02:33.000 --> 02:35.000]  They're not partisan at all
[02:35.000 --> 02:40.000]  So a group whose entire existence and millions of dollars in funding every year
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.000]  Relies on fanning hysteria over hate speech
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.000]  Is now being given the power by YouTube to patrol hate speech
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.000]  Gee, what could possibly go wrong?
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.000]  Working with YouTube to patrol hate speech
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  The Institute for Strategic Dialogue
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.000]  A group that runs a program on far-right extremism
[02:57.000 --> 03:00.000]  In coordination with the Swedish government
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.000]  Oh, you mean the same Swedish government
[03:02.000 --> 03:06.000]  That put 14,000 people, most of them conservative commentators
[03:06.000 --> 03:09.000]  On a Twitter hate speech block list
[03:09.000 --> 03:11.000]  The same Swedish government that put PewDiePie
[03:11.000 --> 03:15.000]  A dude whose content consists mostly of him playing video games
[03:15.000 --> 03:17.000]  On that same hate speech block list
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.000]  A government that thinks posting factual statistics
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  About the link between migrants and violent crime
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  Is an act of hate speech
[03:25.000 --> 03:27.000]  What could possibly go wrong?
[03:27.000 --> 03:31.000]  Who else gets to decide what is and isn't hate speech on YouTube?
[03:31.000 --> 03:33.000]  The No Hate Speech Movement
[03:33.000 --> 03:37.000]  A group that says websites that criticize Islam or hate speech
[03:37.000 --> 03:40.000]  A group that says the President of the United States
[03:40.000 --> 03:43.000]  Should be banned from Twitter for hate speech
[03:43.000 --> 03:46.000]  That bar still seems pretty low, doesn't it?
[03:46.000 --> 03:50.000]  I guess YouTube are just following the example of Twitter and Facebook
[03:50.000 --> 03:53.000]  When Twitter wanted to crack down on abuse and harassment
[03:53.000 --> 03:56.000]  They teamed up with feminists who think telling them
[03:56.000 --> 03:58.000]  They suck is abuse and harassment
[03:58.000 --> 04:02.000]  Everything is sexist, everything is racist, everything is homophobic
[04:02.000 --> 04:05.000]  When Facebook wanted to crack down on fake news
[04:05.000 --> 04:09.000]  They teamed up with snow-secredible independent outlet
[04:09.000 --> 04:12.000]  That isn't left of Stalin and doesn't embezzle money
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  To spend on luxury vacations and prostitutes
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.000]  But don't worry, because YouTube says they're not going to censor controversial videos
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.000]  They're just going to hide them, make sure they can't appear in the recommended bar
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.000]  Be liked or commented on, but they're not censoring them honest
[04:26.000 --> 04:27.000]  Let's get real
[04:27.000 --> 04:32.000]  In the context of politics, the right has completely taken over YouTube
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  Even vice.com had to admit it
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.000]  The ad-pocalypse was only the beginning
[04:37.000 --> 04:40.000]  Unless we bitch and moan about this over and over again
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  This is the start of the purge
[04:43.000 --> 04:46.000]  If you're not a conservative, you should still be alarmed
[04:46.000 --> 04:50.000]  They're going after anyone who is an advertiser friendly
[04:50.000 --> 04:55.000]  Which is basically anyone outside the limits of the narrow consensus of opinion
[04:55.000 --> 04:57.000]  That they subjectively define
[04:57.000 --> 05:02.000]  Maybe we have allies within the company that can put a stop to this
[05:02.000 --> 05:24.000]  Unless we fight back, this is the beginning of the end
[05:33.000 --> 05:40.000]  There are still very effective low-tech, low-cost things you can do to prepare
[05:40.000 --> 05:43.000]  In fact, even realizing that there's a need to prepare
[05:43.000 --> 05:48.000]  And doing anything to act on that realization increases your chances of survival
[05:48.000 --> 05:51.000]  Things that you do to prepare for an Armageddon scenario
[05:51.000 --> 05:54.000]  Will help you to weather storms, to absorb an economic shock
[05:54.000 --> 05:56.000]  Or to protect you from home invasion
[05:56.000 --> 05:58.000]  Prepare for the worst-case scenario
[05:58.000 --> 06:02.000]  While you educate yourself and others, and work for the best-case scenario
[06:02.000 --> 06:05.000]  Get more information at infowars.com

[06:35.000 --> 06:37.000]  I'm David Knight
[07:06.000 --> 07:10.000]  A new shipment of bio-trust selenium is now available at infowarslife.com
[07:10.000 --> 07:12.000]  We've been sold out for months
[07:12.000 --> 07:17.000]  Our one-of-a-kind infowars life bio-trust selenium formula is now back in stock at infowarslife.com
[07:17.000 --> 07:21.000]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the pharmaceutical industry to its core
[07:21.000 --> 07:26.000]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium
[07:26.000 --> 07:31.000]  But bio-trust selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed
[07:31.000 --> 07:34.000]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known
[07:34.000 --> 07:38.000]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight
[07:38.000 --> 07:43.000]  Bio-trust selenium is also the perfect supercharger to survive the shield X2 nascent iodine
[07:43.000 --> 07:46.000]  As both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems
[07:46.000 --> 07:51.000]  Visit infowarslife.com to order your bottle of bio-trust selenium before we sell it again
[07:51.000 --> 07:56.000]  That's infowarslife.com to secure your selenium and other key products that don't only help yourself and your family
[07:56.000 --> 08:00.000]  But also fund our operation against the globalist A360Wand
[08:00.000 --> 08:02.000]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight
[08:02.000 --> 08:05.000]  This is the time to support InfoWars. That's infowarslife.com
[08:33.000 --> 08:36.000]  If you won't stand up against them, you'll only be a slave
[08:36.000 --> 08:40.000]  If you're sad and lonely, they will push you around and think you're their slave
[08:40.000 --> 08:45.000]  They come again, they come back again, stand up and tell them the New World Order
[08:45.000 --> 08:49.000]  You can take our lives, but you'll never take off freedom
[08:49.000 --> 08:54.000]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong
[08:54.000 --> 08:59.000]  The people above you that are inviting you into their New World Order, they're slaves
[08:59.000 --> 09:03.000]  They've sold out to it, they're blind to their towers
[09:03.000 --> 09:04.000]  You don't want to be part of them
[09:04.000 --> 09:07.000]  Like Patrick Henry said, forget you are our president
[09:07.000 --> 09:11.000]  Go from us to peace, crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you
[09:11.000 --> 09:14.000]  Let your chains sit lightly upon you
[09:14.000 --> 09:19.000]  And for me, give me liberty or give me death
[09:19.000 --> 09:23.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance
[09:26.000 --> 09:30.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance
[09:37.000 --> 09:44.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on the second day of August 2017
[09:44.000 --> 09:47.000]  on this Wednesday worldwide global transmission
[09:47.000 --> 09:50.000]  First off, out of the gates
[09:50.000 --> 09:56.000]  Two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Sy Hirsch, has already written
[09:56.000 --> 10:02.000]  months ago that he talked to U.S. intelligence and a top British ambassador
[10:02.000 --> 10:07.000]  who had actually met with high-level U.S. intelligence officers as well
[10:07.000 --> 10:12.000]  that have confirmed that Seth Rich was the leaker to WikiLeaks
[10:12.000 --> 10:17.000]  We have Julian Assange publicly
[10:17.000 --> 10:21.000]  within a week of Seth Rich being gunned down, shot in the back
[10:21.000 --> 10:24.000]  saying that they don't ever give up sources
[10:24.000 --> 10:27.000]  but that basically Seth Rich was their source
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.000]  and it should be investigated along those lines
[10:31.000 --> 10:34.000]  We now have Intel coming out
[10:34.000 --> 10:37.000]  that you have these Islamic brothers from Pakistan
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.000]  in control of the Democratic Party servers
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.000]  and that Seth Rich was reportedly that night at a party with them
[10:44.000 --> 10:48.000]  You have Debbie Wasserman-Schultz threatening the DC police
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.000]  that she is over as representative of that area
[10:52.000 --> 10:55.000]  saying, I'll cut your funding if you don't get back their laptops
[10:55.000 --> 11:00.000]  and then you have them in the news saying, don't ever question Seth Rich's murder
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  don't look at it or we'll basically have somebody sue you
[11:04.000 --> 11:07.000]  Well, this is Sy Hirsch, ladies and gentlemen
[11:07.000 --> 11:12.000]  The article is on infowars.com
[11:12.000 --> 11:15.000]  The video and audio is on infowars.com
[11:15.000 --> 11:18.000]  and there is a total MSM blackout
[11:18.000 --> 11:22.000]  on two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning author
[11:22.000 --> 11:25.000]  who also exposed that ISIS and Al Qaeda were being run by Obama
[11:25.000 --> 11:30.000]  By the way, he's a liberal, a classical liberal
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  but he has a conscience
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.000]  He's credited with ending the Vietnam War with his stories
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.000]  on the Milai massacre, you name it
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.000]  The guy that spurred Walter Cronkite to say the war was unwinnable
[11:41.000 --> 11:43.000]  because it wasn't meant to be won
[11:43.000 --> 11:46.000]  Media completely ignores bombshell
[11:46.000 --> 11:49.000]  Seymour Hirsch revelations on Seth Rich
[11:49.000 --> 11:53.000]  not a single MSM outlet has covered the story
[11:53.000 --> 11:56.000]  The audio obtained by Big League Politics
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.000]  says he saw an FBI report leaked to him by an insider
[12:01.000 --> 12:04.000]  which confirms that Rich had contacted WikiLeaks
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  sample emails from DNC Leaker
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.000]  and asked for payment for the full data dump
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  and it goes on from there
[12:11.000 --> 12:14.000]  and he has multiple ambassadors telling him the same thing
[12:14.000 --> 12:17.000]  One of these ambassadors has gone public to say
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.000]  he met with US intelligence and they showed him the files
[12:21.000 --> 12:26.000]  that Rich was reportedly out there trying to sell the data
[12:26.000 --> 12:29.000]  Isn't that interesting?
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.000]  Well, they don't want you to hear it
[12:31.000 --> 12:36.000]  We've had to bleep it, but this is the candid recording of Seymour Hirsch
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.000]  Here is that report
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.000]  But WikiLeaks got access before he was killed
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  About the kid, okay, what I know
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  What I know comes off an FBI report
[12:58.000 --> 13:01.000]  how you can figure out if they're all long enough
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.000]  The kid, yes, I don't think he was murdered
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  I don't think he was murdered because of what he knew
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  The kid is a nice boy, 27, he was not an IT expert
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  but he learned stuff, he was a data programmer
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  but he learned stuff
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  and so he's living on one street
[13:15.000 --> 13:18.000]  He's living in a very rough neighborhood
[13:18.000 --> 13:20.000]  and in the exact area where he lived
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  there's been about 10, I'm sure you know this
[13:22.000 --> 13:26.000]  there's been about 8 or 9 or 10 violent robberies
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  and most of them with somebody bandishing a gun
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  and if the kid's hands, I'm telling you
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  but I'm sure you know it, his hands were marked up
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  the cops concluded, he thought off the people
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  tried to run in, he shot them twice in the back
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  with a 22 small caliber
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  and then the kids just didn't ran
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  they got scared, didn't take his wallet, okay
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  so what the cops do then, and here's what nobody knows
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  I'm telling you, maybe you know something about it
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  when you have a death like that, DC cops
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  if you're dead, you generally don't just go
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  you have to find out what's going on
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.000]  you have to get to the kid's apartment
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  you're trying, if you're dead, you don't need a warrant
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  but most cops get a warrant because they don't know
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.000]  if the guy has a roommate, you need a warrant
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  so they get a warrant, I'm just telling you
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  there is such a thing, they go in their house
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  and they can't do much with this computer
[14:09.000 --> 14:11.000]  it's password, the cops don't know much about it
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.000]  so the DC cops, they have a cyber unit in DC
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  and they're more sophisticated, they come and look at it
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.000]  the idea is maybe he's had a series of exchanges
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  with somebody who says, I'm gonna kill you
[14:21.000 --> 14:24.000]  f*** over a girl, and they can't get in
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  the cyber guys do a little better
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  but they can't make sense of it
[14:28.000 --> 14:31.000]  so they call the FBI's cyber unit
[14:31.000 --> 14:34.000]  the DC unit, the Washington field office
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  is a hot s*** unit
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  the guy running the Washington field office
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.000]  he's like a three star at an army base
[14:41.000 --> 14:43.000]  he's ready to look into a fort
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  he's gonna go into a top job
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.000]  there's a cyber unit there, that's excellent
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  what you get in a warrant
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  the public information you get in a warrant
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  doesn't include
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  it does not include
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  the affidavit underlying
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  why you're going in, what the reasons are
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  that's almost never available on
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  I can tell you that
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  the existence of a warrant is a public document
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  99% of the time
[15:11.000 --> 15:14.000]  so they, on the same warrant
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  they call in the feds, the feds get through
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  and here's what they find
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  this is according to the FBI report
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  what they find is
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  he makes, first of all
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  you have to know, you have to know
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  some basic facts, one of the basic facts
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.000]  there's no DNC or protested email
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  that exists beyond May 22nd
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  May 21st, 22nd, the last email
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  for either one of those groups
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  and so this, so
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  what the report says
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  that sometime in late spring
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.000]  we're talking about
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  summers in June 21st
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  late spring would be after
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  I presume, I don't know
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  I just said late spring, early summer
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  he makes contact with WikiLeaks
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  that's in his computer
[15:58.000 --> 16:00.000]  and he makes contact
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  now, I have to be careful
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  because I met Julian
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.000]  and you're Julian
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.000]  in 12 years, I say this
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.000]  people like that, you know
[16:10.000 --> 16:12.000]  he said by the name, when I'm in London
[16:12.000 --> 16:14.000]  I always get a message, come see me at the Ecuadorian
[16:14.000 --> 16:16.000]  they said, there's a f*** you, I'm going there
[16:16.000 --> 16:18.000]  I don't like getting photographed
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.000]  these are the total surveillance by everybody
[16:20.000 --> 16:22.000]  but anyway, they found
[16:22.000 --> 16:24.000]  what he had done
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  he had submitted a series of
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  documents of emails
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  from juicy emails from the DNC
[16:30.000 --> 16:32.000]  and you know, by the way
[16:32.000 --> 16:34.000]  all this f*** about the DNC
[16:34.000 --> 16:36.000]  you know
[16:36.000 --> 16:38.000]  where the heck, it wasn't heck
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  but whatever happened
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  the Democrats themselves wrote this f***
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  you know what I mean, all I know is that
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  he offered a sample
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  an extensive sample
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  you know, I'm sure dozens of emails
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  and said, I want money
[16:54.000 --> 16:56.000]  that later, WikiLeaks
[16:56.000 --> 16:58.000]  did get the password, he had a drop box
[16:58.000 --> 17:00.000]  a protective drop box
[17:00.000 --> 17:02.000]  which isn't hard to do
[17:02.000 --> 17:04.000]  I mean, you don't have to be a wizard, I keep
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  you know, he was certainly young, not dumb kid
[17:06.000 --> 17:08.000]  and they got access to the drop box
[17:08.000 --> 17:10.000]  he also, this is also in the FBI
[17:10.000 --> 17:12.000]  report, he also let people know
[17:12.000 --> 17:14.000]  with whom he was dealing
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.000]  I don't know how he dealt with
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  WikiLeaks in a second
[17:18.000 --> 17:20.000]  I don't know how he dealt
[17:20.000 --> 17:22.000]  with WikiLeaks, the mechanism
[17:22.000 --> 17:24.000]  but he also, the word was passed
[17:24.000 --> 17:26.000]  according to the FBI report
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  I also shared this box with a couple of friends
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.000]  so if anything happens to me
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  you're not going to solve your problem
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  okay, I don't know what that means
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  I don't know what he was, anyway
[17:36.000 --> 17:38.000]  but WikiLeaks got access
[17:38.000 --> 17:40.000]  and before he was killed
[17:40.000 --> 17:42.000]  I can tell you right now, Brennan's
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  I've known all these people for years
[17:44.000 --> 17:46.000]  Craver is sort of a better guy
[17:46.000 --> 17:48.000]  but not rocket scientist, the NSA guys
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  are f***ing moron
[17:50.000 --> 17:52.000]  the trouble with all those guys is
[17:52.000 --> 17:54.000]  the only way they're going to make it
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.000]  to the board or two and get
[17:56.000 --> 17:58.000]  hired by SAIC to deliver some type of contract
[17:58.000 --> 18:00.000]  is this the only way they stay in
[18:00.000 --> 18:02.000]  with Trump, they're gone
[18:02.000 --> 18:04.000]  they're done, they're going to live in their pensions
[18:04.000 --> 18:06.000]  they're not going to make it
[18:06.000 --> 18:08.000]  they don't want to live in their pensions
[18:08.000 --> 18:10.000]  they want to be on board like they're
[18:10.000 --> 18:12.000]  making $600,000 of going to four businesses
[18:12.000 --> 18:14.000]  I have somebody
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.000]  I have somebody on the inside
[18:16.000 --> 18:18.000]  I've been around a long time and I've read a lot of stuff
[18:18.000 --> 18:20.000]  I have somebody inside who will go
[18:20.000 --> 18:22.000]  and read a file for me
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  this person is unbelievably accurate
[18:24.000 --> 18:26.000]  and carefully, he's a very high level guy
[18:26.000 --> 18:28.000]  you'll do a favor, you're just going to have to
[18:28.000 --> 18:30.000]  trust me
[18:30.000 --> 18:32.000]  I have
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.000]  what they call in my business, one form journalism
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.000]  I have a narrative of how that
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  thing began
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.000]  it's a Brennan operation, it was an American disinformation
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.000]  and
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  the president
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  at one point when they even started telling the press
[18:46.000 --> 18:48.000]  they were back briefing the press, the head of the NSA
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  was going and telling the press
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  f***ing f***ing Rogers
[18:52.000 --> 18:54.000]  was telling the press
[18:54.000 --> 18:56.000]  that we even know who was the GR
[18:56.000 --> 18:58.000]  the Russian military intelligence service
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  they were telling
[19:00.000 --> 19:02.000]  I worked at the New York Times for f***ing years
[19:02.000 --> 19:04.000]  I'm sure it was a f***ing New York Times
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.000]  they're smart guys but they're totally
[19:06.000 --> 19:08.000]  beholden on sources
[19:08.000 --> 19:10.000]  if the president
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.000]  or the head of the CHL
[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  they actually believe
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.000]  they haven't heard of the Times to go after the war
[19:16.000 --> 19:18.000]  in the Vietnam War in 72
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  because they were just locked in
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.000]  so that's what the Times is
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  these guys run the f***ing Times
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  and Trump's not wrong
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  I wish he would calm down
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  they had a better press secretary
[19:30.000 --> 19:32.000]  they don't let the people
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  there's Sy Hirsch
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  the greatest living journalist
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  and he likes Trump
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  just like the polls like Trump
[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  any real intellectual
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  like Julian Assange likes Trump
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  anybody who's smart, anybody who has the facts
[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  cannot believe how good he is
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  he's so real though
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  he's wild
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  it's true
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  he is the president of the United States
[19:56.000 --> 19:58.000]  and he is on the deck and he is in charge
[19:58.000 --> 20:00.000]  and the elite are scared
[20:00.000 --> 20:02.000]  because they don't know what he's going to do to them
[20:02.000 --> 20:04.000]  because they're such criminals
[20:04.000 --> 20:32.000]  in fact, that was bombshell info
[20:34.000 --> 20:36.000]  www.CAMPS.com
[21:04.000 --> 21:07.000]  a great president once said

[24:31.000 --> 24:39.000]  take about the magnitude of this information
[24:39.000 --> 24:43.000]  Seymour Hirsch, two-time Pulitzer Prize winner
[24:43.000 --> 24:46.000]  the most famous living American journalist
[24:46.000 --> 24:49.000]  he's the most famous journalist last hundred years
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.000]  totally documented
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.000]  coming out in a new report saying he talked to high level
[24:54.000 --> 24:57.000]  US government officials, ambassadors, you name it
[24:57.000 --> 24:59.000]  they were watching Seth Rich
[24:59.000 --> 25:02.000]  they were trying to get into the DNC systems
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  the DNC hadn't let them in
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  they knew it was being penetrated
[25:06.000 --> 25:09.000]  they were watching Seth Rich trying to sell the data
[25:09.000 --> 25:12.000]  to WikiLeaks and you have WikiLeaks saying
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  right after he got shot in the back
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  that yes he was their source
[25:16.000 --> 25:20.000]  now we have Psy Hirsch confirming all of it
[25:20.000 --> 25:24.000]  we have the identity of the DNC leaker
[25:24.000 --> 25:28.000]  and it's not a Russian ladies and gentlemen
[25:28.000 --> 25:33.000]  here is Julian Assange from right after it happened
[25:33.000 --> 25:36.000]  saying I investigated both presidential candidates
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  and only Clinton has ties to Russia
[25:38.000 --> 25:41.000]  and then you actually look at who did the uranium deal
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.000]  who got the hundred million for the bank deal
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  who met with Putin in secret
[25:45.000 --> 25:50.000]  who had Mueller take illegal uranium samples
[25:50.000 --> 25:54.000]  to a tarmac to meet with the Russians in Europe
[25:54.000 --> 25:57.000]  for the Clintons
[25:57.000 --> 26:01.000]  who can make this up
[26:01.000 --> 26:04.000]  Hillary used the State Department as a whole parallel government
[26:04.000 --> 26:07.000]  sometimes even against Obama's policies
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  and other globalist policies running her own system
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  she was co-president for eight years with Bill
[26:12.000 --> 26:15.000]  she was co-president for eight years with Obama
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  and that's why the deep state is so arrogant
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  you've got all these different factions
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  doing whatever they want
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  and nobody looking out for the American people
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  and here comes Trump
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  saying we're going to have bids again
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  we're going to actually cut taxes
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  we're actually going to secure the border
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  we're actually going to do the right thing for this country
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  we're actually going to get the stock market boosted
[26:35.000 --> 26:37.000]  we're actually going to bring back a thousand plus companies
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.000]  that are already here
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.000]  and the Federal Reserve, private, independent from government
[26:42.000 --> 26:43.000]  its own fourth branch
[26:43.000 --> 26:46.000]  that's the former head of the Federal Reserve's own words
[26:46.000 --> 26:49.000]  Congress and the president can do nothing they claim
[26:49.000 --> 26:52.000]  well Congress actually repealed the Federal Reserve Act of 1913
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  and we're close to doing it so we can do something
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  but they said they're above the law
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  and have raised interest rates four times
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.000]  they say to stop the Trump recovery
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  and they cheer
[27:03.000 --> 27:04.000]  Yay!
[27:04.000 --> 27:07.000]  the Rasmussen polls down to 38
[27:07.000 --> 27:09.000]  Gallup's down to 34
[27:09.000 --> 27:13.000]  well that's because Gallup isn't as fake as Rasmussen
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.000]  just like all those clips
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.000]  and all those news articles during the campaign
[27:18.000 --> 27:21.000]  when Trump was 15, 20 points behind then he won
[27:21.000 --> 27:22.000]  it's called fake polls
[27:22.000 --> 27:25.000]  that's coming up in the next segment but here's Cy Hirsch
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  here is Julian Assange
[27:27.000 --> 27:31.000]  Hillary Clinton has done quite well strategically
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.000]  to try and draw connection between Trump and Russia
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.000]  because she has so many connections of her own
[27:39.000 --> 27:43.000]  now my analysis of Trump and Russia
[27:43.000 --> 27:46.000]  is that there is no substantial connection
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.000]  why do I say that?
[27:48.000 --> 27:51.000]  well because Trump was trying to invest in Russia
[27:51.000 --> 27:53.000]  before Putin in the 1990s
[27:53.000 --> 27:54.000]  after Putin
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.000]  in fact nearly all the way up to the present moment
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.000]  and he's had no success
[28:00.000 --> 28:03.000]  he did not manage to build hotels and so on in Russia
[28:03.000 --> 28:10.000]  so that shows how insubstantial his contacts are
[28:10.000 --> 28:13.000]  there's an extremely well documented pattern
[28:13.000 --> 28:16.000]  of when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State
[28:16.000 --> 28:19.000]  those people, companies, governments
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  who wanted a decision by the Secretary of State
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  in their favor
[28:23.000 --> 28:26.000]  making large donations to the Clinton Foundation
[28:26.000 --> 28:28.000]  or in some other cases
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.000]  business deals with the people around Hillary Clinton
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  now one particular instance
[28:33.000 --> 28:38.000]  is the approval by Secretary Clinton
[28:38.000 --> 28:45.000]  of selling 20% of the US uranium reprocessing rights
[28:45.000 --> 28:49.000]  to a Russian company to be exported to Russia
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  so at that time
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.000]  a large donation was made by those Russian interests
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  to the Clinton Foundation
[28:56.000 --> 29:00.000]  in addition, Clinton's campaign manager, Podesta
[29:00.000 --> 29:03.000]  was on the board of a company called Jewel Unlimited
[29:03.000 --> 29:06.000]  and Jewel Unlimited held some of these rights
[29:06.000 --> 29:13.000]  and received a $35 million investment from Russia
[29:13.000 --> 29:15.000]  and there's a bunch of others as well
[29:15.000 --> 29:19.000]  that's old news but there's a science telling the truth
[29:19.000 --> 29:25.000]  meanwhile, Trump has been bullied into signing the legislation
[29:25.000 --> 29:27.000]  for more sanctions against Russia today
[29:27.000 --> 29:31.000]  and he's being basically bullied into troop increases
[29:31.000 --> 29:34.000]  you name it so he can prove he's not a Russian agent
[29:34.000 --> 29:37.000]  he's not supposed to talk to Putin at dinner
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.000]  or he's a Russian agent
[29:39.000 --> 29:42.000]  it's one of the only areas that Trump has been manipulated
[29:42.000 --> 29:44.000]  into a corner and notice it's only made them say
[29:44.000 --> 29:46.000]  he's more of a Russian agent
[29:46.000 --> 29:48.000]  he could nuke Russia
[29:48.000 --> 29:51.000]  he could slice baby Russians' necks and drink their blood
[29:51.000 --> 29:54.000]  that wouldn't be enough for John McCain, the walking brain tumor
[29:54.000 --> 30:14.000]  we'll be back, stay with us
[30:25.000 --> 30:27.000]  unfortunately we didn't heed his advice
[30:27.000 --> 30:29.000]  we now live in a neo feudalistic society
[30:29.000 --> 30:31.000]  which were treated as indentured servants
[30:31.000 --> 30:33.000]  who only exist to serve the needs of the establishment
[30:33.000 --> 30:36.000]  political office no longer represents the voice of the people
[30:36.000 --> 30:39.000]  but rather the initiation process politicians go through
[30:39.000 --> 30:41.000]  to gain acceptance into the aristocracy
[30:41.000 --> 30:44.000]  simply put, we the people are responsible for civilization and culture
[30:44.000 --> 30:46.000]  yet we're suppressed by a tiny elite who have organized
[30:46.000 --> 30:49.000]  into criminal gangs that operate governments around the world
[30:49.000 --> 30:52.000]  we falsely believe that everything is simply black and white
[30:52.000 --> 30:54.000]  the other, conservative versus liberal
[30:54.000 --> 30:56.000]  but things will change once more of us realize this truth
[30:56.000 --> 30:58.000]  as Thomas Jefferson also said
[30:58.000 --> 31:00.000]  enlighten the people generally
[31:00.000 --> 31:02.000]  and tyranny and oppressions of the body and mind
[31:02.000 --> 31:04.000]  will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day
[31:04.000 --> 31:24.000]  this is Kit Daniels with infowars.com
[31:35.000 --> 31:36.000]  that's what I'm talking about
[31:36.000 --> 31:39.000]  and when compared to traditional methods of preservation
[31:39.000 --> 31:41.000]  like canning or dehydrating
[31:41.000 --> 31:43.000]  you know like what you get at the grocery store
[31:43.000 --> 31:45.000]  there is no comparison
[31:55.000 --> 31:58.000]  now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation
[31:58.000 --> 32:00.000]  harvest right is truly the world's best
[32:00.000 --> 32:02.000]  most affordable freeze dryer

[33:39.000 --> 33:42.000]  it's the Alex Jones show
[33:52.000 --> 33:54.000]  yes ladies and gentlemen this is what would have happened
[33:54.000 --> 33:56.000]  if Hillary would have been Madame President
[33:58.000 --> 34:01.000]  you know I ended up taking it home with me last night
[34:01.000 --> 34:03.000]  I hadn't actually read the Madame President
[34:03.000 --> 34:06.000]  Newsweek from eight months ago
[34:06.000 --> 34:09.000]  we'd shown the cover and shown the news articles
[34:09.000 --> 34:11.000]  that they had for the election
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  that they actually even had some on store shelves
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  that she was the president
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  talked about fake news from Newsweek
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.000]  but I actually read it last night
[34:19.000 --> 34:23.000]  and it is the richest comedy you've ever heard
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.000]  it's how she beat him
[34:25.000 --> 34:27.000]  what state she beat him in
[34:27.000 --> 34:29.000]  I mean it shows how scripted
[34:29.000 --> 34:31.000]  the attempt to steal the election was
[34:31.000 --> 34:34.000]  down to the six states she tried to steal
[34:34.000 --> 34:37.000]  but the state officials caught
[34:37.000 --> 34:39.000]  Homeland Security breaking into
[34:39.000 --> 34:42.000]  this thing is a roadmap to their fraud
[34:42.000 --> 34:45.000]  it is amazing
[34:45.000 --> 34:49.000]  so I'm gonna shoot a special report on that little juicy
[34:49.000 --> 34:51.000]  in the next few days because
[34:51.000 --> 34:53.000]  it's a doozy
[34:53.000 --> 34:57.000]  60 something pages of pure unadulterated
[34:57.000 --> 35:01.000]  fake news corporate fraud from Newsweek
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.000]  you know the same folks that say the case for rioting
[35:03.000 --> 35:05.000]  and cops deserve to die
[35:05.000 --> 35:07.000]  when they get shot in the back of the head
[35:07.000 --> 35:09.000]  pumping gas or pulling somebody over
[35:09.000 --> 35:12.000]  changing attire and that I want violence
[35:12.000 --> 35:15.000]  and have told my listeners go out and quote
[35:15.000 --> 35:18.000]  kill more liberals
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.000]  was the quote last week
[35:21.000 --> 35:23.000]  but they don't show where I said it
[35:23.000 --> 35:25.000]  they just have a fake quote that I said
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.000]  go out and kill more liberals no
[35:27.000 --> 35:30.000]  I didn't say that you said that Newsweek
[35:30.000 --> 35:33.000]  what a pack of criminal scum
[35:33.000 --> 35:36.000]  snot-nosed anti-American people
[35:36.000 --> 35:39.000]  that have had their foot on our neck forever
[35:39.000 --> 35:41.000]  and now the sleeping giant is awake
[35:41.000 --> 35:44.000]  and they don't know what to do
[35:44.000 --> 35:47.000]  so they got caught lying so they just intensify
[35:47.000 --> 35:51.000]  the make believe with a big cover story
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  that was a cover story on their website
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.000]  for two days
[35:55.000 --> 36:00.000]  that Alex Jones is trying to get a violent war going
[36:00.000 --> 36:03.000]  no we're kicking your traitorous anti-American
[36:03.000 --> 36:06.000]  globalist scum
[36:06.000 --> 36:09.000]  intellectually up the block and back down
[36:09.000 --> 36:13.000]  we are stomping your little piggy faces
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  into the ground
[36:15.000 --> 36:18.000]  so good luck
[36:18.000 --> 36:23.000]  good luck
[36:23.000 --> 36:26.000]  I mean this is ridiculous
[36:26.000 --> 36:29.000]  oh Newsweek tell me about Madam President again
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  and what state she won and how she won
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.000]  and how Trump was so evil
[36:34.000 --> 36:37.000]  now that Hillary's won we've got to mop up
[36:37.000 --> 36:40.000]  the dangerous right wing groups and ban their speech
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.000]  oh yes we know about your whole plan
[36:44.000 --> 36:47.000]  but it didn't go according to schedule
[36:47.000 --> 36:49.000]  now here's the problem
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  they're manipulating the public with fake polls again
[36:51.000 --> 36:54.000]  we're going to cover that the latest on Obamacare
[36:54.000 --> 36:57.000]  we've got a senator another neocon
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  Jeff Flake
[36:59.000 --> 37:03.000]  the last name certainly fits the way he's acting
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  saying he's proud to be a globalist
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  that means transferring your sovereignty
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  to an international group
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  we're going to look at that
[37:11.000 --> 37:13.000]  Senate Republicans slowly turning their backs
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.000]  on Trump
[37:15.000 --> 37:17.000]  AP News they're not slowly turning their backs
[37:17.000 --> 37:20.000]  they always have been trying to slit his throat
[37:20.000 --> 37:23.000]  but politically they have to act like they're with him
[37:23.000 --> 37:26.000]  or they'll be removed from office
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  when Flake's running for office he's a big nationalist
[37:28.000 --> 37:31.000]  and a patriot but when he gets in
[37:31.000 --> 37:34.000]  he's another establishment wannabe that gets off
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  on being traitorous
[37:36.000 --> 37:41.000]  he has that same weird narcissist bug-eyed
[37:41.000 --> 37:44.000]  barracuda smile that all these people with their
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  fake teeth and the rest of it have
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.000]  what a joke
[37:50.000 --> 37:52.000]  meanwhile back in the real world
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  media completely ignores bombshell
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  Seymour Hersh revelations on Seth Rich
[37:56.000 --> 38:00.000]  that's a powerful headline on infowars.com
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  but not powerful enough
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.000]  it's Pulitzer Prize winning journalist reveals
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.000]  the identity of the DNC leaker
[38:10.000 --> 38:13.000]  and the only thing I disagree with
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  Hersh is they're saying well
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  there was a high crime area in DC
[38:17.000 --> 38:18.000]  maybe he really got mugged
[38:18.000 --> 38:19.000]  maybe he really got shot
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  that's the oldest way to kill somebody
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  and make it look like it wasn't a hit
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  was to claim it was a botched robbery
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  and everybody knows that one of the favorite
[38:27.000 --> 38:31.000]  assassin tools is a.22 long rifle
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  doesn't make a big noise
[38:33.000 --> 38:36.000]  somebody's head and pull the trigger
[38:36.000 --> 38:38.000]  it's basically like a silenced weapon
[38:38.000 --> 38:40.000]  most of these things are silencer
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  they really call them suppressors
[38:42.000 --> 38:46.000]  but that is a classic tool of assassination
[38:46.000 --> 38:50.000]  for over a hundred years by La Cosa Nostra
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.000]  by Army Intelligence and then by the CIA
[38:53.000 --> 38:58.000]  is a.22 handgun
[38:58.000 --> 38:59.000]  and that's a fact
[38:59.000 --> 39:02.000]  a lot of folks like the Ruger's as well
[39:02.000 --> 39:05.000]  because they contain the
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.000]  not just the report out of the barrel
[39:09.000 --> 39:12.000]  but also out of the cartridge
[39:12.000 --> 39:15.000]  where it actually detonates
[39:15.000 --> 39:17.000]  farther back in the gun
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  the cap detonating the powder
[39:19.000 --> 39:20.000]  and firing the projectile
[39:20.000 --> 39:21.000]  so I'm just telling you
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  it's a well-known assassination tool
[39:23.000 --> 39:24.000]  is a.22
[39:24.000 --> 39:28.000]  very very quiet
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  I mean
[39:30.000 --> 39:33.000]  Ruger.22s are used in a lot of assassinations
[39:33.000 --> 39:34.000]  now if you're inside a house
[39:34.000 --> 39:35.000]  you don't care
[39:35.000 --> 39:36.000]  it's a shotgun
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  because you don't get rifling off that
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  you just shoot somebody in the face
[39:40.000 --> 39:41.000]  with double-ought buckshot
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  go ahead and shoot them in the chest
[39:43.000 --> 39:44.000]  for a good measure
[39:44.000 --> 39:45.000]  or you can
[39:45.000 --> 39:46.000]  in the case of Gary Webb
[39:46.000 --> 39:49.000]  just shoot him twice with a shotgun
[39:49.000 --> 39:50.000]  but see he fought them
[39:50.000 --> 39:51.000]  so they shot him in the side
[39:51.000 --> 39:52.000]  and in the head
[39:52.000 --> 39:55.000]  but I'm digressing
[39:55.000 --> 39:58.000]  let me just continue on with the news here
[39:58.000 --> 39:59.000]  but regardless
[39:59.000 --> 40:00.000]  he is the DNC leaker
[40:00.000 --> 40:03.000]  and we have that from so many high-level sources
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  and that's why he's dead
[40:05.000 --> 40:07.000]  and it's why they're so scared
[40:07.000 --> 40:08.000]  of media and saying
[40:08.000 --> 40:09.000]  do not investigate
[40:09.000 --> 40:10.000]  do not look at this
[40:10.000 --> 40:11.000]  they're basically saying
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.000]  Seth Rich didn't exist right now
[40:15.000 --> 40:16.000]  they're ridiculing anybody
[40:16.000 --> 40:17.000]  that looks at it
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  because they're so scared
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  now before I plow into all this news
[40:21.000 --> 40:22.000]  that I just mentioned
[40:22.000 --> 40:23.000]  and a lot more
[40:23.000 --> 40:26.000]  we are ending the July specials
[40:26.000 --> 40:28.000]  on August 2nd
[40:28.000 --> 40:29.000]  and I customarily end up
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  going a few days over on sales
[40:31.000 --> 40:34.000]  because I'm kind of chief cook
[40:34.000 --> 40:35.000]  and bottle washer around here
[40:35.000 --> 40:36.000]  I've got to look at what we've got in stock
[40:36.000 --> 40:39.000]  but we can discount what's popular
[40:39.000 --> 40:40.000]  we do have some new specials
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  coming out tomorrow
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  but they won't be as extensive obviously
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  because this has been such a big sale
[40:46.000 --> 40:47.000]  such a deep sale
[40:47.000 --> 40:48.000]  the sale last month
[40:48.000 --> 40:49.000]  has been the biggest ever
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  the longest free shipping
[40:51.000 --> 40:52.000]  you name it
[40:52.000 --> 40:56.000]  the free shipping ends today
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  the 46% on Myco ZX

[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  other part of the probiotic equation
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.000]  that's the biggest discount ever on that
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  DNA 4 is 20% off
[41:06.000 --> 41:07.000]  that's got to end the day
[41:07.000 --> 41:09.000]  this is about to sell out anyways
[41:09.000 --> 41:10.000]  Alexa pure breeze
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  normally $219

[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  it's $149
[41:16.000 --> 41:17.000]  no one can beat that

[41:22.000 --> 41:23.000]  $149
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  you ought to buy a lot of these for your house
[41:25.000 --> 41:26.000]  because it does a big room
[41:26.000 --> 41:27.000]  each one but
[41:27.000 --> 41:30.000]  I've got four of them in my house personally
[41:30.000 --> 41:31.000]  I removed units
[41:31.000 --> 41:32.000]  that cost me $1000
[41:32.000 --> 41:33.000]  three years ago
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  that are the same technology
[41:35.000 --> 41:36.000]  aren't even as good
[41:36.000 --> 41:39.000]  but again that's miniaturization
[41:39.000 --> 41:40.000]  when we first started selling these
[41:40.000 --> 41:41.000]  the competition was $800
[41:41.000 --> 41:42.000]  to $1000
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  now it's down to $400

[41:57.000 --> 41:58.000]  they're good across the board
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  but Pro Pure is excellent

[42:22.000 --> 42:23.000]  this is what
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.000]  is being made fun of by
[42:25.000 --> 42:26.000]  John Oliver
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  when everybody who's done any research knows
[42:28.000 --> 42:29.000]  bone broth for two or three years
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  but the hottest thing out there
[42:31.000 --> 42:32.000]  was always hot with grandma
[42:32.000 --> 42:33.000]  always hot with mom
[42:33.000 --> 42:34.000]  if you were sick
[42:34.000 --> 42:35.000]  she cooked the bones
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  of the chicken into the chicken noodle soup
[42:37.000 --> 42:38.000]  it's known
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  well this is the bones
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  absolutely taken fresh
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  and then pulverized
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  and it's got all the trace minerals
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  all the stuff that's in the marrow
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  and it tastes great
[42:50.000 --> 42:51.000]  I challenge anyone
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  it tastes okay
[42:53.000 --> 42:54.000]  when it's just water
[42:54.000 --> 42:56.000]  but who does stuff like that with water
[42:56.000 --> 42:57.000]  folks mix it with protein
[42:57.000 --> 42:58.000]  with whey
[42:58.000 --> 43:00.000]  they put in milk
[43:00.000 --> 43:01.000]  it's amazing
[43:01.000 --> 43:04.000]  it tastes like
[43:04.000 --> 43:05.000]  ice cream
[43:05.000 --> 43:07.000]  with milk
[43:07.000 --> 43:08.000]  and then they take a clip of me drinking it
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.000]  when I did a demonstration on there
[43:10.000 --> 43:11.000]  so I didn't know
[43:11.000 --> 43:13.000]  that the folks who just put milk in it
[43:13.000 --> 43:14.000]  I'm like
[43:14.000 --> 43:15.000]  mmm that tastes even better
[43:15.000 --> 43:16.000]  in the full clip I say
[43:16.000 --> 43:17.000]  what'd you do
[43:17.000 --> 43:18.000]  and he goes
[43:18.000 --> 43:19.000]  oh a buckly says
[43:19.000 --> 43:20.000]  I added milk
[43:20.000 --> 43:21.000]  oh yeah it tastes
[43:21.000 --> 43:22.000]  it's gone from tasting okay
[43:22.000 --> 43:23.000]  to really great
[43:23.000 --> 43:24.000]  wow
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.000]  and so the fact that I was like savoring it
[43:26.000 --> 43:27.000]  and really going
[43:27.000 --> 43:28.000]  why is this different
[43:28.000 --> 43:29.000]  because I'm honest with folks
[43:29.000 --> 43:30.000]  I'll tell you
[43:30.000 --> 43:32.000]  super mail tastes weird
[43:32.000 --> 43:33.000]  it works though
[43:33.000 --> 43:34.000]  um
[43:34.000 --> 43:36.000]  Child East tastes great
[43:36.000 --> 43:38.000]  a lot of our products
[43:38.000 --> 43:39.000]  taste really great
[43:39.000 --> 43:41.000]  but I mean stuff like super mail
[43:41.000 --> 43:46.000]  the iodine tastes kind of weird
[43:46.000 --> 43:48.000]  oh and then he made fun of me
[43:48.000 --> 43:50.000]  and he said that
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.000]  I said don't go get the random stuff
[43:52.000 --> 43:53.000]  at the store
[43:53.000 --> 43:54.000]  this topical
[43:54.000 --> 43:55.000]  eat a hole in your stomach
[43:55.000 --> 43:56.000]  it can kill you
[43:56.000 --> 43:57.000]  it can
[43:57.000 --> 43:58.000]  you've got to go out
[43:58.000 --> 43:59.000]  and get this
[43:59.000 --> 44:00.000]  this super high grade clean
[44:00.000 --> 44:01.000]  unbound
[44:01.000 --> 44:03.000]  properly certified iodine
[44:03.000 --> 44:04.000]  of a totally different type
[44:04.000 --> 44:06.000]  and I love how they put a promo together
[44:06.000 --> 44:08.000]  that shows mainstream news saying
[44:08.000 --> 44:10.000]  do not take store bought iodine
[44:10.000 --> 44:11.000]  it can kill you
[44:11.000 --> 44:13.000]  this is a topical type
[44:13.000 --> 44:14.000]  I mean I'm just telling you
[44:14.000 --> 44:16.000]  what is a known fact
[44:16.000 --> 44:19.000]  but again they need to make it sound weird
[44:19.000 --> 44:20.000]  everybody knows about ox bone
[44:20.000 --> 44:22.000]  beef bone
[44:22.000 --> 44:24.000]  the marrow having the
[44:24.000 --> 44:27.000]  stem cells in it
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.000]  anybody who's smart
[44:29.000 --> 44:30.000]  anybody from the country
[44:30.000 --> 44:31.000]  anybody from Europe
[44:31.000 --> 44:32.000]  especially that's where bone broth
[44:32.000 --> 44:33.000]  big over there
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  everybody knows you're sick
[44:35.000 --> 44:36.000]  you take bone broth
[44:36.000 --> 44:37.000]  everybody knows in weight loss
[44:37.000 --> 44:39.000]  they do these bone broth
[44:39.000 --> 44:41.000]  juice fats that are just
[44:41.000 --> 44:43.000]  in the craze for 20 years in Hollywood
[44:43.000 --> 44:44.000]  because they actually work
[44:44.000 --> 44:46.000]  so I go out and I research
[44:46.000 --> 44:47.000]  the hottest thing is bone broth
[44:47.000 --> 44:49.000]  I find out there's hardly any competitors
[44:49.000 --> 44:51.000]  I find out the stuff they've got
[44:51.000 --> 44:53.000]  is watered down
[44:53.000 --> 44:55.000]  I set out with the top manufacturer
[44:55.000 --> 44:56.000]  in the company to put out
[44:56.000 --> 44:59.000]  the ultimate bone broth formula
[44:59.000 --> 45:01.000]  it becomes the national best seller
[45:01.000 --> 45:03.000]  it is now the national best seller
[45:03.000 --> 45:04.000]  of any bone broth product
[45:04.000 --> 45:06.000]  and it's their job on HBO
[45:06.000 --> 45:08.000]  to make that sound weird
[45:08.000 --> 45:10.000]  and say that it's the dry dust
[45:10.000 --> 45:12.000]  of domesticated bird skeletons
[45:12.000 --> 45:14.000]  he can technically say that
[45:14.000 --> 45:16.000]  because a chicken is a domesticated bird
[45:16.000 --> 45:17.000]  but it sounds really weird
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.000]  like I'm killing parrots
[45:19.000 --> 45:22.000]  and putting them in a blender or something
[45:22.000 --> 45:24.000]  again, that's their job
[45:24.000 --> 45:26.000]  take something that is as wholesome
[45:26.000 --> 45:27.000]  as it gets
[45:27.000 --> 45:30.000]  chicken noodle soup to the next level
[45:30.000 --> 45:31.000]  basically
[45:31.000 --> 45:33.000]  mixed with chaga mushroom
[45:33.000 --> 45:34.000]  turmeric
[45:34.000 --> 45:35.000]  bee pollen
[45:35.000 --> 45:37.000]  all of it
[45:37.000 --> 45:38.000]  they either make it sound weird
[45:38.000 --> 45:39.000]  I'm selling coffee
[45:39.000 --> 45:41.000]  just like D magazine did
[45:41.000 --> 45:42.000]  I'm a scammer
[45:42.000 --> 45:45.000]  I'm claiming coffee is really good
[45:45.000 --> 45:48.000]  they make fun of our toothpaste
[45:48.000 --> 45:50.000]  by the way the bubble gum
[45:50.000 --> 45:52.000]  without the peppermint
[45:52.000 --> 45:54.000]  and without the tea tree is in
[45:54.000 --> 45:55.000]  because it's a little too strong for kids
[45:55.000 --> 45:57.000]  our super blue is concentrated
[45:57.000 --> 45:58.000]  it's a best seller
[45:58.000 --> 45:59.000]  folks are reordering it at record numbers
[45:59.000 --> 46:00.000]  it's super popular
[46:00.000 --> 46:03.000]  because it works so good
[46:03.000 --> 46:06.000]  the bubble gum has been gone for again
[46:06.000 --> 46:08.000]  almost six months
[46:08.000 --> 46:10.000]  we're trying to fix our supply issues
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.000]  but we have to get in at the big national factory
[46:12.000 --> 46:14.000]  that makes toms of Maine everybody else
[46:14.000 --> 46:15.000]  and you gotta get the tubes in
[46:15.000 --> 46:16.000]  it's gotta all be prepared
[46:16.000 --> 46:18.000]  they gotta get the factory ready to run it
[46:18.000 --> 46:20.000]  and then you get in the queue
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.000]  and it's a hassle
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.000]  but bubble gum
[46:24.000 --> 46:26.000]  natural flavor is now back
[46:26.000 --> 46:27.000]  kids love it
[46:27.000 --> 46:29.000]  bubble gum is now back available
[46:29.000 --> 46:30.000]  4.7 stars
[46:30.000 --> 46:31.000]  does have the iodine
[46:31.000 --> 46:32.000]  does have the quintal silver
[46:32.000 --> 46:33.000]  but doesn't have
[46:33.000 --> 46:35.000]  the really strong peppermint in it
[46:35.000 --> 46:36.000]  that even for adults
[46:36.000 --> 46:37.000]  they say it's strong
[46:37.000 --> 46:38.000]  it's concentrated
[46:38.000 --> 46:39.000]  so that's back in stock now
[46:39.000 --> 46:41.000]  that's discounted
[46:41.000 --> 46:43.000]  out of the gates
[46:43.000 --> 46:45.000]  I said it isn't discounted
[46:45.000 --> 46:47.000]  I wanted to discount that 25%
[46:47.000 --> 46:48.000]  so I just came back in yesterday
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  and we're gonna add that to 25% off
[46:50.000 --> 46:51.000]  and notice it's not
[46:51.000 --> 46:53.000]  we're gonna sell that for $9.95
[46:53.000 --> 46:55.000]  now continuing ladies and gentlemen
[46:55.000 --> 46:57.000]  that's how you fund the operation
[46:57.000 --> 46:58.000]  and the globalists hate it
[46:58.000 --> 47:00.000]  but it's all ending today
[47:00.000 --> 47:01.000]  the free shipping
[47:01.000 --> 47:02.000]  all those specials
[47:02.000 --> 47:04.000]  50% off
[47:04.000 --> 47:05.000]  on the silver package
[47:05.000 --> 47:07.000]  66% off
[47:07.000 --> 47:09.000]  on the silver bullet colloidal silver
[47:09.000 --> 47:10.000]  the free shipping on top of it
[47:10.000 --> 47:12.000]  some of these items are lost
[47:12.000 --> 47:14.000]  leaders but I want you to experience
[47:14.000 --> 47:15.000]  how good they are
[47:15.000 --> 47:16.000]  and I want you to get
[47:16.000 --> 47:17.000]  either the chocolate flavor
[47:17.000 --> 47:18.000]  or strawberry flavor
[47:18.000 --> 47:20.000]  of the cave man
[47:20.000 --> 47:21.000]  ultimate cave man
[47:21.000 --> 47:24.000]  ultimate cave bone broth formula
[47:24.000 --> 47:25.000]  and I want you to try it
[47:25.000 --> 47:27.000]  with just water
[47:27.000 --> 47:30.000]  and taste okay
[47:30.000 --> 47:33.000]  and I want you to try it with milk
[47:33.000 --> 47:34.000]  and a few ice cubes
[47:34.000 --> 47:36.000]  and tell me if it doesn't
[47:36.000 --> 47:37.000]  taste delicious
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  the issue is though a lot of folks
[47:39.000 --> 47:40.000]  are using it for weight loss
[47:40.000 --> 47:44.000]  because it's so filling
[47:44.000 --> 47:45.000]  that's why some people now
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  are actually whipping it up in a blender
[47:47.000 --> 47:48.000]  and then freezing it
[47:48.000 --> 47:49.000]  and eating it like
[47:49.000 --> 47:50.000]  kind of like yogurt ice cream
[47:50.000 --> 47:51.000]  or something
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  I mean in fact we're going to do a whole
[47:53.000 --> 47:54.000]  I'm doing a taste test
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.000]  I think I'm going to
[47:56.000 --> 47:57.000]  go down on the hiking bike trail
[47:57.000 --> 47:58.000]  with a whole setup
[47:58.000 --> 47:59.000]  and do a taste test of it
[47:59.000 --> 48:02.000]  versus frosties
[48:02.000 --> 48:05.000]  from
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  some place like
[48:07.000 --> 48:08.000]  Wendy's
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  because I want to show people
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.000]  we did taste test with the propure
[48:12.000 --> 48:14.000]  Leanne did a few years ago down there
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  right next to tap water
[48:16.000 --> 48:19.000]  and everybody liked
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  our filtered water over tap water
[48:21.000 --> 48:22.000]  they're always saying tap water
[48:22.000 --> 48:23.000]  tastes so great
[48:23.000 --> 48:24.000]  tap water is so good
[48:24.000 --> 48:25.000]  you're insane
[48:25.000 --> 48:26.000]  if you're drinking tap water
[48:26.000 --> 48:27.000]  in most cities
[48:27.000 --> 48:28.000]  or even most small towns
[48:28.000 --> 48:29.000]  and most well waters contaminated
[48:29.000 --> 48:30.000]  you're nuts
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  and he says I'm a kook
[48:32.000 --> 48:34.000]  for selling water filters
[48:34.000 --> 48:35.000]  to protect you
[48:35.000 --> 48:36.000]  from estrogen mimickers
[48:36.000 --> 48:37.000]  and chemicals in the water
[48:37.000 --> 48:38.000]  absolutely
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  I'm trying to make money
[48:40.000 --> 48:41.000]  to fund our operation
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  while selling people things they need
[48:43.000 --> 48:44.000]  and that I personally use
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  yes that's what it's called
[48:46.000 --> 48:49.000]  symbiotic relationship
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  if I was a car dealer
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  I would go out and
[48:53.000 --> 48:56.000]  sell the cars that I personally like
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  you know do what you love
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  sell what you like
[49:00.000 --> 49:01.000]  sell good products
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.000]  sell products people get a great
[49:03.000 --> 49:07.000]  response off of
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  I want you to like it
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.000]  why would I put out
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  a bone broth formula
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  that tastes like crap
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  it took us over a year and a half
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  scores of different types
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  to finally get a recipe
[49:22.000 --> 49:23.000]  that tasted okay
[49:23.000 --> 49:25.000]  and I said on the full show
[49:25.000 --> 49:27.000]  okay he knows in that same video
[49:27.000 --> 49:28.000]  I said it tastes okay
[49:28.000 --> 49:29.000]  without the milk
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  it tastes so much better with the milk
[49:31.000 --> 49:32.000]  he knows that
[49:32.000 --> 49:33.000]  but he misrepresented to you
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  because he's a liar
[49:35.000 --> 49:36.000]  that's why I haven't properly responded yet
[49:36.000 --> 49:37.000]  because I'm going to show you
[49:37.000 --> 49:38.000]  what I fully said
[49:38.000 --> 49:39.000]  just like with Megan Kelly
[49:39.000 --> 49:40.000]  and I'm going to show you
[49:40.000 --> 49:41.000]  where he said I was a liar
[49:41.000 --> 49:42.000]  by editing it because
[49:42.000 --> 49:43.000]  he's not even a liar
[49:43.000 --> 49:46.000]  John Oliver is a facsimile
[49:46.000 --> 49:49.000]  he's like a computer program
[49:49.000 --> 49:50.000]  he's a guy that comes in
[49:50.000 --> 49:51.000]  and looks ironic
[49:51.000 --> 49:52.000]  and looks nerdly
[49:52.000 --> 49:53.000]  for his nerd audience
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  to make them feel less nerdly
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  and then he does little ironic faces
[49:57.000 --> 49:58.000]  and reads off a teleprompter
[49:58.000 --> 49:59.000]  written by in some cases
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  over a hundred different contributors
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  he took him weeks to put together
[50:03.000 --> 50:05.000]  a 20 minute piece on me
[50:05.000 --> 50:06.000]  everything they threw at us
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  total lies, total fraud
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  total scams, total deception
[50:10.000 --> 50:13.000]  upside down inversion of reality
[50:13.000 --> 50:14.000]  but it failed
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  because all your fake polls
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  and all your demonization pieces
[50:18.000 --> 50:19.000]  and all your misrepresenting
[50:19.000 --> 50:20.000]  what I've said and done
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  only affects the most brain dead
[50:22.000 --> 50:23.000]  drooling morons
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  that are still under your control
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  but I digress the big sales in today
[50:27.000 --> 50:28.000]  thank you all for supporting us
[50:28.000 --> 50:29.000]  but most importantly
[50:29.000 --> 50:30.000]  pray for the broadcast
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  and support our local affiliates
[50:32.000 --> 50:33.000]  support their local sponsors
[50:33.000 --> 50:34.000]  become a sponsor
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  or tithe every month
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  the local radio station
[50:38.000 --> 50:39.000]  send them $20
[50:39.000 --> 50:40.000]  a hundred dollars
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  or just spread the word
[50:42.000 --> 50:43.000]  about that local station
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  but that's another part of the equation
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  supporting those local affiliates
[50:47.000 --> 50:50.000]  we'll be right back on the other side
[50:50.000 --> 50:51.000]  with the fake polls
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  the latest on Obamacare
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  and so much more
[50:55.000 --> 50:56.000]  Eric Trump says president
[50:56.000 --> 50:57.000]  tougher than DC swamp
[50:57.000 --> 50:58.000]  carrying country on his back
[50:58.000 --> 51:00.000]  I totally agree
[51:00.000 --> 51:01.000]  a lot of folks want to sit on the fence
[51:01.000 --> 51:02.000]  about Trump, not me
[51:02.000 --> 51:05.000]  I'm all in because he's all in
[51:06.000 --> 51:08.000]  a great president once said
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  the nine most feared words
[51:10.000 --> 51:11.000]  in the English language
[51:11.000 --> 51:12.000]  I am from the government
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  and I'm here to help
[51:14.000 --> 51:15.000]  adequacy of loss
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  absorbing capacity

[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  that's the mandate approved by the G20
[51:20.000 --> 51:23.000]  the banks can steal your money
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  well they can't steal your gold and silver
[51:25.000 --> 51:26.000]  that you fully control
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.000]  you can have it delivered into an IRA
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  at a depository and lock and key
[51:30.000 --> 51:31.000]  where you can hide it
[51:31.000 --> 51:32.000]  where no one can find it
[51:32.000 --> 51:34.000]  not even your wife
[51:34.000 --> 51:35.000]  what?

[54:34.000 --> 54:35.000]  coming up the next hour
[54:35.000 --> 54:36.000]  I'm going to break all that down
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  and show how it's a fraud
[54:38.000 --> 54:41.000]  and go over the history of that information
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  Vanessa Sousa is going to be joining us
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.000]  he's got a new book out
[54:45.000 --> 54:47.000]  that is very powerful
[54:47.000 --> 54:48.000]  The Big Lie
[54:48.000 --> 54:51.000]  exposing the Nazi roots of the American Left
[54:51.000 --> 54:52.000]  wait till you hear this
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  you think you know it all believe me
[54:54.000 --> 54:55.000]  I even learned some stuff
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  James Wesley Rawls is joining us
[54:57.000 --> 54:58.000]  Mark Goldman is joining us
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  Roger Stone is joining us
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  it's all coming up today
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  but first I saw this number yesterday
[55:04.000 --> 55:07.000]  and it even shocked me
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  from Interpol
[55:09.000 --> 55:12.000]  previously 80%
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  of the quote
[55:14.000 --> 55:15.000]  refugees coming into Europe
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.000]  now it's 10 million according to the UN
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  they run the EU
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  migrant program and they flood your country
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  we're military aged men
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  and I knew that less than 1% were Christian
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  even though 20% roughly of Syria was Christian
[55:27.000 --> 55:30.000]  until the ethnic cleansing of the globalist
[55:30.000 --> 55:33.000]  well now it's being reported that just over 1%
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  of migrants arriving in Italy
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  are Syrian refugees
[55:37.000 --> 55:40.000]  this according to the Italian government
[55:40.000 --> 55:43.000]  that articles up on infowars.com
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  isn't that just cute
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  just 1% of migrants arriving in Italy
[55:47.000 --> 55:48.000]  are Syrian refugees
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  and most so-called Syrians that were there
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  are folks that invaded Syria
[55:52.000 --> 55:55.000]  as part of the Arab Spring
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  Syria is not really Arab
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  but it's always getting invaded by the Arabs
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  I tell you get things in the Middle East
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  you go steal them
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  new figures show that just 1.4% of migrants
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  arriving in Italy are Syrian refugees
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  confirming the fact that the overwhelming majority
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  of people flooding into Europe
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  or economic migrants from countries not at war
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  but they just say oh they're
[56:15.000 --> 56:18.000]  war-torn Christians when they're not
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  or they always say oh it's boys
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  it's children that are
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.000]  it's boys that raped and killed a woman
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.000]  kind of like oh we're letting
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  children in from Mexico
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  that most of them aren't from Mexico
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  and most of them aren't children
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  something like 17% were under the age of 18
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  but the children are here
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  yes one guy got deported
[56:38.000 --> 56:40.000]  20 times
[56:40.000 --> 56:42.000]  and he just got indicted again for
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  more criminal activity
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  the numbers obtained by the
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  Westminster via Eurostat
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  the official body
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  tasked with providing statistical information
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.000]  the institution of the European Union
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  underscores how the true nature of the migrant crisis
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  is being completely misrepresented by the press
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  left-wing groups and politicians
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  and it goes on to say that
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  out of 58,000 they sampled
[57:06.000 --> 57:08.000]  just 845 were
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  supposedly Syrians
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  and most of them weren't even Syrians either
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  if you look at those numbers
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  meanwhile
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  there's a story by Kit Daniels
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  breaking more of this down
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  report 71% of Italians
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  oppose migrant invasion
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  that's a Dan Lyman report
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  yet I guess handed it to me
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  panic building as migrants flood Italy
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  in tidal waves
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  and the answer of course is a new EU navy
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  to make sure that the Italian navy doesn't
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  stop them or turn them back
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  from the Soros Zodiac boats
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  that go out and pick them up on the
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  coast of Libya and then bring them
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  back in to rape, kill
[57:48.000 --> 57:50.000]  and destroy
[57:50.000 --> 57:52.000]  then they tell Europeans
[57:52.000 --> 57:54.000]  you've got to get rid of your free speech
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.000]  to comply with Sharia
[57:56.000 --> 57:58.000]  and they air TV ads from Italy to Germany
[57:58.000 --> 58:00.000]  showing women in Hajjibs saying
[58:00.000 --> 58:02.000]  do you wear the Hajjib, do you join Islam
[58:02.000 --> 58:04.000]  Islam is good, join Islam today
[58:04.000 --> 58:06.000]  official UN reports
[58:06.000 --> 58:08.000]  and now
[58:08.000 --> 58:10.000]  the
[58:10.000 --> 58:12.000]  Scottish government is defending TV
[58:12.000 --> 58:14.000]  pieces they funded and art pieces they funded
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  with black people dancing around saying
[58:16.000 --> 58:18.000]  Scots are scum and will be defeated
[58:18.000 --> 58:20.000]  they will be bred out
[58:20.000 --> 58:22.000]  you are inbred, you are scum
[58:22.000 --> 58:24.000]  you will die
[58:24.000 --> 58:26.000]  there's a new article and the government says
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.000]  yes and it's black guys dancing around going
[58:28.000 --> 58:30.000]  you are white, you are scum, you will die
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  I mean
[58:32.000 --> 58:34.000]  and you're just like what is going on here
[58:34.000 --> 58:36.000]  well the globalists have already exploited the third world
[58:36.000 --> 58:38.000]  they can look at the demographics
[58:38.000 --> 58:40.000]  they're going to turn the minorities are bringing in racist
[58:40.000 --> 58:42.000]  they're going to totally balkanize society with it
[58:42.000 --> 58:44.000]  this is a military
[58:44.000 --> 58:46.000]  hacking ball operation
[58:46.000 --> 58:48.000]  run by Soros the democratic party and the globalist
[58:48.000 --> 58:50.000]  I mean it's incredible
[58:50.000 --> 58:52.000]  second hour coming up
[58:56.000 --> 58:58.000]  as most of you already know
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.000]  I am a voracious consumer of news
[59:00.000 --> 59:02.000]  and information and in the last
[59:02.000 --> 59:04.000]  four or five years doing more and more research
[59:04.000 --> 59:06.000]  I came across the fact that
[59:06.000 --> 59:08.000]  the elite establishment is
[59:08.000 --> 59:10.000]  fully aware of the fact that our ancient
[59:10.000 --> 59:12.000]  ancestors in many cases had much
[59:12.000 --> 59:14.000]  better nutrition than we do today
[59:14.000 --> 59:16.000]  and our ancient ancestors
[59:16.000 --> 59:18.000]  sought out the bones of the animals
[59:18.000 --> 59:20.000]  that they were hunting, killing and then
[59:20.000 --> 59:22.000]  processing and so I set out
[59:22.000 --> 59:24.000]  to develop caveman but to not just have
[59:24.000 --> 59:26.000]  concentrated bone broth
[59:26.000 --> 59:28.000]  from chicken but seven other
[59:28.000 --> 59:30.000]  superfood ingredients
[59:30.000 --> 59:32.000]  known for cleansing and
[59:32.000 --> 59:34.000]  supercharging the body at the same time
[59:34.000 --> 59:36.000]  info wars isn't just fighting
[59:36.000 --> 59:38.000]  the globalist we're getting results
[59:38.000 --> 59:40.000]  and we're expanding in the face
[59:40.000 --> 59:42.000]  of the complete media assault
[59:42.000 --> 59:44.000]  and winning because of your
[59:44.000 --> 59:46.000]  support caveman is finally back
[59:46.000 --> 59:48.000]  at the info wars store you can get

[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  we now take you live to the
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  central texas command center
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  in the heart of the resistance
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  you're listening to alex jones
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  so youtube's announcing
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:52.080]  censorship of anything, conservative, libertarian, or patriotic, or common sense. Facebook, Twitter,
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:55.320]  YouTube, they're all doing it, and they're hiring these lynch mobs that are given the
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:59.840]  power to go out and declare things evil or racist so they can then be banned. You know,
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:06.080]  like the word mother or father, now a professor who refuses to stop saying men and women exist
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:09.840]  has been banned from YouTube. That's coming up in the next segment with Dinesh D'Souza,
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:12.960]  but first is a report on Twitter lynch mobs.
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:16.880]  Twitter allows you to spread information instantly. Tweets can go viral within minutes and narratives
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:21.920]  formed even faster. Upon a cursory consideration, one might believe this is a positive thing.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:27.680]  However, it's often the case that narratives can spread first, while the facts trail far, far behind.
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:32.240]  If a tweet appears to confirm our fondest hopes or darkest fears, it's only natural that we'd
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:36.160]  instantly hit that retweet button with little consideration for its veracity. The ability
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:41.280]  to breed in-group solidarity with one click leads to an abandonment of basic evidentiary standards.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:45.920]  That's human nature and it's understandable. This tweet first-think-later approach predictably
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:51.280]  leads to kangaroo courts of public opinion, essentially mob rule. This phenomenon manifested
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:56.160]  itself on Twitter when 35,000 individuals retweeted a photo of a man that was accused of randomly
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.960]  pulling the headpiece off a Muslim. The tweets read,
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:02.960]  This man at Baker Street forcefully attempted to pull my hijab off. When I instinctively grabbed
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:07.040]  a hold of my scarf, he hit me. He proceeded to verbally abuse my friends and I, pinning one of
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:11.360]  them against the wall and spinning in her face. Over 2,000 users angrily condemned the man and
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:15.440]  claimed that they would like to violently attack him. Many more called for his name, phone number,
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:20.000]  and work and home address as to be published to presumably harass him for this most contemptible
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.720]  act. One problem, though initially there were many calls to violence and harassment, there were
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:28.560]  not very many tweets to the tune of, perhaps we should wait till the police investigate,
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:34.400]  after all we've only heard one side of the story. Confirmation bias had swept thousands away, like
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:38.960]  an engorged river after heavy rainfall. Not even verified Twitter accounts were safe,
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:42.880]  as they began sickening their followers on the man. This is so awful, I retweeted,
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:48.080]  I hope they find this horrible person and lock him up. Hundreds of thousands of cursory observers
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:53.120]  saw hundreds of tweets and articles pour in that made them feel morally righteous and tingly inside.
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:57.920]  In their mind, it was an indisputable fact that this man was an unadulterated racist Islamophobe
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:03.520]  or something. So naturally it became their moral obligation to insert a valuable half second into
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:08.400]  retweeting this. But taking a few minutes to assess the preponderance of evidence would be, I think,
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:14.000]  a much more reasonable approach to this accusation, then someone should have pushed him onto the tracks.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.920]  See, a cursory investigation of the available information revealed that there was indeed
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:21.760]  another side to the story. The man accused of attacking and tearing away this woman's hijab
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:25.360]  made this statement, quote, in regard to recent evidence, I was accused of completely false
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:29.200]  allegation because I defended my partner by trying to completely defuse a racist attack
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:32.560]  from three other random females. As a result, one of the females in particular
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:36.400]  responded by making malicious completely false allegations against me and I would like to confirm
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:41.120]  I never hit or attacked anyone. I simply defused a situation by separating them. The police is
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:45.360]  fully cooperating with me and will be able to obtain CCTV footage showing the three women
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:50.480]  attempting to attack my partner because we are in an interracial relationship, end quote.
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:54.720]  So two completely conflicting stories, one of which sounding patently more reasonable than the
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.640]  other. Not to mention that this woman did not appear willing to stand by her tweet as it has
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:03.200]  now been deleted, banishing it into the twitlight zone. Regardless, it would appear we'd need to
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:07.600]  see evidence before jumping to conclusions. All right, the full video is up on infowars.com.
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:11.680]  It's far worse than this. They encourage on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter the left going
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:16.560]  out and doing this on purpose. It's like J.K. Rowling's saying that Trump wouldn't shake the
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:21.680]  little kid in the wheelchair's hand. When he goes over first to him, hugs him, pats on him,
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:25.520]  talks to him more than all the other people basically combined, then later he's walking
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:30.320]  out, little kid reaches for him. Trump doesn't see it, so that's his fault. Just like when the
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:35.040]  Polish president and his wife walk out, Trump's wife reaches out first, so the Polish president
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:39.440]  shakes her hand first, then Trump's. Kind of like somebody walks up, you both shake your hands out,
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:43.520]  you shake the woman's first, then you shake the other one. It isn't a diss, but it's all about
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:48.880]  shunning and it's all about keeping people in a rested development junior high mentality like
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:54.640]  we're in the third grade and who is the cool kid. That role, that's what modern leftism is,
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:05:00.160]  is creating a rested development, isolated, alone individuals who can be controlled by AI systems
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:03.600]  according to Facebook's own documents linked to the Australian three months ago.
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:13.120]  December 23rd, 1776. These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:17.840]  Sunshine Patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of their country, but he that stands
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:23.760]  by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:28.480]  conquered yet we have this consolation with us that the harder the conflict, the more glorious
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:34.560]  the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly. It is dearness only that gives everything
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:40.560]  its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods and it would be strange indeed if so
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:45.920]  celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated. Britain, with an army to enforce
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:51.440]  her tyranny, has declared that she has a right not only to tax, but to bind us in all cases
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:56.880]  whatsoever. And if being bound in that matter is not slavery, then there is no such thing as slavery
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:02.720]  upon earth. Even the expression is impious, for so unlimited a power can only belong to God.

[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:49.200]  to actually look at attacks on white people, racial attacks on white folks.
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:54.000]  The Justice Department's also announced they're going to look at whites being kicked out of
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:01.440]  higher education. And the leftist media MSNBC, you name it, is calling this racist.
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:07.280]  Because they now teach, as you see every day in Europe and the United States, that being white
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:13.040]  is inherently evil. And that whites are these mutants. And that we have to be gotten rid of.
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:16.880]  I mean, I've got three articles in mainstream news with the Scottish government funding it,
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:21.920]  the US government funding it. We see colleges in Oregon having weekends where the whites aren't
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:28.400]  allowed and liberal professors even say, well, that's racist. And then they get driven off campus.
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:37.200]  This is by design. The differences we've contained it on the universities and the federal government.
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:43.440]  So they're eating their own now. And that's what's happening is because the most radical elements
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:47.840]  are then dominating the debate in the leftist echo chambers and creating
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:53.040]  fascism. And I've said that many times, and that's what the next to Susan Breaks down,
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:57.440]  stop that he's plagiarizing me or I'm plagiarizing him. We're looking at the same thing.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:02.160]  So we're both at the Grand Canyon, the same spot. So what do you see? I see the biggest canyon in
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:06.720]  the world is beautiful. Yeah, you know, look at that. Look at that blue jay sitting in the tree.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:12.640]  Well, we're looking at this and we're seeing frothing people hitting women in the head with
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:18.960]  bike locks, macing men, women and children, uh, beating people where they're putting comas.
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:23.280]  And it's in the wiki leaks that Hillary Clinton sent them out there. Then the media turns around
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:29.040]  and says that libertarians or conservatives did it. And so the very same Democratic Party that
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:35.680]  was the party of race baiting and of the KKK has flipped it now, looked at demographics and is
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:42.720]  trying to turn minorities that are the new majority about to be the super majority into
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:49.280]  race based operatives as well. Instead of it being based on a culture of free market, prosperity
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:53.840]  and free association. The book's excellent. I don't want to carry it in for store.com,
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:59.280]  but we're not yet the big lie exposing the Nazi roots of the American left, the national
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:05.680]  who's also was a political prisoner, got five of his friends to give money to a Senate candidate
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:11.280]  that was his friend from college, didn't sign the right paperwork. Meanwhile, Hillary, it's
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:18.240]  30 million for, you know, Russian uranium transfers of us uranium, 12 million in Morocco
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:22.880]  to sell out our interest. It's simply incredible. And now they're calling for me to be criminally
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:28.480]  arrested in Newsweek. And they've got congressional hearings saying I'm a Russian spy with no proof
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:32.320]  and that I'm under criminal investigation. So this is quite a club to be in here.
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:37.200]  These people are dangerous folks and they're lying to a new level. So it's not just political
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:42.880]  violence. They're now lying violently. Newsweek last week said that I'm calling for, quote,
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:48.240]  killing more liberals. They don't show a grass set it. They don't show a link. They just lie.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:55.280]  So they've gone into an insane mode and they're very dangerous. They're putting out fake polls
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:59.360]  of the president, just like they did with Hillary, the big lie exposing the Nazi roots of the American
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:05.360]  left, Vanessa Suza, documentary filmmaker, former cabinet official, a department head
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.280]  in the Reagan administration joining us to talk about the big lie. I mean, you've heard me kind of
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:17.680]  set up the interview. There's so many examples. It's so wild. I know it's so crazy now.
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:25.600]  I mean, you rightfully say that we're going from the left being racist to fascist.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:35.360]  What's really happening here? Well, I think what's remarkable is that the new fascism of our time
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:44.400]  marches behind the banner of anti-fascism. So that when you look at the people who are wearing
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:52.240]  masks, carrying weapons, blocking people from speaking, relying on a kind of intimidation
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:59.920]  and terrorism to cow everybody into silence, these are the modern day equivalents of Mussolini's
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:04.720]  black shirts and Hitler's brown shirts. The difference is that the black shirts and the
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:09.760]  brown shirts happily wore the label. Whereas these new guys call themselves Antifa,
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:16.960]  they pretend to be fighting fascism. So the fascist theme is back in American politics.
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:23.680]  They're trying to pin the fascist label on Trump, on the Republicans. They have for a long time
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:29.680]  been cultivating the idea that fascism is a phenomenon of the right. We've all been taught
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:36.800]  that, that on the left you might have communism, but on the right you have fascism. And this lie
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:43.520]  is given some plausibility by the fact that Hitler and Stalin fought against each other in World War
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:49.200]  II. So it appears like they must be ideological opposites. But remember that Hitler and Stalin
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:55.760]  were allied at the beginning, until Hitler turned on Stalin. In reality, fascism and
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:14:02.000]  communism are not that far apart. Their battle should be, is better understood, like the battle
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:08.720]  between the Shia and the Sunni, very bitter battle to be sure, but both operating from within the
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:16.800]  house of Islam. And so similarly, fascism and communism are two species of collectivism vying
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:23.360]  for power. And the whole idea that fascism and Nazism are on the right, that's a big, big lie.
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:29.600]  I personally go out on the street now, and I have leftists come over
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:36.640]  and tell me they want to physically attack me and just hiss and yell and say Russian spy or Nazi,
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:42.320]  just all these comical things. Don't they realize they're in black running around trying to bar
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:45.920]  people from speaking? They're running around trying to intimidate people. They're telling
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:50.800]  us what language to use. They're telling us hyper-political correctness. They're teaching
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:56.640]  classical racism now in mainstream news with MTV shows about the problem of being white.
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:02.320]  I mean, it's just insanity. And I'm not giving the quote minorities a pass here, but it's mainly
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:09.200]  led by university professors and people that are white, but they're creating their new cadres to
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:14.080]  lead the minorities who are the majority when you put them together into this system. And they're
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:20.480]  saying Trump won because of inherent racism when it was the left that ran the campaign on a race
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:28.960]  based system. Yes, not only is the left tactically fascist, not only are they using the sort of
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:36.400]  tactics of the neon of the Nazis, but they also have the ideology of the Nazis. Let's remember
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:44.560]  that Nazism and fascism were both variants of socialism. Hitler's party was called the National
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:51.520]  Socialist Party. The very word Nazi is putting together national and socialista. That's where
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:59.040]  we get the sound Nazi. Mussolini was a Marxist. He was the leader of the Italian Socialist Party.
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:05.440]  He was recognized to be on the left. He saw himself as on the left. When Mussolini came to power,
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:12.320]  Lenin sent him a telegram of congratulations. Why? Because Lenin recognized that Mussolini
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:19.760]  was a fellow revolutionary of the left. So what an incredible sleight of hand in which these leftists
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:26.160]  whose political platform reads like it's right out of the Democratic party platform.
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:30.240]  And by the way, this is something you're absolutely right. This is something that
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:34.880]  leftist universities say that we're lying about and a real hot point from them because
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:40.320]  it's a fact the Nazis were National Socialist. It's a fact that he modeled himself after the
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:45.680]  fascistas in Italy. It's a fact they wore black. It's a fact they wore masks. It's a fact they beat
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:52.000]  up their opposition. It's a fact that Hitler then turned against Stalin. They admired each other back
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:59.600]  and forth because he was seen as a rival politically and a rival militarily. But they had an alliance
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:05.040]  for the first year of the war where they divided Poland amongst each other. So we had the Warsaw
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:12.480]  Pact. They hope that's not known that they are authoritarian and that socialism and fascism
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:19.200]  have different and left-right versions and that it was the American left that backed Hitler early on
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:25.200]  because he was a vegetarian and a bunch of other issues and he wanted planning of society. This is
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:31.280]  incontrovertible that the KKK was founded by the Democratic Party. It is incontrovertible
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:37.600]  that the Republicans passed the Civil Rights Act and took that system away from them and they panicked.
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:43.360]  It is incontrovertible that the power structure got scared of American Christians and American
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:50.480]  Republicans and Eisenhower and created this whole new strategy to get everybody to go,
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:54.640]  oh, you're going to be liberal. You're going to be anti-racist. We'll take it over and make it
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:18:01.440]  extreme, own it, then double-cross you later and make everything race-based again once whites
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:06.400]  have been taught to bow down as long as you say something's for racial equality. So they're using
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:12.560]  our goodness, our bigness, our Christian Western ethos that unifies who deny the West is the most
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:22.000]  open to then bring us down. Yes, I'll add to your list of incontrovertibles. It is incontrovertible
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:28.960]  and I document this in the book that Hitler got this specific blueprint for the Nuremberg laws,
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:34.400]  the laws that discriminated against Jews, segregated them into ghettos, later confiscated
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:40.640]  their property, state-sponsored discrimination. These laws are not just, you may say, and they're
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:46.720]  not just similar to the Jim Crow laws of the Democratic South, the Nazis actually used the
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:52.880]  blueprint of the Democratic laws. And Margaret Sanger, and it's incredible, it's incredible.
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:59.200]  It's incredible. Your book documents it all. And Margaret Sanger, Hitler kept a book of her
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:04.320]  signed by his bed. They wrote love letters to each other. The Rockefeller Foundation funded
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:09.200]  it all. The Rockefeller Foundation created the UN. The Rockefeller Foundation literally
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:14.560]  runs all this. So with your book, your research, your international skills, what is their master
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:20.400]  plan now? Because it's incontrovertible, a planned fascist society with no free speech,
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:24.320]  getting everybody to fight with each other over racial identity, sexual identity,
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:28.000]  putting us all in our ghettos controlled by a superstate. Is that not the plan?
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:37.360]  Well, you know, we're obviously going to be under the accusation of exaggerating, of being paranoid.
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:43.680]  Dinesh, how can you use this term fascist? Now, here's my point. If we actually look at the policies
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:51.760]  of Obama, the policies supported now by Elizabeth Warren and by Bernie, I want to raise a question.
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:59.200]  Are these economic policies more accurately called socialist in the Marxist sense or fascist?
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:06.240]  Remember that the core meaning of fascism in economic terms is state run capitalism.
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:12.320]  And if you look at what the progressives are all about, they're not really pursuing socialism,
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:17.600]  per se. The socialists in every country want to nationalize industry. They want the government to
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:25.440]  actually nationalize and own the energy sector, the banks and so on. Obviously, we still have
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:29.840]  private hospitals, we have private insurance companies, but the government is telling them
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:35.920]  what to do. The government is setting prices. Under Obama, we've seen government regulation
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:40.320]  expand dramatically. It's a cult of power. They use social engineering against this.
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:44.400]  They use race to control us because they know how powerful it is. What do we do then when
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:49.360]  them double crossing the Christian ethos of bringing people together? They've used our strength
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:55.520]  against us. What do we do? So basically, we need, in my last chapter, it's called denotification.
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:21:00.960]  And what that means is we've got to realize that we're actually facing a very bad bunch of guys
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:06.880]  who are willing to stop at nothing. We need knowledge and then we need courageous action.
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:10.880]  So the knowledge is in the book. It's going to equip you. It's going to help you to
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:16.560]  fire back and move fascism out of the right wing column, back into the left wing column,
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:22.080]  where it belongs. But knowledge is not enough. We've got to realize that we're dealing with
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:26.800]  people who are willing to break the law, who are willing to cause physical harm and destruction.
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:31.840]  We have to hold these people accountable. During the Civil War, when Abraham Lincoln
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:37.760]  found out that the Confederates were executing free blacks, he issued an order that he acknowledged
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:43.840]  was barbaric. He said, for every free black executed by the Confederacy, I am going to shoot
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:48.720]  one Confederate soldier. Now, he understood that this was very tough, but he realized,
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:53.440]  how else are we going to get these people to stop? I think we need to realize that we need
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:22:00.080]  to impose the law in a very tough way on these new fascists who are posing as anti-fascists.
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:05.840]  That's the only way to stop them. We need a new kind of Republican to actually carry this out.
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:10.960]  What do we do about the minorities that they have whipped? Even though that's not really the most
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:15.600]  out of control group I've seen, but we see the racial attacks on whites, on others,
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:21.040]  on Asians being killed, being beaten to death, the knockout game. It's in the news every day,
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:26.080]  but the media white washes it. Islamists is being brought into Europe into here, the rape gangs,
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:31.120]  the coverups, the left banning people that criticize radical Islam. I mean, they're really
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:36.480]  coming in with massive censorship right now, calling us the racists, saying censor us, and a
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:41.600]  lot of folks have fallen for the trap going, we're not racists, don't censor us, instead of, hey,
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:47.600]  allow free speech on YouTube, on Google, on Facebook, and on Twitter, because once you start
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:51.520]  censoring one group, you'll censor everybody. I think we're losing the debate here because we
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:56.400]  argue we're not racists, which is true, but they don't care. Once they set the precedent to ban
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:23:03.360]  racists, they have the precedent to ban their opposition. Yeah, the Democrats have always
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:09.760]  been the party of racial consciousness, of racial discrimination. And you might say that in a sense,
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:14.480]  they're doing the same thing now, only in the opposite direction. They've created this kind
[01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:22.080]  of multicultural tent. They supposedly ask every group to affirm its racial identity. Hey, blacks,
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:27.040]  you need to be proud of being black. Black is beautiful. Hey, Asians, you've got to be proud
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:33.120]  of being Asian and so on, except whites. So there's a kind of exemption for whites, and everybody's
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:38.720]  encouraged to gang up, you might say, on the whites. Naturally, this has created a volatile
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:45.120]  situation. This, I think, helps to explain why some sort of white nationalists go, Trump is our only
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:50.080]  hope, because there is no, they would normally be in the Democratic Party, but the Democratic Party
[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:56.960]  has constructed itself in such a way that there's room for every kind of ethnic nationalism, except
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:24:02.240]  white nationalists. And I agree. And again, it's so cartoonish, and it's standard procedure. It's not
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:07.360]  like the radicals of the Democrats are doing this. It's in the WikiLeaks. They say, we're losing,
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:11.920]  and we're going to lose to this Republican idea and libertarian idea of economic empowerment.
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:18.080]  We've got to go to culture war, and they talk about using race baiting, and it's so cartoonish,
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:22.960]  the stuff they're doing all over the news, saying whites are inherently evil and having
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:27.840]  college courses about we must exterminate and get rid of whites and feminist magazines saying,
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:32.000]  if you're white and have a white baby, abort it. I mean, this is cuckoo level.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:38.480]  It completely is. And here I think we have to give Trump a little bit of credit, because in my
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:44.080]  lifetime, he's the only president that I've seen who understands that he needs to fight not just
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:50.720]  a political war, but a culture war. And Reagan whom I adore, I was a young Reaganite in the 80s,
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:55.600]  but Reagan's view was you can't change the world in 10 ways or 20 ways. You can change the world
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:01.440]  in maybe one or two ways. So Reagan focused on the Soviet Union. He focused on taxation. And
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:06.960]  that's about it. But with Trump, here's a guy who's pulling us out of the trade pack and fighting
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:11.680]  to change Obamacare, and he's put Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. And at the same time,
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:16.480]  he's swatting Meryl Streep and whopping Saturday Night Live, and he's taken on CNN.
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:22.000]  This guy for a guy in his 70s is energetic on all fronts. And I got to say, I like that.
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:26.560]  Well, you say you got to give him a little credit. I totally agree with you.
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:29.920]  Eric Trump has pointed out that he's tougher than the swamp creatures,
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:34.400]  and is carrying the country on his back. How can you not marble somebody that
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:40.560]  defeated the fake polls, defeated the rig debates, came from behind one big time,
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:46.400]  and has now killed TPP, killed the carbon tax that was mentioned, literally deindustrialized us,
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:51.360]  gotten the stock market up $3 trillion, despite the Federal Reserve raising interest rates,
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:56.720]  69% reduction in illegals coming across the border, according to Homeland Security now in
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:01.200]  just six months. I mean, it goes on and on and on, breaking the back of political correctness,
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:05.120]  getting a good Supreme Court justice in. Of course, the deep state hates him,
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:09.040]  because they'd conquered this country, and now it's come back from the dead.
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:16.960]  It's unbelievable to see how so many in the Republican Party, they just don't get Trump,
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:23.280]  or at least Trump, they're scared of Trump. Part of it is that they worry Trump is going to blow
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:30.000]  up and blow them up with him. Part of it is that Trump acts in a way that is outside convention,
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:35.520]  and this completely immobilizes them, and some of them are actively opposed to Trump.
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:41.760]  Sometimes I feel in the intellectual sphere, I'm almost all by myself, the conservative
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:47.680]  intelligentsia has turned away from Trump, if not against Trump. This I think is intellectual
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:53.280]  suicide on the part of our side. This is a time where if we come together, victory is totally in our
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:59.280]  grasp. We can push back these, you know, this fascist strain in American culture. We have
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:04.960]  three branches of government to do it, and what the left is pulling out all the stops.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.320]  Well, a lot of these Republican establishment have been rhinos, Republican name only, as you know,
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:14.480]  and they have been there the whole time. They know they're in desperate straits.
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:17.600]  They want to be the ruling class. They don't want to send power back to the states
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:24.080]  and back to the people. So Jeff Flake comes out and says, I'm a globalist. I don't like Trump,
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:29.440]  and Democratic operatives, you know, on national TV like Stephanopoulos,
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:34.160]  celebrate the Republicans in the Senate, turning their back on Trump like this is some defeat of
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:41.280]  Trump. They're the problem. They're the ones that helped write Obamacare to begin with. It's Trump
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:47.840]  getting rid of the scam. His failure to repeal it is their failure, and it just makes him more of a
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:54.240]  champion. We must target them in the upcoming midterms. We must punish them, not look at Trumpism
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:28:00.560]  as a failure. As you said, victory is in our grasp. A global realignment is happening for
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:06.000]  nationalism, free market and common sense. The tide is going out. The elites even admit that,
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:11.520]  and so they want to run this mind game on us like National Review just wrote this big story,
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:16.000]  saying death of a salesman, that Trump's a total failure, always been a failure.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:21.360]  The guy's the biggest, you know, dark horse winner in modern American politics. The guy is
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:27.520]  nothing but a success story, a titan of resistance, a titan of going up against peer pressure,
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:32.960]  a titan of breaking the elites back. You know, for a whole generation since Reagan,
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:39.840]  we've had these absolutely intellectually shallow, incoherent Republican leaders.
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:44.400]  And the whole conservative intelligence here obediently lined up behind them,
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:49.840]  saluted what they did, even when it was abominably stupid. And now when Trump comes along,
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:56.160]  they go, he's not a conservative. He's acting in a more conservative way than George W. Bush,
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:01.760]  George H. W. Bush. He's certainly more conservative than McCain, let alone Bob Dole.
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:08.000]  So this is the most conservative president we've seen in a generation. And for the life of me,
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:13.680]  I cannot understand why the Bill Crystals of the world and all these dudes are acting as if
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:18.560]  Trump is some kind of a liberal in disguise. Because they're weak-minded and they care about
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:23.440]  mainstream media and the cocktail parties because they're old, they're part of the old system,
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:29.200]  they don't understand their time has come and gone. And obviously, you know, come from common
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:34.240]  folks who've been successful on your own action, just like myself and many others. And we're together
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:40.880]  for free market, for a future, for a system that is anti-racist, anti-tribal, and that is pro-human
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:47.120]  going to the stars. The book is The Big Lie, BigLieBook.com. Dinesh DeSousa, thanks for joining us.
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:52.640]  Look forward to having you back on again, my friend. Look forward to it. Powerful information.
[01:29:52.640 --> 01:30:01.760]  And we have another special guest joining us straight ahead. Empires on the Run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:45.120]  Today, everything the government does at every level is concealed from us. We have trade deals to
[01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:49.360]  manage our economy that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see. Later in
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:53.200]  life, Patrick Henry looked back and said, when the American spirit was in its youth,
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:58.000]  the language of America was different. Liberty, sir, was the primary object. Today,
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:20.240]  our primary concern is safety and comfort when we should be demanding liberty.
[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:35.200]  racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:41.440]  and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding until the only option left is for the police to
[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:47.680]  do their jobs and stop the madness. And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:55.440]  outrage. The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:32:02.800]  this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth. I'm the National Rifle Association of America
[01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:09.280]  and I'm Freedom's Safest Place. As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:14.480]  and information. And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:20.320]  fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:26.640]  cases, had much better nutrition than we do today. And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of
[01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:32.320]  the animals that they were hunting, killing and then processing. And so I set out to develop Caveman,
[01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:39.200]  but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients
[01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:45.280]  known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time. Info wars isn't just fighting
[01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:50.560]  the globalist. We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:56.400]  assault and winning because of your support. Caveman is finally back at the Info Wars store.
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:33:02.080]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at infowarslife.com or by
[01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:26.560]  calling toll-free AAA-2533139. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:36.560]  from the front lines of the Info War. Ladies and gentlemen, coming up at the start of the next
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:42.480]  hour, we have James Wesley Rawls popping in for 30 minutes. Then Mark Goldman is also going to be
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:50.960]  joining us. We just had Dinesh Sousa on. I want to get into some of the geopolitical news.
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:56.240]  I want to get into some of the tech news. It's really important. They've introduced legislation
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:34:03.680]  to not let your appliances spy on you with cameras and microphones. And yes, a lot of them have
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:07.920]  cameras and microphones built in, but that's only the beginning. They can dial into your other
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:12.560]  computers that do have cameras and microphones. So your dishwasher doesn't have a camera and
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:18.000]  microphone, but it's got a digital antenna that will pick it up and then transmit it. Get ready
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:26.320]  for this off another antenna or down your power line. Data over power line. I told everybody
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:30.480]  this 20-plus years ago. They didn't believe me. I showed you all the documents. It's now mainstream
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:37.920]  news. And they have waited to tell you about this in the Hill newspaper until it's already in place.
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:44.400]  And that's an algorithm I've noticed, where they only tell you about it once it's in place
[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:51.520]  to then pass some regulation so only the government can do it and then pose as the
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:58.560]  saviors over what they've designed on purpose. And I sit here and I watch this and I learn this and
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:07.440]  then decades later, I read white papers saying exactly what I'd already said myself. Because
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:14.560]  once you learn their philosophy, once you learn their operations, you've got them down. They
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:24.960]  operate like you're an idiot. Remember Gruber? He said, thank God, you're so stupid.
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:38.880]  Think heaven. You don't realize that Obamacare was written as a tax to private insurance companies
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:42.400]  to make the biggest profits they've ever made in the last five years.
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:47.840]  You wonder why the Republican leadership didn't shoot down Obamacare because they wrote it.
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:54.720]  And then Democrats run around giggling like, Trump lost, Trump lost, failure, failure.
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:36:00.960]  Ding dong, the witch is dead, the witch, oh, witch, the witch, witch, witch, ding dong, the wicked,
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:12.080]  witch is dead. We represent the lollipop guild, the lollipop guild, the lollipop guild.
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:20.160]  We represent the lollipop guild. And I look at the Democrats and I go, you understand the
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:24.000]  Republican leadership wrote this with Democrats and foreign banks to rape you.
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:31.680]  They go, thought you said it was insurance companies. And I went, that's who owns those, yes.
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:36.640]  Now you do understand they're ruthless and they wanted a corporate direct tax to them.
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:42.800]  That's what the carbon tax is and the wellhead and the digital tax, the Tobin tax. And they go,
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:47.920]  oh, talking fancy, trying to impress me. And I'm going, no, I'm your fellow human. I don't
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:53.040]  want to be a predator and join the elite and feed on you. Sure, you're trying to impress me.
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:59.840]  I'm like, no, I morally cannot do this to you. But instead of you just being fed on,
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:06.960]  you join the globalist to then help destroy me as well. So I really need you to wake up. But they
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:14.480]  don't care. They're delusional. People been brought up in such an artificial world, they learn how to
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:19.760]  make believe. And the mental illness is getting worse. I see it more and more people
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:25.120]  where they can't work, they can't do jobs, they just walk around like zombies,
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:32.960]  and they just fantasize about how big and powerful they are. And the mental illness is just exploding.
[01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:42.480]  Society is disintegrating. And then like giant zombie hordes, with all their ticks and all
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:51.280]  their weirdnesses and all their bizarre behaviors, the swarms of dysfunctional are just rising up
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:38:02.080]  like a plague. And they click and they cluck and they jibber and they just look completely mentally ill.
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:09.760]  But the computers and the robots and the automation keep producing them the food
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:14.240]  and the producing humans keep producing them a culture that they can then walk around on and
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:21.200]  judge and get mad at and demand things from and they're the globalist, engineer them and manipulate
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:31.920]  them until they're like a strip mining beam of mindless water at 100,000 pounds of pressure.
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:44.560]  They shoot out of a hose to cut through the mountain sites and strip mine our culture.
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:51.360]  Millennials are entitled, narcissistic and lazy, but it's not their fault. Expert claims every child
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:57.200]  wins a prize and social media has left generation Y unable to deal with the real world and they all
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:04.320]  fantasize that they are this ascendant super being that knows everything and is smarter than everyone.
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:16.400]  And they're fine to be around until they stub their toe or until they get a flat tire or until
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:21.440]  everything doesn't go just the way they want. And it's like being around a cult or studying a cult.
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:27.040]  You watch old videos of those ashrams and new age cults and stuff. Everyone's like, it's beautiful.
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:33.680]  We're all enlightened. Oh, it's so perfect. Yeah, you're in the cult while you drain mama and daddy's
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:37.920]  bank account while they're begging you to come back from California or come back from India or
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:42.800]  come back from wherever and you're there on a beautiful piece of property having free love.
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:48.480]  But as soon as all that runs out or you get pregnant and you get put to work in the kitchen,
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:55.280]  your child gets taken away and it's turned into a brainwashing servant. And that's what all this is
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:40:02.960]  is a giant cult with cult programmers like Schmidt and Zuckerberg and all of them sitting back in
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:06.880]  their own manuals and own memos because they don't care if you learn about it. They think you're an
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:13.840]  animal saying these scum these dumb aphors. When do we exterminate them? Well, the bio weapons tend
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:19.040]  to leech into general population even though we've got immunogenic blockers that will protect most
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:24.400]  of us. There's so many humans that with seven and a half billion if you wipe out say six billion,
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:29.440]  there'll be so much rioting and killing it'll bring down civilization. So the answer is the soft kill
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:34.640]  with the wavelengths protected the television and through other systems we can get them into a
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:40.800]  trance state and just slowly raise the level of cancer neurological disorders will make everybody
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:45.600]  that gets the disorders rock stars. There'll be lots of fundraisers for them. We'll give them
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:50.960]  participation medals for their for their death and then we'll just build that into the function
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:58.800]  and start phasing in the rollout of extermination which we're now about 30 years into. So loving,
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:06.080]  so liberal, so trendy. And then the trendies tune in and they hear it. They just make a big
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:12.000]  joke out of it and they have John Oliver make jokes about it. You notice most of these globalist
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:16.880]  operatives are not having kids because they understand the world and the future so hellish
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:22.000]  they're building and they're so selfish they believe they're going to merge with machines
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:28.560]  and become gods and all they are is an earlier version of the millennials super selfish super
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:35.280]  empty believing their gods because they can envision human potential and what they could become
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:40.480]  but instead of understanding it's through being honest and good and focused and strong
[01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:45.200]  and going through persecution that you become transcendent and and get a greater connection
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:51.520]  with God they believe just because they can imagine the potential that they are that potential
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:57.040]  and that they have realized that potential when they are fallen.
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:04.400]  And I don't say fallen because the Bible said so I can look at these globalists and look at
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:10.560]  their fruits and look at their minions and look at them I can tell you I don't want to be that
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:19.440]  elight that elite they are not the elite they are the elite of insanity the elite of unhappiness
[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:25.840]  the the the elite of stampeding around trying to trample others trying to find ascension
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:33.200]  they are desperately scared and they will be torn to shreds
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:41.200]  the delusional
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:49.520]  system is going to get worse and worse and worse as people buy into the matrix as they buy into
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:54.640]  the false reality as they buy into the bots as they buy into all of it and then they're blasted
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:58.960]  out into oblivion their consciousness rendered down
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:10.320]  destroyed and if you want to go down that path then so be it but at least you consciously
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:19.200]  have been warned up front now for going further let's go to this piece of
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:26.000]  Eric Trump on Sean Hannity is Sean Hannity perfect is Eric Trump perfect no but the entire
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:31.200]  evil globalist system it's anti-human and once a world where humans are obsolete hates them
[01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:38.320]  because they may be misguided in some cases but they really do want prosperity they really do get
[01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:46.240]  upset about the war on humanity the war on families the war on goodness and because they prize
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:52.160]  success and goodness and strength and wealth generated by work they are abhorred
[01:43:56.160 --> 01:44:04.640]  they absolutely are hated by the system and yes you can only admire trump people reveling
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:09.280]  being on both sides of the fence and telling some people they hate trump and other people
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:14.960]  they love trump oh do you like trump oh i like trump too do you hate trump oh i hate him too
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:21.520]  as if that's winning and getting you popular being no one playing games with other fake people
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:28.880]  that just virtue signal leadership is doing the right thing standing up for what you believe in
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:37.760]  and then moving forward people today think social climbing going along with the establishment
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:42.320]  that somehow that gets you ahead all you're giving up is your innate consciousness all
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:48.000]  you're giving up is your innate imprint on the universe and the world you're becoming a programmable
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:55.920]  bot so that other men can live and so you can sleep sleep your way into spiritual death
[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:07.440]  sleep your way into not being conscious sleep your way into signing a contract to be mesmerized
[01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:16.000]  by the siren song of the deception of this world to then agree to subjugate yourself
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:25.200]  and submit yourself to the most low disastrous fake wicked twisted hungry evil the universe has
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:39.840]  ever seen soul sucking in love with it here's eric trump he doesn't want to talk about it you talk
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:43.920]  about it the media just want to talk about it but you would think they would get on the bandwagon of
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:49.200]  what we have a stock market that's a hundred points off of you know record 22000 he's already
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:53.040]  at a record a broken other record that's true there's he's broken 30 records in the last you
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:58.160]  know three four months i mean it's just skyrocketing you look at oil prices and how good that is
[01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:02.640]  right for this you look at infrastructure all the pipelines and things that are going in you look
[01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:08.000]  at the military what he's doing you look at the va and what he's doing i mean tax reform which he
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:11.760]  obviously wants to get done which would be incredible for this country you look at consumer
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:17.040]  confidence you look at you know building in in america i mean so many incredible things that
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:21.680]  are being done and all they want to focus on is is russia and the scandal and i guarantee if you
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:25.760]  watch the mainstream media the only thing that they're going to talk about is anthony for the next
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:30.720]  you know two weeks or days whatever it is but they won't talk about the stock market they won't
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:36.480]  talk about people's 401ks they won't talk about the regulation gone the promises kept i mean it's
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:40.960]  everything this happened this country's four trillion dollars richer four trillion dollars
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:46.240]  richer under my father in the first six months on it as a point i mean where is the republicans
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:51.840]  and not only is going down repeal replace eric your father as he said you guys have made this
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:56.320]  promise now for seven years i have a pen in hand i'm ready to sign it and the things that your
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:47:01.200]  father made the can't promises on the campaign trail he's kept but not only that they've allowed
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:07.040]  this phony russian narrative to go out for so long but yet we've got ukraine collusion we got
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:13.040]  uranium one we got the email server scan which we know laws were broken you got combi leaking
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:18.400]  the general counsel we learned of the fbi last week is is leaking loretta lynch they're not even
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:24.960]  using the power of subpoena to investigate what i truly see is real evidence real crimes show my
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:29.200]  father said it i mean he said it a couple weeks ago in a in a tweet he said you know am i gonna
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:33.360]  have to carry this whole weight on my shoulder i mean when are some of the people in my own party
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:37.760]  are going to start protecting me and i feel as well listen i'm an outsider i'm looking in on the
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:42.640]  white house right i mean i'm running our company but i mean i want somebody to start fighting for
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:46.000]  him you know and he's he's the best fighter in the world he will do a better job fighting him
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:50.640]  first for himself then all of them will do fighting for him but i mean how much weight does he have
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:55.920]  to carry by himself how can a party that is doing so much better than the democrats if you look at
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:48:00.720]  how much more money the republicans are raising you look at the complete shambles that the dnc is
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:05.440]  you know isn't you know the dnc isn't dead the republicans are raising seven times on a monthly
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:10.720]  basis what the dnc are like why wouldn't they embrace that why wouldn't they carry out my father
[01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:15.280]  has the voice of this country because they're evil that's why country love him why wouldn't they get
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:20.640]  in line it doesn't make sense especially keep him back in a few seconds it's because they're
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:26.480]  putting out fake polls and the globalists pick the republicans they ran the last 30 40 years
[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:32.320]  to be the most empty social climbing nobodies and so they're all up there in the power structure
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:37.040]  and they don't like the fact that trump's taken away from him and given the general public prosperity
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:42.960]  they want to run it and control it even if they're running it in the ground they're globalist
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:49.280]  and so i see trump carrying the country on his back with our listeners and that's why they're
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:53.120]  trying to shoot down info wars it's why they're trying to demoralize you whether trying to tell
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:59.360]  you that we're losers or we're bad because we are saving the country you the listeners are the heart
[01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:07.200]  of this and trump is delivering it's insane and now they're saying they want a killing they want
[01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:12.560]  to removing they're trying to organize that and we're just calmly sitting here reporting on it
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:18.720]  because it's so radical how do you even report on something that crazy it makes you sound crazy

[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:28.960]  seven times on a monthly basis what the dnc are like why wouldn't they embrace that why wouldn't
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:34.560]  they carry out my father has the voice of this country the people of this country love him why
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:40.560]  wouldn't they get in line it doesn't make sense especially keeping promises a good politics eric
[01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:44.800]  that's right you want to raise money you want to do well you want to get reelected how about you
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:49.760]  you build the wall but we're not especially for fun repeal replace especially for a fundamentally
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:56.000]  broken system obama care has gone down the tubes it's a bankrupt system it's going to be
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:01.040]  subsidized insurance companies want nothing to do with it the best doctors aren't honoring it i mean
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:07.520]  premiums have gone up 100 200 in arizona 116 percent this year breaking so you see you mean to
[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:10.720]  tell me and by the way this goes for democrats as well you mean to tell me that there's not a
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:15.360]  single democrat on the opposite side of the aisle that doesn't see a single problem no with obama
[01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:19.520]  care that they wouldn't join forces they don't want your father to succeed of course of course they
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:23.360]  don't and i listen i say it all the time on fox i say it all the time just in general they would
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:32.240]  rather see this country fail than see my father said this is a total and complete act of mind
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:37.680]  control with their fake polls just like the campaign with the republican leadership trying
[01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:43.200]  to block trump at every level as they're raising the most money they've ever raised republicans
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:48.560]  are winning all across the united states the grassroots republicans are thanking trump
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:57.440]  they're thanking info wars but other folks are hedging their bets because they are preparing
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:03.360]  to try to assassinate the president and they still have big parts of the bureaucracy and people are
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:12.640]  scared they're scared of the cia they're scared of military special forces and all the different
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:18.800]  embedded hit teams that are in every town and city in the united states the naivete of the america
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:24.080]  people's gone to that and they think if deep state is able to take over again they're going to come
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:29.120]  after everybody we all better keep our heads down you're going to lose everything if you act like
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:35.440]  that folks and they've been intimidating and they've been threatening congress and most of these
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:44.080]  congressmen aren't men they get in line but the saddest people are the democrats the republican
[01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:49.760]  scum wrote obama care and you're defending it because you want trump to fail when it's a huge
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:59.600]  screw job what type of idiots are you but again they added nine and 15 points on average that was
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:07.200]  the two they would do more democrats to the polls they admitted that but some had 20 25 30 percent
[01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:15.600]  i told you i've seen 34 points in cnn methodology added for hillary 34 so when you see him in the
[01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:23.440]  polls at 38 or whatever know that the bots and the corporate numbers and the lackability numbers
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:27.120]  despite all the censorship and the rest of it to try to dampen this down and them
[01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:30.480]  unlikin trump tweets and all the rest of it which they admit they're doing
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:38.160]  he's still at close to 60 percent with quote likely voters well of course he is

[02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:59.520]  to go to a powerful report dealing with companies promoting microchipping and it turns out they did
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:04.080]  get the microchip over the weekend an article showing them bleeding all the rest of it from
[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:10.400]  this pr firm but here it is margher the beast getting pushed right here in america a woman in
[02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:15.920]  australia is now a combo of darth vader and the terminator thanks to some special implants here's
[02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:23.280]  an x-ray of her hands those circles are microchips they allow her to unlock doors without using a key
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:29.520]  kind of like the force she can also access her computer without a password
[02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:39.920]  problem solved many things start off with the best of intentions but sometimes intentions turn
[02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:45.600]  we've survived thousands of years as a species without being microchipped is there any particular
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:51.920]  need to do it now approximately 50 employees at three square market a vending machine technology
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:58.240]  company based in river falls wisconsin have decided to ignore the book of revelations eugenics the
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:04.800]  existence of the new world order and common sense to gleefully act as guinea pigs for the acceptance
[02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:11.360]  of microchip technology cnet proudly reports employees of three square won't have to worry
[02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:17.680]  about forgetting their employee id cards at home anymore starting next month a voluntary program
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:24.800]  will offer company employees the chance to get an rfid chip implanted in their hands the tiny
[02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:31.120]  chips will use nfc near field communication technology to allow employees to unlock doors
[02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:37.680]  make vending machine purchases log into computers and access office tools like photocopiers
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:43.040]  all with the wave of the hand what did the employees say when you brought this idea to them
[02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:48.720]  half of them actually within five seconds says yes what cnet doesn't tell you is that how long
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:54.960]  before one of the female employees has a chip implanted resulting in a terminated pregnancy
[02:02:54.960 --> 02:03:01.520]  or employees are remotely vaccinated in order to test eugenicist bill gates goals but that's
[02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:06.800]  called the death panel uh and you're not supposed to have that discussion this equation has four
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:12.160]  factors a little bit of multiplication so you've got a thing on the left co2 that you want to get
[02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:19.200]  to zero and that's going to be based on the number of people the services each person choosing on
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:27.280]  average the energy on average for each service and the co2 being put out a per unit of energy
[02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:33.440]  so let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero probably one of
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:39.040]  these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero now that's back from a high school
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:45.760]  algebra but let's let's take a look first we've got population now the world today has 6.8 billion
[02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:52.800]  people that's headed up to about nine billion now if we do a really great job on new vaccines
[02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:58.160]  health care reproductive health services we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent
[02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:03.920]  the bbc reports a contraceptive computer chip that can be controlled by remote control has
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:09.840]  been developed in massachusetts the chip is implanted under a woman's skin releasing a small dose of
[02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:16.000]  leaven or gestural a hormone the project has been backed by bill gates and will be submitted for
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:22.880]  pre-clinical testing in the u.s. next year and possibly go on sale by 2018 the same technology
[02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:27.520]  could be used to administer other drugs the innovation comes in a time when governments
[02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:34.000]  and organizations around the world have agreed to try to bring family planning to around 120
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:41.200]  million more women by 2020 usa today reports the company three square market is partnering
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:47.920]  with swedish company biohacks international which already has many chipped employees yeah

[02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:12.960]  self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain
[02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:17.840]  unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to
[02:05:17.840 --> 02:05:22.960]  secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the
[02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:28.000]  consent of the governor that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:33.840]  it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
[02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:40.960]  independence isn't a day it's a mindset an attitude that says i will not be your dependent
[02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:47.520]  i will not be your slave dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual
[02:05:47.520 --> 02:05:52.960]  infringements when you trade your liberty for safety to that extent you become their slave

[02:06:23.680 --> 02:06:29.440]  and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting killing and

[02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:38.720]  important thing to understand is this is an illusion that Trump's poll numbers are down

[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:54.400]  60% conservatively of likely voters they're just panicking because the Democrats are imploding
[02:09:54.400 --> 02:09:58.560]  they're catching the illegals and people voting in dead people's names everywhere

[02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:30.320]  this down survival blog.com james this ties into your big link the investigative reports
[02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:36.080]  antifa part one and two the antifa threat spiral break it down for us what are the
[02:13:36.080 --> 02:13:43.520]  globalists getting ready to do well alex i i think it's pretty clear that the antifa movement is
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:53.280]  being used as kind of the shock troops for their their goal of destabilizing the government
[02:13:53.280 --> 02:14:01.920]  they want to have a wave of uh protests and a followed by a wave of domestic terrorism
[02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:11.760]  in this country they want to destabilize they want to try to create a counter action by the
[02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:19.520]  trump administration they're hoping for a kent state type event where it would demoralize
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:26.880]  the american populace turn the populace against the trump administration and part of their overall
[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:35.360]  campaign to get trump out of office and i i think that if you look at antifa how they were set up
[02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:43.440]  how they're how they're how they interact between their cells it's very similar to what we saw in
[02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:52.480]  the late 1960s and early 1970s with the radicalization of the anti-war movement and that spun off a
[02:14:52.480 --> 02:15:00.800]  number of incredibly radical terrorist groups a lot of them were cellular some there was some
[02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:07.280]  interaction between cells and in fact there was some interaction internationally with groups like
[02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:14.880]  the plo and the red army faction in germany the italian red brigades and so forth i think we're
[02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:20.080]  going to see a very similar era here in the united states in the very near future well we
[02:15:20.080 --> 02:15:25.920]  know black lives matter is fashioned after a black lady who's admitted marxists who killed a police
[02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:32.240]  officer who's a hero in cuba today she's a u.s citizen living in cuba and we know that they're
[02:15:32.240 --> 02:15:38.160]  fashion themselves after saula linsky who pledged allegiance to lucifer in his opening book rules
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:41.920]  for radicals we know that they have fashioned themselves after the weathermen and they've
[02:15:41.920 --> 02:15:47.760]  been openly preparing so when you hand out the books you teach it then you say in the media
[02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:52.800]  trump needs to die supporters need to die you're giving direct orders just like al qaeda puts out
[02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:58.800]  videos and says you know go out do this here's the way you do it al qaeda is just as guilty
[02:15:58.800 --> 02:16:04.080]  at the top as they are at the bottom carrying it out it's totally premeditated and they mean
[02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:08.880]  business and they are now showing their force structure they're now showing their force on
[02:16:08.880 --> 02:16:14.720]  the streets they're now coming out of every rat hole for big events and now as i said earlier
[02:16:14.720 --> 02:16:20.400]  you have top democrats coordinating the removal of trump being imminent uh what is your expert
[02:16:20.400 --> 02:16:29.840]  analysis on that well if you look at the uh the event where james hodgkinson shot up the
[02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:36.320]  baseball practice now the congressional baseball practice and where congressman scolese was very
[02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:44.240]  bravely injured and he'll be having a very long recovery from that i think that was just a precursor
[02:16:44.240 --> 02:16:49.520]  of what we're going to see he was a uh in in the tech world he would be called what's what's called
[02:16:49.520 --> 02:16:58.640]  a early adopter and he is kind of a precursor of a whole wave of domestic terrorism you know
[02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:03.200]  primarily be left-wing terrorism although there might be a little bit of right-wing
[02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:14.160]  reactive terrorism it'll be or false flags or false flags yes right um and most of what we're
[02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:20.720]  going to see is going to be cellular so it'll uh it'll be leaderless resistance small cells
[02:17:20.720 --> 02:17:27.520]  motivated politically by the you know the george soros is of the world but because they're independent
[02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:32.000]  cells so they'll be very hard to penetrate by law enforcement and intelligence organizations
[02:17:32.800 --> 02:17:42.240]  and they're going to use off-the-shelf technologies to inflict massive terror on the united states
[02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:50.720]  and with the technologies that exist it will be fairly easy fairly inexpensive and again very
[02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:57.760]  difficult to stop because it'll be a cellular organization and some of those technologies
[02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:05.520]  include things like off-the-shelf quadcopter drones you can go into any hobby store and buy one
[02:18:05.520 --> 02:18:12.080]  and granted they're fairly small but if you use a very compact explosive or if you use a toxin
[02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:20.160]  or as i described in my article a toxin mixed with a transdermal carrier like dmso
[02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:28.640]  all it takes is a very small explosive charge vaporizing a toxin that's been mixed with dmso
[02:18:28.640 --> 02:18:33.920]  and you have dozens of people dead in a 20 30 foot radius well here's the my next point what
[02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:39.200]  does trump what does the american people do as they openly gear up to remove him open openly
[02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:45.440]  gear up from terrorism openly start attacking people and doing stuff what do we do well the best
[02:18:45.440 --> 02:18:53.440]  thing that we can do is still be quite active politically we need to watch out for our own
[02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:58.480]  families and the best thing there is to stay away from public gatherings a large public gatherings
[02:18:58.480 --> 02:19:06.400]  and one of the things that predicted in in this uh two-part article was that i think that
[02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:13.280]  that's the terrorist adoption of some of these technologies is going to make traditional open
[02:19:13.280 --> 02:19:18.480]  air speeches by politicians something of the past they're not going to or even in the even
[02:19:18.480 --> 02:19:23.840]  in a stadium for example they're not going to be able to do that just won't be safe to do
[02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:31.120]  you because in this next wave of terrorism just like the bomb scares and bombings of the late
[02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:38.240]  60s early 70s we're going to see watercopter attacks on so many public gatherings that people
[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:43.200]  simply won't feel safe to be there this is the perfect thing for somebody who doesn't want to
[02:19:43.200 --> 02:19:48.640]  be a suicide bomber to just use a robot to do it we're in the 21st century robots are so expensive
[02:19:48.640 --> 02:19:54.960]  they can easily carry for a $500 drone a four pound package of explosives with nails on the bottom
[02:19:54.960 --> 02:19:59.280]  to kill a few people and create planning or as you said release a chemical weapon and they've
[02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:04.480]  all been gearing up for it will be right back on the other side breaking down the antifa threat

[02:24:19.840 --> 02:24:30.560]  ladies and gentlemen all over the world the global crime syndicate led by people like
[02:24:30.560 --> 02:24:36.080]  george sorrelson started the air of spring killed over a million people funded the ukrainian overthrow
[02:24:36.080 --> 02:24:41.840]  of an elected government and and countless other currency manipulations and other civil wars to
[02:24:41.840 --> 02:24:47.520]  ask why are they so confident because they've done it before but it isn't just donald trump
[02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:53.520]  operating alone patriots in our government in the deep state are battling the other elements of
[02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:59.920]  the deep state there is a civil war in the deep state but the establishment deep state has the msm
[02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:07.200]  but that's a weapon that really backfires on them so now they're running even bigger hoaxes
[02:25:07.200 --> 02:25:11.280]  and attempting to try to get the public back under their control i don't see it happening
[02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:16.560]  so instead they're getting more and more and more hysterical as everything they do fails
[02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:27.120]  and so there is a amplification a spiral a threat continuum acceleration a threat continuum
[02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:33.520]  expansion where the elites believe they're in power they have a normalcy bias of being in power
[02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:38.160]  they have a confirmation bias being around each other but none of them have really ever gotten
[02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:42.400]  their feet wet they're telling the killers to go out and start killing people they're not even
[02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:47.600]  following the orders at this point and so there's a major breakdown in the system is that a good way
[02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:53.680]  to put it james leslie ross we still have our guest
[02:25:56.400 --> 02:26:02.240]  james can you hear me we'll get james leslie ross take on that as soon as we get his phone back on
[02:26:02.240 --> 02:26:09.680]  he was having skype problems and phone problems today at his home now we sit here at the precipice
[02:26:09.680 --> 02:26:15.520]  and we release such bombshells on a daily basis i don't think people understand by the enemy hates
[02:26:15.520 --> 02:26:21.920]  us they know if you ever really start paying attention it's over we broke that obama stole
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:30.640]  90 uh 290 plus billion dollars from fanny may and freddy matt we are putting out and pushing
[02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:36.160]  that cy herch is out there being interviewed and no one else is picking this up saying we know who
[02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:41.360]  the dnc leaguer was it was seth rich and then he gives the evidence this is bombshell information
[02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:47.920]  james leslie ross looking at their escalation look at how they're failing
[02:26:48.800 --> 02:26:54.640]  uh if they keep doubling down i mean it's going to turn into an open hot war where do you see
[02:26:54.640 --> 02:27:02.240]  their hysteria going well i think in the near future we're going to see the wave of terrorism
[02:27:02.240 --> 02:27:09.680]  that i described and uh it may be analogous to what we saw in northern ireland in the 1960s and
[02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:19.360]  70s where you have the um the so-called official side of the ira uh the political side of it was
[02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:27.520]  encapsulated in an organization called synthane and synthane was the the political side they they
[02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:38.640]  actually uh claimed to uh disavow any contact or any control or any cooperation with terrorists
[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:43.120]  that they were all part of the same organization i think we could see the same thing developed
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:51.120]  here in the states with the mainstream antifa movement being political and then you have
[02:27:51.120 --> 02:27:59.440]  dozens of splinter groups which are officially disavowed by the the main portion of antifa
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:04.560]  but they'll they'll be you know conjoined at the hip they'll be all the same people well
[02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:08.320]  they're already burning things and beating people and attacking people and hospitalizing
[02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:12.640]  and calling for everybody's death and clearly it's escalating what is the flashpoint where
[02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:16.240]  it's openly being called terrorism and how bad do you think it'll get what's the timetable
[02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:22.160]  well i i think that with the off the shelf technologies that are that exist and especially
[02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:29.440]  with uh unfortunately the nsa releasing into the wild their hacking tool set
[02:28:30.560 --> 02:28:35.440]  but any of those hacking tools could be used to for an attack on public utilities for example
[02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:44.720]  and we could see an attack on the skater systems uh of the public utilities and that's a terrorist
[02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:49.680]  attack that would affect tens of thousands hundreds of thousands or perhaps even millions
[02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:56.080]  of people all at once james let me ask you this the most likely next next uh progression in the
[02:28:56.080 --> 02:29:02.880]  threat spiral well a lot of other top analysts agree with you and in closing we see in the data
[02:29:03.520 --> 02:29:09.360]  dumps of wiki leaks as of late and and others vault seven of the cia how they're framing
[02:29:09.360 --> 02:29:15.200]  russia and others but russia particularly with cyber attacks run by leftist deep state uh
[02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:20.400]  like reality winner and others that are wild hobbyists back against the united states to blame
[02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:26.720]  russia i'm really concerned about cyber false flags carried out by minions of clapper uh and
[02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:33.120]  others brennan and others to then be blamed on russia as a provocation well yes the the false
[02:29:33.120 --> 02:29:39.200]  flag could point to russia or the false flag could point at american patriots it's just
[02:29:39.200 --> 02:29:43.600]  a matter of who they want to set up they'll be that they'll be convenient patsies that they'll
[02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:49.600]  that they'll be able to set up very easily uh because let's face it it's a it's a purely cyber
[02:29:49.600 --> 02:29:55.600]  environment they can they can point they can create a trail to whatever server they want to
[02:29:55.600 --> 02:30:01.840]  create it's perfect frame of territory thank you james alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:01.840 --> 02:30:09.280]  go our piles lawyers up next james madison the father of the bill of rights wrote where an
[02:30:09.280 --> 02:30:15.360]  excess of power prevails property of no sort is duly respected no man is safe in his opinions
[02:30:15.360 --> 02:30:21.200]  in his person in his faculties or in his possessions is there any question that we have an excess of
[02:30:21.200 --> 02:30:26.320]  power in washington the only question is how do we contain it and how do we remove that power
[02:30:26.320 --> 02:30:32.000]  from washington to our local communities to the individual that is the ultimate concern the
[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:37.680]  concentration of power the excess of power was always the chief concern of the founders of this
[02:30:37.680 --> 02:30:42.160]  country it was why the anti-fiddle is to pose the constitution they believe they put safeguards in
[02:30:42.160 --> 02:30:46.800]  the constitution to abuse that concentration of power but as james madison also pointed out
[02:30:46.800 --> 02:30:51.920]  knowledge will forever govern ignorance of people who mean to be their own governors must
[02:30:51.920 --> 02:30:56.640]  arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives arm yourself with the information of what
[02:30:56.640 --> 02:31:02.160]  your rulers are doing of what the real constraints upon them are only then will you have the courage
[02:31:02.160 --> 02:31:07.440]  to nullify their actions friend for wars dot com i'm david knight alex jones here to tell you

[02:32:15.840 --> 02:32:23.280]  a chance to organize and prepare a defense 60 years ago when foreign air forces were approaching
[02:32:23.280 --> 02:32:30.000]  filled with bombs they had drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century there are
[02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:36.080]  silent weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of plastics
[02:32:36.080 --> 02:32:42.720]  that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death i personally

[02:33:16.240 --> 02:33:32.640]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex joe show
[02:33:46.240 --> 02:33:56.640]  in my life
[02:34:16.720 --> 02:34:25.520]  if you did doing the same thing too well we had another political prisoner on earlier
[02:34:25.520 --> 02:34:31.840]  and asha susan had it up an entire cabinet position for ronald reagan no criminal record he
[02:34:31.840 --> 02:34:37.200]  got five of his friends the political contribution is one of his other friends and they said well
[02:34:37.200 --> 02:34:44.160]  you didn't sign some paperwork so you're gonna spend nine months in prison federal prison well
[02:34:44.160 --> 02:34:48.720]  well now he's put out the big lie exposing a nazi roots the american left he was on earlier
[02:34:48.720 --> 02:34:53.760]  guess who else they want to make a political prisoner former federal agent long-running
[02:34:53.760 --> 02:35:02.160]  sheriff no criminal record sheriff jor pio found guilty of contempt to a judge who's been in the
[02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:09.600]  hip pocket of the democrats this is incredible this is our pio vindicated arresting illegals
[02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:14.320]  that committed felony crimes you name it uh you know arresting illegals that chop people's
[02:35:14.320 --> 02:35:19.600]  heads off i mean he tried to stop the crime that's in mexico from coming here and and and now
[02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:26.320]  george soros bloomberg you name it spent tens of millions to get him removed there out america
[02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:32.400]  county kind of a bellwether of everything but we've now seen and so now they're trying to put
[02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:38.960]  him in jail and make him a political prisoner as well mark goldman is one of the founders
[02:35:38.960 --> 02:35:44.560]  of goldman and zwillinger law firm that focuses on commercial litigation he served as an adjunct
[02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:49.680]  professor of law teaching constitutional law and legal writing also he served as special assistant
[02:35:49.680 --> 02:35:54.400]  county attorney from america county arizona license attorney since 88 mark represents
[02:35:54.400 --> 02:36:04.320]  high-profile clients with expertise in uh public relations gzlawoffice.com is their site and he is
[02:36:04.320 --> 02:36:11.280]  our pio's lawyer here to break down what's been called a kangaroo court a kangaroo uh ruling
[02:36:11.280 --> 02:36:14.800]  and yeah again they're in the news saying i need to be arrested as a russian spy with no evidence
[02:36:14.800 --> 02:36:20.000]  and the president as well so they want to put us all in jail uh what's really going on here mark
[02:36:21.440 --> 02:36:33.120]  oh this is a uh political lynching of a dedicated law enforcement officer who has served his country
[02:36:33.120 --> 02:36:41.200]  and the people of arizona for many years with an impeccable record and it's just a travesty
[02:36:43.600 --> 02:36:48.640]  let's break down the facts because folks want us to go out they want trump to go out his family
[02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:53.040]  and and to go out and fight for our sovereignty and to not let undead radical muslims in
[02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:56.960]  and then once we do it they're trying to kill trump they're trying to remove him from office
[02:36:56.960 --> 02:37:01.120]  they're they're they're trying to put people in prison i mean they come after folks so now is the
[02:37:01.120 --> 02:37:08.640]  time to understand what happened to joe our pio and how we can you know hopefully support him so
[02:37:08.640 --> 02:37:14.160]  lay out we've got some time here exactly what happened to him because i mean i was following
[02:37:14.160 --> 02:37:25.120]  in the news unprecedented actions right this was uh the the timeline leading up to this doesn't lie
[02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:33.360]  and it speaks for itself 11 days before the arizona primary last august
[02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:43.760]  for uh which which included the sheriff's primary race which was contested in the arizona primary
[02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:52.240]  for sheriff where sheriff our pio was running for his seventh or year term in office uh
[02:37:52.240 --> 02:37:58.160]  not a federal judge who had been handling one of the cases in which the sheriff was involved
[02:37:59.680 --> 02:38:06.240]  coincidentally referred the matter for criminal contempt prosecution
[02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:17.680]  to the u.s attorney's office and to the court to the federal court this was again 11 days prior
[02:38:17.680 --> 02:38:28.480]  to the primary election just coincidental of course then yeah then the sheriff won the primary
[02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:38.240]  election and then two weeks to the day prior to the general election in which the sheriff was now
[02:38:38.240 --> 02:38:46.960]  running in the in the primary that's okay it's skype it's live people love the sometimes dogs
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:50.400]  or folks open the door it absolutely happens and just while you're getting that just to
[02:38:50.400 --> 02:38:54.640]  expand on this we've seen the night circuit so you can't have american flags in school
[02:38:55.280 --> 02:38:59.520]  the same night circuit said that he couldn't uh you know control people from places like
[02:38:59.520 --> 02:39:03.840]  somalia and you have other courts ruling the supreme court struck that down that we've seen
[02:39:03.840 --> 02:39:09.760]  incredible judicial tyranny by the democrats the last few years i mean it is frightening
[02:39:09.760 --> 02:39:17.280]  the types of things they do please continue yeah so this matter coincidentally of course
[02:39:18.880 --> 02:39:25.760]  two weeks to the day prior to the general election the court issues its show cause order
[02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:30.880]  ordering to ordering sheriff arpaio to show cause why he should not be held in criminal
[02:39:30.880 --> 02:39:36.880]  contempt of court again coincidentally two days to the day before the the general election
[02:39:36.880 --> 02:39:42.880]  and this matter was pursued by the department of justice under the obama administration the
[02:39:42.880 --> 02:39:49.280]  same folks that meet on tar max with bill clinton exactly the exact same people under the exact same
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:55.280]  attorney general who met with bill clinton in the coincidentally at the phoenix airport
[02:39:57.200 --> 02:40:00.960]  this is the same justice department that congressman steve king and others are saying
[02:40:00.960 --> 02:40:03.760]  need to be criminally investigated for all the things they've done
[02:40:03.760 --> 02:40:12.880]  yes and again this this was this this is the same justice department that clearly initiated this
[02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:23.040]  concurrent with an election which was which to which there had been a huge public outcry
[02:40:23.040 --> 02:40:33.680]  when comey took action and the fba fbi is under the department of justice when he took action
[02:40:33.680 --> 02:40:38.640]  regarding hillary clinton shortly before the presidential election and people were saying
[02:40:38.640 --> 02:40:44.240]  oh that's terrible the justice department has a policy that they will not take this sort of
[02:40:44.240 --> 02:40:50.480]  action prior to an election well gee whiz they took this action right before coincidentally
[02:40:50.480 --> 02:40:59.600]  right before sheriff our pile's general election wow uh let's continue now up to the trial and the
[02:40:59.600 --> 02:41:08.560]  so-called uh you know conviction all the rest of it yeah well we um my law firm stepped into this
[02:41:08.560 --> 02:41:19.280]  case late in the game and we filed several motions pre-trial motions uh every single one of them was
[02:41:19.280 --> 02:41:31.760]  denied uh let's see we also we even filed a motion just to stop the trial for a brief period of time
[02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:38.240]  because it was going to overlap with my only son's bar mitzvah and no dice we couldn't even get
[02:41:38.240 --> 02:41:45.520]  that courtesy from the government or the court uh the the government had the audacity to argue
[02:41:45.520 --> 02:41:52.800]  that it's just a one-day social event so who cares uh in any event we got into the as i said we got
[02:41:52.800 --> 02:42:00.560]  into the game late this was pursued by the very same contrary to fake news and false media reports
[02:42:00.560 --> 02:42:07.360]  this was pursued by the justice department although under sessions by the very same attorneys
[02:42:07.360 --> 02:42:17.600]  that were pursuing it during the obama administration um i sent a letter directly to sessions and
[02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:26.400]  before the trial explaining to him that this case was being brought forward and prosecuted
[02:42:26.400 --> 02:42:35.920]  under the wrong statute which it was and has been and continues to be uh the justice department
[02:42:35.920 --> 02:42:44.400]  used a statute and the court sanctioned it that is inapplicable to the facts of this case and had
[02:42:44.400 --> 02:42:51.280]  they used the correct statute there wouldn't have been a trial because if the that statute provides
[02:42:51.280 --> 02:42:57.040]  for a one-year statute of limitations which had expired and even if the one-year statute of
[02:42:57.040 --> 02:43:10.720]  limitations had arguably not expired that statute provides in un in um unambiguous terms and exact
[02:43:10.720 --> 02:43:19.040]  terms that the sheriff was entitled to a jury trial and needless to say as we all know now
[02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:23.680]  the sheriff was denied a jury trial in this matter that's why i said tell us about the trial
[02:43:23.680 --> 02:43:29.280]  because he wasn't allowed to have one he was given a kangaroo hearing well sure i mean this
[02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:37.600]  this was a criminal referral by one judge in a federal court to another judge in the in the
[02:43:37.600 --> 02:43:45.440]  same federal court it's similar to asking like a victim to try a case to to be the by the way i'm
[02:43:45.440 --> 02:43:50.240]  not a lawyer like you isn't it in the constitution that if if your life's in jeopardy or you're
[02:43:50.240 --> 02:43:57.760]  facing jail time that by law you can demand a jury trial it is however it has been narrowed that has
[02:43:57.760 --> 02:44:07.440]  been narrowed by the supreme court uh certainly by the it has been narrowed and it is not to today
[02:44:07.440 --> 02:44:14.080]  unless the supreme court overrules itself which they should do in that matter so where are we
[02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:18.400]  going here and what can we do for sheriff or pop because he's a champion he could have rolled over
[02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:23.120]  he had the un come after him he got all these lawsuits they tried to destroy him all because
[02:44:23.120 --> 02:44:28.000]  he followed the law 800 plus cities or sanctuary cities where they let criminals you know be deported
[02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:33.280]  20 times rapist murders the media always exaggerates and acts like he was grabbing kids off the street
[02:44:33.280 --> 02:44:38.320]  which he was and he followed the law now they're trying to throw him in jail i mean clearly uh
[02:44:38.320 --> 02:44:44.160]  trump is mad at sessions because sessions is is is intimidated i don't know what's going on
[02:44:44.160 --> 02:44:48.640]  all these crimes are being committed they're trying to bring down trump uh people can say well
[02:44:48.640 --> 02:44:55.040]  trump could you know pardon the uh the uh arpaio but i guess arpaio simply is appealing right now
[02:44:55.040 --> 02:45:02.240]  wanting a jury trial exactly we've appealed we we have a pending petition uh before the
[02:45:02.240 --> 02:45:08.560]  us supreme court and contrary again to the fake news uh which has reported that the petition
[02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:14.080]  was denied by the supreme court it is was never denied by the supreme court and it's still pending
[02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:21.840]  by before the supreme court to this day the only thing that the supreme court denied was our request
[02:45:21.840 --> 02:45:31.280]  for an expedited uh ruling or a stay of the trial the supreme court denied that back in june but it
[02:45:31.280 --> 02:45:35.680]  never denied the petition and it's sitting there right before the supreme court and the supreme
[02:45:35.680 --> 02:45:43.760]  court can take action now tomorrow next week next month reversing this whole matter solely based on
[02:45:43.760 --> 02:45:52.480]  the clear violation of the law where this was brought under the wrong statute and i would
[02:45:52.480 --> 02:45:57.760]  well i mean he doesn't get the appeal what is he facing oh well wait a second let and that's the
[02:45:57.760 --> 02:46:04.080]  supreme court but we also have we'll be appealing this to the ninth circuit the ruling in this case
[02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:08.960]  as well because we there we argue that there are many sure but that's why i raised the ninth circuit
[02:46:08.960 --> 02:46:12.960]  is because i knew that you're you guys are under that that is the you know the most reverse court
[02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:16.880]  out there 80 plus percent of the time i mean i know you don't want to prejudice for him saying
[02:46:16.880 --> 02:46:23.200]  bad things about him but i mean you talk about cuckoo for cocoa puffs right uh the only thing
[02:46:23.200 --> 02:46:29.920]  that i can say about the ninth circuit for the record is that i am uh i am very hopeful that
[02:46:29.920 --> 02:46:36.720]  the ninth circuit will follow the law and it will and if it follows the law then there is nothing
[02:46:36.720 --> 02:46:45.280]  but that the ninth circuit can do except reverse this uh tragic erroneous decision sure but if they
[02:46:45.280 --> 02:46:52.000]  don't what is our pile facing he faces up to six months in prison and at one time discussing this
[02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:56.960]  matter with the head of the public integrity section of the department of justice that's
[02:46:56.960 --> 02:47:02.320]  prosecuting this matter and get this this this is the public integrity section of the department
[02:47:02.320 --> 02:47:10.320]  of justice which is using the wrong statute to prosecute sheriff our pile and they said they want
[02:47:11.040 --> 02:47:16.400]  the full six months and that's what they told me they want to put an eight five year old man
[02:47:16.400 --> 02:47:25.440]  in prison for six months it'll just make you more of a hero i mean they he is so demonized and again
[02:47:25.440 --> 02:47:29.680]  i get demonized he's got there's not many of us in this club they get a lot about and demonized
[02:47:29.680 --> 02:47:35.840]  and misrepresented i mean they've had court rulings and then and then the media says i lost my kids
[02:47:35.840 --> 02:47:42.640]  my children are with me the majority of the time but the media lies so bad they say i'm deeply racist
[02:47:42.640 --> 02:47:48.080]  and then don't show where i'm racist i mean they just and so it just makes me endears me more to
[02:47:48.080 --> 02:47:54.240]  like trump or an arpaio because i'm in the club where you were i mean the media has reached new
[02:47:54.240 --> 02:48:00.480]  lows of lying but you know the good news is only weak minded people believe it and democrat run
[02:48:00.480 --> 02:48:05.760]  federal courts it's it's scary to understand i'm also in the club where they want to put us in jail
[02:48:05.760 --> 02:48:11.280]  now and you know you as a counselor as an officer of the court i know you've studied history what is
[02:48:11.280 --> 02:48:17.840]  it like to see our political climate this dangerous it is really scary and it was scary to read this
[02:48:17.840 --> 02:48:25.280]  opinion and it's scary to see what has gone on with the sheriff arpaio because every citizen
[02:48:25.280 --> 02:48:31.760]  should be concerned about whether a democrat or republican because what if this were a republican
[02:48:31.760 --> 02:48:37.920]  what if that was a republican department of justice that initiated this and it was before
[02:48:37.920 --> 02:48:43.520]  uh trump appointed judges i wouldn't support throwing somebody in jail because because it
[02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:50.480]  it's something like this is crazy right it's an interference by the courts with the executive
[02:48:50.480 --> 02:48:55.200]  branch and the autonomy of the executive branch and the will of the people when they vote in
[02:48:55.920 --> 02:49:02.720]  people because this was done to defeat a candidate that there is no political purposes plus how is
[02:49:04.240 --> 02:49:08.880]  how is a what we should probably matter to you on what happened in the contempt once you tell
[02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:14.320]  folks about that and well i will let let me just opine to one thing before i forget this and just
[02:49:14.320 --> 02:49:21.600]  alex think think about this then think about that a few months ago the fbi said that they don't have
[02:49:21.600 --> 02:49:28.160]  time to monitor all potential terrorists in the united states they don't have enough manpower
[02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:34.800]  but they have enough manpower to pursue an 85-year-old retired sheriff on a witch hunt
[02:49:34.800 --> 02:49:41.840]  and and that's just really tragic and again regardless of your political affiliation
[02:49:41.840 --> 02:49:49.920]  do we really want scarce prosecutorial and law enforcement resources wasting their time on something
[02:49:49.920 --> 02:49:55.200]  but look what that is a tom delay he didn't do anything wrong he was later found you know not
[02:49:55.200 --> 02:50:02.560]  guilty they constantly are on witch hunts trying to put people in prison right because it's a lot
[02:50:02.560 --> 02:50:10.720]  safer for the fbi to go out and interview a bunch of people in connection with what sheriff our

[02:54:23.200 --> 02:54:28.960]  what really happened was scaramucci but what is moving forward that is all coming up with roger
[02:54:28.960 --> 02:54:35.280]  stone who's being sued by barack obama's lawyers claiming with no evidence that he's behind the
[02:54:35.280 --> 02:54:42.480]  russian hacking when we now have cyhurst two-time Pulitzer prize winner saying from his national
[02:54:42.480 --> 02:54:49.440]  intelligence sources the fbi was surveilling seth rich and that it was seth rich leaked it
[02:54:49.440 --> 02:54:56.320]  and that's what wiki leaks have said too this is so big ladies and gentlemen so i know roger has
[02:54:56.320 --> 02:55:00.720]  a guest coming up in the second segment but man sometimes you want to punt on stuff i'm sure
[02:55:00.720 --> 02:55:06.560]  it's a big guess because this is big i want to find out what roger has to say about that but this
[02:55:06.560 --> 02:55:12.000]  is quite a time to be alive ladies and gentlemen quite a time they are coming after everybody
[02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:17.040]  that's why i'm not going to forget our pio now that he's retired driven out by bloomberg and
[02:55:17.040 --> 02:55:21.360]  soros money and they want to put him on prison on top of it to send a message i hope they do this to
[02:55:21.360 --> 02:55:28.080]  me people won't forget me so in closing what do we do to help on this um talking to his lawyer
[02:55:28.080 --> 02:55:37.200]  right now what do we do sir uh to to counter all of this and expanding on that mark goldman
[02:55:37.920 --> 02:55:46.560]  of gzlawoffs.com professors well what do we need to know about this case and the separation of
[02:55:46.560 --> 02:55:57.120]  powers well i think all of us need to let our representatives in washington know that we
[02:55:58.800 --> 02:56:05.760]  that we don't like and we don't want a justice department or justice department officials
[02:56:06.480 --> 02:56:14.160]  interfering with elections whether they're local state or national elections the justice department
[02:56:14.160 --> 02:56:22.000]  needs to stay out of those matters number one on a on the matter pertaining to sheriff arpaio himself
[02:56:23.840 --> 02:56:32.080]  sheriff arpaio just needs and wants everybody's support to know that people do support him that
[02:56:32.080 --> 02:56:40.000]  no one buys into this ruling that he's guilty because the sheriff is a very proud man and the
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:48.720]  sheriff has an enormous amount of integrity he is probably if not the most honest one of the
[02:56:48.720 --> 02:56:54.640]  most honest people i have ever met in my life sure he's definitely an old-timer in that respect
[02:56:54.640 --> 02:56:59.520]  and that's a good thing just briefly for folks explain what happened with the so-called contempt
[02:56:59.520 --> 02:57:04.560]  he he's the judge judge jury executioner the judge dread has found him guilty of
[02:57:04.560 --> 02:57:16.400]  yeah well now he's the judge in her ruling set a date in october for his sentencing
[02:57:17.200 --> 02:57:23.760]  why in october we have no idea we're going to ask her to move that up the sheriff's 85 years old
[02:57:23.760 --> 02:57:27.360]  and he certainly wants some finality well let me tell you they're planning a coup against
[02:57:27.360 --> 02:57:34.960]  trump it's been announced well yeah the you know this this just will not end they're not
[02:57:34.960 --> 02:57:40.400]  they don't want to leave them alone they want to they want to well that sounds insane brennan
[02:57:40.400 --> 02:57:48.720]  said they're going to have a coup on tv last week oh yeah they if this if that type of rhetoric
[02:57:48.720 --> 02:57:55.920]  had been used against any other president and especially barack obama there would be rioting
[02:57:55.920 --> 02:58:04.880]  in the street but somehow the people who don't like trump feel that they are entitled to essentially
[02:58:04.880 --> 02:58:12.160]  overthrow the government of the united states it's it's it's shocking it's incredible i mean
[02:58:12.160 --> 02:58:17.520]  specifically though we only have 45 seconds tell them how they found him in contempt oh she found
[02:58:17.520 --> 02:58:24.000]  it in contempt there there are three elements the order must be clear and definite the defendant
[02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:31.360]  must have notice and understanding of the order and he must willfully disobey it what was he
[02:58:31.360 --> 02:58:39.280]  disobeying supposedly a a preliminary injunction order by a judge in another court which was anything
[02:58:39.280 --> 02:58:43.600]  but clear and definite that was never proved in the case sure absolutely so he was just he said
[02:58:43.600 --> 02:58:47.520]  i'm gonna do my job and arrest the legals shall they so they're trying to put him in prison uh
[02:58:47.520 --> 02:58:51.920]  it's incredible all right thank you so much uh mark for that we're gonna be right back with the

[03:05:31.200 --> 03:05:36.480]  brilliance of metaphor to tell you all that they mean the unbelievers will say they are but words
[03:05:36.480 --> 03:05:42.400]  but a slogan but a flamboyant phrase every demagogue every cynic every hypocrite every
[03:05:42.400 --> 03:05:47.520]  troublemaker and i am sorry to say some others of an entirely different character will try to
[03:05:47.520 --> 03:05:52.800]  downgrade them even to the extent of mockery and ridicule but these are some of the things they do
[03:05:52.800 --> 03:05:58.320]  they build your basic character they mold you for the future roles as a custodian of the nation's

[03:09:50.800 --> 03:10:00.720]  him according to cy hearse's fbi nsa sources high level that he's had for a decade that ladies and
[03:10:00.720 --> 03:10:07.680]  gentlemen it was seth rich he's been in contact not just with the fbi but with julien assange
[03:10:07.680 --> 03:10:13.520]  well julien assange already told us when seth rich got killed back in july he said look he was our
[03:10:13.520 --> 03:10:17.840]  source we can't officially say it we never give out sources but you can believe it should be
[03:10:17.840 --> 03:10:24.640]  investigated so we have julien assange we have cy hearse we have just absolute evidence and that's
[03:10:24.640 --> 03:10:30.400]  why they're so scared and why they don't want any discussion of the seth rich murder they act like
[03:10:30.400 --> 03:10:36.320]  the guy never existed now now we've got exciting races against democrats around the country and
[03:10:36.320 --> 03:10:40.400]  against neocons and roger showed us a special guest that he's about to bring up right now and
[03:10:40.400 --> 03:10:44.160]  we're going to skip the next break so roger gets this time back but uh roger i know you're
[03:10:44.160 --> 03:10:47.920]  going to break this down after your next guest leaves us this this is amazing
[03:10:49.600 --> 03:10:52.960]  sorry uh alexi means seymour hersh new york times
[03:10:52.960 --> 03:10:58.960]  Pulitzer prize winner one of the most respected investigative reporters in the country now
[03:10:58.960 --> 03:11:06.720]  reveals to us that not only was seth rich the most likely source of the wiki leaks documents
[03:11:06.720 --> 03:11:12.320]  last week william bennie and others came forward to say that they they have technical evidence
[03:11:12.320 --> 03:11:16.640]  that most of the material from the democratic national committee was not hacked at all
[03:11:16.640 --> 03:11:24.000]  but downloaded loaded to thumb drives spirited out of the building by rich most likely sold
[03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:30.400]  by the way but uh we also know um that uh that a british diplomat came forward and
[03:11:30.400 --> 03:11:37.040]  claimed that he was essentially the mule that took those things uh to julien assange so the entire
[03:11:37.040 --> 03:11:45.200]  russian hacking meme or narrative is put together by john pedesta and the democrats is collapsing
[03:11:45.200 --> 03:11:51.840]  before your very eyes and then of course you have the relationship of the awan brothers
[03:11:51.840 --> 03:11:56.000]  and where they fit into this we're going to be getting into all of that and more
[03:11:56.000 --> 03:12:03.280]  right here at info wars uh i do want to point out that one of the opportunities in my opinion
[03:12:03.280 --> 03:12:11.200]  through the failure of the health care effort last week is that president trump may now realize
[03:12:11.200 --> 03:12:19.200]  that the establishment republicans are not really for him and that uh voters could really
[03:12:19.200 --> 03:12:24.320]  make a difference the president has a unique opportunity to sort the republican establishment
[03:12:24.320 --> 03:12:30.000]  and go into these states and districts districts take on incumbent republicans who are not with
[03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:36.080]  the program not only clean up the republican party return it to being a party of nationalism
[03:12:36.080 --> 03:12:43.120]  in the middle class but also uh sparking fear in the hearts of the establishment republicans
[03:12:43.120 --> 03:12:51.760]  who are backstabbing him on health care uh joining me now is uh general um mike pardon me
[03:12:51.760 --> 03:12:56.720]  colonel mike mccallister of my home state of florida a decorated war hero but more importantly
[03:12:56.720 --> 03:13:03.360]  the spokesman for citizens for trump now citizens for trump is the grassroots organization from where
[03:13:03.360 --> 03:13:11.040]  mike cernovich jack sobiak and others uh come from this is the these are the marching troops
[03:13:11.040 --> 03:13:17.200]  these are the front lines of the trump revolution uh colonel mccallister thanks for joining us
[03:13:18.160 --> 03:13:24.640]  hey it's great to be on today roger uh you made a trip recently to alabama and i want to talk about
[03:13:24.640 --> 03:13:30.880]  that because this is a classic case of where a fear could be struck in the hearts of the republican
[03:13:30.880 --> 03:13:37.760]  establishment uh the appointed u.s senator looser strange a former attorney general has the support
[03:13:37.760 --> 03:13:44.880]  of mitch mccall and the republican establishment he is awash in special interest money they have
[03:13:44.880 --> 03:13:51.040]  managed to postpone several inquiries into unethical activity including taking a bribe
[03:13:51.040 --> 03:13:58.160]  to look the other way on a major uh environmental issue in his state using attorney general campaign
[03:13:58.160 --> 03:14:04.320]  money uh for uh the u.s senate race we're going to postpone that all till after the election folks
[03:14:04.320 --> 03:14:10.960]  so colonel tell us why you went to alabama and and tell us the situation well i was up there last
[03:14:10.960 --> 03:14:18.160]  week in fact i uh communicate with that with the campaign again today i was up there um i guess two
[03:14:18.160 --> 03:14:25.280]  weeks ago for most of the week and obviously what we have is a special election uh it's the primary
[03:14:25.920 --> 03:14:31.280]  to replace the seat that was held by the new attorney general jeff session and it is going
[03:14:31.280 --> 03:14:38.480]  to be a critical critical decision for alabama and you're right he's running against an appointed
[03:14:38.480 --> 03:14:46.240]  incumbent that named looser strange and looser was the former ag who was investigating the governor
[03:14:46.240 --> 03:14:53.280]  and then the governor appointed him to take the vacancy so they now are having this special
[03:14:53.280 --> 03:14:58.560]  election but there's a lot going on there a lot on the ground just like you touched on you also
[03:14:58.560 --> 03:15:03.520]  have obrux who's a sitting u.s congressman and he's in that race never trump and you have this
[03:15:04.080 --> 03:15:09.600]  they're never trump ever trump or and you have a former chief justice of the uh alabama supreme
[03:15:09.600 --> 03:15:15.200]  court ray morphe's in that race and then you have dr randy brinston who's really the true
[03:15:15.200 --> 03:15:22.480]  outsider and conservative and is pro trump and wants to help the president achieve his agenda
[03:15:22.480 --> 03:15:29.360]  to make america great again and he's also a physician and they uh the lay minister yeah and
[03:15:29.360 --> 03:15:34.720]  i want to make one thing very clear no one here at info wars not roger stone not colonel mccallister
[03:15:34.720 --> 03:15:41.760]  no one at info wars has any financial or or consulting or business relationship i'm supporting
[03:15:41.760 --> 03:15:48.640]  randy brinston because he supported donald trump because he was with trump early and because i want
[03:15:48.640 --> 03:15:56.000]  to strike fear in the heart of mitch mcconnell these establishment republicans these rhinos
[03:15:56.880 --> 03:16:03.200]  must know that you can't cross donald trump with impunity that there is some consequence now
[03:16:03.200 --> 03:16:08.400]  colonel mccallister i know a lot of my friends here in florida would like to see you run for public
[03:16:08.400 --> 03:16:14.080]  office i know you looked at the i guess the u.s senate and then when senator marco rubio
[03:16:14.080 --> 03:16:21.920]  reversed himself decided not to retire he pulled back but uh what's on your horizon well actually
[03:16:21.920 --> 03:16:27.040]  i ran in the senate primary and lost to connie mac and then he lost to bill nelson that's what um
[03:16:27.040 --> 03:16:33.520]  you know right now what we're doing is we're trying to reach out and support pro trump candidate
[03:16:33.520 --> 03:16:40.480]  you know i am the national spokesman for citizens for trump we're involved in this senate race in
[03:16:40.480 --> 03:16:46.000]  alabama we're going to be looking at some governor races maybe key congressional races so right now
[03:16:46.000 --> 03:16:51.040]  focused on that but i will say this roger you know having run for governor i lost to rick scott
[03:16:51.040 --> 03:16:57.760]  having run for us senate uh i am always open though and willing to step up anytime i have a
[03:16:57.760 --> 03:17:03.920]  chance to serve this great state of florida and this great nation so i'm keeping all those options
[03:17:03.920 --> 03:17:09.600]  open right now we're focused on trying to get people in office that can support the president
[03:17:10.160 --> 03:17:16.240]  and help them move america forward and get the swamp right well as you know abraham lincoln lost a
[03:17:16.240 --> 03:17:21.520]  house race and a senate race uh back to back before going to the white house so i'm delighted to hear
[03:17:21.520 --> 03:17:28.320]  that you're not encouraged we need good men uh and women like you who are not globalists who are
[03:17:28.320 --> 03:17:33.680]  not afraid of the republican establishment oh insurer here at info wars helped us identify
[03:17:33.680 --> 03:17:39.760]  omar navarro who i think is one of the most promising young reform candidates out there
[03:17:40.480 --> 03:17:45.280]  and one of the things i want to do here at info wars is to spotlight patriots who are running
[03:17:45.280 --> 03:17:51.920]  patriots who are down with the trump reform agenda patriots who are unafraid to call out
[03:17:51.920 --> 03:17:57.680]  islamic terrorism when they see it patriots who will stand up for a strong national defense
[03:17:57.680 --> 03:18:06.640]  but to turn away from this neocon foreign policy of going around the globe looking for trouble
[03:18:07.520 --> 03:18:13.200]  are there now are there any other races that you want to mention here before we move on because
[03:18:13.200 --> 03:18:19.520]  it's such a fast news breaking day you've got developments on the awan brothers uh and the
[03:18:19.520 --> 03:18:25.520]  sath riche murder uh you have an analysis coming up of the new trump white house and what's going
[03:18:25.520 --> 03:18:31.520]  on there so carol mccalister you've got the floor here for a minute tell us what else you you see on
[03:18:31.520 --> 03:18:38.880]  the horizon well i think that 2018 and i think you would agree roger is going to be a pivotal year
[03:18:38.880 --> 03:18:46.720]  here and the democrats are obviously looking at how to rebound and how to regain a base
[03:18:46.720 --> 03:18:52.800]  and use it as a launch pad for 2020 and living right here in florida like you and i both too
[03:18:52.800 --> 03:18:59.040]  it's the biggest swing state in the nation has 29 electoral votes and we have a full plate of
[03:18:59.040 --> 03:19:05.200]  elections in 2018 we have the u.s senate race to replace bill nelson which is going to be a high
[03:19:05.200 --> 03:19:12.240]  priority all 27 of us congress races will again be up for reelection but we're also going to have
[03:19:12.240 --> 03:19:17.920]  a governor and the entire governor's cabinet in florida will be up for reelection in 2018
[03:19:18.480 --> 03:19:24.640]  so i'm pretty sure the democrats are aware of that and they're probably looking at if we could
[03:19:24.640 --> 03:19:31.920]  seize momentum in a key swing state like florida it could give us a launch pad for 2020 to try to
[03:19:31.920 --> 03:19:37.840]  take the white house back so i look for them to have a big effort and a big emphasis and focus on
[03:19:37.840 --> 03:19:44.400]  florida in 2018 to keep bill nelson in office and regain the governor's mansion and use those
[03:19:44.400 --> 03:19:51.920]  as a launch pad to regain the white house in 2020 well well said you know folks if you're not a
[03:19:51.920 --> 03:19:57.200]  member of citizens for trump go online and sign up this is one of the greatest most vibrant most
[03:19:57.200 --> 03:20:03.680]  robust grassroots organizations didn't cost you anything to join but they will tell tell you
[03:20:03.680 --> 03:20:09.200]  where the hot spots are in the country this is where my friends mike uh cernovich and jack
[03:20:09.200 --> 03:20:16.800]  sobiak came from uh this is the wellspring of those who couldn't get a response from the trump
[03:20:16.800 --> 03:20:23.520]  campaign so they went out and they built their own grassroots organization uh and uh it is uh it is
[03:20:23.520 --> 03:20:28.000]  a great group folks i'm going to be speaking to them on the 12th and atlanta uh if you're not a
[03:20:28.000 --> 03:20:33.520]  member i urge you to sign up and follow their activities uh we are fully supportive here of
[03:20:33.520 --> 03:20:41.120]  citizens for trump colonel thank you for joining us and god bless america and thank you for your
[03:20:41.120 --> 03:20:47.520]  service to our country thanks for having me on roger i'd be pleased to be back with your program
[03:20:47.520 --> 03:20:55.600]  anytime many many thanks let us uh move on now because uh i've never seen a news cycle like this
[03:20:55.600 --> 03:21:01.520]  where there's so much breaking it's impossible for us here at info wars to keep up with the
[03:21:01.520 --> 03:21:08.080]  developments as alex jones said in the opening the media seems to have completely elevated this
[03:21:08.080 --> 03:21:16.080]  phony story about donald trump uh you know trying to manage fallout from the bogus story about his
[03:21:16.080 --> 03:21:21.840]  son's meeting with a russian lawyer uh who seems to have been let into the country by the fbi
[03:21:21.840 --> 03:21:31.040]  despite any uh a presence of a visa uh and who now has been tied directly to fusing gps uh and
[03:21:31.040 --> 03:21:36.640]  photos of her that we've obtained here at info wars at hillary clinton uh demonstrations photos
[03:21:36.640 --> 03:21:44.320]  of the woman lawyer and senator john mccain's office the the words set up look pretty apparent
[03:21:44.320 --> 03:21:50.960]  to me this smells more and more like a set up but let's be absolutely clear there's nothing
[03:21:50.960 --> 03:21:58.080]  illegal nor improper with donald trump jr or the leadership of the trump campaign meeting with a
[03:21:58.080 --> 03:22:05.200]  person who comes forward to claims that they have documented evidence of wrongdoing no evidence
[03:22:05.200 --> 03:22:14.480]  existed i was on a panel at politicon with jill wine volner the former watergate special prosecutor uh
[03:22:14.480 --> 03:22:21.120]  a very uh learned and attractive and i would say articulate woman but her claim that there was a
[03:22:21.120 --> 03:22:30.240]  campaign violation that there was um something of a value was given to trump jr and therefore
[03:22:30.240 --> 03:22:37.120]  there was a violation of the law is a bogus argument nothing whatsoever was given donald trump
[03:22:37.120 --> 03:22:44.080]  jr was targeted because he's a follower of info wars donald trump jr is one who often retweets
[03:22:44.080 --> 03:22:50.560]  some of the better stories here produced by uh by alex jones and the crew at info wars he's
[03:22:50.560 --> 03:22:57.760]  a patriot he's not afraid to support and defend his father and that's why they have targeted him
[03:22:57.760 --> 03:23:05.440]  not because he has done anything whatsoever that is improper but they elevate that story at the same
[03:23:05.440 --> 03:23:12.240]  time we choose to ignore politzer prize-winning author site seymour hirsch formally of the new
[03:23:12.240 --> 03:23:19.840]  york times where he won a politzer for the mylai story of vietnam uh which related of course to
[03:23:19.840 --> 03:23:29.200]  uh murders by the u.s. military uh he believes hirsch this is that not only was rich's murder
[03:23:29.200 --> 03:23:38.800]  not a robbery gone wrong but that rich was the source for wiki leaks that he was loading material
[03:23:38.800 --> 03:23:48.960]  to a dropbox where uh where uh wiki leaks and perhaps others got access uh additionally uh he says
[03:23:49.600 --> 03:23:56.320]  that um along with william benny and others there is now extraordinary evidence that there was
[03:23:56.320 --> 03:24:05.440]  minimal perhaps no hacking whatsoever of the dnc that the data was mostly downloaded from a to a
[03:24:05.440 --> 03:24:14.400]  thumb drive uh and passed on uh through intermediaries uh or put up on a dropbox where wiki leaks
[03:24:14.400 --> 03:24:22.640]  was able to obtain it now as you know julien assange it it within the keeping of most journalists
[03:24:22.640 --> 03:24:30.400]  i know is not in a position to disclose his sources but when he offered a 25 000 reward
[03:24:30.400 --> 03:24:35.920]  for information leading to the murder of seth rich to me that was a pretty clear indicator
[03:24:36.800 --> 03:24:43.280]  that uh rich was in fact one of his sources additionally you'll notice that wiki leaks
[03:24:43.280 --> 03:24:52.880]  often put uh relinks other third party stories that say that rich was the source julien assange
[03:24:52.880 --> 03:25:00.800]  is a very clever man he's a journalist and no folks he does not work for the russians the question
[03:25:00.800 --> 03:25:09.520]  of rich's murder um well uh it is believed by her that john brennan the islamist convert who
[03:25:09.520 --> 03:25:18.240]  served as cia director under barack obama and george w bush was behind this entire operation
[03:25:18.240 --> 03:25:25.600]  both the operation to steal the data and blame it on russia we also know that there there is an
[03:25:25.600 --> 03:25:32.720]  enormous mixing of apples and oranges as far as the emails from the dnc is concerned there is no
[03:25:32.720 --> 03:25:40.800]  evidence that that information was hacked and stolen uh what was put online by gucifer 2.0
[03:25:40.800 --> 03:25:48.480]  who may not even be a romanian never mind a russian because his software actually traces to an
[03:25:48.480 --> 03:25:56.560]  individual who worked at the dnc and what he uncovered was donald trump opposition research
[03:25:57.280 --> 03:26:04.560]  so in other words he gave wiki leaks or someone gave wiki leaks negative information about donald
[03:26:04.560 --> 03:26:11.920]  trump but the taggings the markings of that which are indisputable don't track back to uh
[03:26:11.920 --> 03:26:19.360]  uh gucifer 2.0 they track back to a fellow named uh wafford i believe it is uh who worked at the
[03:26:19.360 --> 03:26:30.000]  democratic national committee the the uh the thick plotons as they say and now you have the question
[03:26:30.000 --> 03:26:36.080]  of the awan brothers what to make of this you've read about the awan brothers these are the two
[03:26:36.080 --> 03:26:45.040]  pakistanis who came first to work for debora waserman schultz every man's first wife uh and
[03:26:45.040 --> 03:26:50.400]  the former head of the democratic national committee who was forced to resign when it was
[03:26:50.400 --> 03:26:58.000]  revealed that she and hillary had cheated poor bernie sanders in order to win the democratic
[03:26:58.000 --> 03:27:04.880]  nomination by the way primary votes in california between hillary clinton and bernie sanders
[03:27:04.880 --> 03:27:11.520]  still not counted the count goes on unbelievably donald trump is president the election has been
[03:27:11.520 --> 03:27:17.200]  over six months but officials in the california democratic party can't count all the primary
[03:27:17.200 --> 03:27:23.200]  ballots out there in the golden state you know why because hillary clinton lost that's why and
[03:27:23.200 --> 03:27:29.200]  because the shift of those delegates would move the nomination to bernie sanders so um that's why
[03:27:29.200 --> 03:27:36.400]  you have a cover-up going on there uh i would say that the awan brother problems for debora waserman
[03:27:36.400 --> 03:27:43.600]  schultz are just beginning the two brothers worked for over 30 individual members of congress
[03:27:43.600 --> 03:27:49.520]  performing sensitive it tasks that gave him access to top secret and classified information
[03:27:49.520 --> 03:27:55.520]  the extensive list of financial and legal red flags would have prohibited any person
[03:27:55.520 --> 03:28:00.400]  for being denied a security clearance but debora waserman schultz did the unthinkable
[03:28:01.040 --> 03:28:08.080]  when the capitol hill police made it clear to her that they had launched an investigation over theft
[03:28:08.080 --> 03:28:14.720]  from the computer system of the u.s. house of representatives waserman schultz actually
[03:28:14.720 --> 03:28:23.440]  changed the classification of the awan brothers from consultants to employees that way he and
[03:28:23.440 --> 03:28:29.760]  she ensured that they would continue to have access to the house of representative computers
[03:28:29.760 --> 03:28:36.880]  despite the fact that they were under investigation i think that that is in itself collusion
[03:28:37.600 --> 03:28:43.360]  with a couple of felons the assistant u.s. attorney who's overseeing the awan family
[03:28:43.360 --> 03:28:53.040]  investigation is steven waserman sound familiar why he's the brother of congresswoman waserman schultz
[03:28:54.640 --> 03:28:59.520]  it also appears that the awan hard drives that were given to almost 20 pieces equipment were
[03:28:59.520 --> 03:29:06.320]  turned over to the capitol hill police and the fbi were damaged and in some cases uh not intact
[03:29:06.320 --> 03:29:15.680]  so the idea that they are being blackmailed and that is why no democratic national congressional
[03:29:15.680 --> 03:29:23.360]  member will come forward to testify smells like blackmail to me folks it's a good time to remind
[03:29:23.360 --> 03:29:31.520]  you that we here at info wars are the tip of the spear but we cannot survive and we cannot defeat
[03:29:31.520 --> 03:29:38.240]  the extraordinary efforts uh to censor us without your support so i urge you to go to
[03:29:38.240 --> 03:29:44.640]  the info wars dot com store where we have some unbelievable late july specials super

[03:30:06.320 --> 03:30:11.200]  the constitutional convention 1787 was held strict secrecy and at the end of the proceeding
[03:30:11.200 --> 03:30:15.520]  citizens gathered outside independence hall to learn what had been produced behind closed doors
[03:30:15.520 --> 03:30:19.840]  while benjamin franklin was leaving the hall a lady asked him well doctor what have we got a
[03:30:19.840 --> 03:30:25.360]  republic or a monarchy to which he responded a republic if you can keep it but today not only
[03:30:25.360 --> 03:30:29.760]  have we lost a republic but most people don't even know what a republic even is for one thing a
[03:30:29.760 --> 03:30:34.560]  republic is not a democracy the republic operates under the rule law which protects individual
[03:30:34.560 --> 03:30:38.640]  liberties so that the majority cannot take away the rights of the minority under a public the
[03:30:38.640 --> 03:30:43.280]  government and its citizens all by by the same laws regardless of political power or lack thereof
[03:30:43.280 --> 03:30:47.680]  democracy on the other hand only leads the mob rule fueled by the unrestrained whims of the public
[03:30:47.680 --> 03:30:51.920]  in a democracy the individual or any groups of individuals composing the minority have no
[03:30:51.920 --> 03:30:56.400]  protection against the unlimited power of the majority it is a case of majority over man in
[03:30:56.400 --> 03:31:00.720]  other words under democracy two wolves can vote to eat the sheep for dinner but under a republic
[03:31:00.720 --> 03:31:05.920]  the sheep's right to life is protected by the rule of law this is kit daniels with dimplewars.com

[03:32:18.560 --> 03:32:24.160]  our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do today and our ancient
[03:32:24.160 --> 03:32:30.160]  ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting killing and then processing and
[03:32:30.160 --> 03:32:36.960]  so i set out to develop caveman but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken but seven

[03:36:23.280 --> 03:36:31.520]  list so moving on uh let's go back to the awan brothers because this is the story uh that the
[03:36:31.520 --> 03:36:40.080]  mainstream media refuses to put on page one there are allegations of course that the awans
[03:36:41.040 --> 03:36:48.000]  new south rich they may have in fact based on what sources tell me have partied with south rich
[03:36:48.000 --> 03:36:57.040]  there's so many missing uh time frames uh in terms of the night before we know the dc metropolitan
[03:36:57.040 --> 03:37:04.400]  police has made no effort to get the uh video surveillance camera footage from the last bar
[03:37:05.040 --> 03:37:13.120]  that seth was in they made no effort to question the people who worked there the bartender and so on
[03:37:13.760 --> 03:37:20.880]  uh a blockbuster story by dr jerry coursey here on info wars last week shows how they purposely
[03:37:20.880 --> 03:37:28.480]  changed the time of the report of a break in into a car in which a gun owned by the fbi was stolen
[03:37:28.480 --> 03:37:35.360]  to try to give the impression that there was some connection to the seth rich murder that's the kind
[03:37:35.360 --> 03:37:40.000]  of investigative reporting that you see here at info wars folks but you're not going to see
[03:37:40.000 --> 03:37:49.360]  at the new york times or the washington post so um why have the new york times the washington post
[03:37:49.360 --> 03:37:56.160]  and first and foremost the fort loader dale sun sentinel the major paper in deborah waserman
[03:37:56.160 --> 03:38:05.920]  schultz's district given this story such scant coverage what is it they are covering up as i
[03:38:05.920 --> 03:38:11.440]  think you probably have heard one of the awan brothers uh attempted to flee the country last
[03:38:11.440 --> 03:38:20.560]  week was actually pulled off of a uh a jetliner at dullis airport in washington dc by the fbi
[03:38:20.560 --> 03:38:28.880]  seeking to leave the country after wiring uh at least 300 thousand dollars there are indications
[03:38:28.880 --> 03:38:35.280]  that he may have sent as much as two million dollars on to pakistan where it appears the rest
[03:38:35.280 --> 03:38:41.120]  of his family fled here's the other interesting point that many in the mainstream media who are
[03:38:41.120 --> 03:38:48.000]  covering the story have missed there's no evidence that the awan brothers were it geniuses they have
[03:38:48.000 --> 03:38:54.560]  no extensive previous it experience that would indicate that they have the kind of capabilities
[03:38:54.560 --> 03:39:02.640]  that they were even selling on capitol hill was this a pakistani intelligence operation it looks to
[03:39:02.640 --> 03:39:10.160]  me like the awan brothers were getting technical help from someone but just as it is the story
[03:39:10.160 --> 03:39:17.120]  still donald trump jr russian collusion nobody wants to talk about the awan brothers their
[03:39:17.840 --> 03:39:25.200]  alleged connection to seth riche in ongoing developments in the seth riche murder case
[03:39:26.560 --> 03:39:34.880]  last week the atlantic a left-wing magazine posted a uh an open letter from a sandy hook
[03:39:34.880 --> 03:39:42.560]  mother attacking me for simply saying on my twitter feed does anyone but me find it odd
[03:39:43.440 --> 03:39:47.440]  that seth riche's parents seem to have no interest in who killed their son
[03:39:48.800 --> 03:39:57.440]  that's not over the top that's not obnoxious or rude that's common sense yes of course the
[03:39:57.440 --> 03:40:06.960]  privacy of seth riche's parents is important but the truth is more important and the mainstream
[03:40:06.960 --> 03:40:13.840]  media effort to cover up the truth in this matter well that's why alex jones said only yesterday
[03:40:13.840 --> 03:40:22.080]  this case needs investigation the american people need to know i'm looking forward to the opportunity
[03:40:22.080 --> 03:40:28.240]  to testify before the house and senate intelligence committees because they operate from the get go
[03:40:28.240 --> 03:40:37.120]  on the false premise that the russians hacked the dnc's email server i don't believe that's true
[03:40:37.120 --> 03:40:45.200]  in fact i can think i can prove to the senate and the house that it is false see they operate on a
[03:40:45.200 --> 03:40:53.440]  set premise and the mummy dummies in the 17 intelligence agencies endlessly repeat this
[03:40:53.440 --> 03:40:59.200]  narrative line almost like they got a talking point memo we've ascertained that the russians
[03:41:00.720 --> 03:41:08.480]  hacked the dnc and that they interfered in the election but they put forward no proof whatsoever
[03:41:08.480 --> 03:41:20.080]  that would stand up in a us court of law none whatsoever i also want to report on you to you
[03:41:20.080 --> 03:41:29.520]  on a very exciting trip i took to los angeles to stand with omar navarro the republican candidate
[03:41:29.520 --> 03:41:38.640]  for congress in the 43rd district uh facing mad maxine waters now in the uh in the nature of
[03:41:38.640 --> 03:41:46.560]  full disclosure i want to say that i am a strategic consultant to his campaign being paid the princely
[03:41:46.560 --> 03:41:54.640]  sum of one dollar uh and i'm going to be uh watching this race because i think it is a
[03:41:54.640 --> 03:42:03.440]  template for the future i give credit to owin shoyer as the journalist who first identified
[03:42:03.440 --> 03:42:10.720]  this as a key race and identified omar navarro as a hard charger i can't tell you how i am
[03:42:10.720 --> 03:42:18.720]  how impressed i am with this young man and this race is not about left and right it's not about
[03:42:18.720 --> 03:42:25.040]  globalists and nationalists it's not about liberal and conservative it's not about republican and
[03:42:25.040 --> 03:42:32.560]  democrat it's about corruption and integrity and government you see maxine waters is among
[03:42:32.560 --> 03:42:39.680]  the most corrupt members of congress maxine waters uh put pressure on the u.s government
[03:42:39.680 --> 03:42:47.280]  to bail out a failing bank but never disclosed that she and her husband owned stock in that bank
[03:42:47.280 --> 03:42:54.800]  and that her husband was on the board of directors maxine waters congressional committee has paid
[03:42:54.800 --> 03:43:03.840]  her daughter six hundred thousand dollars for what her tough reelection campaigns she hasn't
[03:43:03.840 --> 03:43:10.880]  had a race in years and then they have what they call the slate scam let me explain that to you
[03:43:10.880 --> 03:43:18.960]  this is where maxine waters and her and her posse create slate cards that look almost identical
[03:43:18.960 --> 03:43:26.000]  to the official slate card put forward by the democratic central committee in the counties
[03:43:26.000 --> 03:43:34.240]  where she serves only this is the maxine waters slate and if you're a down ballot democrat running
[03:43:34.240 --> 03:43:40.400]  for the assembly or the county commission or the city council well you got to pay up and you can
[03:43:40.400 --> 03:43:48.880]  and you've got to pay up big to get on the slate card it's a scam folks she's using her position
[03:43:48.880 --> 03:43:57.920]  to make money uh the irony of this is that maxine waters lives uh in a multi-million dollar mansion
[03:43:58.800 --> 03:44:08.800]  outside the district she lives in the very affluent handcock park she is eating filet mignon
[03:44:08.800 --> 03:44:17.280]  on while her constituents can barely afford carne asada this is among the poorest most
[03:44:17.280 --> 03:44:25.680]  destitute districts in the country the schools are terrible they're like prisons the streets
[03:44:25.680 --> 03:44:32.160]  and neighborhoods are unsafe you take your life in your hands to go to some parts of this district

[03:54:22.240 --> 03:54:34.400]  welcome back i'm roger stone here at info wars sitting in for my good friend alex jones
[03:54:35.840 --> 03:54:41.600]  i want to start a new thing here we're going to call a bad guy of the week and we're going to try
[03:54:42.160 --> 03:54:48.800]  in each segment to identify an individual currently in government who needs to go
[03:54:48.800 --> 03:54:56.640]  though in this case i have in mind acting fbi director indrew mccabe currently serving as the
[03:54:56.640 --> 03:55:03.760]  acting director of the fbi or i guess now that mr ray has been confirmed only yesterday serving as
[03:55:03.760 --> 03:55:11.920]  the number two man at the fbi this fellow has a number of actions of malfeasance and conflicts
[03:55:11.920 --> 03:55:18.240]  of interest that are most troubling first of all it is mr mccabe will authorize the spending of
[03:55:18.240 --> 03:55:30.960]  fifty thousand dollars of our tax money to pay for the phony dossier that was created in europe
[03:55:30.960 --> 03:55:39.120]  and brought to our fbi for the purposes of smearing the president based on completely false
[03:55:39.120 --> 03:55:48.960]  allegations uh... that he uh... engaged a group of prostitutes to urinate on a bed in a muskow hotel
[03:55:48.960 --> 03:55:58.880]  room uh... for some period or uh... i guess sexual reason this whole story is a lie a manufactured
[03:55:58.880 --> 03:56:08.320]  fairytale we now know that the fusion gps was involved but what uh... what convinced mr mccabe
[03:56:08.320 --> 03:56:15.440]  that we would want to spend fifty thousand dollars of our tax dollars trying to forward this phony
[03:56:15.440 --> 03:56:22.720]  dossier he also didn't bother to report that his wife who was running for the state senate got a
[03:56:22.720 --> 03:56:32.720]  six hundred and seventy five thousand dollar uh... uh... uh... infusion of cash from terry mccall if the
[03:56:32.720 --> 03:56:39.680]  democrat governor of virginia uh... the finance chairman for both bill and hillary's previous
[03:56:39.680 --> 03:56:46.960]  presidential campaigns uh... and a fellow who knows how to move money around this uh... at the
[03:56:46.960 --> 03:56:53.680]  uh... at the exact time mccabe was supposed to be investigating hillary clinton sure smells like a
[03:56:53.680 --> 03:57:01.760]  payoff to me and now of course mccabe is deeply involved using the full force and might of the
[03:57:01.760 --> 03:57:09.520]  fbi uh... as the thugs who are running the wide scale witch hunt against the trump family
[03:57:09.520 --> 03:57:18.400]  loret high executioner uh... muller who we now know was appointed uh... at the behest of white house
[03:57:18.400 --> 03:57:25.520]  chief of staff uh... brine's previous through the auspices of the number two man at the justice
[03:57:25.520 --> 03:57:33.280]  department rod rozenstein all at the behest of democrat congressman yes alijah comings
[03:57:33.280 --> 03:57:42.320]  president needs to clean this rat's nest out and i think mister mccabe should be among the first
[03:57:42.960 --> 03:57:51.520]  to go so he is our bad guy for the week uh... while you're at it folks uh... before we're done here
[03:57:52.160 --> 03:58:00.320]  please go back to the info wars dot com website and pick up uh... i'm thinking now of the amazing
