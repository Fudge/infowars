[00:00.000 --> 00:08.160]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the Information War continues.
[00:08.160 --> 00:14.360]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:14.360 --> 00:18.000]  Welcome my friends, welcome and thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:18.000 --> 00:24.840]  It is the 7th day of March 2010 on this Sunday edition.
[00:24.840 --> 00:30.640]  We're going to have wide open phones later in the next half hour.
[00:30.640 --> 00:35.600]  The toll-free number to join us is 888-201-2244.
[00:35.600 --> 00:38.600]  That's 888-201-2244.
[00:38.600 --> 00:45.280]  Okay, I have a lot of economic news, a lot of police state news, a lot of good news as
[00:45.280 --> 00:54.240]  well as bad news on the battlefront against the illegitimate global banking syndicate
[00:54.240 --> 00:56.240]  setting up world government.
[00:56.240 --> 01:01.840]  Iceland's voters have rejected repayment plan.
[01:01.840 --> 01:04.040]  They've said no, we don't owe the banks this money.
[01:04.040 --> 01:10.960]  This was an engineered implosion, this was a engineered fraud and we are not going along
[01:10.960 --> 01:11.960]  with this.
[01:11.960 --> 01:14.520]  Here it is from the New York Times today.
[01:14.520 --> 01:16.960]  Iceland voters reject repayment plan.
[01:16.960 --> 01:22.040]  We had, of course, the leader of the main opposition against the banking dictatorship
[01:22.040 --> 01:26.320]  on a month ago, a member of the Icelandic parliament, we're getting her back on this
[01:26.320 --> 01:31.240]  week, Jones-Dautier, but we're going to be covering that later in the next hour.
[01:31.240 --> 01:34.920]  Also McCain's draconian dietary supplement bill did.
[01:34.920 --> 01:41.000]  Of course, last month, papers reported that they're ordering health food stores, pharmacies,
[01:41.000 --> 01:50.040]  to not sell vitamin C, aloe vera, fish oil and any and every other supplement over the
[01:50.040 --> 01:56.000]  counter, big drug companies want their competition knocked out, but this bill that would set
[01:56.000 --> 02:01.680]  up similar systems here in the U.S. is in serious trouble now, so that is certainly
[02:01.680 --> 02:02.680]  good news.
[02:02.680 --> 02:06.360]  We'll be breaking that down coming up in the second hour and I want to go over a very
[02:06.360 --> 02:16.880]  informative MSNBC story from MSNBC television of all places, talk about the devil denouncing
[02:16.880 --> 02:23.720]  himself, five surprising ways your TV is slowly killing you.
[02:23.720 --> 02:28.240]  Now this has been known since the fifties after they just had a few years of the implementation
[02:28.240 --> 02:29.240]  of the television.
[02:29.240 --> 02:33.040]  We're going to be going over that today and also we have time because I mentioned this
[02:33.040 --> 02:43.720]  last week, New York City, New Mexico State and other areas around the country are admitting
[02:43.720 --> 02:47.920]  what we already knew, but now we know the police have been lying saying there are no
[02:47.920 --> 02:48.920]  quotas.
[02:48.920 --> 02:52.400]  Well, now it's admitted there are quotas and increased quotas to arrest you to give
[02:52.400 --> 02:56.600]  you tickets to throw the book at you, but the illegal aliens are above the law, which
[02:56.600 --> 03:00.000]  is also a discrimination issue.
[03:00.000 --> 03:06.360]  So we'll be going over that coming up obviously in the first hour and into the second hour
[03:06.360 --> 03:07.360]  with your phone calls.
[03:07.360 --> 03:12.640]  We're going to talk about the Pentagon shooting.
[03:12.640 --> 03:17.800]  I told you they'd stage false flag attacks in Austin and blame it on the Tea Parties.
[03:17.800 --> 03:23.800]  I told you they would stage attacks probably on the Pentagon or other military bases and
[03:23.800 --> 03:33.840]  blame it on 9-11 truth and I've been proven exactly right yet again because when I see
[03:33.840 --> 03:39.440]  them preconditioning for something, that's a tell like in poker.
[03:39.440 --> 03:44.280]  It's a 100% tell and that's only one piece of the information, one piece of info that
[03:44.280 --> 03:48.440]  goes into my overall analysis, but we got this Bedel guy.
[03:48.440 --> 03:58.680]  I was on Fox News last night, Geraldo at large and Geraldo really tried to skewer me.
[03:58.680 --> 04:03.920]  He tried to go, oh, is this going to discredit 9-11 truth, Alex?
[04:03.920 --> 04:09.440]  And he thought I would just go down that path with him of speculation.
[04:09.440 --> 04:14.400]  Instead I just went ahead and countered the fact that 9-11 was an inside job and pointed
[04:14.400 --> 04:19.760]  out that within one hour, we have the news articles within about 64 minutes, a little
[04:19.760 --> 04:24.560]  over an hour, all over TV, all over radio, all over print.
[04:24.560 --> 04:27.760]  They were saying that the Pentagon shooter was a 9-11 truth.
[04:27.760 --> 04:33.680]  Now, if you know how police investigations work, ladies and gentlemen, that lets anybody
[04:33.680 --> 04:36.480]  who's worked in media know this was staged.
[04:36.480 --> 04:41.080]  And then it turns out his family specifically warned the government.
[04:41.080 --> 04:45.400]  Just like the underwear bomber, just like the Fort Hood shooter, just like every other
[04:45.400 --> 04:48.680]  case we've seen, it's all coming up.
[04:48.680 --> 04:50.320]  This is key info.
[04:50.320 --> 04:53.920]  This confirms all of my predictions of where they were going.
[04:53.920 --> 04:58.920]  This is the beginning of more false flag to be blamed on real patriots, get ready.
[04:58.920 --> 05:02.840]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Akola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator
[05:02.840 --> 05:05.720]  that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[05:05.720 --> 05:07.840]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[05:07.840 --> 05:12.000]  I know because I use one every day in my own home and it's available right now to you.
[05:12.000 --> 05:15.560]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Akola Blue, you'll know what's

[06:04.640 --> 06:09.440]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[06:09.440 --> 06:10.440]  You want answers?
[06:10.440 --> 06:12.240]  Well, so does he.
[06:12.240 --> 06:16.760]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[06:16.760 --> 06:22.760]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[06:22.760 --> 06:33.000]  Okay, folks, it's Sunday, the 7th day of March, 2010, two hours layout before us.
[06:33.000 --> 06:39.040]  I got a bunch of news on the economy, on the police state, on what the big banks are doing,
[06:39.040 --> 06:45.000]  some victories against tyranny, Iceland rejecting the banking dictatorship, Greece has not rejected
[06:45.000 --> 06:50.640]  it, and it's fully fallen to tyranny by design, and even Democratic and Republican policy makers
[06:50.640 --> 06:55.680]  are saying the same thing may happen to the U.S. in the next 16 months.
[06:55.680 --> 07:00.840]  But they're saying we're going to have a depression if we don't capitulate to the banks.
[07:00.840 --> 07:05.960]  They've already taken your pension funds, they've already started moving in against your retirement,
[07:05.960 --> 07:09.760]  they've been taking your jobs away, now they want your social security.
[07:09.760 --> 07:14.080]  That's coming up in the next hour, understanding who the true enemy is.
[07:14.080 --> 07:18.480]  Not the bank down the street, that helps your community.
[07:18.480 --> 07:25.080]  Commerce and credit, the big international private cartel banks who aren't even banks,
[07:25.080 --> 07:27.680]  they're a bunch of made-offs.
[07:27.680 --> 07:30.480]  So that is coming up in the next hour.
[07:30.480 --> 07:39.000]  We're going to open the phones up throughout the broadcast today, 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244.
[07:39.000 --> 07:42.360]  Of course, I'm Alex Jones, your host dedicated to liberty and freedom.
[07:42.360 --> 07:47.920]  We're not right-wing, we're not left-wing, we're constitutionalist, we're Americans,
[07:47.920 --> 07:52.920]  we're freedom lovers, we're lovers of truth.
[07:52.920 --> 07:59.720]  And we tell the truth, we break down the facts, we let the chips fall where they may.
[07:59.720 --> 08:06.560]  Now for new listeners, I would challenge you to go back in the last year to all the articles
[08:06.560 --> 08:13.760]  we wrote at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com with headlines like government to stage terror
[08:13.760 --> 08:18.160]  attacks to be blamed on Tea Party Movement 9-11-Truth.
[08:18.160 --> 08:23.040]  Paul Watson wrote another one Wednesday.
[08:23.040 --> 08:26.920]  I have specifically in the last two months said they're going to stage a terror attack
[08:26.920 --> 08:34.640]  on Austin, probably on a government building, to be blamed on the Tea Parties and or 9-11-Truth.
[08:34.640 --> 08:39.800]  I've said separately look for planes to be bombed, military bases to be attacked, and
[08:39.800 --> 08:44.800]  IRS buildings, and other federal buildings because I know how the feds work.
[08:44.800 --> 08:47.200]  The feds carried out the Oklahoma City bombing.
[08:47.200 --> 08:52.160]  That came out in federal documents, the Odyssey, Jason Mermas' new film, Invisible Empire.
[08:52.160 --> 08:57.720]  He dug up actual FBI recordings that were just recently declassified of them cooking
[08:57.720 --> 09:03.600]  the bomb, training the driver in the 1993 World Trade Center attack.
[09:03.600 --> 09:08.080]  New declassified documents about the feds running the attack on Oklahoma City and setting
[09:08.080 --> 09:12.680]  up their special forces operative, Tim McVeigh.
[09:12.680 --> 09:18.560]  The point is we know this stuff has gone on before, and we know that when 30-plus states
[09:18.560 --> 09:25.040]  are moving to declare sovereignty, the banking takeover of America is very unpopular.
[09:25.040 --> 09:32.260]  We know that when the Tea Party begins to explode and take over the Republican Party,
[09:32.260 --> 09:38.000]  we know that the government's going to try to go in and take the Tea Parties over and
[09:38.000 --> 09:43.040]  kind of bend them back towards serving big government and corruption.
[09:43.040 --> 09:47.000]  And now Obama's created something called a coffee party to try to go in and take over
[09:47.000 --> 09:48.280]  the Tea Parties.
[09:48.280 --> 09:53.280]  Actually, my listener's idea two months ago was to have the true patriots who are real
[09:53.280 --> 09:58.480]  constitutionalists go take the Tea Parties back over that we started three, four years
[09:58.480 --> 10:04.160]  ago, 9-11 Truth, and then the Ron Paul in the Fed movement, which mainstream media admits
[10:04.160 --> 10:10.120]  actually founded it, the coffee party to wake up the Tea Party to the mainline Republicans
[10:10.120 --> 10:16.400]  trying to co-op them, we need to co-op their party instead of the other way around.
[10:16.400 --> 10:20.240]  So there's a battle for the heart and soul of the Tea Parties.
[10:20.240 --> 10:24.440]  But they have made the decision to go ahead and demonize the Tea Parties.
[10:24.440 --> 10:26.720]  The feds do the same thing over and over again.
[10:26.720 --> 10:31.240]  One reason they bombed Oklahoma City was to then play the part of victims and go after
[10:31.240 --> 10:32.560]  their political enemies.
[10:32.560 --> 10:37.040]  Hitler blew up the Reichstag, fire bombed it to blame it on his political enemies.
[10:37.040 --> 10:44.360]  There's been over 200 declassified cases, Operation Gladio, NATO option, Ajax, USS Liberty
[10:44.360 --> 10:51.000]  now completely declassified two years ago, Chicago Tribune headline, NSA declassifies,
[10:51.000 --> 10:58.720]  intercepts, confirms that Israel premeditatedly attacked the USS Liberty in 67 to blame it
[10:58.720 --> 11:00.280]  on Egypt.
[11:00.280 --> 11:02.320]  Blow the ship up, but they couldn't sink it.
[11:02.320 --> 11:04.720]  For hours they torpedoed and bombed it.
[11:04.720 --> 11:10.760]  Our own military was involved, McNamara got on the line and said, you know, let the ship
[11:10.760 --> 11:12.040]  go to the bottom.
[11:12.040 --> 11:16.440]  I've interviewed the admirals, they're almost all dead, Admiral Moore and others, but those
[11:16.440 --> 11:17.440]  interviews are out there.
[11:17.440 --> 11:22.840]  I've interviewed the, was it six of the admirals, two of the admirals on the ships, or was it
[11:22.840 --> 11:23.840]  Admiral Geiss?
[11:23.840 --> 11:25.640]  I mean, just, just all of them.
[11:25.640 --> 11:35.080]  This was a staged false flag event and bizarrely enough, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
[11:35.080 --> 11:38.960]  Staff two years ago went to Israel and gave a speech and said, don't try something like
[11:38.960 --> 11:42.480]  this again to get us into war with Iran.
[11:42.480 --> 11:45.000]  And then it turned out Cheney was planning.
[11:45.000 --> 11:50.840]  This was reported by MSNBC and the New Yorker magazine two years ago, that a year before
[11:50.840 --> 11:57.240]  that, three years ago, Cheney wanted to create fake Iranian patrol boats in US naval shipyards
[11:57.240 --> 12:03.480]  and have them attack US ships in the Strait of Hormuz or in the Persian Gulf.
[12:03.480 --> 12:12.240]  So this is done over and over again and to deny that governments do this is a fraud.
[12:12.240 --> 12:16.560]  And so I've dug up some of the US government documents.
[12:16.560 --> 12:21.320]  Here's operation, Northwoods, ABC news, US military, give me a document cam shot guys
[12:21.320 --> 12:24.040]  for prison planet.tv.
[12:24.040 --> 12:28.920]  Here's just some of these US military wanted to provoke war with Cuba.
[12:28.920 --> 12:32.880]  Military directed plans to terrorize US cities to provoke war with Cuba.
[12:32.880 --> 12:38.680]  So there's an ABC news headline, but don't just read ABC news, don't just believe them.
[12:38.680 --> 12:46.480]  Here is operation Northwoods, memorandum for Secretary of Defense, justification for US
[12:46.480 --> 12:47.480]  military intervention.
[12:47.480 --> 12:53.240]  And it talks about how to stage shootings at the Pentagon, where they control things
[12:53.240 --> 13:00.080]  and at the Capitol where they can stage fake shootings, fake grazings, fake grazings.
[13:00.080 --> 13:02.160]  What do we see?
[13:02.160 --> 13:05.280]  Just a few days ago, grazings.
[13:05.280 --> 13:10.560]  I mean, it's, I'm not a bad American if I have a government plan to stage grazings.
[13:10.560 --> 13:18.280]  Ashley says, grazings, do it at military bases where they control it, DC, Miami, or
[13:18.280 --> 13:23.680]  really attack our troops at Guantanamo Bay using US troops dressed up like Cubans and
[13:23.680 --> 13:25.680]  kill Marines.
[13:25.680 --> 13:28.520]  Oh, that's very patriotic.
[13:28.520 --> 13:35.240]  And now it turns out Bobby Kennedy proposed even more before this back in the 60s bombing
[13:35.240 --> 13:43.000]  US embassies, hijacking jets, paramotor control, crashing them, plastic explosive bomb attacks
[13:43.000 --> 13:52.680]  against US bases inside the US and outside, wounding Americans, staging grazings.
[13:52.680 --> 13:57.120]  And so I went on Fox News and said, look, Gulf of Tonkin's declassified.
[13:57.120 --> 13:58.120]  They stage that.
[13:58.120 --> 13:59.120]  Northwoods declassified.
[13:59.120 --> 14:03.920]  And the lady starts laughing and Geraldo Rivera has to go, well, actually, you know,
[14:03.920 --> 14:06.400]  the Gulf of Tonkin is declassified.
[14:06.400 --> 14:07.960]  They did stage that.
[14:07.960 --> 14:11.800]  No, they staged it all.
[14:11.800 --> 14:14.280]  So here's the deal.
[14:14.280 --> 14:18.760]  And I'm going to go over the Army Field Manual, just one of the declassified Army Field Manuals.
[14:18.760 --> 14:20.520]  Show it to you here on air.
[14:20.520 --> 14:27.040]  This is the Field Manual used from 1996 until 2004.
[14:27.040 --> 14:32.200]  That was the current manual during that period for Army captains and above who were in special
[14:32.200 --> 14:35.760]  ops are all taught how to stage terror attacks.
[14:35.760 --> 14:40.960]  Oh, you're, you're overwhelmed in an area where you're force multiplying trying to take
[14:40.960 --> 14:43.320]  over and they give an example of Latin America.
[14:43.320 --> 14:48.280]  Well, you just go and commit an atrocity and blame it on the local enemy and then you'll
[14:48.280 --> 14:51.640]  get the people to turn to your aid.
[14:51.640 --> 14:55.120]  This is in justifies the means and look for soldiers.
[14:55.120 --> 15:01.160]  This is something that's acceptable and they groom them for black ops and they pick psychological
[15:01.160 --> 15:03.760]  types that believe the end justifies the means.
[15:03.760 --> 15:10.080]  Most of the troops aren't taught this and it goes back to chess invented by the Persians
[15:10.080 --> 15:12.160]  a 4,000 years ago.
[15:12.160 --> 15:14.840]  It goes back to chess.
[15:14.840 --> 15:19.440]  It's called a gamut or gambit sacrifice of a pawn.
[15:19.440 --> 15:21.440]  In fact, print me the definition of gamut.
[15:21.440 --> 15:23.840]  I want to make sure I'm giving the exact definition.
[15:23.840 --> 15:29.760]  It's sacrificing upon or opening a major operation with a small sacrifice.
[15:29.760 --> 15:31.760]  And it's taught at West Point.
[15:31.760 --> 15:36.040]  You put 500 troops into a pass, you got 10,000 waiting, you draw out the enemy.
[15:36.040 --> 15:40.120]  No and those 500 troops are all going to get killed, but then you've exposed the enemy.
[15:40.120 --> 15:42.200]  Then you bring in your main force.
[15:42.200 --> 15:45.760]  So yeah, blow up the world trade centers, kill 3,000 Americans.
[15:45.760 --> 15:46.760]  That's a gambit.
[15:46.760 --> 15:48.840]  You understand that?
[15:48.840 --> 15:50.480]  That's collateral damage.
[15:50.480 --> 15:53.840]  Soldiers go on one way missions knowing they're sacrificing themselves.
[15:53.840 --> 15:57.520]  Why shouldn't Americans sacrifice a little in the war against Islam?
[15:57.520 --> 16:00.360]  Hold the ride buck.
[16:00.360 --> 16:01.560]  What's your home worth?

[19:08.160 --> 19:12.480]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[19:12.480 --> 19:13.480]  at home.
[19:13.480 --> 19:18.160]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are
[19:18.160 --> 19:19.240]  calling the shots.
[19:19.240 --> 19:24.480]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[19:24.480 --> 19:30.520]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel hell-bent
[19:30.520 --> 19:34.560]  on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[19:34.560 --> 19:39.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[19:39.000 --> 19:41.000]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[19:41.000 --> 19:47.000]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[19:47.000 --> 19:48.000]  of the Republic.

[20:52.240 --> 20:56.720]  up when we're not live at restreams 24 hours a day and has a link to the free podcast as
[20:56.720 --> 21:03.880]  well. I want to give you the definition of gambit chess, an opening in which a player
[21:03.880 --> 21:14.520]  seeks to obtain some advantage by sacrificing a pawn or piece. And in army field manual
[21:14.520 --> 21:23.480]  FM 31-20-3, this came out two years ago. It was in use until 2004. The government went
[21:23.480 --> 21:28.800]  after WikiLeaks and had it removed, but not before it was posted elsewhere and confirmed
[21:28.800 --> 21:33.040]  it was real and said it was a national security breach and it teaches army captains and above
[21:33.040 --> 21:38.440]  how to stage terror attacks. And of course it was declassified two weeks ago by the state
[21:38.440 --> 21:44.480]  department that Bobby Kennedy wanted to bomb U.S. embassies to blame it on the Honduran
[21:44.480 --> 21:48.600]  government to invade and his brother, the president said no. It was an idea of Robert
[21:48.600 --> 21:53.400]  McNamara, the same guy that then staged the USS Liberty with Israel a few years later
[21:53.400 --> 21:59.440]  when he was in the LBJ administration. They also staged the Gulf of Tonkin. Our ships
[21:59.440 --> 22:04.320]  were never attacked on that date and that's since been declassified.
[22:04.320 --> 22:10.040]  The issue here is governments all do this. This is a tool. The Russians do it. The Communist
[22:10.040 --> 22:16.120]  Chinese do it. The Nazis did it. The Italian government, a bunch of people went to prison
[22:16.120 --> 22:20.720]  in the government in the last few years for bombings in the 80s where they would bomb
[22:20.720 --> 22:24.960]  school buses, police stations and blame it on their political enemies. Every time an
[22:24.960 --> 22:30.480]  outside political party starts getting traction in Italy especially, the government just blows
[22:30.480 --> 22:37.720]  something up and demonizes them on the news. Now, Operation Northwoods, that ABC News and
[22:37.720 --> 22:44.280]  the Associated Press report on talks about staging shootings at U.S. military bases
[22:44.280 --> 22:53.400]  in D.C., i.e. the Pentagon. Grazings. What was it? Was it 2000? That it was all over
[22:53.400 --> 23:00.480]  mainstream news. BBC, you name it, that the Taiwanese president staged a grazing of himself
[23:00.480 --> 23:04.760]  in a parade when he was about to lose the election in two days. So he could be a hero
[23:04.760 --> 23:09.840]  and actually worked. He wasn't really shot. They had a guy fire blanks and they claimed
[23:09.840 --> 23:15.800]  he'd been shot and put some red, red fake blood on him. So I'm not saying that this
[23:15.800 --> 23:22.480]  was staged. We don't know yet but the initial indications are it follows the same pattern
[23:22.480 --> 23:30.920]  and within one hour and five minutes of the shooting at the Pentagon, it was all over
[23:30.920 --> 23:39.160]  national news Thursday night that this guy was a 9-11 truther. Thousands of posts about
[23:39.160 --> 23:47.520]  being a libertarian, supporting the Von Mies school of Austrian economics, being a liberal,
[23:47.520 --> 23:56.360]  supporting Congressman Gravel, being a 9-11 truther, sending the Pentagon his nanotech
[23:56.360 --> 24:05.320]  ideas that he was a manic depressant on medication. But out of literally scores of things he said,
[24:05.320 --> 24:13.360]  they chose 9-11 truth within an hour and five minutes to demonize 9-11 truth. Just like
[24:13.360 --> 24:18.160]  they had the tragic attack on the IRS office building, Echelon building here in Austin
[24:18.160 --> 24:24.000]  a few weeks ago, and I went on air an hour and 15 minutes after it happened, what had
[24:24.000 --> 24:31.640]  happened basically at about 9.55. I went on air at 11 a.m. that weekday and I said, watch,
[24:31.640 --> 24:36.880]  they'll be blaming it on the tea parties and myself within hours. Austin, American statesman
[24:36.880 --> 24:42.720]  implied that I supported it, total lie, total defamation, whatever. That's why they're discredited.
[24:42.720 --> 24:49.920]  Have fun, tell the lies you want. New York Daily News, Time Magazine, Newsweek, New York
[24:49.920 --> 24:56.880]  Times, going after who? Alex Jones, Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, last week demonizing
[24:56.880 --> 25:04.040]  me saying 9-11 truth is going to be violent. How did I know all this was coming? A year
[25:04.040 --> 25:11.040]  ago, Ploplowski in Pittsburgh, 7 a.m. He's drunk, got home at 3 a.m. drunk. He's got two
[25:11.040 --> 25:15.720]  pit bulls. He's a former Marine. They're urinating all over the floor. His mother said, she said,
[25:15.720 --> 25:20.560]  I'm kicking you out. She called the police. He threw a fit and shot three of them. Within
[25:20.560 --> 25:27.660]  two hours of him giving up and being arrested, they put in the newspaper with a writer who
[25:27.660 --> 25:31.880]  writes PR pieces for the Southern Poverty Law Center and others that he was a fan of
[25:31.880 --> 25:36.280]  Alex Jones and they had plants on the street outside his house saying, oh, I'm friends
[25:36.280 --> 25:44.240]  with Ploplowski. He likes Alex Jones. Total plants within two hours on TV. Then it turned
[25:44.240 --> 25:50.000]  out he actually hated me and attacked me for years on the Internet because I'm not a white
[25:50.000 --> 25:56.200]  supremacist. Now, why within two hours of those cops being killed would I be fingered
[25:56.200 --> 26:01.800]  as the person that caused it? Just like Limbaugh was accused of causing Oklahoma City within
[26:01.800 --> 26:08.240]  two hours by Bill Clinton. Why? It's not Rush Limbaugh anymore. It's Alex Jones when this
[26:08.240 --> 26:13.440]  happens who gets blamed. And we got Glenn Beck blaming constitutionalist, burthers,
[26:13.440 --> 26:17.160]  truthers. In the last few months, he kept saying constitutionalist, burthers, truthers,
[26:17.160 --> 26:20.960]  they're going to get violent. They're going to attack. When there had been no evidence
[26:20.960 --> 26:26.880]  of truthers or burthers being violent ever, how did they know this? It sounded ridiculous
[26:26.880 --> 26:30.880]  unless they were getting ready to stage something and the talking points being given to the
[26:30.880 --> 26:34.280]  establishment were that we were going to be violent. Southern Prairie Law Center saying
[26:34.280 --> 26:43.160]  it, ADL saying it, Chris Matthews parroting it, O'Reilly parroting it, Glenn Beck parroting
[26:43.160 --> 26:51.000]  it, gearing up, getting everybody ready for this to happen, for this to unfold. And so
[26:51.000 --> 26:54.640]  that's why I've been saying every day for the last two months, they're going to stage
[26:54.640 --> 27:00.720]  terror attacks in America because they've got to. 9-11 truth in some polls like Angus
[27:00.720 --> 27:05.360]  and Reed, New York Times, 84% of Americans questioned the official story of 9-11. Six
[27:05.360 --> 27:09.320]  of the 10 commission members, they've got commission lawyers like farmer writing books
[27:09.320 --> 27:13.320]  about how it was all a cover up in the fraud. They've got all this coming out. What are
[27:13.320 --> 27:18.160]  they going to do? They've got the burthers more than half of registered Republicans
[27:18.160 --> 27:22.880]  saying they believe Obama's covering up his birth certificate. So they have somebody we
[27:22.880 --> 27:28.560]  can trust. Glenn Beck come out supposedly can trust and say, oh, only 5% of the Tea
[27:28.560 --> 27:33.120]  parties with no evidence are burthers and they're dangerous. They might do something
[27:33.120 --> 27:38.720]  violent. And then he sandwiches that bad info in with incredibly good info. I watched Beck
[27:38.720 --> 27:42.640]  Friday and I was like liking him. It was, he was exposing the other brainwashing kids
[27:42.640 --> 27:48.560]  in school and Metsha and LaRosa and the New World Order and the UN, but he does that so
[27:48.560 --> 27:54.160]  he can then turn around on you a week later. The point is, that's why he's so dangerous
[27:54.160 --> 28:00.600]  because I've seen him over and over again at key junctures. Sabotage the true Liberty
[28:00.600 --> 28:05.400]  movement, but, but side issue coming back from the break. I'm going to play parts of
[28:05.400 --> 28:10.720]  this Arraldo Rivera interview they did with me last night on Fox news so we can break
[28:10.720 --> 28:19.120]  down what's really going on here because I told you before hours before about an hour
[28:19.120 --> 28:23.160]  and a half before within three hours of it happening that we're saying, and I said, watch
[28:23.160 --> 28:29.240]  if this is staged, they're going to blame it on the Tea parties and on 9 11 truth. And
[28:29.240 --> 28:34.200]  they did. And then it turns out that a weird government contractor with Homeland Security
[28:34.200 --> 28:38.640]  owned the small hanger. This plane was in a Homeland Security expert on remote control
[28:38.640 --> 28:44.400]  aircraft. Turns out his family says stack didn't write that on and on and on. And the
[28:44.400 --> 28:50.160]  same stuff is now coming out with this guy. And then we have the underwear bombing where
[28:50.160 --> 28:56.400]  it's 100% confirmed that guy was a government Patsy. That's all coming up. And where all
[28:56.400 --> 29:04.280]  this is leading will be right back. Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones. I want to tell you about
[29:04.280 --> 29:09.520]  the silver lungs generator. Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver
[29:09.520 --> 29:14.800]  the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[29:14.800 --> 29:19.440]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[29:19.440 --> 29:24.680]  The silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self produced nano silver
[29:24.680 --> 29:31.560]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued
[29:31.560 --> 29:37.200]  legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products. You can now produce pure and endless
[29:37.200 --> 29:42.800]  colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator. Very easy to follow step by step instructions
[29:42.800 --> 29:50.360]  are provided, making production fast and simple. Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more
[29:50.360 --> 29:59.880]  about the breakthrough technology of the silver lungs generator. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[29:59.880 --> 30:04.520]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[30:04.520 --> 30:08.840]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[30:08.840 --> 30:13.200]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[30:13.200 --> 30:18.240]  allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[30:18.240 --> 30:22.920]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[30:22.920 --> 30:28.560]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[30:28.560 --> 30:32.880]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands
[30:32.880 --> 30:37.000]  of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power
[30:37.000 --> 30:41.320]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe
[30:41.320 --> 30:45.640]  in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[30:45.640 --> 30:52.560]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government

[32:25.480 --> 32:30.160]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd. The following week, they'll produce huge
[32:30.160 --> 32:35.040]  runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you and this buy three, get one
[32:35.040 --> 32:40.640]  free program. Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see. Another example,
[32:40.640 --> 32:46.120]  buy nine months worth of food and get three months free. You've got to go to eFoodsDirect.com

[33:06.000 --> 33:23.240]  Jones Broadcasting Network. We are back live, ladies and gentlemen. So the private banks
[33:23.240 --> 33:28.960]  that have hijacked our country need a way to demonize the tea parties, the birthers,
[33:28.960 --> 33:36.640]  9-11 truth. The government has the lowest approval rating in history, 8 percentage points.
[33:36.640 --> 33:43.560]  Ron Paul has a national approval rating of 84%, won the Republican primary by 80%. So
[33:43.560 --> 33:48.440]  people that are constitutionalist, anti-New World Order, they're in the 80s. The rest
[33:48.440 --> 33:54.120]  of the government is at 8%. 8% confidence that the government cares about the American
[33:54.120 --> 34:00.160]  people. That's come out in multiple polls between 8 and 12. There's been Rasmussen and
[34:00.160 --> 34:04.160]  other numbers. I'm sure you've seen it. We've covered it here on air. The point is people
[34:04.160 --> 34:12.320]  are waking up to the government and people are learning about false flag stage terror.
[34:12.320 --> 34:20.600]  So what is the system going to do? It is going to let nut cases out of 310 million Americans
[34:20.600 --> 34:27.520]  now, who they are aware of, who are going to try to carry out crimes, go postal for
[34:27.520 --> 34:32.040]  whatever reason. They're going to let them attack and protect them, bare minimum, open
[34:32.040 --> 34:38.280]  doors up for them. But in some cases, they're also going to stage events. And here it is,
[34:38.280 --> 34:45.480]  a New York Daily News Pentagon shooter, John Bedell's parents warned cops two weeks before
[34:45.480 --> 34:52.680]  that he was planning some type of violent attack. They warned them, but nothing was
[34:52.680 --> 34:59.720]  done. It turns out for two years, the Fort Hood shooter was emailing who he believed was
[34:59.720 --> 35:05.160]  Al Qaeda. He was praising suicide bombers on basis. He was left alone. If you're in
[35:05.160 --> 35:08.760]  the military and you criticize the president or anything in the government mildly, you
[35:08.760 --> 35:13.360]  get court marshals are kicked out and get a dishonorable discharge. He was left alone.
[35:13.360 --> 35:21.000]  Then we have Detroit news and other mainstream publications reporting that the underwear bomber,
[35:21.000 --> 35:24.280]  we told you this two weeks before it was in the news, because we had eyewitnesses like
[35:24.280 --> 35:28.840]  Kurt Haskell and others around the plane that he was led on in Amsterdam without a
[35:28.840 --> 35:34.440]  passport that he was protected. They saw a guy in a fancy suit go through security, through
[35:34.440 --> 35:38.880]  the checkpoint and onto the gate and onto the plane. So he doesn't need an ID and this
[35:38.880 --> 35:45.720]  guy had such authority that he was able to get the underwear bomber on. And then the
[35:45.720 --> 35:49.400]  FBI lied about this and said Kurt Haskell and others were wrong and said they wouldn't
[35:49.400 --> 35:54.880]  release the surveillance tapes. And then it came out later that the under secretary of
[35:54.880 --> 36:00.120]  state for the state department said this was all over the news, but in newspapers, never
[36:00.120 --> 36:06.800]  on TV until last night when I got on Fox, first time it's gotten out there that US intelligence
[36:06.800 --> 36:12.520]  ordered him to be allowed on the plane and helped on the plane as part of a wider investigation.
[36:12.520 --> 36:18.600]  Bologna. They wanted to sell the naked body scanners. In fact, I've got that here in my
[36:18.600 --> 36:25.240]  stack. I've shown it over and over again the last few months here on air, but I want to
[36:25.240 --> 36:32.480]  go ahead and here it is. Give me a document cam shop because it's not just a radio show
[36:32.480 --> 36:38.600]  of your prison planet on TV. You can watch this right now. Here it is. Detroit news terror
[36:38.600 --> 36:43.000]  suspect kept visa to avoid tipping off larger investigation and they helped him get on the
[36:43.000 --> 36:47.920]  plane and they have the government admitting this. There was a lot of other lies as well.
[36:47.920 --> 36:58.560]  So it goes on and on and on. Here's another big tip off within one hour and five minutes
[36:58.560 --> 37:03.120]  of the shooting at the Pentagon Thursday night, it was on national news times of London. You
[37:03.120 --> 37:09.760]  name it that he was a 9 11 truth or why are they after 9 11 truth? Why are they immediately
[37:09.760 --> 37:15.360]  coming out and blaming 9 11 truth? How did they discover that so quickly in a normal investigation?
[37:15.360 --> 37:20.480]  There's no way that would happen for even 12 hours to 24 hours. And now it's all over
[37:20.480 --> 37:25.520]  the news and Fox invites me on. People say, well, why'd they invite you on to say, I
[37:25.520 --> 37:30.320]  mean, I knew what Geraldo was going to say before I even went on. Well, this discredits
[37:30.320 --> 37:35.280]  9 11 truth, doesn't it? Mr. Jones, what are you going to do now? And that's exactly what
[37:35.280 --> 37:41.080]  he did. So I just laid out the fact that the majority of Americans, depending on the poll,
[37:41.080 --> 37:47.480]  36% to 84% and it runs the gamut, but on average, it's over 60%. And national polls believe
[37:47.480 --> 37:54.080]  we're being lied to about the official story of 9 11. Just Google majority of Americans
[37:54.080 --> 38:00.440]  believe 9 11 cover up and you'll get all the different polls. And that's what they did
[38:00.440 --> 38:06.920]  on the show. And then I laid out real examples of stage terror or stage provocations for war.
[38:06.920 --> 38:11.840]  And his guest host said, how dare you make these allegations? What's your proof? And
[38:11.840 --> 38:18.840]  Geraldo had to say, well, actually it is true that Gulf of Tonkin was staged. So I want
[38:18.840 --> 38:23.040]  to play part of this Fox news piece. Now from last night, we'll come back and play the rest.
[38:23.040 --> 38:27.760]  Then I'll go through all the bullet points, but of all the political beliefs this guy
[38:27.760 --> 38:32.320]  supposedly had, and he could have been alone, not who they allowed to attack. They could
[38:32.320 --> 38:37.160]  have missed the warnings. It could be real, but all the evidence points towards this being
[38:37.160 --> 38:42.920]  staged. And I told you, this is the political season for this as distrust of the government
[38:42.920 --> 38:48.440]  and an awakening of the American people exponentially grows. They need a way to demonize these
[38:48.440 --> 38:53.080]  ideas to, to, to then say, Oh my gosh, these people are dangerous. Just like the internal
[38:53.080 --> 38:57.400]  Homeland Security, Mike reports we got last year from law enforcement that then made national
[38:57.400 --> 39:03.960]  news showed the number one enemy of government of Homeland Security is conservatives, libertarians,
[39:03.960 --> 39:07.760]  gun owners in the fetters. And they teach the military and police that we're terrorists
[39:07.760 --> 39:12.120]  that want to kill them. They want their security forces mistrusting us so they will abuse
[39:12.120 --> 39:18.360]  us and spy on us. And notice who's getting attacked, the IRS, the military, clearly the
[39:18.360 --> 39:23.360]  targets that the government and its own documents says they like to target to then get them
[39:23.360 --> 39:29.040]  to hate the American people. So here is Geraldo Rivera with his hit piece. Coming up the Pentagon
[39:29.040 --> 39:35.000]  shooter was one of those conspiracy theorists who believes 9 11 was an inside job. What
[39:35.000 --> 39:40.000]  will that mean to that movement? Judge the success of their actions through public opinion,
[39:40.000 --> 39:45.200]  which can be manipulated in very effective ways, creating irresistible incentives for
[39:45.200 --> 39:51.480]  governments to use deception as a standard operating procedure. One of the greatest problems
[39:51.480 --> 39:57.080]  facing humanity today is the deliberate creation of conflict in order to extend the control
[39:57.080 --> 40:02.400]  of a tiny elite who seek to rule the world from the shadows. Once a star student at San
[40:02.400 --> 40:07.120]  Jose State, 36 year old John Patrick Bedell, the man who opened fire in front of the Pentagon
[40:07.120 --> 40:13.720]  last week was a manic depressive pothead fascinated with conspiracy theories involving 9 11. We
[40:13.720 --> 40:19.040]  still don't know why he shot the two Pentagon guards before being shot.
[40:19.040 --> 40:23.480]  So also they're saying pot makes you kill people. Now it's like reefer madness. When
[40:23.480 --> 40:27.640]  every study shows it with the average person, it makes them less violent. Turns out this
[40:27.640 --> 40:33.160]  guy was on psychiatric drugs. The insert for the Prozac family of drugs, serotonin reuptake
[40:33.160 --> 40:41.000]  inhibitors says it causes psychotic breaks, violence, suicide, mania. I mean, how many
[40:41.000 --> 40:45.600]  of the mass shooters in every case? I've never seen a big case where they weren't on these
[40:45.600 --> 40:52.240]  drugs, but they're not blaming it on the drugs. No, he may on some message boards of question
[40:52.240 --> 40:58.160]  9 11 and they played audio of him talking about supposedly Bedell talking about this
[40:58.160 --> 41:04.240]  stuff. Now, Geraldo after demonizing it after introducing it cuts to me and says, does this
[41:04.240 --> 41:10.440]  discredit your movement? Well, so if somebody who's a Dallas Cowboys fan does something
[41:10.440 --> 41:15.000]  violent, does that discredit the Dallas Cowboys or when post office workers go crazy sometimes
[41:15.000 --> 41:20.760]  and kill people because they are veterans who who may be unstable from post traumatic
[41:20.760 --> 41:26.080]  stress disorder. Does that demonize the whole military? I mean, if somebody's a Republican
[41:26.080 --> 41:33.000]  or a Democrat and commits a crime. See, no, this is about demonization. So I guess, depending
[41:33.000 --> 41:37.640]  on the poll, more than half the American people are now terrorists, because if you have if
[41:37.640 --> 41:40.960]  you believe in conspiracy theories, that means questioning anything the government says or
[41:40.960 --> 41:46.160]  does. Or if you question 9 11, like six of the 10 commissioners, you're bad. Continue
[41:46.160 --> 41:52.080]  killed himself. But we do note that a blog connected to him suggests the criminal enterprise
[41:52.080 --> 41:58.520]  run out of the government could have staged the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
[41:58.520 --> 42:03.560]  And that connection to the so called 9 11 truthers is making their movement seem even
[42:03.560 --> 42:08.840]  more like a part of the lunatic fringe. But is that fair? Joining Kimberly and me from
[42:08.840 --> 42:13.760]  Austin, Texas, the same town incidentally where a tax protester recently crashed his
[42:13.760 --> 42:19.760]  plane into the IRS building is radio host and a leader of the 9 11 was an inside job
[42:19.760 --> 42:28.240]  movement. Alex Jones, Alex, welcome. So I'm in Austin. And actually, the London Guardian
[42:28.240 --> 42:35.560]  wrote an article saying Alex Jones is the cause of all this. Alex Jones. Print me that
[42:35.560 --> 42:40.080]  London Guardian story. Just Alex Jones, London Guardian. I was actually in the headline. I
[42:40.080 --> 42:46.440]  think it's Austin, Texas, center of conspiracy. They said I caused all this and then I'm causing
[42:46.440 --> 42:52.320]  a mass psychosis worldwide. Boy, I'm pretty powerful. No, the government lying is causing
[42:52.320 --> 42:57.800]  people not to trust him. So just pure demonization will come back with my response on the other
[42:57.800 --> 43:06.120]  side. One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system. The main event
[43:06.120 --> 43:10.320]  is the wholesale destruction of the world economy to push for every nation on the globe
[43:10.320 --> 43:16.400]  to identify and number all of its citizens. Friends, I hope that you will order shadow

[44:02.720 --> 44:07.440]  buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double
[44:07.440 --> 44:11.800]  or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how
[44:11.800 --> 44:16.520]  much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control
[44:16.520 --> 44:21.840]  of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of
[44:21.840 --> 44:26.880]  the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation
[44:26.880 --> 44:31.320]  is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local
[44:31.320 --> 44:35.960]  grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number
[44:35.960 --> 44:40.960]  five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks,
[44:40.960 --> 44:44.600]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science. One of

[47:08.440 --> 47:25.880]  All I do is study black ops and how the globalists operate. I don't just make predictions. Months,
[47:25.880 --> 47:32.480]  six months, three months, two months, a week before 9-11. It's all over YouTube, all over
[47:32.480 --> 47:41.480]  the web, thousands of Austinites saw it. I remember Jimmy Vaughn in 2002, the blues legend
[47:41.480 --> 47:45.320]  showed up at my road to tyranny showing at Alamo draft house and I said, why are you
[47:45.320 --> 47:51.920]  here? And he said, I saw you on TV in July of 2001 predicting the attack. And now we're
[47:51.920 --> 47:57.360]  good friends. The point is, I don't just make predictions. I told you in January of last
[47:57.360 --> 48:02.040]  year they were going to stage a big flu outbreak because we got government documents that they
[48:02.040 --> 48:06.440]  were telling local police, get ready for it, it's going to happen, martial law, millions
[48:06.440 --> 48:13.440]  of dead. And I said, this may just be the feds hyping fear to test federalization. That
[48:13.440 --> 48:17.560]  doesn't mean I'm saying we're going to have martial law and millions dead. The feds were
[48:17.560 --> 48:24.760]  saying that. I had emergency managers on disguising their voices. I got secret documents
[48:24.760 --> 48:29.940]  out of the Bureau of Cemetery's New York telling them the same thing. And there were a lot
[48:29.940 --> 48:35.240]  of other indicators and then three months later in April, it started, the fear started.
[48:35.240 --> 48:40.600]  So they always pre-program and they've been pre-programming that 9-11 truth in the tea
[48:40.600 --> 48:47.040]  parties and the burthers are going to start killing people with no evidence that it never
[48:47.040 --> 48:56.920]  happened before. And so I said, something is going on here. Get ready. Put the Guardian
[48:56.920 --> 49:04.720]  article back up. I mentioned it in the last segment. So he introduces me, Geraldo Rivera.
[49:04.720 --> 49:09.320]  And he says, basically, because I'm in Austin, you know, the same place the guy flew the
[49:09.320 --> 49:13.840]  plane into the building. You know, the message is I'm causing all of this. And the Guardian
[49:13.840 --> 49:22.280]  actually said it in an article titled Austin, Texas Paranoid Politics Central, London Guardian.
[49:22.280 --> 49:27.120]  And it goes on to say that I have caused like a black hole and then I have this empire
[49:27.120 --> 49:32.200]  and this black hole of evil is like sucking in the whole planet. I mean, the article is
[49:32.200 --> 49:36.560]  incredible. I never even read it on air. I probably should. And then I'm the cause of
[49:36.560 --> 49:43.720]  all this. And so now Geraldo Rivera has me up on air saying, oh, you know, are you discredited
[49:43.720 --> 49:48.160]  now? You know, is your movement discredited? 9-11 truth discredited. By the way, he joins
[49:48.160 --> 49:54.320]  us from the same town where the guy flew the plane into the building. So this is the message.
[49:54.320 --> 50:01.280]  This is the programming that's going on. And within hours of the attack, the Austin American
[50:01.280 --> 50:09.240]  Statesman, New York Daily News and scores of other publications attacked Alex Jones.
[50:09.240 --> 50:14.320]  And it's just as asinine as within hours, Bill Clinton blaming Rush Limbaugh for the
[50:14.320 --> 50:19.520]  Oklahoma City bombing. What is it that I'm saying that scares them so bad? Just two weeks
[50:19.520 --> 50:25.840]  ago, I was playing from the Sunday show, I was playing clips of Michael Savage. In fact,
[50:25.840 --> 50:30.040]  queue that up for the next hour where Savage was saying Obama's going to stage terror attacks
[50:30.040 --> 50:36.120]  to blame it on conservatives in America. I mean, he gets it. I was telling you two weeks
[50:36.120 --> 50:43.200]  ago on this show, look out. They're going to do it. Look out. And I was telling you
[50:43.200 --> 50:47.920]  a month ago, I was telling you. And again, I'm not saying, oh, look how smart I am. I'm
[50:47.920 --> 50:52.640]  not that smart. I've learned how these people operate. Let's go back to Geraldo Rivera and
[50:52.640 --> 50:58.000]  his demonization. And that connection to the so-called 9-11 truthers is making their movement
[50:58.000 --> 51:03.720]  seem even more like a part of the lunatic fringe. But is that fair? Joining Kimberly
[51:03.720 --> 51:08.560]  and me from Austin, Texas, the same town incidentally where a tax protester recently
[51:08.560 --> 51:14.480]  crashed his plane into the IRS building, his radio host and a leader of the 9-11 was an
[51:14.480 --> 51:21.760]  inside job movement, Alex Jones. Alex, welcome. The Tea Party people shook off that IRS plane
[51:21.760 --> 51:26.840]  crash incident after a couple of days. Do you think you'll be similarly successful or
[51:26.840 --> 51:32.920]  will Bedel's misdeeds stick to the 9-11 truth or people?
[51:32.920 --> 51:38.040]  Well, the plane crash guy had been a Democrat and was angry at the government. And this
[51:38.040 --> 51:44.600]  Bedel guy, I mean, look, he had hundreds of different beliefs and some national polls
[51:44.600 --> 51:49.840]  show half of Americans, six of the 10, 9-11 commissioners question the official story.
[51:49.840 --> 51:55.880]  There's a wide spectrum of different debates. 9-11 truth, most people just question the
[51:55.880 --> 52:01.680]  official story prior knowledge and other issues. But the bigger question here is, why within
[52:01.680 --> 52:07.840]  one hour was national news reporting that the Pentagon shooter was a 9-11 truth? I mean,
[52:07.840 --> 52:13.320]  why is there such a vitriol by the establishment against 9-11 truth? I mean, right here I
[52:13.320 --> 52:19.800]  have ABC News, U.S. military wanted to provoke war with Cuba, U.S. military drafted plans
[52:19.800 --> 52:25.200]  to terrorize U.S. cities, staged terror attacks. We know the Gulf of Tonkin was staged. So
[52:25.200 --> 52:29.800]  we know that governments allow attacks to happen. We know that governments sometimes
[52:29.800 --> 52:34.880]  actually stage attacks. We know that the underwear bomber on Christmas Day, the State Department
[52:34.880 --> 52:38.840]  admits they were ordered by U.S. intelligence to let him on the plane, help him get on the
[52:38.840 --> 52:43.360]  plane. So in a lot of cases, they open the door. That's what 9-11 truth is saying is
[52:43.360 --> 52:48.800]  that this is being used to demonize us. So we don't know what the truth is about this
[52:48.800 --> 52:49.800]  guy.
[52:49.800 --> 52:55.080]  Let's bring Kimmel into the discussion. The guy was into pot and he was a manic depressive.
[52:55.080 --> 52:58.920]  But is Alex overreacting or is the 9-11 connection relevant?
[52:58.920 --> 53:02.960]  Right. I think it's an overreaction, but also you're making some very serious allegations
[53:02.960 --> 53:07.040]  against the U.S. government saying that they stage attacks, they allow them to occur in
[53:07.040 --> 53:08.600]  the United States against U.S.
[53:08.600 --> 53:09.600]  Let's declassify.
[53:09.600 --> 53:13.000]  What? No, what evidence do you have to support any of that?
[53:13.000 --> 53:16.400]  Well, the Gulf of Tonkin is very, very well documented, but...
[53:16.400 --> 53:20.420]  I mean, what are you talking about? Hold on. It's an army field manuals to stage false
[53:20.420 --> 53:26.680]  flag attacks declassified 2004. But separately, why within one hour were scores of newspapers
[53:26.680 --> 53:33.680]  and TV, what's the answer? You tell us. Why are they so scared of 9-11 truth? Why did
[53:33.680 --> 53:38.920]  they do that? Within one hour, why do they bring 9-11 truth? Why do they blame?
[53:38.920 --> 53:45.120]  Now for radio listeners and prisonplanet.tv viewers, I will show you U.S. Special Forces
[53:45.120 --> 53:56.160]  counterinsurgency manual. This is the manual used as official policy for Black Ops commanders,
[53:56.160 --> 54:05.320]  many captains and above, from September 20th, 94 to 2004. Foreign internal defense tactics,
[54:05.320 --> 54:11.400]  techniques and procedures for Special Forces 2004 edition made by U.S. Army Doctrine Policy
[54:11.400 --> 54:18.600]  on 20 September 1994, 219 printed pages. Here's another army manual as well from 76 saying
[54:18.600 --> 54:23.720]  the same thing. And the document, which is official U.S. Special Forces policy directly
[54:23.720 --> 54:28.560]  advocates training paramilitaries, pervasive surveillance, censorship, press control, restrictions
[54:28.560 --> 54:34.360]  on labor unions, political parties, suspending habeas corpus, warrantless searches, detainment
[54:34.360 --> 54:38.560]  without charge, bribery, employing terrorist, false flag operations that describes how to
[54:38.560 --> 54:44.480]  do it, concealing human rights abuses in journalists, and extensive use of psychological operations
[54:44.480 --> 54:50.040]  propaganda to make these and other populations and rescue control measures, resource control
[54:50.040 --> 54:56.360]  measures, palatable. So they sell the police state by staging terror attacks. And I just
[54:56.360 --> 55:02.840]  read to you, ABC News, U.S. government plans to bomb U.S. cities and stage fake shootings,
[55:02.840 --> 55:13.320]  grazings, staged grazings, grazings at the Pentagon. They were grazed. So she's saying
[55:13.320 --> 55:18.240]  this is, you know, these are some incredible allegations you're making here. I was reading
[55:18.240 --> 55:24.520]  out of the Detroit news where the State Department said they were ordered to let him on the plane
[55:24.520 --> 55:30.160]  and had a government person lead him on to the plane without passport. I was reading
[55:30.160 --> 55:36.920]  Operation Northwoods from ABC News. I was covering Gulf of Tonkin that any senior in high school
[55:36.920 --> 55:41.360]  should know is a staged event. That's been admitted for years. And she just says it's
[55:41.360 --> 55:46.200]  outrageous, but Geraldo says no, actually that's true because he knows that his audience
[55:46.200 --> 55:51.480]  may be intelligent and we'll understand that's a lie. Let's continue on with this. The plane
[55:51.480 --> 55:58.640]  crash with Joe Stack on the tea parties. Back up a second and just take a deep breath.
[55:58.640 --> 56:04.800]  Why would he attack the Pentagon? What aspect of his life would make him manifested with
[56:04.800 --> 56:09.800]  that kind of violence against the Defense Department establishment? Why? Why there?
[56:09.800 --> 56:19.200]  Here's Fox News. Here's Fox News. Here's Fox News. His parents two weeks before warned
[56:19.200 --> 56:22.800]  the government nothing was done. Same thing with the Fort Hood shooter. Same thing with
[56:22.800 --> 56:26.960]  the underwear bomber. I mean, the guy was obviously a complete lunatic. I mean, look
[56:26.960 --> 56:31.760]  at video of the guy. He looks like he's a nut from central casting. He obviously had
[56:31.760 --> 56:36.840]  millions of screws loose here. Okay. I mean, maybe he was a lone nut. Maybe he was. The
[56:36.840 --> 56:42.360]  point is to try to within one hour demonize 9 11 truth. This stinks to high heaven. That's
[56:42.360 --> 56:46.720]  what we cover in info wars.com are all doing. I'm glad you covered this. Okay. Okay, Alex
[56:46.720 --> 56:50.920]  will will continue to stay in touch. Kimberly. Thank you. See you tomorrow night. Okay. That's
[56:50.920 --> 56:55.760]  it for us. Thanks for watching. We'll see you hopefully tomorrow night too. Good night.
[56:55.760 --> 57:01.280]  Okay, we're going to come back in the next hour, open the phones up, continue discussing
[57:01.280 --> 57:07.280]  this go over more points. Some key information I haven't gotten to yet. They had a drill
[57:07.280 --> 57:13.480]  of a similar attack. The week before this, I'll explain why they always use drills to
[57:13.480 --> 57:19.840]  cover up their real operations. Also Adam Goddan, the grandson of an ADO board member
[57:19.840 --> 57:24.440]  who's been caught putting out fake al-qaeda videos is put out a support video for all
[57:24.440 --> 57:30.000]  this to make it look like al-qaeda is real on a CIA creation. And oh my gosh, the 9 11
[57:30.000 --> 57:35.440]  truthers, they work for al-qaeda. And of course, they've been caught at the Intel Center uploading
[57:35.440 --> 57:41.040]  al-qaeda videos in the same video layer with their logo as the al-qaeda video showing that
[57:41.040 --> 57:45.440]  they're producing these videos and wired magazine has reported on that. We'll be back with the
[57:45.440 --> 57:52.720]  second hour. You don't want to miss this information. Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get
[57:52.720 --> 57:57.640]  food. Well, here's an unbelievable chance for you to jumpstart your food savings plan

[58:12.960 --> 58:19.200]  of food free. That's buy three, get one free. They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[58:19.200 --> 58:23.880]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food passing the savings

[58:57.600 --> 59:19.560]  unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.

[59:51.200 --> 59:57.920]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Astro's Grand Casting Network.
[59:57.920 --> 01:00:05.240]  I made it and I love it. Ain't America?
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:12.200]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:23.640]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:39.720]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live hour number two. Coming up in the next
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:44.360]  segment, I'm going to continue breaking down all the evidence of this being a false flag.
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:48.800]  But right now, let's go to your calls, John, in New York. You're on the air.
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:54.040]  Hello, Alex. Great honor. First time long time at all that radio talk. Hey, did you
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:01:00.600]  hear that Adam Gadan got arrested today? They're claiming that Gadan, the ADL front,
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:07.480]  got arrested. It was on Frederica on CNN in the middle
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:14.160]  of the afternoon. And before I turn WWCR on, I heard it on BBC Shortwave Radio.
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:17.680]  Guys, will you Google Adam Gadan, American Al Qaeda, arrested?
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:22.480]  It was on Frederica on the CNN today.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:28.360]  Jaren's nodding. Jaren, Jaren, you, it's in my stack. Wow. Okay. I'll find it then. Or
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:32.840]  during the break, the guys bring me a stack in that they separately print. And I hadn't
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:39.240]  seen that. Wow. Because we know this guy is a front. We know it's fake. And it actually
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:42.440]  came out several times as you get Watson run article about this, where they would arrest
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:49.600]  Al Qaeda commanders. And then two years later, they would then report that it had been a
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:54.920]  staged arrest to, so they wouldn't blow their cover. Yeah, there it is. Los Angeles Times.
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:02:00.680]  Adam Gadan, Al Qaeda agent from Southern California is arrested in Pakistan. So I guess it got
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:05.200]  so damaging for him that we've been exposing. I mean, it came out in Wired magazine with
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:10.200]  these Al Qaeda videos were being uploaded in the same video layer as the Intel Center's
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:16.320]  logo and the Intel Center's run by Rumsfeld, former Black Ops commanders. What do you think
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:21.920]  is going on, John? Excuse me? What do you think is going on?
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:29.320]  I don't know. They, the official thing they said he was arrested for treason. And basically
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:37.120]  this guy's being passed off is this generation's Tokyo Rose. And Alex, I don't know what to
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:43.080]  make of certain issues anymore, but I always try like heck to find out what's going on.
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:49.320]  And I know that a lot of things on your show are true because local versions of it happen
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:54.080]  in my town all the time. And I'll let the other callers on. I just wanted to let you
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:58.040]  know about Gadan's arrest. Thank you, John. The guys tried to let me know. I just got
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:01.520]  here a bit late today and I do my own news research and then tend to look through the
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:06.160]  stacks they give me. So I'm sorry. I didn't know about that. That is a big development.
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:09.040]  Let's talk to Dave and Mass. You're on the air, Dave.
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:13.960]  Hi, Alex. Love the show. Thank you. What's on your mind?
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:18.040]  I don't understand. The thing I don't understand about the Adam Gadan thing now, he was the
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:23.760]  grandson of the founder of the ADL. Is that right? And his real name was Adam Perlman.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:29.240]  Yeah. Well, he was one of one of the top founding board members. Yes. Is he related to your
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:34.720]  wife? They're both Jewish. Well, my wife's not Jewish. My wife's a Christian. And the
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:41.520]  big secret in this religion of freaking out everything Jewish and obsessing over it. My
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:47.920]  my wife's grandfather was Jewish and was a doctor and met her grandmother in Texas.
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:54.640]  Who's a nurse? And I've talked about that and I've talked about how I'm part Native American
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:04:00.640]  in the same sentence and people act like it's some big secret. And then it's mental illness.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:05.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, people say I'm Jewish and it wouldn't be bad if I was, but I'm not.
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:14.600]  I'm not. I'm Scotch and English and German and French and Heinz 57 Anglo-Saxon. And I
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:19.120]  mean, what if my wife was Jewish? I mean, she's not. But I mean, that'd be okay. It's the
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:29.240]  information I cover that matters. See, I criticize Israel and the things Israel does. But I don't
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:34.880]  like the crowds that hate Jews all day because I found there a bunch of mentally ill liars
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:41.520]  who exaggerate and make up a bunch of stuff. Okay. But whatever, man, I'm here trying to
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:46.960]  wake people up to the new world order. And that's what we're doing. But I understand it's, it's,
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:55.760]  it's exponential existential envy where anybody who's successful in anything,
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:58.480]  losers like you hate them. So I feel sorry for you, bro.
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:06.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.680]  to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:17.840]  Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress. And they really are
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:24.000]  calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:30.160]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:34.960]  on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes, constructing world government. Tim Geithner,
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:39.280]  Bernanke, their arsonists, they're asking for more matches. And the Congress is saying,
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:43.920]  who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington,
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:52.800]  DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com

[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:06.080]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:14.160]  a war on for your mind. Now I'll make another prediction. I predict that very soon,
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:21.600]  Obama will create a crisis along the lines of the Reichstag fire. I don't know what form it will
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:27.520]  take. But I believe that once the minions are seen for what they are, Ramamanyuel and his gang
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:32.400]  will set off a Reichstag fire in this country of some kind. And they will recall the military
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:37.680]  dictatorship of Lincoln and Stanton during the civil war when civil civilian suspects were arrested
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:43.040]  without warrant. I will tell you as I sit here, I fear that every night as I go to sleep, I put
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:48.400]  nothing past these agitators who have suddenly seized. Now again, there's Michael Savage agreeing
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:55.680]  with me. Because as the political agenda of the globalist falls apart, they are going to stage
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:07:02.640]  events or allow lone nuts to attack. And it's confirmed that terror suspect kept visa to avoid
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:06.640]  tipping off larger investigation. They let him on the plane with the underwear bombing,
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:14.080]  Pentagon shooter John Bedell's parents warned cops two weeks before. It's the same case over
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:22.400]  and over and over again. And how many shows, how many broadcasts, how many times did I tell you
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:27.040]  that they were going to stage terror attacks and blame the tea parties, burthers and truthers,
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:30.320]  anybody that doesn't buy the government's official stories.
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:37.760]  Now, I don't know what's going on with Adam Perlman slash Adam Goodon, American Al Qaeda.
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:42.960]  They've now reported that he was arrested in Pakistan and is being charged with treason.
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:48.480]  I've seen multiple mainstream news articles the last six years where over and over again,
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:53.920]  fake Al Qaeda is arrested. They'll hold them for a few years and then quietly release them,
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:08:00.560]  saying that that was their cover for being a government operative. Now, I know Adam Goodon
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:06.480]  has been uploaded with other videos by the Intel Center and others in the same video layer,
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:13.760]  meaning the same video version. You take one video that has an Al Qaeda logo on it and put
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:18.640]  your logo like Intel Center on it run by two guys that formerly worked in black ops for the CIA
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:24.160]  and Donald Rumsfeld. And it was Wired Magazine reported this three years ago that the logo
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:30.960]  of the Intel Center was in the same video layer as the Al Qaeda logo, meaning they produced it.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.440]  The issue here is we know those were fake bin Laden tapes. That's been confirmed. The video
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:41.600]  tapes, they were, they were either old tapes reedited or in some cases completely fake,
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:46.880]  not even the same person. Fake audio tapes. Every few weeks, you'll see an AP article,
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:50.640]  Al Qaeda threatens to attack bin Laden threatens to attack and they'll say at the bottom of the
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:56.080]  article, this was from a message board and cannot be authenticated. Remember five years ago, the
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:00.880]  fake beheading in San Francisco where a guy should have fake beheading in his garage and the media
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:06.960]  ran with it like it was real. This is all done to create the perception that we've got all these
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:12.080]  enemies threatening us, but then you get the internal Homeland Security, MyAC reports and it
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:16.800]  states Homeland Security and Northcom are really for the American people. I want to go back to your
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:24.800]  calls, but I want to break down why Fox News had me on. They had me on because this is a good chance
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:29.680]  to have me on and say, well, 9 11 truth are you're discredited now, aren't you?
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:36.560]  As if the information of 9 11 truth is discredited because some guy has hundreds of
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:41.600]  beliefs. If you even believe the official story and might have been a 9 11 truth or
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:46.480]  see how the media is all over that and we predicted that would happen.
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:53.840]  Again, 36 to 84% of the American people, depending on which scientific poll you look at,
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:57.120]  Angus and Reed, CNN, both 83 and 84 respectively,
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:02.160]  they had Scripps Howard, new service poll four years ago, 36% believe the government did it.
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:07.920]  Are they all terrorists now? See, they've got a problem because more Americans continue to
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:14.000]  learn about 9 11 and all the serious inconsistencies and the things that happen like drills of the
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:23.040]  same targets being attacked at the same time on 9 11. That's mainstream news 7 7 in London in 2005,
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:28.720]  exact same targets attacked at the exact same time exact same place. That's BBC and it news.
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:35.600]  The head of the drill program visor consultancy, former head of Scotland yard PR,
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:39.760]  Peter power came out and said very strange. We're running drills the exact same bus,
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:46.400]  exact same trains exact same times one out of 23 tractor Gillian billions of times all the grains
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:51.280]  of sand in the world. Why do they do drills? Well, they go hire a company or a government
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:56.320]  group to do a drill, not that they're involved so that when NSA and info pole nine and echelon
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:00.960]  systems are listening to cell phones, tracking emails, good parts of the government that are
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:06.480]  compartmentalized and not involved. If they learn about the real operation being run,
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:12.560]  they don't go bust it because they're told that's just a drill. It creates decoys or a smoke screen
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:20.160]  and a lot of times they fund the terror attacks through the drill as a bootleg. So that's going
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:27.200]  on. Again, the parents warned there was a Pentagon DC subway drill of the exact same type attack
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:34.160]  going on the week before source on that is the Washington Post. Here's another one Al Qaeda video
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:39.920]  calling for attacks on us arrives days after Pentagon shooting Kurt Nemo info wars dot com
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:47.040]  right on time. And it goes on and on remember who set up Al Qaeda. This is on record 1979 US
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:54.960]  government. Set it up. Zbigniew Brzezinski has written articles bragging, bragging about how
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:12:02.960]  they did that. So this guy was sending letters to the Pentagon about nanotech inventions.
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:08.000]  He was mad about pot laws and being arrested. He was a manic depressant on drugs. He was against
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.040]  the war. He was a libertarian. He was a Democrat supported Gravel Congressman.
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:20.960]  He liked the Von Mies Austrian School of Economics. The media is demonizing Von Mies
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.440]  and economists as if they're involved in violence now. Just any group, the establishment doesn't
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:35.360]  like this guy's the perfect patsy and his family warned, but nothing was done. I'm going to go
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:39.280]  ahead and go to a few calls or come back from break and continue with calls. But this is so
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:41.920]  important. What's happening because coming up before the end of the show, I'm going to cover
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:46.000]  some other news, but then I'm going to get into what this means in the future and my predictions
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.880]  for the future, why the establishment is doing this and what this means because there's no doubt
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:55.440]  that this is staged at some level. Bare minimum. They let the guy do it. Scott in Washington,
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:13:01.840]  you're on the air. Yeah, a couple of things I wanted to mention. Number one, remember when you
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:08.880]  had a pastor Williams on early last fall and you know, with all this stage step that's going on,
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:15.040]  you remember how he was saying about how the powers that be were dissatisfied with Obama and
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:20.400]  he had better watch his step. And then you had announced about a month ago that you had a feeling
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:26.080]  that they might try something against Obama. You think maybe that this is what he was talking
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:31.200]  about. Cause when he first said that, you know, to me, it kind of was like, well, it seems like
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:34.320]  he's doing everything that they want him to do. So I, you know,
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:38.560]  that's right. Chaplin Williams worked with some of the biggest oil companies in the world and his
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:44.000]  predictions have come true, unfortunately. And he said when we were at $50 a barrel that it
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.040]  go up to 150 the next year, that happened from Bilderberg sources. We got the same Intel from
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:56.720]  Bilderberg 2008. And he said that the elites may use Obama as a sacrificial lamb. And then
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:02.640]  in amongst all this 9 11 truth, birther tea party demonization, I've seen the talking point on the
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:12.480]  news that 9 11 truthers want to kill Obama. And I mean, how crazy is that? And so they're
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:17.520]  preconditioning with the riots that'll come. If that does happen, that it's going to be 9 11
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:22.880]  truths fault. And that's all part of what I've been warning people about before this violence
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:27.760]  started. The media was saying it was going to happen with no evidence and no history of it.
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:34.000]  So, but also knowing how mass psychology works. I've studied it and the establishment knows
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.200]  even more about this by constantly hyping that 9 11 truthers are going to try to kill Obama
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:44.160]  or going to attack military bases. There are some weak minded people. And I said this a month ago,
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:50.480]  who will get the idea in their head from that. And this guy was clearly borderline schizo
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:56.240]  and go and do it on their own. I use as an example last Wednesday before two days before
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:02.080]  this or day before this even happened that police departments know that when one person
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:07.280]  jumps off a big building in Chicago or New York or LA that other people hear about it and normally
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:11.920]  try to go jump off the very same building in the next few days. So they'll advise building owners
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:19.280]  to lock those viewing platforms for a week or so because copycats go. Yeah, that guy jumped off.
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:24.480]  I'm going to go jump off. And so either way you cut it, why would the media out of the blue from
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:30.640]  MSNBC to Fox to the Southern Prairie Law Center say that 9 11 truth and birthers, two totally
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:36.000]  separate groups are going to try to go after the government and go after Obama. I mean,
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:42.240]  that's pretty suspicious, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, it is. And the second thing that I wanted to mention
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:49.120]  real quick, and it sort of ties into this whole thing that debacle with Deborah Medina should be
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:55.120]  a lesson to those who trust Glenn Beck and believe all of that will all these meal cons to say that
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:59.520]  these are the same people that will touch you in the throat. I hear you. We got to go. We got to go.
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:06.080]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones. And I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.

[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.560]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:09.760]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two,
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:14.640]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:20.320]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:25.280]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:30.720]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:35.200]  a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:40.320]  onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:44.400]  mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:50.320]  one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's

[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:20.480]  We've got about 40 minutes left in broadcast. I want to get into some news separate from the
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:27.280]  Pentagon shooting. Coming up, let's continue with your phone calls right now. Let's talk
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:33.520]  to Sam in Florida. Sam, you're on the air. Hi, Alex. I just wanted to just make a comment
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:38.400]  to you real quick and then just a quick question. One, are you aware that the Motorola Android
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:42.160]  telephone, because I hear you talking about the iPhone all the time for the iPhone app,
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:49.840]  the iPod. You're aware that it's also available for the Motorola Android telephone. I listen to
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:54.720]  the daily streaming audio right across my telephone. Well, Sam, you can hear us pretty
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:59.840]  much on any cell phone through the flycast feature that we have linked in the listen page
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:04.400]  of infowars.com. If you go to the right hand or left hand corner, there's a whole listen page
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:10.000]  with the podcast, the audio streams, the free iPhone app. This is our first venture. We paid
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:15.120]  for the app, got it developed, launched it. It's gotten 25,000 sign ups in the last three and a
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:20.800]  half weeks, people getting the free iPhone app. And yes, we're working on an Android app right
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:27.280]  now. We're a small operation, but yes, we are deploying all of these systems. We're also working
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:32.240]  on a prisonplanet.tv app for prisonplanet.tv members. So we're doing everything we can.
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:37.600]  Good deal. The other question I had for you, the other day when you had Philip Berg on live,
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:41.280]  I tried my crazy to get in there, talk to him, but the phone line for Jim,
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:47.520]  I was close. Maybe I was sleeping on the episode or whatever, but did he ever say where he was at
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:52.000]  with the birth or issue and the court case against Obama?
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.640]  Some of his cases have been thrown out. Some are still in court. I appreciate your call.
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:02.640]  Phil Berg, the founder of the Berther movement. Let's go ahead and talk to CES in Florida. CES,
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:09.120]  you're on the air. Yeah, hi, Alex. It's good to talk with you. I really appreciate your service
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:17.360]  to the nation. My question is, I wanted to start an online business and I just wanted to get some
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:24.160]  advice from you on what hosting services and domain providers I should use. Well, I appreciate your
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:30.240]  call CES, but I got a couple IT people and consultants and trial and error. We've used a
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:34.800]  lot of different systems, but I would go out and just look at reviews and pick for yourself,
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:39.200]  but you probably won't need to pick a platform at first because you won't be getting that much
[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:45.520]  traffic. But we use CDNs and multiple server systems. My bandwidth build is in excess of
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:51.440]  $30,000 a month, but we get, what is it, 4 million individual visitors a week now?
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:57.360]  I mean, it's, it's, it's insane. So I don't think you'll probably ever have that problem.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:02.320]  But let's go to Leo in Texas. Leo, you're on the air.
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:08.880]  How you doing, Alex? Good. Listen, really quickly, I just wanted to let you know that I've been a
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:16.320]  victim of a coin tell pro. I was on my Facebook recently and had a friend at a local airport
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:24.880]  and they had put up a story required or a story regarding the 11 airports, new airports and body
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:31.440]  standards. Yes. Well, I put a story link regarding your body standards that pretty much are the,
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:38.080]  show the naked body image of fully color. Well, I posted some of the text regarding that story as
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:44.160]  well as the link. And later on the, another person commented and pretty much put me on the spot.
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:50.160]  I can read it to you for verbatim speaking here. Well, I mean, no, but I mean, I appreciate your call,
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:56.800]  Leo. There are a lot of trolls out there too. It's not just government, but the government admits
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:00.640]  they're now setting up the sensor of the internet. That's a wired magazine headline,
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:05.680]  cyber security bill, the end of the open internet. I mean, we've been covering the
[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:10.560]  bill here on air at nauseam. People are finally reading the bill and they're saying they want
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:16.880]  a sensor, they want to control White House Cass Sunstein regulations are says they want to infiltrate
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:21.840]  911 truth groups and others and try to get them to commit violence as a way to shut them down.
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:26.320]  That's another reason I knew all these staged events were coming. We have the White House
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:32.320]  documents that they're doing this and look who's working with them. Fox, MSNBC, all of them.
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:38.720]  It's disgusting. Ronnie in Texas. You're on the air. Thank you, sir. I love Jews and I
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:44.720]  dislike Zionism because I think it hijacked Judaism 150 years ago. So I say 911 wasn't
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:52.080]  inside outside job, just like the USS Liberty attempt to sink the USS Liberty with JF with
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:57.440]  the LBJ's coverup and the JFK assassination with at least McNamara's involvement. He chose
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:02.960]  the Dealey Plaza route, for example, and they pulled the secret service off. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:10.560]  asking you, sir, please just don't don't just don't leave out Israeli involvement in these things
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:16.880]  because it's, you know, facing reality about Zionist hijacked Israel is crucial to our national
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:24.480]  survival and well, Ronnie Ronnie. Yeah. Folks didn't hear it earlier. A caller called in
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:30.400]  and was basically implying I cover stuff up for Israel and you're calling too. And I appreciate
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:38.320]  your call. Look, I just don't obsess over Israel all day. I made a film exposing the USS Liberty
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:43.440]  attack terror storm, a history of government sponsored terror. And that's about 10 minutes of
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:47.520]  the film as it goes through all these different examples. And I went off of what the admirals
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:51.600]  told me what the court records showed. And then two years after that film was released,
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:57.360]  it was declassified that I was correct. And I explained Israel and our government work together.
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:05.760]  And all the Looney Tune and a semi said I was covering up for Israel. It's mental illness.
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:12.160]  Well, listen, Ronnie, I appreciate your call. Okay. My point is, is that I expose stuff,
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:17.680]  but I don't do it in a hateful way. I'm fair when the British states terror, I expose it.
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:22.160]  And then I don't say British people are evil. When our government stages stuff, I point out
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:28.560]  it's a minority group in our government doing Israel. I mean, I made films six, seven years ago
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:34.160]  exposing mainstream news articles. Israel creates fake al Qaeda groups to screw up the peace process.
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:35.840]  You know, that was in the Jerusalem post.
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:43.120]  Look, all of the anti-Semitic groups, most of them are federally run. And I told you how
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:50.400]  Turner was a Fed. It's now in federal court. He is. And so the thing is they don't, the
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:57.440]  establishment doesn't want legitimate criticism of Israel, even handed focused criticism.
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:03.600]  They want to radicalize it and make it crazy. And all the anti-Semites and Nazis do is fight
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:11.360]  with each other and run around crazy, making up stuff. And so I don't like those groups. And
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:17.760]  I have experienced all their lies for myself and their deception because I'm here
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:23.520]  covering bad things. Israel does. I think all these big governments are bad. History shows that.
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:28.800]  And there is this obsession with Israel. There's also other camps that obsess on the Vatican.
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:33.040]  And all they talk about is the Vatican, how the Vatican runs everything. The Vatican's got a lot
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:37.680]  of corruption, a lot of problems. And we talk about it, but it's not a Catholic bashing fest.
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:43.600]  See, when you criticize the Vatican calling for world government, but do it in an even-handed
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:47.840]  manner, then Catholics don't like what's happening and others don't. And we can stop it. When you
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:56.320]  criticize bad things, Israel's doing. You can stop it. I remember in 98, 99 CNN pieces going,
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:04.080]  all the criticism of China. Is it anti-Asian? No. Chinese generals were in the White House
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:11.200]  paying off Bill Clinton to get missile secrets and to sell our nation out. And the media tried to
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:16.560]  make it a racial issue. No, it's a foreign, powerful government trying to expand its power.
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:21.920]  And Bill Clinton was engaged in treason. But the media tried to make it a racial issue.
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:29.920]  It's the same thing with healthcare. The talking point that, well, if you don't like the government
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:35.600]  healthcare, that's code word for not liking black people. Remember Chris Matthews and Carlos Watson
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:46.000]  and all of them. See, that's the FBI playbook is to make any criticism of any government so
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:53.440]  ridiculously hateful that mainline people stay polarized. Okay? The feds run the radical white
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:29:01.440]  supremacist groups and that's why they hate me. Period. Because I expose them. One major world
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:07.760]  crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system. The main event is the wholesale destruction
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:13.040]  of the world. The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:08.080]  buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple
[01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:13.360]  your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:18.400]  company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:23.520]  smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:28.720]  dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:33.920]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands of families
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:38.480]  lose their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:43.040]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:47.280]  offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information

[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:28.320]  It is the seventh day of March on this Sunday edition, 2010. If you want to watch
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:35.680]  unedited in its entirety, my interview when I was on Fox News last night with Geraldo Rivera
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:41.040]  and his attempt to demonize 9-11-Truth and tie it to the supposed shooting at the Pentagon
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:46.880]  Thursday night, you can go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com. It's still at the top of the
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:53.040]  page at prisonplanet.com. Alex Jones on Geraldo, media sought to demonize 9-11-Truth with Pentagon
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:59.520]  incident link. And you can read all the latest news and the evidence of this there. But no one
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:05.120]  can deny that I have documented literally hundreds of times the last few months that they're putting
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:11.920]  out the preconditioning preparation talking points that 9-11-Truth, the birthers, libertarians,
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:17.920]  conservatives, gun owners, the Tea Party people are going to stage terror attacks. And you've
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:22.080]  heard Michael Savage pick up on this. He's not stupid. He's recognized it and said they're
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:26.640]  getting ready to stage something. Okay? I mean, if you understand politics when they're out
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:31.840]  everywhere with the talking point that all these groups are going to stage something when no one
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:37.200]  had done anything and then suddenly planes start flying into buildings and shootings start happening
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:41.120]  and you've got a government that's been caught hundreds of times in the past staging terror
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:48.320]  attacks and other events, something is wrong. It's called problem reaction solution, stage
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:55.760]  terror, false flag, self-inflicted wounds, frame ups. This is in army field manuals. This is
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:35:01.760]  declassified. They've done it hundreds of times. This is the reality. Now, I want to talk about
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:06.640]  the future and what I believe is coming up before the show ends. I've got some other positive news.
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:11.440]  I want to hit on some really good things happening in the U.S. and in Iceland and the Iceland ties
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:16.560]  into Greece and the whole banking situation before we end the show. But I'm going to talk to Walter,
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:21.120]  Rick, Juan, Dan, James, Barry, Matt, Eric, and Brian. That'll be it for calls, but I can only
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:25.200]  give each caller about 45 seconds. Okay? So Walter in Virginia, you're on the air.
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:31.680]  Hello, Mr. Jones. This might be old news, but here in Owl White County, Virginia,
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:37.600]  the county has come up with a creative way of collecting back taxes. They've contracted a company
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:49.520]  to steal your car. Amazing. They have scanners. They go through a grocery store parking lot
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:57.840]  and they don't even have to point it. They just drive by and they're hooked in with the DMV records
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:04.640]  and the scanner just pops up a license plate and they identify the car.
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:07.920]  Yeah. No, I've seen these articles. I didn't know about your county,
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:10.080]  but do you have the headline of the article?
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:16.240]  I don't. It's in the Smithfield Times in Owl White County, Virginia.
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:20.160]  Do you remember the basic headline from the Smithfield Times?
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:27.360]  County sees his cars for back taxes.
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:35.120]  Yeah. Yeah. Okay, guys, look that up. I mean, listen, Pentagon 20 years ago nationwide,
[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:39.680]  the Pentagon built the highways, designed it as a control grid in the 50s and 60s under
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:44.960]  Eisenhower. That's declassified. License plate reading cameras now are used for toll roads.
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:51.360]  They're scanning you on regular roads. And yes, the police or anybody, including repo men,
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:56.720]  drive around with these license plate readers that 360 can read hundreds of cars a second.
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:02.560]  They read the plates. The computer recognizes the numbers and it's a total control grid.
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:07.040]  It's absolutely horrible. This is what big brother is being used for. But let's say you even paid
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:13.680]  your taxes and we go into a police state. They come after you. I've had friends who as a test
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:18.160]  had warrants out and every time a cop car would drive by and we know some Austin police cars have
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:22.320]  this, they would pull them over and arrest them. Well, they just put Mexican plates on their car.
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:29.360]  They're just fine. I know one guy did that. And that's why 800 plus cities, illegal aliens are
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:34.400]  above the law. They're just left alone. But I appreciate your call, Walter. Rich in Pennsylvania,
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:40.720]  you're on the air. Alex, I have to thank you using Christ and use my God that really awakened
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:46.240]  and transformed myself. I have a question and a point real quick. I passed out a bunch of copies
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:51.920]  this fall. The Republic of my church, everybody loved it. They want volume to most admit that
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:56.720]  there's a tyranny out there, but they're just still apathetic to it. So I wanted to organize
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:01.600]  a little wake up like survival guide class at the church there. Where can I get all these
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:06.720]  be classified documents? Where can I go to print them all out before the internet collapses?
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:12.880]  Okay. Okay. Most of my films and we're so busy in such a small operation. Listeners do this.
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:18.880]  Three different men have done this and one woman and we check it and they're always librarians or
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:25.120]  researchers and do a great job. Fans have made what is the end game.com. Well, we made the site.
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:32.320]  They sent us the info and we looked at it was accurate. A full bibliography of what is the end
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:38.160]  game, my film end game. There's a full bibliography for every minute of the film, every document,
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:44.560]  every video clip, every news article at what is the end game.com. Marshall law 911.info,
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:49.040]  make sure that site's still up. I haven't looked at it in about a year. Marshall law 911.info,
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:54.000]  full bibliography for my three hour film, Marshall law, the Obama deception website,
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:01.840]  fall, the republic.com. They both have bibliographies. But I mean, I'm here,
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:08.080]  you know, let's say I read Operation Northwoods, just put Operation Northwoods in into a search
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:15.120]  engine. And one of the top 10 links is the national security archives. You can go print it off the
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:22.560]  US government's own website. So, or if I read a Detroit free press article about how the state
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:27.440]  department was ordered to let the underwear bomber on the plane and helped him get on. I mean, I gave
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:32.720]  you the headline. I mean, terror suspect kept visa to avoid tipping off larger investigation.
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:37.680]  Or if I read a army field manual, you can just write down what I say on air and then pull it
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:44.880]  up for yourself. Army field manual, US special forces counterinsurgency manual FM 31 dash 20 dash
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:50.160]  three. And you can also read articles, mainstream articles about my gosh, look at this army
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:54.480]  manual how to stage terror attacks. But I appreciate your call. Good to hear you one in
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:40:02.000]  New York. You're on the air. Go ahead. Oh, well, Alex, first time. I just want to thank God for
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:08.240]  you being a voice to the world and waking up as many people as possible. That's what I'm trying
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:15.040]  to do in New York. Wherever I go, my car runs an alternative energy. I want people to know that.
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:21.280]  And I want your people to let you know that I can have that whole facility in your cars running
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:26.400]  on clean energy. You can be off the grid and I cannot discuss those things over the phone with
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:31.840]  you. You guys can call me. I will give you my phone number. If I don't, if I can do that in
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:37.840]  the air or one, send us an email, send it to show tips and info wars.com. There's a lot of
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:42.240]  alternative energy being suppressed or never getting the funding to go mainstream. I've seen a
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:47.440]  lot of evidence of that. Send us your info. Let's talk to Dan in Texas. Dan, you're on the air.
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:54.000]  Yeah, Alex, I just had a real quick question as pertaining to the general salante prediction.
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:41:01.920]  Yes, you had him on the show. Yeah, we all know his predictions are pretty spot on. And he
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:09.360]  mentioned Obama being urged into the Iran possibly going to war with Iran.
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:14.240]  Yeah, and Israel and they is saying they're going to probably attack them and they're moving forces
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:19.120]  into the area. Yeah, I just wanted to get your feedback. I guess I'm going to talk to Jerry,
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:26.320]  but would you even feel comfortable saying that this can actually possibly turn into thermal
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:33.680]  nuclear war, World War III? Most analysts say it could potentially trigger World War III. It'll
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:39.040]  bare minimum triple the price of oil for a few months. And Iran will watch counter attacks.
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:45.680]  That will be called terrorism, you know, any response. And again, they're pushing them into
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:50.480]  a corner and they're doing this so they can have a political excuse to rob us through the banking
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:55.600]  system set up a police state here domestically. It's very serious, Dan. I appreciate your call.
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:42:03.280]  Yes, it could lead to war with China with Russia. Very serious. James in Canada, you're on the air.
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:09.760]  Oh, hi, Alex. Basically, I just wanted to say about the Pentagon shooting. I mean,
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:15.440]  this was, they got notice of this two weeks before nothing happened. I mean, what is the
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:21.120]  point of all these civil liberties eroding laws? I mean, in the UK, we've got like CCTV cameras
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:27.120]  everywhere. You've got local government like having child spies, the terrorism act. In the USA,
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:32.960]  you've got the Patriot Act. And it only gets worse, but it's worse than that. In many cases,
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:40.320]  stay there. I'm going to come back to you, James. It gets worse than that. We have all these cases
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:45.520]  where in the case of the underwear bomber on Christmas Day, they knew his father had warned
[01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:48.960]  he wasn't going to be allowed to fly and the State Department sends somebody there
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:55.520]  with a passport without a passport to get him on the plane. So they don't just ignore the warnings
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:59.680]  in every case. They enable it when it is a lone nut. We'll be right back.
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:05.920]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food. Well, here's an unbelievable chance for you to

[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:08.480]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road. But if the unfortunate
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:16.640]  happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets. There's a place down in Tennessee where
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:26.800]  they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They're so bright in every stitch guarantee you love the way
[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:36.480]  they fit. They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most. Blue diamond gussets
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:44.480]  got it, others don't. We turned jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:50.320]  unparalleled quality. Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:57.840]  so you could ride all day with confidence. Order yours at gusset.com. Diamond gusset jeans got it,
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:05.440]  others don't. Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:10.160]  This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:14.880]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I've turned a tremendous
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:21.200]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:27.120]  upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:32.720]  enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell bent on destroying sovereignty,
[01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:37.680]  and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:42.000]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to? Today
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:48.800]  seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:55.520]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now

[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:14.080]  deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:19.280]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:24.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:30.720]  nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:36.640]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products. You can now produce pure
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:42.000]  and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator. Very easy to follow step by
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:49.680]  step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple. Go to www.silverlungs.com today

[01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:56.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:29.440]  Well folks, they claim that they had arrested Adam Gadon who we've documented as a government
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:35.040]  agent putting out fake Al Qaeda videos and I said it's probably a staged arrest and later
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:40.560]  they'll say it's fake or that he was really a government agent. Here's CBS News, US-born Al Qaeda
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:46.560]  arrest news incorrect, confusion over militants, identity sparks reports of Gadon's arrest,
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:53.360]  some media say it's another US-born terrorist, FBI says it hasn't confirmed arrest of Adam Gadon.
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:48:02.000]  If you Google Airlift of Evil you'll have Times of London Associated Press where tens of thousands
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:08.160]  of Al Qaeda commanders and Taliban commanders were arrested by the military when they took over
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:14.640]  Afghanistan in early 2002 and they were ordered to release them. Now they had the former CIA
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:18.960]  Black Ops commander who wrote the book Job Breaker on to talk about it. They were only allowed to
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:24.320]  arrest innocent people normally with a fake bounty to the Taliban. They grabbed some 14-year-old kid,
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:29.920]  sent them to Camp Gitmo or other camps to be tortured. They didn't give fake confessions
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:34.080]  and here it is. Looks like another fake one kind of like three weeks ago. They said,
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:38.240]  oh we caught the number two in the Taliban and turned out that was fake. It's Psyops but they
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:42.800]  know the big announcement gets made it's real and then later it's fake but we don't know yet on this
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:46.560]  we're watching it. Okay I want to finish up with James and I got to hit news. We may get to some
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:52.640]  more callers after that. James in Canada made a great point. Anything else? I mean yeah in every
[01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:57.040]  case the government protects them or ignores the warnings and then we get the internal government
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:02.160]  documents. The whole Homeland Security system is for the American people. It's just that. I mean
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:07.040]  people just aren't waking up to it. It's part of the reason Canada actually moved from the UK
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:13.280]  because everyone else is so apathetic to these laws to see this stuff just going around you all
[01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:19.040]  the time. I'm like how can you not see this is happening? How can you not realize how bad it's
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:24.000]  getting? You know police on the streets of the UK have been giving like portable fingerprints
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:29.280]  down. It's treating everyone like criminals. Oh oh I forgot to get to this Friday and today
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:35.120]  in San Diego if you want a skateboard you've got a biometrically scan with the police
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:39.360]  like you're a criminal. Talk about thumb scanning biometrically to buy and sell. I appreciate your
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:44.480]  call James. In fact pull that up before the show ends. Skateboarders must thumb scan or skateboarders
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:49.680]  must biometrically scan San Diego or skateboarders San Diego will pull it up in the news search.
[01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:56.320]  Folks I meant to get to this tomorrow. I'm going to cover it in detail. We already knew this. It's
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:50:01.520]  covered in Terror Storm. It's covered in Fall of the Republic. Whole sections in those films about
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:06.800]  60 years ago they knew how to mind control people through TV and through films and through radio.
[01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:15.760]  Here's MSNBC. Five surprising ways your TV is slowly killing you. It lowers your brain waves,
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:21.200]  puts you in a dreamlike state if you watch more than an hour a day. The average person watches
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:26.720]  four and a half hours of TV a day. Strangely enough the internet doesn't cause the same brainwave
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:31.520]  reduction because you're interactive but sitting there drooling in front of the TV
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:39.920]  makes you deader. Number one makes you drunker weakens your bones and then for some reason we
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:48.320]  didn't print. TV makes you less engaging. I'm going to cover in fact search this form right now
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:54.720]  while you're getting the skateboard. Search the term TV Alzheimer's. Hundreds of studies,
[01:50:54.720 --> 01:51:02.000]  prestigious research from major universities, massive increases in Alzheimer's. They've done
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:10.880]  autopsies of 92-year-old famous conductors or composers and their brains are shriveled and
[01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:17.120]  tiny in the size of a tennis ball but they were geniuses when they died because they stayed engaged.
[01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:23.200]  TV linked to Alzheimer's, PVC. There it is on screen. They know this and so why not just bring
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:28.400]  this up? Because the last caller, the Brit, talked about why don't people care? Why are they zombies?
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:33.120]  Because they are zombies. You've got those of us awake and then those that are just passively
[01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:37.840]  in suspended disbelief receiving all the brainwashing from the government and the media.
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:44.240]  Now I'm going to cover this tomorrow in more detail. Print me those Alzheimer's articles. Did
[01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:50.080]  you find the skateboarders, San Diego thumb printing? Skateboarders must have printed it.
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:54.240]  Burmese has it. Burmese is coming up by the way for three hours. If you don't have an MNFM,
[01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:57.360]  it will be on the internet, streamsandm4s.com. Continue with your calls.
[01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:05.520]  Iceland voters rejected repayment plan. We've had the main leader of their parliament fighting this.
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:10.320]  Jones-Dottier, she's going to be back on. We're setting her up right now.
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:15.840]  She predicted a month ago on air they would defeat it. They have been given 10 times conservatively
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:21.200]  the debt that the whole country's GDP produces each year. It was engineered by Goldman Sachs,
[01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:27.200]  JP Morgan on record, just like Greece and Spain. They don't owe the money and the people have
[01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:32.160]  rejected at the polls. They say, and they've used anti-terror laws, British banks and US banks
[01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:39.840]  and Dutch banks inside Iceland to grab people's bank accounts. Oh, the government's owes us this
[01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:44.080]  money. So we're going to grab your bank account. Well, what did we report on two weeks ago that
[01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:49.520]  Drudge Report even picked up? We just got it from the, it was a listener tip. That's where we get
[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:53.760]  a lot of our news that the Citibank website said, we're going to hold your money for seven days and,
[01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:57.920]  you know, and all this news of runs on banks and how they're preparing to devalue the currency.
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:02.320]  And then Drudge Report picked it up. They're gearing up for this everywhere. But if Iceland
[01:53:02.320 --> 01:53:08.080]  can say no, that sends shock waves through the system. Greece hasn't said no. They're going to
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:12.960]  pay all this fiat money they don't owe. The banks create all these derivatives, sell worthless
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:17.440]  derivatives to the government. Then they implode them by design that came out McClatchy newspapers
[01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:22.560]  three months ago, five part series. They got the internal emails and then the country goes under
[01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:27.920]  to the banks. So it's like a made off Ponzi scheme, but they tie it to your government instead of the
[01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:34.560]  Ponzi scheme people go into prison. They take your country over. And now Gordon Brown is announcing
[01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:40.720]  a bank of the world that we will pay all our taxes to in the next crises that's coming. We did
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:46.320]  find the skateboard article. Throw that back up on screen for folks where they make you thumb print
[01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:53.200]  to, to, to Rob Jacobson was telling me about San Diego. He was there a year ago and they scan
[01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:57.440]  your driver's license when you go in a bar and it projects it on the TVs around the bar. Just
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:54:02.720]  training you. You have no rights. You have no privacy like the naked body scanners. It's incredible.
[01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:11.440]  So Iceland voters reject repayment plan New York times. And then I had another article here
[01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:18.240]  about McCain. I'm trying to find it. McCain's big bill that they had that mimics the UN's Codex
[01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:23.840]  Alimentarius rules that Canada just put in where they're saying vitamins and minerals being sold
[01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:28.560]  in stores over the counter are illegal. You've got to get a prescription. He was trying to get a bill
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:37.040]  passed to do that. Here it is. McCain's draconian dietary supplement bill dead. Super news. The
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:44.480]  power of the people taking action yet again on that front. Here it is. Skateboarders will have
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:52.480]  to register to use city park biometrically thumb print to do that. And that's out of the NC times
[01:54:52.480 --> 01:55:01.280]  dot com. Okay, continuing with the news blitz here at the end of the broadcast. I meant to get to
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:04.480]  it Thursday. I meant to get to it Friday. I meant to get to today. I didn't, but I'm going to try
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:08.560]  to cover it tomorrow. But we got Max Kaiser and a bunch of other big guests on. We're going to try
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:13.840]  because these video clips from New York news and New Mexico news and other news around the
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:19.120]  country are incredible. The police have been caught all over the nation because their own
[01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:24.720]  officers are going public with the memorandums they're given on in paper in print that they will
[01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:30.320]  be fired or reprimanded if they don't increase the number of tickets and arrest, but then illegals
[01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:36.880]  are left alone in 800 plus cities that are sanctuary total discrimination. This is k o b
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:42.080]  dot com. Is there a quota system for New Mexico state police? And then they have the head of the
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:47.520]  state police saying, well, yes, they, you know, they've got to go out and do this, but it's not a
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:53.280]  quota. Then they read the definition of a quota. It is a quota. The point is there have been quotas
[01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:59.200]  for 50 years and the government lies more often than they tell the truth. And the police are
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:04.880]  trained by the government how to lie on the stand. And all over the country I see reports every day
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:09.440]  where police frame people or pull them over and take the money out of their wallet. I'm not saying
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:14.320]  all police individually are bad, but the government is training police how to be corrupt,
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:19.840]  training them how to lie, kicking good cops out and hiring corrupt police to replace them in the
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:23.760]  system. Now we've only got a minute left in the broadcast. I just want to say this here at the
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:28.480]  end and I'll cover it more tomorrow. All the articles are up at info wars dot com and prison
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:34.000]  planet dot com breaking down every angle of this. The globalist are getting ready to fully
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:38.960]  bankrupt the economy even further openly set up a world constitution where private banks run the
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:45.440]  planet. We knew this decades ago, but now it's declassified in public. They are going to stage
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:50.000]  terror attacks to demonize their opposition no matter who you are. This police state is for
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:55.280]  red blooded Americans. It's time to get off the bench. It's time to quit seeing yourself as a
[01:56:55.280 --> 01:57:01.920]  spectator and an active participant in this free society for your children for your own personal
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:08.480]  future for everything. You have to start envisioning yourself as a leader as someone who's going to go
[01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:12.880]  to city council, go to the state house who's going to call in to talk radio or start a blog
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:17.520]  or their own internet radio show. You've got to have your voice heard now. You can't count Alex
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:23.600]  Jones or Ron Paul or somebody else to save you. You have to do every little bit you can to wake
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:28.640]  up individuals. My films are a great way. Make copies of them on DVD, give them to people. They're
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:34.240]  waking folks up big time, biggest successful tool we've got. Get the DVDs at info wars dot com,
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:40.080]  the books, the videos, the materials. Get on the street. Get involved. People are waking up. The
[01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:44.960]  system is in trouble. There's an awakening happening but the globalists are sprinting to the finish.
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:58:05.200]  We've got to give 110 percent to defeat them. Great job crew. God bless you.
