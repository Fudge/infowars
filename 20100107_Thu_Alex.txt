[03:06.680 --> 03:12.120]  days it'll be a full year but eight months in he spent more than all
[03:12.120 --> 03:16.120]  presidents before him combined and still says he's balancing the budget still
[03:16.120 --> 03:22.280]  lies taking the public are a bunch of idiots he lied about everything and

[06:20.560 --> 06:25.960]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for

[08:01.000 --> 08:06.920]  closed doors but bringing all parties together and broadcasting those negotiations
[08:06.920 --> 08:11.080]  on C-SPAN so that the American people can see what the choices are because part
[08:11.080 --> 08:15.040]  of what we have to do is enlist the American people in this process. I would
[08:15.040 --> 08:18.360]  put my plan forward and I would welcome input and say here my goals reduce
[08:18.360 --> 08:24.960]  costs increased quality coverage for everybody if you have better ideas please
[08:24.960 --> 08:31.880]  present them but these negotiations will be on C-SPAN and so the public will be
[08:31.880 --> 08:36.720]  part of the conversation and we'll see the choices that are being made. I respect
[08:36.720 --> 08:42.360]  what the Clintons tried to do in 1993 and moving health reform forward but they
[08:42.360 --> 08:46.640]  made one really big mistake and that is they took all their people and all their
[08:46.640 --> 08:52.720]  experts into a room and then they closed the door. We will work on this
[08:52.720 --> 09:00.160]  process publicly it'll be on C-SPAN it will be streaming over the net. We'll have
[09:00.160 --> 09:05.600]  the negotiations televised on C-SPAN so that people can see who is making
[09:05.600 --> 09:09.240]  arguments on behalf of their constituents and who is make who are
[09:09.240 --> 09:13.520]  making arguments on behalf of the drug companies or the insurance companies. But
[09:13.520 --> 09:17.680]  here's the thing we're going to do all these negotiations on C-SPAN so the
[09:17.680 --> 09:22.800]  American people will be able to watch these negotiations. Drug and insurance
[09:22.800 --> 09:25.280]  companies will have a seat at the table they just won't be able to buy every
[09:25.280 --> 09:33.240]  single chair and we will have a public process performing this plan it'll be
[09:33.240 --> 09:36.760]  televised on C-SPAN I can't guarantee it'll be exciting so not everybody is
[09:36.760 --> 09:41.720]  going to be watching but it will be transparent and accountable to the
[09:41.720 --> 10:02.160]  American people. So I'll put forward my plan but what I'll say is look if you
[10:02.160 --> 10:09.000]  got better ideas I'm happy to listen to them but all this will be done on C-SPAN
[10:09.000 --> 10:14.800]  in front of the public. One of my jobs is the president will be to guide this
[10:14.800 --> 10:18.960]  process so that it's an honest process.
[10:20.640 --> 10:25.680]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the
[10:25.680 --> 10:36.120]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. There is
[10:36.120 --> 10:41.200]  President Obama in the last two years a year on the campaign trail close to a
[10:41.200 --> 10:46.680]  year in office over and over and over again that's just a small sampling of
[10:46.680 --> 10:51.840]  him saying it would all be on C-SPAN. Now for the last three days it's been
[10:51.840 --> 10:56.960]  completely secret and the White House told the media yesterday it will remain
[10:56.960 --> 11:01.120]  secret under White House request now they've capitulated and they said okay
[11:01.120 --> 11:09.120]  we'll have one hour of literally dozens and dozens and dozens of hours of closed
[11:09.120 --> 11:13.240]  door negotiations from early in the morning to late at night one staged
[11:13.240 --> 11:18.320]  hour for the Democrats to sit there and tell everyone that everything's fine and
[11:18.320 --> 11:23.880]  that the legislation is great and that everything is good and that no one can
[11:23.880 --> 11:28.320]  see the final product. You see if this had all been public the payoffs the
[11:28.320 --> 11:33.720]  bribes the promises the billion dollar port barrel gifts to people to go along
[11:33.720 --> 11:38.720]  with it would have been public and this is scores of hours just the last three
[11:38.720 --> 11:45.080]  days he promised that all the other hearings would be televised but they
[11:45.080 --> 11:50.800]  haven't been. They don't want you to see the sausage of tyranny being made
[11:50.800 --> 11:57.040]  because it is a ugly ugly business and there are in the final bill the final
[11:57.040 --> 12:01.480]  version this is now the Associated Press taxes money to be taken out of
[12:01.480 --> 12:05.600]  everyone's checks to a general fund on top of it you'll be ordered to buy
[12:05.600 --> 12:14.440]  separate insurance on average at around $15,000 a year. If you can't pay you
[12:14.440 --> 12:17.520]  will be enrolled into a government welfare system see if you didn't have
[12:17.520 --> 12:20.720]  the money for health care or didn't want health care say you're 25 years old and
[12:20.720 --> 12:24.760]  healthy you wanted to invest that money or spend it somewhere else you will now
[12:24.760 --> 12:28.720]  be forced to get government health care and be on government assistance and
[12:28.720 --> 12:34.000]  then your rights are waived under that they want everyone institutionalized
[12:34.000 --> 12:39.320]  everyone on the government dole everyone dependent and then giant debts are
[12:39.320 --> 12:46.200]  run up paid back to the very banks that created the fiat money and the fiat
[12:46.200 --> 12:55.360]  loans out of thin air the whole system is about getting you dependent the
[12:55.360 --> 13:01.160]  entire program is about getting you under their control getting you on the
[13:01.160 --> 13:05.880]  government reservation in the government cult and what does any cult want to do
[13:05.880 --> 13:10.480]  it wants to control its members it wants to make its members dependent on the
[13:10.480 --> 13:19.040]  cult leader and that's what the parasite psycho run cult of government criminal
[13:19.040 --> 13:26.960]  enterprise is period we're gonna have a lot of open phones today but I want to
[13:26.960 --> 13:34.960]  go back in the last hour of the show today and play some famous clips of top
[13:34.960 --> 13:41.880]  socialists top liberals of the last century who openly supported Hitler and
[13:41.880 --> 13:49.280]  Lenin and then Stalin and who openly top eugenicists that openly called for
[13:49.280 --> 13:54.960]  nerve-gassing the general population and killing the majority of the world
[13:54.960 --> 14:01.080]  population you know you read this in eco science written by the White House
[14:01.080 --> 14:03.960]  science are how to sterilize people in the water how to reduce the world
[14:03.960 --> 14:07.960]  population you read it in the State Department of a random 200 you read it
[14:07.960 --> 14:12.600]  in the 1996 UN biological diversity assessment but I thought we would go
[14:12.600 --> 14:19.200]  back to the roots of this in the 20s and 30s and play these recordings on air
[14:19.200 --> 14:26.160]  where they openly talk about establishing world government to kill you I
[14:26.160 --> 14:33.000]  know that's shocking I know that's hard for a lot of people to believe I know
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.320]  it's mind-boggling for a lot of people but that is the reality and once you
[14:38.320 --> 14:42.720]  realize the system they're setting up everything that doesn't make sense
[14:42.720 --> 14:57.280]  suddenly makes perfect sense all you need to have is the courage is the
[14:57.280 --> 15:04.720]  courage to actually read what the Fabian socialist out of England and the
[15:04.720 --> 15:10.600]  United States said they were going to set up an erect and when you understand
[15:10.600 --> 15:18.720]  that socialism is a scientific dictatorship from its foundation from
[15:18.720 --> 15:26.320]  the laying of its cornerstone it is all about learning how humans operate and
[15:26.320 --> 15:33.880]  setting up a final revolution of scientific tyranny and that is our main
[15:33.880 --> 15:49.160]  message here on air yesterday I talked about a homeschooling family in New
[15:49.160 --> 15:58.960]  York State where the families were arrested where the families were
[15:58.960 --> 16:03.920]  arrested the family there have been many families arrested around the country
[16:03.920 --> 16:11.640]  where the mother and father were arrested in this particular case for child
[16:11.640 --> 16:21.760]  endangerment for not registering their homeschool children ages 8 to 14 with the
[16:21.760 --> 16:28.960]  government and I went and read the New York code and it was similar to other
[16:28.960 --> 16:37.160]  states it's a civil matter they didn't put them on notice they didn't warn them
[16:37.160 --> 16:41.400]  they came and arrested them and demonized them with their mug shots on
[16:41.400 --> 16:50.680]  television and they arrested them under child endangerment not under the law
[16:50.680 --> 16:54.480]  that New York passed that you had to register your children with the state
[16:54.480 --> 16:59.280]  even if you homeschool and that's the point that I'm making here the
[16:59.280 --> 17:11.240]  unelected eugenics courts the unelected family courts that's what they are they
[17:11.240 --> 17:21.280]  are allowed to swear out an order to the police that something is
[17:21.280 --> 17:25.320]  endangerment now you would think of endangerment of children letting them
[17:25.320 --> 17:30.160]  play with gasoline or letting them run around with butcher knives or giving a
[17:30.160 --> 17:36.960]  five-year-old a firearm and letting them run around the street with it or child
[17:36.960 --> 17:44.920]  labor having having a six-year-old child drive a combine tractor no the
[17:44.920 --> 17:50.040]  endangerment was not registering them so they arrested them under another
[17:50.040 --> 17:57.320]  criminal clause and are trying to take their children now and I saw these
[17:57.320 --> 18:01.600]  fools on the YouTube video posted of my rant I saw these fools in the comments
[18:01.600 --> 18:06.360]  on the article that curtain emo wrote about homeschooling parents arrested
[18:06.360 --> 18:11.920]  slavery returns to the United States saying look at Alex with his disinfo
[18:11.920 --> 18:18.840]  they were arrested for breaking the law they deserve it no they were arrested on
[18:18.840 --> 18:23.520]  trumped-up garbage from the unconstitutional family eugenics courts
[18:23.520 --> 18:27.880]  the same courts that would swear out orders to have over a half million
[18:27.880 --> 18:37.680]  American women sterilized for no reason in the United States that's what went
[18:37.680 --> 18:42.440]  on that's what happened and even if you believe that it's the law which it
[18:42.440 --> 18:48.200]  wasn't it's a manipulation it was the law that blacks weren't human and that
[18:48.200 --> 18:53.040]  you could kill black people if they didn't pull their plow right or if they
[18:53.040 --> 18:58.160]  didn't lick your boots right and that's the whole issue in the article Kurt
[18:58.160 --> 19:03.680]  wrote he shows how under UN treaty the US is under UN law and the stated goal of

[24:19.760 --> 24:23.760]  with each other but they agree upon the policy of keeping us dumb down and in
[24:23.760 --> 24:30.760]  bondage and now you have the government about the snatch control of health care
[24:30.760 --> 24:36.160]  then people will be even more dependent on government the taxes will be even
[24:36.160 --> 24:41.240]  higher in England in Iceland in Europe in the United States in Canada
[24:41.240 --> 24:45.800]  conservative and liberal leaders all on the same Baker payroll are saying we've
[24:45.800 --> 24:52.400]  got to raise taxes our deficits so big it wasn't a bailout of the bankers it was
[24:52.400 --> 24:58.760]  a full capitulation to them allowing them to engineer the crisis and then
[24:58.760 --> 25:03.920]  literally swallow up our economy and so they prepare to plunge the economy even
[25:03.920 --> 25:09.760]  more and then demand even more power and then we acquiesce again and the job
[25:09.760 --> 25:14.280] lessness goes up more factory shut down but the government grows and grows and
[25:14.280 --> 25:20.120]  grows and grows and more police and more CPS declaring that you're insolvent

[25:36.600 --> 25:41.600]  the dollar is investors around the world dump their US assets a former Bank of
[25:41.600 --> 25:48.720]  England policy maker has warned and he goes on to say he believes there's a
[25:48.720 --> 25:53.120]  good chance the dollar will completely collapse he says the past eight years of
[25:53.120 --> 25:57.480]  imperial overreach hubris to domestic international abuse of power on the part
[25:57.480 --> 26:02.000]  of the Bush administration has left the US materially weakened financially
[26:02.000 --> 26:11.840]  economically politically and morally and we see the continue slide the
[26:11.840 --> 26:19.200]  continue sliding of the dollar ladies and gentlemen and the deficit spiraling
[26:19.200 --> 26:23.520]  spiraling spiraling and our factories no longer produce anything but the
[26:23.520 --> 26:28.720]  universities produce giant phalanxes of armored vehicles and police and black
[26:28.720 --> 26:32.760]  uniforms marching out to meet the people marching out to set up the
[26:32.760 --> 26:37.440]  checkpoints to write the tickets to pass new laws on texting and being on the
[26:37.440 --> 26:42.200]  cell phone and being tired while you drive and new laws about yelling at your
[26:42.200 --> 26:49.180]  children and new regulations in any way to catch you in their traps and as an
[26:49.180 --> 26:53.320]  active submission oh you don't like thumb scanning to get your school lunches
[26:53.320 --> 26:57.720]  or thumb scanning at the grocery store or thumb scanning at the bank how about
[26:57.720 --> 27:02.240]  body scanning how about naked body scanning and the media puts out these
[27:02.240 --> 27:06.120]  polls and says there are you for high-tech screeners so that you go
[27:06.120 --> 27:12.280]  through airports quickly and don't have to be strip searched oh yes I am but the
[27:12.280 --> 27:16.960]  London Guardian has a poll where 76% of people are against the scanners and if
[27:16.960 --> 27:20.520]  you actually ask someone do you like being body scan and someone looking at
[27:20.520 --> 27:25.800]  your an image of your naked body the vast majority are against it but the
[27:25.800 --> 27:33.520]  media runs this huge hoax saying the public loves it and the White House
[27:33.520 --> 27:38.720]  admits a security lapse but don't worry they've got the body scanners going in
[27:38.720 --> 27:46.920]  for you where will they stop there every promise broken everything they do
[27:46.920 --> 27:52.040]  criminal and Obama under huge public pressure the last three days with
[27:52.040 --> 27:57.920]  secret conference committee meetings said okay we'll give you a token one hour
[27:57.920 --> 28:02.120]  where the leaders of the parties will sit there and make brief statements and
[28:02.120 --> 28:08.280]  that's the and that's the behind the scenes you'll see but at least they're
[28:08.280 --> 28:12.720]  being forced to put out that token and at least everyone is seeing what liars
[28:12.720 --> 28:21.920]  they are it's tokenism oh yeah we're gonna we're gonna cut welfare we're
[28:21.920 --> 28:25.480]  gonna cut the chicken feed to the public leave domesticated but we're gonna
[28:25.480 --> 28:32.520]  massively increase the taxes everything is a fraud what is it that you people on
[28:32.520 --> 28:38.160]  the fake left living your life out on a false political spectrum what is it
[28:38.160 --> 28:48.600]  that you don't understand about big government it serves the ultra rich it
[28:48.600 --> 28:52.760]  creates criminal monopolies
[29:00.120 --> 29:04.960]  do you like the direction we're going in because when Republicans get in office
[29:04.960 --> 29:10.160]  in the house in a year and then the presidency in three we can't have
[29:10.160 --> 29:14.080]  conservatives go to sleep and suddenly love big government and big deficits and
[29:14.080 --> 29:23.920]  open borders and gun control and checkpoints and body scanners again the
[29:23.920 --> 29:28.000]  party in power always rapes you because they're the drill bit of the new old
[29:28.000 --> 29:33.360]  order drilling into the republic's art republican or democrat until that
[29:33.360 --> 29:39.080]  awakening happens until people shatter the left right paradigm it's only going
[29:39.080 --> 29:45.400]  to get worse they know you're completely caught up in a fake left right debate

[36:57.560 --> 37:02.400]  Department of Education before it was even called that that they needed to get
[37:02.400 --> 37:09.320]  everybody with a lower IQ and nerve gas them we're gonna be going over all of
[37:09.320 --> 37:14.800]  that coming up and Hitler quoted Shaw
[37:15.880 --> 37:26.160]  garbles quoted Sean they mean business these are the most vicious strain of
[37:26.160 --> 37:30.280]  psychopathic killers you can ever imagine it's like Chris Matthews saying
[37:30.280 --> 37:38.080]  his great hero Saul Alinsky who pledged himself and his book to Lucifer and who
[37:38.080 --> 37:44.320]  wanted work camps work brigades mass arrest I mean this guy was a vicious
[37:44.320 --> 37:51.960]  Stalinist a vicious Stalinist when you go to hardcore communist websites they
[37:51.960 --> 37:56.840]  call him the communist communist Chris Matthews making millions of dollars a
[37:56.840 --> 38:03.880]  year of course he's a communist the ultimate capitalist is a communist remember
[38:03.880 --> 38:09.760]  when the last Chinese premier stepped down what was it six years ago it was a
[38:09.760 --> 38:16.000]  BBC headline departing Chinese leaders says China the ultimate expression of
[38:16.000 --> 38:20.280]  capitalism then his quote was our communism is the greatest form of
[38:20.280 --> 38:24.240]  capitalism people said what does that mean well when you read David Rockefeller
[38:24.240 --> 38:30.600]  in the 1976 New York Times praising Mao and his extermination I actually went
[38:30.600 --> 38:35.320]  and got the microfilm I didn't just believe the quotes online we went to
[38:35.320 --> 38:43.480]  UT and got the New York Times if you're a giant robber baron you put one thug in
[38:43.480 --> 38:48.520]  he kills 60 million people and takes all their money and gives it to Rockefeller
[38:48.520 --> 38:53.760]  don't you understand you idiots that like big government and and that goes
[38:53.760 --> 38:59.640]  for you you scum Republicans you mainline filthy evil America killers

[41:02.920 --> 41:10.000]  you understand mainline moron liberals you bought into a false paradigm it's a
[41:10.000 --> 41:17.760]  mirage a spell a hoax a trance a false political system you follow it isn't

[41:25.600 --> 41:31.360]  government just isn't corrupt it's scientific it's a scientific guillotine
[41:31.360 --> 41:47.000]  wake up please I'm talking to you straight I mean I've got articles here in
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.760]  my stack I've got two out of the London Guardian where they report like it's no
[41:51.760 --> 41:58.760]  big deal care homes forcing elderly to have feeding tubes fitted under the
[41:58.760 --> 42:01.640]  government health care system now if you want to be able to go to a nursing
[42:01.640 --> 42:04.720]  home they make you get a feeding tube in your stomach like you're the board
[42:04.720 --> 42:08.080]  because they're not going to give you food they're going to jack you in and
[42:08.080 --> 42:12.520]  stick morphine in you and kill your butt the case for killing granny cover of
[42:12.520 --> 42:16.920]  Newsweek it's now environmentally sensitive and liberal and yet's how you
[42:16.920 --> 42:22.480]  save the earth from climate change London Guardian Britain must launch GM food
[42:22.480 --> 42:27.680]  revolution says chief scientist Britain must embrace genetically modified
[42:27.680 --> 42:30.920]  crops and cutting-edge developments such as nanotechnology to avoid
[42:30.920 --> 42:34.880]  catastrophic food shortages the government pays people not to produce
[42:34.880 --> 42:40.240]  food folks and future climate change the government chief scientists warned
[42:40.240 --> 42:47.480]  today now if you're not for cross species open-air pollinated deadly biosphere
[42:47.480 --> 42:52.880]  wrecking systems that could actually wound the earth carbon oxides what it
[42:52.880 --> 42:59.080]  sucks up like a pig eating slop it loves it so that's their sick joke they list
[42:59.080 --> 43:07.280]  that as poison and then they say you've got to have GMO to save the earth have
[43:07.280 --> 43:12.160]  you read the writings of the top transhumanist and eugenicist the
[43:12.160 --> 43:19.200]  modern ones these people say they're God they say they're gonna wipe all of us
[43:19.200 --> 43:22.720]  out as soon as their grids in place and that they're gonna merge with
[43:22.720 --> 43:26.560]  high technology and live forever I don't know if that's real or not but I know
[43:26.560 --> 43:32.720]  these lunatics believe it and they say there's nothing unnatural because they
[43:32.720 --> 43:37.120]  are a product of survival of the fittest social Darwinism and so no matter
[43:37.120 --> 43:42.240]  what bio system they release no matter what genetically engineered product they
[43:42.240 --> 43:50.480]  release if they release something that kills everything that's natural these
[43:50.480 --> 43:54.920]  are sickos these are people that have had billions of dollars all the money all
[43:54.920 --> 44:00.760]  the sex raping kids stuff you see in movies like hostile that's all over the
[44:00.760 --> 44:04.240]  European news every week where they find young women with their teeth ripped
[44:04.240 --> 44:08.480]  out heads cut off torture dungeons with people hanging on meat hooks and it's
[44:08.480 --> 44:11.920]  just kept quiet back of the newspaper that's what these people do on holiday
[44:11.920 --> 44:15.480]  they're just ripping children's teeth out with pliers sawing people in half
[44:15.480 --> 44:21.760]  dipping people in acid giant torture camps all over facilities underground
[44:21.760 --> 44:26.400]  facilities in in Romania and everywhere else with with with with with with
[44:26.400 --> 44:30.800]  horse stables and where they have torture camps it just comes out and the
[44:30.800 --> 44:34.640]  CIA people are in there just raping and slaughtering and just loving it it's all
[44:34.640 --> 44:42.800]  part of their satanic enjoyment hidden in plain view you cannot imagine the full
[44:42.800 --> 44:46.280]  evil that is upon us
[44:48.560 --> 44:53.280]  George Bertrand Shaw said once world government was in place they were gonna
[44:53.280 --> 45:00.000]  nerve gas 90 plus percent of us I'm gonna play the video and audio of him in
[45:00.000 --> 45:07.040]  the last hour they can't wait you know you enjoy popping a beer and drinking it
[45:07.040 --> 45:10.320]  sitting there on the fishing dock and looking at the pretty trees to them
[45:10.320 --> 45:16.440]  children hanging on meat hooks is beautiful you better grow up and realize
[45:16.440 --> 45:21.360]  who these control freaks are the greatest pleasure for a control freak is to
[45:21.360 --> 45:29.880]  hurt innocence it is a journey into evil why did every human culture in
[45:29.880 --> 45:39.360]  Africa in Asia in Europe in Latin America in Mesoamerica why did every
[45:39.360 --> 45:43.600]  culture did the government order randomly men women and children to be
[45:43.600 --> 45:48.720]  sacrificed to be burned alive to have their hearts cut out because 1% of the
[45:48.720 --> 45:53.120]  population are psychopaths conservatively they're not artificially
[45:53.120 --> 45:57.480]  turning people into psychopaths where the numbers are maybe one out of ten or a
[45:57.480 --> 46:04.600]  functioning psychopath a synthetic psycho but one out of a hundred are true
[46:04.600 --> 46:13.240]  are true psychos thoroughbreds and they always take control of societies
[46:13.240 --> 46:16.720]  because you're gonna have good kings you're gonna have bad kings but always
[46:16.720 --> 46:21.440]  psychos get in control then there's reigns of hell and the psychos write
[46:21.440 --> 46:25.520]  books and say our reigns of hell always get brought down because we collapse but
[46:25.520 --> 46:29.280]  we're gonna set up a scientific system so we can keep on raping and trampling and
[46:29.280 --> 46:32.960]  being trampled on and slaughtering and murdering what an Orwell write about
[46:32.960 --> 46:36.520]  when O'Brien's torturing Winston he said we're the priest of power always
[46:36.520 --> 46:40.600]  trampling and being trampled upon we're gonna keep on ripping and sapping and
[46:40.600 --> 46:44.440]  slaughtering and murdering and Orwell gave speeches and wrote letters and oh
[46:44.440 --> 46:48.280]  yes this is what I experienced as a British secret police officer as a
[46:48.280 --> 46:52.280]  Soviet agent then as a high-level British agent the government controls the
[46:52.280 --> 46:56.240]  communism and the fascism it's all controlled and I put it in this novel
[46:56.240 --> 47:04.160]  to explain it to you in every culture they burn children they rip teeth out
[47:04.160 --> 47:11.360]  they cut hearts out they torture that's what they do that's who they are and I
[47:11.360 --> 47:15.120]  see them and I have to see them on television every day and know what they
[47:15.120 --> 47:18.800]  really are know they're the real monsters and I have to watch you decanate
[47:18.800 --> 47:24.640]  and weak and chicken neck enjoying this thinking it's funny out there you
[47:24.640 --> 47:38.440]  idiots grow up every culture is taken over by these people every culture does
[47:38.440 --> 47:43.760]  it the Jews were constantly turning back to human sacrifice and their
[47:43.760 --> 47:48.880]  societies would collapse all their neighbors engage in human sacrifice the
[47:48.880 --> 47:56.160]  Greeks engage in human sacrifice the Romans the Aztecs the Toltecs the
[47:56.160 --> 48:05.800]  umax the Olmecs every druidic culture engaged in sacrifice and it was the
[48:05.800 --> 48:11.200]  mind control of the druidic priest would come what do you think trick-or-treat is
[48:11.200 --> 48:18.880]  it's a night between shower and Sam Hain they would come to your door and
[48:18.880 --> 48:25.200]  sometimes they'd ask for a cat or a dog or an ox or a horse but in the larger
[48:25.200 --> 48:28.440]  towns they would come and a lot of times to exercise their power they would
[48:28.440 --> 48:36.680]  order a nobleman a well-to-do I demand the king of our tribe and they would
[48:36.680 --> 48:41.520]  deliver the king it might only happen every 20 years and the priests would rise
[48:41.520 --> 48:49.200]  him up and tie him to the wicker man and bring forth fire and burn him to death
[48:49.200 --> 48:53.600]  and they would come to your house and they would be offerings of gold or
[48:53.600 --> 48:59.720]  silver or gems of the poor people would offer would offer fruits and
[48:59.720 --> 49:06.400]  vegetables and the priests would say no you will deliver your child to me as an
[49:06.400 --> 49:10.280]  apprentice and so they would have their own little enforcers they like the
[49:10.280 --> 49:16.360]  particular strong boys at age 12 or 14 that came from stronger families to be
[49:16.360 --> 49:21.080]  their warrior enforcers and still other times they would go to the family and
[49:21.080 --> 49:27.720]  say give me your two-year-old it will enter the bone fire a fortnight and they
[49:27.720 --> 49:32.120]  would take that baby and they would throw it into the pits all over England
[49:32.120 --> 49:37.040]  all over Scotland all over Ireland there are giant pits filled with bones of
[49:37.040 --> 49:42.120]  burned children and now the new-world order will have its way with billions
[49:42.120 --> 49:46.520]  they will slaughter billions with pleasure they will slaughter billions
[49:46.520 --> 49:51.440]  with lust and the billions will beg for murder and beg to be killed and the
[49:51.440 --> 49:56.240]  worship of their government and one of the final phases is you submitting
[49:56.240 --> 50:01.040]  yourself to be naked body scanned to be humiliated as you are brought into the
[50:01.040 --> 50:10.320]  forces of hell you are baptized in death and slavery I have illustrated to you
[50:10.320 --> 50:16.280]  the truth I have come to you with the awful truth of what our species does
[50:16.280 --> 50:24.600]  every single time that's why I don't like Nazis because they blame everything on
[50:24.600 --> 50:31.040]  Jews and say all evil flows from Jews oh really were Jews teaching the Aztecs how
[50:31.040 --> 50:34.360]  to sacrifice were they teaching the Visigoths and the Vandals in
[50:34.360 --> 50:40.720]  Germania how to sacrifice oh Jews engage in human sacrifice to everyone does it
[50:40.720 --> 50:45.680]  everyone has psychopaths I oppose the Jewish psychopath I oppose the Chinese
[50:45.680 --> 50:52.000]  psychopath I oppose the Japanese psychopath I oppose the Mexican psychopath

[52:12.200 --> 52:15.440]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have turned a
[52:15.440 --> 52:20.120]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[52:20.120 --> 52:25.400]  the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[52:25.400 --> 52:29.400]  attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the
[52:29.400 --> 52:34.600]  criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[52:34.600 --> 52:38.280]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists
[52:38.280 --> 52:41.800]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[52:41.800 --> 52:46.360]  check out too. Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC
[52:46.360 --> 52:52.000]  we have seen a fall of the Republic. Yet your copy of Fall of the Republic on

[53:08.720 --> 53:13.200]  which we feature on ofthefield.com. Here's a small sample of all that people
[53:13.200 --> 53:17.760]  like you have to say about the wild food experience. It's inspiring for many who
[53:17.760 --> 53:21.320]  are affected by the recent downturn of the economy. I already knew a bit about
[53:21.320 --> 53:25.400]  foraging and edibles but you take it to a whole new level. A thousand thanks to
[53:25.400 --> 53:29.640]  you for all that great knowledge it was empowering. When I was in the Navy I went
[53:29.640 --> 53:32.880]  through a couple of quick land survival classes. Thank you for being an
[53:32.880 --> 53:36.480]  inspiration and for all the work that you do. I really appreciate the depth and
[53:36.480 --> 53:40.400]  detail of the information. Thank you so much. Much love and respect to you from

[54:00.680 --> 54:12.280]  The priest class always in every culture took young strong men at age 12 to 14
[54:12.280 --> 54:16.320]  and trained them to be their warrior enforcers. You notice the Nazis had
[54:16.320 --> 54:20.680]  Hitler youth, Stalin had his youth corps, Mao had the youth corps, the
[54:20.680 --> 54:25.680]  communist youth brigades. The Boy Scouts are now completely in major cities like
[54:25.680 --> 54:29.680]  LA turning their explorer scouts over to the police department. They openly
[54:29.680 --> 54:33.920]  trained to take on the American people and gun confiscation. The psychopath
[54:33.920 --> 54:40.320]  spins a web like a certain species of spider will spin a certain web a and
[54:40.320 --> 54:45.720]  then individually a variant that can be fingerprinted to that particular spider
[54:45.720 --> 54:51.120]  and it's the same thing with these people and that's what we oppose is a
[54:51.120 --> 54:57.000]  guild of psychopaths and you know I've said my piece on it. Ron Paul is coming
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.880]  up in the next hour. Let's go to David and Pennsylvania. David you're on the
[54:59.880 --> 55:03.880]  air. Thank you very much Alex for your time and it's very precious I know that
[55:03.880 --> 55:08.000]  and I'll go straight to the point. You need to know your enemy and know
[55:08.000 --> 55:11.880]  yourself and you can fight hundreds of battles with no danger of defeat and the
[55:11.880 --> 55:15.640]  reason is because the truth and the truth shall set you free and it says in
[55:15.640 --> 55:21.640]  Revelation. In Revelation 13 says I beheld another beast coming up out of
[55:21.640 --> 55:26.160]  the earth and it says he spake as a dragon and it says any deceived them
[55:26.160 --> 55:30.160]  that dwell on the earth and by the means of the miracles which he had power to do
[55:30.160 --> 55:34.880]  in the sight of the beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they
[55:34.880 --> 55:41.080]  should make an image to that beast and to the wound by the sword in which he
[55:41.080 --> 55:45.640]  lived and he had power to give life and he was the image of the beast and the
[55:45.640 --> 55:51.200]  image of the beast should both speak and cause that many would worship him and
[55:51.200 --> 55:57.120]  it was a human number which is a biometric calculation yes rendering
[55:57.120 --> 56:01.120]  your body scan to the beast and he said well wait I'm getting to that Alex
[56:01.120 --> 56:06.080]  there's another thing here says and he caused both small and great rich and
[56:06.080 --> 56:10.080]  poor free or bond to receive the mark on their right hand or on their forehead
[56:10.080 --> 56:17.200]  and no man in the site will sell or save or that which he is mark unless he has
[56:17.200 --> 56:21.280]  the beast and the number of that is and says here is a news wisdom that
[56:21.280 --> 56:25.160]  understanding should count the number of the beast is a number of that of a man
[56:25.160 --> 56:31.200]  of his number is 606 and again the number of a man what is the number of a
[56:31.200 --> 56:36.320]  man a biometric calculation you will not buy nor sell and his image would be
[56:36.320 --> 56:42.280]  seen worldwide you read that and it is just unbelievable going back to 1st
[56:42.280 --> 56:46.240]  Corinthians chapter 7 it says here nevertheless to avoid fornication let
[56:46.240 --> 56:49.840]  every man have his own wife and every woman his own husband but the husband
[56:49.840 --> 56:56.160]  redner under dude beveled beveled to the wife and that likewise the wife into
[56:56.160 --> 57:01.080]  the husband and the wife have not power over all and that likewise the husband
[57:01.080 --> 57:05.360]  have not power over his own body but the wife defraud you not one another you
[57:05.360 --> 57:11.280]  know what that body that's being scanned in there belongs and mankind and all
[57:11.280 --> 57:15.560]  this world somebody's calling you you know your call waiting city yeah well
[57:15.560 --> 57:19.280]  this is a more important I don't understand and I believe and I've been
[57:19.280 --> 57:23.680]  praying about being able to speak to you and and we we have to understand the
[57:23.680 --> 57:26.840]  truth shall set you free and it's only through God's word as Christians look
[57:26.840 --> 57:33.000]  it is a religious act of submission to take your shoes off to body scan to do
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.560]  all of this isn't it it is what prisoners do when they're brought into a
[57:36.560 --> 57:41.440]  prison dock you got 30 seconds left right all right well very very simply
[57:41.440 --> 57:45.200]  there's so many jellyfish Christians that are not standing for the word of
[57:45.200 --> 57:48.000]  God and if they would stand for the word God they would not go through these
[57:48.000 --> 57:51.480]  scanners and they would know what the word of God says and to set them free and
[57:51.480 --> 57:56.120]  it says here that we have to understand that we wrestle not against flesh and
[57:56.120 --> 57:59.640]  blood and against principalities and powers and but remember what Pat
[57:59.640 --> 58:04.760]  Robertson says he says thumbprint face scan it's of the Lord I have the video
[58:04.760 --> 58:09.200]  clips so the Christians all say I must do it and the Pope says do it and the
[58:09.200 --> 58:14.320]  Pope says global taxes are good and Pope says carbon dioxide's bad and that the
[58:14.320 --> 58:18.000]  earth is the center of the universe so it must be true I appreciate your call
[58:18.000 --> 58:23.440]  yeah it's just unbelievable more calls coming up Ron Paul coming up Wilson Sam

[59:51.760 --> 1:00:06.480]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[1:00:06.480 --> 1:00:13.760]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[1:00:13.760 --> 1:00:23.760]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[1:00:24.760 --> 1:00:31.400]  a great example of how the truth can prevail if you just continue to put out
[1:00:31.400 --> 1:00:35.360]  the truth and have a long view of history for 30 years congressman Ron Paul
[1:00:35.360 --> 1:00:40.360]  has fought he has exposed the private Federal Reserve he's having victory there
[1:00:40.360 --> 1:00:44.200]  now thanks to all the great supporters out there he's now all over mainstream
[1:00:44.200 --> 1:00:48.560]  television the New York Times the LA Times the Houston Chronicles say Ron
[1:00:48.560 --> 1:00:53.600]  Paul is right you know from outsider to mainline and thank God he's been there
[1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:57.160]  telling the truth so that people now have a choice between collectivism big
[1:00:57.160 --> 1:01:00.880]  government and tyranny he's with us for the next 30 minutes to talk about a
[1:01:00.880 --> 1:01:05.400]  host of issues congressman Ron Paul out of the gates our first interview with you
[1:01:05.400 --> 1:01:11.040]  of 2010 what do you think's most important right now well the big issue is
[1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:16.160]  how much of our freedom we're gonna have you know in the next year or two are we
[1:01:16.160 --> 1:01:20.200]  losing it and I say we are and that to me is the biggest issue because I have
[1:01:20.200 --> 1:01:23.840]  such confidence in free people that when we're free and left alone and allowed to
[1:01:23.840 --> 1:01:27.240]  keep the fruits of our labor things take care of themselves we can do a much
[1:01:27.240 --> 1:01:31.840]  better job than the government but if you go more specifically I would say
[1:01:31.840 --> 1:01:37.120]  there too one is you know our expanded involvement overseas which poses a
[1:01:37.120 --> 1:01:40.960]  danger to us physical danger as well as the danger to the men that have to go
[1:01:40.960 --> 1:01:45.600]  over there and then the next thing I would be most concerned about is what I
[1:01:45.600 --> 1:01:50.200]  think is going to happen at the economy I don't think this is past as I think
[1:01:50.200 --> 1:01:54.160]  we're just barely into the correction because they're doing everything
[1:01:54.160 --> 1:01:58.480]  possible to prevent the correction and you always have to have a correction in
[1:01:58.480 --> 1:02:02.880]  order to get back to work again well I want to go over that in some detail
[1:02:02.880 --> 1:02:06.280]  coming up in the interview what's happening with all these expanded wars
[1:02:06.280 --> 1:02:12.080]  but first off secret health care conference going on this week Obama had
[1:02:12.080 --> 1:02:15.240]  promised to put it on c-span but I don't know how he has the authority over
[1:02:15.240 --> 1:02:21.560]  Congress but now Obama says okay one hour kind of a staged event with talking
[1:02:21.560 --> 1:02:25.720]  points the public can see that your take on that congressman
[1:02:25.720 --> 1:02:30.040]  well it just shows the hypocrisy of the whole thing what people say in campaigns
[1:02:30.040 --> 1:02:36.040]  and then what they do afterwards but most of the time the important things that
[1:02:36.040 --> 1:02:40.240]  come out of Washington are done in secret I've known that for ever since I've
[1:02:40.240 --> 1:02:44.760]  been in Washington the conference has always been very very secretive and I
[1:02:44.760 --> 1:02:49.520]  think one time in 1980 they had the monetary control act come up and the
[1:02:49.520 --> 1:02:54.440]  most important part of the bill came up in the conference they stick it in the
[1:02:54.440 --> 1:02:57.920]  conference used to be well theoretically the conference is supposed to
[1:02:57.920 --> 1:03:02.520]  bring the numbers together if the house has 50 and the Senate has 100 you're
[1:03:02.520 --> 1:03:06.680]  supposed to agree on the compromise and go with 75 but the conference is where
[1:03:06.680 --> 1:03:11.080]  they do all the mischief and that's where you know the big deals are made
[1:03:11.080 --> 1:03:15.440]  when the conference report comes back to the House floor it's usually brought
[1:03:15.440 --> 1:03:19.000]  back with a one-hour debate no amendments and most people think oh we
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:22.480]  fully discussed this how do I vote for this before oh I vote against this I'll
[1:03:22.480 --> 1:03:27.800]  vote against again and so this is what's going on I'm not surprised at all
[1:03:27.800 --> 1:03:32.680]  they're they're never going to tell us exactly what's in there it'll be months
[1:03:32.680 --> 1:03:37.360]  if not years to figure out exactly what the consequences will be because then
[1:03:37.360 --> 1:03:41.120]  we will have delivered a lot of power to the agencies of government then the
[1:03:41.120 --> 1:03:45.640]  agency's right all the rules and regulations there'll be tax codes
[1:03:45.640 --> 1:03:50.520]  changes and we won't know for years exactly what happens I know there's a
[1:03:50.520 --> 1:03:55.080]  lot of condemnation of people not reading those bills and of course it's
[1:03:55.080 --> 1:03:58.640]  impossible to read them or understand them but I don't think there is any one
[1:03:58.640 --> 1:04:02.400]  individual that could read both of those bills and know what's in it you know
[1:04:02.400 --> 1:04:07.560]  this is they're so bad that's why anytime you come upon a situation like
[1:04:07.560 --> 1:04:12.560]  this any member of Congress I just vote no on it because they know it's up you
[1:04:12.560 --> 1:04:17.560]  know it's no good and it's back today you know do it in secret means that you
[1:04:17.560 --> 1:04:22.280]  can't trust what they're doing it's over 4,000 pages with both versions and
[1:04:22.280 --> 1:04:28.960]  jail time and new taxes and cutting benefits even socialists like Dennis
[1:04:28.960 --> 1:04:32.400]  Kacinich in the house with you and even the head of the Democratic Party have
[1:04:32.400 --> 1:04:37.080]  said it's not a good bill no and the left might there may be some on the left
[1:04:37.080 --> 1:04:40.120]  it will pose it but they'll probably only oppose it because there's not enough
[1:04:40.120 --> 1:04:46.720]  government and fortunately you know the Republicans are doing a better job of
[1:04:46.720 --> 1:04:51.280]  sticking together on this you know if we wish we're president that wouldn't be
[1:04:51.280 --> 1:04:56.360]  the case it would be getting some more prescription drug programs so congressman
[1:04:56.360 --> 1:04:59.920]  now the Republicans are sticking together and opposing it stay there we can stop it
[1:04:59.920 --> 1:05:03.800]  great this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[1:05:03.800 --> 1:05:08.120]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[1:05:08.120 --> 1:05:12.520]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[1:05:12.520 --> 1:05:16.360]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[1:05:16.360 --> 1:05:20.240]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[1:05:20.240 --> 1:05:24.280]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:05:24.280 --> 1:05:28.680]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[1:05:28.680 --> 1:05:33.000]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:36.720]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[1:05:36.720 --> 1:05:40.880]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[1:05:40.880 --> 1:05:44.280]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[1:08:09.160 --> 1:08:31.280]  well his new books been out for months been at the top of the bestseller charts
[1:08:31.280 --> 1:08:38.040]  in the Fed and of course he had a number one New York Times bestseller his
[1:08:38.040 --> 1:08:43.280]  manifesto of freedom and you can find out a lot more at campaign for liberty
[1:08:43.280 --> 1:08:52.280]  Ron Paul again is our statesman our champion out there really exposing the
[1:08:52.280 --> 1:08:56.480]  fake Republican Party and the fake Democratic Party congressman getting
[1:08:56.480 --> 1:09:00.840]  back to health care here briefly you a month ago on the show you said you it
[1:09:00.840 --> 1:09:07.800]  looks like it probably will pass is that still your prognosis yes but I don't
[1:09:07.800 --> 1:09:11.840]  think anybody knows what will be in it I don't think it will be everything that
[1:09:11.840 --> 1:09:17.840]  Obama wanted you know and I wouldn't put a whole lot of money on exactly what's
[1:09:17.840 --> 1:09:21.200]  going to happen because you know the right to life people in the house are
[1:09:21.200 --> 1:09:25.600]  very very determined and Democrats you know Bart Stupak said he's gonna stick
[1:09:25.600 --> 1:09:30.160]  to his guns so maybe something good will come of all that but then again I
[1:09:30.160 --> 1:09:33.680]  think something something will pass the government is going to get more
[1:09:33.680 --> 1:09:41.160]  control of medical care in every poll you get Gallup polls of 99% against the
[1:09:41.160 --> 1:09:46.760]  banker bailout takeover of 2008 you you see 91% against open borders you see
[1:09:46.760 --> 1:09:51.320]  70 plus percent and not wanting government financed abortion but it all
[1:09:51.320 --> 1:09:57.520]  just continues even if the people are against it take take Copenhagen the
[1:09:57.520 --> 1:10:02.800]  Copenhagen Denmark event congressman as you know they couldn't get the treaty so
[1:10:02.800 --> 1:10:07.000]  Obama and Gordon Brown say they're just going to implement it at the executive
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:11.720]  level is this not tyranny it is and they do a lot of that and they've been
[1:10:11.720 --> 1:10:16.720]  doing it for a lot of years a executive orders probably about 99% of those are
[1:10:16.720 --> 1:10:20.360]  illegal there are some conditions where a president's a lot of issue an
[1:10:20.360 --> 1:10:24.920]  executive order but you you have the executive orders you have the signing
[1:10:24.920 --> 1:10:29.080]  statements and I mentioned before about how agencies of government
[1:10:29.080 --> 1:10:34.440]  legislate that's unconstitutional and it's just growing by leaps and bounds and
[1:10:34.440 --> 1:10:39.800]  excuse me and when you think about what the CIA does and how we run our foreign
[1:10:39.800 --> 1:10:46.120]  policy it's all out of control and it seems from studying history that that's
[1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:51.600]  what tyrannies do they just get you trained to accept corruption no one is
[1:10:51.600 --> 1:10:57.520]  for it but they just do it and the people kind of get a broken mindset or
[1:10:57.520 --> 1:11:03.040]  broken attitude and I've seen polls in Europe of 76 percent against the naked
[1:11:03.040 --> 1:11:06.760]  body scanners we have medical reports that it does bombard your body with
[1:11:06.760 --> 1:11:12.240]  dangerous radiation the media blurs the images but we've posted and gotten the
[1:11:12.240 --> 1:11:18.520]  real images complete images of women's breast genitalia men's genitals this is
[1:11:18.520 --> 1:11:23.200]  a literal recording of your naked body England has to change their law the
[1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:27.640]  Guardian reports because it is child pornography under their laws I mean who
[1:11:27.640 --> 1:11:32.520]  would imagine Stalin putting people through naked body scanners congressman
[1:11:32.520 --> 1:11:38.880]  can you speak to that a and b could you sponsor a bill to to to have Congress
[1:11:38.880 --> 1:11:44.160]  get control of the TSA and and and and not let them put in these machines and
[1:11:44.160 --> 1:11:47.600]  we have churned off making money off the company that got the government
[1:11:47.600 --> 1:11:51.600]  contracts I mean this is just incredible conflicts of interest we've already had a
[1:11:51.600 --> 1:11:56.400]  vote in the house on this to ban these these scanners and they passed in the
[1:11:56.400 --> 1:12:00.760]  house so that represented what the people were saying that was several
[1:12:00.760 --> 1:12:06.000]  months ago but it's almost like this is the reaction to it we need to prove that
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:12.160]  we need these machines and they have this incident come up so no I think the
[1:12:12.160 --> 1:12:17.760]  people back then said one thing but now they're using the tactic you were
[1:12:17.760 --> 1:12:22.760]  wondering why why do the people you know go along and even though there it
[1:12:22.760 --> 1:12:26.280]  seems like they're opposed to it I think the reason the people finally go along
[1:12:26.280 --> 1:12:31.360]  even though their numbers are against it is because of fear I mean the government
[1:12:31.360 --> 1:12:34.480]  knows how to build up fear you know fear of the financial collapse of this
[1:12:34.480 --> 1:12:39.200]  system oh yeah that's why we have to bail everybody out fear that those that
[1:12:39.200 --> 1:12:43.520]  Osama bin Laden is on the verge of having a nuclear weapon and Saddam Hussein is
[1:12:43.520 --> 1:12:48.440]  going to bomb Washington DC is always fear fear fear and then the people get
[1:12:48.440 --> 1:12:52.880]  frightened and then they give sacrifice their their liberties and it's a
[1:12:52.880 --> 1:12:59.000]  continuous process so it's a it's a hard thing to combat but hopefully we'll
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:03.600]  be able to do it so carbon dioxide is going to kill us we've got to have a
[1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:08.160]  world government and a world tax to save us the swine flu is going to kill us
[1:13:08.160 --> 1:13:12.240]  it's killed right around 11% so far according to the Associated Press with
[1:13:12.240 --> 1:13:16.680]  the regular seasonal flu does but we've got to have those forced inoculations in
[1:13:16.680 --> 1:13:22.200]  New York and Massachusetts that failed it does seem that they're selling of
[1:13:22.200 --> 1:13:26.120]  fear though is having less and less effect and that people are starting to
[1:13:26.120 --> 1:13:29.640]  get wise to it yeah this is it and this is the great thing has happened is the
[1:13:29.640 --> 1:13:33.960]  loss of credibility of government and this this comes along with the
[1:13:33.960 --> 1:13:38.560]  acknowledgement the government is bankrupt and and that both parties are
[1:13:38.560 --> 1:13:42.760]  bankrupt because governments make promises and they can't fulfill them
[1:13:42.760 --> 1:13:47.920]  even these foreign policy adventures adventurism that's that's not going to
[1:13:47.920 --> 1:13:50.880]  pan out either there'll be a point where you can't afford it that's why the
[1:13:50.880 --> 1:13:54.480]  Soviets left it isn't because we fought them they finally the economic system
[1:13:54.480 --> 1:13:59.280]  could be sustained and there's as much concern on the left as there is on the
[1:13:59.280 --> 1:14:02.720]  right about government and its credibility because the people on the
[1:14:02.720 --> 1:14:06.920]  left say hey maybe my benefits aren't going to come if it's true that social
[1:14:06.920 --> 1:14:10.280]  security is bankrupt and where are they going to get this money for all this
[1:14:10.280 --> 1:14:14.480]  medical bill you know eventually they're starting to wake up because
[1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:18.880]  government is losing their credibility and I think this is very very healthy
[1:14:18.880 --> 1:14:24.360]  but our job is not just to harp on on their their total failure as much as to
[1:14:24.360 --> 1:14:28.000]  say what are we going to do about it is there an answer to this and this is
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:32.960]  where when I talk on college campuses they're delighted to hear that there are
[1:14:32.960 --> 1:14:37.760]  alternative there are things to do and I am convinced in my own mind that if we
[1:14:37.760 --> 1:14:41.960]  had truly a free society and sound money and limited government and a sensible
[1:14:41.960 --> 1:14:47.400]  foreign policy and we just got out of the way and everybody got you know lost
[1:14:47.400 --> 1:14:52.440]  75% of their wealth tomorrow but they were left alone I think I think we'd
[1:14:52.440 --> 1:14:56.720]  recover quickly quicker than anybody would ever dream up so the whole issue
[1:14:56.720 --> 1:15:01.360]  is how free we can be and whether we can take we have self-reliance and take
[1:15:01.360 --> 1:15:05.160]  care of ourselves and push us back to depending on local communities and
[1:15:05.160 --> 1:15:10.360]  family it is so remarkable how successful that is but unfortunately our
[1:15:10.360 --> 1:15:15.520]  country has lost confidence in that but now the question is being asked if
[1:15:15.520 --> 1:15:19.840]  government can't deliver what is the option too often though they're saying
[1:15:19.840 --> 1:15:24.680]  you know the people that you fight all the time are the one-world people you
[1:15:24.680 --> 1:15:28.960]  know oh yes there is a crisis a financial crisis that means we need a
[1:15:28.960 --> 1:15:35.160]  single central bank for the whole world but the other option is maybe
[1:15:35.160 --> 1:15:40.720]  introducing the notion of gold and silver coins here in the United States like
[1:15:40.720 --> 1:15:47.160]  the Constitution mandates congressman a few minutes ago you alluded to the fact
[1:15:47.160 --> 1:15:50.440]  that they couldn't get their multi-billion dollar airport scanners in
[1:15:50.440 --> 1:15:56.000]  people were refusing and mash and so magically Christmas Day I heard on the
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:00.200]  radio about the underwear bomber and then I talked to eyewitnesses they
[1:16:00.200 --> 1:16:03.920]  didn't hear an explosion they saw another man on board the flight they saw a
[1:16:03.920 --> 1:16:09.640]  man lead the underwear bomber onto the flight in Amsterdam they had body
[1:16:09.640 --> 1:16:14.680]  scanners in Amsterdam he bypassed security the underwear bombers father
[1:16:14.680 --> 1:16:20.040]  said he was training in Yemen but he wasn't put on the watch list on and on
[1:16:20.040 --> 1:16:26.320]  and on and and you talk about letting this happen or how convenient that this
[1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:30.760]  came along even Russia Limbaugh now admits there's a global government
[1:16:30.760 --> 1:16:35.640]  forming and he admits that the government wants to wreck society so that
[1:16:35.640 --> 1:16:39.680]  we all become dependent on them so the good news is mainline conservatives are
[1:16:39.680 --> 1:16:43.680]  now finally having to admit what you've been talking about for 20 30 years what
[1:16:43.680 --> 1:16:49.200]  I've been talking about for 14 years but can you speak to creating crises or
[1:16:49.200 --> 1:16:54.560]  using existing crises or letting terrorists hit us you know Gulf of
[1:16:54.560 --> 1:16:59.640]  Tonkin was staged never happened 53 overthrowing Iran by funding radical
[1:16:59.640 --> 1:17:04.000]  Muslims to attack the government I mean we know who has the motive in all of
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:08.640]  this and within minutes of the underwear bombing report Sunday it came on
[1:17:08.640 --> 1:17:12.960]  Fox News Radio I was listening with my family on Christmas and they said don't
[1:17:12.960 --> 1:17:17.120]  worry the scanners are going in next month I mean you talk about perfect
[1:17:17.120 --> 1:17:22.400]  timing yeah I mean the question is whether or not government could be that
[1:17:22.400 --> 1:17:26.520]  inept and sometimes I think they're quite capable of being beer very inept
[1:17:26.520 --> 1:17:31.680]  rather than just conspiracy people who have planned every single thing but
[1:17:31.680 --> 1:17:37.120]  there are events that occur and they make good use of them but really can they
[1:17:37.120 --> 1:17:42.560]  be this inept and you know that it just seems like they can't be that that
[1:17:42.560 --> 1:17:48.920]  stupid who missed so many warning signs in here and I've been harping on this
[1:17:48.920 --> 1:17:54.040]  is that every year we spend $75 billion on it gathering intelligence to try to
[1:17:54.040 --> 1:17:58.000]  protect our country from being hit of course they won't talk about foreign
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:02.120]  policy then they get this hot lead they thought yeah we knew about that guy we
[1:18:02.120 --> 1:18:06.320]  were warned about him and it wouldn't have cost it would have a cost to cost of
[1:18:06.320 --> 1:18:11.640]  a telephone call and say you know why don't you watch this guy you know but
[1:18:11.640 --> 1:18:17.320]  where does the $75 billion go to collect all this intelligence it seems to me
[1:18:17.320 --> 1:18:22.760]  like we don't have very many intelligent people analyzing this unless
[1:18:22.760 --> 1:18:27.920]  somebody's in the business of allowing these things to go forward which is you
[1:18:27.920 --> 1:18:32.880]  know gonna be hard to prove one way the other well my issue is this let's say
[1:18:32.880 --> 1:18:36.600]  there's real terrorists that blow up a few airlines every year I would rather
[1:18:36.600 --> 1:18:40.560]  and I've seen the polls so would everybody else walk right onto those
[1:18:40.560 --> 1:18:43.520]  planes and have the chance that's gonna happen I mean I get on the highway
[1:18:43.520 --> 1:18:47.280]  every day that's the number one cause of death I take my children on the highway
[1:18:47.280 --> 1:18:51.360]  at 70 miles an hour with big 18 wheelers right beside me I routinely
[1:18:51.360 --> 1:18:57.880]  yesterday drove past an overturned 18 wheeler that was a fatality I mean do I
[1:18:57.880 --> 1:19:02.800]  suddenly start chewing my fingernails and say naked body scam me you know record
[1:19:02.800 --> 1:19:07.160]  my naked children in the body scanner I mean it's ridiculous that may that may
[1:19:07.160 --> 1:19:12.320]  be logical logical but it won't pass politically to take that out they will
[1:19:12.320 --> 1:19:17.880]  consider this that you're not really concerned but what what I do instead
[1:19:17.880 --> 1:19:21.840]  even though I'm not saying that what you're saying is wrong what I'm saying
[1:19:21.840 --> 1:19:24.880]  is that there's an alternative I don't believe the government should be
[1:19:24.880 --> 1:19:31.680]  involved in in giving us our privacy or you know our our safety and the
[1:19:31.680 --> 1:19:34.960]  government doesn't give us our safety in our houses or our building or our
[1:19:34.960 --> 1:19:39.400]  farms or you know our business establishment or our chemical plants
[1:19:39.400 --> 1:19:44.440]  but you know on the airplanes if the airlines were responsible there is
[1:19:44.440 --> 1:19:48.960]  technology available now that every individual could be issued something no
[1:19:48.960 --> 1:19:53.920]  bigger than a cell phone and it would be your identification badge the airline
[1:19:53.920 --> 1:19:59.400]  can have that registered so they say oh I know your little gadget there belongs
[1:19:59.400 --> 1:20:02.600]  to Ron Paul so I want you to put your fingerprint on it you put your
[1:20:02.600 --> 1:20:06.320]  fingerprint on it and they get the recording they have no record of your
[1:20:06.320 --> 1:20:09.640]  fingerprint no records kept the government doesn't know anything about it
[1:20:09.640 --> 1:20:15.400]  but I'm a frequent flyer but I have my passport you know I have a card which I
[1:20:15.400 --> 1:20:20.760]  have voluntarily gotten it's a corporate passport only I can turn that turn that
[1:20:20.760 --> 1:20:25.400]  ID badge on and that technology is available so we I mean that at least
[1:20:25.400 --> 1:20:28.920]  would take care of 90% even if you didn't fly a whole lot you could get
[1:20:28.920 --> 1:20:32.800]  free screen for this that's what I would do if I was running the airlines I wouldn't
[1:20:32.800 --> 1:20:37.440]  say oh anybody come on you know I'd be very careful you know but congressman we
[1:20:37.440 --> 1:20:42.520]  know what's really happening take Austin Texas 150 million spent on capital
[1:20:42.520 --> 1:20:48.040]  metro that 1% of the city rides at a cost over $35 per ride the person pays
[1:20:48.040 --> 1:20:53.280]  to and 70 million is spent on Austin roads so more than double the money is
[1:20:53.280 --> 1:21:00.400]  spent because the government gets to control the buses then what what all the
[1:21:00.400 --> 1:21:06.200]  rest the people are using cars they only get half of the money or less of their
[1:21:06.200 --> 1:21:10.240]  own tax money and it's the same thing with big government big government with
[1:21:10.240 --> 1:21:13.960]  revolving doors with homeland security people they're all making money as
[1:21:13.960 --> 1:21:17.760]  consultants they recommend the body scanners and the surveillance and then
[1:21:17.760 --> 1:21:21.800]  they make money off of it it's criminal yeah there's no doubt about it when I
[1:21:21.800 --> 1:21:24.640]  heard that thing about Chernoff it's hard to believe that somebody was
[1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:29.920]  interviewing him like oh by the way I know you run this and how did how did
[1:21:29.920 --> 1:21:33.800]  you guys know that this was so important it was like he was really smart
[1:21:33.800 --> 1:21:38.720]  they figured this out it wasn't like is there a conflict of interest and that
[1:21:38.720 --> 1:21:42.280]  that question never even came up when he was being interviewed well that's like
[1:21:42.280 --> 1:21:46.040]  in Congress whenever Paulson the head of the Treasury they'd say well you got
[1:21:46.040 --> 1:21:49.360]  tens of millions of dollars of your own bailout money he'd say I gave myself a
[1:21:49.360 --> 1:21:55.640]  waiver and made it legal huh I mean can I give myself a waiver congressman to
[1:21:55.640 --> 1:21:59.600]  rob banks you know they gave that I can't remember which company it was but
[1:21:59.600 --> 1:22:03.040]  they were bankrupt and we bailed them out and all and they still had a tax
[1:22:03.040 --> 1:22:07.360]  problem so they just wrote taxes off you know hundreds of millions of dollars
[1:22:07.360 --> 1:22:11.600]  no okay those last three years taxes you had a lot of trouble so you don't have
[1:22:11.600 --> 1:22:16.080]  to pay those taxes can you imagine if if you had a tax problem and you had
[1:22:16.080 --> 1:22:21.800]  the difficulty with the IRS we know you had trouble so you don't have to pay
[1:22:21.800 --> 1:22:28.080]  those back taxes but that's the way the system works unfortunately doctor Ron
[1:22:28.080 --> 1:22:32.600]  Paul comes from Ron Paul joining us got about eight minutes left here sir I saw
[1:22:32.600 --> 1:22:37.120]  a Bloomberg report where Goldman Sachs is arming its employees literally against
[1:22:37.120 --> 1:22:42.840]  the public with pitchforks in Washington are they starting to get the same sense
[1:22:42.840 --> 1:22:48.000]  that Wall Street is that the people are recognizing their criminal activity
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:52.880]  passing unconstitutional bills without even reading it because it seems that
[1:22:52.880 --> 1:22:56.640]  washington's only getting more criminal they don't seem to care or is it more
[1:22:56.640 --> 1:23:00.280]  like rats running off the sinking ship with the loot
[1:23:00.280 --> 1:23:05.800]  well there's some of that I I work on the assumption that Washington is usually
[1:23:05.800 --> 1:23:11.960]  about 10 15 years behind what the people are thinking so I I don't think a person
[1:23:11.960 --> 1:23:16.240]  like Nancy Pelosi is aware of what the people are really thinking you know if
[1:23:16.240 --> 1:23:21.520]  she heard about the Tea Party movement I mean she writes that off that's one
[1:23:21.520 --> 1:23:26.160]  or two percent of the population in our own nuts and and she just totally
[1:23:26.160 --> 1:23:31.840]  dismisses it so that's where generally Washington is I I just don't think that
[1:23:31.840 --> 1:23:36.040]  they're quite aware of what's happening with the grassroots and and I think
[1:23:36.040 --> 1:23:40.840]  that's where the real changes are occurring and of course I'm always
[1:23:40.840 --> 1:23:45.520]  hopeful that there's real changes with the young people so that's why I keep
[1:23:45.520 --> 1:23:51.360]  talking to myself so that I'm always hopeful speaking of hopefulness
[1:23:51.360 --> 1:23:57.960]  Iceland it looks like may say no we're not gonna pay off private debt England
[1:23:57.960 --> 1:24:02.600]  is listing all Icelanders basically as terrorists they can grab and hold the
[1:24:02.600 --> 1:24:07.640]  money that's in British banks Goldman Sachs has been caught engineering that
[1:24:07.640 --> 1:24:12.400]  crisis that's come out in the news I mean shouldn't we just tell these private
[1:24:12.400 --> 1:24:16.520]  banks we're not gonna give you any more bailout money well that we should have
[1:24:16.520 --> 1:24:21.920]  never given it in the first place and we shouldn't give any more besides pretty
[1:24:21.920 --> 1:24:25.880]  soon it'll be worthless and won't matter much so the more you give away create
[1:24:25.880 --> 1:24:30.200]  money out there more you give away you may temporarily help some of their
[1:24:30.200 --> 1:24:34.280]  friends but it's just more of the same thing that's how we got in this trouble
[1:24:34.280 --> 1:24:39.160]  that's how they're gonna keep it going a lot of economists are saying we could
[1:24:39.160 --> 1:24:42.480]  have total depression within the next year the real economy over 20% on
[1:24:42.480 --> 1:24:46.080]  employment all the numbers that I know you're well aware of are really bad all
[1:24:46.080 --> 1:24:49.680]  the mainstream media says this is a great economy because the big banks are
[1:24:49.680 --> 1:24:54.880]  making money off the bailout the dollars continuing its slide went up for a
[1:24:54.880 --> 1:24:58.880]  little bit but still overall it's going down where do you see us in two years
[1:24:58.880 --> 1:25:03.280]  congressman I think we're going to be much poorer as a nation I think
[1:25:03.280 --> 1:25:06.520]  unemployment rates are going to stay very high I think by two years it'll be
[1:25:06.520 --> 1:25:10.900]  acknowledged that there was no recovery I thought there were some very good
[1:25:10.900 --> 1:25:16.080]  articles and I commented on one this past week about Paul Krugman you know
[1:25:16.080 --> 1:25:20.760]  he analyzed the past ten years he had a good analysis we're all worse off the
[1:25:20.760 --> 1:25:25.960]  real employment has you know real income has not gone up and investments have not
[1:25:25.960 --> 1:25:30.400]  gone up he did say that you'd be an even Steven on your stocks from ten years
[1:25:30.400 --> 1:25:34.640]  ago but yeah actually lower if you take into account the inflation you're down
[1:25:34.640 --> 1:25:39.640]  about 20% but of course he said what we needed was more spending and more
[1:25:39.640 --> 1:25:44.720]  regulations and that would have solved all that problem but no I think it
[1:25:44.720 --> 1:25:48.680]  started ten years ago I think we started slipping into the recession
[1:25:48.680 --> 1:25:55.320]  depression I think there's no signs that we have reverse things it may they
[1:25:55.320 --> 1:25:59.760]  talk themselves into thinking things are improving when when the dot-com bubble
[1:25:59.760 --> 1:26:03.800]  burst they didn't allow the correction to occur so they created a housing bubble
[1:26:03.800 --> 1:26:07.920]  well they started feeling better but it didn't solve the problem now a lot of
[1:26:07.920 --> 1:26:13.440]  people don't have houses it but you don't believe gold is a bubble no I
[1:26:13.440 --> 1:26:17.400]  don't believe that I think so that's an inflationary issue that I think gold
[1:26:17.400 --> 1:26:24.160]  or gold reflects if anything is it's way behind because the bubble is the the
[1:26:24.160 --> 1:26:28.160]  size of the dollars created that the real bubble I think is in the bond market
[1:26:28.160 --> 1:26:32.640]  because the price of bonds are so good because the interest rates are so low
[1:26:32.640 --> 1:26:37.760]  but but that's that's just being held together I think this is what the Fed
[1:26:37.760 --> 1:26:41.840]  does in collusion with other central banks as they prop that market up but
[1:26:41.840 --> 1:26:48.600]  so if gold the market will rule pardon me I'm sorry so if gold met inflation what
[1:26:48.600 --> 1:26:53.760]  it'd be like $2,500 an ounce it would be a lot a lot higher the market I don't
[1:26:53.760 --> 1:26:58.520]  think the market's been allowed to adjust to that yet I think there's that's
[1:26:58.520 --> 1:27:01.720]  that's the other thing that an audit might reveal is how much they're
[1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:05.600]  involved in the gold market because they the governments have always been
[1:27:05.600 --> 1:27:10.480]  involved in gold even when they had gold in thousand years ago the government
[1:27:10.480 --> 1:27:15.160]  you know the Kings would with the dilute the matter or clip the coins and do
[1:27:15.160 --> 1:27:22.000]  different things and if you know up in the in the in 71 we dump gold to try to
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:26.680]  keep gold at $35 an ounce and that was a joke and now they absolutely they do it
[1:27:26.680 --> 1:27:30.920]  a different way now but they're working very hard they they know that a high
[1:27:30.920 --> 1:27:36.000]  price of gold is a vote against paper and they can't allow the people to
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:40.680]  question the paper money because their kingdom is finished when the people
[1:27:40.680 --> 1:27:46.920]  request in it they're only beginning the question so if anything gold is a
[1:27:46.920 --> 1:27:51.960]  long way from a bubble the real bubble is in the size of the currency market
[1:27:51.960 --> 1:27:55.240]  and the value of the dollar is artificially high and the bonds are
[1:27:55.240 --> 1:27:59.280]  artificially high congressman I totally agree with you in the last minute and a
[1:27:59.280 --> 1:28:03.400]  half we've got left homeschoolers in California they ruled a couple years
[1:28:03.400 --> 1:28:06.920]  ago that homeschooling is a privilege that the state owns their children that
[1:28:06.920 --> 1:28:11.280]  got overturned CBS News reports these people moved to the town didn't
[1:28:11.280 --> 1:28:16.320]  register their kids it was a civil matter then but the CPS said yeah but
[1:28:16.320 --> 1:28:20.840]  that's child endangerment and so they were arrested through color of law and
[1:28:20.840 --> 1:28:26.840]  the school is on television saying they deserve to go to jail I mean this is
[1:28:26.840 --> 1:28:30.880]  slavery in my view I mean if we can't raise our children and be left alone by
[1:28:30.880 --> 1:28:34.840]  the state we might as well be the Soviet Union yeah this is tyranny but
[1:28:34.840 --> 1:28:39.520]  unfortunately we sold that out a long time ago when we decided the federal
[1:28:39.520 --> 1:28:43.760]  government was involved in education always you know for these good reasons
[1:28:43.760 --> 1:28:48.480]  so once we allowed the government take charge of it you know there's been some
[1:28:48.480 --> 1:28:53.680]  up and downs they tried to really stop homeschooling in the early 80s and there
[1:28:53.680 --> 1:28:58.160]  was some court fights and we won those but no they will never give up on that
[1:28:58.160 --> 1:29:01.480]  they never give up on control of money they will never give up on the control
[1:29:01.480 --> 1:29:05.680]  of the education of the young children just think of how how they brainwash
[1:29:05.680 --> 1:29:10.760]  young children on global warming and some of this radical environmentalism so
[1:29:10.760 --> 1:29:15.720]  that's a big fight but hopefully it'll backfire on him and it'll just wake the
[1:29:15.720 --> 1:29:19.040]  people up because they're sure a lot of homeschoolers around these days and
[1:29:19.040 --> 1:29:22.320]  they're they're very strong in the Constitution they've learned the
[1:29:22.320 --> 1:29:25.120]  Constitution which they have never would never have learned in the public
[1:29:25.120 --> 1:29:29.200]  schools that's right there's many more homeschoolers now there were in the 80s
[1:29:29.200 --> 1:29:34.680]  we beat them back then the message is stand up against this tyranny and we
[1:29:34.680 --> 1:29:38.680]  can turn them around congressman Ron Paul thank you so much for joining us in

[1:31:04.280 --> 1:31:08.200]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[1:31:08.200 --> 1:31:12.440]  triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar wants to control how
[1:31:12.440 --> 1:31:16.720]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[1:31:16.720 --> 1:31:21.080]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[1:31:21.080 --> 1:31:25.160]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[1:31:25.160 --> 1:31:29.720]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[1:31:29.720 --> 1:31:33.840]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[1:31:33.840 --> 1:31:37.800]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[1:33:00.920 --> 1:33:11.920]  he's the T-Rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network okay we're
[1:33:11.920 --> 1:33:17.760]  gonna go to your phone calls Wilson Melody Frank Jim Michael and others and
[1:33:17.760 --> 1:33:22.360]  I'm gonna go over a ton of news we haven't even gotten to yet I have a report
[1:33:22.360 --> 1:33:27.480]  here with airline security the feds completely taking it over with the TSA
[1:33:27.480 --> 1:33:35.240]  unconstitutionally using it as a microcosm a cancer cell to spread out of
[1:33:35.240 --> 1:33:39.320]  the rest of society their unconstitutional federal takeover the
[1:33:39.320 --> 1:33:42.880]  feds themselves taken over by international interest completely unconstitutional
[1:33:42.880 --> 1:33:48.720]  explosives reached Ireland after failed test a quantity of explosive found in a
[1:33:48.720 --> 1:33:52.800]  flat on Dorset Street in Dublin this morning was brought into the country
[1:33:52.800 --> 1:33:58.480]  following a failed security operation in Slovakia they planted bombs on somebody
[1:33:58.480 --> 1:34:04.680]  in their bags as a test and it went through that's how the government stages
[1:34:04.680 --> 1:34:09.680]  terror attacks they pick some Muslim or somebody they don't like normally with
[1:34:09.680 --> 1:34:13.400]  criminal records so they look bad and they just put bombs on the airplane
[1:34:13.400 --> 1:34:17.200]  with them and blow the airplane up or bust them with it and the person says I
[1:34:17.200 --> 1:34:23.480]  have no idea this is how they do it over and over that's how a false flag is
[1:34:23.480 --> 1:34:29.800]  run that's one of their favorite ways to do it and they could do it to me they
[1:34:29.800 --> 1:34:36.140]  could plant a explosive on check bags that's why I never check bags and I
[1:34:36.140 --> 1:34:40.120]  fight with the airports and pay extra to carry two on and they try to grab them
[1:34:40.120 --> 1:34:43.400]  and take them away and almost every time I've been forced to check them they get
[1:34:43.400 --> 1:34:47.800]  lost and show up three or four days later after I've already left some city
[1:34:47.800 --> 1:34:52.080]  and then they've got to get mailed back to Austin and then I mean it just goes
[1:34:52.080 --> 1:34:58.040]  on and on and on with these people and you know Ron Paul reminded me something
[1:34:58.040 --> 1:35:06.680]  that that's huge that I had totally forgotten about the house passed a law
[1:35:06.680 --> 1:35:11.680]  last year that they couldn't do these body scans and they still just do it
[1:35:11.680 --> 1:35:17.280]  because the Senate didn't pass it the house doesn't want it the people don't
[1:35:17.280 --> 1:35:21.520]  want it I've looked at the way they ask these polls were 50 60% depending on the
[1:35:21.520 --> 1:35:25.160]  poll want the body scanners then it says do you want to increase high-tech
[1:35:25.160 --> 1:35:29.600]  security scanners for weapons that would ease how fast you go through the
[1:35:29.600 --> 1:35:33.840]  airport oh yes but if they say do you want the government to record your
[1:35:33.840 --> 1:35:39.800]  naked body and that of your children and store it in a database no 75 80 90
[1:35:39.800 --> 1:35:44.480]  percent depending on the poll they have polls where they ask it in the Guardian
[1:35:44.480 --> 1:35:49.400]  scientific poll where they ask it where most people would be for it and 76%
[1:35:49.400 --> 1:35:53.520]  were against it I've asked Watson to do a blurb on that so people can see it at
[1:35:53.520 --> 1:35:57.120]  prisonplanet.com house passes bill limiting the use of whole body
[1:35:57.120 --> 1:36:02.680]  scanners but they don't care later towards the end of the show I haven't
[1:36:02.680 --> 1:36:08.040]  launched the official contest yet I haven't launched the exact details I
[1:36:08.040 --> 1:36:16.400]  know I'm gonna do $5,000 for the best media stunt legal lawful stunt to
[1:36:16.400 --> 1:36:25.520]  expose the body scanners in your town in your city $10,000 for the best protest
[1:36:25.520 --> 1:36:31.640]  video of a protest at a federal building or on the edge of the property not on
[1:36:31.640 --> 1:36:43.640]  the property of an airport and my wife had the idea my wife hates Pita she
[1:36:43.640 --> 1:36:47.000]  wanted me to add that point she worked for him for a little while and she knows
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:53.840]  there rather go this was like 14 years ago she did some of the rather go naked
[1:36:53.840 --> 1:36:58.800]  than fur protests that were on the cover of us at a day you name it and she said
[1:36:58.800 --> 1:37:02.240]  that would really be effective to show how they're stripping you to show the
[1:37:02.240 --> 1:37:07.680]  public that this is a naked body scanner and you know I said preliminarily I said
[1:37:07.680 --> 1:37:10.600]  your stay I was still wasn't sure about the contest that that would probably be a
[1:37:10.600 --> 1:37:14.840]  great idea if people want to do that that's their issue as long as they
[1:37:14.840 --> 1:37:19.240]  check their local laws most places it's okay but that's you don't have to do
[1:37:19.240 --> 1:37:24.760]  that to be the winner it's I'm gonna judge it whatever the best protest is
[1:37:24.760 --> 1:37:29.120]  and again I got to develop this over the weekend right up the rules and launch it
[1:37:29.120 --> 1:37:34.680]  on Monday so the best stunt the best protest and that could be however you
[1:37:34.680 --> 1:37:41.200]  organize it however you do it and again it will be the video because we can't
[1:37:41.200 --> 1:37:46.600]  really judge a protest itself it's whoever goes to a protest organizes a
[1:37:46.600 --> 1:37:52.920]  protest and then makes the best video whoever makes the best video of the
[1:37:52.920 --> 1:37:56.880]  protest you're not winning the prize for the protest itself that's your first
[1:37:56.880 --> 1:38:01.160]  amendment right and if you choose to go out and do it you do all of us win by the
[1:38:01.160 --> 1:38:04.400]  hundreds of videos that will get made that will get posted that then tens of
[1:38:04.400 --> 1:38:08.080]  millions of people conservatively in a year sometimes in a week depending on how
[1:38:08.080 --> 1:38:13.360]  big these are we'll see five thousand for the best stunt that you videotape
[1:38:13.360 --> 1:38:20.480]  that's legal and lawful check your local laws ten thousand dollars for the best
[1:38:20.480 --> 1:38:26.640]  video of the best protest that you are part of and five thousand for the best
[1:38:26.640 --> 1:38:32.080]  poster against body scanning and big brother that you then post legally and
[1:38:32.080 --> 1:38:39.920]  lawfully in public places so I've got to write those up this weekend next week
[1:38:39.920 --> 1:38:46.160]  I'll announce the dates and how people do it I guess people seem to think alike
[1:38:46.160 --> 1:38:49.480]  was pointed out to me by Rob do I haven't seen the video yet that it was in
[1:38:49.480 --> 1:38:53.440]  some British newspapers that last weekend before we even thought of this
[1:38:53.440 --> 1:38:59.440]  simultaneously or separately that some folks did the topless protest and it
[1:38:59.440 --> 1:39:04.520]  made the news against the body scanners we can beat this Congress already had a
[1:39:04.520 --> 1:39:07.960]  house already passed the law against it but the Senate didn't we need to have it
[1:39:07.960 --> 1:39:12.160]  brought back up passed again in the new Congress I asked Ron Paul again to
[1:39:12.160 --> 1:39:17.480]  reintroduce it hopefully he'll do that and we can get the Senate to go along with
[1:39:17.480 --> 1:39:21.920]  this I mean this is a big deal folks an active submission to government so we're
[1:39:21.920 --> 1:39:27.720]  going to your phone calls throughout this hour into the next hour and into the
[1:39:27.720 --> 1:39:33.920]  hour following that we've got two hours and 40 minutes 30 seconds left in this
[1:39:33.920 --> 1:39:39.360]  worldwide broadcast but again anybody that enters these contests anybody that
[1:39:39.360 --> 1:39:43.400]  takes action you win because you're strengthening the Liberty muscles you're
[1:39:43.400 --> 1:39:47.720]  getting involved it's like jogging at first you can't jog a mile pretty soon
[1:39:47.720 --> 1:39:52.480]  you can jog five miles pretty soon you can run a marathon it's the act of going
[1:39:52.480 --> 1:39:57.120]  out and resisting and saying I don't agree with this this is big brother this
[1:39:57.120 --> 1:40:03.360]  is wrong also in the last 30 minutes of the show I'm gonna break down another
[1:40:03.360 --> 1:40:07.920]  facet of the eugenicist and Bernard Shaw and others we're gonna have Aaron Dyke's
[1:40:07.920 --> 1:40:13.800]  in studio with us but I'm about to go to your calls I first want to put the call
[1:40:13.800 --> 1:40:19.920]  out to listeners to financially support us I can't do $20,000 contest which
[1:40:19.920 --> 1:40:24.120]  have all been incredibly successful even the smaller contest it reaching
[1:40:24.120 --> 1:40:28.360]  millions of people unless we get funds and support and that's what I do I'm
[1:40:28.360 --> 1:40:32.360]  expanding our studios expanding our office hiring more people upgrading the
[1:40:32.360 --> 1:40:38.720]  websites adding more for prison planet TV members just continually trying to
[1:40:38.720 --> 1:40:42.680]  expand what we do and I don't think there's any place in the fight against
[1:40:42.680 --> 1:40:48.760]  the New World Order any facet of what anybody does out there against the
[1:40:48.760 --> 1:40:54.400]  globalist that pound for pound dollar for dollar political action for political
[1:40:54.400 --> 1:41:00.200]  action is more effective than what we do with this multimedia radio TV shows my
[1:41:00.200 --> 1:41:05.320]  films the news websites and how we teach people and show people how to be
[1:41:05.320 --> 1:41:10.600]  effective and politically active and shatter the left right paradigm so how
[1:41:10.600 --> 1:41:13.760]  do you support us and how do you get great powerful films that'll wake up your
[1:41:13.760 --> 1:41:16.760]  friends families and your neighbors there's nothing more valuable than

[1:42:58.360 --> 1:43:02.560]  me your take on the secret conference committee in the house and Senate not
[1:43:02.560 --> 1:43:05.720]  letting the public see it Obama promising to do it under pressure saying
[1:43:05.720 --> 1:43:09.440]  okay of all these days and days of meetings you'll get to see one hour of
[1:43:09.440 --> 1:43:15.000]  staged prepared statements and none of the secret activity going on in the
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:20.080]  criminal government what do you think about the body scanners about home
[1:43:20.080 --> 1:43:26.160]  schoolers being arrested and I want to stand up for this family they're talking
[1:43:26.160 --> 1:43:29.440]  about taking and we're going to your calls I want to give these numbers out
[1:43:29.440 --> 1:43:36.800]  first they are take they're talking about taking this family's children they
[1:43:36.800 --> 1:43:45.520]  are talking about in New York state and the Fonda Fultonville school superintendent
[1:43:45.520 --> 1:43:50.040]  they sent police to their house because they didn't register their children with
[1:43:50.040 --> 1:43:54.240]  homeschooling which was a civil matter I've read the law printed it off
[1:43:54.240 --> 1:44:01.160]  yesterday but the CPS this shows their tyranny there's no logits yelling at
[1:44:01.160 --> 1:44:07.760]  your kids no logits spanking them but they can then decide if yelling or if not
[1:44:07.760 --> 1:44:11.320]  putting them in public school or not registering them if that's endangerment
[1:44:11.320 --> 1:44:16.920]  so the CPS agent and the and the judge becomes judge jury and executioner and
[1:44:16.920 --> 1:44:21.920]  God inside the eugenics cults set up about 110 years ago right around there
[1:44:21.920 --> 1:44:26.120]  in different states in the United States 120 years ago in England for racial
[1:44:26.120 --> 1:44:31.120]  hygiene everything that George Bernard Shaw talked about the big head liberal
[1:44:31.120 --> 1:44:34.560]  here in the US how they would set up these family courts and then take
[1:44:34.560 --> 1:44:38.520]  everybody's kids in the state within the family and anyone who didn't produce or
[1:44:38.520 --> 1:44:42.360]  when you got old they would just kill you he actually says all this the video
[1:44:42.360 --> 1:44:49.280]  of him saying it is coming up in the last hour today the diabolicalness of
[1:44:49.280 --> 1:44:53.280]  these people and so they're persecuting them they're trying to take their
[1:44:53.280 --> 1:45:05.040]  children right now this family is in between a rock and a hard place it is
[1:45:05.040 --> 1:45:09.800]  the Cressy family we've seen emails from the police and superintendent and
[1:45:09.800 --> 1:45:13.240]  others to locals Burmese actually went to school in this town this is where
[1:45:13.240 --> 1:45:19.920]  Jason Burmese has lived and went to college and it's just amazing and
[1:45:19.920 --> 1:45:26.040]  and the superintendent's like well we had one case where a 18 year old couldn't
[1:45:26.040 --> 1:45:29.840]  read after homeschooling that's always the PR that homeschoolers don't get
[1:45:29.840 --> 1:45:33.680]  taught when statistically they're the best that's out there and I have the
[1:45:33.680 --> 1:45:37.400]  article out of France where yelling at your husband or wife you get arrested
[1:45:37.400 --> 1:45:42.800]  for not cussing no no just yelling that encourages wives and husbands to tattle
[1:45:42.800 --> 1:45:46.240]  on each other they said well we've had a hundred and fifty something deaths in
[1:45:46.240 --> 1:45:50.880]  2008 the statistics are always a year old of husband and wives killing each
[1:45:50.880 --> 1:45:54.400]  other so if somebody out of sixty million sixty one million five hundred
[1:45:54.400 --> 1:45:58.480]  thousand people sixty one million five hundred thousand people in France if a
[1:45:58.480 --> 1:46:02.440]  hundred and fifty something people I read the statistics yesterday kill each
[1:46:02.440 --> 1:46:06.760]  other then everyone loses their rights and everyone's a slave if there's one
[1:46:06.760 --> 1:46:12.080]  underwear firecracker bomber everybody's got to be naked that body scanned if one
[1:46:12.080 --> 1:46:15.520]  person shows explosives in their body everyone's got to be x-rayed they're
[1:46:15.520 --> 1:46:19.200]  now calling for that they always push it further oh you don't want to be body
[1:46:19.200 --> 1:46:23.480]  scanned how about x-rayed okay we want x-ray you will just body scan you but then
[1:46:23.480 --> 1:46:29.400]  two years later now we're gonna x-ray you at some airports they actually do a
[1:46:29.400 --> 1:46:33.720]  proctology exam they actually put a glove on and go into you I mean they take
[1:46:33.720 --> 1:46:38.240]  your laptops all over the news for five years when you flyer and they just take
[1:46:38.240 --> 1:46:41.680]  them and download their contents and send them to you months later they order
[1:46:41.680 --> 1:46:44.520]  people to give them their email passcodes and sit there and read it in front of
[1:46:44.520 --> 1:46:49.600]  them I have news reports here we're working reporters are seeing men stand
[1:46:49.600 --> 1:46:53.960]  around pull out hot blondes put them in the naked body scanner and sit around
[1:46:53.960 --> 1:46:58.000]  laughing and smiling I see it on the news images of a woman being scanned and the
[1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:02.800]  guys are looking at the screen going I mean this is sick who do you think

[1:47:29.240 --> 1:47:33.560]  didn't do that you arrested them for a stunt under child endangerment this is
[1:47:33.560 --> 1:47:37.200]  outrageous and the American people know what you did and every commenter on the

[1:53:08.840 --> 1:53:11.960]  you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more

[1:54:12.200 --> 1:54:16.480]  Wilson in Florida thanks for holding her on the air worldwide
[1:54:16.480 --> 1:54:21.280]  hey good afternoon Alex happy new year too I haven't spoke to you since the
[1:54:21.280 --> 1:54:25.440]  new year but I just was saying I want to say that you had a wonderful interview
[1:54:25.440 --> 1:54:29.920]  with Ron Paul I really liked it and I got a quick question you said Lord
[1:54:29.920 --> 1:54:33.320]  of Moncton was like the George Washington in this fight what would you
[1:54:33.320 --> 1:54:39.440]  consider Ron Paul then I said Moncton was the George Washington in the climate
[1:54:39.440 --> 1:54:46.880]  change fight specifically specifically in that area no one has done more leading
[1:54:46.880 --> 1:54:52.200]  the people exposing the fraud he's been doing it for 15 years at least so I
[1:54:52.200 --> 1:54:56.760]  didn't mean overall fighting the New World Order and I know that Moncton likes
[1:54:56.760 --> 1:55:01.640]  our founding fathers he's Scottish he's criticized tyranny in England and so that
[1:55:01.640 --> 1:55:06.120]  was the point I was making people don't know that in the UK in England some of
[1:55:06.120 --> 1:55:09.320]  our biggest supporters in Revolutionary War were in England so that was the point
[1:55:09.320 --> 1:55:13.400]  you know by saying George Washington of the climate change fight this is a
[1:55:13.400 --> 1:55:21.120]  global fight Ron Paul is a polite intelligent focused elder statesman and
[1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:30.880]  I wouldn't call him I wouldn't call him a George Washington I would perhaps a
[1:55:30.880 --> 1:55:38.600]  Thomas Jefferson perhaps John Quincy Adams or something I don't know what
[1:55:38.600 --> 1:55:43.760]  do you think I'm not too great on the history even though I said it was a
[1:55:43.760 --> 1:55:48.240]  founding fathers but and one last question you I'm not sure if you've
[1:55:48.240 --> 1:55:55.440]  seen Ben Stein on TV called Ron Paul anti-Semitic yes do you think that he's
[1:55:55.440 --> 1:56:00.360]  gonna debate Ron Paul I don't think he will he won't come on this show we've
[1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:03.480]  challenged him to and Ben Stein made a great film about the environmentalist
[1:56:03.480 --> 1:56:09.600]  being eugenicist and so we want to demon in a friendly way but that's all that the
[1:56:09.600 --> 1:56:14.400]  neocons have and that's all the Israel lobby has if you I mean Ron Paul is
[1:56:14.400 --> 1:56:18.840]  against all foreign aid he's against it for Egypt he's against it for China he's
[1:56:18.840 --> 1:56:23.200]  against it for Nigeria he's against it from Brazil he's against 25 billion to
[1:56:23.200 --> 1:56:27.400]  General Motors to literally spend at least 3 billion of it to ship it to
[1:56:27.400 --> 1:56:32.000]  China Eastern Europe and Brazil it's not because he hates Brazilians he's not
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:37.440]  anti-Brazilian and so that's why the ADL and others are being totally
[1:56:37.440 --> 1:56:41.600]  discredited because you say I don't want to bake or bail out oh you don't like
[1:56:41.600 --> 1:56:46.280]  Jews oh I don't you know want a police state oh you don't like Jews and they're
[1:56:46.280 --> 1:56:50.960]  actually creating anti-Semitism by always injecting Jews into everything
[1:56:50.960 --> 1:56:56.760]  and making Jews take the side of New World Order it's really it's it doesn't
[1:56:56.760 --> 1:57:02.680]  work anymore they call everybody anti-Semitic I mean you know the ADL
[1:57:02.680 --> 1:57:06.440]  attacks me they don't dare call me anti-Semitic as I've had my lawyer put
[1:57:06.440 --> 1:57:10.880]  them on notice of a tort if they ever do it one time when they did and they
[1:57:10.880 --> 1:57:14.160]  retracted and they've lost lawsuits before by the way because of these
[1:57:14.160 --> 1:57:17.840]  activities with other people so they always try to just call me an extremist
[1:57:17.840 --> 1:57:23.200]  and the king of conspiracy and all of this stuff but people need to watch
[1:57:23.200 --> 1:57:29.720]  themselves because you know that is a horrible slur and slander to just throw
[1:57:29.720 --> 1:57:35.400]  on someone calling them an anti-Semite and it and again and Jewish groups
[1:57:35.400 --> 1:57:44.240]  continue to speak for Jews and inject anti-Semitism into every issue and it's
[1:57:44.240 --> 1:57:50.480]  just completely disastrous for them well I don't want to make one final point
[1:57:50.480 --> 1:57:55.440]  that going into the year 2009 I was able to talk to you on New Year's Eve but
[1:57:55.440 --> 1:57:59.520]  this year I couldn't you know the last little busy so that just shows how things
[1:57:59.520 --> 1:58:06.800]  are really picking up and how you really gonna have much bigger of like people
[1:58:06.800 --> 1:58:10.480]  paying attention this year so I'm sure Wilson Wilson I appreciate your call
[1:58:10.480 --> 1:58:13.840]  happy new year to you have a great new year fighting tyranny folks we have our
[1:58:13.840 --> 1:58:17.400]  own phone system they only have six phone lines of Genesis in Minnesota that
[1:58:17.400 --> 1:58:21.240]  we manually take calls off of we have a system that can take over a hundred calls
[1:58:21.240 --> 1:58:29.120]  and when we open the phone system up for 10 seconds we'll get 30 or 40 okay so
[1:58:29.120 --> 1:58:33.760]  yeah and we could do that years ago I mean I could take a thousand phone calls
[1:58:33.760 --> 1:58:37.800]  in a in an hour if I could physically get them on the air let's come back and
[1:58:37.800 --> 1:58:41.240]  take some more of those calls stay with us

[1:58:51.720 --> 1:58:56.480]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[1:58:56.480 --> 1:59:01.080]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[1:59:01.080 --> 1:59:05.360]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I've turned
[1:59:05.360 --> 1:59:10.200]  members influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[1:59:10.200 --> 1:59:15.520]  shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[1:59:15.520 --> 1:59:20.440]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal off-short
[1:59:20.440 --> 1:59:25.200]  cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[1:59:25.200 --> 1:59:29.240]  world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists they're asking for more
[1:59:29.240 --> 1:59:33.160]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to. Today seems
[1:59:33.160 --> 1:59:38.800]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the
[1:59:38.800 --> 1:59:44.840]  Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com we're

[1:59:51.440 --> 2:00:01.240]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[2:00:05.000 --> 2:00:13.040]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he.
[2:00:13.040 --> 2:00:20.320]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[2:00:20.320 --> 2:00:29.880]  Alex Jones. It is Thursday the seventh day of January 2010. It's hard to get used
[2:00:29.880 --> 2:00:35.160]  to saying that but I will soon by the time I get used to it'll be 2011. We're
[2:00:35.160 --> 2:00:40.520]  continuing with open phones and then a blitz of news coming up. Seth in Vegas.
[2:00:40.520 --> 2:00:48.000]  Seth you're on the air welcome. Hi Alex can you hear me? Yes sir. Yes sir I work
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:52.440]  at McCarran out in Las Vegas and I talk with 300 to over a thousand people a
[2:00:52.440 --> 2:00:57.320]  day traveling from all over the country and of course out of the country and I
[2:00:57.320 --> 2:01:01.120]  was just I was discussing the body scanners with the young lady that flew
[2:01:01.120 --> 2:01:04.520]  in from Philadelphia and she said that there were body scanning like everybody
[2:01:04.520 --> 2:01:08.240]  out there. I was just wondering if you had just if you talked with anybody coming
[2:01:08.240 --> 2:01:13.120]  through Philadelphia. Yes they want to break people's will because of the
[2:01:13.120 --> 2:01:17.040]  underwear bomber everywhere where they got the scanners and now they're trying to
[2:01:17.040 --> 2:01:21.600]  put them in 214 major airports. They're taking large portions of people and I've
[2:01:21.600 --> 2:01:26.000]  seen a video on the news and just getting everybody conditioned as fast as they
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:30.440]  can during the staged event during the fear to try to break our resolve. I mean
[2:01:30.440 --> 2:01:35.040]  the house passed a law against it and they barely beat it in the Senate so
[2:01:35.040 --> 2:01:39.800]  they're desperate to set the precedent right now. Yeah and I've noticed the huge
[2:01:39.800 --> 2:01:45.160]  media blitz now with security infractions all over now that there's this big
[2:01:45.160 --> 2:01:47.880]  security problem. You know what they're doing they're just building it up so they
[2:01:47.880 --> 2:01:53.120]  can put these scanners in. Sir they suddenly have army and marines with
[2:01:53.120 --> 2:01:59.080]  National Guard MPs from the Air Force Army everywhere. I see articles every
[2:01:59.080 --> 2:02:04.680]  week just randomly in Tennessee, Texas, everywhere just randomly searching people
[2:02:04.680 --> 2:02:09.320]  on highways. We're just being slowly quietly it's always just in local papers.
[2:02:09.320 --> 2:02:13.680]  Oh here's the army. They're getting us ready to fully implode the economy by
[2:02:13.680 --> 2:02:18.600]  design. It's a criminal government that's robbed us. They need a police
[2:02:18.600 --> 2:02:22.440]  state in place so they can get away with it and the cops and the military and
[2:02:22.440 --> 2:02:27.120]  everybody that are carrying this out. They never allow a national debate
[2:02:27.120 --> 2:02:30.800]  because the people would say no. They're just quietly conditioning the local
[2:02:30.800 --> 2:02:35.480]  governments and the police right now Seth so they can have the full roll out of
[2:02:35.480 --> 2:02:38.880]  this. I appreciate your call. Jim in Missouri or is that Montana? You're on
[2:02:38.880 --> 2:02:44.480]  the air. Go ahead. Hey Alex, Jim, St. Louis. I just want to give you a couple
[2:02:44.480 --> 2:02:49.200]  updates. Apparently there was a disgruntled worker here in St. Louis.
[2:02:49.200 --> 2:02:56.480]  CNN's putting out that three apparently are dead, eight are wounded. Go figure.
[2:02:56.480 --> 2:03:02.120]  I just got done shoveling my driveway. Go figure. Global warming. Are we allowed
[2:03:02.120 --> 2:03:07.360]  to say that? I don't know yet. Well I'll tell you this. I'll tell you this Jim. I
[2:03:07.360 --> 2:03:11.560]  mean record cold temperatures in the last century all over the planet, people
[2:03:11.560 --> 2:03:18.200]  dying in India, the biggest snow falling over 100 years in DC and the last nine
[2:03:18.200 --> 2:03:21.520]  years the earth's been cooling according to all the temperature data. But they
[2:03:21.520 --> 2:03:24.760]  say you're not allowed to question. Man may global warming is going to kill us
[2:03:24.760 --> 2:03:30.960]  all. Get this Tel Aviv now. Just like you said, they are now implementing instead
[2:03:30.960 --> 2:03:39.480]  of just body scanners are doing. Passport, smart cards, thumbprint and a face
[2:03:39.480 --> 2:03:45.200]  scan. And then we're told oh we need to bring Israeli style here. We're five
[2:03:45.200 --> 2:03:48.520]  different times you get interrogated and they're going to do that with the
[2:03:48.520 --> 2:03:53.440]  Israelis advising. But on top of it all the other body scanning and then Israel's
[2:03:53.440 --> 2:03:58.720]  adopting all of our stuff. Hey, I just want to let you know I support you. I got
[2:03:58.720 --> 2:04:03.480]  your membership. I bought a couple shirts. Thank you. Let you know that you're
[2:04:03.480 --> 2:04:09.520]  on it and the truth will always prevail. But Jim, God bless you. We are on the
[2:04:09.520 --> 2:04:13.720]  March. The Empire is on the run and it is. Thanks to people like you, Jim. We're
[2:04:13.720 --> 2:04:18.200]  able to operate the prison planet dot TV memberships 15 cents a day, 595 a month
[2:04:18.200 --> 2:04:20.920]  or get it even cheaper when you get a year. You get five and a half months

[2:04:31.280 --> 2:04:34.440]  couldn't do what we're doing without you. We're going to go to break. I'm going to
[2:04:34.440 --> 2:04:42.120]  try to go calls even faster. Michael, Joe, Ronnie and others 1-800-259-9231.
[2:04:42.120 --> 2:04:48.600]  The government is a cult, a criminal enterprise taking over our society. The
[2:04:48.600 --> 2:04:53.080]  people are standing up and saying no. Every active resistance you carry out
[2:04:53.080 --> 2:04:58.000]  brings the New World Order one inch closer to destruction. We'll be right
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:05:02.720]  back after this quick break. Tonna news coming up as well. Hello, this is Alex
[2:05:02.720 --> 2:05:06.720]  Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and they give
[2:05:06.720 --> 2:05:10.760]  you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would
[2:05:10.760 --> 2:05:14.720]  be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved
[2:05:14.720 --> 2:05:19.600]  ones. Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now
[2:05:19.600 --> 2:05:23.720]  or after the battle starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper
[2:05:23.720 --> 2:05:27.760]  identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's
[2:05:27.760 --> 2:05:31.600]  a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the Gathering Center and
[2:05:31.600 --> 2:05:35.840]  be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:05:35.840 --> 2:05:40.760]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you
[2:05:40.760 --> 2:05:45.680]  need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want

[2:08:01.120 --> 2:08:06.520]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[2:08:06.520 --> 2:08:11.120]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[2:08:20.320 --> 2:08:26.440]  In the last three years we've seen mainstream national television tell the
[2:08:26.440 --> 2:08:32.960]  public that lithium in the water to brain damage you is good and that if it
[2:08:32.960 --> 2:08:40.040]  makes one person not commit suicide we need to do it. We've seen federally
[2:08:40.040 --> 2:08:44.760]  financed studies come out and say that mercury is good for your children's
[2:08:44.760 --> 2:08:49.840]  brains. And of course literally tens of thousands of studies in the last hundred
[2:08:49.840 --> 2:08:54.000]  years show it's one of the most deadly heavy metals and just literally burns
[2:08:54.000 --> 2:08:58.320]  through the brain. It doesn't just kill a few brain cells and then deposit out. It
[2:08:58.320 --> 2:09:03.260]  keeps burning in the electron microscope videos that we've posted for major
[2:09:03.260 --> 2:09:07.480]  universities. It's the only heavy metal that causes electrochemical explosions
[2:09:07.480 --> 2:09:13.200]  in the brains. Kind of similar to the movie Alien when the acid the blood of
[2:09:13.200 --> 2:09:18.880]  the alien burns through four or five levels of the ship. That's what mercury
[2:09:18.880 --> 2:09:24.400]  does. But they say it's nutritious and good. They say it's wonderful for you.
[2:09:24.400 --> 2:09:31.040]  They have TV newscasts where they now say things like oh we want poison in the
[2:09:31.040 --> 2:09:35.680]  toys from China. It's good for our economy. China just had another big
[2:09:35.680 --> 2:09:42.080]  melamine scare. More people getting sick. Melamine was found in 90% of baby
[2:09:42.080 --> 2:09:48.080]  formula in the U.S. from U.S. factories and instead of them taking the
[2:09:48.080 --> 2:09:52.920]  melamine out they just said melamine is no longer bad for you. Mercury is no
[2:09:52.920 --> 2:09:58.800]  longer bad. Melamine is no longer bad. Lead is no longer bad. Jumping off a
[2:09:58.800 --> 2:10:04.360]  cliff I guess is no longer bad according to the government. And now I have Fox
[2:10:04.360 --> 2:10:09.840]  News. This is coming up after calls in my stack. Give me a close shot for
[2:10:09.840 --> 2:10:15.640]  PrismPlanet.tv viewers. Can cell phones cure Alzheimer's? And it says cell phones
[2:10:15.640 --> 2:10:21.280]  are good for your brain. Yes it's radiating your brain but it's good for
[2:10:21.280 --> 2:10:28.320]  you. Cell phones are good. Body scanners are good. Mercury is good for your brain.
[2:10:28.320 --> 2:10:32.160]  Pretty soon they'll say shooting yourself in the head with a 12-gauge shotgun is
[2:10:32.160 --> 2:10:36.280]  good for you. Folks if they start saying that don't try it it will kill you. They
[2:10:36.280 --> 2:10:42.200]  are practicing insanity. Practicing lying to get you conditioned to accept
[2:10:42.200 --> 2:10:47.920]  it. That's how they claim they killed Khalid Sheikh Mohammed more than ten
[2:10:47.920 --> 2:10:52.640]  times before they captured him. Then they held him for seven years. He confessed
[2:10:52.640 --> 2:10:56.560]  to bombing buildings that weren't built for close to four years after he was
[2:10:56.560 --> 2:11:02.200]  arrested. That's like confessing to singing the Titanic before he was born.
[2:11:02.200 --> 2:11:07.240]  But the media still says never retracted. He was killed all those times and he was
[2:11:07.240 --> 2:11:12.360]  captured and he's confessed to bombing buildings that didn't exist. And they did
[2:11:12.360 --> 2:11:16.680]  this over and over again with chemical Ali and all of them to just set the
[2:11:16.680 --> 2:11:24.880]  precedent of doing whatever they want. Because they know the general public is
[2:11:24.880 --> 2:11:30.200]  passively watching TV, passively reading the newspaper headlines, and just hear a
[2:11:30.200 --> 2:11:34.520]  guy try to blow up a plane again. Oh this guy confessed. Oh they're gonna put him
[2:11:34.520 --> 2:11:41.400]  on trial Khalid Sheikh Mohammed after seven years of incarceration and
[2:11:41.400 --> 2:11:47.240]  admitted torture. Folks if they grabbed me for a year and then rolled me out on
[2:11:47.240 --> 2:11:52.680]  TV saying I committed murders or bombings and they admit I was tortured or
[2:11:52.680 --> 2:11:57.880]  you were tortured it's not admissible. All Americans knew in the war with North
[2:11:57.880 --> 2:12:05.920]  Korea hundreds and hundreds of pilots got shot down and after a couple years of
[2:12:05.920 --> 2:12:11.120]  captivity the North Koreans would release on worldwide television through
[2:12:11.120 --> 2:12:15.720]  the Soviets, through the Chinese and Russians, film footage of our airmen
[2:12:15.720 --> 2:12:20.480]  saying I am a war criminal. I was told to target women and children. I was told to
[2:12:20.480 --> 2:12:26.840]  target civilian bases which wasn't true in the Korean War. And they would you
[2:12:26.840 --> 2:12:30.200]  know the famous cases of blinking Morse code that's not just a Hollywood movie.
[2:12:30.200 --> 2:12:35.600]  They blinked Morse code saying torture, torture, torture, torture, torture,
[2:12:35.600 --> 2:12:40.240]  torture, torture. Same thing in Vietnam. They'd roll our troops out after years of
[2:12:40.240 --> 2:12:46.160]  torture. They would confess to anything. Americans knew a country that tortures you
[2:12:46.160 --> 2:12:53.520]  don't believe anyone they bring up on trial. What happened to us? How did we
[2:12:53.520 --> 2:12:58.800]  turn into demons? Well we didn't turn into demons. The government said we like
[2:12:58.800 --> 2:13:02.080]  torture, said we like torture of children in front of their parents, try to
[2:13:02.080 --> 2:13:07.320]  sell us on it. So that's coming up with a bunch of other news but who's up next
[2:13:07.320 --> 2:13:13.040]  here? Ronnie in Texas or already go to him? That's what I thought. Okay Mike in
[2:13:13.040 --> 2:13:19.720]  Chicago, Mike you're on the air. Me? Yes sir. Hey you know I'm listening to you on
[2:13:19.720 --> 2:13:23.800]  the body scanner stuff and one of the things that scares me every time I
[2:13:23.800 --> 2:13:29.640]  see the report on the news is that they keep mentioning that he paid for his
[2:13:29.640 --> 2:13:34.920]  ticket with cash. Yeah cash is evil and they had body scanners there but he
[2:13:34.920 --> 2:13:38.880]  wasn't put through him. He was led on to the blame. Right and so you know I mean
[2:13:38.880 --> 2:13:43.560]  I think the body scanners I don't know you know sometimes I wonder what's the
[2:13:43.560 --> 2:13:46.920]  distraction not that they're a distraction not that they're inconsequential
[2:13:46.920 --> 2:13:51.200]  but are they a distraction from the real ultimate goal which is to basically
[2:13:51.200 --> 2:13:57.360]  eliminate cash? Well sir they've got ads in newspapers I've seen for more than a
[2:13:57.360 --> 2:14:02.520]  decade in TV ads and magazine ads saying cash is dirty, cash is bad during the
[2:14:02.520 --> 2:14:07.280]  swine flu the feds did that. They want everything digital to destroy underground
[2:14:07.280 --> 2:14:11.880]  economies and further bankrupt people and I agree with you but body scanners
[2:14:11.880 --> 2:14:15.360]  aren't a distraction from the health care bill because they've already pretty
[2:14:15.360 --> 2:14:20.600]  much got that as a done deal. Though this is a big deal getting us to submit to
[2:14:20.600 --> 2:14:24.360]  body scanning. I don't disagree, I don't disagree but and that's what I mean you
[2:14:24.360 --> 2:14:28.240]  know I think that's one of the steps in taking away your cash later. Would you I
[2:14:28.240 --> 2:14:31.600]  mean would you like the body scanner to go away? Well we've solved the problem
[2:14:31.600 --> 2:14:36.400]  everybody's using cash. You know I don't necessarily mean that this isn't
[2:14:36.400 --> 2:14:42.800]  consequential. Again is it just is it just one step in the ultimate goal of I
[2:14:42.800 --> 2:14:46.760]  mean the cashless society scares me more than anything in terms of control. I
[2:14:46.760 --> 2:14:51.840]  mean second only maybe to health care. And notice how all the businesses are
[2:14:51.840 --> 2:14:55.360]  being pressured and all the government employees and corporate employees to
[2:14:55.360 --> 2:14:59.880]  take automatic transfer to do automatic payments to only use a card. I agree with
[2:14:59.880 --> 2:15:03.640]  you Michael. Thanks for the call. I got confused by Michael in Illinois and
[2:15:03.640 --> 2:15:07.920]  Michael in Chicago. Michael in Chicago is coming up. Joe in Texas you're on the
[2:15:07.920 --> 2:15:13.600]  air go ahead. Alex first off in the words of Native American Indians thank
[2:15:13.600 --> 2:15:19.440]  you for being a true human being. And my second was like I didn't I thought I
[2:15:19.440 --> 2:15:23.400]  was seeing things yesterday morning between 8 and 9. I had the volume down
[2:15:23.400 --> 2:15:30.400]  and watching Fox and they showed that from what I saw it on the body scan. They
[2:15:30.400 --> 2:15:36.720]  showed it looked to me like the it's not it's not just the booth you go into but
[2:15:36.720 --> 2:15:41.880]  they got it looked to me like a scanner that you can see the whole the whole
[2:15:41.880 --> 2:15:49.200]  body basically. Sir without yes yes they have they phase it in. Five airports
[2:15:49.200 --> 2:15:55.240]  last time I read it in CBS have passive body scanners. First under your ticket
[2:15:55.240 --> 2:16:00.880]  they put you through a body scanner that records a 360 biometric scan. Then they've
[2:16:00.880 --> 2:16:05.080]  got passive scanners in the airports that once you've been scanned from then
[2:16:05.080 --> 2:16:10.240]  on out it's in a database that know your entire body. So they look through your
[2:16:10.240 --> 2:16:15.280]  clothes with a with what they call a passive scanner and scan you. They also
[2:16:15.280 --> 2:16:22.040]  five airports in the same reports I saw years ago they have brain scanners that
[2:16:22.040 --> 2:16:29.600]  quote pick up anger brain waves that show agitation all quackery all fraud not real
[2:16:29.600 --> 2:16:33.560]  science hundreds of thousands of people conservatively the government's now
[2:16:33.560 --> 2:16:36.800]  admitted this that's why they don't use lie detectors anymore in court or in
[2:16:36.800 --> 2:16:41.400]  court proceedings. They would just lie and say a lie detector showed you were
[2:16:41.400 --> 2:16:44.160]  guilty even when you said you weren't later would come out you were innocent
[2:16:44.160 --> 2:16:51.320]  that's quackery. So they just moved on to new baloney yes we've written articles
[2:16:51.320 --> 2:16:55.800]  at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com on body scanners. Steve Watson had one up
[2:16:55.800 --> 2:17:00.840]  yesterday that had the images from the news of the passive scanners. Once they
[2:17:00.840 --> 2:17:06.160]  scan you in the airport it's a sign to your name and major cities have already
[2:17:06.160 --> 2:17:12.520]  put body scanners in. Do you understand this is a sir this is a total grid. Yes
[2:17:12.520 --> 2:17:17.680]  sir and the the other thing regarding the home schooling I know Alex you have
[2:17:17.680 --> 2:17:23.640]  it documented that home schoolers in other words like if they're doing third
[2:17:23.640 --> 2:17:28.280]  grade I have two nieces that are home schooled and if they're third grade
[2:17:28.280 --> 2:17:38.000]  they're doing fifth grade education level schoolwork and but and also excellent
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:42.320]  excellent consulting you do with Jesse I saw the mind control and it's very very
[2:17:42.320 --> 2:17:47.400]  scary and I see things advancing just so fast Alex but thank you for Prison
[2:17:47.400 --> 2:17:52.120]  Planet and Infowars brother. Thank you I appreciate your call let's jam in one
[2:17:52.120 --> 2:17:58.080]  more here quickly let's talk to Ronnie in Texas Ronnie you're on the air. Thank
[2:17:58.080 --> 2:18:02.680]  you sir celebrate the year 2010 is the first year of the two doctors Paul in
[2:18:02.680 --> 2:18:07.040]  the U.S. legislature with the exploding campaign in the Congress soon to be you
[2:18:07.040 --> 2:18:12.240]  at senator from Kentucky ran to paul2010.com and I'm still by the way
[2:18:12.240 --> 2:18:15.840]  under only temporary cancellation of my first amendment right for freedom to
[2:18:15.840 --> 2:18:20.360]  express political ideas. That's right I did see that in the paper you've been
[2:18:20.360 --> 2:18:25.140]  banned from wearing any any messages on your shirt at Travis County
[2:18:25.140 --> 2:18:30.320]  Commissioner's Court. And they will let me show my sign at all but it's
[2:18:30.320 --> 2:18:34.200]  basically you know the Ron Paul sign or anything. Everyone should show up during
[2:18:34.200 --> 2:18:39.720]  citizens communications next week what is it Monday or Tuesdays. It's Tuesday at
[2:18:39.720 --> 2:18:44.160]  nine o'clock. Yeah same as it was 10 years ago and I used to have time to go
[2:18:44.160 --> 2:18:48.080]  down there. Everybody should be down there for citizens communications with
[2:18:48.080 --> 2:18:52.560]  their own Ron Paul shirts or their own Infowars.com shirts. Imagine them saying
[2:18:52.560 --> 2:18:56.800]  no one's allowed and you should also go videotape other people that will have
[2:18:56.800 --> 2:19:01.760]  Budweiser or Ford or Chevy or Buckmaster on their shirt and sue them for
[2:19:01.760 --> 2:19:05.720]  discrimination. Well the biggest thing is the city council I mean at least I can
[2:19:05.720 --> 2:19:08.400]  get into the Travis County Commissioner's Court but the city council I'm
[2:19:08.400 --> 2:19:13.560]  still one in every four meetings. That's my suspension they choose to allow me to
[2:19:13.560 --> 2:19:17.760]  have my first amendment right 25% of the time at best if I happen to get in that's
[2:19:17.760 --> 2:19:21.840]  how they phase it in soon it'll be nothing I appreciate your call. Yeah
[2:19:21.840 --> 2:19:25.640]  there's a caller there I mean it all over the country they're just getting
[2:19:25.640 --> 2:19:29.760]  rid of citizens communications they're shutting down access TV they're moving
[2:19:29.760 --> 2:19:34.040]  in because if you're a criminal in government and you've got police that
[2:19:34.040 --> 2:19:38.360]  will do whatever you're they're told you've got the people by the shorthairs.
[2:19:38.360 --> 2:19:43.320]  We're gonna come back go to Mike in Chicago Mark in California Mike and
[2:19:43.320 --> 2:19:47.760]  go burp on air trying to eat lunch and three minutes during these breaks not
[2:19:47.760 --> 2:19:56.400]  too good and excuse me oh and Mike in California Bill in Connecticut and and

[2:21:10.800 --> 2:21:15.280]  agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I've
[2:21:15.280 --> 2:21:19.800]  turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[2:21:19.800 --> 2:21:24.600]  are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[2:21:24.600 --> 2:21:28.960]  citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[2:21:28.960 --> 2:21:34.240]  nation. The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[2:21:34.240 --> 2:21:37.880]  its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're
[2:21:37.880 --> 2:21:41.720]  arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do
[2:21:41.720 --> 2:21:45.520]  we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[2:21:45.520 --> 2:21:51.520]  Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Full of the
[2:21:51.520 --> 2:21:57.280]  Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super
[2:21:57.280 --> 2:22:03.880]  high quality at prisonplanet.tv. On the average Americans work between 45 to 50
[2:22:03.880 --> 2:22:07.200]  years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden
[2:22:07.200 --> 2:22:12.240]  years. Unfortunately with taxation the rising cost of food, energy, housing and
[2:22:12.240 --> 2:22:16.340]  medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line. Is this a
[2:22:16.340 --> 2:22:19.960]  flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve note
[2:22:19.960 --> 2:22:24.320]  forcing us into perpetual debt ensuring inflation and higher taxes? These
[2:22:24.320 --> 2:22:27.800]  questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book The
[2:22:27.800 --> 2:22:31.440]  Creature from Jekyll Island. Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every
[2:22:31.440 --> 2:22:35.760]  American needs to know about central bank power. A gripping adventure into the

[2:24:09.120 --> 2:24:17.760]  It's sundown on the Union. We don't stop the globalist. We are raising the alarm
[2:24:17.760 --> 2:24:20.600]  worldwide.
[2:24:20.600 --> 2:24:36.080]  I have a friend of mine who lives in Riyadh Saudi Arabia, the capital city of
[2:24:36.080 --> 2:24:42.440]  Saudi Arabia. His father works for one of the princes and I contacted him on
[2:24:42.440 --> 2:24:45.600]  Christmas to wish him a merry Christmas. He's Muslim but whatever I'm a
[2:24:45.600 --> 2:24:50.800]  Christian so you know it just is what it is. He told me that there were F-16s
[2:24:50.800 --> 2:24:56.200]  making strikes against Yemen for three to four days before Christmas. I don't
[2:24:56.200 --> 2:24:59.360]  know if you know anybody that can confirm that on the inside. Yes, I can
[2:24:59.360 --> 2:25:05.640]  confirm it. I can confirm it. 2,000 US special forces according to the New York
[2:25:05.640 --> 2:25:11.400]  Times, the day before Christmas, have been in the country, the CIA, the British
[2:25:11.400 --> 2:25:15.560]  have been massing, there have been aircraft strikes and drone strikes going
[2:25:15.560 --> 2:25:22.280]  on for at least two years, accelerating in the month before the Christmas Day
[2:25:22.280 --> 2:25:25.720]  attack. Then they claim though that they're now there and attacking because
[2:25:25.720 --> 2:25:30.600]  of Christmas Day. Just like they order the body scanners the year before they
[2:25:30.600 --> 2:25:35.360]  start going in in December and January and they tell us, oh we're putting these
[2:25:35.360 --> 2:25:41.280]  in because of the underwear bomber. It is a little odd that they're already making
[2:25:41.280 --> 2:25:45.880]  he said there were F-16s flying over the city of Riyadh and on their way to
[2:25:45.880 --> 2:25:49.920]  Yemen for three to four days before Christmas and then all of a sudden we
[2:25:49.920 --> 2:25:53.960]  have a guy who lights his underwear on fire that justifies everything that we
[2:25:53.960 --> 2:25:58.000]  do from there forward. And he gets walked on the plane past the body
[2:25:58.000 --> 2:26:01.560]  scanners and somebody's video tapping on the plane and they take them off in
[2:26:01.560 --> 2:26:05.320]  customs and somebody reportedly has a bomb and the FBI lies about it now
[2:26:05.320 --> 2:26:11.000]  admits they lie but won't say why. Look at all the timing of this. God bless you
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:15.240]  Alex. Take care of yourself. I appreciate your call Mike. Yes, they admit air strikes
[2:26:15.240 --> 2:26:21.320]  from air from piloted aircraft. Now you have to remember though they admit U.S.
[2:26:21.320 --> 2:26:25.920]  drones are attacking and U.S. aircraft. They don't specify they quote the CIA and
[2:26:25.920 --> 2:26:31.760]  the State Department in the New York Times. December 24th, BBC December 24th,
[2:26:31.760 --> 2:26:37.080]  Associated Press December 24th. I covered those articles last week. I came on the
[2:26:37.080 --> 2:26:42.280]  air Sunday three days after two and a half days after the underwear attack that
[2:26:42.280 --> 2:26:46.720]  has everyone so scared according to the media and we covered those. But you have
[2:26:46.720 --> 2:26:51.320]  to remember Saudi Arabia has bought hundreds and hundreds of F-16s. I mean
[2:26:51.320 --> 2:26:56.720]  every few years there's some 150 planes, 200 planes ordered. I mean you've all
[2:26:56.720 --> 2:27:02.960]  seen that in the news. So those maybe Saudi Arabian F-16s because it is
[2:27:02.960 --> 2:27:09.760]  confirmed that Saudi Arabian F-16s and F-15s have been bombing over the last
[2:27:09.760 --> 2:27:16.880]  year in northern Yemen. So that's on record. Let's go ahead and talk to Mark
[2:27:16.880 --> 2:27:23.440]  in California. Mark you're on the air. Hey Alex, how you doing? Good sir. I just want
[2:27:23.440 --> 2:27:28.280]  to let you know and everyone else know out there that Carl Rove is coming to
[2:27:28.280 --> 2:27:33.160]  the University of California Santa Barbara on February 25th and that we
[2:27:33.160 --> 2:27:38.000]  should really get together some kind of... And he's been praising Obama for
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:42.320]  continuing rendition, secret arrest, continuing torture, continuing the
[2:27:42.320 --> 2:27:47.280]  Patriot Act. For all these stupid Obama lovers, look at Carl Rove the demon
[2:27:47.280 --> 2:27:53.000]  loving your leader Obama. Yes, everyone should protest this criminal and he is a
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:57.040]  criminal. He called for torture. He engaged in all sorts of criminal acts. He
[2:27:57.040 --> 2:28:01.120]  said the president was above the law. He started the signing statements above the
[2:28:01.120 --> 2:28:08.920]  law. Again, when is Carl Rove sliming in the town? February 25th and it's going to
[2:28:08.920 --> 2:28:13.600]  be at Campbell Hall in the University of California Santa Barbara. Okay, Mike,
[2:28:13.600 --> 2:28:18.640]  anything else? No, that's it man. Just one more thing actually. They call him a
[2:28:18.640 --> 2:28:23.080]  conservative in the newspaper here, the campus newspaper and I just laugh at
[2:28:23.080 --> 2:28:27.600]  that. You know, he's a murderer, a fascist and he needs to be held accountable
[2:28:27.600 --> 2:28:31.640]  for his war crimes. Well, he's more than that. He bankrupted our country. I mean,
[2:28:31.640 --> 2:28:35.520]  he was one of the chiefs, little minions. But again, mainline conservatives, they
[2:28:35.520 --> 2:28:39.340]  love the end of America. They just want their party to be in. The average
[2:28:39.340 --> 2:28:43.560]  blue-haired Republican is a piece of garbage and there's a lot of old folks
[2:28:43.560 --> 2:28:46.360]  and young people that are great conservatives, but they understand the
[2:28:46.360 --> 2:28:52.480]  Republican Party is bad. Let's go ahead and talk to Bill and Connecticut. Bill,
[2:28:52.480 --> 2:28:56.880]  you're on the air. Hey, Alex, how you doing? Good. Happy
[2:28:56.880 --> 2:29:03.240]  day or two. Hey, I was just sitting here reading this thing on MSNBC where they
[2:29:03.240 --> 2:29:08.480]  have this Israel launches biometric airline security system and I thought
[2:29:08.480 --> 2:29:11.920]  it was interesting that, you know, everybody that's on here making comments
[2:29:11.920 --> 2:29:15.240]  like all praising these guys about how great they are, et cetera, et cetera. But
[2:29:15.240 --> 2:29:18.560]  I just have a question for you because I know you know the answer. What was the
[2:29:18.560 --> 2:29:23.360]  name of the Israeli security company that had security of all of the
[2:29:23.360 --> 2:29:29.600]  airports in the United States prior to 9-11? They had control of a lot of them.
[2:29:29.600 --> 2:29:33.400]  There were several companies and it's kind of like asking me on my cousin's
[2:29:33.400 --> 2:29:38.120]  name. I'd normally know it, but I don't know it. Do you know the name? I wish I
[2:29:38.120 --> 2:29:42.600]  did. I don't. But I just think it's interesting because I'm looking at
[2:29:42.600 --> 2:29:46.840]  this thing here. One of the companies they mentioned here is Fortress GB in
[2:29:46.840 --> 2:29:52.560]  England. Stay there. Stay there. Stay there. We'll come back to you. We're on the
[2:29:52.560 --> 2:30:01.360]  March. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. This is
[2:30:01.360 --> 2:30:04.720]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[2:30:04.720 --> 2:30:09.000]  generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple
[2:30:09.000 --> 2:30:13.120]  your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much
[2:30:13.120 --> 2:30:17.240]  power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government
[2:30:17.240 --> 2:30:21.600]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number
[2:30:21.600 --> 2:30:25.640]  three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[2:30:25.640 --> 2:30:30.280]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four,
[2:30:30.280 --> 2:30:34.360]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of
[2:30:34.360 --> 2:30:37.720]  families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a
[2:30:37.720 --> 2:30:42.040]  solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks
[2:30:42.040 --> 2:30:44.840]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from
[2:30:44.840 --> 2:30:50.840]  Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[2:31:03.080 --> 2:31:06.680]  some important questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a
[2:31:06.680 --> 2:31:11.360]  rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I can
[2:31:11.360 --> 2:31:15.840]  get. In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your
[2:31:15.840 --> 2:31:20.200]  only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the
[2:31:20.200 --> 2:31:23.520]  battle starts. When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper
[2:31:23.520 --> 2:31:27.280]  identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If
[2:31:27.280 --> 2:31:30.880]  there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering
[2:31:30.880 --> 2:31:35.240]  center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food
[2:31:35.240 --> 2:31:40.240]  supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much
[2:31:40.240 --> 2:31:44.800]  will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.

[2:33:10.200 --> 2:33:15.640]  Alright, I'm gonna take the next five calls in line. Then I'm gonna blitz through
[2:33:15.640 --> 2:33:19.720]  a bunch of important news that continue with calls. I'm gonna have Aaron Dykes in
[2:33:19.720 --> 2:33:27.840]  the studio with me some on eugenics and some video clips of these eugenicists
[2:33:27.840 --> 2:33:33.840]  openly calling for the mass extermination of society. Actual video of
[2:33:33.840 --> 2:33:44.400]  George Bernard Shaw talking about this and others. So that is coming up and the
[2:33:44.400 --> 2:33:56.960]  caller was just now bringing up Israeli security firms. My issue with this is
[2:33:56.960 --> 2:34:04.520]  we're going back to him in a moment. My issue with this is that Israel's been
[2:34:04.520 --> 2:34:09.160]  caught spying on the United States. Israel has been caught over and over and
[2:34:09.160 --> 2:34:13.720]  over again taking sensitive military technology, guidance systems, aircraft
[2:34:13.720 --> 2:34:20.160]  systems, missile systems, armor systems and giving it to the Communist
[2:34:20.160 --> 2:34:24.400]  Chinese and Russians. In fact, the other day I was gonna cover this some, did some
[2:34:24.400 --> 2:34:28.040]  research, well I did some re-research, went and pulled up stuff I already knew
[2:34:28.040 --> 2:34:33.560]  was there to cover it on the radio show and they never got to it. So I want my
[2:34:33.560 --> 2:34:46.200]  crew right now to Google this online in front of everyone. Israel sold US
[2:34:46.200 --> 2:34:53.360]  technology to China. You type that in, you get literally hundreds and hundreds
[2:34:53.360 --> 2:34:59.560]  and hundreds of mainstream CBS, ABC, CNN or Israel has been caught selling
[2:34:59.560 --> 2:35:06.040]  everything under the sun, AWACS, radars, computers, our government sells them
[2:35:06.040 --> 2:35:13.400]  more advanced jets than we've got and then they give it to China and then oh
[2:35:13.400 --> 2:35:17.520]  well you can't talk about the wonderful little ally Israel. Israel is a criminal
[2:35:17.520 --> 2:35:22.360]  operation. So is the United States, so is England, so is China. What do the Founding
[2:35:22.360 --> 2:35:28.080]  Fathers teach us? 99% of the time governments are criminal but Israel
[2:35:28.080 --> 2:35:34.160]  makes itself look good up against Iran and other tyrannies like Saudi Arabia.
[2:35:34.160 --> 2:35:39.040]  Well yeah, they're bad too. See, that's what's so illogical about this. The
[2:35:39.040 --> 2:35:49.320]  government says give all your rights up or terrorists are gonna get you. Israel
[2:35:49.320 --> 2:35:54.800]  secretly sells American nuclear weapons to China. US arms sales to Israel end up
[2:35:54.800 --> 2:36:01.520]  in China. US anger at Israeli weapons sale, BBC, Harats, that's out of Israel, I
[2:36:01.520 --> 2:36:05.880]  guess they're anti-Semitic, selling arms to China or not. Harats, and then you
[2:36:05.880 --> 2:36:10.560]  read the article, they admit it. New York Times, Israel sells arms to China, US
[2:36:10.560 --> 2:36:26.560]  says, how many hits did that get? 390,000. 390,000. I'm looking at that across the
[2:36:26.560 --> 2:36:33.360]  room, is that 390,000 and 390 million? Yeah, it's 390,000. 390,000 hits on
[2:36:33.360 --> 2:36:39.280]  Israel sells weapons to China and they sign agreements that they won't sell it
[2:36:39.280 --> 2:36:43.960]  and they do. Why is Israel running a lot of the NSA equipment? Why does Israel get
[2:36:43.960 --> 2:36:47.160]  to run things that our own government is interested with? Why do they get to guard
[2:36:47.160 --> 2:36:52.640]  US nuclear weapons? Why are they one of the biggest contractors training
[2:36:52.640 --> 2:36:56.280]  Homeland Security? That was in the Associated Press and Jerusalem Post two
[2:36:56.280 --> 2:37:00.720]  weeks ago. Why does Interpol get more immunity, that's Europe and the rest of
[2:37:00.720 --> 2:37:08.200]  the planet, in the US than our own police? It's a joke. The UN and others just give
[2:37:08.200 --> 2:37:12.440]  themselves all this immunity and we just fall down in front of them. So I'm
[2:37:12.440 --> 2:37:15.400]  going back to your calls in a moment, but on that subject I wanted to make that
[2:37:15.400 --> 2:37:18.680]  point. Let me now go ahead and tell you about a few of the sponsors that made
[2:37:18.680 --> 2:37:26.360]  today's radio show possible. One of them is MySolarBackup. Have you lost your
[2:37:26.360 --> 2:37:29.800]  power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on? If so, you

[2:37:38.120 --> 2:37:42.200]  power. Here's why. Plug and play, solar generators are now available from
[2:37:42.200 --> 2:37:45.120]  Solutions from Science, and my listeners have been getting these for over two
[2:37:45.120 --> 2:37:48.280]  years now, they love them. The portable power systems need no installation,
[2:37:48.280 --> 2:37:52.680]  supply household current, wherever and whenever you need it, producing
[2:37:52.680 --> 2:37:55.680]  electricity directly from the sun and storing it in a little battery system.
[2:37:55.680 --> 2:37:59.720]  Unlike gas generators or solar generators, runs quietly and emits no fumes.
[2:37:59.720 --> 2:38:02.760]  It's like having your own electrical power plant and it's perfect for your home
[2:38:02.760 --> 2:38:07.560]  or your campsite. You get a bunch of them and run your whole house. Whether it's
[2:38:07.560 --> 2:38:11.600]  hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, blackouts, you'll never have to suffer
[2:38:11.600 --> 2:38:15.000]  through painful power outages. Again, just go to MySolarBackup.com to
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:21.080]  request a free information package. Today, that's MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365.
[2:38:21.080 --> 2:38:29.120]  That's 877-327-0365. Also, I want to tell you about Diginet.net. They've got a
[2:38:29.120 --> 2:38:33.440]  lot of great little hidden video camera pins, hidden video camera sunglasses
[2:38:33.440 --> 2:38:37.760]  that have the little memory chip in the sunglasses. Great way because you know
[2:38:37.760 --> 2:38:41.960]  what the camera's shooting from where you turn your head. That's my favorite system.
[2:38:41.960 --> 2:38:45.720]  They're all available at Diginet.net. They are a huge supplier and retailer.
[2:38:45.720 --> 2:38:48.840]  They sell to the government. You name it. So you get an incredibly low price.
[2:38:48.840 --> 2:38:51.760]  You're going right to a big wholesaler and their patriots.
[2:38:51.760 --> 2:38:56.400]  Diginet.net. Diginet.net. I love the pen as well.
[2:38:56.400 --> 2:39:03.400]  That's Diginet.net or click on the banner at infowars.com. That's D-I-G-A-N-E-T.net.
[2:39:03.400 --> 2:39:08.400]  And their phone number is also on their website if you'd like to give them a call.
[2:39:08.400 --> 2:39:13.400]  Again, that's Diginet.net. Okay, let's go back to your calls.
[2:39:13.400 --> 2:39:15.400]  I'm going to get into all this news. I haven't even covered yet.
[2:39:15.400 --> 2:39:20.400]  Okay, sir, finish up. Call Burmese in here. He made fabled enemies.
[2:39:20.400 --> 2:39:26.400]  All, I mean, I'd say 30, 40% of the two-hour film is about the Israel connection.
[2:39:26.400 --> 2:39:29.400]  Israel, the U.S., Britain, they're all joined at the hip. It's all the same thing
[2:39:29.400 --> 2:39:34.400]  with these intelligence agencies. Jason, a caller called in, Bill in Connecticut, I believe,
[2:39:34.400 --> 2:39:40.400]  and he was asking me, there were several of them, and I don't want to get this wrong.
[2:39:40.400 --> 2:39:46.400]  My memory is failing me right now. There's the Israeli company that's even in mainstream news
[2:39:46.400 --> 2:39:50.400]  that runs 90-plus percent of all caller ID checks in the country.
[2:39:50.400 --> 2:39:52.400]  It's two of those. That's Amdox and Converse.
[2:39:52.400 --> 2:39:54.400]  Start over. They didn't have your mic on. Go ahead.
[2:39:54.400 --> 2:39:58.400]  Yeah, the two companies that handle basically all the telecommunications in the United States
[2:39:58.400 --> 2:40:00.400]  are Amdox and Converse.
[2:40:00.400 --> 2:40:05.400]  And I want to think that the establishment the guy was talking about is Otago Securities.
[2:40:05.400 --> 2:40:08.400]  They're the ones that had the lease for another, I believe, 8...
[2:40:08.400 --> 2:40:12.400]  No, no. Otago was the big instant message company that sold it and changed the name.
[2:40:12.400 --> 2:40:17.400]  And it was in the Jerusalem Post that, it's not a rumor, that they called their employees
[2:40:17.400 --> 2:40:22.400]  to get out of the building four hours before. And that was also in the AP.
[2:40:22.400 --> 2:40:26.400]  But again, the executives all talked about it publicly, showing they weren't involved.
[2:40:26.400 --> 2:40:28.400]  And I'm not saying there weren't elements of Israel involved.
[2:40:28.400 --> 2:40:31.400]  Somehow the point is, is I'm saying Israel didn't go it alone.
[2:40:31.400 --> 2:40:35.400]  It doesn't reduce guilt on anybody. It's saying it's a huge operation,
[2:40:35.400 --> 2:40:38.400]  just like LBJ was involved in USS Liberty, so was Israel.
[2:40:38.400 --> 2:40:39.400]  Absolutely.
[2:40:39.400 --> 2:40:42.400]  It's like if two guys rob a bank, they're both equally guilty.
[2:40:42.400 --> 2:40:45.400]  The VADL-controlled white supremacist groups get mad at us
[2:40:45.400 --> 2:40:49.400]  and want to make it only an anti-Semitic deal so it doesn't become a mainstream media item
[2:40:49.400 --> 2:40:51.400]  and become kosher and acceptable to talk about.
[2:40:51.400 --> 2:40:56.400]  No, but what's the one that had the majority of contracts over airport security?
[2:40:56.400 --> 2:41:00.400]  Now, I know that Marvin Bush's company and Jeb Bush had companies
[2:41:00.400 --> 2:41:03.400]  over the major airports the hijackers came from
[2:41:03.400 --> 2:41:07.400]  and the food service on the planes and the security on the towers.
[2:41:07.400 --> 2:41:09.400]  And that was SecuraCom that later turned into Stratocic.
[2:41:09.400 --> 2:41:11.400]  That's the Jeb Bush one.
[2:41:11.400 --> 2:41:17.400]  The only other company I can think of was Zim Shipping that also seemed to have foreign knowledge.
[2:41:17.400 --> 2:41:21.400]  The securities companies, I'm not sure. I know that through Amdox and Converse,
[2:41:21.400 --> 2:41:25.400]  this rogue network, because they picked up about 180 Israelis,
[2:41:25.400 --> 2:41:30.400]  had basically infiltrated every major intelligence operation we had
[2:41:30.400 --> 2:41:34.400]  from secret offices, the secret service, the CIA, the FBI.
[2:41:34.400 --> 2:41:36.400]  The list went on in that Fox report.
[2:41:36.400 --> 2:41:40.400]  And again, your film, Fabled Enemies, has the Fox News clips, the C-span,
[2:41:40.400 --> 2:41:43.400]  the congressional admissions. This is not our opinion.
[2:41:43.400 --> 2:41:45.400]  No, it's absolutely not our opinion.
[2:41:45.400 --> 2:41:49.400]  There's one piece of an international intelligence operation that continues to this day.
[2:41:49.400 --> 2:41:51.400]  If you look at Iran Contra, for example.
[2:41:51.400 --> 2:41:54.400]  You've got Israel. You've got the Brits. You've got the U.S.
[2:41:54.400 --> 2:41:57.400]  You've got Latin American countries. And you've got the Iranians.
[2:41:57.400 --> 2:42:00.400]  And Israel was used for plausible deniability.
[2:42:00.400 --> 2:42:04.400]  Israel would actually purchase the weapons so the United States didn't have to do that part.
[2:42:04.400 --> 2:42:08.400]  We would take those weapons, ship them down, and then pay Israel later.
[2:42:08.400 --> 2:42:12.400]  Just like what happened in the nine-year war with the Russians,
[2:42:12.400 --> 2:42:17.400]  the Israelis, the Turks, the British, the U.S., the Saudi Arabians all involved.
[2:42:17.400 --> 2:42:18.400]  Absolutely.
[2:42:18.400 --> 2:42:20.400]  That's how governments compartmentalize.
[2:42:20.400 --> 2:42:24.400]  We're not one intelligence agency that I've seen never runs at all themselves
[2:42:24.400 --> 2:42:27.400]  because they want to divide it up or only certain groups know certain things.
[2:42:27.400 --> 2:42:29.400]  Look at the Pakistani ISI.
[2:42:29.400 --> 2:42:32.400]  This was literally set up by British intelligence
[2:42:32.400 --> 2:42:37.400]  and then revamped by U.S. intelligence and covert operations in the late 70s and 80s.
[2:42:37.400 --> 2:42:41.400]  And then they're the ones funding the hijackers prior to 9-11.
[2:42:41.400 --> 2:42:43.400]  All right, good job. Thank you so much.
[2:42:43.400 --> 2:42:47.400]  Again, Bill, does that answer your question?
[2:42:47.400 --> 2:42:49.400]  Yeah, no, I just thought it was interesting.
[2:42:49.400 --> 2:42:52.400]  Like I said, this article that's here on MSNBC today,
[2:42:52.400 --> 2:42:56.400]  talking about Israel watches biometric airlines security system,
[2:42:56.400 --> 2:43:00.400]  it's like they turn around and take your passport, your fingerprint,
[2:43:00.400 --> 2:43:02.400]  and like with the other guy, there was another guy that called in earlier
[2:43:02.400 --> 2:43:05.400]  to say something about the whole biometric thing.
[2:43:05.400 --> 2:43:10.400]  But I mean, it's like, if people turn around and get ticked off at this whole body scan thing,
[2:43:10.400 --> 2:43:12.400]  which personally, I will never fly.
[2:43:12.400 --> 2:43:13.400]  I mean, that's it.
[2:43:13.400 --> 2:43:14.400]  I just said to her, you know what?
[2:43:14.400 --> 2:43:16.400]  If that's the way it's going to be because it's already humiliating enough
[2:43:16.400 --> 2:43:19.400]  that you got to go in there, you're not even a bad guy.
[2:43:19.400 --> 2:43:22.400]  And they're, you know, they're frisking you, checking you out, this, that, the other thing.
[2:43:22.400 --> 2:43:24.400]  It's like, you know, forget about it.
[2:43:24.400 --> 2:43:25.400]  Why fly?
[2:43:25.400 --> 2:43:28.400]  But now it's like, here, they sit there and say that they don't want to have this,
[2:43:28.400 --> 2:43:30.400]  and they'll say, oh, well, let's go to this company.
[2:43:30.400 --> 2:43:33.400]  And then next thing you know, this company's got the contract.
[2:43:33.400 --> 2:43:37.400]  And then you've got Chertoff, who's an admitted Israeli double agent,
[2:43:37.400 --> 2:43:40.400]  his father and mother were founders of the Mossad.
[2:43:40.400 --> 2:43:42.400]  And he's making all this money.
[2:43:42.400 --> 2:43:44.400]  We're really being taken advantage of, and it's wrong.
[2:43:44.400 --> 2:43:46.400]  I appreciate your call.
[2:43:46.400 --> 2:43:52.400]  Israel tests new technology that could reduce airport security checks and make flights safer.
[2:43:52.400 --> 2:43:56.400]  And so what Israel's saying is they haven't had an incident over a decade.
[2:43:56.400 --> 2:44:01.400]  In 2002, a guy forgot to check a gun.
[2:44:01.400 --> 2:44:03.400]  Somebody was allowed to fly, but he forgot to check it.
[2:44:03.400 --> 2:44:05.400]  And then he later reported himself.
[2:44:05.400 --> 2:44:08.400]  They never have any instances because they do profile.
[2:44:08.400 --> 2:44:12.400]  And they do have some real Arab terrorists over there that do want to get on planes.
[2:44:12.400 --> 2:44:14.400]  I mean, some of that is real.
[2:44:14.400 --> 2:44:20.400]  And Israel hasn't had an incident in over a decade other than the 2002 gun incident where it was an accident.
[2:44:20.400 --> 2:44:25.400]  I mean, Jimmy Jones and the Cowboys twice brought guns on planes accidentally, forgetting,
[2:44:25.400 --> 2:44:28.400]  I mean, anybody who's got a brain has a gun on their briefcase.
[2:44:28.400 --> 2:44:34.400]  And I've forgotten before and been at the airport and noticed a pocket knife and just trashed it.
[2:44:34.400 --> 2:44:38.400]  A little bitty pocket knife, a little bitty pioneer old timer.
[2:44:38.400 --> 2:44:39.400]  I got a couple of them.
[2:44:39.400 --> 2:44:42.400]  But the point is, is that all of that goes on.
[2:44:42.400 --> 2:44:47.400]  And so now Israel's saying, hey, we're going to have biometric scanning and we're going to have biometric thumbprinting
[2:44:47.400 --> 2:44:49.400]  and we're going to have ID cards.
[2:44:49.400 --> 2:44:53.400]  And so the two are merging even worse to make something completely nightmarish.
[2:44:53.400 --> 2:44:55.400]  I have the AP right here reporting it.
[2:44:55.400 --> 2:44:59.400]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Mike in California.
[2:44:59.400 --> 2:45:01.400]  Mike, you're on the air.
[2:45:01.400 --> 2:45:04.400]  Hey, Alex, I had a couple of questions.
[2:45:04.400 --> 2:45:12.400]  Could you elaborate on what you know of some of the odd underground weapons you know that the elite may be working on,
[2:45:12.400 --> 2:45:16.400]  stuff like Project Blue Bean and another stuff that you probably know of,
[2:45:16.400 --> 2:45:19.400]  but I guess really talk about in another question is,
[2:45:19.400 --> 2:45:28.400]  how much will race play in how the elite envision the world they want to make or create in the future?
[2:45:28.400 --> 2:45:32.400]  Race plays a central role in divide and conquer,
[2:45:32.400 --> 2:45:37.400]  playing different groups off against each other with the government playing the part of the referee and judge
[2:45:37.400 --> 2:45:43.400]  that keeps everyone in line while their private foundations play everyone off against each other.
[2:45:43.400 --> 2:45:49.400]  Hitler disagreed with George Bernard Shaw, who they both admired each other.
[2:45:49.400 --> 2:45:55.400]  Bernard Shaw said, do IQ test and kill everyone with under a 90 IQ.
[2:45:55.400 --> 2:45:59.400]  And then over time, phase it up to 100 and make a super race,
[2:45:59.400 --> 2:46:02.400]  kill everyone who isn't a good socialist, break up the family.
[2:46:02.400 --> 2:46:07.400]  Hitler said, I agree with that, but we're only going to kill the sub races.
[2:46:07.400 --> 2:46:14.400]  And then later, we're going to start culling to only the ultra superior Arian.
[2:46:14.400 --> 2:46:19.400]  And they made a deal with the emperor of Japan who was obsessed with eugenics.
[2:46:19.400 --> 2:46:25.400]  That's mainline history. He said the Japanese will rule Asia as the master race.
[2:46:25.400 --> 2:46:28.400]  And the Germans with the British, the Germans actually believe the British,
[2:46:28.400 --> 2:46:35.400]  you really read Hitler and Goebbels writings, were the ultra supreme undefiled Arian.
[2:46:35.400 --> 2:46:38.400]  Because there'd been so many Eastern European and Arab.
[2:46:38.400 --> 2:46:40.400]  I mean, the Arabs even went into Western Europe.
[2:46:40.400 --> 2:46:47.400]  And so they believe that even the Germans were not as ultra pure as a certain strain of British.
[2:46:47.400 --> 2:46:51.400]  That's where the term British comes from as a tribe known as the British.
[2:46:51.400 --> 2:46:53.400]  And it's all complete hogwash.
[2:46:53.400 --> 2:46:59.400]  It's, again, you can't even single out the British as a distinct tribe.
[2:46:59.400 --> 2:47:03.400]  All those Germanic tribes were always killing and ranging and running around.
[2:47:03.400 --> 2:47:06.400]  But England is as Germanic as you can get.
[2:47:06.400 --> 2:47:13.400]  I mean, in the genetic studies that have been done, because they all came from the Gauls in France
[2:47:13.400 --> 2:47:22.400]  from Germania and from the Vikings in Northern Europe, they all came and waged war in England for thousands of years.
[2:47:22.400 --> 2:47:24.400]  Thousands of years before the Romans showed up.
[2:47:24.400 --> 2:47:30.400]  It was just continual slaughter going on as the Germanic tribes killed each other.
[2:47:30.400 --> 2:47:36.400]  And so out of all this lore, that's why Hitler cried when he had to bomb London, they said.
[2:47:36.400 --> 2:47:39.400]  And the British flew over and bombed Berlin.
[2:47:39.400 --> 2:47:44.400]  Hitler wouldn't bomb population centers because the British Arians were too precious.
[2:47:44.400 --> 2:47:49.400]  But then Churchill said, we've got to get British resolve behind this.
[2:47:49.400 --> 2:47:54.400]  And so they sent a bunch of liberators, a squadron of liberators to bomb civilian centers.
[2:47:54.400 --> 2:47:55.400]  This is mainline history.
[2:47:55.400 --> 2:48:02.400]  I've seen this on history channel to bomb Berlin.
[2:48:02.400 --> 2:48:05.400]  And so Hitler started the Blitz and he cried.
[2:48:05.400 --> 2:48:07.400]  Oh, his precious Arians were dying.
[2:48:07.400 --> 2:48:09.400]  His precious the Brits.
[2:48:09.400 --> 2:48:10.400]  Oh, it's horrible.
[2:48:10.400 --> 2:48:14.400]  I mean, this is how sick these people are, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:48:14.400 --> 2:48:27.400]  And whenever he flooded the bunkers and the subways, so the Russians couldn't use it, so he had a few more hours in his bunker.
[2:48:27.400 --> 2:48:30.400]  He said, well, I guess our Arians weren't as good as their Arians.
[2:48:30.400 --> 2:48:32.400]  And now I'm just worried the Russian Mongols will take over.
[2:48:32.400 --> 2:48:33.400]  Oh, this is horrible.
[2:48:33.400 --> 2:48:35.400]  Let me take cyanide.
[2:48:35.400 --> 2:48:48.400]  I mean, when you really know the history folks and not some skewed history, I have read no exaggeration over 100 thick history books, secret wartime reports, Nazi books.
[2:48:48.400 --> 2:48:54.400]  It's well more than I've probably read 30 or 40 books by Joseph Goebbels by Adolf Hitler.
[2:48:54.400 --> 2:48:56.400]  Okay, these are books published by them.
[2:48:56.400 --> 2:48:58.400]  This is not propaganda.
[2:48:58.400 --> 2:49:00.400]  Hitler was a communist.
[2:49:00.400 --> 2:49:02.400]  Joseph Goebbels was a communist.
[2:49:02.400 --> 2:49:05.400]  They wanted communism, but it wasn't popular.
[2:49:05.400 --> 2:49:12.400]  And when British intelligence was funding them, they wanted their own brand of communism to block Russian communism.
[2:49:12.400 --> 2:49:17.400]  And then they became from national socialists to fascist and then became anti-communist.
[2:49:17.400 --> 2:49:20.400]  And that's all on record.
[2:49:20.400 --> 2:49:22.400]  And Stalin admired Hitler.
[2:49:22.400 --> 2:49:23.400]  Hitler admired Stalin.
[2:49:23.400 --> 2:49:25.400]  They made a deal to divide Poland up.
[2:49:25.400 --> 2:49:31.400]  I mean, when you really know history and so George Bernard Schumann.
[2:49:31.400 --> 2:49:33.400]  We'll be talking about later in the next hour.
[2:49:33.400 --> 2:49:39.400]  He said, through the health departments, we're going to ban homeschooling.
[2:49:39.400 --> 2:49:45.400]  We're going to start with sterilization and drugging the water and then we're just going to start killing everybody.
[2:49:45.400 --> 2:49:47.400]  And he and Hitler exchanged letters.
[2:49:47.400 --> 2:49:49.400]  Shaw went and had repeated meetings.
[2:49:49.400 --> 2:49:57.400]  He had meetings with the head of IBM, Dr. Thomas Watson, and they all just said, well, the Soviets are putting fluoride in.
[2:49:57.400 --> 2:50:01.400]  That's sterilizing and brain damaging people. Let's do that.
[2:50:01.400 --> 2:50:05.400]  But they couldn't get that done until 1946 in the United States.
[2:50:05.400 --> 2:50:07.400]  And they all wrote books. We own them.
[2:50:07.400 --> 2:50:09.400]  And they all gave film interviews.
[2:50:09.400 --> 2:50:13.400]  I mean, I could play Hitler and video of him saying it.
[2:50:13.400 --> 2:50:14.400]  Film put the video.
[2:50:14.400 --> 2:50:16.400]  I mean, we're going to play Shaw coming up.
[2:50:16.400 --> 2:50:23.400]  Now, again, this audio was filmed in the 20s, this film, right when they were getting audio and film.
[2:50:23.400 --> 2:50:28.400]  And so, I mean, it's bad audio, but you can read books.
[2:50:28.400 --> 2:50:29.400]  He wrote saying it.
[2:50:29.400 --> 2:50:37.400]  And so all of this is to kill you, kill you, get it through your heads, folks.
[2:50:37.400 --> 2:50:41.400]  No exaggeration.
[2:50:41.400 --> 2:50:46.400]  I would bet that Aaron Dykes has read more than 50.
[2:50:46.400 --> 2:50:52.400]  I know we bought more than 50 and he's always reading them books on eugenics by the eugenicist.
[2:50:52.400 --> 2:50:55.400]  And they are running everything today.
[2:50:55.400 --> 2:51:01.400]  And they are mad dog control freak psychopathic murders.
[2:51:01.400 --> 2:51:06.400]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water filtration.
[2:51:06.400 --> 2:51:10.400]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands of satisfied customers,

[2:52:02.400 --> 2:52:06.400]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[2:52:06.400 --> 2:52:09.400]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[2:52:09.400 --> 2:52:14.400]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[2:52:14.400 --> 2:52:20.400]  We have turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[2:52:20.400 --> 2:52:26.400]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:52:26.400 --> 2:52:29.400]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[2:52:29.400 --> 2:52:36.400]  The criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[2:52:36.400 --> 2:52:42.400]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[2:52:42.400 --> 2:52:44.400]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[2:52:44.400 --> 2:52:49.400]  And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[2:52:49.400 --> 2:52:54.400]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.

[2:54:01.400 --> 2:54:09.400]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:54:16.400 --> 2:54:25.400]  To answer the caller's second question about secret government weapons, they have space planes with DU, meteor gun systems.
[2:54:25.400 --> 2:54:29.400]  That's the way Dr. Bob Bowman, the former head of Star Wars program, described it.
[2:54:29.400 --> 2:54:34.400]  They have particle beam weapons. Blue beam isn't a weapon system, it's a psych warfare system,
[2:54:34.400 --> 2:54:41.400]  which is a partially declassified program to have fake alien invasions or Buddha or Muhammad or Jesus return.
[2:54:41.400 --> 2:54:46.400]  That's even been in mainstream news that they've developed that, but a lot of it's secret.
[2:54:46.400 --> 2:54:54.400]  And a lot of different technologies are 10, 20, 30, 40 years more advanced than what the public is told about.
[2:54:54.400 --> 2:55:02.400]  And things are slowly doled out of the public that intensifies the tracking and control grid.
[2:55:02.400 --> 2:55:05.400]  So we are in a controlled scientific dictatorship.
[2:55:05.400 --> 2:55:13.400]  But consciousness, awareness of that, allows us to expose it and take control of the system.
[2:55:13.400 --> 2:55:19.400]  Let's talk to Robin in Holland. You're on the air, Robin. Thanks for holding.
[2:55:19.400 --> 2:55:24.400]  Hello, Alex. Welcome.
[2:55:24.400 --> 2:55:27.400]  Hey, thanks for having me.
[2:55:27.400 --> 2:55:29.400]  What's on your mind?
[2:55:29.400 --> 2:55:37.400]  I've sent you an email, a message via the site. We just figured we would change like, we're an activism group, by the way.
[2:55:37.400 --> 2:55:40.400]  You know us. I guess you do.
[2:55:40.400 --> 2:55:46.400]  We have a lot of snow and we have global warming and the IPCC and everybody and everything is warming up.
[2:55:46.400 --> 2:55:54.400]  But we have a lot of snow here in the Netherlands and that really it's the first in years that we have snow here in this amount.
[2:55:54.400 --> 2:56:02.400]  And I just lost a new ID. What if we would all make snowmen for El Gore?
[2:56:02.400 --> 2:56:08.400]  A little sign with it, you know, that says, I love CO2.
[2:56:08.400 --> 2:56:13.400]  Yeah, that's a good idea. I mean, all sorts of media stunts post them on YouTube.
[2:56:13.400 --> 2:56:17.400]  Conservatively, thousands will see it, millions potentially.
[2:56:17.400 --> 2:56:24.400]  And if everybody just becomes activist on the web and in person, that way you have a physical protest that people see on the street,
[2:56:24.400 --> 2:56:31.400]  then it's seen on the web, then others mimic it until we all stand up together and figure out that we're the majority.
[2:56:31.400 --> 2:56:36.400]  And all the sheep that feel like they're alone and isolated, they end up waking up as well.
[2:56:36.400 --> 2:56:39.400]  That's the process of awakening.
[2:56:39.400 --> 2:56:45.400]  Exactly. And we just thought it was a nice idea, you know. But people can do this together, they can do it in groups.
[2:56:45.400 --> 2:56:49.400]  But for all, I don't care, they can create an old army of snowmen, you know.
[2:56:49.400 --> 2:56:53.400]  Put an old sign on top of it with El Gore, we're coming for you or something.
[2:56:53.400 --> 2:56:57.400]  It's going to be a lot of fun. You can do a lot of things with this.
[2:56:57.400 --> 2:57:01.400]  And we put a link on the website. I've also sent you the email, the link to it.
[2:57:01.400 --> 2:57:09.400]  It's on WAC Holland.org. That's our website. Our website is for short. We are Change Holland.
[2:57:09.400 --> 2:57:15.400]  And it's right on the front. Everybody can see it. And we will create a photo album where everybody can upload their own pictures,
[2:57:15.400 --> 2:57:22.400]  their own stuff. So people can vote. And we're thinking about putting the best thing on our website on the front page for a couple of weeks.
[2:57:22.400 --> 2:57:30.400]  You could have the snowmen with signs like record cold temperatures in the last 100 years, some areas record cold in the last 25.
[2:57:30.400 --> 2:57:36.400]  Got global warming. We're coming for you, El Gore. We're going to give you a snowball.
[2:57:36.400 --> 2:57:39.400]  Absolutely. Great points. Good to hear from you, Robin.
[2:57:39.400 --> 2:57:43.400]  Let's talk to Terrence in Detroit. Terrence, go ahead.
[2:57:43.400 --> 2:57:50.400]  Hey, Alex, I hope I can fit it in. I got to talk to James Conboy there in New York about the Kressie family.
[2:57:50.400 --> 2:57:57.400]  I got through to him on his lunch break. And basically, I just asked him to read the Constitution and set him free.
[2:57:57.400 --> 2:58:02.400]  He got into a discussion on how they should be educating their children and everything.
[2:58:02.400 --> 2:58:10.400]  And I asked him, if you really wanted to help him, why didn't you knock on their door and offer him a better way to teach their kids to read
[2:58:10.400 --> 2:58:13.400]  instead of arresting them and force them to jump through hoops?
[2:58:13.400 --> 2:58:15.400]  And what did he say to that?
[2:58:15.400 --> 2:58:21.400]  He said, I didn't arrest him. And I said that you didn't order him to be set free. So you're part of the arresting process.
[2:58:21.400 --> 2:58:27.400]  I said, basically, it was just set him free, let him... Did he say he's getting a lot of phone calls?
[2:58:27.400 --> 2:58:33.400]  No, he didn't mention his phone calls. He wanted my name, but I just said my name is irrelevant.
[2:58:33.400 --> 2:58:37.400]  I'm just a concerned citizen that wants people to be... Stay there. Stay there.
[2:58:37.400 --> 2:58:39.400]  We'll talk about this case when we come back. Stay with us.
[2:58:39.400 --> 2:58:49.400]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:59:10.400 --> 2:59:15.400]  Number 3. In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[2:59:15.400 --> 2:59:19.400]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[2:59:19.400 --> 2:59:22.400]  Number 4. Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[2:59:22.400 --> 2:59:26.400]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[2:59:26.400 --> 2:59:31.400]  Number 5. A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:59:31.400 --> 2:59:36.400]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[2:59:36.400 --> 2:59:40.400]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[2:59:40.400 --> 2:59:42.400]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:59:42.400 --> 3:00:10.400]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[3:00:12.400 --> 3:00:20.400]  Okay, I'm going to make a few more calls right now.
[3:00:20.400 --> 3:00:22.400]  I'm going to blitz through news in the next segment.
[3:00:22.400 --> 3:00:25.400]  And Aaron Dice is going to be in studio with us on some key issues.
[3:00:25.400 --> 3:00:27.400]  You'll want to stay with us for that.
[3:00:27.400 --> 3:00:31.400]  Because you need to read the writings of Margaret Sanger.
[3:00:31.400 --> 3:00:36.400]  You need to read the writings of Bertrand Russell, George Bernard Shaw, all of them.
[3:00:36.400 --> 3:00:42.400]  Aldous Huxley, Julian Huxley, hundreds of them.
[3:00:42.400 --> 3:00:44.400]  Scientific global government.
[3:00:44.400 --> 3:00:45.400]  We're going to sterilize you.
[3:00:45.400 --> 3:00:47.400]  We're going to kill you.
[3:00:47.400 --> 3:00:49.400]  We're going to euthanize the old.
[3:00:49.400 --> 3:00:55.400]  And now they're making their move, pushing it out in the open.
[3:00:55.400 --> 3:01:04.400]  Okay, going back to Terrence in Detroit, I have an email here from the superintendent in this rural New York state school district.
[3:01:04.400 --> 3:01:08.400]  It's a family law abiding kids being educated.
[3:01:08.400 --> 3:01:10.400]  There was a little civil matter.
[3:01:10.400 --> 3:01:15.400]  I've read the code of saying they're supposed to just register and let the school know that they're being instructed privately.
[3:01:15.400 --> 3:01:20.400]  Now, in the article Kurt Nemo wrote, we show where other states are trying to outright ban it now.
[3:01:20.400 --> 3:01:21.400]  Germany's done it.
[3:01:21.400 --> 3:01:22.400]  England's trying.
[3:01:22.400 --> 3:01:24.400]  It's the same global process in every country.
[3:01:24.400 --> 3:01:26.400]  It's globally managed.
[3:01:26.400 --> 3:01:27.400]  This is a fact.
[3:01:27.400 --> 3:01:29.400]  They brag about it.
[3:01:29.400 --> 3:01:31.400]  And so to make an example of them, they arrested them.
[3:01:31.400 --> 3:01:34.400]  The media said enough wasn't done.
[3:01:34.400 --> 3:01:36.400]  The CPS is talking about taking their children now.
[3:01:36.400 --> 3:01:38.400]  They didn't arrest them for not having them in school.
[3:01:38.400 --> 3:01:40.400]  They couldn't do that in public school.
[3:01:40.400 --> 3:01:43.400]  They arrested them for child endangerment.
[3:01:43.400 --> 3:01:45.400]  That's in the news report.
[3:01:45.400 --> 3:01:49.400]  And these idiots comment on my website going, they deserve to be arrested.
[3:01:49.400 --> 3:01:52.400]  Boy, the government's going to abuse you and you're not going to like it.
[3:01:52.400 --> 3:01:57.400]  But I have his email here and it says, thank you for your concern.
[3:01:57.400 --> 3:02:02.400]  This is Dr. James D. Hoffman.
[3:02:02.400 --> 3:02:11.400]  And he is in the article here.
[3:02:11.400 --> 3:02:12.400]  I guess we didn't give his number out.
[3:02:12.400 --> 3:02:15.400]  We gave out the Montgomery County Sheriff.
[3:02:15.400 --> 3:02:18.400]  We gave out the district attorney, child protective services in the court.
[3:02:18.400 --> 3:02:22.400]  I guess we never gave out the phone number for the superintendent.
[3:02:22.400 --> 3:02:24.400]  I guess he's already getting calls.
[3:02:24.400 --> 3:02:27.400]  And it said, thank you for your concern.
[3:02:27.400 --> 3:02:28.400]  This is one of our listeners.
[3:02:28.400 --> 3:02:31.400]  It's unfortunate the situation had gained national notoriety
[3:02:31.400 --> 3:02:35.400]  and plunged both the family and the school district into such an unfamiliar spotlight.
[3:02:35.400 --> 3:02:37.400]  Neither deserve this level of security.
[3:02:37.400 --> 3:02:41.400]  No, you and the police need to know you're acting like a bunch of thugs.
[3:02:41.400 --> 3:02:43.400]  This is not Soviet Russia.
[3:02:43.400 --> 3:02:46.400]  Nazi Germany, everywhere else they had government schooling.
[3:02:46.400 --> 3:02:48.400]  Home schooling was banned.
[3:02:48.400 --> 3:02:49.400]  The government's trying to ban it.
[3:02:49.400 --> 3:02:51.400]  Don't you get it, buddy?
[3:02:51.400 --> 3:02:55.400]  I met with the parents on January 5th, reviewed their curriculum
[3:02:55.400 --> 3:02:58.400]  and helped set them on the path to bring them into compliance with state law
[3:02:58.400 --> 3:03:00.400]  just after they were arrested.
[3:03:00.400 --> 3:03:06.400]  I expect this will soon be resolved quietly and amicably away from public eyes.
[3:03:06.400 --> 3:03:07.400]  Okay?
[3:03:07.400 --> 3:03:09.400]  And then he goes on from there to say,
[3:03:09.400 --> 3:03:13.400]  oh, because one 18-year-old in our town couldn't read good after homeschooling.
[3:03:13.400 --> 3:03:14.400]  We have to do this.
[3:03:14.400 --> 3:03:20.400]  It's like France is in the news saying we had 150 husbands and wives kill themselves last year.
[3:03:20.400 --> 3:03:26.400]  So we're banning yelling at each other to get husbands and wives taddling on each other to break up the family.
[3:03:26.400 --> 3:03:29.400]  And this is the government taking over the family.
[3:03:29.400 --> 3:03:33.400]  Oh, because 150 died out of 61,500,000 in France.
[3:03:33.400 --> 3:03:36.400]  All the French have to be slaves.
[3:03:36.400 --> 3:03:38.400]  This is guilty until proven innocent.
[3:03:38.400 --> 3:03:39.400]  This is slavery.
[3:03:39.400 --> 3:03:46.400]  Finish up with talking to Dr. James D. Hoffman, the superintendent of these Orwellian schools.
[3:03:46.400 --> 3:03:48.400]  What did he say to you on the phone?
[3:03:48.400 --> 3:03:51.400]  Well, I was with Mr. Conboy.
[3:03:51.400 --> 3:03:56.400]  And I said, why don't you let the parents teach your children to read?
[3:03:56.400 --> 3:03:58.400]  And he said, well, they can't read.
[3:03:58.400 --> 3:03:59.400]  Okay, so I was wrong.
[3:03:59.400 --> 3:04:00.400]  You didn't talk to the superintendent.
[3:04:00.400 --> 3:04:01.400]  You talked to Conboy.
[3:04:01.400 --> 3:04:02.400]  That's his name.
[3:04:02.400 --> 3:04:04.400]  James Conboy, the district attorney.
[3:04:04.400 --> 3:04:05.400]  Correct.
[3:04:05.400 --> 3:04:06.400]  And he said, well, they can't read.
[3:04:06.400 --> 3:04:08.400]  And I said, did you test them?
[3:04:08.400 --> 3:04:14.400]  I said, why don't you pull 12, 18-year-old 12-creators out of a school district in your area,
[3:04:14.400 --> 3:04:16.400]  give them a paragraph and tell them to diagram it.
[3:04:16.400 --> 3:04:17.400]  They can't do it.
[3:04:17.400 --> 3:04:22.400]  You're graduating idiots, yet you want to force this family to put their kids in public
[3:04:22.400 --> 3:04:24.400]  school so you can get government funds.
[3:04:24.400 --> 3:04:25.400]  That's the only reason you're doing this.
[3:04:25.400 --> 3:04:29.400]  You don't care about them, because if you did, you'd knock on their door and offer them a
[3:04:29.400 --> 3:04:30.400]  bill.
[3:04:30.400 --> 3:04:31.400]  And what did he say about you?
[3:04:31.400 --> 3:04:34.400]  He didn't say, he just wanted my name.
[3:04:34.400 --> 3:04:35.400]  I said, my name is irrelevant.
[3:04:35.400 --> 3:04:37.400]  I'm just a concerned citizen that wants to be free.
[3:04:37.400 --> 3:04:41.400]  And once you just have the trustee family free, let them be free.
[3:04:41.400 --> 3:04:43.400]  Leave them alone.
[3:04:43.400 --> 3:04:47.400]  And hopefully he'll listen, maybe he'll open his eyes a little bit.
[3:04:47.400 --> 3:04:51.400]  But at least I got through to him, and he did give me five minutes.
[3:04:51.400 --> 3:04:53.400]  All right, good job.
[3:04:53.400 --> 3:04:55.400]  More calls straight ahead.
[3:04:55.400 --> 3:04:56.400]  Thank you, Terrence.
[3:04:56.400 --> 3:04:58.400]  Jason, Randy, others.
[3:04:58.400 --> 3:05:00.400]  First, I'm going to hit some news.
[3:05:00.400 --> 3:05:17.400]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[3:05:17.400 --> 3:05:22.400]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[3:05:22.400 --> 3:05:26.400]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[3:05:26.400 --> 3:05:32.400]  And also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued
[3:05:32.400 --> 3:05:35.400]  legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products.
[3:05:35.400 --> 3:05:41.400]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[3:05:41.400 --> 3:05:46.400]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[3:05:46.400 --> 3:05:52.400]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the
[3:05:52.400 --> 3:05:54.400]  Silver Lungs Generator.
[3:05:54.400 --> 3:06:02.400]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[3:06:02.400 --> 3:06:06.400]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:06:06.400 --> 3:06:10.400]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:06:10.400 --> 3:06:15.400]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[3:06:15.400 --> 3:06:21.400]  We have tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[3:06:21.400 --> 3:06:26.400]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:06:26.400 --> 3:06:29.400]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[3:06:29.400 --> 3:06:36.400]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:06:36.400 --> 3:06:38.400]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[3:06:38.400 --> 3:06:42.400]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[3:06:42.400 --> 3:06:44.400]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[3:06:44.400 --> 3:06:49.400]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[3:06:49.400 --> 3:06:54.400]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[3:06:54.400 --> 3:07:00.400]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:07:00.400 --> 3:07:05.400]  Our economy is in great distress.
[3:07:05.400 --> 3:07:08.400]  The financial dominoes can fall at any time.
[3:07:08.400 --> 3:07:14.400]  It's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen and prepare just in case it does.
[3:07:14.400 --> 3:07:16.400]  You have auto and home insurance.
[3:07:16.400 --> 3:07:19.400]  Why wouldn't you have food insurance?
[3:07:19.400 --> 3:07:23.400]  Are you prepared to feed your family long term?
[3:07:23.400 --> 3:07:25.400]  Because it might take years to recover.
[3:07:25.400 --> 3:07:32.400]  As the adult, it's your responsibility to feed your family, especially during rough times.
[3:07:32.400 --> 3:07:40.400]  Survivalistseeds.com is offering a package that will give you a 3-acre heirloom vegetable garden anywhere.
[3:07:40.400 --> 3:07:47.400]  50 heirloom varieties, 8,000 vegetable seeds, over 5 pounds of healthy food.
[3:07:47.400 --> 3:07:52.400]  Don't be fooled by marketing companies disguised as patriots.
[3:07:52.400 --> 3:08:11.400]  Survivalistseeds.com is owned by Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me Radio Show.
[3:08:22.400 --> 3:08:40.400]  There's a lot of pressure out there in the economy, and all the major studies show that when they adopted death education,
[3:08:40.400 --> 3:08:43.400]  teaching kids how to commit suicide in the name of not doing it,
[3:08:43.400 --> 3:08:46.400]  suicides exploded in the early 1990s.
[3:08:46.400 --> 3:08:53.400]  The more death education these globalist ghouls bring in, the more suicides we see.
[3:08:53.400 --> 3:08:56.400]  Over and over and over again.
[3:08:56.400 --> 3:09:03.400]  And as the media hypes mass shootings and hypes death by cop suicide, getting the cops to shoot you,
[3:09:03.400 --> 3:09:09.400]  or death by mass shooting, where you go in and shoot a bunch of people then kill yourself,
[3:09:09.400 --> 3:09:14.400]  the more people have that idea introduced to themselves.
[3:09:14.400 --> 3:09:19.400]  It's like so-called sex education to elementary students.
[3:09:19.400 --> 3:09:21.400]  Then they suddenly start experimenting sexually.
[3:09:21.400 --> 3:09:23.400]  They weren't even thinking about that.
[3:09:23.400 --> 3:09:32.400]  They're thinking about superheroes and football and wrestling and TV shows.
[3:09:32.400 --> 3:09:35.400]  They're not thinking about sex, but they introduce it into their minds.
[3:09:35.400 --> 3:09:39.400]  And the social engineers, again, I've read their books, their own publications.
[3:09:39.400 --> 3:09:43.400]  They knew what they were doing, screwing up society and the family.
[3:09:43.400 --> 3:09:49.400]  They said, we've got to screw up society, break up the family, get people dependent and move forward.
[3:09:49.400 --> 3:09:53.400]  And so when I see stories like this as the economy implodes,
[3:09:53.400 --> 3:09:57.400]  100 years ago people wouldn't go in a factory, even if they got fired and shoot people up,
[3:09:57.400 --> 3:10:01.400]  but it's advertised as what people do.
[3:10:01.400 --> 3:10:03.400]  And so now it's in people's minds.
[3:10:03.400 --> 3:10:05.400]  The more they hype this.
[3:10:05.400 --> 3:10:10.400]  You know, the media hype for a year, wearing green hats with a red feather,
[3:10:10.400 --> 3:10:15.400]  you'd see 100 million people wearing green hats with red feathers.
[3:10:15.400 --> 3:10:21.400]  It's like if I get a puppy and I start bouncing a ball or doing catch with it, it's going to start doing catch.
[3:10:21.400 --> 3:10:24.400]  They are training the public to do this.
[3:10:24.400 --> 3:10:27.400]  An employee armed with an assault rifle and a handgun,
[3:10:27.400 --> 3:10:31.400]  walks into a manufacturing plant Thursday morning at open fire, killing at least three people,
[3:10:31.400 --> 3:10:33.400]  and wounding five others, as the authority said.
[3:10:33.400 --> 3:10:39.400]  Several hours later, police were still inside, Swiss made ABB.
[3:10:39.400 --> 3:10:42.400]  Well, they make nuclear reactors for the North Koreans.
[3:10:42.400 --> 3:10:47.400]  Donald Rumsfeld signed that deal off when Clinton was in.
[3:10:47.400 --> 3:10:50.400]  Going room to room in search of the gunmen and additional victims.
[3:10:50.400 --> 3:10:52.400]  Took them hours to do that.
[3:10:52.400 --> 3:11:01.400]  Police Captain Sam Dotson said authorities had not confirmed whether the shooter was among the eight.
[3:11:01.400 --> 3:11:06.400]  He'd been an employee in the plant, they're saying, they believe the main suspect was.
[3:11:06.400 --> 3:11:11.400]  By the way, you've got the public schools saying they own your kids and you've got to basically keep them with them
[3:11:11.400 --> 3:11:13.400]  or register them with the schools.
[3:11:13.400 --> 3:11:18.400]  Once you start registering, then they go ahead and ban homeschooling outright.
[3:11:18.400 --> 3:11:24.400]  Registering and getting a license is an authorization to do something that would be illegal.
[3:11:24.400 --> 3:11:29.400]  Again, I want to remind you of the Associated Press.
[3:11:29.400 --> 3:11:38.400]  14 years after we exposed it, Texas has destroyed baby blood taken without consent and a secret DNA database.
[3:11:38.400 --> 3:11:46.400]  Underseen by the settlement by San Antonio federal court, the blood samples collected without parental consent
[3:11:46.400 --> 3:11:48.400]  must be destroyed by early next year.
[3:11:48.400 --> 3:11:50.400]  It's all part of a UN database.
[3:11:50.400 --> 3:11:53.400]  They don't tell you all that, though, here in the article.
[3:11:53.400 --> 3:11:56.400]  That's just people assuming in Minnesota and Texas.
[3:11:56.400 --> 3:11:59.400]  Here's another one, San Antonio Express News.
[3:11:59.400 --> 3:12:02.400]  State to destroy blood samples.
[3:12:02.400 --> 3:12:04.400]  I mean, do they have a right to take your blood?
[3:12:04.400 --> 3:12:07.400]  Do they have a right to naked body scan your family?
[3:12:07.400 --> 3:12:09.400]  No, they don't.
[3:12:09.400 --> 3:12:19.400]  And if you say no to them, they won't be able to get away with it anymore.
[3:12:19.400 --> 3:12:25.400]  Continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, CNN reports government uses stimulus money to buy the naked body scanners.
[3:12:25.400 --> 3:12:28.400]  That's what your stimulus is.
[3:12:28.400 --> 3:12:31.400]  Here's another propaganda report out of Fox News.
[3:12:31.400 --> 3:12:34.400]  Give me a close shot of this for Prison Planet TV viewers.
[3:12:34.400 --> 3:12:42.400]  Radio Lizards, Google, or startpage.com, the term, can cell phones cure Alzheimer's?
[3:12:42.400 --> 3:12:45.400]  And then it goes into rat studies saying it cured them of their Alzheimer's.
[3:12:45.400 --> 3:12:47.400]  Radiation is good for your brain.
[3:12:47.400 --> 3:12:52.400]  This is the same government that tells you Mercury is now good for your brain
[3:12:52.400 --> 3:12:59.400]  and that melamine that the Chinese admit is killing people is good for you and 90% of milk in the United States.
[3:12:59.400 --> 3:13:05.400]  In fact, we have that Chinese newscast in English about the melamine and the milk I sent you last night.
[3:13:05.400 --> 3:13:07.400]  Yeah, cue that up for me.
[3:13:07.400 --> 3:13:09.400]  I want to play that in a few minutes.
[3:13:09.400 --> 3:13:13.400]  Notice how they're in the Asian news still saying melamine's deadly.
[3:13:13.400 --> 3:13:15.400]  It killed a bunch of people last year, remember?
[3:13:15.400 --> 3:13:18.400]  Here they just say, no, melamine's not bad for you.
[3:13:18.400 --> 3:13:21.400]  Folks, they think you're the biggest idiots on earth.
[3:13:21.400 --> 3:13:25.400]  Look at this sickening story.
[3:13:25.400 --> 3:13:27.400]  London Guardian and they report it like it's a good thing.
[3:13:27.400 --> 3:13:30.400]  But then every comment I read was this is sick.
[3:13:30.400 --> 3:13:31.400]  This is Orwellian.
[3:13:31.400 --> 3:13:32.400]  This is eugenics.
[3:13:32.400 --> 3:13:33.400]  This is Brave New World.
[3:13:33.400 --> 3:13:38.400]  If you want to, first it started with people with dementia.
[3:13:38.400 --> 3:13:45.400]  Now they're saying anybody that wants to be in a nursing home has to have a feeding tube fitted before you get admitted with your government funding.
[3:13:45.400 --> 3:13:47.400]  So they can just plug you in.
[3:13:47.400 --> 3:13:50.400]  It says you won't even have the pleasure of eating anymore.
[3:13:50.400 --> 3:13:53.400]  They just want to get rid of you and pop you full of morphine.
[3:13:53.400 --> 3:13:57.400]  Care homes forcing elderly to have feeding tubes fitted.
[3:13:57.400 --> 3:14:04.400]  Thousands of elderly people are being forced to have feeding tubes fitted so they can be artificially fed if they want to be admitted to a care home.
[3:14:04.400 --> 3:14:06.400]  A major report warns today.
[3:14:06.400 --> 3:14:13.400]  There's no evidence that feeding tube prolongs life and it deprives patients of the pleasure of social contact involved in normal eating and drinking.
[3:14:13.400 --> 3:14:19.400]  It says Royal College Physicians Working Group, which recommends the artificial nutrition should only be used as a last resort.
[3:14:19.400 --> 3:14:24.400]  So we're going to warehouse you and go ahead and get rid of you.
[3:14:24.400 --> 3:14:27.400]  Here's another sickening report also out of the Guardian.
[3:14:27.400 --> 3:14:37.400]  Britain must launch GM Food Revolution says Chief Scientist to stop food shortages when the governments of England and the U.S. pay farmers not to grow crops.
[3:14:37.400 --> 3:14:43.400]  That's on record saying climate change demands it.
[3:14:43.400 --> 3:14:46.400]  Saying the earth's warming, there'll be less food.
[3:14:46.400 --> 3:14:54.400]  Every major study going back for thousands of years, everybody knows when the earth warms up, you get higher yields of crops.
[3:14:54.400 --> 3:14:58.400]  Again, oh, if you're an environmentalist, you must be for GMO.
[3:14:58.400 --> 3:15:04.400]  See how they turn everything upside down?
[3:15:04.400 --> 3:15:13.400]  The government's releasing a report that's secret so everybody gets it and goes over it of how the airline bomber was able to get on and how they screwed up,
[3:15:13.400 --> 3:15:16.400]  they're going to give you more security and take all your rights, don't you worry.
[3:15:16.400 --> 3:15:21.400]  National Security Advisor, airline bomber report to shock the public.
[3:15:21.400 --> 3:15:34.400]  You know, it's kind of like whenever they said that, oh, Katrina was a screw up, we'll give FEMA even more power.
[3:15:34.400 --> 3:15:38.400]  Body scanners increase privacy says corporate media.
[3:15:38.400 --> 3:15:46.400]  Paul Watson wrote an article for prisonplanet.com and it goes over how wonderful it is and how it protects your privacy.
[3:15:46.400 --> 3:15:51.400]  Now you don't have to be strip searched, the cameras just do it.
[3:15:51.400 --> 3:16:00.400]  See, imagine if they tried to videotape you while they strip searched you, you would revolt.
[3:16:00.400 --> 3:16:06.400]  But because they do it and openly record it and a camera does it, a scanner does it, then it's okay.
[3:16:06.400 --> 3:16:10.400]  Imagine if they recorded the strip searching physically, there'd be a revolt.
[3:16:10.400 --> 3:16:14.400]  But because they're recording it with a machine, it's okay.
[3:16:14.400 --> 3:16:21.400]  By the way, where's that comment by that well-known author that sent us the email about what he saw in TSA?
[3:16:21.400 --> 3:16:24.400]  Yeah, bring it into me again. Thanks. I want to go over that.
[3:16:24.400 --> 3:16:27.400]  I had it yesterday.
[3:16:27.400 --> 3:16:29.400]  Here it is.
[3:16:29.400 --> 3:16:32.400]  This is a ticket came into our email and he's got it up on his website.
[3:16:32.400 --> 3:16:36.400]  He said he was coming through Gatwick Airport, London, England.
[3:16:36.400 --> 3:16:42.400]  Comments to the TSA, I'm a New York Times best-selling ghostwriter and editor of many fiction and nonfiction books.
[3:16:42.400 --> 3:16:49.400]  I edited Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code, also a former Army Ranger corporate mercenary, nine years, 211 overseas missions.
[3:16:49.400 --> 3:16:57.400]  One recent flight to Gatwick, I witnessed a beautiful blonde being ordered to submit to enter Patdown or full body scan.
[3:16:57.400 --> 3:17:02.400]  She was the only person in line who was subjected to the treatment. I have seen this with the Patdowns.
[3:17:02.400 --> 3:17:07.400]  Every perv in America goes to do this. They get the power and they wave them out and they just start squeezing.
[3:17:07.400 --> 3:17:09.400]  Everybody's seen it.
[3:17:09.400 --> 3:17:15.400]  And the women get real mad and if they get mad, they taser you and beat you to death in some cases.
[3:17:15.400 --> 3:17:18.400]  And then say, oh, she killed herself in handcuffs.
[3:17:18.400 --> 3:17:23.400]  The handcuffs got around her neck and killed her. Remember that?
[3:17:23.400 --> 3:17:26.400]  She opted for scan instead of being felt up.
[3:17:26.400 --> 3:17:33.400]  I heard officers snickering when they crowded around to monitor the woman's scan, revealing only what her husband should be privy to.
[3:17:33.400 --> 3:17:46.400]  I suppose as the lady's husband, I could call my attorneys in Lauderdale and D.C. and file a complaint against TSA, but I've opted instead to write about it.
[3:17:46.400 --> 3:17:52.400]  Happy New Year, you abusive a-holes. Tell the TSA officers they're a bunch of scum.
[3:17:52.400 --> 3:18:00.400]  So, ladies and gentlemen, this is how your dog trained to be a slave.
[3:18:00.400 --> 3:18:06.400]  All you police officers, do you want your kids living in a country where they naked body scan them and grow up women?
[3:18:06.400 --> 3:18:12.400]  Do you really believe all this bull you're told is just really what you want to be part of?
[3:18:12.400 --> 3:18:17.400]  I know most of the TSA people aren't perverts. You should say no. Your unions should say no.
[3:18:17.400 --> 3:18:25.400]  Several times, well, the last five or six times I've flown, the majority of the time, TSA, NLA, other cities in Austin,
[3:18:25.400 --> 3:18:29.400]  Billings, Montana was nightmare. It was like Nazi Germany.
[3:18:29.400 --> 3:18:35.400]  But other places, they go, Alex, I'm a fan. It happened in Newark.
[3:18:35.400 --> 3:18:39.400]  And listen, we're getting a union soon. We don't like what's going on. We know it's stupid. It's just a job.
[3:18:39.400 --> 3:18:44.400]  I'm a fan of your show over and over again, so I don't want to just say they're all scum.
[3:18:44.400 --> 3:18:51.400]  But I've seen the news with a good looking woman in the scanner and they show the guy looking at the thing, seeing her naked image.
[3:18:51.400 --> 3:18:57.400]  The media doesn't point that out. But we know what they're looking at from the scans and the guy's smiling.
[3:18:57.400 --> 3:19:05.400]  I mean, I would be so embarrassed to herd a good looking woman in or anybody else and get off on looking at their naked body.
[3:19:05.400 --> 3:19:15.400]  This is perverted, man. I find it very unsexually stimulating to force things on people.
[3:19:15.400 --> 3:19:22.400]  The whole enjoyment, but I guess I'm normal, is people liking it.
[3:19:22.400 --> 3:19:29.400]  The giving, I don't want to get into it. I mean, isn't it normal? You want the person to like it? Isn't it normal?
[3:19:29.400 --> 3:19:37.400]  That's 100% of the excitement. But no, a lot of sadistic people in history and police and others, they like raping people.
[3:19:37.400 --> 3:19:44.400]  They like abusing. They get off on it. Look at what every conquering army does. They rape every good looking woman in the city.
[3:19:44.400 --> 3:19:49.400]  Our troops admittedly didn't in World War II.
[3:19:49.400 --> 3:19:58.400]  I got a bunch of other news, but I'm going to go ahead and get Aaron Dykes in here now to go ahead and start getting into George Bernard Shaw and others.
[3:19:58.400 --> 3:20:01.400]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:20:28.400 --> 3:20:32.400]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[3:20:58.400 --> 3:21:11.400]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[3:21:11.400 --> 3:21:17.400]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system. Wisdom being lost with time.
[3:21:17.400 --> 3:21:27.400]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[3:21:27.400 --> 3:21:36.400]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[3:21:36.400 --> 3:21:41.400]  Now, foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[3:21:41.400 --> 3:21:45.400]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[3:21:45.400 --> 3:21:53.400]  Call me today at 800-686-2237. I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[3:21:53.400 --> 3:22:02.400]  Call today at 800-686-2237. Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[3:22:02.400 --> 3:22:10.400]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:22:10.400 --> 3:22:15.400]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[3:22:15.400 --> 3:22:21.400]  We have tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[3:22:21.400 --> 3:22:26.400]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:22:26.400 --> 3:22:36.400]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, held bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:22:36.400 --> 3:22:42.400]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[3:22:42.400 --> 3:22:50.400]  Today, it seems like nobody does care. And right now, in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[3:22:50.400 --> 3:22:55.400]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[3:22:55.400 --> 3:23:21.400]  We're watching online right now in Super High Quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[3:23:26.400 --> 3:23:32.400]  Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[3:23:32.400 --> 3:23:36.400]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:23:36.400 --> 3:23:42.400]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[3:23:42.400 --> 3:23:45.400]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[3:23:45.400 --> 3:23:56.400]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:23:56.400 --> 3:24:21.400]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[3:24:26.400 --> 3:24:54.400]  If you went to Hitler, at least in France, part of the socialist went to become advocates of Hitler.
[3:24:56.400 --> 3:25:01.400]  The popular British playwright Bernard Shaw supported Hitler in the mass media.
[3:25:01.400 --> 3:25:09.400]  The left supported Hitler not because he deceived them. They knew Hitler would kill. He said he would.
[3:25:09.400 --> 3:25:14.400]  In fact, it was why they supported him.
[3:25:14.400 --> 3:25:28.400]  You must all know half a dozen people at least who are using this word. Who are more trouble than they are worth. Just put them there and say, sir or madam, now we'll be kind enough to justify your existence.
[3:25:28.400 --> 3:25:39.400]  If you can't justify your existence, if you're not putting your weight in the social growth, if you're not producing as much as you consume, or perhaps a little more,
[3:25:39.400 --> 3:25:56.400]  then clearly, you cannot use the big organization of our society for the purpose of keeping you alive because your life does not benefit us and it can't be of any much use to you.
[3:25:56.400 --> 3:26:10.400]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. Aaron Dykes is in studio. Now, that's really bad audio. In fact, they gave me the documentary film This Is From. Well, you bring it into me. Thanks, guys. There's so much going on here.
[3:26:10.400 --> 3:26:18.400]  And I really wanted to properly introduce this. So just what I'm going to do is I'm going to introduce this coming up in the next segment because I was doing a radio interview during the four minute break.
[3:26:18.400 --> 3:26:31.400]  And then I wanted to pre talk to you, Aaron, before we went with this. There's just so much happening. This is from the Soviet story. And we separately from film archives gotten this as well, a film by Mr. Snor.
[3:26:31.400 --> 3:26:51.400]  And Aaron has done deep research on this for the next film that we've got coming up, Fall of the Republic II, that gets into the death plot, the New World Order takeover system. So what we're going to do is we're going to get into these different individuals coming up when we start the next segment.
[3:26:51.400 --> 3:27:03.400]  And the problem is there's so much evidence of these people's mass murder, so much evidence of their evil. We've got another clip that Aaron just ran in with right before he went live that is him praising Mussolini.
[3:27:03.400 --> 3:27:18.400]  And again, when you're watching this later at PrisonPlanet.tv or live, the audio is so low and old and bad, shot the 20s and 30s, the different film clips of these different globalist like George Bernard Shaw that with the video, you could see his lips moving and kind of make it out.
[3:27:18.400 --> 3:27:30.400]  Audio wise, without the video, it's weird how bad audio, when you have the video as well, it like helps you almost lip read what he's saying. But Shaw published books and articles where he said all this and more.
[3:27:30.400 --> 3:27:37.400]  And Aaron's got some of those quotes and documentation, but this is somebody who is praised by the left.
[3:27:37.400 --> 3:27:49.400]  And he praised Hitler, he praised Stalin, he praised Lenin, he praised Mussolini, he praised dictatorships, scientific dictatorships, scientific societies, that's coming up after the break.
[3:27:49.400 --> 3:27:57.400]  But right now, let's take a call. John, who's up next here?
[3:27:57.400 --> 3:28:01.400]  Jason in New Hampshire, you're on the air.
[3:28:01.400 --> 3:28:02.400]  Hello?
[3:28:02.400 --> 3:28:03.400]  Yes, sir.
[3:28:03.400 --> 3:28:10.400]  Hi, quick question and comment about these naked rape body scanners there.
[3:28:10.400 --> 3:28:17.400]  The image you guys posted of the woman with the gun, is that the standard photo that these scanners produce?
[3:28:17.400 --> 3:28:27.400]  Yes. In fact, it's more detailed. It's super high res, you can blow them up right down to her pores. And then the news always shows you a blurred one.
[3:28:27.400 --> 3:28:36.400]  Right, right. Well, with that image, like all you really have to do is reverse the negative and you have a full color, regular image of the person.
[3:28:36.400 --> 3:28:40.400]  And that's the standard that that's what we're looking at.
[3:28:40.400 --> 3:28:44.400]  You know, that's a good idea. We need to reverse the negative on her and show people.
[3:28:44.400 --> 3:28:49.400]  But I mean, it's already, you can see every detail of her breast, every detail of her.
[3:28:49.400 --> 3:29:00.400]  And I mean, this is outrageous. I mean, I'm not a shy person, but I am shy about a bunch of goons looking at my genitals. I mean, if they can do this, but that's what George Bertrand Shaw wanted.
[3:29:00.400 --> 3:29:06.400]  Same sex toilets and everything is to break down our species, get rid of who we are.
[3:29:06.400 --> 3:29:12.400]  And now look at how they're putting in same sex bathrooms in the military at colleges, and they all say why they're doing it.
[3:29:12.400 --> 3:29:18.400]  It's not just us saying they're breaking up the family and the human order. They say it.
[3:29:18.400 --> 3:29:27.400]  Absolutely. Also, if you're listeners, you can check out a couple of studies online about how terahertz waves can tear apart the DNA.
[3:29:27.400 --> 3:29:36.400]  We've posted major medical studies, mainline scientific publications saying this is deadly, and it's the body load of this.
[3:29:36.400 --> 3:29:41.400]  And these technicians running these machines, they're going to all wonder why their testicles rot off.
[3:29:41.400 --> 3:29:44.400]  Because those are outside the body and will pick up the most radiation.
[3:29:44.400 --> 3:29:51.400]  But they like to stick to their cancer. So what they want is what they get.
[3:29:51.400 --> 3:30:02.400]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:02.400 --> 3:30:09.400]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:30:09.400 --> 3:30:15.400]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[3:30:15.400 --> 3:30:21.400]  They've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[3:30:21.400 --> 3:30:26.400]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:30:26.400 --> 3:30:36.400]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:30:36.400 --> 3:30:42.400]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[3:30:42.400 --> 3:30:49.400]  Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[3:33:14.400 --> 3:33:22.400]  Aaron Dykes has conservatively bought, through this office, and read over 50 books by Eugenicist and books about Eugenicist.
[3:33:22.400 --> 3:33:27.400]  This is the dominant culture in the Western world for over 100 years.
[3:33:27.400 --> 3:33:34.400]  And that's why when you're in newsstands, you see articles about the people bomb, and falling fertility, and how the West is dying,
[3:33:34.400 --> 3:33:40.400]  and how we're suddenly, you know, sterile and sperm counts dropping, and how wonderful it is.
[3:33:40.400 --> 3:33:48.400]  Like in this Economist this month, it says falling fertility, how the population problem is solving itself.
[3:33:48.400 --> 3:33:52.400]  Fertility is falling astonishingly fast, and that's bringing big benefits.
[3:33:52.400 --> 3:33:55.400]  Page 15.
[3:33:55.400 --> 3:34:00.400]  And then I turn to page 15, and I can read all about it.
[3:34:00.400 --> 3:34:02.400]  So you see their propaganda everywhere.
[3:34:02.400 --> 3:34:07.400]  Oh, the UN just said a month ago in Copenhagen.
[3:34:07.400 --> 3:34:14.400]  They said, we want a world tax on children and a tax on every can of tomato sauce you buy,
[3:34:14.400 --> 3:34:20.400]  everything with its energy ration, to shut off human activity to save the planet.
[3:34:20.400 --> 3:34:25.400]  Which is just as fraudulent as their man-made global warming, with record cold temperatures gripping the planet right now.
[3:34:25.400 --> 3:34:32.400]  You read Ecoscience by the White House Science, and the previous Science Advisor to George Bush Sr., Paul O'Earlick,
[3:34:32.400 --> 3:34:36.400]  the current John P. Holdren for Obama, the same crew.
[3:34:36.400 --> 3:34:44.400]  Literally hundreds and hundreds of books they've read, more than 50 the last few years since we made in-game that Aaron's been obsessed with reading.
[3:34:44.400 --> 3:34:47.400]  We're putting that knowledge into the new film we're working on.
[3:34:47.400 --> 3:34:54.400]  All of this going on, books by Bernard Shaw, George Bernard Shaw, where he endlessly said,
[3:34:54.400 --> 3:35:00.400]  we'll set up a world dictatorship, anyone with below a 90 IQ will be executed.
[3:35:00.400 --> 3:35:06.400]  We need a painless gas, so it's humane, killing you is humane, he says it's humane.
[3:35:06.400 --> 3:35:14.400]  He went and met with Hitler, Mussolini, he loved them, they were great, they were good, they were wonderful.
[3:35:14.400 --> 3:35:21.400]  And then after Hitler got exposed, that's why my dad, the botany professor at UT, was like, I'm Jewish,
[3:35:21.400 --> 3:35:23.400]  and Hitler only wanted to kill certain groups.
[3:35:23.400 --> 3:35:28.400]  The truth is, we have to reduce world population of all the bad people. Eugenics is good.
[3:35:28.400 --> 3:35:34.400]  See, and that's when I was taught in college, it was just, oh, you're here for a history class.
[3:35:34.400 --> 3:35:37.400]  There's too many people, whites are bad and be a white professor.
[3:35:37.400 --> 3:35:39.400]  And I was like, what is this?
[3:35:39.400 --> 3:35:47.400]  World government's good, then I'd go turn CNN on it and say, the Southern Poverty Law Center says there's dangerous people saying there's a world government.
[3:35:47.400 --> 3:35:55.400]  And I went in college, 20 years old, 19 years old, I went, wait a minute, they're telling me my guns are bad, white people are bad,
[3:35:55.400 --> 3:35:58.400]  world government's good, we need to reduce world population.
[3:35:58.400 --> 3:36:06.400]  But I turned CNN on, or I turned C-SPAN on, they're having congressional hearings about dangerous crazies that believe the government's doing this.
[3:36:06.400 --> 3:36:11.400]  So see, they propagandize, but then demonize so that mainline Americans never get involved.
[3:36:11.400 --> 3:36:17.400]  It's a thing of not making it kosher or palatable to talk about this.
[3:36:17.400 --> 3:36:22.400]  Now, I just happened to cross a video clip on YouTube last night.
[3:36:22.400 --> 3:36:29.400]  And I had already seen it here in the office in our research from the Soviet story, which is a powerful film.
[3:36:29.400 --> 3:36:39.400]  It won the Boston Film Festival, the Black Knights Film Festival, the Baltic Film Festival, the Sedona Film Festival, pretty big film.
[3:36:39.400 --> 3:36:51.400]  And it's the Soviet story and it completely exposes how the Soviets and the Nazis were the same, worked for the same people, all run by leftist eugenicists who worshiped Hitler.
[3:36:51.400 --> 3:36:55.400]  I mean, I have to see Margaret Stanger all the time in Newsweek and Time as a wonderful woman.
[3:36:55.400 --> 3:37:01.400]  She was Time Magazine of the Year, she was the 100 most important women in the last century in 2000.
[3:37:01.400 --> 3:37:06.400]  And they never tell you, she said, blacks are subhuman weeds that must be killed.
[3:37:06.400 --> 3:37:10.400]  We'll use the Rockefeller Foundation to hire black leaders to do it.
[3:37:10.400 --> 3:37:14.400]  W.D.B. Du Bois, all of them, or E.B. Du Bois, all of them.
[3:37:14.400 --> 3:37:17.400]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[3:37:17.400 --> 3:37:33.400]  We got three clips, some of it's really bad audio because it was filmed, you know, 80 years ago or more with him worshipping Mussolini, the worshipping of Hitler, the quotes that we've got out of his book about nerve-gassing.
[3:37:33.400 --> 3:37:39.400]  Now, this, when you read the Wikipedia about him, this is the great liberal.
[3:37:39.400 --> 3:37:58.400]  He was, he's worshipped as one of the greatest liberals ever just two weeks ago. We had the video clip of MSNBC of one of the supporters of George Bernard Shaw, who promotes FEMA camps and mass arrest and Soviet reeducation.
[3:37:58.400 --> 3:38:01.400]  And he's called the communist communist.
[3:38:01.400 --> 3:38:06.400]  And he saw Olenski, who pledged his book to Lucifer, the original radical.
[3:38:06.400 --> 3:38:15.400]  He was a big supporter of Shaw. And here is Chris Matthews saying this is his idol.
[3:38:15.400 --> 3:38:24.400]  But then Chris Matthews, if he was sitting here before me, I guarantee you wouldn't laugh at me if I talked about communism.
[3:38:24.400 --> 3:38:29.400]  But see, he really knows it's a joke. He, it's like I'm a child. He goes, that's off limits. That doesn't exist.
[3:38:29.400 --> 3:38:32.400]  Yes, I praise communist leaders, but it doesn't exist.
[3:38:32.400 --> 3:38:35.400]  Yes, there's a world government, but you are so stupid, you're not even allowed to resist it.
[3:38:35.400 --> 3:38:39.400]  So we've got a lot of his quotes, got some video clips coming up, Aaron.
[3:38:39.400 --> 3:38:44.400]  But from your research of these people, what is the guiding principle of the left and right?
[3:38:44.400 --> 3:38:46.400]  What is their real secret religion?
[3:38:46.400 --> 3:38:49.400]  They all publish it, but think we're so dumb, we don't read it.
[3:38:49.400 --> 3:38:51.400]  And who is George Bernard Shaw?
[3:38:51.400 --> 3:38:55.400]  George Bernard Shaw believes in eugenics as a religion.
[3:38:55.400 --> 3:38:59.400]  There's a quote with those words, just as Francis Galton said the same thing.
[3:38:59.400 --> 3:39:07.400]  And the shocking thing for me that I didn't know before I started working here was that all the stuff the Nazis did was from, you know,
[3:39:07.400 --> 3:39:11.400]  England and the United States through all these eugenics before that.
[3:39:11.400 --> 3:39:15.400]  And it just fits right in with the whole socialism and collectivism thing.
[3:39:15.400 --> 3:39:20.400]  They want to control everything from birth to everything you're allowed to eat and have.
[3:39:20.400 --> 3:39:22.400]  They want to control all of society.
[3:39:22.400 --> 3:39:26.400]  This is a religion of chicken neck pervert control freaks.
[3:39:26.400 --> 3:39:30.400]  They're always perverts. They're always control freaks.
[3:39:30.400 --> 3:39:32.400]  And all they talk about is killing people.
[3:39:32.400 --> 3:39:39.400]  But Bernard Shaw personally, when he was growing up, identified with Mephistopheles from Faust, which is the devil character.
[3:39:39.400 --> 3:39:42.400]  He believed he looked like him and he praised Nietzsche.
[3:39:42.400 --> 3:39:44.400]  He was obsessed with Nietzsche's Superman character.
[3:39:44.400 --> 3:39:45.400]  And he liked Lenin.
[3:39:45.400 --> 3:39:48.400]  And Lenin thought he was the devil and tried to do his beard like the devil.
[3:39:48.400 --> 3:39:52.400]  I mean, they're devils. They're psychopaths that get your government and kill you.
[3:39:52.400 --> 3:39:59.400]  And they believe in every form and fashion that they're the elite class and that the rest of us are expendable and should be eliminated.
[3:39:59.400 --> 3:40:03.400]  But really, we're just not psychopath control freaks craving power like them.
[3:40:03.400 --> 3:40:05.400]  Oh, yeah, they want the power.
[3:40:05.400 --> 3:40:07.400]  I mean, these people are terrible.
[3:40:07.400 --> 3:40:11.400]  But see, that's the point I made in an earlier hour is that if you look at the Aztecs,
[3:40:11.400 --> 3:40:15.400]  if you look at the Mayans, if you look at the Germanic and Druidic tribes of Europe,
[3:40:15.400 --> 3:40:19.400]  if you look at the Romans, if you look at the Greeks, that's not popularly taught,
[3:40:19.400 --> 3:40:21.400]  but many Greek tribes had human sacrifice.
[3:40:21.400 --> 3:40:26.400]  If you look at the Babylonians, the Egyptians, every culture, the ancient Chinese,
[3:40:26.400 --> 3:40:31.400]  they all had human sacrifice and the priest class would demand the best looking maiden.
[3:40:31.400 --> 3:40:35.400]  A lot of times they would demand the prince or even the king.
[3:40:35.400 --> 3:40:39.400]  They would and they would use a drought or a crisis to say, see, give me more power.
[3:40:39.400 --> 3:40:48.400]  In fact, we see the worst periods in all these different societies going back over 8000 years when there's bad droughts or floods,
[3:40:48.400 --> 3:40:53.400]  because the priest class can then scare everybody and say the volcano god is mad.
[3:40:53.400 --> 3:40:55.400]  Look at the Polynesians.
[3:40:55.400 --> 3:41:02.400]  Look at the Hawaiians throwing one of the daughters of the king into Pele.
[3:41:02.400 --> 3:41:05.400]  Again, it's a primitive 1% of the population,
[3:41:05.400 --> 3:41:11.400]  conservatively sociologists and psychologists have studied it, on average 1% are psychopaths
[3:41:11.400 --> 3:41:13.400]  and they don't just not have feelings.
[3:41:13.400 --> 3:41:14.400]  They're statistic psychopaths.
[3:41:14.400 --> 3:41:15.400]  They enjoy pain.
[3:41:15.400 --> 3:41:20.400]  And through thousands of years, they are always going to end up getting in control.
[3:41:20.400 --> 3:41:22.400]  You may have some good governments, but they're rare.
[3:41:22.400 --> 3:41:26.400]  And once they get into control, they go hog wild mad.
[3:41:26.400 --> 3:41:29.400]  And again, they always demand children.
[3:41:29.400 --> 3:41:31.400]  They like to torture innocent children.
[3:41:31.400 --> 3:41:32.400]  That's the funnest thing.
[3:41:32.400 --> 3:41:34.400]  And they got to give them to Quetzkotlapodl.
[3:41:34.400 --> 3:41:36.400]  They've got to give them to Chokmul.
[3:41:36.400 --> 3:41:39.400]  They've got to give them to Salwin.
[3:41:39.400 --> 3:41:43.400]  They've got to give them to Morduk.
[3:41:43.400 --> 3:41:45.400]  They've got to give it to Astoroth.
[3:41:45.400 --> 3:41:47.400]  They've got to give it to Beelzebub.
[3:41:47.400 --> 3:41:49.400]  They've got to give it to Horus.
[3:41:49.400 --> 3:41:52.400]  They've got to give it to Moloch.
[3:41:52.400 --> 3:41:55.400]  They've got to get, I mean, and again, I want to explain this.
[3:41:55.400 --> 3:41:58.400]  The reason these different than the globalist divide and conquer,
[3:41:58.400 --> 3:42:06.400]  the reason they obsess in divide and conquer on always having a myth of only the Catholics are evil.
[3:42:06.400 --> 3:42:11.400]  Are only the Jews are evil and all evil flows are only white man is evil.
[3:42:11.400 --> 3:42:13.400]  Are only black men are evil.
[3:42:13.400 --> 3:42:18.400]  They've got the mark of cane on them and so they deserve to be slaves.
[3:42:18.400 --> 3:42:23.400]  500 years ago with the start of the transatlantic slave trade into the Americas,
[3:42:23.400 --> 3:42:27.400]  it's always an excuse to dehumanize a group.
[3:42:27.400 --> 3:42:32.400]  And so then people can't recognize the evil of their own organization
[3:42:32.400 --> 3:42:34.400]  because it's only that outside group that's evil.
[3:42:34.400 --> 3:42:37.400]  The Jews, they say, are inherently the seed of the devil.
[3:42:37.400 --> 3:42:39.400]  The blacks are inherently the seed of the devil.
[3:42:39.400 --> 3:42:44.400]  The white man is inherently that every group, the black groups, the royal Israelite groups,
[3:42:44.400 --> 3:42:47.400]  they believe all the whites and Jews of the devil.
[3:42:47.400 --> 3:42:49.400]  And then the other groups believe the blacks are the devil.
[3:42:49.400 --> 3:42:53.400]  And then, and of course, you've got psychopaths that are Jewish groups,
[3:42:53.400 --> 3:42:55.400]  psychopaths that are feeding on their own people,
[3:42:55.400 --> 3:42:57.400]  getting them to go into their control through the outside threat.
[3:42:57.400 --> 3:43:00.400]  We have the Zionist documents where they like their people to get persecuted.
[3:43:00.400 --> 3:43:02.400]  They have to, they finance groups to do it.
[3:43:02.400 --> 3:43:07.400]  The bomb Jewish, this is declassified by the British and the Jews in Israel,
[3:43:07.400 --> 3:43:11.400]  that they would bomb the ancient Jewish communities in Iran
[3:43:11.400 --> 3:43:15.400]  and the ancient communities in Syria and the ancient communities in Spain
[3:43:15.400 --> 3:43:18.400]  and the ancient communities in Iraq to make them go to Israel.
[3:43:18.400 --> 3:43:23.400]  They would pay Hitler to not let the Jews leave anywhere but to Israel
[3:43:23.400 --> 3:43:25.400]  and then to pay the Zionist money to get out,
[3:43:25.400 --> 3:43:29.400]  that there have been major university publications written by Jews about that.
[3:43:29.400 --> 3:43:30.400]  That's a microcosm.
[3:43:30.400 --> 3:43:35.400]  The obsessing on Jews is that by only saying Jews are one other group,
[3:43:35.400 --> 3:43:37.400]  but that's a good example, are evil,
[3:43:37.400 --> 3:43:41.400]  then you can't recognize the inherent psychopaths in your own group.
[3:43:41.400 --> 3:43:43.400]  It allows the elites to divide and conquer,
[3:43:43.400 --> 3:43:48.400]  but it also allows the psycho groups over the Catholics, over the Jews,
[3:43:48.400 --> 3:43:50.400]  over the Protestants, over the military.
[3:43:50.400 --> 3:43:53.400]  It's all cults, brainwashing, marching, sleep deprivation,
[3:43:53.400 --> 3:43:58.400]  shaved heads, identity, flags, colors, groups, gangs, cults.
[3:43:58.400 --> 3:44:00.400]  Everything is ancient mind control,
[3:44:00.400 --> 3:44:04.400]  and that's why they order you-must-body scan as an act of supplication,
[3:44:04.400 --> 3:44:05.400]  of submission.
[3:44:05.400 --> 3:44:06.400]  You must take your shoes off.
[3:44:06.400 --> 3:44:07.400]  You must answer questions.
[3:44:07.400 --> 3:44:09.400]  It's all about submission.
[3:44:09.400 --> 3:44:14.400]  And so, again, you have psychopaths of all these major groups.
[3:44:14.400 --> 3:44:17.400]  Instead of just saying, oh, the leadership of Germany,
[3:44:17.400 --> 3:44:19.400]  or the leadership of China, or the leadership of Israel,
[3:44:19.400 --> 3:44:23.400]  or the leadership of Iran is evil, no, that group becomes evil,
[3:44:23.400 --> 3:44:25.400]  then we never recognize the truth.
[3:44:25.400 --> 3:44:30.400]  It is a 1% psychopath guild that have developed systems of con artistry
[3:44:30.400 --> 3:44:34.400]  and manipulation to build a planet where they can carry out their operations.
[3:44:34.400 --> 3:44:35.400]  Aaron Dykes.
[3:44:35.400 --> 3:44:36.400]  I agree, too.
[3:44:36.400 --> 3:44:39.400]  I think the riddle of the racism is that the only group they really respect
[3:44:39.400 --> 3:44:43.400]  is their own aristocracy, but really only the ones who are willing to take control
[3:44:43.400 --> 3:44:46.400]  and, you know, quote, do what must be done for the...
[3:44:46.400 --> 3:44:48.400]  Do what must be done, Lord Vader.
[3:44:48.400 --> 3:44:49.400]  Kill the younglings.
[3:44:49.400 --> 3:44:52.400]  You must kill the innocent to prove you're a psycho.
[3:44:52.400 --> 3:44:56.400]  And the priest class always demands children and women be killed
[3:44:56.400 --> 3:44:59.400]  as an act of total submission.
[3:44:59.400 --> 3:45:04.400]  Yeah, and they want to eliminate the race so the Superman race can rise,
[3:45:04.400 --> 3:45:08.400]  but really they all have fatal flaws and they're evil, wicked people.
[3:45:08.400 --> 3:45:13.400]  All of these elitists who don't end up getting killed or executed die.
[3:45:13.400 --> 3:45:15.400]  I don't even want to say how they all end up.
[3:45:15.400 --> 3:45:19.400]  Eating their own excrement, crazy, thinking they're God,
[3:45:19.400 --> 3:45:23.400]  it's admitted that Lenin would go to a little island he had
[3:45:23.400 --> 3:45:24.400]  with thousands of white rabbits.
[3:45:24.400 --> 3:45:26.400]  They ended up putting that in a Hollywood movie separately
[3:45:26.400 --> 3:45:29.400]  where the crazy guy pops the bag of the car and throws out the rabbits
[3:45:29.400 --> 3:45:31.400]  and is running around shooting them with a shotgun
[3:45:31.400 --> 3:45:33.400]  and he would just run around stabbing them and killing them
[3:45:33.400 --> 3:45:36.400]  and shooting them and just flopping around and he would order them
[3:45:36.400 --> 3:45:39.400]  more blood, more death, that we have that in a clip coming up.
[3:45:39.400 --> 3:45:43.400]  Yeah, I think Franco and Spain like to hunt an entire field of quail
[3:45:43.400 --> 3:45:47.400]  and wouldn't... he wasn't satisfied till there's thousands of them.
[3:45:47.400 --> 3:45:48.400]  He didn't even like to eat them.
[3:45:48.400 --> 3:45:49.400]  He just liked to kill.
[3:45:49.400 --> 3:45:51.400]  He would have others help him kill.
[3:45:51.400 --> 3:45:53.400]  It's, um, I guess it's something they do.
[3:45:53.400 --> 3:45:54.400]  I don't know.
[3:45:54.400 --> 3:45:56.400]  I'm going to have you back in. I get in here and start ranting.
[3:45:56.400 --> 3:45:57.400]  I want to give people all the data.
[3:45:57.400 --> 3:46:01.400]  But think about every human culture turns into human sacrifice,
[3:46:01.400 --> 3:46:02.400]  enslavement and war.
[3:46:02.400 --> 3:46:07.400]  It's an act of utter submission because psychopaths like the same thing,
[3:46:07.400 --> 3:46:10.400]  whether it's Ted Bundy or whether it was, you know,
[3:46:10.400 --> 3:46:12.400]  the king of the Aztecs, Montezuma.
[3:46:12.400 --> 3:46:14.400]  It's the same deal.
[3:46:14.400 --> 3:46:16.400]  Let's play this Mussolini worshiping clip.
[3:46:16.400 --> 3:46:20.400]  Here he is worshiping Mussolini, the head liberal that they all worship,
[3:46:20.400 --> 3:46:21.400]  George Bernard Shaw.
[3:46:21.400 --> 3:46:27.400]  The other thing I, uh, for instance...
[3:46:27.400 --> 3:46:32.400]  Now that is, uh, that is what I call my Mussolini study.
[3:46:32.400 --> 3:46:38.400]  They, uh, by the way, I think injustice to senior Mussolini,
[3:46:38.400 --> 3:46:43.400]  I ought to tell you that he has a very, very wonderful head.
[3:46:43.400 --> 3:46:48.400]  He has a wonderful brow which comes down to here.
[3:46:48.400 --> 3:46:52.400]  But the difficulty is that he can't take it off.
[3:46:52.400 --> 3:46:59.400]  Now, if you watch me, I can put on that imposing look
[3:46:59.400 --> 3:47:06.400]  that terrifies the Mussolini look.
[3:47:06.400 --> 3:47:08.400]  How does that work?
[3:47:08.400 --> 3:47:10.400]  He does the fascist salute.
[3:47:10.400 --> 3:47:12.400]  I can take it off.
[3:47:12.400 --> 3:47:15.400]  Now senior Mussolini cannot take it off.
[3:47:15.400 --> 3:47:19.400]  He has condemned, although he is a most amiable man,
[3:47:19.400 --> 3:47:25.400]  he has condemned to go through life with that terrible and imposing expression
[3:47:25.400 --> 3:47:30.400]  which really does a great deal of injustice to his kindly nature.
[3:47:30.400 --> 3:47:33.400]  But I, I can put it on and I can take it off.
[3:47:33.400 --> 3:47:35.400]  He goes on to say how great Mussolini is.
[3:47:35.400 --> 3:47:38.400]  And in his writings, he praised Hitler, he praised Mussolini,
[3:47:38.400 --> 3:47:41.400]  and he believed, we're going to play that clip coming up,
[3:47:41.400 --> 3:47:43.400]  that everyone should be nerve-gassed.
[3:47:43.400 --> 3:47:44.400]  Go ahead and read some quotes.
[3:47:44.400 --> 3:47:46.400]  Yeah, it's kind of, there's a riddle in there
[3:47:46.400 --> 3:47:49.400]  because he calls Mussolini kindly and amiable.
[3:47:49.400 --> 3:47:51.400]  It's in his quotes too.
[3:47:51.400 --> 3:47:54.400]  If under socialism, you would not be allowed to be poor.
[3:47:54.400 --> 3:47:58.400]  You would be forcibly fed, clothed, lodged, taught, and employed,
[3:47:58.400 --> 3:48:00.400]  whether you like it or not.
[3:48:00.400 --> 3:48:03.400]  And if it were discovered that you had not the character and industry
[3:48:03.400 --> 3:48:05.400]  enough to be worth all this trouble,
[3:48:05.400 --> 3:48:08.400]  you might be possibly executed in a kindly manner.
[3:48:08.400 --> 3:48:10.400]  And see, once you're in a socialist system,
[3:48:10.400 --> 3:48:13.400]  oh, we've got to kill people because they're not pulling their way.
[3:48:13.400 --> 3:48:16.400]  And he calls for the humane gas.
[3:48:16.400 --> 3:48:22.400]  It's a death that's instant and painless, but it's death nonetheless.
[3:48:22.400 --> 3:48:24.400]  That's the nature of the quotes that he puts forward.
[3:48:24.400 --> 3:48:27.400]  And you find H.G. Wells says the same kind of thing.
[3:48:27.400 --> 3:48:32.400]  And that's what they did in Nazi Germany and under communism.
[3:48:32.400 --> 3:48:34.400]  Let's go to the next clip in fluoride in the water.
[3:48:34.400 --> 3:48:35.400]  The Soviets started that.
[3:48:35.400 --> 3:48:36.400]  Let's go to the next clip.
[3:48:36.400 --> 3:48:37.400]  The first part's in German.
[3:48:37.400 --> 3:48:42.400]  Then it's Shaw talking how great about eugenics and control is.
[3:48:42.400 --> 3:48:45.400]  In fact, Aaron, tell us about this clip coming up.
[3:48:45.400 --> 3:48:47.400]  Yeah, it's the same kind of thing.
[3:48:47.400 --> 3:48:52.400]  It's how he wants to forcibly execute people who are not deemed worthwhile to live.
[3:48:52.400 --> 3:48:54.400]  It is eugenics, but it's also socialism.
[3:48:54.400 --> 3:48:56.400]  And now the cover of Newsweek, the case for killing Granny.
[3:48:56.400 --> 3:48:57.400]  Here it is.
[3:49:03.400 --> 3:49:05.400]  Why killing is essential?
[3:49:05.400 --> 3:49:14.400]  It first appeared in January, 1849, in Marx's journal, Neuer Reinscher Zeitung.
[3:49:14.400 --> 3:49:24.400]  Engels wrote of how the class war in Marx in terms means that when socialist revolution happens,
[3:49:24.400 --> 3:49:33.400]  the class war happens, there will be primitive societies in Europe, two stages behind,
[3:49:33.400 --> 3:49:36.400]  because they're not even capitalist yet.
[3:49:36.400 --> 3:49:44.400]  And he had in mind the Basques, and the Bretons, and the Scottish Highlanders, and the Serbs,
[3:49:44.400 --> 3:49:49.400]  and he calls them racial trash.
[3:49:49.400 --> 3:49:53.400]  They're upfeller, racial trash.
[3:49:53.400 --> 3:50:00.400]  And they will have to be destroyed because being two stages behind in historical struggle,
[3:50:00.400 --> 3:50:03.400]  it will be impossible to bring them up.
[3:50:03.400 --> 3:50:06.400]  See, Marx and Engels both wrote, and this would be in British newspapers,
[3:50:06.400 --> 3:50:11.400]  we're going to kill the Scots, we're going to kill the Serbs, and notice who they attack, the Serbs.
[3:50:11.400 --> 3:50:16.400]  Anyone who wants to be rural and just a regular human, you must be killed,
[3:50:16.400 --> 3:50:18.400]  because you can't be part of the scientific dictatorship.
[3:50:18.400 --> 3:50:23.400]  And then Russell comes up, they cut back to a clip of him saying, do that.
[3:50:23.400 --> 3:50:25.400]  I couldn't agree more.
[3:50:25.400 --> 3:50:26.400]  It's very shocking.
[3:50:26.400 --> 3:50:29.400]  Bertrand Russell said the same stuff, George Bernard Shaw, all of them.
[3:50:29.400 --> 3:50:36.400]  See, the thing with British Fabian socialism is they believe specifically in the long-term incremental socialism
[3:50:36.400 --> 3:50:41.400]  and to hide the true nature of socialism from the people who believed it was for the common good.
[3:50:41.400 --> 3:50:47.400]  And you see other founders like Webb, the Webb parents,
[3:50:47.400 --> 3:50:53.400]  they went to Russia and came back, it was said, as the Ten Commandments they had in their hands.
[3:50:53.400 --> 3:50:57.400]  They loved what was being done over there, they just knew they couldn't do it as quickly.
[3:50:57.400 --> 3:51:02.400]  They want to line you up and kill you and then take your daughters and sons and rape them as they slit their throats.
[3:51:02.400 --> 3:51:08.400]  Alex Jones, did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[3:51:08.400 --> 3:51:13.400]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[3:51:13.400 --> 3:51:17.400]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country,
[3:51:17.400 --> 3:51:19.400]  and it's possible that could even happen again.
[3:51:19.400 --> 3:51:24.400]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[3:51:24.400 --> 3:51:31.400]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[3:51:31.400 --> 3:51:35.400]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[3:51:35.400 --> 3:51:39.400]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[3:51:39.400 --> 3:51:42.400]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[3:51:42.400 --> 3:51:49.400]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[3:51:49.400 --> 3:51:58.400]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[3:51:58.400 --> 3:52:01.400]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[3:52:01.400 --> 3:52:06.400]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:52:06.400 --> 3:52:10.400]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:52:10.400 --> 3:52:15.400]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[3:52:15.400 --> 3:52:21.400]  They've turned tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[3:52:21.400 --> 3:52:26.400]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:52:26.400 --> 3:52:32.400]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel,
[3:52:32.400 --> 3:52:36.400]  hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:52:36.400 --> 3:52:43.400]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[3:52:43.400 --> 3:52:50.400]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[3:52:50.400 --> 3:52:55.400]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.

[3:54:01.400 --> 3:54:07.400]  Most part of the socialist went to became advocates of Hitler.
[3:54:07.400 --> 3:54:14.400]  The popular British playwright Bernard Shaw supported Hitler in the mass media.
[3:54:14.400 --> 3:54:20.400]  The left supported Hitler not because he deceived them. They knew Hitler would kill.
[3:54:20.400 --> 3:54:27.400]  He said he would. In fact, it was why they supported him.
[3:54:27.400 --> 3:54:32.400]  You must all know half a dozen people at least, who are no use in this world.
[3:54:32.400 --> 3:54:38.400]  Who are more trouble than they are worth. Just put them there and say, serve, or matter.
[3:54:38.400 --> 3:54:41.400]  Now will you be kind enough to justify your existence?
[3:54:41.400 --> 3:54:47.400]  If you can't justify your existence, if you're not pulling your weight in the social growth,
[3:54:47.400 --> 3:54:54.400]  if you're not producing as much as you consume, or perhaps a little more, then, clearly,
[3:54:54.400 --> 3:55:01.400]  we cannot use the big organization of our society for the purpose of keeping you alive,
[3:55:01.400 --> 3:55:06.400]  because your life does not benefit us, and it can't be of any much use to yourself.
[3:55:11.400 --> 3:55:16.400]  We got a bunch of other clips. We didn't even get to the worst ones, where he talks about the nerve gas.
[3:55:16.400 --> 3:55:22.400]  Maybe not the clip. There's another clip there where he talks about nerve gasing people.
[3:55:22.400 --> 3:55:25.400]  In fact, you have the nerve gas clip. Read it.
[3:55:25.400 --> 3:55:34.400]  Shaw in 1933, an appeal to the chemist to discover a humane gas that will kill instantly and painlessly,
[3:55:34.400 --> 3:55:37.400]  deadly by all means, but humane, not cruel.
[3:55:37.400 --> 3:55:41.400]  Yeah, that's the clip we've got. It's all in this film, the Soviet story.
[3:55:41.400 --> 3:55:50.400]  I mean, it's the film clips of him saying, and then the Nazi quotes about what a great idea it was.
[3:55:50.400 --> 3:55:54.400]  I mean, this is a guy who loved Hitler, and he's loved by the left.
[3:55:54.400 --> 3:55:59.400]  I have been in college, and I have seen leftists, before I even knew who he was,
[3:55:59.400 --> 3:56:02.400]  walk up just to see if you're one of the fellow travelers, and they go,
[3:56:02.400 --> 3:56:06.400]  do you know George Bernard Shaw, the genius? No, I don't.
[3:56:06.400 --> 3:56:08.400]  They go, hmm, like, oh, you're not one of us.
[3:56:08.400 --> 3:56:11.400]  And they just sit around in rooms going, we're going to kill everyone.
[3:56:11.400 --> 3:56:13.400]  We're going to kill everyone. It's for the earth.
[3:56:13.400 --> 3:56:16.400]  And they just get off on the idea that they're killing everyone,
[3:56:16.400 --> 3:56:19.400]  and they're going to decide if you can even be in a work camp.
[3:56:19.400 --> 3:56:22.400]  And if you can't, I'm sorry, you've got to die.
[3:56:22.400 --> 3:56:25.400]  And then you see Chris Matthews praising these people.
[3:56:25.400 --> 3:56:29.400]  That's a coded message to everyone when he talks about how he likes these people.
[3:56:29.400 --> 3:56:32.400]  He's not a liberal at all. He doesn't love you.
[3:56:32.400 --> 3:56:35.400]  He rules you. He bankrupts you.
[3:56:35.400 --> 3:56:40.400]  He's a man who works for the bankers. These are savage people who know what they're doing,
[3:56:40.400 --> 3:56:44.400]  but they're liberals. You just, oh, you're liberal. I love you.
[3:56:44.400 --> 3:56:46.400]  I mean, it's just Aaron.
[3:56:46.400 --> 3:56:52.400]  Yeah, I mean, all I could say is his quote from 1904 that nothing but a eugenic religion
[3:56:52.400 --> 3:56:57.400]  could save our civilization from the fate overtaken by all previous civilizations.
[3:56:57.400 --> 3:57:00.400]  He loves communism and all the rest of it.
[3:57:00.400 --> 3:57:05.400]  He says communism, fascism, just kill everybody. Just slaughter.
[3:57:05.400 --> 3:57:06.400]  No.
[3:57:06.400 --> 3:57:08.400]  And now they're drugging our water. They're drugging our kids.
[3:57:08.400 --> 3:57:11.400]  They're drugging us. They're naked body scanning us.
[3:57:11.400 --> 3:57:13.400]  They are just raping us on all cylinders.
[3:57:13.400 --> 3:57:18.400]  I mean, literally like every other culture was crazy kings and priests
[3:57:18.400 --> 3:57:21.400]  going, bring me your children to the fire pit.
[3:57:21.400 --> 3:57:24.400]  Every culture demanded children in death and murder
[3:57:24.400 --> 3:57:27.400]  because psychopaths have the same mindset.
[3:57:27.400 --> 3:57:31.400]  Did the Catholic church or Jews, the two favorite groups, everybody demonizes?
[3:57:31.400 --> 3:57:36.400]  Did they make the Aztec sacrifice? Did they make the Romans have the gladiators?
[3:57:36.400 --> 3:57:37.400]  No.
[3:57:37.400 --> 3:57:39.400]  Ancient Jews sacrificed people.
[3:57:39.400 --> 3:57:42.400]  Every culture does it. They all have psychopaths.
[3:57:42.400 --> 3:57:48.400]  And so I'm fighting German and Chinese and Jewish and Catholic psychopaths.
[3:57:48.400 --> 3:57:50.400]  I'm fighting the elites of the planet.
[3:57:50.400 --> 3:57:53.400]  Psychopaths have gotten in control of every institution.
[3:57:53.400 --> 3:57:58.400]  And we need to start recognizing the psychopaths and taking them on and realizing how they operate.
[3:57:58.400 --> 3:57:59.400]  Aaron, do you agree with me?
[3:57:59.400 --> 3:58:03.400]  I do agree. I mean, that's why George Orwell, he was one of the Fabian socialists.
[3:58:03.400 --> 3:58:06.400]  He turned against them. He knew how bad it was.
[3:58:06.400 --> 3:58:09.400]  He knew they were for communism killing.
[3:58:09.400 --> 3:58:10.400]  And that's why they say...
[3:58:10.400 --> 3:58:12.400]  That's how he knew. We are the priests of power, Winston.
[3:58:12.400 --> 3:58:14.400]  We're just going to trample and be trampled on.
[3:58:14.400 --> 3:58:16.400]  We like to kill people, Winston.
[3:58:16.400 --> 3:58:20.400]  Don't you understand? And Winston goes, I see. Now I see it.
[3:58:20.400 --> 3:58:25.400]  You see, they say in 1984, the title was based on 1884, the year of Fabian socialism.
[3:58:25.400 --> 3:58:26.400]  Yes.
[3:58:26.400 --> 3:58:30.400]  Founded. And their insignia, their logo is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[3:58:30.400 --> 3:58:33.400]  And destroying society, destroying the language,
[3:58:33.400 --> 3:58:39.400]  which is a group who sets up a planet to carry out murder and slaughter for psychopaths run by Ted Bundy.
[3:58:39.400 --> 3:58:43.400]  Retransmission with Ron Paul starts now. Hitfullwars.com.
[3:58:43.400 --> 3:58:46.400]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[3:58:46.400 --> 3:58:50.400]  Great job, Aaron! Resist the murderers!
[3:59:16.400 --> 3:59:20.400]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[3:59:20.400 --> 3:59:23.400]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[3:59:23.400 --> 3:59:26.400]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:59:26.400 --> 3:59:30.400]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[3:59:30.400 --> 3:59:32.400]  How much will you need? We don't know.
[3:59:32.400 --> 3:59:34.400]  How much do you want? All you can get.
[3:59:34.400 --> 3:59:35.400]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:59:35.400 --> 3:59:38.400]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
