[00:00.000 --> 00:29.520]  Well, it's Tuesday, it's Tuesday, March 5th, 2019, and we're broadcasting worldwide a
[00:29.520 --> 00:34.440]  giant internet ban has now been launched and is now beginning. I warned people of this
[00:34.440 --> 00:40.120]  a long time ago. It has nothing to do with porn. The UK is moving to, quote, ban porn
[00:40.120 --> 00:45.120]  that's free coming up on April 1st. But it's really an April Fools joke on everybody. We'll
[00:45.120 --> 00:48.440]  talk about that after the break. But first, I wanted to get to this key report that was
[00:48.440 --> 00:53.760]  predicted by us. Russian Gate is a fraud. Now they move on to the rest of their scams.
[00:53.760 --> 01:00.000]  It's so hard on this witch hunt, this phony deal that they put together, this phony thing
[01:00.000 --> 01:06.000]  that now looks like it's dying so they don't have anything with Russia. There's no collusion.
[01:06.000 --> 01:11.920]  So now they go and morph into, let's inspect every deal he's ever done. A little shifty
[01:11.920 --> 01:20.040]  shift yesterday. It's the first time he went into a meeting and he said, we're going to
[01:20.040 --> 01:25.400]  look into his finance. I said, where did that come from? He always talked about Russia collusion
[01:25.400 --> 01:32.240]  with Russia, the collusion, delusion. And unfortunately, you put the wrong people in
[01:32.240 --> 01:38.080]  a couple of positions and they leave people for a long time that shouldn't be there. And
[01:38.080 --> 01:46.160]  all of a sudden, they're trying to take you out with bull. Okay, the rich hunt won't die.
[01:46.160 --> 01:51.880]  That is if House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler and Congressman Adam Schiff continue
[01:51.880 --> 01:57.920]  to fantasize regularly on national television about the impeachment of President Donald Trump.
[01:57.920 --> 02:02.840]  We are certainly looking deep into the set of issues around Moscow Trump Tower. We're
[02:02.840 --> 02:07.360]  also looking at persistent allegations that the Russians have been laundering money through
[02:07.360 --> 02:11.400]  the Trump Organization. I don't know that that's true. How about if Robert Mueller comes
[02:11.400 --> 02:17.200]  back and says definitively, we find no collusion by President Trump? Is that a conclusion you'll
[02:17.200 --> 02:23.880]  accept? Well, we'd want to see the evidence behind that and see the validity of that.
[02:23.880 --> 02:29.680]  We could agree or disagree. Jerry Nadler announced that he will submit over 60 document requests
[02:29.680 --> 02:34.400]  to the White House and the Justice Department in a bid to keep the witch hunt going as Mueller's
[02:34.400 --> 02:39.960]  expectantly disappointing investigation comes to a close. And after former Trump lawyer
[02:39.960 --> 02:45.440]  Michael Cohen's second round of embarrassing testimony served to allow Cohen to purge
[02:45.440 --> 02:51.120]  her himself yet again in front of Congress. Mr. Cohen, how long did you work in the White
[02:51.120 --> 02:55.880]  House? I never worked in the White House. That's the point, isn't it, Mr. Cohen? No, sir. Yes,
[02:55.880 --> 02:59.560]  it is. No, it's not, sir. You wanted to work in the White House. No, sir. You didn't get brought
[02:59.560 --> 03:07.200]  to the dance. Sir. Now, I was extremely proud to be personal attorney to the President of the
[03:07.200 --> 03:12.880]  United States of America. I did not want to go to the White House. Is there a chance that he'll
[03:12.880 --> 03:16.080]  ask me to go to Washington? Oh, there's absolutely a chance he's going to ask me to go. Oh, would
[03:16.080 --> 03:22.400]  you go? 100 percent. A lot of what he said today, I think, bolstered his credibility. I want you
[03:22.400 --> 03:28.280]  to count how many articles you see tomorrow about Schiff and Cummings prepping Cohen before he comes
[03:28.280 --> 03:35.520]  to Congress. You won't find a one. If he is such a confirmed liar, why didn't he say Trump told
[03:35.520 --> 03:42.600]  me the lie? If he had said it, Trump would there be subject to the possible charge of subordination
[03:42.600 --> 03:48.400]  of perjury, but he didn't say it. Of course, when it comes to the investigation of the Clinton's
[03:48.400 --> 03:54.920]  mountain of evidence detailing Russian collusion, blatant threats to national security, the financial
[03:54.920 --> 04:00.360]  rape of Haiti, and even Bill Clinton's sick affair in the Oval Office that led to impeachment,
[04:00.360 --> 04:06.800]  Jerry Nadler could be counted on to steer any investigation off course. Well, you cannot let
[04:06.800 --> 04:12.840]  the actions of people who want to bring the government to a halt and concentrate only on
[04:12.840 --> 04:18.040]  politics and only on obstruction affect everything else. It's a very good reason to have a Democratic
[04:18.040 --> 04:24.680]  House and Senate so we can get on with the government, with the business of the people instead of
[04:24.680 --> 04:28.760]  wasting our time on all kinds of investigations that will ultimately go nowhere. You look at the
[04:28.760 --> 04:33.400]  entire Clinton presidency, Bill Clinton presidency, white water, travel gate, this gate, that gate,
[04:33.400 --> 04:38.400]  nothing went anywhere until you got the Monica Lewinsky thing that didn't even exist at the time
[04:38.400 --> 04:43.640]  of the special prosecutor being appointed. They just kept persecuting him on thing after thing after
[04:43.640 --> 04:50.560]  thing. Just how far Schiff and Nadler will overreach to satisfy a handful of Trump critics in the
[04:50.560 --> 05:00.600]  face of millions of Americans will become apparent in the coming weeks and make no mistake. Well,
[05:00.600 --> 05:04.320]  I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners. This was going to be a
[05:04.320 --> 05:07.840]  big loss because we couldn't get the deep earth crystals anymore, 20 year and a half fight,
[05:07.840 --> 05:13.000]  but we have the original producer, the original crystal source, the best atomic iodine in the
[05:13.000 --> 05:17.920]  world, X2 is back. We got it. This deal just happened about a month ago. We rushed it into
[05:17.920 --> 05:22.440]  production. It's been bottled. The labels are being put on today and that it's going to be on an
[05:22.440 --> 05:28.440]  18 wheeler right here to Austin from the plant in the Rockies and it's going to be shipped out to
[05:28.440 --> 05:34.440]  you. Be sure and sign up for auto ship and an additional 10% off the 25% off celebration of the
[05:34.440 --> 05:39.120]  fact that we got it back and we're relaunching it. Research the iodine conspiracy. Find out why
[05:39.120 --> 05:43.480]  it's so important. Find out what the globalists don't want you to have the good halogens,
[05:43.480 --> 05:49.120]  you have the bad halogens at infowarstore.com. That's the umbrella site, infowarstore.com,
[05:49.120 --> 05:54.040]  makes you write the supplements and this is the King Daddy. Ladies and gentlemen,
[05:54.040 --> 06:14.120]  it is X2 original now back at infowarstore.com. Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide,
[06:14.120 --> 06:26.360]  it's Alex Jones. Well, here we are already Tuesday. It's amazing. Tuesday, March 5th,
[06:26.360 --> 06:34.200]  2019. I am your host Alex Jones here in the new studio. You've seen us do a lot of live reports
[06:34.200 --> 06:40.880]  and I had political coverage of big events like State of the Union here in our new State of the
[06:40.880 --> 06:45.800]  Art studio. We've got three night studios here now and are ready to start expanding to about 20
[06:45.800 --> 06:50.720]  hours a day live. We're about six months behind getting that done because of all the obvious
[06:50.720 --> 06:55.800]  globalist attempts to shut us down and block us. But we are moving forward thanks to your prayers
[06:55.800 --> 07:01.800]  and thanks to your support. And quite frankly, we are now reaching just as many people as we ever
[07:01.800 --> 07:07.800]  did after all the enemy's attempts to shut us down and shut us up. It has backfired,
[07:07.800 --> 07:13.800]  we achieve Streisand effect. And now we're reaching an even wider new audience thanks to this core
[07:13.800 --> 07:19.960]  audience of activists taking action. And I thought I'd celebrate the new studio today by
[07:19.960 --> 07:27.120]  wearing a Stetson open road cowboy hat, Silver Belly. This is the same hat my dad's dad wore his
[07:27.120 --> 07:33.760]  whole life that I knew him. And I got reminded that Paul Watson's here in town. And about,
[07:33.760 --> 07:38.200]  I was like 15 years ago that Paul has a whole different personality when you put a cowboy hat
[07:38.200 --> 07:45.160]  on him. And so we're going to put a cowboy hat on him and get his great Texas imitation, but
[07:45.160 --> 07:50.360]  also a lot of other serious issues when he joins us at the waypoint, at the midwaypoint halfway into
[07:50.360 --> 07:58.000]  the broadcast in about an hour and 23 minutes from now, Faith Goldie is also in on fire, exposing
[07:58.000 --> 08:02.080]  the controlled globalists inside the Republican Party, one of the final obstacles to really
[08:02.080 --> 08:06.760]  defeating the NWO. She's going to be popping in. And I tend to open the phones up as well. And
[08:06.760 --> 08:14.280]  then I will co host the war room with Owen shroyer three to six PM today, I will be on the
[08:14.280 --> 08:19.280]  second half with Paul Joseph Watson. And we're going to have open phones and on Reddit, ask us
[08:19.280 --> 08:25.000]  anything. I'm going to start a new system of ask me anything where you do it with two people, two
[08:25.000 --> 08:28.720]  different people. And you ask two different interesting people, questions, and they have a
[08:28.720 --> 08:32.720]  discussion. They ask each other questions. That's something I'm going to start. I'm going to start
[08:32.720 --> 08:37.920]  a podcast soon titled ask me anything where you have different guests on and you can ask them
[08:37.920 --> 08:43.720]  anything as well. So a lot of stuff about to happen here at info wars. Thanks to your prayers.
[08:43.720 --> 08:47.520]  Thanks to your support. Thanks to everything you do. And thanks to all the great AM and FM
[08:47.520 --> 08:52.920]  affiliates and TV affiliates as well. If you're listening to one of those, please be sure and
[08:52.920 --> 08:59.520]  spread the word about those fine stations and support them. Okay. You know, I talked about this a
[08:59.520 --> 09:06.120]  couple years ago when they passed the law. And they always pass draconian laws where they come into
[09:06.120 --> 09:13.320]  effect in a few years. Show that the public doesn't oppose them. People are very short sighted. They're
[09:13.320 --> 09:18.420]  thinking in the moment, not long term. But exactly as we said, they would do it. They've done it. And
[09:18.420 --> 09:22.160]  if you sit back and think, how would you take over the internet? How would you trick people to
[09:22.160 --> 09:28.120]  openly be surveilled? How would you trick people to be taxed to use the internet more than they even
[09:28.120 --> 09:35.760]  do in communist China? How would you do that? Well, when you saw porn hub and a couple of these
[09:35.760 --> 09:43.520]  other major sites, they get billions of views a month together at the heart of union meetings and
[09:43.520 --> 09:49.800]  and meetings with ICANN and meetings with big tech about how they were going to battle trafficking
[09:49.800 --> 09:57.200]  in humans and how they were going to empower women. You knew it was bad. So they signed on to ban
[09:57.200 --> 10:04.200]  free porn. Now, now their sites will still be a mix of paid and quote free. But but of course,
[10:04.200 --> 10:09.240]  if they've got more than half of the porn market, they want to be able to shut everybody else down.
[10:09.240 --> 10:14.240]  It's not about porn though. They know that it'll get conservatives and Christians on board. And
[10:14.240 --> 10:19.400]  just like the British government's the only government in the world that has a paid television
[10:19.400 --> 10:25.000]  tax. Even if you don't own a television, they tax you what is up to a thousand pounds a year. It's
[10:25.000 --> 10:30.880]  an outrageous amount of money and they even have vans that drive around because any receiver also
[10:30.880 --> 10:36.960]  transmits a tiny transmission. Any receiver is also a transceiver. So they have vans that drive
[10:36.960 --> 10:43.600]  around with people picking up if you're watching television, not just BBC, but television period.
[10:43.600 --> 10:49.880]  So there's a government tax to then fund propaganda. And that's what this is. So people
[10:49.880 --> 10:55.000]  think of the UK as such a free country. It's an outrageously unfree country. And so I'm going to
[10:55.000 --> 11:00.040]  break that down today and great detail. I apologize for watching on from the UK in studio to give
[11:00.040 --> 11:05.160]  a sys take on it. But you see the dredgerport.com headline, the headlines on info wars.com as well.
[11:05.160 --> 11:14.400]  UK blocks all porn that's free or free porn blocked free porn blocked in the UK. You go to
[11:14.400 --> 11:24.600]  info wars.com. And we have the headline that the the national move in the UK to ban quote free porn
[11:24.600 --> 11:33.360]  is really an internet tax and internet tracking system. So this is it. This is the plan. And I
[11:33.360 --> 11:38.000]  told folks a couple years ago, when they were talking about it, that this is what's being
[11:38.000 --> 11:44.880]  implemented. But it's sold as just Oh, you pay the government. And then they put software on
[11:44.880 --> 11:49.760]  your computer that watches what you do and you give them your ID or passport. And now you can go
[11:49.760 --> 11:54.880]  look at any porn you want. So I'm gonna say that again. The government is going to have a dossier
[11:54.880 --> 12:02.320]  they already do. But publicly, you're going to opt into a dossier that knows what porn you're
[12:02.320 --> 12:07.480]  watching. So you and your wife at Saturday night, you go in, you turn on the television to dial
[12:07.480 --> 12:14.640]  into the internet, and you pull up whatever your wife sent to. That's how it works. And now that
[12:14.640 --> 12:18.800]  you've got another partner in the bedroom with you, it's called the British government. But
[12:18.800 --> 12:24.280]  understand, it's coming here. This is the model. Everything done in China and England, and Europe
[12:24.280 --> 12:29.280]  is the model. And they even admit the articles are like, This is for to make sure children don't
[12:29.280 --> 12:34.080]  look at it. And this is to make sure we keep everybody safe. And this is to make sure we can
[12:34.080 --> 12:39.200]  stop people being exploited. All that's made up the UN's running the kidnapping rings, all of it.
[12:39.200 --> 12:42.480]  The porn industry, for anything you could say about it, I don't even defend it. It's very
[12:42.480 --> 12:48.160]  exploitive has has basically cleaned up its act under lawsuits and disease. And it's very exploitive
[12:48.160 --> 12:54.000]  and evil. And I'm not defending it. But any claims that the government of the UK or the US
[12:54.000 --> 12:58.320]  government or anybody trying to defend kids from porn is asinine. Because I've got stories right
[12:58.320 --> 13:05.520]  here in my stack, aggressive promotion of homosexuality. School stops LGBT lesson after
[13:05.520 --> 13:10.960]  backlash from angry angry parents being reported by the Daily Mail by RT and others. And you learn
[13:10.960 --> 13:14.880]  it's Muslim. So say what you want about Muslims, the throw gaze off buildings and cut women's
[13:14.880 --> 13:20.880]  genitals off. I disagree with that. I'm a libertarian. But I don't think you should have LGBT
[13:21.760 --> 13:26.720]  sexualizing kids. That's the pedophile side of that, which some groups are officially adopting
[13:26.720 --> 13:32.880]  the P now saying yes, we are a pedophilia. And so that was in the congressional report five years
[13:32.880 --> 13:37.280]  ago. The Democrats wanted all this. The same thing's happened in the UK. It's a unified,
[13:37.280 --> 13:42.480]  concerted effort. So they're sexualizing children. They've got drag kid things at school. They had
[13:42.480 --> 13:46.000]  drag queens coming and telling your five year old son that they're really a girl. I mean,
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.200]  if that happened at the park, you'd go to jail. If a man walked over at the park,
[13:49.200 --> 13:52.320]  while you're sitting there grilling hamburgers and said, I'm going to teach your daughter and
[13:52.320 --> 13:57.600]  your son about sex, they'd be arrested as being a pervert. But now it's done officially by the
[13:57.600 --> 14:02.720]  school. It's okay. So meanwhile, just today, you've got massive arrest of giant Islamic grooming
[14:02.720 --> 14:08.400]  gangs of little girls. And then you've got the leftist ally with radical Islam saying, come on
[14:08.400 --> 14:12.160]  in, do whatever you want. But now the Muslims are saying, Hey, I'm going to teach my five year old
[14:12.160 --> 14:17.440]  how to give a blow job. It's what they teach in UK schools or that he's going to put a dress on him.
[14:17.440 --> 14:22.800]  And so now the left saying it's okay. Muslims can opt out, but no one else can. And you'll
[14:22.800 --> 14:27.920]  be arrested if you're not a Muslim. So see, this is how the whole leftist system works, total
[14:27.920 --> 14:34.640]  and complete tyranny show when the UK quote blocks porn that is quote free. What they're saying is
[14:35.360 --> 14:41.520]  the tens of thousands of other sites, or now they're even going to go Puritan on you Puritanical
[14:41.520 --> 14:47.280]  and say even showing breast, soft core is now regulated. So now if you want to watch an R rated
[14:47.280 --> 14:50.880]  movie, you're going to have to opt into a government database and agree to be tracked. That's the
[14:50.880 --> 14:57.120]  secret of the global social credit score to get you to opt in. It's outrageous. So all the other
[14:57.120 --> 15:02.800]  sites can be shut down, all the other sites can be blocked and only the two big porn sites that
[15:02.800 --> 15:07.520]  account for half the porn visits in the world. Well, of course, they're for this porn hub and
[15:07.520 --> 15:13.920]  you porn. Now, now because this is much bigger than all the TV networks and all the media in the
[15:13.920 --> 15:20.240]  world combined, it's now going to be regulated and turned into one homogenized controlled
[15:20.240 --> 15:25.200]  combine, which is what it's always been about. That's what internet regulation is about. It's
[15:25.200 --> 15:29.920]  what the attacks on talk radio, the attacks on Alex Jones, the attacks on free speech, because
[15:29.920 --> 15:35.440]  once they can ban me, they can ban you. And once they can say, Oh, you have a government device
[15:35.440 --> 15:41.600]  and software, it watches what porn you're watching, and you pay a government license to go watch
[15:41.600 --> 15:47.600]  pornography from around the world. Think about that. That is so diabolical and so evil. That's
[15:47.600 --> 15:51.440]  the left doing in the name of protecting children when they're the ones that are a bunch of pedophilic
[15:51.440 --> 15:56.080]  perverts trying to get a hold of your kids and literally teach them how to be perverts. We'll
[15:56.080 --> 16:03.680]  be right back. Stay with us. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon you'll need a plan
[16:03.680 --> 16:09.680]  and place to survive. Forget bunkers. You're not a live underground gopher. You need survivalist

[17:32.320 --> 17:38.800]  is the empire of the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States
[17:38.800 --> 17:45.600]  of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken. Its former colony, the US,
[17:45.600 --> 17:51.920]  had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World
[17:51.920 --> 18:04.400]  War I, the United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.

[19:56.640 --> 20:05.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:05.440 --> 20:24.160]  Defending the Republic from enemies,
[20:24.160 --> 20:40.960]  foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[20:40.960 --> 20:54.880]  I didn't tell you I was going on Joe Rogan. We just snuck attack.
[20:55.920 --> 21:00.320]  And I can tell you there's a bunch of other sneak attacks coming very soon. Just as big
[21:00.880 --> 21:06.800]  or bigger. I talked to Joe this morning. It is undoubtedly with analytics the biggest podcast
[21:06.800 --> 21:12.320]  he's ever done. And the last one I did was number three. It was number one until Elon Musk and a
[21:12.320 --> 21:20.320]  few others. Now it's number one, only six days in. In fact, we're expecting by tomorrow night,
[21:20.320 --> 21:26.480]  it will have at least 30 million views between YouTube and iTunes. Right now, it's over 20
[21:26.480 --> 21:31.840]  million total. And that's with Google not letting it trend and blocking it. Remember that. Now,
[21:31.840 --> 21:46.160]  let me make the big announcement here. Okay. Internet ID, let me make the big announcement here.
[21:47.520 --> 21:58.240]  Internet ID, internet regulation, internet tracking is here. And it's being done under the
[21:58.240 --> 22:05.360]  auspice of, quote, blocking free porn. The UK has now passed law that has implemented
[22:06.320 --> 22:13.680]  April 1st that only the two big porn companies, porn hub and you porn will be the only sites you
[22:13.680 --> 22:19.680]  can visit. Everything else you've got to go through a government database, give them a passport or an
[22:19.680 --> 22:24.560]  ID, log into a government database so they can track what you do and then pay them money
[22:24.560 --> 22:31.360]  so that you have the right to go look at pornography. So just like George Arwell predicted,
[22:32.400 --> 22:40.080]  in 1984, the government is going to be in charge of pornography for control and debasement of the
[22:40.080 --> 22:45.760]  population. This has nothing to do with stopping pornography. It has nothing to do with stopping
[22:45.760 --> 22:51.200]  the targeting of children. It's mainstream media. It's cartoons. It's the public schools. It's all
[22:51.200 --> 22:59.280]  of them that are totally and completely obsessed with sexualizing children. And now that the government
[22:59.280 --> 23:05.600]  is going to be involved with all these fat checking groups and leftist groups like Hope
[23:05.600 --> 23:13.680]  Not Hate and the Southern Poverty Law Center and Media Matters, they're going to be in the history
[23:13.680 --> 23:19.360]  of the supposed porn you're visiting. And don't think this is just going to end in the UK. They
[23:19.360 --> 23:25.120]  admit with the major porn companies who want their competition shut down. This is total racketeering.
[23:25.120 --> 23:31.840]  This is total antitrust. They admit that they want their competition shut down. So they're
[23:31.840 --> 23:40.960]  partnering with government to control and track who looks at porn webcams, what movies you watch,
[23:40.960 --> 23:47.360]  what you do, and even soft core pornography will now be tracked in a government database. Think
[23:47.360 --> 23:52.320]  about how the IRS abused tens of thousands of Christians and conservatives and libertarians
[23:52.320 --> 23:58.160]  under Obama and no one got in trouble with Lawrence Lerner. Think about all the incredible abuses
[23:58.160 --> 24:04.160]  they've been involved with with the databases and leftist doxing people and using where you live
[24:04.160 --> 24:07.920]  and where you go to school and where you work to get you fired if you're a Trump supporter.
[24:09.040 --> 24:13.600]  And then imagine, you got to take your hat off to them to come up with something like this,
[24:13.600 --> 24:19.840]  that they would try to get away with this in 2019. And then just, oh, it's just a law to protect kids.
[24:21.360 --> 24:27.040]  You got to pay a government fee. You've got to then be tracked. And then the government,
[24:27.040 --> 24:34.160]  of course, can easily go in anytime they want. And they can add whatever disinformation they want
[24:34.160 --> 24:40.160]  to the database of supposed porn that you visited. Because in blackmail and control,
[24:40.160 --> 24:46.560]  people's sexual proclivity, people's sexual activity are their big dark secrets. And now the UK
[24:46.560 --> 24:52.000]  government, the kings of blackmail, the kings of pedophilia, the kings of using sex to control
[24:52.000 --> 24:57.680]  populations and governments are now saying, oh, by the way, you visit any major porn site.
[24:59.840 --> 25:03.360]  You've got to have a government license. You've got to give us your ID. You've got to be in a
[25:03.360 --> 25:08.160]  database. You've got to have our software on your computer that will have trusted groups like
[25:08.160 --> 25:13.760]  HopeNotHate and the Southern Poverty Law Center and others inside your computer. George Soros
[25:13.760 --> 25:20.000]  funded groups just like NewsGuard is now on all the Microsoft operating systems and browsers.
[25:20.560 --> 25:24.480]  And it's going to move on. They're saying the next few months to Apple and to Google
[25:24.480 --> 25:28.800]  and to Android and to the phones. And then now when you visit a site,
[25:29.680 --> 25:35.520]  it's not going to be on the site that, oh, don't listen to Alex Jones. Here's some fact-checking
[25:35.520 --> 25:38.960]  where they then misrepresent what we've said and done and then fact-check the straw man.
[25:38.960 --> 25:44.240]  No, it's on your phone. It's on your desktop. They're in your phone. You're in your desktop
[25:44.240 --> 25:48.480]  watching what you do in real time, telling you, oh, this is dangerous or oh, this is bad or,
[25:48.480 --> 25:52.240]  oh, you could have your credit score lowered. You could get in trouble. You're looking at
[25:52.240 --> 25:58.080]  illegal content. So it's multi-prompt. They've got the leftist fact-checkers and the universities
[25:58.080 --> 26:02.160]  and the intelligence agencies already plugged into Microsoft and looking at what you're saying
[26:02.160 --> 26:10.880]  and looking at what you're doing. And the neocons run NewsGuard. And then you've got over here,
[26:10.880 --> 26:16.800]  the left going, oh, no one wants to pay their BBC fee anymore of a thousand pounds a year or
[26:16.800 --> 26:23.840]  whatever it is. Look up what the BBC yearly charge is. Look that up for me real quick.
[26:23.840 --> 26:29.920]  Look up the BBC yearly charge for me because I want to get that looked at right now.
[26:29.920 --> 26:37.680]  I want to do that. So imagine they started this back in the 40s after World War II and they said,
[26:37.680 --> 26:41.760]  everybody that has a television, you've got to pay a tax. And then even if you didn't have a
[26:41.760 --> 26:44.960]  television, they said, well, you may be looking at your neighbor's TV. So you're going to pay
[26:44.960 --> 26:49.440]  this big giant tax. It used to be up to a thousand pounds, but now no one would pay it. So they lowered
[26:49.440 --> 26:56.720]  it to 147 to 150 pounds. So what is that? Two hundred and something dollars a year. But again,
[26:56.720 --> 27:00.720]  the key here isn't the money. It's with the internet. They can track what you're looking at
[27:00.720 --> 27:05.680]  and what you're doing. And they think the subservient, client population will accept it,
[27:05.680 --> 27:11.840]  but there's where it gets worse. Now it turns loose. The taxing authority, they have their IRS over
[27:11.840 --> 27:21.920]  there by another name, like their inland revenue inside the empire revenue. And now they're going
[27:21.920 --> 27:27.920]  to have an excuse to rage you to see that you were looking at porn that wasn't authorized and wasn't
[27:27.920 --> 27:31.600]  put through a government filter. I'm going to say it again. The government is going to run
[27:31.600 --> 27:36.400]  worldwide the production and the distribution because that's how this works. Once you take
[27:36.400 --> 27:40.000]  control of the regulatory power of something, you will then inevitably become the producer,
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.800]  the director. You will be the person making the money. So governments are now always horning in
[27:44.800 --> 27:49.760]  on Hollywood and the theater and entertainment and having a merger of that in any fascist or
[27:49.760 --> 27:56.080]  communist system. But now they'll be directly in control of pornography and the top pornography
[27:56.080 --> 28:02.000]  producers are all lined up as suitors to government because the internet decentralized porn and took
[28:02.000 --> 28:08.080]  the money out of it. All the way now to the only way you make money in porn if you read the
[28:08.080 --> 28:14.160]  expert analysis is individual to individual like prostitution, where women and men are doing webcams
[28:14.160 --> 28:20.400]  and giving people personal attention. So it's evolved or devolved now back to closer to real
[28:20.400 --> 28:27.120]  sex away from the big cookie cutter mass production of the 1960s and 1970s where there were porn
[28:27.120 --> 28:32.080]  movies making as much money as major Hollywood movies, tens of millions of dollars. That's all
[28:32.080 --> 28:38.080]  decentralized and destroyed. So now you have the perfect storm. Now you have the perfect storm
[28:38.080 --> 28:42.400]  of the big porn companies collapsing, government wanting to know what you're watching and doing,
[28:42.400 --> 28:47.520]  global government, internet ID, global social score coming together in England. The UK is the
[28:47.520 --> 28:52.800]  launch point for total surveillance of everything and it's coming here. Make no mistake when we

[31:59.840 --> 32:04.240]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there

[32:17.360 --> 32:22.400]  they're even better getting rid of what you said they were before. It's so much easier to burn video

[32:33.440 --> 32:38.640]  people know the truth and you can't be destroyed either. As long as you bind yourself to something
[32:38.640 --> 32:44.320]  and commit to it and go through the fire for it there is a magic that then takes place the transcend
[32:44.320 --> 32:49.040]  space and time. When you commit the word of mouth or to pray for us or to spread our articles and

[36:17.280 --> 36:23.120]  protect children from online smite yeah we don't want kids to be hateful bigots let's teach them
[36:23.120 --> 36:27.760]  to be sexualized at age five at least be called pedophilia now it's called liberal as early as
[36:27.760 --> 36:32.720]  next month porn sites will be required to get proof of id from uk residents before showing
[36:32.720 --> 36:38.560]  any x-rated clips includes free porn sites like porn hub and u porn who don't want there to be
[36:38.560 --> 36:43.360]  competition and want you to have to register which attract only two billion visits a month
[36:43.360 --> 36:47.360]  between them worldwide and no they're going to make a hundred times more money with the government
[36:47.360 --> 36:52.880]  who they lobby to do this that's right the big porn sites did this to create a monopoly those
[36:52.880 --> 36:58.080]  want a number of other sites and using age id system which requires users to verify their age
[36:58.080 --> 37:03.440]  via an official form of id which is his driver's license or passport so you're not getting into
[37:03.440 --> 37:08.240]  a hotel or passing a port you're going to go watch whatever and now the government's
[37:08.240 --> 37:12.240]  going to be there with a record of it from april when the new system is expected to launch
[37:12.960 --> 37:19.280]  randy internet lurkers will be shown a non pornographic landing page according to age id
[37:19.280 --> 37:27.120]  spokesman james clark when a user first visits a site protected by age id a landing page will
[37:27.680 --> 37:32.880]  appear with a prompt from the user to verify their age before they can access the site he told the
[37:32.880 --> 37:38.320]  metro each website will create their own non pornographic landing page when someone first
[37:38.320 --> 37:43.440]  clicks the site they'll be asked to register with age id to verify their age using a mobile
[37:43.440 --> 37:48.960]  sms m's credit card or passport or driver's license this is the internet id internet taxation
[37:48.960 --> 37:55.440]  internet regulation usually will then be able to use the age id username or password attached to
[37:55.440 --> 38:00.560]  your driver's license your passport the government has to access all porn sites that use age id although
[38:00.560 --> 38:06.000]  some may use different verification systems clark said it's a one-kind verification where they
[38:06.000 --> 38:12.160]  simple sign in for future access if a user verifies with the age id protected site they'll not need
[38:12.160 --> 38:17.840]  to perform the verification age or any other site carrying age id and again this is going to be
[38:17.840 --> 38:22.640]  used against everybody else to shut them down this is the global id folks the global internet
[38:22.640 --> 38:26.400]  id the holy grail of surveillance and control the new rules will approve as part of the digital
[38:26.400 --> 38:32.240]  economy act two years ago they aim to make it harder for under 18s to get a hold of adult material
[38:32.240 --> 38:37.120]  no that's going on the schools as well as registering with age id brits will also be able to access
[38:37.120 --> 38:43.200]  porn sites using a voucher you can buy from high street shops this is that nice thousands of shops
[38:43.200 --> 38:50.000]  will offer the special ids which users can link to an app known as portals and then it goes on to
[38:50.000 --> 38:55.440]  say you can also buy a government id and go through the government system so there you go and it's
[38:55.440 --> 39:00.720]  all tracked by the government so they got you to opt in like the government's not spying okay they are
[39:00.720 --> 39:05.120]  but you know what we just need you to opt in so we can do it because it's illegal to spy on you but
[39:05.120 --> 39:10.400]  now we're going going to do it openly and then meanwhile i mentioned this article earlier
[39:10.400 --> 39:16.080]  about their aggressive promotion of homosexuality called pedophilia when they target kids school
[39:16.080 --> 39:22.560]  stops lgbt lessons at their backlash from angry parents and when you read the articles in rt or
[39:22.560 --> 39:29.120]  the daily mail it's oh it's muslims they're upset that there's grown adults talking to their five
[39:29.120 --> 39:32.720]  year old sons and daughters about their sexual preference because kids aren't thinking about
[39:32.720 --> 39:37.440]  that i mean if a dad or mom started asking their five-year-old about have you heard about
[39:37.440 --> 39:42.960]  sadomasochism you heard about sex changes in children have you heard about fisting this is what
[39:42.960 --> 39:48.000]  they teach five-year-olds the kids are like what and you're just totally screwing them up i mean
[39:48.000 --> 39:54.000]  it's irrevocable pedophilic assault but it's all done by the leftist social engineers so it's all
[39:54.000 --> 40:01.280]  a okay and it continues school forced in lgbt lessons by outraged muslim parents so yeah the
[40:01.280 --> 40:05.520]  pedophiles are worse than even orthodox islam even though there's a lot of pedophilia in islam
[40:05.520 --> 40:13.120]  a primary school in birmingham england has halted lgbt lessons for 600 victims they call them pupils
[40:13.680 --> 40:18.560]  were reportedly taken out of class by furious muslim parents upset at homosexuals being
[40:18.560 --> 40:24.000]  aggressively taught to their children homosexuality barkville community school had been forced to
[40:24.000 --> 40:32.560]  suspend its no outsiders classes until easter while a consultation takes place with parents
[40:32.560 --> 40:36.960]  tensions between the school and parents has escalated due to a fight surrounding lgbt
[40:36.960 --> 40:44.720]  lifestyles being taught in classrooms the ill feeling from angry parents was even boiled over
[40:44.720 --> 40:51.920]  into threats against the assistant headteacher andrew moffat mba who is gay he claims to have
[40:51.920 --> 40:59.920]  received nasty emails including one which he said wouldn't last too long and it goes on from there
[40:59.920 --> 41:05.440]  the primary school which is around 720 victims is located in the predominantly muslim area
[41:05.440 --> 41:10.160]  it has come under fire from muslim parents for implementing the lgbt program which seeks to
[41:10.720 --> 41:15.840]  challenge homophobia because homosexuality is triggered forbidden in islam according to
[41:15.840 --> 41:22.000]  alum rock community forum children were removed from classes over the school's undermining of
[41:22.000 --> 41:26.880]  parental rights and aggressively promoting homosexuality which is the total goal the forum
[41:26.880 --> 41:33.040]  added that despite repeated petitions protest and dialogue integrated by parents they have
[41:33.040 --> 41:38.800]  been arrogantly ignored because the pedophile can't control themselves they will have their way with
[41:38.800 --> 41:45.920]  children until you lock them up or until they are executed everyone they used to be radical to say
[41:45.920 --> 41:51.280]  execute pedophiles now it's like those are good people don't you try to do that that you can't
[41:51.280 --> 41:56.960]  allow that to go on so they're not trying to protect children in the pedophile run demonic
[41:56.960 --> 42:02.720]  command base of the united kingdom they are using what they've already done to then come in and try
[42:02.720 --> 42:08.320]  to get their mittens on everybody else's sexual activity or porn viewing they already have it
[42:08.320 --> 42:14.160]  they want to use it they just want to legitimize that you opted into this and then demonize anybody
[42:14.160 --> 42:18.400]  else that doesn't sign up with the government to tell them where they went and what they did
[42:18.400 --> 42:24.400]  they're training you to opt in to your own slavery now i think i've spent enough time on that haven't
[42:24.400 --> 42:33.120]  i so when we come back fountain of youth scientists switch off gene to double lifespan also us
[42:33.120 --> 42:38.160]  desperate alcohol drugs and suicide at the science levels ever recorded and we're going to get into
[42:38.160 --> 42:43.600]  the big news aoc the next to susan went to prison for twenty seven thousand dollars they said was
[42:43.600 --> 42:48.320]  illegal he gave to a friend running for the senate but in the very same state and very same district
[42:49.600 --> 42:55.280]  they're saying aoc raised 18 million most of it illegal can keep the millions that's right she's
[42:55.280 --> 43:03.040]  above the law she's a good dirty coming i've been doing a lot of research into google and youtube
[43:03.040 --> 43:09.840]  censorship and i've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored the most
[43:09.840 --> 43:18.560]  buried the most suppressed and that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant
[43:19.120 --> 43:23.920]  leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt hurt when trump won
[43:25.120 --> 43:29.760]  they don't want us to have that victory they don't want us to remember what political action did
[43:31.040 --> 43:35.440]  and that's why the globalist hillary and others are trying to shut in for us now
[43:35.440 --> 43:41.520]  this is a fight about taking your speech away not just my speech about taking your very sovereignty
[43:41.520 --> 43:46.960]  away this country is in a war so again i want to thank you for what you've done but i want to

[46:57.600 --> 47:07.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:07.760 --> 47:29.920]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[47:38.400 --> 47:42.000]  well i'm gonna say it right now on air
[47:44.560 --> 47:51.520]  i take my hat off to the islamic muslim community of the uk because they're the only groups
[47:51.520 --> 47:57.920]  consistently protesting and saying no to children as young as three years of age being taught that
[47:57.920 --> 48:02.800]  they are sexually active that boys are girls that girls are boys and they've been protesting and
[48:02.800 --> 48:10.640]  saying no to the pedophile pedophile cult that runs the uk and so i salute
[48:13.360 --> 48:17.840]  the muslims in the uk for being better people than the average british citizen
[48:18.720 --> 48:22.000]  and better than the police and better than the government that's run by pedophiles
[48:22.000 --> 48:25.680]  because as bad as radical islam is and as bad as the horrible things you do are and
[48:25.680 --> 48:30.400]  you're grooming gangs and all the rest of it you're at least saying let's just kidnap
[48:30.400 --> 48:34.080]  13 year old girls and turn them into sex slaves which is terrible but you're not saying let's
[48:34.080 --> 48:39.600]  teach three four and five year olds uh you know the same stuff so so in the whole spectrum of
[48:39.600 --> 48:46.720]  evil in the uk i have to say radical islam and the muslims are now better and we just covered
[48:46.720 --> 48:51.440]  that in the last segment how they are radically brainwashing children how they're telling boys
[48:51.440 --> 48:55.520]  they're really girls girls are really boys they're sexualizing them they're abusing them
[48:55.520 --> 49:00.960]  it's pedophilia and the muslims have come out and said it's wrong and are the people standing up
[49:02.000 --> 49:05.200]  and i know there's been the golden age of islam and i know there's been islamic countries and
[49:05.200 --> 49:09.440]  nations that were actually open and free during different parts of civilization but the current
[49:09.440 --> 49:15.040]  one run by the al qaeda will hobbyist how the saudi arabia is pure evil but i would welcome islam to
[49:15.040 --> 49:21.680]  reform itself and then team up with the west to try to stand up against satanic activity but
[49:21.680 --> 49:25.840]  right now the left is in love with islam because they think you're against christianity so they
[49:25.840 --> 49:30.880]  made a deal with you but now the left doesn't want know what to do because islam is standing in the way
[49:31.920 --> 49:39.040]  of the left perverting five-year-old children so this is a quite a conundrum quite a paradox
[49:39.040 --> 49:45.120]  that we're going to be discussing but i take my hand off to the muslims of the uk out of the giant
[49:45.120 --> 49:53.920]  rotting filthy capitulated passed out submissive demonic drunken island of all the rotten parts
[49:53.920 --> 49:58.960]  of the fish i guess you're the least rotten i have to say it maybe maybe the uk will be
[49:58.960 --> 50:03.840]  liberated by islam i mean they still have a lot of child kidnapping a lot of six slaves but
[50:05.040 --> 50:11.520]  you know that they kind of stop at 12 year olds and so maybe we're being liberated by islam actually
[50:11.520 --> 50:16.960]  because the left is even worse than radical islam and i'll just go ahead and say it and i kind of
[50:16.960 --> 50:23.440]  been having this epiphany because the christians won't say a damn thing in the uk okay let's stop
[50:23.440 --> 50:33.840]  right there uh the next thing i'm going to get to is so big that i really don't want to just
[50:33.840 --> 50:38.560]  put it out there and not give it the attention it deserves but i'm going to do it because my brain
[50:38.560 --> 50:43.280]  thinks a little bit different than a lot of people's and i always kind of have a memory and i think
[50:43.280 --> 50:48.480]  about how it connects to things and how it ties into other events that have unfolded
[50:52.560 --> 51:00.400]  and so yeah everybody's really excited right now that aoc the meth mouth the creature from the
[51:00.400 --> 51:06.640]  methamphetamine lagoon everyone is just so excited that she she didn't steal a million she
[51:06.640 --> 51:10.880]  didn't steal two million i went in this morning when i saw it into the sec records
[51:12.880 --> 51:19.040]  and the federal election commission records and that's why she ended up running she was a front
[51:19.040 --> 51:24.560]  person for soros money and didn't just get 18 million we found other packs you'll hear about
[51:24.560 --> 51:30.960]  those the next few days of course her and her business manager pocketed millions totally illegal
[51:30.960 --> 51:38.720]  but when you're a democrat you're allowed to do it so the rest of the story uh here in just a moment
[51:38.720 --> 51:48.320]  that said we have some big specials that are going to be ending this week that are some
[51:48.320 --> 51:54.480]  of the biggest specials we've ever had and our products that if you're a man particularly
[51:54.480 --> 52:01.680]  you're insane if you're not taking i set out with top developers this is products put down
[52:01.680 --> 52:07.440]  about two years took about a year to get it done and i said i see all these testosterone boasters
[52:07.440 --> 52:12.080]  and all these other libido boasters and i know that the industry marks things up seven times on
[52:12.080 --> 52:16.800]  average i just want to mark it up 150 percent and i want to take most of the money and put it
[52:16.800 --> 52:21.120]  into the product instead of having two dollars a product i want to have 10 15 dollars a product
[52:21.120 --> 52:27.040]  in it and companies go no one's ever done that no one does that usually the container the bottle
[52:27.040 --> 52:31.200]  is more cost than what's in it and herbs and stuff that god gave us are so incredible it
[52:31.200 --> 52:36.400]  still blows people away and that's where all the modern drugs and all that stuff comes from is
[52:36.400 --> 52:42.400]  copying what's in plants what's in herbs what's in minerals what's in compounds so i set out
[52:42.400 --> 52:53.760]  out with this product alpha power to produce something that is the strongest libido stamina
[52:53.760 --> 53:01.440]  energy sports natural healthy enhancer that you can get you can pay a hundred bucks for
[53:01.440 --> 53:08.240]  something that isn't as good and it's usually a great deal at 69 dollars it's 34 95 right now
[53:08.240 --> 53:14.640]  it's 50 percent off and if we've got a combo deal going where you can give it the strength
[53:14.640 --> 53:21.680]  and recovery combo you can get it with bodies ultimate turmeric formula and again the average
[53:21.680 --> 53:26.480]  turmeric formula this is so hard to isolate and it's so powerful it's three to five percent
[53:26.480 --> 53:31.120]  they know you're getting a result with that i said is it safe to give them the strongest available
[53:31.120 --> 53:37.040]  and they said well no one's done it maybe other top rounds are 80 percent they said no one else
[53:37.040 --> 53:42.400]  does that a couple brands of 80 percent they said our chemists can give you 95 percent this is tested
[53:43.040 --> 53:50.720]  curcuminoid and i said i want 95 percent curcuminoid so our turmeric is fresh and organic and
[53:50.720 --> 53:55.280]  there's an extraction patented process we got to pay a lot of money for where it's 95
[53:55.280 --> 54:01.680]  percent curcuminoid if you don't know what that means it's insane i personally if i take a leave i
[54:01.680 --> 54:06.560]  get incredible heartburn and i feel horrible ad vile works really great for me it's a great product

[57:20.880 --> 57:27.840]  millions and now she's in a lot of trouble it's almost say this right now aoc needs to be under
[57:27.840 --> 57:32.960]  the prison but they're going to try to spin this but if we get the story out accurately we could
[57:32.960 --> 57:40.640]  send aoc to prison and by the way the the planets have aligned here the planets have aligned the

[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:28.320]  well i'm ever ever class high society god's gift to ballroom
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:40.560]  all right let's get serious here faith goldie is on the show and by the way i didn't do producing
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:47.040]  today she she did a bunch of big interviews with people at cpaq that were republicans censoring
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:51.920]  other people and she confronted them so that's the whole point of the interview and i just didn't
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:56.160]  get here for a production meeting this morning so we'll have to move faith to tomorrow if we don't
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:02.640]  have that it was the same story yesterday and i just i do my producing now live on air well we
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:06.720]  have the videos okay i'm gonna print on those things and i'm not bitching at the crew this is
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:11.680]  totally transparent television you wonder why you tune to cnn it's the same report and the same
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:16.320]  talking points every show for like a week straight it's because corporate guys write up the agreement
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:23.680]  they check with other corporations they have a consensus and then they put it out and that's
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:29.200]  what they do over and over again so that's why it's so boring it's why it's so stale you know it's
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:34.320]  not spontaneous that's why i can go on joe rogan the first time it's the biggest podcast he ever
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:39.360]  does the second time it's the biggest podcast he ever does breaking that previous record because
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:47.600]  people are hungry for reality even if some of it is a train wreck joe's the biggest podcast from
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:57.600]  the world and i'm number one every time i go on why because the people are hungry because the people
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:07.360]  don't want to be spoon fed garbage over and over and over and over again they're sick of it they're
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:15.680]  tired of it so i'll say it again faith goldy coming on hangs in the balance on if i get printouts
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:21.680]  about what she's doing exposing republican insiders establishment guys because your average talk
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:26.560]  shows on fox will prepare an hour for an interview like every segments an hour of preparation i don't
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:31.440]  do that but i talked to her saw what she did it was great it's nothing against her she just won't
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:37.040]  be on if we don't have that information so that's where i stand because i've got i've got like seven
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:43.360]  or eight stacks of prepared research i did i mean i did an hour of research on that stack i did 30
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:48.960]  minutes of research on that stack i did probably 45 minutes of research on that stack i did hours
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:53.600]  of research on this stack previously and then currently and i did a bunch of research on this
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:03:00.080]  stack and so i'm here and i'm not complaining i'm just telling you that that's why i don't talk in
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:05.200]  the hallways it's why i don't like these little dances and little social network things and little
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:11.120]  the thing that everybody does yes too late for a drink of too late for drink of three and a half
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:16.480]  minutes three three minutes 23 seconds long so but i like a drink of chrome because it's something
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:21.040]  people said didn't exist it wasn't happening so we're going to start the next segment we're going to
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:30.080]  come in we're going to come in with uh the anvil of chrome which is put in the computer backwards
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:34.880]  i love it but chrome of anvil just so those cute little mistakes you end up worshiping
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:38.480]  we'll play chrome of anvil when we come in then we'll play a drink of chrome and then we'll have
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:44.320]  faith golding on and then we'll have paul watson in studio with us and it's going to be fabulous and
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:56.800]  then will that bug-eyed demon which alexandria cortez aoc will she be allowed to steal millions
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:02.240]  directly like nancy polosi's done and like maxine waters is done because they're protected
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:09.760]  will she be allowed to do all that when other people have been sent to jail for one
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:15.920]  one hundredth of what she's done we're going to name names will she get away with that
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:18.880]  and i'm predicting she won't
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:25.920]  because she's threatening the democratic party to go after all their bloodbloods
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:34.880]  and she's so unpopular and she's killing them she's about to get indicted within a few months aoc
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:42.080]  you heard it here first will be indicted and her political career is already paying charon
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:50.240]  at the river sticks the coins which is sad to see her go you know hillary was planning to run she
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:54.560]  finally said she's not i believe her but it's sad to see him go because they're so damaging
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:05:01.120]  to their criminal costs it's simple if you want to beat the globalist if you want to take on the
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:06.320]  new world order i'm not doing bitcoin pumping dumps with jack dorsi i'm not sitting here selling
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:10.560]  you cancer cures i'm not sitting here you know selling you late term abortion and all the great
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:15.680]  it is i just go out and say what is the top heart pill what is the top tumor it's the best seller
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:20.080]  because it's anti-inflammatory and what's the best lab in the country okay they're the highest rate
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:24.480]  i'm like you're only 50 per cent curcuminoid well yeah they only put five dollars product and bottle
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:29.920]  but that's still incredible sir i'm like uh what's the highest you could do a month later uh 90 95
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:34.480]  percent no one's ever done i said how much that cost a bottle that costs ten dollars no one's ever
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:38.880]  done that sir the average competitors three to five percent you're the top brand's 50 percent
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:43.280]  i'm like we're gonna have 95 percent curcuminoid i mean you understand like that's like our
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:48.720]  information is explosive our fish oil i go out and i get the cleanest the best my children take it
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:53.840]  you think i'm gonna give you fish oil that isn't the very damn best on my soul you think i'm gonna
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:57.440]  screw somebody over like one of these devil worshipers never in foreshore.com
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:12.720]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones coming to you live from the
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:20.720]  front lines of the info war
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:36.720]  adrenochrome adrenochrome hmm
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:45.520]  adrenochrome first hit pop culture in 1971 when gonzo journalist hunter s thompson wrote about
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:53.440]  it in his book fear and loathing in los vegas he wrote that his lawyer oscar acosta was defending
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:07:01.520]  a satanist who was charged with molesting a child the satanist client paid his lawyer with adrenochrome
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:08.320]  and claimed the only source was the adrenaline glands from a living human body
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:17.120]  if you search google for adrenochrome the google supported result is from the conspiracy wiki
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:25.840]  which suggests that it is all merely fantasy but just to the right you will find that adrenochrome
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:34.000]  is real according to scientific research adrenochrome is formed by the oxidation of its precursor
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:42.560]  adrenaline adrenaline is the active hormone from the adrenal medulla otherwise known as epinephrine
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:53.280]  epi pens are auto injectors that contain synthetic adrenaline developed by the us military to protect
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:59.920]  soldiers in the event of chemical warfare epi pens are used to treat extreme allergic reactions
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:10.080]  epi pens only have a shelf life of about 18 months according to the manufacturer after 18 months
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:16.080]  the oxidation process begins and the epi pens are turned into adrenochrome
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:26.880]  interestingly both companies that manufacture the epi pen mylon and calio are connected to the
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:37.280]  clinton foundation ambrosia a controversial new startup company was recently charging
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:45.840]  eight thousand dollars to fill your veins with the blood of young people founder and ceo dr jesse
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:52.560]  carmesan who claims it will give you superhuman powers has recently ceased patient treatments
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:09:01.680]  due to a recent fda warning in greek mythology ambrosia means immortality and was the food of
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:09.440]  the gods that gave longevity or immortality to whoever consumed it it is believed by many
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:17.040]  researchers to represent the blood of the young the cosmetic industry has been using
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:25.440]  aborted fetal tissues in various anti-aging skincare products the taboo culture of consuming
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:33.360]  the young seems to go back through all of human history but now it seems to be coming out into
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:41.440]  the open democrats are pushing for full term abortions the infant would be delivered the
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:47.440]  infant would be kept comfortable the infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:53.040]  the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mothers
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:57.280]  and telling us that the future is too grim for us to think about raising a family
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:02.320]  there's scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:09.040]  is it okay to still have children how far is this going to go before humanity has enough
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:24.960]  for news wars dot com this is greg rees
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:46.640]  well here we are march 5th 2019 toe to toe with the globalist nationalism
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:50.640]  sweeping the planet it's coming out they're keeping babies alive selling their organs
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:57.680]  radical islam's being exposed so much insane stuff is unfolding aoc's been caught in major
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:04.480]  campaign fraud that would have sent to desiccita prison for a thousand years he gave 20 something
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:10.000]  thousand dollars that wasn't filed right he was sent to jail for nine months another couple
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:17.360]  years of probation for the crowd being a popular documentary filmmaker and now oh aoc and her
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:23.120]  chief of staff could be facing jail time of their control over the pack was intentionally
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:29.360]  hidden former fec commissioner says how about you kept over a million dollars of it how about
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:35.120]  you didn't disclose it you go to prison but democrats are allowed to commit crimes look at
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:42.800]  hillary and the billions of illegal money why are republicans protecting the democrats why is
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:48.160]  the republican blue blood establishment who tried to keep trump out being put in power by trump
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:53.440]  that's my greatest criticism of the president who's doing so many good things so many good things
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:57.920]  i was reading he's ending bulk collection data on the average citizen
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:02.640]  that violates the fourth amendment trumps announced that he's not going to let the n i say illegally
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:08.720]  spying everybody incredible and trying to get us out of these wars and trying to cut taxes on poor
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:13.520]  people look i'm i'm upper middle class i'm not some super rich guy people think what the media says
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:17.040]  we're bringing a lot of money but we spend it the company has a lot of money but then it's spent
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:22.800]  the alex jones person you know wants to get more money to spend more money i'm not against having
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:26.800]  money or having a nice car or swimming pool for your kids to begin or good health care but i don't
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:32.960]  worship money it's not my goal to get more more more more it's not my god but they always try to
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:36.640]  pose like i've got all this incredible money uh and and you know it just goes from there but
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:44.800]  quite frankly one democrat attack on trump is that a lot of middle class and upper middle class in the
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:50.720]  nuvo reach people making a million bucks a year or whatever their taxes went up and that's because
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:55.440]  that's where most of the money's at now the billionaires they're all exempt basically but trump
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:13:01.760]  passed laws to get rid of property tax exemption in blue states because that's where they have it
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:06.160]  it's in all the states but you know federal tax exemption he got rid of one of his biggest
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:12.560]  write-offs that's cost him billions because we need funding and you shouldn't have all these
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:17.280]  write-offs by ultra rich so you know warren buffett's always though rich don't pay taxes i want to
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:22.560]  pay more taxes but he writes the laws to not pay the taxes he thinks you're an idiot joining us
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:27.120]  writing shotgun for the next few segments and paul joseph watson comes in is faith goldie
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:32.480]  she ran for mayor and was there 30 plus candidates was number three they banned her on internet tv

[01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:01.280]  establishment or really just democrats and the type of sabotage they're involved in and why this
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:05.440]  is happening you got so many big interviews on your twitter right now and michelle malkin and you
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:09.760]  which don't clash two beautiful women together two smart women in fact just get that off screen

[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:18.080]  and what you saw at cpac yeah absolutely alex thanks for having me on i saw a lot of the info
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:22.720]  wars team on the ground including paul joseph watson of course the always amazing jake loy it was
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:27.760]  good to be among some friendlies on the ground because i have to say it would seem as though the
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:33.920]  america first crowd is now totally surrounded by the enemy you called them globalists there are
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:41.760]  a million different names for this multi-pronged multi-headed sort of demon globalist neocon people
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:48.480]  who hate america they're corporate pigs who have absolutely no interest in protecting
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:58.240]  the president or frankly i think the core essence of his 2016 message which was america first america
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:05.360]  first and we saw that in even the president's remarks on the ground at cpac look alex um
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:11.120]  i love donald trump i want him to be reelected but not just because i love his personality but
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:17.440]  because i love his instincts i love what he stands for but we saw on the floor in cpac even a little
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:24.160]  bit at the last state of the union was a clear pivot in what donald trump 2020 might look like in
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:31.280]  comparison to the donald trump that we all came to know and love during 2016 we saw the we saw the
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:37.920]  commander-in-chief say that he he wants more immigration for america now we're seeing a slide
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:43.040]  of trump towards the establishment and why is that happening with faith goldie straight ahead
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:47.600]  then paul joseph watson's right there in that room he's coming out of the gates in a few segments

[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:26.080]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:38.800]  info wars dot com reporter millie weaver ran into brian skelter in the event he was having
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:43.600]  and said why did you block mark dice on your twitter he said well i can't let him have my fame
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:51.040]  well mark dies self-made is way bigger and is a patriot than somebody like brian skelter who
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:56.400]  is a walking talking joke and has about 100 000 viewers on his weekend show i mean this guy is
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:04.000]  literally a joke but that's their idea so faith goldie and some of our reporters as well jacloid
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:09.760]  others they go to c pack and we so we're not here like oh we want to be at c packer oh we want to be
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:14.880]  you if you was this once a year event all these candy-ass republicans are really democrats you
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:20.720]  know they're in most these guys not against gay guys but they're dating democrat men and so they're
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:24.800]  all like well i'll tell what how you bite your pillow you know if you don't help us do this so
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:31.280]  there's a huge homosexuality issue uh in the in the republican party and again i'm a libertarian
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:35.920]  i'm not judging people but that's what this all is so it's their event their thing they're all
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:42.880]  never trumpers they were anti-trump now trump is in now all they can do is try to block conservatives
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:47.200]  nationalists the people that brought trump to where he is so faith goldie earlier was breaking
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:52.720]  down the fact that trump is surrounded and they've got the democrat fact checkers in the southern
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:57.280]  property law center and and and right wing watch you know run by the southern property law center
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:01.200]  they're running the show having laura loomer thrown out everything and it's just this
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:07.600]  giant exercise in evil as the swamp closes in on president trump so so lay out what you saw and
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:12.720]  what you witnessed faith well say out of the gates that it's not just you know the homo heretics so
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:18.720]  to speak within the conservative movements but we actually have a very apparent to the naked eye
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:24.160]  trans lobby now full of transvestites transgenders call them what you want that we're on the ground
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:28.720]  at c-pack we're talking about discernible men dressed in things like ostentatious ball gowns
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:35.920]  etc and so you know the conservative the so-called conservative reneo conservative movement that is
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:43.520]  just grasping at at at the heels of donald trump are okay with everyone no matter where they come
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:48.320]  from no matter what they think or how they live their life they pass no judgment unless you believe
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:52.560]  in america first unless you believe in nationalism unless you believe that both illegal and legal
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:57.120]  immigration something needs to be done about the current state of policies right now so what we saw
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:03.520]  were that the america first crowd of journalists people like laura loomer like myself vidair.com
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:10.000]  several people were denied oh nick fointas as well were denied press pants passes rather
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:15.600]  other ones were denied entry into the event whatsoever even after having spent and that's
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:20.160]  because you have power you represent the people that got trump in office so he's a good guy but
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:23.920]  here are the criminals that already ran the system they're trying to keep you out because
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:29.040]  they're already so threatened by you which is so short-sighted you help get them into power
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:34.560]  and then they hate who helped punch a hole in the wall right and it's not us alex who have power
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:40.000]  it's the truth of our mess no i totally agree but you understand for these sycophants absolutely
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.920]  it's what we represent we represent the hunger and thirst for truth and righteousness and what's
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:49.040]  best for america and myself as a little canadian all i did was basically get on the ground follow
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:54.000]  the power lines follow where the money was in other words who was actually making these decisions
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:59.680]  and we ended up at the chairman of the american conservative union matt schlapp this is a guy
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:04.640]  who put on c-pack what's supposed to be the conservative political action conference which
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:10.240]  had absolutely no signs of conservatism i'm not sure what they were trying to conserve more
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:16.400]  immigration more transgenderism what what is america if that is what we're trying to conserve
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:22.560]  and hey i get it a lot of people still reminisce about the reagan revolution but that was for then
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:28.960]  we're in a new era right now america has new battles new frontiers and i'm sorry to say
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:33.760]  but a dead president is not going to be able to solve them we have to look forward and what's
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:41.200]  forward um for america is um is donald trump delivering committing to his promises of 2016
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:46.160]  not pivoting and all of a sudden becoming the parent no i totally agree and putting in burr this this
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:52.800]  this neocon granddaddy and just all of it he's put the mothership in uh over the justice department
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:56.080]  and again we still saw a lot of good stuff out of trump but also a lot of bad stuff
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:00.560]  what was the feeling there then i mean because you're raising the alarm about what you saw at c-pack
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:08.000]  it felt like frankly there's a total war on the america first crowd that's what it feels like
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:15.840]  there is a total war on nationalists and regrettably donald trump um he's got good instincts but i can't
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:20.160]  imagine that he can't see what's going on right now he like you said has done a lot of good things
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:25.840]  and on the topic of immigration which i'm of the opinion is the most central battle line that america
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:32.240]  now faces um he did great things and then enter his son-in-law jared kushner who seems to frankly
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:39.280]  be shilling for interests other than america's he enters in this whole lobby of of really strange
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:45.520]  characters and so my biggest worry for the president of the united states is not the democrats and
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:50.560]  then going ever more loony tune and towards socialism all this other crap but i'm really
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:56.400]  worried about the enemies within people who are interested in pleasing their donors as opposed
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:01.520]  to the american people and that putting on these sorts of conferences or just a bunch of frankly
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:08.800]  kabuki theater so to um almost act like a pressure relief valve release valve rather for the movement
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:13.440]  when not actually even really paying protective no you're right faith you're right faith goldie
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:18.240]  international reporter out of canada it was at cpaq and if we don't hold trump's feet to the fire
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:23.440]  because we think oh well we'll be nice we back him he's under attack yeah he's under attack by
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:28.240]  globalist media but also within by this fifth column if we don't hold his feet to the fire
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:33.280]  trump will become the enemy within trump will be fully captured by these people because we
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:40.560]  allowed him to be cut off so how do we fight to get trump back on the uh straight and narrow
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:46.960]  right well i think trump's got all of the tools that he needs his catchphrase you're fired and a
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:55.520]  recommitment to his original plan to drain the swamp trump 2016 is perfect just keep on doing
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:27:01.600]  that do not pivot do not shift and if you got any dead weight that is trying to bring you down and
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:07.360]  turn your entire movement into a corpse of several years ago fire them get the hell out of your
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:12.400]  circles i get that cushioners gonna stay there because donald trump is in many ways a dynastic
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:16.640]  leader he's someone who loves his family wants to keep them close fine leave jared but that doesn't
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:21.120]  mean you have to listen to everything that he says fire everyone around him who was saying that you
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:27.360]  need to move towards open borders there is an open borders axis inside the white house oh absolutely
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:30.640]  but let me bring this up and we're gonna come back here we're gonna come up with your powerful
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:35.360]  michelle malcon interview i don't know kusher for the man of the moon and i got tricked into these
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:40.800]  white house battles of who's who and you know what's going on faith but i mean sometimes when i hear
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:44.880]  somebody's so bad from everybody they might be good they're always saying i'm the worst guy in
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:49.120]  the world and i'm not defending jared kusher uh but trump's got a good instinct he seems to like
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:52.960]  the guy he seems to have gotten some peace deals done but that everybody that knows on the inside
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:58.160]  says kusher's the worst thing since gonorrhea so so all i'm saying is what's up with the cushioner

[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:52.400]  and so multifaceted that i can't even imagine that but let me say let me tell you something
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:58.960]  you get a real eye into the corrupt elements of the cia and the ford foundation and the global
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:04.480]  is the ruling class in the early 1990s because they're putting the clintons in office and decades
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:10.080]  later a few years ago we got via lawsuits via judicial watch their internal meetings when they
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:14.000]  first get elected to the white house they're not worried about the russians they're not worried
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:18.640]  about the chinese they're not worried about mexico they're not worried about india they're not worried
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:26.080]  about their blood pressure reports they're worried about independent media and quote conservatives
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:32.480]  and christians and nationalist groups and veterans groups because veterans take action those are people
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:39.360]  that will do something they've done things they've been empowered they've seen things they're like
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:49.840]  how do we keep control of conservatives and christians and like well we have the media demonize
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:55.440]  anybody that sells a book or a video or has a website it was even before websites they say
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:36:00.480]  joseph farrah runs the western journalism center for world net daily we want him stopped
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:06.000]  and boy they were smart because it was world net daily was a key trigger organization for us
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:12.640]  and a key breakthrough so they're smart i wasn't a world net daily for like three years later
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:16.400]  but they already were like stop joseph farrah
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:24.080]  they said if we allow them to have an economy and if we allow them to have a community
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:29.920]  we're gonna lose well here's the thing they're censoring us all in mass just proving what we
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:35.120]  said and we've already blown them wide open so i don't want to say we're winning because i don't
[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:43.040]  want to put you to sleep but we're winning i mean believe me folks i used to say i was this
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:48.880]  negative guy we were behind we're winning and as long as i'm willing to get killed or put in
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:53.120]  president or you are us leaders that's what men do i'm out there being a tough guy i don't want
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:59.760]  that to happen but fill your damn hand let's go i wish it was that easy as long as we don't back
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:04.560]  down we win and that's what's so sad about trump is that he's done so much good but he's surrounded
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:10.240]  by the swamp and the deception and he is starting to sink into it even as he sinks he's doing good
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:15.920]  things but we see the swamp come like the bubbles are coming up down his eyes or right up to here
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:20.640]  we're like we're up to our guts just trying to get him out you know and so faith goldy and closing
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:24.160]  i want to air some of this michelle mount can interview and get you back on the great work
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:27.760]  you're doing but just other thoughts about this epic moment nashry we're in right now
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:32.960]  absolutely look like i said alex the truth is on our side that's why they're afraid of we christians
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:38.640]  we patriots but it doesn't matter how much they try to censor us you specifically because we are so
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:44.720]  right and because truth will always prevail we will continue to rise they can call us grifters but
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:49.440]  let me tell you the difference between the true grifters within conservative ink and we patriots
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:54.720]  we actually have a message we're not just trying to sell you a brand like coke or pepsi we're not
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:38:01.440]  selling you a brand we are trying to help and we don't back down when the heat supplied oh that's
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:06.560]  for sure if anything you just that heat just makes me go out even faster it's it's kinetic molecular
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:10.720]  theory i just keep on moving faster every single time they turn up the heat absolutely they don't
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:15.040]  realize that it says this is that because you talk about god it's real it's not a bad heat with god
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:20.320]  it's that love is so hot they think they're gonna intimidate me i've already met god i'm not even
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:24.720]  i'm feeling guilty that i haven't been good enough i mean they think they're threats to anything are
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:29.600]  they kidding no it's a calling it's it's like a soldier in battle you're not going to just stop
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:33.200]  because some shelling has come your way you're going to keep on fighting even harder because
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:36.800]  you know your brothers and arms are right here and you all need each other in order to get through
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:41.200]  this and let me tell you alex i look at you as a brother in arms so many other great independent
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:45.040]  media out there and i ain't going anywhere i know you're not going to go anywhere so it doesn't matter
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:48.720]  how much they keep on trying we're going to find new ways and through the grace of god we are going
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:55.040]  to continue to grow in numbers and to you folks at home no one is coming to save us we all have
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:39:00.000]  to put in the work so emerge from behind your keyboards watch this spread it but then also
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:05.600]  go be active have these conversations in real life as well we all have to do our part because if
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:09.600]  they just see a couple of leaders they try to take us out but if our numbers keep on growing and we
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:16.240]  go to a grass roots a truly grass roots revolution which means to return to the old order there's
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:20.880]  absolutely nothing that these demons and lizard people can do to shut us up that's right and the
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:25.680]  old order is the new order of renaissance and humanity and everything that we've seen in the
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:30.880]  human ethos in the last 2500 years coming right out of where you're from in the greek isles

[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:12.640]  during the campaign a family that lobbies for the cap to be busted on detrimental policies
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:20.240]  like the h2b visa a family that sends away angel moms without trump's permission on the eve of a

[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:27.680]  joseph watson what do you want to hit first because there's a lot of epic stuff we haven't
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:33.440]  covered yet um let's start off with c pack alex because i was there briefly for about an hour
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:36.960]  basically what happened was you know faith was talking about it in the previous segment
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:43.120]  they banned law reluma they banned nick fuentes but they allowed in the very people who are working
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:49.280]  who are abusing their platforms at cnn buzzfeed and these other publications to silence conservatives
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:54.720]  they let those people in gave them platforms they were doing media row they were front and center
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:59.280]  basically gloating over what they've done i'm talking about olive dorsi i'm talking about jared
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:06.480]  halt i was walking through jared halt saw me stopped his interview then like immediately ran off
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:11.040]  so these people are front and center c pack lets them in and if you would have dared address the
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:17.920]  loyalty you would have been taken down immediately the other thing is they had stalkers so like the
[01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:22.400]  media wouldn't try to talk to me even though they were all taking pictures of me and lumen whoever
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:28.080]  else they would cut sidle up next to us and listen into our conversations and then they would like
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:33.600]  follow us back to the hotel and take shots of who we're with who we're talking to oh yeah when i was
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:37.520]  at trump hotel a few months ago they're like jones was seeming an attractive blonde it's my wife
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:42.640]  jones was kissing a woman and and and like grabbing her breast and it's like it's in major
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:47.600]  newspapers yeah it's my wife yeah so they were behaving like stalkers and yeah they were following
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:52.640]  forage around doing the same thing so they behaved like stalkers they didn't want to actually have a
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:56.800]  conversation with us they just wanted to eat but if you attempt to talk to them like i did
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:00.960]  oliver d'arcy last year or like laura limmer did they have the right wing watch realm of the sun
[01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:08.160]  probably lost center because x cathedra you are x communicated totally and they were like oh he told
[01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:12.960]  laura luma to get jared hall i just said go and have a conversation with him so you know it was
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:16.800]  interesting but as he said you know there were media hit pieces about me before i went or when
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:23.120]  i was at c-pack saying oh you called it cooked in 2017 it is cooked i mean they don't even talk about
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:26.720]  immigration let's expand on that it's all over the british news and the guy that sent me the next
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:31.440]  prime minister says ban you and tommy robinson oh completely this is tom watson who's going to be the
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:36.240]  next leader of the labor party potential next p.m writes a letter to google and he's he's basically
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:41.440]  on this every he says i control the regulatory systems and i demand they be banned immediately
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:46.240]  this outrageous tyranny have you seen the other story today talked about social media censorship
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:51.200]  alex headline royals get tough on cyberbullying aids one social media follows they could be
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:57.280]  reported to police for abusing megan markle who is this big social justice warrior leader now
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:51:03.120]  they're having the gender neutral baby so now they get to have their speech and force feed it to your
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:08.240]  kids but this is this is where it gets but if you criticize your platform this is where it gets weird
[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:13.840]  because they're talking about the royal family having the power to delete comments on twitter
[01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:19.040]  to delete tweets nobody has the power to delete tweets apart from twitter employees no no no no
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:26.240]  ball of the account what did i tell you i'm not going to get an inside baseball but in my
[01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:30.240]  terrorization campaigns of people serving the system what do you think hit the red button
[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:40.800]  mm they have given top podcasters the top hundred i know of on google on youtube on itunes curating
[01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:46.320]  power so they've let them in remember like a year and a half ago project veritas got the video yeah
[01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:51.360]  where they had the new work times going oh we stop alex jones we stop veterans we stop pro gun
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:56.560]  groups anybody with american flags remember he says he's in the computer remember when cnn knew what
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:00.960]  we were doing yeah they've given them that power this is what i'm talking about and this ask no i
[01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:05.360]  know it's what you're talking about so it says they're gonna remove obscene offensive or threatening
[01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:10.480]  comments and the examples they gave were people making fun of mega markle basically you can't do
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:15.520]  that on twitter unless you have insider access they can flag it up so so think about the racketeering
[01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:19.840]  poll think about the corporate violations of federal law that they're letting private groups
[01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:24.160]  corporate groups royal families in control that's the new breakaway civilization where if you're a
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:30.320]  good globalist you get technocracy connections completely by the way i can't give you the details
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:35.280]  paul but look at me right now i already knew this so i basically bluff people into admitting it
[01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:43.600]  it's people have access to everything we do yeah not not just people that work for google
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:51.200]  or youtube or facebook it's been given this is the army they've given the sjw is all of them
[01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:56.320]  nsa level connections to everything we do which is why this executive order that was mooted months
[01:52:56.320 --> 01:53:01.040]  ago is so important alex you know trump got up and spoke about an executive order to pull federal
[01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:05.600]  funding from universities if they don't adhere to free speech where's the executive order on social
[01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:12.000]  media we were promised it now from the whispers that i heard it's not going to be here until 2020
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:17.440]  campaign so it's going to be a promise on the platform you told me three days ago don't say it
[01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:21.680]  but i had dinner with the people it's going to be a promise on the platform blah blah blah
[01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:26.960]  so why we should vote for this and then i turn on fox news and it's it's trump surrogate saying that
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:32.800]  show it's not a secret well a lot that makes me pissed man you don't like make the first amendment
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:38.400]  a thing on the platform you defend it now and i'm not on some anti-trump rant to get democrats to
[01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:44.240]  love me it's not about that i can't sell out paul but this is what we need right headline florida
[01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:49.280]  lawmaker introduces stop social media censorship act to protect free speech online this has got
[01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:55.200]  teeth this finds uh social media companies with user bases over a certain amount basically twitter
[01:53:55.200 --> 01:54:00.560]  facebook and statutory damages if they delete or censor users religious or political speech
[01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:06.640]  so if we get this set into motion in in florida and have mirrored bills across the country this
[01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:12.000]  is going to be what trump should have done basically this is what we need no i agree so why
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:17.200]  do you think we'll get this next hour trump's doing a lot of good things don't get me wrong but he's
[01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:24.240]  doing a lot of bad stuff why does he not stand up against this core issue um because the people who
[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:28.000]  surround him are never going to get banned you know the the benship heroes of the world the
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.840]  prominent conservatives are never going to get banned so it's not on his table but as you know
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:36.560]  with trump it's who has access to give him information so if they don't think it's important
[01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:40.960]  then he's not going to think it's important but it needs to happen because you know i talked about
[01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:46.320]  the studies with robert eppstein the algorithmic placement and by the way we've got some clips
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:53.120]  which we can play in the next segment of the ceo of the adl former obama advisor top advisor
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:58.400]  greenblatt admitting that they have access to change the algorithm and have done to censor
[01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:02.880]  quote conspiracy theories so that's what you're saying we have the new york times we have the adl
[01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:06.960]  we now have this news guard admitting it's the control of microsoft to watch what you do in
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:13.280]  lifetime and now england the next story bans quote free porn no big porn got with them
[01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:18.080]  to make everybody go through a government id where you pay a license like to the bbc to watch tv
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:24.080]  where the government then controls and watches what porn you look at that's beyond 1984 paul that
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:30.080]  is insane well it's it's as he said it's it's to create the internet id to create that database
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:34.480]  you know we're not advocating that because porn is horrible like it shrinks your brain it's it
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:39.440]  makes me not enjoy sex as much i'm a real third dimensional person it's really horrible people
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:43.120]  shouldn't really be watching it anyway but you know well libertarians the but again they know
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:47.760]  that people are addicted they're gonna do it and so the government is gonna sell you an id where
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:53.120]  they watch what porn you look at so when you're in the jack shack the the mi6 and and then the
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:58.400]  democrats who get access to everything are gonna look over that that's gonna kill porn if porn
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:02.400]  wasn't already dead because of the free market and the decentralization this is gonna kill it
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:08.000]  but god almighty the boldness of that football well there are ways around it obviously just use
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:13.200]  a vpn it's not rocket science but yeah it's it's to create this chinese style internet id system
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:17.600]  where that's it they get you to opt into the social network that's the real evil is you get
[01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:23.520]  your porn just give us your id to the government and pay us a fee and we're gonna watch what you
[01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:27.760]  jack off to and then next it'll be more and more more this is the model for the whole internet
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:33.440]  takeover and then how the chinese credit system works is if you're friends with the person who's
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:38.800]  been watching some you know certain types of porn then you're implicated in their behavior and your
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:43.040]  social credit score gets relevant and diminished as well well they've gotten away with incredible
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:48.320]  surveillance and illegal spying and the fact that we put up with it now it just it just allows this
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:53.440]  and again i'm not a porn guy folks i'm sorry uh back back when i was about 15 years old man
[01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:58.480]  and i watched debbie dead debbie dead dalish and or new wave hookers i thought it was the best thing
[01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:02.720]  i ever saw but once i've been into the real thing and then you have a wife and you have children
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:08.400]  it's about life it's about love it's it's it's not what i so i'm not here defending porn this
[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:12.560]  isn't porn this is the top porn companies working with government to cut off all their
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:18.000]  competition and then surveil everyone while they're watching porn i couldn't think of something
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:22.800]  more nightmarish and it's already law and implements in just a few days yeah and it's
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:27.840]  all tied back to the chinese social credit score now 17 million chinese citizens have been prevented
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:32.480]  from buying plane tickets just over the last year alex that's where this is going yeah so it's
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:36.480]  going right to the worst mark of the beast level i didn't plug this whole hour for products info
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:41.200]  war store dot com info wars life dot com huge sales are about to end dozens of new t-shirts and

[02:03:45.840 --> 02:03:51.200]  no evidence it gets a little old yes crazy alex but think about that video just think how far
[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:56.320]  we've come since 2005 what there's me my brother like a couple of other employees in a little
[02:03:56.320 --> 02:04:02.560]  rinky dink office your studio was like the side what like a quarter of the size of this you were
[02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:07.760]  actually in our new studio 15 years ago that we were only in for five years before we moved here
[02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:12.160]  yeah so yeah that was it yeah and to this whole operation now which they're trying to drag down
[02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:17.600]  every available opportunity but just to compare the two it must shock you that growth because it's
[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:23.040]  not that long ago that it was an actual rinky dink operation and now look at the size of it what do
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:27.280]  you feel well that's when they got scared and shut us down we really had 87 million viewers
[02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:33.040]  not hits but people that dialed into audio or video on the sites the week of the election 2016
[02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:37.280]  and so we were the top thing biggest the super bowl that week and so they said shut him down and
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:42.240]  and ever since then it's it's but here's the good news well we've been diverting them with the attacks
[02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:46.320]  everything else has been growing so god works in mysterious ways let's come back and get serious

[02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:29.280]  coming a few hours at info wars dot com force last show that's all coming up you know paul
[02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:34.400]  i want to get into all the news but i think it's important for listeners from a cultural
[02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:39.760]  perspective all over the world to realize how far we've come there we were 14 15 years ago we just
[02:07:39.760 --> 02:07:43.520]  showed the video earlier we'll play the full video at the end of this hour
[02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:52.480]  having fun joking around if i'm a little fake taxon george w bush was and how he was as big a
[02:07:52.480 --> 02:07:59.920]  taxon as a platypus from australia or new zealand but talking about you because you're a very
[02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:06.880]  introverted guy i put a cowboy hat on you a little bit wilder but where you thought we were
[02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:11.200]  18 19 years ago and we first started working together we're like 18 years old you're 35 years
[02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:16.240]  old now it's gonna be 20 years now we're working together almost nine it's 1920 years and just the
[02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:21.600]  good news is globalism was being set up and no one even knew about it and they ridiculed anybody
[02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:24.880]  that talked about it and they had the whole corporate media behind it and they thought they
[02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:29.120]  get it done and so now we see the censorship and the attacks and all the things that are happening
[02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:33.520]  when they go my god we're getting our ass kicked no they're coming after us out in the open because
[02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:38.720]  we've been successful so as long as we hold the line i think we win paul well they're freaking
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:43.200]  out alex they are freaking out that i mean we've got some clips from this guy green black and again
[02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:49.120]  he's talking about censoring social media they've got access inside access to the google algorithm
[02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:53.760]  we've talked about youtube they've ranked their own search results to the to the extent that they've
[02:08:53.760 --> 02:08:59.040]  broken their own search engine so now you can specifically search for an exact headline of a
[02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:05.600]  video inside quotes and it comes up on page four buried beneath the wall of cnn so here's this guy
[02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:09.360]  i don't know if you want to go to this now but we got the sure whenever you want call the clips
[02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:13.920]  we got the clip this is the green black clip there are two and first he outlines how they've
[02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:18.880]  got inside access to the algorithms then in the second clip he says the conspiracy theories they
[02:09:18.880 --> 02:09:25.760]  need to ban or basically criticism of george soros so let's go to the first one we work with
[02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:33.040]  with google on using ai to try to interrupt cyber hate before it happens we work with youtube to
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:38.080]  have we to get them to change their algorithms so it lessens the likelihood that a young person's
[02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:43.360]  going to run into some of these anti-semitic conspiratorial videos we work with facebook
[02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:50.240]  on trying to use a redirect method so when you search for holocaust as a hoax you get directed
[02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:56.400]  to like a yad vashem page so there are different ways they can tweak their algorithms and adjust
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:10:03.120]  their products so they think not only about free speech not only protect a user's right to free
[02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:08.880]  speech but protect a user's right to not be harassed or hated they have done some good things to
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:14.240]  deal with very specific cases by taking swifter action when per when people perpetrate hit pause
[02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:20.880]  real quick and back it up 10 seconds so we don't cut this off and again they use nazis and they
[02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:26.800]  project nazis on the lord loomer or on trump or anybody else and they do this this is private
[02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:34.400]  groups in ai watching what you do it's so creepy it's so evil it's so entitled it's so sickening
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:40.400]  and notice alex he said not only would they have access to that to the algorithm to relegate certain
[02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:46.000]  content he said they would redirect links to their own website so they're literally talking about
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:50.160]  if you click on an info wars dot com link from google if it's still listed on google that will
[02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:54.560]  then redirect to the adl's hate website that's literally what they're going for and so what
[02:10:54.560 --> 02:10:59.600]  they're saying is we're going to steal your will you want to go to a website no you come to us
[02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:06.160]  and then the adl supports the arab spring and all this evil god it's this this guy's obama's
[02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:12.720]  former special advisor so he's high up and again um i i've searched for info wars articles whenever
[02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:17.760]  i write a new article about a similar subject say mass migration or whatever obviously i remember the
[02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:23.680]  titles of previous articles i've written go to search them in google and they're often not even
[02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:29.680]  there sometimes i have to go to some obscure forum which is linked to info wars in the past to find
[02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:33.280]  the reason and that's why you know it's powerful so let's continue with the club here it is
[02:11:36.480 --> 02:11:44.480]  um washington you know there are there are there's a gap in the in the legal regime
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:50.880]  there are techniques that extremists have used online terrorized techniques like being popular
[02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:56.000]  like doxing and swatting and that's the left of cyber bullying that are not covered by existing
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:01.280]  laws and need to be because the you know the school principal says well it's not really going to
[02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:07.360]  like going to tech where else he knows right but in very in fact the abuse online can be far
[02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:12.800]  far worse than anything physical so you know we need legislators to to catch up and to fill some
[02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:18.720]  of the gaps so america defeated the nazis and now people use the nazis to use nazi tactics on us
[02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:24.320]  paul yeah and in the second clip which we can go to he outlines directly well what is a conspiracy
[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:29.840]  what is an anti-semitic conspiracy theory it's criticizing george soros let's be clear you've
[02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:34.800]  got all these muslim members of congress saying israel shouldn't exist we don't agree with that
[02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:41.520]  we're not anti-israel we get attacked i mean even george even even netanyahu sun got called anti-semitic
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:46.400]  for criticizing soros soros is an anti-israel scumbag whether you're for israel or against it
[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:50.480]  the point is is that we're just pro america and now they're doing this to us let's go here's a next
[02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:59.920]  clip it's a remarkable moment that we're in and anti-semitism has become so mainstreamed i mean
[02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:08.080]  we see conspiracy theories by universities the horde the horrific slander directed against
[02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:13.920]  george soros is a really good example oh that poor baby soros is patient zero for the anti-semites
[02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:17.680]  because he went on what they've done is use social media 60 minutes and said he was an option
[02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:24.880]  normalize this kind of hate in ways that heretofore were were impossible to imagine
[02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:31.200]  and so what is so challenging and so paradoxical is we expect our leaders to lead
[02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:36.640]  and yet the president rather than calling this out and other political figures too by the way
[02:13:36.640 --> 02:13:44.640]  because we need we need leaders to lead in all political environments um but
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:51.120]  and redirect your searches to us eating this rhetoric only read what i say semiton has gone
[02:13:51.120 --> 02:13:56.720]  for being a bug in the system to a prevailing part of the social because the left and soros funded it
[02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:02.080]  yeah and now it's it's to the level where as he said earlier we've got tom watson potential
[02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:07.520]  next p.m of britain directly demanding youtube take this down so this is not oh it's a private
[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:12.160]  when we come back was i don't want to just mention this this is so huge you've got the guy set to
[02:14:12.160 --> 02:14:16.880]  be the next p.m the guy the shadow head of internet saying you're gonna be in paul watson everybody
[02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:21.440]  else are anti-semites you've got a lawsuit against this guy what the hell we're not against israel
[02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:26.720]  yeah so again this is but we had a right to do it we would be but they're gonna bring in
[02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:31.040]  and radical muslims this isn't always just it's a free it's a free market it's a private company
[02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:36.240]  they can do what they want this is this is the government saying you will ban nationalists or
[02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:41.600]  we will shut your ass down just like they did with those with ted doichen quigley in the hearings
[02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:46.640]  before we got banned right when exactly they said they said paul watson is number one he put out fake
[02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:51.200]  news saying a muslim random people in new york it was a muslim screaming ala agbar yeah and the
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:55.360]  story was but your crime was you were number one and these guys are control freaks they're like well
[02:14:55.360 --> 02:14:59.760]  i'm number one which again shows how fake news is used as an excuse to silence free speech because
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:05.200]  that story was imam tahwidi warning deblosio in new york about radicalization in mosques in new
[02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:10.880]  york before that attack did he warn him yes did he send a letter yes that was a real news story

[02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:46.560]  paul wars dot com for slash show let's see how my brain works paul is tenacious susah had the number
[02:20:46.560 --> 02:20:51.200]  two documentary and the number three documentary in history only michael more above him and they
[02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:55.680]  were really upset about him going on the 2016 election and so they found out they got a bunch
[02:20:55.680 --> 02:21:01.120]  of friends to give 23 000 that they said wasn't listed properly on federal forums until he went
[02:21:01.120 --> 02:21:06.880]  to jail for nine months and i've got the articles right here we can show tv viewers the susah pleads
[02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:18.560]  guilty in new york campaign finance case now we have aoc alexandria cortez with 18 million dollars
[02:21:18.560 --> 02:21:23.680]  in a secret pack she was running two years ago when she claimed she was this bartender
[02:21:23.680 --> 02:21:28.880]  and millions of dollars not just a million several million to her that she never declared under
[02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:36.480]  taxes or anywhere else but don't hold your breath for her to go to prison for that except
[02:21:36.480 --> 02:21:40.640]  she's been threatening democrats that if they don't play ball they'll all be kicked out and
[02:21:40.640 --> 02:21:45.680]  accept she's super unpopular so i think you've got a perfect storm here we're in the same new
[02:21:45.680 --> 02:21:50.640]  york district where denessa susan went to jail for nine months and was on probation for two years
[02:21:50.640 --> 02:21:56.000]  for doing nothing you've got aoc she's not hillary she doesn't get away with billions
[02:21:56.640 --> 02:22:02.320]  in secret slush funds and campaign donations i think the democratic party look at cnn you name
[02:22:02.320 --> 02:22:08.400]  it it's getting ready to hit the flusher on aoc at least if we get this out and talk about it but
[02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:14.240]  but talk about the hypocrisy because commies and socialists never own a factory they never build
[02:22:14.240 --> 02:22:21.360]  something ever write a book they just steal money paul like like bernie standards white people don't
[02:22:21.360 --> 02:22:27.360]  know what it's like to be poor i drive hundred thousand dollar vehicles i have three one million
[02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:35.600]  dollar homes i bankrupt colleges i steal people's investment what i i'm allowed to i'm bernie
[02:22:35.600 --> 02:22:42.320]  standard so where does it end well i mean look at aoc the other day with the whole um eco scandal
[02:22:42.320 --> 02:22:46.960]  okay so she's she's her campaign office in new york is a one-minute walk away from the train and
[02:22:46.960 --> 02:22:53.840]  they've racked her 29 000 in uber charges over the course of the year five thousand rides yeah and
[02:22:53.840 --> 02:22:58.080]  when that when it comes out she's just like oh it's okay when we do it we have to live in the
[02:22:58.080 --> 02:23:02.560]  modern world to create a better future will but there's another breaking scandal about aoc
[02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:08.960]  which is a complete fake news story she's tweeted that gerry fallwell said he basically
[02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:14.720]  wanted to kill all muslims at cpaq and that this is president trump's fault orange man bad this
[02:23:14.720 --> 02:23:20.320]  comment from fallwell did not happen at cpaq you can see in the video this is not a cpaq but but
[02:23:20.320 --> 02:23:25.440]  let's expand under standard islam they want to kill everybody that isn't a muslim anyway so
[02:23:27.520 --> 02:23:32.080]  yeah but this is this is this is obvious a guy talking about killing terrorists he's talking
[02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:36.720]  about concealed carry permits and you they can play the video if they want it's in i tweeted this
[02:23:36.720 --> 02:23:40.960]  yeah cue that up you know exactly he's saying we'll kill terrorists now it's like yeah but he slipped
[02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:47.280]  and said muslims and so she's accusing him of wanting to kill but aoc won't even decry venezuela
[02:23:47.280 --> 02:23:52.560]  she won't even decry isis yeah and she doesn't even recognize that this is not a cpaq she lies and
[02:23:52.560 --> 02:23:57.920]  says it's at cpaq so she can implicate the president in wanting to kill all muslims she may have
[02:23:57.920 --> 02:24:06.000]  even deleted this well let's expand on this poll what do you make of the democrats and just the
[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:11.600]  frothing the like i think it's turning people off i think we've reached i know we haven't reached
[02:24:11.600 --> 02:24:17.440]  peak insanity but i think it's now turning people off peak trump derangement syndrome has we've
[02:24:17.440 --> 02:24:21.920]  hit that alex and it's on the wane and as he said she is i think she is going to be sunk later on
[02:24:21.920 --> 02:24:27.920]  down the line nancy polosi absolutely despises aoc yeah that's my question i sense that they're
[02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:37.760]  reaching for the uh airlock trigger or the the the flusher the hook like right it's kind of yeah
[02:24:37.760 --> 02:24:43.760]  i think it was the was it the 72 election of nixon i think it was that year when again we had a very
[02:24:43.760 --> 02:24:49.600]  similar situation where the opposition to him was increasingly unhinged and absolutely insane
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:54.880]  he had a media that was basically at war with him what ended up happening he won 49 out of 50
[02:24:54.880 --> 02:24:59.360]  states he became the president obviously so a lot of people have drawn that comparison between
[02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:04.400]  the 72 nixon election and the current situation oh i think that's where it's going but when the
[02:25:04.400 --> 02:25:08.640]  battle lose the war what if trump sells out the establishment then what's the point yeah i mean
[02:25:08.640 --> 02:25:13.200]  that is that is the problem but in terms of who's gonna run for the democrats michelle obama's not
[02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:16.800]  gonna run because she needs a physical test and we know why she's not going to go through with that
[02:25:16.800 --> 02:25:22.400]  but joe biden if you look at all the polls let's be serious she has the the neck and face of a man
[02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:28.320]  she has huge shoulders it looks like she's got a a a summer sausage in her pants and we're not against
[02:25:28.320 --> 02:25:34.240]  trannies but it does appear she's like obama was raised by a trend transsexualness obsessed with it
[02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:39.520]  that michelle obama is michael which he's called in multiple speeches michael i mean i've known
[02:25:39.520 --> 02:25:43.600]  several people who are very credible people you know involved in politics and they believe exactly
[02:25:43.600 --> 02:25:47.680]  the same thing as you alec so this she's got but we worked out yesterday she has an info
[02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:52.880]  wars protein bar down there so it's all being explained because she's got nuts but it's not
[02:25:52.880 --> 02:25:57.040]  the nuts that you're thinking about well but you know we make jokes about this i mean she's a big
[02:25:57.040 --> 02:26:04.320]  old man and and and seriously i'm a libertarian i don't hate somebody but i mean the fact that
[02:26:04.320 --> 02:26:10.240]  she's got you know alabama black snake down in those pants is not a bad thing it's just that
[02:26:10.240 --> 02:26:15.120]  what weird sigh up with the elites are they are so obsessed with the first lady that's a man the
[02:26:15.120 --> 02:26:19.840]  kids are adopted and and i mean that that's true that i mean that's fake well i mean all i mean
[02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:24.480]  why do you think joan river said oh my god she's a trainee she was dead a week later i mean that's
[02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:29.760]  all i'm saying alex is that when you're around the presence of men who address like women like
[02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:33.760]  some transgender people they put the effort in they can get away with looking like a woman and
[02:26:33.760 --> 02:26:38.000]  you say well fair enough but a man in a dress is a man in a dress and when you're around men you
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:41.920]  get a certain presence a masculine presence when you're around women you get a feminine presence
[02:26:41.920 --> 02:26:48.080]  i was talking to a form that's like michelle's like jimmy's and glue me a beer right now get
[02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:54.880]  his freedom there was a former white house staffer who worked under obama at c-pack and she was telling
[02:26:54.880 --> 02:27:01.840]  me that when michelle obama was around the presence the energy was very masculine so that's all i'm
[02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:07.760]  saying i don't believe it obviously but she's watching like god damn it give me a beer bitch
[02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:16.400]  now all the polls are looking increasingly um rosia for joe biden who is 12 to 14 points ahead of a
[02:27:16.400 --> 02:27:22.080]  lot of his contenders even though he hasn't announced all his clothes so creepy joe biden is in the
[02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:26.400]  the poll position creepy joe biden we're gonna resurrect that video with the infamous
[02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:32.320]  compilation which is you know it's got over can we pull up creepy joe biden please now again by the
[02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:38.640]  way i legitimately am allowed to think this whether i'm right or wrong i mean it's america i mean
[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:44.000]  michelle obama looks like a college linebacker and then we haven't shown the video can you
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:47.600]  show her coming out of like well they dropped their daughters off at school and she comes out and it's
[02:27:47.600 --> 02:27:52.240]  like i mean everybody's seeing it's like you know it's banging around it's bouncing around she's like
[02:27:52.240 --> 02:27:58.640]  having problems getting that uh water hose in line i mean can can we maybe find that and show that
[02:27:58.640 --> 02:28:02.080]  michelle obama what's what's the name of the video where michelle obama looks like she's got a i think
[02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:06.640]  is the ellen dancing video she was like she has a rubber hose in her pants yeah it's the ellen
[02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:12.960]  dancing and again if she's a man and obama is married to a man as a woman that more power to him
[02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:20.080]  you know we're not saying that we're liberal but joe biden is coming up strong alex and again
[02:28:20.720 --> 02:28:24.560]  the it was the washington post that coined the name creepy joe biden it wasn't us the
[02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:28.800]  washington post coined that in 2015 because they said he acts creepy around women

[02:33:23.440 --> 02:33:34.480]  uh
[02:33:39.520 --> 02:33:45.440]  by the way i'm done with this subject but michelle obama looks like an nfl linebacker
[02:33:45.440 --> 02:33:53.120]  the face the the shoulders and then you see her walking around in public him and it looks like
[02:33:53.120 --> 02:33:58.640]  he's got you know four or five rolls of quarters rolling around on there for tv viewers let's roll
[02:33:58.640 --> 02:34:05.120]  some of that since paul joseph Watson brought it up here today uh and then you've got all the other
[02:34:05.120 --> 02:34:10.400]  crazy footage of jones river saying oh she's a tranny now now whether that's true or not we have
[02:34:10.400 --> 02:34:15.360]  a right as americans when jones river says it to bring it up but every time i raise it like once
[02:34:15.360 --> 02:34:20.640]  to hear it becomes a national news item can we roll the footage of uh i saw it during the break
[02:34:20.640 --> 02:34:26.640]  that was the whole point of being back i'm not mad but like whoa i was back there during the break
[02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:33.520]  and i saw the footage no not a jones rivers man i saw the footage of uh uh michael obama michelle
[02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:38.880]  obama walking outside whenever he's bouncing around in there we'll go to rebroadcast then
[02:34:38.880 --> 02:34:44.080]  all right here you go this is what i'm talking about right here and there's a bunch of other footage
[02:34:45.440 --> 02:34:50.960]  so so so you've got that going on and you've got jones rivers let's play jones rivers with audio
[02:34:50.960 --> 02:34:55.840]  because we went here we're going to show why we said this for radio and tv viewers let's go ahead
[02:34:55.840 --> 02:34:59.840]  and roll that audio i think that the country will see the first the united states will see the first
[02:34:59.840 --> 02:35:05.280]  gay president or the first woman president we already have it with obama so let's just calm down
[02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:14.960]  got it you know michelle is a trend i'm sorry she's a what a transgender we all know oh my god
[02:35:16.800 --> 02:35:20.880]  so again that's not me saying that that's show rivers but whenever i raise it like once here
[02:35:20.880 --> 02:35:25.760]  because a huge issue they never show the clip they say i made it up paul let's put bookends
[02:35:25.760 --> 02:35:29.280]  on this i'm tired talking about it but you brought it up well we can segue alex you
[02:35:29.280 --> 02:35:33.680]  were talking about the talking about transgender issues you were talking about the islam thing
[02:35:33.680 --> 02:35:39.600]  earlier where they literally go out protest the school 600 muslim parents withdraw their kids
[02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:45.360]  from the school because they're teaching lgbt to primary school children which is up to the ages
[02:35:45.360 --> 02:35:51.360]  of about it's you know it's five to ten generally speaking children that age should not be being
[02:35:51.360 --> 02:35:56.720]  taught any kind of sexuality whatsoever that's the number one so go for the muslims good for them
[02:35:56.720 --> 02:36:02.800]  but then how do they treat people who criticize lgbt who are not muslims have an article here man
[02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:07.440]  investigated by police for retweeting transgender limerick he didn't even retweet it from what
[02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:13.840]  i've learned he liked the tweet he didn't even write the tweet he didn't even write the limerick
[02:36:13.840 --> 02:36:18.640]  it wasn't even that offensive they uh they called him up they called up his employee and said
[02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:23.520]  is this your guy and it was some construction industry thing so it's total intimidation of
[02:36:23.520 --> 02:36:28.000]  anybody that isn't a muslim but the police literally said we need to investigate this because if there
[02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:32.720]  are transgender employees at your work site they are now under threat they told this guy he
[02:36:32.720 --> 02:36:37.840]  needed to quote change his thinking but this guy got lucky alex because there was another case
[02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:44.160]  after that like a week after that headline you came home arrested for calling transgender activist
[02:36:44.160 --> 02:36:50.960]  a man this was a mother of two children one of whom is disabled i believe and they just showed up in
[02:36:50.960 --> 02:36:58.320]  her kitchen whisked her away detained her processor stole her laptop and she hadn't got the laptop back
[02:36:58.320 --> 02:37:04.320]  like weeks later for basically um harassing someone by making a comment on the internet
[02:37:05.120 --> 02:37:10.800]  in which she called somebody a man as a joke so again so we have pervert police pedophile
[02:37:10.800 --> 02:37:16.080]  networks obsessed with our kids that police power now yeah so when the muslims come out and protest
[02:37:16.080 --> 02:37:21.440]  against lgbt being taught to kids are being spoken about they're listened to obeyed and they've
[02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:25.520]  withdrawn the program they're going to try and bring it back but good luck with that when non
[02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:30.880]  non-muslims do it in the uk they literally have hate crime thought crime police show up so we join
[02:37:30.880 --> 02:37:37.280]  islam so the teacher doesn't rape our children well i don't think that was the accusation but
[02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:42.560]  yeah that they yeah no but i mean that's where this is going so i guess i joined islam and then
[02:37:42.560 --> 02:37:46.480]  they won't teach my five-year-old how to get blowjobs basically yeah they won't they won't put
[02:37:46.480 --> 02:37:51.200]  up with a child drag queens they won't put up with any of that nonsense but because they're a close
[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:55.920]  knit community that doesn't take any bs they don't get trampled so so that's the paradox the lefts
[02:37:55.920 --> 02:38:00.880]  bring them in at mass but then they don't play along with what they're doing yeah because the
[02:38:00.880 --> 02:38:06.320]  left is truly cooked they do mean here's this andrew moffat guy he's a quote gay man that wants to
[02:38:06.320 --> 02:38:12.880]  teach your five-year-olds about sex that's creepy stop it there should be no teaching of any sexuality
[02:38:12.880 --> 02:38:18.400]  to five-year-old kids that is completely they want to hear about puppies and blocks and planets and
[02:38:18.400 --> 02:38:25.600]  trees and fishies have you tried like a five-year-old let me tell you about fisting because i i've
[02:38:25.600 --> 02:38:30.720]  read the articles were like we're gonna teach you about bs dm we're gonna teach you about being
[02:38:30.720 --> 02:38:35.120]  another sex and the kids are like what there do you want to be another sex i guess i do your parents
[02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:40.160]  are cut off you're taking away we're sterilizing you and then i mean this is a perv takeover the
[02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:45.120]  next step after that and they do this in sweden they directly teach the kids the boys that they're
[02:38:45.120 --> 02:38:49.440]  not boys and tell them they're not boys and give them the gender option and make them wear dresses
[02:38:49.440 --> 02:38:54.080]  and they go oh god you wear a dress yourself no it's not cliche in sweden i don't know article
[02:38:54.080 --> 02:38:58.640]  they literally made the boys wear dresses and told them they know i know pols that's what i'm saying
[02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:02.720]  all right shifting gears out of this because we don't want to here's people say we're obsessed with
[02:39:02.720 --> 02:39:08.480]  this i'm obsessed with the globalist obsessed with biologically screwing our kids up what else
[02:39:08.480 --> 02:39:14.320]  is on your front burner because globalism's in trouble nationalism's awakening good things are
[02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:19.040]  happening overall you know aoc is about to get indicted they've got all these fake investigations
[02:39:19.040 --> 02:39:24.240]  of trump none of them russia related i mean there's good news here if we just don't give up we can't
[02:39:24.240 --> 02:39:28.720]  give up alex and we're representing people who aren't in media who aren't even in this fight
[02:39:28.720 --> 02:39:34.080]  we're representing ordinary people who and this goes back to the social media aspect this is what's
[02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:38.240]  frightening to me about deplatforming which is what we should be talking about every day all day
[02:39:38.240 --> 02:39:45.600]  basically employers now in the us and the uk 70 percent of employers check a potential employees
[02:39:45.600 --> 02:39:51.360]  social media accounts and history before they even get to the interview stage if they don't
[02:39:51.360 --> 02:39:57.520]  have a social media presence it immediately raises a red flag so we're literally at the point where
[02:39:57.520 --> 02:40:02.480]  it's not just you lose your twitter account it's you lose your bank account your basic right to
[02:40:02.480 --> 02:40:08.880]  e-commerce you lose the right to book a plane ticket 17 million chinese citizens could not
[02:40:08.880 --> 02:40:13.680]  book a plane ticket in the past year because they were caught up in this social credit score system
[02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:18.640]  so now you're going to get people who are not even going to be able to get a job to get a loan so
[02:40:18.640 --> 02:40:23.360]  the mark of the beast is here and it sucks and a lot of people are going to say well let me just
[02:40:23.360 --> 02:40:28.560]  submit but like Joe Rogan talked about with me last week once you give in at one level it collapses
[02:40:28.560 --> 02:40:35.200]  then it's always more more more more more yeah and it all comes back to the social ostracization
[02:40:35.200 --> 02:40:38.800]  angle as well you know if you're not on social media what's wrong with you there must be something
[02:40:38.800 --> 02:40:43.600]  wrong with you and your friends get punished if your friends with them on the social media network
[02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:48.080]  if they misbehave you get punished oh i love what followers people are not our general audience
[02:40:48.080 --> 02:40:53.680]  people like oh what's it like being kicked off those things we have a warehouse another company
[02:40:53.680 --> 02:40:58.960]  we work with or their main customer and like all these employees wanted to quit when they announced
[02:40:58.960 --> 02:41:03.760]  back in august of last year that we were banned they said we're going under we we're not on social
[02:41:03.760 --> 02:41:09.600]  media we're the company's gone we're like no your paychecks are still coming but it's that idea that
[02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:15.920]  they have bamboozled people into it's insane yeah and it's it's it's basically creating this system
[02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:21.520]  whereby you know you've heard the announcements on the trains in china smoking on trains chat chatting
[02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:26.640]  too loudly on a train that's all going to go into your and again once you submit to that it's going
[02:41:26.640 --> 02:41:33.040]  to be your heart rates too high yeah you ate the wrong thing yeah it's always more it's seeing what
[02:41:33.040 --> 02:41:39.440]  will do there's no limit to the submission but you also get rewarded so maybe in the future if you
[02:41:39.440 --> 02:41:44.480]  have the right political opinions your flight will get upgraded your hotel room will get upgraded
[02:41:44.480 --> 02:41:49.040]  it's it goes both ways so these are corporations making their final move i want to talk to you
[02:41:49.040 --> 02:41:53.680]  about this in the final segment before we take an hour off and then we've got the war room coming
[02:41:53.680 --> 02:42:00.640]  up we're going to co-host with owen what would the world look like paul if we submitted to this
[02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:07.920]  basically a caste system of transhumanists where they've got the microchip they've got the augmentations
[02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:12.880]  and the people who reject it are cast aside not as just not being trendy but not being able to
[02:42:12.880 --> 02:42:18.880]  physically operate in the world not being able to get a house and the chip doesn't really up you
[02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:23.520]  the system shuts everyone down and says you have a chip now you can do what you want you believe the
[02:42:23.520 --> 02:42:29.840]  chip gave you power when the truth is the system cut you off yeah mark of the beast i mean it's
[02:42:29.840 --> 02:42:34.000]  maybe it's not going to be a microchip in your forehead but it's withdrawing the ability to
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:43.600]  operate in the real world in 2019 that's where we're at alex wow what a time to be alive what a
[02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:50.080]  time to be fighting back because paul once we make it past this a real adventure begins stay with us
[02:42:50.080 --> 02:42:58.400]  paul joseph watson in studio on the ats if you're not expanding you're imploding there is no set
[02:42:58.400 --> 02:43:03.440]  stasis there is no managed system there is no uncontenual the continuum is always launching
[02:43:03.440 --> 02:43:09.200]  forward in the future so you support us and get creative and get fired up we won't just be here
[02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:13.440]  a hundred years we'll be here forever we'll turn the whole thing around our grandchildren on mars
[02:43:13.440 --> 02:43:18.400]  bases and jump bases and god knows what are going to look back and say you know that we struggled

[02:48:41.600 --> 02:48:46.560]  even bigger on that yeah and this is this is why they're so afraid alex because joe rogan is the
[02:48:46.560 --> 02:48:53.280]  new media you know pewdiepie does an impersonation of a news reporter it gets millions and millions
[02:48:53.280 --> 02:48:59.120]  more views every day than fox news and cnn gets on their prime time shows that's why they're so
[02:48:59.120 --> 02:49:04.960]  paranoid you had a guy called um shane dorsen a couple of weeks ago who just gave me a shout out
[02:49:04.960 --> 02:49:09.920]  on twitter because he said he liked conspiracy theories or whatever they freaked out about that
[02:49:10.480 --> 02:49:16.000]  this is the new media that their controls being taken away they're whining about losing their jobs
[02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:22.960]  vice buzzfeed huffington post all being laid off no sympathy alex why would anyone have sympathy for
[02:49:22.960 --> 02:49:28.880]  them when they've abused their platforms time and time these are authoritarian pro radical islam
[02:49:28.880 --> 02:49:34.480]  pro war dirtbags with no viewers but the corporations give them power and they keep
[02:49:34.480 --> 02:49:39.200]  thinking if they whack us on the head i almost wanted to keep doing it i want to tell them a
[02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:44.800]  secret but i'm i'm all about the truth they have they've not done what they think they've done does
[02:49:45.520 --> 02:49:50.160]  i'll i'll just put it that ball this the state of the media is horrendous and it's
[02:49:50.160 --> 02:49:54.880]  be i've made this point many times before in the past there was no competition so all they had to do
[02:49:54.880 --> 02:50:01.040]  was you know parrot the narrative carry on the consensus now there's so much cutthroat competition
[02:50:01.040 --> 02:50:07.200]  in news commentary alone to get successful on youtube as you did for years before they removed
[02:50:07.200 --> 02:50:10.960]  your channel you have to be entertaining you have to be interesting people who work for the
[02:50:10.960 --> 02:50:15.520]  mainstream media are not entertaining they're not interesting they don't want to be and that's why
[02:50:15.520 --> 02:50:21.600]  they hate people like you talking about one by the way can we pull up mark dice's response to uh
[02:50:21.600 --> 02:50:28.880]  uh when millie weaver brought up to him why are you banning mark dice at the cp goes well i can't
[02:50:28.880 --> 02:50:35.520]  let him have my fame he's on cnn with billions of production behind him he has a hundred thousand
[02:50:35.520 --> 02:50:40.240]  viewers mark dies could fart and he would have bigger viewers it's not about who has bigger
[02:50:40.240 --> 02:50:46.240]  viewers but it's like this thing of like oh you want to be me you want like he has promethe in fire
[02:50:46.240 --> 02:50:54.560]  he has zoos lightning bolts dude you don't have it it's it's so pathetic no you shut down mark
[02:50:54.560 --> 02:50:59.120]  dies because he's more popular than you and he challenged you and you're a freaking coward
[02:50:59.840 --> 02:51:04.640]  they're so paranoid about anyone not towing the line on whatever you want to call whatever you
[02:51:04.640 --> 02:51:09.840]  want to talk about transgenderism social social justice identity politics but anyone who just
[02:51:09.840 --> 02:51:15.200]  refuses to comment on the news just stays out of the controversies is a massive threat like
[02:51:15.200 --> 02:51:19.680]  someone like shane dawson like he used to make comedy videos and stuff now he makes videos about
[02:51:19.680 --> 02:51:24.080]  how iphones are spying on people and it's kind of somewhat tongue-in-cheek and a little bit immature
[02:51:24.080 --> 02:51:28.640]  in 20 years late and 20 years late but the very fact he's talking about it with 20 million youtube
[02:51:28.640 --> 02:51:33.440]  subscribers the very fact that you're on they're threatened by the fact that he's independent
[02:51:33.440 --> 02:51:38.960]  yeah and he may have been a crap ass before but he has a soul and the minute he has the soul he goes
[02:51:38.960 --> 02:51:44.960]  wait i got kids now this is oh no now we're gonna bully you the goodness is paul they can't
[02:51:44.960 --> 02:51:50.320]  bully us all yeah and it comes back to what you just said they have a soul they haven't been bought
[02:51:50.320 --> 02:51:55.360]  off and that's why they gravitate towards people like us because for all our faults we haven't
[02:51:55.360 --> 02:52:00.480]  been bought off either they become the new media in sync with us you know there was but that's a
[02:52:00.480 --> 02:52:06.720]  key though paul there's no price tag yeah like there's like i am my problem is the more they mess
[02:52:06.720 --> 02:52:11.040]  with me the more i work and fight they think it's like making me weak it's the opposite push me
[02:52:11.040 --> 02:52:15.600]  towards a heart attack more like 20 hours a day they think it's like making me back down it's the
[02:52:15.600 --> 02:52:21.040]  opposite do they just expect you to give up like you're not going anywhere like i'm not i don't
[02:52:21.040 --> 02:52:25.600]  literally don't know how to do anything else i wouldn't want to but we're not gonna go anywhere
[02:52:25.600 --> 02:52:30.400]  nothing's gonna happen but imagine they think we're like them paul they think like like you
[02:52:30.400 --> 02:52:36.160]  like you attack me and i go away yeah no i dream about strangling you
[02:52:36.160 --> 02:52:42.960]  i it yeah and they were all skulking around the scenes of c-pack you know smacking their
[02:52:42.960 --> 02:52:47.600]  lips are who they're gonna sense next there was a wired news story it's all that pissant nobody
[02:52:47.600 --> 02:52:51.520]  they have they couldn't build an audience yeah they couldn't build a family they couldn't build a
[02:52:51.520 --> 02:52:56.800]  business literally but they can go around the system and going i'll ban them yeah i'll ban them
[02:52:56.800 --> 02:53:03.920]  i'll ban them i'll ban exactly no that oliver dawson was basically kicked out of the conservative
[02:53:03.920 --> 02:53:08.240]  movement because nobody liked him and he was unsuccessful so now he's working for cnn getting
[02:53:08.240 --> 02:53:12.800]  you shut down and it's literally those people skulking around see and he doesn't even get

[02:53:18.320 --> 02:53:23.840]  at that point but he wanted to make look skywalker pissed off so he got killed and i'm not even
[02:53:23.840 --> 02:53:29.360]  suicidal but they don't get it paul they don't have any understanding of history yeah and they're
[02:53:29.360 --> 02:53:35.280]  working in coordination they claim that they're just covering the news and covering the controversy
[02:53:35.280 --> 02:53:39.440]  they're not covering the controversy they're in direct communication with you to with facebook
[02:53:39.440 --> 02:53:43.040]  with twitter saying what about this what about this what about and they're allowed to illegally

[02:54:18.560 --> 02:54:23.120]  that was a spitted as bryan stelter tried his hand at stand-up comedy the other day
[02:54:23.120 --> 02:54:30.080]  he gave a lecture at kent state university on media ethics this is a guy whose weekend show
[02:54:30.080 --> 02:54:36.560]  is called reliable sources after his lecture was over millie weaver a lovely reporter for info wars
[02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:45.040]  dot com decided to ask him some questions hey bryan okay i did do block mark dice on twitter uh
[02:54:46.960 --> 02:54:52.480]  first of all hi thank you for asking questions millie weaver bryan yeah um they're gonna kick us

[02:55:00.800 --> 02:55:07.760]  why did you sometimes uh sometimes i block people because they're trying to gain fame and stature
[02:55:08.640 --> 02:55:14.560]  just by making silly jokes and attacks so it's not worth it he already has a big following though
[02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:19.840]  yeah i'd say it's you know he's okay i think your videos are funny you think you like his parents
[02:55:19.840 --> 02:55:24.400]  of you i've only watched a couple but they're pretty funny yeah okay so look at how uncomfortable he
[02:55:24.400 --> 02:55:30.000]  is millie you're gonna give the poor guy nightmares about me brian if you think my voiceovers if you
[02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:36.320]  are funny then why did you block me you need a man up bro and get a sense of humor sounds to me
[02:55:36.320 --> 02:55:41.760]  like you're jealous that i'm just one guy on a laptop in my kitchen who's getting a quarter of the
[02:55:41.760 --> 02:55:48.480]  viewers of cnn's prime time shows millie went on to ask him why if he supports the first amendment
[02:55:48.480 --> 02:55:55.440]  and the rights of journalists would cnn lobby the social media companies to get them to ban alex
[02:55:55.440 --> 02:56:03.200]  jones do you think that twitter should unban alex jones hitting comrades i don't know uh i think it's
[02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:10.000]  a really complicated subject i'm not sure what the right answer is i'm so weak again censorship
[02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:15.920]  how's your word of the slippery slope when against you brahman first of all i love your photos uh i
[02:56:15.920 --> 02:56:18.640]  I think it's very smart when you built up a viral following.
[02:56:18.640 --> 02:56:19.440]  What's the question?
[02:56:19.440 --> 02:56:20.560]  I enjoy the question.
[02:56:20.560 --> 02:56:22.600]  What if that slippery slope when it gets to you,
[02:56:22.600 --> 02:56:23.880]  what if you were the thing?
[02:56:23.880 --> 02:56:26.000]  But that's why I said I don't have a.
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:26.720]  It was a really good time.
[02:56:26.720 --> 02:56:30.320]  I don't know if Facebook did the right thing or not.
[02:56:30.320 --> 02:56:31.400]  That's not for me to decide.
[02:56:31.400 --> 02:56:33.120]  But CNN has called for.
[02:56:33.120 --> 02:56:33.840]  That's for Facebook to decide.
[02:56:33.840 --> 02:56:35.880]  CNN has called for some social media sites
[02:56:35.880 --> 02:56:37.280]  to crack down on infowars and outflows.
[02:56:37.280 --> 02:56:38.440]  CNN has not called for that.
[02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:38.940]  They have.
[02:56:38.940 --> 02:56:41.200]  And all we've called for darker has.
[02:56:41.200 --> 02:56:43.960]  So I think what Oliver did that was so smart
[02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:46.480]  was he just asked a really simple question.
[02:56:46.480 --> 02:56:50.320]  Do these pages violate your misinformation policy?
[02:56:50.320 --> 02:56:53.240]  And so that's actually Facebook's responsibility, not CNN's.
[02:56:53.240 --> 02:56:54.360]  What a snake.
[02:56:54.360 --> 02:56:57.000]  I think what Oliver D'Arcy did was really smart.
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.120]  Oliver D'Arcy's the weasel who literally
[02:56:59.120 --> 02:57:02.360]  led the campaign to pressure the social media companies
[02:57:02.360 --> 02:57:06.000]  to ban Alex Jones by constantly tattling on him
[02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:07.600]  for what he was posting.
[02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:09.320]  Things got even worse for Brian when
[02:57:09.320 --> 02:57:12.480]  he was asked why he blocked me on Twitter again.
[02:57:12.480 --> 02:57:14.520]  This time by Caitlin Bennett.
[02:57:14.520 --> 02:57:17.720]  She's the girl whose graduation photo from Kent State
[02:57:17.720 --> 02:57:21.600]  went viral because she was posing with an AR-15.
[02:57:21.600 --> 02:57:24.160]  Do you get mad at Mark Dice often?
[02:57:24.160 --> 02:57:25.240]  Robert Mueller was that?
[02:57:25.240 --> 02:57:27.520]  Do you get mad at Mark Dice often?
[02:57:27.520 --> 02:57:28.400]  Why'd you block him?
[02:57:28.400 --> 02:57:30.680]  So I think.
[02:57:30.680 --> 02:57:33.640]  And then complain to Jack, the CEO of Twitter,
[02:57:33.640 --> 02:57:35.360]  that he was bullying.
[02:57:35.360 --> 02:57:36.520]  We've got to go to break.
[02:57:36.520 --> 02:57:38.280]  We're going to come back to four minutes.
[02:57:38.280 --> 02:57:40.280]  And then we've got a rebroadcast.
[02:57:40.280 --> 02:57:42.400]  And then in an hour, we're going to do the whole war.
[02:57:42.400 --> 02:57:43.920]  And then we pull on myself.
[02:57:43.920 --> 02:57:45.200]  Stay with us.
[02:57:45.200 --> 02:57:47.600]  I've got some really good news, though.
[02:57:47.600 --> 02:57:49.000]  X2 is back.
[02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:53.680]  The original X2, Deep Earth Crystal, pure atomic iodine.
[02:57:53.680 --> 02:57:55.960]  What you want, infowarstore.com.
[02:57:55.960 --> 02:57:57.360]  It'll be here in a week.
[02:57:57.360 --> 02:57:59.920]  Manufactured in the US, infowarstore.com.
[02:57:59.920 --> 02:58:01.600]  With the best iodine in the world.
[02:58:01.600 --> 02:58:02.800]  X2, it's available.
[02:58:02.800 --> 02:58:03.840]  I thought X3 is great.
[02:58:03.840 --> 02:58:06.040]  We still got another Deep Earth Crystal source.
[02:58:06.040 --> 02:58:07.840]  But I thought, add the other two types of iodine.
[02:58:07.840 --> 02:58:09.160]  The scientists said, do that.
[02:58:09.160 --> 02:58:09.920]  It sold a lot.
[02:58:09.920 --> 02:58:12.360]  But people want original X2.
[02:58:12.360 --> 02:58:14.000]  I was resigned the fact we didn't have X2.
[02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:16.160]  But it came through about a month ago.
[02:58:16.160 --> 02:58:19.000]  We now have X2 again at infowarstore.com.
[02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:20.240]  So hallelujah.
[02:58:20.240 --> 02:58:22.360]  It's been sold out for about almost three months.
[02:58:22.360 --> 02:58:27.400]  But we have now had the same company, the original X2,
[02:58:27.400 --> 02:58:28.880]  developed it again.
[02:58:28.880 --> 02:58:32.440]  And we were able to do the exact same formula.
[02:58:32.440 --> 02:58:35.600]  We want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there.
[02:58:35.600 --> 02:58:37.080]  Learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[02:58:37.080 --> 02:58:39.120]  Learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it.
[02:58:39.120 --> 02:58:41.560]  Learn about how the other iodines are bound.

[02:58:46.240 --> 02:58:48.800]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water
[02:58:48.800 --> 02:58:50.360]  is a serious health issue.

[02:59:44.280 --> 02:59:45.520]  filtration system today.
[02:59:49.600 --> 02:59:52.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:52.440 --> 02:59:54.440]  Hello.
[02:59:54.440 --> 02:59:54.920]  Let's go!
[03:00:12.440 --> 03:00:17.720]  All right, coming up in an hour when this show's over,
[03:00:17.720 --> 03:00:21.800]  we're going to co-host the once shawyer of the War Room
[03:00:21.800 --> 03:00:28.840]  infowars.com for our show. Ask me anything, Reddit. But Paul, we can't get an inside
[03:00:28.840 --> 03:00:33.120]  baseball, but we'll do some of it when we start the next show, because it's so sad
[03:00:33.120 --> 03:00:37.920]  that he was a scary at stuff. Everyone that's worked here, they offer more and more money
[03:00:37.920 --> 03:00:46.640]  to just lie about us. You've been working with me 18, 19 years. We didn't script this
[03:00:46.640 --> 03:00:52.800]  for viewers out there. What is infowars? Infowars is a platform that absolutely terrorizes
[03:00:52.800 --> 03:01:00.640]  the establishment, because our only motivation, our only dependence, our only loyalty is to
[03:01:00.640 --> 03:01:05.040]  the listeners. They built us up from nothing. They funded us throughout this. They had our
[03:01:05.040 --> 03:01:11.120]  backs when we were almost toppled last year. And that's why they're so paranoid, because
[03:01:11.120 --> 03:01:16.920]  we don't take giant checks from Gulf state dictatorships like CNN does. We don't take
[03:01:16.920 --> 03:01:21.240]  giant checks from George Soros like, you know, right wing watch does and all these other
[03:01:21.240 --> 03:01:25.760]  organizations. We can't be controlled. The threat of something that can't be controlled
[03:01:25.760 --> 03:01:31.560]  in today's society where everything is so anodyne and so stale from culture down to sports,
[03:01:31.560 --> 03:01:36.880]  down to news, down to media, whatever. That is like unheard of now. That is why we represent
[03:01:36.880 --> 03:01:42.160]  such a big threat because they don't agree that we can't be bought. But beyond not being
[03:01:42.160 --> 03:01:48.760]  bought, who are we? You've known me 18, 19 years. I saw your writing hired you. We've
[03:01:48.760 --> 03:01:54.880]  known each other. You've been in the entire main just as much as I've been. What is infowars?
[03:01:54.880 --> 03:02:01.360]  What do we stand for? We stand for freedom, freedom of speech. We stand for basic principles
[03:02:01.360 --> 03:02:06.960]  and values. We stand against the absolute insanity of identity politics that has beset
[03:02:06.960 --> 03:02:11.000]  the West over the past five, 10 years. That's come to the point where we literally have
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:17.600]  the media celebrating child drag queens. Did you ever think you'd see the day when that
[03:02:17.600 --> 03:02:18.600]  was happening?
[03:02:18.600 --> 03:02:25.560]  They're killing babies after they're born. So we stand for life and the standard biological
[03:02:25.560 --> 03:02:33.360]  operation of Homo sapiens. Yeah, the basic biological coding of Homo sapiens. And yet
[03:02:33.360 --> 03:02:40.360]  we're under the most attack. What could that possibly mean, Alex, about the other side?
[03:02:40.360 --> 03:02:43.560]  But let's get into negative points in the two minutes we have to break. We'll talk about
[03:02:43.560 --> 03:02:49.920]  it more because we need to be totally honest here. What are the faults of infowars?
[03:02:49.920 --> 03:02:54.760]  I don't know. As any media organization does, sometimes we make mistakes. We try to correct
[03:02:54.760 --> 03:02:59.120]  them. I mean, those are the major faults. We are gunko. We do get out there getting
[03:02:59.120 --> 03:03:02.720]  people's faces and, you know, sometimes we may need to be a bit more sophisticated about
[03:03:02.720 --> 03:03:07.520]  things, but in the heat of the battle, we sometimes swing a little hard. Exactly. What
[03:03:07.520 --> 03:03:12.160]  about the enemies? You've experienced the traders pay to lie about us. They think that
[03:03:12.160 --> 03:03:15.360]  it hurts us that they tell the lie. It hurts us that they're falling. But what would you
[03:03:15.360 --> 03:03:17.440]  say the traders?
[03:03:17.440 --> 03:03:21.560]  They must have convinced themselves that they've got this moral crusade to shut us down and
[03:03:21.560 --> 03:03:25.840]  that we're inherently evil. They must have convinced themselves of that in some way.
[03:03:25.840 --> 03:03:31.560]  At some level, the people at the top obviously know what this is all about. They stand on
[03:03:31.560 --> 03:03:35.160]  the wrong side of history. But the people on the lower levels, I think they've actually
[03:03:35.160 --> 03:03:40.680]  convinced themselves that we need to be toppled for the good of the world. We're a news organization,
[03:03:40.680 --> 03:03:44.720]  essentially, like how bad of an influence can we be having if they think they're in
[03:03:44.720 --> 03:03:45.720]  the moral right?
[03:03:45.720 --> 03:03:50.040]  And we're promoting freedom for families, free market, everything. Exactly. But you're
[03:03:50.040 --> 03:03:54.080]  right. They get weak minds to say, oh, you're somebody special. You can challenge this.
[03:03:54.080 --> 03:03:58.440]  You can do this. And then they just make up fantastic lies.
[03:03:58.440 --> 03:04:03.520]  It's absolutely shocking. I'll Google my new, my name on Google News every day to see the
[03:04:03.520 --> 03:04:09.080]  latest hit piece. And it's like, what was the song? You know, sounds like Satan, but I'm
[03:04:09.080 --> 03:04:13.040]  not to them or something. There's a lyric, something, Neil Young lyric, something to
[03:04:13.040 --> 03:04:18.040]  that effect. But yeah, I get up every day and look in the mirror, and that's not the
[03:04:18.040 --> 03:04:22.640]  person who I see being demonized on the internet in the media. That's not the person.
[03:04:22.640 --> 03:04:26.480]  Well, that's the secret is that you had dinner last night with former employees who are gonna
[03:04:26.480 --> 03:04:31.680]  do big, you know, New York Times hit pieces. Go to the comic book, Lie World. You think
[03:04:31.680 --> 03:04:37.120]  you have some power? In fact, I don't even probably sue you because you're a joke. You're
[03:04:37.120 --> 03:04:43.160]  a fraud. You're a nobody. And you're a miserable person whose wife will throw you out right
[03:04:43.160 --> 03:04:48.560]  after you're done doing this. You're nothing but toilet paper. I'm not your enemy. You're
[03:04:48.560 --> 03:04:54.080]  your enemy because you come from slaves.
[03:04:54.080 --> 03:04:58.160]  You know, the worst part about getting old, and I'm still strong at 45, is that I won't
[03:04:58.160 --> 03:05:01.920]  be there for my children someday. That's why I need to make them strong now. Now I can
[03:05:01.920 --> 03:05:07.040]  be there for my children. Now I can make them strong. Now I can instruct them. Now I can
[03:05:07.040 --> 03:05:10.400]  teach them what I've learned, but not once I'm gone. You think of this digital age,
[03:05:10.400 --> 03:05:13.440]  your words gone forever, but now they're even better, getting rid of what you said they
[03:05:13.440 --> 03:05:18.640]  were before. It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high
[03:05:18.640 --> 03:05:24.400]  tech book burning, isn't it? But I have joined my will to the resistance. I can't be destroyed
[03:05:24.400 --> 03:05:28.720]  now. As long as I realize I've done right, and as long as the people know the truth,
[03:05:28.720 --> 03:05:33.520]  and you can't be destroyed either. As long as you bind yourself to something and commit
[03:05:33.520 --> 03:05:38.400]  to it and go through the fire for it, there is a magic that then takes place, the transcend
[03:05:38.400 --> 03:05:42.720]  space and time. When you commit the award of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our
[03:05:42.720 --> 03:05:48.000]  articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing. So please now commit to
[03:05:48.000 --> 03:06:13.280]  support info wars, however you can, and realize your provision to info wars is your own provision.
[03:06:13.280 --> 03:06:22.800]  Here we are already Tuesday. It's amazing. Tuesday, March 5th, 2019. I'm your host Alex
[03:06:22.800 --> 03:06:28.560]  Jones here in the new studio. You've seen us do a lot of live reports and had political
[03:06:28.560 --> 03:06:34.280]  coverage of big events like state of the union here in our new state of the art studio. We've
[03:06:34.280 --> 03:06:39.480]  got three nice studios here now and are ready to start expanding to about 20 hours a day
[03:06:39.480 --> 03:06:43.800]  live. We're about six months behind getting that done because of all the obvious globalist
[03:06:43.800 --> 03:06:48.560]  attempts to shut us down and block us. But we are moving forward thanks to your prayers
[03:06:48.560 --> 03:06:54.040]  and thanks to your support. And quite frankly, we are now reaching just as many people as
[03:06:54.040 --> 03:07:00.640]  we ever did after all the enemy's attempts to shut us down and shut us up. It has backfired.
[03:07:00.640 --> 03:07:05.440]  We achieve Streisand effect. And now we're reaching an even wider new audience thanks
[03:07:05.440 --> 03:07:11.760]  to this core audience of activists taking action. And I thought I'd celebrate the new
[03:07:11.760 --> 03:07:17.400]  studio today by wearing a Stetson open road cowboy hat silver belly. This is the same
[03:07:17.400 --> 03:07:24.600]  hat my dad's dad wore his whole life than I knew him. And I got reminded that Paul Watson
[03:07:24.600 --> 03:07:28.520]  is here in town. And about it was like 15 years ago that Paul has a whole different
[03:07:28.520 --> 03:07:33.840]  personality when you put a cowboy hat on him. And so we're going to put a cowboy hat on
[03:07:33.840 --> 03:07:39.640]  him and get his great Texas imitation. But also a lot of other serious issues when he
[03:07:39.640 --> 03:07:44.720]  joins us at the waypoint at the midway point halfway into the broadcast in about an hour
[03:07:44.720 --> 03:07:51.760]  and 23 minutes from now. Faith Goldie is also in on fire, exposing the controlled globalist
[03:07:51.760 --> 03:07:56.400]  inside the Republican Party, one of the final obstacles to really defeating the NWO. She's
[03:07:56.400 --> 03:08:01.000]  going to be popping in and I tend to open the phones up as well. And then I will co host
[03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:07.520]  the war room with Owen Troyer three to six p.m. Today I will be on the second half with
[03:08:07.520 --> 03:08:13.080]  Paul Joseph Watson. We're going to have open phones and on Reddit ask us anything. I'm
[03:08:13.080 --> 03:08:17.920]  going to start a new system of ask me anything where you do it with two people, two different
[03:08:17.920 --> 03:08:21.760]  people and you ask two different interesting people questions and they have a discussion
[03:08:21.760 --> 03:08:25.920]  and they ask each other questions. Let's something I'm going to start. I'm going to start a podcast
[03:08:25.920 --> 03:08:30.840]  soon titled ask me anything where you have different guests on and you can ask them anything
[03:08:30.840 --> 03:08:36.520]  as well. So a lot of stuff about to happen here at Info Wars. Thanks to your prayers.
[03:08:36.520 --> 03:08:39.880]  Thanks to your support. Thanks to everything you do. And thanks to all the great AM and
[03:08:39.880 --> 03:08:44.320]  FM affiliates and TV affiliates as well. If you're listening one of those, please be
[03:08:44.320 --> 03:08:51.080]  sure and spread the word about those fine stations and support them. Okay. You know,
[03:08:51.080 --> 03:08:57.120]  I talked about this a couple years ago when they passed the law and they always pass draconian
[03:08:57.120 --> 03:09:04.440]  laws where they come into effect in a few years so that the public doesn't oppose them.
[03:09:04.440 --> 03:09:08.600]  People are very short-sighted. They're thinking in the moment, not long term, but exactly
[03:09:08.600 --> 03:09:12.320]  as we said, they would do it. They've done it. And if you sit back and think, how would
[03:09:12.320 --> 03:09:16.400]  you take over the Internet? How would you trick people to openly be surveilled? How
[03:09:16.400 --> 03:09:21.400]  would you trick people to be taxed to use the Internet more than they even do in communist
[03:09:21.400 --> 03:09:29.360]  China? How would you do that? Well, when you saw Pornhub and a couple of these other major
[03:09:29.360 --> 03:09:36.760]  sites, they get billions of views a month together at the heart of UN meetings and meetings
[03:09:36.760 --> 03:09:42.360]  with ICANN and meetings with big tech about how they were going to battle trafficking
[03:09:42.360 --> 03:09:48.200]  in humans and how they were going to empower women, you knew it was bad. So they signed
[03:09:48.200 --> 03:09:56.400]  on to ban free porn. Now, their sites will still be a mix of paid and, quote, free. But
[03:09:56.400 --> 03:10:00.800]  of course, if they've got more than half of the porn market, they want to be able to shut
[03:10:00.800 --> 03:10:05.480]  everybody else down. It's not about porn, though. They know that it'll get conservatives
[03:10:05.480 --> 03:10:09.840]  and Christians on board. And just like the British government, it's the only government
[03:10:09.840 --> 03:10:14.680]  in the world that has a paid television tax. Even if you don't own a television, they tax
[03:10:14.680 --> 03:10:20.760]  you up to 1,000 pounds a year. It's an outrageous amount of money. And they even have vans that
[03:10:20.760 --> 03:10:27.560]  drive around because any receiver also transmits, a tiny transmission, any receiver is also
[03:10:27.560 --> 03:10:32.840]  a transceiver. So they have vans that drive around with people picking up if you're watching
[03:10:32.840 --> 03:10:39.400]  television, not just BBC, but television, period. So there's a government tax to then
[03:10:39.400 --> 03:10:44.120]  fund propaganda. And that's what this is. So people look at the UK as such a free country.
[03:10:44.120 --> 03:10:48.920]  It's an outrageously unfree country. And so I'm going to break that down today in great
[03:10:48.920 --> 03:10:53.840]  detail. I apologize for watching on from the UK in studio to give a sistaic on it. But
[03:10:53.840 --> 03:11:00.600]  you see the dredgerport.com headline, the headlines on infowars.com as well. UK blocks
[03:11:00.600 --> 03:11:09.200]  all porn that's free or free porn blocked, free porn blocked in the UK. You go to infowars.com
[03:11:09.200 --> 03:11:18.200]  and we have the headline that the the national move in the UK to ban quote free porn is really
[03:11:18.200 --> 03:11:26.200]  an internet tax and internet tracking system. So this is it. This is the plan. And I told
[03:11:26.200 --> 03:11:31.480]  folks a couple years ago, when they were talking about it, that this is what's being implemented.
[03:11:31.480 --> 03:11:38.020]  But it's sold is just Oh, you pay the government. And then they put software on your computer
[03:11:38.020 --> 03:11:42.480]  that watches what you do and you give them your ID or passport. And now you can go look
[03:11:42.480 --> 03:11:46.640]  at any porn you want. So I'm going to say that again. The government is going to have
[03:11:46.640 --> 03:11:54.000]  a dossier. They already do. But publicly, you're going to opt into a dossier that knows
[03:11:54.000 --> 03:11:58.960]  what porn you're watching. So you and your wife at Saturday night, you go in, you turn
[03:11:58.960 --> 03:12:03.920]  on the television to dial into the internet and you pull up whatever your wife sent to.
[03:12:03.920 --> 03:12:09.800]  This is how it works. And now that you've got another partner in the bedroom with you,
[03:12:09.800 --> 03:12:14.880]  it's called the British government. But understand, it's coming here. This is the model. Everything
[03:12:14.880 --> 03:12:19.040]  done in China and England and Europe is the model. And they even admit the articles. They're
[03:12:19.040 --> 03:12:24.160]  like, this is for to make sure children don't look at it. And this is to make sure we keep
[03:12:24.160 --> 03:12:28.280]  everybody safe. And this is to make sure we can stop people being exploited. All that's
[03:12:28.280 --> 03:12:33.440]  made up the UN's running the kidnapping rings, all of it, the porn industry for anything
[03:12:33.440 --> 03:12:37.520]  you could say about it. I don't even defend it. It's very exploitive. Has has basically
[03:12:37.520 --> 03:12:41.320]  cleaned up its act under lawsuits and disease. And it's very exploitive and evil. And I'm
[03:12:41.320 --> 03:12:47.080]  not defending it. But any claims that the government of the UK or the US government
[03:12:47.080 --> 03:12:51.000]  or anybody's trying to defend kids from porn is asinine because I've got stories right
[03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:58.160]  here in my stack. Aggressive promotion of homosexuality. School stops LGBT lesson after
[03:12:58.160 --> 03:13:03.440]  backlash from angry angry parents being reported by the Daily Mail by RT and others. And you
[03:13:03.440 --> 03:13:07.280]  learn it's Muslim. So say what you want about Muslims who throw gaze off buildings and cut
[03:13:07.280 --> 03:13:12.600]  women's genitals off. I disagree with that. I'm a libertarian. But I don't think you should
[03:13:12.600 --> 03:13:18.880]  have LGBT sexualizing kids. That's the pedophile side of that, which some groups are officially
[03:13:18.880 --> 03:13:25.080]  adopting the P now saying yes, we are a pedophilia. And so that was in the congressional report
[03:13:25.080 --> 03:13:29.000]  five years ago. The Democrats wanted all this. The same thing's happened in the UK. It's
[03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:34.960]  a unified concerted effort. So they're sexualizing children. They've got drag kid things at school.
[03:13:34.960 --> 03:13:38.480]  They have drag queens coming and telling your five year old son that they're really a girl.
[03:13:38.480 --> 03:13:42.120]  I mean, if that happened at the park, you'd go to jail. If a man walked over at the park,
[03:13:42.120 --> 03:13:44.840]  while you're sitting there grilling hamburgers and said, I'm going to teach your daughter
[03:13:44.840 --> 03:13:50.120]  and your son about sex, they'd be arrested as being a pervert. But now it's done officially
[03:13:50.120 --> 03:13:54.600]  by the school. It's OK. So meanwhile, just today, you've got massive arrest of giant
[03:13:54.600 --> 03:13:59.760]  Islamic grooming gangs of little girls. And then you've got the leftist ally with radical
[03:13:59.760 --> 03:14:03.320]  Islam saying, come on in, do whatever you want. But now the Muslims are saying, hey,
[03:14:03.320 --> 03:14:07.520]  I'm going to teach my five year old how to have a blow job. It's what they teach in UK
[03:14:07.520 --> 03:14:13.240]  schools, or that he's going to put a dress on him. And so now the left saying it's OK.
[03:14:13.240 --> 03:14:17.120]  Muslims can opt out, but no one else can. And you'll be arrested if you're not a Muslim.
[03:14:17.120 --> 03:14:22.440]  So see, this is how the whole leftist system works, total and complete tyranny show when
[03:14:22.440 --> 03:14:29.080]  the UK, quote, blocks porn that is, quote, free. What they're saying is the tens of thousands
[03:14:29.080 --> 03:14:34.560]  of other sites, or now they're even going to go Puritan on you, Puritanical, and say
[03:14:34.560 --> 03:14:40.640]  even showing breast, Shafqor is now regulated. So now if you want to watch an R rated movie,
[03:14:40.640 --> 03:14:43.560]  you're going to have to opt into a government database and agree to be tracked. That's the
[03:14:43.560 --> 03:14:49.520]  secret of the global social credit score that gets you to opt in. It's outrageous. So all
[03:14:49.520 --> 03:14:54.160]  the other sites can be shut down, all the other sites can be blocked, and only the two big
[03:14:54.160 --> 03:14:58.960]  porn sites that account for half the porn visits in the world. Well, of course, therefore
[03:14:58.960 --> 03:15:05.800]  this porn hub and you porn. Now, now because this is much bigger than all the TV networks
[03:15:05.800 --> 03:15:10.880]  and all the media in the world combined, it's now going to be regulated and turned into
[03:15:10.880 --> 03:15:16.600]  one homogenized controlled combine, which is what it's always been about. That's what
[03:15:16.600 --> 03:15:20.880]  internet regulation is about. It's what the attacks on talk radio, the attacks on Alex
[03:15:20.880 --> 03:15:25.120]  Jones, the attacks on free speech, because once they can ban me, they can ban you. And
[03:15:25.120 --> 03:15:30.120]  once they can say, Oh, you have a government device and software, it watches what porn
[03:15:30.120 --> 03:15:35.640]  you're watching, and you pay a government license to go watch pornography from around
[03:15:35.640 --> 03:15:41.120]  the world. Think about that. That is so diabolical. It's so evil. And it's the left doing in the
[03:15:41.120 --> 03:15:44.840]  name of protecting children. When they're the ones that are about your pedophilic perverts
[03:15:44.840 --> 03:15:49.080]  trying to get a hold of your kids and literally teach them how to be perverts, we'll be right
[03:15:49.080 --> 03:15:50.600]  back. Stay with us.
[03:15:50.600 --> 03:15:57.240]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize
[03:15:57.240 --> 03:16:01.800]  my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating
[03:16:01.800 --> 03:16:05.840]  them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people

[03:16:22.920 --> 03:16:28.280]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[03:16:28.280 --> 03:16:33.360]  the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of
[03:16:33.360 --> 03:16:40.200]  Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken. Its former colony, the U.S.,
[03:16:40.200 --> 03:16:45.800]  had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began
[03:16:45.800 --> 03:16:52.560]  with World War I, the United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.

[03:19:57.280 --> 03:20:15.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:15.520 --> 03:20:31.560]  We're listening to Republic from Enemies, Born and Domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:31.560 --> 03:20:50.320]  I didn't tell you I was going on Joe Rogan. We just snuck attack. And I can tell you there's
[03:20:50.320 --> 03:20:56.040]  a bunch of other snake attacks coming very soon, just as big or bigger. Talk to Joe
[03:20:56.040 --> 03:21:02.560]  some this morning. It is undoubtedly with analytics, the biggest podcast he's ever done.
[03:21:02.560 --> 03:21:06.280]  And the last one I did was number three. It was number one until Elon Musk and a few others.
[03:21:06.280 --> 03:21:13.960]  Now it's number one, only six days in. In fact, we're expecting by tomorrow night it
[03:21:13.960 --> 03:21:20.040]  will have at least 30 million views between YouTube and iTunes. Right now it's over 20
[03:21:20.040 --> 03:21:25.000]  million total. And that's with Google not letting it trend and blocking it. Remember
[03:21:25.000 --> 03:21:38.840]  that. Now let me make the big announcement here. Okay. Internet ID. Let me make the
[03:21:38.840 --> 03:21:50.560]  big announcement here. Internet ID. Internet regulation, internet tracking is here. And
[03:21:50.560 --> 03:21:57.680]  it's being done under the auspice of, quote, blocking free porn. The UK has now passed
[03:21:57.680 --> 03:22:05.080]  law that has implemented April 1st that only the two big porn companies, Porn Hub and
[03:22:05.080 --> 03:22:11.080]  U-Porn will be the only sites you can visit. Everything else you've got to go through
[03:22:11.080 --> 03:22:15.480]  a government database, give them a passport or an ID, log into a government database
[03:22:15.480 --> 03:22:21.240]  so they can track what you do and then pay them money so that you have the right to go
[03:22:21.240 --> 03:22:29.480]  look at pornography. So just like George Arwell predicted in 1984, the government is going
[03:22:29.480 --> 03:22:35.880]  to be in charge of pornography for control and debasement of the population. This has
[03:22:35.880 --> 03:22:39.680]  nothing to do with stopping pornography. It has nothing to do with stopping the targeting
[03:22:39.680 --> 03:22:45.920]  of children. It's mainstream media. It's cartoons. It's the public schools. It's all of them
[03:22:45.920 --> 03:22:52.760]  that are totally and completely obsessed with sexualizing children. And now that the government
[03:22:52.760 --> 03:22:59.080]  is going to be involved with all these fat checking groups and leftist groups like Hope
[03:22:59.080 --> 03:23:06.080]  Not Hate and the Southern Poverty Law Center and Media Matters, they're going to be in
[03:23:06.080 --> 03:23:11.760]  the history of the supposed porn you're visiting. And don't think this is just going to end
[03:23:11.760 --> 03:23:16.720]  in the UK. They admit with the major porn companies who want their competition shut
[03:23:16.720 --> 03:23:23.080]  down. This is total racketeering. This is total antitrust. They admit that they want
[03:23:23.080 --> 03:23:30.560]  their competition shut down. So they're partnering with government to control and track who
[03:23:30.560 --> 03:23:38.360]  looks at porn webcams, what movies you watch, what you do, and even soft core pornography
[03:23:38.360 --> 03:23:43.240]  will now be tracked in a government database. Think about how the IRS abused tens of thousands
[03:23:43.240 --> 03:23:47.720]  of Christians and conservatives and libertarians under Obama and no one got in trouble with
[03:23:47.720 --> 03:23:53.760]  Lawrence Lerner. Think about all the incredible abuses they've been involved with the databases
[03:23:53.760 --> 03:23:58.880]  and leftist doxing people and using where you live and where you go to school and where
[03:23:58.880 --> 03:24:04.800]  you work to get you fired if you're a Trump supporter. And then imagine, you got to take
[03:24:04.800 --> 03:24:08.400]  your hat off to them to come up with something like this, that they would try to get away
[03:24:08.400 --> 03:24:15.200]  with this in 2019 and then just, oh, it's just a law to protect kids. You've got to
[03:24:15.200 --> 03:24:20.840]  pay a government fee. You've got to then be tracked and then the government of course
[03:24:20.840 --> 03:24:27.680]  can easily go in anytime they want and they can add whatever disinformation they want
[03:24:27.680 --> 03:24:33.920]  to the database of supposed porn that you visited. Because in blackmail and control,
[03:24:33.920 --> 03:24:39.120]  people's sexual proclivity, people's sexual activity are their big, dark secrets. And
[03:24:39.120 --> 03:24:44.680]  now the UK government, the kings of blackmail, the kings of pedophilia, the kings of using
[03:24:44.680 --> 03:24:49.760]  sex to control populations and governments are now saying, oh, by the way, you visit
[03:24:49.760 --> 03:24:55.520]  any major porn site, you've got to have a government license, you've got to give a
[03:24:55.520 --> 03:24:59.760]  sure ID, you've got to be in a database, you've got to have our software on your computer
[03:24:59.760 --> 03:25:04.400]  that will have trusted groups like Hope Not Hate and the Southern Poverty Law Center and
[03:25:04.400 --> 03:25:10.800]  others inside your computer. George Soros funded groups just like News Guard is now on all
[03:25:10.800 --> 03:25:15.240]  the Microsoft operating systems and browsers. And it's going to move on. They're saying
[03:25:15.240 --> 03:25:20.760]  the next few months to Apple and to Google and to Android and to the phones. And then
[03:25:20.760 --> 03:25:26.640]  now when you visit a site, it's not going to be on the site that, oh, don't listen to
[03:25:26.640 --> 03:25:30.760]  Alex Jones, here's some fact checking, whether they misrepresent what we've said and done
[03:25:30.760 --> 03:25:35.480]  and then fact check the straw man. No, it's on your phone, it's on your desktop. They're
[03:25:35.480 --> 03:25:40.160]  in your phone, you're in your desktop watching what you do in real time, telling you, oh,
[03:25:40.160 --> 03:25:44.240]  this is dangerous or oh, this is bad or oh, you could have your credit score lowered, you
[03:25:44.240 --> 03:25:49.200]  could get in trouble, you're looking at illegal content. So it's multi prompt. They've got
[03:25:49.200 --> 03:25:53.360]  the leftist fact checkers and the universities and the intelligence agencies already plugged
[03:25:53.360 --> 03:25:59.800]  into Microsoft and looking at what you're saying and looking at what you're doing. And
[03:25:59.800 --> 03:26:07.600]  the neocons run News Guard. And then you've got over here the left going, oh, no one wants
[03:26:07.600 --> 03:26:11.560]  to pay their BBC fee anymore of a thousand pounds a year or whatever it is. Look up what
[03:26:11.560 --> 03:26:20.160]  the BBC yearly charges. Look that up for me real quick. Look up the BBC yearly charge
[03:26:20.160 --> 03:26:27.680]  for me because I want to get that looked at right now. I want to do that. So imagine they
[03:26:27.680 --> 03:26:33.600]  started this back in the 40s after World War Two and they said, everybody that has a television,
[03:26:33.600 --> 03:26:36.240]  you've got to pay a tax. And then even if you didn't have a television, they said, well,
[03:26:36.240 --> 03:26:39.800]  you may be looking at your neighbor's TV, so you're going to pay this big giant tax.
[03:26:39.800 --> 03:26:42.800]  Now, it used to be up to a thousand pounds, but now no one would pay it. So they lowered
[03:26:42.800 --> 03:26:51.160]  it to 147 to 150 pounds. So what is that $200 a year? But again, the key here isn't the
[03:26:51.160 --> 03:26:55.480]  money. It's with the internet. They can track what you're looking at and what you're doing.
[03:26:55.480 --> 03:27:00.680]  And they think the subservient, client population will accept it, but there's work. It's worse.
[03:27:00.680 --> 03:27:10.000]  Now it turns loose. The taxing authority, they have their IRS over there by another name,
[03:27:10.000 --> 03:27:15.600]  like their inland revenue inside the empire revenue. And now they're going to have an
[03:27:15.600 --> 03:27:21.400]  excuse to raid you to see that you were looking at porn that wasn't authorized and wasn't
[03:27:21.400 --> 03:27:24.680]  put through a government filter. I'm going to say it again. The government is going to
[03:27:24.680 --> 03:27:29.800]  run worldwide the production and the distribution because that's how this works. Once you take
[03:27:29.800 --> 03:27:33.600]  control of the regulatory power of something, you will then inevitably become the producer,
[03:27:33.600 --> 03:27:37.640]  the director. You will be the person making the money. So governments are now always
[03:27:37.640 --> 03:27:42.280]  horning in on Hollywood and the theater and entertainment and having a merger of that
[03:27:42.280 --> 03:27:48.280]  in any fascist or communist system. But now they'll be directly in control of pornography.
[03:27:48.280 --> 03:27:53.200]  And the top pornography producers are all lined up as shooters to government because
[03:27:53.200 --> 03:27:59.360]  the internet decentralized porn and took the money out of it. All the way now to the only
[03:27:59.360 --> 03:28:04.280]  way you make money in porn, if you read the expert analysis is individual to individual
[03:28:04.280 --> 03:28:10.320]  like prostitution, where women and men are doing webcams and giving people personal attention.
[03:28:10.320 --> 03:28:16.240]  So it's evolved or devolved now back to closer to real sex away from the big cookie cutter
[03:28:16.240 --> 03:28:21.840]  mass production of the 1960s and 1970s where there were porn movies making as much money
[03:28:21.840 --> 03:28:27.480]  as major Hollywood movies, tens of millions of dollars. That's all decentralized and destroyed.
[03:28:27.480 --> 03:28:32.800]  So now you have the perfect storm. Now you have the perfect storm of the big porn companies
[03:28:32.800 --> 03:28:36.920]  collapsing, government wanting to know what you're watching and doing, global government,
[03:28:36.920 --> 03:28:41.880]  internet ID, global social score coming together in England. The UK is the launch point for
[03:28:41.880 --> 03:28:47.200]  total surveillance of everything. And it's coming here. Make no mistake. When we return,
[03:28:47.200 --> 03:28:53.640]  Google just got caught lying about dragonfly and mass spying.
[03:28:53.640 --> 03:28:58.600]  Disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[03:28:58.600 --> 03:29:03.400]  may not be fully detected by you. But the symptoms are there. Loss of energy, blood
[03:29:03.400 --> 03:29:08.120]  sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of
[03:29:08.120 --> 03:29:12.560]  these that can alert you that something is wrong. Here how heart and body extract is
[03:29:12.560 --> 03:29:17.600]  making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America. My blood pressure has
[03:29:17.600 --> 03:29:22.480]  normalized. My diabetes has totally improved. Everyone is telling me now how much healthier

[03:30:54.120 --> 03:30:58.480]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or
[03:30:58.480 --> 03:31:03.800]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk. Believe me, I know.
[03:31:03.800 --> 03:31:08.680]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.

[03:32:57.280 --> 03:33:09.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Over 20 years ago, Alex Jones created the
[03:33:09.680 --> 03:33:14.800]  media platform called InforWars. And in the decade since, it's grown into a truly
[03:33:14.800 --> 03:33:20.400]  remarkable institution with over 200 radio affiliates, tens of millions of unique website
[03:33:20.400 --> 03:33:25.480]  visitors monthly, and a 24 seven live news TV channel broadcasting from state of the
[03:33:25.480 --> 03:33:30.840]  art studios in Austin, Texas. InforWars has become the most trusted independent news source
[03:33:30.840 --> 03:33:36.040]  in the country dedicated to delivering breaking news, live coverage of special events and
[03:33:36.040 --> 03:33:41.480]  exclusive reports you won't find anywhere else. While the old guard media struggles
[03:33:41.480 --> 03:33:46.880]  to maintain supremacy in a landscape brought by innovation and technology, InforWars has
[03:33:46.880 --> 03:33:53.440]  been at the forefront of the information revolution. From 8 million radio listeners, over 2 million
[03:33:53.440 --> 03:33:59.440]  YouTube subscribers, or the billions of views of our online content, InforWars proves dominant
[03:33:59.440 --> 03:34:06.120]  in every facet of media we enter. For the hardest hitting reports, uncompromising analysis

[03:34:42.680 --> 03:35:02.320]  Show in 2017, we have states passing laws to kill babies that are totally healthy and
[03:35:02.320 --> 03:35:09.400]  already outside the womb. In 2019, they're teaching five-year-olds and four-year-olds
[03:35:09.400 --> 03:35:14.480]  in the U.K. and Canada and the U.S. that little boys are really little girls and little girls
[03:35:14.480 --> 03:35:19.740]  are really little boys. Serious psychological abuse beyond sexual abuse, trying to literally
[03:35:19.740 --> 03:35:24.240]  destroy their identity. Something that if parents did it, they should be arrested. But
[03:35:24.240 --> 03:35:35.760]  the school does it, it's okay. And now, U.K. porn block starts April 1st, but you can unlock
[03:35:35.760 --> 03:35:49.080]  it by handing over ID or buying a five-pound porn card. So you pay like $7. And then the
[03:35:49.080 --> 03:35:54.200]  government tracks everything you do and has your ID and your name. And then the government
[03:35:54.200 --> 03:35:57.720]  knows what you're watching and what you're doing. This is so creepy. This is so sick.
[03:35:57.720 --> 03:36:02.440]  The government is now a voyeur, a pimp in your bedroom. And of course, it comes from
[03:36:02.440 --> 03:36:10.320]  the left to protect the children, of course. Watching Free Porn in Britain is about to
[03:36:10.320 --> 03:36:16.360]  get a lot trickier, thanks to new rules that aim to protect children from online smite.
[03:36:16.360 --> 03:36:20.440]  Yeah, we don't want kids to be hateful beggars. Let's teach them to be sexualized at age
[03:36:20.440 --> 03:36:24.760]  five. These be called pedophilia, not called liberal. As early as next month, porn sites
[03:36:24.760 --> 03:36:31.240]  will be required to get proof of ID from U.K. residents before showing any X-rated clips.
[03:36:31.240 --> 03:36:35.120]  There's free porn sites like Porn Hub and U-Porn who don't want there to be competition
[03:36:35.120 --> 03:36:39.680]  and want you to have to register, which is tracking only two billion visits a month between
[03:36:39.680 --> 03:36:43.440]  them worldwide and know they're going to make 100 times more money with the government
[03:36:43.440 --> 03:36:47.720]  who they lobby to do this. That's right. The big porn sites did this to create a monopoly.
[03:36:47.720 --> 03:36:53.480]  Those want a number of other sites and using age ID system, which requires users to verify
[03:36:53.480 --> 03:36:58.880]  their age via an official form of ID, which is a driver's license or passport. So you're
[03:36:58.880 --> 03:37:03.760]  not getting into a hotel or passing a port. You're going to go watch whatever and now
[03:37:03.760 --> 03:37:07.520]  the government's going to be there with a record of it. From April, when the new system
[03:37:07.520 --> 03:37:13.680]  is expected to launch, Randy Internet Lurkers will be shown a non-pornographic landing page
[03:37:13.680 --> 03:37:21.160]  according to age ID spokesman James Clark. When a user first visits a site protected
[03:37:21.160 --> 03:37:26.560]  by age ID, a landing page will appear with a prompt for the user to verify their age
[03:37:26.560 --> 03:37:32.560]  before they can access the site, he told Demetra. Each website will create their own non-pornographic
[03:37:32.560 --> 03:37:36.360]  landing page. When someone first clicks the site, they'll be asked to register with age
[03:37:36.360 --> 03:37:42.560]  ID to verify their age using a mobile SMZM's credit card or passport or driver's license.
[03:37:42.560 --> 03:37:47.640]  This is the Internet ID, Internet taxation, Internet regulation. Users will then be able
[03:37:47.640 --> 03:37:53.040]  to use the age ID user name or password attached to your driver's license, your passport the
[03:37:53.040 --> 03:37:57.960]  government has, to access all porn sites that use age ID, although some may use different
[03:37:57.960 --> 03:38:04.080]  verification systems. Clark said it's a one-time verification with a simple sign in for future
[03:38:04.080 --> 03:38:08.680]  access. If a user verifies with the age ID protected site, they'll not need to perform
[03:38:08.680 --> 03:38:14.120]  the verification age or any other site carrying age ID. And again, this is going to be used
[03:38:14.120 --> 03:38:18.600]  against everybody else to shut them down. This is the global ID, folks, the global Internet
[03:38:18.600 --> 03:38:22.000]  ID, the Holy Grail of Surveillance and Control. The new rules will have proved as part of
[03:38:22.000 --> 03:38:27.320]  the Digital Economy Act two years ago. They aim to make it harder for under-18s to get
[03:38:27.320 --> 03:38:30.920]  a hold of adult material. No, that's going on in the schools. As well as registering
[03:38:30.920 --> 03:38:35.500]  with age ID, Brits will also be able to access porn sites using a voucher you can buy from
[03:38:35.500 --> 03:38:40.800]  high-streep shops. This is that nice. Thousands of shops will offer the special IDs which
[03:38:40.800 --> 03:38:46.800]  users can link to an app known as Portals. And then it goes on to say you can also buy
[03:38:46.800 --> 03:38:52.800]  a government ID and go to the government system. So there you go. And it's all tracked by the
[03:38:52.800 --> 03:38:56.960]  government. So they got you to opt in. Like, the government's not spying. Okay, they are.
[03:38:56.960 --> 03:39:00.560]  But you know what? We just need you to opt in so we can do it because it's illegal to
[03:39:00.560 --> 03:39:05.960]  spy on you. But now we're going to do it openly. And then meanwhile, I mentioned this article
[03:39:05.960 --> 03:39:11.960]  earlier, Aggressive Promotion of Homosexuality called pedophilia when the darker kids. School
[03:39:11.960 --> 03:39:17.280]  stops LGBT lessons at their backlash from angry parents. And when you read the articles
[03:39:17.280 --> 03:39:24.280]  in RT or the Daily Mail, it's, oh, it's Muslims. They're upset that there's grown adults talking
[03:39:24.280 --> 03:39:28.040]  to their five-year-old sons and daughters about their sexual preference because kids
[03:39:28.040 --> 03:39:31.080]  aren't thinking about that. I mean, if a dad or mom started asking their five-year-old
[03:39:31.080 --> 03:39:37.440]  about, have you heard about sadomasochism? Have you heard about sex changes in children?
[03:39:37.440 --> 03:39:40.920]  Have you heard about fisting? This is what they teach five-year-olds. And the kids are
[03:39:40.920 --> 03:39:46.280]  like, what? And they're just totally screwing them up. I mean, it's irreverable pedophilic
[03:39:46.280 --> 03:39:52.320]  assault, but it's all done by the leftist social engineers, so it's all A-OK. And it
[03:39:52.320 --> 03:39:58.520]  continues. School forced in LGBT lessons by outraged Muslim parents. So, yeah, the pedophiles
[03:39:58.520 --> 03:40:02.680]  are worse than even Orthodox Islam, even though there's a lot of pedophilia in Islam.
[03:40:02.680 --> 03:40:08.520]  A primary school in Birmingham, England, has halted LGBT lessons for 600 victims. They
[03:40:08.520 --> 03:40:13.560]  call them pupils were reportedly taken out of class by furious Muslim parents upset at
[03:40:13.560 --> 03:40:18.520]  homosexuals being aggressively taught to their children, homosexuality. Parkville Community
[03:40:18.520 --> 03:40:27.120]  School had been forced to suspend its no-outsiders classes until Easter while a consultation
[03:40:27.120 --> 03:40:31.360]  takes place with parents. Tensions between the school and parents has escalated due to
[03:40:31.360 --> 03:40:37.840]  a fight surrounding LGBT lifestyles being taught in classrooms. The ill feeling from
[03:40:37.840 --> 03:40:44.280]  angry parents was even boiled over into threats against the assistant headteacher, Andrew
[03:40:44.280 --> 03:40:51.560]  Moffat, MBA, who is gay. He claims to have received nasty emails, including one which
[03:40:51.560 --> 03:40:57.040]  he said wouldn't last too long. And it goes on from there. The primary school, which is
[03:40:57.040 --> 03:41:01.920]  around seven and 20 victims, is located in the predominantly Muslim area. It has come
[03:41:01.920 --> 03:41:07.160]  under fire from Muslim parents for implementing the LGBT program, which seeks to challenge
[03:41:07.160 --> 03:41:12.680]  homophobia because homosexuality is strictly forbidden in Islam. According to Alam Rock
[03:41:12.680 --> 03:41:17.960]  Community Forum, children were removed from classes over the school's undermining of
[03:41:17.960 --> 03:41:22.400]  parental rights and aggressively promoting homosexuality, which is the total goal. The
[03:41:22.400 --> 03:41:28.920]  forum added that despite repeated petitions, protest, and dialogue integrated by parents,
[03:41:28.920 --> 03:41:33.280]  they have been arrogantly ignored because a pedophile can't control themselves. They
[03:41:33.280 --> 03:41:38.880]  will have their way with children until you lock them up or until they are executed.
[03:41:38.880 --> 03:41:44.760]  Everyone that used to be radical to say execute pedophiles, now it's like those are good people.
[03:41:44.760 --> 03:41:49.600]  Don't you try to do that? That you can't allow that to go on. So they're not trying
[03:41:49.600 --> 03:41:55.960]  to protect children in the pedophile run, demonic command base of the United Kingdom.
[03:41:55.960 --> 03:42:00.000]  They are using what they've already done to then come in and try to get their mittens
[03:42:00.000 --> 03:42:04.800]  on everybody else's sexual activity or porn viewing. They already have it. They want to
[03:42:04.800 --> 03:42:10.120]  use it. They just want to legitimize that you opted into this and then demonize anybody
[03:42:10.120 --> 03:42:14.000]  else that doesn't sign up with the government to tell them where they went and what they
[03:42:14.000 --> 03:42:19.520]  did. They're training you to opt in to your own slavery. Now, I think I've spent enough
[03:42:19.520 --> 03:42:26.960]  time on that, haven't I? So when we come back, fountain of youth, scientists switch off gene
[03:42:26.960 --> 03:42:31.000]  to double lifespan. Also, U.S. death from alcohol, drugs and suicide at the highest
[03:42:31.000 --> 03:42:37.560]  levels ever recorded. And we're going to get into the big news. AOC. Vanessa Susan went
[03:42:37.560 --> 03:42:42.240]  to prison for $27,000. They said it was illegal. He gave to a friend running for the Senate.
[03:42:42.240 --> 03:42:48.040]  But in the very same state and very same district, they're saying AOC who raised 18 million, most
[03:42:48.040 --> 03:42:53.040]  of it illegal can keep the millions. That's right. She's above the law. She's a good,
[03:42:53.040 --> 03:43:01.760]  dirty coming. X2 is back. The original X2, deep breath crystal, pure atomic iodine, what

[03:43:07.840 --> 03:43:12.440]  The best iodine in the world. X2, it's available. I thought X3 is great. We still got another
[03:43:12.440 --> 03:43:16.160]  deep breath crystal source, but I thought add the other two types of iodine. The scientists
[03:43:16.160 --> 03:43:21.400]  said do that. It sold a lot that people want original X2. I was resigned the fact we didn't
[03:43:21.400 --> 03:43:27.000]  have X2, but it came through about a month ago. We now have X2 again in FullWareStore.com.
[03:43:27.000 --> 03:43:32.360]  So hallelujah. It's been sold out for about almost three months. We have now had the same

[03:47:11.060 --> 03:47:37.060]  Live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:37.060 --> 03:47:46.540]  Well I'm going to say it right now on air. I take my hat off to the Islamic Muslim community
[03:47:46.540 --> 03:47:53.140]  of the UK because they're the only groups consistently protesting and saying no to children
[03:47:53.140 --> 03:47:58.260]  as young as three years of age being taught that they are sexually active, that boys are
[03:47:58.260 --> 03:48:04.740]  girls, that girls are boys and they've been protesting and saying no to the pedophile
[03:48:04.740 --> 03:48:14.860]  cult that runs the UK and so I salute the Muslims in the UK for being better people
[03:48:14.860 --> 03:48:19.180]  than the average British citizen and better than the police and better than the government
[03:48:19.180 --> 03:48:22.940]  that's run by pedophiles because as bad as radical Islam is and as bad as the horrible
[03:48:22.940 --> 03:48:27.500]  things you do are and you're grooming gangs and all the rest of it you're at least saying
[03:48:27.500 --> 03:48:31.820]  let's just kidnap 13 year old girls and turn them into sex slaves which is terrible but
[03:48:31.820 --> 03:48:37.340]  you're not saying let's teach three, four and five year olds the same stuff so in the
[03:48:37.340 --> 03:48:42.860]  whole spectrum of evil in the UK I have to say radical Islam and the Muslims are now
[03:48:42.860 --> 03:48:48.580]  better and we just covered that in the last segment how they are radically brainwashing
[03:48:48.580 --> 03:48:52.100]  children, how they're telling boys they're really girls, girls are really boys, they're
[03:48:52.100 --> 03:48:56.740]  sexualizing them, they're abusing them, it's pedophilia and the Muslims have come out and
[03:48:56.740 --> 03:49:01.700]  said it's wrong and are the people standing up and I know there's been the golden age
[03:49:01.700 --> 03:49:05.260]  of Islam and I know there's been Islamic countries and nations that were actually open and free
[03:49:05.260 --> 03:49:09.780]  during different parts of civilization but the current one run by the al-Qaeda, Wahhabi
[03:49:09.780 --> 03:49:15.660]  and Saudi Arabia is pure evil but I would welcome Islam to reform itself and then team
[03:49:15.660 --> 03:49:20.940]  up with the West to try to stand up against satanic activity but right now the left is
[03:49:20.940 --> 03:49:24.700]  in love with Islam because they think you're against Christianity so they've made a deal
[03:49:24.700 --> 03:49:28.900]  with you but now the left doesn't want to know what to do because Islam is standing
[03:49:28.900 --> 03:49:34.140]  in the way of the left perverting five-year-old children.
[03:49:34.140 --> 03:49:39.020]  So this is quite a conundrum, quite a paradox that we're going to be discussing but I take
[03:49:39.020 --> 03:49:46.660]  my hand off to the Muslims of the UK out of the giant rotting filthy capitulated passed
[03:49:46.660 --> 03:49:53.300]  out submissive demonic drunken island of all the rotten parts of the fish, I guess
[03:49:53.300 --> 03:49:58.980]  you're the least rotten, I have to say it, maybe the UK will be liberated by Islam.
[03:49:58.980 --> 03:50:04.860]  I mean they still have a lot of child kidnapping and a lot of six slaves but they kind of stop
[03:50:04.860 --> 03:50:12.260]  at 12-year-olds and so maybe we're being liberated by Islam actually because the left is even
[03:50:12.260 --> 03:50:15.860]  worse than radical Islam and I'll just go ahead and say it and I kind of been having
[03:50:15.860 --> 03:50:21.860]  this epiphany because the Christians won't say a damn thing in the UK, okay let's stop
[03:50:21.860 --> 03:50:26.380]  right there.
[03:50:26.380 --> 03:50:32.820]  The next thing I'm going to get to is so big that I really don't want to just put it out
[03:50:32.820 --> 03:50:37.260]  there and not give it the attention it deserves but I'm going to do it because my brain thinks
[03:50:37.260 --> 03:50:41.780]  a little bit different than a lot of people's and I always kind of have a memory and I think
[03:50:41.780 --> 03:50:51.220]  about how it connects to things and how it ties into other events that have unfolded
[03:50:51.220 --> 03:50:58.260]  and so yeah, everybody's really excited right now that AOC, the meth mouth, the creature
[03:50:58.260 --> 03:51:04.420]  from the methamphetamine lagoon, everyone is just so excited that she didn't steal
[03:51:04.420 --> 03:51:08.420]  a million, she didn't steal two million, I went in this morning when I saw it into the
[03:51:08.420 --> 03:51:16.580]  SEC records and the Federal Election Commission records and that's why she ended up running,
[03:51:16.580 --> 03:51:22.140]  she was a front person for Soros money and didn't just get 18 million, we found other
[03:51:22.140 --> 03:51:26.620]  packs, you'll hear about those the next few days, of course her and her business manager
[03:51:26.620 --> 03:51:33.540]  pocketed millions, totally illegal but when you're a Democrat you're allowed to do it
[03:51:33.540 --> 03:51:44.380]  so the rest of the story here in just a moment, that said, we have some big specials that
[03:51:44.380 --> 03:51:50.100]  are going to be ending this week that are some of the biggest specials we've ever had
[03:51:50.100 --> 03:51:56.860]  and are products that if you're a man particularly, you're insane if you're not taking.
[03:51:56.860 --> 03:52:01.740]  I set out with top developers, this is products put out about two years, took about a year
[03:52:01.740 --> 03:52:06.580]  to get it done and I said, I see all these testosterone boasters and all these other
[03:52:06.580 --> 03:52:11.340]  libido boasters and I know that the industry marks things up seven times on average, I
[03:52:11.340 --> 03:52:15.460]  just want to mark it up 150% and I want to take most of the money and put it into the
[03:52:15.460 --> 03:52:20.420]  product instead of having $2 a product, I want to have $10, $15 a product in it and
[03:52:20.420 --> 03:52:24.700]  companies go, no one's ever done that, no one does that, usually the container, the
[03:52:24.700 --> 03:52:29.500]  bottle is more cost than what's in it and herbs and stuff that God gave us are so incredible
[03:52:29.500 --> 03:52:34.500]  it still blows people away and that's where all the modern drugs and all that stuff comes
[03:52:34.500 --> 03:52:40.100]  from is copying what's in plants, what's in herbs, what's in minerals, what's in compounds.
[03:52:40.100 --> 03:52:49.340]  So I set out with this product, Alpha Power, to produce something that is the strongest
[03:52:49.340 --> 03:52:58.660]  libido, stamina, energy, sports, natural, healthy enhancer that you can get.
[03:52:58.660 --> 03:53:05.220]  You can pay $100 for something that isn't as good and it's usually a great deal at $69.
[03:53:05.220 --> 03:53:12.420]  It's $34.95 right now, it's 50% off and we've got a combo deal going where you can give
[03:53:12.420 --> 03:53:19.300]  it the strength and recovery combo, you can get it with bodies, ultimate turmeric formula
[03:53:19.300 --> 03:53:24.020]  and again, the average turmeric formula, it's so hard to isolate and it's so powerful,
[03:53:24.020 --> 03:53:26.820]  it's three to five percent, they know you're getting a result with that.
[03:53:26.820 --> 03:53:30.700]  I said, is it safe to give them the strongest available and they said, well, no one's done
[03:53:30.700 --> 03:53:36.460]  it, maybe other top browns are, 80%, they said, no one else does that, a couple brands
[03:53:36.460 --> 03:53:44.100]  of 80%, they said, our chemists can give you 95%, this is tested, curcuminoid and I said,
[03:53:44.100 --> 03:53:46.300]  I want 95% curcuminoid.
[03:53:46.300 --> 03:53:51.140]  So our turmeric is fresh and organic and there's an extraction, patented process, we've got
[03:53:51.140 --> 03:53:57.740]  to pay a lot of money for where it's 95% curcuminoid, if you don't know what that means, it's insane.
[03:53:57.740 --> 03:54:03.220]  I personally, if I take a leave, I get incredible heartburn and I feel horrible, Advil works
[03:54:03.220 --> 03:54:04.220]  really great for me.
[03:54:04.220 --> 03:54:09.380]  It's a great product and I'm not comparing it to a drug, I'm just telling you personally,
[03:54:09.380 --> 03:54:11.660]  I don't take that now.
[03:54:11.660 --> 03:54:16.580]  I take a couple of bodies when I sprain an ankle or something happens and it's way better
[03:54:16.580 --> 03:54:24.100]  for me personally, just experience it for yourself what Mother Nature gave us, curcuminoid.
[03:54:24.100 --> 03:54:29.380]  Everybody knows it is curry, but the chemical in curry is curcuminoid.
[03:54:29.380 --> 03:54:32.820]  Everybody knows how good, there's a little sprinkle of curry on that Indian food or that
[03:54:32.820 --> 03:54:38.020]  Chinese food, it's like, so good, like hot food, this is concentrated hundreds and hundreds
[03:54:38.020 --> 03:54:40.780]  of times you're going to get in that meal.
[03:54:40.780 --> 03:54:49.340]  It isn't just curry, it's concentrated curry, the actual essence organically transferred
[03:54:49.340 --> 03:54:56.900]  and the great Indian analysts, the great Indian apothecaries, I'll tell you, the turmeric's
[03:54:56.900 --> 03:54:58.540]  the top thing.
[03:54:58.540 --> 03:55:03.340]  You take it with the different compounds we've got in the pill that are natural as well, they
[03:55:03.340 --> 03:55:08.660]  accelerate it and they get it into your body, into your cells, I'm going to leave it at
[03:55:08.660 --> 03:55:09.660]  that.
[03:55:09.660 --> 03:55:14.460]  So the InfoWars Life Strength and Recovery Combo is 50% off, Alpha Power and Bodies
[03:55:14.460 --> 03:55:20.980]  right now and you fund the InfoWars a total and complete, gigantic, insane fire-breathing

[03:55:30.860 --> 03:55:34.860]  them to do a better deal, the Deep Earth Crystalline that was so popular, I thought it was gone

[03:55:39.180 --> 03:55:47.100]  at those 6,000 plus reviews, 4.9, 98% review, the original exact same, survival shield X2,
[03:55:47.100 --> 03:55:52.780]  we got the deal, I played Gutsball, Art of the Deal and we got it for you and that's
[03:55:52.780 --> 03:55:59.460]  why it's 30% off pre-ordered out of the gates in a discount, passing those discounts on
[03:55:59.460 --> 03:56:00.460]  to you.
[03:56:00.460 --> 03:56:07.700]  Now, let me stop right there, I did not get to the AOC thing and I did not spend time
[03:56:07.700 --> 03:56:14.740]  on all the other big stories that I've got here, I did not do that and I've got Faith
[03:56:14.740 --> 03:56:18.980]  Goldie popping in and I've got Paul Watson in the studio but let me tell you something,
[03:56:18.980 --> 03:56:25.260]  I'm not a vindictive person and I don't even like going to the zoo because you see those
[03:56:25.260 --> 03:56:32.820]  poor caged tigers and things that should be running around in the jungle and I don't wish
[03:56:32.820 --> 03:56:37.420]  harm on her but she wishes harm on us and she's trying to take over our lives and trying
[03:56:37.420 --> 03:56:42.820]  to run things but Dinesh D'Souza who's a friend of mine and who is one of the top documentary
[03:56:42.820 --> 03:56:49.580]  filmmakers in history, got some of his friends to give $20,000 something to his college best
[03:56:49.580 --> 03:56:54.340]  friend who was running for Senate against Hillary Clinton a decade ago and then once
[03:56:54.340 --> 03:56:59.580]  he got a divorce, the liberals got his bank records and they found out that he didn't
[03:56:59.580 --> 03:57:03.220]  know it was illegal, he could have just set up a pact and done it but he got them to
[03:57:03.220 --> 03:57:08.260]  get $23,000, I've got the articles here to the Senate candidate.
[03:57:08.260 --> 03:57:13.220]  Now Hillary's gotten billions at her illegal foundation, she didn't get in trouble and
[03:57:13.220 --> 03:57:20.660]  now AOC raised $18 million at one pact that she never identified as hers and kept millions
[03:57:20.660 --> 03:57:26.300]  and now she's in a lot of trouble, I'm going to say this right now, AOC needs to be under
[03:57:26.300 --> 03:57:30.900]  the prison but they're going to try to spend this but if we get the story out accurately
[03:57:30.900 --> 03:57:37.780]  we could send AOC to prison and by the way, the planets have aligned here, the planets
[03:57:37.780 --> 03:57:44.220]  have aligned, the Democrats want to flush this turd and I want to help them to do that.
[03:57:44.220 --> 03:57:49.740]  The war is our life, well grown and we wait, boxing championship fights, it's about who
[03:57:49.740 --> 03:57:55.420]  wants it, who's prepared to go the longest and who's ready to do the damage, we took
[03:57:55.420 --> 03:58:00.100]  on Hillary Clinton, we stopped her, we got a nationalist in, nationalists are getting
[03:58:00.100 --> 03:58:04.940]  elected all over the world right now, we are winning but those of us who are at the very
[03:58:04.940 --> 03:58:09.860]  front line at the tip of the spear are under unprecedented attack so I come to you each
[03:58:09.860 --> 03:58:14.860]  day and try to explain to you that this is a war of attrition, this is about who wants
