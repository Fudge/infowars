[00:00.000 --> 00:28.000]  I know that I don't understand the way my feelings roll
[00:28.000 --> 00:42.000]  I've got to look outside again and wonder where I've gone
[00:58.000 --> 01:11.000]  It is Friday, November 15th, 2019 I am your host Alex Jones
[01:11.000 --> 01:16.000]  And as I predicted for weeks and as I definitively said yesterday
[01:16.000 --> 01:20.000]  Roger Stone would be found guilty on all counts
[01:20.000 --> 01:24.000]  He faces 50 years
[01:24.000 --> 01:29.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, for thought crime
[01:29.000 --> 01:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, he was completely and totally railroaded
[01:37.000 --> 01:40.000]  There is a good shot if they don't take him into custody
[01:40.000 --> 01:43.000]  The hearing is still ongoing right now that he will be on the broadcast today
[01:43.000 --> 01:46.000]  They have let him know that if he does speak out against it
[01:46.000 --> 01:49.000]  The judge will throw the book at him even harder
[01:49.000 --> 01:52.000]  But it's up to Roger what he's going to do
[01:52.000 --> 01:57.000]  We are getting some of the reporters on the broadcast that were there and witnessed it
[01:57.000 --> 02:00.000]  But I want to explain something, this is ongoing
[02:00.000 --> 02:05.000]  The judge we've confirmed has allowed Antifa operatives
[02:05.000 --> 02:13.000]  That's who works for Soros to have wireless mics in the courtroom transmitting out
[02:13.000 --> 02:18.000]  They allow protesters against Stone but no one who's pro-Stone on the grounds
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.000]  They gave power to write wingwatch that owns a big inflatable rat
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  The courthouse plugged it in and has it right there at the entrance
[02:26.000 --> 02:28.000]  There has never been a railroading like this
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.000]  And remember we exposed that there was a juror, was a high level Obama official
[02:32.000 --> 02:37.000]  We got the name right and her husband was on the Mueller probe
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.000]  When we exposed it they called for our arrest, it was totally legal what we did
[02:41.000 --> 02:47.000]  But the judge removed her off of the jury
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.000]  But again they allowed people when Roger would walk in every day to hold up
[02:51.000 --> 02:56.000]  Lock him up signs and throw little plastic Russian flags at him
[02:56.000 --> 03:02.000]  This is the show trial ladies and gentlemen and this is the model of what they want nationwide
[03:02.000 --> 03:05.000]  Now we know who was on that jury and it's legal and lawful
[03:05.000 --> 03:08.000]  And in the next few days we're going to be exposing it
[03:08.000 --> 03:13.000]  CIA operatives, Democrat party operatives, people that work for Clinton, Obama, high level
[03:13.000 --> 03:20.000]  Not just this one woman, the first that it came out in that hearing was selected as the first juror
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.000]  The judge was telling everybody you don't talk about who these people are
[03:24.000 --> 03:28.000]  Just like you don't talk about who the whistleblower is, Eric Saramawa
[03:28.000 --> 03:33.000]  So that you wouldn't find out he was a political operative involved with Hunter Biden and Joe Biden
[03:33.000 --> 03:37.000]  So that's where we are ladies and gentlemen
[03:37.000 --> 03:40.000]  This is the tyranny and this is a warm up for President Trump
[03:40.000 --> 03:45.000]  And President Trump hasn't gotten Assange out of jail he could when he told Assange to release the WikiLeaks
[03:45.000 --> 03:47.000]  That's a big black mark on the president
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.000]  And if he doesn't, pardon Roger Stone
[03:51.000 --> 03:56.000]  Well then I mean I got to tell you no matter how many good things Trump does
[03:56.000 --> 04:00.000]  Doing this to Assange and letting stone hang out to dry if he does this
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  I just don't know what I'm going to do
[04:02.000 --> 04:04.000]  We need to call the White House right now
[04:04.000 --> 04:11.000]  202-456-1414 and tell President Trump to pardon him
[04:11.000 --> 04:14.000]  Don't let him get their hands on him, they'll put him in solitary confinement
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  God knows what they'll do to his food
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.000]  These people mean business and they mean to kill him
[04:19.000 --> 04:28.000]  202-5 again 202-456-1414-202-456-1414
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.000]  And this is Roger's wish, obviously I've been talking to him
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  He said all about the grace of God by a miracle
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  Would he not be railroaded, this thing's totally staged
[04:36.000 --> 04:40.000]  Facing 50 years in jail for getting Trump elected for thought crime
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  The live feed of the show is posted at m4wars.com
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.000]  With the headline that he's been convicted, faces 50 years for thought crime
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.000]  Please share that link, fight back!
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  This is 1776 Part 2
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  A lot of patriots went to prison back then
[04:53.000 --> 04:56.000]  This country was paid for in blood
[04:56.000 --> 05:03.000]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true
[05:03.000 --> 05:09.000]  But I'm here to tell you that most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball
[05:09.000 --> 05:11.000]  I could see where the globalists were going
[05:11.000 --> 05:14.000]  I could see what their in-game agenda was
[05:14.000 --> 05:16.000]  What their goal was
[05:16.000 --> 05:19.000]  And I knew that when they were setting us up to be deplatformed
[05:19.000 --> 05:23.000]  That they were really setting the precedent to take everybody off air
[05:23.000 --> 05:30.000]  To silence everyone, to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers
[05:30.000 --> 05:34.000]  So that their false narratives couldn't be opposed
[05:34.000 --> 05:40.000]  What the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future
[05:40.000 --> 05:45.000]  It was the model of m4wars as much as the information that had to be silenced
[05:45.000 --> 05:49.000]  Because they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.000]  And the evil they're pushing to succeed
[05:51.000 --> 05:57.000]  And that's why keeping m4wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever
[06:22.000 --> 06:27.000]  I tried to silence you
[06:31.000 --> 06:38.000]  You keep coming back again
[06:38.000 --> 06:43.000]  You keep coming back again
[06:43.000 --> 06:50.000]  We're live broadcasting worldwide on this dark Friday, November 15th, 2019
[06:50.000 --> 06:52.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones
[06:52.000 --> 06:55.000]  I didn't go out on a limb yesterday
[06:55.000 --> 06:58.000]  When I went ahead and gave out the White House switchboard number and said call
[06:58.000 --> 07:05.000]  They built a railroad track right out of that so-called federal courthouse
[07:05.000 --> 07:09.000]  With that Obama appointee judge that let Hillary off on the Benghazi crimes
[07:09.000 --> 07:15.000]  And the stand down and they were railroading him straight into prison
[07:15.000 --> 07:19.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, he faces 50 years
[07:19.000 --> 07:22.000]  And I'm making a prediction here
[07:22.000 --> 07:27.000]  I've actually looked at the seven charges and the judge I believe can twist it
[07:27.000 --> 07:31.000]  She may give him more than 50
[07:31.000 --> 07:35.000]  Because these monsters want you to know they'll put you in prison if you stand up for America
[07:35.000 --> 07:40.000]  He is a modern thought criminal who has done nothing
[07:40.000 --> 07:45.000]  President Trump told Julian Assange, release the WikiLeaks
[07:45.000 --> 07:49.000]  He did and I'm not an occult
[07:49.000 --> 07:56.000]  I like Trump way more than Hillary and I think he's done a lot of good things, but I gotta tell you
[07:56.000 --> 08:03.000]  I don't know what I'm gonna do if Trump doesn't part in stone
[08:03.000 --> 08:06.000]  His 40-plus year wingman
[08:06.000 --> 08:13.000]  These guys have dated the same women, whole nine yards
[08:13.000 --> 08:21.000]  And if Trump follows his penchant
[08:21.000 --> 08:26.000]  For hanging people out to dry that got him elected
[08:26.000 --> 08:30.000]  I don't know what I'm gonna do
[08:30.000 --> 08:39.000]  I know Roger Stone really well and the truth is he is a softy, an artist
[08:39.000 --> 08:43.000]  Very liberal in many ways, but he loves America genuinely
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.000]  He does love God as well
[08:45.000 --> 08:48.000]  We've prayed at dinner years ago, he got a tear in his eye
[08:48.000 --> 08:52.000]  But that's not the stone they put out, they call him this villain, this guy
[08:52.000 --> 08:56.000]  He would always caution me on stuff we were doing and I wasn't doing anything immoral
[08:56.000 --> 08:58.000]  He was always being very careful on the facts
[08:58.000 --> 09:03.000]  He was effective for Trump and he advised Trump through the campaign for at least the first year
[09:03.000 --> 09:08.000]  And they knew they were having almost daily phone conversations because Trump was tapped, we exposed all that
[09:08.000 --> 09:13.000]  And I was giving Stone advice, she agreed with a lot of it, was going right to the president
[09:13.000 --> 09:18.000]  Why do you think they got so obsessed with M4s and Alex Jones?
[09:18.000 --> 09:26.000]  Because we literally were in the White House via our information, it was the M4s presidency
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  And that's why they're trying to destroy me
[09:29.000 --> 09:33.000]  With all the things you've seen, the planet, child porn, all of it
[09:33.000 --> 09:39.000]  The headlines that I wore, swastika shoes, you know, that I'm running around having, trying to have gay, sexual people
[09:39.000 --> 09:42.000]  All of this is how they're trying to take us down
[09:42.000 --> 09:45.000]  They do opposition research, they make up crap, they're trying to figure out
[09:45.000 --> 09:49.000]  How do we make right-wing Christians not support somebody?
[09:49.000 --> 09:56.000]  And I got to tell you ladies and gentlemen, I talked to Stone
[09:56.000 --> 10:01.000]  And he said, only by the grace of God in a miracle are they not going to convict me
[10:01.000 --> 10:06.000]  This specificity says if I say anything, when they convict me, they're going to put me under the jail
[10:06.000 --> 10:10.000]  And he goes, obviously they're going to give me Manafort treatment, solitary confinement
[10:10.000 --> 10:13.000]  And he's not stupid, they're going to jack his food, it's what they do
[10:13.000 --> 10:17.000]  Hell, they may break his frickin' neck in there, man
[10:17.000 --> 10:20.000]  And then they hear him screaming and begging for his life like Epstein
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  And then he'll just tell you, he fell down
[10:22.000 --> 10:26.000]  These crooks still run the system
[10:26.000 --> 10:32.000]  So it's a death sentence for getting Trump elected if he goes into their damn custody
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.000]  And the Manafort's different
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.000]  He did run scams with the Bidens, with everybody, and didn't pay taxes
[10:38.000 --> 10:41.000]  They all do it, but they burned him for what they all do
[10:41.000 --> 10:45.000]  Stone hadn't done a damn thing
[10:45.000 --> 10:48.000]  Except get Trump elected
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.000]  And these monsters are going to use this as the beta test with their jurisdictions
[10:53.000 --> 10:56.000]  To go after everybody and try to put them in prison
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  Where I live in Travis County
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  Try to put Rick Perry in jail for no reason
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  Put Tom DeLay in jail till he got it out on appeal
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  People say, why do you live here?
[11:06.000 --> 11:12.000]  Well, literally, my ancestors founded the stinking city
[11:12.000 --> 11:15.000]  But I probably will leave if I can get the money to move the studio
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  It's damn right I'm leaving
[11:17.000 --> 11:24.000]  The point is, is that D.C. San Francisco's run by the red diaper doper baby son of the weatherman
[11:24.000 --> 11:29.000]  That blew up police stations
[11:29.000 --> 11:32.000]  And if you live in one of those jurisdictions
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.000]  You're going to pay for people's abortions and their sex changes
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.000]  And they're going to throw your ass in prison
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  Because that's who they are
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  And they mean business
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  He didn't live in D.C.
[11:44.000 --> 11:49.000]  He pointed him there from Florida, sent him there to be destroyed
[11:49.000 --> 11:53.000]  You notice that witch had her minions call for my arrest
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.000]  When I pointed out they were regular jury
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.000]  And by the way, I've talked to reporters that were there
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.000]  There were other people that worked for Obama and Hillary high level
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  Famous people, CIA, all of them
[12:02.000 --> 12:05.000]  And they went in there and they hung his ass
[12:05.000 --> 12:09.000]  One old woman was going to vote to have him be found not guilty
[12:09.000 --> 12:13.000]  She fell down in the hall and pool of blood's all we know
[12:13.000 --> 12:18.000]  They put an alternate juror on
[12:18.000 --> 12:21.000]  So they've got all their lies writing on this
[12:21.000 --> 12:24.000]  That somebody go to jail, not the 13 indicted Russian bots
[12:24.000 --> 12:27.000]  Not all this other made up leprechaun crap
[12:27.000 --> 12:34.000]  But Roger Stone
[12:34.000 --> 12:37.000]  They wanted to arrest Don Jr. Remember that?
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.000]  They wanted to arrest Don Jr.
[12:39.000 --> 12:43.000]  Because he told you who the stinking CIA liar was
[12:43.000 --> 12:45.000]  Eric Suramala
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  Now everybody's saying, oh it is right
[12:47.000 --> 12:48.000]  We need to be journalists
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.000]  Politico says, it's true, you're supposed to name them
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.000]  We've got to call their bluff
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  They think they can intimidate all of us
[12:58.000 --> 12:59.000]  I don't think they can
[12:59.000 --> 13:01.000]  I think America isn't made up of wimps
[13:01.000 --> 13:02.000]  I think you've been asleep
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.000]  I think that's why we've allowed the corruption to grow
[13:05.000 --> 13:08.000]  Now here's the number, the switchboard, it's Roger's wish
[13:08.000 --> 13:11.000]  He said to me, plan B, when they convict me
[13:11.000 --> 13:15.000]  All seven counts
[13:15.000 --> 13:18.000]  Will be free Roger Stone
[13:18.000 --> 13:19.000]  He sent me the image
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000]  Let's pull that free Roger Stone up if we can in a moment
[13:22.000 --> 13:26.000]  That was from Roger, 202-456-1414
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  This is Roger's wish to you
[13:28.000 --> 13:29.000]  He asked you to pray for him
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.000]  And he asked you to call the president
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  He's the man of his word
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  They want to put him in that prison
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  They want to torture him
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  Till he lies about the president
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  So the president would be politically insane
[13:42.000 --> 13:43.000]  Not to get him out
[13:43.000 --> 13:44.000]  He's innocent
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  Plus, everyone knows these are show trials
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  Everyone knows that the impeachment's totally phony
[13:49.000 --> 13:50.000]  That's exploded
[13:50.000 --> 13:51.000]  The wheels flew off of that
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  They didn't just fall off
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.000]  They blew out and just flew off
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  Like Michael Hastings' car
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  When it blew up and shot the engine 300 yards down the street
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  With a huge bomb in it
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.000]  They told you, nothing to see or move along
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.000]  These aren't the droids you're looking for
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  So David Knight still has a Twitter
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.000]  He put that out yesterday morning
[14:10.000 --> 14:11.000]  On his Twitter
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  We'll put it up on screen for you
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  I think it's at Libertarian
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  And you can retweet it there if you feel like doing that
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  Paul Watson's scheduled to be joining us as well
[14:19.000 --> 14:20.000]  But there it is
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  A reporter's observing the Roger Stone trial
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  Expect a quick verdict
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.000]  From a rigged jury that begins deliberations this morning
[14:28.000 --> 14:31.000]  Join me live this morning for an update of the travesty
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  Of the other political show trial
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.000]  Free Roger Stone
[14:37.000 --> 14:41.000]  I'm going to ask Paul to retweet that when he joins us
[14:41.000 --> 14:43.000]  They'll probably ban him for daring to stand up
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  And say, free somebody
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.000]  But that's what's going on here
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  That's what's happening
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  And the press is in trouble
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  America's in trouble
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  And President Trump has not stood up
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.000]  To the racketeering and the attack on the press
[14:59.000 --> 15:00.000]  The independent press has not stood up
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  To the organized racketeering of big tech
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  Coming after even members of Congress and blocking them
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  And I know it feels great to say
[15:07.000 --> 15:08.000]  Oh, Trump's wonderful
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  And everything they do against him
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  Doesn't stick as it's made up
[15:12.000 --> 15:13.000]  Great, what about us?
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.000]  What about the president protecting the American people?
[15:16.000 --> 15:17.000]  Are they going to come and die at me?
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.000]  Have another rigged jury?
[15:19.000 --> 15:22.000]  And then Trump just sits there and plays golf
[15:22.000 --> 15:27.000]  And talks about how he's a stable genius?
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  You remember what happened that night?
[15:29.000 --> 15:30.000]  We ought to find the clip
[15:30.000 --> 15:35.000]  2 a.m. when Trump came out
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  And Hillary wouldn't even concede
[15:37.000 --> 15:38.000]  She was drunk, collapsed
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  I looked at Roger Lab on there and I said
[15:40.000 --> 15:41.000]  You get ready, they're coming after us
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  He goes, we'll have Trump, we'll have the president
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  I said, buddy, you better get ready
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  They're going to put us in prison or kill us
[15:47.000 --> 15:48.000]  On TV, I told him
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  The next day I talked to that parking lot
[15:50.000 --> 15:51.000]  I got him by the arm and I said, buddy
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  Guard yourself for true
[15:53.000 --> 15:54.000]  Stay with us
[15:54.000 --> 16:01.000]  We're in attack formation
[16:24.000 --> 16:27.000]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com
[16:55.000 --> 16:57.000]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it
[16:57.000 --> 16:59.000]  If you're trying to quit drinking
[16:59.000 --> 17:02.000]  Or doing too many drugs, listen to me
[17:02.000 --> 17:04.000]  You don't know me and will never meet
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  I had a problem like you once
[17:06.000 --> 17:08.000]  I drank and used to party a little too much
[17:08.000 --> 17:10.000]  Till it got out of control
[17:10.000 --> 17:12.000]  And almost ruined my life
[17:12.000 --> 17:15.000]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem
[17:15.000 --> 17:17.000]  Before it totally destroyed me
[17:17.000 --> 17:20.000]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem
[17:20.000 --> 17:22.000]  And you know you can't do it alone
[17:22.000 --> 17:25.000]  You need to call the national treatment advisors
[17:25.000 --> 17:28.000]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.000]  To replace your old habits with new habits
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  And totally change your life
[17:32.000 --> 17:35.000]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance
[17:35.000 --> 17:37.000]  The entire program may be covered
[17:37.000 --> 17:39.000]  Fix your problem right now
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.000]  Before it gets any worse
[17:41.000 --> 17:59.000]  Get clean, call now and learn more
[17:59.000 --> 18:03.000]  About a month ago, President Trump announced
[18:03.000 --> 18:05.000]  That he was going to move his domicile
[18:05.000 --> 18:08.000]  From New York City to Florida
[18:08.000 --> 18:10.000]  Where he's always said he planned to retire to
[18:10.000 --> 18:13.000]  And the left got so excited
[18:13.000 --> 18:16.000]  They said, oh, he's about to resign
[18:16.000 --> 18:19.000]  And leave instead of facing impeachment
[18:19.000 --> 18:21.000]  And he's running to Florida
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  Well, now we know why the president did that
[18:23.000 --> 18:26.000]  He knew the leftist-controlled appeals courts
[18:26.000 --> 18:29.000]  We're going to say that he had to give up his tax returns
[18:29.000 --> 18:32.000]  So they can pour over them and harass every business partner
[18:32.000 --> 18:35.000]  He's got, they want to terrorize people
[18:35.000 --> 18:37.000]  That he's worked with
[18:37.000 --> 18:40.000]  And by moving his domicile from New York to Florida
[18:40.000 --> 18:43.000]  That gets around the New York law they passed
[18:43.000 --> 18:47.000]  To get his tax returns that are supposed to be private
[18:47.000 --> 18:50.000]  So all those people out there holding their breath
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  For the president to resign
[18:52.000 --> 18:56.000]  In his words, we're kicking the deep state's ass
[18:56.000 --> 18:58.000]  And he's never going to resign
[18:58.000 --> 19:01.000]  The globalists know that I will never
[19:01.000 --> 19:03.000]  Willingly give up
[19:03.000 --> 19:06.000]  I've said it many times, I will never give in
[19:06.000 --> 19:09.000]  I will never give up, but I could give out
[19:09.000 --> 19:12.000]  And it's very, very frustrating to see them
[19:12.000 --> 19:15.000]  Committing all their crimes against humanity
[19:15.000 --> 19:18.000]  To see evil running rampant like this
[19:18.000 --> 19:22.000]  And to know that most Americans have already been silenced
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  In cyberspace
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  That most Americans have already been shadow-banned
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  By big tech
[19:28.000 --> 19:31.000]  And to know that most Americans feel powerless
[19:31.000 --> 19:34.000]  And don't realize how much power they have
[19:34.000 --> 19:37.000]  By spreading the word about newswords.com
[19:37.000 --> 19:40.000]  Infowars.com and band.video
[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  And that people are hungry for the truth
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  Now more than ever, and that if you tell people
[19:44.000 --> 19:47.000]  Hey, the band truth they don't want you to have
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  Is at infowords.com forward slash show
[19:49.000 --> 19:51.000]  And band.video
[19:51.000 --> 19:54.000]  So take heart, folks, they've had to censor everybody
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  To show everybody down because the truth is powerful
[19:56.000 --> 19:58.000]  And they can't beat us fair and square
[19:58.000 --> 20:01.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:29.000 --> 20:33.000]  Oh, we were drinking champagne on election night
[20:33.000 --> 20:36.000]  2016
[20:36.000 --> 20:39.000]  I could feel the disturbance
[20:39.000 --> 20:42.000]  And I knew we'd sucker-punch them
[20:42.000 --> 20:44.000]  And I knew they were gonna strike back
[20:44.000 --> 20:47.000]  Every time I had a chance to talk to Trump
[20:47.000 --> 20:49.000]  I told him you're surrounded by spies
[20:49.000 --> 20:51.000]  You're being spied on, the deep stage is gonna move against you
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.000]  Fire everyone from the establishment
[20:53.000 --> 20:56.000]  Don't believe the people that try to bring in establishment operatives
[20:56.000 --> 20:58.000]  When they pledge allegiance to you
[20:58.000 --> 21:00.000]  You've got to bring people in from the mid-level, the low-level
[21:00.000 --> 21:02.000]  And from the military
[21:02.000 --> 21:04.000]  And from the professions like doctors and others
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  I said bring Rand Paul in
[21:06.000 --> 21:10.000]  I got Trump harping constantly
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.000]  To seal the breach with Rand Paul
[21:13.000 --> 21:16.000]  I talked to Ron Paul off air and pushed that as well
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.000]  I'm not bragging
[21:18.000 --> 21:21.000]  What Trump needs is people from outside the swamp
[21:21.000 --> 21:24.000]  To bring him common sense
[21:24.000 --> 21:27.000]  Roger Stone got Trump elected
[21:27.000 --> 21:30.000]  The listeners of the show got Trump elected
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  Matt Drudge got Trump elected
[21:32.000 --> 21:34.000]  The truth got Trump elected
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.000]  And I love Trump
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  But I'm here to tell you
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  Like I said on yesterday's show
[21:40.000 --> 21:42.000]  I said
[21:42.000 --> 21:44.000]  We don't need tweets from President Trump about this
[21:44.000 --> 21:46.000]  We need action
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.000]  We don't need a couple tweets from President Trump
[21:48.000 --> 21:50.000]  Saying this is a miscarriage of justice
[21:50.000 --> 21:54.000]  And then nothing
[21:54.000 --> 21:58.000]  We need action
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  From President Trump
[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  So that this collection of criminals
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  That thinks they're invincible
[22:04.000 --> 22:10.000]  Can't continue to just intimidate everybody
[22:10.000 --> 22:12.000]  You know I looked it up
[22:12.000 --> 22:15.000]  A few days ago and I couldn't find any examples
[22:15.000 --> 22:18.000]  Of open hearings
[22:18.000 --> 22:21.000]  In Congress
[22:21.000 --> 22:23.000]  And particularly any impeachment hearings
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  That have ever happened
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  Where the other party out of power
[22:27.000 --> 22:32.000]  Can't ask questions of the so called witnesses
[22:32.000 --> 22:35.000]  But you never seen stuff like what's happened in the stone
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  This is new
[22:37.000 --> 22:40.000]  This is called tyranny
[22:40.000 --> 22:43.000]  And Trump is able to withstand this
[22:43.000 --> 22:45.000]  But he's the only one
[22:45.000 --> 22:48.000]  Does he expect his supporters and media
[22:48.000 --> 22:50.000]  To withstand it
[22:50.000 --> 22:52.000]  Because they'll put people in your operation
[22:52.000 --> 22:54.000]  They'll try to break up your family
[22:54.000 --> 22:55.000]  They'll try to take your children
[22:55.000 --> 22:56.000]  They'll try to plant drugs on you
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.000]  They'll plant child porn on you
[22:58.000 --> 23:01.000]  Letting these criminals keep operating at this level
[23:01.000 --> 23:04.000]  And plant fake Russia stuff on the president
[23:04.000 --> 23:07.000]  Is a danger to everybody
[23:07.000 --> 23:10.000]  But Trump watches Fox News
[23:10.000 --> 23:11.000]  Mainly
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  They've gotten successful at keeping most of info wars
[23:13.000 --> 23:18.000]  And Roger Stone away from him
[23:18.000 --> 23:19.000]  It's incredible
[23:19.000 --> 23:21.000]  Such a travesty of justice
[23:21.000 --> 23:24.000]  And you've seen Chris Wallace and all the rest of them up there
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  Praising the testimonies where the people say
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  Our third party Trump did this
[23:28.000 --> 23:29.000]  And now we learn there is no whistleblower
[23:29.000 --> 23:32.000]  Because they all just made it up
[23:32.000 --> 23:34.000]  Eric Suramala was just the guy that if they had to
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.000]  Would say he heard it
[23:36.000 --> 23:40.000]  Turns out he wasn't even in the room
[23:40.000 --> 23:45.000]  Roger Stone found guilty of lying about 2016 leaks
[23:45.000 --> 23:47.000]  But he didn't even do that
[23:47.000 --> 23:50.000]  But what does Trump say in his tweet?
[23:50.000 --> 23:53.000]  Maybe Stone can eat this in prison
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  Need to pardon him
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  You pardoned our Pio, we got that to you
[23:57.000 --> 23:59.000]  Trump didn't even know about it when we got it to him
[23:59.000 --> 24:00.000]  You heard our Pio come on and say
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  No, Roger Stone and Alex Jones got to Trump
[24:02.000 --> 24:05.000]  Last time I got to talk to Trump
[24:05.000 --> 24:07.000]  It was like a year and a half ago
[24:07.000 --> 24:08.000]  And I'm like, listen
[24:08.000 --> 24:10.000]  You know they're putting the sheriff in prison
[24:10.000 --> 24:11.000]  What? I didn't hear that
[24:11.000 --> 24:12.000]  What do you mean? He had a trial?
[24:12.000 --> 24:14.000]  No, no, the judge is doing it
[24:14.000 --> 24:15.000]  Well, the judge can't do that
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.000]  Yes, Mr. President
[24:17.000 --> 24:19.000]  We need you to pardon him
[24:19.000 --> 24:21.000]  They're coming after him because he released documents
[24:21.000 --> 24:22.000]  Showing you were being spied on
[24:22.000 --> 24:23.000]  They got from the DEA
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  We released the original NSA documents
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  Wait, wait, how do you know about that?
[24:27.000 --> 24:28.000]  How do I know about it?
[24:28.000 --> 24:29.000]  I was telling you about it a year ago
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  Well, whoa, whoa, whoa
[24:31.000 --> 24:32.000]  I'm like, listen
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.000]  I don't need you to tell me how great I am
[24:34.000 --> 24:35.000]  They take you out
[24:35.000 --> 24:36.000]  They're going to get me next
[24:36.000 --> 24:39.000]  I need you to go after them
[24:39.000 --> 24:41.000]  You think they like me on the phone with him
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  Saying that with all those damn traders
[24:43.000 --> 24:45.000]  They're listening?
[24:45.000 --> 24:48.000]  This is what Roger Stone gets
[24:48.000 --> 24:51.000]  So they now convict Roger Stone of lying
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.000]  And want to jail him for many years to come
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  Well, what about Crooked Hillary?
[24:56.000 --> 24:59.000]  Comey, Strock, Paige McKay, Brennan, Clapper
[24:59.000 --> 25:02.000]  Chippney Schiff, Orr and Steele
[25:02.000 --> 25:03.000]  And it goes on
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.000]  All the others including even Muller himself
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  Didn't they lie?
[25:08.000 --> 25:13.000]  But Trump, Stone didn't even do anything
[25:13.000 --> 25:16.000]  He did have a few contacts that talked to Assange
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.000]  Assange was talking to everybody back then
[25:18.000 --> 25:19.000]  He was the darling back then
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.000]  Didn't know how much danger he was in that embassy then
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.000]  It was when he had the run of the embassy
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  He wasn't in solitary confinement there yet
[25:26.000 --> 25:29.000]  So the Hillary lost he was
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.000]  I called him Hillary's butt plug on here
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.000]  Because he wouldn't give us any of the intel
[25:33.000 --> 25:34.000]  He wouldn't talk to us
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.000]  He wouldn't do anything he would say
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  Talk to my hand
[25:38.000 --> 25:39.000]  And then he would say
[25:39.000 --> 25:40.000]  But this is going to be damning to Hillary
[25:40.000 --> 25:41.000]  Everybody did that
[25:41.000 --> 25:42.000]  So Stone would hype it up
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  So when it came out it would hurt him
[25:44.000 --> 25:49.000]  And now he faces 50 years in prison
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.000]  Ladies and gentlemen
[25:51.000 --> 25:53.000]  When his only crime
[25:53.000 --> 25:54.000]  Is yeah, the guy could run marathons
[25:54.000 --> 25:55.000]  He was a bodybuilder
[25:55.000 --> 26:03.000]  But I don't think Roger Stone's a tough guy
[26:03.000 --> 26:11.000]  Roger Stone is a liberal that loves America
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.000]  Not a leftist
[26:13.000 --> 26:16.000]  And now ladies and gentlemen
[26:16.000 --> 26:19.000]  He is a political prisoner
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  And is the test case for everything these people want to do
[26:21.000 --> 26:22.000]  To all of us
[26:22.000 --> 26:25.000]  Trump's already under this show trial
[26:25.000 --> 26:28.000]  Where they can't even question
[26:28.000 --> 26:31.000]  The stupid witnesses in round two
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  But don't worry, there's another round
[26:33.000 --> 26:34.000]  In the intelligence committee
[26:34.000 --> 26:35.000]  Where it's not even supposed to be
[26:35.000 --> 26:39.000]  That's coming up next
[26:39.000 --> 26:41.000]  Drudgerport.com is top-linked to us
[26:41.000 --> 26:43.000]  There is a very good chance
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  We're going to be getting Stone on
[26:45.000 --> 26:46.000]  If they haven't taken him into custody
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  I'm told the hearing is still ongoing
[26:48.000 --> 26:49.000]  Sentencing will be later
[26:49.000 --> 26:52.000]  But are they going to let him even out?
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  I know I'm going to be able to get his wife
[26:54.000 --> 26:55.000]  And his pastor on
[26:55.000 --> 26:57.000]  That was his request
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  I think we give those to the producer
[26:59.000 --> 27:00.000]  During the next break
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  And we're going to get those folks here
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  On the show today
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  But this is just an amazing time
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  To be alive ladies and gentlemen
[27:08.000 --> 27:10.000]  And I'm not afraid of these globalists
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.000]  I'm pissed that America has become
[27:12.000 --> 27:15.000]  So cowardly or spectatorish
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.000]  That we're kind of just watching this happen to Stone
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.000]  And watching this happen to his supporters
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  And watching this happen to InfoWars
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  I know our audience of activists
[27:24.000 --> 27:25.000]  Loves InfoWars and supports us
[27:25.000 --> 27:26.000]  And gets the word out
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  But if I spent time
[27:28.000 --> 27:30.000]  Getting into all the dirty tricks they've engaged in
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.000]  And all the left walks up to me
[27:34.000 --> 27:35.000]  Anytime on the street and goes
[27:35.000 --> 27:37.000]  I'm glad you don't have your kids
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.000]  And I go, oh, like Epstein
[27:40.000 --> 27:41.000]  He likes to get people's kids
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  And they go, oh, there's a video of this
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  And I go, guess what, jerk
[27:45.000 --> 27:47.000]  I got them full time
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.000]  But they tried to take them
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.000]  And more than 50 members of the media
[27:51.000 --> 27:52.000]  Sat there and ran lies
[27:52.000 --> 27:54.000]  To feed it back to the jury
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.000]  Hoping they'd take my kids away
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  These people are unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen
[28:02.000 --> 28:04.000]  They're terrorists
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  And giving in to them, appeasing them
[28:06.000 --> 28:07.000]  Only makes it worse
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  We have to stop feeding the pirate
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  We have to stop paying the bounty
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  But if the chief executive
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  After all he's been through
[28:15.000 --> 28:16.000]  And after all he's seen
[28:16.000 --> 28:17.000]  Won't move decisively
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  And a bar won't move decisively
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  And if they won't take action
[28:21.000 --> 28:24.000]  What the hell are we supposed to do?
[28:25.000 --> 28:26.000]  As the American people
[28:26.000 --> 28:27.000]  Please call the White House
[28:27.000 --> 28:28.000]  And tell the president
[28:28.000 --> 28:30.000]  It's time to part and stone now
[28:30.000 --> 28:31.000]  He's done nothing wrong
[28:31.000 --> 28:32.000]  Don't send out a tweet about
[28:32.000 --> 28:33.000]  Well, if he lied
[28:33.000 --> 28:34.000]  Everybody else lied, let him go
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  No, he's innocent
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  He's being targeted because he supported you
[28:38.000 --> 28:39.000]  You've got the power to free him
[28:39.000 --> 28:40.000]  Do it, Trump
[28:40.000 --> 28:43.000]  202-456-1414
[28:43.000 --> 28:47.000]  202-456-1414
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  I'm gonna be here until they take me down
[28:49.000 --> 28:50.000]  Until we beat them
[28:50.000 --> 28:51.000]  They beat coming back for more
[28:51.000 --> 28:52.000]  I'm not taking it lying down
[28:52.000 --> 28:53.000]  I'm fighting back
[28:53.000 --> 28:54.000]  And so's our audience
[28:54.000 --> 28:55.000]  Stay with us
[28:55.000 --> 29:24.000]  Paul Lawson's coming up
[29:25.000 --> 29:27.000]  on RealEstate.com
[29:55.000 --> 30:04.000]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson
[30:04.000 --> 30:08.000]  What is the level of tyranny
[30:08.000 --> 30:12.000]  That a tyrant will take humanity to?
[30:12.000 --> 30:13.000]  How far will they go?
[30:13.000 --> 30:14.000]  What's their limit?
[30:14.000 --> 30:15.000]  And he said it is the limit
[30:15.000 --> 30:20.000]  To which other men and women will submit
[30:20.000 --> 30:24.000]  The answer is there is no limit to evil
[30:24.000 --> 30:27.000]  It is a bottomless pit
[30:27.000 --> 30:29.000]  We've been taught in modern culture and society
[30:29.000 --> 30:32.000]  That evil doesn't exist
[30:32.000 --> 30:34.000]  Or that there's no free will
[30:34.000 --> 30:36.000]  There's no devil or the God
[30:36.000 --> 30:37.000]  But those very same people
[30:37.000 --> 30:40.000]  Have all these rules for us about speech
[30:40.000 --> 30:42.000]  And how we can dress
[30:42.000 --> 30:44.000]  And where we can live
[30:44.000 --> 30:46.000]  And what our houses can be like
[30:46.000 --> 30:48.000]  They just don't want us to have any values
[30:48.000 --> 30:50.000]  So they can run over us
[30:50.000 --> 30:52.000]  Oxford's banned clapping
[30:52.000 --> 30:54.000]  Universities in the U.S. have banned
[30:54.000 --> 30:55.000]  21 gun salutes for veterans
[30:55.000 --> 30:57.000]  These people are dangerous cult leaders
[30:57.000 --> 31:00.000]  And it's time to reject them
[31:00.000 --> 31:03.000]  Beto Rourke came out dozens of times
[31:03.000 --> 31:04.000]  And said we're going to confiscate
[31:04.000 --> 31:06.000]  All your semi-automatic rifles
[31:06.000 --> 31:08.000]  And he got all the other Democrats
[31:08.000 --> 31:10.000]  On the stage, nine others to agree
[31:10.000 --> 31:12.000]  And said that he was a hero
[31:12.000 --> 31:13.000]  Think about that
[31:13.000 --> 31:15.000]  Now those Democrats have taken
[31:15.000 --> 31:17.000]  All the guns in the cities they control
[31:17.000 --> 31:20.000]  Their blue cities are literal crap holes
[31:20.000 --> 31:22.000]  Covered with needles
[31:22.000 --> 31:24.000]  And with massive drug dealing
[31:24.000 --> 31:26.000]  And incredible levels of violent crime
[31:26.000 --> 31:28.000]  They know what they're doing
[31:28.000 --> 31:30.000]  And now the Supreme Court's come out
[31:30.000 --> 31:32.000]  And ruled that gun manufacturers
[31:32.000 --> 31:34.000]  Can be sued into oblivion
[31:34.000 --> 31:36.000]  For what criminals do using their firearms
[31:36.000 --> 31:38.000]  My goodness, ladies and gentlemen
[31:38.000 --> 31:40.000]  This country's under such incredible attack
[31:40.000 --> 31:43.000]  But more and more towns and cities
[31:43.000 --> 31:44.000]  Are saying they're sanctuaries
[31:44.000 --> 31:46.000]  For the Second Amendment
[31:46.000 --> 31:47.000]  And they're going to follow the original
[31:47.000 --> 31:49.000]  Bill of Rights and Constitution
[31:49.000 --> 31:50.000]  And they're not going to help
[31:50.000 --> 31:52.000]  In the confiscation of guns
[31:52.000 --> 31:53.000]  So you see, a lot of these cities
[31:53.000 --> 31:55.000]  Ignore illegal aliens
[31:55.000 --> 31:57.000]  Well, we can ignore all your unconstitutional laws
[31:59.000 --> 32:01.000]  Info Wars Life has done it again
[32:01.000 --> 32:04.000]  With undoubtedly our biggest breakthrough yet
[32:04.000 --> 32:08.000]  Super silver whitening toothpaste
[32:08.000 --> 32:10.000]  This is proprietary
[32:10.000 --> 32:12.000]  This is with the top lab in the country
[32:12.000 --> 32:15.000]  And it is incredibly high quality
[32:15.000 --> 32:18.000]  This is the best toothpaste you're going to find
[32:18.000 --> 32:20.000]  It's called whitening toothpaste
[32:20.000 --> 32:22.000]  But really, it knocks out the bacteria
[32:22.000 --> 32:24.000]  It recalcifies the teeth
[32:24.000 --> 32:26.000]  It does so many things on so many fronts
[32:26.000 --> 32:30.000]  These beautiful tubes of super silver toothpaste
[32:30.000 --> 32:32.000]  Are available at an introductory price
[32:32.000 --> 32:34.000]  Of 25% off out of the gates
[32:34.000 --> 32:36.000]  As low as we can go
[32:36.000 --> 32:38.000]  And they're going to sell out very, very quickly
[32:38.000 --> 32:40.000]  Super silver whitening toothpaste
[32:40.000 --> 32:42.000]  Is going to be a hit
[32:42.000 --> 32:44.000]  I'm very, very proud of it
[32:44.000 --> 32:46.000]  I want to thank my father, a retired dentist
[32:46.000 --> 32:48.000]  For spearheading this the last two years
[32:48.000 --> 32:49.000]  And developing it
[32:49.000 --> 32:51.000]  It's 25% off out of the gates
[32:51.000 --> 32:52.000]  That's as low as we can go
[32:52.000 --> 32:54.000]  Because it's very, very expensive to produce
[32:54.000 --> 33:16.000]  Get yours today at InfoWarsLife.com
[33:24.000 --> 33:53.000]  I was sitting here at about 10am
[33:53.000 --> 33:55.000]  An hour before we went live
[33:55.000 --> 33:58.000]  And I had my baseball cap
[33:58.000 --> 34:00.000]  Sitting next to me
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  And it says 1776 on it
[34:02.000 --> 34:04.000]  Yes, it's an InfoWars store
[34:04.000 --> 34:05.000]  Nice designer hat
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  Made in 1776
[34:07.000 --> 34:08.000]  1776 is on the front
[34:08.000 --> 34:11.000]  It's a brand I came out with about seven years ago
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  A little hat I designed
[34:13.000 --> 34:14.000]  But I don't usually wear it on air
[34:14.000 --> 34:17.000]  I just wear it when I'm out
[34:17.000 --> 34:18.000]  And I thought
[34:18.000 --> 34:20.000]  When they convinced him today
[34:20.000 --> 34:21.000]  Probably when I'm on air
[34:21.000 --> 34:28.000]  I'm going to wear that 1776 hat
[34:28.000 --> 34:31.000]  And right before I went live
[34:31.000 --> 34:33.000]  I said, hey, I left it in my bathroom
[34:33.000 --> 34:35.000]  We will get my 1776 hat
[34:35.000 --> 34:37.000]  And right as they walked in and handed it to me
[34:37.000 --> 34:39.000]  They go, Roger Stone, convict it
[34:39.000 --> 34:43.000]  Now that's not some psychic event
[34:43.000 --> 34:45.000]  That's like watching somebody in a bullfight
[34:45.000 --> 34:46.000]  Get run over by the bull
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.000]  And the bull's horn go right through the matador
[34:48.000 --> 34:50.000]  His heart and blood spray everywhere
[34:50.000 --> 34:53.000]  That dude's going to die
[34:53.000 --> 34:55.000]  And we watched this entire rigging
[34:55.000 --> 34:57.000]  And this entire show trial
[34:57.000 --> 34:58.000]  And everything that happened
[34:58.000 --> 35:00.000]  And now the big issue is
[35:00.000 --> 35:06.000]  Is Trump going to hang Stone out to drive
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  Like he's done a saunch
[35:08.000 --> 35:11.000]  Because let me tell you
[35:11.000 --> 35:12.000]  You don't need to be a political
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  Or a rocket scientist to know
[35:14.000 --> 35:23.000]  Whose noose is next
[35:23.000 --> 35:24.000]  And I got to tell you
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  Trump's tweet really upsets me
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  So they now convict Roger Stone of lying
[35:28.000 --> 35:31.000]  And want to jail him for many years to come
[35:31.000 --> 35:34.000]  Wait, what about crooked Hillary, Comey,
[35:34.000 --> 35:37.000]  Strock, Page, McCabe, Brennan, Clapper,
[35:37.000 --> 35:40.000]  Shifty Schiff, or they goes on
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.000]  And all the others including Miller himself
[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  Didn't they lie?
[35:45.000 --> 35:48.000]  But Stone didn't lie
[35:48.000 --> 35:51.000]  He didn't do anything
[35:51.000 --> 35:54.000]  So now I guess Stone facing 50 years in jail
[35:54.000 --> 35:56.000]  At the hands of this show trial
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.000]  This nightmare snorting, laughing,
[35:58.000 --> 36:01.000]  Cackling, wicked witch, Jackson
[36:01.000 --> 36:06.000]  Who covered up for Hillary on Benghazi
[36:06.000 --> 36:09.000]  I guess he can like maybe
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.000]  Eat this in prison
[36:12.000 --> 36:14.000]  And I'm not trying to attack Trump
[36:14.000 --> 36:15.000]  I've been defending Trump
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.000]  And Trump's done a great job of many fronts
[36:17.000 --> 36:19.000]  But when it comes
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.000]  When it comes to taking action against the deep state
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  And prosecuting him
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.000]  We've seen nothing except Avinati
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  And that's because he wasn't really on the inside
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  Of anything and was out on his own
[36:29.000 --> 36:30.000]  Doing little criminal operations
[36:30.000 --> 36:31.000]  And they just let him run with it
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.000]  And see what he could do
[36:34.000 --> 36:35.000]  Now I had Paul Watson coming on
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  To talk about big victories in Europe
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  Huge awakenings against the globalist
[36:39.000 --> 36:40.000]  Very exciting things
[36:40.000 --> 36:42.000]  He just traveled to the big national
[36:42.000 --> 36:43.000]  Sovereignty Day of Poland
[36:43.000 --> 36:44.000]  Which has been called white supremacist
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.000]  Nations even existing is evil now
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  We're going to get to that next segment
[36:48.000 --> 36:49.000]  But I wanted him to respond to this
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  And I'll open the phones up
[36:51.000 --> 36:52.000]  At the start of the next hour
[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  Then Larry Nichols who is the consulate
[36:54.000 --> 36:55.000]  Clinton insider
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.000]  He's got big intel on Adam Schiff
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  And Ed Buck
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  And the satanic rituals that went on there
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  That have been reported in the diaries
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  Of some of these dead guys about the rituals
[37:05.000 --> 37:06.000]  And the things that went on there
[37:06.000 --> 37:08.000]  Alistair Crowley type stuff
[37:08.000 --> 37:11.000]  That's the bottom of the next hour
[37:11.000 --> 37:13.000]  And Nick Badgex always hosts the fourth
[37:13.000 --> 37:14.000]  Hour on Friday
[37:14.000 --> 37:15.000]  But I may co-host with him
[37:15.000 --> 37:16.000]  And take more of your calls
[37:16.000 --> 37:18.000]  Because obviously we're going to be taking calls
[37:18.000 --> 37:21.000]  Throughout this evening into firepower
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  That ends at nine o'clock tonight
[37:23.000 --> 37:24.000]  And I'll be up here
[37:24.000 --> 37:25.000]  I will be up here
[37:25.000 --> 37:26.000]  I've already got the crew set up everything
[37:26.000 --> 37:27.000]  I'm going to be up here all tomorrow
[37:27.000 --> 37:28.000]  Already working on things
[37:28.000 --> 37:29.000]  Going into 2020
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  There's so much happening
[37:31.000 --> 37:32.000]  The only way we're here
[37:32.000 --> 37:33.000]  Is your word of mouth
[37:33.000 --> 37:34.000]  Getting around the sensors
[37:34.000 --> 37:35.000]  Which is amazing
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  And buying products
[37:37.000 --> 37:38.000]  So I was going to
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  Before Paul ever came on
[37:40.000 --> 37:41.000]  Talk about DNA Force Plus
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  That's back in stock
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  With the CoQ10
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.000]  And the PQQ and more
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  And so I pulled a bunch of research on it
[37:49.000 --> 37:50.000]  I was going to do a whole segment on it
[37:50.000 --> 37:51.000]  It's our flagship product
[37:51.000 --> 37:54.000]  That I never really talk about properly
[37:54.000 --> 37:55.000]  And now this all happens
[37:55.000 --> 37:56.000]  So I'm not going to have time
[37:56.000 --> 37:57.000]  To get to it now
[37:57.000 --> 38:00.000]  But here's the folder of research
[38:00.000 --> 38:03.000]  Of just this morning that I printed off
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  Mainline science
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  Nobel prizes
[38:07.000 --> 38:11.000]  About CoQ10 and PQQ
[38:11.000 --> 38:14.000]  It regrows mitochondria
[38:14.000 --> 38:15.000]  In the brain cells
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  That nothing else can do
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  So your damaged brain cells
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  50% of people have massive damage
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  In the mitochondria in the brain cells
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.000]  I mean, Alzheimer's, everything
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  They will not tell you about this though
[38:28.000 --> 38:30.000]  And it's all here
[38:30.000 --> 38:31.000]  So 50% off
[38:31.000 --> 38:32.000]  It's the one thing
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.000]  Everybody should give themselves
[38:34.000 --> 38:35.000]  About 40 should be on it
[38:35.000 --> 38:38.000]  But young people should take it as well
[38:38.000 --> 38:40.000]  Because it has the PQQ, the CoQ10
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  And then it's got all of the other things
[38:42.000 --> 38:43.000]  Known as the Fountain of Youth
[38:43.000 --> 38:46.000]  By the Japanese, the Rishi Mushroom
[38:46.000 --> 38:48.000]  The Stragalus Root
[38:48.000 --> 38:54.000]  The other documented systems
[38:54.000 --> 38:56.000]  That all work together in synergy
[38:56.000 --> 38:58.000]  And we get a little bit of models
[38:58.000 --> 39:01.000]  Of PQQ or CoQ10 for 40, 50, 60 dollars
[39:01.000 --> 39:02.000]  That aren't even as strong
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  As an organic source like these are
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  Think about that
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  This similar formula was sold
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  For $300, $400 at medical clinics
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  Not as prescription by the doctors
[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  They're called clinical classes
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  That's what this is
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  Because people, they want to mark these up
[39:18.000 --> 39:19.000]  Four, five, six, seven times
[39:19.000 --> 39:20.000]  Like the industry does
[39:20.000 --> 39:21.000]  Well, people aren't going to buy that
[39:21.000 --> 39:22.000]  At a whole foods
[39:22.000 --> 39:23.000]  But if a doctor does it
[39:23.000 --> 39:24.000]  They'll get it from them
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  Because the stuff does cost so much
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.000]  That when you're dealing with 50, 60 dollars
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  Of product in something
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  You got to sell it for $200, $300
[39:32.000 --> 39:33.000]  For all your marketing
[39:33.000 --> 39:34.000]  And your legal and your bills
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  And your development and manufacturing
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  I signed a big two-year contract
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  On this to get even more of it
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  So instead of paying 50 bucks a bottle
[39:42.000 --> 39:44.000]  We're paying 30-something bucks a bottle
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  And so you can get it for 70-something dollars
[39:46.000 --> 39:47.000]  Discounted right now
[39:47.000 --> 39:48.000]  Nobody gives you this product
[39:48.000 --> 39:50.000]  At this quality for that price
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  $74.98 right now
[39:52.000 --> 39:53.000]  It's our most expensive product
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  And it's absolutely amazing
[39:55.000 --> 39:56.000]  I take one pill every night
[39:56.000 --> 39:57.000]  When you go to bed
[39:57.000 --> 39:58.000]  It's the best way to do it
[39:58.000 --> 40:00.000]  And if you're really older
[40:00.000 --> 40:01.000]  And got issues, take a lot of it
[40:01.000 --> 40:02.000]  And see what happens
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  It's documented to regrow nerves
[40:04.000 --> 40:07.000]  It's documented to create new mitochondria
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  It makes the telomeres last longer
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  It doesn't grow, it'll make some last longer
[40:11.000 --> 40:12.000]  Half full, half empty
[40:12.000 --> 40:13.000]  It's the same thing
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  The carburetor makes the gas go longer
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  It doesn't make the gas tank bigger
[40:17.000 --> 40:18.000]  It just makes the gas go further
[40:18.000 --> 40:19.000]  But it's the same thing
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  So DNA Force Plus
[40:21.000 --> 40:22.000]  Get it today and fund the Info War
[40:22.000 --> 40:24.000]  A total 360 win
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  Okay, go into Paul Watson
[40:26.000 --> 40:30.000]  Paul, this Roger Stone situation
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  I could be bashing the corrupt court
[40:32.000 --> 40:33.000]  I could be bashing the leftist
[40:33.000 --> 40:34.000]  The kangarooing
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  The Democrat operatives on the jury
[40:36.000 --> 40:37.000]  All of that's important
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  But now it's all about Trump
[40:39.000 --> 40:40.000]  Do you agree with me on that
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  And what do you think should happen?
[40:42.000 --> 40:43.000]  Well, obviously Roger Stone
[40:43.000 --> 40:44.000]  Should be pardoned, Alex
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  But this is just part for the course
[40:46.000 --> 40:48.000]  Every major player
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  Who helped get Trump elected
[40:50.000 --> 40:53.000]  Has been punished in one way or another
[40:53.000 --> 40:54.000]  Whether that be through
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  Vicious character demonization
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  Smears and cancel culture
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  Whether it be through trying to
[41:00.000 --> 41:01.000]  Sue people into oblivion
[41:01.000 --> 41:02.000]  Like they've done with you
[41:02.000 --> 41:03.000]  Or whether it be by
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  Literally imprisoning people
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.000]  As he said, this is basically it
[41:08.000 --> 41:09.000]  Roger Stone is what
[41:09.000 --> 41:10.000]  In his sixties at this point
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  It's almost 70
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  Yeah, he faces at least 20 years
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  In prison, he's dead
[41:16.000 --> 41:17.000]  If he goes away, he's dead
[41:17.000 --> 41:18.000]  That's basically the point
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  They literally want you dead
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.000]  You know, it was an all Democrat
[41:22.000 --> 41:23.000]  Washington DC jury
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  It was a never Trump judge
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  It was a completely rigged trial
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.000]  The media was against him from the start
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  The media was tipped off before the raid
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  And they tried to cover that up
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  So what did you expect to happen?
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  What's happening now in the aftermath, Alex, is
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  Not only are people all over Twitter
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  Celebrating his death, basically
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  Because that's what will happen
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  Even on Fox News
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  Chris Wallace and Brett Baer
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  When this conviction was announced
[41:49.000 --> 41:50.000]  On all seven counts
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  Started laughing and cracking jokes
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  About Stone's nicks and tattoo
[41:54.000 --> 41:56.000]  So that tells you who's in control
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.000]  Of Fox News right now
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  But yeah, absolutely disgusting
[42:00.000 --> 42:02.000]  And will we see the pardon
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  Will we see Trump actually follow through
[42:04.000 --> 42:06.000]  On something that he said
[42:06.000 --> 42:07.000]  This is going to antagonize the base
[42:07.000 --> 42:08.000]  If he doesn't, but you know
[42:08.000 --> 42:09.000]  He's let us down before
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  Hopefully he can step up to the plate now
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  Well, there's also this whole cult
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  Out there saying we shouldn't criticize
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  Trump in demand what he said he would do
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  That oh, we're undermining Trump
[42:19.000 --> 42:20.000]  No, we're not
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.000]  We got Trump elected, damn it
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  And I'm not going to sit here and see
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  My innocent friends sent to a damn prison
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  By these criminals
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  But I'm getting pissed, man
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  I want him pardoned now
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  He didn't do anything
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  And let me tell these leftist and globalists
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  Something you think you're invincible
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  All the crimes you're committing
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  This universe has a way of exacting justice
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  And everybody's waking up from this crap
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  Infowars.com
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  Newswars.com and Watson's got his great site
[42:50.000 --> 42:51.000]  Summit.News
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  Whatever you do, don't spread them
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  Because Judge Jackson's God
[42:55.000 --> 42:58.000]  Bow to her and her flying monkeys
[42:59.000 --> 43:02.000]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true
[43:02.000 --> 43:03.000]  But I'm here to tell you
[43:03.000 --> 43:05.000]  Most of those really weren't
[43:05.000 --> 43:08.000]  Predictions that came out of a crystal ball
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.000]  I could see where the globalists were going
[43:10.000 --> 43:13.000]  I could see what their in-game agenda was
[43:13.000 --> 43:14.000]  What their goal was
[43:14.000 --> 43:16.000]  And I knew that when they were setting
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  A sub-PD platform
[43:18.000 --> 43:20.000]  That they were really setting the precedent
[43:20.000 --> 43:22.000]  To take everybody off air
[43:22.000 --> 43:24.000]  To silence everyone
[43:24.000 --> 43:27.000]  To ban words and names
[43:27.000 --> 43:29.000]  And information on fake whistleblowers
[43:29.000 --> 43:31.000]  So that their false narratives
[43:31.000 --> 43:33.000]  Couldn't be opposed
[43:33.000 --> 43:35.000]  What the globalists really feared
[43:35.000 --> 43:38.000]  Was independent media and platforms
[43:38.000 --> 43:39.000]  In the future
[43:39.000 --> 43:41.000]  It was the model of Infowars
[43:41.000 --> 43:43.000]  As much as the information that had
[43:43.000 --> 43:44.000]  To be silenced
[43:44.000 --> 43:47.000]  Because they need total information dominance
[43:47.000 --> 43:48.000]  For their outrageous lies
[43:48.000 --> 43:50.000]  And the evil they're pushing to succeed
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.000]  And that's why keeping Infowars on the air
[43:52.000 --> 43:54.000]  Is now more imperative
[43:54.000 --> 43:56.000]  And more vital than ever
[43:59.000 --> 44:02.000]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson
[44:02.000 --> 44:06.000]  What is the level of tyranny
[44:07.000 --> 44:10.000]  That a tyrant will take humanity to?
[44:10.000 --> 44:12.000]  How far will they go? What's their limit?
[44:12.000 --> 44:15.000]  And he said it is the limit to which
[44:15.000 --> 44:18.000]  Other men and women will submit
[44:18.000 --> 44:22.000]  The answer is there is no limit to evil
[44:22.000 --> 44:25.000]  It is a bottomless pit
[44:25.000 --> 44:28.000]  We've been taught in modern culture and society
[44:28.000 --> 44:30.000]  That evil doesn't exist
[44:30.000 --> 44:32.000]  Or that there's no free will
[44:32.000 --> 44:34.000]  There's no devil or the god
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  But those very same people have all these
[44:36.000 --> 44:38.000]  Rules for us about speech
[44:38.000 --> 44:40.000]  And how we can dress
[44:40.000 --> 44:42.000]  And where we can live
[44:42.000 --> 44:44.000]  And what our houses can be like
[44:44.000 --> 44:46.000]  They just don't want us to have any values
[44:46.000 --> 44:48.000]  So they can run over us
[44:48.000 --> 44:50.000]  Oxford's banned clapping
[44:50.000 --> 44:52.000]  Universities in the US have banned
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.000]  21 gun salutes for veterans
[44:54.000 --> 44:56.000]  These people are dangerous cult leaders
[44:56.000 --> 44:58.000]  And it's time to reject them
[44:58.000 --> 45:00.000]  The globalists know
[45:00.000 --> 45:02.000]  That I will never willingly give up
[45:02.000 --> 45:04.000]  I've said it many times
[45:04.000 --> 45:06.000]  I will never give in
[45:06.000 --> 45:08.000]  I will never give up
[45:08.000 --> 45:10.000]  But I could give out
[45:10.000 --> 45:12.000]  And it's very very frustrating
[45:12.000 --> 45:14.000]  To see them committing all their crimes
[45:14.000 --> 45:16.000]  Against humanity
[45:16.000 --> 45:18.000]  To see evil running rampant
[45:18.000 --> 45:20.000]  Like this and to know
[45:20.000 --> 45:22.000]  That most Americans have already been
[45:22.000 --> 45:24.000]  Silenced in cyberspace
[45:24.000 --> 45:26.000]  That most Americans have already been
[45:26.000 --> 45:28.000]  Shadow banned by big tech
[45:28.000 --> 45:30.000]  And to know that most Americans
[45:30.000 --> 45:32.000]  Feel powerless and don't realize
[45:32.000 --> 45:34.000]  How much power they have
[45:34.000 --> 45:36.000]  By spreading the word
[45:36.000 --> 45:38.000]  About newswords.com
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.000]  Infowars.com and banned.video
[45:40.000 --> 45:42.000]  And that people are hungry for the truth
[45:42.000 --> 45:44.000]  Now more than ever and that if you tell people
[45:44.000 --> 45:46.000]  Hey, the banned truth
[45:46.000 --> 45:48.000]  They don't want you to have
[45:48.000 --> 45:50.000]  Is at infowars.com.com.com.com
[45:50.000 --> 45:52.000]  And banned.video
[45:52.000 --> 45:54.000]  So take heart folks
[45:54.000 --> 45:56.000]  They've had to censor everybody
[45:56.000 --> 45:58.000]  Because the truth is powerful
[45:58.000 --> 46:00.000]  And they can't beat us fair and square
[46:00.000 --> 46:02.000]  I spend a lot of time
[46:02.000 --> 46:04.000]  Reminding the Infowars family
[46:04.000 --> 46:06.000]  And viewers
[46:06.000 --> 46:08.000]  That without you we won't be on the air
[46:08.000 --> 46:10.000]  And I spend a lot of time thanking you
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.000]  But I really think you should thank yourself
[46:12.000 --> 46:14.000]  For keeping us on the air and really
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.000]  Changing the world for the better
[46:16.000 --> 46:18.000]  And raising the alarm as modern ball reviewers
[46:18.000 --> 46:20.000]  But something I should spend more time on
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.000]  Is just reminding you
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.000]  That these products are really amazing
[46:24.000 --> 46:26.000]  You've got that pledge from me
[46:26.000 --> 46:28.000]  But you've seen the third party test out there
[46:28.000 --> 46:30.000]  The air filtration, the water filtration
[46:30.000 --> 46:32.000]  The supplements are all
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  The very best you're going to find out there
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.000]  And you can't fund an operation
[46:36.000 --> 46:38.000]  Anywhere else that's fighting
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  The globalist this hard
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.000]  So it's not a burden
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  To support Infowars
[46:44.000 --> 46:46.000]  It really is something
[46:46.000 --> 46:48.000]  That is good for everybody
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  That stands for justice and freedom
[46:50.000 --> 46:52.000]  And makes your life
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  And your family's life and your children's life
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  So much better, so visit
[46:56.000 --> 47:02.000]  Your.com today
[47:02.000 --> 47:06.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:20.000 --> 47:22.000]  Welcome back, Roger Stone found
[47:22.000 --> 47:24.000]  The LG on all seven kangaroo counts
[47:24.000 --> 47:26.000]  Being well-rounded right in the federal prison
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  For the crowd of getting Trump elected
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.000]  For trying to be a journalist
[47:30.000 --> 47:32.000]  And get WikiLeaks like everybody else was doing
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.000]  Disgusting Fox News
[47:34.000 --> 47:36.000]  Never Trumpers joke and laugh about Roger Stone
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.000]  After court verdict
[47:38.000 --> 47:40.000]  Could land him with life in prison
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  I had Steve Pachennick
[47:42.000 --> 47:44.000]  He used to run the overthrow of governments on
[47:44.000 --> 47:46.000]  The actual assassination teams in the whole nine yards
[47:46.000 --> 47:48.000]  And said everyone's waiting for Trump
[47:48.000 --> 47:50.000]  To take action against the deep state
[47:50.000 --> 47:52.000]  But by not doing it
[47:52.000 --> 47:54.000]  He hangs all of us out to dry
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.000]  Because we're big boys and can take it
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  With the lawsuits and the threats
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.000]  And the dirty tricks and the infiltrations
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  And the surveillance and the attacks
[48:02.000 --> 48:04.000]  And the bank accounts being taken
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  And now the NRA's losing its bank accounts
[48:06.000 --> 48:08.000]  And merchant accounts
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  And now millions of conservatives are being harassed
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.000]  Online and having their rights taken
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  We need Congress and President Trump to act
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  I could talk about this evil court all day
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  But let me tell you the sickening thing
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  Is Chris Wallace going
[48:22.000 --> 48:24.000]  Oh, incredible testimony
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  That guy had a voice like Everard Murrow
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  Damning Trump's in so much trouble
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  And then it was just a repeat
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  Everything we heard that Trump did nothing wrong
[48:32.000 --> 48:34.000]  And Trump's like, oh, look, I'm winning
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  They sound like idiots
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  No, they got a bunch of morons that believe it, Trump
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  So they answer 1776
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  In information warfare and getting aggressive
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  Before things really commence
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  In physical 1776
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.000]  Whole Watson brought it up
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  From summit.news
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  Here it is, getwaypundit.com
[48:52.000 --> 48:54.000]  We've set up this impeachment inquiry
[48:54.000 --> 48:56.000]  As we look live inside the hearing
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  Unless Chris Wallace has any more tattooed news
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  Let me just say
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  Somebody sent me a picture
[49:02.000 --> 49:04.000]  If you Google it, you'll be able to see it
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  As Judge Starr said
[49:06.000 --> 49:08.000]  It's a very good likeness
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  Of Richard Nixon that is there
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  Right in the center of Roger Stone's
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  We'll try to get that
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  In any case, moving forward
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  I'm not a crook
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  It's not that one
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  There are no raised figures like this
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  I think the real key
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  To this afternoon
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  And this is obviously with a stone
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  Conviction and the testimony
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  The powerful testimony of Marie Ivanovich today
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.000]  And then he goes on to say
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  Trump screwed
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  A ambassador that he fired
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  Who wasn't even around when this supposed phone call happened
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  It's just insane, it's Trump's inaction
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  And Barr's inaction
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  And the IG not releasing this damn report
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  That's allowing all this persecution
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.000]  To go on, Paul Watson
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  Well, you have to remember, Alex, as well
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  The whole premise of this collusion
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  With WikiLeaks and
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  By proxy collusion with Russia
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  They never proved that Russia
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  Was the source of the WikiLeaks
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  WikiLeaks always denied it
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  That was just like received wisdom
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  That suddenly became fact
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  Even whatsoever
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  Basically, Stone just exaggerated
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  Some tips that he got, he never lied about anything
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  Because he was never in direct contact
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  With WikiLeaks
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  So the entire premise that this is Russian collusion
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  Is completely ridiculous
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  You also have
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  Stone telling people
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  And I don't know what he said to you
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  If you've spoken to him about this
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  But now he fears that he's going to be
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  Epsteined in jail
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  And it's not enough that they're going to put him away
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  For 20 years plus
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  Now he fears that he's going to be killed
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  In jail, so I think we need to get a story
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  That's exactly what he told me two nights ago
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  And he said
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  It's a miracle
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  The jury is seething
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  And hate, virtue signaling
[50:56.000 --> 50:58.000]  Just literally going, just like shake
[50:58.000 --> 51:00.000]  It's all just a big party
[51:00.000 --> 51:02.000]  And there's all these CIA and Clinton people
[51:02.000 --> 51:04.000]  And Obama people laughing
[51:04.000 --> 51:06.000]  And the judge is laughing
[51:06.000 --> 51:08.000]  And they've got a blown up rat outside
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  Crook, you're going to jail, lock him up
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  No one's allowed to support him
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  The police will arrest you
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.000]  There's all a giant show trial
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  Hell, the judge should be throwing tomatoes at him
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  And have him in there in the stocks
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.000]  There's Cassandra Fairbanks, let's get her on
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  Because a bunch of these guys said they'd come on
[51:24.000 --> 51:26.000]  But they're still in the courtroom
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.000]  Who knows if they'll leave
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  And guys keep checking it
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  To see if they're even going to let him leave
[51:32.000 --> 51:34.000]  Before his
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  Sentencing that will come up in a few days, a few weeks
[51:36.000 --> 51:38.000]  Senator Roger Stone a couple of nights ago
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.000]  And he told me he's scared they're going to abstain him
[51:40.000 --> 51:42.000]  Yes, I can't say that I think his fear is unfounded
[51:42.000 --> 51:44.000]  Absolutely, so listen guys
[51:44.000 --> 51:46.000]  Call Fairbanks too, call Biggs, call Jacob Engels
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  Call them all
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  I know they're probably still in the courtroom
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.000]  But I need them on immediately
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.000]  And that'll be breaking news
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.000]  Here's who actually hear what happened in there
[51:56.000 --> 51:58.000]  Versus people like Chris Wallace
[51:58.000 --> 52:00.000]  Celebrating, I mean you see him
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.000]  They are acting like they just won the Super Bowl
[52:02.000 --> 52:04.000]  Over this, not caring about jurisprudence
[52:04.000 --> 52:06.000]  Over the press, that was the capacity Stone was in
[52:06.000 --> 52:08.000]  Being sent to jail, not caring about
[52:08.000 --> 52:10.000]  Julian Assange
[52:10.000 --> 52:12.000]  This is so dangerous, Paul
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  How they've totally abandoned any
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.000]  Journalistic standards and any protections
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.000]  Even Politico has an article out
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  Saying it's time to name the whistleblower
[52:20.000 --> 52:22.000]  And saying when did we get rid of all of our
[52:22.000 --> 52:24.000]  Journalistic practices, it's the job of the media
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  To do this, this is incredible, Paul
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  Yeah, let's not forget that Stone
[52:30.000 --> 52:32.000]  Was the platform from Twitter
[52:32.000 --> 52:34.000]  What is it now, two years plus
[52:34.000 --> 52:36.000]  ago, he was prevented from defending
[52:36.000 --> 52:38.000]  Himself, he was gagged during the trial
[52:38.000 --> 52:40.000]  So that's the modus operandi
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  They do with these individuals every
[52:42.000 --> 52:44.000]  Single time, prevent them from being able
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  To defend themselves, the jury
[52:46.000 --> 52:48.000]  Was staffed full of Democrats, we did
[52:48.000 --> 52:50.000]  A story about a woman
[52:50.000 --> 52:52.000]  Worked for Reagan briefly in the
[52:52.000 --> 52:54.000]  80s, that was enough to get rid
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  Of her off jury selection, but people
[52:56.000 --> 52:58.000]  Literally, you know, in concert
[52:58.000 --> 53:00.000]  With the people prosecuting this were
[53:00.000 --> 53:02.000]  Allowed on the jury, by the way
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  John Podesta's tweeted about it
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  A few minutes ago, he said, just about
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  To take off on a long transatlantic
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  Flight in a middle coast sea
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  I think I will just sit back, relax
[53:12.000 --> 53:14.000]  And enjoy it, so there's this
[53:14.000 --> 53:16.000]  Big atmosphere of
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.000]  Worship and celebration over this
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  Verdict, they're partying over it
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  Tonight, Alex, you know, meanwhile
[53:22.000 --> 53:24.000]  Hillary, Comey, Holder, Lois
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  Lerner, Stroke, McCabe, they all
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  Lied before Congress
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  Directly, Brennan
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  The same, worse than Roger Stone
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  Who basically just exaggerated something
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  Nothing whatsoever
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  Happened to them because they're part of the
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.000]  Deep Stay and he's not, so what is Trump
[53:40.000 --> 53:42.000]  Going to do, is he going to act?
[53:42.000 --> 53:44.000]  Let me just show people
[53:44.000 --> 53:46.000]  The type of stuff I've got, I'm going to cover
[53:46.000 --> 53:48.000]  Up the phone number and the name on this
[53:50.000 --> 53:52.000]  But this is the type of stuff
[53:52.000 --> 53:54.000]  That I get
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.000]  I'm just not going to show it on air
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  You're reporting almost got Roger
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  Taking into custody immediately upon the verdicts
[54:00.000 --> 54:02.000]  The government cited you and argued for
[54:02.000 --> 54:04.000]  Immediate imprisonment
[54:04.000 --> 54:06.000]  Please be cautious about your comments
[54:06.000 --> 54:08.000]  Concerning private communications
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.000]  This is one of the lawyers, not a member of the press
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  Think about this
[54:12.000 --> 54:14.000]  They intimidate everybody
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.000]  Say don't name the whistleblower
[54:16.000 --> 54:18.000]  Don't say when they're putting Obama
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.000]  Officials on the jury whose husband
[54:20.000 --> 54:22.000]  Works in the Mueller probe, of course you're not
[54:22.000 --> 54:24.000]  Supposed to do that, that's not jury tampering
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  The press has a right to go, this is outrageous
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.000]  Look at this, they still stacked
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  The jury, Roger wouldn't
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  Talk to me about anything with the case
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  Except that he expected to be sent to prison
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  And he feared for his life because
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  It was totally, you know
[54:38.000 --> 54:40.000]  Because they were buying the lies and hating
[54:40.000 --> 54:42.000]  Okay, he's not even allowed
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  To talk to his former co-host
[54:44.000 --> 54:46.000]  Who then says yes
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.000]  Just ask for my pardon
[54:48.000 --> 54:50.000]  And here's the image free Roger Stone
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  If I'm convicted, so he's not even allowed to say
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  I want to be freed by the president
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  And I need to watch out
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  The lawyers are telling me
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  Because I'm doing what Roger said
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  I mean, it's the government
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  It's bad, it's the courts that are corrupt
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  Now, these people, some of them
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  It's the system that's intimidating us
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  And then Rand Paul goes no, here's who the whistleblower is
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  Everybody goes you're right, we're supposed to
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  It's okay, they were calling for my arrest
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  They were calling for Don Junior's arrest
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  Just days ago
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.000]  I'm following the law
[55:20.000 --> 55:22.000]  And again, Roger said
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  When they convict me, please call for me
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.000]  To be pardoned, I fear for my life
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.000]  He told Cassandra Fairbanks that
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  Should she shut up, now he just disappears
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  And maybe they'll be nice to him in solitary confinement
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  If we all just shut up and let him disappear
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  While the left all celebrate
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  Sitting their whole pile on the media
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  And rigging it, but none of us can talk
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  Or the judge will hurt Roger
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  That's called terrorism
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  That's called terrorizing people
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.000]  And I don't negotiate
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  Negotiate with these terrorists anymore
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  Paul
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  Well, let's not forget, Alex
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  Roger Stone is being made an example of
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  Because of 2020, they're sending
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  The message that you can't engage
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  In journalism, in media
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  In opposition research against
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  The Democrats, because again
[56:06.000 --> 56:08.000]  You'll either end up with your reputation
[56:08.000 --> 56:10.000]  Completely destroyed, you'll be sued
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  Into oblivion, or you'll be imprisoned
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  And ultimately, maybe you'll be
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  Epstein, so
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  You remember what Chris Cuomo said
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  I can read WikiLeaks, CNN can
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  If you read them, you go to jail
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.000]  That's what they're saying, and they've showed it
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.000]  We'll send you to prison if you expose
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  We're doing Alistair Crowley ritual
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  Sorry, go ahead
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  Chris Cuomo of CNN
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  CNN got tipped off before the raid
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  They can engage in the most underhanded
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  Criminal behavior imaginable
[56:38.000 --> 56:40.000]  If you dare do that in an attempt to
[56:40.000 --> 56:42.000]  Change the minds of voters in an election year
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  You'll be punished, you will be locked up
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  You've got a bunch of people in media now
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  On the Republican side, scared to death
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  About engaging with the 2020 election
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  On similar lines, because
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.000]  They've seen what has happened to Roger Stone
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  And others, so this is about
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  Bullying and intimidation
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  As we prepare for next year's election, Alex
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  And the Washington Post has the nerve
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  When you just pull that headline up about Cuomo
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  Democracy dies in darkness
[57:06.000 --> 57:08.000]  And they're the ones silencing us
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  They're the ones killing our free speech
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  They're the ones doing it all, and there it is
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  She dies in darkness, Paul
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  Meanwhile, they give
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  The most positive reviews of
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  Actual dictators whenever they die
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  The other thing I'm reading, Alex, is that
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  Normally people would get about 6 months
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  Prison time for this, but Roger Stone
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  Faces up to 50 years, which is basically
[57:30.000 --> 57:48.000]  A death sentence
[57:48.000 --> 57:50.000]  There's a famous quote
[57:50.000 --> 57:52.000]  By Marine Corps general
[57:52.000 --> 57:54.000]  In the Korean War
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.000]  When 3 million Chai comms had flooded
[57:56.000 --> 57:58.000]  Across the border and surrounded
[57:58.000 --> 58:00.000]  Marines
[58:00.000 --> 58:02.000]  More than 50 to 1, some estimates
[58:02.000 --> 58:04.000]  Have it, but the point is
[58:04.000 --> 58:06.000]  They were outnumbered, and the general
[58:06.000 --> 58:08.000]  Was told, general, we're completely surrounded
[58:08.000 --> 58:10.000]  He said, good, we can attack
[58:10.000 --> 58:12.000]  In all directions
[58:12.000 --> 58:14.000]  Well, that's the point that
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  Info Wars has reached
[58:16.000 --> 58:18.000]  And it really is epic, it really is
[58:18.000 --> 58:20.000]  Biblical, and we wouldn't have gone this far
[58:20.000 --> 58:22.000]  Without all your support
[58:22.000 --> 58:24.000]  But it's going to become more critical
[58:24.000 --> 58:26.000]  Than ever
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.000]  As the censorship becomes
[58:28.000 --> 58:30.000]  Complete, and it's not just Americans
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  But folks all over the world are completely
[58:32.000 --> 58:34.000]  Silenced when it comes to
[58:34.000 --> 58:36.000]  Speaking the name of a CIA fake whistleblower
[58:36.000 --> 58:38.000]  Or exposing a pedophile
[58:38.000 --> 58:40.000]  Or speaking out against
[58:40.000 --> 58:42.000]  Dangerous vaccines
[58:42.000 --> 58:44.000]  Because by Info Wars having its own platform
[58:44.000 --> 58:46.000]  That chet makes the globalist
[58:46.000 --> 58:48.000]  Info Wars Life
[58:48.000 --> 58:50.000]  Has done it again
[58:50.000 --> 58:52.000]  With undoubtedly our biggest
[58:52.000 --> 58:54.000]  Breakthrough yet
[58:54.000 --> 58:56.000]  Super
[58:56.000 --> 58:58.000]  Silver whitening
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.000]  Toothpaste, this is proprietary
[59:00.000 --> 59:02.000]  This is with the top lab in the country
[59:02.000 --> 59:04.000]  And it is incredibly high quality
[59:04.000 --> 59:06.000]  This is the best toothpaste
[59:06.000 --> 59:08.000]  You're going to find
[59:08.000 --> 59:10.000]  It's called whitening toothpaste
[59:10.000 --> 59:12.000]  But really it knocks out the bacteria
[59:12.000 --> 59:14.000]  It recalcifies the teeth
[59:14.000 --> 59:16.000]  It does so many things on so many fronts
[59:16.000 --> 59:18.000]  These beautiful tubes
[59:18.000 --> 59:20.000]  Of super silver toothpaste
[59:20.000 --> 59:22.000]  Are available at an introductory price
[59:22.000 --> 59:24.000]  Of 25% off out of the gates
[59:24.000 --> 59:26.000]  It's as low as we can go
[59:26.000 --> 59:28.000]  And they're going to sell out very very quickly
[59:28.000 --> 59:30.000]  Super silver whitening toothpaste
[59:30.000 --> 59:32.000]  Is going to be a hit
[59:32.000 --> 59:34.000]  I'm very very proud of it
[59:34.000 --> 59:36.000]  I want to thank my father, a retired dentist
[59:36.000 --> 59:38.000]  For spearheading this
[59:38.000 --> 59:40.000]  For the last two years and developing it
[59:40.000 --> 59:42.000]  It's 25% off out of the gates
[59:42.000 --> 59:44.000]  That's as low as we can go
[59:44.000 --> 59:46.000]  Because it's very very expensive to produce
[59:46.000 --> 59:48.000]  Get yours today at
[59:48.000 --> 59:52.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:02.000]  Waging war on corruption
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:04.000]  It's Alex Jones
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:06.000]  Coming to you live from the front lines
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  Of the Info War
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  Well, it was about three years
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  And two months ago
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:14.000]  The Chris Cuomo said
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:16.000]  If you read WikiLeaks
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  You're going to jail
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  And it's different where you're ruling God's
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  Roger Stone
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  Wanting to read the WikiLeaks
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  Is now facing 50 years in prison
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  Here is
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  Chris Cuomo
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  Our would-be God
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  Remember, it's illegal to possess
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  These stolen documents, it's different for the media
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  So everything you learn about this, you're learning from us
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  Remember, it's illegal to possess
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  These stolen documents
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  It's different for the media
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  It's different for the media
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  Remember, it's illegal to possess
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  These stolen documents
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  You see the Liars tick he's got?
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  It's illegal to have these stolen documents
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  He goes, he goes, I mean you wouldn't buy a used car from that guy
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  You wouldn't buy water and hell from him
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  I mean he's just a total con man
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  And he's there as a supposed journalist
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  Killing the practice of journalism
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  That would arrest Daniel Ellsberg
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  Daniel Ellsberg in the Pentagon Papers
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  Or anything for that matter
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  Paul, very, very dark days
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  And now I've learned
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  That they're flipping out in the courtroom
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  Of the fact that Roger
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  Said I want to move to get
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  Pardoned by the president
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  And so now they're saying
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  Immediate imprisonment
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  We don't want him out
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  With speech now that the gag's over
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  Lobbying for
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  Executive
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  Action which is his right
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  We want him in prison now
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  Well that was just backfire worse on him
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  Paul, I mean these
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  These currents are going down the same road Watson
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  Well obviously they want him in prison
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  Because maybe they want to epstein him
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  Trump needs to make the pardon now
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  If he actually supports and wants to save the life
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  Of his friend, that's basically what it's coming down to Alex
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  And again the point goes back to
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  They de-platform you
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  They demonize you
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  They imprison you or they kill you
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  That seems to be their modus operandi
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  Over the past few years and this is why we should have drawn a red line
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  At the gagging
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  At the social media censorship
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  We were promised that by the Trump administration
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  But nothing came of it
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  Then they said oh it's going to be on the 2020 platform
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  Too little too late
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  So we allowed that line in the sand to get
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  Raised over and now look
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  What happens where he's completely gagged
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  Throughout the trial can't defend his reputation
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  And ends up in this situation
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  Yeah I'm calling one of these lawyers right now
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  Keep going Watson
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  Yeah there's also a call to free
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  Rogistone by calling the White House
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  And trying to put some pressure on Trump
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  At 202456
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  1414
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  Tell them that Rogistone deserves a pardon
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  So again
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  What more can you say
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  His reputation was destroyed from the very beginning
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  They packed the jewellery with Democrats
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  It was 82 Democrats
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  There were a few Republicans
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  Who had once expressed Republican beliefs
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  Or once worked briefly in the Reagan administration
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  They were immediately
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  Thrown out of jury selection
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  But people with direct complicity
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  In the prosecution of Rogistone
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  They were put on the jury
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  So it's absolutely unconscionable Alex
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  And Trump needs to step in
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  Again this is going to rile up the base
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  If he fails to do anything
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  The most he's done so far
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  In any of these situations
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  Seems to be to tweet about it
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  That's nice but it's never going to be enough Alex
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  He needs to step forward and actually
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  Take the executive
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  Have the executive balls to make a decision on this
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  Hold on Watson I'm talking to one of the lawyers
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  Right now keep going
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  Yeah and now we've got Fox News
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  Which of course has been under pressure for abandoning Trump
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  Obviously now laughing
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  Cracking jokes about his tattoo
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  But again as I said before
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  This is about sending a message for 2020
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  There was no evidence whatsoever
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  That Russia was the source of the WikiLeaks
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  But they built this fake news narrative
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  That anyone who
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  Talked about WikiLeaks
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  Was engaging basically in Russian collusion
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  They saw Chris Cuomo there with the clip
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  And again this is about sending a message for 2020
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  It's about making people afraid
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  They do it through social media
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  They do it through YouTube for example
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  Not even allowing people
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  To name the whistleblower
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  Even though it's out in the media
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  Deleting their YouTube videos
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  Simply for naming them
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  So this is about sending the message
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  Don't challenge the deep state
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  Don't talk about this
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  Don't do any opposition research
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  Or you will be probably
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  Hey guys hold on listen stay there Paul
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  I need you to come back and finish up
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  I can't tell you what I'm talking about
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  Let's do this
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  A question was once posed
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  To Thomas Jefferson
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  What is the level
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  Of tyranny
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  That a tyrant will take humanity to
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  How far will they go
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  What's their limit
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  And he said it is the limit
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  To which other men and women
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  Will submit
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  The answer is there is no limit
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  To the level
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  It is a bottomless pit
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  We've been taught
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  In modern culture and society
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  That evil doesn't exist
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  Or that there's no free will
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  There's no devil or the god
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  But those very same people
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  Have all these rules for us about
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  Speech and how we can
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  Dress and where we can live
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  And what our houses can be like
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  They just don't want us to have any values
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  So they can run over us
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  And clap it
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  Universities in the U.S. have banned
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  21 gun salutes for veterans
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  These people are dangerous cult leaders
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:05:59.000]  And it's time to reject them
[1:05:59.000 --> 1:06:01.000]  Live from the
[1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:03.000]  Infowars.com studios
[1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  Show
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  Music
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  We are live and we're talking about what happened
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  In Poland while Alex Jones makes
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  A very important phone call
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  Going to get back into that breaking
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  Roger Stone news here in a second
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  That's right, that's absolutely right Paul
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  I am literally talking to folks right now
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  I can't say who, there's just tyranny
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  At levels I've never even heard of before
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  And I'm just going to leave it at that
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  I've got some reporters, I've got to talk to you real quick
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  And then I'll be right back on with huge news
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  For everybody, infowars.com
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  Roger Porte top link to us, very thankful for that
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  Roger Stone giant show trial came to an end
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  Jury, 50 years
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  Everybody's facing all seven counts
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  Totally rigged
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  And so I'll be back with you in a few minutes
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  But good news is happening, there's a global awakening
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  They're trying to intimidate us, Paul just got back
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  From Eastern and Central Europe
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  He'll give you a big report, Paul Jones of Watson
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  Summit.News, I'm Alex Jones back in about four minutes
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  Yeah, so
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  Poland had a massive election
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  Recently, and for the first time
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  The Confederation
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  Which is an alliance of conservative and populist parties
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  Was elected to the parliament
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  They've got a pro family
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  Pro-Catholic, anti-mass migration
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  Anti-LGBT
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  LGBT agenda
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  Which they're now pushing
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  On the mainstream centrist right
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  Nationalist party, which is the ruling government
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  In Poland
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  So we went to Poland to take part
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  In the Independence Day march
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  Which of course happens every year on the 11th of November
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  To celebrate Poland's independence
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  Back in 1918
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  Because for about a hundred and
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  I think it was 23 years before that
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  Poland didn't even exist as a country
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  This was a patriotic rally
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  But of course, every single year
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  It's demonized by the media
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  As an extremist far-right demonstration
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  For example
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  Weiss
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  Headline, bigotry and fear filled
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  Warsaw streets on Polish Independence Day
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  And basically they try to make it out
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  As if it's a march for far-right extremism
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  Complete BS
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  We had 150,000
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  Proud patriotic
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  Poles turn out on the streets
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  Young people, old people, families
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  Waving Polish flags
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  This was not a far-right extremist march
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  Were their pockets
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  Individuals within the protest
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  That were far-right were extremists
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  Yes, but a tiny
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  Tiny minority
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  Compared to the vast majority of people
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  Proud Polish patriots
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  Who were out on the streets
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  Protesting against mass migration
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  Protesting against the cultural imposition
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  Of the LGBT agenda
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  Not protesting against gay people
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  You have to make this nuanced argument
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  Because the media will never do it
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  What we have in Poland
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  And by the way, they've seen what's happening in the west
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  With the mass migration
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  With the drag queen story time
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  They are absolutely dead-set
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  Against allowing that to happen in Poland
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  So we have a bill in the Polish parliament
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  Which is an anti-pedophilia bill
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  Which is an anti-pedophilia bill
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  And now the European Union
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  Is putting pressure on to have that revoked
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  By condemning it
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  This is what the bill says
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  Quote
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  Anyone who promotes or approves sexual intercourse
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  Or other sexual activity by a minor
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  In connection with performing the position
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  Occupation of performing activities
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  Related to upbringing education
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  Healthcare or care of minors
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  Is liable to imprisonment up to three years
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  They literally tried to pass a stop
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  Pedophilia bill
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  Which merely said
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  You cannot tell children
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  To have sex with other adults
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  So you cannot put this
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  In the education system
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  We've seen in the west
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  The introduction of these LGBT education systems
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  We've seen sex education
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  For example, in the UK
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  For children as young as five years old
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  This is what they're against
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  This was one of the dominant themes
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  Of the Polish independence day march
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  Against the sexualisation
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  Against the sexualisation of children
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  Against them putting this
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  Into the curriculum
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  At the educational level
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  So for vice and other media outlets
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  To claim that this was a far-right extremist
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  Gay-hating rally
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  Is complete and utter BS
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  They don't hate gay people
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  They're not trying to revoke the rights
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  Of homosexual people
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  You know, put them in prison
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  Or kick them out of the country or whatever
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  That's not what it's about
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  And preventing children from being
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  Bombarded by sexual propaganda
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  The same as any normal
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  Thinking person would one in the west
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  And in fact, Christoph
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  Bozak, who is one of the confederation
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  Leaders, newly elected to the parliament
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  Outlined this vision
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  In a speech he gave
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  And we met Christoph Bozak
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  We met Janice Corvin-Micker
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  Head of the confederation
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  There in the parliament
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  We met other members of the confederation
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  This is what Christoph Bozak said
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  During his speech at the independence day march
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  The independence march is a manifestation
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  Which embodies the Polish spirit
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  We want independent Poland
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  A Poland rooted in tradition
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  We want Poland which is committed
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  To the faith of its ancestors
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  Committed to Christian tradition
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  He went on to say, we want Poland
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  Which is able to resist the pressures
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  Of the globalists
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  The pressures from the European Union
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  And this is what unites us all
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  The politicians we entrusted
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  That was the core message
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  Of the Polish independence day march
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  Led by the confederation
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  Which just got 11 members
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  Elected into parliament for the first time
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  That's what they stand for
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  What they stand against
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  Is the subsuming of their culture
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  Through mass migration
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  Through gender ideology
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  Identity politics
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  Because they've seen the effect that that has had
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  On other European countries
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  Like the UK, Germany and Sweden
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  And in regards to Sweden
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  They've seen the
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  Soaring crime levels
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  They've seen the soaring problem with rapes
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  To the point now in Sweden
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  And by the way the BBC admitted this
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  For the first time in what, three years yesterday
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  The same BBC
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  That tried to run an international
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  Media smear campaign against yours truly
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  But daring to say that
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  Malmo, Sweden and other of these cities
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  Which have massive problems with
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  All-Go-Zone areas
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  Have failed to integrate migrant populations
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  Now
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  The BBC's changed its tune
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  There was a headline two days ago
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  Sweden's 100 explosions this year
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  What's going on?
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  Not enough diversity maybe
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  So they're finally having to acknowledge the problem
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  Because it's gotten so
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  Severe in Sweden
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  One of the countries that accepted
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  The most migrants during that
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  Three-year period
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  Three years
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  And in fact it's so bad now
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  Wilhelm Agrel
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  Who is a professor of intelligence at Lund University
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  Not a right-wing extremist
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  By any stretch of the imagination
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  Is warning that the integration
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  Of migrants has failed
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  To such a degree
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  The violent crime is soaring to such a degree
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  Where now we have hundreds of
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  Grenade attacks every single year
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  In some of these areas of Sweden
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  The Swedish
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  State itself is in jeopardy
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  He said the state's monopoly
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  On violence, the actual token
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  Of a sovereign government
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  Has been hollowed out bit by bit
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  And no longer exists
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  He said the armed criminal violence
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  Is having effects that are increasingly similar
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  To those of terrorism
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  That is the situation in Sweden
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  And how did Swedish authorities react
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  To these massive grenade attacks
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  These shooting attacks
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  They reacted by inviting local
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  Gang members to pizza
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  This is the
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  Headline out of Summit News
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  Swedish police respond to shocking rising crime levels
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  By inviting gang leaders for pizza
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  Instead of actually arresting
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  The gang leaders
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  Who one of their favorite things now by the way
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  Is to rob children
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  That's a new phenomenon in Sweden
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  Paul, let me stop you. You've done an incredible job
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  And that was in my stack to get to at summit.news
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  And in fours.com
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  You've done an incredible job
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  And I'm going to go over here and we're going to break
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  I need you to listen to what I cover
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  And I need you to
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  Do a report on it
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  I have, this is the
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  Closest level of
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  Naked tyranny I've ever seen
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  I have just learned from reporters
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  The lawyers wouldn't even tell me
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  And I'm not going to tell you who else I talk to
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  Because
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  Well, he wouldn't even talk to me. They've said
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  You talk to Jones, period
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  You're going to prison
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  No
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  So during the breaks I'm going to be learning more
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  From other people that were there
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  Reporters, but I have
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  When his sentencing is everything
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  But when people hear this, Trump must take action
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  Congress must take action
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  The judicial and legislative tyranny is incredible
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  Paul Watson, thank you so much
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  And God bless you my friend for being a great journalist
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  Alright? Okay, thanks Alex
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  Alright, I am
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  Literally having trouble
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  Even forming sentences at this point
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  My head is spinning
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  Okay
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  Wait till you hear
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  What they said about me
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  Folks, I'm these people
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  Thank you so much for watching
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  Heart disease is on the rise
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  But the symptoms are there
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  Poor circulation and irregular heartbeat
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  Are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  My blood pressure has normalized
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  My diabetes has totally improved
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  Order your two month supply today by calling 866-295-5305 or order online hbextract.com
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  I spend a lot of time reminding the Info Wars family of listeners and viewers that without you we won't be on the air
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  And I spend a lot of time thanking you
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:17.000]  And raising the alarm as modern ball reviewers
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:23.000]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  So it's not a burden to support Info Wars
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  It makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  So visit infowarstore.com today
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  But I'm here to tell you that most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  I could see where the globalists were going, I could see what their in-game agenda was, what their goal was
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  And I knew that when they were setting a sub-PD platform that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody off air
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  To silence everyone, to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  So that their false narratives couldn't be opposed
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  What the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  It was the model of Info Wars as much as the information that had to be silenced
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  Because they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  And the evil they're pushing to succeed
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:20:15.000]  And that's why keeping Info Wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever
[1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't a drill, it's not a game, it's America in the Twilight Hours of 2019
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:34.000]  And this is so real, they're sending a message to anybody and everybody who supported Trump three years ago
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  That if you support him in 2020, we are going to bankrupt you, we're going to put you in prison, we're going to take your children
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  We're going to kill you and we're going to harass everyone around you
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  And a lot of folks that are supporters of Trump and you're in the arena, you're out there, but you're not in the arena like I am
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  Or a Matt Drudge-ish or others who I guarantee have been harassed
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  I don't even need to talk to Drudge to tell you they've harassed the hell out of him and everybody else
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  And Trump doesn't do anything about it
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  When he has all the damn power and is in the right to do it
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  And so here's the deal, I love Trump a lot, but it's like my back's broken
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  I'm being eaten alive in a pit, I can't get out and Trump's up there at the top of the pit, not getting me out
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  Now, I just talked to three reporters and several lawyers during the break
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  And obviously with this reign of terror and intimidation that's going on, I'm not going to tell you who I talked to
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  And I learned the same thing from one person after the last, that's why Paul Watson take over for part of a segment and the rest of another
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  And we bring up such huge news here all the time that it all just kind of gets lost in its intensity
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  It's like a log jam got broken up and just thousands of huge stories are coming down the pike here
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  Used to 20 years ago, we take one story and dissect it for months
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  I mean now it's hundreds of stories a day, the story that's confirmed of what went on in court today should terrify everyone in America and the world
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  That if we don't get control of our government and our judiciary and our legislative very quickly, we are going the way that all other nations go when they end up declining and falling
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  Now, I'm not building up suspense here, what I confirmed from multiple people in the courtroom and people that are specialists in this area, let's just leave it at that
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  Is so criminal, is so evil
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  Did you guys find that piece of information I wanted you to print earlier? Because it's critical, critical that we have a congruent stream of memory and consciousness
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:07.000]  You know, I think I'm just going to take a break at this point, I think that's probably better
[1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  And then I'll come back and I'll get into all of it, alright? But you know
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  These people are just absolutely unbelievable
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  Drew just gave you guys a file, you have that file? About four and a half minutes long, you got that?
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  Thanks, play that, play that, and then I'm going to go get this piece of information, and I love the crew, they're great
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  Here's the deal, most people in life or in media might spend a month getting ready for a speech they give or a couple months getting ready with a PowerPoint
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  And talk show hosts script out their whole show, that's why everything you see on Fox News is three days older than what we're covering with their own spin because it has to be digested by the big wigs and decided what can go on air and check with all the committees and make sure it doesn't anger any of the system
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:09.000]  This country lives in like a quicksand that's quickly hardening into concrete of tyranny
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  It's sick
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  And cowardice is what is allowing it all to happen, I'm going to go to this little report from when we bullhorned Hillary with an update a few weeks ago, taking action against these tyrants is the way to go, politically, non-violently to get the word out and let these bullies know we're not scared of them
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  Then I'll come back with the huge Roger Stone news and so much more, here it is
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  I guess that is no
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  I guess that is no
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  I guess that is no
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  Hillary Clinton is a criminal, betrayal, she's never a deserter, she's a tycoon
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  Hillary Clinton will never silence the American people
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  America is alright now
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  America knows what's happening
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  And if my heart is going to tell them that it's closing in, it's going to be fine
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  America is back
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  Get busy time.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  Get busy time.
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  Get busy, get busy, get busy.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  Get busy, get busy, get busy.
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  I guess I didn't know.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  I guess I didn't know.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  I guess I didn't know.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  I guess I didn't know.
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  I guess I didn't know.
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:56.000]  I guess I didn't know.
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:28:59.000]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  Whether it's a big company selling your data or a foreign hacker,

[1:29:57.000 --> 1:30:02.000]  There's a famous quote by Marine Corps General in the Korean War
[1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  when 3 million Chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded the Marines.
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:12.000]  More than 50 to 1 some estimates have it.
[1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:16.000]  But the point is they were outnumbered and the general was told,
[1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:21.000]  General, we're completely surrounded. He said, good, we can attack in all directions.
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:25.000]  Well, that's the point that Info Wars has reached.
[1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  And it really is epic. It really is biblical.
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:31.000]  And we wouldn't have gone this far without all your support.
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  But it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete.
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:42.000]  And it's not just Americans, but folks all over the world are completely silenced
[1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:47.000]  when it comes to speaking the name of a CIA fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile
[1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:50.000]  or speaking out against dangerous vaccines.
[1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:55.000]  Because by Info Wars having its own platform, that checkmate's the globalist.
[1:30:55.000 --> 1:31:01.000]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson.
[1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:09.000]  What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to?
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:12.000]  How far will they go? What's their limit?
[1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:18.000]  And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit.
[1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  The answer is there is no limit to evil. It is a bottomless pit.
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:30.000]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist.
[1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:33.000]  Or that there's no free will. There's no devil or the God.
[1:31:33.000 --> 1:31:40.000]  But those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress
[1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:44.000]  and where we can live and what our houses can be like.
[1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:48.000]  They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us.
[1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:50.000]  Oxford's banned clapping.
[1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:53.000]  University's the US have banned 21 gun salutes for veterans.
[1:31:53.000 --> 1:31:57.000]  These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them.
[1:31:57.000 --> 1:32:04.000]  Beto Roark came out dozens of times and said we're going to confiscate all your semi-automatic rifles.
[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:10.000]  And he got all the other Democrats on the stage, nine others, to agree and said that he was a hero.
[1:32:10.000 --> 1:32:12.000]  Think about that.
[1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:15.000]  Now those Democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control.
[1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:22.000]  Their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive drug dealing
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:26.000]  and incredible levels of violent crime. They know what they're doing.
[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  And now the Supreme Court's come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  for what criminals do using their firearms.
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  My goodness, ladies and gentlemen, this country is under such incredible attack.
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  But more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the Second Amendment
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:47.000]  and they're going to follow the original Bill of Rights and Constitution
[1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns.
[1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:53.000]  So you see a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens.
[1:32:53.000 --> 1:32:56.000]  Well, we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws.
[1:32:59.000 --> 1:33:03.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:03.000 --> 1:33:08.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:39.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  And I am a syndicated radio and TV host based in Austin, Texas.
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  There are a lot of new viewers tuning in via infowars.com,
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  slash show and band.video because of the terrible Roger Stone
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  political prisoner conviction of all seven counts facing 50 years in jail
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  at the hands of the Obama hanging judge who let Hillary Clinton off the hook
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  for Benghazi and the clear stand down in the deaths that happened there.
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  Shewell wrote in Manafort and others, but Manafort had actually done some of the things
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  that the Clintons and Obamas do with the offshore accounts,
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  which you could argue were illegal.
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  Still, he was targeted for political reasons.
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  Stone did nothing wrong.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  And DrudgeReport.com is top linked to our story and our live feed
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:19.000]  where we're breaking all of this down.
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  Now, I have some big breaking news here, and then I'm going to go to our guest
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  that ties into all of this in general.
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  And I'm going to do my best to lay this out.
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  I also need the article that's linked on DrudgeReport.com by Adon Salazar
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  about Cassandra Fairbanks, please.
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  I know that I had that, but I do not have it now.
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:55.000]  So if I can have that article, that would be good as well.
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  Thank you.
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  Now, what we've gotten from Trump so far is that,
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  oh, well, if he's convicted of lying, why is Hillary and why are all these other people
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  allowed to lie to Congress and to everybody else?
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  Well, I was there with Stone when he was trying to get all the WikiLeaks.
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  WikiLeaks was talking to everybody else but us,
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  because they wanted to be associated with establishment journalists and all of them
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  who loved him back when he was exposing Bush, but not when he was exposing Obama.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  And so what I'm going to do is we have a lawyer who is not Roger Stone's lawyer.
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  He's been his lawyer in the past, but he was not his lawyer on this case.
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  It's a clear distinction, but he's an advisor to Roger Stone, Tyler Nixon.
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  Who is a relation to Richard Nixon, people ask, looks just like him too.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  A nice guy, smart guy.
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:37:01.000]  He's going to be joining us at the bottom of the next hour.
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  And I talked to some other journalists that are scared to come on about what was said this morning
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  in the trial when they tried to put Roger in prison until the February 6th,
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  sentencing that the judge has done and what happened there,
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  and what was said about Roger and myself and you, the listeners of this show.
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  And I'm not building up the suspense of it.
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  I'm getting some documents, doing some research, collating those,
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  and I'm going to write a statement during the next break so that I get this precisely the way it is
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  because they want to arrest me and they're saying it in the court.
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  You've seen them in the news last week trying to get me arrested and lying about me.
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  I'm saying we had a grim reaper on the show to threaten the jurors, total crap.
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  They had a grim reaper on the show talking about Epstein.
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  They don't show you what I do though.
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  They just lie about it.
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  And so I want to tell you what these federal prosecutors were up to
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  and the different things that they were saying.
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  But report Roger Stone fears he'll be Epstein in jail.
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  That's infowars.com from Cassandra Fairbanks, another reporter,
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  and she's going to be coming on the show today.
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  She's literally in an appointment right now.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  I'll leave it at that.
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  But there is a reign of terror going on that we're not supposed to talk about this
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  and that Roger's not supposed to talk about it.
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  And it's so un-American and we just saw the back broken of this with Don Jr., myself,
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  and then now Senator Paul saying, release the name of the whistleblower
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  and release the name of the jurors that are Obama appointees and Hillary appointees
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  and are CIA.
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  If they had a rigged jury, we have a right to know.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  And they want me arrested for pointing that out
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  because they know that everybody knows this was a kangaroo court.
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  Wait till you hear what the prosecutors, the Mueller prosecutor
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  and the one from the Justice Department, two of them in there,
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  were saying about me reportedly according to these witnesses, legal experts,
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  and reporters.
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  So that's coming up next segment.
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  Now, he'll join us again Sunday.
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  On the Sunday, she'll be live for us at 6 p.m. or Monday.
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  So we get more time.
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  He understands this is breaking right now.
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  But it ties into all this.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  I've known Larry Nichols for 25 years.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  He did work for the Clintons.
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  He was a Green Beret.
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  He did a bunch of stuff in Latin America.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  He did a bunch of CIA stuff.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  He did help them get elected.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  He did help them do dirty tricks.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  He did help them develop the broken coalition strategy.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  And Bill Clinton in a memoir did call him a very dangerous person to them.
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  And he has exposed the election fraud so much more.
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  He has a lot on Adam Schiff and a lot on the whole Ed Buck
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  and the dead men, basically black men being sacrificed at his house.
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  That's what this is.
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  And all of that craziness.
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  So we're going to get into some of that.
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  It ties into the kangaroo show trial.
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  They're not allowed to ask witnesses, the congressman,
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:09.000]  what Schiff is up to, who Adam Schiff really is.
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  It was first Larry Nichols told me that Hillary was into the occult 25 years ago.
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  Now that's mainstream news with the spirit cooking and the rest of it.
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  So I appreciate him joining us via telephone.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  And Larry, we're glad you're hanging in there.
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  I know you've had cancer and a lot of other things.
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  It's good to have you back on with us.
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  I saw you in some of the news articles about this.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  Clinton, whistleblower, feds, probe, Adam Schiff dressed like Egyptian
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  at bizarre sacrifice parties at Ed Buck's meth mansion.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  And that ties into some of these other articles along the same lines.
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  Sex parties at the sex house.
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  We have photos of the two together at the house.
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  We'll also run some of the Alex Crowley footage we have of some of the garb
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  Crowley's in that reportedly Schiff wears in these Egyptian rituals.
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  But thanks for joining us.
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  Wow. What do you think of the Roger Stone situation?
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  Alex, it's disquiet.
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  I have born and grew about 25, 30 years ago.
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  It's coming. It's coming alive.
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  It's real.
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  And I feel sorry for Roger.
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  I feel sorry for anybody that they attack because their system is so effective.
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  It's the system we used in Arkansas.
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  You know, Alex, it's fine to be able all these years to tell you what's coming before it comes
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  because it's the system we built.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  Alex must go after with his attorneys if he has any availability at all of the money,
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  which has been stripped of everything.
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  But you know, it's called selective prosecution and selective persecution.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  Under the old way we used to be in America, you can't prosecute one person for something
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  and then not prosecute somebody that's doing the exact same thing.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  It's called selective prosecution.
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  Persecution is the same.
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  Now, they're coming after us.
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  And Alex, you've got a target I've never seen as big on your back.
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  Am I right?
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  You're a target on your back, and she's huge.
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  Now, to add to it, something that nobody's talking about, which is probably one of the biggest clues
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  of what's happening, Alex, is what's his name?
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  Oh, God, my mind just went blank, got it, funds all the mentees and everything.
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  Help me, your second man.
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  It's okay, Larry, stay there.
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  I want to get into SHIF and the show trial.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  We've never seen this in Congress where the Republicans can't ask questions
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  and just the state of the deep state war as a former Clinton insider that you see happening.
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  And then I'm going to get into the big news on what they were saying about me in the courtroom this morning.
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  Unprecedented lies, unprecedented evil.
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:43:02.000]  I spend a lot of time reminding the info wars, the family of listeners and viewers
[1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:05.000]  that without you, we won't be on the air.
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  And I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern Paul reveres.
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:22.000]  that these products are really amazing.
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third-party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration.
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:31.000]  The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  So it's not a burden to support info wars.
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:47.000]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:51.000]  and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  So visit infowarstore.com today.
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:44:01.000]  Info wars life has done it again with undoubtedly our biggest breakthrough yet.
[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:05.000]  Super silver whitening toothpaste.
[1:44:05.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  This is proprietary. This is with the top lab in the country.
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:12.000]  And it is incredibly high quality.
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  This is the best toothpaste you're going to find.
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:19.000]  It's called whitening toothpaste, but really it knocks out the bacteria.
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:23.000]  It recalcifies the teeth. It does so many things on so many fronts.
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:31.000]  These beautiful tubes of super silver toothpaste are available at an introductory price of 25% off out of the gates.
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  It's as low as we can go and they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:39.000]  Super silver whitening toothpaste is going to be a hit.
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:41.000]  I'm very, very proud of it.
[1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  I thank my father, a retired dentist for spearheading this the last two years and developing it.
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  It's 25% off out of the gates. That's as low as we can go because it's very, very expensive to produce.
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  Get yours today at infowarslife.com.
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:07.000]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true, but I'm here to tell you that most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball.
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:14.000]  I could see where the globalists were going. I could see what their in-game agenda was, what their goal was.
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  And I knew that when they were setting us up to be de-platformed that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody off air,
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  to silence everyone, to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed.
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  What the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future.
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:43.000]  It was the model of info wars as much as the information that had to be silenced,
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  because they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed.
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:58.000]  And that's why keeping info wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever.
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:09.000]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson. What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to?
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  How far will they go? What's their limit? And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit.
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  The answer is there is no limit to evil. It is a bottomless pit.
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:30.000]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist.
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:33.000]  Or that there's no free will, there's no devil or the guy.
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  But those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like.
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us.
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:57.000]  Oxford's banned clapping. Universities of the US have banned 21 gun salutes for veterans. These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them.
[1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:27.000]  All right, we're talking to Larry Nichols, former Clinton insider. We're going to go back to him in a moment.
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  Roger Stone was found guilty three hours ago. It's about two and a half hours ago.
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  And they're telling Roger that if he calls for a pardon and talks about the case in any way, that he'll be given a longer prison sentence.
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  Now, that's totally illegal. That's classical tyranny.
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  And I've just had to process since I learned this 40 minutes ago or so. And then I called and talked to other reporters that were in the room.
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:18.000]  I've since talked to others and I have a sick, dirty feeling.
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  It's disgusting that we have fallen this far and that we put up with this. I'm going to try to just briefly put this news out, talk to Nichols about the shift info.
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  It's all interconnected in the show trial happening, the impeachment, what he sees coming next.
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  And then I'll go through all this before Tyler Nixon, advisor and good friends with Stone, his former personal lawyer, joins us.
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  It's important to say he's not currently his lawyer or that nexus is him into the court. He's not Stone's lawyer.
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  So there are a lot of legalese here. Let me just lay out what I learned happened this morning.
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  Then we'll go to Larry Nichols.
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  This is what our country has turned into.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  And if you know about the Magna Carta 800 years ago and you know about the Bill of Rights, the Constitution and common law,
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  and what makes us different from North Korea or communist China or Venezuela,
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  it's just flabbergasting. But it's flabbergasting to have the National News and Democrat Party lawyers saying arrest Don Jr.
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  for saying the name of Eric Sierra Mella, the fake whistleblower, the CIA individual reportedly trying to overthrow the president with false statements
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  who Congress can't talk to because Schiff says so. And the Republicans can't ask questions.
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  Unprecedented. Never before in Congress. Never before in impeachment. Because this isn't an impeachment. It's a criminal coup.
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  So you saw them in the news last week when they were having jury selection and it was in the news that it was a former Obama official
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  and his husband worked in the Mueller probe as a lawyer. And I said, that's crazy. You can't have somebody on this.
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  His husband's the Mueller probe that all hangs on this stone conviction.
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  Their wife, who's an Obama appointee, ran a department on it.
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  So they had the Washington Post and others say, Jones tampers with jury. He needs to be arrested.
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  They had former U.S. attorneys and federal prosecutors saying I need to be arrested.
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  They said I need to be prosecuted on me for doing something that's totally normal that I still called three lawyers before I did it,
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  talked to more after they said, of course, it's protected. Famous lawyers, First Amendment lawyers, constitutional lawyers, criminal lawyers.
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  But I already knew that as a journalist. Then number one lawyer, Nichols.
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  They said I had the grim reaper on the show to threaten the jury. I had it on about Epstein.
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  You can see that part of the show. Everybody knows that. So this is their foaming at the mouth salivating to make something up like they've done to Roger
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  to put me in prison because that's who these people are. They're authoritarians. They're mad dogs who've been committing these deep state crimes
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  so long against America that they think that if we criticize the corrupt things they're doing that they want to put us in jail.
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  And I learned when I was being cautioned by lawyers and journalists, oh, look out the judge.
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:48.000]  You know, the prosecution blew up and said Roger needs to go directly to jail.
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  He doesn't need to be let out until February 6 when they have the sentencing. That's what's been said.
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:52:05.000]  He shouldn't be able to ask the president to pardon him because that associates with the trial. We want him gagged.
[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  And Alex Jones is trying to foment stuff and hurt the public and cause a clear and present public safety issue with his speech
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  because he's calling for people to surround the White House and demonstrate and bullhorn, which is totally First Amendment, America, heart and soul, to get Trump to do a pardon.
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  Totally normal. The left all lobbying for cocaine dealers and people and child traffickers to be let off by Clinton and he did.
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  I'm just saying, hey, this is wrong. Free Assad, free stone.
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  And so they then talked about how it's criminal, reportedly how I need to be arrested again. Federal prosecutors, let me tell you.
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:53:03.000]  Meet Special Counsel Art Moller's prosecution team. Aaron Zelensky was one of them, but the main one, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:13.000]  this is the Daily Mail reporting on it, was Jonathan Cravis, who worked in the White House Counsel's Office during the Obama administration, will be assisted by Dickey and Alpino.
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:25.000]  They used to have Jeannie Ray and others of Hillary's Foundation people running it. He has experienced prosecuting public corruption cases, including that of, that goes on.
[1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  That is reportedly who was calling me a criminal and saying that I want to cause violent violence and stuff. That is such defamation and it's so dangerous and it's done to put me in a jail cell.
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  What a foaming at the mouth piranha-like tyrant. Talk about a danger to the country. That guy, everybody else just pisses their pants and the judge didn't hold Roger like they wanted.
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  She realized how crazy that would look. He's been following all her unconstitutional orders, shaking in a pool of piss. I'm sorry, but they've all been doing whatever is said here.
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:18.000]  But she did issue a continual gag after the case so no one can criticize what a fraud it is. That's unconstitutional. It's been ruled hundreds of times.
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  Now the Supreme Court, not just other courts. So America, don't say the name of the whistleblower. Sit down and shut up and take it.
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  And don't say the name of any of these people. And don't talk about this kangaroo court or Aaron Zelensky will call for your arrest because you're trying to overthrow things because you want to exercise your first amendment.
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  These folks have been running the government for a long time and they think they're God.
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  And yeah, I got a big target pattern on my back. And hey, I'll probably get destroyed in the process here in the next few years, maybe even sooner.
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  But you know what? That's what men do. They stand up because the example they make out of me, they think is going to intimidate you.
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  I think it's going to inspire you to not go along with these people and to take our government back legally and lawfully and we're in the process of it now.
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  But the missing link and all this is the Justice Department and Trump because the government so full of these people that are arrogant and entitled and insolent that they really believe I should be in a jail cell because that which war criminal Hillary didn't get in.
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  We're going to go to Larry Nichols. I apologize for getting him on late. Huge breaking things this segment in the next.
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  And also, well, he's and we'll have him back soon. So we can really get into all this. But please remember, we're literally supported. The big thing they try to take away is money to fund ourselves.
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  Well, there's t-shirts, books, films, we've got DNA Force Plus back in stock with the PQQ, the CoQ tenants, the strongest, best form they're going to find out there.
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  50% off stores for shipping, double-paid, three points, gear DNA Force Plus. Everybody needs it. Let's go to Larry Nichols. Larry, I just had to get that out there.
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  And again, thank you. We've got a few minutes here. Longer segment coming up. Just get into the impeachment and Hillary behind the scenes.
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  She's clearly still in control of the deep state. That's now admitted. And what you think their next moves are going to be?
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  Absolutely. But let me say this out front, folks. Anything I say Alex is not responsible for. It's from me. And if the prosecution wants to come after me, come after me, not Alex.
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  And before we leave Roger Stone, here's what I know, Alex. Roger Stone goes in jail.
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  Now, folks, I dealt with Jim McDougal. He was killed in jail, especially after the Epstein case.
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  I fear if Roger gets put in prison, he won't be there a week. He will not be there a week. He will be eliminated.
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  That's me. I know these people. The impeachment, this impeachment was rigged from day one.
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:57:11.000]  What I have found out and have turned over to the prosecutors, Attorney General's office, is that it turns out that Adam Schiff folks wrote this script.
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  This whole script they're going through now. It's a subpoena trap.
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  He did it back when they figured out that the Mueller case was going to end up going nowhere, which was about halfway through the Mueller investigation.
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  Now, I didn't know this until a host I was doing researched it. But as it turns out, Adam Schiff has a hobby. That's what it is, Alex.
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:45.000]  Let's talk about that hobby when we're back in two minutes with Larry Nichols, because I'm going to shut up for a while, let him break it down, then we've got somebody in the trial coming on.
[1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:57.000]  The globalists know that I will never willingly give up. I've said it many times, I will never give in. I will never give up, but I could give out.
[1:57:57.000 --> 1:58:11.000]  And it's very, very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity, to see evil running rampant like this, and to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace,
[1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:27.000]  that most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech, and to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the word about newswars.com, infowars.com, and band.video,
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:38.000]  and that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever, and that if you tell people, hey, the banned truth they don't want you to have is at infowars.com forward slash show and band.video.
[1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:48.000]  So take heart, folks, they've had to censor everybody and shut everybody down, because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square.
[1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:58.000]  About a month ago, President Trump announced that he was going to move his domicile from New York City to Florida, where he's always said he planned to retire to.
[1:58:58.000 --> 1:59:09.000]  And the left got so excited. They said, oh, he's about to resign and leave instead of facing impeachment, and he's running to Florida.
[1:59:09.000 --> 1:59:21.000]  Well, now we know why the president did that. He knew the leftist-controlled appeals courts were going to say that he had to give up his tax returns so they can pour over them and harass every business partner he's got.
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:35.000]  They want to terrorize people that he's worked with. And by moving his domicile from New York to Florida, that gets around the New York law they passed to get his tax returns that are supposed to be private.
[1:59:35.000 --> 1:59:49.000]  So all those people out there holding their breath for the president to resign, in his words, we're kicking the deep state's ass and he's never going to resign.
[1:59:49.000 --> 1:59:55.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:59:55.000 --> 2:00:23.000]  We fought for the republic. We exposed Hillary's criminal activity. You spread the word.
[2:00:23.000 --> 2:00:27.000]  Trump got elected and a lot of good things happened, but now they're counter-striking back.
[2:00:27.000 --> 2:00:33.000]  America's never seen anything like it. The judicial tyranny, the fake impeachments, and now they want to put everybody in prison.
[2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  The answer is going after the ringleader's crimes and exposing them, and that's what Larry Nichols is doing with its confirmed mainstream news that Adam Schiff leading the fake impeachment, his good buddies with Buck,
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:56.000]  is there at least 16 times at bizarre sex parties where they did ritualistic mock human sacrifice. And that's in some of the diaries of some of the victims that died, at least three black men.
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:01:03.000]  Some of them crawling, begging as he would plunge needles filled with methamphetamine into them as a form of sacrifice, reportedly.
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:13.000]  Larry Nichols getting back to what you were saying, longer segment coming up in the short one. Please continue with the hobby of Adam Schiff and what your sources are saying.
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:24.000]  Well, absolutely. As a matter of fact, I'm the one that bought the fact that Schiff had been to Buck's apartment in his party place 16 times. Now it turns out, Alex...
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:28.000]  Larry, do me a favor. Back off your receiver a little bit. Back off your receiver.
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  Now they have verification 27 times he was at Buck's parties. Now the other thing is the time frame at which he's gone to. It's always of an evening. Plus, in seven of the events he went to, they were custom kind of parties.
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  And in line with Adam Schiff's screenwriting dreams, he would go as these freaky, weird, like you said, Egyptian type, beaman outfits.
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  The man is sick. He's sick. But don't confuse somebody being sick mentally with not being smart.
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  And as I was telling, he started back in the middle of the Muir investigation, putting together their phase two operation, which was to come at Trump from another angle when they knew Muir was going to not get him there.
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  Now you'll notice what they're doing. They're using this hearing to solicit deep state career people to come out, come forward.
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:51.000]  And as we found out with the quote, unquote whistleblower, if you don't have anything to report and get hold of us, and Schiff will scream right to you apart to play and what to say.
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:03:03.000]  And of course, they're making it very clear that they will protect you. Don't worry. Come out. Don't worry. If we're telling you to say stuff that didn't happen, they'll never touch you. We'll protect you.
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:11.000]  It's pretty insidious any way you look. And they hide it in plain view because Schiff's already been caught secretly meeting with a CIA Ramallah.
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  That's why they don't want to call him now. But the others, they just do it in executive secret session, international security in the dress rehearsal.
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:25.000]  Then they're going through three rehearsals, one secret, one in public, but the Republicans can't ask questions. And then now the third one.
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  So that's two dress rehearsals and then the final one.
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:38.000]  What is significant is where they hold these secret hearings. They're in the basement in what they call the step room, but it's actually where the cellar boys would meet.
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  You know, Alex, when I was with the bad guys and there was occasion when you had CIA operations that were what now is referred to as black ops.
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  They weren't called that then. But you would go into this basement with the intelligence special committee and select it.
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:07.000]  And that's where you were given orders to perform missions that were outside of the law.
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:19.000]  But we were told it was to protect America. So you did it. It's odd that they're holding these secret hearings in that exact office where those assignments were given.
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  Oh, they had Brennan on national TV and they had a meeting and they said, oh, the deep state. Thank God for it. We're taking Trump out.
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:33.000]  This is launched directly out of the rogue intelligence agencies that are much enough. Stay right there back in 60 seconds.
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  Let's continue with Larry Nichols, who again got recruited out of the army into the CIA down in Latin America, then got put with Clinton to mind him for the CIA before he got out of it.
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:51.000]  We'll finish up with Ed Buck and his Satanism and how that ties into the head of the Intelligence Committee, Mr. Pervert, Creepy Eyes, Pencil Neck Shift.
[2:04:55.000 --> 2:05:04.000]  In Full Wars Life has done it again with undoubtedly our biggest breakthrough yet. Super silver whitening toothpaste.
[2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:14.000]  This is proprietary. This is with the top lab in the country and it is incredibly high quality. This is the best toothpaste you're going to find.
[2:05:14.000 --> 2:05:22.000]  It's called whitening toothpaste, but really it knocks out the bacteria. It recalcifies the teeth. It does so many things on so many fronts.
[2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:34.000]  These beautiful tubes of super silver toothpaste are available at an introductory price of 25% off out of the gates. It's as low as we can go and they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:45.000]  Super silver whitening toothpaste is going to be a hit. I'm very, very proud of it. I want to thank my father, a retired dentist for spearheading this the last two years and developing it.
[2:05:45.000 --> 2:05:54.000]  It's 25% off out of the gates. It's as low as we can go because it's very, very expensive to produce. Get yours today at infowarslife.com.
[2:05:54.000 --> 2:06:18.000]  You know, folks, a lot of people ask me, how do you not get scared of these people? Well, my children don't have a future. We don't stand up for these folks.
[2:06:18.000 --> 2:06:25.000]  And so you got to be all in, just trust in God and give it to God. And that's what I've done. To get scared, I get mad.
[2:06:25.000 --> 2:06:41.000]  And I learned today that the prosecutors, handpicked by Obama and Hillary and Mueller, tried to claim that I'm planning insurrection and overthrow and public safety is in danger.
[2:06:41.000 --> 2:06:50.000]  And they want Stone kept in prison until a sentencing in February 6th. And they want me in trouble that I'm just as terrorist. And they already said that I've got grim reapers on the show threatening.
[2:06:50.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  I mean, it's just a pack of liars. And that Roger Stone shouldn't have the ability to ask the president to pardon him. And the judge said, no, no, he'll keep quiet.
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:15.000]  He won't talk about anything with the case. And sentencing is February 6th, but she continued the gag order in a case that's over.
[2:07:15.000 --> 2:07:23.000]  The deliberations, the jury, all of it. But she doesn't want to discuss who's on that jury, any of it. None of that stands up.
[2:07:23.000 --> 2:07:35.000]  But their answer because I won't bow and we break the ice on the whistleblower on the on the on the Obama juror whose husband was on the Mueller report.
[2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:39.000]  And then Don Jr. says it.
[2:07:39.000 --> 2:07:42.000]  And then others say it.
[2:07:42.000 --> 2:07:47.000]  Rand Paul says it. And now it's all embarrassing for them. Their answer is they got to keep the hoax going.
[2:07:47.000 --> 2:07:55.000]  And say that I want violence, you know, I'm the last person on earth once any violence. That means I failed.
[2:07:55.000 --> 2:08:02.000]  They're always trying to put that in my mouth that I want violence. It's like when Bill and Hillary had their black ops stage Oklahoma City and they all got caught.
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:06.000]  I've had all the witnesses on to get reelected in 96.
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:13.000]  They did it in 95 and Clinton admitted that's what got him reelected on Air Force One to the whole press corps. Look it up.
[2:08:13.000 --> 2:08:20.000]  They blamed Rush Limbaugh 25 minutes after it happened. That just means the voice of the people. They just saw him as the voice of the people back then.
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:26.000]  And now they see me as that. They see it as a fact totem. They see it as a logo.
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:30.000]  They think they could slap it down. They're going to win. That's why listeners and viewers understand.
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:41.000]  They've silenced me off of social media, but I'm still on hundreds of radio stations, some TV stations, info wars dot com for slash show band up video.
[2:08:41.000 --> 2:08:45.000]  And it's an act of true Americana Paul Revere resistance.
[2:08:45.000 --> 2:08:51.000]  When you spread the articles, when you spread the videos, when you get that information out for yourself and your family.
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:58.000]  Do it however you can via text message, via person, whatever, get the word out because they don't want you to hear these guests.
[2:08:58.000 --> 2:09:03.000]  They don't want to hear you. Roger Stone, former personal lawyer, who's an advisor and was a witness to this on today.
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:10.000]  There's a gag. He's not going to get into a whole bunch of stuff. He's going to get into every can I had to call reporters to get the info.
[2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:15.000]  I was being told, don't get into this. Don't talk to Roger. Don't, you know, a lot of stuff's going on.
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  I'm like, wait a minute. Don't say free Roger Stone. Don't say he wants to pardon.
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:30.000]  No, the judge says he can't even say that. I mean, whatever. Why don't we just turn it into North Korea and put Kim Jong-un in there?
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:41.000]  To bow to this ruling class of chicken neck, Ivy League, Un-American, America hating, flyover hating, Jesus hating, baby hating.
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:47.000]  America was never great and will never be great. These people are our occupiers.
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:52.000]  And they know it and they know America's awake and they're scared. So they're like, arrest him. Arrest him. Arrest him.
[2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:55.000]  Let's go back to Larry Nichols. Larry Nichols. By the way, Larry didn't want to do this.
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:10:01.000]  He's barely been battling cancer for years. Great patriot. He does an internet show. They've tried to shut him down everywhere.
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:06.000]  They persecuted the hell out of him. Don't just support InfoWars. Get in the greatproducts.infoWars.com. Check out his PayPal.
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:10.000]  Larry, how do people support the work you're doing? Because you're getting a lot of information out.
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:21.000]  Well, they can go to PayPal and it's NicholsLive.com.
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  And what about NicholsLive.com? Is that still your site?
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  Yeah, that's the site where you can go and see some stuff that I put out. I'm not able to put much out.
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  Hell, I can't even lift a carton of milk anymore. But listen, none of this is about me.
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:42.000]  Alex, this is about your InfoWars now. They're going to try to shut you down.
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:49.000]  But folks, if we stand behind Alex, and I'm not here to patronize or anything like that, I'm here to take you to the damn truth.
[2:10:49.000 --> 2:10:57.000]  Straight up nuts up. Alex, you and I and others, we've got to become the voice for Roger Stone.
[2:10:57.000 --> 2:11:04.000]  He can't do it anymore. We've got to do it. And just like Soros is doing, he's going around to the United States
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:10.000]  and they're down-ballot funding prosecutors and county sheriffs. Why?
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:16.000]  So that if anybody stands up in Nowhere America, Humnope USA,
[2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:23.000]  they're going to go after them just like they went after Roger, just like they went after General Flynn or anybody else.
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:30.000]  You know, this is done every day. What we're seeing Alex has done every day. Go to a communist country or socialist country.
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  This is exactly the judicial system they have every day.
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:39.000]  By the way, let me back you up, Larry, because what you're saying is so powerful.
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:46.000]  The son of the weatherman elected as the district attorney in San Francisco says he's going after all the conservatives, Christians.
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:49.000]  He's going to let Antifa beat up whoever they want.
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  We've got Soros and Bloomberg on record getting hundreds and hundreds of sheriffs elected, hundreds of DAs in,
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:12:00.000]  Reign of Terror against Trump supporters, and the Justice Department and Barr have not moved yet.
[2:12:00.000 --> 2:12:04.000]  Maybe they are, but my God, we need the cavalry now. Good Lord.
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:10.000]  And you know, Sam Houston is never going to, you know, even respond later once we're wiped out.
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:14.000]  And it's just incredible what you're saying. I've got Soros right here. Demands Fox News,
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:25.000]  Band, Ludacris Trump ally, Joe DeGeneva, because he points out that Soros still controls a large part of the State Department,
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  which he brags on record he does. They get, they had the head of judicial watch band last year.
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:35.000]  He, because he ordered it, they said we're banding it with Soros says from, from Fox News,
[2:12:35.000 --> 2:12:40.000]  because they pointed out he's funding the open borders with US money out of USA and Trump should cut it.
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:46.000]  My God, he's hiding in plain view with more power than President Trump still in the government through this crap.
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:54.000]  And then, and then Fox News literally jumps up in the air and puckers its rear end enough to make a diamond when he snaps his dirty fingers.
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:57.000]  My God, this is outrageous. Larry, go ahead.
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:13:02.000]  Well, and the problem is Alex, they know what they're doing.
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  And folks, they're not going after Trump. They're not going after Alex. They're coming after us.
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:16.000]  Change Trump's name to us, change Alex's name to us. That's who they're coming after.
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:27.000]  This is all designed to put us in, you know, Alex, you and I years, years ago said there would be a coup that we were in a soft coup.
[2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  I don't think your audience has ever even heard of a soft coup until we talked about it.
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:43.000]  And now you describe a soft coup covert incremental ambient soft kill moves in takes over government takes over institutions and then just moves with authoritarianism.
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:50.000]  And the signature of a regular coup is usually capital surrounded by tanks, but the signature of a soft coup.
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  The first thing they do is take over the media, the media, the media is all in folks, all in to help them destroy us.
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  If we don't fight now, there's not going to be another fight.
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:07.000]  I don't know how to convince people of this. It's over.
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:12.000]  That's what I've tried to explain to them that Trump getting in just roused the beast. This is the real fight now.
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:24.000]  And it's on. It's on. And everywhere you turn, they are working to do the big word submission, put you and everyone in submission.
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:32.000]  And it's a blessing to hear you, Alex, not go into submission, stand up.
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  Now, unfortunately, folks, you don't have a big target on his back already does, but it's going to get bigger.
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  But this is where I ask all of y'all out there. This is your battle, too.
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:55.000]  If you have never purchased or been a part of Alex's organization through his products and donations or whatever, do it now. Do it now.
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:15:03.000]  Because Alex is about the only front line we've got with a media platform of strength, of strength.
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:08.000]  Let me just stop you because I got to say this. I want to come back and get into the latest on Ed Bunk and shift where you think that's killing.
[2:15:08.000 --> 2:15:11.000]  And what happens if they do get out, Trump, how they plan to steal it?
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:16.000]  Finishing up with Larry Nichols will have you back soon, my friend. Things are so hot and I'm glad you're better than able to even do a show right now.
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:22.000]  But I just looked it up. I've forgotten this. He spent two million alone, Soros did, to get the Philadelphia DA elected.
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:28.000]  That means he now runs the law enforcement, the courts, and it's above the law in that city. Two million to run that city.
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  I mean, that's just an example of these people. And they already run almost all the cities, folks.
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:39.000]  And then they bring in the illegal aliens, and then they prostitute them out, and then they suck off their welfare money.
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:44.000]  I mean, this is a mafia takeover. And Trump, why has Trump not moved against him?
[2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:59.000]  MFullWars.com, tomorrow's news today. Larry Nichols is our guest, and we've got Rodgerstone's former lawyer joining us.
[2:16:15.000 --> 2:16:20.000]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the East Bank of the Mississippi.
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:26.000]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location, and rather than move it back to the warehouse,
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:32.000]  we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:38.000]  So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX Microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:44.000]  Over $1,000 in great off-the-grid gear, and a ton of bonuses too.
[2:16:44.000 --> 2:16:48.000]  In the best part, you're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200.
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:53.000]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more. That's myownpowergrid.com.
[2:16:53.000 --> 2:16:58.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[2:16:58.000 --> 2:17:03.000]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:08.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[2:17:08.000 --> 2:17:15.000]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[2:17:15.000 --> 2:17:23.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.

[2:17:41.000 --> 2:17:45.000]  Give yourself and your loved ones the excitement and tradition of slingbow.
[2:17:45.000 --> 2:17:50.000]  A new frontier in archery and truly modern twist on this primitive survival tool.

[2:17:53.000 --> 2:17:59.000]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson.
[2:17:59.000 --> 2:18:07.000]  What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to?
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:09.000]  How far will they go? What's their limit?
[2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:15.000]  And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit.
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:21.000]  The answer is there is no limit to evil, it is a bottomless pit.
[2:18:21.000 --> 2:18:27.000]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist.
[2:18:27.000 --> 2:18:31.000]  Or that there's no free will, there's no devil or the God.
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:41.000]  But those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like.
[2:18:41.000 --> 2:18:45.000]  They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us.
[2:18:45.000 --> 2:18:51.000]  Oxford's banned clapping, universities in the US have banned 21 gun salutes for veterans.
[2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:55.000]  These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them.
[2:18:55.000 --> 2:19:02.000]  Beto Roark came out dozens of times and said we're going to confiscate all your semi-automatic rifles.
[2:19:02.000 --> 2:19:08.000]  And he got all the other Democrats on the stage, nine others, to agree and said that he was a hero.
[2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:09.000]  Think about that.
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:13.000]  Now those Democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control.
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:22.000]  Their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime.
[2:19:22.000 --> 2:19:24.000]  They know what they're doing.
[2:19:24.000 --> 2:19:32.000]  And now the Supreme Court's come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion for what criminals do using their firearms.
[2:19:32.000 --> 2:19:36.000]  My goodness, ladies and gentlemen, this country is under such incredible attack.
[2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:41.000]  But more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the Second Amendment.
[2:19:41.000 --> 2:19:47.000]  And they're going to follow the original Bill of Rights and Constitution and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns.
[2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:50.000]  So you see a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens.
[2:19:50.000 --> 2:20:15.000]  Well, we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws.
[2:20:15.000 --> 2:20:18.000]  Welcome back, I am your host Alex Jones.
[2:20:18.000 --> 2:20:21.000]  Nick Beggins understands when he hosts the Friday show.
[2:20:21.000 --> 2:20:23.000]  Sometimes I have to preempt it.
[2:20:23.000 --> 2:20:24.000]  He's fine with that.
[2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:26.000]  I've offered him to pop on for a segment.
[2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:33.000]  His father died, of course, ever signing over the land in Alaska to the people so they could prosper from it.
[2:20:33.000 --> 2:20:37.000]  He was killed.
[2:20:37.000 --> 2:20:44.000]  His brother's been a U.S. senator, so he understands how serious all this is and this war for our republic.
[2:20:44.000 --> 2:20:48.000]  But you got Larry Nichols on former Clinton confidant.
[2:20:48.000 --> 2:20:51.000]  George Soros continues to quietly pile up wins in district attorney's races.
[2:20:51.000 --> 2:20:53.000]  Spends two million to win Philadelphia.
[2:20:53.000 --> 2:20:57.000]  So they're above the law and on and all.
[2:20:57.000 --> 2:21:01.000]  Twitter censors Larry the Cable Guy for making fun of Adam Schiff.
[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:05.000]  That's right, folks.
[2:21:05.000 --> 2:21:07.000]  Roger Stone versus going to be Epstein in jail.
[2:21:07.000 --> 2:21:08.000]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:11.000]  This is all on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[2:21:11.000 --> 2:21:14.000]  And I cannot tell you how critical it is to get these articles out.
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:19.000]  Mike Adams at naturalnews.com has been listening to the show and he's been talking to his sources.
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:21.000]  I guess that a lot of folks cover the trial.
[2:21:21.000 --> 2:21:24.000]  He's already pounded out this article exclusive.
[2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:30.000]  Prosecutor Roger Stone calls for immediate arrest and died with Alex Jones from the floor of the courtroom where Stone was just convicted.
[2:21:30.000 --> 2:21:32.000]  That's basically what they heard.
[2:21:32.000 --> 2:21:38.000]  They said from sources they were saying that I want an uprising and public safety and then we're planning something and all this crap.
[2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:44.000]  We just said go surround the White House peacefully and protesting.
[2:21:44.000 --> 2:21:45.000]  Harden Roger Stone.
[2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:48.000]  That turns into that credible.
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:51.000]  That article is going to go up on infowars.com.
[2:21:51.000 --> 2:21:54.000]  Some of the people here, I guess he's got quotes from I have a talk to.
[2:21:54.000 --> 2:21:56.000]  So he's just an amazing journalist.
[2:21:56.000 --> 2:21:58.000]  So just I just read that article during the break.
[2:21:58.000 --> 2:21:59.000]  Larry Nichols.
[2:21:59.000 --> 2:22:07.000]  How do you obviously they hope to wound Trump with this fake impeachment that Hillary slides in now she admits he's basically still running as we first knew.
[2:22:07.000 --> 2:22:09.000]  She's still maintaining control of the DNC.
[2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:11.000]  She's running the conference calls.
[2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:20.000]  Being her former handler from the CIA when they ran him and the whole mean thing that you got out of right at the beginning because you wouldn't be part of the cocaine deal.
[2:22:20.000 --> 2:22:31.000]  People who don't know he was literally like on the road to Damascus like Saul and literally thunder struck by God to start fighting the Clintons.
[2:22:31.000 --> 2:22:37.000]  And so you've been doing it for decades and thank God for you or they might still be in power.
[2:22:37.000 --> 2:22:38.000]  They're still trying to get back into power.
[2:22:38.000 --> 2:22:40.000]  They're staying behind networks for there with Soros as their sugar daddy.
[2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:42.000]  How are they planning to go with Trump?
[2:22:42.000 --> 2:22:49.000]  How are they planning to get her in and what are the tricks to look for and what's her Achilles heel?
[2:22:49.000 --> 2:22:56.000]  Well, number one, I was not believing in Hillary was going to get the race until I saw her pulling one of our own standby print.
[2:22:56.000 --> 2:23:00.000]  Larry, your phone is really a bit garbled back off that receiver.
[2:23:00.000 --> 2:23:03.000]  I know you got your voice and I do if you do, but you do it back off.
[2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:09.000]  Well, one of the standard tricks that we used to build Clinton after he won was the next election.
[2:23:09.000 --> 2:23:10.000]  He would say he wasn't going to run.
[2:23:10.000 --> 2:23:11.000]  He wasn't going to run.
[2:23:11.000 --> 2:23:14.000]  And then we would stage it to where people ask him.
[2:23:14.000 --> 2:23:15.000]  People begged him to run.
[2:23:15.000 --> 2:23:16.000]  He had to run.
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:17.000]  People were begging him.
[2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:20.000]  I'm seeing that signature with Hillary now.
[2:23:20.000 --> 2:23:24.000]  Now all of a sudden she's being asked and she's being asked and she's being asked.
[2:23:24.000 --> 2:23:30.000]  Hillary sees what I see and what you see, Alex, this thing's going down.
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:32.000]  If it's ever going to go, it's going to go down.
[2:23:32.000 --> 2:23:36.000]  She needs to be the head of it and she plans to be the head of it.
[2:23:36.000 --> 2:23:40.000]  So I will not be surprised at all if she's not in that race in a month.
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:51.000]  Now, we don't have time today, but as I've done in the past, if you have me on again, I'll be glad to tell everybody exactly what they're doing and what they're doing next.
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:54.000]  And you know, Alex, we had a hell of a good track record.
[2:23:54.000 --> 2:23:58.000]  Remember when I would tell you, they know I know what they're going to do.
[2:23:58.000 --> 2:24:06.000]  And they know I'm telling it, but they also know they still got to do it because you never stop the system when it works.
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:07.000]  They're coming to get us.
[2:24:07.000 --> 2:24:09.000]  They're coming to get Alex.
[2:24:09.000 --> 2:24:12.000]  We have to stand up.
[2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:14.000]  All of you, it's your time to pitch in.
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:17.000]  You know, it's great to sit back and listen to Alex and others.
[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:21.000]  But it's your turn to pitch in. Empowerers needs help.
[2:24:21.000 --> 2:24:25.000]  We have got to be the boys, Alex, or Roger.
[2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:27.000]  You see how they've cut him off.
[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:28.000]  They've cut him off.
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:30.000]  He can't defend himself.
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:33.000]  It's just like one of the babies in an abortion.
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:35.000]  He has no chance to defend himself.
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:37.000]  They've rigged that.
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:43.000]  And the other thing that we've got to do is we've got to stop them from coming after you.
[2:24:43.000 --> 2:24:51.000]  And the only way to do that is to make them understand that you have strength, strength.
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:55.000]  And you do, but we just got to get our people to stand up for it.
[2:24:55.000 --> 2:24:57.000]  But Hillary's coming.
[2:24:57.000 --> 2:24:59.000]  Soros is coming.
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:01.000]  They're fixing to drag this out with Trump.
[2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:12.000]  Now we're trying to get a plan through so that Mitch McConnell, we're going to try to make him force them to take this impeachment
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  into a Senate trial.
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:16.000]  I know that sounds crazy.
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:25.000]  If we can force them to go into a Senate trial, Alex, for the first time, the mainstream media will have to reveal to the world
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  what's going on, because they'll have to cover it.
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:30.000]  Oh yeah, it'll be rigged.
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:31.000]  Know that about it.
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:34.000]  But at least then Trump will be able to bring witnesses.
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:37.000]  He'll be able to cross-examine their liars.
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:39.000]  That's what you've got to hope for.
[2:25:39.000 --> 2:25:48.000]  Now we'll tell you on Mark, one of the problems Mark had, they did a poll about a month ago.
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:26:00.000]  And in the D.C. district court, the jury pool, it is Alex, the jury pool was 92% anti-Trump.
[2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:07.000]  92% of the jury pool is against President Trump.
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:19.000]  So Barr knows if he takes a case on Coney into that court, or even the New York Southern District Court, it's going to be rigged.
[2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:23.000]  It's going to be rigged, so he's trying to get a change of venue.
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:26.000]  He's trying to set up a cause for a change of venue.
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:29.000]  And that's what's causing things to be slowed down.
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:39.000]  But he has, through the FISA report, the IGFISA report, I'm telling you Coney and McCabe have got problems.
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:53.000]  But folks, if you want to know if Bill Barr is real, and he's not just another deep state actor playing the role, it's all connected to Andy McCabe.
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:27:01.000]  Either Barr comes out with McCabe with either impaneling or grand jury, or with an indictment.
[2:27:01.000 --> 2:27:09.000]  If he does any other course of action, then Alex will all want to know that he's in on the fix as well.
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:13.000]  And so now, I believe he's straight.
[2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:21.000]  I believe he is straight, but that would tell everybody the truth about him.
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:25.000]  So I know we're out of time, but I promise you this.
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:40.000]  If Roger Stone gets in prison, you'll have another case of Epstein, or better still, more exactly, you will see Jim McDougal.
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:51.000]  Well, I was told this before they gagged him, and so I can say it, but he did have people reach out to him from the system to turn against Trump, they leave him alone.
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:54.000]  And of course, he didn't do it, and so we got a SWAT team raid.
[2:27:54.000 --> 2:28:02.000]  And I've had the same stuff as well, and there are off record discussions, and I've had to sign on his closures and things like that.
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:10.000]  And I want to be able to meet with these criminals occasionally, so I don't ever break those deals, because that's not criminal to meet with the criminals.
[2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:17.000]  But, you know, I've had meetings with these mafia people's representatives, and they're basically like, hey, man, we're going to kill you.
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:21.000]  And I'm like, well, just go ahead, because you're going to get it after that politically.
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:26.000]  That's what this is all about. If I need to go down at the Alamo jackasses, I will.
[2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  You understand? Just remember, you're going to get it.
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:32.000]  You see how you're already getting your ass handed to you? You already see how long you're losing it?
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:37.000]  I'll be just like Gandhi when you take that club and split my head when that blood's running down both sides.
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:42.000]  I don't know how to beat your ass. Larry Nichols, we love you. We'll talk to you again soon, buddy.
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  Well, they're right back on the other side.
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:51.000]  The spirit of liberty is rising, and you cowards know it, and you can feel it, Deep State.
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:29:02.000]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners. If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system that we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up,
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:05.000]  this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[2:29:05.000 --> 2:29:10.000]  Bill Hyde here, and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:14.000]  that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:19.000]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[2:29:19.000 --> 2:29:23.000]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location,
[2:29:23.000 --> 2:29:31.000]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[2:29:31.000 --> 2:29:37.000]  So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[2:29:37.000 --> 2:29:43.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com. Over $1,000 in great off-the-grid gear, and a ton of bonuses too.
[2:29:43.000 --> 2:29:50.000]  In the best part, you're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200. Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more.
[2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:54.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[2:29:54.000 --> 2:30:02.000]  The globalists know that I will never willingly give up. I've said it many times, I will never give in.
[2:30:02.000 --> 2:30:05.000]  I will never give up, but I could give out.
[2:30:05.000 --> 2:30:14.000]  And it's very, very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity, to see evil running rampant like this,
[2:30:14.000 --> 2:30:23.000]  and to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace, that most Americans have already been shadowbanned by big tech.
[2:30:23.000 --> 2:30:36.000]  And to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the word about newswords.com, infowords.com, and band.video.
[2:30:36.000 --> 2:30:44.000]  And that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever, and that if you tell people, hey, the banned truth they don't want you to have is at infowords.com.com.
[2:30:44.000 --> 2:30:54.000]  So take heart, folks, they've had to censor everybody to show everybody down, because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square.
[2:30:54.000 --> 2:31:07.000]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson. What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to?
[2:31:07.000 --> 2:31:16.000]  How far will they go? What's their limit? And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit.
[2:31:16.000 --> 2:31:22.000]  The answer is there is no limit to evil, it is a bottomless pit.
[2:31:22.000 --> 2:31:31.000]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist, or that there's no free will, there's no devil or the God.
[2:31:31.000 --> 2:31:41.000]  But those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like.
[2:31:41.000 --> 2:31:47.000]  They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us. Oxford's banned clapping.
[2:31:47.000 --> 2:31:55.000]  University's the U.S. of banned 21 guns salutes for veterans. These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them.
[2:31:55.000 --> 2:32:06.000]  There's a famous quote by Marine Corps general in the Korean War when 3 million Chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded the Marines.
[2:32:06.000 --> 2:32:15.000]  More than 50 to 1 some estimates have it. But the point is they were outnumbered and the general was told, general, we're completely surrounded.
[2:32:15.000 --> 2:32:23.000]  He said, good, we can attack in all directions. Well, that's the point that Info Wars has reached.
[2:32:23.000 --> 2:32:29.000]  And it really is epic. It really is biblical. And we wouldn't have gone this far without all your support.
[2:32:29.000 --> 2:32:35.000]  But it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete.
[2:32:35.000 --> 2:32:48.000]  And it's not just Americans, but folks all over the world are completely silenced when it comes to speaking the name of a CIA fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile or speaking out against dangerous vaccines.
[2:32:48.000 --> 2:32:53.000]  Because by Info Wars having its own platform that checkmates the globalist.
[2:33:19.000 --> 2:33:26.000]  You know, you go see an epic movie that breaks any Western into the badly ugly. It's basically perfectly done.
[2:33:26.000 --> 2:33:35.000]  It has that unreality that makes it reality. You think about the epic things that have happened in human history that that's trying to mirror.
[2:33:35.000 --> 2:33:42.000]  You hear the music set to it and then you live. Turn it back up for a moment. In a time just like this.
[2:33:42.000 --> 2:33:49.000]  Turn it back up a little bit, please. And you think, wow, we're living an epic time just like our forebears did.
[2:33:49.000 --> 2:33:54.000]  There's these times that come along in history and we're in one right now. Now, here's what's going to happen.
[2:33:54.000 --> 2:34:02.000]  I'm going to host the fourth hour. It's Tyler Nixon. Roger Stone's confidant, consigliore, a former lawyer, is going to be coming on exclusively.
[2:34:02.000 --> 2:34:06.000]  He's with Roger right now. They're debriefing and things.
[2:34:06.000 --> 2:34:17.000]  And so none of this you're going to hear is from Roger Stone. But I got to tell you, it doesn't scare me to have those federal prosecutors.
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:23.000]  They're not federal prosecutors. They were put there by criminals and sorrows in the deep state.
[2:34:23.000 --> 2:34:28.000]  You know, that little tin badge and all that stuff they got, they work with the folks that hate America.
[2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:37.000]  I represent America and I've proven it. And I'm not up here on some high horse either. I'm just not here to screw your family over.
[2:34:37.000 --> 2:34:43.000]  And I'm not scared of a bunch of thugs. They want to intimidate everybody. That's what this stone conviction is about.
[2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:53.000]  They want to intimidate the press. And at some point, somebody's got to stand up and take licks just like our forebears did.
[2:34:53.000 --> 2:35:00.000]  They need to stop. Barr needs to start prosecuting some people. They already had deals offered to them as just quit running the country in the ground.
[2:35:00.000 --> 2:35:06.000]  Stop siding with the chai comms. Stop trying to teach five-year-old boys to cut their penises off.
[2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:14.000]  And we'll leave you alone. You can take your stolen money. And I even sit on air. If Barr can get him to do that, great, because I don't want a war.
[2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:22.000]  They can't stop. Look at chef. That's not just Nichols saying that. That's in the news. He was at all those parties with Ed Buck.
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:32.000]  These are a bunch of drug addict perverts. Look at chef. And if you've ever known about million-year-old people that get power, they think they're invincible.
[2:35:32.000 --> 2:35:45.000]  I am human. I am frail. I am not invincible. My body's frail. My spirit's strong, though. And I'm not afraid of these people.
[2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:54.000]  And I want to say this again. If I get destroyed, I didn't lose. I won.
[2:35:54.000 --> 2:36:03.000]  If I get to go through life and die when I'm 90 years old, my great-grandkids around me and my grandchildren, my children, I win.
[2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:13.000]  But I'm willing to pay everything, every drop of blood. I'm willing to be imprisoned. I'm willing to be tortured, anything.
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:20.000]  Because they're hurting children and these people are devil worshipers. And I'm like a heat-seeking political missile.
[2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:29.000]  I come in under their attacks and I guide myself into their attacks. They pop the radar up. They've got their guns trying to take me down.
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:43.000]  And I go into the flak because there's no doing this at 10% or 50%. You're going to fight tyranny. You've got to go in at 110%.
[2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:50.000]  I remember growing up here in coach, I said 110%. I thought that was silly. But as you grow up and learn more, you can always do more than you thought you could.
[2:36:50.000 --> 2:37:00.000]  Everybody has a physical governor in them. That's where there's the confirmed stories of little women when their baby's screaming, caught in the car, and a woman picks up the car.
[2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:07.000]  Now, she may blow out every disc in her back, but she picks the car up.
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:13.000]  That's the same thing, ladies and gentlemen. We've got to get this car off our children.
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:20.000]  And the starts were saying, listen, I don't know how this is going to end. Do you want to attack me, sue me, try to plant child porn on me?
[2:37:20.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  You're the devil worshiper. I'm not. And God's watching. God knows I'm not involved in what you're involved in.
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:30.000]  And you know what? I'm betting on God. So with God, because, you know, I've done evil stuff, folks.
[2:37:30.000 --> 2:37:34.000]  Before I knew better, I paid for abortions and stuff when I was in high school.
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:39.000]  My dad caught me once stealing money out of his wallet for an abortion.
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:45.000]  He said, God damn it, stop killing my grandkids. And excuse me, using that word. That's what he said to me.
[2:37:45.000 --> 2:37:51.000]  And I said, dad, I won't do it again. And the next time I got a woman pregnant many years later, I had the baby and that's my son.
[2:37:51.000 --> 2:37:57.000]  I was celibate for years because I wasn't having a good time out there being promiscuous and all the rest of it.
[2:37:57.000 --> 2:38:04.000]  But the point is, is that if God needs to pick me up and just throw me into those people and it breaks every bone in my body, that's what God wants.
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:11.000]  And I'm willing. I'm saying, you want me destroyed in the process. I'm all yours. Doesn't mean I want it.
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:17.000]  But you know what? If that's what God wants, then let's just feed me into that wood chipper. Let's get it going.
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:38.000]  Because I'm not going to sit here and watch these globalists hurt more innocent people.
[2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  I mean, we're really going to let Ed Buck and people like that run our lives. Is that really who we are?
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:52.000]  You know, it hurts my feelings that they've got people so corrupt that they sit there in a courtroom and say, we want Alex Jones arrested.
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:39:01.000]  He's calling for insurrection and overthrow. When I said no damn such thing, all I said was we should call for Roger Stone's pardon.
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:14.000]  And these same slime bags had federal prosecutors in the Washington Post put their name to it and say, Jones is a criminal and needs to be indicted like a mafia don for trying to intimidate a jury.
[2:39:14.000 --> 2:39:22.000]  When they knew damn well, that was upside down world.
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:35.000]  You imagine those soft, stupid lawyers who think they're God and think they're invincible and who've committed all these horrible acts against justice and then they think that they're going to beat us in the end.
[2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:46.000]  All that matters is the journey and the spiritual decision to not fear them and to start fearing God.
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:59.000]  And people fear the fear of God. People feel the fear of God when they're not aligned with God. You love God, you're not a devil or a spur, but you get in God's presence and you feel the fear because you're not doing what you're supposed to do.
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:06.000]  But let me tell you, when you challenge evil and when you're fearless, you don't even feel fear of God anymore.
[2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:28.000]  You feel power like you've never imagined and destiny and piercing understanding and so much energy and will that all you want to do is do what that spirit commands you to do.
[2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:34.000]  And I know I'm already with that spirit forever. I know it.
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:40.000]  And it's like literally taking me over molecule by spiritual molecule.
[2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:51.000]  And then you get deeper. It's unbelievable that anyone would not want to be with God and the common sense and the justice and anything corrupt or evil that I was ever into.
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:41:00.000]  Now is a joke and I'm pulling away by light years away from the devil accelerating away Satan's behind me.
[2:41:00.000 --> 2:41:13.000]  And I just want to take my children and your children and all these wonderful spirits that are good, gentle creatures with us into the universe forever and justice and freedom and away from these fallen twisted entities.
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:17.000]  Let's get out of here. Let's go get behind me Satan.
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:24.000]  Listen to what Christ said. Think how hardcore that is. Get behind me. Get out of my way. I'm leaving. I'm jumping. I'm gone.
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:34.000]  Away from Ed Buck. Away from Adam Schiff. Away from Alistair Crowley. Away from Satan. Away from Hillary Clinton. Away, away, away, away, away.
[2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:40.000]  We want to go away. We want to leave you. We want you out of our presence.
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:55.000]  All right, I want to give you guys a chance because I'm really tempted but I need to spend some time with the family. I got a lot of big projects. I'm up here working tomorrow already on projects and plans and big things to fight the globalist.
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:42:06.000]  And I'm excited about all this. Get ready to sell my house so I can fund these projects, which is I'm glad to do. It's just that's what that energy is stored up to do.
[2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:17.000]  But I want money because it's a weapon system and it's because I can block these enemies' attacks with it and then I can carry out operations against them.
[2:42:17.000 --> 2:42:23.000]  So we got products you need. Everybody should get the DNA force. Everybody should get X2. We got great toothpaste. It's all amazing.
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:37.000]  M4store.com. We've got the Black Friday specials. Everybody just expects giant cells all the time. That's just what it is, basically. Those tough cells out. M4store.com. I'm going to leave it there. But if you don't see that we're the tip of the spear on the side, guys, the enemy absolutely fears us because we don't fear them.
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:55.000]  I mean, seriously. They have no idea. God, it's going to get you. Don't you worry, globalist. Let me get the number out.
[2:42:55.000 --> 2:43:08.000]  Toto Rourke came out dozens of times and said, we're going to confiscate all your semi-automatic rifles. And he got all the other Democrats on the stage, nine others, to agree and said that he was a hero. Think about that.
[2:43:08.000 --> 2:43:21.000]  Now, those Democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control. Their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime.
[2:43:21.000 --> 2:43:35.000]  They know what they're doing. And now the Supreme Court's come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion for what criminals do using their firearms. My goodness, ladies and gentlemen, this country is under such incredible attack.
[2:43:35.000 --> 2:43:47.000]  But more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the Second Amendment and they're going to follow the original Bill of Rights and Constitution and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns.
[2:43:47.000 --> 2:43:55.000]  So you see a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens. Well, we can ignore all your unconstitutional laws.
[2:43:55.000 --> 2:44:04.000]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true, but I'm here to tell you that most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball.
[2:44:04.000 --> 2:44:11.000]  I could see where the globalists were going. I could see what their in-game agenda was, what their goal was.
[2:44:11.000 --> 2:44:29.000]  And I knew that when they were setting us up to be de-platformed that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody off air, to silence everyone, to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed.
[2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:46.000]  What the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future. It was the model of info wars as much as the information that had to be silenced because they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed.
[2:44:46.000 --> 2:44:55.000]  And that's why keeping info wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever.
[2:44:55.000 --> 2:45:06.000]  I spend a lot of time reminding the info wars family of listeners and viewers that without you we won't be on the air and I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[2:45:06.000 --> 2:45:14.000]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reviewers.
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:21.000]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[2:45:21.000 --> 2:45:26.000]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration.
[2:45:26.000 --> 2:45:36.000]  The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there and you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:40.000]  So it's not a burden to support info wars.
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:51.000]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.

[2:46:51.000 --> 2:46:55.000]  infowars.com forward slash show.

[2:47:25.000 --> 2:47:54.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to take your phone calls.
[2:47:54.000 --> 2:48:01.000]  I'd like to take your phone calls, ladies and gentlemen, coming up and get your take
[2:48:01.000 --> 2:48:04.000]  on Roger Stone being convicted of the show trial.
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:10.000]  All the rest of this insanity that's unfolding, 877-789-2539, 877-789.
[2:48:10.000 --> 2:48:15.000]  Alex, specifically on Roger Stone, the fake impeachment, all of it.
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:17.000]  When does Trump go on the offense?
[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:19.000]  How many people will they let them railroad?
[2:48:19.000 --> 2:48:25.000]  How many jurors all admitted the prosecutors in there calling for my arrest, Stone to be
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:30.000]  put in jail for saying he wants a pardon, saying he violated the gag order, which you didn't
[2:48:30.000 --> 2:48:31.000]  do.
[2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:32.000]  It's all insane.
[2:48:32.000 --> 2:48:35.000]  877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[2:48:35.000 --> 2:48:41.000]  Let's go to a little bit of a press conference where Trump was talking about impeachment
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:42.000]  and the rest of it.
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:44.000]  And where is Trump talking about Roger Stone?
[2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:45.000]  We've got the tweets.
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:53.000]  I understand he's going to get quote, sentenced in February a few months, but I mean, Trump
[2:48:53.000 --> 2:48:55.000]  needs to come out and say he's innocent.
[2:48:55.000 --> 2:48:56.000]  He is innocent.
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:48:57.000]  These things are kangaroo.
[2:48:57.000 --> 2:49:01.000]  Here's the president on the other kangaroo trial going on with Shiffy Shiff.
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:04.000]  It's totally, nobody's ever had such horrible due process.
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:06.000]  There was no due process.
[2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:11.000]  And I think it's considered a joke all over Washington and all over the world.
[2:49:11.000 --> 2:49:14.000]  The Republicans are given no due process whatsoever.
[2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:16.000]  We're not allowed to do anything.
[2:49:16.000 --> 2:49:18.000]  It's a disgrace what's happening.
[2:49:18.000 --> 2:49:19.000]  But you know what?
[2:49:19.000 --> 2:49:22.000]  The American public understands it, and that's why the poll numbers are so good, and that's
[2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:24.000]  why other things are so good.
[2:49:24.000 --> 2:49:28.000]  What they're doing in Washington with that hearing, and by the way, it's a political
[2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:29.000]  process.
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:30.000]  It's not a legal process.
[2:49:30.000 --> 2:49:34.000]  So if I have somebody saying I'm allowed to speak up, if somebody says about me, we're
[2:49:34.000 --> 2:49:37.000]  not allowed to have any kind of representation.
[2:49:37.000 --> 2:49:40.000]  We're not allowed to have almost anything.
[2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:42.000]  And nobody's seen anything like it.
[2:49:42.000 --> 2:49:46.000]  In the history of our country, there has never been a disgrace like what's going on right
[2:49:46.000 --> 2:49:47.000]  now.
[2:49:47.000 --> 2:49:48.000]  So you know what?
[2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:50.000]  I have the right to speak.
[2:49:50.000 --> 2:49:53.000]  I have freedom of speech, just as other people do.
[2:49:53.000 --> 2:49:55.000]  But they've taken away the Republicans' rights.
[2:49:55.000 --> 2:50:00.000]  And I watched today as certain very talented people wanted to ask questions, and they weren't
[2:50:00.000 --> 2:50:02.000]  even allowed to ask questions.
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:04.000]  Republicans, they weren't allowed to ask questions.
[2:50:04.000 --> 2:50:06.000]  It's a very sad thing.
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:07.000]  Go ahead.
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:11.000]  Sir, with your freedom, sir, with your freedom, were you trying to intimidate Ambassador
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:12.000]  Yabonovic?
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:13.000]  Ambassador Yabonovic.
[2:50:13.000 --> 2:50:16.000]  I just want to have a total, I want freedom of speech.
[2:50:16.000 --> 2:50:18.000]  That's a political process.
[2:50:18.000 --> 2:50:20.000]  The Republicans have been treated very badly.
[2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:22.000]  And I watched a little bit of it today.
[2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:26.000]  I wasn't able to yesterday because we had the President of Turkey here, and I wasn't
[2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:27.000]  able to watch much.
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:29.000]  I watched some of it this morning.
[2:50:29.000 --> 2:50:31.000]  I thought it was a disgrace.
[2:50:31.000 --> 2:50:36.000]  When we have great Republican representatives, people elected by the people, and they're not
[2:50:36.000 --> 2:50:37.000]  allowed to even ask a question.
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:39.000]  They're not allowed to make a statement.
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:41.000]  We're not allowed to have witnesses.
[2:50:41.000 --> 2:50:44.000]  We're not allowed to have legal counsel, White House counsel.
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:47.000]  It's a disgrace, and it's an embarrassment to our nation.
[2:50:47.000 --> 2:50:50.000]  Now, you just heard, and the questions go on.
[2:50:50.000 --> 2:50:53.000]  I was watching this during the break, so I had them back it up.
[2:50:53.000 --> 2:51:00.000]  Are you going to intimidate the ambassador that he fired years ago so she's mad at him?
[2:51:00.000 --> 2:51:02.000]  She had no evidence of anything?
[2:51:02.000 --> 2:51:05.000]  By you speaking and saying you're innocent?
[2:51:05.000 --> 2:51:11.000]  Sitting, Alex Jones said we're appointing Obama officials whose husband was on the Mueller probe.
[2:51:11.000 --> 2:51:14.000]  He had a grim reaper.
[2:51:14.000 --> 2:51:18.000]  Yeah, on another segment about Epstein dying.
[2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:22.000]  I mean, it's just can't ask questions.
[2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:24.000]  Only they can ask questions.
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:28.000]  And then if you say I'm innocent, it's like, oh my God, you're intimidating us.
[2:51:28.000 --> 2:51:29.000]  You heard Trump.
[2:51:29.000 --> 2:51:31.000]  He says, not in the history of our country.
[2:51:31.000 --> 2:51:38.000]  Yeah, not in the history of the country, as the president and the Justice Department put up with the censorship and the persecution of the American people.
[2:51:38.000 --> 2:51:42.000]  And Julian Assange, you told Mr. President to release the info.
[2:51:42.000 --> 2:51:46.000]  You did, and he did it.
[2:51:46.000 --> 2:51:52.000]  And he's literally dying in solitary confinement.
[2:51:52.000 --> 2:51:57.000]  He's been in court and came and taught them.
[2:51:57.000 --> 2:52:02.000]  Well, George Soros elects all the DA's around the country to indict everybody.
[2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:07.000]  And this demonic demon son is publicly post photos of him doing Alistair Crowley rituals.
[2:52:07.000 --> 2:52:09.000]  That's not even in WikiLeaks.
[2:52:09.000 --> 2:52:13.000]  Little bug-eyed devil worshipers would just get to piss on us and whatever they want.
[2:52:13.000 --> 2:52:14.000]  It's right around crazy.
[2:52:14.000 --> 2:52:22.000]  And Ed Buck and Schiff and their Alistair Crowley rituals, and it comes out and nobody even, it's just like, what?
[2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:27.000]  Big fat pedophiles, invading schools in Colorado and other areas.
[2:52:27.000 --> 2:52:31.000]  They don't even tell the parents when men come dressed as women in the class and the kids sit on their lap.
[2:52:31.000 --> 2:52:33.000]  They go, oh, horsey, horsey.
[2:52:33.000 --> 2:52:35.000]  I mean, that's what these people are doing.
[2:52:35.000 --> 2:52:38.000]  And they're getting you ready for a lot more.
[2:52:38.000 --> 2:52:41.000]  They're intimidating you to bow to them.
[2:52:41.000 --> 2:52:45.000]  And then it's weird when I get upset and say I want to fight back and say no to them.
[2:52:45.000 --> 2:52:52.000]  They go and go, judge, Alex Jones is threatening everyone. He's calling everyone to surround the White House and civil insurrection and all.
[2:52:52.000 --> 2:52:56.000]  I didn't know such thing. You're liars.
[2:52:56.000 --> 2:52:58.000]  Just like you said, Roger Stone was a criminal.
[2:52:58.000 --> 2:53:03.000]  He should be held in jail because he was directing me with the insurrection.
[2:53:03.000 --> 2:53:06.000]  All Roger said is only God can save me now.
[2:53:06.000 --> 2:53:07.000]  Only miracle.
[2:53:07.000 --> 2:53:08.000]  Ask for prayer.
[2:53:08.000 --> 2:53:09.000]  That's in political.
[2:53:09.000 --> 2:53:10.000]  He said that as well.
[2:53:10.000 --> 2:53:11.000]  But he can't say that.
[2:53:11.000 --> 2:53:12.000]  I'm innocent.
[2:53:12.000 --> 2:53:14.000]  I pray for God.
[2:53:14.000 --> 2:53:18.000]  No, no, you will not call on God either.
[2:53:18.000 --> 2:53:20.000]  Literally, you will not call on God.
[2:53:20.000 --> 2:53:22.000]  You will not call the people.
[2:53:22.000 --> 2:53:24.000]  You will not call the president.
[2:53:24.000 --> 2:53:34.000]  You will take it lying down because we went to Harvard and Yale and we've got law degrees and we are your master's America.
[2:53:34.000 --> 2:53:49.000]  And we're going to take everything you've got, your children, your property, your health, your guns, because we are chicken neck perverts.
[2:53:49.000 --> 2:54:01.000]  And that's what perverts do when they're in power.
[2:54:01.000 --> 2:54:06.000]  I've never seen anything like it in my life.
[2:54:06.000 --> 2:54:08.000]  People say, why are you pissed at Trump?
[2:54:08.000 --> 2:54:10.000]  Well, I mean, I know the Democrats are evil.
[2:54:10.000 --> 2:54:15.000]  I know they're trying to destroy everybody in the country and trying to bankrupt the nation, trying to sabotage the dollar.
[2:54:15.000 --> 2:54:16.000]  I mean, I know that.
[2:54:16.000 --> 2:54:23.000]  And then the president sits up there and tweets at these people and eloquently describes what crooks they are.
[2:54:23.000 --> 2:54:27.000]  Wonderful.
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:33.000]  So does Trump secretly work with the deep state and then he just holds our hand like he holds somebody's hand at hospice?
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:42.000]  I'm not saying that, but you know, you could start saying that because if Hillary was into and all this, nobody put up with it.
[2:54:42.000 --> 2:54:48.000]  But you see of Trump's in there and all this persecution and censorship and control goes into place.
[2:54:48.000 --> 2:55:04.000]  And then he always, you know, acts like he's fighting it, but never really does anything about it to stop it.
[2:55:04.000 --> 2:55:13.000]  I don't know. It's just food for thought because Roger Stone did nothing wrong except get the president elected.
[2:55:13.000 --> 2:55:18.000]  And maybe Trump's doing the right thing and pardon him right away. That's good.
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:20.000]  But you don't wait a year until the election.
[2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:24.000]  Roger Stone will be dead just as sure as the sun came up this morning.
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:28.000]  And yeah, I've got a lot of energy. I'm fire breathing right now.
[2:55:28.000 --> 2:55:31.000]  And I'm a little radioactive, love the critter and a wonderful job.
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:33.000]  I've seen piston here. It's not them.
[2:55:33.000 --> 2:55:41.000]  I just am faced with absolute pure evil and I know it's evil and it admits it's evil and it's parading back and forth around in front of me.
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:50.000]  The average man I see in Austin is getting out of their pickup truck or out of their Porsche with their golf bags and they're all into themselves and their perfect sunglasses and all the rest of it.
[2:55:50.000 --> 2:55:56.000]  And they're losing their country and everything, but they don't see it as their political.
[2:55:56.000 --> 2:55:59.000]  They just go work the corporate job and keep their head down.
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:06.000]  And that's how they get ahead when they're living off people that fought for the platform that allowed all this to be developed.
[2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:16.000]  And I'll tell you, that's who I'm really pissed at that the men of America would let the government and a whole bunch of states keep babies alive after they're born to take their organs.
[2:56:16.000 --> 2:56:19.000]  Like men feel safe. They think their kids are safe.
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:27.000]  And that the so-called churches are nothing but smiley face social clubs.
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:37.000]  Where Joel Oldstein can travel like a kindle up there and prance around with name and claimant stuff. And I'm not even trying to attack him.
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:49.000]  It's just imagine if those churches did something about the devil worship and the open borders and the global government and the new world order and the mark of the beast and the cashless society and just all of it's happening, happening, happening, happening, happening, happening.
[2:56:49.000 --> 2:56:57.000]  And you go to these churches, you don't hear a damn word. Man, 30, 40 years ago in churches, I heard about everything. It all came true. Those were real churches.
[2:56:57.000 --> 2:57:14.000]  They had vision. They had discernment. They knew it was coming. They had the Holy Ghost. You don't hear any of that in these churches and you don't feel the spirit of God in them either, do you?
[2:57:14.000 --> 2:57:18.000]  Well, let me tell everybody all the cowards out there. I don't mean our audience, but the cowards.
[2:57:18.000 --> 2:57:28.000]  You think you're going to sit on the sidelines? All this evil goes on. You're going to get drug into the game by the new world order.
[2:57:28.000 --> 2:57:39.000]  And it's going to be more horrible than you could ever imagine because you were lazy and stupid and cowardly and everything you've got is going to be taken.
[2:57:39.000 --> 2:57:45.000]  And you're going to beg for mercy and no mercy is going to come.
[2:57:45.000 --> 2:57:55.000]  About a month ago, President Trump announced that he was going to move his domicile from New York City to Florida, where he's always said he planned to retire to.
[2:57:55.000 --> 2:58:06.000]  And the left got so excited. They said, oh, he's about to resign and leave instead of facing impeachment and he's running to Florida.
[2:58:06.000 --> 2:58:18.000]  Well, now we know why the president did that. He knew the leftist-controlled appeals courts were going to say that he had to give up his tax returns so they can pour over them and harass every business partner he's got.
[2:58:18.000 --> 2:58:22.000]  They want to terrorize people that he's worked with.
[2:58:22.000 --> 2:58:32.000]  And by moving his domicile from New York to Florida, that gets around the New York law they passed to get his tax returns that are supposed to be private.
[2:58:32.000 --> 2:58:46.000]  So all those people out there holding their breath for the president to resign, in his words, we're kicking the deep states ass and he's never going to resign.
[2:58:46.000 --> 2:58:57.000]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson. What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to?
[2:58:57.000 --> 2:59:06.000]  How far will they go? What's their limit? And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit.
[2:59:06.000 --> 2:59:12.000]  The answer is there is no limit to evil. It is a bottomless pit.
[2:59:12.000 --> 2:59:31.000]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist or that there's no free will, there's no devil or the God. But those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like.
[2:59:31.000 --> 2:59:45.000]  They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us. Oxford's banned clapping. Universities in the US have banned 21 gun salutes for veterans. These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them.
[3:00:01.000 --> 3:00:19.000]  All right. Tyler Nixon confidant of Roger Stone, also formerly his lawyer, but not in this case, is we with Roger and they're talking and he'll be with us. He should be with us next segment.
[3:00:19.000 --> 3:00:34.000]  You can hear your phone calls right now. I really love Trump and I like the fact he's there instead of Hillary and I'm going to take a few calls now but I'm going to briefly at the start of the next segment have a message for President Trump because I know what Trump's doing.
[3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:45.000]  I know what he's being told and I know the calculus that's going on in his brain about Roger Stone and this is a lot bigger than Roger Stone obviously and that calculus is not good.
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:53.000]  Roger Stone is not a fart in church that we just try to pretend didn't happen.
[3:00:53.000 --> 3:01:01.000]  Trump needs to run towards this and pardon Stone and point out how it's all fiasco just like the fake impeachment.
[3:01:01.000 --> 3:01:24.000]  We had a press conference and we went and checked reportedly he didn't talk about Stone and just like he didn't talk about Julian Assange anymore after he told Julian Assange to release the info and that's a lack of loyalty
[3:01:24.000 --> 3:01:36.000]  and it's not good you know we've been right about everything we told Trump all the moles everything and you know instead he just brings in all those candy asses
[3:01:36.000 --> 3:01:44.000]  because everybody's trying to play it safe well playing it safe got us where we are not playing it safe got Trump elected
[3:01:44.000 --> 3:01:59.000]  and he's the key player that's got the political power and right to stop all this and leaving us twisting out in the wind is not good I'm gonna stop right there.
[3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:04.000]  Who should we go to first year.
[3:02:04.000 --> 3:02:08.000]  Let's talk to Chris in Tennessee go ahead Chris you're on the air.
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:10.000]  How's it going Alex.
[3:02:10.000 --> 3:02:13.000]  Man I am fired up and just in war mode.
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:15.000]  I hear you.
[3:02:15.000 --> 3:02:23.000]  I'm a I'm a little saddened about what's going on I'm thinking at a certain point when do we admit that Trump isn't a white hat.
[3:02:23.000 --> 3:02:28.000]  I mean he still hadn't pardoned Assange the indictments haven't come.
[3:02:28.000 --> 3:02:41.000]  And what you said you hit the nail on the head earlier I think like would it be smarter for the globalist to just have Hillary in or would it be smarter for them to have Trump in and just act like he's on our side.
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:54.000]  Well I don't think that we haven't started introducing an idea because it because I mean I think he's just surrounded by the swamp he listens to advisors oh don't don't say much about Roger because you know he's been convicted that ties you to stuff during the impeachment
[3:02:54.000 --> 3:03:05.000]  Oh give me a break the whole thing is a fraud everybody knows it call it and all their attempts to say don't talk about whistleblower names don't talk about jurors all of that is just pure mafia tactics.
[3:03:05.000 --> 3:03:11.000]  He was just talking about the press conference to talk about Roger and it's just a sign of what's going on.
[3:03:11.000 --> 3:03:20.000]  He's done a lot of stuff like saying America's good and it's good to have borders that the globalists don't like I mean they I mean Trump has good instincts in many ways and I don't think it's a bad guy.
[3:03:20.000 --> 3:03:24.000]  But you heard Pachennik and they've done an assessment him Pachennik smart.
[3:03:24.000 --> 3:03:34.000]  Trump is not a wimp but he's he's not as you know tough as he says he is when it comes to easily manipulated it seems like maybe.
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:39.000]  I mean he has done Trump's done great stuff like pull us out of the TPP.
[3:03:39.000 --> 3:03:42.000]  Trying to end these wars yeah I mean yeah.
[3:03:42.000 --> 3:03:49.000]  Yeah but it comes to it comes to a certain point where it's like you say he hasn't he hasn't stopped the censorship.
[3:03:49.000 --> 3:03:53.000]  He hasn't I mean he still hadn't pardoned the Sange even though.
[3:03:53.000 --> 3:03:58.000]  Look look Giuliani stood up for him and went after the deep state and they're trying to indict him.
[3:03:58.000 --> 3:04:02.000]  I guess he'll just note I'm not just cutting Giuliani loose give me a break.
[3:04:02.000 --> 3:04:05.000]  Well don't you think Giuliani is a kind of shady.
[3:04:05.000 --> 3:04:08.000]  He was probably involved in covering up 9-11 when he was mayor.
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:13.000]  Oh there's no doubt that he knew about bigger stuff and went along with that.
[3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:17.000]  I'm talking about the season we're in now and yeah but Giuliani I don't is a smart guy.
[3:04:17.000 --> 3:04:18.000]  He's corrupt.
[3:04:18.000 --> 3:04:22.000]  I don't think he's not to get America and I think that's the issue and they sold to them.
[3:04:22.000 --> 3:04:26.000]  OK we let this happen on 9-11 to get organized and stop the Islamic invasion.
[3:04:26.000 --> 3:04:29.000]  It really wasn't that really wasn't why they let that happen.
[3:04:29.000 --> 3:04:32.000]  But you're absolutely right. God bless you Chris.
[3:04:32.000 --> 3:04:35.000]  What a craze mode right now.
[3:04:35.000 --> 3:04:43.000]  We're going to talk to a bunch of other callers Tom and Johnny and Kale and Jeff and Jeff and Steve and Danny and Tyler and Wilde.
[3:04:43.000 --> 3:04:45.000]  We want all your calls and Tyler Nixon.
[3:04:45.000 --> 3:04:47.000]  Roger Stone's confidant who's with him right now.
[3:04:47.000 --> 3:04:49.000]  He's going to be joining us on the other side.
[3:04:49.000 --> 3:04:53.000]  If Roger talks to us he goes to prison.
[3:04:53.000 --> 3:04:59.000]  M4 Wars Life has done it again with undoubtedly our biggest breakthrough yet.
[3:04:59.000 --> 3:05:03.000]  Super silver whitening toothpaste.
[3:05:03.000 --> 3:05:04.000]  This is proprietary.
[3:05:04.000 --> 3:05:09.000]  This is with the top lab in the country and it is incredibly high quality.
[3:05:09.000 --> 3:05:12.000]  This is the best toothpaste you're going to find.
[3:05:12.000 --> 3:05:16.000]  It's called whitening toothpaste but really it knocks out the bacteria.
[3:05:16.000 --> 3:05:17.000]  It recalcifies the teeth.
[3:05:17.000 --> 3:05:20.000]  It does so many things on so many fronts.
[3:05:20.000 --> 3:05:28.000]  These beautiful tubes of super silver toothpaste are available at an introductory price of 25% off out of the gates.
[3:05:28.000 --> 3:05:32.000]  It's as low as we can go and they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[3:05:32.000 --> 3:05:35.000]  Super silver whitening toothpaste is going to be a hit.
[3:05:35.000 --> 3:05:37.000]  I'm very, very proud of it.
[3:05:37.000 --> 3:05:43.000]  I want to thank my father, a retired dentist for spearheading this the last two years and developing it.
[3:05:43.000 --> 3:05:45.000]  It's 25% off out of the gates.
[3:05:45.000 --> 3:05:52.000]  It's as low as we can go because it's very, very expensive to produce. Get yours today at infowarslife.com.
[3:06:15.000 --> 3:06:18.000]  This is that web show and website led by Rachel Hall at College Jones.
[3:06:18.000 --> 3:06:21.000]  I want them shut down. I want them silenced. I want them muted.
[3:06:21.000 --> 3:06:23.000]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[3:06:23.000 --> 3:06:25.000]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[3:06:25.000 --> 3:06:31.000]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[3:06:31.000 --> 3:06:35.000]  These are very extreme individuals and no matter what anyone tells you, they are extremists
[3:06:35.000 --> 3:06:38.000]  and that's why Facebook decided to get rid of them.
[3:06:38.000 --> 3:06:42.000]  Basically they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous is what Facebook is saying.
[3:06:42.000 --> 3:06:46.000]  These individuals include people like right wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[3:06:46.000 --> 3:06:53.000]  Organizations like Media Matters have pointed out consistently how Alex Jones and other info wars pages
[3:06:53.000 --> 3:06:59.000]  had just simply circumvented any ban by starting a different account or going on Instagram.
[3:06:59.000 --> 3:07:03.000]  If you don't like someone on Facebook, don't follow them. It's not that hard to figure out.
[3:07:03.000 --> 3:07:07.000]  Facebook, are you going to do something about the liberals who call me the n-word?
[3:07:07.000 --> 3:07:11.000]  No, because big tech is only interested in going after conservatives.
[3:07:11.000 --> 3:07:13.000]  You know, the really dangerous ones.
[3:07:13.000 --> 3:07:16.000]  Dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like.
[3:07:16.000 --> 3:07:21.000]  President Trump retweeted Paul Joseph Watson twice and a brief video by Infowars Millie Weaver.
[3:07:21.000 --> 3:07:25.000]  Social media's hall monitor Frank Stelter was not very happy about it.
[3:07:25.000 --> 3:07:28.000]  He is promoting the same alternative universe as Infowars.
[3:07:28.000 --> 3:07:31.000]  Back to your point though about the Infowars presidency.
[3:07:31.000 --> 3:07:38.000]  I want to know and I tweeted this the other day, what is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and Infowars.com?
[3:07:38.000 --> 3:07:43.000]  Infowars content is useful to him. Infowars personalities align with them.
[3:07:43.000 --> 3:07:48.000]  I want them shut down. I want them silenced. I want them muted. I think they are horrible for our society.
[3:07:48.000 --> 3:07:52.000]  I want them shut down. I want them silenced. I want them muted.
[3:07:52.000 --> 3:08:09.000]  Don't worry. These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[3:08:09.000 --> 3:08:25.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, let me explain something to the deep state and to the establishment.
[3:08:25.000 --> 3:08:30.000]  The deep state gets so scared of deep fakes where you can take video and fake it.
[3:08:30.000 --> 3:08:32.000]  I mean, hell, Hollywood's been doing that for decades.
[3:08:32.000 --> 3:08:39.000]  And running man written by Stephen King turned into a movie.
[3:08:39.000 --> 3:08:46.000]  The government can show one person that really killed somebody but then put somebody else's face on it with computers that's set in the future.
[3:08:46.000 --> 3:08:49.000]  I think it's even set in like 2020 or something.
[3:08:49.000 --> 3:08:53.000]  But that's how crazy all this is.
[3:08:53.000 --> 3:09:01.000]  This morning I'm working out and my workout partner goes, look at this funny video that your son Rex tweeted.
[3:09:01.000 --> 3:09:07.000]  And as soon as I saw the video, I called Rex up this morning, he's 17, about to finish high school.
[3:09:07.000 --> 3:09:12.000]  And I said, you said that I sent you this video.
[3:09:12.000 --> 3:09:14.000]  And he said, oh, I just did that as a joke.
[3:09:14.000 --> 3:09:17.000]  And I said, well, okay, somebody's taking a blue screen of me.
[3:09:17.000 --> 3:09:21.000]  That's footage that I shot a while back to send to Carpe Donkton.
[3:09:21.000 --> 3:09:24.000]  I've talked about this on air so he can make some memes.
[3:09:24.000 --> 3:09:30.000]  We did a lot of the funny things I've done on air over the years so he could put my head and body on different things.
[3:09:30.000 --> 3:09:39.000]  And then I guess somebody in the process has sent out this green screen video trying to track down.
[3:09:39.000 --> 3:09:47.000]  Now I'm told I'll be in court over this for corrupting minors.
[3:09:47.000 --> 3:09:52.000]  Now remember ABC News showed a guy that was a little bit like me when a kid hit him, pushed the kid down.
[3:09:52.000 --> 3:09:53.000]  They took me off YouTube.
[3:09:53.000 --> 3:09:55.000]  One of the reasons was beating up a child.
[3:09:55.000 --> 3:09:58.000]  It was all of her Forbes, AP, Jones beats up a child.
[3:09:58.000 --> 3:10:00.000]  Was it me? Never did it.
[3:10:00.000 --> 3:10:03.000]  Was all over ABC News? Not me.
[3:10:03.000 --> 3:10:09.000]  But see, and my son this morning, he thought I was going to be in a jerky.
[3:10:09.000 --> 3:10:11.000]  He goes, come on, Dad, I'm 17.
[3:10:11.000 --> 3:10:12.000]  It's a joke.
[3:10:12.000 --> 3:10:13.000]  Somebody sent it to me.
[3:10:13.000 --> 3:10:16.000]  Everybody loves it.
[3:10:16.000 --> 3:10:22.000]  And it's just some, I guess, looks like from the 90s rap video or something.
[3:10:22.000 --> 3:10:27.000]  And I literally, the courts and people, I'm going to do affidavits and stuff now this afternoon,
[3:10:27.000 --> 3:10:31.000]  don't understand green screen.
[3:10:31.000 --> 3:10:32.000]  And it's the same thing.
[3:10:32.000 --> 3:10:36.000]  Imagine at the higher levels, these courts, when federal prosecutors come in and tell them,
[3:10:36.000 --> 3:10:40.000]  Jones is threatening to overthrow the government and armies are going to attack DC.
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:42.000]  And you've got to arrest him and Roger Stone and put him in jail.
[3:10:42.000 --> 3:10:44.000]  They want insurrection.
[3:10:44.000 --> 3:10:48.000]  And these judges are like, they did that on the internet sees.
[3:10:48.000 --> 3:10:52.000]  And I've literally been in court before with judges that are pretty smart.
[3:10:52.000 --> 3:10:55.000]  You know, I mean, you know, it's not savvy about internet going.
[3:10:55.000 --> 3:10:57.000]  I've been on the stand.
[3:10:57.000 --> 3:10:59.000]  They've gone, what's a meme and what's a gay frog?
[3:10:59.000 --> 3:11:04.000]  I had in a family court thing a couple of years ago and I'm like, a meme is just something funny.
[3:11:04.000 --> 3:11:10.000]  It's, you could have like a newspaper, you know, picture a newspaper and draw a mustache on somebody.
[3:11:10.000 --> 3:11:11.000]  And it's funny.
[3:11:11.000 --> 3:11:12.000]  It's a meme.
[3:11:12.000 --> 3:11:16.000]  It's just you take something and then you put something on it and it's like cave drawings.
[3:11:16.000 --> 3:11:19.000]  And it's in the news, Jones babbles about cave drawings.
[3:11:19.000 --> 3:11:24.000]  I mean, it's like, it's insane, ladies and gentlemen, but that's the level of scrutiny.
[3:11:24.000 --> 3:11:26.000]  We have a grim reaper on here to ask it.
[3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:31.000]  What happened to Epstein is a joke that turns into threatening jurors has nothing to do with this shirt with the Roger Stone.
[3:11:31.000 --> 3:11:38.000]  I get asked by Carpe Donkta, but he didn't even put out this video to shoot some green screen.
[3:11:38.000 --> 3:11:40.000]  And I have talked about dumping out raw green screens.
[3:11:40.000 --> 3:11:41.000]  People can use it.
[3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:42.000]  I guess that's what's happened.
[3:11:42.000 --> 3:11:43.000]  I'm trying to find out right now.
[3:11:43.000 --> 3:11:45.000]  And then somebody puts this to it.
[3:11:45.000 --> 3:11:53.000]  And then people think I'm dancing with women shaking their butts and that I really did this with my son.
[3:11:53.000 --> 3:11:57.000]  So I'm getting questions like, did your son shoot the video?
[3:11:57.000 --> 3:12:01.000]  And I'll be in court sitting there going, no, I did not shoot the video.
[3:12:01.000 --> 3:12:02.000]  No.
[3:12:02.000 --> 3:12:05.000]  And I'm like, well, how are the women behind you?
[3:12:05.000 --> 3:12:09.000]  How does a weatherman walk up there and there's a map of the United States?
[3:12:09.000 --> 3:12:12.000]  It's a freaking projection.
[3:12:12.000 --> 3:12:14.000]  I mean, I didn't used to think I was smart.
[3:12:14.000 --> 3:12:15.000]  I know what it is.
[3:12:15.000 --> 3:12:19.000]  I'm just a moron and the rest of the public.
[3:12:19.000 --> 3:12:27.000]  Like have lobotomies or something, but that's where all of this goes in this country.
[3:12:27.000 --> 3:12:30.000]  So the establishment doesn't even know what's going on.
[3:12:30.000 --> 3:12:31.000]  They have no idea.
[3:12:31.000 --> 3:12:35.000]  They're talking about singularities and all this power and all this control and how they're going to do this and that.
[3:12:35.000 --> 3:12:40.000]  And they have no, they don't even know anything.
[3:12:40.000 --> 3:12:41.000]  They're in the break.
[3:12:41.000 --> 3:12:48.000]  I'm explaining how I'm going to have to explain in court.
[3:12:48.000 --> 3:12:51.000]  And I said, what if I was in the street with a bunch of women shaking their butts?
[3:12:51.000 --> 3:12:54.000]  They're not naked.
[3:12:54.000 --> 3:13:00.000]  Well, it's just not good for kids to have, you know, to be out with their dad with the women.
[3:13:00.000 --> 3:13:04.000]  It's like some 1990s video someone put behind me and they won't understand it.
[3:13:04.000 --> 3:13:05.000]  No one does.
[3:13:05.000 --> 3:13:07.000]  Civilization is over, man.
[3:13:07.000 --> 3:13:08.000]  I don't even know what to do anymore.
[3:13:08.000 --> 3:13:17.000]  They're on the news saying it's illegal to say who the damn whistleblower is when it's not.
[3:13:17.000 --> 3:13:19.000]  And then it's like, don't talk about it.
[3:13:19.000 --> 3:13:23.000]  You might piss the system off when you talk about how dumb they are.
[3:13:23.000 --> 3:13:25.000]  And the system's not done.
[3:13:25.000 --> 3:13:28.000]  They're just busy and ignorant and focused on their own little speciality.
[3:13:28.000 --> 3:13:31.000]  But the public is, I don't know what planet they're on.
[3:13:31.000 --> 3:13:35.000]  So here is the footage that I wasn't going to play or they showed me this morning.
[3:13:35.000 --> 3:13:42.000]  But I assure you, I was not out in the streets of the 1990s with women behind me shaking their butts.
[3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:49.000]  Carpe Dawgson wanted me to do some of the funny things I've said over the years and I have sung to this song before, I think, once.
[3:13:49.000 --> 3:13:51.000]  And that's it.
[3:13:51.000 --> 3:13:52.000]  So they put me over it.
[3:13:52.000 --> 3:13:53.000]  It's my crime.
[3:13:53.000 --> 3:13:54.000]  I'll probably go to federal prison for it.
[3:13:54.000 --> 3:13:55.000]  Here it is.
[3:13:55.000 --> 3:13:58.000]  Booty, booty, booty, booty, booty, booty everywhere.
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:13:59.000]  Rocket everywhere.
[3:13:59.000 --> 3:14:00.000]  Rocket everywhere.
[3:14:00.000 --> 3:14:03.000]  I don't miss being a booty.
[3:14:03.000 --> 3:14:08.000]  I don't even ride TV at the players club for a month or two.
[3:14:08.000 --> 3:14:10.000]  I forget all those songs.
[3:14:10.000 --> 3:14:12.000]  Oh, yeah.
[3:14:12.000 --> 3:14:15.000]  And they go next, do move, bitch.
[3:14:15.000 --> 3:14:16.000]  Move, bitch.
[3:14:16.000 --> 3:14:17.000]  Get out the way.
[3:14:17.000 --> 3:14:18.000]  Get out the way, bitch.
[3:14:18.000 --> 3:14:19.000]  Move out the way.
[3:14:19.000 --> 3:14:21.000]  Next, they'll have video behind me.
[3:14:21.000 --> 3:14:24.000]  Oh, I mean, oh my God, I apologize to the callers.
[3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:26.000]  We're still waiting on Tyler next thing to get on.
[3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:27.000]  I'll go to your calls.
[3:14:27.000 --> 3:14:28.000]  I swear I'm going to shut up when we come back.
[3:14:28.000 --> 3:14:29.000]  I'm not even complaining.
[3:14:29.000 --> 3:14:32.000]  I just don't know what to do at this point.
[3:14:32.000 --> 3:14:36.000]  I don't know what to do at this point.
[3:14:36.000 --> 3:14:40.000]  I mean, you can have the lawyer for the whistleblower saying,
[3:14:40.000 --> 3:14:42.000]  I like to represent pedophiles and the national security
[3:14:42.000 --> 3:14:46.000]  clearances and saying, I like to go to Disney World and water
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:48.000]  parks by myself and takes pictures with little kids behind
[3:14:48.000 --> 3:14:49.000]  him.
[3:14:49.000 --> 3:14:53.000]  And he goes, I admire little girls on his YouTube page and
[3:14:53.000 --> 3:14:56.000]  says he likes Jeffrey Epstein after he's arrested and says
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:14:58.000]  he'd love to be associated with him.
[3:14:58.000 --> 3:15:00.000]  He says, I want to be associated with Jeffrey Epstein.
[3:15:00.000 --> 3:15:04.000]  I don't think it's a problem.
[3:15:04.000 --> 3:15:06.000]  And but oh, he's a good guy though.
[3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:14.000]  Oh, but the internet has green screen of me.
[3:15:14.000 --> 3:15:24.000]  Oh.
[3:15:24.000 --> 3:15:27.000]  I was in court once they were asking what tick tock is.
[3:15:27.000 --> 3:15:32.000]  I'm just like, you know, like was your child really in Spain
[3:15:32.000 --> 3:15:34.000]  flying in a helicopter?
[3:15:34.000 --> 3:15:36.000]  I'm like, no, it puts clips together.
[3:15:36.000 --> 3:15:37.000]  You will swear on the road.
[3:15:37.000 --> 3:15:40.000]  They're not in helicopters in Spain.
[3:15:40.000 --> 3:15:42.000]  I'm like, no, they're not in helicopters in Spain.
[3:15:42.000 --> 3:15:43.000]  It's a clip.
[3:15:43.000 --> 3:15:44.000]  It's tick tock.
[3:15:44.000 --> 3:15:45.000]  It moves clips together.
[3:15:45.000 --> 3:15:46.000]  I just, you can't help them.
[3:15:46.000 --> 3:15:47.000]  It's all over.

[3:33:46.000 --> 3:33:51.120]  want darkness. They want to shut down our speech. They can do whatever they want to us whenever they
[3:33:51.120 --> 3:33:57.200]  want, however they want. Tyler Nixon, longtime Roger Stone, confidante and friend. He's also
[3:33:57.200 --> 3:34:02.000]  been his personal lawyer, but he's not representing him in this criminal case where he's now been
[3:34:02.000 --> 3:34:07.520]  indicted on all counts, facing 50 years in prison for a thought crime, getting Donald
[3:34:07.520 --> 3:34:14.240]  John Trump elected. I talked to reporters that were in the room today and they said that it was
[3:34:14.240 --> 3:34:19.680]  just spectacular what was going on, claiming that Roger and I were planning some insurrection
[3:34:19.680 --> 3:34:23.680]  and violence and he had to be put in jail and all the rest of it. Tyler Nixon cannot confirm
[3:34:23.680 --> 3:34:30.160]  to deny that. He won't talk to me about that on the phone. He said, whatever I say is going to
[3:34:30.160 --> 3:34:34.880]  be on air and that's it. So that's how much tyranny we're witnessing and that's my view,
[3:34:34.880 --> 3:34:39.360]  not his. We have to preface all of this. So, Tyler Nixon, I know you've been with Roger
[3:34:39.360 --> 3:34:42.640]  basically all day. I don't know what you're going to tell us. I don't know what you can say
[3:34:42.640 --> 3:34:50.400]  because, you know, they'll punish Roger for our speech. I'm told by reporters that he's not even
[3:34:50.400 --> 3:34:54.080]  supposed to say pardon me. He's just supposed to, I guess, just put his head in the news,
[3:34:54.080 --> 3:34:59.440]  but Tyler Nixon joins us via audio Skype and thank you for coming on with us, Tyler.
[3:35:00.640 --> 3:35:05.280]  Well, it's always good to be with you, Alex. I wish we were together under better circumstances.
[3:35:05.280 --> 3:35:14.560]  Yeah, this whole thing has been such an incredible, astounding abuse of power
[3:35:15.520 --> 3:35:19.760]  on the order of tyranny, the likes of which I don't think this country has ever seen, frankly.
[3:35:19.760 --> 3:35:23.680]  I mean, the criminalization of politics, the criminalization of political activity,
[3:35:24.480 --> 3:35:29.520]  opposition research, where investigating your opponents becomes obstruction of justice,
[3:35:29.520 --> 3:35:37.040]  where, you know, a man who's a private citizen who was grilled by partisan adversaries, enemies,
[3:35:37.040 --> 3:35:44.720]  really, in a closed or secret committee hearing is then charged with crimes over their gotcha
[3:35:44.720 --> 3:35:50.160]  questions, you know, a handful out of nearly 600 questions posed. The same people who had
[3:35:51.680 --> 3:35:55.840]  excuse me, who had up to six months before that essentially accused the same witness,
[3:35:55.840 --> 3:36:00.800]  Roger Stone, of treason involving, you know, WikiLeaks and whatever the, you know, whatever
[3:36:00.800 --> 3:36:04.960]  they were cooking up at the time. And these are treated as though they're disinterested
[3:36:04.960 --> 3:36:10.560]  investigators, as though they're impartial, objective truth seekers, you know, Adam Schiff,
[3:36:10.560 --> 3:36:18.800]  Eric Swalwell. And then on top of that, you have this loose leftist militant witness, quote, unquote,
[3:36:18.800 --> 3:36:26.080]  Krediko, who is just a disgraceful liar as far as I'm concerned. He is a liar. He's had multiple
[3:36:26.080 --> 3:36:31.520]  different stories that he's told. His whole version of events evolved, whereas Roger's told
[3:36:31.520 --> 3:36:36.560]  the same thing from the beginning. He basically gaslit Roger, giving Roger the impression that
[3:36:36.560 --> 3:36:41.600]  this guy, Krediko, had some connection or some sort of inside information, none of which Roger
[3:36:41.600 --> 3:36:46.160]  ever received anyway. He never had any kind of inside information. Even Julian Assange himself
[3:36:46.160 --> 3:36:51.360]  came out and said, Roger Stone has only said repeated or, you know, confirmed or went on the
[3:36:51.360 --> 3:36:56.880]  air and talked about what we had publicly released already. So there's no underlying crime involved,
[3:36:56.880 --> 3:37:01.200]  even if they were speaking, it wouldn't have been a crime. Yet Roger Stone is caught and
[3:37:01.200 --> 3:37:07.280]  snared in this, you know, what it is, is some malicious prosecution by partisans who are intent
[3:37:07.280 --> 3:37:12.560]  on taking the head of the highest trophy, so to speak, trophy target that they can,
[3:37:12.560 --> 3:37:19.120]  and that it is connected to President Trump. And it's a disgusting miscarriage of justice. And
[3:37:19.120 --> 3:37:24.000]  I would like to say again, I speak for myself only. Roger Stone does not even know that I'm
[3:37:24.000 --> 3:37:29.600]  appearing on this. You know, whatever the case, I don't speak for him in any way. This is my own
[3:37:29.600 --> 3:37:33.920]  opinions. You know, having been an observer there, I'm not on his defense team. I, you know,
[3:37:33.920 --> 3:37:37.360]  I've advised him, I've written with him. And we've already added those provisos. I mean,
[3:37:37.360 --> 3:37:42.240]  look at how this guy is paralyzed under Soviet style tyranny. It's a giant political trial.
[3:37:42.240 --> 3:37:45.840]  Roger wasn't supposed to point out that there was never Russian collusion. They said it wasn't
[3:37:45.840 --> 3:37:50.320]  about Trump, the judge said, then the whole prosecution was about Trump and playing clips
[3:37:50.320 --> 3:37:56.240]  reportedly of me every day out of context. And then I heard all from reporters that they were
[3:37:56.240 --> 3:38:01.360]  saying that we were planning an insurrection and violence. And so he had to be put in jail and
[3:38:01.360 --> 3:38:05.360]  and that the gag continues when that's unconstitutional. And you won't even respond to
[3:38:05.360 --> 3:38:09.280]  that. When I've talked to you off air, you won't tell me how Roger is. I mean, I guess just,
[3:38:09.280 --> 3:38:14.080]  I mean, this is in America. These gag orders have all been found unconstitutional in the past,
[3:38:14.080 --> 3:38:17.840]  haven't they? But oh, that's a gag order on the case. So Tyler Nixon probably can't talk about
[3:38:17.840 --> 3:38:25.040]  that. Can you talk about the weather, Tyler Nixon? Well, it's damp and dank here in Washington,
[3:38:25.040 --> 3:38:31.360]  as always, even when it's a sunny day. You know, this place, this place is a cesspool of corruption.
[3:38:31.360 --> 3:38:37.200]  I mean, think of the think of the Kafkaesque insanity of, you know, where they call exposing
[3:38:37.200 --> 3:38:42.800]  their corruption, digging up dirt, you know, it's like the emails, for example, that WikiLeaks
[3:38:42.800 --> 3:38:47.920]  released, how would they be dirt if they weren't dirt? These own people's communications showing
[3:38:47.920 --> 3:38:53.760]  what corrupt manipulative ruthless megalomaniacs they are. And it's treated as though, oh, we're
[3:38:53.760 --> 3:38:58.960]  trying to manufacture, you know, they accuse us of what they're constantly doing. They've seized
[3:38:58.960 --> 3:39:02.960]  control of sections of our government, law enforcement, the most important, the president
[3:39:02.960 --> 3:39:08.560]  himself immediately trumped out, not necessarily direct support for Roger, but he said, you know,
[3:39:08.560 --> 3:39:13.120]  stone, you're a private citizen and a consultant and, you know, admittedly a
[3:39:13.120 --> 3:39:17.440]  hardball politico, someone who doesn't run around wrapped in sanctimony and phony
[3:39:18.080 --> 3:39:22.000]  self-righteousness like our, you know, his opponents do, which is why they hate him because he
[3:39:22.000 --> 3:39:26.960]  really just, you know, is honest about who he is and what he does. And frankly, about who they are
[3:39:26.960 --> 3:39:30.880]  and what they do. But they're the ones wrapped in sanctimony. He's the one going down while
[3:39:30.880 --> 3:39:37.760]  McCabe stroke or down the line, all these liars and fabricators, Brennan clapper, Brennan lied
[3:39:37.760 --> 3:39:42.560]  on public television and open hearing before Congress about tapping wiretapping.
[3:39:42.560 --> 3:39:47.360]  He said the NSA has never listened to one American. It's like saying Santa Claus doesn't
[3:39:47.360 --> 3:39:52.960]  wear a red and white suit. Now, let's expand on this though of what you're able to get into
[3:39:52.960 --> 3:39:59.280]  is Roger Stone's friend. Can we talk about how's Roger doing? Or is that okay with Judge Jackson?
[3:39:59.280 --> 3:40:05.360]  Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know what? I'm an American citizen. I'm a patriot. I'm a veteran who served
[3:40:05.360 --> 3:40:13.440]  in combat service. And, you know, no potentate, you know, self-appointed authoritarian, whatever
[3:40:13.440 --> 3:40:17.920]  have you leftist Obama appointee is going to tell me that I can't speak out about what I choose to
[3:40:17.920 --> 3:40:22.880]  speak out about. And, you know, the bottom line is that Roger is a fighter and you'd be surprised.
[3:40:22.880 --> 3:40:29.600]  I mean, he's resilient. I've never seen someone so calm and, you know, cool and collected and
[3:40:29.600 --> 3:40:34.320]  resolute in his case because he knows he's innocent, you know, and it's, you know,
[3:40:34.320 --> 3:40:39.120]  one would think you'd be outraged, you'd be broken down. But, you know, Roger is a fighter,
[3:40:39.120 --> 3:40:43.680]  a survivor. He's endured a lot in his life. I mean, this is a horrible thing to go through
[3:40:43.680 --> 3:40:48.960]  for he and Nydia, especially, you know, I mean, Roger's a family man. You know, he may be a bare
[3:40:48.960 --> 3:40:53.440]  knuckle brawler when it comes to the political realm, but, you know, behind the scenes, he's a
[3:40:53.440 --> 3:40:57.840]  good, a good guy, you know, he's so. He is tough. He is tough. I've kind of described it as, you
[3:40:57.840 --> 3:41:00.800]  know, scared of the judge and all this, but what else he's supposed to do, caught in the jaws of
[3:41:00.800 --> 3:41:06.160]  this thing? We shall be praying for Roger. And I'm told by callers when you call the White House now,
[3:41:06.160 --> 3:41:09.680]  they just don't even let you leave a message and say, why are you wasting your time for Roger?
[3:41:09.680 --> 3:41:13.600]  That's the type of people they have answered the phone. Trump's just surrounded by trash.
[3:41:13.600 --> 3:41:18.880]  Sure, some of the folks answered the phones are good. Here's an alternate number, 202-456-1111,
[3:41:18.880 --> 3:41:29.360]  202-456-1414. Trump needs to pardon him, doesn't he? I mean, I guess if there's a gag on the case,
[3:41:29.360 --> 3:41:34.000]  are we even supposed to say that sentencing is February 6th? I guess you can't talk about that.
[3:41:35.600 --> 3:41:41.280]  Well, first of all, StoneDefenseFund.com, because now, unfortunately, we've got to get into the
[3:41:41.280 --> 3:41:47.840]  appeal phase, because I think there are definitely areas to be looked at for either reversible errors
[3:41:47.840 --> 3:41:52.400]  or, you know, hijinks or just, you know, incompetence in certain cases. I just,
[3:41:52.400 --> 3:41:57.680]  I really think that he has some avenues there. But the bottom line is StoneDefenseFund.com,
[3:41:57.680 --> 3:42:02.560]  anybody who can give a hand, you know, Roger needs it. I mean, this is just really a
[3:42:02.560 --> 3:42:07.360]  backbreaking thing for anybody to go through. I mean, specifically, though, you can't confirm
[3:42:07.360 --> 3:42:10.800]  or deny any of this and this great tourney we live in. But I mean, I heard this from reporters
[3:42:10.800 --> 3:42:16.320]  about the prosecutor, the lead guy talking about how he's going to be put in jail. And I do,
[3:42:16.320 --> 3:42:20.480]  because we're planning to hurt public safety. Did you hear that?
[3:42:21.520 --> 3:42:26.240]  Oh, I mean, I could tell you about that. There was an open court. So, you know, as soon as the
[3:42:26.240 --> 3:42:30.480]  verdicts were in, you come to the judge's decision as to what, you know, whether he,
[3:42:30.480 --> 3:42:35.520]  she's going to release him on his own, you know, not recognizance, but basically release him under
[3:42:35.520 --> 3:42:41.680]  his conditions that he was being, you know, existing before for his conditions of release,
[3:42:41.680 --> 3:42:45.200]  until the February 6th sentencing in this. Hold on. It's a cliffhanger short break.
[3:42:45.200 --> 3:42:49.280]  Come back with Tyler Nixon, final segment in War Room with Owen Schreuer. It's just insane
[3:42:49.280 --> 3:42:56.240]  what's going on. Stay with us. In full war's life has done it again with undoubtedly our biggest
[3:42:56.240 --> 3:43:04.480]  breakthrough yet. Super silver whitening toothpaste. This is proprietary. This is with the top lab in
[3:43:04.480 --> 3:43:11.040]  the country. And it is incredibly high quality. This is the best toothpaste you're going to find.
[3:43:11.040 --> 3:43:16.400]  It's called whitening toothpaste, but really it knocks out the bacteria. It recalcifies the teeth.
[3:43:16.400 --> 3:43:22.160]  It does so many things on so many fronts. These beautiful tubes of super silver
[3:43:22.160 --> 3:43:27.600]  toothpaste are available at an introductory price of 25% off out of the gates. It's as low as we
[3:43:27.600 --> 3:43:33.760]  can go. And they're going to sell out very, very quickly. Super silver whitening toothpaste is going
[3:43:33.760 --> 3:43:39.440]  to be a hit. I'm very, very proud of it. I want to thank my father, a retired dentist for spearheading
[3:43:39.440 --> 3:43:44.960]  this the last two years and developing it. It's 25% off out of the gates. That's as low as we can go
[3:43:44.960 --> 3:43:50.240]  because it's very, very expensive to produce. Get yours today at infowarslife.com.
[3:43:53.200 --> 3:44:00.000]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson. What is the level of tyranny
[3:44:01.280 --> 3:44:07.440]  that a tyrant will take humanity to? How far will they go? What's their limit? And he said it is the
[3:44:07.440 --> 3:44:17.360]  limit to which other men and women will submit. The answer is there is no limit to evil. It is a
[3:44:17.360 --> 3:44:24.080]  bottomless pit. We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist.
[3:44:24.960 --> 3:44:30.080]  Or that there's no free will. There's no devil or the God. But those very same people have all
[3:44:30.080 --> 3:44:37.280]  these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses
[3:44:37.280 --> 3:44:43.600]  can be like. They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us. Oxford's band
[3:44:43.600 --> 3:44:49.600]  Clapping. University of the US of band 21 Gun Salutes for Veterans. These people are dangerous cult
[3:44:49.600 --> 3:44:57.520]  leaders and it's time to reject them. The globalists know that I will never willingly give up. I've
[3:44:57.520 --> 3:45:04.880]  said it many times. I will never give in. I will never give up, but I could give out. And it's
[3:45:04.880 --> 3:45:11.120]  very very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity. To see evil
[3:45:11.120 --> 3:45:17.360]  running rampant like this and to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace.
[3:45:17.920 --> 3:45:23.440]  That most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech. And to know that most Americans
[3:45:24.080 --> 3:45:30.160]  feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the word about
[3:45:30.160 --> 3:45:36.720]  newswars.com, infowars.com and band.video. And that people are hungry for the truth now more than
[3:45:36.720 --> 3:45:42.480]  ever. And that if you tell people hey the band truth they don't want you to have is at infowars.com
[3:45:42.480 --> 3:45:48.000]  forward slash show and band.video. So take heart folks. They've had to censor everybody to show
[3:45:48.000 --> 3:45:54.160]  everybody down because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square. There's a famous
[3:45:54.160 --> 3:46:00.800]  quote by Marine Corps General in the Korean War when three million Chai comms had flooded across
[3:46:00.800 --> 3:46:08.320]  the border and surrounded the Marines. More than 50 to one some estimates have it. But the point is
[3:46:08.320 --> 3:46:13.360]  they were outnumbered and the general was told general were completely surrounded. He said good
[3:46:13.920 --> 3:46:21.760]  we can attack in all directions. Well that's the point that infowars has reached. And it really
[3:46:21.760 --> 3:46:26.400]  is epic. It really is biblical and we wouldn't have gone this far without all your support.
[3:46:27.360 --> 3:46:34.240]  But it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete. And it's not
[3:46:34.240 --> 3:46:38.960]  just Americans but folks all over the world are completely silenced when it comes to speaking
[3:46:38.960 --> 3:46:45.200]  the name of a CIA fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile or speaking out against dangerous
[3:46:45.200 --> 3:46:53.360]  vaccines because by infowars having its own platform that checkmates the globalists.
[3:47:45.360 --> 3:47:49.280]  All right folks Alex Jones here in the last segment of info wars live. I'm going to go over
[3:47:49.280 --> 3:47:55.440]  and co-host the war room from three to six p.m. with Owen shroyer and Kale mixed up names earlier
[3:47:55.440 --> 3:48:02.800]  sorry Kale Jeff Aaron Wilde Danny Dominic and Tyler. If you call the other number in the next
[3:48:02.800 --> 3:48:07.840]  five minutes we're going to open it up to the other studio. I will go right to your calls
[3:48:07.840 --> 3:48:13.280]  and go and play the music down thanks. We will go right to your phone calls right as we start the
[3:48:13.280 --> 3:48:18.560]  next show info wars dot com forward slash show the live show is linked up at drugs report dot com
[3:48:18.560 --> 3:48:23.840]  will add the feed of the war room there as continual live coverage of the roger stone show trial
[3:48:23.840 --> 3:48:27.920]  Tyler Nixon confident roger stone he's also a lawyer but not the lawyer in this case
[3:48:27.920 --> 3:48:32.400]  was there and he witnessed some of what I heard from reporters these bizarre statements about
[3:48:32.400 --> 3:48:36.880]  wanting to keep roger in prison because we're planning some sort of insurrection so this is
[3:48:36.880 --> 3:48:42.240]  more incredible prosecutorial attempted tyranny if confirmed Tyler I'm all ears believe me I tell
[3:48:42.240 --> 3:48:48.480]  us what you saw well so basically as a to pick up where I left off they were she was deciding
[3:48:48.480 --> 3:48:52.160]  just decide whether he could be released or you know because normally a defendant could be taken
[3:48:52.160 --> 3:48:57.680]  when they're convicted right then they could march him off and this does Jonathan Cravis the
[3:48:57.680 --> 3:49:04.640]  lead prosecutor stood up and started going on about how roger had violated the gag order previously
[3:49:04.640 --> 3:49:09.120]  and that given that the presumption is now against him because he's been convicted
[3:49:09.120 --> 3:49:13.680]  and that something about alex he said jones I don't even think he said alex jones he said something
[3:49:13.680 --> 3:49:19.840]  about jones comment you know indicates that the defendant had violated the blah blah blah and we
[3:49:19.840 --> 3:49:25.200]  think because the community interests and basically said he wanted roger carted off to prison right
[3:49:25.200 --> 3:49:30.800]  there I mean these people are twisted sick individuals they are malicious maligned soulless
[3:49:30.800 --> 3:49:34.640]  as far as I'm concerned and you know whatever I don't really give a crap what they think or have
[3:49:34.640 --> 3:49:39.600]  to say or whether I'm commenting on this again these are my comments my observations but and
[3:49:39.600 --> 3:49:43.200]  thankfully I will say for the judge she was very measured about it she said look I don't have any
[3:49:43.200 --> 3:49:49.120]  reason to believe mr stone is complied you know since the gag order her fuffle he had appeared at
[3:49:49.120 --> 3:49:55.280]  every appearance he's been there with you know bells on so to speak and he is complied with everything
[3:49:55.280 --> 3:49:58.880]  and she said I'm not gonna I've no reason to believe he would violate it so I'm gonna let him
[3:49:58.880 --> 3:50:04.640]  you know be released conditioned upon his continuing to have a gag order on which I just I find totally
[3:50:04.640 --> 3:50:10.400]  out late outrageous it's outrageous in the first place because I mean he wasn't even convicted
[3:50:10.400 --> 3:50:14.560]  of anything he was simply accused and he had his first amendment rights eliminated right there
[3:50:14.560 --> 3:50:21.680]  because you know of her taking recognizance of of media reports I was told by the media reports
[3:50:21.680 --> 3:50:26.160]  also that just Hannah Fairbanks is saying that rogers said that he fears for his life in prison
[3:50:26.160 --> 3:50:32.320]  like Epstein yeah I would if I were him I mean honestly you don't never know but why is his confidant
[3:50:32.320 --> 3:50:36.640]  are you not allowed to say that yes roger fears for his life because it's the case the man fears
[3:50:36.640 --> 3:50:41.920]  for his life in these dangerous deep state run prisons and we should be able to say it I mean
[3:50:41.920 --> 3:50:46.960]  if roger told me he fears for his life I should be able to say it damn it I mean he's never said
[3:50:46.960 --> 3:50:51.280]  that to me but I mean I don't think I mean rogers a pretty fearless guy you know he's definitely not
[3:50:51.280 --> 3:50:56.720]  there's no when it says that I'm saying I'm saying you know he's worried they might abstain
[3:50:57.920 --> 3:51:02.640]  well I mean I'd be worried about that as his friend because I just I mean they're so ruthless
[3:51:02.640 --> 3:51:08.080]  and so so hateful tour I mean just the hatred that you could just see these are angry
[3:51:09.040 --> 3:51:13.760]  evil people who have just malicious malign intent and they have really no concern about
[3:51:13.760 --> 3:51:19.200]  like the man's family or anything it's about notches in their in their prosecutorial gunbelts
[3:51:19.200 --> 3:51:24.240]  it's about you know doing one for their their overseers like Hillary and you know all the people
[3:51:24.240 --> 3:51:28.080]  behind the scenes you know I have no doubt that they've been back channeling with Adam Schiff all
[3:51:28.080 --> 3:51:33.040]  along you know in violation certainly of the intelligence committee rules as well as who knows
[3:51:33.040 --> 3:51:39.200]  what other DOJ ethics and other you know regulations might be violated but as Trump said today have you
[3:51:39.200 --> 3:51:44.720]  ever seen what's happened in the history of congress during impeachment being in the intelligence
[3:51:44.720 --> 3:51:50.720]  committee and republicans can't ask questions no I mean the whole thing is just a staged
[3:51:50.720 --> 3:51:55.200]  and you know what's sad is that the treatment of Roger Stone was like a prototype for how they've
[3:51:55.200 --> 3:51:59.920]  rolled this out and nobody held them to account for example when they heard his testimony in
[3:51:59.920 --> 3:52:05.360]  executive session and the intelligence committee rules explicitly say that you shall not and they
[3:52:05.360 --> 3:52:10.080]  sign a written oath in addition to their oaths of office saying they will you know obey those rules
[3:52:10.080 --> 3:52:14.960]  it says you will not disclose discuss or even cause to be disclosed or discuss any information
[3:52:14.960 --> 3:52:19.920]  provided in an executive session Adam Schiff wasn't minutes after Roger Stone's testimony on the air
[3:52:19.920 --> 3:52:24.480]  and Swalwell discussing and disclosing his testimony and nothing happens to these people
[3:52:24.480 --> 3:52:30.800]  and let's go further here the Justice Department and federal law enforcement at the top has been
[3:52:30.800 --> 3:52:34.640]  doing whatever they want to Mexican drug cartels and stuff like that for a long time now they're
[3:52:34.640 --> 3:52:40.800]  going after the political media class treating us like we're hardened criminals like they are a lot
[3:52:40.800 --> 3:52:46.800]  of them and people aren't going to put up with it and that's now that's it period period just
[3:52:46.800 --> 3:52:51.920]  because they called me last week a mafia Don intimidating witnesses and federal prosecutors
[3:52:51.920 --> 3:52:58.480]  that Obama appointed calling for my arrest in the news doesn't mean I'm a criminal when they
[3:52:58.480 --> 3:53:02.240]  call for Don Jr to be arrested and of course now it's come out of course you're supposed to say
[3:53:02.240 --> 3:53:07.280]  who whistleblowers are in the press but if this is the hoax where a federal prosecutor calls up
[3:53:07.280 --> 3:53:13.760]  the media and tells Google block the name Eric Saramella and they did it that is so damn dangerous
[3:53:14.480 --> 3:53:19.920]  yeah this is the definition of fascism Alex when you have large corporate entities that control
[3:53:19.920 --> 3:53:24.880]  major portions of say an economy in this case you know information flow and they work hand in hand
[3:53:24.880 --> 3:53:29.040]  with an authoritarian government where you can't tell the difference you can't tell where you know
[3:53:29.040 --> 3:53:33.920]  the digital media complex you know massive information complex ends and the government begins
[3:53:34.480 --> 3:53:38.080]  and then you know they're exploiting it it's all one way and the reason they're coming after this
[3:53:38.080 --> 3:53:42.240]  and after you know you so hard is is obvious because you're effective and they're scared
[3:53:42.240 --> 3:53:46.320]  you know otherwise they wouldn't care they don't go after people who are irrelevant to them so it's
[3:53:46.320 --> 3:53:52.720]  kind of a badge of honor and an homage to your effectiveness you know that they're coming after
[3:53:52.720 --> 3:53:57.520]  you and Roger Stone and you know the president must pardon Roger Stone end of story I mean I
[3:53:57.520 --> 3:54:03.440]  cannot believe that he would let his his longest standing soldier who took the hits for him
[3:54:03.440 --> 3:54:09.040]  Roger could have fled out and basically made up a bunch of stories like some of these witnesses have
[3:54:09.040 --> 3:54:14.480]  like some of the people who testified against him and perjured themselves and and gotten off you
[3:54:14.480 --> 3:54:18.240]  know with no charges he could have made this all go away if he had just made up lies about the
[3:54:18.240 --> 3:54:21.760]  president he said I will not do that I will never do that I will never testify or give false
[3:54:21.760 --> 3:54:27.760]  witness against the president and you know he took a hit from frankly Trump's DOJ this is under
[3:54:27.760 --> 3:54:32.160]  the authority of President Trump that this was done and Roger Stone was prosecuted and President
[3:54:32.160 --> 3:54:37.040]  Trump needs to start using his authority to right these wrongs and to mitigate the destruction being
[3:54:37.040 --> 3:54:43.200]  done by his political enemies who are absolutely insane with power and are ruthless and you know
[3:54:43.200 --> 3:54:47.280]  it's we need to stop playing games he needs to start using the executive power you're on fire
[3:54:47.280 --> 3:54:52.160]  I don't even want to Roger all day hell he might be there in the room but we can't say um he's not
[3:54:53.040 --> 3:54:57.120]  you've got another lawyer there you were telling me about him he should come on is there any way
[3:54:57.120 --> 3:55:00.400]  is there any way you could take like a 10 15 minute break or an hour break whatever you need
[3:55:00.400 --> 3:55:05.360]  to come on the war room with Owen Schreuer next I would I just confirmed that actually I will

[3:55:18.720 --> 3:55:23.760]  Bannon Steve Bannon you know I don't know how these people can be considered as anything but
[3:55:23.760 --> 3:55:28.240]  adversaries if not enemies of the president to go in and throw Roger Stone under the bus as Steve
[3:55:28.240 --> 3:55:33.440]  Bannon did with a bunch of nonsense about you know this vague testimony about Roger Stone being
[3:55:33.440 --> 3:55:38.800]  an access point for WikiLeaks where's the evidence not to mention where I was in on all that I was
[3:55:38.800 --> 3:55:42.400]  in on that with Roger when he was talking to Bannon and he told me I told Bannon we're trying to
[3:55:42.400 --> 3:55:46.000]  get a person to talk to him to find out what it is we're told it's Hillary that was all over the
[3:55:46.000 --> 3:55:52.640]  news this was totally innocuous insane garbage uh tell me uh to tell her how long until you're on
