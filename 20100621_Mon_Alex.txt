[01:19.000 --> 01:26.000]  people and to take over public schools and we have up close crisp video of this that the
[01:26.000 --> 01:32.000]  guy stayed this weekend they got back Friday the guy stayed here this weekend to go through

[01:51.000 --> 01:57.000]  prisonplanet.tv viewers will be able to watch it and it'll be archived up at prisonplanet.tv
[01:57.000 --> 02:03.000]  as well if you're unable to tune in during the last 30 minutes okay that said that a special
[02:03.000 --> 02:09.000]  broadcast last night I called to action anyway you slice at any angle you look at it this
[02:09.000 --> 02:16.000]  was a premeditated operation by BP they gave orders at the bare minimum that were consciously
[02:16.000 --> 02:21.000]  negligent knowing it would cause the well to come in and then explode into a fiery inferno
[02:21.000 --> 02:26.000]  killing 11 people they knew it would come in their engineers told them that they shouldn't
[02:26.000 --> 02:31.000]  do what they were doing it was unprecedented that's in the Coast Guard record from the
[02:31.000 --> 02:36.000]  hearings they had a few weeks ago now separately from that we know that the government is blocking
[02:36.000 --> 02:41.000]  the mitigation efforts in the Gulf in Louisiana Mississippi Florida and other areas and they're
[02:41.000 --> 02:46.000]  saying they're going to block mitigation as it goes around the coast of Florida not allow
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.000]  the state there as well to go in and clean it up under federal control so they want the
[02:51.000 --> 02:58.000]  disaster to be as bad as possible they are ham fistedly taking their time about trying
[02:58.000 --> 03:04.000]  to cap off the well they're talking about using a nuke which many experts say that the well's
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  already fractured and leaking up to 20 miles away that it will just fracture the entire
[03:08.000 --> 03:15.000]  structure even further and release even larger reservoirs of oil 2 billion gallons
[03:15.000 --> 03:22.000]  estimated to be just in this one reservoir area I have a call to action we need the states
[03:22.000 --> 03:27.000]  who are culpable in this for following unlawful federal edicts the states need to stop just
[03:27.000 --> 03:33.000]  whining jindal and barber and crest and others and they need to get up and declare their
[03:33.000 --> 03:38.000]  10th and 9th amendment and they need to have the sheriffs call together engineers and
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.000]  deputize people and go out there and everybody sign waivers who volunteer to be involved
[03:43.000 --> 03:48.000]  good old-fashioned American know-how and we can clean this up we can mitigate it we can
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.000]  stop it but no you got to have the federal Harvard boys up there the lawyers and the
[03:53.000 --> 03:59.000]  gallant little genius oh Nobel Prize winner who's been dispatched they've got to have
[03:59.000 --> 04:07.000]  them in there in everybody's face not letting anyone take action just like Katrina FEMA
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  for four or five six days blocking all a letting food and water pile up not letting people
[04:11.000 --> 04:17.000]  walk out on the highway overpasses they wanted to set the precedent they wanted to set the
[04:17.000 --> 04:22.000]  precedent big time that only federal control can come in and then when FEMA fell flat on
[04:22.000 --> 04:27.000]  its face by design oh look FEMA needs more funding more power more control to be able
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  to take care of these type of crisis in the future so I'm saying call these governors
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.000]  call these legislatures have them go into emergency session they do it for petty reasons all the
[04:36.000 --> 04:43.000]  time and have them have criminal state investigations and grand jury investigations at the county
[04:43.000 --> 04:51.000]  level to call in all these witnesses who were on the rigs and expand the facts so we understand
[04:51.000 --> 04:56.000]  exactly who at BP gave the orders to go ahead with dumping water into the well instead of
[04:56.000 --> 05:01.000]  mud and concrete we'll break it all down straight ahead stay with us hello friends this is Alex Jones

[08:14.000 --> 08:19.000]  welcome ladies and gentlemen again we're eight minutes into this Monday
[08:19.000 --> 08:27.000]  June 21st 2010 transmission Max Kaiser is joining us coming up in about an hour and 52 minutes from now
[08:27.000 --> 08:34.000]  I have really done my research on the BP spill and every indicator is this is an inside job
[08:34.000 --> 08:42.000]  and we see the motive we see the entire carbon tax agenda I shot a video late last night that
[08:42.000 --> 08:47.000]  Aaron stayed up until eight this morning to edit and put together it's up on infowars.com
[08:47.000 --> 08:56.000]  it's up on prisonplanet.com as one of the top stories and I'm asking all listeners to go to
[08:56.000 --> 09:05.000]  the website and get this video out to everyone you know the headline for the story that accompanies
[09:05.000 --> 09:12.000]  the video for those that do want to get this and get it out to everyone is criminal investigation
[09:12.000 --> 09:21.000]  of BP staged oil spill vital to gulf recovery they are going to continue to let it flow they're
[09:21.000 --> 09:26.000]  prepping the public for it to be allowed to flow at least until Christmas until they're able to ram
[09:26.000 --> 09:33.000]  through their global carbon tax it's also a political diversion as they gear up the Middle East
[09:33.000 --> 09:40.000]  for a new war against Iran and now even the Israeli papers are admitting that Israeli and US fleets
[09:40.000 --> 09:48.000]  are massing for an attack on Iran it also serves as a diversion for the internet takeover open
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.000]  admissions now that they are going to move to shut the internet down quote during a war
[09:53.000 --> 09:59.000]  or emergency so everything is coming together I'm going to play this video we're going to go into
[09:59.000 --> 10:05.000]  break I'm going to come back and give you the numbers for the governors of these Gulf states
[10:05.000 --> 10:14.000]  we're calling for a criminal investigation that may spook the big central banks that control BP
[10:14.000 --> 10:20.000]  like Goldman Sachs into backing off if they know that we're hot on their tail but only you the public
[10:20.000 --> 10:26.000]  have the power to get this info out let's go ahead and go to this audio from the special video
[10:26.000 --> 10:39.000]  it's June 21st 2010 it's Monday or more than 60 days into the BP oil spill my friends please watch
[10:39.000 --> 10:45.000]  this entire 10-minute presentation because I'm going to give you actual solutions to bring British
[10:45.000 --> 10:52.000]  petroleum and the controlled environmental lobby to justice this is all a giant attempt to bring
[10:52.000 --> 11:00.000]  in carbon taxes we have conclusive proof of means motive the whole nine yards there is no doubt
[11:00.000 --> 11:07.000]  that this at the bare minimum was premeditated negligence they gave the rig operators orders
[11:07.000 --> 11:15.000]  that they knew that they have been warned would cause this giant oil spill and now Obama is saying
[11:15.000 --> 11:20.000]  he wants the carbon tax at the end of this presentation I'm going to then give you solutions
[11:20.000 --> 11:25.000]  we have ways to bring these people to justice so stay with us till the end I'm going to go over
[11:25.000 --> 11:32.000]  different facets of this crisis from my research in the last 60 plus days I've really held my
[11:32.000 --> 11:38.000]  comment for a long time and just been doing deep research to really try to ascertain engage
[11:38.000 --> 11:44.000]  what's happening here and I have to say this blindsided me I never expected a false flag
[11:44.000 --> 11:50.000]  terror attack by the state by the global corporate system via a oil well but they're always inventing
[11:50.000 --> 11:57.000]  new ways to bring in crises to offer their solution global taxation and regulation we have
[11:57.000 --> 12:02.000]  an article on prisonplanet.com that details all of this the headline and it's at the bottom
[12:02.000 --> 12:07.000]  underneath this video I hope you click on it and read it states need to launch criminal
[12:07.000 --> 12:14.000]  investigation into BP federal government's role in oil spill mounting evidence shows disaster was
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.000]  deliberately contrived either through conscious neglect or outright sabotage and is being
[12:19.000 --> 12:26.000]  allowed to worsen and they're covering it up if you go to this article on prisonplanet.com
[12:26.000 --> 12:33.000]  it details with links and proof and the coast guard court record and mainstream media reports
[12:33.000 --> 12:41.000]  the information I'm about to boil down for you here number one BP this came out in the coast
[12:41.000 --> 12:46.000]  guard hearings with the survivors and the people running the well they're on site BP gave them
[12:46.000 --> 12:52.000]  orders that no one ever been given before in deep sea drilling and that was dump water into
[12:52.000 --> 12:58.000]  the drilling hole that was 30,000 feet down imagine an airplane at 30,000 feet looking down
[12:58.000 --> 13:03.000]  at cities they look like little tiny things below you that's how far down they drilled
[13:03.000 --> 13:08.000]  and British petroleum ordered Haliburton and others who were on the rig on record months
[13:08.000 --> 13:14.000]  before to carry out all sorts of shoddy procedures but then it got worse as the well began to
[13:14.000 --> 13:20.000]  come in as the gas and oil began to come up they said dump sea water in on it and keep
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.000]  drilling and they said we have to put semen in we have to put mud in as it's called in the
[13:24.000 --> 13:30.000]  industry we have to create plugs we have to have pressure we can't let this come in before
[13:30.000 --> 13:35.000]  we're ready or it will explode it'll be a disaster that's on record in the hearings via
[13:35.000 --> 13:40.000]  their satellite phones the head engineers all of them got in huge arguments and this is
[13:40.000 --> 13:46.000]  unprecedented with BP and Atlantic monthly and others have gotten the transcripts which you
[13:46.000 --> 13:51.000]  can read online of what happened in those Coast Guard hearings with the survivors and
[13:51.000 --> 13:56.000]  once the rig exploded and was on fire people in the rescue ships you know who'd been in
[13:56.000 --> 14:01.000]  arguments previously with the BP executives back in Houston were saying I hope you're
[14:01.000 --> 14:07.000]  f-ing happy because the well is now on fire do you understand I told you this was going
[14:07.000 --> 14:12.000]  to happen so bare minimum there needs to be a criminal investigation and criminal indictments
[14:12.000 --> 14:19.000]  of who gave those orders we have 11 dead people and a gulf full of toxic oil that's now
[14:19.000 --> 14:24.000]  off-gassing all sorts of even more deadly toxins causing all sorts of respiratory problems
[14:24.000 --> 14:30.000]  but then if you pull back and look at what happened before in the week before the spill
[14:30.000 --> 14:38.000]  back on April 20th 2010 things come into very clear focus number one the CEO of British
[14:38.000 --> 14:47.000]  petroleum dumped a third of his stock in the weeks before the spill then you have Goldman
[14:47.000 --> 14:56.000]  sacks that just so happened to have its CEO being the previous CEO of BP you have them dumping
[14:56.000 --> 15:03.000]  44% of their stock not another oil company just in BP in the week before then you add to
[15:03.000 --> 15:09.000]  that Halliburton buying just two weeks before the spill one of the biggest oil spill cleanup
[15:09.000 --> 15:14.000]  companies in the Gulf of Mexico which wasn't seen as a good buy by industry analysts at
[15:14.000 --> 15:20.000]  the time so you have all of this prepositioning but then you go back to the history who is
[15:20.000 --> 15:28.000]  British petroleum they were in on the meetings in 96 97 98 with Kenley of Enron with the head
[15:28.000 --> 15:33.000]  Bill from Goldman sacks on record in those meetings with Al Gore and Bill Clinton and
[15:33.000 --> 15:40.000]  others British petroleum was as a foundational company setting up the carbon tax and they
[15:40.000 --> 15:44.000]  were instrumental in getting the other oil companies in the last few years online to do
[15:44.000 --> 15:49.000]  this why because BP if you look at its power structure isn't just owned by the Queen of
[15:49.000 --> 15:54.000]  England she owns a large part and their partners with Dutch World Shell Queen Beatrix has some
[15:54.000 --> 15:58.000]  things and you've got Goldman sacks tied into the central banks is also one of the larger
[15:58.000 --> 16:02.000]  holders and they are all openly announcing that they had to have the Copenhagen Denmark
[16:02.000 --> 16:08.000]  Treaty that was going to be their new global funding mechanism at an international level
[16:08.000 --> 16:14.000]  for the new SDRs that was what was going to back up via a taxpayer of this new global
[16:14.000 --> 16:19.000]  cashless society currency that they've been announcing all over the news and when the
[16:19.000 --> 16:25.000]  Climategate emails came out in November that basically derailed their program because it
[16:25.000 --> 16:29.000]  exposed the fact that the government is using environmentalism as a way to enslave people
[16:29.000 --> 16:36.000]  and take over society and micromanage everyone and so BP you've seen at the magazines and TV ads
[16:36.000 --> 16:42.000]  and in airports the billboards just everywhere where BP is promoting carbon tax BP is promoting
[16:42.000 --> 16:47.000]  world government and so they've invested tens of billions of dollars in the last decade in
[16:47.000 --> 16:52.000]  promoting quote green energy because they're invested in taking over that whole new area
[16:52.000 --> 16:58.000]  of the economy they lay out the new infrastructure they own the new infrastructure and it's all
[16:58.000 --> 17:03.000]  about fleecing you nothing to do with the environment and so their whole agenda is in
[17:03.000 --> 17:08.000]  trouble and I said about a weekend of the BP spill I said look there are oil leaks there
[17:08.000 --> 17:15.000]  are oil spills this is BP they're one of the biggest contributors to Obama we need to look
[17:15.000 --> 17:21.000]  at this very very carefully but this could just be a regular oil spill and then you saw
[17:21.000 --> 17:28.000]  Obama blocking the response you saw BP blocking the states and individuals and corporations
[17:28.000 --> 17:33.000]  and foreign governments wanting to come in and help you saw them blocking berms being put up
[17:33.000 --> 17:39.000]  in front of the estuaries the rivers and wetlands so they have the motive they want the carbon
[17:39.000 --> 17:45.000]  tax they ordered the people on the well to do things they knew would cause it to explode
[17:45.000 --> 17:51.000]  and create a giant leak all of this was happening and then you have Obama blocking the response
[17:51.000 --> 17:57.000]  and I told people I said watch Obama is going to come out whether they stage this or not
[17:57.000 --> 18:01.000]  and as Rahm Emanuel said never let a crisis go to waste and they're going to call for
[18:01.000 --> 18:07.000]  taxes on the wellhead taxes at the gas pump taxes on your home federal inspections everything
[18:07.000 --> 18:11.000]  that's in the house bill that's now in the senate and sure enough last week he came out
[18:11.000 --> 18:17.000]  and said pass the greenhouse gas tax initiative pass this entire globalist takeover of the
[18:17.000 --> 18:22.000]  United States to pay the international banks even more money and it makes the bailout look
[18:22.000 --> 18:27.000]  like a pittance in comparison it only gets more horrifying when you learn that they're
[18:27.000 --> 18:33.000]  seriously looking at slant drilling in and detonating a hydrogen bomb and many geologists
[18:33.000 --> 18:38.000]  and experts who are all over the news are saying look you've already got this well ruptured
[18:38.000 --> 18:43.000]  you've already got 20 miles away oil plumes coming up from the undersea floor but it's
[18:43.000 --> 18:48.000]  probable not possible according to many experts that I respect that this will fracture the
[18:48.000 --> 18:55.000]  entire structure and will release even more oil but don't worry Obama bought and paid
[18:55.000 --> 19:01.000]  for by Goldman Sachs that controls BP they've got a solution they've got more taxes more

[24:18.000 --> 24:31.000]  alright guys let's go ahead and play the last part of that video
[24:31.000 --> 24:43.000]  this call to action and then I'm gonna give you the phone numbers one more time so you can call the governors the legislatures and we need to call the counties where the biggest cities are based in Louisiana and Mississippi
[24:43.000 --> 24:50.000]  and we need to say look instead of whining about the feds not letting you go out and clean oil up in your own rivers and estuaries
[24:50.000 --> 25:03.000]  in fact I've seen the maps on the news were up to 10 miles into shore the feds in Louisiana and Mississippi in those marshlands in those estuaries in those river systems those intercoastal islands
[25:03.000 --> 25:15.000]  up to 10 miles in they've got a line where no one is allowed to clean up oil no one is allowed to fish so now the feds are declaring jurisdiction in the states 10 miles in
[25:15.000 --> 25:28.000]  that just reminded me we also have mainstream news reporting Obama has declared a national park off limits to citizens they put up big signs saying don't go into these parks it's too dangerous basically seeding it to Mexico
[25:28.000 --> 25:39.000]  we're being run out of our own country ladies and gentlemen by the feds the feds do not represent America they represent international corporations looting America
[25:39.000 --> 25:49.000]  let's finish up with the video so we're all over the news are saying look you've already got this well ruptured you've already got 20 miles away oil plumes coming up from the undersea floor
[25:49.000 --> 25:59.000]  it's probable not possible according to many experts that I respect that this will fracture the entire structure and will release even more oil
[25:59.000 --> 26:09.000]  but don't worry Obama bought and paid for by Goldman Sachs that controls BP they've got a solution they've got more taxes more regulation more control for you
[26:09.000 --> 26:19.000]  this oil spill was tailor made for Obama you notice it happened a month after he announced drilling was allowed no one could believe it and then right on time this happens
[26:19.000 --> 26:29.000]  this is amazing you see the state government's complaining you see gentle and barber you know saying Obama is blocking their barges blocking their relief effort
[26:29.000 --> 26:42.000]  well then why don't they just call the legislatures into session and declare their tenth amendment powers and go out there and tell the Coast Guard that they're engaged in high treason and that they're not going to stand by and take their unlawful orders
[26:42.000 --> 26:58.000]  you call your legislatures you call your governors you tell them emergency sessions take action now you put the barges out there you call in the volunteers you take action you don't cop out and let Obama and BP you know tell you that they're the boss
[26:58.000 --> 27:13.000]  since you know who died and made BP King who died and made them God but here's the most important point you call those governors and those legislatures and you tell them have state grand juries county grand juries start investigations
[27:13.000 --> 27:27.000]  people have been harmed in Louisiana Mississippi and other states people died on that rig who are from those states their families need to go to grand juries and call for criminal investigations because in the Coast Guard report where they have the court hearing
[27:27.000 --> 27:38.000]  and interviewed the people that were on the rig they said they told BP that it was going to explode and that was going to happen but for some reason BP wanted that to happen
[27:38.000 --> 27:51.000]  so call these phone numbers and you tell them criminal investigations of BP and it's going to all lead back to Obama and the big central banks and Goldman Sachs that owns part of BP who want the carbon tax
[27:51.000 --> 28:04.000]  it's that simple their whole world government agenda tens of billions spent in the last few decades getting this fake environmental cult going to take control the carbon cycle and all human life and now it's in trouble
[28:04.000 --> 28:16.000]  the balls in your court folks take action get the phone numbers out of this article get it out to everybody you know and let them know criminal charges for BP and impeachment for Barack Hussein Obama
[28:16.000 --> 28:25.000]  take action ladies and gentlemen nothing can stop you
[28:25.000 --> 28:36.000]  my friends here are the numbers in case you missed them the office of governor Charlie Christ now these governors are bought and paid for each one of them I've done research on
[28:36.000 --> 28:49.000]  and of course the people of the states are aware of that as well Republican Democrat they're basically all globalist but you need to put pressure on them and the legislatures there are good people in the legislatures of Mississippi Louisiana Florida
[28:49.000 --> 29:04.000]  Alabama Texas is going to be affected when the hurricanes come in and blow the oil back towards us the East Coast will be affected that's where those currents go they should be hit the next month by the first oil that's already going through the keys and hitting Cuba
[29:04.000 --> 29:27.000]  so let me give you the number for the citizen hotline in the Florida governor's office 850-488-4441 850-488-4441 and you can email them this article that we wrote that gives all the proof of inside job and tell them you expect an investigation
[29:27.000 --> 29:41.000]  you can also ask when you call the governor's office for the main legislature number here's the Louisiana governor Bobby gendled that's 866-366-1121 866-366-1121

[30:09.000 --> 30:20.000]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[30:20.000 --> 30:29.000]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[30:29.000 --> 30:36.000]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[30:36.000 --> 30:45.000]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science

[33:17.000 --> 33:31.000]  the ball is in your court this radio broadcast reaches millions of activists people who are highly informed that understand the true political paradigm that we're facing globally
[33:31.000 --> 33:52.000]  understand what the new world order agenda is and if you decide to politically demand that state grand juries county grand juries state legislatures hold hearings and that local media cover it and that we start beating the drum for criminal charges on British petroleum
[33:52.000 --> 34:10.000]  just like within Ron they will start leaving the sinking ship they will start ratting each other out but we already have enough to convict from the Coast Guard hearings we have the evidence that they ordered those engineers months before to do things that
[34:10.000 --> 34:28.000]  first it was two weeks then a month now two months to do things that their engineers told them with the two different subcontractors they had would cause the well to come in an explosion and a giant fire that would cause the well to come in prematurely
[34:28.000 --> 34:44.000]  before they had the concrete plugs in place before they were ready to contain it they knew exactly what they were doing they gave the order and then you have BP
[34:44.000 --> 35:11.000]  who is at the heart of the global carbon tax system they developed it within Ron they developed it with Goldman Sachs in the Clinton years and you have the same gaggle of people in control right now and their entire agenda is in deep trouble and they give orders to the rig operators that they knew that they were told would cause this mega oil leak and loss of life in the
[35:11.000 --> 35:27.000]  Gulf now that's why BP and the feds are keeping the media out that's why they're not letting people wear respirators because then they have to admit it's it's off gassing deadly poison and that many miles in inland and the heavier areas of the spill people are having respiratory problems
[35:27.000 --> 35:43.000]  because they've got to cover this whole thing up and we have to point out that there's a cover up going on and one of the biggest facets of the cover up is the relationship of Obama and BP the media both the right wing controlled media and the left wing
[35:43.000 --> 35:58.000]  control media are playing along with the lie with the fable with the hoax that Obama is in a fight with BP and he'll make a few you know mean statements towards them BP's one of his biggest contributors BP financed
[35:58.000 --> 36:14.000]  Rama manuals apartment for many years when he was a congressman illegally in Washington that's mainstream news no one gets in trouble BP is at the heart I mean in fact guys will you pull it up I know we have it in the archive from a few months ago
[36:14.000 --> 36:34.000]  BP vice president establishes office of global governance or you can just search engine in YouTube BP commercial global governance where they're openly announcing world government I mean how many years have I told you BP's at the heart of the New World Order how many films have I made where I call them out
[36:34.000 --> 36:49.000]  in game made three and a half years ago I mean I'm not just now saying BP are these kingpins they continue to come up every time we get to the heart of the matter it's Goldman Sachs it's BP
[36:49.000 --> 37:06.000]  just like we always find people like Henry Kissinger Zbigniew Brzezinski and Donald Rumsfeld for over 30 years at the heart of any major scandal they're always sneaking around calling the shots they are the global
[37:06.000 --> 37:22.000]  controllers they get the orders from the big owners and then they implement they are the mega superpower managers the gophers the imperial legates BP is a key part of this and they've changed their name multiple times after
[37:22.000 --> 37:37.000]  coups they stage and other criminal activities and assassinations they've had three other names in the past and they are back and they're going to change their name again and you watch taxpayers are going to end up paying and BP has invested
[37:37.000 --> 37:54.000]  in the carbon exchange in Chicago the carbon exchange in New York the carbon exchange in London the carbon exchange in Paris the carbon exchange in Switzerland's capital the carbon exchange in Paris Berlin all of them
[37:54.000 --> 38:08.000]  they are one of the chief holders of the global carbon credits they hold billions in carbon credits that have gone from very profitable to now basically being junk bonds junk stocks toilet paper
[38:08.000 --> 38:24.000]  because of climategate which is the key global taxing mechanism to pay taxes directly from the individual to the IMF and World Bank themselves international versions of the Federal Reserve private holding companies of the mega six central
[38:24.000 --> 38:49.000]  private banks JPMorgan Chase Goldman Sachs City Bank Wells Fargo they are moving their entire agenda through right now and if we are able to expose this false flag I mean you can just see the meeting and saying we need a
[38:49.000 --> 39:04.000]  diversion to move the Israeli ships in the U.S. aircraft carriers into the Gulf and to move the weapons in the day of the Garcia we need a diversion from all the scandals of Rahm Emanuel and Obama having things illegally paid for and the
[39:04.000 --> 39:20.000]  Blagojevich trial where he's openly saying he was part of a payoff system with Obama when he came up with Obama under the Chicago mafia and the daily machine with Axelrod and of course Rahm Emanuel we need a diversion while we're getting our
[39:20.000 --> 39:35.000]  Internet Federal Internet FCC takeover with a government control box in your house that controls what you can see and tracks everything you watch that's in the AP and Financial Times of London openly announcing the new FCC plan with a control box in your house
[39:35.000 --> 39:51.000]  your cell phone wired to the government everything openly surveilled they need a diversion for all the anti gun bills and the U.N. small arms ban treaty that Obama says he's going to sign on to and it will trump U.S. Second Amendment law they need I mean there are so many things happening
[39:51.000 --> 40:07.000]  they're moving on every front the implementation of the government health care operation they need a story so big that in the news cycle going into the elections you forget about the health care takeover and then it helps them get their
[40:07.000 --> 40:22.000]  carbon tax through and they say they want the carbon tax and it will tax you we've got to get off oil and then we'll spend trillions of dollars and over the next decade on select global corporations with windmills and other systems that are owned by Al Gore and others
[40:22.000 --> 40:38.000]  and invested in by BP and the Queen of the Netherlands and the British Queen and and and and all of these people and Obama it's about them controlling the economy and controlling where money is invested they've already taken over the industries
[40:38.000 --> 40:53.000]  the factories have been shut down through napkin gap they've taken over what's left of the car industry they've nationalized their competition and shutting down record banks 80 plus shut down already this year the big regulators are all Goldman Sachs alumni feeding the banks into their
[40:53.000 --> 41:03.000]  private system I mean there is a total bum rush offensive taking over our society on every single front right now
[41:03.000 --> 41:13.000]  and you can see the grand analysis who benefits when something happens in Washington you can bet it wasn't by accident it was planned that way as Roosevelt said
[41:13.000 --> 41:23.000]  and this thing is planned not just Goldman Sachs dumping their stock the week before the or the BP CEO or Halliburton moving in with an oil cleanup company
[41:23.000 --> 41:38.000]  but then you have them blocking the oil mitigation you have them fumbling and and and and and fumbling and bumbling and dragging their feet and dealing with that oil spill
[41:38.000 --> 41:53.000]  you've got them with sensational you know headlines out there about nukes and detonating giant natural gas deposits and tsunamis just anything to keep your mind off of what's happening
[41:53.000 --> 42:08.000]  and what is happening while we're busy distracted London Telegraph Rahm Emanuel expected to quit White House Rahm Emanuel the White House Chief of Staff is expected to leave his job later this year after growing tired of the idealism of Barack Obama's
[42:08.000 --> 42:22.000]  inner circle so that's a spin how do we spend this he's under investigation as is being an Israeli spy he's admittedly a member of the Israeli military his dad was one of the founders of the Israeli terrorist group Ergonne Top Masad and Shin Bet
[42:22.000 --> 42:35.000]  how do we you know all this is coming out the Pentagon is really getting upset he's openly bossing Obama around in front of people there's criminal investigations being started how do we spin it like we're winning
[42:35.000 --> 42:50.000]  well we make Obama look good and say he's so idealistic that Rahm Emanuel's mad and is just leaving you know Obama Obama's expanded torture secret arrest wars media censorship he's the most secret president ever when he promised he'd be open and transparent
[42:50.000 --> 43:08.000]  hiring nothing but lobbyist doing everything Rahm Emanuel says no they know Obama is a one term president now they couldn't sell his cult of personality nothing to put it back together again no amount of staged oil leaks or even staged wars
[43:08.000 --> 43:21.000]  and so the rats are leaving the sinking ship so he won't be a political target if Emanuel stays in there he will be a continual unpopular target politically and they'll be a bigger drumbeat to send him to prison
[43:21.000 --> 43:35.000]  for all the different things he's done that are illegal and his connection to Blagojevich remember how Karl Rove left a few years before but was really still in DC advising and running everything so it's the same thing again he's just ducking for cover right now
[43:35.000 --> 43:51.000]  Washington insiders say he will quit within six to eight months in frustration at their unwillingness to bang heads together to get policy pushed through Mr. Emanuel 50 enjoys a good working relationship with Mr. Obama but they are understood to have
[43:51.000 --> 44:06.000]  recent understanding that differences over style mean he will serve only half the full four year term so Rahm Emanuel is out but these guys are such liars who knows if that's even true but I tend to look at it from my breakdown of history and think that it is true
[44:06.000 --> 44:22.000]  separately right on time the grandson of one of the heads of the ADL and Israeli Shin Bet comes out and of course he got arrested beating up Muslims out front their mosque in San Diego but now he's the top Al Qaeda commander
[44:22.000 --> 44:39.000]  number two Adam Gadan and he produces videos uploaded with the Al Qaeda watermark with the Pentagon Intel Center watermark in the same video layer they were produced and uploaded the same same place Adam Gadan pops up and says Obama your popularity is gone Al Qaeda is winning
[44:39.000 --> 44:54.000]  which means if you're against Obama you're for Al Qaeda very elementary oh you don't like Obama you're with Al Qaeda American white Al Qaeda is everywhere and here is the Associated Press and then right on time separately Al Qaeda warns of new attacks
[44:54.000 --> 45:11.000]  deadlier than before remember a month ago Washington Post the CIA admitted oh we put out fake bin Laden videos haha the public are idiots Al Qaeda warns of new attacks deadlier than before right as the Israeli and US Armada reaches Tehran right off their coast
[45:11.000 --> 45:34.000]  weapons systems aimed nuclear weapons aimed Israel openly now admitting they have nukes after 40 years of denying and saying they'll nuke Iran World War three on the verge of it it's in the Israeli papers but not in the US papers you don't tell Americans about that Americans are busy talking about the oil spill and LeBron James appreciation day and the World Cup
[45:34.000 --> 45:56.000]  so but but right on time oh Al Qaeda is gonna hit us oh watch Al Qaeda hit and then bin Laden's in Iran oh they have the proof yes they give no proof they just say oh a message board claimed it and and and so now see we had to nuke them we had to nuke them because now they're on the news again saying they could launch a nuke and hit the US any day
[45:56.000 --> 46:11.000]  just like with Iraq they could launch a nuke and they could hit us any time it's it's they've got secret magnetic pulse weapons to it's either yeah I mean I mean they're like Cobra Commander they just we've got to attack them right now because the world's going into a
[46:11.000 --> 46:27.000]  a depression and they need a political distraction because it's also in the AP that the feds and the states are moving and taking part or all of pension funds and so they've got to have a war while they take your pension funds so you forget about that Al Qaeda US born spokesman
[46:27.000 --> 46:44.000]  President Barack Obama Sunday at the militant group may launch new attacks that would kill more Americans than previous ones oh in a taunting 24 minute message that dwelled on Obama setbacks the grandson of the ADL board member course they don't add that
[46:44.000 --> 47:00.000]  including the loss of Massachusetts Senate seat to Republicans oh see now if you are for the Republicans taking back the Congress you're with Al Qaeda I mean do you really believe this is so asinine ladies and gentlemen I could put a fake beard on
[47:00.000 --> 47:15.000]  and claim I was an Al Qaeda leader and literally the news would pick it up number four years ago they had the guy saw off the head in a fake beheading in San Francisco and the news for two weeks reported it was real every week I see AP articles have been locked and says he's going to strike us again and the last paragraph of the
[47:15.000 --> 47:32.000]  article say it was posted on a message board and it's not authentic in a taunting 24 minute message that dwelled on Obama setbacks including the loss of Massachusetts Senate seat to Republicans Adam good on set out Al Qaeda's conditions for peace with the US including
[47:32.000 --> 47:51.000]  cutting support for Israel and the drawing of trips from Afghanistan will never give into you Al Qaeda the average good old boy here's that says I'd like to get my hands on that good on I guess torture is good I tell you that Al Qaeda so dirty I will never give into you Al Qaeda so again that that
[47:51.000 --> 48:06.000]  makes it look like Al Qaeda you know actually exist good on said that if you compare the number of dead Muslims with the relatively small number of Americans we have killed so far becomes crystal clear that we haven't even begun even the score to even the score
[48:06.000 --> 48:22.000]  he said dressed in a white robe and turban directly from the Pentagon guaranteed he takes the beard off goes out and enjoys his life that's why next time we might not show the restraint and self control we have shown up until now that's going to be Obama nuking us
[48:22.000 --> 48:38.000]  and then he's going to come after the American people you just watch he said even if Al Qaeda was defeated hundreds of millions of Muslims would still fight the US he added of course none of the Muslim countries by this I mean a Jewish kid in a stupid turban and a fake beard up there going
[48:38.000 --> 48:52.000]  Dirkadirka Dirkadirka Allah Allah Allah I mean come on folks Al Qaeda offered the same conditions for an end to hostilities to then President George W. Bush's 2007 including the release of all Muslim prisoners and cutting off aid of the Middle East
[48:52.000 --> 49:08.000]  so that's basically Ron Paul's position so she now you're for cutting off foreign aid to all these governments you're Al Qaeda the Don statement was notable for his mocking tone so it's meant to anger you in which he described Obama as a devious evasive
[49:08.000 --> 49:26.000]  and serpentine American president with a Muslim name so see now if you call Obama a liar it's like you're with that Al Qaeda this is all tailored to 100% CIA and we have a CIA who admits they put out fake videos and laugh at you that's how dumb they think
[49:26.000 --> 49:41.000]  you are because they know the average public doesn't read that article spy talk the weekly column where they laugh at you every week and seem to delight in the setbacks oh see Al Qaeda is delighting in a setbacks well we won't let them delight in the setbacks we'll never leave the Middle East
[49:41.000 --> 49:54.000]  I support it no matter what you're not gonna win good on I'll show you I'll support the war no matter how bankrupt we are never mind we're shipping out the opium that's how we beat good on
[49:54.000 --> 50:03.000]  you're no longer the popular man you once were a year ago or so he crowed ascribing his drop of popularity to the escalation of the U.S. wars abroad
[50:03.000 --> 50:17.000]  at the time of Obama's election many analysts said Al Qaeda was worried that his race and Muslim family connections would make him more appealing to Muslims and Arabs angry at Bush's foreign policy
[50:17.000 --> 50:27.000]  in its statement since his election Adam Al Qaeda good on has taken a page to show the continuation between Obama's foreign policy and that of its predecessor
[50:27.000 --> 50:39.000]  good on is wanted by the FBI in 2004 for a one million dollar reward for information leading to his arrest or conviction he is also known as a seam Al Armacari Arabic for the American
[50:39.000 --> 50:49.000]  but what a member of two months ago they announced he's been caught he's been caught in Pakistan U.S. has got him and I came out and said I guarantee you that's a lie three days from now as a minor footnote
[50:49.000 --> 50:58.000]  they'll admit he wasn't arrested but the average sheep who are barely listening will think oh he was already captured and then will think I'm discredited for saying he is Mossad slash CIA
[50:58.000 --> 51:02.000]  but you notice he's back
[51:02.000 --> 51:10.000]  remain in your houses the president of the United States has declared martial law under executive order 11,004
[51:10.000 --> 51:20.000]  will they do it will they pull the trigger this time we all pray they stand down but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day
[51:20.000 --> 51:36.000]  think it can happen here executive order 10,990 locks down all highways executive order 10,995 ceases control of all media outlets executive order 10,998 controls all farms and food supplies
[51:36.000 --> 51:42.000]  all these executive orders are now cocked loaded and waiting for the right crisis
[51:42.000 --> 51:50.000]  so if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America or have questions about how to survive it go to martiallawsurvival.com

[51:56.000 --> 52:00.000]  you must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned
[52:00.000 --> 52:05.000]  the question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand
[52:05.000 --> 52:08.000]  what have we got a republic or a monarchy
[52:08.000 --> 52:12.000]  a republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights
[52:12.000 --> 52:16.000]  not democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner
[52:16.000 --> 52:22.000]  so they think they own our land they think they own our water children our education our money
[52:22.000 --> 52:26.000]  we have to define who we are and what we will tolerate
[52:26.000 --> 52:30.000]  somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the patriot uprising
[52:30.000 --> 52:31.000]  you have been warned
[52:31.000 --> 52:35.000]  we have the facts we have the constitution we have the bill of rights we have common law

[53:56.000 --> 54:01.000]  that's goberkey.com today
[54:09.000 --> 54:14.000]  Ladies and gentlemen I am ranting because everything is coming together right now
[54:14.000 --> 54:20.000]  this is out of the israelinationalnews.com
[54:20.000 --> 54:23.000]  and I'm not good at reading Hebrew but the name of the newspaper is
[54:23.000 --> 54:27.000]  Harouts Shahiva Israeli National News
[54:27.000 --> 54:33.000]  US Israeli warships ensuez may be prelude to face off with Iran
[54:33.000 --> 54:39.000]  now remember early last week we read press TV that's the one of the official Iranian organs
[54:39.000 --> 54:43.000]  international television they're equivalent to Al Jazeera
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.000]  in fact let me just pull up that quote
[54:45.000 --> 54:50.000]  Iran threatens to stop western ships if subjected to cargo inspections
[54:50.000 --> 54:57.000]  we warn the US in certain adventurous countries that if they are tempted to inspect Iranian air
[54:57.000 --> 55:02.000]  and ship cargos we will take tough action against their ships in the Persian Gulf
[55:02.000 --> 55:05.000]  and the sea of Oman said Iranian parliament speaker
[55:05.000 --> 55:10.000]  he went on to say any retaliatory move would be part of the country's policy to defend national interest
[55:10.000 --> 55:14.000]  according to farce news agency and press TV
[55:14.000 --> 55:20.000]  the government spokesman called on the government to not lessen the level of uranium enrichment below 20%
[55:20.000 --> 55:26.000]  now remember Iran cannot make nukes with the enriched uranium they have
[55:26.000 --> 55:29.000]  they've offered to give it to France to others to finish enriching
[55:29.000 --> 55:35.000]  and they've been told no so they do not want nukes they are not developing nukes
[55:35.000 --> 55:41.000]  and the US and Israel are saying they're going to block gasoline shipments into Iran and other materials
[55:41.000 --> 55:45.000]  because Iran has a lot of oil but only half the refining capacity
[55:45.000 --> 55:49.000]  so imagine Iran says you want to blockade us so we don't get gasoline
[55:49.000 --> 55:52.000]  bring us to a standstill that's an act of war
[55:52.000 --> 55:55.000]  but then we want nuclear reactors for our electricity
[55:55.000 --> 55:58.000]  so that we're not oil dependent and you won't let us have that
[55:58.000 --> 56:01.000]  and so now you're going to have a blockade of us
[56:01.000 --> 56:06.000]  ladies and gentlemen we do not need war with Iran
[56:06.000 --> 56:11.000]  okay and I'm not saying the Iranian government is perfect you know the media plays this game of
[56:11.000 --> 56:14.000]  you're either for war with Iran or you're with Iran
[56:14.000 --> 56:19.000]  no no I'm against war ladies and gentlemen all these governments are evil
[56:19.000 --> 56:24.000]  all these governments are corrupt when you study history you can count on one hand
[56:24.000 --> 56:29.000]  in all the governments in Asia Europe the Middle East the Americas
[56:29.000 --> 56:35.000]  you can count on one hand governments for short periods that were altruistic and good
[56:35.000 --> 56:39.000]  and there are literally thousands of governments in hundreds of nations
[56:39.000 --> 56:44.000]  that have come and gone all different variants of corruption and tyranny
[56:44.000 --> 56:48.000]  okay Iran is bad the United States is bad
[56:48.000 --> 56:53.000]  Israel is bad Germany is bad Russia is bad Japan is bad
[56:53.000 --> 56:56.000]  it's all criminal classes up there ripping you off
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.000]  the question is how bad is the criminal class
[56:59.000 --> 57:03.000]  how out of control is the criminal class
[57:03.000 --> 57:09.000]  it is the nature of power and there is a global empire that wants to start World War 3
[57:09.000 --> 57:12.000]  as a political smoke screen to get nations in more debt
[57:12.000 --> 57:17.000]  and to distract the public while they complete their world government
[57:17.000 --> 57:20.000]  while they complete their world government
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.000]  while they get their global tax in place their carbon tax
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  and that's what this BP oil spill does
[57:26.000 --> 57:31.000]  that's why it is life and death to point out that this is criminal negligence bare minimum
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  there should be criminal indictments now
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.000]  grand jury should be in panel now for indictments
[57:36.000 --> 57:40.000]  handing down indictments and it goes past that the investigation will open up
[57:40.000 --> 57:45.000]  this was premeditated okay because every evidence is they're blocking the recovery
[57:45.000 --> 57:47.000]  they did everything they could to cause this to happen
[57:47.000 --> 57:52.000]  if we don't get the word out on this they are going to get away with their entire operation
[57:52.000 --> 57:55.000]  we are on the verge of World War 3 starting
[57:55.000 --> 57:58.000]  we are on the verge of the carbon taxes passing
[57:58.000 --> 58:02.000]  we are on the verge of the global transformation as David Rockefeller said
[58:02.000 --> 58:04.000]  we are on the verge of a global transformation
[58:04.000 --> 58:08.000]  all the nations need is the right crisis and they will accept the new world order
[58:08.000 --> 58:10.000]  that's a quote
[58:12.000 --> 58:14.000]  I actually flipped it around
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  we are on the verge of a global transformation
[58:16.000 --> 58:19.000]  all we need is the right crisis and the nations will accept the new world order
[58:19.000 --> 58:29.000]  there that's the exact quote by David Rockefeller
[58:50.000 --> 58:55.000]  Hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator

[59:01.000 --> 59:04.000]  by breathing the solution through the lungs
[59:04.000 --> 59:08.000]  the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses
[59:08.000 --> 59:12.000]  the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[59:12.000 --> 59:15.000]  with your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[59:15.000 --> 59:20.000]  and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream
[59:20.000 --> 59:24.000]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products
[59:24.000 --> 59:28.000]  you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[59:28.000 --> 59:30.000]  with the Silver Lungs Generator

[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000]  and now live from Austin, Texas
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  Alex Jones
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  We're now into hour number two, we got Max Kaiser coming up in one hour
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  I've got news on the attacks on the First Amendment
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  the latest on the BP oil spill, Rahm Emanuel to step down in the next few months
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  we've got San Francisco Chronicle reporting
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  Japanese, Russian and US warships dock in San Francisco
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  we videotaped last week in Chicago
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  Polish foreign troops training with army and local police for gun confiscation
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  we're going to cover that in the last 30 minutes of the show today
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  we're going to go live at prisonplanet.tv and simulcast
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  the last half of the radio show coming up in the third and fourth hour
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  so starting in the next hour
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  we've got Max Kaiser coming up in the next hour
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  but I do want to open the phones up on any of the news items I've thrown out here
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  the Armadas arriving, the Israeli and US Armadas off the coast of Iran
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  openly saying they may launch preemptive nuke attacks on Iran
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  openly saying they're waiting for the UN to pass
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  sometime this week blockade instructions to begin boarding Iranian ships
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  that are just involved in fishing, involved in commerce
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  a serious act of war
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  imagine if Iranian ships pulled up in New York and said we're going to search ships in New York harbor
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  I mean as Ron Paul has said this is war, this is an act of war
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  so we'll be discussing that
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  I've got bank failure as 83rd in 2010
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  pace more than double last year's bank failures USA today
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  Lieberman says China can shut down the internet
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  why can't we, that's a quote
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  that video clip is coming up later in the broadcast as well
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  but I want to go to your phone calls but I want you to have your question, your comment ready
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  because I'm going to go to a gamut of calls at
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  1-800-259-9231
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  1-800-259-9231
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  when we get back on any of the issues I've raised or any points that you want to raise
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  but so we can get to everybody, I'm going to give each person, I always say this
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  and I'm getting a little bit better at it over the years
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  we never, never achieve the goal
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  we'll see the days of the day
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll for each number to join us
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  and then coming up after that
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  Obama gives major swath of Arizona back to Mexico
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  just makes my head spin sometimes
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  but again, we can't get 4,000 people in Louisiana or Mississippi or Florida or Texas
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  or New Jersey for that matter
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  that's going to be hit by the oil spill or Georgia
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  out calling for criminal indictments of the BP execs that ordered them to drill the well
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  in a way that they knew it would blow up
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  that's in the Coast Guard testimony by the survivors and the head engineers
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  no, but we can get them all out to LeBron James
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  he's going to leave the Cavaliers that's been reported, he's looking at it
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  and so upwards of 4,000 attendees
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  had shown up for the 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. meeting at the convention center
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  at the 30,000 seat facility
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  and then he wasn't going to show up
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  but he got calls and said you better show up
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  the last 10 minutes he showed up
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  and didn't even say he'd stayed with the Cavaliers
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  and they were groveling and crying
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  and they stampeded each other trying to get to him
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  just to see the God in the flesh
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  their heroes aren't inventors, they aren't trailblazers
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  they aren't explorers, they aren't patriots
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  they aren't people of courage
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  they aren't people who help the hungry or the homeless
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  or the starving
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  they aren't deep-sea divers
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  back when this country was great, that was our heroes
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  people were in to the real deal
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  people were in to explorers and adventurers and scientists
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  that's why we were number one in the world
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  note now the globalists have given us
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  football players, baseball players
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  gladiatorial UFC fighters
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  just like Rome
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  and that's what matters to people
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  people have chosen to riot with glee when the Lakers win
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  and burn cars and attack people
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  and wave foreign flags and celebrate
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  that's what's valued now
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  that's why the elite have said look, the public are chumps
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  let's rape them, let's rob them
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  the sky's the limit, we've turned these people into drones
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  that can hardly talk
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  large groups of the public have listened to them
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  can't even hardly talk
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  they just jibber and jabber
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  we'll be back
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  this is alex jones with five good reasons
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  you should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  number one, new climate legislation
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000]  number two, our new energies are
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000]  it's true, total government control of electricity
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  number three, in some areas of the country
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000]  and now, new socialist legislation
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  is only compounding the problem
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  and peace of mind
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000]  one of my old sponsors

[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000]  there is nothing like these factory direct

[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  to which our republic does fall
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  It's only the beginning of the new world orders
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  hellish plan
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.560]  the police state isn't coming

[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:09.000]  a war on for your mind.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:17.160]  Okay, I will continue to break down the latest on the BP oil spill, conclusive evidence
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:21.200]  that it was a staid, false flag event as a political diversion from the start of World
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:27.520]  War 3 with Iran, and to pass the carbon taxes, that's just the surface, and we'll be going
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:28.520]  over that.
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:32.520]  I got a bunch of financial news, Max Kaiser joins us in the next hour, but without further
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:36.680]  ado, I am going to your phone calls.
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:39.120]  John, in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:40.120]  Thanks for holding.
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.120]  Hi, Alex.
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:42.120]  Welcome.
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:49.280]  I'm looking at the Houston Chronicle, the June 7th business section, and it says China
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:54.120]  winning major oil deals in Iraq, so basically they're moving in, they're taking over, I
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:57.760]  would say taking over, but they're giving it oil to them, you know?
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:02.880]  And when I see these people, they've had some funerals here in Houston, people are killed
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:07.800]  over there, and people are saying, oh, he was a hero, he died for our freedom.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:11.200]  No, he didn't die for our freedom, he died for the Chinese Reds, could take over the
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:15.000]  whole area, and they take control of the oil and the minerals.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.300]  Well, it's now been declassified that the United States signed secret treaties with
[01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:27.640]  Mao Zedong in 1949, and sold out Shanghai Shek, and that is declassified on record.
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:31.400]  They even have old CIA guys bragging about it on the History Channel, and that's why
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:35.400]  the Chinese communists were given the Panama Canal, that's why they were given the Long
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:38.000]  Beach Naval Facility.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.200]  America is wide open, America is wide open because we were an open form of government,
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:48.160]  and that's just like BP getting 80% under contract of all the oil that comes out of
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:50.680]  Alaska under federal law.
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:55.360]  They said, oh, you're a multinational, foreign, globalist company that the Queen of England
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:10:00.240]  owns a large part of, we're going, and this is back in the 70s, till today, we're going
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:06.080]  to give you that oil, and then that oil is shipped via tankers to Asia, that this is
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:12.440]  all public, and then 20% is brought down into Canada, on the West Coast, and into California.
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:16.400]  That's why there's so many British Petroleums in California because they have an unfair
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:22.000]  trade practice with the cheaper oil coming in via the pipeline, and other companies
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.760]  have lobbied, smaller companies have lobbied, they're not allowed to get the Alaskan oil,
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:28.760]  period.
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:35.600]  And yes, I did see that report, BP, Dutch Royal Shell, and the Chinese are getting most
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:41.360]  of the oil fields, there really are no big U.S. oil companies, they're all multinational,
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:45.740]  based on mobile and others, but no, they're not going to get the oil, foreigners are.
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:52.160]  This is all agreed upon, and the globalist, just like Hitler and Stalin divided Poland
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:57.240]  in 1939 amongst themselves, and then later went to war, the people controlling our society
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:00.560]  divide up the planet in agreements.
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:06.360]  They say, look, we're going to be in Taiwan and Japan, you get to be in Panama, or we're
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:09.480]  going to get your port, you're going to get Long Beach.
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:13.560]  That's why it came out that not one, not two, not 10, not 20, when they were done, it was
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:19.080]  over 60 U.S. ports were being given to the government of Dubai, and then Bush came out
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:23.080]  and said, look, they're buying our dollars, we've got to give them real assets.
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:25.100]  That's the globalist's sick joke.
[01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:31.400]  These foreigners get to buy up fiat currency here, and then come in and buy real assets.
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:33.320]  It's a giant monopoly game.
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:40.640]  And so you've got the Arabs and Israel and the Communist Chinese and England and Europe
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:45.480]  all teamed up in this globalist model.
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:51.640]  So by controlling America, here's an example, banning all U.S. drilling in the Gulf, and
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:56.240]  any company that does big business in the U.S. isn't able to now drill in the Gulf, so they
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:01.920]  all create foreign subsidiaries, and it turns out that George Soros, Al Gore, and others,
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:09.960]  they're all invested in Venezuelan, in Chilean, in Brazilians, this is in the news yesterday,
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:12.520]  and they're all moving their rigs into the Gulf.
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:14.440]  No one's going to stop them drilling in the Gulf.
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:16.960]  No, no, no, it's only the U.S. that is.
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:21.520]  So by the U.S. government having control over that, that automatically boosts the price
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:26.760]  of oil and the stocks of the multinational drilling systems.
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:33.480]  And again, what you're saying is absolutely essential, John, and is dead on and shows
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:36.760]  how the people running our country are a pack of crooks.
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:43.040]  Well, the big joke is on all of us, I'm a Vietnam veteran, we were fighting to stop
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:47.760]  communism in Asia, now the communist control, our whole economy, and the Iraqis, the guys
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:51.240]  fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, they're basically getting stabbed in the back, too.
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:54.720]  They're just fighting for these corporations along with communist China to take control
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:55.720]  of the world.
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:57.560]  That's the joke, Alex.
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:58.560]  It is.
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:12:59.560]  I appreciate your call.
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:00.560]  God bless you, John.
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:04.520]  And people need to grow up and face the facts as forth as you lie coming up.
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:09.280]  If you want to save America and the republic, our constitutional republic, you better admit
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:12.920]  to yourself that this country has gangrene.
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:14.240]  You don't have a stub toe, folks.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:20.280]  We've got gangrene together, and it's going to kill us if we don't seriously engage in
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:23.400]  some serious surgery.
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:24.920]  There's nothing else we can do.
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:25.920]  It's going to be painful.
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:29.000]  We're going to have to lose a leg here.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.520]  But unlike individuals, countries can grow a leg back, kind of like a salamander can
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:35.360]  grow its tail.
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:39.360]  But now is the time to quit screwing around.
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:44.800]  The individuals running our country are globalists, and they hate the sovereignty of the United
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:45.800]  States.
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:50.920]  They hate the Second Amendment, and they will do whatever they can to bankrupt us and bring
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:53.360]  us into economic bondage.
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:58.920]  That is the goal, because once the United States is fully fallen to tyranny, they know
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:04.040]  it's going to be an even bigger uphill battle worldwide to reverse this global corporate
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:08.200]  eugenics state that has been set up.
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:15.680]  I cannot express to you the magnitude of what we're facing.
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:21.600]  It is incalculable.
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:24.960]  It is incalculable.
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:31.320]  You cannot calculate just the human devastation and the bondage and the slavery and how horrible
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:32.320]  this is.
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.720]  Let's go to George in Pennsylvania.
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:35.880]  You're on the air, George.
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:40.120]  Thank you so much for your service to our country, two things.
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:44.480]  Have you considered setting up a bulletin board service like we used to use before there
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:51.140]  was internet so we could log on to your show and download some programs?
[01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:59.480]  We do have a system where you can call a number and listen for free on the direct listener
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:03.480]  line, and that's up on infowars.com in the listen page.
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:08.480]  That cost us, I think it's, what, $4,000 a month now, but we have a sponsor that pays
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:14.360]  for that, and we have tens of thousands of people a week that just call that number to
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:18.840]  listen, and so we're trying that way.
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:22.400]  I've got a bunch of internet projects I'm trying to launch right now, but we just don't
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:30.520]  have the money or personnel to even get those done in a timely fashion, and so I'm working
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:36.520]  on a lot of things, but everyone should move towards creating alternatives.
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:43.040]  The problem is that we don't need to just focus on in runs once they shut us down.
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:47.920]  We need to fight against the government takeover and restriction and censorship of the web
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:49.120]  before they do it.
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:53.240]  We need to not just see it as a foregone conclusion.
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:16:00.320]  We need to prepare for the worst, but also continue to try to defend what we've got.
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:06.940]  Second thing is that I'd like to see a donate section on your website for hosting or what
[01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:11.160]  I would like to see is more on-scene reporting like when you went to Montana, I'd like to
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:19.080]  be able to support specific items, and I'd be pretty generous with it, and I'm sure other
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:22.760]  people would if there was a large donate button, especially if they could pick what
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:25.920]  they would like to contribute to.
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:29.120]  We've got a donate button somewhere.
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:34.400]  I think it's hidden somewhere on the site, but I'll have Curt Nimo put the donate button
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:39.400]  on the listen page on infowars.com because I keep getting emails every day saying, where's
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:40.680]  a donate button?
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:44.320]  The best way to donate because you know you're getting a tool that'll wake people up is to
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:49.360]  buy Fall of the Republic, Obama Deception, Invisible Empire, a new order to find and
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:52.040]  to get those out to people, but thank you so much, George.
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:55.640]  We couldn't do any of this without the PrisonPlanet.tv members, the people that buy the books
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:58.320]  and videos and materials off the site.
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:03.920]  Everything we do is because of you, but it's more than just get more funds in so I can
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:06.240]  have people go out and report for us.
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:08.320]  We'd have to then actually hire more people.
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:12.720]  I've only got three or four guys that are able to get on planes and flyplaces and of
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:16.640]  course there's myself, but I'm pretty much nailed down to doing this radio show most
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:17.640]  of the time.
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:21.240]  Even if I'm going to even spend Saturday with my family, that's really the only day I take
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:22.240]  off.
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:29.160]  Sometimes I take Sundays off, but there's so much I want to do.
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:32.080]  But again, thank you for your support.
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.840]  Let's go ahead and talk to Julio in Illinois.
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:34.840]  Julio, welcome.
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:38.640]  Alex Jones, happy belated Father's Day to you.
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:44.720]  Quickly, I'm going to ask people to go to your Facebook page, post a bunch of BP British
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:48.400]  Petroleum commercials about climate change, carbon footprint.
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:53.400]  If you'd like to play that on your show later on, also Barry Satoro, admitting that cap
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:58.760]  and trade will skyrocket electricity prices and the corporate...
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:03.200]  Now he said the goal is to bankrupt coal and it will double prices.
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:05.240]  I posted that on your Facebook page.
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:10.920]  Also, I posted something about my university, Western Illinois University, getting set to
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:15.400]  have a Department of Homeland Security.
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:21.280]  I posted on your Facebook page, Homeland Security Intelligence Academy and one of the directors
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:26.800]  is named Dean Alexander, who worked for the World Bank, the North American Free Trade
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:33.680]  Agreement Research Institute, the State Department, UBS Financial Services here in the U.S. Dangerous
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:34.680]  stuff.
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:35.680]  Western Illinois is a huge...
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:36.680]  Oh, yeah.
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:38.960]  No, that's in the Cyber Security Act.
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:45.480]  Every high school, every college, by law, this is what Rahm Emanuel talked about on
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:47.400]  C-SPAM where you'll have to serve.
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:52.880]  You will be forced as part of your community service every year in high school and college
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:58.480]  to serve in the cyber brigade and it says to go out and censor and tattle on people.
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:00.240]  I mean, it's actually in there.
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:06.160]  It's actually in the AP and Financial Times of London with the quotes from the FCC proposal
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:12.600]  to put a box in your house that blocks what you can read and spies on everything you do.
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:17.560]  All ISPs with more than 100 customers will have a box in them tracking everything they
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:18.560]  do.
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:19.560]  Total control.
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:24.640]  That's even worse than the communist Chinese model and now Lieberman is on CNN, the clips
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:30.440]  up on infowars.com, Lieberman headline, China can shut down the Internet.
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:32.040]  Why can't we?
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.280]  He actually said that.
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:37.400]  I mean, the magnitude of how they're out in the open.
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:38.800]  This is naked.
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:40.200]  They're not even hiding this anymore.
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:41.440]  Who are we owe great points?
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:42.440]  Anything else?
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.240]  Yeah, one last thing.
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:47.000]  Going into what Rob Drew is going to talk about later on.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:52.280]  Bensonville, Illinois, near O'Hare, they had a National Guard check point there.
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:54.200]  I'm going to church yesterday with my dad.
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:57.280]  I see National Guard Humvees all over interstate.
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:58.280]  Stay there.
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:19:59.280]  Stay there.
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:00.880]  Yes, it's happening with foreign drifts.
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:03.880]  You worry if you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:07.240]  Hi, summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:10.680]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember there's a
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:12.180]  learning curve.
[01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:14.240]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:17.720]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:19.520]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:22.320]  Her wild food knowledge package is the Crash Course.
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:26.000]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.480]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:34.620]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:39.240]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist
[01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:40.760]  in weeks, not years.
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:43.160]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:45.340]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:50.200]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51eatfree.
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:51.200]  Start now.

[01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:53.700]  Better take action.
[01:20:53.700 --> 01:21:01.700]  I think a storm's coming.
[01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:05.680]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:00.400]  Check them out today.
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:04.600]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:07.000]  to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:12.120]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many
[01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:15.120]  retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:19.440]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:23.360]  us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:27.120]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:28.480]  from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:32.520]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:33.520]  power.
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:37.400]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:38.960]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:43.680]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:48.520]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:51.600]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:01.840]  The problem.
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:04.200]  How do I cook food without power?
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:06.880]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:09.600]  How do I get emergency radio broadcast?
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:12.120]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:15.880]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:21.080]  to the radio, and producing clean water is the Family Emergency Kit from Kero Stove.

[01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:58.640]  Kero Stove for Family Emergency Solutions.
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:27.640]  Think about how we're calmly sitting here on the radio.
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:35.000]  With the Israeli, the European, the Iranian newspapers openly reporting that Israel and
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:42.400]  the United States are seriously publicly considering preemptive nuclear strikes on Iran.
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:50.400]  We're here calmly talking about the FCC itself putting out a proposal that they plan to implement
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:56.720]  next year to put a box by federal law in your house that your television and your Internet
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:04.640]  all wire through that tracks everywhere you visit and surveils you and blocks what you
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:06.600]  can visit.
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:10.840]  This is openly being announced with Lieberman saying, hey, what's wrong with this?
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:11.840]  China does it.
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:14.600]  That's a quote.
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:16.280]  What's wrong with this?
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:17.280]  China does it.
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:18.800]  See, that's called in your face.
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:22.120]  Oh, yes, we want to be like China.
[01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:24.680]  See, they're just bum rushing you.
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:27.120]  They're hitting all of us from so many angles.
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:28.480]  They hope that we just give up.
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:33.000]  And then I hear about a huge urban warfare drill with Homeland Security, local police,
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.400]  state police, Chicago police, and the National Guard.
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:43.440]  I send my guys up there and we get foreign troops from Poland and there were a bunch
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:45.560]  of drills of the guys couldn't even go to all of them.
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:50.600]  You know, they have to pick what they wanted to go to and they witnessed troops with police
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:54.880]  and foreign troops training to take over U.S. cities.
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:57.120]  Now, I don't just have that opinion.
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:03.720]  I have the last two governors and the Chicago mayor daily all the last year saying they
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:09.680]  want the National Guard to do door-to-door gun searches, knock-and-talks, to ask to come
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:12.400]  in and see your guns and if they're illegal, take them.
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:14.800]  No warrant, just door-to-door troops.
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:17.440]  And I'm getting video from Maryland.
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:19.160]  I'm getting video from Portland.
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:20.800]  I'm getting video from Dallas.
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:22.680]  I'm getting video from Detroit.
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:24.840]  I'm getting video from Illinois.
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:25.840]  And I'm getting news articles.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:30.160]  But you can just go to YouTube and type National Guard Runs Checkpoint.
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:36.720]  It's suddenly everywhere, everywhere, just troops, even in cornfields, out in the middle
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:42.700]  of nowhere, randomly asking to search people's cars or at a basketball game directing people
[01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:44.120]  into a high school basketball game.
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:51.240]  I saw that video out of Washington State two weeks ago.
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:55.840]  And then Julio calls from Illinois and says, yeah, this Sunday I'm driving around and I
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:58.640]  see National Guard at checkpoints.
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:02.000]  Folks, this is acclimation for total martial law.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.680]  This is martial law.
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:06.360]  Mexico's under martial law.
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:07.360]  They didn't declare it.
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:10.400]  They got troops on the streets.
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:13.280]  In the old Soviet Union, they had troops on the streets in Moscow.
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:15.240]  It was martial law.
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:18.960]  Martial law is troops stomping around with checkpoints.
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:20.720]  That is the bread and butter.
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:24.680]  That is the, if there's one definition, it's troops on the streets and warrantless wire
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:30.320]  tapping and surveillance and spies and secret arrest, everything we've got.
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:35.720]  BP thugs walking up and telling people, CBS, ABC, even national news, hey, you can't be
[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:37.240]  on this beach videotaping.
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:38.800]  Get out of here.
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:41.120]  That's martial law.
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:45.520]  Martial law is government seizing banks and taking your pension funds.
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:49.160]  Going back to Julio, then we'll go to Alan Lloyd and others.
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:50.400]  So Julio, take your time.
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:53.360]  Tell us where you were, what you saw, and please next time.
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:58.720]  There's no excuses with iPhones or go to a store by a $5 snapshot camera.
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:03.720]  Everyone must shoot the video of these National Guard checkpoints in Arizona, everywhere else,
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:07.000]  but not on the border, no, no, no, no, against the American people.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.240]  Julio, tell us what you saw.
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:12.120]  All right, this is all going back from last Monday till yesterday.
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:16.080]  I have an internship at a mockingbird news agency in Chicago.
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:21.240]  I'm not going to release the name for security purposes, but I'm on the metro train.
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:26.560]  I live in a suburb, and I see in a town called Bensonville, which is right near O'Hare,
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:31.760]  I see National Guardsmen in their full suits roaming around in the morning, what's going
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:32.760]  on.
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:37.960]  I get off in Chicago, and I see, it's supposedly what the Army's birthday last Monday.
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:41.880]  And there's vehicles all around downtown Chicago.
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:48.600]  I took a video, and I spoke with one of the guardsmen, I'll post that up online very shortly.
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:56.840]  And on Friday, I see training drills going on in Bensonville on the train.
[01:28:56.840 --> 01:29:02.640]  I come home Friday night at around 1 a.m., and I see a street sign that says, National
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:05.240]  Guard Training Exercise in Progress.
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:09.720]  And this is 1 a.m. Friday night or Saturday morning, I should say.
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:11.480]  And then yesterday, I'm going to church.
[01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:16.720]  That's why the Homeland Security loved having our guys there, and would always send them
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:22.240]  to videotape this or that, while the real drills were going on, all part of their deception.
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:23.920]  But tell us what else you saw.
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:27.440]  And then yesterday, I'm going to church with my dad for Father's Day.
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:32.240]  I'm on Interstate 90, and on the other side of the road, I nearly got into an accident
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:34.080]  because my mouth just dropped.
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:40.640]  I see around a line of 10 National Guard Humvees just driving around.
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:44.720]  Folks, we're in martial law, and I'm excited to hear what Rob do.
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:48.960]  I have to say with his reports, but they were practicing chemicals.
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:50.920]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:52.160]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:54.600]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.600 --> 01:30:01.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:03.320]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:07.680]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:08.680]  do you want?
[01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:10.680]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:15.720]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:16.960]  How much do you want?
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:17.960]  When do you want it?
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:19.960]  Now or after the battle starts.
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:21.080]  When will you need it?
[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:23.200]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:24.560]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:26.000]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.160]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:31.320]  and be immunized?
[01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:35.080]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:38.700]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:39.920]  How much will you need?
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:40.920]  We don't know.
[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:41.920]  How much do you want?
[01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:42.920]  All you can get.
[01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:43.920]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:51.600]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day, call 1-800-409-5633 or check it
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:33:21.360]  out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:49.440]  We are back live and I'm going to continue with your calls, but listen to Julio.
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:54.440]  He's telling you about military checkpoints that he saw in Chicago and surrounding areas
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:55.600]  and guess what?
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:59.400]  My guys happen to be there during part of this.
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:02.560]  So it's not just Julio calling in and telling me about this.
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:08.120]  I have news articles from Chicago and surrounding areas and I had two of my guys on the ground.
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:13.320]  They'll be on with us the last 30 minutes today and we're going to premiere on Prison
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:20.240]  Planet.tv while we simulcast with the radio show, video of foreign troops training to
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:23.400]  take on the American people.
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:29.560]  And I've been to these drills myself and when you see troops from 4, 5, 6, 7 in NLEO-9 last
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:35.640]  year, it was 14 different countries, openly training to take on and pull triggers on Americans,
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:36.960]  that's your wake-up call.
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:39.200]  No amount of propaganda works on you anymore.
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:43.760]  I mean, when you see them admitting it's for America.
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:47.640]  Now finishing up the point, you said that you almost ran off the road to see a whole
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:48.800]  bunch of Humvees.
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:49.800]  Finish your point, Julio.
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:56.320]  Yeah, there was just, you know, nonchalantly just driving around an interstate 90 near
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:57.320]  Chicago.
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:05.640]  I just saw a video right now on YouTube, Rob Dew is actually behind a woman from ABC7
[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:09.600]  in Oakland, Illinois, practicing a plane crash, Rob Dew is right behind this woman.
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:11.760]  I'll post this on your Facebook page.
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:18.200]  But you talk about their Polish troops there, I find it interesting because Blackwater has
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:25.320]  a training compound called Blackwater North located in a suburb near Rockford, Illinois.
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:30.920]  And folks, Alex, this is just frustrating, you know, because we have martial law here
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:35.360]  in Illinois all around the state and only thing people care about is the Blackhawks
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:36.920]  winning the Stanley Cup.
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:40.880]  And if LeBron James is ever going to come to the Bulls, I mean, or the World Cup and
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:46.800]  how we got robbed of our goals, we, our freedom, our, our future is at stake here and people
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:50.320]  only care about, you know, false, false gods.
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:54.040]  Well, that's why the globalists are going to create a complete depression and most
[01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:55.920]  of them will end up being homeless.
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:36:00.840]  And then they'll be in the homeless center watching LeBron James and they don't care.
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:03.000]  They don't care about their kids, nothing.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.980]  They have been turned into jellyfish, but it was 5% that won the war against the British
[01:36:07.980 --> 01:36:14.520]  Empire 230 years ago and it's going to be 5% that wins it again and we've got way more
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:15.960]  than 5% my friends.
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:20.600]  So chin up Julio, get those videos that you shot uploaded.
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:21.600]  God bless you.
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:22.600]  Great job.
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:25.160]  Send us the video if you want us to use it in a future film.
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:29.360]  All of you out there are intelligent sources and then we integrate it all together because
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:34.640]  we can't be everywhere, but you are everywhere and that's why we break so much incredible
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:35.640]  news here.
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:36.640]  It's because of you.
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:38.600]  You are the integral part of this broadcast.
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:43.080]  You are what makes it or breaks it, whether it's the activism, getting the word out, getting
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:46.440]  us the intel, you do it.
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:51.440]  And in Illinois, they admit they are acclimating the public for National Guard gun confiscation
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:52.440]  door to door.
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:54.240]  It's already been done in Illinois.
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:59.720]  National Guard in Treason, just like in New Orleans, they go knock on doors, they force
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:05.240]  their way in, same thing in Boston, same thing in other areas of the country, and the military
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:07.800]  comes in and takes the guns in America.
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:08.800]  This is being done.
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:10.040]  It's even in the news.
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:11.960]  They hide the treason in plain view.
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:12.960]  All right.
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:31.240]  I'm going to go back to your phone calls here in just a moment.
[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:32.240]  Thank you.
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:37.000]  I was looking for that.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.640]  I'm going to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio show
[01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:45.640]  possible, and then I'm going to continue with your phone calls here, those that are holding.
[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:56.040]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:05.000]  But before we continue here, we don't have to remind you that you need food to survive.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.840]  One of our biggest and longest sponsors, eFoodsDirect, is the longest continually operating storeable
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:11.400]  foods company in the country.
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:14.680]  They also happen to be true patriots and have supported the freedom movement for years and
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:15.680]  years.
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:20.520]  With the looming food shortages and the current economy, it is imperative that you make sure
[01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:25.920]  you and your family are prepared with non-GMO good, clean, storeable foods.
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:32.640]  Give them a call at 1-800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:35.080]  They will never stand in the bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:36.880]  I don't know who.
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:40.800]  With impending war with Iran and the economy falling apart, I mean, I hope we don't have
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:41.800]  war with Iran.
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:43.280]  I hope the depression stops.
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:44.600]  I hope it doesn't deepen.
[01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:48.360]  But more and more, it looks like it's a certainty instead of just a possibility.
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:53.520]  Why would anyone not have gold, guts, guns, and food?
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:57.640]  eFoodsDirect.com 800-409-5633.
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:04.280]  And also, when you talk about water, the Acola Blue is an awesome system that grabs water
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:07.320]  right out of the atmosphere, humidity out of the atmosphere.
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:09.520]  Their smallest unit does 7.5 gallons a day.
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:12.720]  They've got units that can support an army battalion, and they shipped quite a few of
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:18.400]  those for free out to Haiti.
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:20.800]  And it's the best, cleanest drinking water you can get.
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:24.920]  They send it through 7 to 12 filters depending on the unit, and then it's stored in a stainless
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:25.920]  steel tank.
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:28.360]  It looks like a water cooler without the water bottle on top.
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:29.520]  Their smaller unit does.
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:42.480]  AcolaBlue.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com, AcolaBlue.com, or 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043, AcolaBlue.com.
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:50.760]  And then lastly, your purchase of the books, of the videos, of the t-shirts, the ball caps,
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:55.680]  all the patriot material that we have at infowars.com.
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:59.520]  The online video bookstore makes this broadcast possible.
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:03.720]  So again, infowars.com, we have two different shopping carts to choose from.
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:16.080]  You can also call toll-free, 888-253-3139, that's 888-253-3139, or you can simply go and download
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:24.200]  all my films in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv and the archives audio in 64 kilobit, higher
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:29.280]  quality than the freestreams, the video archives that we simulcast with the show, and so much
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:31.160]  more at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:36.120]  And I'm starting to do special video reports just for prisonplanet.tv members weekly.
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:39.440]  Paul Watson did a 40-minute report over the weekend on the oil spill and the fact that
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:41.720]  it's a premeditated inside job.
[01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:44.040]  Steve Watson's about to start his weekly report.
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:49.280]  So is Kurt Nemo giving you more analysis, more angles, more information.
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:51.600]  And if you like our report and think it's informative, you can just burn it right to
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:56.520]  DivEx or other disc systems we have, we have those tools there on prisonplanet.tv and give
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:59.360]  it to your friends, family, neighbors, air it on access television.
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:02.880]  Again, it's all a community effort against the globalist.
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:07.600]  Prisonplanet.tv, it takes about a minute to sign up, create your username and password
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:11.400]  and you can share your username and password with up to six people.
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:15.480]  They can then be simultaneously logged on, downloading, and watching and using this key
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:17.520]  information in the info war.
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:18.520]  Prisonplanet.tv.
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:23.720]  I want to say great job to my entire crew that makes this possible and my IT folks and
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:27.320]  you who are prisonplanet.tv members who make it all possible.
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:29.880]  All right, Alan in Texas, let's move quick now.
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:30.880]  You're on the air.
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:31.880]  Go ahead, Alan.
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:32.880]  All right, Alex.
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:37.480]  You helped pull me out of the matrix about three months ago and so I'm fairly new at
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:41.880]  this, trying to figure out what these psychos are doing.
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:48.480]  And as I'm watching the oil spill and I understand, I believe 100% that it was
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:52.440]  a false flag and that it is distracting us from other things.
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:58.920]  But I'm also trying to decide and wonder, I'm looking to place where they drill bad
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:05.680]  a mile deep and one of the most highly pressurized wells in the world, apparently.
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:12.320]  I'm reading and watching videos from Matt Simmons who's talking about basically the
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:19.400]  pipe is gone and it's spilling underneath the surface of the earth and cracks.
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:23.120]  And the camera there showing us is not where the leak is.
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:24.120]  So that's the mouth.
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:28.680]  He said the tiger is six miles away where the oil plume is.
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:31.080]  And basically, we have a gaping hole.
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:32.080]  And these reliefs...
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:33.080]  No, that's right.
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:36.080]  That's why a nuke will only make it worse because it's already fractured.
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:39.880]  And so the billions of gallons of oil in that reservoir that it's estimated to be at two
[01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:45.360]  billion gallons or more is spilling into all these different strata and all the other areas
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:49.840]  where companies have drilled at different levels and drained those underground chambers.
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:52.600]  But that's actually at one way to look at it.
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:53.600]  We don't know yet.
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:57.440]  That could be goodness because a lot of the oil is just going to be contained under the
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:03.800]  ground and then only leak out in smaller areas instead of all of it being this gorged at
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:04.800]  one point.
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:09.360]  A lot of it may just get trapped at other levels under the ground because it's 30,000
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:12.440]  feet deep.
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:15.600]  But if they detonate a nuke, many experts believe it will just fracture the structure
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:22.040]  even more and open up a bunch of other underground oil mega chambers and gas chambers.
[01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:28.160]  And if they detonate a nuke, there's undoubtedly masses of natural gas and methane down there.
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:30.760]  And that could cause a chain reaction.
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:33.600]  That is serious and has to be looked at.
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:41.200]  I guess from my opinion, and knowing what I know from my three months is the end game
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:47.000]  from this is to basically wipe us off the face of the earth and institute Mars along
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:50.840]  so they can start doing the end game.
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:59.400]  Could this be a pretext for us, for them to actually start, if you have all these gases,
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:02.880]  the toxic chemicals they're dispersing, a hurricane comes through, could this be an
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:06.560]  excuse for them to actually, I know they're not doing it right now, but it seems like
[01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:08.800]  they have a lot of drills that are pointing that way.
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:13.000]  And I live on the gulf and my family is on the gulf, I'm trying to, you know, I understand,
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:17.240]  you know, World War III, but I have, you know, an 18-wheeler potentially right in my backyard
[01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:18.920]  right now that I have to deal with.
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:21.880]  And I'm trying to think, you know, is that a plausible...
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:24.640]  Well, you know, we know the globalist stage things.
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:29.320]  We know they also use existing crises and don't want to go to waste is the White House
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:34.080]  Chief of Staff has said I'm a manual, but there's no doubt they staged this event by
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:37.320]  giving orders they knew would cause it to blow up on record.
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:38.320]  And that's the bare minimum.
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:44.880]  They probably just blew it because there was a strange group on board the well two hours
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:51.880]  before that made an unscheduled, unauthorized change.
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:55.040]  And reportedly that's what made the engineers even more angry and they said, it's going
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:56.400]  to blow up, it's going to blow up.
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:59.760]  And there was basically almost a mutiny on board the well.
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:05.080]  Now the feds have clamped down on any info and on the people that were part of that Coast
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:07.080]  Guard inquiry.
[01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:12.400]  So that's why we need a criminal investigation, multiple criminal investigations by grand juries,
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:15.960]  by state legislatures, so that this cover up can't continue.
[01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:22.880]  BP and Obama are desperate to manage this information because they're culpable in it.
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:24.160]  And so there's no telling.
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:28.720]  But notice everything's coming together right now, the financial collapse, the Armada in
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:37.680]  the Gulf, openly threatening Iran, the oil well, the gas plume, the methane bubble, just
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:44.760]  I mean, I kept saying for the last two years, look for 2010, look for April for things to
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:45.760]  really kick off.
[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:49.360]  I said for three months before April, I said there will be a false flag in April.
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:53.440]  I don't know what it's going to be, but it's going to be used to bring in war, to bring
[01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:57.480]  in the carbon tax, to bring in their tyranny, all of their agenda is stalling, whatever
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:59.480]  it's going to be.
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:02.960]  And then suddenly they started hyping domestic groups are working with Al Qaeda, they're
[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:08.320]  going to get us, Iran's going to get us, bin Laden's back, he's in Iran, and you see all
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:13.800]  that propaganda, the MSNBC specials, the HBO specials attacking the Tea Parties saying
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:17.120]  we're terrorists, saying we're going to stage terror.
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:23.520]  So I think it's going to be a cocktail of staged events to so confuse people that they
[01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:25.120]  can bring in their world government.
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:28.600]  The good news is we're here speaking out, we're here fighting, and so they're moving
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:32.240]  with internet censorship, and that's coming up in the next hour with Max Kaiser.
[01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:33.240]  Thank you, Alan.
[01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:35.240]  Lloyd in Wisconsin, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:37.240]  Hi, how are you doing?
[01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:38.240]  Good, sir.
[01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:44.200]  I was listening to you show a couple of months ago, and I heard you say something about government
[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:50.520]  making new shots to try out on children, and two weeks ago I was actually getting a whole
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:55.680]  bunch of phone calls from a research center asking me if I would like my daughter to try
[01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:56.680]  them shots.
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:47:02.200]  Yeah, well that's, I mean it's kind of like when I'm standing on a fishing pier on Lake
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:11.400]  Travis and I throw a piece of blood bait out there and sink it to the bottom 50 feet down
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:14.960]  trying to catch a channel cat, which I did this weekend, caught several, actually my
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:17.600]  son did, so it's the same thing.
[01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:21.720]  They throw their fishing line out with a big piece of blood bait on it, and they say,
[01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:25.440]  do you want to protect your child, we've got an experimental meningitis shot, we've got
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:31.160]  an experimental HIV vaccine, we've got an experimental, you know, earache vaccine, we've
[01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:35.640]  got an experimental shot that your daughter will never want to use cocaine or heroin,
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:39.800]  we've got an experimental Gardasil shot, this is four years ago, and it killed a bunch of
[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:40.800]  people.
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:45.080]  So the government said great, it killed people, we're going to approve it, and then you sign
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:49.400]  waivers when you go bring your daughter in, a lot of times they'll even pay you and you
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:56.540]  take the bait and then they can skew the study and claim it's safe even if people die and
[01:47:56.540 --> 01:47:58.380]  bring it out on the market.
[01:47:58.380 --> 01:48:02.720]  But more what they do, the New York Daily News reported that they come to, in one case,
[01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:07.760]  a black woman, so they were targeting the black community, this was five years ago,
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:12.920]  and they say, CPS will either take your eight-year-old for medical experiments, or we're going
[01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:15.160]  to take your two-year-old as well.
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:19.560]  And so they corner the mother, there's no man there to protect her, she doesn't have
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:22.800]  money to run, doesn't know how to run, hadn't been taught to run, the people been taught
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:27.160]  to go into a catatonic fetal position when a government bureaucrat shows up and just do
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:31.200]  whatever they say to the television teachers and that, and they took, in this one case,
[01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:36.000]  the eight-year-old, and they took him and they tested pesticide on him till he died.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:39.880]  And he tried to run, he tried to fight, they strapped him down and then took several months,
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:40.880]  they murdered him.
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:44.680]  And of course, that was in the New York Daily News, and it turned out that CPS workers finally
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:48.200]  blew the whistle, they could even recognize their evil, and they said that they had taken
[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:52.160]  thousands of predominantly black children, and they took them to private research facilities
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:57.960]  to test vaccines and pesticides on them, and they just murdered them, just like they take
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:03.000]  our organs here in the U.S. in hospitals, you know, you come in, you've been knocked
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:06.520]  out by a car wreck, but you've got good brainwaves, and they just quietly kill you.
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:10.840]  It's not all hospitals, but they do have these eugenicist murderers in the facilities, and
[01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:14.720]  they get a big piece of the kickback, and they just murder you for your organs.
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:18.040]  And the average American just can't face it, so it's going to continue.
[01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:21.120]  The average American can't face, they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines and sodium
[01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:25.640]  fluoride in the water, Lloyd, and so it's going to continue.
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:30.360]  It's called murder, death, kill, and, you know, it's blown my psyche, it's blown my
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:35.560]  mind, facing the facts, but other people just won't face it, so they're going to get hurt
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:36.560]  real bad.
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:37.560]  Anything else, Lloyd?
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:41.600]  This company even told me that they'd pay for it, they'd pay for it, they'd fly us down
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:44.960]  to where they are, and last year, my daughter's too.
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:49.720]  Well, I mean, I mean, look, I mean, I go to the beach to catch sharks, you know, and so
[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:53.280]  it's the same thing, they'll bring you to them, they're hunting you.
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:54.280]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:58.800]  My daughter, my first year, my daughter was born, and they had flu shots, we got her the
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:01.160]  flu shot because she was so young.
[01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:05.760]  She got so sick that year, we had to take her to the doctor so many times, well, with
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:11.000]  this past fall, we were like, let's not get the flu shot, she didn't get sick once.
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.480]  No, well, that's good news.
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:18.480]  And remember, you could get a natural disease, people could get sick, and vaccines could
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:21.440]  be helpful in the science shows, could actually work.
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:28.560]  The problem is over 90%, according to the Associated Press and the FDA, of vaccines
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:33.800]  are now made in China, they're totally full of garbage, and the UN's been caught with
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:39.720]  contracts in India, Africa and China and Europe, in tetanus shots alone, having an expensive
[01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:46.560]  female hormone added to then cause an autoimmune response to that hormone to cause sterilization.
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:53.240]  You cannot trust these people to do anything, they're openly eugenicist and want you dead.
[01:50:53.240 --> 01:50:58.240]  So God bless you for waking up, Lloyd, Bob, Steve, Bob, Sean and others, straight ahead,
[01:50:58.240 --> 01:50:59.240]  stay with us.
[01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:04.980]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[01:51:04.980 --> 01:51:07.880]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:11.920]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:12.920]  or gold?
[01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:16.320]  It's true, seeds and all perform even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:18.480]  possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:23.000]  So our friends at Solutions from Science, have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.000]  seeds.

[01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:38.640]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:08.720]  My name is Van, and I'm 68 years old, and I live in Vermont.
[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:13.440]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:17.160]  It felt like my heart was pounding, made me feel breathless.
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:21.840]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:22.840]  Nothing did anything.
[01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:26.800]  Heart and body extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:30.680]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered heart and body extract.
[01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:32.960]  I noticed a difference quickly.
[01:53:32.960 --> 01:53:38.920]  Within days, the episodes became less frequent, and by a month I completely vanished.

[01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:28.360]  body extract.
[01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:31.680]  The United Nations has been caught, vaccine makers have been caught.
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:37.120]  I told you three months before the flu outbreak started in April that they were going to stage
[01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:45.720]  a flu outbreak, and we even fingered H1N1, because it's just like we knew they were
[01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:49.320]  about to stage an attack before 9-11 and say that bin Laden had done it, because they were
[01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:55.040]  on the news demonizing al-Qaeda and massing U.S. troops in and around Afghanistan.
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:58.520]  But that was quietly only in the foreign news.
[01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:01.560]  They were massing their armies.
[01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:05.040]  It's like Poland knew when Germany was going to attack them months before, because the
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:08.200]  Germans started massing forces.
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:10.440]  I could see them getting ready with the flu.
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:12.240]  I could see them getting ready with 9-11.
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:16.760]  I could see them getting ready for an attack on Iran, and now they admit, yes, we're getting
[01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:18.120]  ready to attack Iran.
[01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:24.040]  Yes, we're going to start with a blockade and start boarding their ships all over the
[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:29.480]  Persian Gulf and other seas.
[01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:34.240]  And Iran says that's an act of war, which it is under all common law, all international
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:39.120]  law, under U.S. law, Iranian law, it is illegal.
[01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:40.560]  They say nothing's going to go into Iran.
[01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:48.280]  They are going to literally have that country under siege, and I just can't believe this
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:49.840]  is all happening.
[01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:54.800]  And like the callers said, the general public is still worried about LeBron James.
[01:55:54.800 --> 01:56:00.320]  You can get 4,000 people, reportedly, to a fan appreciation thing to beg him to not
[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:03.640]  leave Cleveland, and then he didn't even show up, so people were panicking.
[01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:06.800]  The team was calling him, so he showed up 10 minutes before.
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:08.280]  The end.
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:10.960]  And these people are just pathetic.
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:17.120]  I mean, America is going down the toilet, and the average American won't get upset and
[01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:22.800]  fight and even speak out for liberty, but they'll go turn over cars and yell and scream
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:28.640]  in mindless, violent victory and triumph over a stupid Lakers game.
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:30.120]  This is mind control.
[01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:34.800]  This is mental illness.
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:36.120]  This is disgusting.
[01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:37.800]  Let's go back to your calls.
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:39.400]  Let's talk to Bob in Ohio.
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:40.800]  Bob, you're on the air.
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:43.840]  Hey, it's an honor, Alex.
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:45.120]  Happy Father's Day.
[01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:47.040]  You're a warrior among warriors.
[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:49.640]  I do have some things to share with the American people.
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:54.360]  I'm a two-tour non-vet Navy, and I've been watching a long time.
[01:56:54.360 --> 01:57:00.680]  I need to implore the people out there, whatever age you are, whether you're high school, whether
[01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:09.680]  you're in the military, whether you're a policeman, whether you're a fireman, whether
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:14.960]  you're in college, we need you people, and you're going to have to let your petty
[01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:21.280]  differences aside, white, black, Hispanic, Oriental, you're going to have to put some
[01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:23.680]  petty differences aside, okay?
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:28.040]  I will give you a sword to wound the new world order.
[01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:35.560]  You're exactly on mark, and people ought to be buying E. Colen evaporators and solar
[01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:36.560]  generation.
[01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:38.680]  You're saying, getting prepared, but I mean, give us your...
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:39.680]  Be prepared.
[01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:40.680]  Yeah.
[01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:43.120]  But I want to share something with you, folks.
[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:46.400]  July 4th is coming up, Independence Day.
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:53.680]  If you people love God, wherever you're at, and your knowledge of who He is, if you love
[01:57:53.680 --> 01:58:01.160]  peace, we are men of peace, and we make war against those that love death.
[01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:07.000]  You're going to have to lay your differences aside and rally to death together, and what
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:15.360]  you need to do is protest, vehemently protest and demonstrate at the Pentagon, at the United
[01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:23.720]  Nations, at the Attorney General's office, and at Congress to stop this war and this
[01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:27.520]  insanity over in the Middle East and gone against Iran.
[01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:28.520]  Stay there.
[01:58:28.520 --> 01:58:29.520]  I totally agree with you.
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:30.520]  That's my point.
[01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:34.640]  They've had a protest here in Austin with maybe 20 people against the Iran strike, and
[01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:36.000]  God bless that 20.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.800]  We need 4,000.
[01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:41.160]  This is more important than LeBron James.
[01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:44.000]  How do you spell hard-hitting talk radio?
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:50.360]  G-C-N, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:54.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:55.000]  generator.
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:59.360]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.360 --> 01:59:03.680]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:59:03.680 --> 01:59:05.000]  allows you to have.
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:06.000]  That's true.
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:10.700]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:10.700 --> 01:59:15.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:19.040]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:22.520]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:26.240]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:31.000]  Number five, a solar-powered generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:34.760]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:36.120]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:40.360]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:41.960]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:41.960 --> 02:00:05.440]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:00:05.440 --> 02:00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want answers?
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:13.520]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:22.520]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.520 --> 02:00:29.640]  Bob, Steve, Rob, Sean, Shane, others, we're going to get to your calls coming up the next
[02:00:29.640 --> 02:00:30.640]  hour.
[02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:33.640]  Max Kaiser is going to be riding shotgun weather, so always informative.
[02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:39.040]  Talk about the BP oil spill, the economy, open the calls to censor the Internet.
[02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:42.120]  I can't believe how bold this FCC plan is.
[02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:47.440]  I was even blindsided by this, but going back to your calls before we go to break and then
[02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:51.560]  come back with Max Kaiser, and we'll start simulcasting the last two hours, the balance
[02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:56.600]  of it, at prisonplanet.tv for viewers who want to have an added dimension to the radio,
[02:00:56.600 --> 02:01:00.120]  be able to see the television segment of the transmission.
[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:05.920]  But Bob just called in, and he was pointing out, as a Vietnam vet, we had better protest
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:12.880]  at the UN, the Pentagon, our state capitals, everywhere, now, against an attack on Iran.
[02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:17.280]  And notice the media says, Al Qaeda's about to hit us, they're about to nuke us, bin Laden's
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:22.720]  in Iran, we got to go in, Iran's got nukes, and Israel may have to nuke them, Israel may
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:27.080]  have to nuke them, and they've got all these martial law drills going on around the country.
[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:32.040]  I mean, you can really see the gear up for this, and they're using the BP oil spill
[02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:35.520]  to pass their carbon tax, but also as an overall distraction.
[02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:36.520]  Anything else, Bob?
[02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:38.360]  Well, yeah.
[02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:44.480]  Like I said before, lay your petty differences aside, please, and don't wait until November.
[02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:49.960]  We have to push the New World Order back because they're getting ready to pull their deals,
[02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:50.960]  okay?
[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:52.800]  I can't emphasize that enough.
[02:01:52.800 --> 02:02:00.080]  We need to start demonstrating in mass and protesting this mid-east conquering deal,
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:04.400]  and that will show the Muslim people and the mid-east people, and the Russians and the
[02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:07.920]  Chinese that they haven't taken America yet.
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:09.400]  We're not dead yet, brother.
[02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:13.920]  We've been kicked hard, and we've been knocked down, but we've got to get up and stand.
[02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:18.000]  If you're unemployed, get up there and do something for your country.
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:21.760]  And listen, even if you're by yourself doing it at the city council or going and speaking
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:26.840]  at the city council, every person's voice being heard gives others out there who think
[02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:29.320]  they're alone the courage to stand up and take action.
[02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:30.840]  I appreciate your call.
[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:37.560]  One of the biggest illusions the globalists have is that we're all alone, that we're not
[02:02:37.560 --> 02:02:38.560]  the majority.
[02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:39.560]  We are the majority.
[02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:44.520]  That's why the media, the Republicans and Democrats, Fox News and CNN, MSNBC, skillfully,
[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:49.720]  remember a year and a half ago, Republican and Democratic leaders were getting booed
[02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:54.120]  off stages everywhere here in Texas, Rick Perry be booed off the stage, Senator Cornyn
[02:02:54.120 --> 02:03:01.400]  be booed off, then suddenly Democrats were being booed, Arlen Specter, Lloyd Doggett,
[02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:05.200]  and the media said, these are Republican operatives, and I went on there and said, no, it's both
[02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:06.200]  parties.
[02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:10.520]  And then the media said, oh, it's a Republican against Democrat thing to make it a self-fulfilling
[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:11.520]  prophecy.
[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:15.880]  Now Democrats and liberals think, oh, well, I can't protest against the war.
[02:03:15.880 --> 02:03:17.720]  I can't protest against torture.
[02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:23.880]  I can't protest against the Panker bailout because all protest is only the Tea Party.
[02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:31.040]  So they branded as a Republican thing when it's not even that, to try to limit demonstrations
[02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:32.840]  and protest.
[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:37.500]  Also the big tax-free foundations, Ford Foundation, Carnegie and others, have been caught for
[02:03:37.500 --> 02:03:43.600]  decades running the peace activists organizations, financing the reverent rights, so that there's
[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:45.280]  never a real anti-war movement.
[02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:47.880]  I mean, you notice, you never hear any anti-war talk.
[02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:53.000]  Now, Obama's expanded Afghanistan, gone into Pakistan, we're still in Iraq.
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:56.360]  He always keeps pushing it off another six months, another year.
[02:03:56.360 --> 02:03:59.640]  You notice that the torture's continuing, the secret arrest is expanding, now they
[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:01.480]  want it for U.S. citizens.
[02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:07.000]  Take him away into a black hole, the essential bedrock of tyranny, the end of habeas corpus.
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:08.600]  Where are all the trendy liberals?
[02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:10.120]  Well, they were just trendy.
[02:04:10.120 --> 02:04:15.880]  The media made it cool, and Chris Matthews and Oberyn made it cool to Bash Bush.
[02:04:15.880 --> 02:04:20.600]  But now that it's Obama, well, they're just going to sit down and shut up and let World
[02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:22.000]  War III happen.
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:23.000]  Shame on you.
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:27.260]  And all of you sickening, mainline Republican Tea Party people, shame on you.
[02:04:27.260 --> 02:04:30.920]  You claim you're patriots, but you want to attack Iran because it's some subconscious
[02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:38.800]  level that makes you feel manly to talk about nuking people and parking lots.
[02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:42.080]  You watch, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:42.080 --> 02:04:43.080]  They hit Iran.
[02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:45.600]  It's the beginning of the end.
[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:47.840]  This is the beginning of World War III.
[02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:51.040]  The vast majority of analysts believe it will lead to World War III.
[02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:56.320]  The minorities say it'll lead to terror attacks, a regional war, and gas prices doubling or
[02:04:56.320 --> 02:04:58.760]  tripling, and total police state here at home.
[02:04:58.760 --> 02:05:00.280]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:01.280]  Hello, friends.
[02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:02.280]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:05.600]  You've heard me talk about Kalben five-star subs for years.
[02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:09.880]  This is an American-made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find
[02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:10.880]  in stores.
[02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:14.080]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.

[02:05:20.800 --> 02:05:21.800]  Take my word for it.
[02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:24.560]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:29.560]  Since 1947, Kalben Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and
[02:05:29.560 --> 02:05:31.000]  gentle on the environment.
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:36.040]  Buy American and stay clean, as well as support InfoWars, visit 5starsoap.com today or call

[02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:41.040]  Well, Marty, what do you have to say?
[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:48.680]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, satisfaction is guaranteed on W. Dirtback.
[02:05:48.680 --> 02:05:58.760]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 for a free catalog or visit our website 5starsoap.com.
[02:05:58.760 --> 02:06:00.260]  Thank you.
[02:06:00.260 --> 02:06:02.640]  They help to create a new world order.
[02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:04.880]  We are part of a new world order.
[02:06:04.880 --> 02:06:08.120]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[02:06:08.120 --> 02:06:12.280]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:13.280]  documents.
[02:06:13.280 --> 02:06:17.760]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:20.240]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:23.000]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.920]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[02:06:25.920 --> 02:06:31.240]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[02:06:31.240 --> 02:06:33.760]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:38.240]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[02:06:38.240 --> 02:06:39.240]  financial system.
[02:06:39.240 --> 02:06:42.120]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:45.840]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:46.960]  And I got news for you.
[02:06:46.960 --> 02:06:48.640]  You're everyone else.
[02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:49.640]  Invisible Empire.

[02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:03.800]  Hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:03.800 --> 02:07:08.160]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:09.160]  do you want?
[02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:11.160]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.160 --> 02:07:16.200]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.200 --> 02:07:17.440]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:18.440]  When do you want it?
[02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:20.440]  Now or after the battle starts.
[02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:21.580]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.580 --> 02:07:23.680]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:25.040]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.040 --> 02:07:26.520]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:30.640]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:31.800]  and be immunized?
[02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:35.600]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.600 --> 02:07:39.200]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:40.440]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:41.440]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:42.440]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:43.440]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:44.440]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:47.480]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:47.480 --> 02:07:54.920]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:07:54.920 --> 02:08:01.920]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:10.920]  He's the T-Rex of Political Talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:10.920 --> 02:08:20.920]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're now simulcasting the second half of this Monday,
[02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:27.920]  June 21, 2010, Radio Transmission at PrisonPlanet.tv, so if you want to see us in living color,
[02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:30.920]  not just hear us on the radio, go over to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:30.920 --> 02:08:36.200]  Of course, the other websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:41.280]  Rahm Emanuel expected to quit White House, stepping down as corruption scandals intensify
[02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:49.480]  surrounding him like BP paying for his million-dollar-a-year apartment for many, many years, or million-dollar
[02:08:49.480 --> 02:08:50.480]  apartment.
[02:08:50.480 --> 02:08:56.520]  U.S.-Israeli warships in Suez may be prelude to face-off with Iran.
[02:08:56.520 --> 02:09:03.320]  This out of the Israeli national news, Arutz Shaveev, or Shiva, continuing, that's also
[02:09:03.320 --> 02:09:07.360]  in herettes, as well as her Jerusalem Post, are reporting on the same development.
[02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:13.520]  Armada of U.S. and Israeli warships head for Iran, or the 12 U.S. and Israeli warships,
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:18.480]  including a aircraft carrier, pass through the Suez Canal last Friday and are headed
[02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:20.840]  for the Red Sea, according to eyewitnesses.
[02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:24.920]  The U.S. battleships were the largest to have crossed the canal in many years, reported
[02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:27.080]  the London-based newspaper.
[02:09:27.080 --> 02:09:30.760]  The Israeli newspaper, herettes, reported Egyptian opposition members criticized the
[02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:34.160]  government for cooperating with the United States and Israeli forces and allowing the
[02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:37.320]  passage of the ships through the Egyptian territorial waters.
[02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:41.600]  The Red Sea is the most direct route to the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean.
[02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:49.520]  Meanwhile, we have an infowars.com article that quotes FAR's news agency and Press TV.
[02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:54.280]  Iran threatens to stop Western ships if subjected to cargo inspection.
[02:09:54.280 --> 02:10:01.000]  We warn the U.S. in certain adventurous countries that they are tempted to inspect Iranian air
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:02.440]  and ship cargos.
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:08.160]  We will take tough action against their ships in the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman, said
[02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:13.600]  the Iranian parliament speaker, and it continues, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:18.880]  So we'll be discussing that with Max Kaiser.
[02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:24.840]  Also, we've got an article up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com that I'm asking listeners
[02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:28.720]  to take action on today.
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:33.160]  Instead of letting Bobby Jendal complain and Hailey Barber complain of Mississippi, instead
[02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:40.320]  of just letting the governor of Florida complain about the feds blocking now for 60-plus days,
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:45.640]  relief barges, foreign countries, the Dutch, the Norwegians, and others, and the Coast
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:50.760]  Guard going out and blocking state vessels from even putting up berms in front of estuaries,
[02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:54.200]  we need to have the states declare 9th and 10th Amendment powers and go out and just
[02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:58.840]  push the Coast Guard aside, say, look, you're engaged in treason, you don't have jurisdiction.
[02:10:58.840 --> 02:11:03.720]  For 10 miles into the estuaries and the wetlands, the Coast Guard says they now control the state
[02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:08.440]  land and aren't letting people fish, they aren't letting them remove oil because you've
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:12.800]  got to have a permit to basically wipe your nose in this country because the fed mafia
[02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:17.200]  has to control everything and contracts to clean it up can only be given to White House
[02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:21.200]  cronies like Haliburton and others.
[02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:23.320]  But that's a side issue.
[02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:27.480]  We know now from the Coast Guard hearings, with the survivors of the rigs and the head
[02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:32.840]  engineers, not just with BP but Haliburton and the other companies that were out there,
[02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:37.080]  there were upwards of five companies working as contractors on the rig that they told two
[02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:41.960]  months before, a month before, two weeks before, a week before, a few days before, and hours
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:47.360]  before, that's BBC Associated Press, we have them all listed on my websites, that it was
[02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:52.560]  going to blow up, the well was going to come in and ignite, it was full of methane gas and
[02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:58.400]  other variants of natural gas, that they were dumping seawater into the 30,000 foot hole,
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:03.040]  never before done to supposedly pressurize it, seawater weighs what, you know, nine
[02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:09.840]  pounds of gallons at a 15, 16, 17 for the mud or concrete that they inject in, and I've
[02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:12.760]  gone and researched the engineering on this.
[02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:17.600]  The engineers said this will blow up but BP said go ahead and do it.
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:22.600]  That's because they are the key globalists funding the carbon tax, their whole carbon
[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:27.760]  tax is in trouble and there is no doubt this is a strategic attack to bring that carbon
[02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:28.760]  tax in.
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:32.960]  Now, we'll see if Max Kaiser agrees with us, he of course brought out the fact that Goldman
[02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:36.560]  Sachs and others engaged a few months ago in financial terrorism with that thousand
[02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:42.160]  point ten minute drop, later it came out that indeed they were in there manipulating, but
[02:12:42.160 --> 02:12:47.880]  I haven't asked Max his view on this, we'll see what he thinks about the BP slash Obama
[02:12:47.880 --> 02:12:51.560]  situation and where this is going, then we're going to talk to Max about the Iran situation
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:56.400]  and other things that the BP disaster is a distraction for, and then we'll talk about
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:12:59.520]  something that even bold me over.
[02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:04.000]  The FCC had said they wanted to regulate the internet and tax it and tax alternative news
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:10.320]  to fund a quote government megaphone, government media, and to fund old line media that's dying.
[02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:14.280]  That had been in the old proposal, they came out Friday, it's in the AP financial times
[02:13:14.280 --> 02:13:18.840]  of London, they have links to the FCC proposal, which is what they want to implement, a black
[02:13:18.840 --> 02:13:23.960]  box in your house that watches everything you do on TV and internet, all wired through
[02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:30.280]  it, whether it's cable, satellite, doesn't matter, and it surveils you and it blocks
[02:13:30.280 --> 02:13:35.440]  what you can get, and then it takes over the ISPs, we already knew about that, with cyber
[02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:41.000]  security where all ISPs, with 100 or more customers, that's all ISPs out there, internet
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:45.360]  service providers, everything must be wired through on their end in government equipment.
[02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:51.240]  I work in radio, in 96 under the telecommunications act, they said that old radio and TV stations,
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:56.480]  the final piece of equipment at the transmitter, and I know engineers hate them because they
[02:13:56.480 --> 02:14:02.200]  add noise into the chain on radio and TV, because you've got to put this federal piece
[02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:07.760]  that shortwave radio controlled where they can dial in and take over and just put a red
[02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:13.520]  screen up via computer command on TV and have shortwave broadcast with government announcements
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:14.520]  on it.
[02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:20.640]  But I digress, all ISPs, you're home, everything will have this control box, let's now go
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:28.960]  to Max Kaiser of the Kaiser Report, he has a program on Russia Today, BBC, press TV, radio
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:33.560]  in London, and this guy is everywhere, needs no introduction here with us, and he'll be
[02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:37.400]  with us a little bit into the next hour, Max Kaiser, great to have you here with us.
[02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:39.800]  Alex Jones, good to be back.
[02:14:39.800 --> 02:14:43.040]  Well, you just heard that rant, what's your take on it?
[02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:51.240]  Well, the follow-up on what we talked about, back on the 1000 point crash on May 6th, on
[02:14:51.240 --> 02:14:55.000]  your show we talked about in terms of being a domestic financial terrorist attack.
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:01.000]  Now, since that time, just on June 17th, I'm reading a report here, there was another of
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:07.800]  these attacks, the Washington Post stock doubled in five minutes, and this was yet another
[02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:14.320]  one of these attacks by program traders and high-frequency traders on Wall Street that
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:18.960]  are using their technology to manipulate markets.
[02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:23.560]  And so now, as I predicted, you would see more of these attacks, and going forward you
[02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:29.960]  will see many, many more of these types of events where prices are skyrocketing or plummeting
[02:15:29.960 --> 02:15:35.540]  in two or three minutes as the people who run the computer programs are booking enormous
[02:15:35.540 --> 02:15:42.320]  profits and holding the entire system hostage.
[02:15:42.320 --> 02:15:43.800]  Well continue, Max.
[02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:48.240]  Well, so that trend is firmly in place.
[02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:56.640]  We definitely have now the, aware with all the ability to put in these enormous market
[02:15:56.640 --> 02:16:03.960]  moving program trades that nobody is doing anything to really stop, and they put lots
[02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:08.720]  of money into the pockets of the same people who are financing all the elections and putting
[02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:14.320]  in the folks in Washington that we are further deregulating these markets.
[02:16:14.320 --> 02:16:22.160]  Now, to move over to the BP situation, you know, this is remarkably the Wall Street Journal.
[02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:24.320]  I think this is important to get into the thinking here.
[02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:30.360]  The Wall Street Journal, on June 15th, their take on it, check this out, they said, the
[02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:34.640]  oil spill may end up lifting the GDP slightly.
[02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:41.320]  If you look at, it's not a catastrophe, it's actually an economic benefit for the people
[02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:43.120]  of the region and for the country.
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:48.080]  It's command destruction, just like we're in depression, but the top six bank stocks
[02:16:48.080 --> 02:16:50.320]  are up, so they tell us the economy's good.
[02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:54.600]  Right, according to J.P. Morgan Chase, the continuing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico
[02:16:54.600 --> 02:17:01.560]  should end up adding growth to the U.S. economy as a huge cleanup effort, are going to outweigh
[02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:09.080]  the negative factors, like the one million permanent job loss, the eco-terrorist catastrophe,
[02:17:09.080 --> 02:17:15.920]  the loss of that entire region, and the dead zone that will result as a result of this.
[02:17:15.920 --> 02:17:19.040]  So this is the type of thinking that we're battling.
[02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:24.200]  It's perpetrated by the Wall Street Journal, this idea that everything adds to GDP growth,
[02:17:24.200 --> 02:17:30.480]  like an ecological disaster, like a war in Iraq, a war in Iraq, all the trillion-dollar
[02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:35.000]  defense budget, it all ends up adding to the GDP, and we should be celebrating it.
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:40.440]  But the fact that it's ruining the economy and causing massive unemployment and massive
[02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:42.440]  social unrest, that's not a problem.
[02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:46.800]  As a matter of fact, the social unrest is going to equal more GDP growth as well, because
[02:17:46.800 --> 02:17:51.240]  after all, a lot of people are going to be out there buying placards, protesting the
[02:17:51.240 --> 02:17:56.440]  government, and probably buying little drums to beat, and little drum circles as they
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:17:57.440]  realize the problem.
[02:17:57.440 --> 02:18:01.400]  But Max, what about my idea to have people lobby for grand jury investigations at the
[02:18:01.400 --> 02:18:05.160]  state level, because we know the feds are bought and paid for by BP and Goldman Sachs
[02:18:05.160 --> 02:18:09.760]  that, of course, owns a lot of BP and formerly chaired it just a few months ago, the head
[02:18:09.760 --> 02:18:12.720]  of Goldman Sachs also co-chaired BP, as you know.
[02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:15.160]  Some of the public may not be aware of that, so I throw that in.
[02:18:15.160 --> 02:18:20.280]  I mean, what about criminal negligence, because we know now, according to the Coast Guard
[02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:24.720]  hearings with the survivors and the head engineers, that BP ordered them to do things
[02:18:24.720 --> 02:18:29.240]  that had never been done before, and that they said this is going to blow up, and BP
[02:18:29.240 --> 02:18:32.920]  said we don't care, do it, and this went on for two months.
[02:18:32.920 --> 02:18:35.880]  They kept saying it's going to blow up, it's going to blow up.
[02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:39.480]  Don't we need a criminal investigation to find out exactly what happened here?
[02:18:39.480 --> 02:18:45.360]  Well, I don't have any faith in the political process whatsoever, and on economics, here's
[02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:47.760]  where the math gets really dodgy.
[02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:51.880]  In other words, the government says that we're going to find BP $20 billion.
[02:18:51.880 --> 02:18:56.600]  Now what BP did the next day is they announced that Goldman Sachs is going to raise $20 billion
[02:18:56.600 --> 02:18:57.600]  new dollars for them.
[02:18:57.600 --> 02:19:01.880]  They're going to sell $20 to $50 billion in new bonds, thanks to Goldman Sachs and Wall
[02:19:01.880 --> 02:19:02.880]  Street bankers.
[02:19:02.880 --> 02:19:07.120]  So they're going to totally pay for this by borrowing money, which when the bets go
[02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:12.920]  bad, when they try to hedge those new offerings, of course, that'll end up being another bailout.
[02:19:12.920 --> 02:19:15.120]  So the U.S. public is going to be bailing out them too.
[02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:20.120]  Yeah, they're going to make money on the way up, investing it in a new derivative, and
[02:19:20.120 --> 02:19:24.240]  then when it bank rubs, the feds will come in and pay $50 billion, $100 billion, who knows
[02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:27.720]  what it'll be by then, into this new made-off-type scheme.
[02:19:27.720 --> 02:19:32.320]  Right, so you get $20 billion of new bonds that'll just go a channel into the damage
[02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:36.880]  fund, but of course, to pave the interest on that, BP will actually lower their operating
[02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:41.160]  standards and the risk of another event just like this actually went up because there's
[02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:42.160]  no punitive damage.
[02:19:42.160 --> 02:19:45.720]  All they're doing is they're trying to make it into a slap on the wrist, which they won't
[02:19:45.720 --> 02:19:46.720]  even pay.
[02:19:46.720 --> 02:19:49.480]  They'll get someone else to pay for it on Wall Street, but to pay the interest, they're
[02:19:49.480 --> 02:19:52.480]  going to lower their operating standards and increase the risk of another event like
[02:19:52.480 --> 02:19:53.480]  this happening again.
[02:19:53.480 --> 02:19:58.680]  Once Kaiser stayed there, we're going to come back and get into Internet censorship and
[02:19:58.680 --> 02:20:03.480]  phone calls, stay with us.
[02:20:03.480 --> 02:20:04.480]  This is not a drill.
[02:20:04.480 --> 02:20:05.480]  Repeat.
[02:20:05.480 --> 02:20:07.160]  This is not a drill.
[02:20:07.160 --> 02:20:09.080]  Gun cells are on a staggering pace.
[02:20:09.080 --> 02:20:12.880]  Gun prices are going through the roof, and that means desperate, vicious criminals now
[02:20:12.880 --> 02:20:16.200]  want your guns and will do anything to get them.

[02:24:11.320 --> 02:24:18.280]  and the rest of it, Max Kaiser is now joining the GCN radio network with a multi-hour program
[02:24:18.280 --> 02:24:21.960]  Saturday mornings at 9 a.m.
[02:24:21.960 --> 02:24:26.160]  It's the truth about markets, USA, Saturday, 9 a.m. central.
[02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:30.640]  Max, this is a short segment, but just give me your bottom line.
[02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:37.160]  In your gut, you've got Goldman Sachs dumping 44% of its stock the week before, and of course
[02:24:37.160 --> 02:24:41.920]  we know that they were at the time their chairman was also the chairman of BP, and then they
[02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:43.560]  made the shuffle right before.
[02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:49.320]  They dumped 44% of their BP stock when other oil stocks were way up.
[02:24:49.320 --> 02:24:52.880]  They also have the CEO dumping over a third of his stock the week before.
[02:24:52.880 --> 02:25:00.280]  We have Halliburton buying this cleanup company that is focused on the Gulf of Mexico in the
[02:25:00.280 --> 02:25:02.000]  weeks before.
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.560]  You have the fact that Obama now has called for the carbon tax.
[02:25:04.560 --> 02:25:07.120]  This is a nice political diversion.
[02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:11.120]  We know that BP ordered them to do things that they never done before, that they knew
[02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:12.120]  would blow up.
[02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:16.280]  You never let a good crisis go to waste.
[02:25:16.280 --> 02:25:22.520]  Anyway, I look at this, this is an inside job, Max Keiser, to get the new global carbon
[02:25:22.520 --> 02:25:25.360]  tax to prop up the new SDR system.
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:32.640]  Well, on the trading of BP stock, as you know, I've worked at Wall Street for many years.
[02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:38.240]  I know many, it's not all of the tricks that brokers and bankers can play.
[02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:44.120]  It's not difficult to pre-date or post-date a trade.
[02:25:44.120 --> 02:25:49.080]  In other words, they say that they sold their stock before the event.
[02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:54.680]  It's not difficult to actually sell the stock after the event and then to monkey around
[02:25:54.680 --> 02:26:01.520]  with the reporting and with the compliance and to basically commit a bit of accounting
[02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:03.320]  fraud.
[02:26:03.320 --> 02:26:10.480]  That was my first thought that the dates that they give for their sales were probably cooked
[02:26:10.480 --> 02:26:15.920]  to because they figured that they can do it, there's nobody pushing back on the regulatory
[02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:20.960]  front and fraud is the core business model of Wall Street.
[02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:28.800]  But beyond that, let's say that they had a pre-knowledge and they were dumping their
[02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:34.280]  shares ahead of this, the allot of the intelligence that flows into the trading desks and the hedge
[02:26:34.280 --> 02:26:40.120]  funds on Wall Street comes from sources that are not publicly available.
[02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:42.920]  That's why the system is horribly out of whack.
[02:26:42.920 --> 02:26:49.480]  The entire NSA CIA has admitted not just spying on us but getting intel and economic information
[02:26:49.480 --> 02:26:51.720]  to feed to the insiders.
[02:26:51.720 --> 02:26:55.320]  And first it was two weeks, then a month, now two months out, they knew this thing was
[02:26:55.320 --> 02:26:58.960]  already leaking, having problems and was probably going to blow.
[02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:01.440]  And so, I mean, there you have it right there.
[02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:05.160]  Well, the computers, the computers are on algorithms.
[02:27:05.160 --> 02:27:08.840]  The algorithms in the computer programs actually are able to read the news.
[02:27:08.840 --> 02:27:12.880]  computers read the news now and they interpret intelligence and they can interpret data and
[02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:14.560]  they put the trade in automatically.
[02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:17.000]  So, it bypasses a human element.
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:20.800]  The computer is just trade and the computer put on a massive amount of trade and what
[02:27:20.800 --> 02:27:26.840]  happens is that you go post facto and you pick the trade you want and you dump the trade
[02:27:26.840 --> 02:27:31.240]  you don't want into a flush fund and then you get the government to bail out the flush
[02:27:31.240 --> 02:27:32.240]  fund.
[02:27:32.240 --> 02:27:37.040]  So, this is an advanced version of what we used to call a look-back trade on Wall Street.
[02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:40.480]  So, it's an orgy of profit, they make money when they lose money, they make money when
[02:27:40.480 --> 02:27:46.200]  they make money and they just put it all on us and hire more SWAT teams because they
[02:27:46.200 --> 02:27:48.000]  know it's going to blow sky high.
[02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:52.520]  They put on a massive amount of trade and they pick the ones they want and they dump
[02:27:52.520 --> 02:27:59.600]  the ones they don't want into a flush fund or an off balance sheet account until it blows
[02:27:59.600 --> 02:28:03.920]  up and then they get Geithner and Bernanke to bail out that fund and they say, well,
[02:28:03.920 --> 02:28:07.960]  we never knew that it was going to blow up just because we put in all this toxic dumping
[02:28:07.960 --> 02:28:08.960]  on the way.
[02:28:08.960 --> 02:28:12.000]  I've also read that a lot of stockbrokers have been caught dumping it on their clients
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:15.280]  like they trade with their clients money, not just the big companies and then when there's
[02:28:15.280 --> 02:28:19.000]  a problem they dump the losses on their clients and then keep the money for themselves.
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:24.040]  Well, the losses are handy for corporations who need tax losses to offset gains.
[02:28:24.040 --> 02:28:29.600]  So, this is why less than 50% of the Fortune 500 actually pay taxes because at the end
[02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:35.280]  of the year, brokers sell them losing trade to offset their gains for the year and that's
[02:28:35.280 --> 02:28:37.640]  a big business on Wall Street, I've done it myself.
[02:28:37.640 --> 02:28:42.600]  You go to the company and you say, I've got a $2 million loss on a trade, do you want
[02:28:42.600 --> 02:28:43.600]  it?
[02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:44.600]  That can put in your corporate account.
[02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:45.600]  They'll say, yeah, we'll take it.
[02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:47.600]  You just save them a whole bunch of tax money.
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:52.200]  So, you have a winning trade and you call up your client and you say, I've got a winning
[02:28:52.200 --> 02:28:58.560]  trade and by the way, this is going to cost you per the usual means and you get a kick
[02:28:58.560 --> 02:29:01.080]  back.
[02:29:01.080 --> 02:29:02.240]  Everything is kickbacks.
[02:29:02.240 --> 02:29:03.240]  Everything is corruption.
[02:29:03.240 --> 02:29:08.560]  Well, that's the problem with you have so many trades and there's so little accounting
[02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:09.560]  of the trades.
[02:29:09.560 --> 02:29:13.440]  So, you've got hundreds of thousands of trades going on all the time and nobody's actually
[02:29:13.440 --> 02:29:17.720]  at the end of the day examining these trades and who's making them where they're going
[02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:19.680]  and who's accountable for them.
[02:29:19.680 --> 02:29:26.880]  So, you have all the industries regulating itself and they simply are gaming the system
[02:29:26.880 --> 02:29:31.880]  and they're using computer programs to gain the system in ever faster ways to get to the
[02:29:31.880 --> 02:29:32.880]  fraud and speeding up.
[02:29:32.880 --> 02:29:37.160]  All right, Max, we're going to take calls and get into Internet censorship when we come
[02:29:37.160 --> 02:29:39.560]  back and other topics that you think are important.
[02:29:39.560 --> 02:29:42.520]  In fact, I haven't asked Max yet what he thinks is most important right now.
[02:29:42.520 --> 02:29:47.200]  We'll also talk about the Iran situation, the Israeli papers say, looks like the war
[02:29:47.200 --> 02:29:51.400]  may be on sooner rather than later.
[02:29:51.400 --> 02:29:52.680]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.680 --> 02:29:55.160]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.160 --> 02:30:00.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:05.360]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:30:05.360 --> 02:30:06.360]  What have we got?
[02:30:06.360 --> 02:30:08.880]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:30:08.880 --> 02:30:12.800]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:30:12.800 --> 02:30:17.000]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:21.680]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education,
[02:30:21.680 --> 02:30:22.680]  our money.
[02:30:22.680 --> 02:30:26.760]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:30:26.760 --> 02:30:30.280]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising.
[02:30:30.280 --> 02:30:31.280]  You have been warned.
[02:30:31.280 --> 02:30:32.520]  We have the facts.
[02:30:32.520 --> 02:30:33.680]  We have the constitution.
[02:30:33.680 --> 02:30:34.680]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:30:34.680 --> 02:30:35.680]  We have common law.
[02:30:35.680 --> 02:30:39.760]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you
[02:30:39.760 --> 02:30:41.960]  Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.

[02:32:04.560 --> 02:32:08.840]  Not detergents, but good old fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family
[02:32:08.840 --> 02:32:10.840]  owned and operated American company.
[02:32:10.840 --> 02:32:15.640]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love
[02:32:15.640 --> 02:32:18.320]  these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[02:32:18.320 --> 02:32:22.320]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving triple concentrated soaps

[02:32:35.840 --> 02:32:42.600]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:32:42.600 --> 02:32:46.560]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[02:32:57.760 --> 02:32:58.760]  soap sampler.
[02:32:58.760 --> 02:32:59.760]  Thank you.
[02:32:59.760 --> 02:33:13.760]  I say I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self defense, yeah, read up in my way
[02:33:13.760 --> 02:33:23.760]  one day, and I started out of town, yeah, and I saw sheriff John Brown, all of a sudden
[02:33:23.760 --> 02:33:30.220]  I saw sheriff John Brown came in to shoot me down.
[02:33:30.220 --> 02:33:31.760]  He was coming to shoot him down.
[02:33:31.760 --> 02:33:32.760]  So I shot.
[02:33:32.760 --> 02:33:33.760]  I shot.
[02:33:33.760 --> 02:33:34.760]  I shot.
[02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:38.080]  I mean, what do you do if somebody's coming for no reason to kill you, they can get away
[02:33:38.080 --> 02:33:39.560]  with their corrupt sheriff.
[02:33:39.560 --> 02:33:44.360]  And you defend yourself.
[02:33:44.360 --> 02:33:49.380]  I shot the sheriff.
[02:33:49.380 --> 02:33:51.560]  But he didn't shoot the deputy.
[02:33:51.560 --> 02:33:54.640]  I didn't shoot the deputy.
[02:33:54.640 --> 02:33:56.600]  I mean, think about the society.
[02:33:56.600 --> 02:34:02.640]  You have this giant government out of control robbing us, amassing all this military power,
[02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:09.800]  surveillance power, spy power, following the Bible of corruption, the Bible of oppression,
[02:34:09.800 --> 02:34:17.360]  the Bible of barbarism, and we're here peacefully trying to wake the people up, trying to wake
[02:34:17.360 --> 02:34:21.760]  good people up who are compartmentalizing government so they can stand up and say no,
[02:34:21.760 --> 02:34:23.360]  so that we get our fighting spirit back.
[02:34:23.360 --> 02:34:28.000]  But this go along to get along attitude, this let somebody else stand up, let somebody
[02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:32.600]  else put their head up above the rocks, let somebody else get involved, you know, keep
[02:34:32.600 --> 02:34:33.920]  your head down.
[02:34:33.920 --> 02:34:36.800]  That attitude is not what built America.
[02:34:36.800 --> 02:34:39.560]  And that attitude is just greasing the skids.
[02:34:39.560 --> 02:34:44.560]  It's inviting the oppressors.
[02:34:44.560 --> 02:34:51.080]  Never seen like a little skinny guy at a football game or at the mall or in a parking lot.
[02:34:51.080 --> 02:34:57.120]  And bullies will come over right away in high school and start shoving them around, starting
[02:34:57.120 --> 02:34:58.120]  to fight with them.
[02:34:58.120 --> 02:35:03.120]  Of course, normally what happens is those little skinny guys turn into badasses, as
[02:35:03.120 --> 02:35:05.800]  they say, because they've been beat up so many times.
[02:35:05.800 --> 02:35:13.360]  But the point is, is that you don't want to act like a little scared skinny guy as a society.
[02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:20.520]  You want to commit to stop being cowardly and not just put on the air of being strong.
[02:35:20.520 --> 02:35:21.520]  You need to do it.
[02:35:21.520 --> 02:35:22.960]  I mean, I'm talking to all of you.
[02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:27.400]  You need to be down at your city council this week, speaking up against the police state,
[02:35:27.400 --> 02:35:33.000]  speaking up against federalization of police, speaking up against the corruption going on,
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:36.440]  GMO foods, the impending war with Iran.
[02:35:36.440 --> 02:35:38.000]  You need to be at your state house.
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:39.160]  You need to drive to your state house.
[02:35:39.160 --> 02:35:40.520]  I don't care if it's 200 miles away.
[02:35:40.520 --> 02:35:44.560]  You need to find out who your representative is, your legislator, and go in and talk to
[02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:45.560]  them.
[02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:50.120]  You need to set a date a month from now at the local library to have a video screening,
[02:35:50.120 --> 02:35:53.840]  and then put up flyers around town and say, follow the republic screening this Saturday
[02:35:53.840 --> 02:35:59.640]  at 5 p.m., an important film about the economic implosion and who's behind it, or the Obama
[02:35:59.640 --> 02:36:04.320]  deception, or invisible empire in order to find.
[02:36:04.320 --> 02:36:06.240]  Think about PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:36:06.240 --> 02:36:09.880]  Every subject covered, every guess you can imagine, every issue covered for six and a
[02:36:09.880 --> 02:36:13.000]  half years, every, just tens of thousands of pieces of media.
[02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:16.200]  You go in there, you pick what you want, you burn it to CD, you burn it to desk.
[02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:17.960]  It's all there with easy to use tools.
[02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:20.000]  You give that material to people.
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:23.520]  You got a wife that's arguing with you about vaccines killing people.
[02:36:23.520 --> 02:36:31.960]  You can go download top brain surgeons, epidemiologists, virologists, scientists, EPA doctors, toxicologists
[02:36:31.960 --> 02:36:34.120]  telling you it's deadly.
[02:36:34.120 --> 02:36:37.360]  You can give that to your wife or your husband.
[02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:40.480]  You want to know about martial law, FEMA camps.
[02:36:40.480 --> 02:36:44.240]  We've probably got 20, 30 or more shows in there about it.
[02:36:44.240 --> 02:36:49.840]  We've got police state for the rise of FEMA, the latest up-to-date Pentagon takeover operation,
[02:36:49.840 --> 02:36:54.680]  what's happening, a lot of this secret documents that a lot of people put themselves in danger
[02:36:54.680 --> 02:36:59.080]  to give us, and we put ourselves in danger to publish.
[02:36:59.080 --> 02:37:08.920]  They got death squads after the head of WikiLeaks right now, MSNBC is reporting.
[02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:09.920]  According to Daniel Ellsberg.
[02:37:09.920 --> 02:37:15.920]  All right, I'm going to shut up and go back to our guest, Max Kaiser, maxkaiser.com.
[02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:21.840]  Max, I want to go to calls here, but first the Iran situation.
[02:37:21.840 --> 02:37:24.440]  I mean, what concerns you the most in the world?
[02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:29.800]  All the experts I talked to, my common sense, my research of history, watching past events.
[02:37:29.800 --> 02:37:33.120]  Israel says they may nuke Iran at any time.
[02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:35.880]  I mean, A, do you think it's coming?
[02:37:35.880 --> 02:37:36.880]  B, when?
[02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:40.560]  And C, what will the aftermath be from your research?
[02:37:40.560 --> 02:37:46.440]  Well, I don't understand why Israel is determining America's foreign policy.
[02:37:46.440 --> 02:37:47.920]  But when did that happen?
[02:37:47.920 --> 02:37:53.320]  Is Israel the America's 51st state, or what's going on there?
[02:37:53.320 --> 02:38:01.320]  In other words, it seems like America's outsourced their foreign policy to APEC.
[02:38:01.320 --> 02:38:04.480]  And their interests are not the same as the United States' interests.
[02:38:04.480 --> 02:38:06.360]  It's not the same country.
[02:38:06.360 --> 02:38:07.920]  We don't have the same interests.
[02:38:07.920 --> 02:38:13.240]  They're a small country surrounded by their perceived enemy, and they're extremely paranoid.
[02:38:13.240 --> 02:38:20.000]  Now when you have them, Israelis, formulating America's foreign policy, that paranoia has
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:24.520]  penetrated the inside of a Washington policymaker.
[02:38:24.520 --> 02:38:31.160]  So America now sees itself as a small, ineffective country surrounded by its perceived enemy.
[02:38:31.160 --> 02:38:33.080]  Where did they get that thought from?
[02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:34.280]  Not from the founding fathers.
[02:38:34.280 --> 02:38:35.280]  They got it from Israel.
[02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:36.920]  Well, I think it's more than that.
[02:38:36.920 --> 02:38:37.920]  I mean, they want oil.
[02:38:37.920 --> 02:38:39.040]  They want weapons sales.
[02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:43.840]  They want to encircle China and Russia, and that's part of Zbigniew's grand strategy.
[02:38:43.840 --> 02:38:49.160]  But I agree there is a, well, I mean, the former head of Israeli Defense Forces said we must
[02:38:49.160 --> 02:38:52.960]  act like a mad dog so that the Arabs are scared of us.
[02:38:52.960 --> 02:38:54.440]  We've got to be extremely aggressive.
[02:38:54.440 --> 02:39:01.960]  Well, the $100 billion that the U.S. has given Israel illegally because you can't give aid
[02:39:01.960 --> 02:39:08.160]  to a nuclear armed country that's completely illegal, how about give me back the $100 billion,
[02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:12.360]  give America back the $100 billion, and you can be all the mad dog all day long.
[02:39:12.360 --> 02:39:16.120]  But give me my money first that you owe me, which I figured out they owe me personally
[02:39:16.120 --> 02:39:17.120]  about $2,300.
[02:39:17.120 --> 02:39:24.600]  If I figure out my tax, you know, for the last 25 years, give me back my $2,500, and
[02:39:24.600 --> 02:39:26.680]  then you can be a mad dog all day.
[02:39:26.680 --> 02:39:29.280]  But don't be doing it in my name with my money.
[02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:31.120]  It's not in my interest.
[02:39:31.120 --> 02:39:33.520]  We've got nothing compatible.
[02:39:33.520 --> 02:39:35.120]  We don't have any interest together.
[02:39:35.120 --> 02:39:38.400]  So just be your mad dog self, but not with my money.
[02:39:38.400 --> 02:39:44.600]  Well, I mean, Israel's got 400 high-tech nukes, high-tech cruise missiles, jets, bombers,
[02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:45.600]  tanks.
[02:39:45.600 --> 02:39:48.000]  Israel does not need our help.
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:52.440]  And if they want to start World War III, I mean, that's their business.
[02:39:52.440 --> 02:39:56.840]  But there is going to be blowback on this country, and we know the policy is this nation's
[02:39:56.840 --> 02:39:58.160]  going to be involved.
[02:39:58.160 --> 02:39:59.680]  And Israel knows that.
[02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:05.040]  And the larger interest, the big banks, the military industrial complex, they want a new
[02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:07.960]  war as a political distraction, Max.
[02:40:07.960 --> 02:40:09.680]  What do you mean there will be blowback?
[02:40:09.680 --> 02:40:11.600]  What do you think 9-11 was all about?
[02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:12.600]  That is blowback.
[02:40:12.600 --> 02:40:20.600]  Well, Max, you know that I'm on record, I mean, I believe 9-11 was completely staged.
[02:40:20.600 --> 02:40:27.000]  Well, let me speak in my 9-11 for a second, you know, and talk about the economics.
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:33.000]  David Callahan, who is the executive editor of a magazine called Smart CEO, he submitted
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:34.960]  a Freedom of Information Act.
[02:40:34.960 --> 02:40:36.280]  This is pretty recent now.
[02:40:36.280 --> 02:40:43.840]  To the SEC, regarding pre-9-11 put option, I just picked this up off of zero heads.
[02:40:43.840 --> 02:40:48.960]  Article is SEC, government destroyed documents regarding pre-9-11 put option.
[02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:54.560]  And they came back, and they told him that these documents were destroyed.
[02:40:54.560 --> 02:40:58.280]  Not that they lost them, and not that they needed to keep them, but that they were destroyed.
[02:40:58.280 --> 02:41:04.040]  So he's got an article coming out in the August edition of Executive Editor Smart CEO magazine
[02:41:04.040 --> 02:41:08.120]  about his Freedom of Information Request from the SEC.
[02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:12.040]  And they come back to him and say, this information was destroyed.
[02:41:12.040 --> 02:41:18.600]  Now, concurrently, I've got a project on my pirate, my film site, which is called 9-11
[02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:19.600]  Jackpot.
[02:41:19.600 --> 02:41:27.520]  And it's being produced and directed by a friend of mine here in Paris, who is really
[02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:33.640]  digging into this one piece of the story, the put options that were bought on United
[02:41:33.640 --> 02:41:35.320]  Airlines and American Airlines.
[02:41:35.320 --> 02:41:41.960]  Obviously, if you look at this closely with pre-knowledge of the event, to me, this has
[02:41:41.960 --> 02:41:44.280]  always been the smoking gun.
[02:41:44.280 --> 02:41:49.280]  And the 9-11 official report gives it very little attention.
[02:41:49.280 --> 02:41:53.400]  Well, it's one smoking gun of literally about 100, but it is one of the ones that's really
[02:41:53.400 --> 02:41:59.360]  bona fide, record put options, not against airlines, but against American and United,
[02:41:59.360 --> 02:42:04.880]  specifically leading back the German papers reported to Buzzy Crongaard, Executive Director
[02:42:04.880 --> 02:42:09.360]  of the CIA, who was also heading up a big brokerage firm at the time.
[02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:15.240]  Alex Brown and Son, which I was working at Alex Brown and Son, and I've met Buzzy Crongaard.
[02:42:15.240 --> 02:42:17.880]  And stop the presses.
[02:42:17.880 --> 02:42:19.320]  Let's rewind.
[02:42:19.320 --> 02:42:20.720]  Let's flesh that out.
[02:42:20.720 --> 02:42:21.720]  I didn't know that.
[02:42:21.720 --> 02:42:22.720]  Go ahead.
[02:42:22.720 --> 02:42:23.720]  Yeah.
[02:42:23.720 --> 02:42:27.040]  No, I worked at Alex Brown and I've met Buzzy Crongaard.
[02:42:27.040 --> 02:42:31.680]  And down in Baltimore, where Alex Brown had their headquarter, he then took a job over
[02:42:31.680 --> 02:42:37.600]  with George Tenet at the CIA as a deputy director over at their CIA.
[02:42:37.600 --> 02:42:42.800]  And the amount of information that flows between the CIA and a Baltimore-based brokerage firm
[02:42:42.800 --> 02:42:46.480]  on what, and down there in Maryland, is enormous.
[02:42:46.480 --> 02:42:50.360]  And there's a tremendous amount of chatter between George Tenet and the brokers of Alex
[02:42:50.360 --> 02:42:53.320]  Brown, where these trades were originated.
[02:42:53.320 --> 02:42:57.880]  The fact that the stock market was closed for several days after the attacks, they didn't
[02:42:57.880 --> 02:43:03.680]  anticipate this, which is why you had over $2 million profits were uncollected on these
[02:43:03.680 --> 02:43:08.680]  put options, because they weren't able to close them out on the same day, and journaled
[02:43:08.680 --> 02:43:12.120]  that money somewhere where it couldn't be found, because the markets were closed, because
[02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:14.240]  they closed the stock exchange.
[02:43:14.240 --> 02:43:18.920]  But so Buzzy was at Alex Brown, and I know plenty of people at Alex Brown.
[02:43:18.920 --> 02:43:25.760]  And also, I also have another interesting tie to this, because my company, the Hollywood
[02:43:25.760 --> 02:43:31.320]  Stock Exchange, was bought by Cantor Fitzgerald and moved to the top floor of the World Trade
[02:43:31.320 --> 02:43:33.800]  Tower just three months before the attacks.
[02:43:33.800 --> 02:43:40.000]  So I had people who I knew from HSX who were in the towers, and I also knew people at Alex
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:41.000]  Brown.
[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:46.920]  So I was privy to a lot of chatter, and part of what I've been helping this guy explore
[02:43:46.920 --> 02:43:54.520]  in his film, 9-11 Jackpot, is to really dig down and look at these put, and to look at
[02:43:54.520 --> 02:43:58.040]  what I call the mystery of broker zero.
[02:43:58.040 --> 02:44:04.160]  And this is the mystery of what I have a very strong feeling that I'm going to explore in
[02:44:04.160 --> 02:44:11.960]  this film about a broker that was actually speculating on their own demise, basically
[02:44:11.960 --> 02:44:19.840]  buying these put on these airline stocks unknowingly, unknowing that they were actually speculating
[02:44:19.840 --> 02:44:20.840]  on their own demise.
[02:44:20.840 --> 02:44:26.200]  I think this is a fantastic story, because it epitomizes the entire American business
[02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:33.520]  model today, suicide bankers, banking jihadis, destroying the economy for a quick buck for
[02:44:33.520 --> 02:44:39.200]  a failed ideology, and they're just actually just throwing the entire economy under the
[02:44:39.200 --> 02:44:42.280]  buck.
[02:44:42.280 --> 02:44:43.280]  Well said, Max Kaiser.
[02:44:43.280 --> 02:44:51.040]  Now I want to go to telephone calls for you on a host of issues, but first, I had read
[02:44:51.040 --> 02:44:53.560]  the cyber security bill.
[02:44:53.560 --> 02:44:54.560]  It was all over the news.
[02:44:54.560 --> 02:44:59.560]  It had lined Obama to have kill switch, and Lieberman came out on CNN yesterday.
[02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:03.880]  We're going to play that clip coming up early in the next hour.
[02:45:03.880 --> 02:45:09.160]  The video folks want to watch it in its entirety is in the article, Lieberman, China can shoot
[02:45:09.160 --> 02:45:10.720]  shut down the Internet.
[02:45:10.720 --> 02:45:13.200]  Why can't we, and that's a quote in there.
[02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:15.560]  He said, well, China can shut down the Internet.
[02:45:15.560 --> 02:45:18.120]  Why can't we, it's for our own security.
[02:45:18.120 --> 02:45:23.600]  The Financial Times of London, FCC and Move to Regulate Internet says that they're going
[02:45:23.600 --> 02:45:30.920]  to have a box at all the ISPs, but also in your home that your TV and your Internet is
[02:45:30.920 --> 02:45:32.140]  wired through.
[02:45:32.140 --> 02:45:35.360]  They will both surveil what you're watching and doing.
[02:45:35.360 --> 02:45:40.840]  This is all openly, you know, hidden in plain view in a three to two vote along party lines
[02:45:40.840 --> 02:45:48.360]  at past, and that the box will also block what you're allowed to see, and that they're
[02:45:48.360 --> 02:45:55.080]  going to quote tax the alternative media for a quote government megaphone to fund new government
[02:45:55.080 --> 02:45:59.160]  propaganda that will be bought and purchased on mainstream television.
[02:45:59.160 --> 02:46:03.760]  So the government taking over the mainstream dominant media, shutting down the alternative
[02:46:03.760 --> 02:46:09.280]  media and taxing what's left, I mean, I can't even believe how bold this is.
[02:46:09.280 --> 02:46:12.480]  This is light years ahead of what Communist China does.
[02:46:12.480 --> 02:46:18.520]  They just have ISP firewalls and keyword and web address blockers.
[02:46:18.520 --> 02:46:25.280]  This is going to have that with the NSA controlling all ISPs, and that's only part of it, but
[02:46:25.280 --> 02:46:30.040]  then also a black box in your house or business with everything wired through it.
[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:36.480]  I mean, Max Kaiser, this is, I can't even believe I'm actually seeing them do this.
[02:46:36.480 --> 02:46:38.560]  I mean, this is shocking me.
[02:46:38.560 --> 02:46:48.760]  Okay, well, clearly, the ability to survey at this level is coming online because the
[02:46:48.760 --> 02:46:54.280]  technology associated with it is following what's called the asymptotic curve, which
[02:46:54.280 --> 02:46:57.520]  is the curve toward the zero cost.
[02:46:57.520 --> 02:47:03.120]  All of the technology involved is getting cheaper every single month for storage, processing,
[02:47:03.120 --> 02:47:04.620]  and broadband.
[02:47:04.620 --> 02:47:09.880]  Now the question is, everyone's going to be surveyed and everyone is going to have their
[02:47:09.880 --> 02:47:13.120]  life completely known by the Fed.
[02:47:13.120 --> 02:47:18.160]  So how are you going to incentivize these people to actually do some work when they've
[02:47:18.160 --> 02:47:20.920]  basically been, their lives have been shattered?
[02:47:20.920 --> 02:47:25.960]  And this is where I think you're going to find a trend toward more and more legalized
[02:47:25.960 --> 02:47:26.960]  gambling.
[02:47:26.960 --> 02:47:32.560]  And in the States this past week, now they're talking about legalizing online gambling in
[02:47:32.560 --> 02:47:34.160]  a big, big way.
[02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:38.240]  So you've got, this is, as you can tell, I'm leading up to my theme here, of a casino
[02:47:38.240 --> 02:47:39.240]  gulag.
[02:47:39.240 --> 02:47:45.240]  So you've got people who are stuck in their homes and farther computers being watched 24-7,
[02:47:45.240 --> 02:47:51.360]  but tolerated because they're able to gamble freely on the internet in the hopes that someday
[02:47:51.360 --> 02:47:54.760]  they'll hit the lucky number and they'll escape prison.
[02:47:54.760 --> 02:47:57.120]  And millions and millions of people will start fighting.
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:47:58.120]  Oh, that's right.
[02:47:58.120 --> 02:48:01.280]  You said here two years ago that we're going to have debtor prisons again when we first
[02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:02.760]  started interviewing you.
[02:48:02.760 --> 02:48:09.760]  And now the headlines are all over the U.S. news, in prison for debt, $300, two months
[02:48:09.760 --> 02:48:17.160]  in jail, $365, or $366, in fact, pull up the actual headline.
[02:48:17.160 --> 02:48:22.960]  Woman loses home for $360 something dollars was the headline over unpaid water bill.
[02:48:22.960 --> 02:48:26.400]  I mean, they are now creating debtor prisons.
[02:48:26.400 --> 02:48:27.400]  I'm glad you brought that up.
[02:48:27.400 --> 02:48:31.360]  I did bring it up on your show originally and it's from thestarterdine.com in jail for
[02:48:31.360 --> 02:48:33.080]  being in debt.
[02:48:33.080 --> 02:48:35.520]  And this is becoming a huge trend.
[02:48:35.520 --> 02:48:40.840]  People are finding themselves throwing jail for having a two or $300 in debt and you have
[02:48:40.840 --> 02:48:46.360]  debt t-in-edge and surf, surfs basically as you go into this casino gulag model and
[02:48:46.360 --> 02:48:50.680]  you throw people in the gulag and you put them in front of a computer screen, screen
[02:48:50.680 --> 02:48:55.200]  and you give them credits to gamble with.
[02:48:55.200 --> 02:49:00.720]  And as long as they keep feeding the machine, which in this case is to just keep turning
[02:49:00.720 --> 02:49:01.720]  over these credits.
[02:49:01.720 --> 02:49:03.400]  Well, that's what they say.
[02:49:03.400 --> 02:49:08.560]  They say that of the new debtor prisons that you're going to do customer service, internet
[02:49:08.560 --> 02:49:15.280]  service from a distance, and that now everyone will be working in these private prisons paying
[02:49:15.280 --> 02:49:18.680]  off their debts, that's called forced labor camps.
[02:49:18.680 --> 02:49:19.680]  Absolutely.
[02:49:19.680 --> 02:49:26.240]  And people are willingly marching into these casino gulag and I've been saying this for
[02:49:26.240 --> 02:49:30.120]  a couple of years, I'd like to put my name attached to this concept because it's happening
[02:49:30.120 --> 02:49:34.520]  in real time and it's getting more evidence of it every day.
[02:49:34.520 --> 02:49:37.000]  And they've got computers that they admit that they've wargamed.
[02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:44.040]  The headline a few months ago was 93% of people that own cell phones, they have a 93% accuracy
[02:49:44.040 --> 02:49:49.400]  rate of knowing where you're physically going to drive or go next just after a few months
[02:49:49.400 --> 02:49:51.440]  tracking you by GPS.
[02:49:51.440 --> 02:49:57.240]  They know the hidden patterns before you even know it and I've seen statistics of 99% accuracy
[02:49:57.240 --> 02:50:00.520]  on where you're going to surf next.
[02:50:00.520 --> 02:50:01.520]  After the...
[02:50:01.520 --> 02:50:06.040]  All that predictive technology is borrowed from the casino industry.
[02:50:06.040 --> 02:50:11.720]  That's done all the research on putting, you know, in constructing casinos so that they
[02:50:11.720 --> 02:50:18.240]  appeal to people's emotional fallibility and they use scents, they use smells, they use
[02:50:18.240 --> 02:50:23.080]  all kinds of tricks to predict your behavior, to put you in front of situations where you're
[02:50:23.080 --> 02:50:28.160]  likely to gamble in ways that you can't afford and to put yourself into debt and then they've
[02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:31.280]  got something for you to do and now that you're in debtor's prison.
[02:50:31.280 --> 02:50:37.160]  So all that technology comes from the casino industry which is growing and they're going
[02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:41.520]  to legalize online gambling and that is a huge step towards...
[02:50:41.520 --> 02:50:45.800]  And we won't have any factories, we won't have any jobs, literally our daughters will
[02:50:45.800 --> 02:50:47.440]  all be hookers.
[02:50:47.440 --> 02:50:48.840]  That's all expanding.
[02:50:48.840 --> 02:50:53.600]  Men will work in casinos and then spend their earnings in the casinos and when they get totally
[02:50:53.600 --> 02:50:58.480]  bankrupt they go into the slave labor camp to then work for 25 cents an hour displacing
[02:50:58.480 --> 02:51:01.360]  more of the real economy or they'll be cop enforcers.
[02:51:01.360 --> 02:51:02.360]  Here's a question.
[02:51:02.360 --> 02:51:05.720]  If you have a septic system, did you know that proper maintenance can save you thousands
[02:51:05.720 --> 02:51:08.480]  of dollars in costly and unnecessary repairs?
[02:51:08.480 --> 02:51:09.800]  The answer is simple.

[02:52:05.800 --> 02:52:06.800]  Terany is here.
[02:52:06.800 --> 02:52:10.400]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:52:10.400 --> 02:52:13.120]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:52:13.120 --> 02:52:17.680]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[02:52:17.680 --> 02:52:18.920]  on earth.
[02:52:18.920 --> 02:52:23.720]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being
[02:52:23.720 --> 02:52:25.560]  expanded nationwide.
[02:52:25.560 --> 02:52:29.840]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old
[02:52:29.840 --> 02:52:31.640]  powerful shadow state.
[02:52:31.640 --> 02:52:36.080]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:52:36.080 --> 02:52:40.120]  Repair to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.

[02:52:45.200 --> 02:52:46.200]  corner.
[02:52:46.200 --> 02:52:49.440]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:52:49.440 --> 02:52:51.480]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:52:51.480 --> 02:52:52.480]  It's here.

[02:53:01.280 --> 02:53:05.120]  So you think the mass of Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[02:53:05.120 --> 02:53:06.120]  Think again.
[02:53:06.120 --> 02:53:11.400]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen is now airborne traveling
[02:53:11.400 --> 02:53:14.040]  hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[02:53:14.040 --> 02:53:17.960]  Whether you lived in the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could
[02:53:17.960 --> 02:53:21.160]  cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[02:53:21.160 --> 02:53:25.800]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com

[02:54:09.800 --> 02:54:21.480]  We're going to your calls with Max Kaiser, we're going to talk about the WikiLeaks situation,
[02:54:21.480 --> 02:54:26.680]  and the parliament voting in Iceland to make it an internet free zone for the free press,
[02:54:26.680 --> 02:54:30.680]  maybe the only place in the world where you've got freedom on the internet, problem is, then
[02:54:30.680 --> 02:54:35.120]  the globalists will simply block internet communication out of the country.
[02:54:35.120 --> 02:54:39.320]  But then anything you try to keep people from getting, they go after.
[02:54:39.320 --> 02:54:44.720]  So, one way or another, the genie's out of the bottle, the horse already left the barn,
[02:54:44.720 --> 02:54:49.440]  the cat's out of the bag, that train already left the station, you know all those cliches.
[02:54:49.440 --> 02:54:52.880]  I don't see the system being able to clamp down on it, but if you want to read the article,
[02:54:52.880 --> 02:54:53.880]  it's amazing.
[02:54:53.880 --> 02:54:56.040]  I'm going to play the video coming up in the next hour.
[02:54:56.040 --> 02:54:59.200]  Lieberman says China could shut down the internet, why can't we?
[02:54:59.200 --> 02:55:06.200]  And that article is up at GCNLive.com, another article up there, criminal investigation to
[02:55:06.200 --> 02:55:14.800]  BP, staged oil spill, vital to gulf recovery, also up at GCNLive.com, a golden response
[02:55:14.800 --> 02:55:20.560]  to economic decline from Bob Chapman up on GCNLive.com, here's another one, states need
[02:55:20.560 --> 02:55:24.720]  to launch criminal investigation to BP, federal government's role in the oil spill, Paul Joseph
[02:55:24.720 --> 02:55:31.720]  Watson, GCNLive.com, carbon tax and electricity to send prices skyrocketing, that's up on
[02:55:31.720 --> 02:55:32.720]  GCNLive.com.
[02:55:32.720 --> 02:55:38.640]  Oh, and by the way, I forgot to get to this, it's in my stack here.
[02:55:38.640 --> 02:55:43.560]  The European Union has announced, heck where is that in my stack, I can't keep track of
[02:55:43.560 --> 02:55:49.240]  anything anymore, they have announced that there'll be a ban on private family dwellings,
[02:55:49.240 --> 02:55:54.000]  you've got to live in big compact government buildings, I mean the family is to be erased,
[02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:58.440]  the human species is to fully be removed, this is what the carbon taxes mean in the
[02:55:58.440 --> 02:56:00.800]  end, I will cover that in the next hour as well.
[02:56:00.800 --> 02:56:05.640]  Max, as you see that article on the London Telegraph where they're announcing in the
[02:56:05.640 --> 02:56:11.960]  Euro that they now, you're not going to be allowed to have your own home, you must live
[02:56:11.960 --> 02:56:14.320]  in government communes, how's that sound?
[02:56:14.320 --> 02:56:20.320]  It sounds like massive deflation, which is racking the global economy and it will trend
[02:56:20.320 --> 02:56:28.120]  that it'll continue for the foreseeable future, deflation is really gathering speed and it's
[02:56:28.120 --> 02:56:32.640]  a huge economic problem, the housing market in the U.S. is going to continue to crash
[02:56:32.640 --> 02:56:41.120]  and you've got a big second wave of economic downturn which is now underway.
[02:56:41.120 --> 02:56:44.960]  But getting back about Iceland in terms of Europe, I think Iceland is the most interesting
[02:56:44.960 --> 02:56:47.920]  country in the world right now for the reasons that you just mentioned, they've got this
[02:56:47.920 --> 02:56:53.840]  new free zone for freedom of the press and there's a country that got battered by the
[02:56:53.840 --> 02:56:59.440]  international banking system, they loaded them up with 10 times their GDP and debt then
[02:56:59.440 --> 02:57:04.560]  they pulled the rug out from underneath them, the economy crashed, the corona crashed, the
[02:57:04.560 --> 02:57:08.520]  economy's been decimated and they're coming back from it and they're saying you know what,
[02:57:08.520 --> 02:57:14.680]  let's reinvent ourselves and let's do something that's going to be really positive for the
[02:57:14.680 --> 02:57:16.680]  globe and especially in the media space.
[02:57:16.680 --> 02:57:21.400]  That's right, human ingenuity just like the dot com system is the only revolution we've
[02:57:21.400 --> 02:57:25.760]  had here in the last 20 years and that's what's keeping our economy somewhat alive and that's
[02:57:25.760 --> 02:57:30.680]  what the carbon tax and globalism is about is the bureaucrats won't let you have a new
[02:57:30.680 --> 02:57:36.160]  job or a new industry or anything unless they approve of it or unless they get to deploy
[02:57:36.160 --> 02:57:38.760]  the new technology through their control arm.
[02:57:38.760 --> 02:57:45.000]  Well you know here's something I want to throw out there, you know I mean it's clear that
[02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:54.120]  there are a lot of problems in the US at the moment and the fact is that at some point
[02:57:54.120 --> 02:58:01.880]  there will be millions of people that decide to emigrate and leave the United States and
[02:58:01.880 --> 02:58:08.040]  that's an option that's got to be considered and it's an option that people have done throughout
[02:58:08.040 --> 02:58:16.000]  history and it's a boldified consideration, I mean if the country is simply not going
[02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:21.960]  to support the kind of democracy and freedom that you think you deserve, you may have to
[02:58:21.960 --> 02:58:24.360]  just leave.
[02:58:24.360 --> 02:58:29.400]  Or we can take our republic back, Max I don't want a democracy, I mean I want a constitutional
[02:58:29.400 --> 02:58:33.320]  republic where the minority is protected but I know what you mean by democracy, you mean
[02:58:33.320 --> 02:58:34.880]  where the people are in charge.
[02:58:34.880 --> 02:58:39.240]  I want the Millerites of Constitution to be in charge, Josh, Dan, Rob, Sean, Steve you're
[02:58:39.240 --> 02:58:41.360]  straight ahead, one minute.
[02:58:41.360 --> 02:58:46.960]  On air, online and on demand, they say we offer simple answers to complex problems.
[02:58:46.960 --> 02:58:52.560]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:52.560 --> 02:58:56.560]  Hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:58:56.560 --> 02:59:01.240]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly
[02:59:01.240 --> 02:59:05.400]  into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:59:05.400 --> 02:59:10.040]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:59:10.040 --> 02:59:15.280]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[02:59:15.280 --> 02:59:21.560]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:59:21.560 --> 02:59:25.880]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now
[02:59:25.880 --> 02:59:31.200]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:59:31.200 --> 02:59:36.480]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[02:59:54.040 --> 03:00:15.680]  Changing war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:15.680 --> 03:00:19.640]  International television and radio host Max Keiser is our guest for under 15 minutes.
[03:00:19.640 --> 03:00:25.280]  Now going directly to your phone calls and I'm going to news blitz and then we've got
[03:00:25.280 --> 03:00:31.360]  the guys from my team who were up in Chicago for military urban warfare drills, witness
[03:00:31.360 --> 03:00:35.320]  foreign troops training to take over American cities.
[03:00:35.320 --> 03:00:39.640]  We have the video, it will premiere here coming up in about 35 minutes.
[03:00:39.640 --> 03:00:43.120]  Dan in Canada, thanks for holding, you're on the year.
[03:00:43.120 --> 03:00:49.520]  Hey Max, do you think the Castro brothers down in Cuba would renew the proposal to
[03:00:49.520 --> 03:00:55.120]  move Guantanamo Bay if the oil was to hit their shores, and thanks.
[03:00:55.120 --> 03:01:03.880]  So in other words, the Gulf oil that hits Cuba was going to set up a conflict and whether
[03:01:03.880 --> 03:01:07.800]  or not they would renew the lease on Guantanamo Bay, is that the question?
[03:01:07.800 --> 03:01:09.840]  Yes, that's the question.
[03:01:09.840 --> 03:01:18.400]  I don't think that's really the determining factor in renewing it and why do they keep
[03:01:18.400 --> 03:01:19.400]  it?
[03:01:19.400 --> 03:01:20.400]  Why do they have it there now?
[03:01:20.400 --> 03:01:24.120]  Why don't they throw the U.S. out right now?
[03:01:24.120 --> 03:01:25.880]  They don't need the Gulf to throw out the U.S.
[03:01:25.880 --> 03:01:30.280]  Well Eisenhower called Fidel the Abraham Lincoln of the Caribbean, it's all staged.
[03:01:30.280 --> 03:01:32.800]  Why don't they throw them out right now?
[03:01:32.800 --> 03:01:33.800]  It's all staged.
[03:01:33.800 --> 03:01:40.320]  Okay, but I mean, I don't, what's the, I mean, obviously they're under tremendous
[03:01:40.320 --> 03:01:48.240]  threat, I mean, but I mean, it's interesting because the ecology around Cuba is pristine
[03:01:48.240 --> 03:01:52.600]  just because there, so those, those, yeah, I've seen video the scuba diving there and
[03:01:52.600 --> 03:01:55.800]  let me tell you, my tongue is hanging out on the Gulf of Mexico is becoming like the
[03:01:55.800 --> 03:02:00.360]  Niger Delta.
[03:02:00.360 --> 03:02:05.000]  For those that don't know what the Niger Delta is, why don't you tell them, huh?
[03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:06.520]  Tell folks what the Niger Delta is.
[03:02:06.520 --> 03:02:10.480]  No, no, I'm saying off to go to Niger, it's a huge ecological disaster.
[03:02:10.480 --> 03:02:16.840]  You've got shell oil there, you've got flaming oil, you know, rigs out in the open, it's
[03:02:16.840 --> 03:02:21.680]  become a cesspool of oil because it's just, they've taken on in there and they've destroyed
[03:02:21.680 --> 03:02:26.720]  the ecology that the people are, are under incredible cancerous threat.
[03:02:26.720 --> 03:02:28.840]  And this is what we're going to find in the Gulf of Mexico.
[03:02:28.840 --> 03:02:34.040]  But they had to go dump the oil or Saddam would have gotten the yellow cake.
[03:02:34.040 --> 03:02:36.720]  They're not going to clean it up in the Gulf, they're never going to clean it up.
[03:02:36.720 --> 03:02:42.320]  It's just going to become a festering oozing Gulf of Niger like ecological calamity that
[03:02:42.320 --> 03:02:43.320]  they're never going to clean it up.
[03:02:43.320 --> 03:02:47.000]  They better believe they're going to take the clean up money and give it to their cronies
[03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:49.880]  like Halliburton who'll spend $15 million on a blue tarp.
[03:02:49.880 --> 03:02:55.880]  Well now that they've got some American speaking representative for BP down there, the problem
[03:02:55.880 --> 03:03:00.360]  will seem a lot worse because they'll be able to speak in American accent and say, we're
[03:03:00.360 --> 03:03:05.080]  taking care of the problem and there's nothing, we're going to get it off instead of that
[03:03:05.080 --> 03:03:08.600]  quick British accent that everyone couldn't stand now that we get some good old boy.
[03:03:08.600 --> 03:03:13.000]  Well, it wasn't even a British accent, another guy is British, I couldn't, he was like,
[03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:19.240]  and we will do without, I'm out of the yachting right now, and yes, I believe it, the little
[03:03:19.240 --> 03:03:20.240]  people down there.
[03:03:20.240 --> 03:03:23.400]  Well, folks didn't like being called little people, did they Max?
[03:03:23.400 --> 03:03:29.400]  Well, it tells you the mentality that we're dealing with there, it's that they have a
[03:03:29.400 --> 03:03:36.920]  concept of entitlement that they own everything and we own nothing and it's in our own back
[03:03:36.920 --> 03:03:37.920]  yard.
[03:03:37.920 --> 03:03:38.920]  Alright, let's talk to Rob.
[03:03:38.920 --> 03:03:43.200]  Rob and Tejas, you're on the air, Rob.
[03:03:43.200 --> 03:03:48.080]  Okay, two comments real quick, Max, yes or no, do you think there's really going to
[03:03:48.080 --> 03:03:52.080]  be an attack here in the next week or so?
[03:03:52.080 --> 03:03:55.400]  Okay, I didn't get the first part of that.
[03:03:55.400 --> 03:03:57.360]  Well, that's my question.
[03:03:57.360 --> 03:03:59.480]  Max, on attack on what?
[03:03:59.480 --> 03:04:01.040]  On attack on what?
[03:04:01.040 --> 03:04:02.040]  Iran.
[03:04:02.040 --> 03:04:09.240]  Oh, well, oh boy, yeah, it looks like it's heating up, and...
[03:04:09.240 --> 03:04:13.440]  Well, I want to be clear, hold on, we'll hold both of you over, we have to because the
[03:04:13.440 --> 03:04:18.240]  break's coming up, but did Max say there's going to be an attack in a week or do you
[03:04:18.240 --> 03:04:21.880]  think you heard me say that because I'm not saying that, I mean, who said there's going
[03:04:21.880 --> 03:04:24.480]  to be an attack in a week?
[03:04:24.480 --> 03:04:26.680]  Well the ships are in the Gulf right now, so you know.
[03:04:26.680 --> 03:04:31.560]  Yeah, but they're there to menace right now and then start the blockade and then if Iran
[03:04:31.560 --> 03:04:35.800]  doesn't allow themselves to have all their ships basically pillaged and then fights
[03:04:35.800 --> 03:04:37.440]  back, then that'll be the pretext.
[03:04:37.440 --> 03:04:38.760]  Stay there, both of you.
[03:04:38.760 --> 03:04:41.680]  Max Keiser is our guest, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:04:41.680 --> 03:04:45.920]  We're now five minutes into the final hour, we'll finish up with Rob, Sean, George, Steve,
[03:04:45.920 --> 03:04:49.320]  and then hit one or two other news items with Max Keiser and let him go, and then we're
[03:04:49.320 --> 03:04:55.040]  going to News Blitz, and then I'm going to recap what's happening with VP and my call
[03:04:55.040 --> 03:04:59.000]  for criminal investigation, and then we'll talk about foreign troops in America training
[03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:00.720]  to take your guns.
[03:05:00.720 --> 03:05:05.360]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:05:05.360 --> 03:05:09.680]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:05:09.680 --> 03:05:14.000]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:15.320]  allows you to have.
[03:05:15.320 --> 03:05:21.040]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:05:21.040 --> 03:05:25.360]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[03:05:25.360 --> 03:05:29.380]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:05:29.380 --> 03:05:32.880]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:05:32.880 --> 03:05:36.600]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[03:05:36.600 --> 03:05:41.280]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[03:05:41.280 --> 03:05:45.120]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[03:05:45.120 --> 03:05:46.520]  one of my old sponsors.
[03:05:46.520 --> 03:05:50.760]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:05:50.760 --> 03:05:52.360]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:05:52.360 --> 03:05:59.360]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0305.
[03:05:59.360 --> 03:06:04.640]  You may be arrested and are subject to other police action.
[03:06:04.640 --> 03:06:05.920]  Terany is here.
[03:06:05.920 --> 03:06:09.520]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:06:09.520 --> 03:06:12.240]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:06:12.240 --> 03:06:16.800]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[03:06:16.800 --> 03:06:18.040]  on earth.
[03:06:18.040 --> 03:06:22.840]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[03:06:22.840 --> 03:06:24.680]  expanded nationwide.
[03:06:24.680 --> 03:06:28.720]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an
[03:06:28.720 --> 03:06:30.760]  old powerful shadow state.
[03:06:30.760 --> 03:06:34.800]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[03:06:34.800 --> 03:06:39.240]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:06:39.240 --> 03:06:45.080]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:06:45.080 --> 03:06:48.600]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:06:48.600 --> 03:06:50.640]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:06:50.640 --> 03:06:51.640]  It's here.

[03:07:00.960 --> 03:07:03.960]  Hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:07:03.960 --> 03:07:08.320]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[03:07:08.320 --> 03:07:09.320]  do you want?
[03:07:09.320 --> 03:07:11.320]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:07:11.320 --> 03:07:16.320]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:07:16.320 --> 03:07:17.560]  How much do you want?
[03:07:17.560 --> 03:07:18.640]  When do you want it?
[03:07:18.640 --> 03:07:20.600]  Now or after the battle starts.
[03:07:20.600 --> 03:07:21.600]  When will you need it?
[03:07:21.600 --> 03:07:23.880]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:07:23.880 --> 03:07:25.200]  Will there be any food?
[03:07:25.200 --> 03:07:26.680]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:07:26.680 --> 03:07:30.800]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[03:07:30.800 --> 03:07:32.000]  and be immunized?
[03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:35.760]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:07:35.760 --> 03:07:39.360]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:07:39.360 --> 03:07:40.600]  How much will you need?
[03:07:40.600 --> 03:07:41.600]  We don't know.
[03:07:41.600 --> 03:07:42.600]  How much do you want?
[03:07:42.600 --> 03:07:43.600]  All you can get.
[03:07:43.600 --> 03:07:44.600]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:07:44.600 --> 03:07:52.280]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day, call 1-800-409-5633 or check it
[03:07:52.280 --> 03:08:00.600]  out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com, again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:08:00.600 --> 03:08:02.600]  Life.
[03:08:02.600 --> 03:08:11.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:12.000]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:20.600]  Well, so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin,
[03:08:20.600 --> 03:08:24.000]  Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:41.840]  All right, great minutes into the final hour, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:08:41.840 --> 03:08:44.720]  Max Kaiser is our guest.
[03:08:44.720 --> 03:08:49.520]  Go ahead and finish up your point, Rob, in Texas, about the situation with Iran.
[03:08:49.520 --> 03:08:55.680]  Well, that's all I had for Max, because I was a little worried about what that could
[03:08:55.680 --> 03:09:01.320]  mean for gas prices if there's an attack on Iran, but my final thing, I'll wrap up and
[03:09:01.320 --> 03:09:07.160]  bounce out of here real quick, YouTube is seemingly messing with my views and keeping
[03:09:07.160 --> 03:09:12.920]  my video off the front page, so if the info is out there, it could mobilize and go Google
[03:09:12.920 --> 03:09:18.440]  or YouTube search Dennis Miller's show, Infobombed, and support that video, keep it on that front
[03:09:18.440 --> 03:09:19.680]  page just for a couple of days.
[03:09:19.680 --> 03:09:20.680]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[03:09:20.680 --> 03:09:21.680]  All right, buddy.
[03:09:21.680 --> 03:09:22.680]  Great.
[03:09:22.680 --> 03:09:23.680]  All right, buddy, keep it up.
[03:09:23.680 --> 03:09:24.680]  Good job.
[03:09:24.680 --> 03:09:25.680]  Going back to Max Kaiser.
[03:09:25.680 --> 03:09:26.680]  We can't talk enough about Iran.
[03:09:26.680 --> 03:09:27.680]  I mean, it does.
[03:09:27.680 --> 03:09:30.920]  Israel's saying they may strike them and forget just gas prices.
[03:09:30.920 --> 03:09:32.240]  A lot more could happen.
[03:09:32.240 --> 03:09:35.880]  From your research, what could a strike on Iran turn into, Max?
[03:09:35.880 --> 03:09:41.200]  Well, I mean, yeah, the timing, I agree with the caller, if you look at the oil prices
[03:09:41.200 --> 03:09:48.360]  for timing, that's usually a good indicator of how urgent and where the situation is.
[03:09:48.360 --> 03:09:54.160]  Oil prices at the moment, the past few days, a couple of weeks, are not telegraphing a
[03:09:54.160 --> 03:10:02.080]  huge shock and awe type event, but clearly, they are trying to collar the country with
[03:10:02.080 --> 03:10:19.360]  the same kind of draconian, what do you call it, like they did in Gaza, the embargo.
[03:10:19.360 --> 03:10:25.320]  I think those flotillas, actually, that are flowing into Gaza, I think are having a much
[03:10:25.320 --> 03:10:32.680]  greater impact on how these events are unfolding than people realize, because they are putting
[03:10:32.680 --> 03:10:38.600]  on the front page the real human drama of this prison that's being operated by Israel
[03:10:38.600 --> 03:10:42.880]  in Gaza, a million and a half people held in the concentration camp, and this is putting
[03:10:42.880 --> 03:10:49.040]  onto the front pages the true tragedy of what Israel is doing in that region, and this is,
[03:10:49.040 --> 03:10:53.120]  I think, change the dynamics when it comes to Israel and Iran.
[03:10:53.120 --> 03:10:59.360]  So, I was going to ask you also, Alex, have you ever had on your show George Galloway?
[03:10:59.360 --> 03:11:02.360]  Yes, I have.
[03:11:02.360 --> 03:11:08.760]  I think, I'd love to, if you could get him on again, think of, you know, he's been fantastic
[03:11:08.760 --> 03:11:15.280]  in exposing all of the underlying hypocrisy and atrocity that have been going on in the
[03:11:15.280 --> 03:11:16.280]  region.
[03:11:16.280 --> 03:11:21.280]  Now, that's the British member of parliament from Scotland for those that don't know who
[03:11:21.280 --> 03:11:22.280]  he is.
[03:11:22.280 --> 03:11:23.640]  George Galloway back on.
[03:11:23.640 --> 03:11:27.800]  Yeah, he testified before Congress in the U.S. a couple of years ago, and absolutely
[03:11:27.800 --> 03:11:32.920]  decimated, it's a fantastic YouTube, George Galloway in Washington, where he just tears
[03:11:32.920 --> 03:11:41.120]  apart the inquiry into the food for oil inquiry, and he just absolutely tears people apart
[03:11:41.120 --> 03:11:46.200]  in Congress and makes them look, he's a fantastic orator and a very smart guy, and he knows
[03:11:46.200 --> 03:11:48.200]  that they've written extremely well.
[03:11:48.200 --> 03:11:55.400]  But, you know, I just went at the top of the show when we were talking about the Wall
[03:11:55.400 --> 03:11:59.400]  Street Journal's idea where oil spills somehow increase GDP.
[03:11:59.400 --> 03:12:05.320]  I mean, this is a mindset that we're dealing with, somehow an attack in the Middle East,
[03:12:05.320 --> 03:12:10.320]  another war in the Middle East is somehow going to improve the economy in the U.S.
[03:12:10.320 --> 03:12:12.240]  It's absolute insanity.
[03:12:12.240 --> 03:12:17.360]  There's no way, at this point, given the debt load that the country is carrying, that starting
[03:12:17.360 --> 03:12:23.280]  another war or being a part to another war is going to do anything but just speed up
[03:12:23.280 --> 03:12:29.880]  this calamitous dive into, you know, economic catastrophe.
[03:12:29.880 --> 03:12:34.840]  Well, that's what the big central banks want, and I hope people tuning in realize this is
[03:12:34.840 --> 03:12:35.840]  not hyperbole.
[03:12:35.840 --> 03:12:36.840]  We're not hyping this.
[03:12:36.840 --> 03:12:44.120]  I mean, Israel's saying they may nuke Iran, U.S. and Israeli flotellas are now in place.
[03:12:44.120 --> 03:12:46.680]  The BP disaster is going on unabated.
[03:12:46.680 --> 03:12:50.360]  They're trying to pass carbon taxes, states are going bankrupt left and right, they're
[03:12:50.360 --> 03:12:55.280]  overturning the entire Bill of Rights and Constitution, Obama signed an executive order
[03:12:55.280 --> 03:12:59.400]  mandating lifestyle behavior modification with the federal government running every
[03:12:59.400 --> 03:13:05.520]  facet of our lives, E.U. to ban construction of ordinary family homes by 2020, you must
[03:13:05.520 --> 03:13:07.280]  live in government dormitories.
[03:13:07.280 --> 03:13:08.280]  This is the Borg.
[03:13:08.280 --> 03:13:12.000]  I mean, when I told people years ago that it's going to be a Chinese model where we're
[03:13:12.000 --> 03:13:16.560]  all raised in dormitories and our kids are taken at birth like you take, you know, eggs
[03:13:16.560 --> 03:13:21.040]  from a chicken, as George Arwell said, I mean, this is the plan.
[03:13:21.040 --> 03:13:25.880]  They want to totally re-engineer humanity so it's impossible for us to ever resist.
[03:13:25.880 --> 03:13:30.760]  This is the scientifically playing God, and they're using economic warfare to bank rubbish
[03:13:30.760 --> 03:13:31.760]  and take control.
[03:13:31.760 --> 03:13:34.000]  Sean in Texas, you're on the air with Max Geyser.
[03:13:34.000 --> 03:13:35.000]  Yes, sir.
[03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:40.960]  I'm glad to be on your show, Alex, and Mr. Teiser, good to meet you.
[03:13:40.960 --> 03:13:47.120]  I live right next door to the largest military installation in the world, which is Fort Hood,
[03:13:47.120 --> 03:13:48.120]  Texas.
[03:13:48.120 --> 03:13:53.600]  And I'd like to tell the American people that what's fixing to happen is for real, my family
[03:13:53.600 --> 03:13:57.920]  was born and raised out there in the army camp before it was the camp.
[03:13:57.920 --> 03:14:02.760]  And back in the 40s, the military went out there and moved them off their land and basically
[03:14:02.760 --> 03:14:04.040]  told them they had to leave.
[03:14:04.040 --> 03:14:08.160]  If they didn't leave, they was going to be imprisoned.
[03:14:08.160 --> 03:14:13.680]  And we can only visit our relatives' graves out in that camp on Memorial Day, and artillery
[03:14:13.680 --> 03:14:17.200]  shells hit out there in the cemetery and everything else.
[03:14:17.200 --> 03:14:23.600]  But in this little small town I live in, I'd like to say that the military is gradually
[03:14:23.600 --> 03:14:29.680]  taken over, it's coming into our community, it's coming into our chamber of commerce,
[03:14:29.680 --> 03:14:30.680]  our city.
[03:14:30.680 --> 03:14:35.640]  I'm the fire chaplain here in our town, and I'm in the volunteer fire department.
[03:14:35.640 --> 03:14:41.520]  And we also, in our fire department, had to be FEMA compliant with the Emergency Management
[03:14:41.520 --> 03:14:43.160]  Institute.
[03:14:43.160 --> 03:14:49.880]  And from my understanding that, you know, that's countrywide that we have to do.
[03:14:49.880 --> 03:14:51.360]  No, it's total federalization.
[03:14:51.360 --> 03:14:55.640]  The preachers are secretly being federalized under the clergy response team.
[03:14:55.640 --> 03:15:00.440]  Imagine, secretly they took over the preachers, all the big ones five years ago, and they
[03:15:00.440 --> 03:15:02.840]  are just training for total military takeover.
[03:15:02.840 --> 03:15:08.520]  Now again, we're not saying the military itself is bad, but the people running it are using
[03:15:08.520 --> 03:15:09.960]  it towards an evil purpose.
[03:15:09.960 --> 03:15:13.920]  They're totally federalizing the police with the fusion centers.
[03:15:13.920 --> 03:15:17.800]  Max Kaiser comments on this.
[03:15:17.800 --> 03:15:28.160]  It's, the trend is obviously getting worse, and, but again, my point is that there seems
[03:15:28.160 --> 03:15:36.520]  to be the idea that somehow this contributes towards a positive economic development.
[03:15:36.520 --> 03:15:41.280]  Like for example, that, that corporation I think is a classic example of this, the Corrections
[03:15:41.280 --> 03:15:47.040]  Corps of America, CCA, trades on the New York Stock Exchange, the private prison.
[03:15:47.040 --> 03:15:51.760]  And they also own all the restaurants and all the, and all the hotels near the prison.
[03:15:51.760 --> 03:15:55.200]  So when people go to visit their relatives of prison, they stay in hotels, they eat in
[03:15:55.200 --> 03:15:59.400]  the restaurants, and it's a prison complex, it's a prison industrial complex.
[03:15:59.400 --> 03:16:05.560]  So they're taking tyranny, they're taking the, and they're taking it public, so you
[03:16:05.560 --> 03:16:10.240]  can publicly trade it on the exchange, and you can buy Prison Corps of America, you can
[03:16:10.240 --> 03:16:14.080]  buy Visa and MasterCard, they're basically in the debt slavery business.
[03:16:14.080 --> 03:16:19.040]  You can buy the JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, they're in the usury business, so you can
[03:16:19.040 --> 03:16:24.440]  buy and sell tyranny on the New York Stock Exchange every day, and that's what you can
[03:16:24.440 --> 03:16:25.640]  buy and sell.
[03:16:25.640 --> 03:16:30.480]  And people are involved in their pension accounts and their retirement accounts, and they are
[03:16:30.480 --> 03:16:37.520]  supporting their own prison imprisonment when they are participating and buying shares
[03:16:37.520 --> 03:16:38.520]  in these companies.
[03:16:38.520 --> 03:16:40.520]  You're buying shares in your own imprisonment.
[03:16:40.520 --> 03:16:42.720]  Sean, anything else from Texas?
[03:16:42.720 --> 03:16:48.720]  I'd just like to say you keep the fight up, brother, and don't stop.
[03:16:48.720 --> 03:16:55.800]  Back in the 17th century, when George Washington was our founding father here, you know, he
[03:16:55.800 --> 03:17:00.320]  didn't quit neither against the British, and we have to have some patriots stand up.
[03:17:00.320 --> 03:17:05.000]  Well, I haven't done one-one-hundredth of what George Washington did, that became physical,
[03:17:05.000 --> 03:17:07.120]  and I don't compare myself to that.
[03:17:07.120 --> 03:17:13.200]  I'm here to wake up the George Washington's that are out there but don't know it yet.
[03:17:13.200 --> 03:17:18.040]  And that's my job, and that's what I've always seen my mission is, to get the word
[03:17:18.040 --> 03:17:19.840]  out to the people.
[03:17:19.840 --> 03:17:23.680]  Some will listen, some will have the calling for liberty, others have the spirit of liberty
[03:17:23.680 --> 03:17:25.640]  beating in their hearts, some don't.
[03:17:25.640 --> 03:17:33.560]  And so I'm here warning people, telling people what's really happening, and then, you know,
[03:17:33.560 --> 03:17:36.680]  those people are out there, though, that are going to be our leaders, and it's people out
[03:17:36.680 --> 03:17:37.680]  there listening.
[03:17:37.680 --> 03:17:41.680]  Not all of us are going to be a George Washington or a Thomas Jefferson or a Patrick Henry,
[03:17:41.680 --> 03:17:46.120]  but there were millions of people that played smaller roles in defeating that tyranny.
[03:17:46.120 --> 03:17:48.400]  And I appreciate your call, Sean.
[03:17:48.400 --> 03:17:51.080]  George and Connecticut, you're on the air with Max Kaiser.
[03:17:51.080 --> 03:17:52.080]  Go ahead.
[03:17:52.080 --> 03:17:53.080]  Hi, Max.
[03:17:53.080 --> 03:17:57.760]  I just reminded of something that we were talking about, various things.
[03:17:57.760 --> 03:18:02.000]  But one thing, we won the revolution, not just with bullets, we won with pamphlets.
[03:18:02.000 --> 03:18:06.520]  How can we get a lot of this information out succinctly, put them on everywhere it possibly
[03:18:06.520 --> 03:18:12.920]  can be, like a bullet to people, then they can take the basic information, go to reference
[03:18:12.920 --> 03:18:18.480]  and eat more stuff, and then they'll basically become a force of calling their congressmen,
[03:18:18.480 --> 03:18:24.840]  calling boycotting certain companies who are doing this, make other people more aware of
[03:18:24.840 --> 03:18:30.760]  this stuff, demonstrate if necessary, on and on it goes, you know, something like that.
[03:18:30.760 --> 03:18:35.600]  But the other thing, Alex, I also wanted you to maybe put up those things you need that
[03:18:35.600 --> 03:18:40.800]  you don't have the capability for manpower or money up on some sort of blog that we can
[03:18:40.800 --> 03:18:45.800]  reference regularly, and maybe we can set up groups and organizations that can do that
[03:18:45.800 --> 03:18:46.800]  to you off site.
[03:18:46.800 --> 03:18:49.480]  Well, look, I mean, I don't even need to direct everybody.
[03:18:49.480 --> 03:18:53.960]  I mean, people want to co-confront BP, who's outside their jurisdiction, telling media
[03:18:53.960 --> 03:18:55.600]  they can't be on the beach.
[03:18:55.600 --> 03:18:59.720]  What if 10,000 Americans instead of this big Democrat calling for 100,000 people to go
[03:18:59.720 --> 03:19:00.720]  be violent?
[03:19:00.720 --> 03:19:02.480]  That's exactly what we don't want.
[03:19:02.480 --> 03:19:04.040]  Sounds like a provocateur to me.
[03:19:04.040 --> 03:19:07.120]  Paul Craig Roberts wrote about it and exposed it last week.
[03:19:07.120 --> 03:19:12.880]  What if 10,000 people went with video cameras and had live links to Justin TV, they have
[03:19:12.880 --> 03:19:18.280]  an Apple iPhone app, or even if they take your phone or camera, it's uploading live.
[03:19:18.280 --> 03:19:22.120]  What if 10,000 people, you know, randomly pick different towns on the beach to go out
[03:19:22.120 --> 03:19:24.960]  there and confront these goons peacefully?
[03:19:24.960 --> 03:19:27.320]  That would, in the Info War, expose them.
[03:19:27.320 --> 03:19:30.480]  I mean, you know, I'm thinking about going to the Gulf.
[03:19:30.480 --> 03:19:32.360]  It's going to be going on for a long time, folks.
[03:19:32.360 --> 03:19:34.440]  I'm really worried about Iran right now.
[03:19:34.440 --> 03:19:38.520]  I'm worried about a lot of other issues, and I feel like I can do more here having
[03:19:38.520 --> 03:19:43.400]  guest on and things, but, you know, everybody go there, and it won't be one magic video
[03:19:43.400 --> 03:19:44.960]  that exposes the Gulf.
[03:19:44.960 --> 03:19:47.120]  It'll be thousands of videos together.
[03:19:47.120 --> 03:19:50.120]  Max Kaiser, great job always.
[03:19:50.120 --> 03:19:51.240]  Wonderful to have you on.
[03:19:51.240 --> 03:19:55.880]  Your maiden voyage of a Genesis radio broadcast, 9am, Saturday here on Genesis.
[03:19:55.880 --> 03:19:56.880]  God bless you, buddy.
[03:19:56.880 --> 03:19:57.880]  Good to hear from you.
[03:19:57.880 --> 03:20:01.640]  I will be back with a bunch of news, your calls.
[03:20:01.640 --> 03:20:05.160]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:20:05.160 --> 03:20:09.520]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[03:20:09.520 --> 03:20:10.520]  do you want?
[03:20:10.520 --> 03:20:12.520]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:20:12.520 --> 03:20:17.520]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:20:17.520 --> 03:20:18.760]  How much do you want?
[03:20:18.760 --> 03:20:19.760]  When do you want it?
[03:20:19.760 --> 03:20:22.920]  Now, or after the battle starts, when will you need it?
[03:20:22.920 --> 03:20:25.040]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:20:25.040 --> 03:20:26.400]  Will there be any food?
[03:20:26.400 --> 03:20:27.840]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:20:27.840 --> 03:20:32.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[03:20:32.000 --> 03:20:33.160]  and be immunized?
[03:20:33.160 --> 03:20:36.920]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:20:36.920 --> 03:20:40.520]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:20:40.520 --> 03:20:41.760]  How much will you need?
[03:20:41.760 --> 03:20:42.760]  We don't know.
[03:20:42.760 --> 03:20:43.760]  How much do you want?
[03:20:43.760 --> 03:20:44.760]  All you can get.
[03:20:44.760 --> 03:20:45.760]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:20:45.760 --> 03:20:48.960]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:20:48.960 --> 03:20:56.480]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:20:56.480 --> 03:21:05.480]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:21:05.480 --> 03:21:06.480]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[03:21:06.480 --> 03:21:07.480]  Tyranny is here.
[03:21:07.480 --> 03:21:11.080]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:21:11.080 --> 03:21:13.480]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:21:13.480 --> 03:21:18.040]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[03:21:18.040 --> 03:21:19.280]  on earth.
[03:21:19.280 --> 03:21:24.080]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA cares, now being
[03:21:24.080 --> 03:21:25.920]  expanded nationwide.
[03:21:25.920 --> 03:21:30.600]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful
[03:21:30.600 --> 03:21:32.000]  shadow state.
[03:21:32.000 --> 03:21:36.040]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:21:36.040 --> 03:21:40.480]  Repair to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:21:40.480 --> 03:21:46.320]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:21:46.320 --> 03:21:49.800]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:21:49.800 --> 03:21:51.840]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:21:51.840 --> 03:21:52.840]  It's here.

[03:22:01.080 --> 03:22:03.840]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[03:22:03.840 --> 03:22:05.560]  Are we going to see economic growth?
[03:22:05.560 --> 03:22:07.960]  Slide into a recession or at worst, depression.
[03:22:07.960 --> 03:22:10.320]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[03:22:10.320 --> 03:22:14.600]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety
[03:22:14.600 --> 03:22:15.600]  is prudent.
[03:22:15.600 --> 03:22:18.880]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S. Treasuries are a safe haven.
[03:22:18.880 --> 03:22:23.800]  But what do you do when the U.S. government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[03:22:23.800 --> 03:22:28.000]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper
[03:22:28.000 --> 03:22:29.000]  investments.
[03:22:29.000 --> 03:22:33.600]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing
[03:22:33.600 --> 03:22:38.400]  costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[03:22:38.400 --> 03:22:43.760]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[03:22:43.760 --> 03:22:47.360]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold 6,000-year history.
[03:22:47.360 --> 03:22:53.640]  Remember how gold may be right for you and your IRA by calling 800-686-2237.
[03:22:53.640 --> 03:22:57.040]  Whether buying or it's time for you to sell, the book is free.
[03:22:57.040 --> 03:23:01.040]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:23:01.040 --> 03:23:03.000]  Don't answer it!
[03:23:03.000 --> 03:23:07.000]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings knowing it may be another bill collector,
[03:23:07.000 --> 03:23:10.320]  it's time for you to call 0-Dead in 90 days.
[03:23:10.320 --> 03:23:11.720]  800-477-9256.
[03:23:11.720 --> 03:23:16.720]  Settlements, bankruptcy, and attorneys are not the answer and may end up costing you up
[03:23:16.720 --> 03:23:18.840]  to 10 times more than necessary.
[03:23:18.840 --> 03:23:22.640]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment
[03:23:22.640 --> 03:23:23.640]  plan?
[03:23:23.640 --> 03:23:28.560]  0-Dead in 90 days gets you out of debt in 90 days, guaranteed, without a payment plan,
[03:23:28.560 --> 03:23:30.680]  and without attorneys or going to court.

[03:23:40.760 --> 03:23:45.560]  at 0-Dead in 90 days and we are the only organization to provide written guarantees
[03:23:45.560 --> 03:23:46.560]  on the results.
[03:23:46.560 --> 03:23:56.280]  Go to 0deadguaranteed.com, that's 0deadguaranteed.com, or call now for free information, 800-477-9256.
[03:23:56.280 --> 03:24:22.680]  That's 800-477-9256.
[03:24:22.680 --> 03:24:47.080]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen, for their Monday through Friday 11 a.m., the
[03:24:47.080 --> 03:24:52.240]  3 p.m. central standard time, or central time, depending on the time of the year, 12
[03:24:52.240 --> 03:24:53.240]  o'clock.
[03:24:53.240 --> 03:24:54.240]  Good afternoon to 4 p.m. Eastern.
[03:24:54.240 --> 03:24:59.840]  We're going to have in-studio Rob Doe and Jason Douglas.
[03:24:59.840 --> 03:25:04.640]  I didn't send them to the Gulf because we know what's going on in the Gulf, tyranny.
[03:25:04.640 --> 03:25:09.320]  To urban warfare drills all over Chicago, and I'm glad I sent them because they discovered
[03:25:09.320 --> 03:25:12.040]  a lot of really key information.
[03:25:12.040 --> 03:25:17.840]  They're going to be joining us in premiering video and audio here coming up in the next
[03:25:17.840 --> 03:25:20.480]  segment in-studio with us.
[03:25:20.480 --> 03:25:30.640]  This story is in a whole bunch of mainstream publications in Europe, but the reference
[03:25:30.640 --> 03:25:37.760]  frame website boiled it all down, EU to ban construction of ordinary family homes by 2020.
[03:25:37.760 --> 03:25:42.600]  Control of every facet of everyone's life, that is the game plan.
[03:25:42.600 --> 03:25:46.600]  The European Union has adopted a regulation that will ban the construction of ordinary
[03:25:46.600 --> 03:25:53.840]  family homes starting from 2020, only the so-called passive homes will be allowed.
[03:25:53.840 --> 03:25:59.320]  For example, on page 33 of 71 of the PDF document above says that all new buildings have to
[03:25:59.320 --> 03:26:01.600]  be nearly zero energy buildings.
[03:26:01.600 --> 03:26:04.240]  See, like Bill Gates said, zero energy.
[03:26:04.240 --> 03:26:05.240]  This is total tyranny.
[03:26:05.240 --> 03:26:06.240]  You're not allowed to have energy.
[03:26:06.240 --> 03:26:07.240]  That's siege.
[03:26:07.240 --> 03:26:10.080]  This is high-tech siege by the end of 2020.
[03:26:10.080 --> 03:26:16.400]  It has to be true by the end of 2018 for all new buildings occupied by public authorities.
[03:26:16.400 --> 03:26:22.320]  So that's how they fund the industry of this, is government adopts it first.
[03:26:22.320 --> 03:26:26.880]  One of the first passive houses in Damerstadt, Germany, and I've heard about this house
[03:26:26.880 --> 03:26:34.120]  on NPR, they promote it as it's real cool, the windows are bleak to go to the south.
[03:26:34.120 --> 03:26:39.440]  Also it is not a coincidence as the house is ugly, ugly and compact houses are more
[03:26:39.440 --> 03:26:41.800]  energy efficient.
[03:26:41.800 --> 03:26:43.360]  Everything must look the same too.
[03:26:43.360 --> 03:26:46.180]  The government decides what's on TV, what's on radio.
[03:26:46.180 --> 03:26:48.960]  What your house looks like, how many kids you can have.
[03:26:48.960 --> 03:26:50.960]  Government is God.
[03:26:50.960 --> 03:26:56.480]  A passive house is essentially an ugly cube that covers its energy needs by a perpetual
[03:26:56.480 --> 03:26:59.760]  motion machine or something that has the same carbon footprint.
[03:26:59.760 --> 03:27:06.880]  Also it's super perfectly isolated so that the CO2 you exhale by breathing will get
[03:27:06.880 --> 03:27:08.000]  out of the house.
[03:27:08.000 --> 03:27:15.920]  The EU apparatchniks see another advantage in this passive house if you, I mean it just
[03:27:15.920 --> 03:27:20.720]  goes on and on and of course they'll have to be big houses with a bunch of people living
[03:27:20.720 --> 03:27:23.920]  in it because that uses less material.
[03:27:23.920 --> 03:27:28.920]  At this moment there exist 15,000 passive homes in the world, mostly in Germany, Australia
[03:27:28.920 --> 03:27:31.360]  and Scandinavia and Germany's a model.
[03:27:31.360 --> 03:27:33.120]  Germany has what, 1.2 kids?
[03:27:33.120 --> 03:27:37.040]  So Germany's dying for every two adults, they replace themselves 1.2.
[03:27:37.040 --> 03:27:40.720]  Many German cities are basically half empty and it's like, oh, let's stop having even
[03:27:40.720 --> 03:27:41.720]  more kids.
[03:27:41.720 --> 03:27:43.000]  Let's not build built houses.
[03:27:43.000 --> 03:27:44.160]  Let's be total slaves.
[03:27:44.160 --> 03:27:46.000]  Let's banker bailout.
[03:27:46.000 --> 03:27:47.280]  Everything must go to Goldman Sachs.
[03:27:47.280 --> 03:27:50.280]  Good job Germany, killing yourself.
[03:27:50.280 --> 03:27:55.960]  Japanese passive houses, people would realize that the ordinary houses will become scarce,
[03:27:55.960 --> 03:28:00.080]  limited commodity and their price will jump at least by 10 to 15 percent.
[03:28:00.080 --> 03:28:04.600]  Correspondingly the construction of the classical houses will increase before 2020 because the
[03:28:04.600 --> 03:28:09.120]  developers will be able to sell a higher number of houses in a profitable way because
[03:28:09.120 --> 03:28:12.000]  the price that the buyers will be ready to pay will increase too.
[03:28:12.000 --> 03:28:16.040]  Yeah, but you'll be able to get a special government allowance if you pay kickbacks
[03:28:16.040 --> 03:28:18.960]  though to have a regular house or to be able to have your own home.
[03:28:18.960 --> 03:28:23.360]  Oh, you don't get to live in a house by yourself, it's an apartment building.
[03:28:23.360 --> 03:28:27.880]  However, don't expect that the existing owners will be completely protected against the new
[03:28:27.880 --> 03:28:29.120]  insane politics.
[03:28:29.120 --> 03:28:32.960]  If they want to sell or rent their house or apartment starting in 2012, they will have
[03:28:32.960 --> 03:28:37.360]  to get in a document about the energy efficiency of the real estate, something that costs 500
[03:28:37.360 --> 03:28:38.360]  or so.
[03:28:38.360 --> 03:28:40.320]  And see here in the U.S., they're priming you for this.
[03:28:40.320 --> 03:28:44.960]  You go to buy a washer or dryer and they say, hey, we got $150 coupon, you give the city
[03:28:44.960 --> 03:28:46.460]  of Austin.
[03:28:46.460 --> 03:28:50.960]  My dad went and bought a new washer and dryer this weekend and he said, oh, $150 coupon
[03:28:50.960 --> 03:28:53.280]  here at Home Depot with the city of Austin.
[03:28:53.280 --> 03:28:54.280]  It's real nice.
[03:28:54.280 --> 03:28:57.040]  You get a home inspection and an energy audit.
[03:28:57.040 --> 03:29:02.880]  Well, in a couple of years those become mandatory and in the Senate bill that's passed the house
[03:29:02.880 --> 03:29:04.080]  in one week.
[03:29:04.080 --> 03:29:07.880]  If you don't make the changes they want, your home is forfeited, no court, no nothing.
[03:29:07.880 --> 03:29:13.400]  So they're just training you about how cool and how fun all of this is.
[03:29:13.400 --> 03:29:17.640]  So that is just, just, just total control.
[03:29:17.640 --> 03:29:21.000]  This is the enviro cult that has nothing to do with the environment.
[03:29:21.000 --> 03:29:24.000]  They worried about genetic engineering, cross-species engineering.
[03:29:24.000 --> 03:29:27.680]  Are they worried about things that actually could damage the earth, nuclear weapons, fish
[03:29:27.680 --> 03:29:28.680]  infusion?
[03:29:28.680 --> 03:29:31.800]  Are they worried about the Hadron superconducting, supercollider?
[03:29:31.800 --> 03:29:35.840]  Are they worried about all these super technologies that do endanger the earth?
[03:29:35.840 --> 03:29:36.840]  No.
[03:29:36.840 --> 03:29:42.040]  They're worried that carbon, that all animals exhale is a toxic waste to make you the enemy
[03:29:42.040 --> 03:29:45.280]  and government then can come in and take control of your life.
[03:29:45.280 --> 03:29:51.080]  In studio, coming up, troops training with foreign troops and police to take on the
[03:29:51.080 --> 03:29:52.080]  American people.
[03:29:52.080 --> 03:29:53.080]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.080 --> 03:29:55.520]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.520 --> 03:30:02.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:30:02.200 --> 03:30:06.720]  The fall of America and the western world is an all new ten hour documentary in survival
[03:30:06.720 --> 03:30:08.640]  guide rolled into one.

[03:32:00.560 --> 03:32:02.920]  They help to create a new world order.
[03:32:02.920 --> 03:32:08.880]  We are part of a new world order, a new world order based upon collective action.
[03:32:08.880 --> 03:32:12.600]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[03:32:12.600 --> 03:32:13.600]  documents.
[03:32:13.600 --> 03:32:18.040]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:32:18.040 --> 03:32:20.520]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:32:20.520 --> 03:32:25.200]  The United Nations would take over America, the Tri-Lateral Commission would control
[03:32:25.200 --> 03:32:26.200]  the world.
[03:32:26.200 --> 03:32:31.520]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[03:32:31.520 --> 03:32:34.000]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:32:34.000 --> 03:32:38.480]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[03:32:38.480 --> 03:32:39.480]  financial system.
[03:32:39.480 --> 03:32:42.400]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:32:42.400 --> 03:32:46.080]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:32:46.080 --> 03:32:48.920]  And I got news for you, you're everyone else.
[03:32:48.920 --> 03:32:54.920]  Invisible Empire, secure your copy today at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or watch
[03:32:54.920 --> 03:32:58.360]  it online in the highest quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[03:33:24.920 --> 03:33:54.880]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, the guys came up here and worked some on the weekend.
[03:33:54.880 --> 03:33:59.000]  They have more than 20 hours of footage and they're boiling and they've boiled it down.
[03:33:59.000 --> 03:34:02.320]  They're trying to transfer it over to the computer system right now so we can premiere
[03:34:02.320 --> 03:34:03.320]  it here.
[03:34:03.320 --> 03:34:07.880]  And that's the easiest way to just do it live to actually get it up on prisonplanet.tv.
[03:34:07.880 --> 03:34:12.360]  But it will be up on prisonplanet.tv this evening regardless and we may have it for
[03:34:12.360 --> 03:34:13.800]  you by the end of the show.
[03:34:13.800 --> 03:34:19.240]  But you also have the documents given out by the state police, by the National Guard.
[03:34:19.240 --> 03:34:22.960]  So we've got Jason, Douglas and Rob Dew, two gammer guys.
[03:34:22.960 --> 03:34:29.360]  We also helped direct and edit the film Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, my latest documentary.
[03:34:29.360 --> 03:34:34.720]  Guys go over arriving, what you saw, what you witnessed and people need to understand
[03:34:34.720 --> 03:34:36.120]  I've been to these urban warfare drills.
[03:34:36.120 --> 03:34:41.240]  This is not isolated and they're acclimating the public for military occupation, for schools
[03:34:41.240 --> 03:34:47.120]  to be taken over by troops, military, regular army, foreign troops and I have witnessed
[03:34:47.120 --> 03:34:51.040]  in Hebron, Maryland troops training for gun confiscation, the Marines.
[03:34:51.040 --> 03:34:53.360]  We've witnessed it in Swansboro, North Carolina.
[03:34:53.360 --> 03:34:57.800]  We've witnessed it in Alabama, urban warrior in California, foreign troops with our troops
[03:34:57.800 --> 03:35:02.360]  training with role players who are American terrorists in LA09 last year.
[03:35:02.360 --> 03:35:03.920]  So this is not isolated.
[03:35:03.920 --> 03:35:09.000]  You see troops of the Kentucky Derby, you know, somebody runs out on the field after
[03:35:09.000 --> 03:35:12.400]  the race like everybody, the troops run up with 45s and arrest them.
[03:35:12.400 --> 03:35:14.040]  They didn't have police do it.
[03:35:14.040 --> 03:35:20.120]  No, troops did it year after year, the Super Bowl, Marines running drunk driving checkpoints
[03:35:20.120 --> 03:35:21.120]  all over the country.
[03:35:21.120 --> 03:35:23.200]  Well, what's wrong with the Marines stopping drunks?
[03:35:23.200 --> 03:35:27.800]  We are being acclimated for military occupation and now they admit Brigade Homeland and Homeland
[03:35:27.800 --> 03:35:32.080]  Security and Northcom and the military is training to take on the number one threat,
[03:35:32.080 --> 03:35:37.000]  the former military gun owners, New York Times about Boy Scouts training to take on
[03:35:37.000 --> 03:35:41.200]  disgruntled vets that own guns and we cover that in Police State 4.
[03:35:41.200 --> 03:35:43.440]  You guys did a great job working on that.
[03:35:43.440 --> 03:35:46.440]  I sent you to this, we were not disappointed.
[03:35:46.440 --> 03:35:48.320]  I wish we would have been disappointed.
[03:35:48.320 --> 03:35:51.200]  I wish it would have just been a normal terror drill, but no, it wasn't.
[03:35:51.200 --> 03:35:53.680]  It was a federalization, martial law drill.
[03:35:53.680 --> 03:36:00.200]  So gentlemen, great job up in Chicago and surrounding areas in your five day trip.
[03:36:00.200 --> 03:36:01.480]  Break down what you witnessed.
[03:36:01.480 --> 03:36:02.480]  All right.
[03:36:02.480 --> 03:36:06.960]  Well, we arrived on Saturday and we scattered out some of the locations that they were putting
[03:36:06.960 --> 03:36:10.360]  out in their press releases of where these events were going to be taking place and we
[03:36:10.360 --> 03:36:13.920]  had a hotel pretty close to the first one, which is in Oakland.
[03:36:13.920 --> 03:36:15.840]  It was a train station.
[03:36:15.840 --> 03:36:24.000]  And they were simulating a plane exploding over on its way into Midway Airport and they
[03:36:24.000 --> 03:36:26.640]  took that, they said, off the underwear bomber thing.
[03:36:26.640 --> 03:36:30.960]  So they're using a false flag to justify more terror training.
[03:36:30.960 --> 03:36:36.000]  And so there it was, it was a very small drills, mainly firefighter police and then National
[03:36:36.000 --> 03:36:39.640]  Guard were kind of providing oversight and they had a command vehicle there.
[03:36:39.640 --> 03:36:46.040]  The next day was, we went to Toyota Park and that was the big, that was where their big
[03:36:46.040 --> 03:36:47.040]  staging ground was.
[03:36:47.040 --> 03:36:51.760]  That's where, you know, the 400 to 500 National Guard troops were going to show up.
[03:36:51.760 --> 03:36:54.840]  And from there, they were going to deploy to the different events around the city of
[03:36:54.840 --> 03:36:57.080]  Chicago, which is, it's huge.
[03:36:57.080 --> 03:36:59.720]  I don't know if anybody, if you had never been there, it's really big.
[03:36:59.720 --> 03:37:03.040]  There's a big downtown and then an even bigger suburb.
[03:37:03.040 --> 03:37:09.560]  And so then the next day we went to their second, it was like a smaller command staging
[03:37:09.560 --> 03:37:13.840]  ground in Elk Grove and we saw a lot of their technology that they were using.
[03:37:13.840 --> 03:37:17.560]  They gave us a couple of interviews and then we went down to Bensonville, which is, you
[03:37:17.560 --> 03:37:19.640]  had a caller earlier today, I was listening.
[03:37:19.640 --> 03:37:23.200]  He said that he saw, you know, some stuff going on at Bensonville and that's where the
[03:37:23.200 --> 03:37:24.960]  make, he was saying, he saw you on the news.
[03:37:24.960 --> 03:37:25.960]  Yeah.
[03:37:25.960 --> 03:37:30.320]  Well, I mean, I was all over the place, both me and Douglas were just shooting video everywhere.
[03:37:30.320 --> 03:37:32.000]  And you know, we just went right up to the National Guard.
[03:37:32.000 --> 03:37:36.240]  We got our press passes from them and they pretty much gave us car blanch on, on shooting
[03:37:36.240 --> 03:37:37.240]  whatever.
[03:37:37.240 --> 03:37:40.600]  You know, we just asked questions, they answered them.
[03:37:40.600 --> 03:37:41.600]  They mentioned that.
[03:37:41.600 --> 03:37:45.480]  What about nighttime drills, the guard running around the streets at 1 a.m.
[03:37:45.480 --> 03:37:49.360]  Now there was one nighttime drill that we went to and it was run by the city and they
[03:37:49.360 --> 03:37:53.160]  were, that was a couple of days later and they were very standoffish about it.
[03:37:53.160 --> 03:37:54.720]  It was a gun confiscation drill.
[03:37:54.720 --> 03:37:55.720]  That was the key.
[03:37:55.720 --> 03:37:59.680]  Well, they were, they were going into a train to, with the SWAT team and they didn't want
[03:37:59.680 --> 03:38:01.840]  any, they didn't want the SWAT team shown.
[03:38:01.840 --> 03:38:06.760]  And then after that they were doing decontamination, mainly what the National Guard, from what
[03:38:06.760 --> 03:38:12.120]  we saw was they were doing decontamination exercises of people, except with the one terror
[03:38:12.120 --> 03:38:16.280]  drill where they were, they were going to take out some terrorists and then free some
[03:38:16.280 --> 03:38:17.440]  hostages.
[03:38:17.440 --> 03:38:19.440]  And then there was a chemical spill in there.
[03:38:19.440 --> 03:38:20.600]  And that was with the Boy Scouts.
[03:38:20.600 --> 03:38:21.600]  They were all.
[03:38:21.600 --> 03:38:22.600]  Okay.
[03:38:22.600 --> 03:38:23.600]  We're going to get to the Polish troops.
[03:38:23.600 --> 03:38:24.600]  Yeah.
[03:38:24.600 --> 03:38:28.280]  And the video you have of this, and of course we'll also hold up some of these documents
[03:38:28.280 --> 03:38:29.280]  you have.
[03:38:29.280 --> 03:38:31.840]  We can show the document, can from the ceiling and see some of those.
[03:38:31.840 --> 03:38:36.040]  But Douglas, give me your take and breakdown, your report on what you saw.
[03:38:36.040 --> 03:38:41.360]  Well, the thing that was difficult to wrap your mind around was that they would couch
[03:38:41.360 --> 03:38:46.640]  these, each, each segment of this training exercise was couched in something that was
[03:38:46.640 --> 03:38:49.680]  completely innocuous, you know, a plane crash.
[03:38:49.680 --> 03:38:53.640]  Of course it's a plane crash, but then all of a sudden they start swinging into, there
[03:38:53.640 --> 03:38:56.920]  was terrorist information found inside of the plane.
[03:38:56.920 --> 03:39:02.560]  And then they're, you know, interrogating the people who just fell out of the sky.
[03:39:02.560 --> 03:39:07.160]  You know, they take these training exercises, they have all these different spins that happen
[03:39:07.160 --> 03:39:08.160]  with them.
[03:39:08.160 --> 03:39:10.680]  And so it's not the original, just a plane crash.
[03:39:10.680 --> 03:39:11.960]  It's all of these other things.
[03:39:11.960 --> 03:39:16.120]  And they're following this, this trail of where, you know, they got information from
[03:39:16.120 --> 03:39:20.280]  citizens who just fell out of the sky and now they can go in any direction that they
[03:39:20.280 --> 03:39:21.280]  want.
[03:39:21.280 --> 03:39:22.280]  Or...
[03:39:22.280 --> 03:39:26.040]  Well, yeah, you'll have the cover story, it's like, oh, we're training for Macedonia
[03:39:26.040 --> 03:39:29.600]  and then you get there and they're training to take over San Francisco in the urban warrior
[03:39:29.600 --> 03:39:32.480]  one I went to with the Marines and the foreign troops in Oakland.
[03:39:32.480 --> 03:39:36.800]  I have the footage, it's in police state 2000 and it's all there, them saying, you know,
[03:39:36.800 --> 03:39:40.360]  we're training to take on Americans in San Francisco and they have mock interrogations.
[03:39:40.360 --> 03:39:41.360]  Where'd you get the weapons?
[03:39:41.360 --> 03:39:42.360]  Where'd you get the helmet?
[03:39:42.360 --> 03:39:44.680]  Well, I got it in San Francisco, well, why are you in Oakland?
[03:39:44.680 --> 03:39:48.240]  You know, I'm an American, no, not the camp, I have rights.
[03:39:48.240 --> 03:39:49.680]  That's all on video.
[03:39:49.680 --> 03:39:53.000]  And it's always the same, you know, for the public, it's like, oh, we're doing a bomb,
[03:39:53.000 --> 03:39:54.560]  you decontamination drill.
[03:39:54.560 --> 03:39:58.720]  And then you find out it's a takeover of the city council or it's a takeover of the county
[03:39:58.720 --> 03:39:59.720]  commissioner's office.
[03:39:59.720 --> 03:40:02.680]  I mean, I've seen this in Texas, I've been to him in Texas.
[03:40:02.680 --> 03:40:05.920]  So you have the cover story and then as you said, it then goes off into all these other
[03:40:05.920 --> 03:40:06.920]  directions.
[03:40:06.920 --> 03:40:10.160]  Yeah, and we were told several times that the Polish troops were only going to be there
[03:40:10.160 --> 03:40:16.240]  as observers and then we find out there's Latvian troops there because Militia, Michigan's
[03:40:16.240 --> 03:40:19.560]  sister country, Warsaw Pact country is Latvia.
[03:40:19.560 --> 03:40:24.320]  So they have Latvia troops there because the Michigan National Guard was also participating
[03:40:24.320 --> 03:40:28.240]  and then Illinois is with Poland.
[03:40:28.240 --> 03:40:30.880]  So and again, this just is compartmentalized.
[03:40:30.880 --> 03:40:33.880]  This gets our troops trained to foreign troops, it gets the other foreign troops.
[03:40:33.880 --> 03:40:39.320]  And now in LA09, they admitted 14 nations trained to quote, take on American terrorists.
[03:40:39.320 --> 03:40:43.560]  And so now the news is saying, oh, an emergency Canadian and Mexican troops are going to help
[03:40:43.560 --> 03:40:44.560]  in America.
[03:40:44.560 --> 03:40:49.080]  And then we had our troops up at the Olympics helping run checkpoints.
[03:40:49.080 --> 03:40:50.680]  See how we're all being acclimated.
[03:40:50.680 --> 03:40:51.680]  Oh yeah.
[03:40:51.680 --> 03:40:55.280]  And they do it under the guise of, oh, this is to share information and brotherhood and
[03:40:55.280 --> 03:40:56.280]  all this stuff.
[03:40:56.280 --> 03:40:59.680]  It's like in Iowa, when we had the colonel on that you got on, he said, yeah, we were
[03:40:59.680 --> 03:41:01.720]  training for gun confiscation.
[03:41:01.720 --> 03:41:03.440]  But what's wrong with that?
[03:41:03.440 --> 03:41:05.120]  You're making it a conspiracy theory.
[03:41:05.120 --> 03:41:06.400]  And I said, well, no, you're true.
[03:41:06.400 --> 03:41:11.120]  And then the news wrote an article about me, the conspiracy theorist who scared the town
[03:41:11.120 --> 03:41:12.480]  about gun confiscation.
[03:41:12.480 --> 03:41:16.080]  But their original article said they worked with a local gun dealer who played the part
[03:41:16.080 --> 03:41:20.800]  of the terrorist and they were going door to door and carding for a gun confiscation.
[03:41:20.800 --> 03:41:21.800]  Even admits it.
[03:41:21.800 --> 03:41:22.800]  You were looking for weapons caches.
[03:41:22.800 --> 03:41:23.800]  Yes.
[03:41:23.800 --> 03:41:24.800]  Yes.
[03:41:24.800 --> 03:41:25.800]  We're doing a gun confiscation drill.
[03:41:25.800 --> 03:41:26.800]  We're talking about it.
[03:41:26.800 --> 03:41:27.800]  Right.
[03:41:27.800 --> 03:41:29.320]  And that's, you know, they do it all matter of factly.
[03:41:29.320 --> 03:41:35.480]  So I mean, break down exactly what people are going to see on this prison, if it comes
[03:41:35.480 --> 03:41:38.080]  in when the show ends, we'll just play the video and overdrive it.
[03:41:38.080 --> 03:41:40.080]  It's not, we have it.
[03:41:40.080 --> 03:41:41.080]  Awesome.
[03:41:41.080 --> 03:41:42.080]  It transferred.
[03:41:42.080 --> 03:41:43.080]  How long is this video?
[03:41:43.080 --> 03:41:44.560]  Well, this, I cut it up into two parts.
[03:41:44.560 --> 03:41:49.840]  What you're going to see right when it starts is the guy, Captain Bright, who was kind of
[03:41:49.840 --> 03:41:54.840]  our liaison who was taking us around and then the head of the Polish of their command group.
[03:41:54.840 --> 03:41:58.600]  There's about 13 or 14 Polish soldiers along with firefighters.
[03:41:58.600 --> 03:42:03.080]  And then I guess the best thing to describe as Polish FBI, they wouldn't come on camera
[03:42:03.080 --> 03:42:07.520]  and they were kind of standoffish to us, but it was three individuals who, who just kind
[03:42:07.520 --> 03:42:10.760]  of be, you know, they were observing the whole time, but they were their equivalent of the
[03:42:10.760 --> 03:42:11.760]  FBI as well.
[03:42:11.760 --> 03:42:12.760]  Now, I haven't seen this yet.
[03:42:12.760 --> 03:42:16.680]  I mean, for radio listeners, do we need to narrate this?
[03:42:16.680 --> 03:42:20.480]  Um, yeah, as soon as they pop it up, I'll do some narration and tell them what they're
[03:42:20.480 --> 03:42:21.480]  seeing.
[03:42:21.480 --> 03:42:27.480]  And Douglas, you feel free to pop in now, again, specifically in this drill, uh, and
[03:42:27.480 --> 03:42:28.480]  they let you in there.
[03:42:28.480 --> 03:42:33.400]  It was the Boy Scouts covering their faces and this was a hostage drill or what was this?
[03:42:33.400 --> 03:42:38.520]  It was the whole point of that exercise was hostages had, or terrorists had taken hostages
[03:42:38.520 --> 03:42:40.280]  into a building and sealed it off.
[03:42:40.280 --> 03:42:46.040]  And then they'd also found upon entry, they find chemicals, a spill, which was simulated
[03:42:46.040 --> 03:42:47.280]  with flour.
[03:42:47.280 --> 03:42:49.600]  And so the Boy Scouts were all in that area.
[03:42:49.600 --> 03:42:53.980]  They, uh, come in, they cut the, the door down with using those, uh, kind of rotary
[03:42:53.980 --> 03:42:56.080]  saws that are gas powered.
[03:42:56.080 --> 03:43:00.800]  So they cut through, bust in, uh, they killed the terrorists and, and that was, this was
[03:43:00.800 --> 03:43:01.800]  in the main room.
[03:43:01.800 --> 03:43:04.840]  Were you able to get the sheets on who the terrorists work is in a lot of these drills.
[03:43:04.840 --> 03:43:06.360]  It is American militia.
[03:43:06.360 --> 03:43:08.400]  They didn't, they didn't say anything specifically.
[03:43:08.400 --> 03:43:10.640]  I went up and asked the guys and they just said, no, we're terrorists.
[03:43:10.640 --> 03:43:14.520]  I went and asked the terrorists, are you representing anybody or are you with any particular group?
[03:43:14.520 --> 03:43:17.320]  And they said, no, we're just because in Michigan, they had the drills in the schools where
[03:43:17.320 --> 03:43:19.320]  they were people against public school.
[03:43:19.320 --> 03:43:20.680]  They were homeschool families.
[03:43:20.680 --> 03:43:21.680]  Right.
[03:43:21.680 --> 03:43:25.480]  And they told the kids that we're attacking the school, which is a demonization tactic.
[03:43:25.480 --> 03:43:31.120]  I didn't get that particular information from them, but, but what was clear and, and
[03:43:31.120 --> 03:43:34.200]  in the main room, it was all, uh, Illinois state police.
[03:43:34.200 --> 03:43:36.760]  And then we look over and there's this little spiral staircase and all of a sudden there's
[03:43:36.760 --> 03:43:37.760]  Polish troops there.
[03:43:37.760 --> 03:43:41.000]  And they never mentioned that they were going to be participating in the exercise.
[03:43:41.000 --> 03:43:44.500]  And all of a sudden they start coming down the stairs and then they're kind of cordoning
[03:43:44.500 --> 03:43:48.040]  off the, the Boy Scouts at gunpoint and they're holding them there.
[03:43:48.040 --> 03:43:51.800]  And there was another terrorist staging group there and they actually used a, well, I want
[03:43:51.800 --> 03:43:52.800]  to grenade.
[03:43:52.800 --> 03:43:53.800]  Oh, really?
[03:43:53.800 --> 03:43:54.800]  Yeah.
[03:43:54.800 --> 03:43:58.000]  Well, I want to add that in road attorney, we interview Marine Corps captain who in the
[03:43:58.000 --> 03:44:04.120]  eighties was actually raiding gun dealers homes and offices in a police jacket.
[03:44:04.120 --> 03:44:07.160]  And so they've actually got military engaging in raids everywhere.
[03:44:07.160 --> 03:44:08.600]  That's the next level of secrecy.
[03:44:08.600 --> 03:44:11.280]  Well, and one of the exercises was taken down a meth lab.
[03:44:11.280 --> 03:44:12.480]  They find a meth lab.
[03:44:12.480 --> 03:44:16.360]  So it's automatically this, instead of a local law enforcement issue, it becomes a terrorist
[03:44:16.360 --> 03:44:21.480]  plot because it's, you know, chemical or biological or, you know, they kind of just take, you
[03:44:21.480 --> 03:44:23.720]  know, meth lab and turn that into its mission creep.
[03:44:23.720 --> 03:44:29.600]  I mean, that's like they charged Atari with weapons of mass destruction, a 7.6239 rifle
[03:44:29.600 --> 03:44:37.000]  that fire 7.6239, you know, Eastern block rounds is now a WMD, a weapon of mass destruction.
[03:44:37.000 --> 03:44:38.600]  And of course, now the judge has ordered them to release.
[03:44:38.600 --> 03:44:41.400]  It was all staged, but exactly.
[03:44:41.400 --> 03:44:43.800]  And that, and that, you know, that all happened with the Patriot Act.
[03:44:43.800 --> 03:44:49.080]  And basically any activity that could harm Americans is, or harm people, is now considered.
[03:44:49.080 --> 03:44:52.000]  Yeah, that's section 802, any action that endangered human life is a violation of any
[03:44:52.000 --> 03:44:53.000]  federal or state law.
[03:44:53.000 --> 03:44:54.000]  There you go.
[03:44:54.000 --> 03:44:57.920]  And, and so they're, they're using that power to just keep encroaching and keep creeping
[03:44:57.920 --> 03:44:58.920]  up.
[03:44:58.920 --> 03:45:04.240]  And, and it, when I saw the Polish guys in full combat gear, that's when I started to
[03:45:04.240 --> 03:45:07.800]  get pretty shaken, especially when they were holding, you know, they were right on top
[03:45:07.800 --> 03:45:08.800]  of the Boy Scouts.
[03:45:08.800 --> 03:45:09.800]  Well, they were participating.
[03:45:09.800 --> 03:45:14.400]  I mean, the thing that struck me was when we went to the nighttime drill for Chicago,
[03:45:14.400 --> 03:45:18.920]  their PR person, that was run more like, you know, like a show.
[03:45:18.920 --> 03:45:23.040]  They had the press cordon off to an area, you were only allowed to see certain things.
[03:45:23.040 --> 03:45:24.480]  We were there for three and a half hours.
[03:45:24.480 --> 03:45:28.760]  We have no idea what they were doing around there because they had a staring at a hole.
[03:45:28.760 --> 03:45:34.040]  They had all the press staring at a hole with, you know, their mimicked question answer session.
[03:45:34.040 --> 03:45:38.600]  And they said point blank, there would not be any participation between the Polish troops
[03:45:38.600 --> 03:45:40.760]  or any of the foreign troops and what was going on.
[03:45:40.760 --> 03:45:42.840]  So they lied as observers only.
[03:45:42.840 --> 03:45:43.840]  So they lied.
[03:45:43.840 --> 03:45:44.840]  Of course they did.
[03:45:44.840 --> 03:45:45.840]  How long is the first clip?
[03:45:45.840 --> 03:45:46.840]  It's up.
[03:45:46.840 --> 03:45:47.840]  It should be about four minutes.
[03:45:47.840 --> 03:45:48.840]  Okay.
[03:45:48.840 --> 03:45:49.840]  Let's go ahead and get to that.
[03:45:49.840 --> 03:45:50.840]  Here is that clip.
[03:45:50.840 --> 03:45:51.840]  A video.
[03:45:51.840 --> 03:45:52.840]  I'll be up at prisonplanet.tv.
[03:45:52.840 --> 03:45:55.560]  We're also streaming it live at prisonplanet.tv and we'll narrate it.
[03:45:55.560 --> 03:45:59.560]  That's the, on the left is the, the Polish commander, none on the right is the American
[03:45:59.560 --> 03:46:02.920]  and the green beret guys are going to be the Polish troops.
[03:46:02.920 --> 03:46:05.840]  And that, that was probably the largest group of them.
[03:46:05.840 --> 03:46:11.360]  And that's, those are Douglas's shots from the abandoned houses that they were using.
[03:46:11.360 --> 03:46:16.360]  This is a whole neighborhood basically that O'Hare has been acquiring for the past 15
[03:46:16.360 --> 03:46:17.360]  years.
[03:46:17.360 --> 03:46:18.360]  Right.
[03:46:18.360 --> 03:46:21.760]  And so they have this basically free reign to conduct their exercise here.
[03:46:21.760 --> 03:46:25.440]  And you know, the Polish guys ended up donning hazmat suits.
[03:46:25.440 --> 03:46:28.760]  At one point they're wearing the orange hazmat suits when we get to that.
[03:46:28.760 --> 03:46:36.360]  And here's the whole convoy coming in to start the terror exercises for that day.
[03:46:36.360 --> 03:46:37.360]  And good job guys.
[03:46:37.360 --> 03:46:39.880]  This is really powerful footage.
[03:46:39.880 --> 03:46:41.520]  There's the foreign troops.
[03:46:41.520 --> 03:46:44.920]  And actually these two guys walking towards us, those are the two Latvian troops.
[03:46:44.920 --> 03:46:46.960]  So there's Latvian and Polish.
[03:46:46.960 --> 03:46:47.960]  Right.
[03:46:47.960 --> 03:46:48.960]  Right.
[03:46:48.960 --> 03:46:49.960]  These are the only two Latvian guys.
[03:46:49.960 --> 03:46:52.720]  And then you'll notice there'll be some guys in a black, full black uniform.
[03:46:52.720 --> 03:46:55.320]  They're actually a fire department in Poland.
[03:46:55.320 --> 03:47:01.040]  And then I'll point out the Polish FBI, I guess that's the best name for them.
[03:47:01.040 --> 03:47:02.040]  Yeah.
[03:47:02.040 --> 03:47:03.040]  They kept calling them FBI.
[03:47:03.040 --> 03:47:04.840]  I don't know if that just sounded nicer.
[03:47:04.840 --> 03:47:05.840]  Yeah.
[03:47:05.840 --> 03:47:06.840]  There seemed more secrets.
[03:47:06.840 --> 03:47:08.840]  The Bureau of Counterterrorist Operations, BOA is...
[03:47:08.840 --> 03:47:09.840]  Oh yeah.
[03:47:09.840 --> 03:47:10.840]  Let's show again that...
[03:47:10.840 --> 03:47:12.840]  Well, have we shown those documents yet?
[03:47:12.840 --> 03:47:15.160]  He pointed that out with the Polish troops.
[03:47:15.160 --> 03:47:16.880]  And we got this from Toyota Park.
[03:47:16.880 --> 03:47:18.920]  And there's just the different troops that were there.
[03:47:18.920 --> 03:47:19.920]  There are the kids.
[03:47:19.920 --> 03:47:22.320]  I got quick shots of all the...
[03:47:22.320 --> 03:47:24.240]  You know, I didn't want to really put the kids' faces on.
[03:47:24.240 --> 03:47:25.240]  There's the...
[03:47:25.240 --> 03:47:26.240]  Yeah.
[03:47:26.240 --> 03:47:27.240]  Even though they let us in, we don't show the kids' faces.
[03:47:27.240 --> 03:47:28.240]  And that's good.
[03:47:28.240 --> 03:47:30.240]  But of course, some of these are teenagers.
[03:47:30.240 --> 03:47:32.600]  There's the terrorists going in right there.
[03:47:32.600 --> 03:47:34.600]  And they're going into...
[03:47:34.600 --> 03:47:36.640]  And then here come the troops.
[03:47:36.640 --> 03:47:40.240]  This is the Illinois National Guard coming in to cut through the doorway.
[03:47:40.240 --> 03:47:46.440]  The Illinois National Guard with state police and foreign troops fighting the terrorist.
[03:47:46.440 --> 03:47:48.960]  And the terrorists are two guys with guns.
[03:47:48.960 --> 03:47:54.640]  And of course, then they had their biological agent, which I guess they never really mentioned
[03:47:54.640 --> 03:47:55.640]  what that was.
[03:47:55.640 --> 03:47:56.640]  You guys got everything.
[03:47:56.640 --> 03:47:59.360]  You got him cutting through the door from the inside and the outside.
[03:47:59.360 --> 03:48:00.360]  Great job.
[03:48:00.360 --> 03:48:05.760]  Unfortunately, right now, we're missing the flash bomb that the Polish troops used to
[03:48:05.760 --> 03:48:08.280]  blow out the front of the building.
[03:48:08.280 --> 03:48:09.280]  And go in through there.
[03:48:09.280 --> 03:48:10.280]  Yeah, because...
[03:48:10.280 --> 03:48:11.600]  They pulled us about the National Guard.
[03:48:11.600 --> 03:48:12.800]  They put us in here in the back.
[03:48:12.800 --> 03:48:16.840]  But we didn't learn about the Polish troops until seconds before it happened.
[03:48:16.840 --> 03:48:18.320]  That's how the information was being discovered.
[03:48:18.320 --> 03:48:22.440]  Okay, and you were having some computer problems right beforehand, or can we play it tomorrow?
[03:48:22.440 --> 03:48:24.640]  Or are we going to have time to play that flashbang video?
[03:48:24.640 --> 03:48:25.640]  We didn't get it.
[03:48:25.640 --> 03:48:27.000]  They didn't tell us until moments before...
[03:48:27.000 --> 03:48:28.000]  Oh, I misunderstood.
[03:48:28.000 --> 03:48:30.120]  I thought you said you hadn't done that video yet.
[03:48:30.120 --> 03:48:31.640]  Coordinated it at the same time.
[03:48:31.640 --> 03:48:35.920]  There was the sawing of the door, which we were told about days ahead of time.
[03:48:35.920 --> 03:48:39.080]  But then two seconds before it happened, the flash bomb goes off.
[03:48:39.080 --> 03:48:40.600]  We're going to have Polish guys come from the front.
[03:48:40.600 --> 03:48:45.960]  And here are the kids being trained to go into learned helplessness, submission, fetal
[03:48:45.960 --> 03:48:47.680]  positions.
[03:48:47.680 --> 03:48:52.040]  And then, of course, they separately get these Explorer Scout 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and have
[03:48:52.040 --> 03:48:55.160]  them with mock guns take on disgruntled veterans.
[03:48:55.160 --> 03:48:56.600]  That's the New York Times.
[03:48:56.600 --> 03:49:00.880]  And I guess one of the commanders here is a scout master.
[03:49:00.880 --> 03:49:03.280]  And the side of the patch there, it'll say BOA.
[03:49:03.280 --> 03:49:07.880]  And that's their telltale bureau of anti-terrorism.
[03:49:07.880 --> 03:49:12.840]  Well, I've noticed with this, I was watching old duck and cover videos, and also government
[03:49:12.840 --> 03:49:17.360]  produced COG, continue government videos.
[03:49:17.360 --> 03:49:22.880]  Gunshot in Portland, Oregon, and it's all about martial law during a nuclear attack.
[03:49:22.880 --> 03:49:26.640]  And there they teach everybody learned helplessness, and how you're going to be nuked, and you
[03:49:26.640 --> 03:49:27.640]  get under the table.
[03:49:27.640 --> 03:49:29.680]  And it's the same thing with the kids now in schools.
[03:49:29.680 --> 03:49:33.560]  You get down on your knees, and really it's about submitting to the authority.
[03:49:33.560 --> 03:49:36.680]  When a crisis happens, you get in a fetal position and wait to be shot in the back of
[03:49:36.680 --> 03:49:39.320]  the head, or wait to be loaded on a truck.
[03:49:39.320 --> 03:49:43.800]  So all the kids in America are taught, go with the men with guns, go to the FEMA camp,
[03:49:43.800 --> 03:49:47.320]  get on your knees, you know, they're going to take good care of you.
[03:49:47.320 --> 03:49:53.040]  Polish flag on his shoulder right there, or his arm.
[03:49:53.040 --> 03:49:54.040]  And these guys, you know...
[03:49:54.040 --> 03:49:57.320]  Of course, they use these NATO boys to go into South Ossetia.
[03:49:57.320 --> 03:49:58.320]  Yeah.
[03:49:58.320 --> 03:50:01.360]  So Poland now fully in bed with the New World Order.
[03:50:01.360 --> 03:50:05.800]  And another interesting fact we learned that now that they've have each national guard
[03:50:05.800 --> 03:50:13.280]  of each state work with different Warsaw Pact countries, they're also going to be working
[03:50:13.280 --> 03:50:15.240]  with African countries now.
[03:50:15.240 --> 03:50:16.240]  That's the next step.
[03:50:16.240 --> 03:50:17.240]  That's AFRICOM.
[03:50:17.240 --> 03:50:22.120]  So this is the now cochemical plant where I just put a little bit here down, but you
[03:50:22.120 --> 03:50:26.920]  can see the Polish troops working with them, setting up the DCOM tents, and then they ran
[03:50:26.920 --> 03:50:27.920]  an exercise.
[03:50:27.920 --> 03:50:29.480]  They were supposed to run it at 4 a.m.
[03:50:29.480 --> 03:50:30.480]  And this was...
[03:50:30.480 --> 03:50:33.320]  This is the military having mock drills.
[03:50:33.320 --> 03:50:36.960]  This is all about believing in the imaginary terror monster.
[03:50:36.960 --> 03:50:39.200]  This is just all part of mass mind control, a giant...
[03:50:39.200 --> 03:50:43.360]  The whole thing, they couldn't have one that was just, you know, a natural disaster or
[03:50:43.360 --> 03:50:46.520]  something that was, you know, just regular.
[03:50:46.520 --> 03:50:49.160]  It always had to have a terraplaint at the end.
[03:50:49.160 --> 03:50:54.640]  They always found another piece of the puzzle that brought them closer to the terraplaint.
[03:50:54.640 --> 03:50:55.640]  Total mind control.
[03:50:55.640 --> 03:51:01.920]  Gentlemen, stay there, final segment with your final thoughts, and we'll be right back.
[03:51:01.920 --> 03:51:05.600]  It's the number one reason for slow and clogged bath drains.
[03:51:05.600 --> 03:51:06.600]  That's right.
[03:51:06.600 --> 03:51:07.600]  Hair.
[03:51:07.600 --> 03:51:10.320]  And the number one way to open drains plugged with hair?
[03:51:10.320 --> 03:51:12.400]  The drain clog.
[03:51:12.400 --> 03:51:14.560]  Stop standing in dirty bath water.
[03:51:14.560 --> 03:51:16.480]  Stop using dangerous chemicals.
[03:51:16.480 --> 03:51:20.760]  Push the drain claw past the pop-up in your sink or tub, twist, and pull.
[03:51:20.760 --> 03:51:24.680]  You'll be shocked at what this little tool can pull out of your drain.
[03:51:24.680 --> 03:51:29.680]  The drain claw has over 100 tiny hooks that claw through hair, toothpaste, and shampoo
[03:51:29.680 --> 03:51:32.000]  that slows and clogs your drains.
[03:51:32.000 --> 03:51:35.800]  See how it works right now at thedrainclaw.com.

[03:51:46.760 --> 03:51:49.520]  The drain claw can be used over and over.
[03:51:49.520 --> 03:51:51.160]  Don't be fooled by substitutes.
[03:51:51.160 --> 03:51:52.360]  Buy the original.
[03:51:52.360 --> 03:51:53.880]  Buy the drain claw.

[03:52:01.400 --> 03:52:06.440]  The question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:52:06.440 --> 03:52:07.440]  What have we got?
[03:52:07.440 --> 03:52:09.720]  A republic or a mocking?
[03:52:09.720 --> 03:52:13.600]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:52:13.600 --> 03:52:17.800]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:52:17.800 --> 03:52:22.480]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education,
[03:52:22.480 --> 03:52:23.480]  our money.
[03:52:23.480 --> 03:52:27.560]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:52:27.560 --> 03:52:31.000]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:52:31.000 --> 03:52:32.000]  You have been warned.
[03:52:32.000 --> 03:52:33.360]  We have the facts.
[03:52:33.360 --> 03:52:34.520]  We have the Constitution.
[03:52:34.520 --> 03:52:35.520]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:52:35.520 --> 03:52:36.520]  We have common law.
[03:52:36.520 --> 03:52:40.840]  The privilege is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you.
[03:52:40.840 --> 03:52:41.840]  Don't tread on me.
[03:52:41.840 --> 03:52:42.840]  Rise the republic.
[03:52:42.840 --> 03:52:47.520]  Terrany is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[03:52:47.520 --> 03:52:49.320]  A new tool in the Info War.
[03:52:49.320 --> 03:52:50.320]  Don't tread on me.
[03:52:50.320 --> 03:52:58.440]  Order it at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139 and support
[03:52:58.440 --> 03:53:01.520]  independent patriotic liberty films.
[03:53:01.520 --> 03:53:02.520]  You worry.
[03:53:02.520 --> 03:53:04.480]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[03:53:04.480 --> 03:53:05.480]  Hi.
[03:53:05.480 --> 03:53:07.880]  I'm David Bowling and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[03:53:07.880 --> 03:53:11.280]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's
[03:53:11.280 --> 03:53:12.800]  a learning curve.
[03:53:12.800 --> 03:53:14.880]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[03:53:14.880 --> 03:53:18.360]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[03:53:18.360 --> 03:53:20.160]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[03:53:20.160 --> 03:53:22.960]  Her wild food knowledge package is the Crash Course.
[03:53:22.960 --> 03:53:26.640]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[03:53:26.640 --> 03:53:31.120]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[03:53:31.120 --> 03:53:35.280]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[03:53:35.280 --> 03:53:39.880]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist
[03:53:39.880 --> 03:53:41.440]  in weeks, not years.
[03:53:41.440 --> 03:53:43.760]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[03:53:43.760 --> 03:53:46.000]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[03:53:46.000 --> 03:53:50.880]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[03:53:50.880 --> 03:53:51.880]  Start now.
[03:53:51.880 --> 03:53:53.360]  Knowledge is power.
[03:53:53.360 --> 03:53:54.360]  Better take action.
[03:53:54.360 --> 03:54:17.840]  Make a storm's coming.
[03:54:24.360 --> 03:54:34.120]  Livein' on the road, my friend, was gonna keep you free and clean.
[03:54:34.120 --> 03:54:42.320]  Now you wear your skin like iron, and your breath is hard as kerosene.
[03:54:42.320 --> 03:54:50.000]  Weren't your momma's only boy what her favorite wanted seemed?
[03:54:50.000 --> 03:54:58.000]  She began to cry when you said goodbye.
[03:54:58.000 --> 03:54:59.760]  We only got about five minutes left.
[03:54:59.760 --> 03:55:04.280]  The military now admits they're gonna carry out operations in the United States, brigade
[03:55:04.280 --> 03:55:05.280]  homeland.
[03:55:05.280 --> 03:55:13.960]  They're gonna help with crashed cars, airflights, fight drunk driving, the FBI, CIA, Pentagon,
[03:55:13.960 --> 03:55:15.480]  funding fusion centers locally.
[03:55:15.480 --> 03:55:17.560]  I mean, the feds are taking everything over.
[03:55:17.560 --> 03:55:19.560]  They're trying to the kids to smile on their parents.
[03:55:19.560 --> 03:55:23.760]  This is the opposite of what our country is, but now the new patriotism is salute the troops
[03:55:23.760 --> 03:55:24.760]  and the foreign troops.
[03:55:24.760 --> 03:55:26.160]  But you had a point you wanted to make.
[03:55:26.160 --> 03:55:31.160]  Well, when we first got there, the thing that was such a stark difference to G20, where
[03:55:31.160 --> 03:55:37.360]  we were vermin and spit on, tear gas thrown at us, was how they just rolled out the carpet
[03:55:37.360 --> 03:55:38.360]  for us.
[03:55:38.360 --> 03:55:42.440]  I mean, we were like VIPs, just nobodies from an affiliate in Rockville.
[03:55:42.440 --> 03:55:43.680]  That's because they're selling the fear.
[03:55:43.680 --> 03:55:44.680]  They want you to see this.
[03:55:44.680 --> 03:55:45.680]  Exactly.
[03:55:45.680 --> 03:55:48.680]  What I found out later was that in Alaska, apparently it didn't go so well.
[03:55:48.680 --> 03:55:51.880]  They didn't have as much contact with the press, so people ran with it.
[03:55:51.880 --> 03:55:55.240]  They said that they were locking them up for internment camps.
[03:55:55.240 --> 03:55:58.160]  And the guy that was talking to me about this was very concerned that the-
[03:55:58.160 --> 03:55:59.160]  This is the military.
[03:55:59.160 --> 03:56:02.680]  Right, that the press might have a negative image of what's going on.
[03:56:02.680 --> 03:56:04.000]  So that's why we were let in.
[03:56:04.000 --> 03:56:10.160]  That's why they rolled out the red carpet, because they wanted to seem transparent.
[03:56:10.160 --> 03:56:11.840]  It's this new transparency.
[03:56:11.840 --> 03:56:16.440]  So you're allowed to see the kids being put in fetal positions with the foreign troops.
[03:56:16.440 --> 03:56:17.440]  We have nothing to hide.
[03:56:17.440 --> 03:56:18.440]  It's the new America.
[03:56:18.440 --> 03:56:21.800]  It's all out there, right in front for us to see.
[03:56:21.800 --> 03:56:24.120]  So you were talking to one of the members of the military and they were telling you
[03:56:24.120 --> 03:56:25.120]  this?
[03:56:25.120 --> 03:56:26.120]  Yes.
[03:56:26.120 --> 03:56:27.120]  This was at the night drill.
[03:56:27.120 --> 03:56:28.120]  They were in plain clothes.
[03:56:28.120 --> 03:56:29.120]  We don't get it.
[03:56:29.120 --> 03:56:31.560]  Suddenly the American people don't trust us anymore.
[03:56:31.560 --> 03:56:35.160]  We've got to try an Operation Counter Pro or a Counter Intel Pro.
[03:56:35.160 --> 03:56:36.160]  I don't know.
[03:56:36.160 --> 03:56:39.680]  I mean, they just, they were very, it was, I was kind of amazed at how much they were
[03:56:39.680 --> 03:56:42.280]  just like, you know, you want us to take you around on the golf cart and we'll show
[03:56:42.280 --> 03:56:43.280]  you all the vehicles and-
[03:56:43.280 --> 03:56:47.000]  But that's the whole thing, you know, they have, it's like the face of the new world
[03:56:47.000 --> 03:56:51.560]  order is your brother, your sister, your mother, your father, you know, they don't know what
[03:56:51.560 --> 03:56:53.240]  they're a part of.
[03:56:53.240 --> 03:56:54.240]  They're doing their job.
[03:56:54.240 --> 03:56:58.440]  They think they're trying to save us because all of these drills are natural disasters.
[03:56:58.440 --> 03:57:00.400]  You know, they're coming in to save us.
[03:57:00.400 --> 03:57:06.480]  And then they mix that in with all these fake drills to create like one for a hurricane,
[03:57:06.480 --> 03:57:10.720]  one for a tornado, one for a flood, next one for al-Qaeda attacking.
[03:57:10.720 --> 03:57:11.720]  Yeah.
[03:57:11.720 --> 03:57:12.720]  And that's it.
[03:57:12.720 --> 03:57:16.360]  I mean, it's just blurring the lines of what their responsibilities are.
[03:57:16.360 --> 03:57:21.440]  And then what happens when, you know, it hits the fan, they suddenly come in and they want
[03:57:21.440 --> 03:57:23.560]  to take over every, you know, every aspect.
[03:57:23.560 --> 03:57:28.400]  And then the culmination of all of these drills, you know, we heard about all these aspects.
[03:57:28.400 --> 03:57:32.840]  We came in, they were very transparent about what was going on, you know, this is happening
[03:57:32.840 --> 03:57:34.040]  at this time.
[03:57:34.040 --> 03:57:35.040]  But it's funny.
[03:57:35.040 --> 03:57:38.880]  The thing that they didn't mention that's in none of the literature is that the culmination
[03:57:38.880 --> 03:57:42.880]  of the exercise at the now cochemical plant was a civil disturbance.
[03:57:42.880 --> 03:57:43.880]  Yeah.
[03:57:43.880 --> 03:57:44.880]  Oh, this is key.
[03:57:44.880 --> 03:57:45.880]  Yeah.
[03:57:45.880 --> 03:57:50.160]  And we got word of it the night before it was happening, they said, yeah, we're going
[03:57:50.160 --> 03:57:54.360]  to have a civil disturbance at Toyota Park, which is where their staging ground was.
[03:57:54.360 --> 03:57:56.080]  And we're like, oh, that's not in any of your literature.
[03:57:56.080 --> 03:57:58.640]  And he goes, oh, we just decided to do this one off the cuff.
[03:57:58.640 --> 03:58:00.400]  And we worked right up to the last minute.
[03:58:00.400 --> 03:58:03.240]  We were at the now cochemical plant.
[03:58:03.240 --> 03:58:06.000]  And basically we went straight from there to the airplane.
[03:58:06.000 --> 03:58:07.000]  Yeah.
[03:58:07.000 --> 03:58:08.880]  So we were capturing everything that we could.
[03:58:08.880 --> 03:58:11.000]  And we heard just at the last minute, oh, yeah.
[03:58:11.000 --> 03:58:14.280]  And then the culmination of these exercises is a civil disturbance.
[03:58:14.280 --> 03:58:15.280]  Did you get that?
[03:58:15.280 --> 03:58:16.280]  We didn't.
[03:58:16.280 --> 03:58:19.400]  That was probably about two hours after we took off on our flight.
[03:58:19.400 --> 03:58:22.520]  Oh, so they were scheduled up to a point.
[03:58:22.520 --> 03:58:25.760]  You shot to when they said they were scheduled, and they said, oh, there's something at the
[03:58:25.760 --> 03:58:30.280]  end, which is the civil disturbance knowing media would have pre-programmed when they
[03:58:30.280 --> 03:58:31.280]  could be there.
[03:58:31.280 --> 03:58:32.280]  Right.
[03:58:32.280 --> 03:58:34.760]  Oh, and we missed the civil disturbance, them taking on the American people.
[03:58:34.760 --> 03:58:36.720]  It was a Thursday night thing that was going to happen.
[03:58:36.720 --> 03:58:38.520]  But we got the foreign troops.
[03:58:38.520 --> 03:58:39.520]  Great job, guys.
[03:58:39.520 --> 03:58:45.120]  That's it for today's mission starts now in fallwars.com.
