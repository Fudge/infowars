[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:36.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.800 --> 00:43.080]  welcome ladies and gentlemen it is Thursday November 17 2011 this is
[00:43.080 --> 00:47.680]  Aaron Dyke sitting in Alex is going to be back tomorrow and he should also be
[00:47.680 --> 00:52.440]  popping in later in the hour now we have a different kind of broadcast for you
[00:52.440 --> 00:56.960]  here today first of all we're going to cover a lot of the geoengineering and
[00:56.960 --> 01:02.000]  chemtrails material two nights ago on the infowars nightly news Alex and I
[01:02.000 --> 01:07.120]  hashed through a lot of the material including lots of academic papers lots
[01:07.120 --> 01:13.320]  of unreleased proposals patents and other prima facie evidence that this stuff
[01:13.320 --> 01:17.720]  has been going on and that we are really just kind of regarded as little people
[01:17.720 --> 01:22.160]  who don't need to know the real reasons all under the cloak of global warming
[01:22.160 --> 01:26.840]  you've seen these great films like what in the world are they spraying which we
[01:26.840 --> 01:31.080]  carry here at info wars and we're going to get into that here in the first hour
[01:31.080 --> 01:34.840]  we're going to play clips from that show and get into a lot of the documents
[01:34.840 --> 01:39.760]  we're also going to cover the totally censored episode of Jesse Ventura's
[01:39.760 --> 01:44.320]  conspiracy theory the police state episode covering the establishment of
[01:44.320 --> 01:49.280]  FEMA camps visiting a lot of the prisons that have also been designated for use
[01:49.280 --> 01:54.920]  during emergencies of whatever kind all while we see the very real takeover of
[01:54.920 --> 02:00.080]  the feds going on nationwide among other issues we see Homeland Security
[02:00.080 --> 02:05.840]  playing a role in ousting Occupy Wall Street protesters now Kurt Nemo reports
[02:05.840 --> 02:10.400]  that they're making secret arrest at Occupy Wall Street Portland because the
[02:10.400 --> 02:14.880]  feds have a shared jurisdiction over some of the buildings and parks where the
[02:14.880 --> 02:18.520]  protests are going on so federal protective services under Homeland
[02:18.520 --> 02:23.480]  Security are arresting people that they think have crossed the line and there's
[02:23.480 --> 02:27.240]  all kinds of other stuff going on as well but in the second hour we're going
[02:27.240 --> 02:31.960]  to play some of that very telling very damning police state episode that
[02:31.960 --> 02:35.760]  Ventura worked with Alex on Alex consulted with them and they really hit
[02:35.760 --> 02:38.440]  it hard and covered a lot of important information of course we can't play the
[02:38.440 --> 02:42.720]  whole episode but we're gonna play some large clips and you'll see how real it
[02:42.720 --> 02:47.640]  already is only about a year later and we're also going to be joined later in
[02:47.640 --> 02:52.600]  the broadcast by Patrick Henningson he is in London he's going to be near to
[02:52.600 --> 02:56.320]  one of the Occupy Wall Street protests going on there where police are
[02:56.320 --> 03:01.960]  expected to oust them as well meanwhile they have retaken Zuccotti Park in
[03:01.960 --> 03:06.640]  New York City and there's big protests going on today hopefully things will
[03:06.640 --> 03:10.440]  remain peaceful on the police side as well as the protesters side we know
[03:10.440 --> 03:15.920]  they sent in radical elements and all kinds of provocateurs I'm sure in many
[03:15.920 --> 03:21.080]  of these large cities and we know that the mayors and police forces in these
[03:21.080 --> 03:26.120]  Occupy cities have cordoned together and figured out a plan of what to do
[03:26.120 --> 03:30.240]  nationwide that just happens to resemble it meanwhile you have Paul Joseph
[03:30.240 --> 03:35.560]  Watson MF global money now missing after reports that it was sent to JP Morgan
[03:35.560 --> 03:40.120]  and they've kind of shied away from focusing on the JP Morgan aspect of the
[03:40.120 --> 03:44.440]  missing MF global money but we're going to try to cover some of that as well so
[03:44.440 --> 03:50.080]  stay with us and hopefully Alex will be popping in as well let's get into also
[03:50.080 --> 03:56.160]  Kurt Nemo Herman Cain courts war criminal globalist Henry Kissinger yeah that's
[03:56.160 --> 04:01.080]  the Henry Kissinger from the Nixon and Ford administrations the super insider
[04:01.080 --> 04:06.160]  the extreme Bilderberg attendee the right-hand man of the Rockefeller family
[04:06.160 --> 04:12.000]  among other powerful families and yes Herman Cain if you can't go past skin
[04:12.000 --> 04:16.360]  level if you can't be more than skin deep you may not realize he's nothing
[04:16.360 --> 04:20.960]  but a Federal Reserve stooge he was head of the Kansas City Federal Reserve in
[04:20.960 --> 04:25.040]  the 90s while he was running his famed pizza company which itself was a
[04:25.040 --> 04:29.440]  subsidiary of Pillsbury one of the more elitist food cartels and a skull and
[04:29.440 --> 04:33.480]  bones family member as well anyway he's asked Henry Kissinger to be his
[04:33.480 --> 04:38.120]  secretary of state supposedly Kissinger didn't want to do it but the point is
[04:38.120 --> 04:41.720]  that's who he looks to for foreign policy so if you think that's going to be
[04:41.720 --> 04:46.480]  changed I really hope you can still hold thought in your head stay with us
[04:46.480 --> 04:50.440]  we're going to get into all kinds of secret information stuff they really
[04:50.440 --> 04:54.960]  don't want you to know stay tuned this is the Alex Jones show info wars comm
[04:54.960 --> 05:02.920]  we'll be back on the other side you've heard Alex explain how the silver
[05:02.920 --> 05:06.440]  lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with yourself produced
[05:06.440 --> 05:10.400]  colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire function of the
[05:10.400 --> 05:13.400]  silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver
[05:13.400 --> 05:18.560]  solutions anywhere in or on the body my name is Mario Sephalde and I'm the
[05:18.560 --> 05:22.760]  developer of the silver lungs generator not only does the silver lung system
[05:22.760 --> 05:26.960]  produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped
[05:26.960 --> 05:30.760]  with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[05:30.760 --> 05:37.680]  solutions directly to key target areas this includes the eyes ears nose lungs
[05:37.680 --> 05:42.800]  topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system be sure to watch our
[05:42.800 --> 05:48.680]  new seven-minute video tour of the silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com
[05:48.680 --> 05:54.040]  to learn more about how the silver lung system works as well we are always ready

[08:29.160 --> 08:34.560]  we're back on the Alex Jones show info wars.com I'm Aaron Dyke sitting in as I
[08:34.560 --> 08:38.840]  mentioned before we have a power pack broadcast a little bit different than
[08:38.840 --> 08:42.560]  other ones you may have seen me sitting in on we're gonna air what
[08:42.560 --> 08:47.040]  essentially is censored information later in the second hour that is large
[08:47.040 --> 08:51.520]  clips and segments from Jesse Ventura's conspiracy theory program
[08:51.520 --> 08:56.400]  particularly the police state episode covering FEMA camps and a lot more and
[08:56.400 --> 09:02.400]  that's important because it aired on TruTV on the cable systems but only once
[09:02.400 --> 09:06.120]  and it was never aired again the listings were pulled it was even pulled
[09:06.120 --> 09:10.880]  from cable boxes and there was a lot of behind-the-scene efforts to squash the
[09:10.880 --> 09:15.120]  life of that episode whereas the other episodes hard-hitting as they may be
[09:15.120 --> 09:21.240]  were not quite as in-depth and relevant to the now and they aired repeatedly over
[09:21.240 --> 09:25.720]  and over you have to ask yourself why Alex consulted on that I saw a lot of the
[09:25.720 --> 09:29.640]  behind-the-scenes as well and that information I reviewed it again last
[09:29.640 --> 09:34.040]  night it's very strong and that's why we're going to air it later but consider
[09:34.040 --> 09:39.080]  to the denial you see later in the clip when Ventura confronts the
[09:39.080 --> 09:43.560]  congressman about the FEMA camp bill he co-sponsored and the congressman says
[09:43.560 --> 09:47.040]  there are no FEMA camps that's an imaginary thing that people on the
[09:47.040 --> 09:50.400]  internet come up with that's a paraphrase but he says they don't exist and he
[09:50.400 --> 09:54.640]  says really why is it in the language of the bill here's the bill he says oh yes
[09:54.640 --> 09:59.320]  I remember that now there are camps but that's for emergencies that's in the
[09:59.320 --> 10:03.280]  case of a disaster so it's this total double-think and that's what you see
[10:03.280 --> 10:07.920]  really in many ways a parallel with the chemtrail geoengineering phenomenon
[10:07.920 --> 10:12.560]  which is admitted to be going on and let me try to set the scene for that here
[10:12.560 --> 10:17.320]  Bertrand Russell quotes sir Bertrand Russell he ran with the Fabian
[10:17.320 --> 10:22.600]  Socialist and a lot of the other high-powered globalist groups and his
[10:22.600 --> 10:27.960]  quintessential book among many is the impact of science on society in 1953 and
[10:27.960 --> 10:35.600]  it's just really opens up in a blatant way the relationship of power that
[10:35.600 --> 10:40.000]  science and other aspects of concentrated banking and industry have
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.560]  laid upon us in the 20th and 21st century Bertrand Russell said although
[10:44.560 --> 10:48.920]  the science will be diligently studied it will be rigidly confined to the
[10:48.920 --> 10:53.320]  governing class the populace will not be allowed to know how its convictions
[10:53.320 --> 10:58.640]  were generated he also says in another quote scientific societies are as yet
[10:58.640 --> 11:02.240]  in their infancy it is to be expected that advances in physiology and
[11:02.240 --> 11:06.480]  psychology will give governments more control over individual mentality than
[11:06.480 --> 11:11.880]  they now have even in totalitarian countries he also says gradually by
[11:11.880 --> 11:15.800]  selective breeding congenital differences between rulers and ruled will
[11:15.800 --> 11:20.040]  increase until they are almost a different species and revolt of the
[11:20.040 --> 11:24.080]  plebs as you see now attempted on Occupy Wall Street would become as
[11:24.080 --> 11:27.840]  unthinkable as an organized insurrection of sheep against the practice of eating
[11:27.840 --> 11:32.480]  mutton Bertrand Russell also says that there'd be one kind of education for
[11:32.480 --> 11:36.560]  ordinary men and women another for those who are to become holders of
[11:36.560 --> 11:42.440]  scientific power and goes on in a more lengthy quote to explain how if there's
[11:42.440 --> 11:46.040]  even an accidentally intelligent person they'll be pressured to join or
[11:46.040 --> 11:52.520]  possibly killed and that's all looking forward into what was to come but you
[11:52.520 --> 11:56.200]  could see where there's a real truth to that and you see it in geoengineering
[11:56.200 --> 12:01.920]  with the observed chemtrail phenomenon which is a layman's term that has come
[12:01.920 --> 12:05.320]  about because the government for a long time would not admit that anything was
[12:05.320 --> 12:10.520]  going on just like with the FEMA camps yet now as it's become more and more
[12:10.520 --> 12:14.920]  obvious that something is going on there's been testing lots of observation
[12:14.920 --> 12:19.160]  lots of cross chatter on the internet now you see the rise of the geo
[12:19.160 --> 12:24.840]  engineering rationale you see a lot of academic papers a lot of proposals all
[12:24.840 --> 12:28.880]  saying that it's perfectly good and great as a means of fighting global warming
[12:28.880 --> 12:33.000]  now what's really going on is there's the real behind-the-scenes scientific
[12:33.000 --> 12:38.360]  power cloaked behind national security cloaked behind military clearances
[12:38.360 --> 12:42.560]  organized at the top from the powerful industrial and banking interests that we
[12:42.560 --> 12:46.520]  otherwise know about and they're pursuing one kind of science while the
[12:46.520 --> 12:52.920]  public gets a dumb down made up rationale a la global warming we've seen
[12:52.920 --> 12:56.400]  that debunked repeatedly there's definitely holes and questions in it
[12:56.400 --> 13:00.320]  even if you're still on that side of the fence point of the matter is they're
[13:00.320 --> 13:06.080]  pushing in extremely politicized science while admittedly modifying our
[13:06.080 --> 13:09.960]  entire atmosphere with these experimental programs of geo engineering
[13:09.960 --> 13:14.000]  where they admittedly in their academic papers proposals and patents are
[13:14.000 --> 13:19.800]  spraying aluminum oxide as well as barium and other chemicals into the
[13:19.800 --> 13:24.480]  atmosphere to reflect sunlight to deal with the so-called global warming issue
[13:24.480 --> 13:28.800]  meanwhile what are the real effects of that we try to cover that with Alex and
[13:28.800 --> 13:31.680]  we're going to play some of that clip right now in fact we're going to play
[13:31.680 --> 13:35.000]  the whole thing throughout this hour and I'm going to come back in with some
[13:35.000 --> 13:39.680]  documents and other contextual things but remember Bertrand Russell pointed out
[13:39.680 --> 13:43.400]  how different it would be between the ordinary people and the ruling class
[13:43.400 --> 13:48.400]  totally different specters of science totally different understanding and
[13:48.400 --> 13:52.720]  knowledge two different species if you will of understanding of the world
[13:52.720 --> 13:57.400]  we're supposedly living in let's cue up that chemtrail geo engineering special
[13:57.400 --> 14:02.960]  now yeah outrageous tyranny pouring in around us I feel like I'm trapped in
[14:02.960 --> 14:06.920]  Indiana Jones movie where the sand of the water is pouring into the chamber and
[14:06.920 --> 14:10.320]  I'm saying we got to get out of here it's rising and you know the yuppies the
[14:10.320 --> 14:13.880]  trendies the know-it-alls you know they're they're too busy slicing their
[14:13.880 --> 14:19.680]  arms or hurting themselves or you know wearing diapers as adults well you know
[14:19.680 --> 14:25.640]  whatever little decadence they're into to even worry about a total global
[14:25.640 --> 14:30.040]  government program that's hiding in plain view that they call testing
[14:30.040 --> 14:35.960]  Department of Energy here in the US set up in Europe as well spraying mixed in
[14:35.960 --> 14:39.800]  with the jet fuel in some of the cases mounted to government aircraft all
[14:39.800 --> 14:47.320]  admitted not condensation trails ice crystals no but barium salts limit
[14:47.320 --> 14:53.600]  oxide other nuclei mixed in so that it creates a artificial haze and NASA
[14:53.600 --> 14:59.560]  admits were more than 20% darker less sunlight hitting us you don't just think
[14:59.560 --> 15:02.280]  they put that in the matrix movies you know ten years ago because they thought
[15:02.280 --> 15:06.760]  that up about a global plan to black out the sun but the scourge isn't the
[15:06.760 --> 15:11.600]  machines it's us this is part of the UN says if you don't play ball with them
[15:11.600 --> 15:17.520]  they'll just spray you and and shut down your weather now now now here's my
[15:17.520 --> 15:20.240]  frustration I knew they were gonna announce global government with this
[15:20.240 --> 15:24.720]  European crisis years ago it's now happened I I know all of this I know
[15:24.720 --> 15:27.320]  they're spraying us every day I know they're spraying my family I know we're
[15:27.320 --> 15:31.600]  all filled with heavy metals I know it's hurting us and Aaron Dykes I asked
[15:31.600 --> 15:36.040]  him last Friday I said get together our research for dark skies the documentary
[15:36.040 --> 15:39.080]  we may make it someday but we're just gonna we're just gonna go ahead start
[15:39.080 --> 15:42.560]  releasing the information reports this is just a small part of it right here
[15:42.560 --> 15:47.720]  government documents hour after hour of them on video okay and then I just said
[15:47.720 --> 15:51.720]  look he was literally out there 20 minutes ago before I went live I said get
[15:51.720 --> 15:56.000]  in here we got to present what you've got did you all these video clips all this
[15:56.000 --> 16:00.360]  documentation it's so frustrating will the yuppies even watch will they even
[16:00.360 --> 16:04.680]  care because you get into how they denied this stuff existed but the people
[16:04.680 --> 16:10.320]  that broke down what they were doing accurately name the chemicals that were
[16:10.320 --> 16:13.760]  being used but the question is how long has it been happening why is it
[16:13.760 --> 16:16.840]  happening what's the end game I'll tell you the end game here at the first and
[16:16.840 --> 16:22.920]  we'll go to Aaron the end game is aluminum dioxide and all the soils
[16:22.920 --> 16:26.040]  where you've got to go to companies like Monsanto they're coming out with whole
[16:26.040 --> 16:31.960]  seed lines that will grow in aluminum poison soil but that's only part of it
[16:31.960 --> 16:36.960]  it's about the seed banks the seed arcs all of this it's about weather weapons
[16:36.960 --> 16:40.120]  shutting down regions that don't play ball they're already talking about a
[16:40.120 --> 16:44.520]  Chicago mercantile system that will bet on the weather well it's gonna be a red
[16:44.520 --> 16:48.560]  casino they don't set up casinos without putting their you know finger on it
[16:48.560 --> 16:53.000]  without controlling it this is about playing God this is about world government
[16:53.000 --> 16:58.560]  and this is about genocide and population reduction Aaron I'm gonna
[16:58.560 --> 17:03.320]  interject points here but we've only got about 25 minutes and we'll come back
[17:03.320 --> 17:07.400]  and do part two part three part four because this is so important it shows
[17:07.400 --> 17:11.520]  how they can keep something bigger than Manhattan Project secret we expose it
[17:11.520 --> 17:15.080]  over the years accurately and they come out and go yeah okay we've been doing
[17:15.080 --> 17:18.640]  it's secret but it's for your own good and we admit it's happening but the details
[17:18.640 --> 17:22.960]  are secret so you've got the floor go through as much as you can the video
[17:22.960 --> 17:27.200]  clips all of it this is incredible information yeah just like you saw back
[17:27.200 --> 17:32.080]  in the 70s with Kissinger and the food is a weapon plans under national security
[17:32.080 --> 17:37.600]  you see global warming and chemtrails under a national security proposal and
[17:37.600 --> 17:41.080]  you'll see a lot of the quotes here of Kissinger talking about food is a
[17:41.080 --> 17:46.720]  weapon is the US prepared to accept food rationing to help people who can't or
[17:46.720 --> 17:50.080]  won't control their population growth they're talking about withholding food
[17:50.080 --> 17:53.560]  aid would food be considered an instrument of national power you've
[17:53.560 --> 17:58.880]  heard the Club of Rome talking about how mankind itself is the enemy when it
[17:58.880 --> 18:02.600]  comes to environmental concerns like global warming and the rest of it the
[18:02.600 --> 18:08.520]  real enemy is mankind that is from the 1990s with the Club of Rome group and
[18:08.520 --> 18:13.160]  then coming up that was the head of the CFR too he's also Club of Rome that was
[18:13.160 --> 18:17.600]  Haas saying that all these groups all interlock Alex and you see here where
[18:17.600 --> 18:23.440]  the Air Force wants to quote on the weather by 2025 and more to use it
[18:23.440 --> 18:29.720]  against the enemy and to help their own forces and it goes on to it's not queued
[18:29.720 --> 18:33.200]  properly but Secretary of Defense William Cohen admitting that weather
[18:33.200 --> 18:36.400]  weapons exist that they can create hurricanes earthquakes and the rest of
[18:36.400 --> 18:39.960]  it so this stuff is admitted but it is hidden behind a national security
[18:39.960 --> 18:44.240]  pretext Alex is that the right document well you've got weather as a force
[18:44.240 --> 18:49.200]  multiplier owning the weather 2025 and after that is the quote about William
[18:49.200 --> 18:55.200]  Cohen and how they are able to use weather weapons well take your time I
[18:55.200 --> 18:59.120]  know I said we're in a hurry but but take your time global warming has been
[18:59.120 --> 19:02.840]  called a security threat because it's going to disrupt all these places where
[19:02.840 --> 19:06.120]  there could be droughts or food shortages and you can guess who's going to be
[19:06.120 --> 19:10.360]  there to create the solution here you've got William Cohen saying others are
[19:10.360 --> 19:14.040]  engaging in a type of eco-terrorism where they can alter the climate set off
[19:14.040 --> 19:18.520]  earthquakes volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves it's
[19:18.520 --> 19:21.760]  real that's the reason we have to intensify our efforts he said that in
[19:21.760 --> 19:27.000]  1997 news secretary of defense how's army time Jim and the point is all these
[19:27.000 --> 19:32.480]  military researchers all these national security people are able to manipulate
[19:32.480 --> 19:36.080]  the weather they're spraying God knows what up there we know what some of it is
[19:36.080 --> 19:40.760]  a lot of its aluminum and sulfur deoxide and the rest of it but they've created
[19:40.760 --> 19:44.960]  this way ladies and gentlemen that's just the beginning of this long geo
[19:44.960 --> 19:49.440]  engineering special just getting into the military and national security stuff

[24:13.120 --> 24:36.320]  we are back on the Alex Jones show erin dyke sitting in we are expecting Alex
[24:36.320 --> 24:39.840]  to pop in sometime later in the broadcast we'll see what time that is
[24:39.840 --> 24:44.520]  we're going to try to take some calls as well and we have Patrick Henningson an
[24:44.520 --> 24:49.440]  info wars writer joining us later in the broadcast and there is news such as
[24:49.440 --> 24:54.040]  this analysis piece the technocratic revulsion begins photos and video is
[24:54.040 --> 24:59.280]  thousands of Italians protest Mario Monti's banker government and Mario
[24:59.280 --> 25:04.400]  Monti is a very transparent banking puppet he's been attending Bilderberg
[25:04.400 --> 25:09.560]  as long as my research on it goes back for quite a long time I've been following
[25:09.560 --> 25:15.520]  it intently since at least 2006 when I went with Alex to Canada in Ottawa for
[25:15.520 --> 25:19.400]  the Bilderberg meeting we were held at the border and Mario Monti is very much
[25:19.400 --> 25:25.520]  on the inside of that banking clique now now he's taken over Italy and proposes
[25:25.520 --> 25:29.760]  a technocrats government there's people protesting at least one of the
[25:29.760 --> 25:34.240]  protesters said we don't want the banks to rule and Monti's government is not
[25:34.240 --> 25:38.480]  the solution and it's definitely a situation where the bankers would rule
[25:38.480 --> 25:42.320]  I heard Gerald Salente on the program yesterday I really liked his quote that
[25:42.320 --> 25:46.520]  technocrats are just bureaucrats who know how to use computers to cook the
[25:46.520 --> 25:50.640]  books that's a close paraphrase I don't know if it's word for word but he's
[25:50.640 --> 25:54.360]  definitely got a point there now we're in the middle of examining geo
[25:54.360 --> 25:59.760]  engineering and what the layperson has come to call chemtrails and it's
[25:59.760 --> 26:03.760]  something that independent researchers have latched on to for more than a
[26:03.760 --> 26:09.960]  decade really said what are they spraying and why and those people have been
[26:09.960 --> 26:14.200]  told you're crazy this isn't happening at the same time you've had a flutter of
[26:14.200 --> 26:19.960]  news for the past well almost a decade and here we have the BBC news talking
[26:19.960 --> 26:26.200]  about headline why the Sun seems to be dimming and they go on to talk about the
[26:26.200 --> 26:31.880]  solar energy reaching the surface and how they're trying to offstead that due
[26:31.880 --> 26:36.760]  to global warming you have earth dimming skies before and after that's in
[26:36.760 --> 26:42.680]  wired science in 2009 March 13 and you could see a picture side by side with
[26:42.680 --> 26:48.440]  the Golden Gate Bridge where the shade of the sky has changed due to spraying
[26:48.440 --> 26:52.000]  things into the atmosphere and otherwise trying to modify the solar
[26:52.000 --> 26:55.600]  radiation coming to earth because they think that is the way to fight global
[26:55.600 --> 27:00.600]  warming and it will have all kinds of unforeseen consequences or perhaps they
[27:00.600 --> 27:05.800]  are foreseen again as I pointed out just based on the Bertrand Russell quotes
[27:05.800 --> 27:09.480]  alone we really don't know what this so-called government's up to anymore
[27:09.480 --> 27:13.640]  we do know about their policy papers and all the rest of it and we're going to
[27:13.640 --> 27:19.800]  get back into that clip the expose that I did with Alex on the nightly news from
[27:19.800 --> 27:24.600]  the previous broadcast but we have unilateral geoengineering that's the
[27:24.600 --> 27:29.040]  Council on Foreign Relations workshop where they put forward the same
[27:29.040 --> 27:34.000]  strategies that Nobel Prize winner Paul Crudson put forward to spray sulfur into
[27:34.000 --> 27:39.160]  the atmosphere they talk about producing low-lying clouds based off ocean mist
[27:39.160 --> 27:45.480]  they talk about other ways to change what they term albedos albedos is just a
[27:45.480 --> 27:50.480]  fancy word for reflectivity so they want to change the earth's physical
[27:50.480 --> 27:54.800]  surface from darker shades to more reflective light shades that means
[27:54.800 --> 28:00.160]  changing buildings building codes pavements massive money we're talking
[28:00.160 --> 28:04.200]  about here potentially and they also want to launch solar reflective mirrors
[28:04.200 --> 28:10.240]  into the earth's orbit into space and a massively expensive project that
[28:10.240 --> 28:14.960]  obviously would have military overlays as well and that's really the point here
[28:14.960 --> 28:19.400]  behind the curtain of national security there is another agenda with this geo
[28:19.400 --> 28:23.960]  engineering it has to do with controlling the population and dominating in a
[28:23.960 --> 28:29.160]  military capacity among other things but it's sold to us after a lot of
[28:29.160 --> 28:33.000]  complaining about what are these chemtrails etc on the pretext of fighting
[28:33.000 --> 28:37.160]  global warming and just to put that into perspective you also have Dennis
[28:37.160 --> 28:44.840]  Cassinich's bill HR 2977 that he proposed back in 2001 and keep in mind this
[28:44.840 --> 28:50.000]  was I guess a year after the project for a new American Century PNAC put out
[28:50.000 --> 28:56.000]  their document on the 21st century American Empire rebuilding America's
[28:56.000 --> 29:00.720]  defenses which among other things talks about using biochemical weapons and
[29:00.720 --> 29:06.400]  about dominating in space about owning space there's also the Air Force
[29:06.400 --> 29:12.520]  document owning the weather by 2025 using weather as a force multiplier so they
[29:12.520 --> 29:18.240]  are using weather for military dominance capabilities we know they've been
[29:18.240 --> 29:23.160]  doing that at least in a testing phase since the early 20s both on the Russian
[29:23.160 --> 29:28.560]  and American side with cloud seating we've talked to the experts and we're
[29:28.560 --> 29:32.640]  gonna get into that but Dennis Cassinich's bill talks about banning
[29:32.640 --> 29:37.080]  exotic weapons high-frequency weapons space weapons and quote-unquote chemtrails
[29:37.080 --> 29:42.120]  he was just absolutely assailed over that you know they tried to tarnish his
[29:42.120 --> 29:45.800]  reputation but in the end there's a lot of truth to it isn't there we're gonna
[29:45.800 --> 29:51.160]  play more of those clips on the other side stay tuned we're on the March the
[29:51.160 --> 29:58.160]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[33:33.280 --> 33:37.040]  there's a lot of documentation in there even this one playing will not be
[33:37.040 --> 33:40.640]  enough if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv which should be very
[33:40.640 --> 33:45.200]  easy right now because we have a trial going on this month and later we have a
[33:45.200 --> 33:50.960]  special for Christmas time we can get a very cheap package deal for a year
[33:50.960 --> 33:55.000]  subscription you can also get it with the DVDs and the year subscription for
[33:55.000 --> 34:00.000]  129.95 I believe check that out we're going to get into the meat and
[34:00.000 --> 34:03.280]  potatoes of that you want to stop it you want to look up the documentation to
[34:03.280 --> 34:07.040]  get into it because even here on the show even on the nightly news we can't
[34:07.040 --> 34:10.480]  begin to get into it Alex asked me to come on because I have all these
[34:10.480 --> 34:15.200]  documents compiled just related to the admitted geoengineering programs going
[34:15.200 --> 34:19.480]  on and the attempt to see what's going on behind the scenes of that matrix
[34:19.480 --> 34:24.600]  because you've got a lot of politicized science a small niche of the same
[34:24.600 --> 34:28.560]  scientists who are heard at the council on foreign relations and in all these
[34:28.560 --> 34:34.240]  politicized science groups fronting for the global warming thing assuming on a
[34:34.240 --> 34:38.200]  logical fallacy that all those conclusions are correct and then moving
[34:38.200 --> 34:41.800]  forward with these radical geoengineering spraying things into our
[34:41.800 --> 34:46.560]  atmosphere forever changing the makeup of our atmosphere proposals and they're
[34:46.560 --> 34:49.680]  doing it they're testing it and now they've had hearings on regulation as
[34:49.680 --> 34:53.920]  you'll hear in the clip but they've decided not to ban that testing there's
[34:53.920 --> 34:58.440]  currently no regulation over geoengineering testing and they really
[34:58.440 --> 35:01.560]  aren't telling us that much about what's going on let's cue the rest of that
[35:01.560 --> 35:06.720]  clip now spraying God knows what up there we know what some of it is a lot of
[35:06.720 --> 35:11.120]  its aluminum and sulfur deoxide and the rest of it but they've created this
[35:11.120 --> 35:14.880]  rationale that's going to solve global warming now let's go that's just their
[35:14.880 --> 35:18.240]  cover they always denied it till three years ago now they go we were doing it
[35:18.240 --> 35:22.880]  but it's sacred it's the same for the earth where we're peace next we're peace
[35:22.880 --> 35:28.600]  prize winners yeah and they admit one of the leading researchers of this whole
[35:28.600 --> 35:32.640]  geoengineering thing is David Keith and he's got a paper explaining how the
[35:32.640 --> 35:37.640]  cloud seeding for the US and for the Soviet Union goes back to the 20s and we
[35:37.640 --> 35:41.600]  have clips I know from Ben Livingston if we want to play this is Ben Livingston
[35:41.600 --> 35:45.280]  who was the father of weather weapons and I saw in a little blurb in an article
[35:45.280 --> 35:49.400]  and they declassified that in the mid 60s they'd certified Stanford and he'd done
[35:49.400 --> 35:53.440]  it as meteorologist this is a guy like World War two flying to Typhoons I mean
[35:53.440 --> 35:56.880]  he's a real trailblazer it's like almost I think it was 90 on Airbnb I think he's
[35:56.880 --> 36:01.840]  still alive but as like six years ago and you know the point with Livingston was
[36:01.840 --> 36:07.200]  they could control, steer, create hurricanes in the 60s so it just shows
[36:07.200 --> 36:12.640]  how far this stuff's come let's go ahead and go to that clip. My name is Ben
[36:12.640 --> 36:17.960]  Livingston I'm the first person to ever see the cloud with the intention to
[36:17.960 --> 36:22.640]  call it to do military damage I know I can say that and I did it several times
[36:22.640 --> 36:27.680]  before the next person did it. We were doing quite a lot of testing work out over the
[36:27.680 --> 36:34.320]  test range at Channel 8 California where we dropped cloud seeding flares or
[36:34.320 --> 36:39.480]  silver iodide generators into clouds or it's where we wanted to see what the
[36:39.480 --> 36:45.360]  reaction was and it was there when I learned for sure that you could really
[36:45.360 --> 36:50.280]  change a cloud by the amount of silver iodide you put in it and where you put it.
[36:50.280 --> 36:59.240]  These are cloud seeding dispensing units on the side of C-130s as you can see
[36:59.240 --> 37:09.560]  that these dispensers held 52 units. We were the first ones to fly into
[37:09.560 --> 37:13.960]  hurricanes for the purpose of modifying them if you will that was product storm
[37:13.960 --> 37:20.600]  fury. I began to be extremely confident that we could to do whatever about what
[37:20.600 --> 37:24.680]  we wanted to do with a hurricane. The product storm fury had been going on
[37:24.680 --> 37:32.200]  since 1961 and they had already done or had done two experiments one in 61 and
[37:32.200 --> 37:41.360]  63 well by 1964 when I was there in 1964 I wrote the plan and started to have a
[37:41.360 --> 37:46.680]  track and a mission for every flight that was on the hurricane cloud seeding
[37:46.680 --> 37:52.760]  experiments so we had documentation for everything. Operation the product storm fury
[37:52.760 --> 38:00.880]  very positive. This report said that we claim they should consider now. Okay
[38:00.880 --> 38:05.320]  that's just a short excerpt from an interview I did six years ago with Ben
[38:05.320 --> 38:11.000]  Levich to the father of weather weapons. We're just demonstrating this exists the
[38:11.000 --> 38:16.320]  cloud seeding how they do it moving right along back to Aaron Dykes because
[38:16.320 --> 38:20.440]  this is all going on and you're supposed to just worry about football all day or
[38:20.440 --> 38:26.160]  what Lindsay Lohan's doing I'm sorry because what they admit their spraying is
[38:26.160 --> 38:29.920]  brain damaging the population is neurological disorders go off the
[38:29.920 --> 38:35.320]  charts as the honey bees die you name it. Aaron Dykes continue with your report
[38:35.320 --> 38:39.560]  while we show some footage of videos we were sent from around the world of the
[38:39.560 --> 38:43.440]  geoengineering program. But Alex you said this is brain damage I guess remember
[38:43.440 --> 38:47.480]  this is all for global warming it's for our own good and so you've got all these
[38:47.480 --> 38:52.080]  seemingly wacky proposals to shoot air balloons that spray stuff in the
[38:52.080 --> 38:55.840]  atmosphere to have little ships that float on the ocean and spray stuff in
[38:55.840 --> 39:00.680]  the atmosphere to put a hose up into the atmosphere to have solar reflective
[39:00.680 --> 39:05.480]  things and and orbiting the earth and outer space. They're just setting the
[39:05.480 --> 39:09.200]  pressure to take control weather. Yeah and you've heard them talk about how they
[39:09.200 --> 39:13.560]  want to control the space for the 21st century flight this is all part of that
[39:13.560 --> 39:17.640]  it's cloaked on a national security in this global warming excuse and among
[39:17.640 --> 39:22.680]  their other crazy plans is this Albedo's plan to inject particles into the
[39:22.680 --> 39:26.680]  atmosphere and the stratosphere to reflect the radiation. Now that alone
[39:26.680 --> 39:31.360]  will cause a disruption with the radiation forcing which will change the
[39:31.360 --> 39:34.880]  weather perhaps in unpredictable ways they know that but they're still
[39:34.880 --> 39:38.840]  pursuing it because it's. There's only one part they've got the magnetic field
[39:38.840 --> 39:42.880]  generators they now admit and in China and Dubai other places that are just
[39:42.880 --> 39:46.360]  copies of harp that are energizing the atmosphere. But naturally people have
[39:46.360 --> 39:50.800]  seen the stuff sprayed into the sky ask questions about it and as they're
[39:50.800 --> 39:54.880]  proving correctly want to know more well it all falls under this Albedo's plan I
[39:54.880 --> 39:59.040]  know we have all these clips here about global dimming and about how shooting
[39:59.040 --> 40:03.800]  sulfur into the atmosphere is going to help that process and it goes on from
[40:03.800 --> 40:08.800]  there. But isn't it more trendy just to be an acting cool I mean why should we
[40:08.800 --> 40:12.520]  even worry about this oh here's some more articles yeah the solar shield now
[40:12.520 --> 40:16.640]  that we've exposed this oh we are doing it we're saving you we've just been
[40:16.640 --> 40:21.440]  testing it. Yeah and they're doing it here you see Bill Gates he not only
[40:21.440 --> 40:26.560]  wants to steer hurricanes but he's funding the plan to shoot stuff into the
[40:26.560 --> 40:31.160]  atmosphere. None of us have the right to not breathe this because the
[40:31.160 --> 40:35.120]  little control freak chicken neck eugenicist who daddy runs Planned
[40:35.120 --> 40:38.600]  Parenthood says we're gonna breathe it. So you see again and again academic
[40:38.600 --> 40:43.120]  papers about modifying clouds creating artificial clouds you can read them for
[40:43.120 --> 40:48.320]  yourself you've got a preventing global warming by increasing cloud Albedo. This
[40:48.320 --> 40:51.560]  is just a few selections because as you saw there's literally hundreds of
[40:51.560 --> 40:56.600]  documents but here Paul Krutz and he won a Nobel Prize and he's very much of the
[40:56.600 --> 40:59.760]  forefront of this whole thing he's talking about Albedo enhancement
[40:59.760 --> 41:03.720]  their stratospheric sulfur injection admits they're going to shoot sulfur
[41:03.720 --> 41:07.880]  particles into the stratosphere and atmosphere to try to cool the planet and
[41:07.880 --> 41:12.200]  that's one of the main proposals that's tied to this spraying from the planes
[41:12.200 --> 41:17.400]  because you've also got this one from Jay Gorman about how the stratosphere
[41:17.400 --> 41:22.600]  injection of aerosols can be done with fuel additives aviation fuel additives
[41:22.600 --> 41:26.960]  the paper describes the selection and preliminary testing of chemicals that
[41:26.960 --> 41:30.120]  might be used as aviation fuel additives to inject these products
[41:30.120 --> 41:35.080]  sulfur dioxide and micron-sized silica particles into the stratosphere from
[41:35.080 --> 41:38.920]  commercial or military aircraft they admit they're testing it and when it's
[41:38.920 --> 41:42.840]  tested they have this whole program they call testing well when is it coming up
[41:42.840 --> 41:45.520]  where they admit they mix it with the jet fuel the patents this is the one
[41:45.520 --> 41:49.760]  right here atmospheric testing could be started almost immediately separately
[41:49.760 --> 41:53.800]  there's other patents where they kind of sketch out ways that they can mix
[41:53.800 --> 41:58.480]  powder and create contrails such as this one guys let's hit pause on that
[41:58.480 --> 42:02.200]  incredible job Aaron you've really overdone it as usual you're calling this
[42:02.200 --> 42:05.760]  just the tip of the iceberg this is quite an iceberg yeah here's some of the
[42:05.760 --> 42:09.720]  patents on the jet engine how it disperses the sulfur dioxide the aluminum
[42:09.720 --> 42:14.400]  dioxide so you can enjoy the massive increases in neurological disorders now
[42:14.400 --> 42:19.560]  plugging everyone and this is an infowars article from a year just about a
[42:19.560 --> 42:28.240]  year ago back last December and then it lists all the patents 16191832045865
[42:28.240 --> 42:32.520]  I mean folks don't don't think there's literally a couple hundred patents don't
[42:32.520 --> 42:36.840]  don't listen spend your time I know TV said it was a conspiracy theory once
[42:36.840 --> 42:42.320]  you go to the US government patent office I mean really learn but then
[42:42.320 --> 42:45.120]  people are gonna nickel and dime that this wasn't the one they chose to go
[42:45.120 --> 42:48.640]  with the point is they have massive amounts of researchers the point is they
[42:48.640 --> 42:52.880]  admit they're testing it when we learn the name of the of the passive aerosol
[42:52.880 --> 42:57.200]  program we found out it's huge it's going on all line that was 15 16 years ago
[42:57.200 --> 43:01.880]  trails didn't sit there all day they had met our earth's dimming from this let's
[43:01.880 --> 43:06.120]  continue hurry there's so much more well there is a whole lot more and we have
[43:06.120 --> 43:10.520]  right now a clip from John P. Holdren the Obama White House advisor and then
[43:10.520 --> 43:14.080]  for Paul Crutz and the guy who won a Nobel Prize for helping to push this
[43:14.080 --> 43:17.360]  minute but have we covered this global dimming plan yet yeah we just played
[43:17.360 --> 43:21.680]  mostly let's play Holdren and the loving Nobel Prize winner this is the current
[43:21.680 --> 43:25.600]  White House science are they come up with this in the early 90s they
[43:25.600 --> 43:28.840]  implement it right away with your tax money a bunch of control freaks playing
[43:28.840 --> 43:32.560]  God here it is we have to keep geoengineering on the table we have to
[43:32.560 --> 43:36.640]  look at it very carefully because we might get desperate enough to want to
[43:36.640 --> 43:40.720]  use it the danger of course with geoengineering is the one I was
[43:40.720 --> 43:44.360]  referring to a moment ago we don't understand the system well enough to
[43:44.360 --> 43:49.120]  predict its responses in detail in the first place we have to reduce the
[43:49.120 --> 43:54.040]  emissions of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and what can we do then is
[43:54.040 --> 44:00.760]  that is the case then maybe we are forced to do something in the stratosphere
[44:00.760 --> 44:04.280]  and that is to deposit sulfur in the stratosphere
[44:04.280 --> 44:08.720]  sulfur particles in sulfate containing particles in the atmosphere
[44:08.720 --> 44:15.720]  that will reflect solar radiation that will cool the earth and
[44:15.720 --> 44:19.960]  artificially we can think of bringing sulfur in the stratosphere at altitude
[44:19.960 --> 44:26.080]  of 25 kilometers where they then would lead to sulfur particles formation and
[44:26.080 --> 44:31.800]  cooling of the earth incredible Aaron they bring up this made up crap about
[44:31.800 --> 44:35.640]  global warming or any climate change is unusual and it's really just their
[44:35.640 --> 44:38.880]  excuse when you get deeper in the documents for weather warfare against
[44:38.880 --> 44:43.560]  the third world but just like Obama's the peace president waging war it's just a
[44:43.560 --> 44:47.440]  total cover story yeah I mean for example they were going to shoot laser
[44:47.440 --> 44:52.600]  particles to blast away the CFCs back in the eight late 80s and stuff I mean take
[44:52.600 --> 44:56.800]  for example this out of port and down where somebody wrote asking about the
[44:56.800 --> 45:01.680]  open air release of zinc cadmium sulfide in the 50s and 60s and they say yeah
[45:01.680 --> 45:06.680]  we're sorry but the military reserves the right to open air tests really
[45:06.680 --> 45:11.440]  anything they please that's US code title 50 chapter 32 subsection 1520 a
[45:11.440 --> 45:15.120]  let's show a document cam of this here's over in England they go yeah we
[45:15.120 --> 45:22.080]  spray deadly stuff on you yeah we spray deadly stuff on you suck it die we fry
[45:22.080 --> 45:28.840]  little foster kids and microwave ovens you bet now die sheep pay that tax money
[45:28.840 --> 45:33.040]  we love you you don't love us you're a terrorist yeah and so now we got this
[45:33.040 --> 45:36.640]  whole global warming thing falling apart at the seams the cover stories busted
[45:36.640 --> 45:40.920]  on that but they still want to push this geoengineering thing as a solution to a
[45:40.920 --> 45:44.840]  problem a lot of people know is phony now the whole point is they've had had
[45:44.840 --> 45:49.520]  hearings in the US in the UK on regulating it and they all call for
[45:49.520 --> 45:54.000]  global solution and it's all mirrored off of the same proposals that funneled
[45:54.000 --> 45:57.720]  through the council and foreign relations through various universities back on
[45:57.720 --> 46:01.840]  the 60s yeah and a handful of scientists like David Keith and Ken Caldera have
[46:01.840 --> 46:05.040]  been steering this through all the different science groups getting
[46:05.040 --> 46:09.720]  hearings but always just pushing for let them test do not ban and let's have
[46:09.720 --> 46:14.680]  global coordination let's keep the clip now where the Holdren plan correlates
[46:14.680 --> 46:20.680]  with the CFR plan Obama science chief eyes drastic climate steps thank goodness
[46:20.680 --> 46:23.680]  he's there to save us of course he says he wants to reduce world population by
[46:23.680 --> 46:28.280]  at least 80% and put chemicals in the water sterilizes Obama's planted geo
[46:28.280 --> 46:33.320]  engineer the planet mirror CFR policy documents but aren't we lucky we have
[46:33.320 --> 46:39.400]  these guys I mean he says he wants to kill us it's very nice of him though but I
[46:39.400 --> 46:43.280]  guess he can't kill himself yet because he has to carry out the plan first it's
[46:43.280 --> 46:47.120]  very nice of him though and he's so incredible with Bill Gates and there's
[46:47.120 --> 46:50.240]  the CFR plan you know lateral engineering these are the same plans with
[46:50.240 --> 46:54.160]  everyone shoot reflective particles in the upper atmosphere add more clouds in
[46:54.160 --> 46:58.920]  the lower atmosphere place reflective objects in space extremely expensive and
[46:58.920 --> 47:01.840]  stupid but then we're not supposed to notice any of this going on the change
[47:01.840 --> 47:07.000]  the the terraform of the earth change the the shading of things on the earth
[47:07.000 --> 47:10.680]  like I noticed Aaron the old-timers 18 years ago did the testing in the
[47:10.680 --> 47:13.920]  atmosphere and said these exact chemicals and they were proven right and
[47:13.920 --> 47:17.600]  it's going on and they are skidding dimmer and the neurological disorders are
[47:17.600 --> 47:21.600]  going up and we've covered in our report that Paul did all the universities
[47:21.600 --> 47:25.240]  people saying aluminum is going up we don't know why and all the soil and then
[47:25.240 --> 47:28.400]  after we expose all this they go yeah we're doing it for the earth but the
[47:28.400 --> 47:31.120]  details are classified but that's good if they done the earth they're more
[47:31.120 --> 47:34.480]  intelligent than we exactly well they know they like to kill us I mean they
[47:34.480 --> 47:38.640]  said so we're scum yeah they're really killing us but it's kind of a nice little
[47:38.640 --> 47:41.760]  thing they're saving us here and they but that's the gravy I think is you've
[47:41.760 --> 47:45.200]  had stuff like you're not loving like there's an itch among others wrote the
[47:45.200 --> 47:51.400]  bill back in 2001 you know calling to ban and restrict exotic weapons including
[47:51.400 --> 47:55.560]  high frequency weapons that allegedly also didn't exist at one point as well
[47:55.560 --> 47:59.000]  as quote chemtrails the little bus we did show the defense secretary admitting
[47:59.000 --> 48:02.520]  they have them but now they are holding hearings on geoengineering which does
[48:02.520 --> 48:06.280]  exist officially now and they're telling us how good it will be when they
[48:06.280 --> 48:11.880]  regulated globally Alex either using the the the places that already exist
[48:11.880 --> 48:15.520]  through the United Nations or creating a new address smiling face on its loving
[48:15.520 --> 48:20.880]  well if we could play the clips now about the international global accords to
[48:20.880 --> 48:25.680]  hold hearings on geoengineering government report calls for global
[48:25.680 --> 48:29.800]  authority on planetary geoengineering that was Steve Watson reporting on it at
[48:29.800 --> 48:33.920]  present planet and it just gets into all these hearings there's the actual
[48:33.920 --> 48:38.600]  report yeah this one's from the UK the House of Commons regulating geoengineering
[48:38.600 --> 48:41.920]  sounds like they're really gonna do something about it they're gonna make
[48:41.920 --> 48:45.080]  sure their land is pressed with one they go on to explain how they have a joint
[48:45.080 --> 48:48.680]  agreement with the US and that their committees have gotten together and
[48:48.680 --> 48:52.760]  agreed on geoengineering they recognize there could be dangers of course Alex
[48:52.760 --> 48:57.280]  but they need an international regulatory arrangement for geoengineering as
[48:57.280 --> 49:01.600]  you could see here and make it all legal that they're killing us and cutting the
[49:01.600 --> 49:06.760]  water off to Africa and Latin America here how currently it's not subject to
[49:06.760 --> 49:10.360]  regulation they admit there's no regulation to the testing going on right
[49:10.360 --> 49:14.040]  now that means they're doing it Alex if you read between no they admit they've
[49:14.040 --> 49:17.160]  been doing the testing you can pull up thousands of reports of it but again
[49:17.160 --> 49:21.520]  you're you none of these documents exist it's all a pipe dream but here's the
[49:21.520 --> 49:28.200]  the regulations more international regulation between the the US UK deal
[49:28.200 --> 49:32.080]  here's from the House of Commons they talk about the trends boundary
[49:32.080 --> 49:35.880]  implications of dealing with these new technology of our said we'll just you
[49:35.880 --> 49:40.000]  get a lateral global yeah well they'll do both they got drones bombing everybody
[49:40.000 --> 49:44.560]  anyways and countries killing them I mean why not they can't ban it or create
[49:44.560 --> 49:47.760]  a regulatory framework because the technology is not sufficiently
[49:47.760 --> 49:52.120]  predictable and they they explained to how cloud seeding will be included in
[49:52.120 --> 49:55.640]  this and they're gonna have to come up with a legalese definition for geo
[49:55.640 --> 50:00.240]  engineering and again what I'm showing is different reports that all call for
[50:00.240 --> 50:04.280]  international agreements this one out of the Congressional Research Service they
[50:04.280 --> 50:08.080]  had all kinds of different this goes on in the real world and then we're all
[50:08.080 --> 50:13.080]  supposed to watch CNN and Fox and here Glenn Beck make fun of us and tell us
[50:13.080 --> 50:16.600]  none of that exists kind of like there wasn't a bank of the world or a CFR
[50:16.600 --> 50:20.800]  or Bilderberg group now they admit it all but the global governments to save us
[50:20.800 --> 50:24.920]  Aaron run by the very banks that implemented it all and of course you
[50:24.920 --> 50:28.320]  know who's pushing on the genetically modified crops the stuff that
[50:28.320 --> 50:32.720]  sterilize all the animals that eat them and we see our fertility dropping but
[50:32.720 --> 50:35.800]  again these are nice people I mean they openly write papers about how they want
[50:35.800 --> 50:39.360]  to kill us okay we're gonna be back on the other side I'll break down some of
[50:39.360 --> 50:43.640]  things I didn't get to cover and maybe point out how they've got to be
[50:43.640 --> 50:47.480]  criminally insane on top of all their other motives but we'll get into that
[50:47.480 --> 50:51.720]  and we have censored police state episode clips coming up and we're gonna
[50:51.720 --> 50:55.560]  show how true it has become unfortunately we have to retake this
[50:55.560 --> 51:01.120]  country info wars.com good place to start stay tuned
[51:02.640 --> 51:06.560]  folks have you launched your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get
[51:06.560 --> 51:10.360]  the lights back on if so this is going to be the most important message you'll
[51:10.360 --> 51:14.040]  ever hear because there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter
[51:14.040 --> 51:19.080]  power outages ahead here's why solar power generators are now available from
[51:19.080 --> 51:22.840]  our friends at solutions from science one of our oldest sponsors their
[51:22.840 --> 51:26.600]  emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you
[51:26.600 --> 51:31.200]  need it most unlike gas generators a solar generator runs quietly amidst no
[51:31.200 --> 51:35.360]  fumes and produces electricity from the Sun it's like having an electric power
[51:35.360 --> 51:39.760]  plant running quietly in your own own whether it's ice storms brownouts or
[51:39.760 --> 51:43.880]  blackouts you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again when
[51:43.880 --> 51:48.040]  the power goes out this winter you'll be ready with a solar power generator from

[54:22.120 --> 54:32.640]  This is infowars.com and we are doing our dam business to cover information they
[54:32.640 --> 54:37.600]  won't touch with a whatever foot pole in the mainstream media or anywhere else
[54:37.600 --> 54:41.840]  for that matter now there's so much information I can't claim to be a total
[54:41.840 --> 54:46.360]  scientific expert on every level of things but I know when something is a
[54:46.360 --> 54:50.280]  lie I know when there's a cover story going on and that's what I personally
[54:50.280 --> 54:54.200]  tried to break down in the geoengineering if I'm able to make any
[54:54.200 --> 54:57.720]  contribution among the other great researchers who've been trying to analyze
[54:57.720 --> 55:01.560]  what's going on with what's being sprayed in the skies and the rest of it and
[55:01.560 --> 55:06.200]  it directly overlaps with this politically motivated science
[55:06.200 --> 55:11.360]  agenda to geoengineer the planet in the name of global warming now obviously
[55:11.360 --> 55:18.160]  there is a huge overlapping cartel of related defense military science and
[55:18.160 --> 55:22.840]  banking interest going on you see the nexus of it at groups like Bilderberg and
[55:22.840 --> 55:26.920]  the Council on Foreign Relations you see a strong manifestation in it in
[55:26.920 --> 55:32.520]  genetically engineered crop companies like Monsanto just think how much
[55:32.520 --> 55:37.240]  correlation there is between the Rockefeller Foundation the Gates
[55:37.240 --> 55:43.240]  Foundation and the acceptance of GMO crops in places like Africa where they've
[55:43.240 --> 55:47.240]  set up initiatives to push them they've come up with drought resistant crops the
[55:47.240 --> 55:52.680]  same foundations and the same billionaire individuals Bill Gates chief among
[55:52.680 --> 55:56.600]  them who have a stake in the global seed vault who have a stake in weather
[55:56.600 --> 56:02.320]  modification in cloud seeding and hurricane steering the same individuals
[56:02.320 --> 56:07.120]  who have a stake in population control and attempt to depopulate the planet who
[56:07.120 --> 56:11.600]  have a stake in vaccinations and all kinds of other weird science fiction
[56:11.600 --> 56:16.960]  rationales and I attempted to frame this entire issue around the admissions the
[56:16.960 --> 56:24.120]  predictions the the anticipations of Lord Bertrand Russell who explained how
[56:24.120 --> 56:27.920]  there would be different sets of education for the rulers and ruled
[56:27.920 --> 56:32.600]  obviously that would imply also different explanations of what really goes on in
[56:32.600 --> 56:37.560]  the world and what is happening and that is what we see here today now just in
[56:37.560 --> 56:43.920]  the years 2009 2010 you finally had the UK and the House of Commons of the United
[56:43.920 --> 56:49.400]  States through various congressional vehicles and other research vehicles
[56:49.400 --> 56:53.720]  hearings on geoengineering this one at the House of Commons called the
[56:53.720 --> 56:57.400]  regulation of geoengineering really sounds like they're going to try to put
[56:57.400 --> 57:02.400]  a lid on things and maybe prevent science and research from going overboard
[57:02.400 --> 57:08.080]  crossing the line opening more Pandora's boxes but are they if you look in the
[57:08.080 --> 57:12.640]  report you really see how they acknowledge there's no current restrictions
[57:12.640 --> 57:17.920]  on testing repeat there is no current regulation of geoengineering Kim
[57:17.920 --> 57:21.400]  Charles spring or whatever else you want to call it whatever else might be
[57:21.400 --> 57:25.920]  going on furthermore they make it sound all nice and neat that they need
[57:25.920 --> 57:31.480]  regulation but what they want to do is narrowly define the term geoengineering
[57:31.480 --> 57:36.440]  under a politically expedient rationale for instance they want to exclude
[57:36.440 --> 57:41.200]  cloud seeding and other sort of like normalized weather modification programs
[57:41.200 --> 57:45.760]  and I would imagine they would also steer clear of things the public has not
[57:45.760 --> 57:50.120]  as much understanding on harp type technologies and other things which
[57:50.120 --> 57:54.240]  they've also said doesn't exist just as with the Kim trailing and yet it does
[57:54.240 --> 57:58.360]  exist we're just not meant to know about it or to acknowledge it publicly
[57:58.360 --> 58:02.720]  especially but when you research it you see it is going on in the House of
[58:02.720 --> 58:06.960]  Commons there was a joint agreement as you saw in the video I beg of you to
[58:06.960 --> 58:10.200]  pause the video look up the articles read them for yourself get your own
[58:10.200 --> 58:16.560]  understanding they want to set up a global mechanism to quote regulate
[58:16.560 --> 58:19.320]  geoengineering while allowing it to go forward because it's such a good idea
[58:19.320 --> 58:23.120]  for global warming that's all the time we have in this segment but stay tuned
[58:23.120 --> 58:26.760]  we're gonna cover censored police state information on the other side FEMA
[58:26.760 --> 58:30.720]  camps and more it's all coming true Homeland Security is coming down on us
[58:30.720 --> 58:34.560]  we must fight back on the other side we're gonna play some bombshell clips
[58:34.560 --> 58:44.800]  they didn't want to air but it did and for worse dot com this is GCN the
[58:44.800 --> 58:52.080]  Genesis communications radio network this is Alex Jones with five good
[58:52.080 --> 58:56.080]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[58:56.080 --> 58:59.880]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[58:59.880 --> 59:03.960]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[59:03.960 --> 59:08.200]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the
[59:08.200 --> 59:12.480]  name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[59:12.480 --> 59:16.440]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[59:16.440 --> 59:20.600]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[59:20.600 --> 59:24.560]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[59:24.560 --> 59:28.720]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[59:28.720 --> 59:32.520]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[59:32.520 --> 59:36.000]  power generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors
[59:36.000 --> 59:41.200]  you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar
[59:41.200 --> 59:45.440]  backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar
[59:45.440 --> 59:51.600]  backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[59:51.600 --> 01:00:04.720]  Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:12.360]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:19.880]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:23.360]  Alex Jones
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:35.520]  it is the second hour on this November 17 broadcast the Alex Jones show I'm
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:40.640]  Aaron Dykes honored to sit in now we are expecting Alex to pop in sometime
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:44.280]  later in the broadcast but right now you really want to tune in if you miss the
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:48.560]  chemtrails geoengineering special you want to find that at info wars.com or
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:52.960]  where it's easiest to get at prismplant.tv for subscribers you can get
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:01:00.440]  that right now on a free trial check it out see how good it is I do what yeah and
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:04.200]  or you could just find it somewhere on the internet share it with people
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:09.640]  analyze it but also stay tuned for this a censored broadcast of something many of
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:14.320]  you listeners have already seen but look at it again look how true it is now and
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:19.160]  that is just even sure as conspiracy theory episode of police state which
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:23.720]  covered FEMA camps and the whole gamut of the federalized takeover it's an
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:27.400]  episode that got very angry about there was a lot of behind-the-scenes pressure
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:32.600]  as you'll hear Alex intro in the clips pointing out and they stopped this
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:37.400]  episode from re-airing they re-air all the episodes as part of the ability to
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:41.400]  regain money and recoup the cost and everything and it also draws in more
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:45.540]  viewers over time they re-air all the other episodes as hard-hitting as they
[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:50.240]  were but they blocked this when they even went so far as to work with the
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:54.560]  cable companies we're talking about the feds your homeland security we're talking
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:58.200]  about Congress people getting upset about this episode airing and the
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:03.160]  information it laid out and you saw cable companies literally delete the
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:08.520]  episode from the listings literally delete it from the repeat rebroadcast
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:14.600]  re-airing episodes in the listings you also saw the recorded DVR boxes
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:18.880]  suddenly we had multiple reports enough to collaborate that this was going on
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:23.680]  and we saw it on our own DVR boxes that this police state episode was deleted
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:27.680]  from where you can save episodes record them to your hard drive and they've
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:30.840]  tried to wipe it out and you could still find it online and share it with
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:35.320]  people but what we've done here is try to strip away the kind of packaging and
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:38.800]  repeating things that you have to do on TV to bring people back in from
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:42.800]  commercials and the rest of it and we tried to boil it down to some of the
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:46.040]  most essential information of course we can't air it all but we're going to play
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:49.520]  some really important clips here and look how true it is they've got TSA
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:54.040]  knowingly you know with cancer fears over these scanners but they go forward
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:58.840]  you've got these viper checkpoints now expanding on highways you got homeland
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:03.520]  security coordinating with police and mayors to crack down on Occupy Wall Street
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:08.760]  protests and as you well know that is just the tip of the iceberg there's so
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:14.560]  much else going on we broke the Mayak homeland security reports two different
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:18.520]  reports they're both targeting politically motivated groups returning
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:22.960]  veterans and a whole lot more constitutionalists as potential homeland
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:27.800]  terrorists you've seen the whole thing shift from the shadowy enemies somewhere
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:32.600]  in the Muslim world to a crackdown on American people a paranoia about what
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:36.400]  they're going to be a part of and you know Jesse Ventura has put his money
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:40.560]  where his mouth is he tried to sue the TSA and he got so mad when they wouldn't
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:45.360]  even let him have a jury trial wouldn't let that come to surface so please watch
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:50.000]  this episode watch the clips that are stripped down to the bear information
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.880]  and get it out to people you know let them know that this was predicted at
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:59.040]  least a year ago by Ventura Alex consulted on it really helped get him
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:03.720]  good information and look how true it has all come down to we're going to play
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:08.920]  those clips in large portion on the other side of this broadcast but we have
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:13.800]  headlines today like TSA backs off of independent x-ray scanner safety test
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:19.720]  knowing that the truth came out in 1998 and so they have reports as far back as
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:24.720]  1998 revealing that the TSA's x-ray scanners could cause around a hundred
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:29.840]  cases of cancer per year conservatively and yet you have former homeland
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:34.800]  security chief Michael Chertoff lobbing for the body scanners and look what the
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:39.760]  pretext was the so-called underwear bomber now they've expanded that pretext
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:43.720]  in the highway checkpoints random checkpoints because somebody might do
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:47.840]  something somewhere it's outrageous they're trying to control the American
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:50.720]  population and a whole lot more stay tuned we're going to get into those

[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:23.360]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:27.720]  citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:33.000]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on

[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:40.760]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the

[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:19.960]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:41.200]  Alex Jones we're back on the Alex Jones show here in the first long segment of
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:45.120]  the second hour and if you just joined us we have a special representation of
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:50.440]  the police state FEMA camp episode they tried to censor from television so the
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:53.840]  boobs would not catch on to what's going on those of us who've been
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:57.480]  researching alternative information know it's all too real that the
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:01.600]  federalization is creeping in that the police state is creeping in that they
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:06.520]  don't just want you know outrageous activity at the airports checking us
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:09.800]  as though we're all common criminals they also want checkpoints on the
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:14.320]  highways and it's all coming to ahead it's coming to fruition they're gonna
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:19.120]  check trains bus terminals passengers on the streets all kinds of stuff it's
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:23.120]  happening and you've seen the news articles about it now we're gonna air
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:27.560]  the presentation the Jesse Ventura and the conspiracy theory show put together
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:32.320]  large clips of it so you can see how accurately it was predicted and I didn't
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:36.160]  know about the stuff either till I worked with Alex and then he pointed me
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:40.040]  towards a lot of the research and it's just amazing the stuff that's going on
[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:44.800]  there's a reason that the founders of the Constitution as imperfect as this
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:49.400]  country or its design ever was tried to separate powers tried to balance them
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:53.840]  tried to bind down the normal tyranny that comes out of men and their powers
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:57.960]  through the chains of the Constitution there's a reason that took place and it's
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:01.520]  all come undone with this homeland security federalization whether it's
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:05.600]  law enforcement or lawmaking you never want the power in so few hands so we
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:10.640]  now have with the Super Congress I take you now to the clips of police state on
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:14.120]  conspiracy theory with Jesse Ventura from last season as well as Alex's
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:23.440]  commentary on it a year ago November 2010 Jesse Ventura premiered his
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:31.800]  police state episode on true TV to a giant audience normally they re-air the
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:36.820]  TV episodes over and over again at least 50 times over the next year that's how
[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:43.040]  they recoup those $600,000 or so that it takes to make each episode the
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:46.800]  previous season's episodes that all aired over and over again last season's
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:51.800]  episodes have aired over and over again but not this one episode and we're
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:58.640]  about to air here today large chunks of it because the information contained in
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:05.440]  this censored information breaks down the full spectrum of federal takeover
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:12.160]  we're seeing and it's through the expose of this information that we can stop the
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:15.960]  military industrial complex control of the megabanks from taking over our
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:20.920]  society Congress covertly homeland security you name it put pressure on
[01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:27.960]  Time Warner that owns true TV to make sure this was never seen again I have
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:31.720]  been sworn to secrecy by members of the crew and others about some of the
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:36.200]  harassment and things that they went through and as a journalist when I'm
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:42.720]  sworn to secrecy I won't talk about it but it is life and death I'll sleep at
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:48.240]  that the system doesn't want the public to see credible former FBI agents
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:53.160]  blowing the whistle on a martial law police state control grid takeover that
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:58.480]  you're about to see they don't want you to think about these issues they want
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:02.160]  you to believe that America is still operating the way it always did they
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:05.120]  don't want you to know that foreign megabanks have come in and hijacked the
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:08.920]  country and have turned the police and military to a great extent against the
[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:14.800]  population they don't want modern Paul reveres to be able to warn people you know
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:18.600]  the night that this actually aired I had privately told Ventura that I didn't
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:21.960]  think it would air I called him at home and I called his son Tyrell and I said
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:25.840]  congratulations I can't believe that just aired I am truly proud of the fact
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:30.480]  that this aired and then a few days later they were told it's not gonna air
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:36.200]  again and that Congress and Homeland Security were very very upset I know
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:41.080]  why the congressman that sponsored the emergency centers establishment act who
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:45.360]  claimed that none of it existed until he was confronted with it was basically
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:52.800]  destroyed in the interview and revealed as the arrogant disinformation
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:57.320]  operative that he is and that's another reason the system at the panic button
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:03.200]  they know the people first after Liberty they know the people want freedom
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:07.440]  and they're attempting to use foreign outside threats as the pretext to take
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:10.760]  our liberties here domestically when it's on record that those foreign threats
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:15.360]  were manufactured and funded and are controlled by the criminal banking cartel
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:23.120]  that is seized control of this nation so I give you large segments of the
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:28.760]  censored police state FEMA camp concentration camp conspiracy episode
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:37.320]  that big brother doesn't want you to see now the secret government plan to spy
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:49.400]  on round up in prison innocent Americans Jesse Ventura uncovers a plot to force
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:54.520]  martial law on law-abiding citizens certainly the involvement of the
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:59.120]  military is something that's very concerning replace the 50 states with
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:05.760]  10 giant prison sectors fill up hundreds of concentration camps with people
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:13.120]  like you and me residential centers with fences because they're designed to
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:20.280]  hold whole families and pull the trigger with a disease pandemic there's this
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:28.080]  massive preparation literal mega death it's not a fantasy the wheels are in
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:35.120]  motion and politicians are passing laws to steal our freedoms and protect the
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:40.480]  elite I'm here to talk to you about these FEMA camps they don't exist so why
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:46.680]  was it put into that bill before it's too late Jesse Ventura cuts through the
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:54.480]  laser wire storms the prisons and blasts open the American concentration camp
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:15:11.840]  conspiracy Madison Georgia Jesse Ventura's investigation of a police state
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:17.000]  conspiracy has led him here after weeks of traveling to sites of alleged
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:22.240]  concentration camps for innocent citizens he's arrived at the most chilling
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:37.000]  display of all it's hundreds of thousands of coffins and if they had to
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:42.200]  get rid of people or dissidents they got the caskets for it don't they yes and
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:46.000]  we found stockpiles all over the country
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:52.160]  yeah governor there are 72 of these fusion centers around the country yeah as I understand
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:57.960]  that they coordinate information from the CIA to the FBI to the state police as
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:01.080]  well as the local police the biggest problem with all of this is there's no
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:05.440]  oversight and did you know they've been sued they're supposed to be watching for
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:09.640]  terrorists but they've actually gone after protesters yeah even conspiracy
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:14.280]  theorists conspiracy theorists yes even conspiracy theorists Obama's regulatory
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:18.400]  stock has Sunstein has written a paper saying that conspiracy theorists should
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:22.840]  be banned altogether obviously there's a lot more to this I want to know
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:27.520]  everything about these fusion centers brilliant I'm on it and get me a flight
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:34.400]  to DC immediately got it everyone that leads to chase I had a source in the
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:41.520]  capital Mike German spent 16 years as an FBI special agent infiltrating terror
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:48.880]  cells and preventing acts of terrorism before 9-11 a few years after 9-11 he
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:54.520]  got so fed up with the follow-ups and abuses within the bureau he quit now
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:59.600]  he's focused on reigning in those fusion centers they developed in such a
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:03.920]  secrecy with no guidelines and no oversight so the public really has no
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:09.040]  way to hold these institutions accountable no guidelines no oversight
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:15.400]  bad enough but it's what he told me next that really made my blood boil where
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:19.320]  they start collecting things that aren't necessarily reasonably associated with
[01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:27.160]  criminality that's where the problem started in some programs even
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:32.720]  expressing extreme views well wait who plays God here on the definition of
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:38.160]  what's an extreme view when we first produced a report in 2007 about this
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:41.920]  there were 42 fusion centers now they're more than 72 so they're growing very
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:45.640]  rapidly what's the reason for the secrecy on their part there's obviously a
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:49.240]  very unfortunate history with police intelligence activities in the United
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:53.560]  States particularly targeting political groups so I think part of the secrecy was
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:57.920]  to allow this thing to develop before anybody found out much about okay who's
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:04.320]  in charge of it that's the best question out there and the answer is nobody
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:10.240]  that says to me it's ripe for abuse absolutely has there been abuses that
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:14.200]  you know of there have been a number of fusion center reports that if we have
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:18.640]  indicated yes they are targeting groups because of their political police they're
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:24.120]  gonna they're gonna bust you for thinking they're here the thought police now
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:30.960]  you can get arrested for what you believe in what you buy what you read who you
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:37.680]  associate right and they've started a suspicious activity reporting program
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:42.240]  what do we quote and put under suspicious activity some of the behaviors
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:47.400]  are things like photography taking videos drawing diagram taking
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:54.360]  measurements even expressing extreme view originally the suspicious activity
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:58.040]  reporting program was directed at law enforcement so at least they had some
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:01.880]  training into law but now they're actually public programs where they put
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:06.600]  out videos that show planes crashing into towers and say you can prevent this
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:12.440]  by reporting your neighbors profiling anybody and everybody who disagrees with
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:19.720]  big brother I knew the next step only I was hoping I was wrong is this a step
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:23.080]  towards martial law certainly the involvement of the military in these

[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:40.080]  the top down but in the end run around national sovereignty eroding it piece by
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:45.080]  piece will accomplish much more than the old-fashioned frontal assault that it
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:51.200]  was CFR member Richard Gardner in 1974 writing for the CFR journal foreign
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:56.040]  affairs and you could see the strategy of circumventing the Constitution
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:00.720]  circumventing the checks and balances the establishment of the Council of
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:06.640]  Governors the establishment of rule councils with executive branch
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:11.880]  Department of Defense Homeland Security oversight of individual local rule
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:17.120]  affairs taking over this country and the Homeland Security mechanism in
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:22.840]  particular really hijacking law enforcement eroding the concept of local
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:27.720]  accountability and breaking down the whole federalism concept that separated
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:34.600]  state local and federal national government as envisioned by the founders
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:39.640]  of this country and that really is at the heart of this FEMA camp police state
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:43.960]  conspiracy we're going to queue up more clips of that right now but really
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:48.560]  Ventura and his crew did an excellent job of breaking down the information and
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:53.920]  showing how it's the slow takeover Council of Governors only 10 instead of
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:26:00.040]  50 the Super Congress really hijacking the authorities given to Congress and
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:03.520]  the separate houses of Congress and how it has to be checked by the three
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:07.760]  branches of governments all that is being undermined by these policies in
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:12.320]  the name of safety and fighting terrorism let's do more of those clips now so
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:16.120]  Mike these fusion centers they're located everywhere what's one of the big
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:21.940]  ones that you know of well they have a number of big one one of the very
[01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:27.320]  slick productions is the Colorado Fusion Center the Colorado Fusion Center is my
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:34.400]  target I'm on my way doesn't look like much does it but this is Homeland
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:41.080]  Security's crown jewel 55 different agencies use this place as their control
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:47.480]  center for spying on protesters even ordinary delegates outside the 2008
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:54.200]  Democratic National Convention but what else is it up to Lance Clem is the guy
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:27:00.040]  in charge I didn't know you were part of this yeah hit him when they're not
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:05.240]  looking so your main function is gathering intelligence is putting
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:10.600]  together pieces of information Fusion Center means that they take all kinds of
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:15.040]  pieces of information and fuse them together gathering intelligence mayor
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:21.640]  may not be intelligence it also appears to me to be very ripe for abuse this
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:25.800]  technology that you're putting together and how easy could that be used against
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:32.480]  American citizens we don't watch people we do watch trends but our trends people
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:38.080]  not necessarily but they could be they could be we had an occasion to study the
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:43.680]  Fusion Center of Missouri and it came out that they were focusing in on people
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:48.680]  with Ron Paul stickers on their cars right now isn't that going above and
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:53.960]  beyond the call of duty I mean it even showed up conspiracy theorists yep that
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:59.440]  puts me in there would I be under observation by a Fusion Center because
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:05.520]  of my beliefs that I don't always believe not hopefully hopefully not first he
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:10.600]  tells me they just fuse information then he says he hopes they're not watching
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:19.440]  me I think all hope is lost these guys sound out of control we've got documents
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:22.800]  from Missouri and we've got one from Virginia that specifically targets
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:26.760]  African-Americans right or people who are against the state of Israel yeah or
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:30.600]  it's really troubling to see some of you as a particular political slogan on their
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:33.920]  car and all of a sudden they're on a watch list sure of course it is this guy
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:38.360]  isn't even bothering to deny it and that's really dicey well it is dicey
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:44.360]  policies are universal to every Fusion Center do you run each Fusion Center
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:51.120]  separately with these basic policies each one of them is managed separately
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:59.120]  long break however it is important to point out that we've just passively
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:03.440]  accepted all this tracking and tracing technology assuming the promise of new
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:08.000]  science new technology somehow justifies the fact that they plan to use this
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.080]  against the American people and the people of the world we know they have
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:16.400]  prepared for economic riots and many other scenarios internal revolutions and
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:21.280]  the rest of it we know who was behind the Arab Spring why do we think it's any
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:26.000]  different here in America that system has been unleashed that beast system and
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.320]  we've just passively learned to accept it we shouldn't we're gonna speak out
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:33.840]  more about it on the other side and against this evil concentration of
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:38.040]  power tyranny always takes over and tries to shut up the dissidents we're
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:42.360]  not gonna let it happen this time info wars calm let's fight back join us for
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:46.800]  more analysis on the other side and more of the censored episode that didn't

[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:21.680]  the feds who didn't want this kind of information to get out we heard about the

[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.320]  sometime early next year that they're shooting right now and I can tell you
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:32.000]  that never before on national mainstream TV have they addressed the new world
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:37.040]  order private fellow reserve the global warming hoax all these serious issues
[01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:41.840]  population reduction and they got record ratings on true TV showing the
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:45.480]  population is hungry for the truth and the system knows that so they want to
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:50.480]  give a tainted version of it because the people are demanding it the system
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:54.280]  wants to stay relevant so they're trying to cover some of it they've allowed
[01:34:54.280 --> 01:35:03.280]  Ventura to go very far but only so far because the system is scared the system
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:08.280]  knows the people are waking up and the controllers of this police state
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:13.520]  control grid do not want you to see this information and since this aired we
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:16.760]  have a governor's council over all rural affairs run by Homeland Security
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:20.640]  Department of Defense since this aired we have a super congress that creates
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:25.400]  all the major bills including quote secret farm mills it's in the
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:29.320]  Constitution that bills originate in the house now it's a super committee of
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:32.880]  the House and Senate and the president has the tie-breaking vote and if they
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:38.360]  don't vote for the bill they're given then it just goes back to what the
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:43.000]  super congress wanted Europe is under a new dictatorship they call it Bank of
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:49.120]  the World and admit it's on democratic this is all happening it turns out we
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:53.440]  were right TSA is now announcing checkpoints on the highways of America
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:58.360]  and they're setting them up it's actually happening now street lights and
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:03.320]  other systems with cameras and microphones it's all happening now and
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:09.440]  Jesse Ventura and his television show broke it all down imagine dozens of
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:14.840]  fusion centers dozens of many dictators you never heard of a secret
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:19.400]  government funded by elite power brokers in the top echelon of Washington
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:26.680]  what's the scheme here I got an idea when I got a call from Austin Texas it
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:34.280]  was Alex Jones my conspiracy insider he knew that June was in town and when he
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:39.280]  heard the term fusion center he went ballistic governor I need to talk to
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:43.560]  you right away that's just the tip of the iceberg these fusion centers aren't
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:47.760]  just to keep tabs on the public and spy on us they're really command and control
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:51.400]  centers for the concentration camps that are being expanded all over the
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:57.440]  nation concentration camps I knew this was gonna get bigger but I had to see
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:04.320]  this for myself I met Alex outside a federal prison in Texas at least it
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:09.480]  seemed to be a present this is also designated as a civil unrest center and
[01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:15.040]  there's 11,000 plus acres in this area controlled by Department of Defense so
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:20.040]  there's much more potential prison space than what we're seeing right here yes
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:23.960]  this is one of the major complexes in the United States for suppressing the
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:28.880]  major cities during unrest with a financial collapse or during a war or
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:32.840]  during a revolution in this country looks like they're waiting to put us all
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:39.800]  behind bars we know that they plan to use the cover story that these centers
[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:43.440]  were for illegal aliens or undocumented immigrants but that they would
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:47.360]  then build them all over the nation prisons that are for entire families
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:52.120]  similar to the Nazi concentration camps or similar to many in turn American
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:59.240]  Japanese citizens in World War two exactly that government plan to suspend
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:04.800]  the Constitution declare martial law and round up anyone deemed a national
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:11.360]  security threat it's documented it's called Rex 84 it was cooked up under
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:15.880]  the Reagan administration by Colonel Oliver Norrson nothing but the fruits
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:19.040]  or help you God I do
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:23.240]  June was in Las Vegas with the constitutional expert named Stuart
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:29.200]  Rhodes from honest aid to Barack Obama he says presidents have been taking away
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:35.960]  our rights whenever they want executive orders over the years give the
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:40.720]  president the claimed authority to do all kinds of extraordinary things like
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:45.520]  round up Americans and in turn them without due process
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:50.320]  so we go through some of these executive orders sure the first big one was
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:55.200]  Lincoln during the Civil War he ordered embargoes and blockades of southern
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:39:03.120]  ports on his own a suspended habeas corpus a lot of them realize that FDR by
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:07.120]  executive order ordered the detention of American citizens they were American
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:10.440]  citizens but they happen to be of Japanese descent there were the corral
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:15.000]  that over a hundred thousand were in turn for years no due process at all but
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.280]  the more recent one which has raised a few eyebrows is the one issue January
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:26.840]  11th 2010 which is called which establishes the Council of Governors the
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:32.480]  Council of Governors nine state governors and one from Puerto Rico in case of a
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:37.720]  national emergency they quarantine the country into ten sectors and take
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:43.640]  control from the rest of the governor's and state legislators if the president
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:48.520]  wanted to send in military or round up dissidents in a state his Council of
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:54.520]  cronies would rubber stamp anything that's why they got picked they call
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:40:00.880]  it a residential center but it looks a hell of a lot more like a prison to me
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:07.800]  double fences floodlights barbed wire to keep people from getting out and at the
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:14.800]  main entrance just like Nazi Germany
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:20.040]  Halliburton others have gotten contracts that they will not only hold
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:24.920]  immigrants or foreigners in these facilities but political dissidents
[01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:27.800]  and they're building these centers all over the country and they call them
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:32.480]  residential centers with fences because they're designed to hold whole
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:38.880]  families hell of a place to raise a family investigator Daniel Kuchen is on
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:43.200]  the road in California searching for other detention facilities said to be
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:48.800]  hidden in plain sight his guide is William Lewis an activist who's
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:55.800]  identified eight hundred prison camp locations William speaks via webcam he
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:41:01.560]  reveals that a bill in the US Congress HR 645 calls for the creation of these
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:10.200]  camps they'd be run by the Secretary of Homeland Security any kind of military
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:16.640]  base can be converted into a camp the first thing that you need is a secured
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:21.440]  perimeter a fence with barbed wire portion turned inward to keep people in
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:27.480]  instead of keep people out some type of a guard tower some type of an airfield
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:34.560]  nearby rail line or train tracks just like the Japanese internment camps of
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:41.080]  the 1940s so my question is who are they going to put into these camps I have a
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:46.880]  feeling that it's going to be people like you and me really talk to you lock
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:56.280]  in lock lock we can't even go in hello it took a while
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:42:03.960]  but finally someone came out the spokeswoman what is this place
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:11.720]  residential center residential center yes it looks like a prison I mean I've
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:16.560]  never seen a residential center that has two sets of fences go around with it
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:21.040]  looks identical to a prison to me well reason I'm here is just to see what I
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:26.800]  can do for you today and well you can answer my questions well the reason for
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:31.800]  that is to protect the privacy of the residents inside and why do they need
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:37.200]  protection well I tell you what I can what I can do for you sir I can't I'm
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:43.000]  more than happy to forward all your questions to our to our folks at ICE
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.640]  they'd be more than happy to talk and ice is your inspiration and customs
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:55.400]  enforcement I was getting tag team by spokespeople just so I have it on the
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:59.160]  record for a residential place I've never seen one with a lock front door and
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:03.360]  double fences it looks to me it looks very much like a present well we're
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:08.400]  charged with their safety as well so who's after them I'm sorry who would be
[01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:13.560]  after them that should be double fences and this type of security you got Al
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:20.240]  Capone in there I thought I'd seen enough but Alex Jones wanted me to visit
[01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:32.280]  one more location Madison Georgia what in the hell is this it's hundreds of
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:38.240]  thousands plastic coffin so each one of those is a separate coffin stacked on
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:44.000]  top there's probably what 20 to 25 per stack and how many stacks literally
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:49.280]  hundreds of them and you can fit four dead bodies per plastic office basically
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:56.120]  a giant body bag tens of thousands of coffins officially their plastic
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:44:03.680]  grave liners seven feet long three feet deep with lids the company that makes
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:08.920]  them says they're just being stored for people's pre-needs well who in the hell
[01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:16.120]  as a pre-need for this many coffins unless they're planning a massacre they
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:20.240]  have to get rid of people or dissidents or whatever they got certainly got the
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:27.280]  caskets for it don't they the place it makes these boxes used to be a
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:32.240]  research and development arm of Hercules incorporated Hercules is a major
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:39.240]  defense contractor with ties to hell the feds gave 385 million dollars to a
[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:45.760]  Halliburton subsidiary to build the detention centers it seems everything
[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:50.480]  that I'm investigating the trail seems to lead to Halliburton all the time
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:54.680]  exactly a governor the admitted Homeland Security contracts with those
[01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:59.160]  camp centers that's even in mainstream news it's Halliburton it always goes
[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:04.600]  back to Halliburton but it doesn't end there these detention centers and camps
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:10.000]  are run by FEMA the federal agency that's supposed to help us in crisis is
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:16.360]  ready to round us up FEMA already has the country divided into 10 regions and
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:23.920]  they match almost perfectly with the Council of Governors 10 sectors and so
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:28.200]  these are sitting here waiting for the implement of martial law possibly and
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:31.960]  remember this is right outside Atlanta Georgia where the Centers for Disease
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:35.800]  Control is based I'm gonna give you some of these secret government documents
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:39.160]  that we've gotten from where they admit that they've got stockpiled for the
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:48.280]  biological pandemic this is the perfect pretext to bring in martial law using
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:55.360]  the fear generated by a pandemic they start a pandemic as an excuse an
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:46:00.760]  excuse to put away anybody who gets in the way of their power the feds would
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:06.360]  trigger a nationwide outbreak of deadly disease the bodies would pile up the
[01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:12.000]  military would pile in and the concentration camp gates would open we
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:17.520]  have government documents where the CDC is preparing for mass pandemics hundreds
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:22.440]  of thousands or even millions dead there's this massive preparation going
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:29.200]  on the plagues and literal mega death mega death well that's one way to put it
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:34.440]  it makes you wonder about all the flues that spread like wildfire how quickly
[01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:39.280]  they kill all the outbreaks and vaccinations and how simple it would be
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:45.680]  for the elites to put the plan into action and we may have arrived just in
[01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:52.480]  time to expose the evidence in the hours after we left workers began hustling to
[01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:58.640]  get the coffins out of there it was time to meet the ones who are making all
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:03.640]  this possible now I've seen enough evidence I want to know why our
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:08.920]  congressman think we need prison camps for ordinary citizens they put it right
[01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:15.320]  in a congressional bill HR 645 I went to Washington to find some of the
[01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:19.600]  congressman who co-sponsored the bill first there was congressman and
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:25.160]  co-sponsored Jim Gerlach of Pennsylvania when I arrived at his office on Capitol
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:29.960]  Hill his chief of staff said the congressman would be glad to see me
[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:35.680]  until he found out what I wanted to talk about these femur camps then Gerlach
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:43.880]  ran away on two separate occasions
[01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:53.000]  he says he's all excited to talk to me all morning and then we go in there and
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:00.560]  he heads home right after he finishes a vote yeah right congressman Steve
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:07.280]  Cohen of Tennessee agreed to talk about the bill remember he's a co-sponsor I'm
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:11.920]  here to talk to you about these femur camps I'm very disturbed about them why
[01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:16.040]  would we be building these things all over the country for what purpose well
[01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:20.640]  we wouldn't because they don't exist it's just a figment of some people who
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:27.800]  are concerned about maybe Martians or other creatures coming to infiltrate
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:33.040]  our society thinking that there are such camps there are no such fit so why
[01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:37.760]  was it put into that bill it's in a big it's in a bill so it's put into the
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:41.640]  bill it doesn't exist there are no FEMA camps anywhere in America no there
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:46.400]  aren't what was the place I saw in Texas I don't know what it was called a
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:52.200]  residence it had two 20-foot high fences around it when I knocked on the
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:57.160]  door it was locked when the people came to the door no comment was the answer I
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:49:02.040]  got on any question and what disturbed me the most about this place was in the
[01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:07.160]  back it was like a daycare there's slides and swings for children and I said do
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:11.840]  you keep children inside this place no comment have you ever kept children in
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:16.520]  this place no comment I haven't been there so I have no idea maybe they're immature
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:20.880]  people so you're telling me there isn't one FEMA camp of these in the United
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:26.240]  States right now there are not why is it in that bill what is exactly in the
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:30.360]  bill it's talking about building FEMA camps doesn't it that particular bill
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:36.960]  that we're talking about I would have if they'd like to see the bill isn't this
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:44.280]  guy a co-sponsor of the bill what's the bill number
[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:49.200]  city FEMA camps and built within the United States how can a bill state that
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:52.920]  there'll be six FEMA camps built in the United States and then I'm being told
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:57.840]  there are none well I think you know I think I recall now something about this
[01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:02.760]  and I and if I'm correct I think those are locations for if there's a
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:06.200]  disaster like in Katrina I think that's what it is it's not any kind of a
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:12.520]  concentration camp or anything to round up citizens thinks that's what it is the
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:16.800]  bill that he co-sponsored says the use of the camps will be determined by the
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:22.160]  secretary of Homeland Security they can come and go as they please they won't be

[01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:20.800]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I again am Aaron Dyke sitting in and you
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:26.840]  have been just tuning in to large clips from the censored police state episode
[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:31.040]  of Jesse Ventura's conspiracy theory program it's a very good program but I
[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:35.960]  have to say if I have any criticism of it it's it's the unfortunate way that the
[01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:40.320]  repeated clips and stuff distract from the straightforward message and that's
[01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:43.520]  why I tried to boil down in these clips just straightforward what they're
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:48.080]  saying cutting out even the very dramatic and interesting recaps of stuff we
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:52.680]  heard previously but you see the whole system building towards tyranny they
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:57.640]  have set up the separatists for a reason and it's just incredible the way this
[01:54:57.640 --> 01:55:02.720]  episode builds to the congressman admitting that yes there are these
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:08.000]  detention centers that were set up in the bill authorized in HR 645 but those
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:11.960]  are for emergency there's no FEMA camps to intern Americans that's something
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:15.880]  people on the internet have imagined that's a little green Martian thing I
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:20.040]  mean what a bunch of crock and he got caught you know right there on camera
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:24.560]  Jesse Ventura was in the zone and really nailed him on that point and it's a
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:28.520]  very important point because they really want to keep the public out of
[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:32.360]  awareness of this and if they have any awareness they want to always throw to
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:35.960]  pretext to other reasons for the reasons why they're being governed by the
[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:40.200]  rulers of course they're going to give the general population excuses for why
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:43.760]  they have these centers built up but we know they have prepared for civil unrest
[01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:48.160]  they prepared for this economic crisis that they otherwise set in motion and
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:52.560]  they have prepared for internal revolutions potential riots that's why
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:56.720]  they put provocateurs in at these mass demonstrations and that's why they try
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:56:00.760]  to steer it as much as they can left and right but they know even that only goes
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:05.640]  so far in the political paradigm there's always power to share and this
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:08.960]  system in the United States was set up under the Constitution so we have
[01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:13.560]  individual rights and liberties and also so that the powers diffuse through the
[01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:17.640]  various bodies the executive branch the judicial and the two houses of
[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:22.080]  Congress the state and local governments and they have tried to circumvent or
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:26.520]  supersede all of that with these executively ordered councils the
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:30.480]  Council of Governors and the rest of it that Ventura and Alex break down so
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:33.720]  well and that's why I want to queue up now Ventura's conclusion to this episode
[01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:39.880]  and then Alex's comments. They said it couldn't happen here but it already is
[01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:44.520]  happening and we've already allowed our elected officials to break all kinds of
[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:51.560]  laws designed to protect you and me you thought we had 50 states nope we've
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:57.600]  learned there's 10 sectors ruled by 10 people you didn't vote for you support
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:01.920]  your local police that's nothing not when they've got the military ready to
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:07.200]  take over you signed a petition outside the supermarket who knows what list
[01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:12.280]  you're on now and what about all these detention centers why do you think the
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:18.000]  standard answer is no comment and here's what's worse they're doing it all in
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:22.760]  the name of national security talk about the fear factor I've said it before
[01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:28.480]  and I'll say it now I'd rather face the dangers than lose my freedom I'm Jesse
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:34.800]  Ventura and this is conspiracy theory so that's it in a nutshell from the
[01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:39.400]  groundbreaking and entirely censored police state episode of conspiracy
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:45.560]  theory it's on for a third season somehow it was finagled Jesse Ventura just
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:50.040]  as an individual vowed not to travel on the airlines he found a way to do it but
[01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:53.880]  traveling by vehicle and having other people come to him and we're glad that's
[01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:58.240]  continuing but keep in mind they actually censored this episode kept it from
[01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:03.840]  rebroadcast deleted it from DVR boxes and rerun listings and the rest of it
[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:09.880]  let's cue Alex's comments you thoughts you had 50 governors think again you've
[01:58:09.880 --> 01:58:17.600]  got 10 regions the police state isn't coming it's already here it's Ventura
[01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:22.920]  summation that scared the system at the end I'm gonna throw it to Aaron Dykes

[02:00:28.760 --> 02:00:36.720]  regions the police state isn't coming it's already here it's Ventura summation
[02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:41.640]  that scared the system at the end I'm gonna throw it to Aaron Dykes who's
[02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:47.560]  sitting in for me I'll be back live here on the radio tomorrow Friday on air but
[02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:52.320]  I hope that you get this presentation in my intro and the information that Aaron's
[02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:57.000]  about to break down out to everybody you know because since this aired a year
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:02.360]  ago last November so much of this unfortunately has now come true the
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:07.080]  controlled bioweapons release that we know the globalist are preparing for can
[02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:12.240]  only be stopped if we are aware of this problem reaction solution system and
[02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:17.160]  expose it there's nothing better for taking over society than a staged
[02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:21.080]  bioweapon attack but the controllers have to make sure that all of their
[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:24.600]  minions are going to follow orders and take over the states and local
[02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:28.280]  governments during the crisis the only reason they haven't launched it yet is
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:34.400]  because Ventura myself and others are exposing it and so there you have it
[02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:37.960]  Alex's comments and we're waiting to see if he's going to be joining us in the
[02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:43.120]  broadcast either way he is broadcasting live tomorrow though remotely and this
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:47.120]  has been great with Alex being able to be on the road with his family and still
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:51.800]  bringing you fresh news on a daily basis we've also got the Info Wars nightly
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:55.760]  news program coming up and that's going to be an important one as well we've got
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:02:00.400]  Rob do going to bring you information tonight and he's covering everything
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:05.440]  from how TSA knew that body scanners could cause cancer but they went ahead
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:10.840]  with it anyway try to cover up and obscure various studies and now they're
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:14.000]  being banned in the EU as well that's a good sign but we know there's other
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:18.640]  tyranny they're moving forward with we've also got coverage of the MF global
[02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:22.600]  money scandal you've heard Gerald Salente on this program about how he was
[02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:26.640]  robbed of more than six figures and we know it was hundreds and hundreds of
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:31.320]  millions of dollars that went missing and now reports say that money may have
[02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:36.040]  went directly to JP Morgan who had kind of a trustee status with the MF global
[02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:40.600]  bank and Rob do is going to break down just a few of the scandals that JP
[02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:45.080]  Morgan executives have been in trouble for recently but as Gerald Salente
[02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:48.600]  pointed out when do you ever see the big wigs going down for this you see a
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:53.440]  Bernie Madoff or somebody who's burned he's certainly an important schemer part
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:57.800]  of a larger Ponzi scheme but he's just one of a whole grouping of them
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:02.120]  meanwhile you have all this stuff happening with the Super Congress the
[02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:06.680]  committee that may pass a resolution to give itself more time that says it's
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:11.240]  split over how to break up the debt the one side doesn't want to cut one part
[02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:14.120]  of the budget the other side doesn't want to cut other parts of the budget
[02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:18.400]  they want to keep the military budget intact and well we're going to see what's
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:23.600]  happened but any way you slice it it is a evil concentration of power you never
[02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:27.920]  want that much power in that few hands and that's what all this police stuff
[02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:33.120]  state is about it's about giving the federal mechanisms the power to
[02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:38.880]  supersede local and state governments to kind of coerce them and coax them and
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:43.160]  convince them that there's so much danger amongst the population so many
[02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:47.080]  things they don't know that's going to happen that they logically should hand
[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:52.280]  over the power and authority to fight terrorism unrest and spy on political
[02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:58.000]  dissidents to Homeland Security and their sub agencies even at these protests
[02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:01.240]  which overall protesting is a very healthy thing it's part of the
[02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:06.560]  democratic process the problem is we have been more and more taken over by
[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:12.040]  this authoritarian oligarchy and interlocking cartel system you know who
[02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:16.120]  they are they're these bankers we always talk about the Bilderberg type entities
[02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:22.040]  much of the top corporations in this country and surprisingly they're all
[02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:26.200]  working together even on science and research agendas and the rest of it and
[02:04:26.200 --> 02:04:31.520]  that power is expressed in these bought-out heavily lobbied super
[02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:34.960]  congressmen and we're going to get more into that we also have infowars writer
[02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:39.240]  Patrick Henningson bringing us updates on Occupy Wall Street and who knows
[02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:44.160]  Alex may also surface stay tuned for that we'll take your calls to the Alex
[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:47.680]  Jones show we're covering groundbreaking information let us know what
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:51.720]  you think info wars comm stay tuned
[02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:08.200]  when you're out on the road the last place you want to be is on the road but

[02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:45.960]  news as you know a lot of bad things going on in the world but we still have
[02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:50.880]  each other and really taking it back to the family and local level is a big
[02:08:50.880 --> 02:08:55.400]  part of the solution as I'm sure you've come to terms with and we're going to
[02:08:55.400 --> 02:08:59.600]  cover a lot of news here I also want to take your calls later in this segment

[02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:11.120]  Henningson and that call in number is 1-800-259-9231 it's open phones but at
[02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:15.000]  the same time we've been covering all this geoengineering and chemtrails
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:19.600]  research we've been covering the censored police state episode and all the
[02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:23.960]  things that have been happening in the police state the reality that these
[02:09:23.960 --> 02:09:28.880]  FEMA camps exist that they've been prepared to deal with whatever sector of
[02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:35.640]  the American population they can't control they've expanded TSA procedures
[02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:39.480]  to groping and pat downs and dangerous body scanners meanwhile they've
[02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:44.000]  expanded to highway checkpoints the Viper teams the train and bus station
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:48.600]  random checks and all the rest of it there's so much going on while so much
[02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:54.440]  power has been taken at the executive and congressional levels all these
[02:09:54.440 --> 02:09:58.320]  executive orders are a big part of the problem as well and so are all these
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:01.680]  puppet candidates that were cycled through again and again each election
[02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:05.000]  cycle as though they're different people as though they represent different
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:10.400]  ideas they don't let's get over the hoax that our vote matters and that we have
[02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:14.440]  this democratic process it's been hijacked people and so I want to hear
[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:20.520]  from you at 1-800-259-9231 now in a historical context you have people out
[02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:25.000]  of Europe in the Renaissance and the Enlightenment and the age of reasons and
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:29.280]  the related movements going on over there one of those important authors was
[02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:35.120]  Nikolai Machiavelli and he's known for his Machiavellian cutthroat schemes the
[02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:41.800]  kind of real politics analysis of things and certainly he was a dangerous man but
[02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:46.480]  he was also challenging authority at the time the various families that ran
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:50.920]  things there and so forth but he had a major contribution to Thomas Jefferson
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:55.320]  and the other founders who recognized the extreme need for these checks and
[02:10:55.320 --> 02:11:00.200]  balances that you don't want a federal government to have total power because it
[02:11:00.200 --> 02:11:04.920]  will definitely become a tyranny man is a flawed creature whatever you want to
[02:11:04.920 --> 02:11:12.000]  consider him and you cannot trust any one man or any one group of men to carry
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:18.200]  out and execute the powers that exist on this earth it's gonna go bad and with
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:22.160]  that in mind people like Machiavelli realized there had to be a balance he
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:27.560]  realized there was kind of a natural existence of the upper elite class what
[02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:31.520]  later became the Senate the elitist families the people of money the
[02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:35.960]  nobility the wealthy and semi-wealthy that they were their own power node
[02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:41.080]  semi-naturally you've also got the actual power of the state which itself
[02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:46.280]  tends to become tyrannical and then you have the plebiscites the lower classes
[02:11:46.280 --> 02:11:50.320]  and this middle-class thing in the United States that's new as is the
[02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:54.880]  Constitution and yet it's eroding away just as quickly as the Constitution and
[02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:59.120]  in particular the Bill of Rights protections point being you got Machiavelli
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:04.480]  really arguing for this counterbalance of powers trying to diffuse that power
[02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:08.840]  just as people like Thomas Jefferson wanted to bind down that power with the
[02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:12.880]  Constitution now if it sounds like I'm repeating myself I'm just trying to get
[02:12:12.880 --> 02:12:18.120]  the point across that things like the Super Congress are a tyranny outright
[02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:22.440]  things like the Council of Governors and things like the rural councils that
[02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:27.600]  have Department of Defense and Homeland Security components overseeing local
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:31.720]  jurisdictions is a tyranny you never want to give those people that much power
[02:12:31.720 --> 02:12:36.040]  even if they're made up pretexts were true even if there was terrorism going
[02:12:36.040 --> 02:12:41.160]  on everywhere and little hidden people behind every seemingly normal group what
[02:12:41.160 --> 02:12:43.960]  they really want to do is control the population and they're going to give us
[02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:49.440]  any reason they need for it and just part of that super committee thing is
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:54.200]  Mike Adams article today about the illegal super committee now pushing a
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:59.480]  secret farm bill that will cost billions so bottom line this highly
[02:12:59.480 --> 02:13:03.680]  concentrated power of 12 members of Congress with the president with the
[02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:09.720]  13th and veto vote really is shaping laws and pushing through things for the
[02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:12.680]  typical agendas that they represent because they're all bought out by
[02:13:12.680 --> 02:13:19.200]  lobbyist and that includes the mega monopoly farms the subsidies for all
[02:13:19.200 --> 02:13:23.640]  the wrong products that are harming us and Mike Adams article is up there
[02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:28.200]  you've also got just to remind you people like Mario Monti an absolute
[02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:32.920]  Bilderberg steering member Bilderberg group insider head of the European
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:38.760]  branch of the trilateral Commission and other such notoriety totally working
[02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:42.400]  with the bankers he is a banker stooge candidate he's now in charge of Italy
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:47.040]  Greece is going the same way from one banker stooge to another it's a banker
[02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:53.080]  takeover on the the predicated pretext of this European banking crisis and
[02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:57.240]  that's really what we're seeing you've also got stuff like Congress less
[02:13:57.240 --> 02:14:03.160]  popular than communism BP during the oil spill Nixon during Watergate or King
[02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:07.000]  George III during the American Revolution and it goes on to highlight
[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:13.120]  how Congress has in October 2011 approval rating of about 9% even King
[02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:18.200]  George during the American Revolution had about 15 to 20% support among the
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:22.080]  loyalist so if that doesn't say something about the revolutionary state of
[02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:26.320]  affairs we're in I don't know what is also Curt Nemo's article Herman Cain
[02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:30.920]  courts war criminal globalist Henry Kissinger and Herman Cain's been
[02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:34.680]  photographed meeting with Kissinger multiple times and even asked him to be
[02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:39.080]  his secretary of state if he gets the nomination in the presidency Kissinger
[02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:42.840]  apparently turned it down but how much does that say about the Federal Reserve
[02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:48.040]  stooge working hand-in-hand with the Rockefeller's top lieutenant with the
[02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:52.400]  total Bilderberg insider total establishment agenda for the takeover of
[02:14:52.400 --> 02:14:56.480]  this country Henry Kissinger and I don't know if you remember is in either the
[02:14:56.480 --> 02:15:00.800]  first or second GOP debates Herman Cain was asked about foreign policy would he
[02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:04.840]  bring home the troops would he in the wars in Iraq Afghanistan would he curb
[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:10.240]  the other conflicts going on and now 10 or more countries I believe it adds up
[02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:15.440]  to Herman Cain said I don't know what I would do I would defer to my advisors
[02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:20.040]  and who are his advisors the same council and foreign relations goons who've
[02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:22.960]  helped take over this country what else do you expect from a Federal Reserve
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:27.200]  stooge of course all these candidates are bad it's up for Ron Paul who's getting
[02:15:27.200 --> 02:15:31.280]  the snub as you know but it's just another thing to watch and so telling
[02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:36.320]  when Rockefeller and Kissinger show up in the cabinets and advisorships of
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:41.000]  these candidates just disgusting and all the stuff going on with MF global
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:46.600]  money I want to hear your take do we have any callers now I don't know if the
[02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:52.480]  guys in the booth are ready with any callers but that number is 1-800-259-9231
[02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:59.760]  if anyone wants to weigh in now also on the global front on the war front on the
[02:15:59.760 --> 02:16:06.080]  geopolitical front you have a US plot to wage Syria war revealed that is out of
[02:16:06.080 --> 02:16:11.400]  press TV so keep in mind that's from the sphere but still things are going on
[02:16:11.400 --> 02:16:17.480]  there okay we do have a caller chip in New Mexico yeah and I just also wanted
[02:16:17.480 --> 02:16:22.080]  to point out that a top Russian general says there's a growing risk of nuclear
[02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:28.960]  war and you also have other foreign policy news as well how to find that in
[02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:36.000]  the stack chip in New Mexico what's on your mind yes I'm currently trying to
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:41.880]  help the Reese family in New Mexico they own a gun store over in Jimmy New
[02:16:41.880 --> 02:16:48.200]  Mexico they came in and raided them arrest the wife him as wife and as two
[02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:55.520]  kids and they're being held behind bars without bail I am friends with a family
[02:16:55.520 --> 02:16:59.360]  his mother I talked to her today and things are going fairly well but it's
[02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:04.000]  it's a slow process or even resist and letting them have a have private
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:08.760]  attorneys they're trying to fight that off the district the prosecuting attorney
[02:17:08.760 --> 02:17:14.080]  is they want to be used state attorneys and I just want to let people know that
[02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:18.600]  the Constitution's gone if we if we lose the second amendment that's it's gone
[02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:23.560]  it's history and we have to do something if you would like to interview this
[02:17:23.560 --> 02:17:30.080]  family I also couldn't give you the phone number for this family the mother
[02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:34.120]  and she will set you up with the attorney right ship why don't you give the
[02:17:34.120 --> 02:17:37.400]  number to the people behind the scenes but tell us something specifically about
[02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:41.880]  what's going on I know generally these family courts are really charged with
[02:17:41.880 --> 02:17:45.680]  breaking up the family and ruining families but what what exactly happened
[02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:51.520]  in this case well they went to the gun store and just literally raided it they
[02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:56.880]  confiscated all their assets they took all the guns out they confiscated his
[02:17:56.880 --> 02:18:04.240]  bank account and his mother is a she when she was younger she was a civil
[02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:10.560]  attorney and so consequently she knew a little bit about the law which did help
[02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:17.520]  but she wasn't a criminal since then they just refused to let any amount on bail
[02:18:17.520 --> 02:18:22.000]  they said they're a flight risk which they're not these are good people if I
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:25.200]  was gonna have somebody stop along the highway and help me I'd want these
[02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:32.400]  people to be there for me yeah they're just great people and they really they
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:36.440]  really need to get the word out about what's happening here this has happened
[02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:41.920]  in other places recently also and what I'm trying to do is get people behind
[02:18:41.920 --> 02:18:47.600]  this and and so that it will move in the right direction these people need to be
[02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:52.280]  free they're not they're no danger to society in any way they're good people
[02:18:52.280 --> 02:18:57.840]  and they're applied by the law well ship we know they are definitely targeting
[02:18:57.840 --> 02:19:01.000]  the second amendment I'm gonna put you in contact with the producers we'll try to
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:06.040]  find out more if we can let's find out what Russell in Colorado is bringing
[02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:12.520]  happy how you doing today I'm just calling up to say that I intend to go
[02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:17.360]  down after work tomorrow and protest down at Denver International Airport I
[02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:20.840]  think airports are a great place for a protest what they did to just if it
[02:19:20.840 --> 02:19:25.480]  sure wasn't right people need to get wise that unlawful search and seizure is
[02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:31.080]  unconstitutional I agree I think that's a great idea to protest to airports
[02:19:31.080 --> 02:19:35.160]  they're just gonna grab more and more power it's disgusting anything else you
[02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:38.280]  want to add Russell or should we bring someone up on the other side

[02:20:08.840 --> 02:20:12.440]  in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or

[02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:32.520]  covered all manner of hidden information today from the secret geo
[02:24:32.520 --> 02:24:37.540]  engineering program which Alex and I helped to expose recently on the info
[02:24:37.540 --> 02:24:42.280]  wars nightly news to Jesse Ventura's censored police state episode and all
[02:24:42.280 --> 02:24:46.000]  the things he's been trying to do with his TSA lawsuit he's really been a
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:50.200]  fighter I know all you listeners out there are fighters too so tell us how
[02:24:50.200 --> 02:24:54.640]  you see the fight going what do you think will happen particularly as people
[02:24:54.640 --> 02:24:59.000]  do begin to lash out but not always in the most sophisticated ways we've seen
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:04.080]  mass protest but how do we focus people's attention on the true parasite
[02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:08.280]  class in a way that understands what they really are that it's a crony
[02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:11.760]  capitalism of government plus Wall Street it's not just Wall Street it's not
[02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:17.040]  just government it's the powers we've let them take from us so with that in
[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:23.120]  mind let's hit another caller Matt in Nebraska hit us and what's going on well
[02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:29.120]  doing the broadcast now so what's on your mind hey the FEMA camps they just got
[02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:36.600]  one opened in the council plus Iowa it's called a disaster recovery center well
[02:25:36.600 --> 02:25:41.560]  we know they can convert just about any kind of military or open grounds into a
[02:25:41.560 --> 02:25:44.880]  FEMA camp and there's more than 800 locations I think that have been
[02:25:44.880 --> 02:25:50.240]  identified yeah but they just opened this one two weeks ago after the flood of
[02:25:50.240 --> 02:25:54.920]  Missouri but I don't know why it took so long for them to do it but they're I'm
[02:25:54.920 --> 02:25:57.520]  just saying that they're out there people don't want to realize that they're
[02:25:57.520 --> 02:26:01.680]  out there so and then the gunshot detectors on the hog got one up and the
[02:26:01.680 --> 02:26:05.920]  gunshot detectors don't work they just had a shooting in North Omaha and they
[02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:09.400]  did close down the school they didn't lock down the school like they usually do
[02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:13.760]  so I mean that the gunshot detectors are work with and all they're doing is buying
[02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:18.040]  on you yeah and in places like Denver they do these terror drills where they
[02:26:18.040 --> 02:26:22.000]  freak out these children and plan for a massive shooter spree and then they put
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:25.960]  out these Homeland Security funded videos where they say don't even trust your
[02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:30.240]  neighbor don't even trust your best friend so you're saying after the floods
[02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:34.560]  are they selling this FEMA camp on the pretext of of having a place to take
[02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:39.040]  people in natural disaster type emergencies there instead of camping
[02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:42.440]  out in state parks like most of them have been doing they've been staying in
[02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:45.640]  their mobile homes and now they want them to come down to the FEMA disaster
[02:26:45.640 --> 02:26:50.680]  recovery center it's incredible and you saw the congressman in the venture
[02:26:50.680 --> 02:26:54.720]  episode try to say that's what these established FEMA camp centers are for
[02:26:54.720 --> 02:26:59.520]  but we also know it's for economic unrest internal revolutions anything they
[02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:03.760]  consider to be out of control populations and some of these state parks
[02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:08.280]  down here or open all year round and I mean as long as they're paying for it
[02:27:08.280 --> 02:27:11.360]  but now the state parks are trying to kick them out and trying to get them
[02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:14.280]  down to the disaster recovery center which I don't think is right either so
[02:27:14.280 --> 02:27:18.840]  you guys should look into that one too okay tell me one more time where the
[02:27:18.840 --> 02:27:26.640]  location is it's in council love to Iowa if you go to KETV.com I know they got
[02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:33.600]  the story link up there it's around the lake open the lake area so there's
[02:27:33.600 --> 02:27:37.360]  water and then there's the right next to the airport to the train tracks so all
[02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:41.280]  right we'll try to check it out thank you Matt let's go now to Noel
[02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:51.120]  in Illinois welcome Aaron what's going on quickly it's funny I was on a friend's
[02:27:51.120 --> 02:27:57.960]  house last night watching sci-fi and they showed a preview of an upcoming
[02:27:57.960 --> 02:28:05.440]  sci-fi film called storm war on November 26 talking about weather
[02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:11.080]  modification a math scientist goes loose and conducts weather modification and
[02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:17.200]  massive storms all over the country so that's another indication that the you
[02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:20.120]  know showing the public are kind of admitting that this is what they're
[02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:25.640]  kind of doing to us and I've been watching a weather radar for the last
[02:28:25.640 --> 02:28:29.520]  couple of weeks or even months for that matter that if there's a program called
[02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:34.200]  in telecast which is run by the weather channel and if you look at in telecast
[02:28:34.200 --> 02:28:40.360]  you know late into the evening you'll see high-frequency beams being shot up
[02:28:40.360 --> 02:28:45.000]  into the atmosphere some user terminology harp rings on YouTube there's a
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:53.000]  YouTube user named Dutch said to cover this a lot and you see maybe you know
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:59.640]  you'll see bullseye rings into the atmosphere on the radar manipulating
[02:28:59.640 --> 02:29:05.840]  like a precipitation but a day two days maybe even three days later 24 to 72
[02:29:05.840 --> 02:29:12.040]  hours is the usual time frame you'll see storms hit that exact location of where
[02:29:12.040 --> 02:29:15.640]  you saw the frequency that you know I'm going with there yeah I do see where
[02:29:15.640 --> 02:29:18.960]  you're going and I know that talking technology is real I know they're using
[02:29:18.960 --> 02:29:23.120]  it in whatever capacity what I find hard is to nail down the exact when they
[02:29:23.120 --> 02:29:27.800]  used it yes this event may have been caused by that type of technology or
[02:29:27.800 --> 02:29:31.920]  no maybe we need to rule that out that's somewhere we need to do more research on
[02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:34.760]  try to get it together but we know they're out of control they've got to be
[02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:38.480]  criminally insane what they're doing to our earth atmosphere and the rest of it
[02:29:38.480 --> 02:29:42.200]  stay tuned infowars.com Patrick Henningson coming up and more of your

[02:33:23.600 --> 02:33:29.160]  when the levee breaks that's a big part of all these plans the globalists have
[02:33:29.160 --> 02:33:35.840]  made they have well-made laid plans and they plan to carry them out exactly how
[02:33:35.840 --> 02:33:40.800]  that will go we will see part of that has been manifest in the Tea Party and
[02:33:40.800 --> 02:33:47.040]  the counter occupy Wall Street movements which are largely steam valves for a
[02:33:47.040 --> 02:33:52.160]  mass awakening for a mass unrest energy they know is coming largely because of
[02:33:52.160 --> 02:33:56.880]  the economic breakdown and the unhappiness with Washington in general
[02:33:56.880 --> 02:34:02.680]  politics in general worldwide and all the lies and corruption people know about
[02:34:02.680 --> 02:34:07.160]  but don't know quite which way to steer into so they have left and right
[02:34:07.160 --> 02:34:13.200]  alternative steam valves in place to try to suck that energy and ultimately if
[02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:18.080]  possible steer it back into the very useful left-right paradigm which they
[02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:23.200]  operate under the Hegelian dialectic now where that does not succeed that's why
[02:34:23.200 --> 02:34:28.880]  they have other plans such as being able to round us up and preparations for
[02:34:28.880 --> 02:34:34.360]  riot control and the rest of it other excuses to keep people in check all the
[02:34:34.360 --> 02:34:38.480]  surveillance technology now they have things like these smart street lamps
[02:34:38.480 --> 02:34:43.360]  which are going to coordinate with federally issued emergency messages as
[02:34:43.360 --> 02:34:48.280]  well as just ordinary surveillance at random all this stuff is going on and for
[02:34:48.280 --> 02:34:53.200]  commentary on it we are joined by Patrick Henningson he's an info wars.com
[02:34:53.200 --> 02:34:59.720]  writer he's also the managing editor of 21st century wire.com and he's written
[02:34:59.720 --> 02:35:04.640]  for all kinds of publications including his most recent article in the London
[02:35:04.640 --> 02:35:11.200]  Guardian regarding Occupy and how the movement ends up doing the bidding of
[02:35:11.200 --> 02:35:16.480]  the global elite Patrick are you there yeah good to be with you Aaron yeah good
[02:35:16.480 --> 02:35:19.880]  to have you back Patrick thanks for joining us so obviously there's a lot
[02:35:19.880 --> 02:35:23.680]  going on with the Occupy Wall Street movement they've been kicked out of
[02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:28.280]  numerous locations they've recircled the wagons and they're back at force we
[02:35:28.280 --> 02:35:31.600]  hope it's not headed towards a conflict and we hope they're not going to play
[02:35:31.600 --> 02:35:35.920]  into the globalist designs I know you've been down there in London near that
[02:35:35.920 --> 02:35:40.840]  protest where police are also planning to evacuate people tell us what is the
[02:35:40.840 --> 02:35:46.440]  latest yeah I'm down here right now I'm at the St. Paul's Cathedral site which
[02:35:46.440 --> 02:35:51.920]  was originally occupied London Stock Exchange it's now occupied the City of
[02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:57.040]  London I'm down here on the site the police served the legal notice at 6 p.m.
[02:35:57.040 --> 02:36:01.200]  gave them till 6 p.m. and then they're going to start legal proceedings so
[02:36:01.200 --> 02:36:06.520]  there's not not going to be any batons and the City of London police aren't
[02:36:06.520 --> 02:36:11.120]  going to come out in their S&M black leather riot gear to turf everybody off
[02:36:11.120 --> 02:36:17.160]  like they did in in New York two days ago so that's good news for them so it's
[02:36:17.160 --> 02:36:20.680]  going to be a protracted legal battle with the Corporation of London which is
[02:36:20.680 --> 02:36:24.760]  not not London is in Mayor Boris Johnson this is the Corporation the
[02:36:24.760 --> 02:36:29.800]  City of London which dates back to 1067 that's who they're in a legal battle
[02:36:29.800 --> 02:36:35.080]  against and I think it'll be protracted out for about another month and a half
[02:36:35.080 --> 02:36:40.200]  actually the occupied crew here are quite quite heady they've got a excellent
[02:36:40.200 --> 02:36:44.840]  legal team on board so they're well prepared for this in advance they're
[02:36:44.840 --> 02:36:48.520]  quite they're quite knowledgeable about things some of the organizers have told
[02:36:48.520 --> 02:36:53.720]  me that they go to infowars.com for their news which I found quite interesting
[02:36:53.720 --> 02:36:58.000]  and was really encouraging so that's how they got in touch with me because of
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:03.960]  infowars.com so again hats off to you guys for you know putting the word out
[02:37:03.960 --> 02:37:08.200]  for the last few years it's definitely penetrating the psyche and we are
[02:37:08.200 --> 02:37:12.920]  winning an information war. Absolutely and of course it's always been a
[02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:16.560]  diverse group and we know many people are aware of issues like the Federal
[02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:20.360]  Reserve obviously if they're targeting the City of London they're on to the
[02:37:20.360 --> 02:37:25.600]  right enemy I mean is this become the parasite class versus the plebiscite
[02:37:25.600 --> 02:37:30.480]  class or which direction do you think this is heading? It's hard to say you
[02:37:30.480 --> 02:37:34.320]  know the biggest problem that these movements have and certainly I can say
[02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:39.280]  this for Occupy Wall Street and they're they're facing the same issues here in
[02:37:39.280 --> 02:37:43.920]  London is they're having trouble focusing okay and a lot of times you know
[02:37:43.920 --> 02:37:49.520]  they're the climate crew they're what I what I call the climate crazies they've
[02:37:49.520 --> 02:37:55.440]  entered the fray quite early and mapped out their pitch and so forth wanting to
[02:37:55.440 --> 02:38:01.080]  eat at this table but putting the climate crazies aside the focus is a big
[02:38:01.080 --> 02:38:06.240]  issue and I did I did highlight to some of the people down here I've spoken to
[02:38:06.240 --> 02:38:10.320]  quite a few people today and had some really good conversations that looked
[02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:15.120]  you know in America you had the bank transfer day on November 8th this is a
[02:38:15.120 --> 02:38:19.080]  woman I believe she's in Los Angeles she started a Facebook page a few months
[02:38:19.080 --> 02:38:24.480]  ago she said November 8th is bank transfer day and on November 8th millions
[02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:28.280]  of dollars hundreds of millions of dollars from what I can gather would
[02:38:28.280 --> 02:38:33.560]  transfer it out of major establishment mega banks global casino racetrack
[02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:40.400]  institutions and into local credit unions okay so in that one focused issue I
[02:38:40.400 --> 02:38:45.120]  think there's one girl who started off with a Facebook page managed to make a
[02:38:45.120 --> 02:38:50.640]  bigger material impact on the scene then the whole of the Occupy Wall Street
[02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:54.800]  might have done or might do by the time it's all said and done and there's a
[02:38:54.800 --> 02:38:58.840]  couple of the other issue is they're debating whether to have a global Occupy
[02:38:58.840 --> 02:39:03.480]  movement and some of the people asked me what I thought about that and I said I
[02:39:03.480 --> 02:39:08.120]  personally am against anything that's got global on the front of it because when
[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:13.400]  you start a global organization when you make a global organization offices in
[02:39:13.400 --> 02:39:18.160]  New York or London or whatever you're begging to interface with another
[02:39:18.160 --> 02:39:22.400]  global organization which will be a global government and I believe that the
[02:39:22.400 --> 02:39:26.240]  whole to go global with the Occupy movement I believe it's a little bit of
[02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:30.280]  a trap and it's really it's the elite it's the establishment and whatever you
[02:39:30.280 --> 02:39:36.400]  want to call it they're luring you into the global paradigm okay now if you look
[02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:40.880]  at global government you look at the UN you look at global corporations you look
[02:39:40.880 --> 02:39:44.640]  at global anything they don't do very well serving the interests of their
[02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:49.920]  individual constituents global corporations surely don't the UN has two
[02:39:49.920 --> 02:39:54.840]  sets of rules one for the US Britain Israel and one for the rest of them and
[02:39:54.840 --> 02:39:59.960]  we saw that in Libya so if anyone wants any indication as to how just and how
[02:39:59.960 --> 02:40:04.000]  fair a global government will be take a look at what happened in Libya look at
[02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:09.480]  what the UN did they've had a 1973 completely ridiculous resolution of a
[02:40:09.480 --> 02:40:15.040]  no-fly zone and quickly the powers that be being the UK Britain France and
[02:40:15.040 --> 02:40:20.040]  Israel and these sort of countries spun that into a bombing campaign and they
[02:40:20.040 --> 02:40:23.920]  turn the whole country to dust basically and now they're carving it up
[02:40:23.920 --> 02:40:28.040]  privatizing it selling all the assets off the cheap Greece has got the same
[02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:31.880]  issue with the European Union European Union's like a baby version of what a
[02:40:31.880 --> 02:40:36.320]  global government might look like to get everybody on one currency a European
[02:40:36.320 --> 02:40:41.640]  a global currency in the future and everybody is basically stuck in this
[02:40:41.640 --> 02:40:46.960]  paradigm and it's ruled by technocrats so if you have anyone is a fan of
[02:40:46.960 --> 02:40:50.440]  anything global have a look at what's going on in Europe right now and they'll
[02:40:50.440 --> 02:40:55.440]  have a very clear indication as to what they can expect from a global
[02:40:55.440 --> 02:41:00.520]  organization well of all the things you said I mean it's obviously the global
[02:41:00.520 --> 02:41:04.440]  trap is the biggest thing with this whole movement you've got this larger
[02:41:04.440 --> 02:41:08.920]  economic crisis going on and we could point to where the globalist fan those
[02:41:08.920 --> 02:41:13.680]  flames prepared themselves pop the housing bubble when the timing was right
[02:41:13.680 --> 02:41:18.720]  and really rode the wave of all their decades of financial abuse looting
[02:41:18.720 --> 02:41:24.120]  fraudulent transactions and the rest of it then from the problem reaction
[02:41:24.120 --> 02:41:27.680]  solution model you've got the reaction through the Occupy Wall Street and the
[02:41:27.680 --> 02:41:31.000]  related groups and there are the tentacles too of all these global
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:35.400]  organizations who are not only part of the problem but who are poised to offer
[02:41:35.400 --> 02:41:39.840]  these global solutions including new banks of the world new currency
[02:41:39.840 --> 02:41:45.760]  situations and the rest of it Patrick yeah the global token tax or as it's
[02:41:45.760 --> 02:41:50.880]  popularly called right now the Robin Hood tax there's a big split right now in
[02:41:50.880 --> 02:41:55.120]  the Occupy London the debate between all this sort of people at the roundtable
[02:41:55.120 --> 02:42:00.840]  there about this Robin Hood tax and I can really say I can put my hand you
[02:42:00.840 --> 02:42:06.600]  know my right hand on the Bible and say I truly believe and I in fact I know that
[02:42:06.600 --> 02:42:12.800]  any global Tobin tax or any any Robin Hood tax is basically going to turn into
[02:42:12.800 --> 02:42:17.400]  a slush fund which is going to be used or the bankers will tell you we need this
[02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:23.120]  to recapitalize banks who are in trouble so the Robin Hood tax will turn into a
[02:42:23.120 --> 02:42:27.920]  bailout sort of bailout funds and also there'll be a lot of money that will be
[02:42:27.920 --> 02:42:32.720]  needed to run a bureaucracy to administrate a Robin Hood or a Tobin tax
[02:42:32.720 --> 02:42:38.200]  because you think that hundreds of thousands of trades are being done per
[02:42:38.200 --> 02:42:43.240]  hour by computer algorithms and automatic you know automatic buys and
[02:42:43.240 --> 02:42:47.240]  sells ups and downs the amount of administration that's going to be needed
[02:42:47.240 --> 02:42:52.200]  to administrate such a tax is going to be massive it's going to create jobs for
[02:42:52.200 --> 02:42:57.880]  certain people obviously the people who are into bureaucracies and into being
[02:42:57.880 --> 02:43:02.480]  called technocracy lots of jobs for them and then any money left over will be in
[02:43:02.480 --> 02:43:06.600]  the slush fund which will be for the banks this exact plan came out at the
[02:43:06.600 --> 02:43:12.800]  Copenhagen conference in 2009 to create a global slush fund by a carbon tax that
[02:43:12.800 --> 02:43:16.800]  money was going to be handled by the World Bank it's the exact same thing
[02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:21.240]  that is your Robin Hood tax if anybody has any questions as to whether that
[02:43:21.240 --> 02:43:24.760]  will or won't happen take a look at the amount of bailouts that have happened
[02:43:24.760 --> 02:43:31.840]  since 2008 in the United States and in Europe in coding to this day and they
[02:43:31.840 --> 02:43:36.560]  should have no illusions whatsoever as to what's going to happen with such a
[02:43:36.560 --> 02:43:41.000]  slush fund so and you know these are people arguing about a Robin Hood tax
[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:44.440]  here who basically a lot of them are unemployed or they're right on the
[02:43:44.440 --> 02:43:49.320]  poverty the new the modern developed world poverty level and they're arguing
[02:43:49.320 --> 02:43:53.640]  about oh maybe we should have a Robin Hood tax instead of anybody at these
[02:43:53.640 --> 02:43:57.720]  occupy movements and I've yet to hear anybody say why don't we cut spending
[02:43:57.720 --> 02:44:02.560]  why does Britain need to upgrade its trident nuclear submarine missile
[02:44:02.560 --> 02:44:07.000]  program that's going to cost billions why does the US why did Obama pass the
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:13.080]  bill for 200 billion to upgrade the United States nuclear arsenal there's a
[02:44:13.080 --> 02:44:16.800]  lot of places we can cut spending Ron Paul will tell you he can balance the
[02:44:16.800 --> 02:44:22.680]  budget by bringing home the troops and closing 200 odd 300 odd military base
[02:44:22.680 --> 02:44:27.800]  that the US has overseas so obviously we can balance the budget so if you're
[02:44:27.800 --> 02:44:31.640]  going to talk about solutions and this is something that the occupy movements
[02:44:31.640 --> 02:44:36.320]  have to start doing is solutions thank transfer day cut spending start with the
[02:44:36.320 --> 02:44:42.080]  simple stuff and then work your way up well I agree with what you say there
[02:44:42.080 --> 02:44:46.520]  Patrick let's bring some callers into the picture here we've got Scott and
[02:44:46.520 --> 02:44:52.960]  Vermont I believe has been holding the longest are you there Scott
[02:44:52.960 --> 02:44:59.880]  well hello hi Scott welcome to the program oh sorry I'm just gonna is the
[02:44:59.880 --> 02:45:05.360]  Aaron this is Aaron here and we've got Patrick in I'm sorry okay I want to bring
[02:45:05.360 --> 02:45:08.480]  up the Council on Foreign Relations you know Joe Salete was on with Alex
[02:45:08.480 --> 02:45:13.840]  yesterday and brought up how the Goldman Sachs is behind every treasury head
[02:45:13.840 --> 02:45:20.320]  since the eye under Clinton Rubin and Mr. Paulson under Bush and and now Mr.
[02:45:20.320 --> 02:45:24.160]  Geithner and all and there else up to be Council for Relations members they're
[02:45:24.160 --> 02:45:28.040]  all CFR members and all the key positions including Secretary of State
[02:45:28.040 --> 02:45:32.000]  Hillary Clinton technically is not but she might as well be a CFR members in
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:37.400]  with Mr. Obama but I also noticed that they they kind of have us coming you
[02:45:37.400 --> 02:45:40.120]  know we know they want a one-world government I brought this up with a
[02:45:40.120 --> 02:45:43.880]  Peter Galbraith who's a state senator here in Vermont and he tried to tell me
[02:45:43.880 --> 02:45:47.560]  oh it's just a boring talk group I brought up that the fact that his own
[02:45:47.560 --> 02:45:53.000]  father the famous John Kenneth Galbraith economist under and diplomat under FDR
[02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:58.440]  and Kennedy he quit the CFR under and discussed at the undue influence of it
[02:45:58.440 --> 02:46:04.040]  and and I said that now they do want a one-world government he said that they
[02:46:04.040 --> 02:46:08.160]  show me proof of that and and I'll renounce them publicly so Aaron maybe
[02:46:08.160 --> 02:46:12.120]  a few in your writing maybe you can put together some all the evidence that not
[02:46:12.120 --> 02:46:16.360]  only CFR top members have talked about the one-world government and destroying
[02:46:16.360 --> 02:46:20.760]  our sovereignty and our Constitution to get their their goal but the evidence
[02:46:20.760 --> 02:46:26.440]  that the CFR they they they as a body they try not to say that no we're for
[02:46:26.440 --> 02:46:30.240]  one-world government and all that but they basically are and they openly are
[02:46:30.240 --> 02:46:34.240]  in their founding but they've trained us to lay over and just assume nothing's
[02:46:34.240 --> 02:46:38.480]  going on there while simultaneously accepting all the recommendations and
[02:46:38.480 --> 02:46:43.000]  their subpanels for this whole host of issues I mean they just rule us
[02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:46.440]  intellectually because they're all part of that organized fellow travelers
[02:46:46.440 --> 02:46:50.320]  crowd and yeah they're steering this whole thing it's part of the larger
[02:46:50.320 --> 02:46:55.680]  system that we always talk about Patrick your comments yeah I mean you don't
[02:46:55.680 --> 02:46:59.600]  need to prove it and I appreciate what your callers saying actually the proof
[02:46:59.600 --> 02:47:03.400]  is already out there the proof is out there you just type in global governance
[02:47:03.400 --> 02:47:07.880]  into Google and you'll get a hundred or two hundred pages with lots of articles
[02:47:07.880 --> 02:47:13.520]  you'll get CFR policy papers you'll get lots of think tanks in Washington who
[02:47:13.520 --> 02:47:19.120]  have tabled all these things there's seminars going on right now all around
[02:47:19.120 --> 02:47:22.480]  the United States and all around the world with delegates coming from all
[02:47:22.480 --> 02:47:26.280]  different countries and you know the climate conference is a perfect
[02:47:26.280 --> 02:47:30.800]  example at the climate the whole climate conference the UN
[02:47:30.800 --> 02:47:36.000]  Copenhagen and Mexico City and all these conferences are basically they're
[02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:39.840]  laying out the template right in front of you right in front of your eyes they're
[02:47:39.840 --> 02:47:43.960]  laying out the template for global government so and they've used the
[02:47:43.960 --> 02:47:48.320]  the climate issue or the global warming the apocalypse of global warming they've
[02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:52.880]  used this as the pretext to say we need a global government this is not
[02:47:52.880 --> 02:47:57.280]  something that individual countries can be trusted to take care of but as far as
[02:47:57.280 --> 02:48:01.960]  national sovereignty goes every country in Europe should know should really know
[02:48:01.960 --> 02:48:08.200]  by now that if you give up the ability to at least print your own currency and to
[02:48:08.200 --> 02:48:13.280]  be in charge of your own money you have no sovereignty whatsoever Greece has no
[02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:18.480]  sovereignty Greece is ruled by Brussels and this European Central Bank and
[02:48:18.480 --> 02:48:24.040]  Portugal is ruled by Brussels Ireland is ruled by Brussels the only country that
[02:48:24.040 --> 02:48:29.440]  has not opted into the single currency was the UK and that is not by mistake and
[02:48:29.440 --> 02:48:33.120]  they like to spin that in the media is that oh Britain's just been on the fence
[02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:37.240]  forever and Britain never intended to go into the single currency because the
[02:48:37.240 --> 02:48:42.080]  city in London and the banks here in the financial district are the ones who are
[02:48:42.080 --> 02:48:46.840]  profit-e-profit team off the misery of all these other smaller countries they
[02:48:46.840 --> 02:48:51.120]  have taken all these junk bonds in they've been triple A rated and are
[02:48:51.120 --> 02:48:57.000]  insured by credit default swaps and things like this and they've basically
[02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:01.960]  taken the bait they have no sovereignty so and likewise in the United States the
[02:49:01.960 --> 02:49:06.120]  United States was founded on a union of 50 states and the federal government was
[02:49:06.120 --> 02:49:11.000]  there like a housing association a sort of organization was there to make sure
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:15.640]  all the tenants or all the 50 states were happy and to regulate interstate
[02:49:15.640 --> 02:49:20.400]  disputes and so forth and also to regulate trade in and out of the United
[02:49:20.400 --> 02:49:27.080]  States so America's last vestige of sovereignty lies in each 50 states
[02:49:27.080 --> 02:49:31.800]  ability to be sovereign states and we've seen the trend of the federal
[02:49:31.800 --> 02:49:36.000]  government basically taking all that away and with that goes the Constitution
[02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:39.960]  so sovereignty is a big issue and it's happening right in front of us it's not
[02:49:39.960 --> 02:49:44.880]  rocket science it's quite simple and I agree Patrick and just to reiterate what
[02:49:44.880 --> 02:49:49.560]  you're saying just on the geoengineering issue the CFR has steered that whole
[02:49:49.560 --> 02:49:53.720]  debate they won't regulate the testing of this geoengineering stuff instead they
[02:49:53.720 --> 02:49:58.400]  want a new global mechanism to regulate it and here we have the CFR quote saying
[02:49:58.400 --> 02:50:02.800]  the goal should be to redefine sovereignty for the era of globalization to
[02:50:02.800 --> 02:50:06.800]  find a balance between a world of fully sovereign states and an international
[02:50:06.800 --> 02:50:11.240]  system of either either world government or anarchy and that says quite a lot
[02:50:11.240 --> 02:50:14.080]  right there we're coming up on a break we're going to take more calls
[02:50:14.080 --> 02:50:22.240]  and Nixon will be with us let's jam in real quick Brian in Alaska hi hi hi I'm

[02:54:10.560 --> 02:54:18.520]  fell into a burning ring of fire I went down down down and the flames went higher
[02:54:18.520 --> 02:54:24.960]  and it burns burns burns the ring of fire we are back on the Alex Jones show
[02:54:24.960 --> 02:54:29.360]  Aaron Dyke sitting in and here we are in the last segment and there's breaking
[02:54:29.360 --> 02:54:32.800]  news I'm gonna go back to the caller he brought up an important point about how
[02:54:32.800 --> 02:54:37.280]  the sports stadiums are the holding facilities for the FEMA relocation
[02:54:37.280 --> 02:54:41.600]  centers I witnessed that personally when we investigated in Denver but I think
[02:54:41.600 --> 02:54:45.440]  I'm gonna have to do the first ever few minutes of overdrive here because
[02:54:45.440 --> 02:54:50.080]  Salente Gerald Salente has sent us breaking information on the CMA's
[02:54:50.080 --> 02:54:54.920]  executive chairman who's issued a statement regarding how no customer has
[02:54:54.920 --> 02:55:00.720]  ever lost a penny as a result of a member defaulting in the CME group of
[02:55:00.720 --> 02:55:05.920]  course we know there was money loss with the MF global entity it says since we
[02:55:05.920 --> 02:55:09.320]  are the guarantor of every transaction that happens in our markets we have to
[02:55:09.320 --> 02:55:13.520]  guarantee the performance of each and every one of these contracts Salente
[02:55:13.520 --> 02:55:17.280]  comments here's the deal not only have customers lost money they've lost their
[02:55:17.280 --> 02:55:22.120]  futures positions as well and more importantly CMA did not honor its
[02:55:22.120 --> 02:55:26.000]  guarantee there's a video we're gonna play it in overdrive will take
[02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:29.920]  Henningson's comments as well if he could stick with this but it is important to
[02:55:29.920 --> 02:55:33.760]  point out that we're gonna cover this on the Info Wars nightly news tonight Rob
[02:55:33.760 --> 02:55:37.240]  Dew's gonna cover it Kurt Nemo has written an article it's up at info wars
[02:55:37.240 --> 02:55:42.800]  dot com Salente CMA did not guarantee oversight MMF global scandal so we're
[02:55:42.800 --> 02:55:46.520]  gonna get into that a little into overdrive and especially tonight on the
[02:55:46.520 --> 02:55:50.960]  Info Wars nightly news you don't want to miss it I forgot the name of the caller
[02:55:50.960 --> 02:55:59.480]  but let's go back to him please was it Noah Ryan oh Brian I'm sorry yeah I was
[02:55:59.480 --> 02:56:04.080]  saying that the sports facilities are the relocation camps and I urge everyone
[02:56:04.080 --> 02:56:08.520]  to go on Google Earth or Google Maps and look up their local sports complex and
[02:56:08.520 --> 02:56:14.480]  see how close it is to a National Guard outpost and also prison up here the
[02:56:14.480 --> 02:56:19.240]  prison is about a one-minute drive and the National Guard complex is connected
[02:56:19.240 --> 02:56:23.320]  to it and it's actually an armory and the way is if you look at it it looks like
[02:56:23.320 --> 02:56:28.120]  a prison camp but I know they'll tell it as a disaster type thing because our
[02:56:28.120 --> 02:56:32.840]  governor was telling us to get ready for civil unrest and stuff like that sorry
[02:56:32.840 --> 02:56:37.080]  I'm nervous though I just really hope you guys do like a full expose they own
[02:56:37.080 --> 02:56:39.560]  this I'm about to send you a whole bunch of stuff but I know you guys have more
[02:56:39.560 --> 02:56:43.760]  and um yeah you can speak on this a lot but I'm nervous too about what's
[02:56:43.760 --> 02:56:47.480]  happening in this country I can speak to this firsthand because I covered
[02:56:47.480 --> 02:56:51.240]  Operation Mountain Guardian in Denver where they simulated a terrorist attack
[02:56:51.240 --> 02:56:55.800]  on a mall they simulated school shooting and all that was sort of like
[02:56:55.800 --> 02:56:59.880]  semi-open to the press and the public but what was secret in the drill was
[02:56:59.880 --> 02:57:05.600]  that they were drilling taking these students to the sports stadium in Denver
[02:57:05.600 --> 02:57:09.120]  there at the Mile High Stadium which has been kind of renamed and recoopted and
[02:57:09.120 --> 02:57:13.960]  they're real secretive and weird about how they were doing drills about role
[02:57:13.960 --> 02:57:18.000]  playing parents picking up role-playing children from there and they really
[02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:21.280]  didn't want us to get into it but we spoke with a member of the police
[02:57:21.280 --> 02:57:25.120]  department and some Homeland Security people who admitted that was the goal
[02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:28.400]  to get the children there and reunite them with the parents at the sports
[02:57:28.400 --> 02:57:32.320]  stadium in any kind of disaster whether it's a drill or a real one an
[02:57:32.320 --> 02:57:36.240]  incredible call police in this that information Brian we only have a moment
[02:57:36.240 --> 02:57:39.720]  left but we are going to go into overdrive and cover the breaking
[02:57:39.720 --> 02:57:44.280]  information on MF Global and what Gerald Salente has brought to the table
[02:57:44.280 --> 02:57:49.920]  your closing comments Henningson. As far as MF Global goes whenever there's a
[02:57:49.920 --> 02:57:54.080]  crisis something going on the news if it hits me personally or if it hits a
[02:57:54.080 --> 02:57:57.720]  friend of mine who I who I know personally then I know that this must be
[02:57:57.720 --> 02:58:02.560]  endemic it must be widespread I sat down with a good friend of mine in London
[02:58:02.560 --> 02:58:09.160]  yesterday and he told me he lost 150,000 from MF Global and basically
[02:58:09.160 --> 02:58:14.480]  what happened with MF Global I posted a New York Times story which hinted on
[02:58:14.480 --> 02:58:18.480]  there on this site tonight they wiped out all the small to medium investors these
[02:58:18.480 --> 02:58:21.600]  are all the retirement okay Patrick please hold your thoughts I hope you
[02:58:21.600 --> 02:58:25.240]  could stay with us five minutes into overdrive you'll hear us there on the

[03:00:35.840 --> 03:00:39.560]  what I can of it. We're going to do in-depth coverage tonight on the InfoWars

[03:00:51.480 --> 03:00:55.440]  friends to help us grow this broadcast. Now Kurt Nemo just put out the article
[03:00:55.440 --> 03:01:01.920]  Solente CMA did not guarantee oversight in MF global scandal. Bloomberg reports
[03:01:01.920 --> 03:01:06.960]  today that CME the world's largest futures exchange may face liability in
[03:01:06.960 --> 03:01:10.800]  the MF global scam that has built customers out of nearly a billion dollars.
[03:01:10.800 --> 03:01:15.840]  Back on October 30th it was reported that CME noticed a shortfall in MF
[03:01:15.840 --> 03:01:20.280]  global segregated client funds but did not immediately reported to the
[03:01:20.280 --> 03:01:25.680]  Commodity Futures Trading Commission and they were supposed to oversee it and
[03:01:25.680 --> 03:01:31.040]  their behavior is suspect especially suspect after 600 million fell into a
[03:01:31.040 --> 03:01:36.040]  black hole and there were reports too that the money went to JPMorgan. Paul
[03:01:36.040 --> 03:01:40.520]  Joseph Watson also wrote earlier today on the same issue of how the missing
[03:01:40.520 --> 03:01:45.200]  money was reportedly sent to JPMorgan and there's suspicions also reported in
[03:01:45.200 --> 03:01:49.600]  plenty of other newspapers including the New York Times. Now Gerald Solente
[03:01:49.600 --> 03:01:53.600]  contacted us during a break and here's a video we're gonna play it I would
[03:01:53.600 --> 03:01:57.000]  imagine in just a moment here and then we'll get Patrick Henningson's comments
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:02:00.960]  regarding how they were supposed to guarantee these transactions but
[03:02:00.960 --> 03:02:05.000]  apparently did not and have even compromised the future positions. You
[03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:08.720]  know why Solente is angry but we should all be mad about this and as Henningson
[03:02:08.720 --> 03:02:13.240]  said it's going on systematically in other entities as well. Do we have that
[03:02:13.240 --> 03:02:20.280]  clip ready guys? Okay let's go to it right now. It's worth pointing out that there
[03:02:20.280 --> 03:02:24.040]  are some segments of our financial market that provided a place of shelter
[03:02:24.040 --> 03:02:28.480]  for the most damaging parts of the economic crisis. Futures and options
[03:02:28.480 --> 03:02:32.520]  markets are chief among them. They function flawlessly providing liquidity,
[03:02:32.520 --> 03:02:36.600]  transparency and central counterparty clearing services that continued to work
[03:02:36.600 --> 03:02:41.480]  throughout the crisis. No customer has ever lost a penny as a result of a
[03:02:41.480 --> 03:02:46.040]  clearing member default at CME Group and that includes the Great Depression up
[03:02:46.040 --> 03:02:50.520]  through the most recent economic failure. Even though CME Group and our fellow
[03:02:50.520 --> 03:02:55.080]  exchanges are headquartered in Chicago our businesses are truly global. We
[03:02:55.080 --> 03:02:58.760]  continue to dramatically expand our businesses as a consequence of
[03:02:58.760 --> 03:03:03.200]  distributing our products worldwide. At CME alone we now serve customers in more
[03:03:03.200 --> 03:03:07.440]  than 85 countries. We serve them to the CME Globex the most distributed
[03:03:07.440 --> 03:03:11.040]  electronic trading platform in the world. We are standing here today at the
[03:03:11.040 --> 03:03:15.200]  nerve center of this global operation. What you see around you is the new state
[03:03:15.200 --> 03:03:18.680]  of the art global command center for which CME Globex operates around the
[03:03:18.680 --> 03:03:22.920]  clock to serve our clients. Roughly 60% of our employees are involved in
[03:03:22.920 --> 03:03:27.680]  technology supporting this operation. In fact we have invested more than 1.5
[03:03:27.680 --> 03:03:32.360]  billion dollars over the past several years much of that deployed right here
[03:03:32.360 --> 03:03:38.280]  in Chicago. To give you a sense of the scale last year we traded 2.6 billion
[03:03:38.280 --> 03:03:42.240]  contracts representing an underlying value of more than 800 trillion
[03:03:42.240 --> 03:03:46.800]  dollars and since we are the guarantor of every transactions that happens in our
[03:03:46.800 --> 03:03:50.800]  markets we have to guarantee the performance of each and every one of
[03:03:50.800 --> 03:03:55.800]  these contracts which means facilitating the transfer of 800 trillion
[03:03:55.800 --> 03:04:00.560]  dollars of risk. Okay that goes on from there but but that's the
[03:04:00.560 --> 03:04:04.800]  Chicago mercantile exchange and their global exchange and you heard the man
[03:04:04.800 --> 03:04:08.880]  they were supposed to guarantee these transactions and yet this money has gone
[03:04:08.880 --> 03:04:13.120]  missing after these bad bets co-resigned the former Goldman Sachs
[03:04:13.120 --> 03:04:17.040]  executive as well as senator and governor of New Jersey has stepped down.
[03:04:17.040 --> 03:04:22.320]  Did he have a scandalous role in this? Definitely a question worth asking and
[03:04:22.320 --> 03:04:26.640]  Salente again very angrily points out that not only have customers lost money
[03:04:26.640 --> 03:04:31.120]  but they've also lost their future positions and more importantly CME did
[03:04:31.120 --> 03:04:35.760]  not honor its quote guarantee. So that's a big thing and we're going to get all
[03:04:35.760 --> 03:04:39.400]  into it tonight on the Info Wars Nightly News so I really hope you tune in for
[03:04:39.400 --> 03:04:43.360]  that. We'll stay on the other side of this break get a few final words from

[03:04:48.040 --> 03:04:51.840]  censored and obscured information the globalists don't want you to put the

[03:08:16.280 --> 03:08:21.000]  we just wanted to cover the unfolding scandal with MF Global and surely many
[03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:27.080]  other entities as these banks and hedge fund places and betting places are
[03:08:27.080 --> 03:08:33.880]  coming up short on their economic thing bets as the whole system is so
[03:08:33.880 --> 03:08:39.160]  leveraged out that they can't even be called on their obligations and that's
[03:08:39.160 --> 03:08:43.360]  basically what's happened here you had a game of musical chairs come to a stop
[03:08:43.360 --> 03:08:47.920]  and they were short not of the globalist money none of the elites not the big
[03:08:47.920 --> 03:08:52.880]  billionaire players who got word to apparently move their money before MF
[03:08:52.880 --> 03:08:57.400]  Global in particular went bankrupt you had regular customers losing their funds
[03:08:57.400 --> 03:09:02.120]  and you've heard about it from Gerald Salente and now he's pointing out how the
[03:09:02.120 --> 03:09:07.320]  CME the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and other entities which were supposed to
[03:09:07.320 --> 03:09:11.320]  facilitate these transactions were not honoring their obligations and not
[03:09:11.320 --> 03:09:15.160]  keeping a proper eye on this and look who pays it's always the customer just
[03:09:15.160 --> 03:09:19.240]  as they steal from the pension funds the retirement benefits and all the rest of
[03:09:19.240 --> 03:09:23.880]  it and then you have places like Bank of America getting their 75 trillion in
[03:09:23.880 --> 03:09:29.120]  derivatives somehow FDIC insured I mean this is going to be a big problem when
[03:09:29.120 --> 03:09:32.440]  the music stops and they call them on these bets and they don't have the money
[03:09:32.440 --> 03:09:35.960]  it's going to be our money that's gone Patrick Kenningson I hope you're still
[03:09:35.960 --> 03:09:40.280]  on the line with us tell us what you think about this yeah I'm still here
[03:09:40.280 --> 03:09:44.720]  and look what you have with MF Global like what you have with a lot of
[03:09:44.720 --> 03:09:49.640]  institutions now it's a Ponzi scheme they didn't they basically move the money
[03:09:49.640 --> 03:09:53.440]  around and they pay out when when go when your gold contracts come up and
[03:09:53.440 --> 03:09:56.800]  you're expecting delivery for gold or silver they'll take the money out of
[03:09:56.800 --> 03:10:01.400]  someone else's account in order to get that obviously the people like you said
[03:10:01.400 --> 03:10:05.400]  the insiders got word early they got their money out but it's the middle
[03:10:05.400 --> 03:10:10.200]  class or the upper middle class or the small to medium-sized investors been
[03:10:10.200 --> 03:10:14.560]  wiped out there's been a big trend in the last few years and a lot of it is
[03:10:14.560 --> 03:10:18.040]  up to the work that you've been doing in Ted Anderson and people like that
[03:10:18.040 --> 03:10:21.760]  people have been getting into sound money they've been getting into gold and
[03:10:21.760 --> 03:10:26.480]  silver and my personal friend of mine was building a nest egg for his children
[03:10:26.480 --> 03:10:31.600]  so they had some inheritance when he passes away eventually or whatever he's
[03:10:31.600 --> 03:10:36.240]  got a future for his kids that future has been wiped out this week to the tune
[03:10:36.240 --> 03:10:41.360]  of 150 grand and what it is also it's basically I believe the MF Global
[03:10:41.360 --> 03:10:46.880]  takedown was a planned takedown they've managed to knock out a huge section of
[03:10:46.880 --> 03:10:51.520]  the middle class and people who are into metals and who are into safe commodities
[03:10:51.520 --> 03:10:55.920]  and smart investors they've been knocked out and a lot of that is that part of
[03:10:55.920 --> 03:11:00.400]  the trend that was seeing all over the place it's the elimination of the middle
[03:11:00.400 --> 03:11:05.120]  class and any new regulations that come to play will be coming to play to hurt
[03:11:05.120 --> 03:11:09.480]  the small banks the regional banks the credit unions the middle class investors
[03:11:09.480 --> 03:11:14.480]  the small businesses this is what the globalists want to annihilate they want
[03:11:14.480 --> 03:11:19.080]  to smash that up into as many small parts as they can so that it's a rigged
[03:11:19.080 --> 03:11:23.800]  game you got to have money to make money you cannot work your way up the system
[03:11:23.800 --> 03:11:29.240]  a middle class is a feature of an advanced civilization once you lose the
[03:11:29.240 --> 03:11:33.720]  middle class or the upwardly mobile class and all you left with is a giant
[03:11:33.720 --> 03:11:38.960]  underclass and a very small elite class and that is the process that we are
[03:11:38.960 --> 03:11:42.960]  seeing right now these things do not happen by accident I don't believe they
[03:11:42.960 --> 03:11:46.120]  do and I think even if you probably have quite a few listeners out there
[03:11:46.120 --> 03:11:51.960]  listening to this show right now who also lost money in this recent takedown so I
[03:11:51.960 --> 03:11:59.280]  think I don't know what to say it's it's it's cutting no I agree entirely and
[03:11:59.280 --> 03:12:02.400]  you're totally right they're wiping out the middle class while they're
[03:12:02.400 --> 03:12:06.120]  reconsolidating wealth for that ultra-rich and it seems like only the
[03:12:06.120 --> 03:12:10.600]  crooked rise to the top well all I could say is we're going to stay tuned on
[03:12:10.600 --> 03:12:16.280]  this Rob do was already playing to cover in-depth all this stuff on MF global and
[03:12:16.280 --> 03:12:21.240]  it's related scandals with JP Morgan and all the rest of it and I don't know if
[03:12:21.240 --> 03:12:24.840]  Salente will be in contact but we're going to try to see if he has anything
[03:12:24.840 --> 03:12:29.040]  else to add and what he's calling the smoking gun that the CME group was
[03:12:29.040 --> 03:12:32.920]  supposed to be guaranteeing these transactions and it's all falling apart
[03:12:32.920 --> 03:12:37.320]  now and like you said ordinary investors medium-level investors and so forth
[03:12:37.320 --> 03:12:41.920]  people trying to plan for the future that's who's getting wiped out or if as
[03:12:41.920 --> 03:12:48.720]  they report maybe taking a 40% haircut Patrick yeah I mean look haircut I know
[03:12:48.720 --> 03:12:53.680]  haircut the word insider trading used to be considered a crime it used to be
[03:12:53.680 --> 03:12:58.480]  something that you could actually catch people for the global racetrack casino
[03:12:58.480 --> 03:13:03.840]  economy that we have right now it is all insider trading Washington insider
[03:13:03.840 --> 03:13:09.160]  trading congressmen have immunity from insider trading laws that's come out
[03:13:09.160 --> 03:13:13.720]  also this week with and also with the 60 minute report earlier in the week look
[03:13:13.720 --> 03:13:18.320]  it's all insider trading there's no rule of law in the global financial casino I
[03:13:18.320 --> 03:13:23.760]  cannot walk into a casino in Vegas with and you know put a thousand dollar bet
[03:13:23.760 --> 03:13:30.660]  down on the blackjack table and buy it for $10 you know but yet if you're in
[03:13:30.660 --> 03:13:34.080]  Wall Street you can do this and who's going to pick up the tab if there's a
[03:13:34.080 --> 03:13:38.520]  loss the taxpayer will pick up the tab or will pay for it in the form of
[03:13:38.520 --> 03:13:44.000]  inflation so the whole game is rigged and all these occupy Wall Street people
[03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:48.800]  occupy London people they need to take a look at the monetary system that should
[03:13:48.800 --> 03:13:53.840]  be a primary focus how much is rated how debt is created if they're not doing
[03:13:53.840 --> 03:13:57.280]  that they're personally I think they're wasting their time they need to get
[03:13:57.280 --> 03:14:01.160]  educated on the history of money you can watch the money masters for free on
[03:14:01.160 --> 03:14:05.280]  on you on YouTube there's a lot of great films out there freedom to fascism by
[03:14:05.280 --> 03:14:08.840]  Aaron Russo you need if you know about these things you need to start passing
[03:14:08.840 --> 03:14:12.280]  them right now to people who don't know about these things and people need to
[03:14:12.280 --> 03:14:15.880]  get educated otherwise you're in the dark and if you're in the dark and you're
[03:14:15.880 --> 03:14:18.840]  complaining that you don't like the system then I can't have a lot of
[03:14:18.840 --> 03:14:22.320]  sympathy for you because the information is out there we live in a digital
[03:14:22.320 --> 03:14:26.720]  information age people need to start taking advantage of that now so if you
[03:14:26.720 --> 03:14:29.920]  have this info get it out to your friends get it out to your family because
[03:14:29.920 --> 03:14:35.120]  they might actually be in line to be knocked out in an MF global type collapse
[03:14:35.120 --> 03:14:39.120]  in the future with another institution you need to get ahead of the curve don't
[03:14:39.120 --> 03:14:42.200]  be behind the curve get ahead of the curve that's what we're trying to do
