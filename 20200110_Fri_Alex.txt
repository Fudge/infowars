[00:00.000 --> 00:16.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:16.000 --> 00:22.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide on this January 10th, 2020 worldwide
[00:22.000 --> 00:23.000]  transmission.
[00:23.000 --> 00:28.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones, we're gonna lay out the scientific technocrats who they are
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.000]  and how they're trying to artificially take control of human evolution.
[00:31.000 --> 00:33.000]  That's their term.
[00:33.000 --> 00:41.000]  Back in 2019, Sundar Pachai, the CEO of Google, told Congress while I was in the committee room
[00:41.000 --> 00:48.000]  that they've never gamed or rigged any search result in the history of Google.
[00:48.000 --> 00:54.000]  That's like saying the sun has never set or never risen over the planet Earth.
[00:54.000 --> 01:00.000]  It was a spectacular bald-faced lie and exercise in complete deception.
[01:00.000 --> 01:06.000]  And now here we are, a year later, and the number one podcast of 2019 was my appearance
[01:06.000 --> 01:07.000]  on the Joe Rogan Experience.
[01:07.000 --> 01:13.000]  In fact, it's the number one long-form podcast in YouTube history.
[01:13.000 --> 01:18.000]  And as soon as all these news articles were written about it being the number one podcast,
[01:18.000 --> 01:20.000]  what did Google do?
[01:20.000 --> 01:27.000]  They delisted it out of the Joe Rogan directory of most viewed.
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.000]  Imagine if somebody won a race car race and they just said, well, we're gonna take them
[01:32.000 --> 01:33.000]  out of the pole position.
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.000]  We're gonna take them out of the checkered flag.
[01:35.000 --> 01:37.000]  We're gonna say that they never won.
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.000]  That's beyond what the Soviets would do when they would kill somebody who was in the Soviet
[01:42.000 --> 01:50.000]  government of Lenin or Stalin and then they would airbrush their photo out of subsequent
[01:50.000 --> 01:52.000]  publications and newspapers.
[01:52.000 --> 01:54.000]  This is being done in real time by AI.
[01:54.000 --> 01:56.000]  It's being done across the board.
[01:56.000 --> 02:02.000]  And it's gaming elections, like Professor Robert Epstein has exposed.
[02:02.000 --> 02:09.000]  And simply by omitting results, Google, who is responsible now for over 90 percent of
[02:09.000 --> 02:18.000]  all internet queries for searches, can completely distort reality and manipulate minds.
[02:18.000 --> 02:25.000]  And when you look at what Google and its subdivision YouTube are doing, is they're particularly
[02:25.000 --> 02:31.000]  suppressing any information about Epstein and the Clintons and the sex trafficking and
[02:31.000 --> 02:36.000]  Dinecore and all of that information that's now coming out in the mainstream that we covered
[02:36.000 --> 02:38.000]  years ago.
[02:38.000 --> 02:43.000]  And so it is a badge of honor to be censored by these individuals, but the arrogance of
[02:43.000 --> 02:46.000]  corporate America to work in unison.
[02:46.000 --> 02:47.000]  It's not just Google doing it.
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.000]  Apple, when we had the number one news app two years ago, banned us.
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.000]  Number one in news.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  And they said, oh, it's curation.
[02:54.000 --> 02:56.000]  The public can't have this information.
[02:56.000 --> 03:01.000]  And again, that's exactly what Professor Robert Epstein has exposed.
[03:01.000 --> 03:07.000]  And we're seeing the 2020 election be stolen, be gamed right in front of us.
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.000]  And it's one of Trump's greatest failures in not taking action.
[03:11.000 --> 03:15.000]  And so if Joe Rogan doesn't respond to this, if the internet doesn't get upset about this,
[03:15.000 --> 03:17.000]  it's another test that we fail.
[03:17.000 --> 03:21.000]  And they won't just be delisting and shadow banning interviews.
[03:21.000 --> 03:28.000]  They'll be completely taking them down because they're popular, because the people resonate
[03:28.000 --> 03:35.000]  with them, because they're awakening humanity, not because their lies or fake news.
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.000]  And now we see comedians roasting Holly with the Golden Globes and telling them,
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  you're a bunch of perverts and pedophiles.
[03:42.000 --> 03:48.000]  And the comedians saying that, it's more views than the entire Golden Globes alone on YouTube.
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  And so the establishment knows the truth.
[03:50.000 --> 03:53.000]  And challenging the establishment is popular.
[03:53.000 --> 03:55.000]  That's why they're working so hard to suppress it.
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.000]  But that's why we've built Bandot Video.
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  That's why we've built newswords.com.
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  That's why we've supported other sites out there.
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.000]  They're telling the truth that we have our own independent systems to challenge the censorship
[04:07.000 --> 04:10.000]  and the authoritarianism and the establishment narrative.
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  But at the same time, they're working around the clock to actually shut us down
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.000]  and not even let us have access to the internet, not even let us have servers.
[04:18.000 --> 04:21.000]  Because obviously that's going to be the next level of the tyranny.
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.000]  It's physically removing our existence off even the darker corners
[04:25.000 --> 04:27.000]  or more hidden areas of the internet.
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  I know that Joe was under tremendous pressure not to have me on after my first podcast visit
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  was one of the biggest he ever did.
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  Where were we exposed in 2017?
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.000]  Jeffrey Epstein the pedophile rings?
[04:39.000 --> 04:43.000]  So Joe had a lot of courage in 2019 to have me on.
[04:43.000 --> 04:48.000]  But now more than ever, whether he likes it or not, he's been drafted into this conflict.
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.000]  And if he chooses to take that commission and stand up as an officer for liberty and freedom
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  and be a modern Paul Revere,
[04:54.000 --> 04:59.000]  Joe Rowling could change the world more than he's even done already.

[05:54.000 --> 05:59.000]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[06:25.000 --> 06:28.000]  News alert on the Jeffrey Epstein case.
[06:28.000 --> 06:31.000]  Accuser is speaking out to ABC News.
[06:31.000 --> 06:36.000]  In emotional accounts of the abuse they say they faced at his hands.
[06:36.000 --> 06:43.000]  As we're learning that surveillance footage from the night of Epstein's first suicide attempt has gone missing.
[06:43.000 --> 06:46.000]  Brian Yenis has the latest details, Brian.
[06:46.000 --> 06:49.000]  Melissa, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York,
[06:49.000 --> 06:55.000]  submitted a letter to court revealing that surveillance video from outside Jeffrey Epstein's jail cell
[06:55.000 --> 07:01.000]  on the night of his first alleged suicide attempt in July has been deleted
[07:01.000 --> 07:06.000]  because of clerical and, quote, technical errors by the Metropolitan Correctional Center.
[07:06.000 --> 07:14.000]  The letter reads in part, quote, the MCC inadvertently preserved video from the wrong tear within the MCC
[07:14.000 --> 07:18.000]  and as a result video from outside the defendant's cell no longer exists.
[07:18.000 --> 07:23.000]  Epstein's cellmate Nicholas Tartaglione on trial for a quadruple murder
[07:23.000 --> 07:29.000]  requested the surveillance video in court to prove that he did not beat up Epstein on July 23rd
[07:29.000 --> 07:35.000]  and that Epstein's injuries were instead the result of his first suicide attempt, as prosecutors believe.
[07:35.000 --> 07:39.000]  The problem is when the government requested a copy of the video to be saved,
[07:39.000 --> 07:46.000]  the MCC saved and recorded video from the wrong jail cell and video from the correct cell was deleted.
[07:46.000 --> 07:51.000]  Meantime, as the FBI continues its investigation into Epstein's former girlfriend
[07:51.000 --> 07:57.000]  and alleged Madame Gielin Maxwell last night on ABC, Epstein accuser Maria Farmer said
[07:57.000 --> 08:02.000]  Maxwell threatened her life after she and Epstein sexually assaulted her.
[08:02.000 --> 08:07.000]  I remember having some bruises. They didn't get my clothes off. They tried.
[08:07.000 --> 08:12.000]  I was in an absolute panic to the point where I was able to get myself up and get out of that room
[08:12.000 --> 08:17.000]  and Gielin came after me, but I literally took these big pieces of furniture
[08:17.000 --> 08:19.000]  and I pushed them against the doors.
[08:19.000 --> 08:23.000]  Melissa, Maxwell's whereabouts are still unknown.
[08:23.000 --> 08:25.000]  Wow, bright news.
[08:28.000 --> 08:33.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones
[08:33.000 --> 08:50.000]  coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[08:50.000 --> 08:57.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is January 10th, 2020 on this live Friday edition.
[08:57.000 --> 09:05.000]  We have several special guests joining us today, one in studio. I'll just leave it at that and surprise you.
[09:05.000 --> 09:13.000]  And we're going to also open the phones up a little bit later and take some phone calls.
[09:13.000 --> 09:21.000]  And we're going to cover the waterfront of news, but I was sitting here this morning about three hours ago
[09:21.000 --> 09:29.000]  and I was looking over the news and I was thinking to myself, what's the most important thing to cover?
[09:29.000 --> 09:32.000]  What's the most important thing with what's happening in the world?
[09:32.000 --> 09:39.000]  And it really just goes back to this. Are we building a pro-human future
[09:39.000 --> 09:46.000]  or an anti-human future that's inhospitable to the human race?
[09:46.000 --> 09:55.000]  And the answer is, and no one can deny this, that the entire corporate media, the entire Hollywood combine,
[09:55.000 --> 10:03.000]  the communist Chinese, the EU are all promoting a post-human world
[10:03.000 --> 10:07.000]  and that the family is bad and there is no God, but that God's are coming
[10:07.000 --> 10:11.000]  and they're going to be AI gods and they're going to replace us.
[10:11.000 --> 10:21.000]  Whether it's the different physicists they put on TV like Tyson or others,
[10:21.000 --> 10:26.000]  they say the same thing over and over again, we're obsolete, we're dead, we're gone.
[10:26.000 --> 10:31.000]  We should all just give up and take some high-powered prescription drugs and just fade out.
[10:31.000 --> 10:34.000]  And a lot of people nihilistically are deciding to do that.
[10:34.000 --> 10:39.000]  You're seeing record suicide, not just here, but across the world because we're being told humans suck, we're bad.
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.000]  The world without humans is going to be a great thing.
[10:41.000 --> 10:46.000]  That's what young people are being taught, record suicide there.
[10:46.000 --> 10:52.000]  It's the prosperity that's killing us, Victor Hugo said.
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.000]  Adversity makes men, prosperity makes monsters.
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.000]  And we really are becoming monsters, aren't we?
[10:59.000 --> 11:04.000]  Slovenly, weak, stupid, no-attention spans, myself included.
[11:04.000 --> 11:09.000]  Because we're not involved in the animating contest of liberty, we're not pushing ourselves,
[11:09.000 --> 11:14.000]  we're drowned in all this buzz of information, most of it false.
[11:14.000 --> 11:23.000]  But here on this broadcast, when I'm focused and I'm really putting my nose to the grindstone,
[11:23.000 --> 11:29.000]  there is no better analysis of what's really happening on this planet
[11:29.000 --> 11:33.000]  and what the different countervailing forces are, nowhere.
[11:33.000 --> 11:41.000]  And that's why I really have decided to do more focused special reports where I've put on my complete A game
[11:41.000 --> 11:47.000]  like we did a few weeks ago with the Jeffrey Epstein special that was an hour long.
[11:47.000 --> 11:53.000]  And so I'm committing to you in this new year and you've already seen it that I'm going to do even more live shows.
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.000]  I'm going to do more special broadcasts.
[11:55.000 --> 11:58.000]  I'm going to do more special reports.
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.000]  But I basically shot that special report like it was live, taped to air.
[12:02.000 --> 12:06.000]  We lined up all the elements of it, took us about a week.
[12:06.000 --> 12:11.000]  Then it took us four hours to set it all up, up here at six, seven at night,
[12:11.000 --> 12:15.000]  and to shoot the thing at like eight at night.
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.000]  And then to stay up all night putting it together with documents and evidence
[12:19.000 --> 12:24.000]  and putting it out the next day on Christmas Eve.
[12:24.000 --> 12:30.000]  The labor and the focus of doing that and everybody coming together
[12:30.000 --> 12:36.000]  is incredibly satisfying way better than climbing a mountain,
[12:36.000 --> 12:42.000]  which I'm not rock climbed a mountain, but you know, I've climbed a 15,000 foot mountain from top to bottom.
[12:42.000 --> 12:46.000]  Better satisfaction than sex.
[12:46.000 --> 12:53.000]  Better satisfaction than seeing one of my children when they're six months old smiling at me
[12:53.000 --> 12:59.000]  because it's the satisfaction of building a better world for everybody, including my children.
[12:59.000 --> 13:04.000]  And it's the satisfaction of when you execute something right and it's strong
[13:04.000 --> 13:11.000]  and it's credible and it's true and it's powerful.
[13:11.000 --> 13:18.000]  And so I just want to talk today towards the end of this hour
[13:18.000 --> 13:26.000]  or maybe at the start of the next about what hit me last night and what hit me this morning
[13:26.000 --> 13:32.000]  and what I dreamed about all last night was the technocracy.
[13:32.000 --> 13:42.000]  And I woke up at about four in the morning with just a heavy weight of sorrow and dread
[13:42.000 --> 13:48.000]  from the dreams I was having that were very scientific laid out projections of the future
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.000]  and what's going to happen to humanity.
[13:50.000 --> 13:51.000]  It's not seeing the future.
[13:51.000 --> 13:55.000]  It's being able to see the elements building and what that future is going to look like.
[13:55.000 --> 14:03.000]  And then my brain wargaming it through from its inception to its construction to its implementation
[14:03.000 --> 14:09.000]  and then mass scale analysis and then right down to the individual scale
[14:09.000 --> 14:17.000]  watching the disintegration of humanity carried out in a very planned orderly fashion.
[14:17.000 --> 14:27.000]  And so I want to give a gestalt today in a few segments time both coming up in a few segments
[14:27.000 --> 14:36.000]  and in a few segments encapsulating it to really warn people
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.000]  because this isn't my opinion that this is what they're building.
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  This is who they are because I don't just look at what they're building
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.000]  and what they built so far or how they operate in different situations.
[14:45.000 --> 14:53.000]  I look at what they all say and how they're externalizing the method of writings 50, 60 years ago
[14:53.000 --> 14:59.000]  with this plan into writings that were public but not put out publicly.
[14:59.000 --> 15:07.000]  They were available publicly but not popularly distributed for proletariat consumption
[15:07.000 --> 15:10.000]  that are beyond nightmarish and now to be here 20 years later
[15:10.000 --> 15:13.000]  and we're exactly where they said they would have us.
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're marching into our graves just like concentration camp victims
[15:18.000 --> 15:23.000]  in those black and white films the Nazis shot themselves of running women, children, men,
[15:23.000 --> 15:29.000]  stripped their clothes off, put them in piles, run into those pits and they blow their heads off.
[15:29.000 --> 15:34.000]  But we're in slow motion running into that pit and I can tell you I'm not going to be part of it
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.000]  and I'm not just going to go kicking and screaming.
[15:38.000 --> 15:44.000]  We're going to put the globalists and their satanic plan in that pit and we're going to bury it.
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.000]  They are not going to pull this thing off. We cannot let them.
[15:47.000 --> 15:50.000]  But that's why they're banning us. That's why they're attacking us everywhere
[15:50.000 --> 15:53.000]  because the people working for the system have sold out to this thing
[15:53.000 --> 16:19.000]  and it's a pure evil from the pit of hell.
[16:19.000 --> 16:27.000]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS.
[16:27.000 --> 16:33.000]  Guess what? The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[16:33.000 --> 16:39.000]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less,
[16:39.000 --> 16:43.000]  call OMGTACS right now for a free tax-saving consultation.
[16:43.000 --> 16:57.000]  Call 800-486-8112-800-486-8112-800-486-8112. That's 800-486-8112.
[16:57.000 --> 17:01.000]  If you are trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[17:01.000 --> 17:05.000]  You don't know me and we'll never meet. I had a problem like you once.
[17:05.000 --> 17:12.000]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[17:12.000 --> 17:17.000]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[17:17.000 --> 17:22.000]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[17:22.000 --> 17:25.000]  you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[17:25.000 --> 17:32.000]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[17:32.000 --> 17:37.000]  And if you have PPO private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[17:37.000 --> 17:41.000]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[17:41.000 --> 17:44.000]  Get clean. Call now and learn more.
[17:44.000 --> 18:13.000]  800-506-6740-800-506-6740. That's 800-506-6740.
[18:14.000 --> 18:17.000]  What is the best? What gives people the best results?
[18:17.000 --> 18:21.000]  We either private label it or we develop our own with top developers.
[18:21.000 --> 18:26.000]  And folks, I'm telling you, you can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus.
[18:26.000 --> 18:30.000]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months. It's incredible.
[18:30.000 --> 18:34.000]  So do yourself a favor. Try out the products if you've been on the fence.
[18:34.000 --> 18:37.000]  You can't lose except if you don't take action.
[18:37.000 --> 18:41.000]  Because when you buy the products, you're funding the operation that is always delivering
[18:41.000 --> 18:44.000]  thanks to your support and God's grace and our action.
[18:44.000 --> 18:48.000]  But you need these products. That's the real reason you want to get them is because they're amazing.
[18:48.000 --> 18:52.000]  And then when you get great results, please tell others about it word of mouth.
[18:52.000 --> 18:56.000]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO instead of imploding.
[18:56.000 --> 18:59.000]  We're fighting to win and we are winning. Thanks to you.
[18:59.000 --> 19:05.000]  It's either happened to every person listening or it's happened to someone you know.
[19:05.000 --> 19:13.000]  Everybody is well aware of the fact that most people that end up getting the flu have taken the flu vaccine
[19:13.000 --> 19:19.000]  right before they get it and that they get the worst case of the flu of their life.
[19:19.000 --> 19:28.000]  But still, like concentration camp victims, they line up at the different pharmacies and clinics to get the injections.
[19:28.000 --> 19:34.000]  It doesn't matter that studies, mainline government studies in Canada and Europe show that when you take the flu vaccine,
[19:34.000 --> 19:39.000]  it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next season by lowering your immunity.
[19:39.000 --> 19:45.000]  It goes on and on. Or the fact that the governments have never guessed the next year's mutation
[19:45.000 --> 19:49.000]  that the flu vaccine has never, ever even worked.
[19:49.000 --> 19:53.000]  But how do you prop up a hoax? You keep the giant hoax going.
[19:53.000 --> 19:58.000]  No wonder we've got one of the worst flu seasons on record happening right now.
[19:58.000 --> 20:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:14.000 --> 20:19.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[20:19.000 --> 20:29.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[20:29.000 --> 20:35.000]  We are back live. We are broadcasting worldwide on this Friday transmission.
[20:35.000 --> 20:40.000]  I want to thank all the listeners for their support. We would not be here.
[20:40.000 --> 20:44.000]  Let me break down the news. I'm going to be covering here today.
[20:44.000 --> 20:50.000]  We have Norm Pattis, who's a very famous criminal lawyer and First Amendment lawyer.
[20:50.000 --> 20:54.000]  And he's going to be in studio with us coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[20:54.000 --> 20:59.000]  Then we have a lady who's an award-winning journalist who's been a political prisoner.
[20:59.000 --> 21:03.000]  Cynthia Farhot, if I'm pronouncing that correctly.
[21:03.000 --> 21:08.000]  And she has been on about a year or so. She was all in the middle of the Arab Spring, got arrested over in Egypt.
[21:08.000 --> 21:15.000]  She can break down with the Muslim Brotherhoods up to what's really happening when I ran from a very powerful perspective.
[21:15.000 --> 21:21.000]  She's an amazing lady, and she's going to be joining us coming up in the third hour.
[21:21.000 --> 21:32.000]  And Dr. Nick Begich is going to be hosting the fourth hour before the war room with the one, the only wild man, coxslayer Owen Troyer.
[21:32.000 --> 21:38.000]  And yes, wild horses can't rag me away. I'm going to be up here doing special reports this weekend.
[21:38.000 --> 21:41.000]  I'm going to be in studio doing the Sunday show. Owen did it last Sunday.
[21:41.000 --> 21:47.000]  That'll be four to six p.m. central time. So be sure and join us for that.
[21:47.000 --> 21:50.000]  Because every day we're on air is a miracle.
[21:50.000 --> 21:55.000]  Believe me, you don't know about 10% of what's going on. I don't say that as a victim.
[21:55.000 --> 22:00.000]  I say that because we're very, very proud of how much we've pissed off the New World Order.
[22:00.000 --> 22:07.000]  You know, we had a caller call into the show yesterday and talk about a Netflix show.
[22:07.000 --> 22:15.000]  A popular Netflix show that they're having a debate and argument at one point.
[22:15.000 --> 22:18.000]  And the guy says something and the other person says, oh, that's from Alan Jones.
[22:18.000 --> 22:23.000]  Everybody looks at me and goes, ah, you're an idiot. He looks down.
[22:23.000 --> 22:24.000]  And I was going to do a report on it.
[22:24.000 --> 22:30.000]  And I even ended up, somebody sent me the clip, but I got busy. But there's just too many of these shows
[22:30.000 --> 22:33.000]  and too many of these things to even keep track of.
[22:33.000 --> 22:38.000]  But they're trying to make my name like the CIA did in 1963, conspiracy theory.
[22:38.000 --> 22:41.000]  They came up with the term. It was declassified in the late 70s.
[22:41.000 --> 22:46.000]  And they ordered the media that if somebody questioned the JFK assassination,
[22:46.000 --> 22:50.000]  that you would use the term conspiracy theory and say, oh, they're a conspiracy theorist.
[22:50.000 --> 22:58.000]  That word doesn't work anymore. So they're making Alex Jones.
[22:58.000 --> 23:02.000]  They're making Alex Jones.
[23:02.000 --> 23:06.000]  The new word conspiracy.
[23:06.000 --> 23:10.000]  So it's a hit show called you on Netflix.
[23:10.000 --> 23:15.000]  And again, I've got the clip and even think about it, but I want to talk about it now.
[23:15.000 --> 23:20.000]  I don't have it in the computer. Maybe you guys can grab it. Do had it.
[23:20.000 --> 23:24.000]  But a caller called in and told us how they just insert.
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  Oh, you're having a debate. You're having an argument.
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  Well, guess what? You got it from Alex Jones.
[23:28.000 --> 23:30.000]  And that's like, whoa, it's over.
[23:30.000 --> 23:33.000]  Person that gets called Alex Jones is an idiot.
[23:33.000 --> 23:36.000]  And everybody has to, you know, laugh at him.
[23:36.000 --> 23:41.000]  And it's tailored for women and kind of the younger pop generation.
[23:41.000 --> 23:44.000]  But I know what's happening with the younger generation.
[23:44.000 --> 23:49.000]  Millennials are waking up, but particularly Generation Z and they all see right through this.
[23:49.000 --> 23:55.000]  And I asked the caller, I said, so you're watching this with your wife.
[23:55.000 --> 23:59.000]  He just said that. Yeah, I said, did that make her like me more or less?
[23:59.000 --> 24:03.000]  And he goes, no, she actually said, yeah, this is insane.
[24:03.000 --> 24:06.000]  Wow, what is this guy saying? I better tune in.
[24:06.000 --> 24:10.000]  It didn't make her look at her boyfriend and think he was an idiot because he likes Alex Jones.
[24:10.000 --> 24:15.000]  She's like, whoa, who is this dude? But see, that's what they do.
[24:15.000 --> 24:18.000]  And they just ridicule and they attack. And here's the thing.
[24:18.000 --> 24:21.000]  Why are they doing it if it's not working like it used to?
[24:21.000 --> 24:26.000]  Because it's all they've got and it used to work in the past.
[24:26.000 --> 24:27.000]  So I'm going to say it again.
[24:27.000 --> 24:32.000]  I don't want to make my show the center of attention about Alex Jones,
[24:32.000 --> 24:39.000]  but it's about the guest and the callers and the news and the crew and the reports and everything we do here.
[24:39.000 --> 24:44.000]  I'm just the curator.
[24:44.000 --> 24:48.000]  If you like to use a term that Tim Cook of Apple likes to use about me,
[24:48.000 --> 24:54.000]  but he meant it like a museum curator decides what's in the museum and what's not in the museum.
[24:54.000 --> 24:58.000]  But when it comes to curation, I don't even have curation going on.
[24:58.000 --> 25:01.000]  I open the wide open phones. I read your emails.
[25:01.000 --> 25:06.000]  I cover what you're actually saying because I value that.
[25:06.000 --> 25:09.000]  I want to know what the grassroots thinks.
[25:09.000 --> 25:14.000]  That's where the real understanding and innovation and change comes from.
[25:14.000 --> 25:17.000]  And that's where the solutions come from.
[25:17.000 --> 25:23.000]  And that's why they're trying to cut us off from each other and atomizes and isolates and make us dependent on them
[25:23.000 --> 25:28.000]  and make it where if you don't talk like they want you to and don't behave like they want you to
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.000]  and don't take the chemicals they want you to take and don't take the vaccines they want you to take
[25:32.000 --> 25:38.000]  and don't let them run your life and your body, they're going to cut you off from culture,
[25:38.000 --> 25:44.000]  from business, from money, from travel, from life, from reproducing.
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.000]  Well, that's a group that's got to be met with resistance.
[25:48.000 --> 25:57.000]  We've got to fight as hard as we can now while we still have some communities that are able to communicate on the internet
[25:57.000 --> 26:02.000]  before they incrementally close the door, which is happening right now.
[26:02.000 --> 26:12.000]  And Trump, I have to say, has been presiding over America losing control of the internet and losing control of our freedoms.
[26:12.000 --> 26:22.000]  And the little bitty things he's done, like the new trade negotiation to say that EU and others can't shut down our tech companies
[26:22.000 --> 26:30.000]  and don't have monopoly control over them, doesn't mean anything if Trump lets then the big tech companies operate
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.000]  above the Bill of Rights and Constitution and the political system and the American people.
[26:35.000 --> 26:43.000]  But we've seen a few good things from Trump, but on a scale of 1 to 10, I mean, I'll give Trump a 1
[26:43.000 --> 26:46.000]  and we need a 10 out of him on First Amendment and Free Speech.
[26:46.000 --> 26:49.000]  This is racketeering. This is a private company. You can do whatever it wants.
[26:49.000 --> 26:57.000]  This is a private company in real time with AI and real time censorship with people watching with the AI flags
[26:57.000 --> 27:03.000]  and controlling what we can say and do online.
[27:03.000 --> 27:08.000]  There's a report up on infowars.com.
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.000]  Google caught shadow banning Joe Rogan's number one podcast.
[27:12.000 --> 27:15.000]  And there's a video report I filed last night with Rob Do.
[27:15.000 --> 27:22.000]  I'd like to get it done.
[27:22.000 --> 27:28.000]  And it shows screenshots of Joe Rogan's YouTube page and how I was number one on it.
[27:28.000 --> 27:34.000]  And then if you check for Long Form Podcast, number one on YouTube, and if you check on iTunes, number one there,
[27:34.000 --> 27:41.000]  it systematically, and that's the other ringer I went and looked last night, it was systematically taken out of iTunes too.
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.000]  It's still there. You just can't find it.
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.000]  Now, think about the magnitude of that.
[27:48.000 --> 27:58.000]  They're like, well, Alex Jones went on Joe Rogan's show last February and he was the number one podcast of all time.
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.000]  And we can't have that at the top.
[28:00.000 --> 28:07.000]  Just like we just so happened to launch a news app on Apple and Google two months before we got banned two years ago.
[28:07.000 --> 28:12.000]  And it was already in the top 100 news apps in two months.
[28:12.000 --> 28:20.000]  It went to number one, not just in trending, number one above the New York Times, above CNN, above ABC News.
[28:20.000 --> 28:31.000]  And they can't have that because the knowledge of the crowd, the knowledge of we the people says we're curating things with our choices.
[28:31.000 --> 28:36.000]  And we pushed Alex Jones at the top because that's what we agree with.
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  That's who we are.
[28:38.000 --> 28:42.000]  And they said, no, you're not.
[28:42.000 --> 28:45.000]  We're going to force feed you this garbage.
[28:45.000 --> 28:51.000]  But now everywhere they go, people are in their face, whether it's the tech heads or whether it's the Hollywood trash.
[28:51.000 --> 28:55.000]  Everyone is rejecting them and censoring me and everybody else isn't going to save you.
[28:55.000 --> 29:06.000]  Stinking globalist self fellow patriots. My name is Todd Savage, founder of black rifle real estate.com. Like you, I was a prisoner of the out left sanctuary state.
[29:06.000 --> 29:09.000]  Until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.
[29:09.000 --> 29:16.000]  Today we live on a sustainable 20 acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.
[29:16.000 --> 29:22.000]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our black rifle real estate team is here to help.
[29:22.000 --> 29:27.000]  Go to black rifle real estate.com. That's black rifle real estate.com.
[29:52.000 --> 30:05.000]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the info war, but I know you're like me. You don't want my thanks.
[30:05.000 --> 30:11.000]  You want victory over the globalist and these devil worship and child molesters and you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[30:11.000 --> 30:15.000]  You know what? I'm the same way and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[30:15.000 --> 30:28.000]  And it's why info wars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to focus the people on taking action against the globalist because I'm committed to a future for humanity.
[30:28.000 --> 30:38.000]  And I know you are as well. So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the info war and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[30:38.000 --> 30:47.000]  For bottom my heart from my family and from the great crew at info wars. I want to thank you all because you are the info war and you know that's not just words. That's reality.
[30:47.000 --> 30:58.000]  You have made history. We have made history together info wars dot com only has power because of you and I suggest you use it.
[30:58.000 --> 31:11.000]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers from info wars. Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold.
[31:11.000 --> 31:20.000]  Not just in the U.S. worldwide and President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[31:20.000 --> 31:30.000]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against that in some other areas but tried to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist China.
[31:30.000 --> 31:44.000]  Trump's been doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective and the globalist are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way.
[31:44.000 --> 31:52.000]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[31:52.000 --> 31:58.000]  That's an attempt to demoralize us. We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[31:58.000 --> 32:17.000]  We have a new product and we got several thousand of these in and they're going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them. I want to thank the listeners for getting it but this really is a game changing toothpaste and it doesn't compete with super blue that's four to five a colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride free.
[32:17.000 --> 32:24.000]  The adult or the children's. These are both excellent toothpaste concentrates that don't have fillers. People love it.
[32:24.000 --> 32:33.000]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans but also re mineralizes the teeth.
[32:33.000 --> 32:41.000]  Then it has the patented silver salt silver in it to knock out the bacteria that causes ginger virus. This is all proven. You can make claims with this.
[32:41.000 --> 32:52.000]  But I have to tell you no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria the viruses and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[32:52.000 --> 32:58.000]  So we're really proud of it. It funds the operation in full or store.com. That's why we're still on air. Thanks to you.
[33:22.000 --> 33:30.000]  Remember that footage of my phone being remotely controlled and hacked. Well let's take a closer look.
[33:30.000 --> 33:41.000]  But this time let's actually see what the conversation was who it was with to see what the hacker seems to be so interested in.
[33:41.000 --> 33:51.000]  What would anyone care about what Tori and I are communicating about in private conversations to go so far as to hack my phone.
[33:51.000 --> 34:01.000]  Why did they come to me now three years later. I think I was pretty vocal. I heard the audio the day said rich died.
[34:01.000 --> 34:14.000]  I repeat I heard it. Why you come to me now three years later. Why. Oh it's because of the election fraud. It's because I told the world what you didn't want them to know.
[34:14.000 --> 34:30.000]  Oh that. Well that certainly explains why Tori received a subpoena in regards to a certain murdered DNC staffer.
[34:30.000 --> 34:50.000]  The DNC server debacle. Let's stop right there. I wanted to just play a minute or two of Millie Weaver's report because our reporters are doing such an incredible job.
[34:50.000 --> 35:04.000]  And they're breaking such important information. And so many times on the live broadcast we don't air it because it's a 20 minute report. It's incredible.
[35:04.000 --> 35:22.000]  I mean it's national news phones getting hacked and then subpoenas and they want to know about Seth Rich because of what the fraud investigator was able to find and how it ties into the DNC controlling computers across the country with software during elections.
[35:22.000 --> 35:34.000]  I can tell you the White House is aware and is in contact at high levels with Millie and the investigator. So that's that's just one little thing we're doing thanks to your support.
[35:34.000 --> 35:51.000]  And she is Millie Millie. She's been out there as an important reporter for eight years as a contractor. And we like to keep it that way to all the platforming because she's always been legitimately on her own and she's just doing so much good work.
[35:51.000 --> 36:00.000]  But how long until they do platform her or Caitlin Bennett because these ladies are doing incredible job. And again we're financing Caitlin Bennett and we're not bragging about that.
[36:00.000 --> 36:15.000]  I'm reporting to you what we're doing. And I could sit here all day and play you clips of what our reporters are doing. Exposing the insanity left exposing their corruption exposing their hunger for our children and destroy their innocence.
[36:15.000 --> 36:26.000]  Exposing them trying to take our guns destroy our borders bankrupt our country. And these are viral reports that all of our reporters are putting out and getting out.
[36:26.000 --> 36:37.000]  And it's all because of this mothership info wars. I got a lot of other big breaking news I want to hit but I want to just talk about what's happening on the ground. Let's go to this report from two days ago with our great reporter Savannah Hernandez.
[36:37.000 --> 36:46.000]  Let's just play the shorter boil down. Not the not the longer clip but this is Democrat socialists. That's how they describe themselves.
[36:46.000 --> 37:00.000]  Silence free speech during anti war rally in Austin. This went out live a few nights ago and then it was on Owen's war room the day after but this is the type of stuff we never get to where she's getting assaulted.
[37:00.000 --> 37:13.000]  She's getting attacked just a few weeks ago. In this case these people follow her around for hours. Even though she has an action seven night flag so they don't physically attack her if she's info wars.
[37:13.000 --> 37:22.000]  And then when she tries to talk to them they just stare at her and laugh and it's a man.
[37:22.000 --> 37:28.000]  She had two men come over and threatened to attack her.
[37:28.000 --> 37:35.000]  Just a few weeks ago we had the woman attack her attack her female camera person so bad.
[37:35.000 --> 37:43.000]  She said yes we want security and now they have security armed security with them when they go out. Now again we had armed security with Owen across the line at that same demonstration.
[37:43.000 --> 37:48.000]  People say where are your people in security. We had four security people with Owen and Savannah.
[37:48.000 --> 37:59.000]  But Savannah decided to go across into the leftist to interview them and she didn't incite them anything with an action seven might flag.
[37:59.000 --> 38:09.000]  And they still didn't like her didn't like her questions and physically assaulted her and hurt her female reporter Gabby her shoulder was hurt.
[38:09.000 --> 38:17.000]  That's how vicious these people are. And that's what America's turned into and imagine if these people get full control what they'll do to us.
[38:17.000 --> 38:25.000]  They'll turn all of America in what they've done in colleges anti free speech police state zones ruled by these demons.
[38:25.000 --> 38:31.000]  Here's a few minutes of Savannah Hernandez just a few nights ago in Austin Texas during an anti Trump rally.
[38:31.000 --> 38:34.000]  It wasn't really an anti war rally. Here it is.
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.000]  Can I ask you what you're doing today's rally ma'am?
[38:38.000 --> 38:44.000]  Do you all want to speak with me today? I'm asking you about Rose McGowan's tweet. No, not at all.
[38:44.000 --> 38:47.000]  OK, that's no problem. Ask them.
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  You're asking what question?
[38:49.000 --> 38:56.000]  I'm asking what people think about this tweet Rose McGowan. So I'm with action seven.
[38:56.000 --> 39:00.000]  Thank you. Would you like to comment on Rose McGowan's tweet?
[39:00.000 --> 39:03.000]  OK, well then I'm trying to talk to these gentlemen. Thank you.
[39:03.000 --> 39:10.000]  We're not hiding that we're info wars. If you have an info wars mic flag, they will physically.
[39:10.000 --> 39:17.000]  You've seen the videos attack women families. They go psychotic. It's like wearing a red Trump hat or even worse.
[39:17.000 --> 39:22.000]  So we're just going out there with a little media arm that Savannah has called action seven.
[39:22.000 --> 39:28.000]  It's her real thing. It's something she does, but she does that as like a pen name to an attacker.
[39:28.000 --> 39:32.000]  But then they go, oh, she's info wars like, oh, we caught you.
[39:32.000 --> 39:37.000]  But again, this is the insanity. And then after this woman and this man follow her around.
[39:37.000 --> 39:43.000]  Telling folks how to talk to her, then they won't talk to her and act like she's being mean to them. Here it is.
[39:43.000 --> 39:50.000]  Fine. OK, ma'am. No, this girl's from info wars. Ma'am, why does that? Why does that make us less value?
[39:50.000 --> 39:53.000]  She's also been to the war. Her father served in Vietnam. Did you know that?
[39:53.000 --> 39:56.000]  My grandfather served in Vietnam and I'm anti-worn as well.
[39:56.000 --> 39:59.000]  Calling communists is awesome.
[39:59.000 --> 40:03.000]  No, ma'am, like, let's have a conversation about this. We're both anti-war.
[40:03.000 --> 40:09.000]  If you're going to follow me around and discredit me in the media, so tell me why people that are from info wars is discrediting you.
[40:09.000 --> 40:13.000]  You're the one that's saying that people shouldn't talk to me because of who I work for.
[40:13.000 --> 40:18.000]  And I don't think that's fair. Why shouldn't they talk to me? I just like a response.
[40:18.000 --> 40:21.000]  OK, so you don't want to talk to me anymore? No, no, no.
[40:21.000 --> 40:26.000]  You know, you people have been following me around all night long and I just want a response from you now, ma'am.
[40:26.000 --> 40:29.000]  So this is your time to shine.
[40:29.000 --> 40:32.000]  Ladies, can I ask you why it's the importance of today's rally?
[40:32.000 --> 40:33.000]  Pause again.
[40:33.000 --> 40:40.000]  Back in five seconds, please. This is the perfect microcosm of how they get in her face. There's hours of this. There's a 20 minute report out.
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  They follow her around for hours.
[40:42.000 --> 40:49.000]  And then when she turns it around and wants to talk to them, oh, leave me alone and then guys come over like, hey, leave her alone, bully.
[40:49.000 --> 40:57.000]  Just like when the woman attacked her a few weeks ago, they called the police on her.
[40:57.000 --> 41:02.000]  These people are dangerous and they're authoritarian. Let's continue.
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.000]  We'll just follow them for the rest of the night.
[41:04.000 --> 41:08.000]  I mean, if people want to talk to us, they can if they don't, we're walking away.
[41:08.000 --> 41:11.000]  So yeah, if you guys don't want to, I'll leave. So it's up to you.
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.000]  Would you like to make three comments at all?
[41:13.000 --> 41:15.000]  Yeah, it's not good to see you.
[41:15.000 --> 41:19.000]  OK, thanks guys. Folks, can I ask you why today's rally was important to you?
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  They're going to follow us.
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  So are you just going to follow?
[41:23.000 --> 41:28.000]  By the way, even if they don't know who you are, they can't talk, they won't talk to you, almost all of them.
[41:28.000 --> 41:32.000]  And they're just hateful and they're weird. And I'm not going to play the rest of it.
[41:32.000 --> 41:36.000]  It gets worse there at the end, but it's it says Savannah Hernandez has her own section of band on video.
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  Just go there. Click the left hand link at the top.
[41:38.000 --> 41:41.000]  The menu rolls down. You can find the section. It's pretty amazing.
[41:41.000 --> 41:45.000]  But again, it's because they're such followers.
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  They don't just look weak or act weak.
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  They could be black. They could be white. They could be Hispanic.
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  They could be old. They could be young.
[41:51.000 --> 41:59.000]  They all look like a spider, sunk metaphysical, spiritual fangs into them and suck their essence out.
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  If you're a radio listener, you're missing this.
[42:01.000 --> 42:06.000]  But even if you're driving down the road in 18 Wheeler, keep an America going.
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.000]  You've all seen the videos online of the leftist rally.
[42:08.000 --> 42:11.000]  It's it's like a ugly duckling seminar.
[42:11.000 --> 42:14.000]  It's like a convention of ghouls.
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.000]  You've seen a little mermaid with Ursula and down at the bottom, all the souls she's captured.
[42:18.000 --> 42:22.000]  They all look shrunken and hunchbacked.
[42:22.000 --> 42:23.000]  That's that's how they are.
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.000]  And I'm not running down people that are old or hunchbacked.
[42:26.000 --> 42:27.000]  They can even be beautiful.
[42:27.000 --> 42:28.000]  You see their spirit shining through.
[42:28.000 --> 42:34.000]  I'm saying with the left, they're an ugly group of people and they're stupid and they act ugly.
[42:34.000 --> 42:40.000]  And they're anti free speech and they want to run our lives because they keep grasping for those that have a life force.
[42:40.000 --> 42:46.000]  And there's Savannah Hernandez politely wanting to get their perspective that all they have is the power to segregate
[42:46.000 --> 42:51.000]  and say we won't talk to you and then to act like they denied her human company.
[42:51.000 --> 42:55.000]  Because statistically, they are the most alone, isolated people.
[42:55.000 --> 42:58.000]  They want us to share their misery.
[42:58.000 --> 43:02.000]  The globalists know that I will never willingly give up.
[43:02.000 --> 43:05.000]  I've said it many times, I will never give in.
[43:05.000 --> 43:09.000]  I will never give up, but I could give out.
[43:09.000 --> 43:14.000]  And it's very, very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity.
[43:14.000 --> 43:18.000]  To see evil running rampant like this.
[43:18.000 --> 43:23.000]  And to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace.
[43:23.000 --> 43:27.000]  That most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech.
[43:27.000 --> 43:33.000]  And to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have
[43:33.000 --> 43:39.000]  by spreading the word about newswords.com, infowords.com and banned.video.
[43:39.000 --> 43:42.000]  And that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever.
[43:42.000 --> 43:46.000]  And then if you tell people, hey, the banned truth they don't want you to have
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.000]  is at infowords.com forward slash show and banned.video.
[43:50.000 --> 43:54.000]  So take heart folks, they've had to censor everybody to show everybody down
[43:54.000 --> 43:57.000]  because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square.
[43:57.000 --> 44:01.000]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[44:01.000 --> 44:03.000]  Introducing pollen block.
[44:03.000 --> 44:08.000]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[44:08.000 --> 44:15.000]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[44:15.000 --> 44:20.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[44:20.000 --> 44:24.000]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[44:24.000 --> 44:28.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later
[44:28.000 --> 44:32.000]  we now have the fruit of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet
[44:32.000 --> 44:35.000]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[44:35.000 --> 44:39.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[44:39.000 --> 44:44.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase
[44:44.000 --> 44:49.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[44:49.000 --> 44:52.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[44:52.000 --> 44:58.000]  Head to infowordslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[44:58.000 --> 45:02.000]  With the daily wear and tear of the environment on our skin,
[45:02.000 --> 45:05.000]  it's only natural that it starts to crack and take damage.
[45:05.000 --> 45:12.000]  Wind, heat, water and age are tell-tale signs that it's time to start taking care of your skin.
[45:12.000 --> 45:17.000]  With the Infowars Super Silver Cream, you can keep your skin feeling silky smooth
[45:17.000 --> 45:20.000]  and begin to heal the damages of the world around you.
[45:20.000 --> 45:26.000]  Created with ingredients like coconut oil, vitamin E and the incredible silver salt formula
[45:26.000 --> 45:29.000]  Infowars Silver Cream works triple duty
[45:29.000 --> 45:34.000]  supporting the beautifying and protecting of the skin in a fast, non-greasy formula
[45:34.000 --> 45:36.000]  small and easily stored.
[45:36.000 --> 45:40.000]  It can support dry and damaged skin to reduce fine lines and wrinkles
[45:40.000 --> 45:42.000]  while smoothing and softening calluses.
[45:42.000 --> 45:45.000]  With none of the harmful ingredients found in other formulas,
[45:45.000 --> 45:48.000]  you can be sure this silver cream is hard at work.
[45:48.000 --> 45:50.000]  Promoting the healing of your skin.
[45:50.000 --> 45:54.000]  Don't miss out on the new silver salt-powered Can't Miss formula.
[45:54.000 --> 45:59.000]  The Infowars Super Silver Cream today.
[45:59.000 --> 46:04.000]  Sunday was supposed to be the last day that we could offer store-wide free shipping
[46:04.000 --> 46:08.000]  double-patriot points. It was 75% off with our big year in sale
[46:08.000 --> 46:11.000]  because a lot of the products have already sold out.
[46:11.000 --> 46:13.000]  Most of the others are about to sell out.
[46:13.000 --> 46:17.000]  But quite frankly, I've been working on so many big stories that are breaking right now
[46:17.000 --> 46:19.000]  that I have not come up with new specials
[46:19.000 --> 46:22.000]  and we're already so close to selling out all these products
[46:22.000 --> 46:26.000]  that I'm just going to go ahead and keep the sale going for two more days
[46:26.000 --> 46:30.000]  and we're going to basically sell out of all of our major product lines.
[46:30.000 --> 46:33.000]  It'll take weeks, months for them all to come back in.
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.000]  Some come in in weeks, some come in in like three months.
[46:36.000 --> 46:38.000]  A lot of stuff's coming back in next week.
[46:38.000 --> 46:41.000]  So I've just decided because of the inventory issues and all the rest of it
[46:41.000 --> 46:44.000]  and because some of these we're selling at losses
[46:44.000 --> 46:46.000]  are making people buy a lot of other stuff and we are making a profit.
[46:46.000 --> 46:50.000]  So I'm going to just keep the sale going but only for 48 hours maximum
[46:50.000 --> 46:53.000]  and then we've got to stop at infowarstore.com
[46:53.000 --> 46:56.000]  the year-end now 2020 mega blowout sale
[46:56.000 --> 47:21.000]  infowarstore.com biggest sales we're ever going to have.
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  Oh, I want to face it.
[47:28.000 --> 47:31.000]  You can hear it.
[47:31.000 --> 47:33.000]  Yes, I hear that anxious.
[47:33.000 --> 47:35.000]  You're getting near it.
[47:35.000 --> 47:37.000]  Oh, I'm near it.
[47:37.000 --> 47:40.000]  You want to make it.
[47:40.000 --> 47:44.000]  Oh, because you can take it.
[47:44.000 --> 47:48.000]  You can take it.
[47:48.000 --> 47:50.000]  I've really been thinking about the symbol of info wars.
[47:50.000 --> 47:52.000]  We need a symbol.
[47:52.000 --> 47:58.000]  And I'm down to a wave or a volcano.
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.000]  Really been thinking.
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  We should have a vote on that.
[48:02.000 --> 48:06.000]  We're going to come out with a new logo soon.
[48:06.000 --> 48:10.000]  You belong on this planet.
[48:10.000 --> 48:11.000]  You're beautiful.
[48:11.000 --> 48:12.000]  You're made by God.
[48:12.000 --> 48:13.000]  We're going to do incredible things.
[48:13.000 --> 48:14.000]  You're not ugly.
[48:14.000 --> 48:15.000]  You're not bad.
[48:15.000 --> 48:19.000]  The only way you're ugly is if you turn yourself over to the globalist
[48:19.000 --> 48:22.000]  and end those that are hijacking our destiny.
[48:22.000 --> 48:25.000]  And then all the beauty will be taken from your mind.
[48:25.000 --> 48:29.000]  We're going to give it a great delusion on the light
[48:29.000 --> 48:36.000]  will disappear from your eyes.
[48:36.000 --> 48:41.000]  We are honored to be here on this live Friday broadcast.
[48:41.000 --> 48:44.000]  We're supposed to be off the air many years ago.
[48:44.000 --> 48:49.000]  They tried to set me up with violence or bombs, drugs.
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  They tried to set us up with child porn.
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  They've tried to destroy my life.
[48:53.000 --> 48:54.000]  They've tried to poison me.
[48:54.000 --> 48:56.000]  They've tried to sit in sex operatives.
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  They tried to pay people to lie.
[48:58.000 --> 48:59.000]  And thanks to your prayers.
[48:59.000 --> 49:04.000]  And I mean it, your prayers.
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  Thanks to you.
[49:06.000 --> 49:10.000]  God has protected info wars to this point.
[49:10.000 --> 49:11.000]  OK.
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  When we start the next hour,
[49:13.000 --> 49:17.000]  I'm going to do my best to just give the general breakdown
[49:17.000 --> 49:22.000]  of what the globalist are building and different facets of it
[49:22.000 --> 49:33.000]  and how we could defeat it with our action.
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  And then we have a special guest in studio
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  and then another guest joining us as well.
[49:37.000 --> 49:42.000]  That is an incredible journalist and a patriot for justice.
[49:42.000 --> 49:46.000]  He's been a political president in the Middle East.
[49:46.000 --> 49:51.000]  But let me just hit some of the news here.
[49:51.000 --> 49:56.000]  It happens a lot in the last century
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.000]  and in the first 20 years of this century
[49:59.000 --> 50:02.000]  that when you have countries that are surrounded
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  by other populist countries,
[50:04.000 --> 50:07.000]  you've got a lot of passenger commercial air traffic
[50:07.000 --> 50:12.000]  going in and out that there are hundreds
[50:12.000 --> 50:16.000]  if not thousands of missile batteries in places like Iran
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  and that people are going to think it's a missile
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  or it's a bomber or it's an attack
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  and you're going to shoot them down.
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  Did the transponders off
[50:24.000 --> 50:29.000]  or they could have had false signals on there?
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.000]  Clearly that airplane was shot down.
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  I said that day one, the videos have come out
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.000]  and there's videos of the missile parts on the ground
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  and they go, oh, look, it's a Russian missile.
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  Well, of course, the Russians are the second biggest seller
[50:41.000 --> 50:42.000]  of weapons in the world.
[50:42.000 --> 50:45.000]  They didn't blame the Russian people or the people of the U.S.
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  that it had been a U.S. missile.
[50:47.000 --> 50:50.000]  Whoever pointed it at that aircraft
[50:50.000 --> 50:55.000]  and hit the red button or pulled the trigger
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  and that's footage of the missiles
[50:57.000 --> 51:05.000]  that were fired at the U.S. base in Iraq.
[51:05.000 --> 51:08.000]  There's also footage of the missile,
[51:08.000 --> 51:12.000]  poor missile that was used there in,
[51:12.000 --> 51:15.000]  it appears, in Iran.
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  And the Iranians are saying,
[51:17.000 --> 51:20.000]  oh, show your proof, Trudeau,
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.000]  show your proof, Trump, whoever.
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  And I normally don't believe a word comes out
[51:24.000 --> 51:25.000]  of Justin Trudeau's mouth,
[51:25.000 --> 51:28.000]  but U.S. experts and many other experts believe
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  that it was shot down by a missile.
[51:30.000 --> 51:31.000]  Now, could you have a false flag
[51:31.000 --> 51:35.000]  if somebody go into Iran and then fire a missile?
[51:35.000 --> 51:36.000]  Absolutely.
[51:36.000 --> 51:41.000]  The missile was not that big.
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.000]  And routine flights have been suspended out of Iraq
[51:43.000 --> 51:46.000]  and out of Iran because it's a war zone.
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  That's why you don't fly into those places
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  and I'm sorry for the souls that were lost
[51:50.000 --> 51:54.000]  from all over the world that were flying out of Iran
[51:54.000 --> 51:58.000]  back into Ukraine.
[51:58.000 --> 52:00.000]  Ukraine airplanes shot down by mistake
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.000]  by Iran anti-aircraft missile Pentagon officials believe.
[52:02.000 --> 52:04.000]  And that's what I believe, day one,
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.000]  and not because I just believe what the Pentagon says.
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  There have been several planes before
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  shot down during the Iran-Iraq war,
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  one by the U.S., one by Iran.
[52:13.000 --> 52:16.000]  I mean, this is not the first rodeo here.
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.000]  So I just, I know the listeners know this,
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  but if a war is about to start or has started,
[52:20.000 --> 52:22.000]  you don't want to fly into one of those countries
[52:22.000 --> 52:25.000]  to give, it's a war between big powers
[52:25.000 --> 52:28.000]  because planes are getting shot down.
[52:28.000 --> 52:31.000]  But the fact that Tehran,
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  we have that video we can roll,
[52:33.000 --> 52:36.000]  Iran uses bulldozers to clear debris
[52:36.000 --> 52:39.000]  from plane crash site while accusing U.S. of big lie.
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  They shot it down and they're not letting
[52:41.000 --> 52:43.000]  foreign inspectors in to look at it.
[52:43.000 --> 52:47.000]  So that looks pretty suspicious to me.
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  The fact that that's going on.
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  Just like 9-11, they wouldn't let anybody look at the wreckage,
[52:51.000 --> 52:54.000]  wouldn't let foreign investigators in,
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  and there was so much evidence of bombs
[52:56.000 --> 52:58.000]  in Tower 7, Tower 1 and 2.
[52:58.000 --> 53:00.000]  That doesn't mean there isn't radical Islamic terror.
[53:00.000 --> 53:02.000]  It doesn't mean there wasn't something going on with Saudi Arabia.
[53:02.000 --> 53:05.000]  But obviously, there was a big stand-down going on,
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  and that's come out in Congress.
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  But we can't see the wreckage because it was taken off
[53:09.000 --> 53:12.000]  under guard and shipped to China.
[53:12.000 --> 53:17.000]  Well, the Iranians just did it again.
[53:17.000 --> 53:20.000]  And they're, again, driving around with the bulldozers,
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  getting rid of it.
[53:22.000 --> 53:25.000]  So shifting yours out of that now.
[53:25.000 --> 53:29.000]  Trump says pathetic Democrats would have leaked
[53:29.000 --> 53:33.000]  Soleimani strike plans to the fake news.
[53:33.000 --> 53:36.000]  We're going to play that clip in a moment.
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  Again, the video shows Ukrainian passenger plane
[53:38.000 --> 53:39.000]  being hit by a missile.
[53:39.000 --> 53:40.000]  We just showed that.
[53:40.000 --> 53:43.000]  Pathological, psychological warfare.
[53:43.000 --> 53:47.000]  Iran declares Canada and others to show intelligence
[53:47.000 --> 53:50.000]  they used to accuse Iran of downing Ukrainian jet.
[53:50.000 --> 53:54.000]  Well, I mean, witnesses said they saw a missile fire up,
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.000]  and then the plane blew up in air and then crashed on fire
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  before it hit the ground.
[53:58.000 --> 54:01.000]  So that would generally mean not having a malfunction
[54:01.000 --> 54:02.000]  and then crashing.
[54:02.000 --> 54:06.000]  It means being blown up and then crashing because of that.
[54:06.000 --> 54:08.000]  And in another clip I want to get to here in a moment
[54:08.000 --> 54:11.000]  is Fox News host.
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.000]  We're against the ground war with Iran.
[54:13.000 --> 54:14.000]  Trump listened.
[54:14.000 --> 54:17.000]  And of course BuzzFeed and others are upset that it wasn't
[54:17.000 --> 54:20.000]  a bigger war, I guess, because they're the big warlords now.
[54:20.000 --> 54:24.000]  But Tucker Carlson does have the president's ear.
[54:24.000 --> 54:27.000]  I can tell you that from folks I know that are close to the president.
[54:27.000 --> 54:30.000]  And I mean, I am friends with Tucker Carlson.
[54:30.000 --> 54:31.000]  I'm not going to get into that.
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.000]  We do talk, so I don't want to get into too much trouble.
[54:33.000 --> 54:37.000]  But Tucker really has the president's ear, and they talk a lot.
[54:37.000 --> 54:41.000]  And it's a really good thing that Tucker does that.
[54:41.000 --> 54:45.000]  The left particularly wants him removed at Fox.
[54:45.000 --> 54:46.000]  I don't have that from Tucker.
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.000]  I have people that have been at the meetings and seen it.
[54:48.000 --> 54:51.000]  That's why Tucker broadcasts mainly from Maine and stays away.
[54:51.000 --> 54:55.000]  Antifa comes to his house because he's a libertarian.
[54:55.000 --> 54:56.000]  He's popular.
[54:56.000 --> 54:59.000]  The left that isn't completely evil.
[54:59.000 --> 55:02.000]  Liberals out there listen to Carlson.
[55:02.000 --> 55:03.000]  That's why they want him off.
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  And thank God he's there.
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  And so there is validity to this story.
[55:07.000 --> 55:11.000]  I can tell you that he talks to Trump and says, don't listen to the neocons.
[55:11.000 --> 55:12.000]  They're going to set you up.
[55:12.000 --> 55:13.000]  They lied before.
[55:13.000 --> 55:14.000]  Sure, Iran's corrupt.
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  Sure, their leadership's bad.
[55:16.000 --> 55:19.000]  But you don't want to get suckered into this.
[55:19.000 --> 55:20.000]  The people don't want it.
[55:20.000 --> 55:23.000]  And he is that little angel on Trump's shoulder.
[55:23.000 --> 55:33.000]  When the devils like those that are betraying him bolted and others tell him opposite.
[55:33.000 --> 55:38.000]  Okay, we're going to get to that Trump clip here in a few minutes.
[55:38.000 --> 55:41.000]  First thing I want to say is this.
[55:41.000 --> 55:46.000]  I'm about a week overdue getting rid of the big year end mega special.
[55:46.000 --> 55:53.000]  And we held it way over and sold out of a bunch of things instead of getting to almost sell out and then sell at full price until the others come in.
[55:53.000 --> 55:54.000]  But that that's your gain.
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  It's great products and I'm sure it'll turn out for the best.
[55:56.000 --> 56:01.000]  I've just been so focused on news with all the war stuff and a lot of the stuff behind the scenes.
[56:01.000 --> 56:05.000]  But we're going to have a new sale today.
[56:05.000 --> 56:10.000]  I'm just going to call it a new sale because everything's not going to be on sale anymore because a lot of it's sold out.
[56:10.000 --> 56:11.000]  A lot of it's about to sell out.
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  But there's going to be some items that I'm going to leave up.
[56:13.000 --> 56:16.000]  I've decided until they do sell out.
[56:16.000 --> 56:26.000]  And that's the new whitening toothpaste that's got the nano silver that's patented and it's got the very highest quality above sea coral calcium to rememilarize your teeth.
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  It's amazing.
[56:28.000 --> 56:32.000]  I'm going to leave that at 50% off but only for a few more days.
[56:32.000 --> 56:36.000]  Super silver wound gel is about to sell out.
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.000]  I'm going to leave that up for a couple more days and then we'll let it go back to full price.
[56:40.000 --> 56:53.000]  I'm going to have to end the colloidal silver deal that we've got going for 995 the same stuff under another label sold for $25 usually on sale for $18 or so at Whole Foods.
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  We normally sell for about 19 to $15.
[56:55.000 --> 56:58.000]  This is a really good deal and is almost a loss leader at that price.
[56:58.000 --> 57:01.000]  It's the highest quality big old bottle, the colloidal silver.
[57:01.000 --> 57:02.000]  We private label it.
[57:02.000 --> 57:06.000]  Call it silver bullet but it's the top silver in the country.
[57:06.000 --> 57:07.000]  We private label silver bullet.
[57:07.000 --> 57:08.000]  That's 995.
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  That's about to end.
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  Biotrystallinium 60% off.
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  Survival shield X3 60% off.
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  Ultra 12 60% off.
[57:16.000 --> 57:17.000]  Rainforest plus 60% off.
[57:17.000 --> 57:19.000]  Eight pack power stack that sells about things.
[57:19.000 --> 57:21.000]  We've sold a lot of that.
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  That's at cost 75% off.
[57:23.000 --> 57:24.000]  It's amazing.
[57:24.000 --> 57:28.000]  Real red pill, real red pill plus 60% off the free bottle of Biotrystallinium.
[57:28.000 --> 57:29.000]  That will end by Monday.
[57:29.000 --> 57:30.000]  It has to.
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  Okay, because these things are selling out.
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  Vazo beats 50% off.
[57:36.000 --> 57:40.000]  So these are the things that are still up for sale in the end of year mega sale.
[57:40.000 --> 57:45.000]  And your funding runs this operation.
[57:45.000 --> 57:55.000]  So thank you for checking it out.
[58:15.000 --> 58:20.000]  ANd they've sold their soul to the dark side and they do what they do because
[58:20.000 --> 58:23.000]  they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and
[58:23.000 --> 58:26.000]  dominate and destroy the innocent.
[58:26.000 --> 58:27.000]  It is up to us who were awake.
[58:27.000 --> 58:32.000]  Not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheep dogs to stand firm and resist
[58:32.000 --> 58:34.000]  these wicked tyrants.
[58:34.000 --> 58:37.000]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[58:37.000 --> 58:40.000]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[58:40.000 --> 58:44.000]  They fear the fact that we love God.
[58:44.000 --> 58:47.500]  All we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[58:49.760 --> 58:53.320]  I spend a lot of time reminding the info wars
[58:53.320 --> 58:55.000]  of family of listeners and viewers
[58:56.040 --> 58:58.480]  that without you, we won't be on the air.
[58:58.480 --> 59:00.480]  And I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[59:00.480 --> 59:02.480]  But I really think you should thank yourself
[59:02.480 --> 59:05.240]  for keeping us on the air and really changing the world
[59:05.240 --> 59:06.720]  for the better and raising the alarm
[59:06.720 --> 59:07.840]  as modern ball reviewers.
[59:07.840 --> 59:10.160]  But something I should spend more time on
[59:10.160 --> 59:13.760]  is just reminding you that these products
[59:13.760 --> 59:15.320]  are really amazing.
[59:15.320 --> 59:16.720]  You've got that pledge from me,
[59:16.720 --> 59:18.480]  but you've seen the third-party test out there,
[59:18.480 --> 59:20.560]  the air filtration, the water filtration.
[59:20.560 --> 59:22.920]  The supplements are all the very best
[59:22.920 --> 59:24.040]  you're gonna find out there.
[59:24.040 --> 59:27.360]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else
[59:27.360 --> 59:30.200]  that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[59:30.200 --> 59:34.040]  So it's not a burden to support info wars.
[59:34.040 --> 59:38.840]  It really is something that is good for everybody
[59:38.840 --> 59:40.800]  that stands for justice and freedom
[59:40.800 --> 59:43.080]  and makes your life and your family's life
[59:43.080 --> 59:44.760]  and your children's life so much better.
[59:44.760 --> 59:47.680]  So visit infowarstore.com today.
[59:51.320 --> 59:54.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:54.400 --> 1:00:20.800]  Okay, I'm going to attempt to summon my intellect
[1:00:20.800 --> 1:00:27.960]  and try to break down the establishment's attempt
[1:00:27.960 --> 1:00:31.960]  to construct an artificial environment for humans
[1:00:31.960 --> 1:00:34.320]  to not just take control of our evolution,
[1:00:34.320 --> 1:00:40.240]  but to end the species as it exists.
[1:00:40.240 --> 1:00:41.920]  It's beyond any science fiction movie.
[1:00:41.920 --> 1:00:45.120]  You can imagine beyond any science horror you could ever read.
[1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:48.760]  It's beyond H.P. Lovecraft's color out of space.
[1:00:48.760 --> 1:00:53.680]  And I'm gonna do my best breaking it down
[1:00:53.680 --> 1:00:55.520]  in the next two seconds before Norm Patis comes in
[1:00:55.520 --> 1:00:59.440]  to studio with us.
[1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:01.560]  And then obviously there's all the other incredible news.
[1:01:01.560 --> 1:01:03.640]  We predicted they'd kill Epstein in jail
[1:01:03.640 --> 1:01:04.800]  or they'd say he died.
[1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:07.680]  We predicted that all the cameras would be malfunctioned
[1:01:07.680 --> 1:01:10.440]  and they did in two different events.
[1:01:10.440 --> 1:01:12.000]  And we even said that they would then go,
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:12.840]  oh, maybe we found it.
[1:01:12.840 --> 1:01:14.920]  Maybe we didn't and then finally say it's just erased.
[1:01:14.920 --> 1:01:17.800]  Well, they did that last night.
[1:01:17.800 --> 1:01:20.160]  These people are very predictable
[1:01:20.160 --> 1:01:23.400]  and it's only our childlike following what they say
[1:01:23.400 --> 1:01:25.320]  that's gotten us in trouble.
[1:01:25.320 --> 1:01:26.760]  Most people aren't bad and corrupt.
[1:01:26.760 --> 1:01:27.880]  Most people in government aren't bad,
[1:01:27.880 --> 1:01:30.760]  but the corrupt people in history have periods
[1:01:30.760 --> 1:01:34.880]  where they get control and then you have reins of terror.
[1:01:34.880 --> 1:01:36.200]  Well, we can bypass all that
[1:01:36.200 --> 1:01:37.600]  if we just have a big awakening
[1:01:37.600 --> 1:01:40.080]  and if people that work for Google and the system
[1:01:40.080 --> 1:01:43.760]  don't just gleefully go along with all the censorship
[1:01:43.760 --> 1:01:45.600]  and believe you're part of some ruling class
[1:01:45.600 --> 1:01:47.400]  and you're doing it for the betterment of society
[1:01:47.400 --> 1:01:48.760]  and I'm the bad guy.
[1:01:50.200 --> 1:01:52.160]  And that everybody that opposes you are the bad guys
[1:01:52.160 --> 1:01:54.000]  because that's just not true.
[1:01:55.200 --> 1:01:57.760]  You work for the bad guys if you're part of the establishment
[1:01:57.760 --> 1:02:00.520]  and you're aiding them in what they're doing.
[1:02:00.520 --> 1:02:02.280]  Now, I wanna play this special report
[1:02:02.280 --> 1:02:04.640]  because it's so important to know just how serious
[1:02:04.640 --> 1:02:06.680]  the globalist are and how they wanna start a civil war.
[1:02:06.680 --> 1:02:07.520]  Here it is.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:16.960]  of the United States for an outright ban
[1:02:16.960 --> 1:02:19.320]  picking up every one of them,
[1:02:19.320 --> 1:02:22.160]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:23.080]  I would have done it.
[1:02:23.080 --> 1:02:26.120]  When they give us that inch, that bump stock ban,
[1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:27.320]  we will take a mile.
[1:02:27.320 --> 1:02:28.800]  You've heard people say,
[1:02:28.800 --> 1:02:31.520]  you'll have to pry my guns for my cold ban.
[1:02:33.520 --> 1:02:34.360]  Okay.
[1:02:36.600 --> 1:02:39.440]  We have introduced an assault weapons ban.
[1:02:39.440 --> 1:02:43.200]  I'm talking about a ban on assault rifles.
[1:02:43.200 --> 1:02:45.200]  If you listen real close,
[1:02:45.200 --> 1:02:47.360]  you can hear the people in power shaking.
[1:02:47.360 --> 1:02:50.640]  It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday
[1:02:50.640 --> 1:02:52.040]  and then only do it every Monday.
[1:02:52.040 --> 1:02:54.280]  We need to do this every day of the week
[1:02:54.280 --> 1:02:56.880]  and just really brainwash people into thinking
[1:02:56.880 --> 1:02:58.960]  about guns in a vastly different way.
[1:02:58.960 --> 1:03:01.040]  Enough, enough, enough.
[1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:04.080]  We say no more.
[1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:06.480]  I'm the guy that originally wrote the assault weapons ban
[1:03:06.480 --> 1:03:08.320]  that became law.
[1:03:08.320 --> 1:03:10.560]  A gentleman just walked up to me in his picture line.
[1:03:10.560 --> 1:03:13.760]  He says, I have an AR-15 and I will turn this in
[1:03:13.760 --> 1:03:16.120]  if it means saving the lives of our kids.
[1:03:16.120 --> 1:03:19.800]  Hell yes, we're gonna take your AR-15, your AK-47.
[1:03:19.800 --> 1:03:21.160]  We're not gonna allow it to be used
[1:03:21.160 --> 1:03:24.000]  against our fellow Americans anymore.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:27.200]  Do you think Trump is responsible for what happened?
[1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:29.800]  I said, well look, I mean, obviously he didn't pull
[1:03:29.800 --> 1:03:32.120]  the trigger, but he's certainly been tweeting
[1:03:32.120 --> 1:03:33.680]  out the ammunition.
[1:03:33.680 --> 1:03:36.520]  I'm incredibly saddened and it's very hard
[1:03:36.520 --> 1:03:37.720]  to think about this.
[1:03:37.720 --> 1:03:44.040]  I'm tired of hearing people all they have
[1:03:44.040 --> 1:03:46.440]  to offer is thoughts and prayers.
[1:03:46.440 --> 1:03:50.480]  In my faith, people say faith without works is dead.
[1:03:50.480 --> 1:03:53.040]  So we will find a way, but the reason we have a problem
[1:03:53.040 --> 1:03:55.720]  right now is we've let the corporate gun lobby
[1:03:55.720 --> 1:03:57.200]  frame this debate.
[1:03:57.200 --> 1:04:00.560]  It is time that we have bold actions and a bold agenda.
[1:04:00.560 --> 1:04:03.640]  Over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault
[1:04:03.640 --> 1:04:06.960]  weapons off the street, period, and we have to get buybacks
[1:04:06.960 --> 1:04:08.560]  and get them out of their basements.
[1:04:08.560 --> 1:04:12.040]  Everyone up here favors an assault weapon ban.
[1:04:12.040 --> 1:04:15.840]  Everyone up here favors magazine limitations,
[1:04:15.840 --> 1:04:18.000]  which by the way would have made a huge difference.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:19.920]  We can ban the weapons of war.
[1:04:19.920 --> 1:04:22.080]  It's about ending the sales of assault weapons
[1:04:22.080 --> 1:04:23.280]  into our communities.
[1:04:23.280 --> 1:04:25.400]  Those weapons of war were designed to kill people
[1:04:25.400 --> 1:04:27.920]  as effectively and as efficiently as possible.
[1:04:27.920 --> 1:04:29.320]  They should belong on the battlefield
[1:04:29.320 --> 1:04:30.800]  and not in our communities.
[1:04:30.800 --> 1:04:32.480]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners
[1:04:32.480 --> 1:04:35.560]  would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers,
[1:04:35.560 --> 1:04:38.840]  not in the hands of criminals.
[1:04:38.840 --> 1:04:42.280]  By the way, you can't own the following weapons, period.
[1:04:42.280 --> 1:04:43.960]  They cannot be sold anymore.
[1:04:43.960 --> 1:04:45.840]  Well, like if you're going to take people's guns away,
[1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:49.200]  wait till you get elected, then take the guns away.
[1:04:49.200 --> 1:04:50.600]  Don't tell them ahead of time.
[1:04:50.600 --> 1:04:53.320]  Which by the way, that's what people like me
[1:04:53.320 --> 1:04:54.280]  think you're going to do.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:04:59.680]  I keep my eye on the news all the time,
[1:04:59.680 --> 1:05:04.000]  but I miss the fact that in late 2019, just about two
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:12.800]  weeks ago, the CDC and the FDA approved live Ebola vaccine
[1:05:12.800 --> 1:05:14.800]  to be given inside the United States.
[1:05:14.800 --> 1:05:17.200]  And it is an experimental vaccine.
[1:05:17.200 --> 1:05:19.160]  It is live.
[1:05:19.160 --> 1:05:21.200]  It's not even attenuated.
[1:05:21.200 --> 1:05:23.320]  They've just genetically modified it,
[1:05:23.320 --> 1:05:25.520]  so it's supposedly not lethal.
[1:05:25.520 --> 1:05:28.840]  Same stuff they did with the Gardasil vaccine that's
[1:05:28.840 --> 1:05:31.240]  admittedly killed and made so many.
[1:05:31.240 --> 1:05:33.440]  This is just crazy.
[1:05:33.440 --> 1:05:36.000]  And the Congos had the biggest outbreaks of Ebola ever
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:38.760]  since they started giving the vaccine there
[1:05:38.760 --> 1:05:40.040]  in the last few years.
[1:05:40.040 --> 1:05:42.120]  Oh, and of course, opened the borders up here
[1:05:42.120 --> 1:05:45.320]  and letting people in unvetted the Democrats
[1:05:45.320 --> 1:05:47.040]  distributed across the country.
[1:05:47.040 --> 1:05:50.480]  You cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity.
[1:05:50.480 --> 1:05:54.040]  And it is an attempted Ebola assault on America.
[1:05:54.040 --> 1:05:55.360]  This is the New World Order.
[1:05:55.360 --> 1:06:11.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic,
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:12.280]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:16.280 --> 1:06:20.600]  How many times must I tell you, baby?
[1:06:20.600 --> 1:06:24.880]  How many bridges I've got to cross?
[1:06:24.880 --> 1:06:27.880]  How many times must I explain myself?
[1:06:27.880 --> 1:06:30.240]  We can look at those headlines.
[1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:33.960]  Democrats unanimously agree at the highest levels
[1:06:33.960 --> 1:06:38.000]  for a national gun confiscation plan.
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:40.600]  It's just incredible.
[1:06:40.600 --> 1:06:43.480]  It almost makes me speechless.
[1:06:43.480 --> 1:06:45.960]  And then they're openly saying pedophilia is a good thing.
[1:06:45.960 --> 1:06:47.480]  And I've got articles right here where
[1:06:47.480 --> 1:06:54.000]  they're trying to ban single-family homes.
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:56.520]  All of it is right there.
[1:06:56.520 --> 1:06:59.480]  Hey, guys, will you bring me that article in about the ban
[1:06:59.480 --> 1:07:01.760]  in the single homes?
[1:07:01.760 --> 1:07:05.040]  Because I wanted that yesterday and I wanted it today.
[1:07:05.040 --> 1:07:14.880]  Maybe it's here, but I don't have it.
[1:07:14.880 --> 1:07:16.800]  I'm going to go to rebroadcast for a while.
[1:07:16.800 --> 1:07:22.200]  And when I get back, I'm going to lay out
[1:07:22.200 --> 1:07:25.000]  the technocracy and what we're dealing with
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:27.600]  and how we can stop it.
[1:07:27.600 --> 1:07:30.640]  And that's what that comes down to.
[1:07:30.640 --> 1:07:37.040]  But I'm going to codify all this and really put it together
[1:07:37.040 --> 1:07:42.360]  for you and then lay it all out for you
[1:07:42.360 --> 1:07:46.960]  because this stuff all ties together.
[1:07:46.960 --> 1:07:48.680]  And it's all part of a larger agenda.
[1:07:48.680 --> 1:07:51.400]  And when you know what the agenda is,
[1:07:51.400 --> 1:07:54.840]  then we can stop it.
[1:07:54.840 --> 1:07:56.280]  Norm Pattis, constitutional lawyer,
[1:07:56.280 --> 1:07:58.960]  criminal lawyer, you've seen all of the national news continually.
[1:07:58.960 --> 1:08:00.200]  He's going to be in studio with us
[1:08:00.200 --> 1:08:03.280]  to talk about the waterfront coming up as well.
[1:08:07.160 --> 1:08:13.080]  And then we have another special guest joining us
[1:08:13.080 --> 1:08:15.440]  in the third hour.
[1:08:15.440 --> 1:08:20.480]  Right now, I'd like to air clip one if we may
[1:08:20.480 --> 1:08:24.520]  because this goes to the heart of everything
[1:08:24.520 --> 1:08:26.520]  we're dealing with, everything we're
[1:08:26.520 --> 1:08:30.320]  facing as a society and as a culture.
[1:08:30.320 --> 1:08:32.320]  And then I'll get to the technocracy.
[1:08:32.320 --> 1:08:33.560]  It's not the cruise fault.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:37.080]  We were coming in the break.
[1:08:37.080 --> 1:08:38.920]  I was loaded for bear.
[1:08:38.920 --> 1:08:40.440]  I don't write notes of these type of things.
[1:08:40.440 --> 1:08:43.680]  I just I like loaded into my conscious mind.
[1:08:43.680 --> 1:08:46.160]  And then I've got a trajectory to go on.
[1:08:46.160 --> 1:08:48.200]  Or I'll get caught in little eddy pools.
[1:08:48.200 --> 1:08:51.320]  And I see the headline about the National Gun
[1:08:51.320 --> 1:08:53.800]  Confiscation Plan up at the start of the segment.
[1:08:53.800 --> 1:08:55.200]  And then I need that article.
[1:08:55.200 --> 1:08:57.520]  It's like there's some reason this article,
[1:08:57.520 --> 1:08:58.880]  I'm unable to get it.
[1:08:58.880 --> 1:09:01.440]  It was on infowars.com yesterday.
[1:09:01.440 --> 1:09:03.840]  And I needed that for the presentation.
[1:09:03.840 --> 1:09:05.920]  So I'm going to go get it.
[1:09:05.920 --> 1:09:07.880]  And then I'm going to be back as best I can.
[1:09:07.880 --> 1:09:12.320]  But I'm not covering this Joe Rogan thing
[1:09:12.320 --> 1:09:15.480]  because I'm in the middle of it.
[1:09:15.480 --> 1:09:17.360]  If you understand this with Joe Rogan,
[1:09:17.360 --> 1:09:19.560]  then you understand it all because this
[1:09:19.560 --> 1:09:22.960]  is what the system is doing.
[1:09:22.960 --> 1:09:24.800]  And if they're doing it to Joe Rogan,
[1:09:24.800 --> 1:09:25.840]  they're going to do it to you.
[1:09:25.840 --> 1:09:27.080]  They're doing it to everybody.
[1:09:27.080 --> 1:09:29.120]  But whatever is the knowledge of the crowd,
[1:09:29.120 --> 1:09:31.960]  whatever the people want is what the system's
[1:09:31.960 --> 1:09:34.200]  trying to block, which, again, at a fundamental level
[1:09:34.200 --> 1:09:37.800]  shows how anti-human this entire agenda is.
[1:09:37.800 --> 1:09:40.280]  So here's the report I filed last night.
[1:09:40.280 --> 1:09:45.280]  Back in 2019, Sundar Pachai, the CEO of Google,
[1:09:45.280 --> 1:09:47.920]  told Congress while I was in the committee room
[1:09:47.920 --> 1:09:51.120]  that they've never gamed or rigged
[1:09:51.120 --> 1:09:54.960]  any search result in the history of Google.
[1:09:54.960 --> 1:09:56.880]  That's like saying the sun has never
[1:09:56.880 --> 1:10:00.920]  set or never risen over the planet Earth.
[1:10:00.920 --> 1:10:03.720]  It was a spectacular bald-faced lie
[1:10:03.720 --> 1:10:06.600]  and exercise in complete deception.
[1:10:06.600 --> 1:10:09.840]  And now here we are, a year later.
[1:10:09.840 --> 1:10:11.960]  And the number one podcast of 2019
[1:10:11.960 --> 1:10:14.520]  was my appearance on the Joe Rogan experience.
[1:10:14.520 --> 1:10:18.040]  In fact, it's the number one long-form podcast
[1:10:18.040 --> 1:10:20.400]  in YouTube history.
[1:10:20.400 --> 1:10:22.480]  And as soon as all these news articles
[1:10:22.480 --> 1:10:25.560]  were written about it being the number one podcast,
[1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:27.640]  what did Google do?
[1:10:27.640 --> 1:10:31.920]  They delisted it out of the Joe Rogan directory
[1:10:31.920 --> 1:10:34.480]  of most viewed.
[1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:37.480]  Imagine if somebody won a race car race and they just said,
[1:10:37.480 --> 1:10:39.920]  well, we're going to take them out of the pole position.
[1:10:39.920 --> 1:10:42.320]  We're going to take them out of the checkered flag.
[1:10:42.320 --> 1:10:44.360]  We're going to say that they never won.
[1:10:44.360 --> 1:10:46.640]  That's beyond what the Soviets would do
[1:10:46.640 --> 1:10:49.200]  when they would kill somebody who was in the Soviet
[1:10:49.200 --> 1:10:52.920]  government of Lenin or Stalin.
[1:10:52.920 --> 1:10:55.200]  And then they would airbrush their photo
[1:10:55.200 --> 1:10:58.640]  out of subsequent publications and newspapers.
[1:10:58.640 --> 1:11:01.040]  This is being done in real time by AI.
[1:11:01.040 --> 1:11:02.640]  It's being done across the board.
[1:11:02.640 --> 1:11:07.400]  And it's gaming elections, like Professor Robert Epstein
[1:11:07.400 --> 1:11:08.920]  has exposed.
[1:11:08.920 --> 1:11:13.080]  And simply by omitting results, Google,
[1:11:13.080 --> 1:11:17.560]  who is responsible now for over 90% of all internet queries
[1:11:17.560 --> 1:11:21.320]  for searches, can completely distort reality
[1:11:21.320 --> 1:11:24.560]  and manipulate minds.
[1:11:24.560 --> 1:11:29.360]  And when you look at what Google and its subdivision
[1:11:29.360 --> 1:11:32.840]  YouTube are doing, is they're particularly suppressing
[1:11:32.840 --> 1:11:36.280]  any information about Epstein and the Clintons
[1:11:36.280 --> 1:11:39.680]  and the sex trafficking and Dyncor
[1:11:39.680 --> 1:11:41.840]  and all of that information that's now coming out
[1:11:41.840 --> 1:11:45.040]  in the mainstream that we covered years ago.
[1:11:45.040 --> 1:11:48.720]  And so it is a badge of honor to be censored by these individuals.
[1:11:48.720 --> 1:11:53.080]  But the arrogance of corporate America to work in unison,
[1:11:53.080 --> 1:11:55.280]  it's not just Google doing an Apple when we have the number
[1:11:55.280 --> 1:11:57.480]  one news app two years ago, Bandus.
[1:11:57.480 --> 1:11:59.360]  Number one in news.
[1:11:59.360 --> 1:12:00.760]  And they said, oh, it's curation.
[1:12:00.760 --> 1:12:03.720]  The public can't have this information.
[1:12:03.720 --> 1:12:07.480]  And again, that's exactly what Professor Robert Epstein has
[1:12:07.480 --> 1:12:08.080]  exposed.
[1:12:08.080 --> 1:12:12.040]  And we're seeing the 2020 election be stolen, be
[1:12:12.040 --> 1:12:14.040]  gamed right in front of us.
[1:12:14.040 --> 1:12:18.360]  And it's one of Trump's greatest failures in not taking action.
[1:12:18.360 --> 1:12:20.240]  And so if Joe Rogan doesn't respond to this,
[1:12:20.240 --> 1:12:21.960]  if internet doesn't get upset about this,
[1:12:21.960 --> 1:12:24.600]  it's another test that we fail.
[1:12:24.600 --> 1:12:27.400]  And they won't just be delisting and shadow banning
[1:12:27.400 --> 1:12:28.440]  interviews.
[1:12:28.440 --> 1:12:31.280]  They'll be completely taking them down
[1:12:31.280 --> 1:12:33.720]  because they're popular.
[1:12:33.720 --> 1:12:36.040]  Because the people resonate with them
[1:12:36.040 --> 1:12:37.840]  and because they're awakening humanity.
[1:12:37.840 --> 1:12:42.160]  Not because they're lies or fake news.
[1:12:42.160 --> 1:12:45.200]  And now we see comedians roasting Holly
[1:12:45.200 --> 1:12:46.960]  with the Golden Globes and telling them,
[1:12:46.960 --> 1:12:48.800]  you're a bunch of perverts and pedophiles.
[1:12:48.800 --> 1:12:50.520]  And the comedians saying that, it's
[1:12:50.520 --> 1:12:55.120]  more views than the entire Golden Globes alone on YouTube.
[1:12:55.120 --> 1:12:57.640]  And so the establishment knows that truth
[1:12:57.640 --> 1:12:59.440]  and challenging the establishment is popular.
[1:12:59.440 --> 1:13:02.520]  That's why they're working so hard to suppress it.
[1:13:02.520 --> 1:13:05.120]  But that's why we've built Band-Aught Video.
[1:13:05.120 --> 1:13:06.720]  That's why we've built NewsWorst.com.
[1:13:06.720 --> 1:13:09.080]  That's why we've supported other sites out there.
[1:13:09.080 --> 1:13:12.400]  They're telling the truth that we have our own independent systems
[1:13:12.400 --> 1:13:15.880]  to challenge the censorship and the authoritarianism
[1:13:15.880 --> 1:13:17.720]  and the establishment narrative.
[1:13:17.720 --> 1:13:20.320]  But at the same time, they're working around the clock
[1:13:20.320 --> 1:13:22.680]  to actually shut us down and not even let us have access
[1:13:22.680 --> 1:13:25.560]  to the internet, not even let us have servers.
[1:13:25.560 --> 1:13:27.800]  Because obviously, that's going to be the next level.
[1:13:27.800 --> 1:13:30.320]  The tyranny is physically removing our existence off
[1:13:30.320 --> 1:13:34.200]  even the darker corners or more hidden areas of the internet.
[1:13:34.200 --> 1:13:36.040]  I know that Joe was under tremendous pressure
[1:13:36.040 --> 1:13:38.840]  not to have me on after my first podcast visit was one
[1:13:38.840 --> 1:13:41.280]  of the biggest he ever did.
[1:13:41.280 --> 1:13:44.280]  Where we exposed in 2017, Jeffrey Epstein,
[1:13:44.280 --> 1:13:46.200]  the pedophile rings.
[1:13:46.200 --> 1:13:50.280]  So Joe had a lot of courage in 2019 to have me on.
[1:13:50.280 --> 1:13:52.560]  But now more than ever, whether he likes it or not,
[1:13:52.560 --> 1:13:55.000]  he's been drafted into this conflict.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:57.320]  And if he chooses to take that commission
[1:13:57.320 --> 1:13:59.480]  and stand up as an officer for liberty and freedom
[1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:01.960]  and be a modern Paul Revere, Joe really
[1:14:01.960 --> 1:14:05.840]  could change the world more than he's even done already.
[1:14:05.840 --> 1:14:08.760]  But regardless of what decision Joe Rogan makes,
[1:14:08.760 --> 1:14:11.640]  it's up to all of us to make the right decision.
[1:14:11.640 --> 1:14:13.280]  I know I've been the right decision.
[1:14:13.280 --> 1:14:15.280]  I've bet on humanity.
[1:14:15.280 --> 1:14:20.040]  [?].
[1:14:20.040 --> 1:14:22.920]  So they are delisting it off of iTunes.
[1:14:22.920 --> 1:14:26.760]  They're delisting it off of Google.
[1:14:26.760 --> 1:14:28.320]  And they usually do that shadow ban
[1:14:28.320 --> 1:14:30.400]  before taking it down completely.
[1:14:30.400 --> 1:14:33.520]  Because they just can't have something be number one.
[1:14:33.520 --> 1:14:36.120]  40-something million views if you add up the different videos
[1:14:36.120 --> 1:14:38.320]  together just to that interview, just on YouTube.
[1:14:38.320 --> 1:14:45.120]  And then it's been number one in long form there on iTunes.
[1:14:45.120 --> 1:14:47.760]  And so imagine that.
[1:14:47.760 --> 1:14:49.400]  Oh, a book's the number one seller,
[1:14:49.400 --> 1:14:54.440]  so we won't let you buy it or read it.
[1:14:54.440 --> 1:14:55.400]  Well, that's a bookstore.
[1:14:55.400 --> 1:14:56.680]  It's a choice not to sell it, right?
[1:14:56.680 --> 1:14:59.400]  But see, this is Joe Rogan.
[1:14:59.400 --> 1:15:00.800]  This is someone with a guest on.
[1:15:00.800 --> 1:15:02.160]  This is something that happened.
[1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:03.480]  This is something that was popular.
[1:15:03.480 --> 1:15:05.160]  This is something that's number one.
[1:15:05.160 --> 1:15:07.760]  And they're saying, no, no, no, you can't have that.
[1:15:07.760 --> 1:15:08.880]  That's mind control.
[1:15:08.880 --> 1:15:10.960]  That's so dangerous on so many fronts.
[1:15:10.960 --> 1:15:12.000]  Oh, build your own YouTube.
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:12.480]  Well, we have.
[1:15:12.480 --> 1:15:15.360]  It's called Band-Aid video.
[1:15:15.360 --> 1:15:21.680]  We don't have $700 billion like Google.
[1:15:21.680 --> 1:15:23.440]  We don't even have $500,000 extra dollars.
[1:15:26.520 --> 1:15:31.400]  We don't have a trillion like Apple or Sly Factors in China.
[1:15:31.400 --> 1:15:35.320]  And I'm not gay and really skinny with bug eyes.
[1:15:35.320 --> 1:15:37.160]  So it's OK if Jim Cook owns and runs the worst
[1:15:37.160 --> 1:15:39.920]  Sly Factors on Earth because he's gay.
[1:15:39.920 --> 1:15:43.080]  So it's OK.
[1:15:43.080 --> 1:15:45.400]  All right, you can find the band interview
[1:15:45.400 --> 1:15:47.520]  at m4wars.com right now.
[1:15:47.520 --> 1:15:48.880]  And if they banned it off the internet,
[1:15:48.880 --> 1:15:50.680]  I'll post it at Band-Aid video unless Joe tells me
[1:15:50.680 --> 1:15:51.760]  he doesn't want me to.
[1:15:51.760 --> 1:15:52.320]  Stay with us.
[1:15:52.320 --> 1:16:02.320]  I'm going to break on the technocracy next.
[1:16:22.320 --> 1:16:25.680]  Family Survival to survivalistcamps.com.
[1:16:52.320 --> 1:16:55.800]  James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[1:16:55.800 --> 1:16:57.800]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[1:16:57.800 --> 1:16:59.720]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure,
[1:16:59.720 --> 1:17:01.520]  and high cholesterol levels may not
[1:17:01.520 --> 1:17:03.200]  be fully detected by you.
[1:17:03.200 --> 1:17:04.720]  But the symptoms are there.
[1:17:04.720 --> 1:17:07.400]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops,
[1:17:07.400 --> 1:17:09.680]  poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[1:17:09.680 --> 1:17:11.680]  are just a few of these that can alert you
[1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:13.080]  that something is wrong.
[1:17:13.080 --> 1:17:15.120]  Here, how heart and body extract is
[1:17:15.120 --> 1:17:17.440]  making a difference in thousands of people's
[1:17:17.440 --> 1:17:18.960]  lives across America.
[1:17:18.960 --> 1:17:20.800]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[1:17:20.800 --> 1:17:23.040]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[1:17:23.040 --> 1:17:25.480]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look,
[1:17:25.480 --> 1:17:27.440]  and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[1:17:27.440 --> 1:17:29.600]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:32.240]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent

[1:17:35.240 --> 1:17:37.520]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[1:17:57.680 --> 1:18:00.520]  Sunday was supposed to be the last day
[1:18:00.520 --> 1:18:02.200]  that we could offer a store ride for shipping,
[1:18:02.200 --> 1:18:03.160]  double-patriot points.
[1:18:03.160 --> 1:18:06.680]  It was 75% off with our big year in sale.
[1:18:06.680 --> 1:18:09.000]  Because a lot of the products have already sold out.
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:10.800]  Most of the others are about to sell out.
[1:18:10.800 --> 1:18:13.680]  But quite frankly, I've been working on so many big stories
[1:18:13.680 --> 1:18:15.840]  that are breaking right now that I have not
[1:18:15.840 --> 1:18:17.480]  come up with new specials.
[1:18:17.480 --> 1:18:19.160]  And we're already so close to selling out
[1:18:19.160 --> 1:18:21.920]  all these products that I'm just going to go ahead
[1:18:21.920 --> 1:18:24.080]  and keep the sale going for two more days.
[1:18:24.080 --> 1:18:25.880]  And we're going to basically sell out
[1:18:25.880 --> 1:18:27.960]  of all of our major product lines.
[1:18:27.960 --> 1:18:31.320]  It'll take weeks, months for them all to come back in.
[1:18:31.320 --> 1:18:33.800]  Some come in in weeks, some come in in like three months.
[1:18:33.800 --> 1:18:35.800]  A lot of stuff's coming back in next week.
[1:18:35.800 --> 1:18:38.240]  So I've just decided, because of the inventory issues
[1:18:38.240 --> 1:18:40.360]  and all the rest of it, and because some of these
[1:18:40.360 --> 1:18:42.240]  we're selling at losses, are making people
[1:18:42.240 --> 1:18:44.480]  buy a lot of other stuff, and we are making a profit.
[1:18:44.480 --> 1:18:46.080]  So I'm going to just keep the sale going,
[1:18:46.080 --> 1:18:48.200]  but only for 48 hours maximum.
[1:18:48.200 --> 1:18:49.520]  And then we've got to stop it.
[1:18:49.520 --> 1:18:54.240]  Infowarsstore.com, the year end, now 2020 mega blowout sale,
[1:18:54.240 --> 1:18:57.680]  Infowarsstore.com, biggest sales we're ever going to have.

[1:20:03.560 --> 1:20:10.560]  Welcome back. I am your host, Alex Jones,
[1:20:10.560 --> 1:20:13.560]  on this Friday, January 10th, 2020 edition.
[1:20:13.560 --> 1:20:16.560]  The future is here. It's time to say goodbye.
[1:20:16.560 --> 1:20:17.560]  Thank you.
[1:20:17.560 --> 1:20:18.560]  Thank you.
[1:20:18.560 --> 1:20:19.560]  Thank you.
[1:20:19.560 --> 1:20:20.560]  Thank you.
[1:20:20.560 --> 1:20:21.560]  Thank you.
[1:20:21.560 --> 1:20:22.560]  Thank you.
[1:20:22.560 --> 1:20:23.560]  Thank you.
[1:20:23.560 --> 1:20:24.560]  Thank you.
[1:20:24.560 --> 1:20:25.560]  Thank you.
[1:20:25.560 --> 1:20:26.560]  Thank you.
[1:20:26.560 --> 1:20:27.560]  Thank you.
[1:20:27.560 --> 1:20:28.560]  Thank you.
[1:20:28.560 --> 1:20:29.560]  Thank you.
[1:20:29.560 --> 1:20:30.560]  Thank you.
[1:20:30.560 --> 1:20:31.560]  Thank you.
[1:20:31.560 --> 1:20:33.560]  The future is here.
[1:20:33.560 --> 1:20:37.560]  It's just not evenly distributed at this point.
[1:20:37.560 --> 1:20:39.560]  That's what's happened.
[1:20:39.560 --> 1:20:41.560]  And...
[1:20:44.560 --> 1:20:48.560]  I really want to try to break down the technocracy.
[1:20:48.560 --> 1:20:52.560]  I really want to lay down what their in-game plan is
[1:20:52.560 --> 1:20:54.560]  and what we need to do to fight it.
[1:20:54.560 --> 1:20:56.560]  But I'm just not able to at this point.
[1:20:56.560 --> 1:20:58.560]  There's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes and things.
[1:20:58.560 --> 1:21:00.560]  Nobody's fault, I just can't do it.
[1:21:00.560 --> 1:21:15.680]  So, it's too important to, you know, like I said earlier, I really and truly want to
[1:21:15.680 --> 1:21:22.600]  do heavily produced reports and that go into the numbers and the facts and the statements
[1:21:22.600 --> 1:21:27.360]  and that carve out each area of the overall program to show how it's being integrated
[1:21:27.360 --> 1:21:37.120]  together and then show how the technocrats, the social engineers, the mad scientist
[1:21:37.120 --> 1:21:38.640]  are admitting they're doing it.
[1:21:38.640 --> 1:21:46.040]  See, you have to understand, it's not just I'm up here saying they're doing all this
[1:21:46.040 --> 1:21:50.120]  and then it's my opinion about why they're doing it or where it's taking us.
[1:21:50.120 --> 1:21:55.480]  It's all there, the geoengineering, the manipulation of the climate, the chemicals that are released
[1:21:55.480 --> 1:22:06.760]  on purpose to ravage life across the planet and they're slowly killing the planet while
[1:22:06.760 --> 1:22:11.000]  they're telling you that it's going to die and that it's your fault and that humanity
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:14.600]  has to die to save the planet.
[1:22:14.600 --> 1:22:21.720]  So, do you see how that logic and how that trick works?
[1:22:21.720 --> 1:22:27.840]  Humans are inherently bad, humans are the reason the planet's dying, we need a global
[1:22:27.840 --> 1:22:38.120]  government to protect the planet and then the engineers that are taking over the planet
[1:22:38.120 --> 1:22:45.040]  want to build a new planet where humans are extinct and that remnants of what were humans
[1:22:45.040 --> 1:22:52.160]  supposedly merged with silicon to make this new life form and then they themselves are
[1:22:52.160 --> 1:22:56.520]  systematically trying to heat the planet up with the terraforming.
[1:22:56.520 --> 1:23:00.320]  It's not geoengineering, geoengineering is when you geoengineer for what you already
[1:23:00.320 --> 1:23:04.840]  have and what you want and what your species wants.
[1:23:04.840 --> 1:23:10.600]  Teraforming is when you take something that's inhospitable to you and you change it to
[1:23:10.600 --> 1:23:20.840]  be hospitable and that's what's going on and we're being terraformed, we're being
[1:23:20.840 --> 1:23:31.040]  changed and it's not for the best and everything being established is being set up to be artificial.
[1:23:31.040 --> 1:23:36.920]  Now let's just take one little piece of the technology and that's the Internet.
[1:23:36.920 --> 1:23:43.120]  Developed in the 1960s as a plan to have every human monitored by central computer terminals
[1:23:43.120 --> 1:23:49.320]  and digital tablets that we would carry that would interface with those and track our every
[1:23:49.320 --> 1:23:57.720]  movement and then it would also track what we do to add input to control or stimuli the
[1:23:57.720 --> 1:24:05.440]  mass of the population in a giant human machine interface building the first artificially
[1:24:05.440 --> 1:24:14.720]  intelligent alien life form that is a symbiosis in the paperwork of humans and the machine
[1:24:14.720 --> 1:24:20.760]  interface by billions of humans interfacing into the nodes in real time with their eyes
[1:24:20.760 --> 1:24:26.880]  and ears and thoughts and ideas and hopes and dreams and data and input through AI through
[1:24:26.880 --> 1:24:31.400]  all these other systems through these filters back out through satellites and surveillance
[1:24:31.400 --> 1:24:40.760]  cameras and smart dust and drones and 5G and cell towers so that the AI can then absorb
[1:24:40.760 --> 1:24:51.640]  the human knowledge and then in the process make humans obsolete, stunted, stupid, alone
[1:24:51.640 --> 1:24:56.160]  and then they'll be offered to quote transition out of the hell that they're creating for
[1:24:56.160 --> 1:25:02.960]  us into the supposed digital Eden of the new false dimension silicon dimension they're
[1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:11.800]  creating taking us with them into that dimension and that's the simplest way to break that
[1:25:11.800 --> 1:25:17.080]  down and that's what they admit it was set up for you're always told it was set up defeat
[1:25:17.080 --> 1:25:21.360]  the Russians in a nuclear war so there's still be communications and no way to cut off communications
[1:25:21.360 --> 1:25:29.240]  that is not what it was set up for that's what the Pentagon was told it was being set
[1:25:29.240 --> 1:25:35.720]  up for just like the Pentagon's going over to Microsoft cloud oh we don't trust Jeff
[1:25:35.720 --> 1:25:41.240]  Bezos he's a big liberal which he is a leftist globalist tax exemptor that tells everybody
[1:25:41.240 --> 1:25:48.400]  else they need to have high taxes with him but Bill Gates of course is the only one trusted
[1:25:48.400 --> 1:25:53.320]  to have the Pentagon's all its secrets all its interfaces that the Pentagon won't control
[1:25:53.320 --> 1:25:58.960]  but that Microsoft will and the AI will because Bill Gates his dad ran the eugenics cold springs
[1:25:58.960 --> 1:26:05.400]  harbor program he ran Planned Parenthood for the Rockefellers he got IBM and the grants
[1:26:05.400 --> 1:26:15.080]  out of that to give Bill Gates his monopoly with Microsoft that family is trusted science
[1:26:15.080 --> 1:26:21.160]  officers of this group and I can talk for 10 hours about that alone and the eugenics
[1:26:21.160 --> 1:26:28.560]  and all the rest of it and IBM and Thomas Watson and the Nazis and and and the whole
[1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:33.320]  plan but IBM couldn't get around because of monopoly so they set up Microsoft and acted
[1:26:33.320 --> 1:26:38.440]  like oh we just gave Microsoft the software didn't know how important that would be and
[1:26:38.440 --> 1:26:46.560]  all this crap and then all these mid-level hippies and programmers and people think they're
[1:26:46.560 --> 1:26:53.680]  building one thing for global peace and all the rest of it and they're really building
[1:26:53.680 --> 1:27:04.480]  something completely different and at the higher levels of government they say oh it's
[1:27:04.480 --> 1:27:07.880]  a total surveillance grid the interfaces of all human activity it's going to create total
[1:27:07.880 --> 1:27:11.440]  peace on earth and we're going to know about all crime and all bad things we're going to
[1:27:11.440 --> 1:27:15.080]  be able to fix it all but you notice everything it's worse and worse and worse people have
[1:27:15.080 --> 1:27:19.400]  to work more and more and more people are dumber and more alone but oh we've got to
[1:27:19.400 --> 1:27:25.720]  build the giant total surveillance AI grid because if we don't the Chinese will or somebody
[1:27:25.720 --> 1:27:31.200]  else will we have to build it to be guardians of everything like Johnny Depp and his singularity
[1:27:31.200 --> 1:27:37.880]  movie transcendence where he becomes the AI and is a benevolent dust that enters the
[1:27:37.880 --> 1:27:44.040]  atmosphere well that's the actual admitted 30 year ago DARPA plan to have smart dust
[1:27:44.040 --> 1:27:51.720]  in everything so every grain of sand has an IP address but if you don't serve the globalist
[1:27:51.720 --> 1:27:55.880]  and whatever it is they want you to do to stay in the matrix because that's what they're
[1:27:55.880 --> 1:28:05.240]  dimensional matrix that swallows you up then they'll deactivate your web address and you'll
[1:28:05.240 --> 1:28:11.760]  be obsolete and everyone will run from you shunning you and you will effectively not
[1:28:11.760 --> 1:28:16.400]  able to take one step outside your front door as the Chinese government said last year about
[1:28:16.400 --> 1:28:20.000]  what they're building with Google and Apple and beta testing they're already being rolled
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:26.280]  out here as well oh let's make it about Alex Jones let's demonize him he's warning about
[1:28:26.280 --> 1:28:33.800]  it then let's have people not stand up for him and then we'll roll it out against everybody
[1:28:33.800 --> 1:28:37.640]  and that's part one of what I'm gonna be getting into and detailing and showing all the documentation
[1:28:37.640 --> 1:28:41.920]  about what they're doing how they sell it to the general public what the globalist are
[1:28:41.920 --> 1:28:48.880]  told us for and what it's really going to be because they're all of them deceived just
[1:28:48.880 --> 1:28:54.560]  like the one ring rings of power given out but only to enslave those that have them they're
[1:28:54.560 --> 1:29:01.160]  right back we can all agree these are troubled times right so do you know who's on your wireless

[1:30:00.760 --> 1:30:07.720]  hate info wars it's because we're awake we're alive we're passionate and we're not giving
[1:30:07.720 --> 1:30:13.600]  up that's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the new order's plans
[1:30:13.600 --> 1:30:18.480]  to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us that's
[1:30:18.480 --> 1:30:24.000]  what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags the globalists have literally
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:28.920]  sold their soul to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves because
[1:30:28.920 --> 1:30:34.600]  they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent it is
[1:30:34.600 --> 1:30:41.640]  up to us who are awake not the sheep and not the wolves but the sheep dogs to stand firm
[1:30:41.640 --> 1:30:47.920]  and resist these wicked tyrants they fear the fact that we are awake they fear the fact
[1:30:47.920 --> 1:30:54.160]  that we are alive they fear the fact that we love God and that's all we ever have to
[1:30:54.160 --> 1:30:59.600]  know is that God is in charge you want to break some globalist ribs you want to crush
[1:30:59.600 --> 1:31:04.320]  some skulls politically you want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually
[1:31:04.320 --> 1:31:10.240]  there's nowhere you can spend money there's nowhere you can place your bet in a fight
[1:31:10.240 --> 1:31:15.960]  where it's gonna have more power per dollar your bang for your buck fear gets you great
[1:31:15.960 --> 1:31:22.160]  products at great prices that literally fund the system where the spirit of resistance
[1:31:22.160 --> 1:31:26.800]  lives to drive it home to the enemy and so it's very simple if you don't want to be slaves
[1:31:26.800 --> 1:31:31.720]  and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy which God wants to see you see we have
[1:31:31.720 --> 1:31:37.440]  make the effort 110% God will finish the move and I know I need to stay in the fight in
[1:31:37.440 --> 1:31:41.760]  the attack attack attack I want to attack I want to go after the globalist and just
[1:31:41.760 --> 1:31:44.840]  believe me ladies and gentlemen that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family
[1:31:44.840 --> 1:31:48.800]  to fight for all of our futures together you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game I'm
[1:31:48.800 --> 1:31:53.040]  going to bust my ass with everything I got for us for myself and my family for your
[1:31:53.040 --> 1:32:01.280]  family because we're in this together infowarstore.com knock on wood I am not tempting fate but
[1:32:01.280 --> 1:32:07.000]  everybody around the office especially folks that have worked there a long time have noticed
[1:32:07.000 --> 1:32:12.040]  that I really don't ever get sick now again I might get sick tomorrow because I just made
[1:32:12.040 --> 1:32:16.400]  that statement I'm not tempting fate I'll say that again because I am superstitious
[1:32:16.400 --> 1:32:20.440]  when it comes down to that I'm very thankful to the good Lord for the constitution I've
[1:32:20.440 --> 1:32:27.800]  been given but up until about eight nine years ago when I started taking X2 and the products
[1:32:27.800 --> 1:32:33.320]  then forced life I still got sick every couple years and you know I still get sore throats
[1:32:33.320 --> 1:32:39.960]  from allergies and pollen and things like that but now that I religiously take the products
[1:32:39.960 --> 1:32:43.960]  and infowars life with the highest quality supplements you're going to find out there
[1:32:43.960 --> 1:32:52.520]  I just never get a fever anymore it's probably been three four years since I've had a fever
[1:32:52.520 --> 1:33:00.040]  it's just crazy so I chalk it up to genetics and the great products
[1:33:00.040 --> 1:33:07.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:07.040 --> 1:33:15.040]  we've got it
[1:33:15.040 --> 1:33:24.120]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[1:33:24.120 --> 1:33:33.320]  the info war we've not talked a lot about that case it's been one of the top murder cases
[1:33:33.320 --> 1:33:37.760]  of the last few years it's the media sometimes just chooses what they want to make the big
[1:33:37.760 --> 1:33:43.440]  murder case if it's thousands of people found dead in graves over the texas border in mexico
[1:33:43.440 --> 1:33:47.560]  women and children killed by the cartels zero coverage it'll just be you barely mentioned
[1:33:47.560 --> 1:33:54.920]  I guess one percent coverage but if it's a white male they think it's killed a white
[1:33:54.920 --> 1:34:01.120]  woman and it's I guess a way to demonize the idea of men and women together I've just noticed
[1:34:01.120 --> 1:34:05.760]  they will hype it up that's why people actually believe there's record numbers of police killing
[1:34:05.760 --> 1:34:09.480]  black people even though it's very very rare and most of the shootings are justified I'm
[1:34:09.480 --> 1:34:13.480]  not some brown noser of the police I mean almost all those big police shooting cases
[1:34:13.480 --> 1:34:16.560]  you've seen it turns out the video gets released later and the person attacked him or had a
[1:34:16.560 --> 1:34:20.840]  gun but why does the media and the Justice Department under Obama hype it because it's
[1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:26.400]  creating division well guess what I've got the lawyer right here norm pattis is also
[1:34:26.400 --> 1:34:32.040]  my lawyer and what one of the lawyers you never see this happening this is pretty dangerous
[1:34:32.040 --> 1:34:36.440]  not not one of your lawyers but but one of your a defendants lawyer one of your clients
[1:34:36.440 --> 1:34:43.560]  lawyers has been arrested for conspiracy so this is getting really really crazy I hope
[1:34:43.560 --> 1:34:48.400]  you don't get arrested for conspiracy yeah me too well I mean we were shocked by that
[1:34:48.400 --> 1:34:54.640]  we thought we had pretty good sources in the state police and we did but we got a call
[1:34:54.640 --> 1:34:59.440]  I guess what is today Friday Tuesday morning that there were warrants on the judge's desk
[1:34:59.440 --> 1:35:03.320]  and there were three of them and I'm like three you know I wasn't surprised that Mr.
[1:35:03.320 --> 1:35:08.720]  Doulos was going to be arrested or his girlfriend Michelle Tracanas but the lawyer did catch
[1:35:08.720 --> 1:35:14.160]  me by surprise reading the warrant Alex I don't think there's a snowball's chance in
[1:35:14.160 --> 1:35:20.200]  the hell that Mr. Moini is going to be convicted it it struck me that they arrested him in
[1:35:20.200 --> 1:35:24.560]  an effort to try to turn him as a witness against Mr. Doulos well that's my question
[1:35:24.560 --> 1:35:33.000]  for you is you you represent me in the Connecticut Sandy Hook situation that they're trying to
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:40.160]  make my identity I mean on the night of the new year a week ago or so now 10 days ago
[1:35:40.160 --> 1:35:45.360]  wow yeah every channel just had some minor court thing that blew it up and again trying
[1:35:45.360 --> 1:35:48.840]  to make that my anyone I barely even ever talked about it but that's what they decided
[1:35:48.840 --> 1:35:53.920]  to counter Alan Jones and Info Wars with is questioning you know public events and
[1:35:53.920 --> 1:35:59.720]  things that happen or questioning Jesse Smaller people questioned you know whether the Iranian
[1:35:59.720 --> 1:36:02.800]  general was really killed at first I mean that's a normal thing to do but they're trying
[1:36:02.800 --> 1:36:07.300]  to outlaw questioning things but what but the way you've been death-threatened for representing
[1:36:07.300 --> 1:36:11.840]  me and others and the way people think that people don't have rights to a defense lawyer
[1:36:11.840 --> 1:36:16.400]  or a criminal lawyer or a first amendment lawyer even if I was guilty or someone else
[1:36:16.400 --> 1:36:21.440]  was which I'm not of what they're saying I've done people have a right to that in our system
[1:36:21.440 --> 1:36:26.720]  but this idea now of persecuting lawyers is really frightening it isn't it isn't I mean
[1:36:26.720 --> 1:36:32.360]  that the charges against Mr. Mowenny in the do-los case are unusual getting gas for representing
[1:36:32.360 --> 1:36:37.880]  controversial people goes with the turf so I'm not too put off by the number of threats
[1:36:37.880 --> 1:36:41.840]  we've received in fact it's kind of reassuring to get on email in the morning and have somebody
[1:36:41.840 --> 1:36:45.320]  tell me I'm a vicious piece of scum let's me know I'm doing my work and as I say to
[1:36:45.320 --> 1:36:49.160]  people who do that all the time I'm not going to pay the rent for the space I occupy in
[1:36:49.160 --> 1:36:55.560]  your head go tell it to somebody who cares but don't people get that it's our form of
[1:36:55.560 --> 1:37:00.960]  government and it goes back to English common law it's over a thousand years old and it's
[1:37:00.960 --> 1:37:05.720]  the best system in the world it's not perfect they just there's there's I mean 14% of people
[1:37:05.720 --> 1:37:11.280]  in a national poll think that chocolate milk comes from round cows no no no no that's real
[1:37:11.280 --> 1:37:16.280]  you find is that really true that's true yeah yeah are you telling me it doesn't it doesn't
[1:37:16.280 --> 1:37:20.800]  well where does the strawberry milk come from then strawberry cow oh the pink I saw a pink
[1:37:20.800 --> 1:37:26.280]  cow no wonder there's are so few strawberry milk from a mole rat all right strawberry
[1:37:26.280 --> 1:37:32.400]  milk comes from the young Turks host a mammary land large others here we go utterly ridiculous
[1:37:32.400 --> 1:37:39.840]  yeah no I mean people people don't see it in reporting on it people people I don't know
[1:37:39.840 --> 1:37:44.160]  if people don't get it or not I think everybody hates a lawyer until you need one then when
[1:37:44.160 --> 1:37:48.560]  the lawyers your last hope you love your lawyer but you hate the next guy so it goes with
[1:37:48.560 --> 1:37:54.080]  the turf you know so so strawberry milk is strawberry added to milk comes from the mammaries
[1:37:54.080 --> 1:38:00.640]  of bovine and you're a famous defense lawyer and that's a honorable good thing um I hope
[1:38:00.640 --> 1:38:05.400]  so my wife thinks so most days and my clients think so most days well if we're not supposed
[1:38:05.400 --> 1:38:08.800]  to have defense in this country I mean who are we supposed to have defense then I mean
[1:38:08.800 --> 1:38:12.800]  well we're not supposed to have a defense the mob speaks you know I mean there is no mob
[1:38:12.800 --> 1:38:17.120]  like a self-righteous mob I've told you that before and if you take a controversial stand
[1:38:17.120 --> 1:38:20.480]  and you get enough people who don't like you you're in trouble so for example in the doulos
[1:38:20.480 --> 1:38:25.480]  case how you open the case why has this case captured the world's attention it's because
[1:38:25.480 --> 1:38:31.520]  an upper middle class white woman is missing and if she can't be safe and secure in a spectacular
[1:38:31.520 --> 1:38:35.520]  luxurious home what are the rest of us working so hard to accomplish for so I think we all
[1:38:35.520 --> 1:38:41.080]  feel threatened when somebody living in paradise disappears the level of interest in that case
[1:38:41.080 --> 1:38:45.040]  is overwhelming the other day I walked out of court there were easily a hundred plus
[1:38:45.040 --> 1:38:50.000]  reporters and cameras many of them hissing questions so you know where isn't where is
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:54.920]  Jennifer what did your client do and my my my my responses he didn't do anything he's
[1:38:54.920 --> 1:39:01.120]  been charged we're looking forward to the trial it's kind of twilight zone though because
[1:39:01.120 --> 1:39:04.360]  I'm in the center of the spotlight and so are you I'll be walking through a restaurant
[1:39:04.360 --> 1:39:09.040]  or turn on the TV and it's you and there's like a hundred cameras that's pretty that
[1:39:09.040 --> 1:39:13.840]  is twilight because this is like OJ Simpson level cameras yeah it sort of feels that way
[1:39:13.840 --> 1:39:17.640]  I thought the interest would die no when there's a hundred cameras outside your office that's
[1:39:17.640 --> 1:39:22.000]  OJ Simpson level all right well I mean I expected the interest level to die down but if anything
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:27.560]  it seems to be increasing this morning friends of Jennifer announced that they were supporting
[1:39:27.560 --> 1:39:33.600]  new domestic violence legislation as a result of photos as a rest in my view is that's that's
[1:39:33.600 --> 1:39:37.840]  a massive non sequitur shame on you he hasn't even been tried there's no what it's saying
[1:39:37.840 --> 1:39:42.560]  is you're for violence against women you know if you don't give us money I mean it's just
[1:39:42.560 --> 1:39:47.560]  piggybacking on something you know getting into Sandy Hook not right my my questioning
[1:39:47.560 --> 1:39:52.000]  which have a right to do and then their misrepresentation is what I've said but I've seen in the news
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:56.200]  though and the word is it's bigger that there's a hundred million dollars that's been given
[1:39:56.200 --> 1:40:00.240]  somehow to the families and people and I guess there's more more more well my understanding
[1:40:00.240 --> 1:40:04.480]  that the state attorney general has looked at charitable giving to new town and has identified
[1:40:04.480 --> 1:40:08.840]  about a hundred million dollars that's flowed into that town as in response to the Sandy
[1:40:08.840 --> 1:40:14.240]  Hook shooting where it's all gone what's been done with it is an open question from my perspective
[1:40:14.240 --> 1:40:18.520]  I wonder how much of it's been siphoned into the attack on you and I intend to find out
[1:40:18.520 --> 1:40:24.160]  as the litigation progresses well that's my point is leftists come up to me like drunken
[1:40:24.160 --> 1:40:27.560]  parrots and they go Sandy Hook Sandy Hook and they just started screaming at me anywhere
[1:40:27.560 --> 1:40:32.000]  I go I'll take 20 hands and one of the people comes up like a parrot and I just go Jeffrey
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:37.960]  Epstein Hillary Clinton and then they shut up but it's they keep saying I made my fortune
[1:40:37.960 --> 1:40:41.800]  or I'm all about this thing I barely ever talked about and then they're always using
[1:40:41.800 --> 1:40:46.800]  my name for more publicity and then saying leave us alone stop talking about it stop
[1:40:46.800 --> 1:40:51.360]  it and I'm like sitting season assist letter saying please stop saying I said this I didn't
[1:40:51.360 --> 1:40:55.640]  say this and stop saying it my name because republishing it is so evil and so horrible
[1:40:55.640 --> 1:40:59.640]  you're the ones about the lawyers and people that are republishing our goal is to bring
[1:40:59.640 --> 1:41:03.680]  you peace of mind as to these cases and to close them out as quickly as possible the
[1:41:03.680 --> 1:41:08.920]  Connecticut Supreme Court has been sitting on the decision that we argued in your case
[1:41:08.920 --> 1:41:14.120]  I think September 26 so it's going to be 14 weeks I think this week or yesterday one
[1:41:14.120 --> 1:41:18.000]  of these days we'll get a decision and hopefully we can get it back to the trial court and address
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:21.640]  this with substantive motions and with any luck we'll be and we'll be able to end the
[1:41:21.640 --> 1:41:26.480]  case soon well all these leftist I've seen them celebrating all the news every time there's
[1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:30.200]  some little court thing or a judge says you may have to pay attorney's fees at the end
[1:41:30.200 --> 1:41:34.160]  of this and then the attorney's fees are over a hundred thousand dollars in the last year
[1:41:34.160 --> 1:41:37.520]  in this Texas case that that becomes Jones fine a hundred thousand dollars that's not
[1:41:37.520 --> 1:41:43.720]  what happened it's all this info not as big as a market watch and AP saying that I lost
[1:41:43.720 --> 1:41:47.640]  the suit because nobody died of Sandy Hook book that I didn't write I'm not in the suit
[1:41:47.640 --> 1:41:51.440]  no I hear you but I understand you did have some authorship in the holy Bible am I right
[1:41:51.440 --> 1:41:59.760]  about that no I didn't well wait a minute where did that rumor come from exactly so I'm just
[1:41:59.760 --> 1:42:04.600]  I just can't believe how obsessed they are and how they just just just continue to bring
[1:42:04.600 --> 1:42:10.000]  my name up an association with us crazy you know it is crazy I've not had the prominence
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:13.320]  that you've had in the national imagination but from time to time somebody will write
[1:42:13.320 --> 1:42:17.240]  a story about me and I'm like where did that come from or you know if I'm on trial in a
[1:42:17.240 --> 1:42:21.440]  case in the newspaper I don't read the press coverage because I used to when I was a kid
[1:42:21.440 --> 1:42:24.920]  I'd read it just to see how I was doing and then I'd look at it that's not even what happened
[1:42:24.920 --> 1:42:28.920]  in court yesterday now I don't doubt that reporters are doing their best to get it right
[1:42:28.920 --> 1:42:33.640]  but when it comes to court reporting the answer is they often are a mile from the truth and
[1:42:33.640 --> 1:42:38.360]  the same is true of your case and then people know that now so what's going to happen with
[1:42:38.360 --> 1:42:43.200]  this crisis of confidence in the media because I don't want it to be so horrible I don't
[1:42:43.200 --> 1:42:47.360]  want them to be so deceptive they've clearly gotten much much worse there's been some big
[1:42:47.360 --> 1:42:50.720]  developments in the Justin Smollett case we'll talk about that with Norm Patis straight
[1:42:50.720 --> 1:43:01.040]  at Sunday was supposed to be the last day that we could offer store-wide free shipping
[1:43:01.040 --> 1:43:06.400]  double Patriot points it was 75% off with our big year in sale because a lot of the
[1:43:06.400 --> 1:43:10.600]  products have already sold out most the others are about to sell out but quite frankly I've
[1:43:10.600 --> 1:43:15.000]  been working on so many big stories that are breaking right now that I have not come up
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:19.960]  with new specials and we're already so close to selling out all these products that I'm
[1:43:19.960 --> 1:43:23.920]  just going to go ahead and keep the sale going for two more days and we're going to basically
[1:43:23.920 --> 1:43:29.720]  sell out of all of our major product lines it'll take weeks months for them all to come
[1:43:29.720 --> 1:43:33.280]  back in some come in in weeks some come in like three months a lot of stuff's coming
[1:43:33.280 --> 1:43:38.080]  back in next week so I've just decided because of the inventory issues all of us stuff it
[1:43:38.080 --> 1:43:41.640]  and because some of these were selling it losses are making people buy a lot of other
[1:43:41.640 --> 1:43:46.200]  stuff and we are making a profit so I'm gonna just keep the sale going but only for 48 hours
[1:43:46.200 --> 1:43:53.360]  maximum then we've got to stop it info or store.com year-end now 2020 mega blowout sale info
[1:43:53.360 --> 1:43:58.800]  or store.com biggest sales we're ever gonna have info or store.com we have a new product
[1:43:58.800 --> 1:44:02.800]  and we got several thousand of these in and they're gonna sell out in a few days at the
[1:44:02.800 --> 1:44:06.800]  rate we're selling them want to thank the listeners for getting it but this really is
[1:44:06.800 --> 1:44:12.520]  a game-changing toothpaste and it doesn't compete with super blue that's four to five
[1:44:12.520 --> 1:44:17.360]  a colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride free the adult or the children's these are
[1:44:17.360 --> 1:44:21.880]  both excellent toothpaste concentrates that don't have fillers people love it this is
[1:44:21.880 --> 1:44:28.000]  a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans but also
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:34.320]  re mineralizes the teeth then it has the patented silver salt silver in it to knock out the
[1:44:34.320 --> 1:44:38.480]  bacteria that cause genzavitis this is all proven you can make claims with this but I
[1:44:38.480 --> 1:44:44.480]  had to tell you no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria the viruses
[1:44:44.480 --> 1:44:50.360]  and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel so we're really
[1:44:50.360 --> 1:44:54.840]  proud of it it funds the operation info or store.com that's why we're still on air thanks
[1:44:54.840 --> 1:45:00.720]  to you I would thank you for everything you've done for the info war but I know you're like
[1:45:00.720 --> 1:45:05.520]  me you don't want my thanks you want victory over the globalist and these devil worship
[1:45:05.520 --> 1:45:09.400]  and child molesters and you want them off your back and off your children's back and
[1:45:09.400 --> 1:45:13.640]  you know what I'm the same way and that's why we're on the same damn team and it's
[1:45:13.640 --> 1:45:20.360]  why info wars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to focus
[1:45:20.360 --> 1:45:26.520]  the people on taking action against the globalist because I'm committed to a future for humanity
[1:45:26.520 --> 1:45:31.160]  and I know you are as well so thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are
[1:45:31.160 --> 1:45:36.360]  the info war and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can for
[1:45:36.360 --> 1:45:40.640]  bottom my heart for my family and from the great crew at info wars I want to thank you
[1:45:40.640 --> 1:45:46.360]  all because you are the info war and you know that's not just words that's reality you have
[1:45:46.360 --> 1:45:53.120]  made history we have made history together info wars dot com only has power because
[1:45:53.120 --> 1:46:01.360]  of you and I suggest you use it the globalists know that I will never willingly give up I've
[1:46:01.360 --> 1:46:08.080]  said it many times I will never give in I will never give up but I could give out and
[1:46:08.080 --> 1:46:14.960]  it's very very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity to see evil
[1:46:14.960 --> 1:46:20.320]  running rampant like this and to know that most Americans have already been silenced
[1:46:20.320 --> 1:46:26.240]  in cyberspace that most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech and to know
[1:46:26.240 --> 1:46:33.240]  that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have by spreading
[1:46:33.240 --> 1:46:38.600]  the word about news wars dot com info wars dot com and banned on video and that people
[1:46:38.600 --> 1:46:43.080]  are hungry for the truth now more than ever and then if you tell people hey the banned
[1:46:43.080 --> 1:46:47.840]  truth they don't want you to have is it info wars dot com forward slash show and banned
[1:46:47.840 --> 1:46:52.920]  on video so take heart folks they've had to censor everybody and show everybody down because
[1:46:52.920 --> 1:47:01.120]  the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square you're listening to the
[1:47:01.120 --> 1:47:26.240]  alex jones show info wars dot com is tomorrow's news today you're listening to the alex jones
[1:47:26.240 --> 1:47:46.160]  show now you're not satisfied you've been doing great oh and you're going to finish
[1:47:46.160 --> 1:47:50.200]  up with these calls within greg rees and of course harrison smith they're going to take
[1:47:50.200 --> 1:47:54.880]  another hour calls the cruise volunteered to do it so we're here live covering this hoping
[1:47:54.880 --> 1:47:58.920]  everything de-escalates so the live coverage continues everybody spread those links the
[1:47:58.920 --> 1:48:03.200]  globes are hacking us trying to shut this down don't let them win no bs let me tell
[1:48:03.200 --> 1:48:06.200]  you everything straight shooting here so you don't have some macky valley manipulative
[1:48:06.200 --> 1:48:15.720]  view with me it's all straightforward attack that's the real power well there you go that
[1:48:15.720 --> 1:48:19.880]  was a fun little thing darren Mcgreen put together norm paddus is going to ride shotgun
[1:48:19.880 --> 1:48:24.320]  with us in the next hour because he's a big defender of free speech we have an amazing
[1:48:24.320 --> 1:48:27.840]  lady who is one of the top journalists of the middle east i mean she's super famous
[1:48:27.840 --> 1:48:35.360]  over there she was arrested during the coup that obama and others financed over our allies
[1:48:35.360 --> 1:48:39.400]  in egypt and then put the muslim brotherhood in charge she's going to give us her take
[1:48:39.400 --> 1:48:42.400]  on free speech worldwide i figure you might want to ride shotgun with us i'd love to hear
[1:48:42.400 --> 1:48:46.680]  that yeah but before i get into the jessie smollett development because it ties into
[1:48:46.680 --> 1:48:55.040]  the whole surveillance state just in general you are a bookstore owner as well and i really
[1:48:55.040 --> 1:48:58.520]  respect that because that's that's going to be a more and more precious as as big text
[1:48:58.520 --> 1:49:02.840]  allowed to censor and control and kind of digitally burn information they can go in
[1:49:02.840 --> 1:49:07.440]  with an algorithm and say everything on google that has alex jones voice can be erased i said
[1:49:07.440 --> 1:49:10.360]  that ten years ago because they had the technology now they're saying they're going to start
[1:49:10.360 --> 1:49:15.400]  doing it or they hear your voice they block it the same technology they can do for music
[1:49:15.400 --> 1:49:20.000]  so it's a very very dangerous future that's already here
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:23.200]  why do you think the establishment has made the decision clearly a long time ago they're
[1:49:23.200 --> 1:49:30.400]  just getting to the point now of going operational to totally use tech to to to to to surveil and
[1:49:30.400 --> 1:49:36.040]  control in real time and as sasha bary cohen said reading an adl battle plan they want
[1:49:36.040 --> 1:49:40.560]  everything we say on the internet a one hour hold approved by the southern primary law center
[1:49:40.560 --> 1:49:44.720]  and the adl he actually said that we're there reading what you say and what you do anywhere
[1:49:44.720 --> 1:49:50.080]  even in private messaging they want he said that what's up cnn wants to do that in a lifetime
[1:49:50.080 --> 1:49:56.400]  surveilling you prior restraint what do you call that in law well a prior a decision about
[1:49:56.400 --> 1:50:01.080]  whether speech can be published is a prior restraint now when the government does it
[1:50:01.080 --> 1:50:05.960]  it's actually absolutely prohibited when big tech does it it's not prohibited yet by the
[1:50:05.960 --> 1:50:10.000]  first amendment so the discussion we need to have in this country is whether big tech
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:14.920]  is so large and monopolistic that it becomes quasi-governmental because and i'd say there's
[1:50:14.920 --> 1:50:19.520]  a good argument that it is because we give grant them immunity from suit under the communication
[1:50:19.520 --> 1:50:24.840]  decency act so i think that you know so that's the argument in favor of free speech you ask
[1:50:24.840 --> 1:50:30.120]  why big tech does it because they can and social control is profitable if they harvest
[1:50:30.120 --> 1:50:35.200]  all of your metadata every click about what you visit and they they apply machine learning
[1:50:35.200 --> 1:50:39.480]  to that and they recognize patterns you may not be aware of they can predict what you're
[1:50:39.480 --> 1:50:44.120]  going to do and they can control you and hasn't that been the dream of autocrats everywhere
[1:50:44.120 --> 1:50:49.480]  forever that's been the holy grail and now we can actually do it and so you know that
[1:50:49.480 --> 1:50:54.720]  they're there we each create digital trails that yield the ability to predict what we're
[1:50:54.720 --> 1:50:59.080]  going to do next and with prediction comes control and you know i don't think many people
[1:50:59.080 --> 1:51:03.160]  care um you know it's funny over because they say i don't think to hide well then why do
[1:51:03.160 --> 1:51:06.800]  you put your wallet your back pocket so somebody can't get it as easy or your front pocket
[1:51:06.800 --> 1:51:10.480]  why do you have walls why do you have doors why do you work clothing why do you have screens
[1:51:10.480 --> 1:51:14.400]  on your on your on your windows because there's bad things that can come in well i mean here
[1:51:14.400 --> 1:51:17.440]  you know here's a bad i shouldn't confess this but you know my wife and i are home over
[1:51:17.440 --> 1:51:21.560]  the holidays we've got alexa on whom we really use and we wanted to hear some christmas music
[1:51:21.560 --> 1:51:26.000]  alexa play christmas music and i knew damn well that alexa was listening and that when
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:30.280]  you did i'd invited this electronic ear into the house but for the convenience of listening
[1:51:30.280 --> 1:51:35.240]  to christmas carols i was willing to sacrifice privacy i think more and more people are seduced
[1:51:35.240 --> 1:51:39.960]  by gadgetry and convenience and they're willing to give it up until they've given up too much
[1:51:39.960 --> 1:51:43.480]  and then it'll be too late the other night i was robbing home with my wife we've been
[1:51:43.480 --> 1:51:47.600]  out of the movie and the baby said it was about to leave we're hurrying home and i'm
[1:51:47.600 --> 1:51:51.760]  and i'm telling her hey these phones these new updates are always turning on not just
[1:51:51.760 --> 1:52:01.480]  when you say hey siri but at other times well i said watch this start screaming don't kill
[1:52:01.480 --> 1:52:08.600]  me help and the phone's sitting right there i'm in the center console of my dodge vehicle
[1:52:08.600 --> 1:52:12.240]  and she starts screaming and everything and the thing turns on and is sitting there and
[1:52:12.240 --> 1:52:16.240]  she she absolutely was freaked out well here's another story a friend of mine is a psychiatrist
[1:52:16.240 --> 1:52:20.880]  and he tells me that in two recent occasions he and his patients have discussed some particular
[1:52:20.880 --> 1:52:25.800]  topic within 24 hours the patients read in their private sessions with their phones off
[1:52:25.800 --> 1:52:31.200]  oh yeah the patients got advertisements oh yeah that's all absolutely that's admitted going
[1:52:31.200 --> 1:52:36.920]  back at least a decade in terms of service with sam tongs tv's it says literally we're
[1:52:36.920 --> 1:52:42.100]  going to sell the audio and more to third parties so watch what you say wow it actually
[1:52:42.100 --> 1:52:47.920]  says watch what you say i like to say i mean i was on a radio show not long ago and i wanted
[1:52:47.920 --> 1:52:51.280]  to see if it would work i don't know if it did so we were talking about this very topic
[1:52:51.280 --> 1:52:55.920]  and i said siri play purple haze and i don't know how many people got jimmy hendrix on
[1:52:55.920 --> 1:53:00.200]  that day or whether siri doesn't listen to the radio we didn't know that's absolutely
[1:53:00.200 --> 1:53:06.520]  right and that's called training of siri training audience training and where they're actually
[1:53:06.520 --> 1:53:11.880]  doing that now with radio and tv that's why they're now adding a big network sub tones
[1:53:11.880 --> 1:53:17.520]  that communicate with it you ever seen how in star wars made back in the 1970s how do
[1:53:17.520 --> 1:53:22.080]  the robots communicate well that's because they went to engineers and said i want a robot
[1:53:22.080 --> 1:53:26.480]  talk yeah so it's the secret world of machines it turns out all these devices even down to
[1:53:26.480 --> 1:53:32.040]  toasters now and and smart refrigerators even digital radios are putting out sub audible
[1:53:32.040 --> 1:53:40.400]  tones and tones that are above audible and that way there's not even wireless connections
[1:53:40.400 --> 1:53:44.920]  but they're communicating that way and then transmitting the data compressed to each other
[1:53:44.920 --> 1:53:49.240]  and so that's what they're doing it's terrifying i mean it's terrifying but what are we going
[1:53:49.240 --> 1:53:53.640]  to do about it it's almost like it's gone too far how do you go back at well what is
[1:53:53.640 --> 1:54:00.360]  our to say when you see something scary but remember captain crunch back in the seventies
[1:54:00.360 --> 1:54:03.520]  was able to call into the white house able to get on the line with nixon and get through
[1:54:03.520 --> 1:54:08.760]  codes and stuff because he could whistle so good off of the you know the telephone code
[1:54:08.760 --> 1:54:13.160]  system you have a telephone code of course those guys use a phone with codes they plug
[1:54:13.160 --> 1:54:19.320]  into your phone you can do it with your voice wow that's that's a very new world the first
[1:54:19.320 --> 1:54:24.240]  hacker scary stuff we've had it on the show but but again and i'm not trying to one up
[1:54:24.240 --> 1:54:27.280]  each time you mentioned something i never even thought about them listening to your private
[1:54:27.280 --> 1:54:35.440]  conversations with your psychiatrists but this is what's going on i'm just watching
[1:54:35.440 --> 1:54:40.200]  the thing and it's a scary world i we don't seem to be prepared to stop it at all we're
[1:54:40.200 --> 1:54:45.640]  not making the effort there is not a sophisticated effort at privacy for privacy and i do this
[1:54:45.640 --> 1:54:49.120]  all the time too when i'm i they'll put something on screen i'll like pause and that's just
[1:54:49.120 --> 1:54:52.640]  part of being distracted with television isn't it weird to be in a tv studio like this yeah
[1:54:52.640 --> 1:54:57.160]  it is i'm i'm trying not to watch you know i'm trying not to watch i've learned a long
[1:54:57.160 --> 1:55:00.720]  time ago as a lawyer never read your own press now i'm learning sitting with you never look
[1:55:00.720 --> 1:55:04.160]  at yourself on the screen because you're thinking man he looks so much better than i do it's
[1:55:04.160 --> 1:55:10.400]  just not fair oh yeah all right the marathon runner over here this guy's mean you tell ya
[1:55:10.400 --> 1:55:15.000]  there you go early hackers use whistles from captain crunch cereal boxes and the guy that
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:20.040]  taught him how to do it got the nicknamed captain crunch but i know new listeners they'll like
[1:55:20.040 --> 1:55:24.920]  young turks and cnn play clips and he's saying this ago look how crazy he says there's animal
[1:55:24.920 --> 1:55:30.800]  human clones in china the ability to take a snippet and make it into the whole presentation
[1:55:30.800 --> 1:55:35.840]  of a person is just plain wrong and i'm not oh you know i mean i one of the things i like
[1:55:35.840 --> 1:55:40.520]  most about coming out to see you candidly is the the ride in the cab from the airport
[1:55:40.520 --> 1:55:46.120]  to the hotel because i get to talk to a real person who's not mediated by electronic chatter
[1:55:46.120 --> 1:55:49.560]  who's not an adversary in a courtroom and i get to find out what people are thinking
[1:55:49.560 --> 1:55:53.200]  about what's life on the street well how often do you get to just go and shake the hand of
[1:55:53.200 --> 1:55:56.920]  a stranger and say how you doing today where i was obsessed with real contact with real
[1:55:56.920 --> 1:56:00.840]  people and that's the difference between america and europe was all about royalty alton senator
[1:56:00.840 --> 1:56:05.840]  tokeville wrote about that it was about you know realizing the real innovation and stuff
[1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:10.080]  comes from the grassroots and when you celebrate the grassroots it makes it even more powerful
[1:56:10.080 --> 1:56:14.280]  and makes it more vibrant but everything today is about suppressing the grassroots and programming
[1:56:14.280 --> 1:56:18.640]  us with hollywood garbage you know i go out all the time and you know i take security
[1:56:18.640 --> 1:56:23.400]  with me if i'm going into what i call it blue zone any leftist area any zombie infested
[1:56:23.400 --> 1:56:28.560]  area downtown austin congress street i still go to those zones i do usually take a security
[1:56:28.560 --> 1:56:34.240]  person with me and it's just it's just something that has to be done but most areas i people
[1:56:34.240 --> 1:56:38.880]  love him for us so the enemy propaganda to hate us has not worked it's funny you should
[1:56:38.880 --> 1:56:43.120]  mention that i remember being out with you one evening at a local eatery and you stopped
[1:56:43.120 --> 1:56:47.120]  to talk to some people and they were smiling and all of a sudden the temperature level
[1:56:47.120 --> 1:56:50.640]  began to rise and they weren't smiling because they liked you they were smiling because they
[1:56:50.640 --> 1:56:55.800]  were telling you off and they were wishing harm to your family and i was like really
[1:56:55.800 --> 1:56:59.640]  this is saturday night and i was walking by and i shook the hands of some listeners
[1:56:59.640 --> 1:57:02.800]  right and then somebody goes i hope you die yeah i couldn't because they're trying to
[1:57:02.800 --> 1:57:06.280]  provoke me and then they all got their camera waiting because they all plan it but here's
[1:57:06.280 --> 1:57:09.960]  the funny thing you had that confrontation and the thought occurred to me do i want to
[1:57:09.960 --> 1:57:14.040]  get into this fight in austin and i thought well okay but then when it was over and you
[1:57:14.040 --> 1:57:18.960]  disengaged they they sat there looking smug but everybody in the restaurant everybody
[1:57:18.960 --> 1:57:23.400]  else clapped for you not for them so keep doing what you're doing i remember that yeah
[1:57:23.400 --> 1:57:27.200]  i remember it very well it was the night that i knew i was being retained in the doulos
[1:57:27.200 --> 1:57:31.280]  case you and i talked about that and we're leaving and i'm thinking do i really want
[1:57:31.280 --> 1:57:35.400]  to spend the night in austin jail and i think i was measured enough though when i got my
[1:57:35.400 --> 1:57:40.240]  family f you and your family you know here's what i would tell you i'd said it already
[1:57:40.240 --> 1:57:43.640]  today don't back in 70 seconds then we'll hit the small it news and we got other guests
[1:57:43.640 --> 1:57:49.520]  joining us i love watching david night in the morning i love tuning in to oh and shroyer
[1:57:49.520 --> 1:57:53.980]  i love all the other shows we do here but i'll be honest with you we run during the
[1:57:53.980 --> 1:57:59.480]  breaks a lot of news reports because i'm sick of hearing the ads so you think you don't
[1:57:59.480 --> 1:58:03.760]  want to hear an ad i don't want to hear an ad but here's the bottom line we're barely
[1:58:03.760 --> 1:58:07.680]  paying the bills here and i want to expand the face the globalist not contract i don't
[1:58:07.680 --> 1:58:13.040]  want them to win so listen you've got this guarantee for me we saw enough product we'll
[1:58:13.040 --> 1:58:17.200]  have less ads and less plugs and we'll expand and really give the globalist rough their
[1:58:17.200 --> 1:58:22.480]  money but we've got products you already really need like dna force plus x2 these will change

[1:58:48.760 --> 1:58:54.040]  toothpaste because i hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half and i told
[1:58:54.040 --> 1:58:57.440]  alex i said man this is the best toothpaste i've ever tried he's like well what are you
[1:58:57.440 --> 1:59:00.960]  doing just sitting in here telling me you got to get up there and tell people and so
[1:59:00.960 --> 1:59:06.840]  here i am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste i've
[1:59:06.840 --> 1:59:11.880]  ever tried and i'm 45 years old and i've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride
[1:59:11.880 --> 1:59:17.000]  free i think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after
[1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:21.960]  i brush my teeth with this they feel so clean and the toothpaste that i don't even like rinse
[1:59:21.960 --> 1:59:28.000]  out my mouth after i brush my teeth with this it feels so good it feels like it feels like
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:33.680]  good things are happening in my mouth in fact i find myself brushing my teeth three to four
[1:59:33.680 --> 1:59:50.040]  times a day rather than just twice a day now because i like the way it feels
[1:59:50.040 --> 2:00:11.000]  we're listening to the alex jones show big brother mainstream media government cover-ups

[2:01:00.520 --> 2:01:05.400]  got a lot of stuff going on norm you're getting into going into the blue zone i picked up at
[2:01:05.400 --> 2:01:11.040]  your hotel we were hungry when we've been doing some stuff we went over and ate at a mexican
[2:01:11.040 --> 2:01:17.120]  food restaurant that's in the blue zone on south lamar near downtown and you were getting
[2:01:17.120 --> 2:01:21.920]  into what happened yes so we're you know we're leaving and people are stopping to shake your
[2:01:21.920 --> 2:01:26.920]  hand and i'm just enjoying enjoying the spectacle of it all we turn the corner to leave and
[2:01:26.920 --> 2:01:30.920]  i look and you're not there and you're stopping you're bent over talking to somebody and he's
[2:01:30.920 --> 2:01:35.600]  smiling at you like he's happy to see you and then i hear the f-bomb dropped in reference
[2:01:35.600 --> 2:01:40.200]  to you and your family too and i i couldn't figure it out i'm like is this some sort of
[2:01:40.200 --> 2:01:44.360]  inside joke and you looked at him as though to say really what did you just say and bent
[2:01:44.360 --> 2:01:48.840]  over and and i don't recall the exact conversation i don't know that i would have thereafter
[2:01:48.840 --> 2:01:54.480]  i was shocked but it quickly descended into fighting words and so i'm thinking what are
[2:01:54.480 --> 2:01:57.640]  you know as a lawyer what are my responsibilities here and then i said yeah the hell with the
[2:01:57.640 --> 2:02:01.000]  lawyerly thing what are my responsibilities as a man and a friend i turned around you
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:04.120]  were all ready to go i was yeah i was like three well i mean there are three or four
[2:02:04.120 --> 2:02:07.200]  of them there and it was you i don't doubt you could have taken care of them but it wouldn't
[2:02:07.200 --> 2:02:11.160]  have been sporting so i was going to try to level the playing field a little bit um and
[2:02:11.160 --> 2:02:17.080]  so then you know you basically told them off and as you stood up um and the restaurant
[2:02:17.080 --> 2:02:21.080]  fell quiet everyone turned to look well yeah i got in his face i leaned right down over
[2:02:21.080 --> 2:02:24.560]  his food well you did yeah no and then people clapped that happened a few months ago and
[2:02:24.560 --> 2:02:28.160]  i just reached over took a piece of the guy steak and ate it did you really yeah and probably
[2:02:28.160 --> 2:02:31.560]  then was it good he was he says we kicked my ass i said we'll get up and he wouldn't
[2:02:31.560 --> 2:02:36.560]  do it so then i just leaned over and said because you're a coward you're showing off your wife
[2:02:36.560 --> 2:02:38.960]  because this is the third dimension buddy this ain't the internet where you act tough
[2:02:38.960 --> 2:02:43.040]  and i ate a steak well i shouldn't even tell us stories but just go ahead no i mean i can
[2:02:43.040 --> 2:02:48.080]  that's a that's a kind of gutsy move you're gonna kick my my whatever well i'm gonna eat
[2:02:48.080 --> 2:02:51.760]  your steak i'm gonna eat a medium rare i'm gonna eat a medium well i'm gonna eat a well
[2:02:51.760 --> 2:02:55.480]  they say f u your family that's these weird leftists now i told the story of these big
[2:02:55.480 --> 2:02:59.040]  gay dudes they literally told me they were gay they were like six two six three we had
[2:02:59.040 --> 2:03:02.720]  an international snowboarding championship in veil they were flying back from denver
[2:03:02.720 --> 2:03:06.320]  to austin with us they started a fight with my son he's really big now this is two years
[2:03:06.320 --> 2:03:10.200]  ago but he was you know he looked like he was about 17 then he's 17 now looks like he's
[2:03:10.200 --> 2:03:16.120]  25 the linebacker uh you know for some college team but they they they were going to f u
[2:03:16.120 --> 2:03:19.280]  to me and he said hey leave my dad alone well later they started a fight with him at the
[2:03:19.280 --> 2:03:23.520]  baggage area this room years ago they went to him and we're trying to start a fight sorry
[2:03:23.520 --> 2:03:27.800]  go ahead years ago years ago i represented a guy who'd been shot by a hit man and we
[2:03:27.800 --> 2:03:31.880]  determined that this was a part of a business dispute these were very prominent weightlifters
[2:03:31.880 --> 2:03:36.160]  and we knew who paid for it so i went down to visit the guy he was in the belglades correctional
[2:03:36.160 --> 2:03:40.720]  center in belglades florida and he came out for his deposition in the prison with these
[2:03:40.720 --> 2:03:44.760]  ray band glasses and he wouldn't swear the oath and i'm sitting across the table from
[2:03:44.760 --> 2:03:49.920]  him and he says i know you you think you're a tough guy don't you and i said no not really
[2:03:49.920 --> 2:03:52.840]  but i'm pretty determined i'm going to get some answers and i've come here to answer
[2:03:52.840 --> 2:03:57.520]  some questions and he looked at me says i'm not going to answer your questions and i said
[2:03:57.520 --> 2:04:01.000]  well i've traveled a long way all the way down from kinetic here to sunny florida and
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  it's not because i like the view um and he swore at me and i looked at him and i said
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:09.520]  sir well i know bubba and your buddies down here haven't been treating you well but i
[2:04:09.520 --> 2:04:16.640]  got news for you when i like females i like females in skirts and you wouldn't look good
[2:04:16.640 --> 2:04:22.440]  in skirts a h and the guy leapt across the table at me and the guards separated him
[2:04:22.440 --> 2:04:27.680]  so we didn't do the deposition and then i sued him for costs and seized his commissary account
[2:04:27.680 --> 2:04:33.480]  for a while to defray the the cost of the cost of my flight down there in the end we
[2:04:33.480 --> 2:04:38.400]  won the case um he ended up doing some more time and he'd periodically threatened my life
[2:04:38.400 --> 2:04:43.200]  and i'd get calls from the doc saying that this guy was out to get me um and you know
[2:04:43.200 --> 2:04:47.600]  here i am so as i said to the last guy who threatened to shoot me to my face um i said
[2:04:47.600 --> 2:04:51.600]  if you shoot me get me right here in the phone i love it because if you get me anywhere there
[2:04:51.600 --> 2:04:56.480]  no if you get me anywhere else i'm going to hurt you on the way down i spend a lot of

[2:06:31.520 --> 2:06:36.960]  that's a lot of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the american people and that is
[2:06:36.960 --> 2:06:42.480]  really really an awful situation we are not the enemy of the american people we love the american

[2:07:25.760 --> 2:07:53.280]  we are back live broadcasting worldwide i am your host alex jones famous constitutional lawyer
[2:07:53.280 --> 2:07:58.080]  criminal lawyer first woman lawyer norm patis this year you were talking about internet surveillance
[2:07:58.080 --> 2:08:02.720]  and how dangerous it is and there's a lot of things to be done with this system that we're
[2:08:02.720 --> 2:08:08.000]  going to like but that's the road to hell being paved with good intentions we have a very special
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:12.240]  investigative journalist uh joining us coming up in the next segment normally this article
[2:08:12.240 --> 2:08:18.480]  by kellen nick green on info wars dot com judge orders google to turn over one year of jesse small
[2:08:18.480 --> 2:08:23.360]  it's data now clearly he did it the the the guys that did it have admitted they did it for him under
[2:08:23.360 --> 2:08:28.080]  pay they have the video of them buying the ski masks and the rope all the same store it's all
[2:08:28.080 --> 2:08:34.000]  fake it was to reboost the show uh saying he's under a right wing trump attack um the show
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:39.760]  is probably in on it maxine water says it's fine he did it he's now had charges dropped on him as
[2:08:39.760 --> 2:08:45.680]  you know and he's suing the police for false arrest and false prosecution and a bunch of craziness
[2:08:45.680 --> 2:08:50.640]  so now a judge is ruled that google is going to give his metadata his travel data everything he
[2:08:50.640 --> 2:08:56.320]  wrote or said on the emails uh over to them and you know that's going to do to small it he's not
[2:08:56.320 --> 2:09:01.360]  really planned this out too well apparently not he though it's very difficult to sue a police officer
[2:09:01.360 --> 2:09:06.400]  for false arrest or malicious prosecution you have to show a judge to survive the motions and get to
[2:09:06.400 --> 2:09:10.880]  a jury that the action was altogether lacking in probable cause in other words there was no
[2:09:10.880 --> 2:09:16.080]  reasonable basis to believe that the person engaged in the conduct complained of as small
[2:09:16.080 --> 2:09:20.880]  and i'm not sure why they dropped the charge um you know i mean i think he's not going to be able
[2:09:20.880 --> 2:09:26.080]  to prevail on that suit now if in the google metadata and data it turns out that they can show
[2:09:26.080 --> 2:09:30.160]  conclusively that he planned that he's going to get charged all over again um and you know the
[2:09:30.160 --> 2:09:34.240]  fact that the charges were dropped the first time doesn't toll the statute limitations
[2:09:34.240 --> 2:09:39.280]  i don't know whether that's a one-year or a five-year statute um off the top of my head um but
[2:09:39.280 --> 2:09:43.520]  we'll find out i'm surprised though that google turned it over it's hard to get social media to
[2:09:43.520 --> 2:09:49.360]  cooperate with law enforcement you know but that's going to be happening more and more uh social
[2:09:49.360 --> 2:09:52.640]  media doesn't like to cooperate because it shows they're surveilling and recording everything now
[2:09:52.640 --> 2:10:00.000]  we have courses uh you know being taught uh at major colleges for how law enforcement does get
[2:10:01.040 --> 2:10:07.760]  the records of siri of alexa of all these things that are recording you basically all the time
[2:10:07.760 --> 2:10:11.680]  and now in court cases those recordings are being brought in well here's the problem with that too i
[2:10:11.680 --> 2:10:17.760]  learned by surprise and by accident in a in a connecticut case that um a judge made an order
[2:10:17.760 --> 2:10:22.640]  that facebook had to turn something over to the defense and the and facebook didn't do it so we
[2:10:22.640 --> 2:10:27.680]  filed a motion uh to compel facebook to do it they ignored that so i did what's called a capious warrant
[2:10:27.680 --> 2:10:33.120]  for mark zuckerberg and we had him served at his home um and that was to hold him in contempt of court
[2:10:33.120 --> 2:10:38.960]  for failure to obey the uh obey the court's order facebook got a lawyer and we sat down and talked
[2:10:38.960 --> 2:10:45.600]  and here's what i learned from facebook's internal communications um they will comply with a subpoena
[2:10:45.600 --> 2:10:50.080]  from law enforcement from the state or from the government they will not comply with a subpoena
[2:10:50.080 --> 2:10:55.200]  from defense counsel how does that work how is it that the truth serves one side and not the other
[2:10:55.200 --> 2:11:00.160]  how is it that the truth serves power but not people who the power is supposed to serve and if
[2:11:00.160 --> 2:11:05.120]  this show wasn't live once it's taped i want to put the sound of a car crash right there when you
[2:11:05.120 --> 2:11:12.320]  just said that they will respond to a subpoena by prosecutors or by government but not by defense
[2:11:12.320 --> 2:11:18.000]  if that precedent continues and everything's based on this then this is truly a nightmare system of
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:23.680]  the technocracy and that's another key point now authoritarian it is from its very onset well and
[2:11:23.680 --> 2:11:30.560]  it's in that yes yes and it's also a a key part of the argument that says we should apply first
[2:11:30.560 --> 2:11:35.600]  amendment standards to these entities because they become quasi-governmental in how they behave
[2:11:35.600 --> 2:11:39.280]  if you're willing to share everything you own with the government but not with a private person
[2:11:39.280 --> 2:11:43.920]  you begin to behave like the government and you begin to become an arm of the government um so
[2:11:43.920 --> 2:11:48.720]  that that we have we have a suit pending against facebook for banning a Connecticut person from
[2:11:48.720 --> 2:11:54.000]  social media along with law student named Cameron Atkinson and we've pled that as one of the factors
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:59.200]  that the court should consider in determining that that facebook is quasi-governmental well they
[2:11:59.200 --> 2:12:05.120]  advertise their utility and so they have liability protection section 230 right uh and what is the
[2:12:05.120 --> 2:12:09.200]  answer strip them of the immunity no because in the eu and the globalists and the chai comms are
[2:12:09.200 --> 2:12:13.600]  coming in saying their regulations are over the trump in the new trade law says no they still
[2:12:13.600 --> 2:12:19.120]  have the immunity okay but then you can't then sit there and have it all programmed to censor
[2:12:19.120 --> 2:12:24.800]  everybody especially people that expose sexualization of children uh radical islam's expansion these
[2:12:24.800 --> 2:12:30.400]  things are being protected particularly by big tech and they're meeting and and making agreements
[2:12:30.400 --> 2:12:37.440]  and and acting as as combines on february on january eighth rather of 2019 i killed my facebook
[2:12:37.440 --> 2:12:41.760]  account it's been almost a year and i did it because i was so outraged to learn that they're
[2:12:41.760 --> 2:12:46.240]  profiting off of me taking my data selling it recombining it and then they're going to tell me
[2:12:46.240 --> 2:12:52.240]  what i can and can't post by opaque standards that i can't know that's offensive but you know alex i
[2:12:52.240 --> 2:12:57.680]  miss it i met a lot of people there i like mouth and off i like vigorous debate but i can't go back
[2:12:57.680 --> 2:13:02.000]  to facebook anymore than i could walk into a locker room with a tube of vaseline and say to
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:08.640]  everybody there have at it fellas it's just not in me and it's that american spirit of rugged
[2:13:08.640 --> 2:13:13.120]  individualism that's going to be the answer and and facebook and google and apple and and twitter
[2:13:13.120 --> 2:13:17.040]  when you try to set up an alternative they go and get you deplatformed they go after the server
[2:13:17.040 --> 2:13:22.560]  companies uh they do it all the media gangs up on you if one person says kill somebody on gab
[2:13:22.560 --> 2:13:27.440]  but they try to ban it but then a guy massacres people on facebook and that's okay well cool yeah
[2:13:27.440 --> 2:13:32.720]  because the guy did it live it's very you're scary but you don't ban everybody's live streaming
[2:13:32.720 --> 2:13:37.120]  because a bad person did something wrong with something you know you don't but um it's well
[2:13:37.120 --> 2:13:41.840]  it's the it's the same argument over and over and over again um you know i think we can thank
[2:13:41.840 --> 2:13:45.920]  adam walsh and folks like that for you know something catastrophic happens in your family
[2:13:45.920 --> 2:13:49.840]  and you conclude that you should become a spokesman for interest broader than your grief
[2:13:49.840 --> 2:13:55.600]  and then we end up with these patchwork quilts of legal regulations and rules that make no sense
[2:13:55.600 --> 2:14:00.560]  because they're grounded in pathos not reason we need to get back to a situation in this country
[2:14:00.560 --> 2:14:06.080]  where people can debate calmly and dispassionately about what's in the public interest and that means
[2:14:06.080 --> 2:14:10.800]  no holes barred debate um you can't decide that because you know alex jones says things
[2:14:10.800 --> 2:14:16.000]  that are controversial he's too hateful to be listened to the minute you're shut down the
[2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:20.160]  country is impoverished in my view i may not always agree sometimes i don't even understand
[2:14:20.160 --> 2:14:24.640]  everything you say um but boy i'll fight to the death for your right to say it because when your
[2:14:24.640 --> 2:14:30.000]  voice is gone um what's what's left well sometimes i don't understand what i say i'll hear something
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:34.720]  in hindsight and i'm like what was i thinking when i said that it should because i'm not pre-programming
[2:14:34.720 --> 2:14:38.480]  i'm not getting everything ready and written down what i'm going to say and then sometimes
[2:14:38.480 --> 2:14:44.400]  a lot's going on and you know who knows you know maybe sometimes like they come in and are serving
[2:14:44.400 --> 2:14:49.360]  me with with with a service deal and the service person standing here and i'm talking on air so
[2:14:49.360 --> 2:14:53.600]  or or my wife comes to the office or my kids are running around and then i kind of scramble something
[2:14:53.600 --> 2:14:57.280]  you know i'm glad to hear you say that you know i have to unfortunately read transcripts any number
[2:14:57.280 --> 2:15:01.440]  of times of cases i've been in and you know i'll come home my wife will say how was your day oh
[2:15:01.440 --> 2:15:05.440]  pretty good i really kicked so and so where it hurt you know and then i'll read the transcript and
[2:15:05.440 --> 2:15:10.640]  i'm looking like a blind man walking into a wall we're doing our best in real time with the situations
[2:15:10.640 --> 2:15:14.640]  that confront us as they do and sometimes we mess up that's the way it is what about the days where
[2:15:14.640 --> 2:15:18.800]  you got to do the case but you got a stomach bug or something you're just making yourself go through
[2:15:18.800 --> 2:15:23.760]  it but the weirdest thing is under that kind of stress sometimes i say the best stuff yeah i think
[2:15:23.760 --> 2:15:28.160]  when i have more the i've i have found that the same you know there from time to time i've lost a
[2:15:28.160 --> 2:15:31.760]  brief for an appellate court by hitting the wrong key and then i have to rewrite it quickly the
[2:15:31.760 --> 2:15:35.520]  rewrites are always better because that's when the pressure is on and i don't have time to
[2:15:35.520 --> 2:15:39.680]  dilly dally and shoot myself that's right let's play danger zone we come in with a lady that's

[2:18:10.080 --> 2:18:16.480]  and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in france noticed that people who ate certain
[2:18:16.480 --> 2:18:22.400]  quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this
[2:18:22.400 --> 2:18:28.320]  effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast acting

[2:19:04.720 --> 2:19:10.720]  people that end up getting the flu have taken the flu vaccine right before they get it and
[2:19:10.720 --> 2:19:18.160]  they get the worst case of the flu of their life but still by concentration camp victims
[2:19:18.160 --> 2:19:24.640]  they line up at the different pharmacies and clinics to get the injections it doesn't matter
[2:19:24.640 --> 2:19:30.160]  that studies mainline government studies in canada and europe show that when you take the flu vaccine
[2:19:30.160 --> 2:19:35.840]  it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next season by lowering your immunity it goes on
[2:19:35.840 --> 2:19:41.680]  and on or the fact that the governments have never guessed the next year's mutation at the flu
[2:19:41.680 --> 2:19:49.360]  vaccine has never ever even worked but how do you prop up a hoax you keep the giant hoax going

[2:21:34.080 --> 2:21:41.840]  start i mean in the in the context of all of this i would like to tell president donald trump
[2:21:41.840 --> 2:21:48.880]  thank you for finally getting rid of uh what the worst monster in the middle east
[2:21:50.880 --> 2:21:58.240]  uh this man was more dangerous than osama bin laden uh the blind shake who was the godfather
[2:21:58.240 --> 2:22:06.720]  of islamic terrorism and uh al-bar daddy of isis combined this is one of the most dangerous
[2:22:06.720 --> 2:22:15.680]  monsters on planet earth and finally president trump uh did the right thing so it's a it's a
[2:22:15.680 --> 2:22:22.240]  it's a great great achievement of his administration of his foreign policy well he was on the
[2:22:22.240 --> 2:22:30.240]  terrorist uh so how is trump a war criminal now the democrats as you know wanting impeach for
[2:22:30.240 --> 2:22:35.840]  killing sullamani who's admittedly bragged about creating the worldwide ied program that killed
[2:22:35.840 --> 2:22:46.480]  thousands of troops well it's not new uh they have been on the wrong side of history consistently
[2:22:46.480 --> 2:22:52.560]  for hundreds of years and leftists that's the mode of operation it's never going to change we are
[2:22:52.560 --> 2:22:59.440]  dealing with this disaster right now because president jimmy carter that was there's an israeli
[2:22:59.440 --> 2:23:06.320]  journalist who called him the godfather of the iranian revolution yes jimmy carter is the godfather
[2:23:06.320 --> 2:23:13.120]  of the regime that we're dealing with right now let me give you a few uh very nice quotations
[2:23:13.120 --> 2:23:20.560]  that have been long forgotten in american history unfortunately uh carter's ambassador to the un
[2:23:20.560 --> 2:23:28.160]  andrew young said that chomeini will eventually be hailed as a saint these are policies from 1979
[2:23:29.040 --> 2:23:35.520]  look at what they're saying on one of the worst people in the history of the planet carter's
[2:23:35.520 --> 2:23:42.640]  iranian ambassador william solvents said that chomeini is a gondy like figure these are the
[2:23:42.640 --> 2:23:50.960]  people these are the same people right now who are uh so outraged about president trump doing
[2:23:50.960 --> 2:23:58.560]  the right thing we are here because of them we are in this situation because of them they need
[2:23:58.560 --> 2:24:08.160]  to either support the president or not say anything at all where do you expect this to go
[2:24:08.160 --> 2:24:11.760]  because a lot of people just go oh it's the iranian people and i don't like regime change i
[2:24:11.760 --> 2:24:15.680]  don't like war and i elected trump to deescalate things i think he's trying to get out of the
[2:24:15.680 --> 2:24:20.480]  middle east but solomani has been expanding i don't even realize that the numbers of people
[2:24:20.480 --> 2:24:25.040]  killed by the iranian regime they're very unpopular they they put women in prison that
[2:24:25.040 --> 2:24:29.200]  don't wear hijabs or you know try to have jobs uh that they're not allowed to have they
[2:24:30.080 --> 2:24:35.920]  have killed thousands the last few months mowing them down for protesting the ayatollah so the
[2:24:35.920 --> 2:24:43.600]  left is celebrating the iranian uh dictatorship is bizarre they're in love with every single uh
[2:24:43.600 --> 2:24:51.200]  dictatorship if you remember a very very long time ago when stalin was committing atrocities
[2:24:51.200 --> 2:24:58.480]  and killing millions of people uh the new york times walter doran t was whitewashing his war
[2:24:58.480 --> 2:25:05.760]  crimes what changed nothing changed it's the same exact thing over and over and over again and
[2:25:05.760 --> 2:25:11.280]  they will never learn and never change what i see happening is i think the the killing the
[2:25:11.280 --> 2:25:19.680]  assassination of the beast solomani is a deescalation actually this is actually safer for all of us
[2:25:21.280 --> 2:25:25.920]  i have a question what happens now now that solomani is dead i mean presumably lieutenants
[2:25:25.920 --> 2:25:30.400]  will jockey for powers there are worse guys is there a danger that the various groups that he
[2:25:30.400 --> 2:25:35.440]  organized will splinter and that chaos will increase sometimes the local tough guys better than
[2:25:35.440 --> 2:25:39.600]  chaos i don't know enough yeah how does this deescalate because trump says that and i tend to
[2:25:39.600 --> 2:25:46.400]  agree with him but what's your perspective i think uh that's uh of course there's going to be a reaction
[2:25:46.400 --> 2:25:53.520]  but i refuse to hold president trump responsible for something different terrorist attacks that they
[2:25:53.520 --> 2:25:58.720]  will going to do anyways they have been doing it for 40 years and they're not going to stop
[2:25:58.720 --> 2:26:03.440]  anytime soon well i guess that's my question i mean and not so much with respect to trump i mean
[2:26:03.440 --> 2:26:08.560]  we'll do we'll have an election this year we'll see which way it goes but within within iran itself
[2:26:08.560 --> 2:26:13.360]  who replaces solomani will it be one person will it be two will there be a bloody struggle will the
[2:26:13.360 --> 2:26:17.840]  will there be militias that splinter does this increase the likelihood of chaos what's your
[2:26:17.840 --> 2:26:23.280]  effort take on that yeah i mean i i don't know anything about the region i think the replacement
[2:26:23.280 --> 2:26:29.760]  of solimani uh it's going to be very very very tough because solimani is a monster but he was a
[2:26:29.760 --> 2:26:37.040]  very very intelligent monster and he knew how to also communicate very very well with sunni
[2:26:37.040 --> 2:26:44.880]  militants so the new guy is not someone i'm familiar with at all yet i will be uh but i'm
[2:26:44.880 --> 2:26:52.400]  still not familiar with but i highly doubt that he will be on the same level as solimani
[2:26:52.400 --> 2:26:58.880]  and he's not going to be as charismatic and oh no no he's not he's not and he's not going to have
[2:26:58.880 --> 2:27:04.720]  the same leverage among sunnis solimani has a very long history he was involved with ayatullah
[2:27:04.720 --> 2:27:11.520]  khomeini from 1979 he's got a lot of crimes and bloodshed on his hands they give him a lot of
[2:27:11.520 --> 2:27:16.480]  leverage among islamist sunnis and she is and who is his replacement what do you know about it it's
[2:27:16.480 --> 2:27:24.800]  another general it's basically another yeah but it's still not there's not a lot publicly available
[2:27:24.800 --> 2:27:30.000]  on him so far but he was the adjunct to him and actually fought with him and trained with him so
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:33.680]  it was his right hand man but he's he's very secretive and and a shadowy figure
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:39.280]  ma'am let me ask you this because you're you're really what's interesting to understand what's
[2:27:39.280 --> 2:27:45.680]  happened in the water region and how how there was an overthrow arab spring obama and and really
[2:27:45.680 --> 2:27:51.120]  how that project of the deep state and obama trying to create the arab spring why they did that in
[2:27:51.120 --> 2:27:55.280]  your view what's coming out of that how you see trump's policies actually affecting things
[2:27:56.160 --> 2:28:01.840]  why you do see this as a de-escalation and a pullback but but let me ask you this uh is uh synthia

[2:29:13.680 --> 2:29:18.160]  off the grid the clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on
[2:29:18.160 --> 2:29:22.480]  the east bank of the mississippi because of the flooding we've had to move a lot of our inventory
[2:29:22.480 --> 2:29:26.880]  to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the
[2:29:26.880 --> 2:29:31.920]  system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory so
[2:29:31.920 --> 2:29:37.040]  here's what you should do right now check out the ppx microgrid system at my own power grid dot

[2:30:00.640 --> 2:30:06.720]  in rebooting americana is a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny has really
[2:30:06.720 --> 2:30:12.160]  caught hold not just here in the u.s but worldwide and president trump's fearlessness when it comes
[2:30:12.160 --> 2:30:18.720]  to promoting americana and basic liberty is amazing as well he's still lacking on the big tech
[2:30:18.720 --> 2:30:23.920]  censorship taking action against that in some other areas but trying to end the wars boosting our
[2:30:23.920 --> 2:30:29.280]  economy speaking out against kindness china trump's been doing an amazing job but now more than ever
[2:30:30.000 --> 2:30:36.000]  we really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective and the globalist are
[2:30:36.000 --> 2:30:41.360]  beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way and so we're going to see some major
[2:30:41.360 --> 2:30:47.280]  fireworks out of them but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison
[2:30:47.280 --> 2:30:52.960]  they spray at us that's an attempt to demoralize us we've got to remember that and stay focused and
[2:30:52.960 --> 2:31:01.760]  stay happy i keep my eye on the news all the time but i miss the fact that in late 2019 just about
[2:31:01.760 --> 2:31:12.640]  two weeks ago the cdc and the fda approved live ebola vaccine to be given inside the united states
[2:31:12.640 --> 2:31:20.480]  and it is an experimental vaccine it is live it's not even attenuated they've just genetically
[2:31:20.480 --> 2:31:26.720]  modified it so it's supposedly not lethal same stuff they did with the Gardasil vaccine that's
[2:31:26.720 --> 2:31:33.040]  admittedly killed and made so many this is just crazy and the congos had the biggest outbreaks
[2:31:33.040 --> 2:31:38.560]  of ebola ever since they started giving the vaccine there in the last few years oh and of course
[2:31:38.560 --> 2:31:44.160]  opening the borders up here and letting people in unfettered the democrats distribute across the
[2:31:44.160 --> 2:31:51.120]  country you cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity and it is an attempted ebola assault on
[2:31:51.120 --> 2:31:57.440]  america this is the new world order if you understand why the globalist why the servants
[2:31:57.440 --> 2:32:05.280]  of satan hate info wars it's because we're awake we're alive we're passionate and we're not giving
[2:32:05.280 --> 2:32:10.480]  up that's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the new world order's plans
[2:32:11.040 --> 2:32:16.240]  to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us that's what
[2:32:16.240 --> 2:32:21.920]  we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags the globalists have literally sold
[2:32:21.920 --> 2:32:26.720]  their souls to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves because they are
[2:32:26.720 --> 2:32:33.440]  eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent it is up to us who are
[2:32:33.440 --> 2:32:40.880]  awake not the sheep and not the wolves but the sheep dogs to stand firm and resist these wicked
[2:32:40.880 --> 2:32:47.680]  tyrants they fear the fact that we are awake they fear the fact that we are alive they fear the
[2:32:47.680 --> 2:32:53.600]  fact that we love god and that's all we ever have to know is that god is in charge
[2:32:53.600 --> 2:33:09.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:09.520 --> 2:33:17.520]  you
[2:33:20.480 --> 2:33:28.480]  false john is a book that warm paddus who is a prestigious legal mind that's not really contested
[2:33:28.480 --> 2:33:33.600]  is currently reading so he was excited to hear about synthia for hot coming on because the
[2:33:33.600 --> 2:33:40.000]  arab spring was a big deal openly financed by obama and google and facebook to overthrow
[2:33:40.560 --> 2:33:48.240]  pro-western vastly more democrat regimes in many cases and and then put in the muslim brotherhood
[2:33:48.240 --> 2:33:54.240]  that is just the commanders al qaeda uh and so synthia if you could just recap and they give
[2:33:54.240 --> 2:33:59.440]  it anything you want but what you experienced the arab spring the the numbers of deaths hundreds of
[2:33:59.440 --> 2:34:04.240]  churches blown up the egyptian military being slaughtered even after the muslim brotherhood
[2:34:04.240 --> 2:34:09.360]  had control they wanted to get rid of the officer class i mean i just and how you got
[2:34:09.360 --> 2:34:13.760]  imprisoned and they wanted you to shut up i mean your story is incredible and then it
[2:34:13.760 --> 2:34:18.960]  obviously plugs into what's happening today and that linds you look through is one of the top
[2:34:18.960 --> 2:34:24.400]  journalists in egypt uh and you're now here in the us and and and how you see trump now
[2:34:24.400 --> 2:34:31.040]  compared to obama please you've got the floor oh there's no comparison i actually didn't go to
[2:34:31.040 --> 2:34:36.160]  prison i escaped my assassination attempt i was going from memory because you're all here did you
[2:34:36.160 --> 2:34:43.760]  get arrested and grabbed they tried to make you not say things uh no they they abducted my brother
[2:34:43.760 --> 2:34:49.680]  and that's right try to yeah they they took my brother not me and i just remember they grabbed
[2:34:49.680 --> 2:34:56.080]  somebody tried to make you it was in the news they did that yes and i apologize my memory fails
[2:34:56.080 --> 2:35:00.720]  so they they they abducted your brother to get you to stop them what you did yeah go ahead yes
[2:35:00.720 --> 2:35:07.360]  yes to get me uh right after the protests uh broke they uh they wanted me to meet with the
[2:35:07.360 --> 2:35:15.600]  the prime minister ahmet shafiq and uh i said no because uh the protesters did not elect me to
[2:35:15.600 --> 2:35:23.280]  represent them uh so unlike the egyptian government i do not uh i'm not going to hijack a movement
[2:35:23.280 --> 2:35:29.600]  that i had nothing to do with so i refused to meet the prime minister they abducted my brother
[2:35:30.400 --> 2:35:38.640]  the next day and i was calling him and the phone opened i could hear him could hear the
[2:35:38.640 --> 2:35:46.560]  mubarak's regime uh torturing him i could hear him scream on the other side and after the phone
[2:35:46.560 --> 2:35:52.800]  cut off someone from uh the regime called me and said you're going to meet with ahmet shafiq now
[2:35:52.800 --> 2:35:59.760]  and your brother will go back home and i still refuse to compromise because i knew that if i
[2:35:59.760 --> 2:36:10.720]  showed any weakness or any fear my brother would get killed because you can't show an iota of fear
[2:36:10.720 --> 2:36:16.400]  to these savages who would do something like that to a human being who would abduct and torture
[2:36:16.400 --> 2:36:22.400]  and kill and rape an innocent person so they tried to do this but everything guys it started
[2:36:22.400 --> 2:36:29.440]  with 9 11 after 9 11 i decided that if i'm not part of the solution i'm part of the terrorist
[2:36:29.440 --> 2:36:37.280]  problem and the ideas that are flying into america's buildings and then i studied islamic theology
[2:36:37.280 --> 2:36:45.760]  exactly like a mufti would study it i studied it for 12 years every single day to be able to be in
[2:36:45.760 --> 2:36:54.160]  their heads to predict their crimes before they attempt it and that and of course i established
[2:36:54.160 --> 2:37:00.640]  also a classic liberal political party that were for separation of moscow and state and
[2:37:01.200 --> 2:37:07.920]  mubarak's regime didn't like it of course and the so-called arab spring started and by the way
[2:37:07.920 --> 2:37:16.320]  the day president obama was elected i told my mother that our life in egypt was over i told her i
[2:37:16.320 --> 2:37:24.800]  will either get slaughtered i will go to prison or i will uh get uh or i would have to be the country
[2:37:24.800 --> 2:37:32.560]  and it was true they tried to assassinate me on october 9 2011 when i was going to protest
[2:37:32.560 --> 2:37:38.800]  for religious freedom with a friend of mine unfortunately uh my friend went without me
[2:37:38.800 --> 2:37:47.680]  because i had a fever and he was tortured and killed in front of tv cameras by the military
[2:37:48.800 --> 2:37:56.080]  and when i escaped the assassination attempt someone called me and said from egyptian intelligence
[2:37:56.080 --> 2:38:02.400]  you escaped this time but we are still going to get you and that's when i took a plane and came to
[2:38:02.400 --> 2:38:09.680]  the united states wow wow so it was it was your brother grabbed and your and your uh uh colleagues
[2:38:09.680 --> 2:38:15.360]  that were killed i mean just unbelievable and you still didn't back down you still didn't do what
[2:38:15.360 --> 2:38:21.760]  they wanted you to do which what what man in in the media today uh wouldn't roll over uh to that
[2:38:21.760 --> 2:38:26.080]  so i want you to get into your perspective now of where you see things going with trump trying to
[2:38:26.080 --> 2:38:29.280]  pull out of the middle east but but norm patis had a question yeah i mean mind i'm this i'm
[2:38:29.280 --> 2:38:33.280]  meaning it for the first time is fair it's a very moving story please tell me what happened to your
[2:38:33.280 --> 2:38:39.840]  brother is he all right now he's fine uh they uh destroyed his upper jaw he had to have three
[2:38:39.840 --> 2:38:46.880]  surgeries and a metal gel but uh he's fine and he's a very very brave man well that's are you a
[2:38:46.880 --> 2:38:51.600]  brave woman i've heard stories in recent years at various seminars about the violence toward
[2:38:51.600 --> 2:38:55.840]  journalists families this is not at all uncommon right now they have a loved one kidnapped and the
[2:38:55.840 --> 2:39:00.800]  journalist effectively held hostage um that way i applaud both you and your brother for
[2:39:00.800 --> 2:39:06.880]  your courageous behavior thank you thank you sir well all people to really know what's going on
[2:39:06.880 --> 2:39:12.880]  over there and and who obama's backing because i mean this happened correct after obama had
[2:39:12.880 --> 2:39:18.960]  launched the air of spring yes and and and there's something that very few people know i
[2:39:18.960 --> 2:39:24.960]  you know i went on wikileaks uh because i was curious i wanted to see what was in there about
[2:39:24.960 --> 2:39:31.280]  the so-called air spring and guess what uh the massacre where i was supposed to get executed on
[2:39:31.280 --> 2:39:40.080]  october 9 2011 uh the hillary clinton uh was aware of it was aware that it was going to happen was
[2:39:40.080 --> 2:39:49.440]  aware after it happened and there was discussions about it that so casually and so irresponsibly
[2:39:49.440 --> 2:39:58.320]  talking that nobody cares and the strategy to round uh to to round christians and by and and
[2:39:58.320 --> 2:40:03.840]  the islamists will start to kill them and they have a deal with the military to not intervene to
[2:40:03.840 --> 2:40:09.040]  try to save their lives and hillary clinton was aware of this and she still backed the muslim
[2:40:09.040 --> 2:40:14.720]  brotherhood the obama regime because that's a regime not an administration was aware of this
[2:40:14.720 --> 2:40:20.720]  and they still blamed cops after they were slaughtered on that day president obama came out
[2:40:20.720 --> 2:40:27.200]  and said i urge all both sides to restrain themselves who the people that were shot execution
[2:40:27.200 --> 2:40:32.240]  style that were run over by military people let me ask you this why do you think obama and hillary
[2:40:32.240 --> 2:40:35.600]  it's all come out in wikileaks but hell they were bragging on cnn saying oh it's great they've
[2:40:35.600 --> 2:40:40.880]  overthrown the egyptian government these are good people knowing that it was people far far worse
[2:40:40.880 --> 2:40:46.800]  al qaeda isis muslim brotherhood and that then exported that into libya exported it into syria
[2:40:46.800 --> 2:40:51.440]  and now the civil war we've seen since then why in the world with hillary and and the deep state
[2:40:51.440 --> 2:40:54.720]  wanted to stabilize the middle east because they admit as you said in the wikileaks that's the
[2:40:54.720 --> 2:41:02.320]  plan that is such a war crime uh i think uh president obama did it for ideological reasons
[2:41:03.040 --> 2:41:07.600]  everything he has done from the minute he woke up till the minute he went to sleep was against
[2:41:07.600 --> 2:41:16.240]  america was anti-american his speech uh in 2009 in cairo was atrocious and it endangered every
[2:41:16.240 --> 2:41:22.000]  single christian and jew any azidie an atheist in the middle east it was one of the most dangerous
[2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:29.600]  speeches in history we knew after that that this was his signal to islamists to basically
[2:41:30.160 --> 2:41:37.040]  slaughter us and we were right i told that i told my mom this was going to happen and sadly i was
[2:41:37.040 --> 2:41:42.480]  right so from your perspective what's the best and wisest course for america to take in the middle
[2:41:42.480 --> 2:41:46.560]  east you know i in the tim cookbook which or the the cookbook which i've just read i don't know if
[2:41:46.560 --> 2:41:51.520]  you've seen it false dawn you know he suggests that we were crashingly naive in the expectations of
[2:41:51.520 --> 2:41:57.120]  the urb spring um and that our inter officious intermentaling or our goodwill um has you know
[2:41:57.120 --> 2:42:02.480]  if that's what it was um has done nothing but produce consequences that we can't control what's
[2:42:02.480 --> 2:42:07.760]  the wise what what should we be doing as a country in the middle east or if anything well we've done
[2:42:07.760 --> 2:42:16.880]  before the founding fathers had the same exact challenges and they fought it moderately like
[2:42:16.880 --> 2:42:22.400]  i'll give you an example uh the the assassination of sulaiman you reminded me of a little little bit
[2:42:22.400 --> 2:42:30.320]  of this one of my favorite uh people in american history is steven decatur i have his picture on my
[2:42:30.320 --> 2:42:38.000]  wall um and steven decatur was american uh naval hero and sit the apart we got to go to break come
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:42.240]  back i want to hear about this and i'll be able to remember what obama said in kairu and then what
[2:42:42.240 --> 2:42:48.800]  he did turning loose the muslim brotherhood al qaeda worldwide and and it was done on purpose

[2:47:04.240 --> 2:47:26.000]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones it's great to have a live tv radio
[2:47:26.000 --> 2:47:29.760]  show that reaches millions of people conservatively a day it's all because the listeners keep spreading
[2:47:29.760 --> 2:47:35.440]  the word that gets past the censors but one of my biggest frustrations is there's so much huge
[2:47:35.440 --> 2:47:41.040]  breaking news and so much what we're covering is so important that i knew about this this morning
[2:47:41.040 --> 2:47:48.800]  before the show i saw the documents the clips everything and then i just did two hours and
[2:47:48.800 --> 2:47:54.560]  47 minutes of live media and didn't tell people oh i'm going to go live a little bit in the fourth
[2:47:54.560 --> 2:48:02.480]  hour and then dr nick megas takes over to break what was given to us by vaccine damage researchers
[2:48:03.680 --> 2:48:11.680]  that is smoking gun stuff so rob do is going to be joining me and for that segment from six
[2:48:11.680 --> 2:48:23.680]  after to 15 after coming up next hour where the head un scientist says vaccines are totally
[2:48:23.680 --> 2:48:28.320]  safe and effective and then she's caught on internal video in a board meeting saying
[2:48:29.520 --> 2:48:33.360]  we don't have the data in fact this could be hurting people in fact before i forget print me
[2:48:33.360 --> 2:48:39.680]  the this article from 2020 did an abc report back in 2002 but you'll find it online
[2:48:41.360 --> 2:48:46.960]  or just cdc had covered up autism brain damage risk and it's the head of the cdc in a meeting
[2:48:46.960 --> 2:48:51.040]  and the minutes came out in a lawsuit saying my god we brain damage millions we got to cover this up
[2:48:51.040 --> 2:48:56.000]  so again i'm not against vaccines themselves as a technology it's that the liability protection
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:49:00.960]  what the companies are doing is the big problem my grandmother got polio polio vaccine they told
[2:49:00.960 --> 2:49:07.360]  her that okay so we'll we'll get to that next hour norm patis riding shotgun uh you had a question
[2:49:07.360 --> 2:49:12.960]  for our guest here uh because you've been going to seminars about law you were just at one about
[2:49:12.960 --> 2:49:17.760]  free speech the middle east now you're you're i mean you're a you're a bookworm you're a smart guy
[2:49:17.760 --> 2:49:23.280]  norm patis and we've got synthia her hot one of the most famous journalist over there whose brother
[2:49:23.280 --> 2:49:28.080]  got kidnapped and tortured and put in jail and her her her colleagues who tortured killed
[2:49:29.600 --> 2:49:33.760]  saying we're going to do this to you if you don't recant and and work for us well she didn't

[2:49:38.480 --> 2:49:42.400]  i'm ashamed to say i don't remember the name you may know it he says barrister in london a young
[2:49:42.400 --> 2:49:47.280]  woman in her 40s um who's represented a number of middle east journalists whose families have
[2:49:47.280 --> 2:49:53.920]  been abducted while the journalists were in great britain um and they are held um um often in
[2:49:53.920 --> 2:49:58.720]  circumstance as much as your brother was some of them have been killed and and apparent i was i was
[2:49:58.720 --> 2:50:02.240]  totally amazed somehow i had i'd missed this because our media doesn't make a big deal about this
[2:50:02.240 --> 2:50:06.480]  because usually there's people working for obama no apparently not i mean how how how common a
[2:50:06.480 --> 2:50:11.120]  problem is this how many of your colleagues have been have been similarly paralyzed synthia
[2:50:11.120 --> 2:50:19.040]  count i i i lost count of how many people were imprisoned and tortured and abducted and raped
[2:50:19.040 --> 2:50:25.520]  and thrown in the desert blindfolded thrown in the river and thrown in denial how have you

[2:50:40.640 --> 2:50:49.520]  happy in america uh i stayed alive because i know how they think and i knew how to always be one step
[2:50:49.520 --> 2:50:55.920]  ahead of them i knew how to have leverage when i didn't have any what was the assassination
[2:50:55.920 --> 2:50:59.600]  attempt oh did you know it was coming what happened it came out what you like that she was
[2:50:59.600 --> 2:51:04.480]  going to go to this public event where they did kill about people she didn't go wow i'm sorry i'm
[2:51:04.480 --> 2:51:12.720]  going to get killed the person i was going with got killed execution style uh after he was run over
[2:51:12.720 --> 2:51:18.640]  by military vehicle and the same day someone from egyptian intelligence said we missed you today but
[2:51:18.640 --> 2:51:24.160]  we are going to get you and although i've been getting 10 to 50 death threats a day for a decade
[2:51:24.160 --> 2:51:29.760]  and i was under surveillance i knew that this time was they were serious because they did it to
[2:51:29.760 --> 2:51:37.200]  michael so they could do it to me um and that's when i really truly believed that they were serious
[2:51:37.760 --> 2:51:42.800]  now cynthia cynthia i want to go back to this and i want you to a year's too long or two years is too
[2:51:42.800 --> 2:51:50.640]  long about a year and a half ago you were last time with us almost a year almost almost a year so
[2:51:51.680 --> 2:51:57.200]  you're really an expert on someone that's read the quran that's read the different books that go
[2:51:57.200 --> 2:52:01.840]  along with it and that really knows what's going on we should have you back on just to get into that
[2:52:01.840 --> 2:52:07.040]  research and and we're uh orthodox islam's going uh but just in summation because i want people to
[2:52:07.040 --> 2:52:10.880]  really know what you've personally gone through to get a snapshot of this what's really going on with
[2:52:10.880 --> 2:52:15.360]  islam what do you think the average viewer and listeners should know about what's happening in
[2:52:15.360 --> 2:52:21.440]  europe what's happening in the middle east so there's some pretty good news which is uh very
[2:52:21.440 --> 2:52:28.800]  unusual coming out of the middle east i personally did not see that coming at all i was if someone
[2:52:28.800 --> 2:52:35.200]  had told me uh a decade ago that i will be seeing what i'm witnessing right now happening in the
[2:52:35.200 --> 2:52:41.440]  middle east i would have thought that they were deranged or high or something but i would have
[2:52:41.440 --> 2:52:47.360]  never believed it in a million years but i'm seeing it with my own eyes there's a huge reformist
[2:52:47.360 --> 2:52:53.360]  movement going on right now for separation of moscow and state and we have very powerful
[2:52:53.360 --> 2:53:00.960]  politicians on our side um president cc his administration has tons of problems and he
[2:53:00.960 --> 2:53:06.800]  still has a lot of the bureaucracy and the deep state and very similar problems that
[2:53:06.800 --> 2:53:15.120]  president trump is dealing with but he is 100 on the side of reformers and he is absolutely
[2:53:15.120 --> 2:53:24.000]  not not shy about it i published an article uh that shows historic uh unprecedented things
[2:53:24.000 --> 2:53:29.920]  that president cc did uh i published it in the middle east quarterly you could find it on my
[2:53:29.920 --> 2:53:35.280]  website and you could find it on the middle east forums website and i did not see that coming at
[2:53:35.280 --> 2:53:40.880]  all i was very skeptical when cc came to power and i wrote articles against him and i had every
[2:53:40.880 --> 2:53:46.720]  right to be skeptical because he came out of military intelligence so i thought he was just
[2:53:46.720 --> 2:53:53.200]  going to be more of the same until he started to do the exact opposite of what i thought he would do
[2:53:53.200 --> 2:53:57.680]  can i ask you this question i mean trump says and when i heard the military intelligence people they
[2:53:57.680 --> 2:54:02.400]  say he's trying this and and and some of the policy wonks he really is trying to have a pragmatic
[2:54:02.400 --> 2:54:07.840]  thing of no destabilization no stirring up shunies and she hides for control just so we can have
[2:54:07.840 --> 2:54:12.320]  weapons sales in the area or or or just so we can uh you know have no big contractors then he's
[2:54:12.320 --> 2:54:16.320]  really trying to kill the agenda that's been going on for multiple generations to stir the
[2:54:16.320 --> 2:54:22.560]  middle east up and he stabilized it are you as a real scholar uh thinking that you're seeing
[2:54:22.560 --> 2:54:27.120]  some of what trump's doing telegraphing that's the middle east and then bolstering even people
[2:54:27.120 --> 2:54:33.280]  you thought would be bad or now getting with the program uh you would not expect that but
[2:54:33.280 --> 2:54:39.360]  actually president trump is quite popular among uh moderate muslims in the middle east
[2:54:39.360 --> 2:54:47.120]  he is very very popular among moderate muslims because they see that he communicates uh to their
[2:54:48.320 --> 2:54:54.560]  understanding that he does not put up with radical islamic agenda he is not shy to speak
[2:54:54.560 --> 2:54:59.760]  his mind against these radical islam is not popular it's just that they're in power and
[2:54:59.760 --> 2:55:05.120]  everyone's scared so trump's helping people in the middle east have courage is what you're saying
[2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:12.000]  absolutely like just like the iranians are happy most of the iran is 90 percent i would dare say
[2:55:12.000 --> 2:55:17.840]  of the iranians are happy that the monster soley mani is dead uh the united states of america
[2:55:17.840 --> 2:55:24.080]  fought against islamic terrorism before during the barberry wars which you call barberry wars
[2:55:24.080 --> 2:55:32.640]  in our history they're called jihadist expeditions against the infidels so uh the barberry wars
[2:55:32.640 --> 2:55:40.080]  look how they were fought there's something that i always always say because this should be the slogan
[2:55:40.080 --> 2:55:43.920]  for sitha can we do this because because i was all over the map saying you did a great powerful
[2:55:43.920 --> 2:55:47.440]  interview in normals here in s break questions will you come back next week for an hour and get

[2:56:02.400 --> 2:56:07.920]  leathernecks the marines propose a broader project for you synthia and that is teach people like me
[2:56:07.920 --> 2:56:12.880]  ordinary americans who've acquired its midget of islamophobia and have to feel ashamed when they
[2:56:12.880 --> 2:56:18.960]  meet a muslim person handshake a handshake and realize they're the same teaches how to co-exist
[2:56:18.960 --> 2:56:24.640]  and teach us more about the separation of moscow and state how can we have a reformation for
[2:56:24.640 --> 2:56:28.480]  islam would you come on and talk about that and how can we have a reformation in american attitudes
[2:56:28.480 --> 2:56:32.240]  to get it right because it's one planet we got to find a way to live together or we're gonna die
[2:56:32.240 --> 2:56:37.680]  again is that a good idea synthia that sounds fantastic and i'm writing a book right now which

[2:56:50.320 --> 2:56:54.160]  having me thank you yeah the last time she's been on she's gone a couple times and i've seen her on
[2:56:54.160 --> 2:56:57.360]  other shows i mean she's she's just incredible historian that's why i want to start getting her
[2:56:57.360 --> 2:57:02.560]  on more but then i'm talking about her story it's so wild yeah i didn't mean to divert things i i i
[2:57:02.560 --> 2:57:06.560]  never met her before and i was like amazing you kicked ass and that and when it's all about
[2:57:06.560 --> 2:57:10.400]  is getting these really interesting guests on the live a lot yeah no kidding she's really famous
[2:57:10.400 --> 2:57:13.600]  the middle east what's funny when i went i said tending that seminar and hearing about how these
[2:57:13.600 --> 2:57:17.840]  family members are getting abducted i'm like really and then here she is here's one of them well
[2:57:17.840 --> 2:57:21.200]  this is why that you can't have freedom over there as the radicals are in control but if we show
[2:57:21.200 --> 2:57:26.320]  strength against that these folks want oh yeah i'm all on that they want freedom and that doesn't mean
[2:57:26.320 --> 2:57:29.680]  teaching five-year-olds how to cut their genitals off you know and there's some of that radical
[2:57:29.680 --> 2:57:34.720]  Islam we need that conservatism uh compared to the left i think some of the radical islamists are
[2:57:34.720 --> 2:57:38.960]  the lesser of evils but let's finish up with five minutes and i've got the huge u n news and the
[2:57:38.960 --> 2:57:44.800]  nutter nick baggage but believe me this u n vaccine news is huge i want to talk about super
[2:57:44.800 --> 2:57:49.520]  silver whitening toothpaste because i hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half and
[2:57:50.400 --> 2:57:54.320]  i told alex i said man this is the best toothpaste i've ever tried he's like well what are you doing
[2:57:54.320 --> 2:57:58.480]  just sitting in here telling me you got to get up there and tell people and oh so here i am telling
[2:57:58.480 --> 2:58:05.360]  people super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste i've ever tried and i'm 45
[2:58:05.360 --> 2:58:10.160]  years old and i've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free i think the
[2:58:10.160 --> 2:58:14.560]  big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after i brush my teeth
[2:58:14.560 --> 2:58:19.920]  with this they feel so clean and the toothpaste that i don't even like rinse out my mouth after i
[2:58:19.920 --> 2:58:25.920]  brush my teeth with this it feels so good it feels like it feels like good things are happening in
[2:58:25.920 --> 2:58:31.920]  my mouth in fact i find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice
[2:58:31.920 --> 2:58:42.320]  a day now because i like the way it feels
[2:58:44.720 --> 2:58:49.360]  i would thank you for everything you've done for the info war but i know you're like me you don't
[2:58:49.360 --> 2:58:54.720]  want my thanks you want victory over the globalist and these devil worship and child molesters and
[2:58:54.720 --> 2:58:58.960]  you want them off your back and off your children's back and you know what i'm the same way and that's
[2:58:58.960 --> 2:59:04.080]  why we're on the same damn team and it's why info wars has been delivering time and time again
[2:59:04.720 --> 2:59:11.120]  when it's clutch time to focus the people on taking action against the globalist because i'm
[2:59:11.120 --> 2:59:18.240]  committed to a future for humanity and i know you are as well so thank you in 2019 for standing
[2:59:18.240 --> 2:59:22.240]  with us because you are the info war and i want to thank you for committing to stand with us in
[2:59:22.240 --> 2:59:27.840]  2020 however you can for the bottom of my heart from my family and from the great crew at info wars
[2:59:27.840 --> 2:59:32.320]  i want to thank you all because you are the info war and you know that's not just words that's
[2:59:32.320 --> 2:59:41.040]  reality you have made history we have made history together info wars dot com only has power because
[2:59:41.040 --> 3:00:00.880]  of you and i suggest you use it you're listening to the alex jones show it's like norm patis
[3:00:00.880 --> 3:00:06.960]  famous constitutional lawyers reading my mind because i wanted to ask him weeks ago during the
[3:00:06.960 --> 3:00:14.080]  whole impeachment fiasco to come on and he was busy with cases and couldn't that time about impeachment
[3:00:15.040 --> 3:00:21.280]  and about as a constitutional lawyer practices federal and uh state what what is it like to watch
[3:00:22.000 --> 3:00:27.040]  what they did would do process and was jonathan turnley who's a liberal professor right when he
[3:00:27.040 --> 3:00:31.200]  says what was impeachable is how the democrats have conducted this and i don't even have a trial in
[3:00:31.200 --> 3:00:37.360]  the senate now when the when the fruit of the tree is from a poison tree or uh we've got four
[3:00:37.360 --> 3:00:44.240]  minutes left what is your expert view on this what i call a fiasco it is a fiasco i mean i think
[3:00:44.240 --> 3:00:47.920]  that the thing that's been frustrating to me watching the coverage is this is not a traditional
[3:00:47.920 --> 3:00:52.880]  legal proceeding and thus the rules of evidence and the rules of criminal and or civil procedure
[3:00:52.880 --> 3:00:57.920]  don't apply but what we're tinkering with is the soul of the nation and how we govern ourselves
[3:00:57.920 --> 3:01:02.320]  and where there's an attack on the highest office in the land now as i understand the case in the
[3:01:02.320 --> 3:01:06.640]  past they would try to follow impeachments according to parliamentary rules right and they'd have
[3:01:06.640 --> 3:01:12.240]  rules but i mean but what we have here you know is a failure to communicate to quote uh to quote
[3:01:12.240 --> 3:01:18.400]  cool hand loop what nobody has persuaded me that anything involving ukraine really affects national
[3:01:18.400 --> 3:01:24.720]  security and nancy polosi called her own bluff um she's the one that should be impeached this is
[3:01:24.720 --> 3:01:29.280]  an urgent matter of national security we've got to rush through the proceedings in order to get
[3:01:29.280 --> 3:01:34.160]  this done because presumably we're at risk and then we and and then oh by the way i'm not going to
[3:01:34.160 --> 3:01:38.080]  send the articles over because i don't like the way the trial is going to look i thought we were
[3:01:38.080 --> 3:01:43.200]  at risk and this had to get done because washington was burning now the other thing that seemed to
[3:01:43.200 --> 3:01:48.720]  get lost is okay trump asked for whatever he asked for from the ukraine investigation of
[3:01:48.720 --> 3:01:54.960]  biden i still want to know as an american citizen how joe biden's 30-something-year-old kid got a
[3:01:54.960 --> 3:02:00.640]  $50,000 a month do nothing job on a ukrainian board if he didn't get it because papa pulled the
[3:02:00.640 --> 3:02:05.600]  strings i don't have hair down my shoulders so from my perspective that's an unanswered question
[3:02:05.600 --> 3:02:10.480]  the republicans have missed the opportunity to focus on bread and butter nancy polosi's claim
[3:02:10.480 --> 3:02:17.360]  that some and the case has not been made to me um that whatever manipulation was done with respect
[3:02:17.360 --> 3:02:23.520]  to the aid was of such vital national security interest that we need to unseat the highest
[3:02:23.520 --> 3:02:28.800]  elected official on the land the case has not been made so and and when nancy doesn't send it
[3:02:28.800 --> 3:02:33.360]  when and polosi doesn't send it to the senate i think the you know i heard an interesting
[3:02:33.360 --> 3:02:37.760]  suggestion the other day one senator thought of moving to dismiss on the on the theory that the
[3:02:37.760 --> 3:02:42.480]  house hadn't diligently prosecuted i think that's a viable option at this point it's a political
[3:02:42.480 --> 3:02:46.880]  stunt as far as i'm concerned she's holding on to the yeah you shouldn't even dignify it with
[3:02:46.880 --> 3:02:50.960]  the trial i know trump likes it because he thinks it'll you know let him show other frauds but i mean
[3:02:50.960 --> 3:02:54.640]  if you start dignifying total frauds i think you because they're talking about having new
[3:02:54.640 --> 3:02:58.960]  impeachments and new articles and it's just it'll go on and on they'll churn it until the election
[3:02:58.960 --> 3:03:03.760]  and i think the impeachment process becomes publicly funded democratic campaign fodder
[3:03:03.760 --> 3:03:08.320]  um that's why she's sitting on the indictment so to speak for the or the impeachment process
[3:03:08.320 --> 3:03:13.280]  because the timing isn't right um but once the primaries began and it the democratic
[3:03:13.280 --> 3:03:18.000]  uh field shakes itself out a little bit more i think those articles will go over and then
[3:03:18.560 --> 3:03:24.720]  we will be paying we the people will be paying the senate um to produce democratic talking points
[3:03:24.720 --> 3:03:28.640]  as part of the 2020 election i think most people are sure smart enough to well senator graham says
[3:03:28.640 --> 3:03:33.760]  they might get it going sometime next week but uh who knows it's just unprecedented as you said
[3:03:33.760 --> 3:03:38.720]  to hold the country potions like this and i think it really hurt them bad uh you know just because
[3:03:38.720 --> 3:03:43.440]  14 percent of americans in a major poll think brown cows produce chocolate milk uh doesn't
[3:03:43.440 --> 3:03:47.040]  mean the rest of us don't see through how dangerous this is i still want to find that
[3:03:47.040 --> 3:03:52.800]  cow for the strawberry milk you know they have um orange julians yeah and what orange cows
[3:03:52.800 --> 3:03:56.640]  some great orange milk i've missed those i've been traveling a little bit lately but i've missed the
[3:03:56.640 --> 3:04:02.800]  orange cows well um in the minute we have left um it's still in the supreme court of connecticut
[3:04:02.800 --> 3:04:07.840]  and and and the left's all excited oh we've got alex shones his court his cases in the supreme
[3:04:07.840 --> 3:04:13.040]  court he's been found guilty of the sandy hook stuff no no it's it's a special appeal because of what
[3:04:13.040 --> 3:04:18.480]  was going on before anything ever got going the appeal was that the court took a video
[3:04:18.480 --> 3:04:23.920]  violated your first amendment rights by penalizing you for um for speaking out on this show that's
[3:04:23.920 --> 3:04:29.120]  what the appeal is and the question is um could you be punished for vigorous expression our answer
[3:04:29.120 --> 3:04:33.440]  is no if the connecticut supreme court says you can we'll go to the u.s supreme court to see what
[3:04:33.440 --> 3:04:40.480]  they think and again it's just unprecedented what's happening norm paddice thank you so much for
[3:04:40.480 --> 3:04:44.640]  joining us we appreciate it thank you a great job today all right the huge i mean this is
[3:04:44.640 --> 3:04:47.600]  lifesaving critical information on the other side
[3:04:52.720 --> 3:04:58.560]  info or store dot com we have a new product and we got several thousand of these in and they're
[3:04:58.560 --> 3:05:02.240]  going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them want to thank the listeners for
[3:05:02.240 --> 3:05:08.720]  getting it but this really is a game-changing toothpaste and it doesn't compete with super
[3:05:08.720 --> 3:05:14.160]  blue that's four to five a colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride free the adult or the children's
[3:05:14.160 --> 3:05:18.960]  these are both excellent toothpaste concentrates that don't have fillers people love it this is
[3:05:18.960 --> 3:05:25.040]  a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans but also
[3:05:25.040 --> 3:05:31.920]  re mineralizes the teeth then it has the patented silver salt silver in it to knock out the bacteria
[3:05:31.920 --> 3:05:36.320]  that causes ginger virus this is all proven you can make claims with this but i have to tell you
[3:05:36.320 --> 3:05:42.720]  no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria the viruses and cleaning the
[3:05:42.720 --> 3:05:48.320]  teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel so we're really proud of it it funds the
[3:05:48.320 --> 3:05:52.880]  operation info or store dot com that's why we're still on air thanks to you i don't want to run
[3:05:52.880 --> 3:05:57.200]  up and i'm leaving you've been doing great oh and you're going to finish up with these calls

[3:06:07.120 --> 3:06:11.520]  covers continues everybody spread those links the globes are hacking us trying to shut this down
[3:06:11.520 --> 3:06:15.520]  don't let them win no bs doesn't tell you everything's straight shooting here see i don't have some
[3:06:15.520 --> 3:06:23.680]  mackey value manipulative view with me it's all straightforward attack that's the real power you
[3:06:23.680 --> 3:06:31.360]  have to do every single thing i say or we will not make it understand do you understand come with me
[3:06:31.360 --> 3:06:44.240]  if you want to live come with me if you want to live ladies and gentlemen we are live on this
[3:06:44.240 --> 3:06:50.800]  friday worldwide broadcast and we've got the info wars nightly news and news director rob do here with
[3:06:50.800 --> 3:06:57.120]  us in studio he was showing me this information this morning that was sent to us by some of the
[3:06:57.120 --> 3:07:03.920]  researchers out there and it just blew me away and so we're going to do a detailed report on this
[3:07:03.920 --> 3:07:10.320]  that should be done by next monday or tuesday but i wanted to go ahead and just give some background
[3:07:10.320 --> 3:07:18.000]  here and then get to this with rob because this is the world health organization chief scientist
[3:07:18.960 --> 3:07:25.520]  caught lying to the public and so he'll go over some of this but here she is in an internal video
[3:07:25.520 --> 3:07:32.080]  that they didn't want released this is leaked right now here and she's she's saying we haven't tested
[3:07:32.080 --> 3:07:36.400]  these we don't know if what people are saying is true that it's killing people well that's because
[3:07:36.400 --> 3:07:41.040]  there's liability protection here in the us and in other countries they get the same loss past
[3:07:41.040 --> 3:07:45.440]  where you can't know what's in them and you can't know what they're contaminated with and if somebody
[3:07:45.440 --> 3:07:51.680]  gets hurt they secretly go to a secret court and then maybe get paid off so safe and effective that's
[3:07:51.680 --> 3:07:55.760]  that's a lie now they're trying to pass laws to take the inserts out where it admits it can hurt
[3:07:55.760 --> 3:08:00.800]  you or kill you they always misrepresent and say we're against the technology of vaccines no
[3:08:00.800 --> 3:08:06.000]  they have liability protection big corrupt big pharma all the history of their problems what
[3:08:06.000 --> 3:08:12.480]  drug companies should be exempt from liability for any of its products this is madness now they
[3:08:12.480 --> 3:08:17.680]  have thousands of vaccines in development over 500 approved in different parts of the world
[3:08:17.680 --> 3:08:22.400]  they're trying to make you take more and more of this companies are going to make you pay for
[3:08:22.400 --> 3:08:28.000]  something in many cases that's experimental because the governor says he thinks it's an emergency
[3:08:28.000 --> 3:08:36.240]  like Gardasil supposedly going to stop the warts that certain viruses cause the wart is cancer
[3:08:36.240 --> 3:08:40.640]  folks and then it kills a bunch of people but it's okay because they had liability protection
[3:08:40.640 --> 3:08:46.320]  they go and get a president or a governor under us law to say this is an emergency take it gives
[3:08:46.320 --> 3:08:50.560]  it liability protection and it's added to that list and then they can dump it on the market
[3:08:50.560 --> 3:08:55.680]  knowing Gardasil killed all those people on record and hurt so many others and sterilizes a lot of
[3:08:55.680 --> 3:09:02.720]  women they're using it the third world so there's so many cases of this rob do this is just massive
[3:09:02.720 --> 3:09:08.480]  this video was from December 3rd this just got leaked to us this isn't even out there
[3:09:08.480 --> 3:09:12.320]  from the activists we've talked to this report's just now coming out here we want to talk about
[3:09:12.320 --> 3:09:15.920]  who those activists are and more and again i want to do justice to what they're doing so we'll do a
[3:09:15.920 --> 3:09:20.400]  whole report it's out sometime next week we'll get an article up today with this video this is
[3:09:20.400 --> 3:09:24.080]  really if people need to know this and let me explain what you're going to see what starts
[3:09:24.080 --> 3:09:30.800]  off in this video is this sumia swama swamathon she's head chief scientist at the un the who
[3:09:30.800 --> 3:09:34.400]  and she's talking about how vaccines are safe and effective and they do all this great stuff and oh
[3:09:34.400 --> 3:09:39.200]  they're great and then it cuts to a meeting that held in Geneva switzerland back in december
[3:09:39.200 --> 3:09:44.080]  december 3rd 2019 and she's like uh you know we don't know what's wrong with these things people
[3:09:44.080 --> 3:09:47.440]  are asking us why their children are dying and we can't give them answers so we have to be able to
[3:09:47.440 --> 3:09:51.200]  give them answers and she's like a lot of the time we don't find out what's wrong with these
[3:09:51.200 --> 3:09:56.480]  vaccines till after they're approved this is the insanity and you have armies of lemmings
[3:09:56.480 --> 3:10:01.280]  out there on twitter and on social media telling you you're a bad person you're gonna kill me and
[3:10:01.280 --> 3:10:05.040]  you don't take them yeah yeah that you're bad because you're not listening to these health
[3:10:05.040 --> 3:10:09.760]  officials who are saying in public meetings or though this one might have been private
[3:10:10.480 --> 3:10:14.320]  that we don't know why people are dying from these things we don't know why
[3:10:14.960 --> 3:10:19.280]  and they're not tested so we don't know because they're not tested and and if they are it's kept
[3:10:19.280 --> 3:10:24.480]  secret someone explain this they're saying we know stuff's going on but that's just the way it is but
[3:10:24.480 --> 3:10:29.840]  then she goes out this is leaked from the meeting and then she goes out and she's on television
[3:10:29.840 --> 3:10:33.760]  saying it's great you need to take it yeah it's absolutely outrageous and then later we're live
[3:10:33.760 --> 3:10:39.040]  right now but i want to add this in post and put out this afternoon just this live talk remember in
[3:10:39.040 --> 3:10:43.840]  2002 it came out on abc news back when they did their job they had some journalists left
[3:10:43.840 --> 3:10:47.680]  because they got the minutes via a lawsuit and then there was a whistleblower leaked more
[3:10:47.680 --> 3:10:52.560]  and then a congressman whose grandson got brain damage we can find this clip right well we'll add it
[3:10:53.680 --> 3:10:57.360]  his grandson was two years old took the shot at convulsions blood came out his nose never
[3:10:57.360 --> 3:11:03.360]  talked again yeah so he was in diapers 10 years later but back at that time he says bs he demanded
[3:11:03.360 --> 3:11:08.240]  it subpoenaed it from congress and got the full record of the head of the cdc saying my gosh i'm
[3:11:08.240 --> 3:11:13.040]  not giving my grandkids this we've damaged millions they'll kill us if they discover it these are the
[3:11:13.040 --> 3:11:19.200]  damn transcripts from the meeting with the head of the cdc cover it up my god they'll kill us but
[3:11:19.200 --> 3:11:24.080]  but it's but see once they got the cut but they also say we better clean this up oh yeah but you
[3:11:24.080 --> 3:11:29.680]  notice once they covered it all up there's never a cleanup the military has been given dozens of
[3:11:29.680 --> 3:11:34.480]  experimental vaccines like anthrax and others as guinea pigs but it's still illegal to give the
[3:11:34.480 --> 3:11:39.280]  military experimental vaccines unless the pentagon again declares an emergency just like governors
[3:11:39.280 --> 3:11:44.400]  do it so this is very very very dangerous ladies and gentlemen we're going to go to this clip right
[3:11:44.400 --> 3:11:53.280]  now here it is again and as a screen who works to ensure vaccinations are safe and effective
[3:11:53.280 --> 3:12:00.000]  here's the head of vaccines are very safe if someone gets sick after vaccination it is usually
[3:12:00.800 --> 3:12:07.280]  either a coincidence an error in administering the vaccine or very rarely a problem with the
[3:12:07.280 --> 3:12:14.240]  vaccine itself that's why we have vaccine safety systems robust vaccine safety systems
[3:12:14.240 --> 3:12:20.160]  allow health workers and experts to react immediately to any problems that may arise
[3:12:21.120 --> 3:12:28.560]  they can examine the problem rigorously and scientifically look at the data and then promptly
[3:12:28.560 --> 3:12:38.880]  address problem who works closely with countries to make sure that vaccines can do what they do
[3:12:38.880 --> 3:12:52.960]  best prevent disease without risks new vaccines against malaria meningitis and encephalitis
[3:12:52.960 --> 3:12:58.800]  in asia and africa and now being thoroughly monitored with support from who
[3:13:01.360 --> 3:13:06.080]  your shoes rolling out vaccines are one of the safest tools we have to prevent disease
[3:13:06.080 --> 3:13:11.440]  and ensure a healthy future for all children here's what she really said yeah five days later
[3:13:11.440 --> 3:13:16.800]  he discussed vaccine safety behind closed doors the who global vaccine safety summit here it is
[3:13:16.800 --> 3:13:23.120]  i think we cannot overemphasize the fact that that we really don't have very good safety
[3:13:23.120 --> 3:13:29.280]  monitoring systems in many countries and this adds to the miscommunication and the misapprehensions
[3:13:29.280 --> 3:13:34.320]  because we're not able to give clear cut answers when people ask questions about the deaths that
[3:13:34.320 --> 3:13:39.520]  have occurred due to particular vaccine and this always gets blown up in the media one should be
[3:13:39.520 --> 3:13:45.520]  able to give a very factual account of what exactly is happening what the cause of deaths are but in
[3:13:45.520 --> 3:13:51.680]  most cases there's some obfuscation at that level and and therefore there's less and less trust than
[3:13:51.680 --> 3:13:57.760]  in in in the system putting in place the mechanisms whether they're cohort studies or whether they're
[3:13:57.760 --> 3:14:04.880]  sentinel surveillance sites to be able to to monitor what's going on and report back and then for
[3:14:04.880 --> 3:14:10.560]  corrective action to be taken because unexpected things could arise after introduction and one
[3:14:10.560 --> 3:14:16.720]  always has to be prepared as we've seen you know the history of many drugs you've heard about i mean
[3:14:16.720 --> 3:14:22.000]  learned about adverse events only after the drugs being licensed and introduced into the population
[3:14:22.000 --> 3:14:27.680]  so i think that that risk is all always there and the population needs to understand that and and
[3:14:27.680 --> 3:14:34.560]  feel confident that mechanisms are being put in place to to study some of those things simply
[3:14:34.560 --> 3:14:39.360]  earth shattering and again she's just saying common sense stuff in fact if you look at different
[3:14:39.360 --> 3:14:43.600]  countries it varies but in the united states about a third of drugs end up getting pulled or they
[3:14:43.600 --> 3:14:48.400]  restrict them for only emergency situations and that's because they put them out and then they
[3:14:48.400 --> 3:14:52.480]  have problems they pull them back but with vaccines like oh no don't look at that and now they have
[3:14:52.480 --> 3:14:58.560]  vaccines for Alzheimer's vaccines for drug addiction they just call it a vaccine it's not no these
[3:14:58.560 --> 3:15:04.800]  things go in and kill certain nerve endings in the brain so that you can't absorb certain
[3:15:04.800 --> 3:15:09.520]  endorphins that are associated with heroin or cocaine but that also kills your normal endorphins
[3:15:09.520 --> 3:15:15.120]  it makes you a zombie or or they have again Alzheimer's vaccine that has the body attack
[3:15:15.120 --> 3:15:19.600]  certain proteins in the brain and then it has all these other side effects so vaccine just means
[3:15:19.600 --> 3:15:23.840]  something they're gonna inject in you and they're gonna have liability protection how freaking crazy
[3:15:23.840 --> 3:15:28.080]  is that rob it's ridiculous and the fact that people fall for it people don't want to ask questions
[3:15:28.080 --> 3:15:32.960]  people are afraid to question the medical model is even scarier that they will willingly line their
[3:15:32.960 --> 3:15:40.160]  children up to be systematically mentally and physically destroyed it's so sick the world leaders
[3:15:40.160 --> 3:15:44.560]  have secret clean vaccines i want access to those clean ones don't tell me i don't believe in the

[3:19:03.840 --> 3:19:08.880]  get sick now again i might get sick tomorrow because i just made that statement i'm not
[3:19:08.880 --> 3:19:13.360]  tempting fate i'll say that again because i am superstitious when it comes down to that
[3:19:13.360 --> 3:19:19.440]  very thankful to good lord for the constitution i've been given but up until about eight nine
[3:19:19.440 --> 3:19:26.320]  years ago when i started taking x2 and the products enforce life i i still got sick every couple
[3:19:26.320 --> 3:19:32.000]  years and you know i still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like that but
[3:19:32.880 --> 3:19:37.840]  now that i religiously take the products that enforce life or the highest quality
[3:19:37.840 --> 3:19:44.000]  supplements you're gonna find out there i just never get a fever anymore it's probably been
[3:19:45.600 --> 3:19:51.520]  three four years since i've had a fever it's just crazy so i chalk it up to genetics and the great
[3:19:51.520 --> 3:20:09.520]  products you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:09.520 --> 3:20:22.720]  earthpulse.com earthpulse.com if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance you're listening to alex jones a lot of big news has been breaking on
[3:20:22.720 --> 3:20:28.160]  fridays and i beg dr nick back to do a show once a week here and then but he's such a trooper i've preempted
[3:20:28.160 --> 3:20:32.240]  him like three times in a row so i apologize he's taken over in just a few minutes but then this huge
[3:20:32.240 --> 3:20:36.000]  news was breaking on the vaccine cover-ups were going to him and he's taken over here in just one
[3:20:36.000 --> 3:20:42.800]  moment but but robs is finishing up um this is the head of the world health organization science
[3:20:42.800 --> 3:20:49.120]  bureau right chief scientist chief scientist of the un saying these are killing people we're covering it
[3:20:49.120 --> 3:20:54.000]  up we don't have a surveillance system people are hearing about it they're getting pissed we better clean
[3:20:54.000 --> 3:20:58.080]  it up you gotta figure out a way to lie to him essentially is what she's saying yeah so so long
[3:20:58.080 --> 3:21:03.040]  this has been days after she tells the lies this is all safe yeah folks it's over they're not going to
[3:21:03.040 --> 3:21:08.240]  be able to cover this up with facebook censoring these discussions it's over so a big report's
[3:21:08.240 --> 3:21:12.080]  coming out on that today we'll add some clips what we just did right and then knowing you and i
[3:21:12.080 --> 3:21:15.520]  will work over the weekend to get this out because i'm already up here all weekend but this is huge
[3:21:15.520 --> 3:21:19.840]  brother it really is and you gotta look at the people in new jersey who are fighting for their
[3:21:19.840 --> 3:21:24.640]  health freedom right now they're they're storming congress they're speaking out because they're not
[3:21:24.640 --> 3:21:30.080]  taking this oh safe and effective answer as an answer anymore they know they've seen the children
[3:21:30.080 --> 3:21:35.200]  it's and we have a vaccine killed hundreds of years military conservatively they admitted it was
[3:21:35.200 --> 3:21:40.400]  killing people stop saying it doesn't hurt people stop saying it's all safe you just have to look at
[3:21:40.400 --> 3:21:44.480]  the children everybody knows that the peanut allergies because they grew vaccines on peanuts
[3:21:44.480 --> 3:21:48.640]  yeah and then they stopped doing it and then now all these kids aren't being born that die if they go
[3:21:48.640 --> 3:21:54.640]  around peanuts i mean it's real simple you people are out of control and and and the trailblazer
[3:21:54.640 --> 3:21:59.200]  literally before i was here anybody on the science was under nick baggage he's taking over in a moment
[3:21:59.200 --> 3:22:03.680]  rob let's do this last thing we got to get him on yeah well speaking out speaking out this elizabeth
[3:22:03.680 --> 3:22:08.640]  warren clip everything is about confronting the scum with the fact and knowledge like oan did
[3:22:08.640 --> 3:22:12.560]  like everybody's doing like you've been doing folks this is what's going to defeat them not just
[3:22:12.560 --> 3:22:17.200]  get trump in trump's not perfect trump isn't gonna save us we're gonna save ourselves with god's help
[3:22:17.200 --> 3:22:22.240]  we got to confront all these scum like pocahontas tell us what happened this guy war's dot com this
[3:22:22.240 --> 3:22:26.960]  biker with a cross on his back goes in and confronts her and tells her she's a fraud and
[3:22:26.960 --> 3:22:33.520]  disgusting for siding with iran in this situation and we need more people like this his his relatives
[3:22:33.520 --> 3:22:38.480]  were veterans and he's he's sick and tired of these people marching around like they own the place
[3:22:38.480 --> 3:22:42.640]  well especially when obama and all them help do this whole destabilization sure as i don't like
[3:22:42.640 --> 3:22:48.480]  all this expansion of war stuff but but the point is that unifying suddenly the left you love love
[3:22:48.480 --> 3:22:53.200]  war then trumps against it you know now they love war then trump looks like he's for war now they're
[3:22:53.200 --> 3:23:01.120]  against war here is the confrontation it's so good to be here with you this is
[3:23:01.120 --> 3:23:03.120]  what
[3:23:22.560 --> 3:23:27.280]  first amendment in action right there and whether you agree with this guy or not the point is elizabeth
[3:23:27.280 --> 3:23:32.800]  warren is an anti-american globalist they need to be confronted and this is what they fear and she
[3:23:32.800 --> 3:23:42.960]  goes i'm oh it's nice to have you here it's good to see you oh i'm having a beer what one

[3:25:55.680 --> 3:26:00.000]  night for those that might have caught me i was on coast to coast day i'm sort of the other end of
[3:26:00.560 --> 3:26:07.440]  the radio spectrum uh talking about issues that matter you know and here's the thing all this
[3:26:07.440 --> 3:26:13.680]  stuff that we've been talking about and everything on today again are symptoms right of people behaving
[3:26:13.680 --> 3:26:19.440]  badly and alex is right you know whatever trump is for the democrats will be against and whatever
[3:26:19.440 --> 3:26:25.920]  he's against they'll be for because it isn't about policy it's about tribalism it's about separation
[3:26:25.920 --> 3:26:31.520]  it's about breaking up the human spirit dissolving us into some battle that doesn't need to happen
[3:26:31.520 --> 3:26:39.040]  because what i know and a lot of my discussion lately has been about this is the underlying value
[3:26:39.040 --> 3:26:44.800]  systems if you can keep them alive aren't gone but here's what's happened and this is like the mind
[3:26:44.800 --> 3:26:51.600]  control of the game uh and it's really simple because here's how propaganda works first thing
[3:26:51.600 --> 3:26:57.920]  you do and this what happened in germany why a lot of very educated people in 30s did all this crazy
[3:26:57.920 --> 3:27:03.760]  atrocious kind of stuff you know but here's how it starts the first thing you have to do is get
[3:27:03.760 --> 3:27:11.360]  people to to shut up and quit speaking their truth because in those days you know you might get in
[3:27:11.360 --> 3:27:17.360]  trouble and today you might get trouble political correctness you know so we everyone guards their
[3:27:17.360 --> 3:27:25.520]  speech withholds their truth and then what happens on the left often is they then begin to repeat
[3:27:25.520 --> 3:27:29.440]  something that they don't believe in it also happens on the right so people begin to
[3:27:30.000 --> 3:27:35.360]  express things they don't believe in and then as you do that you shut down your consciousness that
[3:27:35.360 --> 3:27:42.160]  part of your brain and your awareness that connects you to all that is if you will you know uh and and
[3:27:42.160 --> 3:27:49.040]  so the slippery slope is first you lie to yourself they call this tolerance you know and i've talked
[3:27:49.040 --> 3:27:54.640]  about this before and we need to think about this differently i talk about acceptance except the fact
[3:27:54.640 --> 3:27:59.360]  that the guy is going to disagree with you that's a fact to the matter you're going to run into it
[3:27:59.360 --> 3:28:04.880]  but do this with a with dignity in terms of the discussion this is where it turns the corner maybe
[3:28:04.880 --> 3:28:09.920]  we get somewhere as you got to be able to recognize that we're created the image and likeness of God
[3:28:09.920 --> 3:28:15.040]  so when you look in the eyes of your adversary you see yourself a little bit there and as you do
[3:28:15.600 --> 3:28:21.360]  listen carefully to all the arguments most people have some logic stream you hope and then you get
[3:28:21.360 --> 3:28:25.200]  the facts you're missing or you find out what hole there is there in their argument you got to
[3:28:25.200 --> 3:28:30.560]  test to present it and that changes the world and together it's about information info wars
[3:28:30.560 --> 3:28:37.200]  and i want to talk about info wars and what is not social media but is in fact social manipulation
[3:28:37.200 --> 3:28:43.280]  that we have to guard against which requires thinking with a heart with a consciousness with
[3:28:43.280 --> 3:28:49.200]  what we are in our fundamental creative being so together let's do the info wars we'll be right
[3:28:49.200 --> 3:28:56.160]  back in just a couple of minutes we can all agree these are troubled times right so do you know who's

[3:29:58.000 --> 3:30:04.080]  we have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including
[3:30:04.080 --> 3:30:11.520]  promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s
[3:30:11.520 --> 3:30:16.720]  researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal
[3:30:16.720 --> 3:30:22.240]  immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this effect in published trials and
[3:30:22.240 --> 3:30:27.680]  decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that
[3:30:27.680 --> 3:30:33.520]  helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is not an
[3:30:33.520 --> 3:30:38.800]  antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity
[3:30:38.800 --> 3:30:44.640]  of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body
[3:30:44.640 --> 3:30:50.320]  go outside and enjoy the air you breathe head to info wars life dot com and grab a pack of our

[3:32:07.360 --> 3:32:13.040]  all their crimes against humanity to see evil running rampant like this and to know
[3:32:13.840 --> 3:32:19.280]  that most americans have already been silenced in cyberspace that most americans have already
[3:32:19.280 --> 3:32:25.680]  been shadow banned by big tech and to know that most americans feel powerless and don't realize
[3:32:25.680 --> 3:32:32.960]  how much power they have by spreading the word about news wars dot com info wars dot com and
[3:32:32.960 --> 3:32:37.600]  banned on video and that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever and then if you tell
[3:32:37.600 --> 3:32:43.520]  people hey the banned truth they don't want you to have is it info wars dot com forward slash show
[3:32:43.520 --> 3:32:48.800]  in banned on video so take heart folks they've had to censor everybody to show everybody down
[3:32:48.800 --> 3:32:52.080]  because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square
[3:32:52.080 --> 3:33:08.000]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:14.320 --> 3:33:20.320]  and welcome back to i am paul wars and this is uh dr nick faggots coming to you from my home in
[3:33:20.320 --> 3:33:25.760]  alaska and i was during the break i was talking to shon and uh you know it's minus 12 here today
[3:33:25.760 --> 3:33:33.760]  and supposed to be minus 20 later you know so it's cold i mean it is cold and it is dark uh
[3:33:34.480 --> 3:33:42.720]  dark and uh so anyway alaska what a place and you know thinking about uh some of the things
[3:33:42.720 --> 3:33:46.960]  happening in the world and talking about just going into the last break getting into the topic
[3:33:46.960 --> 3:33:53.120]  of the day which to me is really about social manipulation um and how that all happens and
[3:33:53.120 --> 3:33:59.440]  what's happening and not just creating culture and reality i mean really fundamentally forming
[3:33:59.440 --> 3:34:08.880]  reality all around us and i'm 61 this year and uh you know and and headed for uh 62 and and 2020
[3:34:08.880 --> 3:34:15.120]  represents to me vision right 2020 vision and we should each get a vision for our life a vision
[3:34:15.120 --> 3:34:20.720]  for this uh network a vision for the country and where we're headed because and wherever you
[3:34:20.720 --> 3:34:26.640]  live in whatever sovereign land you're hearing this you know i mean it's about our own countries
[3:34:26.640 --> 3:34:32.160]  and the things we can do when we share values in common uh that makes sense otherwise you know
[3:34:32.160 --> 3:34:39.280]  we have to respect our sovereignty as individuals and uh as communities uh and as countries quite
[3:34:39.280 --> 3:34:46.000]  frankly and you know that's why america is you know a republic kind of a federation of states too
[3:34:46.000 --> 3:34:51.280]  and uh although we kind of forgot a lot of that along the way which is a topic for another day
[3:34:51.280 --> 3:34:57.440]  but uh having said that you know um personal privacy social manipulation how's that playing
[3:34:57.440 --> 3:35:03.040]  out you know and i was really looking at my material i published in 2020 years ago and then
[3:35:03.040 --> 3:35:07.760]  you know kind of looking back in time and what we predicted then and sort of where we're at now
[3:35:07.760 --> 3:35:12.880]  and everyone's so amazed you know about all this stuff they think is so cool that's so convenient
[3:35:12.880 --> 3:35:17.920]  we said hey wait a minute remember there'll be a flip side to the equation and yeah you'll be
[3:35:17.920 --> 3:35:25.040]  under the microscope uh and we are um we have fundamentally given up every shred of personal
[3:35:25.040 --> 3:35:30.320]  privacy and you know you can look at it from this perspective you know here's a thing for the future
[3:35:30.320 --> 3:35:35.120]  that's happening now right because it's already been piloted and tested all that but because of
[3:35:35.120 --> 3:35:40.080]  electric cars and now the imbalance on japan for roads because it's not out of the gasoline tax you're
[3:35:40.080 --> 3:35:45.840]  going to hear them tax by the mile and all that meters on your cars will track your miles in every
[3:35:45.840 --> 3:35:52.480]  place you go to register your tax right and then that will set your insurance premiums right and
[3:35:52.480 --> 3:35:57.600]  then everywhere you stop you know like the liquor store or you know wherever you made your route to
[3:35:57.600 --> 3:36:02.800]  junk food restaurants six times a week or whatever you know i mean that'll all affect your rates and
[3:36:02.800 --> 3:36:09.520]  your ratings and as data is collected see it all ties back into the economic system and the feedback
[3:36:09.520 --> 3:36:15.920]  loops that you know make you a commodity as a taxpayer consumer voter whatever however you're
[3:36:15.920 --> 3:36:21.760]  being commodity made into a commodity for whoever's industry at the time who's grabbing all of your
[3:36:21.760 --> 3:36:26.960]  data bits and then tooking it back at you in a way that you'll respond like up have loves dogs
[3:36:26.960 --> 3:36:32.720]  and salivating you know and this is what is actually happening i predicted alex predicted it
[3:36:32.720 --> 3:36:37.760]  that's why it's an info war ladies and gentlemen because it really is about information but more
[3:36:37.760 --> 3:36:43.360]  importantly it's about how it's programmed in and there's a guy out there dr robert eppstein and i
[3:36:43.360 --> 3:36:49.040]  know i'm confusing with the pervert eppstein this is dr robert eppstein and he did this study that
[3:36:49.040 --> 3:36:53.680]  got peer reviewed about this in social media how it works and he looked at being in google and a
[3:36:53.680 --> 3:36:59.200]  few others in google interesting was the one that manipulates the data in such a way as to move numbers
[3:36:59.200 --> 3:37:07.040]  20 to 80 percent uh holy moly not 2.6 million votes that's the small number in the equation that
[3:37:07.040 --> 3:37:13.360]  dr robert eppstein testified to the big broad sweep is on neutral issues you can move populations
[3:37:13.360 --> 3:37:19.040]  20 to 80 percent which is enough to win anything or to move things and start to push the crowd
[3:37:19.040 --> 3:37:24.160]  into a direction and this is what i'm talking about propaganda and manipulation and the things
[3:37:24.160 --> 3:37:31.520]  we predicted when big data and data valence which is the phrase we used 20 years ago manifested
[3:37:31.520 --> 3:37:36.640]  people don't worry don't worry you know they can't even sort the data why worry why worry
[3:37:36.640 --> 3:37:41.600]  well we told you why because they would sort the data and they would have the data and they go
[3:37:41.600 --> 3:37:46.080]  backwards in time and predict your life or were better than you can even do it and that's where
[3:37:46.080 --> 3:37:52.160]  we're at today and we just got revealed that Cambridge analytics influenced 68 countries
[3:37:52.160 --> 3:37:57.760]  elections not just one something we predicted 20 years ago in the book earth rising the revolution
[3:37:57.760 --> 3:38:03.600]  and earth rising too you know those books the only place you can get them in the world is info
[3:38:03.600 --> 3:38:09.760]  wars store dot com so i don't even sell them on my website go look or pulse dot com you can't buy
[3:38:09.760 --> 3:38:15.120]  anything there the only place i sell books and videos anymore uh unless they're electronic on
[3:38:15.120 --> 3:38:21.280]  amazon because i'm stuck in that window for now uh everyone else i shut it down moved it all over
[3:38:21.280 --> 3:38:27.200]  info wars because it's about info wars and that's who i'm supporting and they're helping me create
[3:38:27.200 --> 3:38:33.280]  content so i can get these issues out to you so you or your part is support info wars please
[3:38:33.280 --> 3:38:39.520]  so we can keep talking about all the things that are important but social media is misnamed as part
[3:38:39.520 --> 3:38:45.040]  of this new phrase that you always hear now that you never heard 20 years ago salt called creating
[3:38:45.040 --> 3:38:51.440]  a narrative you know that's called like lying in a nice way creating a narrative forget that
[3:38:51.440 --> 3:38:56.240]  terminology it's just switching words around but the meaning is the same you know painting a picture
[3:38:56.240 --> 3:39:03.120]  that might have a little bit of too much pain in one corner you know so here's the deal is uh it's
[3:39:03.120 --> 3:39:08.640]  about information getting it out and then you know sometimes you know we get it wrong but that's not
[3:39:08.640 --> 3:39:14.960]  very often on 25 years i've been in it and that with alex as an example you know a lot of issues
[3:39:14.960 --> 3:39:20.400]  and don't get it wrong very often that comes sometimes we do and and we take responsibility
[3:39:20.400 --> 3:39:25.920]  like you know journalists and people who research and try and convince you about something ought to
[3:39:25.920 --> 3:39:32.240]  do but here's the thing is the narrative that's being shoved down our throat is a feedback loop
[3:39:32.240 --> 3:39:38.080]  that has become so pervasive so i i'm doing this local initiative here in anchorage and i've talked
[3:39:38.080 --> 3:39:43.280]  a little bit about it you know intervention 2020 about what i think homelessness is which is a
[3:39:43.280 --> 3:39:48.240]  false narrative also it's about drug addiction alcoholism and mental illness that results in
[3:39:48.240 --> 3:39:53.680]  the symptom of homelessness but that's we'll get into that maybe if we have time today but the point
[3:39:53.680 --> 3:39:59.760]  is narratives forming narratives and then kind of painting the picture so you can go sell something
[3:39:59.760 --> 3:40:07.520]  this is so much of what we are facing now is about that and we provide the raw data in a way that
[3:40:07.520 --> 3:40:14.080]  if somebody just literally kicked in every one of our doorways walked in our houses and just
[3:40:14.080 --> 3:40:21.440]  rummaged through everything in our house we're letting them do that with our digital doorways
[3:40:21.440 --> 3:40:26.880]  that hold more information than any of us hold in our houses and the rules support that and how
[3:40:26.880 --> 3:40:33.200]  does that support liberty and freedom and democracy and a republic or anything that is even close to
[3:40:33.200 --> 3:40:40.880]  that and then what they do is they feed this garbage back that is not a reflection of reality but a
[3:40:40.880 --> 3:40:48.240]  way to move reality down the direction and this is the dangerous situation that we're in right now
[3:40:48.240 --> 3:40:55.360]  is here's what we also know about it is the brain activity that occurs the reward system in the
[3:40:55.360 --> 3:41:00.720]  brain is so incredible it creates addictive behaviors and then to make them even better they
[3:41:00.720 --> 3:41:06.880]  use three-dimensional MRIs look at the brain in real time creating gaming and all of the interactions
[3:41:06.880 --> 3:41:12.000]  with the internet because everyone's competing for your attention to then move the herd and the
[3:41:12.000 --> 3:41:17.200]  better they move the herd the more money people pay them to do it and here's the last semblance
[3:41:17.200 --> 3:41:23.680]  of independent media there's a few portals left in the world you know that at least appear to be
[3:41:23.680 --> 3:41:31.040]  presenting an alternative view and info wars is one that I totally support coast to coast for their
[3:41:31.040 --> 3:41:39.040]  opposite spectrum I do nexus which is an information speed nexus news feed I support zero hedge and
[3:41:39.040 --> 3:41:45.200]  drudge you know because these give you an aggregation of things and you can sort it out you know
[3:41:45.200 --> 3:41:51.040]  and I appreciate that because that means that we're intelligent enough to sort it out and I believe
[3:41:51.040 --> 3:41:57.680]  in you to sort it out and don't let anyone shut our voices down because you can change the channel
[3:41:57.680 --> 3:42:04.080]  there's a billion channels you know everyone's competing for everyone's attention but pay attention
[3:42:04.960 --> 3:42:10.320]  pay attention is one of the secrets of it all and look in other directions from time to time
[3:42:10.320 --> 3:42:16.320]  to get a broader perspective on what's going on in the world so you can engage it with knowledge
[3:42:16.320 --> 3:42:21.920]  and the force of emotion and personality that each of us carry when we're carrying our knowledge
[3:42:21.920 --> 3:42:27.760]  and do it respectfully and with dignity and instead of being in media manipulation land in
[3:42:27.760 --> 3:42:34.960]  reality tv land move it around not social manipulation anymore that they call social media our new
[3:42:34.960 --> 3:42:41.840]  narrative is freedom liberty and our pursuit of happiness by self actualizing our help our highest
[3:42:41.840 --> 3:42:46.880]  potential has created living souls on the planet that's what we ought to be doing and that's the
[3:42:46.880 --> 3:42:56.000]  first piece of the info war i'll be right back i spend a lot of time reminding the info wars
[3:42:56.000 --> 3:43:01.760]  the family of listeners and viewers that without you we won't be on the air and i spent a lot of
[3:43:01.760 --> 3:43:07.200]  time thanking you but i really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really
[3:43:07.200 --> 3:43:11.200]  changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reviewers but
[3:43:11.200 --> 3:43:17.040]  something i should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really
[3:43:17.040 --> 3:43:21.520]  amazing you've got that pledge from me but you've seen the third party test out there the air
[3:43:21.520 --> 3:43:26.880]  filtration the water filtration the supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there
[3:43:26.880 --> 3:43:33.920]  and you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard so it's
[3:43:33.920 --> 3:43:42.080]  not a burden to support info wars it really is something that is good for everybody that stands
[3:43:42.080 --> 3:43:46.880]  for justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life
[3:43:46.880 --> 3:43:54.480]  so much better so visit info or store dot com today i keep my eye on the news all the time
[3:43:54.480 --> 3:44:05.280]  but i miss the fact that in late 2019 just about two weeks ago the cdc and the fda approved live
[3:44:05.280 --> 3:44:11.120]  ebola vaccine to be given inside the united states and it is an experimental vaccine
[3:44:12.000 --> 3:44:19.280]  it is live it's not even attenuated they've just genetically modified it so it's supposedly not
[3:44:19.280 --> 3:44:26.080]  lethal same stuff they did with the garter cell vaccine that's admittedly killed a name so many
[3:44:26.080 --> 3:44:32.720]  this is just crazy and the congos had the biggest outbreaks of ebola ever since they started giving
[3:44:32.720 --> 3:44:37.360]  the vaccine there in the last few years oh and of course open the borders up here and letting
[3:44:37.360 --> 3:44:44.080]  people in unvetted the democrats distribute across the country you cannot make up the magnitude of
[3:44:44.080 --> 3:44:50.240]  this insanity and it is an attempted ebola assault on america this is the new world order
[3:44:52.880 --> 3:44:59.840]  it's either happened to every person listening or it's happened to someone you know everybody
[3:44:59.840 --> 3:45:06.800]  is well aware of the fact that most people that end up getting the flu have taken the flu vaccine
[3:45:06.800 --> 3:45:14.560]  right before they get it and they get the worst case of the flu of their life but still like
[3:45:14.560 --> 3:45:21.760]  concentration camp victims they line up at the different pharmacies and clinics to get the injections
[3:45:21.760 --> 3:45:26.640]  it doesn't matter that studies mainline government studies in canada in europe show that when you
[3:45:26.640 --> 3:45:32.080]  take the flu vaccine it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next season by lowering your
[3:45:32.080 --> 3:45:38.160]  immunity it goes on and on or the fact that the governments have never guessed the next year's
[3:45:38.160 --> 3:45:45.520]  mutation at the flu vaccine has never ever even worked but how do you prop up a hoax you keep the
[3:45:45.520 --> 3:45:50.960]  giant hoax going no wonder we've got one of the worst flu seasons on record happening right now
[3:45:52.480 --> 3:45:58.000]  if you understand why the globalist why the servants of satan hate info wars it's because
[3:45:58.000 --> 3:46:05.760]  we're awake we're alive we're passionate and we're not giving up that's why it's critical for those
[3:46:05.760 --> 3:46:11.440]  of us that are aware of the new world order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they
[3:46:11.440 --> 3:46:18.240]  persecute us and they lie about us that's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags
[3:46:18.240 --> 3:46:22.960]  the globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side and they do what they do because
[3:46:22.960 --> 3:46:28.960]  they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the
[3:46:28.960 --> 3:46:35.680]  innocent it is up to us who are awake not the sheep and not the wolves but the sheet dogs
[3:46:35.680 --> 3:46:42.960]  to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants they fear the fact that we are awake they fear
[3:46:42.960 --> 3:46:50.240]  the fact that we are alive they fear the fact that we love god and that's all we ever have to know
[3:46:50.240 --> 3:46:54.080]  is that god is in charge
[3:46:56.160 --> 3:47:02.080]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:02.080 --> 3:47:22.480]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's nick baggage you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:22.480 --> 3:47:29.360]  and welcome back and you know talking about this whole
[3:47:30.800 --> 3:47:36.000]  surveillance set you know when you stop and think about think about how much information i was using
[3:47:36.000 --> 3:47:40.800]  the illustration of what they'll do with tracking your car and then your movements and then it affects
[3:47:40.800 --> 3:47:45.840]  your insurance and then it shows where you stop which affects other aspects and then uh and then
[3:47:45.840 --> 3:47:51.600]  they show who was with you at the time because their little device tells her you know delivers
[3:47:51.600 --> 3:47:56.800]  the same information and then you look at all those overlays and then you look at what's happening
[3:47:56.800 --> 3:48:01.920]  in the world in the video feed that's showing the chinese version of facial recognition now that
[3:48:01.920 --> 3:48:08.400]  i mean it's total absolute control those that listen already know the chinese model of social
[3:48:08.400 --> 3:48:14.880]  scoring the india model of biometrics using pre-primiters fingerprints iris scans of facial
[3:48:14.880 --> 3:48:20.480]  recognition those overlays and now the german european overlay that's playing out right now
[3:48:20.480 --> 3:48:25.440]  is digital uh money because they pay negative interest rates on your savings so if you put
[3:48:25.440 --> 3:48:32.160]  their money out of german banks into cash and put it in safes and then what also happened is they
[3:48:32.160 --> 3:48:39.280]  made a new law affected the first of this year 2020 to make gold purchases reportable in germany if
[3:48:39.280 --> 3:48:45.600]  you buy over a thousand euros which is less than one out so by the end of the year all retail stores
[3:48:45.600 --> 3:48:50.160]  in germany were pretty much out of stock and there were lines blocked for too long with people buying
[3:48:50.160 --> 3:48:54.960]  gold because what's probably going to happen in germany is you're going to tax the gold that's another
[3:48:54.960 --> 3:49:01.760]  way to create a revenue stream uh to the government so you've got these uh negative interest rates
[3:49:01.760 --> 3:49:06.320]  they go to digital currency now you're stuck all your money's in and they're taken a little bit
[3:49:06.320 --> 3:49:12.640]  every month from you this is the new model for europe coming by way of germany so when you start
[3:49:12.640 --> 3:49:17.280]  laying and then of course to protect your money your digital month then they want your facial
[3:49:17.280 --> 3:49:21.440]  recognition so they're going to probably run it in reverse but they know it'll work because it's
[3:49:21.440 --> 3:49:26.160]  all been played out in india and the social scoring to get you in the game and keep you
[3:49:26.160 --> 3:49:32.160]  politically correct has been played out in india and brought to you by the new world order right
[3:49:32.160 --> 3:49:38.640]  whoever they are uh it's not about you anymore it's anything more than a commodity uh plugged into
[3:49:38.640 --> 3:49:44.560]  the thing you're a digital dot on the budget book you're we represent nothing to these people and yet
[3:49:44.560 --> 3:49:51.280]  that within us if we really believe this is the spark of absolute creation you know and what we are
[3:49:51.280 --> 3:49:58.160]  and and and we fail to see it that's what scares uh the heck out of uh the other side of this whole
[3:49:58.160 --> 3:50:03.760]  equation is because when we actualize our potential each one of us listening to this broadcast become
[3:50:03.760 --> 3:50:10.160]  that tip of the spear and do something uh that's positive proactive that recognizes what we are uh
[3:50:10.160 --> 3:50:16.560]  uh that is where the dignity of man defines us from something else and that something else has
[3:50:16.560 --> 3:50:21.920]  had too much of control of the agenda and all of the things that we're talking about in info wars
[3:50:21.920 --> 3:50:28.640]  whether it was for me whether it was mind control hard personal privacy resources banking you know
[3:50:28.640 --> 3:50:33.760]  all the things that everyone covers on this network health issues from vaccinate vaccination
[3:50:33.760 --> 3:50:40.000]  vaccination to nutrition of various forms you all of the discussions that we get to have here are by
[3:50:40.000 --> 3:50:46.240]  virtues we're not centered except by a few and that censoring is what is destroying our ability
[3:50:46.240 --> 3:50:53.520]  uh to see freedom ring in the 21st century and devices um kind of might take the big solution
[3:50:53.520 --> 3:50:58.080]  to this you know because that's the other half of the thing it's okay we all know this problem
[3:50:58.080 --> 3:51:02.560]  is we have to own our digital data and this is what that means and it's going to really make people
[3:51:02.560 --> 3:51:07.360]  uncomfortable that are making money off of it right now but the truth is we have to own our
[3:51:07.360 --> 3:51:12.400]  digital data and not allow anyone to exploit it in the way that it is we should need to make it
[3:51:12.400 --> 3:51:18.800]  illegal that we own the data period if it belongs to us and we can't give it up we can't opt in or
[3:51:18.800 --> 3:51:24.560]  opt out or however they want to word it so they can get by the law because it's like um you know
[3:51:24.560 --> 3:51:30.240]  sort of a base thing of our humanity that you don't get to give up or volunteer away or anyone
[3:51:30.240 --> 3:51:35.040]  even gets to ask you because that's criminal too you know you can't ask people to become slaves
[3:51:36.080 --> 3:51:40.720]  uh that doesn't work we can't do that we can't allow it and you can't say yes if you're asked
[3:51:40.720 --> 3:51:47.120]  so that's it and so this is what where we've come to with personal privacy today is we can't
[3:51:47.120 --> 3:51:52.480]  we have to take control of it again once we've done that and then we have to say okay if corporations
[3:51:52.480 --> 3:51:56.800]  have free speech and are right to influence elections political outcomes and they need
[3:51:56.800 --> 3:52:02.640]  culpability accountability responsibility which means boards and presidents and vice presidents
[3:52:02.640 --> 3:52:09.200]  of corporations need to go to prison when those corporations do things that violate yours and
[3:52:09.200 --> 3:52:14.800]  my privacy and civil liberties you see that way they can't say oh it's a corporation we can't uh no
[3:52:14.800 --> 3:52:19.200]  no the guys who run it oh but we didn't know what too bad you're running it and it's called
[3:52:19.200 --> 3:52:24.880]  accountability and responsibility you know these are uh uh principled ideas not conservative or
[3:52:24.880 --> 3:52:30.320]  level they're principled ideas that we used to share in common called accountability and people
[3:52:30.320 --> 3:52:36.880]  try to escape it all the time and this is the problem not the solution it's being responsible
[3:52:36.880 --> 3:52:41.280]  and then you know if you can't then the rest of us have to decide you know so that's called
[3:52:42.160 --> 3:52:49.360]  laws and order uh you know and execution and that's gotten a big complex for the average man
[3:52:49.360 --> 3:52:54.880]  doesn't really have access to justice in the same way that if you're rich uh you have access to
[3:52:54.880 --> 3:53:01.440]  justice ask Alex how much money it's spent on litigation because people attack him in that way
[3:53:01.440 --> 3:53:06.320]  hoping to shut him down and silence his voice and it's unfortunate you know I mean and then
[3:53:06.320 --> 3:53:11.120]  they talk about socializing medicine that was socializing justice you know socialized lawyers
[3:53:11.120 --> 3:53:15.680]  you know I mean at least that's something constitutionally we're supposed to have and
[3:53:15.680 --> 3:53:20.640]  he's it went from a law book in a couple volumes that Abraham Lincoln could hold under his arm
[3:53:20.640 --> 3:53:25.440]  and study and pass the bar and become a lawyer without going to college something that fills
[3:53:25.440 --> 3:53:31.280]  up three floors of a law library that nobody can sort out that's not justice in law that's
[3:53:31.280 --> 3:53:36.800]  complexity for the sake of a few whose interests is served by that complexity and what it yields
[3:53:36.800 --> 3:53:41.120]  for them and if you really look in the law library starting through you see nothing but
[3:53:41.120 --> 3:53:48.400]  special special uh interest legislation compounded on top of itself uh and here's the thing you know
[3:53:48.400 --> 3:53:54.880]  when you start to think about uh what it's about it started with a lot of debate a lot of argument
[3:53:54.880 --> 3:54:00.720]  a lot of fighting and see the republicans when Abraham Lincoln was the republican remember
[3:54:00.720 --> 3:54:05.520]  like he had to take away from the southern democrats slavery as kind of an issue you know
[3:54:05.520 --> 3:54:11.360]  and it made people angry then and politics has changed a lot in the last 150 years I have to say
[3:54:11.360 --> 3:54:17.520]  and thank god it has and there's bigger issues to fight over but I think fighting is the problem
[3:54:17.520 --> 3:54:24.320]  and respecting is part of the solution and then debate that's lively as part of the action plan
[3:54:24.320 --> 3:54:29.520]  and you know I've used my own family as an analogy because we have hard right republicans we have
[3:54:29.520 --> 3:54:36.320]  libertarians and we have moderates and we have independence and then we have uh democrats and
[3:54:36.320 --> 3:54:40.800]  then we have hard left democrats all of my family go into the same Thanksgiving and Christmas events
[3:54:40.800 --> 3:54:46.560]  you know and I can tell you it's a lively debate and the beauty of that debate is at the end we
[3:54:46.560 --> 3:54:52.800]  embrace each other uh respectfully as brothers and sisters which is the call to the nation right now
[3:54:52.800 --> 3:54:59.840]  as we look at this century and 2020 vision for this year and look forward into the next decade
[3:54:59.840 --> 3:55:06.880]  let's decide something different for it let's instead of media manipulation let's turn off
[3:55:07.760 --> 3:55:14.480]  the reality tv side and news feed and turn off the feedback loops of facebook and deal with the
[3:55:14.480 --> 3:55:20.080]  people we truly care about that we can give attention to face to face person to person
[3:55:20.080 --> 3:55:25.600]  wherever we can I travel a good bit so I show up in Austin every once while and mainly to embrace
[3:55:25.600 --> 3:55:32.480]  the team and personally um to do that because I think it's important to do that um I do it with
[3:55:32.480 --> 3:55:38.080]  my friends uh literally around the world that I work with professionally and my family and I
[3:55:38.080 --> 3:55:43.440]  encourage all of us to do that pick up the telephone you know that telephone I hate these device
[3:55:43.440 --> 3:55:49.760]  things but pick up your device and communicate with your friends and family and make a point of it
[3:55:49.760 --> 3:55:56.400]  in a personal way with your voice and your face over a cup of coffee with your kids um and do that
[3:55:56.400 --> 3:56:02.720]  and it makes the difference in the world and in doing it put a different intention on put a spin
[3:56:02.720 --> 3:56:10.400]  on it of respect um and integrity and values and try to find the way to break into the conversation
[3:56:10.400 --> 3:56:16.800]  and share the info wars with what you believe is important and get off of the train at the train
[3:56:16.800 --> 3:56:22.640]  direct that's operating in slow motion that's the manipulation of social media turn it off break
[3:56:22.640 --> 3:56:28.720]  the zombie trance it's here now we've been talking about it for 25 years it's here now uh the new
[3:56:28.720 --> 3:56:34.160]  this is the most unbelievable creation because here's how it works when you get this many people
[3:56:34.800 --> 3:56:42.400]  focused in the same way actually what happens is you begin to create the very fantasy that they
[3:56:42.400 --> 3:56:51.360]  share in common this is where you got to break off break it off and take a look around and um
[3:56:53.360 --> 3:56:58.000]  touch the world again in a different way and connect to each other in a different way
[3:56:58.000 --> 3:57:05.200]  and break off the tribalism that's driven by these systems it actually is designed to isolate
[3:57:05.200 --> 3:57:13.760]  manipulate control and push each of us in our own individualized programming plan so you
[3:57:13.760 --> 3:57:21.040]  got to cut off the programming a bit and you know and open yourself up to your relationships and then
[3:57:21.040 --> 3:57:26.160]  spread the information that is important in all those different ways to bring us in touch with
[3:57:26.160 --> 3:57:32.160]  each other this is friday afternoon uh in most of our world and i appreciate the time with info
[3:57:32.160 --> 3:57:37.600]  wars everyone going into the week and this is ben dr nick baggage uh signing off and we'll see you
[3:57:37.600 --> 3:58:03.200]  again next week
