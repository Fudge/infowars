[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:34.680]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones so-called security is nothing
[00:34.680 --> 00:41.240]  but an illusion and it's about the illusion of the government protecting us from some type of
[00:41.240 --> 00:46.280]  outside threat when nine times out of ten that outside threats actually being orchestrated by
[00:46.280 --> 00:53.960]  the very people that want to pose as saviors up on info wars.com we have a lot of breaking news
[00:53.960 --> 01:02.440]  but one of the biggest tidbits of information is Super Bowl hijack or hijacking proves government
[01:02.440 --> 01:11.960]  cannot protect you and of course that's Matthew Mills 30 year old Matthew Mills who was able to
[01:11.960 --> 01:18.520]  get up during the press conference being watched by tens of millions with the MVP who was mumbling
[01:18.520 --> 01:25.320]  into the microphone and was able to simply say that 9-11's an inside job and that it should be
[01:25.320 --> 01:39.960]  investigated and we as a society need to understand that this shows how vulnerable the power structure
[01:39.960 --> 01:45.880]  is and the different propaganda arms so we're going to play that clip in a moment do we have
[01:45.880 --> 01:53.000]  that clip ready let's roll that clip right now no I always imagine myself making great plays but
[01:53.000 --> 02:02.120]  you never think about being an MVP investigate 9-11 a 9-11 was perpetrated by people within our own
[02:02.120 --> 02:20.360]  government all right is everybody all right so there you go ladies and gentlemen let's
[02:20.360 --> 02:27.240]  let's watch that clip one more time I always imagine myself making great plays but you never
[02:27.240 --> 02:35.560]  think about being a VP investigate 9-11 a 9-11 was perpetrated by people within our own government
[02:38.360 --> 02:42.760]  by the way folks if little things like that continue to happen like Dan Badandi our reporter
[02:42.760 --> 02:50.440]  asking real questions about the drills at the Boston bombing it is over for the establishment
[02:51.240 --> 02:58.120]  if we go to city council county commissioners state house meetings and testify during citizens
[02:58.120 --> 03:05.800]  communications if we call into talk radio call in to c-span if we just constantly culture jam
[03:05.800 --> 03:11.960]  there are billions of us that know what's going on worldwide and if we all simply jack in to the
[03:11.960 --> 03:18.600]  establishment media we can totally overwhelm and dominate it and more and more it's happening we
[03:18.600 --> 03:24.440]  need to tell Obama he's a liar when it comes to his agenda just as that congressman did four years
[03:24.440 --> 03:31.800]  ago we need to call these people out and not just be spectators that man who got up there
[03:32.760 --> 03:39.400]  Matthew Mills aged 30 from New York that's the most valuable player of the Super Bowl
[03:39.400 --> 03:47.160]  he infiltrating all the stupid fake security and the mumbling so-called MVP I mean who cares about

[04:00.440 --> 04:11.000]  hard as he could he's not a loser and and and people rioted whenever the Seahawks won in in

[16:06.520 --> 16:10.040]  are you walking along some mexican you go start something with them for no reason you're dead
[16:10.680 --> 16:15.320]  you're gonna get stabbed real fast but those little thugs know that don't mess with a redneck

[16:30.360 --> 16:34.600]  because this is a big viral story i meant to call them thursday night when i first saw this video
[16:34.600 --> 16:39.080]  going viral that's now been seen tens of millions of times that nobody's covering because because
[16:39.080 --> 16:42.440]  i just want to give them these directives right now on air bring them on in not with microphones

[16:57.960 --> 17:02.280]  black attacks all over the country that the media won't say or black attacks because again we've
[17:02.280 --> 17:06.200]  talked about the klan when they do this or you know rolling gay people were against that but the
[17:06.200 --> 17:11.080]  point is that's not a phenomenon now because it's been culturally decried the phenomenon of beating
[17:11.080 --> 17:16.600]  up white women mainly because that's really who these cowards want to attack or white hippies i
[17:16.600 --> 17:21.080]  want to warn people along here walking around and i'm not gonna get along here if you talk you

[17:30.360 --> 17:35.160]  it's important to tie it into all the racial attacks that are going on and to point out
[17:35.160 --> 17:39.880]  that in downtown that's right at the end of sixth street right by the parking right by the police
[17:39.880 --> 17:44.360]  station i think it's like a less than 100 yards actually i said a block that the police can't
[17:44.360 --> 17:50.200]  won't protect you and that's why everybody needs a concealed carry but but again the fact is they're
[17:50.200 --> 17:54.120]  not going to mess with somebody in a sports jacket or a woman with a fanny pack because
[17:54.120 --> 17:58.600]  they know people are packing but i mean you wouldn't even need to pack on those guys i literally
[17:58.600 --> 18:05.080]  thought this was like oompa loompas racist black oompa loompas have literally literally from the

[25:56.600 --> 26:00.840]  as long as it was a good game that i i mean i watched about 30 minutes and left and i said
[26:00.840 --> 26:05.640]  it's clear they're going to lose and it didn't even matter to me it's just that's what people
[26:05.640 --> 26:10.440]  are doing so i i went to one first super bowl party i've been to that's not true last year i

[32:16.280 --> 32:22.680]  deciding to take action a company run by patriots for patriots was born my patriot supply has never
[32:22.680 --> 32:28.360]  taken a loan or accepted outside funding they now operate two distribution facilities and employ
[32:28.360 --> 32:33.240]  over 50 hard-working american men and women it is rare to find companies who practice what they

[33:10.120 --> 33:26.520]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[33:27.720 --> 33:32.600]  by the way i'm i'm having the crew post the video that i just remembered on air that i saw this
[33:32.600 --> 33:39.480]  weekend early the late last week of the racist black people six of them at least uh with their
[33:39.480 --> 33:45.560]  black girlfriends making fun of two trendy white liberal hippies that they beat up and stomp on
[33:45.560 --> 33:51.560]  their heads and mercilessly attack and then rob and this has been out since last thursday
[33:51.560 --> 34:00.360]  and literally happened at seventh and sixth on i-35 we've now looked on google maps 140 feet from
[34:00.360 --> 34:06.520]  the front door of the police station their police cars just lined up and parked there police everywhere
[34:06.520 --> 34:11.640]  and they beat them and it goes on and on and on with everyone celebrating and that's why i won't
[34:11.640 --> 34:18.440]  go down to sixth street anymore is because groups of racist black people we should go stake it out
[34:18.440 --> 34:24.920]  actually in our cars and videotape it rob and attack people every night and the media will not
[34:24.920 --> 34:31.640]  cover it imagine if the Ku Klux Klan was down in um downtown austin in the music district
[34:31.640 --> 34:39.640]  by the police station waiting to waylay and rob uh black people you would have jesse jackson out
[34:39.640 --> 34:44.840]  there but because it is the devil cracker it's okay and i personally have had enough of it and
[34:44.840 --> 34:48.840]  john bowne's brother plays in bands he was telling me he won't get on the sixth street anymore i was
[34:48.840 --> 34:55.640]  telling the story of what happened to him last year uh john bowne uh tell folks uh now now imagine
[34:55.640 --> 35:01.560]  in his case more than a dozen people coming to gang up and beat him up for no reason uh this
[35:01.560 --> 35:07.160]  is the opposite of being honorable this is so cowardly this is so pathetic and it will not be
[35:07.160 --> 35:17.080]  decried because the knockout game no one no one can even admit uh that that that this is a racist
[35:17.080 --> 35:23.080]  attack going on nationwide now al sharpton finally because so many videos came out of them beating
[35:23.080 --> 35:28.680]  up not just whites but other groups that are not black and he said it's disgusting and should stop
[35:28.680 --> 35:35.400]  but austin texas has the knockout game going on where they beat and stomp and attack innocent
[35:35.400 --> 35:42.600]  people and then celebrate it and then rob them and take their wallets so this is the type of
[35:42.600 --> 35:47.560]  garbage uh that is going on everywhere uh john bowne before i get into other news and get
[35:47.560 --> 35:52.440]  about the phone number uh tell folks uh your experiences uh downtown well i don't i don't
[35:52.440 --> 35:57.400]  go down to sixth street very much but my little brothers in a band called pacifier and they were
[35:57.400 --> 36:00.760]  they're a national band they were downtown playing and they got done around
[36:04.840 --> 36:11.640]  and uh and once they were done uh i was walking back to my car and there's a bunch of thugs just
[36:11.640 --> 36:17.960]  like that standing on the wall calling me all kinds of uh racist names right at that same spot uh
[36:17.960 --> 36:22.520]  well down towards sixth street a little bit more actually a little bit closer tell folks what you
[36:22.520 --> 36:28.120]  told me they said to you uh honky cracker white boy don't you want to get your butt kicked you
[36:28.120 --> 36:33.720]  know stuff like that just just trying to trying to rile me up don't they know it could go like
[36:33.720 --> 36:38.040]  the new york subway where the 10 thugs tried to rob the white guy for the upteenth time and
[36:38.040 --> 36:43.320]  got shot i mean don't they understand that that this is texas i know folks are moving in here from
[36:43.320 --> 36:48.680]  new york and california and stuff but i i mean i mean if i'm in my car and somebody tries that i
[36:48.680 --> 36:54.280]  mean i'm gonna pull out a 308 reaper i mean it's it's not gonna go well yeah they're gonna pick
[36:54.280 --> 36:59.480]  the wrong person uh and and the thing is you're you're within your legal right once they come up
[36:59.480 --> 37:04.440]  and try to rabbit punch you in the back of the head it's on you can protect yourself so when
[37:04.440 --> 37:11.880]  they come and do that to the wrong person it's uh it's a clobber in time well it's really amazing
[37:11.880 --> 37:15.800]  you know you and mcbreen already had like eight guys getting to fight with you and mcbreen beat
[37:15.800 --> 37:21.480]  a bunch of them up we haven't even told that story until now maybe we should get mcbreen in here uh
[37:21.480 --> 37:26.520]  but uh i mean it's just a bunch of thugs wanting to start fights down there and i gotta say it's
[37:26.520 --> 37:33.400]  almost exclusively black thugs trying to attack white people by the police station by the police
[37:33.400 --> 37:39.240]  station yeah right next to the police station and the police are apparently allowing this to happen
[37:39.240 --> 37:43.720]  but we'll see if any of those guys get arrested who knows it looks like hey balon since this happened
[37:43.720 --> 37:48.040]  to you i want you to go down there with a camera and show the spot where it happened to do a report
[37:48.040 --> 37:52.440]  for the nightly news tonight showing some excerpts of giving credit to the folks that shot that video
[37:52.440 --> 37:55.960]  it looks like the folks that shot the video might have might have been fans of it i'm not sure we
[37:55.960 --> 38:01.800]  need to ascertain that there's a lot of celebrating going on uh during this racial attack and robbery
[38:01.800 --> 38:07.000]  and and again you would think that this would be all over local news but uh i checked as of this uh
[38:07.000 --> 38:11.240]  morning and did not see it maybe i've missed it but but again you're not supposed to talk about
[38:11.240 --> 38:15.880]  these racial attacks just like you're not supposed to talk about obama care doubling the average premium
[38:15.880 --> 38:20.200]  or how it was written by foreign insurance companies uh because you know obama is our lord
[38:20.200 --> 38:27.560]  and savior as uh as jamie fox said and mangal talked about now since uh the movie jango unchained
[38:27.560 --> 38:32.440]  came out now everywhere he goes in chicago black people say we're going to kill you white cracker
[38:33.000 --> 38:39.560]  uh and then they'll say jango jango jango so great work quintin tarantino uh creating racial
[38:39.560 --> 38:45.480]  division and literally uh you've got all these self-loving trendy whites that literally hate
[38:45.480 --> 38:51.080]  themselves and hate the white race uh now being beaten and attacked and laying on the ground begging
[38:51.080 --> 38:55.640]  they're you know they're they're king and i think that's good i don't think just beating whites is
[38:55.640 --> 39:00.200]  enough whites are inherently evil i think all whites should be put in concentration camps
[39:00.200 --> 39:04.440]  and their heads beat in by blacks with ball peen hammers i think that's what martin luther king
[39:04.440 --> 39:09.320]  would want what do you think of john bound well i i just like to express something that comes to my
[39:09.320 --> 39:15.640]  mind all the time is the fact that i grew up in the 70s and i grew up in uh washington dc partly
[39:15.640 --> 39:22.360]  and black people white people we didn't know color all we knew was personality and now we've reached
[39:22.360 --> 39:27.720]  and it seems as if we've overcome that and we got beyond the segregated schooling and the
[39:27.720 --> 39:35.160]  busting and all that and we try to overcome that as a society as a culture shut up cracker but
[39:35.160 --> 39:40.360]  shut up you know you're racist and i'm going to knock your teeth out okay well i am from
[39:40.360 --> 39:45.160]  kentucky so i don't have a whole lot of teeth no no no no oh come on i like folks from kentucky
[39:45.160 --> 39:51.400]  i'm just kidding well i tell you uh no no it let listen imit listen the democratic party is the
[39:51.400 --> 39:55.400]  party of the kudcox clan and when they couldn't win that demographically they shifted to race
[39:55.400 --> 40:01.240]  baiting and they literally teach that all whites are racist all republicans are racist
[40:01.240 --> 40:06.440]  adopting a black baby's racist uh that i mean that's what they do that that's their job
[40:07.320 --> 40:12.280]  and they're doing great i predicted that all this race baiting would start racial attacks
[40:12.280 --> 40:17.080]  five years ago and now it's happening everywhere john bound yeah it's disgusting now i know you're
[40:17.080 --> 40:20.680]  in there it's your day of the week or whatever we rotate folks through to run the tv board
[40:20.680 --> 40:26.760]  but why don't you punch out go get on your suit and i want you to go get uh maybe take trolls with
[40:26.760 --> 40:33.640]  you uh take glen with you and i want you to go down there and uh to the corner of six and 35
[40:33.640 --> 40:38.360]  and let's just say you're going to be there at one o'clock anybody who's been racially attacked
[40:38.360 --> 40:41.800]  who wants to meet and be interviewed i don't care if you're black or white though we know it's
[40:41.800 --> 40:46.440]  going to all be whites because that is the devil the blue-eyed devil that deserves it thank god uh
[40:46.440 --> 40:53.800]  but uh we need everybody to go down there to 6th and uh 35 or 735 right in front of the police
[40:53.800 --> 40:58.600]  station i guess that's technically 7th and 35 this happened on 6th and 35 and you'll see john
[40:58.600 --> 41:02.760]  bound his camera he'll do a stand-up report tell his experience show some clips of that
[41:02.760 --> 41:08.360]  it'll be on the nightly news tonight on the show tomorrow and uh we will we will then if anybody
[41:08.360 --> 41:13.400]  wants to be a witness uh to what's happened to them or others uh that gives you an hour and 19
[41:13.400 --> 41:19.720]  minutes folks out on your lunch hour to go down and be quickly interviewed on or off camera uh by
[41:20.280 --> 41:25.640]  by uh john bound now i know because you're white more attacked you may be ashamed of the fact you're
[41:25.640 --> 41:29.800]  white and may not want to be on camera do to your i'm i'm very no no no but i'm talking about
[41:29.800 --> 41:34.760]  those i'm talking about the other white victims the other cracker asses uh we need we need you
[41:34.760 --> 41:39.480]  know those that this has happened to to to go down there in solidarity and come out of the
[41:39.480 --> 41:45.640]  closet for being white and apologize you know apologize in fact i think they should arrest
[41:45.640 --> 41:50.280]  the two white hippies they got beat up and stomped and robbed because when the when the guys fist
[41:50.280 --> 41:55.720]  and feet hit them that was a cracker assaulting a god you understand that oh absolutely i i think
[41:55.720 --> 42:02.360]  the folks that beat up the white fellas should wear shirts that say racist on them and that way
[42:02.360 --> 42:12.840]  we can stop out racism but racism only comes in the form of the cracker or hockey maybe we could
[42:12.840 --> 42:18.920]  have the band honky meet us down there as well uh at the police station uh any members of the band
[42:18.920 --> 42:24.120]  honky local austin band honky if there you go with all your band stuff okay thank you john bound

[44:23.640 --> 44:30.920]  proves government cannot protect you man penetrates multi-million dollar security ring with uh
[44:32.040 --> 44:37.880]  excuses and fake pass the much vaunted multi-million dollar security ring what would you do with
[44:37.880 --> 44:42.040]  somebody had a bomber a gun it's i mean security checkpoint is the place to attack folks that's
[44:42.040 --> 44:48.280]  what they do in fallujah the much vaunted million dollar security ring in place at taxpayer expense
[44:48.280 --> 44:52.920]  for this year's super bowl was easily penetrated by a man with fake pass and an excuse that he
[44:52.920 --> 44:57.880]  was late for work get another example of how government security theater cannot protect you
[44:57.880 --> 45:02.680]  in its colossal waste of money well it's not it's a domestic control grid over the tea party they
[45:02.680 --> 45:07.160]  admit that right and of course who promotes the police state the tea party thinking it's you know
[45:07.160 --> 45:14.120]  to keep us safe it's pathetic prior to the big game the authorities the public servants boasted of
[45:14.120 --> 45:20.120]  their lavish preparations for super bowl 2014 bomb sniffing dogs 700 extra troopers 24 hour fbi
[45:20.120 --> 45:24.200]  command center and the vast network of surveillance cameras and see something say something snitch
[45:24.200 --> 45:29.320]  program in full force so the man saw something he said something tsa agents snipers no fly zones
[45:29.320 --> 45:34.680]  helicopter patrols the bill for all of this which ran to the tens of millions of dollars was paid for
[45:34.680 --> 45:39.320]  by taxpayers despite the nfl already getting a sales tax break for a further cost of 8 million
[45:39.320 --> 45:45.160]  to residents of new jersey also remember the nfl is tax exempt and pays no federal income tax on
[45:45.160 --> 45:54.360]  its fast profits however the 30 year old matthew williams my hero made a mockery mills however the
[45:54.360 --> 45:59.720]  30 year old matthew mills made a mockery of all this when he crashed a post game press conference
[45:59.720 --> 46:05.160]  to tell the viewing millions the 911 attacks were perpetrated by people in our own government
[46:05.160 --> 46:10.680]  urging them to investigate 911 before being dragged away how did mills penetrate the fearsome ring of
[46:10.680 --> 46:16.600]  steel no one even checked jacari jackson's ticket or scanned it by the way or josh owens when they
[46:16.600 --> 46:21.080]  went around shooting videos news videos everywhere around the metlife stadium he used a fake pass
[46:21.080 --> 46:25.880]  from an old music festival and claimed he was late for work mills hopped on board an employee
[46:25.880 --> 46:30.600]  bus headed for the stadium just like i did bohemian grove and relied on the same excuse just
[46:30.600 --> 46:35.800]  like i did at bohemian grove every time he was confronted by security i just said i was running
[46:35.800 --> 46:42.120]  late for work he told uh new jersey dot com it was that simple folks here's the bottom line
[46:42.120 --> 46:49.160]  people think my infiltration of bohemian grove was fake because cbs news tried it people magazine
[46:49.160 --> 46:54.440]  tried it vanity fair tried it got arrested that's because they try to go up and interview people
[46:54.440 --> 47:03.400]  and ask questions like a cocky reporter i snuck in and i did research on the place and knew about
[47:03.400 --> 47:08.040]  some of the internal clubs and then still got questioned by secret service and sheriff deputies
[47:08.040 --> 47:15.880]  three times and then went and hid under uh with my cancer and stuck in with me underneath planks
[47:16.680 --> 47:20.360]  for an hour while the cops looked for us because they had surveillance cameras then we crawled out
[47:20.360 --> 47:26.920]  at dusk got the video of the ritual and got out and it's a testament to what you can do i mean i
[47:26.920 --> 47:32.280]  infiltrated delta force operations when they were doing takeover drills and had them at gunpoint
[47:32.280 --> 47:37.960]  take our video one time and by the way i've been told by high-level special forces people
[47:37.960 --> 47:43.160]  they're even retired that i'm quote a legend because i did that a couple times four or five
[47:43.160 --> 47:48.600]  times because no one would ever do that i'm a legend quote in special forces because i would
[47:48.600 --> 47:53.480]  sneak into operations big deal i knew they were doing narcotics trafficking drills i had inside
[47:53.480 --> 47:58.600]  sources i had police chiefs giving me intel senatorial police chief it's all in video
[47:59.720 --> 48:07.720]  what just because i showed up and did something i'm nobody but i'm somebody just like this guy
[48:07.720 --> 48:13.240]  infiltrated and did this and they're going to come after him you watch because they're scared of this
[48:13.240 --> 48:18.600]  folks they're scared of what we do going and confronting janet rino and hillary clinton
[48:18.600 --> 48:23.000]  barack obama and george w bush when he had me arrested as governor for simply asking about the
[48:23.000 --> 48:26.120]  fellow reserve being private and saying aren't you going to do something governor at the end of
[48:26.120 --> 48:29.720]  his speech i knew his prepared speech they were supposed to have a press conference they canceled
[48:29.720 --> 48:32.600]  the press conference i'd seen a bunch of his speeches he said and that's what we're going to
[48:32.600 --> 48:37.080]  do for texas they clapped he was getting ready to leave and i said governor he knew me my sister
[48:37.080 --> 48:42.520]  went to school with his daughters i've had lunch with bush multiple times when he was governor
[48:44.040 --> 48:49.320]  years before in his first term or whatever in fact i knew him before he was governor
[48:49.320 --> 48:52.520]  no he didn't know him well but i've eaten barbecue with him in mexican food i think three times
[48:53.480 --> 48:57.080]  i looked at him and i was told by insiders he watched my access show every week and listened
[48:57.080 --> 49:01.560]  to my radio show and they all knew who i was he directed the state police the texas rangers to
[49:01.560 --> 49:08.760]  grab me and almost break my arm it's all on video why i didn't do anything wrong they're afraid of

[54:44.360 --> 54:49.720]  to the governor hadn't been on it about two or three months andrew in pennsylvania you want to
[54:49.720 --> 54:55.480]  talk about sports being rigged my friend go ahead yeah from a philadelphia sports standpoint hey the
[54:55.480 --> 55:00.440]  day before the philadelphia philies won the 2008 world series bud ceiling was asked on baseball
[55:00.440 --> 55:05.400]  tonight the baseball commissioner what if we have to go to tampa and bud ceiling said oh i don't think
[55:05.400 --> 55:09.160]  we'll be going anywhere suggesting he knew the philies were going to win and the second piece
[55:09.160 --> 55:13.480]  of evidence that philies sports was rigged was because before the philies won the 2008 world
[55:13.480 --> 55:19.480]  series we went through massive suffering for 25 years before the sixers won the 1983 world championship
[55:19.480 --> 55:22.920]  and a mathematics professor determined that the probability that philies sports could have gone
[55:22.920 --> 55:29.080]  that long without winning a title was 150700 and i emailed brian toey about this and he suggested
[55:29.080 --> 55:33.240]  hey i there is evidence to suggest that they would toy around with philies sports fans and by the
[55:33.240 --> 55:39.960]  way i want to get brian telly uh author of the fixes in on tomorrow guys i want to get him on
[55:39.960 --> 55:46.200]  about that game but i mean you know i'm not saying it's all rigged but key plays key players are
[55:46.200 --> 55:52.360]  gotten to that's come out that's why your ticket says it's for entertainment purposes only uh but
[55:52.360 --> 55:58.120]  i tell you if it was rigged they did a bad job because nobody wanted to watch that near shutout
[55:58.120 --> 56:03.800]  crampling of the broncos and again all the reason i'm covering football is that's how we get the
[56:03.800 --> 56:10.040]  general public to think about how manipulated we are but uh i just wish people go in their burning
[56:10.040 --> 56:15.080]  houses for their freedom not for an xbox i wish people would you know riot for the bill of rights
[56:15.080 --> 56:20.840]  and constitution i don't want them to actually riot but my point is it's so ridiculous to do that
[56:20.840 --> 56:24.840]  and i just say good job to the guy in fact let's play that clip thanks for the call bro here's the
[56:24.840 --> 56:32.920]  fella uh who actually took over during the mbp press conference with 9 11 was an inside job here's
[56:32.920 --> 56:37.880]  that clip no i always imagine myself making great plays but you never think about being a vp
[56:41.240 --> 56:45.160]  investigate 9 11 and 9 11 was perpetrated by people within our own government
[56:47.240 --> 56:52.600]  boom short sweet got the job done by the way we're going to be getting him on the broadcast
[56:52.600 --> 56:57.800]  today or tomorrow i want him on this radio show we've got his contact info and we're working on

[57:11.800 --> 57:16.520]  hey alex can you hear me okay yes sir brother go ahead great uh yeah i have to agree with you that
[57:16.520 --> 57:23.720]  the uh nfl is pretty much a zombification of people in the united states uh they care more
[57:23.720 --> 57:30.440]  about the game than they do for their own individual rights and you know if you listen to the president
[57:30.440 --> 57:36.280]  speech the other night the state of the union he lays out his game plan of what he's going to do
[57:37.000 --> 57:43.880]  you know he you know this is a you know forecoming of what he plans to do bypassing congress and so
[57:43.880 --> 57:49.800]  forth but you know i wish people would get like you said just as excited about you know what the
[57:49.800 --> 57:57.720]  president's going to do and protest that as they do for a football game so i don't know alex i totally
[57:57.720 --> 58:03.160]  agree with you but i mean in every case in history in an authoritarian collapse sports become just
[58:03.160 --> 58:07.640]  absolutely king but i think we're starting to hit the bottom of this or the top of it as they say
[58:07.640 --> 58:13.400]  because ticket sales are down people are sick of it viewerships down and i mean just the parade of
[58:13.400 --> 58:18.760]  government acting like they're heroes with machine guns but citizens shouldn't have guns in new jersey
[58:18.760 --> 58:27.160]  but but government can't i mean give me a break great points paul ronnie and many others your phone

[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:43.320]  here is part of the clip no i always imagine myself making great plays but you never think
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:51.480]  about being a vp investigate 911 a 911 was perpetrated by people within our own government
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:57.400]  and again that simple statement and then they're freaking out in their response all over the news
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:03.000]  last night and today this is all over every news channel causing a giant debate it shows that number
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.400]  one their fake security is a complete fraud with the gunships and the groping and the checkpoints
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:13.080]  governor great to have you back with us thanks alex great to be here jeez i i watched the super bowl
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:19.400]  from off the grid i was able to watch the game yesterday and uh unfortunately i went back home
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:27.400]  and i didn't see the mvp presentation by the way just for my note who did win the mvp uh who did
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:34.680]  win the vid mvp that was malcolm smith of the seahawks really okay well anyway well i knew
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:39.480]  someone from the seahawks that win because they obviously dominated the game and overwhelmingly
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:45.960]  wanted they did a great job for seattle but uh i i that's amazing that somehow somebody got that
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:51.880]  in there and that's been all over the news today that's wonderful i couldn't be happier uh tip by
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:57.160]  half to that gentleman that had the courage to do that and get people talking and thinking about
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:02.040]  stuff and getting the lemmings to wake up up there well it shows governor as you know the
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:09.720]  power of the individual as somebody who called national nfl games on on television and also
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:13.800]  they're locally for the fans uh what was it like for you to watch this i think this was one of the
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:21.080]  most boring super bowls ever and then watching with tsa grope people uh and and and the gunships
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:26.600]  and the snipers this did not look like america it looked like east germany and checkpoint charlie
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:33.400]  well if that's why i do my show uh you know is the fact that uh i'm outside the grid i'm outside
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:39.560]  the united states broadcasting in the because of the united states is getting like east berlin
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:44.440]  there taking away our rights and freedoms people need to understand that the constitution of the
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:50.120]  bill of rights are there to protect the people against the government those are our documents
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:56.200]  that ensure our freedom and when the government starts to violate those documents we can't allow
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:01.320]  that to happen it's that simple because that's what makes our country the great nation that it is
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:08.200]  and uh for this guy to penetrate the super bowl and be able to stay on national tv 9 11 was an
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:14.200]  inside job and now they're all up and outraged and i rate it'll it'll be interesting to see what the
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:20.280]  end result for this and the backlash of this is will will people become more aware or or but you
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:25.160]  know they're going to try to marginalize this guy and say that he's some sort of nutcase naturally
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:30.440]  well if you go up to google and put in 9 11 inside job and click news there are literally
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:36.440]  thousands of articles all over the world tv they are taking what he did kind of like when
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:42.440]  i got on pierce morgan and just putting it everywhere those 15 seconds uh literally just
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:47.080]  showed what a fraud the whole thing is what is your angle on the fact that i mean i think it shows
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:53.240]  that it's total security theater that this guy was able to do that well it shows how vulnerable
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:58.840]  everything is though to alex because you think at the super bowl you know that would be a lockdown
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:04.680]  situation how protected was the super bowl yesterday they really had helicopters flying
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:10.040]  around and was it was it truly that difficult to get in would you have to go through three metal
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:15.000]  detectives let me break it down jacari jackson our reporter along with our camera guy put a
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.320]  leader cameras behind obviously that were there for three days before and during covering it
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:25.720]  and and i had to buy him by the time we got tickets $1700 for nosebleeds almost at the very
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:30.440]  back of that giant stadium they do not allow cabs to get within a mile of it they do not
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:38.040]  allow taxis they do not allow limos you have to get on a train and wait two hours each time on on
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:42.680]  trains people collapsed inside the train sitting there for hours in the heat because they had
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:47.240]  heaters on that was on the in the news they would then bust you and it would then take another
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:53.160]  two hours after the train gets there to go through security where they search your bags
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:58.520]  grope your body metal detector you and then do it again and then do it again as you just said
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:05.560]  but then no one ever scanned or checked their ticket ever not even getting on the train it was
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:10.920]  ultra bizarre jacari was like well wait a minute there was all the security but there was no security
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:17.160]  and there were men with machine guns everywhere police dogs snipers gunboats five helicopters
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:24.520]  uh jets flying over that were even yeah you know alex the question needs to be asked this and this
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:32.440]  is that what i believe that people need to be asking the government is why if we're indeed that
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:38.840]  vulnerable and we're really that much under attack that the united states is now turning
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:46.200]  into east berlin with its security precautions we need to ask the the million dollar question
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:54.680]  why what have we done and i'll repeat that what have we done to incur the anger of people throughout
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:16:02.040]  the world to this extent because that's what we need to be looking at what is causing people
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:10.120]  to hate the united states to the extent that they are we used to be looked up to everywhere in the
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:16.360]  world used to look up and try to emulate the united states of america they all wanted to be us you
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:22.840]  know they all wanted that but today there's nobody doing that anymore and if we have to lock down our
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:29.960]  country be for fear of attack from some unknown entities well then we need to start looking
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:35.400]  in the mirror saying what are we doing that is causing this type of behavior throughout the
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:42.280]  world because you know we certainly didn't have to protect our super bowls 20 years ago like this
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:48.280]  i mean naturally there's always been some type of security at every event but as you stated the
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:53.240]  security was to make sure people had tickets you know because it used to be had to worry about
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:59.240]  scalpers and people sneaking in well and you had real police out there who do what to look for
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:05.000]  you know what it is governor it's about training us to be slaves training us for the police state
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.960]  training us for a lockdown america during a financial collapse why do you think they're
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:14.760]  setting up what i would call classical incremental martial law what do you think it's in preparation
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:21.320]  for jesse ventura well it it troubles me greatly because obviously somebody feels there's going to
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:27.880]  be a need for martial law that's right i can't for the life of me figure out if our society is what
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:33.960]  we deem it to be why there would ever be a need for martial law what in the united states of america
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:40.600]  you know people need to wake up and realize that they have a each of us as individuals
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:45.640]  have about as much chance of being attacked by a terrorist as we do winning the power ball
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:52.920]  and yet we're preparing like some sort of al-qaeda invasion of normandy is going to happen
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:18:00.680]  virginia beach virginia and it's it's insane and i have to agree with the alex the people in the
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:05.800]  know must be preparing for something that they sure don't want us to know about because this
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:12.680]  lockdown of america over over 9 11 and over the patriot act is utterly absurd it's time to get rid
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:18.760]  of the patriarch and take the country back to what it used to be instead of this police state that
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:24.200]  turning it into my issue is is they just keep accelerating it to where more and more it sounds
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:29.160]  like a good idea to leave the country like you've done shifting gears i believe as you've said
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:35.800]  getting off the grid becoming self-sufficient that's how you make sure you can't be domesticated this
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:40.600]  system wants you on food stamps it wants you dependent it wants you scared not having your
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:45.720]  own guns with police all around with guns they want us domesticated so i want to spend a few
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:50.760]  minutes before we get back into the news and this latest overdose and the heroine out of afghanistan
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:54.760]  i want to ask governor jesse ventura because i had a lot of fun being on your show last week
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:59.480]  uh uncensored uh and it was just great i was on skype you're on skype felt like i was there in
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:04.680]  the room with you spend a few minutes talking about some of the uh the shows you're doing
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:09.480]  it i mean you're doing them what four days a week at least and some of the stuff that's coming up
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:13.720]  because i mean this is the type of show that i personally am going to be watching well it's
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:19.720]  it's fun for me alex because as you know since i left office i've had a very difficult time
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:26.760]  i'm getting my message out there uh you stated earlier fox news won't have me on msnbc won't
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:34.040]  have me on cnn allows me on a little bit my last book because it dealt with the kennedy killing
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:40.920]  none of the major networks would have me on not nbc not abc not cbs fox none of them and
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:46.520]  i've always since i got out of office in two up two oh three when i had that uh
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:52.440]  uh debolical that happened at ns msnbc where they wouldn't put me on the air because i opposed the
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:58.280]  war in iraq and they paid me for three years and literally handcuffed me and kept me off the air
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:03.720]  since then i've been fighting to find a way how can i talk to the american people unfiltered how
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:09.560]  can i talk to the american people without it being on these stations that decide whether i can come
[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:16.440]  on or not and uh ora dot com has come forward and it actually happened while i was on a book tour i did
[01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:21.880]  larry king and i thought larry had retired you know i thought larry left cnn i didn't know that he
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:26.280]  was on the internet well i said larry what are you doing he said oh i'm on the internet you need
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:32.200]  to be on this and that's how it all started or a tv does larry king and they got interested then
[01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:37.240]  and me and they felt i was a voice that needed to be heard and the important thing is the owner of
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:43.800]  the company is not from the united states of america so therefore he has no dog in the fight
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:50.600]  when i want to criticize our policy and be a uh an engaged american citizen and be vigilant uh
[01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:55.800]  term that i've been using from the start that i like to assume president obama stole from me
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:03.160]  for the uh state of the union address because lo and behold he also used the term vigilant and uh
[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:07.960]  this show is offered me that ability and to be able to and i thought to myself you know
[01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:13.240]  i've been inside the united states yelling and screaming from the inside out nobody seems to
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:19.000]  want to listen maybe it'll work better from the outside going in so that's what it's done for me
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:25.800]  doing this show i can't tell you how happy i am uncensored any topics i want to talk about
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:31.800]  and of course it's on the internet so shows are roughly only eight to twelve minutes long because
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:37.160]  that's the style of the internet they're more quick hits you're not going to have an hour hour and a
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:41.880]  half long show that's going to work that well i don't think so it works out terrific for me
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:48.040]  and it lets me live in sheer freedom down here and we'll be moving it about to the show alex
[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:53.000]  we don't want them to get a pinpoint on us we don't want them finding us with drones so we'll
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:59.880]  be doing the show different locations off the grid we'll keep them desperate well it's just really
[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:04.920]  exciting the revolution of true independent media larry king when they kicked him off three years
[01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:10.360]  ago had two million listeners viewers a nine pierce morgan and i know you know him he has you on
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:16.760]  you know it's down about 400 000 msnbc has gone from a million down about 300 000 i mean back when
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:22.120]  you were on msnbc they had five million viewers ten million viewers some nights mainstream media
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:27.480]  isn't just dying because of the internet uh because my show is just exploding and many others are
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:32.760]  it's the content but they're still i mean larry king wasn't controllable enough for them
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:38.120]  so they got him off seeing in and it just shows what are you jesse ventura you're a smart guy
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:44.040]  you're savvy where do you see the media wars going where do you see the establishment going
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:50.520]  where do you see uh just you know all the new banker bailouts all the corruption what is your gut
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:56.600]  about uh where the future of humanity is going well you know to me when you're talking communications
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:02.920]  it's the internet i mean i think you know it's taking over so strong now that's why i'm on it
[01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:08.120]  uh the freedom of being on it and you can rest assured the government is going to try to get
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:13.960]  control of it they've got to from their perspective if they're going to control us they got to control
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:20.120]  the internet i personally hope they never ever get control of it i love the freedom of it it falls
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:25.080]  right under freedom of speech our first amendment and the bill of rights we have the right to speak
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:32.200]  freely and the bill of rights freedom of speech as i've said so often it's there to protect unpopular
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:37.800]  speech because popular speech doesn't need protected it's unpopular speech that needs to
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:44.600]  protect us right or or speech that goes against the status quo it may be minority speech you're
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:52.360]  talking about you excuse me something that the majority doesn't necessarily can control and
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:58.360]  that's what's important about the internet well that's right alex i think the internet
[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:06.280]  and i'm probably being very liberal here i see the internet taking over all communications
[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:12.200]  within a decade oh i agree totally no i i think you're right maybe maybe five six years i mean
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:18.280]  the way it's going but cyber security homeland security they admit with big media they want to
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:26.680]  censor it track it tax it web id it uh and geolocate it geofilter it so that they can kill
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:32.840]  competition because these guys can't compete with us governor well you know and that may be the case
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:39.240]  it's like the old saying from deep throat alex follow the money uh the money alligia you know
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:45.400]  that's money is what gets government to react money money money if there's money to be made
[01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:51.560]  government wants a piece of it on another note that will switch gears here again i want to talk
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:56.440]  about it you know and and we just make the good transition to the war on drugs that you wanted
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:02.280]  to talk about i'm so proud of the states of washington and colorado the two super bowl
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:07.720]  participants but i'm even more proud of them not for their super bowl football teams i'm proud of
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:13.160]  them because they have voted the people in those states to legalize marijuana and strike a blow
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:20.360]  against this war on drugs that in a free society should never be happening uh drug addiction
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:26.760]  should be treated medically addiction should be treated medically not criminally uh you can be
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:33.800]  addicted to anything people imagine the addiction to coffee now and that's a powerful addiction
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:38.520]  i remember when i was in the navy if you didn't make the coffee the chiefs were ready to hang
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:44.840]  you from the yard arms you know and i never drink coffee i've never been a coffee at it but when you
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:50.200]  watch people not get their morning cup of coffee and you watch how it affects them in their daily
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:57.560]  life clearly it's a powerful addiction well again addiction you can be addicted to hostess 20 for
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:02.200]  that matter exactly you're not going to arrest people for sugar though now bloomberg the outgoing
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:05.960]  mayor once said let me shift gears before we get into the drugs because i want to tie it in we're
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:09.720]  about to go to break i'm going to come back and talk about the dead actor who i was a fan of he
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:13.960]  was a great actor and this super heroine that killed him and tied in you know to how the drugs
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:17.960]  are being shipped in from afghanistan to get your take on that but since you mentioned censorship
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:23.800]  of journalism and the internet as you know we'll put the la times article on screen uh los angeles
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:30.040]  times who's a journalist senator diane feinstein wants to draw a line and literally shut down
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:36.120]  bloggers talk radio you name it and not let us have journalistic protections uh she's absolutely
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:41.960]  a monster and you've got john d rockefeller uh the senator uh from west virginia saying quote
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:47.720]  we'd be better off if the internet was never invented so i agree with you and i remember calling
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:52.360]  you the night and calling tyrell the night i've never done this on the tv show and i was involved
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:57.240]  in like at that time like 10 episodes of the of the 16 or so that had been on and i'll never
[01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:02.920]  forget calling you as a consultant and saying governor i just want to say congratulations
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:08.840]  for putting the most powerful television on ever your fema special exposes the whole takeover
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:14.520]  plan the whole plan with the fema centers i cannot believe this got on air with almost
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:21.160]  two million viewers record views for a new show on on on on true tv then congress gets involved
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:26.040]  all of it happens the way you skewered that congressman and they killed it airing again
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:30.280]  when they normally air at 50 more times so it's seen by upwards of 50 million people most rears
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:37.480]  of a million viewers incredible to to to to to see that that's so threatened the establishment
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:43.080]  that within hours they flipped out can you speak to that well it was uh i don't know if you want
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:49.320]  to call it an honor to be uh to be taken down on the congressional floor but that's what actually
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:55.880]  happened congressman cone the guy who co-sponsored the bill to build these fema camps actually
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:01.800]  chastised me and my show on the floor of the congress and i i guess i should take that for
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:09.400]  a compliment uh to get that far but you're right that show never aired again they then removed it
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:13.160]  wouldn't even acknowledge that we did it they took it off kimo they took it off the the the
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:18.600]  cable servers oh yeah they did all that so people out there that believe that we're not already
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:25.320]  being operated under a certain censorship are naive and sadly mistaken and they better wake up to
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:31.800]  the fact that you know even a show like mine when it comes out and tells the truth on on a particular
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:37.800]  subject if it if it offends too many of the status quo and the government they'll step in and do
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:43.000]  what they did to that show and basically remove it so that more people can't ever see it but it's
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:48.600]  still out there because the great thing about the internet today is once it's showing once
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:52.600]  it's going to be somewhere well we're going to break but i want to come back and get into the

[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:04.920]  governor jesse ventura who i just admire so much because he's a trailblazer like ron paul he never
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:10.120]  has compromised he's the real deal and that's why the media tries to attack him and say oh he's not
[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:14.920]  the real deal because just like to do with ran paul and people because he is the real deal and i
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:20.120]  want to read this quote before we get into the drug war and the fact that jesse ventura wouldn't
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:26.360]  be censored on msnbc and you know uh turned down his top rated he had the top rated show on there
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:30.120]  and they got rid of the other guy that had a top rated show donahue and they got they're getting rid
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:35.480]  of everybody and and remember these are real people that these networks could win with but they
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:41.160]  they cannot allow the idea of legalizing freedom but i want to read a famous quote about the man
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:45.960]  in the arena and i want all of you to pledge to be men and women in the arena this is by a former
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:50.760]  president at the time he just been out of office in 1910 teddy roosevelt it's the man in the arena
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:56.200]  citizenship in a republic it's not the critic who counts not the man who points out how
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:01.080]  the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to
[01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:06.440]  the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust sweat and blood who strives valiantly
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:11.320]  who airs and comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:16.360]  but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows the great enthusiasm the great devotions
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:21.160]  who spends himself in a worthy cause and who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:27.240]  and who at worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:33.320]  with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat and governor i want your take
[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:39.000]  on that quote and your philosophy on life then we're going to get into the fake drug war well i
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:44.280]  i agree totally with that uh it's what you do in your life and how you conduct it and you don't
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:52.040]  have to be a big national leader if you just live day to day and stay a vigilant citizen but focus
[01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:58.440]  on what's happening locally in your local school board what happens in your local town and and
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:03.480]  remain active because those are the heroes that make the united states the great country it is
[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:09.880]  are the everyday citizens that take part in in the creation of this great country and keeping
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:16.200]  it running like it is and alex we're just lucky that we were the people that seem to have a voice
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:22.360]  and can be heard but we really need the millions and millions out there to stand up and finally
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:27.640]  be counted because if they don't do that we're going to lose our great country and and it's not
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:32.360]  going to be the country that you and i were born in it's certainly not the country that i was born
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:37.160]  in and uh the way it's the direction it's heading for me today it's not the country that i want to
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:43.480]  die in and i would like to get it back to being the country i would like to die in someday well
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:47.640]  that's right and you've said that if people get behind a national movement to have you run for
[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:52.120]  president if they get it lined up and show enough interest then you'll do it but you can't do everything
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:57.320]  a guy two weeks ago ran into a burning house to get his xbox and that same week a guy wouldn't
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:02.760]  run in his house to get his kids and i and i think about people rioting and burning things and
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:10.680]  jumping over cars and attacking police in seattle when the seahawks won you know i wish people would
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:16.920]  show not that energy for rioting but that same energy politically for freedom what's your take
[01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:21.960]  on that governor i agree you know people need to get more motivated let's remember something
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:27.640]  football is nothing more than entertainment and that's the real problem with our country today
[01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:33.720]  we have become an entertainment society now where entertainment is the most important thing in our
[01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:39.240]  lives and if they look at history they'll find out that's exactly what happened to the roman empire
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:45.880]  or they they became enhanced with entertainment entertainment became the main focus and uh
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:51.720]  you know football's grade sports is terrific and being entertained is a wonderful thing but if you
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:59.720]  break your day up we need to get back concentrating on the real things and life you know it used to be
[01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:06.040]  you concentrated on working an eight or ten hour day today that's the sideline what people focus on
[01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:11.480]  today is how do i entertain myself that other four to six hours when i'm not working and i'm not
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:19.320]  sleeping and we need to make take more pride in our work and more pride in being uh involved in our
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:25.880]  communities helping people out you know i often laugh because you hear you hear stories about you
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:31.480]  know i'm an admitted atheist now and uh you hear stories about well atheists they can't they don't
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:37.960]  have values yes we do and and it's the value of every day treating your fellow man the old golden
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:43.160]  rule treat people the way you would want to be treated and go out there and get involved help
[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:48.200]  people there's nothing more gratifying in the world than helping someone and you don't need money in
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:53.160]  which to do it well and you know i respect the fact that we agree on about 95 of stuff but i
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:58.680]  totally get the fact that the churches are so evil and so hypocritical and are a bunch of
[01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:03.880]  Pharisees i don't blame people running the opposite direction from these institutions and i know
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:09.800]  you're a moral person who genuinely cares about humanity uh from a human perspective and i admire
[01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:13.480]  that and that's what it's all about the people that shake their finger at each other and just
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:19.640]  want to infight over religion uh you know are the hypocrites and if they let a better example out there
[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:23.320]  you know people wouldn't see them for the disgusting hypocrites they are now shifting
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:28.360]  gears again you mentioned the drug war what a battle with all 14 states trying to decriminalize
[01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:34.360]  or legalize marijuana obama doing all the raids uh whatever happened to states rights obama claimed
[01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:39.160]  he was gonna decriminalize marijuana another lie give us your take on what i cut you off about
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:44.520]  before the break and then i want to tie it into this actor who had heroin laced with painkiller
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:50.680]  i can't pronounce this how do you say it fentanyl uh takes toll on pennsylvania killing people
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:56.360]  and they're also getting almost pure heroin out of afghanistan 10 fold increase on heroin going
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:42:02.760]  into western europe in the u.s since the liberation of afghanistan 12 years ago philip seamore hoffman
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:08.680]  was found dead in new york city with a needle in his arm and i'm just like mike adams has a great
[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:14.280]  article in natural news dot com it's also an info wars dot com overdose death of hoffman underscores
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:19.480]  urgent need to decriminalize and regulate recreational drugs northern europe five countries
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:25.160]  there have decriminalized heroin so you can get medical grade in controlled dosages and almost
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:30.360]  no overdoses are happening now and drug use has gone down about 50 percent because you take the
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:35.400]  black market out of it everything you've said governor give us your take on all this absolutely
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:43.080]  you know when it's like my mother said to me my my mom passed away back in 1995 but she lived through
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:49.560]  the prohibition of alcohol when they went through that nonsense way back in the 20s and early 30s
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:55.640]  where they prohibited alcohol and my mom's observation was she told me she said the war on drugs is
[01:42:55.640 --> 01:43:01.240]  identical to the prohibition of alcohol all you're doing is making criminals rich and powerful
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:07.880]  and that's precisely it clearly some people within our government are profiting greatly
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:15.480]  from keeping drugs illegal by smuggling them in the prices are then 10 times higher than they
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:21.240]  normally be i mean let's look at tobacco and alcohol those two are drugs there's no doubt
[01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:27.240]  about it but for some reason they separate them from all the other ones because that number one
[01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:34.200]  they're legal well tobacco and alcohol causes much damage or more damage than all the quote
[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:40.840]  illegal drugs do combine more people die from alcohol and tobacco every year than what die
[01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:47.800]  from any of these other drugs in fact illegal drugs medical prescription drugs more people die
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:55.080]  from those overdoses of drugs you get from your doctor then die from these alleged illegal
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:44:03.000]  recreational drugs and the point of the matter is if you live in a free society drug addiction
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:10.760]  is a medical problem why we have chose to make it a criminal problem i have no idea why we somehow
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:17.960]  think you should take an addict and throw them in prison is beyond me you can achieve so much more
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:26.360]  by legalizing it taxing it using those revenues then you get a hold on who the who the addicts are
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:32.520]  and you can attempt to cure them you can attempt to make them good you know uh citizens who are
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:40.440]  productive again and what and they won't have to be out facing buying addictive substances
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:46.680]  that are charged 10 times more than what they should cost and that leads to other crimes
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:53.240]  if an addict has to fill his fulfills addiction and the price is 10 times you don't see people
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:59.960]  robbing stores at gunpoint to get money for tobacco and alcohol well the same thing would hold
[01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:07.400]  true if the other drugs are put at a decent price you put them in hospitals and in pharmacies and
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:13.320]  places you don't sell them in 711 stores but you put them in places where people can come admit
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:20.200]  their addiction be able to buy what they need then you at least get a grasp on okay now can we
[01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:26.920]  wean this person off of the drug and i think that in nine times out of 10 the addict would go for
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:33.000]  that the addict would go to stop being controlled by this drug but the only way that's going to
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:38.680]  happen is through legalization it's not going to happen through prohibition and people need to wake
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:43.960]  up to that fact that could be a university dissertation i know you taught at harvard that
[01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:50.120]  was perfectly said with all the facts i mean look at prohibition ending uh you know in the early
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:57.000]  30s and the police had been corrupted alcoholism had tripled uh billions had been made by the mafia
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:02.360]  and and corrupt groups and joe kennedy and so they literally went and lobbied the well-meaning
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:07.960]  christian pts and people to go all over the country and get drug laws state and federal passed
[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:12.920]  where they'd put you in jail for 20 years for a marijuana cigarette so that they had something
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:17.960]  new to deal and then women need it because it's so expensive so they become prostitutes
[01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:23.320]  and the and the local government thugs can run that i mean this is all a racket and everybody
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:29.880]  knows it and i don't see how long the drug war can go as the public all the polls show
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:35.160]  want decriminalization across the board jessie well then what you've got to do alex is simple
[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:41.080]  you have to start electing people that agree with that position i i remember when i ran for governor
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:47.560]  of minnesota during the election i brought out i made a simple statement i said it's time to look
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:54.280]  at legalizing drugs and prostitution oh my god the head of the of the uh independent party of
[01:46:54.280 --> 01:47:00.520]  minnesota went ballistic she thought i had blown the whole election she goes oh we were contending
[01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:06.360]  now he opened his mouth on drugs and prostitution we're going to lose the election it's all lost
[01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:11.960]  and i'll never forget my partner dean parkley who was who was instrumental in getting me to run for
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:18.520]  governor dean walked into the room and sat down and smiled very calmly and says look how do we take
[01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:25.000]  this lemon and turn it into lemonade and he came up with a great idea and it worked he said we're
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:30.120]  going to come out through with the position jessie ventura is the only candidate with the courage to
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:37.800]  talk about these real issues because drug addiction is real prostitution is real and he's not afraid to
[01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:44.440]  discuss real life situations and what the regular public but i mean exactly there's there's women
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:49.320]  everywhere that you take them out to dinner and you pay their bills they don't call that prostitution
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:54.440]  and and and what makes it horrible and i'm not endorsing it is the fact that there are pimps it
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:48:00.440]  is illegal these women are being suppressed by it being a black market and all the studies show that
[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:07.400]  oh absolutely well alex when you look at prostitution and you strip it all away okay in our free
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:15.800]  society any sexual act between two consenting adults is legal so the only illegality about
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:23.160]  prostitution the government's not getting the cut they're not paying taxes the government wants to be
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:29.880]  the pimp they need their cut and so you know that that's all part of it to follow the money how
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:36.440]  the sex act itself is not illegal so clearly it's the money and then you run into a different
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:45.240]  scenario let's take a pornographic actor someone who does pornography on tv for money is that not
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:52.120]  having sex for money how is it they're not arrested is that not considered prostitution
[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:57.640]  they're having sex and they're getting paid to do it it's just that they're doing it on film
[01:48:57.640 --> 01:49:03.880]  so i guess it's considered an artistic form well said well i mean bottom line is pornography is not
[01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:09.720]  illegal and prostitution is how could how can that be well i just know all the studies from
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:16.600]  around the world it's incontrovertible you make something illegal uh that's a vice uh that that
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:22.680]  that doesn't hurt non-consenting people you then make it dark make it corrupt make it black market
[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:29.320]  put tons of money into it and now the mafia and the corrupt government and the police get to run it
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:35.480]  and that's why they want illegal so that they can run it on the dark side period well and it's also
[01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:41.880]  so that the prices will go off that's right anything that's legal the price drops you watch
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:48.440]  in colorado and washington how eventually the price of marijuana is going to drop there where
[01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:55.240]  it's legal because there will be competition there will be growers of marijuana who will decide you
[01:49:55.240 --> 01:50:02.040]  know what i'll undercut the price and i'll sell more then because my marijuana will be cheaper
[01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:09.160]  and that's called good clean competition in capitalism that's what drives prices down
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:15.320]  is competition and if they're and by legalizing marijuana and then let's look at it from a
[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:23.240]  different standpoint for those that think jessie might be crazy or alex is crazy marijuana itself
[01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:31.080]  is the best that you can get for creating biodiesel fuel and then we can stop using corn and use
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:35.320]  marijuana and let corn be what it's supposed to that's right him grows everywhere as well and most
[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:40.040]  strains don't even have thc final segment with jessie ventura and we've got the exclusive i'll

[01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:39.000]  and just those 15 seconds have now become a sensation all over the news as they attack him but
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:43.240]  as it causes the debate i'm going to hold him a little bit in the next hour after governor jesse
[01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:49.320]  ventura leaves us but jesse uh he's a listener he's been able to get in and we're going to
[01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:54.120]  talk to matthew mills what do you want to say to him governor well matthew i want to say you know
[01:54:54.120 --> 01:55:00.920]  unbelievable the courage you show and i and good for you to speak your mind uh i would ask this
[01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:05.800]  question of what are they going to do to you or what are they doing to you for what you just did
[01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:12.280]  all right am i on here right now yes you are yeah go ahead sir i don't think they're going to do
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:17.640]  much to me i only got like a summon the ticket i don't even think it's uh for that much money
[01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:22.360]  they grilled me for a while they were really really intense uh it was pretty much everything
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:28.040]  but the spotlight in my face they were real uh the one guy actually uh said he wanted to punch
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:32.920]  me in my jaw uh so they were kind of mad but i don't think i'm going to get in any big trouble
[01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:38.840]  well that's that's amazing uh what's been the repercussion for you are there either media
[01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:45.400]  that want to talk to you or are they marginalizing you and not talking to you well i got kind of
[01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:50.360]  i got a bunch of calls yesterday but i was in the holding cell in the stadium until pretty late
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:54.840]  at night until pretty much the stadium closed and i had a bunch of texts and calls and then
[01:55:54.840 --> 01:56:01.640]  one guy i finally answered is from nj.com and uh he just asked me some questions and i was candid
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:07.480]  with him that's right you got interviewed by the uh new jersey uh a local paper there uh in the
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:11.240]  main city listen can you hold and after the governor leaves us i'm going to come back and
[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:16.040]  debrief you on air sure all right thank you for calling in our listener taking action
[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:20.120]  he's done work with we are changing the past as well and he is one hell of an info warrior
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:24.360]  i tell you it's great to be part of this family of freedom fighters jessie oh i'll tell you this
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:30.200]  kid had courage and guts to do what he did and uh that's remarkable because just those simple words
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:35.800]  he said and now the media jumping all over it is bringing it back into the forefront back to the
[01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:41.560]  attention of the people of throughout the world which is a good thing because we've never gotten
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:46.680]  resolution on 9 11 just as we've never gotten it on the murder of john tenney and that's enough
[01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:51.800]  of this crap we deserve to know the truth oh by the way uh i went to dallas the dallas police
[01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:55.800]  didn't didn't follow the orders of the mayor to have anybody handing out flyers anywhere
[01:56:55.800 --> 01:57:00.840]  downtown to be arrested so they hired homeland security hard sheriff's deputies to basically

[01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:51.400]  that it's not true and i and i always tell people it's the most important thing because
[01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:57.720]  that's what's led to where we're at today and jack kennedy lived i believe we would be living in a
[01:57:57.720 --> 01:58:03.320]  different world than what we live in today uh they killed everybody that stood for peace
[01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:08.360]  because obviously there are people in the world that do not want peace they want war and it's

[02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:47.960]  decided to go to the press room and and as far as the summit it doesn't say a mount on here i don't
[02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:52.760]  know what i owe it says a court appearance is not required so it doesn't seem like it's really
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:58.360]  that and what are they claiming you did it's criminal trespassing and i'm banned from the
[02:12:58.360 --> 02:13:03.400]  middle ends for life and apparently i'm banned from the nfl for life uh and nfl is going to be
[02:13:03.400 --> 02:13:08.440]  getting in contact with me about some security issues maybe um yeah they're just going to try to
[02:13:08.440 --> 02:13:13.560]  use that data in case they want to sue you i wouldn't talk to them to get a lawyer and i would you
[02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:17.080]  know they say no court appearance needed well that's because they don't want you to challenge it
[02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:22.600]  go challenge uh the trespass and just say that you know you the truth you wanted in there wanting
[02:13:22.600 --> 02:13:27.560]  to ask real questions that a citizen journalist they let you in and uh there's you know they
[02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:33.480]  didn't have no trespassing signs that that's their issue did you buy a ticket to get in period i bought
[02:13:33.480 --> 02:13:38.520]  no ticket yeah they might try something then but it doesn't matter you have to fight it in court
[02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:43.000]  you do not want a criminal trespass that could be a felony they just don't want you to know that so
[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:52.120]  i i would get counsel okay i will and yes so i mean that's that i mean first describe how you
[02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:57.000]  got through the uh multi-billion dollar security because it's tens of millions they spent on this
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:04.120]  but this is a billion dollar fraud system they've built i mean describe it i just use the uh line
[02:14:04.120 --> 02:14:10.840]  of i'm late for work and i have no time to talk and i just had that attitude and i've got i got
[02:14:10.840 --> 02:14:15.480]  by five gates but the same thing which is true you're you're the doing the work of the lord
[02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:22.200]  trace space asking real questions you know yeah yeah yeah so then i got in and it was cool because
[02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:26.600]  you know i got to see the Super Bowl which are you know i got to keep paying man he's kind of a cool
[02:14:26.600 --> 02:14:31.720]  guy and so that was fun and that's why i spent the time in there and i asked people all so you
[02:14:31.720 --> 02:14:35.960]  met Peyton Manning no i didn't meet Peyton Manning the whole time i was in there i was asking people
[02:14:35.960 --> 02:14:39.960]  about the Illuminati symbolism with the last few Super Bowls but they erased all that footage so i
[02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:45.480]  need to get all that footage back that's all i was doing and then and then you know the opportunity
[02:14:45.480 --> 02:14:50.440]  arose where i got to go in the front room and then the MVP came out and i was right there so
[02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:54.680]  i said that's it and i did it you know the secret when you're doing something like this
[02:14:54.680 --> 02:15:01.400]  is you have a loop of of electrical tape in your pocket and then you put the SD card on that and
[02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:07.080]  literally stick it on the inside of your underwear and then you have another SD card you keep using
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:11.080]  and then hiding them in your underwear because even a basic frisk they won't find them that's
[02:15:11.080 --> 02:15:15.720]  how you get out with the footage that's a really good idea that's what just a little loop of tape
[02:15:15.720 --> 02:15:20.120]  you put on the outside of the underwear whatever i tend to say the inside and you can just literally
[02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:24.520]  stick it around your waistband and have the SD cards right there that's how you get over the enemy
[02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:32.680]  cool so uh keep breaking down so so like always sees you you know go off the stage what happens
[02:15:32.680 --> 02:15:38.200]  next well they they got me and they grabbed me by the shirt and they say come over here where's your
[02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:42.280]  past they they opened on my jacket they saw i had this other past they said what is this where is
[02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:46.280]  your past i thought i don't have a past it said how'd you get in i said i just came in i just
[02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:51.240]  walked in they said who let you in i said the two guys out there they just let me in uh and then
[02:15:51.240 --> 02:15:56.520]  they said uh you know how'd you get in i said i took it to the super bowl so i was still lying to
[02:15:56.520 --> 02:16:03.960]  them at that point uh and um i would just tell them it's part of your obama care you're giving
[02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:08.280]  free tickets by obama go ahead yes so maybe i shouldn't have lied like that so i was still
[02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:12.360]  seeing i got in the super bowl they said where's your ticket i said my girlfriend has it i did
[02:16:12.360 --> 02:16:18.120]  the where's your girl i said her phone's dead uh and then they took me back uh i was i was back in the
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:26.520]  uh but i guess free synced down there in meadow and met my stadium and they called my girlfriend
[02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:32.680]  because they found her number on my phone and she had no idea any of this was going on so she
[02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:38.120]  just totally spilled the beans so then i just came clean with everything um and that was that and
[02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:43.080]  they were pretty they were pretty angry uh back there they were very sbis they had these two guys
[02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:48.440]  they're brooklyn accent owner gentlemen seem like you know something like uh law and order
[02:16:48.440 --> 02:16:53.080]  type thing they were merry like uh i love how all the see you were seeing some of the footage you
[02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:58.600]  were able to upload uh before they got your card you know later at night and just all the security
[02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:03.240]  people are just acting like they're so powerful and like they're all little secret agents meanwhile
[02:17:03.240 --> 02:17:09.160]  their bosses the government stage 9 11 runs al qaeda publicly hey how do you feel being a 9 11
[02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:16.280]  truth or now that it's so public that our government runs al qaeda and is giving them weapons and
[02:17:16.280 --> 02:17:21.320]  protecting them all over the world so that they can continue all these wars and have no bid contracts
[02:17:21.320 --> 02:17:26.840]  i mean we're totally vindicated here one of the cops that was that was taking my information
[02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:30.600]  was a 9 11 truth or you told me when no one was in the room with me i'm not going to mention his name
[02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:34.840]  he said you know i believe in this stuff too and he he was the one that was nice to me and he was
[02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:38.280]  trying to get me out of there probably because he was a little more awake well yeah because he
[02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:42.120]  got to be a moron not to know they blew up all those towers including so they said get back
[02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:47.080]  we're blowing it up i have the deputy emergency manager in new york on who said no they said get
[02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:52.440]  out they're going to blow it up and they killed him a week later they just said oh barry jennings
[02:17:52.440 --> 02:17:57.640]  he's dead now and then and then the family all we think they witnessed protection them actually
[02:17:57.640 --> 02:18:02.520]  because it was like he's dead family moves out no one will talk all these black vans at the house
[02:18:02.520 --> 02:18:08.600]  or they got the whole what do you think about that i don't i there's so much to think about

[02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:33.720]  i was probably back there for a good three hours at least three and a half and then i was there to
[02:18:33.720 --> 02:18:38.280]  the end pretty much like the stadium started shutting down like they kept me there and so
[02:18:38.280 --> 02:18:42.760]  pretty much they couldn't keep me there almost and then they said what you're lucky we didn't

[02:33:52.360 --> 02:33:57.160]  lot of sports guys are nice people and it would be okay if it was just a pastime but it's become
[02:33:57.160 --> 02:34:03.080]  our manhood and we've lost our manhood in the process we've been gelded by sports

[02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:28.120]  try i mean like you said honor trust duty and researching is addicting i mean we're all spirits
[02:34:28.120 --> 02:34:35.320]  on a human journey and some people say i'm obsessed some people say i'm whacked out others just listen
[02:34:36.280 --> 02:34:42.360]  and what i have to say to them is i consider you neo i just offer you the truth here's what's
[02:34:42.360 --> 02:34:49.720]  been happening in richmond this is one of my obsessions for the last 29 at a 29 precipitation
[02:34:49.720 --> 02:34:57.480]  events they've been preceded by one to three days of heavy chem trailing meaning i'm not talking about
[02:34:57.480 --> 02:35:04.520]  20 or 30 i'm talking about like yesterday and the day before hundreds i looked up last night when
[02:35:04.520 --> 02:35:10.440]  it started to rain and it burned my eyes now there's been some days where it didn't rain it didn't
[02:35:10.440 --> 02:35:18.200]  chem trail at all you see was contrails for five six seven days then all of a sudden one two you know
[02:35:18.200 --> 02:35:23.640]  50 60 next day hundreds and by the way geo engineering is an admitted fact and going on
[02:35:23.640 --> 02:35:28.520]  department of energy at least five billion a year but and they don't call it chem trails but then the
[02:35:28.520 --> 02:35:34.280]  general public is even aware that bill gates is running the program in the quote terraforming the
[02:35:34.280 --> 02:35:40.040]  earth into what they won't tell us what do you think they're doing well watching the different
[02:35:40.040 --> 02:35:45.000]  sprayers that are coming out that are on patent like you said if you just research there's different
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:50.920]  sprayers now if you watch the jets coming by and usually 99 of them are coming out of the south
[02:35:50.920 --> 02:35:58.600]  heading north and you can see the different types of nozzles because within five to 15 minutes
[02:35:59.240 --> 02:36:07.720]  it's either whispering it's either um like puffing and it's different shapes but they all turn into
[02:36:07.720 --> 02:36:13.000]  clouds where people like they people do not look up everybody and you have to be aware of you know
[02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:19.240]  the water you drink here's comes down to a relative of mine works for a municipal water system down
[02:36:19.240 --> 02:36:25.400]  south and we talked about fluoride he says oh you're not one of those fluoride nuts are you
[02:36:25.400 --> 02:36:30.760]  we've had people in our company that refuse to put fluoride in the water in the community water
[02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:37.400]  and they were fired i mean it's on record to be rat poison and the FDA has been forced to say take
[02:36:37.400 --> 02:36:41.960]  it out of the water and the pesticides but they won't and then and then people just laugh at us
[02:36:41.960 --> 02:36:47.000]  because we're informed insane great points dean i appreciate your call eric in connecticut you're
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:57.000]  on the air worldwide doing all right brother good uh you know i've gotten a little bit about
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:04.440]  archetypes with the super bowl and uh the way they played up Peyton Manning to be the superhero
[02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:09.240]  and of course the super bowl comes around he gets trounced they're always building up archetypes for
[02:37:09.240 --> 02:37:15.880]  us and then uh they they take them down to show that oh yeah i mean i mean i was i i was at a
[02:37:15.880 --> 02:37:22.120]  super bowl party at a building downtown in the bottom of the building uh you know in their
[02:37:22.120 --> 02:37:26.520]  event center or whatever and the people got so depressed when he started losing that i was
[02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:30.280]  on there about 45 minutes because they all started leaving and i left too i was already
[02:37:30.280 --> 02:37:37.080]  planning to i was observing this and and literally their hero was defeated so they all left i mean
[02:37:37.080 --> 02:37:44.840]  he was it's totally mindless go ahead yeah well it's a basic propaganda and psychological uh
[02:37:45.720 --> 02:37:51.720]  imprinting for these archetypes to be put on us and then obviously i've been awake for 10 years
[02:37:51.720 --> 02:37:57.480]  i'm from connecticut people here waking up uh i just want to give kudos to that guy that went up
[02:37:57.480 --> 02:38:03.960]  uh the press conference and and spoke about 9 11 you know i'd be the journalist myself i know that
[02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:09.480]  it's hard to come out and ask the uh hard questions because you could get fired or isolated that's
[02:38:09.480 --> 02:38:14.040]  right they they are controlling the press they're censoring media they're trying to shut down the
[02:38:14.040 --> 02:38:19.240]  alternative press it's time to take over press conferences civil disobedience it's time to ask
[02:38:19.240 --> 02:38:25.080]  real questions to jump up on microphones to go to city council to go to the mayor's event you see a
[02:38:25.080 --> 02:38:29.640]  mayor that's put the floor on your water and won't stop you see him eating you go over and you ruin
[02:38:29.640 --> 02:38:33.880]  his dinner it's it's time to get aggressive with these punks you know ahead of other things
[02:38:34.440 --> 02:38:39.000]  because they're engaged in chemical warfare against us they think it's funny they're assaulting us
[02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:45.560]  they should go to prison go ahead yeah absolutely and you know i was up there uh at sandy hook
[02:38:45.560 --> 02:38:51.880]  and to see this kind of uh propaganda just being the narrative being spun out nobody was asking the
[02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:58.840]  hard questions nobody was asking you know real uh real questions about definitive things that can
[02:38:58.840 --> 02:39:04.280]  out blow this narrative apart and it goes back to 9 11 the same thing you got to ask hard questions
[02:39:04.280 --> 02:39:10.520]  to blow the narrative apart and get some real information and uh so we could start uh you know
[02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:17.320]  gaining more victories here for the info war and the truth overall well said well said i mean i just
[02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:26.040]  see thousands rioting and knocking windows out and burning things in seattle and it's like oh
[02:39:26.040 --> 02:39:31.640]  isn't that cute the media says they love their team but if we were attacking federal reserve
[02:39:31.640 --> 02:39:35.320]  buildings burning them they'd send the military out on us to kill us that's on record that's been
[02:39:35.320 --> 02:39:39.000]  declassified i'm not saying burn down federal reserve buildings that makes them the victim
[02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:43.400]  just point out they're the foreign bank that's occupied us and destroy them politically they
[02:39:43.400 --> 02:39:47.240]  want to have a violent confrontation because they know they're losing the political that's why they
[02:39:47.240 --> 02:39:51.720]  want to flood us with illegals who'll then be clients of the democrats and republican leadership
[02:39:51.720 --> 02:39:56.360]  and vote to take our guns and politically checkmate us i mean this is very simple equations here
[02:39:58.360 --> 02:40:01.960]  let's go to a couple more calls and i'm going to play uh democrat operatives
[02:40:01.960 --> 02:40:09.000]  minions students signing petition listen to this to have gun owners executed in concentration camps
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:18.760]  that's up on info wars.com this is so insane i mean these people are just it's scary how dumb
[02:40:18.760 --> 02:40:25.160]  democratic trendies are and that's why msnbc and cnn always talk about how smart liberals are and
[02:40:25.160 --> 02:40:31.320]  how everyone else is dumb because it's a cult of how it is a cult where they're smart the hosts
[02:40:31.320 --> 02:40:36.840]  are smart praying on their client minions who they know literally are so stupid they just want to

[02:42:52.440 --> 02:43:00.200]  it and we are that standard as imperious we are forged in the fires of resistance to evil

[02:43:20.120 --> 02:43:25.400]  and the government preachers you know they they they windup toy they kill people physically but
[02:43:25.400 --> 02:43:30.680]  these preachers with the false doctrine they're preaching uh they kill people spiritually and
[02:43:30.680 --> 02:43:36.680]  they reach more people constantly than any of these government uh mentoring candidates
[02:43:36.680 --> 02:43:40.680]  well i know i go to these big mainline churches some of them are good but none of them will stand
[02:43:40.680 --> 02:43:46.040]  up against the government tyranny most the ones i've seen and it's all just basically 501c3
[02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:51.080]  and there's so many good people in these churches some of the nicest people you'll find
[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:57.160]  that are good fathers good mothers but they just they just sit there and roman's 13 all day
[02:43:59.400 --> 02:44:04.840]  this uh this 501c3 all those people out there that go to those churches you need to understand
[02:44:04.840 --> 02:44:12.760]  that when you fill out your your tax form to pay off the 1040 form which to pay your 1040 taxes
[02:44:12.760 --> 02:44:19.400]  that pays off the interest on the 1040 bonds that they sold to pay off the uh finance a
[02:44:19.400 --> 02:44:25.960]  civil war it'll never be paid off and it's written in scripture that um that we should
[02:44:25.960 --> 02:44:30.840]  serve god only not not man well yeah i mean exactly that's like they were trying to set
[02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:35.160]  up christ and they said hey should we pay taxes and he goes whose face is on that coin that's his
[02:44:35.720 --> 02:44:40.280]  give god the things that are god your children your family your heart but if they've got some
[02:44:40.280 --> 02:44:45.080]  artificial demon system it's like when you go in an nfl game you're now under their system
[02:44:45.080 --> 02:44:50.120]  but it doesn't mean we render undeceased or we render under the nfl we pay for the gladiator

[02:57:16.920 --> 02:57:23.800]  i've been trying to get through to you i i it's real important um all the flood maps that uh
[02:57:23.800 --> 02:57:31.400]  uh fema says that they have updated they have not uh through the bigger water insurance reform
[02:57:31.400 --> 02:57:39.240]  now are you saying fema lies or well yeah well we all know that um basically what they're doing is
[02:57:39.240 --> 02:57:44.920]  they're they're putting force by flood insurance on people then forcing them to get elevation
[02:57:44.920 --> 02:57:52.120]  certificates that feeds the information to fema also feeds it to reinsurance companies so that's
[02:57:52.120 --> 02:57:55.880]  no no it's a total deal to rip you off the insurance companies are owned by the banks
[02:57:55.880 --> 02:58:00.280]  that run the country and the whole government's being turned into a giant ripoff machine for them
[02:58:01.160 --> 02:58:08.760]  precisely uh so the problem is is i i went to congressman senator even the governor
[02:58:08.760 --> 02:58:13.400]  and ask who do i send my invoice to for the information that i'm supplying to the federal
[02:58:13.400 --> 02:58:22.200]  government boy i'll tell you they got real excited about that wanting my name they sent me uh the
[02:58:22.200 --> 02:58:27.320]  bottom line it's a total scam job you should do a youtube video on it you should talk about what
[02:58:27.320 --> 02:58:32.120]  happened to you but but yeah no they're trying to move people out of the areas uh that don't flood

[03:04:08.360 --> 03:04:13.480]  we show it exists and the congressman has the show taken off the air because they know that when
