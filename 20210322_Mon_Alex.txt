[00:00.000 --> 00:20.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a national emergency going on right now at our southern
[00:20.180 --> 00:22.440]  border.
[00:22.440 --> 00:24.360]  And we all know who's to blame.
[00:24.360 --> 00:25.760]  We all know what's to blame.
[00:25.760 --> 00:28.160]  We all know it's going on.
[00:28.160 --> 00:34.600]  And despite the Biden administration's attempts to bury it in the sand, despite the mainstream
[00:34.600 --> 00:41.440]  media's attempts to hide it and not report on it, it is inevitable that this will become
[00:41.440 --> 00:44.280]  the number one story in the country.
[00:44.280 --> 00:51.560]  The wide open southern border, the 1,000 percent increase in illegal immigration since Joe
[00:51.560 --> 00:54.840]  Biden has gotten into the White House.
[00:54.840 --> 01:02.160]  And now we have photos that have emerged from a Democrat in Texas.
[01:02.160 --> 01:04.400]  You see the media is being blocked out.
[01:04.400 --> 01:09.920]  All right, guys, let's, okay, well, that's a meme with AOC taking a nap there with the
[01:09.920 --> 01:11.160]  kids in cages.
[01:11.160 --> 01:12.560]  But let's be serious here.
[01:12.560 --> 01:17.680]  Funny though, you don't see AOC down there crying to an empty parking lot because, well,
[01:17.680 --> 01:22.040]  the narrative isn't there and the agenda isn't there.
[01:22.040 --> 01:28.000]  But no, we have the photos of kids in cages, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28.000 --> 01:34.200]  No, not AOC standing in a parking lot with no kids in cages when Trump was president.
[01:34.200 --> 01:36.280]  Now the kids in cages.
[01:36.280 --> 01:40.760]  Of course, this is what they choose when they come across the border illegally.
[01:40.760 --> 01:44.840]  This is what they choose just for the shot at the American way of life that they don't
[01:44.840 --> 01:48.640]  understand they've been lied to about.
[01:48.640 --> 01:51.640]  But we have an open border and a welfare state.
[01:51.640 --> 01:59.120]  And if you do the math on that, it equals game over, game over.
[01:59.120 --> 02:02.720]  Open border plus welfare state equals game over.
[02:02.720 --> 02:04.640]  The Democrats know it.
[02:04.640 --> 02:07.480]  The Chinese know it.
[02:07.480 --> 02:09.140]  And the mainstream media is probably too stupid.
[02:09.140 --> 02:10.620]  They don't know it.
[02:10.620 --> 02:12.520]  But that's what's going on.
[02:12.520 --> 02:18.400]  And so, guys, continue to just put these pictures up because, hey, look, we're not complaining
[02:18.400 --> 02:23.240]  about the unsanitary or inhumane treatment at the border or they're not wearing masks
[02:23.240 --> 02:24.600]  or they all have COVID.
[02:24.600 --> 02:28.440]  No, that's all a distraction.
[02:28.440 --> 02:34.360]  The real story is that we have a land invasion happening right now at our southern border.
[02:34.360 --> 02:38.440]  And so, also, if we have the time, guys, we have two minutes left, just pull up also all
[02:38.440 --> 02:43.440]  the videos, the B-roll of the people flooding across the border by the thousands crossing
[02:43.440 --> 02:48.600]  the rivers, crossing where the walls have not been completed.
[02:48.600 --> 02:50.040]  And so, yes.
[02:50.040 --> 02:56.040]  And then they come here and they do interviews with, and, you know, I thought of something
[02:56.040 --> 03:02.840]  last night with Martha Ratjazz, Raditz, where, and it's not just her.
[03:02.840 --> 03:04.200]  There have been about five or six.
[03:04.200 --> 03:10.040]  They played a compilation earlier today on Fox News of all the different illegal immigrants
[03:10.040 --> 03:13.360]  coming here, then doing interviews with media saying, we come here for Biden.
[03:13.360 --> 03:15.840]  They had thousands show up with Biden shirts.
[03:15.840 --> 03:18.080]  Finally, we found the biggest Biden rally.
[03:18.080 --> 03:20.840]  We found the Biden voters that weren't in the graveyard.
[03:20.840 --> 03:24.920]  They were coming across the southern border wearing Biden shirts, biggest Biden rally
[03:24.920 --> 03:25.920]  you've ever seen.
[03:25.920 --> 03:28.200]  They were coming across the southern border illegally.
[03:28.200 --> 03:30.600]  And then they sit down with media and they say, yeah, we came here for Biden.
[03:30.600 --> 03:31.800]  Yeah, we're here because of Biden.
[03:31.800 --> 03:34.360]  Yep, Biden's the one that told us to come here.
[03:34.360 --> 03:40.560]  And then the media, if outside of Peter Ducey, it even exists in the White House Press Corp.
[03:40.560 --> 03:47.400]  Oh, but then, you know, they say they're not coming here.
[03:47.400 --> 03:48.600]  This isn't Biden's.
[03:48.600 --> 03:49.800]  This is not Biden's fault.
[03:49.800 --> 03:50.960]  This is Trump's fault.
[03:50.960 --> 03:56.520]  They literally, it has literally gone up a thousand percent since Biden got in the White
[03:56.520 --> 03:57.520]  House.
[03:57.520 --> 04:00.880]  And the illegal immigrants across the southern border do a media interview and say, I'm here
[04:00.880 --> 04:02.120]  because of Biden.
[04:02.120 --> 04:06.400]  And then the Biden administration is either so incompetent and inept.
[04:06.400 --> 04:09.680]  We don't believe that, although there is a level of that.
[04:09.680 --> 04:11.520]  They say, oh, this is Trump's fault.
[04:11.520 --> 04:13.160]  This has nothing to do with Biden.
[04:13.160 --> 04:14.160]  What?
[04:14.160 --> 04:17.640]  They literally show up wearing Biden shirts and then they do interviews saying we came
[04:17.640 --> 04:19.040]  here because of Biden.
[04:19.040 --> 04:22.680]  Oh, and then the Biden administration says, there's nothing happening at the southern
[04:22.680 --> 04:23.680]  border.
[04:23.680 --> 04:25.200]  This is true, but it's also Trump's fault.
[04:25.200 --> 04:28.080]  So there is no crisis, but the crisis is Trump's fault.
[04:28.080 --> 04:30.840]  You see how that works?
[04:30.840 --> 04:35.280]  So ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroer sitting in for Alex Jones right here on the Alex
[04:35.280 --> 04:38.920]  Jones show in the Info Wars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[04:38.920 --> 04:40.520]  Alex Jones is coming up on the other side.
[04:40.520 --> 04:42.760]  We're going to be hearing from Alex today.
[04:42.760 --> 04:45.760]  Your prayers today, your financial support today.
[04:45.760 --> 04:49.160]  Tell your friends and family about the broadcast today.
[04:49.160 --> 04:50.640]  Alex doing some serious business.
[04:50.640 --> 04:55.440]  He may be able to update you on that, hopefully good news in the future, but he'll be coming
[04:55.440 --> 04:58.680]  up on the other side of this break.
[04:58.680 --> 05:02.560]  You cannot hide a grand assault.
[05:02.560 --> 05:04.440]  America is about to have its energy cut off.
[05:04.440 --> 05:06.440]  Its border is destroyed.
[05:06.440 --> 05:09.240]  Its dollar brought down to nothing.
[05:09.240 --> 05:14.320]  All of you that have served Satan believe that you are on the right team.
[05:14.320 --> 05:17.280]  You're about to find out how pathetic you are.
[05:17.280 --> 05:24.480]  So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God, stop living in fear.
[05:24.480 --> 05:27.280]  The enemy is about to expose itself.
[05:27.280 --> 05:29.600]  The enemy can't help itself.
[05:29.600 --> 05:33.680]  The enemy comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[05:33.680 --> 05:39.080]  We sit here as good people get upset about that and try to stop it if we should, but
[05:39.080 --> 05:44.880]  once it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking
[05:44.880 --> 05:49.160]  us, we just have to point out we tried to stop it.
[05:49.160 --> 05:51.320]  So prepare yourselves, America.
[05:51.320 --> 05:54.960]  You're going under a judge but just like all the children that were aborted.
[05:54.960 --> 05:56.600]  This is the truth.
[05:56.600 --> 06:16.120]  This is the Info War.
[06:16.120 --> 06:19.160]  It's Monday, March 22nd, the year is 2021.
[06:19.160 --> 06:21.360]  I am your host, Alex Jones, on the road.
[06:21.360 --> 06:24.880]  Owen Schroyer is about to be taking over, but people are really upset.
[06:24.880 --> 06:28.240]  People are really concerned right now and for good reason.
[06:28.240 --> 06:32.880]  America and the entire world is in a huge crisis.
[06:32.880 --> 06:39.640]  The crisis is America right now because we have a criminal organized group that has hijacked,
[06:39.640 --> 06:40.640]  controlled the nation.
[06:40.640 --> 06:46.040]  And at the heart of that crisis and at the heart of that problem is Joe Biden the puppet.
[06:46.040 --> 06:47.040]  He stole the election.
[06:47.040 --> 06:49.080]  The evidence is completely overwhelming.
[06:49.080 --> 06:52.280]  The people know that he's incredibly unpopular.
[06:52.280 --> 06:55.360]  The YouTube streams he gets have a thousand viewers.
[06:55.360 --> 06:56.920]  Trumps have five million.
[06:56.920 --> 07:03.480]  The system is designed to collapse the United States because the U.S. cannot exist inside
[07:03.480 --> 07:04.880]  of a one world government.
[07:04.880 --> 07:09.200]  You can't have a free country with private property and a middle class and a second
[07:09.200 --> 07:12.840]  amendment where the rest of the world is under globalist tyranny.
[07:12.840 --> 07:16.520]  You can't have a country where you don't have to take vaccines, but every other country
[07:16.520 --> 07:17.800]  has to take vaccines.
[07:17.800 --> 07:22.880]  You can't have a country where people can practice their own religion in peace when
[07:22.880 --> 07:25.320]  other countries like China don't let you do that.
[07:25.320 --> 07:30.520]  So America has to be rolled into this politically correct global government system.
[07:30.520 --> 07:35.440]  And that's what's happening right now is a process of demoralizing us, breaking down
[07:35.440 --> 07:39.680]  our borders, destroying our currency, jacking up our power prices, putting regulations in
[07:39.680 --> 07:45.000]  that make it impossible for you to do business inside America unless you're a multinational
[07:45.000 --> 07:47.280]  corporation who's based outside the country.
[07:47.280 --> 07:52.720]  This is economic war, and I know you all know that, but we all need to have that really
[07:52.720 --> 07:57.280]  sink in that this is 21st century war.
[07:57.280 --> 08:01.760]  This is economic war, and all the people that play along with the whole leftist ideology
[08:01.760 --> 08:04.160]  are pretending that they're part of the power structure.
[08:04.160 --> 08:08.000]  They're pretending they're on the winning team when really they're being destroyed just
[08:08.000 --> 08:09.000]  like the rest of us.
[08:09.000 --> 08:10.760]  And so there's really a paradox here.
[08:10.760 --> 08:12.840]  The left acts like they're the resistance.
[08:12.840 --> 08:16.800]  They act like they're fighting the establishment, but they have all the banks, all the media,
[08:16.800 --> 08:23.160]  all the universities, communist China, the EU, most of the cities, the list just goes
[08:23.160 --> 08:25.480]  on and on.
[08:25.480 --> 08:31.080]  All the big mainline churches are globalists now piling on to get rid of our sovereignty,
[08:31.080 --> 08:36.520]  piling on to get rid of our families, piling on to attack the nuclear family, and it's
[08:36.520 --> 08:37.600]  all in their white papers.
[08:37.600 --> 08:38.800]  It's all their textbooks.
[08:38.800 --> 08:40.800]  It's all their plans to do this.
[08:40.800 --> 08:45.640]  Go watch my film Endgame that I made in 2007.
[08:45.640 --> 08:46.640]  Hard to believe now.
[08:46.640 --> 08:47.960]  10 years ago.
[08:47.960 --> 08:50.920]  And in that film, I say we're going to be in lockdown cities.
[08:50.920 --> 08:53.480]  We're going to use fake bio attacks to do it.
[08:53.480 --> 08:56.160]  The family will be coming obsolete.
[08:56.160 --> 08:58.160]  Everything we do will be surveilled.
[08:58.160 --> 09:01.760]  You'll have a special tracking system where if you're not a good globalist, you want to
[09:01.760 --> 09:03.520]  be able to buy or sell.
[09:03.520 --> 09:10.560]  This is the system that has been established, and it's a predatory system.
[09:10.560 --> 09:15.480]  So people can live in denial all they want about this, but this is the establishment.
[09:15.480 --> 09:21.760]  This is the UN, this is the big global governance power system, overriding nation states, overriding
[09:21.760 --> 09:25.400]  regional governments, and overriding individual freedoms.
[09:25.400 --> 09:26.900]  There above the law.
[09:26.900 --> 09:31.400]  Think of it as global, imminent domain.
[09:31.400 --> 09:35.240]  It's a great piece of satire, a great piece of comedy, science fiction.
[09:35.240 --> 09:38.080]  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
[09:38.080 --> 09:41.400]  And the aliens show up and they give people five minutes to evacuate because they're
[09:41.400 --> 09:44.960]  building a space highway through, they're about to blow your planet up.
[09:44.960 --> 09:47.040]  And for the globalists, that's how they think.
[09:47.040 --> 09:49.360]  Clow Schwab has talked about it, Ray Kurzweil has talked about it.
[09:49.360 --> 09:55.360]  You can read their quotes, you can see their quotes in my film Endgame from many of them.
[09:55.360 --> 10:01.200]  Saying, when we merge with machines around the year 2035, you'll be like a houseplant
[10:01.200 --> 10:02.200]  if you're lucky.
[10:02.200 --> 10:05.360]  If not, you'll be like an ant we just step on.
[10:05.360 --> 10:06.360]  Just totally disregarded.
[10:06.360 --> 10:08.760]  Now, whether that's really going to happen or not, whether they're going to become these
[10:08.760 --> 10:13.200]  AI gods, I tend to say that's a bunch of delusions of grandeur.
[10:13.200 --> 10:19.120]  But regardless, this is the attitude and the perspective they come at people with.
[10:19.120 --> 10:24.480]  And it was Aldous Huxley, who wrote Brave New World, who later wrote Brave New World Revisited
[10:24.480 --> 10:28.120]  in 61 before he died, who said, hey, this is all really our plan.
[10:28.120 --> 10:33.360]  His brother ran the U.N. at the time, Julian Huxley, and he said, unlike 1984, George Orwell's
[10:33.360 --> 10:39.240]  vision of the future, it's going to be one with propaganda and drugs entertainment where
[10:39.240 --> 10:47.960]  you're mesmerized positronically, electronically, and chemically, where you'll love your servitude,
[10:47.960 --> 10:51.800]  where you will enjoy your servitude because you're going to be in a trance state.
[10:51.800 --> 10:57.120]  And now all the medical literature shows the average TV head is in a near trance state
[10:57.120 --> 11:03.480]  of a very highly suggestible, close to daydreaming, close to dreaming state where they flicker
[11:03.480 --> 11:08.160]  in and out of consciousness and are just being programmed by the devices, by the phones, by
[11:08.160 --> 11:10.040]  all the rest of it.
[11:10.040 --> 11:12.120]  And so you have to become conscious of that.
[11:12.120 --> 11:17.320]  And in fact, I've seen a lot of psychiatrists and I've seen a lot of psychologists who are
[11:17.320 --> 11:22.140]  involved in psychological warfare and advertising, and they will say, you've got to get inside
[11:22.140 --> 11:27.200]  your head, you've got to realize you are who you are, and kind of create like a horizon
[11:27.200 --> 11:31.760]  like you're flying an airplane and anchor yourself to that when you are engaged in all
[11:31.760 --> 11:36.240]  this propaganda against the general public, or you yourself will get lost in it.
[11:36.240 --> 11:39.040]  The truth is they have gotten lost in it.
[11:39.040 --> 11:42.960]  How does Klaus Schwab and Ted Turner and Bill Gates and all these people think they're
[11:42.960 --> 11:47.040]  going to carry all this out against humanity and then get away with in the end?
[11:47.040 --> 11:48.960]  They're obviously not.
[11:48.960 --> 11:51.360]  They call this a breakaway civilization.
[11:51.360 --> 11:55.240]  This is your future if you let them guide us towards it.
[11:55.240 --> 11:59.360]  We're like moths of the flame following along with these people, and so are they.
[11:59.360 --> 12:03.160]  They're just moths that went first before us and have already been basically caught
[12:03.160 --> 12:08.720]  up in their own megalomaniacal delusions of grandeur.
[12:08.720 --> 12:14.000]  These are megalomaniacs, and now you see the border being completely dissolved and children
[12:14.000 --> 12:18.120]  being smuggled across, and the press secretary saying, as long as you've got a kid, you can
[12:18.120 --> 12:21.600]  get in the country free, we're just going to let you in for human smuggling.
[12:21.600 --> 12:25.680]  But oh, we're not going to test you like aliens for COVID or tuberculosis or anything else,
[12:25.680 --> 12:30.600]  but we're going to test you, and your businesses are going to stay closed, but the big box stores
[12:30.600 --> 12:31.760]  are going to stay open.
[12:31.760 --> 12:36.840]  This is all economic warfare, and it came out on a telegraph yesterday that China is
[12:36.840 --> 12:42.880]  the big winner of the pandemic, and China doubled its wealth, and so did big tech with
[12:42.880 --> 12:45.120]  its partners because they're the ones that ran it.
[12:45.120 --> 12:47.000]  They launched the attack out of Wuhan.
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.600]  They showed all the hysteria and the fear.
[12:49.600 --> 12:51.360]  They panicked the general public.
[12:51.360 --> 12:57.440]  They created the perception that everyone needed to basically run into their houses and
[12:57.440 --> 12:59.440]  never come out again.
[12:59.440 --> 13:04.680]  And so now they are the beneficiaries of the giant PSYOP that they ran.
[13:04.680 --> 13:08.160]  And until you realize you've been conned, and that you're not part of the establishment,
[13:08.160 --> 13:11.520]  until you realize the whole thing's a lie, and this is predatory, and until you as a
[13:11.520 --> 13:16.160]  conservative or a liberal or a Christian or a Buddhist or a Muslim or an atheist understand
[13:16.160 --> 13:21.360]  that there is a scientific dictatorship that is manipulating and controlling society, or
[13:21.360 --> 13:24.360]  that is turning us against each other, you have no hope.
[13:24.360 --> 13:28.600]  I have no hope of navigating this, so we have to come together and realize what's happening.
[13:28.600 --> 13:29.920]  Owen Shor is about to take over.
[13:29.920 --> 13:31.720]  Later, I'm going to break down.
[13:31.720 --> 13:35.000]  Biden's saying, open the borders, come in, rush the borders.
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.840]  Now he's saying, oh, there's not a border crisis.
[13:37.840 --> 13:39.600]  People are now seeing the warfare.
[13:39.600 --> 13:41.400]  They're seeing the country be dismantled.
[13:41.400 --> 13:43.160]  They're seeing the gas prices explode.
[13:43.160 --> 13:46.320]  They're seeing the XL pipeline shut down, the Keystone pipeline.
[13:46.320 --> 13:51.080]  They're seeing all of these attacks and realizing that when they make our military wear red
[13:51.080 --> 13:55.000]  high heels and all the rest of this, that it's designed to demoralize us, and people are
[13:55.000 --> 13:56.000]  starting to really get it.
[13:56.000 --> 13:59.360]  The question is, will it be fast enough?
[13:59.360 --> 14:02.840]  We're fighting harder than ever at infohors.com and newshors.com, but we can't do without
[14:02.840 --> 14:03.840]  your help.
[14:03.840 --> 14:05.600]  So please, as you do every day, you've done a great job.
[14:05.600 --> 14:08.880]  Tell folks about the local station you're listening to or station you're watching, like
[14:08.880 --> 14:11.600]  your life depends on it because it does.
[14:11.600 --> 14:14.680]  Share the live links to the show where we have medical doctors and scientists coming
[14:14.680 --> 14:20.080]  on exposing that this isn't a vaccine, that it's a poison, especially the mRNA, and realize
[14:20.080 --> 14:24.520]  that this is the fight that humanity has for the future, and that this is so real, and
[14:24.520 --> 14:26.880]  that what we've covered has been over the target.
[14:26.880 --> 14:31.040]  That's why we were the first to be banned and are still the most banned because the enemy
[14:31.040 --> 14:35.240]  understands that we've got the blueprint for their operation and we know how to stop them.
[14:35.240 --> 14:36.400]  We have their playbook.
[14:36.400 --> 14:38.360]  So again, Owen's about to take over.
[14:38.360 --> 14:42.120]  Also please remember, we've got the big blowout sale going right now on a whole bunch of select
[14:42.120 --> 14:46.760]  items with free shipping and 50% off all the Emirates essentials, alpha power that is a
[14:46.760 --> 14:48.320]  great focus, a new tropic.
[14:48.320 --> 14:51.520]  When I'm tired in the afternoon, I need to keep working, I pop one of them, pop two of
[14:51.520 --> 14:56.480]  them, incredible five, six hours of clean focus energy, that's 50% off, and we've got
[14:56.480 --> 15:00.440]  so many other great products at m4store.com and without you purchasing them, we will not
[15:00.440 --> 15:01.440]  be here.
[15:01.440 --> 15:05.120]  But thanks to you, we've been able to stay on the air despite the attacks and the tribulations
[15:05.120 --> 15:06.120]  and things that are going on.
[15:06.120 --> 15:08.960]  So I want to thank you all for your financial support, and I want to thank you all for your
[15:08.960 --> 15:14.080]  word of mouth, I want to thank you all for your prayers because this is a group effort
[15:14.080 --> 15:18.080]  to win this fight and you are not people in the stands, you are men and women of your
[15:18.080 --> 15:23.160]  race, color, and creed in that arena, and I want to thank you all for keeping us in
[15:23.160 --> 15:25.080]  a position to continue on the fight.
[15:25.080 --> 15:27.600]  God bless, I want to short a text over on the ATX.
[15:27.600 --> 15:32.720]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, when we come back from this break, I'm going to be deliberating
[15:32.720 --> 15:35.120]  in the break, deciding where I want to go here.
[15:35.120 --> 15:40.880]  We've got political developments from the Democrat Party, we've got, well, a lot of,
[15:40.880 --> 15:42.920]  a lot there to get to.
[15:42.920 --> 15:46.000]  We've also got some world developments.
[15:46.000 --> 15:49.880]  The world is destabilizing since Biden has been in, but then I've got a massive stack
[15:49.880 --> 15:56.680]  of COVID news with the fake pandemic that, quite frankly, mind-boggling, is never right.
[15:56.680 --> 16:00.120]  Actually, we bought this at Blocks, UHF frequencies.
[16:00.120 --> 16:06.240]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us, not just tracking
[16:06.240 --> 16:13.320]  and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well, with or without a
[16:13.320 --> 16:14.320]  battery.
[16:14.320 --> 16:20.760]  Now, with the InfoWars privacy pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[16:20.760 --> 16:21.760]  Excellent.
[16:21.760 --> 16:28.920]  Now, I have my own compact Faraday cage I can take wherever I want, and you can too
[16:28.920 --> 16:32.200]  at infowarstore.com.
[16:32.200 --> 16:39.440]  Government agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now contact tracers are all tracking
[16:39.440 --> 16:42.240]  your every move through your mobile phone.
[16:42.240 --> 16:47.920]  Now, you can have the power to easily cut them off and go dark.

[17:55.240 --> 17:57.040]  a 360 win.
[17:57.040 --> 18:17.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[18:17.760 --> 18:33.560]  You know, every once in a while, there's a story or a development that shows the fraud
[18:33.560 --> 18:37.600]  of the entire system.
[18:37.600 --> 18:43.640]  And really, there's a couple going right now, the COVID and the border crisis, but I want
[18:43.640 --> 18:49.920]  to focus on the border crisis now and then I'll try to get to all this COVID nonsense
[18:49.920 --> 18:50.920]  in the next segment.
[18:50.920 --> 18:58.520]  But it's really incredible what's happening at the southern border and what it exposes
[18:58.520 --> 19:04.800]  is the lies and the fraud and the deception of the current administration, the Biden administration.
[19:04.800 --> 19:15.360]  It exposes the agenda that is afoot to destabilize and collapse the United States of America
[19:15.360 --> 19:21.720]  with the invasion at the southern border, economic warfare, demographic replacement,
[19:21.720 --> 19:23.080]  to all by design.
[19:23.080 --> 19:34.120]  And now you have Biden, border crisis by design warns ex-ice chief, yeah, you don't say.
[19:34.120 --> 19:42.360]  And then last night, people are watching Mark Levin on Fox talking about Cloward and Piven.
[19:42.360 --> 19:45.440]  And so people are messaging me, hey, look, Fox is talking about Cloward and Piven.
[19:45.440 --> 19:50.920]  The stuff InfoWars talked about 10 years ago.
[19:50.920 --> 19:53.440]  So hey, good for Mark Levin.
[19:53.440 --> 19:57.520]  The border has been a disaster for decades.
[19:57.520 --> 19:59.640]  Nobody wants to talk about it.
[19:59.640 --> 20:05.400]  So the story of the southern border proves the Biden administration is lying and deceiving.
[20:05.400 --> 20:11.280]  There is an agenda to collapse the southern border, collapse the United States of America,
[20:11.280 --> 20:16.120]  and the media for the most part is covering it up.
[20:16.120 --> 20:22.640]  The media for the most part is covering it up.
[20:22.640 --> 20:31.680]  And so when you have a Democrat from Texas, and I actually think this was a by design,
[20:31.680 --> 20:39.040]  a Democrat from Texas goes to the southern border and then they release the first known
[20:39.040 --> 20:46.560]  images from the kids in cages, detention centers, since the Biden administration began, because
[20:46.560 --> 20:51.160]  the Biden administration is not allowing media in there.
[20:51.160 --> 20:55.920]  But so a Democrat gets in there and releases the photos.
[20:55.920 --> 21:02.160]  But of course, this is right before Project Veritas does the same thing, guys, if you
[21:02.160 --> 21:03.160]  want to roll.
[21:03.160 --> 21:08.760]  In fact, let's go to this Project Veritas two minute clip here.
[21:08.760 --> 21:15.920]  Project Veritas obtains never before seen images from inside Texas detention facility.
[21:15.920 --> 21:21.640]  Project Veritas has obtained never before seen photographs of what it actually looks
[21:21.640 --> 21:27.640]  like inside this facility, shocking images showing people wrapped up in what looks like
[21:27.640 --> 21:32.760]  metal foil, laying on the ground, their faces covered.
[21:32.760 --> 21:35.160]  Why won't the administration be honest about this?
[21:35.160 --> 21:37.440]  Why won't they show you these images?
[21:37.440 --> 21:40.360]  I'm on the ground in Donna, Texas, if you want to take a look at this facility right
[21:40.360 --> 21:44.040]  here, just a month ago, Customs and Border Patrol agents completed the construction
[21:44.040 --> 21:45.040]  of that facility.
[21:45.040 --> 21:50.680]  It's a 165,000 square foot facility, and we have never seen images inside this facility
[21:50.680 --> 21:51.680]  before.
[21:51.680 --> 21:56.400]  They won't even allow the non-profit lawyers who conduct the actual oversight of these
[21:56.400 --> 21:58.280]  immigration detention centers to go inside.
[21:58.280 --> 22:00.120]  We have a man who's telling us to leave.
[22:00.120 --> 22:01.120]  Where were the press?
[22:01.120 --> 22:07.920]  They told us it's private property, but you know it isn't private property?
[22:07.920 --> 22:08.920]  Airspace.
[22:08.920 --> 22:13.920]  We're going to fly this Cirrus right over the top of the detention center to get a better
[22:13.920 --> 22:14.920]  look.
[22:14.920 --> 22:19.920]  We're going to see if there is flying over the facility to give you a better look.
[22:19.920 --> 22:21.960]  We're doing a recent press conference.
[22:21.960 --> 22:26.360]  The press secretary was asked a question why they haven't released these images.
[22:26.360 --> 22:31.280]  Even you haven't released any images that you obviously could redact if you wanted to.
[22:31.280 --> 22:35.840]  Again, we remain committed to sharing with all of you the treatment.
[22:35.840 --> 22:39.160]  She dodged the question saying, quote, and we remain committed to transparency.
[22:39.160 --> 22:41.160]  I don't have an update for you on the timeline.
[22:41.160 --> 22:48.680]  Well, press secretary of the White House, let Project Veritas do your job for you.
[22:48.680 --> 22:55.000]  Just last night, we have now obtained these photos inside this facility.
[22:55.000 --> 22:57.040]  Now these photos are very, very grim.
[22:57.040 --> 23:02.360]  Project Veritas has also learned these photographs were taken in the last few days.
[23:02.360 --> 23:06.160]  There are eight pods with eight cells in each facility.
[23:06.160 --> 23:11.360]  At any given moment, they're an average of 3,000 people in custody inside this detention
[23:11.360 --> 23:12.360]  center.
[23:12.360 --> 23:19.880]  There are eight cells that are currently holding 600 unaccompanied juvenile males aged seven
[23:19.880 --> 23:20.880]  to 17.
[23:20.880 --> 23:25.840]  They're separated by age or physical size, depending on the room, 50 individuals inside
[23:25.840 --> 23:28.040]  this facility were COVID positive.
[23:28.040 --> 23:34.600]  There have been multiple sexual assaults, normal assaults, and daily medical emergencies.
[23:34.600 --> 23:41.360]  Now think about how sick it is that this is all part of a global destabilization agenda
[23:41.360 --> 23:46.080]  specifically to destabilize the United States of America, and these poor people are being
[23:46.080 --> 23:49.640]  used for that force.
[23:49.640 --> 23:52.680]  So yeah, they get told, hey, come into America.
[23:52.680 --> 23:53.680]  You'll get everything for free.
[23:53.680 --> 23:54.720]  You'll get a bunch of money.
[23:54.720 --> 23:55.720]  Come on in.
[23:55.720 --> 23:56.720]  The border's open.
[23:56.720 --> 23:59.680]  And then there's actual border patrol and people that are like, hey, what the hell's going
[23:59.680 --> 24:01.320]  on here?
[24:01.320 --> 24:04.000]  And so the Biden administration kind of has to capitulate a little bit.
[24:04.000 --> 24:07.040]  They can't just be like, hey, we're allowing an invasion to happen, even though that's
[24:07.040 --> 24:09.080]  what they are doing effectively.
[24:09.080 --> 24:13.080]  So they build new facilities and they put tens of thousands, hundreds of thousand people
[24:13.080 --> 24:15.840]  stacked them up like sardines and these things.
[24:15.840 --> 24:18.880]  Of course, after four years of complaining about what Trump was doing at the southern
[24:18.880 --> 24:28.880]  border, which was humane, which was common sense, but notice how they don't want the
[24:28.880 --> 24:29.880]  media in there.
[24:29.880 --> 24:36.160]  So Project Veritas has to get leaked photos, and then I am a little suspicious because
[24:36.160 --> 24:41.200]  a Democrat released the photos, the exact, pretty much the exact photos that Project
[24:41.200 --> 24:45.800]  Veritas released just mere hours before Project Veritas did it.
[24:45.800 --> 24:50.120]  So it's almost like the Democrats knew Project Veritas was about to leak that story.
[24:50.120 --> 24:55.040]  So they let their candidate leak the images first saying, here's what's going on.
[24:55.040 --> 24:58.040]  It's under control, all this stuff to try to control the narrative.
[24:58.040 --> 25:01.080]  So I mean, this is the stuff that goes on behind the scenes, folks.
[25:01.080 --> 25:06.080]  Believe me, they would not have had their own Democrat from Texas.
[25:06.080 --> 25:10.080]  His office, I forget the individual's name, published all the photos that it's basically
[25:10.080 --> 25:14.920]  the exact same photos published by Project Veritas just hours before Project Veritas
[25:14.920 --> 25:17.600]  did it to control the narrative.
[25:17.600 --> 25:22.360]  So that's the level of warfare right now, information warfare happening at the southern
[25:22.360 --> 25:23.360]  border.
[25:23.360 --> 25:24.360]  What is the agenda?
[25:24.360 --> 25:25.440]  What is going on?
[25:25.440 --> 25:27.320]  They show up wearing Biden shirts.
[25:27.320 --> 25:28.320]  They talk to media.
[25:28.320 --> 25:30.000]  They say, we came here because of Biden.
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.200]  You asked the Biden administration what's going on.
[25:32.200 --> 25:35.320]  They tell you nothing to see here.
[25:35.320 --> 25:37.240]  It was Henry Quaylar.
[25:37.240 --> 25:46.000]  Thank you, the Texas Democrat just, just before Project Veritas released their photos.
[25:46.000 --> 25:50.640]  Oh, but hey, even, even, even these Democrats and Texas are like, what the hell are you
[25:50.640 --> 25:51.640]  doing here?
[25:51.640 --> 25:52.640]  We have a wide open border.
[25:52.640 --> 25:53.640]  They're coming in with COVID.
[25:53.640 --> 25:58.440]  They thought there was a pandemic.
[25:58.440 --> 26:06.960]  So imagine though, imagine how dastardly these people are to lie and say, oh, come in here.
[26:06.960 --> 26:09.360]  Of course, they try to do, give them as much as they can.
[26:09.360 --> 26:10.360]  They give them hotels.
[26:10.360 --> 26:22.040]  In fact, the Biden administration has earmarked $86 million to purchase hotel rooms.
[26:22.040 --> 26:25.800]  And they claim for 1200 illegal immigrants.
[26:25.800 --> 26:32.400]  That's $395 a night for illegal immigrants to stay in a hotel.
[26:32.400 --> 26:34.720]  That's a pretty nice hotel.
[26:34.720 --> 26:37.160]  That's a pretty nice chunk of change.
[26:37.160 --> 26:39.000]  You don't get that benefit.
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.080]  Why are they doing it for noncitizens?
[26:42.080 --> 26:43.960]  It's all part of an agenda.
[26:43.960 --> 26:45.440]  It's all part of an agenda.
[26:45.440 --> 26:46.440]  And where's Biden?
[26:46.440 --> 26:49.000]  Well, he says, at some point he'll visit the border.
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.600]  Oh, at some point, at some point.
[26:51.600 --> 26:56.720]  At some point, probably never going to come.
[26:56.720 --> 27:02.360]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and
[27:02.360 --> 27:06.440]  full verses that if you're paying attention, you know, we've done together.
[27:06.440 --> 27:09.720]  But I'll tell you this.
[27:09.720 --> 27:15.600]  The technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent
[27:15.600 --> 27:16.600]  forms of media.
[27:16.600 --> 27:22.560]  They're trying to shudder and silence the human resistance, so now is the time to understand
[27:22.560 --> 27:26.040]  that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate, everything you warned your
[27:26.040 --> 27:28.560]  friends and family about is about to be true.
[27:28.560 --> 27:33.600]  So it's now that your credibility is way up, the power structures of the silence, those
[27:33.600 --> 27:40.320]  of us that they can't, but it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[27:40.320 --> 27:46.360]  We have the power, but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[27:46.360 --> 27:51.360]  We have to make sure that we find our right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't
[27:51.360 --> 27:52.360]  come.
[27:52.360 --> 27:57.880]  So be the polar bearer as you are.
[27:57.880 --> 28:04.840]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand
[28:04.840 --> 28:06.160]  that this is all a test.
[28:06.160 --> 28:12.160]  This experience, this waiffulness planet is a reckoning.
[28:12.160 --> 28:17.440]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension so we can decide
[28:17.440 --> 28:21.720]  where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to, and it really does come
[28:21.720 --> 28:22.720]  down to that.
[28:22.720 --> 28:26.760]  So as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as
[28:26.760 --> 28:31.040]  well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[28:31.040 --> 28:34.640]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[28:34.640 --> 28:40.240]  God is the author of us having free will, and that free will is a beautiful thing.
[28:40.240 --> 28:44.680]  And when you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington,
[28:44.680 --> 28:49.760]  D.C., and Fauci, and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[28:49.760 --> 28:53.760]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the bad because Satan hates
[28:53.760 --> 28:57.440]  you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[28:57.440 --> 29:02.400]  It's so hard for me when I'm cutting ads to not get overly excited.
[29:02.400 --> 29:05.440]  People ask me all the time, they go, Joe, you want cocaine or you want meth?
[29:05.440 --> 29:06.440]  How are you so excited?
[29:06.440 --> 29:09.800]  How do I not get excited about world government?
[29:09.800 --> 29:15.480]  Horse mass, horse nodulations, open announcements that our country is going to be dissolved.
[29:15.480 --> 29:16.480]  I'm sorry.
[29:16.480 --> 29:17.980]  I'm a fighter.
[29:17.980 --> 29:20.640]  And I know many of you out there watching and listening are fighters as well.
[29:20.640 --> 29:22.720]  And so I'll just say this.
[29:22.720 --> 29:23.720]  I try to be calm.
[29:23.720 --> 29:24.720]  I try to be focused.
[29:24.720 --> 29:26.520]  I don't know what I do.
[29:26.520 --> 29:31.720]  I wasn't still on air right now, but I just really want to thank you for keeping us on
[29:31.720 --> 29:36.520]  air because you have to realize when I tell you that you're the infomer, that's not me
[29:36.520 --> 29:37.920]  patting on the head.
[29:37.920 --> 29:41.640]  You are 99% of the equation.
[29:41.640 --> 29:45.840]  So when you decide to spread the word, when you decide to buy the products, infowarstore.com,
[29:45.840 --> 29:49.400]  when you decide to share the articles and videos we produce, it changes the world.
[29:49.400 --> 29:51.720]  So you are the info war.
[29:51.720 --> 29:53.320]  Thank you so much for the fight.
[29:53.320 --> 29:54.520]  Thank you for all you've done.
[29:54.520 --> 29:58.520]  Now let's take action together and take down the globalist.
[29:58.520 --> 30:03.600]  The entire new world order system is about making you feel pathetic and making you feel
[30:03.600 --> 30:08.240]  weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being
[30:08.240 --> 30:14.080]  made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[30:14.080 --> 30:20.160]  Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[30:20.160 --> 30:22.160]  an entire system.
[30:22.160 --> 30:25.600]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact you're able to see the beauty
[30:25.600 --> 30:30.040]  of the sunset or the beauty of the waves in the ocean or the beauty of your wife or your
[30:30.040 --> 30:34.960]  husband or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music, the fact that
[30:34.960 --> 30:41.040]  you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic and that itself is what God
[30:41.040 --> 30:42.800]  teaches us is worship.
[30:42.800 --> 30:47.280]  So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things of the
[30:47.280 --> 30:52.800]  system, but worship the things of God because we're made by God and appreciate your consciousness
[30:52.800 --> 31:00.000]  and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[31:00.000 --> 31:16.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:16.960 --> 31:23.360]  You know it's really incredible to be living in these times, the most insane times perhaps,
[31:23.360 --> 31:30.600]  at least in recent history for sure, where you have a totally defunct president and open
[31:30.600 --> 31:36.320]  agenda to destroy the country, the United States of America at the root of it, the core
[31:36.320 --> 31:41.840]  of it is in the White House supposed to be leading the country and it's at the charge
[31:41.840 --> 31:44.480]  leading to destroy the country.
[31:44.480 --> 31:53.160]  And then again, the national emergency at the southern border is just so illustrative
[31:53.160 --> 31:57.320]  of so many things, the fraud of the media, the fraud of the Democrat Party, the lies
[31:57.320 --> 32:04.000]  of the Biden administration, the agenda to collapse the country, the false COVID fear,
[32:04.000 --> 32:12.880]  the false fear of viruses, all of it exposed in one story at the southern border.
[32:12.880 --> 32:16.440]  So I just sit here and like, I think it's like, here's the skeleton key to understanding
[32:16.440 --> 32:21.200]  the lies of the media, the lies of the politicians, the agenda to destroy America, wide open southern
[32:21.200 --> 32:26.320]  border, just total common sense, total common sense.
[32:26.320 --> 32:32.360]  And they're so bold in their treason in the White House, they don't even care.
[32:32.360 --> 32:36.880]  Yeah, the borders wide open, yeah, they come across wearing Biden shirts, yeah, they talk
[32:36.880 --> 32:39.560]  to the media and say they came here for Biden.
[32:39.560 --> 32:49.240]  Yeah, it's a thousands percentage, thousands of percentage increase from the past year
[32:49.240 --> 32:52.800]  since Biden got in and they just shrugged their shoulders, they say, there's nothing
[32:52.800 --> 32:53.800]  going on.
[32:53.800 --> 32:56.680]  It's not, no, it's just a narrative.
[32:56.680 --> 32:57.680]  No it's happening.
[32:57.680 --> 32:58.680]  You can't hide it.
[32:58.680 --> 32:59.680]  You tried to hide it.
[32:59.680 --> 33:04.320]  You kept the media away from the southern border, but they just have to walk right down
[33:04.320 --> 33:07.720]  to the southern border and they'll catch people walking across illegally.
[33:07.720 --> 33:12.560]  They go talk to ICE, they go talk to Border Patrol, they go talk to the illegal immigrants
[33:12.560 --> 33:13.560]  coming.
[33:13.560 --> 33:14.560]  They all tell the story.
[33:14.560 --> 33:15.560]  They say, yeah, we came here for Biden.
[33:15.560 --> 33:18.000]  ICE leaders, Border Patrol leaders say, yeah, Biden is doing this.
[33:18.000 --> 33:19.000]  It's Biden administration.
[33:19.000 --> 33:20.000]  They're collapsing our southern border.
[33:20.000 --> 33:21.000]  I don't know what you want us to do.
[33:21.000 --> 33:22.640]  There's nothing we can do.
[33:22.640 --> 33:23.640]  They're bringing in drugs.
[33:23.640 --> 33:24.640]  They're bringing in guns.
[33:24.640 --> 33:25.640]  They're child sex trafficking.
[33:25.640 --> 33:26.640]  It's all of it.
[33:26.640 --> 33:31.040]  It's all because of the Biden administration.
[33:31.040 --> 33:33.760]  It's an invasion.
[33:33.760 --> 33:37.080]  I feel bad for these oppressed people.
[33:37.080 --> 33:42.480]  I'm sad that their ancestors couldn't build a country that wouldn't oppress them and would
[33:42.480 --> 33:44.760]  allow them to prosper.
[33:44.760 --> 33:51.880]  Central America's a beautiful place, but their ancestors didn't provide them that future.
[33:51.880 --> 33:57.200]  So let them fight for it in Central America instead of coming here to collapse the United
[33:57.200 --> 33:59.880]  States into the hellhole that they came from.
[33:59.880 --> 34:01.560]  But that's all by design.
[34:01.560 --> 34:04.560]  But of course the political elite don't care.
[34:04.560 --> 34:06.160]  It'll never impact them.
[34:06.160 --> 34:09.480]  Central only enrich them.
[34:09.480 --> 34:12.680]  And then they just figure, hey, when we get absorbed by the world government, I'll have
[34:12.680 --> 34:14.160]  a seat at the table.
[34:14.160 --> 34:22.080]  They don't care about the eugenics that'll be run on kids.
[34:22.080 --> 34:31.280]  So it's very frustrating that there's not more of an uproar nationwide about this.
[34:31.280 --> 34:36.560]  But you know, there is, it's just not being properly covered.
[34:36.560 --> 34:47.720]  And you know, it's kind of highlighted, I think, in the fact that Donald Trump will
[34:47.720 --> 34:53.600]  go on Fox News today and talk about the crisis at the southern border.
[34:53.600 --> 35:00.560]  But you know, see that's actually the problem.
[35:00.560 --> 35:06.720]  There is an entire group of people organizing to be down there on Friday.
[35:06.720 --> 35:12.560]  And there's a list of speakers, a lot of very popular people on the conservative movement.
[35:12.560 --> 35:13.880]  But see, here's the problem.
[35:13.880 --> 35:16.880]  All of these people are considered alternative.
[35:16.880 --> 35:19.280]  So the mainstream news is an interest in them.
[35:19.280 --> 35:21.720]  They're the ones that are actually sounding the alarm.
[35:21.720 --> 35:24.040]  They're the ones that get that there's an agenda afoot.
[35:24.040 --> 35:27.240]  Sure, Fox News will show you the southern border being wide open and they'll show you
[35:27.240 --> 35:30.720]  the interviews of them saying it's, you know, they're coming here for Biden and they'll talk
[35:30.720 --> 35:32.360]  about it.
[35:32.360 --> 35:35.760]  But they'll never mention that this is an agenda to destroy the United States of America.
[35:35.760 --> 35:40.280]  Again, no, Mark Levin has a guest on last night, former ICE captain who says, yeah,
[35:40.280 --> 35:42.880]  this is an agenda to destroy the country.
[35:42.880 --> 35:44.840]  It's coming right out of the Biden White House.
[35:44.840 --> 35:50.480]  That should be like pressers, like nonstop around the clock, border patrol agents, ICE
[35:50.480 --> 35:52.920]  agents say Biden is destroying the country.
[35:52.920 --> 35:54.400]  And he is.
[35:54.400 --> 35:59.240]  It's kind of like the federal judge, the district court judge, excuse me, that came out and
[35:59.240 --> 36:02.720]  said the Democrats control the media, the Democrats control Hollywood.
[36:02.720 --> 36:03.720]  It's dangerous.
[36:03.720 --> 36:06.640]  And he made the decision at the New York Times where Sullivan, he wants it reversed because
[36:06.640 --> 36:13.160]  he sees the danger now that the Democrats control all the media and they rig elections
[36:13.160 --> 36:17.560]  and they caused racial strife and warfare.
[36:17.560 --> 36:22.760]  Story just got published, 12 year old boy hacked to death by a black man that was screaming
[36:22.760 --> 36:25.160]  death to white devils.
[36:25.160 --> 36:27.000]  Will Don Lemon feel responsible for that?
[36:27.000 --> 36:32.680]  Will CNN and MSNBC and the rest of the race baiting pimps, pimps for race war?
[36:32.680 --> 36:39.320]  Will they feel bad about another white boy murdered by a black man because of their rhetoric?
[36:39.320 --> 36:41.040]  Will they ever feel any remorse?
[36:41.040 --> 36:42.960]  No, they love it.
[36:42.960 --> 36:44.280]  It's what they want.
[36:44.280 --> 36:47.480]  It's what gets them off.
[36:47.480 --> 36:53.440]  When they promote racial violence, when they promote race war in this country, what do you
[36:53.440 --> 36:54.680]  think they want?
[36:54.680 --> 36:56.200]  They want whitey dead.
[36:56.200 --> 36:58.320]  They want the black guy to kill whitey.
[36:58.320 --> 37:02.000]  When they promote open borders, what do you think they want?
[37:02.000 --> 37:03.880]  They want an invasion.
[37:03.880 --> 37:07.400]  They want America to collapse.
[37:07.400 --> 37:09.320]  This is, this should be common knowledge.
[37:09.320 --> 37:12.920]  This should be understood by everyone, but you see, here's my point.
[37:12.920 --> 37:19.240]  So Trump goes on Fox News today, who promoted the steal of the election, who called Arizona
[37:19.240 --> 37:28.520]  first for Biden, who was anti-Trump in 2016 and was anti-Trump about 50% for 2020, but
[37:28.520 --> 37:31.600]  then Trump goes on Fox News.
[37:31.600 --> 37:35.280]  Trump doesn't come on info wars that promoted him and helped get him in the office.
[37:35.280 --> 37:39.360]  Trump doesn't go on the other alternative news networks that still have his back, that
[37:39.360 --> 37:42.440]  get banned and censored everywhere.
[37:42.440 --> 37:46.720]  And he goes on the milk toast Fox News.
[37:46.720 --> 37:51.000]  Fox News won't promote this event coming up on Friday.
[37:51.000 --> 37:52.240]  You probably can't even find it anywhere.
[37:52.240 --> 37:53.440]  It's banned everywhere.
[37:53.440 --> 37:55.960]  All the people that are organizing it are banned everywhere.
[37:55.960 --> 37:56.960]  They can't promote it.
[37:56.960 --> 37:57.960]  They get banned.
[37:57.960 --> 37:58.960]  They can't post flyers.
[37:58.960 --> 37:59.960]  They get banned.
[37:59.960 --> 38:03.920]  So it's literally just word of mouth and there'll still be thousands of people that
[38:03.920 --> 38:04.920]  show up.
[38:04.920 --> 38:12.920]  But see, oh, don't promote that, no, go promote Fox News that'll gladly participate in the
[38:12.920 --> 38:16.960]  theft of the 2020 election from you, Donald Trump.
[38:16.960 --> 38:22.480]  Go promote Fox News that did everything they possibly could to keep you out of office in
[38:22.480 --> 38:23.480]  2016.
[38:23.480 --> 38:28.240]  Yeah, go on with Fox News and continue to ignore the people that are actually fighting
[38:28.240 --> 38:30.880]  for this country.
[38:30.880 --> 38:34.680]  So that's just a microcosm of the problem.
[38:34.680 --> 38:38.920]  mainstream conservatives and Republicans still don't get it because they're still watching
[38:38.920 --> 38:43.120]  Fox News.
[38:43.120 --> 38:50.200]  But see, what's happening at the southern border is so big, it's impossible to ignore.
[38:50.200 --> 38:55.320]  And I don't know how else to really explain it.
[38:55.320 --> 39:03.360]  The Biden administration is committing open treason against this country by U.S. code.
[39:03.360 --> 39:09.480]  If I get caught smuggling someone across the southern border, I just committed a crime
[39:09.480 --> 39:11.440]  that's aiding and abetting.
[39:11.440 --> 39:17.080]  But when the Biden administration does it, that's just okay.
[39:17.080 --> 39:20.360]  They want you to panic about some fake pandemic for COVID.
[39:20.360 --> 39:24.520]  Really you're letting thousands, tens of thousands of people into this country that
[39:24.520 --> 39:27.840]  have tested positive for COVID and releasing them into the streets.
[39:27.840 --> 39:31.840]  How much do you really care about COVID?
[39:31.840 --> 39:38.400]  When you do basic math, if you have a welfare state and you have an open border, what is
[39:38.400 --> 39:39.400]  that equal?
[39:39.400 --> 39:43.160]  Well, that equals total bankruptcy.
[39:43.160 --> 39:49.000]  That means that you are now going to foot the bill for potentially six billion people
[39:49.000 --> 39:50.880]  on earth.
[39:50.880 --> 39:52.720]  You want to come into the United States of America?
[39:52.720 --> 39:53.720]  Come on in.
[39:53.720 --> 39:54.720]  You get a hotel room.
[39:54.720 --> 39:55.720]  You get a bus ride.
[39:55.720 --> 39:56.720]  You get a plane ride.
[39:56.720 --> 39:58.080]  You get a helicopter ride.
[39:58.080 --> 39:59.880]  You get a meal card.
[39:59.880 --> 40:01.720]  You get to stay in a facility.
[40:01.720 --> 40:06.320]  Who do you think's paying for that?
[40:06.320 --> 40:10.080]  It's open treason.
[40:10.080 --> 40:14.040]  Aiding and abetting crime.
[40:14.040 --> 40:17.560]  That's what the Biden administration is doing when they stop the border construction.
[40:17.560 --> 40:20.680]  That's what the Biden administration is doing when they promote the open borders.
[40:20.680 --> 40:21.680]  Come here.
[40:21.680 --> 40:23.200]  We'll let you in and we'll give you free stuff.
[40:23.200 --> 40:25.560]  That's open treason.
[40:25.560 --> 40:26.560]  You don't want to go that far.
[40:26.560 --> 40:30.840]  At the very least, it's aiding and abetting criminal activity.
[40:30.840 --> 40:33.080]  But what do you expect from criminals?
[40:33.080 --> 40:38.200]  Oh, but don't expect Biden to answer a question.
[40:38.200 --> 40:40.760]  Biden doesn't know where he is half the time.
[40:40.760 --> 40:42.840]  Biden can't do a press conference.
[40:42.840 --> 40:44.760]  Biden can't climb stairs.
[40:44.760 --> 40:46.280]  Biden can't walk.
[40:46.280 --> 40:47.840]  Biden can't talk.
[40:47.840 --> 40:51.280]  Biden can't think.
[40:51.280 --> 40:54.160]  So it's kind of a big deal, a national emergency.
[40:54.160 --> 40:56.680]  We have a president that can't think and we have a wide open southern border.
[40:56.680 --> 41:04.480]  This essential is all natural, all organic, high-end, quality, clean, self-care products.

[41:56.360 --> 42:02.960]  The New World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world government, but world government
[42:02.960 --> 42:05.360]  is only the control grid.
[42:05.360 --> 42:11.280]  Now, inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods
[42:11.280 --> 42:16.880]  and attain immortality, but the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination
[42:16.880 --> 42:20.000]  of all carbon-based line forms.
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.120]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[42:22.120 --> 42:25.840]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[42:25.840 --> 42:27.720]  They are playing God.
[42:27.720 --> 42:34.480]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology
[42:34.480 --> 42:37.480]  to carry out this transformation.
[42:37.480 --> 42:41.920]  I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings of the globalists, it's all on
[42:41.920 --> 42:42.920]  record.
[42:42.920 --> 42:45.360]  You have been warned.
[42:45.360 --> 42:49.840]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[42:49.840 --> 42:53.480]  This is the end of all life on Earth as we know it.
[42:53.480 --> 42:57.680]  This is the alien takeover of Earth.
[42:57.680 --> 43:01.440]  Listers ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[43:01.440 --> 43:04.040]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodine?
[43:04.040 --> 43:05.040]  Why do you do that?
[43:05.040 --> 43:07.280]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[43:07.280 --> 43:11.660]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep
[43:11.660 --> 43:15.720]  Earth pure crystal iodine, but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and
[43:15.720 --> 43:18.800]  the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[43:18.800 --> 43:19.800]  Boom.
[43:19.800 --> 43:20.800]  We did it.
[43:20.800 --> 43:21.800]  It's popular.
[43:21.800 --> 43:22.800]  It's X3.
[43:22.800 --> 43:23.800]  Is it better than X2?
[43:23.800 --> 43:24.800]  You decide.
[43:24.800 --> 43:25.800]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[43:25.800 --> 43:30.400]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleeping,
[43:30.400 --> 43:31.800]  and that is down and out.
[43:31.800 --> 43:36.720]  It's super strong, way stronger than knock out, but they don't compete with each other.
[43:36.720 --> 43:41.520]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas, and it's 40% off out of the gates

[43:57.720 --> 43:59.320]  The people are awakening.
[43:59.320 --> 44:02.000]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[44:02.000 --> 44:03.800]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[44:03.800 --> 44:08.800]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld, but big tech, large corporations, hackers,
[44:08.800 --> 44:10.520]  governments, foreign governments.
[44:10.520 --> 44:16.320]  Chicoms, especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able
[44:16.320 --> 44:20.760]  to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data that can actually
[44:20.760 --> 44:24.800]  predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[44:24.800 --> 44:31.360]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[44:31.360 --> 44:32.680]  In their own words, they admit it.
[44:32.680 --> 44:36.680]  So, I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more
[44:36.680 --> 44:39.680]  than a decade, and now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[44:39.680 --> 44:40.680]  They're faraday cages.
[44:40.680 --> 44:42.440]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[44:42.440 --> 44:47.080]  They work absolutely great, and it just gives you that security to have power over your
[44:47.080 --> 44:51.560]  data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother to
[44:51.560 --> 44:53.560]  know what you're up to because it's another business.
[44:53.560 --> 45:01.120]  Get yours at M4store.com today.
[45:01.120 --> 45:11.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[45:11.120 --> 45:18.040]  Tonight, that you and President Obama made a mistake about deportations.
[45:18.040 --> 45:19.720]  Why should Latinos trust you?
[45:19.720 --> 45:24.200]  What I would do as president is several more things because things have changed.
[45:24.200 --> 45:29.400]  I would, in fact, make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[45:29.400 --> 45:31.280]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[45:31.280 --> 45:32.280]  They deserve to be heard.
[45:32.280 --> 45:36.680]  That's who we are, where a nation says if you want to flee and you're fleeing oppression,
[45:36.680 --> 45:37.680]  you should come.
[45:37.680 --> 45:42.440]  A lot of the migrants coming in saying they're coming in because you promised to make things
[45:42.440 --> 45:43.440]  better.
[45:43.440 --> 45:46.080]  It seems to be getting worse by the day.
[45:46.080 --> 45:48.400]  Was it a mistake not to anticipate this surge?
[45:48.400 --> 45:54.520]  Well, first of all, there was a surge the last two years, and 19 and 20, there was a
[45:54.520 --> 45:55.520]  surge as well.
[45:55.520 --> 45:56.520]  This one might be worse.
[45:56.520 --> 45:59.040]  No, well, it could be, but here's the deal.
[45:59.040 --> 46:04.800]  We're sending back people to, first of all, the idea that Joe Biden said, come, because
[46:04.800 --> 46:09.600]  I heard the other day that they're coming because they know I'm a nice guy and I won't
[46:09.600 --> 46:10.600]  do it.
[46:10.600 --> 46:11.600]  They're saying this.
[46:11.600 --> 46:12.600]  Yeah.
[46:12.600 --> 46:13.600]  Well, here's the deal.
[46:13.600 --> 46:14.600]  They're not.
[46:14.600 --> 46:16.720]  Do you have to say quite clearly, don't come?
[46:16.720 --> 46:17.720]  Yes.
[46:17.720 --> 46:19.040]  I can say quite clearly, don't come.
[46:19.040 --> 46:25.040]  And what we're in the process of getting set up, don't leave your town or city or community.
[46:25.040 --> 46:28.320]  The chickens are coming home to roost.
[46:28.320 --> 46:32.600]  You know, I could say that America is having buyer's remorse with Joe Biden, but he didn't
[46:32.600 --> 46:33.600]  win this election.
[46:33.600 --> 46:39.720]  In fact, I was just talking to one of the top cybersecurity experts in the United States
[46:39.720 --> 46:44.200]  just two nights ago, and he's not ready to go public yet, but he's seriously considering
[46:44.200 --> 46:49.640]  going public and laying out the statistical fact that in the middle of the night, at least
[46:49.640 --> 46:55.720]  five states, you saw those spikes for Joe Biden, although it was massive concerted election
[46:55.720 --> 46:56.720]  fraud.
[46:56.720 --> 46:59.440]  They basically found what all the other experts have found as well, but that's a separate
[46:59.440 --> 47:00.840]  issue.
[47:00.840 --> 47:04.200]  People aren't getting buyers remorse because they didn't vote for Joe Biden.
[47:04.200 --> 47:06.600]  This was the biggest case of fraud this country's ever seen.
[47:06.600 --> 47:12.720]  And now the fraud of Biden falling down the stairs three times, the fraud of him not knowing
[47:12.720 --> 47:18.240]  who his granddaughter is or who his niece is, the fraud of him not knowing who the secretary
[47:18.240 --> 47:22.800]  of defense is or female generals that he's promoting are when they're right away on
[47:22.800 --> 47:32.240]  the podium shows that this puppet has basically gone way past its expiration date and is causing
[47:32.240 --> 47:33.740]  a huge crisis.
[47:33.740 --> 47:38.840]  They always plan to replace him down the road with Kamala Harris or somebody else like Nancy
[47:38.840 --> 47:39.840]  Pelosi.
[47:39.840 --> 47:41.760]  She said, I can become president.
[47:41.760 --> 47:47.840]  But now with him in office just two months, two months, I guess yesterday to the day,
[47:47.840 --> 47:54.720]  the whole country is in crisis and as John bound, one of his videos on info wars.com
[47:54.720 --> 47:58.560]  there, they said, Joe Biden is the crisis.
[47:58.560 --> 48:00.600]  We have nuclear weapons.
[48:00.600 --> 48:01.800]  We have all these nuclear reactors.
[48:01.800 --> 48:06.560]  We have all these complex systems that if we don't have competent people running things,
[48:06.560 --> 48:07.560]  things will fall apart.
[48:07.560 --> 48:11.640]  Why do you think third world nations can't make it because they get corrupt political
[48:11.640 --> 48:16.480]  elites in charge of them and then those corrupt political elites are above the law?
[48:16.480 --> 48:20.720]  They engage in election fraud or they set up a dictatorship and then there's never
[48:20.720 --> 48:27.720]  a way for any of the corruption or the ineptitude or for any of the ways for their bad management
[48:27.720 --> 48:29.880]  to be set right.
[48:29.880 --> 48:35.920]  And so America has gone over the edge of a cliff and as I predicted over a year ago,
[48:35.920 --> 48:41.240]  when you turn off the world economy completely for six months, partially for over a year,
[48:41.240 --> 48:43.600]  that causes collapse in the first world.
[48:43.600 --> 48:48.920]  First of all, the average yuppie is at home watching Netflix, getting favor delivered
[48:48.920 --> 48:51.080]  or Uber Eats.
[48:51.080 --> 48:54.480]  People that are delivering the food are going bankrupt and don't have money for gas for
[48:54.480 --> 49:00.040]  the car they're driving to deliver you the food and people in the third world are dying.
[49:00.040 --> 49:03.360]  And this is something that Tucker Carlson understands is why he's so popular.
[49:03.360 --> 49:04.360]  He's a populace.
[49:04.360 --> 49:08.320]  This is something also that of all people, Bill Maher understands.
[49:08.320 --> 49:13.080]  I don't like Bill Maher's leftist policies, his pro-abortion stuff, but Bill Maher sounds
[49:13.080 --> 49:15.360]  as good as Tucker Carlson right now.
[49:15.360 --> 49:19.680]  And you notice he's being criticized with a lefty as well for caring about the country
[49:19.680 --> 49:23.680]  and saying, well, politics is destroying us and saying that China has a completely masculine
[49:23.680 --> 49:27.920]  military and puts people in death camps.
[49:27.920 --> 49:31.240]  But then here in the United States, we're criticized and we're saying that white people
[49:31.240 --> 49:33.040]  are inherently evil and racist.
[49:33.040 --> 49:36.920]  This is all a smoke screen for the corruption of big tech and for China and for others.
[49:36.920 --> 49:42.360]  This whole Asia thing you've seen our Asians are being targeted, Asians are being murdered
[49:42.360 --> 49:43.880]  by white people.
[49:43.880 --> 49:48.160]  That's a smoke screen for the real crime wave we know going on against Asians.
[49:48.160 --> 49:52.360]  The New York Times is an article wanting to ban 4chan and wanting to ban Telegram because
[49:52.360 --> 49:57.960]  people shared some Asian joke memes on there claiming that's why this incel sex pervert
[49:57.960 --> 50:00.720]  wouldn't kill these innocent Asian women.
[50:00.720 --> 50:05.120]  Well, if you went to World Star Hip Hop or any of those big sites, all they're doing
[50:05.120 --> 50:07.680]  is playing knockout game with Asians.
[50:07.680 --> 50:09.680]  Should they shut down World Star Hip Hop?
[50:09.680 --> 50:10.680]  No.
[50:10.680 --> 50:15.320]  They shouldn't sit there and then blame other platforms that have posted things one-one
[50:15.320 --> 50:19.720]  millionth as bad and then say that it's all white on Asian crime spree.
[50:19.720 --> 50:23.760]  If you go to FBI statistics and these just came out a few days ago, it shows that it
[50:23.760 --> 50:27.280]  is a total myth that there is a white on Asian crime wave.
[50:27.280 --> 50:30.000]  In fact, it's one of the rarest forms of crime.
[50:30.000 --> 50:33.040]  The major crime wave is black on Asians.
[50:33.040 --> 50:36.920]  That's the way it's been for at least 30 years in this country because Asians moved into
[50:36.920 --> 50:41.720]  those poor neighborhoods and set up grocery stores and laundries and businesses and there's
[50:41.720 --> 50:46.080]  a lot of resentment and there's issues on both sides but the Asians don't deserve what's
[50:46.080 --> 50:47.080]  happening to them.
[50:47.080 --> 50:50.640]  The vast majority of black folks aren't attacking Asian businesses.
[50:50.640 --> 50:55.760]  It is a known stereotype that there is major friction between blacks and Asians and so
[50:55.760 --> 51:00.440]  to sit there and try to act like it's white people doing it out of 350 million Americans
[51:00.440 --> 51:05.320]  and other 40 million illegals that are here, 50 million to say that because a crazy dude
[51:05.320 --> 51:10.680]  went and killed these poor sex workers, that now that's a white on Asian thing, it's preposterous
[51:10.680 --> 51:16.120]  and it's to divert away from the real sex crimes that are taking place on our border.
[51:16.120 --> 51:20.680]  Under Obama, tens of thousands of children were placed with smugglers, were just allowed
[51:20.680 --> 51:24.360]  to come in and place with smugglers and many of them ended up in the sex trade, many ended
[51:24.360 --> 51:25.360]  up dead.
[51:25.360 --> 51:27.560]  That was in a Senate report five years ago.
[51:27.560 --> 51:33.920]  So you had Joe Biden going back just, I don't know, six months ago during the election five
[51:33.920 --> 51:39.480]  months ago and he said, if I get elected, you need to surge the border because I'm going
[51:39.480 --> 51:42.480]  to legalize you and he said it several times.
[51:42.480 --> 51:47.920]  So that was a clear directive, at least people show up in Biden shirts by the thousands organized
[51:47.920 --> 51:52.480]  by the UN, organized by the Democratic Party, organized by George Soros, it's the same stuff
[51:52.480 --> 51:54.720]  they were doing a few years ago but Trump blocked it.
[51:54.720 --> 51:58.680]  So he had record low illegal immigration because Trump said, we're going to deport you back
[51:58.680 --> 52:03.160]  to the country that you first came from or back to the nearest nation to be deported
[52:03.160 --> 52:07.000]  from there and he put pressure on Guatemala and Mexico and a bunch of the countries where
[52:07.000 --> 52:11.480]  they wouldn't get $500 million a year or a billion dollars a year depending on the country
[52:11.480 --> 52:14.760]  that we were giving him an aid if they didn't start doing that.
[52:14.760 --> 52:16.760]  And so we saw law and order.
[52:16.760 --> 52:23.800]  And so this is children being smuggled and we saw Saki last week saying, if you have
[52:23.800 --> 52:29.240]  a 10 year old with you or younger, it's again into the country, free car and she smiled
[52:29.240 --> 52:30.240]  about it.
[52:30.240 --> 52:35.480]  And knowing that all over Latin America, they're kidnapping children out of their backyards
[52:35.480 --> 52:39.240]  or out of the backs of school buses you name it, it's happening and they're being taken
[52:39.240 --> 52:46.600]  by smugglers up and then sold to the coyotes and for Democrats, that doesn't mean a smaller
[52:46.600 --> 52:50.480]  wolf species, they're called coyotes, those are the human smugglers.
[52:50.480 --> 52:55.600]  And then some children they've confirmed have been across and back over 30 times.
[52:55.600 --> 52:59.040]  Many of them are found dead, some were as young as two years of age and so they are
[52:59.040 --> 53:03.880]  using these children as they get into the country free card and this is evil.
[53:03.880 --> 53:06.960]  And so again, it's not buyer's remorse because America didn't vote for this guy, but for
[53:06.960 --> 53:10.040]  the people that went along with it, for the mainstream media that went along with it,
[53:10.040 --> 53:13.520]  they are seeing the American people totally turn against them because sure, they may be
[53:13.520 --> 53:16.880]  able to steal the next election because of HR1 if that goes through, they may be able
[53:16.880 --> 53:18.000]  to keep their fraud going.
[53:18.000 --> 53:22.880]  But what are they going to do when reality comes crashing in on them?
[53:22.880 --> 53:26.400]  And the answer is they're going to try to stage race war, they're going to try to stage
[53:26.400 --> 53:29.520]  false flags, they're going to try to demonize their opposition.
[53:29.520 --> 53:35.280]  The Army is now training that if you think Black Lives Matter and its riots is the same
[53:35.280 --> 53:38.920]  thing as the Capitol riot, that you are a white supremacist.
[53:38.920 --> 53:43.760]  If you think George Soros is Black Lives Matter that got $10.6 billion last year and burned
[53:43.760 --> 53:48.280]  down large parts of major cities across the U.S., if you think that that is on par with
[53:48.280 --> 53:52.840]  the Capitol, it's actually much smaller with actual violence, then you're a terrorist basically.
[53:52.840 --> 53:57.480]  Then in truth, that's a scythe, it's not even on par, it's way, way, way, way, way worse
[53:57.480 --> 54:03.160]  what VLM and Antifa did, but again, we have Joe Bayhar and Nadler saying Antifa doesn't
[54:03.160 --> 54:04.160]  even exist.
[54:04.160 --> 54:08.480]  Imagine if we said the Capitol riot didn't really exist, well the way they exaggerated
[54:08.480 --> 54:12.000]  it didn't exist, but some bad things happened there and I didn't endorse that.
[54:12.000 --> 54:18.760]  So again, the gaslighting isn't working and emblematic of that is Joe Biden, if they had
[54:18.760 --> 54:23.480]  a well-spoken good-looking man or woman up there who stole the election, they might have
[54:23.480 --> 54:28.560]  a chance to actually keep this fraud going, but the fact that he's so weak, so pathetic,
[54:28.560 --> 54:32.760]  so ridiculous, the fact that Kamala only got half a percentage point vote for Democrats
[54:32.760 --> 54:37.400]  back in the primary shows the establishment is totally disconnected and believes they
[54:37.400 --> 54:39.640]  can engage in whatever fraud they want, whenever they want.
[54:39.640 --> 54:44.640]  So the lARPing, the playing along by Democrats that they're part of the system is coming
[54:44.640 --> 54:49.160]  home to roost that it's not true and that indeed they got suckered and so there's a
[54:49.160 --> 54:54.960]  huge populist awakening, Tucker Carlson knows that, of course people like Bill Maher know
[54:54.960 --> 54:59.320]  that, I know that, you know that and we really should come together, pass Joe Biden, pass
[54:59.320 --> 55:04.360]  Donald Trump and stop letting figureheads get us into a fight and really think about
[55:04.360 --> 55:09.320]  basic liberties, basic freedoms, the horrible force inoculations, the lockdowns, the global
[55:09.320 --> 55:14.760]  government, the starving third world and all the things that are affecting us in reality,
[55:14.760 --> 55:15.760]  okay?
[55:15.760 --> 55:18.720]  Trump did some good things overall, I'm glad I supported him overall and I hope he can
[55:18.720 --> 55:22.600]  keep the Republican Party populist and that, you know, we continue to build that beach
[55:22.600 --> 55:28.000]  and but we can't just keep counting on him and all these fantasy groups in the government
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.720]  to save us, we have to start changing our lives like all the people filing suit in Virginia
[55:32.720 --> 55:37.560]  and New York and Michigan and California and winning in court that these lockdowns are
[55:37.560 --> 55:39.120]  unconstitutional.
[55:39.120 --> 55:43.800]  We need to champion that and stop complying with orders that are not constitutional and
[55:43.800 --> 55:46.480]  that are fraudulent and they're designed to shut down our real economy.
[55:46.480 --> 55:50.560]  College Jones here with the new info or sale and it is a fantastic sale.
[55:50.560 --> 55:54.680]  It is many of our best selling products that just so happened to also be selling out but

[56:48.560 --> 56:52.600]  Throughout history there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes
[56:52.600 --> 56:53.600]  of the two.
[56:53.600 --> 56:56.680]  One is born of Renaissance, the other is born of Conquest.
[56:56.680 --> 57:02.320]  One bases its power on having a strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture
[57:02.320 --> 57:05.720]  and ingenuity, art and skill and strength.
[57:05.720 --> 57:10.960]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above
[57:10.960 --> 57:11.960]  it.
[57:11.960 --> 57:17.240]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one
[57:17.240 --> 57:20.240]  of total mass high-tech slavery.
[57:20.240 --> 57:23.800]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[57:23.800 --> 57:27.560]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave
[57:27.560 --> 57:28.560]  masters.
[57:28.560 --> 57:32.800]  The global permanent lockdown is here, it's already causing millions and millions to starve
[57:32.800 --> 57:33.800]  to death.
[57:33.800 --> 57:36.000]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[57:36.000 --> 57:39.640]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and the top general have come out
[57:39.640 --> 57:43.880]  and said the COVID lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[57:43.880 --> 57:44.880]  That's the facts.
[57:44.880 --> 57:50.720]  This is the Bill Gates new world order weapon.
[57:50.720 --> 58:05.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[58:05.000 --> 58:09.840]  I want to follow up with a couple things that Alex covered in that last segment.
[58:09.840 --> 58:16.000]  And then I've got this stack of fake pandemic COVID news that is just mind blowing.
[58:16.000 --> 58:21.760]  First, he mentioned the demasculization and we showed some articles there of the United
[58:21.760 --> 58:23.360]  States military versus the Chinese military.
[58:23.360 --> 58:28.120]  And guys, if you just want to roll the B roll there, a Chinese military recruitment
[58:28.120 --> 58:36.080]  video has just been kind of going viral and people are noticing that the Chinese military
[58:36.080 --> 58:45.280]  is very masculine in their recruitment videos and they don't even show a single woman, isn't
[58:45.280 --> 58:46.280]  that amazing?
[58:46.280 --> 58:53.680]  Meanwhile, our military is being forced to pay for transsexual surgeries, wear high heels
[58:53.680 --> 58:55.680]  and other such nonsense.
[58:55.680 --> 59:02.400]  But the Chinese People's Liberation Army is putting out promotional videos that don't
[59:02.400 --> 59:04.480]  even feature a woman.
[59:04.480 --> 59:06.840]  So that may or may not tell you something.
[59:06.840 --> 59:10.920]  And then I have this video and this is a very odd one really just shows the complete breakdown
[59:10.920 --> 59:13.160]  of civilization here in clip one.
[59:13.160 --> 59:20.560]  A Filipino man is berated as a Chinese man by a white supremacist, wink, wink, check
[59:20.560 --> 59:26.880]  out this white supremacist, wink, wink, berating and harassing an Asian man on the New York
[59:26.880 --> 59:27.880]  subway.
[59:27.880 --> 59:49.860]  It must have been a reason for that.
[59:49.860 --> 59:50.400]  because it's the white supremacist.
[59:50.400 --> 1:00:01.440]  uh... it's not a white man it's a black man
[1:00:01.440 --> 1:00:04.440]  and then of course he's touching the railing on the subway and then touching
[1:00:04.440 --> 1:00:07.520]  his mask that's good that's like just like you might have a lick the railing
[1:00:07.520 --> 1:00:10.000]  uh... but that's another story
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:13.360]  the strange thing about this most the stuff that this black guy on the subway
[1:00:13.360 --> 1:00:16.920]  saying is actually true he's calling out the chinese communist arresting and
[1:00:16.920 --> 1:00:18.160]  killing black people
[1:00:18.160 --> 1:00:21.120]  uh... you know arresting and detaining muslims and all the other stuff that
[1:00:21.120 --> 1:00:24.200]  they have in the slave camp so he's like right on but it's like
[1:00:24.200 --> 1:00:29.880]  why are you directing that at this guy sitting on a subway
[1:00:29.880 --> 1:00:32.200]  like what is that
[1:00:32.200 --> 1:00:32.920]  this guy
[1:00:32.920 --> 1:00:35.200]  maybe a little bit out of his mind
[1:00:35.200 --> 1:00:38.360]  based on what he's wearing
[1:00:38.360 --> 1:00:42.320]  but so it's just crazy times to be alive
[1:00:42.320 --> 1:00:44.560]  uh... but there's a white supremacist
[1:00:44.560 --> 1:00:47.040]  uh... harassing an asian man on the train but
[1:00:47.040 --> 1:00:48.680]  everything you said is true
[1:00:48.680 --> 1:00:51.240]  uh... but again why are you yelling at this guy on a train that doesn't really
[1:00:51.240 --> 1:00:52.920]  make sense
[1:00:52.920 --> 1:00:56.120]  uh... so but when we come back i'm gonna get into this
[1:00:56.120 --> 1:00:58.120]  stack of the fake pandemic
[1:00:58.120 --> 1:01:01.640]  uh... news developments that's just gonna blow your mind
[1:01:01.640 --> 1:01:03.240]  but here's here's
[1:01:03.240 --> 1:01:06.640]  part of the issue we face and i've talked about this a lot
[1:01:06.640 --> 1:01:09.360]  we are in a race against time
[1:01:09.360 --> 1:01:12.640]  imagine it as two wicks
[1:01:12.640 --> 1:01:15.080]  going towards a big firework
[1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:20.520]  which you know burned pretty slow you've got time to run or whatever
[1:01:20.520 --> 1:01:24.640]  you've got the wick of the globalists
[1:01:24.640 --> 1:01:28.120]  which has been burning slow burning to get to this firework which is the
[1:01:28.120 --> 1:01:31.600]  explosion of humanity into the new age with all the technology the life
[1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:33.400]  extensions everything
[1:01:33.400 --> 1:01:36.560]  that they've just been sitting on
[1:01:36.560 --> 1:01:39.480]  and you've got the globalist that are that are that whose wicks been building
[1:01:39.480 --> 1:01:42.760]  and they're they want to be in control of that explosion
[1:01:42.760 --> 1:01:46.000]  so that when it happens and humanity enters this new era
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:50.660]  they'll be in total control and humanity will be enslaved by the elite
[1:01:50.660 --> 1:01:54.960]  then you have the we the people that the citizens of earth the average joe the
[1:01:54.960 --> 1:01:56.200]  average jail
[1:01:56.200 --> 1:02:00.200]  and now we're awakening and our wick is burning fast getting that explosion but
[1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:03.720]  it's a race against time and so here's the analogy
[1:02:03.720 --> 1:02:06.760]  dan bongino is taking over rush limbaugh's time slot a lot of those
[1:02:06.760 --> 1:02:09.200]  stations not really taking over for rush limbaugh
[1:02:09.200 --> 1:02:13.320]  it at my guess won't have near the success but banjino very popular on the internet
[1:02:13.320 --> 1:02:16.120]  and he will have success in that radio slot
[1:02:16.120 --> 1:02:19.640]  and he's much more hardcore than rush
[1:02:19.640 --> 1:02:23.920]  i'm a big fan of rush happens as i was a kid love rush and miss him every day
[1:02:23.920 --> 1:02:25.760]  uh... i like dan bongino
[1:02:25.760 --> 1:02:29.360]  and banjino is more hardcore against the deep state in the new world order than
[1:02:29.360 --> 1:02:30.280]  rush limbaugh
[1:02:30.280 --> 1:02:31.820]  here's the problem
[1:02:31.820 --> 1:02:35.520]  even dan bongino is not hardcore enough to defeat these people
[1:02:35.520 --> 1:02:38.480]  and i love dan bongino
[1:02:38.480 --> 1:02:42.120]  it's the info wars narrative that's the hardcore
[1:02:42.120 --> 1:02:44.960]  information warfare that can defeat the new world order
[1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:48.720]  and until everyone gets in this mindset that we have here at info wars
[1:02:48.720 --> 1:02:51.380]  not saying we're perfect but we understand the enemy
[1:02:51.380 --> 1:02:58.380]  until everyone gets that mindset then can our wick burn fast enough
[1:02:59.600 --> 1:03:03.360]  randy do write randy do write thanks for holding her on the air
[1:03:03.360 --> 1:03:08.960]  and first of all let me say i'd love your products i am a granny and um... brawling
[1:03:08.960 --> 1:03:13.000]  senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me i
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:17.600]  was loaded up the sun spot rage hot as they're lovingly called but
[1:03:17.600 --> 1:03:22.440]  taking your x two for the last couple of years my skin is just really gorgeous
[1:03:22.440 --> 1:03:26.120]  actually people think i'm fifty five years old
[1:03:26.120 --> 1:03:30.080]  and i was already taking your other supplement but i thought you know well
[1:03:30.080 --> 1:03:33.920]  maybe that's what i need to do because i just thought it was a hopeless situation
[1:03:33.920 --> 1:03:38.240]  but when i started taking it me doesn't happen immediately but you know over a
[1:03:38.240 --> 1:03:43.120]  period of time i started noticing okay you know this is a ticket this is
[1:03:43.120 --> 1:03:48.080]  working this is wonderful you know i don't i don't have to put on derma blend
[1:03:48.080 --> 1:03:52.840]  anymore you know so anyway it worked wonderfully and it really has totally
[1:03:52.840 --> 1:03:57.840]  cleared up my skin
[1:03:57.840 --> 1:04:02.160]  we now take you live to the central texas command center
[1:04:02.160 --> 1:04:06.160]  and the heart of the resistance and now your hopes
[1:04:06.160 --> 1:04:11.600]  all right ladies and gentlemen we are into the second hour of the alex jones
[1:04:11.600 --> 1:04:16.320]  show i actually have i told my producer here i'm doing double duty today
[1:04:16.320 --> 1:04:20.000]  hosting alex jones show and then the war room later today i have enough news
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:23.520]  today to cover six or seven hours of news so i'm gonna maybe even struggle to
[1:04:23.520 --> 1:04:25.360]  get through all of it
[1:04:25.360 --> 1:04:30.960]  but i have in front of me a stack of the fake pandemic covid news here
[1:04:30.960 --> 1:04:34.720]  that is really quite frankly mind boggling and
[1:04:34.720 --> 1:04:40.560]  if everybody could understand this if this could go mainstream
[1:04:40.560 --> 1:04:45.200]  and people could actually consume this rationally logically without their
[1:04:45.200 --> 1:04:49.840]  preconditioned bias it would be game over and i see all these people celebrating
[1:04:49.840 --> 1:04:52.480]  new new zealand reopened back up and they've got big
[1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:56.640]  concerts and all the lift lebs lift lefty libs are saying
[1:04:56.640 --> 1:05:00.160]  see new zealand followed the science and massed and vaccinated now they get to
[1:05:00.160 --> 1:05:02.880]  be open we could have been open the whole time
[1:05:02.880 --> 1:05:06.160]  i've been open the whole time
[1:05:06.240 --> 1:05:09.120]  you've embraced tyranny remember obama said there's no tyranny lurking around
[1:05:09.120 --> 1:05:13.040]  the corner uh oh here it is yep you just experienced it and now
[1:05:13.040 --> 1:05:17.680]  people are celebrating the tyranny she just go along with the tyranny it's
[1:05:17.680 --> 1:05:20.720]  better for everyone
[1:05:20.720 --> 1:05:23.600]  never
[1:05:23.600 --> 1:05:28.400]  but so let's get into some of this covid nonsense today
[1:05:28.400 --> 1:05:33.200]  according to the world meters on new cases
[1:05:33.200 --> 1:05:37.040]  new cases are at record lows for covid in the united states of america nobody's
[1:05:37.040 --> 1:05:39.840]  talking about that nobody's celebrating that because that's not part of the
[1:05:39.840 --> 1:05:43.280]  agenda and the states that have the most new cases
[1:05:43.280 --> 1:05:47.840]  are not florida or texas that are wide open
[1:05:47.840 --> 1:05:52.720]  or california with the most population no it's new york and new jersey
[1:05:52.720 --> 1:05:56.400]  where they still have the strictest lockdowns and strictest
[1:05:56.400 --> 1:06:02.800]  mask measures and of course probably the most inflated cases
[1:06:02.800 --> 1:06:07.920]  so just keep that in the back of your mind again it's all just the flu anyway
[1:06:07.920 --> 1:06:14.720]  here's some data out of out of sweden and chechia
[1:06:14.720 --> 1:06:20.320]  where it shows sweden with 18 mass compliance down here at virtually zero
[1:06:20.320 --> 1:06:25.440]  covid now and you have chechia which has 86
[1:06:25.440 --> 1:06:30.720]  percent mass compliance still at highs for covid why would that be because
[1:06:30.720 --> 1:06:40.320]  masks spread disease masks spread disease masks spread
[1:06:40.320 --> 1:06:45.920]  disease and fouchi knows this he wrote scientific papers on this so why would
[1:06:45.920 --> 1:06:49.840]  that dirtbag rat be telling you to wear two masks
[1:06:49.840 --> 1:06:53.520]  i think a criminal investigation may be needed for crimes against humanity
[1:06:53.520 --> 1:06:58.480]  into anthony fouchi i go on look at some of the torture
[1:06:58.480 --> 1:07:02.000]  here's your crime against humanity for this fake pandemic
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:08.160]  from a student this is at the college fix i've tested negative for covid 17
[1:07:08.160 --> 1:07:11.920]  times this semester my school still forces me to wear a mask
[1:07:11.920 --> 1:07:18.480]  outside and alone so imagine that and this is at every university
[1:07:18.480 --> 1:07:22.080]  imagine that at every university they're making you take
[1:07:22.080 --> 1:07:27.200]  17 nose swabs which is not good for you folks it's not good to be
[1:07:27.200 --> 1:07:32.800]  shoving a thing up your nose it's not it does damage to your sinuses and other
[1:07:32.800 --> 1:07:35.920]  such things but so they just do that 17 times a semester
[1:07:35.920 --> 1:07:38.960]  nobody's testing positive and they say still wear the mask still take the test
[1:07:38.960 --> 1:07:42.800]  every day disgusting how we treat ourselves like
[1:07:42.800 --> 1:07:45.040]  slaves we've just totally embraced our medical
[1:07:45.040 --> 1:07:48.640]  charity totally embraced our slavery to covid
[1:07:48.640 --> 1:07:53.600]  oh and how do you think this one's gonna go robot doctors take over hospital to
[1:07:53.600 --> 1:07:56.560]  reduce covid spread and so now they have the little
[1:07:56.560 --> 1:08:00.240]  dog robot with a tablet on it like a face
[1:08:00.240 --> 1:08:04.080]  and now that's your doctor you know to stop the spread of covid
[1:08:04.080 --> 1:08:07.440]  so now you'll have robot doctors being brought in
[1:08:07.440 --> 1:08:10.160]  because of covid so you won't even see a human anymore
[1:08:10.160 --> 1:08:13.040]  that'll only be for the rich elite politicians that'll only be for the
[1:08:13.040 --> 1:08:16.800]  rich elite hollywood actors and actresses to see an actual doctor
[1:08:16.800 --> 1:08:20.960]  you're gonna you're gonna get some ai robot machine
[1:08:20.960 --> 1:08:25.520]  telling you what you need to do oh that'll be fun
[1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:28.560]  israeli jews petition international criminal court
[1:08:28.560 --> 1:08:32.320]  say israel's mandatory covid vaccines violate nirnberg code
[1:08:32.320 --> 1:08:36.880]  yes every country needs to follow and i'm not a big fan of greg abbott but he
[1:08:36.880 --> 1:08:40.480]  has been emphatic that the state of texas will never
[1:08:40.480 --> 1:08:44.880]  force vaccinate anyone so god bless texas for that
[1:08:44.880 --> 1:08:49.200]  but in israel it's like the nazis have taken over and they are now forcing
[1:08:49.200 --> 1:08:53.520]  everybody to take the covid vaccine in order to get their freedoms back
[1:08:53.520 --> 1:08:56.960]  yeah that's a crime against humanity it violates the nirnberg code
[1:08:56.960 --> 1:09:01.200]  anybody responsible for that needs to go to jail
[1:09:01.200 --> 1:09:06.480]  uh but they're embraced as heroes for taking all of our freedoms
[1:09:06.480 --> 1:09:09.920]  story at info wars dot com with the peer reviewed study
[1:09:09.920 --> 1:09:14.800]  trust the science peer reviewed studies suggest cdc inflated covet 19 fatalities
[1:09:14.800 --> 1:09:18.160]  that's right just like we reported gunshot deaths were coveted
[1:09:18.160 --> 1:09:21.600]  getting run over by a car was coveted drowning was coveted
[1:09:21.600 --> 1:09:25.040]  being 110 years old was coveted it was all coveted
[1:09:25.040 --> 1:09:28.640]  and it was also the hospitals could get payouts we had that story
[1:09:28.640 --> 1:09:33.280]  a year ago but now the real scientists and researchers and peer reviewed studies
[1:09:33.280 --> 1:09:36.640]  are coming out saying yep it was all a fake pandemic
[1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:41.920]  it doesn't stop there former fda commissioner social distancing was
[1:09:41.920 --> 1:09:45.440]  costly and was never based on clear science that's right
[1:09:45.440 --> 1:09:48.080]  and now all the people that promoted it new york times washington post
[1:09:48.080 --> 1:09:51.120]  they're looking around saying who first said six feet where did this came from
[1:09:51.120 --> 1:09:53.600]  well i don't know i thought you did and i don't know i thought you did it
[1:09:53.600 --> 1:09:56.880]  nobody knows where did six feet come from it was never scientific
[1:09:56.880 --> 1:10:00.640]  it was always made up and it all came out of that rats
[1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:04.160]  behind anthony fowchee
[1:10:07.040 --> 1:10:13.840]  moving on coveted vaccine motivation crispy cream is giving away free
[1:10:13.840 --> 1:10:20.080]  donuts for showing vaccination card gross
[1:10:20.720 --> 1:10:24.960]  so this is going to become the new marketing um campaign i'm i'm guessing
[1:10:24.960 --> 1:10:28.320]  is going to be mocked that starts with crispy cream

[1:11:12.320 --> 1:11:15.600]  they admit this is all experimental and we don't know
[1:11:15.600 --> 1:11:19.360]  and they even get into the side effects

[1:16:16.640 --> 1:16:21.840]  covid news here but we've got major world developments happening right now
[1:16:21.840 --> 1:16:25.840]  and the world is destabilizing by design that's why the un says build back
[1:16:25.840 --> 1:16:30.320]  better and then all the uh political operatives of the un
[1:16:30.320 --> 1:16:33.120]  promote the build back better campaign including joe biden
[1:16:33.120 --> 1:16:36.800]  but yeah they see the united states destabilizing they see it destabilized
[1:16:36.800 --> 1:16:39.360]  by design they know biden isn't stable he could
[1:16:39.360 --> 1:16:42.320]  pop off at any moment a war could start at any moment and it's just like the
[1:16:42.320 --> 1:16:45.200]  whole world is destabilizing because the united states of america is
[1:16:45.200 --> 1:16:48.320]  destabilizing because we have an unstable president
[1:16:48.320 --> 1:16:51.760]  so the border is collapsing the economy could collapse at any minute
[1:16:51.760 --> 1:16:56.800]  and and biden is up there uh napping asleep at the switch
[1:16:56.800 --> 1:17:00.960]  and it's all by design so uh i'll get to some of that world developing news
[1:17:00.960 --> 1:17:05.600]  world development news coming up here shortly and some other political news
[1:17:05.600 --> 1:17:08.880]  coming out of the democrat party but i want to finish this
[1:17:08.880 --> 1:17:16.320]  so the story at bloomberg again
[1:17:16.320 --> 1:17:22.560]  saying that it's not a vaccine it's experimental technology
[1:17:22.560 --> 1:17:25.920]  it's risky i mean covering all of it right there in bloomberg but oh matter
[1:17:25.920 --> 1:17:28.400]  of fact and it's just okay and we just go along with it don't
[1:17:28.400 --> 1:17:31.840]  worry about it don't ask any other questions
[1:17:31.840 --> 1:17:36.400]  uh it's not totally effective they even admit it but you know it's good
[1:17:36.400 --> 1:17:39.680]  it's good we're testing this on you it's good you're a human guinea pig
[1:17:39.680 --> 1:17:43.360]  for big pharma that's that that makes billions of dollars a day
[1:17:43.360 --> 1:17:49.120]  that's a good thing for you but that was out of left-leaning bloomberg
[1:17:49.760 --> 1:17:53.200]  now another one this one didn't really have people
[1:17:53.200 --> 1:17:58.880]  as upset the liberals reading it they thought it's cool oh i'm getting
[1:17:58.880 --> 1:18:02.080]  oh i'm getting brand new technology oh i'm elite woohoo
[1:18:02.080 --> 1:18:06.160]  yeah you you're you're a slave is what you are
[1:18:06.160 --> 1:18:10.160]  but then you had this individual professor emily
[1:18:10.160 --> 1:18:16.240]  oster write a piece for the atlantic again uh this is
[1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:22.240]  more hardcore left-leaning even kids are low risk go ahead and plan the summer
[1:18:22.240 --> 1:18:25.200]  plan a family vacation with your unvaccinated kids
[1:18:25.200 --> 1:18:33.600]  and oh my gosh the response the hate this the attacks that this lady got
[1:18:33.600 --> 1:18:36.720]  and you go look at her story in the atlantic it's all just science
[1:18:36.720 --> 1:18:40.000]  it's all just data she just totally gets all the data compiles it and says
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:43.040]  you know what it's safe to go on the vacation this year congratulations
[1:18:43.040 --> 1:18:47.920]  and the liberals hate it we don't want the data we don't want the science we
[1:18:47.920 --> 1:18:52.240]  don't want a vacation we want fear we want vaccines we want
[1:18:52.240 --> 1:18:56.480]  everybody shut in and shut down and it just shows you
[1:18:56.480 --> 1:19:00.640]  everything these people are about they hate human freedom
[1:19:00.640 --> 1:19:04.400]  they hate human activity they hate a smiling face
[1:19:04.400 --> 1:19:08.880]  they hate the the light of god and the light of divine creation
[1:19:08.880 --> 1:19:12.320]  that you can see in someone's eyes and in their soul and their facial
[1:19:12.320 --> 1:19:16.320]  expressions they hate all of it they don't want you to go on a
[1:19:16.320 --> 1:19:19.920]  vacation vacation they don't want you to go back
[1:19:19.920 --> 1:19:23.520]  to school they don't want you to go to that concert or that ball game
[1:19:23.520 --> 1:19:27.840]  they want you vaccinated and they want you enslaved staying in your home like
[1:19:27.840 --> 1:19:32.640]  a good sheep because that's who they are
[1:19:32.640 --> 1:19:37.200]  it's scary it's horrifying it's unhuman
[1:19:37.200 --> 1:19:44.400]  i don't recognize it it's alien it's foreign it's it's it's
[1:19:44.400 --> 1:19:47.280]  it's deviant
[1:19:47.840 --> 1:19:51.760]  and until it is stood up to and in brash force
[1:19:51.760 --> 1:19:55.680]  and totally rejected it will conquer our
[1:19:55.680 --> 1:20:00.640]  society that's why you have cardi b with her song
[1:20:00.640 --> 1:20:05.280]  wop doing softcore porn videos for children
[1:20:05.280 --> 1:20:08.720]  and then you go down to the spring breakers in miami and it's and it's
[1:20:08.720 --> 1:20:14.080]  hundreds of women stripping naked and shaking their butt like cardi b the
[1:20:14.080 --> 1:20:18.640]  total de evolution of society the total
[1:20:18.640 --> 1:20:24.560]  degradation the total degeneration of society brought to you by Hollywood
[1:20:24.560 --> 1:20:28.000]  brought to you by the liberal left
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:31.520]  they want you to be worn down depressed
[1:20:31.520 --> 1:20:34.720]  oppressed and enslaved because that's who
[1:20:34.720 --> 1:20:40.480]  they are slaves to their father satan
[1:20:41.120 --> 1:20:46.960]  moving on because this explains why we have to deal with the fake
[1:20:46.960 --> 1:20:54.000]  pandemic federal judge alleges kind of
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:21:01.120]  alleges no he calls it out but this is the epoch times headline
[1:21:01.120 --> 1:21:04.800]  federal judge allows alleges democrats are close to controlling
[1:21:04.800 --> 1:21:11.120]  all major news outlets no uh federal judge calls out the fact
[1:21:11.120 --> 1:21:13.760]  that the democrats control all mainstream news outlets
[1:21:13.760 --> 1:21:18.160]  that's what this federal judge did who was part of the new york times versulavan
[1:21:18.160 --> 1:21:21.840]  decision which he now regrets saying that the media is now a
[1:21:21.840 --> 1:21:25.200]  monopolistic political power and it needs to be
[1:21:25.200 --> 1:21:29.600]  reformed it's not good it's dangerous it's going to destroy america
[1:21:29.600 --> 1:21:34.000]  so people are getting it it's kind of like you have border patrol and ice
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:36.720]  agents going on record saying i can't believe this is happening at the
[1:21:36.720 --> 1:21:39.280]  southern border the biden administration is committing treason
[1:21:39.280 --> 1:21:42.800]  they've got the border wide open this is a national emergency by biden is to
[1:21:42.800 --> 1:21:45.600]  blame now you have federal judge saying the
[1:21:45.600 --> 1:21:48.320]  democrats control all media they're killing free speech they're
[1:21:48.320 --> 1:21:52.320]  centering their opposition and they're promoting their propaganda 24-7
[1:21:52.320 --> 1:21:56.320]  which is new world order propaganda one world government propaganda un
[1:21:56.320 --> 1:21:59.040]  propaganda race baiting propaganda pro china
[1:21:59.040 --> 1:22:03.280]  propaganda never based in reality or truth never based in logic or common
[1:22:03.280 --> 1:22:07.600]  sense never with the basic principles and foundation of freedom
[1:22:07.600 --> 1:22:11.360]  never so yeah kind of a big deal when a federal judge
[1:22:11.360 --> 1:22:15.200]  who was the key decision in the new york times versulavan
[1:22:15.200 --> 1:22:20.160]  landmark case says that the democrat party and their control of the media is
[1:22:20.160 --> 1:22:23.520]  a threat to america kind of a big deal
[1:22:23.520 --> 1:22:28.080]  but see this is part of the process that i'm talking about america's waking up
[1:22:28.080 --> 1:22:30.800]  people are coming out of their holes they're coming out of their shells
[1:22:30.800 --> 1:22:33.920]  they're coming out from under the rock they're taking their head out from under
[1:22:33.920 --> 1:22:37.600]  the sand or up their ass wherever it's been and they're saying this is not
[1:22:37.600 --> 1:22:41.520]  good there is a serious problem happening here
[1:22:41.520 --> 1:22:45.840]  so the awakening is exploding forward but the new world order
[1:22:45.840 --> 1:22:52.400]  has always been 40 years ahead of us so they've got like a tiny little gap
[1:22:52.400 --> 1:22:57.200]  before they get control of the world we've got a massive gap to make up
[1:22:57.200 --> 1:23:01.600]  to beat them to the punch and even though it's dead on arrival it
[1:23:01.600 --> 1:23:05.040]  doesn't even matter they're still rolling it out i mean look at biden
[1:23:05.040 --> 1:23:10.240]  falling down flights of steps not doing press conferences can't even talk
[1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:15.120]  oh but it looks like the democrats may have the ouster coming soon for biden
[1:23:15.120 --> 1:23:19.840]  i'm going to talk about that coming up china using covet 19 vaccine to push
[1:23:19.840 --> 1:23:23.760]  huawei in latin america southern command warns
[1:23:23.760 --> 1:23:28.320]  so yeah oh we're going to bring in huawei and we'll make deals with you and we'll
[1:23:28.320 --> 1:23:33.600]  give you our 5g but just here you know take our vaccines
[1:23:33.600 --> 1:23:37.440]  and we'll make a deal a good deal with you with huawei just go under our control
[1:23:37.440 --> 1:23:44.160]  and we'll bring you huawei uh guarantee you biden won't say a thing about that
[1:23:44.160 --> 1:23:48.320]  and of course as alex mentioned earlier china the big trade winner from
[1:23:48.320 --> 1:23:51.680]  lockdowns in the west that's out of the telegraph so yeah
[1:23:51.680 --> 1:23:55.840]  the left and china control our media they just faked a pandemic
[1:23:55.840 --> 1:24:00.960]  china came out on top go figure so china the adversary of the united states
[1:24:00.960 --> 1:24:05.600]  controls our white house now owns biden controls our media owns our media
[1:24:05.600 --> 1:24:10.160]  controls our hollywood owns our hollywood controls our sports leagues
[1:24:10.160 --> 1:24:13.280]  and any celebrity that sold out that wants to get into the chinese market
[1:24:13.280 --> 1:24:17.680]  they own all of them so yeah they faked they faked a pandemic
[1:24:17.680 --> 1:24:24.720]  china stayed open and then china increased its gdp china increased its
[1:24:24.720 --> 1:24:28.160]  output china increased its its number of millionaires and
[1:24:28.160 --> 1:24:32.880]  billionaires while we the american people suffered
[1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:36.160]  the massive losses during the fake pandemic and now
[1:24:36.160 --> 1:24:39.440]  the people in our country are so brainwashed they love it
[1:24:39.440 --> 1:24:43.360]  the liberals still still wear two three masks they harass you if you don't
[1:24:43.360 --> 1:24:46.400]  wear a mask they love the lockdown they don't want businesses back open they
[1:24:46.400 --> 1:24:50.000]  don't want schools back open why don't they just go live in a cave

[1:25:49.680 --> 1:25:57.760]  humanity has been domesticated by and large the population has been trained
[1:25:57.760 --> 1:26:01.920]  to submit do what you're told that's all going to pass but if you study
[1:26:01.920 --> 1:26:04.560]  authoritarians if you study the globalists you understand that they
[1:26:04.560 --> 1:26:08.160]  reach a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of
[1:26:08.160 --> 1:26:11.760]  being called being totally enslaved and because the globalists see us as weak
[1:26:11.760 --> 1:26:14.480]  and see us as stupid they are now making that move
[1:26:14.480 --> 1:26:18.160]  and they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then
[1:26:18.160 --> 1:26:22.240]  flood us with the third world that the un will use as a weapon
[1:26:22.240 --> 1:26:25.440]  to then have us under such a crises under such a load
[1:26:25.440 --> 1:26:28.960]  capitulate to the un whatever agreements they want us to sign
[1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:32.720]  hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees
[1:26:32.720 --> 1:26:37.840]  not fleeing covid or climate change as the un and claus swab was saying and
[1:26:37.840 --> 1:26:40.640]  bill gates is saying but fleeing the year-long
[1:26:40.640 --> 1:26:45.040]  lockdowns that the un and bill gates ordered them to institute
[1:26:45.040 --> 1:26:48.480]  or they wouldn't get more imf and world bank money
[1:26:48.480 --> 1:26:53.280]  and that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists
[1:26:53.280 --> 1:26:57.520]  as men age they often experience a slowdown

[1:30:19.120 --> 1:30:22.480]  daily basis isn't it amazing and they have built a wall
[1:30:22.480 --> 1:30:26.400]  around congress to ensure that their treason can go
[1:30:26.400 --> 1:30:29.920]  guarded and protected by the united states military

[1:30:54.160 --> 1:30:59.040]  it's really sad it's really sad so let me build up with this stack of news here
[1:30:59.040 --> 1:31:01.760]  to get to this point
[1:31:01.760 --> 1:31:08.480]  this is how things work this is how things work in the biden administration
[1:31:08.480 --> 1:31:16.800]  so you just had 24 individuals charged in a voter fraud probe
[1:31:16.800 --> 1:31:25.600]  in north carolina wow 24 people charged over voter fraud in north carolina
[1:31:25.600 --> 1:31:30.800]  so that just came down the pipeline but
[1:31:30.800 --> 1:31:38.720]  the judge the federal prosecutor excuse me
[1:31:38.720 --> 1:31:42.400]  robert higdon that was appointed by trump
[1:31:42.400 --> 1:31:48.000]  after he got the 24 charges of voter fraud in north carolina
[1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:52.000]  joe biden called and requested that he would resign
[1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:56.880]  isn't that something you do your job you do it well joe biden gives you a phone
[1:31:56.880 --> 1:32:01.120]  call not to congratulate you but to lay off
[1:32:01.120 --> 1:32:06.880]  imagine that so robert higdon finds 24 counts of voter fraud in north
[1:32:06.880 --> 1:32:10.320]  carolina gets the evidence gets the charges
[1:32:10.320 --> 1:32:14.560]  next day biden calls and says please you're fired
[1:32:14.560 --> 1:32:21.440]  wow who's trying to cover up voter fraud i wonder
[1:32:21.440 --> 1:32:26.480]  oh boy now here's the democrat control of our
[1:32:26.480 --> 1:32:31.120]  apparatus rearing its ugly head california bill
[1:32:31.120 --> 1:32:36.320]  would ban members of hate groups we all know what that means right
[1:32:36.320 --> 1:32:40.400]  whitey trump supporter anything pro patriotic
[1:32:40.400 --> 1:32:44.160]  pro second amendment that's now considered a hate group
[1:32:44.160 --> 1:32:46.960]  otherwise they would have introduced a bill like this long ago if it was about
[1:32:46.960 --> 1:32:50.640]  actual hate groups but no you just assume if you're in a hate group you're not
[1:32:50.640 --> 1:32:54.880]  getting hired anyway that's called the united states of america's free market
[1:32:54.880 --> 1:32:58.720]  but the left doesn't like to promote that so they want total control of it
[1:32:58.720 --> 1:33:01.680]  and so now they're saying
[1:33:02.080 --> 1:33:06.400]  that if you are in a hate group you cannot join the california police force
[1:33:06.400 --> 1:33:09.040]  so what does that really mean again if you're a trump supporter if you're a
[1:33:09.040 --> 1:33:13.840]  patriot your pro second amendment if you listen to info wars
[1:33:13.840 --> 1:33:18.160]  you're no longer allowed to be a cop and of course they know that that will
[1:33:18.160 --> 1:33:23.040]  pretty much bring the police force down to nothing most cops are patriots
[1:33:23.040 --> 1:33:27.200]  second amendment activists so it's all by design to destroy the police force
[1:33:27.200 --> 1:33:30.640]  california is going to be the worst they're going to be hit by it the first
[1:33:30.640 --> 1:33:34.880]  so expect crime in california to continue to skyrocket
[1:33:34.880 --> 1:33:38.240]  and expect california to continue to turn into a third world
[1:33:38.240 --> 1:33:42.560]  hellhole as the california police is going to be dissolved
[1:33:42.560 --> 1:33:48.160]  from within and now externally anybody who wants to join it if you've ever
[1:33:48.160 --> 1:33:52.160]  watched an info wars broadcast or you know been in a pro pro second amendment
[1:33:52.160 --> 1:33:55.360]  group or anything like that or voted for trump they won't let you become a
[1:33:55.360 --> 1:33:58.880]  police officer now not just happening though
[1:33:58.880 --> 1:34:05.680]  inside the police force but also happening inside the military remember
[1:34:05.680 --> 1:34:09.520]  the democrats were doing interviews with all the border patrol
[1:34:09.520 --> 1:34:12.880]  in dc to make sure they didn't vote for trump and then if they found out they
[1:34:12.880 --> 1:34:15.680]  were trump supporters they'd be kicked out
[1:34:15.680 --> 1:34:21.200]  oh well maybe not yet that's coming and now the pentagon
[1:34:21.200 --> 1:34:25.520]  is going to be doing extremism training
[1:34:25.520 --> 1:34:29.920]  for troops who see capital riot and blm protests
[1:34:29.920 --> 1:34:35.760]  as similar so the the democrat party and the left wing have now completely
[1:34:35.760 --> 1:34:39.840]  politicized our military the united states military is no
[1:34:39.840 --> 1:34:45.040]  longer the united states military it's now a left wing activist group
[1:34:45.040 --> 1:34:47.600]  so look at everything that the left wing and the democrats have taken over
[1:34:47.600 --> 1:34:51.920]  hollywood it's no longer about movies it's no longer about entertainment it's
[1:34:51.920 --> 1:34:56.640]  about left-wing democrat propaganda look at the news it's no longer about
[1:34:56.640 --> 1:34:59.840]  truth it's no longer about actual news it's left-wing
[1:34:59.840 --> 1:35:04.160]  democrat propaganda look at our sports leagues no longer about sport
[1:35:04.160 --> 1:35:08.240]  no longer about fun it's all left-wing democrat propaganda
[1:35:08.240 --> 1:35:12.720]  and so now it's the police force now it's the military
[1:35:12.720 --> 1:35:16.720]  The Democrat Party are totalitarians.
[1:35:16.720 --> 1:35:17.920]  So what does that mean?
[1:35:17.920 --> 1:35:22.080]  That means they want, and if not stopped,
[1:35:22.080 --> 1:35:26.480]  will get control of everything.
[1:35:26.480 --> 1:35:27.600]  They get control of the border.
[1:35:27.600 --> 1:35:28.320]  Look at what happens.
[1:35:28.320 --> 1:35:29.600]  The border disappears.
[1:35:29.600 --> 1:35:31.920]  So even the border has been politicized.
[1:35:31.920 --> 1:35:33.920]  They politicize everything.
[1:35:33.920 --> 1:35:37.920]  These are sick, demented people that we're dealing with.
[1:35:37.920 --> 1:35:41.600]  And they are the biggest threat in the world right now.
[1:35:41.600 --> 1:35:47.840]  Leftism, leftist authoritarianism, leftist globalism,
[1:35:47.840 --> 1:35:51.760]  leftist global tyranny.
[1:35:51.760 --> 1:35:54.800]  And of course, there's the elite at the top of all this,
[1:35:54.800 --> 1:35:57.200]  running the stage, the separate societies with the Bill Gates
[1:35:57.200 --> 1:36:00.720]  and the Klaus Schwabs and all of it.
[1:36:00.720 --> 1:36:02.880]  But the only reason they're able to be successful
[1:36:02.880 --> 1:36:05.280]  is because they're able to brainwash and control
[1:36:05.280 --> 1:36:07.680]  and manipulate the left wing in this country
[1:36:07.680 --> 1:36:13.280]  that's allied and merged with them.
[1:36:13.280 --> 1:36:15.120]  So yeah, the biggest threat to humanity
[1:36:15.120 --> 1:36:17.280]  is not man-made climate change.
[1:36:17.280 --> 1:36:18.480]  It's not Donald Trump.
[1:36:18.480 --> 1:36:19.680]  It's not all the stuff they tell you.
[1:36:19.680 --> 1:36:23.120]  It's left wing totalitarianism.
[1:36:23.120 --> 1:36:24.800]  That's the biggest threat to humanity.
[1:36:24.800 --> 1:36:26.160]  That's the biggest threat to planet Earth.
[1:36:26.160 --> 1:36:27.440]  That's the biggest threat to freedom.
[1:36:27.440 --> 1:36:31.520]  But they don't value freedom, so they don't really care.
[1:36:31.520 --> 1:36:34.080]  So now they're in control of the police force,
[1:36:34.080 --> 1:36:36.880]  and they'll make sure it's only left wing radicals
[1:36:36.880 --> 1:36:39.040]  or criminals that get in there that they can control,
[1:36:39.040 --> 1:36:42.480]  and they'll do the same thing with the military now.
[1:36:42.480 --> 1:36:46.080]  And the saddest part of all of this, folks,
[1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:48.400]  and Cassandra Fairbanks is working on a story.
[1:36:48.400 --> 1:36:50.160]  She says this,
[1:36:50.160 --> 1:36:52.400]  I'm getting so many emails from veterans
[1:36:52.400 --> 1:36:54.160]  who were arrested at the Capitol.
[1:36:54.160 --> 1:36:56.720]  The government is basically using their service
[1:36:56.720 --> 1:36:59.680]  as a point in the prosecution against them.
[1:36:59.680 --> 1:37:01.760]  Yet Antifa and BLM can terrorize cities
[1:37:01.760 --> 1:37:04.480]  and be released without bail.
[1:37:04.480 --> 1:37:05.680]  She's responding to all,
[1:37:05.680 --> 1:37:09.920]  and she's gonna try to write a story about each individual
[1:37:09.920 --> 1:37:12.880]  and publish that at the Gateway Pundit.
[1:37:12.880 --> 1:37:14.320]  So I've been talking about this.
[1:37:14.320 --> 1:37:16.560]  I'm glad Cassandra Fairbanks is finally picking up the ball
[1:37:16.560 --> 1:37:18.080]  and rolling with it.
[1:37:18.080 --> 1:37:20.320]  Folks, the Democrat Party already has concentration camps.
[1:37:20.320 --> 1:37:22.080]  The Democrat Party already has detention centers.
[1:37:22.080 --> 1:37:24.320]  The Democrat Party already has the do-logs.
[1:37:24.320 --> 1:37:28.080]  There are dozens, if not hundreds, of Trump supporters
[1:37:28.080 --> 1:37:30.080]  that are rotting in jails right now.
[1:37:30.080 --> 1:37:32.640]  Dozens, if not hundreds, of military veterans
[1:37:32.640 --> 1:37:34.080]  that are rotting in jail right now.
[1:37:34.080 --> 1:37:37.280]  Now remember, why do the Democrats hate the military?
[1:37:37.280 --> 1:37:40.240]  Because the military pledged to fight
[1:37:40.240 --> 1:37:41.600]  all enemies foreign and domestic.
[1:37:41.600 --> 1:37:42.400]  Well, what does that mean?
[1:37:42.400 --> 1:37:44.400]  The Democrat Party is the domestic enemy.
[1:37:44.400 --> 1:37:46.080]  So they have to throw the veterans in jail
[1:37:46.080 --> 1:37:47.920]  because they know they're the enemy
[1:37:47.920 --> 1:37:49.920]  that the military swore to fight against.
[1:37:51.360 --> 1:37:53.760]  Alex Jones here with a new info or sale,
[1:37:53.760 --> 1:37:55.520]  and it is a fantastic sale.

[1:38:35.600 --> 1:38:37.360]  The entire immigrants essentials line

[1:38:53.600 --> 1:38:55.280]  this could be our last broadcast.
[1:38:55.280 --> 1:38:56.800]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years
[1:38:56.800 --> 1:38:59.040]  and only the last year or so have I said that.
[1:38:59.040 --> 1:39:00.640]  But let me tell you, the New World Order
[1:39:00.640 --> 1:39:02.320]  is breathing down our neck.
[1:39:02.320 --> 1:39:04.640]  The big globalist publications are coming after us
[1:39:04.640 --> 1:39:06.720]  and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[1:39:06.720 --> 1:39:09.520]  So please pray to keep info wars on the air
[1:39:09.520 --> 1:39:10.960]  and please support the local states
[1:39:10.960 --> 1:39:12.400]  you're listening to as well.

[1:39:20.080 --> 1:39:23.120]  because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[1:39:23.120 --> 1:39:24.560]  in the face of this thing.
[1:39:24.560 --> 1:39:26.720]  I need your help more than ever now.
[1:39:26.720 --> 1:39:28.240]  I want to keep fighting the globalists,
[1:39:28.240 --> 1:39:30.960]  but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[1:39:30.960 --> 1:39:33.440]  So pray for us, word of mouth,
[1:39:33.440 --> 1:39:35.680]  tell folks about the broadcast however you can,

[1:39:58.720 --> 1:40:00.000]  that we know you're gonna love,
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:01.520]  especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[1:40:01.520 --> 1:40:02.640]  It is down and out.
[1:40:02.640 --> 1:40:04.480]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[1:40:04.480 --> 1:40:07.440]  We mean down your bed sleeping hard throughout the night.
[1:40:07.440 --> 1:40:10.480]  It's got four milligrams of high quality melatonin.

[1:40:18.880 --> 1:40:21.760]  and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[1:40:21.760 --> 1:40:24.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[1:40:24.320 --> 1:40:27.360]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[1:40:27.360 --> 1:40:29.760]  It's liquid, so it goes right to your body fast.
[1:40:29.760 --> 1:40:31.680]  If you take it sublingually under the tongue,
[1:40:31.680 --> 1:40:33.520]  oh, how about blasting off to sleep?
[1:40:33.520 --> 1:40:34.240]  It's incredible.
[1:40:34.240 --> 1:40:36.800]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[1:40:36.800 --> 1:40:39.200]  It's so popular we can't keep it in stock.

[1:40:48.800 --> 1:40:52.240]  I actually bought this at Blocks UHS Frequency.
[1:40:52.240 --> 1:40:55.200]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones
[1:40:55.200 --> 1:40:57.360]  are constantly spying on us,
[1:40:57.360 --> 1:41:00.960]  not just tracking and recording our GPS location,
[1:41:00.960 --> 1:41:04.080]  but recording audio and video as well,
[1:41:04.080 --> 1:41:06.240]  with or without a battery.
[1:41:06.240 --> 1:41:09.440]  Now, with the infowars privacy pouch,

[1:41:12.320 --> 1:41:13.440]  Excellent.
[1:41:13.440 --> 1:41:15.520]  Now I have my own battery.
[1:41:15.520 --> 1:41:21.040]  You choose. Excellent. Now I have my own compact Faraday cage.
[1:41:21.040 --> 1:41:23.200]  I can take wherever I want.
[1:41:23.200 --> 1:41:27.120]  And you can too at infowarsstore.com.

[1:41:41.840 --> 1:41:42.640]  and go dark.
[1:41:42.640 --> 1:41:51.360]  Look, support the infowar and get your infowars privacy pouch today, infowarsstore.com.
[1:41:51.360 --> 1:42:16.880]  We are dealing with a Democrat mainstream media insurrection
[1:42:16.880 --> 1:42:19.040]  against the United States of America.
[1:42:19.040 --> 1:42:21.600]  In my view, it's open treason against this country.
[1:42:23.440 --> 1:42:26.080]  And so that's why they have their walls around the Capitol.
[1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:28.640]  That's why they have their censorship of the media.
[1:42:29.760 --> 1:42:33.600]  And that's why Joe Biden is hiding and won't do a press conference.
[1:42:34.800 --> 1:42:37.840]  Because everybody knows Trump won in a record landslide
[1:42:37.840 --> 1:42:38.800]  and they stole it from him.
[1:42:39.440 --> 1:42:43.120]  Everybody knows that Biden couldn't fill a high school gymnasium.
[1:42:43.120 --> 1:42:44.960]  He couldn't even fill a high school locker,
[1:42:44.960 --> 1:42:45.920]  let alone a locker room.
[1:42:45.920 --> 1:42:46.960]  He couldn't even fill a locker.
[1:42:46.960 --> 1:42:49.920]  Everybody knows they've opened the border wide open.
[1:42:49.920 --> 1:42:50.800]  It's total sedition.
[1:42:50.800 --> 1:42:51.600]  It's total treason.
[1:42:51.600 --> 1:42:54.240]  Everybody knows that Biden shut down our energy.
[1:42:54.240 --> 1:42:56.480]  Everybody knows gas prices are skyrocketing.
[1:42:56.480 --> 1:42:59.360]  Everybody knows that violent crime is skyrocketing.
[1:42:59.360 --> 1:43:03.520]  And if the media wasn't there protecting the Democrat Party in Biden,
[1:43:04.640 --> 1:43:07.520]  everybody would know it's the Democrat Party in Biden responsible.
[1:43:07.520 --> 1:43:09.280]  And of course, this is just common sense.
[1:43:09.280 --> 1:43:11.120]  You look at any major city in America
[1:43:11.120 --> 1:43:13.280]  that's been run by Democrats for 50 years,
[1:43:13.280 --> 1:43:17.280]  it's the highest crime rate in the country.
[1:43:18.320 --> 1:43:20.240]  And it's not even close.
[1:43:20.240 --> 1:43:23.600]  It's also got the highest rates of poverty in the country.
[1:43:23.600 --> 1:43:27.600]  So imagine Democrats take control of the major cities 50 years ago
[1:43:27.600 --> 1:43:31.280]  and drive every single one of them into poverty and violent crime.
[1:43:32.320 --> 1:43:35.040]  And they still vote Democrat or do they?
[1:43:37.040 --> 1:43:40.160]  I'm not so sure we've had any real elections in this country
[1:43:40.160 --> 1:43:43.280]  for a long time, at least not in mass.
[1:43:44.880 --> 1:43:48.480]  So this is the issue at hand.
[1:43:50.720 --> 1:43:54.320]  And I just hope that America can have a great awakening
[1:43:54.960 --> 1:43:58.320]  in response to all of this within enough time
[1:43:58.320 --> 1:44:00.560]  that we can salvage what we have left here in America
[1:44:02.240 --> 1:44:05.760]  and build another prosperous civilization
[1:44:05.760 --> 1:44:12.080]  into, through the 20th century and beyond.
[1:44:13.920 --> 1:44:18.000]  But at this rate, with the current system of control
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:21.680]  and the Democrats going full authoritarianism and totalitarian,
[1:44:23.120 --> 1:44:24.080]  it's not looking good.
[1:44:24.080 --> 1:44:26.000]  They will dissolve the United States of America
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:27.120]  into a one world government.
[1:44:27.840 --> 1:44:30.080]  And all the things that we've taken for granted,
[1:44:30.080 --> 1:44:37.200]  private property, ease of access, options for food
[1:44:37.200 --> 1:44:39.600]  and groceries and everything else in between in schools,
[1:44:39.600 --> 1:44:43.920]  all of it will be gone, gone.
[1:44:45.680 --> 1:44:46.560]  And I mean, I get it.
[1:44:46.560 --> 1:44:49.040]  I get why the average person on Fox News
[1:44:49.040 --> 1:44:51.680]  that has a million dollar salary doesn't get freaked out by this.
[1:44:51.680 --> 1:44:52.640]  Of course they're not.
[1:44:52.640 --> 1:44:53.920]  They got everything they need.
[1:44:53.920 --> 1:44:55.840]  They're living in the lap of luxury.
[1:44:55.840 --> 1:44:57.600]  They're kicking it at the country club.
[1:44:57.600 --> 1:45:03.440]  It's all good, baby. No, this is serious stuff.
[1:45:05.200 --> 1:45:09.440]  And I have a feeling that for the first time
[1:45:09.440 --> 1:45:11.680]  since Biden has been in office,
[1:45:11.680 --> 1:45:13.840]  that the long knives are now out for him.
[1:45:13.840 --> 1:45:18.240]  And there is an active agenda to remove him.
[1:45:18.880 --> 1:45:22.480]  And the reason I'm saying this is because last night,
[1:45:22.480 --> 1:45:26.480]  I saw more anti-Biden headlines
[1:45:26.480 --> 1:45:28.800]  and pro Kamala Harris headlines than I've ever seen.
[1:45:29.680 --> 1:45:32.720]  So that usually means there's a plan afoot.
[1:45:32.720 --> 1:45:35.040]  When you understand how the media
[1:45:35.040 --> 1:45:37.920]  and the Democrat Party operates in their collusion
[1:45:39.040 --> 1:45:43.840]  and in their agendas, here's a couple examples from Slate.com.
[1:45:44.480 --> 1:45:47.840]  Joe Biden wiped out big time on the Air Force One Stairs
[1:45:47.840 --> 1:45:49.520]  and then they talk about how he can't walk.
[1:45:49.520 --> 1:45:50.880]  He's not having press conferences.
[1:45:50.880 --> 1:45:52.880]  What is going on? Uh-oh.
[1:45:53.840 --> 1:45:56.480]  Of course, you have Biden saying President Harris.
[1:45:56.480 --> 1:45:57.840]  How many times has he said that now?
[1:45:57.840 --> 1:45:59.680]  Ten times, he says President Harris.
[1:45:59.680 --> 1:46:00.880]  You had Biden the other day saying
[1:46:00.880 --> 1:46:02.400]  that Harris was smarter than him.
[1:46:02.400 --> 1:46:03.440]  Well, then why did you run?
[1:46:03.440 --> 1:46:05.600]  Why did you even run, Joe, if Harris is so great?
[1:46:06.320 --> 1:46:08.480]  By the way, Harris didn't receive a single vote.
[1:46:08.480 --> 1:46:09.520]  She dropped out of the race.
[1:46:09.520 --> 1:46:10.960]  She was the least popular candidate.
[1:46:11.840 --> 1:46:13.920]  She also said that she believed the accusers
[1:46:13.920 --> 1:46:17.040]  against Joe Biden of the sexual assault and harassment.
[1:46:17.040 --> 1:46:18.480]  So it's funny how that's all changed.
[1:46:18.480 --> 1:46:20.480]  But Biden, why did you even run?
[1:46:20.480 --> 1:46:23.280]  If you're so weak and you can't handle a press conference
[1:46:23.280 --> 1:46:24.880]  and you can't handle the crises
[1:46:24.880 --> 1:46:26.880]  and you think Harris is smarter,
[1:46:26.880 --> 1:46:28.480]  then why did you even run, Joe?
[1:46:30.480 --> 1:46:32.480]  They're getting ready to wipe them out, folks.
[1:46:33.680 --> 1:46:35.680]  Washington Times, President in waiting.
[1:46:35.680 --> 1:46:39.680]  Harris seizes spotlight with Biden's future uncertain.
[1:46:39.680 --> 1:46:45.920]  Oh. Oh, now, I don't think Harris has ever seized anything
[1:46:45.920 --> 1:46:48.720]  except for maybe Willie Brown's jock.
[1:46:50.720 --> 1:46:53.120]  But, boy, oh, boy, you know, I'll be honest.
[1:46:54.320 --> 1:46:55.520]  Dealing with Biden is one thing.
[1:46:55.520 --> 1:46:56.720]  I never really have to deal with him.
[1:46:57.520 --> 1:47:00.320]  If they put Harris in and she'll probably be accompanied
[1:47:00.320 --> 1:47:05.920]  by Pelosi, I mean, the disaster that that's going to be
[1:47:05.920 --> 1:47:08.720]  is just unforeseeable, quite frankly.
[1:47:08.720 --> 1:47:10.320]  I really don't even know.
[1:47:12.320 --> 1:47:14.320]  Because it's going to turn into a tea party with them,
[1:47:14.320 --> 1:47:18.320]  like little girls playing a picnic in the summer at a park.
[1:47:19.520 --> 1:47:20.720]  And it'll be all fun and games.
[1:47:20.720 --> 1:47:21.920]  And they'll destroy this country.
[1:47:21.920 --> 1:47:24.320]  They'll destroy millions of Americans' lives.
[1:47:24.320 --> 1:47:26.720]  They'll completely wreck everything.
[1:47:26.720 --> 1:47:29.120]  And they'll just laugh about it and gladden themselves.
[1:47:29.120 --> 1:47:30.720]  We're women. We're in charge.
[1:47:30.720 --> 1:47:32.320]  We're running the show. Yay!
[1:47:32.320 --> 1:47:34.320]  And the whole world will go to hell.
[1:47:34.320 --> 1:47:36.720]  And war will break out around the world.
[1:47:36.720 --> 1:47:38.720]  And Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi
[1:47:38.720 --> 1:47:40.320]  were up there clinking glasses saying,
[1:47:40.320 --> 1:47:44.320]  we did it for women. Yay!
[1:47:44.320 --> 1:47:48.320]  Joe Biden says, at some point he will visit the border
[1:47:48.320 --> 1:47:52.320]  at some point, guys, at some point.
[1:47:52.320 --> 1:47:54.320]  We don't know when because, well, Joe doesn't know when
[1:47:54.320 --> 1:47:56.320]  because he's told what to do and when to do it.
[1:47:56.320 --> 1:48:00.320]  But at some point the double mask wearing can't walk
[1:48:00.320 --> 1:48:04.320]  or talk freak says at some point he'll visit the border.
[1:48:04.320 --> 1:48:08.320]  Boy, now we know why they had to get Warnock in there so bad.
[1:48:08.320 --> 1:48:10.320]  Probably a lot of blackmail on this guy.
[1:48:10.320 --> 1:48:12.320]  A lot of blackmail on this guy.
[1:48:12.320 --> 1:48:14.320]  Think about just what we know about him
[1:48:14.320 --> 1:48:18.320]  and the abuse he covered up at the church in Georgia.
[1:48:18.320 --> 1:48:24.320]  When he ran over his wife during a domestic dispute,
[1:48:24.320 --> 1:48:25.320]  that's just what we know about him.
[1:48:25.320 --> 1:48:27.320]  Imagine what we don't know about this guy.
[1:48:27.320 --> 1:48:29.320]  But the Democrats had to steal that election in Georgia
[1:48:29.320 --> 1:48:30.320]  to get him in.
[1:48:30.320 --> 1:48:32.320]  Well, here's what he's up to.
[1:48:32.320 --> 1:48:35.320]  He's pushing for voting rights.
[1:48:35.320 --> 1:48:37.320]  Of course, we all know what that means.
[1:48:37.320 --> 1:48:40.320]  Giving Democrats ease of access to cheating
[1:48:40.320 --> 1:48:42.320]  and legalizing their big cheat.
[1:48:42.320 --> 1:48:44.320]  So that's what that's really about.
[1:48:44.320 --> 1:48:46.320]  Everybody already has voting rights.
[1:48:46.320 --> 1:48:48.320]  If you ask the Democrat what voting rights do we need,
[1:48:48.320 --> 1:48:49.320]  they couldn't tell you.
[1:48:49.320 --> 1:48:50.320]  Everybody's already got it.
[1:48:50.320 --> 1:48:52.320]  So that's the big lie.
[1:48:52.320 --> 1:48:56.320]  Warnock says reasonable gun reform is a necessity
[1:48:56.320 --> 1:48:58.320]  because of the Atlanta shootings.
[1:48:58.320 --> 1:48:59.320]  There it is.
[1:48:59.320 --> 1:49:00.320]  There it is.
[1:49:00.320 --> 1:49:01.320]  We were waiting for it.
[1:49:01.320 --> 1:49:02.320]  We weren't sure when it was going to come.
[1:49:02.320 --> 1:49:03.320]  But there it is.
[1:49:03.320 --> 1:49:05.320]  Blame the gun.
[1:49:05.320 --> 1:49:08.320]  Blame the gun as usual.
[1:49:08.320 --> 1:49:11.320]  It doesn't matter that there's cities in Georgia
[1:49:11.320 --> 1:49:15.320]  that have the highest percentage of gun ownership in America,
[1:49:15.320 --> 1:49:18.320]  and they have the lowest percentage in violent crime.
[1:49:18.320 --> 1:49:22.320]  But I wouldn't expect the Georgia senator to know that.
[1:49:22.320 --> 1:49:24.320]  Why would I expect him to know anything about his own state?
[1:49:24.320 --> 1:49:26.320]  After all, he's a Democrat.
[1:49:26.320 --> 1:49:31.320]  All he knows is the agenda that he's told to promote
[1:49:31.320 --> 1:49:35.320]  and the words that he's told to say.
[1:49:35.320 --> 1:49:37.320]  So that's what the Democrats are up to.
[1:49:37.320 --> 1:49:38.320]  Isn't it fun?
[1:49:38.320 --> 1:49:40.320]  The Democrats are politicizing our military.
[1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:42.320]  The Democrats are politicizing our police.
[1:49:42.320 --> 1:49:44.320]  The Democrats are coming for our second amendment.
[1:49:44.320 --> 1:49:45.320]  They're coming for our first amendment.
[1:49:45.320 --> 1:49:50.320]  They're trying to destroy fair the integrity of our elections.
[1:49:50.320 --> 1:49:52.320]  Our southern border is wide open.
[1:49:52.320 --> 1:49:53.320]  Oh, and don't forget,
[1:49:53.320 --> 1:49:58.320]  Biden is also saber rattling with China
[1:49:58.320 --> 1:50:01.320]  and with Putin and being laughed at
[1:50:01.320 --> 1:50:04.320]  because he's the most corrupt president we've ever had.
[1:50:04.320 --> 1:50:06.320]  China owns him.
[1:50:06.320 --> 1:50:08.320]  And so when Blinken shows up with the Chinese delegation,
[1:50:08.320 --> 1:50:10.320]  they laugh in his face saying,
[1:50:10.320 --> 1:50:11.320]  you don't have any standing here.
[1:50:11.320 --> 1:50:12.320]  We own your ass.
[1:50:12.320 --> 1:50:13.320]  You're corrupt.
[1:50:13.320 --> 1:50:14.320]  Your president's corrupt.
[1:50:14.320 --> 1:50:15.320]  Your media's corrupt.
[1:50:15.320 --> 1:50:16.320]  We own all of you.
[1:50:16.320 --> 1:50:18.320]  Don't sit here and try to lecture me.
[1:50:18.320 --> 1:50:19.320]  You fool.
[1:50:19.320 --> 1:50:22.320]  And the amazing thing is, I mean, look, to China's,
[1:50:22.320 --> 1:50:23.320]  I mean, you got to be honest.
[1:50:23.320 --> 1:50:24.320]  I mean, China, obviously,
[1:50:24.320 --> 1:50:25.320]  I'm no fan of the Communist Party,
[1:50:25.320 --> 1:50:27.320]  but like they're being honest about the situation.
[1:50:27.320 --> 1:50:29.320]  They're telling the world, we own Biden.
[1:50:29.320 --> 1:50:31.320]  We own the United States of America.
[1:50:31.320 --> 1:50:33.320]  You will be destabilized.
[1:50:33.320 --> 1:50:38.320]  It will be the Chinese 21st century and we're going for world power.
[1:50:38.320 --> 1:50:39.320]  They're bragging about it.
[1:50:39.320 --> 1:50:41.320]  They're set up to do it.
[1:50:41.320 --> 1:50:43.320]  They've put in the proper measures.
[1:50:43.320 --> 1:50:47.320]  China can go for world domination in the next 10 years,
[1:50:47.320 --> 1:50:52.320]  and it will all be thanks to Biden opening the doors in the West.
[1:50:52.320 --> 1:50:55.320]  But here's some of the other developing news there.
[1:50:55.320 --> 1:51:00.320]  Iran threatens U.S. Army post and top general.
[1:51:00.320 --> 1:51:04.320]  So again, Biden talking trash on Iran.
[1:51:04.320 --> 1:51:07.320]  But see, here's the thing with Trump,
[1:51:07.320 --> 1:51:10.320]  it was measured and he was actually communicating with these people.
[1:51:10.320 --> 1:51:13.320]  With Biden, he's not talking to them.
[1:51:13.320 --> 1:51:16.320]  Harris is talking to them and Biden is unstable and they all know it.
[1:51:16.320 --> 1:51:18.320]  So it's really just rude and disrespectful for Biden
[1:51:18.320 --> 1:51:21.320]  to be saying anything in public about any of this.
[1:51:21.320 --> 1:51:25.320]  Because Harris handles his international diplomatic phone calls
[1:51:25.320 --> 1:51:28.320]  and Biden can't even remember what he ate for breakfast.
[1:51:28.320 --> 1:51:30.320]  And the whole world knows it.
[1:51:30.320 --> 1:51:36.320]  Japan and U.S. defense chiefs affirm cooperation over Taiwan emergency.
[1:51:36.320 --> 1:51:40.320]  Japan may deploy military to protect U.S. from China.
[1:51:40.320 --> 1:51:42.320]  Tokyo warns of Taiwan tension,
[1:51:42.320 --> 1:51:46.320]  seeks to deploy military overseas for the first time since 1945.
[1:51:46.320 --> 1:51:47.320]  Wow, boy.
[1:51:47.320 --> 1:51:51.320]  The war kits, the war drums, the war constellations
[1:51:51.320 --> 1:51:54.320]  are all coming into focus now, aren't they?
[1:51:54.320 --> 1:51:57.320]  Didn't take long, did it?
[1:51:57.320 --> 1:51:59.320]  Didn't take long, didn't it?
[1:51:59.320 --> 1:52:01.320]  Hey, say what you want about Trump.
[1:52:01.320 --> 1:52:02.320]  He didn't start these wars.
[1:52:02.320 --> 1:52:04.320]  He wasn't about the military-industrial complex.
[1:52:04.320 --> 1:52:06.320]  He wanted to end them.
[1:52:06.320 --> 1:52:09.320]  And he got sabotaged by the Pentagon many times, actually.
[1:52:09.320 --> 1:52:11.320]  He's learning about it now.
[1:52:11.320 --> 1:52:13.320]  So yeah, the New World Order wants a bunch of war.
[1:52:13.320 --> 1:52:17.320]  They need to kill about 50, 100 million people in a World War III scenario
[1:52:17.320 --> 1:52:21.320]  and then bring in the world government to save us from war.
[1:52:21.320 --> 1:52:23.320]  But hey, don't worry, guys.
[1:52:23.320 --> 1:52:27.320]  Buckingham Palace is considering a diversity czar
[1:52:27.320 --> 1:52:29.320]  in wake of the Meghan Markle interview.
[1:52:29.320 --> 1:52:35.320]  So an entitled briefcase model is bringing down the royal crown.
[1:52:35.320 --> 1:52:37.320]  I'm not even complaining.
[1:52:37.320 --> 1:52:39.320]  This one is a show.
[1:52:39.320 --> 1:52:49.320]  Gimrex Essentials is all-natural, all-organic, high-end, quality, clean, self-care products.

[1:53:42.320 --> 1:53:47.320]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[1:53:51.320 --> 1:53:54.320]  Even before I had access to these shows in the mid-1990s,
[1:53:54.320 --> 1:53:57.320]  I went and saw that movie and thought, man, that was fun.
[1:53:57.320 --> 1:54:00.320]  In fact, you speak out and have your own ideas,
[1:54:00.320 --> 1:54:03.320]  and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining because you're real.
[1:54:03.320 --> 1:54:05.320]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[1:54:05.320 --> 1:54:09.320]  We're not worthy. We're not worthy.
[1:54:09.320 --> 1:54:13.320]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you
[1:54:13.320 --> 1:54:15.320]  because these topics are so huge or so real.
[1:54:15.320 --> 1:54:18.320]  But I'm trying to tell you the truth. I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do.
[1:54:18.320 --> 1:54:21.320]  The globalists love lying to you. They love manipulating you.
[1:54:21.320 --> 1:54:24.320]  They enjoy destroying humanity.
[1:54:24.320 --> 1:54:28.320]  They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[1:54:28.320 --> 1:54:32.320]  That, for me, is really such a disgusting thing.
[1:54:32.320 --> 1:54:35.320]  You've got to pledge for myself and the All Info Wars crew
[1:54:35.320 --> 1:54:38.320]  that we will never join the globalists.
[1:54:38.320 --> 1:55:03.320]  We will never know how we manipulate you because we know we're all in this together.
[1:55:03.320 --> 1:55:12.320]  But seriously, an entitled briefcase model, Meghan Markle, may bring down the royal crown.
[1:55:12.320 --> 1:55:16.320]  I'm not even complaining. I mean, this bimbo, I'm no fan of hers,
[1:55:16.320 --> 1:55:24.320]  but it's hilarious to see the royal crown squeamishly trying to figure out how to deal with her.
[1:55:24.320 --> 1:55:32.320]  It just shows how pathetic they really are, but it makes you wonder about that Prince Harry, after all.
[1:55:32.320 --> 1:55:35.320]  Doesn't it? Maybe there should be a DNA test.
[1:55:35.320 --> 1:55:41.320]  Just a thought, a DNA test for Prince Harry and his alleged father.
[1:55:41.320 --> 1:55:46.320]  Just an idea. There could be some serious stuff going on there.
[1:55:46.320 --> 1:55:51.320]  That's why it might not be making any sense on the surface level.
[1:55:51.320 --> 1:55:57.320]  Anyway, I have covered almost all of the news here that I was planning to get to,
[1:55:57.320 --> 1:56:01.320]  so I'm thinking about opening up the phone lines for the third hour, and then I'll be back.
[1:56:01.320 --> 1:56:04.320]  I do have six hours worth of news today.
[1:56:04.320 --> 1:56:07.320]  I'll be back hosting the war room from 3 to PM Central.
[1:56:07.320 --> 1:56:09.320]  That's what I normally host, but doing double duty today.
[1:56:09.320 --> 1:56:15.320]  So I've got plenty of news that I've got reserved that I'm going to cover there and other video clips.
[1:56:15.320 --> 1:56:19.320]  But I've been able to get through all my news here today for the most part.
[1:56:19.320 --> 1:56:22.320]  So I'm thinking I'm going to open up the phone lines when we come back.
[1:56:22.320 --> 1:56:35.320]  In fact, I'll get out that number now, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539 to get in on the lines today.
[1:56:35.320 --> 1:56:40.320]  And anything we've covered so far is fair game.
[1:56:40.320 --> 1:56:44.320]  Here's the other headlines I haven't gotten to yet.
[1:56:44.320 --> 1:56:47.320]  Is the fake UFO invasion inevitable?
[1:56:47.320 --> 1:56:54.320]  The U.S. has secret evidence of UFOs breaking sound barrier without a sonic boom.
[1:56:54.320 --> 1:57:05.320]  So you have all this news about aliens and the Navy talking about UFOs,
[1:57:05.320 --> 1:57:11.320]  and now Air Force talking about UFOs and commercial airline pilots talking about UFOs,
[1:57:11.320 --> 1:57:15.320]  and they're releasing all these, you know, like black box tapes and images and such.
[1:57:15.320 --> 1:57:19.320]  And now they say a UFO has broken the sound barrier without creating a sonic boom.
[1:57:19.320 --> 1:57:26.320]  So who knows what's really going on.
[1:57:26.320 --> 1:57:32.320]  But boy, oh boy, you just feel like it's all playing out part of a plan for humanity
[1:57:32.320 --> 1:57:36.320]  that's been in place for long, long periods of time.
[1:57:36.320 --> 1:57:39.320]  So when are they going to roll out the aliens?
[1:57:39.320 --> 1:57:42.320]  Looks like they're greasing the skids for that right now.
[1:57:42.320 --> 1:57:48.320]  Bernie Sanders in response to Elon Musk, so Bernie misses the mark again.
[1:57:48.320 --> 1:57:51.320]  But you know, his point is interesting here in responding to Elon Musk.
[1:57:51.320 --> 1:57:55.320]  Space travel is an exciting idea, but right now we need to focus on Earth
[1:57:55.320 --> 1:57:57.320]  and create a progressive tax system.
[1:57:57.320 --> 1:57:59.320]  Oh, there it is again, his tax system.
[1:57:59.320 --> 1:58:00.320]  Give me a break.
[1:58:00.320 --> 1:58:01.320]  Yeah, how about less taxes?
[1:58:01.320 --> 1:58:04.320]  See, here's the funny thing about liberals.
[1:58:04.320 --> 1:58:07.320]  They want more taxes so they can give you more money.
[1:58:07.320 --> 1:58:09.320]  Huh? What?
[1:58:09.320 --> 1:58:13.320]  That's literal mafia gangster.
[1:58:13.320 --> 1:58:17.320]  You know, give me your cut and then I'll give you a percentage.
[1:58:17.320 --> 1:58:23.320]  So Democrats and Bernie Sanders communists want to take your money
[1:58:23.320 --> 1:58:25.320]  so they can give you a little bit of it back.
[1:58:25.320 --> 1:58:27.320]  But that's what he's all about.
[1:58:27.320 --> 1:58:29.320]  So that children don't go hungry.
[1:58:29.320 --> 1:58:33.320]  No, the free market solves poverty, not communism that creates poverty.
[1:58:33.320 --> 1:58:36.320]  People are not homeless and all Americans have health care.
[1:58:36.320 --> 1:58:38.320]  Again, the free market solves these issues.
[1:58:38.320 --> 1:58:40.320]  We're moving communism kills these things.
[1:58:40.320 --> 1:58:44.320]  The level of inequality in America is obscene and a threat to our democracy.
[1:58:44.320 --> 1:58:47.320]  Again, all because of big government.
[1:58:47.320 --> 1:58:49.320]  Big government is killing the middle class.
[1:58:49.320 --> 1:58:51.320]  Taxes are killing the middle class.
[1:58:51.320 --> 1:58:53.320]  But this is in response to Elon Musk.
[1:58:53.320 --> 1:58:58.320]  Hey, Bernie, in case you didn't know, Elon Musk and SpaceX is in the private market.
[1:58:58.320 --> 1:59:03.320]  Now, people will argue there's been a lot of money given to Elon Musk
[1:59:03.320 --> 1:59:05.320]  from the government to run some projects.
[1:59:05.320 --> 1:59:08.320]  Why not go after NASA, Bernie Sanders?
[1:59:08.320 --> 1:59:11.320]  Don't go after SpaceX. Go after NASA.
[1:59:11.320 --> 1:59:15.320]  The claims they have a new rocket that they can put on the moon.
[1:59:15.320 --> 1:59:20.320]  I think they're just saving face because they're getting their ass kicked by Elon Musk right now.
[1:59:20.320 --> 1:59:22.320]  But CNN has a story.
[1:59:22.320 --> 1:59:25.320]  Scientists want to build a doomsday vault on the moon.
[1:59:25.320 --> 1:59:27.320]  Well, why would they want to do that?
[1:59:27.320 --> 1:59:32.320]  Because they are destroying the earth by design and the New World Order is coming.
[1:59:32.320 --> 1:59:37.320]  So they need a doomsday vault on the moon, which is going to have sperm and seeds and humanoids
[1:59:37.320 --> 1:59:38.320]  and all this stuff to save humanity.
[1:59:38.320 --> 1:59:40.320]  So they care about humanity all of a sudden.
[1:59:40.320 --> 1:59:42.320]  But they want to end the carbon life cycle.
[1:59:42.320 --> 1:59:44.320]  And by the way, here's an issue that we all face.
[1:59:44.320 --> 1:59:47.320]  And Elon Musk is the only one addressing traffic.
[1:59:47.320 --> 1:59:50.320]  What the hell, man?
[1:59:50.320 --> 1:59:54.320]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on there.
[1:59:54.320 --> 1:59:57.320]  About looking at the world from the perspective of the globalist.
[1:59:57.320 --> 2:00:02.320]  That the public's so dumbed down that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them,
[2:00:02.320 --> 2:00:06.320]  that we're poisoning them, that we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed.
[2:00:06.320 --> 2:00:08.320]  Yes, that's the position of the globalists.
[2:00:08.320 --> 2:00:09.320]  They play God.
[2:00:09.320 --> 2:00:13.320]  And they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[2:00:13.320 --> 2:00:17.320]  You know, I've told you that the globalists have tried to harm me.
[2:00:17.320 --> 2:00:18.320]  They've tried to get me to join them.
[2:00:18.320 --> 2:00:22.320]  But metaphysically at a spiritual level, I have the Holy Spirit.
[2:00:22.320 --> 2:00:24.320]  I'm the connection with God.
[2:00:24.320 --> 2:00:27.320]  And I know that God does not like that, so I cannot join the enemy.
[2:00:27.320 --> 2:00:33.320]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with the system,
[2:00:33.320 --> 2:00:36.320]  believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power on it.
[2:00:36.320 --> 2:00:40.320]  Whether you're just a steelworker or a schoolteacher or a Henry Kissinger,
[2:00:40.320 --> 2:00:42.320]  you're not God.
[2:00:42.320 --> 2:00:49.320]  And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real God of the Universe doesn't like.
[2:00:49.320 --> 2:00:59.320]  And that's a fact.
[2:00:59.320 --> 2:01:02.320]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[2:01:02.320 --> 2:01:08.320]  It is The Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[2:01:08.320 --> 2:01:13.320]  The good news is the world is awakening to the lies of the mainstream media
[2:01:13.320 --> 2:01:17.320]  and the New World Order agenda and the corruption within the Democrat Party.
[2:01:17.320 --> 2:01:19.320]  Americans are getting sick of the double standards.
[2:01:19.320 --> 2:01:21.320]  Wide open southern border.
[2:01:21.320 --> 2:01:25.320]  They get to come in without masks, infected with COVID and released from the country.
[2:01:25.320 --> 2:01:30.320]  But every American is treated like a bio weapon that needs to be mashed up, double-mashed up,
[2:01:30.320 --> 2:01:32.320]  tested every day and shut in.
[2:01:32.320 --> 2:01:34.320]  So Americans are sick of it.
[2:01:34.320 --> 2:01:36.320]  We still have a desire to be free, most of us.
[2:01:36.320 --> 2:01:38.320]  And so it will win out in the end.
[2:01:38.320 --> 2:01:41.320]  But it's going to be met with the New World Order.
[2:01:41.320 --> 2:01:49.320]  And so it's going to be a true unstoppable object meeting and immovable force.
[2:01:49.320 --> 2:01:56.320]  We're about to see what that's going to look like.
[2:01:56.320 --> 2:02:03.320]  But you have to say, I mean, from my experience, just from going about town,
[2:02:03.320 --> 2:02:08.320]  I mean, I don't know if it's Biden voter remorse because I don't think anybody voted for Biden,
[2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:10.320]  but it's Biden awareness.
[2:02:10.320 --> 2:02:12.320]  It's New World Order awareness.
[2:02:12.320 --> 2:02:14.320]  It's corruption awareness.
[2:02:14.320 --> 2:02:19.320]  And part of this is a backfire because of all the things they said about Trump.
[2:02:19.320 --> 2:02:23.320]  And they forced people, because of their attacks on Trump,
[2:02:23.320 --> 2:02:29.320]  they forced people to really pay attention to government and politics for the first time.
[2:02:29.320 --> 2:02:33.320]  And so now that Trump is out, but they see all the issues still remain,
[2:02:33.320 --> 2:02:35.320]  and they're actually worse than ever.
[2:02:35.320 --> 2:02:37.320]  And it's not really making sense in their head.
[2:02:37.320 --> 2:02:40.320]  They need a new boogeyman.
[2:02:40.320 --> 2:02:43.320]  But the boogeyman isn't there because Biden is not seen.
[2:02:43.320 --> 2:02:46.320]  And so then they just look at the overall issues and they say, huh,
[2:02:46.320 --> 2:02:48.320]  how come gas prices are going up?
[2:02:48.320 --> 2:02:51.320]  How come my energy is being shut off and prices going up?
[2:02:51.320 --> 2:02:53.320]  How come we don't have a southern border?
[2:02:53.320 --> 2:02:55.320]  How come they said stimulus money and we never got it?
[2:02:55.320 --> 2:03:00.320]  How come they passed $5 trillion stimulus in the last 12 months, but I didn't get a dime?
[2:03:00.320 --> 2:03:02.320]  What's going on here?
[2:03:02.320 --> 2:03:06.320]  That's Washington politics as usual.
[2:03:06.320 --> 2:03:08.320]  And we wish Trump would have done something more about it.
[2:03:08.320 --> 2:03:13.320]  We wish he would have really fought him in a kamikaze-style mission,
[2:03:13.320 --> 2:03:16.320]  but he bailed out at the end and he flew his jet to safety.
[2:03:16.320 --> 2:03:18.320]  And so that's fine.
[2:03:18.320 --> 2:03:20.320]  But that's where we're at.
[2:03:20.320 --> 2:03:23.320]  So the New World Order is back in command.
[2:03:23.320 --> 2:03:26.320]  And the Biden administration is committing open treason on a daily basis.
[2:03:26.320 --> 2:03:29.320]  That's not just rhetoric. That's what they're doing.
[2:03:29.320 --> 2:03:31.320]  The southern border being wide open is the perfect example.
[2:03:31.320 --> 2:03:34.320]  So but not only is it open treason at the southern border,
[2:03:34.320 --> 2:03:38.320]  it's also crimes against humanity stacking these people in like sardines.
[2:03:38.320 --> 2:03:41.320]  So first telling them to come here, they'll be taken care of,
[2:03:41.320 --> 2:03:44.320]  then stealing from us to take care of them,
[2:03:44.320 --> 2:03:52.320]  but then stuffing them like sardines into these cages all for a political agenda
[2:03:52.320 --> 2:03:54.320]  to destabilize the United States of America.
[2:03:54.320 --> 2:03:56.320]  That's a crime against humanity.
[2:03:56.320 --> 2:04:00.320]  So the Democrat Party is committing open treason, open crimes against humanity,
[2:04:00.320 --> 2:04:04.320]  and the only reason they get away with it is because the media is there to protect them.
[2:04:04.320 --> 2:04:06.320]  That's it.
[2:04:06.320 --> 2:04:08.320]  So that's what we're dealing with.
[2:04:08.320 --> 2:04:10.320]  I've opened up the phone lines.
[2:04:10.320 --> 2:04:16.320]  Anything we've covered so far today on The Alex Jones Show is fair game, 877-789-2539.
[2:04:16.320 --> 2:04:18.320]  I'll be here with you till 2 p.m.
[2:04:18.320 --> 2:04:20.320]  Guys, who's hosting the fourth hour today?
[2:04:22.320 --> 2:04:25.320]  Wonderful. Gerald Salente, always the great Gerald Salente.
[2:04:25.320 --> 2:04:27.320]  He's going to be hosting the fourth hour.
[2:04:27.320 --> 2:04:30.320]  I'll be handing him the baton at 2 in an hour.
[2:04:30.320 --> 2:04:32.320]  I'm going to take your phone calls till then,
[2:04:32.320 --> 2:04:35.320]  and then I'll be back in the driver's seat hosting the war room today.
[2:04:35.320 --> 2:04:40.320]  Believe me, I held over a lot of news today that I didn't cover here,
[2:04:40.320 --> 2:04:43.320]  that I'm going to cover in the war room, a lot of video clips as well,
[2:04:43.320 --> 2:04:45.320]  and some great guests.
[2:04:45.320 --> 2:04:47.320]  So that's all coming up.
[2:04:47.320 --> 2:04:49.320]  But I want to take your phone calls.
[2:04:49.320 --> 2:04:51.320]  Guys, you give me the phone board there.
[2:04:51.320 --> 2:04:53.320]  Real quickly, remember infowarstore.com, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:04:53.320 --> 2:04:56.320]  do not take Infowars broadcasts for granted.
[2:04:56.320 --> 2:05:00.320]  You know, I was so used to just for the last,
[2:05:00.320 --> 2:05:03.320]  I don't know how many years, getting home from work
[2:05:03.320 --> 2:05:06.320]  and immediately tuning into Rush Limbaugh.
[2:05:06.320 --> 2:05:09.320]  And so it's not that I took Rush for granted.
[2:05:09.320 --> 2:05:14.320]  He's passed on to heaven, but I miss it.
[2:05:14.320 --> 2:05:16.320]  I miss that.
[2:05:16.320 --> 2:05:20.320]  I miss having Rush Limbaugh there when I got home from work.
[2:05:20.320 --> 2:05:23.320]  But that was inevitable. Everybody dies.
[2:05:23.320 --> 2:05:27.320]  Don't let that happen to Infowars,
[2:05:27.320 --> 2:05:31.320]  where you're used to turning into Infowars first thing in the morning,
[2:05:31.320 --> 2:05:34.320]  or you're used to listening to Alex Jones' show at 11,
[2:05:34.320 --> 2:05:37.320]  or you're used to listening to the war room at 3,
[2:05:37.320 --> 2:05:40.320]  or you go back at the end of the day and go to Band.video
[2:05:40.320 --> 2:05:42.320]  and look at all the stuff we've covered.
[2:05:42.320 --> 2:05:46.320]  Don't wake up one day and have it gone.
[2:05:46.320 --> 2:05:49.320]  And it won't be because anybody or everybody here died.
[2:05:49.320 --> 2:05:52.320]  We've got a large crew.
[2:05:52.320 --> 2:05:54.320]  But it'll be because of the censorship.
[2:05:54.320 --> 2:05:57.320]  It'll be because of the attacks against us and the lies
[2:05:57.320 --> 2:05:59.320]  and everything that is going on behind the scenes.
[2:05:59.320 --> 2:06:02.320]  So your prayers always needed and appreciated.
[2:06:02.320 --> 2:06:05.320]  But remember about the financial support aspect of it
[2:06:05.320 --> 2:06:07.320]  at Infowarsstore.com.
[2:06:07.320 --> 2:06:11.320]  And so Alex is off today taking care of some serious business.
[2:06:11.320 --> 2:06:14.320]  I saw some people commenting on the show yesterday
[2:06:14.320 --> 2:06:16.320]  that I hosted like, oh, where's Alex?
[2:06:16.320 --> 2:06:18.320]  Taking a break? What the heck, man?
[2:06:18.320 --> 2:06:21.320]  No, you even see Alex when he does actually take a vacation.
[2:06:21.320 --> 2:06:23.320]  He doesn't take a break. He's still here every day
[2:06:23.320 --> 2:06:25.320]  while he's on vacation.
[2:06:25.320 --> 2:06:28.320]  So when Alex is not in studio and you don't hear from him,
[2:06:28.320 --> 2:06:32.320]  that means he's up to some serious business.
[2:06:32.320 --> 2:06:36.320]  So your prayers, maybe Alex can talk about this when he gets back.
[2:06:36.320 --> 2:06:38.320]  Hopefully it'll be some good stuff developing.
[2:06:38.320 --> 2:06:41.320]  But he is taking care of some serious stuff right now.
[2:06:41.320 --> 2:06:43.320]  So your prayers are always needed.
[2:06:43.320 --> 2:06:45.320]  Your financial support is always needed.
[2:06:45.320 --> 2:06:47.320]  Don't wake up and have that moment of taking it for granted.
[2:06:47.320 --> 2:06:49.320]  Man, I wish I would have supported Infowars.
[2:06:49.320 --> 2:06:52.320]  I just want to spread the links because we get censored out of existence.
[2:06:52.320 --> 2:06:54.320]  But right now you've come through.
[2:06:54.320 --> 2:06:57.320]  We're still here. We're on air 10 hours a day,
[2:06:57.320 --> 2:07:01.320]  minimum six days a week, most times seven days a week now.
[2:07:01.320 --> 2:07:04.320]  So it's all thanks to your support at Infowarsstore.com.
[2:07:04.320 --> 2:07:07.320]  Big specials happening at Infowarsstore.com.
[2:07:07.320 --> 2:07:12.320]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and check that out while it's still available.
[2:07:12.320 --> 2:07:14.320]  All right. Do we have a call screen?
[2:07:14.320 --> 2:07:15.320]  Like, what's going on, guys?
[2:07:15.320 --> 2:07:18.320]  I still don't have a caller board over here.
[2:07:18.320 --> 2:07:23.320]  Okay.
[2:07:23.320 --> 2:07:25.320]  Okay. Got you. Got you.
[2:07:25.320 --> 2:07:27.320]  All right. Well, that's just fine.
[2:07:27.320 --> 2:07:29.320]  Okay. There it is.
[2:07:29.320 --> 2:07:33.320]  Sorry, guys. No, I sprung this on the crew last minute.
[2:07:33.320 --> 2:07:35.320]  They weren't prepared for this. Nobody's bad here.
[2:07:35.320 --> 2:07:38.320]  We are just live. We don't script anything.
[2:07:38.320 --> 2:07:40.320]  It's totally from the seat of our pants.
[2:07:40.320 --> 2:07:43.320]  So they were just, they had to reset the caller board and everything
[2:07:43.320 --> 2:07:45.320]  because I gave them like five minutes to do it.
[2:07:45.320 --> 2:07:47.320]  But we got the calls up now.
[2:07:47.320 --> 2:07:49.320]  The board in front of me and we're ready to go.
[2:07:49.320 --> 2:07:52.320]  I can take probably a call here and then we'll really bear down
[2:07:52.320 --> 2:07:56.320]  and take your calls for the rest of this hour until Gerald Salenty takes over.
[2:07:56.320 --> 2:07:58.320]  Speaking of bearing down and taking calls,
[2:07:58.320 --> 2:08:03.320]  we have Bear, who is called in from Wyoming. Bear, you are on the Alex Jones show.
[2:08:03.320 --> 2:08:05.320]  Go ahead.
[2:08:05.320 --> 2:08:07.320]  So I'm glad to see you.
[2:08:07.320 --> 2:08:14.320]  Hey, I'm a longtime listener, 24-hour streamer of the Infowar.
[2:08:14.320 --> 2:08:18.320]  Anyway, it's getting real hard and real difficult to stream you guys.
[2:08:18.320 --> 2:08:20.320]  Censorship has been going wild.
[2:08:20.320 --> 2:08:25.320]  They've been messing with audio feeds, other things and whatnot,
[2:08:25.320 --> 2:08:27.320]  and it's been pretty hard.
[2:08:27.320 --> 2:08:30.320]  People ask me why I do it and I'll tell you why.
[2:08:30.320 --> 2:08:32.320]  It's because you're great products, guys.
[2:08:32.320 --> 2:08:35.320]  You've literally saved my life.
[2:08:35.320 --> 2:08:40.320]  The X2 opened my mind up, cleared me up more spiritually,
[2:08:40.320 --> 2:08:42.320]  and I got to thank you for it.
[2:08:42.320 --> 2:08:44.320]  Anyway, I know you've got a lot of other callers,
[2:08:44.320 --> 2:08:50.320]  and if you'd like to catch me, I'm over on Bear's place, over on Twitch 24-7,
[2:08:50.320 --> 2:08:52.320]  where I try to be.
[2:08:52.320 --> 2:08:55.320]  Y'all have a good night and we'll talk to you later. Thanks.
[2:08:55.320 --> 2:08:57.320]  Thank you, Bear.
[2:08:57.320 --> 2:09:02.320]  And you know, look, I got to be honest, you know, I stream Infowars as well in the morning,
[2:09:02.320 --> 2:09:03.320]  the American Journal with Harrison Smith.
[2:09:03.320 --> 2:09:05.320]  If I'm not hosting the Alex Jones show, the Alex Jones show,
[2:09:05.320 --> 2:09:09.320]  and then obviously, you know, my show and friends and family tune in.
[2:09:09.320 --> 2:09:12.320]  I mean, I don't want to make a big fuss of it. People understand we're under attack.
[2:09:12.320 --> 2:09:14.320]  We have to build our own infrastructure.
[2:09:14.320 --> 2:09:18.320]  But, you know, I'm well aware of the technical glitches,
[2:09:18.320 --> 2:09:22.320]  and believe me, it frustrates me just as much as you.
[2:09:22.320 --> 2:09:26.320]  And so, I don't really know what else to say or do about it.
[2:09:26.320 --> 2:09:33.320]  I mean, believe me, it's a pet peeve of mine, too.
[2:09:33.320 --> 2:09:41.320]  And I mean, I would just say this, how about this?
[2:09:41.320 --> 2:09:48.320]  I will open up my email because, believe me, folks, I want these things taken care of.
[2:09:48.320 --> 2:09:53.320]  I'm not a tech guy. I don't deal with the IT department here.
[2:09:53.320 --> 2:09:56.320]  And they're great guys. I don't know what it is that they deal with.
[2:09:56.320 --> 2:09:58.320]  I don't know why, you know, you're having these problems.
[2:09:58.320 --> 2:10:02.320]  But believe me, I hear your complaints. But I'll tell you what, we need to do something about it.
[2:10:02.320 --> 2:10:08.320]  We want to be better. I will open up my email owensatinfowars.com,
[2:10:08.320 --> 2:10:14.320]  send me all of your technical glitches, and I will forward those to the IT team,
[2:10:14.320 --> 2:10:17.320]  and we'll see if they can do anything about it.
[2:10:17.320 --> 2:10:21.320]  Again, we're under all kinds of attack here beyond just the censorship.
[2:10:21.320 --> 2:10:25.320]  I'm not an IT guy. I don't work with the IT department.
[2:10:25.320 --> 2:10:30.320]  But, believe me, I get frustrated when you see some of the glitches that are ongoing,
[2:10:30.320 --> 2:10:32.320]  and they seem to never be fixed.
[2:10:32.320 --> 2:10:36.320]  So, you know what? We'll work on that. We'll work on that.
[2:10:36.320 --> 2:10:43.320]  Send me any glitches you have to owensatinfowars.com, owensatinfowars.com.
[2:10:43.320 --> 2:11:12.320]  I'll forward those to the IT team here. Maybe we can get some of this stuff figured out.
[2:11:13.320 --> 2:11:20.320]  To change the very DNA of the human species, to mutate us into a form that they can control,
[2:11:20.320 --> 2:11:22.320]  like a pawn on a chessboard.
[2:11:22.320 --> 2:11:26.320]  The bottom line is they want to play God, they are playing God,
[2:11:26.320 --> 2:11:30.320]  and the news is only going to tie it around our necks from here on out.
[2:11:30.320 --> 2:11:34.320]  So many other people want to be positive, they want to put out fake news,
[2:11:34.320 --> 2:11:37.320]  and want to only cover limited amounts of what's happening with New World Order,
[2:11:37.320 --> 2:11:41.320]  but at the end of the day, it's all about depopulation, it's all about world government,
[2:11:41.320 --> 2:11:44.320]  it's all about the end of the human system as we know it,
[2:11:44.320 --> 2:11:48.320]  and on its ashes, a nightmare being built, only admitting it can turn around and stop it.
[2:11:48.320 --> 2:11:52.320]  Alex Jones here with the new InfoWars sale, and it is a fantastic sale.
[2:11:52.320 --> 2:11:56.320]  It is many of our best-selling products that just so happened to also be selling out,
[2:11:56.320 --> 2:12:02.320]  but despite that, they're 50% off and free shipping on these select items.
[2:12:02.320 --> 2:12:06.320]  Again, all of these are selling out except for Rainforest, it finally came back into stock.
[2:12:06.320 --> 2:12:09.320]  It's amazing, it's 50% off and free shipping.
[2:12:09.320 --> 2:12:14.320]  We've got The Toothpaste, The Mouthwash, The Cabochill, The Vazo Beats, The Alpha Power.
[2:12:14.320 --> 2:12:21.320]  All of these are best-sellers, 50% off and free shipping at infowarsstore.com,
[2:12:21.320 --> 2:12:25.320]  or AAA-253-3139, and it funds our operation.
[2:12:25.320 --> 2:12:29.320]  Plus, all of the Immersed Essentials, Essential Oils, Natural Deodorants,
[2:12:29.320 --> 2:12:32.320]  Shampoos, Conditioners, a whole host of products.
[2:12:32.320 --> 2:12:36.320]  The entire Immersed Essentials line is close to selling out, more coming in a few months,
[2:12:36.320 --> 2:12:42.320]  but despite that, right now, ladies and gentlemen, they're all 50% off as well with free shipping.
[2:12:42.320 --> 2:12:47.320]  Just follow the manners at infowarsstore.com to huge savings, and it funds the InfoWare, a 360 win.
[2:12:51.320 --> 2:12:54.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:13:01.320 --> 2:13:05.320]  We're going to take a bunch of phone calls here, and then Alex Jones is going to be joining us.
[2:13:05.320 --> 2:13:11.320]  A couple breaking news stories. We have another white supremacist attack on an Asian man.
[2:13:11.320 --> 2:13:16.320]  Guys, you want to get the white supremacist here who attacked an Asian man on the subway in New York.
[2:13:16.320 --> 2:13:19.320]  Can we get a shot here of the white supremacist that did that? Yes, thank you.
[2:13:19.320 --> 2:13:24.320]  There he goes, awfully black skinned for a white supremacist there.
[2:13:24.320 --> 2:13:28.320]  So yet another white supremacist attack on an Asian man on the subway, so that's good.
[2:13:28.320 --> 2:13:36.320]  A medical examiner, that nice lady that died after the COVID vaccine, medical examiner says,
[2:13:36.320 --> 2:13:41.320]  no, it was not the vaccine, but my crew was reading the story during the break.
[2:13:41.320 --> 2:13:44.320]  They still don't know the cause of death, though, so they don't know the cause of death.
[2:13:44.320 --> 2:13:49.320]  They just know it wasn't the vaccine. That's not how that works.
[2:13:49.320 --> 2:13:52.320]  It was the vaccine. You're not going to fool anybody.
[2:13:52.320 --> 2:13:56.320]  Hey, but you'll get a free donut if you take a vaccine, so go get a free donut.
[2:13:56.320 --> 2:14:04.320]  We go back out to the phone lines. Jesse calling in from Missouri on the Alex Jones show. Go ahead.
[2:14:04.320 --> 2:14:09.320]  I've been dying to talk to you since your Sunday show yesterday.
[2:14:09.320 --> 2:14:11.320]  Well, you got through.
[2:14:11.320 --> 2:14:17.320]  Yeah, I did. I said a little prayer and then you turned the phones on, so that made that happen.
[2:14:17.320 --> 2:14:21.320]  So if I'm not discounting what you're saying at all, I totally agree.
[2:14:21.320 --> 2:14:26.320]  There's probably millions of people pouring across the border right now. Would it be possible to send a crew out,
[2:14:26.320 --> 2:14:29.320]  an InfoWars crew out to video that and catch that happening?
[2:14:29.320 --> 2:14:31.320]  Yeah, here's the problem.
[2:14:31.320 --> 2:14:32.320]  They'll bust it wide open.
[2:14:32.320 --> 2:14:38.320]  Here's the problem. We basically are down to three reporters, and we're all on air three hours a day.
[2:14:38.320 --> 2:14:44.320]  So we're trying to expand. We're kind of at max capacity right now.
[2:14:44.320 --> 2:14:48.320]  I mean, if we had like a flood of cash come in at InfoWarsStore.com,
[2:14:48.320 --> 2:14:51.320]  like, I mean, a flood of cash, then maybe we could hire another reporter.
[2:14:51.320 --> 2:14:58.320]  We just don't have the capital, and all of our reporters are on air in studio every day.
[2:14:58.320 --> 2:15:07.320]  So it's kind of a frustration, you know, and Alex is having to do a lot of things outside of the studio,
[2:15:07.320 --> 2:15:09.320]  handling a lot of work issues. I mean, that's part of the problem too.
[2:15:09.320 --> 2:15:14.320]  The number one voice on air here is also the business manager and, I mean, everything,
[2:15:14.320 --> 2:15:19.320]  the technical director, the strategist, everything. So it's like, so when he goes out,
[2:15:19.320 --> 2:15:22.320]  then I have to fill in and then we have the depth chart rotation and everything.
[2:15:22.320 --> 2:15:28.320]  So the good news is whether or not there's an official representative InfoWars down at the border
[2:15:28.320 --> 2:15:33.320]  or at the event coming up on Friday, a lot of these people are in touch with me.
[2:15:33.320 --> 2:15:35.320]  They're sending me intel. They're sending me news reports.
[2:15:35.320 --> 2:15:38.320]  So we'll at least have access to what's going on.
[2:15:38.320 --> 2:15:42.320]  But as far as a reporter being down there, we just literally don't have one.
[2:15:42.320 --> 2:15:45.320]  So, you know, I can't be in two places at once.
[2:15:45.320 --> 2:15:48.320]  But we'll see. We're going to try to cover it.
[2:15:48.320 --> 2:15:51.320]  The good news is, again, though, you've got other people to go out there and do it.
[2:15:51.320 --> 2:15:54.320]  I mean, Fox News is covering it. It's pretty much the only one.
[2:15:54.320 --> 2:15:58.320]  But even NBC News and people sent out there and they're like, they talked to the illegal immigrants.
[2:15:58.320 --> 2:15:59.320]  They're like, yeah, we're coming in for Biden.
[2:15:59.320 --> 2:16:03.320]  So, I mean, it's not a complete necessity that InfoWars is there right now.
[2:16:03.320 --> 2:16:05.320]  That's why we're not, because other people are.
[2:16:05.320 --> 2:16:10.320]  But maybe we'll have a presence there.
[2:16:10.320 --> 2:16:15.320]  Yeah, I know you guys have done it before in the past, so that was my thought on it.
[2:16:15.320 --> 2:16:20.320]  Yeah, and of course, it was Joe Biggs who used to work here, who went down to the border.
[2:16:20.320 --> 2:16:23.320]  This is when we had like five reporters.
[2:16:23.320 --> 2:16:25.320]  We're down to basically none, just show hosts now.
[2:16:25.320 --> 2:16:28.320]  I mean, I do field reports, but I'm on air every day.
[2:16:28.320 --> 2:16:30.320]  I have to fill in for the Alex Jones show when he's out.
[2:16:30.320 --> 2:16:32.320]  So, I mean, it's just impossible.
[2:16:32.320 --> 2:16:34.320]  But yeah, we sent Joe Biggs down there.
[2:16:34.320 --> 2:16:38.320]  He was down to the border for a couple hours, caught smugglers, drug smugglers,
[2:16:38.320 --> 2:16:40.320]  all kinds of illegal border crossings.
[2:16:40.320 --> 2:16:41.320]  Laura Logan goes down there for Fox News.
[2:16:41.320 --> 2:16:43.320]  There's gunfights every night.
[2:16:43.320 --> 2:16:50.320]  By the way, Joe Biggs is a political prisoner of the Democrat Party right now,
[2:16:50.320 --> 2:16:55.320]  as well as other veterans and friends and family of InfoWars.
[2:16:55.320 --> 2:16:57.320]  I don't even really go too off into it.
[2:16:57.320 --> 2:17:02.320]  It's kind of emotional, but you know, just folks, it's not good,
[2:17:02.320 --> 2:17:05.320]  the treatment that we're getting right now to our veterans.
[2:17:05.320 --> 2:17:09.320]  I mean, look at this, the veterans are sleeping in the halls of the Capitol Building
[2:17:09.320 --> 2:17:14.320]  and in parking garages, but they've just earmarked $86 million for illegal immigrants
[2:17:14.320 --> 2:17:17.320]  to get into $400 a night hotels.
[2:17:17.320 --> 2:17:21.320]  I mean, the Biden administration is taking a shit on our military.
[2:17:21.320 --> 2:17:23.320]  It's disgusting.
[2:17:23.320 --> 2:17:27.320]  And they swore to protect this country from enemies foreign and domestic,
[2:17:27.320 --> 2:17:29.320]  and that's why the Democrats are pissed.
[2:17:29.320 --> 2:17:30.320]  They're enemies domestic.
[2:17:30.320 --> 2:17:31.320]  We all know it.
[2:17:31.320 --> 2:17:32.320]  The veterans know it.
[2:17:32.320 --> 2:17:34.320]  And their time is coming, man.
[2:17:34.320 --> 2:17:35.320]  Sorry, I'm not trying to yell.
[2:17:35.320 --> 2:17:37.320]  Jesse, thank you for the call.
[2:17:37.320 --> 2:17:38.320]  Let's go to...
[2:17:38.320 --> 2:17:40.320]  Let's see what I want to do here.
[2:17:40.320 --> 2:17:42.320]  Man, oh man.
[2:17:42.320 --> 2:17:43.320]  Man, oh man.
[2:17:43.320 --> 2:17:45.320]  Let's go to Smokey in Virginia.
[2:17:45.320 --> 2:17:46.320]  You're on the Alex Jones show.
[2:17:46.320 --> 2:17:47.320]  Smokey, go ahead.
[2:17:47.320 --> 2:17:49.320]  Howdy, howdy, Owen.
[2:17:49.320 --> 2:17:52.320]  Yeah, look, man, so I used to work for local government,
[2:17:52.320 --> 2:17:55.320]  and I had a co-worker who still is...
[2:17:55.320 --> 2:17:57.320]  Well, I guess he's still working for him.
[2:17:57.320 --> 2:18:00.320]  So he called me about two weeks ago and he was like,
[2:18:00.320 --> 2:18:06.320]  hey, you know, the county's pretty much forcing all the employees to get vaccinated.
[2:18:06.320 --> 2:18:11.320]  And so he took the vaccine, and then not even 48 hours later,
[2:18:11.320 --> 2:18:17.320]  he had a catastrophic major stroke that left the left side of his body paralyzed
[2:18:17.320 --> 2:18:22.320]  and he left the remaining side, which he says fully used up.
[2:18:22.320 --> 2:18:24.320]  He's got such bad tremors in.
[2:18:24.320 --> 2:18:26.320]  I mean, this guy was the breadwinner in his family.
[2:18:26.320 --> 2:18:28.320]  He was the one paying the bills.
[2:18:28.320 --> 2:18:32.320]  They're not going to recognize the fact that the vaccine did this to him.
[2:18:32.320 --> 2:18:33.320]  You know what I mean?
[2:18:33.320 --> 2:18:35.320]  And nobody ever is held liable.
[2:18:35.320 --> 2:18:36.320]  So he got Bell's palsy.
[2:18:36.320 --> 2:18:38.320]  He's numb on his left side.
[2:18:38.320 --> 2:18:40.320]  What's going on now?
[2:18:40.320 --> 2:18:48.320]  Man, this guy, he was strong as an ox, dude, too.
[2:18:48.320 --> 2:18:52.320]  Just right before he did this, I saw him.
[2:18:52.320 --> 2:18:54.320]  We went to the range, had a good time.
[2:18:54.320 --> 2:18:58.320]  I mean, he was fine and Dandy now, you know, he can't walk.
[2:18:58.320 --> 2:18:59.320]  This guy can't walk.
[2:18:59.320 --> 2:19:05.320]  He can't even hold a cup without spilling it all over himself because the tremors are so bad.
[2:19:05.320 --> 2:19:10.320]  And half of his body paralyzed.
[2:19:10.320 --> 2:19:15.320]  Hey, but he can get a free donut from Krispy Kreme.
[2:19:15.320 --> 2:19:21.320]  And what they're doing, what these globalists are doing is they're killing us slowly.
[2:19:21.320 --> 2:19:26.320]  They're killing us softly with this inoculation.
[2:19:26.320 --> 2:19:31.320]  And, you know, they have total hands off, no legal repercussions.
[2:19:31.320 --> 2:19:33.320]  Because they own us.
[2:19:33.320 --> 2:19:37.320]  I mean, what is it going to take for people to realize that they're property of a global government?
[2:19:37.320 --> 2:19:39.320]  They're property of a medical tyranny.
[2:19:39.320 --> 2:19:44.320]  I mean, if this forced vaccination that can kill you isn't enough, I don't know what it's going to take.
[2:19:44.320 --> 2:19:54.320]  I don't think I am losing, I'm seriously losing hope because not enough people are standing up for their religious freedom in saying no to this vaccine.
[2:19:54.320 --> 2:20:00.320]  Well, now you see why they removed God from schools years ago.
[2:20:00.320 --> 2:20:01.320]  It's awful.
[2:20:01.320 --> 2:20:03.320]  Thank you for taking my call low and God bless you, bud.
[2:20:03.320 --> 2:20:05.320]  Thank you, folks.
[2:20:05.320 --> 2:20:10.320]  Look, we do whole shows where we ask people like that to call in, but we don't even have to ask, man, they'll call in all the time.
[2:20:10.320 --> 2:20:17.320]  So, I mean, just here on the show alone, we've had hundreds of people call in talking about negative side effects to their friends or family.
[2:20:17.320 --> 2:20:20.320]  I mean, they even admit, I mean, I covered the Bloomberg store.
[2:20:20.320 --> 2:20:21.320]  They even hit mainstream news.
[2:20:21.320 --> 2:20:22.320]  This is not a vaccine.
[2:20:22.320 --> 2:20:24.320]  It's brand new experimental technology.
[2:20:24.320 --> 2:20:26.320]  We won't know the real side effects till years down the road.
[2:20:26.320 --> 2:20:34.320]  But hey, take it anyway for a virus that you're 99.9% likely to survive even if you catch it.
[2:20:34.320 --> 2:20:36.320]  I mean, we're all slaves on this planet, man.
[2:20:36.320 --> 2:20:37.320]  Unbelievable.
[2:20:37.320 --> 2:20:39.320]  People don't want to accept the facts.
[2:20:39.320 --> 2:20:41.320]  They don't want to look at the reality in the face.
[2:20:41.320 --> 2:20:44.320]  Let's go to a bomb in Brooklyn.
[2:20:44.320 --> 2:20:45.320]  Quickly.
[2:20:45.320 --> 2:20:46.320]  You got 60 seconds bomb.
[2:20:46.320 --> 2:20:48.320]  Go ahead.
[2:20:48.320 --> 2:20:54.320]  Yeah, I went just really quick the scenario with the Megan Markle thing.
[2:20:54.320 --> 2:21:05.320]  I kind of saw that scenario as something that they wanted to try to get ahead of this whole diverse diversity thing because of course, as you know, they don't have a very good reputation.
[2:21:05.320 --> 2:21:11.320]  Mostly anybody who knows about the Royals knows some somewhat of their history.
[2:21:11.320 --> 2:21:21.320]  And so in order to kind of see faith, they kind of jumped ahead and, you know, brought in this young girl who just, you know, has an African American descent, whatever.
[2:21:21.320 --> 2:21:26.320]  And so I don't know if this thing is backfiring or whatever the case might be with regards to that.
[2:21:26.320 --> 2:21:28.320]  But that's what it seems like to me.
[2:21:28.320 --> 2:21:35.320]  I feel like this is really outside of everything and that Megan and Harry are running their own shenanigans right now.
[2:21:35.320 --> 2:21:37.320]  Maybe even blackmailing the Royal Family.
[2:21:37.320 --> 2:21:39.320]  I mean, it's just totally out of control.
[2:21:39.320 --> 2:21:40.320]  Hey, I don't care.
[2:21:40.320 --> 2:21:42.320]  Let the Royal Family collapse to a briefcase model.
[2:21:42.320 --> 2:21:47.320]  That'll be the funniest thing in world history.
[2:21:47.320 --> 2:21:58.320]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and full-worses that if you're paying attention, you know we've done together.
[2:21:58.320 --> 2:22:00.320]  But I'll tell you this.
[2:22:00.320 --> 2:22:08.320]  The technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[2:22:08.320 --> 2:22:10.320]  They're trying to shutter and silence the human resistance.
[2:22:10.320 --> 2:22:16.320]  So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[2:22:16.320 --> 2:22:19.320]  Everything you warned your friends and family about is around to be true.
[2:22:19.320 --> 2:22:22.320]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[2:22:22.320 --> 2:22:26.320]  The power structures are to silence those of us that they can.
[2:22:26.320 --> 2:22:31.320]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[2:22:31.320 --> 2:22:33.320]  We have the power.
[2:22:33.320 --> 2:22:37.320]  But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[2:22:37.320 --> 2:22:43.320]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come.
[2:22:43.320 --> 2:22:48.320]  That's all of yours you are.
[2:23:14.320 --> 2:23:16.320]  Get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt.
[2:23:16.320 --> 2:23:21.320]  Get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[2:23:21.320 --> 2:23:24.320]  I need your help more than ever now.
[2:23:24.320 --> 2:23:28.320]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[2:23:28.320 --> 2:23:29.320]  So pray for us.
[2:23:29.320 --> 2:23:30.320]  Word of mouth.
[2:23:30.320 --> 2:23:32.320]  Tell folks about the broadcast however you can.

[2:24:00.320 --> 2:24:03.320]  We mean down in your bed, sleeping hard throughout the night.
[2:24:03.320 --> 2:24:06.320]  It's got four milligrams of high quality melatonin.
[2:24:06.320 --> 2:24:08.320]  It's got 25 milligrams of passion flower.

[2:24:12.320 --> 2:24:17.320]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[2:24:17.320 --> 2:24:20.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[2:24:20.320 --> 2:24:23.320]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[2:24:23.320 --> 2:24:25.320]  It's liquid, so it goes right to your body fast.
[2:24:25.320 --> 2:24:29.320]  If you take it sublingually under the tongue, how about blasting off the sleep?
[2:24:29.320 --> 2:24:30.320]  It's incredible.
[2:24:30.320 --> 2:24:32.320]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[2:24:32.320 --> 2:24:35.320]  It's so popular we can't keep it in stock.
[2:24:35.320 --> 2:24:36.320]  Get yours today.

[2:25:12.320 --> 2:25:16.320]  What's going to happen in mass movements?
[2:25:16.320 --> 2:25:23.320]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[2:25:23.320 --> 2:25:24.320]  In their own words, they admit it.
[2:25:24.320 --> 2:25:29.320]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[2:25:29.320 --> 2:25:31.320]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[2:25:31.320 --> 2:25:32.320]  They're Faraday cages.
[2:25:32.320 --> 2:25:34.320]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[2:25:34.320 --> 2:25:36.320]  They work absolutely great.
[2:25:36.320 --> 2:25:45.320]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother to know what you're up to because it's another business.
[2:25:45.320 --> 2:26:11.320]  Get yours at infowarstore.com today.
[2:26:11.320 --> 2:26:20.320]  Live from the infowarstore.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:26:20.320 --> 2:26:30.320]  And we are now going to have Alex into the Alex Jones show on this live Monday Transmission.
[2:26:30.320 --> 2:26:35.320]  You think before I got live here on air, I would comb what's left of my hair.
[2:26:35.320 --> 2:26:37.320]  But now there I am getting that done.
[2:26:37.320 --> 2:26:42.320]  Thank you to all the TV viewers, all the radio listeners for tuning in today.
[2:26:42.320 --> 2:26:49.320]  I am here on the East Coast of the United States on a very important mission.
[2:26:49.320 --> 2:26:56.320]  And I will have a special report for you by tomorrow that we will be premiering here on the broadcast.
[2:26:56.320 --> 2:27:02.320]  And I will be back in Austin, Texas by the second hour of the show tomorrow.
[2:27:02.320 --> 2:27:08.320]  But really just pulling back from this, more and more I realize that the 35,000 foot view, the 100,000 foot view is the most important.
[2:27:08.320 --> 2:27:15.320]  Because if you pull back and see the whole thing, you understand it's a globalist worldwide takeover of every sovereign nation.
[2:27:15.320 --> 2:27:22.320]  But if you're going to take down a nation, if you can take down the greatest country in the history of the world, hands down, we've been at for 200 plus years.
[2:27:22.320 --> 2:27:30.320]  If you can do that and kill the idea, the dream of America, then you can bring in your global tyranny.
[2:27:30.320 --> 2:27:35.320]  And so I'm just seeing a ultra massive awakening happening.
[2:27:35.320 --> 2:27:40.320]  You know, they've got all their racial distractions and they've got all their infighting and their war of the sexes.
[2:27:40.320 --> 2:27:46.320]  But at the end of the day, that's big mega corporations that want to consolidate control who are involved in divide and conquer.
[2:27:46.320 --> 2:27:49.320]  And so I see what's unfolding on this planet.
[2:27:49.320 --> 2:27:53.320]  I see the tyranny of the globalist as a sign of their weakness.
[2:27:53.320 --> 2:28:00.320]  It doesn't mean that they aren't on the offense. It doesn't mean that we're not in trouble.
[2:28:00.320 --> 2:28:08.320]  But at the end of the day, these are the actions of desperate individuals and there is a massive sea change happening.
[2:28:08.320 --> 2:28:12.320]  I'm a well-known prominent person, which has its negatives and its positives.
[2:28:12.320 --> 2:28:21.320]  But I get to like a sensor, like an engine sensor, I get to experience things the general public doesn't.
[2:28:21.320 --> 2:28:26.320]  So if you're into liberty, if you're into freedom, you feel alone.
[2:28:26.320 --> 2:28:30.320]  I mean, I know that when I'm around people that, you know, are patriots, I do as well.
[2:28:30.320 --> 2:28:39.320]  But when you become more prominent, you get to interface with people and it blows you away with the actual numbers of people that are totally awake
[2:28:39.320 --> 2:28:41.320]  and the numbers of people that are partially awake.
[2:28:41.320 --> 2:28:45.320]  And those are on the partial road to waking up can be woken up basically fully.
[2:28:45.320 --> 2:28:51.320]  In other words, nobody's fully awake, but God, you're on the process of becoming more awake each day.
[2:28:51.320 --> 2:28:57.320]  So it's really hit me the last few weeks or the last month that I don't want to apologize the literature because it's all a process.
[2:28:57.320 --> 2:29:00.320]  I got really depressed when they stole the election from Trump.
[2:29:00.320 --> 2:29:09.320]  Even though I've been eating less and even exercising, I gained like 30 pounds just from cortisol, stress hormones that your body releases.
[2:29:09.320 --> 2:29:15.320]  And, you know, just the last year, you know, my beard's basically almost gone gray.
[2:29:15.320 --> 2:29:22.320]  And it's because the weight of knowing we're right, the weight of knowing this is a satanic takeover, the weight of understanding as a man,
[2:29:22.320 --> 2:29:28.320]  I get really upset with myself and I'm never satisfied thinking it's my fault.
[2:29:28.320 --> 2:29:34.320]  But God literally just told me, said, you got to just do the right thing, but be cheerful, be positive,
[2:29:34.320 --> 2:29:39.320]  and tell others to be cheerful and others to be positive because God's real and God's promises are real.
[2:29:39.320 --> 2:29:42.320]  And the gift of consciousness is amazing. Of course, there's evil in the universe.
[2:29:42.320 --> 2:29:45.320]  That's the nature of free will that we've just got.
[2:29:45.320 --> 2:29:49.320]  And when I point my finger at you, folks, like I always say, three fingers are pointing right back at me.
[2:29:49.320 --> 2:29:54.320]  I'm appreciative of myself. We need to be positive. We need to be happy.
[2:29:54.320 --> 2:30:01.320]  We need to be thankful. We need to be appreciative of our family and our friends and our neighbors and stand up for them against tyranny.
[2:30:01.320 --> 2:30:07.320]  And not be selfish and let this get to us and feel like we are totally to blame.
[2:30:07.320 --> 2:30:12.320]  And that may sound weird. We mean, don't be selfish. Don't say I'm not totally to blame or you're not totally blame.
[2:30:12.320 --> 2:30:19.320]  Yeah, that's still selfish. That's putting ourselves in front of God that I feel like I could defeat this new order.
[2:30:19.320 --> 2:30:26.320]  If I just worked more hours or if I just did more videos, if I wrote more articles or if I just did more and didn't spend time with my family,
[2:30:26.320 --> 2:30:31.320]  well, you know, it's worth it because I've told myself this before and I'm working like 2 a.m. I haven't seen my children in two days.
[2:30:31.320 --> 2:30:35.320]  I'm like, you're being a bad dad. Doesn't matter. They won't have a future if I don't do this.
[2:30:35.320 --> 2:30:39.320]  But at the end of the day, we won't have a future if we don't spend time with our children at the same time.
[2:30:39.320 --> 2:30:45.320]  So we've got to do it all basically and then give it to God. We go as hard as we can. We're strong as we can.
[2:30:45.320 --> 2:30:52.320]  We've got to give it to God because everything about the enemy is depressing us and making us upset and feeling ugly and feeling bad.
[2:30:52.320 --> 2:30:58.320]  When we were made by God, we've got to rejoice in God, worship God, and worship means connect to God.
[2:30:58.320 --> 2:31:05.320]  It's not just bow down. You're just in God's presence. It's so strong. You're on your knees because the whole universe opens up and it's intense.
[2:31:05.320 --> 2:31:12.320]  You're actually hiding from it. It's so big. It pushes you down like weights of gravity, good gravity makes you cry.
[2:31:12.320 --> 2:31:19.320]  But at the same time, we can't be arrogant enough at a subconscious level because it doesn't seem like arrogance.
[2:31:19.320 --> 2:31:25.320]  I've got to beat this. I've got to fight this. I've got to win. I've got to be the strongest. I'm not doing enough.
[2:31:25.320 --> 2:31:30.320]  No, you do as much as you can and then God's going to carry you the rest of the way. That's what faith is really all about.
[2:31:30.320 --> 2:31:34.320]  So I've got a lot of news to cover here in these final couple of segments for the next guest host.
[2:31:34.320 --> 2:31:40.320]  Take over Paul Joseph Watson's tomorrow. It's just a great Gerald Salente today.
[2:31:40.320 --> 2:31:47.320]  But again, I'm persecuted. I'm attacked. That's a positive. Christ said rejoice because you're being persecuted in my name.
[2:31:47.320 --> 2:31:53.320]  And again, I'm not a priest. I'm not a preacher. I'm not a Pharisee. I'm on a high horse telling you how good I am or how perfect I am.
[2:31:53.320 --> 2:31:58.320]  I'm the opposite. I, people say, well, why are you so religious? Why are you some Christian? I've always been a Christian.
[2:31:58.320 --> 2:32:03.320]  But as I get deeper into the fight against the New World Order, as world governments announced, as the Mark of the Bees has announced,
[2:32:03.320 --> 2:32:10.320]  as they openly come for our children, as they openly promote Satanism and every major music and sporting event that's national,
[2:32:10.320 --> 2:32:15.320]  we are in a fight against good versus evil. And it turns out the Bible's real and it's all true.
[2:32:15.320 --> 2:32:20.320]  And God wouldn't give us a cheat sheet. God gave us free will, but also gave us a cheat sheet.
[2:32:20.320 --> 2:32:25.320]  So that, hey, I'm not just going to give you free will. I'm going to cheat a little. I'm not saying God cheated, but you know what I mean?
[2:32:25.320 --> 2:32:31.320]  I'm going to give you the enemy playbook. I'm going to warn you because I'm not going to send you into this war without some training.
[2:32:31.320 --> 2:32:36.320]  And so that's all I'm telling people is if you don't feel fulfilled, if you don't feel empowered, if things don't make sense,
[2:32:36.320 --> 2:32:41.320]  it's because you are trying to fix it all yourself. The atheists tell you, oh, it's only us.
[2:32:41.320 --> 2:32:47.320]  Your dog or cat doesn't really love you. It's anthropomorphizing things. No, it does love you and all the studies show it.
[2:32:47.320 --> 2:32:51.320]  It releases endorphins too. And the humans love you and we all love each other and there's love on this planet.
[2:32:51.320 --> 2:32:56.320]  We need to magnify that and promote that, not be overly fake positive or be nor the evil.
[2:32:56.320 --> 2:33:00.320]  No, we need to promote good, condemn evil and just move forward together.
[2:33:00.320 --> 2:33:07.320]  But oh, and does that make sense to you that I just think since the fake election in December and January 6th,
[2:33:07.320 --> 2:33:12.320]  you and I, I think we're both really negative. You've been positive a lot as well, but we were both at each other's throats.
[2:33:12.320 --> 2:33:16.320]  I've known you five, six years. We weren't until then. Not a lot at each other's throats.
[2:33:16.320 --> 2:33:19.320]  But you know, both of us really pissed us men that this is happening in the day.
[2:33:19.320 --> 2:33:24.320]  We do as much as we can, but trust in God and take the stress off because God gives us the way to do that.
[2:33:24.320 --> 2:33:25.320]  Does that make sense?
[2:33:25.320 --> 2:33:30.320]  Well, it's funny you say that, Alex, because, you know, there's all this stuff, you know, the rumor mills about info wars.
[2:33:30.320 --> 2:33:33.320]  And it's just, we're just as real as it gets. I mean, we'll have tiffs.
[2:33:33.320 --> 2:33:38.320]  And we'll go into office meetings and pound on deaths to try to figure out how to defeat this stuff and be the most effective.
[2:33:38.320 --> 2:33:42.320]  But you know, the key there, Alex, is, you know, it really is all about love.
[2:33:42.320 --> 2:33:46.320]  And the more we can promote love and be an example of love, the better off we'll be.
[2:33:46.320 --> 2:33:51.320]  And part of the problem we have is we just stare into the abyss of evil all day long.
[2:33:51.320 --> 2:33:54.320]  It like sucks us in like a gravitational force.
[2:33:54.320 --> 2:33:57.320]  And so our energy starts to kind of fall off that cliff too.
[2:33:57.320 --> 2:33:59.320]  And that's why it's so important to get back out there.
[2:33:59.320 --> 2:34:04.320]  And the best way to do it, and you know this, is to just get into nature and just experience God's creation.
[2:34:04.320 --> 2:34:08.320]  See a sunset, see a river, you know, get on a creek, get on a lake.
[2:34:08.320 --> 2:34:11.320]  Tucker Carlson is absolutely right. Nature is medicine.
[2:34:11.320 --> 2:34:14.320]  God gave us that to soothe us.
[2:34:14.320 --> 2:34:20.320]  So I think that the problem we have, Alex, is like you said, I mean, we're just so busy condemning evil,
[2:34:20.320 --> 2:34:23.320]  looking into the abyss of the evil, warning humanity it's coming.
[2:34:23.320 --> 2:34:30.320]  And the key is to just be able to find an outlet, whether it's floating on a river or, you know, hanging out with your family,
[2:34:30.320 --> 2:34:35.320]  going on a ski trip, whatever it is, and not becoming the abyss because you stare into it all day long.
[2:34:35.320 --> 2:34:40.320]  Exactly, that's what Jesus said. Jesus didn't say, look at Satan, he sucks, he's bad, he's a joke.
[2:34:40.320 --> 2:34:45.320]  He said, get behind me. We just move forward, we build the new world, we say, get out of our way, Satan.
[2:34:45.320 --> 2:34:48.320]  Not like, yeah, they're scum, they're liars, we know they're fake.
[2:34:48.320 --> 2:34:52.320]  Let's talk about the better world we're building. Let's talk about the future. Does that make sense?
[2:34:52.320 --> 2:34:59.320]  And I think that if we could just, you know, that's the thing we know is if we could just get this new world order off our back,
[2:34:59.320 --> 2:35:05.320]  if we could just get this tyranny off our back, we know the potential that humans have with the technology we have,
[2:35:05.320 --> 2:35:10.320]  the knowledge we have, the ability to communicate in nanoseconds with somebody across the face of the earth.
[2:35:10.320 --> 2:35:17.320]  I mean, this is all empowering to humans, but it's being used against us and it's being set up to create a prison planet,
[2:35:17.320 --> 2:35:23.320]  as you named the TV station years ago, prisonplanet.tv, that's what they're trying to build with the technology.
[2:35:23.320 --> 2:35:29.320]  So instead of empowering humanity with it, they're trying to oppress humanity with it.
[2:35:29.320 --> 2:35:34.320]  You're absolutely right, and that's the key to this, is fight it, expose it.
[2:35:34.320 --> 2:35:39.320]  But at the same time, don't just fight the barn, the devil's burning down, build another barn as well.
[2:35:39.320 --> 2:35:46.320]  You know, don't just talk about the evil that's going on, do that, but also celebrate what's good so people have a choice.
[2:35:46.320 --> 2:35:47.320]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[2:36:16.320 --> 2:36:19.320]  And then, of course, we have the natural shampoo, organic.
[2:36:19.320 --> 2:36:21.320]  We also have the body wash. It's all there.
[2:36:21.320 --> 2:36:26.320]  And our best-selling organic deodorant from Enrich's Essentials.

[2:37:20.320 --> 2:37:32.320]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[2:37:32.320 --> 2:37:41.320]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[2:37:41.320 --> 2:37:47.320]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at infowarsstore.com.
[2:37:52.320 --> 2:37:56.320]  Granny Do Right, Granny Do Right. Thanks for holding her on the ear. Go ahead.
[2:37:56.320 --> 2:38:05.320]  First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me,
[2:38:05.320 --> 2:38:09.320]  I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[2:38:09.320 --> 2:38:15.320]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[2:38:15.320 --> 2:38:18.320]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[2:38:18.320 --> 2:38:27.320]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[2:38:27.320 --> 2:38:38.320]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know?
[2:38:38.320 --> 2:38:42.320]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know?
[2:38:42.320 --> 2:38:48.320]  Anyway, it worked wonderfully, and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[2:38:48.320 --> 2:38:51.320]  I actually bought this at Blocks UHS frequency.
[2:38:51.320 --> 2:39:05.320]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us, not just tracking and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well, with or without a battery.
[2:39:05.320 --> 2:39:12.320]  Now, with the InfoWars privacy pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose. Excellent.

[2:40:13.320 --> 2:40:16.320]  All right, folks, Alex Jones back live with Owen Schroyer.
[2:40:16.320 --> 2:40:19.320]  The great Gerald Salente is going to be coming up the fourth hour.
[2:40:19.320 --> 2:40:22.320]  Owen will take a well-deserved hour break while he researches.
[2:40:22.320 --> 2:40:25.320]  He needs a bite of lunch before he does the war of the day.
[2:40:25.320 --> 2:40:29.320]  Three to six PM, always excellent, always jam-packed.
[2:40:29.320 --> 2:40:33.320]  And like I said, I'll be back if the flights aren't delayed sometime.
[2:40:33.320 --> 2:40:35.320]  I'm flying out early in the morning from where I'm at.
[2:40:35.320 --> 2:40:36.320]  I'll leave it at that.
[2:40:36.320 --> 2:40:39.320]  And I should be back for most of the show tomorrow, but regardless, Owen will be there.
[2:40:39.320 --> 2:40:43.320]  But I wanted to raise this point, because it's something I see a lot.
[2:40:43.320 --> 2:40:49.320]  And as patriots, as Christians, as nationalists, as populists, as conservatives, or just pro-humans,
[2:40:49.320 --> 2:40:51.320]  whatever you want to call it, it's just common sense people.
[2:40:51.320 --> 2:40:53.320]  I catch myself doing this.
[2:40:53.320 --> 2:40:55.320]  I catch our listeners doing it.
[2:40:55.320 --> 2:40:56.320]  I catch everybody doing it.
[2:40:56.320 --> 2:40:57.320]  And it's BS.
[2:40:57.320 --> 2:40:58.320]  It needs to stop.
[2:40:58.320 --> 2:41:00.320]  Oh, look, Governor Newsom is a hypocrite.
[2:41:00.320 --> 2:41:04.320]  He's having $1,000 plate dinners with a bunch of people not wearing a mask.
[2:41:04.320 --> 2:41:05.320]  He should wear his mask.
[2:41:05.320 --> 2:41:13.320]  Or, oh, they're giving, you know, liberals are getting the vaccine secretly when they weren't 75 or older.
[2:41:13.320 --> 2:41:15.320]  Remember, that was the first group supposed to get it.
[2:41:15.320 --> 2:41:17.320]  They're stealing it for themselves.
[2:41:17.320 --> 2:41:18.320]  We play into it.
[2:41:18.320 --> 2:41:23.320]  It's this thing everyone wants, and it's this infusion, this essence that's so rare,
[2:41:23.320 --> 2:41:29.320]  like meeting a leprechaun that, you know, is basically riding a magic unicorn.
[2:41:29.320 --> 2:41:33.320]  And it's the same thing we see in this headline at infowars.com.
[2:41:33.320 --> 2:41:37.320]  And I'm not bashing Kelly McBride as a great rider, great brain who wrote the article.
[2:41:37.320 --> 2:41:39.320]  I'm just saying, here is the angle.
[2:41:39.320 --> 2:41:46.320]  Illegals receiving COVID vaccines as citizens complained about lack of access.
[2:41:46.320 --> 2:41:50.320]  Well, at first they were letting all the illegals in, not even checking to see if they have COVID.
[2:41:50.320 --> 2:41:51.320]  What about bubonic plague?
[2:41:51.320 --> 2:41:53.320]  What about TB?
[2:41:53.320 --> 2:41:58.320]  And so it just becomes an idea of, oh, look, we're being mean to the, you know, citizens.
[2:41:58.320 --> 2:42:00.320]  The illegals are getting this.
[2:42:00.320 --> 2:42:03.320]  We're all in this together.
[2:42:03.320 --> 2:42:08.320]  Do I want them to collapse the third world and flush with tens of millions of people who become political operatives and vote illegally?
[2:42:08.320 --> 2:42:09.320]  No.
[2:42:09.320 --> 2:42:16.320]  But Mexico announced 10 years ago that it was the law that all little girls had to take Gardasil.
[2:42:16.320 --> 2:42:22.320]  Well, Gardasil attacks and sterilizes a large portion of the girls that take it, attacks their ovaries.
[2:42:22.320 --> 2:42:27.320]  Now, do I want to be flooded by people from anywhere who are poor through the Democrats' control?
[2:42:27.320 --> 2:42:28.320]  No.
[2:42:28.320 --> 2:42:30.320]  But do I want to sterilize them?
[2:42:30.320 --> 2:42:32.320]  No.
[2:42:32.320 --> 2:42:34.320]  I want to empower them with liberty.
[2:42:34.320 --> 2:42:39.320]  So this isn't, and it's a great article because it shows how there's prioritizing over citizens.
[2:42:39.320 --> 2:42:42.320]  Now they give free tuition to illegal aliens but not citizens.
[2:42:42.320 --> 2:42:46.320]  And it's a plan to bring people here so they can be exploited as a new underclass.
[2:42:46.320 --> 2:42:47.320]  Let's be clear.
[2:42:47.320 --> 2:42:49.320]  The enemy's not the poor people coming here.
[2:42:49.320 --> 2:42:52.320]  They're being exploited by the globalist, by Big Tech, by all of them.
[2:42:52.320 --> 2:42:53.320]  And we shouldn't allow it.
[2:42:53.320 --> 2:42:58.320]  We show a real pathway to citizenship where people understand what they're doing.
[2:42:58.320 --> 2:43:02.320]  So they're not enrolled by the UN, prepared at refugee centers, and brought up here.
[2:43:02.320 --> 2:43:07.320]  But just to say then, oh, I finally get access.
[2:43:07.320 --> 2:43:12.320]  Oh, they're already saying, hopefully soon, how she goes, your child will be able to get it.
[2:43:12.320 --> 2:43:13.320]  There might be enough.
[2:43:13.320 --> 2:43:14.320]  Well, children don't need it.
[2:43:14.320 --> 2:43:18.320]  Even if you believe the hoax, the COVID actually kills one tenth of one percent.
[2:43:18.320 --> 2:43:19.320]  It doesn't kill any young people.
[2:43:19.320 --> 2:43:21.320]  So that's a fraud.
[2:43:21.320 --> 2:43:23.320]  And it's not a vaccine.
[2:43:23.320 --> 2:43:25.320]  It's an mRNA gene therapy linked to cancer.
[2:43:25.320 --> 2:43:26.320]  They don't want that out.
[2:43:26.320 --> 2:43:27.320]  So that's the issue.
[2:43:27.320 --> 2:43:31.320]  It should be, let's not let them experiment on the illegal aliens.
[2:43:31.320 --> 2:43:33.320]  Because I see the headlines everywhere.
[2:43:33.320 --> 2:43:35.320]  Black Americans aren't getting enough of it.
[2:43:35.320 --> 2:43:40.320]  They deserve a special clinic set up for the blacks at the sports stadium.
[2:43:40.320 --> 2:43:43.320]  And I can tell you, I was told this by a high level doctor.
[2:43:43.320 --> 2:43:45.320]  It's come out in the news and a whistleblower.
[2:43:45.320 --> 2:43:50.320]  They give the poor neighborhoods, I don't care if it's white appellations or whether it's blacks in Detroit.
[2:43:50.320 --> 2:43:52.320]  Special vaccines.
[2:43:52.320 --> 2:43:55.320]  And the other people get the ones that aren't tainted.
[2:43:55.320 --> 2:43:59.320]  So when you hear there's a special inoculation for blacks or Hispanics,
[2:43:59.320 --> 2:44:03.320]  let me assure you Bill Gates and the UN saying they love brown people.
[2:44:03.320 --> 2:44:05.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, they want to hurt you.
[2:44:05.320 --> 2:44:09.320]  And the good news is blacks especially, but also Hispanics don't trust the vaccine
[2:44:09.320 --> 2:44:11.320]  because they know about secret experimentation.
[2:44:11.320 --> 2:44:13.320]  Is the nurse injecting you bad?
[2:44:13.320 --> 2:44:14.320]  No, she means well.
[2:44:14.320 --> 2:44:19.320]  But the big pharma company is doing it just like in Tanzania
[2:44:19.320 --> 2:44:24.320]  and then a bunch of other countries they caught the vaccines coming in saying not for use in Europe.
[2:44:24.320 --> 2:44:28.320]  The Tanzanian president shot his mouth off one day later was dead.
[2:44:28.320 --> 2:44:33.320]  He was the guy that exposed they were doing fake COVID stuff and they were lying.
[2:44:33.320 --> 2:44:38.320]  He was also the guy when he was a scientist working president that exposed they were putting HIV in the vaccines.
[2:44:38.320 --> 2:44:39.320]  That came out mainstream news.
[2:44:39.320 --> 2:44:45.320]  Well, he's dead now, but I'm sure he's with our Lord and Savior because that's what God's looking for.
[2:44:45.320 --> 2:44:46.320]  People will take one with the team.
[2:44:46.320 --> 2:44:47.320]  They clearly killed him.
[2:44:47.320 --> 2:44:49.320]  He was leading all of Africa out of this.
[2:44:49.320 --> 2:44:50.320]  They killed him.
[2:44:50.320 --> 2:44:52.320]  He disappeared for two weeks and was found dead.
[2:44:52.320 --> 2:44:54.320]  So yeah, that's called kidnapping.
[2:44:54.320 --> 2:44:56.320]  So there's been a coup there now in Tanzania.
[2:44:56.320 --> 2:44:57.320]  That's what's going down.
[2:44:57.320 --> 2:45:04.320]  So you don't go, oh my gosh, the Mexicans are stealing our vaccines or the Hondurans or the Venezuelans.
[2:45:04.320 --> 2:45:06.320]  You go, no, no, no, no, no.
[2:45:06.320 --> 2:45:08.320]  They're taking disadvantaged people and hitting them first.
[2:45:08.320 --> 2:45:10.320]  And somebody needs to get those ampoules.
[2:45:10.320 --> 2:45:12.320]  They need to get those bottles and test them.
[2:45:12.320 --> 2:45:14.320]  I bet you it's even worse.
[2:45:14.320 --> 2:45:16.320]  These globalists are sick.
[2:45:16.320 --> 2:45:21.320]  So a million of Americans complain they're having trouble getting their experimental COVID-19 vaccines.
[2:45:21.320 --> 2:45:23.320]  And notice, Kellen got that area.
[2:45:23.320 --> 2:45:24.320]  Great job.
[2:45:24.320 --> 2:45:29.320]  Illegal aliens are guilt-tripping businesses into giving them shots first.
[2:45:29.320 --> 2:45:32.320]  And yes, they've been trained to how to be, I'm a victim.
[2:45:32.320 --> 2:45:39.320]  But see, now they're becoming the real victim by playing victim because the globalists want you to be a victim so they control you so they can really victimize you.
[2:45:39.320 --> 2:45:45.320]  Eligible Texans are struggling to find vaccination locations while thousands of Mayo Clinic employees are wondering
[2:45:45.320 --> 2:45:47.320]  when they'll get their dose.
[2:45:47.320 --> 2:45:55.320]  Many grocery store employees around the country complaining about the weight of the jabs while people with serious chronic conditions are frustrated by the lack of access.
[2:45:55.320 --> 2:45:58.320]  This is how they create the frothing begging.
[2:45:58.320 --> 2:46:05.320]  It turned out with cabbage patch dolls, manchi cheese, and they even made a movie about this with Schwarzenegger about the turbo doll.
[2:46:05.320 --> 2:46:08.320]  You get a new screw that you've paid in a major city.
[2:46:08.320 --> 2:46:16.320]  You could be in Cincinnati or wherever, it could be Miami, it could be Austin, it could be LA, it could be big city, medium-sized city, it doesn't matter.
[2:46:16.320 --> 2:46:18.320]  There's hundreds of cases of this.
[2:46:18.320 --> 2:46:21.320]  But people see through it now and say, they don't do it as much.
[2:46:21.320 --> 2:46:26.320]  And all you do is you have like 20 dolls or 20 toys, 20 army tanks.
[2:46:26.320 --> 2:46:28.320]  And then you show people fighting going, I want one.
[2:46:28.320 --> 2:46:29.320]  It sold out.
[2:46:29.320 --> 2:46:30.320]  It showed two women fighting.
[2:46:30.320 --> 2:46:33.320]  That makes everyone run out to buy the toy.
[2:46:33.320 --> 2:46:35.320]  Now you've got back orders.
[2:46:35.320 --> 2:46:37.320]  Now you can make a million of them.
[2:46:37.320 --> 2:46:40.320]  That's all they're doing with the shots, folks, is I want it, I want it.
[2:46:40.320 --> 2:46:42.320]  Remember, oh, it's going to be two years until you get it.
[2:46:42.320 --> 2:46:43.320]  Oh, it's only six months.
[2:46:43.320 --> 2:46:45.320]  Oh, I got to have mine now.
[2:46:45.320 --> 2:46:48.320]  This is total and complete manipulation.
[2:46:48.320 --> 2:46:51.320]  Oh, and what's your take on this?
[2:46:51.320 --> 2:46:57.320]  Well, what's amazing is that now the mainstream news, I covered a story out of Bloomberg.
[2:46:57.320 --> 2:47:03.320]  And I forget the other mainstream news article, but they're now admitting Alex, it's not a vaccine.
[2:47:03.320 --> 2:47:05.320]  It's an experimental biotechnology.
[2:47:05.320 --> 2:47:07.320]  It's never been tested before.
[2:47:07.320 --> 2:47:09.320]  We may not know the results for two years later.
[2:47:09.320 --> 2:47:12.320]  We're all taking part of this great human experiment, but it's a good thing.
[2:47:12.320 --> 2:47:13.320]  Yay.
[2:47:13.320 --> 2:47:17.320]  So they're even admitting it now that this is not a normal vaccine.
[2:47:17.320 --> 2:47:21.320]  This is an experimental biotechnology gene therapy.
[2:47:21.320 --> 2:47:24.320]  And so it's kind of like, oh, now that the side effects are going public,
[2:47:24.320 --> 2:47:26.320]  now that the deaths from the vaccine are going public,
[2:47:26.320 --> 2:47:29.320]  now they're kind of rolling it out like, oh, yeah, well, we're just testing it,
[2:47:29.320 --> 2:47:31.320]  but we had to because of the pandemic.
[2:47:31.320 --> 2:47:36.320]  And if you have a negative side effect, it's okay because you're helping humanity,
[2:47:36.320 --> 2:47:42.320]  which of course is the leftist ideology, which is kill yourself to save the planet.
[2:47:42.320 --> 2:47:44.320]  So that's what it's all about.
[2:47:44.320 --> 2:47:45.320]  Well, that's right.
[2:47:45.320 --> 2:47:46.320]  Wear the mask.
[2:47:46.320 --> 2:47:47.320]  You're dirty.
[2:47:47.320 --> 2:47:48.320]  You're bad.
[2:47:48.320 --> 2:47:49.320]  You're evil.
[2:47:49.320 --> 2:47:50.320]  And exactly.
[2:47:50.320 --> 2:47:53.320]  First, they admitted mRNA was illegal for decades because it caused so many deaths.
[2:47:53.320 --> 2:47:58.320]  Then they create a stampede, say it is an mRNA when it is, then it causes death.
[2:47:58.320 --> 2:48:01.320]  So like, okay, it is so people get comfortable with it.
[2:48:01.320 --> 2:48:03.320]  This is all a psychological test.
[2:48:03.320 --> 2:48:08.320]  But the good news is 25 countries in Western Eastern Europe, Southern Europe abandoned.
[2:48:08.320 --> 2:48:09.320]  That was a few days ago.
[2:48:09.320 --> 2:48:10.320]  It's more every day.
[2:48:10.320 --> 2:48:14.320]  A whole bunch of countries worldwide like India have banned the mRNA vaccines,
[2:48:14.320 --> 2:48:15.320]  Moderna and Pfizer.
[2:48:15.320 --> 2:48:17.320]  And so it's coming out.
[2:48:17.320 --> 2:48:18.320]  The good news is it's coming out.
[2:48:18.320 --> 2:48:22.320]  But I'll tell you this, folks, the censorship is massive.
[2:48:22.320 --> 2:48:25.320]  And that's why, and I'm going to make some announcements here very, very soon.
[2:48:25.320 --> 2:48:28.320]  Info wars have stayed on the air for 27 years.
[2:48:28.320 --> 2:48:29.320]  I've been on there 27 years.
[2:48:29.320 --> 2:48:31.320]  Info wars have been around 25.
[2:48:31.320 --> 2:48:33.320]  And we've only done it because of you.
[2:48:33.320 --> 2:48:37.320]  But behind the scenes, the globalists, the enemies are trying to shut us down.
[2:48:37.320 --> 2:48:39.320]  50 plus Democrat suits.
[2:48:39.320 --> 2:48:41.320]  They've got knocked down to six.
[2:48:41.320 --> 2:48:45.320]  But they use these to just absolutely platform us, go after our bank accounts, everything.
[2:48:45.320 --> 2:48:48.320]  That's why I've got plans to keep us on the air.
[2:48:48.320 --> 2:48:50.320]  And I'll tell you more about it soon.
[2:48:50.320 --> 2:48:54.320]  But believe me, don't take for granted that info wars will just be here in a month or
[2:48:54.320 --> 2:48:55.320]  six months or a year.
[2:48:55.320 --> 2:48:59.320]  If you don't spread the word, if you don't buy the products and if you don't support us,
[2:48:59.320 --> 2:49:01.320]  you've seen everybody else getting shut down.
[2:49:01.320 --> 2:49:03.320]  There's only a few people barely hanging on.
[2:49:03.320 --> 2:49:04.320]  Rush Limbaugh is dead.
[2:49:04.320 --> 2:49:06.320]  They're trying to shut down Tucker Carlson.
[2:49:06.320 --> 2:49:09.320]  Info wars is just as prominent as those great guys.
[2:49:09.320 --> 2:49:10.320]  Okay.
[2:49:10.320 --> 2:49:12.320]  And without you, we will not be on air.
[2:49:12.320 --> 2:49:18.320]  So please go to infowarstore.com during the big mega blowout sale on all these different select items.

[2:50:01.320 --> 2:50:03.320]  We're not sponsored by the globalist.
[2:50:03.320 --> 2:50:06.320]  And now it's never been a more important time for Info Wars to be on the air.
[2:50:06.320 --> 2:50:07.320]  We're having such a great effect.
[2:50:07.320 --> 2:50:08.320]  Thanks to you.
[2:50:08.320 --> 2:50:10.320]  We cannot do without financial support.
[2:50:10.320 --> 2:50:11.320]  All right.
[2:50:11.320 --> 2:50:16.320]  I want to take off the next hour to get ready for the war room in 60 minutes from now, 62
[2:50:16.320 --> 2:50:17.320]  minutes from now.

[2:50:20.320 --> 2:50:21.320]  A lot of stations are picking it up.
[2:50:21.320 --> 2:50:23.320]  That's coming up three to six p.m.
[2:50:23.320 --> 2:50:27.320]  Then of course there's a national journal with the great Harrison Smith.

[2:50:31.320 --> 2:50:32.320]  Thank you all for spreading the word.
[2:50:32.320 --> 2:50:37.320]  First, we have the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show with Gerald Symonjay.
[2:50:37.320 --> 2:50:41.320]  Alex Jones here with the new Info Wars sale and it is a fantastic sale.

[2:52:59.320 --> 2:53:14.320]  Now that Biden's homage to Gerald Ford and Hillary Clinton is begging for deeper analysis,
[2:53:14.320 --> 2:53:19.320]  regardless that there was a blanketed media blackout by the leftist media over his fall
[2:53:19.320 --> 2:53:26.320]  up the stairs to Air Force One due to what they clumsily described as wind related, there's
[2:53:26.320 --> 2:53:32.320]  the gold medal performance of the Air Force One Olympic event that 78 year old brain surgery
[2:53:32.320 --> 2:53:36.320]  survivor Biden, the leader of the dwindling free world, pulled off.
[2:53:36.320 --> 2:53:42.320]  The White House will obviously fabricate anything to cover up the unrelenting Biden train wreck.
[2:53:42.320 --> 2:53:48.320]  Of course, what can you expect from an administration riddled with chronic potheds?
[2:53:48.320 --> 2:53:52.320]  I have a lot of respect for the vice president.
[2:53:52.320 --> 2:53:57.320]  He has sworn me into my office as a hero. This week I hear him literally say that I don't
[2:53:57.320 --> 2:54:05.320]  think we should legalize marijuana. I thought you might have been high when you said it.
[2:54:05.320 --> 2:54:11.320]  And as the international community led by Russia and China throw more logs on the Biden
[2:54:11.320 --> 2:54:16.320]  fire, blind siding Joe's amateur administration with fire and brimstone.
[2:54:16.320 --> 2:54:22.320]  I have to tell you what I'm hearing is very different from what you described.
[2:54:22.320 --> 2:54:26.320]  Well, I think we thought too well of the United States.
[2:54:26.320 --> 2:54:31.320]  We thought that the U.S. side will follow the necessary diplomatic protocols.
[2:54:31.320 --> 2:54:39.320]  So for China it was necessary that we make our position clear.
[2:54:39.320 --> 2:54:54.320]  So let me say here that in front of the Chinese side, the United States does not have the qualification
[2:54:54.320 --> 2:54:58.320]  to say that it wants to speak to China from a position of strength.
[2:54:58.320 --> 2:55:01.320]  I want to invite Biden to continue this discussion.
[2:55:01.320 --> 2:55:08.320]  But on condition that we do it live, online, without any delay in an open, direct discussion.
[2:55:08.320 --> 2:55:10.320]  I think it would be interesting.
[2:55:10.320 --> 2:55:13.320]  While the border is thrown into chaos.
[2:55:13.320 --> 2:55:19.320]  Do you agree that Customs and Border Patrol encounter protection encounter more than 100,000 individuals in February,
[2:55:19.320 --> 2:55:24.320]  which was a 173% increase from February 2020? Just yes or no.
[2:55:24.320 --> 2:55:29.320]  The numbers with respect to February this year are accurate.
[2:55:29.320 --> 2:55:36.320]  Can you confirm that Customs and Border Protection's Donna facility was recently at over 700% capacity?
[2:55:36.320 --> 2:55:40.320]  I don't have the precise figure. It was certainly over capacity.
[2:55:40.320 --> 2:55:45.320]  Thank you. You said earlier your testimony that the situation at the border is undoubtedly difficult.
[2:55:45.320 --> 2:55:49.320]  Given the tremendous rise in surge of individuals coming to the border,
[2:55:49.320 --> 2:55:53.320]  would you prefer to call it a crisis because that's what your agents are calling it?
[2:55:53.320 --> 2:55:57.320]  Mr. Ranking Member, I'm not spending any time on the language that we use.
[2:55:57.320 --> 2:55:59.320]  So we've known this is a crisis.
[2:55:59.320 --> 2:56:05.320]  What I learned in just the past hour shows that we are now dealing with a humanitarian disaster.
[2:56:05.320 --> 2:56:09.320]  What we learned in Midland just in the past hour is two things.
[2:56:09.320 --> 2:56:15.320]  One is they have no proven clean running water at the location.
[2:56:15.320 --> 2:56:23.320]  They were using well water that the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has informed the federal government has not been proven to be safe.
[2:56:23.320 --> 2:56:27.320]  There's no telling what could be in there, including the possibility of arsenic.
[2:56:27.320 --> 2:56:36.320]  And then on top of that, more than 10% of the migrants at the Midland location have now tested positive for COVID-19.
[2:56:36.320 --> 2:56:40.320]  The Biden administration, the president himself, promised to be incredibly transparent.
[2:56:40.320 --> 2:56:45.320]  So when can journalists enter these facilities? Why not tomorrow?
[2:56:45.320 --> 2:56:49.320]  We are focused on our operations and the needs of the children.
[2:56:49.320 --> 2:56:55.320]  And at the same time, we are working to provide access to those Border Patrol facilities.
[2:56:55.320 --> 2:56:57.320]  When we can do so.
[2:56:57.320 --> 2:57:06.320]  As known, terrorists are detained by an immigration department that can barely enforce anything under Biden's free-for-all, clowered and pivot onslaught.
[2:57:06.320 --> 2:57:11.320]  People even on the terror watch list, people from Yemen and then Middle East are coming across the border now.
[2:57:11.320 --> 2:57:16.320]  So we really have a time problem here.
[2:57:16.320 --> 2:57:22.320]  Leaving Americans to scratch their heads in wonder, did any terrorists actually make it through?
[2:57:22.320 --> 2:57:28.320]  This has to be the most miserable administration I've ever witnessed in my lifetime as an American citizen.
[2:57:28.320 --> 2:57:36.320]  And if you want a quick look at popular opinion, look no further than the like-dislike ratio on the White House YouTube channel.
[2:57:36.320 --> 2:57:38.320]  Mr. Biden, America is furious.
[2:57:38.320 --> 2:57:40.320]  John Bowne, 40.
[2:57:40.320 --> 2:57:47.320]  I knew Trump was in battle.
[2:57:47.320 --> 2:57:56.320]  I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double-talking agents of the enemy.
[2:57:56.320 --> 2:57:58.320]  A lot of people just couldn't believe it.
[2:57:58.320 --> 2:58:02.320]  They're like, oh no, it's 3G chess, 5G chess, he's invincible.
[2:58:02.320 --> 2:58:07.320]  And I understand why people aren't believing that, because this is scary what's going on with the global government and the New World Order.
[2:58:07.320 --> 2:58:11.320]  But now that people hold up the fact that that's real, they won't somebody to come save them from.
[2:58:11.320 --> 2:58:13.320]  Well, Trump sure as hell tried.
[2:58:13.320 --> 2:58:20.320]  My gosh, look at how prescription drug prices just tripled for quadruple, depending on the drug once Biden signed that executive order.
[2:58:20.320 --> 2:58:22.320]  We pay the most of anybody in the world.
[2:58:22.320 --> 2:58:25.320]  That's just one case of hundreds of things that Trump had reversed.
[2:58:25.320 --> 2:58:28.320]  And now people are going to feel the sting and the pain.
[2:58:28.320 --> 2:58:30.320]  The energy cost, everything else.
[2:58:30.320 --> 2:58:36.320]  But what's really illustrated this is the trial in the Senate where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down
[2:58:36.320 --> 2:58:40.320]  saying he lost the election and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity.
[2:58:40.320 --> 2:58:42.320]  Because the fix is in, folks.
[2:58:42.320 --> 2:58:44.320]  The swamp is deep.
[2:58:44.320 --> 2:59:13.320]  Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[2:59:13.320 --> 2:59:18.320]  Hello, hello, hello.
[2:59:18.320 --> 2:59:29.320]  It's like he's saying to everybody who you can to support info wars, because censorship is the real thing.
[2:59:29.320 --> 2:59:37.320]  They're taking everybody off everywhere that will not say what they want to say.
[2:59:37.320 --> 2:59:39.320]  You have to obey.
[2:59:39.320 --> 2:59:41.320]  We've lost our freedom.
[2:59:41.320 --> 2:59:43.320]  We've lost the front of our eyes.
[2:59:43.320 --> 2:59:50.320]  And that news report that I just watched on info wars is really first rate.
[2:59:50.320 --> 2:59:55.320]  One of the things I like to talk today about is the Biden bounce.
[2:59:55.320 --> 2:59:56.320]  Yep.
[2:59:56.320 --> 2:59:59.320]  Now, I don't mean bouncing down the stairs.
[2:59:59.320 --> 3:00:00.320]  What?
[3:00:00.320 --> 3:00:01.320]  What?
[3:00:01.320 --> 3:00:09.320]  As you guys point out, the major media doesn't pick that up at all.
[3:00:09.320 --> 3:00:11.320]  Yep.
[3:00:11.320 --> 3:00:12.320]  Look at the clown show.
[3:00:12.320 --> 3:00:15.320]  Look at the clown show he got in front of us.
[3:00:15.320 --> 3:00:18.320]  There's going to be a Biden bounce.
[3:00:18.320 --> 3:00:20.320]  What are they putting in?
[3:00:20.320 --> 3:00:21.320]  I mean, look at this.
[3:00:21.320 --> 3:00:22.320]  Look at this.
[3:00:22.320 --> 3:00:23.320]  Look at this.
[3:00:23.320 --> 3:00:28.320]  I mean, you know, that's our president.
[3:00:28.320 --> 3:00:38.320]  The guy's been a nobody his whole life has been sucking off the public tit since he's 30 years old, like all these politicians, poly tics, many tics.
[3:00:38.320 --> 3:00:40.320]  And bureau craps.
[3:00:40.320 --> 3:00:41.320]  You got it?
[3:00:41.320 --> 3:00:43.320]  Not bureau crats.
[3:00:43.320 --> 3:00:46.320]  Bureau crap heads.
[3:00:46.320 --> 3:00:48.320]  That's all they are.
[3:00:48.320 --> 3:00:59.320]  These are little lie low life slum that can't get a job in the real world that get into the poly tics system so they can become a health minister.
[3:00:59.320 --> 3:01:04.320]  Look at that guy they got up there in Nova Scotia.
[3:01:04.320 --> 3:01:05.320]  Strang.
[3:01:05.320 --> 3:01:07.320]  How about strange?
[3:01:07.320 --> 3:01:11.320]  Yeah, this guy's neck goes into his chin.
[3:01:11.320 --> 3:01:15.320]  You know, it's like one big, you know, you're telling me about health.
[3:01:15.320 --> 3:01:17.320]  And of course we got Lola.
[3:01:17.320 --> 3:01:19.320]  L-O-L-L-Lola.
[3:01:19.320 --> 3:01:25.320]  Yeah, the guy, uh, woman, that's our health minister, Rachel Levine.
[3:01:25.320 --> 3:01:27.320]  I haven't heard from her and him anymore.
[3:01:27.320 --> 3:01:30.320]  Look at the freaks we got running the show.
[3:01:30.320 --> 3:01:34.320]  So going back to where the markets are going, where the Biden bounce is going.
[3:01:34.320 --> 3:01:37.320]  Yeah, Lola.
[3:01:37.320 --> 3:01:39.320]  Yeah.
[3:01:39.320 --> 3:01:45.320]  Imagine this clown, clown telling me about health.
[3:01:45.320 --> 3:01:47.320]  Oh, natural healing.
[3:01:47.320 --> 3:01:49.320]  First book I worked on.
[3:01:49.320 --> 3:01:50.320]  What a book.
[3:01:50.320 --> 3:01:53.320]  1984, Rachel.
[3:01:53.320 --> 3:01:59.320]  Honorary doctor from the National University of Health Sciences, Rachel.
[3:01:59.320 --> 3:02:03.320]  Don't tell me about health with more chins than China down.
[3:02:03.320 --> 3:02:08.320]  Anyway, going back, this is the BS they shoved down your throat.
[3:02:08.320 --> 3:02:16.320]  They're giving us $1.9 trillion stimulus package.
[3:02:16.320 --> 3:02:20.320]  Yeah, it's like saying $99.99.
[3:02:20.320 --> 3:02:24.320]  How about $2 trillion?
[3:02:24.320 --> 3:02:30.320]  $2 trillion, plain pumped into the system, artificially inflating it.
[3:02:30.320 --> 3:02:38.320]  And what the artificially inflating of the equity markets, the equity markets are going to crash.
[3:02:38.320 --> 3:02:43.320]  It's not a matter of if it's a matter of when.
[3:02:43.320 --> 3:02:51.320]  And the when is they run out of just like they've given us these vaccinations to keep us safe.
[3:02:51.320 --> 3:03:04.320]  They're giving us monetary methadone injections that are artificially propping up the equity markets.
[3:03:04.320 --> 3:03:06.320]  That's it.
[3:03:06.320 --> 3:03:08.320]  It's fake money.
[3:03:08.320 --> 3:03:11.320]  It doesn't exist.
[3:03:11.320 --> 3:03:20.320]  And they have to keep interest rates low because they got now this way they got $28 trillion worth of debt.
[3:03:20.320 --> 3:03:25.320]  So the higher interest rates goes, the higher your debt level goes.
[3:03:25.320 --> 3:03:29.320]  So they're going to do everything they can to keep interest rates low.
[3:03:29.320 --> 3:03:31.320]  So what does all that mean?
[3:03:31.320 --> 3:03:34.320]  Inflation.
[3:03:34.320 --> 3:03:38.320]  Go out, try to buy any lumber lately.
[3:03:38.320 --> 3:03:45.320]  The cost of building a house on average now, according to the National Association of Homebuilders,
[3:03:45.320 --> 3:03:54.320]  has increased some $24,000 on average because the increase is just in lumber.
[3:03:54.320 --> 3:03:57.320]  You've been to the store to buy anything lately?
[3:03:57.320 --> 3:04:01.320]  This is drag flation.
[3:04:01.320 --> 3:04:04.320]  The economy is going to go down and inflation is going to go up.
[3:04:04.320 --> 3:04:11.320]  And they're going to have to keep interest rates low to keep the Ponzi scheme going.
[3:04:11.320 --> 3:04:15.320]  And I find it offensive that they call it a Ponzi scheme.
[3:04:15.320 --> 3:04:17.320]  That's an Italian name.
[3:04:17.320 --> 3:04:18.320]  Yeah.
[3:04:18.320 --> 3:04:20.320]  What if we called it another name?
[3:04:20.320 --> 3:04:22.320]  Oh, I'd be an anti-Semite.
[3:04:22.320 --> 3:04:24.320]  Take it easy, take it easy.
[3:04:24.320 --> 3:04:26.320]  Good bid comes in everything.
[3:04:26.320 --> 3:04:30.320]  When we talk about bad Italians, look at the Italians, I'm ashamed of them.
[3:04:30.320 --> 3:04:32.320]  They brought Dracula in there to run their country.
[3:04:32.320 --> 3:04:36.320]  Oh, Draghi, Mario Draghi, Dracula,
[3:04:36.320 --> 3:04:43.320]  head of the Goldman Sachs gang, European division, former bank president of the European Central Bank,
[3:04:43.320 --> 3:04:52.320]  former guy works for the World Bank, guy was the governor of the Bank of Italy,
[3:04:52.320 --> 3:04:58.320]  and the low-lives five-star movement and Northern League brought him in to run it.
[3:04:58.320 --> 3:04:59.320]  You got it?
[3:04:59.320 --> 3:05:02.320]  I'm mentioning this because that's who's in charge.
[3:05:02.320 --> 3:05:07.320]  The criminal group is in charge, banksters.
[3:05:07.320 --> 3:05:09.320]  Remember the guy, Jesus Christ?
[3:05:09.320 --> 3:05:12.320]  Yeah, we won't be able to celebrate Easter this year.
[3:05:12.320 --> 3:05:19.320]  But anyway, it's coming up because the scum over there, Draghi, just locked down Italy, most of it,
[3:05:19.320 --> 3:05:22.320]  and you can't get together during Easter time.
[3:05:22.320 --> 3:05:24.320]  That's right.
[3:05:24.320 --> 3:05:27.320]  Oh, yeah, Easter time.
[3:05:27.320 --> 3:05:34.320]  After he drives the money changes out of the temple, cats up on the cross over there three days later.
[3:05:34.320 --> 3:05:36.320]  That's who's running the show.
[3:05:36.320 --> 3:05:40.320]  It's right in front of everybody's eyes.
[3:05:40.320 --> 3:05:46.320]  They're going to do everything they can to keep gold prices down and silver prices.
[3:05:46.320 --> 3:05:50.320]  Bitcoin, it's anybody's guess.
[3:05:50.320 --> 3:05:58.320]  Our breakout point for Bitcoin, as we're speaking now, it's in the 56,000, 58,000 range.
[3:05:58.320 --> 3:06:04.320]  When it goes below 26,000, it's going to tank, is our forecast.
[3:06:04.320 --> 3:06:06.320]  But it may go to 300,000.
[3:06:06.320 --> 3:06:09.320]  I don't know.
[3:06:09.320 --> 3:06:15.320]  It's going to come down when the government's regulated,
[3:06:15.320 --> 3:06:23.320]  and they're going to regulate it as they go digital and China's going digital.
[3:06:23.320 --> 3:06:27.320]  You're pushing this thing through big time.
[3:06:27.320 --> 3:06:32.320]  The low life scum politicians want everything to be digital money,
[3:06:32.320 --> 3:06:36.320]  so they know where you spent it, how you spent it, who you spent it on.
[3:06:36.320 --> 3:06:39.320]  You can't even give a tip.
[3:06:39.320 --> 3:06:40.320]  Nothing.
[3:06:40.320 --> 3:06:42.320]  Nothing.
[3:06:42.320 --> 3:06:44.320]  They'll know everything.
[3:06:44.320 --> 3:06:46.320]  And you know why they're doing it?
[3:06:46.320 --> 3:06:53.320]  Because these low life pieces of garbage, they don't work a day in their life.
[3:06:53.320 --> 3:06:57.320]  So they need your tax money, so they don't have to work.
[3:06:57.320 --> 3:07:00.320]  Look at the clown show.
[3:07:00.320 --> 3:07:03.320]  Look at them.
[3:07:03.320 --> 3:07:05.320]  Look what you got in Texas.
[3:07:05.320 --> 3:07:07.320]  How about Costello?
[3:07:07.320 --> 3:07:08.320]  What do you got over there?
[3:07:08.320 --> 3:07:17.320]  Jerusalem Newsom in California, Witness Whitmere in Michigan.
[3:07:17.320 --> 3:07:19.320]  Cuomo.
[3:07:19.320 --> 3:07:20.320]  Yeah.
[3:07:20.320 --> 3:07:22.320]  Cuomo.
[3:07:22.320 --> 3:07:25.320]  Fill them up Cuomo.
[3:07:25.320 --> 3:07:27.320]  Over here in New York.
[3:07:27.320 --> 3:07:29.320]  Daddy's boy.
[3:07:29.320 --> 3:07:32.320]  Look at the jerk you got up there in Canada.
[3:07:32.320 --> 3:07:33.320]  True dough.
[3:07:33.320 --> 3:07:36.320]  Nothing true about the little dough boy.
[3:07:36.320 --> 3:07:44.320]  Another Daddy's boy, or maybe a Daddy's girl, because that's the kind of cojones that little clown has,
[3:07:44.320 --> 3:07:49.320]  would be nobody if Daddy wasn't there before him.
[3:07:49.320 --> 3:07:52.320]  That's who's running the show.
[3:07:52.320 --> 3:07:56.320]  The markets are going to crash.
[3:07:56.320 --> 3:08:05.320]  We are a bullish on gold and silver, despite what's going on now.
[3:08:05.320 --> 3:08:08.320]  When will the markets crash?
[3:08:08.320 --> 3:08:11.320]  We're doing our best to tell you.
[3:08:11.320 --> 3:08:16.320]  Gregory Manorino, who you well know, writes in our Trends Journal.
[3:08:16.320 --> 3:08:19.320]  We'll be putting out an article this week more about it.
[3:08:19.320 --> 3:08:22.320]  Magazine's coming out tomorrow.
[3:08:22.320 --> 3:08:25.320]  It's over 130-something pages each week.
[3:08:25.320 --> 3:08:27.320]  No advertisements.
[3:08:27.320 --> 3:08:32.320]  Again, support in forward.
[3:08:32.320 --> 3:08:34.320]  Support the truth.
[3:08:34.320 --> 3:08:39.320]  We're going to be back in a little bit, and do what you can to put your money where your heart is.
[3:08:39.320 --> 3:08:44.320]  Toot freedom alive.
[3:08:44.320 --> 3:08:46.320]  The people are awakening.
[3:08:46.320 --> 3:08:49.320]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[3:08:49.320 --> 3:08:51.320]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[3:08:51.320 --> 3:08:53.320]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[3:08:53.320 --> 3:08:59.320]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the CHIComs especially,
[3:08:59.320 --> 3:09:03.320]  are using this to steal your data, to share your data,
[3:09:03.320 --> 3:09:07.320]  and to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data.
[3:09:07.320 --> 3:09:11.320]  They can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[3:09:11.320 --> 3:09:18.320]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[3:09:18.320 --> 3:09:20.320]  In their own words, they admit it.
[3:09:20.320 --> 3:09:24.320]  So, I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[3:09:24.320 --> 3:09:26.320]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[3:09:26.320 --> 3:09:27.320]  They're Faraday cages.
[3:09:27.320 --> 3:09:29.320]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[3:09:29.320 --> 3:09:31.320]  They work absolutely great.
[3:09:31.320 --> 3:09:36.320]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity
[3:09:36.320 --> 3:09:40.320]  when you are traveling and don't want big brother to know what you're up to because it's another business.

[3:11:07.320 --> 3:11:10.320]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:11:10.320 --> 3:11:16.320]  And now your host, Gerald Solente.
[3:11:16.320 --> 3:11:17.320]  Hello, hello.
[3:11:17.320 --> 3:11:20.320]  Great to be here on the Alex Jones Show.
[3:11:20.320 --> 3:11:23.320]  And again and again and over and over.
[3:11:23.320 --> 3:11:25.320]  And I'll stay and keep saying it.
[3:11:25.320 --> 3:11:28.320]  Do what you can to support info wars.
[3:11:28.320 --> 3:11:31.320]  They're keeping the truth alive and censorship is big.
[3:11:31.320 --> 3:11:33.320]  And it's only going to get worse.
[3:11:33.320 --> 3:11:36.320]  So put your money where your heart is.
[3:11:36.320 --> 3:11:37.320]  So here we go.
[3:11:37.320 --> 3:11:46.320]  I'll be talking about low life pieces of slimy scum garbage crap called politicians.
[3:11:46.320 --> 3:11:51.320]  There's one over here not too far from where I am over there in Jersey.
[3:11:51.320 --> 3:11:52.320]  Yeah.
[3:11:52.320 --> 3:12:04.320]  Little boy Murphy, another clown of a jerk, another piece of low life garbage.
[3:12:04.320 --> 3:12:06.320]  Locking down the state again.
[3:12:06.320 --> 3:12:07.320]  That's right.
[3:12:07.320 --> 3:12:10.320]  Think things were bad before.
[3:12:10.320 --> 3:12:17.320]  New Jersey will likely pause its reopening plans as COVID-19 cases.
[3:12:17.320 --> 3:12:18.320]  Look at it.
[3:12:18.320 --> 3:12:19.320]  Look at a jerk.
[3:12:19.320 --> 3:12:20.320]  Look at that jerk.
[3:12:20.320 --> 3:12:21.320]  All right.
[3:12:21.320 --> 3:12:23.320]  Look at him.
[3:12:23.320 --> 3:12:26.320]  That's not a man.
[3:12:26.320 --> 3:12:28.320]  That's a moron.
[3:12:28.320 --> 3:12:34.320]  It's an egotistical little piece of crap scum like the rest of them.
[3:12:34.320 --> 3:12:36.320]  Polly ticks.
[3:12:36.320 --> 3:12:38.320]  Polly ticks.
[3:12:38.320 --> 3:12:43.320]  Many ticks suck in the life out of us.
[3:12:43.320 --> 3:12:44.320]  Cases.
[3:12:44.320 --> 3:12:45.320]  Cases.
[3:12:45.320 --> 3:12:47.320]  Okay, murderous Murphy.
[3:12:47.320 --> 3:12:51.320]  You like the slimer all the year Cuomo.
[3:12:51.320 --> 3:12:55.320]  Look at the great job you did with nursing homes.
[3:12:55.320 --> 3:12:59.320]  Oh, you too lie about your numbers over there.
[3:12:59.320 --> 3:13:08.320]  Over 50% of the people that died according to some of the data at the lowest end, 35%
[3:13:08.320 --> 3:13:16.320]  of the people that died in Jersey were from nursing homes that died of COVID.
[3:13:16.320 --> 3:13:26.320]  So the little clown boys and girls locked down everywhere as the elderly from nursing
[3:13:26.320 --> 3:13:28.320]  homes are dying.
[3:13:28.320 --> 3:13:34.880]  And according to the sentence of disease control and prevention CDC, 94% of the people that
[3:13:34.880 --> 3:13:41.320]  have died from it had 2.6 preexisting comorbidities among them.
[3:13:41.320 --> 3:13:42.320]  Obesity.
[3:13:42.320 --> 3:13:43.320]  Yeah.
[3:13:43.320 --> 3:13:46.320]  Like Lola.
[3:13:46.320 --> 3:13:49.320]  L-O-L-L-Lola.
[3:13:49.320 --> 3:13:50.320]  Yep.
[3:13:50.320 --> 3:13:52.320]  Our fat.
[3:13:52.320 --> 3:13:57.320]  Our fat.
[3:13:57.320 --> 3:14:00.320]  Secretariat health in the United States.
[3:14:00.320 --> 3:14:04.320]  Hey, how come parading them around anymore, huh?
[3:14:04.320 --> 3:14:07.320]  These are the people telling you what to do.
[3:14:07.320 --> 3:14:10.320]  They are destroying the lives of livelihood.
[3:14:10.320 --> 3:14:11.320]  Look at this.
[3:14:11.320 --> 3:14:12.320]  Look at this.
[3:14:12.320 --> 3:14:20.320]  How can anybody with a brain bigger than a pea take health advice from Lola?
[3:14:20.320 --> 3:14:23.320]  L-O-L-L-Lola.
[3:14:23.320 --> 3:14:24.320]  And look at that guy.
[3:14:24.320 --> 3:14:26.320]  The other one up in Canada.
[3:14:26.320 --> 3:14:29.320]  That guy strung.
[3:14:29.320 --> 3:14:30.320]  Yeah.
[3:14:30.320 --> 3:14:34.320]  This is him shooting his mouth off last week.
[3:14:34.320 --> 3:14:46.320]  I mean, that positive results from the lockdowns as they find four people, a $1,000 fine for
[3:14:46.320 --> 3:14:57.320]  weekend gatherings, and you look at the numbers who have died in Canada, you're ready?
[3:14:57.320 --> 3:15:04.320]  Depending on whose numbers, Lancet and others, some 80% of the people that have died in Canada
[3:15:04.320 --> 3:15:09.320]  from the COVID are from nursing homes.
[3:15:09.320 --> 3:15:15.320]  But look, yeah, then you got the Ontario Prime Minister over there, Doug Ford.
[3:15:15.320 --> 3:15:16.320]  Yeah.
[3:15:16.320 --> 3:15:17.320]  Fat Ford.
[3:15:17.320 --> 3:15:20.320]  Another clown boy telling you what to do.
[3:15:20.320 --> 3:15:22.320]  Look at the shape of these people.
[3:15:22.320 --> 3:15:24.320]  Health advice.
[3:15:24.320 --> 3:15:29.320]  Get this in your head, everybody.
[3:15:29.320 --> 3:15:35.320]  Politicians are nothing more than the people he hated in high school and college that wanted
[3:15:35.320 --> 3:15:39.320]  to be class president and head of the student council.
[3:15:39.320 --> 3:15:47.320]  So now they're locking down again in Jersey, and you're going to see more lockdowns happening.
[3:15:47.320 --> 3:15:53.320]  This economy is going down big time.
[3:15:53.320 --> 3:15:54.320]  $1 trillion.
[3:15:54.320 --> 3:16:04.320]  You got that $1 trillion has been lost in the tourism business this year.
[3:16:04.320 --> 3:16:06.320]  Final tally.
[3:16:06.320 --> 3:16:15.320]  Travel lost $1.1 trillion in U.S. economic output in 2020.
[3:16:15.320 --> 3:16:18.320]  And who's this according to?
[3:16:18.320 --> 3:16:22.320]  The U.S. Travel Association.
[3:16:22.320 --> 3:16:26.320]  And the research firm Tourism Economics.
[3:16:26.320 --> 3:16:29.320]  Excuse me.
[3:16:29.320 --> 3:16:36.320]  Travel supported jobs fell by 5.6 million in 2020.
[3:16:36.320 --> 3:16:37.320]  All right.
[3:16:37.320 --> 3:16:39.320]  Look who's doing this.
[3:16:39.320 --> 3:16:44.320]  Oh, and how about this for another low life little boy?
[3:16:44.320 --> 3:16:48.320]  Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing of a little boy.
[3:16:48.320 --> 3:16:54.320]  The guy over there running Qantas airways over there in Australia.
[3:16:54.320 --> 3:16:57.320]  What a freak show where Australia is.
[3:16:57.320 --> 3:16:59.320]  They locked that down that joint.
[3:16:59.320 --> 3:17:06.320]  I think you have under a thousand people dying in a year where they got about 25 million people.
[3:17:06.320 --> 3:17:17.320]  This guy Joyce, Alan Joyce, he wants everybody that gets on an airplane to get vaccinated.
[3:17:17.320 --> 3:17:23.320]  This is a gutless little clown back in 2017.
[3:17:23.320 --> 3:17:35.320]  He's giving a talk and a guy walks up behind him and puts a pie in his face and rubs it in his face.
[3:17:35.320 --> 3:17:38.320]  And you know what the little joy see boy did?
[3:17:38.320 --> 3:17:43.320]  The little nothing clown that tells us to get vaccinated.
[3:17:43.320 --> 3:17:48.320]  He stood there like a gutless little nothing.
[3:17:48.320 --> 3:18:03.320]  If somebody put a pie in my face, the guy would be on the ground with that pie up as you know what.
[3:18:03.320 --> 3:18:11.320]  Look at this little boy of nothing, of nothing, nothing.
[3:18:11.320 --> 3:18:14.320]  That's who's telling us what to do.
[3:18:14.320 --> 3:18:16.320]  You can't get better than that.
[3:18:16.320 --> 3:18:17.320]  Look at the little guy.
[3:18:17.320 --> 3:18:19.320]  Look at him, looks at him.
[3:18:19.320 --> 3:18:24.320]  That guy walking back, he'd never be walking again.
[3:18:24.320 --> 3:18:26.320]  Oh, so, Linda, you're violent.
[3:18:26.320 --> 3:18:28.320]  You should be like the rest of us.
[3:18:28.320 --> 3:18:33.320]  Oh, yeah, you see little Boris Johnson getting a shot up his nose or what?
[3:18:33.320 --> 3:18:36.320]  Oh, his eyes like that.
[3:18:36.320 --> 3:18:38.320]  Oh, isn't it great?
[3:18:38.320 --> 3:18:45.320]  Get your Krispy Kreme donuts for nothing when you show your vaccination pass.
[3:18:45.320 --> 3:18:47.320]  That's what's going on.
[3:18:47.320 --> 3:18:54.320]  If you don't stand up and fight for freedom, we are living hell on earth right now and it's going to get worse.
[3:18:54.320 --> 3:18:58.320]  You're not going to be able to celebrate Christmas, remember?
[3:18:58.320 --> 3:19:00.320]  And no Easter time this year either.
[3:19:00.320 --> 3:19:04.320]  No Easter.
[3:19:04.320 --> 3:19:09.320]  Isn't that great? Walmart, the vaccine passport.
[3:19:09.320 --> 3:19:11.320]  Vaccine passport.
[3:19:11.320 --> 3:19:14.320]  How about a passport to hell?
[3:19:14.320 --> 3:19:18.320]  This thing hasn't been tested.
[3:19:18.320 --> 3:19:25.320]  Operation warp speed and you've got to have a warp brain to believe a Walmart.
[3:19:25.320 --> 3:19:31.320]  But maybe not a Krispy Kreme because there's really high quality crap.
[3:19:31.320 --> 3:19:34.320]  We're going to take a break. We'll be right back.
[3:19:34.320 --> 3:19:37.320]  Go to info wars stores.
[3:19:37.320 --> 3:19:39.320]  Protect yourself.
[3:19:39.320 --> 3:20:02.320]  You will need it.
[3:20:10.320 --> 3:20:12.320]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[3:20:12.320 --> 3:20:15.320]  They crippled all the other groups and we're still here.
[3:20:15.320 --> 3:20:19.320]  And as this whole new world order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up.
[3:20:19.320 --> 3:20:21.320]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:20:21.320 --> 3:20:23.320]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:20:23.320 --> 3:20:27.320]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still quasi-free.
[3:20:27.320 --> 3:20:32.320]  You can't have info wars has been proven right being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[3:20:32.320 --> 3:20:35.320]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:20:35.320 --> 3:20:39.320]  Thank you all and get an infowarstore.com, get some great 2020 election shirts,
[3:20:39.320 --> 3:20:41.320]  supplements and so much more.
[3:20:41.320 --> 3:20:44.320]  They're wonderful products and they support the info war. Thank you.
[3:20:44.320 --> 3:20:49.320]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be,
[3:20:49.320 --> 3:20:53.320]  you have to understand that this is all a test.
[3:20:53.320 --> 3:20:58.320]  This experience, this waiffulness planet is a reckoning.
[3:20:58.320 --> 3:21:03.320]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out with third dimension
[3:21:03.320 --> 3:21:07.320]  so we can decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to.
[3:21:07.320 --> 3:21:09.320]  And it really does come down to that.
[3:21:09.320 --> 3:21:12.320]  So as saddest things are and as evil as things are,
[3:21:12.320 --> 3:21:17.320]  look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[3:21:17.320 --> 3:21:20.320]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[3:21:20.320 --> 3:21:27.320]  God is the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing.
[3:21:27.320 --> 3:21:30.320]  And when you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture
[3:21:30.320 --> 3:21:34.320]  and Washington DC and Fauci and the mass cult,
[3:21:34.320 --> 3:21:36.320]  it's all about dominating your free will.
[3:21:36.320 --> 3:21:39.320]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the bad
[3:21:39.320 --> 3:21:44.320]  because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[3:21:44.320 --> 3:21:48.320]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[3:21:48.320 --> 3:21:50.320]  Why do you have multiple high quality iodine?
[3:21:50.320 --> 3:21:51.320]  Why do you do that?
[3:21:51.320 --> 3:21:54.320]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[3:21:54.320 --> 3:21:56.320]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say,
[3:21:56.320 --> 3:22:00.320]  hey, a lot of people love deep earth pure crystal iodine,
[3:22:00.320 --> 3:22:03.320]  but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and the two other types
[3:22:03.320 --> 3:22:06.320]  because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[3:22:06.320 --> 3:22:08.320]  Boom, we did it, it's popular in sex three.
[3:22:08.320 --> 3:22:09.320]  Is it better than sex two?
[3:22:09.320 --> 3:22:10.320]  You decide.
[3:22:10.320 --> 3:22:11.320]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[3:22:11.320 --> 3:22:17.320]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleeping
[3:22:17.320 --> 3:22:18.320]  and that is down and out.
[3:22:18.320 --> 3:22:21.320]  It's super strong, way stronger than knocked out,
[3:22:21.320 --> 3:22:23.320]  but they don't compete with each other.
[3:22:23.320 --> 3:22:26.320]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas,
[3:22:26.320 --> 3:22:30.320]  and it's 40% off out of the gates at m4store.com and free shipping.

[3:22:44.320 --> 3:22:46.320]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[3:22:46.320 --> 3:22:47.320]  It's very bittersweet.
[3:22:47.320 --> 3:22:50.320]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[3:22:50.320 --> 3:22:53.320]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[3:22:53.320 --> 3:22:55.320]  I care about beating the new world order.
[3:22:55.320 --> 3:22:57.320]  And it's because we have so much credibility,
[3:22:57.320 --> 3:22:59.320]  they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[3:22:59.320 --> 3:23:02.320]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us.
[3:23:02.320 --> 3:23:04.320]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on,
[3:23:04.320 --> 3:23:07.320]  but let's just say this, we're going to see this through the end.
[3:23:07.320 --> 3:23:10.320]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[3:23:10.320 --> 3:23:14.320]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at m4store.com.
[3:23:14.320 --> 3:23:16.320]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[3:23:16.320 --> 3:23:19.320]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[3:23:19.320 --> 3:23:21.320]  Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't.
[3:23:21.320 --> 3:23:25.320]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice
[3:23:25.320 --> 3:23:28.320]  when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[3:23:28.320 --> 3:23:30.320]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[3:23:30.320 --> 3:23:33.320]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[3:23:33.320 --> 3:23:36.320]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[3:23:36.320 --> 3:23:39.320]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it
[3:23:39.320 --> 3:23:41.320]  because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[3:23:41.320 --> 3:23:44.320]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[3:23:44.320 --> 3:23:49.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:24:03.320 --> 3:24:08.320]  Waging war on corruption, it's Gerald Solente.
[3:24:08.320 --> 3:24:11.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:24:11.320 --> 3:24:14.320]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones show.
[3:24:14.320 --> 3:24:18.320]  And I want to thank the staff and the great job they do
[3:24:18.320 --> 3:24:25.320]  and how dedicated everyone is to bringing you freedom, peace and justice.
[3:24:25.320 --> 3:24:31.320]  And that's our motto, and it's what Infowars is doing.
[3:24:31.320 --> 3:24:38.320]  Powell says the Fed remains committed to using all its tools to promote recovery.
[3:24:38.320 --> 3:24:45.320]  Last Friday, CNBC, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated
[3:24:45.320 --> 3:24:51.320]  his commitment to an all-in approach to the recovery,
[3:24:51.320 --> 3:25:00.320]  pledging in a commentary piece for the Wall Street Journal to keep policy loose.
[3:25:00.320 --> 3:25:05.320]  They're buying $120 billion worth of bonds.
[3:25:05.320 --> 3:25:08.320]  And isn't this a wonderful name?
[3:25:08.320 --> 3:25:18.320]  Mortgage-backed securities keeping the gamblers alive with these low interest rates.
[3:25:18.320 --> 3:25:21.320]  This is not America.
[3:25:21.320 --> 3:25:25.320]  The banksters have taken over in front of our eyes.
[3:25:25.320 --> 3:25:30.320]  Our U.S. Treasury Secretary is Janet Yellen.
[3:25:30.320 --> 3:25:36.320]  Yeah, Janet Yellen was the former head of the Federal Reserve.
[3:25:36.320 --> 3:25:42.320]  And it's not federal at all. That is a BS name.
[3:25:42.320 --> 3:25:47.320]  That's like calling it the Federal Trends Journal.
[3:25:47.320 --> 3:25:49.320]  It's not federal at all.
[3:25:49.320 --> 3:25:53.320]  It's private bank operation.
[3:25:53.320 --> 3:26:00.320]  And now they just brought in this other woman from the Federal Reserve to be her advisor.
[3:26:00.320 --> 3:26:02.320]  And they brought in this guy Lipton.
[3:26:02.320 --> 3:26:04.320]  No, no, not the T.
[3:26:04.320 --> 3:26:07.320]  But he's been dunked with the IMF.
[3:26:07.320 --> 3:26:10.320]  Yeah, he's in there.
[3:26:10.320 --> 3:26:14.320]  This is just running the Treasury.
[3:26:14.320 --> 3:26:17.320]  It's artificially propped up.
[3:26:17.320 --> 3:26:25.320]  What's very important, and we do it with the Trends Journal, is we look at international affairs very closely.
[3:26:25.320 --> 3:26:32.320]  You go back a few days ago, March 19th,
[3:26:32.320 --> 3:26:38.320]  and there she is, Yellen.
[3:26:38.320 --> 3:26:43.320]  She's got with the same age, my own.
[3:26:43.320 --> 3:26:48.320]  Well, anyway, you go back to March 19th.
[3:26:48.320 --> 3:26:54.320]  Turkey boosts interest rates sharply as it looks to stem Lita's tide.
[3:26:54.320 --> 3:26:56.320]  Slide.
[3:26:56.320 --> 3:27:02.320]  Turkey has sharply increased its main interest rate and moved to aim at halting the slide to the Lita.
[3:27:02.320 --> 3:27:05.320]  That has threatened to poor fuel on inflation.
[3:27:05.320 --> 3:27:10.320]  That is already running well above the central bank's target.
[3:27:10.320 --> 3:27:17.320]  So they pushed up interest rates.
[3:27:17.320 --> 3:27:29.320]  Then, two days later, Erdogan, the president, fired the cat that was running the central bank.
[3:27:29.320 --> 3:27:38.320]  And this isn't the first guy who's fired, because he doesn't want to raise interest rates because the economy is going to go down.
[3:27:38.320 --> 3:27:46.320]  And inflation is going really high.
[3:27:46.320 --> 3:27:50.320]  So now you're looking at the Lita, the Turkish Lita.
[3:27:50.320 --> 3:27:57.320]  It's plummeted. It's almost at an all-time low against the dollar.
[3:27:57.320 --> 3:28:03.320]  One of my sayings is, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[3:28:03.320 --> 3:28:06.320]  You know what Erdogan did the next day?
[3:28:06.320 --> 3:28:09.320]  Bombs away over in Syria.
[3:28:09.320 --> 3:28:14.320]  That's right. That murderous little clown.
[3:28:14.320 --> 3:28:17.320]  Yeah, he invaded Syria, parts of Syria.
[3:28:17.320 --> 3:28:21.320]  The United States has another part where he is.
[3:28:21.320 --> 3:28:25.320]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[3:28:25.320 --> 3:28:28.320]  War, huh?
[3:28:28.320 --> 3:28:33.320]  This is March 22nd.
[3:28:33.320 --> 3:28:40.320]  Right around this time, a thing called the Iraq War that was launched by the United States.
[3:28:40.320 --> 3:28:52.320]  By another little low-life piece of scum, garbage, daddy's boy crap, George W. Bush.
[3:28:52.320 --> 3:28:56.320]  That's right. A little boy of nothing.
[3:28:56.320 --> 3:29:06.320]  Alfred E. Newman magazine, mad magazine clown, brought to life that lies us into the Iraq War.
[3:29:06.320 --> 3:29:19.320]  Out of the news, out of the news, a little nothing of a gutless clown, a clown right in front of everybody's eyes.
[3:29:19.320 --> 3:29:23.320]  Not a word, not a word about the war.
[3:29:23.320 --> 3:29:26.320]  He's the low life that started the Afghan war.
[3:29:26.320 --> 3:29:28.320]  You know what was going on in the Afghan war then?
[3:29:28.320 --> 3:29:32.320]  The United States was in recession going down deep.
[3:29:32.320 --> 3:29:36.320]  The dot-com bus just happened in 2000.
[3:29:36.320 --> 3:29:40.320]  He takes office in 2001.
[3:29:40.320 --> 3:29:42.320]  It's going down.
[3:29:42.320 --> 3:29:51.320]  But hey, everybody's mind got off the going down when the Afghan war heated up and then the Iraq War.
[3:29:51.320 --> 3:29:54.320]  Officially propping it up.
[3:29:54.320 --> 3:29:55.320]  And now what do we have?
[3:29:55.320 --> 3:30:00.320]  The panic of 08.
[3:30:00.320 --> 3:30:07.320]  This is the same low-life garbage boy, daddy's boy.
[3:30:07.320 --> 3:30:09.320]  I hate these daddy's boys.
[3:30:09.320 --> 3:30:12.320]  Yes, the word hate, H-H-E-E.
[3:30:12.320 --> 3:30:18.320]  I hate these arrogant little nothings that are born on third base and thought they had a home run.
[3:30:18.320 --> 3:30:28.320]  There'd be nobody like Mario Cuomo wasn't there, Andy and Chrissy and true nothing, nothing, dull boy.
[3:30:28.320 --> 3:30:30.320]  One after another.
[3:30:30.320 --> 3:30:40.320]  There he is, our president, lying us into the Iraq War, killing a million people, causing us the tax payers,
[3:30:40.320 --> 3:30:44.320]  trillions of dollars to give to the military industrial complex,
[3:30:44.320 --> 3:31:04.320]  slimy prostitute media, quote him last week of how unsettling it was for him to see what was going on on January 6th in Washington, D.C.
[3:31:04.320 --> 3:31:15.320]  Quoting that liar who should be in Guantanamo for his war crimes.
[3:31:15.320 --> 3:31:18.320]  People don't care about the millions.
[3:31:18.320 --> 3:31:21.320]  I was sick to my stomach.
[3:31:21.320 --> 3:31:22.320]  What stomach?
[3:31:22.320 --> 3:31:25.320]  You're a gutless little clown.
[3:31:25.320 --> 3:31:28.320]  I was sick to your stomach.
[3:31:28.320 --> 3:31:32.320]  How about sick for leading us into the war?
[3:31:32.320 --> 3:31:38.320]  Lying us into the war, not a peep from the prostitutes.
[3:31:38.320 --> 3:31:46.320]  Do you know where America ranks according to free speech in the press?
[3:31:46.320 --> 3:31:50.320]  I just looked it up because I was looking at Algerias.
[3:31:50.320 --> 3:31:54.320]  We're covering Algeria because there's a youth revolution going on there.
[3:31:54.320 --> 3:31:59.320]  They're like 120.
[3:31:59.320 --> 3:32:06.320]  America is like 45th to 46th down the line in free press.
[3:32:06.320 --> 3:32:12.320]  And you could thank that other slimy low life character murderers.
[3:32:12.320 --> 3:32:19.320]  He should rotten hell Bill Clinton, the wars that he gave us, the people he killed in Iraq.
[3:32:19.320 --> 3:32:23.320]  You like that Serbian one, huh?
[3:32:23.320 --> 3:32:34.320]  The deregulating Federal Communications Act in 1996 that gave all the power to the bigs.
[3:32:34.320 --> 3:32:41.320]  We now have six companies controlling over 90% of the media.
[3:32:41.320 --> 3:32:43.320]  That's America.
[3:32:43.320 --> 3:32:47.320]  And that's why you need to support infowars.
[3:32:47.320 --> 3:32:58.320]  Because they are robbing us of our freedom in front of our eyes and propping up low life murderers like little Georgie Bush.
[3:32:58.320 --> 3:33:03.320]  Not a word about the Iraq war.
[3:33:03.320 --> 3:33:05.320]  So do what you can.
[3:33:05.320 --> 3:33:09.320]  The sales are on.
[3:33:09.320 --> 3:33:14.320]  They're going to do everything they can to shut down infowars and censor the trench journal.
[3:33:14.320 --> 3:33:20.320]  Matter of fact, Gregory Manorino just got unliked on LinkedIn.
[3:33:20.320 --> 3:33:26.320]  Him. What does he do?
[3:33:26.320 --> 3:33:32.320]  We must unite for peace because they're robbing us of our freedom.
[3:33:32.320 --> 3:33:37.320]  Of course, unless you get your passport that you've been vaccinated.
[3:33:37.320 --> 3:33:40.320]  Yeah, it may be terminated.
[3:33:40.320 --> 3:33:43.320]  Haven't tested the thing. That's okay.
[3:33:43.320 --> 3:33:56.320]  The ultimate fluoride free charcoal mouthwash is now available at infowarstore.com and drjonesnaturals.com for the lowest price possible to complete your daily mouth cleaning routine.

[3:35:01.320 --> 3:35:06.320]  To carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon based line forms.
[3:35:06.320 --> 3:35:08.320]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[3:35:08.320 --> 3:35:12.320]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[3:35:12.320 --> 3:35:14.320]  They are playing God.
[3:35:14.320 --> 3:35:24.320]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology to carry out this transformation.
[3:35:24.320 --> 3:35:29.320]  I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings of the globalist, it's all on record.
[3:35:29.320 --> 3:35:32.320]  You have been warned.
[3:35:32.320 --> 3:35:36.320]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[3:35:36.320 --> 3:35:40.320]  This is the end of all life on Earth as we know it.
[3:35:40.320 --> 3:35:43.320]  This is the alien takeover of Earth.
[3:35:48.320 --> 3:35:49.320]  Randy Dewright.
[3:35:49.320 --> 3:35:50.320]  Randy Dewright.
[3:35:50.320 --> 3:35:51.320]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[3:35:51.320 --> 3:35:52.320]  Go ahead.
[3:35:52.320 --> 3:36:01.320]  First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me.
[3:36:01.320 --> 3:36:05.320]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[3:36:05.320 --> 3:36:11.320]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[3:36:11.320 --> 3:36:14.320]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[3:36:14.320 --> 3:36:23.320]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[3:36:23.320 --> 3:36:26.320]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately.
[3:36:26.320 --> 3:36:33.320]  But, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket. This is working. This is wonderful.
[3:36:33.320 --> 3:36:38.320]  You know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[3:36:38.320 --> 3:36:44.320]  Anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[3:36:44.320 --> 3:36:47.320]  I actually bought this at Blocks UHF frequency.
[3:36:47.320 --> 3:36:52.320]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us.
[3:36:52.320 --> 3:37:01.320]  Not just tracking and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well, with or without a battery.
[3:37:01.320 --> 3:37:08.320]  Now with the InfoWars privacy pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose. Excellent.
[3:37:08.320 --> 3:37:14.320]  Now I have my own compact Faraday cage I can take wherever I want.
[3:37:14.320 --> 3:37:18.320]  And you can too at infowarstore.com.

[3:40:51.320 --> 3:40:55.320]  Again, you look at the faces of the freaks running the show.
[3:40:55.320 --> 3:40:57.320]  Oh, I like Nancy Pelosi.
[3:40:57.320 --> 3:41:03.320]  No, Diane Naso Feinstein's for me. Oh, no, Mitchie McConnell's my kind of guy.
[3:41:03.320 --> 3:41:08.320]  Oh, no, I like Lindsey Graham. What a freak show.
[3:41:08.320 --> 3:41:12.320]  Look around. Look who's running your show.
[3:41:12.320 --> 3:41:17.320]  State, city, country. I like Boris Johnson, yeah.
[3:41:17.320 --> 3:41:22.320]  What a jerk. How about a little Macron over there in France?
[3:41:22.320 --> 3:41:25.320]  Another little boy of nothing.
[3:41:25.320 --> 3:41:30.320]  It's one big club and you ain't in it, as George Collins said.
[3:41:30.320 --> 3:41:36.320]  And as I keep saying, we said from the beginning when they launched the COVID war, they're making this stuff up.
[3:41:36.320 --> 3:41:40.320]  So what was the big news over the weekend?
[3:41:40.320 --> 3:41:48.320]  Well, the CDC said, you only have to be three feet away, not six feet away.
[3:41:48.320 --> 3:41:52.320]  No kidding.
[3:41:52.320 --> 3:41:57.320]  No kidding. They're making it up.
[3:41:57.320 --> 3:42:01.320]  The course go like 27 feet.
[3:42:01.320 --> 3:42:06.320]  You see the facts. We write about them. They have them on info wars as well.
[3:42:06.320 --> 3:42:10.320]  Masks don't work. Forget the Denmark study in November.
[3:42:10.320 --> 3:42:14.320]  That doesn't mean anything. That shows they're useless.
[3:42:14.320 --> 3:42:25.320]  Forget that the World Health Organization, CDC, and Fat Mouth Fraud Fauci, the little arrogant boy.
[3:42:25.320 --> 3:42:28.320]  Again, an Italian. I'm ashamed of the Italians.
[3:42:28.320 --> 3:42:35.320]  Cuomo, Fauci, Draghi. What, Draghi? Dracula.
[3:42:35.320 --> 3:42:42.320]  Fat Mouth Fauci on CBS back in March saying, no, you don't have to wear the masks.
[3:42:42.320 --> 3:42:51.320]  CDC's saying that in restaurants, but it only brings down the infection rate by 1.32%.
[3:42:51.320 --> 3:42:54.320]  Yeah, fill them up Cuomo over there, right?
[3:42:54.320 --> 3:42:59.320]  What did he say in the restaurants? Infection rates only about 1.4%.
[3:42:59.320 --> 3:43:04.320]  But yet I'm the governor. I'm the governor.
[3:43:04.320 --> 3:43:08.320]  I'm going to lock down your restaurants.
[3:43:08.320 --> 3:43:14.320]  I'm going to give you the capacity numbers.
[3:43:14.320 --> 3:43:18.320]  That's right. Former CDC commissioner.
[3:43:18.320 --> 3:43:22.320]  That's the other clown boy was named Gottlieb.
[3:43:22.320 --> 3:43:30.320]  Yeah. Grossly. He was shooting off his fat mouth last year.
[3:43:30.320 --> 3:43:35.320]  Calling for six feet. Social distance.
[3:43:35.320 --> 3:43:39.320]  They got it. They're bureaucrats.
[3:43:39.320 --> 3:43:44.320]  These are people that never had real jobs.
[3:43:44.320 --> 3:43:47.320]  They're part of the system.
[3:43:47.320 --> 3:43:54.320]  Again, as George Collins said, the one big club and you ain't in it.
[3:43:54.320 --> 3:44:09.320]  The billionaires around the world added four trillion dollars to their portfolios since the COVID war was launched.
[3:44:09.320 --> 3:44:14.320]  Well, the rest of everybody else goes broke.
[3:44:14.320 --> 3:44:17.320]  The bigs got bigger.
[3:44:17.320 --> 3:44:25.320]  They're going to merge the Canada Railway with the Americans now. Oh, great. Third world system.
[3:44:25.320 --> 3:44:33.320]  Oh, great by the way, that intro before I came on in the air of the news overview by Infowars.
[3:44:33.320 --> 3:44:37.320]  And they talked about Blinken. Blinken.
[3:44:37.320 --> 3:44:40.320]  Blinken, our US secretary.
[3:44:40.320 --> 3:44:43.320]  Again, I've been a club member his whole life.
[3:44:43.320 --> 3:44:56.320]  The guy that Obama, the Nobel Peace of Craft Prize winner, when Saudi Arabia announced the war that they were going to invade Yemen back in 2015 from Washington, D.C.
[3:44:56.320 --> 3:45:08.320]  Blinken was the guy that went over there to help the Saudis slaughter the Yemenis by giving them American intelligence, refueling their planes, the Saudi planes so they could bomb the hell out of the people.
[3:45:08.320 --> 3:45:14.320]  Anyway, did you see what the Chinese did to him?
[3:45:14.320 --> 3:45:17.320]  They leveled them out.
[3:45:17.320 --> 3:45:22.320]  You look at our top trends for 2021.
[3:45:22.320 --> 3:45:25.320]  This is going to be the Chinese century.
[3:45:25.320 --> 3:45:27.320]  I talked about the train deal.
[3:45:27.320 --> 3:45:32.320]  They just did with.
[3:45:32.320 --> 3:45:34.320]  What is it?
[3:45:34.320 --> 3:45:46.320]  The Indian Pacific Railway Limited agreed to acquire Kansas City Southern in a transaction valued at about $25 billion.
[3:45:46.320 --> 3:45:49.320]  And of course, that's industrial rail.
[3:45:49.320 --> 3:45:51.320]  Look at China's rail system.
[3:45:51.320 --> 3:45:54.320]  Bullet trains, high speed trains.
[3:45:54.320 --> 3:45:58.320]  He got a New York clown Cuomo.
[3:45:58.320 --> 3:46:03.320]  Wilhelm, not de Blasio. His real name is Wilhelm.
[3:46:03.320 --> 3:46:10.320]  He uses a de Blasio name to get the Italian votes made de Blasio pieces scum de Blasio.
[3:46:10.320 --> 3:46:12.320]  Look at the New York subway.
[3:46:12.320 --> 3:46:17.320]  It's a night in Calcutta.
[3:46:17.320 --> 3:46:22.320]  The Chinese are taken over.
[3:46:22.320 --> 3:46:28.320]  And by the way, stop this anti Asian stuff going on.
[3:46:28.320 --> 3:46:33.320]  Don't blame the Asian people for crazy people running their country.
[3:46:33.320 --> 3:46:41.320]  Just like you don't want to blame Americans for the murderers like George W. Bush, like Bill Clinton, like Barack Obama.
[3:46:41.320 --> 3:46:43.320]  So cool out with this.
[3:46:43.320 --> 3:46:47.320]  The Chinese government's a different deal.
[3:46:47.320 --> 3:46:50.320]  An air in charge.
[3:46:50.320 --> 3:46:53.320]  The business of China's business.
[3:46:53.320 --> 3:46:58.320]  The business of America's been war and we're paying for it.
[3:46:58.320 --> 3:47:05.320]  Eisenhower warned us the military industrial complex would destroy the nation, rob us of the genius of the scientists,
[3:47:05.320 --> 3:47:08.320]  sweater the laborers and future of the children.
[3:47:08.320 --> 3:47:10.320]  And here we are.
[3:47:10.320 --> 3:47:15.320]  How low can you go?
[3:47:15.320 --> 3:47:16.320]  How low can you go?
[3:47:16.320 --> 3:47:22.320]  You can't go up a flight of stairs biting without falling down.
[3:47:22.320 --> 3:47:25.320]  And that's what America is.
[3:47:25.320 --> 3:47:28.320]  The Chinese laughed at Blinken.
[3:47:28.320 --> 3:47:30.320]  They don't need us.
[3:47:30.320 --> 3:47:33.320]  They're taken over.
[3:47:33.320 --> 3:47:40.320]  Unless, unless we bring liberty.
[3:47:40.320 --> 3:47:46.320]  Justice and peace back to America.
[3:47:46.320 --> 3:47:49.320]  Because as being robbed from us.
[3:47:49.320 --> 3:47:53.320]  They destroyed our Constitution with their executive orders.
[3:47:53.320 --> 3:47:58.320]  Little Boy Murphy closing down Jersey again.
[3:47:58.320 --> 3:48:01.320]  A little wolf of nothing in Pennsylvania.
[3:48:01.320 --> 3:48:08.320]  Jerks, morons, arrogant little boys and girls.
[3:48:08.320 --> 3:48:10.320]  It's up to you.
[3:48:10.320 --> 3:48:12.320]  Do your part.
[3:48:12.320 --> 3:48:16.320]  Get in the best shape you can physically, emotionally and spiritually.
