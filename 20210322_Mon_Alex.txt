[00:00:11.784 --> 00:00:22.253]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a national emergency going on right now at our Southern border.
[00:00:22.253 --> 00:00:24.295]  And we all know who's to blame.
[00:00:24.295 --> 00:00:25.696]  We all know what's to blame.
[00:00:25.696 --> 00:00:28.018]  We all know what's going on.
[00:00:28.018 --> 00:00:39.368]  And despite the Biden administration's attempts to bury it in the sand, despite the mainstream media's attempts to hide it and not report on it, it is inevitable.
[00:00:40.313 --> 00:00:54.747]  That this will become the number one story in the country, the wide open southern border, the 1000% increase in illegal immigration since Joe Biden has gotten into the White House.
[00:00:54.747 --> 00:01:01.213]  And now we have photos that have emerged from a Democrat in Texas.
[00:01:02.105 --> 00:01:04.827]  You see the media is being blocked out.
[00:01:04.827 --> 00:01:11.072]  All right, guys, let's... Okay, well, that's a meme with AOC taking a nap there with the kids in cages.
[00:01:11.072 --> 00:01:12.253]  But let's be serious here.
[00:01:12.253 --> 00:01:21.980]  It's funny, though, you don't see AOC down there crying to an empty parking lot because, well, the narrative isn't there and the agenda isn't there.
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:28.304]  But no, we have the photos of kids in cages, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:28.304 --> 00:01:30.446]  No, not AOC standing in a parking lot.
[00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.139]  With no kids in cages when Trump was president.
[00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:36.260]  Now the kids in cages.
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.663]  Of course, this is what they choose when they come across the border illegally.
[00:01:40.663 --> 00:01:48.546]  This is what they choose just for the shot at the American way of life that they don't understand they've been lied to about.
[00:01:48.546 --> 00:01:51.548]  But we have an open border and a welfare state.
[00:01:51.548 --> 00:01:54.429]  And if you do the math on that, it equals game over.
[00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:55.910]  Game over.
[00:01:58.926 --> 00:02:02.647]  Open border plus welfare state equals game over.
[00:02:02.647 --> 00:02:04.568]  The Democrats know it.
[00:02:04.568 --> 00:02:07.349]  The Chinese know it.
[00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:09.090]  And the mainstream media is probably too stupid.
[00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.490]  They don't know it.
[00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.451]  But that's what's going on.
[00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:25.135]  And so, guys, continue to just put these pictures up because, hey, look, we're not complaining about the unsanitary or inhumane treatment at the border or they're not wearing masks or they all have COVID.
[00:02:25.135 --> 00:02:26.996]  No, that's all a distraction.
[00:02:28.388 --> 00:02:54.208]  The real story is that we have a land invasion happening right now in our southern border and so also if we have the time guys we have two minutes left just pull up also all the videos the b-roll of the people flooding across the border by the thousands crossing the rivers crossing where the walls have not been completed and so yes and then they come here and they do interviews with
[00:02:54.821 --> 00:02:59.262]  And you know, I thought of something last night with Martha Rat-Jazz.
[00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:01.863]  Rat-its.
[00:03:01.863 --> 00:03:13.306]  And it's not just her, there have been about five or six, they played a compilation earlier today on Fox News, of all the different illegal immigrants coming here, then doing interviews with media saying, we come here for Biden.
[00:03:13.306 --> 00:03:16.107]  They had thousands show up with Biden shirts.
[00:03:16.107 --> 00:03:18.028]  Finally, we found the biggest Biden rally.
[00:03:18.028 --> 00:03:20.789]  We found the Biden voters that weren't in the graveyard.
[00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:22.289]  They were coming across the southern border.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.161]  Wearing Biden shirts.
[00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:26.062]  Biggest Biden rally you've ever seen.
[00:03:26.062 --> 00:03:28.063]  Coming across the southern border illegally.
[00:03:28.063 --> 00:03:30.625]  And then they sit down with media and they say, yeah, we came here for Biden.
[00:03:30.625 --> 00:03:31.725]  Yeah, we're here because of Biden.
[00:03:31.725 --> 00:03:34.247]  Yep, Biden's the one that told us to come here.
[00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:43.553]  And then the media, if outside of Peter Doocy it even exists in the White House Press Corp.
[00:03:43.553 --> 00:03:47.315]  Oh, but then, you know, they say they're not coming here.
[00:03:47.315 --> 00:03:48.496]  This isn't Biden's.
[00:03:48.496 --> 00:03:49.697]  This is not Biden's fault.
[00:03:49.697 --> 00:03:50.898]  This is Trump's fault.
[00:03:50.898 --> 00:03:51.398]  They literally
[00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:57.363]  It has literally gone up a thousand percent since Biden got in the White House.
[00:03:57.363 --> 00:04:02.005]  And the illegal immigrants cross the southern border, do a media interview and say, I'm here because of Biden.
[00:04:02.005 --> 00:04:06.326]  And then the Biden administration is either so incompetent and inept.
[00:04:06.326 --> 00:04:09.587]  We don't believe that, although there is a level of that.
[00:04:09.587 --> 00:04:11.428]  They say, oh, this is Trump's fault.
[00:04:11.428 --> 00:04:13.069]  This has nothing to do with Biden.
[00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.669]  What?
[00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:18.531]  They literally show up wearing Biden shirts and then they do interviews saying, we came here because of Biden.
[00:04:20.296 --> 00:04:23.737]  And then the Biden administration says there's nothing happening at the southern border.
[00:04:23.737 --> 00:04:25.137]  But it's also Trump's fault.
[00:04:25.137 --> 00:04:28.038]  So there is no crisis, but the crisis is Trump's fault.
[00:04:28.038 --> 00:04:30.799]  You see how that works?
[00:04:30.799 --> 00:04:38.781]  So ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroer sitting in for Alex Jones right here on the Alex Jones Show in the InfoWars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[00:04:38.781 --> 00:04:40.501]  Alex Jones is coming up on the other side.
[00:04:40.501 --> 00:04:42.702]  We're going to be hearing from Alex today.
[00:04:42.702 --> 00:04:43.642]  Your prayers today.
[00:04:44.406 --> 00:04:45.667]  Your financial support today.
[00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:48.289]  Tell your friends and family about the broadcast today.
[00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:51.251]  Alex doing some serious business.
[00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:52.732]  He may be able to update you on that.
[00:04:52.732 --> 00:04:58.636]  Hopefully good news in the future, but he'll be coming up on the other side of this break.
[00:04:58.636 --> 00:05:02.159]  You cannot hide a grand assault.
[00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:09.264]  America is about to have its energy cut off, its borders destroyed, its dollar brought down to nothing.
[00:05:09.264 --> 00:05:13.287]  All of you that have served Satan believe that you are the right team.
[00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:17.164]  You're about to find out how pathetic you are.
[00:05:17.164 --> 00:05:24.410]  So I ask all of you, who are awake and who love God, stop living in fear.
[00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.232]  The enemy is about to expose itself.
[00:05:27.232 --> 00:05:29.554]  The enemy can't help itself.
[00:05:29.554 --> 00:05:33.618]  The enemy comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:05:33.618 --> 00:05:37.641]  We sit here as good people and get upset about that and try to stop it.
[00:05:37.641 --> 00:05:38.102]  We should, but
[00:05:39.133 --> 00:05:49.066]  Once it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking us, we just have to point out we tried to stop it.
[00:05:49.066 --> 00:05:51.209]  So prepare yourselves, America.
[00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:54.833]  You're going under judgment, just like all the children that were aborted.
[00:05:54.833 --> 00:05:55.775]  This is the truth.
[00:06:15.983 --> 00:06:17.884]  It's Monday, March 22nd.
[00:06:17.884 --> 00:06:19.265]  The year is 2021.
[00:06:19.265 --> 00:06:20.867]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:20.867 --> 00:06:23.289]  On the road, Owen Schroer is about to be taking over.
[00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:24.690]  But people are really upset.
[00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.832]  People are really concerned right now, and for good reason.
[00:06:27.832 --> 00:06:32.876]  America and the entire world is in a huge crisis.
[00:06:32.876 --> 00:06:40.762]  The crisis is America right now, because we have a criminal organized group that has hijacked control of the nation.
[00:06:40.762 --> 00:06:42.644]  And at the heart of that crisis, and at the heart
[00:06:43.183 --> 00:06:43.704]  He stole the election.
[00:06:58.465 --> 00:07:03.469]  You can't have a country where you don't have to take vaccines, but every other country has to take vaccines.
[00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:04.369]  You can't have a country
[00:07:19.528 --> 00:07:25.212]  Where people can practice their own religion in peace when other countries like China won't let you do that.
[00:07:25.212 --> 00:07:30.415]  So America has to be rolled into this politically correct global government system.
[00:07:30.415 --> 00:07:40.662]  And that's what's happening right now is a process of demoralizing us, breaking down our borders, destroying our currency, jacking up our power prices, putting regulations in that make it impossible
[00:07:41.957 --> 00:07:47.119]  For you to do business inside America unless you're a multinational corporation who's based outside the country.
[00:07:47.119 --> 00:07:48.620]  This is economic war.
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.280]  And I know you all know that.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.602]  But we all need to have that really sink in.
[00:07:54.602 --> 00:07:57.183]  That this is 21st century war.
[00:07:57.183 --> 00:07:58.664]  This is economic war.
[00:07:58.664 --> 00:08:04.046]  And all the people that play along with the whole leftist ideology are pretending that they're part of the power structure.
[00:08:04.046 --> 00:08:08.628]  They're pretending they're on the winning team when really they're being destroyed just like the rest of us.
[00:08:09.497 --> 00:08:10.717]  And so there's really a paradox here.
[00:08:10.717 --> 00:08:25.421]  The left acts like they're the resistance, they act like they're fighting the establishment, but they have all the banks, all the media, all the universities, communist China, the EU, most of the cities, the list just goes on and on.
[00:08:25.421 --> 00:08:35.303]  All the big mainline churches are globalists now, piling on to get rid of our sovereignty, piling on to get rid of our families, piling on to attack the nuclear family,
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.541]  And it's all in their white papers.
[00:08:37.541 --> 00:08:38.741]  It's all in their textbooks.
[00:08:38.741 --> 00:08:41.142]  It's all in their plans to do this.
[00:08:41.142 --> 00:08:43.584]  Go watch my film, Endgame, that I made in 2007.
[00:08:43.584 --> 00:08:47.886]  Hard to believe now, 14 years ago.
[00:08:47.886 --> 00:08:51.367]  And in that film, I say we're going to be in lockdown cities.
[00:08:51.367 --> 00:08:53.448]  We're going to use fake bio-attacks to do it.
[00:08:53.448 --> 00:08:55.930]  The family will be coming obsolete.
[00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.031]  Everything we do will be surveilled.
[00:08:58.031 --> 00:09:03.353]  You'll have a special tracking system, where if you're not a good globalist, you won't even be able to buy or sell.
[00:09:03.353 --> 00:09:04.734]  This is the system
[00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.371]  That has been established.
[00:09:07.371 --> 00:09:10.472]  And it's a predatory system.
[00:09:10.472 --> 00:09:25.258]  So people can live in denial all they want about this, but this is the establishment, this is the UN, this is the big global governance power system overriding nation states, overriding regional governments, and overriding individual freedoms.
[00:09:25.258 --> 00:09:26.759]  They're above the law.
[00:09:26.759 --> 00:09:30.380]  Think of it as global eminent domain.
[00:09:31.281 --> 00:09:35.164]  It's a great piece of satire, a great piece of comedy, science fiction.
[00:09:35.164 --> 00:09:37.886]  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
[00:09:37.886 --> 00:09:42.990]  And the aliens show up, and they give people five minutes to evacuate, because they're building a space highway through.
[00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.872]  They're about to blow your planet up.
[00:09:44.872 --> 00:09:46.413]  And for the globalists, that's how they think.
[00:09:46.413 --> 00:09:49.315]  Klaus Schwab's talked about it, Ray Kurzweil's talked about it.
[00:09:49.315 --> 00:09:51.057]  You can read their quotes.
[00:09:51.057 --> 00:09:53.258]  You can see their quotes in my film, Endgame.
[00:09:53.258 --> 00:09:55.220]  From many of them.
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.142]  Saying, when we merge with machines around the year 2035,
[00:09:59.944 --> 00:10:01.986]  You'll be like a house plant if you're lucky.
[00:10:01.986 --> 00:10:05.229]  If not, you'll be like an ant we just step on.
[00:10:05.229 --> 00:10:06.431]  Just totally disregarded.
[00:10:06.431 --> 00:10:13.117]  Now, whether that's really going to happen or not, whether they're going to become these AI gods, I tend to say that's a bunch of delusions of grandeur.
[00:10:13.117 --> 00:10:19.043]  But regardless, this is the attitude and the perspective they come at people with.
[00:10:19.043 --> 00:10:19.444]  And it was
[00:10:20.726 --> 00:10:28.089]  Aldous Huxley, who wrote Brave New World, who later wrote Brave New World Revisited in 1961 before he died, who said, hey, this is all really our plan.
[00:10:28.089 --> 00:10:31.330]  His brother ran the UN at the time, Julian Huxley.
[00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:42.414]  And he said, unlike 1984, George Orwell's vision of the future, it's going to be one with propaganda and drugs and entertainment, where you're mesmerized, positronically
[00:10:43.323 --> 00:11:08.871]  electronically and chemically where you'll love your servitude where you will enjoy your servitude because you're going to be in a trance state and now all the medical literature shows the average TV head is in a near trance state of a very highly suggestible close to daydreaming close to dreaming state where they flicker in and out of consciousness and are just being programmed by the devices by the phones by all the rest of it
[00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:12.082]  And so you have to become conscious of that.
[00:11:12.082 --> 00:11:35.549]  In fact, I've seen a lot of psychiatrists and I've seen a lot of psychologists who are involved in psychological warfare and advertising and they will say, you've got to get inside your head, you've got to realize you are who you are and kind of create like a horizon like you're flying an airplane and anchor yourself to that when you are engaged in all this propaganda against the general public or you yourself will get lost in it.
[00:11:35.549 --> 00:11:38.290]  Well, the truth is they have gotten lost in it.
[00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:46.956]  How does Klaus Schwab and Ted Turner and Bill Gates and all these people think they're going to carry all this out against humanity and then get away with it in the end?
[00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:48.938]  They're obviously not.
[00:11:48.938 --> 00:11:51.299]  They call this a breakaway civilization.
[00:11:51.299 --> 00:11:55.182]  This is your future if you let them guide us towards it.
[00:11:55.182 --> 00:11:59.304]  We're like moths to the flame following along with these people and so are they.
[00:11:59.304 --> 00:12:07.750]  They're just moths that went first before us and have already been basically caught up in their own megalomaniacal delusions of grandeur.
[00:12:08.533 --> 00:12:21.521]  These are megalomaniacs, and now you see the border being completely dissolved, and children being smuggled across, and the press secretary saying, as long as you got a kid, you can get in the country free, we're just going to let you in for human smuggling.
[00:12:21.521 --> 00:12:27.885]  But, oh, we're not going to test illegal aliens for COVID, or tuberculosis, or anything else, but we're going to test you.
[00:12:27.885 --> 00:12:31.667]  And your businesses are going to stay closed, but the big box stores are going to stay open.
[00:12:31.667 --> 00:12:37.931]  This is all economic warfare, and it came out on the Telegraph yesterday, that China is the big winner of the
[00:12:39.199 --> 00:12:45.083]  And China doubled its wealth, and so did Big Tech with its partners, because they're the ones that ran it.
[00:12:45.083 --> 00:12:46.964]  They launched the attack out of Wuhan.
[00:12:46.964 --> 00:12:49.586]  They showed all the hysteria and the fear.
[00:12:49.586 --> 00:12:51.327]  They panicked the general public.
[00:12:51.327 --> 00:12:58.572]  They created the perception that everyone needed to basically run into their houses and never come out again.
[00:12:59.384 --> 00:13:04.626]  And so now they are the beneficiaries of the giant PSYOP that they ran.
[00:13:04.626 --> 00:13:21.032]  And until you realize you've been conned and that you're not part of the establishment, until you realize the whole thing's a lie and this is predatory, and until you as a conservative or a liberal or a Christian or a Buddhist or a Muslim or an atheist understand that there is a scientific dictatorship that is manipulating and controlling society,
[00:13:22.017 --> 00:13:23.558]  That is turning us against each other.
[00:13:23.558 --> 00:13:24.499]  You have no hope.
[00:13:24.499 --> 00:13:26.140]  I have no hope of navigating this.
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.642]  So we have to come together and realize what's happening.
[00:13:28.642 --> 00:13:29.843]  Owen Shore is about to take over.
[00:13:29.843 --> 00:13:31.764]  Later I'm going to break down.
[00:13:31.764 --> 00:13:34.946]  Biden's saying open the borders, come in, rush the borders.
[00:13:34.946 --> 00:13:36.868]  Now he's saying, oh, there's not a border crisis.
[00:13:37.572 --> 00:13:39.494]  People are now seeing the warfare.
[00:13:39.494 --> 00:13:41.296]  They're seeing the country be dismantled.
[00:13:41.296 --> 00:13:43.058]  They're seeing the gas prices explode.
[00:13:43.058 --> 00:13:45.180]  They're seeing the XL Pipeline shut down.
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.201]  The Keystone Pipeline.
[00:13:46.201 --> 00:13:55.892]  They're seeing all of these attacks and realizing that when they make our military wear red high heels and all the rest of this, that it's designed to demoralize us and people are starting to really get it.
[00:13:55.892 --> 00:13:58.074]  The question is, will it be fast enough?
[00:13:59.238 --> 00:14:03.183]  We're fighting harder than ever at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, but we can't do it without your help.
[00:14:03.183 --> 00:14:05.485]  So please, as you do every day, you've done a great job.
[00:14:05.485 --> 00:14:11.472]  Tell folks about the local station you're listening to, or station you're watching, like your life depends on it because it does.
[00:14:11.472 --> 00:14:18.420]  Share the live links to the show, where we have medical doctors and scientists coming on, exposing that this isn't a vaccine, that it's a poison, especially mRNA.
[00:14:19.772 --> 00:14:26.757]  And realize that this is the fight that humanity has for the future, and that this is so real, and that what we've covered has been over the target.
[00:14:26.757 --> 00:14:35.223]  That's why we were the first to be banned, and are still the most banned, because the enemy understands that we've got the blueprint for their operation, and we know how to stop them.
[00:14:35.223 --> 00:14:35.984]  We have their playbook.
[00:14:36.344 --> 00:14:38.185]  So, again, Owen's about to take over.
[00:14:38.185 --> 00:14:48.688]  Also, please remember, we've got the big blowout sale going right now on a whole bunch of select items with free shipping and 50% off all the Emerix Essentials Alpha Power that is a great focus of nootropic.
[00:14:48.688 --> 00:14:54.611]  When I'm tired in the afternoon, need to keep working, I pop one of them, pop two of them, incredible five, six hours of clean focus energy.
[00:14:54.611 --> 00:14:54.871]  That's 50% off.
[00:14:56.311 --> 00:15:00.853]  We've got so many other great products at Infowarsstore.com and without you purchasing them, we will not be here.
[00:15:00.853 --> 00:15:06.135]  But thanks to you, we've been able to stay on the air despite the attacks and the tribulations and things that are going on.
[00:15:06.135 --> 00:15:09.516]  So I want to thank you all for your financial support and I want to thank you all for your word of mouth.
[00:15:09.516 --> 00:15:16.819]  I want to thank you all for your prayers because this is a group effort to win this fight and you are not people in the stands.
[00:15:16.819 --> 00:15:20.500]  You are men and women of every race, color, and creed in that arena.
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.121]  And I want to thank you all for keeping us
[00:15:23.107 --> 00:15:24.988]  In a position to continue on and fight.
[00:15:24.988 --> 00:15:25.508]  God bless.
[00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:28.269]  Owen Shorter takes over from the ATX.
[00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:29.190]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:35.032]  When we come back from this break, I'm going to be deliberating in the break, deciding where I want to go here.
[00:15:35.032 --> 00:15:38.974]  We've got political developments from the Democrat Party.
[00:15:38.974 --> 00:15:42.115]  We've got, well, a lot there to get to.
[00:15:42.805 --> 00:15:45.968]  We've also got some world developments.
[00:15:45.968 --> 00:15:56.159]  The world is destabilizing since Biden has been in, but then I've got a massive stack of COVID news with the fake pandemic that, quite frankly, mind-boggling, but this is where we're at.
[00:15:59.663 --> 00:16:05.367]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us.
[00:16:05.367 --> 00:16:12.212]  Not just tracking and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well.
[00:16:12.212 --> 00:16:13.873]  With or without a battery.
[00:16:14.645 --> 00:16:20.748]  Now, with the Infowars Privacy Pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[00:16:20.748 --> 00:16:21.609]  Excellent.
[00:16:21.609 --> 00:16:27.192]  Now I have my own compact Faraday cage I can take wherever I want.
[00:16:27.192 --> 00:16:30.213]  And you can too, at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:16:31.794 --> 00:16:42.565]  Government agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now contact tracers are all tracking your every move through your mobile phone.
[00:16:42.565 --> 00:16:47.489]  Now you can have the power to easily cut them off and go dark.

[00:16:53.395 --> 00:16:54.476]  InfoWarStore.com

[00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:17.639]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:18.860]  You found it.
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.261]  The tip of the spear.
[00:18:20.261 --> 00:18:25.664]  It is The Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[00:18:27.771 --> 00:18:37.518]  You know, every once in a while, there's a story or a development that shows the fraud of the entire system.
[00:18:37.518 --> 00:18:43.042]  And really, there's a couple going right now with COVID and the border crisis.
[00:18:43.042 --> 00:18:50.828]  But I want to focus on the border crisis now, and then I'll try to get to all this COVID nonsense in the next segment.
[00:18:50.828 --> 00:18:56.492]  But it's really incredible what's happening at the southern border and
[00:18:57.535 --> 00:19:04.782]  What it exposes is the lies and the fraud and the deception of the current administration, the Biden administration.
[00:19:04.782 --> 00:19:20.338]  It exposes the agenda that is afoot to destabilize and collapse the United States of America with the invasion at the southern border, economic warfare, demographic replacement.
[00:19:21.621 --> 00:19:22.982]  It's all by design.
[00:19:22.982 --> 00:19:31.685]  And now you have Biden, uh, border crisis by design warns ex-ICE chief.
[00:19:31.685 --> 00:19:33.085]  Yeah.
[00:19:33.085 --> 00:19:34.006]  You don't say.
[00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:42.289]  And then last night, people are watching Mark Levin on Fox talking about Cloward and Piven.
[00:19:42.289 --> 00:19:47.871]  And so people are messaging me, hey, look, Fox is talking about Cloward and Piven, the stuff InfoWars talked about 10 years ago!
[00:19:50.836 --> 00:19:53.377]  So good for Mark Levin!
[00:19:53.377 --> 00:19:57.279]  The border has been a disaster for decades.
[00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:59.580]  Nobody wants to talk about it.
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:05.262]  So the story of the southern border proves the Biden administration is lying and deceiving.
[00:20:05.262 --> 00:20:16.107]  There is an agenda to collapse the southern border, collapse the United States of America, and the media for the most part is covering it up.
[00:20:16.107 --> 00:20:19.308]  The media for the most part is covering it up.
[00:20:22.563 --> 00:20:49.051]  And so, when you have a Democrat from Texas, and I actually think this was by design, a Democrat from Texas goes to the southern border, and then they release the first known images from the kids in cages detention centers since the Biden administration began, because the Biden administration is not allowing media in there.
[00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:55.814]  But, so a Democrat gets in there and releases the photos.
[00:20:55.814 --> 00:21:01.799]  But of course, this is right before Project Veritas does the same thing.
[00:21:01.799 --> 00:21:08.305]  Guys, if you want to roll... In fact, let's go to this Project Veritas two-minute clip here.
[00:21:08.305 --> 00:21:14.550]  Project Veritas obtains never-before-seen images from inside a Texas detention facility.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:23.703]  Project Veritas has obtained never-before-seen photographs of what it actually looks like inside this facility.
[00:21:23.703 --> 00:21:32.006]  Shocking images showing people wrapped up in what looks like metal foil, laying on the ground, their faces covered.
[00:21:32.666 --> 00:21:35.088]  Why won't the administration be honest about this?
[00:21:35.088 --> 00:21:37.490]  Why won't they show you these images?
[00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:38.871]  I'm on the ground in Donna, Texas.
[00:21:38.871 --> 00:21:45.036]  If you want to take a look at this facility right here, just a month ago, Customs and Border Patrol agents completed the construction of that facility.
[00:21:45.036 --> 00:21:47.378]  It's a 165,000 square foot facility.
[00:21:47.378 --> 00:21:51.601]  And we have never seen images inside this facility before.
[00:21:51.601 --> 00:21:58.427]  They won't even allow the non-profit lawyers who conduct the actual oversight of these immigration detention centers to go inside.
[00:21:58.427 --> 00:22:00.068]  We have a man who's telling us to leave.
[00:22:00.068 --> 00:22:00.769]  Where were the press?
[00:22:04.548 --> 00:22:07.849]  They told us it's private property, but you know what isn't private property?
[00:22:07.849 --> 00:22:08.849]  Airspace!
[00:22:08.849 --> 00:22:14.430]  We're going to fly this Cirrus right over the top of the detention center to get a better look.
[00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:15.570]  There's the facility right there.
[00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:16.630]  You can see it.
[00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:17.690]  There it is.
[00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:19.811]  We're flying over the facility to give you a better look.
[00:22:19.811 --> 00:22:20.691]  Look at that massive facility.
[00:22:20.691 --> 00:22:26.212]  During a recent press conference, the press secretary was asked the question why they haven't released these images.
[00:22:26.212 --> 00:22:30.533]  Even you haven't released any images that you obviously could redact if you wanted to.
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:39.245]  Again, we remain committed to sharing with all of you the... She dodged the question, saying, quote... And we remain committed to transparency.
[00:22:39.245 --> 00:22:41.047]  I don't have an update for you on the timeline.
[00:22:41.047 --> 00:22:41.807]  End quote.
[00:22:41.807 --> 00:22:48.431]  Well, Press Secretary of the White House, let Project Veritas do your job for you.
[00:22:48.431 --> 00:22:53.475]  Just last night, we have now obtained these photos inside this facility.
[00:22:54.895 --> 00:22:57.137]  Now these photos are very, very grim.
[00:22:57.137 --> 00:23:02.261]  Project Veritas has also learned these photographs were taken in the last few days.
[00:23:02.261 --> 00:23:06.404]  There are eight pods with eight cells in each facility.
[00:23:06.404 --> 00:23:11.909]  At any given moment, there are an average of 3,000 people in custody inside this detention center.
[00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:14.671]  Pod has eight cells that are currently holding
[00:23:15.391 --> 00:23:21.098]  600, that's 600 unaccompanied juvenile males aged 7 to 17.
[00:23:21.098 --> 00:23:24.142]  They were separated by age or physical size depending on the room.
[00:23:24.142 --> 00:23:27.946]  15 of the individuals inside this facility were COVID positive.
[00:23:27.946 --> 00:23:32.672]  There have been multiple sexual assaults, normal assaults, and daily medical emergencies.
[00:23:34.528 --> 00:23:49.571]  Now think about how sick it is that this is all part of a global destabilization agenda, specifically to destabilize the United States of America, and these poor people are being used for that force.
[00:23:49.571 --> 00:23:57.052]  So yeah, they get told, hey, come into America, you'll get everything for free, you'll get a bunch of money, come on in, the border's open.
[00:23:57.052 --> 00:24:00.113]  And then there's actual border patrol and people that are like, hey, what the hell's going on here?
[00:24:01.204 --> 00:24:03.965]  And so the Biden administration kind of has to capitulate a little bit.
[00:24:03.965 --> 00:24:08.986]  They can't just be like, hey, we're allowing an invasion to happen, even though that's what they are doing effectively.
[00:24:08.986 --> 00:24:15.808]  So they build new facilities and they put tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people, stacked them up like sardines in these things.
[00:24:15.808 --> 00:24:25.111]  Of course, after four years of complaining about what Trump was doing at the southern border, which was humane, which was common sense.
[00:24:25.111 --> 00:24:26.051]  But notice how
[00:24:28.203 --> 00:24:45.752]  They don't want the media in there, and so Project Veritas has to get leaked photos, and then I am a little suspicious because a Democrat released the photos, pretty much the exact photos that Project Veritas released, just mere hours before Project Veritas did it.
[00:24:45.752 --> 00:24:57.298]  So it's almost like the Democrats knew Project Veritas was about to leak that story, so they let their candidate leak the images first, saying, here's what's going on, it's under control, all this stuff to try to control the narrative.
[00:24:57.978 --> 00:25:00.841]  So, I mean, this is the stuff that goes on behind the scenes, folks.
[00:25:00.841 --> 00:25:16.157]  Believe me, they would not have had their own Democrat from Texas, his office, I forget the individual's name, publish all the photos that, it's basically the exact same photos published by Project Veritas, just hours before Project Veritas did it to control the narrative.
[00:25:17.515 --> 00:25:23.196]  So that's the level of warfare right now, information warfare, happening at the southern border.
[00:25:23.196 --> 00:25:24.156]  What is the agenda?
[00:25:24.156 --> 00:25:25.357]  What is going on?
[00:25:25.357 --> 00:25:29.918]  They show up wearing Biden shirts, they talk to media, they say, we came here because of Biden.
[00:25:29.918 --> 00:25:35.279]  You ask the Biden administration what's going on, they tell you, nothing to see here.
[00:25:35.279 --> 00:25:40.320]  It was Henry Quaylar, thank you, the Texas Democrat.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:44.601]  Just, just before Project Veritas released their photos, oh,
[00:25:47.082 --> 00:25:51.043]  But hey, even these Democrats in Texas are like, what the hell are you doing here?
[00:25:51.043 --> 00:25:52.344]  We have a wide open border.
[00:25:52.344 --> 00:25:53.524]  They're coming in with COVID.
[00:25:53.524 --> 00:25:58.365]  I thought there was a pandemic.
[00:25:58.365 --> 00:26:06.968]  So, imagine though, imagine how dastardly these people are to lie and say, oh, come in here.
[00:26:06.968 --> 00:26:09.328]  Of course, they try to give them as much as they can.
[00:26:09.328 --> 00:26:10.489]  They give them hotels.
[00:26:10.489 --> 00:26:14.350]  In fact, the Biden administration has
[00:26:16.309 --> 00:26:21.974]  Earmarked 86 million dollars to purchase hotel rooms.
[00:26:21.974 --> 00:26:25.917]  They claim for 1,200 illegal immigrants.
[00:26:25.917 --> 00:26:32.282]  That's $395 a night for illegal immigrants to stay in a hotel.
[00:26:32.282 --> 00:26:34.564]  That's a pretty nice hotel.
[00:26:34.564 --> 00:26:37.086]  That's a pretty nice chunk of change.
[00:26:37.086 --> 00:26:38.948]  You don't get that benefit.
[00:26:38.948 --> 00:26:42.010]  Why are they doing it for non-citizens?
[00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:43.091]  It's all part of an agenda.
[00:26:43.863 --> 00:26:45.364]  It's all part of an agenda.
[00:26:45.364 --> 00:26:46.745]  And where's Biden?
[00:26:46.745 --> 00:26:48.926]  Well, he says at some point he'll visit the border.
[00:26:48.926 --> 00:26:50.567]  Oh, at some point.
[00:26:50.567 --> 00:26:51.507]  At some point.
[00:26:51.507 --> 00:26:56.750]  That point, probably never going to come.
[00:26:56.750 --> 00:27:04.074]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and the worses of that.
[00:27:04.074 --> 00:27:07.375]  If you're paying attention, you know we've done together.
[00:27:07.375 --> 00:27:08.136]  But I'll tell you this.
[00:27:09.674 --> 00:27:17.340]  The technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.742]  They're trying to shudder and silence the human resistance.
[00:27:19.742 --> 00:27:25.346]  So, now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[00:27:25.346 --> 00:27:28.508]  Everything you warned your friends and family about is about to be true.
[00:27:28.508 --> 00:27:31.290]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:34.573]  The power structures are going to silence those of us that they can.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:40.266]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[00:27:40.266 --> 00:27:41.968]  We have the power.
[00:27:41.968 --> 00:27:46.293]  But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[00:27:46.293 --> 00:27:51.840]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.022]  So be the polar bears you are.
[00:27:57.819 --> 00:28:06.065]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand that this is all a test.
[00:28:06.065 --> 00:28:12.089]  This experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning.
[00:28:12.089 --> 00:28:20.975]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension so we can decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to.
[00:28:20.975 --> 00:28:22.196]  And it really does come down to that.
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:30.807]  As sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[00:28:30.807 --> 00:28:34.430]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:36.632]  God is the author of us having free will.
[00:28:37.367 --> 00:28:39.989]  And that free will is a beautiful thing.
[00:28:39.989 --> 00:28:44.973]  And when you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture, in Washington D.C.
[00:28:44.973 --> 00:28:50.056]  and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[00:28:50.056 --> 00:28:52.858]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the bad.
[00:28:52.858 --> 00:28:57.361]  Because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[00:28:57.361 --> 00:29:00.984]  It's so hard for me when I'm cutting ads to not get overly excited.
[00:29:02.228 --> 00:29:04.269]  People ask me all the time, they go, Jones, are you on cocaine?
[00:29:04.269 --> 00:29:05.349]  Are you on meth?
[00:29:05.349 --> 00:29:06.730]  How are you so excited?
[00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:15.533]  How do I not get excited about world government, forced masks, forced inoculations, open announcements that our country is going to be dissolved?
[00:29:15.533 --> 00:29:16.794]  I'm sorry.
[00:29:16.794 --> 00:29:17.894]  I'm a fighter.
[00:29:17.894 --> 00:29:20.615]  And I know many of you out there watching and listening are fighters as well.
[00:29:20.615 --> 00:29:22.776]  And so I'll just say this.
[00:29:22.776 --> 00:29:23.796]  I try to be calm.
[00:29:23.796 --> 00:29:25.557]  I try to be focused.
[00:29:25.557 --> 00:29:27.758]  I don't know what I'd do if I wasn't still on air right now.
[00:29:29.304 --> 00:29:32.745]  But I just really want to thank you for keeping us on air.
[00:29:32.745 --> 00:29:37.847]  Because you have to realize, when I tell you that you're the InfoWar, that's not me patting you on the head.
[00:29:37.847 --> 00:29:41.568]  You are 99% of the equation.
[00:29:41.568 --> 00:29:49.330]  So when you decide to spread the word, when you decide to buy the products at InfoWarStore.com, when you decide to share the articles and videos we produce, it changes the world.
[00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:51.531]  So, you are the InfoWar.
[00:29:51.531 --> 00:29:53.152]  Thank you so much for the fight.
[00:29:53.152 --> 00:29:54.432]  Thank you for all you've done.
[00:29:54.432 --> 00:29:56.853]  Now let's take action together and take down the Globalist.
[00:29:58.493 --> 00:30:13.207]  The entire New World Order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[00:30:13.867 --> 00:30:22.052]  Being given free will, being given consciousness, is literally the seed of an entire universe, an entire system.
[00:30:22.052 --> 00:30:38.701]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're able to see the beauty of a sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty of your wife or your husband, or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music, the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic.
[00:30:38.701 --> 00:30:42.143]  And that itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[00:30:42.743 --> 00:30:51.129]  So don't worship the globalists, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things of the system, but worship the things of God, because we're made by God.
[00:30:51.129 --> 00:30:59.936]  And appreciate your consciousness, and appreciate free speech, while you still have it, while you still have it.
[00:30:59.936 --> 00:31:02.538]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:31:16.844 --> 00:31:44.377]  You know, it's really incredible to be living in these times, the most insane times, perhaps, at least in recent history, for sure, where you have a totally defunct president, an open agenda to destroy the country, the United States of America, at the root of it, the core of it, is in the White House, supposed to be leading the country, and it's at the charge, leading to destroy the country.
[00:31:44.377 --> 00:31:44.857]  And then again,
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:54.428]  The national emergency at the southern border is just so illustrative of so many things.
[00:31:54.428 --> 00:32:07.459]  The fraud of the media, the fraud of the Democrat Party, the lies of the Biden administration, the agenda to collapse the country, the false COVID fear, the false fear of viruses.
[00:32:07.459 --> 00:32:10.122]  All of it exposed in one story at the southern border.
[00:32:12.771 --> 00:32:20.496]  And so I just sit here and it's like, here's the skeleton key to understanding the lies of the media, the lies of the politicians, the agenda to destroy America.
[00:32:20.496 --> 00:32:22.217]  Wide open southern border.
[00:32:22.217 --> 00:32:24.699]  Total common sense.
[00:32:24.699 --> 00:32:26.240]  Total common sense.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:31.823]  And they're so bold in their treason in the White House, they don't even care!
[00:32:31.823 --> 00:32:34.385]  Yeah, the border's wide open.
[00:32:34.385 --> 00:32:36.386]  Yeah, they come across wearing Biden shirts.
[00:32:36.386 --> 00:32:38.668]  Yeah, they talk to the media and say they came here for Biden.
[00:32:40.425 --> 00:32:50.572]  Yeah, it's a thousands percentage, thousands of percentage increase from the past year since Biden got in.
[00:32:50.572 --> 00:32:51.853]  And they just shrug their shoulders.
[00:32:51.853 --> 00:32:53.554]  They say there's nothing going on.
[00:32:53.554 --> 00:32:56.636]  It's no, it's just a narrative.
[00:32:56.636 --> 00:32:57.457]  No, it's happening.
[00:32:57.457 --> 00:32:58.317]  You can't hide it.
[00:32:58.317 --> 00:32:59.398]  You tried to hide it.
[00:32:59.398 --> 00:33:03.100]  You kept the media away from the southern border.
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:07.683]  But they just have to walk right down to the southern border and they'll catch people walking across illegally.
[00:33:07.683 --> 00:33:08.244]  They go talk to
[00:33:09.432 --> 00:33:10.973]  ICE, they go talk to Border Patrol.
[00:33:10.973 --> 00:33:12.734]  They go talk to the illegal immigrants coming.
[00:33:12.734 --> 00:33:13.574]  They all tell the story.
[00:33:13.574 --> 00:33:15.475]  They go, yeah, we came here for Biden.
[00:33:15.475 --> 00:33:17.956]  ICE leaders, Border Patrol leaders say, yeah, Biden is doing this.
[00:33:17.956 --> 00:33:18.816]  It's the Biden administration.
[00:33:18.816 --> 00:33:19.757]  They're collapsing our southern border.
[00:33:19.757 --> 00:33:20.597]  I don't know what he wants us to do.
[00:33:20.597 --> 00:33:22.578]  There's nothing we can do.
[00:33:22.578 --> 00:33:23.398]  They're bringing in drugs.
[00:33:23.398 --> 00:33:24.199]  They're bringing in guns.
[00:33:24.199 --> 00:33:25.439]  They're child sex trafficking.
[00:33:25.439 --> 00:33:26.300]  It's all of it.
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:30.922]  It's all because of the Biden administration.
[00:33:30.922 --> 00:33:33.843]  It's an invasion.
[00:33:33.843 --> 00:33:35.724]  I feel bad for these oppressed people.
[00:33:37.168 --> 00:33:44.531]  I'm sad that their ancestors couldn't build a country that wouldn't oppress them and would allow them to prosper.
[00:33:44.531 --> 00:33:49.092]  Central America is a beautiful place!
[00:33:49.092 --> 00:33:51.814]  But their ancestors didn't provide them that future.
[00:33:51.814 --> 00:33:59.796]  So let them fight for it in Central America instead of coming here to collapse the United States into the hellhole that they came from.
[00:33:59.796 --> 00:34:01.017]  But that's all by design.
[00:34:02.455 --> 00:34:04.517]  But of course the political elite don't care.
[00:34:04.517 --> 00:34:06.099]  It'll never impact them.
[00:34:06.099 --> 00:34:09.402]  It'll only enrich them.
[00:34:09.402 --> 00:34:15.448]  And then they just figure, hey, when we get absorbed by the world government, I'll have a seat at the table!
[00:34:15.448 --> 00:34:18.171]  They don't care about the eugenics that'll be run.
[00:34:18.171 --> 00:34:22.055]  On kids.
[00:34:22.055 --> 00:34:23.296]  So it's very frustrating
[00:34:27.361 --> 00:34:31.182]  That there's not more of an uproar nationwide about this.
[00:34:31.182 --> 00:34:33.742]  But you know, there is.
[00:34:33.742 --> 00:34:38.383]  It's just not being properly covered.
[00:34:38.383 --> 00:34:53.525]  And you know, it's kind of highlighted, I think, in the fact that Donald Trump will go on Fox News today and talk about the crisis at the southern border.
[00:34:53.525 --> 00:34:56.746]  But you know, see, that's actually the problem.
[00:35:00.405 --> 00:35:12.492]  There is an entire group of people organizing to be down there on Friday and there's a list of speakers, a lot of very popular people on the conservative movement.
[00:35:12.492 --> 00:35:13.812]  But see, here's the problem.
[00:35:13.812 --> 00:35:16.794]  All these people are considered alternative.
[00:35:16.794 --> 00:35:18.515]  So the mainstream news isn't interested in them.
[00:35:19.105 --> 00:35:21.547]  They're the ones that are actually sounding the alarm.
[00:35:21.547 --> 00:35:24.088]  They're the ones that get that there's an agenda afoot.
[00:35:24.088 --> 00:35:32.253]  Sure, Fox News will show you the southern border being wide open, and they'll show you the interviews of them saying it's, you know, they're coming here for Biden, and they'll talk about it.
[00:35:32.253 --> 00:35:35.975]  But they'll never mention that this is an agenda to destroy the United States of America.
[00:35:35.975 --> 00:35:42.819]  Again, no, Mark Levin has a guest on last night, former ICE captain, who says, yeah, this is an agenda to destroy the country.
[00:35:42.819 --> 00:35:44.701]  It's coming right out of the Biden White House.
[00:35:44.701 --> 00:35:48.603]  That should be like pressers, like nonstop around the clock.
[00:35:49.204 --> 00:35:52.445]  Border Patrol agents, ICE agents say Biden is destroying the country.
[00:35:52.445 --> 00:35:54.765]  And he is!
[00:35:54.765 --> 00:36:03.767]  It's kind of like the federal judge, the district court judge, excuse me, that came out and said the Democrats control the media, the Democrats control Hollywood, it's dangerous.
[00:36:03.767 --> 00:36:09.768]  And he made the decision of the New York Times versus Sullivan, he wants it reversed because he sees the danger now that the Democrats control all the media.
[00:36:09.768 --> 00:36:13.108]  And they rig elections.
[00:36:13.108 --> 00:36:15.949]  And they cause racial strife and warfare.
[00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:18.431]  Story just got published.
[00:36:18.431 --> 00:36:25.116]  12-year-old boy hacked to death by a black man that was screaming death to white devils.
[00:36:25.116 --> 00:36:26.937]  Will Don Lemon feel responsible for that?
[00:36:26.937 --> 00:36:39.266]  Will CNN and MSNBC and the rest of the race-baiting pimps, pimps for race war, will they feel bad about another white boy murdered by a black man because of their rhetoric?
[00:36:39.266 --> 00:36:40.927]  Will they ever feel any remorse?
[00:36:40.927 --> 00:36:41.588]  No!
[00:36:41.588 --> 00:36:42.909]  They love it!
[00:36:42.909 --> 00:36:44.250]  It's what they want!
[00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:45.611]  It's what gets them off!
[00:36:47.395 --> 00:36:54.677]  When they promote racial violence, when they promote race war in this country, what do you think they want?
[00:36:54.677 --> 00:36:56.198]  They want Whitey dead!
[00:36:56.198 --> 00:36:58.239]  They want the black guy to kill Whitey!
[00:36:58.239 --> 00:37:01.980]  When they promote open borders, what do you think they want?
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.880]  They want an invasion!
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:07.341]  They want America to collapse!
[00:37:07.341 --> 00:37:10.642]  This should be common knowledge, this should be understood by everyone.
[00:37:10.642 --> 00:37:12.903]  But you see, here's my point.
[00:37:12.903 --> 00:37:15.164]  So Trump goes on Fox News today,
[00:37:16.149 --> 00:37:28.398]  Who promoted the steal of the election, who called Arizona first for Biden, who was anti-Trump in 2016, and was anti-Trump about 50% for 2020.
[00:37:28.398 --> 00:37:31.420]  But then Trump goes on Fox News!
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:35.123]  Trump doesn't come on InfoWars that promoted him and helped get him in the office.
[00:37:35.123 --> 00:37:42.348]  Trump doesn't go on the other alternative news networks that still have his back, that get banned and censored everywhere.
[00:37:42.348 --> 00:37:44.390]  But he goes on the milquetoast Fox News.
[00:37:46.457 --> 00:37:49.659]  Fox News won't promote this event coming up on Friday.
[00:37:49.659 --> 00:37:52.160]  You probably can't even find it anywhere.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:53.361]  It's banned everywhere.
[00:37:53.361 --> 00:37:55.903]  All the people that are organizing it are banned everywhere.
[00:37:55.903 --> 00:37:57.503]  They can't promote it, they get banned.
[00:37:57.503 --> 00:37:59.525]  They can't post flyers, they get banned.
[00:37:59.525 --> 00:38:02.506]  So it's literally just word of mouth.
[00:38:02.506 --> 00:38:05.448]  And there'll still be thousands of people that show up.
[00:38:05.448 --> 00:38:07.969]  But see, oh, don't promote that.
[00:38:07.969 --> 00:38:10.251]  No, go promote Fox News.
[00:38:10.251 --> 00:38:15.674]  That'll gladly participate in the theft of the 2020 election from you, Donald Trump.
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:22.564]  Go promote Fox News that did everything they possibly could to keep you out of office in 2016.
[00:38:22.564 --> 00:38:30.849]  Yeah, go on with Fox News and continue to ignore the people that are actually fighting for this country.
[00:38:30.849 --> 00:38:34.371]  So that's just a microcosm of the problem.
[00:38:34.371 --> 00:38:43.097]  Mainstream conservatives and Republicans still don't get it because they're still watching Fox News.
[00:38:43.097 --> 00:38:43.377]  But see,
[00:38:44.053 --> 00:38:50.055]  What's happening at the southern border is so big, it's impossible to ignore.
[00:38:50.055 --> 00:38:55.297]  And I don't know how else to really explain it.
[00:38:55.297 --> 00:39:01.459]  The Biden administration is committing open treason against this country.
[00:39:01.459 --> 00:39:02.139]  By U.S.
[00:39:02.139 --> 00:39:09.602]  code, if I get caught smuggling someone across the southern border, I just committed a crime.
[00:39:09.602 --> 00:39:10.622]  That's aiding and abetting.
[00:39:11.323 --> 00:39:17.046]  But when the Biden administration does it, that's just okay.
[00:39:17.046 --> 00:39:20.128]  They want you to panic about some fake pandemic for COVID.
[00:39:20.128 --> 00:39:20.749]  Really?
[00:39:20.749 --> 00:39:27.813]  You're letting thousands, tens of thousands of people into this country that have tested positive for COVID and releasing them into the streets.
[00:39:27.813 --> 00:39:30.014]  How much do you really care about COVID?
[00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:34.191]  Can you do basic math?
[00:39:34.191 --> 00:39:39.573]  If you have a welfare state and you have an open border, what does that equal?
[00:39:39.573 --> 00:39:43.035]  Well, that equals total bankruptcy!
[00:39:43.035 --> 00:39:50.838]  That means that you are now going to foot the bill for potentially six billion people on Earth!
[00:39:50.838 --> 00:39:52.618]  You want to come to the United States of America?
[00:39:52.618 --> 00:39:53.419]  Come on in!
[00:39:53.419 --> 00:39:58.921]  You get a hotel room, you get a bus ride, you get a plane ride, you get a helicopter ride, you get a meal card,
[00:39:59.833 --> 00:40:01.673]  You get to stay in a facility.
[00:40:01.673 --> 00:40:03.134]  Who do you think's paying for that?
[00:40:03.134 --> 00:40:09.875]  It's open treason.
[00:40:09.875 --> 00:40:13.835]  Aiding and abetting crime.
[00:40:13.835 --> 00:40:17.356]  That's what the Biden administration is doing when they stop the border construction.
[00:40:17.356 --> 00:40:20.556]  That's what the Biden administration is doing when they promote the open borders.
[00:40:20.556 --> 00:40:23.057]  Come here, we'll let you in, and we'll give you free stuff.
[00:40:23.057 --> 00:40:25.477]  That's open treason.
[00:40:25.477 --> 00:40:26.537]  You don't want to go that far?
[00:40:26.537 --> 00:40:29.558]  At the very least, it's aiding and abetting criminal activity.
[00:40:30.751 --> 00:40:34.854]  But what do you expect from criminals?
[00:40:34.854 --> 00:40:37.917]  Oh, but don't expect Biden to answer a question.
[00:40:37.917 --> 00:40:40.479]  Biden doesn't know where he is half the time.
[00:40:40.479 --> 00:40:42.580]  Biden can't do a press conference.
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.482]  Biden can't climb stairs.
[00:40:44.482 --> 00:40:46.023]  Biden can't walk.
[00:40:46.023 --> 00:40:47.544]  Biden can't talk.
[00:40:47.544 --> 00:40:48.645]  Biden can't think.
[00:40:51.224 --> 00:40:54.085]  So it's kind of a big deal, a national emergency.
[00:40:54.085 --> 00:40:56.526]  We have a president that can't think, and we have a wide-open Southern Board.
[00:40:56.526 --> 00:41:04.349]  Emmerich's Essentials is all-natural, all-organic, high-end, quality, clean, self-care products.
[00:41:04.349 --> 00:41:08.290]  And they are 50% off right now at Impowar store.
[00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:12.071]  Free shipping for a limited time.
[00:41:12.071 --> 00:41:17.172]  That is the three essential oil all-natural hand sanitizers.
[00:41:17.172 --> 00:41:25.374]  That's all of these high-end super pure quality essential oils and basically every popular scent that's out there.
[00:41:25.374 --> 00:41:28.494]  Then of course we have the natural shampoo, organic.
[00:41:28.494 --> 00:41:29.975]  We also have the body wash.
[00:41:29.975 --> 00:41:35.136]  It's all there and our best-selling organic deodorant from Enrich's Acid.
[00:41:35.236 --> 00:41:36.076]  We're good to go.
[00:41:56.306 --> 00:42:01.970]  The New World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world government.
[00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:05.232]  But world government is only the control grid.
[00:42:05.232 --> 00:42:12.777]  Now, inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods and attain immortality.
[00:42:12.777 --> 00:42:19.802]  But the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon-based life forms.
[00:42:19.802 --> 00:42:22.044]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[00:42:22.044 --> 00:42:25.246]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[00:42:25.766 --> 00:42:27.647]  They are playing God.
[00:42:27.647 --> 00:42:37.512]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology to carry out this transformation.
[00:42:37.512 --> 00:42:42.814]  I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings of the globalists, it's all on record.
[00:42:42.814 --> 00:42:43.935]  You have been warned.
[00:42:45.275 --> 00:42:49.698]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[00:42:49.698 --> 00:42:53.300]  This is the end of all life on Earth as we know it.
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:57.402]  This is the alien takeover of Earth.
[00:42:57.402 --> 00:43:01.344]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[00:43:01.344 --> 00:43:03.966]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodine?
[00:43:03.966 --> 00:43:04.726]  Why do you do that?
[00:43:04.726 --> 00:43:07.668]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[00:43:07.668 --> 00:43:09.689]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey,
[00:43:10.478 --> 00:43:18.615]  A lot of people love Deep Earth Pure Crystal Iodine, but you should put one out with Deep Earth Crystal Iodine and the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[00:43:19.253 --> 00:43:19.513]  Boom!
[00:43:19.513 --> 00:43:19.894]  We did it.
[00:43:19.894 --> 00:43:20.414]  It's popular.
[00:43:20.414 --> 00:43:21.175]  It's X3.
[00:43:21.175 --> 00:43:22.416]  Is it better than X2?
[00:43:22.416 --> 00:43:23.076]  You decide.
[00:43:23.076 --> 00:43:24.557]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[00:43:24.557 --> 00:43:30.302]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular Powdered Pill Sleep Aid.
[00:43:30.302 --> 00:43:31.743]  And that is down and out.
[00:43:31.743 --> 00:43:33.004]  It's super strong.
[00:43:33.004 --> 00:43:34.885]  Way stronger than knockout.
[00:43:34.885 --> 00:43:36.446]  But they don't compete with each other.
[00:43:36.446 --> 00:43:38.328]  Different strokes for different folks.
[00:43:38.328 --> 00:43:39.128]  Different formulas.

[00:43:48.015 --> 00:43:48.475]  Down and out.
[00:43:48.475 --> 00:43:57.722]  Exclusively available at InfoWareStore.com for 40% off and free shipping.
[00:43:57.722 --> 00:43:59.244]  The people are awakening.
[00:43:59.244 --> 00:44:01.966]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[00:44:01.966 --> 00:44:04.027]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[00:44:04.027 --> 00:44:06.369]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's hand-held.
[00:44:06.369 --> 00:44:14.655]  But, big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai Comps especially, are using this to steal your data.
[00:44:14.655 --> 00:44:15.796]  To share your data.
[00:44:15.996 --> 00:44:24.625]  To be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data, they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[00:44:24.625 --> 00:44:31.312]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[00:44:31.312 --> 00:44:32.753]  In their own words, they admit it.
[00:44:32.753 --> 00:44:37.218]  So, I've been selling privacy pouches and locket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[00:44:37.638 --> 00:44:39.579]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[00:44:39.579 --> 00:44:40.659]  They're Faraday cages.
[00:44:40.659 --> 00:44:42.360]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:44.361]  They work absolutely great.
[00:44:44.361 --> 00:44:53.244]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother to know what you're up to because it's none of their business.
[00:44:53.244 --> 00:45:00.907]  Get yours at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[00:45:00.907 --> 00:45:03.528]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:19.622]  Tonight, that you and President Obama made a mistake about deportations, why should Latinos trust you?
[00:45:19.622 --> 00:45:24.263]  What I would do as president is several more things, because things have changed.
[00:45:24.263 --> 00:45:29.304]  I would in fact make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[00:45:29.304 --> 00:45:31.205]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[00:45:31.205 --> 00:45:32.265]  They deserve to be heard.
[00:45:32.265 --> 00:45:33.045]  That's who we are.
[00:45:33.045 --> 00:45:37.266]  We're a nation that says if you want to flee, and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.
[00:45:37.266 --> 00:45:40.867]  A lot of the migrants coming in saying they're coming in because you promised
[00:45:41.481 --> 00:45:43.072]  To make things better.
[00:45:43.072 --> 00:45:44.200]  It seems to be getting worse.
[00:45:45.024 --> 00:45:45.925]  By the day.
[00:45:45.925 --> 00:45:48.506]  Was it a mistake not to anticipate this surge?
[00:45:48.506 --> 00:45:53.910]  Well, first of all, there was a surge the last two years in 19 and 20.
[00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:55.651]  There was a surge as well.
[00:45:55.651 --> 00:45:56.712]  This one might be worse.
[00:45:56.712 --> 00:45:57.752]  No, well, it could be.
[00:45:57.752 --> 00:45:58.953]  But here's the deal.
[00:45:58.953 --> 00:46:11.081]  We're sending back people to, first of all, the idea that Joe Biden said come because I heard the other day that they're coming because they know I'm a nice guy and I won't do this.
[00:46:11.081 --> 00:46:11.721]  Yeah.
[00:46:11.721 --> 00:46:12.442]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:46:12.982 --> 00:46:13.883]  They're not.
[00:46:13.883 --> 00:46:16.845]  Do you have to say quite clearly, don't come?
[00:46:16.845 --> 00:46:19.087]  Yes, I can say quite clearly, don't come.
[00:46:19.087 --> 00:46:25.011]  And what we're in the process of getting set up, don't leave your town or city or community.
[00:46:25.011 --> 00:46:28.233]  The chickens are coming home to roost.
[00:46:28.233 --> 00:46:34.458]  You know, I can say that America is having buyer's remorse with Joe Biden, but he didn't win this election.
[00:46:34.458 --> 00:46:40.502]  In fact, I was just talking to one of the top cybersecurity experts in the United States just two nights ago.
[00:46:41.272 --> 00:46:56.440]  And he's not ready to go public yet, but he's seriously considering going public and laying out the statistical fact that in the middle of the night, at least five states, you saw those spikes for Joe Biden, and that it was massive, concerted election fraud.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:47:00.662]  He's basically found what all the other experts have found as well, but that's a separate issue.
[00:47:00.662 --> 00:47:04.144]  People aren't getting buyer's remorse because they didn't vote for Joe Biden.
[00:47:04.144 --> 00:47:06.745]  This was the biggest case of fraud this country's ever seen, and now,
[00:47:07.549 --> 00:47:26.510]  The fraud of Biden falling down the stairs three times, the fraud of him not knowing who his granddaughter is or who his niece is, the fraud of him not knowing who the Secretary of Defense is or female generals that he's promoting are when they're right there with him on the podium shows that this puppet
[00:47:27.449 --> 00:47:33.670]  Has basically gone way past its expiration date and is causing a huge crisis.
[00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:39.452]  They always plan to replace him down the road with Kamala Harris or somebody else, like Nancy Pelosi.
[00:47:39.452 --> 00:47:41.712]  She said, I can become president.
[00:47:41.712 --> 00:47:50.034]  But now, with him in office just two months, two months, I guess yesterday to the day, the whole country is in crisis.
[00:47:50.034 --> 00:47:50.494]  And as
[00:47:52.009 --> 00:47:58.534]  John Bowne in one of his videos on Infowars.com yesterday said, Joe Biden is the crisis.
[00:47:58.534 --> 00:48:00.555]  We have nuclear weapons.
[00:48:00.555 --> 00:48:01.756]  We have all these nuclear reactors.
[00:48:01.756 --> 00:48:07.520]  We have all these complex systems that if we don't have competent people running things, things will fall apart.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.102]  Why do you think third world nations can't make it?
[00:48:10.102 --> 00:48:14.025]  Because they get corrupt political elites in charge of them.
[00:48:14.025 --> 00:48:16.447]  And then those corrupt political elites are above the law.
[00:48:16.447 --> 00:48:19.029]  They engage in election fraud, or they set up a dictatorship.
[00:48:19.759 --> 00:48:29.823]  And then there's never a way for any of the corruption or the ineptitude or for any of the ways for their bad management to be set right.
[00:48:29.823 --> 00:48:32.344]  And so America has gone over the edge of a cliff.
[00:48:32.344 --> 00:48:43.489]  And as I predicted over a year ago, when you turn off the world economy completely for six months, partially for over a year, that causes collapse in the first world.
[00:48:43.489 --> 00:48:46.970]  But while the average yuppie is at home watching Netflix, getting
[00:48:47.865 --> 00:48:48.325]  I don't know.
[00:49:05.936 --> 00:49:08.478]  Of all people, Bill Maher understands.
[00:49:08.478 --> 00:49:27.115]  I don't like Bill Maher's leftist policies, his pro-abortion stuff, but Bill Maher sounds as good as Tucker Carlson right now, and you notice he's being criticized by the left as well for caring about the country, and saying, well, politics is destroying us, and saying that China has a completely masculine military, and that puts people in death camps.
[00:49:27.859 --> 00:49:32.961]  But then here in the United States we're criticized and we're saying that white people are inherently evil and racist.
[00:49:32.961 --> 00:49:36.883]  This is all a smokescreen for the corruption of big tech and for China and for others.
[00:49:36.883 --> 00:49:47.467]  This whole Asia thing you see now where Asians are being targeted, Asians are being murdered by white people, that's a smokescreen for the real crime wave we know going on against Asians.
[00:49:48.087 --> 00:50:01.242]  The New York Times has an article wanting to ban 4chan and wanting to ban Telegram because people shared some Asian joke memes on there claiming that's why this incel sex pervert went and killed these innocent Asian women.
[00:50:01.242 --> 00:50:07.529]  Well, if you went to WorldStarHipHop or any of those big sites, all they're doing is playing knockout game with Asians.
[00:50:07.529 --> 00:50:09.111]  Should they shut down WorldStarHipHop?
[00:50:09.111 --> 00:50:09.231]  No.
[00:50:10.111 --> 00:50:20.283]  But we shouldn't sit there and then blame other platforms that have posted things one one millionth as bad and then say that it's all white on Asian crime spree.
[00:50:20.283 --> 00:50:24.729]  If you look at FBI statistics that just came out a few days ago, it shows that it is a total myth.
[00:50:25.242 --> 00:50:27.503]  That there is a white-on-Asian crime wave.
[00:50:27.503 --> 00:50:30.004]  In fact, it's one of the rarest forms of crime.
[00:50:30.004 --> 00:50:32.925]  The major crime wave is black-on-Asians.
[00:50:32.925 --> 00:50:42.548]  That's the way it's been for at least 30 years in this country because Asians moved into those poor neighborhoods and set up grocery stores and laundries and businesses and there's a lot of resentment.
[00:50:43.214 --> 00:50:44.494]  And there's issues on both sides.
[00:50:44.494 --> 00:50:47.295]  But the Asians don't deserve what's happening to them.
[00:50:47.295 --> 00:50:50.635]  The vast majority of black folks aren't attacking Asian businesses.
[00:50:50.635 --> 00:50:55.536]  It is a known stereotype that there is major friction between blacks and Asians.
[00:50:55.536 --> 00:51:10.779]  And so to sit there and try to act like it's white people doing it, out of 350 million Americans, another 40 million illegals that are here, 50 million, to say that because a crazy dude went and killed these poor sex workers, that now that's a white-owned Asian thing, it's preposterous.
[00:51:10.779 --> 00:51:11.099]  And it's to
[00:51:12.441 --> 00:51:16.044]  Divert away from the real sex crimes that are taking place on our border.
[00:51:16.044 --> 00:51:20.186]  Under Obama, tens of thousands of children were placed with smugglers.
[00:51:20.186 --> 00:51:22.668]  We're just allowed to come in and place with smugglers.
[00:51:22.668 --> 00:51:24.069]  And many of them ended up in the sex trade.
[00:51:24.069 --> 00:51:24.970]  Many ended up dead.
[00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:27.531]  That was in a Senate report five years ago.
[00:51:27.531 --> 00:51:34.816]  So you had Joe Biden going back just, I don't know, six months ago during the election, five months ago.
[00:51:34.816 --> 00:51:40.460]  And he said, if I get elected, you need to surge the border because I'm going to legalize you.
[00:51:41.289 --> 00:51:42.449]  And he said it several times.
[00:51:42.449 --> 00:51:44.290]  So that was a clear directive.
[00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:51.932]  These people show up in Biden shirts by the thousands, organized by the UN, organized by the Democratic Party, organized by George Soros.
[00:51:51.932 --> 00:51:54.693]  It's the same stuff they were doing a few years ago, but Trump blocked it.
[00:51:54.693 --> 00:52:03.976]  So we had record low illegal immigration because Trump said, we're going to deport you back to the country that you first came from or back to the nearest nation to be deported from there.
[00:52:03.976 --> 00:52:08.058]  And he put pressure on Guatemala and Mexico and a bunch of the countries where they wouldn't get $500 million a year.
[00:52:09.478 --> 00:52:14.742]  Or a billion dollars a year, depending on the country, that we were giving them an aid if they didn't start doing that.
[00:52:14.742 --> 00:52:16.744]  And so we saw law and order.
[00:52:16.744 --> 00:52:18.765]  And so this is children being smuggled.
[00:52:18.765 --> 00:52:28.773]  And we saw Psaki last week saying, if you have a 10-year-old with you or younger, it's a get-into-the-country free card.
[00:52:28.773 --> 00:52:29.614]  And she smiled about it.
[00:52:29.614 --> 00:52:30.615]  She's a monster.
[00:52:30.615 --> 00:52:34.498]  Knowing that all over Latin America, they're kidnapping children out of their backyards.
[00:52:35.544 --> 00:52:38.305]  Or out of the backs of school buses, you name it, it's happening.
[00:52:38.305 --> 00:52:43.966]  And they're being taken by smugglers up and then sold to the coyotes.
[00:52:43.966 --> 00:52:48.248]  And for Democrats, that doesn't mean a smaller wolf species.
[00:52:48.248 --> 00:52:49.048]  They're called coyotes.
[00:52:49.048 --> 00:52:50.408]  Those are the human smugglers.
[00:52:50.408 --> 00:52:55.510]  And then some children, they've confirmed, have been across and back over 30 times.
[00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:56.690]  Many of them are found dead.
[00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:58.651]  Some were as young as two years of age.
[00:52:58.651 --> 00:53:02.272]  And so they are using these children as they get into the country free card.
[00:53:02.272 --> 00:53:03.192]  And this is evil.
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:12.806]  And so, again, it's not buyer's remorse because America didn't vote for this guy, but for the people that went along with it, for the mainstream media that went along with it, they are seeing the American people totally turn against them.
[00:53:12.806 --> 00:53:15.328]  Because sure, they may be able to steal the next election because of H.R.
[00:53:15.328 --> 00:53:16.409]  1 if that goes through.
[00:53:16.409 --> 00:53:22.053]  They may be able to keep their fraud going, but what are they going to do when reality comes crashing in on them?
[00:53:22.762 --> 00:53:25.544]  And the answer is they're going to try to stage race war.
[00:53:25.544 --> 00:53:27.545]  They're going to try to stage false flags.
[00:53:27.545 --> 00:53:29.547]  They're going to try to demonize their opposition.
[00:53:29.547 --> 00:53:39.654]  The Army is now training that if you think Black Lives Matter and its riots is the same thing as the Capitol riot, that you are a white supremacist.
[00:53:39.654 --> 00:53:45.838]  If you think Jordan Soros' Black Lives Matter that got $10.6 billion last year and burned down large parts of major cities across the U.S.
[00:53:46.605 --> 00:53:52.727]  If you think that that is on par with the Capitol, it's actually much smaller, with actual violence, then you're a terrorist, basically.
[00:53:52.727 --> 00:53:54.987]  When in truth, that's a PSYOP.
[00:53:54.987 --> 00:53:55.927]  It's not even on par.
[00:53:55.927 --> 00:53:59.428]  It's way, way, way, way, way worse what BLM and Antifa did.
[00:53:59.428 --> 00:54:04.549]  But again, we have Joe Behar and Nadler saying Antifa doesn't even exist.
[00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:07.310]  Imagine if we said the Capitol riot didn't really exist.
[00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:11.991]  Well, the way they exaggerated it didn't exist, but some bad things happened there and I didn't endorse that.
[00:54:11.991 --> 00:54:15.252]  So, again, the gaslighting isn't working.
[00:54:16.229 --> 00:54:18.411]  And emblematic of that is Joe Biden.
[00:54:18.411 --> 00:54:25.939]  If they had a well-spoken, good-looking man or woman up there who'd stolen the election, they might have a chance to actually keep this fraud going.
[00:54:25.939 --> 00:54:33.867]  But the fact that he's so weak, so pathetic, so ridiculous, the fact that Kamala only got half a percentage point vote for Democrats back in the primary shows
[00:54:34.477 --> 00:54:39.618]  The establishment is totally disconnected and believes they can engage in whatever fraud they want, whenever they want.
[00:54:39.618 --> 00:54:46.420]  So the LARPing, the playing along by Democrats, that they're part of the system, is coming home to roost that it's not true.
[00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:48.800]  And that indeed, they got suckered.
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:50.901]  And so there's a huge populist awakening.
[00:54:50.901 --> 00:54:52.961]  Tucker Carlson knows that.
[00:54:52.961 --> 00:54:55.242]  Of course, people like Bill Maher know that.
[00:54:55.242 --> 00:54:55.762]  I know that.
[00:54:55.762 --> 00:54:56.502]  You know that.
[00:54:56.502 --> 00:54:58.363]  And we really should come together.
[00:54:58.363 --> 00:54:59.163]  Pass Joe Biden.
[00:54:59.163 --> 00:54:59.903]  Pass Donald Trump.
[00:55:00.698 --> 00:55:14.102]  And stop letting figureheads get us into a fight, and really think about basic liberties, basic freedoms, the horrible forced inoculations, the lockdowns, the global government, the starving third world, and all the things that are affecting us in reality.
[00:55:14.102 --> 00:55:15.082]  Okay?
[00:55:15.082 --> 00:55:23.164]  Trump did some good things overall, I'm glad I supported him overall, and I hope he can keep the Republican Party populist, and that we continue to build that beachhead.
[00:55:23.164 --> 00:55:24.985]  But we can't just keep counting on him
[00:55:26.289 --> 00:55:28.571]  And all these fantasy groups of the government to save us.
[00:55:28.571 --> 00:55:30.332]  We have to start changing our lives.
[00:55:30.332 --> 00:55:39.079]  Like all the people filing suit in Virginia and New York and Michigan and California and winning in court that these lockdowns are unconstitutional.
[00:55:39.079 --> 00:55:46.285]  We need to champion that and stop complying with orders that are not constitutional and that are fraudulent and they're designed to shut down our real economy.
[00:55:46.325 --> 00:55:50.529]  Alex Jones here with the new InfoWars sale and it is a fantastic sale.
[00:55:50.529 --> 00:55:54.594]  It is many of our best-selling products that just so happen to also be selling out.

[00:56:04.982 --> 00:56:05.763]  It's amazing.

[00:56:25.651 --> 00:56:29.293]  Essential oils, natural deodorants, shampoos, conditioners.
[00:56:29.293 --> 00:56:30.553]  A whole host of products.
[00:56:30.553 --> 00:56:33.394]  The entire Emmerich's Essentials line is close to selling out.
[00:56:33.394 --> 00:56:34.555]  We're coming in a few months.
[00:56:34.555 --> 00:56:40.318]  But despite that, right now, ladies and gentlemen, they're all 50% off as well, with free shipping.
[00:56:40.318 --> 00:56:42.038]  Just follow the banners at Infowarshore.com.
[00:56:42.038 --> 00:56:44.259]  It's a huge savings, and it funds the Infowar.
[00:56:44.259 --> 00:56:44.520]  A 360 win.
[00:56:48.388 --> 00:56:53.569]  Throughout history there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes of the two.
[00:56:53.569 --> 00:56:56.590]  One is born of renaissance, the other is born of conquest.
[00:56:56.590 --> 00:57:05.652]  One bases its power on having a strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture and ingenuity and art and skill and strength.
[00:57:05.652 --> 00:57:11.053]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above it.
[00:57:12.033 --> 00:57:20.059]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one of total mass high-tech slavery.
[00:57:20.059 --> 00:57:23.742]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[00:57:23.742 --> 00:57:28.005]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters.
[00:57:28.565 --> 00:57:30.306]  A global permanent lockdown is here.
[00:57:30.306 --> 00:57:33.708]  It's already causing millions and millions to starve to death.
[00:57:33.708 --> 00:57:35.869]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[00:57:35.869 --> 00:57:43.733]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general have come out and said the COVID lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[00:57:43.733 --> 00:57:44.433]  That's the facts.
[00:57:44.433 --> 00:57:50.516]  This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[00:57:50.516 --> 00:57:53.138]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:05.051 --> 00:58:09.754]  I want to follow up with a couple things that Alex covered in that last segment.
[00:58:09.754 --> 00:58:16.539]  And then I've got this stack of fake pandemic COVID news that is just mind-blowing.
[00:58:16.539 --> 00:58:23.583]  First, you know, he mentioned the demasculization and we showed some articles there of the United States military versus the Chinese military.
[00:58:23.583 --> 00:58:28.426]  And guys, if you just want to roll the b-roll there, a Chinese military recruitment video
[00:58:29.756 --> 00:58:44.700]  Has just been kind of going viral and people are noticing that the Chinese military is very masculine in their recruitment videos and they don't even show a single woman!
[00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:46.700]  Isn't that amazing?
[00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:56.483]  Meanwhile our military is being forced to pay for transsexual surgeries, wear high heels and other such nonsense but the Chinese
[00:58:57.633 --> 00:59:03.975]  People's Liberation Army is putting out promotional videos that don't even feature a woman.
[00:59:03.975 --> 00:59:06.755]  So that may or may not tell you something.
[00:59:06.755 --> 00:59:13.357]  And then I have this video, and this is a very odd one, really just shows the complete breakdown of civilization here in clip one.
[00:59:13.357 --> 00:59:23.139]  A Filipino man is berated as a Chinese man by a white supremacist, wink wink, check out this white supremacist, wink wink,
[00:59:23.952 --> 00:59:27.315]  Uh, berating and harassing an Asian man on the New York subway.
[00:59:44.905 --> 01:00:01.497]  Of course, the irony there, it's not a white man, it's a black man.
[01:00:01.497 --> 01:00:05.020]  And then, of course, he's touching the railing on the subway and then touching his mask.
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:05.420]  That's good.
[01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:07.742]  That's like, just lick, you might as well lick the railing.
[01:00:07.742 --> 01:00:08.603]  But that's another story.
[01:00:09.617 --> 01:00:14.701]  Now, the strange thing about this, most of the stuff that this black guy on the subway is saying is actually true!
[01:00:14.701 --> 01:00:22.166]  He's calling out the Chinese Communists, arresting and killing black people, arresting and detaining Muslims, and all the other stuff that they have in the slave camps.
[01:00:22.166 --> 01:00:29.892]  So he's like, right on, but it's like, why are you directing that at this guy sitting on a subway?
[01:00:29.892 --> 01:00:31.673]  Like, what is that?
[01:00:31.673 --> 01:00:36.557]  Now, this guy may be a little bit out of his mind, based on what he's wearing,
[01:00:38.348 --> 01:00:42.570]  But so it's just crazy times to be alive.
[01:00:42.570 --> 01:00:46.272]  But there's a white supremacist harassing an Asian man on the train.
[01:00:46.272 --> 01:00:48.894]  But everything you said is true.
[01:00:48.894 --> 01:00:50.795]  But again, why are you yelling at this guy on a train?
[01:00:50.795 --> 01:00:53.576]  That doesn't really make sense.
[01:00:53.576 --> 01:01:01.841]  But when we come back, I'm going to get into this stack of the fake pandemic news developments that's just going to blow your mind.
[01:01:01.841 --> 01:01:04.642]  But here's part of the issue we face.
[01:01:04.642 --> 01:01:06.063]  And I've talked about this a lot.
[01:01:06.698 --> 01:01:09.480]  We are in a race against time.
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:15.143]  Imagine it as two wicks going towards a big firework.
[01:01:15.143 --> 01:01:17.004]  Wicks, you know, burn pretty slow.
[01:01:17.004 --> 01:01:20.566]  You've got time to run or whatever.
[01:01:20.566 --> 01:01:34.515]  You've got the wick of the globalists, which has been burning, slow-burning to get to this firework, which is the explosion of humanity into the new age with all the technology, the life extensions, everything that they've just been sitting on.
[01:01:36.613 --> 01:01:50.763]  And you've got the globalists whose wick's been building and they want to be in control of that explosion so that when it happens and humanity enters this new era, they'll be in total control and humanity will be enslaved by the elite.
[01:01:50.763 --> 01:02:01.290]  Then you have the we the people, the citizens of Earth, the average Joe, the average Jill, and now we're awakening and our wick is burning fast, getting to that explosion, but it's a race against time.
[01:02:01.290 --> 01:02:02.551]  And so here's the analogy.
[01:02:03.815 --> 01:02:07.217]  Dan Bongino is taking over Rush Limbaugh's time slot in a lot of those stations.
[01:02:07.217 --> 01:02:09.698]  He's not really taking over for Rush Limbaugh.
[01:02:09.698 --> 01:02:16.201]  My guess is he won't have near the success, but Bongino, very popular on the internet, and he will have success in that radio slot.
[01:02:16.201 --> 01:02:19.763]  And he's much more hardcore than Rush.
[01:02:19.763 --> 01:02:23.324]  I'm a big fan of Rush, have been since I was a kid, love Rush, I miss him every day.
[01:02:23.324 --> 01:02:25.805]  I like Dan Bongino.
[01:02:25.805 --> 01:02:30.348]  Dan Bongino is more hardcore against the Deep State and the New World Order than Rush Limbaugh.
[01:02:30.348 --> 01:02:31.168]  Here's the problem.
[01:02:31.986 --> 01:02:35.568]  Even Dan Bongino is not hardcore enough to defeat these people.
[01:02:35.568 --> 01:02:37.889]  And I love Dan Bongino.
[01:02:37.889 --> 01:02:40.491]  But see, it's the InfoWars narrative.
[01:02:40.491 --> 01:02:44.994]  That's the hardcore information warfare that can defeat the New World Order.
[01:02:44.994 --> 01:02:54.439]  And until everyone gets in this mindset that we have here at InfoWars, not saying we're perfect, but we understand the enemy, until everyone gets that mindset, then can our wick burn fast enough.
[01:02:59.571 --> 01:03:00.772]  Granny Do-Right.
[01:03:00.772 --> 01:03:01.572]  Granny Do-Right.
[01:03:01.572 --> 01:03:02.533]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:03:02.533 --> 01:03:03.253]  Go ahead.
[01:03:03.253 --> 01:03:03.774]  Hey, Alex.
[01:03:03.774 --> 01:03:06.375]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[01:03:06.375 --> 01:03:07.416]  I am a granny.
[01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:17.082]  And for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[01:03:17.082 --> 01:03:23.086]  But since taking Urex 2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[01:03:23.086 --> 01:03:24.107]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[01:03:26.368 --> 01:03:34.071]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[01:03:34.071 --> 01:03:42.834]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[01:03:42.834 --> 01:03:43.654]  This is working.
[01:03:43.654 --> 01:03:44.655]  This is wonderful.
[01:03:44.655 --> 01:03:49.196]  You know, I don't, I don't have to put on Dermablend anymore, you know.
[01:03:49.196 --> 01:03:53.838]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully, and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[01:03:58.052 --> 01:04:04.593]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[01:04:04.593 --> 01:04:08.014]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:04:08.014 --> 01:04:13.455]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are into the second hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:13.455 --> 01:04:18.996]  I actually have, I told my producer here, I'm doing double duty today, hosting the Alex Jones Show, and then the War Room later today.
[01:04:18.996 --> 01:04:24.237]  I have enough news today to cover six or seven hours of news, so I'm gonna maybe even struggle to get through all of it.
[01:04:25.481 --> 01:04:33.189]  But I have in front of me a stack of the fake pandemic COVID news here that is really, quite frankly, mind boggling.
[01:04:33.189 --> 01:04:44.581]  And if everybody could understand this, if this could go mainstream and people could actually consume this rationally, logically, without their
[01:04:45.327 --> 01:04:46.927]  Preconditioned bias.
[01:04:46.927 --> 01:04:48.408]  It would be game over.
[01:04:48.408 --> 01:05:01.111]  And I see all these people celebrating New Zealand reopened back up, and they've got big concerts, and all the lefty libs are saying, See, New Zealand followed the science and masked and vaccinated, now they get to be open!
[01:05:01.111 --> 01:05:03.011]  We could have been open the whole time!
[01:05:03.011 --> 01:05:06.372]  I've been open the whole time!
[01:05:06.372 --> 01:05:07.372]  You've embraced tyranny!
[01:05:07.372 --> 01:05:09.573]  Remember Obama said, there's no tyranny lurking around the corner?
[01:05:09.573 --> 01:05:11.593]  Uh-oh, here it is!
[01:05:11.593 --> 01:05:14.834]  Yep, you just experienced it, and now people are celebrating the tyranny.
[01:05:16.073 --> 01:05:17.674]  See, just go along with the tyranny.
[01:05:17.674 --> 01:05:20.835]  It's better for everyone.
[01:05:20.835 --> 01:05:23.776]  Never!
[01:05:23.776 --> 01:05:28.517]  But so, let's get into some of this COVID nonsense today.
[01:05:28.517 --> 01:05:36.780]  According to the world meters on new cases, new cases are at record lows for COVID in the United States of America.
[01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:37.760]  Nobody's talking about that.
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:40.241]  Nobody's celebrating that because that's not part of the agenda.
[01:05:41.152 --> 01:05:49.918]  And the states that have the most new cases are not Florida or Texas that are wide open, or California with the most population.
[01:05:49.918 --> 01:05:59.264]  No, it's New York and New Jersey where they still have the strictest lockdowns and strictest mask measures.
[01:05:59.264 --> 01:06:02.967]  And of course probably the most inflated cases.
[01:06:02.967 --> 01:06:05.308]  So just keep that in the back of your mind.
[01:06:05.308 --> 01:06:08.030]  Again, it's all just the flu anyway.
[01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:09.491]  Here's some data out of Sweden
[01:06:12.162 --> 01:06:21.928]  And Chechya, where it shows Sweden with 18% mask compliance down here at virtually zero COVID now.
[01:06:21.928 --> 01:06:29.493]  And you have Chechya, which has 86% mask compliance, still at highs for COVID.
[01:06:29.493 --> 01:06:30.274]  Why would that be?
[01:06:30.274 --> 01:06:33.156]  Because masks spread disease.
[01:06:34.429 --> 01:06:38.351]  Masks spread disease.
[01:06:38.351 --> 01:06:41.692]  Masks spread disease.
[01:06:41.692 --> 01:06:43.093]  And Fauci knows this.
[01:06:43.093 --> 01:06:45.414]  He wrote scientific papers on this.
[01:06:45.414 --> 01:06:50.056]  So why would that dirtbag rat be telling you to wear two masks?
[01:06:50.056 --> 01:06:53.658]  I think a criminal investigation may be needed for crimes against humanity.
[01:06:53.658 --> 01:06:55.699]  Into Anthony Fauci.
[01:06:55.699 --> 01:06:56.579]  I go on.
[01:06:56.579 --> 01:06:58.620]  Look at some of the torture.
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:02.121]  Here's your crime against humanity for this fake pandemic.
[01:07:02.121 --> 01:07:03.182]  From a student
[01:07:04.389 --> 01:07:05.930]  This is at the College Fix.
[01:07:05.930 --> 01:07:09.694]  I've tested negative for COVID 17 times this semester.
[01:07:09.694 --> 01:07:14.398]  My school still forces me to wear a mask outside and alone.
[01:07:14.398 --> 01:07:16.540]  So imagine that.
[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:18.702]  And this is at every university.
[01:07:18.702 --> 01:07:19.283]  Imagine that.
[01:07:19.283 --> 01:07:24.928]  At every university they're making you take 17 nose swabs.
[01:07:24.928 --> 01:07:26.209]  Which is not good for you folks.
[01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:29.652]  It's not good to be shoving a thing up your nose.
[01:07:29.652 --> 01:07:30.113]  It's not.
[01:07:30.859 --> 01:07:33.680]  It does damage to your sinuses and other such things.
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:36.101]  But so they just do that 17 times a semester.
[01:07:36.101 --> 01:07:39.803]  Nobody's testing positive and they say still wear the mask, still take the test every day.
[01:07:39.803 --> 01:07:41.584]  Disgusting!
[01:07:41.584 --> 01:07:43.344]  How we treat ourselves like slaves.
[01:07:43.344 --> 01:07:45.665]  We've just totally embraced our medical charity.
[01:07:45.665 --> 01:07:48.887]  Totally embraced our slavery to COVID.
[01:07:48.887 --> 01:07:51.047]  Oh, and how do you think this one's gonna go?
[01:07:51.047 --> 01:07:55.549]  Robot doctors take over hospital to reduce COVID spread.
[01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:59.291]  And so now they have the little dog robot with a tablet on it like a face.
[01:08:00.367 --> 01:08:04.210]  And now that's your doctor, you know, to stop the spread of COVID.
[01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:08.334]  So now you'll have robot doctors being brought in because of COVID.
[01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:10.316]  So you won't even see a human anymore.
[01:08:10.316 --> 01:08:12.377]  That'll only be for the rich elite politicians.
[01:08:12.377 --> 01:08:16.921]  That'll only be for the rich elite Hollywood actors and actresses to see an actual doctor.
[01:08:16.921 --> 01:08:23.187]  You're going to get some AI robot machine telling you what you need to do.
[01:08:23.187 --> 01:08:25.709]  Oh, that'll be fun.
[01:08:25.709 --> 01:08:27.991]  Israeli Jews petition international criminal court.
[01:08:28.698 --> 01:08:32.400]  Say, Israel's mandatory COVID vaccines violate Nuremberg Code.
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:35.222]  Yes, every country needs to follow.
[01:08:35.222 --> 01:08:41.826]  And I'm not a big fan of Greg Abbott, but he has been emphatic that the state of Texas will never force vaccinate anyone.
[01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:45.027]  So, God bless Texas for that.
[01:08:45.027 --> 01:08:52.752]  But in Israel, it's like the Nazis have taken over and they are now forcing everybody to take the COVID vaccine in order to get their freedoms back.
[01:08:53.692 --> 01:08:55.433]  Yeah, that's a crime against humanity.
[01:08:55.433 --> 01:08:57.134]  It violates the Nuremberg Code.
[01:08:57.134 --> 01:09:01.638]  Anybody responsible for that needs to go to jail.
[01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:04.900]  But they're embraced as heroes for taking all of our freedoms.
[01:09:06.687 --> 01:09:10.088]  Story at Infowars.com with the peer-reviewed study.
[01:09:10.088 --> 01:09:10.948]  Trust the science.
[01:09:10.948 --> 01:09:14.930]  Peer-reviewed studies suggest CDC inflated COVID-19 fatalities.
[01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:16.710]  That's right, just like we reported.
[01:09:16.710 --> 01:09:18.351]  Gunshot deaths were COVID.
[01:09:18.351 --> 01:09:20.271]  Getting run over by a car was COVID.
[01:09:20.271 --> 01:09:21.732]  Drowning was COVID.
[01:09:21.732 --> 01:09:24.033]  Being 110 years old was COVID.
[01:09:24.033 --> 01:09:27.494]  It was all COVID, and it was all so the hospitals could get payouts.
[01:09:27.494 --> 01:09:34.436]  We had that story a year ago, but now the real scientists and researchers and peer-reviewed studies are coming out saying, yep,
[01:09:34.836 --> 01:09:36.797]  It was all a fake pandemic.
[01:09:36.797 --> 01:09:38.198]  It doesn't stop there.
[01:09:38.198 --> 01:09:40.900]  Former FDA commissioner.
[01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:44.742]  Social distancing was costly and was never based on clear science.
[01:09:44.742 --> 01:09:45.582]  That's right.
[01:09:45.582 --> 01:09:50.465]  And now all the people that promoted it, New York Times, Washington Post, they're looking around saying, who first said six feet?
[01:09:50.465 --> 01:09:51.226]  Where did this came from?
[01:09:51.226 --> 01:09:51.686]  Well, I don't know.
[01:09:51.686 --> 01:09:52.166]  I thought you did.
[01:09:52.166 --> 01:09:52.586]  I don't know.
[01:09:52.586 --> 01:09:53.767]  I thought you did it.
[01:09:53.767 --> 01:09:54.387]  Nobody knows.
[01:09:54.387 --> 01:09:55.428]  Where did six feet come from?
[01:09:55.428 --> 01:09:57.029]  It was never scientific.
[01:09:57.029 --> 01:09:59.070]  It was always made up.
[01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:02.052]  And it all came out of that rat behind Anthony Fauci.
[01:10:07.094 --> 01:10:09.235]  Moving on.
[01:10:09.235 --> 01:10:11.936]  COVID vaccine motivation.
[01:10:11.936 --> 01:10:17.418]  Krispy Kreme is giving away free donuts for showing vaccination card.
[01:10:17.418 --> 01:10:20.879]  Gross!
[01:10:20.879 --> 01:10:25.821]  So this is going to become the new marketing campaign, I'm guessing, is going to be mocked.
[01:10:26.641 --> 01:10:28.602]  That starts with Krispy Kreme.
[01:10:28.602 --> 01:10:31.443]  Oh, you'll get a free, you know, Big Mac from McDonald's.
[01:10:31.443 --> 01:10:33.484]  You'll get a free Whopper from Burger King.
[01:10:33.484 --> 01:10:34.265]  You'll get this.
[01:10:34.265 --> 01:10:35.785]  Just show us your vaccine card.
[01:10:35.785 --> 01:10:38.507]  We're beating a pandemic.
[01:10:38.507 --> 01:10:48.111]  Folks, please do not insert a experimental gene therapy technology into your body for a donut.
[01:10:48.111 --> 01:10:49.752]  Okay?
[01:10:49.752 --> 01:10:50.713]  And yeah, exactly.
[01:10:50.713 --> 01:10:55.395]  That's what obese people need is more donuts that are already at the most risk to die from anything.
[01:10:56.593 --> 01:11:01.255]  But wow, this story out of Bloomberg is incredible.
[01:11:01.255 --> 01:11:04.316]  Are mRNA COVID vaccines risky?
[01:11:04.316 --> 01:11:06.237]  Here's what the experts say.
[01:11:06.237 --> 01:11:12.459]  And in an incredible admission, they admit this is not really a vaccine.
[01:11:12.459 --> 01:11:15.821]  They admit this is all experimental and we don't know.
[01:11:15.821 --> 01:11:19.782]  And they even get into the side effects.
[01:11:19.782 --> 01:11:21.743]  I mean, and it won't stop anything.
[01:11:22.478 --> 01:11:24.700]  The people will still beg for the vaccine.
[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:29.384]  But see, this is a left-wing, left-leaning news outlet, Bloomberg.
[01:11:29.384 --> 01:11:32.206]  They just published it all, but it's just, oh, it's just matter-of-fact.
[01:11:32.206 --> 01:11:33.488]  It's, oh, you just go along with it.
[01:11:33.488 --> 01:11:35.709]  Oh, just go along with the new experimental technology.
[01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:36.910]  Oh, just everybody get it.
[01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:38.472]  Oh, just deal with the side effects.
[01:11:38.472 --> 01:11:45.017]  Like, for example, this individual promoting that, oh, I have asthma, so I got my vaccine first.
[01:11:45.017 --> 01:11:47.480]  Hee hee.
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:48.961]  Josh Whitacombe,
[01:11:50.063 --> 01:11:56.508]  Bragging that he gets his vaccine first because he has asthma, so celebrating his own slavery.
[01:11:56.508 --> 01:12:05.815]  And here's the incredible thing, and the writers are working on a story on this, if you scroll down in the comments folks, see we open up the phone lines and we take calls from people
[01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:16.015]  That have had first-hand experience with negative side effects from the vaccine, whether it's them, or their family members, or their neighbors, or their friends, or their nurses, or doctors, or teachers, and it's just all day long.
[01:12:16.015 --> 01:12:19.157]  We've done like five shows just all day long, just hundreds of calls.
[01:12:19.157 --> 01:12:20.638]  Yeah, negative side effects.
[01:12:20.638 --> 01:12:21.339]  Arm went numb.
[01:12:21.339 --> 01:12:21.959]  Collapsed.
[01:12:21.959 --> 01:12:22.819]  Got sick.
[01:12:22.819 --> 01:12:24.260]  Knows somebody that died.
[01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:25.641]  Non-stop.
[01:12:25.641 --> 01:12:35.727]  There are people celebrating, and you won't even believe this, there are people celebrating in the comments, in the replies to this individual, all of them saying they had negative side effects!
[01:12:36.904 --> 01:12:37.505]  Aches!
[01:12:37.505 --> 01:12:38.246]  Pains!
[01:12:38.246 --> 01:12:39.888]  Shivers!
[01:12:39.888 --> 01:12:40.730]  Headaches!
[01:12:40.730 --> 01:12:41.391]  Nausea!
[01:12:41.391 --> 01:12:42.011]  Sickness!
[01:12:42.011 --> 01:12:42.652]  Numbness!
[01:12:42.652 --> 01:12:44.915]  They're bragging about it!
[01:12:44.915 --> 01:12:47.158]  I've never seen anything so insane!
[01:12:47.158 --> 01:12:50.563]  And then, of course, you have the soy boy face there.
[01:12:50.563 --> 01:12:53.227]  The soy boy slave face, loving his vaccine.
[01:12:53.968 --> 01:12:58.011]  And then the people bragging about how they got the vaccine because they had this and they got the vaccine.
[01:12:58.011 --> 01:12:59.593]  Oh, they love their New World Order.
[01:12:59.593 --> 01:13:01.154]  They love their New World Order slavery.
[01:13:01.154 --> 01:13:03.196]  See, it's like being the first to be a slave.
[01:13:03.196 --> 01:13:03.976]  They're excited.
[01:13:03.976 --> 01:13:06.018]  We're the first to be New World Order slaves.
[01:13:06.018 --> 01:13:07.819]  We're the first on the slave plantation.
[01:13:07.819 --> 01:13:08.480]  Yeah!
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.441]  Take that!
[01:13:10.441 --> 01:13:15.525]  And you go and scroll through the comments, and it's all people talking about, oh, I got the vaccine.
[01:13:15.525 --> 01:13:16.386]  My arm went numb.
[01:13:16.386 --> 01:13:17.287]  Oh, I got the vaccine.
[01:13:17.287 --> 01:13:18.228]  I passed out.
[01:13:18.228 --> 01:13:19.008]  I got the vaccine.
[01:13:19.008 --> 01:13:21.510]  I got sick.
[01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:22.691]  And it's just all public.
[01:13:22.691 --> 01:13:23.432]  It's all out there.
[01:13:25.029 --> 01:13:33.072]  Story out of... I'm not sure the name of this website.
[01:13:33.072 --> 01:13:34.252]  This is brought to me by the crew.
[01:13:34.252 --> 01:13:37.653]  If you don't get sick after coronavirus vaccine, is your immune system not working?
[01:13:37.653 --> 01:13:40.234]  Well, it's going to make you more sick than you've ever been.
[01:13:40.234 --> 01:13:42.015]  But yeah, it's rewriting your immune system.
[01:13:42.015 --> 01:13:43.215]  It's killing your immune system.
[01:13:43.215 --> 01:13:48.657]  It's giving you a synthetic biotechnology immune system.
[01:13:48.657 --> 01:13:50.017]  Folks, it doesn't stop there.
[01:13:50.017 --> 01:13:52.618]  I'll have more on this fake pandemic nonsense after the break.
[01:13:54.105 --> 01:13:56.486]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[01:13:56.486 --> 01:13:58.227]  It's very bittersweet.
[01:13:58.227 --> 01:14:01.208]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[01:14:01.208 --> 01:14:02.469]  And now we have a lot of credibility.
[01:14:02.469 --> 01:14:03.389]  But I don't care about that.
[01:14:03.389 --> 01:14:05.430]  I care about beating the New World Order.
[01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:10.132]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[01:14:10.132 --> 01:14:13.493]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[01:14:13.493 --> 01:14:15.014]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[01:14:15.014 --> 01:14:16.194]  But let's just say this.
[01:14:16.194 --> 01:14:17.515]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[01:14:17.515 --> 01:14:19.976]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[01:14:20.616 --> 01:14:24.238]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at mfulworthstore.com.
[01:14:24.238 --> 01:14:26.819]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[01:14:26.819 --> 01:14:30.000]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:30.840]  Do they fund freedom?
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:31.961]  No, a lot of them don't.
[01:14:31.961 --> 01:14:38.423]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[01:14:38.423 --> 01:14:40.144]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[01:14:40.144 --> 01:14:42.985]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[01:14:43.545 --> 01:14:46.666]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[01:14:46.666 --> 01:14:54.248]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[01:14:54.248 --> 01:15:02.170]  Emerix Essentials is all-natural, all-organic, high-end, quality, clean, self-care products.
[01:15:02.170 --> 01:15:06.091]  And they are 50% off right now at InfoWars store.
[01:15:07.927 --> 01:15:09.868]  Free shipping for a limited time.
[01:15:09.868 --> 01:15:14.970]  That is the three essential oil all-natural hand sanitizers.
[01:15:14.970 --> 01:15:23.174]  That's all of these high-end super pure quality essential oils and basically every popular set that's out there.
[01:15:23.174 --> 01:15:26.295]  Then of course we have the natural shampoo, organic.
[01:15:26.295 --> 01:15:27.776]  We also have the body wash.
[01:15:27.776 --> 01:15:32.958]  It's all there and our best-selling organic deodorant from Enrich's
[01:15:32.978 --> 01:15:34.739]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:16:13.856 --> 01:16:24.386]  All right, I'm going to finish up with the COVID news here, but we've got major world developments happening right now, and the world is destabilizing by design.
[01:16:24.386 --> 01:16:26.108]  That's why the UN says build back better.
[01:16:26.917 --> 01:16:33.242]  And then all the political operatives of the UN promote the Build Back Better campaign, including Joe Biden.
[01:16:33.242 --> 01:16:35.784]  But yeah, they see the United States destabilizing.
[01:16:35.784 --> 01:16:37.865]  They see it destabilized by design.
[01:16:37.865 --> 01:16:39.166]  They know Biden isn't stable.
[01:16:39.166 --> 01:16:40.487]  He could pop off at any moment.
[01:16:40.487 --> 01:16:41.688]  A war could start at any moment.
[01:16:41.688 --> 01:16:48.453]  And it's just like the whole world is destabilizing because the United States of America is destabilizing because we have an unstable president.
[01:16:48.453 --> 01:16:49.654]  So the border is collapsing.
[01:16:49.654 --> 01:16:51.976]  The economy could collapse at any minute.
[01:16:51.976 --> 01:16:55.559]  And Biden is up there napping asleep at the switch.
[01:16:56.969 --> 01:17:08.954]  And it's all by design, so I'll get to some of that world developing news, world development news, coming up here shortly and some other political news coming out of the Democrat Party, but I want to finish this.
[01:17:08.954 --> 01:17:21.540]  So, the story at Bloomberg, again, saying that it's not a vaccine, it's experimental technology,
[01:17:22.677 --> 01:17:23.358]  It's risky.
[01:17:23.358 --> 01:17:25.319]  I mean, covering all of it, right there in Bloomberg.
[01:17:25.319 --> 01:17:28.341]  But, oh, matter-of-factly, and it's just okay, and we just go along with it.
[01:17:28.341 --> 01:17:28.961]  Don't worry about it.
[01:17:28.961 --> 01:17:32.204]  Don't ask any other questions.
[01:17:32.204 --> 01:17:33.305]  It's not totally effective.
[01:17:33.305 --> 01:17:34.766]  They even admit it.
[01:17:34.766 --> 01:17:35.726]  But, you know, it's good.
[01:17:35.726 --> 01:17:37.848]  It's good we're testing this on you.
[01:17:37.848 --> 01:17:43.512]  It's good you're a human guinea pig for Big Pharma that makes billions of dollars a day.
[01:17:43.512 --> 01:17:45.313]  That's a good thing for you.
[01:17:45.313 --> 01:17:49.936]  But that was out of left-leaning Bloomberg.
[01:17:49.936 --> 01:17:50.997]  Now, another one
[01:17:51.812 --> 01:17:57.453]  This one didn't really have people as upset, the liberals reading it.
[01:17:57.453 --> 01:17:58.353]  They thought it's cool.
[01:17:58.353 --> 01:18:00.573]  Ooh, I'm getting brand new technology!
[01:18:00.573 --> 01:18:01.474]  Ooh, I'm elite!
[01:18:01.474 --> 01:18:02.234]  Woohoo!
[01:18:02.234 --> 01:18:06.334]  Yeah, you're a slave is what you are.
[01:18:06.334 --> 01:18:15.216]  But then you had this individual, Professor Emily Oster, write a piece for The Atlantic.
[01:18:15.216 --> 01:18:18.977]  Again, this is more hardcore left-leaning even.
[01:18:18.977 --> 01:18:20.037]  Kids are low-risk.
[01:18:20.037 --> 01:18:21.137]  Go ahead and plan the summer.
[01:18:22.378 --> 01:18:25.360]  Plan a family vacation with your unvaccinated kids.
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:28.721]  And oh my gosh.
[01:18:28.721 --> 01:18:33.784]  The response, the hate, the attacks that this lady got.
[01:18:33.784 --> 01:18:35.505]  And you go look at her story in the Atlantic.
[01:18:35.505 --> 01:18:36.866]  It's all just science.
[01:18:36.866 --> 01:18:37.886]  It's all just data.
[01:18:37.886 --> 01:18:40.488]  She just totally gets all the data, compiles it, and says, you know what?
[01:18:40.488 --> 01:18:42.089]  It's safe to go on the vacation this year.
[01:18:42.089 --> 01:18:43.209]  Congratulations.
[01:18:43.209 --> 01:18:44.410]  And the liberals hate it!
[01:18:45.194 --> 01:18:46.475]  We don't want the data.
[01:18:46.475 --> 01:18:47.815]  We don't want the science.
[01:18:47.815 --> 01:18:49.416]  We don't want a vacation.
[01:18:49.416 --> 01:18:50.576]  We want fear.
[01:18:50.576 --> 01:18:51.917]  We want vaccines.
[01:18:51.917 --> 01:18:55.578]  We want everybody shut in and shut down.
[01:18:55.578 --> 01:18:59.339]  And it just shows you everything these people are about.
[01:18:59.339 --> 01:19:00.720]  They hate human freedom.
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:02.201]  They hate human activity.
[01:19:02.201 --> 01:19:04.541]  They hate a smiling face.
[01:19:04.541 --> 01:19:12.905]  They hate the light of God and the light of divine creation that you can see in someone's eyes and in their soul and their facial expressions.
[01:19:12.905 --> 01:19:13.805]  They hate all of it.
[01:19:15.208 --> 01:19:18.869]  They don't want you to go on a back dinner vacation.
[01:19:18.869 --> 01:19:20.750]  They don't want you to go back to school.
[01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:23.671]  They don't want you to go to that concert or that ball game.
[01:19:23.671 --> 01:19:29.354]  They want you vaccinated and they want you enslaved, staying in your home like a good sheep.
[01:19:29.354 --> 01:19:34.696]  Because that's who they are.
[01:19:34.696 --> 01:19:35.436]  It's scary.
[01:19:35.436 --> 01:19:36.276]  It's horrifying.
[01:19:36.276 --> 01:19:37.357]  It's unhuman.
[01:19:37.357 --> 01:19:40.718]  I don't recognize it.
[01:19:40.718 --> 01:19:41.398]  It's alien.
[01:19:41.398 --> 01:19:42.039]  It's foreign.
[01:19:42.039 --> 01:19:42.139]  It's...
[01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:47.982]  It's deviant.
[01:19:47.982 --> 01:19:57.729]  And until it is stood up to in brash force, and totally rejected, it will conquer our society.
[01:19:57.729 --> 01:20:09.817]  That's why you have Cardi B, with her song WAP, doing softcore porn videos for children, and then you go down to the Spring Breakers in Miami, and it's hundreds of women
[01:20:10.612 --> 01:20:17.678]  Stripping naked and shaking their butt like Cardi B. The total de-evolution of society.
[01:20:17.678 --> 01:20:19.559]  The total degradation.
[01:20:19.559 --> 01:20:23.062]  The total degenerization of society.
[01:20:23.062 --> 01:20:24.643]  Brought to you by Hollywood.
[01:20:24.643 --> 01:20:28.126]  Brought to you by the liberal left.
[01:20:28.126 --> 01:20:33.490]  They want you to be worn down, depressed, oppressed, and enslaved.
[01:20:33.490 --> 01:20:36.913]  Because that's who they are.
[01:20:36.913 --> 01:20:38.574]  Slaves to their father Satan.
[01:20:41.224 --> 01:20:49.571]  Moving on, because this explains why we have to deal with the fake pandemic.
[01:20:49.571 --> 01:20:54.875]  Federal judge alleges, kind of, alleges?
[01:20:54.875 --> 01:20:57.958]  No, he calls it out.
[01:20:57.958 --> 01:21:01.260]  But this is the Epoch Times headline.
[01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:07.525]  Federal judge allows, alleges Democrats are close to controlling all major news outlets.
[01:21:07.525 --> 01:21:08.006]  No, uh,
[01:21:09.065 --> 01:21:13.887]  Federal judge calls out the fact that the Democrats control all mainstream news outlets.
[01:21:13.887 --> 01:21:25.773]  That's what this federal judge did, who was part of the New York Times versus Sullivan decision, which he now regrets, saying that the media is now a monopolistic political power, and it needs to be reformed.
[01:21:25.773 --> 01:21:26.414]  It's not good.
[01:21:26.414 --> 01:21:26.934]  It's dangerous.
[01:21:26.934 --> 01:21:29.715]  It's going to destroy America.
[01:21:29.715 --> 01:21:30.616]  So people are getting it.
[01:21:32.176 --> 01:21:37.507]  It's kind of like you have Border Patrol and ICE agents going on record saying, I can't believe this is happening at the southern border.
[01:21:37.507 --> 01:21:39.451]  The Biden administration is committing treason.
[01:21:39.451 --> 01:21:40.874]  They've got the border wide open.
[01:21:40.874 --> 01:21:42.097]  This is a national emergency.
[01:21:42.097 --> 01:21:43.119]  Biden is to blame.
[01:21:44.326 --> 01:22:07.671]  Now you have a federal judge saying the Democrats control all media, they're killing free speech, they're censoring their opposition, and they're promoting their propaganda 24-7, which is New World Order propaganda, One World Government propaganda, UN propaganda, race-baiting propaganda, pro-China propaganda, never based in reality or truth, never based in logic or common sense, never with the basic principles and foundation of freedom.
[01:22:07.671 --> 01:22:09.391]  Never!
[01:22:09.391 --> 01:22:12.052]  So yeah, kind of a big deal when a federal judge who was
[01:22:12.771 --> 01:22:21.254]  The key decision in the New York Times vs. Sullivan landmark case says that the Democrat Party and their control of the media is a threat to America.
[01:22:21.254 --> 01:22:23.715]  Kind of a big deal.
[01:22:23.715 --> 01:22:26.175]  But see, this is part of the process that I'm talking about.
[01:22:26.175 --> 01:22:28.216]  America's waking up.
[01:22:28.216 --> 01:22:29.676]  People are coming out of their holes.
[01:22:29.676 --> 01:22:30.897]  They're coming out of their shells.
[01:22:30.897 --> 01:22:32.697]  They're coming out from under the rock.
[01:22:32.697 --> 01:22:38.059]  They're taking their head out from under the sand or up their ass or wherever it's been and they're saying, this is not good.
[01:22:38.059 --> 01:22:40.320]  There is a serious problem happening here.
[01:22:41.681 --> 01:22:50.183]  So the awakening is exploding forward, but the New World Order has always been 40 years ahead of us.
[01:22:50.183 --> 01:22:54.744]  So they've got like a tiny little gap before they get control of the world.
[01:22:54.744 --> 01:23:00.145]  We've got a massive gap to make up to beat them to the punch.
[01:23:00.145 --> 01:23:02.345]  And even though it's dead on arrival, it doesn't even matter.
[01:23:02.345 --> 01:23:03.646]  They're still rolling it out.
[01:23:03.646 --> 01:23:10.507]  I mean, look at Biden falling down flights of steps, not doing press conferences, can't even talk.
[01:23:10.507 --> 01:23:10.767]  Oh, but
[01:23:12.128 --> 01:23:15.210]  It looks like the Democrats may have the ouster coming soon for Biden.
[01:23:15.210 --> 01:23:17.352]  I'm going to talk about that coming up.
[01:23:17.352 --> 01:23:23.896]  China using COVID-19 vaccine to push Huawei in Latin America, Southern Command warns.
[01:23:23.896 --> 01:23:30.240]  So yeah, oh, we're going to bring in Huawei and we'll make deals with you and we'll give you our 5G.
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:35.964]  But just here, you know, take our vaccines and we'll make a deal, a good deal with you with Huawei.
[01:23:35.964 --> 01:23:38.746]  Just go under our control and we'll bring you Huawei.
[01:23:40.868 --> 01:23:44.349]  Guarantee you Biden won't say a thing about that.
[01:23:44.349 --> 01:23:50.632]  And of course, as Alex mentioned earlier, China, the big trade winner from lockdowns in the West, that's out of the telegraph.
[01:23:50.632 --> 01:23:54.133]  So yeah, the left and China control our media.
[01:23:54.133 --> 01:23:55.894]  They just faked a pandemic.
[01:23:55.894 --> 01:23:57.495]  China came out on top.
[01:23:57.495 --> 01:23:58.955]  Go figure.
[01:23:58.955 --> 01:24:08.819]  So China, the adversary of the United States, controls our White House now, owns Biden, controls our media, owns our media, controls our Hollywood, owns our Hollywood, controls our sports leagues.
[01:24:10.319 --> 01:24:14.781]  And any celebrity that's sold out that wants to get into the Chinese market, they own all of them.
[01:24:14.781 --> 01:24:23.646]  So yeah, they faked a pandemic, China stayed open, and then China increased its GDP.
[01:24:23.646 --> 01:24:25.287]  China increased its output.
[01:24:25.287 --> 01:24:29.829]  China increased its number of millionaires and billionaires.
[01:24:29.829 --> 01:24:31.970]  While we, the American people, suffered.
[01:24:33.027 --> 01:24:39.589]  The massive losses during the fake pandemic, and now the people in our country are so brainwashed, they love it.
[01:24:39.589 --> 01:24:42.390]  The liberals still wear two, three masks.
[01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:44.031]  They harass you if you don't wear a mask.
[01:24:44.031 --> 01:24:44.991]  They love the lockdown.
[01:24:44.991 --> 01:24:46.391]  They don't want businesses back open.
[01:24:46.391 --> 01:24:48.012]  They don't want schools back open.
[01:24:48.012 --> 01:24:55.935]  Why don't they just go live in a cave like their Neanderthal cousins?
[01:24:55.935 --> 01:25:00.016]  Look, I've proven that Infowars information is some of the best in the world.
[01:25:00.931 --> 01:25:03.435]  It's just absolutely on target.
[01:25:03.435 --> 01:25:06.479]  The globalists can't scan us because we've studied how they operate.
[01:25:06.479 --> 01:25:08.021]  They want to keep you in the dark.
[01:25:08.021 --> 01:25:10.785]  I believe in humanity and I want to see you empowered.
[01:25:10.785 --> 01:25:12.807]  Because I know that John F. Kennedy was right.
[01:25:12.807 --> 01:25:14.430]  A raising tide raises all ships.

[01:25:44.157 --> 01:25:47.280]  Take action today at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:25:52.834 --> 01:25:56.436]  Humanity has been domesticated, by and large.
[01:25:56.436 --> 01:26:00.998]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all gonna pass.
[01:26:00.998 --> 01:26:09.883]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being culled, being totally enslaved.
[01:26:10.203 --> 01:26:14.668]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[01:26:14.668 --> 01:26:32.206]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with a third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us, under such a crisis, under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees.
[01:26:32.786 --> 01:26:48.614]  Not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[01:26:48.614 --> 01:26:53.456]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[01:26:53.456 --> 01:27:01.660]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[01:27:02.924 --> 01:27:07.668]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.

[01:29:06.274 --> 01:29:11.175]  In fact, I know we've just sold out of a few things.
[01:29:11.175 --> 01:29:13.136]  I've got a fresh sheet here.
[01:29:13.136 --> 01:29:17.297]  Yeah, we have sold out of VesoBeat Complete, and

[01:29:45.453 --> 01:29:53.317]  A lot of our popular supplements are not available right now because there's been a breakdown in the supply chain, folks.
[01:29:53.317 --> 01:29:54.998]  It's all by design.
[01:29:54.998 --> 01:30:02.341]  So if you're noticing at InfoWarsStore.com how it's taking longer to replenish our supply on some of these supplements, it's just like we told you.
[01:30:02.341 --> 01:30:07.063]  This is a supply chain collapse to hurt the U.S.
[01:30:07.063 --> 01:30:08.544]  economy.
[01:30:08.544 --> 01:30:10.545]  China's not having this problem, but oh, we are.
[01:30:11.331 --> 01:30:18.138]  Thanks to our Democrat overlords shutting down our economy and committing treason against this country.
[01:30:18.138 --> 01:30:19.900]  That's what they seem to do on a daily basis.
[01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:21.021]  Isn't it amazing?
[01:30:21.021 --> 01:30:30.110]  And they have built a wall around Congress to ensure that their treason can go guarded and protected by the United States military.
[01:30:30.110 --> 01:30:32.933]  So remember folks, InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:32.933 --> 01:30:34.174]  The sale is happening right now.
[01:30:35.029 --> 01:30:41.132]  And if you don't have a water filter, an air filter, emergency food supplies, those are must-have things in the household.
[01:30:41.132 --> 01:30:45.253]  So take advantage of the specials right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:30:45.253 --> 01:30:56.298]  And you know, I'm thinking about this now, what's happening to our military, and it's really, it's really sad.
[01:30:56.298 --> 01:30:56.919]  It's really sad.
[01:30:56.919 --> 01:30:59.900]  So let me build up with this stack of news here to get to this point.
[01:31:02.546 --> 01:31:04.367]  This is how things work.
[01:31:04.367 --> 01:31:08.610]  This is how things work in the Biden administration.
[01:31:08.610 --> 01:31:19.078]  So, you just had 24 individuals charged in a voter fraud probe in North Carolina.
[01:31:19.078 --> 01:31:20.579]  Wow!
[01:31:20.579 --> 01:31:25.782]  24 people charged over voter fraud in North Carolina.
[01:31:25.782 --> 01:31:28.985]  So, that just came down the pipeline.
[01:31:28.985 --> 01:31:29.205]  But,
[01:31:30.922 --> 01:31:52.226]  The judge, the federal prosecutor, excuse me, Robert Higdon, that was appointed by Trump, after he got the 24 charges of voter fraud in North Carolina, Joe Biden called and requested that he would resign.
[01:31:52.226 --> 01:31:54.407]  Isn't that something?
[01:31:54.407 --> 01:31:58.928]  You do your job, you do it well, Joe Biden gives you a phone call, not to congratulate you, but to lay off.
[01:32:01.329 --> 01:32:01.989]  Imagine that.
[01:32:01.989 --> 01:32:10.494]  So, Robert Higdon finds 24 counts of voter fraud in North Carolina, gets the evidence, gets the charges.
[01:32:10.494 --> 01:32:14.676]  Next day, Biden calls and says, please, you're fired.
[01:32:14.676 --> 01:32:16.657]  Wow.
[01:32:16.657 --> 01:32:17.158]  Hmm.
[01:32:17.158 --> 01:32:21.980]  Who's trying to cover up voter fraud, I wonder?
[01:32:21.980 --> 01:32:23.721]  Oh, boy.
[01:32:23.721 --> 01:32:28.904]  Now, here's the Democrat control of our apparatus rearing its ugly head.
[01:32:29.767 --> 01:32:33.549]  California bill would ban members of hate groups.
[01:32:33.549 --> 01:32:36.450]  We all know what that means, right?
[01:32:36.450 --> 01:32:44.314]  Whitey, Trump supporter, anything pro-patriotic, pro-Second Amendment, that's now considered a hate group.
[01:32:44.314 --> 01:32:47.895]  Otherwise, they would have introduced a bill like this long ago if it was about actual hate groups.
[01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:51.917]  But no, you just assume if you're in a hate group, you're not getting hired anyway.
[01:32:51.917 --> 01:32:55.039]  That's called the United States of America's free market.
[01:32:55.039 --> 01:32:57.960]  But the left doesn't like to promote that, so they want total control of it.
[01:32:58.832 --> 01:33:06.517]  And so now they're saying that if you are in a hate group, you cannot join the California police force.
[01:33:06.517 --> 01:33:07.598]  So what does that really mean?
[01:33:07.598 --> 01:33:16.623]  Again, if you're a Trump supporter, if you're a patriot, you're pro-Second Amendment, if you listen to InfoWars, you're no longer allowed to be a cop.
[01:33:16.623 --> 01:33:21.346]  And of course they know that that will pretty much bring the police force down to nothing.
[01:33:21.346 --> 01:33:24.288]  Most cops are patriots, Second Amendment activists.
[01:33:25.067 --> 01:33:27.289]  So it's all by design to destroy the police force.
[01:33:27.289 --> 01:33:28.971]  California is going to be the worst.
[01:33:28.971 --> 01:33:30.753]  They're going to be hit by it first.
[01:33:30.753 --> 01:33:35.057]  So expect crime in California to continue to skyrocket.
[01:33:35.057 --> 01:33:38.901]  And expect California to continue to turn into a third world hell hole.
[01:33:40.525 --> 01:33:57.659]  As the California police is going to be dissolved from within and now externally anybody who wants to join it if you've ever watched an InfoWars broadcast or you know been in a pro-Second Amendment group or anything like that or voted for Trump they won't let you become a police officer now.
[01:33:57.659 --> 01:34:04.244]  Not just happening though inside the police force but also happening inside the military.
[01:34:04.244 --> 01:34:08.748]  Remember the Democrats were doing interviews with all the Border Patrol
[01:34:09.697 --> 01:34:10.277]  In D.C.
[01:34:10.277 --> 01:34:15.860]  to make sure they didn't vote for Trump, and then if they found out they were Trump supporters, they'd be kicked out.
[01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:17.141]  Oh, well, maybe not yet.
[01:34:17.141 --> 01:34:19.562]  That's coming.
[01:34:19.562 --> 01:34:32.509]  And now the Pentagon is going to be doing extremism training for troops who see Capitol riot and BLM protests as similar.
[01:34:32.509 --> 01:34:37.132]  So, the Democrat Party and the left wing have now completely politicized our military.
[01:34:38.314 --> 01:34:41.336]  The United States military is no longer the United States military.
[01:34:41.336 --> 01:34:45.179]  It's now a left-wing activist group.
[01:34:45.179 --> 01:34:47.700]  So look at everything that the left-wing and the Democrats have taken over.
[01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:48.461]  Hollywood?
[01:34:48.461 --> 01:34:49.782]  It's no longer about movies.
[01:34:49.782 --> 01:34:51.823]  It's no longer about entertainment.
[01:34:51.823 --> 01:34:54.785]  It's about left-wing Democrat propaganda.
[01:34:54.785 --> 01:34:55.746]  Look at the news.
[01:34:55.746 --> 01:34:57.027]  It's no longer about truth.
[01:34:57.628 --> 01:34:59.149]  It's no longer about actual news.
[01:34:59.149 --> 01:35:01.129]  It's left-wing Democrat propaganda.
[01:35:01.129 --> 01:35:02.530]  Look at our sports leagues.
[01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:04.110]  It's no longer about sports.
[01:35:04.110 --> 01:35:05.831]  It's no longer about fun.
[01:35:05.831 --> 01:35:08.392]  It's all left-wing Democrat propaganda.
[01:35:08.392 --> 01:35:10.232]  And so now it's the police force.
[01:35:10.232 --> 01:35:12.833]  Now it's the military.
[01:35:12.833 --> 01:35:16.874]  The Democrat Party are totalitarians.
[01:35:16.874 --> 01:35:18.055]  So what does that mean?
[01:35:18.055 --> 01:35:24.937]  That means they want, and if not stopped, will get control of everything.
[01:35:26.607 --> 01:35:29.728]  They get control of the border, look at what happens, the border disappears.
[01:35:29.728 --> 01:35:32.009]  So even the border has been politicized!
[01:35:32.009 --> 01:35:34.030]  They politicize everything.
[01:35:34.030 --> 01:35:38.271]  These are sick, demented people that we're dealing with.
[01:35:38.271 --> 01:35:41.772]  And they are the biggest threat in the world right now.
[01:35:41.772 --> 01:35:49.595]  Leftism, leftist authoritarianism, leftist globalism, leftist global tyranny,
[01:35:51.863 --> 01:36:00.907]  And of course, there's the elite at the top of all this, running the stage, the separate societies with the Bill Gates and the Klaus Schwabs and all of it.
[01:36:00.907 --> 01:36:12.272]  But the only reason they're able to be successful is because they're able to brainwash and control and manipulate the left wing in this country that's allied and merged with them.
[01:36:13.524 --> 01:36:17.505]  So yeah, the biggest threat to humanity is not man-made climate change.
[01:36:17.505 --> 01:36:18.685]  It's not Donald Trump.
[01:36:18.685 --> 01:36:19.906]  It's not all the stuff they tell you.
[01:36:19.906 --> 01:36:23.306]  It's left-wing totalitarianism.
[01:36:23.306 --> 01:36:24.967]  That's the biggest threat to humanity.
[01:36:24.967 --> 01:36:26.327]  That's the biggest threat to planet Earth.
[01:36:26.327 --> 01:36:27.668]  That's the biggest threat to freedom.
[01:36:27.668 --> 01:36:31.689]  But they don't value freedom, so they don't really care.
[01:36:31.689 --> 01:36:39.270]  So now they're in control of the police force, and they'll make sure it's only left-wing radicals or criminals that get in there that they can control.
[01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:41.031]  And they'll do the same thing with the military now.
[01:36:42.791 --> 01:36:48.614]  And the saddest part of all of this, folks, and Cassandra Fairbanks is working on a story.
[01:36:48.614 --> 01:36:54.377]  She says this, I'm getting so many emails from veterans who were arrested at the Capitol.
[01:36:54.377 --> 01:36:59.860]  The government is basically using their service as a point in the prosecution against them.
[01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:04.723]  Yet Antifa and BLM can terrorize cities and be released without bail.
[01:37:04.723 --> 01:37:08.645]  She's responding to all and she's going to try to write a story about each individual.
[01:37:10.337 --> 01:37:13.078]  And publish that at the Gateway Pundit.
[01:37:13.078 --> 01:37:14.559]  So, I've been talking about this.
[01:37:14.559 --> 01:37:18.321]  I'm glad Cassandra Fairbanks is finally picking up the ball and rolling with it.
[01:37:18.321 --> 01:37:20.502]  Folks, the Democrat Party already has concentration camps.
[01:37:20.502 --> 01:37:22.283]  The Democrat Party already has detention centers.
[01:37:22.283 --> 01:37:24.564]  The Democrat Party already has the Dulogs.
[01:37:24.564 --> 01:37:30.307]  There are dozens, if not hundreds, of Trump supporters that are rotting in jails right now.
[01:37:30.307 --> 01:37:34.269]  Dozens, if not hundreds, of military veterans that are rotting in jail right now.
[01:37:34.269 --> 01:37:34.729]  Now remember,
[01:37:35.583 --> 01:37:37.445]  Why do the Democrats hate the military?
[01:37:37.445 --> 01:37:41.809]  Because the military pledged to fight all enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:37:41.809 --> 01:37:42.629]  Well, what does that mean?
[01:37:42.629 --> 01:37:44.571]  The Democrat Party is the domestic enemy.
[01:37:44.571 --> 01:37:49.996]  So they have to throw the veterans in jail because they know they're the enemy that the military swore to fight against.
[01:37:51.554 --> 01:37:55.738]  Alex Jones here with the new InfoWars sale and it is a fantastic sale.

[01:38:37.495 --> 01:38:40.416]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[01:38:40.416 --> 01:38:44.637]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[01:38:44.637 --> 01:38:46.998]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[01:39:02.503 --> 01:39:06.867]  The big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[01:39:06.867 --> 01:39:12.633]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[01:39:12.633 --> 01:39:24.245]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[01:39:24.845 --> 01:39:26.967]  I need your help more than ever now.
[01:39:26.967 --> 01:39:31.089]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[01:39:31.089 --> 01:39:41.696]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at InfoWareStore.com.

[01:39:51.241 --> 01:39:51.882]  Thank you so much.
[01:39:53.676 --> 01:40:01.741]  As you know, we're always upping our game at InfoWars, and we've brought you a new supplement, a new product that we know you're gonna love, especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[01:40:01.741 --> 01:40:02.822]  It is Down-N-Out.
[01:40:02.822 --> 01:40:04.643]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[01:40:04.643 --> 01:40:07.624]  We mean down your bed, sleeping hard throughout the night.
[01:40:07.624 --> 01:40:10.686]  It's got 4 milligrams of high-quality melatonin.
[01:40:10.686 --> 01:40:13.248]  It's got 25 milligrams of passionflower.

[01:40:32.439 --> 01:40:34.420]  Talk about blasting off to sleep, it's incredible.
[01:40:34.420 --> 01:40:36.941]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.

[01:40:56.231 --> 01:41:01.496]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us.

[01:41:55.150 --> 01:41:57.742]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:42:12.885 --> 01:42:19.227]  We are dealing with a Democrat mainstream media insurrection against the United States of America.
[01:42:19.227 --> 01:42:23.628]  In my view, it's open treason against this country.
[01:42:23.628 --> 01:42:26.269]  And so that's why they have their walls around the Capitol.
[01:42:26.269 --> 01:42:29.890]  That's why they have their censorship of the media.
[01:42:29.890 --> 01:42:34.992]  And that's why Joe Biden is hiding and won't do a press conference.
[01:42:34.992 --> 01:42:38.873]  Because everybody knows Trump won in a record landslide and they stole it from him.
[01:42:39.651 --> 01:42:43.272]  Everybody knows that Biden couldn't fill a high school gymnasium.
[01:42:43.272 --> 01:42:46.073]  He couldn't even fill a high school locker, let alone a locker room.
[01:42:46.073 --> 01:42:48.013]  He couldn't even fill a locker.
[01:42:48.013 --> 01:42:50.074]  Everybody knows they've opened the border wide open.
[01:42:50.074 --> 01:42:50.954]  It's total sedition.
[01:42:50.954 --> 01:42:51.774]  It's total treason.
[01:42:51.774 --> 01:42:54.475]  Everybody knows that Biden shut down our energy.
[01:42:54.475 --> 01:42:56.615]  Everybody knows gas prices are skyrocketing.
[01:42:56.615 --> 01:42:59.556]  Everybody knows that violent crime is skyrocketing.
[01:42:59.556 --> 01:43:03.557]  And if the media wasn't there protecting the Democrat Party and Biden,
[01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:07.712]  Everybody would know it's the Democrat Party and Biden responsible.
[01:43:07.712 --> 01:43:09.473]  And of course, this is just common sense.
[01:43:09.473 --> 01:43:18.539]  You look at any major city in America that's been run by Democrats for 50 years, it's the highest crime rate in the country.
[01:43:18.539 --> 01:43:20.440]  And it's not even close.
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:23.742]  It's also got the highest rates of poverty in the country.
[01:43:23.742 --> 01:43:32.567]  So imagine, Democrats take control of the major cities 50 years ago and drive every single one of them into poverty and violent crime.
[01:43:32.567 --> 01:43:33.688]  And they still vote Democrat.
[01:43:34.565 --> 01:43:37.267]  Or do they?
[01:43:37.267 --> 01:43:45.032]  I'm not so sure we've had any real elections in this country for a long time, at least not in mass.
[01:43:45.032 --> 01:44:03.765]  So, this is the issue at hand and I just hope that America can have a great awakening in response to all of this within enough time that we can salvage what we have left here in America and build another prosperous
[01:44:05.166 --> 01:44:31.031]  civilization into through the 2020th century and beyond but at this rate with the current system of control and the Democrats going full authoritarianism and totalitarian it's not looking good they will dissolve the United States of America into a one world government and all the things that we've taken for granted private property
[01:44:33.983 --> 01:44:43.566]  Ease of access, options for food and groceries and everything else in between and schools, all of it will be gone.
[01:44:43.566 --> 01:44:45.887]  Gone.
[01:44:45.887 --> 01:44:46.807]  And I mean, I get it.
[01:44:46.807 --> 01:44:51.808]  I get why the average person on Fox News that has a million dollar salary doesn't get freaked out by this.
[01:44:51.808 --> 01:44:52.809]  Of course they're not.
[01:44:52.809 --> 01:44:54.109]  They got everything they need.
[01:44:54.109 --> 01:44:55.630]  They're living in the lap of luxury.
[01:44:55.630 --> 01:44:57.810]  They're kicking it at the country club.
[01:44:57.810 --> 01:45:02.412]  It's all good, baby.
[01:45:02.412 --> 01:45:03.532]  No, this is serious stuff.
[01:45:05.385 --> 01:45:19.077]  And I have a feeling that for the first time since Biden has been in office that the long knives are now out for him and there is an active agenda to remove him.
[01:45:19.077 --> 01:45:29.806]  And the reason I'm saying this is because last night I saw more anti-Biden headlines and pro-Kamala Harris headlines than I've ever seen.
[01:45:29.806 --> 01:45:33.529]  So that usually means there's a plan afoot when you understand
[01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:41.382]  How the media and the Democrat Party operates in their collusion and in their agendas.
[01:45:41.382 --> 01:45:44.583]  Here's a couple examples from Slate.com.
[01:45:44.583 --> 01:45:51.866]  Joe Biden wiped out big time on the Air Force One stairs and then they talk about how he can't walk, he's not having press conferences, what is going on?
[01:45:51.866 --> 01:45:52.606]  Uh-oh!
[01:45:53.982 --> 01:45:56.624]  Of course, you have Biden saying President Harris.
[01:45:56.624 --> 01:45:57.925]  How many times has he said that now?
[01:45:57.925 --> 01:45:59.866]  Ten times he says President Harris?
[01:45:59.866 --> 01:46:02.568]  You had Biden the other day saying that Harris was smarter than him?
[01:46:02.568 --> 01:46:03.549]  Well, then why did you run?
[01:46:03.549 --> 01:46:06.531]  Why did you even run, Joe, if Harris is so great?
[01:46:06.531 --> 01:46:08.633]  By the way, Harris didn't receive a single vote.
[01:46:08.633 --> 01:46:09.673]  She dropped out of the race.
[01:46:09.673 --> 01:46:11.995]  She was the least popular candidate.
[01:46:11.995 --> 01:46:17.279]  She also said that she believed the accusers against Joe Biden of the sexual assault and harassment.
[01:46:17.279 --> 01:46:18.540]  So it's funny how that's all changed.
[01:46:19.406 --> 01:46:21.387]  But Biden, why did you even run?
[01:46:21.387 --> 01:46:31.350]  If you're so weak and you can't handle a press conference and you can't handle the crises and you think Harris is smarter, then why did you even run, Joe?
[01:46:31.350 --> 01:46:34.611]  They're getting ready to wipe him out, folks.
[01:46:34.611 --> 01:46:41.454]  Washington Times, President in Waiting, Harris Seizes Spotlight with Biden's Future Uncertain.
[01:46:41.454 --> 01:46:41.534]  Oh.
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:51.585]  Oh, now I don't think Harris has ever seized anything except for maybe Willie Brown's jock.
[01:46:51.585 --> 01:46:52.966]  But boy, oh boy.
[01:46:52.966 --> 01:46:55.128]  You know, I'll be honest.
[01:46:55.128 --> 01:46:56.429]  Dealing with Biden is one thing.
[01:46:56.429 --> 01:46:58.530]  I never really have to deal with him.
[01:46:58.530 --> 01:47:09.917]  If they put Harris in and she'll probably be accompanied by Pelosi, I mean, the disaster that that's going to be is just unforeseeable, quite frankly.
[01:47:09.917 --> 01:47:10.838]  I really don't even know.
[01:47:12.992 --> 01:47:20.539]  Because it's going to turn into a tea party with them, like little girls playing at, you know, a picnic in the summer at a park.
[01:47:20.539 --> 01:47:27.565]  And it'll be all fun and games, and they'll destroy this country, they'll destroy millions of Americans' lives, they'll completely wreck everything.
[01:47:28.300 --> 01:47:30.342]  And they'll just laugh about it and glad-ham themselves.
[01:47:30.342 --> 01:47:30.982]  We're women!
[01:47:30.982 --> 01:47:31.743]  We're in charge!
[01:47:31.743 --> 01:47:33.284]  We're running the show!
[01:47:33.284 --> 01:47:33.844]  Yay!
[01:47:33.844 --> 01:47:35.505]  And the whole world will go to hell.
[01:47:35.505 --> 01:47:38.027]  And war will break out around the world.
[01:47:38.027 --> 01:47:42.250]  And Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi will be up there clinking glasses saying, We did it for women!
[01:47:42.250 --> 01:47:42.931]  Yay!
[01:47:42.931 --> 01:47:49.135]  Joe Biden says at some point he will visit the border.
[01:47:49.135 --> 01:47:51.897]  At some point, guys.
[01:47:51.897 --> 01:47:53.318]  At some point.
[01:47:53.318 --> 01:47:57.261]  We don't know when because, well, Joe doesn't know when because he's told what to do and when to do it.
[01:47:58.528 --> 01:48:05.574]  But at some point, the double mask wearing, can't walk or talk freak says at some point he'll visit the border.
[01:48:05.574 --> 01:48:08.737]  Boy, now we know why they had to get Warnock in there so bad.
[01:48:08.737 --> 01:48:10.738]  Probably a lot of blackmail on this guy.
[01:48:10.738 --> 01:48:12.840]  A lot of blackmail on this guy.
[01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:19.005]  I mean, think about just what we know about him and the abuse he covered up at the church in Georgia.
[01:48:20.565 --> 01:48:24.446]  When he ran over his wife during a domestic dispute.
[01:48:24.446 --> 01:48:25.646]  That's just what we know about him.
[01:48:25.646 --> 01:48:27.987]  Imagine what we don't know about this guy.
[01:48:27.987 --> 01:48:31.167]  But the Democrats had to steal that election in Georgia to get him in.
[01:48:31.167 --> 01:48:33.508]  Well, here's what he's up to.
[01:48:33.508 --> 01:48:35.709]  He's pushing for voting rights.
[01:48:35.709 --> 01:48:38.129]  Of course, we all know what that means.
[01:48:38.129 --> 01:48:41.990]  Giving Democrats ease of access to cheating and legalizing their big cheat.
[01:48:42.992 --> 01:48:44.793]  So that's what that's really about.
[01:48:44.793 --> 01:48:46.294]  Everybody already has voting rights.
[01:48:46.294 --> 01:48:48.454]  If you ask a Democrat, what voting rights do we need?
[01:48:48.454 --> 01:48:49.375]  They couldn't tell you.
[01:48:49.375 --> 01:48:50.936]  Everybody's already got it.
[01:48:50.936 --> 01:48:53.177]  So that's a big lie.
[01:48:53.177 --> 01:48:57.979]  Warnock says reasonable gun reform is a necessity because of the Atlanta shootings.
[01:48:57.979 --> 01:48:59.099]  There it is.
[01:48:59.099 --> 01:48:59.980]  There it is.
[01:48:59.980 --> 01:49:00.860]  We were waiting for it.
[01:49:00.860 --> 01:49:03.641]  We weren't sure when it was going to come, but there it is.
[01:49:03.641 --> 01:49:05.302]  Blame the gun.
[01:49:05.302 --> 01:49:07.343]  Blame the gun, as usual.
[01:49:09.437 --> 01:49:19.104]  Doesn't matter that there's cities in Georgia that have the highest percentage of gun ownership in America, and they have the lowest percentage in violent crime.
[01:49:19.104 --> 01:49:21.045]  Ho ho!
[01:49:21.045 --> 01:49:23.267]  But I wouldn't expect the Georgia Senator to know that.
[01:49:23.267 --> 01:49:25.308]  Why would I expect him to know anything about his own state?
[01:49:25.308 --> 01:49:27.370]  After all, he's a Democrat.
[01:49:27.370 --> 01:49:34.775]  All he knows is the agenda that he's told to promote, and the words that he's told to say.
[01:49:36.457 --> 01:49:37.978]  So that's what the Democrats are up to.
[01:49:37.978 --> 01:49:39.018]  Isn't it fun?
[01:49:39.018 --> 01:49:40.999]  The Democrats are politicizing our military.
[01:49:40.999 --> 01:49:42.679]  The Democrats are politicizing our police.
[01:49:42.679 --> 01:49:44.400]  The Democrats are coming for our Second Amendment.
[01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:46.400]  They're coming for our First Amendment.
[01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:50.742]  They're trying to destroy the integrity of our elections.
[01:49:50.742 --> 01:49:52.883]  Our southern border is wide open.
[01:49:52.883 --> 01:50:04.807]  Oh, and don't forget, Biden is also saber-rattling with China and with Putin and being laughed at because he's the most corrupt president we've ever had.
[01:50:04.807 --> 01:50:05.787]  China owns him.
[01:50:06.562 --> 01:50:13.131]  And so when Blinken shows up with the Chinese delegation, they laugh in his face saying, you don't have any standing here, we own your ass!
[01:50:13.131 --> 01:50:16.516]  You're corrupt, your president's corrupt, your media's corrupt, we own all of you!
[01:50:16.516 --> 01:50:18.659]  Don't sit here and try to lecture me, you fool!
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:27.886]  And the amazing thing is, I mean, look, to China's, I mean, you gotta be honest, I mean, China, obviously, I'm no fan of the Communist Party, but, like, they're being honest about the situation!
[01:50:27.886 --> 01:50:39.195]  They're telling the world, we own Biden, we own the United States of America, you will be destabilized, it will be the Chinese 21st century, and we're going for world power!
[01:50:39.195 --> 01:50:40.196]  They're bragging about it!
[01:50:40.196 --> 01:50:41.177]  They're set up to do it!
[01:50:42.003 --> 01:50:43.764]  They've put in the proper measures!
[01:50:43.764 --> 01:50:53.570]  China can go for world domination in the next 10 years, and it will all be thanks to Biden opening the doors in the West.
[01:50:53.570 --> 01:50:56.472]  But here's some of the other developing news there.
[01:50:56.472 --> 01:50:58.053]  Iran threatens U.S.
[01:50:58.053 --> 01:51:01.855]  Army post and top general.
[01:51:01.855 --> 01:51:06.618]  So again, Biden talking trash on Iran.
[01:51:06.618 --> 01:51:07.419]  But see, here's the thing.
[01:51:07.419 --> 01:51:10.881]  With Trump, it was measured, and he was actually communicating with these people.
[01:51:11.593 --> 01:51:13.975]  With Biden, he's not talking to them.
[01:51:13.975 --> 01:51:17.198]  Harris is talking to them, and Biden is unstable, and they all know it.
[01:51:17.198 --> 01:51:21.382]  So it's really just rude and disrespectful for Biden to be saying anything in public about any of this.
[01:51:21.382 --> 01:51:28.829]  Because Harris handles his international diplomatic phone calls, and Biden can't even remember what he ate for breakfast.
[01:51:28.829 --> 01:51:31.192]  And the whole world knows it.
[01:51:31.192 --> 01:51:32.333]  Japan and U.S.
[01:51:32.333 --> 01:51:35.536]  defense chiefs affirm cooperation over Taiwan emergency.
[01:51:37.293 --> 01:51:39.534]  Japan may deploy military to protect U.S.
[01:51:39.534 --> 01:51:40.214]  from China.
[01:51:40.214 --> 01:51:42.194]  Tokyo warns of Taiwan tensions.
[01:51:42.194 --> 01:51:46.616]  Seeks to deploy military overseas for the first time since 1945.
[01:51:46.616 --> 01:51:47.856]  Wow, boy!
[01:51:47.856 --> 01:51:54.698]  The war kits, the war drums, the war constellations are all coming into focus now, aren't they?
[01:51:54.698 --> 01:51:58.279]  Didn't take long, did it?
[01:51:58.279 --> 01:51:59.479]  Didn't take long, did it?
[01:51:59.479 --> 01:52:01.440]  Hey, say what you want about Trump.
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:02.840]  He didn't start these wars.
[01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:04.881]  He wasn't about the military-industrial complex.
[01:52:04.881 --> 01:52:05.741]  He wanted to end them.
[01:52:06.648 --> 01:52:09.911]  And, uh, he got sabotaged by the Pentagon many times, actually.
[01:52:09.911 --> 01:52:11.632]  He's learning about it now.
[01:52:11.632 --> 01:52:13.714]  So, uh, yeah, the New World Order wants a bunch of war.
[01:52:13.714 --> 01:52:17.917]  They need to kill about 50, 100 million people in a World War III scenario.
[01:52:17.917 --> 01:52:21.920]  And then bring in the world government to save us from war.
[01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:23.581]  But, hey, don't worry, guys.
[01:52:23.581 --> 01:52:29.366]  Buckingham Palace is considering a diversity czar in wake of the Meghan Markle interview.
[01:52:29.366 --> 01:52:34.130]  So an entitled briefcase model is bringing down the royal crown.
[01:52:35.422 --> 01:52:37.463]  I'm not even complaining.
[01:52:37.463 --> 01:52:41.504]  This one is a show.
[01:52:41.504 --> 01:52:49.406]  Emrix Essentials is all-natural, all-organic, high-end, quality, clean, self-care products.

[01:53:15.034 --> 01:53:21.436]  It's all there and our best-selling organic deodorant from Enric's Essentials.
[01:53:21.436 --> 01:53:23.717]  50% off and free shipping.
[01:53:23.717 --> 01:53:24.957]  Part of our big blowout
[01:53:24.997 --> 01:53:28.901]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[01:53:51.738 --> 01:53:58.222]  Even before I had an access TV show in the mid-1990s, I went and saw that movie and thought, man, that was fun.
[01:53:58.222 --> 01:54:03.326]  In fact, you speak out and have your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining because you're real.
[01:54:03.326 --> 01:54:05.127]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[01:54:07.177 --> 01:54:09.098]  We're not worthy!
[01:54:09.098 --> 01:54:13.059]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you.
[01:54:13.059 --> 01:54:15.060]  Because these topics are so huge, they're so real.
[01:54:15.060 --> 01:54:16.440]  But I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:18.501]  I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do.
[01:54:18.501 --> 01:54:20.162]  The globalists love lying to you.
[01:54:20.162 --> 01:54:21.502]  They love manipulating you.
[01:54:21.502 --> 01:54:24.143]  They enjoy destroying humanity.
[01:54:24.143 --> 01:54:28.705]  They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[01:54:28.705 --> 01:54:31.166]  That, for me, is really satan.
[01:54:31.166 --> 01:54:31.746]  And disgusting.
[01:54:31.746 --> 01:54:34.567]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole Infowars crew
[01:54:36.207 --> 01:54:38.070]  We will never join the Globals.
[01:54:38.070 --> 01:54:40.153]  We will never knowingly manipulate you.
[01:54:40.153 --> 01:54:46.061]  Because we know we're all in this together.
[01:54:46.061 --> 01:54:48.665]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:55:01.870 --> 01:55:05.331]  It's absolutely incredible to be witnessing all of this.
[01:55:05.331 --> 01:55:12.932]  But seriously, I mean... An entitled briefcase model, Meghan Markle may bring down the Royal Crown.
[01:55:12.932 --> 01:55:14.052]  I'm not even complaining.
[01:55:14.052 --> 01:55:24.854]  I mean, this bimbo, I'm no fan of hers, but... It's hilarious to see the Royal Crown squeamishly trying to figure out how to deal with her.
[01:55:24.854 --> 01:55:26.795]  It just shows how pathetic they really are.
[01:55:26.795 --> 01:55:27.755]  But it makes you wonder...
[01:55:29.756 --> 01:55:33.540]  Makes you wonder about that Prince Harry after all, doesn't it?
[01:55:33.540 --> 01:55:36.522]  Maybe there should be a DNA test.
[01:55:36.522 --> 01:55:37.583]  Just a thought.
[01:55:37.583 --> 01:55:42.408]  A DNA test for Prince Harry and his alleged father.
[01:55:42.408 --> 01:55:44.149]  Just an idea.
[01:55:44.149 --> 01:55:46.772]  There could be some serious stuff going on there.
[01:55:46.772 --> 01:55:52.056]  That's why it might not be making any sense on the surface level.
[01:55:52.056 --> 01:55:52.437]  Anyway.
[01:55:54.177 --> 01:56:01.480]  I have covered almost all of the news here that I was planning to get to, so I'm thinking about opening up the phone lines for the third hour and then I'll be back.
[01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:04.382]  I do have six hours worth of news today.
[01:56:04.382 --> 01:56:07.503]  I'll be back hosting the War Room from 3 to p.m.
[01:56:07.503 --> 01:56:07.943]  Central.
[01:56:07.943 --> 01:56:09.824]  That's what I normally host, but doing double duty today.
[01:56:09.824 --> 01:56:15.667]  So I've got plenty of news that I've got reserved that I'm going to cover there and other video clips.
[01:56:15.667 --> 01:56:18.028]  But I've been able to get through all my news here today.
[01:56:19.248 --> 01:56:22.691]  For the most part, so I'm thinking I'm gonna open up the phone lines when we come back.
[01:56:22.691 --> 01:56:28.636]  In fact, I'll get out that number now 877-789-2539 877-789-2539 to get in on the lines today and Anything we've covered so far is fair game.
[01:56:28.636 --> 01:56:29.817]  Here's the other headlines.
[01:56:29.817 --> 01:56:31.158]  I haven't gotten to yet and
[01:56:44.620 --> 01:56:47.941]  Is the fake UFO invasion inevitable?
[01:56:47.941 --> 01:56:48.281]  U.S.
[01:56:48.281 --> 01:56:53.983]  has secret evidence of UFOs breaking sound barrier without a sonic boom!
[01:57:01.661 --> 01:57:27.034]  So you have all this news about aliens and the Navy talking about UFOs, and now Air Force talking about UFOs, and commercial airline pilots talking about UFOs, and they're releasing all these, you know, like black box tapes and images and such, and now they say a UFO has broken the sound barrier without creating a sonic boom, so who knows what's really going on?
[01:57:27.034 --> 01:57:30.576]  But boy oh boy, you just feel like it's all playing out, part of a plan.
[01:57:31.897 --> 01:57:36.860]  For humanity that's been in place for for long, long periods of time.
[01:57:36.860 --> 01:57:39.802]  So when are they going to roll out the aliens?
[01:57:39.802 --> 01:57:42.864]  Looks like they're greasing the skids for that right now.
[01:57:42.864 --> 01:57:46.546]  Bernie Sanders in response to Elon Musk.
[01:57:46.546 --> 01:57:48.067]  So Bernie misses the mark again.
[01:57:48.067 --> 01:57:51.589]  But you know, his point is interesting here in responding to Elon Musk.
[01:57:52.219 --> 01:57:57.741]  Space travel is an exciting idea, but right now we need to focus on Earth and create a progressive tax system.
[01:57:57.741 --> 01:57:59.502]  Oh, there it is again, his tax system.
[01:57:59.502 --> 01:58:00.542]  Give me a break.
[01:58:00.542 --> 01:58:01.863]  Yeah, how about less taxes?
[01:58:01.863 --> 01:58:04.704]  See, here's the funny thing about liberals.
[01:58:04.704 --> 01:58:07.505]  They want more taxes so they can give you more money.
[01:58:07.505 --> 01:58:08.285]  Huh?
[01:58:08.285 --> 01:58:09.866]  What?
[01:58:09.866 --> 01:58:16.909]  That's literal mafia gangster, you know, give me your cut and then I'll give you a percentage.
[01:58:19.744 --> 01:58:26.092]  So Democrats and Bernie Sanders Communists want to take your money so they can give you a little bit of it back.
[01:58:26.092 --> 01:58:27.974]  But that's what he's all about.
[01:58:27.974 --> 01:58:29.476]  So that children don't go hungry.
[01:58:29.476 --> 01:58:32.860]  No, the free market solves poverty, not communism that creates poverty.
[01:58:33.877 --> 01:58:36.198]  People are not homeless and all Americans have health care.
[01:58:36.198 --> 01:58:37.818]  Again, the free market solves these issues.
[01:58:37.818 --> 01:58:38.598]  That's been proven.
[01:58:38.598 --> 01:58:40.139]  Communism kills these things.
[01:58:40.139 --> 01:58:44.120]  The level of inequality in America is obscene and a threat to our democracy.
[01:58:44.120 --> 01:58:46.841]  Again, all because of big government.
[01:58:46.841 --> 01:58:48.841]  Big government is killing the middle class.
[01:58:48.841 --> 01:58:51.322]  Taxes are killing the middle class.
[01:58:51.322 --> 01:58:53.223]  But this is in response to Elon Musk.
[01:58:53.223 --> 01:58:57.804]  Hey, Bernie, in case you didn't know, Elon Musk and SpaceX is in the private market.
[01:58:58.638 --> 01:59:08.962]  Now, people argue there's been a lot of money given to Elon Musk from the government to run some projects, but why not go after NASA, Bernie Sanders?
[01:59:08.962 --> 01:59:15.705]  Don't go after SpaceX, go after NASA that claims they have a new rocket that they can put on the moon!
[01:59:15.705 --> 01:59:21.527]  I think they're just saving face because they're getting their ass kicked by Elon Musk right now.
[01:59:21.527 --> 01:59:25.548]  But CNN has a story, scientists want to build a doomsday vault on the moon.
[01:59:25.548 --> 01:59:26.689]  Well, why would they want to do that?
[01:59:28.234 --> 01:59:31.717]  Because they, uh, are destroying the Earth by design.
[01:59:31.717 --> 01:59:38.702]  And the New World Order is coming, so they need a doomsday, uh, vault on the moon, which is gonna have sperm and seeds and humanoids and all this stuff to save humanity.
[01:59:38.702 --> 01:59:42.485]  So they care about humanity all of a sudden, but they wanna end the carbon life cycle.
[01:59:42.485 --> 01:59:46.588]  And by the way, here's an issue that we all face, and Elon Musk is the only one addressing.
[01:59:46.588 --> 01:59:48.129]  Traffic!
[01:59:48.129 --> 01:59:50.530]  What the hell, man?
[01:59:50.530 --> 01:59:53.753]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing Devil's Advocate on air.
[01:59:54.981 --> 01:59:57.843]  About looking at the world from the perspective of the globalists.
[01:59:57.843 --> 02:00:06.869]  That the public's so dumbed down that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them, that we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed.
[02:00:06.869 --> 02:00:08.631]  Yes, that's the position of the globalists.
[02:00:08.631 --> 02:00:09.431]  They play God.
[02:00:09.431 --> 02:00:14.274]  And they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[02:00:14.274 --> 02:00:17.116]  And I've told you that the globalists have tried to hire me.
[02:00:17.116 --> 02:00:18.557]  They've tried to get me to join them.
[02:00:18.557 --> 02:00:20.419]  But metaphysically, at a spiritual level,
[02:00:21.838 --> 02:00:22.758]  I have the Holy Spirit.
[02:00:22.758 --> 02:00:24.559]  I have connection with God.
[02:00:24.559 --> 02:00:27.319]  And I know that God does not like that, so I cannot join the enemy.
[02:00:27.319 --> 02:00:36.802]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with the system, believing you're part of it, or believing you're getting power out of it.
[02:00:36.802 --> 02:00:42.723]  Whether you're just a steel worker, or a school teacher, or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God.
[02:00:42.723 --> 02:00:49.265]  And treating other people like they're animals, and you're God, is something that the real God of the universe doesn't like.
[02:00:49.265 --> 02:00:49.965]  And that's a fact.
[02:00:59.335 --> 02:01:02.556]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[02:01:02.556 --> 02:01:08.978]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[02:01:08.978 --> 02:01:17.060]  The good news is the world is awakening to the lies of the mainstream media and the new world order agenda and the corruption within the Democrat Party.
[02:01:17.060 --> 02:01:20.541]  Americans are getting sick of the double standards, wide open southern border.
[02:01:20.541 --> 02:01:24.822]  They get to come in without masks, infected with COVID and released into the country.
[02:01:24.822 --> 02:01:27.283]  But every American is treated like a bio weapon.
[02:01:28.126 --> 02:01:32.629]  That needs to be mashed up, double masked up, tested every day and shut in.
[02:01:32.629 --> 02:01:33.730]  So Americans are sick of it.
[02:01:33.730 --> 02:01:36.492]  We still have a desire to be free, most of us.
[02:01:36.492 --> 02:01:41.395]  And so it will win out in the end, but it's going to be met with the new world order.
[02:01:41.395 --> 02:01:49.801]  And so it's going to be a true unstoppable object meeting an immovable force.
[02:01:49.801 --> 02:01:51.322]  We're about to see what that's going to look like.
[02:01:56.505 --> 02:02:10.929]  But you have to say, I mean, from my experience, just from going about town, I mean, I don't know if it's Biden voter remorse, because I don't think anybody voted for Biden, but it's Biden awareness.
[02:02:10.929 --> 02:02:12.349]  It's New World Order awareness.
[02:02:12.349 --> 02:02:14.550]  It's corruption awareness.
[02:02:14.550 --> 02:02:19.271]  And part of this is a backfire because of all the things they said about Trump.
[02:02:19.271 --> 02:02:22.752]  And they forced people, because of their attacks on Trump,
[02:02:23.917 --> 02:02:29.781]  They forced people to really pay attention to government and politics for the first time.
[02:02:29.781 --> 02:02:38.167]  And so, now that Trump is out, but they see all the issues still remain, and they're actually worse than ever, and it's not really making sense in their heads, so they need a new boogeyman.
[02:02:40.282 --> 02:02:46.646]  But the boogeyman isn't there because Biden is not seen and so then they just look at the overall issues and they say, huh?
[02:02:46.646 --> 02:02:48.207]  How come gas prices are going up?
[02:02:48.207 --> 02:02:51.468]  How come my energy is being shut off and prices going up?
[02:02:51.468 --> 02:02:53.029]  How come we don't have a southern border?
[02:02:53.029 --> 02:02:55.311]  How come they said stimulus money and we never got it?
[02:02:55.311 --> 02:03:00.594]  How come they passed $5 trillion stimulus in the last 12 months but I didn't get a dime?
[02:03:00.594 --> 02:03:02.635]  What's going on here?
[02:03:02.635 --> 02:03:04.456]  That's Washington politics as usual.
[02:03:06.304 --> 02:03:08.465]  And we wish Trump would have done something more about it.
[02:03:08.465 --> 02:03:16.687]  We wish he would have really fought him in a kamikaze style mission, but he bailed out at the end and he flew his jet to safety.
[02:03:16.687 --> 02:03:18.448]  And so that's fine.
[02:03:18.448 --> 02:03:20.608]  But that's where we're at.
[02:03:20.608 --> 02:03:22.129]  So the New World Order is back in command.
[02:03:23.539 --> 02:03:26.842]  And and the Biden administration is committing open treason on a daily basis.
[02:03:26.842 --> 02:03:27.863]  That's not just rhetoric.
[02:03:27.863 --> 02:03:29.044]  That's what they're doing.
[02:03:29.044 --> 02:03:31.726]  The southern border being wide open is the perfect example.
[02:03:31.726 --> 02:03:38.911]  So but not only is it open treason at the southern border, it's also crimes against humanity, stacking these people in like sardines.
[02:03:38.911 --> 02:03:45.356]  So first telling them to come here, they'll be taken care of, then stealing from us to take care of them.
[02:03:45.356 --> 02:03:49.600]  But then stuffing them like sardines into these cages.
[02:03:50.931 --> 02:03:55.374]  All for a political agenda to destabilize the United States of America.
[02:03:55.374 --> 02:03:56.915]  That's a crime against humanity.
[02:03:56.915 --> 02:04:04.880]  So the Democrat Party is committing open treason, open crimes against humanity, and the only reason they get away with it is because the media is there to protect them.
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:07.001]  That's it.
[02:04:07.001 --> 02:04:09.703]  So that's what we're dealing with.
[02:04:09.703 --> 02:04:11.184]  I've opened up the phone lines.
[02:04:11.184 --> 02:04:14.386]  Anything we've covered so far today on the Alex Jones Show is fair game.
[02:04:14.386 --> 02:04:16.468]  877-789-2539.
[02:04:16.468 --> 02:04:18.449]  I'll be here with you till 2 p.m.
[02:04:18.449 --> 02:04:20.070]  Guys, who's hosting the fourth hour today?
[02:04:23.022 --> 02:04:23.663]  Wonderful.
[02:04:23.663 --> 02:04:26.324]  Gerald Cilente, always the great Gerald Cilente.
[02:04:26.324 --> 02:04:27.905]  He's going to be hosting the fourth hour.
[02:04:27.905 --> 02:04:30.327]  I'll be handing him the baton at two in an hour.
[02:04:30.327 --> 02:04:35.310]  I'm going to take your phone calls till then, and then I'll be back in the driver's seat hosting the War Room today.
[02:04:35.310 --> 02:04:41.455]  Believe me, I've got... I held over a lot of news today that I didn't cover here that I'm going to cover in the War Room.
[02:04:41.455 --> 02:04:45.797]  A lot of video clips as well, and some great guests.
[02:04:45.797 --> 02:04:46.578]  So that's all coming up.
[02:04:47.588 --> 02:04:48.729]  But I want to take your phone calls.
[02:04:48.729 --> 02:04:50.351]  Guys, you give me the phone board there.
[02:04:50.351 --> 02:04:56.335]  Real quickly, remember InfoWarsStore.com, ladies and gentlemen, do not take InfoWars broadcasts for granted.
[02:04:56.335 --> 02:05:06.783]  You know, I was so used to just for the last, I don't know how many years, getting home from work and immediately tuning into Rush Limbaugh.
[02:05:06.783 --> 02:05:09.065]  And so it's not that I took Rush for granted.
[02:05:09.065 --> 02:05:13.388]  You know, he's passed on to to heaven.
[02:05:13.388 --> 02:05:14.049]  But I miss it.
[02:05:15.124 --> 02:05:15.765]  I miss that.
[02:05:15.765 --> 02:05:20.429]  I miss having Rush Limbaugh there when I got home from work.
[02:05:20.429 --> 02:05:22.291]  But that was inevitable.
[02:05:22.291 --> 02:05:24.112]  Everybody dies.
[02:05:24.112 --> 02:05:41.948]  Don't let that happen to InfoWars, where you're used to tuning in to InfoWars first thing in the morning, or you're used to listening to the Alex Jones Show at 11, or you're used to listening to the War Room at 3, or you go back at the end of the day and go to Band.Video and look at all the stuff we've covered.
[02:05:42.717 --> 02:05:46.479]  Don't wake up one day and have it gone.
[02:05:46.479 --> 02:05:49.800]  And it won't be because anybody or everybody here died.
[02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:52.501]  We've got a large crew.
[02:05:52.501 --> 02:05:54.702]  But it'll be because of the censorship.
[02:05:54.702 --> 02:05:59.804]  It'll be because of the attacks against us and the lies and everything that is going on behind the scenes.
[02:05:59.804 --> 02:06:03.226]  So your prayers always needed and appreciated.
[02:06:03.226 --> 02:06:07.988]  But remember about the financial support aspect of it at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:06:07.988 --> 02:06:10.949]  And so Alex is off today taking care of some serious business.
[02:06:11.872 --> 02:06:16.555]  I saw some people commenting on the show yesterday that I hosted, like, oh, where's Alex?
[02:06:16.555 --> 02:06:17.516]  Taking a break?
[02:06:17.516 --> 02:06:18.597]  What the heck, man?
[02:06:18.597 --> 02:06:19.357]  No.
[02:06:19.357 --> 02:06:21.799]  You even see Alex when he does actually take a vacation.
[02:06:21.799 --> 02:06:22.760]  He doesn't take a break.
[02:06:22.760 --> 02:06:24.761]  He's still here every day while he's on vacation.
[02:06:24.761 --> 02:06:32.486]  So when Alex is not in studio and you don't hear from him, that means he's up to some serious business.
[02:06:32.486 --> 02:06:34.427]  So your prayers.
[02:06:34.427 --> 02:06:36.469]  Maybe Alex can talk about this when he gets back.
[02:06:36.469 --> 02:06:39.171]  Hopefully it'll be some good stuff developing.
[02:06:39.171 --> 02:06:40.832]  But he is taking care of some serious stuff right now.
[02:06:41.730 --> 02:06:42.891]  So your prayers are always needed.
[02:06:42.891 --> 02:06:44.752]  Your financial support is always needed.
[02:06:44.752 --> 02:06:47.153]  Don't wake up and have that moment of taking it for granted.
[02:06:47.153 --> 02:06:48.834]  Man, I wish I would have supported InfoWars.
[02:06:48.834 --> 02:06:52.916]  I wish I would have spread the links because we get censored out of existence.
[02:06:52.916 --> 02:06:54.696]  But right now, you've come through.
[02:06:54.696 --> 02:06:55.517]  We're still here.
[02:06:55.517 --> 02:07:02.220]  We're on air ten hours a day minimum, six days a week, most times seven days a week now.
[02:07:02.220 --> 02:07:04.261]  So it's all thanks to your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:07:04.261 --> 02:07:07.403]  Big specials happening at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:07:07.403 --> 02:07:09.644]  So go to InfoWarsStore.com and check that out.
[02:07:10.419 --> 02:07:12.521]  Uh, while it's still available.
[02:07:12.521 --> 02:07:14.622]  Alright, do we have a call screen?
[02:07:14.622 --> 02:07:15.563]  Like, what's going on guys?
[02:07:15.563 --> 02:07:21.147]  I still don't have a caller board over here.
[02:07:21.147 --> 02:07:23.589]  Okay.
[02:07:23.589 --> 02:07:25.530]  Okay, got you, got you.
[02:07:25.530 --> 02:07:27.672]  Alright, well that's just fine.
[02:07:27.672 --> 02:07:29.433]  Okay, there it is.
[02:07:29.433 --> 02:07:32.975]  Sorry guys, no, I sprung this on the crew last minute.
[02:07:32.975 --> 02:07:34.056]  They weren't prepared for this.
[02:07:34.056 --> 02:07:35.437]  Nobody's bad here.
[02:07:35.437 --> 02:07:36.998]  Uh, we're just live.
[02:07:36.998 --> 02:07:37.939]  We don't script anything.
[02:07:37.939 --> 02:07:39.300]  It's totally from the seat of our pants.
[02:07:40.200 --> 02:07:40.600]  How's it going?
[02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:41.361]  Glad to see you.
[02:08:09.091 --> 02:08:14.255]  I'm a long-time listener, 24-hour streamer of The Infowar.
[02:08:14.255 --> 02:08:18.638]  Anyway, it's getting real hard and real difficult to stream you guys.
[02:08:18.638 --> 02:08:20.379]  Censorship has been going wild.
[02:08:20.379 --> 02:08:25.403]  They've been messing with audio feeds out of this thing, and whatnot.
[02:08:25.403 --> 02:08:27.104]  It's been pretty hard.
[02:08:27.104 --> 02:08:30.727]  People ask me why I do it, and I'll tell you why.
[02:08:30.727 --> 02:08:33.028]  It's because of your great products, guys.
[02:08:33.028 --> 02:08:35.390]  You've literally saved my life.
[02:08:35.390 --> 02:08:37.732]  The X2 opened my mind up.
[02:08:38.442 --> 02:08:42.305]  Cleared me up more spiritually, and I gotta thank you for it.
[02:08:42.305 --> 02:08:51.951]  Anyway, I know you got a lot of other callers, and if you'd like to catch me, I'm over on Bear's Place, over on Twitch, 24-7, where I try to be.
[02:08:51.951 --> 02:08:54.733]  Y'all have a good night, and we'll talk at you later.
[02:08:54.733 --> 02:08:55.873]  Thanks.
[02:08:55.873 --> 02:08:57.494]  Thank you, Bear.
[02:08:57.494 --> 02:09:03.358]  And you know, uh, look, I gotta be honest, you know, I stream InfoWars as well, in the morning, the American Journal with Harrison Smith.
[02:09:03.358 --> 02:09:07.801]  If I'm not hosting the Alex Jones Show, the Alex Jones Show, and then obviously, you know, my show, and friends and family tune in.
[02:09:09.859 --> 02:09:11.320]  I mean, I don't want to make a big fuss of it.
[02:09:11.320 --> 02:09:12.660]  People understand we're under attack.
[02:09:12.660 --> 02:09:14.060]  We have to build our own infrastructure.
[02:09:14.060 --> 02:09:23.003]  So, but, um, you know, I'm well aware of the technical glitches and believe me, it frustrates me just as much as you.
[02:09:23.003 --> 02:09:26.785]  And so I don't really know what else to say or do about it.
[02:09:26.785 --> 02:09:34.307]  I mean, believe me, it's a pet peeve of mine too.
[02:09:34.307 --> 02:09:34.527]  And, um,
[02:09:38.297 --> 02:09:39.458]  I mean, I would just say this.
[02:09:39.458 --> 02:09:42.280]  How about this?
[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:45.742]  I will open up my email.
[02:09:45.742 --> 02:09:48.603]  Because, believe me folks, I want these things taken care of.
[02:09:48.603 --> 02:09:49.804]  I'm not a tech guy.
[02:09:49.804 --> 02:09:54.067]  I don't deal with the IT department here.
[02:09:54.067 --> 02:09:55.548]  And they're great guys.
[02:09:55.548 --> 02:09:57.109]  I don't know what it is that they deal with.
[02:09:57.109 --> 02:09:59.130]  I don't know why, you know, you're having these problems.
[02:09:59.130 --> 02:10:00.291]  But believe me, I hear your complaints.
[02:10:00.291 --> 02:10:01.912]  But I'll tell you what.
[02:10:01.912 --> 02:10:03.192]  We need to do something about it.
[02:10:03.192 --> 02:10:03.873]  We want to be better.
[02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:08.922]  I will open up my email, owens at infowars.com.
[02:10:08.922 --> 02:10:17.927]  Send me all of your technical glitches and I will forward those to the IT team and we'll see if they can do anything about it.
[02:10:17.927 --> 02:10:22.129]  Again, we're under all kinds of attack here beyond just the censorship.
[02:10:22.129 --> 02:10:23.250]  I'm not an IT guy.
[02:10:23.250 --> 02:10:24.911]  I don't work with the IT department.
[02:10:25.558 --> 02:10:32.041]  But, believe me, I get frustrated when you see some of the glitches that are ongoing and they seem to never be fixed.
[02:10:32.041 --> 02:10:33.701]  So, you know what?
[02:10:33.701 --> 02:10:35.142]  We'll work on that.
[02:10:35.142 --> 02:10:35.922]  We'll work on that.
[02:10:35.922 --> 02:10:41.524]  Send me any glitches you have to Owens at InfoWars.com.
[02:10:41.524 --> 02:10:43.805]  Owens at InfoWars.com.
[02:10:43.805 --> 02:10:46.186]  I'll forward those to the IT team here.
[02:10:46.186 --> 02:10:48.987]  Maybe we can get some of this stuff figured out.
[02:10:48.987 --> 02:10:51.728]  My enemies are your enemies.
[02:10:51.728 --> 02:10:52.749]  They're the globalists.
[02:10:52.749 --> 02:10:53.469]  They're the exterminists.
[02:10:54.298 --> 02:11:21.825]  They're a consortium of mad scientists, pedophiles, control freaks, devil whispers, vampires, whatever you want to call them, that are highly predatory, that are setting up a false fantasy land system of constant bombardment of propaganda, drugs, and electromagnetic radiation to change the very DNA of the human species, to mutate us into a form that they can control like a pawn on a chessboard.
[02:11:23.143 --> 02:11:30.447]  The bottom line is they want to play God, they are playing God, and the noose is only going to tighten around our necks from here on out.
[02:11:30.447 --> 02:11:47.718]  So many other people want to be positive, they want to put out fake news, and want to only cover limited amounts of what's happening with the new world order, but at the end of the day, it's all about depopulation, it's all about world government, it's all about the end of the human system as we know it, and all its ashes, a nightmare being built, only admitting it can turn it around and stop it.
[02:11:48.448 --> 02:11:52.631]  Alex Jones here with the new Infowars sale and it is a fantastic sale.
[02:11:52.631 --> 02:11:56.695]  It is many of our best-selling products that just so happen to also be selling out.
[02:11:56.695 --> 02:12:02.299]  But despite that, they're 50% off and free shipping on these select items.
[02:12:02.299 --> 02:12:03.460]  Again, all these are selling out.
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:07.102]  Except for Rainforest, it finally came back into stock.
[02:12:07.102 --> 02:12:07.862]  It's amazing.
[02:12:07.862 --> 02:12:09.803]  It's 50% off and free shipping.
[02:12:09.803 --> 02:12:14.306]  We've got the Toothpaste, the Mouthwash, the Cava Chill, the Vazo Beats, the Alpha Power.
[02:12:14.306 --> 02:12:15.967]  All of these are best sellers.
[02:12:15.967 --> 02:12:20.630]  50% off and free shipping at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:12:21.710 --> 02:12:22.231]  Or 888-253-3139.
[02:12:22.231 --> 02:12:25.854]  And it funds our operation.
[02:12:25.854 --> 02:12:27.756]  Plus, all of the Emmerich's Essentials.
[02:12:27.756 --> 02:12:32.660]  Essential oils, natural deodorants, shampoos, conditioners, a whole host of products.
[02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:35.503]  The entire Emmerich's Essentials line is close to selling out.
[02:12:35.503 --> 02:12:36.664]  We're coming in a few months.
[02:12:36.664 --> 02:12:42.429]  But despite that, right now, ladies and gentlemen, they're all 50% off as well, with free shipping.
[02:12:42.429 --> 02:12:44.211]  Just follow the banners at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:12:44.211 --> 02:12:46.593]  It's a huge savings, and it funds the Info War.
[02:12:46.593 --> 02:12:46.753]  A 360 win.
[02:12:51.574 --> 02:12:55.956]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:12:55.956 --> 02:13:05.479]  Alright, we're going to take a bunch of phone calls here and then Alex Jones is going to be joining us.
[02:13:05.479 --> 02:13:06.699]  A couple of breaking news stories.
[02:13:06.699 --> 02:13:11.701]  We have another white supremacist attack on an Asian man.
[02:13:11.701 --> 02:13:16.583]  Guys, you want to get the white supremacist here who attacked an Asian man on the subway in New York.
[02:13:16.583 --> 02:13:18.643]  Can we get a shot here of the white supremacist that did that?
[02:13:18.643 --> 02:13:20.084]  Yes, thank you.
[02:13:20.084 --> 02:13:20.744]  There he goes.
[02:13:21.688 --> 02:13:24.369]  Awfully black skin for a white supremacist there.
[02:13:24.369 --> 02:13:28.890]  So yet another white supremacist attack on an Asian man on the subway, so that's good.
[02:13:28.890 --> 02:13:42.934]  Medical Examiner, that nice lady that died after the COVID vaccine, Medical Examiner says, no, it was not the vaccine, but my crew was reading the story during the break, they still don't know the cause of death though.
[02:13:42.934 --> 02:13:45.895]  So they don't know the cause of death, they just know it wasn't the vaccine.
[02:13:47.260 --> 02:13:49.822]  That's not how that works.
[02:13:49.822 --> 02:13:50.963]  It was the vaccine.
[02:13:50.963 --> 02:13:52.525]  You're not going to fool anybody.
[02:13:52.525 --> 02:13:54.766]  Hey, but you'll get a free donut if you take a vaccine.
[02:13:54.766 --> 02:13:56.828]  So, you know, go get a free donut.
[02:13:56.828 --> 02:13:58.409]  We go back out to the phone lines.
[02:13:58.409 --> 02:14:01.792]  Jesse calling in from Missouri on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:14:01.792 --> 02:14:05.155]  Go ahead.
[02:14:05.155 --> 02:14:09.678]  Been dying to talk to you since your Sunday show yesterday.
[02:14:09.678 --> 02:14:10.379]  Well, you got through.
[02:14:10.379 --> 02:14:12.561]  Yeah, I did.
[02:14:12.561 --> 02:14:16.404]  I said a little prayer and then you turned the phones on, so that made that happen.
[02:14:17.253 --> 02:14:24.257]  So, if I'm not discounting what you're saying at all, I totally agree there's probably millions of people pouring across the border right now.
[02:14:24.257 --> 02:14:30.120]  Would it be possible to send a crew out, an Infra Wars crew out to video that and catch that happening?
[02:14:30.120 --> 02:14:31.360]  Yeah, here's the problem.
[02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:32.821]  They'd bust it wide open.
[02:14:32.821 --> 02:14:33.441]  Here's the problem.
[02:14:33.441 --> 02:14:36.963]  We basically are down to three reporters.
[02:14:36.963 --> 02:14:39.084]  And we're all on air three hours a day.
[02:14:39.084 --> 02:14:41.926]  So, we're trying to expand.
[02:14:41.926 --> 02:14:43.807]  We're kind of at max capacity right now.
[02:14:44.874 --> 02:14:51.764]  I mean, if we had like a flood of cash come in at Infowarsstore.com, like, I mean, a flood of cash, then maybe we could hire another reporter.
[02:14:51.764 --> 02:14:58.433]  We just don't have the capital and all of our reporters are on air, in studio, every day.
[02:14:58.433 --> 02:15:00.696]  So, it's kind of a frustration.
[02:15:03.908 --> 02:15:08.872]  You know, and Alex is having to do a lot of things outside of the studio, handling a lot of work issues.
[02:15:08.872 --> 02:15:09.933]  I mean, that's part of the problem, too.
[02:15:09.933 --> 02:15:14.657]  The number one voice on air here is also the business manager and, I mean, everything.
[02:15:14.657 --> 02:15:16.659]  The technical director, the strategist, everything.
[02:15:16.659 --> 02:15:21.943]  So it's like, so when he goes out, then I have to fill in and then we have the depth chart rotation and everything.
[02:15:21.943 --> 02:15:30.010]  So the good news is, whether or not there's an official representative InfoWars down at the border or at the event coming up on Friday,
[02:15:31.301 --> 02:15:33.163]  A lot of these people are in touch with me.
[02:15:33.163 --> 02:15:34.143]  They're sending me intel.
[02:15:34.143 --> 02:15:35.384]  They're sending me news reports.
[02:15:35.384 --> 02:15:37.926]  So, we'll at least have access to what's going on.
[02:15:37.926 --> 02:15:42.409]  But as far as a reporter being down there, we just literally don't have one.
[02:15:42.409 --> 02:15:46.012]  So, you know, I can't be in two places at once.
[02:15:46.012 --> 02:15:46.832]  But we'll see.
[02:15:46.832 --> 02:15:48.273]  We're going to try to cover it.
[02:15:48.273 --> 02:15:51.936]  The good news is, again though, you've got other people to go out there and do it.
[02:15:51.936 --> 02:15:53.337]  I mean, Fox News is covering it.
[02:15:53.337 --> 02:15:54.618]  It's pretty much the only one.
[02:15:54.618 --> 02:15:58.281]  But even NBC News and people sent out there and they're like, they talked to the illegal immigrants.
[02:15:58.281 --> 02:15:59.581]  They're like, yeah, we're coming here for Biden.
[02:15:59.581 --> 02:15:59.962]  So, I mean,
[02:16:00.522 --> 02:16:03.484]  It's not a complete necessity that InfoWars is there right now.
[02:16:03.484 --> 02:16:05.985]  That's why we're not, because other people are.
[02:16:05.985 --> 02:16:10.268]  But maybe we'll have a presence there.
[02:16:10.268 --> 02:16:15.751]  Yeah, I know you guys have done it before in the past, so that was my thought on it.
[02:16:15.751 --> 02:16:20.314]  Yeah, and of course it was Joe Biggs who used to work here, who went down to the border.
[02:16:20.314 --> 02:16:22.155]  This is when we had like five reporters.
[02:16:23.272 --> 02:16:24.453]  We're down to basically none.
[02:16:24.453 --> 02:16:25.213]  Just show hosts now.
[02:16:25.213 --> 02:16:28.115]  I mean, I do field reports, but I'm on air every day.
[02:16:28.115 --> 02:16:30.437]  I have to fill in for the Alex Jones Show when he's out.
[02:16:30.437 --> 02:16:32.058]  So, I mean, it's just impossible.
[02:16:32.058 --> 02:16:33.999]  But yeah, we sent Joe Biggs down there.
[02:16:33.999 --> 02:16:35.940]  He was down at the border for a couple hours.
[02:16:35.940 --> 02:16:39.883]  Caught smugglers, drug smugglers, all kinds of illegal border crossings.
[02:16:39.883 --> 02:16:41.564]  Laura Logan goes down there for Fox News.
[02:16:41.564 --> 02:16:43.525]  There's gunfights every night.
[02:16:43.525 --> 02:16:48.388]  By the way, Joe Biggs is a political prisoner of the Democrat Party right now.
[02:16:50.894 --> 02:16:55.083]  As well as other veterans and friends and family of Info Wars.
[02:16:55.083 --> 02:16:57.408]  I don't even want to go too off into it.
[02:16:57.408 --> 02:16:58.470]  It's kind of emotional, but...
[02:17:00.310 --> 02:17:05.191]  You know, just, folks, it's not good, the treatment that we're getting right now to our veterans.
[02:17:05.191 --> 02:17:06.232]  I mean, look at this.
[02:17:06.232 --> 02:17:17.135]  The veterans are sleeping in the halls of the Capitol building and in parking garages, but they've just earmarked $86 million for illegal immigrants to get into $400-a-night hotels.
[02:17:17.135 --> 02:17:20.956]  I mean, the Biden administration is taking a shit on our military.
[02:17:20.956 --> 02:17:21.896]  It's disgusting!
[02:17:23.664 --> 02:17:28.888]  And they swore to protect this country from enemies foreign and domestic, and that's why the Democrats are pissed.
[02:17:28.888 --> 02:17:34.373]  Their enemy's domestic, we all know it, the veterans know it, and their time is coming, man!
[02:17:34.373 --> 02:17:35.494]  Sorry, I'm not trying to yell.
[02:17:35.494 --> 02:17:37.175]  Jesse, thank you for the call.
[02:17:37.175 --> 02:17:39.718]  Let's go to... Let's see what I want to do here.
[02:17:39.718 --> 02:17:42.280]  Man, oh man.
[02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:43.040]  Man, oh man.
[02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:44.842]  Let's go to Smokey in Virginia.
[02:17:44.842 --> 02:17:45.983]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:17:45.983 --> 02:17:47.984]  Smokey, go ahead.
[02:17:47.984 --> 02:17:49.065]  Howdy, howdy, Owen.
[02:17:49.065 --> 02:17:49.746]  Yeah, look, man.
[02:17:50.356 --> 02:18:02.030]  So I used to work for local government, and I had a co worker who still is he's well he, I guess he's still working for him so he called me about two weeks ago and he was like, hey, you know, the county.
[02:18:02.574 --> 02:18:23.222]  Pretty much forcing all the employees to get vaccinated and so he took the vaccine and then not not even 48 hours later he had a catastrophic major stroke that left the left side of his body paralyzed and he left the the remaining side which which he says full use of he's got such bad tremors in
[02:18:23.908 --> 02:18:25.890]  Hey man, this guy was the breadwinner in his family.
[02:18:25.890 --> 02:18:27.531]  He was the one paying the bills.
[02:18:27.531 --> 02:18:31.995]  You know, in the county, they're not going to recognize the fact that the vaccine did this to him.
[02:18:31.995 --> 02:18:33.196]  You know what I mean?
[02:18:33.196 --> 02:18:40.942]  And nobody ever is held liable, so he got Bell's Palsy, he's numb on his left side, what's going on now?
[02:18:40.942 --> 02:18:46.787]  Man, this guy, he was as strong as an ox, dude.
[02:18:48.202 --> 02:18:54.684]  Just right before he did this, I saw him, we went to the range, had a good time.
[02:18:54.684 --> 02:18:58.424]  I mean, he was fine and dandy, and now, you know, he can't walk.
[02:18:58.424 --> 02:19:10.687]  This guy can't walk, he can't even hold a cup without spilling it all over himself because the tremors are so bad, and half of his body's paralyzed.
[02:19:10.687 --> 02:19:13.668]  Hey, but he can get a free donut from Krispy Kreme!
[02:19:15.791 --> 02:19:21.033]  And what they're doing, what these globalists are doing, is they're killing us slowly.
[02:19:21.033 --> 02:19:31.918]  They're killing us softly with this inoculation and, you know, they have total hands-off, no legal repercussions.
[02:19:31.918 --> 02:19:32.918]  Because they own us!
[02:19:32.918 --> 02:19:37.140]  I mean, what is it going to take for people to realize that they're property of a global government?
[02:19:37.140 --> 02:19:39.320]  They're property of a medical tyranny?
[02:19:39.320 --> 02:19:44.883]  I mean, if this forced vaccination that can kill you isn't enough, I don't know what it's going to take.
[02:19:44.883 --> 02:19:45.343]  I don't think...
[02:19:46.121 --> 02:19:55.293]  I am losing, I'm seriously losing hope because not enough people are standing up for their religious freedoms and saying no to this vaccine.
[02:19:55.293 --> 02:20:00.820]  Well now you see why they removed God from schools years ago.
[02:20:00.820 --> 02:20:01.381]  It's awful.
[02:20:01.381 --> 02:20:02.723]  Thank you for taking my call, Owen.
[02:20:02.723 --> 02:20:03.364]  God bless you, bud.
[02:20:03.866 --> 02:20:04.587]  Thank you.
[02:20:04.587 --> 02:20:09.310]  Folks, look, we do whole shows where we ask people like that to call in, but we don't even have to ask, man.
[02:20:09.310 --> 02:20:10.371]  They'll call in all the time.
[02:20:10.371 --> 02:20:16.955]  So, I mean, just here on the show alone, we've had hundreds of people call in talking about negative side effects to their friends or family.
[02:20:16.955 --> 02:20:20.398]  I mean, they even admit, I mean, I covered the Bloomberg story.
[02:20:20.398 --> 02:20:21.418]  They even admit mainstream news.
[02:20:21.418 --> 02:20:22.739]  This is not a vaccine.
[02:20:22.739 --> 02:20:24.420]  It's brand new experimental technology.
[02:20:24.420 --> 02:20:26.742]  We won't know the real side effects till years down the road.
[02:20:26.742 --> 02:20:29.804]  But hey, take it anyway for a virus that you're 99.9% likely to survive, even if you catch it.
[02:20:34.565 --> 02:20:37.069]  I mean, we're all slaves on this planet, man.
[02:20:37.069 --> 02:20:37.549]  Unbelievable.
[02:20:37.549 --> 02:20:39.552]  People don't want to accept the facts.
[02:20:39.552 --> 02:20:41.455]  They don't want to look at the reality in the face.
[02:20:41.455 --> 02:20:44.620]  Let's go to BOM in Brooklyn.
[02:20:44.620 --> 02:20:45.942]  Quickly, you got 60 seconds.
[02:20:45.942 --> 02:20:46.703]  BOM, go ahead.
[02:20:48.749 --> 02:20:54.530]  Yeah, Owen, just really quick, the scenario with the Meghan Markle thing.
[02:20:54.530 --> 02:21:05.273]  I kind of saw that scenario as something that they wanted to try to get ahead of this whole diversity thing because, of course, as you know, they don't have a very good reputation.
[02:21:05.273 --> 02:21:11.434]  Mostly anybody who knows about the royals knows somewhat of their history.
[02:21:11.434 --> 02:21:14.575]  And so, in order to kind of save face, they kind of jumped ahead and
[02:21:15.015 --> 02:21:20.319]  I feel like this is really outside of everything and that Meghan and Harry are running their own shenanigans right now.
[02:21:20.319 --> 02:21:22.020]  Maybe even blackmailing the Royal Family.
[02:21:22.020 --> 02:21:23.822]  I mean, it's just totally out of control.
[02:21:23.822 --> 02:21:24.382]  Hey, I don't care!
[02:21:24.382 --> 02:21:27.284]  Let the Royal Family collapse to a briefcase model.
[02:21:27.284 --> 02:21:28.825]  That'll be the funniest thing in world history!
[02:21:47.828 --> 02:21:55.176]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and full wars I've had.
[02:21:55.176 --> 02:21:58.460]  If you're paying attention, you know we've done together.
[02:21:58.460 --> 02:22:07.590]  But I'll tell you this, the technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[02:22:08.425 --> 02:22:10.806]  They're trying to shudder and silence the human resistance.
[02:22:10.806 --> 02:22:16.430]  So, now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[02:22:16.430 --> 02:22:19.591]  Everything you warned your friends and family about is going to be true.
[02:22:19.591 --> 02:22:22.353]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[02:22:22.353 --> 02:22:26.495]  The power structures are to silence those of us that they can.
[02:22:26.495 --> 02:22:31.338]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[02:22:31.338 --> 02:22:33.059]  We have the power.
[02:22:33.059 --> 02:22:36.381]  But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[02:22:37.370 --> 02:22:42.956]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come.
[02:22:42.956 --> 02:22:48.822]  So be the Paul Revere as you are.
[02:22:48.822 --> 02:22:52.566]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[02:22:52.566 --> 02:22:56.290]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[02:22:56.290 --> 02:22:58.873]  But let me tell you, the New World Order's breathing down our neck.
[02:22:59.531 --> 02:23:03.912]  The big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[02:23:03.912 --> 02:23:09.673]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local states you're listening to as well.
[02:23:09.673 --> 02:23:21.256]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[02:23:21.876 --> 02:23:24.016]  I need your help more than ever now.
[02:23:24.016 --> 02:23:28.137]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[02:23:28.137 --> 02:23:38.739]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:23:38.739 --> 02:23:48.281]  Whether it's high quality coffee, or supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[02:23:48.281 --> 02:23:48.921]  Thank you so much.
[02:23:49.541 --> 02:23:57.609]  As you know, we're always upping our game at InfoWars, and we've brought you a new supplement, a new product that we know you're gonna love, especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[02:23:57.609 --> 02:23:58.690]  It is Down-N-Out.
[02:23:58.690 --> 02:24:00.511]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[02:24:00.511 --> 02:24:03.494]  We mean down your bed, sleeping hard throughout the night.
[02:24:03.494 --> 02:24:06.557]  It's got 4 milligrams of high-quality melatonin.
[02:24:06.557 --> 02:24:09.119]  It's got 25 milligrams of passionflower.
[02:24:09.119 --> 02:24:12.782]  It's got 50 milligrams of valerian root extract concentrate.
[02:24:12.782 --> 02:24:14.624]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm.
[02:24:15.124 --> 02:24:17.765]  And 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[02:24:17.765 --> 02:24:20.366]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[02:24:20.366 --> 02:24:23.427]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[02:24:23.427 --> 02:24:25.408]  It's liquid, so it goes right into your body fast.
[02:24:25.408 --> 02:24:28.309]  If you take it subliminally under the tongue, oh!
[02:24:28.309 --> 02:24:29.589]  Talk about blasting off to sleep.
[02:24:29.589 --> 02:24:30.290]  It's incredible.
[02:24:30.290 --> 02:24:32.810]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[02:24:32.810 --> 02:24:35.291]  It's so popular, we can't keep it in stock.

[02:24:43.118 --> 02:24:51.204]  The people are awakening.
[02:24:51.204 --> 02:24:53.925]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[02:24:53.925 --> 02:24:55.987]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[02:24:55.987 --> 02:24:58.348]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[02:24:58.348 --> 02:25:07.695]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai Coms especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data.
[02:25:07.975 --> 02:25:16.557]  To be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data, they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[02:25:16.557 --> 02:25:23.279]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[02:25:23.279 --> 02:25:24.699]  In their own words, they admit it.
[02:25:24.699 --> 02:25:29.140]  So, I've been selling privacy pouches and blocket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[02:25:29.620 --> 02:25:31.561]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[02:25:31.561 --> 02:25:32.641]  They're Faraday cages.
[02:25:32.641 --> 02:25:34.342]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[02:25:34.342 --> 02:25:36.342]  They work absolutely great.
[02:25:36.342 --> 02:25:45.465]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother to know what you're up to because it's none of their business.
[02:25:45.465 --> 02:25:51.587]  Get yours at InfowarsStore.com today.
[02:25:51.587 --> 02:25:54.208]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:26:01.861 --> 02:26:03.561]  Big Brother.
[02:26:03.561 --> 02:26:05.902]  Mainstream media.
[02:26:05.902 --> 02:26:07.662]  Government cover-ups.
[02:26:07.662 --> 02:26:09.743]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:26:09.743 --> 02:26:11.903]  Well, so does he.
[02:26:11.903 --> 02:26:20.785]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:26:20.785 --> 02:26:29.987]  And we are now going to have Alex into the Alex Jones Show on this Live Monday Transmission.
[02:26:29.987 --> 02:26:30.767]  You'd think before I got
[02:26:31.846 --> 02:26:37.347]  Live here on air, I would comb what's left of my hair, but now there I am getting that done.
[02:26:37.347 --> 02:26:39.688]  Thank you to all the TV viewers, all the radio listeners for tuning in today.
[02:26:39.688 --> 02:26:44.129]  Owen Schroer has been doing a kick-buck job hosting today.
[02:26:44.129 --> 02:26:53.971]  I am here on the East Coast of the United States on a very important mission, and I will have a special report for you by tomorrow.
[02:26:53.971 --> 02:27:01.393]  We will be premiering here on the broadcast, and I will be back in Austin, Texas about the second hour of the show tomorrow.
[02:27:02.555 --> 02:27:08.436]  But really, just pulling back from this, more and more I realize that the 35,000 foot view, the 100,000 foot view is the most important.
[02:27:08.436 --> 02:27:15.377]  Because if you pull back and see the whole thing, you understand it's a globalist, worldwide takeover of every sovereign nation.
[02:27:15.377 --> 02:27:30.600]  But if you're going to take down a nation, if you can take down the greatest country in the history of the world, hands down we've been at it for 200 plus years, if you can do that and kill the idea, the dream of America, then you can bring in your global tyranny.
[02:27:30.600 --> 02:27:30.940]  And so,
[02:27:31.975 --> 02:27:35.677]  I'm just seeing a ultra-massive awakening happening.
[02:27:35.677 --> 02:27:46.962]  You know, they've got all their racial distractions and they've got all their infighting and their war of the sexes, but at the end of the day, that's big megacorporations that want to consolidate control who are involved in divide and conquer.
[02:27:46.962 --> 02:27:50.063]  And so I see what's unfolding on this planet.
[02:27:50.063 --> 02:27:53.364]  I see the tyranny of the globalists as a sign of their weakness.
[02:27:53.364 --> 02:27:58.246]  It doesn't mean that they aren't on the offense.
[02:27:58.246 --> 02:27:59.607]  It doesn't mean that we're not in trouble.
[02:28:00.495 --> 02:28:08.457]  But at the end of the day, these are the actions of desperate individuals, and there is a massive sea change happening.
[02:28:08.457 --> 02:28:21.360]  I'm a well-known prominent person, which has its negatives and its positives, but I get to, like a sensor, like an engine sensor, I get to experience things the general public doesn't.
[02:28:21.360 --> 02:28:24.941]  So if you're into liberty, if you're into freedom, you feel alone.
[02:28:24.941 --> 02:28:30.002]  I mean, I know that when I'm around people that, you know, aren't patriots, I do as well.
[02:28:30.620 --> 02:28:41.605]  But when you become more prominent, you get to interface with people, and it blows you away with the actual numbers of people that are totally awake, and the numbers of people that are partially awake.
[02:28:41.605 --> 02:28:45.346]  And those are on the partial road to waking up, to being woken up basically fully.
[02:28:45.346 --> 02:28:49.768]  In other words, nobody's fully awake but God, but you're on the process of becoming more awake each day.
[02:28:49.768 --> 02:28:57.511]  So, it's really hit me the last few weeks, or the last month, that I don't want to apologize unless it's all a process.
[02:28:57.511 --> 02:28:59.692]  I got really depressed when they stole the election from Trump.
[02:29:00.821 --> 02:29:25.383]  Even though I've been eating less and and even exercising I gained like 30 pounds just from cortisoid stress hormones that your body releases and You know just the last year, you know My beard's basically almost gone gray and it's because the weight of knowing we're right the weight of knowing this is a satanic takeover the weight of understanding as a man, I get really upset with myself and I'm never satisfied and
[02:29:27.128 --> 02:29:40.937]  Thinking it's my fault, but God literally just told me, he said, you've got to just do the right thing, but be cheerful, be positive, and tell others to be cheerful, and others to be positive, because God's real, and God's promises are real, and the gift of consciousness is amazing.
[02:29:40.937 --> 02:29:42.418]  Of course, there's evil in the universe.
[02:29:42.418 --> 02:29:49.442]  That's the nature of free will, but we've just got, and when I point my finger at you folks, like I always say, three fingers are pointing right back at me.
[02:29:49.442 --> 02:29:50.743]  I'm preaching it myself.
[02:29:50.743 --> 02:29:52.804]  We need to be positive.
[02:29:52.804 --> 02:29:54.445]  We need to be happy.
[02:29:54.445 --> 02:29:55.346]  We need to be thankful.
[02:29:55.928 --> 02:30:01.955]  We need to be appreciative of our family and our friends and our neighbors and stand up for them against tyranny.
[02:30:01.955 --> 02:30:07.261]  And not be selfish and let this get to us and feel like we are totally to blame.
[02:30:07.261 --> 02:30:07.861]  And that may sound weird.
[02:30:07.861 --> 02:30:08.562]  What do you mean?
[02:30:08.562 --> 02:30:10.224]  Don't be selfish.
[02:30:10.224 --> 02:30:12.847]  Don't say I'm not totally to blame or you're not totally to blame.
[02:30:12.847 --> 02:30:14.589]  Yeah, that's still selfish.
[02:30:14.589 --> 02:30:16.211]  That's putting ourselves in front of God.
[02:30:17.139 --> 02:30:19.520]  That I feel like I could defeat this new world order.
[02:30:19.520 --> 02:30:30.265]  If I just worked more hours, or if I just did more videos, if I wrote more articles, or if I just did more and didn't spend time with my family, well you know it's worth it because I've told myself this before and I'm working at like 2 a.m.
[02:30:30.265 --> 02:30:31.645]  I haven't seen my children in two days.
[02:30:31.645 --> 02:30:32.746]  I'm like, you're being a bad dad.
[02:30:32.746 --> 02:30:33.566]  Doesn't matter.
[02:30:33.566 --> 02:30:35.067]  They won't have a future if I don't do this.
[02:30:35.067 --> 02:30:39.369]  But at the end of the day, we won't have a future if we don't spend time with our children at the same time.
[02:30:39.369 --> 02:30:42.150]  So we got to do it all basically and then give it to God.
[02:30:42.150 --> 02:30:43.250]  We go as hard as we can.
[02:30:43.250 --> 02:30:44.151]  We're strong as we can.
[02:30:45.643 --> 02:30:52.908]  Well, we've got to give it to God because everything about the enemy is depressing us and making us upset and feeling ugly and feeling bad.
[02:30:52.908 --> 02:30:59.252]  When we were made by God, we've got to rejoice in God, worship God, and worship means connect to God.
[02:30:59.252 --> 02:31:00.433]  It's not just bow down.
[02:31:00.433 --> 02:31:01.494]  You're just in God's presence.
[02:31:01.494 --> 02:31:02.094]  It's so strong.
[02:31:02.094 --> 02:31:05.697]  You get on your knees because the whole universe opens up and it's intense.
[02:31:05.697 --> 02:31:07.198]  You're actually hiding from it.
[02:31:07.198 --> 02:31:07.858]  It's so big.
[02:31:07.858 --> 02:31:11.180]  It pushes you down like weights of gravity, good gravity.
[02:31:11.180 --> 02:31:12.121]  It makes you cry.
[02:31:13.917 --> 02:31:19.700]  But at the same time, we can't be arrogant enough at a subconscious level, because it doesn't seem like arrogance.
[02:31:19.700 --> 02:31:20.600]  I've got to beat this.
[02:31:20.600 --> 02:31:21.600]  I've got to fight this.
[02:31:21.600 --> 02:31:22.661]  I've got to win.
[02:31:22.661 --> 02:31:24.402]  I've got to be the strongest.
[02:31:24.402 --> 02:31:25.622]  I'm not doing enough.
[02:31:25.622 --> 02:31:29.164]  No, you do as much as you can, and then God's going to carry you the rest of the way.
[02:31:29.164 --> 02:31:30.484]  That's what faith is really all about.
[02:31:30.484 --> 02:31:34.486]  So, I've got a lot of news to cover here in these final couple of segments for the next guest host.
[02:31:34.486 --> 02:31:37.227]  It takes over Paul Joseph Watson's tomorrow.
[02:31:37.227 --> 02:31:39.628]  This is the great Gerald Cilente today.
[02:31:42.034 --> 02:31:43.215]  Again, I'm persecuted.
[02:31:43.215 --> 02:31:43.716]  I'm attacked.
[02:31:43.716 --> 02:31:44.416]  That's a positive.
[02:31:44.416 --> 02:31:47.839]  Christ said, rejoice because you're being persecuted in my name.
[02:31:47.839 --> 02:31:49.280]  And again, I'm not a priest.
[02:31:49.280 --> 02:31:50.001]  I'm not a preacher.
[02:31:50.001 --> 02:31:51.262]  I'm not a Pharisee.
[02:31:51.262 --> 02:31:53.664]  I'm not on a high horse telling you how good I am or how perfect I am.
[02:31:53.664 --> 02:31:54.985]  I'm the opposite.
[02:31:54.985 --> 02:31:56.366]  People say, well, why are you so religious?
[02:31:56.366 --> 02:31:57.247]  Why are you so Christian?
[02:31:57.247 --> 02:31:58.048]  I've always been a Christian.
[02:31:58.672 --> 02:32:12.777]  But as I get deeper into the fight against the New World Order, as world governments announce, as the Mark of the Beast is announced, as they openly come for our children, as they openly promote Satanism at every major music and sporting event that's national, we are in a fight against good versus evil.
[02:32:12.777 --> 02:32:14.437]  And it turns out the Bible's real!
[02:32:14.437 --> 02:32:15.438]  And it's all true!
[02:32:15.438 --> 02:32:17.659]  And God wouldn't give us a cheat sheet.
[02:32:17.659 --> 02:32:20.560]  God gave us free will, but also gave us a cheat sheet.
[02:32:20.560 --> 02:32:22.860]  So that, hey, I'm not just going to give you free will.
[02:32:22.860 --> 02:32:23.761]  I'm going to cheat a little.
[02:32:23.761 --> 02:32:25.361]  I'm not saying God cheated, but you know what I mean.
[02:32:25.361 --> 02:32:27.342]  I'm going to give you the enemy playbook, and I'm going to warn you
[02:32:28.317 --> 02:32:31.539]  Because I'm not going to send you into this war without some training.
[02:32:31.539 --> 02:32:39.465]  And so that's all I'm telling people is, if you don't feel fulfilled, if you don't feel empowered, if things don't make sense, it's because you are trying to fix it all yourself.
[02:32:39.465 --> 02:32:41.446]  The atheists tell you, oh, it's only us.
[02:32:41.446 --> 02:32:43.648]  Your dog or cat doesn't really love you.
[02:32:43.648 --> 02:32:45.749]  It's anthropomorphizing things.
[02:32:45.749 --> 02:32:46.550]  No, it does love you.
[02:32:46.550 --> 02:32:47.451]  And all the studies show it.
[02:32:47.451 --> 02:32:48.952]  It releases endorphins too.
[02:32:48.952 --> 02:32:49.932]  And humans love you.
[02:32:49.932 --> 02:32:50.733]  We all love each other.
[02:32:50.733 --> 02:32:52.114]  And there's love on this planet.
[02:32:52.114 --> 02:32:54.295]  We need to magnify that and promote that.
[02:32:54.295 --> 02:32:56.537]  Not be overly fake positive where we ignore the evil.
[02:32:56.537 --> 02:32:57.538]  No, we need to promote good.
[02:32:58.119 --> 02:32:58.380]  Thank you.
[02:33:03.717 --> 02:33:09.160]  Since the fake election in January 6th, you and I, I think, were both really negative.
[02:33:09.160 --> 02:33:12.362]  You've been positive a lot as well, but we were both at each other's throats.
[02:33:12.362 --> 02:33:13.843]  I've known you five, six years.
[02:33:13.843 --> 02:33:14.923]  We weren't until then.
[02:33:14.923 --> 02:33:18.605]  Not a lot at each other's throats, but you know, both of us really pissed as men that this is happening.
[02:33:18.605 --> 02:33:24.288]  At the end of the day, we do as much as we can, but trust in God and take the stress off, because God gives us the way to do that.
[02:33:24.288 --> 02:33:25.569]  Does that make sense?
[02:33:25.569 --> 02:33:27.730]  Well, it's funny you say that, Alex, because, you know, there's all this stuff
[02:33:28.382 --> 02:33:32.004]  You know, the rumor mills about Infowars and it's just, we're just as real as it gets.
[02:33:32.004 --> 02:33:38.047]  I mean, we'll have tiffs, we'll go into office meetings and pound on desks to try to figure out how to defeat this stuff and be the most effective.
[02:33:38.047 --> 02:33:39.848]  But you know, the key there, Alex, is...
[02:33:40.981 --> 02:33:46.424]  You know, it really is all about love, and the more we can promote love and be an example of love, the better off we'll be.
[02:33:46.424 --> 02:33:51.426]  And part of the problem we have is we just stare into the abyss of evil all day long.
[02:33:51.426 --> 02:33:59.810]  It, like, sucks us in like a gravitational force, and so our energy starts to kind of fall off that cliff too, and that's why it's so important to get back out there.
[02:33:59.810 --> 02:34:05.052]  And the best way to do it, and you know this, is to just get into nature and just experience God's creation.
[02:34:05.052 --> 02:34:08.594]  See a sunset, see a river, you know, get on a creek, get on a lake,
[02:34:09.075 --> 02:34:10.781]  Tucker Carlson is absolutely right.
[02:34:10.781 --> 02:34:12.186]  Nature is medicine.
[02:34:12.186 --> 02:34:14.113]  God gave us that to soothe us.
[02:34:15.282 --> 02:34:35.534]  So, I think that the problem we have, Alex, is like you said, I mean, we're just so busy condemning evil, looking into the abyss of the evil, warning humanity it's coming, and the key is to just be able to find an outlet, whether it's floating on a river or, you know, hanging out with your family, going on a ski trip, whatever it is, and not becoming the abyss because you stare into it all day long.
[02:34:35.534 --> 02:34:37.075]  Exactly, that's what Jesus said.
[02:34:37.075 --> 02:34:40.196]  Jesus didn't say, look at Satan, he sucks, he's bad, he's a joke.
[02:34:40.196 --> 02:34:41.177]  He said, get behind me.
[02:34:41.750 --> 02:34:42.611]  We just move forward.
[02:34:42.611 --> 02:34:43.973]  We build the new world.
[02:34:43.973 --> 02:34:46.115]  We say, get out of our way, Satan.
[02:34:46.115 --> 02:34:46.956]  Like, yeah, they're scum.
[02:34:46.956 --> 02:34:47.457]  They're liars.
[02:34:47.457 --> 02:34:48.418]  We know they're fake.
[02:34:48.418 --> 02:34:50.701]  Let's talk about the better world we're building.
[02:34:50.701 --> 02:34:51.802]  Let's talk about the future.
[02:34:51.802 --> 02:34:52.283]  Does that make sense?
[02:34:53.732 --> 02:35:11.239]  And I think that if we could just, you know, that's the thing we know is if we could just get this New World Order off our back, if we could just get this tyranny off our back, we know the potential that humans have with the technology we have, the knowledge we have, the ability to communicate in nanoseconds with somebody across the face of the Earth.
[02:35:11.239 --> 02:35:14.900]  I mean, this is all empowering to humans, but it's being used against us.
[02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:21.832]  And it's being set up to create a prison planet, as you named the TV station years ago, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:35:21.832 --> 02:35:23.735]  That's what they're trying to build with the technology.
[02:35:23.735 --> 02:35:27.983]  So instead of empowering humanity with it, they're trying to oppress humanity with it.
[02:35:29.764 --> 02:35:30.685]  You're absolutely right.
[02:35:30.685 --> 02:35:34.528]  And that's the key to this, is fight it, expose it.
[02:35:34.528 --> 02:35:37.870]  But at the same time, don't just fight the barn the devil's burning down.
[02:35:37.870 --> 02:35:39.672]  Build another barn as well.
[02:35:39.672 --> 02:35:42.454]  You know, don't just talk about the evil that's going on.
[02:35:42.454 --> 02:35:46.317]  Do that, but also celebrate what's good so people have a choice.
[02:35:46.317 --> 02:35:47.017]  We'll be right back.
[02:35:47.017 --> 02:35:47.558]  Stay with us.

[02:36:47.432 --> 02:36:51.293]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[02:36:51.293 --> 02:36:55.614]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[02:36:55.614 --> 02:37:03.737]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:37:04.477 --> 02:37:21.082]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[02:37:21.082 --> 02:37:32.126]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[02:37:32.626 --> 02:37:41.094]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.

[02:37:52.545 --> 02:37:53.766]  Granny Do-Right.
[02:37:53.766 --> 02:37:54.586]  Granny Do-Right.
[02:37:54.586 --> 02:37:55.247]  Thanks for holding her
[02:37:58.324 --> 02:37:59.345]  I love your products.
[02:37:59.345 --> 02:38:10.053]  I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[02:38:10.053 --> 02:38:16.058]  But since taking Urex 2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[02:38:16.058 --> 02:38:17.079]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[02:38:19.340 --> 02:38:27.066]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[02:38:27.066 --> 02:38:35.831]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[02:38:35.831 --> 02:38:36.652]  This is working.
[02:38:36.652 --> 02:38:37.653]  This is wonderful.
[02:38:37.653 --> 02:38:42.176]  You know, I don't, I don't have to put on Dermablend anymore, you know?
[02:38:42.176 --> 02:38:46.819]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[02:38:50.865 --> 02:38:56.572]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us.
[02:38:56.572 --> 02:39:03.420]  Not just tracking and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well.
[02:39:03.420 --> 02:39:05.062]  With or without a battery.
[02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:11.947]  Now, with the Infowars Privacy Pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[02:39:11.947 --> 02:39:12.808]  Excellent.
[02:39:12.808 --> 02:39:18.414]  Now I have my own compact Faraday cage I can take wherever I want.
[02:39:18.414 --> 02:39:21.438]  And you can too, at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:39:22.999 --> 02:39:33.762]  Government agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now contact tracers are all tracking your every move through your mobile phone.
[02:39:33.762 --> 02:39:38.684]  Now you can have the power to easily cut them off and go dark.

[02:39:51.588 --> 02:40:06.721]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:40:06.721 --> 02:40:10.525]  I see a winter and I want it to be good.
[02:40:13.976 --> 02:40:14.676]  All right, folks.
[02:40:14.676 --> 02:40:16.937]  Alex Jones back live with Owen Schroer.
[02:40:16.937 --> 02:40:19.758]  The great Gerald Cilente is going to be coming up in the fourth hour.
[02:40:19.758 --> 02:40:25.920]  Owen will take a well-deserved hour break while he researches and eats a bite of lunch before he does the war of the day.
[02:40:25.920 --> 02:40:27.721]  3 to 6 p.m.
[02:40:27.721 --> 02:40:28.541]  Always excellent.
[02:40:28.541 --> 02:40:29.781]  Always jam-packed.
[02:40:29.781 --> 02:40:33.983]  And like I said, I'll be back if the flights aren't delayed sometime.
[02:40:33.983 --> 02:40:35.683]  I'll be flying out early in the morning from where I'm at.
[02:40:35.683 --> 02:40:36.783]  I'll leave it at that.
[02:40:36.783 --> 02:40:38.424]  And I should be back for most of the show tomorrow.
[02:40:38.424 --> 02:40:40.125]  But regardless, Owen will be there.
[02:40:40.125 --> 02:40:41.245]  But I wanted to raise this point.
[02:40:42.605 --> 02:40:58.832]  Because it's something I see a lot, and as patriots, as Christians, as nationalists, as populists, as conservatives, or just pro-humans, whatever you want to call us, just common sense people, I catch myself doing this, I catch our listeners doing it, I catch everybody doing it, and it's BS, it needs to stop.
[02:40:58.832 --> 02:41:06.615]  Oh, look, Governor Newsom's a hypocrite, he's having $1,000-a-plate dinners with a bunch of people not wearing a mask, he should wear his mask!
[02:41:06.615 --> 02:41:10.997]  Or, oh, they're giving, you know, liberals are getting the vaccine,
[02:41:11.778 --> 02:41:17.462]  Secretly, when they weren't 75 or older, remember that was the first group supposed to get it, they're stealing it for themselves.
[02:41:17.462 --> 02:41:18.302]  We play into it.
[02:41:18.302 --> 02:41:28.969]  It's this thing everyone wants, and it's this infusion, this essence that's so rare, like meeting a leprechaun that, you know, is basically riding a magic unicorn.
[02:41:30.695 --> 02:41:34.017]  And it's the same thing we see in this headline at Infowars.com.
[02:41:34.017 --> 02:41:38.039]  And I'm not bashing Kellan McBroom, who's a great writer, great brain, who wrote the article.
[02:41:38.039 --> 02:41:40.420]  I'm just saying, here is the angle.
[02:41:40.420 --> 02:41:46.724]  Illegals receiving COVID vaccines as citizens complain about lack of access.
[02:41:46.724 --> 02:41:50.606]  Well, at first they were letting all the illegals in, not even checking to see if they have COVID.
[02:41:50.606 --> 02:41:51.407]  What about bubonic plague?
[02:41:51.407 --> 02:41:51.907]  What about TB?
[02:41:54.002 --> 02:41:59.284]  And so it just becomes an idea of, oh look, we're being mean to the citizens.
[02:41:59.284 --> 02:42:02.146]  The illegals are getting this.
[02:42:02.146 --> 02:42:03.566]  We're all in this together.
[02:42:03.566 --> 02:42:08.789]  Do I want them to collapse the third world and flood us with tens of millions of people who have become political operatives and vote illegally?
[02:42:08.789 --> 02:42:10.450]  No.
[02:42:10.450 --> 02:42:17.513]  But Mexico announced ten years ago that it was the law that all little girls had to take Gardasil.
[02:42:17.513 --> 02:42:21.495]  Well, Gardasil attacks and sterilizes a large portion of the girls that take it.
[02:42:21.495 --> 02:42:22.195]  It attacks their ovaries.
[02:42:23.044 --> 02:42:28.251]  Now, do I want to be flooded by people from anywhere who are poor, who the Democrats control?
[02:42:28.251 --> 02:42:29.132]  No.
[02:42:29.132 --> 02:42:30.694]  But do I want to sterilize them?
[02:42:30.694 --> 02:42:32.997]  No.
[02:42:32.997 --> 02:42:34.299]  I want to empower them with liberty.
[02:42:35.942 --> 02:42:39.863]  This isn't, and it's a great article because it shows how there's prioritizing over citizens.
[02:42:39.863 --> 02:42:42.783]  Now they give free tuition to illegal aliens but not citizens.
[02:42:42.783 --> 02:42:46.924]  And it's a plan to bring people here so they can be exploited as a new underclass.
[02:42:46.924 --> 02:42:49.605]  Let's be clear, the enemy's not the poor people coming here.
[02:42:49.605 --> 02:42:52.666]  They're being exploited by the globalists, by big tech, by all of them.
[02:42:52.666 --> 02:42:53.986]  And we shouldn't allow it.
[02:42:53.986 --> 02:42:58.327]  We should show a real path of citizenship where people understand what they're doing.
[02:42:58.327 --> 02:43:01.987]  So they're not enrolled by the UN, prepared at refugee centers, and brought up here.
[02:43:01.987 --> 02:43:04.128]  But just to say then, oh,
[02:43:05.296 --> 02:43:07.557]  You know, I finally get access.
[02:43:07.557 --> 02:43:12.177]  Oh, they're already saying, hopefully soon, Fauci goes, your child will be able to get it.
[02:43:12.177 --> 02:43:13.398]  There might be enough.
[02:43:13.398 --> 02:43:14.838]  Well, children don't need it.
[02:43:14.838 --> 02:43:18.419]  Even if you believe the hoax, the COVID actually kills one-tenth of one percent.
[02:43:18.419 --> 02:43:19.679]  It doesn't kill any young people.
[02:43:19.679 --> 02:43:21.379]  So that's a fraud.
[02:43:21.379 --> 02:43:22.440]  And it's not a vaccine.
[02:43:22.440 --> 02:43:25.380]  It's an mRNA gene therapy linked to cancer.
[02:43:25.380 --> 02:43:26.701]  They don't want that out.
[02:43:26.701 --> 02:43:27.621]  So that's the issue.
[02:43:27.621 --> 02:43:31.802]  It should be, let's not let them experiment on the illegal aliens.
[02:43:31.802 --> 02:43:33.022]  Because I see the headlines everywhere.
[02:43:33.582 --> 02:43:35.943]  Black Americans aren't getting enough of it.
[02:43:35.943 --> 02:43:41.063]  They deserve a special clinic set up for the blacks at the sports stadium.
[02:43:41.063 --> 02:43:53.746]  And I can tell you, I was told this by a high-level doctor, it's come out in the news, and a whistleblower, they give the poor neighborhoods, I don't care if it's white Appalachians or whether it's blacks in Detroit, special vaccines.
[02:43:53.746 --> 02:43:56.526]  And the other people get the ones that aren't tainted.
[02:43:56.526 --> 02:43:59.487]  So when you hear there's a special inoculations for blacks or Hispanics,
[02:44:00.129 --> 02:44:05.612]  Let me assure you, Bill Gates and the UN saying they love brown people, ladies and gentlemen, they want to hurt you.
[02:44:05.612 --> 02:44:12.416]  And the good news is, blacks especially, but also Hispanics, don't trust the vaccine because they know about secret experimentation.
[02:44:12.416 --> 02:44:13.797]  Is the nurse injecting you bad?
[02:44:13.797 --> 02:44:15.458]  No, she means well.
[02:44:15.458 --> 02:44:24.724]  But the big pharma companies doing it, just like in Tanzania and then a bunch of other countries, they caught the vaccines coming in saying not for use in Europe.
[02:44:24.724 --> 02:44:28.006]  The Tanzanian president shot his mouth off one day later, was dead.
[02:44:29.341 --> 02:44:33.465]  He was the guy that exposed they were doing fake COVID stuff and they were lying.
[02:44:33.465 --> 02:44:38.209]  He was also the guy when he was a scientist working president that exposed they were putting HIV in the vaccines.
[02:44:38.209 --> 02:44:39.830]  That came out in mainstream news.
[02:44:39.830 --> 02:44:41.351]  Well, he's dead now.
[02:44:41.351 --> 02:44:46.095]  But I'm sure he's with our Lord and Savior because that's what God's looking for people to take one with the team.
[02:44:46.095 --> 02:44:47.156]  They clearly killed him.
[02:44:47.156 --> 02:44:48.777]  He was leading all of Africa out of this.
[02:44:48.777 --> 02:44:49.678]  They killed him.
[02:44:49.678 --> 02:44:51.860]  He disappeared for two weeks and was found dead.
[02:44:51.860 --> 02:44:53.902]  So yeah, that's called kidnapping.
[02:44:53.902 --> 02:44:56.384]  So there's been a coup there now in Tanzania.
[02:44:56.384 --> 02:44:57.165]  That's what's going down.
[02:44:58.504 --> 02:45:04.509]  You don't go, oh my gosh, the Mexicans are stealing our vaccines, or the Hondurans, or the Venezuelans.
[02:45:04.509 --> 02:45:06.070]  You go, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:45:06.070 --> 02:45:08.612]  They're taking disadvantaged people and hitting them first.
[02:45:08.612 --> 02:45:10.853]  And somebody needs to get those ampules.
[02:45:10.853 --> 02:45:12.495]  They need to get those bottles and test them.
[02:45:12.495 --> 02:45:14.536]  I bet you it's even worse.
[02:45:14.536 --> 02:45:15.517]  These globalists are sick.
[02:45:16.650 --> 02:45:22.051]  So a million of Americans complain they're having trouble getting their experimental COVID-19 vaccines.
[02:45:22.051 --> 02:45:24.792]  And notice, Kellen got that area a great job.
[02:45:24.792 --> 02:45:29.654]  Illegal aliens are guilt-tripping businesses into giving them shots first.
[02:45:29.654 --> 02:45:32.714]  And yes, they've been trained to how to be, I'm a victim.
[02:45:32.714 --> 02:45:38.896]  But see, now they're becoming the real victim by playing victim, because the globalists want you to be a victim so they control you, so they can really victimize you.
[02:45:40.120 --> 02:45:47.743]  Eligible Texans are struggling to find vaccination locations, while thousands of Mayo Clinic employees are wondering when they'll get their dose.
[02:45:47.743 --> 02:45:55.726]  Many grocery store employees around the country are complaining about the wait for the jabs, while people with serious chronic conditions are frustrated by the lack of access.
[02:45:55.726 --> 02:45:58.428]  This is how they create the frothing begging.
[02:45:58.428 --> 02:46:05.951]  It turned out with Cabbage Patch Dolls, Monchi Cheese, and they even made a movie about this with Schwarzenegger about the turbo doll.
[02:46:05.951 --> 02:46:08.672]  You get a new screw that you've paid in a major city,
[02:46:12.790 --> 02:46:13.210]  We're good to go.
[02:46:37.569 --> 02:46:40.630]  That's all they're doing with the shots, folks, is, I want it, I want it.
[02:46:40.630 --> 02:46:42.610]  Remember, oh, it's going to be two years until you get it.
[02:46:42.610 --> 02:46:43.911]  Oh, it's only six months.
[02:46:43.911 --> 02:46:45.511]  Oh, I got to have mine now.
[02:46:45.511 --> 02:46:49.152]  This is total and complete manipulation.
[02:46:49.152 --> 02:46:51.833]  Owen, what's your take on this?
[02:46:51.833 --> 02:47:03.596]  Well, what's amazing is that now the mainstream news, I covered a story out of Bloomberg, and I forget the other mainstream news article, but they're now admitting, Alex, it's not a vaccine.
[02:47:03.596 --> 02:47:06.057]  It's an experimental biotechnology.
[02:47:06.057 --> 02:47:06.797]  It's never been tested.
[02:47:07.598 --> 02:47:10.220]  We may not know the results for two years later.
[02:47:10.220 --> 02:47:13.142]  We're all taking part of this great human experiment, but it's a good thing.
[02:47:13.142 --> 02:47:13.903]  Yay!
[02:47:13.903 --> 02:47:18.166]  So they're even admitting it now that this is not a normal vaccine.
[02:47:18.166 --> 02:47:21.729]  This is an experimental biotechnology gene therapy.
[02:47:21.729 --> 02:47:32.257]  And so it's kind of like, oh, now that the side effects are going public, now that the deaths from the vaccine are going public, now they're kind of rolling it out like, oh yeah, well, we're just testing it, but we had to because of the pandemic.
[02:47:32.697 --> 02:47:42.414]  If you have a negative side effect, it's okay because you're helping humanity, which of course is the leftist ideology, which is kill yourself to save the planet.
[02:47:42.414 --> 02:47:43.356]  So that's what it's all about.
[02:47:44.520 --> 02:47:45.161]  Well, that's right.
[02:47:45.161 --> 02:47:45.922]  Wear the mask.
[02:47:45.922 --> 02:47:46.442]  You're dirty.
[02:47:46.442 --> 02:47:46.883]  You're bad.
[02:47:46.883 --> 02:47:47.964]  You're evil.
[02:47:47.964 --> 02:47:49.145]  And exactly.
[02:47:49.145 --> 02:47:53.490]  First, they admitted mRNA was illegal for decades because it caused so many deaths.
[02:47:53.490 --> 02:47:55.011]  Then they create a stampede.
[02:47:55.011 --> 02:47:57.173]  Say it isn't mRNA when it is.
[02:47:57.173 --> 02:47:58.135]  Then it causes death.
[02:47:58.135 --> 02:47:59.896]  Now they're like, OK, it is.
[02:47:59.896 --> 02:48:01.198]  So people get comfortable with it.
[02:48:01.198 --> 02:48:03.320]  This is all a psychological test.
[02:48:03.320 --> 02:48:04.041]  But the good news is
[02:48:05.516 --> 02:48:08.779]  25 countries in Western, Eastern Europe, Southern Europe have banned it.
[02:48:08.779 --> 02:48:09.600]  That was a few days ago.
[02:48:09.600 --> 02:48:10.781]  It's more every day.
[02:48:10.781 --> 02:48:15.825]  A whole bunch of countries worldwide, like India, have banned the mRNA vaccines, Moderna and Pfizer.
[02:48:15.825 --> 02:48:17.386]  And so it's coming out.
[02:48:17.386 --> 02:48:18.628]  The good news is it's coming out.
[02:48:18.628 --> 02:48:20.629]  But I'll tell you this, folks.
[02:48:20.629 --> 02:48:22.851]  The censorship is massive, and that's why.
[02:48:22.851 --> 02:48:25.854]  And I'm going to make some announcements here very, very soon.
[02:48:25.854 --> 02:48:29.117]  InfoWars has stayed on the air for 27 years.
[02:48:29.117 --> 02:48:30.097]  I've been on air 27 years.
[02:48:30.097 --> 02:48:30.918]  InfoWars has been around 25.
[02:48:30.918 --> 02:48:33.020]  And we've only done it because of you.
[02:48:33.797 --> 02:48:37.619]  But behind the scenes, the globalists, the enemies, are trying to shut us down.
[02:48:37.619 --> 02:48:41.380]  50-plus Democrat suits have gotten knocked down to six.
[02:48:41.380 --> 02:48:46.403]  But they use these to just absolutely deplatform us, go after our bank accounts, everything.
[02:48:46.403 --> 02:48:50.485]  That's why I've got plans to keep us on the air, and I'll tell you more about it soon.
[02:48:50.485 --> 02:48:51.085]  But believe me.
[02:48:51.713 --> 02:48:59.918]  Don't take for granted that InfoWars will just be here in a month or six months or a year if you don't spread the word, if you don't buy the products, and if you don't support us.
[02:48:59.918 --> 02:49:01.939]  You've seen everybody else getting shut down.
[02:49:01.939 --> 02:49:03.640]  There's only a few people barely hanging on.
[02:49:03.640 --> 02:49:04.521]  Rush Limbaugh's dead.
[02:49:04.521 --> 02:49:06.722]  They're trying to shut down Tucker Carlson.
[02:49:06.722 --> 02:49:09.844]  InfoWars is just as prominent as those great guys.
[02:49:09.844 --> 02:49:10.264]  Okay?
[02:49:10.264 --> 02:49:12.366]  And without you, we will not be on air.

[02:50:03.283 --> 02:50:06.304]  And now it's never been a more important time for InfoWars to be on the air.
[02:50:06.304 --> 02:50:08.525]  We're having such a great effect thanks to you.
[02:50:08.525 --> 02:50:10.125]  But we cannot do it without financial support.
[02:50:10.125 --> 02:50:10.706]  All right.
[02:50:10.706 --> 02:50:14.047]  Owen Schroer is going to take off for the next hour to get ready for the War Room.
[02:50:14.047 --> 02:50:18.468]  And 60 minutes from now, 62 minutes from now, it starts at InfoWars.com.
[02:50:18.468 --> 02:50:20.549]  And hopefully workstations pick it up.
[02:50:20.549 --> 02:50:21.849]  A lot of workstations are picking it up.
[02:50:21.849 --> 02:50:23.590]  That's coming up 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:50:23.590 --> 02:50:24.310]  Then, of course, there's
[02:50:24.870 --> 02:50:28.916]  National Journal with the great Harrison Smith, Wednesday mornings at 8 a.m.
[02:50:28.916 --> 02:50:30.077]  Also Tom Papert co-host.
[02:50:30.077 --> 02:50:31.059]  That's coming up.
[02:50:31.059 --> 02:50:32.220]  Thank you all for spreading the word.
[02:50:32.220 --> 02:50:35.886]  But first, we have the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilente.
[02:50:37.509 --> 02:50:41.691]  Alex Jones here with the new InfoWars sale and it is a fantastic sale.
[02:50:41.691 --> 02:50:45.752]  It is many of our best-selling products that just so happen to also be selling out.

[02:50:56.156 --> 02:50:56.757]  It's amazing.

[02:51:52.473 --> 02:51:54.015]  They want to keep you in the dark.
[02:51:54.015 --> 02:51:58.821]  I believe in humanity and I want to see you empowered because I know that John F. Kennedy was right.
[02:51:58.821 --> 02:52:00.423]  A raising tide raises all ships.
[02:52:01.784 --> 02:52:14.131]  Now, the supplements, the vitamins, the minerals, the compounds we have at InfoWarsTore.com are the very best sourced, well-crafted, organic, and natural product you're going to find anywhere.

[02:52:30.148 --> 02:52:41.079]  Take action today at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:52:41.079 --> 02:52:43.682]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:52:46.416 --> 02:52:53.816]  Events concerning the current version of the President of the United States make the chaos at the border actually seem secondary.
[02:53:08.510 --> 02:53:25.403]  Now that Biden's homage to Gerald Ford and Hillary Clinton is begging for deeper analysis, regardless that there was a blanketed media blackout by the leftist media over his fall up the stairs to Air Force One due to what they clumsily described as wind-related,
[02:53:25.623 --> 02:53:37.013]  There's cautious, and then there's the gold medal performance of the Air Force One Olympic event that 78-year-old brain surgery survivor Biden, the leader of the dwindling free world, pulled off.
[02:53:37.013 --> 02:53:42.917]  The White House will obviously fabricate anything to cover up the unrelenting Biden train wreck.
[02:53:42.917 --> 02:53:48.062]  Of course, what can you expect from an administration riddled with chronic potheads?
[02:53:49.263 --> 02:53:52.324]  I have a lot of respect for the Vice President.
[02:53:52.324 --> 02:53:55.004]  He has sworn me into my office as a hero.
[02:53:55.004 --> 02:53:59.425]  This week I hear him literally say that I don't think we should legalize marijuana.
[02:53:59.425 --> 02:54:06.066]  I thought you might have been high when you said it.
[02:54:06.066 --> 02:54:16.248]  And as the international community, led by Russia and China, throw more logs on the Biden fire, blindsiding Joe's amateur administration with fire and brimstone,
[02:54:17.612 --> 02:54:22.455]  I have to tell you, what I'm hearing is very different from what you described.
[02:54:22.455 --> 02:54:26.417]  Well, I think we thought too well of the United States.
[02:54:26.417 --> 02:54:27.437]  We thought that the U.S.
[02:54:27.437 --> 02:54:31.659]  side will follow the necessary diplomatic protocols.
[02:54:31.659 --> 02:54:34.821]  So for China, it was necessary that we make our position clear.
[02:54:48.649 --> 02:54:58.596]  So let me say here that in front of the Chinese side, the United States does not have the qualification to say that it wants to speak to China from a position of strength.
[02:54:58.596 --> 02:55:08.443]  I want to invite Biden to continue this discussion, but on condition that we do it live, online, without any delay, in an open, direct discussion.
[02:55:08.963 --> 02:55:10.545]  I think it would be interesting.
[02:55:10.545 --> 02:55:13.547]  While the border is thrown into chaos.
[02:55:13.547 --> 02:55:20.233]  Do you agree that Customs and Border Patrol encountered, or protection encountered more than 100,000 individuals in February?
[02:55:20.233 --> 02:55:21.374]  Which was a 173% increase from February 2020?
[02:55:21.374 --> 02:55:21.775]  Just yes or no?
[02:55:25.064 --> 02:55:29.787]  Um, uh, the numbers with respect to February of this year are accurate.
[02:55:29.787 --> 02:55:36.292]  Can you confirm that Customs and Border Protection's Donna facility was recently at over 700% capacity?
[02:55:36.292 --> 02:55:37.713]  I don't have the precise figure.
[02:55:37.713 --> 02:55:40.275]  It was certainly over capacity, Mr. Ranking Member.
[02:55:40.275 --> 02:55:40.535]  Thank you.
[02:55:40.535 --> 02:55:45.478]  You said earlier in your testimony that the situation at the border is undoubtedly difficult.
[02:55:45.478 --> 02:55:50.942]  But given the tremendous rise and surge of individuals coming to the border, wouldn't it be fair to call it a crisis?
[02:55:50.942 --> 02:55:52.323]  Because that's what your agents are calling it.
[02:55:52.956 --> 02:55:57.017]  Mr. Ranking Member, I'm not spending any time on the language that we use.
[02:55:57.017 --> 02:55:59.358]  So we've known this is a crisis.
[02:55:59.358 --> 02:56:06.101]  What I learned in just the past hour shows that we are now dealing with a humanitarian disaster.
[02:56:06.101 --> 02:56:09.882]  What we learned in Midland just in the past hour is two things.
[02:56:10.562 --> 02:56:16.446]  One is they have no proven clean running water at the location.
[02:56:16.446 --> 02:56:23.650]  They were using well water that the Texas Commission on Environmental Equality has informed the federal government has not been proven to be safe.
[02:56:23.650 --> 02:56:27.812]  There's no telling what could be in there including the possibility of arsenic.
[02:56:28.292 --> 02:56:37.175]  And then on top of that, more than 10% of the migrants at the Midland location have now tested positive for COVID-19.
[02:56:37.175 --> 02:56:41.456]  The Biden administration, the president himself, promised to be incredibly transparent.
[02:56:41.456 --> 02:56:44.777]  So when can journalists enter these facilities?
[02:56:44.777 --> 02:56:45.397]  Why not tomorrow?
[02:56:45.954 --> 02:56:50.199]  We are focused on our operations and the needs of the children.
[02:56:50.199 --> 02:56:57.848]  And at the same time, we are working to provide access to those border patrol facilities when we can do so.
[02:56:57.848 --> 02:57:06.578]  As known, terrorists are detained by an immigration department that can barely enforce anything under Biden's free-for-all cloward and pivot onslaught.
[02:57:06.678 --> 02:57:11.861]  People even on the terror watch list, people from Yemen and the Middle East are coming across the border now.
[02:57:11.861 --> 02:57:17.065]  So we are really, we have a time problem here.
[02:57:17.065 --> 02:57:22.568]  Leaving Americans to scratch their heads and wonder, did any terrorists actually make it through?
[02:57:22.568 --> 02:57:28.652]  This has to be the most miserable administration I've ever witnessed in my lifetime as an American citizen.
[02:57:28.652 --> 02:57:36.137]  And if you want a quick look at popular opinion, look no further than the like-dislike ratio on the White House YouTube channel.
[02:57:36.277 --> 02:57:39.038]  Mr. Biden, America is furious.
[02:57:39.038 --> 02:57:46.962]  John Bowne reporting.
[02:57:46.962 --> 02:57:48.143]  I knew Trump was embattled.
[02:57:48.143 --> 02:57:56.567]  I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double-talking agents of the enemy.
[02:57:56.567 --> 02:57:58.588]  And a lot of people just couldn't believe it.
[02:57:58.588 --> 02:58:01.609]  They're like, oh no, it's 3G chess, 5G chess, he's invincible.
[02:58:04.991 --> 02:58:06.453]  We're good to go.
[02:58:20.444 --> 02:58:21.685]  We pay the most of anybody in the world.
[02:58:21.685 --> 02:58:25.268]  That's just one case of hundreds of things that Trump had reversed.
[02:58:25.268 --> 02:58:28.451]  And now people are going to feel the sting and the pain.
[02:58:28.451 --> 02:58:29.612]  The energy cost, everything else.
[02:58:29.612 --> 02:58:40.841]  But what's really illustrated this is the trial in the Senate where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity.
[02:58:40.841 --> 02:58:42.723]  Because the fix is in, folks.
[02:58:42.723 --> 02:58:44.244]  The swamp is deep.
[02:58:44.244 --> 02:58:46.026]  Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[02:58:59.291 --> 02:59:01.213]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:59:01.213 --> 02:59:10.079]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilente.
[02:59:10.079 --> 02:59:14.242]  Hey, hello, hello, hello.
[02:59:14.242 --> 02:59:15.984]  Great being on The Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:15.984 --> 02:59:19.166]  It's a real treat being here.
[02:59:19.166 --> 02:59:28.153]  It's like he's saying to everybody, do what you can to support InfoWars, because censorship is the real thing.
[02:59:29.468 --> 02:59:37.151]  They're taking everybody off everywhere that will not say what they want to say.
[02:59:37.151 --> 02:59:38.952]  You have to obey.
[02:59:38.952 --> 02:59:40.593]  We've lost our freedom.
[02:59:40.593 --> 02:59:42.894]  It's gone in front of our eyes.
[02:59:42.894 --> 02:59:49.936]  And that news report that I just watched on InfoWars is really first rate.
[02:59:49.936 --> 02:59:54.938]  One of the things I'd like to talk today about is the Biden bounce.
[02:59:54.938 --> 02:59:55.659]  Yep.
[02:59:55.659 --> 02:59:58.300]  Now, I don't mean a bouncing down the stairs.
[02:59:59.249 --> 03:00:08.877]  What a, what a, you know, as you guys point out, you know, the major media doesn't pick that up at all.
[03:00:08.877 --> 03:00:10.578]  Blackballed.
[03:00:10.578 --> 03:00:11.719]  Yep.
[03:00:11.719 --> 03:00:12.960]  Look at the clown show.
[03:00:12.960 --> 03:00:15.942]  Look at the clown show we got in front of us.
[03:00:15.942 --> 03:00:19.245]  There's going to be a Biden bounce.
[03:00:19.245 --> 03:00:20.086]  What are they putting in?
[03:00:20.086 --> 03:00:24.389]  I mean, look at this, look at this, look at this.
[03:00:24.389 --> 03:00:27.772]  I mean, you know, that's our president.
[03:00:28.482 --> 03:00:42.210]  The guy's been a nobody his whole life, he's been sucking off the public tit since he's 30 years old, like all these politicians, poli-tics, many tics, and bureau-craps, you got it?
[03:00:42.210 --> 03:00:47.373]  Not bureaucrats, bureau-crap heads!
[03:00:47.373 --> 03:00:51.335]  That's all they are, these are little low-life slum
[03:00:52.375 --> 03:01:00.541]  That can't get a job in the real world, that get into the politics system, so they can become a health minister!
[03:01:00.541 --> 03:01:06.385]  Look at that guy they got up there in Nova Scotia, Strang.
[03:01:06.385 --> 03:01:08.366]  How about Strange?
[03:01:08.366 --> 03:01:11.809]  Yeah, this guy's neck goes into his chin.
[03:01:11.809 --> 03:01:14.951]  You know, it's like one big, you know, you're telling me about health?
[03:01:15.822 --> 03:01:20.224]  And of course we got Lola, L-O-L-A, Lola.
[03:01:20.224 --> 03:01:25.887]  Yeah, the guy, woman, that's our health minister, Rachel Levine.
[03:01:25.887 --> 03:01:28.629]  I haven't heard from her and him anymore.
[03:01:28.629 --> 03:01:30.710]  Look at the freaks we got running the show.
[03:01:30.710 --> 03:01:37.454]  So going back to where the markets are going, where the Biden bounce is going, there he is, Lola.
[03:01:37.454 --> 03:01:39.755]  Yeah.
[03:01:39.755 --> 03:01:45.178]  Imagine this clown, clown telling me about health.
[03:01:45.178 --> 03:01:45.238]  Oh.
[03:01:46.135 --> 03:01:47.396]  Natural Healing.
[03:01:47.396 --> 03:01:49.096]  First book I worked on.
[03:01:49.096 --> 03:01:51.077]  Won a book.
[03:01:51.077 --> 03:01:51.518]  1984.
[03:01:51.518 --> 03:01:52.198]  Rachel.
[03:01:52.198 --> 03:01:56.940]  Honorary Doctorate from the National University of Health Sciences.
[03:01:56.940 --> 03:01:59.201]  Rachel.
[03:01:59.201 --> 03:02:01.022]  Don't tell me about health.
[03:02:01.022 --> 03:02:03.163]  With more chins than Chinatown.
[03:02:03.163 --> 03:02:04.263]  Anyway.
[03:02:04.263 --> 03:02:05.264]  Going back.
[03:02:05.264 --> 03:02:08.485]  This is the BS they shoved down your throat.
[03:02:08.485 --> 03:02:13.768]  They're giving us 1.9 trillion dollar stimulus package.
[03:02:16.522 --> 03:02:17.943]  That's like saying $99.99.
[03:02:17.943 --> 03:02:24.525]  How about $2 trillion?
[03:02:24.525 --> 03:02:30.247]  $2 trillion being pumped into the system, artificially inflating it.
[03:02:30.247 --> 03:02:34.668]  And what they're artificially inflating are the equity markets.
[03:02:34.668 --> 03:02:38.109]  The equity markets are going to crash.
[03:02:38.109 --> 03:02:43.531]  It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.
[03:02:43.531 --> 03:02:45.772]  And the when is they run out of
[03:02:46.525 --> 03:03:04.719]  Just like they've given us these vaccinations to keep us safe, they're giving us monetary methadone injections that are artificially propping up the equity markets.
[03:03:04.719 --> 03:03:06.180]  That's it.
[03:03:06.180 --> 03:03:07.962]  It's fake money.
[03:03:07.962 --> 03:03:11.465]  It doesn't exist.
[03:03:11.465 --> 03:03:14.487]  And they have to keep interest rates low.
[03:03:15.640 --> 03:03:22.085]  Because they got now this way, they got 28 trillion dollars worth of debt.
[03:03:22.085 --> 03:03:24.867]  So the higher your interest rates goes, the higher your debt level goes.
[03:03:24.867 --> 03:03:29.591]  So they're going to do everything they can to keep interest rates low.
[03:03:29.591 --> 03:03:31.472]  So what does all that mean?
[03:03:31.472 --> 03:03:34.475]  Inflation.
[03:03:34.475 --> 03:03:38.438]  Go out and try to buy any lumber lately?
[03:03:38.438 --> 03:03:45.263]  The cost of building a house on average now, according to the National Association of Home Builders,
[03:03:46.081 --> 03:03:51.522]  Has increased some $24,000 on average.
[03:03:51.522 --> 03:03:54.843]  Because the increase is just in lumber.
[03:03:54.843 --> 03:03:58.144]  You been to the store to buy anything lately?
[03:03:58.144 --> 03:04:01.885]  This is dragflation.
[03:04:01.885 --> 03:04:05.286]  The economy is going to go down and inflation is going to go up.
[03:04:05.286 --> 03:04:08.987]  And they're going to have to keep interest rates low.
[03:04:08.987 --> 03:04:10.847]  To keep the Ponzi scheme going.
[03:04:11.664 --> 03:04:15.206]  And I find it offensive that they call it a Ponzi scheme.
[03:04:15.206 --> 03:04:17.328]  That's an Italian name.
[03:04:17.328 --> 03:04:18.569]  Yeah.
[03:04:18.569 --> 03:04:19.950]  What if we called it another name?
[03:04:19.950 --> 03:04:22.171]  Oh, I'd be an anti-Semite.
[03:04:22.171 --> 03:04:22.872]  Take it easy.
[03:04:22.872 --> 03:04:23.952]  Take it easy.
[03:04:23.952 --> 03:04:26.394]  Good and bad comes in everything.
[03:04:26.394 --> 03:04:28.696]  When we talk about bad Italians, look at the Italians.
[03:04:28.696 --> 03:04:29.997]  I'm ashamed of them.
[03:04:29.997 --> 03:04:32.338]  They brought Dracula in there to run their country.
[03:04:32.338 --> 03:04:33.419]  Oh, Draghi.
[03:04:33.419 --> 03:04:34.540]  Mario Draghi.
[03:04:34.540 --> 03:04:35.160]  Dracula.
[03:04:37.071 --> 03:04:58.629]  Head of the Goldman Sachs gang, European division, former bank president of the European Central Bank, former guy who worked for the World Bank, guy who was the governor of the Bank of Italy, and the low-lives, Five Star Movement, and Northern League brought him in to run it.
[03:04:58.629 --> 03:04:59.230]  You got it?
[03:04:59.230 --> 03:05:02.252]  I'm mentioning this because that's who's in charge.
[03:05:02.252 --> 03:05:04.494]  A criminal group is in charge.
[03:05:04.494 --> 03:05:05.215]  Banksters.
[03:05:07.125 --> 03:05:09.146]  Remember the guy, Jesus Christ?
[03:05:09.146 --> 03:05:13.770]  Yeah, we won't be able to celebrate Easter this year, but anyway, it's coming up.
[03:05:13.770 --> 03:05:22.796]  Because the scum over there, Draghi, just locked down Italy, most of it, and you can't get together during Easter time.
[03:05:22.796 --> 03:05:24.317]  That's right.
[03:05:24.317 --> 03:05:26.839]  Oh yeah, Easter time.
[03:05:26.839 --> 03:05:27.959]  Boop!
[03:05:27.959 --> 03:05:34.464]  After he drives the money changers out of the temple, cat's up on the cross over there, three days later.
[03:05:34.464 --> 03:05:36.025]  That's who's running the show.
[03:05:36.954 --> 03:05:40.995]  It's right in front of everybody's eyes.
[03:05:40.995 --> 03:05:47.318]  They're going to do everything they can to keep gold prices down and silver prices.
[03:05:47.318 --> 03:05:51.219]  Bitcoin, it's anybody's guess.
[03:05:51.219 --> 03:05:55.681]  Our breakout point for Bitcoin, as we're speaking now, it's in, you know, the $56,000, $58,000 range.
[03:05:55.681 --> 03:05:57.741]  When it goes below $26,000, it's going to tank.
[03:06:03.510 --> 03:06:04.891]  Is our forecast.
[03:06:04.891 --> 03:06:05.892]  But it may go to 300,000.
[03:06:05.892 --> 03:06:10.416]  I don't know.
[03:06:10.416 --> 03:06:16.421]  It's going to come down when the government's regulated.
[03:06:16.421 --> 03:06:21.024]  And they're going to regulate it as they go digital.
[03:06:21.024 --> 03:06:24.507]  And China's going digital.
[03:06:24.507 --> 03:06:26.689]  They're pushing this thing through big time.
[03:06:27.617 --> 03:06:37.199]  Those low-life scum politicians want everything to be digital money so they know where you spent it, how you spent it, who you spent it on.
[03:06:37.199 --> 03:06:39.979]  You can't even give a tip.
[03:06:39.979 --> 03:06:41.039]  Nothing.
[03:06:41.039 --> 03:06:42.960]  Nothing.
[03:06:42.960 --> 03:06:44.360]  They'll know everything.
[03:06:44.360 --> 03:06:45.980]  And you know why they're doing it?
[03:06:45.980 --> 03:06:53.401]  Because these low-life pieces of garbage, they don't work a day in their life.
[03:06:53.401 --> 03:06:56.242]  So they need your tax money so they don't have to work.
[03:06:57.682 --> 03:07:00.603]  Look at the clown show!
[03:07:00.603 --> 03:07:03.384]  Look at them!
[03:07:03.384 --> 03:07:04.685]  Look what you got in Texas.
[03:07:04.685 --> 03:07:07.106]  How about Costello?
[03:07:07.106 --> 03:07:08.246]  What do you got over there?
[03:07:08.246 --> 03:07:10.867]  Gruesome Newsome in California.
[03:07:10.867 --> 03:07:17.770]  Witless Whitmer in Michigan.
[03:07:17.770 --> 03:07:19.330]  Cuomo.
[03:07:19.330 --> 03:07:21.011]  Yep.
[03:07:21.011 --> 03:07:22.531]  Cuomo.
[03:07:22.531 --> 03:07:25.672]  Fill him up Cuomo.
[03:07:25.672 --> 03:07:26.933]  Over here in New York.
[03:07:28.055 --> 03:07:29.836]  Daddy's boy.
[03:07:29.836 --> 03:07:32.678]  Look at the jerk he got up there in Canada.
[03:07:32.678 --> 03:07:33.739]  True doe.
[03:07:33.739 --> 03:07:36.501]  Nothing true about the little doe boy.
[03:07:36.501 --> 03:07:44.606]  Another daddy's boy or maybe a daddy's girl because that's the kind of cojones that little clown has.
[03:07:44.606 --> 03:07:49.590]  Would be nobody if daddy wasn't there before him.
[03:07:49.590 --> 03:07:52.572]  That's who's running the show.
[03:07:52.572 --> 03:07:54.453]  The markets are going to crash.
[03:07:56.894 --> 03:08:06.581]  We are bullish on gold and silver, despite what's going on now.
[03:08:06.581 --> 03:08:08.662]  When will the markets crash?
[03:08:08.662 --> 03:08:11.905]  We're doing our best to tell you.
[03:08:11.905 --> 03:08:16.748]  Gregory Manorino, who you well know, writes in our Trends Journal.
[03:08:16.748 --> 03:08:20.071]  He'll be putting out an article this week, more about it.
[03:08:20.071 --> 03:08:22.532]  Magazine's coming out tomorrow.
[03:08:22.532 --> 03:08:25.935]  It's over 130-something pages each week, no advertisements.
[03:08:27.182 --> 03:08:32.369]  Again, support InfoWars.
[03:08:32.369 --> 03:08:34.392]  Support the truth.
[03:08:34.392 --> 03:08:36.515]  We're going to be back in a little bit.
[03:08:36.515 --> 03:08:39.799]  And do what you can to put your money where your heart is.
[03:08:39.799 --> 03:08:40.781]  Keep freedom alive.
[03:08:44.665 --> 03:08:46.187]  The people are awakening.
[03:08:46.187 --> 03:08:48.911]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[03:08:48.911 --> 03:08:50.993]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[03:08:50.993 --> 03:08:53.336]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[03:08:53.336 --> 03:08:59.925]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai Coms especially, are using this.
[03:09:00.265 --> 03:09:11.596]  To steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data, they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[03:09:11.596 --> 03:09:18.283]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[03:09:18.283 --> 03:09:19.704]  In their own words, they admit it.
[03:09:19.704 --> 03:09:24.149]  So, I've been selling privacy pouches and locket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[03:09:24.609 --> 03:09:26.550]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[03:09:26.550 --> 03:09:27.630]  They're Faraday cages.
[03:09:27.630 --> 03:09:29.290]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[03:09:29.290 --> 03:09:31.331]  They work absolutely great.
[03:09:31.331 --> 03:09:40.473]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother to know what you're up to because it's none of their business.

[03:11:16.190 --> 03:11:17.010]  Hello, hello!
[03:11:17.010 --> 03:11:19.852]  Great to be on The Alex Jones Show!

[03:11:27.758 --> 03:11:31.160]  They're keeping the truth alive, and censorship is big.
[03:11:31.160 --> 03:11:33.422]  And it's only going to get worse.
[03:11:33.422 --> 03:11:34.783]  So put your money where your heart is.
[03:11:36.624 --> 03:11:38.265]  So here we go.
[03:11:38.265 --> 03:11:46.947]  I'll be talking about low-life pieces of slimy, scum, garbage crap called politicians.
[03:11:46.947 --> 03:11:51.989]  There's one over here not too far from where I am over there in Jersey.
[03:11:51.989 --> 03:11:53.269]  Yeah.
[03:11:53.269 --> 03:11:58.271]  Little Boy Murphy, another clown of a jerk.
[03:11:58.271 --> 03:12:02.052]  Another piece of low-life garbage.
[03:12:04.784 --> 03:12:06.846]  Locking down the state again.
[03:12:06.846 --> 03:12:07.827]  That's right.
[03:12:07.827 --> 03:12:09.309]  Think things were bad before?
[03:12:09.309 --> 03:12:19.679]  New Jersey will likely pause its reopening plans as COVID-19 cases... Look at that jerk!
[03:12:19.679 --> 03:12:22.221]  Look at that jerk, all right?
[03:12:22.221 --> 03:12:23.983]  Look at him!
[03:12:23.983 --> 03:12:25.405]  That's not a man!
[03:12:26.559 --> 03:12:28.661]  That's a moron!
[03:12:28.661 --> 03:12:34.946]  It's an egotistical little piece of crap scum, like the rest of them!
[03:12:34.946 --> 03:12:36.748]  Polly Ticks!
[03:12:36.748 --> 03:12:38.429]  Polly Ticks!
[03:12:38.429 --> 03:12:40.070]  Many Ticks!
[03:12:40.070 --> 03:12:43.553]  Sucking the life out of us!
[03:12:43.553 --> 03:12:45.615]  Cases regard- Cases!
[03:12:45.615 --> 03:12:47.777]  Okay, Murderous Murphy!
[03:12:47.777 --> 03:12:51.860]  You like the Slimer over here, Cuomo!
[03:12:51.860 --> 03:12:54.843]  Look at the great job you did with Nursing Homes, huh?
[03:12:55.857 --> 03:12:58.879]  Oh, you too lie about your numbers over there.
[03:12:58.879 --> 03:13:16.929]  Over 50% of the people that died, according to some of the data, at the lowest end, 35% of the people that died in Jersey were from nursing homes that died of COVID.
[03:13:16.929 --> 03:13:24.694]  So the little clown boys and girls locked down everywhere as the elderly
[03:13:25.686 --> 03:13:39.032]  from nursing homes are dying, and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, 94% of the people that have died from it had 2.6 pre-existing comorbidities.
[03:13:39.032 --> 03:13:43.754]  Among them, obesity.
[03:13:43.754 --> 03:13:44.854]  Yeah.
[03:13:44.854 --> 03:13:47.716]  Like Lola.
[03:13:47.716 --> 03:13:50.097]  L-O-L-A Lola.
[03:13:50.097 --> 03:13:50.937]  Yep.
[03:13:50.937 --> 03:13:52.618]  Our fat.
[03:13:52.618 --> 03:13:52.878]  Our fat.
[03:13:57.955 --> 03:14:00.216]  Secretary of Health in the United States.
[03:14:00.216 --> 03:14:04.717]  Hey, how come you're not parading them around anymore, huh?
[03:14:04.717 --> 03:14:07.938]  These are the people telling you what to do.
[03:14:07.938 --> 03:14:10.518]  They are destroying the lives and livelihoods.
[03:14:10.518 --> 03:14:10.979]  Look at this.
[03:14:10.979 --> 03:14:11.979]  Look at this.
[03:14:11.979 --> 03:14:12.959]  Look at this.
[03:14:12.959 --> 03:14:19.941]  How can anybody with a brain bigger than a pea take health advice from Lola?
[03:14:19.941 --> 03:14:23.242]  L-O-L-A, Lola.
[03:14:23.242 --> 03:14:25.843]  And look at that guy, the other one up in Canada.
[03:14:25.843 --> 03:14:26.703]  That guy, Strang.
[03:14:29.562 --> 03:14:48.211]  Yeah, this is him shooting his mouth off last week, bragging that they had positive results from the lockdowns as they fined four people $1,000 fine for weekend gatherings.
[03:14:48.211 --> 03:14:51.493]  And you look at the numbers who have died in Canada.
[03:14:51.493 --> 03:14:51.873]  You ready?
[03:14:57.182 --> 03:15:09.152]  Depending on whose numbers, Lancet and others, some 80% of the people that have died in Canada from the COVID are from nursing homes.
[03:15:09.152 --> 03:15:15.717]  But, look, yeah, then you got the Ontario Prime Minister over there, Doug Ford.
[03:15:15.717 --> 03:15:17.879]  Yeah, Fat Ford.
[03:15:17.879 --> 03:15:20.381]  Another clown boy telling you what to do.
[03:15:20.381 --> 03:15:22.963]  Look at the shape of these people.
[03:15:22.963 --> 03:15:23.664]  Health advice?
[03:15:25.794 --> 03:15:28.677]  Get this in your head, everybody.
[03:15:28.677 --> 03:15:39.846]  Politicians are nothing more than the people you hated in high school and college that wanted to be class president and head of the student council.
[03:15:39.846 --> 03:15:43.069]  So now they're locking down again in Jersey.
[03:15:43.069 --> 03:15:47.713]  And you're going to see more lockdowns happening.
[03:15:47.713 --> 03:15:50.435]  This economy is going down big time.
[03:15:53.186 --> 03:15:55.686]  A trillion dollars, you got that?
[03:15:55.686 --> 03:16:04.888]  One trillion dollars has been lost in the tourism business this year.
[03:16:04.888 --> 03:16:15.490]  Final tally, travel loss 1.1 trillion in US economic output in 2020.
[03:16:15.490 --> 03:16:16.590]  And who's this according to?
[03:16:16.590 --> 03:16:19.911]  The US Travel Association.
[03:16:22.598 --> 03:16:26.221]  And the research firm Tourism Economics.
[03:16:26.221 --> 03:16:29.663]  Excuse me.
[03:16:29.663 --> 03:16:36.487]  Travel supported jobs fell by 5.6 million in 2020.
[03:16:36.487 --> 03:16:37.848]  All right.
[03:16:37.848 --> 03:16:39.429]  Look who's doing this.
[03:16:39.429 --> 03:16:44.153]  Oh, and how about this for another low life little boy?
[03:16:44.153 --> 03:16:47.775]  Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing of a little boy.
[03:16:47.775 --> 03:16:50.357]  The guy over there running Qantas
[03:16:51.212 --> 03:16:54.014]  Airways over there in Australia.
[03:16:54.014 --> 03:16:57.016]  What a freak show Australia is.
[03:16:57.016 --> 03:16:58.898]  They locked that down, that joint.
[03:16:58.898 --> 03:17:02.821]  I think you have under a thousand people dying in a year.
[03:17:02.821 --> 03:17:06.063]  Where they got about 25 million people.
[03:17:06.063 --> 03:17:10.526]  This guy Joyce, Alan Joyce.
[03:17:10.526 --> 03:17:17.331]  He wants everybody that gets on an airplane to get vaccinated.
[03:17:17.331 --> 03:17:19.313]  This is a gutless little clown.
[03:17:20.515 --> 03:17:32.722]  Back in 2017, he's giving a talk, and a guy walks up behind him and puts a pie in his face.
[03:17:32.722 --> 03:17:35.784]  And rubs it in his face.
[03:17:35.784 --> 03:17:38.465]  And you know what the little Joycey boy did?
[03:17:38.465 --> 03:17:43.448]  The little nothing clown that tells us to get vaccinated?
[03:17:43.448 --> 03:17:46.450]  He stood there like a gutless little nothing.
[03:17:48.766 --> 03:18:03.873]  If somebody put a pie in my face, the guy would be on the ground with that pie up his you-know-what.
[03:18:03.873 --> 03:18:07.674]  Look at this little boy of nothing!
[03:18:07.674 --> 03:18:10.015]  Of nothing!
[03:18:10.015 --> 03:18:11.936]  Nothing!
[03:18:11.936 --> 03:18:13.537]  That's who's telling us what to do.
[03:18:14.392 --> 03:18:16.153]  You can't get better than that.
[03:18:16.153 --> 03:18:17.714]  Look at the little guy.
[03:18:17.714 --> 03:18:18.175]  Look at him.
[03:18:18.175 --> 03:18:19.375]  Looks at him.
[03:18:19.375 --> 03:18:24.939]  That guy walking back, he'd never be walking again.
[03:18:24.939 --> 03:18:26.760]  Oh, Solenti, you're violent.
[03:18:26.760 --> 03:18:28.622]  You should be like the rest of us.
[03:18:28.622 --> 03:18:33.885]  Oh, yeah, you see little Boris Johnson getting a shot up his know-what?
[03:18:33.885 --> 03:18:37.248]  With his eyes like that?
[03:18:37.248 --> 03:18:38.408]  Oh, isn't it great?
[03:18:38.408 --> 03:18:43.332]  Get your Krispy Kreme doughnuts for nothing when you show your vaccination pass.
[03:18:45.566 --> 03:18:48.068]  That's what's going on.
[03:18:48.068 --> 03:18:55.032]  If you don't stand up and fight for freedom, we are living hell on earth right now and it's going to get worse.
[03:18:55.032 --> 03:18:58.354]  You're not going to be able to celebrate Christmas, remember?
[03:18:58.354 --> 03:19:01.075]  And no Easter time this year either.
[03:19:01.075 --> 03:19:04.978]  No Easter!
[03:19:04.978 --> 03:19:05.798]  Isn't that great?
[03:19:05.798 --> 03:19:10.201]  Walmart, the vaccine passport.
[03:19:10.201 --> 03:19:11.942]  Vaccine passport.
[03:19:11.942 --> 03:19:13.423]  How about a passport to hell?
[03:19:14.952 --> 03:19:18.913]  This thing hasn't been tested!
[03:19:18.913 --> 03:19:20.854]  Operation Warp Speed!
[03:19:20.854 --> 03:19:25.575]  And you gotta have a warped brain to believe a Walmart!
[03:19:25.575 --> 03:19:32.177]  But maybe not a Krispy Kreme because there's really high quality crap!
[03:19:32.177 --> 03:19:33.158]  We're gonna take a break.
[03:19:33.158 --> 03:19:34.738]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:34.738 --> 03:19:37.719]  Go to InfoWars stores.
[03:19:37.719 --> 03:19:39.760]  Protect yourself.
[03:19:39.760 --> 03:19:40.460]  You will need it.
[03:19:43.900 --> 03:19:57.751]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic, because I sit there and I beg you for support, constantly, for prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth, and we're all in this together.
[03:19:57.751 --> 03:20:03.095]  And it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[03:20:03.095 --> 03:20:03.796]  But it's true.
[03:20:03.796 --> 03:20:07.199]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level.
[03:20:07.939 --> 03:20:08.620]  We're good to go.
[03:20:25.599 --> 03:20:27.621]  And America's still quasi-free.
[03:20:27.621 --> 03:20:32.767]  If you can't have InfoWars, it's been proven right being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[03:20:32.767 --> 03:20:34.909]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[03:20:34.909 --> 03:20:37.571]  So thank you all, and get into InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:20:37.571 --> 03:20:41.075]  Get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements, and so much more.
[03:20:41.075 --> 03:20:42.857]  They're wonderful products, and they support the InfoWars.
[03:20:42.857 --> 03:20:43.077]  Thank you.
[03:20:44.813 --> 03:20:53.040]  As negative as times are right now, and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand that this is all a test.
[03:20:53.040 --> 03:20:59.066]  This experience, this life on this planet, is a reckoning.
[03:20:59.066 --> 03:21:07.953]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension, so we can decide where we want to spend eternity, and what level we want to go to.
[03:21:07.953 --> 03:21:09.195]  And it really does come down to that.
[03:21:10.396 --> 03:21:17.803]  As sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[03:21:17.803 --> 03:21:21.426]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[03:21:21.426 --> 03:21:23.668]  God is the author of us having free will.
[03:21:24.346 --> 03:21:24.566]  I think?
[03:21:40.922 --> 03:21:41.282]  We're good.
[03:21:57.321 --> 03:22:06.105]  A lot of people love Deep Earth Pure Crystal Iodine, but you should put one out with Deep Earth Crystal Iodine and the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[03:22:06.105 --> 03:22:06.365]  Boom!
[03:22:06.365 --> 03:22:06.746]  We did it.
[03:22:06.746 --> 03:22:07.246]  It's popular.
[03:22:07.246 --> 03:22:08.026]  It's X3.
[03:22:08.026 --> 03:22:09.247]  Is it better than X2?
[03:22:09.247 --> 03:22:09.927]  You decide.
[03:22:09.927 --> 03:22:11.388]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[03:22:11.388 --> 03:22:15.450]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular Powdered Pill
[03:22:16.410 --> 03:22:18.573]  SleepAid, and that is down and out.
[03:22:18.573 --> 03:22:23.277]  It's super strong, way stronger than Knockout, but they don't compete with each other.
[03:22:23.277 --> 03:22:30.465]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas, and it's 40% off, out of the gates, at InfoWareStore.com and free shipping.
[03:22:30.465 --> 03:22:34.869]  Secure your down and out today, and while you're sleeping, you know you're funding the InfoWare at the same time.
[03:22:34.869 --> 03:22:38.853]  Down and out, exclusively available at InfoWareStore.com for 40% off and free shipping.
[03:22:44.201 --> 03:22:46.583]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[03:22:46.583 --> 03:22:48.324]  It's very bittersweet.
[03:22:48.324 --> 03:22:51.326]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[03:22:51.326 --> 03:22:52.566]  And now we have a lot of credibility.
[03:22:52.566 --> 03:22:53.507]  But I don't care about that.
[03:22:53.507 --> 03:22:55.528]  I care about beating the New World Order.
[03:22:55.528 --> 03:23:00.251]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[03:23:00.251 --> 03:23:03.594]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[03:23:03.594 --> 03:23:05.115]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[03:23:05.115 --> 03:23:06.315]  But let's just say this.
[03:23:06.315 --> 03:23:07.636]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[03:23:07.636 --> 03:23:10.098]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[03:23:10.718 --> 03:23:14.359]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at mfulworthstore.com.
[03:23:14.359 --> 03:23:16.920]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[03:23:16.920 --> 03:23:20.101]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[03:23:20.101 --> 03:23:20.961]  Do they fund freedom?
[03:23:20.961 --> 03:23:22.081]  No, a lot of them don't.
[03:23:22.081 --> 03:23:28.523]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[03:23:28.523 --> 03:23:30.243]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[03:23:30.243 --> 03:23:33.084]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[03:23:33.664 --> 03:23:36.787]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[03:23:36.787 --> 03:23:47.476]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[03:23:47.476 --> 03:23:50.158]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:04.090 --> 03:24:06.472]  Waging War on Corruption.
[03:24:06.472 --> 03:24:09.173]  It's Gerald Celente.
[03:24:09.173 --> 03:24:11.795]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:11.795 --> 03:24:15.357]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:15.357 --> 03:24:19.079]  And I want to thank the staff for the great job that they do.
[03:24:19.079 --> 03:24:26.064]  And how dedicated everyone is to bringing you freedom, peace, and justice.
[03:24:26.064 --> 03:24:28.145]  And that's our motto.
[03:24:28.145 --> 03:24:30.767]  And it's what InfoWars is doing.
[03:24:32.139 --> 03:24:37.341]  Powell says the Fed remains committed to using all its tools to promote recovery.
[03:24:37.341 --> 03:24:41.622]  That's last Friday.
[03:24:41.622 --> 03:24:58.587]  CNBC Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated his commitment to an all-in approach to the recovery, pledging in a commentary piece for the Wall Street Journal to keep policy loose.
[03:25:00.871 --> 03:25:08.132]  They're buying $120 billion worth of bonds and isn't this a wonderful name?
[03:25:08.132 --> 03:25:12.673]  Mortgage-backed securities.
[03:25:12.673 --> 03:25:18.934]  Keeping the gamblers alive with these low interest rates.
[03:25:18.934 --> 03:25:21.315]  This is not America.
[03:25:21.315 --> 03:25:25.895]  The banksters have taken over in front of our eyes.
[03:25:25.895 --> 03:25:26.575]  Our U.S.
[03:25:26.575 --> 03:25:29.316]  Treasury Secretary is Janet Yellen.
[03:25:30.683 --> 03:25:32.684]  Yeah.
[03:25:32.684 --> 03:25:36.805]  Janet Yellen was the former head of the Federal Reserve.
[03:25:36.805 --> 03:25:39.025]  And it's not federal at all.
[03:25:39.025 --> 03:25:43.067]  That is a BS name.
[03:25:43.067 --> 03:25:47.908]  That's like calling it the Federal Trans Journal.
[03:25:47.908 --> 03:25:49.348]  It's not federal at all.
[03:25:49.348 --> 03:25:53.870]  They're private bank operations.
[03:25:53.870 --> 03:25:58.751]  And now they just brought in this other woman from the Federal Reserve to be her advisor.
[03:26:00.595 --> 03:26:02.435]  And they brought in this guy Lipton.
[03:26:02.435 --> 03:26:07.977]  No, no, not the T. But he's been dunked with the IMF.
[03:26:07.977 --> 03:26:09.017]  Yeah.
[03:26:09.017 --> 03:26:10.197]  He's been there.
[03:26:10.197 --> 03:26:14.278]  This is who's running the Treasury.
[03:26:14.278 --> 03:26:17.799]  It's artificially propped up.
[03:26:17.799 --> 03:26:25.620]  What's very important, and we do it with the Trends Journal, is we look at international affairs very closely.
[03:26:25.620 --> 03:26:29.041]  You go back a few days ago, March 19th,
[03:26:32.618 --> 03:26:38.139]  And... The... There she is, yelling.
[03:26:38.139 --> 03:26:38.839]  Phew!
[03:26:38.839 --> 03:26:41.440]  God, we're the same age, Marron.
[03:26:41.440 --> 03:26:43.940]  Phew!
[03:26:43.940 --> 03:26:46.721]  Well, anyway.
[03:26:46.721 --> 03:26:48.941]  You go back to March 19th.
[03:26:48.941 --> 03:26:55.003]  Turkey boosts interest rates sharply as it looks to stem Leader's Tide.
[03:26:55.003 --> 03:26:56.783]  Slide.
[03:26:56.783 --> 03:27:02.024]  Turkey has sharply increased its main interest rate and moved to aim at halting a slide to the Leader.
[03:27:03.180 --> 03:27:10.762]  That has threatened to pour fuel on inflation that is already running well above the central bank's target.
[03:27:10.762 --> 03:27:18.065]  So, they pushed up interest rates.
[03:27:18.065 --> 03:27:29.848]  Then, two days later, Erdogan, the president, fired the cat that was running the central bank.
[03:27:29.848 --> 03:27:31.689]  And this isn't the first guy he's fired.
[03:27:32.722 --> 03:27:39.126]  Because he doesn't want to raise interest rates because the economy is going to go down.
[03:27:39.126 --> 03:27:46.351]  And inflation is going really high.
[03:27:46.351 --> 03:27:57.639]  So now you're looking at the lira, the Turkish lira, it's plummeted, it's almost at an all-time low against the dollar.
[03:27:57.639 --> 03:27:59.060]  One of my sayings is,
[03:27:59.955 --> 03:28:03.857]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:28:03.857 --> 03:28:06.658]  You know what Erdogan did the next day?
[03:28:06.658 --> 03:28:09.699]  Bombs away over in Syria.
[03:28:09.699 --> 03:28:11.280]  That's right.
[03:28:11.280 --> 03:28:16.182]  That murderous little clown of... Yeah, he invaded Syria.
[03:28:16.182 --> 03:28:17.202]  Parts of Syria.
[03:28:17.202 --> 03:28:21.404]  The United States has another part where he is.
[03:28:21.404 --> 03:28:25.625]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:28:25.625 --> 03:28:26.586]  War.
[03:28:26.586 --> 03:28:28.326]  Huh.
[03:28:28.326 --> 03:28:29.347]  This is March...
[03:28:31.443 --> 03:28:52.478]  22nd wasn't right around this time, a thing called the Iraq War that was launched by the United States by another little low life piece of scum, garbage, daddy's boy crap, George W. Bush.
[03:28:52.478 --> 03:28:53.779]  That's right.
[03:28:53.779 --> 03:28:55.340]  A little boy of nothing.
[03:28:56.693 --> 03:29:07.275]  Alfred E. Newman Magazine, Mad Magazine clown, brought to life that lies us into the Iraq War.
[03:29:07.275 --> 03:29:19.357]  Out of the news, out of the news, a little nothing of a gutless clown, a clown right in front of everybody's eyes.
[03:29:19.357 --> 03:29:22.638]  Not a word, not a word about the war.
[03:29:23.487 --> 03:29:26.168]  He's the lowlife that started the Afghan War.
[03:29:26.168 --> 03:29:28.028]  You know what was going on in the Afghan War then?
[03:29:28.028 --> 03:29:32.069]  The United States was in recession, going down deep.
[03:29:32.069 --> 03:29:36.591]  The dot-com bust just happened in 2000.
[03:29:36.591 --> 03:29:40.912]  He takes office in 2001.
[03:29:40.912 --> 03:29:42.332]  It's going down.
[03:29:42.332 --> 03:29:49.394]  But hey, everybody's mind got off the going down when the Afghan War heated up and then the Iraq War.
[03:29:52.023 --> 03:29:54.624]  Artificially propping it up.
[03:29:54.624 --> 03:29:56.005]  And now what do we have?
[03:29:56.005 --> 03:30:00.887]  The panic of 08.
[03:30:00.887 --> 03:30:06.670]  This is the same low-life garbage boy.
[03:30:06.670 --> 03:30:07.750]  Daddy's boy.
[03:30:07.750 --> 03:30:09.531]  I hate these daddy's boys.
[03:30:09.531 --> 03:30:11.232]  Yes, the word hate.
[03:30:11.232 --> 03:30:12.713]  H-A-T-E.
[03:30:12.713 --> 03:30:17.675]  I hate these arrogant little nothings that are born on third base and thought they had a home run.
[03:30:18.365 --> 03:30:22.366]  There'd be nobody like Mario Cuomo, wasn't there Andy?
[03:30:22.366 --> 03:30:24.487]  And Chrissy?
[03:30:24.487 --> 03:30:28.168]  And 2-0-0-Doughboy?
[03:30:28.168 --> 03:30:30.248]  One after another.
[03:30:30.248 --> 03:30:31.849]  There he is.
[03:30:31.849 --> 03:30:33.449]  Our president.
[03:30:33.449 --> 03:30:35.670]  Lying us into the Iraq War.
[03:30:35.670 --> 03:30:37.050]  Killing a million people.
[03:30:37.050 --> 03:30:43.932]  Causing us the taxpayers trillions of dollars to give to the military-industrial complex.
[03:30:43.932 --> 03:30:46.753]  And the slimy, prostitute media
[03:30:47.876 --> 03:31:04.907]  Quote him last week of how unsettling it was for him to see what was going on on January 6th in Washington DC.
[03:31:04.907 --> 03:31:15.433]  Quoting that liar who should be in Guantanamo for his war crimes.
[03:31:15.433 --> 03:31:16.574]  People don't care about the
[03:31:17.455 --> 03:31:18.636]  Millions?
[03:31:18.636 --> 03:31:21.677]  I was sick to my stomach!
[03:31:21.677 --> 03:31:22.677]  What stomach?
[03:31:22.677 --> 03:31:26.239]  You're a gutless little clown!
[03:31:26.239 --> 03:31:29.140]  I was sick to your stomach?
[03:31:29.140 --> 03:31:33.022]  How about sick for leading us into the war?
[03:31:33.022 --> 03:31:35.103]  Lying us into the war!
[03:31:35.103 --> 03:31:39.104]  Not a peep from the prostitutes!
[03:31:39.104 --> 03:31:44.907]  Do you know where America ranks according to free speech in the press?
[03:31:46.582 --> 03:31:50.325]  I just looked it up because I was looking at Algeria's.
[03:31:50.325 --> 03:31:55.309]  We're covering Algeria because there's a youth revolution going on there.
[03:31:55.309 --> 03:32:00.093]  They're like a hundred and twenty.
[03:32:00.093 --> 03:32:07.319]  America's like forty-fifth to forty-six down the line in free press.
[03:32:07.319 --> 03:32:15.065]  And you could thank that other slimy, low-life character, murderous, he should rot in hell, Bill Clinton.
[03:32:16.115 --> 03:32:20.077]  The wars that he gave us, the people he killed in Iraq.
[03:32:20.077 --> 03:32:24.100]  You like that Serbian war, huh?
[03:32:24.100 --> 03:32:25.261]  The deregulating.
[03:32:25.261 --> 03:32:33.005]  The Federal Communications Act in 1996.
[03:32:33.005 --> 03:32:34.926]  That gave all the power to the bigs.
[03:32:34.926 --> 03:32:41.630]  We now have six companies controlling over 90% of the media.
[03:32:41.630 --> 03:32:42.471]  That's America.
[03:32:43.664 --> 03:32:47.828]  And that's why you need to support InfoWars.
[03:32:47.828 --> 03:32:59.158]  Because they are robbing us of our freedom in front of our eyes and propping up low-life murderers like little Georgie Bush.
[03:32:59.158 --> 03:33:03.542]  Not a word about the Iraq War.
[03:33:03.542 --> 03:33:04.563]  So do what you can.
[03:33:04.563 --> 03:33:07.226]  The sails are on.
[03:33:09.577 --> 03:33:15.220]  They're gonna do everything they can to shut down Infowars and censor Trends Journal.
[03:33:15.220 --> 03:33:21.323]  Matter of fact, Gregory Manarino just got... unliked on LinkedIn.
[03:33:21.323 --> 03:33:22.923]  Him!
[03:33:22.923 --> 03:33:27.205]  What does he do?
[03:33:27.205 --> 03:33:32.848]  We must unite for peace, because they're robbing us of our freedom.
[03:33:32.848 --> 03:33:37.150]  Of course, unless you get your passport, that you've been vaccinated.
[03:33:37.150 --> 03:33:39.271]  Yeah, and maybe terminated.
[03:33:40.692 --> 03:33:42.193]  Having tested the thing.
[03:33:42.193 --> 03:33:43.694]  That's okay.
[03:33:43.694 --> 03:33:57.344]  The ultimate fluoride-free charcoal mouthwash is now available at InfoWarsStore.com and DrJonesNaturals.com for the lowest price possible to complete your daily mouth cleaning routine.

[03:34:43.263 --> 03:34:48.924]  The New World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world government.
[03:34:48.924 --> 03:34:52.205]  But world government is only the control grid.
[03:34:52.205 --> 03:34:59.726]  Now, inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods and attain immortality.
[03:34:59.726 --> 03:35:06.768]  But the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon-based life forms.
[03:35:06.768 --> 03:35:08.988]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[03:35:08.988 --> 03:35:12.229]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[03:35:12.729 --> 03:35:14.612]  They are playing God.
[03:35:14.612 --> 03:35:24.503]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology to carry out this transformation.
[03:35:24.503 --> 03:35:29.810]  I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings of the Globalist, it's all on record.
[03:35:29.810 --> 03:35:30.971]  You have been warned.
[03:35:32.232 --> 03:35:36.676]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[03:35:36.676 --> 03:35:40.279]  This is the end of all life on Earth as we know it.
[03:35:40.279 --> 03:35:48.606]  This is the alien takeover of Earth.
[03:35:48.606 --> 03:35:49.767]  Rani Durite.
[03:35:49.767 --> 03:35:50.547]  Rani Durite.
[03:35:50.547 --> 03:35:51.288]  Thanks for holding her on.
[03:35:54.294 --> 03:35:55.175]  I love your products.
[03:35:55.175 --> 03:36:06.025]  I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[03:36:06.025 --> 03:36:12.031]  But since taking Urex 2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[03:36:12.031 --> 03:36:13.091]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[03:36:15.313 --> 03:36:23.039]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[03:36:23.039 --> 03:36:31.786]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[03:36:31.786 --> 03:36:32.626]  This is working.
[03:36:32.626 --> 03:36:33.607]  This is wonderful.
[03:36:33.607 --> 03:36:38.150]  You know, I don't, I don't have to put on Dermablend anymore, you know.
[03:36:38.150 --> 03:36:42.794]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully, and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[03:36:47.294 --> 03:36:52.561]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us.
[03:36:52.561 --> 03:36:59.409]  Not just tracking and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well.
[03:36:59.409 --> 03:37:01.051]  With or without a battery.
[03:37:01.833 --> 03:37:07.918]  Now, with the Infowars Privacy Pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[03:37:07.918 --> 03:37:08.798]  Excellent.
[03:37:08.798 --> 03:37:14.382]  Now I have my own compact Faraday cage I can take wherever I want.
[03:37:14.382 --> 03:37:18.985]  And you can too, at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:37:18.985 --> 03:37:24.990]  Government agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now contact tracers.
[03:37:25.730 --> 03:37:29.731]  Are all tracking your every move through your mobile phone.
[03:37:29.731 --> 03:37:34.673]  Now you can have the power to easily cut them off and go dark.
[03:37:34.673 --> 03:37:40.555]  Support the InfoWar and get your InfoWars privacy pouch today.

[03:38:35.990 --> 03:38:41.132]  As I said, you know, whether it's subscribing to the Trends Journal, there's no magazine like it in the world.
[03:38:41.132 --> 03:38:42.673]  Nothing comes close to it.
[03:38:42.673 --> 03:38:45.775]  What's going on, what it means, what's next, trend forecasts.
[03:38:47.766 --> 03:38:49.247]  Nothing like it.
[03:38:49.247 --> 03:38:52.067]  And of course InfoWars.
[03:38:52.067 --> 03:38:53.768]  It's great being on InfoWars.

[03:40:47.784 --> 03:40:50.366]  Because we're going down.
[03:40:50.366 --> 03:40:51.807]  Right in front of our eyes.
[03:40:51.807 --> 03:40:52.948]  Again.
[03:40:52.948 --> 03:40:55.570]  You look at the faces of the freaks running the show.
[03:40:55.570 --> 03:40:57.871]  Oh, I like Nancy Pelosi.
[03:40:57.871 --> 03:41:00.233]  No, Diane Nassau Feinstein's for me.
[03:41:00.233 --> 03:41:03.455]  Oh no, Mitch McConnell's my kind of guy.
[03:41:03.455 --> 03:41:06.738]  Oh no, I like Lindsey Graham.
[03:41:06.738 --> 03:41:08.139]  What a freak show!
[03:41:09.051 --> 03:41:10.312]  Look around.
[03:41:10.312 --> 03:41:12.514]  Look who's running a show.
[03:41:12.514 --> 03:41:14.556]  State, city, country.
[03:41:14.556 --> 03:41:16.237]  I like Boris Johnson.
[03:41:16.237 --> 03:41:17.678]  Yeah.
[03:41:17.678 --> 03:41:19.540]  What a jerk.
[03:41:19.540 --> 03:41:22.743]  How about little Macron over there in France?
[03:41:22.743 --> 03:41:25.825]  Another little boy of nothing.
[03:41:25.825 --> 03:41:31.130]  It's one big club and you ain't in it, as George Collins said.
[03:41:31.130 --> 03:41:36.114]  And as I keep saying, we said from the beginning when they launched the COVID war, they're making this stuff up.
[03:41:37.210 --> 03:41:40.692]  So what was the big news over the weekend?
[03:41:40.692 --> 03:41:46.754]  Well, the CDC said, you only have to be 3 feet away, not 6 feet away.
[03:41:46.754 --> 03:41:53.357]  No kidding.
[03:41:53.357 --> 03:41:54.057]  No kidding.
[03:41:54.057 --> 03:41:57.619]  They're making it up.
[03:41:57.619 --> 03:42:01.800]  The costs go like 27 feet.
[03:42:01.800 --> 03:42:05.502]  You see the facts, we write about them, they have them on InfoWars as well.
[03:42:06.207 --> 03:42:08.028]  Masks don't work.
[03:42:08.028 --> 03:42:10.509]  Forget the Denmark study in November.
[03:42:10.509 --> 03:42:12.470]  It doesn't mean anything.
[03:42:12.470 --> 03:42:14.131]  That shows they're useless.
[03:42:14.131 --> 03:42:24.795]  Forget that the World Health Organization, CDC, and fat-mouthed fraud Fauci, the little arrogant boy.
[03:42:24.795 --> 03:42:26.096]  Again, an Italian.
[03:42:26.096 --> 03:42:28.257]  I'm ashamed of the Italians.
[03:42:28.257 --> 03:42:31.198]  Cuomo, Fauci, Draghi.
[03:42:31.198 --> 03:42:32.519]  What Draghi?
[03:42:32.519 --> 03:42:33.139]  Dracula.
[03:42:34.989 --> 03:42:42.152]  Fat Mouth Fauci on CBS back in March saying, no, you don't have to wear the masks.
[03:42:42.152 --> 03:42:51.196]  The CDC saying that in restaurants, but it only, you know, it only brings down the infection rate by 1.1, 3, 2 percent.
[03:42:51.196 --> 03:42:54.078]  Yeah, fill him up Cuomo over there, right?
[03:42:54.078 --> 03:42:56.159]  And what did he say in the restaurants?
[03:42:56.159 --> 03:42:59.180]  Infection rates only about 1.4 percent.
[03:42:59.180 --> 03:43:01.261]  But yet, I'm the governor!
[03:43:01.261 --> 03:43:03.142]  I'm the governor!
[03:43:04.364 --> 03:43:08.066]  I'm gonna lock down your restaurants!
[03:43:08.066 --> 03:43:14.288]  And I'm gonna give you the capacity numbers!
[03:43:14.288 --> 03:43:15.529]  That's right.
[03:43:15.529 --> 03:43:18.470]  Former CDC Commissioner.
[03:43:18.470 --> 03:43:20.230]  That's the other clown boy.
[03:43:20.230 --> 03:43:22.311]  What's his name, Gottlieb?
[03:43:22.311 --> 03:43:23.612]  Yeah.
[03:43:23.612 --> 03:43:25.493]  Grosslieb.
[03:43:25.493 --> 03:43:30.775]  He was shooting off his fat mouth last year.
[03:43:30.775 --> 03:43:32.796]  Calling for six feet.
[03:43:32.796 --> 03:43:33.716]  Social distance.
[03:43:35.242 --> 03:43:36.182]  You got it?
[03:43:36.182 --> 03:43:39.484]  They're bureaucraps!
[03:43:39.484 --> 03:43:44.526]  These are people that never had real jobs!
[03:43:44.526 --> 03:43:47.188]  They're part of a system!
[03:43:47.188 --> 03:43:54.071]  Again, as George Collins said, the one big club and you ain't in it.
[03:43:54.071 --> 03:43:55.391]  Wait!
[03:43:55.391 --> 03:44:00.434]  The billionaires around the world added four
[03:44:01.670 --> 03:44:09.651]  Trillion dollars to their portfolios since the COVID war was launched.
[03:44:09.651 --> 03:44:14.612]  While the rest of everybody else goes broke.
[03:44:14.612 --> 03:44:15.813]  The bigs got bigger.
[03:44:15.813 --> 03:44:21.054]  They're going to merge the Canada Railway with the Americans now.
[03:44:21.054 --> 03:44:22.214]  Oh, great.
[03:44:22.214 --> 03:44:22.894]  Great.
[03:44:22.894 --> 03:44:24.914]  Third world system.
[03:44:24.914 --> 03:44:26.254]  Oh.
[03:44:26.254 --> 03:44:28.995]  Great, by the way, that intro before I came on the air.
[03:44:30.086 --> 03:44:35.290]  The news overview by Infowars, and they talked about Blinken.
[03:44:35.290 --> 03:44:36.591]  Blinken.
[03:44:36.591 --> 03:44:39.813]  Yeah, Blinken, our US Secretary of State.
[03:44:39.813 --> 03:44:42.075]  Again, guy been a club member his whole life.
[03:44:42.075 --> 03:44:53.524]  This is the guy that Obama, the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner, when Saudi Arabia announced the war, that they were going to invade Yemen back in 2015 from Washington DC.
[03:44:56.016 --> 03:45:08.038]  Lincoln was the guy that went over there to help the Saudis slaughter the Yemenis by giving them American intelligence, refueling their planes, the Saudi planes, so they could bomb the hell out of the people.
[03:45:08.038 --> 03:45:13.779]  Anyway, did you see what the Chinese did to him?
[03:45:13.779 --> 03:45:17.400]  They leveled him out.
[03:45:17.400 --> 03:45:19.080]  You look at our top trends for 2021.
[03:45:19.080 --> 03:45:23.401]  This is going to be the Chinese century.
[03:45:25.319 --> 03:45:27.000]  I talked about the train deal.
[03:45:27.000 --> 03:45:29.462]  They just did.
[03:45:29.462 --> 03:45:34.026]  With... What is it?
[03:45:34.026 --> 03:45:43.273]  Canadian Pacific Railway Limited agreed to acquire Kansas City Southern in a transaction valued at about $25 billion.
[03:45:43.273 --> 03:45:49.318]  And of course that's industrial rail.
[03:45:49.318 --> 03:45:50.719]  Look at China's rail system.
[03:45:51.704 --> 03:45:54.285]  Bullet trains, high-speed trains.
[03:45:54.285 --> 03:45:55.606]  You go to New York!
[03:45:55.606 --> 03:45:58.067]  Clown Cuomo!
[03:45:58.067 --> 03:45:59.287]  Wilhelm!
[03:45:59.287 --> 03:46:00.408]  Not de Blasio!
[03:46:00.408 --> 03:46:01.909]  His real name's Wilhelm!
[03:46:01.909 --> 03:46:06.691]  He uses the de Blasio name to get the Italian votes!
[03:46:06.691 --> 03:46:08.111]  Mayor de Blasio!
[03:46:08.111 --> 03:46:10.612]  Piece of scum, de Blasio!
[03:46:10.612 --> 03:46:12.373]  Look at the New York subway!
[03:46:12.373 --> 03:46:17.335]  It's a night in Calcutta!
[03:46:17.335 --> 03:46:18.836]  The Chinese are taking over!
[03:46:22.068 --> 03:46:28.171]  And by the way, stop this anti-Asian stuff going on.
[03:46:28.171 --> 03:46:41.537]  Don't blame the Asian people for crazy people running their country, just like you don't want to blame Americans for the murderers like George W. Bush, like Bill Clinton, like Barack Obama.
[03:46:41.537 --> 03:46:43.338]  So cool out with this.
[03:46:43.338 --> 03:46:47.399]  The Chinese government's a different deal.
[03:46:47.399 --> 03:46:48.560]  And they're in charge.
[03:46:50.345 --> 03:46:53.847]  The business of China is business.
[03:46:53.847 --> 03:46:56.809]  The business of America has been war.
[03:46:56.809 --> 03:46:58.651]  And we're paying for it.
[03:46:58.651 --> 03:47:10.579]  Eisenhower warned us the military-industrial complex would destroy the nation, rob us of the genius of the scientists, sweat of the laborers, and future of the children, and here we are!
[03:47:10.579 --> 03:47:15.182]  How low can you go?
[03:47:15.182 --> 03:47:16.083]  How low can you go?
[03:47:16.083 --> 03:47:19.285]  You can't go up a flight of stairs, Biden, without falling down.
[03:47:22.321 --> 03:47:25.302]  And that's what America is.
[03:47:25.302 --> 03:47:28.663]  The Chinese laughed at Blinken.
[03:47:28.663 --> 03:47:31.064]  They don't need us.
[03:47:31.064 --> 03:47:33.504]  They're taking over.
[03:47:33.504 --> 03:47:46.468]  Unless, unless we bring liberty, justice, and peace back to America.
[03:47:46.468 --> 03:47:48.289]  Because it's being robbed from us.
[03:47:49.665 --> 03:47:53.566]  They destroyed our Constitution with their executive orders.
[03:47:53.566 --> 03:47:57.047]  Little boy Murphy closing down Jersey again.
[03:47:57.047 --> 03:48:02.129]  A little wolf of nothing in Pennsylvania.
[03:48:02.129 --> 03:48:03.169]  Jerks!
[03:48:03.169 --> 03:48:04.310]  Morons!
[03:48:04.310 --> 03:48:08.371]  Arrogant little boys and girls!
[03:48:08.371 --> 03:48:10.932]  It's up to you.
[03:48:10.932 --> 03:48:11.652]  Do your part.
[03:48:12.904 --> 03:48:16.727]  Get in the best shape you can, physically, emotionally and spiritually.
[03:48:16.727 --> 03:48:17.948]  Support InfoWars.
[03:48:17.948 --> 03:48:20.109]  Subscribe to the Trends Journal.
[03:48:20.109 --> 03:48:22.751]  Keep truth alive.
[03:48:22.751 --> 03:48:26.834]  Because if we don't, it's going to be hell on earth.
[03:48:26.834 --> 03:48:28.215]  It's right in front of our eyes.
