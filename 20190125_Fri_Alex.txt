[00:34.360 --> 00:42.220]  gentlemen this is a world exclusive info wars.com reporter patriot former
[00:42.220 --> 00:48.200]  chief advisor to Donald Trump Roger Stone was SWAT team rated in a disgusting
[00:48.200 --> 00:54.080]  act of police state theater by the now politicized arm of the deep state the
[00:54.080 --> 00:59.160]  FBI and a pre-dawn raid that CNN of course has been tipped off to with the
[00:59.160 --> 01:04.160]  reporter lying on TV like a Cheshire cat saying that he hadn't been well Roger
[01:04.160 --> 01:08.120]  Stone last night predicted to me he said I think they're coming for me tomorrow
[01:08.120 --> 01:13.040]  he said I can just feel it I can see it all the preparation everything and he
[01:13.040 --> 01:16.880]  sent me a text message saying they're preparing to move in for the kill and boy
[01:16.880 --> 01:20.880]  was he right so Roger Stone exclusively joins us this is the first
[01:20.880 --> 01:27.080]  interview world exclusive right now he just bonded out about 30 minutes ago
[01:27.080 --> 01:30.600]  world exclusive Roger thanks for joining us and you've got the floor
[01:30.600 --> 01:36.920]  obviously for this segment the next and please let it out Alex I can say I've
[01:36.920 --> 01:43.400]  had greater better moments better mornings shall we say where should we
[01:43.400 --> 01:46.960]  start with how you're able to predict this last night over the phone what
[01:46.960 --> 01:51.160]  happened this morning what happened once they got into your house and then
[01:51.160 --> 01:55.720]  where you what happened once you were in jail then what unfolded after that the
[01:55.720 --> 02:00.600]  important thing I think off the bat is and after a two-year investigation none
[02:00.600 --> 02:05.400]  of these charges relate to rushing collusion or WikiLeaks collaboration or
[02:05.400 --> 02:11.400]  any other illegal act connected to the 2060 in election
[02:11.400 --> 02:17.280]  misleading the Congress in my testimony on matters that are
[02:17.280 --> 02:23.600]  really immaterial and which there is no intent any error I did make would have
[02:23.600 --> 02:29.400]  been inconsequential and it would have been inadvertent secondarily there are
[02:29.400 --> 02:35.520]  false charges of witness intimidation if this is a political politically
[02:35.520 --> 02:43.120]  motivated result and particularly calling is the fact that the special
[02:43.120 --> 02:47.640]  council put out a press release prior to purifying my attorneys that I would be
[02:47.640 --> 02:56.280]  charged and this morning completely unnecessarily 29 fbf
[02:58.400 --> 03:01.920]  Roger you're obviously getting a lot of calls on that phone it's breaking up
[03:01.920 --> 03:05.840]  let's start over you're saying it 29 fbi
[03:07.240 --> 03:13.520]  the terror terrorized not only my wife but my dogs please describe what happened
[03:13.520 --> 03:21.680]  because your phones been breaking up repeat you said 29 29 FBI agents showed
[03:21.680 --> 03:27.560]  up at my home pounded on the door I opened the door to you know pointed
[03:27.560 --> 03:34.840]  automatic weapons I was handcuffed there were I don't know 17 vehicles in the
[03:34.840 --> 03:41.640]  street with their light John they terrorized my wife and my dogs they
[03:41.640 --> 03:48.520]  executed a search warrant to search the premises and CNN was was present so
[03:48.520 --> 03:54.920]  clearly CNN was tipped off prior to my arrest unbelievable world is close to
[03:54.920 --> 03:57.680]  Roger we're gonna go to break in a moment and come back and and let you
[03:57.680 --> 04:01.600]  walk through what happened after that but the idea of 29 armed men in a
[04:01.600 --> 04:05.840]  pre-dawn raid these are the same Democratic Party run FBI that say that
[04:05.840 --> 04:09.400]  MS-13 are God's children and none of them should be checked coming across the
[04:09.400 --> 04:12.240]  border but you a man with no criminal record has worked for multiple
[04:12.240 --> 04:18.600]  administrations you get just a El Chapo level raid well clearly they could have
[04:18.600 --> 04:24.000]  just contacted my attorneys and I would have voluntarily turned myself in I was
[04:24.000 --> 04:29.080]  then taken to the FBI facility where I was fingerprinted the FBI was
[04:29.080 --> 04:34.080]  extraordinarily courteous I have no complaints with them but you know it
[04:34.080 --> 04:37.800]  was it was unnecessary it was it meant to intimidate me but I am not
[04:37.800 --> 04:46.080]  intimidated you know I I now obviously will be arraigned in DC sometime next
[04:46.080 --> 04:50.520]  week and then I intend to vigorously fight the charges because they are

[07:02.280 --> 07:05.720]  because your phone was breaking up earlier repeat what happened again because
[07:05.720 --> 07:09.160]  it was clear during the break repeat what exactly what happened this morning
[07:09.160 --> 07:13.000]  and then move through what's really happened with this indictment clearly
[07:13.000 --> 07:16.200]  they're getting ready to move on Trump next and where you see all this going
[07:16.200 --> 07:19.520]  and how they're trying to bankrupt you as well because people now need to
[07:19.520 --> 07:22.680]  understand how serious this is and donate to your defense fund so Roger walk
[07:22.680 --> 07:28.480]  through it please. Sure approximately the crack of dawn around just before 6
[07:28.480 --> 07:38.400]  a.m. 29 FBI agents with 17 vehicles with all of their lights flashing pounded on
[07:38.400 --> 07:44.840]  the door both my wife and I up I came to the door they were pointing weapons at
[07:44.840 --> 07:49.840]  me demanding that I open the door the door has a window I did they took me
[07:49.840 --> 07:55.720]  outside where I was handcuffed and then they went upstairs to find my wife they
[07:55.720 --> 08:00.640]  scared the daylights out of her and the dogs they asked me if I had any weapons
[08:00.640 --> 08:07.440]  in the home I do not but they allowed me to dress and then I was taken to the
[08:07.440 --> 08:17.440]  FBI processing facility in Miami-Dade County where I was fingerprinted and the
[08:17.440 --> 08:23.800]  FBI was exceedingly courteous I want to say and they treated me very well then I
[08:23.800 --> 08:29.280]  was taken from there to the federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale where I
[08:29.280 --> 08:36.480]  had to go to a bond hearing wearing shackles hands and feet no cameras were
[08:36.480 --> 08:41.760]  allowed in the in the proceeding representative from the special
[08:41.760 --> 08:46.840]  counsel's office at the U.S. Attorney's Office and my attorneys jointly agreed to
[08:46.840 --> 08:55.360]  a $250,000 bond which I will be released I had to wait for you know in a cell
[08:55.360 --> 09:03.080]  holding cell for processing and I have now just come out it is as you know Alex
[09:03.080 --> 09:08.080]  they have attempted to destroy me financially prior to this so that I
[09:08.080 --> 09:12.160]  hopefully they would like me to plead guilty to charges that are completely
[09:12.160 --> 09:16.920]  bogus you know I there's no Russian collusion there's no WikiLeaks
[09:16.920 --> 09:22.360]  collaboration there's no allegation that I received anything from WikiLeaks or
[09:22.360 --> 09:28.160]  Julian Assange or anyone else and
[09:29.160 --> 09:36.240]  I want to pledge it full statements to the Congress and I contest all of them
[09:36.240 --> 09:42.120]  and my testimony would be honest mistakes the memory and they would be
[09:42.120 --> 09:48.760]  immaterial they would be inconsequential so that you know it's a political I
[09:48.760 --> 09:55.320]  think it's a politically motivated well well Roger I've talked a lot of
[09:55.320 --> 09:59.360]  national members I've talked a lot of national members of the press today who
[09:59.360 --> 10:04.560]  were just flabbergasted right now because they've read the indictment and
[10:04.560 --> 10:09.280]  you have Randy Kredico saying he was talking to Assange and that he was the
[10:09.280 --> 10:13.120]  go-between I remember back at the time this being discussed you said you knew
[10:13.120 --> 10:17.160]  a talk show host that new lawyers from WikiLeaks everybody was trying to talk
[10:17.160 --> 10:20.760]  to WikiLeaks so again we talked about this a million times this is this is
[10:20.760 --> 10:25.640]  making journalism illegal and if the press doesn't circle the wagons and see
[10:25.640 --> 10:30.200]  how dangerous this is it's insane and now as you know I've got Washington Times
[10:30.200 --> 10:35.440]  Washington Post AP all these reports about witnesses special counsel probe
[10:35.440 --> 10:39.320]  former stone associate collected payments from info wars through job stone
[10:39.320 --> 10:43.240]  arranged I have that my phone ringing off the hook saying did you make the
[10:43.240 --> 10:47.560]  hush money are you going to prison so now employing people and then giving
[10:47.560 --> 10:50.640]  them a severance pay with that's in their contract because that's what he
[10:50.640 --> 10:54.160]  wanted to work here he made a pretty good deal for himself but I had to let
[10:54.160 --> 10:57.560]  him go because I don't like his writing anymore just wasn't accurate course he
[10:57.560 --> 11:01.560]  now admits okay it was severance pay earlier he was saying actually it was
[11:01.560 --> 11:04.800]  something else but the point is they're now moving on to me and my father and my
[11:04.800 --> 11:09.920]  spidey sense tells me they mean to move on us to take info wars out and to take
[11:09.920 --> 11:14.600]  any support for the president out because they know we got president Trump
[11:14.600 --> 11:24.120]  elected yeah now Alex look you're absolutely right it is it's an
[11:24.120 --> 11:27.600]  absurdity they've tried to hurt my position there at info wars they've
[11:27.600 --> 11:34.800]  made false allegations regarding your compensation to Jerry coursey yet yet
[11:34.800 --> 11:39.480]  none of that is reflected in the charges brought today these charges are
[11:39.480 --> 11:44.560]  thin to say the least but they seek to destroy me I need people to go to
[11:44.560 --> 11:50.240]  stonedefensefund.com now I really need people's help because I'm going to be
[11:50.240 --> 11:54.600]  facing a trial in the district of Columbia and I intend to fight for my
[11:54.600 --> 11:58.560]  life there's no circumstance under which I would plead guilty to these charges
[11:58.560 --> 12:02.400]  there's no circumstance in which I would bear false witness against the
[12:02.400 --> 12:08.400]  president it's not going to do that. Roger I want to get into some news with you
[12:08.400 --> 12:11.000]  here and we've got a break for a few minutes and we go to that huge press
[12:11.000 --> 12:14.800]  conference but they most of them are the enemy they're gonna try to edit things
[12:14.800 --> 12:18.120]  out of context so this is really your chance to have long-form talk about the
[12:18.120 --> 12:21.880]  reality of what's unfolded here but the president a few months ago said you have
[12:21.880 --> 12:26.800]  a lot of courage and it's good to hear that you won't lie for them he also has
[12:26.800 --> 12:29.360]  pointed out this is the greatest witch hunt in history and of course there's
[12:29.360 --> 12:33.720]  no Russia collusion no Russia nothing they're saying that you lied to Congress
[12:33.720 --> 12:38.480]  that you didn't directly talk to Assange well I mean this is just the most
[12:38.480 --> 12:44.680]  insane crap ever and this is all they've got it's just crazy and it never
[12:44.680 --> 12:49.000]  seems to end so what does the president need to do Mueller is this power to
[12:49.000 --> 12:53.080]  himself on tarmacs with uranium the uranium one the Clintons billions of
[12:53.080 --> 12:56.440]  dollars hundreds of millions for the uranium they're all on these boards
[12:56.440 --> 12:59.840]  with Russian companies Muller is and then meanwhile you have no Russia
[12:59.840 --> 13:03.440]  connection and you just bonded out for quarter million dollars and are facing
[13:03.440 --> 13:08.120]  many years in prison I mean this is this is cartoonish this is beyond a witch
[13:08.120 --> 13:13.160]  hunt it's an inquisition well and if people want to know exactly what's
[13:13.160 --> 13:16.600]  going on they want to see my full statement if they want to keep up to date
[13:16.600 --> 13:21.600]  on on what's going on they should keep focused on info wars because we will
[13:21.600 --> 13:28.480]  bring the whole story the whole truth unlike CNN and some of the censored or
[13:28.480 --> 13:33.640]  I should say controlled corporate media Roger there's a lot of points to make
[13:33.640 --> 13:38.360]  sure at the time we have what do you expect to come next in the witch hunt
[13:38.360 --> 13:41.480]  you've been pretty accurate at guessing who's coming next it looks like they're
[13:41.480 --> 13:45.160]  expanding the witch hunt not contracting it while telling the president that he's
[13:45.160 --> 13:49.480]  not the target when the internal documents show he is the target yeah I
[13:49.480 --> 13:53.480]  still believe that that is the bottom line my attorneys have not yet had
[13:53.480 --> 13:58.120]  conversations with the special counsel as you know prior to my arrest this
[13:58.120 --> 14:03.960]  morning we had no contact at all so we kind of we have to wait and see I would
[14:03.960 --> 14:08.240]  predict that they want me to bear false witness against the president I'm just
[14:08.240 --> 14:11.680]  telling you that's something I'm not going to be pressured into doing as long
[14:11.680 --> 14:15.720]  as I have a breath in my body and the dollar to pay a lawyer I'm gonna fight I
[14:15.720 --> 14:19.640]  will fight I will not quit what is your statement to the president he's
[14:19.640 --> 14:23.320]  undoubtedly going to be watching this or is watching it this is top linked on
[14:23.320 --> 14:29.800]  drudgerport.com what do you want to say to the president once again there is no
[14:29.800 --> 14:33.880]  evidence of rushing collusion which elix collaboration and I'm not charged
[14:33.880 --> 14:40.120]  doing anything inappropriate or illegal to assist in his election even though I
[14:40.120 --> 14:47.040]  think I'm being persecuted for being a 40-year friend and supporter of his now
[14:47.040 --> 14:50.920]  Roger we're told now there's over 500 reporters waiting for you let's let them
[14:50.920 --> 14:54.680]  keep waiting like the president does and and build this up because they can't
[14:54.680 --> 14:57.880]  stand you're here unedited live we're going to break do five more minutes

[15:11.120 --> 15:15.280]  house and pointed guns at you they terrorized you and this has got a lot of
[15:15.280 --> 15:17.960]  law enforcement I know including federal law enforcement who are good guys
[15:17.960 --> 15:22.240]  calling me saying they're so disgusted right now
[15:22.480 --> 15:27.040]  and look at every attorney I know who has read this indictment and been in
[15:27.040 --> 15:31.320]  touch with my lawyers think it is a joke they think it is thin to say the
[15:31.320 --> 15:35.400]  least when we come back let's specifically get into how you felt

[20:20.120 --> 20:26.920]  lines of the info war singing in Fox News they're all having connection fits
[20:26.920 --> 20:31.120]  because they're all part of the deep state at the top and they want to hear
[20:31.120 --> 20:33.880]  Stone's statement they want to misrepresent it but here he is live
[20:33.880 --> 20:39.680]  Roger Stone exclusively with us only drudge report calm would dare link to
[20:39.680 --> 20:43.440]  actually hear what he has to say drudge report calm has a top link in
[20:43.440 --> 20:47.520]  fours calm has a top link and you better believe later today during the war

[20:50.440 --> 20:55.080]  that counts we have the entire corporate media trying to take us off the
[20:55.080 --> 20:59.200]  year trying to silence us all these Soros funded lawsuits battling to shut
[20:59.200 --> 21:04.840]  down info wars battling to destroy Roger Stone because we got Stone elected I
[21:04.840 --> 21:09.280]  mean we got President Trump elected Roger Stone this operation our listeners
[21:09.280 --> 21:15.600]  and that's a fact so we're being destroyed in slow motion and being lynched
[21:15.600 --> 21:19.440]  by the corporate media who claimed that they are actually journalists because
[21:19.440 --> 21:23.280]  they're all part of this system so Roger you have the floor to the real world
[21:23.280 --> 21:26.680]  right now to make the statements they're in camp at your house the FBI's put a
[21:26.680 --> 21:31.600]  big tarp up so the helicopters can show it they're moving in to your home
[21:31.600 --> 21:34.960]  looking for anything they can obviously there's nothing this is so
[21:34.960 --> 21:38.840]  historic so Roger World Exclusive your thoughts about what's happening what's
[21:38.840 --> 21:41.360]  unfolding
[21:44.760 --> 21:50.360]  getting back on and his phone has people calling it boom boom boom boom boom boom
[21:50.360 --> 21:53.560]  boom boom and I wouldn't be surprised they didn't break into it and cut it off
[21:53.560 --> 21:57.400]  we've had a lot of that go on I mean my phone all the time such dialing people
[21:57.400 --> 22:04.080]  and going places and doing things it's insane absolutely insane
[22:05.680 --> 22:09.960]  okay Roger is back Roger your phone dropped Roger you the whole world's
[22:09.960 --> 22:12.680]  watching and listening right now what do you want to tell the world about what's
[22:12.680 --> 22:16.680]  happening with your fake indictment well first of all actually you wouldn't
[22:16.680 --> 22:21.560]  I believe the scene I'm looking at outside, there must be 500, 600 reporters out there.
[22:21.560 --> 22:25.760]  But we're exclusive here at InfoWars.
[22:25.760 --> 22:30.440]  I predicted for many months that I would be framed on some process charge that they would
[22:30.440 --> 22:36.200]  find no evidence of Russian collusion or WikiLeaks collaboration, that they would take things
[22:36.200 --> 22:40.760]  that are clearly activities on my part, which are covered by the First Amendment, and try
[22:40.760 --> 22:42.120]  to criminalize them.
[22:42.120 --> 22:47.840]  And in essence, criminalizing political activity, what people need to understand is that I am
[22:47.840 --> 22:53.560]  innocent, that the whole Russian collusion investigation is a distraction from the real
[22:53.560 --> 22:56.880]  crimes of the Clintons and the Obamas.
[22:56.880 --> 23:00.920]  But I need people's help more than ever if they want me to fight, and I intend to fight,
[23:00.920 --> 23:06.040]  to clear my name against these politically motivated charges and these politically motivated
[23:06.040 --> 23:07.040]  prosecutors.
[23:07.040 --> 23:10.880]  I need folks to go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[23:10.880 --> 23:17.160]  This is going to be, you know, they project my legal cost to be $2 million, but I intend
[23:17.160 --> 23:18.160]  to fight.
[23:18.160 --> 23:19.960]  I need every patriot to stand with me.
[23:19.960 --> 23:24.360]  And, Roger, I want to be very clear about this.
[23:24.360 --> 23:31.000]  BuzzFeed gets $300 million a year and doesn't have the traffic of InfoWars with our combined
[23:31.000 --> 23:32.000]  network.
[23:32.000 --> 23:37.960]  We sell $40, $50 million a product, but it's literally marked down to half cost, so then
[23:37.960 --> 23:44.360]  that's gross $20 million, well, no, gross 40, then when we keep 20, then you hire all
[23:44.360 --> 23:47.960]  the crew, pay all the services, pay for the bandwidth, do everything, I'm left with a
[23:47.960 --> 23:51.520]  couple million, and then it literally all goes to lawyers.
[23:51.520 --> 23:53.320]  And so InfoWars needs to be supported.
[23:53.320 --> 23:55.960]  Everyone needs to double down and go buy the products.
[23:55.960 --> 24:02.000]  BuzzFeed gets $300 million pure cash and still loses $100 million a year and just laid
[24:02.000 --> 24:03.000]  off 15%.
[24:03.000 --> 24:06.440]  They're cutting us off because we're popular, because we tell the truth, because we were
[24:06.440 --> 24:09.800]  growing and expanding, now we're to the point of contracting.
[24:09.800 --> 24:15.120]  So yes, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, go get products, and yes, Roger, people need
[24:15.120 --> 24:22.200]  to commit now to go get a t-shirt at InfoWarsStore.com, but also to go get a t-shirt at StoneColdTruth.com,
[24:22.200 --> 24:25.800]  to go there and make a donation to your legal defense fund, because when you sell a t-shirt
[24:25.800 --> 24:29.200]  for 20 bucks and only make like $12, $13, that's okay.
[24:29.200 --> 24:33.040]  It's a memento, but straight up donations are what you need, and folks don't know you've
[24:33.040 --> 24:37.720]  already spent over a million on your legal fees, I've spent battling these guys and everything
[24:37.720 --> 24:43.840]  they did, and all together now $3 million the last two years, I mean they are literally
[24:43.840 --> 24:47.520]  destroying us, but the listeners have us in their hands.
[24:47.520 --> 24:51.600]  StoneDefenseFund.com, let's send Mueller and all the rest of them a very strong message
[24:51.600 --> 24:55.280]  that people believe in the press, they believe in America, they want people to stand up to
[24:55.280 --> 24:59.440]  Hillary, they want people to stand up to the globalist, we won fair and square, they're
[24:59.440 --> 25:03.960]  pissed, and they're sending a message that if populist nationalists try to stand up to
[25:03.960 --> 25:07.720]  the globalist, we will destroy you, but Roger, as you said, you're not going to be intimidated,
[25:07.720 --> 25:11.680]  I'm very proud to know you, I'm honored to know you, you're fun to talk to every day,
[25:11.680 --> 25:14.400]  you're a good friend of mine now that I've known you the last, I met you like five years
[25:14.400 --> 25:17.640]  ago, but I've gotten to know you the last three or three and a half, and it's just an
[25:17.640 --> 25:24.160]  amazing thing that we're in together, my friend, and so just talk about again the pre-dawn
[25:24.160 --> 25:29.040]  raid, your wife, what she's going through, they're moving into your house, we'll show
[25:29.040 --> 25:40.240]  the footage, they've got big tarps going up, I mean, this is just incredible, Roger.
[25:40.240 --> 25:44.960]  There's no doubt they're going in and dropping the phone, all these phones are tapped, I
[25:44.960 --> 25:49.200]  mean, tell, they admit there's taps out on them, so you better believe they are so pissed
[25:49.200 --> 25:56.200]  right now that we're able to talk to Roger, they are so upset this is going on, 80% chance
[25:56.200 --> 26:00.880]  they're cutting the feed, 20% chance there's so many reporters and so many digital cell
[26:00.880 --> 26:05.800]  phones and so much stuff out there, now it looks like 1,000 reporters that that can also
[26:05.800 --> 26:09.560]  make things drop, you ever been in a huge traffic jam, and you notice your phone keeps
[26:09.560 --> 26:15.080]  dropping, because there's so many people on their phones, did Roger answer?
[26:15.080 --> 26:19.960]  Keep calling him until you get him, and we'll obviously have Roger as this unfolds throughout
[26:19.960 --> 26:25.120]  the day, but you can hear that his voice is almost gone, he's been up all night long,
[26:25.120 --> 26:29.200]  we have his exclusive statement up on infowars.com, we'll obviously take the audio in the video
[26:29.200 --> 26:34.440]  of this right now, Roger Stone's exclusive interview, first interview after being released
[26:34.440 --> 26:40.320]  from jail, we're going to post this immediately to infowars.com, to the exclusive first statement
[26:40.320 --> 26:46.240]  from Roger Stone after his arrest, Stone Slam's Muller as a rogue prosecutor sent text messages
[26:46.240 --> 26:50.760]  last night, said they're setting me up for the kill, and the last thing he sent me was
[26:50.760 --> 27:00.520]  a meme somebody made of myself, Faith Goldie, and Roger saying the unperson that disappeared,
[27:00.520 --> 27:04.720]  and he said, I think they're going to probably arrest me tomorrow, and I had a long conversation
[27:04.720 --> 27:07.640]  with him yesterday, and I said, how do you know, and he goes, I can just see it, he goes,
[27:07.640 --> 27:11.720]  there's all these puff pieces about how I've been treated bad, and it's kind of mean, and
[27:11.720 --> 27:15.360]  that's the media knowing it's coming, they don't want to look like bad guys for demonizing
[27:15.360 --> 27:20.160]  him, so CNN reporter admits he was waiting outside Roger Stone's house an hour before
[27:20.160 --> 27:26.640]  the arrest, he's still not picking up, well this is just driving me absolutely crazy,
[27:26.640 --> 27:30.640]  well at least we got the world exclusion, but he had a lot more to add and able to reach
[27:30.640 --> 27:34.720]  out to the president and tell the president what he thinks the president obviously needs
[27:34.720 --> 27:43.240]  to do, and I just got IT just called, they said we're being hit with denial of service
[27:43.240 --> 27:47.520]  attacks, they're definitely denial of service attacks, it's not just traffic, so they're
[27:47.520 --> 27:54.400]  attacking the feeds right now in Full Wars Live, again and the cell phone to Grant Smith's
[27:54.400 --> 28:00.840]  lawyer cut out repeatedly, and that's not Roger doing that, hello this is Grant Smith,
[28:00.840 --> 28:06.080]  so that may be again all the bandwidth being sucked up out of there, I'm going to text
[28:06.080 --> 28:18.040]  Grant and tell him to call us feel a landline, I'm going to text Grant right now, okay, okay
[28:18.040 --> 28:23.520]  let's go to Roger Stone, he came outside, here it is, he's going to speak, he speaks
[28:23.520 --> 28:29.560]  for himself, you know that Roger Stone has always spoken for himself, he's never been
[28:29.560 --> 28:37.320]  tried about telling his story, he is innocent, we're going to defend this case and we're
[28:37.320 --> 28:42.480]  going to win this case, but let me start out by saying that the spectacle this morning
[28:42.480 --> 28:49.560]  was completely unnecessary, everyone knows where Roger Stone is, he's not in hiding,
[28:49.560 --> 28:54.440]  the spectacle this morning with a SWAT team breaking into his house, alright we got this

[31:59.880 --> 32:03.920]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[32:03.920 --> 32:09.160]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it
[32:09.160 --> 32:14.240]  literally dumbs the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers
[32:14.240 --> 32:20.600]  the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations, first seaweed based iodine
[32:20.600 --> 32:23.920]  that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a
[32:23.920 --> 32:28.880]  supply of it, so we discovered deep earth crystals, a pure nascent iodine and brought
[32:28.880 --> 32:33.680]  you X2, that's been incredible, now due to the establishment trying to block that, we
[32:33.680 --> 32:39.320]  did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine, but
[32:39.320 --> 32:43.160]  chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three
[32:43.160 --> 32:49.960]  other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more
[32:49.960 --> 32:55.200]  bio available, ladies and gentlemen you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an
[32:55.200 --> 32:59.520]  incredible discovery, X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[33:25.200 --> 33:48.080]  Alright, I warned Roger Stone off air earlier, I said when you go out there, they're going
[33:48.080 --> 33:52.080]  to heckle you and shout you down, he said really, this is during the break and I said
[33:52.080 --> 33:56.200]  yeah, you just stand with us as long as possible, you'll have a clear broadcast to get out what
[33:56.200 --> 34:00.640]  you want, they're going to cherry pick this, now this is near live, we went to break three
[34:00.640 --> 34:05.880]  minutes ago, four minutes ago, we've got it paused on the DVR in there from the CNN
[34:05.880 --> 34:10.800]  feed, we've also got his lawyer coming on later, Roger will be back on later with us
[34:10.800 --> 34:14.720]  once he gets in the car, goes home, takes a shower, you'll get global exclusives here
[34:14.720 --> 34:19.360]  at m4slife.com on the live feeds, the war room you name it, but he went out and here's
[34:19.360 --> 34:24.360]  the left screaming over him, don't let a man that's just been indicted have his voice,
[34:24.360 --> 34:28.800]  shut him down, shut him off the web, shut him off the internet, shut him down off TV,
[34:28.800 --> 34:57.800]  let's go to his live press conference here it is.
[34:58.800 --> 35:19.680]  I think it's cussed out everywhere in Florida, things thrown at him, it's all good, don't
[35:19.680 --> 35:41.640]  let him speak, that's the left, this is beyond a movie, this is a mad mob, no Russia trying
[35:41.640 --> 35:54.400]  to take his speech and put him in prison like you're doing the info wars, oh there's a stand
[35:54.400 --> 36:13.320]  up for him, I don't want Mueller up for Uranium 1, told Roger this is going to happen, told
[36:13.320 --> 36:24.880]  the FBI agents arrived at my home with 17 vehicles with their lights flashing when they could
[36:24.880 --> 36:31.920]  simply have contacted my attorneys and I would have been more than willing to surrender voluntarily.
[36:31.920 --> 36:45.720]  I was taken to the FBI facility, I will plead not guilty to these charges, I will defeat
[36:45.720 --> 36:53.280]  them in court, I believe this is a politically motivated investigation, I am troubled by the
[36:53.280 --> 37:02.160]  political motivations of prosecutors and as I have said previously there is no circumstance
[37:02.160 --> 37:10.080]  whatsoever under which I will bear false witness against the president nor will I make up lies
[37:10.080 --> 37:16.480]  to ease the pressure on myself, I look forward to being fully and completely vindicated.
[37:16.480 --> 37:30.120]  Since I was not contacted prior to the charges today and my lawyers have not talked to the
[37:30.120 --> 37:34.840]  special prosecutors, I don't want to address that question but I have made it clear I will
[37:34.840 --> 37:39.720]  not testify against the president because I would have to bear false witness against
[37:39.720 --> 37:46.720]  the president.
[37:46.720 --> 37:50.120]  I will be appearing for an arraignment in DC next week and I will address those questions
[37:50.120 --> 37:51.120]  at that time.
[37:51.120 --> 37:55.520]  Roger, the president said that you had done what do you think he meant by that?
[37:55.520 --> 38:00.520]  Well, I intend to tell the truth, I have told the truth through this entire proceeding
[38:00.520 --> 38:03.160]  and I will prove that in a court of law.
[38:03.160 --> 38:06.280]  Are you going to ask the president for a part?
[38:06.280 --> 38:12.760]  I am one of his oldest friends, I am a fervent supporter of the president, I think he is
[38:12.760 --> 38:15.720]  doing a great job of admitting to America, great again.
[38:15.720 --> 38:19.720]  Roger, did anyone tell you to contact in the Trump campaign to contact WikiLeaks?
[38:19.720 --> 38:23.040]  No, I have addressed that before, that is incorrect.
[38:23.040 --> 38:29.120]  Roger, if you are convicted, do you think the president held hard in you?
[38:29.120 --> 38:30.120]  Pardon me?
[38:30.120 --> 38:32.920]  If you are convicted, do you think the president would pardon you?
[38:32.920 --> 38:36.920]  The only person I have advocated a pardon for is Marcus Garvey.
[38:36.920 --> 38:44.920]  Some of the NBC news, so the question is, did you in any way work with the Russians to
[38:44.920 --> 38:47.920]  help the president Trump?
[38:47.920 --> 38:49.920]  Categorically not, no.
[38:49.920 --> 38:50.920]  Absolutely not.
[38:50.920 --> 38:59.960]  So see, this is our typo, say it down a little bit, this is emblematic of, hey Roger, you
[38:59.960 --> 39:03.240]  can go out there to those thousands of reporters, they are going to shout you down and you are
[39:03.240 --> 39:07.040]  not going to hear a damn word you say and then it is going to be you deny that you are
[39:07.040 --> 39:08.040]  a Russian.
[39:08.040 --> 39:12.120]  There is no Russia, there is nothing except Mueller and Hillary who are desperate to cover
[39:12.120 --> 39:13.120]  up their Russia ties.
[39:13.120 --> 39:17.120]  I will address those questions next week in Washington D.C.
[39:17.120 --> 39:22.280]  Biggest joke ever, and Roger will be back on the show this hour, next hour, he will
[39:22.280 --> 39:28.200]  be here live, so you will hear Roger Stone, he is going to think I literally am Nostradamus
[39:28.200 --> 39:32.520]  or Karnak when I call him up as soon as I get him on the damn line because I told him
[39:32.520 --> 39:38.240]  I said you march out there, they are going to scream and yell over you and call the reporters
[39:38.240 --> 39:42.200]  themselves, they are a bunch of political activists, go back to that feed and they are
[39:42.200 --> 39:46.480]  going to do all this, you have got to go out and you have got to say this is a war on the
[39:46.480 --> 39:52.160]  press, this is a war on free speech, dirty tricks in politics, goes back to the Nixon
[39:52.160 --> 39:58.000]  years in American politics, Roger Stone denying emphatically the charges, he has no chance
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.720]  to read the indictment, he says he will not testify against the president because doing
[40:01.720 --> 40:04.000]  so Roger Stone's words were required.
[40:04.000 --> 40:07.720]  Let me tell you what dirty tricks are, dirty tricks is teaching five-year-old boys how
[40:07.720 --> 40:12.760]  to put dresses on, dirty tricks is what the mainstream corporate media does, saying that
[40:12.760 --> 40:17.680]  Trump took the bust of Martin Luther King out of the White House, Jim Acosta, that's
[40:17.680 --> 40:21.080]  the dirty tricks here, let's hear some more of the crap coming out of their mouths.
[40:21.080 --> 40:26.240]  He was under investigation but I was talking to Roger Stone's friends in the last couple
[40:26.240 --> 40:29.760]  of days and they said they have watched what happened, that Roger Stone has watched what
[40:29.760 --> 40:32.960]  happened to Paul Manafort and he does not want the same thing to happen.
[40:32.960 --> 40:33.960]  No, that's right, he's not going to keep quiet.
[40:33.960 --> 40:36.480]  He says he wants what happened to Paul Manafort, former Trump campaign chairman.
[40:36.480 --> 40:37.480]  That's not going to hurt you.
[40:37.480 --> 40:42.680]  Yeah, no Russian collusion, income tax stuff from 15 years ago, same thing with the idiot
[40:42.680 --> 40:47.720]  Michael Cohen, let's go to this feed here of Stone, let's hear this live feed of Stone
[40:47.720 --> 40:52.560]  walking down the steps or this is from when he came down earlier, he makes that joke and
[40:52.560 --> 40:55.640]  does that Nixonian thing, I don't think any of that is funny.
[40:55.640 --> 40:57.480]  I mean, I like Roger and everything.
[40:57.480 --> 41:00.920]  He said that the FBI agents the way they came, he said if they just called me, I would have
[41:00.920 --> 41:01.920]  come in.
[41:01.920 --> 41:02.920]  Are there guidelines?
[41:02.920 --> 41:03.920]  Yes.
[41:03.920 --> 41:07.160]  Are there reasons that the FBI, that's what I'm going to get to, that they had some reasons
[41:07.160 --> 41:08.160]  to believe.
[41:08.160 --> 41:09.160]  That's enough from CNN.
[41:09.160 --> 41:12.080]  They did that to make him look like a guilty criminal.
[41:12.080 --> 41:17.600]  I've told you this a thousand times, they'll have like year-long stings I've seen on Amish
[41:17.600 --> 41:25.000]  people who don't even sell milk or cheese but the government wants their property in
[41:25.000 --> 41:31.840]  a famous case in Pennsylvania, another one in Michigan between a federal and state park.
[41:31.840 --> 41:34.960]  They wanted that land to build a road a couple hundred acres.
[41:34.960 --> 41:42.040]  I've had the lawyers for a month years ago, well, several Amish groups and so for like
[41:42.040 --> 41:47.280]  a year, these neighbors move in and they keep begging, please sell us cheese and finally
[41:47.280 --> 41:52.960]  the Amish guy goes, I'll just give you cheese and they go, great, I'm going to give to my
[41:52.960 --> 41:59.760]  cousin in the next state, give it to her you want, sonny, interstate crime, now who got
[41:59.760 --> 42:05.600]  an Amish guy, he didn't wipe his butt properly at age two, that's a real criminal you got
[42:05.600 --> 42:10.000]  there, real El Chapo and then they come in with SWAT teams, guns, shoved their heads
[42:10.000 --> 42:14.720]  down and everything but see the average jury thinks, well they must be bad if they did
[42:14.720 --> 42:19.560]  this instead, no, this is bad, this is bad.
[42:19.560 --> 42:23.240]  Now here's my plug because I barely plugged and I'm not trying to write myself into the
[42:23.240 --> 42:25.360]  story, believe me, I wish this would stop.
[42:25.360 --> 42:30.720]  Here's the Washington Post, here it all is, we're under investigation for fake hush money
[42:30.720 --> 42:36.360]  to the Corsi who we've been working with for 16 years saying paying him is hush money and
[42:36.360 --> 42:39.640]  I've got reporters calling up saying are you the next to be indicted and Mueller has the
[42:39.640 --> 42:43.520]  grand jury talking about this, so you're like let him make sense, that's crazy, that's how
[42:43.520 --> 42:48.080]  witch hunts work, so I need money to fight this period, they've been trying to curtail

[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:34.400]  They were literally thrown out of the courthouse.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:42.400]  The first time the phone cut out, the next time they grabbed the phone away and hung it up and threw them out because they were so scared of the thousands showing up.
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:50.400]  So that's them again. Hello? Hey, let me do this. I'll call you right back.
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:54.400]  Anyways, Roger Stone's coming right back on probably in 15, 20 minutes.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:01:01.400]  I've got his lawyer also ready to come on. And again, if I'm a little hyped up here with the crew, I'm just ready to win here.
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:09.400]  I'm ready to expose this and when I'm on, I'm on. I said, Roger, you're going to go out there and they're going to drown you out and they're going to, they're going to, they're going to, they're going to.
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:14.400]  And I said, all you can say is, oh, now you're against free press. You won't let me have my speech.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:18.400]  I pulled him and it happened. I know the enemy.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:22.400]  So we're going to be looking at all the angles of that today.
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:25.400]  And we do have his exclusive where he got to speak.
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:31.400]  Imagine someone charged with this anti free speech, anti journalism, garbage, no rush of collusion.
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:42.400]  He actually got to speak. So coming up the start of the next segment, I am going to play what Roger said last hour so that everybody gets to see it and hear it again.
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:48.400]  And then we were going to take the interview as soon as we can and post it to info wars.com is being uploaded right now.
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:56.400]  But you know, there's your headlines, ladies and gentlemen, Roger Stone completely shut down, not allowed to have any free speech.
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:02.400]  Roger Stone drowned out by lock him up chance while giving press conference.
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:05.400]  I told him it was going to happen. This was his chance to respond.
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:12.400]  And now he needs to come on air and talk about how this has happened and how he's had his speech taken because that's what this whole thing is.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.400]  These people can't beat us politically.
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:18.400]  So they want to silence us, then frame us and put us in jail.
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:21.400]  Silence us, frame us, put us in jail.
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:24.400]  Silence us, frame us, put us in jail.
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.400]  Silence us, frame us, put us in jail.
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.400]  Silence us, frame us, put us in jail.
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:37.400]  And he tries to go out and give a press conference and the press itself, they were involved because they're not the press.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:48.400]  They're a bunch of Jim Acosta's. They shout him down his big opportunity in front of every damn news entity going out globally because that was hundreds of millions of dollars of publicity.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:51.400]  That was him getting to say he could do something.
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:55.400]  Roger Stone's back on?
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.400]  Live?
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:02.400]  Okay, let's bring Roger back up. Roger, did I not predict they drowned you out, my friend?
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.400]  Well, they tried.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:08.400]  You did a great job. I'm not criticizing you, but world exclusive now this time.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:14.400]  What was it? I mean, a lot of it got out. You look great. You sounded great, but brother, they don't want you to have your speech.
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.400]  So this is your chance. Go ahead.
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:24.400]  Yeah, no, the best thing about it, Alex, was that they were furious, furious that we were talking on InfoWars and made them cool their heels.
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:35.400]  CNN, MSNBC, Fox, all bombarding my lawyers with text messages and phone calls, going crazy because we were live and exclusive on InfoWars.
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:38.400]  So I'm very grateful for that.
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:51.400]  Yeah, just to recap, at literally the rise of the sun this morning, I had gotten up from bed to the pounding on the door.
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:59.400]  I looked out on the street and there were 17 vehicles, all with their lights on.
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:10.400]  I went to the front door, which has glass in it. There were two FBI agents pointing semi-automatic weapons at me, shouting at the top of their lungs,
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:14.400]  open the door, open the door. I opened the door and they said, are you Roger Stone?
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.400]  They said yes. They said you're under arrest.
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:25.400]  They stepped out of the house. I stepped out of the door. They put handcuffs on me and they took me out in the front yard.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:31.400]  They asked me if there were any weapons in the house. There are not.
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:39.400]  They asked me about my dogs. I said they're harmless. They asked me who else was in the house. I said my wife. They said who else?
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:44.400]  I said my wife. I said, but there's someone else. I said there is no one else and there wasn't.
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:54.400]  Hold on. Stay right there. Don't hang up. World exclusive, Roger Stone, not allowed with a thousand plus media to have his speech drowned out by members of the press.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:05:22.400]  They'll have his speech straight ahead. Stay with us.
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:31.400]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water and enjoy.
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:39.400]  With 14 servings per box for a two week or more supply, this is the formula to stock up on whenever you need a boost.
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:42.400]  Perfect for work, in the car, or at home.
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:47.400]  Turbo Force is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day. Don't let your day slow you down.
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:57.400]  Perk Up with Turbo Force at InfowarStore.com
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:22.400]  Alan Dershowitz says Trump is the target. Yeah.
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:30.400]  Mueller, Comey, Rosenstein all lied to Congress and said Trump was the target. They lied. He was the target. They did wear wires.
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.400]  Trump's a patriot. They're the ones in the Russian payroll.
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:36.400]  Roger Stone was on with this for 25 minutes at the start of the show.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:41.400]  He told me earlier they came in, grabbed the phone away at the courthouse, said there's thousands out there. It's too dangerous.
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:47.400]  They're too angry. Get out there. Repeat all that. So Roger Stone goes out. He did a great job, but they drowned him out mainly.
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:52.400]  They had to end the press conference. Media just shouting questions incoherently. You all saw the footage.
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:57.400]  So now Roger Stone, thanks to Infowar, still existing. We're supposed to already be gone.
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:02.400]  I can't tell you the stuff they've done behind the scenes and publicly, but they have fought like the devil to try to take us down.
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:08.400]  But thanks to you listeners and thanks to your prayers and your support, we are still here.
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:12.400]  And Roger is still here when he'll tell you the only place to support him was Infowars.
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:17.400]  Even though it put an albatross around my neck, hey, I already put that thing on before I ever met Roger.
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:28.400]  So Roger, you've got the floor right now to lay out exactly what happened and then have your statement and then what happened with that howling crowd of so-called press trying to silence you.
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:43.400]  All right. Well, so to pick up the narrative, they then, the FBI told me they had a warrant to search my home, to seize all my computers, my cell phone, my iPad, so on.
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:55.400]  They also had warrants to seize the Infowar studio, which is an open park, and to inspect my apartment in New York.
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:08:05.400]  They showed up at both those locations. They did ask for the key for the Infowar studio so they didn't have to break the door down, which I gave them.
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:11.400]  There's nothing there to find. The irony of this, of course, is that they're searching for records they already have.
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:19.400]  Since we know they have been monitoring my email, text messages, and phone calls for over two years, two and a half years.
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:26.400]  Then they took me, still handcuffed, to the FBI processing center.
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:36.400]  The individual FBI agents were very courteous, very respectful, got me some water, got me a protein bar, but let me use the bathroom.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:49.400]  Then I was fingerprinted. They took mug shots, and then they transferred me from there to the federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale, about a 40-minute drive.
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:56.400]  There we went into the garage because the media mouse problem was beginning.
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:09:08.400]  There were probably 300 reporters there when I arrived. That crowd just grew. There were also a throng of supporters and a throng of protesters.
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:13.400]  Then I was put into a holding cell.
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:32.400]  I was then shackled, hand in foot, heavy metal shackles, and was taken to a holding cell with a group of other gentlemen, all of whom are African-American and all of whom are there for some drug-related charges.
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:45.400]  Every one of them, by the way, supported the president's new policy regarding sentencing guidelines. Then after waiting there for a while, they let me see my attorneys.
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:56.400]  My attorneys told me that the government had agreed to bond of $250,000, but then that I would be brought before a judge.
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:11.400]  I went before the judge, still shackled, room full of press, but no cameras. It was very brief. The government and my lawyers both agreed to allow me a bond.
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:25.400]  Right now my travel restrictions are Washington, D.C., New York City, and South Florida. If I want to come to Austin, which I do, I have to get permission, but my attorneys think that is doable.
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:36.400]  So I am restricted in where I can go. I am ordered to take more substance abuse testing, which they tell me is standard. That's about it.
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:42.400]  At this moment, there is no press gag on me, but I will be brought before a magistrate.
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:56.400]  The thing here is, why are they treating me like the OG? They are treating me like Pablo Escobar when all they had to do was ask my attorney, and I would have volunteered voluntarily.
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:03.400]  I would have come properly dressed. Instead, I didn't shave. I didn't even get a chance to put a brush or brush my teeth.
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:18.400]  You look great in the T-shirt. Let's stop right there because they don't want you to be able to speak. I know what you were planning to say at the press conference after you talked about your innocence and the war on the press and how this is a war on the president, which you've accurately predicted.
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:33.400]  So let's move on to what comes next now because they don't want you to have speech. They even had the press shouting you down, not just hecklers, over a thousand people, more showing up. So for people that don't know what's happening, tell them what's coming next.
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:40.400]  You've been very, very accurate and the war on the press, the things we talked about off air that you were going to say at the press conference that they stopped you from saying.
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:55.400]  Well, what was most disconcerting about the press scrum is that some of the people were, of course, just loud-bought left-wing demonstrators, but some of the alternative left-wing media type were shouting out,
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:12:04.400]  did you collude with the Russians? Are you a Russian? Do you work with the Russians? I mean, it was really ridiculous because anyone who's read this indictment knows that's not the case.
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:15.400]  And anyone that knows when, I mean, this is a world exclusive bigger than OJ, literally, three or four times the number. This is the biggest press conference hysteria I've ever seen, literally.
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:23.400]  And they won't shut up screaming, are you a Russian? Are you a Russian? Are you a Russian? Where you can't even give a damn statement like everybody does and then takes questions.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:29.400]  They ran you off rather than get questions in. This only went like six minutes. This was insane.
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:39.400]  Well, that's because I wanted, in all honesty, to tell the full story here at InfoWars and it was just untenable. It wouldn't shut up long enough for me to take questions.
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:47.400]  I was barely able to make a statement and here's what I said. After two years of intense scrutiny, this is what the government comes up with.
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:59.400]  No Russian collusion, no Wikileaks collaboration, no illegal act regarding the 2015 election, all process crimes, fabricated, manufactured process crimes.
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:05.400]  I'm accused of being less than truthful in my testimony for the House Intelligence Committee. That's just false.
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:17.400]  To the extent that I've made errors, they're inconsequential. They're not material to anything. They don't hide anything. It would be honest errors of memory.
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:26.400]  And in one case, they're absolutely right. I did forget text messages that were entirely exculpatory and prove that everything I had told them was true.
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:37.400]  So, you know, Adam Schiff and Eric Swallow as well and their allies put ungodly pressure on Robert Mueller to bring this indictment and they did.
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:50.400]  These are crumped up phony charges. I haven't intimidated any witnesses. I haven't obstructed justice. I did not work with the Russians and this has nothing to do with Donald Trump other than the fact that you asked me what the next step is.
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:14:01.400]  The next step I think is pretty clear. This is where they promised to go light on Mayfong, just helped them nail Donald Trump. That's the next step and that's not going to happen.
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:08.400]  Well, I hate to raise this, but they're encamped at your house, digging over everything, hoping to find a crooked toenail or something, nothing related to Russia.
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:25.400]  I said last night, I said, I hope they don't put you under the jail like, like, you know, Manafort. So, so, you know, looking into the eyes of history, looking into real destiny here, Roger, what do you expect them to do next week when you're arraigned in D.C.?
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:38.400]  Well, I'll have a statement then, because I believe when you are falsely accused, it's vitally important that you respond. And I know info wars will be there to cover it. So I know that people will hear what I actually have to say.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:47.400]  You know, I'll be available for the war room today, although we have our veteran show. So people can get blow by blow of what happened.
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:59.400]  Yeah, we have Friday veterans call in. I think they'll understand it's preemptive today. Yes, we're going to print that Roger. I can tell people are talking to you and telling you to go, but this is a world exclusive.
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:06.400]  They've tried to silence you. I want you to just hold on for five more minutes on the side and then pop it on the warm today. I know you're very exhausted.
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:20.400]  You know, but up since five a.m. when they swat team rated you. But but just now and going to break. What does the president need to do? And this is beyond McCarthyism. Now, none of this is Russia gate. It's run by a guy who gives uranium to Russians on tarmac.
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:28.400]  His name ought to be Vlad Muller. I mean, what the hell's going on here?
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:30.400]  And they grabbed the phone away again.
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:39.400]  No, I'm here. Oh, you're there. Okay. There's so much to call waiting, Roger. Don't hang up. You got to go to break. I moved to a different room so I could get more quiet. No, it's okay. Go ahead.
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:47.400]  We're going to go to break, my friend. I'll talk to you during the break. Don't hang up. Come back. One more one more segment, global exclusive. Think of all the things we talk about off air. You're so interesting off air on air, too.
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:16:03.400]  All the things you want to say because they don't, especially next week you go in, they might throw into the jail. So what does Roger want the world to know really happens? Stay with us.
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:42.400]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of Empire shows that World Wars one and two left England broken.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:57.400]  Its former colony, the US had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War One, the United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.

[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:18.400]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:30.400]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH. What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:41.400]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure Gravity Filter, and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:52.400]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:20:01.400]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:23.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:38.400]  Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:47.400]  All over the world now, nationalists and patriots are getting elected. And everywhere they're being elected, they turn the tide of tyranny.
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:59.400]  But then the deep state tries to indict them. Roger Stone was the chief advisor to Trump. He got him to run exploratory in 2000, again in 2014 or so for 2016.
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:03.400]  He's been targeted for two and a half years with this BS.
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:13.400]  So have I. We've laughed about it a lot until it got down to the wire that trying to talk to WikiLeaks is criminal and Russian collusion when they're not even Russian.
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:18.400]  And all the rest of the media could talk to him, including the Washington Post, the New York Times, CNN.
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:24.400]  And now CNN's camped outside his house, gets the tip. They're there, 29 SWAT team raid.
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:30.400]  And then Roger gets out, goes and gives a press conference after he talks to us exclusively.
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:35.400]  And there's so many reporters screaming, you're a Russian, you're a Russian, you can't hear anything.
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:44.400]  Obviously, they all got there to shout him down so that he wouldn't get a statement. Well, you're going to get his statement here right now. What he thinks the president should do, where this country's going.
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:50.400]  Dershowitz is now saying the sky's blue and wanting the president that he is the target. This is made up.
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:57.400]  A point, a special prosecutor. You've got the president's year right now more than ever, Roger. You're 44 years of friendship.
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:03.400]  The White House is watching right now, Roger. Specifically, what's happening, Big Picture? What does the president need to do?
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:10.400]  What does America need to do to understand the real threat we face as the deep states taking down the First Amendment and everything right now?
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:20.400]  Well, I think they demonstrated today that they treat the president's advisors, the treat the president's friends like gangsters.
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:28.400]  I did not expect to wake up and be looking down the barrel with two guns this morning at 5.55 this morning.
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:39.400]  They are clearly desperate to take down Donald Trump. I expect that they will try to put my head in a vice to get me to bear false witness against him.
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:50.400]  I'm not going to do that, as I've made very clear. He needs to appoint a special counsel to examine the vice-awards. He needs to declassify them immediately.
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:23:01.400]  That, I think, brings the whole globalist Obama-Clinton house on cards down. It is the single most important thing that he can do,
[01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:11.400]  and then it will give a special counsel of his appointment, of the new attorney general's appointment, or even the acting attorney general's appointment, a roadmap.
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:24.400]  And that roadmap needs to be followed. There's no doubt in my mind that this isn't about Roger Schoen, other than the fact that this indictment is so thin, so incorrect, has so many distortions in it.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:35.400]  My lawyers are aghast. First of all, they were aghast that they weren't called. CNN knew of my arrest before they did, which is unheard of. Unheard of.
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:46.400]  They had to put out a press release prior to my lawyers being notified so they could have a media circus, and then treating me like the OG. I'm not the OG.
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:56.400]  But if they're going to treat me like one, I might as well act like one. I mean, it's absurd. This is, you know, the first they tried to break you financially,
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:05.400]  so hoping that I would plead guilty to these charges. I lost my life in health insurance in December. I had to sell my car.
[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:16.400]  I had to liquidate a small fund I had put aside for my book sales for the college education of my children. I have no stocks, no bonds, no real estate.
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:31.400]  You know, thank God for InfoWars because you guys have kept me alive. I have a couple other very small gigs, but not much. Facebook and their war of censorship against InfoWars and against me has really hurt my book sales.
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:46.400]  So the idea is to put you under such intense financial pressure, you're forced to plead guilty to something you didn't do and then in turn to turn on President Michael Cohen's style.
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:53.400]  And let's be clear. Let's be clear. Let's be clear. You make that statement, but they're making their move now. They're going to move on the president.
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:25:03.400]  Dershowitz is smart. He's admitted it. But let's just talk about this. They need us to be the demons. They need somebody to say, OK, we're Russians when there's no proof.
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:15.400]  And again, nothing here. So that's why if people support InfoWarsStore.com, if they support, because I support you, if they support StoneDefenseFund.com, this is the revolution.
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:27.400]  This is 1776 part two. This is standing against the whole system. So yes, everyone should send a strong message at StoneDefenseFund.com and go make donations there right now.
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:37.400]  And everyone should go to InfoWarsStore.com and get your books and get your t-shirt because part of that proceeds goes to you because as you know, Roger, we're next in the hopper.
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:46.400]  We told everybody they were going to try to frame my dad for hush money because Corsi signed a contract where he'd get paid out unless it was for cause.
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:53.400]  So it'd be nice. We paid out the last six months of his contract that just so happens to end in January. That's when it was signed two years ago.
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:58.400]  So it's renewed every year. And I've got my phone ringing off the hook like, are you going to jail next for your hush money?
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:14.400]  So now paying your reporters is hush money. I mean, these people are going for a broke, but put them on the defense. They're in uranium one, hundreds of millions from the Russians, Mueller at tarmacs, uranium, the foundations, the kidnapped kids and Haiti.
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:24.400]  I mean, it's just, Trump doesn't ever go on the offense. And it's insane as they creep up towards him, your emergency message to the president. Again, what are you saying to the president right now?
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:31.400]  A point of special counsel immediately to investigate uranium one and the crimes of the Clintons and the Obamas.
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:41.400]  Secondarily declassify all of the documents. Who else was subject to an illegal unconstitutional FISA warrant besides Carter Page?
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:44.400]  Because I believe that I was subject to one.
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:58.400]  Get to the bottom of who has been surveilled. Alex, there's no doubt that they've come for me. And I really believe they are coming for you based on just trumped up nonsense coming from Jerry Corsey.
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:07.400]  Well, let's be clear. Michael Caputo and others a year and a half ago, a year ago, got asked about Alex Jones. We never made that up. You think I want to be in the crosshairs of this?
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:18.400]  He just shows how asinine it is. Now I'm the Russian agent. And if they find something to indict me for made up, it won't be Russia again, because everyone knows I bleed red, white and blue.
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:36.400]  It's an absurdity. Look, I'm a guy who had family members mowed down by a Russian tank in Budapest in 1956. I hate the Russians in their system. I'm a patriotic American. So accusing me of collusion with the Russians is about the greatest single insult you could have.
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:47.400]  You're married to the daughter of a famous Cuban capitalist and fighter, and you help round up a bunch of Russians in the 80s for Reagan. I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:58.400]  Exactly. Which is why I intend to fight. I will fight these charges. This is what they would let me say today. I am innocent. These charges are bogus. They are fabricated.
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:13.400]  None of them relate to Russian collusion. None of them relate to any collaboration with the WikiLeaks. The idea that you or I, for anyone we know, got documents from WikiLeaks and gave them to the Trump campaign is categorically false.
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:24.400]  This is a political indictment as part of a political witch hunt. And I will not bend. I will not falter. I will not fold. And I'm not going to testify against Trump.
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:35.400]  Roger, I know you've got five lawyers and literally 50 chase cars chasing you wherever you went to. We need you on the war room today. The whole world wants to distort what you said.
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:44.400]  They tried to boo you. They tried to block you from having speech. You have it here for now. Thanks to listeners supporting us and building this platform to fight now in America's darkest hour.
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:50.400]  So promise me that you'll pop in at the start of the war room, three o'clock, central, four o'clock Eastern today, okay?
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:57.400]  Probably five o'clock, my normal clock. Okay, perfect. Let me talk to you during the break, though. Stay there.
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:02.400]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem? Learn how to get sober after we share these stories.
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:14.400]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control. After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:20.400]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:29.400]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth. I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't. It hit me when I was arrested.
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:44.400]  It's over now. Your private insurance may cover costs and we'll get you here. It's simple. Just call Elite Rehab Placement right now, please. Don't wait. Your life matters to us.

[01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:21.400]  It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:33.400]  It is a classic O 360 win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:43.400]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:50.400]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:53.400]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[01:32:53.400 --> 01:33:22.400]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShieldInForesLive.com.
[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:32.400]  President Trump, the Alex Jones show, because there is a war on your mind.
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:41.400]  Well, the corporate media is everywhere announcing that they're going to have the first exclusive with Roger Stone, because info wars, we don't exist.
[01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:50.400]  Except with our millions of listeners that are going to get the word out and share these videos, because this is now the making the move and the president, this is it.
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:56.400]  The president came out, he's already compromised once on DACA, which he did a year ago and they said no to.
[01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:09.400]  And now he's saying even more compromise than they're refusing, but they're claiming they've come through a short interim, temporary, government shutdown restart.
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:10.400]  That's coming up.
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:15.400]  We've got one of his lawyers, Tyler Nixon, very smart guy popping in here in a moment.
[01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:29.400]  Some of the reporters that were there today covering this, but Roger, they fought hard at your press conference to block you out and scream your Russian agent, including a lot of the press, the so-called media, who are now murderers of the truth.
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:33.400]  So this is your chance to encapsulate all like three, four minutes.
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:42.400]  And I'm going to run this every day for the next two weeks so people know the truth, because next week, like Paul Manafort, you could disappear into a spider hole, which I hope doesn't happen because I'm next.
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:43.400]  We're all in this together, brother.
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:47.400]  So here's your chance to, to the president, the world, everybody.
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:59.400]  Well, Info Wars is still standing, bleeding, but in the fight, thanks to the prayers of our supporters, here's your chance to communicate your statement about the war on the press, the war on your family.
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:01.400]  There's no Russian collusion in this.
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:02.400]  It's so insane.
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:05.400]  You're trying to put you in prison for decades for being a journalist.
[01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:06.400]  The indictment is insane.
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:08.400]  What does it all signify?
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:09.400]  Roger Stone.
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:13.400]  Well, Alex, America is under attack.
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:15.400]  Info Wars is under attack.
[01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:17.400]  I am under personal attack.
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:29.400]  In order to weaken me, they spread lies about the settlement of a lawsuit weeks ago, pushing the headline, Roger Stone admits pushing lies on Info Wars, which is not what I said.
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:31.400]  In fact, I'll be very clear.
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:37.400]  I've never reported anything at Info Wars or any other platform that I didn't believe to be true at the time I reported it.
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:43.400]  That was an effort to shape my credibility with the public as a setup for what happened today.
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:45.400]  They want to treat me like a gangster.
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:47.400]  They think I'm the OG.
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:54.400]  When they could have just called my employers and I would have voluntarily surrendered and wearing a suit and tie.
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:36:01.400]  Instead, they kick in the door of my house at 5 o'clock in the morning, 5.50, guns drawn.
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:06.400]  They handcuffed me like a drug dealer.
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:20.400]  They pump up completely fabricated non-Russian collusion, no Wikileaks collaboration, no evidence of any crime that pertains to the election of Donald Trump in the 2015 election.
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:31.400]  Allegations pushed by Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell that I was less than truthful in my House Intelligence Committee testimony, which I will not.
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:37.400]  To the extent that I made any error, it would be honest errors of memory, and it would be irrelevant.
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:42.400]  I mean, inconsequential, immaterial as a law was required for a perjury charge.
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:56.400]  What they did to me today was an effort to intimidate me, to humiliate me, putting me in shackles in the federal courthouse, parading me in front of a courtroom full of reporters.
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:02.400]  But I won't bend. I won't break. I won't fade. I won't quit.
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:08.400]  I'm not going to testify against Donald Trump and make up lies that they suggest to ease the pressure on myself.
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:15.400]  I will fight these charges. I have excellent lawyers. I have my deep belief in God.
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:20.400]  I have the strong support of not only my family, but the InfoWars family.
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:28.400]  I do need people to go to StoneDefenseFund.com. My lawyers projected my defense could cost as much as $2 million.
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:36.400]  Right now, I'm struggling to pay the rent, to pay my taxes. I had to sell my car. I lost my health and life insurance.
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:44.400]  You know, it is part of their plan to squeeze you financially to make you plead guilty to something you didn't do,
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:49.400]  and to try to leverage you to testify against our great president. I'm just not going to do that.
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:54.400]  It's called siege. So America is fighting for its life, and all these so-called fake journalists, cheerleading,
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:57.400]  shutting down your speech at the press conference, they should be ashamed of themselves.
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:00.400]  They're not journalists. They're killers of the truth now. That's their new job.
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:07.400]  And America is following a real tyranny. If the president doesn't take action, appoint the special counsel in uranium wine and so much more.
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:14.400]  StoneDefenseFund.com, StoneColdTruth.com, everybody buy a t-shirt, buy a stone rock, whatever.
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:19.400]  I know what this war is like. It takes money to fight this, and I've been particularly targeted for backing Stone, but it's always the real deal.
[01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:23.400]  But I'm honored to be here with you and other Americans to make this country great again.
[01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:29.400]  And Roger, I really, really appreciate you, and obviously you'll be on the war room today with another global exclusive in the second hour.
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:35.400]  It's got a really anger in the mainstream corporate media that they tried to shut you down and boo you out at that press conference.
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:45.400]  But I was told earlier, 50,000 people a second. So when that zeitgeist gets hit, we're hitting the live feeds and crashed our servers, but we're back up.
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:53.400]  It's only 5,000 new people a second hitting right now. So you've got millions of new listeners wanting to hear, well, this is evil devil, this horrible Russian.
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:56.400]  Let's hear what he's done. And there's nothing there, Roger.
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:59.400]  God bless you, Alex, and God bless everyone at InfoWars.
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:04.400]  All right, we'll talk to you soon. Thank you, Roger.
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:10.400]  So again, we've had Roger on today for basically an hour live.
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:15.400]  He had a six minute press conference that they bullied and shut down in front of everyone.
[01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:20.400]  And I talked to him. I said, go back. Was it reporters? He goes, yeah, they were all shouting, you're a Russian or you're a Russian.
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:24.400]  There's no Russian stuff in the indictment. It's all crap.
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:34.400]  So imagine in America, you've got, and I'm not just saying this, Tiger Woods, OJ Simpson, Bill Clinton press conferences.
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:42.400]  I've never seen. The police say there were 2,000 people there by the end. There were over a thousand reporters.
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:48.400]  We were getting 50,000 unique IP addresses a second.
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:57.400]  And we've got some of the biggest server companies in the world. Our regular bandwidth bills are $500,000 a month.
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:01.400]  Today's going to be $500,000.
[01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:08.400]  I mean, this is insane. We have tens of millions tuned in just on the streams, not on radio stations right now.
[01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:10.400]  Normally it's not even a million tuned in at one time.
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:16.400]  So this is all going on. This is insane. And imagine the imagery. He comes out and they won't let him talk.
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:21.400]  Well, you just heard him speak and none of them are picking up what he said because that's the thing.
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:24.400]  They don't want you to actually hear what happened.
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:28.400]  Tyler Nixon is a great guy, one of the chief lawyers for Stone.
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:32.400]  I asked him this morning when I first got a first statement from his lawyer there at the jail.
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:39.400]  His first thing was how's my wife. Okay, she's okay. Here's my directives and information from my lawyers and get Tyler Nixon on.
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:42.400]  And Alex Jones, let him know, you know, this information.
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:48.400]  So we put a statement out that's on M4s.com. That was the first statement. I had ABC, CBS, NBC, Washington Post calling.
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:53.400]  Is that really Roger? I mean, how do we even know you? Oh, he only works here.
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:57.400]  That's how they operate. Like everything we do is fake when they're the fake ones.
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:41:01.400]  And I'm battling for M4s very life. So Tyler Nixon joins us.
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:03.400]  One of Rogers, he's actually a spokesperson. He wanted on.
[01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:09.400]  We're going to break it. I meant to come back to this, but just the indictment of Roger, no Russiagate, a press conference.
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:13.400]  The press shuts it down booing. This is beyond the Soviet Union.
[01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:18.400]  In the Soviet Union, they would listen to what somebody said. I mean, this is insane.
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:26.400]  Yeah, Alex, this is a dark day in America as far as I'm concerned for any patriot or anyone who believes in a constitutional republic and believes in the rule of law,
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:29.400]  believes in liberty and justice above all.
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:36.400]  You know, this is this type of the tactics deployed on Roger Stone, who would be just the first, I'm sure,
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:45.400]  if these people have their way, would make LaVrenti, Beria and Stalin and Himmler and the rest of them, you know, embarrassed or, you know, proud.
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:54.400]  Let's just say proud as far as, you know, they'd be envious. I mean, this is this is the envious. Yeah, they would absolutely love to have this type of power.
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:58.400]  It's a disgrace. It's a disgusting appalling abuse.
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:08.400]  It's been turned into it's been systematized and based on literally Roger Stone's voluntary cooperation with the House Intelligence Committee,
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:15.400]  which clearly is run by partisan mercenaries. This was not a legitimate inquisition or legitimate inquire.
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:17.400]  Excuse me. It was an inquisition.
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:29.400]  And at most what they've done is cooked up misstatements and, you know, insufficient information and turned it into crimes, still no Russian collusion.
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:36.400]  The only Russians, if you want to talk about Russian collusion, we have the Soviets running our Department of Justice as far as I'm concerned.
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:43.400]  I can't tell you how many federal marshals, FBI people, other retired current are just like, we're so ashamed right now.
[01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:47.400]  We can't believe this. I mean, Roger has no criminal record. He said he turned himself out.
[01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:53.400]  They swat to even point guns at his head, threaten his family. It's just my God.

[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:23.400]  Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:47.400]  Well, I've got mainstream national news host calling up saying where it is Mueller's coming after you next.
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:49.400]  Want to comment?
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:54.400]  Yeah, I didn't cover up Jerry Epstein and his little kidnapped kids on planes.
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:57.400]  I'm afraid of God, not Robert Mueller.
[01:47:57.400 --> 01:48:02.400]  And so, I don't look forward to getting hung up by my toes and tortured to death, but you know what?
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:04.400]  That's a limited time.
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:07.400]  I don't want the full, I don't want the full Monty in hell with you guys.
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:11.400]  So, Mueller and all you guys, Hillary, you can choose Hades.
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:12.400]  I want to go with Jesus Christ.
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:13.400]  That's where I stand now.
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:16.400]  I want to be very clear with listeners and viewers here.
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:20.400]  This is the most epic thing we've ever been involved in because it's bigger than Roger Stone.
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:21.400]  It's bigger than President Trump.
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:23.400]  It's bigger than all of us.
[01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:28.400]  It's about the lies by Hillary and the globalists to overturn an election,
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:31.400]  to remove the president and the vice president,
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:39.400]  and to tell us that being Americana and pro free market and capitalist is Russian with no proof.
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:43.400]  And two and a half years into this, almost two years into Mueller,
[01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:47.400]  nothing but them perjuring themselves to Congress, nothing but them wearing wires,
[01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:53.400]  nothing but them lying about investigations, nothing but them caught red handed.
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:49:00.400]  But almost all of DC sits back pissing itself while they send in Mueller's people trying to set us up over and over again.
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:03.400]  And I haven't released the big setup stuff yet.
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:12.400]  And I, I mean, I'm getting close to that, but it doesn't even really matter anymore
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:17.400]  because there are people that are either for the country or against it.
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:23.400]  If you don't know that every Democrat group says America sucks and needs to go away
[01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:28.400]  and it was never great and will never be great and they have chance that we're not cherry picking.
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:32.400]  You think I go to some women's march in Austin funded by Soros or LA or DC.
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:34.400]  I've been to all of them where I see my reporters footage.
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:39.400]  You think I feel good when I go, oh great, the main march was America's going down.
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:42.400]  They go, oh good, I could expose the leftist.
[01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:50.400]  No, I literally walk in to my bedroom and sometimes just lean up against the wall
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:54.400]  because I've got strength and sometimes I start to falter when I think about my kids
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:56.400]  and the people are this evil.
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:57.400]  And I start to cry.
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:58.400]  I'm not going to lie to people.
[01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:04.400]  And it's not that I'm crying out weakness, it's that I just can't believe it.
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:11.400]  We have people openly saying they hate America funded by chai comms that have killed five times what Hitler did.
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:15.400]  And then all we're trying to do is stabilize the country and defend our people
[01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:21.400]  and then we're attacked by a bunch of scum that's involved with the Russians and the Chinese and everybody else.
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:24.400]  It doesn't scare me for myself.
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:25.400]  I'm not scared of Mueller.
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:29.400]  I'm scared that I'm not strong enough and I didn't do a good enough job
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:34.400]  to make sure that a goddamn pedophile army of devil worshipers, and I don't mean that in the Lord's name of Bane,
[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:37.400]  I mean they're damned to hell, didn't get control of our country.
[01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:41.400]  And that more people don't realize how serious this is and how they're planning false slags
[01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:47.400]  and how they're doing all this and how they're trying to destroy the very essence of a nation existing.
[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:51.400]  I was there when we were trying to get ahold of Wickey Lee so they wouldn't talk to us.
[01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:53.400]  I was there, I saw it all.
[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:59.400]  I was there when I hired reporters to set up bureaus like we do and have that turned into hush money
[01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:01.400]  by a bunch of damn criminals.
[01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:08.400]  So going back to Mr. Nixon, Tyler Nixon, one of the spokesperson lawyer for Roger Stone,
[01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:11.400]  you know, he's told me a lot to say once he got indicted or he got grabbed or disappeared,
[01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:13.400]  he could disappear next week into this rat hole.
[01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:18.400]  But I just don't think we can count the cost enough here how real this is.
[01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:19.400]  This is a 21st century threat.
[01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:25.400]  You couldn't take down America if you were the Nazis or the Chai Khoms or the Soviet Russians,
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:27.400]  but you could take it down spiritually and culturally.
[01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:29.400]  And they thought it was their time.
[01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:30.400]  They thought Hillary was coming in.
[01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:31.400]  They thought this would be their event.
[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:34.400]  Trump got in as kind of a speed bump or a wall.
[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:36.400]  They're trying to overrun that right now.
[01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:39.400]  And we can bitch about the president being surrounded by cowards all day,
[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:41.400]  but what do you think Roger needs to do?
[01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:42.400]  What does the audience need to do?
[01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:44.400]  What does the president need to do right now?
[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:47.400]  Because clearly this is an attempt to take the country down.
[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:49.400]  The jurisprudence is under attack.
[01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:51.400]  The right of the press is under attack.
[01:51:51.400 --> 01:51:55.400]  Everything is fundamentally being overthrown right now.
[01:51:55.400 --> 01:51:56.400]  Brother, I feel your pain.
[01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:58.400]  And you know, Alex, you got big shoulders.
[01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:03.400]  You've been fighting this fight for decades, as I have been eyeing my own way.
[01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:04.400]  And let me tell you something.
[01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:07.400]  I went to Mr. Jefferson's University, the University of Virginia Law School.
[01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:09.400]  That's also where Robert Mueller went.
[01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:11.400]  Also where Robert Kennedy went.
[01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:16.400]  If Jefferson were alive today, he would be standing next to Roger Stone,
[01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:18.400]  not next to Robert Mueller.
[01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:21.400]  These people, the evil in them never rests.
[01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:27.400]  They are persistent, ruthless, vicious, mercenaries, partisan hacks
[01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:30.400]  who have taken control of our government, the abuse of power.
[01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:34.400]  I have not seen such a railroading for political activity in my life,
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:36.400]  as they have done to Roger Stone.
[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:38.400]  And this endangers everyone.
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:40.400]  And they're doing it to everybody.
[01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:41.400]  This is ridiculous.
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:43.400]  Yeah, and no, and they're setting the stage.
[01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:46.400]  They are asserting their power the way they operate,
[01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:51.400]  sending in an armed hit squad to a man who is a peaceable,
[01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:54.400]  a most peaceable man I know, unless attacked, of course.
[01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:58.400]  But he's signal many times, don't swat team me.
[01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:00.400]  I'm ready to turn myself in.
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:01.400]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:02.400]  Why was that necessary?
[01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:06.400]  Was it really necessary to, you know, ransack his house or whatever they did?
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:08.400]  And fortunately, I will say, I dealt with them.
[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:10.400]  The FBI agents are courteous.
[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:12.400]  You know, they're doing their job.
[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:15.400]  But they're following orders of a rogue criminal cartel.
[01:53:15.400 --> 01:53:16.400]  They are.
[01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:18.400]  And, you know, where, where, where is the president?
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:19.400]  Okay.
[01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:21.400]  The president has, in my opinion, tweeting,
[01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:24.400]  I have to agree with Roger is not getting it anymore.
[01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:26.400]  He needs to, it's unfortunate.
[01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:28.400]  He's let it, I think, go too far at this point.
[01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:30.400]  It's going to have to go to its natural conclusion.
[01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:32.400]  Roger is being, has been framed.
[01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:35.400]  I mean, this is, you know, it's funny because in September of 17,
[01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:39.400]  Tyler, you know, my dad, they're, they're literally calling up like,
[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:42.400]  Oh, Jones, you're not afraid, we'll put your dad in prison.
[01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:43.400]  My dad.
[01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:45.400]  Oh, no, nobody is off limits.
[01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:47.400]  They will, they will take everything that you have.
[01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:48.400]  He's ready.
[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:49.400]  My dad's ready.
[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:50.400]  He's taking.
[01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:51.400]  Yeah.
[01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:52.400]  Your dad's a patriot.
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:53.400]  Take them all.
[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:54.400]  Let's go.
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:55.400]  I enjoyed sitting with him and chatting.
[01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:56.400]  He was an oral surgeon.
[01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:57.400]  I believe my father, same thing.
[01:53:57.400 --> 01:53:58.400]  Dentist lifelong.
[01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:01.400]  You know, what we're up against, people need to realize this isn't left versus
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:02.400]  right.
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:03.400]  This isn't Democrat versus Republican.
[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:06.400]  This is fascist versus freedom fighters.
[01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:09.400]  And exactly when I got to the point where I literally had to be ready to cut myself
[01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:13.400]  loose and, and everything else in my dad loose and people understand that's where
[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:16.400]  we are because the alternative is so much more evil.
[01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:20.400]  I don't want to be up here standing like this at the parapet, but I know we're facing
[01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:21.400]  real evil.
[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:22.400]  I have to.
[01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:24.400]  It's not even a question.
[01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:25.400]  Yep.
[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:28.400]  I served in the Berlin Brigade and I was proud to do so right when the,
[01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:33.400]  right after the wall came down and I saw firsthand what Soviet communism and its,
[01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:38.400]  and its satellite states and the oppression of socialism looked like 40 years after the
[01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:41.400]  war, there were still bullets scarred buildings.
[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:46.400]  You would drive through these streets of Potsdam or say, you know, any of these marginal cities
[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:49.400]  outside of West Berlin and it was a nightmare.
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:50.400]  It was dark.
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:51.400]  People didn't even come out of doors.
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:53.400]  There was no, no brightness, no life to it.
[01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:59.400]  This is what these people sit in the luxury and the wealth and the opulence of Western
[01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:05.400]  capitalism and Western enlightenment values and throw stones at it.
[01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:06.400]  Excuse the pun.
[01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:11.400]  You know, Roger has been throwing stones at them right back for years as a view and it's
[01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:12.400]  it.
[01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:15.400]  I'm almost speechless to like put my finger on it.
[01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:18.400]  It really can be disconcerting and I understand how you kind of have to catch yourself sometimes
[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:23.400]  because, you know, those of us who have seen this coming and have tried to warn our fellow
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:26.400]  citizens and say, look, this isn't a game.
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:28.400]  This isn't political gamesmanship here.
[01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:33.400]  We were talking about ruthless people who are not listeners that were that they're trying
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:34.400]  to indict me.
[01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:35.400]  Okay.
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:36.400]  It's going on.
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:38.400]  I mean, this is not stunts here.
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:39.400]  We're not doing this play.
[01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:40.400]  Patty cake.
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:41.400]  You could say something.
[01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:43.400]  These Sandy Hook lawsuits.
[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:49.400]  Um, this is just, that's just a tactic to, to basically dig into your personal finances,
[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:52.400]  the finances of any thing that they can.
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:54.400]  They got all the other bank accounts shut down.
[01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:56.400]  They want to figure out a totally shut us down.
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:55:57.400]  They admit it.
[01:55:57.400 --> 01:55:59.400]  It's a literal police state.
[01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:01.400]  Well, see, I don't want to be the guy crying.
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:02.400]  Oh my God, they've got me.
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:07.400]  I just want listeners to know that one problem is we're, we're too confident on one end.
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:12.400]  But if I wanted to really go up and shoot the bat signal out, we need to be flooded with
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:13.400]  money.
[01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:17.400]  And I know for a fact less than 1% of people buy products on a regular basis.
[01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:21.400]  If just a few percentage, we would have everything we needed to defeat these people.
[01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:22.400]  But it's how God works.
[01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:23.400]  We always just, just get enough.
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:27.400]  But if I didn't have to spend time and I'm not bitching, going around, if people say,
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:29.400]  why don't you just throw Roger overboard?
[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:34.400]  Or why don't you, because that's, he didn't do the things they said because I like Roger.
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:35.400]  He's a funny, smart guy.
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:39.400]  You know, he takes on this label because they called him as the bad guy.
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:40.400]  It's not true.
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:43.400]  He's, he's always telling me, let's not say that it's not completely true.
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:46.400]  Even though I'm not lying, he thinks it's too far.
[01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:47.400]  He knows truth to the power.
[01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:49.400]  Have you ever heard Roger tell a lie?
[01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:54.400]  No, and that's why I asked a reporter who I was sparring with practically, you know,
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:58.400]  should you have to spar with these people because they're handing you the party line,
[01:56:58.400 --> 01:56:59.400]  their party line.
[01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:05.400]  And I said, can you just tell me one documented proven lie that Roger Stone is told publicly
[01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:08.400]  or elsewhere that, and he's, I mean, sat and he didn't respond.
[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:10.400]  He moved on to the next question.
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:12.400]  I've asked other people that, no, they can't.
[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:14.400]  Because he knows truth to the power.
[01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:15.400]  I mean, me too.
[01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:16.400]  Stay right there.
[01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:17.400]  Come back.
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:18.400]  We got another guest popping in.
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:19.400]  He's probably popping in at the end of the hour.
[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:20.400]  There's big developments coming.
[01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:24.400]  There's going to be one place you can come to and hear what's happening because he's
[01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:25.400]  their big move on the president.
[01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:28.400]  It's just like Dershowitz and others have said, obviously they keep lying to him saying,
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:30.400]  Mr. President, we know you're not a Russian.
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:31.400]  We know there's no Russians.
[01:57:31.400 --> 01:57:35.400]  And I'm not mad at the press secretary, but her throwing stone under the bus is pretty
[01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:36.400]  sick.
[01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:38.400]  And we'll talk about it all with Mr. Nixon on the other side.
[01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:41.400]  Remember, we need financial support now and we got products you need.

[02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:24.400]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:27.400]  You know my mom in 25 years I've been on air.
[02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:32.400]  24 and a half has gotten mad at some of the things I've said or done but when she learned
[02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:37.400]  they're trying to indict my dad for made up stuff man she just said we're good people
[02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:41.400]  we love God and you just get out there and kick their ass and he's strong.
[02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:47.400]  That's the thing is they don't intimidate me they make me angry that we have such a cancer
[02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:53.400]  of scum who hate the country and who are selling it out and who say America was never great
[02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:58.400]  they'll never be great and then they turn around and they have nothing two plus years later
[02:00:58.400 --> 02:01:01.400]  on what we've done and then I'll say it.
[02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:05.400]  The president sits there with Sarah Huckabee Sanders who I try to defend but when she shows
[02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:07.400]  at the end of the day she's being a politician.
[02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:09.400]  There's nothing to do with the president.
[02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:11.400]  It has everything to do with the president.
[02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:12.400]  Yeah there's no Russiagate.
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:13.400]  Yeah there's nothing there.
[02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:14.400]  Exactly.
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:20.400]  So you sit there on your ass when you and your daddy to get up off your fat asses and mobilize
[02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:24.400]  the troops to stand up for what's right then we beat this.
[02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:26.400]  They'll get you next lady.
[02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:29.400]  Tyler Nixon lawyer, spokesperson for Stone.
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:31.400]  What do you say about that?
[02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:34.400]  I'm really disappointed that there's not more.
[02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:39.400]  There's a circle within the Trump, well within the White House, within the larger emanating
[02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:45.400]  I guess out of the White House and the campaign of people who do not have any concern or care
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:48.400]  or interest in Roger Stone because they know that he's brilliant.
[02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:52.400]  They know that his legacy and his heritage or his, you know.
[02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:56.400]  They know that info wars of Stone and all of us the listeners got him elected and they're
[02:01:56.400 --> 02:01:57.400]  all hacks.
[02:01:57.400 --> 02:01:59.400]  We don't want to go attach ourselves to DC.
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:01.400]  Stone didn't ask for a job in DC.
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:02.400]  Exactly.
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:04.400]  DC has his competition.
[02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:07.400]  Instead they ought to be listening to us and I know the president and a few others do listen.
[02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:08.400]  But you're right.
[02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:11.400]  They're very angry that we're the real brain trust and they're not.
[02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:12.400]  Exactly dumbasses.
[02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:14.400]  We didn't come from where you are.
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:15.400]  We built our own thing.
[02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:20.400]  We called the country jackasses.
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:21.400]  Testify my brother.
[02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:22.400]  Let me tell you something.
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:26.400]  These people, it is time for the quizlings and for the ha...
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:30.400]  I mean we've got, I think we've rid ourselves very much so of the neocons thankfully.
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:33.400]  But there's still this element of Washington inside.
[02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:34.400]  That's right.
[02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:35.400]  We've got a chainsaw going outside your house.
[02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:37.400]  We'll come back with the leaf floors off.
[02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:38.400]  Exactly.
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:39.400]  Nationalism is exploding.
[02:02:39.400 --> 02:02:40.400]  Capitalism is exploding.
[02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:42.400]  People realize the threat of radical Islam.
[02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:43.400]  And America is awake.
[02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:44.400]  The young people are awake.
[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:46.400]  The neocons have been shoved out.
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:49.400]  And this is their whole counter offensive.
[02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:51.400]  And it'll crush those of us that are seen as leaders.
[02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:54.400]  But let's, even if they destroy us, let's not take that as a defeat.
[02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:59.400]  Because folks, we're winning the water war, aren't we, Tyler?
[02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:00.400]  Yeah.
[02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:02.400]  Sorry, I got deep state landscaping working.
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:03.400]  I know how it works, brother.
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:05.400]  I used to be out of my house doing shows.
[02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:07.400]  Like Nelson, the Leap Lord, man.
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:11.400]  Is someone I have the utmost respect for as I do you, Alex.
[02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:16.400]  You guys are the stalwarts who have held this, the glue that has held this movement together
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:22.400]  and keeps people going, frankly, who have despaired in the face of the Clintonian Obama cabal
[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:26.400]  that has co-opted our government, abused our justice system,
[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:32.400]  corrupted every process of government they can while they install their deep state puppets
[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:39.400]  and minions in there to basically spend tens of millions of taxpayer dollars that people worked hard for
[02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:45.400]  to pursue this laughable Kafkaesque inquisition against stone you and others.
[02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:47.400]  I mean, it boggles the mind.
[02:03:47.400 --> 02:03:51.400]  And it's like, where are the adults in the room?
[02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:53.400]  Where are the righteous people?
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:58.400]  I mean, they've literally, I think the years of Clinton, Bush and Obama drained the swamp,
[02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:04.400]  literally, well, not drained the swamp, but it rid Washington, D.C. of anybody with any integrity left.
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:08.400]  I mean, my God, you have Rand Paul folks like that, but they're outliers anymore.
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:13.400]  Lindsey Graham and these folks need to realize, I mean, I don't know if they're trying to sue,
[02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:17.400]  say Trump into whatever his fate may be at the hands of the deep state.
[02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:19.400]  But let me say what it is.
[02:04:19.400 --> 02:04:21.400]  We're gonna come back and finish up with you and go to our next guest.
[02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:23.400]  You make great points. Please join us in the war.
[02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:25.400]  I'll be staying up here until late tonight.
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:26.400]  Tyler Nixon.
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:32.400]  There's still that weird political detente, that senatorial stuff, but the globalists are ignoring it.
[02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:34.400]  So they go say, hey, we're suing for peace.
[02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:35.400]  Let's make a compromise.
[02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:40.400]  But every time they turn against it, the old senators with all their money and their mistresses and golf courses,
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:44.400]  they have an incentive not to be young men and fight or soldiers like yourself.
[02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:46.400]  And listen, I don't want to fight either unless I have to.
[02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:49.400]  I can't sign on to a freaking pedophile system.
[02:04:49.400 --> 02:04:52.400]  We'll be back with final comments from Tyler Nixon straight ahead.
[02:04:52.400 --> 02:05:20.400]  And our next guest joins us with what Roder's showing today. Stay with us.
[02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:28.400]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water, and enjoy.
[02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:36.400]  With 14 servings per box for a two-week or more supply, this is the formula to stock up on whenever you need a boost.
[02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:40.400]  Perfect for work, in the car, or at home.
[02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:43.400]  Turboforce is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[02:05:43.400 --> 02:05:45.400]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:56.400]  Perk Up with Turboforce at infowarstore.com.
[02:05:56.400 --> 02:06:13.400]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:21.400]  29 FBI SWAT team members slammed into Roger Stone's home, pointed guns at him and his wife and dogs,
[02:06:21.400 --> 02:06:28.400]  took him to jail for saying he lied about trying to talk to WikiLeaks, which is totally legal, and he didn't lie.
[02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:33.400]  But that's the war on journalists, where those that bring in MS-13 and drug dealers and child-kitten efforts
[02:06:33.400 --> 02:06:38.400]  and radical e-moms, federal courts rule, can cut their daughters, genitals off at age nine.
[02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:44.400]  That's all okay, you can give uranium on tarmacs to foreign governments like Russia, like Robert Mueller.
[02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:49.400]  Because at the end of the day, they think America's a bunch of schmucks, and then they come like buzzsaw from The Running Man.
[02:06:49.400 --> 02:07:18.400]  But they're a big old chainsaw, cutting up what our forebears and veterans built.
[02:07:18.400 --> 02:07:25.400]  Here comes Mueller.
[02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:29.400]  Cut that constitution up.
[02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:31.400]  He's Deep State.
[02:07:31.400 --> 02:07:36.400]  Buzzsaw's invincible.
[02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:45.400]  Deep State's invincible.
[02:07:45.400 --> 02:08:06.400]  Ooh, but watch out what you get connected to.
[02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:16.400]  You can only drag America along for so long.
[02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:18.400]  You know how much America sees through this?
[02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:20.400]  Nobody's buying it.
[02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:24.400]  Even that whore press ordered a boo, so that Roger couldn't speak.
[02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:26.400]  You know how it sounds, America.
[02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:43.400]  If you're shooting it right now, you're going to spread the word about it in FullWords.com, so you'll be able to hear the truth of what's happening.
[02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:49.400]  Oh, and then you know what happens next.
[02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:56.400]  All right, Tyler Nixon, the spokesperson for Roger Stone, has already been on with this for over an hour today.
[02:08:56.400 --> 02:09:00.400]  He'll be joining us again coming up in the war room in about an hour, live linked, drudgereport.com.
[02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:04.400]  He tried to come out, tried to give a speech, tried to talk, tried to take questions.
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:06.400]  They just screamed, you're a Russian.
[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:13.400]  Yes, we're the ones that want more jobs in America and defend our border and bigger defense budgets and space-based defense systems.
[02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:14.400]  Oh, that's the Russians.
[02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:16.400]  The Russians are crapping their pants.
[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:19.400]  The whole world government order doesn't know what to do.
[02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:30.400]  You can even disagree with some of what Trump does, but you can't disagree that he's making America strong and great again.
[02:09:30.400 --> 02:09:34.400]  So they are trying to stop Tyler Nixon's final comments on that.
[02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:36.400]  Hey, something.
[02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:40.400]  This guy literally started this up right after the break and then I think he has somebody.
[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:41.400]  That's why I did the buzzsaw.
[02:09:41.400 --> 02:09:42.400]  It's awesome.
[02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:43.400]  That's why we got buzzsaw coming in here.
[02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:45.400]  Yeah, let me tell you something.
[02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:57.400]  Robert Mueller, hairmuller of the Heimstanz-Polizei American style has, in my opinion, just validated Roger Stone, validated in the wars, validated everything you've been saying all along.
[02:09:57.400 --> 02:10:10.400]  They are exactly what we've said they're about all along, which is about power, control, and the ruthless mercenary use of our government, what was once our government, I should say,
[02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:19.400]  to carry out the political personal objectives of ruthless criminals like the Clintons, the Obama ilk.
[02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:28.400]  And I'm sure they're celebrating and they're dancing their little jig in the comment sections of the screeching, squealing degenerate left.
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:32.400]  I mean, if you read through some of these comments, these people, they're living on another planet.
[02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:35.400]  They've literally constructed these fantasies in their mind.
[02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:40.400]  And what I like about you, Alex, excuse me, and about Roger in Info Wars, you are straightforward.
[02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:41.400]  You're down to earth.
[02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:42.400]  You're real people.
[02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:43.400]  You're genuine.
[02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:49.400]  We need everybody in this cause now needs the support of everyone out there.
[02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:55.400]  If you didn't think Roger Stone was being serious about how they're coming for him and they're going to come for the president next.
[02:10:55.400 --> 02:10:56.400]  They're coming for Alex.
[02:10:56.400 --> 02:11:02.400]  Anybody they can eliminate in this purge, this liquidation of their political parties.
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:05.400]  That's right. This is game time. This is the takedown of the country.
[02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:07.400]  Now they say I'm the next target, my dad.
[02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:17.400]  I mean, this is just insanity, but they don't care because they're a lawless group of criminals changing the subject from them with uranium one and Hillary with the uranium and the hundred plus million.
[02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:19.400]  We must have a special counsel.
[02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:26.400]  But what about this new attorney general who is literally Robert Mueller's daddy for George Herbert Walker and the CIA that brought him in?
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:28.400]  It just shows how Trump's being lied to on all sides.
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:34.400]  This is where I just I questioned the president's choice in terms of who he's having counsel him.
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:37.400]  Listen, William Barr is praised by Joe DeGeneva.
[02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:44.400]  Joe DeGeneva is clearly a very, very pro-Trump anti-Muller, anti-cabal individual.
[02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:47.400]  But, you know, it's just it's about being aggressive.
[02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:49.400]  I guess we need to stop there.
[02:11:49.400 --> 02:11:52.400]  I'm always about suing for peace if we're on the winning side for everything.
[02:11:52.400 --> 02:12:00.400]  So they want to go into abstention and Mueller and others that were minions of the Clintons want to stop being criminals and want to back off.
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:01.400]  That's one thing.
[02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:03.400]  But no, this is clear.
[02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:04.400]  They're going ahead with the fraud.
[02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:06.400]  We don't want a civil war.
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:08.400]  Most analysts say they're going to start one.
[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:09.400]  This is so dangerous.
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:13.400]  They really are, you know, and it's going to come down to that because our government is no longer our own.
[02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:21.400]  When I say are, I mean, the people, the citizenry as being, I mean, when you see a private citizen and you notice that no one that Mueller and his team go after.
[02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:22.400]  Actually, he's in government.
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:23.400]  Are they?
[02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:24.400]  It's all private citizens.
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:25.400]  That's very interesting.
[02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:31.400]  I find not that I'm saying that they should be going after anybody necessarily, but it's just curious that it's always the low hang.
[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:32.400]  The easy target.
[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:33.400]  It's incredible.
[02:12:33.400 --> 02:12:34.400]  It's transparent.
[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:35.400]  It's out of control.
[02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:36.400]  Thank you.
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:38.400]  We'll talk to you again in the war room coming up today with Roger Stone in full wars.com.
[02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:39.400]  Four slash show live feeds.
[02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:40.400]  Thank you so much.
[02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:41.400]  All right.
[02:12:41.400 --> 02:12:43.400]  Jacob Ingalls, we're going to come to you.
[02:12:43.400 --> 02:12:45.400]  He's a publisher of Central Florida Post.
[02:12:45.400 --> 02:12:46.400]  Good friends with Roger just in town.
[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:50.400]  A few months ago, Roger and I went out to dinner, noting for a few years with New Dawn magazine.
[02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:54.400]  He submitted a truth journalism on a local level.
[02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:56.400]  So we're going to be talking to him.
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:12:57.400]  Another good friend of Roger's.
[02:12:57.400 --> 02:13:01.400]  He was down there today to get his take on this whole hysterical situation on the other side.
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:09.400]  Listen, I've gotten so busy the last month, focusing just on news that we've lost a million dollars.
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:10.400]  And that means a million dollars.
[02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:11.400]  We need to fund things.
[02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:15.400]  Buzzfeed has $300 million a day.
[02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:16.400]  Let me just tell you.
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:20.400]  They get $300 million a year.
[02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:26.400]  Globalist Foundation funding and sponsorship and they lose $100 million.
[02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:30.400]  Now, that's $100 million where it's all money.
[02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:35.400]  If I sell a million dollars with a product on average, we make $500,000.
[02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:39.400]  Then we pay for the bandwidth, the crew, the licensing, everything else.
[02:13:39.400 --> 02:13:45.400]  And it's not about how much money I get as you see, but maybe I get out of a million dollars, maybe 50,000.
[02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:49.400]  Then I pay for lawyers, all the rest of the BS taxes and basically make nothing.
[02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:50.400]  It's not about the money.
[02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:52.400]  It's about fuel for war.
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:53.400]  It's about ammo.
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:55.400]  I'm on the front line ready to go to the end.
[02:13:55.400 --> 02:13:56.400]  God, I want to go to the end.
[02:13:56.400 --> 02:14:01.400]  But I need funding and I don't do a good enough job to explain, hey, we're the zeitgeist.
[02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:03.400]  We're the tip of the spear, baby.
[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:09.400]  Buzzfeed, which employs 1,300 people, generated more than $300 million in 2018.
[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:12.400]  But still, they got to get $100 million.
[02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:18.400]  Doc McHamshaw, please, $100 million infused by Soros and others.
[02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:20.400]  Zoom in on that 300 million.
[02:14:20.400 --> 02:14:26.400]  So, see, they got folks to illegally give the New York Times stuff from my divorce five years ago.
[02:14:26.400 --> 02:14:29.400]  And it said, Jones makes $24 million a year.
[02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:30.400]  No, that was our gross.
[02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:35.400]  I made about $2 million a year and paid for it all with lawyers and, you know, after taxes.
[02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:39.400]  But the point is, is that it sounds like a lot.
[02:14:39.400 --> 02:14:40.400]  It's nothing.
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:42.400]  $300 million.
[02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:44.400]  We're way bigger than they are.
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:47.400]  We're organic, bringing in $45 million a year now.
[02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:49.400]  That was five years ago, $27 million.
[02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:51.400]  We tried to bring in $45 million.
[02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:53.400]  Now I've got $20 million to work with.
[02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:57.400]  After all the bandwidth, taxes, I mean, today will be hundreds of thousands of dollars in bandwidth.
[02:14:57.400 --> 02:14:58.400]  We're so gigantic right now.
[02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:00.400]  That person doesn't buy anything.
[02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:01.400]  Fine.
[02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:04.400]  So then I end up with a few million, pay it to lawyers, have nothing.
[02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:07.400]  And I'm like, well, I could sell my house and fund the place another three months.
[02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:09.400]  You see where we're getting into here.
[02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:10.400]  I can't get in that position.
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:11.400]  I don't give a rat's ass.
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:15.400]  I mean, even about my own body, when it comes to war, I just need the fuel.
[02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:17.400]  So we're down to this, folks.
[02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:19.400]  We're down to the wire.
[02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:21.400]  Bringing in $45 million this year.
[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:22.400]  The way they've shut us down.
[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:24.400]  We're lucky it was $30 million this year.
[02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:26.400]  And I'll have to lay people off and start shutting down.
[02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:32.400]  So, because again, 30 million gross, half of its product costs, it's $15 million.
[02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:36.400]  I've got 10, $5, $10 million or whatever it is in bandwidth cost.
[02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:38.400]  You're like, oh, just do it yourself.
[02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:39.400]  I'm doing it myself.
[02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:42.400]  I'm fighting as hard as I can, but I need you to commit and go, damn it.
[02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:51.400]  I'm going to go to inforwarstore.com and I'm going to buy the best products, the best fish oil, the best brain boost, the best turbo force.

[02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:53.400]  It's a war.
[02:15:53.400 --> 02:15:54.400]  Help us.
[02:15:54.400 --> 02:15:58.400]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:05.400]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally at heart and body extract?

[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:25.400]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:25.400 --> 02:16:29.400]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:29.400 --> 02:16:31.400]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:34.400]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:40.400]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:02.400]  There is no un-continuum.
[02:19:02.400 --> 02:19:05.400]  The continuum is always launching forward in the future.
[02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:08.400]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[02:19:08.400 --> 02:19:10.400]  We won't just be here 100 years, we'll be here forever.
[02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:17.400]  We'll turn the whole thing around. Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say,
[02:19:17.400 --> 02:19:19.400]  we struggled here, we made it.
[02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:21.400]  And that's really where this goes.
[02:19:21.400 --> 02:19:23.400]  God's got a big war for you, Reddy.
[02:19:23.400 --> 02:19:28.400]  And so if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong,
[02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:30.400]  are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:35.400]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:38.400]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:40.400]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[02:19:40.400 --> 02:19:44.400]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[02:19:44.400 --> 02:19:45.400]  I want to go to the next level.
[02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:50.400]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers.
[02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:52.400]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[02:19:52.400 --> 02:20:08.400]  I want life. I want Jesus.
[02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:35.400]  When I grow up, I want to be a rock star.
[02:20:35.400 --> 02:20:41.400]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[02:20:41.400 --> 02:20:52.400]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:54.400]  We're going to Jacob Ingalls.
[02:20:54.400 --> 02:20:57.400]  We're going to have the phones in the next hour of another guest joining us.
[02:20:57.400 --> 02:20:59.400]  I'm going to stay here and co-host the war room.
[02:20:59.400 --> 02:21:05.400]  We're joining us again next hour, global exclusive, unable to go out and speak to the press, the biggest press conference I've ever seen.
[02:21:05.400 --> 02:21:08.400]  Probably the biggest ever, like three times the size of the OJ Simpson.
[02:21:08.400 --> 02:21:10.400]  And they wouldn't let him talk.
[02:21:10.400 --> 02:21:13.400]  It was the press booing and saying, shut up, because they're not the press.
[02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:15.400]  But the president, as we speak, start rolling it.
[02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:19.400]  He's in the middle of his comments about another compromise, which I get.
[02:21:19.400 --> 02:21:23.400]  The Democrats want no compromise, no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[02:21:23.400 --> 02:21:25.400]  So he's compromised on everything now.
[02:21:25.400 --> 02:21:34.400]  I am very proud to announce today that we have reached a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government.
[02:21:34.400 --> 02:21:36.400]  A few minutes ago.
[02:21:36.400 --> 02:21:40.400]  Yay.
[02:21:40.400 --> 02:21:43.400]  As everyone knows, I have a very powerful-
[02:21:43.400 --> 02:21:47.400]  You know they did the stone raid to overshadow this deal that we wanted to use at this time.
[02:21:47.400 --> 02:21:51.400]  Hopefully it will be unnecessary.
[02:21:51.400 --> 02:21:58.400]  I want to thank all of the incredible federal workers and their amazing families who have shown such extraordinary devotion.
[02:21:58.400 --> 02:22:00.400]  And the ones at SWAT team, Roger Stowe.
[02:22:00.400 --> 02:22:03.400]  In the face of this recent hardship.
[02:22:03.400 --> 02:22:05.400]  You are fantastic people.
[02:22:05.400 --> 02:22:08.400]  You are incredible patriots.
[02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:16.400]  Many of you have suffered far greater than anyone, but your families would know or understand.
[02:22:16.400 --> 02:22:20.400]  And not only did you not complain,
[02:22:20.400 --> 02:22:28.400]  but in many cases you encouraged me to keep going because you care so much about our country and its border security.
[02:22:28.400 --> 02:22:31.400]  But, again, thank you.
[02:22:31.400 --> 02:22:33.400]  North Texas air traffic controllers quit their damn job.
[02:22:33.400 --> 02:22:37.400]  And Trump should declare the emergency like Reagan and act like a damn boss.
[02:22:37.400 --> 02:22:41.400]  People are very special people.
[02:22:41.400 --> 02:22:45.400]  I am so proud that you are citizens of our country.
[02:22:45.400 --> 02:22:48.400]  When I say, make America great again.
[02:22:48.400 --> 02:22:51.400]  Trump doesn't take him being nice as good.
[02:22:51.400 --> 02:22:53.400]  They take him as weakness.
[02:22:53.400 --> 02:22:55.400]  Without you, great people.
[02:22:55.400 --> 02:23:02.400]  In a short while, I will sign a bill to open our government for three weeks until February 15.
[02:23:02.400 --> 02:23:05.400]  I wonder if they arrest me as Sarah Sandels says nothing to do with the president.
[02:23:05.400 --> 02:23:07.400]  Yeah, you dumb cow.
[02:23:07.400 --> 02:23:09.400]  Has the old America, you slob.
[02:23:09.400 --> 02:23:13.400]  Very quickly or as soon as possible.
[02:23:13.400 --> 02:23:15.400]  It will happen fast.
[02:23:15.400 --> 02:23:19.400]  I'm asking to try to get Roger to frame the president, you dumb cow.
[02:23:19.400 --> 02:23:22.400]  To put this proposal on the floor immediately.
[02:23:22.400 --> 02:23:24.400]  I'm starting to get pissed.
[02:23:24.400 --> 02:23:27.400]  After 36 days of spirited debate and dialogue,
[02:23:27.400 --> 02:23:33.400]  I have seen and heard from enough Democrats and Republicans
[02:23:33.400 --> 02:23:39.400]  that they are willing to put partisanship aside,
[02:23:39.400 --> 02:23:45.400]  I think, and put the security of the American people first.
[02:23:45.400 --> 02:23:48.400]  Really, I don't see any damn way they're going to do that.
[02:23:48.400 --> 02:23:52.400]  They have said they are for complete border security,
[02:23:52.400 --> 02:23:57.400]  and they have finally and fully acknowledged that having...
[02:23:57.400 --> 02:24:01.400]  I said move Matthew Pelosi's ass into an MS-13 meth den.
[02:24:01.400 --> 02:24:06.400]  Whatever you want to call it will be an important part of the solution.
[02:24:06.400 --> 02:24:15.400]  A bipartisan conference committee of House and Senate lawmakers and leaders
[02:24:15.400 --> 02:24:20.400]  will immediately begin reviewing the requests of our homeland security experts
[02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:22.400]  and experts they are.
[02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:24.400]  That does sound like a kidding about the Democrats, though,
[02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:26.400]  to give them a way out to experts.
[02:24:26.400 --> 02:24:27.400]  So maybe Trump's going to be right.
[02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:30.400]  All I know is appoint a special counsel.
[02:24:30.400 --> 02:24:32.400]  Okay, that's enough of this.
[02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:33.400]  We know what's happening.
[02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:38.400]  They're all punting and what shows both sides kind of blinked.
[02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:40.400]  Let's go to Jacob Ingalls.
[02:24:40.400 --> 02:24:41.400]  He's the publisher of Central Florida Post,
[02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:43.400]  contributor to the new Dawn magazine.
[02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:46.400]  He is committed to the truth journalism on local level.
[02:24:46.400 --> 02:24:50.400]  Twitter at Jacob Ingalls, Central Florida Post.
[02:24:50.400 --> 02:24:51.400]  I've known him for years.
[02:24:51.400 --> 02:24:53.400]  I had him all many times at dinner with him at Roger Fusco.
[02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:55.400]  I was out with a gay guy at dinner.
[02:24:55.400 --> 02:24:56.400]  What the frickin' do?
[02:24:56.400 --> 02:24:57.400]  I could care less if you're gay or straight.
[02:24:57.400 --> 02:24:58.400]  But I won't even add these gays.
[02:24:58.400 --> 02:25:01.400]  They say all gay people support the Democrats.
[02:25:01.400 --> 02:25:03.400]  It was just a total canard.
[02:25:03.400 --> 02:25:05.400]  What do you make of this?
[02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:07.400]  I mean, you were at the Women's March, the Insanity.
[02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:09.400]  Now this, I'm not trying to just bash Trump.
[02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:13.400]  My days of sitting there while he lets Mueller run roughshot everybody,
[02:25:13.400 --> 02:25:14.400]  and I'm done.
[02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:17.400]  I want uranium-1 special prosecutors.
[02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:19.400]  I want Hillary's ass investigated, dammit.
[02:25:19.400 --> 02:25:22.400]  I mean, my daddy's getting investigated for Russiagate
[02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:23.400]  when there's nothing there now.
[02:25:23.400 --> 02:25:26.400]  I want that frickin' whore that sold this country
[02:25:26.400 --> 02:25:28.400]  out to anybody that would buy us off.
[02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:31.400]  I want that whore indicted!
[02:25:31.400 --> 02:25:35.400]  No, that disgusting fat poor Hillary Clinton needs to be in prison.
[02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:37.400]  If they're going to do this to Roger Stone,
[02:25:37.400 --> 02:25:39.400]  we must see indictments of other people.
[02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:42.400]  And if not, the citizens and great patriots and co-warriors,
[02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:45.400]  freedom lovers must stand up and take to the streets
[02:25:45.400 --> 02:25:47.400]  and make citizens arrest.
[02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:49.400]  We must hold government accountable.
[02:25:49.400 --> 02:25:51.400]  What happened today to Roger Stone?
[02:25:51.400 --> 02:25:52.400]  It could happen to me.
[02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:53.400]  It could happen to you, Alex.
[02:25:53.400 --> 02:25:55.400]  That's why it's vitally important that people support it.
[02:25:55.400 --> 02:25:56.400]  It could happen to me.
[02:25:56.400 --> 02:25:57.400]  I'm in the frickin' Washington Post.
[02:25:57.400 --> 02:26:00.400]  They're saying, do we give hush money to a reporter we hired?
[02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:02.400]  These people never frickin' in, man.
[02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:04.400]  It's bullshit. It's bullshit.
[02:26:04.400 --> 02:26:06.400]  And when you see Sarah Huckabee Sanders
[02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:08.400]  and when you see her make that statement,
[02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:10.400]  we need strong support from this White House.
[02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:11.400]  We need strong support.
[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:13.400]  I mean, you agree with me that we'll play it when we come out
[02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:14.400]  from break, that her...
[02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:16.400]  Oh, this has nothing to do with us.
[02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:17.400]  Nothing to do with us.
[02:26:17.400 --> 02:26:19.400]  Trump's saying, get me the WikiLeaks.
[02:26:19.400 --> 02:26:20.400]  That's totally normal.
[02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:21.400]  Everybody was trying to get him.
[02:26:21.400 --> 02:26:22.400]  Stone goes out and tries to get him.
[02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:23.400]  Doesn't get him.
[02:26:23.400 --> 02:26:25.400]  And then he's going to go to prison for that?
[02:26:25.400 --> 02:26:27.400]  And then Huckabee sits there?
[02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:29.400]  Frickin' he's a human being, lady.
[02:26:29.400 --> 02:26:31.400]  God, I don't want to like her.
[02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:32.400]  She's just a left of taxer.
[02:26:32.400 --> 02:26:34.400]  But Jesus, with friends like this man,
[02:26:34.400 --> 02:26:36.400]  we don't need Democrats.
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:38.400]  No, no, no.
[02:26:38.400 --> 02:26:39.400]  We need strong patriots.
[02:26:39.400 --> 02:26:41.400]  People who are listening right now
[02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:44.400]  to get up, stand up, and get out in the streets.
[02:26:44.400 --> 02:26:46.400]  How long are we going to sit here
[02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:48.400]  and wait for the other shooter to drop?
[02:26:48.400 --> 02:26:49.400]  Well, we talked at 8 a.m. this morning
[02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:50.400]  and you were shaking.
[02:26:50.400 --> 02:26:51.400]  I was shaking when I called you.
[02:26:51.400 --> 02:26:52.400]  You just learned.
[02:26:52.400 --> 02:26:55.400]  I mean, this is like 50 times the red scare.
[02:26:55.400 --> 02:26:56.400]  This is real.
[02:26:56.400 --> 02:26:57.400]  This is Nazi Germany.
[02:26:57.400 --> 02:26:58.400]  This is Soviet Union, man.
[02:26:58.400 --> 02:26:59.400]  This ain't a joke.
[02:26:59.400 --> 02:27:01.400]  This is real.
[02:27:01.400 --> 02:27:03.400]  Well, and the left has been telling us
[02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:06.400]  for two years that we are in the Fourth Reich,
[02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:08.400]  that we are under Hitler.
[02:27:08.400 --> 02:27:09.400]  And you know what?
[02:27:09.400 --> 02:27:11.400]  I'm going to admit they are right.
[02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:12.400]  We are in the Fourth Reich.
[02:27:12.400 --> 02:27:13.400]  We are under Hitler.
[02:27:13.400 --> 02:27:15.400]  And the furor's name is Robert Mueller.
[02:27:15.400 --> 02:27:18.400]  Robert Mueller is running a Gestapo-style hit squad
[02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:20.400]  that is silencing political enemies.
[02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:22.400]  And how far will he go?
[02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:24.400]  He will go as far to bring SWAT teams
[02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:27.400]  to a peaceful man's home in the middle
[02:27:27.400 --> 02:27:30.400]  of the night early morning, terrorize his family,
[02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:32.400]  terrorize his wife, terrorize his dogs.
[02:27:32.400 --> 02:27:33.400]  And that is sick.
[02:27:33.400 --> 02:27:35.400]  It is raw power.
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:38.400]  And American citizens must stand up now
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:39.400]  more than ever.
[02:27:39.400 --> 02:27:41.400]  What are patriots going to do?
[02:27:41.400 --> 02:27:43.400]  We must support the InfaWars.
[02:27:43.400 --> 02:27:45.400]  We must support Roger Stone.
[02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:47.400]  Go on, buy something on InfaWars.com.
[02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:49.400]  Go and donate at Stone Defense Fund.
[02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:51.400]  By the way, Jacob, you know, if they don't support
[02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:53.400]  Roger or me or others, then I don't even really care
[02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:54.400]  at the end of the day.
[02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:55.400]  You know what?
[02:27:55.400 --> 02:27:56.400]  Fine, folks, if you don't see what we've done,
[02:27:56.400 --> 02:27:57.400]  we're ready.
[02:27:57.400 --> 02:27:58.400]  I thank the listeners.
[02:27:58.400 --> 02:27:59.400]  This is show cut and dry.
[02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:02.400]  I can't imagine that America isn't more pissed.
[02:28:02.400 --> 02:28:03.400]  Like, I'm going to be sadder.
[02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:05.400]  It's like, glad there's no Russian collusion.
[02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:07.400]  It says it has nothing to do with the White House.
[02:28:07.400 --> 02:28:08.400]  Oh, great.
[02:28:08.400 --> 02:28:11.400]  Cut him loose when Trump called him a hero a few months ago.
[02:28:11.400 --> 02:28:13.400]  It's like, that is like blood in the water.
[02:28:13.400 --> 02:28:16.400]  But again, they're a bunch of damn cowards.
[02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:18.400]  We need wartime presidents.
[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:19.400]  We need it for our country.
[02:28:19.400 --> 02:28:23.400]  We need people committed to this damn country.
[02:28:23.400 --> 02:28:25.400]  Hell, yes, Alex.
[02:28:25.400 --> 02:28:26.400]  Let's get angry.
[02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:29.400]  Let's get wild, because if we don't do something now,
[02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:31.400]  what the F are we going to have?
[02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:32.400]  We're getting the false flags ready.
[02:28:32.400 --> 02:28:33.400]  They're going to make their move.
[02:28:33.400 --> 02:28:35.400]  They got their terror teams ready.
[02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:38.400]  All I know is I've committed my will to this,
[02:28:38.400 --> 02:28:40.400]  and I think we're going to win the end.
[02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:43.400]  Everybody has been maneuvered into whoever gets banned.
[02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:44.400]  Oh, don't defend them.
[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:45.400]  You'll get banned.
[02:28:45.400 --> 02:28:46.400]  They've already taught you how to be cowards.
[02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:48.400]  You've already failed lesson one.
[02:28:48.400 --> 02:29:17.400]  Now you'll fail forever if you don't wake up.

[02:33:18.400 --> 02:33:31.400]  Science has proven what the ancients documented and knew in their hearts.
[02:33:31.400 --> 02:33:35.400]  There are all these universes and worlds and systems around us
[02:33:35.400 --> 02:33:39.400]  that aren't perceivable to the eye, but are to the soul.
[02:33:39.400 --> 02:33:44.400]  And when I say that I've cut my own life loose out of my family,
[02:33:44.400 --> 02:33:47.400]  it's not that I don't love them more than ever.
[02:33:47.400 --> 02:33:52.400]  It's that in cutting them loose, I hit the next level of love
[02:33:52.400 --> 02:33:55.400]  in not giving into the fear, not giving into the bullying,
[02:33:55.400 --> 02:33:58.400]  understanding there's things bigger than just this life.
[02:33:58.400 --> 02:34:01.400]  And that we've gotten in this position because the average man
[02:34:01.400 --> 02:34:05.400]  just wants to act cool in front of other men and make more money
[02:34:05.400 --> 02:34:08.400]  and the average woman wants to do the same thing, act cool in front of women
[02:34:08.400 --> 02:34:11.400]  and have status. It's not real status. It's fake.
[02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:16.400]  Real will built civilization, real guts built everything we've got.
[02:34:16.400 --> 02:34:21.400]  And I see the average man today, and I don't think of myself as a tough guy,
[02:34:21.400 --> 02:34:26.400]  and compared to, it's true, my grandfathers and their grandfathers,
[02:34:26.400 --> 02:34:30.400]  they weren't trying to act manly. They were men.
[02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:33.400]  But they lived in a different age when everybody was basically a man,
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:35.400]  so there wasn't a big problem.
[02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:37.400]  They were strong. They were focused.
[02:34:37.400 --> 02:34:40.400]  They weren't controlled by what other people said.
[02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:43.400]  They had a rudder. They had a North Star.
[02:34:43.400 --> 02:34:48.400]  And I see us losing our ancestral strength.
[02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:51.400]  I see us losing our will.
[02:34:51.400 --> 02:34:57.400]  And I see people bowing and cowering, and I see that group of cowardly reporters,
[02:34:57.400 --> 02:34:59.400]  over a thousand of them, one of the biggest press conferences.
[02:34:59.400 --> 02:35:01.400]  We've got to look it up, but I've never seen anything like it.
[02:35:01.400 --> 02:35:03.400]  I think it's the biggest one ever.
[02:35:03.400 --> 02:35:06.400]  I mean, there's more damn reporters out at one gaggle,
[02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:09.400]  you know, than you'd see at the Royal Wedding.
[02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:14.400]  And it was them. I talked to Roger. He said, yeah, I know it was the buzz feeds
[02:35:14.400 --> 02:35:17.400]  and all of them howling and screaming, calling me a Russian agent.
[02:35:17.400 --> 02:35:20.400]  Right in front of everyone, stealing his speech.
[02:35:20.400 --> 02:35:24.400]  So afraid of what he might say, but they had to be there,
[02:35:24.400 --> 02:35:29.400]  because he was the sacrificial lamb, the total penultimate trigger for the takedown of Trump.
[02:35:29.400 --> 02:35:32.400]  And now here we are, and they couldn't get what they wanted.
[02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:37.400]  Jacob Ingalls, syndicated reporter, Twitter, Jacob Ingalls at Twitter,
[02:35:37.400 --> 02:35:44.400]  post.com. I don't know how to describe how our typo, how epic, how illustrative it is to have,
[02:35:44.400 --> 02:35:46.400]  we're on air with him at 30 minutes.
[02:35:46.400 --> 02:35:48.400]  I say, when you go out there, they're going to shut you down,
[02:35:48.400 --> 02:35:51.400]  talk about the attack on a free speech. He goes out, they won't let him talk.
[02:35:51.400 --> 02:35:56.400]  He leaves, no press other than regreport.com picks us up.
[02:35:56.400 --> 02:36:00.400]  It's the discipline of the so-called press, but they're not the press.
[02:36:00.400 --> 02:36:02.400]  What would you call them?
[02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:05.400]  Killers of truth, killers of language, false narrative projectors.
[02:36:05.400 --> 02:36:07.400]  What are they?
[02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:09.400]  They're activist propagandists.
[02:36:09.400 --> 02:36:12.400]  These are people who would have been the first hires for Joseph Goebbels
[02:36:12.400 --> 02:36:17.400]  as he was appointed right minister of propaganda in 1933 Germany.
[02:36:17.400 --> 02:36:20.400]  These people are not fair. They're not fair-minded.
[02:36:20.400 --> 02:36:24.400]  They're political acts. They're rubbing elbows with the Mueller team.
[02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:30.400]  They're infested by that corrupt swamp that Trump is trying to drain
[02:36:30.400 --> 02:36:34.400]  and having a very hard time doing so. They're not legitimate.
[02:36:34.400 --> 02:36:39.400]  They go on news and they go, I'm today's news acting like they're Walter Cronkite.
[02:36:39.400 --> 02:36:43.400]  And then they want to say that you are fake news, that I'm fake news.
[02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:46.400]  No, I tell it how I feel and how I see it.
[02:36:46.400 --> 02:36:50.400]  So what they are is their followers, their regurgitators, their repeaters.
[02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:54.400]  Yes, yes, their repeaters is a great work for them.
[02:36:54.400 --> 02:36:58.400]  They repeat everything that they hear from the deep state,
[02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:01.400]  from government operators and controllers, deep state minders.
[02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:06.400]  They don't have a single independent thought of their own.
[02:37:06.400 --> 02:37:10.400]  So, Roger is in the clutches and he's a tough guy,
[02:37:10.400 --> 02:37:14.400]  but with seven charges, we could tabulate up what he's facing,
[02:37:14.400 --> 02:37:17.400]  decades in jail for no Russiagate,
[02:37:17.400 --> 02:37:20.400]  for supposedly lying to Congress when it's very clear he didn't.
[02:37:20.400 --> 02:37:23.400]  He said, yeah, I was talking to Intermediary and WikiLeaks.
[02:37:23.400 --> 02:37:25.400]  I mean, here's the problem. I've said this a thousand times.
[02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:27.400]  Truth doesn't matter to these people. I was there.
[02:37:27.400 --> 02:37:30.400]  Everyone wanted WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks was all cool.
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:33.400]  Assange was cool then. On every major news channel,
[02:37:33.400 --> 02:37:36.400]  he wouldn't talk to us. Stone New Credit Co. and a bunch of others.
[02:37:36.400 --> 02:37:39.400]  He works the media. He was trying to get a hold.
[02:37:39.400 --> 02:37:42.400]  I remember saying, Roger, get Assange or you interview him.
[02:37:42.400 --> 02:37:44.400]  It would be bigger. Find out what's going on.
[02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:46.400]  Well, I hear it's really big. I hear all this.
[02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:48.400]  I was there. He was asking for a job.
[02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:51.400]  And I said, you get me, Julian Assange, exclusive. You've got your job.
[02:37:51.400 --> 02:37:53.400]  And back then, he was a Fox News contributor.
[02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:56.400]  Payed $50,000 a year. He'd want to make a big deal out of that.
[02:37:56.400 --> 02:37:58.400]  They've got hundreds of people in the payroll.
[02:37:58.400 --> 02:38:01.400]  As a contributor, as soon as he worked for us, he lost his job at Fox.
[02:38:01.400 --> 02:38:03.400]  But I was hiring a Fox News contributor.
[02:38:03.400 --> 02:38:07.400]  You know, of course he used to work and write for Lou Dobbs at CNN.
[02:38:07.400 --> 02:38:11.400]  So I'm getting the big wig, anti-globalist guys hired.
[02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:14.400]  They turned that into this criminal thing we're involved in.
[02:38:14.400 --> 02:38:19.400]  And it's just like plastic banana, fake baloney BS world.
[02:38:19.400 --> 02:38:23.400]  But what I'm getting at is we don't take it serious because we know it's not true.
[02:38:23.400 --> 02:38:27.400]  But then it happens and 29 SWAT team people attack the house
[02:38:27.400 --> 02:38:29.400]  to make it look like it's legitimate.
[02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:33.400]  And now Roger's confident now, but my God, next week he gets arraigned.
[02:38:33.400 --> 02:38:35.400]  Like Manafort a year ago, a year and a half ago,
[02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:39.400]  walking into that federal courthouse and never coming out again, man,
[02:38:39.400 --> 02:38:41.400]  except in a damn wheelchair.
[02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:46.400]  So, you know, we're talking here, folks, about real persecution.
[02:38:46.400 --> 02:38:49.400]  And if they, this is a test, like a parrot test of perch,
[02:38:49.400 --> 02:38:52.400]  you know, put its beak on it, see if it can stand on it with weight.
[02:38:52.400 --> 02:38:56.400]  If America fails this test, if Trump and Sarah Huckabee Sanders
[02:38:56.400 --> 02:38:59.400]  fails this test, if they fail this test, we're done.
[02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:01.400]  So I'm a big Trump booster, help get him in.
[02:39:01.400 --> 02:39:02.400]  He's a great guy.
[02:39:02.400 --> 02:39:05.400]  But right now I'm two by four upside the head saying, listen,
[02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:08.400]  get in gear, honcho.
[02:39:08.400 --> 02:39:09.400]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:39:09.400 --> 02:39:12.400]  And when I watch that footage that's being played behind you of the early
[02:39:12.400 --> 02:39:17.400]  morning raid by Robert Mueller, it reminds me of someone in the
[02:39:17.400 --> 02:39:19.400]  control center can pull it up.
[02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:21.400]  Let's pull up some footage of the pogroms.
[02:39:21.400 --> 02:39:23.400]  Let's pull up some footage of this.
[02:39:23.400 --> 02:39:26.400]  Yeah, let's hear the audio.
[02:39:26.400 --> 02:39:27.400]  In fact, you started over.
[02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:29.400]  Let's play the actual audio of them banging on the door.
[02:39:29.400 --> 02:39:35.400]  And thank God he showed up in 30 seconds so they'd have kicked it in.
[02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:41.400]  And seeing in the same group that's in the airports, the bars,
[02:39:41.400 --> 02:39:44.400]  that pays to be on air, there they are.
[02:39:44.400 --> 02:39:46.400]  Yep.
[02:39:46.400 --> 02:39:48.400]  God, talk about any of the people.
[02:39:48.400 --> 02:39:54.400]  And I love how when you show up in a house, like in five seconds,
[02:39:54.400 --> 02:39:56.400]  you're not answering.
[02:39:56.400 --> 02:39:59.400]  I'm coming in and thank God he got down there in 10 seconds,
[02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:01.400]  or they could have had even more.
[02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:04.400]  And it's like, you imagine being those guys that it like with drug cartels
[02:40:04.400 --> 02:40:06.400]  and real criminals and stuff.
[02:40:06.400 --> 02:40:08.400]  They're like going to some dude with no criminal records house.
[02:40:08.400 --> 02:40:11.400]  They've got to play along with this or their FBI bosses will fire him.
[02:40:11.400 --> 02:40:13.400]  And they're like, well, we got to do it.
[02:40:13.400 --> 02:40:14.400]  You know what?
[02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:15.400]  You're not Americans.
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:16.400]  I didn't sell out.
[02:40:16.400 --> 02:40:17.400]  I don't want to hear your crap.
[02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:20.400]  You'll go fight in some foreign country and kill Hadji's all day
[02:40:20.400 --> 02:40:22.400]  because you're told to do it.
[02:40:22.400 --> 02:40:24.400]  But morally, you don't have courage.
[02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:26.400]  A lot of these guys, they're just idiots.
[02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:28.400]  Oh, they're real tough guys.
[02:40:28.400 --> 02:40:30.400]  You go pick on a Trump supporter.
[02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:34.400]  Well, and that's the thing, you know, I think there's a moral and ethical obligation
[02:40:34.400 --> 02:40:38.400]  for anybody who is asked as a member of the FBI SWAT team
[02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:41.400]  and that team that was sent in, you know, if you're a true patriot,
[02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:44.400]  you would have declined to carry out that duty.
[02:40:44.400 --> 02:40:47.400]  I mean, it's clearly a trumped up political charge.
[02:40:47.400 --> 02:40:48.400]  This is a witch hunt.
[02:40:48.400 --> 02:40:52.400]  And what they did is participate and contribute to it.
[02:40:52.400 --> 02:40:57.400]  So they are now collaborators, part of Robert Mueller's political persecution and witch hunt.
[02:40:57.400 --> 02:41:02.400]  And they are no different than he is right now because they are acting as an extension of him.
[02:41:02.400 --> 02:41:06.400]  So I understand they think they're doing their job, but...
[02:41:06.400 --> 02:41:07.400]  Take the arrogance.
[02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:08.400]  They know they could have called.
[02:41:08.400 --> 02:41:09.400]  They would have picked him up.
[02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:11.400]  It was to make him look like a criminal.
[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:14.400]  It's all incredibly transparent.
[02:41:14.400 --> 02:41:15.400]  100%.
[02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:16.400]  100%.
[02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:21.400]  This was a propagandist film project for the FBI.
[02:41:21.400 --> 02:41:22.400]  And who was the director?
[02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:24.400]  Who was the filmmaker?
[02:41:24.400 --> 02:41:27.400]  CNN claims that they got a tip.
[02:41:27.400 --> 02:41:29.400]  CNN claims that they knew to be there somehow.
[02:41:29.400 --> 02:41:34.400]  Why didn't CNN release the source of that tip?
[02:41:34.400 --> 02:41:40.400]  CNN gets producer credit in Roger Stone's SWAT team raid.
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:41.400]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:41:41.400 --> 02:41:42.400]  Absolutely.
[02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:48.400]  I mean, again, this is no different than Joseph Goebbels enlisting filmmakers in the Third
[02:41:48.400 --> 02:41:53.400]  Reich to make propaganda films like Triumph of the Will and The Eternal Jew and all of
[02:41:53.400 --> 02:42:01.400]  these horribly harmful things that helped propagate this idea about Jewish people and the rise
[02:42:01.400 --> 02:42:03.400]  of the Third Reich and Nazism.
[02:42:03.400 --> 02:42:05.400]  Robert Mueller is following the same playbook.
[02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:13.400]  He is using his police state arm and then coordinating with CNN to produce this film production of
[02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:21.400]  force and brutal action against a very peaceful man, Roger Stone, and his wife, who were asleep
[02:42:21.400 --> 02:42:22.400]  with their dogs.
[02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:24.400]  And they could have just picked up the phone.
[02:42:24.400 --> 02:42:25.400]  All right, Jacob Ingalls, stay there.
[02:42:25.400 --> 02:42:27.400]  We're going to get you back on later in the show.
[02:42:27.400 --> 02:42:29.400]  I want to send you an external mic so we have better audio.
[02:42:29.400 --> 02:42:30.400]  But thank you for joining us.
[02:42:30.400 --> 02:42:32.400]  All right, final segment of the show.
[02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:33.400]  Then we have a guest host.
[02:42:33.400 --> 02:42:34.400]  I'll be co-hosting.
[02:42:34.400 --> 02:42:35.400]  Then the War Room.
[02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:36.400]  I'll be co-hosting.
[02:42:36.400 --> 02:42:37.400]  And Roger Stone joins us again.
[02:42:37.400 --> 02:42:39.400]  Jacob Ingalls is welcome to join us again.
[02:42:39.400 --> 02:42:41.400]  Big recaps straight ahead.
[02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:43.400]  This is history happening right now.
[02:42:43.400 --> 02:42:45.400]  And I told you, Roger is in the crosshairs.
[02:42:45.400 --> 02:42:49.400]  Next, David Jones and Alex Jones.
[02:42:49.400 --> 02:43:16.400]  Ha, ha, ha, yes.
[02:43:16.400 --> 02:43:40.960]  Hi, everyone.
[02:43:40.960 --> 02:43:47.600]  answer to a sluggish day. Don't let your day slow you down. Perk Up with TurboForce at infowarstore.com.
[02:43:54.640 --> 02:43:59.120]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the
[02:43:59.120 --> 02:44:04.480]  bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ. It literally
[02:44:05.040 --> 02:44:09.760]  dumbs the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best
[02:44:09.760 --> 02:44:15.760]  iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations. First, seaweed-based iodine that was
[02:44:15.760 --> 02:44:20.160]  pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it. So we
[02:44:20.160 --> 02:44:25.520]  discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought UX2 that's been incredible.
[02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:31.520]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep
[02:44:31.520 --> 02:44:36.720]  earth crystals of nascent iodine. But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research
[02:44:36.720 --> 02:44:43.200]  that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges
[02:44:43.200 --> 02:44:48.960]  it and makes it even more bioavailable. Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it,
[02:44:48.960 --> 02:44:54.320]  you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery. X3, now available at infowarstore.com.
[02:44:57.360 --> 02:45:01.440]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[02:45:02.960 --> 02:45:06.160]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[02:45:06.160 --> 02:45:10.560]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for. The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights,
[02:45:10.560 --> 02:45:16.560]  the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions. They're prohibitions against powerful organizations
[02:45:16.560 --> 02:45:21.840]  and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals. You better understand that
[02:45:21.840 --> 02:45:29.200]  because they're taking them right now. We have seen what they want to do. They called it UN
[02:45:29.200 --> 02:45:35.360]  Agenda 21. Now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda. They want everybody off of the rural lands. They want
[02:45:35.360 --> 02:45:40.560]  people out of the suburbs. They want to pack everybody into the cities because that's where
[02:45:40.560 --> 02:45:47.040]  it is easiest for them to control everyone. It's The David Knight Show. Never missed your show

[02:47:43.680 --> 02:47:47.760]  of the Alex Jones show. And then the war rooms coming up with Owen Shroyer, Roger Stone will be
[02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:52.480]  back on exclusively. I want to open the phones up now. Now we got 20 something phone lines,
[02:47:52.480 --> 02:47:57.680]  we actually have like a hundred, but I see 20 on screen. So to cash 22, I'll get to a lot of
[02:47:57.680 --> 02:48:02.480]  you. I won't get to some of you, but the toll free number to join us today on this Friday.
[02:48:04.080 --> 02:48:16.400]  Global transmission is 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789 Alex. Now let's just sit back and talk
[02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:22.640]  about what's really going on here right now. We've had foreign multinational corporations
[02:48:24.720 --> 02:48:31.120]  take over the United States back to 1921 with the founding of Pratt House in New York City.
[02:48:32.800 --> 02:48:36.640]  The British Empire had learned how to take over countries. It wasn't the British people,
[02:48:37.520 --> 02:48:44.800]  it was the elites they had. And they even funded the first talkies, the first talking movies in
[02:48:44.800 --> 02:48:49.440]  the 20s, where everyone had British accents, even though they weren't British. They called it an
[02:48:49.440 --> 02:48:59.360]  Islamic accent. And they had the OSS form that became the CIA in 47. And so America inherited
[02:48:59.360 --> 02:49:07.200]  the British Empire and the corporate functions it had. And its job was to leverage or
[02:49:07.200 --> 02:49:19.040]  project or parlay that power into taking over China, Indochina, the Middle East, Africa,
[02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:27.840]  Latin America, everything. But the brain of that system was eugenicist set up in England,
[02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:32.720]  the US, and Europe that actually wanted to create a scientific dictatorship to get rid of the family.
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:35.920]  She had the military doctrines, the corporate doctrines, the banking doctrines, but
[02:49:35.920 --> 02:49:46.880]  they only cared about numbers and property. But the cultural brain was leftist, left hand path.
[02:49:47.840 --> 02:49:55.520]  Left hand rise above. And so at the end of the day, they were building the structure of power
[02:49:55.520 --> 02:50:00.400]  where these men just wanted power. But there was a spiritual implement that wanted to couple
[02:50:00.400 --> 02:50:08.880]  above it and have total control. And so that's where we are today on this planet. And that's why
[02:50:08.880 --> 02:50:13.040]  this thing has to be resistant no matter what happens to us individually because it is a child
[02:50:13.040 --> 02:50:18.880]  killing, aborting, planet killing, murdering system that anything it does is destructive.
[02:50:20.320 --> 02:50:23.680]  The left claims they want to protect the planet. They're the very ones with all their projects
[02:50:23.680 --> 02:50:30.400]  and programs killing the planet. Google says ban the word family just this week. This is here.
[02:50:31.040 --> 02:50:36.320]  This is happening. And so they're the globalists killing the nation state. They're the globalists
[02:50:36.320 --> 02:50:40.880]  taking over the countries. They're the globalist bankrupting people. So then they say, oh, Alex
[02:50:40.880 --> 02:50:46.400]  Jones and Donald Trump and Roger Stone, why they galvanized people. They energized the population
[02:50:46.400 --> 02:50:52.320]  to believe in themselves and to believe in self determination. Let's call them Russians.
[02:50:54.160 --> 02:51:00.240]  And now in 2019, in late January, they've made their move.
[02:51:03.120 --> 02:51:09.520]  And people think of things as themselves like, how am I going to do with my bank account? How
[02:51:09.520 --> 02:51:13.920]  am I going to do with the other peer pressure group I'm with on this? That's not what it's about.
[02:51:13.920 --> 02:51:20.320]  The peer pressure groups, the control arms, the systematic systems are
[02:51:20.960 --> 02:51:27.120]  peopled and commanded by a bunch of yes men who then go out and find others who will follow
[02:51:27.120 --> 02:51:37.040]  their orders to carry out the system. And this system is a America, freedom, Christian, family,
[02:51:37.040 --> 02:51:46.800]  free market, capitalist ending thing. So fighting it with every fiber of your body is not some
[02:51:48.640 --> 02:51:53.920]  heroic action. It's like if somebody pushed your head under water to drown you and you fought
[02:51:53.920 --> 02:52:01.120]  to get the surface, that's not heroic. That's called life force. And so the one crime I have,
[02:52:01.120 --> 02:52:08.080]  the one skill I have is I got a hell of a lot of life force and I got a hell of a lot of will
[02:52:09.840 --> 02:52:13.200]  and I'm ready to die. In fact, I'm not just ready to die.
[02:52:17.600 --> 02:52:23.520]  Giving into these globalists is unlimited death. I can feel hell on the other side.
[02:52:23.520 --> 02:52:28.720]  And in fact, I do this out of fear. There's no way to join them and get out of this.
[02:52:28.720 --> 02:52:34.240]  The only thing you can do is resist it. And those of you that have any discernment left,
[02:52:34.240 --> 02:52:37.200]  left, chills up down your spine, you need to go with God right now. You need to understand
[02:52:37.200 --> 02:52:39.920]  you can't beat this by yourself. You need to ask for Jesus Christ right now.
[02:52:40.640 --> 02:52:44.320]  And you need to reach towards God, everything you got. Now, there are those of us
[02:52:46.080 --> 02:52:50.560]  that have to stand in the gap to try to get time for people to wake up and I'm willing to do it.
[02:52:50.560 --> 02:52:55.600]  But let me tell you, it isn't fun with this breather nominee. So I'm gonna tell you right now,
[02:52:55.600 --> 02:53:01.280]  folks, you better decide which side you're on. You better do it forever because there are a lot
[02:53:01.280 --> 02:53:07.600]  of evil people that are on power trips that don't see what they're doing who've turned themselves
[02:53:07.600 --> 02:53:14.720]  over to evil. And if you're intimidated by them, let me assure you, you're not gonna like where you
[02:53:14.720 --> 02:53:21.200]  are as soon as this life ends. The Clintons, the Bushes, the Mollers, the people like this are
[02:53:21.200 --> 02:53:27.520]  our followers and they seek to create a world and culture of followers.
[02:53:29.680 --> 02:53:35.280]  And that's not what humanity is. We're trailblazers, we're leaders. So I'll tell you again,
[02:53:38.640 --> 02:53:43.440]  a lot of social climbers, a lot of cowards are gonna look at me and say,
[02:53:43.440 --> 02:53:50.480]  look at you, you're under attack. Look at you, you're about to be destroyed, you're weak.
[02:53:51.600 --> 02:53:56.720]  And I look at them and I think, God, you poor soul. You don't even see it to you.
[02:53:58.320 --> 02:54:03.680]  As weak as I am, I've got the instinct to struggle like a plant towards the sun towards God
[02:54:04.560 --> 02:54:12.640]  and you guys have given up on that. And as we blast off to the next level, I feel sorry that
[02:54:12.640 --> 02:54:18.160]  a lot of you aren't gonna make it there with us. But those of you who could be black, you could be
[02:54:18.160 --> 02:54:21.200]  white, you could be old, you could be young, you could be Hispanic, you could be Asian,
[02:54:21.760 --> 02:54:27.040]  you could be gay, you could be straight. If you love God and you love justice and you hear what
[02:54:27.040 --> 02:54:33.280]  I'm saying, it means you resonate with God. Doesn't mean you're perfect, none of us are, but
[02:54:33.840 --> 02:54:39.520]  in the final equation, you love justice and you decide on which side you're on. That's why this
[02:54:39.520 --> 02:54:45.360]  is all here. There's not just evil in the world. God made sure that there'd be platforms until the
[02:54:45.360 --> 02:54:52.000]  last minute, the last hour, always saying, we're here for you. We love you. We're inclusive.
[02:54:52.800 --> 02:54:57.760]  Life is inclusive. Don't go with Satan. And if you don't join with that,
[02:54:59.440 --> 02:55:05.280]  then that's your decision. But it's going to become abundantly clear what you face. And
[02:55:05.280 --> 02:55:13.840]  what we're covering here is so important, so big, so intergalactic, so all-seeing, so timeless,
[02:55:13.840 --> 02:55:23.200]  so true, so all-encompassing that it's obscene to say, oh, will you please share the video links,
[02:55:23.200 --> 02:55:28.000]  the audio links? Will you please tell people about the show? Will you buy products to support us
[02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:34.880]  that everything I do is about a win-win like fish oil and multivitamins and water filters,
[02:55:34.880 --> 02:55:43.280]  elf air filters. So they push drugs and DMT and PCP and Prozac and Ritalin and liquor and everything
[02:55:43.280 --> 02:55:47.520]  else. Everything they push is death at you. And I'm just like air filters, water filters,
[02:55:47.520 --> 02:55:53.200]  vitamins, minerals. Everything I do is metaphysically because it's good for me too.
[02:55:53.920 --> 02:55:59.920]  Because that's how I'm charged. It's what I do. I can't cheat. You don't think I don't know the
[02:55:59.920 --> 02:56:04.560]  enemy zone operations, all their maps, all their plans. It's a weakness of mine that I won't
[02:56:04.560 --> 02:56:09.920]  project into it and actually look into what they do. But I do it. I do it when I have to,
[02:56:09.920 --> 02:56:15.120]  and it's not fun. And I'm not complaining. Here's the thing. I'm actually weak.
[02:56:16.800 --> 02:56:22.720]  I really should look into the enemy's mind more. I've promised I would. I've not had the
[02:56:22.720 --> 02:56:28.320]  will to do it lately, but I'm going to try. Maybe tonight. Maybe tonight. It's really horrible,
[02:56:28.320 --> 02:56:35.680]  though. You see what they're doing to kids and everybody. It's not fun. I'll just leave it at
[02:56:35.680 --> 02:56:41.680]  that. But I'll do what has to be done. All I'm telling you is we need your prayers. We need
[02:56:41.680 --> 02:56:48.000]  your support now, not tomorrow, not next week, not next year. This is it. This is the big push
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:51.760]  for the decision on a planetary level, whether we are destroyed as a planet,
[02:56:51.760 --> 02:56:55.920]  or whether we go to the next level, our spirits. God's already going to divide those up from the
[02:56:55.920 --> 02:57:01.360]  good for the bad. But this is an intergalactic quest. It's a great moment to be alive. And I'm
[02:57:01.360 --> 02:57:06.000]  just very blessed and very humbled to be here talking to you. And I just encourage you again.
[02:57:07.200 --> 02:57:11.520]  The power you have when you get excited and you get focused is unlimited.
[02:57:11.520 --> 02:57:16.320]  When you understand the potential you have and when you financially support us going to
[02:57:16.320 --> 02:57:21.440]  inforstore.com, when you get things you already need, it moves mountains. So I'm judging things
[02:57:21.440 --> 02:57:26.560]  right now, whether I stay up with little red or I go on the offense on what you do now at
[02:57:26.560 --> 02:57:31.520]  inforstore.com. But I'll tell you this individually, I'm not going to back down.
[02:57:32.160 --> 02:57:35.360]  Just when things are so dire, it seems weird to plug selling products, but
[02:57:35.360 --> 02:57:52.160]  that's the gas in our tank. If we don't do it, we're dead on the highway. Stay with us. Hour number four.
[02:58:06.320 --> 02:58:09.120]  Focus, clarity and a boost of energy on the go.
[02:58:12.560 --> 02:58:16.400]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water and enjoy.
[02:58:18.080 --> 02:58:21.280]  With 14 servings per box for a two week or more supply,
[02:58:21.280 --> 02:58:24.320]  this is the formula to stock up on whenever you need a boost.
[02:58:26.160 --> 02:58:32.560]  Perfect for work, in the car or at home. Turbo Force is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[02:58:32.560 --> 02:58:37.520]  Don't let your day slow you down. Perk Up with Turbo Force at inforstore.com.
[02:58:46.080 --> 02:58:50.640]  Please, whatever you do realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship and
[02:58:50.640 --> 02:58:54.880]  you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with InfoWars. Yes, some of them are like little
[02:58:54.880 --> 02:58:58.800]  side accounts. They even know we had like InfoWars stores that just showed our products,
[02:58:58.800 --> 02:59:04.000]  but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be in a Trump rally and be mobbed
[02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:08.320]  by all these folks that loved us. Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast
[02:59:08.320 --> 02:59:12.320]  is what brought the country and the world back from the break. But the globalists now want to
[02:59:12.320 --> 02:59:19.200]  target where the resistance came from so that we're not pesky in the future. I want to be troublesome
[02:59:19.200 --> 02:59:25.040]  and pesky. I want to keep going. I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:59:25.040 --> 02:59:30.240]  I want to push all the way. I've committed to do that. I've prayed for that and I've been told
[02:59:30.240 --> 02:59:35.280]  that's going to happen, but you've got a backish and I promise you this. I will never falter.
[02:59:35.280 --> 02:59:40.160]  I will never waver at the spiritual level. I physically will, but I give you my commitment
[02:59:40.160 --> 02:59:56.080]  if you financially support us at foreshore.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[03:00:10.160 --> 03:00:20.320]  Alex Jones. You know, I'm the most anti-suicide person in the world,
[03:00:21.840 --> 03:00:26.240]  but I gotta tell you, I love truth and life so much, I don't give a rat's pee-hime,
[03:00:28.240 --> 03:00:33.280]  I'm telling the truth. I love God, I love justice, and I'm ready to stand up for what's right.
[03:00:34.320 --> 03:00:37.360]  I just wish the average American knew how much danger they were in.
[03:00:37.360 --> 03:00:44.720]  Tom Pappers coming up. Let's listen to this incredible guitar with his synthesizer from 1984,
[03:00:44.720 --> 03:00:46.000]  Van Halen, our way.
[03:00:50.320 --> 03:00:50.800]  It's tough.
[03:00:50.800 --> 03:01:01.040]  You can imagine what your image means. The pages come alive.
[03:01:03.280 --> 03:01:06.560]  Your message free to everyone who reads.
[03:01:06.560 --> 03:01:13.440]  It's put in overdrive. The best part is at the end though. There's that part right at the end
[03:01:13.440 --> 03:01:17.680]  with that guitar with the synthesizer. Not even a synthesizer fan, but the way they
[03:01:17.680 --> 03:01:22.480]  play the two together, it's like Jimi Hendrix. It's like along the watchtower or a few other
[03:01:22.480 --> 03:01:26.720]  songs by Hendrix. It just hits this grind together. The two sounds, it's like...
[03:01:30.560 --> 03:01:37.840]  While everybody else is running around groveling to the system, the cards full of decks,
[03:01:37.840 --> 03:01:42.720]  or the decks are full of cards, somebody has got to say none of the bullies.
[03:01:42.720 --> 03:01:48.480]  What's that part at the end though? We've got another one in the computer that's just
[03:01:48.480 --> 03:01:51.840]  the end of the song. We'll play it when we come back in the next segment.
[03:01:51.840 --> 03:01:56.000]  Tom Pappers manages one of our great TV stations out there in the United States,
[03:01:56.000 --> 03:02:01.360]  out in Kansas, into Missouri, and he's here with us doing a great job at Real
[03:02:02.320 --> 03:02:08.000]  G.E. Trump, Facebook God Emperor Trump official. We can sit back like this is a spectacle,
[03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:13.440]  but it's not really a spectacle, Tom. We are seeing them go after Roger Stone,
[03:02:13.440 --> 03:02:18.160]  former chief advisor to Trump. No Russia, no nothing. He tried to talk to WikiLeaks,
[03:02:18.160 --> 03:02:24.560]  and they think it's like parsing words. You read the indictment. Where is it? He said he
[03:02:24.560 --> 03:02:28.800]  talked to an intermediary. He always said that. So now a journalist talking to someone while
[03:02:28.800 --> 03:02:35.440]  you're going to prison. Well, there are those of us who remembered. Back in 2015, 2016,
[03:02:35.440 --> 03:02:40.880]  WikiLeaks didn't even like Infowars for reasons that still confound me. They gave you guys the
[03:02:40.880 --> 03:02:45.840]  cold shoulder. And so now here we are three years later and Roger Stone, who has been a
[03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:50.800]  wreck. I mean, he's an employee of yours. He's been on Infowars for years now because he might
[03:02:50.800 --> 03:02:56.080]  have known something before the rest of the country at large. That is now a criminal.
[03:02:57.920 --> 03:03:01.840]  Believe me, they, they, they, we were, we hear from the grand jury. Everybody they're like,
[03:03:01.840 --> 03:03:06.800]  he hired a reporter. It's payoff money. And you're just like sitting back like,
[03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:12.400]  it's like so unreal. I don't even get angry at this point. I just say, who are these people?
[03:03:14.240 --> 03:03:18.160]  Well, that's the question. The only thing I can think is, and you talked about this, I've been
[03:03:18.160 --> 03:03:23.600]  listening to the show. They just must be doing anything they can to inspire fear in the president.
[03:03:23.600 --> 03:03:28.640]  WikiLeaks called this pure intimidation in their release and their statement today.
[03:03:28.640 --> 03:03:32.800]  And that's all I can think it is. They're trying to scare you. They don't want you to be passionate.
[03:03:32.800 --> 03:03:37.760]  They want you to be scared. They want Infowars to contract. They want everybody to be on the
[03:03:37.760 --> 03:03:42.400]  defensive. They want the president to be so afraid to do his job because maybe he'll be
[03:03:42.400 --> 03:03:47.040]  indicted next that he's just going to go soft and let them do whatever they want until they can
[03:03:47.040 --> 03:03:51.840]  get one of their guys back in there in a couple years. And it's just sickening that Infowars
[03:03:51.840 --> 03:03:56.800]  and Roger Stone, they're trying to make you guys the sacrificial lamb to the slaughter here.
[03:03:56.800 --> 03:04:01.200]  It's absolutely horrifying. When you wake up this morning, I had 30 texts saying,
[03:04:01.200 --> 03:04:05.280]  are you still being haunted? Infowars just got indicted because people didn't know. Is it Roger
[03:04:05.280 --> 03:04:10.240]  Stone? Is it Alex Jones? They just immediately heard something was going on at Infowars. Then
[03:04:10.240 --> 03:04:17.760]  we find out Roger Stone gets a raid, pre-dawn raid, arrested again over what? You read the
[03:04:17.760 --> 03:04:23.280]  indictment. The whole thing doesn't even make sense. Roger Stone knew something about Party
[03:04:23.280 --> 03:04:28.240]  1 WikiLeaks and he learned it through an intermediary and he was both publicly and
[03:04:28.240 --> 03:04:32.800]  privately telling people that he knew this information and then he tried to give it to the
[03:04:32.800 --> 03:04:39.200]  Trump campaign. So information, this is thought crime is essentially what I get from that indictment.
[03:04:39.200 --> 03:04:43.280]  They're trying to put the man in prison until he dies for the rest of his life. Give him the
[03:04:43.280 --> 03:04:49.440]  Paul Manafort treatment because he knew something. This makes no sense. I don't see how in any type
[03:04:49.440 --> 03:04:56.640]  of rational society this should work. No, you're right. Let's come back. I have the video clip.
[03:04:56.640 --> 03:05:00.880]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key. While coffee, candy,
[03:05:00.880 --> 03:05:05.440]  and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than
[03:05:05.440 --> 03:05:11.600]  ever. Turbo Force from Infowars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins,
[03:05:11.600 --> 03:05:17.280]  amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost
[03:05:17.280 --> 03:05:25.440]  of energy on the go. Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water, and enjoy.

[03:05:55.040 --> 03:06:00.160]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:00.160 --> 03:06:11.600]  So, it's a family show, but back in 2016, October 4th,
[03:06:12.240 --> 03:06:16.080]  we did an overnight show when Assange said he was going to release all this incredible information.
[03:06:18.080 --> 03:06:22.400]  Alex Jones slams Hillary Buttplug Assange for October Surprise Letdown.
[03:06:22.400 --> 03:06:26.640]  So, and in that very show, I say, I've been contacting WikiLeaks,
[03:06:26.640 --> 03:06:34.960]  Roger Stone's been contacting him, he didn't work here yet. Everybody was trying to get Assange on.
[03:06:34.960 --> 03:06:39.280]  He was going on mainstream news. We're like, dude, release it. It's not about who gets it,
[03:06:39.280 --> 03:06:44.240]  it's that Hillary's illegal server showing all her crimes, but now exposing Hillary's crimes
[03:06:44.240 --> 03:06:47.200]  is the big crime. The message is, you go to jail if you do this.
[03:06:49.360 --> 03:06:51.920]  And so... Well, we all... I'm sorry to interrupt you, Alex, but we all remember...
[03:06:51.920 --> 03:06:53.120]  Yeah, go ahead, Tom Papper. Go ahead.
[03:06:53.120 --> 03:06:58.160]  We all remember being up until 3, 4 in the morning watching Infowars because
[03:06:58.160 --> 03:07:03.040]  Julian Assange put out a statement that there was going to be a big scoop delivered in a live
[03:07:03.040 --> 03:07:08.480]  Skype conference that he was going to deliver. We all stay up. We get trolled horribly. I still
[03:07:08.480 --> 03:07:12.560]  laugh about or laugh slash cringe about it because the next day was absolute murder,
[03:07:12.560 --> 03:07:18.160]  but we all stayed up until the break of dawn for Julian Assange to deliver a mumbly off-mic
[03:07:18.160 --> 03:07:23.440]  bad audio book. Well, that's what I'm saying is the government... Well, why don't they know that?
[03:07:23.440 --> 03:07:28.640]  Because they're crooks covering up for Russiagate, which is on Hillary's side. So we were there.
[03:07:28.640 --> 03:07:33.200]  Assange never gave us time of day. So the idea that talking to him's illegal, which he wouldn't
[03:07:33.200 --> 03:07:40.320]  even do, and then Roger lied about it, this is like indicting somebody for tying their shoelaces.
[03:07:41.440 --> 03:07:46.480]  Right. Well, and it makes me remember when CNN, they had the famous idiot on there who said,
[03:07:46.480 --> 03:07:51.600]  you know, only we, CNN, can read the WikiLeaks. It's illegal for you to read the WikiLeaks. At
[03:07:51.600 --> 03:07:56.480]  the time, we're all sitting there laughing about it. How comical that concept is. Maybe they knew
[03:07:56.480 --> 03:08:00.800]  something we didn't because essentially Roger Stone is guilty of reading the WikiLeaks.
[03:08:02.320 --> 03:08:07.760]  Yeah, that's the CNN reporter Cuomo saying, you can't read WikiLeaks. Only we can read WikiLeaks.
[03:08:07.760 --> 03:08:11.920]  And if you read WikiLeaks, you'll go to jail. And I guess three years later, they're serious.
[03:08:11.920 --> 03:08:18.800]  Like, you don't read public documents. Only we can. Right. And again, it all comes down to
[03:08:18.800 --> 03:08:25.760]  Roger Stone heard from a buddy, a radio host, I believe, that they were going to release something.
[03:08:25.760 --> 03:08:28.320]  And so he texts all his friends, Hey, I just heard we're going to really,
[03:08:28.320 --> 03:08:31.520]  they're going to release something over at WikiLeaks. It's exciting stuff. I can't wait to
[03:08:31.520 --> 03:08:36.560]  see what it's going to be like anybody in their right mind. Anybody in media teases it. I remember
[03:08:36.560 --> 03:08:40.880]  like calling Roger going because, well, I know this Randy Kredico. I know some talk shows in New
[03:08:40.880 --> 03:08:44.960]  York, he knows him. It's going to be big. Assange is already saying it. So here's Chris Cuomo,
[03:08:45.600 --> 03:08:50.080]  Mr. Hidden Drive, extravaganza, saying he can look at it, but you can't. Here it is.
[03:08:50.960 --> 03:08:56.480]  That's so interesting. Remember, it's illegal to possess these stolen documents. It's different
[03:08:56.480 --> 03:09:01.520]  for the media. So everything you learn about this, you're learning from us. And in full disclosure,
[03:09:01.520 --> 03:09:06.800]  let's take a look at what is in there and what it means joining us now. So if he legal,
[03:09:06.800 --> 03:09:12.320]  if you look at what Hillary's doing illegally, but I am Lord Cuomo, I can tell you.
[03:09:13.520 --> 03:09:18.400]  And he noticed he said it's different for the media. And of course, CNN and the establishment
[03:09:18.400 --> 03:09:23.280]  gets to decide who is the media. Roger Stone has been working in either politics or media
[03:09:23.280 --> 03:09:29.920]  basically since he was 12 years old. But because CNN determined that he is not media,
[03:09:29.920 --> 03:09:34.080]  he broke the law. He wasn't allowed to tease this information. He wasn't allowed to know
[03:09:34.080 --> 03:09:38.480]  anything about it. Info wars as a whole should have just ignored the WikiLeaks because you
[03:09:38.480 --> 03:09:44.400]  don't have your super secret CNN license to be a media. So therefore you should have just ignored
[03:09:44.400 --> 03:09:48.320]  the WikiLeaks. You should have just quoted CNN articles and that's all we would know about it.
[03:09:48.320 --> 03:09:53.360]  We wouldn't know about all of the disturbing content that we won't even bring up for. I'm
[03:09:53.360 --> 03:09:56.480]  guessing you guys would get another lawsuit on your desk. I don't want to cause that,
[03:09:56.480 --> 03:10:01.440]  but all the disturbing content from those WikiLeaks, all of the New York Times admitting
[03:10:01.440 --> 03:10:05.920]  that they are hacks, the Politico reporters admitting, since I am a hack now, I will send
[03:10:05.920 --> 03:10:10.800]  my articles to you from now on so you can review them. They just expect that we should have sat
[03:10:10.800 --> 03:10:16.160]  down, ignored all of it. And because we didn't, that apparently gives them the opportunity to
[03:10:16.160 --> 03:10:22.560]  arrest Roger Stone in the most ridiculous way possible. I just hope that enough Americans
[03:10:22.560 --> 03:10:27.040]  watch this. And then they read the CNN article where they're trying desperately to connect it
[03:10:27.040 --> 03:10:32.000]  to Russia, like a crazy person, trying to connect the dots that don't exist. Cause obviously the
[03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:36.320]  the indictment. Let me ask you this. We can argue how it's not Russia all day. Everybody knows that
[03:10:36.320 --> 03:10:40.240]  unless it's Mueller giving the uranium to Russians or Hillary getting money from uranium,
[03:10:40.240 --> 03:10:45.120]  there's a Russia connection. Where do they go now? What's the calculus of Mueller in them
[03:10:45.120 --> 03:10:50.880]  to go ahead and go after Stone and do all of this and then have the media boo him so he
[03:10:50.880 --> 03:10:55.040]  doesn't have speeches, press conference pointing out, we have the exclusives now, the video
[03:10:55.040 --> 03:11:00.160]  from the first hour of the second hour posted to info wars.com. So you hear what Roger Stone said.
[03:11:00.160 --> 03:11:04.320]  So how critical is that for listeners to go, wow, this is like here, what the man they're
[03:11:04.320 --> 03:11:09.840]  indicted has to say. The media won't let you hear what Roger has to say. The media tried to boo him
[03:11:09.840 --> 03:11:15.680]  and shut down the media shut down Roger Stone's press conference. So he gave one to info wars,
[03:11:15.680 --> 03:11:19.760]  find out what he said. That's it. The exclusive interview with info wars, Roger Stone,
[03:11:19.760 --> 03:11:24.560]  after arrest. It's all up there on the site. Imagine they don't want him to have a voice.
[03:11:24.560 --> 03:11:30.720]  How un-American is that? How dangerous is that? Well, it just goes to show these guys are total
[03:11:30.720 --> 03:11:35.440]  morons because it's going to backfire. It got you guys tons of traffic. I'm sure you had a DDoS
[03:11:35.440 --> 03:11:40.000]  attack. You had your streams go down because of that and just the people trying to watch the show
[03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:45.360]  and see what Roger had to say. And if the media had any type of brain in their head at all,
[03:11:45.360 --> 03:11:50.560]  they would have shushed all their booing reporters down and let Roger speak there before the cameras
[03:11:50.560 --> 03:11:54.560]  so they could get the ratings. But instead it's driving more and more people to info wars. And
[03:11:54.560 --> 03:11:59.600]  I have a sneaking suspicion. Roger has been saying he fears he's going to be indicted for
[03:11:59.600 --> 03:12:04.240]  months now. And I think they were waiting for an opportune moment. If you look at the last seven,
[03:12:04.240 --> 03:12:09.680]  eight days, this has been possibly the worst week and a half for the media in recent memory,
[03:12:09.680 --> 03:12:14.320]  probably since Kavanaugh. First, it started with the Buzzfeed fiasco where the deep state
[03:12:14.320 --> 03:12:19.440]  shill Robert Mueller himself had to come out and say, no, this is fake news. It does not
[03:12:19.440 --> 03:12:24.960]  correspond to our findings. Ignore it. Then the very next day we get the Covington situation
[03:12:24.960 --> 03:12:31.200]  where they're trying to frame a group of teenagers as vile racist anti semites and that blew up in
[03:12:31.200 --> 03:12:35.280]  their face. So it's just been thing after thing after thing. They realized this Covington thing
[03:12:35.280 --> 03:12:40.800]  wasn't going away. So they thought, what can we do? Well, let's see. Let's just get Roger Stone.
[03:12:40.800 --> 03:12:44.960]  He's a former Trump advisor. He works at info wars. There's an Alex Jones connection. There's a
[03:12:44.960 --> 03:12:49.840]  Trump connection. He will be our distraction. And I think it's working. Now this is all anybody
[03:12:49.840 --> 03:12:54.480]  is going to talk about that and President Trump kicking the wall can down the road for another
[03:12:54.480 --> 03:13:00.480]  three weeks. And all of this is again, thanks, Roger. You're a great distraction. So they will
[03:13:00.480 --> 03:13:05.920]  no longer focus on the Democrat party's own incompetence and the media's frank dishonesty.
[03:13:06.640 --> 03:13:11.040]  No, I think you're right. By the way, we found the clip from October, 2016,
[03:13:11.040 --> 03:13:15.520]  where I'm yelling at Assange for not releasing stuff. And then we're supposedly all in a master
[03:13:15.520 --> 03:13:23.680]  mind operation together, which is total BS here at us. Sange trolling the world is Hillary's
[03:13:23.680 --> 03:13:28.800]  October surprise. Come on, Assange. Julian Assange is a Hillary butt plug.
[03:13:31.760 --> 03:13:36.080]  Legal counsel. I think we have the title for tonight's news.
[03:13:36.080 --> 03:13:43.680]  And so I go on from there, but the idea that we're coordinating with him, I was there. It's
[03:13:43.680 --> 03:13:48.720]  like you make you like we laugh about this. It's not funny. Roger's been indicted. He's been swat
[03:13:48.720 --> 03:13:54.080]  teamed at his house, 29 armed people pointing guns at him. And then Mueller is on tarmacs giving
[03:13:54.080 --> 03:14:00.000]  uranium to the Russians and Hillary gets $130 million for it. It's just like, it's a sick joke,
[03:14:00.000 --> 03:14:05.040]  man. Well, and this reminds me of Hillary Clinton. You know, the only reason why she's not facing
[03:14:05.040 --> 03:14:10.960]  criminal charges is because Comey came up with a totally fictitious concept called intent.
[03:14:10.960 --> 03:14:16.480]  You see, yeah, she did some bad things, but she didn't mean to. So where is that with Roger Stone?
[03:14:16.480 --> 03:14:21.280]  I don't think Roger Stone meant to do anything wrong. Does that mean that we should totally
[03:14:21.280 --> 03:14:26.080]  disregard all of this because he had good intentions? So it goes, I hope that Americans
[03:14:26.080 --> 03:14:31.040]  are seeing this glaring double standard. Hillary Clinton gets to walk free. Comey gets to walk
[03:14:31.040 --> 03:14:36.000]  free. They all lied. It came out. Now, I guess Comey, they're still a little bit better than Congress.
[03:14:36.000 --> 03:14:40.160]  Exactly. You're going to take over for the next 45 minutes. And then Owen Shroyer,
[03:14:40.160 --> 03:14:44.160]  Roger Stone is going to be back, global exclusive. He won't be boot off the air here.
[03:14:44.160 --> 03:14:49.920]  You'll actually get to hear what he has to say coming up at three o'clock central standard time
[03:14:49.920 --> 03:14:56.640]  in just about 45 minutes. Owen Shroyer takes over. We have Tom Papert again at Real G.E. Trump and

[03:18:58.960 --> 03:19:04.640]  run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk. Believe me, I know. I spend hours in
[03:19:04.640 --> 03:19:09.520]  front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day. But thanks to Supermail

[03:19:52.640 --> 03:20:10.720]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:22.640 --> 03:20:27.840]  Let's get back to the fourth hour of The Alex Jones Show. I am Tom Pappert, your guest host for
[03:20:27.840 --> 03:20:34.560]  this hour, filling in for Alex Jones on today, an absolutely insane day. Roger Stone, rated at his
[03:20:34.560 --> 03:20:41.680]  Florida home, arrested out on a $250,000 bond for what are essentially process crimes relating to
[03:20:41.680 --> 03:20:46.560]  statements that he may have given to Congress that may have been incorrect. It is frankly
[03:20:46.560 --> 03:20:51.280]  startling to see this happening in America. And I think the timing says it all. But before Alex
[03:20:51.280 --> 03:20:56.720]  had to step out, we were just talking about WikiLeaks and their statement on this. And WikiLeaks,
[03:20:56.720 --> 03:21:02.480]  of course, as I made the case, they've never really been a big fan or proponent of Infowars.
[03:21:02.480 --> 03:21:07.760]  Yes, Infowars reported on their leaks, as did literally everyone else in the media. If you were
[03:21:07.760 --> 03:21:13.200]  a journalist to ignore the WikiLeaks back in 2016, when it was all coming out almost weekly,
[03:21:13.200 --> 03:21:16.560]  you would have been a hack. You would have been a terrible journalist. You would have been fired
[03:21:16.560 --> 03:21:22.080]  from your job. And Infowars did their responsible thing by putting it out. But this is the official
[03:21:22.080 --> 03:21:28.480]  statement from WikiLeaks United States lawyer. They said the military style, don arrest of Mr.
[03:21:28.480 --> 03:21:35.200]  Stone, a 66 year old political consultant, was wholly unnecessary and performed and served no
[03:21:35.200 --> 03:21:42.400]  purpose other than intimidation. The charges against Stone do not allege that Stone lied about
[03:21:42.400 --> 03:21:48.080]  his lack of contacts with Julian Assange, but rather about his contacts with others and documents
[03:21:48.080 --> 03:21:54.480]  reflecting those communications. So again, you have WikiLeaks doubling, tripling down on this idea.
[03:21:54.480 --> 03:22:00.880]  They are not Infowars fans. They are not working with Alex Jones or Infowars or Roger Stone.
[03:22:00.880 --> 03:22:05.280]  And if you look at Julian Assange's politics, that might have something to do with it. He
[03:22:05.280 --> 03:22:11.120]  leans a little bit closer to Bernie Sanders and Alexandria occasional cortex than he does the
[03:22:11.120 --> 03:22:17.520]  Liberty libertarian conservative, paleo conservative, Alex Jones. That could have something to do with
[03:22:17.520 --> 03:22:23.280]  it. But it is absolutely stunning to see the media, which Julian Assange was their favorite
[03:22:23.280 --> 03:22:27.920]  person in the world. When he was exposing the war crimes of George W. Bush, when he was putting
[03:22:27.920 --> 03:22:34.480]  out leaks that hurt Republicans, they loved him. He would go on CNN. He would go on MSNBC. He was
[03:22:34.480 --> 03:22:40.960]  the darling. And then Hillary Clinton lost. And now we have to do anything we can to frame it
[03:22:40.960 --> 03:22:46.560]  all about Russia. Turn Julian Assange into enemy number one, Alex Jones into enemy number two,
[03:22:46.560 --> 03:22:53.520]  Roger Stone into enemy number three. And that is where we are left today. A man who is 66 years
[03:22:53.520 --> 03:22:59.680]  old dedicated his entire life to this country to trying to restore it to what he knew as a child.
[03:22:59.680 --> 03:23:05.840]  He was a Goldwater fan. He was a Reagan fan. He was a Trump fan. He has to go. And there's a lot
[03:23:05.840 --> 03:23:12.400]  of fears that he's going to be getting the Paul Manafort treatment, where he will go into a federal
[03:23:12.400 --> 03:23:17.760]  facility and he will never be seen again. Now, of course, Roger Stone, fortunately, is from what,
[03:23:17.760 --> 03:23:23.280]  as he likes to refer to it as, the old school. He's promised numerous times that regardless of
[03:23:23.280 --> 03:23:29.200]  the lies, the charges, the lawyer fees, he is not going to flip on the president. And I think he's
[03:23:29.200 --> 03:23:35.040]  a man of his word when it comes to this. I think Roger Stone has a bit more of a spine than that
[03:23:35.040 --> 03:23:39.840]  crooked lawyer. We won't even dignify him by saying his name. And for its part, I will say the
[03:23:39.840 --> 03:23:45.440]  administration is doing a bit more than they might have. You had Sarah Sanders come out and say,
[03:23:45.440 --> 03:23:51.360]  does this same standard apply to Hillary Clinton, where Roger Stone may or may not have broken a
[03:23:51.360 --> 03:23:56.320]  law by lying by omission, essentially, is what they're saying. They're saying that he lied to
[03:23:56.320 --> 03:24:00.720]  Congress. Therefore, he has to die in prison. Of course, as I mentioned in the last segment with
[03:24:00.720 --> 03:24:06.080]  Alex, Hillary Clinton, the only reason why she's not facing criminal charges is because you had
[03:24:06.080 --> 03:24:12.400]  Comey come up with this fantastic concept called intent. So you see, if you rob a bank, but you
[03:24:12.400 --> 03:24:18.560]  didn't have malicious intent, then you're okay, right? No, no, that is a concept that is a legal
[03:24:18.560 --> 03:24:24.720]  fabrication that only exists for Democrats named Hillary Clinton. It does not exist for Paul
[03:24:24.720 --> 03:24:31.200]  Manafort. It does not exist for Roger Stone. And then of course, President Trump did tweet out
[03:24:31.200 --> 03:24:36.960]  early this morning, this is the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country. No collusion.
[03:24:36.960 --> 03:24:42.720]  Border coyotes, drug dealers and human traffickers are treated better. Absolutely true. Where's
[03:24:42.720 --> 03:24:48.960]  Rogers catch and release? Who alerted CNN to be there? The president concluded on Twitter.
[03:24:48.960 --> 03:24:55.120]  And there is something to be said. I think tweeting is a little too little too late when
[03:24:55.120 --> 03:25:00.160]  it comes to this stage of the game. You have longtime associates of President Trump.
[03:25:00.160 --> 03:25:04.560]  Roger Stone has known him since at least the 1980s. Maybe earlier, we don't know.
[03:25:05.520 --> 03:25:12.880]  Long time associates of President Trump being hauled away in the pre-dawn light, CNN celebrating,
[03:25:12.880 --> 03:25:17.840]  figuratively dancing on his grave already. And the president did put out a tweet.
[03:25:17.840 --> 03:25:24.000]  But then that seems to be about it, which is disappointing. So we're going to keep talking
[03:25:24.000 --> 03:25:26.960]  about this for the rest of the segment. Next segment, we're going to be taking your calls.
[03:25:26.960 --> 03:25:30.560]  We've got Thomas in Texas, Freddie in California. People have been holding for 40 minutes,
[03:25:30.560 --> 03:25:34.880]  so we've got to try to get some of these people in. I feel bad. But I do want to remind everybody
[03:25:34.880 --> 03:25:40.720]  that Alex needs support right now. I can only imagine how crushing these legal bills are going
[03:25:40.720 --> 03:25:48.080]  to be. Obviously, Roger Stone does too. StoneDefenseFund.com to support Roger Stone. Get a Roger Stone,
[03:25:48.080 --> 03:25:54.400]  the small pebble that is an exact replica of the one David used to defeat Goliath. And I think right
[03:25:54.400 --> 03:26:00.400]  now that is perhaps more accurate of a synopsis of what's happening here than it ever has been.
[03:26:00.400 --> 03:26:06.560]  You have Roger Stone. Again, political consultant, media figure. Everybody loves this guy. CNN used
[03:26:06.560 --> 03:26:13.200]  to love to have him on because he was an entertaining guest. And now he is going up against the true
[03:26:13.200 --> 03:26:20.080]  Goliath. He's going up against Robert Mueller, possibly the most powerful man in this country.
[03:26:20.080 --> 03:26:25.120]  Mueller has the power to do anything he wants. He's completely unchecked. President Trump's
[03:26:25.120 --> 03:26:31.200]  new Department of Justice is not going to rein him in. He's already come out publicly and said,
[03:26:31.200 --> 03:26:36.400]  no, I love Mueller. Our wives used to go knit together. We're best friends. I consider Mueller a
[03:26:36.400 --> 03:26:45.280]  brother practically. So we have this unelected person who many feel he was a little heartbroken,
[03:26:45.280 --> 03:26:50.000]  let's say, felt a little burned by President Trump when he didn't give him Comey's old job.
[03:26:50.000 --> 03:26:54.320]  And so he's turned his life into destroying the president, destroying the prosperity of this
[03:26:54.320 --> 03:26:59.920]  country and destroying anybody related to the president. And if you go back to 2015 and 2016,
[03:26:59.920 --> 03:27:05.520]  when Roger first started appearing on the Alex Jones show, this man has put in the serious
[03:27:05.520 --> 03:27:09.440]  hours here. And this is something that I think a lot of conservatives are starting to feel.
[03:27:10.240 --> 03:27:16.320]  We've dedicated our lives to making the country great again. We've dedicated our lives to helping
[03:27:16.320 --> 03:27:22.560]  the president, to getting him elected, to putting his message out there. And we, in return, are a
[03:27:22.560 --> 03:27:27.840]  lot of us financially worse off than we were three years ago. It's great to see the country at large
[03:27:27.840 --> 03:27:35.200]  do better. But it's not so great to see Alex Jones, one of the driving engines behind this movement,
[03:27:35.760 --> 03:27:40.960]  be sacrificed. First it was social media, then they came after his finances, attacking his
[03:27:40.960 --> 03:27:46.480]  payment processors and everything else. Now they're arresting his employees. And again,
[03:27:46.480 --> 03:27:51.360]  the Jerome Corsi thing where they just paid off his contract, which is fairly standard in this
[03:27:51.360 --> 03:27:56.880]  industry, I can tell you. Now they're saying that was hush money. They delivered a giant cash payment
[03:27:56.880 --> 03:28:02.000]  to Jerome Corsi to try to prevent him from communicating with Bob Mueller and throwing
[03:28:02.000 --> 03:28:09.520]  stone and Jones under the bus. It's all really reaching some kind of apex here. We're going to,
[03:28:09.520 --> 03:28:14.480]  I've never before heard of this country being so divided, so built on fake news.
[03:28:15.280 --> 03:28:19.040]  I don't know where it's coming, but I do know that Infowars is going to need your financial
[03:28:19.040 --> 03:28:24.240]  support. Again, it's infowarstore.com. I am a big proponent of all of the supplements. If you
[03:28:24.240 --> 03:28:30.880]  remember me coming on last summer in August, I was a big guy back then, much smaller now. And I
[03:28:30.880 --> 03:28:36.320]  owe a lot of that, no small part to the supplements provided at infowarstore.com. Supermail vitality,

[03:31:18.960 --> 03:31:23.520]  where this goes. But yeah, God's got a big war for you ready. And so if you can't face George
[03:31:23.520 --> 03:31:28.160]  Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face

[03:32:52.560 --> 03:32:59.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:32:59.120 --> 03:33:23.600]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news. Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:23.600 --> 03:33:32.080]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I am Tom Pappert, Facebook's God Emperor Trump,
[03:33:32.080 --> 03:33:36.000]  guest hosting this fourth hour. We're going to be taking your calls here in a few minutes.
[03:33:36.000 --> 03:33:43.040]  Lots of people have been holding for coming up on 45 minutes now, but I was just rereading CNN's
[03:33:43.040 --> 03:33:48.480]  basic misunderstanding of today's events and it's stunning. This is the title of
[03:33:48.480 --> 03:33:55.760]  CNN's take on events. Why Roger Stone's stunning indictment is a huge moment in the Russia probe.
[03:33:55.760 --> 03:34:00.080]  And again, anybody who actually took the time to read this crazy indictment knows it has
[03:34:00.080 --> 03:34:04.720]  absolutely nothing to do with Russia. The whole concept that it has anything to do with Russia
[03:34:04.720 --> 03:34:09.760]  is beyond me. It has to do with speaking to Congress and did he know about WikiLeaks.
[03:34:09.760 --> 03:34:14.240]  And so I guess maybe CNN is trying to make the argument that WikiLeaks is a Russian agent,
[03:34:14.240 --> 03:34:20.160]  which is totally unproven, totally unprovable. But if you sit here and you look at this, they go
[03:34:20.160 --> 03:34:27.440]  back to Trump joking at a rally saying, I think if the Russians could find those 30,000 missing
[03:34:27.440 --> 03:34:33.840]  emails, they would be mightily rewarded. And so what this essentially comes down to is they're
[03:34:33.840 --> 03:34:40.000]  alleging that President Trump, then candidate Trump, colluded with the media to get the inside
[03:34:40.000 --> 03:34:45.920]  scoop on a story before anyone else had it. I think that's possibly the simplest thing to put
[03:34:45.920 --> 03:34:51.840]  this up to, to condense this down to. But we know from the very WikiLeaks that this controversy
[03:34:51.840 --> 03:34:59.760]  is about, Hillary Clinton did exactly that. She had a Politico reporter in her email saying,
[03:34:59.760 --> 03:35:07.280]  because I am now a hack, I will deliver all my stories to the Clinton campaign to be proofread
[03:35:07.280 --> 03:35:12.640]  before I go public with them. That's Politico. The guy was later fired from Politico, got a job
[03:35:12.640 --> 03:35:19.200]  at the New York Times. This is mainstream media colluding with the Clinton campaign 10 times
[03:35:19.200 --> 03:35:25.520]  worse than what Roger allegedly did. But of course, that doesn't matter because they have
[03:35:25.520 --> 03:35:30.240]  Democrat privilege. So let's start taking some of your calls. First, we have Thomas in Texas.
[03:35:30.240 --> 03:35:37.280]  And it's not just because I love your name. Hey, how's it going? Thomas, welcome to the show. Hey,
[03:35:37.280 --> 03:35:44.160]  thanks for having me. My opinion is not going to be very popular, but I've worried since the day
[03:35:44.160 --> 03:35:49.280]  Roger Stone got on Alex's show that he was sent to Alex because Alex is the real target.
[03:35:51.680 --> 03:35:56.080]  Well, and see, I get where you're coming from because we all have to worry about these bad
[03:35:56.080 --> 03:36:00.960]  agents in our midst, right? I mean, that is a very real fear. But if you look at Roger Stone's
[03:36:00.960 --> 03:36:07.760]  track record worked with Trump since 1987, at least helped Trump plan his exploratory committee
[03:36:07.760 --> 03:36:16.640]  to run for president in 2000. It was instrumental in getting him to actually run in 2015 on June 16th
[03:36:16.640 --> 03:36:21.600]  when he announced. So I had met Roger twice now, once in person, we just happened to bump into each
[03:36:21.600 --> 03:36:25.600]  other on the street in Cleveland during the Republican National Convention. And then once last
[03:36:25.600 --> 03:36:31.040]  summer when I was co-hosting with Alex Jones there in Austin, Texas, I can assure everybody at home
[03:36:31.040 --> 03:36:36.560]  who is wondering, how is this happening? How does this keep happening to people who Alex Jones knows?
[03:36:37.680 --> 03:36:44.160]  Roger is the real deal. But I definitely think they're trying to go down and find anybody they
[03:36:44.160 --> 03:36:50.320]  can close to Alex because they want to make Alex fearful. They want to make his operation
[03:36:50.320 --> 03:36:54.400]  contract. And again, that's why everybody needs to look past all of this ridiculousness,
[03:36:54.400 --> 03:37:00.640]  all of the fake news, all of the allegations, all of the lies and keep going to infowarsstore.com.
[03:37:00.640 --> 03:37:03.920]  Thomas, did I get, did I answer or kind of respond to you correctly?
[03:37:04.640 --> 03:37:10.000]  Well, the reason I suggest that is Alex is so powerful. He's the reason I got involved in politics
[03:37:10.000 --> 03:37:16.000]  and I made waves just in my local community all the way up to national. And I think they know
[03:37:16.000 --> 03:37:21.520]  that he has a grip on America as far as letting us kind of beating us over the head to wake us up
[03:37:21.520 --> 03:37:25.760]  to what they're really doing. And, and they want to shut him down by any means necessary. That's why
[03:37:26.400 --> 03:37:30.400]  I have always suspected that Roger was sent to him. Roger's been in politics since the 60s.
[03:37:30.960 --> 03:37:34.800]  So he knows how to manipulate and, and I don't know, I've just never trusted him.
[03:37:34.800 --> 03:37:37.760]  And I think the whole dog and pony show was more for Alex.
[03:37:39.360 --> 03:37:43.440]  Well, I definitely think that they're going to Roger. They're trying to take him out to get to
[03:37:43.440 --> 03:37:48.720]  Alex. But if you look at Roger's track record, it's not like he was supporting George Herbert
[03:37:48.720 --> 03:37:53.760]  Walker Bush. You know, he was a Goldwater guy. He was a Reagan guy. When the, when the party
[03:37:53.760 --> 03:37:59.440]  betrayed him, he moved to the Libertarian Party only came back to the Republican Party when the
[03:37:59.440 --> 03:38:05.440]  hostile takeover by one president, Donald Trump was completed. But thank you so much for that,
[03:38:06.000 --> 03:38:10.320]  Thomas. I know it's a big fear out there. I fear about it. And I'm nowhere near the public figure,
[03:38:10.320 --> 03:38:17.520]  Alex is, because they absolutely will try to put moles in your operation to destroy it. And I think
[03:38:17.520 --> 03:38:22.160]  if there's been anybody, I'm not going to drop names, but his name was dropped on this episode.
[03:38:22.160 --> 03:38:29.360]  I think we know who the real bad agent would have been. He's currently obsessed with Q, I think.
[03:38:29.360 --> 03:38:33.840]  Let's go to Freddie in California. Freddie, thank you so much for calling into the Alex Jones show.
[03:38:33.840 --> 03:38:38.800]  I'm Tom Pepper. Let's, what do you have to say? Hey, Tom, what's up, man? Yeah.
[03:38:40.080 --> 03:38:47.120]  This whole thing with Roger Stone, it almost has the same effect to me personally as a Trump
[03:38:47.120 --> 03:38:50.880]  supporter, especially in California, Southern California, you know how they are out here.
[03:38:50.880 --> 03:38:57.760]  You're a brave man out there. Yeah. It almost has the same effect as Mike Flynn. When Mike Flynn,
[03:38:57.760 --> 03:39:03.200]  when they got Mike Flynn, I was like, what the heck is going on? But two points I want to make.
[03:39:03.200 --> 03:39:09.360]  Sarah Huckabee Sanders' comment this morning, I think was a slap to the face to Trump supporters,
[03:39:09.360 --> 03:39:14.000]  just my personal opinion. I mean, anytime we see a Trump supporter's slap, kick,
[03:39:14.000 --> 03:39:22.400]  beat, and threaten, her response should be played as just throwing the entire 63 plus
[03:39:22.400 --> 03:39:28.080]  million Trump supporters under the bus. I didn't like it. I thought it was tacky. And if I was
[03:39:30.240 --> 03:39:37.120]  put a fire at her, but see, that's the point. I want President Trump. I want to ready your phone's
[03:39:37.120 --> 03:39:41.360]  going to break up a little bit. I don't know if you might be in a wind tunnel or something like
[03:39:41.360 --> 03:39:46.240]  that. But I do know what you mean. I feel like, and I think a lot of people do at this point,
[03:39:46.240 --> 03:39:50.720]  I am an emphatic supporter of President Trump. I think he's done amazing things. The Supreme
[03:39:50.720 --> 03:39:56.640]  Court alone is going to keep this country going for another 20, 25 years. But it feels like sometimes
[03:39:56.640 --> 03:40:01.760]  we're out there giving our financial security away. We're giving away our physical security
[03:40:01.760 --> 03:40:06.320]  away. You mentioned California. We all know what goes on in Berkeley and elsewhere. If you
[03:40:06.320 --> 03:40:11.360]  wear a Trump hat in that state, you might as well be wearing a white hood. And I'm not just getting
[03:40:11.360 --> 03:40:16.000]  that idea out of nowhere, as we all know from the Covington fiasco last week or this week even.
[03:40:16.800 --> 03:40:21.600]  But it does feel like sometimes we're all putting our necks on the lines. We want the
[03:40:21.600 --> 03:40:25.600]  administration to do so as well. And I think we need to remember what Trump gave up. He had a
[03:40:25.600 --> 03:40:31.280]  pretty sweet life. He's given up all of that. He's given up his family security. They're trying
[03:40:31.280 --> 03:40:37.200]  to drag his business, his children, his grandchildren's names through the mud. Look at all the hip pieces
[03:40:37.200 --> 03:40:42.000]  on Baron Trump. So perhaps maybe that, that's what I tell myself when I think we've given all
[03:40:42.000 --> 03:40:46.560]  this collectively as supporters. But I do know where you're coming from. I'm looking for the
[03:40:46.560 --> 03:40:54.000]  administration to do something that is real, that we can see, that is tangible. Come out and say,
[03:40:54.000 --> 03:40:58.160]  why on earth are you persecuting people that I've worked with for 40 years? This is obviously
[03:40:58.160 --> 03:41:02.480]  an attempt to get to me. That's what I want the president to say. And I hope he doesn't do it on
[03:41:02.480 --> 03:41:09.360]  Twitter. But what's your second point, Freddie? The second point is I thought Trump coming out
[03:41:09.360 --> 03:41:14.720]  and getting the economy going. Look, we all survived under the Obama economy. So we were
[03:41:14.720 --> 03:41:20.720]  doing great. So my thought was, okay, Trump's going to come get the economy piping hot so that
[03:41:20.720 --> 03:41:26.640]  when he does pull the trigger on the deep state, it wouldn't be such a hard crash. But I'm just
[03:41:26.640 --> 03:41:31.200]  waiting for him to act on the deep state. I don't know what your thoughts about that.
[03:41:32.560 --> 03:41:36.800]  I definitely know where you're coming from. And we have seen now numerous times whenever
[03:41:36.800 --> 03:41:41.760]  President Trump, maybe he starts to walk up to that line, we will see them hike up the interest
[03:41:41.760 --> 03:41:47.120]  rates at the Fed and the stock market goes down. And everybody's talking about the second great
[03:41:47.120 --> 03:41:52.400]  recession or even the second great depression. So they're absolutely plotting and planning with
[03:41:52.400 --> 03:41:55.840]  everything they've got in their arsenal. But Freddie, I definitely don't think you're alone here.
[03:41:55.840 --> 03:42:00.160]  There's a lot of people out there who are looking to see President Trump, you know, the first year
[03:42:00.160 --> 03:42:05.200]  he admitted everybody knew he was going to focus on the economy on doing the stuff that
[03:42:05.200 --> 03:42:11.120]  essentially any Republican president would have done. The second year it came out, I think it was
[03:42:11.120 --> 03:42:16.720]  leaked through Bannon allegedly, which, you know, he has his own swamp monsters around him. But it
[03:42:16.720 --> 03:42:21.520]  was leaked through Bannon that the second year President Trump intended to focus on trade.
[03:42:21.520 --> 03:42:25.920]  And boy, did he did a great job. He's bullied China to the point where they're no longer going to
[03:42:25.920 --> 03:42:31.520]  have the Chinese millennium. They're escalating their totalitarianism in a desperate bid to keep
[03:42:31.520 --> 03:42:37.760]  control. North Korea has been brought to heal all across the world. We see NAFTA renegotiated,
[03:42:37.760 --> 03:42:43.040]  even though it has some flaws. We see all kinds of great things happening from President Trump's
[03:42:43.040 --> 03:42:48.480]  focus on trade last year, this year, or maybe next year. But I think that's too late. This
[03:42:48.480 --> 03:42:52.720]  year, the focus needs to be on exposing and defeating these deep state.
[03:42:55.600 --> 03:42:59.760]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key. While coffee, candy,
[03:42:59.760 --> 03:43:04.320]  and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than

[03:45:53.520 --> 03:45:57.520]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[03:45:57.520 --> 03:46:03.120]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives,
[03:46:03.120 --> 03:46:07.760]  the corrupt justice department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate. People say,
[03:46:07.760 --> 03:46:11.760]  why would you start a fight with them? Because they were already dominating and running America
[03:46:11.760 --> 03:46:16.720]  into the ground, and I knew we had no future if we didn't do this. So we've already had incredible
[03:46:16.720 --> 03:46:22.720]  success, but if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is
[03:46:22.720 --> 03:46:27.680]  and why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, and if you spread
[03:46:27.680 --> 03:46:33.920]  the word about our articles and videos, infowars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these
[03:46:33.920 --> 03:46:39.760]  brutal scumbags, we'll win. We have huge sales at infowarsstore.com right now, and we're still able
[03:46:39.760 --> 03:46:43.600]  to operate the shop and garden, get stuff shipped out to you despite the fact we're trying to block
[03:46:43.600 --> 03:46:48.480]  our commerce, and you're right to the market. But if you don't stand up and support us financially,
[03:46:48.480 --> 03:46:53.120]  Soros the Global will swing with. This is InfoWars Darker Tower. Weed your support. I'm counting on you.
[03:46:53.120 --> 03:47:14.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:23.680 --> 03:47:29.040]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. This is the fourth hour. I am your guest host,
[03:47:29.040 --> 03:47:34.240]  Tom Pappert, and we are winding down the show here. Make sure to tune in to War Room. Coming
[03:47:34.240 --> 03:47:40.800]  up next, Roger Stone will be making another appearance live after he was released on Bond
[03:47:40.800 --> 03:47:47.840]  Today, $250,000 Bond for the crime of being a member of the media, essentially. So we're going
[03:47:47.840 --> 03:47:51.280]  to keep taking your calls. We've got Jeff, we've got Jacob, we've got John, we've got more people
[03:47:51.280 --> 03:47:57.520]  to talk to, but as I'm sitting here thinking about this in the break, I realize more and more
[03:47:57.520 --> 03:48:04.960]  this is their perfect distraction. They had the worst week ever, and it just kept going. Nancy
[03:48:04.960 --> 03:48:10.880]  Pelosi in the midst of a government shutdown is taking a three-day weekend right now, last just
[03:48:10.880 --> 03:48:16.080]  two days ago, and I guess she was speaking before the conference of mayors. She's stumbling over her
[03:48:16.080 --> 03:48:21.360]  words. She's doing her please clap where she tells the audience that's an applause line. Please clap
[03:48:21.360 --> 03:48:27.520]  now. Please clap. That's an applause line. She just looked awful in every single sense. How do we
[03:48:27.520 --> 03:48:32.640]  get this to stop being the news? How do we make BuzzFeed go away? How do we make the Covington
[03:48:32.640 --> 03:48:38.720]  teens go away? How do we make the absolutely horrendous leader known as Nancy Pelosi, the swamp
[03:48:38.720 --> 03:48:45.600]  creature who has lived for 30 plus years getting fat off the government? Right, she makes what?
[03:48:45.600 --> 03:48:48.960]  Forty grand a year? How is she getting so much money? How does she have multiple houses? How
[03:48:48.960 --> 03:48:54.080]  does Laura Loomer have to pick which house she goes to to chain herself to? It's very
[03:48:54.080 --> 03:48:58.880]  circumspect. So how do we make all that go away? Well, let's arrest Roger Stone. And if you read
[03:48:58.880 --> 03:49:05.440]  the CNN article, they specifically say that this indictment is not new. It was just unsealed on
[03:49:05.440 --> 03:49:10.480]  Friday, which goes to my hypothesis that this was planned. This was orchestrated. And Roger Stone
[03:49:10.480 --> 03:49:15.840]  is just the sacrificial lamb to the slaughter. Jeff has something to say about Roger Stone as
[03:49:15.840 --> 03:49:19.760]  well. He's been holding for about an hour. Thank you for your patience, Jeff from Vancouver.
[03:49:19.760 --> 03:49:27.040]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show. I'm Tom Pappert. Hey, Dom. Thanks a lot. Just wanted to say Alex
[03:49:27.040 --> 03:49:32.160]  spiritually was right on earlier in the show. And I think his analysis of the first interview
[03:49:32.160 --> 03:49:37.760]  with Roger was spot on. I think the media will take any scrap and then just stitch it together
[03:49:37.760 --> 03:49:45.520]  and just spend a bunch of BS the way they were set up to do. I think there's a real golden opportunity
[03:49:45.520 --> 03:49:51.280]  here, though, in any overreach. And this is tremendous overreach by the mainstream media
[03:49:51.280 --> 03:49:56.480]  and the political elite. There's an opportunity for a judo movement. I think this is it.
[03:49:57.120 --> 03:50:05.280]  Roger is an employee of Info Wars. I think if he stays exclusively speaking his piece through
[03:50:05.280 --> 03:50:11.440]  Info Wars and makes the mainstream media come to Info Wars and the general public come to Info
[03:50:11.440 --> 03:50:18.480]  Wars, I think it'll backfire against them. I think what Alex, I'm not telling them what to do,
[03:50:18.480 --> 03:50:26.400]  but a recommendation is fill the top stories of the day with William Binney, with Seth Rich,
[03:50:26.400 --> 03:50:33.120]  with Julie, hinting at Seth Rich. Well, and if you look at it, Jeff, that's exactly what happened
[03:50:33.120 --> 03:50:39.200]  this morning. That is precisely what happened this morning where Roger Stone, if the media was smart,
[03:50:39.200 --> 03:50:43.360]  they would have let him come out there and they would have been quiet as a church mouse and then
[03:50:43.360 --> 03:50:48.320]  CNN could have had him live and MSNPC could have had him live and all of these different
[03:50:48.320 --> 03:50:53.360]  organizations could have had him live, but instead they forced Roger to go to the Alex Jones show
[03:50:53.360 --> 03:50:59.360]  top linked on Drudge and he got his word out there in a more powerful, more concise and more,
[03:50:59.360 --> 03:51:04.320]  frankly, professional way than the media ever would have allowed him to. They didn't get to take
[03:51:04.320 --> 03:51:08.320]  a sound bite and now if they do take a sound bite, this is the real beautiful part, let's say
[03:51:08.320 --> 03:51:13.680]  when Roger Stone is on the war room, coming up here in about 12, 10 minutes, when Roger Stone is
[03:51:13.680 --> 03:51:18.000]  on the war room, let's say they want to take a sound bite out of that. Well, people can just go
[03:51:18.000 --> 03:51:24.800]  InfoWars.com slash show and watch the full episode and actually see it in context. I think you're
[03:51:24.800 --> 03:51:31.360]  absolutely right. This is a tremendous opportunity disguised as a tragedy and it just matters that
[03:51:31.360 --> 03:51:36.720]  people support, which is why it's so important. People go to infowarsstore.com, get a water filter,
[03:51:36.720 --> 03:51:42.560]  get an air filter. I also have a Pro Pure Breeze air filter in my apartment. I live in a 110 year
[03:51:42.560 --> 03:51:47.120]  old building. I'm a little bit fearful of asbestos at times. They tell me that there's none here,
[03:51:47.120 --> 03:51:52.560]  but I do wonder and I sleep better at night literally, not figuratively, because of that
[03:51:52.560 --> 03:51:56.800]  Pro Pure Breeze air filter. We're running out of time here. We've got about 10 minutes left
[03:51:56.800 --> 03:52:00.480]  to the show. I want to remind everybody, Roger Stone will be coming up on War Room next, but
[03:52:00.480 --> 03:52:07.280]  let's go to Jacob in Ohio who wants to talk about FBI corruption and believe me, this could be a
[03:52:07.280 --> 03:52:12.400]  great example of that. Welcome to the show, Jacob. This is the Alex Jones show. I'm Tom Pappert.
[03:52:13.280 --> 03:52:18.800]  Well, hello, Tom. We will see the downfall of Mueller as an example of God's justice.
[03:52:18.800 --> 03:52:24.240]  The raid on Roger Stone's home and these Gestapo media circus tactics remind me of what happened
[03:52:24.240 --> 03:52:28.880]  to my friend Schaefer Cox. He just tried to defend his family, and now he's in a CIA-controlled
[03:52:28.880 --> 03:52:37.200]  prison with Jihadis. The false statement charges that you see against Roger Stone is the favorite,
[03:52:37.200 --> 03:52:42.880]  a trumped-up charge for the DOJ. They use them against Ted Stevens to pass Obamacare,
[03:52:42.880 --> 03:52:50.240]  and that polar pen-team link to the prosecution against Schaefer Cox in Alaska as well.
[03:52:51.360 --> 03:52:56.560]  See, I hope you're absolutely right. All the media, CNN was camping out. They're now saying
[03:52:56.560 --> 03:53:01.920]  that their journalists are just brilliant mind readers. They're nostradamus, and they've been
[03:53:01.920 --> 03:53:08.400]  able to preemptively see that today was the day that Roger Stone would be arrested. But there's
[03:53:08.400 --> 03:53:12.960]  obviously been some collusion between the Mueller camp. At least, it seems that way. Obviously,
[03:53:12.960 --> 03:53:18.160]  there's no proof. But apparently, you can throw that accusation around without proof these days.
[03:53:18.160 --> 03:53:21.280]  But it sure seems like they were talking to each other, and they were coordinating,
[03:53:21.280 --> 03:53:25.440]  and they were celebrating. If you read the CNN article I was referencing earlier,
[03:53:25.440 --> 03:53:30.720]  to them, it's an early birthday present. Christmas comes twice in 2019 for CNN.
[03:53:30.720 --> 03:53:35.680]  And I think regular, average, everyday Americans are going to see this. Infowars,
[03:53:35.680 --> 03:53:39.920]  viewers especially, because you guys are the most tuned in people in the world.
[03:53:39.920 --> 03:53:45.920]  You're going to see this, and you're going to see CNN salivating over destroying a 66-year-old man's
[03:53:45.920 --> 03:53:50.080]  life. And they just celebrate it, and they're so antsy, and they're excited, and they're smiling,
[03:53:50.080 --> 03:53:56.320]  and they're energetic again. We're finally going to get Trump. And it disgusts normal people. It
[03:53:56.320 --> 03:54:02.160]  makes them disgusted. It causes a gut-level reaction. Like Alex Jones says, it's your spirit
[03:54:02.160 --> 03:54:08.400]  rejecting this evil. And that's what this is. The idea that we're going to destroy a 66-year-old
[03:54:08.400 --> 03:54:12.720]  man's life, a patriot since he was 12 years old, and his neighbor handed him a book about
[03:54:12.720 --> 03:54:18.080]  Barry Goldwater. This is disgusting. And normal people, I think, can see that. Well,
[03:54:18.080 --> 03:54:21.520]  thank you so much, Jacob. I want to keep taking calls, because we only have a few minutes left.
[03:54:21.520 --> 03:54:25.120]  Let's go to John in Boston, who wants to talk about Roger Stone as well.
[03:54:25.120 --> 03:54:27.680]  John, welcome to the Alex Jones Show. I'm Tom Papert.
[03:54:27.680 --> 03:54:33.360]  Good afternoon, Tom. It's good to be with you. First and foremost, I just wanted to express
[03:54:33.360 --> 03:54:39.680]  my disgust for the way that they went and got Roger Stone today, as if he was El Chapo or Osama
[03:54:39.680 --> 03:54:46.480]  Bin Laden. It's just completely ridiculous. And the overreach is insane. But what the people
[03:54:46.480 --> 03:54:52.960]  who were hearing this don't realize is giving anybody this much power to operate under these
[03:54:52.960 --> 03:54:58.480]  circumstances can be used against you as well. Roger's just the first guy, and he happens to be
[03:54:58.480 --> 03:55:05.280]  on the Trump side right now, but it can go either way. It's part of me, the Machiavellian in me,
[03:55:05.280 --> 03:55:09.520]  and this is not necessarily the stance that the rational side of my brain takes. But part of me
[03:55:09.520 --> 03:55:15.040]  wishes that were true, that, hey, if the Democrats can do this, if Mueller can do this, then maybe
[03:55:15.040 --> 03:55:20.400]  Trump can. But one of the most horrifying things we've learned from the Trump administration is
[03:55:20.400 --> 03:55:26.800]  that the executive branch only has power if it's a globalist. Otherwise, it might as well be symbolic.
[03:55:26.800 --> 03:55:32.480]  Don't get me wrong, Trump has done some fantastic things. Taxes, great. Supreme Court, great.
[03:55:32.480 --> 03:55:39.120]  But Obama declared how many national emergencies, and Trump can't declare one. So I do, you know,
[03:55:39.120 --> 03:55:44.000]  that is, in an abstract sense, absolutely right. Once you create the ability for somebody to have
[03:55:44.000 --> 03:55:49.600]  this power, it can't really be contained. They've opened Pandora's box, but at the same time,
[03:55:49.600 --> 03:55:53.920]  I don't think it's going to be Trump who gets to exercise this power. And we better hope that there
[03:55:53.920 --> 03:55:59.840]  is nobody, you know, they say Trump is literally Hitler. They better hope no literal Hitler ever
[03:55:59.840 --> 03:56:05.840]  comes forward because they have empowered the executive office for some lunatic, some madman
[03:56:05.840 --> 03:56:10.400]  who actually wants to take this power, who wants to take the ring and not throw it into the volcano.
[03:56:10.400 --> 03:56:15.440]  They have given him unlimited power. And I make the case, I think Mueller is the strongest, most
[03:56:15.440 --> 03:56:22.000]  powerful man on the face of the earth right now. He has more power than Mao version two in China,
[03:56:22.000 --> 03:56:27.920]  than Kim Jong-il in North Korea, than George Soros. He offers some trumped up charges,
[03:56:27.920 --> 03:56:33.120]  can essentially sentence a man to life in prison, Roger Stone, and it's disgusting. John, thank
[03:56:33.120 --> 03:56:38.240]  you so much for your call. You make a great point about the ability for the power structure to be
[03:56:38.240 --> 03:56:44.160]  abused or perhaps used correctly. So in our final minute or so here, I do want to remind everybody
[03:56:44.160 --> 03:56:50.640]  one more time, go to infowarstore.com. Alex Jones, he is the tip of the spear. It is tomorrow's news
[03:56:50.640 --> 03:56:55.200]  today. He has broken more stories than anybody else. You know, in my little meme community on
[03:56:55.200 --> 03:57:01.680]  Facebook, got him for Trump. We joke. If you think Alex Jones is crazy, give it 18 months,
[03:57:01.680 --> 03:57:06.240]  and he will be proven completely accurate. And if you want to see this type of journalism
[03:57:06.240 --> 03:57:11.040]  continue, if you want to see this type of breaking news continue, they're going to need money. They're
[03:57:11.040 --> 03:57:15.200]  going to need money to fight this with Roger Stone. Alex Jones is inevitably going to be the next
[03:57:15.200 --> 03:57:20.640]  target or one of the next targets. They're going to need financial resources to do that. So go to
[03:57:20.640 --> 03:57:26.880]  infowarstore.com, go to stonedefencefund.com. And personally, ever since my supply of supermail
[03:57:26.880 --> 03:57:33.440]  vitality ran out, I'm a big fan of alpha power. I think that it works quite well as a, not necessarily
[03:57:33.440 --> 03:57:39.280]  a substitute, but an alternative to supermail vitality. So this has been Tom Pappert guest
[03:57:39.280 --> 03:57:44.000]  hosting the Alex Jones show. You can catch me on Facebook weeknights, 8pm, got it.
