[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:20.960]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.960 --> 00:29.920]  man I've got a lot of incredible news to cover today as we do every day but it does
[00:29.920 --> 00:40.400]  literally as you know get crazier by the minute but I sent one of my crew members up to Dallas
[00:40.400 --> 00:48.160]  to poke around for the 50th anniversary of the JFK assassination and just to find out the
[00:48.160 --> 00:53.120]  lay of the land and what's going on they're actually planning on blocking not just right
[00:53.120 --> 00:58.640]  around Dealey Plaza that's the official story on the city website on the Dallas morning news
[00:59.680 --> 01:05.840]  they're planning to block it about four or five blocks down and basically shut down a third of
[01:05.840 --> 01:11.360]  downtown Dallas and they tried to claim the city tried to claim no bull horns no demonstrations
[01:11.360 --> 01:17.680]  in the city period and declare there was no first amendment a lawsuit was filed and an injunction
[01:17.680 --> 01:30.880]  was handed down and now much of what the city has been trying to do has been struck down by a court
[01:31.520 --> 01:37.280]  but I'm here to tell you they will still try to violate the first amendment on that day so because
[01:37.280 --> 01:43.360]  they're doing that I've got a lot of legal lawful constitutional things I'm going to do in the face
[01:43.360 --> 01:53.920]  of the tyrants we're going to print up 100 000 flyers and I'm going to be in Dallas next Wednesday
[01:53.920 --> 01:59.680]  night and I will announce a location on info wars.com Wednesday night you will check it on your
[01:59.680 --> 02:05.600]  smartphones if you choose to take this mission and he will put up the flyers in legal and lawful
[02:05.600 --> 02:12.160]  areas Thursday they will pull them down from legal and lawful areas public commons areas where other
[02:12.160 --> 02:17.280]  handbills are posted under common law they'll only tear ours down and claim it's illegal
[02:17.280 --> 02:24.960]  we will then hit them again Friday and again Saturday they're going to have the entire international
[02:24.960 --> 02:33.040]  media there billions will be tuning in and they want to try to sell the fraud that a lone unicorn
[02:33.040 --> 02:39.120]  fired a bullet out of a schoolbook building through two trees and hit the president and then
[02:39.120 --> 02:45.600]  the magic lucky charms easter bunny bullet uh was able to do all this we're not there to debate that
[02:45.600 --> 02:52.560]  we've won 90 plus percent of americans and major polls even higher with europeans know the government
[02:52.560 --> 02:57.760]  killed kennedy a shadow element of the government well we've had the lawyers go public the mistresses
[02:57.760 --> 03:07.120]  go public the the hitman commander go public e howard hunt on and on and on and on by the way
[03:07.120 --> 03:12.080]  he was fingered as the commander of the operation on the ground the ground captain the quarterback
[03:12.080 --> 03:18.000]  you could say of the big event sued liberty lobby and lost the court found there was evidence
[03:18.000 --> 03:24.000]  e howard hunt was there and he later admitted i was there backbenching and running of the big event
[03:24.560 --> 03:30.160]  we were going to kill him in my amma and then chicago but that secret service agent blew the
[03:30.160 --> 03:35.840]  whistle in chicago so dallas was the place of course texas always gets the job done
[03:35.840 --> 03:43.520]  but the point is is that i'm not proud of us down here but we do seem to do what we say we're
[03:43.520 --> 03:49.520]  going to do historically and the whole point is is that the main event happened in dallas 50 years
[03:49.520 --> 03:54.320]  ago and listen they could be saying they're shutting the city of dallas down there's no free speech
[03:54.320 --> 04:00.400]  for gay people and i would probably go up there and demonstrate it i mean they could be saying
[04:00.400 --> 04:06.400]  they're having an anti dog rally or or an anti christian rally or whatever and that no one was
[04:06.400 --> 04:10.320]  allowed to come and protest it i would show up i don't care if it's a group i disagreed with if
[04:10.320 --> 04:15.280]  they were trying to take the black panthers uh rights away i'd be up there against it they were
[04:15.280 --> 04:21.120]  trying to take the kook luxe clans uh right to speak away i would support it because if they
[04:21.120 --> 04:25.040]  can take theirs they can take mine folks they've already butchered the fourth amendment tenth
[04:25.040 --> 04:32.240]  amendment second amendment but it really is hitting me how big a deal this is so a lot of my
[04:32.240 --> 04:38.160]  crew is going to be down there i'm going to be there and it's my hometown i was born less than
[04:38.160 --> 04:44.720]  a mile from where kennedy got his head blown off and uh i was born in the hospital right next to
[04:44.720 --> 04:50.720]  parkland there's two of them right there the point is is that i'm going back to my hometown
[04:50.720 --> 04:55.280]  but let folks know the first amendment exists come hell or high water and we are now going
[04:55.280 --> 05:03.600]  to hand out a hundred thousand flyers and a lot more stay with us strategic relocation is a systematic

[08:25.040 --> 08:39.840]  jones ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this friday worldwide transmission
[08:41.440 --> 08:52.240]  it is the 15th day of november 2013 seven days from now i will be broadcasting live
[08:52.240 --> 09:00.800]  live from outside deli plaza because no one who doesn't agree with the official story
[09:02.560 --> 09:12.000]  including dan rather i've read uh are allowed into the kill zone uh the the people that killed
[09:12.000 --> 09:18.880]  kennedy and the power structure that killed kennedy to bring in the black ops cia offshore
[09:18.880 --> 09:28.560]  banking coup d'etat are going to be there trying to prop up the collapsed facade that is the official
[09:28.560 --> 09:40.320]  story of what happened to john f kennedy in 1963 on november 22nd we've won the info war
[09:40.320 --> 09:49.680]  when it comes to exposing that it was a black op the average poll is 90 or higher scientific poll
[09:49.680 --> 09:56.320]  believing that there is a conspiracy and a cover-up congress back in the 70s found with a 99
[09:56.320 --> 10:02.320]  percent certainty that's the quote that it was a multi shooter conspiracy from the acoustics and
[10:02.320 --> 10:07.600]  witnesses to kill john f kennedy now you know that the warring commission covered it up years before
[10:07.600 --> 10:14.000]  and was filled with people that were enemies of kennedy and we know they killed his brother and
[10:14.000 --> 10:19.040]  the police department report says that sir hands sir hang out his arm pinned none of the shots went
[10:19.040 --> 10:25.920]  into john f kennedy's brother bobby kennedy the list goes on and on the establishment assassinated
[10:26.640 --> 10:32.880]  two people that actually tried to be real presidents one who became president was a real
[10:32.880 --> 10:38.960]  president certainly not perfect i don't romanticize him had his own gangster tendencies the other one
[10:39.920 --> 10:44.480]  tried to become president and said that once he did he was going to go after him and that's all
[10:44.480 --> 10:49.120]  on record they think you're stupid just like they think you wouldn't read obama care and they
[10:49.120 --> 10:54.320]  could get it through and folks didn't read it but now they know it's a screw job it's on record how
[10:54.320 --> 10:59.600]  they killed kennedy and it's on record how they killed his brother the younger kennedy
[10:59.600 --> 11:06.800]  but that's not why i'm going to dallas next wednesday night thursday friday and saturday
[11:06.800 --> 11:11.280]  because they're going to continue the propaganda the next day they would never give any other group
[11:11.280 --> 11:20.000]  the dealie plaza park they would never give a historical group a research group a permit to
[11:20.000 --> 11:26.000]  hold a demonstration or rally there and they have the schoolbook building as a giant propaganda center
[11:26.000 --> 11:34.480]  of lies and deception and fraud they've rolled out everyone from boogly oc to tom hanks
[11:36.160 --> 11:39.680]  to try to prop up the collapsed Humpty Dumpty that's in a million pieces
[11:40.720 --> 11:45.600]  and all the king's horses and all the king's men all the propagandists can't put their
[11:46.400 --> 11:51.200]  asinine lie back together again and they march the patsy out
[11:51.200 --> 11:57.200]  Lee harvey oswald i'm a patsy they're setting me up don't let him kill me march him outside
[11:59.440 --> 12:08.400]  and then they march the marine out to kill him another timothy mcvay literally a military officer
[12:08.400 --> 12:13.280]  believing he was deep cover infiltration of communist in plots to kill kennedy so they
[12:13.280 --> 12:19.040]  could shut him up and blame communist if they wanted to but then they use the threat against
[12:19.040 --> 12:24.080]  the russians for concessions that we're going to set you up with our double agent that we sent
[12:24.080 --> 12:29.680]  to russia and allowed back in run by white russians here in the u.s that doesn't mean white
[12:29.680 --> 12:33.840]  people folks know every time i talk about black slavery white slavery people even know the different
[12:33.840 --> 12:38.000]  types of nothing to do with black people or white people uh same thing with white russians it just
[12:38.000 --> 12:46.480]  means pro czarist but but the issue is is that if you know the history they 100% setting up
[12:46.480 --> 12:52.080]  and then killed him publicly he was the patsy part of the drill
[12:56.640 --> 13:01.760]  and the moral of the story is if you're a marine and they want you to simulate going to kill the
[13:01.760 --> 13:06.800]  president or they want you to infiltrate some kind of patriot group that they claims terrorist
[13:06.800 --> 13:12.080]  the patriot groups really a bunch of feds planning something and they're going to set you up
[13:12.080 --> 13:19.840]  up just like in mark wallberg's excellent film that at the end of the film they basically admit
[13:19.840 --> 13:26.560]  is a composite of what happened with kennedy but then repeated in modern times with an example
[13:26.560 --> 13:31.520]  of a criminal combined government running things that film the shooter or is it just shooter
[13:32.960 --> 13:41.120]  should be required viewing shooter just shooter should be required viewing because it explains
[13:41.120 --> 13:44.000]  exactly how they do these things okay
[13:48.560 --> 13:53.920]  and i know that a lot of hollywood script writers and producers back when i would still go out to
[13:53.920 --> 13:58.400]  los angeles interviewed me and claimed they wanted me to have a writing credit on things
[13:58.400 --> 14:05.280]  i even sat down multiple times with major directors and producers and writers with scripts basically
[14:05.280 --> 14:11.360]  like the shooter now now that doesn't mean my ideas are actually in the shooter hollywood's fully
[14:11.360 --> 14:16.880]  awake to this kind of stuff and they're not just doing revelation of the method or externalization
[14:16.880 --> 14:22.160]  of the hierarchy as a propaganda ploy they know what's going on and they're kept on a very short
[14:22.160 --> 14:30.080]  leash by the big agency owners they're kept on a very short leash by the heads of the studios
[14:30.080 --> 14:38.400]  but uh i i saw a bunch of scripts very similar to shooter except one of them had so ghorney weavered
[14:41.360 --> 14:44.640]  in it playing the part of somebody in the white house shut up in a false flag
[14:46.960 --> 14:51.520]  well so ghorney weaver was the president in it but then there was another script and i don't
[14:51.520 --> 14:56.160]  mean just scripts floating around hollywood i mean high level meetings with like major a-list
[14:56.160 --> 15:02.880]  directors you know wanting to sit in there like five hour meetings picking my brain about the
[15:02.880 --> 15:08.080]  new world order assassination black ops false flags and then i have seen some of those same names
[15:08.080 --> 15:12.160]  make different movies than they were looking at making but but but very similar it's just it's just
[15:12.160 --> 15:22.720]  strange and what do i get out of it nothing except you know hollywood making the you know
[15:22.720 --> 15:27.680]  wanted child kidnapper named alex jones of the new movie i mean i just look all sorts of nice
[15:27.680 --> 15:34.880]  little things they do the point is is that i meander around i start talking about one
[15:34.880 --> 15:39.360]  subject and leads into another and then leads into another because believe me this is teleprompter
[15:39.360 --> 15:52.000]  free radio teleprompter free television now let me just stop for a minute and kind of reset here
[15:52.000 --> 15:56.000]  and tell you what's coming up today let me just do this because i hardly ever get to the video clips
[15:56.720 --> 16:00.800]  the audio clips this is the type of stuff i have just today in my video clips
[16:01.840 --> 16:12.080]  Oprah Winfrey bbc many disrespect obama because he's black not because uh he is a criminal front man
[16:13.760 --> 16:19.360]  now actually a lot of folks are embarrassed and upset at the system using a part black guy
[16:19.360 --> 16:27.040]  uh to sell all this fraud on the backs of people hoping for reconciliation uh and uh for a color
[16:27.040 --> 16:33.440]  blind society what they are is totally betraying people's trust and goodwill and then calling
[16:33.440 --> 16:40.720]  people that wake up racist when they're being run over by team obama and his legion of criminals
[16:40.720 --> 16:51.680]  uh cbs's major garret confronts obama on broken keep your plan promises there's a new
[16:52.400 --> 16:58.800]  interview where he gets confronted congressman exposes dhs buildup for civil unrest secret police
[16:58.800 --> 17:05.600]  force not a conspiracy no it's in the bill so is paying for implanted microchips in the
[17:05.600 --> 17:12.400]  citizenry i mean i'm i mean i've scanned over the bill folks it is 10 000 pages plus of addendums
[17:12.400 --> 17:20.640]  and writers 3000 plus pages of the actual bill and the stuff in there is so bad in obama care
[17:21.200 --> 17:26.480]  that you're reading it and you're like this allows the insurance companies to quadruple
[17:26.480 --> 17:34.640]  within three years of it being implemented 2016 it allows them to quadruple the average
[17:34.640 --> 17:38.560]  and it's going to double the first year and you're reading this and you're going there's no way
[17:39.120 --> 17:43.840]  you don't know the public will put up with that actually they they don't want to be racist so
[17:43.840 --> 17:47.440]  they'll they'll they'll do it i mean it's like literally throw your child in a woodchip or you're
[17:47.440 --> 18:00.320]  racist and the average trendy would do it uh so i continues hillary clinton 2007 says you can
[18:00.320 --> 18:04.640]  keep your plan if you like it the same bull it's the same quarter backing from the globalist they're
[18:04.640 --> 18:10.320]  just front puppets that basically broadcast and repeat the globalist message macov he's come out
[18:10.320 --> 18:17.840]  and said that um said that the site is executing a denial of service attack on itself that's actually
[18:17.840 --> 18:23.680]  what mike adams who's a really good programmer said first the first day it wasn't working the first
[18:23.680 --> 18:27.520]  day it came out he said this isn't set up and a bunch of the programmers have said that now too
[18:27.520 --> 18:31.280]  yeah no no that's the point something meant to work folks so it all becomes oh you can't get
[18:31.280 --> 18:36.080]  the free thing because it's broken oh that's all right oh you meant well the site is broken
[18:40.240 --> 18:45.280]  spying on you works 100 perfectly integrating everything you do into one government database
[18:45.280 --> 18:51.040]  but they can't let you go into an exchange where it's like a basically ebay and you just can pick
[18:51.040 --> 18:56.560]  you know different i mean it's just total watch you'll never get your free health care until it's
[18:56.560 --> 19:01.680]  death care and you will get that finally but you're going to pay private corporations thousands of
[19:01.680 --> 19:06.880]  dollars per pill they make you swallow okay when they're done and you're gonna love it i get it that's
[19:06.880 --> 19:12.080]  why they're gonna take your bank accounts lower the wages break the country deindustrialize shut
[19:12.080 --> 19:16.480]  everything down force and oculate your kids take your 11 year old to have an abortion without you
[19:16.480 --> 19:24.240]  giving authorization because they know sheep suckers when they see it these gangsters know people
[19:24.240 --> 19:30.720]  that are done like a hog that's been hauled up by its ankles and had its throat slit you bled out
[19:30.720 --> 19:37.360]  it's time to smoke you and when you're and you'll be sitting there on that smoker burning and when
[19:37.360 --> 19:42.800]  it comes time you'll say i'm done on this side please flip me and they'll say shut up terrorist
[19:42.800 --> 19:47.920]  karate chop you right in the throat and gurgling through blood you will thank them because they
[19:47.920 --> 19:52.720]  gouge your eyeballs out with big red pokers anyways we got a bunch of news coming up

[24:57.120 --> 25:02.320]  i went along i went along the girl the man's a little bloke
[25:02.320 --> 25:10.400]  and when the yards broke off they said that i got killed but i'm living still
[25:10.400 --> 25:20.320]  but i'm living still i got some oil and jennings coming up i was a damn building across the river
[25:20.320 --> 25:27.600]  deep and wild steel and water did cry we're stealing what it did collide a place called boulder
[25:27.600 --> 25:34.400]  a place called boulder on the wild car that's right it's advanced karaoke without a show
[25:34.400 --> 25:39.360]  i slipped and fell into the wet concrete but unfortunately i'm out of putt all song there it
[25:39.360 --> 25:44.240]  is the highway man they buried me and left grade two isn't it the songs by the highway
[25:44.240 --> 25:50.000]  first song the first battle i'm still alive talk about a outlaw country i love the way
[25:50.000 --> 25:59.920]  they talk about don't have one song with their five albums isn't that a is they say oh i can't
[25:59.920 --> 26:08.960]  i can't stop here here he comes johnny cash baby i play a starship across the universe divide
[26:08.960 --> 26:15.680]  when i reach the other side and when i reach the other side i'll find a place to rest my spirit
[26:15.680 --> 26:23.360]  i can't find a place to rest my spirit if i can perhaps i may become perhaps i may become a
[26:23.360 --> 26:28.960]  highway man again you know it's all about non caring ladies and gentlemen you know i don't
[26:28.960 --> 26:33.680]  think this song and i actually talked to willy about it he is so much about he agreed with me
[26:36.960 --> 26:44.160]  me and willy were talking over some over over a chessboard but the whole point is
[26:44.160 --> 26:49.840]  is that i was saying is that song about reincarnation or is it more about how adventurism and humanity
[26:49.840 --> 26:57.040]  could continue on to the stars and how others will live on and and then our genetics live on
[26:58.240 --> 27:04.400]  into the future as long as there is trailblazing and adventure and he said
[27:06.560 --> 27:08.720]  i can't copy the way willy Nelson talks but he's like
[27:08.720 --> 27:16.320]  i think that's exactly what it's saying i think that's exactly what we meant
[27:22.080 --> 27:24.320]  because i play that song sometime they're playing the intro of it
[27:25.200 --> 27:28.800]  the first 30 seconds or so i've never played the whole song or a large chunk of it
[27:29.440 --> 27:36.880]  and uh people are like what's he doing playing that in reincarnation stuff on there well i am
[27:36.880 --> 27:45.440]  the genetic reincarnation of all my ancestors that's pretty heavy right there folks ever think about
[27:45.440 --> 27:52.800]  that and that's why i don't like cheating other people and going after other people i mean we're
[27:52.800 --> 27:58.400]  all related to each other one way or another i don't care where you are in the world you
[27:58.400 --> 28:04.880]  trace your roots back to africa and it's just literally and it doesn't matter if people are
[28:04.880 --> 28:08.880]  like rats that matter if they're low down and evil that matter you know when somebody's trying
[28:08.880 --> 28:13.280]  to crush you you got to go ahead and crush them but it doesn't mean i enjoy it it doesn't mean
[28:13.280 --> 28:17.520]  that you know there's vipers and scum out there they have to be dealt with and you know good people
[28:17.520 --> 28:21.440]  deal with them i think one of you know good folks as big as problems we don't tend to stand up for
[28:21.440 --> 28:28.400]  ourselves we need to but we also need to build up and hold up the innocent that's our number one
[28:28.400 --> 28:32.560]  job is to come to the aid of people that are having their rights violated people that are being
[28:32.560 --> 28:38.640]  overrun because that's how we all stand together or we hang separate and i've even gotten to the
[28:38.640 --> 28:42.800]  news as a short segment i'm going to control myself and be well behaved and i'm going to come back
[28:42.800 --> 28:47.040]  focused problems i go over all this news at night in the morning and then once i get here and then
[28:47.040 --> 28:53.360]  it's it's kind of like man do i need to really tell everybody this stuff because let me tell you
[28:53.360 --> 29:02.800]  it is big and it is bad and it is stinky but i it's just kind of like a land thing a big boil
[29:03.760 --> 29:06.720]  that's on the bottom of your foot or something where you step on a rusty nail
[29:07.920 --> 29:11.600]  and then it's hurting really bad and it swells up and you hadn't gone to the doctor and you
[29:11.600 --> 29:16.160]  hadn't told your parents about it get home from school and it's all swell up in red and hurting
[29:16.160 --> 29:24.320]  and you just go get a knife go get a knife out of the block and yeah heat it up red hot and
[29:24.320 --> 29:28.640]  just stick it in there and all that pus comes out of there and it feels so good and i think
[29:28.640 --> 29:33.760]  that's kind of did that once when i was a kid i think that's kind of what this comes down to
[29:36.880 --> 29:41.120]  and i didn't know why i knew how to cauterize the woman but see all the genetic information is
[29:41.120 --> 29:47.680]  right there i've got everything my ancestors had right there combat ready we'll be right back

[33:28.560 --> 33:33.520]  revolution in their minds the children start to march
[33:36.720 --> 33:39.280]  how about counter revolution against tyranny
[33:39.280 --> 33:52.000]  there is a revolution of oppression and i personally am not going to stand here idly by
[33:52.000 --> 33:57.920]  and let our society be engineered into one based on fraud and deceit instead of innovation
[33:57.920 --> 34:05.520]  honor and enlightenment it's very very simple and folks out there need to decide historically
[34:05.520 --> 34:13.760]  historically what decision we want to make now in the present going in to the breach which is the
[34:13.760 --> 34:22.560]  future we're in a forward leaning time warp ladies and gentlemen if you look at the quantum mechanics
[34:26.000 --> 34:32.880]  the rush of the universe goes by us through us and we flow with it and when you realize that
[34:32.880 --> 34:40.720]  it's such a joke to be obsessed with the pomp and circumstance and red carpets and all of the
[34:40.720 --> 34:49.520]  fake status garbage which means absolutely nothing if it is projected by the establishment
[34:49.520 --> 34:54.560]  because the establishment wants you to be obsessed with issues of little or no significance
[34:54.560 --> 35:04.480]  so that they can rule the future destiny of this species and steer us into oblivion because that
[35:04.480 --> 35:24.080]  is their great goal now let me just do this
[35:24.080 --> 35:36.480]  let me just do this here on air there's so much i want to get to and i mean that's
[35:36.480 --> 35:42.480]  the problem i get in here and i look at all this news and it is just it is just too insane to even
[35:42.480 --> 35:45.360]  sometimes even try to get into it it makes my head spin we're going to get the latest on
[35:45.360 --> 35:55.600]  Obamacare big economic developments just just just all sorts of internet freedom takeovers
[35:56.240 --> 36:11.200]  it's all coming up here today and expanding expanding on it just briefly
[36:11.200 --> 36:15.680]  i wanted to just remind listeners
[36:18.800 --> 36:29.360]  that well we have a lot of important news i want to get to here but i wanted to remind
[36:29.360 --> 36:39.040]  listeners here today that the reason i'm promoting atomic proprietary iodine is because
[36:39.040 --> 36:43.600]  i did the research from the mainline medical studies the nutritionist you name it you've
[36:43.600 --> 36:50.400]  heard many of them here on the air that iodine and the pure forms of iodine are one of the biggest
[36:50.400 --> 36:55.360]  secrets that the establishment is keeping from the public and it's hidden in plain view i mean
[36:55.360 --> 37:00.240]  just as they put the dangerous halogens the fluorine all the rest of the garbage and the
[37:00.240 --> 37:05.840]  water and the food that we don't need that's so toxic and bad they then keep the good iodine out
[37:05.840 --> 37:11.920]  of the food supply knowingly back before our government was eugenics run was only partially
[37:11.920 --> 37:18.080]  eugenics run from the 20s into the 50s they basically mandated the food producers to put
[37:18.080 --> 37:25.440]  iodine in the food and then of course i have the studies right here i could show tv viewers
[37:27.040 --> 37:33.200]  how adding iodine to salt resulted in the decades worth of iq gains for the united states a 15
[37:33.200 --> 37:39.680]  point increase and that's a major study that's from business insider again here's the harvard study
[37:39.680 --> 37:45.200]  from roiders harvard study confirms flora reduces children's iq so they put something
[37:45.200 --> 37:48.880]  in the water that reduces iq on record at the level they're putting it in
[37:50.800 --> 37:55.680]  and then they remove the thing that your brain's got to have i mean there's all the studies about
[37:56.720 --> 38:00.480]  chromosomal disorders retardation i mean there's a whole bunch of disorders
[38:00.480 --> 38:05.920]  directly linked to iodine deficiency and pregnant women and they don't tell women
[38:05.920 --> 38:12.880]  they need iodine period so yes i promote things that funder operation and make us strong and be
[38:12.880 --> 38:24.240]  able to expand with things that i believe in and that i know are really good and so we did get more
[38:24.240 --> 38:29.760]  of the sin they did expand the size of the laboratory where this is produced and this is
[38:29.760 --> 38:35.120]  the best iodine that i could find for myself and my family it's unbonded it's pure uh it's
[38:35.120 --> 38:41.920]  info wars live survival shield available at info wars life dot com that's info wars life

[39:16.240 --> 39:21.440]  two dollars on the little pictures uh because there's already hardly any markup in those so when
[39:21.440 --> 39:27.920]  i got 20 on that it just gets rid additional 10 off that we do on the regular 10 literally

[39:51.120 --> 39:58.880]  this report obama is an actor trained by harry linux and that was said on a newsroom floor
[39:58.880 --> 40:03.680]  at fox tv studios in chicago in front of six people at least
[40:06.400 --> 40:10.240]  four of them that work for eric muller and two of them that were other guests and he
[40:10.240 --> 40:15.040]  literally trashed him for 10 minutes they said they said it was unbelievable in fact man cow
[40:15.040 --> 40:19.120]  didn't even say some of it on air as he said he didn't want to linux didn't say don't talk about
[40:19.120 --> 40:24.960]  it he said he just wasn't going to say it put it to that way he practically lived with him was the
[40:24.960 --> 40:31.920]  quote uh let's continue here janet uh yellen the new fed boss is pumping up the bubble machine
[40:31.920 --> 40:36.560]  he thought qe unlimited was bad get ready and of course they had a high level fed officer go public
[40:36.560 --> 40:41.760]  two days ago we covered it here on air and he said that he apologizes as the greatest transfer
[40:41.760 --> 40:47.280]  of wealth in us history and a robbery of our children's future it's a criminal takeover by
[40:47.280 --> 40:52.400]  foreign banks he now concurs with us see once you speak the great truth aloud it begins to echo
[40:52.400 --> 40:57.200]  around forever cia looking at your financial transactions curt nemo's written about that
[40:57.200 --> 41:03.360]  the new york times has a whitewash article out congressman warms of obama care security
[41:04.320 --> 41:09.280]  secret security force and we're going to play that clip we have it queued up uh coming up here
[41:09.280 --> 41:16.800]  in just a moment also obama care fix affirms obama as absolute dictator with power to change the
[41:16.800 --> 41:22.240]  laws as he pleases and this is what bonjino the famous secret service dan bonjino talks about
[41:22.240 --> 41:27.440]  and he's coming on in the third hour our story last week from info wars dot com went viral
[41:27.440 --> 41:33.680]  via drudge report dot com was biggest story we ever put out we had more traffic off of that one
[41:33.680 --> 41:40.800]  story than anything else ever for whatever reason uh at info wars dot com because he said you have
[41:40.800 --> 41:45.360]  no idea how bad obama really is i've signed national security agreements i can't tell you
[41:45.360 --> 41:52.720]  but you have no idea it's far worse than you think well i happen to know from another secret service
[41:52.720 --> 41:58.880]  source inside the white house and i hate even talking about stuff like this folks this is dangerous
[41:58.880 --> 42:02.720]  and it's nothing that can even get me killed it's just because they don't tell me anything specific
[42:02.720 --> 42:08.000]  it's just oh my god you're absolutely right i can't i can't i've got to get out of here i got to get
[42:08.000 --> 42:16.400]  a transfer oh it's unbelievable it's unbelievable god help america keep warning them and then i
[42:16.400 --> 42:21.600]  talked to another secret service agent over the phone i was with a famous person whose friends
[42:21.600 --> 42:26.080]  with them put me on he was showing me pictures with him and stuff and this person i know has
[42:26.080 --> 42:34.240]  been to the white house quite a bit and the guy started basically crying on the telephone to me
[42:34.240 --> 42:42.880]  okay it's bad enough folks that the secret service is crying crying
[42:45.520 --> 42:50.000]  you know i know why the public wants to sit there and say i'm full of it and oh it's an
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.960]  exaggeration because you know what i wish every day i was a liar i wish it wasn't this bad
[42:55.600 --> 43:01.040]  i wish i wasn't right because let me tell you folks i cry sometimes and i'm the type of guy
[43:01.040 --> 43:07.120]  that's had like compound fractures and stuff and didn't cry i get mad when i get hurt this is a
[43:07.120 --> 43:10.720]  spiritual thing when you realize and you look at your children and they're innocent and they're
[43:10.720 --> 43:14.880]  good and you realize that the evils hanging over them involuntarily i don't like start
[43:14.880 --> 43:22.400]  retching and crying tears to start pouring out my eyes they just start coming out because my brain
[43:22.400 --> 43:28.640]  is grieving so hard folks harder than when family members have died in fact if i start talking about
[43:28.640 --> 43:34.000]  it i may start my eyes start start watering it's beyond i used to get chills up and down my spine
[43:34.000 --> 43:40.720]  i don't really get that anymore i get it sometimes i start my i start literally tearing up ladies and
[43:40.720 --> 43:48.080]  gentlemen because when you realize that we're in the hands of evil see other it goes right there
[43:53.280 --> 43:58.160]  see i got all this news and i can't even read it i just it's just like what is the point what
[43:58.160 --> 44:04.160]  add more to just all the hellish stuff that's going on how much trouble we're in and the sadness
[44:04.160 --> 44:09.280]  that we have to go through this and put up with this i mean this is ridiculous and that's where
[44:09.280 --> 44:13.920]  the pain gives way to anger because the anger is basically a defense mechanism
[44:20.880 --> 44:24.080]  i do need to take a vacation i'll tell you right now but there is no taking a vacation
[44:24.080 --> 44:30.880]  all this is going on because i can't turn it off anyways in the face of this tyranny we must all
[44:30.880 --> 44:36.000]  stand up and speak out and tell the truth and i and i realize i am pre grieving it's like a pre
[44:36.000 --> 44:43.600]  nostalgia but an anti nostalgia like i realized the nightmare almost like a vision i've already
[44:43.600 --> 44:47.920]  seen the carnage seen that my understanding has been corrected to this point it's not hard the
[44:47.920 --> 44:51.840]  globalist brag what they're gonna do and it's like wow this nightmare is coming true but they
[44:51.840 --> 44:56.000]  they really are going to do it they really are going to break up our families shoot us all up
[44:56.000 --> 45:00.320]  with deadly vaccines that kill even more of us they really are poisoning the food and water
[45:00.320 --> 45:05.120]  they really are using all of our energy look at the light post and the buildings and the
[45:05.120 --> 45:11.280]  helicopters and the weapons and the aircraft carriers and the nsa bases and the power grids and
[45:12.240 --> 45:17.920]  all this stuff that our tax money and our energy and our work paid for we built this
[45:17.920 --> 45:23.760]  this and now they're not building any of that anymore all they're building is select infrastructure
[45:23.760 --> 45:29.520]  they own and control that's given to select offshore spanish and portuguese and british and
[45:29.520 --> 45:36.400]  dutch and globalist royalty you know owned companies and they're transferring all our
[45:36.400 --> 45:42.320]  wealth and the infrastructure to them to control us and dominate us and crush us through a high
[45:42.320 --> 45:57.920]  tech siege and our energy is being used to build this hellish thing and then i see arrested
[45:57.920 --> 46:02.480]  development you know young thuggish cops strutting around bugging their eyes out at people and it's
[46:02.480 --> 46:07.520]  just like whoa i don't even hate them or dislike them i just i know who they are i know more about
[46:07.520 --> 46:14.400]  them than they do i know more about them than their mama does and i just look at them i mean i
[46:14.400 --> 46:18.880]  know more about their psychology and what's been done to them because they're not the same person
[46:18.880 --> 46:24.720]  their mama took care of and they're just programmed and i've seen them we've seen them through history
[46:24.720 --> 46:29.360]  over and over again and it's like groundhog day ladies and gentlemen to know what we're going to
[46:29.360 --> 46:40.480]  go through over and over again and it's just like really really really you're that big a failure and
[46:40.480 --> 46:45.200]  i'm not singling out the police they just are where the rubber meets the road it's the whole system
[46:45.200 --> 46:50.960]  folks it's coming down by design let's let's go to this congressman from texas she's been on the
[46:50.960 --> 47:00.640]  show before he's a really good guy louis gomer the story is up on info wars dot com it's congressman
[47:00.640 --> 47:06.320]  warren's of obama care secret security force we got two big guests coming up today we have a real
[47:06.320 --> 47:12.640]  expert i don't i've read about this guy before but i heard he went up to stand my teeth show
[47:12.640 --> 47:18.000]  like two nights ago i was driving around austin and and i've read all the brzezinski's books
[47:18.000 --> 47:23.360]  i've studied trilateral commission quarterly reports i do send off and pay four years ago
[47:23.920 --> 47:29.440]  i have i mean i know their plan and i was learning stuff from this guy i do everything he was saying
[47:29.440 --> 47:34.400]  was accurate and then to a point i went and looked up some of the stuff i didn't know and found that
[47:34.400 --> 47:39.760]  it was accurate i mean he's got their plan down okay this guy went to the national archives in
[47:39.760 --> 47:44.240]  canada that's how you got to do this stuff you got to send off and pay for it or go to the archives
[47:44.240 --> 47:49.120]  or big law libraries will have it like ut library has a lot of it and he sat there and spent years
[47:49.120 --> 47:54.240]  reading it all and man they are going to sterilize everybody they're going to break up all our families
[47:54.240 --> 47:58.880]  they're going to put us in forced labor camps i mean they're just unbelievable all carnegie
[47:58.880 --> 48:05.680]  rockefeller ford foundation on record battle plan i mean on record you could convict them all
[48:05.680 --> 48:10.480]  right now nurenberg trials for their plan and what they've already carried out so far
[48:10.480 --> 48:17.920]  so gohmert has come out congressman warrens of obama care secret security force it's a seven
[48:17.920 --> 48:24.160]  minute clip up on the site where he goes through what's in the legislation and then he's setting up
[48:24.160 --> 48:29.200]  a national security force and that's what they're doing this in action because it's paramilitary
[48:29.200 --> 48:34.640]  when you read the fine print and then they hire former blackwater xc types as the security force
[48:34.640 --> 48:39.280]  to guard the federal buildings but they're not a security force they're an offensive force
[48:39.280 --> 48:46.640]  totally outside government let's play a few minutes of this clip new efforts in wisconsin
[48:47.200 --> 48:54.080]  in that area it it makes no sense whatsoever so i'm just giving all this background to
[48:54.080 --> 49:01.280]  listeners so they can understand that hopefully they should be skeptical of homeland security
[49:01.280 --> 49:07.040]  and the justice department as i think you and i are well i agree with you and and all the things
[49:07.040 --> 49:11.200]  that you've mentioned we've talked about a lot on the show as well alibi area and all the rest
[49:11.200 --> 49:15.280]  that you've talked about all very very important things but you know we've had a lot of people
[49:15.280 --> 49:21.840]  out there saying they're taking note of the 1.6 billion rounds of in part hollow hollow point
[49:21.840 --> 49:27.440]  ammunition which is to kill people not for target practice you've had most ranges don't let you use
[49:27.440 --> 49:34.080]  hollow points on the range right right structure of the target so that made no sense and i have asked
[49:34.080 --> 49:41.360]  uh folks on homeland security if they're you know what is the reason for that and i'm talking about
[49:41.360 --> 49:47.360]  the committee on homeland security in the house and uh they seem satisfied well apparently you
[49:47.360 --> 49:52.560]  know they just have to get this much ammunition when they're buying for all the different departments
[49:52.560 --> 50:00.640]  but uh janet that does not make sense and i i um i don't have answers on what they're doing um
[50:00.640 --> 50:05.280]  um and it we're going to come back and play the rest of it but but skip ahead because we
[50:05.280 --> 50:08.720]  don't have time to play it go to the club where he talks about the conspiracy here's that club
[50:10.080 --> 50:14.560]  so christians are looking at this and saying gee i hope my mind isn't going in a direction
[50:14.560 --> 50:19.040]  that's actually seeming that it's going and people don't want to think that way and seem
[50:19.040 --> 50:24.960]  conspiratorial but it's odd that they will not answer questions well and but you get back to
[50:24.960 --> 50:31.760]  reporters uh i think the reason that they're afraid to ask ask the tough questions about these
[50:31.760 --> 50:36.960]  kind of things is that they're afraid that all of their colleagues will immediately turn on them
[50:36.960 --> 50:43.440]  and say oh you're another right wing nut uh you know you you see a conspiracy everywhere i don't
[50:43.440 --> 50:50.160]  see conspiracies everywhere i just see really stupid moves being made by this administration
[50:50.160 --> 50:56.080]  that's right so uh what they're doing is power grabbing history is repeating itself the full
[50:56.080 --> 51:00.160]  interview there's even more is up on info wars dot com we're gonna come back into the latest on

[55:15.520 --> 55:20.080]  and fascism can read carol quickly's book the head of georgetown political science bill clinton's

[55:27.760 --> 55:32.160]  and it's just all right there and you know you're a dumb animal and you deserve to die
[55:32.160 --> 55:38.560]  and he publishes books saying that and he runs things so you know i was told by insider yesterday
[55:38.560 --> 55:48.800]  about making a film with about a billionaire and and he was working on the film and the billionaire
[55:48.800 --> 55:54.400]  well-known billionaire was at a big sports team event that he owns and was actually talking with
[55:54.400 --> 55:58.960]  some other billionaires about yeah the slaves don't need to you know know that we're doing this to

[56:16.880 --> 56:20.560]  and we're gonna have a total police state in place for their own good and then he would sit
[56:20.560 --> 56:31.680]  there laughing about everybody and i've been around this kind of stuff folks i mean this is a
[56:31.680 --> 56:38.400]  predatory conscious plan against you and your family and the sooner you figure that out the better
[56:40.160 --> 56:46.400]  then i was talking to another insider uh who'd multiple times been around a bunch of masons
[56:47.200 --> 56:54.000]  and how they would just talk so much trash about me when george washington the mason
[56:54.000 --> 57:02.400]  would literally spit on you i mean i'm not saying all masons are evil i'm not saying all branches
[57:02.400 --> 57:07.440]  of it go back to something bad i know the real history of it i've forgotten more about masonry
[57:07.440 --> 57:13.920]  than most masons know it's all right there in the history books i've had a lot of family that were
[57:13.920 --> 57:18.880]  high level masons i don't hide that fact and you know what they told my dad you know what they told
[57:18.880 --> 57:24.800]  me don't ever be a mason when you get asked don't ever be part of it is that understood
[57:25.680 --> 57:30.400]  i've had family that have been 33rd degree masons what do you think they discovered
[57:30.400 --> 57:37.600]  i've got family on both sides involved in the founding of texas loan star state you think i
[57:37.600 --> 57:49.120]  know about masons you know how many family aprons i've got in storage or my dad does
[57:49.120 --> 57:55.360]  the point is is that what masonry is today is something promoting the new world order
[57:55.360 --> 58:01.200]  you guys aren't doing anything to stop tyranny so you want to talk about how i'm bad i'm making
[58:01.200 --> 58:11.600]  all this stuff up i'm not making any of this up none of it none of it you hear that masons i want
[58:11.600 --> 58:19.120]  to have a show someday where for three hours i let the masons call in and i will quiz them to see
[58:19.120 --> 58:27.760]  if they really are masons and just tell me how i'm wrong about all this stuff let me ask masons
[58:27.760 --> 58:33.680]  something would george washington like what you do what you stand for you're all a bunch of nobodies
[58:33.680 --> 58:38.080]  on power trips because you're part of an organization that was taken over a long time ago

[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:34.080]  to fix obama care congress will have to stand down and allow obama to operate outside of the
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:38.720]  courts outside of law outside of congress and of course this is the big test now because the
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:43.760]  republican leadership you know helped write this with foreign banks so so they they wanted to go
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:49.600]  through that's their orders and so now obama will be like hey let me do what i want outside of law
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:54.400]  and i'll give you the free health care and then of course you'll let him be dictator it'll get even
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:01:00.480]  worse as i keep telling you for years and months specifically and then it'll just get worse and
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:04.000]  worse and worse it's kind of like you stuck your arm in something and something bit your
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.640]  finger off you wouldn't stick your arm back in there so you stick your arm in the obama care
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:14.880]  hole and you pull it out and three fingers are been chewed off and then you hear a voice going
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:20.640]  i love you stick your hand back in i'll give you a bag of gold if you stick your hand back in you
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:26.400]  know come to healthcare dot gov oh i love you i love you i love you and you go well it sounds sweet
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:33.200]  and what sounds like harry linux who now has gone public to media in
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.240]  chicago that he actually for years was there and trained obama and then you watch and listen to
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:46.320]  linux and you go back to videos him years ago he's obama he's the guy he's the american he's the
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:53.920]  smooth talking guy the shakesperian actor who trained obozo and i mean i mean we know obama
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:57.920]  i shouldn't call him obozo but i like to integrate their puppets he's actually a viciously successful
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:03.280]  puppet whose savagely stabbed america in the back a thousand times and we're bleeding out right now
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:08.000]  so he's actually the great destroyer the most successful new order agent ever against the
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:14.800]  republic benedict arnold rolls in his grave with jealousy flopping end of her end foaming at the
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:22.320]  mouth with with with just absolute repine uh let's uh get into some of the obozo care news
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:27.120]  they're now reporting that the fix could make it worse that's what mclatch is saying of course
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:33.920]  always going to make it worse that's the plan uh more navigators exposed in new video
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:41.120]  with the veritas project where they're telling them to engage in fraud and cheat everyone and lie
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:45.120]  on everything and commit felonies and that they work for the democratic party and then it's they're
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:49.200]  going to take over the country and no mainstream media is picking that up because again this is
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.160]  the age of total criminality uh gop warns of constitutional crisis but they're controlled
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:59.360]  at the top so don't expect anything uh democratic representatives says they haven't seen this much
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:05.760]  panic since 9 11 now that was a staged event too and uh the new york times says there's a crisis
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:12.880]  in confidence in obozo well doesn't matter he's not facing reelection so he's designed the abomination
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:20.160]  the ovomit that's the best thing because they're vomiting out their hatred on us with obama like
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:27.280]  boiling oil dumped off a castle wall on our heads so um we're saying it's a crisis in confidence
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:33.280]  and then that will run everyone to the shelf propelled baron harkinen job of the huts illegitimate
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:41.120]  son the governor of new jersey that will run everyone to him and his suspensor belts and
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:47.760]  then of course he'll come in and double down the savagery and then all the neocon talk show
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:52.160]  hustle defend him and say you're liberal if you don't like him and that i'm a commie because i don't
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:58.720]  like christie and all the rest of it i mean this is how they operate this is how the game works
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:03.360]  and if america puts up with this again i know there's electronic voting machines and a lot of fraud
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:08.240]  but it doesn't matter we should be out in the streets by the millions demanding the resignation
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:16.800]  of the abomination vomitus maximus uh ludus brutus
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:26.240]  tertis i mean i'm trying to come up with names in latin here a little bit of pig latin here
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:34.400]  to describe what they're doing to us ladies and gentlemen but uh i gotta have some gallows humor
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:38.560]  some of us have a really trouble dealing with this uh just watching the total criminal takeover
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:42.960]  and then dancing around on the grave of america shutting everything down restaurants i used to

[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:34.960]  jones
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:44.000]  ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this friday edition we are now
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.240]  into the second hour we have a guest that we're getting hooked up on skype right now who's an
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:54.880]  expert on the technotronic technocracy age of the govern the governing system that the global
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:09:00.560]  is to actually describe themselves as being adherents of and this is the system they're trying
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:07.360]  to set up so that's coming up here in a few minutes first off congressman mcdermott is saying he
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:14.160]  hasn't seen this much panic on the floor since 9 11 house democrat compares congressional panic
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:21.040]  over obama care to worst terror attack in nation's history well yeah that manufactured globalist
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:26.240]  event killed 3 000 people almost tragic and then thousands more from the deadly dust the government
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:33.280]  lied about but this is going to kill the economy and the engine of prosperity and kill millions
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:39.440]  through death panels and ration care on record i mean we knew what was in the bill we knew the plan
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:46.400]  and now get ready get ready to become impoverished because they want you impoverished under cloward
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:52.640]  and piven to give up on the free market blame capitalism for crony fraud capitalism that
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:58.720]  they brought in where they socialize our lives but then transfer the wealth to themselves so
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:06.480]  that is just some of the news also cbs is reporting that the tsa agent officer bled for 33 minutes
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:12.240]  and lax shooting airports are supposed to most secure places in the country except for like
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:17.840]  military bases and then this guy bled for 33 minutes while they got the swat team all suited up
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:22.960]  and ready again it's the culture of just worrying about their safety all day until the point is
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:30.400]  nobody's safe because a nanny state can do nothing but make you domesticated a nanny state can do
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:43.680]  nothing except basically turn you into a sheep it's so simple and then we've got the other news
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:51.760]  up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com uh reports out obama is an actor trained by harry
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:58.160]  linux this is a big deal if this goes viral that harry linux is saying and it's on record they were
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:07.520]  friends for about 17 years and that they had done work together and they go to others houses and now
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:16.320]  he reportedly says obama is horrible and is a rat that's another quote a rat uh and uh that uh
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:23.520]  obama was trained by him to be presidential and then of course if you watch uh harry linux to an
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:31.680]  interview it's obama the same cadence the same voice obama is copying linux or linux is copying
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:38.640]  obama it's like the same guy and i believe linux over over obama so that article and the source on
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:45.040]  that is up on info wars dot com right now also again um the the federal reserve is planning
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:50.400]  to accelerate money printing congressman warns of obama creating secret security force armed
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:56.400]  security force that's actually in the obama care bill and then the media is like uh he would never
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:00.800]  do that they've already set it up with mercenaries with top security clearances guarding federal
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:05.920]  buildings now and then the billions of bullets and all the training and the rest of it i mean this
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:15.920]  is just simply simply amazing and then some of the other news countdown u.s its debt ceiling in 84
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:22.080]  days and again obama said raising the debt does not raise the debt only not raising it that's the
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:30.960]  only thing that is um financially irresponsible we have a bigger debt than we have yearly gdp we
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:36.640]  have a higher debt to savings ratio than spain and greece that are both completely bankrupt
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:41.600]  and uh their answer is get a steeper into debt why not the globalists want us impoverished
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:48.720]  and if rand paul wants to cut the defense budget he's a trader and if ten crews wants to cut some
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:55.200]  of the corporate welfare and uh entitlement welfare oh he's a horrible person you can't
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:01.120]  continue to do this and have 101 million people on food assistance and 100 plus million people on
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:06.800]  government dole there's more people on the dole now than in the workforce let me say that again
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:13.680]  what about the people going bankrupt everywhere what about the people losing their houses well
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:19.120]  the folks that have been not working for five ten years they go i don't care tax the rich it's the
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:24.720]  ultra rich lobbying for that against the middle class their historic enemy to bankrupt the country
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:29.600]  once they've done that you're all going to have your welfare taken away here's an article china
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:37.600]  to ease one child policy that's because it's caused such a problem uh having uh upwards of what is
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:47.120]  it 60 70 more million men than they have women and it's causing all sorts of societal problems uh
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:52.880]  and and india is about to outstrip them in population and they've ended the labor camps that's
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:59.600]  being reported by roiders china unveils boldest reforms in decades shows that the new president
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:04.880]  is in command folks they don't need labor camps anymore because they call them jobs and you go
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:09.680]  in their suicide nets and they force drug you and forced abortion and you're basically locked up
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:18.320]  at night and they just don't call it labor camps and and don't worry china is now on the un human
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:24.320]  human rights board deciding what's human rights along with cuba along with cuba it's better
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:30.720]  saudi arabia is probably a bigger tyranny than china per capital donning worse is north korea
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:37.280]  and i expect them to be made you know the head of the un operation so that's just some of the news
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:42.800]  up on info wars dot com up on prison planet dot com um epa block cities from installing
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:50.960]  fire hydrants again uh the epa shutting down over 500 power plants bloomberg reports philadelphia
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:55.760]  has 119 fire hydrants that cost about 2000 each waiting in a warehouse to be installed yet they
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:02.560]  sit there uh in dry dock because federal regulators say their fittings might taint drinking water with
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:08.320]  lead got a last lead smelting plant in the us it's a very important metal for a lot of natural uses
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:14.320]  is it's been shut down so you can't even get bullets but they allow lead in the food from
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:20.320]  china just no lead in food produced here and i'm talking microscopic amounts you can't have here
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:25.840]  you can just ship it in at thousands of times that again everything is meant to shut us down
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:31.440]  shut us down shut america down because remember the globalist they're all above the law they're
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:38.400]  all exempt this is what their neo feudalism is under a technological tyranny a technocracy and
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:44.880]  that leads us now to our guest will be with us uh for the balance of the hour and then the top
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:50.880]  former um secret service agent he was the the head of operations when when uh the president would
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:56.640]  go overseas dan bongina is going to join us the lot of key intel uh at the start of the next hour
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:01.360]  and then we'll take phone calls the last 30 minutes or so i promise uh but patrick wood i was familiar
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:07.840]  with his writings and work from news with views dot com and other places but i heard him for an
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:16.000]  hour on dr stan monteev a few nights ago and uh i've read the technotronic age i've read um
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:23.040]  the anglo-american establishment i've read quickly's books i've read brazinski's books i i read
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:28.000]  council on farm relations publications and so i knew everything was saying was accurate but
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  he knew stuff i didn't know and i went looked it up and it was accurate so i wanted to get him on
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:39.200]  because um he is an editor of a weekly financial analysis service findings and forecast uh he has
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:44.560]  studied elite globalization policies which need to do to understand economics since the late 70s
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:50.720]  when he partnered with the late anthony c sutton who was a listener and been on the show to co-author
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:55.920]  trilaterals over washington volumes one and two he remains a leading expert on the elitist
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:00.320]  trilateral commission their policies and achievements in creating their self-proclaimed
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:04.560]  new international economic order he is also leading expert on historic and modern
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:09.520]  technocracy which plays a prominent role in current world affairs that says it uh
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:16.720]  you know lightly an economist by education a financial analyst and writer by profession
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:23.040]  an american constitutionalist by choice wood holds a biblical worldview he has a deep historical
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:28.400]  insight into the modern attacks on sovereignty property rights and personal freedom such attacks
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:35.760]  are the epitome and by the implementation of un policies says gen 21 sustainable development
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:40.560]  smart growth in an education the widespread adoption of common core two plus two equals five
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:45.200]  his current research builds on trilateral commission hegemony involving transhumanism
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:51.760]  technocracy and more and how these are co-opting economics politics and religion which together
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:56.800]  represent the major pillars of society yes they're taking over all sciences philosophies
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:00.720]  and re-engineering them and i appreciate them coming on we're going to skip this network break
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:04.960]  because i'm behind this is such important intelligence so stations shouldn't be skipping
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:09.840]  this break it's a network break we're going to do this because it's it's time is important uh
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:16.160]  uh august forecast.com is his site and he will be here frequently there's so many amazing minds
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:20.960]  out there that we just you know just you just tend to forget in our rush and anthony Sutton
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:26.160]  of course advised congress discovered all the documents at the ford foundation and others
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:31.360]  with patrick wood it was a top congressional advisor on the plan to convert america to a
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:37.120]  tyranny how our government funded Stalin linen before him ketler uh didn't didn't run them or
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:42.880]  control them built them just like saddam and al-qaeda and all of it and and understand the
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:48.880]  scientific tyranny the application of dehumanization we give you probably one of the greatest living
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:53.120]  experts because i went and looked into him i'd seen his writings i was like i forgot about
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:56.640]  patrick wood why has he never been on the show he might have been on i might have forgot but i
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:00.640]  don't believe they've ever been with us and and it's just so important a treasure trove the reason
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:05.040]  i'm building this up is you need to understand this is your world this is how it really runs
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:10.160]  it's these are the guys that in congress got the documents and went to the canadian archives and
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:14.800]  got the intel to put out the intel and to post the documents on their websites
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.760]  uh i had something on about 17 years ago and i got ready to get him on a few years later and he
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:23.920]  said i'm sorry i'm too ill but i appreciate your work and he died like a week later i couldn't
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:28.160]  believe he was like on his deathbed was sending me emails back so i just really admire his work
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:32.960]  as well and we need to remember these men that have fought so hard mr wood i know it's probably
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:38.800]  annoying having me gush over you but your intel is so vital to the preservation of human dignity
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:44.640]  well thank you alex i appreciate the opportunity to uh to get some of this information out
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:51.200]  i've been trying hard as you know and uh i always enjoy uh doing radio and tv interviews whenever i
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:56.160]  can well let's do this let's say you're talking to a new audience if you had five minutes on
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:20:00.480]  national tv which this basically is now three million people right now conservatively watching
[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:06.480]  and listening how would you introduce it to layman because my listeners are very smart very informed
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:11.360]  but they always want to give stuff to their family and so they want it crystallized give us the
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:18.560]  basic overview and then get into the nuts and bolts of technocracy well it's really a you know
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:25.520]  it's a complex and a deep topic but basically the first idea is us the problems we've been having
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:31.520]  in the last 35 to 40 years especially have been economic in nature rather than political and
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:36.240]  there's a lot of emphasis in the public uh you like to the tea parties and the conservative
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:43.200]  movement and even in liberal circles as well that the world revolves around politics uh that is
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:49.680]  arguing in congress and uh you know fighting with the executive branch and so on it and um my studies
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:55.520]  on the trilateral commission have pretty much pointed out what i think with great detail that
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:21:01.280]  the takeover of america has been economic in nature and that was the nature originally of the
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:08.320]  trilateral commission that was formed in 1973 by david rockfeller and zebigniew brzezinski they
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:13.920]  they said frequently that they were going to create a new international economic order that
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:20.240]  they used up in every one of their early publications we didn't really know at the time
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:24.400]  exactly what that would look like but we had a pretty good idea for meeting the policies and
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:32.320]  they have managed over a period of now since 1973 some 35 plus years to create this new
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:36.560]  international economic order and if we look around this is what we see today alex this is what's
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:43.520]  important to realize back then people criticized us for being conspiracy nuts today we have the
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:49.280]  force of history behind us which after a 25-year period of course becomes history we can now look
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:54.640]  back at history and see that what we said and set in the 1970s was exactly right this is exactly
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:22:00.560]  what they've done we know that the the world system today is broken uh almost beyond repair
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:07.040]  and uh we have to put we have to put the finger where the finger belongs and it belongs with these
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:13.920]  this very small elite group of internationalists that were represented by the members of the
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:19.840]  trial out of commission back in 1973 and ever since i might add and they have influenced our
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:24.560]  government our the executive branch of our government especially they have influenced our
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:31.280]  government uh to an extreme that has literally excluded the american people all together we
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:37.040]  have no control over congress anymore i say it appears and the executive branch is just going
[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:42.400]  to do what it wants to do so there's been a fundamental change in the political system
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:51.360]  in our country for sure but the political system was really just useful idiots for this elite group
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:57.360]  of economy changers if you will they had to use the political system to get what they wanted to do
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:04.800]  do economically over these last years and so we see we see things like the north american
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:11.040]  free trade agreement dafta kafta we say that we see the uh trans-pacific partnership being
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:16.880]  negotiated right now that that is hopefully not going to get put through on fast track but the
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:23.920]  administration is trying to get fast track authority established again um so you know this
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:35.120]  this hegemy has has continued from 1973 to today hasn't let up nobody has identified these people
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:41.680]  behind the scenes nobody has uh even politicians will not write about them or speak about them
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:46.800]  in fact i think the only living politician or politician living or dead that i know that
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:53.040]  ever talked about the trial out of commission was barry goldwater when he wrote his uh his memoirs
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:24:00.400]  with no apology back in 1979 um so this group has not talked about these people are not talked about
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:08.160]  we've been writing about them since 19 uh well 1977 really and uh nothing has changed that you know
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:13.200]  they're doing the same thing today they did back then i i don't know how it's like a summarize
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:18.000]  in a very short period of time alex well you've done a great job in fact i'm going to pull up the
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:23.280]  barry goldwater quote with no apologies where he describes how it's an economic takeover we're
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:30.240]  designed to fight a Stalin a hitler a mal we see a foreign enemy but when it's corporate and regulatory
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:35.120]  and incremental and it creates a global group of less than a hundred corporations and Rockefeller's
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:40.560]  own words uh he was written new york times articles bragging about it uh how they want
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:46.480]  centralized control and how they divide up the world u.s. based companies get the toll roads in
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:53.040]  spain spain gets the toll roads over here uh it's where they divide up the world amongst themselves
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:25:00.080]  and then bring in a technocracy to be able to control the population scientifically where it's
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:04.960]  impossible to ever get out of it or even know what you're in and you dumb down the population so
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:10.080]  i want to walk down walk through what technocracy and the technotronic age is what they're doing
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:19.600]  when because i mean as best i understand it it is the it is the uh Cecil Rhodes plan of 1900 and
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:24.800]  the and the british royalty and their empire that was in trouble they said we'll go corporate take
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:30.240]  down our flag but use corporate energy to still control uh these holdings that we once had like
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:36.640]  india and other places and at the same time we'll export this corporate plan and and and team up with
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:41.520]  other robber barons in the united states and europe that's what bill berg later became but their
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:49.440]  philosophy comes out of eugenics and and malthus and galton and so it's it's basically eugenics
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:56.000]  scientifically deployed through a world government corporate system so it's very hard to fight i want
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.960]  to get your take on that in a moment but we did find the quote from no apologies uh with very gold
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:07.040]  water he says quote the trilateral commission is an international is international again the
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:12.480]  trilateral commission is international and is intended to be the vehicle for multinational
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:17.440]  consolidation of the commercial and banking interest by seizing control of the political
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:21.840]  government of the united states the trilateral commission represents a skillful coordinated
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:28.400]  effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power political monetary intellectual
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:33.600]  and ecclesiastical the churches from no apologies now let me break this down for folks and give you
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:40.640]  the floor america was pretty much the sole superpower by the end of world war two so the
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:47.200]  globalists had to create a fake bipolar world by giving weapons to the soviets to then build them up
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:53.440]  to let us become a tyranny and then share in a backdoor globalist deal taking over different
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:59.120]  areas of the world in the name of fighting each other in full spectrum dominance then they ended
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:04.400]  that farce and then moved on to the new al-qaeda threat which they actually ran to use that to
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:09.440]  take our liberties so i'm basically describing the main trait of technocracy is that it's totally
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:16.160]  amoral except for the eugenics based system that it doesn't even it uses everything as curl quickly
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:22.400]  said socialism fascism communism as long as it's command and control go ahead sir well the book
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:29.440]  uh the book brave new world by alice hoxley um we refer to it in pretty much everywhere people
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:37.040]  talk about oh it's a brave new world that book was written in 1932 alex and um it was written
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:43.040]  by alice hoxley looking straight into the face of of technocracy that was a big movement back
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:50.240]  then i didn't discover the technocracy movement from the 1930s until a few years ago and when i
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:56.080]  did it piqued my interest so much i had to investigate and and just you know go crazy looking for
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:01.440]  information to try and find out what they're all about it was a it was a huge movement back in
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:08.000]  those days had a big popularity a large popularity in canada and especially in the west although it
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:15.120]  did pretty well to ease as well but these these technocrats uh specified very carefully what they
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:20.480]  would do if they could replace capitalism they believed in the great depression that capitalism
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:26.400]  was dead unemployment lines were you know wrapping around blocks soup kitchens were you know full just
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:33.600]  serving people all day long and uh they believed that the that they could provide an economic system
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:39.520]  that would be better than capitalism and it didn't get very far it kind of died out as a movement
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:48.880]  around 1938 to 40 but uh today it's it's had a resurgence if you will sure it's been adopted as
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:54.400]  the globalist management program it has now been adopted by the globalist management program and
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:29:00.720]  the reason i say this is important when we follow the money back in the 1930s the rockefeller carnegie
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:07.200]  crowd were dumping buckets of money onto the eugenics movement this is well known and well
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:14.240]  documented they did not dump any money on the technocracy movement back down and so the technocracy
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:21.840]  movement kind of withered and died after a period of time however when zbigniew brzezinski resuscitated
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:29.040]  those ideas in 1970 with his book called between two ages america's role in the technotronic era
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:36.560]  that apparently caught rockefeller's eye that's right patrick woods stay there we'll explain to
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:43.600]  david rockefeller is a bigniew brzezinski and more these two men you can say more than anybody now
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:52.960]  literally govern our civilization we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on the run
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:56.720]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:29:56.720 --> 01:30:06.720]  the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:13.360]  bromine a practice now banned in nations around the world guess what else is in the halogen family
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:19.440]  fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:25.920]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:32.560]  results are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:39.280]  been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important unbound clean in a glycerin base
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:44.720]  nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family you will find survival shield nascent
[01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:51.520]  iodine exclusively at info wars life dot com info wars life survival shield nascent iodine

[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:08.560]  of research into why even if i had a pretty good size meal that i was still starving and my research
[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:13.600]  led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the united
[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:18.880]  states and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:24.880]  key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:30.880]  be healthy i then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.200]  we're going back to our guests and i'm really gonna try to give him the floor to break down
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:44.320]  the history of this but you hear me start almost hyperventilating when he's talking about it because
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:50.400]  i've done the research i know it's true i watch david Rockefeller on c-span 50 something times i
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:56.400]  read their publications i know out of over 70 globalist organizations set up since the 30s
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:04.320]  he set up almost all of them or his dad did and he's like the omnibudsman of just all of the
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:10.080]  merger the whole plan and then he adopted technocracy and that's the cameras that's the
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:15.120]  systems that's the to apply that to eugenics and and and if you wonder what new york times
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:21.520]  endorses it and why all these elites endorse it the the venus project and and its founder is part
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:26.320]  of the technocracy movement this is you live in a giant plastic concentration camp basically
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:32.320]  with with a computer programmed by the elite the uh the megapolis controlling your life i mean i
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:36.000]  could not think of a more horrible fate we're going to go back to our guests in a moment
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:40.560]  here's an example of technocracy okay bureaucracy as a science of control
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:47.120]  and notice the the the elites the central bankers the last few years have been calling themselves
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:54.960]  and at davos they go we're technocrats that's a bureaucrat with 1984 spy grids who has a eugenics
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:59.600]  philosophy but briefly look at this harvard study confirms florida reduces children's IQ
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:05.200]  out of 20 plus studies conducted excuse me 27 studies obviously 24 for some reason 27
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:13.360]  studies over 24 22 years scientifically reviewed by uh harvard medical school and their top researchers
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:19.840]  and the national research council this is not some sad group they said take fluoride out as a
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:25.760]  pesticide take it out of the water it is giving us massive cancer and dumping us down it is you
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:31.040]  might as well have a chemical weapon it is a chemical weapon the nazis got it from the russians
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:37.920]  to put it in the water that's a nuremberg trial now it's in the halogen family it's the bad halogen
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:43.760]  what is the good halogen that blocks it and removes it iodine but iodine if it's not the
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:49.920]  right type can be toxic that's why we produced the nascent iodine the only proprietary type that's in
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:57.440]  the unbound base with the organic vegetable glycerin from germany made in america but the
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:02.080]  corn's from germany only place you can get organic corn to make the glycerin very expensive
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:07.440]  the point is this is what i take it's incredible and yes i fund my operation with this with good
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:12.320]  products that's an example of technocracy oh the government before it was like this in the 20s
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:16.800]  said oh we we're having all those retardation and problems put it in the salt oh iqs go up 15
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:24.000]  percent here's that study business insider reports on it you see that's technocracy oh let's take it
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:29.280]  out and put the bad thing in and everybody will behave themselves well this product is
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:36.880]  available at info wars life dot com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and again this is why the people
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:43.040]  perish for lack of knowledge something so simple like that and look even if you don't want to get
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:48.240]  our high quality nascent iodine at info wars store.com to support the broadcast or m4slife.com

[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:59.120]  down they don't sell it i ought to be selling it because we got to fund ourselves gourmet salts
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:06.560]  have it you definitely folks gourmet salt i just whatever you do please please research this
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:11.120]  info wars life.com has videos on it and more to explain it to you okay now i'm going to shut
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:15.680]  up it's only got him for like 25 minutes then we've got uh the former top secret service agent
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:19.920]  coming on who made national headlines last week with our story from info wars dot com on drudge
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:24.400]  report dot com where he said look it's worse than you know but he wouldn't go further than that
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:29.120]  i've talked to other secret service that say it's unbelievable we can't tell you
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:33.440]  well i'm gonna see what i could squeeze out of him coming up uh at the start of the next hour but
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:38.880]  going back to patrick wood publisher he's an economist a renowned expose the trilaterals
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:43.280]  co-wrote the book trilaterals over washington with the icon anthony sea shutton who blew
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:49.520]  skull and bones wide open with charlotte israbi uh he joins us okay so get into we got up to brazinski
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:54.960]  who he is who david rockefeller is tell us explain technocracy and then what's happening in our world
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:38:01.040]  americans don't have to like communism well explain what technocracy is communism by the
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:08.320]  elite by another name with them offshore exempt from it patrick wood break it down well when i
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:14.240]  discovered technocracy as a historical study a few years ago it really piqued my interest and i
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:19.600]  said i had to go and research it uh in depth and i i made some you know several trips to
[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:26.480]  secure original research uh on technocracy i found out that it had been skipped in the history books
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:33.760]  primarily because at the time in the 30s randolph hers got so hacked off by being used by these people
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:40.560]  that he sent a memo out to all of his newspapers around the country and told them basically if
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:46.240]  you ever mentioned the word technocracy again you are fired and so there was no more articles on
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:50.800]  technocracy after that time really and so it was a little difficult going back to get his
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:57.120]  information but after i studied it enough it really occurred to me that i needed to go back
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:03.520]  and read the big nipper's whiskey book again in light of technocracy and what i found out was
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:09.760]  alex is that his writings lined up philosophically and you know idea for idea sort of thing with the
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:16.400]  doctrine of dogma that was presented in the 1930s it was very radical back then in fact one prominent
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:23.360]  technocrat wrote a book a public book suggesting that president rosevelt should could should
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:29.520]  declare himself dictator after his election so that he could implement technocracy back then
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:35.600]  we can be thankful that he didn't take him up on that but uh life might be different today
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:44.560]  but when i went back and read bozinski again i was shocked to realize that he was basically
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:51.440]  saying the same thing and here's what's kind of ironic or strange bozinski was at columbia university
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:40:03.280]  at the time well in 1932 technocracy as a movement was also housed in columbia university even though
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:09.360]  the movement got kicked out all of the professors that were part of it stayed on at columbia most
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:15.280]  many of them died there in their positions you know retired and passed and so here's bozinski
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:22.240]  picking up the trail at the same university where it left off basically spouting the same dogma one
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:27.680]  phrase in particular from his book one quote i'd like to read it just because it will just stand
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:36.080]  your hair on end that bozinski understood this but even back in 68 to 70 and i'll have to be the
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:42.320]  first to admit bozinski was a brilliant man i don't agree with him on anything he really did
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:49.360]  or said or wrote but you have to give him credit for being a brilliant guy he foresaw the future
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:54.400]  back then of course they went and manufactured the future after that but here's what he wrote
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:02.560]  the technotronic era and that technotronic by the way is a knockoff for the word technocratic
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:10.160]  so he quote again the technotronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:17.200]  such a society would be dominated by an elite unrestrained by traditional values
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:23.360]  soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous surveillance over every citizen
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:30.160]  and maintain up-to-date complete files containing even the most personal information
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:37.680]  about the citizen these files will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:43.840]  close quote now i remember that book being on the bookshelf when i was a small child and by the
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:49.280]  time i was 10 it was able to read good i tried to read it didn't understand it but i sat around the
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:55.840]  kitchen table hearing all this from my father growing up and that's the internet that's all of
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:42:03.120]  it it was all built and designed to be this grid so they've built a society to control us and that's
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:11.120]  the nanny state that's the close the green belt for no reason and control people set up checkpoints
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:16.800]  tell your kids they can't play tag say the state rules your kids this is putting a grid in the
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:23.520]  name of keeping a safe end that's actually a grid of tyranny and control well the it's interesting
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:30.400]  that the the the documents from the early 1930s specified what needed to take place in order for
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:38.960]  technocracy to survive or to be you know implanted one of the things because technocracy was energy
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:44.800]  based what one of the main tenets of their philosophy was that the price-based economic
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:49.600]  system was going to be discarded that was capitalism of course and it was going to be
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:57.120]  substituted by a system of energy credits or energy currency that would be used to monitor all
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:03.680]  exchange of goods and services in the economy and a carbon-based currency we haven't seen that
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:09.440]  of course quite yet but we see the push for carbon based everything around the world this is what
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:16.000]  sustainable developments about this is what everything green is about this is what agenda 21
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:22.400]  is about you get the idea it's everywhere today and in fact there there are actually articles
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:27.600]  out in the last five years that are there are openly discussing carbon currency but it's really
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:32.560]  in kind of a still in a minor that's right and in england they show the school kids a cartoon
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:37.840]  called megaopolis where the computer tells you when you can go outside it tells you when you can eat
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:44.240]  everyone has their job in the technocracy you're only allowed to have one child this is the plan
[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:50.960]  so for folks out there it's fun to know about football and what size you know jockstrap your
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:56.320]  favorite sports person wears for whatever reason i'm being sarcastic but but that doesn't matter
[01:43:56.320 --> 01:44:04.160]  that's a diversion you read these books written in the 1930s by all the soxley whose brother was a
[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:09.600]  eugenicist and went on to found the transhumanist movement to head up the un unesco program and
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:17.840]  agenda 21 and all of it that came out of the meeting in 92 you really see it's all the same
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:25.760]  control freak scientific dictatorship system under different names it's just that the brilliantly
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:33.920]  evil brzezinski who believes in things beyond good and evil foresaw the gestalt and got the real
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:40.560]  world manager david rockefeller behind it because david rockefeller if you had to say one guy's
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:45.360]  king of the world you'd have to say it was david rockefeller not so much now but he was the prime
[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:50.320]  mover working 18 hours a day to bring this world government in and now his people are in place
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:57.120]  everywhere and he chose the brzezinski model on record and then he integrated it with eco science
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:02.480]  eugenicist model the injections and the additives that dumb us down it's all why our science are
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:08.480]  on record and you realize this is their military battle plan assaulting us and they think we're so
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:14.560]  dumb that we wouldn't get this and warn people and the elites comments to me when i've talked to
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:18.480]  some of the high-level people and i mean head of the kitchens your group on record and others off
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:24.080]  record is alex the public can't even understand you you're one of us even if you don't know it
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:28.640]  and you're going to grow up and see that i'm going to grow up and see that and block development
[01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:32.880]  in the third world when that would actually reduce their population what you claim you want
[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:37.680]  i've got to see that when you're busy funding al qaeda to then blow stuff up to take my rights
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:42.720]  the point is they claim it's all scientific for the better good at the bottom of it is really
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:47.600]  an authoritarian lust for dehumanization and i want you to continue with your presentation
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:52.800]  and all these slides you sent us for the tv viewers but continuing to get into their plan
[01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:58.960]  studying them and working with Sutton on their larger plan what what would you say their real
[01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:06.480]  philosophy was i mean in just 10 words or less i mean what is it neo feudalist uh just haters of
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:13.920]  humanity control freaks who are these people well they're driven by money they're driven by a lust
[01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:21.040]  for money they sought to create a new international economic order in 1973 i don't really think that
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:28.000]  game plan has changed um is still an economic issue it's still about profits it's still about
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:34.080]  manipulation of the markets for their good um they would press out competition and they have
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:41.440]  pressed out competition over the decades um so it's still they're still looking to make as much
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:47.440]  money as they can they have little regard for the amount of money that you and i might make in fact
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:53.120]  the original model of technocracy from the 30s did away with private property all together we see
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:59.360]  this thing picked up in a gen of 21 documents by the way that private property is out and well
[01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:04.560]  sure they want a post industrial world they want to make us poor in their own words uh as a tool of
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:10.320]  control well essentially what they want is just all of our production alex and you know if you go
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:16.960]  back to the feudal world uh the dark ages it was very dark and you look at people act then they were
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:21.680]  mostly farmers to grow in but they were productive they were able to grow things and the land yielded
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:29.840]  stuff it's just that the lords of the land took 90 percent of everything that uh that they grew
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:34.640]  or the you know the animals they bred they were like they were not allowed to keep anything except
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:40.000]  for just you know what they needed to stay alive and this is kind of where we're going
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:46.320]  there's still looking at getting the the output of our hands if you will the output of our production
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:53.360]  but they want it for themselves they don't want to share it back with us so even in the end that's
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:48:00.640]  still a very economic uh oriented you're right and they use our energy to build their little
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:05.520]  castles in the sky for their power trip so it's it's robbing our destiny continue with your
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:11.840]  presentation that's exactly right so vignette brzezinski wrote in 1970 again in between two ages
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:17.440]  he and i quote this he said the nation state as a fundamental unit of man's organized life
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:24.160]  has ceased to be the principal creative force international banks and multinational corporations
[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:30.240]  are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation state
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:38.000]  close quote that says a mouthful but this also has not changed this philosophy of this elite
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:45.360]  group has not changed since brzezinski wrote that in 1970 and they believe that the nation state is
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:51.680]  basically just not compatible with reality and they are acting as if it did not exist so as they
[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:58.240]  move move forward in the world and in china and europe and of course in andy and other minor
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:04.000]  countries and especially in north america as they have moved forward we can see their fingerprints
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:10.160]  and their footprints all over the economic scene and they have used the platter co-opted the political
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:17.200]  mechanisms to achieve their new you know their new economic order pipe drink well that's right
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:22.160]  instead of an economy based on whoever has the best innovations who's the most honorable it
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:28.080]  becomes who is the technocrats who is in control and in their tax exempt under globalism and have
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:35.520]  diplomatic immunity and we are just crushed by total surveillance which is their plan you know i
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:41.200]  would uh you're old enough to remember some of the old green green green people from maybe the
[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:47.680]  60s and 70s with their hair and so on if you can find a green under one of those original green
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:53.440]  people today and talk to them about the current state of the green movement you'll see them spitting
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:58.960]  molten nails because they believe that their movement was taken over by these people the
[01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:04.720]  Rockefeller crowd and so on they were given a lot of money then they were told after they had the
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:09.280]  money well you're not managing right we need to send in our managers to manage your organization
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:16.320]  and basically the whole green movement got hijacked by this group and now has been turned on us of
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:22.960]  course showered with money but it has been turned on us to bring this green agenda to bring in an
[01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:30.080]  energy-based society and as an economic system i can't stress that enough because that's what
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:35.600]  smart grid is all about for instance that's what happen trade is all about for instance that's what
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:43.440]  global warming is all about for instance with with al gore excuse me being on the front of every
[01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:48.160]  publication almost it has anything to do with global warming al gore is a member of the trilateral

[01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:21.040]  don't want no shackles don't want no shackles on me folks here's an example of how the propaganda
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:30.560]  is 24 seven i was in the coffee room this morning watching msnbc monitoring uh state run media and
[01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:37.600]  they were promoting the end of the earth because of the hurricane or the typhoon that hit the
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:43.680]  philippines and saying al gore was right we've got to do the carbon taxes that will save it
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:50.160]  and then just now during the break on cnn they're worshiping ted turner and his far
[01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:58.640]  reaching impact was the headline and how he is uh saving the earth i mean it's just never ending
[01:54:58.640 --> 01:55:05.760]  let us run the world we're saving you and then meanwhile ted turner david ronkafeller
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:11.280]  all of them are on record supporting an 80 plus percent population reduction we're joined by
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:15.760]  patrick wood he sent us amazing documents today if you're a tv viewer we've been putting these
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:21.360]  uh documents and documentation and quotes up on screen we've got until five after next hour
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:26.640]  then we've got uh the famous secret service agent joining us with inside intel but patrick
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:29.840]  in the time we've got left in this segment in the next i want to have you back very soon
[01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:38.160]  get into their philosophy eugenics how it ties into the older globalist plans and
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:43.680]  all the other key points that people need to know about technocracy the system that we're
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:51.360]  going under right now well we haven't really broached the subject of um uh of transhumanism
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:56.320]  and i i don't know that we have time to do that but start getting into it the rockefeller crowd
[01:55:56.320 --> 01:56:04.080]  back in the 30s uh that well the 1920s and 30s poured a lot of money into uh the eugenics
[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:08.880]  movement and it was a very big movement back that has kind of been buried uh especially
[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:15.600]  buried since world war two with with uh with nazi germany's experience with eugenics kind of
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:20.720]  been a taboo topic and hasn't been discussed much but they call an implementation by stealth
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:26.560]  that's their official policy well it is now for sure and back then though since there wasn't a
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:33.840]  lot of money poured on it on top of technocracy uh incorporated uh eugenics was not really part
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:39.840]  of their agenda not directly in any case some of their members were were obviously influenced
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:45.920]  by the genetics by the eugenics movement back then but that was not really an official part
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:52.320]  of their uh platform if you will um they were very economic in nature they were they were
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:59.600]  focused on creating an economy that would be balanced that would be free of poverty exactly
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:05.120]  but david rockefeller wants to use it to carry out eugenics he wants a computerized weaponized
[01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:12.880]  system to dehumanize well yes we could we could see the dovetail uh in modern times where where
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:19.440]  eugenics isn't as as undercurrent this starting to you know kind of come back to the surface in this
[01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:26.480]  transhumanism really brings us out transhumanism and technocracy are like symes twins joined at
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:32.640]  the hip if you will they're both based on scientism the philosophy of scientism and transhumanism
[01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:40.320]  basically sets up a society of the haves and the have nots again based on genetic modification
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:47.680]  and so those who were genetically enhanced if you will will be the haves and the the rest of
[01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:52.960]  the people who are not genetically enhanced maybe they won't be as smart maybe they won't be as
[01:57:52.960 --> 01:58:00.560]  strong or athletic or whatever they will be the have nots and you know basically will end up with
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:06.320]  the eugenics system that can be controlled by push button rather than by edict as it was during
[01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:11.280]  nazi germany and then people will beg to be enslaved by the new genetic modifications in
[01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:16.240]  the toxic environment when it's really a trojan horse backdoor of control that's how they always
[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:21.840]  sell it absolutely on target with your research and of course as you said poxley was one of these
[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:26.560]  uh transhumanists before it even had the term and his brother founded that movement
[01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:30.400]  when eugenics was given a bad name on record we're going to come back in 60 seconds give you

[02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:57.440]  out of town or the next time i'm not doing the show and i have night doing it i want to get
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:01:01.920]  wood on for two hours patrick what have we not covered today that people need to know about
[02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:06.400]  i think it's important that suddenly the globalist the new term they use is technocrat i mean they're
[02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:11.040]  really trying to make that sexy and you know it's not surveillance that they watch everything we do
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:15.360]  they're watching it to make the economy better but really they're just giving it to the insiders
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:22.800]  well you know the the spooky thing is let me read you two of the official requirements from the 1932
[02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:29.360]  document called technocracy study course that was their kind of their bible of the day one said quote
[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:34.320]  provide a specific registration of the type kind of center of all goods and services were produced
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:41.520]  or were used the next one says provide specific registration of the consumption of each individual
[02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:47.920]  plus a record and description of the individual and alex this is exactly what the total surveillance
[02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:53.680]  society is doing to us right now they're collecting all of the financial records as well as any other
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:59.680]  profile or psychographic information they can get so they can slice us and dice us economically if
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:04.640]  you will and put us in you know maybe pigeonhole is politically as well you know there are threats to
[02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:13.680]  their system but this is an economic movement to try and extract the maximum amount possible
[02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:20.080]  from individual consumers it's very consumer centric but everything is focused on collecting
[02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:26.880]  this information to to make this system work this is the last piece according to the original
[02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:33.680]  documents of technocracy that needs to be put in place before technocracy can actually be enforced
[02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:40.880]  and that's why i'm really concerned today about this total awareness society business
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:46.720]  because when they get this in place completely somewhere in knowledge is power of course
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:50.720]  there's going to come a time when they can flip the switch and basically say
[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:56.560]  we're now in control and now you will do what we say that's right it's a total military takeover
[02:02:56.560 --> 02:03:01.120]  the smart meters controlling how hot or cold our house is the satellite's not letting us cut a tiny
[02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:06.640]  tree in our backyard just absolute bureaucratic hell and then the the robots get rid of the
[02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:11.520]  regular jobs and the farming so literally like a Kurt Vonnegut book their plan is to have a third
[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:16.880]  of the population as enforcers and they're going to hire the people they poisoned through the eugenics
[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:22.000]  operation to literally rule over those of us that are informed so it's not even the eugenics that
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:26.880]  they've claimed they're building if somebody wanted really to feed the world what they needed
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:33.040]  what we need to do is increase the co2 content in the atmosphere by 10 that's right it would
[02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:40.240]  feed the world in a heartbeat but when you take co2 out plants can't grow crops can't can't thrive
[02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:48.320]  and people start well see see i would endorse a real open market free uh open source technocracy
[02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:53.840]  that empowered and had us go to alphas and turries but this this this this technocracy
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:59.360]  is a bunch of beam counting communists adopted by robber baron eugenicist that openly are using
[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:05.200]  it as a weapon system and so we've got to point out technocracy is what's delivering the poverty
[02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:12.240]  it's the enemy it is the enemy and the people who have brought us technocracy are the enemy as well
[02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:17.760]  i wouldn't really lay the blame necessarily at the feet of congressmen and senators but uh you
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:23.760]  know because they've mostly been useful idiots and not really knowing what they're doing but uh if we
[02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:28.960]  look behind it to these people who have brought us technocracy this is where the trouble is and if
[02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:34.960]  we don't get rid of those people and get them out of our government system and get them off our back
[02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:42.640]  they will not be stopped and we will never be satisfied you know how much water can you squeeze
[02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:48.080]  out of a sponge this is what they're doing to us and the only way to get more water out of the
[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:53.840]  sponge is to wring it harder and harder that's right that's the plan padrick wood august forecast.com

[02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:40.320]  dan bonjino has told the public and he quit a few years ago because he said he couldn't be around
[02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:45.360]  the unamerican anti-free market you didn't build it garbage and he said look i can't tell you what
[02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:51.280]  i saw behind the scenes but it's worse than you know and that article that we put out last week
[02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:57.120]  with the video of him talking about it went viral via drudge report dot com and we're on the great
[02:08:57.120 --> 02:09:01.680]  site drudge all the time but i mean this thing went viral three million readers on our article
[02:09:01.680 --> 02:09:06.880]  alone it got syndicated everywhere no way of knowing how many it really touched a nerve with
[02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:12.320]  people obama's secret service agent it's worse than people know and i'm not trying to scare you
[02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:17.120]  we only got 10 minutes with him because he's he's he's he's in a gear up for his book about to come
[02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:21.520]  out but he's on for like an hour when it does come out in a few weeks dan bonjino bonjino dot com
[02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:25.680]  he's running obviously for higher office we'll tell you about that briefly but in the time we've
[02:09:25.680 --> 02:09:29.600]  got come on tell us i mean i know you're already getting threats you're getting your office broken
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:35.840]  into stuff's going on i think not telling us is going to put you in more danger than then telling
[02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:41.280]  us what is it that's so horrible that's worse than we know worse than we think at the white house you
[02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:45.440]  were the head guy that ran his foreign trips we know that's the most important position in the
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:50.320]  secret service because that scene is the most dangerous is is when the president goes overseas
[02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:56.560]  i mean tell us who obama really is we've got uh harry linux coming out saying he's basically an actor
[02:09:56.560 --> 02:10:03.760]  and that he's secretly trained him uh 18 years ago dan bonjino what's really going on here well
[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:08.640]  here's the deal out you even have uh new things coming out with the financial monitoring which
[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:13.520]  you're seeing today with the agency the cia with financial transactions overseas so think of a
[02:10:13.520 --> 02:10:19.120]  picture right now the government you know this big government mentality big government president
[02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:24.080]  uh they now have your email allegedly just the subject and headers and the two and from which
[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:30.400]  i strongly with uh debate they now have a consumer financial data from any uh any transactions you
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:36.080]  may have you may have made overseas and the consumer financial uh relations board right now
[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:41.520]  they're they're internally they're developing a whole profile of credit card company data as well
[02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:46.240]  so we're getting into this society right now the surveillance society whereas i said on that clip
[02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:51.440]  which got something like i think even the youtube that 400 plus thousand views you're in a society
[02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:56.880]  now where your life is really no longer your life it's your life which is available for public
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:11:02.720]  consumption at the government's behest they have the key to your personal and private life which
[02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:07.040]  i find really frightening and when i said worse than you know that's exactly what i meant because
[02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:11.840]  here's what's really bothersome about this whole thing alex um it really doesn't seem that anybody's
[02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:17.440]  really that disturbed about it besides you know folks in the libertarian i think wing of the party
[02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:21.680]  that uh you know that better better raise in the flag here but uh you know like the last time i was
[02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:26.800]  on the show i had a bunch of your listeners uh jump on and and uh and follow me and i they're
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:31.600]  really active and they're really getting involved saying we want answers and uh well specifically
[02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:36.880]  i talked to a secret service agent and this is pretty unbelievable it's true i'm like saying this
[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:40.240]  because you could but i mean he didn't give me anything secret he just said keep doing what
[02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:46.320]  you're doing it's horrible almost all of us are freaked out it's unbelievable obama is basically
[02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:51.440]  worse than you're even saying i i i heard this about a year ago and then from another secret
[02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:57.040]  service agent through another person i know and i mean they wouldn't even talk to me except there's
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:12:02.080]  somebody else's phone and and and then one of them passed a message on to me and they said look
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:07.280]  you're right it's bad i mean what's going on i mean we know hillary had like crack pipes on the on the
[02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:12.240]  christmas tree back in the 90s and and like moussey tongue we know seven of the czars publicly
[02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:17.200]  praised moussey tongue the greatest mass murderer in history tell us like you said you had to quit it
[02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:22.560]  was so horrible but you can't tell us i mean tell us what obama's like well listen i don't want to get
[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:28.240]  into personal stuff because it would be inappropriate i mean it did take a note but i feel the need to
[02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:34.160]  sound the siren here because you know the secret service that there was some uh um pack on the
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:39.120]  republican side of course a lot of the establishment folks tend to come after me as well that took a
[02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:44.480]  shot at me and at my book uh like inside the bubble they took a he took a shot at me basically
[02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:48.080]  saying that oh you know that you shouldn't do that because then the secret service and the
[02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:52.320]  radio it'll damage the sensitive relationship with the secret service and the president alex
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:56.480]  you know when i say worse than you know this fog of scandals encompassing just about every
[02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:04.080]  cabinet agency whether it's uh epa uh the hhs you know doj they're all encompassed by scandals i
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:07.520]  don't have time to go into each and every one of them most of them are public but even look at
[02:13:07.520 --> 02:13:12.480]  something like the secret service you know they were used as some kind of a pawn in this shutting
[02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:16.080]  down the white house the white house tours and you may say oh well that's an insignificant thing
[02:13:16.080 --> 02:13:20.000]  you know they just played the secret service we all inside know what's true we just look at
[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:25.040]  book for an excuse but what's to say later on that you know he doesn't say that the secret service
[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:28.800]  guy you know something the effect of you know hey listen i want those guys you know arrested
[02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:33.280]  for protesting or something and they feel the need to you know somehow comply i mean
[02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:39.040]  we can't go forward in a society where we're not bedrocked some sense of constitutional law
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:44.480]  you know law by discretion and rule by discretion it's no rule at all it's monarchy i mean it's
[02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:50.880]  almost near anarchy at some point so we can't have this it's the responsibility of people like me
[02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:55.680]  i believe to speak out some may disagree and that's fine but i'm not going to get very thick
[02:13:55.680 --> 02:13:59.600]  to eat though when i was part of the sure sure dan i don't want to know about obama's boyfriends
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:05.360]  what i want to know about is is is you said you basically the anti-american you didn't build
[02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:10.240]  its socialist commie stuff and i know i know you've sworn to know that made agreements and stuff
[02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:13.840]  you know to not spill the beans and what went on inside but there's a reason they're breaking
[02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:18.320]  into your office and threatening you and following your family around and stuff they're scared of
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:23.280]  what you know and so uh i mean it's almost dangerous for me to be here pushing you to say
[02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:27.360]  anything but i mean what what else can you tell us when you say it's worse than we know i mean i
[02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:32.960]  know secret service agents went public against clinton and they even got photos out of the
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:38.640]  mousetongue on the christmas tree and the crack pipes i mean what type of weirdos hang crack pipes
[02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:44.000]  and communist leaders on the christmas tree these are screwballs well there's and they're surrounded
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:49.440]  by as i said on another show these acolytes that don't want to tell them you're doing anything wrong
[02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:54.960]  and they don't want to speak up and say you know sir maybe this isn't right that we handled it
[02:14:54.960 --> 02:14:59.840]  and surrounding yourself with figures that view you as like some kind of messianic figure
[02:14:59.840 --> 02:15:04.800]  is really troublesome i mean that's the kind of thing we see in you know third world countries
[02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:09.840]  with these leaders so no one wants to kind of stop the runaway train right now the only thing we
[02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:15.040]  have going for us is the you know sadly political approval ratings right now are so bad his power
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:20.320]  is almost being taken away his de facto power by the minute but the yeah the administration
[02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:27.120]  and i really i couldn't contribute to it anymore i was very careful to not hurt him personally um
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:31.840]  with any you know deeply inside of information and that's what bothered me so much about some
[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:35.920]  of the criticism you know this could have been an easy get rich scheme you know alex and i chose
[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:40.800]  not to you know to uphold some sense of dignity with the office and i don't think they've treated
[02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:47.680]  me the same way in return i even waited to get off of detail to leave the job just to not cause any
[02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:52.240]  unnecessary controversy i've been very delicate with the whole issue and i really so they should
[02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:57.280]  leave you alone and not and not follow you around and make threats and break in your office yeah i mean
[02:15:57.280 --> 02:16:02.240]  but there's nothing i've done uh on ethically or anything like i mean i'm running because i really
[02:16:02.240 --> 02:16:06.000]  feel like there's a very deep problem where there's like we are literally in a constitutional
[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:11.200]  crisis right now with the president just ignores his own fiat and it doesn't seem like anybody's
[02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:15.440]  saying anything i mean where are you hearing it but what is it that being around him freaks out
[02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:23.120]  sacred service so bad it's more than it's not it doesn't seem to me like anybody is willing
[02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:28.640]  to say you know i like the clinton administration where at one point he had you know thick morris
[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:32.480]  yelling but is he like the devil i mean i mean we see flies coming out of his mouth
[02:16:32.480 --> 02:16:38.160]  what has sacred service agents literally running the other direction through the wall like a loony
[02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:44.560]  toons character well again i only i know i think right now there's no there's none of that i'm joking
[02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:48.400]  it's a joke i know i know i know well dan let me ask you these questions we have an article
[02:16:48.400 --> 02:16:54.160]  up on info wars dot com obama carefix affirms obama is absolute dictator with power to change
[02:16:54.160 --> 02:17:02.800]  laws as he pleases even the former head of the dnc uh has come out and said that this is dictator
[02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:08.880]  behavior how can he now claim his own law he'll decide what to enforce and not to enforce yeah
[02:17:08.880 --> 02:17:13.360]  that's i mean if this isn't the first time though either you had the exemption for congress you had
[02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:18.000]  the out of pocket requirements he waived you had the income requirements he waived you had the employer
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:23.760]  mandate he waived i mean this is the odd part about this this sixth sense of of politics on the side
[02:17:23.760 --> 02:17:27.200]  where they say oh it's the law of the land and then they turn around five minutes later and they
[02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:31.920]  ignore the law of the land which the law of the land i would argue initially wasn't constitutional
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:37.760]  but as an extra slap in the face even once they declared constitutional what wasn't constitutional
[02:17:37.760 --> 02:17:43.040]  he unconstitutionally violated it if that's like making your head spin right now i assure you it's
[02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:48.080]  making my head spin too the great irony being the cancellation that they're trying to avoid are going
[02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:54.160]  to be recancelled next year with the reimplementation of an unconstitutional law it's crazy i mean
[02:17:54.160 --> 02:17:59.040]  we're we're and again the word is from a lot of high-level sources is even hitting mainstream
[02:17:59.040 --> 02:18:03.520]  but i heard it from you as well the word is they did blackmail members of the supreme court
[02:18:04.560 --> 02:18:08.880]  oh well i didn't know i don't know anything about that well you mentioned that that the nsa can be
[02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:13.680]  used to blackmail people oh yeah i like that yeah of course i mean the nsa can always be that's my
[02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:18.000]  worry i mean they have congressional blackberry records and everything i mean this should be a
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:23.760]  real problem for folks and again the nsa thing when i mentioned the foggest scandal seems to be lost
[02:18:23.760 --> 02:18:29.280]  in this bigger picture because that nobody knows what the focus on is that the obama care crisis
[02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:34.400]  is that the hhs shaken down health insurance industries is that the epa bankrupt in the
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:39.360]  coal industry completely unconstitutional you know against the takings clause i mean where do we
[02:18:39.360 --> 02:18:45.040]  focus and i think it's almost like one of these buckshot strategies rather than rifle plug just fire
[02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:49.360]  the buckshot one of them's eventually gonna hit and nobody knows where to block because there's
[02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:55.360]  just so much going on right now even the republican party even the libertarian wing of the republican
[02:18:55.360 --> 02:19:00.160]  party in congress nobody knows where to focus because there's just so much going on i was about
[02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:03.360]  to say we only got about five minutes left with you but i want to get into this with you and then
[02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:07.040]  talk about your book in the campaign here briefly i know you can't talk about it yet but i was
[02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:12.400]  in an advanced copy read it total page turner uh it's a life inside the bubble folks can see i
[02:19:12.400 --> 02:19:15.840]  have the advanced copy right here got about a month ago but somewhere to talk about when that's
[02:19:15.840 --> 02:19:20.880]  coming out but uh top secret service agent left because he wouldn't be dishonorable that's all
[02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:26.400]  he said he's with us bonjino dot com dan bonjino he's running for congress but sir i want to
[02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:31.040]  expand on this briefly with you because you're one of the only people that's astutely said this
[02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:36.080]  and i know this is their plan because i've read some of the you know political warfare strategies
[02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:42.960]  the cfr puts out and they admit this that that's almost a plan is to flood so much corruption
[02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:48.080]  bum rushing everyone that it's almost like when criminals take over an area and break the will
[02:19:48.080 --> 02:19:52.800]  of the public and just set the precedent that it's a crime zone that that's what obama and
[02:19:52.800 --> 02:19:59.280]  crew were doing is just just rushing to the finish line hoping that they gain a million miles and
[02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:04.400]  even if we push them back half a million they still win well that's a great analogy the crime
[02:20:04.400 --> 02:20:08.800]  analogy because in new york that's exactly what happened when i lived in new york and now they
[02:20:08.800 --> 02:20:13.040]  stopped it was the broken windows theory meaning at some point you have to draw the line and say
[02:20:13.040 --> 02:20:16.480]  you know what you get caught drinking in public even though there's murders going on down the
[02:20:16.480 --> 02:20:21.280]  street we're going to arrest you too because you may be the guy that's doing the shooting later on
[02:20:21.280 --> 02:20:25.200]  and i think we have to take that broken windows theory to government now and say you know we're
[02:20:25.200 --> 02:20:29.360]  not even going to accept mild constitutional violations anymore we're going to issue congressional
[02:20:29.360 --> 02:20:34.080]  penis we're going to put you up on the hill and i mean what's going to happen in the irs taking a
[02:20:34.080 --> 02:20:38.160]  someone in the irs who used that to go after con con congressional group what if someone come out
[02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:43.200]  in handcuffs over there i mean this was completely out but you start seeing people in the bracelet
[02:20:43.200 --> 02:20:47.920]  walking out and perp walking people who violated your constitutional liberty and people had
[02:20:47.920 --> 02:20:52.320]  testified up on the hill every thursday and friday uh i assure you something's going to change
[02:20:52.320 --> 02:20:57.520]  but nobody's willing to do it right now your analogy was spot on you know before that you
[02:20:57.520 --> 02:21:01.840]  were also a decorated new york police officer weren't you yeah that's right i'm going from memory
[02:21:01.840 --> 02:21:07.440]  i can't think of a better congressman than somebody that's been a police officer with a good record
[02:21:07.440 --> 02:21:11.760]  then a great secret service agent with a great record who went public about you know the fact
[02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:15.760]  that he couldn't morally be there and it's now running for congress and is now having the entire
[02:21:15.760 --> 02:21:21.040]  political system come after you when you have the rhino republican leadership attacking you
[02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:27.680]  that is a seal of approval for me that you're a patriot do you like the ideas of rand paul do you
[02:21:27.680 --> 02:21:32.720]  like ted cruise i mean tell us about just briefly in a minute or two your political philosophy
[02:21:32.720 --> 02:21:38.400]  oh yeah mine is absolutely bedrocked and libertarian limited government values i would say folks they
[02:21:38.400 --> 02:21:42.800]  say you republican i said no i have to run as one because it's a two-party system but you know
[02:21:42.800 --> 02:21:47.200]  you're doing something right alex when the barbs come at you from both directions that you know
[02:21:47.200 --> 02:21:53.040]  guy went after me the other day uh a dc lobbyist former so-called republican you read what he
[02:21:53.040 --> 02:21:57.920]  has to say a man who's profited handsomely off his insider connection so you know you're doing it
[02:21:57.920 --> 02:22:03.520]  right when both parties are swinging arrows at you so well look at the former head of the rnc
[02:22:03.520 --> 02:22:09.920]  steel sounds like uh you know he he's left of linen or something to use that political paradigm
[02:22:09.920 --> 02:22:15.040]  briefly you told me off air i mean it wasn't a secret but you said the new york police department
[02:22:15.040 --> 02:22:21.200]  is really waking up to political corruption now as well uh what's happening there yeah last time i
[02:22:21.200 --> 02:22:24.480]  i think it was the last time we spoke i'd mentioned a lot of my friends are calling me and they're just
[02:22:24.480 --> 02:22:29.760]  astounded by everything that's that's going on up there with all of these these uh the surveillance
[02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:33.600]  state in new york and some of the things you're being asked to do you know a lot of people are
[02:22:33.600 --> 02:22:37.520]  starting to say is this right i think it was just assumed because it landed on your desk and had
[02:22:37.520 --> 02:22:41.520]  been vetted through some channels that this was all okay and people may be it may have been on
[02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:46.400]  tomatons in the past but that's not happening anymore a lot of folks even some of my friends
[02:22:46.400 --> 02:22:50.320]  in the government are starting to call me i'm sure you get some calls yourself and and starting
[02:22:50.320 --> 02:22:54.080]  to question things that i don't think they question before and i think that's going to be the uh
[02:22:54.080 --> 02:22:59.920]  unfortunate legacy of the obama administration just if this trust with government was bad before he
[02:22:59.920 --> 02:23:05.440]  got in it is going to be absolutely epic uh and unfortunately sure so things have gotten bad but
[02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:11.040]  the worm is starting to turn uh lastly how are you concerned that obama will try to save his legacy
[02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:15.600]  get his radical transformation of the republic through uh because you're right he's dropping
[02:23:15.600 --> 02:23:20.720]  like a rock right now i'm really concerned he might start a war he might pull something what is
[02:23:20.720 --> 02:23:26.240]  your gut and what does your intel tell you about the future of obama well it's a propaganda war
[02:23:26.240 --> 02:23:30.480]  it's what it is he started it yesterday i mean why do you think he he administratively and
[02:23:30.480 --> 02:23:35.440]  unconstitutionally wanted to turn the tide on this cancellation thing for your insurance because
[02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:39.520]  now he puts it back in the insurance company's laps knowing they can't go reverse this they
[02:23:39.520 --> 02:23:43.280]  spend three years doing it he wants them to reverse it in six weeks and then what's he
[02:23:43.280 --> 02:23:47.680]  going to say mark my words first folks you heard it you heard it here first he is going to stay
[02:23:47.680 --> 02:23:52.080]  in six weeks look with the insurance company if they screwed you i mean that's a propaganda war
[02:23:52.080 --> 02:23:57.440]  that i would argue is even worse than some you know some other kinds of uh of of actions he take i
[02:23:57.440 --> 02:24:02.080]  mean it really really does significant damage to the american economy the american psyche trust
[02:24:02.080 --> 02:24:07.920]  in our government it it this is really devastating it's very sad to watch well dan you know a lot
[02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:12.800]  about uh criminology i read a lot of it just because it's so interesting you know actual
[02:24:12.800 --> 02:24:18.160]  criminology not just the the paperback crime novels and and you know crime history stuff
[02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:24.080]  that's that's nonfiction but good people tend to be blind to evil because we just don't think
[02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:28.480]  like that and can't imagine it and that's why a woman will get in the yellow Volkswagen of Ted
[02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:33.600]  Bundy you know because he's wearing a nice suit we have to learn that they're worse than we even
[02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:38.560]  think and you look at cloward and piven and the plan to socialize things and then make us
[02:24:38.560 --> 02:24:44.400]  become collectivized and you figure out it really is a plan and that's why they're so aggressive
[02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:49.120]  i mean at a gut level you've been inside there you know what's going on they know this is a plan
[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:53.840]  to bankrupt america and and and basically get everybody on the welfare rolls well they they
[02:24:53.840 --> 02:24:59.760]  can't not know you'd have to not understand basic arithmetic with their goal ultimately and the
[02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:04.800]  Keynesian principle in economics their goal is ultimately to make government debt the only
[02:25:04.800 --> 02:25:09.680]  viable debt to take away the private sector for a way to develop capital for your business not to
[02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:13.680]  get overly wanted but that's exactly what they're trying to do that said that they want a monopoly
[02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:18.160]  right and but you can't have that out if you don't run debt you can issue bonds if you can
[02:25:18.160 --> 02:25:22.960]  issue bonds then they have to get bonds from the private sector ipm bonds corporate bonds stock
[02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:27.360]  equities they don't want that they see the private sector is inherently exploitative
[02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:31.440]  has destroyed the environment so what they do is they run up these massive debts despite the
[02:25:31.440 --> 02:25:36.640]  economic apocalypse we're looking at because they only hope that they crowd out the private market
[02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:40.480]  and you're only having you for investment the government and then they blame and then they
[02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:46.000]  blame uh for the capitalism when this isn't capitalism it's crony insider capitalism with
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:50.720]  socialism well i can tell you secret service guys get an education in economics but you really
[02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:55.440]  need to get in congress dan bongino we'll talk to you soon when's the book coming out it's available
[02:25:55.440 --> 02:26:00.080]  for pre-order now on amazon life inside the bubble you grab it you'll get it a couple days but you're
[02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:04.400]  not allowed to talk about it until it actually comes out yeah yeah i get i promise when does it
[02:26:04.400 --> 02:26:08.960]  officially come out november 19th it's the official release okay good i think you're on that week all
[02:26:08.960 --> 02:26:13.360]  right dan thanks for the time and it's always great talking to you you too i'll take care but wow i like
[02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:18.960]  that guy i really that's a real guy i can tell you right now my gut just says that's a good guy right
[02:26:18.960 --> 02:26:26.400]  there oh i wish there yeah well we'll see what he does in congress and then maybe bonzino
[02:26:26.400 --> 02:26:33.360]  for president anyways the point is is that is that uh well look when you know when the republican
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:40.720]  establishment doesn't like him that that's a good sign right there um look if you care about your
[02:26:40.720 --> 02:26:45.120]  kids you don't want to destroy the country i mean it really gets simple and the reason the police
[02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:50.800]  and military are waking up is that they understand now that everybody can feel it not just intellectually
[02:26:50.800 --> 02:26:56.080]  understand it but feel it we've got the devil looking over our shoulder i mean this is you know
[02:26:56.080 --> 02:27:01.920]  the willies i mean i think i'm getting chills right now i just i think about how evil these
[02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:08.800]  people are and how creepy and how bad and you know if i was in an alley and like two or three thugs
[02:27:08.800 --> 02:27:13.760]  were walking up on me uh acting like they want to mug me this has happened before i grew up in
[02:27:13.760 --> 02:27:20.960]  dallas um i'm the type of guy that just immediately says what you want to rob me let's do it and then
[02:27:20.960 --> 02:27:26.800]  they usually back off and i'm actually at that point hoping they do something and it's not that
[02:27:26.800 --> 02:27:30.160]  i'm looking for a fight or anything it's just that's the only time i can really turn into
[02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:35.280]  ben grimm is when i'm outnumbered then it's man i mean it's like i don't enjoy hurting people
[02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:42.480]  but i do enjoy it when they're bullies then it's like i want to kill them and and and the issue
[02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:47.520]  here is is just a normal instinct of a man to not want to be pushed around and don't want to stand
[02:27:47.520 --> 02:27:59.440]  up for justice and stand up for the individual and i just i just i mean look i when i was born
[02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:05.760]  the trilateral commission had already existed for a year and i was like four or five years old
[02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:09.680]  reading books about the trial trying to read books about the trilateral commission looking
[02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:14.160]  at the covers you know wanting to be able to read them that's why i started reading so early
[02:28:14.160 --> 02:28:18.640]  no i wasn't good at math other things was because they didn't let me watch tv except for like pbs
[02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:23.920]  and saturday morning cartoons we didn't watch television except you know for that or or maybe
[02:28:23.920 --> 02:28:30.240]  once a week gun smoke or something and or my dad was out of town my mom would let me stay up late
[02:28:30.240 --> 02:28:34.400]  we watched john wane movies but we didn't watch a lot of tv we're talking three hours a week
[02:28:34.400 --> 02:28:40.080]  not six seven hours a day and she'd watch the news while making dinner a little tv in the kitchen
[02:28:40.080 --> 02:28:44.240]  i remember that my dad bought a little color tv when i was like two or three and finally just
[02:28:44.240 --> 02:28:49.200]  broke last year how to get that thing fixed the point is is that uh still had it in the kitchen
[02:28:49.200 --> 02:28:53.200]  till about last year it was like a more like a radio then by that it didn't even it didn't even
[02:28:53.200 --> 02:29:00.560]  light up you just turn it on you know u hfv hfc had it hooked up to cable but uh how to get that
[02:29:00.560 --> 02:29:06.320]  tv fixed if they haven't thrown it out there's like an heirloom man the point is is that um
[02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:08.880]  i don't know why i went off into that story i wasn't telling stories about television
[02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:15.280]  oh reading as a kid so i would just look at the pictures in the books and
[02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:20.000]  read every book in the house they had all these books and i remember so early looking at between
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:24.400]  two ages by the by the zebignan brazilian wanting to read it then i read it when i was like 10 to
[02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:28.400]  understand it read it when i was like 16 kind of understood it and i and i think that's why
[02:29:28.400 --> 02:29:33.520]  i growing up in college and just high school everywhere saw everything because i'd already
[02:29:33.520 --> 02:29:39.680]  read all the globalist handbooks that most phd you know economics professors don't i'm not bragging
[02:29:39.680 --> 02:29:46.000]  saying i'm some smart guy it's that this stuff is there it's real and you try to warn people about
[02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:51.600]  it they go oh your conspiracy theorist which is a crutch for their ignorance we're on the march

[02:33:51.520 --> 02:33:56.880]  two minutes man there is all this news i haven't even gotten to yet but i'll be back this sunday
[02:33:56.880 --> 02:34:02.320]  four to six p.m. with a sunday transmission it's always good and that's a really good two hours
[02:34:02.320 --> 02:34:07.520]  informative because i have a day of semi rest if you can call it that all i do is basically
[02:34:07.520 --> 02:34:11.840]  obsess over information and wish i was on air when i'm not on air and then once i get on air it's
[02:34:11.840 --> 02:34:17.280]  almost like psychologically exhausting to cover all this the reason i was babbling about television
[02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:22.880]  sets and not being able to watch tv when i was a kid a lot uh was was before i could read when i
[02:34:22.880 --> 02:34:26.640]  was like four or five years old i would look at the books and look at the pictures and wish i could
[02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:32.160]  read and that's why i started reading real early not even that good until i was about seven or eight
[02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:37.360]  and then i started reading things that i didn't understand when i was really young uh i mean
[02:34:37.360 --> 02:34:41.760]  let me tell you when i was like 14 reading nichy i didn't understand it but i understand it now when
[02:34:41.760 --> 02:34:46.400]  i read it i don't agree with a lot of it now a lot of it is true a lot of it's just basically
[02:34:46.400 --> 02:34:50.960]  repeated by other philosophers before him and plagiarized uh but uh
[02:34:53.280 --> 02:34:59.840]  regardless ladies and gentlemen my point in getting into that whole babbling story
[02:35:00.800 --> 02:35:10.720]  that haphazard story was that those of us that have researched this know it's real and know it's
[02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:16.080]  on record and incredibly important and is governing our planet and taking us to a very very bad
[02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:24.000]  place and i think it's that book i haven't read that book in over a decade because longer than i
[02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:29.600]  haven't read that since i was like 23 or something between two ages america's role in technotronic
[02:35:29.600 --> 02:35:36.320]  era and the anglo america establishment i have read that whole book is it short by uh quickly
[02:35:37.440 --> 02:35:42.080]  i haven't read the entire 1100 page uh tragic hope i've scanned through the bibliography probably
[02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:47.440]  read 500 600 pages of it i don't know but you read all this and they're like yes we run the drugs
[02:35:47.440 --> 02:35:52.160]  and control organized crime that way we control it and make sure it isn't out of control just like
[02:35:52.160 --> 02:35:56.000]  the scene in the godfather where they're around the commission table we're gonna deal drugs we're
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:01.840]  gonna control it it's always like an excuse these people are a joke we're gonna run the white slavery
[02:36:01.840 --> 02:36:06.560]  so we can control how many kids get kidnapped we'll kill or arrest anybody else that tries to
[02:36:06.560 --> 02:36:14.880]  grab kids i mean it's just unbelievable yeah i didn't kill you know 30 of the population in
[02:36:14.880 --> 02:36:22.000]  cambodia but i funded and allowed the communists to do it that's basically a quote or paraphrase
[02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:26.320]  quote of brzezinski in one of his books i mean i went and bought his book that came out earlier this
[02:36:26.320 --> 02:36:31.440]  year i couldn't read it i mean i scanned through the bibliography probably read 50 pages of it
[02:36:31.440 --> 02:36:36.880]  uh and when i went to get it there was some like trendy professor type that didn't know who i was
[02:36:36.880 --> 02:36:41.840]  already getting one i was like oh you're reading this and i think it's like what's
[02:36:41.840 --> 02:36:46.000]  brzezinski's new book the five things the five most important things or whatever it is
[02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:51.520]  and it's all written for the public you know that like semi-trendy's to think they know everything
[02:36:51.520 --> 02:36:56.080]  but the number one deal is take down the alternative media shut down freedom you know he tells the
[02:36:56.080 --> 02:37:00.560]  elite we're in trouble just like he said three years ago to the council on foreign relations
[02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:07.440]  and and it's just so frustrating to then like go on national shows and they go you believe there's a
[02:37:07.440 --> 02:37:16.960]  cfr i remember being on national tv you know like 96 97 98 where they would say jones believes
[02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:23.920]  there's a trilateral commission and believes there's a cfr if you're a talk radio listener you remember
[02:37:23.920 --> 02:37:29.760]  major talk show host with their cook detector saying it didn't exist then it didn't have any
[02:37:29.760 --> 02:37:35.520]  power and wasn't important there it is strategic vision america and the crisis of global power
[02:37:35.520 --> 02:37:42.560]  when i was first offered a big national syndicated job for 15 20 times more than i was making at the
[02:37:42.560 --> 02:37:49.200]  time they told me no more cfr no more fellow reserve no more black helicopters no more ran
[02:37:49.200 --> 02:37:53.920]  corporation no more military train to take the guns you're going to be a mainline republican
[02:37:53.920 --> 02:37:58.320]  you're going to have producers are going to do it all for you you you reach right through the radio
[02:37:58.320 --> 02:38:06.640]  you'll be the next rush limbaugh are you ready and i was like i i can't even talk if i'm not telling
[02:38:06.640 --> 02:38:12.560]  the truth i can't go on air and be asked people for five seconds i can't lie even when the when
[02:38:12.560 --> 02:38:21.360]  lying would help me i had a cop see i can't help it i had a cop remember about five years ago and
[02:38:21.360 --> 02:38:26.240]  he goes have you been drinking and i went yeah i had a glass of red wine big deal he's like alex
[02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:32.720]  where are you saying that this is all just get out of here just get out of here i mean you know
[02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:39.840]  the point is is that it it's just i'm not doing anything wrong leave me alone i'm good i'm a
[02:38:39.840 --> 02:38:45.200]  decent person you're a decent person you want justice we need to be on the same side together
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:50.000]  against tyranny we need to stick together we need to support each other we need to come together
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:54.240]  for liberty folks we don't want to do this to our kids our nephews our nieces even if you don't
[02:38:54.240 --> 02:39:00.640]  have kids other people you have good will for them you know if you knew that a bridge was washed out
[02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:04.880]  you just seen a car caught in it and pulled into the water i've actually seen that happen before
[02:39:04.880 --> 02:39:09.680]  you're driving back to see other cars coming you tell them hey don't try to cross there the fire
[02:39:09.680 --> 02:39:15.840]  department just fished some lady out it's really bad it's not some goody two shoes thing you it's
[02:39:15.840 --> 02:39:21.360]  an instinct to want to help people like i've walked out of a restaurant before it was terrible and i
[02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:28.720]  go hey don't go in there terrible service food tastes like crap now the place has got good food i'll
[02:39:28.720 --> 02:39:33.600]  tell them hey man you've got to try this place over here it is awesome but the trendies i meet
[02:39:33.600 --> 02:39:38.080]  they go don't tell people this is good we don't want a crowd here we want this for ourselves
[02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:46.000]  it's amazing i'll shut up and go to your calls well i'll tell you julio is johnny on the spot
[02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:50.640]  he's reported off and on for info wars over the years he's he's got his degree or he's about to
[02:39:50.640 --> 02:39:55.040]  get a degree in journalism in chicago he's broken a lot of big stories and he's caught i met him up
[02:39:55.040 --> 02:39:59.920]  at belterberg two years ago covering it in virginia and julio i thought when i said anybody can call
[02:39:59.920 --> 02:40:04.800]  in first time callers usually y'all can call in i thought i bet julio's the first one out of the
[02:40:04.800 --> 02:40:10.480]  gate and man he's johnny on the spot julio from new york city i guess or maybe it's a different
[02:40:10.480 --> 02:40:16.400]  julio i was guessing it's a different julio i didn't look at the i was wrong i thought julio
[02:40:16.400 --> 02:40:20.720]  would be the first caller and it's not our reporter i didn't look at said new york i said that's a
[02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:25.680]  self-fulfilling prophecy so julio from chicago didn't get in i don't know this julio julio go
[02:40:25.680 --> 02:40:34.000]  ahead so i'm julio from new york are you listening to me yes i am sir okay and i want to thank you
[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:40.080]  for waking me up as i'm the first time i call i finally get through i've been listening to you
[02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:48.080]  for the last uh about six months and i've really really woken up and i and i've researched everything
[02:40:48.080 --> 02:40:56.000]  you say and it's totally true and i'm freaked out join the club brother and i want to ask you something
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:41:02.480]  because you never mentioned this uh doing my research of searching all the stuff that you
[02:41:02.480 --> 02:41:07.120]  told me and everything i got into health and everything the health ranges and stuff like that
[02:41:07.120 --> 02:41:13.360]  what's your opinion about uh the myth of cholesterol uh because we always been told that
[02:41:13.360 --> 02:41:21.200]  cholesterol is bad for you you have to be low fat and now uh science is saying that no in reality
[02:41:21.200 --> 02:41:26.320]  those studies were fraud no no your brain your brain the solid part of it for medical doctors
[02:41:26.320 --> 02:41:32.720]  is like 70 of your brain's water as you know but the part that isn't is like 90 cholesterol
[02:41:32.720 --> 02:41:37.440]  now now and it's a electrochemical computer and and and i knew this from my uncle who was
[02:41:37.440 --> 02:41:42.480]  in a motorcycle accident he stopped having almost all his seizures the medication wouldn't do it
[02:41:42.480 --> 02:41:48.480]  20 something years ago they said start eating a fish oil fat diet but but and coconut oil
[02:41:49.040 --> 02:41:53.520]  they knew all that and i take coconut oil in the morning i mean it's a brain booster it's amazing
[02:41:54.080 --> 02:42:01.440]  and they knew all this so what's bad is trans fats and burned fat and then all these artificial
[02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:07.920]  fats but they tell you don't get fat eat this artificial fat the artificial margarine that you
[02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:13.200]  might as well put super glue in your arteries and veins i mean you might as well just shoot
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:17.760]  yourself in the heart with a shotgun eating that so see everything they tell you to do is is meant
[02:42:17.760 --> 02:42:24.320]  to kill you go ahead yeah yeah so i totally agree and and all the sugar you know i'm i'm trying not
[02:42:24.320 --> 02:42:30.080]  to eat GMO's but it's so difficult not so it's everywhere it's everywhere sir they want to put
[02:42:30.080 --> 02:42:37.280]  statins in the water now uh and statins on record shut your liver off and and basically make you
[02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:41.680]  start getting Alzheimer's and rot your eyeballs out major studies statin drugs
[02:42:41.680 --> 02:42:47.360]  inevitably increase risk of cataracts yeah no kidding i mean i mean it literally gets rid of
[02:42:47.360 --> 02:42:54.160]  the oil lubricant of your body what you don't want is burned red meat that is a death sentence and
[02:42:54.160 --> 02:43:01.040]  god do i love it oh man i tell you but but i mean of all the natural stuff you don't want burned red
[02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:07.280]  meat but i mean you want fish oil and you want fish and you want chicken and you want coconut
[02:43:07.280 --> 02:43:12.480]  oil and you want other good vegetable oils and you gotta have it i mean i don't know how many old
[02:43:12.480 --> 02:43:17.200]  people i know that literally have Alzheimer's which is really just brain scurvy and they've got
[02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:21.840]  rod holes in their skin everything you put them on coconut oil you put them on vitamins and minerals
[02:43:21.840 --> 02:43:28.400]  they're suddenly back and their doctor always says take them off of that take them off and
[02:43:28.400 --> 02:43:37.200]  then it's bye bye old person go ahead i'm i'm sorry i was listening to the show yesterday i
[02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:44.080]  was on a call i just couldn't get through i wanted to ask the the last guest about the alien theory
[02:43:44.080 --> 02:43:49.200]  because i was listening to you and you always had jen mars on and i was then i started searching
[02:43:49.200 --> 02:43:54.320]  and started listening to jen mars and then i stopped listening to him because i got freaked out
[02:43:54.880 --> 02:44:01.040]  because i was this this guy is saying ten truths but they tells you one big lie that you know i
[02:44:01.040 --> 02:44:07.520]  think james are really reasonable genuine guy he has been as a real reporter uh you know a crime
[02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:12.320]  reporter and then all this uh professor and everything he's done a lot of research and he
[02:44:12.320 --> 02:44:15.600]  knows i mean i mean there are astronauts you know footage and i'm going oh there's a craft
[02:44:15.600 --> 02:44:20.240]  outside and then the government won't say what it is we don't know i don't go there because it can't
[02:44:20.240 --> 02:44:25.280]  be proven one way or the other i know about the emergency centers establishment act but i can't
[02:44:25.280 --> 02:44:30.720]  get people to admit fema camp success when it's public so i don't know i don't know i mean i think
[02:44:30.720 --> 02:44:36.000]  the bible's got it right you know there's demons and bad guys and there's angels and there's a good
[02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:42.320]  guy that runs the angels and i want to be with those guys because the every culture says the fallen
[02:44:42.320 --> 02:44:46.960]  angels like to murder babies and stuff and historically the stuff goes you know so i don't
[02:44:46.960 --> 02:44:52.960]  know what's going on but there's something to all the wives tales is my point and i don't know so
[02:44:52.960 --> 02:44:58.000]  god bless you i know jim marz very well i think he's a really good guy and i don't think he's lying
[02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:04.480]  to people i think he really genuinely believes that uh there is uh you know a lot of stuff going on
[02:45:04.480 --> 02:45:08.480]  we don't know about which undoubtedly there is but i don't go there i don't go there because
[02:45:08.480 --> 02:45:13.920]  let me tell you if i ever see a flying saucer and an alien i'm going to tell you about it i
[02:45:13.920 --> 02:45:23.280]  promise you um my uncle uh before his motorcycle accident was walking from one farmhouse to the
[02:45:23.280 --> 02:45:29.840]  other about 200 yards to get another set of dominoes and saw three this is like in the early
[02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:38.320]  60s it was like a like 12 years old saw three uh craft the color of uh mother of pearl which is like
[02:45:38.320 --> 02:45:45.040]  in the movies green blue orange rainbow with no sound come up from behind the trees about 500
[02:45:45.040 --> 02:45:48.480]  yards away she showed me many times every time we walk up there at night he goes you know what i saw
[02:45:48.480 --> 02:45:54.880]  over there and uh he came running in and told people i just saw something really weird who knows
[02:45:54.880 --> 02:46:02.480]  what it is i don't know people see this stuff every culture saw it they've got aztec uh carvings of
[02:46:02.480 --> 02:46:08.160]  747s with windows down the sides and perfect proportional engines on them that were in the
[02:46:08.160 --> 02:46:15.440]  spanish museum 400 years ago i mean i don't know what that is but did they foresee the future
[02:46:15.440 --> 02:46:21.680]  did a time gate open up i don't know i mean i don't cover aliens and stuff and the media says i do
[02:46:21.680 --> 02:46:25.440]  so i just don't go there we got to move quick now i said i give each caller a minute to give

[02:48:25.360 --> 02:48:32.240]  alice jones jersey on um it's just amazing to me but that question about uh again excuse me a ccp
[02:48:32.240 --> 02:48:37.600]  in origan um i'm gonna do it i'm not a big gun guy but i've obviously listened to you i'm well
[02:48:37.600 --> 02:48:43.040]  prepared now is there some sort of you know it is a good idea to get on that list am i gonna be a
[02:48:43.040 --> 02:48:47.600]  target if i'm on you know you know i you know you you halfway wave your rights or something that's
[02:48:47.600 --> 02:48:52.400]  already inherently there but they leave you alone with a concealed carry and at this point i say let
[02:48:52.400 --> 02:48:58.880]  them all have you on a list uh be be be public about everything um you know i mean if it makes
[02:48:58.880 --> 02:49:02.960]  them leave you alone more and i have one with police they know you've all been checked out
[02:49:02.960 --> 02:49:07.200]  background everything that you know it tends to be like this person's not a criminal card
[02:49:07.200 --> 02:49:12.800]  so it has some benefits i mean it's six one way half a dozen another uh but i don't know
[02:49:12.800 --> 02:49:15.920]  the specifics on origan laws i know they're mixed because i've looked at them before but i
[02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:20.640]  don't remember the specifics uh but you decide what you need to do we got the laws changed
[02:49:20.640 --> 02:49:24.240]  well they don't harass you if we're having a handgun in your car anymore used to you only
[02:49:24.240 --> 02:49:28.480]  have to carry a rifle around in texas because they would try to put you in jail for that because
[02:49:28.480 --> 02:49:33.440]  the law was written in in a ambiguous way just like florida where they're trying to change the
[02:49:33.440 --> 02:49:38.880]  law again so the answer is move for open carry without permit because criminals are going to
[02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:45.200]  carry anyways or for concealed carry without permit while working within the laws of your system
[02:49:45.200 --> 02:49:51.040]  and not get snared in their program does that sound reasonable so the reason one quick thing a
[02:49:51.040 --> 02:49:55.120]  caller called in yesterday and i'm not sure if i'm on the same page here but i'm trying to sell
[02:49:55.120 --> 02:49:59.280]  this to people who think i'm out of my mind and i don't know how you do it i'm you ought to offer
[02:49:59.280 --> 02:50:03.840]  counseling services because i've never been more awake and i don't know how you deal with what you
[02:50:03.840 --> 02:50:09.040]  know but when they sell us to people that be nice on the site and i do this for you if i could but
[02:50:09.040 --> 02:50:15.040]  to get like some sort of glossary because it seems like an analogy would be you see liberty maybe at
[02:50:15.040 --> 02:50:20.480]  the end of this tunnel but there's so many landmines and grenades yeah that'd be a great video game
[02:50:20.480 --> 02:50:26.080]  where you've got to go through the last 5 000 years of tyranny and how governments try to control you
[02:50:26.080 --> 02:50:30.400]  and then you get it to more advanced forms and then you finally get to land of liberty and you
[02:50:30.400 --> 02:50:34.960]  learn it's about you being an individual being honorable with other honorable people and everybody
[02:50:34.960 --> 02:50:40.000]  who's honorable going after people that aren't honorable in a humid human intelligence network
[02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:45.440]  of liberty that's what it's all about always reaching for more freedom more humanity more
[02:50:45.440 --> 02:50:52.480]  empowerment always battling tyranny i mean really it's a process and then the the destination is
[02:50:52.480 --> 02:51:02.160]  the journey destination humanity destination honor destination good destination god it's been said
[02:51:02.160 --> 02:51:07.680]  those who control the food control the people are you concerned about gmo foods making you sick and

[02:54:50.960 --> 02:54:56.720]  wow just just really amazing to see that and meanwhile the democrats have turned on obama
[02:54:56.720 --> 02:55:02.880]  care the washington times uh is reporting by the way adan salazar just showed me an article he has
[02:55:03.520 --> 02:55:08.800]  from the new xbox that literally i told you it sees through all your walls and scans and maps
[02:55:08.800 --> 02:55:15.440]  your whole house for the nsa on record i mean microsoft is the nsa they're even worse than google
[02:55:17.360 --> 02:55:22.000]  i love how google tattles on themselves and goes oh you know say spying's up three times our system
[02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:28.960]  shows oh really it's like darth vader reporting on emperor palpatine or something well now
[02:55:30.480 --> 02:55:34.640]  and i don't even i mean these are on mainstream news articles but nobody's pointing it out
[02:55:34.640 --> 02:55:40.720]  yeah yeah don't show it don't don't because it's about to show it you can see a guy in the room
[02:55:40.720 --> 02:55:47.200]  with the xbox and you see his package everything it's worse than naked body scanners because that's
[02:55:47.200 --> 02:55:52.480]  all those are as they fire out basically high powered radio waves like sonar radar and then it
[02:55:52.480 --> 02:55:59.840]  bounces back and then it gets a feed off of how they bounce back and and so it's a black and white
[02:55:59.840 --> 02:56:06.240]  image of everything and so here's the big news and we're going to break this this is child porn
[02:56:07.280 --> 02:56:12.560]  i guarantee you that's why they've had to not scan people under 18 and a lot of the airports
[02:56:12.560 --> 02:56:17.280]  and and and and at um courthouses as people started suing them going to child porn because
[02:56:17.280 --> 02:56:21.120]  they're saving the images and of course they'll show like some blotchy image where they don't
[02:56:21.120 --> 02:56:27.360]  tune the machine right and go oh look that doesn't see anything and then lie to the public and then
[02:56:27.360 --> 02:56:31.600]  that came out as well the way to beat them on this because it is child porn by the way these are group
[02:56:31.600 --> 02:56:36.080]  games where people can go on and dial in and do this is what the hackers are showing and the
[02:56:36.080 --> 02:56:42.320]  article we're about to post so now by the way they can look at your naked wife are you on the toilet
[02:56:42.320 --> 02:56:46.400]  or your son your daughter you're like well whatever i mean you know they're not going to come in you

[02:57:03.920 --> 02:57:07.280]  that's what this is all about i mean that and they've had top psychologists come out and say
[02:57:07.280 --> 02:57:13.680]  the tsa groping of children is pedophilia training so we're going to have the headline out that new
[02:57:13.680 --> 02:57:23.200]  xbox will empower and enable child pornography the new xbox will produce in mass child pornography
[02:57:23.200 --> 02:57:28.160]  and people all the time will get in people will let them into their xbox they'll go into that feature
[02:57:28.160 --> 02:57:35.120]  and i mean that that's incredible and again that's the new attitude it's a big deal you know the
[02:57:35.120 --> 02:57:41.600]  un's come out the big psychological association came out this week and said now pedophilia is okay

[02:57:47.440 --> 02:57:50.880]  psyche psychological association i don't want to get it wrong there's like three of those
[02:57:50.880 --> 02:57:56.000]  grips but the big one came out and then in the official medical book they said no pedophilia
[02:57:56.000 --> 02:58:01.280]  is good there's nothing wrong with it and and and when you get down to it that's these people are
[02:58:01.280 --> 02:58:07.760]  sick of course it's wrong of course it's evil you deserve to be executed they're not gonna stop the
