[00:00.000 --> 00:13.640]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.640 --> 00:20.840]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:32.440]  well the Republican Party in Texas is running three different Tea Party members
[00:32.440 --> 00:38.800]  against Congressman Ron Paul of course Congressman Paul has above a 70% approval
[00:38.800 --> 00:43.800]  rating in Texas with Republicans and Democrats and he won his last election
[00:43.800 --> 00:52.520]  what was it by 69 percentage points but it doesn't matter the Republican Party is
[00:52.520 --> 01:00.440]  going against Congressman Ron Paul and we have Sarah Palin of course endorsing
[01:00.440 --> 01:04.920]  Rick Perry above Deborah Medina you couldn't get a better gubernatorial
[01:04.920 --> 01:08.920]  candidate and if she gets elected and it looks like she could she's getting about
[01:08.920 --> 01:14.160]  five percentage points a week by the weekend statistically she should have
[01:14.160 --> 01:18.200]  closed in and be above K. Belly Hutchinson she already is in some polls
[01:18.200 --> 01:23.840]  that's being reported about Politico and then early voting starts at the end of
[01:23.840 --> 01:28.480]  next week and then the elections early next month so this is a very very
[01:28.480 --> 01:33.480]  interesting what's happening and it's really an important election more
[01:33.480 --> 01:37.320]  important than Brown in Massachusetts for the message it sends across the
[01:37.320 --> 01:41.480]  country because this isn't a Republican taking a seat from a Democrat this is
[01:41.480 --> 01:47.480]  true conservatives taking over the Republican Party a battle for the heart
[01:47.480 --> 01:52.320]  and soul but Paul Watson has a key article here and Rachel Maddow covered it
[01:52.320 --> 01:59.040]  last night on MSNBC Ron Paul warns of neocon takeover of Tea Party movement
[01:59.040 --> 02:04.720]  grassroots founded by congressman supporters have been infiltrated by
[02:04.720 --> 02:08.120]  Republican Party operatives and that is on record the Republican Party is now
[02:08.120 --> 02:14.480]  running Tea Party nation and they're going up against congressman Ron Paul
[02:14.480 --> 02:18.600]  we're gonna be playing several of those clips coming up today we're getting
[02:18.600 --> 02:23.680]  Ron Paul Rand Paul on next week correct guys that's pretty much set for next
[02:23.680 --> 02:28.480]  week good getting Rand Paul on Ron Paul Deborah Medina everybody to talk about
[02:28.480 --> 02:32.600]  this the good news is the neocons are starting to lose control they you know
[02:32.600 --> 02:36.720]  they tried to sweep in and take over people kind of were stunned by it their
[02:36.720 --> 02:40.400]  heads were spinning for a few months but now people are really going wait a
[02:40.400 --> 02:45.880]  minute you're hailing George W. Bush to triple the size of government wouldn't
[02:45.880 --> 02:52.320]  secure our borders and you're seeing more wars as conservatives remember last
[02:52.320 --> 02:59.480]  year at CPAC the big Republican meeting they have every year with over 5,000
[02:59.480 --> 03:04.880]  attendees Limbaugh spoke and others Ron Paul got a standing ovation and got
[03:04.880 --> 03:10.200]  repeated standing ovations and strong applause when he said conservatives
[03:10.200 --> 03:16.120]  aren't for war so see that shatters the illusion that even the majority or even
[03:16.120 --> 03:23.040]  a large minority of Republicans are a bunch of warmongers so this is exciting
[03:23.040 --> 03:28.080]  and of course we know the Democrat base isn't for war but their leadership is
[03:28.080 --> 03:31.600]  bought and paid for by the same foreign interest so they continue to expand the
[03:31.600 --> 03:38.560]  wars so that is coming up today Paul Watson's key article at prisonplanet.com
[03:38.560 --> 03:43.680]  that needs to be gotten out to everybody on all the Tea Party blogs websites and
[03:43.680 --> 03:49.120]  all the Ron Paul forums Ron Paul warns of neocon takeover of the Tea Party
[03:49.120 --> 03:55.440]  movement and it's got all the videos of himself and others talking about this
[03:55.440 --> 04:00.880]  and the key video that I put together yesterday with Aaron Dykes that breaks
[04:00.880 --> 04:06.560]  down the danger of Sarah Palin that if she is the Republican Party nominee
[04:06.560 --> 04:11.520]  Barack Obama will be reelected now I've been saying that for the last few months
[04:11.520 --> 04:16.560]  Michael Savage has come out strong against Sarah Palin which will be a
[04:16.560 --> 04:22.760]  serious blow to her close to 400 radio stations one of the biggest shows in the
[04:22.760 --> 04:30.560]  country he has come out against her saying she's a dingbat airhead and very
[04:30.560 --> 04:37.760]  very dangerous so that's some good news on that front but first off scanner gate
[04:37.760 --> 04:42.400]  facts contradict Heathrow claim that naked images can't be printed remember
[04:42.400 --> 04:46.880]  the big TV movie star who said they printed off images of his naked body
[04:46.880 --> 04:51.440]  and had him sign them well Heathrow saying we're not even gonna investigate
[04:51.440 --> 04:55.960]  that's impossible well turns out their line so we breaking this down as well
[04:55.960 --> 05:01.480]  and open phones today stay with us this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you

[08:14.040 --> 08:19.840]  battle for the heart and soul of the tea party going on right now and those of
[08:19.840 --> 08:24.880]  us that are true constitutionalist true libertarians true patriots are
[08:24.880 --> 08:30.200]  beginning to gain ground sure smooth talking high-powered Glenn Beck and
[08:30.200 --> 08:34.800]  Sarah Palin and Dick army swooped in and for to taking it over about eight
[08:34.800 --> 08:39.720]  months ago but there's now a giant backlash to that I remember a year ago
[08:39.720 --> 08:43.720]  every time Rick Perry or Cornyn the senator here in Texas gave a speech in
[08:43.720 --> 08:47.360]  a tea party they boot him off the stage they should have in their own meetings
[08:47.360 --> 08:50.680]  and calling it tea parties and sending out letters to all the neocon
[08:50.680 --> 08:55.240]  supporters and that's fine if they want to have their own big government pro war
[08:55.240 --> 09:01.600]  North American Union open borders party they can have it but they don't need to
[09:01.600 --> 09:05.480]  call it the tea party but I like the listeners idea from yesterday we need to
[09:05.480 --> 09:11.280]  found the coffee party to take the tea parties back wake up the tea party
[09:11.280 --> 09:22.080]  people that are still asleep with a big hot container of boiling black coffee a
[09:22.080 --> 09:28.520]  big old pitcher of black boiling coffee to wake their hind ends up immediately
[09:28.520 --> 09:32.920]  so we're going to be discussing that coming up in the next hour in detail
[09:32.920 --> 09:37.600]  I'm going to play several videos slash audio clips with Ron Paul breaking this
[09:37.600 --> 09:42.320]  down and others you got to love it the father of the tea party movement Ron
[09:42.320 --> 09:49.720]  Paul there's no doubt about that from 2007 and there's no doubt that Madel and
[09:49.720 --> 09:54.320]  MSNBC are trying to drive a wedge here instead we need to point out that as
[09:54.320 --> 09:58.120]  the Republicans that have engaged in the takeover but they did go back and play
[09:58.120 --> 10:05.520]  the videos of 2007 with tea party marches for Ron Paul organized by this
[10:05.520 --> 10:10.880]  radio show and many others and so this is exciting what is happening will open
[10:10.880 --> 10:16.680]  the phones up throughout this hour on that subject and a host of other news
[10:16.680 --> 10:23.600]  items we also have the war card with Iran being played they're suggesting
[10:23.600 --> 10:28.040]  Obama play it and he is playing it with all these new sanctions and moving
[10:28.040 --> 10:31.880]  troops and missile cruisers into the area openly saying they may strike Iran
[10:31.880 --> 10:35.840]  telling China they better get on board with it or the US will put sanctions on
[10:35.840 --> 10:40.640]  them China threatening to dump US bonds and drive our economy deeper into
[10:40.640 --> 10:46.200]  depression I mean things are heating up globally and in every geopolitical
[10:46.200 --> 10:52.480]  sector also I have other incredible stories like this one here out of the UK
[10:52.480 --> 10:58.120]  Daily Mail Tony Blair attacks Iraq Inquiry as part of Britain's obsession
[10:58.120 --> 11:03.280]  with conspiracy theories well they have the White House memo they have the
[11:03.280 --> 11:07.080]  Downing Street memo when meetings in England at 10 Downing Street and in the
[11:07.080 --> 11:12.040]  White House with Bush and Blair saying we know he doesn't have WMD's in 2002
[11:12.040 --> 11:17.640]  2003 one meeting was in 2001 2003 one of them three weeks before the attack in
[11:17.640 --> 11:24.320]  March but March 15th the Ides of March where they said we could fly a plane low
[11:24.320 --> 11:30.480]  and try to get it shot down painted up as the UN we could you know stage other
[11:30.480 --> 11:33.600]  events we've got to put out fake intelligence we're going to war
[11:33.600 --> 11:38.600]  regardless that's not a conspiracy theory it's not a conspiracy theory that
[11:38.600 --> 11:43.640]  the court is finding that it was all based on a fraud the line but that's
[11:43.640 --> 11:48.080]  what Al Gore does Al Gore gets up before the Congress and says it's a conspiracy
[11:48.080 --> 11:53.640]  theory that any scientists disagree that man is causing global warming or that
[11:53.640 --> 11:57.520]  we're even having global warming he says the science is settled all
[11:57.520 --> 12:03.200]  scientists agree no one disagrees the last time he testified a week before
[12:03.200 --> 12:08.000]  had been all over the news that 31,000 plus signatures is now over 40,000 had
[12:08.000 --> 12:12.760]  been sent by top scientists in the US alone climatologist hydrologist
[12:12.760 --> 12:18.880]  meteorologist to the Congress and to Gore and they weren't allowed to testify
[12:18.880 --> 12:22.920]  and he gets up there and says well that's a conspiracy theory that anybody
[12:22.920 --> 12:28.680]  disagrees you know there's people who believe we didn't land on the moon we
[12:28.680 --> 12:35.320]  cover all that and fall the Republic Tony Blair attacks Iraq inquiry as part of
[12:35.320 --> 12:43.560]  Britain's obsession with conspiracy theories Tony Blair yesterday launched
[12:43.560 --> 12:47.440]  an extraordinary attack on the Iraq inquiry as the chairman warned that he
[12:47.440 --> 12:53.040]  and others could be recalled over gaps in the evidence recall to testify for
[12:53.040 --> 12:58.080]  lies in an outspoken interview in the US the former prime minister dismissed the
[12:58.080 --> 13:05.360]  inquiry as part of a continual desire to sort of uncover some great
[13:05.360 --> 13:10.160]  conspiracy that's a quote speaking on Fox News he said critics of the war were
[13:10.160 --> 13:16.040]  obsessed with conspiracy theories oh so it's a conspiracy theory that you lied
[13:16.040 --> 13:22.280]  about WMD's premeditatedly that's admitted sir speaking on Fox News he
[13:22.280 --> 13:26.400]  said critics of the war were obsessed with conspiracy theories and asked to
[13:26.400 --> 13:31.840]  accept that his motives were genuine ask why the inquiry was being held he said
[13:31.840 --> 13:36.480]  there's always got to be a scandal as to why you hold your view there's got to be
[13:36.480 --> 13:42.120]  some conspiracy behind it quote some great you know deceit that's going on
[13:42.120 --> 13:45.720]  and people just find it hard to understand that it's impossible to
[13:45.720 --> 13:49.640]  people to have different points of view and hold them reasonably for general
[13:49.640 --> 13:59.440]  reasons it's not a point of view Blair the Nigerian yellow cake uranium or
[13:59.440 --> 14:05.640]  Niger uranium the aluminum tubes the nuclear weapons plants all of it made
[14:05.640 --> 14:13.480]  up the magnetic pulse weapons made up the rail guns made up the attacks on
[14:13.480 --> 14:20.440]  England coming in 45 minutes made up everyone knows the WMD story was made
[14:20.440 --> 14:25.840]  up everyone knows that it's admitted the White House has admitted it but Tony
[14:25.840 --> 14:33.720]  Blair just says it is a conspiracy theory and that's what the term
[14:33.720 --> 14:37.400]  conspiracy theory now means you know the media for a long time tried to mix in
[14:37.400 --> 14:42.040]  UFOs and an abominable snowman and Bigfoot in with the Federal Reserve being
[14:42.040 --> 14:47.880]  private and the murder of JFK by the CIA they would try to mix in things that
[14:47.880 --> 14:53.680]  couldn't be proven or were fanciful or fiction or ridiculous or absurdist in
[14:53.680 --> 14:57.560]  with real documented events but that hasn't worked for them so then they
[14:57.560 --> 15:01.080]  just deny that there was any government corruption and they denied that there
[15:01.080 --> 15:04.880]  was a council on foreign relations or a Bilderberg group the Rothschilds didn't
[15:04.880 --> 15:09.160]  even exist there was no call for world government it didn't matter if you could
[15:09.160 --> 15:12.240]  have hundreds of books written by world leaders calling for world government
[15:12.240 --> 15:15.760]  didn't matter how many UN documents you had didn't matter how many council on
[15:15.760 --> 15:21.120]  foreign relations publications said it it didn't exist you were crazy and you
[15:21.120 --> 15:24.920]  see Cass Sunstein at the White House boiling it down he said if you say
[15:24.920 --> 15:28.880]  man-made global warming isn't real we will arrest you we will make it
[15:28.880 --> 15:34.720]  illegal if you think sunlight's good for you it's illegal he picked some of the
[15:34.720 --> 15:39.960]  most broad things that the majority now over 70% major polls believe man-made
[15:39.960 --> 15:43.920]  global warming is a fraud the science shows it 70% of you you're crazy need
[15:43.920 --> 15:50.040]  to be arrested oh you think a little bit of sunlight's good for you as
[15:50.040 --> 15:54.040]  literally thousands of studies show that you have to have it to produce vitamin
[15:54.040 --> 16:02.320]  A in your body he doesn't care he picks things that are so wide and so mainstream
[16:02.320 --> 16:06.840]  it's like saying if I say the Sun doesn't come up in the morning and I'm
[16:06.840 --> 16:10.440]  the government spokesman and you say the Sun does come up in the morning I
[16:10.440 --> 16:15.280]  don't care if a big yellow ball comes up in the morning it is a conspiracy
[16:15.280 --> 16:21.400]  theory we control reality we tell you what you can and cannot believe you have
[16:21.400 --> 16:27.280]  no free speech shut up we didn't lie about WMD's we didn't try to stage
[16:27.280 --> 16:32.800]  events we didn't do anything wrong it's just our point of view and you're
[16:32.800 --> 16:39.040]  arguing with our point of view no it wasn't a point of view so they're
[16:39.040 --> 16:43.240]  getting more and more desperate
[16:48.200 --> 16:56.440]  and so later we'll play the clip of mr. Blair on Fox News yesterday saying it's
[16:56.440 --> 17:03.000]  a conspiracy theory and then they think you're so weak-minded that if the media
[17:03.000 --> 17:07.040]  and the former prime ministers say it's a conspiracy theory that they ever
[17:07.040 --> 17:11.640]  lied about WMD's that you're just gonna say yes sir I better do what's
[17:11.640 --> 17:16.120]  societally acceptable and politically correct and I'm going to do what you
[17:16.120 --> 17:20.480]  say and I'm gonna be a politically correct Republican or I'm gonna be a
[17:20.480 --> 17:23.840]  politically correct Democrat and I'm gonna repeat whatever the received
[17:23.840 --> 17:30.240]  knowledge from on the mountaintop down to us these lesser mortals and we're
[17:30.240 --> 17:34.800]  just gonna buy whatever you say and you control reality and if you say the
[17:34.800 --> 17:41.000]  oceans red and we think it's blue well we'll just agree with you and say it's
[17:41.000 --> 17:47.480]  red and if you say two plus two equals 500 we'll say yes sir boss it must equal
[17:47.480 --> 17:54.080]  500 it looks like it equals four but you say so cast Sunstein you say so Tony
[17:54.080 --> 18:01.120]  Blair you say so Barack Obama you say so Al Gore you say so Angela Merkel you
[18:01.120 --> 18:10.240]  say so Nicholas Sarkozy you say so and what you say goes yes sir if you tell

[18:22.000 --> 18:26.400]  conspiracy theorist we're gonna do what you say because anybody that questions
[18:26.400 --> 18:34.680]  anything you do is a conspiracy theorist I mean it is the height of arrogance
[18:34.680 --> 18:37.680]  that they do this I I've been before city councils different parts of the
[18:37.680 --> 18:41.800]  country in Austin I brought up subsections of the Patriot Act and I've
[18:41.800 --> 18:45.880]  had a city council person laugh and say that's your conspiracy theory as I'm
[18:45.880 --> 18:51.880]  reading the legislation but you know what I think it's good that you guys
[18:51.880 --> 18:55.520]  just continue to act like your God and we're a bunch of idiots because
[18:55.520 --> 19:02.800]  everybody is starting to see through your facade in a big way so that's some
[19:02.800 --> 19:06.760]  of what we'll be talking about today as well the toll-free number to join us is

[24:39.880 --> 24:47.920]  keep your mouth shut till I'm gone okay there's multiple stories within the
[24:47.920 --> 24:53.440]  main story of the naked body scanner news that broke yesterday Paul Watson
[24:53.440 --> 25:01.000]  wrote his article after seeing it on BBC television and finding a Yahoo news
[25:01.000 --> 25:06.960]  article there was also an article in one of the New York papers we have those
[25:06.960 --> 25:11.920]  all posted up on prison planet dot com and so we wrote an article about the
[25:11.920 --> 25:19.320]  claims of this TV movie star who said he went through and then they naked body
[25:19.320 --> 25:24.680]  scanned him and then he thought they had documents for him to sign and they came
[25:24.680 --> 25:32.840]  over and it was printouts of his naked body and we reported on that and he has
[25:32.840 --> 25:36.800]  been unavailable for comment since then there's a London Telegraph article today
[25:36.800 --> 25:40.640]  with Heathrow saying it isn't true but we've written a big article breaking
[25:40.640 --> 25:45.440]  down the fact that we know they're lying because we have the internal documents
[25:45.440 --> 25:49.440]  from the machine companies that it does save your images I mean obviously how
[25:49.440 --> 25:54.160]  do you think they show images on the news of people's scanned naked bodies and
[25:54.160 --> 25:56.920]  we've had other articles where congressmen have gone to the airports and
[25:56.920 --> 26:02.000]  had them print off the images for them and now they admit okay you can so we
[26:02.000 --> 26:06.400]  know Heathrow is lying about that where this reportedly happened but the other
[26:06.400 --> 26:12.080]  separate issue is the haters and the Cointel pro in all these articles are
[26:12.080 --> 26:17.560]  claiming we made this up that this that he didn't even say this on TV that this
[26:17.560 --> 26:25.360]  wasn't even in the news we reported this from BBC and from Yahoo and from a New
[26:25.360 --> 26:29.480]  York publication it just so happened drugs linked to our article because it
[26:29.480 --> 26:34.400]  was the best and broke down all the different angles all these alternative
[26:34.400 --> 26:38.880]  sites are so jealous what are you jealous for I wake up most of the people
[26:38.880 --> 26:43.400]  for you to then go visit your sites what's the problem you use most of our
[26:43.400 --> 26:47.720]  stories to drive traffic to your sites we're all supposedly on the same team I
[26:47.720 --> 26:52.240]  know you're pulling your hair out with complete jealousy that info wars.com
[26:52.240 --> 26:58.240]  and prisonplanet.com continue to surge but look I'm walking point for you you
[26:58.240 --> 27:03.640]  should be happy I'm here taking all the heat for you but again you're
[27:03.640 --> 27:08.920]  discredited with your disinformation we simply took the BBC report and the
[27:08.920 --> 27:16.600]  Indian news report and the Yahoo news report and broke it down for people now
[27:16.600 --> 27:20.120]  will they pressure this actor who has to fly in and out of England lives in
[27:20.120 --> 27:24.680]  London to retract a story I don't know but watching the video of what he had to
[27:24.680 --> 27:28.200]  say and we'll play it later and going over the transcript of what he has to
[27:28.200 --> 27:32.640]  say that we have printed in the original article and a link to the video you gotta
[27:32.640 --> 27:35.920]  love people criticizing us saying we made this up when all we did was link to
[27:35.920 --> 27:49.200]  the BBC. It's amazing. Exposed naked body scanner images of film star printed
[27:49.200 --> 27:55.240]  circulated by airport staff prisonplanet.com and this story was a number
[27:55.240 --> 28:00.840]  nine in total internet searches according to Google and Alexa number nine
[28:00.840 --> 28:08.160]  yesterday and it's certainly exposing the fact that they do record the image
[28:08.160 --> 28:15.000]  they can print them out they do regardless of whether this big TV movie
[28:15.000 --> 28:20.840]  star is lying and listening to the audio watching the video it doesn't sound
[28:20.840 --> 28:24.440]  like it I mean he's telling the whole story of how he got into the scanner then
[28:24.440 --> 28:28.200]  they came over to him with documents told him to wait thought he was gonna have
[28:28.200 --> 28:31.840]  assigned documents and it was images of his body and so he just laughed and
[28:31.840 --> 28:37.960]  signed it autographed it I mean how many news videos and photos have you seen of
[28:37.960 --> 28:43.000]  smiling men while some hot blonde stands in the scanner staring at their naked
[28:43.000 --> 28:46.920]  body the media lies and tries to say you can't see people's breasts or genitals
[28:46.920 --> 28:53.240]  I was on TSA's own website today at homeland security I sent this to
[28:53.240 --> 28:59.840]  Watson in his own article he links to it we're working on the story together at
[28:59.840 --> 29:09.680]  6 a.m. this morning the TSA's own scans show the man's genitals and show a
[29:09.680 --> 29:15.880]  woman's genitals and breast clearly so Heathrow and the British government are
[29:15.880 --> 29:20.840]  lying and saying we can't record this they're guaranteed caught a lie and
[29:20.840 --> 29:30.000]  saying you can't see genitals lying lying lying we have them lying and now we
[29:30.000 --> 29:34.520]  have Paul Watson's new article scanner gate facts contradict Heathrow plane
[29:34.520 --> 29:40.520]  that naked images can't be printed the government lies as a matter of course
[29:40.520 --> 29:44.680]  it's rare when they're not lying you understand how corrupt the world's
[29:44.680 --> 29:49.000]  governments are we have to stop accepting all of their deception we'll
[29:49.000 --> 29:55.840]  break it down we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[30:02.760 --> 30:06.960]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[30:06.960 --> 30:11.200]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[30:11.200 --> 30:15.080]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[30:15.080 --> 30:19.600]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[30:19.600 --> 30:23.600]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[30:23.600 --> 30:28.040]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[30:28.040 --> 30:32.360]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[30:32.360 --> 30:36.080]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[30:36.080 --> 30:40.240]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[30:40.240 --> 30:43.640]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[33:15.200 --> 33:20.520]  with our top story the naked body scanners I've got a stack of news from
[33:20.520 --> 33:25.000]  today all over mainstream newspapers in England Europe in the US and Canada
[33:25.000 --> 33:30.640]  where more TSA people are going crazy saying they're God telling 14-year-old
[33:30.640 --> 33:34.280]  girls they've got to be their sex slave threatening to plant cocaine on them if
[33:34.280 --> 33:37.840]  they don't give them their phone number groping women's brass beating people up
[33:37.840 --> 33:43.400]  strangling people arresting people for arguing with them charging people with

[33:47.720 --> 33:54.560]  of lunatic thugs now I feel kind of bad saying that but the people that are
[33:54.560 --> 33:57.640]  getting in trouble are lunatic thugs and they are being protected by the system
[33:57.640 --> 34:00.440]  and that's why these guys are getting away with it and getting crazier and
[34:00.440 --> 34:07.760]  crazier and crazier over and over again it is true that when I fly out of
[34:07.760 --> 34:15.360]  Austin or Los Angeles or other airports the majority of the time TSA before I
[34:15.360 --> 34:20.080]  even shown to my driver's license wave me over and say I'm a fan of the show we

[34:24.280 --> 34:29.280]  I liked your last film then I walk through the LA airport there's a Mexican
[34:29.280 --> 34:33.520]  food restaurant and I cops walk out of it we're standing there about to get a
[34:33.520 --> 34:38.760]  table and say hey we like your show Alex so I don't want to turn off a bunch of
[34:38.760 --> 34:43.440]  people who aren't bad I mean obviously if I've got LAPD coming over I mean I'm
[34:43.440 --> 34:48.840]  almost swatting TSA off of me signing autographs when my bags go through and
[34:48.840 --> 34:52.360]  I'm repacking them because you got to take the camera or laptop out over and
[34:52.360 --> 34:59.240]  over again most the time I fly they then ask for autographs so I understand
[34:59.240 --> 35:03.800]  that the most of them are not lunatics but you need to get the lunatics out of
[35:03.800 --> 35:11.720]  there but I want to be clear about that I have only had TSA treat me badly twice
[35:11.720 --> 35:18.400]  once in Bellings Montana and it was bad real bad being shouted at screamed at
[35:18.400 --> 35:25.280]  for no reason I mean I'm not usually a pack rat but there was a free lotion and
[35:25.280 --> 35:29.680]  a free shampoo in my hotel room we'd stayed in Hardin but that last night we
[35:29.680 --> 35:34.240]  stayed in Bellings we could catch our 8 a.m. flight and I was in the bathroom and
[35:34.240 --> 35:38.120]  I just took the shampoo and put it in my bag and the lady screaming at me and I
[35:38.120 --> 35:43.120]  said lady your own sign right here says however many ounces I said read the back
[35:43.120 --> 35:48.560]  this isn't even anywhere near that amount and she said okay fine go through
[35:48.560 --> 35:52.160]  but you better watch it and they were yelling at other people and acting all
[35:52.160 --> 35:57.040]  crazy and had some woman begging to him for I mascara that was completely
[35:57.040 --> 36:04.680]  within their regulations they're nuts and I Anna Anna LA in 2006 I was flying
[36:04.680 --> 36:09.040]  back from seeing Charlie Sheen and working on some film projects with him
[36:09.040 --> 36:15.880]  and they made me take my shoe took my shoes off and then they took me over to
[36:15.880 --> 36:23.480]  wand me even though the the metal detector hadn't gone off and these two
[36:23.480 --> 36:27.440]  TSA guys they were black guys maybe they were racist maybe white guys you that the
[36:27.440 --> 36:32.760]  black guys I don't know and they said oh mr. Stinky feet mr. Stinky feet now I
[36:32.760 --> 36:37.080]  just taken a shower like an hour and a half before at the hotel if I do one
[36:37.080 --> 36:41.320]  thing I have a lot of pairs of shoes I rotate them my shoes do not smell yeah
[36:41.320 --> 36:46.960]  I have a high level of hygiene I had fresh socks on my feet didn't smell and
[36:46.960 --> 36:50.880]  then they said oh you don't like it mr. Stinky feet sort of laughing at me and
[36:50.880 --> 36:53.840]  bulging their eyes out at me and I thought that was insulting and
[36:53.840 --> 36:58.440]  dehumanizing I know you're bored but I'm not here to be humiliated by you I'm
[36:58.440 --> 37:09.160]  not in San Quentin you're not my jail guard I have seen TSA and the private
[37:09.160 --> 37:15.360]  security they had in the first few years of 9-11 they had this weirdo group
[37:15.360 --> 37:20.640]  called Wolverine security in San Francisco when I was flying out and I was
[37:20.640 --> 37:23.280]  watching a group of World War two vets because they were wearing their caps
[37:23.280 --> 37:27.880]  survivors of the Arizona one of them had an oxygen tank looked like he was about
[37:27.880 --> 37:33.160]  to die on the spot I mean literally this guy could barely walk and they were
[37:33.160 --> 37:37.440]  gibbering and jabbering at him in foreign languages and I was reading over
[37:37.440 --> 37:42.240]  the news in case after case of people being harassed by the TSA and almost
[37:42.240 --> 37:47.280]  every case they've got a Arabic last name and I'm not here bashing her up
[37:47.280 --> 37:51.720]  everybody knows that I don't have some thing for hating brown people or people
[37:51.720 --> 37:55.320]  from the Middle East in fact I try to stop all these wars against them but it
[37:55.320 --> 38:00.160]  seems like it's almost always somebody named Muhammad or something and then
[38:00.160 --> 38:05.880]  also have an Islamic last name who is harassing some 45 year old English
[38:05.880 --> 38:14.520]  teacher so I mean the joke is over and over again I see foreigners people who
[38:14.520 --> 38:17.000]  can barely speak English are the ones having their way with the American
[38:17.000 --> 38:20.400]  people but that's what homeland security is for is to train you how to be a good
[38:20.400 --> 38:30.920]  little slave but I'm already digressing expose naked body scammer keep having
[38:30.920 --> 38:34.680]  that Freudian slip because it's a scam this is the first big article yesterday
[38:34.680 --> 38:38.360]  I want to recap this first and get into the big new developments expose naked
[38:38.360 --> 38:45.480]  body scanner images of film star printed and circulated by airport staff
[38:45.480 --> 38:50.640]  authorities claim that virtual strip search pitchers immediately destroyed
[38:50.640 --> 38:58.320]  proven fraudulent use of devices need to be halted now we got emails from Heathrow
[38:58.320 --> 39:02.840]  media office this morning by the way and we're busy trying to get back in
[39:02.840 --> 39:06.360]  touch with them and get them on they're saying there's no way to record this
[39:06.360 --> 39:15.120]  there's no way to say but there's no way this is true really really just like it
[39:15.120 --> 39:18.240]  was no way a smart dress man without a passport got the underwear bomber on the
[39:18.240 --> 39:22.680]  plane in Amsterdam now it's admitted just like there was no way somebody else
[39:22.680 --> 39:25.880]  got pulled off the plane in Detroit with reportedly with a bomb and they lied
[39:25.880 --> 39:31.160]  about it and later admitted it like that I mean there's no way that was a lie we
[39:31.160 --> 39:35.280]  know you're lying we know we have the specs of the two different machines that
[39:35.280 --> 39:40.640]  are sold there's only two different ones two different types of scanners and go
[39:40.640 --> 39:43.720]  to the TSA website and reading go to the British website and read it's only two
[39:43.720 --> 39:49.760]  companies we know you can record so the fact that you do record and do save it
[39:49.760 --> 39:54.360]  and that you're saying you can't and it's impossible you're caught lying right
[39:54.360 --> 40:00.640]  there claims on behalf of authorities that naked body scanner images are
[40:00.640 --> 40:04.240]  immediately destroyed after passengers pass through new x-ray backscatter
[40:04.240 --> 40:08.120]  devices have been proven fraudulent that was revealed that naked images of
[40:08.120 --> 40:18.720]  an Indian film star Khan how to pronounce his first name Shah Raka Khan guys how
[40:18.720 --> 40:27.560]  do you pronounce that Shah Rukh Khan Shah Rukh Khan Indian film star Shah Rukh
[40:27.560 --> 40:34.640]  Khan were printed out and circulated by airport staff at Heathrow in London UK
[40:34.640 --> 40:41.600]  transport secretary Lord Adonis said this week that the images produced by the
[40:41.600 --> 40:44.640]  scanners were deleted immediately also now they're admitting they at least have
[40:44.640 --> 40:48.360]  images and airport staff carried out the procedure are fully trained and
[40:48.360 --> 40:52.000]  supervised it is very important to stress that the images which are captured by
[40:52.000 --> 40:55.200]  body scanners are immediately deleted after the passenger has gone through the
[40:55.200 --> 41:00.800]  body scanner unless they want to keep him he told the London Indian standard he
[41:00.800 --> 41:04.040]  was forced to address privacy concerns following reports that the images
[41:04.040 --> 41:07.960]  produced by the scanners broke child pornography laws in the UK when the
[41:07.960 --> 41:11.960]  scanners were first introduced it was also speculated the images of famous
[41:11.960 --> 41:16.040]  people would be ripe for abuse as the pictures produced by the devices make
[41:16.040 --> 41:21.640]  genitals eerily visible according to journalists who have investigated trials
[41:21.640 --> 41:26.080]  of the technology however the transport secretary's assurances were demolished
[41:26.080 --> 41:30.880]  after it was revealed on the BBC's see our article had all these sources and
[41:30.880 --> 41:40.880]  links Jonathan Ross show Friday that Indian actor Khan had passed through a
[41:40.880 --> 41:44.560]  body scan and later had the image of his naked body printed out and circulated
[41:44.560 --> 41:49.440]  by Heathrow security staff here's a quote I was in London recently going
[41:49.440 --> 41:54.240]  through the airport and these new machines have come up with the body
[41:54.240 --> 41:59.080]  scans you've got to see them it makes you embarrassed if you're not well
[41:59.080 --> 42:02.800]  endowed said con referring to how the scans produced clear images of a
[42:02.800 --> 42:06.680]  person's generals you walk into the machine quote you walk into the machine
[42:06.680 --> 42:11.040]  and everything the whole hell out of your body comes out he said quote I was a
[42:11.040 --> 42:16.120]  little scared something happens inside the scans and I came out then I saw
[42:16.120 --> 42:20.120]  these girls they had these printouts I looked at them I thought they were some
[42:20.120 --> 42:25.920]  forms you had to fill I said give them to me and you could see everything
[42:25.920 --> 42:32.560]  inside so I autographed them for them said con the story was carried by Yahoo
[42:32.560 --> 42:45.280]  news under the headline Sean Ruka signs off sexy body scan printouts at Heathrow
[42:45.280 --> 42:50.200]  I guess that's one of his stage names cons referenced to girls with
[42:50.200 --> 42:54.120]  printouts of his naked body scan can only refer to female airport security
[42:54.120 --> 42:59.640]  staff responsible for processing images produced by the scanners and again the
[42:59.640 --> 43:03.560]  New York news is calling Heathrow liars today about this signal lying like we
[43:03.560 --> 43:09.000]  are professionals who are supposed to instantly delete the images according to
[43:09.000 --> 43:12.160]  the head of transportation the revelations that airport security
[43:12.160 --> 43:16.120]  staff are completely abusing any notion of the professionalism promised by
[43:16.120 --> 43:20.160]  authorities by printing out circulating images of naked body scans should set
[43:20.160 --> 43:27.680]  alarm bells ringing especially in light of the fact that such images of minors
[43:27.680 --> 43:31.320]  breaks child pornography laws and that's why in Denver at the courthouse they've
[43:31.320 --> 43:35.640]  quit scanning people under 18 British authorities not servants their
[43:35.640 --> 43:39.240]  authorities have made it mandatory for travelers to submit to the naked body
[43:39.240 --> 43:45.560]  scanners when asked and have overturned previous rules that prevented under 18s
[43:45.560 --> 43:52.240]  from passing through the devices within days of the devices being introduced at
[43:52.240 --> 43:55.360]  Heathrow staff have abused their professionalism and printed out naked
[43:55.360 --> 44:00.920]  scans of a famous actor for their own titillation and then the article goes on
[44:00.920 --> 44:08.480]  it's a lengthy story it's got all the links to it now this morning you're
[44:08.480 --> 44:12.800]  talking like 12 hours ago England time they hit the ground running saying this
[44:12.800 --> 44:15.560]  is impossible but they're not get investigated because there's no way this
[44:15.560 --> 44:21.160]  could have happened scanner gate facts contradict Heathrow claim that naked
[44:21.160 --> 44:25.040]  images can't be printed the latest development at prison planet dot com
[44:25.040 --> 44:36.560]  by Paul Joseph Watson Heathrow's airport denial that Indian film star cons naked
[44:36.560 --> 44:40.840]  body scanner images were printed and circulated by airport staff because the
[44:40.840 --> 44:45.680]  devices have no capability to print or distribute images contradicts leak
[44:45.680 --> 44:50.560]  documents government documents that prove the x-ray backscatter machines do
[44:50.560 --> 44:55.000]  have the option to store and send messages as well as actual images of the
[44:55.000 --> 44:58.800]  printouts they are freely available on the internet well of course they're
[44:58.800 --> 45:02.080]  looking for supposed weapons that's their excuse for this act of total
[45:02.080 --> 45:09.480]  domination how do you think they give images of it to the media and we have
[45:09.480 --> 45:13.760]  links to the government's own documents Heathrow today denied the naked body
[45:13.760 --> 45:17.320]  scanner images of con were printed and circulated by airport security staff
[45:17.320 --> 45:22.480]  telling London telegraph the claims were completely factually incorrect because
[45:22.480 --> 45:26.840]  the body scanning equipment had no capability to print images they don't
[45:26.840 --> 45:29.920]  ask did they take photos with their phones are downloaded and printed the
[45:29.920 --> 45:33.680]  BAA spokesman stressed that images captured by the equipment could not be
[45:33.680 --> 45:37.760]  stored or distributed in any form but we have links to the company's own
[45:37.760 --> 45:41.960]  documents of course it does Heathrow are trying to avoid any investigation into
[45:41.960 --> 45:45.320]  the incident by claiming quote they're not going to investigate because quote
[45:45.320 --> 45:50.200]  it simply could not be true she says there will be no investigations because
[45:50.200 --> 45:54.320]  this is impossible it simply could not be true the machines cannot do this
[45:54.320 --> 45:57.880]  however leaked government documents obtained by the electronic privacy
[45:57.880 --> 46:02.600]  information center and confirmed as authentic by CNN we have a link to that
[46:02.600 --> 46:08.080]  show that the devices must have the ability to store and send images when
[46:08.080 --> 46:13.000]  in the test mode that requirement leaves open the possibility that machines which
[46:13.000 --> 46:17.240]  can be beneath people's clothing can see beneath the clothing can be abused by
[46:17.240 --> 46:23.600]  TSA insiders and hacked by outsiders said epic executive director Mark Rottenberg
[46:23.600 --> 46:28.600]  according to the report I want to get him on by the way the director of epic
[46:28.600 --> 46:32.840]  and I mean here's the other issue you know most the fraud in credit cards come
[46:32.840 --> 46:35.960]  from insiders at banks and governments selling credit card numbers you know
[46:35.960 --> 46:39.960]  most social security fraud passport fraud driver's license fraud is people
[46:39.960 --> 46:43.360]  inside the system I mean every week or two I hear about somebody in Texas or
[46:43.360 --> 46:48.280]  Tennessee or New York or Florida or California just gets constant you know
[46:48.280 --> 46:55.160]  DMV worker sold more than 3,000 I mean sold more than 200 years all the
[46:55.160 --> 46:58.960]  different numbers we've seen you look them up for yourselves in fact Google
[46:58.960 --> 47:02.960]  for me guys I want to actually pull one up so going from memory DMV worker
[47:02.960 --> 47:06.840]  caught selling licenses I mean it's just it's literally every week I see it
[47:06.840 --> 47:10.520]  without looking we know what's going on because the government wants to cover
[47:10.520 --> 47:18.240]  up it's doing all this so it protects these people if you look at the actual
[47:18.240 --> 47:21.520]  technical specifications and you read the vendor contracts you come to
[47:21.520 --> 47:25.040]  understand that these machines are capable of doing far more than TSA is
[47:25.040 --> 47:30.360]  led on said rotten bird indeed if there is no capability for the devices to
[47:30.360 --> 47:35.160]  save distribute and print images then how on earth have news organizations
[47:35.160 --> 47:41.200]  obtained printouts of such images like the one below this picture is a print
[47:41.200 --> 47:46.000]  out of a naked body scanner image taken in an airport at the airport it's at
[47:46.000 --> 47:50.040]  the airport they got a printout how can Heathrow deny this clearly the image
[47:50.040 --> 47:54.280]  processed and produced by the scanners can be saved distributed and printed the
[47:54.280 --> 47:57.440]  public has been completely misled about the fact that this represents a total
[47:57.440 --> 48:02.200]  violation of privacy and a system open to frightening levels of abuse especially
[48:02.200 --> 48:05.080]  considering the fact that children are being forced to pass through the
[48:05.080 --> 48:09.880]  scanners just like the government claim the scanner images did not show the
[48:09.880 --> 48:14.280]  tales of genitalia they have been caught again and again in another example of
[48:14.280 --> 48:19.440]  deception that's another lie they told journalists who research trials the
[48:19.440 --> 48:24.680]  technology reported the images made genitals eerily visible German security
[48:24.680 --> 48:29.640]  advisor Hans Detlef da a representative of the company that sells the scanners
[48:29.640 --> 48:36.000]  admits the machines quote show intimate piercings catheters and the form
[48:36.000 --> 48:44.320]  abreast and penises images of the TSA's own website produced by backscatter
[48:44.320 --> 48:49.200]  devices also show the genitals are visible including every detail of the
[48:49.200 --> 48:54.560]  genitals go look for yourself this is on the TSA's website indeed when they were
[48:54.560 --> 48:57.480]  first being installed Australian authorities admitted linked to that
[48:57.480 --> 49:01.440]  that the machines don't work properly if sensitive areas the body were blurred
[49:01.440 --> 49:04.960]  out they look at the genitals to make sure it's focused just like if you're a
[49:04.960 --> 49:08.280]  video person you're interviewing somebody you zoom in on their eye first
[49:08.280 --> 49:12.800]  and or the cracks their crow's feet on the edge of their eye to make sure you're
[49:12.800 --> 49:16.840]  focused on this they're in the training manuals are told to look at the vagina
[49:16.840 --> 49:22.800]  or look at the penis think about this indeed when they were first being
[49:22.800 --> 49:25.880]  installed Australian authorities admitted that the machines don't work
[49:25.880 --> 49:29.240]  properly since it varies the body or blur now and yet the British government
[49:29.240 --> 49:33.880]  still denies that the scatter pitchers show details of genitalia an obvious
[49:33.880 --> 49:37.400]  attempt to skirt child pornography laws which have been violated with
[49:37.400 --> 49:42.080]  introduction of the scanners and don't forget ladies and gentlemen that they're
[49:42.080 --> 49:45.080]  also in the news today and the same London Telegraph article and others
[49:45.080 --> 49:48.040]  saying don't worry we have an algorithm that blurs you out another
[49:48.040 --> 49:52.800]  complete line with plans being readied by the Home Office in UK as well as
[49:52.800 --> 49:56.240]  authorities in Europe introduced mobile naked scanners as well as street
[49:56.240 --> 50:01.320]  scanners attached to lamppost oh that's right it won't be long before we are
[50:01.320 --> 50:05.200]  naked body scan to get into public building shopping mall sporting events
[50:05.200 --> 50:08.200]  and even minding our own business walking down the street naked body
[50:08.200 --> 50:12.360]  scanners are already being used in courthouses across America it seems the
[50:12.360 --> 50:15.440]  only way to make the scandal go away will be for the authorities to convince
[50:15.440 --> 50:20.200]  Mr. Khan to retract his story or to say it was all a joke warning him he might
[50:20.200 --> 50:25.920]  end up on a no-fly list could achieve this objective however unless we
[50:25.920 --> 50:30.280]  vehemently debunk the details of emphasizing the scanners do show the
[50:30.280 --> 50:33.960]  tales of genital and such images can be saved distributing and printed our
[50:33.960 --> 50:38.200]  daily lives will soon become to resemble a nightmare that far outstrips anything
[50:38.200 --> 50:44.160]  George Arwell could have predicted good job Watson on that article oh there's
[50:44.160 --> 50:48.000]  another article to Florida men bleed guilty for their part in a CDL fraud

[1:01:49.440 --> 1:01:54.600]  West and I think it's totally true like the cops out here they bust everybody
[1:01:54.600 --> 1:02:00.240]  for pot and they harass people and there's helicopters flying over my
[1:02:00.240 --> 1:02:04.880]  town in VISTA San Diego and they just like so I look for pop feels all day
[1:02:04.880 --> 1:02:09.800]  long and they're using the army as well and the government ships in the
[1:02:09.800 --> 1:02:13.680]  majority of the drugs and launderers the money that's why I'm for decriminalization
[1:02:13.680 --> 1:02:18.160]  and that's what the film exposes it's all a sick joke just like they have their
[1:02:18.160 --> 1:02:21.880]  phony environmental war as a way to get involved in your life with the Green
[1:02:21.880 --> 1:02:26.000]  Police and that's why they've got their phony terror war and their phony drug
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:30.920]  war it's all a hoax I know that but ten ten years ago all the weed that was in
[1:02:30.920 --> 1:02:35.240]  California was all BC was all British Columbia and it was all being shipped
[1:02:35.240 --> 1:02:39.080]  down here and that was the only thing and now it's all like grown in California
[1:02:39.080 --> 1:02:43.640]  but uh... because all the California growers you know they did they're doing
[1:02:43.640 --> 1:02:47.960]  everything now but uh... prices gone down the quality's gone up it doesn't have
[1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:51.320]  government paraquad spraying on it it's almost free
[1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:54.440]  they're using it to like you know harass the people like you know they
[1:02:54.440 --> 1:02:59.320]  everybody I know that you know have potty my pet friends got the door kicked
[1:02:59.320 --> 1:03:04.480]  down like d a rated people for like for that I'm a friend got a felony for
[1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:08.880]  having to grab the pot and they said that he had a scale and he had it like a
[1:03:08.880 --> 1:03:12.640]  thousand bucks and they said all this drug money and you got a felony for that
[1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:16.440]  for having to grab and they say and sixteen or fourteen years it's their
[1:03:16.440 --> 1:03:21.320]  excuse to put people in prison it's a way to legalize slavery and that's why
[1:03:21.320 --> 1:03:25.280]  I'm for decriminalization people can pre-order how we won the west it starts
[1:03:25.280 --> 1:03:30.480]  shipping out on monday ladies and gentlemen get it first
[1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:34.800]  yeah and also i want to tell you one thing uh... like my friends from china
[1:03:34.800 --> 1:03:38.560]  and uh... one of the best-selling books over there right now is uh... is it's
[1:03:38.560 --> 1:03:40.800]  called a book called currency wars
[1:03:40.800 --> 1:03:44.820]  and uh... talks about how uh... said reserve on by uh...
[1:03:44.820 --> 1:03:49.240]  you know private companies and uh... how how the bank is just like all fraud and
[1:03:49.240 --> 1:03:53.400]  how everything and that's where the best selling books worldwide and non-fiction
[1:03:53.400 --> 1:03:55.200]  or quote conspiracy
[1:03:55.200 --> 1:03:58.640]  but conspiracy means questioning the government anyway
[1:03:58.640 --> 1:04:01.440]  i know i think that's good but i think it's interesting because china has such
[1:04:01.440 --> 1:04:03.680]  a controlled market on their media
[1:04:03.680 --> 1:04:07.040]  that they allow us a book to become their best seller
[1:04:07.040 --> 1:04:10.080]  it's uh... that talks about that breaks it down talks about the family's
[1:04:10.080 --> 1:04:14.600]  raw child boulder bird talks about all that well governments are always happy
[1:04:14.600 --> 1:04:17.600]  to expose the corruption of other governments
[1:04:17.600 --> 1:04:21.120]  but china has a similar cartel running them jason i appreciate your call and

[1:06:22.080 --> 1:06:26.080]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[1:06:26.080 --> 1:06:30.440]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[1:06:30.440 --> 1:06:34.160]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[1:06:34.160 --> 1:06:38.320]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides

[1:07:12.640 --> 1:07:16.440]  solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the first line of
[1:07:16.440 --> 1:07:21.240]  defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses
[1:07:21.240 --> 1:07:25.520]  the respiratory system with your self-produced nano silver solutions and
[1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:30.840]  also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with
[1:07:30.840 --> 1:07:35.040]  continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products you can
[1:07:35.040 --> 1:07:39.720]  now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator
[1:07:39.720 --> 1:07:43.800]  very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided making

[1:07:57.800 --> 1:08:13.120]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[1:08:13.120 --> 1:08:20.000]  cw in texas thanks for holding her on the air yeah alex thanks for picking my
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:26.720]  call welcome just I wanted to point out you know I listen to talk radio fairly
[1:08:26.720 --> 1:08:30.560]  often more than I watch TV because I just don't care about TV but I noticed
[1:08:30.560 --> 1:08:35.920]  here in houston the the callers that called in are definitely in favor of
[1:08:35.920 --> 1:08:39.960]  miss madina and it seems like miss madina's campaign is the total opposite
[1:08:39.960 --> 1:08:45.360]  of of what everybody's tired of big money big corporate influence so that's
[1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:48.720]  why she's having such a great effect but one thing I've noticed they're not
[1:08:48.720 --> 1:08:53.800]  saying is when to go vote for miss madina and that's March 2nd Texas
[1:08:53.800 --> 1:08:57.680]  independence day and alex I was wondering if you could use your influence
[1:08:57.680 --> 1:09:03.480]  or your radio show from now to March 2nd 5 10 minutes just to keep reciting
[1:09:03.480 --> 1:09:08.000]  you know the nlp in a good way to get people to know hey March 2nd I got to
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:13.360]  go vote for because as we as our constitutional movement takes hold here
[1:09:13.360 --> 1:09:17.640]  in Texas and as others will start to want to step out of the shadows and run
[1:09:17.640 --> 1:09:22.600]  in other states and we can help each other become and start slowly taking this
[1:09:22.600 --> 1:09:27.240]  country back peacefully through the democratic process of electing true
[1:09:27.240 --> 1:09:31.680]  representatives that just want to get back to the basics man you know for
[1:09:31.680 --> 1:09:36.160]  those that don't know they've got several national scientific polls that
[1:09:36.160 --> 1:09:40.400]  show her within four points to three points and those numbers are five days
[1:09:40.400 --> 1:09:46.800]  old surging about to overtake kbaby and then she'll just be five points away
[1:09:46.800 --> 1:09:51.400]  from Perry and early voting starts what in eight days if people can't do it
[1:09:51.400 --> 1:09:57.760]  coming up on Texas independence day March 2nd so yes we're you know talking
[1:09:57.760 --> 1:10:01.800]  about just a few weeks from now and this is going to be decided yes so you're
[1:10:01.800 --> 1:10:06.520]  right and and really I you know I truly feel that the establishment is running
[1:10:06.520 --> 1:10:10.640]  scared right now you know hell four years ago man I didn't care about this
[1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:14.760]  stuff I didn't know any issue about this this whole giant thing called new
[1:10:14.760 --> 1:10:19.600]  world order but I have totally been on information overload and I'm running on
[1:10:19.600 --> 1:10:24.640]  pure passion and I think our supporters of miss Medina and other candidates that
[1:10:24.640 --> 1:10:29.560]  can build on her success that she's having here those folks the true grassroots
[1:10:29.560 --> 1:10:33.840]  are running on pure passion and you're right man they're gonna definitely try
[1:10:33.840 --> 1:10:37.000]  to corrupt this movement they're gonna try to provocateur it they're gonna try
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:40.800]  to say oh my god they're getting radicalized no we ain't getting radicalized
[1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:44.840]  it ain't nothing like that well we need to be look we have radical tyranny in
[1:10:44.840 --> 1:10:48.720]  this country and they call true red-blooded American activity they
[1:10:48.720 --> 1:10:54.280]  call that radical CW I appreciate your call here is the bottom line you saw
[1:10:54.280 --> 1:10:57.880]  Brown get elected and take a Democrat-controlled seat that the Kennedys
[1:10:57.880 --> 1:11:02.120]  had held for decades that they said was bulletproof politically but that was a
[1:11:02.120 --> 1:11:06.040]  Republican taken down a Democrat from the beginning of the Tea Party's three
[1:11:06.040 --> 1:11:08.720]  years ago it's been against the Republicans and the Democrats and
[1:11:08.720 --> 1:11:12.560]  business as usual and it's been an anti-new world order anti-fellow reserve
[1:11:12.560 --> 1:11:17.080]  movement and that's whatever Medina comes out of and so if she can beat these
[1:11:17.080 --> 1:11:23.320]  Republican incumbents a senator and a governor in a primary that's what the
[1:11:23.320 --> 1:11:26.960]  Dallas Morning News reported yesterday along with several other publications
[1:11:26.960 --> 1:11:31.320]  that she's already got higher poll numbers when stacked against the
[1:11:31.320 --> 1:11:36.960]  Democratic candidate she will beat them but Perry and the other incumbent
[1:11:36.960 --> 1:11:44.280]  senator may be beaten by the two joke Democrats who are jokes they're absolute
[1:11:44.280 --> 1:11:47.320]  jokes I mean I'll tell you right now I'd probably vote for Rick Perry over the
[1:11:47.320 --> 1:11:50.880]  Democrats they're that bad ladies and gentlemen Rick Perry's as bad as it
[1:11:50.880 --> 1:11:56.960]  almost gets but he's not a gun grabber he doesn't really defend the second
[1:11:56.960 --> 1:12:00.880]  amendment as it uses power to reverse things but he isn't coming after your
[1:12:00.880 --> 1:12:06.600]  guns so bottom line if it goes into a run-off and Medina's kicked out
[1:12:06.600 --> 1:12:11.960]  somehow I will vote for Rick Perry over Kay Bailey Hutchinson I mean she is that
[1:12:11.960 --> 1:12:15.120]  bad ladies and gentlemen and I will vote for Rick Perry over those Democrats
[1:12:15.120 --> 1:12:20.440]  because those Democrats are bad news ladies and gentlemen super bad news so
[1:12:20.440 --> 1:12:25.360]  the only real choice is ever Medina and again if we can take down these
[1:12:25.360 --> 1:12:29.040]  establishment Republicans that will send the true message nationwide this is a
[1:12:29.040 --> 1:12:35.800]  true populist uprising against incumbent globalist Rick in Florida you're on the
[1:12:35.800 --> 1:12:41.600]  air go ahead hey Alex I'd like you to update us in the 9-11 truth movement
[1:12:41.600 --> 1:12:47.400]  what's our best chance for a new investigation and can you pay particular
[1:12:47.400 --> 1:12:51.960]  attention in your comments to the situation in New York City is Mayor
[1:12:51.960 --> 1:12:58.520]  Bloomberg using his office and his money to stifle an investigation yes going on
[1:12:58.520 --> 1:13:02.760]  yeah yes they've got all the petitions and they said for a city
[1:13:02.760 --> 1:13:07.760]  investigation a state investigation they block those the city of New York with
[1:13:07.760 --> 1:13:11.080]  with the feds are now demonizing the police firemen and medical workers and
[1:13:11.080 --> 1:13:17.800]  National Guard who 3,000 have died all the dogs died within four years I mean
[1:13:17.800 --> 1:13:23.560]  just totally toxic asbestos concrete glass pulverized mercury pulverized all
[1:13:23.560 --> 1:13:27.640]  those literally thousands of toxins and chemicals from those buildings that were
[1:13:27.640 --> 1:13:34.680]  vaporized into powder and then MSNBC and New York Post are saying oh they're a
[1:13:34.680 --> 1:13:39.360]  bunch of scum they they just are trying to get money well you know there's
[1:13:39.360 --> 1:13:44.080]  nothing wrong with them medically even though we have the internal from a month
[1:13:44.080 --> 1:13:50.520]  into 9-11 EPA assessment that it was deadly and the White House ordered the
[1:13:50.520 --> 1:13:55.760]  head of the EPA to come in and say the air was clean within days and it came out
[1:13:55.760 --> 1:13:58.760]  a month later they knew and covered it up and now they're doing the same thing
[1:13:58.760 --> 1:14:02.080]  they will not take care of troops from Agent Orange they will not take care of
[1:14:02.080 --> 1:14:05.280]  troops with depleted uranium they will not take care of you if you get hurt
[1:14:05.280 --> 1:14:10.080]  they only want to use you while you're oppressing the people once they're done
[1:14:10.080 --> 1:14:12.840]  with you they're not going to take care of you because we have the internal
[1:14:12.840 --> 1:14:16.760]  homeland security documents who are the number one enemies of the New World Order
[1:14:16.760 --> 1:14:24.240]  who gun owners returning vets conservatives libertarians they hate
[1:14:24.240 --> 1:14:30.000]  our guts because we recognize the New World Order as the enemy but look
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:35.520]  Obama's not going to have a new investigation Ron Paul is called for one
[1:14:35.520 --> 1:14:39.480]  Congress wants everybody to forget about it just use it for a police state so
[1:14:39.480 --> 1:14:43.640]  we continue at the grassroots level in the court of public opinion to make
[1:14:43.640 --> 1:14:48.320]  films write books websites interview guest as news comes out exposing new
[1:14:48.320 --> 1:14:52.280]  false flag terror attacks and so they can't use the tool of stage terror
[1:14:52.280 --> 1:14:56.480]  anymore and so we've effectively done that but I wouldn't hold your breath for
[1:14:56.480 --> 1:14:59.480]  government never come out admit the truth I appreciate your call Rick
[1:14:59.480 --> 1:15:03.360]  Nate in California you're on the air
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:13.880]  okay goodbye Nate Keith in Texas you're on the air Keith hi how's it going Alex
[1:15:13.880 --> 1:15:22.280]  good I just wanted to let people know that I have the video Kathleen Sebelius
[1:15:22.280 --> 1:15:27.120]  busted on YouTube on the Funkmaster five channel it's the video of her
[1:15:27.120 --> 1:15:31.960]  admitting her and with Perry went to Builderberg group it's a video proof for
[1:15:31.960 --> 1:15:38.360]  people to get Kathleen Sebelius admits she went to Builderberg group yeah
[1:15:38.360 --> 1:15:43.360]  Tom tape on the Funkmaster five YouTube channel it that she's basically
[1:15:43.360 --> 1:15:50.440]  confronted at a town hall meeting about it and she has to talk about it but I
[1:15:50.440 --> 1:15:56.600]  thought Builderberg group didn't exist oh of course not it's just crazy she
[1:15:56.600 --> 1:16:01.000]  doesn't exist either Kathy Kathleen Sebelius doesn't exist and Rick Perry
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:05.440]  doesn't exist did they say so nope nope yeah he's a you know it gets hot out

[1:16:12.400 --> 1:16:17.840]  your call we'll check that out let's go ahead and talk to Kathy in Canada Kathy
[1:16:17.840 --> 1:16:25.880]  you're on the air hi Alex hey how's it going good good hey your last caller was
[1:16:25.880 --> 1:16:30.560]  sort of appealing to you to use your your influence and now I'm going to do
[1:16:30.560 --> 1:16:36.600]  the same we're gonna we're headed for travel up here because people might not
[1:16:36.600 --> 1:16:40.520]  know it but we don't have a government right now hey our government has been
[1:16:40.520 --> 1:16:49.480]  suspended it's prologue during the Olympics and that means that good old
[1:16:49.480 --> 1:16:54.120]  Stephen Harper can do anything he wants to if there's a terror attack quote
[1:16:54.120 --> 1:17:00.560]  yeah let me break that down for folks that don't know in 1979 the Parliament
[1:17:00.560 --> 1:17:05.040]  of Australia wasn't letting the Prime Minister grab a bunch of private
[1:17:05.040 --> 1:17:10.160]  property and pass a bunch of taxes and so the elected government of the good
[1:17:10.160 --> 1:17:17.000]  old Aussies all 20-something million of them said no and so the queen had her
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:22.920]  governor general dissolve the parliament and what was it two years ago the
[1:17:22.920 --> 1:17:26.040]  parliament wasn't going along or year and a half ago with the North American
[1:17:26.040 --> 1:17:31.000]  Union SPP expansion or the open declarations that US troops would be
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:34.080]  used in Canada and they now are and they're saying during the Olympics they
[1:17:34.080 --> 1:17:38.880]  will be and so yeah I saw that in the Toronto Star and a couple papers last
[1:17:38.880 --> 1:17:43.880]  week we briefly mentioned it so parliament has been suspended again by
[1:17:43.880 --> 1:17:48.240]  the Queenie anytime the Prime Minister wants he just calls her up and the
[1:17:48.240 --> 1:17:51.880]  governor general the real government says well you puppets didn't do exactly
[1:17:51.880 --> 1:17:55.000]  what we said and so you're under international control because you're a
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:59.040]  commonwealth of the Queenie who doesn't supposedly have any power and every
[1:17:59.040 --> 1:18:02.240]  time I read mainstream news articles out of Canada can Canadians email me and
[1:18:02.240 --> 1:18:06.520]  go well this is just a figurehead she's not really in control oh really oh
[1:18:06.520 --> 1:18:10.280]  really that's just why she does whatever she wants but I guess your
[1:18:10.280 --> 1:18:16.840]  governor general he runs Canada tell folks about it yeah it's exactly the way
[1:18:16.840 --> 1:18:22.880]  you said it and the Olympics were primed here with the Israeli security
[1:18:22.880 --> 1:18:28.920]  companies the same ones that did 7-7 and they've got security for a new addition
[1:18:28.920 --> 1:18:33.640]  to the light rail that heads right into the atlantic village people can look at
[1:18:33.640 --> 1:18:39.440]  we are change vancouver did a walking tour showing possible targets and our
[1:18:39.440 --> 1:18:44.440]  we're missing a whole bunch of explosive material the same quote unquote stuff
[1:18:44.440 --> 1:18:50.560]  that was used on your Frederick Merrill building Tennessee McVey you know with
[1:18:50.560 --> 1:18:55.440]  the fertilizer stuff that's missing up here and we got no government we got a
[1:18:55.440 --> 1:19:00.120]  bunch of explosives missing we got Israeli security we got a police state
[1:19:00.120 --> 1:19:07.320]  going and Steve Quayles talked an awful lot about all kinds of foreign troops
[1:19:07.320 --> 1:19:12.160]  that are ready to just come marching across so well that's not just Steve
[1:19:12.160 --> 1:19:15.960]  saying that I mean that's in major Canadian papers that u.s. troops are
[1:19:15.960 --> 1:19:19.640]  going to be used in a year ago in Canada just like the u.s. did the same thing a
[1:19:19.640 --> 1:19:23.080]  year ago they announced all troops are going to start patrolling all the major
[1:19:23.080 --> 1:19:27.840]  cities and bar districts and helping with domestic disturbances and men and
[1:19:27.840 --> 1:19:32.200]  women fighting with each other and all troops are just here and remember Glenn
[1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:38.680]  Eagles during the g7 g8 meeting back in 2005 the government clearly staged that
[1:19:38.680 --> 1:19:44.280]  attack to coincide with that yes I think I think Canada is a prime target for
[1:19:44.280 --> 1:19:50.440]  chicanery skull duggery and other forms of sneakiness by the establishment
[1:19:50.440 --> 1:19:53.560]  because they're losing a lot of credibility right now and they want to
[1:19:53.560 --> 1:19:57.360]  play the war card the terror card they let the dude on international stage like

[1:24:48.120 --> 1:24:52.520]  the air jason hey thank you alex thanks for having me on
[1:24:52.520 --> 1:24:57.760]  um... just wanted to you know i think the tea party movement is uh... being
[1:24:57.760 --> 1:25:03.960]  hijacked so blatantly obviously by you know fox news i just i mean it's just
[1:25:03.960 --> 1:25:08.360]  so obvious so i i can't see how anybody wouldn't see it but i did want to tell
[1:25:08.360 --> 1:25:14.360]  you just two quick stories on my wife was at the pool the other day and she's
[1:25:14.360 --> 1:25:18.080]  uh... talking to a woman we live in north carolina when it's been one of the coldest
[1:25:18.080 --> 1:25:20.160]  winters we've had here in
[1:25:20.160 --> 1:25:23.800]  in a long time and a woman was complaining about it
[1:25:23.800 --> 1:25:27.240]  in the locker room in my wife's just kind of jokingly said well that's global
[1:25:27.240 --> 1:25:28.800]  warming for you and
[1:25:28.800 --> 1:25:29.920]  uh...
[1:25:29.920 --> 1:25:31.400]  kind of got almost
[1:25:31.400 --> 1:25:34.440]  kind of borderline psychotic honor and just started
[1:25:34.440 --> 1:25:36.960]  just basically kind of screaming at her that
[1:25:36.960 --> 1:25:41.040]  yes that is global warming you know that's why it's getting colder well
[1:25:41.040 --> 1:25:44.960]  well the san francisco mayor came out admitted that a san francisco company
[1:25:44.960 --> 1:25:46.920]  produced the outing
[1:25:46.920 --> 1:25:51.040]  green police ads which shows them swarming swat teaming arresting people
[1:25:51.040 --> 1:25:55.160]  for taking hot baths arresting people for the wrong light bulbs for batteries
[1:25:55.160 --> 1:25:58.120]  uh... cops getting in trouble for styrofoam cups
[1:25:58.120 --> 1:26:01.920]  and they're on a power trip this is kind of the racial consciousness of control
[1:26:01.920 --> 1:26:02.880]  freaks
[1:26:02.880 --> 1:26:06.280]  uh... and and that they're all on incredible power trip
[1:26:06.280 --> 1:26:10.400]  of parasite behavior and they know this is their time to run everything
[1:26:10.400 --> 1:26:13.880]  and so these ads are like a battle cry for them to take over and
[1:26:13.880 --> 1:26:16.360]  there's links on the outing website
[1:26:16.360 --> 1:26:20.440]  that link to actual government regulatory agencies where they brag and say
[1:26:20.440 --> 1:26:24.240]  we are actually arresting people for all this stuff this is real
[1:26:24.240 --> 1:26:26.920]  so this is a sigh of their launching
[1:26:26.920 --> 1:26:30.640]  yeah alex is very disturbing yet i'm surprised how many people i found that
[1:26:30.640 --> 1:26:32.400]  found that had to be humorous
[1:26:32.400 --> 1:26:34.840]  i mean i i had nothing but
[1:26:34.840 --> 1:26:38.440]  you know disdain and just you know it did the dad disturbed me that they were
[1:26:38.440 --> 1:26:41.960]  there's gotta be twenty twenty or more of the actual ads they only get worse and
[1:26:41.960 --> 1:26:42.560]  worse
[1:26:42.560 --> 1:26:45.180]  you go to the outing youtube site and watch them
[1:26:45.180 --> 1:26:48.620]  and they say the green police hit the streets
[1:26:48.620 --> 1:26:52.320]  february seventh and they're on the mall over the country i mean it is everything
[1:26:52.320 --> 1:26:56.040]  you see in those ads checkpoints everything is what they're really
[1:26:56.040 --> 1:26:58.000]  already setting up
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:01.480]  that's like predictive programming like you always saying but my wife is a
[1:27:01.480 --> 1:27:05.000]  little uh... she was disturbed by this woman she was actually a little afraid
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:07.920]  of her i mean she the woman just kind of became unhinged but
[1:27:07.920 --> 1:27:10.920]  i'll tell you another story turn that all uh... i'll let you know i just had
[1:27:10.920 --> 1:27:13.720]  this let me just add this who do you think is going to be doing your home
[1:27:13.720 --> 1:27:14.600]  inspections

[1:27:18.240 --> 1:27:21.080]  control freaks these are dangerous scum

[1:27:25.160 --> 1:27:26.760]  out and slice your tires

[1:27:29.240 --> 1:27:32.880]  yet yes sir and then this last one i mean it is it does relate to gun control
[1:27:32.880 --> 1:27:33.600]  but
[1:27:33.600 --> 1:27:37.600]  by a friend my brother was back in montana and he has a friend that went over
[1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:39.880]  to uh... fight in iraq
[1:27:39.880 --> 1:27:43.040]  and when he came back he tried to buy a hunting rifle
[1:27:43.040 --> 1:27:45.480]  um... this was about three months ago
[1:27:45.480 --> 1:27:48.140]  and my brother said to me well you know my
[1:27:48.140 --> 1:27:51.660]  he couldn't buy the hunting rifle and he's like do you know why
[1:27:51.660 --> 1:27:54.280]  and i said yeah i do know why because he's a veteran
[1:27:54.280 --> 1:27:57.840]  and he's like oh yeah you're right how did you know that i said well
[1:27:57.840 --> 1:28:01.120]  you know he doesn't listen to you and i say well i i knew this a long time ago
[1:28:01.120 --> 1:28:05.720]  that they that they got no judge no jury your uh... millions of americans on
[1:28:05.720 --> 1:28:07.120]  the list and them
[1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:08.440]  clinton tried this
[1:28:08.440 --> 1:28:13.080]  in his last year in office in two thousand he gave the names of eighty seven
[1:28:13.080 --> 1:28:17.080]  with no no no conviction no nothing that could known guns and now
[1:28:17.080 --> 1:28:21.920]  most people i talk to the revets suddenly can't buy firearms
[1:28:21.920 --> 1:28:25.720]  they have his brother going by the rifle for him which they call a strong
[1:28:25.720 --> 1:28:28.720]  purchase and there's a felony and they want to put him in prison for it
[1:28:28.720 --> 1:28:32.040]  well they don't haven't done that i don't know i mean again this is
[1:28:32.040 --> 1:28:35.800]  not don't tell you don't watch out they will they will come after him it
[1:28:35.800 --> 1:28:37.960]  if he tells anybody that
[1:28:37.960 --> 1:28:42.760]  user he's not allowed as a veteran with no criminal record to own a gun he has
[1:28:42.760 --> 1:28:46.520]  served the new world order they're afraid of him he's the number one enemy in
[1:28:46.520 --> 1:28:49.200]  their secret documents
[1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:53.120]  amen thank you for having me on but but but let me just ask you this uh...
[1:28:53.120 --> 1:28:55.680]  jason did it wake him up now that
[1:28:55.680 --> 1:28:58.840]  that that that that he's a disarmed slave
[1:28:58.840 --> 1:29:01.400]  well it it certainly woke my brother up
[1:29:01.400 --> 1:29:05.400]  somewhat you know what i mean uh... and especially the fact that he knew
[1:29:05.400 --> 1:29:09.000]  that he the fact that i knew why he was not able to purchase
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:12.080]  you know the hunting rifle what do they have

[1:29:21.040 --> 1:29:24.280]  you know roughly seven thousand people where he's got to go through the
[1:29:24.280 --> 1:29:25.600]  procedures
[1:29:25.600 --> 1:29:29.200]  to block that and there are procedures
[1:29:29.200 --> 1:29:32.440]  there look they're setting the precedent that they just ban you being able to own
[1:29:32.440 --> 1:29:34.680]  a gun when they feel like it god bless you jason
[1:29:34.680 --> 1:29:38.320]  but of course the nr and others will stand up for veterans

[1:29:41.160 --> 1:29:42.160]  because
[1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:46.720]  i'd i'd uh... what he's talking about has been confirmed over and over again

[1:33:07.800 --> 1:33:11.240]  alone on a hill
[1:33:11.240 --> 1:33:18.240]  the man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
[1:33:18.240 --> 1:33:21.240]  nobody wants to know him
[1:33:21.240 --> 1:33:25.240]  they can see that he's just a fool
[1:33:25.240 --> 1:33:28.240]  and he never gives an answer
[1:33:28.240 --> 1:33:31.240]  but the fool on the hill
[1:33:31.240 --> 1:33:35.240]  sees the sun going down
[1:33:35.240 --> 1:33:37.240]  welcome ladies and gentlemen
[1:33:37.240 --> 1:33:43.240]  the next two and a half hours of this four hour radio broadcast or being simulcast not just on the radio
[1:33:43.240 --> 1:33:50.240]  but live in living color at prison planet dot tv if you want to watch the television side of the live radio show with the
[1:33:50.240 --> 1:33:58.240]  document cams the video clips everything we do go to prison planet dot tv
[1:33:58.240 --> 1:34:04.240]  i'm going to get into the fact that the tea party movement is being taken over by the republican party tea party nation
[1:34:04.240 --> 1:34:11.240]  and that ron paul really founded what is the modern tea party movement and now even mainstream media is pointing that out
[1:34:11.240 --> 1:34:21.240]  first i want to go to a clip to show you the true proto tea party or that that came before the birth of the tea party
[1:34:21.240 --> 1:34:28.240]  the patriot movement in the nineteen nineties and a video clip from nineteen ninety seven of myself and others in austin
[1:34:28.240 --> 1:34:33.240]  cutting up a united nations flag as they had a burn ban at the capital that day
[1:34:33.240 --> 1:34:37.240]  every year on for the july from ninety six up until about two thousand we had time
[1:34:37.240 --> 1:34:41.240]  we go down and burn you in flags uh... at the state capital
[1:34:41.240 --> 1:34:47.240]  and the media did stuff like showing film footage of someone burning an american flag and then would cut to me
[1:34:47.240 --> 1:34:50.240]  and then i'd get hate calls that i was burning american flags
[1:34:50.240 --> 1:34:56.240]  that's the type of media spin and deception that's destroying the mainstream media and why they've lost almost all credibility
[1:34:56.240 --> 1:34:59.240]  it's like local loss of news saying mercury's good for your children
[1:34:59.240 --> 1:35:03.240]  but i wanted to let you know something about the free iphone app
[1:35:03.240 --> 1:35:07.240]  we launched a free iphone app that has a little news feed on it
[1:35:07.240 --> 1:35:12.240]  that can be an alarm clock that is a link to the live and archive streams
[1:35:12.240 --> 1:35:17.240]  we're building a separate page it links to that has all the mp3's and podcast
[1:35:17.240 --> 1:35:25.240]  i want to tell you about our new free iphone app and a huge development that took place to show you how popular this radio show is
[1:35:25.240 --> 1:35:33.240]  why the government cast sunstein at the white house the regulations are the u n microsoft's chief technology officer
[1:35:33.240 --> 1:35:38.240]  and others are calling to censor the web to make you have a net id to get online
[1:35:38.240 --> 1:35:44.240]  cast sunstein says ban criticism of the government ban saying that man may global warming isn't real
[1:35:44.240 --> 1:35:50.240]  ban conspiracy theories that means questioning anything they say if you say obama's health care plan is socialist
[1:35:50.240 --> 1:35:57.240]  racist you're a conspiracy theorist tony blair on fox news said if you believe that they lied about wmds
[1:35:57.240 --> 1:36:01.240]  it's a conspiracy theory if you say the sun comes up it's a conspiracy theory

[1:39:24.240 --> 1:39:27.240]  now i want to go back to 1997
[1:39:27.240 --> 1:39:33.240]  where mike hanson jeff davis and myself and a couple hundred people the camera shots are us on the stage if you look it's
[1:39:33.240 --> 1:39:38.240]  couple hundred people out there in the crowd would go down to the capital every year and point out that
[1:39:38.240 --> 1:39:46.240]  poor that you lied about drinking beer and getting drunk and get a dwi it's about knowing what the bill of rights the constitution is
[1:39:46.240 --> 1:39:55.240]  and how foreign governments have taken over our sovereignty so here i am 13 years ago and this is clips from that day live
[1:39:55.240 --> 1:40:04.240]  being played on local access tv with rusty fields and others here it is movement here in austin you get a show like his on nightly
[1:40:04.240 --> 1:40:11.240]  on on a mainstream station such as kjfk
[1:40:11.240 --> 1:40:17.240]  after this song we're going to shred this human flag since there's a burn man
[1:40:17.240 --> 1:40:22.240]  we'll get a little bit of desiccrate flag
[1:40:22.240 --> 1:40:28.240]  that's an accursed symbol
[1:40:28.240 --> 1:40:35.240]  we need somebody to come hold this flag while we shred it
[1:40:35.240 --> 1:40:39.240]  hold it
[1:40:39.240 --> 1:40:44.240]  we say to tyranny in the united nations
[1:40:44.240 --> 1:40:51.240]  to the new world order get the idea of losing our sovereignty we don't like this flag and we're sick and tired of it
[1:40:51.240 --> 1:40:55.240]  we stand for this country and we will defend it
[1:40:55.240 --> 1:41:03.240]  the united nations is a tyrannical authoritarian propaganda arm and military arm of international control
[1:41:03.240 --> 1:41:09.240]  and do it we refuse to submit that's all that's going to be left to you and they keep pushing their lives
[1:41:09.240 --> 1:41:16.240]  the loss of u.s. sovereignty has gone too far
[1:41:16.240 --> 1:41:22.240]  we'll fix to get another one
[1:41:22.240 --> 1:41:29.240]  where's jeff davison
[1:41:29.240 --> 1:41:32.240]  yes of the new world order
[1:41:32.240 --> 1:41:36.240]  right there baby yes yes
[1:41:36.240 --> 1:41:42.240]  tyranny is going down baby we know what the u.n. stands for we're not going to stand for global tyranny
[1:41:42.240 --> 1:41:54.240]  yes
[1:41:54.240 --> 1:41:57.240]  what a pleasure to burn that accursed symbol
[1:41:57.240 --> 1:42:00.240]  what an absolute pleasure to rip that rag
[1:42:00.240 --> 1:42:03.240]  that filthy rag that united nations
[1:42:03.240 --> 1:42:09.240]  the supreme court can rule whatever they want but i rule the supreme court rusty rules the supreme court
[1:42:09.240 --> 1:42:14.240]  we don't like this flag
[1:42:14.240 --> 1:42:19.240]  local television host alex jones and nearly three dozen others protested in front of the state capital today
[1:42:19.240 --> 1:42:23.240]  they object to what they believe is a loss of america's sovereignty to the united nations
[1:42:23.240 --> 1:42:30.240]  the group's members say the fourth is a perfect time to tell the public about a growing threat of a new world order
[1:42:30.240 --> 1:42:36.240]  many gather downtown to protest what they call a lie of current freedom in america
[1:42:36.240 --> 1:42:41.240]  that was led by international shortwave radio host jeff davis
[1:42:41.240 --> 1:42:44.240]  the protest was held on the capital grounds
[1:42:44.240 --> 1:42:50.240]  the group say independence day is the perfect time to bring their message to americans
[1:42:50.240 --> 1:42:54.240]  we're not going to perpetrate the lie that we're afraid of independence
[1:42:54.240 --> 1:42:59.240]  we're countering the fact that thousands of people are going to be down here at town late
[1:42:59.240 --> 1:43:04.240]  drinking their beer and watching the fireworks
[1:43:04.240 --> 1:43:07.240]  our bill of rights essentially has been flushed down the toilet
[1:43:07.240 --> 1:43:09.240]  alex
[1:43:09.240 --> 1:43:11.240]  what's going on guys
[1:43:11.240 --> 1:43:14.240]  we wanted to do it on the air but unfortunately we couldn't do it
[1:43:14.240 --> 1:43:17.240]  first of all i want to congratulate you i think it's excellent
[1:43:17.240 --> 1:43:20.240]  that you're going to be on kjfk every night now so congratulations
[1:43:20.240 --> 1:43:22.240]  yeah six days a week man
[1:43:22.240 --> 1:43:24.240]  let freedom ring
[1:43:24.240 --> 1:43:26.240]  it's lost and ready
[1:43:26.240 --> 1:43:29.240]  you bet mike has been busting his butt
[1:43:29.240 --> 1:43:35.240]  put some stories together that mike got put them together with tags and voiceovers and things
[1:43:35.240 --> 1:43:37.240]  mike has been busting his ass
[1:43:37.240 --> 1:43:41.240]  that's enough of this video i haven't even watched the whole thing
[1:43:41.240 --> 1:43:45.240]  you can watch it it's up at info wars dot com and prism planet dot com
[1:43:45.240 --> 1:43:48.240]  mike has hundreds of our old tv shows
[1:43:48.240 --> 1:43:52.240]  hundreds of them we ought to put them all on youtube because they're evergreen
[1:43:52.240 --> 1:43:56.240]  you see what i was doing fifteen fourteen thirteen twelve years ago
[1:43:56.240 --> 1:44:00.240]  eleven years ago ten years ago it all came true
[1:44:00.240 --> 1:44:04.240]  you can take what we're talking about there and play it today and it's exactly what's ongoing
[1:44:04.240 --> 1:44:07.240]  with this incremental tearing now
[1:44:07.240 --> 1:44:10.240]  that's the real foundation of the tea party
[1:44:10.240 --> 1:44:12.240]  that's where it really started
[1:44:12.240 --> 1:44:16.240]  all over the country from michigan to california to new york to texas
[1:44:16.240 --> 1:44:19.240]  similar people outstanding up
[1:44:19.240 --> 1:44:22.240]  okay ragtag bands
[1:44:22.240 --> 1:44:25.240]  that's what happened in the fifteen years
[1:44:25.240 --> 1:44:29.240]  plus leading up to seventeen seventy five seventeen seventy six
[1:44:29.240 --> 1:44:32.240]  with the committees of correspondence out educating people
[1:44:32.240 --> 1:44:35.240]  small minority of people that had the truth
[1:44:35.240 --> 1:44:36.240]  now
[1:44:36.240 --> 1:44:40.240]  nine eleven truth about six years ago started having tea parties
[1:44:40.240 --> 1:44:42.240]  to protest the fraud of nine eleven
[1:44:42.240 --> 1:44:45.240]  and then those grow into protesting the federal reserve
[1:44:45.240 --> 1:44:47.240]  and the new world order
[1:44:47.240 --> 1:44:49.240]  and then three years ago
[1:44:49.240 --> 1:44:54.240]  the first tea party for ron paul was the idea of local austin activist
[1:44:54.240 --> 1:44:56.240]  not even mine
[1:44:56.240 --> 1:44:58.240]  but we supported and promoted it
[1:44:58.240 --> 1:45:02.240]  and they had the news reported close to a thousand people at one five hundred at another
[1:45:02.240 --> 1:45:06.240]  they went on the congress street bridge it was all over the news
[1:45:06.240 --> 1:45:07.240]  and then
[1:45:07.240 --> 1:45:10.240]  all over the campuses they were called tea parties for ron paul
[1:45:10.240 --> 1:45:11.240]  but really
[1:45:11.240 --> 1:45:14.240]  if you can say one place it was all born
[1:45:14.240 --> 1:45:18.240]  austin texas is the first tea parties for ron paul
[1:45:18.240 --> 1:45:22.240]  the first real tea party for nine eleven six years ago in boston
[1:45:22.240 --> 1:45:25.240]  nine eleven truth and others in boston
[1:45:25.240 --> 1:45:30.240]  where they would throw copies of the nine eleven commission report into the water
[1:45:30.240 --> 1:45:31.240]  so
[1:45:31.240 --> 1:45:34.240]  that's what's really been going on and happening
[1:45:34.240 --> 1:45:36.240]  now fast forward to ron paul
[1:45:36.240 --> 1:45:41.240]  and the neocons have taken over the main tea party they call it tea party nation a corporation
[1:45:41.240 --> 1:45:45.240]  and they're running people against ron paul in texas
[1:45:45.240 --> 1:45:48.240]  the republican party the democrats don't even opposing
[1:45:48.240 --> 1:45:51.240]  the republicans don't want a real constitutionalist
[1:45:51.240 --> 1:45:55.240]  here's rachel madow talking about it and we'll play a clip of ron paul
[1:45:55.240 --> 1:45:56.240]  here it is
[1:46:11.240 --> 1:46:13.240]  supporters of congressman ron paul
[1:46:13.240 --> 1:46:16.240]  back in december two thousand seven
[1:46:16.240 --> 1:46:21.240]  celebrating the two hundred and thirty fourth anniversary of the boston tea party with rallies across the nation
[1:46:21.240 --> 1:46:28.240]  and an online money bomb that raised millions of dollars for ron paul's presidential bid in two thousand eight
[1:46:28.240 --> 1:46:35.240]  congressman ron paul's candidacy was arguably the spiritual godfather of what's now become the tea party movement
[1:46:35.240 --> 1:46:38.240]  the current figurehead of the movement arguably is sarah palin
[1:46:38.240 --> 1:46:41.240]  she's endorsed ron paul's son rand
[1:46:41.240 --> 1:46:46.240]  ron paul was open minded enough to make his senate campaign announcement several months ago on this very show
[1:46:46.240 --> 1:46:53.240]  rand paul like his dad is philosophically a libertarian but he's running for office as a republican
[1:46:53.240 --> 1:47:00.240]  weirdly congressman ron paul himself is now under attack from the very movement that he's seemingly inspired
[1:47:00.240 --> 1:47:06.240]  he's getting primaried in his district in texas by not one not two but three republican challengers
[1:47:06.240 --> 1:47:11.240]  whom have associated themselves with the tea party movement by attending or organizing tea party rallies
[1:47:11.240 --> 1:47:18.240]  they're each apparently hoping that the anti-incumbent fervor of the tea party movement will sweep ron paul out of office
[1:47:18.240 --> 1:47:25.240]  yes ron paul the conservative candidate who in two thousand eight was able to draw more than ten thousand supporters
[1:47:25.240 --> 1:47:33.240]  away from the republican national convention with his libertarian message to attend his own shadow convention in minneapolis
[1:47:33.240 --> 1:47:40.240]  he's now getting challenged by the supposedly libertarian leaning conservatives that his presidential candidacy inspired
[1:47:40.240 --> 1:47:47.240]  if they're not cool with ron paul who are they cool with joining us now is dave weigel the senior report
[1:47:47.240 --> 1:47:55.240]  okay now let's go to that was two nights ago this is last night with rachel madow at the intro of the piece
[1:47:55.240 --> 1:48:02.240]  with sarah palin saying the republicans have got to take over the tea party the same republicans that triple the size of government
[1:48:02.240 --> 1:48:09.240]  expanded nafta and gat the north american union spp the same ones that lied about wmds the same ones that
[1:48:09.240 --> 1:48:16.240]  are in many cases going after our second amendment the same people run by wall street just like barack obama
[1:48:16.240 --> 1:48:21.240]  let's go ahead and go to this clip here it is
[1:48:21.240 --> 1:48:27.240]  the republican party would be really smart to start trying to absorb as much of the tea party movement as possible
[1:48:27.240 --> 1:48:32.240]  because this is the future of our country the tea party movement is the future of politics
[1:48:32.240 --> 1:48:40.240]  the tea party movement is a revelatory moment for us it really puts in stark relief where the american people are
[1:48:40.240 --> 1:48:45.240]  how they feel and what they feel and i think it's important for our party to appreciate and understand this
[1:48:45.240 --> 1:48:49.240]  so that we can move towards it embrace it and then move into the future
[1:48:49.240 --> 1:48:54.240]  that's the chairman of the republican national committee and before him the fox news commentator
[1:48:54.240 --> 1:49:00.240]  they now say is the de facto leader of the tea party movement arguing that the republican party's path back to power
[1:49:00.240 --> 1:49:07.240]  is that movement that's the rhetoric today rhetoric became reality in the state of south carolina where the state republican party
[1:49:07.240 --> 1:49:14.240]  and a coalition of state tea party groups agreed to work together moving forward the merging has started
[1:49:14.240 --> 1:49:19.240]  and the effort by the republican party to adopt and absorb what sells itself as a grassroots
[1:49:19.240 --> 1:49:27.240]  three weeks ago i had msnbc here in my office with chris mathews they understood none of this i explained it all to him
[1:49:27.240 --> 1:49:35.240]  and i said the republican path to power is through the tea parties they are word for word copying everything i said to him
[1:49:35.240 --> 1:49:41.240]  and they claim in april they're gonna air this hour long documentary they plan to air they said at least 15 times
[1:49:41.240 --> 1:49:47.240]  chris mathews makes these three times a year this last one was about kennedy dying
[1:49:47.240 --> 1:49:55.240]  and so we'll see if they butcher what i had to say but they couldn't even figure this out now i think they had it figured out
[1:49:55.240 --> 1:50:03.240]  because i told the media back in january of last year 13 months ago that there was no doubt about it
[1:50:03.240 --> 1:50:15.240]  absolutely no doubt in the universe that the republicans were going to take over the tea party were the first to call it
[1:50:15.240 --> 1:50:21.240]  and the control corporate fake liberal media came in and said this is a republican party run when it wasn't
[1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:28.240]  and loy dog it wasn't being booed it was all staged and i explained and played clips of perry and cornyn in texas and other republicans
[1:50:28.240 --> 1:50:34.240]  being booed everywhere they went when they were trying to take over the tea party right at the beginning
[1:50:34.240 --> 1:50:41.240]  but the media never told anybody that because they wanted to make it a partisan issue phrase it and frame it as that
[1:50:41.240 --> 1:50:49.240]  and the republicans would all run into it thinking it was the thing to do to get the democrats mad that's how they control opposition
[1:50:49.240 --> 1:50:55.240]  it's just like bush being against global warming taxes made all the europeans get behind it thinking well it must be real
[1:50:55.240 --> 1:51:01.240]  and then he baited and switched and came out for it they manipulate you across party lines
[1:51:01.240 --> 1:51:11.240]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know that in a real meltdown

[1:54:14.240 --> 1:54:24.240]  okay let's go to this next clip from Rachel Maddow with Ron Paul last night where they further discussed the fact that neocons
[1:54:24.240 --> 1:54:32.240]  are hijacking the Tea Party movement the totally discredited hated lowest approval rating for Congress ever of 11%
[1:54:32.240 --> 1:54:39.240]  Cheney with a 9% and they've now attached themselves as revolutionaries is outside the box
[1:54:39.240 --> 1:54:45.240]  and you see the Republican Party Chairman Steele saying we must go to them we must embrace them we must do what they say
[1:54:45.240 --> 1:54:53.240]  but that's not what's happening at the Tea Party we must attack Iran we must keep the Patriot Act we must keep the torture
[1:54:53.240 --> 1:55:04.240]  we must continue Obama needs to play the war card yeah oh yeah something dying empire more of that here's Ron Paul
[1:55:04.240 --> 1:55:14.240]  you are being challenged in your reelection primary by several Tea Partyers what what is your relationship with the Tea Party movement now
[1:55:14.240 --> 1:55:25.240]  well it's about the same you know sometimes the Tea Party represents those views that I expressed during the campaign the Tea Party type movement
[1:55:25.240 --> 1:55:31.240]  the people who are unhappy with the government where I go generally are on the campuses and we still get large crowds out
[1:55:31.240 --> 1:55:38.240]  but my message is somewhat different I think the message gets a little bit diluted when a lot of people come in and the Republican Party
[1:55:38.240 --> 1:55:47.240]  wants to make sure that maybe there's a neocon type of influence but but no what we're doing with the campaign for liberty is alive and well
[1:55:47.240 --> 1:55:55.240]  and the young people are responding but I talk a lot about a different foreign policy I talk about civil liberties and I talk about where we ought to cut the budget
[1:55:55.240 --> 1:56:03.240]  and and this is what they want to hear I talk about the war on drugs this is not what is generally heard from the Republican Party
[1:56:03.240 --> 1:56:13.240]  and sometimes the Tea Party accepts these ideas and sometimes they don't but I think I think if the one thing that brings people together is
[1:56:13.240 --> 1:56:21.240]  they know there's something wrong in Washington but you have progressive Democrats that know there's something wrong in Washington they'd like a better foreign policy too
[1:56:21.240 --> 1:56:28.240]  and they're they're not exactly totally satisfied so but the people are coming together because they're unhappy they know that
[1:56:28.240 --> 1:56:40.240]  absolutely and so the Republicans who are just as bad just as much control by offshore banks in some cases even worse they are now claiming they are us
[1:56:40.240 --> 1:56:49.240]  that's what Glenn Beck Sarah Palin all of them Glenn Beck two days after I cover something word for word he covers it but twist it
[1:56:49.240 --> 1:56:58.240]  they're programming their shows off of this radio broadcast to fool you and that's why they're so dangerous now

[2:00:58.240 --> 2:01:09.240]  saying they're God going crazy hitting on women groping people this is par for the course and they've been caught lying saying they can't print or save images that we know is a lie
[2:01:09.240 --> 2:01:19.240]  that's a key story everybody needs to get out to everybody and needs to go viral right now right now let's go back to the calls who is up next year John
[2:01:19.240 --> 2:01:35.240]  all right step in Texas you're on the air go ahead hey Mr. Jones I called you guys today I wanted to thank you for putting up this story about the national emergency I will admit that's probably the best overall story about it
[2:01:35.240 --> 2:01:49.240]  I've seen it anywhere I like to congratulate I like to congratulate you on that I also want to get to the end of the second part of what I was saying the other day this is the foundation of the entire N.W.O.
[2:01:49.240 --> 2:02:05.240]  the UN the IMF the World Bank the BIC the whole deal the whole deal that's how they operate outside of the Bill of Rights and Constitution is they declare emergencies inside governments they control and that's how the shadow government is in control
[2:02:05.240 --> 2:02:27.240]  yes sir but we have the same thing going on worldwide and let me explain to you if you look at the UN Charter at article 53 in 107 it describes there the sole reason the only reason for the UN's existence is to wage war on what they define as the axis
[2:02:27.240 --> 2:02:43.240]  this is why George Bush is running around saying you know the evil axis countries the axis of this he was using that to empower him through the UN Charter so once the war first the axis is over the UN must disband
[2:02:43.240 --> 2:02:50.240]  yes it's a war powers act it's a war powers act step I appreciate your call Ted in Texas you're on the air go ahead
[2:02:50.240 --> 2:03:06.240]  hey Alex I have a question and I have a comment okay go ahead okay the question is I'd like to know what you think about Sarah Palin throwing his support behind Rand Paul and then I'd like to know what your interpretation of him accepting her endorsement is
[2:03:06.240 --> 2:03:22.240]  that's my question and then I have a comment later well she has endorsed hundreds of candidates in the neocons jumped on her last week and put me in articles concerning it where Rand Paul said I'm widening my base widening what I have to say
[2:03:22.240 --> 2:03:37.240]  you know to be more palatable the general Republican Party to basically win and he has said that if we're attacked and we have a specific enemy that you know we should have gone after Saudi Arabia they supposedly did 911 instead of Iraq
[2:03:37.240 --> 2:03:52.240]  and so they they spun that to say he's being deceptive being a little bit more mainline Republican to get elected and I said well you know do you agree with your father basically 100% he said yes and so the neocons are going after him and they're mad that Palin endorsed him
[2:03:52.240 --> 2:04:08.240]  and they're trying to get that endorsement removed but you see her true colors going after Medina trying to prop up as she surges and is about to eclipse him she's got a good chance of winning now and so I mean I think Rand Paul's great
[2:04:08.240 --> 2:04:17.240]  now if he gets in and go sideways on us or something I'll have to come out against him but I don't think that's going to happen we should support Rand Rand Paul for the U.S. Senate
[2:04:17.240 --> 2:04:28.240]  this was a little confused by the you know non support for Medina and then the support for Rand so I guess we'll just have to watch that and then my comment is is I called back a while ago I really

[2:08:59.240 --> 2:09:12.240]  so you can listen on any cell phone with that system but this is easy just get the app you've got it we're adding a news feature to it news tickers it's got an alarm clock a bunch of other features it's got a big back end we can add things to it's already got a bunch of features
[2:09:12.240 --> 2:09:32.240]  and that's free about five weeks ago or so we had Max Kaiser on the show and he was talking about learned helplessness and he was reading from an article our Americans are broken people why we've stopped fighting back against the forces of oppression
[2:09:32.240 --> 2:09:53.240]  and then I had a chance to see Dr. Bruce E. Levine on Max's TV show so we got him on the broadcast today because I've read so many corporate documents one of the best examples was in 2001 they had a RFID summit in Chicago with Gillette the Pentagon
[2:09:53.240 --> 2:10:06.240]  and others saying how do we force everybody to accept RFID and every can of beans every razor all your tires tracking everywhere you go will make the real world like a Google searchable system where everything's tracked
[2:10:06.240 --> 2:10:26.240]  and they said our internal studies show 87% don't want this but it also shows we can create a sense of brokenness or desperation where they just submit once we break through these barriers so they know what they're doing and the naked body scanners recording you and your children's genitals lying about it saying they don't record it
[2:10:26.240 --> 2:10:37.240]  now it's admitted they do record it in the TSA zone documents it's all about a journey into total enslavement now the chief of police in Austin takes blood without warrants they do it all over the state of Texas
[2:10:37.240 --> 2:10:57.240]  I mean under a federal grant in England they come up and do random checkpoints and ask you if you're a terrorist we're being bathed in tyranny Bruce E. Levine PhD is a clinical psychologist and author of is surviving American depression epidemic how to find moral energy
[2:10:57.240 --> 2:11:12.240]  and community in a world gone crazy Dr. Levine has been a private practice since 85 and is presented talks and workshops to diverse organizations around North America he's also the author of common sense rebellion taking back your life from drugs
[2:11:12.240 --> 2:11:28.240]  that's that's a good psychologist shrinks corporations in the world gone crazy and 2003 and he was recently authored the chapter trouble children and teens common sense solutions without psychiatric drugs and manipulations for alternative beyond psychiatry Peter
[2:11:28.240 --> 2:11:43.240]  Lehmann publishing 2007 Dr. Levine has been a regular contributor to Z Magazine alternate in his articles interviews have been published in numerous other magazines he is an editorial advisor for the Icarus Project Freedom Center harm reduction guide to coming off psychiatric drugs
[2:11:43.240 --> 2:11:59.240]  on the editorial advisory board of the journal for ethical human psychological and psychiatry Bruce Levine is his website spelled Bruce L. E. V. I. N. E. dot net and we again appreciate him joining us maybe I should keep the whole hour if he's got time it
[2:11:59.240 --> 2:12:14.240]  just happened to 40 after because I want to talk some about the mass drugging of the population and then how these synthetic drugs and many studies are more dangerous than heroin and cocaine and now they're saying pregnant women are all mentally ill and you have a car wreck or mentally
[2:12:14.240 --> 2:12:29.240]  everybody's got to be drug but that's a separate issue from this type of broken population who've capitulated I kind of took issue with Max Kaiser on the TV show and he said you know Alex Jones tells you all these problems where the solutions all we talk about taking our states back
[2:12:29.240 --> 2:12:45.240]  during the left-right paradigm is empowering people how you can stand up all we are solutions but I also believe the biggest solution is really discrediting the system and really bringing people to grips with just how ruthless and sociopathic and in some cases
[2:12:45.240 --> 2:13:01.240]  statistically psychopathic elites that have been competing with each other in a kind of survival of the fittest race towards the most corrupt manipulative and silver-tongued getting into control and we see that throughout human civilization last 10,000 years but doctor thanks for coming on with us
[2:13:01.240 --> 2:13:03.240]  good to be on your show else
[2:13:03.240 --> 2:13:11.240]  okay you got the floor break down this article are we a broken people and then how this has happened and how we empower ourselves
[2:13:11.240 --> 2:13:22.240]  okay well a lot of things that I think a lot of folks that probably have a reflex a healthy reflex that anything a psychologist has to say is like well this is just going to be some elitist psychopath
[2:13:22.240 --> 2:13:36.240]  I think that's a healthy reflex so let me just preface what I'm saying is that there are some a lot of the kind of elitism in this my whole profession has to do some of its outright lies but a lot of it has to do with trying to make stuff that's just basic common sense
[2:13:36.240 --> 2:13:50.240]  into using professional jargon to make it sound like it's some kind of special inside information so let me just talk about a few things that are important when you're trying to understand how you break a population that are just basic common sense
[2:13:50.240 --> 2:14:10.240]  one is this whole idea of learned helplessness which I guess a bunch of my colleagues had to go through a whole bunch of studies shocking dogs discover that if you put a dog in a situation where they've got no control over their shocks you know they're going to get into a depressed helpful state versus a dog who gets to have some control over their shocks and they're going to not be so depressed
[2:14:10.240 --> 2:14:28.240]  this is basic common sense stuff if you've got no control over your situation if all you get to do every year for example specifically is to choose between a democrat who pushes corporate control and senseless wars a republican who pushes corporate control and senseless wars
[2:14:28.240 --> 2:14:43.240]  or you get to vote maybe for a third party and then the democrat and republican wins or you don't vote and in any case you always get corporate control and senseless wars you move into a kind of state of learned helplessness okay that's all that really means
[2:14:43.240 --> 2:15:00.240]  another I think important concept again common sense stuff for any of you out there who have ever been in an abuse syndrome or know anybody in it is you realize that you get to a certain point where you've been kind of beat up and allowed yourself to stay in a relationship too long
[2:15:00.240 --> 2:15:19.240]  whether this is with another human being or with an institution or with a government that you go too far and you get broken so in other words you get to a situation where you know the truth okay you know the truth that for example the guy or the woman that you're with is physically emotionally sexually abusive
[2:15:19.240 --> 2:15:35.240]  you cannot leave you're too weak or you're in that situation in your corporation and you're busy and you know that about your boss but you've gotten yourself so weak that you cannot leave or that in fact happens I think for citizens in a society who actually more and more people don't even call them
[2:15:35.240 --> 2:15:51.240]  social citizens in the US anymore they call themselves consumers customers I mean I mean that you know and so you get to a certain point which I'm concerned of that has already happened here in the United States is that we do have a broken population and and that we get to a point where
[2:15:51.240 --> 2:16:07.240]  the truth is inspirational for some people it is energizing for some people it is helps them you know but not for everybody this is not Thomas Paine colonial America where where you had a guy like Thomas Paine taking the courage to write a book called
[2:16:07.240 --> 2:16:22.240]  you know a pamphlet called common sense and then you know knowing the population knew that how much guts that took because if they caught them they would hang them and you know you know half only about hundreds of thousands of people read it and it's inspired them this is not this kind of society anymore
[2:16:22.240 --> 2:16:35.240]  most of those colonials were not broken people okay and we have a society today where unfortunately you know truth does not set people up for you and that's what happens when you have an abused broken population
[2:16:35.240 --> 2:16:51.240]  well I agree with you but I read well over 100 books on the revolutionary period and the 15 years before that I think is even more important and I know it was 1% that started it 3% in the middle of the war 5% by the end
[2:16:51.240 --> 2:17:10.240]  really 80% kind of sat out and the British had about 15% supporting them and if you even look at bad revolutions like the communists or the Nazis they were only 5% at the start so you know my message is good revolutions bad revolutions against corruption or
[2:17:10.240 --> 2:17:28.240]  tyranny or fake revolutions into more tyranny it's always a minority that changes the world look at abolitionist in 1800 maybe 2% of the population 66 years later slavery is basically over but other forms of it continued so my issue is hey half the people
[2:17:28.240 --> 2:17:36.240]  here this show may get even more helpless I'm not looking for them doctor I'm looking for those that have the spirit of 1776
[2:17:36.240 --> 2:17:47.240]  well that makes sense we're not we're not in any disagreement Alex I mean that that that's that's what I totally you know if if you're not completely broken truth are going to energize you so for example you mentioned the abolitionist
[2:17:47.240 --> 2:17:59.240]  John Brown you know he his dream was he's going to go ahead and confront the U.S. government in the most direct way possible that's going to inspire a flavorful military attack young
[2:17:59.240 --> 2:18:12.240]  yeah it never happened but it did inspire a lot of other people it was highly energizing for some people who who really who were on the on the fence they are close to feeling like this was this was a great idea
[2:18:12.240 --> 2:18:25.240]  so I think that's an important thing if you're if you're going to think about this thing psychologically is that you have to kind of gauge your population and you know for example not waste time with with a completely broken population that in some ways not
[2:18:25.240 --> 2:18:36.240]  only aren't you going to energize them but if you've ever hung out with anybody who is an abuse syndrome on a personal level that not only don't you energize them by telling them that their spouse is an abusive idiot
[2:18:36.240 --> 2:18:48.240]  you know you can shame them you can make them feel put them even in more pain and you know pain for me is is the source of what people get depressed and apathetic if you get people are overwhelmed by enough pain
[2:18:48.240 --> 2:18:57.240]  they shut down they get they just drank alcohol they use you know drugs you know they get they'll get depressed and so you have to gauge your population who you're talking to
[2:18:57.240 --> 2:19:12.240]  well I agree with you and I and I I do know that the truth has a unfortunate byproduct but it's it's worse though I think for people that never even know that truth but subconsciously kind of based in this really sick dying culture
[2:19:12.240 --> 2:19:25.240]  I mean there's no doubt we're as decadent as anything the planets ever seen and I find a lot of people get depressed but then years later it's almost like a delayed time bomb I see some of the apathetic later come out of it
[2:19:25.240 --> 2:19:38.240]  right that's true that's absolutely true there are certain times and that's it's much easier to kind of gauge this on a personal level than it is when you're speaking in mass to this large audience that you and I are talking to right now but there are
[2:19:38.240 --> 2:19:52.240]  definitely some people right now out there who are just you know listening and they've never heard a psychologist for example say that most of what my profession is doing out there is to kind of either a make money off of them or be
[2:19:52.240 --> 2:20:02.240]  be kind of a police part of the interpersonal police for the established order to control them I mean I agree stay there we got a break amazing stay there doctor

[2:24:21.240 --> 2:24:36.240]  talk about a face in the crowd I mean give me a break you ever seen that movie face in the crowd Jim Kramer give me I'm gonna shut up right now short segment long segment coming up I'm gonna go ahead and keep our guests the whole hour this is just too powerful with Dr. Bruce
[2:24:36.240 --> 2:24:52.240]  D. Levine PhD is saying okay I've got a few questions and I want you to roll with what you're saying about psychiatry psychologist being this this this enforcement arm you know it it's separate from people just getting desperate and submitting to abusers and government or personal relationships
[2:24:52.240 --> 2:25:17.240]  or in work there's even more extreme things like the Stockholm syndrome obviously where people defend their oppressors they do a little crime stop or welly and trick of saying I like the abuse it's good it keeps me safe as almost like a psychological evolutionary system to make them not feel bad and to love their servitude
[2:25:17.240 --> 2:25:33.240]  sure I mean when you get when you you know you have to kind of justify why why you haven't escaped right I mean it's one of those kinds of things in life where if you haven't you know you realize at some level it's humiliating to be on it to be controlled to be enslaved to be dominated
[2:25:33.240 --> 2:25:49.240]  and so if you don't extricate yourself from that situation you have to tell yourself all kinds of things another fancy psychological term which again is common sense of something called cognitive dissonance which is just a jargon term of saying that people don't like to be in a state of tension
[2:25:49.240 --> 2:26:04.240]  and so they'll do things to escape that state of tension for some people they'll escape an abusive situation for other people they will tell themselves they're not in an abusive situation that's what a lot of the u.s. citizenry does that's what you hear from republicans democrats school teachers
[2:26:04.240 --> 2:26:20.240]  mental health professionals you hear that all the time it's their way up like justifying why they're why they're not rebelling you know even though you know I could give you example after example urges and you can too where it's just obvious that we're in some kind of a tyrannical non-democratic not even a republic a republic here
[2:26:20.240 --> 2:26:37.240]  but people just do nothing and the reason why they have to do that is they you know justify it with all kinds of stuff is all you know it may not be great here but we're still living in the greatest country in all the world and all these kinds of other statements like that which are evidence of people just so not wanting to deal with the
[2:26:37.240 --> 2:26:52.240]  humiliation of tyranny and slavery that they have to tell themselves all kinds of lies and meanwhile a major university last year rated the u.s. is the sixth worst police state in the world and I talked to french british other people who won't even come here now because
[2:26:52.240 --> 2:27:00.240]  they know what a police state is they're going into one as well but and we're losing most our tourism and still people say no we're free we're free
[2:27:00.240 --> 2:27:15.240]  right right it's it's sad I mean one of the kind of things that really got me thinking about how how sort of sad it was was that after that you know the two thousand election which again I'm I'm certainly just like with a passion George W. Bush and was no
[2:27:15.240 --> 2:27:30.240]  man of Al Gore but the reality was after that election you know that a supreme court justice you know says basically this is a sham he said that we don't know who the hell really want to hear that that nobody should have any confidence in the rule of law these are the
[2:27:30.240 --> 2:27:44.240]  same thing of what of what the you know justice up John Paul Stevens said and you know you would think in any kind of country at all any kind of nation where you have fifty sixty million people voting for a guy you know and they realize they got just totally screwed totally
[2:27:44.240 --> 2:27:58.240]  disenfranchised you'd have a major population out on the street I mean that's what you saw in Iran right you saw not in Iran you saw up to three million people in Iran upset about their their election fraud you saw it in Mexico
[2:27:58.240 --> 2:28:11.240]  and what's happening here in the United States here is why is it that when we have our election jokes are pseudo democratic processes we have even less guts less courage to get out there then these other societies which which we make fun of here
[2:28:11.240 --> 2:28:19.240]  in America as as banana republics or ours as total tyrannies why do they have more guts more courage than we do
[2:28:19.240 --> 2:28:33.240]  coming up I want to get into the psychiatric slash psychological system I mean obviously you can get a pastor or there are a lot of good psychologists who actually help people who are loving but you also get a lot of control freaks a lot of
[2:28:33.240 --> 2:28:51.240]  people that end up abusing their patients and you talk about them being enforcers for this oppressive system I've had psychology today and John Gartner and he wrote an article saying basically I'm a schizophrenic there's no world government I'm lying about everything
[2:28:51.240 --> 2:29:07.240]  and when you really read his piece it is what is mentally ill or purely deceptive I mean if he really believes the things he's saying about me and here's an example coming up over the break Tony Blair was on Fox News yesterday and said it's a conspiracy theory that
[2:29:07.240 --> 2:29:17.240]  that they lied about WMD's they just use that term conspiracy theory for for anything now anything questioning the government
[2:29:17.240 --> 2:29:33.240]  right I mean we've got a long history my profession of a pathologizing medicalizing things that though we don't like that that creates some havoc that that you know that are don't go along with the the official order I mean it goes back to their doctors in the south
[2:29:33.240 --> 2:29:46.240]  during you know before the Civil War there who were who viewed slaves who fled they had some kind of mental illness why would they want to leave a plantation I mean if they didn't have a mental illness and you have I mean just very

[2:33:09.240 --> 2:33:17.240]  in 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi we took a little
[2:33:17.240 --> 2:33:37.240]  a lot has gone into North America's cow like apathy the slovenly sloth likeness that we've turned into we've been decadent we've had it really good for a long time and that always leads to weakness we've been spoiled our children we haven't gone through adversity people don't appreciate things
[2:33:37.240 --> 2:33:53.240]  I think the most important thing of a cornucopia factors and I want Dr. Levine to talk about this because I've read his writings and really think it's very piercing and right along my own research is from studying this and watching it being part of it
[2:33:53.240 --> 2:34:09.240]  the process of awakening people that Madison Avenue and I've read Bernays two books I've read many other books by the big modern fathers of advertising and propaganda and most people know this but they don't consciously real you know put into their decision
[2:34:09.240 --> 2:34:25.240]  making every day and people don't think about it but most people know that Madison Avenue learned about a hundred years ago to make you feel inadequate so they choose a body type on average that women don't look like for thousands of years the full body
[2:34:25.240 --> 2:34:41.240]  voluptuous figure was the most beautiful in every culture it's what I like it's what men like I don't like what modern porn has done in a lot of ways but in one respect it has brought back the real figure men like you know the market has shown they don't want some skinny heroin head
[2:34:41.240 --> 2:34:59.240]  but but but Madison Avenue chose that because then women will feel inadequate they could sell them all the cosmetics the drugs the the diets at the Bernays you know they had women with cigarettes at at rallies they paid them to smoke cigarettes at
[2:34:59.240 --> 2:35:13.240]  meetings where women were trying to get voting suffrage their voting rights and so because it was a good cause overall because they were smoking cigarettes and the cigarette manufacturers funded that they tied it into fake rebellion but but bottom line
[2:35:13.240 --> 2:35:29.240]  they make you feel inadequate men women then they can give you a false image of what it is to be a strong man or woman which actually makes you feel even less empowered and then people just keep doing more and more of what the system says and so people don't see themselves as leaders they
[2:35:29.240 --> 2:35:48.240]  see themselves as trailblazers are role models aren't inventors and civil rights activists and scientists and trailblazers and explorers as America's icons had been previously now it's some drug addict athlete or it's some drug addict actress or it's
[2:35:48.240 --> 2:36:04.240]  the image makers know what they've done and they've told you if you're not twenty two in a blind or you're not you know a twenty five year old basketball star you have no worth and the children are all given false dreams of being something that one out of ten
[2:36:04.240 --> 2:36:16.240]  thousand are going to be able to do or maybe one out of a million in some cases be a movie star and so people feel pathetic about themselves so how could they stand up and be leaders going back to dr Levine go ahead sir
[2:36:16.240 --> 2:36:28.240]  yeah I mean I think there's two really are insidious forces working at the same time one is that there's a you know what you're talking about just kind of making people feel bad about their basic humanity
[2:36:28.240 --> 2:36:48.240]  you know pathologizing medicalizing disease and doing all these kinds of things to make people feel like who they are something problematic one thing happens off of that is that there's a lot of money to be made off of that certainly my profession and I can go through that with you there's also what ends up happening is as folks are making money
[2:36:48.240 --> 2:37:06.240]  you know the powers to be get to have a more kind of a compliant population who feels lousy about themselves so it's in the total interest of the kind of corporate authoritarian kind of society that we have here that that that gets spread and that's why it will it will not be confronted
[2:37:06.240 --> 2:37:22.240]  in any kind of on any kind of mass media I mean for the obvious thing is that they're being supported by all by commercials by all of these kinds of different companies that are selling it but on another level it won't be confronted by any of the powers to be that are on top of this whole hierarchy here because
[2:37:22.240 --> 2:37:32.240]  you know at some level they want a population not really feeling too good about themselves that's not a population that's going to rebel is this not a corporate psychological dictatorship we're living under
[2:37:32.240 --> 2:37:44.240]  well it has been for a pretty long time I give you a one little story here the the the actual the father of the American Psychiatric Association literally I mean if you took a look at their in their their image there
[2:37:44.240 --> 2:37:56.240]  you know that that that that it warns the American Psychiatric Association seal it's a guy named Dr. Benjamin Rush you know he's like signed the declaration of independence and so he's you know they're real proud of him
[2:37:56.240 --> 2:38:09.240]  and what this guy did was in addition to many other crazy treatments that killed a lot of people including George Washington including George Washington yeah yeah yeah I mean one of his illnesses that he came up with was something called
[2:38:09.240 --> 2:38:29.240]  Anarchy which which which he defined as quotes an excessive passion for liberty and it constituted for him a form of insanity so so for him certainly anybody who at the time who was upset about the American rule of revolution going in the way of a more centralized totalitarian kind of society that we've ended up with here today
[2:38:29.240 --> 2:38:42.240]  because what anybody who confronted that they had some kind of disease called anarchy and throughout the whole history of my profession you'll you'll see that and so today I mean no more and more people I used to say this and and guys like you who were interviewing me
[2:38:42.240 --> 2:38:53.240]  they think I'm making this up that I'm being it was being sarcastic but they're but more and more people are hip to the idea that there actually is an illness today in my business called oppositional defiant disorder
[2:38:53.240 --> 2:39:09.240]  ODD and this is not an arcane diagnosis is given often and kids are behaviorally modified no no no no no John Gartner on the phone was basically telling me I had this that you had ODD yeah I mean basically I'm I'm I'm I'm yeah and schizophrenic
[2:39:09.240 --> 2:39:26.240]  well let me tell the audience I would doubt that there's one member of your audience there who does not have the symptoms of ODD I sure as heck I'm proud to have it I mean some of the symptoms that they call an illness are one often argues with adults to often refuses to comply with adults
[2:39:26.240 --> 2:39:46.240]  I mean you know often gets upset and angry with with adults I mean these are these are the symptoms of an illness and you know that's the most odd one and more obvious so-called psychiatric you know so-called illnesses that it's clearly a form of rebellion but if you take a look at almost everything else that has been labeled as a illness or a pathology
[2:39:46.240 --> 2:40:02.240]  you know throughout the history of my business it's it's really either an overt or a covert form of rebellion and and of course it there's much more money and you know to be made by labeling an ill especially nowadays when you drug drug everything and pharmaceutical companies are making a ton
[2:40:02.240 --> 2:40:16.240]  off of off of people's problems and off of people's rebellions but it's also in the benefit for the whole culture and society if you could if you could drug every rebellious kid out there if you could drug every everybody out there who's depressed because
[2:40:16.240 --> 2:40:27.240]  their life is is miserable here because there's no freedom there's no justice there's no autonomy you know if you can drug all of them well not only is there a ton of money to be made out of it but but you quash rebellion
[2:40:27.240 --> 2:40:37.240]  absolutely now pulling back from this I want to get into solutions from your deep research on these subjects but also wanted to just have the parallel to the pimp game
[2:40:37.240 --> 2:40:53.240]  it's the same way a pimp breaks a whore and you know they ask the pimps on television what do you pay your girls I pay him nothing they're lucky if I give him a happy meal or some Kentucky fried chicken and these women are just groveling and begging to these guys
[2:40:53.240 --> 2:41:08.240]  and worshiping them and saying I want to do more more more more more and you look at the way the government all its corruption all the bad things it does it's the authority it's the officials you know we are now the servants of the government it's literally the
[2:41:08.240 --> 2:41:22.240]  government is a pimp and we are now their whore well it seems that way I mean people are getting less and less and less and whatever they've got it is being threatened to be taken away from them and and people are just reacting like
[2:41:22.240 --> 2:41:31.240]  passively I guess I guess that's the way it is I guess I guess that's what always happens so that that kind of psychology that you're describing is actually it seems like it's happening
[2:41:31.240 --> 2:41:45.240]  well how do we recreate 1776 in a peaceful way because the media always demonizes protest puts them in free speech zones hires provocateurs on record to engage in violence in front of news cameras so they can then attack the peaceful crowd
[2:41:45.240 --> 2:41:53.240]  we know that's how they're keeping people from getting out on the streets and involved and they admit they're spying on everybody now so there's this overall chilling effect
[2:41:53.240 --> 2:42:04.240]  somebody like myself and I never thought of myself as particularly a tough guy or even rebellious I don't want to be a slave I don't want my children to be a slave I know the great value is property rights and freedom and all of this
[2:42:04.240 --> 2:42:16.240]  and I and I know an Orwellian police state when I see it because I've studied a lot of history early on I found it to be entertaining is the reason I got deeply into history even in high school but but but now those that know history are not doing to repeat it I guess
[2:42:16.240 --> 2:42:33.240]  the reverse of what Lord Acton said so expanding on that what are some of the solutions you found to get people who are in apathy or who are in learned helplessness or who are in cognitive dissidents to to to unwrap their minds
[2:42:33.240 --> 2:42:48.240]  from this corruption and start standing up I mean my best experiences to teach them we have this hero image of an Arnold Schwarzenegger in the movies or a Clint Eastwood fixing it all John Wayne one guy comes in and does it
[2:42:48.240 --> 2:43:06.240]  but really it's small decisions and valuing yourself and not making them let you feel insecure and pathetic and read prior setting your priorities and helping others I have found that that's how you can build people with small steps up to see their power
[2:43:06.240 --> 2:43:18.240]  right at one level I mean in this again I've written a few books and got many many different ideas and solutions there but try to I'll try to kind of distill it to a few things here if you take a look at the great kind of democratic movements
[2:43:18.240 --> 2:43:36.240]  and there have been in our society and they've had we've had a people's party we've had a populist movement and you take a look at what was going on there you know what you had was people who had individual self respect and what we call collective self confidence they had some faith and they had some trust in other people
[2:43:36.240 --> 2:43:51.240]  okay those are your key ingredients and so what does that mean you know for anybody out there who's listening what can I do here at any given time each day here that restores some of my self respect here you know that gives me even more self respect that's going to give me strength
[2:43:51.240 --> 2:44:07.240]  what can I do each day that gives me more confidence and trust with with with those people around me what can I do to help myself what can I do to help other people I give you one interesting it is at least interesting for me example of a population that you would think out there is going to be one of the
[2:44:07.240 --> 2:44:22.240]  most broken a population most difficult to restore this and who's pulled it off there's a group of folks that you know who contacted me off of my right especially when I wrote common sense rebellion who called themselves psychiatric survivors and I had never heard this term up until say about
[2:44:22.240 --> 2:44:37.240]  1993 94 and so they explained to me that what they were were people who when they were going through some tough times in life especially in their adolescence or you know early adulthood and they had you know they really were overwhelmed by pain for their life
[2:44:37.240 --> 2:44:52.240]  they and and and started acting a little bit bizarrely that they were kind of taken captive by the whole my psychiatrist and instead of people caring about them and let them just chill out and move through a tough stretch in their life they were put in forced treatment psychiatric hospitals for
[2:44:52.240 --> 2:45:08.240]  struggling in some cases forced electroshock I had countless friends in Dallas who would have banker dads insurance salesman dads they'd be playing football on the team they would catch them when they were 15 with one joint and they put them in facilities and straightjacketed
[2:45:08.240 --> 2:45:23.240]  them drug them and when they came out man they got tattoos got on hard drugs and we're gone they actually went the opposite way right yeah a lot of people go all kinds of ways one of that what you're describing some people just become captive to the system for life
[2:45:23.240 --> 2:45:38.240]  okay and just you know buy into their diagnosis buy into their illness you know be gone as social security disability and you know just kind of you know that's their path but there's another kind of group an interesting kind of group most of the
[2:45:38.240 --> 2:45:52.240]  folks probably would know how to find themselves anti-authoritarians some of them libertarians probably more than would define themselves anarchist but I their but their significant populations of these folks that I ran into they've asked me to come and speak and you know one of
[2:45:52.240 --> 2:46:08.240]  the things that I found that they did and you know really instructive thing is what they what they realized was is that we are going to take our problems and not hand them over to authorities anymore that in other words that's what we're one of the major socializations in our society is like if you've got any kind of problems
[2:46:08.240 --> 2:46:22.240]  call in an authority specialist specialist what's that the new priesthood specialist and of course there's all kinds of problems for that but the one thing that I hadn't thought about that they taught me was that you're you're ruining your you're you're you're
[2:46:22.240 --> 2:46:39.240]  you're losing a chance and opportunity by giving your your authorities away to these you know to these faceless interpersonal money-making authors you're losing the opportunity to use that problem that you have to connect with other people and that's exactly what these psychiatric survivors did form their
[2:46:39.240 --> 2:46:53.240]  communities any psychiatrist any psychologist they form their own communities of support of empathy of of learning you know of of of all the kinds of things that you would get you know that that would restore what I talked about individual self-respect
[2:46:53.240 --> 2:47:09.240]  and then again shifting gears shifting gears doctor I want to go back into solutions with you here's an example the tea parties are libertarian slash constitutionalist and real liberals who know the Democratic Party's bad news and then the Republican Party comes in and just takes it over
[2:47:09.240 --> 2:47:27.240]  that's an example of how they don't want us having our own communities here's another you know I go to an event it's all my basically my people there they run psyops run over just you know five of them out of 300 get in my face make a big event out of it select select
[2:47:27.240 --> 2:47:42.240]  select videos out just to make it look like I'm the bad guy to destroy trust in me and I read whether they're doing this through jealousy or come and tell pro then I go and I read the come and tell pro 2000 pages of documents and army warfare manuals
[2:47:42.240 --> 2:48:04.240]  on doing them go into different activist groups in the U.S. tax blaming on them go into different activist groups in the U.S. turn everybody against any organization that gets any size or power so the real mark of a real organization is that the system is going to come after it
[2:48:04.240 --> 2:48:19.240]  and the system knows they want to keep us all balkanized and separate and fighting with each other right and there's and within any organization unfortunately you can always have folks who are willing to sell out for more power for more prestige for more money
[2:48:19.240 --> 2:48:34.240]  and that's what you know we've been very good at are the you know the kind of corporate government partnership domestically and internationally is planning those people who are willing to sell out their people and I guess you know in the in the in the folks who really were genuinely
[2:48:34.240 --> 2:48:54.240]  caring about a government control and had real kind of moral you know ideas about what what they're what the tea party was going to do for them you know that that they should not have been surprised that a bunch of warmongers from the Republican Party were going to come in there and you know and and try to rip them off
[2:48:54.240 --> 2:49:05.240]  and now there's a big fight inside the tea party and the Republicans are saying you don't belong here get out and they're running three people against Ron Paul right now with Republican Party money
[2:49:05.240 --> 2:49:24.240]  you know from what I'm hearing here with Ron Paul was that he was smart enough to sort of realize you know that that the that that the tea party movement was going to be deeply problematic because it was drawing together people who just did not just you know just like government control that there were a lot of folks from the get go in there
[2:49:24.240 --> 2:49:39.240]  unfortunately who are racist I hate to say it but that's true you know there were people in there who were just you know chauvinistic flag waving Americans there were a whole bunch of groups in there who just were you know who were you know against abortion you know against
[2:49:39.240 --> 2:49:56.240]  you know liberty of a woman to you know there there are a whole bunch of different is it was balkanized it was balkanized right and so that's why he's got campaign for liberty that is his views well you know my whole issue is I believe it's a civil right for the
[2:49:56.240 --> 2:50:09.240]  people who have been born but I understand it's become a political football issue but but I don't get mad at people that disagree with me on political views but my whole issue is we know that they want to balkanize they want to divide groups
[2:50:09.240 --> 2:50:23.240]  anybody who's a radio host or a website person who all they do is fight with other people and attack other people and stir up fights that is somebody working for the system and you see the Democrats wanted to make the tea party is all about Republicans
[2:50:23.240 --> 2:50:28.240]  and a self-fulfilling prophecy and that's what the power structure wanted because the two parties really work together
[2:50:28.240 --> 2:50:41.240]  right I mean that's right and that's part of the problem you know that that folks get get manipulated into kind of bickering on relatively relatively minor issues here I mean I'm sure somebody out there who
[2:50:41.240 --> 2:50:57.240]  really cares passionately about whether gay marriage should be allowed or gay civil union is good enough for all of these kinds of issues but these are the powers to be are always going to pick the vice of issues and have people who the majority of people care about
[2:50:57.240 --> 2:51:18.240]  you know getting rid of and they never resolved it right stay there our economy is in great distress the financial dominoes can fall at any time it's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen and prepare just in case it does you have auto and home insurance
[2:51:18.240 --> 2:51:34.240]  why wouldn't you have food insurance are you prepared to feed your family long term because it might take years to recover as the adult it's your responsibility to feed your family especially during rough times

[2:52:04.240 --> 2:52:16.240]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home
[2:52:16.240 --> 2:52:27.240]  and have turned an innocent influence on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[2:52:27.240 --> 2:52:37.240]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[2:52:37.240 --> 2:52:43.240]  Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to

[2:54:20.240 --> 2:54:28.240]  they think it to put you in their private prisons predominantly owned by the big banks that launder the drug money so the drug dealers get to use their drugs and put you in their own prisons
[2:54:28.240 --> 2:54:40.240]  see I drug dealing all of it available at info wars dot com ships out next monday we won the west and I'm in and consulted on it's excellent also you can pre-order Jesse Ventura's new book American conspiracies it's excellent

[2:54:52.240 --> 2:55:07.240]  I know it's informative for myself and for you out there listening I've always told listeners that there's also another byproduct of the government line and corporations line then there's a total loss of faith in everything people stop researching
[2:55:07.240 --> 2:55:20.240]  they just don't believe anything and society collapses look at Mexico look at North Korea Mexico so corrupt they have three times the resources we have but the the culture of corruption people just lay down and don't produce anything that's how they keep from being robbed
[2:55:20.240 --> 2:55:34.240]  that's why the Soviet Union collapsed I tell you that there's co until pro trying to discredit me anybody else that's good you know you're good though you know the world's only going to be better if you get involved and lift other people up you know you can trust yourself
[2:55:34.240 --> 2:55:53.240]  so take action don't get involved in all the infighting and the bitterness and everything that gets pushed in this culture now going back to our guest serve we look at all this what are some other other solutions you found to get people out of their desperation out of their
[2:55:53.240 --> 2:56:09.240]  capitulation to corruption things that I've learned over the years in terms of what it helped me and what what what has been helpful for people I've known and work with is that asking themselves like what you know what are they doing really is a healthy risk
[2:56:09.240 --> 2:56:23.240]  and and usually you know risk to build build some strength for people so you know there's certain things when you when you are like speaking truth in certain areas you are definitely taking some risks you know I you know for me
[2:56:23.240 --> 2:56:41.240]  you know certain times we were where I'm telling colleagues who already get what I'm talking about is just a kind of fun conversation it's enjoyable to do maybe build some community but there's other situations where you're in a situation where where you're you're going to pay a certain price
[2:56:41.240 --> 2:56:56.240]  for a political price an economic price and you're going to do something there then you're going to take a certain risk and that's going to build a certain degree of self respect so I think generally you know what what can you do out there to kind of like build yourself some support
[2:56:56.240 --> 2:57:10.240]  how can you kind of eliminate people in your life who really don't get it will never get it and are really going to be trying to undermine you and abuse you and make you feel less and how are you going to find people out there who are going to be you know validating
[2:57:10.240 --> 2:57:27.240]  supportive so you're saying don't put up with backstabbers and backbiders and and really negative people get a better peer group get into a group of healthier people and challenge yourself don't just preach to the choir go out there and build your confidence those are a couple of major areas
[2:57:27.240 --> 2:57:43.240]  yes continue well I think just in general on you know specifically you know for a lot of people out there who are like yeah don't don't believe that they can't do anything out there that they don't respect that the whole employment
[2:57:43.240 --> 2:57:58.240]  a world out there is one where they have to like lose complete integrity you know that's unfortunately rough for a lot of us out there that we have to eat or eat crow a lot and so one of the things I tell folks is that you know hey if you have to because your kids are going to starve to death
[2:57:58.240 --> 2:58:13.240]  hey that's okay but don't kid yourself when you're doing it just for some extra confidence some extra security again you know just take wherever you can intelligent risks I mean a big thing is that school and school
[2:58:13.240 --> 2:58:26.240]  I have to you know that's a whole other topic of how that breaks people school I would say school television and the mental health profession are some of the big areas that really break young people but one of the things that you know that that life is very different than school
[2:58:26.240 --> 2:58:33.240]  life's not going to give you an F for failure okay life is going to reward you you know for taking some risks
[2:58:33.240 --> 2:58:42.240]  Doctor we got five minutes left we got five minutes left a one minute break we're going to come back let's talk about those three pillars of control
[2:58:42.240 --> 2:58:53.240]  America's number one stories for independent talk radio for over a decade we are the GCN radio network
[2:58:53.240 --> 2:59:01.240]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history
[2:59:01.240 --> 2:59:06.240]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home
[2:59:06.240 --> 2:59:12.240]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots
[2:59:12.240 --> 2:59:17.240]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[2:59:17.240 --> 2:59:27.240]  the fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[2:59:27.240 --> 2:59:33.240]  Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to
[2:59:33.240 --> 2:59:40.240]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic
[2:59:40.240 --> 2:59:51.240]  get your copy of fall of the republic on DVD at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[2:59:51.240 --> 3:00:02.240]  Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[3:00:02.240 --> 3:00:10.240]  okay coming up in the next segment news blitz and more of your phone calls
[3:00:10.240 --> 3:00:19.240]  T info coming up Dr. Bruce E. Levine is our guest websites www.brucelevine.com.net
[3:00:19.240 --> 3:00:26.240]  excuse me Bruce Levine.net that it linked up on info wars dot com and prisonplanet.com
[3:00:26.240 --> 3:00:31.240]  he's an author just search his name a lot of great research okay so in the last five minutes we've got with you sir
[3:00:31.240 --> 3:00:39.240]  you were talking about the three big pillars of mind control of oppression school TV and mental health
[3:00:39.240 --> 3:00:43.240]  people don't even communicate with each other anymore four and a half hours of TV and it's growing
[3:00:43.240 --> 3:00:49.240]  I guess just turning the TV off as one giant step towards freedom my god yeah that's the easiest thing that you could do
[3:00:49.240 --> 3:00:55.240]  I mean out there if you've got any kind of strength any kind of energy left I mean you know just watch you know as little
[3:00:55.240 --> 3:01:01.240]  television as you possibly can it's not just the content that's killing you what it does is it just kind of affects
[3:01:01.240 --> 3:01:07.240]  your brain waves it puts you in this kind of passive hypnotized state and it's just one of the most highly
[3:01:07.240 --> 3:01:14.240]  pacifying things that they've ever come up with here to control the population again it's not just the content
[3:01:14.240 --> 3:01:20.240]  continuum well school I mean you know it's one of the kinds of things that that that you can't get an issue that
[3:01:20.240 --> 3:01:25.240]  more democrats more republicans to totally shake hands and agree on you know I mean if you take a look at the
[3:01:25.240 --> 3:01:31.240]  no child left behind that you know you got George W. Bush want to throw more money at that you know
[3:01:31.240 --> 3:01:36.240]  Obama loves school you know there's nothing that these guys love Morris then school why is that because
[3:01:36.240 --> 3:01:42.240]  forever people have known you know from you know I mean it's not just Bruce Levine here it's like from
[3:01:42.240 --> 3:01:48.240]  Thorough to you know from H. L. Makin anybody who thought critically at all about school understands
[3:01:48.240 --> 3:01:54.240]  not the place where most people get any kind of education it's just a place to um to kind of subdue them
[3:01:54.240 --> 3:01:59.240]  um you know one thing if you guys have never had on your show here uh John Teller Gatto there's an
[3:01:59.240 --> 3:02:05.240]  interesting guy who actually won the New York City Teachers of the Year award and we had a 90 and then
[3:02:05.240 --> 3:02:10.240]  he basically kind of like laughed at what a joke it was I give you a one quick quote here from him
[3:02:10.240 --> 3:02:17.240]  from Mr. Gatto here he says he says I've noticed a fascinating phenomenon in my 25 years of teaching
[3:02:17.240 --> 3:02:22.240]  that schools and schooling are increasingly irrelevant to the great enterprises of the planet
[3:02:22.240 --> 3:02:28.240]  no one believes anymore that scientists are trained in science classes or politicians and civics classes
[3:02:28.240 --> 3:02:34.240]  or poets and English classes the truth is that schools don't really teach anything except how to obey
[3:02:34.240 --> 3:02:40.240]  orders okay most critically thinking kids know that most people realize that the way you learn things
[3:02:40.240 --> 3:02:45.240]  is not in a classroom it's on your own you know that's certainly on how every almost everything I was
[3:02:45.240 --> 3:02:50.240]  taught you know in classrooms about psychology it's just basically a way to kind of you know not
[3:02:50.240 --> 3:02:57.240]  well schools schools 3000 years ago were all at local temples that taught certain so-called
[3:02:57.240 --> 3:03:03.240]  sciences and they were cults they were secret societies of knowledge and now it's just a way to get people
[3:03:03.240 --> 3:03:08.240]  in debt and keep all these young people from starting their own businesses going in their own directions
[3:03:08.240 --> 3:03:14.240]  we see almost all the big inventors and people never even went to college because they
[3:03:14.240 --> 3:03:18.240]  you're making a you're making a good point here it's like this is this is these guys that I'm talking about
[3:03:18.240 --> 3:03:23.240]  we're just criticizing high school but now now is you've got more kind of like pressuring people and
[3:03:23.240 --> 3:03:28.240]  shaming people that they have to go to college you've at the same time if you're jacking up their
[3:03:28.240 --> 3:03:34.240]  debt and their interest rates and and you know you've completely created almost a new indentured
[3:03:34.240 --> 3:03:39.240]  servant population of folks who are pressured and forced to go to schools because they were told
[3:03:39.240 --> 3:03:42.240]  that you know that they're never going to be able to survive out there with a college education
[3:03:42.240 --> 3:03:47.240]  and they're stalled from entering the workforce right right and and you know they and and you know
[3:03:47.240 --> 3:03:51.240]  it takes you know it's very hard once you that's another way to really oppress and subdue a
[3:03:51.240 --> 3:03:55.240]  population give them a pile of debt and that's what they're doing you know that's what our
[3:03:55.240 --> 3:04:00.240]  society is doing to to what should be the most rebellious population you're young adults and
[3:04:00.240 --> 3:04:04.240]  they're not rebelling very much because they're all terrified they're all filled with not only
[3:04:04.240 --> 3:04:08.240]  a student that credit card did everything like that and it's just like for them is that they're
[3:04:08.240 --> 3:04:15.240]  just drowning in that man you really are speaking the truth because the only good reason to go to
[3:04:15.240 --> 3:04:21.240]  school is to meet like-minded people that are into the same thing maybe meet your mate I mean it
[3:04:21.240 --> 3:04:27.240]  really is worthless right I mean it was a good deal if you were if you're rich you know you
[3:04:27.240 --> 3:04:31.240]  know hey and daddy's gonna pay for it you know it was an okay deal you know you get drunk you
[3:04:31.240 --> 3:04:36.240]  have some fun meet some meet some people from the opposite sex and you know in my day before
[3:04:36.240 --> 3:04:40.240]  you know where you still had public institutions where you didn't have to pay which is me if you
[3:04:40.240 --> 3:04:44.240]  were working class which is what you know I was you know dad worked for the post office there
[3:04:44.240 --> 3:04:48.240]  were public institutions that didn't cost me any money to go it was a pretty good deal to spend
[3:04:48.240 --> 3:04:52.240]  three four well hold on also in the past doctor you had to go to a school because that's where
[3:04:52.240 --> 3:04:56.240]  the books were kept now we have the internet you know what let me twist your arm for five more

[3:08:07.240 --> 3:08:14.240]  the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[3:08:14.240 --> 3:08:20.240]  I talked to Darrell rundist this morning we found out why you do news dot com went down
[3:08:20.240 --> 3:08:24.240]  it got hacked out of the Netherlands so he's getting that back up appreciate Darrell rundist
[3:08:24.240 --> 3:08:28.240]  and all his great work okay I'm gonna do a few more minutes with Dr. Bruce E. Levine
[3:08:28.240 --> 3:08:35.240]  really appreciate him joining us the website's www.bruselavine.net, L-E-V-I-N-E
[3:08:35.240 --> 3:08:39.240]  and really interesting info I probably agree with about 95% of what he's talking about
[3:08:39.240 --> 3:08:45.240]  the point is veritas is veritas it is common sense and I've read the establishments books
[3:08:45.240 --> 3:08:50.240]  about how they're manipulating us they get off on the power of just being able to lie to you
[3:08:50.240 --> 3:08:55.240]  and you accepting it and they like it even more if you just drop out and and don't resist them
[3:08:55.240 --> 3:08:59.240]  that's why they're setting the precedent to lie and lie and lie but but talking about
[3:08:59.240 --> 3:09:05.240]  psychiatry the psychological system from the inception it was set up to control society
[3:09:05.240 --> 3:09:09.240]  it was used by the Nazis and the Soviets and the communist Chinese and our country
[3:09:09.240 --> 3:09:15.240]  and eugenics was run by the psychiatrist in many respects to sterilize people
[3:09:15.240 --> 3:09:20.240]  and you know the highest rate of suicides of any profession from the numbers I've seen
[3:09:20.240 --> 3:09:26.240]  are psychologists and psychiatrists a lot of them are crazier than a you know what rat
[3:09:26.240 --> 3:09:33.240]  I mean there and of course there's a lot of good ones too I guess union or you know other
[3:09:33.240 --> 3:09:38.240]  Carl Jung and I don't even know that I'm saying I totally agree with all that either
[3:09:38.240 --> 3:09:44.240]  I'm just saying it's not all bad but what the big corporations push and promote is the most
[3:09:44.240 --> 3:09:50.240]  virulent form because when I was talking to this John Gartner for psychology today
[3:09:50.240 --> 3:09:54.240]  I mean he was very childlike I would say so you don't you say I'm crazy there's no
[3:09:54.240 --> 3:09:58.240]  world government I said can I send you a hundred articles Times of London saying
[3:09:58.240 --> 3:10:02.240]  world government by banks and he would just say so you believe it's real are they
[3:10:02.240 --> 3:10:07.240]  coming to get you and I said look this isn't a joke sir globalization is real
[3:10:07.240 --> 3:10:14.240]  and he just kept and it's like a game I mean he had it's like a mind trick I mean
[3:10:14.240 --> 3:10:20.240]  it's like it's like I just don't know how to explain it to have them and you know
[3:10:20.240 --> 3:10:26.240]  they know that they're lying but they are like the torture of a of Winston in 1984
[3:10:26.240 --> 3:10:30.240]  it doesn't matter they're in control they're in the power structure and they
[3:10:30.240 --> 3:10:34.240]  don't care if you're really right because they believe perceptions reality they say
[3:10:34.240 --> 3:10:38.240]  two plus two equals a million it does and you're wrong if you say it equals four
[3:10:38.240 --> 3:10:43.240]  closing comments on that third pillar the whole psychological system yeah I think
[3:10:43.240 --> 3:10:46.240]  that the well you know if you again go through not just oppositional defined
[3:10:46.240 --> 3:10:50.240]  disorder and anarchy or one of things if you want to tweak them next time Alex
[3:10:50.240 --> 3:10:55.240]  and say how come you guys like had homosexuality as a mental illness up until
[3:10:55.240 --> 3:11:00.240]  the 1970s what why did it get in your your your diagnostic Bible the DSM and
[3:11:00.240 --> 3:11:03.240]  why did it get out well it got in there for purely political reasons and it got
[3:11:03.240 --> 3:11:07.240]  out because a bunch of gay psychiatrists didn't like be called mentally ill so
[3:11:07.240 --> 3:11:12.240]  almost everything in their pathological Bible called the DSM is in there for
[3:11:12.240 --> 3:11:16.240]  political reasons okay and it gets taken out very rarely things get taken out more
[3:11:16.240 --> 3:11:19.240]  things get added in there once in a while they do get taken out it's all
[3:11:19.240 --> 3:11:23.240]  political and I think that you know one of things that that that was clear to me
[3:11:23.240 --> 3:11:27.240]  in ten years of hanging around in academic training you know getting my
[3:11:27.240 --> 3:11:31.240]  undergraduate degree and getting my graduate degrees was that that that two
[3:11:31.240 --> 3:11:35.240]  populations of people that I've met in my life that are the most compliant are
[3:11:35.240 --> 3:11:39.240]  school teachers and mental health professionals and they tend to you
[3:11:39.240 --> 3:11:43.240]  know whenever they see anybody out there who's not compliant whether they're
[3:11:43.240 --> 3:11:48.240]  actively non-compliant or they're more passively non-compliant they did that
[3:11:48.240 --> 3:11:51.240]  those kind of people make them very anxious and if you're a mental health
[3:11:51.240 --> 3:11:55.240]  professional if your psychiatrist or psychiatrist when you when you're anxious
[3:11:55.240 --> 3:12:00.240]  you know you tend to pathologize you tend to be a disease somebody if you're if
[3:12:00.240 --> 3:12:03.240]  you're a cop you get to you know call somebody a criminal and the two you know
[3:12:03.240 --> 3:12:08.240]  two major ways that American society has really kind of controlled people who
[3:12:08.240 --> 3:12:14.240]  are people who are trying to not labeling are criminalizing them and to
[3:12:14.240 --> 3:12:18.240]  pathologize them I mean those are two great ways to do that and so if you if
[3:12:18.240 --> 3:12:23.240]  you're in a society who do you want to have as your teachers and who do you
[3:12:23.240 --> 3:12:26.240]  want to have as your mental health professionals those most compliant
[3:12:26.240 --> 3:12:30.240]  members of society now again across the board there are exceptions I mentioned
[3:12:30.240 --> 3:12:33.240]  one teacher John you know Gatto and there are mental health professionals who
[3:12:33.240 --> 3:12:37.240]  are exceptions but they are rare let me throw this in everybody remembers
[3:12:37.240 --> 3:12:41.240]  their favorite teacher and I had this football coach who was also the US
[3:12:41.240 --> 3:12:45.240]  history teacher and he later I found out he really knew what he was talking
[3:12:45.240 --> 3:12:50.240]  about he was talking about big banks gunboat diplomacy this schools run is
[3:12:50.240 --> 3:12:54.240]  funded and run by corporate ideas as a public school you know to make you
[3:12:54.240 --> 3:12:59.240]  compliant you may want college but for a lot of you won't be good it's just a
[3:12:59.240 --> 3:13:03.240]  way to get you in debt and everybody loved him but then most the other teachers
[3:13:03.240 --> 3:13:07.240]  were these control freaks who got off on the structure got off on the power and
[3:13:07.240 --> 3:13:11.240]  they were threatened by anybody that even could correct them who was a
[3:13:11.240 --> 3:13:17.240]  student they they they reveled in being part of this this hive or this Borg
[3:13:17.240 --> 3:13:21.240]  right the selection process for teachers and even more so for my
[3:13:21.240 --> 3:13:26.240]  profession psychologist psychiatrist the selection process weeds out on
[3:13:26.240 --> 3:13:30.240]  non-compliant people okay and then once if somebody can flip through the gates
[3:13:30.240 --> 3:13:33.240]  they happen to flip through the gates because they have these great tests or
[3:13:33.240 --> 3:13:37.240]  whatever and that the whole socialization process you know tries to make
[3:13:37.240 --> 3:13:40.240]  these people feel like I'll tell you a term that I heard over and over again
[3:13:40.240 --> 3:13:44.240]  was like you have issues with authority you have issues with authority and
[3:13:44.240 --> 3:13:47.240]  you know I would come back with what's wrong with that well that's that's
[3:13:47.240 --> 3:13:51.240]  enough of a problem to get you kicked out of a program whether it's a teaching
[3:13:51.240 --> 3:13:55.240]  program or being a psychologist I saw it happen all the time and some of the
[3:13:55.240 --> 3:13:58.240]  more courageous critically thinking gutsy kind of people who you would have
[3:13:58.240 --> 3:14:02.240]  liked to have as your counselor you know those people they just never make it
[3:14:02.240 --> 3:14:06.240]  all the way till the end and that's just that's just the way it is you know it
[3:14:06.240 --> 3:14:09.240]  just they're very there's exceptions every once in a while there's some
[3:14:09.240 --> 3:14:12.240]  there's a there's a couple of famous psychologists like I just people like
[3:14:12.240 --> 3:14:16.240]  Eric from who who you know who who saw all these things there's certain
[3:14:16.240 --> 3:14:20.240]  teachers like that but overall it's a these are these are professions that
[3:14:20.240 --> 3:14:26.240]  that socialize and select people to be very very very compliant is it a power
[3:14:26.240 --> 3:14:30.240]  trip I mean because I've interviewed establishment psychologist and
[3:14:30.240 --> 3:14:34.240]  psychiatrist and you can have the Wall Street Journal the New York Times
[3:14:34.240 --> 3:14:38.240]  well in fact I'm going to let you go in a second I want to play this short clip
[3:14:38.240 --> 3:14:41.240]  for you because do you guys have Tony Blair with the conspiracy theorist
[3:14:41.240 --> 3:14:46.240]  comments cue that up because I have Fox News right here and I have the UK Daily
[3:14:46.240 --> 3:14:51.240]  Mail about it and he basically said we're conspiracy theorist if we think
[3:14:51.240 --> 3:14:55.240]  that they lied about WMD's when everyone knows they lied about them we have
[3:14:55.240 --> 3:14:59.240]  the White House and Downing Street Memo I mean they know it's a fraud but
[3:14:59.240 --> 3:15:03.240]  they use these labels go ahead yeah I mean right I mean that's that's the
[3:15:03.240 --> 3:15:07.240]  you know the most obvious thing where we heard that this is obvious thing that
[3:15:07.240 --> 3:15:10.240]  they of course they lied about WMD's but I'll give you another one a more
[3:15:10.240 --> 3:15:14.240]  personal example when Ernest Hemingway towards the end of his life he was
[3:15:14.240 --> 3:15:19.240]  very depressed and he started saying stuff like I think you know the FBI is
[3:15:19.240 --> 3:15:23.240]  listening to me well he got accused then or diagnosed or labeled as being
[3:15:23.240 --> 3:15:27.240]  psychotically depressed having delusions and paranoid so not only did they
[3:15:27.240 --> 3:15:31.240]  drug him but they started a lecture shock on them well years later people
[3:15:31.240 --> 3:15:34.240]  looked in your freedom of information act and because Hemingway had spent
[3:15:34.240 --> 3:15:38.240]  some time in Cuba you know that they actually FBI was bugging him alright
[3:15:38.240 --> 3:15:42.240]  and so you know a lot of it look look look if you've sold 20 million books
[3:15:42.240 --> 3:15:45.240]  and worship the government they're listening to you all the declassified
[3:15:45.240 --> 3:15:49.240]  documents admit they come in and sit in in big churches that aren't even
[3:15:49.240 --> 3:15:54.240]  political right right and nowadays I mean with with so many folks who are like
[3:15:54.240 --> 3:15:58.240]  you know in in you know in in these kind of security positions and so few
[3:15:58.240 --> 3:16:01.240]  people who are rebelling out there I'm sure they've got plenty of people they
[3:16:01.240 --> 3:16:06.240]  got more people for each for each one of Alex Jones is out there they've got
[3:16:06.240 --> 3:16:10.240]  more folks who are listening in their folks who are actually rebelling and
[3:16:10.240 --> 3:16:13.240]  they admit that well I remember five years ago they were calling a
[3:16:13.240 --> 3:16:17.240]  conspiracy theory that Bush was listening to Americans without warrants and he
[3:16:17.240 --> 3:16:21.240]  said I promise you I'm not doing it later it came out he was lying right you
[3:16:21.240 --> 3:16:25.240]  know and a more subtle level even the kind of people I've talked to you know
[3:16:25.240 --> 3:16:28.240]  in a more personal level who've been accused of being delusional and
[3:16:28.240 --> 3:16:31.240]  psychotic and having conspiracy theories because they're saying their their
[3:16:31.240 --> 3:16:35.240]  their spouses are are trying to poison their food well you know often that
[3:16:35.240 --> 3:16:39.240]  they're wrong in the exact fact that their spouse isn't trying to poison their food
[3:16:39.240 --> 3:16:42.240]  but you know what when you get into these people's lives it turns out their spouse
[3:16:42.240 --> 3:16:45.240]  maybe really does wish that they would be dead that they really don't like them
[3:16:45.240 --> 3:16:49.240]  and they're not they're not even folks you know who are there there's very few
[3:16:49.240 --> 3:16:53.240]  folks I meet out there who are completely crazy although they may not have
[3:16:53.240 --> 3:16:57.240]  exactly all the facts there's usually something that's traumatized them that
[3:16:57.240 --> 3:17:02.240]  then triggers the paranoia right right exactly and that's what I found and
[3:17:02.240 --> 3:17:06.240]  and that's how co-intell pro works they want us to all get paranoid we just got
[3:17:06.240 --> 3:17:09.240]  to have trust and that comes from courage and just say we're going to get out in
[3:17:09.240 --> 3:17:12.240]  the community we're going to be involved we're not going to let police
[3:17:12.240 --> 3:17:17.240]  intimidating us or provocateurs stop us we've got to do this let me play the
[3:17:17.240 --> 3:17:21.240]  short clip and I'll let you go here is here is Tony Blair last night on Fox
[3:17:21.240 --> 3:17:26.240]  News here it is I don't pretend for a moment to understand American politics
[3:17:26.240 --> 3:17:31.240]  very well I certainly don't understand British politics but why so many of
[3:17:31.240 --> 3:17:36.240]  these inquiries there's been four and they've all been relentless they they
[3:17:36.240 --> 3:17:47.240]  haven't really mined any new ground I think it's partly because we have this
[3:17:47.240 --> 3:17:51.240]  curious habit I don't think this is confined to Britain actually where people
[3:17:51.240 --> 3:17:57.240]  find it hard to come to the point where they say we disagree you're a reasonable
[3:17:57.240 --> 3:18:02.240]  person I'm a reasonable person but we disagree it there's always got to be a
[3:18:02.240 --> 3:18:07.240]  scandal as to why you hold your view there's got to be some conspiracy behind
[3:18:07.240 --> 3:18:16.240]  it some great you know deceit that's gone on and people just find it hard to
[3:18:16.240 --> 3:18:22.240]  understand right there we have all the memos we have the Niger uranium cake the
[3:18:22.240 --> 3:18:26.240]  aluminum tubes we know Bush and Blair met and Blair said you can't do this and
[3:18:26.240 --> 3:18:29.240]  Bush said we're already doing it they said well how do we make something up I
[3:18:29.240 --> 3:18:33.240]  mean we know and he just says oh people have to believe there's something else
[3:18:33.240 --> 3:18:37.240]  they've had four inquiries because he keeps lying I mean he's caught red handed
[3:18:37.240 --> 3:18:42.240]  saying we're basically mentally ill yeah I mean right I mean that's one of the
[3:18:42.240 --> 3:18:45.240]  most obvious things that people should hold on to that's just right right out
[3:18:45.240 --> 3:18:49.240]  there these guys you know you know there's all kinds of facts from every
[3:18:49.240 --> 3:18:53.240]  different source setting that these guys wanted to go into war in Iraq and and
[3:18:53.240 --> 3:18:56.240]  these guys were looking for every kind of reason that they could come up with
[3:18:56.240 --> 3:19:00.240]  make up any anything and we know that this whole weapons of mass destruction
[3:19:00.240 --> 3:19:05.240]  thing was was fabricated so if there's anything out there that's just been a
[3:19:05.240 --> 3:19:10.240]  proven you know true conspiracy it's this thing here and so that should tell
[3:19:10.240 --> 3:19:14.240]  folks well maybe every kind of the specifics of every conspiracy theory
[3:19:14.240 --> 3:19:18.240]  here are in true but these things actually do happen where there's folks to
[3:19:18.240 --> 3:19:22.240]  be a powers to be are conspiring with things for their own financial and
[3:19:22.240 --> 3:19:27.240]  power you know advantages which is the way it's always been an amazing hour and

[3:22:26.240 --> 3:22:30.240]  ever experienced this is not only a transfer of power to an institution

[3:24:04.240 --> 3:24:08.240]  Steven we're hearing tonight from two victims of a scandal involving a veteran
[3:24:08.240 --> 3:24:13.240]  FHP officer sources tell CBS for a trooper Paul Lawrence has been fired after
[3:24:13.240 --> 3:24:18.240]  his arrest for writing fake tickets 850 traffic citations he issued are
[3:24:18.240 --> 3:24:23.240]  under review many of them have already been dismissed it's kind of sad
[3:24:23.240 --> 3:24:27.240]  because these are the people we look up to you know this is law enforcement I
[3:24:27.240 --> 3:24:31.240]  mean who else are we gonna go to if we don't have them and now you seem like
[3:24:31.240 --> 3:24:35.240]  you can't trust them what are we gonna do well it's unjust I don't think it's
[3:24:35.240 --> 3:24:40.240]  the right thing when you have law enforcement doing this type of you
[3:24:40.240 --> 3:24:44.240]  know this type of work you know I work for D Landage Chrysler Jeep I have a
[3:24:44.240 --> 3:24:50.240]  management position and my license depends on my on my on my job and I
[3:24:50.240 --> 3:24:55.240]  got stopped for no reason super Lawrence is accused of writing the fake tickets
[3:24:55.240 --> 3:24:59.240]  to boost the number of citations he was reporting even though FHP says they
[3:24:59.240 --> 3:25:06.240]  have no quota requirements okay we've got scores of videos every day that
[3:25:06.240 --> 3:25:10.240]  the police look horrible we don't play most of them because I figured out it
[3:25:10.240 --> 3:25:14.240]  plays into the hands of the establishment because then it divides the
[3:25:14.240 --> 3:25:17.240]  people from the police even more and then the police start persecuting the
[3:25:17.240 --> 3:25:21.240]  population even more but we do expose the corruption it's just we don't obsess
[3:25:21.240 --> 3:25:25.240]  over it particularly that because we understand the larger psychological
[3:25:25.240 --> 3:25:30.240]  warfare operation but notice here they did the right thing with the guy
[3:25:30.240 --> 3:25:34.240]  writing fake tickets but then they go ahead and lie and say there's not a quota
[3:25:34.240 --> 3:25:38.240]  it's come out that every police department has an unwritten quota you get
[3:25:38.240 --> 3:25:42.240]  promoted for tickets you right and it just so happens that I had cruise control
[3:25:42.240 --> 3:25:46.240]  on a Chevy truck with standard tires wasn't bigger tires or something I was
[3:25:46.240 --> 3:25:52.240]  doing 60 and a 60 on cruise control this is years ago in college I got pulled
[3:25:52.240 --> 3:25:57.240]  over by state police in north Texas and they got mad I said I had this on cruise
[3:25:57.240 --> 3:26:02.240]  control there's no way I was going above 60 and they started threatening me and
[3:26:02.240 --> 3:26:05.240]  the point is they went in and gave me the ticket and there was their word
[3:26:05.240 --> 3:26:10.240]  against mine and there are quotas and it's wrong and we shouldn't have this
[3:26:10.240 --> 3:26:14.240]  type of stuff going on but they throw the book at the American people but the
[3:26:14.240 --> 3:26:18.240]  illegal aliens get let go for speeding in most cases they get let go for drunk
[3:26:18.240 --> 3:26:22.240]  driving or they get arrested they get a $1 or $50 depending on the case I've
[3:26:22.240 --> 3:26:27.240]  seen $25 fines $1 fines I'm really getting upset by this double standard
[3:26:27.240 --> 3:26:33.240]  and it just shows what a lawless corrupt government that we have in this
[3:26:33.240 --> 3:26:39.240]  society and how the police have got it in their heads more and more especially
[3:26:39.240 --> 3:26:43.240]  in big departments that it's okay to do these type of things remember the cop
[3:26:43.240 --> 3:26:52.240]  the state police in Oklahoma where they beat up the DM the ambulance driver
[3:26:52.240 --> 3:26:58.240]  this woman's having a heart attack the cop pulls up on about 100 miles an
[3:26:58.240 --> 3:27:01.240]  hour they try to get over on the side of the road out of his way they
[3:27:01.240 --> 3:27:05.240]  instantly pull over he goes to this place he had to go to nothing's happened
[3:27:05.240 --> 3:27:09.240]  in there at a gas station chases them down through neighborhoods at over
[3:27:09.240 --> 3:27:13.240]  80 miles an hour through residential pull him over and they get out and say
[3:27:13.240 --> 3:27:17.240]  what's the problem and the guy starts screaming at him you need to learn to
[3:27:17.240 --> 3:27:22.240]  get out of my way just on a crazy power trip and the state police lied before
[3:27:22.240 --> 3:27:26.240]  the videos were fully released and said that the black man the black ambulance
[3:27:26.240 --> 3:27:32.240]  driver had assaulted him and then it turned out he did nothing the cop
[3:27:32.240 --> 3:27:36.240]  grabbed him and the guy pulled his hand back that's assault hey man we're
[3:27:36.240 --> 3:27:41.240]  human beings you're not God and I know most police aren't like this but you
[3:27:41.240 --> 3:27:45.240]  got vets coming home waterboarding they're six year olds because they can't do
[3:27:45.240 --> 3:27:49.240]  their ABC's you got vets killing their husbands killing their wives because
[3:27:49.240 --> 3:27:53.240]  they've served 234 tours they weren't cut out for it they've flown over the
[3:27:53.240 --> 3:27:57.240]  cuckoo's nest and most of them what is it 70 plus percent of cops are now
[3:27:57.240 --> 3:28:02.240]  former combat vets a lot of these guys have got screws loose ladies and
[3:28:02.240 --> 3:28:07.240]  gentlemen and they've got guns and they've got all this authority and
[3:28:07.240 --> 3:28:10.240]  they're protected when they do bad things to people turned out that guy in
[3:28:10.240 --> 3:28:15.240]  Oklahoma was a vet I mean he's going to a response for a fight at a gas station
[3:28:15.240 --> 3:28:19.240]  and you see him going at least a hundred I mean way up there's this ambulance on
[3:28:19.240 --> 3:28:24.240]  windy roads he flies up behind him within one second the ambulance pulls out
[3:28:24.240 --> 3:28:32.240]  into the media over to the grass he shoots past him and it's just incredible
[3:28:32.240 --> 3:28:35.240]  and they're having to be a stalled car in the side of the road they almost
[3:28:35.240 --> 3:28:40.240]  smashed into that then he drives like a maniac through the neighborhood and
[3:28:40.240 --> 3:28:44.240]  I've seen footage after footage of cops beating people up and they don't even
[3:28:44.240 --> 3:28:48.240]  resist them beating them up and then they get charged with assaulting them and
[3:28:48.240 --> 3:28:53.240]  cops know they're doing this cops if you've been given the power to engage in
[3:28:53.240 --> 3:28:57.240]  this type of corruption what do you think your bosses are who do you think they
[3:28:57.240 --> 3:29:01.240]  are and then their bosses and their bosses it just gets more and more evil
[3:29:01.240 --> 3:29:07.240]  the higher up you go and the media uses examples of good cops that get in
[3:29:07.240 --> 3:29:10.240]  trouble for not doing bad things to make us feel sorry for the police when in
[3:29:10.240 --> 3:29:16.240]  truth that's some good cop who made the system mad so they're persecuting
[3:29:16.240 --> 3:29:19.240]  see I mean I figured out how this whole system works and then I've gone and
[3:29:19.240 --> 3:29:22.240]  researched separate books written by police chiefs and others and it turns
[3:29:22.240 --> 3:29:27.240]  out what I have instinctively discovered is exactly what they're doing it's

[3:33:20.240 --> 3:33:25.240]  united states europe and japan they believe no one can stand in their way
[3:33:25.240 --> 3:33:31.240]  in short the new world order is a global corporate takeover in their global
[3:33:31.240 --> 3:33:38.240]  corporate state there is no room for individuality sovereignty or independence
[3:33:38.240 --> 3:33:43.240]  as their program begins to face more and more opposition lawmakers and
[3:33:43.240 --> 3:33:48.240]  supporters of the man-made global warming hypothesis want laws to be passed
[3:33:48.240 --> 3:33:54.240]  making it illegal to question their theories recently the head of green
[3:33:54.240 --> 3:33:59.240]  peace was forced to admit that the arctic and Antarctic ice caps grow in the
[3:33:59.240 --> 3:34:04.240]  winter and shrink in the summer and that this is all part of a natural process
[3:34:04.240 --> 3:34:10.240]  driven by the tilt of the earth and the sun the cosmic radiation coming from
[3:34:10.240 --> 3:34:16.240]  space the amount reaching the earth is affected by the strength of the sun's
[3:34:16.240 --> 3:34:20.240]  magnetic field so the magnetic field of the sun is almost like a gateway
[3:34:20.240 --> 3:34:26.240]  controlling the cosmic radiation reaching the earth the magnetic strength
[3:34:26.240 --> 3:34:33.240]  of the sun is also related to the number of sunspots so they are directly
[3:34:33.240 --> 3:34:38.240]  related to changes within the inner structure of the sun the amount of
[3:34:38.240 --> 3:34:44.240]  cosmic radiation reaching the lower atmosphere creates more cloud right
[3:34:44.240 --> 3:34:51.240]  and cloud forms you need to have what are called condensation nuclei that is
[3:34:51.240 --> 3:34:55.240]  little particles around which water can change from water vapor gas into
[3:34:55.240 --> 3:35:00.240]  water droplets minute particles that are visible in the form of clouds we've
[3:35:00.240 --> 3:35:07.240]  known for a long time that there was more cloud than the amount of particles
[3:35:07.240 --> 3:35:11.240]  in the atmosphere because we assumed it was clay particles and salt particles
[3:35:11.240 --> 3:35:19.240]  that were creating this condensation process but there was this gap we now
[3:35:19.240 --> 3:35:23.240]  realize of course it's the cosmic radiation that's doing it so what the
[3:35:23.240 --> 3:35:27.240]  cosmic radiation is doing controlled by the magnetic field of the sun is
[3:35:27.240 --> 3:35:31.240]  putting up it's like putting up a screen in the greenhouse and blocking out
[3:35:31.240 --> 3:35:35.240]  the sunlight and of course that then affects the temperature of the earth
[3:35:35.240 --> 3:35:40.240]  that's why there's a relationship between the sunspots and the temperature
[3:35:40.240 --> 3:35:45.240]  on the earth so we now know the mechanism but they completely ignore that
[3:35:45.240 --> 3:35:50.240]  more than 31,000 scientists from across the United States including more than
[3:35:50.240 --> 3:35:56.240]  9,000 PhDs from the fields of climatology atmospheric science earth
[3:35:56.240 --> 3:36:01.240]  science and hydrology signed a petition rejecting man-made global warming
[3:36:01.240 --> 3:36:07.240]  as a scientific fraud this shattered the hoax of the so-called consensus that
[3:36:07.240 --> 3:36:12.240]  the mainstream media had been pushing for years that every scientist on earth
[3:36:12.240 --> 3:36:20.240]  believed that man-made global warming was a fact if the people are able to
[3:36:20.240 --> 3:36:24.240]  block their carbon tax takeover the elites agenda to establish a planetary
[3:36:24.240 --> 3:36:29.240]  world government will collapse to force their unpopular agenda upon the
[3:36:29.240 --> 3:36:33.240]  planet the controllers are racing to complete the construction of their
[3:36:33.240 --> 3:36:38.240]  police state control grid borrowing from tactics used in the past by
[3:36:38.240 --> 3:36:43.240]  communist fascist and other totalitarian regimes every form of classical
[3:36:43.240 --> 3:36:50.240]  textbook tyranny is now being implemented in the west in the united states
[3:36:50.240 --> 3:36:56.240]  the central government is federalizing local police state and local officers
[3:36:56.240 --> 3:37:00.240]  are in a great position to collect important information on terrorists and
[3:37:00.240 --> 3:37:05.240]  their allies and a terrorist screening center stands ready to help you this
[3:37:05.240 --> 3:37:10.240]  video produced by homeland security is required viewing for all departments in
[3:37:10.240 --> 3:37:15.240]  the u.s. and with the teamwork of local state and federal law enforcement we
[3:37:15.240 --> 3:37:19.240]  have an excellent opportunity to see the picture and solve the puzzle before
[3:37:19.240 --> 3:37:25.240]  these terrorists can strike again state county and city police now take their
[3:37:25.240 --> 3:37:30.240]  marching orders directly from dhs and fema the videos and training manuals
[3:37:30.240 --> 3:37:35.240]  turn peace officers once guardians of the republic into secret police see way
[3:37:35.240 --> 3:37:42.240]  down there there's a woman taking photos of the dam someone called 911 and
[3:37:42.240 --> 3:37:46.240]  reported a suspicious person as you guessed she's going to be a category 3
[3:37:46.240 --> 3:37:51.240]  hit and since it's very important that we don't let her know that we know both
[3:37:51.240 --> 3:37:55.240]  the dispatcher and the officer need to make sure she doesn't hear the radio
[3:37:55.240 --> 3:38:00.240]  traffic stand by i could ask you to wait right here please
[3:38:02.240 --> 3:38:08.240]  everyday items and activities are listed as proof that you are sympathizing
[3:38:08.240 --> 3:38:13.240]  with shadowy boogeymen of terror of course he's going to keep his eyes open
[3:38:13.240 --> 3:38:17.240]  for anything interesting or unusual in the car that would include cameras
[3:38:17.240 --> 3:38:23.240]  binoculars video equipment gps maybe things like sleeping bags that suggest
[3:38:23.240 --> 3:38:27.240]  they're living out of the car from their inception homeland security in north

[3:39:17.240 --> 3:39:21.240]  hatred of the founding fathers and everything our constitutional republic
[3:39:21.240 --> 3:39:23.240]  stands for
[3:39:23.240 --> 3:39:28.240]  who was the first terrorist organization in the united states
[3:39:28.240 --> 3:39:29.240]  who?
[3:39:29.240 --> 3:39:31.240]  family bop
[3:39:31.240 --> 3:39:33.240]  you mean thomas jefferson?
[3:39:33.240 --> 3:39:34.240]  you mean uh...
[3:39:34.240 --> 3:39:36.240]  joint washington?
[3:39:36.240 --> 3:39:37.240]  what was there?
[3:39:37.240 --> 3:39:40.240]  these guys right here
[3:39:40.240 --> 3:39:43.240]  we asked you something, did they try to scare people?
[3:39:43.240 --> 3:39:45.240]  well yeah
[3:39:45.240 --> 3:39:49.240]  they tried to intimidate british, did they try to use acts of violence?
[3:39:49.240 --> 3:39:53.240]  your founding fathers, my founding fathers were involved in acts of
[3:39:53.240 --> 3:39:57.240]  terrorism against british officials because they systematically had british
[3:39:57.240 --> 3:40:00.240]  officials assassinate, assassinate
[3:40:00.240 --> 3:40:06.240]  in the old soviet union, nazi germany and malice china the police main job
[3:40:06.240 --> 3:40:10.240]  was not fighting crime into totalitarian forms of government
[3:40:10.240 --> 3:40:15.240]  the police are political enforcers or commissars as they were known in russia
[3:40:15.240 --> 3:40:20.240]  it's their job to spy on the public and to intimidate the exercise of free
[3:40:20.240 --> 3:40:25.240]  speech once a climate of fear has been achieved the public begins to
[3:40:25.240 --> 3:40:30.240]  self-censor to shut down once the people have been intimidated to
[3:40:30.240 --> 3:40:35.240]  withdraw from the field of intellectual battle the tyrants have a free hand to
[3:40:35.240 --> 3:40:41.240]  expand the repression and looting of the helpless serfs
[3:40:41.240 --> 3:40:45.240]  the average man and woman is in a trance
[3:40:45.240 --> 3:40:48.240]  they get home from work, they don't even talk to their children
[3:40:48.240 --> 3:40:50.240]  they turn the television on
[3:40:50.240 --> 3:40:55.240]  and they let those corporate messages set the agenda in their lives
[3:40:55.240 --> 3:40:59.240]  if we want a revolution against these social engineers
[3:40:59.240 --> 3:41:01.240]  and the scientific dictatorship
[3:41:01.240 --> 3:41:05.240]  we have to start getting back to basics having barbecues
[3:41:05.240 --> 3:41:09.240]  knowing our neighbors loving our husbands and wives
[3:41:09.240 --> 3:41:11.240]  spending time with our children
[3:41:11.240 --> 3:41:13.240]  and getting back to real human culture
[3:41:13.240 --> 3:41:19.240]  this false corporate culture has been superimposed over our daily lives
[3:41:19.240 --> 3:41:22.240]  the public is literally under a trance
[3:41:22.240 --> 3:41:27.240]  we have to somehow reach out to them and break them out of this trance
[3:41:27.240 --> 3:41:32.240]  and as the globalists destroy our standard of living and bring in their police state
[3:41:32.240 --> 3:41:35.240]  a lot of people are beginning to wake up
[3:41:35.240 --> 3:41:40.240]  and realize that what they've been told all their lives was a lie
[3:41:40.240 --> 3:41:45.240]  but it's essential that we the people are there to reach out to our fellow Americans
[3:41:45.240 --> 3:41:49.240]  and our fellow human beings and show them the truth
[3:41:49.240 --> 3:41:55.240]  but the scientific dictatorship needs more than just a secret police network to carry out their plan
[3:41:55.240 --> 3:42:00.240]  citizens spies at every level of society have been recruited
[3:42:00.240 --> 3:42:06.240]  to keep their eyes and ears focused on everything their neighbors and co-workers are doing and saying
[3:42:09.240 --> 3:42:13.240]  more than 50,000 private sector executives have been recruited by FEMA
[3:42:13.240 --> 3:42:19.240]  to secretly serve as deputy FBI informants under the InfraGuard program
[3:42:19.240 --> 3:42:26.240]  now there are more than 75,000 preachers serving FEMA in the clergy response teams
[3:42:26.240 --> 3:42:35.240]  internal FEMA documents reveal that the majority of America's pastors now serve as agents of the shadow government
[3:42:35.240 --> 3:42:39.240]  they are even instructed on how and what to preach
[3:42:39.240 --> 3:42:46.240]  and as KSLA News 12 Jeff Ferrell discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem
[3:42:46.240 --> 3:42:50.240]  us
[3:42:50.240 --> 3:42:55.240]  Charlton Heston's famous declaration captures a truly American value
[3:42:55.240 --> 3:42:58.240]  the overarching desire to protect our freedoms
[3:42:58.240 --> 3:43:02.240]  but gun confiscation is exactly what happened during the state of emergency
[3:43:02.240 --> 3:43:05.240]  following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans
[3:43:05.240 --> 3:43:07.240]  U.S. troops also arrived
[3:43:07.240 --> 3:43:11.240]  something far easier to do even now thanks to last year's elimination
[3:43:11.240 --> 3:43:14.240]  of the 1878 Posse-Cometotus Act
[3:43:14.240 --> 3:43:18.240]  that forbid U.S. troops from policing on American soil
[3:43:18.240 --> 3:43:22.240]  if martial law were enacted here at home
[3:43:22.240 --> 3:43:25.240]  public fears and quelling dissent would be critical
[3:43:25.240 --> 3:43:28.240]  and that's exactly what the clergy response team has its called
[3:43:28.240 --> 3:43:31.240]  help to accomplish in New Orleans
[3:43:31.240 --> 3:43:35.240]  Jeff, the primary thing that we say to anybody is let's cooperate and get this thing over with
[3:43:35.240 --> 3:43:38.240]  and then we'll settle the differences once the crisis is over
[3:43:38.240 --> 3:43:42.240]  such clergy response teams would walk a tightrope between the needs of the government
[3:43:42.240 --> 3:43:44.240]  versus the wishes of the public
[3:43:44.240 --> 3:43:48.240]  in a lot of cases these clergy would already be known in the neighborhoods
[3:43:48.240 --> 3:43:51.240]  in which they're helping to diffuse that situation
[3:43:51.240 --> 3:43:54.240]  for the clergy, one of the biggest tools that they will have
[3:43:54.240 --> 3:43:59.240]  in helping calm the public down or obey the law is the Bible itself
[3:43:59.240 --> 3:44:02.240]  specifically Romans, Romans 13
[3:44:02.240 --> 3:44:05.240]  because the government is established by the Lord
[3:44:05.240 --> 3:44:07.240]  and that's what we believe in the Christian faith
[3:44:07.240 --> 3:44:09.240]  that's what's stated in this Christian
[3:44:09.240 --> 3:44:14.240]  they're their flocks like sheep to the slaughter for gun confiscation
[3:44:14.240 --> 3:44:17.240]  forced inoculation
[3:44:17.240 --> 3:44:21.240]  and they tell them that it is a blessing to have their families broken up
[3:44:21.240 --> 3:44:24.240]  and put into FEMA camps
[3:44:32.240 --> 3:44:36.240]  Adolf Hitler bragged that his most powerful domestic tool
[3:44:36.240 --> 3:44:39.240]  used by the Nazis to control the people
[3:44:39.240 --> 3:44:41.240]  was the servile clergy
[3:44:41.240 --> 3:44:45.240]  and his favorite Bible verse was Romans 13
[3:44:45.240 --> 3:44:48.240]  render unto Caesar
[3:44:48.240 --> 3:44:50.240]  either you were with us
[3:44:50.240 --> 3:44:52.240]  or you were with the terrorists
[3:44:52.240 --> 3:44:56.240]  the scam was launched as a simple bait and switch
[3:44:56.240 --> 3:44:59.240]  the government recruited the public by telling them
[3:44:59.240 --> 3:45:02.240]  that they were needed in the fight against Al Qaeda
[3:45:02.240 --> 3:45:06.240]  from day one over 90% of their training and operations
[3:45:06.240 --> 3:45:10.240]  focus on demonizing, surveilling and harassing
[3:45:10.240 --> 3:45:13.240]  anyone who stands against their takeover
[3:45:13.240 --> 3:45:17.240]  the Department of Homeland Security calling on firefighters
[3:45:17.240 --> 3:45:20.240]  to take on a new role in the war on terror
[3:45:20.240 --> 3:45:24.240]  the idea to be the eyes for the US government when they're inside a home
[3:45:24.240 --> 3:45:26.240]  now unlike police officers
[3:45:26.240 --> 3:45:29.240]  firefighters don't need a warrant to go into private houses
[3:45:29.240 --> 3:45:32.240]  and critics say that's where things get sticking
[3:45:55.240 --> 3:45:58.240]  you can give information without having to give your name
[3:45:58.240 --> 3:46:01.240]  you guys can get paid for good tips
[3:46:01.240 --> 3:46:04.240]  up to $200
[3:46:04.240 --> 3:46:08.240]  the New York Times praised public school programs
[3:46:08.240 --> 3:46:10.240]  in the United States and England
[3:46:10.240 --> 3:46:14.240]  that are training children to report their parents for eco crimes
[3:46:14.240 --> 3:46:17.240]  like taking a hot bath
[3:46:17.240 --> 3:46:20.240]  or letting the water run while you brush your teeth
[3:46:20.240 --> 3:46:30.240]  all of that violates their carbon footprint credit allotment
[3:46:30.240 --> 3:46:32.240]  check it out, check it out
[3:46:32.240 --> 3:46:34.240]  that's where we come in
[3:46:34.240 --> 3:46:37.240]  where the carbon cops were on the lookout for energy waste
[3:46:37.240 --> 3:46:41.240]  our job is to get all Australian households to cut their carbon emissions
[3:46:41.240 --> 3:46:44.240]  so carbon cops is a program that looked at energy use in a domestic sense
[3:46:44.240 --> 3:46:46.240]  we went into people's houses
[3:46:46.240 --> 3:46:49.240]  and got them to reduce their energy use by 50%
[3:46:49.240 --> 3:46:53.240]  sadly, the Boy Scouts of America have now contracted
[3:46:53.240 --> 3:46:55.240]  with the Department of Homeland Security
[3:46:55.240 --> 3:46:58.240]  and are now training more than 20,000 Boy Scouts
[3:46:58.240 --> 3:47:01.240]  in anti-terror urban warfare mount training
[3:47:01.240 --> 3:47:04.240]  the federal grants are very specific
[3:47:04.240 --> 3:47:08.240]  the scouts are trained to carry out seek and destroy missions
[3:47:08.240 --> 3:47:12.240]  against disgruntled veterans of the US armed forces
[3:47:12.240 --> 3:47:14.240]  good evening everyone, Homeland Security is enlisting
[3:47:14.240 --> 3:47:17.240]  some unlikely new recruits to fight terrorism
[3:47:17.240 --> 3:47:19.240]  and help with other emergencies
[3:47:19.240 --> 3:47:21.240]  the Girl Scouts
[3:47:21.240 --> 3:47:24.240]  Girl Scouts across the country and here in East Tennessee are now taking part
[3:47:24.240 --> 3:47:28.240]  9 year old Elise Murphy has already earned a lot of Girl Scout patches
[3:47:28.240 --> 3:47:33.240]  and now, every member of the 3.4 million Girl Scouts of America
[3:47:33.240 --> 3:47:37.240]  is now being trained by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
[3:47:37.240 --> 3:47:40.240]  to aid and support Homeland Security
[3:47:40.240 --> 3:47:43.240]  in disaster and anti-terror operations
[3:47:43.240 --> 3:47:46.240]  one of the things that if you talk to our generals
[3:47:46.240 --> 3:47:48.240]  they are desperate for
[3:47:48.240 --> 3:47:53.240]  is a civilian counterpart to our military forces
[3:47:53.240 --> 3:47:56.240]  everybody somewhere between the ages of 18 and 25
[3:47:56.240 --> 3:47:58.240]  will serve 3 months of basic training and understanding
[3:47:58.240 --> 3:48:00.240]  in a kind of civil defense
[3:48:00.240 --> 3:48:02.240]  so is this compulsory then?
[3:48:02.240 --> 3:48:06.240]  well, you have to, in a sense, it's a requirement of everybody
[3:48:06.240 --> 3:48:09.240]  18 to 25, 3 months
[3:48:09.240 --> 3:48:12.240]  and at some point at that point you do it
[3:48:12.240 --> 3:48:15.240]  creating citizen armies in one way
[3:48:15.240 --> 3:48:17.240]  you know, it's disgusting
[3:48:17.240 --> 3:48:20.240]  because what you do is you get young kids
[3:48:20.240 --> 3:48:22.240]  and you can mold their minds easily
[3:48:22.240 --> 3:48:24.240]  and we saw them chanting and crying
[3:48:24.240 --> 3:48:26.240]  and they'll follow any leader
[3:48:26.240 --> 3:48:30.240]  whether it's in a black shirt, a brown shirt, a red shirt
[3:48:30.240 --> 3:48:32.240]  whatever the shirt might be
[3:48:32.240 --> 3:48:35.240]  another branch of Homeland Security
[3:48:35.240 --> 3:48:38.240]  the Corporation for National and Community Service
[3:48:38.240 --> 3:48:42.240]  is setting up literally hundreds of other private uniformed youth groups
[3:48:42.240 --> 3:48:45.240]  the White House has introduced legislation to establish
[3:48:45.240 --> 3:48:50.240]  forced national service for all Americans between the ages of 16 and 64
[3:48:50.240 --> 3:48:56.240]  in 2008, the North American military governorship known as Northcom
[3:48:56.240 --> 3:49:01.240]  announced that they had deployed 4,000 regular army troops inside the United States
[3:49:01.240 --> 3:49:03.240]  to deal with civil unrest
[3:49:03.240 --> 3:49:06.240]  because they knew that their offshore masters
[3:49:06.240 --> 3:49:08.240]  were about to rob the United States blind
[3:49:08.240 --> 3:49:12.240]  in 2009, the Pentagon requested funding from Congress
[3:49:12.240 --> 3:49:16.240]  to deploy 379,000 military personnel
[3:49:16.240 --> 3:49:19.240]  in thousands of communities across the United States
[3:49:19.240 --> 3:49:23.240]  and now, legislation has been introduced in Congress
[3:49:23.240 --> 3:49:28.240]  to expand a system of FEMA concentration camps across the United States
[3:49:28.240 --> 3:49:33.240]  under the National Emergency Centers Act, HR 645
[3:49:34.240 --> 3:49:37.240]  the Republic is hanging by a thread
[3:49:37.240 --> 3:49:42.240]  the last vestiges of our free system of government are being swept away
[3:49:43.240 --> 3:49:45.240]  you know, you got time to watch baseball
[3:49:45.240 --> 3:49:47.240]  you got time to watch football
[3:49:47.240 --> 3:49:49.240]  you got time to entertain yourself
[3:49:49.240 --> 3:49:53.240]  but I think a knowledgeable public we're losing
[3:49:53.240 --> 3:49:57.240]  and we've got to get people back on track to paying attention
[3:49:57.240 --> 3:50:00.240]  because if you don't take pay attention to your government
[3:50:00.240 --> 3:50:02.240]  and what they're doing
[3:50:02.240 --> 3:50:05.240]  you're going to pay some dire consequences for it
[3:50:05.240 --> 3:50:08.240]  unless we become active and become influential
[3:50:08.240 --> 3:50:11.240]  in the power centers of society
[3:50:11.240 --> 3:50:13.240]  there's nothing we can do about it
[3:50:13.240 --> 3:50:15.240]  just knowing about it is not enough
[3:50:15.240 --> 3:50:18.240]  and as long as we are given at election time an option
[3:50:18.240 --> 3:50:22.240]  between the Republican candidate or the Democrat candidate
[3:50:22.240 --> 3:50:26.240]  both of whom have been selected by members of the Council on Foreign Relations
[3:50:26.240 --> 3:50:29.240]  and both of whom have the same general policies
[3:50:29.240 --> 3:50:32.240]  that's not going to change anything either
[3:50:32.240 --> 3:50:35.240]  so the real issue is so what?
[3:50:35.240 --> 3:50:40.240]  and the answer is we've got to recapture control of the power centers of society
[3:50:40.240 --> 3:50:43.240]  the people have a decision to make
[3:50:43.240 --> 3:51:03.240]  our nation has been seized in the jaws of a global corporate takeover

[3:51:38.240 --> 3:51:41.240]  having it led back at interest forcing taxes to service debt
[3:51:41.240 --> 3:51:44.240]  this capitalism or was jeffison correct when stating a central bank
[3:51:44.240 --> 3:51:47.240]  issuing to public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people
[3:51:47.240 --> 3:51:48.240]  than a standing army
[3:51:48.240 --> 3:51:51.240]  hi, ted anderson, i'm placing a silver dollar in a book

[3:52:03.240 --> 3:52:07.240]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[3:52:07.240 --> 3:52:11.240]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[3:52:11.240 --> 3:52:13.240]  as we're finishing off this agenda
[3:52:13.240 --> 3:52:16.240]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the americans at home
[3:52:16.240 --> 3:52:20.240]  we have turned an innocent influence on our president in congress
[3:52:20.240 --> 3:52:22.240]  and they really are calling the shots
[3:52:22.240 --> 3:52:27.240]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[3:52:27.240 --> 3:52:30.240]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[3:52:30.240 --> 3:52:35.240]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[3:52:35.240 --> 3:52:38.240]  and on its ashes constructing world government
[3:52:38.240 --> 3:52:40.240]  tim geithner, bernanke, they're arsonists
[3:52:40.240 --> 3:52:42.240]  they're asking for more matches
[3:52:42.240 --> 3:52:44.240]  and the congress is saying who do we make the check out to?
[3:52:44.240 --> 3:52:46.240]  today seems like nobody does care
[3:52:46.240 --> 3:52:48.240]  and right now in washington dc
[3:52:48.240 --> 3:52:51.240]  we have seen a fall of the republic

[3:54:02.240 --> 3:54:04.240]  we're losing our freedoms
[3:54:04.240 --> 3:54:08.240]  and it's up to every man woman and child in the united states to decide
[3:54:08.240 --> 3:54:13.240]  whether we're going to be fooled by the slick propaganda of the social engineers
[3:54:13.240 --> 3:54:16.240]  or whether we're going to restore the republic
[3:54:16.240 --> 3:54:20.240]  the values expressed by our founding fathers and the Declaration of Independence
[3:54:20.240 --> 3:54:23.240]  and other documents are very important to these times
[3:54:23.240 --> 3:54:30.240]  and it's now our chance to manifest those documents
[3:54:30.240 --> 3:54:34.240]  now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country
[3:54:34.240 --> 3:54:38.240]  because the country is being stolen from us in broad daylight
[3:54:38.240 --> 3:54:42.240]  not only stolen metaphorically but financially as well
[3:54:42.240 --> 3:54:44.240]  the numbers don't lie
[3:54:44.240 --> 3:54:50.240]  the American people having been educated as to the truth
[3:54:50.240 --> 3:54:59.240]  then have to rise up and demand and get a government that starts serving them
[3:54:59.240 --> 3:55:05.240]  we need a change and it isn't going to come from democrats and republicans
[3:55:05.240 --> 3:55:08.240]  it has to come from the American people
[3:55:08.240 --> 3:55:11.240]  dissension is the greatest form of patriotism
[3:55:11.240 --> 3:55:13.240]  and I believe that
[3:55:13.240 --> 3:55:17.240]  because if you don't hold your elected officials feet to the fire
[3:55:17.240 --> 3:55:20.240]  and pay attention you are going to get bad government
[3:55:20.240 --> 3:55:22.240]  so it's imperative for all of us
[3:55:22.240 --> 3:55:27.240]  it's our job as citizens of this great country to pay attention
[3:55:27.240 --> 3:55:31.240]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[3:55:31.240 --> 3:55:36.240]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[3:55:36.240 --> 3:55:41.240]  America is a prize coveted by the despotic mega corporations
[3:55:41.240 --> 3:55:43.240]  that now dominate our planet
[3:55:43.240 --> 3:55:46.240]  if their world government is truly to rise
[3:55:46.240 --> 3:55:50.240]  it's the kingdom and the republic for which it stands must fall
[3:55:50.240 --> 3:55:56.240]  now is the time for all good men and women to come to the aid of their country
[3:55:56.240 --> 3:56:02.240]  one of the greatest events in history is taking place before our very eyes
[3:56:02.240 --> 3:56:04.240]  for many generations into the future
[3:56:04.240 --> 3:56:07.240]  our progeny will look back on this time
[3:56:07.240 --> 3:56:10.240]  as either replace where humanity rose to the challenge
[3:56:10.240 --> 3:56:13.240]  and made a stand against the forces of darkness
[3:56:13.240 --> 3:56:18.240]  this is the time when the planet fell into the grip of a merciless high-tech tyranny
[3:56:26.240 --> 3:56:29.240]  in part two, a fall of the republic
[3:56:29.240 --> 3:56:32.240]  you will learn the elites master plan for humanity
[3:56:32.240 --> 3:56:34.240]  but more importantly
[3:56:34.240 --> 3:56:37.240]  you will learn how to stop that plan
[3:56:37.240 --> 3:56:39.240]  reverse the criminal tide
[3:56:39.240 --> 3:56:42.240]  and reignite the flame of liberty
[3:56:42.240 --> 3:56:46.240]  long march to man's ultimate destiny
