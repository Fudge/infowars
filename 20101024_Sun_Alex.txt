[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.320]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.320 --> 00:27.240]  Texas Alex Jones welcome ladies and gentlemen it is Friday the 8th day of
[00:27.240 --> 00:32.280]  October 2010 coming up in 30 minutes we have the husband and wife joining us
[00:32.280 --> 00:37.600]  from New Hampshire who are oathkeepers I actually have the CPS report they cite
[00:37.600 --> 00:41.760]  the fact that he's an oathkeeper part of a quote militia is the main reason that
[00:41.760 --> 00:47.060]  they took the child and we're gonna get Ron Paul's take on that Congressman Ron
[00:47.060 --> 00:51.000]  Paul joins us for the next 30 minutes we really appreciate him joining us in
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.280]  his busy schedule and we're gonna talk about the economy the situation with
[00:56.280 --> 01:00.240]  Iran of course so what he talked about a decade ago is now unfolding the
[01:00.240 --> 01:05.400]  financial collapse Congressman Ron Paul thank you for joining us today good to
[01:05.400 --> 01:10.600]  be with you thank you so much is happening but I saw a report yesterday
[01:10.600 --> 01:17.360]  put out by CNBC also zero hedge that the Federal Reserve is now the second
[01:17.360 --> 01:23.720]  largest holder of US Treasury bonds they own 821.1 billion so not just the
[01:23.720 --> 01:28.360]  communist Chinese are are you know basically controlling this country but
[01:28.360 --> 01:33.320]  now the private fellow reserve yeah and obviously they had to do that or
[01:33.320 --> 01:37.920]  interest rates would have popped up you know in some ways if you're looking at
[01:37.920 --> 01:43.400]  for some benefits from that just think when we have true reform there's no
[01:43.400 --> 01:48.440]  reason for the Treasury to pay these bills to the Fed you know in an effort
[01:48.440 --> 01:53.120]  to go through a transition it'd be nice if we could honor you know the Treasury
[01:53.120 --> 01:57.720]  bills held by private individuals who you know naively bought our government
[01:57.720 --> 02:02.080]  debt but we do not have to pay that when we have our reform we just throw that
[02:02.080 --> 02:05.600]  out because they're holding the debt and we had a new system it wouldn't be
[02:05.600 --> 02:10.040]  necessary. There was a headline in Market Watch of the Wall Street Journal
[02:10.040 --> 02:13.400]  yesterday with one of their analysts saying that they believe it'll be the
[02:13.400 --> 02:18.680]  end of the Federal Reserve by 2012 more and more even mainstream media is
[02:18.680 --> 02:23.920]  sounding like Congressman Ron Paul. Yeah I'm amazed at the progress we've made
[02:23.920 --> 02:28.680]  with stations like yours and many others and our Internet who have joined us
[02:28.680 --> 02:33.240]  I'm sure you can remember three years ago this was a non-event you know talk
[02:33.240 --> 02:37.640]  about the Fed we were still considered you know way outside cooks that even
[02:37.640 --> 02:41.760]  bring the subject up but it is frequently discussed on the business
[02:41.760 --> 02:45.160]  channels at least not the political channels as much as the business
[02:45.160 --> 02:49.880]  channels they're starting to realize that you know the Fed is responsible so
[02:49.880 --> 02:55.440]  I keep harping at it that if you want full employment that's why I always keep
[02:55.440 --> 02:59.240]  the door open for the left because they always preach we care about the poor and
[02:59.240 --> 03:04.080]  we care about jobs what they do they have to look at monetary policy and just
[03:04.080 --> 03:08.400]  look how this system destroys the middle class the first people to lose their
[03:08.400 --> 03:12.360]  jobs are the people who were supposed to be helped by the Barney Franks of the
[03:12.360 --> 03:17.160]  world and here they they end up losing their houses losing their jobs and who
[03:17.160 --> 03:20.760]  gets bailed out you know the big mortgage companies the big gamblers the
[03:20.760 --> 03:24.480]  ones who made billions of dollars when the bubble was being inflated and now
[03:24.480 --> 03:28.120]  they're still making money but I think the people are waking up I think they're
[03:28.120 --> 03:31.880]  much aware of what's happening the Fed is not going to get off the hook no
[03:31.880 --> 03:36.880]  matter what they do they cannot escape the blame well we've got this outside
[03:36.880 --> 03:41.680]  branch of government that's private that you've tried to audit and now they
[03:41.680 --> 03:45.880]  positioned us to where they're the second biggest owner of our debt along with
[03:45.880 --> 03:49.480]  communist China I don't know which one is worse I mean we're clearly being
[03:49.480 --> 03:53.520]  conquered economically through this fraud but because it is a fraud if we
[03:53.520 --> 03:57.320]  just stand up and say no to it as you said we have no responsibility to pay
[03:57.320 --> 04:02.880]  this money yeah and the time will come I mean the default is on its way and
[04:02.880 --> 04:08.120]  Bernanke actually is very sympathetic to inflation and he also understands that
[04:08.120 --> 04:11.960]  printing money causes price inflation and when you have the price inflation
[04:11.960 --> 04:17.120]  devaluing the currency this literally reduces your real debt so if he can if
[04:17.120 --> 04:21.880]  he can double prices and double it with double in the money supply you know the
[04:21.880 --> 04:26.240]  debt goes down by 50% gosh disappointed that the prices aren't going up fast
[04:26.240 --> 04:31.280]  enough so the devaluation is it's bad it's horrible but even once more of it
[04:31.280 --> 04:36.240]  amazing stay there congressman when we come back I want you as an economic
[04:36.240 --> 04:39.680]  expert in this area and who've obviously been part of the testimony and
[04:39.680 --> 04:44.000]  hearing so many times researching this to break down what devaluation of the
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.800]  currency means the Federal Reserve was on the news as you know yesterday saying
[04:48.800 --> 04:54.040]  yes we want inflation to fix the debt so explain to people what that means and
[04:54.040 --> 04:59.960]  solutions out of this crisis on the other side with Dr. Ron Paul
[04:59.960 --> 05:04.160]  you may be arrested and or subject to other police action
[05:04.160 --> 05:09.880]  tyranny is here the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality it really
[05:09.880 --> 05:14.600]  says that the state is God the United States has now recognized globally as
[05:14.600 --> 05:18.920]  one of the most oppressive police states on earth this film conclusively

[05:27.600 --> 05:31.800]  has established an old powerful shadow state police state for chronicles the

[06:02.880 --> 06:12.880]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network back in
[06:12.880 --> 06:16.160]  1999 when they got rid of the Glass-Steagall act and allowed the
[06:16.160 --> 06:21.400]  private mega banks to start issuing even more counterfeit financial instruments
[06:21.400 --> 06:27.240]  Ron Paul said this will cause this country to collapse this will over extend the
[06:27.240 --> 06:32.280]  empire and remember him even putting the number on it you know that that he
[06:32.280 --> 06:36.720]  would say clearly in the next 10 to 15 years well here we are 11 years later
[06:36.720 --> 06:43.040]  and it's not prophecy it's just good economics strong free market understanding
[06:43.040 --> 06:47.840]  of what's happening and the congressman joins us in the short segment we were
[06:47.840 --> 06:52.400]  getting into the situation of the private Federal Reserve being the second
[06:52.400 --> 06:57.840]  biggest holder of U.S. Treasuries over 821 billion close second to
[06:57.840 --> 07:02.280]  communist China and the congressman has been talking about the collapse that
[07:02.280 --> 07:05.920]  we're going into and we have all the economic numbers there we never left
[07:05.920 --> 07:10.480]  the recession and by most yardsticks we're in a depression so can you give
[07:10.480 --> 07:14.840]  us a forecast from your deep research and the word you're getting up there on
[07:14.840 --> 07:20.440]  the banking committee about where we are congressman Ron Paul and the Fed's
[07:20.440 --> 07:25.560]  signals to accelerate the monetization of debt clearly driving the dollar down
[07:25.560 --> 07:31.320]  and gold up right and although we can be optimistic about what's changing in the
[07:31.320 --> 07:34.960]  country a lot of attitudes are improving there's a better understanding of free
[07:34.960 --> 07:39.480]  market economics and Austrian economics and the importance of gold and and how
[07:39.480 --> 07:44.800]  significant the Fed is in Washington no attitudes have changed Bernanke and other
[07:44.800 --> 07:49.320]  Geithner these guys will just they have their wall and their backup against the
[07:49.320 --> 07:54.320]  wall so instead of saying hey maybe I was wrong which they're incapable
[07:54.320 --> 07:59.080]  psychologically to do because that means they've invested 30 or 40 years in
[07:59.080 --> 08:03.840]  promoting this nonsense they they can't admit that so the worst things get the
[08:03.840 --> 08:09.440]  more they continue to do bad policy that is spend borrow and play and and
[08:09.440 --> 08:13.920]  regulate they think regulations can compensate for the market regulating and
[08:13.920 --> 08:18.720]  therefore they can make you know they can do this economic planning through
[08:18.720 --> 08:23.320]  monetary policy so nothing nothing has changed there so what that does it
[08:23.320 --> 08:28.040]  guarantees the prolongation of the problems that we have you have to have
[08:28.040 --> 08:32.760]  the liquidation of debt and they will not permit the liquidation of debt they
[08:32.760 --> 08:36.720]  just transfer the debt from their privileged friends over onto the
[08:36.720 --> 08:41.160]  taxpayers so if you look at all the mortgage debt and the derivatives that's
[08:41.160 --> 08:44.840]  what we bought it's horrible that they have eight hundred and some billion
[08:44.840 --> 08:49.440]  dollars of Treasury bills but they they have over a trillion dollars of all
[08:49.440 --> 08:53.920]  this other bad debt which is probably worthless should have been sold on the
[08:53.920 --> 08:57.800]  market for what the market would pay for it but they bought it for these banks
[08:57.800 --> 09:02.240]  at the nominal rate it's criminal and it's just going to lead us to runaway
[09:02.240 --> 09:08.040]  inflation all that's by government when it gets out of hand the debt gets
[09:08.040 --> 09:13.280]  liquidated it doesn't get liquidated by them for refusing to pay the debt it's
[09:13.280 --> 09:17.760]  liquidated by passing out money that's cheap and that's what the evaluation is
[09:17.760 --> 09:22.320]  all about their devaluing the currency on purpose sticking it to the person who
[09:22.320 --> 09:27.680]  might want to save or who has to live you know close on the margin they get to
[09:27.680 --> 09:32.880]  higher prices they lose their jobs they they lose their savings and Austrian
[09:32.880 --> 09:38.160]  economics and Mies has pointed this out that when you destroy a currency
[09:38.160 --> 09:42.960]  you destroy the middle class and that's what we're witnessing right now that's
[09:42.960 --> 09:47.240]  right all the economic indicators are that the middle class is evaporating
[09:47.240 --> 09:53.160]  before our eyes here's the Wall Street Journal yesterday Fed officials mull
[09:53.160 --> 10:01.000]  inflation as a fix so they've always denied that they were using inflation to
[10:01.000 --> 10:05.320]  basically cover up the massive debts now they've gotten so desperate they're
[10:05.320 --> 10:09.800]  shifting gears and Bernanke saying okay we are in deep trouble we are in a
[10:09.800 --> 10:16.240]  crisis but I've got the solution we're going to further devalue the dollar but
[10:16.240 --> 10:20.720]  the answer is according to his statements in the G20 statement is this
[10:20.720 --> 10:26.120]  coordinated lowering of currencies but but they claim that that would stop any
[10:26.120 --> 10:30.120]  type of currency war but as you know congressman the currency war is now on
[10:30.120 --> 10:34.800]  and so just as we saw Weimar Republic Germany or Zimbabwe in the last few
[10:34.800 --> 10:40.080]  years in of course Africa or a decade ago in Argentina once you get to a
[10:40.080 --> 10:46.200]  tipping point a flash point the devaluation accelerates are we nearing
[10:46.200 --> 10:51.720]  a flash implosion point or will it just be a continual devaluation well
[10:51.720 --> 10:56.640]  there we eventually will be a crash of the of the dollar but the whole policy
[10:56.640 --> 11:00.480]  makes no sense just like we we got in a trouble by spending and borrowing and
[11:00.480 --> 11:05.280]  inflating so we do more of it but the whole idea that it's good for the
[11:05.280 --> 11:09.680]  people to depreciate their money devalue the money that means if you have a
[11:09.680 --> 11:14.720]  hundred dollars in the bank tomorrow the next week if they were 95 or 90 it's a
[11:14.720 --> 11:20.720]  criminal theft is what it what it is but that's what they call good policy and
[11:20.720 --> 11:26.040]  all the countries of the world are doing this and it does go down gradually and
[11:26.040 --> 11:32.400]  it doesn't it doesn't go down you know you can't calculate it if if the Fed
[11:32.400 --> 11:38.040]  increases the money by 10% every year that doesn't mean prices go up 10% you
[11:38.040 --> 11:42.960]  know every year what happens is you know there's productivity that keeps prices
[11:42.960 --> 11:47.480]  down there's the psychological factor there's trust in the dollars trust in
[11:47.480 --> 11:53.080]  the politicians so you might have a steady erosion of the key currency which
[11:53.080 --> 11:58.280]  is the dollar which has happened since brand woods it's down about 35% against
[11:58.280 --> 12:03.240]  all other currencies so it's hard to measure the destruction of the dollar
[12:03.240 --> 12:08.680]  just against currencies because all the other currencies are not much better the
[12:08.680 --> 12:13.400]  only thing the only true test over the centuries has been the devaluation
[12:13.400 --> 12:17.400]  against gold and gold measures value better than anything else and who wants
[12:17.400 --> 12:22.080]  the value of their gold to go down and in the purchasing power is always going
[12:22.080 --> 12:27.920]  up with the fiat money but here we are have the world competing to find out
[12:27.920 --> 12:32.520]  how fast they can devalue their currencies it's absolutely insane and
[12:32.520 --> 12:38.200]  it's very destructive in the final stages indeed are rapid even though
[12:38.200 --> 12:43.360]  they're erratic as they inflate there's final but there's finally a point in
[12:43.360 --> 12:47.440]  monetary destruction where everybody throws in the towel then they rush out
[12:47.440 --> 12:52.240]  of it and everybody's working hard to prevent the panic and they'll even
[12:52.240 --> 12:56.480]  interfere and get into markets to fight the price of gold to prevent the
[12:56.480 --> 13:02.040]  panic but when the time comes you know if it looks like it's going to zero or
[13:02.040 --> 13:05.560]  lose a lot you know the Chinese will dump it everybody else will dump it
[13:05.560 --> 13:08.760]  interest rates are going to go up inflation rates are going to go up the
[13:08.760 --> 13:13.480]  economy is going to get weaker and then we as a country will be forced to have
[13:13.480 --> 13:17.800]  monetary reform and we get in the only way you can have true monetary reform is
[13:17.800 --> 13:22.240]  you have to monitor that you have to change the role of government we cannot
[13:22.240 --> 13:26.280]  continue to be the policeman of the world and run a welfare stay and think
[13:26.280 --> 13:30.240]  that changing the monetary system will help so you have to revamp the whole
[13:30.240 --> 13:33.520]  idea about the what our government should be doing what the role of government
[13:33.520 --> 13:37.640]  is the proper rule of government under the law is very limited according to our
[13:37.640 --> 13:42.800]  constitution and the monetary issue has been well defined in the constitution
[13:42.800 --> 13:47.720]  so the answers are there and one of these days soon it could be it could be in a
[13:47.720 --> 13:52.280]  year it could be in three or four five years but it will come but the gradual
[13:52.280 --> 13:57.840]  erosion of the purchasing power of the dollar will continue congressman looking
[13:57.840 --> 14:05.120]  at the death of the Anglo-American Empire geopolitically and economically you
[14:05.120 --> 14:11.320]  know and and as a doctor with the analogy I mean are we a year two years
[14:11.320 --> 14:16.000]  three years from the implosion of the Empire and then what comes out of that
[14:16.000 --> 14:21.000]  implosion of the Empire I mean where is the United States going from here but
[14:21.000 --> 14:25.920]  there's no way anybody knows the precise time but you can be certain if certain
[14:25.920 --> 14:29.120]  events are occurring like the depreciation of money and the
[14:29.120 --> 14:34.480]  continuing plating of the currency it will come but I'm sure we're getting
[14:34.480 --> 14:40.960]  much closer and it could be within you knew a few years now when this happens
[14:40.960 --> 14:45.960]  you can have two of things the status quo will not be maintained because all
[14:45.960 --> 14:50.120]  wealth is being shifted right now like we said it's being shifted away from the
[14:50.120 --> 14:53.280]  middle class and the wealthy and the Wall Streeters and the bankers have all
[14:53.280 --> 14:59.160]  the wealth and they'll probably have a lot of the gold as well so we shift
[14:59.160 --> 15:02.920]  toward going back to our roots and deciding the founders are on the right
[15:02.920 --> 15:08.080]  track and we reinstate those views or we do something what I like what happened
[15:08.080 --> 15:14.880]  to Germany in the 20s it ushered in a militant evil dictator which was Hitler
[15:14.880 --> 15:20.640]  who scapegoated a group of people that they blamed everything on the Jews and
[15:20.640 --> 15:24.640]  the hatred was built and today we have our scapegoats around you know that's
[15:24.640 --> 15:28.600]  hate this group that's hate that group blame them for the whole problem so
[15:28.600 --> 15:33.580]  people are right for that but in spite of that great danger I still think we're
[15:33.580 --> 15:38.040]  making progress I think we're really competing very well with those who are
[15:38.040 --> 15:42.840]  demanding a dictator I haven't heard many people at our tea party groups
[15:42.840 --> 15:47.640]  meetings that are demanding ah things are so tough what we need now is a
[15:47.640 --> 15:51.720]  dictator what they want is less government and more power returned to
[15:51.720 --> 15:53.920]  the people
[16:00.320 --> 16:04.520]  you've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs generator infuses the
[16:04.520 --> 16:08.480]  respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions yet
[16:08.480 --> 16:11.880]  many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs system and how it has
[16:11.880 --> 16:16.720]  been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body my

[19:57.800 --> 20:00.520]  sampler thank you
[20:00.520 --> 20:06.520]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[20:06.520 --> 20:23.280]  Broadcasting Network. Network they're building all this anger towards the
[20:23.280 --> 20:30.960]  free market they're calling this inside crony capitalism capitalism to
[20:30.960 --> 20:35.920]  demonize the free market and as things implode the collectivists are going to
[20:35.920 --> 20:40.080]  try to sell the giant horde of poor people on looting what's left for the
[20:40.080 --> 20:44.320]  middle class in the name of socketed to the rich guy and they have to also
[20:44.320 --> 20:49.920]  remember that in fascism the title of companies in the land doesn't go over to
[20:49.920 --> 20:54.240]  the government and it just is the controls so the controls are there I
[20:54.240 --> 20:57.720]  mean what can you do in business these days without asking permission from a
[20:57.720 --> 21:03.520]  32 different agencies of government and what and the use of your land I mean
[21:03.520 --> 21:09.240]  the taxation and the use of your land is so harness that we really have lost it
[21:09.240 --> 21:13.240]  yet we still have a title and responsibilities for it in order to
[21:13.240 --> 21:18.360]  generate the tax revenues that they want so that is separating that out too
[21:18.360 --> 21:22.240]  often you know the left will complain about a lot of things we're complaining
[21:22.240 --> 21:27.520]  about but whether they're confused on economics or whether they do it on
[21:27.520 --> 21:32.560]  purpose you know they maybe they are you know really promoting socialism so they
[21:32.560 --> 21:37.600]  will like the idea of bashing corporations but at the same time we have
[21:37.600 --> 21:42.040]  to separate the two the corporations that are honest live in versus the one
[21:42.040 --> 21:46.200]  that live off the people well we know the big mega fortune 100 almost to a
[21:46.200 --> 21:50.640]  company our pro-globalist pro-collectivism to collectivize our wealth and
[21:50.640 --> 21:56.240]  transfer it offshore they are the engineers of of socialism of all of
[21:56.240 --> 22:00.040]  this you know New World Order garbage that we're seeing we've only got about
[22:00.040 --> 22:03.240]  eight minutes left with the congressman I want to move quickly sir and we're
[22:03.240 --> 22:07.400]  very appreciative for you joining us in all the great work that you're doing in
[22:07.400 --> 22:12.760]  Washington we also see the system coming in against free speech trying to
[22:12.760 --> 22:18.840]  regulate tax the internet ordering ISPs outside of law saw the headline last
[22:18.840 --> 22:24.640]  week where Obama said well he wants ISPs voluntarily to shut down websites if
[22:24.640 --> 22:28.400]  the government asked just outside of courts they're openly admitting we need
[22:28.400 --> 22:33.000]  a kill switch to turn the web off to keep you safe the system is really
[22:33.000 --> 22:37.240]  getting scared of the internet because of the alternative media can you speak
[22:37.240 --> 22:42.080]  to that well I've been fighting that for a long time because I think that has
[22:42.080 --> 22:47.240]  been such a blessing to us to have have the internet but it becomes
[22:47.240 --> 22:50.840]  politically difficult for me and you probably have been aware of some of my
[22:50.840 --> 22:55.680]  vote sometimes I'm by myself because sometimes they'll say oh we have to do
[22:55.680 --> 22:59.960]  this because this is a bad guy he's involved in in drugs and this is a bad
[22:59.960 --> 23:04.720]  guy he could be a terrorist he's a bad guy because he does pornography and on
[23:04.720 --> 23:09.160]  and on I mean they picked the most vicious looking people that have made
[23:09.160 --> 23:13.480]  use of the internet therefore you say oh well we're gonna regulate them not
[23:13.480 --> 23:19.120]  realizing that if you can preempt anybody that might be on the internet
[23:19.120 --> 23:22.760]  because it might be a bad person that means they can preempt us it's a it's a
[23:22.760 --> 23:28.520]  prior restraint on our right to speech and that is very very dangerous and
[23:28.520 --> 23:34.160]  of course most people realize the First Amendment isn't there to protect talking
[23:34.160 --> 23:38.560]  about the weather you know in benign speech it's there to protect us against
[23:38.560 --> 23:43.320]  a very controversial political speech but if it moves in this direction
[23:43.320 --> 23:47.080]  continues to move this way then we are gonna lose our right of political
[23:47.080 --> 23:54.680]  speech on the internet congressman dealing with the election coming up we
[23:54.680 --> 23:59.560]  know it's a major political awakening a realignment kind of mainline neocons have
[23:59.560 --> 24:04.160]  come in and tried to dominate many of the races but we see establishment
[24:04.160 --> 24:08.360]  republicans losing in the primaries establishment style democrats losing in
[24:08.360 --> 24:13.480]  the primaries harry reid now in desperate trouble rand 11 to 15 points
[24:13.480 --> 24:17.640]  ahead depending on which poll you see but but that doesn't mean he's gonna win
[24:17.640 --> 24:22.000]  we still need to get behind him and support him what can you say about your
[24:22.000 --> 24:25.920]  son's run in Kentucky and how important that is and the overall political
[24:25.920 --> 24:31.200]  realignment happening what do you see coming up in the election next month
[24:31.200 --> 24:34.840]  probably won't be as good as we hope but it's gonna be good there's gonna be
[24:34.840 --> 24:39.160]  improvement and most everybody is predicting that ran will win but I've
[24:39.160 --> 24:43.640]  urged him not to slow up I mean you got to assume that you have to fight for the
[24:43.640 --> 24:48.920]  last vote but you know there will be a change it will be a message but you
[24:48.920 --> 24:53.120]  know we probably won't get this in it and the Republican still have to prove
[24:53.120 --> 24:56.080]  themselves that they've learned a lesson and if they do pass the good
[24:56.080 --> 25:01.720]  legislation and resist then we they face veto so there's not gonna be a
[25:01.720 --> 25:06.560]  dramatic change there may be a significant improvement in in just
[25:06.560 --> 25:11.240]  confidence in the system in that maybe we can slow Obama up which would be
[25:11.240 --> 25:16.000]  pretty good just thinking if we'd have had a strong Republican Congress house
[25:16.000 --> 25:20.160]  he just even a house maybe Obamacare wouldn't have been passed maybe we
[25:20.160 --> 25:23.080]  would have been able to prevent some of these things and and since you bring
[25:23.080 --> 25:28.160]  that up just two final quick questions did you see the USA Today article where
[25:28.160 --> 25:33.840]  McDonald's and 29 other firms have been given a federal government exemption
[25:33.840 --> 25:39.200]  they don't have to buy health care but 29 million plus other small businesses do
[25:39.200 --> 25:45.960]  is that not incredible discrimination and and and literal divide and conquer
[25:45.960 --> 25:49.480]  where of you you know or a big corporation you don't have to follow
[25:49.480 --> 25:53.080]  the same rules as the people yeah it doesn't sound like equal protection under
[25:53.080 --> 25:56.520]  the law you know and if you were the Constitution is very clear if you are
[25:56.520 --> 26:01.720]  going to have a law write a law for any of the legitimate function of the
[26:01.720 --> 26:06.000]  federal government it has to be uniform and here what have they done here they
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.800]  have not made it uniform they shouldn't have made the law in the first place it
[26:08.800 --> 26:12.520]  was illegal so then now whether they're implementing it it's not even legal
[26:12.520 --> 26:17.600]  either because it's not uniform so and that means that those numbers of people
[26:17.600 --> 26:21.240]  say okay I don't have to worry they took me out of it but just think you know
[26:21.240 --> 26:27.680]  maybe maybe the insiders think hey you know we have everybody you know working
[26:27.680 --> 26:31.520]  up McDonald's another place and then they're losing their jobs or they the
[26:31.520 --> 26:36.240]  their salary or you know salaries go down or something like that then they
[26:36.240 --> 26:40.800]  might have you know exerted a lot of pressure so no equal justice of the law
[26:40.800 --> 26:43.920]  that principle should apply and they shouldn't be allowed to do that well it
[26:43.920 --> 26:49.160]  just shows how every basic canon of our republic of our bill of rights and
[26:49.160 --> 26:53.080]  Constitution is just being completely flush final question we've got about a
[26:53.080 --> 26:57.160]  minute and a half on this you've got some time I'm sure you've seen the
[26:57.160 --> 27:01.400]  Robert Shapiro quotes about what Obama needs as a major Oklahoma City or 911
[27:01.400 --> 27:05.640]  attack so he can appear strong Governor Ridge last year the former head of
[27:05.640 --> 27:10.120]  Homeland Security admitted that in 2004 for the election the Bush people ordered
[27:10.120 --> 27:14.800]  him to put out fake terror alerts which is literally yelling fire in a theater
[27:14.800 --> 27:19.520]  for political gain now we see all these new terror alerts with specific targets
[27:19.520 --> 27:24.600]  right before the election does that smack of an October surprise I mean even
[27:24.600 --> 27:28.800]  if attacks don't take place just the act of saying the terrorists are gonna
[27:28.800 --> 27:32.320]  get you and new bin Laden tapes I mean does that look suspicious to you
[27:32.320 --> 27:38.000]  congressman well I think it's just routine I think that state is always
[27:38.000 --> 27:42.720]  want to you know generate fear in the people whether it's economic fear or
[27:42.720 --> 27:48.440]  fear of somebody invading and want to attack because then if you don't go
[27:48.440 --> 27:51.240]  along with what the government tells you then they can paint you as being
[27:51.240 --> 27:55.920]  unpatriotic and un-American so in order for them to survive and them means
[27:55.920 --> 28:01.040]  those people who like big government and state ism and world empires they have
[28:01.040 --> 28:06.480]  to have support from the people and the people will tend to give the support if
[28:06.480 --> 28:11.920]  they get frightened enough you know like after 9-11 they were quite willing you
[28:11.920 --> 28:16.440]  know your statement well I know I had to give up my freedom but I'd rather be
[28:16.440 --> 28:20.400]  and I'd rather them do that than be killed you know and they were willing
[28:20.400 --> 28:26.000]  to sacrifice their freedoms so fear the fear is the tool of the thugs in government
[28:26.000 --> 28:30.800]  the authoritarian they need to you know beat the drops and then there's once
[28:30.800 --> 28:35.120]  again it's this thing and crying wolf I mean who believes this stuff anymore
[28:35.120 --> 28:38.160]  that they're about to attack well we don't know who it's gonna be or where it's
[28:38.160 --> 28:42.080]  gonna be if we did with arrest them so they don't know very much so when the
[28:42.080 --> 28:46.080]  real one comes even if they had good information which generally they don't
[28:46.080 --> 28:50.880]  I mean they weren't very good absolutely congressman thank you for spending time

[32:16.040 --> 32:20.400]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[32:20.400 --> 32:24.760]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[32:24.760 --> 32:28.480]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[32:28.480 --> 32:32.640]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[32:32.640 --> 32:36.360]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[32:36.360 --> 32:40.420]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[32:40.420 --> 32:43.120]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[32:43.120 --> 32:46.640]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[32:46.640 --> 32:52.200]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government

[33:00.440 --> 33:06.520]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[33:06.520 --> 33:19.280]  Broadcasting Network now ladies and gentlemen we have the one the only
[33:19.280 --> 33:24.400]  Lou Dobbs joining us and we're very honored to have Lou on he really doesn't
[33:24.400 --> 33:30.280]  need any introduction but he's a best-selling author researcher syndicated
[33:30.280 --> 33:36.240]  radio host number one show for a long while on CNN until he was basically
[33:36.240 --> 33:40.360]  shown the door because he wouldn't compromise on Barry Sitaro and the open
[33:40.360 --> 33:44.780]  borders Lou Dobbs great to have you on sir you're with the Alex thank you so
[33:44.780 --> 33:50.200]  much you know there's so much to talk about but but out of the gates what's
[33:50.200 --> 33:54.560]  most important to Lou Dobbs on your radar sir right now the most important
[33:54.560 --> 33:59.400]  thing is restoring a fundamental the fundamental tenets of a democratic
[33:59.400 --> 34:04.200]  constitutional republic and finally representation for the American people in
[34:04.200 --> 34:10.480]  Washington DC mr. Dobbs what do you think about all the news reports now that
[34:10.480 --> 34:14.880]  90 plus percent and the Poletano admits this of Homeland Security is pointed at
[34:14.880 --> 34:19.200]  libertarians conservatives returning veterans gun owners Ron Paul Chuck
[34:19.200 --> 34:24.080]  Baldwin Bob Barr what's your take on the fact that Homeland Security has been
[34:24.080 --> 34:30.680]  basically set up for the American people well I think the idea that this
[34:30.680 --> 34:36.120]  administration has politicized not only the Homeland Security Department but
[34:36.120 --> 34:41.600]  also the Justice Department has created an enemy's list that is being
[34:41.600 --> 34:47.920]  prosecuted by the White House I think Alex is shameful and what is I think is
[34:47.920 --> 34:52.400]  almost as shameful as the fact that the Fourth of State has become something of
[34:52.400 --> 35:00.400]  a fifth column in this country working as to aid to a bet the left-wing
[35:00.400 --> 35:04.360]  agenda of this administration and the democratic leadership of Congress I
[35:04.360 --> 35:11.800]  think it's a shame it's an outrage I am the national left-wing liberal what you
[35:11.800 --> 35:17.960]  color what you want to mainstream media is simply observing rather than applying
[35:17.960 --> 35:23.040]  critical judgment and performing its traditional role oversight of our
[35:23.040 --> 35:30.160]  government mr. Dobbs you are you know a student of history a veteran
[35:30.160 --> 35:33.880]  journalist and so you were able to chart exactly what's happened and you were
[35:33.880 --> 35:39.120]  now been proven right like a profit 28,000 plus dead in the last two and a
[35:39.120 --> 35:43.760]  half years on the US-Mexican border Mexico is now completely collapsed the
[35:43.760 --> 35:47.560]  poor woman has her husband killed the media tries to imply she's a liar now
[35:47.560 --> 35:51.160]  the investigator that goes to look at it from the Mexican government has his
[35:51.160 --> 35:56.200]  head chopped off and delivered to the Mexican military and then you're
[35:56.200 --> 36:01.520]  criticized for simply pointing out that we've got to protect our border yeah
[36:01.520 --> 36:06.520]  it's interesting isn't it Alex that if you speak truth to power as you and I do
[36:06.520 --> 36:13.400]  each and every day that you are a target for those who want to ignore the the
[36:13.400 --> 36:19.360]  breach of security in this country the the border that is no longer
[36:19.360 --> 36:23.920]  recognized apparently by this administration as being a demarcation
[36:23.920 --> 36:29.640]  of sovereignty the suggestion in the national media that this woman with her
[36:29.640 --> 36:37.400]  husband shot dead a falcon late he is somehow not a victim any longer but
[36:37.400 --> 36:46.120]  part of some sort of you know I don't know conspiracy some sort of plot that
[36:46.120 --> 36:50.560]  has nothing to do with the the failure of the government of Mexico
[36:50.560 --> 36:58.960]  narco state terror that is raining across most of northern Mexico this is
[36:58.960 --> 37:04.160]  mad I talked to a state senator from Texas who'd been in secret homeland
[37:04.160 --> 37:07.400]  security meetings last year saying that they are preparing for the complete
[37:07.400 --> 37:11.640]  collapse of Mexico with Homeland Security to protect the border and Rick
[37:11.640 --> 37:14.880]  Perry's been begging Obama but I've had sheriff's son from South Texas and
[37:14.880 --> 37:18.920]  Arizona now you've seen you know also them separately in the news where they
[37:18.920 --> 37:22.240]  asked for more funds and instead of more funds they've actually had their
[37:22.240 --> 37:25.760]  funding cut and now they've pulled the border patrol back 10 miles on the
[37:25.760 --> 37:30.360]  Arizona border 80 miles in as you know they put up signs telling people don't
[37:30.360 --> 37:35.040]  go down this road don't go in this National Park we're really seating areas
[37:35.040 --> 37:39.680]  now to the Mexican drug cartels and the Mexican military involved with them in
[37:39.680 --> 37:49.760]  many cases so that the la reconquista is is here you point out that again that
[37:49.760 --> 37:56.440]  moving the border patrol back putting in a few hundred national guards but to
[37:56.440 --> 38:02.400]  support a border patrol that is demoralized and not adequately deployed
[38:02.400 --> 38:08.280]  for the apprehension of illegal immigrants in this country people need to
[38:08.280 --> 38:13.280]  understand that the police called around may have had something right and has
[38:13.280 --> 38:17.640]  not been given credit for because police called around a year ago said
[38:17.640 --> 38:23.920]  corruption is not only a problem south of that border with the United States that
[38:23.920 --> 38:30.600]  comment meant what with almost no real serious coverage in the again in the
[38:30.600 --> 38:36.280]  US media but there has to be an understanding in amongst the American
[38:36.280 --> 38:42.760]  people that this level of this level of corruption that we focus on in
[38:42.760 --> 38:47.760]  Mexico is being now met on our side of the border there is no other way you
[38:47.760 --> 38:51.960]  know when all else fails what's the cause of the fact that's my father always
[38:51.960 --> 38:57.360]  taught me and there is a reason that these borders remain wide open there is
[38:57.360 --> 39:02.280]  a reason that illegal immigrants continue to cross over the border there
[39:02.280 --> 39:08.000]  is a reason that Mexico remains the principal source of methamphetamines
[39:08.000 --> 39:15.160]  marijuana heroin and cocaine injuring the United States and we don't and we
[39:15.160 --> 39:21.480]  have a national media that doesn't even ask the question why because the big
[39:21.480 --> 39:25.560]  banks in the US has come out in Bloomberg and Reuters have admitted in
[39:25.560 --> 39:29.760]  federal court they are laundering billions and even buying aircraft for
[39:29.760 --> 39:33.000]  the drug dealers
[39:37.000 --> 39:42.320]  our finance of this country could not understand that they have to have the
[39:42.320 --> 39:49.320]  implicit acquiesce of a financial system to move the billions and billions of
[39:49.320 --> 39:57.520]  dollars required to both supply and provide and buy all of these illegal
[39:57.520 --> 40:03.320]  drugs we have been waiting a war on drugs and this superpower the greatest
[40:03.320 --> 40:07.960]  economy on the face of the earth the greatest democracy has had been able
[40:07.960 --> 40:15.280]  to win now is the time to ask why and the reason they answer and my judgment
[40:15.280 --> 40:21.520]  lies in one word corruption absolutely loom we were very honored to have you
[40:21.520 --> 40:25.560]  know you have a very busy schedule that we got you on about 14 minutes late I
[40:25.560 --> 40:30.800]  need to apologize for that Alex I apologize for family I hope that you
[40:30.800 --> 40:36.840]  want me if you will make that up to you in any way possible oh no no no no it
[40:36.840 --> 40:40.480]  no sir you're gracious I just because I didn't get a chance to talk to you before
[40:40.480 --> 40:44.080]  we went live I just have to ask you on air we we've got to take a break in about
[40:44.080 --> 40:50.120]  nine minutes is there a way to keep you to 40 after you betcha oh sir thank you
[40:50.120 --> 40:53.400]  so much because I just want to make sure I can get to all these questions all of
[40:53.400 --> 40:58.520]  this is connected we see the mortgages the derivatives package the credit
[40:58.520 --> 41:05.160]  default swaps China Europe American pensions being cheated we now find out
[41:05.160 --> 41:08.080]  that there is systemic fraud they're taking houses that they don't even have
[41:08.080 --> 41:12.760]  deeds to in some cases that are paid for all of that is happening you had talked
[41:12.760 --> 41:17.340]  about this years ago you talked about globalism killing our economy NAFTA and
[41:17.340 --> 41:22.040]  GATT again you've been a prophet it's all happened and it's the same banks
[41:22.040 --> 41:25.840]  laundering the drug money that are selling you know all these derivatives I
[41:25.840 --> 41:29.200]  mean this is really a criminal enterprise and as Ron Paul has said it's
[41:29.200 --> 41:34.280]  either us or them can you speak to that mr. Dobbs from again Lou Dobbs.com
[41:34.280 --> 41:39.320]  folks want to check the site out in the radio show out can you speak to the
[41:39.320 --> 41:43.120]  private fellow reserve the globalist the open announcements now of world
[41:43.120 --> 41:47.680]  government I mean that everything's happening
[41:47.680 --> 41:56.880]  and there is a time point of both policy initiatives and a great deal of
[41:56.880 --> 42:05.760]  rhetoric to to reinforce support those initiatives and as an example Alex last
[42:05.760 --> 42:13.160]  week Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geiger it's very important that we find
[42:13.160 --> 42:19.040]  a much deeper broader a much more profound role for the International
[42:19.040 --> 42:25.200]  Monetary Fund in the currency market it is one of the most alarming statements
[42:25.200 --> 42:28.880]  made by a man who I don't even think should be in the post frankly I think
[42:28.880 --> 42:33.560]  he should have been fired but I have to do reservations about the people who
[42:33.560 --> 42:39.000]  would have to fire it but the reality the reality is that a larger role for the
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.560]  International Monetary Fund is another step towards international government
[42:43.560 --> 42:49.240]  it's that straightforward it is that it is that simple this is an administration

[44:18.120 --> 44:23.240]  really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American

[47:00.600 --> 47:07.560]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones broadcasting
[47:07.560 --> 47:24.200]  network network
[47:24.200 --> 47:31.200]  What do you mean I don't believe in God, talk to him every day?
[47:31.200 --> 47:38.200]  What do you mean I don't support your system, I go to court when I have to?
[47:38.200 --> 47:42.200]  What do you mean I can't get to work on time?
[47:42.200 --> 47:51.200]  The G20 admits headed up by Geithner that they want a concerted global currency devaluation
[47:51.200 --> 47:55.200]  that coordinated to their word, they said this last year, they said it this year,
[47:55.200 --> 47:59.200]  so this isn't really a currency war, they've made an agreement to sink all the currencies
[47:59.200 --> 48:03.200]  and I'm sure you saw the Wall Street Journal last week and Bernanke and others say
[48:03.200 --> 48:08.200]  we're looking at inflation to quote fix the debt, that's Weimar Republic sir,
[48:08.200 --> 48:14.200]  exactly what you warned of many years ago, can you speak to how amazing it is that they send that signal
[48:14.200 --> 48:20.200]  and say we want a global VAT tax on every nation to fund the very private banks
[48:20.200 --> 48:25.200]  that have engineered our collapse, I mean that is global banking system taking over our society,
[48:25.200 --> 48:28.200]  I mean please speak to that.
[48:28.200 --> 48:35.200]  I have to laugh at this VAT tax, this value added tax, this consumption tax,
[48:35.200 --> 48:44.200]  this suddenly the darling of the globalist who really see in it the capacity to bring in
[48:44.200 --> 48:52.200]  even more private sector capital to and turn it over to government, the public sector.
[48:52.200 --> 48:57.200]  We are in a struggle right now in this country and I think in many parts of the world,
[48:57.200 --> 49:03.200]  but principally in the United States, a struggle between the public and the private sector
[49:03.200 --> 49:09.200]  that will determine whether or not we the people are working for our government
[49:09.200 --> 49:17.200]  or our government is working for us and the idea that it is somehow logical, sensible
[49:17.200 --> 49:24.200]  or makes any kind of economic sense for this great free enterprise capitalist economy of ours
[49:24.200 --> 49:31.200]  to be further burned with a VAT tax which arises to 20% of some cases in Europe.
[49:31.200 --> 49:37.200]  In addition to the tax burden that we're already under,
[49:37.200 --> 49:42.200]  this would bring the back of the free enterprise system in this country in my judgment
[49:42.200 --> 49:49.200]  and it's out of accident that these folks, these advocates for the VAT
[49:49.200 --> 49:53.200]  have to be led by this administration.
[49:53.200 --> 49:58.200]  Well Lou, I mean watching George Soros' media matters, outfits and others
[49:58.200 --> 50:05.200]  demonize you on a weekly basis, myself, Ron Paul, and say we're lunatics making up world government,
[50:05.200 --> 50:10.200]  I've seen Time, Newsweek, Financial Times of London, Wall Street Journal all say
[50:10.200 --> 50:14.200]  world government is here, it's going to be run by the very banks that engineered
[50:14.200 --> 50:20.200]  the Washington Post says $600 trillion unpayable derivatives black hole
[50:20.200 --> 50:25.200]  and we're just looking at what they're doing, what they're saying
[50:25.200 --> 50:31.200]  and they think so little of the public that they go out and say we're crazy liars Lou.
[50:31.200 --> 50:36.200]  I mean sometimes do you pinch yourself like it's a dream or the twilight zone?
[50:36.200 --> 50:44.200]  Well, I think most Americans, I have a pretty clear idea what this country was founded on,
[50:44.200 --> 50:50.200]  the values, the ideals that are critically important to the success of this nation
[50:50.200 --> 50:52.200]  over the course of more than 200 years.
[50:52.200 --> 50:57.200]  I don't believe those values and those ideals should be fundamentally transformed
[50:57.200 --> 51:01.200]  as this president asked five days before the inauguration.
[51:01.200 --> 51:08.200]  I have absolutely faith in this system, this political system of ours, this economic system of ours
[51:08.200 --> 51:16.200]  and I think that anyone advocating a change is, as President Obama put it,
[51:16.200 --> 51:22.200]  a fundamental transformation of America has better be asking why and to what end
[51:22.200 --> 51:27.200]  and what would be the vision that would replace this great nation of ours
[51:27.200 --> 51:34.200]  and why is it that this administration is so utterly committed to apologizing
[51:34.200 --> 51:39.200]  for America's success, for American exceptionalism
[51:39.200 --> 51:48.200]  at a time when we need positive leadership to drive both our economy and our financial system.
[51:48.200 --> 51:52.200]  If one looks at what this administration has done since taking off,
[51:52.200 --> 52:01.200]  decrying the economy for a brief period while it's succeeded in achieving an $800 billion stimulus law
[52:01.200 --> 52:07.200]  is now running down the economy and talking down markets
[52:07.200 --> 52:14.200]  rather than bolstering its small investor enthusiasm, small business energy.
[52:14.200 --> 52:16.200]  It makes no sense.
[52:16.200 --> 52:20.200]  This is the most negative leadership one could have imagined from a candidate
[52:20.200 --> 52:24.200]  who talked about the audacity of hope and hope and change.
[52:24.200 --> 52:27.200]  Again, folks, join us at ludobbs.com.
[52:27.200 --> 52:32.200]  But specifically, they've blamed capitalism in the free market for what's happening,
[52:32.200 --> 52:35.200]  but as Ron Paul and you and others have pointed out the obvious,
[52:35.200 --> 52:40.200]  it's the megabanks who are not free market, who sell fraudulent derivatives,
[52:40.200 --> 52:44.200]  the megabanks that want the world government, they get our tax money,
[52:44.200 --> 52:50.200]  basically conduit it to them, banksters, teamed up with government worldwide.
[52:50.200 --> 52:53.200]  What we're seeing happening here is happening all over the planet.
[52:53.200 --> 52:57.200]  Yeah, and what we are watching, as you and I were discussing,
[52:57.200 --> 53:02.200]  is not only a coordinated effort to not...
[53:02.200 --> 53:06.200]  One would think that would be to support the strength of the dollar
[53:06.200 --> 53:09.200]  in currency markets and the forex market around the world,
[53:09.200 --> 53:17.200]  but instead to, it seems, of every opportunity to kick the force off from under the dollar.
[53:17.200 --> 53:22.200]  You do not hear this administration talking about a commitment to the strength of the dollar.
[53:22.200 --> 53:28.200]  And what is strange is to see this obvious, desperate desire on a part of temporary guidance
[53:28.200 --> 53:33.200]  of the Treasury Secretary and the G20 members
[53:33.200 --> 53:39.200]  to defer to the victor of the communist Chinese economy.
[53:39.200 --> 53:41.200]  It's extraordinary.
[53:41.200 --> 53:44.200]  And then to carry on a national conversation,
[53:44.200 --> 53:47.200]  instead of about the role of the Federal Reserve,
[53:47.200 --> 53:55.200]  what will be its level of commitment to stable prices in this domestic economy in particular,
[53:55.200 --> 54:00.200]  but instead talk about what China should be doing with the law,
[54:00.200 --> 54:03.200]  rather than talking about U.S. policy,
[54:03.200 --> 54:11.200]  as if the answer here is to dictate communist Chinese policy in the global economy.
[54:11.200 --> 54:13.200]  That's an absurdity.
[54:13.200 --> 54:15.200]  Sir, sir, sorry to interrupt.
[54:15.200 --> 54:17.200]  Is that not treason?
[54:17.200 --> 54:22.200]  I mean, we know the policy for several years has been to allow quiet dollar devaluation.
[54:22.200 --> 54:24.200]  The G20 said that, but now they're saying it's a good thing.
[54:24.200 --> 54:32.200]  I mean, is that not fundamental sabotage against our nation to have a policy of devaluing the dollar?
[54:32.200 --> 54:36.200]  The policy of devaluing, whether one wants to construct that is treason.
[54:36.200 --> 54:41.200]  Alex, I think it depends upon whether or not one believes it will be absolute first,
[54:41.200 --> 54:46.200]  it will be successful, or simply a discussion of a preferred policy.
[54:46.200 --> 54:50.200]  I personally will not call it treason yet,
[54:50.200 --> 54:58.200]  but we will watch very carefully to see where these policy recommendations go, where they continue.
[54:58.200 --> 55:08.200]  Secondly, the idea that these policy recommendations would focus with the national media, again, acquiescence,
[55:08.200 --> 55:16.200]  the national media is not asking why should the Obama administration be focusing on the policies of a sovereign state,
[55:16.200 --> 55:24.200]  which is the communist Chinese, rather than the policies over which we have control, the U.S. government policy,
[55:24.200 --> 55:31.200]  for which we are responsible, and by the way, by pursuing correct policies,
[55:31.200 --> 55:40.200]  it seems to me, Alex, that there's a difference between being international traders and being globalists,
[55:40.200 --> 55:49.200]  and being globalists don't care how much of a trade debt we run up, or how many consecutive years of deficits we run,
[55:49.200 --> 55:58.200]  and those of us who believe in fair international trade believe it should be the precisely the same policy pursued by our trade...
[55:58.200 --> 56:00.200]  Yeah, fair trade, not free trade.
[56:00.200 --> 56:04.200] ...reciprocal, absolutely, mutual, reciprocal, and balanced trade.
[56:04.200 --> 56:07.200]  I mean, all of these international agreements are all one-sided,
[56:07.200 --> 56:11.200]  and you're absolutely right about that, and you've been proven right in spades.
[56:11.200 --> 56:13.200]  Now, a bunch of quick questions while we have you, sir.
[56:13.200 --> 56:21.200]  Again, Lou Dobbs joining us, indicated radio host, former top CNN host, and let's get into that issue.
[56:21.200 --> 56:26.200]  When are we going to be seeing Lou Dobbs back on television with your number one show?
[56:26.200 --> 56:33.200]  Everybody is just basically demanding it. When are we going to see Lou Dobbs back on television?
[56:33.200 --> 56:39.200]  I think we'll know probably here in the next month or so when that will be.
[56:39.200 --> 56:45.200]  Lou, another question back to banking. I'm sure you've seen the mainstream news articles in CNBC,
[56:45.200 --> 56:53.200]  where the government's saying we may take over the private pensions to protect them after they've destroyed them and put a tax on them.
[56:53.200 --> 56:57.200]  Boy, I mean, is that a recipe for revolt politically?
[56:57.200 --> 57:02.200]  Yes, that is a recipe for rebellion, a peaceful rebellion.
[57:02.200 --> 57:10.200]  We're going to have to be an accounting, and accounting in this case means people understand the tax payer,
[57:10.200 --> 57:17.200]  the private sector tax payer simply can no longer afford to support public sector employment
[57:17.200 --> 57:23.200]  that provides salaries well beyond those of the private sector for like work
[57:23.200 --> 57:31.200]  and provides retirement and healthcare benefits far in excess of anything that the private sector tax payer
[57:31.200 --> 57:33.200]  has for himself or herself.
[57:33.200 --> 57:37.200]  All right, Lou Dobbs, look forward to speaking to you again and seeing you back on television.
[57:37.200 --> 57:40.200]  God bless you and say hi to your wife and your great family.
[57:40.200 --> 57:43.200]  Thank you so much, Alex, and same time to ask.
[57:43.200 --> 57:50.200]  All right, there goes Lou Dobbs, ladies and gentlemen.
[57:50.200 --> 57:55.200]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[57:55.200 --> 57:59.200]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin soap company,
[57:59.200 --> 58:01.200]  owned and operated American company.
[58:01.200 --> 58:05.200]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me
[58:05.200 --> 58:08.200]  how much they love these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[58:08.200 --> 58:13.200]  There is nothing like these factory direct big money saving triple concentrated soaps anywhere.
[58:13.200 --> 58:18.200]  Get a free detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091
[58:18.200 --> 58:22.200]  or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[58:22.200 --> 58:26.200]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[58:26.200 --> 58:32.200]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[58:32.200 --> 58:36.200]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[58:36.200 --> 58:45.200]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 to visit our website, 5starsoap.com
[58:45.200 --> 58:50.200]  for buying a one to two month soap sampler. Thank you.
[58:50.200 --> 58:55.200]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[58:55.200 --> 58:58.200]  with your self produced colloidal silver solutions,
[58:58.200 --> 59:01.200]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs system
[59:01.200 --> 59:06.200]  and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[59:06.200 --> 59:11.200]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[59:11.200 --> 59:15.200]  Not only does the Silver Lungs system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[59:15.200 --> 59:19.200]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed
[59:19.200 --> 59:23.200]  to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[59:23.200 --> 59:31.200]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system.
[59:31.200 --> 59:35.200]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs system
[59:35.200 --> 59:41.200]  at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs system works.
[59:41.200 --> 59:45.200]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[59:45.200 --> 59:49.200]  That's www.silverlungs.com
[59:49.200 --> 59:54.200]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[59:54.200 --> 59:59.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[59:59.200 --> 01:00:04.200]  We are back live for the rest of this hour.
[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:09.200]  Judge Andrew Apolitano, former state judge,
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:14.200]  number one show now on Fox Business, going to
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:19.200]  Daily Weekdays. It's so successful.
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:24.200]  We are back live for the rest of this hour.
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:29.200]  We are back with Fox Business.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:33.200]  We are back live for the rest of this hour.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:43.200]  We are back live for the rest of this hour.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:48.280]  in his weekend show, I said, I said, you watch, it's going to have, you know, massive ratings
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:52.640]  and you were like, I just hoped to do okay. And you remember on air and off air, judge,
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:59.120]  I told you, you did, Alex. And you were right. And I have been surprised and delighted that
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:04.520]  the generosity of viewers, we've been doing very, very well and management decided to
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:10.680]  take us daily. And we expect that that will happen before Thanksgiving daily on Fox business
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:16.560]  we will continue the show on weekends. Basically, we will take one of the five dailies and run
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:22.840]  it as the weekend show. But our prime work will be prime time. I don't know the time.
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:28.480]  It'll be prime time on the Fox business network with the full support of the business network
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:33.080]  and many, many cross promotions on the Fox News channel and my continued appearances
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:38.760]  on the Fox News channel and my continued fill ins for Glenn Beck, which I'm doing as soon
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:45.320]  as next Tuesday. Are you influencing Glenn because he is getting more and more hardcore?
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:49.200]  Last night we played a clip earlier in the show. He talked about the Thavian socialists
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:54.320]  wanting to poison the water supply and I don't want to take credit for influencing him. I
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:59.480]  will tell you this, we spend a lot of time together. We do a lot of speaking gigs together
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:03.480]  when you travel with Glenn, you travel first class or we're in a small private jet and
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:09.120]  we do a lot of talking. He has told me that I have changed his mind on two issues. One
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:15.440]  is the Patriot Act and the other is the morality, lawfulness and constitutionality or lack thereof
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:21.880]  of torture. So I will only take credit for those two areas which are profound. I did
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:26.240]  not hear what he said about the Thavian socialists and I didn't hear what he said about poisoning
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:31.280]  the water supply until you told me because I was on another show last night when he said
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:37.680]  that. But I'm not surprised that he said it. I'm happy that he's issuing those warnings
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:41.800]  and Alex, those warnings are resonating with people. You've been saying this for years now.
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:46.360]  He's saying it between the two of you. That is a monstrous audience hearing these things.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:52.760]  Well every day for two years I have shown the quotes from Ecoscience where Holdren
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:59.080]  said reduced population of planetary tyranny to do it. Four sterilizations of the water.
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:06.040]  Beck quoted Ecoscience word for word last night. He played George Bernard Shaw. I mean
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:12.520]  literally I've been critical of Beck on torture and the police state and things he supported.
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:21.280]  But I know it shows one thing. The mood of the country has changed. If Judge Andrew Napolitano
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:26.000]  has the number one show on Fox Business and is getting a prime time show weekdays and
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.400]  Glenn Beck is now able to go on the air and talk about things that 15 years ago I was
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:36.520]  called a lunatic for when all I was doing was reading their own statements.
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:41.400]  Well you have to add to that and I'm not just blowing smoke at you. You have to add to that
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:46.840]  the phenomenal success of your own show. People have awakened. When people ask me about the
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:52.800]  tea parties I take them back to my youth. This is before you were born. When Barry Goldwater
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:58.800]  ran against the LBJ. That is the last time I can and I was 13 years old. That's the last
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:06.080]  time I can remember as serious and as profound a debate about the Constitution and the role
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:11.440]  of the federal government in the lives of individuals in the past 50 years.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:15.040]  And Goldwater came out and quoted the trial lateral commission's plan to set up World
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:20.120]  Government how the banks would bankrupt us and now here we are 40 something years later
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:27.560]  it was like Barry Goldwater was a profit. Exactly. Goldwater was terrific. To me the
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:32.040]  tea parties are bringing, except on defense because I think you would have waged offensive
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:37.480]  wars which you and I and most of the folks listening to us now would not. I agree. And
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:41.480]  it's like saying you know aside from what happened in the theater Mrs. Lincoln had
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:46.920]  it to like the evening because it's a big accept but generally on the role of the government
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:51.960]  in the lives of people generally unlimited government generally on sound money he was
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:05:03.800]  terrific. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:08.760]  power generator. Number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:13.800]  bill. Number two our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:18.880]  allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:23.600]  grid technology is coming. Number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:29.160]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:33.480]  Number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:37.640]  of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five a solar power
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:42.040]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks I really believe in
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:46.280]  the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science one of my oldest sponsors. You
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:53.200]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com. Remember the government
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:06:02.960]  doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365 okay judge we've only
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:06.320]  got you here for about another 20 minutes before the show ends I want to race through
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:10.040]  a bunch of issues and then find out what is most important on your radar go right ahead
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:14.280]  but I would imagine being so well read you know the Supreme Court justices and the LA
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:19.400]  Times covered this here's the headline First Amendment ruling destined to kill internet
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:26.040]  free speech they said that in the case of the funeral protesters who I disagree with
[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:31.920]  but it's their right that they are going to restrict rallies protest things that hurt
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:37.400]  people's feelings England has just passed similar laws the cyber security act did this
[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:41.520]  they couldn't pass the cyber bullying last year and so they're now legislating from the
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:47.680]  bench they have signaled and said that they are going to rule against rallies and demonstrations
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:53.560]  that are hurtful and one justice said this will also affect internet speech that then
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:07:00.760]  dovetails with Microsoft proposes government licensing internet access I mean this can
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:05.720]  you speak about the state of free speech in this country here's another one Obama administration
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:12.480]  pressures ISPs to censor websites without even an order the White House just tells
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:17.360]  them what they want taken down outside of a court and it happens I mean this is becoming
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:24.200]  Maoist China well I disagree with the view of those who say the court is going to go
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:30.000]  against free speech I was not in the courtroom I read a portion of the transcript of the
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:35.200]  oral argument and I interrogated the Fox reporter who was in the courtroom that Fox
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:40.240]  reporter not a lawyer but a person who covers the Supreme Court for Fox is of the view that
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:46.200]  it's going to go in favor of free speech and this court and no court is perfect and a lot
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:51.760]  of judges most of the legislation the bench but this Supreme Court with with Stevens
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:58.800]  on it before Kagan got there invalidated laws that prohibited the slaughter of animal on
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:05.800]  tapes a horrible thing that I oppose but free speech invalidated laws that prohibited corporations
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:11.640]  and labor unions and advocacy groups from getting involved in in free speech I believe
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:16.760]  that this case is going to go as horrific as the message is in favor of the freedom of
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:21.600]  the messengers in this case let's hope you're right but but and we'll find out soon but
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:26.880]  the other issue is what about all these moves with cyber security the Obama kill switch
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:30.680]  all these different stuff has to be challenged and has to be challenged in a couple ways
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:34.800]  one the way you're doing it by exposing it because most people don't know about this
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:40.200]  unless they hear it from you or or or Sassel or Beck or me because there are very few national
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:44.160]  broadcasters addressing this and secondly it needs to be challenged in the political
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:49.240]  arena the people who do it need to be voted out of office or exposed and forced to explain
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:52.880]  themselves in which case they'll be forced out of office and then of course it needs
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:58.840]  to be challenged but the court has been pretty good on First Amendment I mean the court has
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:05.800]  let circuit court opinions stand which invalidated efforts to cleanse the internet of pornography
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:09.440]  whatever you think of pornography these things were written supposedly to protect children
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:13.560]  it's always for the children and circuit courts of appeals that's the intermediate appellate
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:19.600]  court throughout the country have invalidated legislation under a Clinton under Bush and
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:24.640]  under Obama and the Supreme Court has refused to accept the government's appeals to overturn
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:30.880]  those invalidations so they haven't been bad on the First Amendment now we run the risk
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:39.120]  of a social conservative like my college classmate Sam Alito joining the big government liberals
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:45.440]  we run that risk of them thinking what they know is best for us to watch and listen to
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:53.000]  and hear but if Justice Alito sticks to the guns so to speak of those who voted for the
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:58.120]  First Amendment the last time around I think the First Amendment will prevail well even
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:03.200]  if the court says we don't have a First Amendment possession is nine-tenths of the law we need
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:08.520]  to continue to exercise it just like McCain Feingold tried to block free speech people
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:16.920]  just ignored it absolutely absolutely I mean the other thing is I mean the the the the
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:23.720]  the judgment against Phillips here was provided under some Maryland law now some states would
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:28.240]  not have such laws some states would say you can stand on the sidewalk and say whatever
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:34.480]  you want this creates the bizarre conundrum of the First Amendment meaning different
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:39.480]  things in different states so if the Supreme Court says this is okay we're going to uphold
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:43.520]  this judgment to about eight million dollars which the church doesn't have so it may just
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:50.480]  be a paper judgment that may not be the law of the land in all 50 states my own home state
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:56.680]  of New Jersey regrettably one of the most progressive in the Union nevertheless is superb
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:01.080]  on free speech under new to the New Jersey Constitution you can stand on the street corner
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:05.560]  and say whatever you want to whomever you want at any time you want as long as you're
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:10.160]  not you know preventing people from walking or preventing traffic I understand judge on
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:15.400]  this legal issues obviously you could teach us all day and we appreciate you joining us
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:19.600]  on that subject but but last question when should the court then release their ruling
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:25.760]  in the next two three months you know they release a bunch of rulings three times right
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:31.560]  before Christmas in the middle of the spring or say around April and then in June I think
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:35.640]  this one's probably going to come in April I don't think this is going to come until
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:40.280]  next year not for any political reason but just because the process of getting something
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:45.240]  like this done takes time okay I've got a stack of other important issues go you talked
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:50.200]  about the Federal Reserve getting more power it did get more power out of the crisis it
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:56.200]  created they were able to block a true audit in the Senate now it's being reported that
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:03.880]  821.1 billion of US Treasury notes are now owned by the private Federal Reserve they
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:11.720]  are now the second biggest owner of our debt next to communist China the Federal Reserve
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:16.640]  is moving ahead with quantitative easing the dollar is plunging gold is going up it's becoming
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:25.760]  more and more clear that we have a financial military style occupation of our country and
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:29.720]  the bankers are getting record bonuses they're openly not telling Congress where the trillions
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:34.560]  are this is insane give us your take on the Federal Reserve being the second biggest owner
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:39.400]  of our debt I mean talk about national security a private banking cartel and the communist
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:44.520]  Chinese I mean this is incredible well I actually think it's worse than that Alex I was on
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:49.200]  air with one of my colleagues speculating about what might happen if the Republicans
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:53.800]  take the House and the Republicans take the Senate and the colleagues said well at least
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:13:00.040]  they can refuse to fund Finreg the Financial Regulatory Act the so-called Dodd Frank Act
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:06.160]  and I said well most respectfully they can't it's under the domain of the Federal Reserve
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:10.800]  it doesn't need any funding the Federal Reserve can print its own money and fund it itself
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:15.880]  so the Federal Reserve is probably the most powerful entity on the planet more powerful
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:19.960]  than the rest of the federal government combined it's certainly the most secretive this is
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:25.800]  a one-liner you that you've used the job of the CIA is to keep and to steal secrets we
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:30.840]  know more about the CIA and what it has kept and what it has stolen and then we do about
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:36.920]  the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve announced yesterday that it's ready to infuse
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:42.360]  another trillion dollars of cash into the marketplace what will that do to the value
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:47.880]  of the dollar in the wallet of everybody listening in the bank account of everybody listening
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:51.960]  invested in the business of everyone listening who's invested in a business and invested
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:57.640]  in the home of everyone listening owns a home it will decrease its value when Jefferson
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:04.320]  and company were running the government in 1792 the Congress enacted the Coinage Act
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:11.800]  after 1792 which made it punishable by death for anybody in the government to clip coins
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:19.240]  stated differently to devalue the money the Federal Reserve is doing exactly that which
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:25.760]  was death penalty eligible when sound money existed in the country this is the most serious
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:32.280]  of problems we face we need to audit the Federal Reserve we need to audit gold knocks and I
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:37.640]  mean a real audit we may open up the door and find a a stadium full of gold but we need
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:41.960]  it could be hypothecated it could be pledged it could be there but owned by the Bank of
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:46.440]  China we need to own who owned we need to know who owns what we need to know every penny
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:51.440]  the Federal Reserve has printed every dime the Federal Reserve has spent every quarter
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:55.960]  the Federal Reserve has loaned every dollar the Federal Reserve is expecting back now
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:15:02.040]  are we gonna get that I just put this question to Ron Paul not an hour ago in the taping of
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:06.920]  my weekend show he thinks we're going to get these answers but not tomorrow and not as
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:12.360]  a result of this election and not even during the presidency of this president but in our
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:18.880]  lifetimes he thinks we will reach such a crisis point which he calls a revolution where the
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:24.520]  government will be forced to expose what it's been doing what it owns what it's been cheating
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:27.720]  what it's been stealing or the government will collapse like the government of the Soviet
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:33.480]  Union did well judge that's the issue is that you have the Vatican you have the city of London
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:38.600]  within London the private banking group you have Cheney a few years ago saying I'm my
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:43.560]  own branch of government the Federal Reserve has actually gotten Congress to legislate that
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:50.120]  they are literally the foxes guarding the hen houses they are destroying our society
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:57.400]  and they are the US version of the most powerful thing on the planet the private banking cartel
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:05.640]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over it ended on June of
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:11.560]  2009 the millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps a recession ended
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:16.120]  for the bankers and government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be getting worse
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:21.240]  gold and silver haven't heard the news either they've begun their long expected journey to the moon
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:25.880]  in addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver you should consider a food

[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:33.800]  conspiracy icon as he's known david ike is our guest i agree with about 98 percent of what david
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:40.760]  ike says he's so articulate former head of the green party in the uk uh the best-selling author
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:46.920]  many times over championship golly very articulate you can really put things in easy to understand
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:52.440]  ways he can really take complex issues and do that but david you know gets into basically
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:59.960]  something we never cover and that's interdimensional or extraterrestrial type entities but uh you
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:03.720]  know once something's out in the open once i can start proving that at least it's being discussed
[01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:10.040]  we're going to talk later at the start of the next hour about ufo's u s air force officers
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:16.760]  testify on ufo sightings at national press club they said they were turning off nukes uh it continues
[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:21.960]  church hill and eisenhower agreed to cover up raf planes ufo encountering world war two secret
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:29.080]  files reveal uh i mean it just goes on uh from there and and more and more the media is hyping
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:34.200]  some type of alien landing the unannounced last week they've appointed an ambassador to meet with
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:39.160]  the aliens we are on a planet out in the middle of space here you know orbiting the sun in the um

[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:14.840]  uh what's happening with the economy the awakening that's happening i want to ask david he's been
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:20.760]  very busy uh if he's seen this new video put out in england that they pulled by the 1010 project
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:25.000]  where it shows them murdering the children because they won't cut their carbon footprint
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.560]  and murdering football players and murdering talk show host and murdering people and businesses
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:35.000]  all these authority figures pushing a red button the message is we're your god we control you the
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:41.640]  system has gone from denying that they have a murderous agenda to coming out and saying we
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:47.160]  want eco fascism it isn't about global warming it's about reducing population you know man is a
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:51.320]  parasite man is the enemy they're teaching us to hate ourselves so we'll talk about that with
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:56.600]  david as well next but first david the economy gold at thirteen hundred and forty two dollars an ounce
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:03.240]  the currency is going down the open world government being announced riots all over europe
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:08.840]  against austerity uh you know you've you've been proven right gerald salente so much of what you
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:15.080]  talked about 15 16 years ago we're called a loon it's all coming true and right on the timeline
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:22.760]  you said david well i i said it uh to september 2008 alex when this uh the first uh
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:29.320]  recent crash uh became clear that there was a three step um a game going on here the first
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:34.760]  step was to crash the economy so that people could see there was a problem the next stage
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:41.640]  was to get governments to empty their barrels if you like to empty their ability to respond to it
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:47.960]  financially by hurling enormous fantastic cuckoo land amounts of money at the banking system which
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:53.880]  was uh designed from the start to disappear which of course the vast majority of it has
[01:23:53.880 --> 01:24:02.600]  and the third stage which um i'm now waiting for is when they make the judgment that um it's its
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:10.760]  optimum uh moment they crashed the economy again um in a way that governments uh have no longer any
[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:16.920]  means of responding to it even in the ludicrous way they did um in the last couple of years and
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:26.200]  then the banking system itself will be uh stepping forward as the uh the the savior and they'll say
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:34.920]  the only way of sorting out this global mess is an abcd and it will be a global economic tyranny
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:40.360]  based on a world central bank in which a few people sitting around one table will dictate uh
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:45.320]  finance to every country this of course is where we've been going all along you know if there's a
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:50.360]  few of you and compared with the uh seven billion we're supposed to have on this planet it is an
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:58.440]  absolute tiny few that are in full awareness behind this uh conspiracy and if they are going to
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:05.720]  reach their goal of a fully fledged global dictatorship then they have to incessantly
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:11.080]  centralize power and the more power they have the more power they have over more and more people
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:16.040]  and the more power they have centrally the more power they have to then centralize even quicker
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:22.120]  and this is why the uh speed of globalization in all areas of our lives has um has got faster and
[01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:28.760]  faster and of course the the Rockefeller Rothschild world trade organization is there to ensure that
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:34.280]  countries cannot defend themselves against the merciless world system so that every country
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:41.080]  is dependent on uh forces and events that are outside their sphere of influence and outside
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:47.640]  their sphere of control and response and this is the whole idea to get everyone uh dependent on
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:54.600]  everyone else so that the few people at the center running this system um have have power over
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:26:01.960]  every area of our lives i was talking to a uh a journalist yesterday in in england uh a mainstream
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:07.480]  journalist who was who was like saying he's seeing it the centralization of power in the
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:15.960]  media is now blatant and we're now reaching that point i talked about 15 years ago where the uh
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:22.680]  agenda that for for decade after decade and deep century after century has operated in the shadows
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:28.120]  there comes a point where it has to break the surface when it's getting close to its final goal
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:34.280]  but close to introducing the new world it wants to well that new world is eventually going to
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:39.240]  break the surface where we can actually see it it has to otherwise it can't become the new world
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:44.760]  and we're now at that point and this is why we have a point here alex of tremendous challenge
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:51.480]  but tremendous opportunity because it's becoming so blatant more and more people are seeing what
[01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:56.600]  they couldn't see before so so it's a real fork in the road we're facing here and david you said
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:27:01.640]  that brilliantly uh and you didn't toot your horn properly yes two years ago you said we're
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:05.880]  going to have the banker bailouts that will exhaust the central governments the state
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:11.000]  governments the regional governments they will then announce a new global currency
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:16.440]  and that's in reuters and ap today the bandcore that will be digital that then nations will have
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:20.520]  to borrow from the banks that's made up out of nothing but if you go back to the trilateral
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:27.160]  commission public documents from the 70s they said we will interconnect the world we'll get
[01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:32.360]  everybody in debt we will set it up where everybody's dependent on each other we'll be outside of
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:38.840]  that as the global arbiters then we'll implode the world economy and announce the new one world
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:44.440]  government and we have those documents we have the club of rome the un the trilateral commission the
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:49.880]  cfr and so everything we've talked about has come true because we were reading their playbook
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:54.440]  and and and as you said they denied it denied it denied it in public though their white papers
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:59.880]  were available but not you know widely distributed now they're getting ready to have their full
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:06.200]  takeover so they have to go ahead and admit it's all real but say it's our savior david how do you
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:12.840]  see this playing out in year one year two year three year four year five you say and i tend to agree
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:21.640]  with you that the that the main flash isn't 2012 but projecting the lines forward around 2015 2016
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:27.160]  the riots have already begun the pentagon admits global meltdown but they say marshal laws the answer
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:32.840]  when they've engineered it the british ministry of defense says the same thing the un they are
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:38.120]  getting ready for this the rich are moving offshore to private redouts and islands they're
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:43.400]  hardening the police departments against the citizens google admits their nsa and can quote
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:47.400]  predict the future and are surveilling everything we're doing uh they're admitting they're taking
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:51.640]  our blood secretly at birth they're admitting the vaccines are killing us but they don't care
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:29:03.400]  i mean it's just all coming out this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:08.520]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:13.720]  your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:18.600]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:23.880]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:29.160]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:34.280]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:38.840]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:43.480]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:49.160]  offered by solution from science one of my old sponsors you can get more information at www dot

[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:11.720]  2009 the millions of americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps the recession ended for
[01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:16.120]  the bankers and government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be getting worse

[01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:17.400]  broadcasting network network the answer to 1984 is 1776
[01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:37.400]  you're listening to the alex jones
[01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:54.680]  yeah some people are waking up now that all of this is so apparent saying alex jones ron paul
[01:33:54.680 --> 01:34:01.240]  david i so many others were right but others are choosing to then out of fear just accept the evil
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:06.360]  because it's so overwhelming what's the psychological warfare point here and what do you see happening
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:12.680]  in these phases well i think first of all alex is uh as you uh you pointed out you know if you
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:17.640]  prepared to do the research and you prepared to focus your life on this stuff over the years you
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:23.720]  don't have to be a prophet because their stuff's written down i mean you know we knew what was coming
[01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:31.080]  because it's there to find if you want to look for it but we have reached this um amazing point
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:38.520]  where people are finding even those with that with their head in the sand by the way as i say my
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:43.560]  new book if you have your head in the sand you have to be on your knees and and the two things
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:47.400]  go together and it's time we got off our knees and to do that first of all we're going to get
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:51.480]  our heads out of the bloody sand and actually face what we're we're we're dealing with here
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:57.960]  and we're at this amazing point now where they can't hide it anymore and and humanity is faced with
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:05.480]  a choice that will be more and more difficult for for it to persuade itself and kid itself that
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:09.880]  there's not a choice to be made because it's really not happening it's just it's just conspiracy theory
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:17.720]  no no this is in our face now so we're entering um very fast alex a totally new phase in this in
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:25.880]  this game in this unfolding uh conspiracy to impose a global fascist communist state because
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:34.200]  they're both mask on the same face anyway and for me we are going to continue to go down this road
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:40.600]  for some years yet where it seems that this control system is going is going uh in incessantly in the
[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:46.760]  direction it wants to and is unstoppable but i am absolutely uh convinced that in the years between
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:54.600]  2016 to 2020 that period um then uh there is going to be enough people who have awoken to this and
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:36:00.600]  can see this at that this there's going to come a tipping point and they are trying to what they've
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:07.960]  been trying to do all these years um alex is to bring in the uh the surveillance the control
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:13.560]  the data surveillance the surveillance of where you go on the internet and surveillance of every
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:21.240]  area of your life to bring in um the more and more the militarization of of law enforcement
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:25.960]  even domestic law enforcement is happening all over the world you see the policemen now and often
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:31.400]  you can't tell them from um from the man and we see a total continuity of agenda where they do
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:36.280]  snatch and grabs in front of news cameras at the g20 in england at pittsburgh in the u.s in
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:42.440]  toronto in canada we see the same cameras the same body scanners we see global drills set up months
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:50.920]  ago uh for the surge on trains and uh bus stations and airports and they admit it's a global drill
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:58.200]  that coincides with the latest scare of terrorist bombers it's the same system the same nomenclature
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:02.920]  run by the same corporate board yeah but this is the point alex um while they've
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:09.640]  of course been using uh terrorists as the excuse and terrorism as as the as the excuse uh you know
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:15.880]  we well know that what it's really been uh constructed for and constantly added to for
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:20.840]  is that is the population the general population that's what it's for and it's not even for the
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:27.480]  the the population uh that will stay asleep or or or go into uh a freeze mode through fear of
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:32.760]  of of what they're seeing it's for those people are waking up and it's for those people are
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:39.400]  prepared to do something and so you know it's so important for people to appreciate that this
[01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:45.560]  is not laid up by the day or the month or the week or the year or even the decade this is
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:51.160]  this has been long projected forward and so all the different elements of it the understanding
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:58.440]  of what they're going to do in terms of uh the uh economic crash etc etc the way that's going to
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:05.480]  be received by the public we're seeing it now more and more unrest etc and a parallel to that
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:12.520]  another wing of this conspiracy has been preparing for this with the uh excuse of terrorism to bring
[01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:20.600]  in all these uh uh anti-terrorist laws and and and all these uh institutions to uh fight terrorism
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:27.560]  or to track terrorism which have all been designed for the general population all along and they
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:32.040]  admit that this is so central and this is what i talk about every day but you do it so eloquently
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:38.520]  95 percent of homeland securities for veterans gun owners libertarians conservatives anti-globalist
[01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:43.880]  anti-war people anybody that doesn't play along with their controlled paradigm and now we've gotten
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:51.960]  a secret uh department of justice new document up on info wars dot com doj urges citizens to report
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:59.560]  extremists handing out literature like the obama joker poster they do they are now it's come out
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:04.600]  that israeli companies were hired by his homeland security in pennsylvania to spy on mainline tea
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:09.960]  parties and state representatives and they said that the state reps may be terrorist i mean there
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:17.160]  is an arch and now dr spiegel admits the former uh east german stasi was hired in the u.s and in
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:23.720]  europe to help set up this grid i mean now the stasi are going to save us yeah well as we've reached
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:33.800]  the point where there's a new a new stage in the psychological warfare um up to this point it's been
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:42.760]  like keep it uh under wraps keep it secret um dismiss and ridicule so-called conspiracy theorists
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:48.120]  because it seems that the humans have a genetic inability to say the word conspiracy without
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:54.920]  following it with theory um and and and just say it's all a nonsense it's not really happening and
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:40:03.880]  that gives you uh a cover story and uh time to build your control system uh more and more powerfully
[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:09.240]  and in in more and more of the fine detail of people's lives but now we've reached another
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:15.560]  psychological point where they're basically saying yes i know a lot more people are going to see it
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:20.920]  now but it doesn't matter because we're all powerful and we can do what we like and we're
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:25.000]  going to show you that we can do what we like because we're going to put this on public display
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:30.760]  more and more and more now what are you going to do are you going to take us on because we're all
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:35.640]  powerful and we can do anything we want or are you going to just be like good little sheep and
[01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:41.880]  good little slaves and just do what you're told keep your head down keep your mouth shut and and and
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:48.280]  and hope that that will see you okay so they've now gone to the pure intimidation they've taken
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:54.760]  the velvet glove off and they go they go you bet we did we gave children syphilis uh in injections
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:41:00.520]  in Guatemala you bet we're poisoning your vaccine you bet we run death camps you bet uh you know
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:06.120]  howlburton and dinecore run child kidnapping rings you bet we're evil and and so they're trying to
[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:11.400]  intimidate us you bet we're watching you if you hand out any literature you don't do that in America
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:16.760]  or the uk you bet we're listening to your phone calls you bet we want to reduce your population
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:22.840]  just like all these new tv ads and cartoons and video games where it shows the environmentalists
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:27.640]  murdering people if they don't accept the carbon tax dictatorship have you seen that new video
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:33.800]  i've not but it it makes absolute sense to this whole thing that we're talking about here because
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:41.560]  we have reached the point now um where you know we've got to decide are we going to be uh people
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:48.040]  who are going to stand up or are we going to be mice and just scuffle away and try to hide in the
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:53.880]  corner in the skirting board somewhere because this is what they're saying to us now okay come on
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:58.920]  you can see it what you're going to do about it and and we need to um have the courage and the
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:05.560]  backbone um to to say yeah we're not having it we're not having it because this is the truth um
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:13.720]  um there's a fraction a fraction of the number of people in this world who are being manipulated
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:18.760]  who are being intimidated who are being uh having their lives controlled who have been
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:25.800]  turned into a slave race a fraction of those of that uh people on earth are actually doing it
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:32.600]  and the vast vast vast vast majority are having it done to them i think i see a way out of this
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:40.760]  and and you know if we realize that the number and the the number advantage the manipulated
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:48.360]  abused and suppressed have over those who are in full awareness doing it the game is over absolutely
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:55.240]  amen to that the enemy is now out in the open it is unclogged itself are you going to stand up
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:43:04.200]  against this because submitting to it means death hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:10.200]  in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:16.360]  agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the americans at home i have turned many influence
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:22.520]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:29.080]  us as american citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the
[01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:35.160]  criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:40.200]  government kim geithner bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:44.920]  is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:52.680]  washington dc we have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic on dvd at

[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:39.400]  we're live ladies and gentlemen eight minutes into hour number three it is tuesday the fifth
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:45.240]  day of october 2010 the iconic david ike is our guest we're going to talk about a host of other
[01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:50.280]  key issues here just a moment but finishing up if you just joined us david was getting into the fact
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:54.920]  that and if you go back to edward bernay's 80 years ago who advised the department of war and
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:59.320]  the department of defense and he's the reason you eat bacon with eggs he's the reason there's a music
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:05.320]  room you've got to have that piano in the house to be classy they wrote up the feminist movement
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:09.960]  to break up the family to get women working so they could double tax and break up families
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:14.040]  even if women wanted to stay home and raise the children they brag about this and they said the
[01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:19.800]  number one goal is to make you feel inadequate to make you feel worthless so they can then sell you
[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:25.240]  on their quote new ideas and what david was saying is mirrored by the article at prison
[01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:33.800]  planet dot com climate cult indoctrinating our kids with depraved death wish and it uh the second
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:39.720]  article watson wrote uh over the weekend on this climate cult indoctrinating our kids with depraved
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:46.360]  death wish and it deals with their teaching them you're worthless you're bad humans are evil so
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:50.840]  that we're already desensitized with violence and death on television and simulated murders
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:55.320]  so when we see the real thing a lot of people don't care watch some old lady hit by a car bleed
[01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:59.720]  to death for two hours in the street or a cop hit by a car you see these reports all the time
[01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:06.360]  people not rendering aid not just disliking themselves but hating everyone else they're
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:13.960]  destroying our our connectivity to each other and it's so wicked they don't want us to know how
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:20.760]  special we are the mind that gave you shakespeare and and and beto and uh and and socrates and
[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:27.160]  mathematics and max plank a hundred years ago 110 years ago now literally envisioning in his mind
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:33.320]  the you know atomic theory and and and atomic weapons and atomic energy a species that's brought
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:38.680]  us space travel we're supposed to love the dolphins love the elephants but then we're trash
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:43.080]  we're scum we're worthless we don't have a right to have children and this is so central
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:47.800]  david please continue well you know alex uh you know i've been writing my books for years that this
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:53.880]  is no new phenomenon um the process we're now experiencing um if if you want to use the version
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:59.960]  of time that we uh perceive as time then you're talking thousands probably tens of thousands
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:07.400]  maybe more uh years that this has been slowly but surely unfolding um and the same techniques have
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:11.960]  been used all along there'll be people listening to this program won't like this but you know what
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:19.160]  we're talking about here is the same principle as telling people that by by the very um fact that
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:26.200]  they were born the very process of birth they are a thinner and fundamental to that is to make people
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:33.240]  feel small insignificant they have no power because people who believe they have no power do not
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:39.800]  express the power they have because we are constantly expressing our self perception our
[01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:44.920]  self identity so if you can get people to feel that they are useless they're worthless they're
[01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:52.920]  just as uh uh prince philip once alluded to the humanity just a virus uh and basically just uh
[01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:57.320]  you should have contempt for yourself and everything that you stand for and the human race
[01:50:57.320 --> 01:51:02.680]  collection be the same then you you are going to perceive yourself in that way you're going to
[01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:08.360]  manifest your life in that way you're not going to see the true magnitude of who you are consciousness
[01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:14.600]  capable of all and and much greater feats of awareness and creation than even the one you've
[01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:21.240]  just uh listed alex this is who we really are now you imagine billions of people on this planet or
[01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:29.400]  in awareness of the full magnitude scale potential infinite possibility of who we are a few people
[01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:37.320]  controlling uh them from a central point forget it no chance so fundamental to this is to disconnect
[01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:45.000]  us from a true awareness of who we are and to put us both in a box of self perception of being
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:51.640]  worthless but also in a box of little me i have no power because people who think they have no power
[01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:58.920]  they look up um or look out to people who have the power and and and it's fun enough it is the
[01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:07.720]  perception that these few have power over us that leads to them having power over us all you can't
[01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:14.840]  this all too powerful there's nothing you can do about it watch me you know the numbers alone say
[01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:22.280]  that that that the game are you so well what's happening is they impose a predetermination
[01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:27.800]  that we're going to fail a predetermined uh a determination that we have no power so that
[01:52:27.800 --> 01:52:33.160]  people just think it's absolutely lost you've just got to go along with everything uh that's
[01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:39.400]  happening you have to submit to the evil and and they are just pushing this like never before now
[01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:45.240]  now david's shifting gears because i just said one thing i'll explain quickly um you know what
[01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:51.640]  we're talking about here is um connected to something that i've been writing about for some
[01:52:51.640 --> 01:52:57.320]  time i know i go into deeply into stuff sometimes that people go you know that's too far out for me
[01:52:57.320 --> 01:53:03.400]  but what the human body is um is a receiver transmitter of information it's like a computer
[01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:13.240]  now um if you program a computer like on a desktop you program that to only read information
[01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:19.560]  within certain firewalls then that will be the computer's reality that is what you're going
[01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:25.320]  to get on the screen in terms of the computer uh uh manifesting is well that's what the term
[01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:31.000]  conspiracy theory is they throw it out there as a computer command do not read this information
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:39.400]  do not see it disregarded so what they're doing is systematically programming humanity programming
[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:44.280]  the body computer which is the vehicle not the realize we are consciousness uh uh infinite
[01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:50.440]  awareness but it's the vehicle we use to experience this this reality we call we call the world um
[01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:57.320]  and it's systematically programming that computer through various means uh through through through
[01:53:57.320 --> 01:54:04.440]  educations from media through all these things um to only perceive a certain reality and in doing
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:11.400]  so what happens the computer only reads that reality and you do not uh then have the perception of
[01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:17.800]  the true magnitude of who we are now everything connects to everything else they are bombarding
[01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:25.960]  us with um electrochemical poisons and pollutions in food and drink and um the genetically modified
[01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:32.280]  food which is designed to genetically modify us genetically modify what genetically modify i.e.
[01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:38.920]  change the uh the way that the body computer um receives and transmits information that's
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:46.040]  what they're doing and and in all these ways they are destabilizing and limiting and distorting
[01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:54.360]  um how we uh read reality because on one level the body is clearly an electrochemical organism
[01:54:54.360 --> 01:55:01.480]  and it has a particular electrochemical balance it has a genetic balance it has a DNA balance
[01:55:01.480 --> 01:55:08.440]  and once you start um distorting that it no longer reads reality to the potential that it had before
[01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:14.040]  it's like having a virus in your desktop computer it doesn't work the same and this is what is
[01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:22.200]  happening it's a systematic distortion of the way we read reality by distorting the body chemically
[01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:29.400]  electromagnetically and also in the way that we perceive by the manipulation of the information
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:34.680]  we receive it's the information that we're receiving Alex from the the media in us that
[01:55:34.680 --> 01:55:40.600]  what bravely calls itself education and all these sources is is no different in its basic theme
[01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:45.800]  than actually programming a computer so it reads reality in a certain way that's what they're doing
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:52.040]  and i see an ace in the hole for the globalist because they admit with project blue beam
[01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:56.120]  and other reports that have been partially declassified that for 50 years
[01:55:56.840 --> 01:56:02.680]  the british government the pentagon and others have actually hyped ufo stories as a cover for
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:09.320]  some of their secret technology but also at a key point to unify the planet as kissinger talked about
[01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:15.480]  and ronald reagan and many others that what have aliens invaded we would then unify and the government
[01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:20.760]  admits they've got secret programs with huge hologram projectors you name it to have the
[01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:27.880]  christ return aliens land uh buddha mohammed they admit this and suddenly you have all these
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:31.800]  mainstream media reports we're going to go over after the break where they're saying oh looks like
[01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:37.160]  aliens might be real eisenhower and church shall new you know and now the un announces we've appointed
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:43.240]  an ambassador for when the aliens arrive i mean they're and and and and we've got you know top
[01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:49.160]  physicist uh coming out and saying the aliens are going to be mean when they come so this is a
[01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:56.360]  complex subject well slightly complex in that um there's two angles to it uh first of all the idea
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:57:04.840]  that humans are the only um uh species of like uh in in this universe is utterly utterly ludicrous
[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:11.160]  insane and beyond uh belief and one day uh when uh we wake up a bit more people are going to say
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:16.200]  how could we ever believe it in the same way as how could we ever believe the earth was uh flat
[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:24.360]  however governments and authorities are um looking at and responding to um information of this kind
[01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:31.080]  there has been a a blatant decision that there is going to be a total change more and more stuff out
[01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:35.480]  there it's not going to be laughter anymore and denied in the way it was before because they are
[01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:43.160]  building up to something here which will be a disclosure that will be uh a fake disclosure a
[01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:53.160]  disclosure that leads to um the reaction they want alex told you the government announced recently
[01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:59.160]  that the recession is over it ended on june of 2009 the millions of americans unable to find work
[01:57:59.160 --> 01:58:03.960]  might not agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for the
