[00:00.000 --> 00:20.120]  It's Tuesday, March 23rd, the year is 2021, I am your host Alex Jones and the entire planet
[00:20.120 --> 00:27.120]  and all of humanity is going through the most important test in all of our species development.
[00:27.120 --> 00:31.920]  We have a breakaway civilization of globalist establishing a scientific dictatorship and
[00:31.920 --> 00:38.840]  if they can get us to do absurd, stupid things and submit, they can roll out the next phases
[00:38.840 --> 00:39.960]  of their operation.
[00:39.960 --> 00:44.840]  They are now announcing in the UK, other blue states and blue cities in the US are announcing
[00:44.840 --> 00:51.960]  like Oregon, permanent mask never to be removed, permanent social distancing, permanently working
[00:51.960 --> 00:57.280]  from our homes unless we are specially authorized big tech company personnel or big box store
[00:57.280 --> 00:59.520]  Walmart or Amazon people.
[00:59.520 --> 01:01.120]  This is a total vertical integration.
[01:01.120 --> 01:03.520]  These companies are taking the planet over.
[01:03.520 --> 01:08.920]  What's left of Main Street, what's left of the farms, what's left of that is being destroyed
[01:08.920 --> 01:10.120]  all over the world.
[01:10.120 --> 01:15.120]  This is a systematic criminal plan where they train the domesticated public to sign on to
[01:15.120 --> 01:21.680]  it because they're heroes and they stay in for two weeks to cut the curve and they wear
[01:21.680 --> 01:25.560]  their mask to save lives and now they've come out and admitted, oh, this is really just
[01:25.560 --> 01:26.560]  the great reset.
[01:26.560 --> 01:30.800]  They came out the last few weeks and said, oh, we're just doing this to cut carbon footprint
[01:30.800 --> 01:31.800]  has nothing to do with COVID.
[01:31.800 --> 01:36.840]  COVID is just like the normal cold, normal flu and still the sheep will do it because
[01:36.840 --> 01:42.880]  they like to show how they're good and just get the mindless dopamine of being heroes
[01:42.880 --> 01:45.080]  that survived the apocalypse.
[01:45.080 --> 01:49.440]  When the real apocalypse is the great reset and the takeover, I'll be covering next segment.
[01:49.440 --> 01:54.800]  But now we see the pure evil arrogance of the puppet vice president Kamala Harris.
[01:54.800 --> 01:59.080]  Now all the powers of Joe Biden, the zombie president being transferred to her and she's
[01:59.080 --> 02:03.360]  getting on Air Force Two and we'll play the clip in a moment and they say, hey, are you
[02:03.360 --> 02:04.480]  any plans to go to the border?
[02:04.480 --> 02:09.120]  And she does her witches cackle because that's her answer to everything because she doesn't
[02:09.120 --> 02:10.840]  need to have voters.
[02:10.840 --> 02:12.640]  She doesn't need to be popular.
[02:12.640 --> 02:16.640]  She just needs to be a puppet and take the heat while the globalist collapse our country.
[02:16.640 --> 02:19.640]  Do you plan to visit the border?
[02:19.640 --> 02:21.640]  Not today.
[02:21.640 --> 02:29.920]  But I have before and I'm sure I will again.
[02:29.920 --> 02:35.080]  But it gets even worse with Saki saying there isn't a crisis at the border, there isn't
[02:35.080 --> 02:36.440]  a crisis at the border.
[02:36.440 --> 02:42.960]  She was confronted by the incredible project Veritas footage of scenes way worse than under
[02:42.960 --> 02:46.560]  Obama and way, way worse than under Trump who tried to fix it.
[02:46.560 --> 02:50.120]  And again, it's Joe Biden that said during the election, oh, surge the border if I get
[02:50.120 --> 02:51.400]  elected, I'll let you in.
[02:51.400 --> 02:52.600]  They're all wearing buying shirts.
[02:52.600 --> 02:56.160]  So they literally trigger this crisis, blame Trump, blame the American people, blame the
[02:56.160 --> 02:57.160]  border patrol.
[02:57.160 --> 03:00.200]  It's one of the best agencies we've got busting their ass.
[03:00.200 --> 03:02.920]  And then he says surge up here, but he's still the good guy.
[03:02.920 --> 03:08.920]  And then now here is the clip of Saki about our own troops being given metal shavings,
[03:08.920 --> 03:13.480]  getting, getting sick from the food, food poisoning, sleeping on the floor for months.
[03:13.480 --> 03:17.000]  She says, oh, well, Joe Biden at least said he was concerned.
[03:17.000 --> 03:18.800]  So it's a virtue signal.
[03:18.800 --> 03:19.800]  Let them eat cake.
[03:19.800 --> 03:20.800]  Here it is.
[03:20.800 --> 03:23.800]  Also, you are opening up new facilities, one of the options are being reported over
[03:23.800 --> 03:30.000]  the weekend is spending $86 million on hotel rooms for some migrants and feeding them.
[03:30.000 --> 03:39.120]  How do you square that with the National Guard troops who were sleeping in parking garages
[03:39.120 --> 03:44.000]  and feet, you know, some of them got sick from having contaminated food.
[03:44.000 --> 03:45.000]  That's a disparity.
[03:45.000 --> 03:48.800]  A lot of people are pointing out that our National Guard was treated one way.
[03:48.800 --> 03:52.400]  And then illegal immigrants are going to be put in hotel rooms.
[03:52.400 --> 03:58.600]  Well, first, let me say that at the time when we became aware of the conditions, National
[03:58.600 --> 04:05.280]  Guard troops were in parking garages, as you noted, the president called the head of the
[04:05.280 --> 04:11.480]  National Guard that day and offered his assistance, offered to play any role that he could play,
[04:11.480 --> 04:16.600]  boosting morale, asking for more aid, making sure they had the right, were treated in the
[04:16.600 --> 04:19.600]  way that they deserved for the incredible role they've played.
[04:19.600 --> 04:23.760]  So I know that was some time ago, but that was the reaction.
[04:23.760 --> 04:25.360]  They're rubbing your noses in it.
[04:25.360 --> 04:27.760]  They're testing to see what they can get away with.
[04:27.760 --> 04:30.120]  They're conditioning you to accept tyranny.
[04:30.120 --> 04:31.120]  Humanity must awaken and say no.
[04:31.120 --> 05:00.880]  As you know, we're always upping our game at M4.
[05:00.880 --> 05:05.680]  And we have a new product that we know you're going to love, especially if you have trouble
[05:05.680 --> 05:06.680]  sleeping.
[05:06.680 --> 05:07.680]  It is down and out.
[05:07.680 --> 05:09.420]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[05:09.420 --> 05:12.440]  We mean down your bed sleeping hard throughout the night.
[05:12.440 --> 05:15.500]  It's got four milligrams of high quality melatonin.
[05:15.500 --> 05:18.040]  It's got 25 milligrams of passion flower.
[05:18.040 --> 05:21.720]  It's got 50 milligrams of valerian root extract concentrate.
[05:21.720 --> 05:26.080]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[05:26.080 --> 05:29.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[05:29.200 --> 05:32.400]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[05:32.400 --> 05:34.360]  It's liquid, so it goes right to your body fast.
[05:34.360 --> 05:38.520]  If you take it sublingually under the tongue, oh, how about blasting off of sleep?
[05:38.520 --> 05:39.520]  It's incredible.
[05:39.520 --> 05:41.640]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[05:41.640 --> 05:44.280]  It's so popular we can't keep it in stock.

[06:06.200 --> 06:09.320]  It's Tuesday, March 23rd, 2021.
[06:09.320 --> 06:13.560]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and as we speak, I'm about to arrive at the studio and complete
[06:13.560 --> 06:19.800]  the transmission live, but I'm coming to you from earlier today in the space time continuum
[06:19.800 --> 06:22.320]  as major news and information breaks.
[06:22.320 --> 06:26.360]  We're about to premiere this amazing report that only you can share with others and defeat
[06:26.360 --> 06:27.360]  the globalists.
[06:27.360 --> 06:28.960]  This is seriously a mission.
[06:28.960 --> 06:31.400]  We are seriously on the cutting edge of this fight.
[06:31.400 --> 06:33.480]  So many others claim they're on the cutting edge.
[06:33.480 --> 06:35.400]  Others claim they've got no political answers.
[06:35.400 --> 06:36.920]  Others claim they understand the world really works.
[06:36.920 --> 06:38.320]  I wish they did.
[06:38.320 --> 06:39.720]  We wouldn't be in this trouble.
[06:39.720 --> 06:40.720]  We're under attack.
[06:40.720 --> 06:45.400]  We study the globalist source documents themselves, and we know their program.
[06:45.400 --> 06:46.400]  We know their operation.
[06:46.400 --> 06:50.240]  We know how to defeat this group of control freaks and sociopaths.
[06:50.240 --> 06:51.680]  So the report is at man.video.
[06:51.680 --> 06:53.320]  It's also infowarstore.com.
[06:53.320 --> 06:56.320]  The age of genetically modified humans has arrived.
[06:56.320 --> 07:00.240]  If you're a radio listener, understand you can't see this.
[07:00.240 --> 07:04.400]  Everyone watching and sharing it can see the documents, see the reports, see the quotes
[07:04.400 --> 07:05.400]  themselves.
[07:05.400 --> 07:09.840]  That's why it's so important to get this information, to check it out for yourself and then share
[07:09.840 --> 07:10.840]  it with others.
[07:10.840 --> 07:14.360]  This is a massive criminal genetic takeover of the planet.
[07:14.360 --> 07:16.040]  This is the final revolution.
[07:16.040 --> 07:20.040]  Here is Greg Reese's report at man.video.
[07:20.040 --> 07:26.840]  Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, a think tank started 23 years ago in 1998,
[07:26.840 --> 07:34.240]  has conducted dozens of exercises on simulated pandemics and bioweapons attacks, including
[07:34.240 --> 07:40.640]  Operation Dark Winner in 2001, where one of the main objectives was how to force vaccinate
[07:40.640 --> 07:43.240]  an uncooperative population.
[07:43.240 --> 07:51.440]  The Atlantic Storm in 2005 addressed the logistics of mass vaccinations and military quarantines.
[07:51.440 --> 07:58.280]  Clade X in 2018 pushed for radical fast-tracking of vaccine production.
[07:58.280 --> 08:05.000]  Crimson Contagion was a massive exercise launched in January of 2019.
[08:05.000 --> 08:10.920]  It involved scores of organizations, public and private, from both the federal and state
[08:10.920 --> 08:11.920]  level.
[08:11.920 --> 08:18.160]  Crimson Contagion lasted for over half a year and was based on a severe pandemic that originated
[08:18.160 --> 08:20.240]  in China.
[08:20.240 --> 08:27.120]  In October 18th of 2019, Johns Hopkins partnered with the World Economic Forum and the Bill
[08:27.120 --> 08:34.360]  and Melinda Gates Foundation to sponsor Event 201, a simulation wherein an outbreak of a
[08:34.360 --> 08:39.160]  bat coronavirus kills 65 million people.
[08:39.160 --> 08:44.440]  The culmination of all these studies was published in November of 2019.
[08:44.440 --> 08:49.720]  The CSIS Commission on Strengthening America's Health Security urges the U.S. government
[08:49.720 --> 08:55.440]  to, quote, replace the cycle of crisis and complacency that has long plagued health security
[08:55.440 --> 09:01.960]  preparedness with a doctrine of continuous prevention, protection and resilience.
[09:01.960 --> 09:07.120]  In other words, they are calling for the medical tyranny we are now seeing manifest around
[09:07.120 --> 09:08.600]  us.
[09:08.600 --> 09:15.000]  Designed by former military, big pharma and U.S. representatives, the CSIS document calls
[09:15.000 --> 09:21.760]  for continuous rapid vaccines, while also warning that the vaccines may go wrong and
[09:21.760 --> 09:24.800]  start spreading more disease.
[09:24.800 --> 09:28.400]  And on that subject, what disease are we talking about?
[09:28.400 --> 09:33.920]  After a year of COVID-19, the numbers show us it is no more deadly than the common cold,
[09:33.920 --> 09:40.680]  and even the WHO admit that all the PCR tests from 2020 are meaningless, and they had the
[09:40.680 --> 09:44.880]  vaccine before the mysterious outbreak ever occurred.
[09:44.880 --> 09:50.600]  The agenda is now clearly about endless vaccinations for everyone.
[09:50.600 --> 09:55.920]  New mRNA vaccines that have never gone through human testing until now.
[09:55.920 --> 10:03.560]  The same controversial technology as the CRISPR-TEC, wherein one can easily splice human DNA and
[10:03.560 --> 10:05.920]  permanently modify it.
[10:05.920 --> 10:08.360]  They say the possibilities are endless.
[10:08.360 --> 10:13.760]  So now we can target nearly any sequence in our own genetic code at will.
[10:13.760 --> 10:19.880]  Jennifer Doudna, who won the Nobel Prize for CRISPR, tried calling for a worldwide moratorium
[10:19.880 --> 10:24.240]  on any clinical application of gene editing using CRISPR.
[10:24.240 --> 10:26.000]  But no one seemed to care.
[10:26.000 --> 10:31.120]  Not only does there seem to be zero regulation, but anyone can cheaply buy and learn what
[10:31.120 --> 10:36.720]  they need to online to permanently change the genome in practically any living creature.
[10:36.720 --> 10:41.800]  Just size aner, coming straight to you from my garage lab, and I want to talk to you about
[10:41.800 --> 10:45.360]  how to genetically engineer a human being.
[10:45.360 --> 10:50.240]  The mRNA vaccine is based on CRISPR technology.
[10:50.240 --> 10:56.720]  China recently used CRISPR-TEC to genetically modify babies to be immune to HIV, and as
[10:56.720 --> 11:00.480]  a result, lessened their lifespans.
[11:00.480 --> 11:07.160]  Just like Cesis warned, it all may go wrong, and when it does, big pharma at all is free
[11:07.160 --> 11:09.680]  from any and all liability.
[11:09.680 --> 11:15.600]  The solution will be more gene-altering vaccinations, until they finally get it right.
[11:15.600 --> 11:16.600]  Or not.
[11:16.600 --> 11:22.840]  Eventually, and certainly sooner rather than later, an unaltered natural human body will
[11:22.840 --> 11:25.760]  be considered a biohazard.
[11:25.760 --> 11:31.040]  The full control over the human genome will become the new normal.
[11:31.040 --> 11:36.440]  Without argument, we are now in the era of genetically modified humans, and while millions
[11:36.440 --> 11:42.440]  are gleefully lining up to get their experimental gene-editing jab, others are being tagged
[11:42.440 --> 11:51.320]  like chattel, vaccine passports, vaccine certificates, and freedom bracelets made by the same company
[11:51.320 --> 11:55.800]  that specializes in prison-monitoring bracelets.
[11:55.800 --> 12:02.280]  And now we have a new think tank simulation, the SPARS pandemic, another outbreak, and
[12:02.280 --> 12:08.320]  another vaccine, with warnings of the anti-vaccination movement.
[12:08.320 --> 12:13.760]  And don't forget the Rockefeller Foundation's scenarios for the future of technology and
[12:13.760 --> 12:19.760]  international development, lockstep, wherein they illustrate plans to use pandemics and
[12:19.760 --> 12:26.920]  big pharma to usher in a world of tighter, top-down government control and more authoritarian
[12:26.920 --> 12:28.440]  leadership.
[12:28.440 --> 12:34.800]  Get ready for the next round, because without any opposition, this thing keeps going straight
[12:34.800 --> 12:36.880]  into the abyss.
[12:36.880 --> 12:39.840]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[12:39.840 --> 12:44.400]  Just remember a month ago, the day was where it came out and said, we've done the great
[12:44.400 --> 12:49.520]  reset, not for COVID-19, but to cut carbon, which you were carbon, I am carbon.
[12:49.520 --> 12:56.200]  We're doing this so that we can save the Earth by cutting our output and shutting down human
[12:56.200 --> 13:02.200]  reproduction, humans eating, humans farming, humans doing anything, humans flying in airplanes.
[13:02.200 --> 13:05.760]  Here's the latest article on Infowars.com, Eat the Bugs.
[13:05.760 --> 13:11.720]  World Economic Forum claims bugs are a future and another great reset, PSA.
[13:11.720 --> 13:15.480]  So they had a PSA a month ago saying it's so good we shut the planet down for carbon.
[13:15.480 --> 13:21.080]  We need to have regular carbon shutdowns, carbon, martial law, and now they're back
[13:21.080 --> 13:26.200]  to, you will eat bugs, you will eat synthetic meat, and you will drink sewage, and you will
[13:26.200 --> 13:28.440]  eat water weeds.
[13:28.440 --> 13:32.000]  These are all things they can breed in giant factories, where they don't have to compete
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.120]  with farms and ranches and dairies.
[13:35.120 --> 13:41.480]  They're like, why do they come up with weeds and synthetic meat growing in vats in warehouses,
[13:41.480 --> 13:43.600]  and why do they come up with bugs?
[13:43.600 --> 13:47.040]  Because there's no industries to do that, there's no people doing that.
[13:47.040 --> 13:49.520]  That's got the same carbon footprint, probably higher.
[13:49.520 --> 13:53.760]  It's all about weird stuff they come up with, and then mandate, and then dystopically teach
[13:53.760 --> 13:55.640]  you all this, and it gets worse.
[13:55.640 --> 14:00.280]  Another article on Infowars.com that links the BBC, Reuters, all of it, oh, UK health
[14:00.280 --> 14:05.320]  ministers say that we're never going to end the lockdown, and we're never going to end
[14:05.320 --> 14:06.320]  wearing the mask.
[14:06.320 --> 14:12.120]  And it says, because the public is now habituated, that was always the plan to habituate you
[14:12.120 --> 14:15.480]  to get you to submit, to get you to live in fear.
[14:15.480 --> 14:20.360]  I was at Yale today at Scullin' Bones, the report will be out in a few days.
[14:20.360 --> 14:24.240]  And most of the people were listeners who shook my hands, but a minority of people came over
[14:24.240 --> 14:26.840]  and just said, screw you, I'm not going to believe what you say.
[14:26.840 --> 14:29.480]  That's not Scullin' Bones, that's not a satanic order.
[14:29.480 --> 14:31.000]  Oh, are the frogs gay?
[14:31.000 --> 14:34.520]  Ha, ha, ha, when all the evidences were being sterilized by addressing the water, it's
[14:34.520 --> 14:36.240]  in even the mainstream news.
[14:36.240 --> 14:40.960]  But they couldn't even get out of the fact that they're caught in the system, and that
[14:40.960 --> 14:45.680]  they've given up their life force, and that they are subserving themselves to the system.
[14:45.680 --> 14:47.960]  You can see the deadness of their eyes.
[14:47.960 --> 14:53.000]  Some were black, some were white, but they all looked like a spiritual spider had put
[14:53.000 --> 15:00.160]  mangs into them, or a spiritual mosquito had put a proboscis into them and sucked their
[15:00.160 --> 15:01.840]  very soul out of them.
[15:01.840 --> 15:07.360]  And they were now just giggling, snickering wraiths who were slaves of the system, but
[15:07.360 --> 15:11.200]  just couldn't help it, wearing their mask and pulling them down to custody, and then
[15:11.200 --> 15:15.280]  putting them back up, pulling them down to custody, putting them back up like Marionettes,
[15:15.280 --> 15:17.280]  but a globalist has their hand up in controlling.
[15:17.280 --> 15:19.880]  And I felt sorry for them, I was not their enemy.
[15:19.880 --> 15:24.360]  It's just so sad to see people working for the establishment when it's so corrupt and
[15:24.360 --> 15:28.840]  believing their rebels, because the establishment tells them they're elitist, tells them they're
[15:28.840 --> 15:32.880]  cool, tells them they're smart, they're anointed, they're the liberals, they're the great people
[15:32.880 --> 15:38.040]  as they burn books, as they ban books, as they back-commit as China, and all the incredible
[15:38.040 --> 15:39.040]  enslavement.
[15:39.040 --> 15:40.040]  It's just amazing.
[15:40.040 --> 15:43.160]  So this report needs to be seen, Greg's reports are always powerful.
[15:43.160 --> 15:46.760]  This was particularly important to you, and we worked on it for a whole week, you've got

[18:20.320 --> 18:27.320]  We'll be right back.
[19:09.480 --> 19:14.160]  Now the incredible news is, Project Veritas has done it yet again, they just had a major
[19:14.160 --> 19:18.240]  court ruling where a judge said the New York Times printed lies about them, that they were
[19:18.240 --> 19:22.680]  fake news and that was a known fraud and that the New York Times lied, that was a side
[19:22.680 --> 19:23.880]  issue.
[19:23.880 --> 19:30.800]  They just got internal photos at one of these major facilities in Texas that has thousands
[19:30.800 --> 19:35.760]  and thousands and thousands of people per building, and there's a whole bunch of these
[19:35.760 --> 19:40.240]  different buildings there in way worse quality than they ever were under Obama, and of course
[19:40.240 --> 19:45.440]  Trump completely cleaned it up, got them nice facilities, and let the observers come in,
[19:45.440 --> 19:49.040]  what you're supposed to do by law, they're not letting any observers in, violating federal
[19:49.040 --> 19:55.160]  law, because they're criminals, because they do what they want under UN replacement migration,
[19:55.160 --> 20:01.520]  they are breaking Europe and the United States, the goal is to bring in 600 million foreigners
[20:01.520 --> 20:09.520]  by the year 2050, that's the official UN number, 250 million into France alone by 2035, you
[20:09.520 --> 20:14.520]  cannot make this up, in Europe total they want over 600 million as well, that again never
[20:14.520 --> 20:18.600]  get jobs, are on the government dole, and are controlled by the government that vote
[20:18.600 --> 20:23.160]  for the government, and will riot for the government, so here is the incredible five
[20:23.160 --> 20:27.640]  and a half minute report, it's posted on pollwars.com, we're posting to band.video, they're
[20:27.640 --> 20:31.840]  trying to block this and censor it in shadow manner on Twitter and on Facebook, this should
[20:31.840 --> 20:36.960]  get 50 million views, only got 300 plus thousand views on YouTube, even though it just broke
[20:36.960 --> 20:41.520]  yesterday, the old days would have 10 million views, this needs to be seen, it shows the
[20:41.520 --> 20:48.640]  total fraud of the puppet in chief, the usurper, the scammer, the stooge, that is Joe Biden
[20:48.640 --> 20:53.760]  and his other stooge Kamala Harris, so here is this report, please get it out to everyone
[20:53.760 --> 20:58.480]  you know, and then after this report I should be back live in studio, I'm on my way there
[20:58.480 --> 21:03.720]  right now, and I'm gonna lay out the tragic shooting in Colorado and how they're trying
[21:03.720 --> 21:07.680]  to use that to come up for our guns and how we need to be countering this situation, I've
[21:07.680 --> 21:12.560]  got all the facts, all the information in a game plan to really expose where this culture
[21:12.560 --> 21:16.960]  of evil, where this culture of violence is coming from, and how as a nation and as a
[21:16.960 --> 21:23.000]  world we can heal, and the fact that it was a good police officer that actually helped
[21:23.000 --> 21:27.360]  stop this monster, a good guy with a gun, and how that's the answer to counter this
[21:27.360 --> 21:33.440]  evil growing, we need the right to self-defense now more than ever, so here is Project Veritas'
[21:33.440 --> 21:38.360]  new incredible report, topping even their previous codes, and then we'll be right back
[21:38.360 --> 21:39.360]  on the other side.
[21:39.360 --> 21:42.400]  I'm on the ground in Donna, Texas, if you want to take a look at this facility right
[21:42.400 --> 21:47.720]  here, to your left, that is the Border Patrol tent facility, stands right behind me, just
[21:47.720 --> 21:51.800]  a month ago, customs of Border Patrol agents completed the construction of that facility,
[21:51.800 --> 21:57.400]  it's a 165,000 square foot facility, and we have never seen images inside this facility
[21:57.400 --> 22:02.960]  before, they won't even allow the non-profit lawyers who conduct the actual oversight of
[22:02.960 --> 22:07.840]  these immigration attention centers to go inside, nobody has seen photos inside of this
[22:07.840 --> 22:16.160]  place until now, Project Veritas has obtained never before seen photographs of what it actually
[22:16.160 --> 22:22.120]  looks like inside this facility, shocking images showing people wrapped up in what
[22:22.120 --> 22:29.040]  looks like metal foil, laying on the ground, their faces covered, why won't the administration
[22:29.040 --> 22:32.240]  be honest about this, why won't they show you these images?
[22:32.240 --> 22:39.360]  If you have a man who's telling us to leave, where would the press, they told us it's private
[22:39.360 --> 22:44.760]  property but you know it isn't private property, airspace, we're gonna fly this Cirrus right
[22:44.760 --> 22:50.360]  over the top of the detention center to get a better look, airspace is not private property
[22:50.360 --> 22:55.360]  so we're flying 1,000 feet, there's the facility right there, you can see it, there it is,
[22:55.360 --> 23:02.360]  right over the facility, you can see it, there it is, there it is, there it is, there it
[23:02.360 --> 23:12.360]  is, there it is, there it is, there it is, there it is, now during a recent press conference
[23:12.360 --> 23:16.880]  the press secretary was asked the question why they haven't released these images, even
[23:16.880 --> 23:22.960]  you haven't released any images that you obviously could redact if you wanted to, again we remain
[23:22.960 --> 23:29.440]  committed to sharing with all of you data on the number of kids crossing the, she dodged
[23:29.440 --> 23:33.280]  the question saying quote, and we remain committed to transparency, I don't have an update for
[23:33.280 --> 23:39.120]  you on the timeline, end quote, well press secretary of the White House let Project Veritas
[23:39.120 --> 23:47.280]  do your job for you, just last night we have now obtained these photos inside this facility,
[23:47.280 --> 23:55.280]  now these photos are very very grim, in addition to the photos Project Veritas has also learned
[23:55.280 --> 24:03.320]  that these photographs were taken in the last few days, there are 8 pods with 8 cells in
[24:03.320 --> 24:09.080]  each facility, at any given moment there are an average of 3,000 people in custody inside
[24:09.080 --> 24:16.120]  this detention center, now the pod has 8 cells that are currently holding 600, that's 600
[24:16.120 --> 24:22.200]  unaccompanied juvenile males aged 7 to 17, they are separated by age or physical size
[24:22.200 --> 24:28.040]  depending on the room, 50 of the individuals inside this facility were COVID positive in
[24:28.040 --> 24:33.880]  these cells, there have been multiple sexual assaults inside this facility, normal assaults
[24:33.880 --> 24:38.680]  and daily medical emergencies, this border crisis does not appear to be slowing down,
[24:38.680 --> 24:43.760]  in fact we've just obtained new leaked documents as well from another insider, this one inside
[24:43.760 --> 24:48.160]  the Department of Homeland Security, it says the document was prepared by the U.S. Customs
[24:48.160 --> 24:53.880]  and Border Protection Office of Intelligence, it warns of a potential Central American based
[24:53.880 --> 24:59.000]  caravan coming our way in less than 2 weeks on March 30th, it says quote, in the days
[24:59.000 --> 25:05.280]  leading up to March 30th and should a caravan form, CBP personnel in the region work closely
[25:05.280 --> 25:10.120]  with and maintain constant communication with CBP Customs and Border Patrol, now every
[25:10.120 --> 25:14.360]  car that drives by is beaming at us, a lot of people giving us the middle finger here,
[25:14.360 --> 25:20.120]  a lot of people are not happy that we are filming or we are recording or asking questions
[25:20.120 --> 25:25.120]  about this facility, not only did our DHS, that's Department of Homeland Security Insider
[25:25.120 --> 25:32.080]  leak us these documents, the insider also secretly recorded in a private DHS Q&A session
[25:32.080 --> 25:36.520]  Alejandro Mayorkas commenting on what he thinks is happening at the border and you can hear
[25:36.520 --> 25:40.480]  this quote from Alejandro talking about the new administration making a decision not to
[25:40.480 --> 25:42.640]  expel unaccompanied children.
[25:42.640 --> 25:53.240]  The new administration made a decision not to expel unaccompanied children and we are
[25:53.240 --> 26:03.040]  addressing a significant increase in the encounters with unaccompanied children in between the
[26:03.040 --> 26:06.480]  border patrol van.
[26:06.480 --> 26:11.840]  These are minors aged 7 to 17 inside the van, he is waving at us right now, the people
[26:11.840 --> 26:17.520]  that are being accompanied in this facility according to what Project Veritas has learned
[26:17.520 --> 26:25.120]  between the ages of 7 and 17, males 600 unaccompanied juveniles, as you can see we are on the corner
[26:25.120 --> 26:32.080]  of South International and Rio Grande Street, just south of Donna, Texas, north of the Mexican
[26:32.080 --> 26:35.320]  border, we were just there at the bridge.
[26:35.320 --> 26:40.480]  We really appreciate the brave insider who worked with us on this story, the public
[26:40.480 --> 26:44.360]  has the right to know that we are going to create an army of whistleblowers and insiders,
[26:44.360 --> 26:50.640]  you can reach out to us at Veritas tips, that's V-E-R-I-T-A-S tips at protonmail.com, some
[26:50.640 --> 26:56.520]  extraordinary images here.
[26:56.520 --> 27:02.200]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and
[27:02.200 --> 27:07.520]  full verses that if you're paying attention you know we've done together, but I'll tell
[27:07.520 --> 27:14.280]  you this, the technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy
[27:14.280 --> 27:19.560]  all independent forms of media, they're trying to shutter and silence the human resistance,
[27:19.560 --> 27:25.360]  so now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate,
[27:25.360 --> 27:29.160]  everything you warned your friends and family about is around to be true, so it's now that
[27:29.160 --> 27:34.680]  your credibility is way up, the power structures are to silence those of us that they can't,
[27:34.680 --> 27:42.320]  but it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us, we have the power, but the sun
[27:42.320 --> 27:47.560]  is setting on humanity and setting on free speech, we have to make sure that we fight
[27:47.560 --> 27:52.360]  hard right now to make sure that a long dark night doesn't come, so be the polar bearer
[27:52.360 --> 27:57.440]  as you are.
[27:57.440 --> 28:01.600]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast, hell I've been
[28:01.600 --> 28:05.720]  on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that, but let me tell you,
[28:05.720 --> 28:10.020]  the new world order is breathing down our neck, the big globalist publications are coming
[28:10.020 --> 28:13.840]  after us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down, so please pray to keep
[28:13.840 --> 28:18.160]  info wars on the air and please support the local states you're listening to as well,
[28:18.160 --> 28:24.120]  at the same time go to infowarstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film,
[28:24.120 --> 28:29.000]  get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[28:29.000 --> 28:30.480]  in the face of this thing.
[28:30.480 --> 28:35.360]  I need your help more than ever now, I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't
[28:35.360 --> 28:40.600]  do it if you don't support us, so pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast
[28:40.600 --> 28:45.520]  however you can and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every
[28:45.520 --> 28:50.240]  day at infowarstore.com, whether it's high quality coffee, for supplements or books
[28:50.240 --> 28:56.040]  or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human
[28:56.040 --> 28:57.040]  and pro-god.
[28:57.040 --> 28:58.040]  Thank you so much.
[28:58.040 --> 29:06.040]  Randy Dewright, Randy Dewright, thanks for holding her on the air, go ahead.
[29:06.040 --> 29:12.000]  Yeah, first of all let me say I love your products, I am a granny and for all the senior
[29:12.000 --> 29:16.840]  citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sun
[29:16.840 --> 29:22.400]  spots or age spots as they're lovingly called, but since taking your X2 for the last couple
[29:22.400 --> 29:29.520]  of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually, people think I'm 55 years old and
[29:29.520 --> 29:33.480]  I was already taking your other supplements but I thought, you know, well maybe that's
[29:33.480 --> 29:37.760]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation, but when I started
[29:37.760 --> 29:42.720]  taking it, I mean it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period of time I started
[29:42.720 --> 29:47.760]  noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know,
[29:47.760 --> 29:54.120]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully
[29:54.120 --> 29:59.640]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[29:59.640 --> 30:04.560]  The entire new world order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel
[30:04.560 --> 30:09.280]  weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being
[30:09.280 --> 30:15.120]  made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[30:15.120 --> 30:21.160]  Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[30:21.160 --> 30:25.960]  an entire system and the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're
[30:25.960 --> 30:30.400]  able to see the beauty of the sunset or the beauty of the waves in the ocean or the beauty
[30:30.400 --> 30:34.720]  of your wife or your husband or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty
[30:34.720 --> 30:39.880]  of music, the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic and
[30:39.880 --> 30:43.920]  that itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[30:43.920 --> 30:48.040]  So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things of the
[30:48.040 --> 30:53.880]  system, but worship the things of God because we're made by God and appreciate your consciousness
[30:53.880 --> 31:00.360]  and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[31:00.360 --> 31:29.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:29.160 --> 31:34.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live inside the InfoWars World headquarters here, Owen Shroyer
[31:34.320 --> 31:35.320]  sitting in studio.
[31:35.320 --> 31:38.840]  We're going to go back to Alex Jones here shortly.
[31:38.840 --> 31:45.400]  He's going to be joining us live here shortly as well, but I had to break in and report
[31:45.400 --> 31:50.520]  some of the latest that we know of the Boulder, Colorado shooter.
[31:50.520 --> 31:55.040]  Obviously his name, Ahmad Al-Issa, it's now coming out.
[31:55.040 --> 31:59.160]  He was an Islamic State sympathizer, so an Islamist.
[31:59.160 --> 32:02.400]  He was an immigrant from Syria.
[32:02.400 --> 32:10.200]  He'd been charged with 10 counts of murder and we're also starting to get some information
[32:10.200 --> 32:11.200]  from the family.
[32:11.200 --> 32:14.240]  He was very anti-social.
[32:14.240 --> 32:19.960]  He was, it seems maybe a paranoid schizophrenic.
[32:19.960 --> 32:25.800]  So who knows what kind of pharmaceutical drugs he had been prescribed potentially for those
[32:25.800 --> 32:28.160]  mental problems.
[32:28.160 --> 32:35.200]  And then we also have a lot of his social media activity before it was deleted, before
[32:35.200 --> 32:39.360]  it was deleted, showing that he was an anti-Trumper.
[32:39.360 --> 32:43.200]  He was a leftist, liberal, progressive.
[32:43.200 --> 32:53.560]  He was one of those that pushed the leftist narrative to a T with racism and everything
[32:53.560 --> 32:56.920]  else that they told him, Trump is bad.
[32:56.920 --> 32:59.840]  He would share PBS articles on his social media.
[32:59.840 --> 33:03.120]  He would share Washington Post articles.
[33:03.120 --> 33:13.160]  So the knee-jerk reaction from the liberal left in America to identify this as a white
[33:13.160 --> 33:18.600]  supremist and another white supremist hate crime is falling apart, but that is not even
[33:18.600 --> 33:26.640]  stopping them from erasing their own comments like from CJ Werlemann, who still has this
[33:26.640 --> 33:33.000]  tweet up on his page and he promotes, you donate to his PayPal everywhere.
[33:33.000 --> 33:34.840]  I think it was a white domestic terrorist.
[33:34.840 --> 33:41.320]  So it was a white domestic terrorist, an immigrant from Syria named Ahmad al-Isra.
[33:41.320 --> 33:48.760]  And Twitter had a trend that was their top trend that also identified the shooter as
[33:48.760 --> 33:51.200]  a white extremist.
[33:51.200 --> 33:55.320]  That was a trend forced on Twitter.
[33:55.320 --> 33:59.600]  Of course, all fake news, all disinformation, all misinformation.
[33:59.600 --> 34:03.320]  So this is what we're learning about the shooter.
[34:03.320 --> 34:10.160]  So expect them to twist the narrative away from the individual or his political leanings
[34:10.160 --> 34:14.400]  or anything like that or his heritage, which they love going to when it politically works
[34:14.400 --> 34:15.400]  for them.
[34:15.400 --> 34:19.320]  But now that it's not going to, expect them to switch that off onto something else or
[34:19.320 --> 34:21.760]  just blame the gun.
[34:21.760 --> 34:22.760]  Sometimes it's the white guy.
[34:22.760 --> 34:25.480]  Oh, it wasn't a white guy, then it's the gun.
[34:25.480 --> 34:29.400]  So expect the pretzels in the media to begin, but they can't hide it.
[34:29.400 --> 34:31.160]  They can't hide their hatred anymore.
[34:31.160 --> 34:35.040]  They can't hide their lies anymore, just like they can't hide the disaster, the national
[34:35.040 --> 34:36.520]  emergency at the southern border.
[34:36.520 --> 34:41.960]  So we're going to be updating on this as more information is coming down.
[34:41.960 --> 34:46.840]  Alex Jones is going to be live in studio in 30 minutes.
[34:46.840 --> 34:51.120]  And we're about to go to this John bound report, but I have to remind you, ladies and gentlemen,

[35:39.760 --> 35:42.320]  too late and some of these sell out.
[35:42.320 --> 35:46.520]  It's infowarsstore.com and your support there makes everything we do here possible.
[35:46.520 --> 35:53.640]  Alex Jones is coming up, but first a breaking report from John bound recent events concerning
[35:53.640 --> 35:58.280]  the current version of the president of the United States make the chaos at the border
[35:58.280 --> 36:14.920]  actually seem secondary.
[36:14.920 --> 36:20.360]  Now that Biden's homage to Gerald Ford and Hillary Clinton is begging for deeper analysis,
[36:20.360 --> 36:25.760]  regardless that there was a blanketed media blackout by the leftist media over his fall
[36:25.760 --> 36:32.120]  up the stairs to Air Force One due to what they clumsily described as wind related.
[36:32.120 --> 36:36.520]  There's cautious and then there's the gold medal performance of the Air Force One Olympic
[36:36.520 --> 36:42.560]  event that 78 year old brain surgery survivor Biden, the leader of the dwindling free world
[36:42.560 --> 36:43.560]  pulled off.
[36:43.560 --> 36:49.280]  The White House will obviously fabricate anything to cover up the unrelenting Biden train wreck.
[36:49.280 --> 37:12.480]  Of course, what can you expect from an administration riddled with chronic potheds.
[37:12.480 --> 37:17.560]  And as the international community led by Russia and China throw more logs on the Biden
[37:17.560 --> 37:23.920]  fire blind siding Joe's amateur administration with fire and brimstone.
[37:23.920 --> 37:29.000]  I have to tell you what I'm hearing is very different from what you described.
[37:29.000 --> 37:32.800]  Well I think we thought too well of the United States.
[37:32.800 --> 37:41.840]  We thought that the US side will follow the necessary diplomatic protocols.
[37:41.840 --> 37:55.080]  So for China it was necessary that we make our position clear.
[37:55.080 --> 38:00.800]  So let me say here that in front of the Chinese side the United States does not have the qualification
[38:00.800 --> 38:04.840]  to say that it wants to speak to China from a position of strength.
[38:04.840 --> 38:11.520]  I want to invite Biden to continue this discussion but on condition that we do it live online
[38:11.520 --> 38:15.240]  without any delay in an open, direct discussion.
[38:15.240 --> 38:20.000]  I think it would be interesting while the border is thrown into chaos.
[38:20.000 --> 38:24.880]  Do you agree that Customs and Border Patrol encounter protection encounter more than 100,000
[38:24.880 --> 38:32.520]  individuals in February which was 173% increase from February 2020 just yesterday now?
[38:32.520 --> 38:36.240]  The numbers with respect to February this year are accurate.
[38:36.240 --> 38:41.480]  Can you confirm that Customs and Border Protection's Donna facility was recently at over 700
[38:41.480 --> 38:42.520]  percent capacity?
[38:42.520 --> 38:46.920]  I don't have the precise figure it was certainly over capacity Mr. Ranking Member.
[38:46.920 --> 38:52.000]  You said earlier your testimony that the situation at the border is undoubtedly difficult.
[38:52.000 --> 38:56.280]  Given the tremendous rise in surge of individuals coming to the border, wouldn't it be fair
[38:56.280 --> 38:59.200]  to call it a crisis because that's what your agents are calling it?
[38:59.200 --> 39:03.400]  Mr. Ranking Member, I'm not spending any time on the language that we use.
[39:03.400 --> 39:05.800]  So we've known this is a crisis.
[39:05.800 --> 39:12.480]  But I learned in just the past hour shows that we are now dealing with a humanitarian disaster.
[39:12.480 --> 39:16.960]  What we learned in Midland just in the past hour is two things.
[39:16.960 --> 39:22.800]  One is they have no proven clean running water at the location.
[39:22.800 --> 39:27.160]  They were using well water that the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has informed
[39:27.160 --> 39:30.080]  the federal government has not been proven to be safe.
[39:30.080 --> 39:34.680]  There's no telling what could be in there including the possibility of an arsenic.
[39:34.680 --> 39:40.680]  And then on top of that, more than 10 percent of the migrants at the Midland location have
[39:40.680 --> 39:43.520]  now tested positive for COVID-19.
[39:43.520 --> 39:47.800]  The Biden administration, the president himself, promised to be incredibly transparent.
[39:47.800 --> 39:51.120]  So when can journalists enter these facilities?
[39:51.120 --> 39:52.320]  Why not tomorrow?
[39:52.320 --> 39:58.200]  We are focused on our operations and the needs of the children and at the same time we are
[39:58.200 --> 40:04.200]  working to provide access to those border patrol facilities when we can do so.
[40:04.200 --> 40:09.520]  As known terrorists are detained by an immigration department that can barely enforce anything
[40:09.520 --> 40:13.200]  under Biden's free for all clout and pivot onslaught.
[40:13.200 --> 40:16.840]  People even on the terror watch list, people from Yemen and then Middle East are coming
[40:16.840 --> 40:18.240]  across the border now.
[40:18.240 --> 40:23.600]  So we are really, we really have a time problem here.
[40:23.600 --> 40:28.160]  Leaving Americans to scratch their heads in wonder, did any terrorists actually make it
[40:28.160 --> 40:29.160]  through?
[40:29.160 --> 40:33.720]  This has to be the most miserable administration I've ever witnessed in my lifetime as an
[40:33.720 --> 40:35.040]  American citizen.
[40:35.040 --> 40:40.760]  And if you want a quick look at popular opinion, look no further than the like-dislike ratio
[40:40.760 --> 40:42.640]  on the White House YouTube channel.
[40:42.640 --> 40:45.280]  Mr. Biden, America is furious.
[40:45.280 --> 41:10.120]  John Bown reporting.
[41:10.120 --> 41:13.160]  All these are selling out except for Rainforest.
[41:13.160 --> 41:17.560]  It finally came back into stock, it's amazing, it's 50% off and free shipping.
[41:17.560 --> 41:22.040]  We've got the toothpaste, the mouthwash, the Kaba Chill, the Vaso Beaks, the Alpapower.
[41:22.040 --> 41:32.360]  All of these are bestsellers, 50% off and free shipping at infowarsstore.com or AAA-253-3139
[41:32.360 --> 41:33.360]  and it funds our operation.

[41:39.000 --> 41:43.280]  a whole host of products, the entire Immersed Essentials line is close to selling out more
[41:43.280 --> 41:47.680]  coming in a few months, but despite that, right now ladies and gentlemen, they're all
[41:47.680 --> 41:52.080]  50% off as well with free shipping, just follow the banners at infowarsstore.com to
[41:52.080 --> 41:56.520]  huge savings and it funds the info war, a 360 win.
[41:56.520 --> 41:59.880]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[41:59.880 --> 42:04.200]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[42:04.200 --> 42:08.920]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[42:08.920 --> 42:13.440]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarsstore.com.
[42:13.440 --> 42:18.200]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[42:18.200 --> 42:23.960]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide
[42:23.960 --> 42:29.960]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[42:29.960 --> 42:36.640]  Blood studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[42:36.640 --> 42:41.240]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[42:41.240 --> 42:47.160]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[42:47.160 --> 42:49.840]  facts that pertain to reality.
[42:49.840 --> 42:57.640]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member or yourself at infowarsstore.com.
[42:57.640 --> 43:03.680]  I knew Trump was in battle, I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double talking
[43:03.680 --> 43:06.200]  agents of the enemy.
[43:06.200 --> 43:11.680]  A lot of people just couldn't believe it, they're like oh no, it's 3G chest, 5G chest,
[43:11.680 --> 43:15.640]  he's invincible and I understand why people aren't to believe that because this is scary
[43:15.640 --> 43:16.640]  what's going on.
[43:16.640 --> 43:19.760]  The global government in the New World War and now that people have come to the fact
[43:19.760 --> 43:22.320]  that that's real, they won't somebody to come save them from.
[43:22.320 --> 43:27.080]  Well, Trump sure as hell tried, my gosh look it out prescription drug prices just tripled
[43:27.080 --> 43:30.800]  for quadruple depending on the drug once you buy it and sign that executive order.
[43:30.800 --> 43:35.440]  We pay the most of anybody in the world, that's just one case of hundreds of things that Trump
[43:35.440 --> 43:40.040]  had reversed and now people are going to feel the sting and the pain, the energy cost, everything
[43:40.040 --> 43:44.760]  else but what's really illustrated this is the trial to the Senate where Trump's own
[43:44.760 --> 43:49.400]  lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election and just
[43:49.400 --> 43:55.160]  engaged in all sorts of criminal activity because the fix is in folks, the swamp is deep.
[43:55.160 --> 43:57.440]  He fought it but it's up to us to win it.
[43:57.440 --> 44:02.360]  The people are awakening, they're taking control of their own environment, cell phones are
[44:02.360 --> 44:08.160]  an amazing tool, really they're a super computer that's handheld but big tech, large corporations,
[44:08.160 --> 44:13.040]  hackers, governments, foreign governments, the chai comms especially are using this to
[44:13.040 --> 44:18.120]  steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop
[44:18.120 --> 44:22.960]  up billions of people's data, they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in
[44:22.960 --> 44:24.520]  mass movements.
[44:24.520 --> 44:31.400]  Bringing them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover, in their own
[44:31.400 --> 44:32.400]  words they admit it.
[44:32.400 --> 44:36.400]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more than
[44:36.400 --> 44:40.680]  a decade and now the units have gotten really lightweight, they're faraday cages, they just
[44:40.680 --> 44:45.560]  look like a cloth envelope, they work absolutely great and it just gives you that security
[44:45.560 --> 44:50.680]  to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't
[44:50.680 --> 44:53.320]  want big brother to know what you're up to because it's not their business.
[44:53.320 --> 45:00.480]  Get yours at infowarstore.com today.
[45:00.480 --> 45:08.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[45:08.920 --> 45:23.360]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones 911 here now, we're at King
[45:23.360 --> 45:26.960]  Super's in South Older Table Mesa.
[45:26.960 --> 45:35.360]  We've got injured parties on the ground 911 now people, we don't know if there's a shooter
[45:35.360 --> 45:47.440]  active shooter somewhere could be in the store, he went in the store, oh my God, God we got
[45:47.440 --> 45:57.800]  people down inside King Super's.
[45:57.800 --> 46:06.680]  His name was Eric Talley, a 51 year old father of seven, who was a patriot and who really
[46:06.680 --> 46:11.200]  loved human life and that everybody that knew him said was just an amazing person and he
[46:11.200 --> 46:18.680]  died heroically helping stop some type of insane demonic psycho that went into a King's
[46:18.680 --> 46:23.640]  Super grocery store in Boulder, Colorado and shot and killed 10 people, including this
[46:23.640 --> 46:26.720]  police officer, he's the only name we know right now.
[46:26.720 --> 46:30.800]  So we don't know all the details yet but we have seen the image of the reported suspect
[46:30.800 --> 46:37.640]  being let out and if you look at all the past activity we've seen, it almost always fits
[46:37.640 --> 46:40.720]  into a particular narrative about 90% of the time.
[46:40.720 --> 46:49.640]  As soon as I heard about the shooting last week at the three different massage parlors
[46:49.640 --> 46:55.480]  which is again the sex industry and the women are exploited, it's a terrible thing, I said
[46:55.480 --> 46:59.520]  I bet this is going to be an incel, I bet it's going to be some type of sexually related
[46:59.520 --> 47:05.040]  thing or it's going to be some type of mafia war but I said on there probably an incel,
[47:05.040 --> 47:09.120]  probably somebody mad at the girls.
[47:09.120 --> 47:13.680]  Jack the Ripper was mad at prostitutes in London, he was probably the crown prince of
[47:13.680 --> 47:17.560]  England famously who had syphilis that was insane so a lot of times you see him raffle
[47:17.560 --> 47:22.400]  attacked, it's either gang related obviously or it's a crazy John.
[47:22.400 --> 47:27.120]  But the media said no no no it's white people, there's an epidemic of them killing Asians
[47:27.120 --> 47:31.240]  even though that's one of the lowest statistic numbers out there, it's blacks killing Asians
[47:31.240 --> 47:34.640]  about a hundred to one of you actually look at the statistics and again most blacks aren't
[47:34.640 --> 47:38.360]  doing that, that's just the numbers, that's the fact so the media tries to smoke screen
[47:38.360 --> 47:42.640]  that and now you're seeing the calls to ban semi-automatic rifles, they have the bills
[47:42.640 --> 47:48.280]  introduced but what's really behind all of this, we've lost God as a society and as
[47:48.280 --> 47:53.160]  a culture and crime was going down the last 30 years now it's been going up the last seven
[47:53.160 --> 47:58.720]  or eight and that's because people are taking more drugs, they're getting crazier and I'm
[47:58.720 --> 48:05.280]  not for banning video games but almost all these mass shooters are mad at a woman, they're
[48:05.280 --> 48:12.200]  an incel, they have felt rejected, sometimes the person's gone postal maybe he worked there,
[48:12.200 --> 48:19.520]  we don't know yet, maybe he had a brain tumor like the famous UT Tower shooter, we don't
[48:19.520 --> 48:25.040]  know but the point is there are crazy evil people in this society, in Japan and China
[48:25.040 --> 48:29.120]  where they don't have guns for the general public, all the time you see a little footnote
[48:29.120 --> 48:36.040]  where a man goes into elementary school and stabs 26 students killing 10, I'm just pulling
[48:36.040 --> 48:40.920]  up numbers out of my memory, you'll see cases in China, man stabs 50 plus people killing
[48:40.920 --> 48:46.140]  22, I mean you've seen those headlines, there's been hundreds of those but they don't get
[48:46.140 --> 48:51.960]  any attention, it's just a blurb because it's a knife, we've seen riots in India where
[48:51.960 --> 48:58.040]  men just go crazy in mob psychology at a steel plant and grab hundreds of steel rods and
[48:58.040 --> 49:04.000]  just start raping women in mass, just mass rapes, like we've seen famously in New York
[49:04.000 --> 49:08.480]  at Central Park where people go into mob psychology and they just start raping people, that's
[49:08.480 --> 49:11.840]  what happens in mobs, look at what happens in the capital, a million people show up in
[49:11.840 --> 49:16.880]  DC, a couple hundred thousand of the capital, a few hundred go crazy and do bad things,
[49:16.880 --> 49:21.640]  the madness of mobs, the craziness of mobs is somewhat well known but that's a whole
[49:21.640 --> 49:26.960]  other subject, what we know here is this is a Rosetta Stone that gives us a view into
[49:26.960 --> 49:32.600]  so many things, was he an incel, was he playing shoot-em-up video games, was he on psychotropic
[49:32.600 --> 49:37.680]  drugs because they're almost always most of those things, obsessed with shoot-em-up video
[49:37.680 --> 49:44.920]  games, incel perverts into the occult and of course on psychotropic drugs in almost
[49:44.920 --> 49:49.560]  every case, they're on the psychotropic drugs or methamphetamines of the illegal drug that
[49:49.560 --> 49:52.920]  disconnects you from reality and gets rid of your inhibitions and that's what they say
[49:52.920 --> 49:58.600]  on the inserts of these drugs that can cause a megalomaniac, a mass murderer or commit
[49:58.600 --> 50:04.160]  suicide, in fact it massively increases people's tendency to do that, that's why they put so
[50:04.160 --> 50:08.080]  many of our veterans on psychotrophics and that's why suicide has gone up, so when you
[50:08.080 --> 50:13.160]  got 25 suicides a day and increasing on our veterans, when you've got hundreds and hundreds
[50:13.160 --> 50:17.680]  of suicides a day in the United States, way up during the lockdowns, when you've got tens
[50:17.680 --> 50:21.640]  of millions, over 10 million extra people starved to death last year from the global
[50:21.640 --> 50:24.920]  lockdowns, that's just a little statistic the New York Times, they admitted over 10
[50:24.920 --> 50:31.360]  million extra died, 200 plus million on the verge of dying, like 287 million they're saying,
[50:31.360 --> 50:36.520]  I don't just believe the UN, I have the numbers, I've studied the facts and they're being accurate
[50:36.520 --> 50:43.160]  there and we know this and behavioral psychologists understand this, Stalin said it perfectly,
[50:43.160 --> 50:48.200]  evil genius that he was, one man dies, it's a tragedy, 10,000 dies, it's a statistic and
[50:48.200 --> 50:53.000]  so we're talking about 10 million extra people on top of the 15 million that starve to death
[50:53.000 --> 50:57.840]  each year have starved to death and it's a minor footnote, they go oh yeah, the lockdown
[50:57.840 --> 51:02.320]  killed an extra 10 million people and 280 something million are set to die, but it's
[51:02.320 --> 51:06.880]  just a footnote, but the left can feel all good and say to gun owners, you're the reason
[51:06.880 --> 51:11.320]  that was another mass shooting, really, they have a total gun ban for citizens of Mexico
[51:11.320 --> 51:16.960]  and it's now over 150,000 that have died, kidnapped, murdered, chopped up, shot in just
[51:16.960 --> 51:21.720]  the last decade of Mexico, I was in Cancun last year and there were five or six big
[51:21.720 --> 51:26.720]  mass shootings while I was there, over 20 people killed and it wasn't even on the national
[51:26.720 --> 51:30.440]  news, it was just in law enforcement news, but I had a bodyguard there with me, they
[51:30.440 --> 51:33.680]  were pulling it up, I had hired Mexican armed bodyguard while I was there and they were
[51:33.680 --> 51:38.640]  showing me all the stuff saying Cancun is no longer safe, so I've been back there, two
[51:38.640 --> 51:42.320]  hour flight from Austin or less, so that's where all this is, you understand, there's
[51:42.320 --> 51:47.720]  massive death all over, Apple runs some of the biggest, most oppressive factories in
[51:47.720 --> 51:52.080]  China with Buddhist Christians and Uyghurs and they don't deny it and there's all the
[51:52.080 --> 51:56.280]  drone footage of tens of thousands of men tied up with bags on their heads being sent
[51:56.280 --> 52:03.120]  to be executed, they rape their wives to, quote, breed them out, like long shanks out
[52:03.120 --> 52:07.960]  of Braveheart, they sell their organs and not a damn thing sent by the liberals on the
[52:07.960 --> 52:14.080]  left, oh, but some psycho demon goes into a king's super and shoots and kills 10 people
[52:14.080 --> 52:18.280]  and now all of us are to blame, we gotta turn our guns in, no, that's more of a reason
[52:18.280 --> 52:23.000]  for us to have guns and protect ourselves in the society and again, when I criticize
[52:23.000 --> 52:26.840]  video games people always say, oh, you want to censor our video games, no, I'm for free
[52:26.840 --> 52:30.920]  speech, but I have a right to tell you that video games were developed in Vietnam because
[52:30.920 --> 52:36.120]  the average soldier close up to somebody would not shoot somebody at 20 feet away, wouldn't
[52:36.120 --> 52:41.000]  look him in the eye and kill him and so they began to train with paper targets that popped
[52:41.000 --> 52:45.200]  up that looked like people, then they created simulators that were projected on walls like
[52:45.200 --> 52:50.560]  doom today that came out of an army simulator to then instinctively shoot and they found
[52:50.560 --> 52:55.480]  it up to about 95% that people would kill, so the average person doesn't want to kill
[52:55.480 --> 52:59.840]  somebody up close, they want to shoot him a mile away if they have to and so these are
[52:59.840 --> 53:04.040]  killing simulators, just like a flight simulator is a flight simulator, it's like a boxing
[53:04.040 --> 53:08.380]  simulator is a boxing simulator, just like the dance simulators, you know, you're dancing
[53:08.380 --> 53:13.600]  on your Wii or whatever the systems are today and that teaches you how to dance because
[53:13.600 --> 53:17.880]  you learn the moves from the machine, it's the same thing, it habituates the neural pathways
[53:17.880 --> 53:22.720]  in the brain, this is just science and almost every one of these guys is pissed off in a
[53:22.720 --> 53:28.520]  woman, they're on drugs, illegal or psychotropic and they're into the occult and they're obsessive
[53:28.520 --> 53:32.920]  video games, so we don't know the facts right now but I know this, statistically mass shootings
[53:32.920 --> 53:37.040]  are still very rare, they're still terrible, statistically it's one of the rarest ways
[53:37.040 --> 53:42.040]  to die, the lockdown has caused tens of thousands of suicides but they don't make an issue
[53:42.040 --> 53:45.960]  out of that, it's destroyed children's future has caused massive depression and there's
[53:45.960 --> 53:50.360]  the very same big pharma companies pushing these dangerous vaccines, the gene therapies
[53:50.360 --> 53:53.920]  pushing more and more psychotrophics that are now at record level, something like 30%
[53:53.920 --> 53:59.160]  of women are now on psychotrophics, over 50% of men, we are a drugged out nation and we're
[53:59.160 --> 54:04.680]  dying, our sperm counts are dropping, our cancer rates are exploding, this modern globalist
[54:04.680 --> 54:09.240]  system is killing us and we're going along with it, so we need to heal and come together
[54:09.240 --> 54:13.640]  and not let the media flip on our switch of feeling bad for somebody and getting sad and
[54:13.640 --> 54:18.480]  having guilt that we own guns but then turn the switch off when it's kids in cages and
[54:18.480 --> 54:24.040]  Biden told them to come here, oh kids aren't cages, switch flipped on, show Obama kids
[54:24.040 --> 54:28.800]  in cages, we get mad at Trump, then Biden comes in 10 times worse than Obama, turn switch
[54:28.800 --> 54:34.480]  off, we don't care, this is mindlessness, this is mind control, this is garbage and
[54:34.480 --> 54:39.080]  finally this police officer, they never tell you the names of the cops killed by Black
[54:39.080 --> 54:43.160]  Lives Matter or by Antifa, remember even a few years ago when all the cops were getting
[54:43.160 --> 54:47.080]  killed under Obama and CNN would say, well cops are bad, they need to stop doing bad
[54:47.080 --> 54:51.040]  things, people won't kill them, as if one cop does something bad so a cop a thousand miles
[54:51.040 --> 54:56.840]  away or 500 miles away gets executed, that's sick, so CNN can't have it both ways, either
[54:56.840 --> 55:01.080]  can MSNBC, they can't, say cops to the devil, get rid of the cops or federalize the cops
[55:01.080 --> 55:06.240]  or defund the police but then separately they have bodyguards, they have armed gunmen,
[55:06.240 --> 55:11.160]  they have national guard protection and then separately say, oh this cop's a hero, no,
[55:11.160 --> 55:16.000]  we have to be absolutely logical about all this and see what's happening and realize
[55:16.000 --> 55:19.400]  it's a thing of the heart and the soul and the mind, that's our problem, that's our
[55:19.400 --> 55:24.080]  issue, that's what we've got to fix, it's not guns, it's evil and things in the hearts
[55:24.080 --> 55:46.360]  of minds of men and women that has to be dealt with.
[55:46.360 --> 56:07.040]  That's

[57:50.400 --> 57:55.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:55.040 --> 58:05.560]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones is about to be back on air live posting the
[58:05.560 --> 58:10.040]  Alex Jones show from the info wars world headquarters here in Austin, Texas.
[58:10.040 --> 58:14.840]  Once again, Owen Troyer breaking in here with just some of the latest developing news.
[58:14.840 --> 58:23.640]  Again, the mass shooter in Boulder, Colorado has been identified Ahmad Al-Issa.
[58:23.640 --> 58:32.880]  He was an immigrant from Syria, a Muslim Islamic State sympathizer and he was also an anti-Trump
[58:32.880 --> 58:43.280]  liberal leftist who liked to share the propaganda fake news of the Washington Post and other
[58:43.280 --> 58:46.960]  like publications on his social media.
[58:46.960 --> 58:53.240]  He also would talk about how racist and his homophobic Americans are, how bad Trump is.
[58:53.240 --> 59:02.600]  He was all about as much immigration as possible and so all of this is coming out.
[59:02.600 --> 59:09.280]  He was anti-social, maybe a paranoid schizophrenic, who knows what kind of pharmaceutical drugs
[59:09.280 --> 59:17.120]  he was on to deal with his paranoia, we'll probably never get to know the truth on that.
[59:17.120 --> 59:23.360]  But of course, as usual, it was the left, it was the liberal media that jumped onto the
[59:23.360 --> 59:24.360]  narrative.
[59:24.360 --> 59:28.440]  They were actually foaming at the mouth, hopping up and down, they were so excited.
[59:28.440 --> 59:36.080]  And so I have some examples here of what's going on, Amy Siskind, a verified leftist
[59:36.080 --> 59:38.960]  journalist on Twitter.
[59:38.960 --> 59:40.800]  The shooter was taken into custody.
[59:40.800 --> 59:46.960]  In other words, it's almost certain a white man, again, if he were black or brown, he
[59:46.960 --> 59:48.240]  would have been dead.
[59:48.240 --> 59:51.680]  She has not, as far as I know, deleted these tweets yet.
[59:51.680 --> 59:56.840]  Oh wait, but then she found out that it was Muslim and she changed her tone.
[59:56.840 --> 1:00:00.400]  Now she says, let's mourn the victims, but not glorify the killer with the attention
[1:00:00.400 --> 1:00:02.600]  of having his name widely known.
[1:00:02.600 --> 1:00:06.680]  Oh, so now that he's not a white male, you don't want to know the details.
[1:00:06.680 --> 1:00:11.800]  Mina Harris, again, verified leftist, I deleted a previous tweet about the suspect in the
[1:00:11.800 --> 1:00:12.800]  Boulder shooting.
[1:00:12.800 --> 1:00:17.520]  I made an assumption based on his being taken into custody alive and the fact that the majority
[1:00:17.520 --> 1:00:20.880]  of mass shootings in the U.S. are carried out by white men.
[1:00:20.880 --> 1:00:25.560]  So you were fake news, but you double down on your fake news, even though you deleted
[1:00:25.560 --> 1:00:27.440]  your fake news.
[1:00:27.440 --> 1:00:29.320]  So you were wrong.
[1:00:29.320 --> 1:00:38.480]  Once again, Uzair, this individual, is actually a, he says he debunks misinformation and
[1:00:38.480 --> 1:00:45.800]  fake news for the AFP fact check, but ironically he's fake news himself.
[1:00:45.800 --> 1:00:51.720]  He tweets out, he was only apprehended and not choked or shot to death because he was
[1:00:51.720 --> 1:00:55.200]  not brown, black or Muslim.
[1:00:55.200 --> 1:00:59.320]  But he was Muslim.
[1:00:59.320 --> 1:01:05.560]  He is only a shooter, not a terrorist.
[1:01:05.560 --> 1:01:10.600]  A poor white guy who may have had a bad day or a sex addict killed at least 10 people
[1:01:10.600 --> 1:01:11.600]  in Boulder, he says.
[1:01:11.600 --> 1:01:17.000]  So it was all fake news coming from the guy who tries to debunk fake news.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:20.480]  Not so well, not so good at his job.
[1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:21.480]  Then there's this one.
[1:01:21.480 --> 1:01:22.840]  It doesn't stop.
[1:01:22.840 --> 1:01:29.320]  It doesn't stop Julie Decaro, again, another verified leftist, extremely tired of people's
[1:01:29.320 --> 1:01:36.600]  lives depending on whether a white man with a AR-15 is having a good day or not.
[1:01:36.600 --> 1:01:39.920]  Another verified liberal waves in Hamul Javari.
[1:01:39.920 --> 1:01:48.680]  It's always angry white men, always, except that it wasn't.
[1:01:48.680 --> 1:01:57.440]  Then you had this tweet go completely viral, and again, just before they know any facts.
[1:01:57.440 --> 1:02:02.440]  I'll bet anyone, my salary right now, that the shooter in Boulder is a right-wing MAGA
[1:02:02.440 --> 1:02:04.000]  white male.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:05.880]  This tweet is still up.
[1:02:05.880 --> 1:02:11.600]  And if you go to the tweet, you'll find other liberals saying, oh, I'll agree.
[1:02:11.600 --> 1:02:12.600]  I'll double it.
[1:02:12.600 --> 1:02:13.600]  My salary.
[1:02:13.600 --> 1:02:14.600]  Oh, it's definitely a white male.
[1:02:14.600 --> 1:02:15.600]  Oh, guarantee you he's MAGA.
[1:02:15.600 --> 1:02:23.480]  Oh, this is the, Captain Obvious, oops, oops.
[1:02:23.480 --> 1:02:29.320]  Your anti-white bigotry is showing.
[1:02:29.320 --> 1:02:30.840]  So what does this really show you?
[1:02:30.840 --> 1:02:31.840]  Well, you know what?
[1:02:31.840 --> 1:02:36.320]  It's sad about this mass shooting, and if one individual there would have had a gun,
[1:02:36.320 --> 1:02:37.520]  it could have saved lives.
[1:02:37.520 --> 1:02:41.000]  The liberals will never be honest about that, and they won't even be honest about their
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:42.600]  own racism.
[1:02:42.600 --> 1:02:46.440]  And so once again, a side issue, but it's a major issue.
[1:02:46.440 --> 1:02:47.960]  Liberalism is a mental disorder, folks.
[1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:55.280]  This is outside of this shooter, probably, but I mean, these leftists are really deranged.
[1:02:55.280 --> 1:02:59.040]  Listers ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[1:02:59.040 --> 1:03:01.680]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodine?
[1:03:01.680 --> 1:03:02.680]  Why do you do that?
[1:03:02.680 --> 1:03:06.680]  Because different strokes for different folks, if we're talking to researchers and scientists,
[1:03:06.680 --> 1:03:11.520]  and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep-earth pure crystal iodine, but you should put one
[1:03:11.520 --> 1:03:15.680]  out with deeper crystal iodine and the two other types because some people can't absorb
[1:03:15.680 --> 1:03:16.680]  pure iodine.
[1:03:16.680 --> 1:03:17.680]  Boom, we did it.
[1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:18.680]  It's popular.
[1:03:18.680 --> 1:03:19.680]  It's X3.
[1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:20.680]  Is it better than X2?
[1:03:20.680 --> 1:03:21.680]  You decide.
[1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:22.680]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[1:03:22.680 --> 1:03:28.040]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleep aid,
[1:03:28.040 --> 1:03:29.440]  and that is down and out.
[1:03:29.440 --> 1:03:34.360]  It's super strong, way stronger than knockout, but they don't compete with each other.
[1:03:34.360 --> 1:03:39.160]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas, and it's 40% off out of the gates

[1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:15.800]  Thank you, gentlemen.
[1:04:15.800 --> 1:04:17.800]  Alex Jones is in the building.
[1:04:17.800 --> 1:04:23.720]  He is doing some deep research, getting some intel right now on this situation, and he's
[1:04:23.720 --> 1:04:26.240]  going to be joining us as soon as he can.
[1:04:26.240 --> 1:04:31.520]  Meanwhile, I'll be filling in until he's ready to come in studio and give you the latest
[1:04:31.520 --> 1:04:32.520]  update.
[1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:35.880]  But look, here's the deal.
[1:04:35.880 --> 1:04:39.880]  Mass shootings in this country are really a rare occurrence, and they would be even
[1:04:39.880 --> 1:04:44.120]  more rare if we had citizens with guns stopping them.
[1:04:44.120 --> 1:04:47.200]  But they know the police take at least two minutes to get to the scene, so they know
[1:04:47.200 --> 1:04:52.880]  they can fire off at least a magazine or two full of rounds at innocent people, killing
[1:04:52.880 --> 1:04:59.480]  people, and get away with it because they never get stopped until the cops show up.
[1:04:59.480 --> 1:05:05.480]  One person, one citizen, one good citizen with a gun could have saved lives in that
[1:05:05.480 --> 1:05:08.760]  Colorado grocery store.
[1:05:08.760 --> 1:05:11.960]  And so there's this whole notion like, oh, you just want it to be like the wall, wall,
[1:05:11.960 --> 1:05:15.440]  glass, everybody with a pistol on their head, blah, blah, blah, no, that's not how I want
[1:05:15.440 --> 1:05:16.440]  it.
[1:05:16.440 --> 1:05:19.680]  That's not how I want it at all.
[1:05:19.680 --> 1:05:27.560]  All it took was one crazy guy, one bad guy with a gun to kill 10 people.
[1:05:27.560 --> 1:05:31.320]  All it would have taken was one good guy with a gun in that store to stop it.
[1:05:31.320 --> 1:05:33.320]  Instead, there wasn't one.
[1:05:33.320 --> 1:05:41.000]  There was no armed security, and it took minutes for the police to get there, and he was able
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:43.680]  to kill 10 people.
[1:05:43.680 --> 1:05:44.680]  That's just logic.
[1:05:44.680 --> 1:05:46.080]  That's just common sense.
[1:05:46.080 --> 1:05:52.120]  We figured that out a long time ago in this country, and we had no mass shootings then.
[1:05:52.120 --> 1:05:57.600]  So a mass shooting is still a rare thing.
[1:05:57.600 --> 1:06:02.720]  Here's what's not a rare thing, and here's what is a major problem facing all of us.
[1:06:02.720 --> 1:06:06.200]  Most people listening to this broadcast will probably never be directly impacted by mass
[1:06:06.200 --> 1:06:07.200]  shooting.
[1:06:07.200 --> 1:06:09.560]  Let's pray to God that continues.
[1:06:09.560 --> 1:06:14.280]  But almost everybody listening to this podcast, almost everybody listening to this radio show,
[1:06:14.280 --> 1:06:19.320]  almost everybody watching this right now, is going to be negatively impacted by Democrat
[1:06:19.320 --> 1:06:23.720]  liberal policies, just like everyone in that grocery store was.
[1:06:23.720 --> 1:06:28.960]  That's the real threat, and now the liberal lefties are going so out of control, their
[1:06:28.960 --> 1:06:36.720]  minds are so warped, their minds are so bent, propagandized, they've become dangers to society.
[1:06:36.720 --> 1:06:39.280]  So this individual was a danger to society.
[1:06:39.280 --> 1:06:42.800]  He came in with a gun, he killed people.
[1:06:42.800 --> 1:06:48.160]  Most of these liberals may not have a gun, but they're dangers to society.
[1:06:48.160 --> 1:06:51.200]  Their policies will kill you.
[1:06:51.200 --> 1:06:56.120]  Their policies will kill freedom in the West.
[1:06:56.120 --> 1:07:03.400]  So I just think it's important that we remember we have serious political issues we need to
[1:07:03.400 --> 1:07:06.720]  straighten out.
[1:07:06.720 --> 1:07:12.280]  And just going against the obvious illogic of the left saying, we need to ban guns, that's
[1:07:12.280 --> 1:07:13.280]  the answer to this.
[1:07:13.280 --> 1:07:19.240]  No, that's the problem with this.
[1:07:19.240 --> 1:07:22.040]  See Joe Biden has just made a statement.
[1:07:22.040 --> 1:07:27.080]  By the way, the headline on ABC News, I laughed out loud during the break reading this headline.
[1:07:27.080 --> 1:07:28.080]  I'm not kidding.
[1:07:28.080 --> 1:07:29.920]  This is the headline.
[1:07:29.920 --> 1:07:35.920]  Biden forced to confront second mass shooting in a week amid COVID relief tour, COVID relief
[1:07:35.920 --> 1:07:37.880]  tour.
[1:07:37.880 --> 1:07:44.360]  So he went from the basement to the kitchen and then to his office.
[1:07:44.360 --> 1:07:47.080]  That's Biden's COVID relief tour.
[1:07:47.080 --> 1:07:49.040]  What a joke.
[1:07:49.040 --> 1:07:55.440]  But here's the actual statement from Biden, today I am calling on Congress to enact common
[1:07:55.440 --> 1:07:57.080]  sense gun law reforms.
[1:07:57.080 --> 1:08:03.240]  Here we go again, including requiring background checks already there on all gun sales, banning
[1:08:03.240 --> 1:08:07.040]  assault weapons and assault weapons, they still can't categorize that.
[1:08:07.040 --> 1:08:12.240]  They still can't tell you what an assault weapon is and high capacity magazines.
[1:08:12.240 --> 1:08:14.120]  What is that even?
[1:08:14.120 --> 1:08:15.400]  What's a high capacity magazine?
[1:08:15.400 --> 1:08:21.480]  So it's just all this ambiguity and eliminating immunity for gun manufacturers who knowingly
[1:08:21.480 --> 1:08:26.320]  put weapons of war on our streets.
[1:08:26.320 --> 1:08:32.920]  So if I go out with a Louisville slugger and bash somebody's head in, do you go after the
[1:08:32.920 --> 1:08:33.920]  Louisville slugger?
[1:08:33.920 --> 1:08:36.320]  Do you go after baseball bats?
[1:08:36.320 --> 1:08:37.840]  No, of course not.
[1:08:37.840 --> 1:08:45.640]  There was just a story out of Miami, two youths, oh they call them spring breakers, two spring
[1:08:45.640 --> 1:08:55.200]  breakers, drugged and raped and ended up, the girl ended up dying.
[1:08:55.200 --> 1:09:01.360]  This girl in Miami, spring breakers they called it, they gave her Percocets.
[1:09:01.360 --> 1:09:03.600]  Are you going to go after Percocet?
[1:09:03.600 --> 1:09:05.360]  Should we ban Percocet?
[1:09:05.360 --> 1:09:10.160]  What if it comes out that this mass shooter was on psychotropic drugs, which I think we
[1:09:10.160 --> 1:09:14.760]  could almost guarantee it, we'll never get to know that though.
[1:09:14.760 --> 1:09:19.560]  I doubt they'll release that information.
[1:09:19.560 --> 1:09:27.840]  But again, what was the reality of the situation?
[1:09:27.840 --> 1:09:36.200]  Well, he was the shooter, anti-Trump liberal leftist and now we have all of his social
[1:09:36.200 --> 1:09:40.400]  media posts where he's sharing PBS, he's sharing Washington Post, he's sharing all the anti-Trump
[1:09:40.400 --> 1:09:46.760]  news, saying how America's racist, Islamophobic, blamed the Christchurch shooting on Islamophobia,
[1:09:46.760 --> 1:09:53.040]  ironically then as an Islamist goes out and does a mass shooting.
[1:09:53.040 --> 1:10:00.960]  Ahmad Al-Issa was an Islamic State sympathizer and immigrant from Syria.
[1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:07.360]  Again, a known anti-Trump leftist.
[1:10:07.360 --> 1:10:13.280]  His family said he was anti-social, perhaps paranoid schizophrenic, that's why we ask about
[1:10:13.280 --> 1:10:20.200]  the drugs that he could have potentially been on.
[1:10:20.200 --> 1:10:28.200]  But that doesn't stop all these verified liberal leftists on Twitter from saying he's white.
[1:10:28.200 --> 1:10:35.840]  CJ Werlemann, the suspected gunman in Boulder, Colorado mass shooting is a white guy.
[1:10:35.840 --> 1:10:42.680]  A white domestic terrorist, that was a lie.
[1:10:42.680 --> 1:10:43.680]  Here's some more of them.
[1:10:43.680 --> 1:10:48.120]  Julia DeCaro, extremely tired of people's lives depending on whether a white man with
[1:10:48.120 --> 1:10:52.160]  an AR-15 is having a good day or not, Hamal Javeri weighs in.
[1:10:52.160 --> 1:10:58.960]  It's always an angry white man, always, except it wasn't.
[1:10:58.960 --> 1:11:06.360]  Uzar Hassan Rizvi, a poor white guy who may have had a bad day, killed at least 10 people.
[1:11:06.360 --> 1:11:10.520]  He was only apprehended and not choked or shot to death because he was not brown, black
[1:11:10.520 --> 1:11:19.840]  or Muslim, except he was, and that's Uzar Hassan Rizvi who's a debunker of misinformation
[1:11:19.840 --> 1:11:22.120]  for the AFP fact check.
[1:11:22.120 --> 1:11:23.120]  Isn't that funny?
[1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:25.560]  He's an agent of misinformation, actually.
[1:11:25.560 --> 1:11:32.000]  Mina Harris, I deleted a previous tweet about the suspect being white in the Boulder shooting.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:35.880]  I made an assumption based on his being taken into custody alive and the fact that the majority
[1:11:35.880 --> 1:11:42.680]  of mass shootings in the U.S. are carried out by white men, so still going along with the
[1:11:42.680 --> 1:11:47.480]  lie even after she tells the lie and admits she lied.
[1:11:47.480 --> 1:11:52.640]  Here's Amy Siskind, the shooter is taken into custody.
[1:11:52.640 --> 1:11:58.480]  In other words, it was a white man, again, if he were black or brown, he would be dead.
[1:11:58.480 --> 1:12:03.280]  Oops, well, Amy found out it was a Muslim and now she says, let's not mourn the victims
[1:12:03.280 --> 1:12:08.480]  but glorify the killer with the tension of having his name widely known.
[1:12:08.480 --> 1:12:10.840]  Alex Jones is in studio.
[1:12:10.840 --> 1:12:16.520]  I'd like him to come on air, come on, Alex, stop waiting in the wings.
[1:12:16.520 --> 1:12:19.520]  So here's the deal, folks.
[1:12:19.520 --> 1:12:24.980]  It's time for America to wake up to some serious issues and everything that the left is proposing
[1:12:24.980 --> 1:12:28.680]  as solutions to these issues is just adding to the problem.
[1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:33.120]  One good person with a gun would have stopped and potentially saved lives that day, would
[1:12:33.120 --> 1:12:38.640]  have stopped that shooter and potentially saved lives, one, just one, just one.
[1:12:38.640 --> 1:12:44.240]  And guess what, all the gun legislation, all the anti-gun laws that could be passed by
[1:12:44.240 --> 1:12:50.200]  Democrats would not have stopped that shooter, but one good guy with a gun would have.
[1:12:50.200 --> 1:12:52.920]  That's logic, that's reasoning, that's common sense.
[1:12:52.920 --> 1:12:58.680]  But don't let that get in the way of an agenda, don't let that get in the way of a narrative.
[1:12:58.680 --> 1:13:03.720]  And now all the liberal lefties that claim to be fighting racism jumped the shark and
[1:13:03.720 --> 1:13:08.360]  said, he's a white male, he's a white male, he's probably a Christian, white male and
[1:13:08.360 --> 1:13:11.560]  a Trump supporter, he's MAGA, I'll bet my salary on it.
[1:13:11.560 --> 1:13:17.760]  That's a viral tweet from David Hoffman, said he bet his salary that it was a right-wing
[1:13:17.760 --> 1:13:20.120]  MAGA white male.
[1:13:20.120 --> 1:13:23.040]  You think he'll be relinquishing his salary anytime soon?
[1:13:23.040 --> 1:13:24.040]  No.
[1:13:24.040 --> 1:13:27.400]  What about all the liberals that shared that tweet and said, oh, guarantee you he's white.
[1:13:27.400 --> 1:13:30.280]  Oh, absolutely, he's white, oh, of course he loves Trump.
[1:13:30.280 --> 1:13:38.160]  No, he hated Trump, he was a liberal leftist, he was a Syrian immigrant and he was a Muslim.
[1:13:38.160 --> 1:13:41.880]  Now do I blame any of those groups of people for this shooter?
[1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:43.400]  Absolutely not.
[1:13:43.400 --> 1:13:47.200]  The guy was obviously deranged, probably on psychotropic drugs.
[1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:52.120]  But the point is, the liberals lied about it again because they lie about everything.
[1:13:52.120 --> 1:14:01.560]  Alex Jones coming up next, the word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden.
[1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:06.520]  And now that all the lies are being revealed, what will you do?
[1:14:06.520 --> 1:14:11.200]  We know that millions will do absolutely nothing.
[1:14:11.200 --> 1:14:15.720]  They will do whatever they are told as if obedience is a virtue.
[1:14:15.720 --> 1:14:21.720]  It is the patriot of the world versus everybody else.
[1:14:21.720 --> 1:14:28.440]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States
[1:14:28.440 --> 1:14:34.600]  against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance
[1:14:34.600 --> 1:14:41.080]  to the same, that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation for purpose
[1:14:41.080 --> 1:14:42.080]  of evasion.
[1:14:42.080 --> 1:14:49.080]  And that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can, so help me God.
[1:14:49.080 --> 1:14:55.080]  Infowars.com, BAM.Video.
[1:14:55.080 --> 1:14:59.440]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point, it's very bittersweet.
[1:14:59.440 --> 1:15:02.640]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would, and now we have
[1:15:02.640 --> 1:15:06.000]  a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that, I care about beating the new world order.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:11.200]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[1:15:11.200 --> 1:15:14.400]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us, for a lot of reasons
[1:15:14.400 --> 1:15:18.080]  I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this, we're going to see this through
[1:15:18.080 --> 1:15:21.680]  the end, we're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[1:15:21.680 --> 1:15:25.320]  So please pray for us, and please buy the products, and then infowarsstore.com, they're
[1:15:25.320 --> 1:15:27.880]  great products, plus they fund the operation.

[1:15:30.720 --> 1:15:31.720]  Do they fund freedom?
[1:15:31.720 --> 1:15:33.080]  No, a lot of them don't.
[1:15:33.080 --> 1:15:37.720]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking
[1:15:37.720 --> 1:15:39.560]  up and looking for truth.
[1:15:39.560 --> 1:15:41.200]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[1:15:41.200 --> 1:15:44.600]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[1:15:44.600 --> 1:15:48.080]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.

[1:15:51.520 --> 1:15:55.280]  going to be on the air, and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[1:15:55.280 --> 1:15:59.560]  Alex Jones here with the new Info War Sale, and it is a fantastic sale.

[1:17:16.480 --> 1:17:23.160]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:28.440]  Well, I was on a secret mission in Connecticut.
[1:17:28.440 --> 1:17:33.040]  It was not the Stirling Bones busy yesterday, but that was part of it, but I am back in
[1:17:33.040 --> 1:17:36.640]  Austin, just landed about 30 minutes ago, rushed here to the studio.
[1:17:36.640 --> 1:17:39.040]  Flight was a little bit delayed or I would have been here for the start of the broadcast.
[1:17:39.040 --> 1:17:43.400]  I appreciate Owen Schreuer sitting in during much of the first hour into the second, but
[1:17:43.400 --> 1:17:47.120]  we are now live and I'll be hosting the fourth hour today as well.
[1:17:47.120 --> 1:17:53.280]  And so, coming up next hour, I'm going to open the phones up so you can respond to the
[1:17:53.280 --> 1:17:58.200]  wheels coming off the Obama administration, just absolutely flying off.
[1:17:58.200 --> 1:18:00.760]  And no, that was not a mistake I made on air.
[1:18:00.760 --> 1:18:07.040]  The wheels coming off Obama 2.0 administration with their puppet, Biden.
[1:18:07.040 --> 1:18:10.120]  It is disintegrating way quicker than I thought it even would.
[1:18:10.120 --> 1:18:11.120]  We predicted it would disintegrate.
[1:18:11.120 --> 1:18:17.100]  That was a foregone conclusion, but this is like watching a train wreck in fast motion.
[1:18:17.100 --> 1:18:20.400]  It's not in slow motion.
[1:18:20.400 --> 1:18:21.400]  Totally crazy.
[1:18:21.400 --> 1:18:25.800]  And let's go ahead and play a clip of Biden telling everybody just six months ago, if
[1:18:25.800 --> 1:18:28.440]  I get elected, surge the border.
[1:18:28.440 --> 1:18:32.880]  What I would do as president is several more things, because things have changed.
[1:18:32.880 --> 1:18:38.080]  I would in fact make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[1:18:38.080 --> 1:18:39.960]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[1:18:39.960 --> 1:18:41.120]  They deserve to be heard.
[1:18:41.120 --> 1:18:42.120]  That's who we are.
[1:18:42.120 --> 1:18:45.600]  We're a nation that says if you want to flee and you're fleeing oppression, you should
[1:18:45.600 --> 1:18:47.600]  come.
[1:18:47.600 --> 1:18:50.800]  And if you want to kidnap a kid and bring them along with you, even better.
[1:18:50.800 --> 1:18:55.440]  And so now we have the incredible Project Veritas out of all their exploits, out of
[1:18:55.440 --> 1:18:58.520]  all their bombshells, out of everything they've done.
[1:18:58.520 --> 1:18:59.520]  This is the biggest thing.
[1:18:59.520 --> 1:19:02.600]  I wouldn't say it's the biggest journalistic thing they ever did, even though it's incredible
[1:19:02.600 --> 1:19:07.480]  and a five-star compared to some of the undercover stuff that took years to do, but just getting
[1:19:07.480 --> 1:19:12.680]  the photos they don't want out, flying over the compound, just bringing it out right at
[1:19:12.680 --> 1:19:13.680]  this moment.
[1:19:13.680 --> 1:19:21.960]  The biggest thing Project Veritas has ever done, hands down, incredible.
[1:19:21.960 --> 1:19:29.120]  Just I had tears in my eyes last night watching that and just seeing that.
[1:19:29.120 --> 1:19:34.400]  For the fact that they have told people come here with kidnap children, they've said if
[1:19:34.400 --> 1:19:38.800]  you've got a child under 10, you get in free, so they are literally kidnaping children.
[1:19:38.800 --> 1:19:45.080]  The smugglers are making in Texas alone 14 million more a day off of smuggling people
[1:19:45.080 --> 1:19:46.600]  if they don't pay all the full price.
[1:19:46.600 --> 1:19:47.600]  They kill them.
[1:19:47.600 --> 1:19:51.800]  There are hundreds of thousands of people in unmarked mass graves all over the U.S. border
[1:19:51.800 --> 1:19:57.600]  with Mexico, and it's not ranchers like in machete kills with Don Johnson shooting pregnant
[1:19:57.600 --> 1:20:02.240]  women in the stomach, it's the coyotes that the Democrats think I'm talking about a real
[1:20:02.240 --> 1:20:03.240]  wolf.
[1:20:03.240 --> 1:20:10.440]  No, the smugglers that are doing it, just absolute pure evil as the globalist attempt
[1:20:10.440 --> 1:20:11.440]  to break this country.
[1:20:11.440 --> 1:20:16.720]  We have the video and the photos, migrants, illegal aliens, wave Biden for president flag
[1:20:16.720 --> 1:20:19.320]  while waiting to enter the United States.
[1:20:19.320 --> 1:20:20.600]  Are some of these nice people?
[1:20:20.600 --> 1:20:21.600]  Yes.
[1:20:21.600 --> 1:20:22.600]  Are some of them bad people?
[1:20:22.600 --> 1:20:23.600]  Yes.
[1:20:23.600 --> 1:20:27.760]  But the big overarching issue is they turned the third world off with complete lockdown
[1:20:27.760 --> 1:20:29.560]  for over six months.
[1:20:29.560 --> 1:20:34.160]  Now we're into a year of partial lockdown, the immigrants say we have nothing, there's
[1:20:34.160 --> 1:20:39.560]  no water, there's no food, we have to come here and the UN is there with Joe Biden t-shirts
[1:20:39.560 --> 1:20:44.640]  and with thousand, two thousand, three thousand dollar euro or debit cards with no name on
[1:20:44.640 --> 1:20:49.720]  them, this is in the news, and the people from all over the world.
[1:20:49.720 --> 1:20:53.840]  They're from Asia, they're from Africa, they're from the Middle East, they're from South
[1:20:53.840 --> 1:20:59.400]  America, they're from Central America, they're from Mexico, and they are just pouring across
[1:20:59.400 --> 1:21:00.400]  the UN.
[1:21:00.400 --> 1:21:04.680]  Opens up these migration centers into Europe, they open them up into the United States,
[1:21:04.680 --> 1:21:10.800]  we put Trump in, he stopped it dead, the border patrol stopped it dead and now they're breaking
[1:21:10.800 --> 1:21:17.320]  our border with tens of thousands a day.
[1:21:17.320 --> 1:21:23.800]  And it's a crime when Obama would just release children to smuggler groups, they call them
[1:21:23.800 --> 1:21:28.480]  NGOs, longer middle organizations, and Biden's doing that again, they're only holding people
[1:21:28.480 --> 1:21:33.080]  at these facilities that hold 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 a piece, they've built new ones by
[1:21:33.080 --> 1:21:39.000]  the way, under Trump, they've built a bunch of them to send people back, now they're
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:42.680]  just overflowing with people sleeping on the floor, some cases without even the space
[1:21:42.680 --> 1:21:49.640]  blankets, children are being raped, and Biden says you're not allowed to have cameras inside
[1:21:49.640 --> 1:21:53.160]  even though federal law says you are, and so good people inside that actually care and
[1:21:53.160 --> 1:21:56.640]  have a tough job, well, they leak the information.
[1:21:56.640 --> 1:22:00.760]  After all the nice facilities Trump built with the water fountains in each area, and
[1:22:00.760 --> 1:22:06.200]  they said, oh, you're drinking out of toilets, and AOC went and cried in front of a fence
[1:22:06.200 --> 1:22:11.600]  and a parking lot, well, she's not crying now because she's a monster and an exploiter
[1:22:11.600 --> 1:22:20.080]  for the most powerful, rich, tax-exempt billionaires on the planet, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:22:20.080 --> 1:22:25.240]  Absolutely insane, and look, these people came here illegally, are they in a bad situation?
[1:22:25.240 --> 1:22:35.160]  But they said Trump was a monster for photos of what Biden's boss did, Barack Hussein Obama.
[1:22:35.160 --> 1:22:40.160]  So this is a big overarching issue, our dollars being attacked, our energy sectors are being
[1:22:40.160 --> 1:22:45.720]  turned off, everything we have built as a republic is being dismantled, our culture
[1:22:45.720 --> 1:22:51.800]  is under attack, our children are under attack, our family is under attack, America is not
[1:22:51.800 --> 1:22:56.960]  meant to exist in the New World Order, China with all its evils the model, and then they
[1:22:56.960 --> 1:23:04.840]  bring in millions of Islamists, mainly military age men just like Europe, 80 to 90% major
[1:23:04.840 --> 1:23:10.320]  studies of the men brought into Europe and the US of the quote migrants, they call 25,
[1:23:10.320 --> 1:23:17.680]  30, even 40-year-old men on terror watch list, children, and they sickeningly is leftist
[1:23:17.680 --> 1:23:23.080]  in Germany and Sweden, and all those other countries put them in middle schools and high
[1:23:23.080 --> 1:23:28.840]  schools with young girls who they then rape, and they run PSAs we've shown you telling
[1:23:28.840 --> 1:23:34.680]  14-year-old girls get yourself a 25-year-old Pakistan husband.
[1:23:34.680 --> 1:23:39.080]  German TV advertises pedophilia and tells 14-year-old girls get yourself a Pakistani
[1:23:39.080 --> 1:23:45.120]  husband who is put in school with her in the class, then the government pays to move her
[1:23:45.120 --> 1:23:48.240]  in to an apartment with him.
[1:23:48.240 --> 1:23:53.200]  These are German PSAs, German TV shows I have aired here before, they show the women how
[1:23:53.200 --> 1:24:00.560]  to wear burkas, and that's where we're going when we come back with Ahmed Alisa, look at
[1:24:00.560 --> 1:24:10.640]  this maniac, from Syria, got into the country before Trump blocked it four years ago, totally
[1:24:10.640 --> 1:24:14.200]  mentally ill, of course he's mentally ill, the Daily Beast spends it, oh he's mentally
[1:24:14.200 --> 1:24:19.160]  ill, well of course he's mentally ill, he's an Islamist, and he goes in there and shoots
[1:24:19.160 --> 1:24:22.720]  all those people and they're like, oh white man went in, really according to the coding
[1:24:22.720 --> 1:24:28.280]  and everything, this guy has any Asian blood or African bloods in Asian, so Asian man goes
[1:24:28.280 --> 1:24:32.920]  in and shoots everybody, oh but you're still hearing white male did it over and over again
[1:24:32.920 --> 1:24:36.360]  and they're saying, Biden's saying, we're going to ban all semi-autos, make you turn
[1:24:36.360 --> 1:24:42.840]  them in, and we're going to not just take all your semi-autos and make you turn those
[1:24:42.840 --> 1:24:46.400]  in, all your ammo, and I've got an article I've forgotten left in the conference room
[1:24:46.400 --> 1:24:52.160]  where USA Day says ban all tactical gear, gas mask, body armor, they said, oh it's so
[1:24:52.160 --> 1:24:56.440]  frightening to see American conservatives wearing this, even though Antifa set the stage
[1:24:56.440 --> 1:25:02.800]  for this, but don't forget, Joy Bayhard and Nadler say Antifa doesn't exist, ladies and
[1:25:02.800 --> 1:25:07.440]  gentlemen, and Black Lives Matter never did anything violent either, and the military
[1:25:07.440 --> 1:25:11.320]  is told, say Black Lives Matter is not violent, and if you don't agree you're kicked out of
[1:25:11.320 --> 1:25:15.080]  the military, it's all cult programming, now I've got another article right here, another
[1:25:15.080 --> 1:25:19.360]  one out of USA Day where they're saying if you don't pledge as a company and sign a pledge
[1:25:19.360 --> 1:25:23.400]  that Biden won the election and he's your leader, you can't get contracts with the federal
[1:25:23.400 --> 1:25:29.880]  government, loyalty test, got it all right here, extremists are putting tactical gear
[1:25:29.880 --> 1:25:36.600]  at the forefront, time to ban all the tactical gear, so we'll look at Ahmad Alisa when we
[1:25:36.600 --> 1:25:42.200]  come back, it's been, he's been tied directly to ISIS, that's coming out, but oh he was
[1:25:42.200 --> 1:25:48.920]  mentally ill, he was misunderstood, police identified 21 year old Ahmed Ali Alawai Alisa
[1:25:48.920 --> 1:25:54.800]  as suspect in the Boulder shooting, but he's a white guy and it's not terrible.
[1:25:54.800 --> 1:26:01.760]  As negative as times are right now, and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand
[1:26:01.760 --> 1:26:09.080]  that this is all a test, this experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning.
[1:26:09.080 --> 1:26:14.360]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension so we can decide
[1:26:14.360 --> 1:26:18.640]  where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to, and it really does come
[1:26:18.640 --> 1:26:23.280]  down to that, so as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good
[1:26:23.280 --> 1:26:28.160]  in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness, God is
[1:26:28.160 --> 1:26:34.400]  the author of us having our own will, God is the author of us having free will, and
[1:26:34.400 --> 1:26:39.400]  that free will is a beautiful thing, and when you look at mainstream media in Hollywood
[1:26:39.400 --> 1:26:45.440]  and this whole evil culture in Washington DC and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about
[1:26:45.440 --> 1:26:48.960]  dominating your free will, it's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're
[1:26:48.960 --> 1:27:01.840]  bad because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of
[1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:02.840]  the universe.
[1:27:02.840 --> 1:27:29.520]  I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well maybe that's
[1:27:29.520 --> 1:27:33.840]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation, but when I started
[1:27:33.840 --> 1:27:38.800]  taking it, I mean it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period of time I started
[1:27:38.800 --> 1:27:44.960]  noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know,
[1:27:44.960 --> 1:27:50.200]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully
[1:27:50.200 --> 1:27:54.840]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:27:54.840 --> 1:28:01.720]  The ultimate fluoride free charcoal mouthwash is now available at infowarstore.com and Dr.

[1:29:09.440 --> 1:29:17.640]  What I would do as president is several more things because things have changed.
[1:29:17.640 --> 1:29:22.840]  I would in fact make sure that there is, we immediately served to the border.
[1:29:22.840 --> 1:29:24.720]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[1:29:24.720 --> 1:29:25.720]  They deserve to be heard.
[1:29:25.720 --> 1:29:26.720]  That's who we are.
[1:29:26.720 --> 1:29:30.320]  We're a nation that says if you want to flee and you're fleeing oppression, you should
[1:29:30.320 --> 1:29:31.320]  come.
[1:29:31.320 --> 1:29:34.320]  Do you plan to visit the border?
[1:29:34.320 --> 1:29:42.600]  Not today, but I have before and I'm sure I will again.
[1:29:42.600 --> 1:29:45.320]  It's all part of making fun of the collapse of the country.
[1:29:45.320 --> 1:29:47.560]  It's all part of collapsing the third world.
[1:29:47.560 --> 1:29:51.400]  It's all part of killing over 10 million by starvation just the last year and then just
[1:29:51.400 --> 1:29:55.760]  cackling and laughing as you stole the election and you don't care.
[1:29:55.760 --> 1:29:57.200]  It's the globalists that are controlling you.
[1:29:57.200 --> 1:30:02.960]  Here's another article dealing with this from UNICEF, the UN's own admission when they're
[1:30:02.960 --> 1:30:04.800]  the ones orchestrating the whole thing.
[1:30:04.800 --> 1:30:08.080]  COVID-19, a threat to progress against child marriage.
[1:30:08.080 --> 1:30:14.320]  They estimate that 10 million more girls will be at risk of becoming child brides as a result
[1:30:14.320 --> 1:30:21.000]  of the pandemic as their families sell them off as young as age five in the third world.
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:25.720]  Mass carbation, mass abuse of little girls, but it's okay because I remember they asked
[1:30:25.720 --> 1:30:28.880]  Saki, the press secretary, they said, well, what about all the small businesses that will
[1:30:28.880 --> 1:30:31.600]  never reopen and shut down that are non-essential?
[1:30:31.600 --> 1:30:42.800]  She goes, well, we appointed a woman, she said, to the head of the small business council.
[1:30:42.800 --> 1:30:43.800]  Oh, okay.
[1:30:43.800 --> 1:30:46.920]  So it's like, we're going to torture little girls to death.
[1:30:46.920 --> 1:30:49.880]  We have a woman there that will hold their hand while it happens.
[1:30:49.880 --> 1:30:55.200]  It's like she said a few days ago.
[1:30:55.200 --> 1:30:59.640]  They're like, you know, all these terrible things are happening and the veterans are
[1:30:59.640 --> 1:31:03.920]  still eating rotten food and getting sick and sleeping on the floor in DC, the National
[1:31:03.920 --> 1:31:06.320]  Guard.
[1:31:06.320 --> 1:31:08.720]  They're a veteran of the occupation of DC.
[1:31:08.720 --> 1:31:12.800]  And she says, well, Biden didn't do anything, but he did say he was concerned.
[1:31:12.800 --> 1:31:13.800]  He showed concern.
[1:31:13.800 --> 1:31:18.480]  See, they're teaching you that's what a virtue signal is, like you wear a mask, you're moral
[1:31:18.480 --> 1:31:22.560]  and you're good, even though it's not science, it's a fraud, it's crap to post human world.
[1:31:22.560 --> 1:31:23.560]  It's the same thing.
[1:31:23.560 --> 1:31:26.200]  Oh, you open the borders up, you bring in all these poor people, you exploit them, you
[1:31:26.200 --> 1:31:32.360]  drive down wages, you sell them into sex slavery, but it's okay because you're Joe Biden, you're
[1:31:32.360 --> 1:31:38.400]  Barack Obama, you're Saki, you're Hillary Clinton, you're David Rockefeller's protege,
[1:31:38.400 --> 1:31:41.080]  Bill Gates.
[1:31:41.080 --> 1:31:45.960]  And the public has been trained to be so sheep-like and not even know how the world even works
[1:31:45.960 --> 1:31:50.360]  and just be victims to go around begging for stuff that they're domesticated and it's
[1:31:50.360 --> 1:31:51.360]  hellish.
[1:31:51.360 --> 1:31:58.920]  And then they're bringing in hard, core people, most of the, quote, Middle Eastern immigrants
[1:31:58.920 --> 1:32:03.200]  to the country, the refugees in the U.S., it's over 75% that are men.
[1:32:03.200 --> 1:32:04.200]  Look the numbers up.
[1:32:04.200 --> 1:32:08.640]  In Europe, again, look it up, 85% to 90% are men.
[1:32:08.640 --> 1:32:11.160]  Military age, men.
[1:32:11.160 --> 1:32:20.480]  Yeah, there's this tweet, Amad al-Isa, why refugees and immigrants are good for America
[1:32:20.480 --> 1:32:21.480] ?
[1:32:21.480 --> 1:32:22.480]  Yeah, that's right.
[1:32:22.480 --> 1:32:26.480]  They're brought here, they're taught by the media to hate America, they're taught no borders,
[1:32:26.480 --> 1:32:31.800]  no walls, no USA at all, and it's just the UN contracting with the third world to break
[1:32:31.800 --> 1:32:36.840]  America and bring us to our knees, and the left knows what they're doing, they're sociopaths,
[1:32:36.840 --> 1:32:42.200]  they're carrying it out, and I think it's their right to rule over us.
[1:32:42.200 --> 1:32:46.800]  Orbans come out from Eastern Europe and said it's forbidden to say so in Europe, but this
[1:32:46.800 --> 1:32:48.800]  is organized invasion.
[1:32:48.800 --> 1:32:52.080]  95% of the immigrants are military age men.
[1:32:52.080 --> 1:32:57.120]  Yeah, some of the boatloads come in, they're 95% military age men, hell, some are 100%,
[1:32:57.120 --> 1:33:01.800]  but the numbers we've gotten are 85%, 95%.
[1:33:01.800 --> 1:33:06.200]  It's on, ladies and gentlemen, and when they're on video, they're like, I'm here to rape,
[1:33:06.200 --> 1:33:09.880]  I'm here to kill, I'm here to burn, and they just start burning cities, raping, they have
[1:33:09.880 --> 1:33:13.600]  all the videos of just your driving through France, the middle of a forest, and trees
[1:33:13.600 --> 1:33:17.240]  cut in front of you and the men come and grab the people out and rape the women, and then
[1:33:17.240 --> 1:33:21.480]  upload it to the internet and World Star hip-hop posts, it's like, look at those white bitches
[1:33:21.480 --> 1:33:27.560]  getting raped, and it's like a worldwide solidarity, let's kill white people, let's murder white
[1:33:27.560 --> 1:33:32.880]  women, and the media is like, oh, it's so liberal, so they suppress it on Twitter, Facebook,
[1:33:32.880 --> 1:33:38.560]  all those channels, but then on all of the immigrant channels, it's like insane anti-white
[1:33:38.560 --> 1:33:39.560]  garbage.
[1:33:39.560 --> 1:33:48.960]  So let me tell you where this is gonna end, if Joe Biden tries to take the guns, it's
[1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:54.400]  going to wipe out law enforcement and a lot of military to cause a civil war that'll make
[1:33:54.400 --> 1:34:00.320]  the Vietnamese resistance in Vietnam look tame, and then if they were even successful
[1:34:00.320 --> 1:34:04.640]  to break the back of the country and get most people to do it, it will then create a giant
[1:34:04.640 --> 1:34:09.280]  underground and lawlessness, you'll have such bad police involved, they'll all be corrupt
[1:34:09.280 --> 1:34:11.000]  that you will be worse than Mexico.
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:16.360]  We will be a completely failed state with kidnappings, murders, beheadings, hundreds
[1:34:16.360 --> 1:34:22.480]  of thousands dead every few years, just like we basically are becoming, because a tower
[1:34:22.480 --> 1:34:27.680]  of babble can be ruled by the AI globalist takeover that's killing everybody that wants
[1:34:27.680 --> 1:34:33.640]  to post human world, and yeah, I mean, it was reported decades ago that the Islamists
[1:34:33.640 --> 1:34:37.360]  were grooming hundreds of thousands of little girls, selling them into sex slavery, putting
[1:34:37.360 --> 1:34:40.160]  them on airplanes, flying them out of the UK.
[1:34:40.160 --> 1:34:43.640]  If they got uppity, they would cut them up and sell them at kebab shops.
[1:34:43.640 --> 1:34:47.120]  I remember hearing that, I think it was true, that's admitted.
[1:34:47.120 --> 1:34:51.520]  And the police and everyone are so predatory because the Brits and the Scots and the Irish
[1:34:51.520 --> 1:34:56.280]  are so nice that it's not polite when somebody kidnaps and kills your daughter to criticize
[1:34:56.280 --> 1:34:58.320]  them, they do nothing.
[1:34:58.320 --> 1:35:02.880]  And Tommy Robinson stands up and becomes a hero that gets sent to prison repeatedly.
[1:35:02.880 --> 1:35:05.840]  And then the Muslims are trying to ask them to attack his young daughters, so you notice
[1:35:05.840 --> 1:35:09.760]  he's kind of out of the game now, just because he goes outside his house, he gets arrested.
[1:35:09.760 --> 1:35:17.680]  And the police are there holding the UK underwater, strangling it to death.
[1:35:17.680 --> 1:35:22.280]  Senate report, Washington Post, Obama purposely placed little children with sex traffickers
[1:35:22.280 --> 1:35:24.440]  by the thousands.
[1:35:24.440 --> 1:35:29.320]  So that's who these people are.
[1:35:29.320 --> 1:35:34.200]  And so people ask Jones, how are you doing with the DNC and the same groups that sued
[1:35:34.200 --> 1:35:38.280]  Remington into bankruptcy and the same folks that sued the MRA into bankruptcy?
[1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:39.280]  How have you not done it yet?
[1:35:39.280 --> 1:35:42.760]  How are you holding on?
[1:35:42.760 --> 1:35:47.640]  And it's because you have been supporting us massively.
[1:35:47.640 --> 1:35:54.960]  And it's because we have strategies to be able to continue in the future, no matter what,
[1:35:54.960 --> 1:35:58.480]  with all this going on, but I cannot tell you that information, I'm not going to let
[1:35:58.480 --> 1:36:03.240]  the enemy know what we're up to or what we're doing, but just let me assure you we're going
[1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:06.280]  to break and come back and talk about the Islamist in detail and then open the phones
[1:36:06.280 --> 1:36:08.240]  up and take your calls for the next two hours.
[1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:13.040]  Let me assure you, history is happening now and if you want to beat the globalist, you
[1:36:13.040 --> 1:36:16.400]  need to support us and pray for us to spread the word because we are the damn tip of the
[1:36:16.400 --> 1:36:19.800]  spear, thanks to you, and thanks to the crew, and thanks to everything we've done, and number
[1:36:19.800 --> 1:36:20.960]  one, thanks to God.
[1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:26.560]  Without God, there's nothing with God, everything is possible, but the enemy knows what the
[1:36:26.560 --> 1:36:31.040]  tip of the spear, they know we understand their whole battle plan, and most important,
[1:36:31.040 --> 1:36:35.600]  hard research becomes the mainline research for everybody else, and I'm not going to
[1:36:35.600 --> 1:36:40.880]  name names, but it doesn't matter who you think about, who's out there, I've had these
[1:36:40.880 --> 1:36:46.720]  people personally, every one of them, call me or meet with me and tell me, you're the
[1:36:46.720 --> 1:36:51.680]  tip of the spear, you broke the paradigm, you woke me up, you're my guru, you are,
[1:36:51.680 --> 1:36:52.680]  you did it.
[1:36:52.680 --> 1:36:56.760]  It's not about credit, the enemy knows it, they're coming at us, but I kind of flew
[1:36:56.760 --> 1:37:03.000]  under the radar for a long time, when we had 30, 40 million viewers guaranteed every week,
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:06.920]  bigger than Limbaugh 10 years ago, who are any bigger than Limbaugh 10 years ago, I didn't
[1:37:06.920 --> 1:37:10.360]  make a big deal about it because the left's so arrogant, they always want to think they're
[1:37:10.360 --> 1:37:13.920]  better than everybody, and they're winning, so I let them think they were winning and
[1:37:13.920 --> 1:37:21.160]  never explained how we were devastating them, you were devastating them, devastating them,
[1:37:21.160 --> 1:37:26.640]  but I'll tell you now, I need fuel to finish what we're doing and what we're up to and
[1:37:26.640 --> 1:37:30.040]  what we're building, and I need funds right now, plus we have products you need, so I

[1:39:53.080 --> 1:39:59.680]  The New World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world government, but world government
[1:39:59.680 --> 1:40:06.800]  is only the control grid, now inner members of the cult are told that they are gonna transcend
[1:40:06.800 --> 1:40:12.360]  and become gods and attain immortality, but the price for that is to carry out the orderly
[1:40:12.360 --> 1:40:18.920]  extermination of all carbon-based line forms, that's why they say carbon is bad, they are
[1:40:18.920 --> 1:40:25.520]  rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet, they are playing god, they believe they have
[1:40:25.520 --> 1:40:31.360]  been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology to
[1:40:31.360 --> 1:40:36.880]  carry out this transformation, I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings
[1:40:36.880 --> 1:40:44.760]  of the globalist it's all on record, you have been warned, you have been given the information
[1:40:44.760 --> 1:40:51.120]  to say no to this plan, this is the end of all life on earth as we know it, this is the
[1:40:51.120 --> 1:40:54.440]  alien takeover of earth.
[1:40:54.440 --> 1:41:00.560]  You cannot hide a grand assault, America is about to have its energy cut off, its border
[1:41:00.560 --> 1:41:07.240]  is destroyed, it's dollar brought down to nothing, all of you that have served satan
[1:41:07.240 --> 1:41:12.960]  believe that you are on the right team, you are about to find out how pathetic you are,
[1:41:12.960 --> 1:41:20.840]  so I ask all of you who are awake and who love god, stop living in fear, the enemy is
[1:41:20.840 --> 1:41:29.360]  about to expose itself, the enemy can't help itself, the enemy comes to kill, steal, destroy,
[1:41:29.360 --> 1:41:34.960]  we sit here as good people get upset about that and try to stop it, we should, but once
[1:41:34.960 --> 1:41:40.520]  it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking
[1:41:40.520 --> 1:41:46.840]  us, we just have to point out we tried to stop it, so prepare yourselves America, you
[1:41:46.840 --> 1:41:52.320]  are going under judgment just like all the children that were aborted, this is the truth,
[1:41:52.320 --> 1:41:58.320]  this is the info war, I actually bought this in blocks, UHF frequency, Snowden and others
[1:41:58.320 --> 1:42:03.680]  taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us, not just tracking and recording
[1:42:03.680 --> 1:42:11.320]  our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well, with or without a battery,
[1:42:11.320 --> 1:42:18.400]  now with the info wars privacy pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose, excellent,

[1:42:59.720 --> 1:43:21.720]  today, infowarstore.com, you're listening to the alex jones show today, infowarstore.com,
[1:43:21.720 --> 1:43:32.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show today, infowarstore.com, you're listening to the
[1:43:32.760 --> 1:43:36.520]  phones up on the collapse of the border, the globalist takeover, Joe Biden's
[1:43:37.800 --> 1:43:42.600]  disintegration in front of all our eyes and just the massive censorship.
[1:43:42.600 --> 1:43:45.640]  The only thing allowing this, the cowardice of Congress, the cowardice of the
[1:43:45.640 --> 1:43:49.040]  governors, the fact that we're just so conditioned to being abused by the left
[1:43:49.040 --> 1:43:50.240]  and abused by Hollywood.
[1:43:51.360 --> 1:43:52.440]  We sit here and we take it.
[1:43:53.520 --> 1:44:01.160]  Meanwhile, on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, there were 21 shot for fatally in
[1:44:01.160 --> 1:44:04.600]  weakened violence across the city in Chicago.
[1:44:04.600 --> 1:44:07.000]  Then on Monday, there were 15 shot three fatally.
[1:44:07.800 --> 1:44:11.240]  That's 36 in the last three days shot.
[1:44:12.240 --> 1:44:14.240]  And that's seven dead.
[1:44:16.200 --> 1:44:20.400]  And it's not even summertime in Chicago, thousands and thousands and thousands
[1:44:20.400 --> 1:44:23.160]  up to 4,000 shot a year record number.
[1:44:23.160 --> 1:44:27.120]  There's a 2,000 dead plus in one year, usually it's about a thousand dead.
[1:44:27.120 --> 1:44:32.400]  Oh, but Democrats run all that and it's black on black crime, 90 plus percent of
[1:44:32.400 --> 1:44:34.240]  it, so you don't hear about it.
[1:44:35.840 --> 1:44:40.480]  But oh my goodness, somebody goes in a Walmart or somebody goes in a super
[1:44:40.480 --> 1:44:43.160]  store or somebody goes in there that's crazy.
[1:44:43.760 --> 1:44:48.960]  And it's always a devil worshiper or an incel on Prozac or one of those drugs
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:53.280]  or it's an Islamist, which is the same woman hating crazy inbred cult.
[1:44:53.280 --> 1:44:57.040]  But the headlines were all, oh, a white man, let's roll some of that b-roll, guys.
[1:44:57.040 --> 1:45:00.640]  And I'd also ask, before I got in this morning, maybe Rob Duke can do it,
[1:45:00.640 --> 1:45:02.560]  will somebody slow down the footage for me?
[1:45:02.560 --> 1:45:05.400]  I mean, yeah, yeah, just we can just really get a good look at this guy.
[1:45:05.400 --> 1:45:07.400]  There's some of the enhanced footage right there.
[1:45:07.400 --> 1:45:13.400]  So we can see this individual being let out and everything that basically happened.
[1:45:18.400 --> 1:45:19.400]  Yeah, there he is.
[1:45:19.400 --> 1:45:20.400]  We got the slowed down footage.
[1:45:20.400 --> 1:45:24.400]  And yes, he has white skin, it doesn't matter if he has black skin or brown skin
[1:45:24.400 --> 1:45:28.400]  or whatever skin he has, what he did is wrong and psychotic and evil.
[1:45:28.400 --> 1:45:32.400]  And that's why we have armed people to protect us from it because we're becoming
[1:45:32.400 --> 1:45:34.400]  a mentally ill, sick society.
[1:45:36.400 --> 1:45:39.400]  And even if only a few hundred people get killed a year in mass shootings,
[1:45:39.400 --> 1:45:41.400]  it's still too much.
[1:45:41.400 --> 1:45:44.400]  But what about the mass inoculation deaths we see?
[1:45:44.400 --> 1:45:46.400]  What about all the people dying after inoculation?
[1:45:46.400 --> 1:45:51.400]  They go, well, we don't know it was that.
[1:45:51.400 --> 1:45:53.400]  Sure you died two hours after.
[1:45:53.400 --> 1:45:54.400]  Sure you died a day after.
[1:45:54.400 --> 1:45:57.400]  Sure you were a 36-year-old healthy mom of a nine-year-old that worked at
[1:45:57.400 --> 1:45:59.400]  the doctor's office and you took it and your organs liquefied.
[1:45:59.400 --> 1:46:02.400]  And the doctor said clearly it was autoimmune response.
[1:46:02.400 --> 1:46:04.400]  And so what the literature says, it does that.
[1:46:04.400 --> 1:46:06.400]  We're just not going to have a big freak out about that.
[1:46:06.400 --> 1:46:11.400]  But oh, this, it's going to be spun that he was a mentally ill white man,
[1:46:11.400 --> 1:46:14.400]  not a, quote, Asian Islamist.
[1:46:14.400 --> 1:46:18.400]  And yes, they count Arabs as Asian, even though it's a mix of
[1:46:18.400 --> 1:46:23.400]  Caucasoids, Africans, and Asians.
[1:46:23.400 --> 1:46:26.400]  And I won't even say the scientific name of what's in the
[1:46:26.400 --> 1:46:27.400]  scientific books for Africans.
[1:46:27.400 --> 1:46:28.400]  It's not even a racist term.
[1:46:28.400 --> 1:46:29.400]  You just can't say it.
[1:46:29.400 --> 1:46:31.400]  Everybody thinks science is bad now.
[1:46:31.400 --> 1:46:33.400]  They think science is scary.
[1:46:33.400 --> 1:46:37.400]  But probably you want to, behind the term Caucasian,
[1:46:37.400 --> 1:46:40.400]  all it means is from the Caucasus Mountains.
[1:46:40.400 --> 1:46:46.400]  But this, this is what it's all about, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:46:46.400 --> 1:46:50.400]  is the public so dumbed down, so crazy, so bombarded that they
[1:46:50.400 --> 1:46:53.400]  think words and symbols are all bad.
[1:46:53.400 --> 1:46:56.400]  And I see articles everywhere saying, we're not banning books.
[1:46:56.400 --> 1:46:59.400]  We're retiring hundreds of thousands of books.
[1:46:59.400 --> 1:47:04.400]  As fast as universities can say, we think this is a time-dated
[1:47:04.400 --> 1:47:05.400]  book.
[1:47:05.400 --> 1:47:07.400]  Oh, it's not up to your standards today of your language and
[1:47:07.400 --> 1:47:09.400]  your cult, so it's got to go.
[1:47:09.400 --> 1:47:12.400]  I want to read stuff Julius Caesar wrote.
[1:47:12.400 --> 1:47:14.400]  I want to read stuff Adolf Hitler wrote.
[1:47:14.400 --> 1:47:16.400]  I want to read things Mao Zedong wrote.
[1:47:16.400 --> 1:47:18.400]  Not because I agree with him, but I want to understand who
[1:47:18.400 --> 1:47:20.400]  they were.
[1:47:20.400 --> 1:47:23.400]  And anybody telling you you shouldn't be able to read what
[1:47:23.400 --> 1:47:26.400]  those people wrote is the real tyrant in your day that's
[1:47:26.400 --> 1:47:28.400]  threatening you and your family.
[1:47:28.400 --> 1:47:31.400]  You saw the San Bernardino shooting where the husband and
[1:47:31.400 --> 1:47:33.400]  wife Islamists built the bombs.
[1:47:33.400 --> 1:47:35.400]  The neighbors saw the bombs being built but said, well,
[1:47:35.400 --> 1:47:36.400]  we want to be politically correct.
[1:47:36.400 --> 1:47:38.400]  They're Muslims, so we want to call the police home.
[1:47:38.400 --> 1:47:40.400]  And they go shoot a bunch of people in front of the
[1:47:40.400 --> 1:47:43.400]  Christmas tree at the office party.
[1:47:43.400 --> 1:47:46.400]  And for a year, the Obama administration suppressed the
[1:47:46.400 --> 1:47:51.400]  FBI report that they did it in affiliation with ISIS.
[1:47:51.400 --> 1:47:54.400]  And it happens at the Naval Yard shootings and at the
[1:47:54.400 --> 1:47:56.400]  nightclub shootings.
[1:47:56.400 --> 1:47:58.400]  And it's so many of these shootings that an Islamist
[1:47:58.400 --> 1:48:00.400]  goes in and he screams Allah Akbar.
[1:48:00.400 --> 1:48:02.400]  Remember the guy that ran over everybody in New York screaming
[1:48:02.400 --> 1:48:03.400]  Allah Akbar?
[1:48:03.400 --> 1:48:05.400]  They were having congressional hearings about censoring
[1:48:05.400 --> 1:48:08.400]  infowars that day.
[1:48:08.400 --> 1:48:10.400]  They came back from lunch.
[1:48:10.400 --> 1:48:12.400]  They go, I saw infowars was the top of Twitter today.
[1:48:12.400 --> 1:48:14.400]  They said we saw it too at lunch.
[1:48:14.400 --> 1:48:15.400]  A Congressman Wigley.
[1:48:15.400 --> 1:48:17.400]  I'm not kidding from Illinois.
[1:48:17.400 --> 1:48:19.400]  Congressman Wigley or Quigley?
[1:48:19.400 --> 1:48:21.400]  Congressman Quigley, we're sorry.
[1:48:21.400 --> 1:48:23.400]  We'll have AI soon that blocks that.
[1:48:23.400 --> 1:48:24.400]  It's fake news.
[1:48:24.400 --> 1:48:26.400]  It's not Islamic attack.
[1:48:26.400 --> 1:48:28.400]  He just screamed Allah Akbar.
[1:48:28.400 --> 1:48:29.400]  God is great.
[1:48:29.400 --> 1:48:32.400]  As he ran people over with the truck killing them in DC.
[1:48:32.400 --> 1:48:34.400]  And all the other attacks are also not Islamic as well.
[1:48:34.400 --> 1:48:35.400]  He's been told that.
[1:48:35.400 --> 1:48:38.400]  It's a white male, a white Christian, a conservative.
[1:48:38.400 --> 1:48:39.400]  He did it.
[1:48:39.400 --> 1:48:41.400]  Turn your guns in.
[1:48:41.400 --> 1:48:44.400]  And Joe Biden, I've got the article out here, has pledged to
[1:48:44.400 --> 1:48:47.400]  ban all semi-autos, makes you turn them in and put taxes on
[1:48:47.400 --> 1:48:48.400]  ammo.
[1:48:48.400 --> 1:48:51.400]  And here's USA Today.
[1:48:51.400 --> 1:48:54.400]  Extremists are putting tactical gear at the forefront.
[1:48:54.400 --> 1:48:58.400]  As sales soar, some companies seek distance from the
[1:48:58.400 --> 1:49:00.400]  controversy.
[1:49:00.400 --> 1:49:03.400]  Oh my gosh, some people at the Capitol wore helmets and wore
[1:49:03.400 --> 1:49:06.400]  gear because they see Antifa doing it.
[1:49:06.400 --> 1:49:08.400]  Antifa pledged to come out and attack everybody.
[1:49:08.400 --> 1:49:11.400]  And so because they wear a gas mask or a helmet, they say we
[1:49:11.400 --> 1:49:12.400]  need to ban all of this.
[1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:15.400]  And then Americans, the article say, have never seen this
[1:49:15.400 --> 1:49:16.400]  before.
[1:49:16.400 --> 1:49:19.400]  Only right-wingers would dare, it says, to wear uniforms.
[1:49:19.400 --> 1:49:20.400]  You gotta read the article.
[1:49:20.400 --> 1:49:22.400]  Only Trump people would wear uniforms.
[1:49:22.400 --> 1:49:24.400]  Only they would wear tactical gear.
[1:49:24.400 --> 1:49:29.400]  No, no, Antifa that remember Joy Behar and Nadler say do not
[1:49:29.400 --> 1:49:30.400]  exist.
[1:49:30.400 --> 1:49:32.400]  And it's beginning right now.
[1:49:32.400 --> 1:49:33.400]  It's on infowars.com.
[1:49:33.400 --> 1:49:34.400]  It begins.
[1:49:34.400 --> 1:49:37.400]  Obama calls for gun control after boulder shooting.
[1:49:37.400 --> 1:49:40.400]  But not the fast and furious guns he's shipped by the
[1:49:40.400 --> 1:49:43.400]  millions into Mexico and then to Syria to overthrow that
[1:49:43.400 --> 1:49:46.400]  country and have a civil war that killed 300,000 people.
[1:49:46.400 --> 1:49:48.400]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:49:48.400 --> 1:49:50.400]  He's not talking about the guns he's shipped to Mexico to
[1:49:50.400 --> 1:49:52.400]  their cartels to kill over 100,000.
[1:49:52.400 --> 1:49:55.400]  He's not talking about those guns he's shipped to drug
[1:49:55.400 --> 1:49:57.400]  cartels or to ISIS.
[1:49:57.400 --> 1:50:00.400]  He's talking about you having a gun to protect yourself and
[1:50:00.400 --> 1:50:02.400]  how much they don't like that.
[1:50:02.400 --> 1:50:05.400]  And believe me, it's gonna make us a failed state just like
[1:50:05.400 --> 1:50:07.400]  Mexico, they keep going down this road.
[1:50:07.400 --> 1:50:09.400]  And that's what these lawyers and Democrats want.
[1:50:09.400 --> 1:50:12.400]  They want us a failed state broken down, big mega cities
[1:50:12.400 --> 1:50:14.400]  they control that are police states.
[1:50:14.400 --> 1:50:18.400]  All of us out here in the hinterlands make starve to death.
[1:50:18.400 --> 1:50:21.400]  Our electricity turned off, our coal power plants turned off
[1:50:21.400 --> 1:50:22.400]  that they rule over.
[1:50:22.400 --> 1:50:26.400]  The Hunger Games is a model of what they want to do and what
[1:50:26.400 --> 1:50:29.400]  they want to set up.
[1:50:29.400 --> 1:50:32.400]  So continuing, ladies and gentlemen, police identified
[1:50:32.400 --> 1:50:38.400]  21-year-old Ahmed Ali Alawai, Alisa from Syria,
[1:50:38.400 --> 1:50:43.400]  broader to this country as a teenager by the wonderful
[1:50:43.400 --> 1:50:47.400]  current resident, Barack Hussein Obama.
[1:50:47.400 --> 1:50:49.400]  And yeah, that's the current president's Barack Obama,
[1:50:49.400 --> 1:50:53.400]  not his puppet in chief or his deputy puppet Kamala Harris.
[1:50:53.400 --> 1:50:55.400]  Ahmed Alisa, there he is.
[1:50:55.400 --> 1:51:01.400]  He comes to your country and he kills you because it's liberal.
[1:51:01.400 --> 1:51:03.400]  And the whole media goes into overdrive.
[1:51:03.400 --> 1:51:05.400]  Jack Masubic is a great source of accurate information,
[1:51:05.400 --> 1:51:08.400]  says Biden has been briefed on the Colorado shooting,
[1:51:08.400 --> 1:51:11.400]  had isosympathies per White House official.
[1:51:11.400 --> 1:51:14.400]  And believe me, Jack Masubic has amazing sources,
[1:51:14.400 --> 1:51:16.400]  he wouldn't say it, but it wasn't true.
[1:51:16.400 --> 1:51:20.400]  He's a thousand times more credible than the New York Times.
[1:51:20.400 --> 1:51:23.400]  And he bought it six days ago, they go, oh, he was upset.
[1:51:23.400 --> 1:51:28.400]  Just like the Jack Shack incel in Virginia in Atlanta,
[1:51:28.400 --> 1:51:31.400]  who was mad that he spent his whole paycheck reportedly
[1:51:31.400 --> 1:51:36.400]  getting up to three sexual installments a day.
[1:51:36.400 --> 1:51:38.400]  And of course, I mean, I looked at the guy and I said,
[1:51:38.400 --> 1:51:41.400]  that guy's an incel, can we pull up the admitted shooter
[1:51:41.400 --> 1:51:42.400]  in Atlanta?
[1:51:42.400 --> 1:51:45.400]  I mean, look at these guys, they're all little piggy wimp
[1:51:45.400 --> 1:51:48.400]  guys who hate women, hate society.
[1:51:48.400 --> 1:51:51.400]  So I said last night, I said, I bet it's an incel or
[1:51:51.400 --> 1:51:53.400]  somebody on a bunch of drugs or a mentally ill person.
[1:51:53.400 --> 1:51:55.400]  I should have thought as long as that's the same group,
[1:51:55.400 --> 1:51:59.400]  the same woman hating, you know, crazy control free gas crap.
[1:51:59.400 --> 1:52:02.400]  But now we have the leftist with the face mask and the tyranny
[1:52:02.400 --> 1:52:03.400]  and, you know, all the suppression.
[1:52:03.400 --> 1:52:04.400]  And we have the Democrats.
[1:52:04.400 --> 1:52:07.400]  Yeah, show that beard though, that beard's quite a thing.
[1:52:07.400 --> 1:52:09.400]  You see a beard like that need to run.
[1:52:09.400 --> 1:52:11.400]  Can we shrink that down if we see this full beard?
[1:52:11.400 --> 1:52:12.400]  There you go.
[1:52:12.400 --> 1:52:15.400]  For TV viewers, we're summer casting on radio folks.
[1:52:15.400 --> 1:52:17.400]  We also have the UK says it's official.
[1:52:17.400 --> 1:52:19.400]  The lockdown never ends, the mass never ends.
[1:52:19.400 --> 1:52:22.400]  And it says the people like never leaving their house and
[1:52:22.400 --> 1:52:23.400]  getting a free paycheck.
[1:52:23.400 --> 1:52:25.400]  Do you really think you're going to keep getting paychecks
[1:52:25.400 --> 1:52:26.400]  from the government?
[1:52:26.400 --> 1:52:28.400]  No, you're being set up to be obsolete.
[1:52:28.400 --> 1:52:30.400]  They're already saying you're not essential.
[1:52:30.400 --> 1:52:32.400]  Wow, have you figured it out yet?
[1:52:32.400 --> 1:52:34.400]  They're vertically integrating the economy with their AI
[1:52:34.400 --> 1:52:35.400]  takeover.
[1:52:35.400 --> 1:52:37.400]  And the same thing is being announced in all over the US
[1:52:37.400 --> 1:52:39.400]  places like Oregon are saying, oh, we're always going to
[1:52:39.400 --> 1:52:40.400]  wear face masks.
[1:52:40.400 --> 1:52:44.400]  CDC director US could see a avoidable surge to send it in
[1:52:44.400 --> 1:52:47.400]  Europe if we just keep things locked down.
[1:52:47.400 --> 1:52:50.400]  The surge, the surge, and they count every debt that's
[1:52:50.400 --> 1:52:51.400]  covered.
[1:52:51.400 --> 1:52:52.400]  It's all a fraud.
[1:52:52.400 --> 1:52:53.400]  It's all hysteria.
[1:52:53.400 --> 1:52:55.400]  It's all people getting into how they're safe and they're
[1:52:55.400 --> 1:52:58.400]  good because they're a bunch of idiot sheep going to the
[1:52:58.400 --> 1:52:59.400]  slaughter.
[1:52:59.400 --> 1:53:00.400]  What a dangerous time.
[1:53:00.400 --> 1:53:02.400]  I'm going to talk next hour about how the globalist are
[1:53:02.400 --> 1:53:04.400]  going to collapse and why they're going to run out of
[1:53:04.400 --> 1:53:06.400]  steam and how we've just got to be there, warning people
[1:53:06.400 --> 1:53:09.400]  explaining the more you submit, the worse it gets.
[1:53:09.400 --> 1:53:11.400]  Just remember, the more you submit, the worse it gets.
[1:53:11.400 --> 1:53:14.400]  And someday you'll decide to stop submitting.
[1:53:14.400 --> 1:53:16.400]  That's coming up next hour.
[1:53:16.400 --> 1:53:18.400]  I'm going to give the number out.
[1:53:18.400 --> 1:53:19.400]  877-789-2539.
[1:53:19.400 --> 1:53:20.400]  877-789-ALICE.
[1:53:20.400 --> 1:53:21.400]  877-789-2539.
[1:53:21.400 --> 1:53:22.400]  First-time callers.
[1:53:22.400 --> 1:53:23.400]  Long-time callers.
[1:53:23.400 --> 1:53:24.400]  Agree.
[1:53:24.400 --> 1:53:25.400]  Disagree.
[1:53:25.400 --> 1:53:26.400]  Talk about the economy.
[1:53:26.400 --> 1:53:27.400]  Talk about fighting.
[1:53:27.400 --> 1:53:28.400]  Talk about the Islamist attack.
[1:53:28.400 --> 1:53:29.400]  Talk about the open border.
[1:53:29.400 --> 1:53:30.400]  Talk about the Veritas project.
[1:53:30.400 --> 1:53:31.400]  Incredible footage.
[1:53:31.400 --> 1:53:32.400]  And photos.
[1:53:32.400 --> 1:53:34.400]  Talk about it all because they wish we weren't talking, but
[1:53:34.400 --> 1:53:35.400]  we are.
[1:53:35.400 --> 1:53:36.400]  And we're fighting back.
[1:53:36.400 --> 1:53:38.400]  Alex Jones here with the new info or sale.
[1:53:38.400 --> 1:53:40.400]  And it is a fantastic story.
[1:53:40.400 --> 1:53:41.400]  It's a great story.
[1:53:41.400 --> 1:53:42.400]  It's a great story.
[1:53:42.400 --> 1:53:43.400]  It's a great story.
[1:53:43.400 --> 1:53:44.400]  It's a great story.
[1:53:44.400 --> 1:53:46.400]  It is really, really an incredible story.
[1:53:46.400 --> 1:53:48.400]  And it was not only a true info or sale,
[1:53:48.400 --> 1:53:50.400]  but it is a fantastic sale.
[1:53:50.400 --> 1:53:52.400]  It is many of our best selling products,
[1:53:52.400 --> 1:53:54.400]  but just so happened to also be selling out.
[1:53:54.400 --> 1:53:55.400]  But despite that,
[1:53:55.400 --> 1:53:57.400]  they're 50% off
[1:53:57.400 --> 1:54:00.400]  and free shipping on these select items.
[1:54:00.400 --> 1:54:02.400]  Again, all of these are selling out,
[1:54:02.400 --> 1:54:03.400]  except for Rainforest,
[1:54:03.400 --> 1:54:05.400]  it finally came back in the stock.
[1:54:05.400 --> 1:54:06.400]  It's amazing.
[1:54:06.400 --> 1:54:07.400]  It's 50% off
[1:54:07.400 --> 1:54:08.400]  and free shipping.
[1:54:08.400 --> 1:54:09.400]  We've got the toothpaste,
[1:54:09.400 --> 1:54:10.400]  the mouthwash,
[1:54:10.400 --> 1:54:11.400]  the COVichill,
[1:54:11.400 --> 1:54:12.400]  the Vaso Beats,
[1:54:12.400 --> 1:54:13.400]  the Alpha Power,
[1:54:13.400 --> 1:54:20.480]  at infowarstore.com, or AAA-253-3139, and it funds our operation.
[1:54:20.480 --> 1:54:26.000]  Plus, all of the Immersed Essentials, essential oils, natural deodorants, shampoos, conditioners,
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:30.280]  a whole host of products, the entire Immersed Essentials line is close to selling out more
[1:54:30.280 --> 1:54:34.800]  coming in a few months, but despite that, right now ladies and gentlemen, they're all
[1:54:34.800 --> 1:54:36.960]  50% off as well with free shipping.
[1:54:36.960 --> 1:54:41.160]  Just follow the banners at infowarstore.com to huge savings, and it funds the Info War,
[1:54:41.160 --> 1:54:45.240]  a 360 win.
[1:54:45.240 --> 1:54:49.360]  Throughout history, there have been two basic forms of civilizations, and different mixes
[1:54:49.360 --> 1:54:50.360]  of the two.
[1:54:50.360 --> 1:54:53.400]  One is born of Renaissance, the other is born of Conquest.
[1:54:53.400 --> 1:54:58.920]  One bases its power on having strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture,
[1:54:58.920 --> 1:55:02.440]  and ingenuity, art, and skill, and strength.
[1:55:02.440 --> 1:55:07.680]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above
[1:55:07.680 --> 1:55:08.680]  it.
[1:55:08.680 --> 1:55:14.000]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:16.400]  of total mass high-tech slavery.
[1:55:16.400 --> 1:55:20.520]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[1:55:20.520 --> 1:55:24.320]  They point out one of our evils, so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave
[1:55:24.320 --> 1:55:25.320]  masters.
[1:55:25.320 --> 1:55:29.560]  A global permanent lockdown is here, and it's already causing millions and millions to starve
[1:55:29.560 --> 1:55:30.560]  to death.
[1:55:30.560 --> 1:55:32.760]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[1:55:32.760 --> 1:55:36.360]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England, Annotop General, have come out
[1:55:36.360 --> 1:55:40.680]  and said the coming lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[1:55:40.680 --> 1:55:41.680]  That's the facts.
[1:55:41.680 --> 1:55:47.280]  This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[1:55:47.280 --> 1:55:50.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:55:50.280 --> 1:56:01.320]  All right, we are racking your phone calls up right now to give the number out about
[1:56:01.320 --> 1:56:02.320]  a minute ago.
[1:56:02.320 --> 1:56:05.800]  877-789-2539 on this live.
[1:56:05.800 --> 1:56:07.560]  That's 23rd Tuesday Transmission.
[1:56:07.560 --> 1:56:12.280]  Rob, you just blew me away during the break and said, hey, you know, he had that idea
[1:56:12.280 --> 1:56:13.280]  while we were in Connecticut.
[1:56:13.280 --> 1:56:14.280]  You can hear some stuff.
[1:56:14.280 --> 1:56:16.280]  They go by Scullin' Bones in Connecticut.
[1:56:16.280 --> 1:56:19.280]  We were there on 322.
[1:56:19.280 --> 1:56:20.280]  That's synchronous for you.
[1:56:20.280 --> 1:56:21.280]  That's serendipity.
[1:56:21.280 --> 1:56:22.280]  That is just, that is crazy.
[1:56:22.280 --> 1:56:24.680]  We have not planned that.
[1:56:24.680 --> 1:56:30.480]  That was while we should have a big report out on that for you tomorrow or by Thursday.
[1:56:30.480 --> 1:56:34.800]  We got a big floor interview I did a few weeks ago, but I've still been so busy I've put
[1:56:34.800 --> 1:56:35.800]  it out yet.
[1:56:35.800 --> 1:56:36.800]  Probably be airing that tomorrow.
[1:56:36.800 --> 1:56:38.200]  I'm not going to tell you who it is, but it's a big interview.
[1:56:38.200 --> 1:56:40.760]  There's a lot of stuff coming up on the transmission.
[1:56:40.760 --> 1:56:44.960]  But right now, let me play this John Bound report, because these are so good.
[1:56:44.960 --> 1:56:48.920]  We need to get these out, not just having it banned on video, but to the full millions
[1:56:48.920 --> 1:56:49.920]  of listeners and viewers.
[1:56:49.920 --> 1:56:50.920]  You want to share them.
[1:56:50.920 --> 1:56:51.920]  It's a banned on video.
[1:56:51.920 --> 1:56:53.480]  It's COVID vaccine propaganda rages on.
[1:56:53.480 --> 1:56:59.000]  Pippets of the truth concerning the wave of deaths due to the COVID vaccines, but no
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:04.480]  one dares to deeply dive for fear of social media tyranny and cancel culture.
[1:57:04.480 --> 1:57:08.400]  But you can't cancel a COVID vaccine nightmare that is just beginning.
[1:57:08.400 --> 1:57:13.080]  At least a dozen countries have pulled the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine after a rash of
[1:57:13.080 --> 1:57:16.760]  deaths across Europe related to blood clots.
[1:57:16.760 --> 1:57:23.000]  Denmark has just reported two cases of serious illness and one death as a result of the AstraZeneca
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  vaccination.
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:26.040]  Denmark was the first to do it.
[1:57:26.040 --> 1:57:33.000]  It was followed by Norway and Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Romania, Bulgaria and Thailand.
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:38.160]  All these countries have placed a temporary suspension on the AstraZeneca vaccine.
[1:57:38.160 --> 1:57:43.520]  Then we have countries like Austria, Estonia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Latvia and Italy.
[1:57:43.520 --> 1:57:47.920]  These have suspended a specific batch of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
[1:57:47.920 --> 1:57:54.200]  Spain has delayed using this vaccine to inoculate people between 55 and 65 years of age.
[1:57:54.200 --> 1:57:58.640]  And just before we began this show, we got a flash from Berlin.
[1:57:58.640 --> 1:58:04.120]  Germany has now suspended the use of this shot as a quote-unquote precautionary measure.
[1:58:04.120 --> 1:58:09.640]  More than 17 million people in the U.K. and Europe have now gotten the AstraZeneca vaccine.
[1:58:09.640 --> 1:58:15.040]  The company says a total of 37 people developed blood clots as of last week.
[1:58:15.040 --> 1:58:17.600]  A few of those cases resulted in death.
[1:58:17.600 --> 1:58:21.600]  But the European Union won't back down, as the AP reported.
[1:58:21.600 --> 1:58:27.360]  The European Union's drug regulator insisted that there is no indication the AstraZeneca
[1:58:27.360 --> 1:58:33.000]  vaccine causes blood clots, as governments around the world face the grimace of dilemmas
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:38.800]  push on with a vaccine known to save lives or suspend its use over reports of clotting
[1:58:38.800 --> 1:58:40.480]  in some recipients.
[1:58:40.480 --> 1:58:44.120]  Regardless, the public's patience has worn thin.
[1:58:44.120 --> 1:58:49.680]  Those 15 days to curb COVID have long since passed, and playing Russian roulette isn't
[1:58:49.680 --> 1:58:51.880]  what anyone signed up for.
[1:58:51.880 --> 1:58:55.840]  What can an employer do if their employee does not want to get vaccinated?
[1:58:55.840 --> 1:58:57.880]  Yeah, so they can fire them.
[1:58:57.880 --> 1:59:02.800]  Meanwhile, Biden has announced that he will send a surplus of millions of the dangerous
[1:59:02.800 --> 1:59:05.360]  vaccine to Canada and Mexico.
[1:59:05.360 --> 1:59:09.800]  This is a war, and you are the frontline troops.
[1:59:09.800 --> 1:59:15.160]  President Biden and Vice President Harris praised CDC staffers on the same day the administration
[1:59:15.160 --> 1:59:18.160]  reached a key milestone ahead of schedule.
[1:59:18.160 --> 1:59:23.160]  We just met my goal of administering 100 million shots.
[1:59:23.160 --> 1:59:28.480]  And rather than calm the public's anxiety, fear-mongering takes center stage with warnings
[1:59:28.480 --> 1:59:32.960]  of COVID surges and variants to keep the pandemic healthscape alive.
[1:59:32.960 --> 1:59:37.960]  But the country's top health experts acknowledge the challenges ahead, including an uptick
[1:59:37.960 --> 1:59:41.200]  in new cases, partly due to the new COVID variants.
[1:59:41.200 --> 1:59:47.240]  It has been detected in 50 jurisdictions in the United States, and likely accounts now
[1:59:47.240 --> 1:59:53.120]  for about 20 to 30% of the infections in this country.
[1:59:53.120 --> 1:59:54.720]  And that number is growing.
[1:59:54.720 --> 1:59:56.320]  And if the children of America.
[1:59:56.320 --> 1:59:59.920]  All right, the full report is on infowars.com.
[1:59:59.920 --> 2:00:05.720]  When you hear, that's about a week old news, 37 died from blood clots, how about 37,000?
[2:00:05.720 --> 2:00:09.280]  It's always a small miniscule number that actually get reported.
[2:00:09.280 --> 2:00:14.200]  The numbers of deaths from the mRNA vaccines are just off the charts.
[2:00:14.200 --> 2:00:20.680]  They're distracting off into AstraZeneca and off into some of the other not normal vaccines.
[2:00:20.680 --> 2:00:24.760]  Their virus vector vaccines are still very dangerous away from the gene therapy.
[2:00:24.760 --> 2:00:27.360]  This is a revolution of gene therapy to take over.
[2:00:27.360 --> 2:00:28.760]  And notice, oh, there's new variants.
[2:00:28.760 --> 2:00:29.760]  Oh, it's so scary.
[2:00:29.760 --> 2:00:31.600]  Oh, it's just, it's never going to end.
[2:00:31.600 --> 2:00:32.800]  It's never going to stop.
[2:00:32.800 --> 2:00:33.800]  They're announcing everywhere.
[2:00:33.800 --> 2:00:34.800]  It never ends.
[2:00:34.800 --> 2:00:35.800]  It's over.
[2:00:35.800 --> 2:00:39.360]  And then it comes the force inoculations, the tracking and all these little submissive
[2:00:39.360 --> 2:00:41.040]  sheet that get into it.
[2:00:41.040 --> 2:00:44.000]  You've got to warn everybody, you know, now you've got to explain to them what's
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:45.760]  happening while we still have time.
[2:00:45.760 --> 2:00:47.360]  This is the takedown of the whole world economy.
[2:00:47.360 --> 2:00:52.120]  This is the control demolition of planet Earth.
[2:00:52.120 --> 2:00:57.080]  It's so hard for me when I'm cutting ads to not get overly excited.
[2:00:57.080 --> 2:01:00.120]  People ask me all the time, they go, Joe, you want cocaine or you want meth?
[2:01:00.120 --> 2:01:01.120]  How are you so excited?
[2:01:01.120 --> 2:01:04.480]  How do I not get excited about world government?
[2:01:04.480 --> 2:01:10.200]  Force masks, force inoculations, open announcements that our country is going to be dissolved.
[2:01:10.200 --> 2:01:11.200]  I'm sorry.
[2:01:11.200 --> 2:01:12.200]  I'm a fighter.
[2:01:12.200 --> 2:01:15.320]  And I know many of you out there watching and listening are fighters as well.
[2:01:15.320 --> 2:01:17.360]  And so I'll just say this.
[2:01:17.360 --> 2:01:18.360]  I try to be calm.
[2:01:18.360 --> 2:01:19.360]  I try to be focused.
[2:01:19.360 --> 2:01:24.840]  I don't know what I do if I wasn't still on air right now, but I just really want to
[2:01:24.840 --> 2:01:29.760]  thank you for keeping us on air because you have to realize when I tell you that you're
[2:01:29.760 --> 2:01:32.600]  the informer, that's not me patting on the head.
[2:01:32.600 --> 2:01:36.280]  You are 99% of the equation.
[2:01:36.280 --> 2:01:40.480]  So when you decide to spread the word, when you decide to buy the products, informerstore.com,
[2:01:40.480 --> 2:01:44.080]  when you decide to share the articles and videos we produce, it changes the world.
[2:01:44.080 --> 2:01:46.400]  So you are the info war.
[2:01:46.400 --> 2:01:48.000]  Thank you so much for the fight.
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:49.000]  Thank you for all you've done.
[2:01:49.000 --> 2:02:02.600]  Now let's take action together and take down the globalist.
[2:02:02.600 --> 2:02:17.640]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[2:02:17.640 --> 2:02:22.800]  When you see the incredible abuse that third world populations and countries under authoritarianism
[2:02:22.800 --> 2:02:26.960]  put up with, it's hard to believe because we were in a free country compared to those
[2:02:26.960 --> 2:02:27.960]  nations.
[2:02:27.960 --> 2:02:28.960]  We had a much better record.
[2:02:28.960 --> 2:02:34.880]  Now, the bottom has fallen out of the culture.
[2:02:34.880 --> 2:02:39.960]  And now you've got a super corrupt decadent media, a super corrupt decadent legal system,
[2:02:39.960 --> 2:02:45.160]  a super corrupt decadent bureaucracy, and then a lot of the public that, again, is watching
[2:02:45.160 --> 2:02:51.880]  five hours of Netflix a day whose children are watching even more TV or internet, and
[2:02:51.880 --> 2:02:54.600]  people are just checked out.
[2:02:54.600 --> 2:02:59.360]  We're in a trance state, but behind the scenes, the globalists and big tech of the genetic
[2:02:59.360 --> 2:03:05.920]  engineers are just rolling out, oh, we've got synthetic embryos and we're growing them
[2:03:05.920 --> 2:03:08.000]  up inside cows and harvesting their organs.
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:09.440]  Yeah, they're not human.
[2:03:09.440 --> 2:03:11.760]  They're just close to human.
[2:03:11.760 --> 2:03:14.560]  Told you decades ago that was already happening.
[2:03:14.560 --> 2:03:22.560]  And as we by increment get to the point where we don't stand up for ourselves and stand up
[2:03:22.560 --> 2:03:30.640]  for others and have a territorialistic attitude about defending humanity, well, then we're
[2:03:30.640 --> 2:03:33.880]  now prey animals.
[2:03:33.880 --> 2:03:41.400]  And so, many an authoritarian has given a speech, many authoritarian has written a note
[2:03:41.400 --> 2:03:45.680]  or a book saying that the essence of a tyranny is getting women on your side.
[2:03:45.680 --> 2:03:49.640]  It's not that women are bad, women are half our species, they're great.
[2:03:49.640 --> 2:03:57.160]  But that's why 80% of advertising targets women, is because if you get the women on
[2:03:57.160 --> 2:04:00.960]  your side, you get everything on your side.
[2:04:00.960 --> 2:04:04.680]  Women make most of the purchases, women make most of the household decisions because they're
[2:04:04.680 --> 2:04:07.280]  the ones that are interested in the nest and they care.
[2:04:07.280 --> 2:04:11.920]  And when they see an outside group come in and say surrender, we're going to kill everybody,
[2:04:11.920 --> 2:04:15.160]  most women roll over and submit.
[2:04:15.160 --> 2:04:21.400]  That's why you study African slave trade, Roman slave trade, Babylonian slave trade,
[2:04:21.400 --> 2:04:27.240]  Chinese slave trade, Japanese, any of the slavery that's happened.
[2:04:27.240 --> 2:04:34.880]  When you went and took over a people, you would kill the men down to about age 12.
[2:04:34.880 --> 2:04:39.920]  And it was a really warlike group, the Romans would kill Germans and Visigoths down to about
[2:04:39.920 --> 2:04:40.920]  age nine.
[2:04:40.920 --> 2:04:46.760]  I've read the official letters of Caesar and they would just take them and kill them.
[2:04:46.760 --> 2:04:52.400]  And the women would instantly just get on their knees and say, whatever you need, just
[2:04:52.400 --> 2:04:55.080]  don't kill our young sons.
[2:04:55.080 --> 2:05:00.440]  And they'd say, well, you tell your young son that he better put in good labor for us
[2:05:00.440 --> 2:05:03.560]  and do good work as our servant or he's dead.
[2:05:03.560 --> 2:05:08.480]  And if one of your sons is bad, we'll kill half your sons.
[2:05:08.480 --> 2:05:11.360]  And if two of your sons is bad, we'll kill all of your sons.
[2:05:11.360 --> 2:05:15.040]  I mean, all this stuff we see unfolding has been done before.
[2:05:15.040 --> 2:05:20.880]  I remember, I don't know, it was Thomas Sowell or Walter Williams, it was one of those great
[2:05:20.880 --> 2:05:27.400]  black American philosophers that I remember on Rush Limbaugh like 23 years ago, something
[2:05:27.400 --> 2:05:28.400]  like that.
[2:05:28.400 --> 2:05:32.200]  Reading, and I only found one article about it in his footnotes and I found one mention
[2:05:32.200 --> 2:05:35.720]  of it in the book later confirming it in the history book that was written over 100 years
[2:05:35.720 --> 2:05:36.720]  ago.
[2:05:36.720 --> 2:05:37.720]  So I know it was true.
[2:05:37.720 --> 2:05:49.320]  And he was reading a French translation from Latin from 2000 years ago in the time of Caesar.
[2:05:49.320 --> 2:05:53.120]  And it was how, when they came and took over, I already read this in history books, I know
[2:05:53.120 --> 2:05:57.560]  it was true, but I didn't know these parts, how when they would come and take over a village
[2:05:57.560 --> 2:06:04.640]  in what is Sweden today or Germany or France, France was Gaul or whether it was, you know,
[2:06:04.640 --> 2:06:08.960]  the Austria Gauss that were in Austria, you know, the Visigoths, which you get the word,
[2:06:08.960 --> 2:06:13.080]  you know, the Vandals, because when they would come in, they'd blow everything up and burn
[2:06:13.080 --> 2:06:16.080]  it down.
[2:06:16.080 --> 2:06:23.760]  And he described how the French, with their transatlantic slave trade buying black slaves
[2:06:23.760 --> 2:06:31.720]  from blacks, we ran slavery just like we did there, that they would put mainly men on the
[2:06:31.720 --> 2:06:40.680]  coffin ships, but they put some women and some children, but about 80% men.
[2:06:40.680 --> 2:06:43.120]  And then they would drive across the ocean.
[2:06:43.120 --> 2:06:47.520]  And normally, I mean, back then it was so bad that usually about 20% of your crew died
[2:06:47.520 --> 2:06:50.120]  going into Africa that they try to stay offshore.
[2:06:50.120 --> 2:06:51.120]  They thought it was vapors.
[2:06:51.120 --> 2:06:54.600]  They know it was mosquitoes biting it would give you fevers and malaria and things.
[2:06:54.600 --> 2:06:57.240]  So you'll read about how they try to get their ships like a mile off.
[2:06:57.240 --> 2:06:59.600]  They thought vapors couldn't get out a mile or so.
[2:06:59.600 --> 2:07:04.360]  It was really a mosquitoes, great history books on this, but a lot of times large, sometimes
[2:07:04.360 --> 2:07:05.360]  whole crews would die.
[2:07:05.360 --> 2:07:08.400]  So it was really bad, but they would put the blacks down in the hole.
[2:07:08.400 --> 2:07:09.400]  They didn't want them to die.
[2:07:09.400 --> 2:07:11.480]  It was product.
[2:07:11.480 --> 2:07:12.960]  And then they would come across it.
[2:07:12.960 --> 2:07:16.040]  Sharks would follow it because they didn't really feed them a lot.
[2:07:16.040 --> 2:07:20.240]  Sharks would follow them because the crew would mutiny if you gave the food to the blacks
[2:07:20.240 --> 2:07:21.440]  because they were starving to death.
[2:07:21.440 --> 2:07:26.320]  They'd usually been pressed, pressing means slavery, grabbed off some farm in England
[2:07:26.320 --> 2:07:30.880]  or France or the Netherlands, the lowlands as they were called, oppressed gang.
[2:07:30.880 --> 2:07:34.760]  Look up a type of the history of press gangs, not like media.
[2:07:34.760 --> 2:07:39.120]  They would hit you on the head, again, usually below 13 because they knew older men would
[2:07:39.120 --> 2:07:40.120]  fight back.
[2:07:40.120 --> 2:07:41.120]  And you'd wake up.
[2:07:41.120 --> 2:07:42.120]  The Chinese have a name for it.
[2:07:42.120 --> 2:07:48.360]  It's called being Shanghai, where they grab Americans in San Francisco or LA, hit us on
[2:07:48.360 --> 2:07:51.360]  the head and take us to China, and you'd wake up on a slow boat to China.
[2:07:51.360 --> 2:07:52.360]  What are you going to do?
[2:07:52.360 --> 2:07:53.360]  You're not out on the boat.
[2:07:53.360 --> 2:07:57.040]  And he's just kidnapped you, so everybody does it.
[2:07:57.040 --> 2:07:58.040]  The boobies really are one of the oldest groups doing it.
[2:07:58.040 --> 2:07:59.040]  That doesn't mean a woman's press.
[2:07:59.040 --> 2:08:03.040]  That's the name of the pirates, the Chinese pirates that were all over Southeast Asia called
[2:08:03.040 --> 2:08:04.040]  the boobies.
[2:08:04.040 --> 2:08:06.480]  See, the history is really interesting, but I'm going to take your calls here the next
[2:08:06.480 --> 2:08:07.480]  segment.
[2:08:07.480 --> 2:08:09.120]  I thought I'd digress.
[2:08:09.120 --> 2:08:16.680]  And they described there in this Latin translation out of Roman, I guess, to Latin, basically
[2:08:16.680 --> 2:08:21.160]  the same thing, into French, exactly how to do it.
[2:08:21.160 --> 2:08:29.320]  So the ship would pull up, and you'd usually have around a third of the people die.
[2:08:29.320 --> 2:08:33.040]  And the women they found were more hearty, some were the children, and you'd think men
[2:08:33.040 --> 2:08:34.640]  are more hearty, but they're not for disease and things.
[2:08:34.640 --> 2:08:37.680]  And then they'd get the women off, and they'd ask why they could speak the local dialect
[2:08:37.680 --> 2:08:43.200]  to them, and they'd explain to them, if you don't do what we say, we're going to do this.
[2:08:43.200 --> 2:08:46.560]  They'd take a couple of the black men, and they'd hang them or cut their heads off right
[2:08:46.560 --> 2:08:47.560]  there.
[2:08:47.560 --> 2:08:51.880]  And then they'd tell the women, you keep things in line, or we're going to kill your
[2:08:51.880 --> 2:08:53.360]  children and the men.
[2:08:53.360 --> 2:08:56.760]  So they only brought some women and children when they wanted pure labors.
[2:08:56.760 --> 2:09:02.480]  The Romans wanted to kill all the men, just bring boys and girls and women to be slaves.
[2:09:02.480 --> 2:09:05.840]  That was how, because these were domestic slaves, mainly not farming slaves.
[2:09:05.840 --> 2:09:09.320]  But if you wanted like a tractor, like a human to be your tractor or your mule, you didn't
[2:09:09.320 --> 2:09:10.320]  want women.
[2:09:10.320 --> 2:09:14.200]  And you didn't want children, but you brought some so the men wouldn't rebel or you'd
[2:09:14.200 --> 2:09:20.360]  kill the women and children, but you'd tell the women, which becomes the house servant,
[2:09:20.360 --> 2:09:23.840]  and you see this today with Oprah Winfrey, he's literally the house slave, keeping control
[2:09:23.840 --> 2:09:24.840]  of the blacks.
[2:09:24.840 --> 2:09:25.840]  And she knows it, by the way.
[2:09:25.840 --> 2:09:28.840]  She goes to eugenics things, hates blacks, wants to carry out their extermination, she's
[2:09:28.840 --> 2:09:31.240]  a monster creature.
[2:09:31.240 --> 2:09:35.520]  And so the house slaves were then produced by the black women being told, if you don't
[2:09:35.520 --> 2:09:38.400]  do this, we're going to kill your children and your men.
[2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:40.560]  And they'd kill some right in front of them.
[2:09:40.560 --> 2:09:43.160]  Then they'd get them up and sell them on the block.
[2:09:43.160 --> 2:09:46.320]  And I remember reading that essay about that and knowing it was accurate, I've read other
[2:09:46.320 --> 2:09:49.600]  history books that you'll mention different parts of it, but it was just so interesting
[2:09:49.600 --> 2:09:53.240]  to watch modern feminism and what it is and just, and how it works.
[2:09:53.240 --> 2:09:54.920]  I mean, I was at Yale.
[2:09:54.920 --> 2:09:59.040]  70% of the students were women, which is the national average, about 70% of the people
[2:09:59.040 --> 2:10:00.360]  in college now are women.
[2:10:00.360 --> 2:10:04.000]  They were all very like, we're in charge, we're taking over, yeah, right.
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:09.800]  And the men all look completely effeminate and like their soul had been sucked.
[2:10:09.800 --> 2:10:10.800]  They could be black.
[2:10:10.800 --> 2:10:11.800]  They could be white.
[2:10:11.800 --> 2:10:18.840]  They all looked like they were on female hormones or something because they were all super skinny,
[2:10:18.840 --> 2:10:23.680]  but they all had female breasts and they were all cackling and acting like you'd imagine
[2:10:23.680 --> 2:10:27.800]  women acting, but the silly way, like a, like a, like a 10-year-old girl would act if she
[2:10:27.800 --> 2:10:31.120]  didn't like you, calling us names, doing things, yelling at us.
[2:10:31.120 --> 2:10:33.200]  A lot of folks who shook our hands were listeners.
[2:10:33.200 --> 2:10:35.360]  They were the few that looked normal.
[2:10:35.360 --> 2:10:38.000]  Some were black, some were white, some were old, some were young.
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:40.160]  But you could just see the spirit on them.
[2:10:40.160 --> 2:10:45.840]  Their very cells were dying and here they were in this big Gothic temple, in this big
[2:10:45.840 --> 2:10:49.840]  temple of death right there that set up the CIA and all of this.
[2:10:49.840 --> 2:10:54.120]  And here it is killing them and they're defending it, even though they don't even know what
[2:10:54.120 --> 2:10:56.160]  is inside of it.
[2:10:56.160 --> 2:10:58.640]  But the guys, can we type in Impressment?
[2:10:58.640 --> 2:10:59.640]  They're called Press Gangs.
[2:10:59.640 --> 2:11:02.920]  It's called Naval Impressment, Impressment.
[2:11:02.920 --> 2:11:06.160]  We want to show people how I do it on my phone.
[2:11:06.160 --> 2:11:09.560]  I got 45 seconds, but I can do it, watch this.
[2:11:09.560 --> 2:11:17.760]  Naval Impressment, Naval Impressment, there it is, Impressment, Colloquial, the Press,
[2:11:17.760 --> 2:11:22.400]  so the Press Gang is the taking of men into the military naval force by compulsion or
[2:11:22.400 --> 2:11:23.400]  without any notice.
[2:11:23.400 --> 2:11:27.360]  European natives of several nations were used to be forced and again, you'd be kidnapped
[2:11:27.360 --> 2:11:28.360]  taking on their ships.
[2:11:28.360 --> 2:11:29.360]  I just thought I'd show you that.
[2:11:29.360 --> 2:11:30.360]  I'm just making this up.
[2:11:30.360 --> 2:11:34.160]  So, we're going to shift gears into your phone calls with the takedown of the US, how to
[2:11:34.160 --> 2:11:38.760]  fight back what we do, how we say no, does there any hope and yes, there will be hope.
[2:11:38.760 --> 2:11:44.040]  I'll explain it in my view, I promise, in just a few minutes on the other side, infowars.com,
[2:11:44.040 --> 2:11:51.320]  newswars.com, and van.video, tomorrow's news, today.
[2:11:51.320 --> 2:11:57.440]  My enemies are your enemies, they're the globalists, they're an extremist, they're a consortium
[2:11:57.440 --> 2:12:02.880]  of bad scientists, pedophiles, control freaks, devil worshipers, vampires, wherever you want
[2:12:02.880 --> 2:12:09.760]  to call them, that are highly predatory, and are setting up a false famously land system
[2:12:09.760 --> 2:12:16.760]  of constant bombardment of propaganda, drugs, and electromagnetic radiation to change the
[2:12:16.760 --> 2:12:23.480]  very DNA of the human species, to mutate us into a form that they can control like a pawn
[2:12:23.480 --> 2:12:24.480]  on a chessboard.
[2:12:24.480 --> 2:12:30.120]  The bottom line is they want to play God, and they are playing God, and the news is
[2:12:30.120 --> 2:12:33.720]  only going to tighten around our necks from year on out, and so many other people want
[2:12:33.720 --> 2:12:38.040]  to be positive, they want to put out fake news, and want to only cover limited amounts
[2:12:38.040 --> 2:12:41.240]  of what's happening with new world order, but at the end of the day, it's all about
[2:12:41.240 --> 2:12:45.640]  the population, it's all about world government, it's all about the end of the human system
[2:12:45.640 --> 2:12:49.600]  as we know it, and on its ashes, a nightmare being built, only admitting it can turn around
[2:12:49.600 --> 2:12:50.600]  and stop it.

[2:14:43.040 --> 2:14:56.240]  All right, I want to go to your phone calls.
[2:14:56.240 --> 2:14:59.040]  Everybody's calling in on every subject you can imagine, Biden collapsing, incredible
[2:14:59.040 --> 2:15:02.800]  project Veritas footage showing the total lives and hypocrisy of the media trying to
[2:15:02.800 --> 2:15:07.040]  cover it up, things that Trump didn't even do one millionth of.
[2:15:07.040 --> 2:15:12.080]  We have got this Islamist connected to ISIS that's coming out, knowing and doing this
[2:15:12.080 --> 2:15:18.120]  massacre probably because he's mad about bombings in Syria and the media is trying to cover
[2:15:18.120 --> 2:15:19.120]  that up.
[2:15:19.120 --> 2:15:20.120]  It's just crazy.
[2:15:20.120 --> 2:15:25.920]  The wheels have come off the Biden administration, but I wanted to talk about some positive things.
[2:15:25.920 --> 2:15:29.440]  The globalists have burned themselves out.
[2:15:29.440 --> 2:15:34.920]  The globalists are people that's sold out to evil and corruption and the more extreme
[2:15:34.920 --> 2:15:42.080]  they get, the more extreme they get, the more extreme they get, and the more ridiculous
[2:15:42.080 --> 2:15:48.680]  the echo chambers they live in become, where they then think red-blooded, decent, hard-working
[2:15:48.680 --> 2:15:54.080]  people are the enemy because the force behind them needs to move us out of the way because
[2:15:54.080 --> 2:15:58.960]  that force wants to do horrible things to them, not just us.
[2:15:58.960 --> 2:16:06.320]  That really is the entire spectrum, is that no one is a winner that serves this evil destiny.
[2:16:06.320 --> 2:16:09.920]  No one is the winner that goes along with this new world order.
[2:16:09.920 --> 2:16:15.880]  We saw Trump, who wasn't perfect, I'm not perfect either of you, but God sent a beachhead
[2:16:15.880 --> 2:16:20.960]  against the Chai comms, against the new world order, against the structure of our country.
[2:16:20.960 --> 2:16:24.640]  Trump forcing the enemy out in the open, and you and I forcing the enemy out in the open
[2:16:24.640 --> 2:16:29.080]  but in making them steal the election and making them flood the borders and have illegals
[2:16:29.080 --> 2:16:34.440]  waving Joe Biden flags, the video and photos from UnimpleWars.com, thousands of people wearing
[2:16:34.440 --> 2:16:40.160]  Joe Biden t-shirts, then Biden saying, surge, come, come, and then breaking our border for
[2:16:40.160 --> 2:16:42.520]  the UN.
[2:16:42.520 --> 2:16:46.480]  As bad as all that is, that was going to be done when Hillary got in, but instead we
[2:16:46.480 --> 2:16:51.520]  saw somebody that tried to stop it and successfully did secure the border to a great extent.
[2:16:51.520 --> 2:16:56.840]  I mean, apprehensions were down over 90% by the end, because they were up 300, 400% at
[2:16:56.840 --> 2:16:59.120]  first, people stopped coming.
[2:16:59.120 --> 2:17:02.560]  They sure as hell stopped smuggling kids.
[2:17:02.560 --> 2:17:05.000]  That is one of Trump's greatest solutions, you know, they said, oh, you didn't build
[2:17:05.000 --> 2:17:06.000]  the whole 2,500 miles.
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:09.760]  He did what the border patrol told him, they're good, hardworking people, that's a rough job.
[2:17:09.760 --> 2:17:14.120]  They put in 560-something miles where they asked for it.
[2:17:14.120 --> 2:17:16.880]  They said, sir, we don't need to have the middle of nowhere where nobody crosses on
[2:17:16.880 --> 2:17:17.880]  mountain ranges.
[2:17:17.880 --> 2:17:22.320]  I know you said, we'll just build the whole wall, that seems smart, but those are walls,
[2:17:22.320 --> 2:17:24.120]  sir, you know, 100 miles of mountains.
[2:17:24.120 --> 2:17:29.640]  No, we needed here, here, here, here, and there, and they did it.
[2:17:29.640 --> 2:17:34.240]  Fentanyl was way down, all of it, methamphetamine, all of it now, methamphetamine is double
[2:17:34.240 --> 2:17:46.000]  the amount, ICE reports along with the DEA, 360 plus percent increase in fentanyl seizures,
[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:50.440]  even though they're not even enforcing, it's just pouring across, it's everywhere.
[2:17:50.440 --> 2:17:55.440]  I mean, folks, if you open a bag of that, accidentally breathe one grain, you're dead.
[2:17:55.440 --> 2:18:00.840]  You've got to be a serious heroin addict, even be able to, I mean, you put one grain
[2:18:00.840 --> 2:18:05.360]  in an ampule, I've gone and studied it, looked it out, it's done, read the FBI, I don't know
[2:18:05.360 --> 2:18:09.000]  what I'm talking about, it's got a little, a whole vial full of, let's say, 10 shots
[2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:12.840]  are going to take, I'm just hypothetically, you put one little grain in it and shake it
[2:18:12.840 --> 2:18:19.960]  up and then you can take the equivalent of 10 doses of major heroin off one little grain.
[2:18:19.960 --> 2:18:25.000]  You've got to have a nice little spoon with a little pile of heroin in it to cook that
[2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:26.360]  down and inject that in your vein.
[2:18:26.360 --> 2:18:35.560]  You need one grain of fentanyl to produce, on average, 10 injections, and boy, if you
[2:18:35.560 --> 2:18:41.560]  accidentally get a little too much in there, you are deader than a doorknob, deader than
[2:18:41.560 --> 2:18:44.120]  a hammer.
[2:18:44.120 --> 2:18:49.520]  And that's just, fountains of that are shooting in, oh, but we're worried, eight people got
[2:18:49.520 --> 2:18:54.520]  killed, and they're always demonizing cops, cops are evil, cops are Nazis, cops are bad,
[2:18:54.520 --> 2:18:59.360]  this cop had a great career, but then the force 20 years, well, that force 11 years,
[2:18:59.360 --> 2:19:03.800]  went in there and tried to stop the guy, pinned him down, got shot, killed himself, and he
[2:19:03.800 --> 2:19:09.920]  didn't get killed, I mean, he got killed, defending, and now we know his name.
[2:19:09.920 --> 2:19:13.200]  But normally it's, I mean, you heard about Black Lives Matter and Antifa shot dozens
[2:19:13.200 --> 2:19:17.360]  of police, many of them dead, shot citizens at checkpoints in the head, and you'd never
[2:19:17.360 --> 2:19:21.040]  even hear about it because the media, oh, oh, suppress that.
[2:19:21.040 --> 2:19:26.400]  These aren't liberals, these aren't even leftists, these are monsters that work for evil corporations
[2:19:26.400 --> 2:19:32.160]  that are at war with this country.
[2:19:32.160 --> 2:19:39.400]  Everything else we saw was simply preparatory phases of the attempted takeover of this nation.
[2:19:39.400 --> 2:19:46.400]  Now is the full assault on our currency, on our health, on our borders, on our dollar,
[2:19:46.400 --> 2:19:52.360]  on the pension funds, on everything, with a huge vertical integration, and I got to tell
[2:19:52.360 --> 2:19:59.360]  you, being in Connecticut, man, those people love wearing masks, they love submitting,
[2:19:59.360 --> 2:20:02.720]  and I mean, I'm not saying I'm the best looking guy, and I burned the camera both times, so
[2:20:02.720 --> 2:20:08.920]  I got my own problems, but man, these people didn't have a lick of spark in them.
[2:20:08.920 --> 2:20:14.360]  Right here in Texas, there's a fight in spirit still left, Missouri, Arkansas, even areas
[2:20:14.360 --> 2:20:18.440]  of Minnesota, you know, Colorado's got its problems, it doesn't matter, still, there's
[2:20:18.440 --> 2:20:24.120]  a lot of people that got a swing on their step, New York's got people with a swing on
[2:20:24.120 --> 2:20:30.080]  their step, man, I went to Connecticut, and there were a bunch of people posing like they
[2:20:30.080 --> 2:20:39.240]  were elitist, and then a bunch of scared poor people, and you could see, man, that they,
[2:20:39.240 --> 2:20:43.040]  everybody's been pulled out of there, and they've got a dark evil force just ruling
[2:20:43.040 --> 2:20:48.360]  over those people, and absolutely enjoying it, and we just have to get away from this
[2:20:48.360 --> 2:20:49.360]  evil.
[2:20:49.360 --> 2:20:52.920]  Alright, so there's the positive news, is this evil's going to burn itself out, the
[2:20:52.920 --> 2:20:57.600]  chai comms, the globals, they're already eating their own, everything they do turns to crap,
[2:20:57.600 --> 2:21:01.240]  we just have to be connected to God, do the right thing, and not submit to them, and speak
[2:21:01.240 --> 2:21:04.920]  out and warn people about what they're doing, and they'll be brought to justice, look at
[2:21:04.920 --> 2:21:08.280]  how the wheels are coming off of their vaccines, and all the deaths are coming out, and people
[2:21:08.280 --> 2:21:13.880]  are refusing it, so they double down and say, in the UK, all medical workers must now have
[2:21:13.880 --> 2:21:17.400]  a shot, well that's illegal, and now they're going to try to say that here, and Oregon
[2:21:17.400 --> 2:21:26.120]  says we're going to wear a mask permanently, and now England's saying it, it's a cult,
[2:21:26.120 --> 2:21:32.640]  and so you have to remember that the average leftist is a follower, and so you sit there
[2:21:32.640 --> 2:21:35.880]  and beat them over the head with the truth, they're not going to listen because they're
[2:21:35.880 --> 2:21:41.880]  already captured, they're already under Stockholm syndrome, but you can be a leader, and you
[2:21:41.880 --> 2:21:45.440]  can stand up, and you can say no, and you can find other leaders, and together we're
[2:21:45.440 --> 2:21:50.480]  that 3%, that 5%, hell there's more like 40% of the country, or more, that really gets
[2:21:50.480 --> 2:21:55.040]  what's happening, we just wake up one or two more people, and by wake them up, get them
[2:21:55.040 --> 2:21:59.960]  to get the spirit, it's over for the New World Order, and that's why they're launching their
[2:21:59.960 --> 2:22:05.840]  whole program now, they're behind schedule, they're in trouble, and it's going to be rough,
[2:22:05.840 --> 2:22:10.520]  and it's going to be terrible, but do you really think Charles Schumer, and do you really think
[2:22:10.520 --> 2:22:15.200]  Joe Biden, and do you really think the Rothschilds, and the Rockefellers, and Bill Gates, do you
[2:22:15.200 --> 2:22:19.920]  really think Prince Philip is going to end up ruling forever, these are pathetic people
[2:22:19.920 --> 2:22:24.760]  pretending they're in control, they've already lost, those of us third leaders though have
[2:22:24.760 --> 2:22:29.800]  to face them, have to press our will against them, and have to see the fight through, and
[2:22:29.800 --> 2:22:35.440]  then ask God for guidance, and ask God for direction, and say God I can't do it, I'm
[2:22:35.440 --> 2:22:40.680]  willing, but I need you to shine through me, I need you to come into me, I need you to
[2:22:40.680 --> 2:22:45.160]  lift me up, give that as your will, and then hit your knees, and prepare to get hit by
[2:22:45.160 --> 2:22:50.160]  the thunderbolt, call straight ahead.
[2:22:50.160 --> 2:22:55.640]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time, or my time, and rattle off the successes
[2:22:55.640 --> 2:23:01.160]  and full-worses that if you're paying attention, you know we've done together, but I'll tell
[2:23:01.160 --> 2:23:07.920]  you this, the technocrats are really upping their game, and they are trying to destroy
[2:23:07.920 --> 2:23:13.240]  all independent forms of media, they're trying to shudder and silence the human resistance,
[2:23:13.240 --> 2:23:19.000]  so now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate,
[2:23:19.000 --> 2:23:22.840]  everything you warned your friends and family about is around to be true, so it's now that
[2:23:22.840 --> 2:23:28.520]  your credibility is way up, the power structures are to silence those of us that they can't,
[2:23:28.520 --> 2:23:36.000]  but it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us, we have the power, but the sun
[2:23:36.000 --> 2:23:41.280]  is setting on humanity and setting on free speech, we have to make sure that we find
[2:23:41.280 --> 2:23:49.720]  our right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come, so be the polar bearer
[2:23:49.720 --> 2:23:54.400]  as you are.
[2:23:54.400 --> 2:23:59.880]  Look I've proven that in full-wars information is some of the best in the world, it's just
[2:23:59.880 --> 2:24:04.880]  absolutely on target, the globalists can't stand us because we've studied how they operate,
[2:24:04.880 --> 2:24:09.320]  they want to keep you in the dark, I believe in humanity, I want to see you empowered because
[2:24:09.320 --> 2:24:14.200]  I know that John F Kennedy was right, our raising tide raises all ships.

[2:24:51.040 --> 2:24:55.120]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins, why do you have
[2:24:55.120 --> 2:24:58.400]  multiple high-quality iodines, why do you do that?
[2:24:58.400 --> 2:25:02.480]  Because different strokes for different folks, if we're talking to researchers and scientists
[2:25:02.480 --> 2:25:07.280]  and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep-earth pure crystal iodine, but you should put one
[2:25:07.280 --> 2:25:11.440]  out with deeper crystal iodine and the two other types because some people can't absorb
[2:25:11.440 --> 2:25:12.440]  pure iodine.
[2:25:12.440 --> 2:25:15.880]  Boom, we did it, it's popular, it's X3, is it better than X2?
[2:25:15.880 --> 2:25:18.040]  You decide, it's different strokes for different folks.
[2:25:18.040 --> 2:25:23.840]  Well now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleeping, and
[2:25:23.840 --> 2:25:25.200]  that is down and out.
[2:25:25.200 --> 2:25:30.120]  It's super strong, way stronger than knockout, but they don't compete with each other.

[2:25:51.160 --> 2:25:55.880]  The people are awakening, they're taking control of their own environment.
[2:25:55.880 --> 2:25:57.640]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[2:25:57.640 --> 2:26:02.160]  Maybe they're a super computer that's handheld, but big tech, large corporations, hackers,
[2:26:02.160 --> 2:26:07.160]  governments, foreign governments, the chai comms especially, are using this to steal
[2:26:07.160 --> 2:26:11.840]  your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop
[2:26:11.840 --> 2:26:16.680]  up billions of people's data that can actually predict on record what's going to happen in
[2:26:16.680 --> 2:26:17.680]  mass movements.
[2:26:17.680 --> 2:26:24.760]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[2:26:24.760 --> 2:26:26.160]  In their own words, they admit it.
[2:26:26.160 --> 2:26:29.840]  So, I've been selling privacy pouches in block and pockets and things like that for
[2:26:29.840 --> 2:26:31.160]  more than a decade.
[2:26:31.160 --> 2:26:34.640]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight, they're faraday cages, they just look like
[2:26:34.640 --> 2:26:39.560]  a cloth envelope, they work absolutely great, and it just gives you that security to have
[2:26:39.560 --> 2:26:44.680]  power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want big
[2:26:44.680 --> 2:26:47.000]  brother to know what you're up to because it's another business.
[2:26:47.000 --> 2:26:53.640]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com today.
[2:26:53.640 --> 2:27:00.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:27:41.080 --> 2:27:44.880]  come on, man, we don't want your guns, but now he agrees with Beto or Rort, we're going
[2:27:44.880 --> 2:27:48.320]  to get all your guns because they're going to have all the bodyguards and you're going
[2:27:48.320 --> 2:27:52.360]  to have nothing while, again, Obama and other ship hundreds of thousands are not millions
[2:27:52.360 --> 2:27:56.680]  of guns in the Mexico and the Syria, never forget fast and furious.
[2:27:56.680 --> 2:28:02.520]  Here is the pretender in chief, here is the fraudster in chief, here is the frontman in
[2:28:02.520 --> 2:28:09.520]  chief, here is the imposter, the stooge, the reanimated corpse, here he is, Obama 2.0.
[2:28:10.960 --> 2:28:16.120]  The Senate should immediately pass, let me say it again, the United States Senate, I
[2:28:16.120 --> 2:28:20.720]  hope some are listening, should immediately pass the two house pass bill of the closed
[2:28:20.720 --> 2:28:26.760]  loopholes in the background check system. These are bills that receive votes of both
[2:28:26.760 --> 2:28:32.440]  Republicans and Democrats in the House. This is not, it should not be a partisan issue.
[2:28:32.440 --> 2:28:33.200]  Oh, yeah.
[2:28:33.200 --> 2:28:40.200]  This is an American issue. It will save lives, American lives, and we have to act. We should
[2:28:40.920 --> 2:28:47.360]  also ban assault weapons in the process. I'll have much more to say as we learn more, but
[2:28:47.360 --> 2:28:54.360]  I wanted to be clear. Those poor folks who died left behind families that leaves a big
[2:28:54.640 --> 2:29:01.640]  hole in their hearts. And, and, we can save lives, increasing the background checks so
[2:29:03.960 --> 2:29:08.480]  that they're supposed to occur, and eliminating assault weapons in the size of magazines.
[2:29:08.480 --> 2:29:14.240]  We don't know all the detail yet on that. But I'll be talking to you more later today
[2:29:14.240 --> 2:29:18.160]  or the next couple of days about what else we know.
[2:29:18.160 --> 2:29:25.160]  And there he is, reading off the teleprompter. Well, what you know is that it's all on infowars.com.
[2:29:25.240 --> 2:29:29.520]  Everybody needs to share it.
[2:29:29.520 --> 2:29:34.640]  Leptis activists down place, identity of Muslim suspect, or first calling him almost certainly
[2:29:34.640 --> 2:29:41.640]  white. There's a bunch of other articles on infowars.com dealing with it. And meanwhile,
[2:29:41.640 --> 2:29:47.640]  we've got Mitch McConnell saying H.R.1 is a Democrat plan to take over all American elections.
[2:29:47.640 --> 2:29:51.120]  Well, wait a minute, Mitch McConnell, you said that the election wasn't stolen, even
[2:29:51.120 --> 2:29:55.000]  though there was evidence of that. And there's a litmus test to say Biden's legitimate, despite
[2:29:55.000 --> 2:29:59.640]  the evidence. Daylight and a dollar short, you rat, Tommy bastard.
[2:29:59.640 --> 2:30:06.320]  All right, let's go to the calls now for the next hour and 25 minutes we have left this
[2:30:06.320 --> 2:30:13.320]  live broadcast today. I appreciate Omar and Greg and Boris and Bill and Gerald and Breton,
[2:30:13.720 --> 2:30:17.960]  Camilo and Owen and Josh and Roger and David all holding.
[2:30:17.960 --> 2:30:21.960]  First up holding the longest would be Owen in Massachusetts. Owen, thanks for calling
[2:30:21.960 --> 2:30:25.440]  today while you still can call the show. We might be shut down soon. Whole country's
[2:30:25.440 --> 2:30:27.800]  going to hell. Thanks for joining us. Go ahead.
[2:30:27.800 --> 2:30:35.800]  Hey, Alex. So I just want to preface this message with what Paul said in first collage
[2:30:35.800 --> 2:30:41.720]  because it's kind of scary. What I'm going to say, he said that the powers of darkness
[2:30:41.720 --> 2:30:48.720]  were defeated on the cross. And that is the, that is our only hope right now. Look, I had
[2:30:48.720 --> 2:30:55.720]  the FBI show up in my house. I have a TikTok account in Snapchat and I basically preached
[2:30:56.240 --> 2:31:02.560]  the gospel on there and I went into the vaccine. I'm very kind of nervous on this phone call
[2:31:02.560 --> 2:31:03.560]  to be honest with you because
[2:31:03.560 --> 2:31:07.800]  it's okay. So the FBI is run by the Chinese now and it's run by the global. So they just,
[2:31:07.800 --> 2:31:12.800]  they're told just to come out and intimidate you. It's all, it's nothing to be afraid of.
[2:31:12.800 --> 2:31:16.120]  Go ahead. They just want to make sure that they can get as much of that poison the old
[2:31:16.120 --> 2:31:19.480]  people's possible. The average FBI agent doesn't know. They're just sent out to intimidate
[2:31:19.480 --> 2:31:23.280]  you. So, so, so why did the FBI come visit you? What, what did they say?
[2:31:23.280 --> 2:31:28.680]  So I basically said that it was the mark of the beast and don't take it.
[2:31:28.680 --> 2:31:32.120]  Well, it is the mark of the beast. So what were they asking? Son, are you planning something
[2:31:32.120 --> 2:31:36.560]  or what did they say to you? Yeah, they said they referenced a bunch of old posts on my
[2:31:36.560 --> 2:31:43.160]  Instagram like, oh, this was a threat. And there's a, it's called Luciferis. I'm not
[2:31:43.160 --> 2:31:44.160]  sure.
[2:31:44.160 --> 2:31:48.400]  Well, so what they're doing is they're putting out a giant dragnet and then you fit in some
[2:31:48.400 --> 2:31:52.360]  computer program, a profile of what they're worried about. So I just wouldn't get freaked
[2:31:52.360 --> 2:31:56.680]  out about it. I become more vocal and go out and speak and just be confident. How old
[2:31:56.680 --> 2:31:57.680]  are you?
[2:31:57.680 --> 2:32:02.680]  I'm 20. I've been listening to you since my freshman year of high school when I was 15.
[2:32:02.680 --> 2:32:07.320]  Yeah, this is all just a dragnet of intimidation. So, I mean, obviously you told them, no, I'm
[2:32:07.320 --> 2:32:11.120]  not planning any threat, like the children being smuggled in across the border being
[2:32:11.120 --> 2:32:12.640]  sold to sex slavery.
[2:32:12.640 --> 2:32:18.200]  Yeah. I mean, because they have AI and it says, oh, mark of the beast, don't take the
[2:32:18.200 --> 2:32:24.760]  vaccine. And the very next morning there were four FBI agents at my door and look, we're
[2:32:24.760 --> 2:32:28.320]  in a spiritual war. That's the only way. Yes, we are. And I appreciate your calling. God
[2:32:28.320 --> 2:32:32.600]  bless you, sir. I mean, I know a bunch of people. My medical doctor got visited by the
[2:32:32.600 --> 2:32:38.040]  FBI because she's a Trump supporter. And it was meant to embarrass her at the clinic.
[2:32:38.040 --> 2:32:43.000]  She works at, they're all Trump supporters. They're all completely awake now. So this
[2:32:43.000 --> 2:32:47.760]  is not going to have the effect. They think it is on us. This is all a foreign power and
[2:32:47.760 --> 2:32:52.000]  China has taken a suburb. They have a puppet president. They've broken the southern border.
[2:32:52.000 --> 2:32:56.920]  They're smuggling tens of thousands of children a month. This is a criminal takeover and the
[2:32:56.920 --> 2:33:01.720]  FBI has been ordered to suppress the American people to intimidate us so they can criminally
[2:33:01.720 --> 2:33:06.240]  finish the country off. And that's what's happening.
[2:33:06.240 --> 2:33:12.920]  And so I'm not even defending the FBI. I'm not attacking the FBI. They're errand boys
[2:33:12.920 --> 2:33:17.920]  just sent out. They've been ordered to go out and stop another capital event or stop
[2:33:17.920 --> 2:33:23.320]  another. And the FBI director says, oh, Antifa, there's no such thing as that. I mean, it's
[2:33:23.320 --> 2:33:28.360]  all just gas lining. It's all a bunch of lawyers that already sold the country out. They're
[2:33:28.360 --> 2:33:32.640]  scared. They already got their hundreds of millions a piece at the top, billions, some
[2:33:32.640 --> 2:33:36.800]  of them. And they're just trying to secure and get a home in Switzerland or a home in
[2:33:36.800 --> 2:33:42.920]  New Zealand. They're all just rearguard action before the country goes down. So don't worry
[2:33:42.920 --> 2:33:47.360]  about them. It's going to be down soon, folks. There won't be any FBI agents. There will
[2:33:47.360 --> 2:33:53.000]  be nothing. We'll be like Mexico, total failed state. Okay. I mean, it's the universities
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:57.680]  are gone. It's it's all over. But in a way, that's good. We're a satanic nation. So we're
[2:33:57.680 --> 2:34:03.080]  going under judgment. Okay, let's talk to Josh in Florida. Josh, thanks for holding
[2:34:03.080 --> 2:34:12.280]  your own here. Hey, Alex. So what I see going on is we're now entering the age of distraction
[2:34:12.280 --> 2:34:20.040]  because how else do you confuse the people with a puppet president like Biden? You open
[2:34:20.040 --> 2:34:25.520]  up the borders. You talk about COVID. And I think we're going to leave this is going
[2:34:25.520 --> 2:34:31.040]  to lead to more shootings, more attacks, and another proxy war in the Middle East that
[2:34:31.040 --> 2:34:38.600]  will eventually lead to war. And the next lockdown being the internet, which is now
[2:34:38.600 --> 2:34:44.000]  under UN control. I can I can is now under UN control. That's right. That happened before
[2:34:44.000 --> 2:34:49.320]  Trump even got in. Obama signed it over. And yeah, we're here. We're under world government
[2:34:49.320 --> 2:34:56.200]  right now. This is the breaking of the nation. Exactly. And part of a disinformation campaign
[2:34:56.200 --> 2:35:02.800]  is putting out so much information, even true information. And that's part of the problem
[2:35:02.800 --> 2:35:08.560]  with what Q was all about. It was a disinformation campaign that was just loaded with so much
[2:35:08.560 --> 2:35:12.040]  information. Nobody knew where to put their fit.
[2:35:12.040 --> 2:35:17.560]  Well, sure. And then they put dates on it, just credit real info on purpose. And people
[2:35:17.560 --> 2:35:20.760]  felt like, well, Q exposed the New World Order. Why don't you talk about the Federal Reserve
[2:35:20.760 --> 2:35:25.040]  being private? I'm like, I covered it 27 years ago. Well, Q actually did that. Don't steal
[2:35:25.040 --> 2:35:29.760]  it from Q now. So it was newbies that we woke up had to be controlled by the Q movement
[2:35:29.760 --> 2:35:36.760]  and misdirected. Yeah. So I see in the next two years, an ISIS resurgence, maybe in the
[2:35:36.760 --> 2:35:43.040]  next two years, maybe another proxy war or a hot war. And this is going to lead to cyberwar,
[2:35:43.040 --> 2:35:47.480]  which is going to lead to the Internet. I agree. They're going to claim outside forces
[2:35:47.480 --> 2:35:50.360]  that we're going to bring down the Internet. Just like we're having power outages. We're
[2:35:50.360 --> 2:35:54.880]  just going to learn to live in a third world country. I think you're dead on, brother.
[2:35:54.880 --> 2:36:03.360]  Yeah. Everybody needs to learn about ICANN and Iron Mountain. And they're the ones that
[2:36:03.360 --> 2:36:08.960]  issue your IP. They're the ones that control the domain name services. And if there's a
[2:36:08.960 --> 2:36:15.040]  problem with big tech, everybody needs to look to ICANN and start asking questions.
[2:36:15.040 --> 2:36:20.120]  I totally agree. I mean, there are only a few domains that'll even take gab or info wars.
[2:36:20.120 --> 2:36:25.040]  Epic is the best. And they're trying to shut that down. You're absolutely right, people.
[2:36:25.040 --> 2:36:29.080]  We're so close to the total collapse of everything. And I'm not being negative about that. I'm
[2:36:29.080 --> 2:36:33.920]  not going to lie to you. This is just an absolute new role order. World government takeover.
[2:36:33.920 --> 2:36:38.120]  It's not coming. We're here. It's 2021. We're in it now. It's here. And people ask what
[2:36:38.120 --> 2:36:41.240]  comes next. We've got a caller asking that question. I'll tell you what I think on the

[2:38:59.920 --> 2:39:05.080]  Challenge. First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and for all
[2:39:05.080 --> 2:39:09.760]  the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was
[2:39:09.760 --> 2:39:15.480]  loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called. But since taking your x2
[2:39:15.480 --> 2:39:20.280]  for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous. Actually, people think I'm
[2:39:20.280 --> 2:39:26.360]  55 years old and I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know,
[2:39:26.360 --> 2:39:30.840]  well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[2:39:30.840 --> 2:39:35.360]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately. But you know, over a period
[2:39:35.360 --> 2:39:40.560]  of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket. This is working. This is
[2:39:40.560 --> 2:39:46.240]  wonderful. You know, I don't, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know. So
[2:39:46.240 --> 2:39:51.280]  anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[2:39:51.280 --> 2:39:55.000]  Actually, we bought this at Blocks, UHF frequency.
[2:39:55.000 --> 2:40:01.080]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us, not just tracking
[2:40:01.080 --> 2:40:08.160]  and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well with or without a

[2:40:58.280 --> 2:41:13.360]  Look, when I get up here on air and I lay out how bad things are, it's because I believe
[2:41:13.360 --> 2:41:17.320]  in you. And I believe that when you're faced with the reality, you're going to get ready
[2:41:17.320 --> 2:41:22.880]  and do something about it. I mean, this is it. I mean, they just starved. They admitted
[2:41:22.880 --> 2:41:27.800]  the UN and an extra 10 and a half million people to death in the last year, shutting
[2:41:27.800 --> 2:41:31.400]  down the third world. I mean, they starved people to death in their damn houses that
[2:41:31.400 --> 2:41:36.560]  worked on farms and facilities supplying us with food. And when those things shut down,
[2:41:36.560 --> 2:41:41.480]  they just go starve to death at home. And the UN and the globalists run brutal regimes
[2:41:41.480 --> 2:41:46.480]  where they've got arm checkpoints at every corner street with the huts. And if somebody
[2:41:46.480 --> 2:41:50.440]  rebels or gets up, they just shoot them dead. So people just very solemnly go home and they
[2:41:50.440 --> 2:41:56.080]  starve to death with their children. And a lot of leftists will say, well, that's, you
[2:41:56.080 --> 2:41:59.800]  know, that's just too many people. But they tell you all day how much they love you. Look
[2:41:59.800 --> 2:42:07.200]  at her. Look at Saki. She's a freaking vampire, man. Look at Ryan Stelter. Look at these people.
[2:42:07.200 --> 2:42:19.880]  They're a bunch of evil lawyers, soulless scum. Of course, HR one is a Democrat plan
[2:42:19.880 --> 2:42:24.000]  to take over all American elections. Let's get that video, please, guys. And by the way,
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:27.240]  those are not photoshopped photos. If you're looking at Kamala Harris and Biden, those
[2:42:27.240 --> 2:42:34.920]  are real screenshots. These people are evil. And when I say they're not even physically
[2:42:34.920 --> 2:42:38.240]  ugly, it's that they're not real. Like when you see a mannequin or you see like I say
[2:42:38.240 --> 2:42:43.080]  plastic fruit, you know, it's plastic fruit. No matter how good it is, no matter how fake
[2:42:43.080 --> 2:42:48.040]  it is, you look at it, you know, that's fake. You just know. And you look at them, you go,
[2:42:48.040 --> 2:42:52.960]  that's not normal. That's not normal. Look at Brian Stelter. That's not normal. That's
[2:42:52.960 --> 2:43:02.120]  an enemy. That's the enemy. God, blag it. Yeah, here's some of them go to your calls.
[2:43:02.120 --> 2:43:07.480]  Here's Mitch McConnell who said if you don't agree, the election was legitimate. You're
[2:43:07.480 --> 2:43:14.160]  basically a terrorist. You're bad. You're evil. Everybody should concede. Now he admits
[2:43:14.160 --> 2:43:21.720]  the truth about HR one. Here it is. The big item here in the Senate this week are the
[2:43:21.720 --> 2:43:29.760]  hearings on HR one, the Democratic plan to take over all of American elections and centralize
[2:43:29.760 --> 2:43:38.280]  them here in Washington. It is replete with problems. And they all think it's mainly to
[2:43:38.280 --> 2:43:44.560]  be the quiet types and not talk and act real serious. These are nothing but knuckle-draggers
[2:43:44.560 --> 2:43:48.680]  that work for China. And I mean the Republican leadership as well. Kin, Starr, all of them.
[2:43:48.680 --> 2:43:52.880]  They've been working for them forever. Hell, it was Nixon opened the whole damn thing up
[2:43:52.880 --> 2:43:58.520]  and began with. Sold us down the river. And he got set up later. He meant well. All right,
[2:43:58.520 --> 2:44:03.040]  let's go to the next caller. Who's been home the longest here? Is it Camilo? Is it CD?
[2:44:03.040 --> 2:44:07.200]  Is it Greg? What are they going to do next? Yeah, Greg, that's a good question. Go ahead
[2:44:07.200 --> 2:44:10.360]  and ask your question and give us your take. Greg and Florida, go ahead.
[2:44:10.360 --> 2:44:15.360]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex? Man, I'm just, we're living the nightmare. We're in the middle
[2:44:15.360 --> 2:44:20.360]  of the world government takeover. Man, I'm telling you. And I always say it by hats
[2:44:20.360 --> 2:44:26.240]  off to you for keeping everybody informed of what's going on out there and what's coming.
[2:44:26.240 --> 2:44:32.840]  I talk to people all over the world on a daily basis. A lot of countries, they all know what's
[2:44:32.840 --> 2:44:42.600]  happening. I will say this though. The only people that don't mention anything about the
[2:44:42.600 --> 2:44:50.840]  vaccine or the globalist are my clients in the UK. These guys are really, these people
[2:44:50.840 --> 2:44:55.280]  seem to be really subdued. I don't know if they're afraid to talk on the phone or what's
[2:44:55.280 --> 2:45:00.640]  the problem, but I talked to a guy three, four times a day in Australia. And for the
[2:45:00.640 --> 2:45:07.640]  last few months, these guys, they're all up to speed. Guys and the only people I talk
[2:45:07.640 --> 2:45:15.000]  to from China are their agents over here. I have not talked to many people in mainland
[2:45:15.000 --> 2:45:21.040]  China over the last several months. I just talked to their agents here. But South America
[2:45:21.040 --> 2:45:25.960]  and everything, of course, they know, you know, they know all about communism and things
[2:45:25.960 --> 2:45:36.040]  like that. But anyways, my question is, what do you think is the next big plan, the real
[2:45:36.040 --> 2:45:42.440]  plan that's going on? Now they got this COVID thing. And I almost think that, of course,
[2:45:42.440 --> 2:45:48.640]  it's smoke and mirrors. And I know when the World Bank issued those bonds a couple years
[2:45:48.640 --> 2:45:54.960]  ago, the only way that those bonds were not going to be payable is if there was a pandemic.
[2:45:54.960 --> 2:45:59.520]  And of course, the pandemic came with it. Oh, I'm glad you mentioned that. I totally
[2:45:59.520 --> 2:46:06.200]  forgot that the UN issued pandemic bonds, but massive was it 50 billion or some ridiculous
[2:46:06.200 --> 2:46:10.240]  numbers that got leveraged. And then if there was a pandemic, they didn't have to pay and
[2:46:10.240 --> 2:46:14.920]  they had like a month. Oh, I meant to cover that. Yeah, yeah, refresh my memory. That
[2:46:14.920 --> 2:46:22.560]  came out about a month ago. Tell folks about that. Well, what happened is they they get
[2:46:22.560 --> 2:46:28.600]  countries. There's countries that that invest in their health system invest in that's hoping
[2:46:28.600 --> 2:46:33.120]  the UN will help them. But all the UN is a conduit of big pharma. And then right before
[2:46:33.120 --> 2:46:38.960]  the money was due to be paid to them, they they launched a pandemic incredible. Absolutely.
[2:46:38.960 --> 2:46:43.560]  And so nobody got paid. Well, except the guys that took the initial money in for the bond.
[2:46:43.560 --> 2:46:47.320]  What was the exact headline? I saw that six months ago, a month ago, I meant to cover
[2:46:47.320 --> 2:46:52.440]  it. It was a UN declared pandemic one month before they had to reimburse countries. Or
[2:46:52.440 --> 2:46:57.080]  what was that line? Correct? It was about it was about a month when they when they came
[2:46:57.080 --> 2:47:04.080]  out with it. But it was in the works. You know, as far as what I read the article was
[2:47:04.080 --> 2:47:08.920]  like of the Australian news. Wow. Yeah, guys, pull that up if you can find it. That is that's
[2:47:08.920 --> 2:47:11.720]  why we love to take calls because there's so much stuff we forget about or don't know
[2:47:11.720 --> 2:47:17.080]  about. And isn't that amazing that it wasn't even a technical pandemic? They just called
[2:47:17.080 --> 2:47:20.840]  it a pandemic because a pandemic supposed to have a certain amount of death. It doesn't
[2:47:20.840 --> 2:47:26.640]  pandemic bonds. What the WHO declaration means for investors? Yeah, the Motley Fool did not
[2:47:26.640 --> 2:47:30.720]  pay it. A great point, brother. What do you think they're going to pull next? I mean,
[2:47:30.720 --> 2:47:35.280]  I've got my view. What's your view? You're a smart guy. Here's what I think, you know,
[2:47:35.280 --> 2:47:42.160]  what I know. And, you know, some people I talked to some, some large bankers around there,
[2:47:42.160 --> 2:47:50.040]  not the not the big guys, but, you know, I gather that, you know, I really believe,
[2:47:50.040 --> 2:47:56.320]  I really believe in this has to do a lot with faith as well. You have to have faith that
[2:47:56.320 --> 2:48:02.840]  what's going on now is a big dog and pony show on a big on a big level. Oh yeah, it's
[2:48:02.840 --> 2:48:07.520]  a distraction from all the other stuff they're doing. Exactly. You know, I mean, you know,
[2:48:07.520 --> 2:48:11.520]  coming out with a robot, you know, this kind of technology in these clones and all that
[2:48:11.520 --> 2:48:17.440]  well, they've had that for some time. But what's really going on, you know what, Alex,
[2:48:17.440 --> 2:48:27.600]  I think it is it all boils down to currency. Okay, it all boils down to wealth. These people,
[2:48:27.600 --> 2:48:32.040]  you know, these you said China's produced more billionaires in the last year than all
[2:48:32.040 --> 2:48:37.240]  of the billionaires produced in the last year. The big Texas all the power, this is economic
[2:48:37.240 --> 2:48:41.800]  warfare, bringing in their control grid and tightening down the screws all at the same
[2:48:41.800 --> 2:48:49.240]  time. Absolutely. And I believe I believe this, that the guys that the countries, they're
[2:48:49.240 --> 2:48:54.520]  allowing these countries to create wealth. That's that's what I think the big picture
[2:48:54.520 --> 2:48:59.760]  is. They're allowing China to do this. Oh, they've totally chosen China with the one
[2:48:59.760 --> 2:49:05.560]  side. Exactly. That's where their investments are. Exactly. Yeah, you know, I'll let me
[2:49:05.560 --> 2:49:11.800]  tell you something real, real quick. Okay, as far as this stuff with the Keystone closing
[2:49:11.800 --> 2:49:18.200]  down our pipeline and Warren Buffett with his railway system getting paid, you know,
[2:49:18.200 --> 2:49:23.000]  with his big contract coming up to get paid billions of dollars to transport the oil down
[2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:33.520]  from Canada, et cetera, et cetera. Several years ago, Rolls-Royce was did a huge contract
[2:49:33.520 --> 2:49:39.720]  to build these special machines to go out. They would go out from the shore from the
[2:49:39.720 --> 2:49:49.120]  mainland shoreline out in the ocean. China has so many offshore wells right now, drilling
[2:49:49.120 --> 2:49:56.120]  oil. It's, and you know, this is never, you'll never hear about it. But you know, I do business,
[2:49:56.120 --> 2:50:02.800]  like I said, I do all kinds of business around the world. And they, you're dead right. They
[2:50:02.800 --> 2:50:06.960]  have totally taken over. They've set it where you can only do business in China. And now
[2:50:06.960 --> 2:50:11.000]  they're going to shut down the rest of our plants. It'll be impossible here. We are literally
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:14.560]  being conquered. God bless you. And I appreciate your call. Amazing. Anything else, Greg?
[2:50:14.560 --> 2:50:19.360]  He's gone. They have such smart callers. I'm going to start the fourth hour. I'm going
[2:50:19.360 --> 2:50:22.920]  to host a full fourth hour. I'm going to get to every call that's on the board. I'm going
[2:50:22.920 --> 2:50:26.560]  to try to move quicker, but these are great callers. So I'm going to get to all of you.
[2:50:26.560 --> 2:50:31.840]  Separately, I'm not funded by Rolls-Royce or Ted Turner or Bill Gates or Warren Buffett
[2:50:31.840 --> 2:50:35.640]  or George Soros or any of them. I could be. I could roll over real fast. I'm not doing
[2:50:35.640 --> 2:50:39.400]  it. I physically can't do it. Put a gun in my head. I'm not doing it. But I'm only here
[2:50:39.400 --> 2:50:43.480]  because of you. So thanks for the support. We got great products you already need. They're
[2:50:43.480 --> 2:50:47.400]  moving against everybody right now. As much capital as I get in their coffers to operate
[2:50:47.400 --> 2:50:51.800]  in the future would be great. But it's all up to God. And I know God's going to move
[2:50:51.800 --> 2:50:58.560]  you if you want to support us. Please do it. Infoorstore.com. And we have this new big sale

[2:52:41.400 --> 2:52:50.440]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World. Even
[2:52:50.440 --> 2:52:55.160]  before I had an access to your show in the mid-1990s, I went and saw that movie and thought,
[2:52:55.160 --> 2:53:00.040]  that was fun. In fact, you speak out and have your own ideas and even if you're a nerd,
[2:53:00.040 --> 2:53:03.920]  you're still entertaining because you're real. Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[2:53:03.920 --> 2:53:10.160]  We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't
[2:53:10.160 --> 2:53:14.120]  feel worthy to talk to you because these topics are so huge, they're so real. But I'm trying
[2:53:14.120 --> 2:53:17.640]  to tell you the truth. I'm trying to get it right and most of the time we do. The globalists
[2:53:17.640 --> 2:53:23.720]  love lying to you. They love manipulating you. They enjoy destroying humanity. They enjoy
[2:53:23.720 --> 2:53:28.840]  manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them. That, for me, is really satan
[2:53:28.840 --> 2:53:34.760]  and disgusting. So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole InfoWars crew that we
[2:53:34.760 --> 2:53:39.120]  will never join the globalists. We will never know who we manipulate you because we know
[2:53:39.120 --> 2:53:44.200]  we're all in this together.
[2:53:44.200 --> 2:53:54.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:53:54.200 --> 2:54:02.200]  Finally, ladies and gentlemen, it's high noon. Black talk.
[2:54:02.200 --> 2:54:18.200]  Rollin' below the asphalt drive. A concrete fascination scraping the edge of nothing.
[2:54:18.200 --> 2:54:23.200]  Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.
[2:54:23.200 --> 2:54:29.720]  Soon the globalists will collapse all the civilization and get on themselves. We must
[2:54:29.720 --> 2:54:35.440]  be prepared to survive it, to rebuild civilization, and then commence, again, the operation to
[2:54:35.440 --> 2:54:39.720]  the stars and beyond. Our mission will not be thwarted.
[2:54:39.720 --> 2:54:42.720]  Finally, nothing.
[2:54:42.720 --> 2:54:46.320]  All right, let's go back to your phone calls. I've got some big news, but I'm going to get
[2:54:46.320 --> 2:54:50.400]  a little bit more information on it before I hit it. They are flooding the airwaves and
[2:54:50.400 --> 2:54:55.880]  the print and the Internet with mass shootings are everywhere, surging, so they're mixing
[2:54:55.880 --> 2:55:01.040]  the word surge like it's a virus in with mass shooting and just saying, there's mass shootings
[2:55:01.040 --> 2:55:06.200]  everywhere, so now they're upping the level of this info.
[2:55:06.200 --> 2:55:09.880]  I will show you that coming up next segment. Yeah, put me that article, too. Thanks. But
[2:55:09.880 --> 2:55:19.880]  right now, who has been on the longest now, that would be Omar in North Carolina. Omar,
[2:55:19.880 --> 2:55:21.880]  thank you for holding. Go ahead.
[2:55:21.880 --> 2:55:24.400]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing today?
[2:55:24.400 --> 2:55:29.880]  I'm good to be back in the ATX. I tell you, Connecticut was a very beautiful place, very
[2:55:29.880 --> 2:55:30.880]  creepy.
[2:55:30.880 --> 2:55:36.360]  That's great to hear. So, yeah, today, my call is basically that today is the one year anniversary
[2:55:36.360 --> 2:55:41.000]  where I was about to fly across the country over here in North Carolina where I am now,
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:48.400]  and I've been here this whole year. I flew from LAX and man, just the scene of the chicken
[2:55:48.400 --> 2:55:53.400]  little of people just wearing hazmat suits and freaking out and acting like if you touch
[2:55:53.400 --> 2:55:57.200]  them that they're going to die and stuff, which is crazy.
[2:55:57.200 --> 2:56:03.600]  And I just remember vividly watching your broadcast that day. I think it's something
[2:56:03.600 --> 2:56:11.320]  about like PsyOps destroys or cripple the U.S. economy, panic Trump, injects 4 trillion
[2:56:11.320 --> 2:56:18.640]  to the economy. And I went back to see that episode again just recently last night, and
[2:56:18.640 --> 2:56:27.840]  I was just blown away by how many accurate predictions or just based off what you know.
[2:56:27.840 --> 2:56:33.320]  You said that this was going to keep going. I just never thought that a year later we'd
[2:56:33.320 --> 2:56:38.320]  be in this position. And the fact that when I was getting on the plane, I think one of
[2:56:38.320 --> 2:56:44.680]  the guests, I don't remember who it was, they were saying that China was already opening
[2:56:44.680 --> 2:56:48.880]  back to the factory to back up. And in the beginning of the year, they shut production
[2:56:48.880 --> 2:56:53.480]  down and that was like their whole feeder that they were playing. But as soon as like
[2:56:53.480 --> 2:56:58.960]  the whole lockdown's got announced and everything down here, it was like instantly they're already
[2:56:58.960 --> 2:57:06.080]  like turning everything back on like, okay. To me it was just crazy. And I was just like,
[2:57:06.080 --> 2:57:13.000]  I was watching as well your old film, American Distorted by Design where you were going on
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:18.480]  the road trips interviewing people about what was going on. And it was just super crazy
[2:57:18.480 --> 2:57:26.880]  to me to think like, well, I wonder if Jones would have ever thought that we'd be here
[2:57:26.880 --> 2:57:34.800]  in this position where he's sitting in the studio getting instant messages from like
[2:57:34.800 --> 2:57:39.040]  his little device, his little supercomputer, and just being able to just fight back with
[2:57:39.040 --> 2:57:43.400]  information. Did you ever think that you would reach this point, sir? And I would just like
[2:57:43.400 --> 2:57:44.400]  to see it.
[2:57:44.400 --> 2:57:47.720]  No, I mean, I didn't. I knew that the globalist started a lot of bad things. I knew they were
[2:57:47.720 --> 2:57:50.840]  getting partial control of the planet and meant to get full control. And I knew they
[2:57:50.840 --> 2:57:57.000]  were planning depopulation and technocracy. But it's one thing to hypothetically imagine
[2:57:57.000 --> 2:58:01.400]  what they're going to do. It's nothing to actually see it. But we're so far along now
[2:58:01.400 --> 2:58:05.000]  that we're definitely in the rabbit hole. They are brainwashing our children, teaching
[2:58:05.000 --> 2:58:09.040]  them that humans are toxic, teaching them that they are all medical experiments, being
[2:58:09.040 --> 2:58:14.880]  inducted into a giant Joseph Mingola style takeover. So they have just really trained
[2:58:14.880 --> 2:58:18.520]  people in the nanny state that we're going to protect you. Oh, somebody handed out pocket
[2:58:18.520 --> 2:58:22.000]  constitutions today at the campus. You're all going to play with Play-Doh. That's grown
[2:58:22.000 --> 2:58:26.920]  adults will imagine what the children are like. They think this system is their friend
[2:58:26.920 --> 2:58:30.760]  when it's a system designed to exterminate them. We'll be right back. Thanks for the
[2:58:30.760 --> 2:58:31.760]  call.
[2:58:31.760 --> 2:58:35.200]  Tell people the date real quick. What was the particular show you were watching that you
[2:58:35.200 --> 2:58:41.280]  thought showed a lot of the things that came to pass? Be dropped. Now, you can all go back
[2:58:41.280 --> 2:58:44.760]  to stuff a year ago. It all came true. Not because I predicted it. The enemy said what
[2:58:44.760 --> 2:58:49.800]  they would do to you. We'll be right back.
[2:58:49.800 --> 2:58:54.960]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large. The population has been trained to submit
[2:58:54.960 --> 2:58:59.640]  to what you're told. It's all going to pass. But if you study authoritarian, if you study
[2:58:59.640 --> 2:59:03.760]  the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta
[2:59:03.760 --> 2:59:07.520]  and you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved. And because the globalists
[2:59:07.520 --> 2:59:12.160]  see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move. And they are collapsing
[2:59:12.160 --> 2:59:16.320]  the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the third world that
[2:59:16.320 --> 2:59:22.600]  the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load, capitulate
[2:59:22.600 --> 2:59:27.240]  to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the blood
[2:59:27.240 --> 2:59:33.200]  of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus
[2:59:33.200 --> 2:59:38.680]  Schwabber is saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year long lockdowns that the
[2:59:38.680 --> 2:59:44.520]  UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank
[2:59:44.520 --> 2:59:53.920]  money. And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalist rallying Patriots
[2:59:53.920 --> 3:00:07.400]  worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones. I mean, here's the good news.
[3:00:07.400 --> 3:00:11.600]  God's real. Here's the bad news. The New World Order is making its move on humanity. It's
[3:00:11.600 --> 3:00:16.480]  extremely predatory. They've got a good half the population not knowing what planet they're
[3:00:16.480 --> 3:00:20.720]  on. They can't find their butt with both hands. And you could join the globalists and feed
[3:00:20.720 --> 3:00:25.460]  on them for a while, but it's going to end up getting to you. This type of corruption
[3:00:25.460 --> 3:00:31.400]  does not just stop at one point. It spirals out of control. And we're already into the
[3:00:31.400 --> 3:00:37.720]  spiraling out of control part. And so I'm just going to trust in God and try to be as truthful
[3:00:37.720 --> 3:00:42.400]  and honest and accurate as I can in this imperfect vessel that I am. And I know you're
[3:00:42.400 --> 3:00:46.160]  going to be the same. And I just want you to know I love you all. I love you if you're
[3:00:46.160 --> 3:00:50.960]  black, I love you if you're brown, I love you if you're white, I love you if you're pink.
[3:00:50.960 --> 3:00:55.720]  But I tell you, I really don't like you if you're anti-human and a liar and a scumbag
[3:00:55.720 --> 3:01:01.160]  and a control freak. And a lot of you that aren't predators, though, still playing the
[3:01:01.160 --> 3:01:08.440]  predator's hands, you're just like, oh, I'm a victim. Oh, oh, I need to protect myself.
[3:01:08.440 --> 3:01:15.000]  I'm going to wear a face mask. I'm going to buy into all these lies where you act like
[3:01:15.000 --> 3:01:21.000]  and behave like you're doing these silly things show that you all are seen as good people.
[3:01:21.000 --> 3:01:27.600]  It's beyond virtue signaling. It's a symbol that you are in a cult that you have no common
[3:01:27.600 --> 3:01:36.360]  sense for yourself. If there was a real pathogen killing 4% of the population, like they said,
[3:01:36.360 --> 3:01:41.440]  I would call for anybody that showed symptoms to be quarantined. But it wasn't one-tenth
[3:01:41.440 --> 3:01:46.880]  of 1%. And then that was all based on fake PCR tests. And it's a globalist power grab
[3:01:46.880 --> 3:01:51.760]  and they now admit we want lockdowns for carbon. They're just teaching you to be locked in
[3:01:51.760 --> 3:01:58.120]  your freaking house and have your app tell you when you can go somewhere and do something.
[3:01:58.120 --> 3:02:04.080]  They're building a prison planet. It's out of the open. It's not even my opinion anymore.
[3:02:04.080 --> 3:02:07.440]  And, you know, there has been the weird effect for me personally. People ask me, what do
[3:02:07.440 --> 3:02:11.480]  you think is coming next? I mean, I've gotten to see what's coming next. All these prominent
[3:02:11.480 --> 3:02:18.280]  people, even my enemies now say, where's the crystal ball? What's happening next? How do
[3:02:18.280 --> 3:02:25.420]  you know all this? Because most of them are either selfish or lazy or they only study
[3:02:25.420 --> 3:02:33.760]  certain specific places that make them money. They're an expert on dentistry or auto mechanic
[3:02:33.760 --> 3:02:37.560]  or teaching the class they teach. And while they're teaching that class, they want to
[3:02:37.560 --> 3:02:42.280]  go play golf. I'm not like that. Our audience isn't like that. And really, that's who the
[3:02:42.280 --> 3:02:46.400]  globalist is. It's not me. I mean, they really hate me. But you know what I mean? They hate
[3:02:46.400 --> 3:02:52.480]  you because you're people that kick the tires. You look under the hood. You're figuring out
[3:02:52.480 --> 3:02:59.280]  what's going on here. They don't want that. You heard the NAACP head in New York say,
[3:02:59.280 --> 3:03:04.920]  do not ask questions. Take whatever they give you, stick your arm on, dig it. You're like,
[3:03:04.920 --> 3:03:10.880]  that sounds crazy because you're not under their control. You're not in the damn trance.
[3:03:10.880 --> 3:03:17.920]  And thank God you're not. Yeah, we'll play here in a minute and go to calls. Imagine
[3:03:17.920 --> 3:03:24.680]  being one of those people. Now, you don't think that lady, you know, who set up the NAACP,
[3:03:24.680 --> 3:03:31.560]  you know, who set up Margaret Sanger. They were all involved. W. D. D. Du Bois, Communist,
[3:03:31.560 --> 3:03:38.320]  all of them. And let me tell you, I've been around these leftist black leaders. And they'll
[3:03:38.320 --> 3:03:42.040]  pull you aside and start saying the most racist stuff about black people. And I'll be like,
[3:03:42.040 --> 3:03:46.520]  hey, this is some tests. I'm not against black people. They'll be like, well, you don't know
[3:03:46.520 --> 3:03:51.520]  how bad they are. You don't know how we got to get rid of the bad black people to raise
[3:03:51.520 --> 3:03:58.920]  up the good black people. I mean, these are sick freaks, man. And does that mean I like
[3:03:58.920 --> 3:04:03.240]  poison dumbed down hordes of white people or black people or third world populations
[3:04:03.240 --> 3:04:07.720]  coming across? No, they're a weapon against me, but I don't dehumanize them because they're
[3:04:07.720 --> 3:04:14.480]  not consciously trying to destroy me. It's the globalist playing us all. They are the
[3:04:14.480 --> 3:04:20.200]  orchestra controllers. They are the conductors. And it's the conductors I blame. It's the
[3:04:20.200 --> 3:04:33.240]  people in charge I blame. You could turn the black community around in like five seconds.
[3:04:33.240 --> 3:04:35.640]  You could turn every community around the five seconds of the real leadership. Humans
[3:04:35.640 --> 3:04:42.840]  do great things. But it's not there because the leadership they're taking over. You go
[3:04:42.840 --> 3:04:47.280]  back 120 years ago, Margaret Sanger went to the Rockefeller Foundation and she said these
[3:04:47.280 --> 3:04:50.880]  blacks have got their own communities, their own wealth, and they're not in our system.
[3:04:50.880 --> 3:04:56.040]  They had the lowest crime rate in the U.S., lowest out of wedlock level. They had the
[3:04:56.040 --> 3:05:00.720]  two most conservative communities in the U.S. were black people because that which doesn't
[3:05:00.720 --> 3:05:07.920]  kill you makes you stronger. Frederick Nietzsche was right. But as soon as the oppression was
[3:05:07.920 --> 3:05:12.960]  taken off the blacks, which was a bad thing, I'm not for the oppression, but they knew
[3:05:12.960 --> 3:05:17.520]  they were oppressed. You see, those that the Bible says that do not know they're oppressed
[3:05:17.520 --> 3:05:21.600]  are the greatest slaves. Those that do not have eyes to see or ears to hear. Those do
[3:05:21.600 --> 3:05:24.920]  not know they're oppressed. Well, the blacks knew they were oppressed. They learned to
[3:05:24.920 --> 3:05:30.600]  buy from their own people and do their own thing and not be a failure to show the system.
[3:05:30.600 --> 3:05:38.120]  And they were rising. And that couldn't be allowed. So Margaret Sanger waltzed in there
[3:05:38.120 --> 3:05:53.800]  and she bought off thousands of black leaders. And by 1960, she had them by the balls. And
[3:05:53.800 --> 3:06:00.000]  they're doing the same thing to everybody. So you look at what they've done to the blacks
[3:06:00.000 --> 3:06:03.120]  on average. A lot of people say, oh, look at those people. Look down your nose at them.
[3:06:03.120 --> 3:06:07.480]  They'll do that to you. They have done it to you. They're doing it to everybody. Same
[3:06:07.480 --> 3:06:11.400]  stuff going on the black household 50 years ago, 60 years ago is going on every household
[3:06:11.400 --> 3:06:21.840]  now. And when they're done, they're done. Black lives matter. What's their main mission? Destroy
[3:06:21.840 --> 3:06:26.520]  the nuclear family and teach black men to have their genitals cut off. That's their official
[3:06:26.520 --> 3:06:31.560]  policy. That's not a joke. Well, that's not what they want for black people. They want
[3:06:31.560 --> 3:06:38.160]  that for everybody. And as soon as people get that Hollywood doesn't love black people
[3:06:38.160 --> 3:06:41.480]  and as soon as we figure out they hide their whole agenda behind it, I mean, let me tell
[3:06:41.480 --> 3:06:48.200]  you, you turn on any telecom ad, any beer ad, any ad, because I'm happy to see nothing
[3:06:48.200 --> 3:06:52.840]  but black people on ads, but I turn on any channel. It's like 90% black people. I turn
[3:06:52.840 --> 3:06:57.080]  on everything because it's the whole global system. Oh, five G's here. We got black people
[3:06:57.080 --> 3:07:02.640]  pushing it. Oh, we got a vaccine. Black people are pushing it. That's not black people behind
[3:07:02.640 --> 3:07:10.000]  five G. That's not black people behind the vaccines because their first big targets
[3:07:10.000 --> 3:07:17.480]  Africa and black people and they want black people to think, man, I have really arrived.
[3:07:17.480 --> 3:07:23.520]  The system says I'm the best thing there is. And that's so you don't recognize what they're
[3:07:23.520 --> 3:07:33.080]  doing to you in their blue cities. It's disgusting and it's sick. And now you got all these weird
[3:07:33.080 --> 3:07:43.960]  ass white people saying they're black. Well, I could choose my identity and all this crap.
[3:07:43.960 --> 3:07:48.160]  You really think the system likes you, black people. They don't like anybody, including
[3:07:48.160 --> 3:07:53.000]  themselves. They want to post human world. And the sooner we figure that out, the sooner
[3:07:53.000 --> 3:07:57.600]  we can turn this around. Yeah, let's let's play the black NAACP leader. And then we'll
[3:07:57.600 --> 3:08:01.000]  show you one of the main rappers pushing the same crap and a couple of like a joke if you're
[3:08:01.000 --> 3:08:07.920]  awake. But if you're not awake, you're buying it. Here she is. I'm not asking what's in the
[3:08:07.920 --> 3:08:18.280]  infusion. I'm not looking up all of the ingredients in the infusion. I am sticking out my arm
[3:08:18.280 --> 3:08:24.960]  and I am taking the infusion. Now here's run DMC, Mr. Anti Establishment. Sounds like a
[3:08:24.960 --> 3:08:32.840]  joke ad, but he's reading the same script. She's reading. Here it is. We play that run
[3:08:32.840 --> 3:08:38.560]  DMC video. Oh, I'm sorry. I confuse you guys. Well, let's play it when we come back. Let's
[3:08:38.560 --> 3:08:43.880]  pull it in. It's unbelievable. All right, I promise. Everybody's been holding here patiently.
[3:08:43.880 --> 3:08:53.200]  Camilo is up next. Then we've got Bill. Then we got Roger. We got David. We got CD and
[3:08:53.200 --> 3:08:59.960]  we got Tammy and Gerald. We got Forest. We got Debbie. I'll go to every one of you before
[3:08:59.960 --> 3:09:04.480]  the show's over. I really appreciate you holding, but I went off on a whole rant about this.
[3:09:04.480 --> 3:09:13.280]  I mean, Bill Gates says he wants to kill all the black people. And he went and hired Oprah
[3:09:13.280 --> 3:09:20.680]  Wembley to run it. I mean, at a certain point, I just can't handle this anymore. Do you think
[3:09:20.680 --> 3:09:25.520]  God is going to forgive anybody that's involved in any of this? Because let me explain. I'm
[3:09:25.520 --> 3:09:29.200]  not sitting there defending black people because I'm some angel and I'm on a virtue signal
[3:09:29.200 --> 3:09:34.160]  to them. I'm telling you, man, they're going to kill everybody. Nobody's safe from this.
[3:09:34.160 --> 3:09:39.280]  And all you out there better wake your asses up and say no to it right damn now. But don't
[3:09:39.280 --> 3:09:47.640]  say you weren't warned. Do not say you were not warned. Stay with us.
[3:09:47.640 --> 3:09:52.560]  The people are awakening. They're taking control of their own environment. Cell phones are
[3:09:52.560 --> 3:09:58.360]  an amazing tool. Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld. But big tech, large corporations,
[3:09:58.360 --> 3:10:03.160]  hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai comms especially, are using this
[3:10:03.160 --> 3:10:08.060]  to steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to
[3:10:08.060 --> 3:10:12.720]  scoop up billions of people's data that can actually predict on record what's going to
[3:10:12.720 --> 3:10:19.480]  happen in mass movements. Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates
[3:10:19.480 --> 3:10:24.800]  their AI takeover. In their own words, they admit it. So I've been selling privacy pouches
[3:10:24.800 --> 3:10:28.400]  and pocket pockets and things like that for more than a decade. And now the units have
[3:10:28.400 --> 3:10:32.360]  gotten really lightweight. They're faraday cages. They just look like a cloth envelope.
[3:10:32.360 --> 3:10:37.000]  They work absolutely great. And it just gives you that security to have power over your
[3:10:37.000 --> 3:10:41.400]  data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother
[3:10:41.400 --> 3:10:47.200]  to know what you're up to because it's another business. Get yours at infowarstore.com today.

[3:11:50.720 --> 3:11:57.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:12:36.720 --> 3:12:40.120]  Let's hear from her. It's all a script. Here it is.
[3:12:40.120 --> 3:12:48.360]  I'm not asking what's in the infusion. I'm not looking up all of the ingredients in
[3:12:48.360 --> 3:12:55.120]  the infusion. I am sticking out my arm and I am taking the infusion.
[3:12:55.120 --> 3:13:00.920]  And there's Cuomo that killed 16,000 old people purposely sending COVID patients into the hospitals
[3:13:00.920 --> 3:13:05.720]  behind her looking like Count Dracula. There's Bill Gates giving little black kids polio.
[3:13:05.720 --> 3:13:11.560]  Show them Reuters. See that's too scary. The average person goes under Stockholm syndrome,
[3:13:11.560 --> 3:13:18.600]  particularly women. So let me explain how this works. They collapse the third world.
[3:13:18.600 --> 3:13:23.240]  They flood us with Africans, military aged men, Europe particularly. And then, yeah,
[3:13:23.240 --> 3:13:29.240]  I mean, you're in a town of 500 Germans. They put 2,000 military aged men, black men from
[3:13:29.240 --> 3:13:33.120]  a poor country there with no jobs at refugee center. They start raping and robbing you
[3:13:33.120 --> 3:13:38.840]  some of them. Now you hate black people. Now you want to annihilate them. And see, that's
[3:13:38.840 --> 3:13:43.680]  how the globalists are going to make us join them in the extermination of the third world.
[3:13:43.680 --> 3:13:48.200]  That's coming next. And I told you that 20 years ago, they release a virus, do lockdowns
[3:13:48.200 --> 3:13:53.400]  phase one, the stronger virus, bigger lockdowns, flood us with the third world, use that crisis
[3:13:53.400 --> 3:13:59.240]  to make us submit to tyranny. And then we'll be so overwhelmed by foreign invasion, we'll
[3:13:59.240 --> 3:14:03.240]  all just quietly go along with the race specific weapon that wipes everybody out. I've told
[3:14:03.240 --> 3:14:08.520]  you that probably 500 times the last 20 years. And a lot of it wasn't in documents. I foresaw
[3:14:08.520 --> 3:14:12.600]  the enemy operation. Now it's in the document. So I guess at a certain level, I did because
[3:14:12.600 --> 3:14:21.400]  it's chess. You see, checkers would be, France wants to bring in alone 230 million Africans
[3:14:21.400 --> 3:14:26.880]  into France. France is only 80 million people. 90 million people. I forget what's population
[3:14:26.880 --> 3:14:31.920]  of France. 120 I forget. That's going to cause a giant war. Those people are tribal
[3:14:31.920 --> 3:14:36.160]  base, man. One African tribe's killing the next. Used to be the half-toxed McCoys. Two
[3:14:36.160 --> 3:14:39.280]  different groups would kill each other out west. White people kill each other. That's
[3:14:39.280 --> 3:14:44.000]  how people are. By the way, we're supposed to be territorial or we don't have nothing.
[3:14:44.000 --> 3:14:51.320]  But does that mean you really want to shoot blacks up and poison them and kill them? No.
[3:14:51.320 --> 3:14:56.960]  We've got to get at the chess level of this and realize the larger situation. This is
[3:14:56.960 --> 3:14:59.640]  his three-day chess we're playing. All right, I'm going to go to your calls. We've got three
[3:14:59.640 --> 3:15:04.560]  segments left. I appreciate you all holding patiently. Who's been home the longest? Who
[3:15:04.560 --> 3:15:12.200]  is that? That would be Roger in FEMA region nine, then Camilo. Go ahead, Roger. Thanks
[3:15:12.200 --> 3:15:17.120]  for holding. Good afternoon, Alex. Welcome, sir. First
[3:15:17.120 --> 3:15:22.520]  time caller, long-time listener. I'm going to get to the point. Six hours ago, the box
[3:15:22.520 --> 3:15:28.640]  business news, I know they're propaganda media. I got a couple topics. The governor down
[3:15:28.640 --> 3:15:34.960]  in Hila Bend just declared a state of emergency for his town. Now, the reason why? The bus
[3:15:34.960 --> 3:15:41.200]  loads of illegals are coming in. The migrant crisis has started. These are military age
[3:15:41.200 --> 3:15:47.400]  men. I have a friend that was doing security. He was putting in cameras all down along the
[3:15:47.400 --> 3:15:52.520]  border this last year and as of 2019 as well. And he told me that there's a big old storm
[3:15:52.520 --> 3:16:01.160]  coming and it's not nice. You described it before, military age men, but they got women
[3:16:01.160 --> 3:16:06.720]  as well. So as of lately, keeping an eye out and listening to you for a long time, spreading
[3:16:06.720 --> 3:16:11.760]  band-op video everywhere I go, don't wear a mask, not taking the vaccine, I'm tired
[3:16:11.760 --> 3:16:18.200]  of the new world order. So they now have, I guess, their operatives, sleeper cells,
[3:16:18.200 --> 3:16:22.520]  you call them, but they're using women and children as the disguise saying they're out
[3:16:22.520 --> 3:16:28.360]  of gas, they need your help. And that's why Saki said, bring a 10-year-old. Now, we just
[3:16:28.360 --> 3:16:32.720]  showed footage of Trump four years ago putting up barbed wire, stopping the flood, which
[3:16:32.720 --> 3:16:37.520]  stops the collapse and stops the crisis. Instead now, it's all gone and Biden said,
[3:16:37.520 --> 3:16:42.360]  you need to surge the border. Our president says, surge the border to bring down America.
[3:16:42.360 --> 3:16:46.880]  If that isn't impeachable, I don't know what is, brother. He's not a president. He is
[3:16:46.880 --> 3:16:52.600]  a piece of garbage filth. Like you said, he is a puppet. I've seen this a long time.
[3:16:52.600 --> 3:16:55.800]  I've been awake. I love you. I love everything you do.
[3:16:55.800 --> 3:17:01.840]  Remember just four years ago, CNN was saying there was no surge. Remember that? Oh, there
[3:17:01.840 --> 3:17:07.920]  are no caravans. Remember that? As we don't need these walls, these walls are racist,
[3:17:07.920 --> 3:17:12.440]  but yet they're still doing it. They're still tearing them down. There are sections of the
[3:17:12.440 --> 3:17:17.200]  border like you covered earlier in the podcast. There are sections of the border that they
[3:17:17.200 --> 3:17:21.920]  only filled. They didn't fill the whole thing like Trump wanted. It's logic, and that's
[3:17:21.920 --> 3:17:26.760]  what the left lack is logic. I'm tired of it. What do we do as far as...
[3:17:26.760 --> 3:17:31.520]  Well, it's beyond that. The left just doesn't. The left doesn't spiritually, doesn't have
[3:17:31.520 --> 3:17:36.680]  common sense. And they side with evil. They have a mental disease. And so our problem
[3:17:36.680 --> 3:17:40.080]  isn't what color we are. The problem is what spirit we have in us. I appreciate your call,
[3:17:40.080 --> 3:17:45.280]  man. All right, let's talk to Camilo in New York. Thanks for holding. We really appreciate
[3:17:45.280 --> 3:17:46.280]  you. Go ahead.
[3:17:46.280 --> 3:17:48.280]  Alex Jones, man. God bless you.
[3:17:48.280 --> 3:17:49.280]  God bless you.
[3:17:49.280 --> 3:17:54.320]  I'm realizing that, you know, the Blasio talking about all these shootings that's happened
[3:17:54.320 --> 3:17:59.080]  and when he had the Asian vigil and, you know, the sympathizing with the Asian victims in
[3:17:59.080 --> 3:18:04.200]  Atlanta kind of reminds me of Chris and Canada talking about BLM and how they're trying to,
[3:18:04.200 --> 3:18:05.200]  you know, do this globally.
[3:18:05.200 --> 3:18:11.120]  It's just more division, yeah. I just feel like eventually they just, they're trying
[3:18:11.120 --> 3:18:16.880]  to push this Asian and anti-Asian phobia, whatever it is. And it's like, when you try
[3:18:16.880 --> 3:18:20.880]  to warn people of the CCP, they just hear that, you know what I mean? They, like, CCP
[3:18:20.880 --> 3:18:21.880]  hold it.
[3:18:21.880 --> 3:18:24.320]  I meant to say that last week. Back when the Clintons were giving missile cigarettes to China,
[3:18:24.320 --> 3:18:28.600]  they would say, it's racist to not give missiles to China. You're absolutely right. They're
[3:18:28.600 --> 3:18:32.640]  trying to use this whole Asian thing to hype it up so we can't criticize China. You're
[3:18:32.640 --> 3:18:33.640]  dead right.
[3:18:33.640 --> 3:18:38.000]  They're connecting them with the BLM, you know, basically just silence and not realizing,
[3:18:38.000 --> 3:18:44.120]  like you said before, where real slavery still exists then and where, like, you know, basically
[3:18:44.120 --> 3:18:47.680]  I have Asian friends and I try to tell them and I just feel like now it's just even more
[3:18:47.680 --> 3:18:52.840]  difficult because they're just looking at me like, you know, it's just, some hate rhetoric.
[3:18:52.840 --> 3:18:55.800]  Which is going to create even more division and more fights.
[3:18:55.800 --> 3:19:02.880]  Exactly. And yeah, I've been realizing that as well as earlier you were mentioning on
[3:19:02.880 --> 3:19:10.080]  the side note Yale and a pretty recommendation. I saw the Good Shepherd and realizing all the
[3:19:10.080 --> 3:19:14.400]  ritual that they do and it's crazy that Robert De Niro can make that movie and then criticize
[3:19:14.400 --> 3:19:18.360]  Trump and I don't, you know, I don't know how stuff gets so muddled up, you know, but
[3:19:18.360 --> 3:19:22.160]  if people are paying attention, you know, it's right there, you know, and the contradiction
[3:19:22.160 --> 3:19:25.240]  is right there. And like you said, it's all fake. They don't love black people. They don't
[3:19:25.240 --> 3:19:28.240]  love Asian people. They just use them properly. I'm up, you know, crazy.
[3:19:28.240 --> 3:19:31.320]  And at the end of the day, they want to get everybody because again, they make some of
[3:19:31.320 --> 3:19:35.640]  the elite white people think, oh, you're going to be part of the club. No. Now they admit
[3:19:35.640 --> 3:19:39.440]  it's a post human world. Whatever this is running things. I believe the Bible, it's
[3:19:39.440 --> 3:19:43.600]  the devil does not want any humans. The Bible tells us the devil comes to destroy God's
[3:19:43.600 --> 3:19:44.600]  creation.
[3:19:44.600 --> 3:19:50.440]  100% man. 100% is being shown every single day. And I found God through this. The last
[3:19:50.440 --> 3:19:55.480]  year I just, I found this show during the George Floyd's and you bought the George Floyd
[3:19:55.480 --> 3:19:58.880]  thing and you bought a lot of clarity and it's crazy. Everything is lining up, man.
[3:19:58.880 --> 3:20:02.720]  And we've been woken up for our true purpose. Well, God bless you, sir. Keep spreading the
[3:20:02.720 --> 3:20:07.560]  word Camilo. Thank you so much. And let me say this. I talk about this because this isn't
[3:20:07.560 --> 3:20:14.000]  BS. It's like God's language. We don't understand it and the devil doesn't understand it, but
[3:20:14.000 --> 3:20:18.160]  we're connected to it. The devil can't see it. See, the devil has his own wireless network.
[3:20:18.160 --> 3:20:22.440]  We have ours with God. I told you last week I was coming in here and I wanted the background
[3:20:22.440 --> 3:20:26.280]  of like earth from orbit. We do that maybe once or twice a year. They already had it
[3:20:26.280 --> 3:20:30.440]  up when I got here. They're like, okay, that's a coincidence. I was in Connecticut on a whole
[3:20:30.440 --> 3:20:35.960]  another deal. I can't talk about. And we go to Skilling Bones yesterday just randomly
[3:20:35.960 --> 3:20:39.400]  ever been there before at Yale and Rob, dude goes, Hey, you know, we went there on three
[3:20:39.400 --> 3:20:47.000]  to two and that's their big holy day. Everything. I didn't even think about it. What is that?
[3:20:47.000 --> 3:20:52.000]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:20:52.000 --> 3:20:58.280]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer, for financial support
[3:20:58.280 --> 3:21:02.560]  and for word of mouth. And then we're all this together. And you know, it gets old having
[3:21:02.560 --> 3:21:06.240]  to come to you and say, Hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[3:21:06.240 --> 3:21:09.680]  But it's true for the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty
[3:21:09.680 --> 3:21:14.320]  at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors. And they've harassed and
[3:21:14.320 --> 3:21:18.280]  almost shut down everybody else. They crippled all the other groups and we're still here.
[3:21:18.280 --> 3:21:22.800]  And as this whole new world order comes out and be open, our credibility is going up.
[3:21:22.800 --> 3:21:26.440]  That's why we've got to be taken off air. That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:21:26.440 --> 3:21:31.200]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still was I free. You can't have
[3:21:31.200 --> 3:21:35.520]  info wars has been proven right. Be on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[3:21:35.520 --> 3:21:39.920]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready. So thank you all and get an info
[3:21:39.920 --> 3:21:44.520]  wars.com. Get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements and so much more. They're wonderful
[3:21:44.520 --> 3:21:49.600]  products and they support the info. Thank you. I don't like coming to you and saying
[3:21:49.600 --> 3:21:53.600]  this could be our last broadcast. Hell, I've been on air 27 years and only the last year
[3:21:53.600 --> 3:21:57.600]  or so have I said that. But let me tell you, the new world orders breathe them down our
[3:21:57.600 --> 3:22:01.400]  neck. The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything
[3:22:01.400 --> 3:22:06.280]  they can to shut us down. So please pray to keep info wars on the air and please support

[3:22:21.160 --> 3:22:26.360]  help more than ever now. I want to keep fighting the globalist, but I can't do it if you don't

[3:23:28.480 --> 3:23:32.640]  It's incredible. It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest. It's so popular we

[3:23:48.280 --> 3:23:52.980]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point. It's very bittersweet. Everything we've talked
[3:23:52.980 --> 3:23:56.680]  about has happened just like we said it would. And now we have a lot of credibility, but
[3:23:56.680 --> 3:24:00.360]  I don't care about that. I care about beating the new world order. And it's because we have
[3:24:00.360 --> 3:24:04.720]  so much credibility. They can't allow us to stay on air much longer. And I don't have
[3:24:04.720 --> 3:24:08.080]  time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us. For a lot of reasons, I can't tell
[3:24:08.080 --> 3:24:12.120]  you what's going on. But let's just say this, we're going to see this through the end. We're
[3:24:12.120 --> 3:24:17.200]  going to stay on air as long as we can. So please pray for us and please buy the products
[3:24:17.200 --> 3:24:21.000]  and then forward store.com. They're great products. Plus, they fund the operation.
[3:24:21.000 --> 3:24:24.960]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great. Do they fund freedom?
[3:24:24.960 --> 3:24:29.880]  No, a lot of them don't. These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice.
[3:24:29.880 --> 3:24:34.280]  And the whole world's waking up and looking for truth. That's why the globalists are censoring.
[3:24:34.280 --> 3:24:38.320]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air. So while you're
[3:24:38.320 --> 3:24:41.840]  at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word. Download everything we've
[3:24:41.840 --> 3:24:45.680]  done you can find and save it. Because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[3:24:45.680 --> 3:24:50.640]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[3:24:50.640 --> 3:25:02.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:25:02.080 --> 3:25:06.160]  Oh my gosh, I just got showed by the boom operator, the most crazy, fouchy video. We're
[3:25:06.160 --> 3:25:11.520]  downloading it now. Glad for your next segment. I am your host, Alex Jones. We are live. Thanks
[3:25:11.520 --> 3:25:18.280]  to your support and God's will in the ATX broadcasting worldwide. Let's crank up some
[3:25:18.280 --> 3:25:25.280]  of this rom style.
[3:26:08.680 --> 3:26:17.360]  All right, let's get back to your phone calls and get serious here.
[3:26:17.360 --> 3:26:21.600]  Because the serious stuff's coming down. They want to disarm their slaves so bad, White
[3:26:21.600 --> 3:26:27.560]  House reportedly does not rule out executive orders to enact gun confiscation. And that's
[3:26:27.560 --> 3:26:31.760]  something he said before, but now it's back in the news today. Let's go ahead and race
[3:26:31.760 --> 3:26:40.760]  through your calls to get to all 10 of these calls or so. Let us now speak to Brett in
[3:26:40.760 --> 3:26:47.160]  Kansas. You're on the air. Welcome. Go ahead. Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. I just
[3:26:47.160 --> 3:26:52.360]  emailed the end of video to Owen. It was about what the House committee was speaking
[3:26:52.360 --> 3:26:57.800]  to the Federal Reserve and Secretary of Treasury today and pretty much they're just talking
[3:26:57.800 --> 3:27:03.520]  about just taking the mask off. Not like the real mask, but the metaphor. Yeah, taking
[3:27:03.520 --> 3:27:08.080]  the sheet mask off and the Big Bad Wolf sundry. Yeah, so they're talking about rolling out
[3:27:08.080 --> 3:27:12.600]  the digital ID for currency now since they're worried about Bitcoin being. Well, that is
[3:27:12.600 --> 3:27:17.760]  huge news. I'm sure Owen will cover in the war room. Send it to Rob D. R O B D. That's
[3:27:17.760 --> 3:27:23.840]  Rob do here at M4s, but R O B D. Just R O B D and M4s dot com. I want to see that. Tell
[3:27:23.840 --> 3:27:27.200]  us what he was saying. Because yeah, they're bringing in the world digital currency, world
[3:27:27.200 --> 3:27:31.440]  government. It's all here. Tell us what the Federal Reserve was saying. Yeah, the part
[3:27:31.440 --> 3:27:36.360]  that he was talking about, we need to reform the judicial branch pretty much to be able
[3:27:36.360 --> 3:27:42.800]  to unmask these people who are trying to, you know, use their money away that the government
[3:27:42.800 --> 3:27:46.840]  can't see it, but still has to be private. So citizens feel comfortable, but only the
[3:27:46.840 --> 3:27:51.280]  government. Oh, of course. Yeah, the banks want to enforce the digital control. That's
[3:27:51.280 --> 3:27:55.920]  the point of the social credit score is the banks enforce the government's eatings. Wow.
[3:27:55.920 --> 3:28:02.880]  So the Federal Reserve openly promotes a communist social credit score for Americans. Wow. What
[3:28:02.880 --> 3:28:06.480]  time did you send that email? And what was the subject names? We can get it right now
[3:28:06.480 --> 3:28:13.320]  on Ellen's email. It was, please watch. I forgot what the rest of it was, but just please
[3:28:13.320 --> 3:28:19.440]  watch. And I think it emails own as the info wars.com. I send it to that. But yeah, yeah,
[3:28:19.440 --> 3:28:22.760]  there it is right there. They want to unmask all the Bitcoin investors. And really, if
[3:28:22.760 --> 3:28:28.960]  you can unmask anybody, that means you can have a digital social credit score. Wow. What
[3:28:28.960 --> 3:28:33.600]  else are you talking about right now? Well, I mean, I wanted to talk to you about maybe
[3:28:33.600 --> 3:28:37.960]  a private meeting. I'd like to pay you like $5,000 for you and to sit down and me and
[3:28:37.960 --> 3:28:43.080]  my boys can present something to you that we think would really kind of counter trend.
[3:28:43.080 --> 3:28:46.960]  And it's not, well, you're nice to offer money to meet with me, but if I'm a politician,
[3:28:46.960 --> 3:28:50.520]  I start doing that, brother. I'm not going to have any time of the day. Listen, I love
[3:28:50.520 --> 3:28:54.880]  you. I appreciate it. Send your proposal to Owen. We need funding. We need funding outside
[3:28:54.880 --> 3:28:59.080]  our operation. The enemy's closing in on us, but that's maybe what's supposed to happen.
[3:28:59.080 --> 3:29:02.240]  Maybe I'm supposed to get blown up here. Not everybody makes it to the end of the movie.
[3:29:02.240 --> 3:29:05.720]  All right, Brett, I appreciate your calls. Seriously. I mean, it's all up to you guys
[3:29:05.720 --> 3:29:10.480]  were to stay on air and on. It's all up to God. I'm way past. I care too much. And it
[3:29:10.480 --> 3:29:14.120]  means I just can't care anymore. You know what I mean? You got nothing, nothing left
[3:29:14.120 --> 3:29:18.480]  to lose. And that ain't freedom. Like Janice Joplin said, freedom is just another name
[3:29:18.480 --> 3:29:22.280]  for nothing else to lose, folks. And baby, you ain't got freedom if you ain't got nothing
[3:29:22.280 --> 3:29:29.520]  to lose. All right, let's take another call here. Let us speak to somebody calls. Let's
[3:29:29.520 --> 3:29:32.680]  talk to David and Canada. David, go ahead, sir.
[3:29:32.680 --> 3:29:39.200]  Hi, Alex. I love you. I love everyone. We are the resistance. A girlfriend once told
[3:29:39.200 --> 3:29:45.040]  me, we've got to start at the root of the problem. And while I'm starting my own little
[3:29:45.040 --> 3:29:50.880]  way, I resist the mask wearing and I was angry, but then I saw your videos and especially
[3:29:50.880 --> 3:29:57.360]  the one with double news, how we have to inform the people because they're kind of confused
[3:29:57.360 --> 3:30:06.000]  and scared and try to try to give them a little bit of information in a nice way. But I'm
[3:30:06.000 --> 3:30:10.560]  under a little bit of oppression because some of the stores I walk into in here in Canada
[3:30:10.560 --> 3:30:16.720]  County, there's thing you can't come in without a mask. And well, if I want to next is going
[3:30:16.720 --> 3:30:20.600]  to be can't come in without a digital ID can't come without a vaccine can't come in unless
[3:30:20.600 --> 3:30:25.880]  JP Morgan says you can. This is it. And all these little people going along with it, we
[3:30:25.880 --> 3:30:29.280]  have to challenge them and get in their face in a loving way.
[3:30:29.280 --> 3:30:37.280]  Yes. But I'm getting frustrated myself. I'm strong, but I'm starting to, I see your videos
[3:30:37.280 --> 3:30:43.960]  of how to stay strong and what we can do. 2024, we need a massive political expression
[3:30:43.960 --> 3:30:44.960]  is needed.
[3:30:44.960 --> 3:30:48.800]  Well, everything the enemy does is divide us. And look, I'm tribal. I got red blood.
[3:30:48.800 --> 3:30:53.440]  Don't you think I see all this and get mad at groups? Then I go, that's my animal side.
[3:30:53.440 --> 3:30:57.880]  I had that programming to survive in the old times against the group attacking me, but
[3:30:57.880 --> 3:31:01.720]  the enemy is using that against us. And we have to still defend ourselves against groups
[3:31:01.720 --> 3:31:06.000]  or whatever. We have to be aware of the larger plan. That's the only way to defeat this.
[3:31:06.000 --> 3:31:10.760]  This is an alien attack. I don't go off UFOs or any of that. I mean, it's alien. The whole
[3:31:10.760 --> 3:31:14.800]  thing is rewrite humans, bring in world government, get rid of us. They want to kill everybody.
[3:31:14.800 --> 3:31:18.320]  They try to train us. Oh, we're just killing that group. Well, I don't care if they were
[3:31:18.320 --> 3:31:22.200]  just killing the African time against it. But the truth is they're killing everybody.
[3:31:22.200 --> 3:31:25.280]  Does that make sense?
[3:31:25.280 --> 3:31:32.560]  Alex, very, very positive video I watched computing forever. There was an individual,
[3:31:32.560 --> 3:31:37.480]  the guy put a phone in his car and he was stopped at a checkpoint in Ireland. And he
[3:31:37.480 --> 3:31:44.200]  was trying to explain to the guard that about the mask and everything. And the guard said
[3:31:44.200 --> 3:31:52.240]  to him, oh, the doctors need the masks for the surgery. Here's something to educate the
[3:31:52.240 --> 3:31:59.120]  people is in the bio labs where these viruses are being looked at, the people are wearing
[3:31:59.120 --> 3:32:00.640]  lab bio suits.
[3:32:00.640 --> 3:32:01.640]  Space suits.
[3:32:01.640 --> 3:32:06.760]  Yeah, let me explain what happened. They didn't know what was having a third of the people
[3:32:06.760 --> 3:32:11.640]  that had their arms and legs chopped off. And you get shot by a bullet in the civil war.
[3:32:11.640 --> 3:32:16.280]  They didn't know why a third of the people died of gangrene. So they learned because
[3:32:16.280 --> 3:32:21.160]  bacteria got into the hole, they didn't know about microbes in you cut it off and you basically
[3:32:21.160 --> 3:32:25.360]  bandage it and usually because there was enough blood flow, it cleans it out. They didn't
[3:32:25.360 --> 3:32:30.000]  know how to cauterize the wound, clean out the wound, any of that. So they started wearing
[3:32:30.000 --> 3:32:35.760]  masks in the civil war thinking maybe our spit smells, maybe there's something dirty
[3:32:35.760 --> 3:32:39.840]  in our mouths. Maybe there's vapors, they called them. You're just like, you know, the
[3:32:39.840 --> 3:32:43.280]  slavers stayed a mile offshore because they thought vapors were killing them. No, it was
[3:32:43.280 --> 3:32:48.080]  mosquitoes. But if you were a mile off, mosquitoes couldn't get you. And so it's the same thing.
[3:32:48.080 --> 3:32:51.400]  Listerine was invented. They started figuring that out at the end of the civil war to spray
[3:32:51.400 --> 3:32:57.200]  on wounds and suddenly it almost ended gangrene. And then antibiotics came out in World War
[3:32:57.200 --> 3:33:03.360]  II. So yeah, the mask was only something they started doing because they weren't sure what
[3:33:03.360 --> 3:33:07.920]  was happening. The masks are pointless unless you're a dentist or a doctor with a bunch
[3:33:07.920 --> 3:33:13.280]  of splattering blood. Then you wear a face visor because so much blood and bone is spewing
[3:33:13.280 --> 3:33:18.720]  out and a lot of people's teeth have pus shooting out of it. I was a dental assistant. For my
[3:33:18.720 --> 3:33:22.960]  dad, I can tell you, I mean, they weren't for their protection, not to have pus spray
[3:33:22.960 --> 3:33:27.920]  in your mouth. So that's why that's going on. Go ahead.
[3:33:27.920 --> 3:33:32.640]  I just want to say at the end, take too much time. You've got college, good college. I've
[3:33:32.640 --> 3:33:36.880]  read China's not a communist country, nor at all a socialist country, but a primitive
[3:33:36.880 --> 3:33:42.720]  Crowley capitalist country economically and a totalitarian dictatorship politically.
[3:33:42.720 --> 3:33:48.400]  No, that's it. China is a giant slave colony of the globalist. We used to leverage out the
[3:33:48.400 --> 3:33:51.600]  whole planet, let them economically through economic warfare, take over, aperture, call.
[3:33:51.600 --> 3:33:55.200]  All right, here's what's going to happen. We got one more 11 minute segment on the other
[3:33:55.200 --> 3:34:00.640]  side of the spring. I'm coming in without music. I'm going directly to your calls. I'm going to
[3:34:00.640 --> 3:34:05.440]  get to every one of you. I'm going to go to CD in Vegas. I'm going to go to Gerald in South
[3:34:05.440 --> 3:34:11.200]  Carolina. I'm going to go to Bill first. Forest Debbie, Josh, Tammy, we're going to get to
[3:34:11.200 --> 3:34:15.040]  everybody on the other side. I'm not going to plug on the other side. I'll just say it now.

[3:34:49.360 --> 3:34:56.240]  Kava Kava root supplement that is now available at infowarstore.com. Kava is one of the hottest new
[3:34:56.240 --> 3:35:00.960]  breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years
[3:35:00.960 --> 3:35:06.560]  in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects. According to ancient Samoan
[3:35:06.560 --> 3:35:12.720]  legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme
[3:35:12.720 --> 3:35:18.480]  ruler and creator of the universe. The Samoan people would drink Kava Tea during social gatherings
[3:35:18.480 --> 3:35:23.920]  and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little. Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many
[3:35:23.920 --> 3:35:30.240]  who enjoy its serious benefits. The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of
[3:35:30.240 --> 3:35:36.480]  not only Kava Kava, but other herbs including, but not limited to, German Kava Mill, organic
[3:35:36.480 --> 3:35:42.560]  skullcap, and balearion root. We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure
[3:35:42.560 --> 3:35:49.920]  yours by visiting infowarstore.com. Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[3:35:49.920 --> 3:35:55.760]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member
[3:35:55.760 --> 3:36:01.200]  suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from
[3:36:01.200 --> 3:36:08.080]  infowarstore.com. Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly
[3:36:08.080 --> 3:36:13.520]  lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque,
[3:36:13.520 --> 3:36:19.760]  and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[3:36:19.760 --> 3:36:27.040]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by
[3:36:27.040 --> 3:36:32.880]  increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family,
[3:36:32.880 --> 3:36:39.760]  and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[3:36:39.760 --> 3:36:45.680]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at infowarstore.com.
[3:36:45.680 --> 3:36:52.880]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on air, about looking at the world
[3:36:52.880 --> 3:36:57.040]  from the perspective of the globalists, that the public is so dumbed down that they don't care that
[3:36:57.040 --> 3:37:01.040]  we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them, that we're sterilizing them,
[3:37:01.040 --> 3:37:06.160]  that they deserve to be killed. Yes, that's the position of the globalists they play God,
[3:37:06.160 --> 3:37:11.680]  and they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to us. And I've told you
[3:37:11.680 --> 3:37:16.320]  that the globalists who tried to harm me, they try to get me to join them. But metaphysically,
[3:37:16.320 --> 3:37:22.080]  at a spiritual level, I have the Holy Spirit. I'm connection with God, and I know that God
[3:37:22.080 --> 3:37:27.760]  does not like that, so I cannot join the enemy. But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very,
[3:37:27.760 --> 3:37:31.920]  very mad at people that go along with the system, believing you're part of it, or believing you're
[3:37:31.920 --> 3:37:36.720]  getting power out of it. Whether you're just a steelworker, or a schoolteacher, or a Henry
[3:37:36.720 --> 3:37:43.040]  passenger, you're not God. And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is
[3:37:43.040 --> 3:37:47.920]  something that the real God of the universe doesn't like. And that's a fact. I actually bought this
[3:37:47.920 --> 3:37:54.400]  at Blocks, the UHS frequency. Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying
[3:37:54.400 --> 3:38:01.360]  on us, not just tracking and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well,
[3:38:01.360 --> 3:38:08.800]  with or without a battery. Now, with the InfoWars privacy pouch, you can go dark wherever you

[3:38:45.120 --> 3:38:53.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. All right, my friends.
[3:38:56.880 --> 3:39:01.280]  All right, we got 11 minutes to try to jam in seven phone calls. Anna and Shroyer's got big
[3:39:01.280 --> 3:39:05.680]  breaking news. And I promised to play a clip at the end of the show that I just saw 20 minutes ago,
[3:39:05.680 --> 3:39:09.280]  but we'll have to do it at the start of the war room. I will co-host with the one Shroyer at the
[3:39:09.280 --> 3:39:14.160]  beginning, right when it starts in like 10 minutes from now, at infowars.com for its last show.
[3:39:14.160 --> 3:39:18.880]  If your local station doesn't carry it, you can find the War Room with Owen Shroyer. This is Fauci
[3:39:18.880 --> 3:39:24.240]  and just the most fawning, sickening mind control you've ever seen. It's next level. That's coming
[3:39:24.240 --> 3:39:27.440]  up at the start of the war room here in just a few minutes, so no one will take over. But right
[3:39:27.440 --> 3:39:33.520]  now, let's finish up with these callers. Let's do it. Let's do it, as Emperor Palpatine says.
[3:39:33.520 --> 3:39:36.800]  Let's talk to Bill in Tennessee. Thanks for holding. You're a trooper. Go ahead.
[3:39:36.800 --> 3:39:44.160]  Alexander, Helper of Man. My brother from another mother.
[3:39:44.160 --> 3:39:45.840]  Yes, sir. Good to talk to you. What's on your mind, brother?
[3:39:47.120 --> 3:39:55.840]  My name, William, is from the old German helmet of Will. And it's bold protector, vigilant guardian.
[3:39:55.840 --> 3:40:02.160]  I think you and I have common ancestors. I have Jones ancestors who were among the first settlers
[3:40:02.160 --> 3:40:07.600]  of present-day Nashville, the Cumberland settlements. They came from Virginia.
[3:40:08.320 --> 3:40:13.520]  That's right. My Jones family came out of Virginia and then down into Alabama and then
[3:40:13.520 --> 3:40:19.280]  into Tennessee and then into Texas. That's right. Teddy Roosevelt wrote the winning of the West
[3:40:19.280 --> 3:40:26.800]  and he said that this settlement of the Cumberland settlements was the equivalent of the Mayflower.
[3:40:26.800 --> 3:40:33.760]  Well, wasn't that where like Daniel Boone came from? Patriots from Tennessee.
[3:40:36.160 --> 3:40:44.960]  Sam Houston, Davey Crockett, Daniel Boone. Yes. We went on to settle all parts of
[3:40:46.480 --> 3:40:51.120]  present-day United States. Different people than what we have today. Those were some really tough
[3:40:51.120 --> 3:41:01.520]  people. Yes, sir. Here locally in Knoxville a year ago, April 8th, we had a stabbing.
[3:41:02.720 --> 3:41:10.400]  You can find it on the Internet. Three pilot, that's a gas station. Three pilot employees killed
[3:41:10.400 --> 3:41:19.200]  in stabbing attack at Knoxville, I-40 truck stop. And of course, it got no covers because it was a knife.
[3:41:19.200 --> 3:41:26.400]  Well, and yes, and then they had a article on the front page of the local newspaper,
[3:41:26.400 --> 3:41:32.320]  a rag, the Knoxville News Sentinel under the leadership of the editor, Joel Christopher.
[3:41:32.320 --> 3:41:40.000]  I wouldn't wipe my rear end with it. They gave a front page coverage to the mother
[3:41:40.000 --> 3:41:51.600]  of the stabbing stabber. And she said that it was not possible that he could have done what he did.
[3:41:51.600 --> 3:41:54.320]  So why are we not hearing about it? What is the racial makeup?
[3:41:55.840 --> 3:42:01.120]  He was of Middle Eastern descent. Bingo. Yeah. If a Muslim doesn't think, well,
[3:42:01.120 --> 3:42:05.040]  who else wants to stab three women? I mean, 90% of the time, it's going to be a Muslim. Let's
[3:42:05.040 --> 3:42:08.640]  just say it. I'm not against old mussels, but give me a break, man. They got a thing about
[3:42:08.640 --> 3:42:14.960]  killing women. And Alex, they went on to have follow up articles on the front page of the local
[3:42:14.960 --> 3:42:23.440]  newspaper rag. And they said that the people who stopped him, who killed him and stopped him from
[3:42:23.440 --> 3:42:32.960]  killing people were investigated and cleared of any wrongdoing. Yeah, they had an article at Yale
[3:42:32.960 --> 3:42:38.240]  saying, should I be arrested for being at Yale? Wow, I'm glad you called it. No, about this.
[3:42:38.240 --> 3:42:42.960]  We're pulling the articles up now. So Islamic stabs and kills three women because he hates,
[3:42:42.960 --> 3:42:48.080]  you know, seeing women out free. And then the media calls him a victim. Holy mackerel. Bill,
[3:42:48.080 --> 3:42:51.760]  I got to jump and I'm glad you called. Let's know about that. Wow. This is the stuff going on
[3:42:51.760 --> 3:42:55.680]  everywhere we never heard about folks. Another Islamic attack they're covering up. Wow, we'll
[3:42:55.680 --> 3:42:59.120]  be covering that on the war room today. You can bet your bottom dollar. Print me that article,
[3:42:59.120 --> 3:43:03.760]  guys. Thank you. Get the newscast. Wow, these are these liberals are sick freaks. The guy that
[3:43:03.760 --> 3:43:08.400]  did it's a sick freak Gerald in South Carolina. Go ahead. You're on the air trying to move quicker.
[3:43:08.400 --> 3:43:15.760]  Hey, Alex. Welcome. Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason
[3:43:15.760 --> 3:43:20.560]  in amongst all this stupidity. Brother, I'm trying and we're all this together.
[3:43:21.840 --> 3:43:26.480]  You're nailing it right on the head. Wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold
[3:43:26.480 --> 3:43:37.600]  of you for a year. Okay. I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll
[3:43:37.600 --> 3:43:46.000]  never go away. Living defense saved my life. They had me on antibiotics for two years that
[3:43:46.000 --> 3:43:55.040]  almost killed me. Living defense brought me back. I wanted to just quote from the Bible,
[3:43:55.040 --> 3:44:03.200]  Jesus is saying as to where we are right now. Then they shall deliver you up. This is Matthew 24,
[3:44:04.480 --> 3:44:13.440]  verse nine. Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be
[3:44:13.440 --> 3:44:21.680]  hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many many be offended and shall betray one
[3:44:21.680 --> 3:44:27.040]  another and shall hate one another. That's right where we're at, brother. That's because
[3:44:27.040 --> 3:44:31.520]  God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates
[3:44:31.520 --> 3:44:38.960]  it because God created this country. Alex, real quick before I go, my wife and I are working up a
[3:44:38.960 --> 3:44:47.200]  video to show about these target biologics. Some of them are even being made by the producers of
[3:44:47.200 --> 3:44:55.280]  the COVID shot. I will not call it a vaccine. We'll send it to us, brother. Anything else?
[3:44:55.280 --> 3:45:01.520]  Soon as we get it edited. Send it to showtipsimplewars.com and we're working around the clock to try to
[3:45:01.520 --> 3:45:04.800]  get all this great material you send us. If you don't see us cover what you send, it's because
[3:45:04.800 --> 3:45:09.360]  we got overwhelmed. We love it and don't just count on us. If you send us something,
[3:45:09.360 --> 3:45:13.840]  send it to Project Veritas, send it to everybody to make sure it gets out. Don't ever think
[3:45:13.840 --> 3:45:19.840]  that we're in competition with anybody like Tucker Carlson or James O'Keefe or anybody.
[3:45:20.480 --> 3:45:26.880]  It's the opposite. We are absolutely aligned with freedom and we are at war with the globalists.
[3:45:26.880 --> 3:45:31.600]  This is not a regular talk show. It's not about ratings. It's not about any of that. It's about
[3:45:31.600 --> 3:45:35.920]  victory over the enemy. We are way past all that a long time ago. I've never been part of that,
[3:45:35.920 --> 3:45:42.880]  but I tell you, I feel sorry for the globalists because I can feel evil rising, but God, every
[3:45:42.880 --> 3:45:49.280]  time the devil ups the ante, God rates the ante. I can just feel God's power like a big, giant
[3:45:50.240 --> 3:45:57.520]  dynamo, a huge power plant just firing up like a volcano. It's awesome. I'm not scared of the
[3:45:57.520 --> 3:46:02.320]  Satanists, man. I'm telling you right. I'm not scared of them. I can feel God's presence. I want
[3:46:02.320 --> 3:46:08.400]  you to get CD, Tammy, Josh, Debbie, and Forrest. We have the same phone system. Transfer them over
[3:46:08.400 --> 3:46:13.360]  there. I'm going to go co-host the first 30 minutes. We're going to air this incredible Fauci video
[3:46:13.360 --> 3:46:17.200]  that illustrates what our enemy is, and I'm going to take those five phone calls with Owen,
[3:46:17.200 --> 3:46:21.440]  and I'm going to let Owen do a great job hosting the show himself. But let's speaking of Owen
[3:46:21.440 --> 3:46:26.480]  Shroyer. I'll be hosting the first 30 minutes with him of the War Room. He hosted part of the
[3:46:26.480 --> 3:46:31.680]  first of my show today when my flight was delayed, but we got in about an hour late and I got here.
[3:46:31.680 --> 3:46:35.200]  Owen, I think you've got a full show lined up. Owen Shroyer on the War Room,
[3:46:35.200 --> 3:46:39.680]  3 to 6 p.m. Central tells what you got coming up. Well, I don't even know if I can do it in this
[3:46:39.680 --> 3:46:45.040]  short time, but we've obviously got the latest with the shooter in Colorado, how the media and
[3:46:45.040 --> 3:46:51.680]  the Democrat Party lied about that. Now they're trying to walk back their lies. We also have China
[3:46:51.680 --> 3:46:56.320]  basically telling the United States like they did in that meeting, Alex, that you're done. Your
[3:46:56.320 --> 3:46:59.920]  politicians are corrupt. Your media is corrupt. We own you. Don't come to us as a position of power.
[3:46:59.920 --> 3:47:04.560]  We own you. A total embarrassment on the world stage. We've got more on that. We've got more
[3:47:04.560 --> 3:47:11.600]  nonsense with the vaccines and the fake pandemic. That seems to never end. And we also have the
[3:47:11.600 --> 3:47:17.120]  liberals, Democrat agenda right now. They want to make DC a statehood. They're stealing a seat
[3:47:17.120 --> 3:47:21.040]  in Iowa right now that a Republican won. They're just saying, no, we're just going to steal that
[3:47:21.040 --> 3:47:24.640]  seat. We're not going to take it. And then without any vote, without any announcing,
[3:47:25.280 --> 3:47:31.200]  the Biden administration is now stationing troops and occupying Syria. So they just thought,
[3:47:31.200 --> 3:47:34.960]  we're just going to occupy Syria now. We can't get anything to be done in our southern border,
[3:47:34.960 --> 3:47:41.040]  but we want to occupy Syria. Also, Alex, the Biden administration agenda to have
[3:47:41.840 --> 3:47:48.800]  children coming into the country alone, children coming in alone. We've now got mainstream news
[3:47:48.800 --> 3:47:54.080]  stories. Through hundreds of miles of the most dangerous place in the world is northern Mexico
[3:47:54.080 --> 3:47:59.520]  through coyotes. This is crimes against humanity. They're just unspeakable. This is insane.
[3:47:59.520 --> 3:48:04.800]  And so we're going to cover all that and more. I've got a loaded news desk, maybe a record
[3:48:04.800 --> 3:48:08.960]  news desk here today, Alex. So we'll be seeing you in a T minus five minutes.
[3:48:08.960 --> 3:48:12.000]  That's right. Well, yeah, I'm going to walk right over there and we're going to air
[3:48:12.640 --> 3:48:18.960]  this sickening Fauci worship video. And then it's cool with you because I swear these calls
[3:48:18.960 --> 3:48:21.760]  CD, Tammy, Josh, Debbie and Farris. We get to those.
[3:48:22.480 --> 3:48:24.480]  Yeah, let's bring them on. We got them on the board right here.
[3:48:24.480 --> 3:48:27.520]  We're going to get we're going to play this Biden clip. I'll be limited comment.
[3:48:27.520 --> 3:48:30.560]  Then I'm going to get directly to that because it's so important. Thank you, Troyer.
[3:48:31.680 --> 3:48:36.080]  And again, when I tell listeners that you and what you do in the fight against the globalist
[3:48:36.080 --> 3:48:40.000]  is king, that isn't rhetoric to make you feel good or feel important about yourself.
[3:48:40.000 --> 3:48:44.880]  His camera's a little lower than mine. So I'm going to say I am I am doing that because it's
[3:48:44.880 --> 3:48:52.960]  reality. This is a total war. And this is the globalist taking over and every day that we can
[3:48:52.960 --> 3:48:57.920]  stay on air, every day that we can be here is just gravy train.
[3:49:01.120 --> 3:49:03.840]  I don't want to let the globalist. I think they already figured it out.
[3:49:06.560 --> 3:49:11.600]  Do they know we've done for 27 years, everybody before us, all those seeds we planted that when
[3:49:11.600 --> 3:49:15.040]  they then bring the tyranny and everybody already knows the game plan out of beat them.
[3:49:15.040 --> 3:49:18.080]  I mean, here's the deal. Well, feel sorry for the new old order.
[3:49:18.080 --> 3:49:21.760]  I just because let me tell you, we're way ahead of them. They got the money, the power,
[3:49:21.760 --> 3:49:24.800]  they got Satan, they're going to launch their attack. It's going to be horrible.
[3:49:24.800 --> 3:49:28.560]  It's going to be terrible, but they're going to beg for their mommies before it's done.
[3:49:28.560 --> 3:49:32.560]  That's the end of the yellow show show until 11 a.m. tomorrow. Be sure and join Harris this
[3:49:32.560 --> 3:49:55.200]  with weekday mornings with American Journal 8 a.m. empowers.com.
