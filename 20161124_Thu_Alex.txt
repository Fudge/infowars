[00:00.000 --> 00:11.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show civilization is based on win-win
[00:11.320 --> 00:19.240]  conquest is based on conquest that means sack the city a couple days there's no
[00:19.240 --> 00:23.360]  cool fountains there's no cool hot baths there's no cool you know restaurants
[00:23.360 --> 00:29.400]  there's no cool you know temples there's nothing you've wrecked the
[00:29.400 --> 00:32.840]  civilization okay you sack that you took control of it you're like cancer you
[00:32.840 --> 00:37.440]  killed it and we've always had a balance it's not a good balance but there's
[00:37.440 --> 00:41.280]  always been a balance between tyranny and liberty between renaissance and
[00:41.280 --> 00:45.240]  conquest and the globalist claimed oh we're bringing in the end of conquest
[00:45.240 --> 00:48.600]  we're gonna domesticate you we're gonna it's the opposite that's just so they
[00:48.600 --> 00:53.800]  can prey on us and have the ultimate conquest over the species the globalist
[00:53.800 --> 00:58.360]  acting like they're aliens or something I mean this is the craziest mental
[00:58.360 --> 01:00.960]  illness I've ever seen but of course you look at the elites they have the most
[01:00.960 --> 01:05.320]  unhappy kids highest rates of suicide they're not happy it's blowing back on
[01:05.320 --> 01:10.160]  them they think they're insulated from pissing on everybody no it's like at
[01:10.160 --> 01:13.560]  every level how much are you getting screwed right at every level if you
[01:13.560 --> 01:17.160]  think about the reality of it someone goes to we're talking about health so
[01:17.160 --> 01:20.280]  we'll get into this for a second someone goes to a store and I just saw I was at
[01:20.280 --> 01:24.600]  CVS to the day I saw someone checking out with a bowl of like ramen noodles and
[01:24.600 --> 01:28.600]  a Miller light okay and then they say oh what are you up to and he goes this is
[01:28.600 --> 01:33.160]  my dinner and it was like a dollar okay now these people want to save money
[01:33.160 --> 01:36.640]  people buy cheap stuff right but guess what it's the corporations and
[01:36.640 --> 01:39.640]  government bodies that allow the absolute junk to be in it in the first
[01:39.640 --> 01:43.560]  place they actually worry that to lower the quality of everything so you don't
[01:43.560 --> 01:47.000]  recognize and demand quality and they write white papers admitting it here's
[01:47.000 --> 01:50.960]  a perfect example in the 60s the McDonald's con artists movie coming out
[01:50.960 --> 01:55.120]  about him he said we won't need people to clean up we'll just put thank you and
[01:55.120 --> 01:59.080]  peer pressure throw your thing away claiming it keeps prices down instead
[01:59.080 --> 02:03.240]  it stops entry-level people and creates a culture where everything's dirty and
[02:03.240 --> 02:07.360]  falling apart it's the same deal we get what we demand we take care of old people
[02:07.360 --> 02:11.360]  we hire 10 people we don't not take care of grandma and then hire 10 people like
[02:11.360 --> 02:15.960]  Bill Gates says he says kill grandma we'll hire 10 teachers bullcrap a guy
[02:15.960 --> 02:18.760]  that wants to kill your grandmother ain't gonna take care of you you dumb
[02:18.760 --> 02:23.280]  moron not kept side your head exactly it's like being honorable is what
[02:23.280 --> 02:26.920]  actually happens and actually grow society being honorable builds incredible
[02:26.920 --> 02:31.000]  civilizations empowering and then it creates spoiled brats yeah so how do
[02:31.000 --> 02:34.000]  you fix that paradox well I don't know how to fix paradox because the whole
[02:34.000 --> 02:38.640]  concept is now like look it used to be we've talked about this before okay you
[02:38.640 --> 02:41.680]  had to hunt for your food and you had to like go out and kill bears and defend
[02:41.680 --> 02:45.160]  yourself and build those were noble peopleizations and now it's like you're
[02:45.160 --> 02:48.600]  offended on Twitter and that's just as big of a deal to most people right so
[02:48.600 --> 02:53.000]  it's like we've as we progress so deeply and so greatly we've also fallen into
[02:53.000 --> 02:56.680]  complete just a shell of our as we have more information than ever yeah the
[02:56.680 --> 03:00.920]  average trendy says there's no world government cuz cuz NPR said so I think
[03:00.920 --> 03:04.800]  it's because we believe in this lie I think we believe in the lie that
[03:04.800 --> 03:09.800]  basically you know it turns into a it's like a farm right instead of like
[03:09.800 --> 03:13.320]  actually cultivating ideas and growing things it's it's true that people are
[03:13.320 --> 03:17.400]  actually now more treat like cattle because as we have this wealth and rich
[03:17.400 --> 03:20.720]  society whatever you want to call it which is all kind of a in shambles now
[03:20.720 --> 03:24.120]  too it's whoever is the most screwed up can dominate it it's whoever is the
[03:24.120 --> 03:27.800]  most corrupt whoever wants to milk the most people and like screw over
[03:27.800 --> 03:31.360]  everybody but then we have someone like Hillary Clinton who's the epitome and
[03:31.360 --> 03:36.360]  embodiment of all of that and somehow and then she let us we're greedy and
[03:36.360 --> 03:39.560]  bad because we want to build companies and hire people but we're bad for even
[03:39.560 --> 03:44.400]  talking about her issues and her crimes her true of crimes and again they
[03:44.400 --> 03:47.760]  try that thing briefly cuz I got you in a plug this this really you've been so
[03:47.760 --> 03:50.520]  excited about this last year developing and getting with all the big organic
[03:50.520 --> 03:54.760]  producers coming out with one of the biggest you know private organic firms
[03:54.760 --> 03:59.360]  in the country makes this I mean I'm really proud of this product if somebody
[03:59.360 --> 04:06.440]  wants the ultimate hair nails skin formula bio PCA 1995 I thought it was
[04:06.440 --> 04:09.880]  $39.95 I mean I guess we're gonna be discounted on that yeah we actually
[04:09.880 --> 04:14.200]  introductory pricing right now in 1995 because so that's all that I keep saying
[04:14.200 --> 04:17.600]  I have a hundred percent market that's not even 50% no no it's because so this
[04:17.600 --> 04:20.720]  is introductory you're the one running all this stuff so all this is the
[04:20.720 --> 04:23.880]  epitome of everything you just said instead of screwing people over instead
[04:23.880 --> 04:26.760]  of giving them junk we're gonna give them the actual best stuff for the lowest
[04:26.760 --> 04:30.200]  prices not BS it's not it's not some scam thing like oh we're gonna lowest
[04:30.200 --> 04:33.000]  prices it's the real deal and that's why we're impassioned by them that's where
[04:33.000 --> 04:37.120]  that's our religion yeah and then we want you to go show this to dermatologists
[04:37.120 --> 04:41.160]  and people around you they're gonna go what the hell this was 1995 because I

[05:31.840 --> 05:35.880]  Federal Reserve have over the American people or for that matter what kind of
[05:35.880 --> 05:40.640]  leverage do the Saudis have over our money will you be a slay or will you be

[08:12.680 --> 08:19.560]  rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty you're listening to the
[08:19.560 --> 08:25.120]  Alex Jones show well one of the best parts of having this job is I get to
[08:25.120 --> 08:29.800]  talk to great Americans like Lieutenant Colonel Tony Schaefer who still
[08:29.800 --> 08:34.440]  advises Congress and does a lot of other things that are obviously not public
[08:34.440 --> 08:41.520]  but it is just a super patriot who back after 9-11 testified to Congress in
[08:41.520 --> 08:44.600]  private and then also in public about how there was a stand-down to not kill
[08:44.600 --> 08:48.640]  bin Laden and 9-11 stand-down basically and Sybil Evans came out and backed up
[08:48.640 --> 08:51.240]  when he said he went through a lot they tried to prosecute him I tried to be
[08:51.240 --> 08:55.000]  false he smiled with the whole thing never really complained he's a best-selling
[08:55.000 --> 08:59.400]  author and he day one along with our other sources he didn't give us classified
[08:59.400 --> 09:03.600]  info but he pointed us where to look he got a lot of heat for that he came out
[09:03.600 --> 09:07.360]  and exposed what really happened at Benghazi and what he said four years ago
[09:07.360 --> 09:11.840]  here on the broadcast turned out to be dead-on so we'll give you his website
[09:11.840 --> 09:17.680]  his Twitter his Facebook in more but he's just one of the visible Patriots who
[09:17.680 --> 09:25.960]  ran the army-wide program against Al Qaeda he's one of the visible people like
[09:25.960 --> 09:30.280]  an iceberg tip out there in the different military groups and different
[09:30.280 --> 09:34.320]  agencies that are Patriots and I've always said our governments are biggest
[09:34.320 --> 09:38.120]  problem and our best asset in that America is still there
[09:38.120 --> 09:41.400]  Bill of Rights is still there good people are still there it's special
[09:41.400 --> 09:44.280]  interest that have hijacked the country though the problem but on average it's
[09:44.280 --> 09:48.960]  our military I'm not lionizing him it's just a fact that is the most awakened
[09:48.960 --> 09:51.920]  aware of what's happening and it's our military that said no to backing ISIS in
[09:51.920 --> 09:56.160]  Al Qaeda there's now basically forced a program to engage him and they're been
[09:56.160 --> 09:59.440]  they're being defeated a lot of that's you know super secret and it's very very
[09:59.440 --> 10:02.880]  fluid but we have seen the chairman of the Joint Chiefs come out and say we
[10:02.880 --> 10:06.680]  could put up in a fly zone but that will cause World War three so we've got a lot
[10:06.680 --> 10:10.200]  of jockeying going on with Obama and Hillary with the election four days out
[10:10.200 --> 10:13.600]  I appreciate him coming on to tell us as much as he can that isn't classified
[10:13.600 --> 10:18.480]  off open source of because I get really concerned that they might pull something
[10:18.480 --> 10:23.000]  as a distraction with this election they might they've been saber-rattling with
[10:23.000 --> 10:27.040]  Russia who I know four years after he told us about it Sy Hirsch Pulitzer
[10:27.040 --> 10:30.400]  Prize winner came out it was military to military was the headline in the London
[10:30.400 --> 10:34.680]  review of books and the Newarker magazine about how our military and it
[10:34.680 --> 10:38.680]  didn't engage in mutiny it just ignored Obama and Hillary and
[10:38.680 --> 10:43.520]  just did not aid ISIS and Al Qaeda and gave Russia the intel Obama was faced
[10:43.520 --> 10:47.120]  to get behind it after he was embarrassed this is unprecedented talk
[10:47.120 --> 10:51.040]  about books should be written no one really knows about this so Colonel
[10:51.040 --> 10:54.080]  Schaefer has been at the heart of this from the beginning he doesn't like to
[10:54.080 --> 10:57.080]  say that he doesn't want the attention because they they come after him but
[10:57.080 --> 11:01.120]  again he's one of those people like you talk about with Steve Pachennick Dr.
[11:01.120 --> 11:06.520]  Pachennick coming out and speaking out about the soft counter coup against the
[11:06.520 --> 11:10.840]  globalists trying to take over this country so my friend good to have you on
[11:10.840 --> 11:14.440]  I appreciate all you've done well thank you for having me it's good always an
[11:14.440 --> 11:19.160]  honor to speak to you and look you're spot-on I think there are patriots
[11:19.160 --> 11:23.640]  amongst us who are trying to do the best they can and ironically as you mentioned
[11:23.640 --> 11:28.640]  regarding able danger yes those who serve in a project have quietly gone back
[11:28.640 --> 11:33.000]  into service and are doing everything they can to protect the country I'm one
[11:33.000 --> 11:36.280]  of those like they they I don't believe there's an expiration date on our oath
[11:36.280 --> 11:40.000]  of office and I think that once you take that oath it's kind of a commitment to
[11:40.000 --> 11:44.440]  life and for life and you've got to take it seriously and to your point I was
[11:44.440 --> 11:49.840]  over since we last spoke I was over in England at University of Warwick on a
[11:49.840 --> 11:54.520]  panel and something called question time with Suzanne Evans by the way who's the
[11:54.520 --> 11:58.720]  spokesman for the Brexit movement and one of the notable things about my
[11:58.720 --> 12:02.480]  visit there and about the whole Brex situations I think there's some deep
[12:02.480 --> 12:08.480]  parallels that resulted from the Brexit vote and the people of England saying
[12:08.480 --> 12:13.560]  enough is enough of this global global idea and lack of accountability we
[12:13.560 --> 12:18.960]  don't believe we should be you know ruled by people in on the continent who are
[12:18.960 --> 12:23.520]  not accountable to our needs so I'd like to believe that the very thing you said
[12:23.520 --> 12:30.000]  is that there's an effort for people to recognize that their freedoms their
[12:30.000 --> 12:34.240]  ideals the the culture we live in where we teach independent thought
[12:34.240 --> 12:39.640]  independent action but accountability of action is being lost in this larger
[12:39.640 --> 12:44.460]  attempt to establish essentially a global perspective on everything and I
[12:44.460 --> 12:49.520]  think again the Brexit issue the Brexit vote went in the way of the
[12:49.520 --> 12:54.640]  independent minded and I think we are now facing a very similar set of choices
[12:54.640 --> 13:01.240]  between Ms. Clinton who is clearly pro open borders pro-world government lack
[13:01.240 --> 13:05.320]  of accountability I mean I don't know of anyone who's been less accountable in
[13:05.320 --> 13:10.120]  their entire life than Ms. Clinton versus Donald Trump who I think is actually
[13:10.120 --> 13:15.080]  as someone who's actually had to be someone who's worked who's developed
[13:15.080 --> 13:20.640]  who's seen results from his own sweat equity and has actually you know his
[13:20.640 --> 13:25.680]  success is ingrained is built into the landscape of New York Washington and
[13:25.680 --> 13:29.360]  yeah America so there's a very clear choice here to be made and I think it's
[13:29.360 --> 13:34.440]  one of the American people must make very careful now looking at this you
[13:34.440 --> 13:38.000]  obviously bumped the system early on to expose what happened and we're able to
[13:38.000 --> 13:42.440]  survive it most can't you were trailblazer in that looking now I was
[13:42.440 --> 13:48.080]  told a week before this latest FBI probe by a former high-level CIA operative
[13:48.080 --> 13:51.880]  I'll just leave it at that but but even beyond that even deep state and they
[13:51.880 --> 13:55.440]  said watch it's gonna be reopened the FBI is in rebellion we already knew that
[13:55.440 --> 13:58.720]  but he said watch the next week it happened he said then watch what happens
[13:58.720 --> 14:03.080]  with the NYPD and with this whole situation with Wiener it ties into
[14:03.080 --> 14:06.320]  Epstein and I'm seeing it all happening quite frankly I don't want to say it's
[14:06.320 --> 14:11.600]  frightening but to really realize this isn't talk this is a real move by
[14:11.600 --> 14:15.320]  patriots to let Hillary and the globalists know look you better watch
[14:15.320 --> 14:18.240]  out we're gonna bring everything out and I'm told there's even worse stuff
[14:18.240 --> 14:23.360]  they're about to bring out so I'm just wondering what these globalists that have
[14:23.360 --> 14:26.960]  hijacked the country are gonna do when they're face down by people that aren't
[14:26.960 --> 14:30.560]  scared of them and are basically calling their bluff I mean because this is just
[14:30.560 --> 14:33.840]  what I'm told is there is a literal war going on inside the government right
[14:33.840 --> 14:37.880]  now and I people that told me this I'm now seeing it manifest I mean it's
[14:37.880 --> 14:41.760]  confirmed well Alex you know we talked about this our last interview with my
[14:41.760 --> 14:45.480]  book talking about this very issue four years ago that it was coming so yeah I
[14:45.480 --> 14:49.440]  think several groups and I'm not unique I mean I'm one of the folks I think I
[14:49.440 --> 14:53.200]  picked up on this trend early that there's a great deal of people who have
[14:53.200 --> 15:02.000]  recognized this slow boiling frog effect of the loss of our rights this
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.880]  overabundance of taxation this overabundance of control and look I
[15:05.880 --> 15:09.080]  want to this I don't know if your audience is aware of this I actually have
[15:09.080 --> 15:11.840]  a degree in environmental studies I'm one of the few conservatives who actually
[15:11.840 --> 15:15.800]  has taken the time to study what the left puts out regarding climate change and
[15:15.800 --> 15:19.600]  that sort of thing and it's a complete grab of control it's all about grabbing
[15:19.600 --> 15:23.760]  control not saving humanity so I think there's been a movement behind the scenes
[15:23.760 --> 15:28.320]  both at the at the large level in the small level of people who have taken the
[15:28.320 --> 15:32.080]  oath of office and are taking their responsibilities very seriously so to
[15:32.080 --> 15:37.720]  your point regarding NYPD regarding the federal Bureau of
[15:37.720 --> 15:42.160]  Investigations work other things behind the scenes there are a lot of people who
[15:42.160 --> 15:47.840]  know exactly what's going on and Alex this WikiLeaks thing this ain't the
[15:47.840 --> 15:52.120]  Russians I think people start you know judge de Palatano my friend judge de
[15:52.120 --> 15:55.960]  Palatano did a video which I'll refer to you all to look at where he talks about
[15:55.960 --> 16:00.680]  the he believes that the source of all this is actually retired members of of
[16:00.680 --> 16:04.400]  our own government well I've been told by willing William many six months ago the
[16:04.400 --> 16:07.400]  former head of technical and I say that he knows that's the case now the former
[16:07.400 --> 16:10.800]  British ambassador was at a meeting in the US and was actually told who did it
[16:10.800 --> 16:13.800]  so you so I mean I know we don't want to actually let out who's done it because
[16:13.800 --> 16:17.520]  I thought folks actually know who but let me bring this up because why and I'm
[16:17.520 --> 16:20.360]  not saying this because you were in the army or in the army and the other
[16:20.360 --> 16:25.760]  services are great but why is it over and over again the army in this whole
[16:25.760 --> 16:30.400]  internal deal seems to be the main group resisting the globalist takeover I mean
[16:30.400 --> 16:35.000]  out of all the groups doing it it does seem to be the army and then also
[16:35.000 --> 16:38.480]  defense intelligence as a whole and general Flynn are at the heart of this
[16:38.480 --> 16:43.880]  resistance well you know I I don't I gotta tell you it's not just the army I
[16:43.880 --> 16:46.920]  think the Marines are behind this is a lot more than people acknowledge the
[16:46.920 --> 16:50.440]  Marines are a little bit smaller and and they're doing what they can but look at
[16:50.440 --> 16:57.080]  friendly Butler absolutely right so I think what we've seen here is that let
[16:57.080 --> 17:02.760]  me speak philosophically for a moment warriors truly seek not to go to war I
[17:02.760 --> 17:06.360]  think we are all very reluctant especially those who have seen the
[17:06.360 --> 17:11.720]  havoc and death which comes both to innocent and guilty in war and so I
[17:11.720 --> 17:16.160]  think all of us have recognized the need to try to forego and prevent conflict
[17:16.160 --> 17:19.840]  rather than embrace it and once you've come to that as an understanding you
[17:19.840 --> 17:25.400]  see politicians like Hillary Clinton who are the first to try to use the
[17:25.400 --> 17:31.160]  military for purposes of political jokes about it absolutely so I think you see
[17:31.160 --> 17:36.200]  both the brother-in-arms concept of all of us who have come through this trial by
[17:36.200 --> 17:42.640]  fire working to establish work at which I believe is in the best interest of the
[17:42.640 --> 17:46.320]  American people I'm sorry miss Clinton does not speak for the American people she
[17:46.320 --> 17:51.560]  does not speak for working together she actually works to to be very divisive
[17:51.560 --> 17:56.800]  very dismissive as well of the idea of doing the right things the American
[17:56.800 --> 18:03.720]  people so I think you see this it's like a tide a tide of concern a group of
[18:03.720 --> 18:08.440]  concerned that concerned military officers who have always recognized it
[18:08.440 --> 18:12.760]  is our responsibility to defend the country and let me say this in parallel
[18:12.760 --> 18:17.560]  both the Egyptian military and the Egyptian the the Pakistani military
[18:17.560 --> 18:21.840]  have been essentially set aside and designed to be the protectors of those
[18:21.840 --> 18:27.240]  of those constitutions the Egyptians as we saw have defended their government
[18:27.240 --> 18:31.480]  several times against the the extremists I mean they were moved President
[18:31.480 --> 18:35.520]  Morsi from power because he was my next point why would Hillary and Obama on
[18:35.520 --> 18:39.760]  record and CNN all back the Muslim brother of the space the al-qaeda light
[18:39.760 --> 18:43.400]  to blow up hundreds of churches to attack the government to destroy their
[18:43.400 --> 18:49.200]  economy why would we remove our allies there what what is behind this well
[18:49.200 --> 18:51.800]  that's an excellent question I just came out of a meeting I'm literally the same
[18:51.800 --> 18:55.320]  room as in the meeting regarding the Muslim brother is being a primary topic
[18:55.320 --> 18:59.800]  look the Muslim brother is a terrorist organization I met with the Egyptian
[18:59.800 --> 19:04.640]  chief of intelligence general al-tohimi on this back in 2013 and and Alex he
[19:04.640 --> 19:09.080]  made the point brilliantly that that the Muslim brotherhood is not simply an
[19:09.080 --> 19:13.880]  Egyptian problem is a global problem and they are the underlying foundation for
[19:13.880 --> 19:18.360]  al-qaeda in ISIS and other extremist groups they simply recruiting and
[19:18.360 --> 19:21.200]  funding arm they're the main group from my research room wrong here's a world
[19:21.200 --> 19:25.680]  expert aren't they men main group behind the invasion of Africa yeah absolutely
[19:25.680 --> 19:29.000]  they are doing everything they can to destabilize central government so what
[19:29.000 --> 19:33.680]  we recognize this and when you see miss Clinton and mr. Obama warming up to
[19:33.680 --> 19:36.760]  them you you need to ask the hard questions we've asked these hard
[19:36.760 --> 19:41.120]  questions members of Congress I you know I deal with my friend Louie Gohmert all
[19:41.120 --> 19:44.240]  the time on this Louie is completely correct in his assessment that there are
[19:44.240 --> 19:50.080]  issues that we have to defend and and and work that are literally let's
[19:50.080 --> 19:54.720]  expand on that I mean Google brags that five years ago they helped quarterback
[19:54.720 --> 19:59.840]  with the intelligence with the with the electronic signals to manipulate and
[19:59.840 --> 20:04.120]  fund the Arab Spring and launch it so what who are the elements in our
[20:04.120 --> 20:06.880]  government I know you know this I like you talk about it that are actually
[20:06.880 --> 20:10.840]  behind a Muslim brotherhood takeover the Middle East ally with Saudi Arabia what
[20:10.840 --> 20:15.800]  type of insane the group does that one of the most the same things I know
[20:15.800 --> 20:19.080]  directly is that this guy named Jim Clapper the director of national
[20:19.080 --> 20:24.000]  intelligence actually opened an office of outreach within the OD ni I don't think
[20:24.000 --> 20:27.200]  about this Alex the office of the central office of our intelligence
[20:27.200 --> 20:31.800]  community opens an office of outreach to work with them that's how insane this
[20:31.800 --> 20:35.440]  guy and Mike Flynn our friend Mike you know Mike we've talked about this Mike
[20:35.440 --> 20:40.520]  is publicly acknowledged he was ordered to send arms into Syria to help arm the
[20:40.520 --> 20:44.720]  the elements which were supposed to be resisting and helping remove President
[20:44.720 --> 20:48.840]  Assad from power but it turned out that those arms went to Muslim brotherhood
[20:48.840 --> 20:53.280]  and other elements which were the precursors of ISIS so again and Mike
[20:53.280 --> 20:57.160]  did not do this willingly he did it as he was ordered to do it so I think if you
[20:57.160 --> 21:03.360]  just simply Alex if you if you simply look at the facts without emotion there's
[21:03.360 --> 21:09.000]  a very clear leaning and support by our government for an organization which we
[21:09.000 --> 21:13.400]  know to be terrorists related and declared a terrorist organization by
[21:13.400 --> 21:16.920]  multiple Middle Eastern countries and that was the breaking point four years
[21:16.920 --> 21:20.040]  ago for our military as you said across the board the Marines the Army you name
[21:20.040 --> 21:24.280]  it and out of that now we see the overall resistance the attempt to bring
[21:24.280 --> 21:27.520]  these people into our country what is the point of bringing five million into
[21:27.520 --> 21:32.200]  Europe hundreds of thousands into the US Hillary wants a 550% increase why
[21:32.200 --> 21:36.000]  will we bring an 80% military age man for the most unstable places in the
[21:36.000 --> 21:40.720]  world well two reasons I mean she she has said publicly Ms. Clinton said
[21:40.720 --> 21:44.760]  public she really buys admirers at Angela Merkel well what does that tell
[21:44.760 --> 21:48.800]  you that Ms. Merkel is responsible for destabilizing Germany in a country that
[21:48.800 --> 21:55.040]  did not have the capacity she brought in a million plus refugees immigrants I
[21:55.040 --> 22:00.320]  call them immigrants this is actually a migration Alex this is exactly and and
[22:00.320 --> 22:04.280]  now Germany is destabilized I mean it is not the country it was just three years
[22:04.280 --> 22:08.040]  ago because of this onslaught so what does that tell you if Ms. Clinton is
[22:08.040 --> 22:12.040]  saying I want to do the same thing as Angela Merkel has done that's that's
[22:12.040 --> 22:16.480]  what she intends to do she's not bluffing she's not speaking so what is the
[22:16.480 --> 22:19.220]  end game of the socialists they just have such a hatred for the West they
[22:19.220 --> 22:24.640]  think hey it'll be fun let's bring in Europe wide five million jihadis that's
[22:24.640 --> 22:29.880]  what's gonna happen it does two things first it then gives the government more
[22:29.880 --> 22:34.660]  authority to quote-unquote do security oh my goodness you you know you we are
[22:34.660 --> 22:40.520]  insecure we have to protect you so Alex it's a it's a it's a version of the of
[22:40.520 --> 22:44.920]  the that disease where you injure your kids and then you want to be the one
[22:44.920 --> 22:49.160]  who solves them it's the moon child my proxy I had done it at the
[22:49.160 --> 22:53.280]  international level so what happens is you create this underclass who will
[22:53.280 --> 22:56.640]  always vote for you you these people come in their gratitude their gratitude
[22:56.640 --> 23:00.160]  is going to be with the party who brings them in the Democrats you then by that
[23:00.160 --> 23:03.640]  by doing it you create this permanent underclass and then at the same time
[23:03.640 --> 23:08.560]  you're creating chaos to the level that requires government intervention it
[23:08.560 --> 23:12.800]  requires DHS to expand its powers it requires the government to call for the
[23:12.800 --> 23:18.000]  federalization of local police forces it actually does a number of things they
[23:18.000 --> 23:21.640]  seek to do exactly so the radical Muslim threat is real but what liberal
[23:21.640 --> 23:24.920]  governments are bringing them in as the false flag to then take control of
[23:24.920 --> 23:27.240]  society now I've been asking the questions only got five minutes left
[23:27.240 --> 23:30.000]  and Colonel Schaefer you're the real expert on what's happening globally what
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.840]  is your gut level and what's the other intel you've got on this election I
[23:32.840 --> 23:36.240]  Trump's ahead all the battlegrounds the real polls they're doing over sampling
[23:36.240 --> 23:40.680]  of nine to 20 points on average about 12 for Hillary and I'm not just saying this
[23:40.680 --> 23:43.360]  is wishful thinking looks like a landslide for Trump even on the
[23:43.360 --> 23:47.820]  electoral college Democrats don't like her but she's still confident we got
[23:47.820 --> 23:51.280]  evidence of election fraud coming in what are your concerns about the election
[23:51.280 --> 23:55.440]  and other points there there's been study put forth the last couple days
[23:55.440 --> 23:59.280]  about how there's only been 31 instances of people being caught voting
[23:59.280 --> 24:03.280]  illegally Alex that's completely a false premise if people don't have IDs how
[24:03.280 --> 24:07.040]  do you verify if there's been fraud or not it's not possible you the reference
[24:07.040 --> 24:10.000]  group you're going to is not going to voluntarily tell you yeah I didn't have
[24:10.000 --> 24:15.200]  an ID and I voted twice it's not possible to determine there's no
[24:15.200 --> 24:19.440]  enforcement the Democrats admit they want angles to vote exactly so so this
[24:19.440 --> 24:22.920]  is the other issue so I think there's there's a great potential for that my
[24:22.920 --> 24:26.800]  advice to your audience use paper ballots make sure that you have a record a
[24:26.800 --> 24:31.280]  hard copy record I've been putting this out everybody I talked to go go the old
[24:31.280 --> 24:34.080]  fashion way until we can get the system fixed because there's all sorts of
[24:34.080 --> 24:36.880]  electronic manipulation can happen there's been instances I've seen where
[24:36.880 --> 24:41.440]  people push a button and it goes from the candidate so buyer beware secondly
[24:41.440 --> 24:45.280]  regarding the trend look a lot of friends of mine who have followed
[24:45.280 --> 24:50.120]  election trends for a long time see the shaping up just like the the the Carter
[24:50.120 --> 24:56.080]  Reagan run in 1980 a lot of the same dynamics are now at play and clearly
[24:56.080 --> 25:00.440]  Carter was seen as a an establishment candidate he was and there was a big
[25:00.440 --> 25:03.720]  backlash against the establishment candidate and clearly Trump is a big
[25:03.720 --> 25:07.760]  backlash against the establishment which is I think overdue so I think if
[25:07.760 --> 25:11.920]  things run the way I think others have predicted them and I tend to agree with
[25:11.920 --> 25:15.520]  these these views I think we may be seeing 1980 all over again right now I
[25:15.520 --> 25:20.160]  agree in the four minutes we've got left and I'm trying to pitch your book
[25:20.160 --> 25:24.240]  let's go back to it came out a few years ago I read it where you can't put
[25:24.240 --> 25:26.960]  obviously classified stuff in a non-fiction book I'm not saying you did
[25:26.960 --> 25:31.240]  that but I tell you wow did it come true how in the world did you write that
[25:31.240 --> 25:34.360]  book because four years ago I mean none of this was even on the radar for me at
[25:34.360 --> 25:41.240]  least well there's two things first Alex I saw as many did this rising Mexican
[25:41.240 --> 25:46.040]  nationalism which was attempting to essentially say that hey there's no
[25:46.040 --> 25:49.640]  difference with the America America and of Mexico we should and by the way there's
[25:49.640 --> 25:53.400]  this call they think all the zapatistas this movement to the calls for the
[25:53.400 --> 25:57.280]  return of the Southwest border states to Mexico I was one I just wanted right
[25:57.280 --> 26:01.960]  and so I yeah so I've seen I saw that as a potential weak point within our own
[26:01.960 --> 26:04.960]  thinking that people aren't thinking this thing through but I see these my
[26:04.960 --> 26:08.880]  these immigrants these migrants coming in demonstrating that they have no
[26:08.880 --> 26:12.080]  respect for our culture for our flag and that was something I just noted as
[26:12.080 --> 26:18.040]  someone who studies trends and and and the threats so I put that together with
[26:18.040 --> 26:22.960]  some of what we've seen happen regarding this globalist attitude you know
[26:22.960 --> 26:26.720]  the certain place that you visited I watched it with greater music when I
[26:26.720 --> 26:30.560]  wrote the book regarding meetings of the elites and having certain ideas of what
[26:30.560 --> 26:33.840]  they think is best and you put that together with some of the other things
[26:33.840 --> 26:37.680]  that I know have gone on in other places we turn it into a work of fiction but
[26:37.680 --> 26:41.760]  with that said we everything in that book is has elements of the truth embedded
[26:41.760 --> 26:45.480]  it's just we've rearranged it for purposes of both good reading but also as a
[26:45.480 --> 26:48.760]  warning so that was why I wrote the book Alex I told I told you at the time I
[26:48.760 --> 26:52.360]  think you were a bit skeptical but I said look this is this is supposed to be a
[26:52.360 --> 26:55.360]  warning to the American people that there are things that could happen that
[26:55.360 --> 26:58.840]  they need to be aware of and that was my interest you know I don't have a lot of
[26:58.840 --> 27:02.160]  time to write fiction is you know I'm very busy doing real things so when I
[27:02.160 --> 27:07.120]  when I write something I tend to do it for purposes of informing and frankly you
[27:07.120 --> 27:11.920]  and I both know the best way to inform sometimes is to entertain. I agree I'm going to say skeptical
[27:11.920 --> 27:14.760]  a few years ago when we talk about it it's not that I didn't believe what you were saying was
[27:14.760 --> 27:20.080]  accurate it's just it's so crazy that the elite run the US and they run Europe
[27:20.080 --> 27:24.320]  why do they want to wreck it if they're already in charge but they fundamentally
[27:24.320 --> 27:29.320]  don't like what it stands for they want to mount the head on the wall it's
[27:29.320 --> 27:33.960]  it's really a very I don't know vandalistic what do you call it
[27:33.960 --> 27:38.360]  psychologically I think it's it's something that they didn't create and
[27:38.360 --> 27:42.320]  and therefore they want to destroy for purposes of reestablishing it in their
[27:42.320 --> 27:49.240]  own image I mean it's a very ego ego driven very very egocentric dare I say
[27:49.240 --> 27:53.320]  narcissistic point of view I you know this is why you see President Obama
[27:53.320 --> 27:57.040]  apologizing for the good the American America's end over the past 200 years
[27:57.040 --> 28:01.240]  that's why you see miss Clinton saying that hey we're doing okay being number
[28:01.240 --> 28:04.520]  two really well let me tell you something you know as much as you and I
[28:04.520 --> 28:07.880]  agree I don't believe in aggressive war there are things we stand for as a
[28:07.880 --> 28:12.160]  nation which are is the is the goal stand regardless of the ones launching all
[28:12.160 --> 28:15.200]  the illegal wars that aren't right they're the ones here's the deal
[28:15.200 --> 28:18.320]  America's got a lot of problems but you look at the history we have been
[28:18.320 --> 28:23.080]  exceptional because of the liberty and freedom we need to expand that and so
[28:23.080 --> 28:27.000]  they sit and then they're the ones that are the worst managers ever and then
[28:27.000 --> 28:30.800]  they and then they blame America for what they've done it's incredible right
[28:30.800 --> 28:34.760]  absolutely that's the point is that they have gone to do everything they can to
[28:34.760 --> 28:39.920]  diminish our role our leadership and and frankly being a guidepost or beak in
[28:39.920 --> 28:44.840]  of how to live my close friend Bruce Fine has talked about how we should should
[28:44.840 --> 28:48.680]  be an example we wish to help people emulate not an example we wish to
[28:48.680 --> 28:53.080]  inflict on others and this is where we do differ with the with Hillary and the
[28:53.080 --> 28:56.960]  neocons some of the folks they wish to go on and invade and somehow believe you
[28:56.960 --> 29:00.000]  know going into Libby removing Gaddafi's gonna you're gonna see democracy
[29:00.000 --> 29:03.920]  spring forth it's not possible any culture has to make a deal with him
[29:03.920 --> 29:08.640]  having come out of the dark democratize and killing he's exactly dishonor is
[29:08.640 --> 29:11.840]  making the deal and setting him up you want to knock him out do it don't don't
[29:11.840 --> 29:15.800]  make a deal and stab him in the back and exactly what happened so this is one
[29:15.800 --> 29:19.160]  of those things I like to think we would agree upon we as the Americans have a
[29:19.160 --> 29:22.520]  great society based on the fact that we have as you said what makes us
[29:22.520 --> 29:26.200]  exceptional is the fact we have individual liberty we have the ability to
[29:26.200 --> 29:29.320]  think for ourselves and I think that's what we should be seeking to help others
[29:29.320 --> 29:33.360]  seek that for themselves and encouraging it we cannot right now we're out of time

[33:08.240 --> 33:14.640]  you live to the central Texas 18 million people and the heart of the resistance
[33:14.640 --> 33:20.360]  have watched on our video streams since yesterday patriots worldwide
[33:20.360 --> 33:26.640]  you're listening you're listening to the Alex Jones show and it's not that I'm
[33:26.640 --> 33:29.640]  that good it's that people are that hunger for freedom a very humble man
[33:29.640 --> 33:35.360]  who's about to join us Dr. Ron Paul former congressman the modern
[33:35.360 --> 33:39.080]  progenitor of the modern Liberty Movement that Donald Trump is driving
[33:39.080 --> 33:43.440]  right now and in control of he always says not about me I'm just a focal point
[33:43.440 --> 33:46.960]  of this he was known as Dr. No because he would never vote on things that weren't
[33:46.960 --> 33:52.120]  100% constitutional and I respect that but there's a paradox here we'll talk
[33:52.120 --> 33:55.320]  to him in one moment then they get into the whole waterfront where we go after
[33:55.320 --> 33:59.280]  this election and the great work he and his son and others are doing a campaign
[33:59.280 --> 34:03.000]  for Liberty but there's a paradox when the whole establishments against Donald
[34:03.000 --> 34:08.200]  Trump we know he's not perfect God far from it I wish he had Ron Paul's brain
[34:08.200 --> 34:13.400]  but but obviously the system doesn't want him so it's it's a major move
[34:13.400 --> 34:19.400]  against them and I just want to get his view on that out of the gates here in
[34:19.400 --> 34:22.440]  just a moment and I just love what they're doing with multimedia and all
[34:22.440 --> 34:26.240]  the stuff they've launched that's the future 18 million people just on our
[34:26.240 --> 34:33.320]  streams on Facebook and YouTube just since yesterday 18 million people folks I
[34:33.320 --> 34:36.360]  want to have a hundred million by tomorrow imagine how that you throw that
[34:36.360 --> 34:41.040]  in the face of CNN they're having peak ratings right now even though they've
[34:41.040 --> 34:44.600]  been plunging kind of a dead cat bounce they're only getting about a million
[34:44.600 --> 34:48.680]  people watching an hour they're a joke people again it's not that we're that
[34:48.680 --> 34:52.080]  good they're that bad so this is a referendum on the establishment and
[34:52.080 --> 34:55.360]  it's got to feel good to Ron Paul I'm gonna talk to him here in just one moment
[34:55.360 --> 34:58.800]  what a lonely guy 20 something years ago couldn't get one co-sponsored out of the
[34:58.800 --> 35:02.920]  Fed now it's a household word people know it's the enemy they understand it so

[37:48.360 --> 37:52.240]  the hour former congressman Ron Paul already introducing the omnibudsman of
[37:52.240 --> 37:56.200]  liberty doctor no the guy that never compromised with tyranny we appreciate
[37:56.200 --> 38:00.840]  you coming on with us thank you good to be with you Alex I can ask a lot of
[38:00.840 --> 38:06.120]  questions but just out of the gates what do you think of this election I think
[38:06.120 --> 38:10.960]  it's chaos I think it's a reflection of where we are economically speaking where
[38:10.960 --> 38:14.920]  we are monetarily speaking where we are on our foreign policy totally chaotic
[38:14.920 --> 38:18.760]  and people are angry and upset but I don't think they've quite figured out
[38:18.760 --> 38:23.080]  exactly where the problem is they don't think in philosophic terms they think in
[38:23.080 --> 38:27.080]  political terms the problem is not political the political chicanery that
[38:27.080 --> 38:31.840]  goes on as a reflection of bad philosophy whether it comes to economic
[38:31.840 --> 38:36.040]  policies this whole idea of Keynesian economics it's a failure just as
[38:36.040 --> 38:40.360]  socialism has failed our system has failed and people don't quite see it
[38:40.360 --> 38:45.440]  that way a inflation is a missfield the central banking ideas have failed and
[38:45.440 --> 38:50.800]  the foreign intervention has failed and yet they still think of details of well
[38:50.800 --> 38:54.520]  maybe we need a better manager maybe we ought to do it this way that way we
[38:54.520 --> 38:57.640]  shouldn't go into this country we should go into this other country we shouldn't
[38:57.640 --> 39:03.280]  spend so much money here no they missed the whole point that what we need is an
[39:03.280 --> 39:06.920]  understanding of what true liberty is all about and why that's an individual
[39:06.920 --> 39:12.000]  matter it's not collective and quite frankly I spent my time talking to young
[39:12.000 --> 39:16.600]  people because I think that's what we need we needed educated new generation
[39:16.600 --> 39:22.600]  that will be more intense on relying on liberty rather than relying on the
[39:22.600 --> 39:28.120]  political process where they're trying to get one advantage over another do you
[39:28.120 --> 39:33.400]  have any predictions for this election that we're now in well my prediction is
[39:33.400 --> 39:37.400]  that not a whole lot is going to change I think the momentum is so great there's
[39:37.400 --> 39:41.480]  a lot of good intentions out there but I think that the spending is going to
[39:41.480 --> 39:45.800]  continue I think the printing of money is going to continue the deficits are
[39:45.800 --> 39:49.960]  going to continue I've become cynical over the many decades I've been involved
[39:49.960 --> 39:54.960]  I mean even if you go back to the Ronald Reagan era I was so excited about that I
[39:54.960 --> 40:02.360]  was a spot supporter is in 1976 and yet when when he was in the debt went up the
[40:02.360 --> 40:06.760]  spending went up and you know when the high when the Congress finally was
[40:06.760 --> 40:11.840]  controlled by Republicans and the Senate and the presidency guess what we spent
[40:11.840 --> 40:15.720]  more money than a Democrat so I'm rather cynical about the whole thing the
[40:15.720 --> 40:19.760]  momentum is great and as much as we look toward and I certainly do look
[40:19.760 --> 40:24.360]  toward the positive side of the people waking up there's a lot of people out
[40:24.360 --> 40:30.200]  there that want government and I think the the the result of this election will
[40:30.200 --> 40:34.720]  be that probably 97% of the members of Congress are going to be a real
[40:34.720 --> 40:40.720]  elected you know it's going to be pretty much the status quo and I think we have
[40:40.720 --> 40:45.200]  more work to do in the intellectual sphere the understanding of economic
[40:45.200 --> 40:50.800]  policy the understanding of the nature of money and then that will eventually be
[40:50.800 --> 40:54.960]  reflected in our members of Congress you you mentioned in the introduction that
[40:54.960 --> 40:59.640]  I've done some work on the Federal Reserve but I I worked hard in the
[40:59.640 --> 41:03.320]  Congress I in especially when I interviewed the chairman of the Federal
[41:03.320 --> 41:08.960]  Reserve Board on various occasion but my my approach was to reach the people
[41:08.960 --> 41:13.560]  outside of Washington so it was changing their understanding of their minds
[41:13.560 --> 41:17.240]  it finally got to the Congressman and they finally voted for the you know at
[41:17.240 --> 41:20.600]  least in the house they voted we're starting to see reform that seemed
[41:20.600 --> 41:25.280]  impossible and the reason I go there is this I know you're a purist that's
[41:25.280 --> 41:28.520]  why I respect you and and you've always stuck by your guns and that's the way
[41:28.520 --> 41:32.280]  to do it but expanding on that I mean you've got the best voting record
[41:32.280 --> 41:36.320]  probably anybody you know since since Thomas Jefferson but if we expand on
[41:36.320 --> 41:41.040]  that just the incredible awakening people know about the TPP they know
[41:41.040 --> 41:43.960]  about globalism they know about vote rigging they know about the Federal
[41:43.960 --> 41:47.720]  Reserve what is it like to watch Trump and I know he's not perfect bad on
[41:47.720 --> 41:51.000]  tortures iPhones you know surveillance he doesn't get a lot of internet stuff
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.680]  I mean he admits he sees kind of a troglodyte when it comes to technology
[41:53.680 --> 41:58.080]  but what is it like to see the movement that Barry Goldwater and the Liberty
[41:58.080 --> 42:03.240]  Movement and you grew the American people grew undoubtedly Trump is a a a
[42:03.240 --> 42:07.000]  libertarian style insurrection into the Republican Party they see it as
[42:07.000 --> 42:09.600]  outside they're trying to reject it the libertarians have been taken over by
[42:09.600 --> 42:12.800]  the Democrats and Republicans they've got Johnson and the other guy well
[42:12.800 --> 42:17.280]  entered basically endorsing Hillary that's outrageous so all I'm saying is
[42:17.280 --> 42:22.200]  not an approval of a regular endorsement of Trump I'm saying what is it like for
[42:22.200 --> 42:27.320]  you to see the Liberty Movement basically in the hands of Trump with
[42:27.320 --> 42:30.760]  Breitbart and others and I think Breitbart are good folks intending to fight on
[42:30.760 --> 42:35.480]  even of this election stolen all I'm saying is co-existing as original
[42:35.480 --> 42:41.240]  patriots you know like yourself how do you see that co-existing with what's
[42:41.240 --> 42:46.520]  happened with Trump well you admit that he's not perfect and I'm in the
[42:46.520 --> 42:51.080]  business of trying to present the case for liberty and not water it down and
[42:51.080 --> 42:55.680]  those who are more involved in politics back and forth and they say well a
[42:55.680 --> 42:58.280]  little watering down a little except in a little bit of hope a little bit of
[42:58.280 --> 43:03.640]  prayer you know I don't have no any gripes with that but I think you have to
[43:03.640 --> 43:08.240]  be realistic that where are we today under those circumstances and if you
[43:08.240 --> 43:12.960]  water it down a little bit you know I used to say when I was campaigning they
[43:12.960 --> 43:17.720]  you know if if you talk about food stands for the rich or the poor and you
[43:17.720 --> 43:20.720]  say well there's people in need so we have to help them out but there's only
[43:20.720 --> 43:25.680]  three percent of the people who need help so let's say let's say let's give
[43:25.680 --> 43:28.960]  help to three percent of the people you give up a hundred percent of the
[43:28.960 --> 43:34.280]  principles that you're dealing with so that's why if you water it down a
[43:34.280 --> 43:38.280]  little bit and understand that if you're a political activist and you love this
[43:38.280 --> 43:43.920]  party stuff and you have high hopes I get people involved but the only benefit
[43:43.920 --> 43:47.800]  comes from people changing their minds and our understanding that people's
[43:47.800 --> 43:53.440]  attitudes have to be so sound that they reflect on the members of Congress I
[43:53.440 --> 43:58.000]  don't think the people in Congress you know in hopes that they will change
[43:58.000 --> 44:01.240]  their position a little bit that all of a sudden the people are going to wake up
[44:01.240 --> 44:05.920]  right now there's too many people you know I had a lot of young people came
[44:05.920 --> 44:10.440]  through that came out during my campaign but you know it was I was more
[44:10.440 --> 44:14.440]  discouraged by the fact that Bernie Sanders got bigger crowds and he's a
[44:14.440 --> 44:19.480]  socialist so I knew boy my work is cut out for myself you know there's this so
[44:19.480 --> 44:24.040]  I'm dealing in that area of changing people's minds because quite frankly I
[44:24.040 --> 44:29.840]  think that if we have an intellectual discussion between what the free market
[44:29.840 --> 44:34.200]  is and socialism that we can win this I also work under the impression that
[44:34.200 --> 44:38.800]  getting 51% to vote one way or the other isn't the important thing you need
[44:38.800 --> 44:43.320]  8% of the people who are the thought leaders in the country the people who
[44:43.320 --> 44:47.240]  write the books and write the magazine and people like you that have an access
[44:47.240 --> 44:53.600]  you know to to the public they're the ones who have to understand it so I am
[44:53.600 --> 44:58.760]  too discouraged about you know nitpicking and changing a thing here
[44:58.760 --> 45:03.360]  this policy here this except this this is in good a little protectionism doesn't
[45:03.360 --> 45:06.600]  hurt we've got to change the whole system we got to change the whole
[45:06.600 --> 45:10.560]  fraudulent system on Paula's we've got to change the minds minds of the people
[45:10.560 --> 45:15.160]  that's what's happened and you can only do that one person at a time Ron Paul
[45:15.160 --> 45:19.320]  Liberty report calm you've got so many great sides TV shows radio shows I hear
[45:19.320 --> 45:24.120]  it all over the radio it's wonderful to almost see you three or now that you're
[45:24.120 --> 45:29.280]  not in Congress than you were before to really educate yes and I and I feel good
[45:29.280 --> 45:34.480]  about it that you know there's still an audience you know most people when they
[45:34.480 --> 45:38.440]  leave Congress you know the Alex Jones of the world they don't call you up
[45:38.440 --> 45:42.840]  anymore but still there are people that are interested and I am pleased and I
[45:42.840 --> 45:46.200]  have to admit it that if they're interested in what I'm saying you know
[45:46.200 --> 45:52.000]  the most flattering thing that I had in Washington was I went my own way I
[45:52.000 --> 45:56.200]  didn't try to I think that I could fight with them and change their minds or give
[45:56.200 --> 46:00.520]  great speeches but I would vote if it were by if it happened to be by myself I
[46:00.520 --> 46:04.280]  would do it in a quiet steady way but every once in a while a member of
[46:04.280 --> 46:07.600]  Congress would come up and sit down beside me because I'd all be by myself
[46:07.600 --> 46:13.480]  voting and he would say why you do that which was a sincere question so one
[46:13.480 --> 46:16.960]  person at a time like that and a few of them change their ways and they become
[46:16.960 --> 46:20.960]  much more interested in that point you did something with no support you did
[46:20.960 --> 46:24.680]  something with no support in Congress and really change the paradigm to a great
[46:24.680 --> 46:27.480]  extent to at least have a national debate and that's why you know I model
[46:27.480 --> 46:32.760]  myself just just historically off seeing what you and others have done with the
[46:32.760 --> 46:37.400]  wind blowing in your face over time you end up turning the tables and getting
[46:37.400 --> 46:40.240]  back to Trump because it's obviously the big phenomenon the election right now
[46:40.240 --> 46:45.920]  the biggest reason I've supported him is so that I could also sit there and
[46:45.920 --> 46:49.200]  point out things that were wrong and I've seen Trump actually change when he
[46:49.200 --> 46:52.120]  sees something is wrong if it's actually genuine and not from the
[46:52.120 --> 46:56.280]  establishment but obviously looking at Trump because obviously people want to
[46:56.280 --> 46:59.680]  know what Ron Paul thinks about this the entire establishment the Communist
[46:59.680 --> 47:04.600]  Chinese the socialist Pope the Mexican presidents all the big corrupt
[47:04.600 --> 47:08.400]  combines the Republican Party machinery that has attacked you and try to
[47:08.400 --> 47:13.280]  destroy you I mean you know a man by his enemies and Dr. Paul Trump has the same
[47:13.280 --> 47:18.520]  enemies you had the same enemies I have and they are so opposed to him I think
[47:18.520 --> 47:21.080]  that's undoubtable so what do you think of that and what do you think that
[47:21.080 --> 47:27.240]  signifies well I think what you're doing is fine and dandy and you make those
[47:27.240 --> 47:31.720]  points and you can make inroads but my approach has been been different I take
[47:31.720 --> 47:35.120]  it out of the personalities I never wanted when I you bet you can't find
[47:35.120 --> 47:38.120]  anything I've ever sat on the house floor about oh you know the president
[47:38.120 --> 47:42.840]  United States is a bum or are saying the Democrats are you know the Paul and
[47:42.840 --> 47:46.840]  it's all the fall of the Democrat no I'm always going to be talking about
[47:46.840 --> 47:52.600]  changing people's minds about why printing money is lousy why fighting wars
[47:52.600 --> 47:57.360]  overseas is bad and not you're a gentleman who is who is reaching out
[47:57.360 --> 48:00.960]  to people trying to change them and Trump is more of a bull in a China cabinet
[48:00.960 --> 48:07.040]  I think that's the case and there I hopefully that there's room for both
[48:07.040 --> 48:12.240]  both ways of changing things because you know I sort of enjoy the idea though I
[48:12.240 --> 48:17.120]  have never became a Trump supporter I enjoyed the idea that right now we're
[48:17.120 --> 48:22.000]  winning on some of these issues one is that it's a little bit more popular to
[48:22.000 --> 48:27.000]  challenge political correctness than it was a few years ago and I think the
[48:27.000 --> 48:34.480]  American people are waking up they're so sick and tired of that is that Trump
[48:34.480 --> 48:38.760]  has taken what you built and others built and we built and magnified it there's
[48:38.760 --> 48:42.440]  some imperfections there but but I think I just heard you right you said I'm kind
[48:42.440 --> 48:46.120]  of a Trump supporter on the fact that he's made it okay to have free speech
[48:46.120 --> 48:52.320]  and stand up against the bullying of the PC Club okay well no I'm glad that has
[48:52.320 --> 48:57.600]  happened but I see it in a difference in a different sense because I use it in a
[48:57.600 --> 49:02.280]  different fashion I would say well who uses which bathroom is a private
[49:02.280 --> 49:06.840]  property issue we need to deal with the issue of privacy why do governments own
[49:06.840 --> 49:11.200]  these things why in the world would we be talking about this because people can't
[49:11.200 --> 49:15.400]  walk into our houses and decide to use the government involved on business
[49:15.400 --> 49:20.520]  should have whatever they want you want to have the same sex I want them I want
[49:20.520 --> 49:26.600]  them to use the total principle of freedom property rights for voluntary
[49:26.600 --> 49:30.440]  contracts non-aggression principle I want to always emphasize the
[49:30.440 --> 49:35.200]  philosophic underpinnings of what we're talking about and you're dealing you know
[49:35.200 --> 49:39.960]  one of the specifics and you will go a certain way politically but I've lost
[49:39.960 --> 49:44.320]  any enthusiasm for thinking that you know if we get a few more people in
[49:44.320 --> 49:48.840]  Congress next year we're gonna have a balanced budget now that is not gonna
[49:48.840 --> 49:52.320]  happen I never really believed it never went there with the intention went
[49:52.320 --> 49:55.760]  there as a surprise because I didn't think anybody would vote for me if I took
[49:55.760 --> 50:00.720]  this position of you know saying that government says should be very very
[50:00.720 --> 50:04.480]  small sure well you know Nigel Farage take on everybody you know who Nigel
[50:04.480 --> 50:09.640]  Farage is well sure sure and he said on air before that your work inspired him
[50:09.640 --> 50:12.960]  20 something years ago and that when a lot of folks he would he would he would
[50:12.960 --> 50:16.120]  go speak to an England back when their party was tiny were listeners of yours
[50:16.120 --> 50:20.840]  and listeners of mine so all I'm saying is it's got to feel good to know that
[50:20.840 --> 50:25.000]  you've affected elections in Europe you know that that that the libertarian ideas
[50:25.000 --> 50:28.080]  the Von Mies Institute that you've been quarterbacking or having big effects all
[50:28.080 --> 50:35.200]  I'm saying is Trump is basically at his core adopting all of that I don't think
[50:35.200 --> 50:38.440]  he's so much political as he is just kind of you know like a you know promoter
[50:38.440 --> 50:41.840]  where he agrees with you know a lot of folks he's around and says nice things
[50:41.840 --> 50:46.240]  to crowds he's with but at his core I know he really respects you he's told me
[50:46.240 --> 50:49.760]  that personally he said it in public and I'm sad that you know random he got in
[50:49.760 --> 50:52.000]  fights and things but both people did things were probably not too good but
[50:52.000 --> 50:55.920]  that happens in the political campaign all I'm saying is if a Donald Trump got
[50:55.920 --> 50:59.800]  elected and you had a free hand would you be an advisor would you be the head
[50:59.800 --> 51:04.720]  of the Treasury or are you done well now he's not going to because I'm dealing
[51:04.720 --> 51:10.040]  on a different level I'm dealing in the theoretical and the philosophic and I
[51:10.040 --> 51:15.280]  don't think he's there he picks up bits and pieces and he uses it and when it
[51:15.280 --> 51:19.560]  seems to be beneficial I guess he'll use it I mean if somebody asked me a
[51:19.560 --> 51:23.400]  question I'm not going to turn them down but just as you know I was pleased
[51:23.400 --> 51:27.880]  when I got one or two or three members of Congress asked me I know for a fact
[51:27.880 --> 51:30.920]  why didn't I didn't have the John I didn't have the John Bainers of the
[51:30.920 --> 51:35.280]  world come and say Ron I think what we need for you to be you know chairman of
[51:35.280 --> 51:39.360]  the committee no they had to work very hard to keep me ever from getting any
[51:39.360 --> 51:43.040]  no no Trump it's different what I'm telling you is I know now the inside
[51:43.040 --> 51:46.560]  baseball before he and ran gotten all those spats he was looking at Rand as a
[51:46.560 --> 51:50.760]  VP and I know for a fact he respects you and was wanting to talk to you about
[51:50.760 --> 51:55.680]  economic policy so I mean and it's not patronizing I'm telling you you know
[51:55.680 --> 51:59.400]  that Donald Trump really really really thinks you know what you're talking about
[51:59.400 --> 52:02.360]  and I get he's wrong on interest rates and things you know he's saying keep him
[52:02.360 --> 52:05.600]  low I think we have to say they should go up I mean obviously the point is he's
[52:05.600 --> 52:09.840]  open to it he really wants to make the country successful he understands we
[52:09.840 --> 52:13.720]  have unfair trade deals and I think that's why the elite are against him
[52:13.720 --> 52:19.720]  is he's not out to get the people he wants prosperity now Iran Paul you want
[52:19.720 --> 52:27.160]  prosperity yeah but that's not where I am I'm trying to change attitudes that
[52:27.160 --> 52:31.040]  would support him to do the right things rather than me saying well if I
[52:31.040 --> 52:34.520]  support Trump or say this and this and sort of all that that's a political thing
[52:34.520 --> 52:39.280]  what I want to do is go out and get people to understand you know exactly
[52:39.280 --> 52:43.000]  the philosophy behind it and why you have to reject the authoritarianism of
[52:43.000 --> 52:46.160]  the government and so when he's right on those issues he's gonna have more
[52:46.160 --> 52:49.880]  support it would be much more valuable for him to have support of tens of
[52:49.880 --> 52:53.760]  thousands of people that may have been educated you're not about the
[52:53.760 --> 52:59.200]  political you're all about the right philosophical economic move matter of
[52:59.200 --> 53:03.440]  fact I think it's 90% of everything that we do and I was in politics but I was in
[53:03.440 --> 53:07.840]  politics for participating in the educational opportunity that's also
[53:07.840 --> 53:12.360]  Alex the reason why I have a homeschooling organization nobody knows a
[53:12.360 --> 53:16.840]  whole lot to bring that up next take our children out of the system tell us
[53:16.840 --> 53:24.000]  about that well yes and Gary North and Tom Woods helped me start this and they
[53:24.000 --> 53:30.200]  have a fantastic thing going and quite frankly it's it's not gigantic it's we
[53:30.200 --> 53:34.080]  don't have the numbers that you have but systematically more and more the
[53:34.080 --> 53:38.400]  public school system is is terrible in this whole thing of political correctness
[53:38.400 --> 53:42.840]  it's all in the public system so I think more and more people I think if we lose
[53:42.840 --> 53:48.320]  our rights to property rights to have our private school system I mean then
[53:48.320 --> 53:52.560]  we're in real trouble as long as we have that and more and more people are
[53:52.560 --> 53:57.000]  going to come because people are sick of of the you know government school
[53:57.000 --> 54:01.120]  systems so that's where I'm optimistic and some people have told me that's
[54:01.120 --> 54:05.120]  probably one of the most positive things that I prove I'm doing it this by the way
[54:05.120 --> 54:09.120]  you say you're on your philosophy sure your own homeschooling deals got a lot
[54:09.120 --> 54:12.660]  of people signed up to the homeschooling movement itself is exploding folks can
[54:12.660 --> 54:16.480]  find out more at Ron Paul Liberty report dot-com let me ask you this then what
[54:16.480 --> 54:19.680]  is your gut on this election I mean he's ahead in battleground states they keep
[54:19.680 --> 54:24.280]  oversampling Democrats 10 15 20 points they've been caught in wiki leaks fixing
[54:24.280 --> 54:28.080]  polls getting questions beforehand rigging things we know a lot of Hickey
[54:28.080 --> 54:32.320]  Panky happen to you when you be winning a new Hampshire in places I mean what's
[54:32.320 --> 54:40.080]  your gut about the election tell you well I haven't relied on my god too much
[54:40.080 --> 54:46.200]  sure what's the analysis I look at the financial markets and unfortunately the
[54:46.200 --> 54:51.120]  financial markets this last couple days went against against Trump because you
[54:51.120 --> 54:54.560]  know the way they were responding how oh Hillary won something Hillary won something
[54:54.560 --> 54:59.440]  so therefore what he is so sad is that because it was interpreted here Hillary
[54:59.440 --> 55:05.120]  won something with the director of the FBI coming out that the markets which
[55:05.120 --> 55:09.240]  are supposed to be free markets and capitalism they responded with glee the
[55:09.240 --> 55:15.000]  stock market skyrocketed nearly 400 points that to me is sad and sad sad state
[55:15.000 --> 55:18.360]  of fair that shows the control but now there's some jitters now there's some
[55:18.360 --> 55:24.240]  jitters is my point so you're thinking Hillary when well right now I'm saying
[55:24.240 --> 55:31.400]  the markets think that I think that right now I'm not predicting I'm not
[55:31.400 --> 55:35.720]  betting any money I'm also I did a program today on my program I said the
[55:35.720 --> 55:40.320]  momentum I just try to describe where the momentum is after this election is
[55:40.320 --> 55:44.200]  over and I didn't pick a winner that we are still gonna spend more money we're
[55:44.200 --> 55:49.560]  gonna get bigger government taxes will not go down the troops won't agree but
[55:49.560 --> 55:52.920]  the awakening moment but the awakening momentum has never been bigger so let me
[55:52.920 --> 55:58.520]  ask you this in closing then Dr. Ron Paul's our guest looking at this I mean
[55:58.520 --> 56:03.960]  just looking at Hillary she's so bad she's so evil she wants war with Russia I
[56:03.960 --> 56:09.040]  mean just for world peace isn't it positive that Trump doesn't want war
[56:09.040 --> 56:14.960]  with Russia and doesn't want to back radical Islam yeah but I don't want to
[56:14.960 --> 56:18.160]  get into a debate on this I would concede that but then I could throw out
[56:18.160 --> 56:22.080]  something else where he might be more likely to cause trouble but I don't want
[56:22.080 --> 56:25.480]  to get into that that's back into the personality and bickering between you
[56:25.480 --> 56:29.960]  know political factions and I think elections are phony I think you you
[56:29.960 --> 56:34.480]  might not agree with this one but just think you know the establishment that
[56:34.480 --> 56:37.760]  deep state they've controlled these elections we control them overseas they
[56:37.760 --> 56:44.040]  control them here too so whether you had a run the and or Obama you know darn
[56:44.040 --> 56:47.360]  well the policies weren't gonna change you're hopeful you're keeping your
[56:47.360 --> 56:52.760]  fingers crossed I hope you're right I hope things you know if if a Trump would
[56:52.760 --> 56:59.800]  win that things would be better you're always honest no I agree with you I came
[56:59.800 --> 57:02.840]  this morning and I said they're preparing everyone for a Trump loss even
[57:02.840 --> 57:05.880]  though he's winning I said didn't I said to the crew I said the deep state
[57:05.880 --> 57:11.400]  doesn't want him and that's why he's good he's not a Ron Paul but a Ron Paul's
[57:11.400 --> 57:14.480]  on a Donald Trump you both have different you know attributes I wish you
[57:14.480 --> 57:18.240]  would become president I wish he would and and we'll see but you're right this
[57:18.240 --> 57:21.840]  election staged and they've rigged the whole deal and I think Donald Trump's
[57:21.840 --> 57:25.680]  right then you just said it to say it's rigged is Donald Trump right on that
[57:25.680 --> 57:32.280]  well it's been rigged for a long time my first election was in 1976 and I lost
[57:32.280 --> 57:40.000]  by a hundred votes on election and it came out on test and we found 1350 votes
[57:40.000 --> 57:46.200]  of absolutely fraud fraudulent votes we won in the course until it got to the
[57:46.200 --> 57:50.640]  Supreme Court of Texas and then we won there and then the next day they
[57:50.640 --> 57:53.400]  threw out one judge and said there was something wrong with him had a new
[57:53.400 --> 57:59.280]  election and of course we you know we lost the court contest too but that's
[57:59.280 --> 58:13.920]  way back then so there was I don't have any evidence of who gets rigging or
[58:13.920 --> 58:19.000]  whatnot but I just think that I think because what I have to say will be more
[58:19.000 --> 58:24.760]  of a more of a challenge to you because I think that some of the policies that
[58:24.760 --> 58:29.440]  Trump has supports that may be there because he's been told he has to take
[58:29.440 --> 58:34.600]  certain positions wow all right as you say it might be political dr. Paul thank
[58:34.600 --> 58:36.520]  you for the time amazing interview we look forward to speaking to you again
[58:36.520 --> 58:38.880]  soon
[58:43.000 --> 58:52.040]  visit GCN live comm today this is Ashley Beckford for info wars comm this is
[58:52.040 --> 58:56.880]  your tip of the week article for Merkola comm fluoride the only drug
[58:56.880 --> 59:01.760]  intentionally added to your tap water fluoride is an endocrine disrupting
[59:01.760 --> 59:07.200]  neurotoxic and bone weakening substance that the FDA defines as a drug when used
[59:07.200 --> 59:11.800]  to prevent disease because unlike the minerals we need humans have no known
[59:11.800 --> 59:16.920]  physiological requirement for fluoride sodium fluoride long known as an
[59:16.920 --> 59:21.320]  effective roach poison is added to tablets and drops for the purpose of
[59:21.320 --> 59:26.480]  preventing tooth decay in short sodium fluoride is not a nutritional supplement
[59:26.480 --> 59:31.480]  it is a prescription drug and a dangerous one FDA recently announced that
[59:31.480 --> 59:36.920]  marketing fluoride drops and tablets for cavity prevention violates federal law
[59:36.920 --> 59:41.520]  because FDA never approved these products as either safe or effective
[59:41.520 --> 59:46.840]  don't use fluoride use the Alexa pure water filter to remove contaminants from
[59:46.840 --> 59:55.520]  your water supply we're you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:08.760]  it's a long way to the top if you want to keep the parasites from not inflating
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:17.120]  your family live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones they beat our
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:22.920]  spirit down they want us to think we failed more week they're weak and now
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:34.440]  just like in the epic ode of the Norse Beowulf Grendel came for dinner but then
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:41.160]  Grendel finally ran into the champions and Grendel tried to get out the door
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:48.000]  but Beowulf didn't turn Lucifer's arm and then he took the door and started
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.760]  slamming it into his shoulder to rip the arm right out of the socket and Grendel
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:01:01.400]  crawled home to mama and we've killed Grendel make no mistake that's what
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:08.120]  Cain kept saying kept saying they killed us but we're still in the fight he
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:13.040]  said we're dead but we don't care we are dead very cryptic what Cain said we
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:17.680]  ought to try to find out everything they say is double meaning he slipped up to
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:24.280]  and they said we're gonna give you all disabilities oh I tell you I could see
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:34.240]  you little beady-eyed rat now their little demonic goddess has fallen but
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:38.000]  she will strike back make no mistake they killed us but they ain't whooped
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.920]  us yet that's right they killed us you know what you poisoned our culture and
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:46.680]  sowed your racism and all your trash and you know what you're a failure you
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:51.960]  little piece of crap you are the dishonorable maggot that's why you hate
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:57.720]  those of us that aren't aren't aren't vampires like you you little rat Matt
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:00.400]  wanted to pop in anytime the crew wants to pop in other welcome we've got a
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:03.240]  bunch of big guys haven't told you he's coming up yet it's loaded with with key
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:06.760]  folks obviously see Pachani's gonna pop in we're gonna have Roger Stone back in
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:11.200]  the studio he just got up we're going to have much other big guests here it's a
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:15.120]  52 hour broadcast I haven't checked since last now we had 20 something million
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:20.320]  people that had tuned in via the streams in the last 30 something hours then so
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:24.120]  it's huge I said hey let's get a hundred million but I'm very happy with it's
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:28.120]  probably 30 something million now it's 26 27 million last night just on streams
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:32.720]  and videos and things we've done the last you know 36 hours or so then now
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:38.560]  it's 40 something almost 50 hours but Matt to win this we've got a like you
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:43.520]  said organize the Trump people into just nonpartisan defenders of a rediscovery
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:47.640]  of the Bill of Rights and Constitution and then run for public office in case
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:50.320]  the globals ever get back in control of federal government we're gonna have to
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:56.880]  really build the political defenses to resist yeah so this is some advice
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:01.920]  that you know I spitballed with Richard Reeves when we spent some time together
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:06.800]  on the campaign trail earlier this year for the primaries and I you know I've
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:10.440]  got to thank you for that you know for the ability to work here and and the
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:16.320]  ability to go learn firsthand you know real politics and this kind of comes
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:21.480]  on the heels of that so you know right now we're talking about starting this
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:26.680]  the war has just begun it's it's actually I feel like the war has been
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:30.880]  going on for a little while now there's been like this perception war I dream
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:34.760]  it's gone from a cold war to a hot war now we just we just actually won the
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:39.520]  battle of the bulge we need to corner Hitler now you know I mean if you think
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:43.880]  about this as a metaphor and the way you do that is you find the people who are
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:47.920]  wearing Trump gear if they're easier to find now than ever right the people who
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:51.320]  are wearing Trump is my present the people who are wearing you shake them
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:54.760]  you find you shake their hands because they're trying to bully us and make
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:58.640]  everybody be scared and say it's racist and all this crap especially white
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:02.000]  Trump supporters and others and an Hispanic black supporters you name it we
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.840]  have to all come together with sort of in parties we've got to have a meetup
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:08.600]  groups gonna have softball teams we gotta like go on vacation together and
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:12.040]  just say hey yeah we're racist this is what real love's all about you can't
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:15.160]  we're all coming together you little bastards you can't expect to make America
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:19.000]  great again just by voting you got to go out you got to make relationships with
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.880]  the people out there who are like-minded individuals and you got to go out you
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:26.320]  got to get in in groups and you can become a delegate that's right they're
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:29.400]  trying to create division and make everybody uncomfortable to be with
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:32.880]  each other because it's classic divide and conquer we have to come together and
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:38.120]  show them the real thing of course yeah it's it's time for the people to rule
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:41.360]  you know we we've seen it with the turnout in the polls for this for the
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:47.000]  election and yeah where your Trump gear loud and proud absolutely and hold
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.200]  Trump's feet to the fire he needs our support that means defending from the
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:56.000]  media when he's right not least wrong and use this movement to expand the
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.920]  defense it was Thomas Jefferson who once said that our country is now taking
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:04.760]  so steady of course as to show by what rodeo will pass to destruction to wit by
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:08.760]  consolidation of power first and then corruption it's necessary consequence
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:12.360]  Jefferson was warning us about the global elite the 1% of the 1%
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.680]  consolidating the world's wealth and subverting the people's voice in
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:19.800]  government unfortunately we didn't heed his advice we now live in a neo-futalistic
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:23.240]  society which were treated as indentured servants who only exist to serve the
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:26.480]  needs of the establishment political office no longer represents the voice
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:30.160]  of the people but rather the initiation process politicians go through to gain
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:33.880]  acceptance into the aristocracy simply put we the people are responsible for
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.800]  civilization and culture yet we're suppressed by a tiny elite who have
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:39.920]  organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around the world we
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:43.640]  falsely believe that everything is simply black and white one extreme against
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:47.080]  the other conservative versus liberal but things will change once more of us
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:50.560]  realize this truth as Thomas Jefferson also said in light of the people
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:54.160]  generally in tyranny and oppressions of the body and mind will vanish like evil

[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:11.080]  smart Trump's being nice on the surface but now the Clintons must be indicted
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:16.480]  and the other Republicans don't want that because they're involved to well Paul
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:20.160]  Ryan and others we now knows a Democratic Party operative it all came out

[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:49.880]  compilation a minute and a half of Trump in his victory speech it was all
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:53.720]  wonderful and I get he was supposed to be in Consulatory notice Hillary though
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:11:00.280]  stirred up a race garbage in in in her speech and all her surrogates who get
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:05.360]  direct orders from them are in hyperdrive right now saying this is a
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:09.080]  white lash and white people are bad they don't want minorities though the
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:14.800]  majority now to have the birthright of guns and private property and everything
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:19.960]  that comes with the West I could listen white people boarded all their kids we
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:22.880]  don't deserve to have the future fine I'm just a person I don't care what color

[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:33.480]  Gavin McInnes is a movie star founder of Vice then of course big TV host radio
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:37.920]  host great guy everybody from you know 60 year old women to my 14 year old son

[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:45.440]  from their headquarters in New York but first here is what I mentioned from the
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:58.160]  compilation I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton she congratulated
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:05.720]  us it's about us on our victory that's right and I congratulated her and her
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:11.800]  family on a very very hard fought campaign I mean she she fought very
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:17.120]  hard supposedly impossible hours time for America to bind the wounds of
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:23.400]  division I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:31.880]  Americans and this is so important to me for those who have chosen not to
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:38.080]  support me in the past of which there were a few people I'm reaching out to
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:44.440]  you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:50.600]  great country now Obama says working together we should all root for Trump
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:56.200]  now we will begin a total bait switch of rebuilding our nation and renewing the
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:03.360]  American dream it's been what they call a historic event but to be really
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:08.160]  historic we have to do a great job that's right and I promise you that I
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:16.200]  will not let you down we will do a great show I can only say that while the
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:23.880]  campaign is over our work on this movement is now really just right we
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:27.840]  want a major battle but now they're going to strike back Gavin McInnis again
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:33.640]  we give you his website you can go there it's a listed up on four dot com compound
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:38.920]  media dot com Gavin so much happening what's your first approximation of this
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:43.560]  my gut tells me you know stabilizer we're deflectors watch for enemy fighters
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:50.120]  that we this war just started Alex you got to learn to indulge yourself we're
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:55.320]  this is party mode at least for 24 hours right now we here at compound media are
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:14:00.360]  focused on the first two motley crew albums too fast for love shout at the
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:06.400]  devil we've been drinking all night this is I feel like I just won the NBA I mean
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.280]  you got in the NBA and all my friends are going hey man can you help me with
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:13.400]  this car wash idea and I'm going yeah yeah yeah we'll get to that we'll get to
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:20.480]  that right now we just won the lottery we just stole America back from the
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:24.480]  established yeah this is a devastating repudiation the mainstream media of all
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:28.920]  the fake polls and they tried to hang info wars around Trump's neck which he
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:33.120]  was smart and actually you took our whole operation and made his blueprint I
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:37.040]  mean quite frankly he's told me that personally and it blew up in their face
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:40.880]  and it shows how synthetic it is suddenly they're all just silent they
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:43.760]  don't know what to do they're crapping themselves so I agree a celebration of
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:47.120]  everybody you in New York wearing Trump gear them you know absolutely
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:53.000]  groveling in fear it's now time for the return of men go ahead you know my
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.080]  favorite word I'm hearing from the media today is inexplicable Trump's
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:02.600]  inexplicable victory and to me that says so much that one word cuz one your
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:07.120]  job as a journalist is to explain things you can't so you're admitting in that
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:11.440]  one word that you don't know how to do your job
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:18.440]  other speech polls racism dad's a little the poll they keep them at the
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:22.400]  polls what happened with the polls yeah mom's picked up the phone dad's went
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:26.560]  and voted and the other great thing about it inexplicable is it shows what we
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:31.000]  all have known and we you and I have been screaming this for decades the media is
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.160]  totally separated themselves from America they have no idea they've never
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:40.360]  met a plumber they've never met a flyover blue-collar dude and so when
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:44.640]  these guys admit that hey I'm actually America when you think of America it's
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:48.560]  not New York and it's not LA it's everywhere else and journalists are
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:52.480]  going what do you mean it's not New York in LA I googled it and you go yeah
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:56.200]  dude you never left your desk you don't know your own country
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:16:02.000]  oh wow I'm sure we should be celebrating but I do I mean I want to be ready when
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.360]  they you know try the next assault they're going they're doubling down all
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:09.440]  the race garbage the riot garbage I mean this is just crazy what are you
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:14.640]  expecting next I feel like we're in the driver's seat though don't you I mean I
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:18.160]  haven't even you know what's funny about this whole thing I feel like a night and
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:23.200]  I've been handed my sword back as a patriarch as a father and my first
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:27.400]  instinct with this sword is not to go the way Hillary would and start getting
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:32.480]  revenge like I haven't even looked up all these videos of Democrats crying
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:37.480]  because we are good at power and now that we have it back we're not vindict
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:42.000]  no no I agree I agree that that if it was a normal enemy that that you know we
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.800]  could just kind of let them like a fart in the wind you blow out of the car the
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:48.680]  problem is they will come back and justice has to be served but but I'm
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:53.760]  open to your idea I mean take the high road and just kind of forget them and
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:58.640]  move forward and just hope they just blow away well that's the ultimate
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:02.600]  question but at least we're in the driver's seat so the question I think
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:06.840]  is you're in the plane there's a gremlin on the wing and he's attacking the plane
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:11.440]  as he always has been before we didn't know the pilot we didn't have a pilot
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:14.680]  that we could trust now we have a pilot we can trust there's still gremlins on
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:18.360]  the wing we still have to fight I told that's the best analogy from the twilight
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:21.040]  zone we got William Shatter on the plane he keeps saying that no one's
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:25.320]  listening to us finally everybody on the plane sees the gremlin so now we can
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:29.680]  deal with a little sucker yes if we have to do a dry landing we can do that the
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:33.720]  pilots on board everyone believes us about the gremlin this election said I
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:37.400]  know you're right there is a gremlin on the wing and now we're wondering where
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:41.600]  we're gonna land we're gonna bring this country back America was really reborn
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:45.640]  today because if Hillary won I'll tell you what I was going to give up and just
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:48.880]  it's sort of I went to Paris after the Bataclan attacks and I talked to
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:52.520]  Parisians there about their Muslim problem and they were in total denial and
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:57.440]  I just sort of after five days there I just went or a war France you're done
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:02.000]  you are a roc of the irrevocably lost and I was gonna feel that way if Hillary
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.560]  won and now the Trump is back of course we got tons of work to do of course we
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:09.040]  got to keep sticking into the social justice warriors but we're doing it from
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:14.520]  the driver's seat finally I totally agree with you and once you finally see
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:18.800]  the gremlin you can't ever put or the goblin once you've been in a goblin's
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:22.720]  nest I mean there's no putting that back at the bottle people now understand
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:28.420]  what's going on yes doesn't it feel good I mean I've got all these texts on my
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:32.320]  phone just congratulations we got it back I mean hundreds of texts of people
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:35.520]  going we did it I can't believe it but someone got your email me no friend
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:42.200]  Wisconsin to exclamation point question mark yes the whole country said you know
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:46.760]  what we tried it your way we gave you the steering wheel and you crashed so
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:50.880]  give me the steering wheel back I'm driving from now on I'm going to do what
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:55.040]  America was built on which is I'm going to be an entrepreneur I'm gonna take
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:59.480]  risks and I'm going to leave people alone that really is what America is all
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:03.840]  about is so it's not about who are winners or losers we don't want just the
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:07.080]  dopamine to say we're winners that's why I'm not even a big sports thing is I
[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:10.080]  don't want to watch somebody else have a victory and I somehow live through it
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:13.640]  but I get sports I played sports with this this is real blood sport this is
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:16.920]  for the whole world for all the marbles with a bunch of really creepy weird
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:20.960]  people when you read their emails we want to make people poor and dumb we
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:24.920]  want to control them these are really nasty uncool people that no one would
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:29.200]  want to associate with in the real world all of Hillary's people really hate her
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:33.640]  they've all been bullied they've all been paid by the big multinationals to say
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:37.720]  this I think a lot of the people in the media and the system now are kind of
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:41.760]  glad this happened because they were closet Trump supporters so we can't
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:46.720]  forget about that that this is about coming up for air not being bullied
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:49.600]  anymore and that's why it's so important for everybody to wear their Trump gear
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:54.080]  everywhere and then to organize again it's just like you said have fun people
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:57.600]  should of all race colors creeds come together and say you're full of it we're
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:01.480]  not racist we want freedom we're gonna go out and watch a ball game a bunch of
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:05.000]  people of different colors and be together and be real not sit there and
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.920]  watch fake simulated liberal shows where there's these made-up neighborhoods
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:11.960]  where everybody's just living together and happiness we should actually go out
[01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:15.960]  and do it to repudiate them because they are obsessed with dividing and
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:20.080]  conquering us it's their only hope Gavin McKinnon's this is vindication I mean
[01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:23.800]  this is what America's all about and Alexis to Tocqueville talked about this
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:28.560]  in democracy in America where he came here a camera when it was 1800s and he
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:33.520]  was just blown away by the way America works he said that democracy is slow
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:38.440]  and sluggish and inefficient but once the people set their mind to something
[01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:43.880]  nothing can stand in its way and I was getting scared like when Assange said
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:49.080]  that Trump can't win because the big powers the big banks pharma the
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:54.400]  military industrial complex everyone he's not in any of their pockets so
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:57.680]  they won't let him win the powers that be won't let him in and I gotta admit
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:01.120]  I was talking to Ezra Levant about this we were both petrified by that no I was
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:05.480]  too but but but notice clearly there were some states where the polls didn't
[01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:10.160]  line up he should have won they tried they did steal but all the experts say
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:13.880]  Bev Harris and others agree you cannot block a landslide with a
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:18.280]  decentralized election yeah you can bust in all the illegals you want you can
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:22.320]  mess with the polls and what we just learned last night was with all its
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:28.520]  flaws with all its its saboteurs with all the gremlins on the wing America can
[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:32.320]  still win the founding fathers are watching this right now and going I
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:36.280]  knew you had it in you I knew you could win the people just beat the
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:41.000]  establishment that's huge I went to two polling places yesterday a lot of it was
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:47.200]  a live feed and it was Hispanic males with their sons and daughters mainly
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:51.200]  good-looking strong hard-working guys pulling up in nice trucks they want
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:54.560]  America they are America they were the folks actually coming over I mean like
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:58.320]  15 people and I was like they're like 20 minutes because they the poll they ran
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:03.040]  me off and no I wasn't breaking the laws at 100 feet back and if she was nice
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:07.280]  whatever the point is is that this is a joke after all she said yes but you know
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:12.360]  we didn't always the point is is that all this is going on and and it was just
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:15.880]  so good that I guarantee you it was a bigger landslide people even know but I
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:20.760]  did see white women who look totally upset alone they don't know why life's
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:25.080]  not happy they don't know the government and the media is their husband and they
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:28.920]  were looking at me and just totally freaked out and just like they thought
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:31.920]  the end of the world was happening well that's the problem with their
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:36.680]  narrative is it's not a good America to live in it's based on fear it says that
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:41.560]  America is a racist hellhole where no one has a chance and you need welfare and
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:45.440]  you need social security you need all these government programs to help you
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:50.280]  thrive because you live in hell and it's bad for them that's the irony of all
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:54.160]  this our version of events which is based on reality is best not just for the
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:58.880]  white male patriarchs it's best for every like oh no Donald Trump's gonna get
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:04.680]  rid of taxes for people making 40,000 or less oh it's horrible you know what
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:10.760]  really happened also is the word bigot has been such a successful way to
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:15.040]  permanently brand someone as a witch in Salem and now you have to be burned at
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:19.680]  the stake once you get that marker on you you're doomed for life and what
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:22.440]  Trump did is he's went yeah I'm not interested in that word you can call
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:26.560]  me that all you want and you know what else America's sick of the stigma we're
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:31.880]  sick of the shame we want to make well Gavin listen to this I mean we played
[01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:35.560]  the clips we should play it again Van Jones goes on TV and says this is a
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:40.360]  white lash this is the white people it's a bad white people it's so KKK
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:43.880]  Grand Dragon and it wasn't record numbers of Blacks wedding for Trump
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:49.360]  Hispanics all of it despite all their lies and it's just the savage injection of
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:54.640]  race to control people and to make sure this plantation owner keeps you on the
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:24:01.040]  little reservation it's so boring to I mean ultimately people are too lazy to
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:06.000]  be racist we're too self-indulgent if I meet a black guy who likes the same
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.720]  sports teams I like and he's sitting next to me at the bar what am I gonna do
[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:13.600]  say no I'm not gonna enjoy your company because of some made-up bias I have
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:18.800]  I mean I mean if I like some black artists like Jimi Hendrix I'm not even
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:22.040]  thinking he's a black it's if I think a black woman looks good I'm thinking
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:26.400]  she's even black that's a woman I think looks good yeah exactly remember when
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:28.840]  the black lady was driving around and saw the checkpoint got scared around from
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:35.440]  the cops and they killed her yeah it was terrible but I was on there saying
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:39.160]  it's horrible that they killed this woman the black lives matter type group
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:42.400]  was like oh you only kick her she's white then when it came out she was black
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:46.160]  have people going oh Alex thank you for caring about a black lady I'm just sad
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:49.920]  an unarmed woman got killed I don't I'm not the one thinking what color somebody
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:54.280]  skin is it really gets to me well that's the irony of their narrative in this
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:59.280]  fear-based culture blacks end up getting so scared becoming so scared of cops
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:04.320]  that they go oh I saw on MSNBC that you guys just shoot me for sport I mean when
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:07.400]  there was a black woman during the Dallas riots who said I have to worry
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:11.560]  when I go to the grocery store that it could be shot by a cop and you go so in
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:16.680]  this world that they've created for you cops sit in grocery stores and peg you
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:21.000]  off like they're deer hunting or something that's insane and that's a
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.040]  horrible place to live so not only do they make up a mythical universe but
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:29.040]  they made a horrible mythical universe if you're gonna make up a lie put
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:32.920]  unicorns in it or something make it nice why did you make such a terrible
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:39.800]  horrible scary fake place and again you talked to folks because we shot the
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:43.880]  female age creelix of video the other day out live in Austin oh it's worth
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:48.240]  this video you got to see this and again I'm not singling out white women it's
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:52.040]  just that tends to be the group that's the most insane and they're just they're
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:56.520]  going he's a homo foam they're just freaking out ten times what I'm doing
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:26:05.880]  right now I don't even want to expend the energy just and it's just like what
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:11.320]  the hell these people are in a frickin cult man just totally made up and then
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:15.640]  you tell people the police only shoot a couple hundred people that are
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:18.720]  questionable year yes there's some bad cops but that's a very rare form of
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:22.800]  death there's 340 million of us being struck by lightning kills a 50 times
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:26.680]  with the cops and they just go shut up you racist white pig you have no right
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:30.560]  you're white and you're going you are a white guy telling me this right now with
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:33.120]  zits all over your face you look like you know I'm not trying to be mean it's
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:36.160]  just like you're like some dumbass losing their mother's basement and you're
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:40.200]  screaming at me that I'm an effing white male so I have no right to exist when
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:44.040]  you're an effing white male you know it's really sad what we've done to women
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:48.160]  I'm looking at these women right now we reach into their bodies we grab their
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:51.840]  ovaries we rip them out and we threw them in the garbage now they've evolved
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:55.800]  over hundreds of thousands of years to basically be busy bodies I mean they're
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:59.720]  good at dealing with hunting and gathering in the local cave and dealing
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:04.240]  with four kids five kids six kids we ripped that away from them and now they
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:08.240]  have all this extra energy and they expend it on the mythical universe and
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:11.780]  telling you you're racist and screaming about the patriarchy and all this dumb
[01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:15.920]  crap where you just go what are you doing what are you talking about your life
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:20.040]  is miserable by the way if they just come back to the patriarchy they'd be
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:24.080]  happier than a pig and you know what and the statistics show that it's only I
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:28.360]  want to run some patriarchy it's not that men kill themselves in wars they
[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:32.720]  explore we are the slaves of the women we are the worker bees dumbasses
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:37.320]  you're sitting back at the palace you are the queen if you only take the
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:41.360]  throne exactly yeah that's the funny thing is they want to be part of our
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:45.400]  world our world do you take the coolest job I mean we both have pretty cool
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:49.320]  jobs you take the coolest job in the world oh 90% of it is an excel
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:54.120]  spreadsheet going over costs and dealing with the minutia of these cables
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:57.680]  aren't working and we need to try to get an adapter and these women bust out of
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:00.680]  the kitchen and they go I want to be part of your world you go okay it's
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:05.040]  mostly number crunching but war or it's pouring concrete all day and 110 degree
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:10.360]  heat and having some god-bitch at you that's that's our world we built you a
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:15.400]  palace as you say we set you up with a pretty good deal because we are in awe
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:20.560]  of the miracle of birth that you can make a human being so we go Jesus you're
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:24.960]  a wizard here with every culture the women were actually worshiped as a goddess
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:29.120]  so you know they're like this is what we protect yeah I mean that's I don't know
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:32.160]  I feel like that's most of church you're sitting there you're thinking about the
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:36.680]  miracle of birth and you're just going wow thank you thank you for this gift and
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:39.880]  when we see a woman it's almost like they're closer to God because they're
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:44.800]  magic so we build them a house and we'll work 24 hours we'll truck we'll deliver a
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:48.600]  package across the country drive for three days straight on amphetamines just
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:52.560]  to make sure she's okay and then she goes no I hate this thing I want to do
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:55.480]  what you're doing and I want to scream and everyone and I want to take over and
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:59.760]  everyone's a bigot and you go what why are you adding a computer virus into our
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:03.080]  perfect system and if you're gonna replace it by the way you should be
[01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:06.040]  replacing it with something better they were trying to destroy us and replace
[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:10.440]  our whole system with something way worse well that's because they want to end
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:13.840]  the human species to create a manufactured system like the Terminator seeds
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:17.200]  where the plants don't produce more seeds they're just turning us into a total
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:21.440]  commodity and as Hitler said first you get the women then you've got the
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:24.840]  children so follow the men they are targeting women and and then they're
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:28.640]  just totally desperate and sad and it's hemp but men have to be men again to
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:32.320]  turn this around compound media comm Gavin McKinnis you're a great guy I got

[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:34.360]  all over the body as a matter of fact there's 25 genes in the body that are
[01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:41.120]  directly dependent upon selenium so it really is a all-around nutrient that

[01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:22.360]  with my old 45 there's a country boy can survive because you can't starve us out
[01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:29.760]  and you can't make us run these old boys were raised on shotguns because we say
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:41.120]  grace we say amen and if you ain't into that we don't give a damn you know it's
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:46.520]  crazy I look at the incompatibility of what the
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:49.680]  globalists are trying to build and how disconnected they are and how really
[01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:53.920]  delusional they were that they could steal this election when history was on
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:58.880]  our side if they stole it it would have blown up with their face even bigger so
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:04.080]  we've had a moral victory here but they're now trying to take the Senate
[01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:07.720]  back from the Republicans that supposedly want it they're claiming in
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:10.800]  New Hampshire they're gonna try more of this now okay they're gonna try to go
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:13.600]  back now they're not gonna announce their challenge in the election that's
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:16.880]  why Hillary waited till three in the morning I mean we're up here at three
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:22.280]  in the morning waiting for her to finally come out and then she just didn't
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:29.800]  they sent a scurrying rat out there John Podesta and you know and he's not it's
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:35.080]  it's a satanic rituals he's doing hotdog parties and he's he's often doing
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:41.000]  whatever else he does and I'm telling you I felt it last week I saw it too the
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.880]  number one story on the internet because drudge linked to it that spirit
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:49.280]  cooking article blew a giant bloody hole on their side they kind of crawled off
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:53.520]  to die over in the bushes politically but they're still not completely dead and
[01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:56.960]  they got a bow and arrow over there and they will shoot us in the back so we got
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:00.720]  to pull back stay out of range while they bleed to death and they're going to
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:03.800]  try to now go in and and steal some house seats they're gonna do some other
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:09.160]  stuff Bev Harris has a lot of integrity she's been a Democrat a liberal she
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:13.280]  exposed what Bush did and I was bipartisan but there was more evidence of
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:16.640]  Republican fraud than the Democrat both parties do it and she said last week
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:19.440]  what Assange said they're not gonna let Trump have it the fix is in I'm no
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:23.480]  rocket scientist but I've said this I saw places where she won by such margins
[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:27.960]  even their fake polls didn't say that but they weren't in full control you can't
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:31.800]  stop a landslide I don't know Bev Harris's view on this yet I want to find
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:36.840]  out but I respect it she is the expert globally I'm not bragging it's just a
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:40.640]  fact for us people need to know how accomplishing on target she is she's had
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:44.120]  more exposure of election fraud than everybody else combined and that's not
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:47.720]  poo-pooing all those great folks she is so effective and when she was on a week
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:50.720]  and a half ago it made national news she released the information here on the
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:53.880]  on the fraction magic these programs they found around the country that have no
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:57.720]  reason to be there but for fraud to pre-program what's gonna happen at the
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:01.160]  central system and of course Soros is involved and she just said it you know
[01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:04.400]  most the evidence is the Democrats and Soros it's that looks like they're
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:07.840]  crying to do this well and just a lay looking at this being a full night
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:11.800]  covering it having the polls for each state in front of me it looks like they
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:15.640]  weren't in control of some areas and that's why Trump won because it's a
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:19.360]  landslide but it should have been an even bigger victory and so it looks like
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:25.240]  that that that again Bev Harris has always said on the show for 15 years you
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:29.000]  can't steal a landslide now I'm gonna find out about my wrong or I'm right
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.560]  here from her but of course we're pretty close to this right now we'll no
[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:37.800]  more as it unfolds but Bev Harris I mean is that a basically accurate what I
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:44.360]  said is wrong yeah basically accurate did pretty good Alex you know as I was
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:49.280]  watching you today a few things the observations one one thing struck me
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:54.320]  very early in the morning yesterday is they had been planning fireworks and
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:58.040]  then they said the Clinton campaign suddenly canceled their fireworks they
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:03.800]  did this early in the morning which makes me curious as to whether you know
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:07.960]  their intel are they already knew they were in trouble at that point because it
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:11.480]  didn't make sense otherwise they may have still thought they could pull it off
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:16.080]  another thing that struck me though I have seen particularly with the
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:23.480]  Democrats a tactic where they'll take a concentrated blue area and hold back the
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:28.200]  results for hours and hours and hours that's it for example when Hillary ran
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:33.880]  against Obama in the primary in Indiana Lake County which is East Chicago and
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:38.160]  Gary I knew it you know came in like ridiculous hours later and then when
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:43.000]  and suddenly turned the state to her right what they're doing when they hold
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:48.640]  back these dense areas of it is they're basically figuring out watching the
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:54.000]  results come in and seeing how much they need in order to to tip the thing and
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.280]  then they'll you know send those results once they've got the amount that they
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:03.160]  need to beat it into the system last night they were holding back and it was
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:08.200]  ridiculous they were holding back Detroit in Michigan Milwaukee in
[01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:15.800]  Wisconsin Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania and Nashua in New Hampshire and that's what
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:21.720]  has a nine words what the heck they can't and they have putting this you they
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:26.480]  can't count nine words in six hours I mean no they were holding it back because
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:32.760]  it's 10% but I think as you continue to watch Trump was absolutely rolling
[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:38.160]  through mowing it down in the rural areas and they didn't have enough they
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:40.720]  couldn't you know they could hold them back if they want they couldn't come up
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:45.600]  with enough to overtake that you know a hundred and fifty percent of the
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:50.040]  population voting right so so it doesn't matter you can fraction magic it but you
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:53.080]  can only fraction magic it to a hundred percent you can't do anything more than
[01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:58.320]  that and so so I mean as a top expert on this and we're going to roll through the
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:02.000]  evidence you saw but but I mean give us a boil down then it's pretty clear then
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:06.520]  to see they tried to steal it but the tsunami was so big it broke their back
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:12.200]  yeah and and the remember fraction magic is done by a local fixer or regional
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:16.400]  fixer who has inside access you're not going to do that in every single county
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:19.040]  and if you're only going to choose certain counties you're going to pick the
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:24.040]  big urban counties you have to pick those small little rural areas and what I was
[01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:30.720]  watching happen last night is he was taking it in the rural areas and he was
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:36.320]  taking all the small counties to this tremendous margin she also wasn't
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:40.520]  performing as you know she the other thing is she simply was not she's not
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:46.360]  Obama she wasn't pulling Obama's voters but but in other words if you're going
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:49.720]  to fraction magic it you're you're going to be selective about what you do and
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:52.840]  you're going to pick where that you know you have the greatest opportunity to do
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:56.280]  something with the least I agree with you that it was seismic but I before when
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:01.160]  they canceled the fireworks what he had what he had was dispersed really tough
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:05.840]  to deal with that you know it's really tough to deal with that so I don't know
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:12.520]  but I do tend to my this is just a gut feeling really is not based on facts at
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:19.280]  this point okay but I think that it he probably may have gotten more even you
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:24.160]  know then that was reported I mean well that's exactly what I've been saying is
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:28.080]  that because I mean I was in the polling places and I mean and there were all
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:31.160]  these Hispanic folks make men coming over telling me they were voting for
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:34.760]  Trump and I was just like wow there was not a lot of white guys it was a bunch
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:39.960]  of you know women and Hispanic men voting and and and just seeing that and
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:44.080]  what I see on the street in a Democrat city I don't see any Hillary stickers
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:48.240]  there were Obama stickers everywhere well I'm very good a part of the country I
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:53.200]  have to be in California right now and you know what I'm seeing here is folks
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:56.640]  are just misdemeanor how as to how it could happen it has to do with what
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:02.040]  you're surrounded with and you know that's the big country is different in
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:08.640]  different demographics but you know it was it was particularly telling to me I
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:12.480]  can't tell you how weird it was to see that they had already canceled their
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:19.440]  celebratory fireworks early in the morning it's like that could happen if
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:24.080]  they had their people on the ground telling them you know you have lines
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:27.880]  and lines and lines of people voting and they ain't voting for you I mean if
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:31.320]  that's the problem they may have said okay let's at least make it a little bit
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:36.400]  subtle you know this was an interesting election and it's going to continue to
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:40.880]  be interesting because you know the next thing has to be that we haven't solved
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:44.800]  any of these problems by the way you know we still have to get the ballot
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:49.200]  images released we now have another state Virginia that has refused to give up
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:56.040]  the evidence of the election we have now got Virginia Washington State Utah
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:42:03.040]  Kansas Nevada and Indiana all saying that they're going to refuse to give over
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:07.640]  any evidence of what the election actually was and so we haven't solved the
[01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:14.360]  problem it is true you can't necessarily tamper a landslide but you can do a
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:19.440]  whole lot of the state and and local races and you can certainly do any of
[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:25.440]  the congressional races so until they make the elections transparent and let
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:28.560]  us have what we have a right to have which already exists which is the
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:33.680]  records in the machines we're still not out of the woods on this and it's just
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:37.600]  going to happen again or there's something I think the problem there was
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:45.240]  she couldn't really plausibly win now Bev Harris that is exactly my analysis
[01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:51.360]  and our Cruz analysis watching this Hillary absolutely looked really freaked
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:55.080]  out the night before the election when she was campaigning a bill looked
[01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:59.160]  really defeated all day yesterday you could see it and I think it's clear
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:04.160]  they cancel the fireworks because they knew they knew yeah they knew and they
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:07.520]  were hoping maybe they could pull it off by holding back these bigger but it's
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:12.640]  you know strange this is I mean really strange they're like well Detroit which
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:18.360]  is Wayne County Michigan we're at 80% this is it like every two or three
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:24.000]  o'clock in the morning their time come on that is not how it happens the whole I
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:28.560]  mean it is no reason whatsoever that you can't have your road total by three
[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:32.320]  o'clock in the morning unless you're holding it back so and and now all over
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:34.800]  the country you just mentioned we can go over these Roger Stone has now joined
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:38.040]  us former Trump campaign head and obviously the media finally figured out
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:42.360]  one of the main actual brains involved on Stephen Bannon Bev Harris is here
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:46.640]  with us he's here with us in studio I mean I think it's important even though
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:50.640]  Trump has won for the integrity of the election I got a sneak in suspicion you
[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:55.680]  already pointing towards it that this is this is fraud against against Trump in
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:58.200]  fact that's where the evidence is pointing that Harris is a liberal she is
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:01.920]  a Democrat she has total credibility she's here telling you that but still we
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:04.760]  should just investigate because this is you know just as we done maybe the
[01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:08.080]  heavens fall we're not going to test the election it was a tsunami a huge
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:12.640]  realignment for populism a takeover of the Republican Party a repudiation of
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:17.280]  their horrible blue blood behavior and let's just say it racist behavior in
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:22.320]  many cases this is beautiful but but looking at this I mean can you recap
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:27.280]  that or expand on it about where we should look for the fraud and why that's
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:32.960]  important well you know you the bottom line that the take away on this is we
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:36.960]  still need to get the systems transparent so that we can verify the vote I
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:42.600]  mean you can't do that then it's just waiting for some other disaster in the
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:46.400]  future there is one other thing that struck me that I'd like to mention I
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:50.120]  mean it really struck me as odd there was a point in time in which New Hampshire
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:56.600]  was separated by only 96 votes and yet you did not and by the way and I think
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:45:01.280]  Pennsylvania at one point was separated by only 2400 votes in a lot of states this
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:06.160]  triggers this can actually trigger even a mandatory recap we did not see a peak
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:11.280]  even in the closest closest states that there was even the possibility even a
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:18.080]  discussion of any recount anywhere and we would we should have probably seen
[01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:21.960]  that I mean it's abnormal that we didn't with some of the very at the stages
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:24.480]  where it was very close you know because the pundits have to have something to
[01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:30.200]  talk about and that can signal of course what happens in a recount is great
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:36.680]  scrutiny of the vote count it can signal hey we don't really want any
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:42.240]  scrutiny of this we being Democrats any scrutiny of this count any further
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:47.320]  scrutiny we're not even going to discuss the idea any further scrutiny so that
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:52.680]  also kind of makes you think hmm you know I mean if you really are hard spot
[01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:58.160]  and you're separated by 94 votes my goodness why wouldn't you you know so
[01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:05.160]  it makes you wonder but yeah it doesn't it doesn't give me any more
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:10.200]  confidence in the process it's you know it just doesn't we basically until we
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:16.320]  can verify the count which the records are already in the system to do that
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:20.840]  they're just simply refusing to let anybody in the public see them even
[01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:25.160]  though under freedom of age of information law it's our right so you
[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:27.680]  know until they do that it seems like they're hiding something
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:31.960]  Beth I'm just I'm just I'm just stunned here listening to you it's it's so
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:36.560]  amazing and and again you're maximum you can't steal a landslide Roger Stone
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:39.920]  I also want to ask Bev Harris is just a political question for the lady that
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:44.960]  heads up like box voting dot org hacking democracy top HBO film the leading
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:49.160]  election fraud expert in the world who's just exposed the big kahuna with her
[01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:52.000]  engineers and software folks that discovered it the fraction magic
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:56.000]  clearly in play here against Trump but it all blew up in their face because it
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:00.360]  was such a tsunami Roger I want to ask you this question then Bev I'm not a
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:03.160]  vindictive person Napoleon the first time he was
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:06.880]  defeated was sent to what was at Alba and then he came back later and millions
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:11.320]  were killed he started a whole new war the polly was a nice guy compared to
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:15.720]  these globalist I mean George Soros and all these people it's not vindiction it
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:21.240]  we have to give them no quarter they've got to be brought to justice for the
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:24.640]  crimes they've committed I'm really concerned and I hope it was just
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:29.520]  conciliatory he promised to lock lock her up special prosecutor and that the
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:34.000]  evidence is overwhelming don't we need to immediately I guess as soon as he gets
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:38.160]  in in two months we have to bring them to justice it's not political vindictiveness
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:42.200]  these people are legendary criminals Roger we're either a nation of laws or
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:46.560]  we're a nation of men either there are consequences on what the Clintons have
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:52.040]  done at long last or they are able to continue to dodge justice this is
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:56.560]  something a prosecutor in a court has to decide but right the real problem has
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:48:02.680]  been ability to bring the charges to get a fair indictment and trial first of
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:07.640]  all I want to salute you for the amazing work that you are doing you know as you
[01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:14.280]  know we tried to track some of the as some of the exit polling to be compared
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:18.680]  to machine totals and therefore we've taken a hard look at all the work you've
[01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:24.600]  done and I salute you you are an amazing person and you have done amazing work so
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:29.360]  my hats off to my hats off to you that what's your view on that question I mean
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:31.880]  you're all about justice I mean if it came out the problem is getting on
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:38.640]  cover it yeah you know my next book the title of my next book is black box
[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:43.280]  America and it is dealing with the underlying corruption issues I started
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:47.720]  studying money laundering which is sort of by net by definition complicated just
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:52.000]  like exploding is like oh my goodness you go through this open I've been doing
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.840]  that for about four years and I've been studying it off of indictments you know
[01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:59.880]  where they unravel it in the indictment and you know it looked pretty darn
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:04.360]  clear to me from for what quite a while now that the foundation is actually a
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:09.040]  money laundering operation it does need to be investigated and it does need to
[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:12.280]  be investigated I'm not going to say that there is guilt before it's been
[01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:16.080]  ascertained in the court of law but it definitely needs to be investigated
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:22.840]  because it just it just looks that way I mean I know you are formally I may not
[01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:28.040]  be the president's role it may be the Congress's role but there has to be a
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:34.080]  and an actual bona fide investigation well we need an honest attorney general
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:39.960]  we need a non-political attorney general one who will go on the basis of the law
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:44.880]  I can think of a half dozen people men and women who would be an exemplary
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:50.920]  attorney general but we've had Eric Holder we've had Loretta Lynch we've had
[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:56.080]  a succession it better not be Giuliani I don't think it will be Giuliani he'll
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:00.920]  be too busy as director of Homeland Security actually I don't think I don't
[01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:04.240]  think the mayor will join the government I don't think he has an interest in

[01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:09.960]  through three o'clock today that he's in on an airplane I tell me I should
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:13.040]  celebrate you know he was big buddies with Nixon they reported one of his
[01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:17.880]  best friends after he was out of office and Nixon could never savor anything or
[01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:24.760]  ever appreciate you a victory look I do I love everybody but it makes me love the
[01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:29.000]  country and you that much more and it makes me so frustrated because I see
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:33.080]  them all this race spading crap and in just the division and making stuff up
[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:36.760]  and I really want people to come together and so I just get mad you know
[01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:40.760]  Van Jones saying this is a white backlash and all this crap this was a
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:45.160]  backlash against NAFTA and GATT it was a backlash against the mainstream media I
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:51.040]  mean the truth is Trump is not even conservative okay he's a populist and
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:57.200]  thank God I can't stand Paul Ryan I can't stand the horrible Republican filthy
[01:54:57.200 --> 01:55:00.680]  establishment they're just as bad as the Democrats and here's an article in

[01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:38.120]  for everything you've done other little I mean I know you'll more than you'll
[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:41.440]  know more in the days and weeks to come but other little factoids or tidbits we
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:48.320]  should know. Oh listen anybody who is upset any Democrat who is upset that
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:55.360]  Trump is the winner has the DNC to blame. WikiLeaks email number 1120 look at
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:59.560]  the attachment to that it is a DNC strategy session where they are working
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:04.320]  to elevate Trump as the frontrunner because they feel he will be easier to
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:09.960]  beat. They care for what you wish for folks then they ended up you know
[01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:15.440]  completely screwing Bernie Sanders and doing all kinds of tampering with that.
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:19.840]  They pushed down the candidate that people wanted they gave the people a
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:23.680]  candidate they didn't want and then they elevated a different candidate
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:29.240]  artificially. If you want to point fingers somebody because you're a
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:35.200]  Democrat and you're upset about this look to the DNC because that's right and
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:39.760]  well it shows their disconnect. That's the responsibility right there. Bev I agree
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:44.800]  I mean it shows the disconnect that a they thought someone brazen and brash and
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:49.280]  Americana would would would be negative they're in their own echo chamber they
[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:54.600]  have the opposite of the minus touch. Yeah I just I mean I guess that email has
[01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:59.200]  been reported as well but I happen to find it kind of by accident I just went
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:04.440]  oh my goodness it's it's I think it's April 2015 and they're all having a
[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:08.440]  strategy session as to how to elevate Trump and they're saying because we're
[01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:12.920]  worried about Bush and we're worried about Cruz or worried about Rubio. No I mean
[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:15.800]  that is a real one you're right we've covered it as far as you talked about it.
[01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:24.920]  Yeah yeah so so okay and now I would talk about a judgment problem. People have a
[01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:28.280]  judgment problem. Bev Harris you're amazing can't wait to have you back up
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:32.520]  can't wait to have you back up soon to give us more postmortem analysis thank
[01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:37.240]  you so much we'll be right back with Roger Stone, Steve Pachennick.
[01:58:37.240 --> 01:58:47.640]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:47.640 --> 01:58:52.240]  A staunch anti-fetalist Patrick Henry was opposed to the Constitution fearing it
[01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:55.680]  would become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that
[01:58:55.680 --> 01:58:59.560]  had created it but that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty. His
[01:58:59.560 --> 01:59:04.160]  warnings ignored have now come to pass. He said you're not to inquire how your
[01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:08.720]  trade may be increased nor how you were to become a great and powerful people but
[01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:13.040]  how your liberties can be secured. For liberty ought to be the direct end of
[01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:17.000]  your government. Patrick Henry warned us the liberties of a people never were nor
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:20.480]  ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be
[01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:24.800]  concealed from them. Today everything the government does at every level is
[01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:29.120]  concealed from us. We have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our
[01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:32.760]  elected representatives are allowed to see. Later in life Patrick Henry looked
[01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:36.800]  back and said when the American spirit was in its youth the language of America
[01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:41.480]  was different. Liberty, sir, was the primary object. Today our primary concern
[01:59:41.480 --> 01:59:45.480]  is safety and comfort when we should be demanding liberty.
[01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:49.520]  For NFOWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:59:49.520 --> 02:00:13.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:21.280]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. You're listening to the
[02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:26.840]  Alex Jones show. Well the former spy chief and head of psychological warfare
[02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:31.760]  and co-founder of Delta Force Dr. Steve Pachennick is joining us coming up and
[02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:34.680]  there has been a rebellion in the intelligence community. The media tries
[02:00:34.680 --> 02:00:37.800]  to misrepresent that claim you know while Pachennick isn't running the
[02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:40.600]  movement he never said he was. The point is it's just people everywhere. We're
[02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:44.120]  the movement. You're the movement. Citizens are everybody. Human. We're just
[02:00:44.120 --> 02:00:48.200]  citizens here fighting a globalist takeover like the French resistance or
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:51.600]  something. This is real. Roger Stone's here. Pachennick's coming up the next
[02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:55.120]  segment. He's riding the shot down with us the next two hours. Take a little break
[02:00:55.120 --> 02:00:59.240]  for some lunch in a little while. We're getting Roger some lunch. But Roger, wow.
[02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:03.240]  Do you agree we need to go after them? They need to be punished. They need to go
[02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:08.480]  to jail. Not out of vindictiveness. Justice must be served. Plus this is day of
[02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:11.360]  the dead. These zombies are going to keep coming back at us until their brains
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:14.600]  have been released. Well first let me address something Bev said because I
[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:18.200]  think it's crucially important because we've seen this before. If you read
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:24.120]  Hamilton Jordan's biography there's a whole section on how Jimmy Carter wanted
[02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:27.920]  to run against Ronald Reagan. Thought he was a simpleton. Oh you said this a few
[02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:31.440]  months ago. Thought that he was imminently beatable. We saw the same
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:37.440]  thing here where if you look at the returns in Detroit, in Milwaukee, in
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:43.120]  Pittsburgh for example. Replay of Reagan. No other Republican could have won this.
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:47.960]  Had we nominated a conventional establishment Republican you would
[02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:52.120]  have gotten the traditional Republican vote in those places and we would have
[02:01:52.120 --> 02:01:57.400]  lost. Only Trump could have won this. So again Bev's right. Be careful what you
[02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:01.040]  wish for. Why are they so incompetent? I knew Trump was the strongest from the
[02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:04.680]  beginning. Because they're elitists. They don't understand working people. They
[02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:08.120]  don't understand how average people think and they don't understand their values
[02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:13.400]  and they never understood Trump's appeal to working people. He speaks the
[02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:16.720]  language. We want to go eat a hamburger and drink a beer. They want to go
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:19.320]  devil worship and drink blood. They're just they're just they're just
[02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:24.880]  disconnected. Exactly. Now the other thing to go to your point is Trump is a
[02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:29.040]  man who means what he says and says what he means. You watch the debates you can
[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:33.360]  you can run them back down and rewatch them. He's going to seek justice for
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:36.840]  those who have broken the law. Now he doesn't think that he unilaterally can
[02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:41.760]  wave a wand and say Hillary should be sent to jail. There's a process but they
[02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:47.160]  have avoided the process for 40 years and now it is time for it all to catch up
[02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:51.080]  with them. They need to be put through the judicial process. The Clinton
[02:02:51.080 --> 02:02:54.800]  Foundation is not a charity. It's a money laundering. It's a slush fund for
[02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:58.200]  grifters. But don't we have the total proof with the WikiLeaks from three weeks
[02:02:58.200 --> 02:03:01.760]  ago where we got to cover the suburbs like 15 of them that I saw. We got to cover
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:04.400]  it up for POTUS. He's in secret communication with this illegal thing.
[02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:07.120]  This is like God we're all screwed. They're on court or whatever. This is
[02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:09.760]  totally illegal. We have them running around admitting they're committing
[02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:13.760]  crime. So dumb on emails that admitting they want to cover it up. I mean we it's
[02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:17.600]  open and shut. We've always had the evidence. What we haven't had is an
[02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:21.920]  honest prosecutor who will take it to a grand jury so the justice can be done.
[02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:26.400]  Now I think you will finally have that. This we now go into what I think is a
[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:33.480]  crucial period because personnel is policy and the president-elect needs to
[02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:39.040]  choose people who reflect his worldview, who reflect his mindset. No more
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:44.240]  old guard. He needs to get patriots, new people, folks from the outside. He needs
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:49.160]  to get business people, doctors. He needs to get a wide spectrum. But and he needs
[02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:54.120]  to avoid globalists. He needs to avoid neocons. He needs to avoid those who are
[02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:58.360]  tied to the mistakes of the past. He needs a fresh team. Tell folks how pathetic
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:01.360]  the mainstream media is. Famous people just on your phone are calling, calling,
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:04.440]  calling Democrats who've been attacking. Now they suddenly are kissing your ass,
[02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:09.240]  asking for jobs. The job seekers now come out of the woodwork. First there's the
[02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:13.320]  Republican job seekers. Those who were never for Trump. They're the ones calling
[02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:17.960]  to say I was with you the whole time. Can you send my resume? Can you send my
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:22.160]  resume? Then you've got the reporters who wouldn't give you the time of day who
[02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:26.300]  misrepresented what you said, who attacked you. Now they want to know if they
[02:04:26.300 --> 02:04:30.720]  can get an interview with Donald Trump. This is the way the world works. This is
[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:35.800]  why I left Washington when I did. Washington is the phoniest place on
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:39.160]  the planet. If you want to meet real people, you got a better chance in
[02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:43.520]  Hollywood. Well exactly and I want to just say this. What am I asking for from
[02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:49.000]  Trump? Just be true. Restore the Republic. Cut taxes. Cut the debt. Unify the
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:54.120]  nation. I'm not asking for anything. Just do what you said you'd do. Please, for
[02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:57.600]  my children, we'll be back. Stay with us.
[02:04:57.600 --> 02:05:02.200]  A staunch anti-Federalist, Patrick Henry was opposed to the Constitution fearing it
[02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:05.640]  would become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that
[02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:09.520]  had created it, but that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty. His
[02:05:09.520 --> 02:05:14.120]  warnings, ignored, have now come to pass. He said you're not to inquire how your
[02:05:14.120 --> 02:05:18.440]  trade may be increased, nor how you were to become a great and powerful people,
[02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:23.000]  but how your liberties can be secured. For liberty ought to be the direct end of
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:26.600]  your government. Patrick Henry warned us the liberties of a people never were,
[02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:30.480]  nor ever will be secure, when the transactions of their rulers may be
[02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:34.760]  concealed from them. Today everything the government does at every level is
[02:05:34.760 --> 02:05:39.080]  concealed from us. We have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our
[02:05:39.080 --> 02:05:42.720]  elected representatives are allowed to see. Later in life, Patrick Henry looked
[02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:46.760]  back and said when the American spirit was in its youth, the language of America
[02:05:46.760 --> 02:05:51.440]  was different. Liberty, sir, was the primary object. Today, our primary concern
[02:05:51.440 --> 02:05:55.320]  is safety and comfort, when we should be demanding liberty.
[02:05:55.320 --> 02:05:58.560]  RenforWars.com, I'm David Knight. Hey everyone,
[02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:02.160]  pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm
[02:06:02.160 --> 02:06:05.600]  on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy. You've all heard the
[02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:09.000]  shocking statistics, despite spending trillions of dollars in health care
[02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:14.400]  nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country. Obesity, diabetes, cancer,
[02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:18.200]  heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant. One out of three or four
[02:06:18.200 --> 02:06:21.080]  people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at
[02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:24.840]  least one person with a degenerative disease. If you're dealing with a health
[02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:27.600]  challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity,
[02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:31.200]  and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw

[02:06:57.240 --> 02:07:00.920]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us. It took you over a year to do it.
[02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:05.320]  Why is this so good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem that
[02:07:05.320 --> 02:07:10.160]  pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put
[02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:14.320]  toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're
[02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:19.520]  dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that
[02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:24.240]  lives off a host mechanism. Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease
[02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:28.680]  around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[02:07:28.680 --> 02:07:31.680]  Tell us about all the stuff I said. There's so many things that are in it. You have the
[02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:36.320]  name in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend
[02:07:36.320 --> 02:07:40.040]  doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year. All right, well, I'm glad we've got
[02:07:40.040 --> 02:07:42.720]  something back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in
[02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:46.680]  yesterday. Living Defense, infowarsteam.com. And folks, you can't lose full of
[02:07:46.680 --> 02:07:51.760]  stuff that's great for your body, period. And you support the broadcast, infowarsteam.com.
[02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:55.160]  Thank you, Dr. Grip, from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all
[02:07:55.160 --> 02:08:09.640]  your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:08:09.640 --> 02:08:19.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show. The election came. We won. It's now November
[02:08:19.160 --> 02:08:29.360]  9th, 2016. I'm your host, Alex Jones, and history is now being made. Never underestimate
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:36.760]  the arrogance of the Washington bureaucrat and a banker class. They created this con
[02:08:36.760 --> 02:08:42.360]  that they were invincible. Now that America has tasted victory again, the
[02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:48.040]  spirit of the Republic is rising. Dr. C. Pacinic is with us for the next 40
[02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:52.000]  minutes or so, then Larry Nichols, who is just proven to be so dead on, is going
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:55.440]  to be joining us. David Nye continues on. And we've decided, whatever crew wants to
[02:08:55.440 --> 02:08:58.600]  stay, there's no pressure. We're going to just continue, not 52 hours, we're
[02:08:58.600 --> 02:09:01.640]  going to continue broadcasting right through tonight till as long as we can
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:04.960]  stay here. Because that's what it's all about, ladies and gentlemen. And you're
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:08.400]  here by the tens of millions. I haven't checked the numbers. In the first 30
[02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:13.440]  something hours, we had 27 million people just on Facebook and YouTube and on
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:19.880]  our own streams, just on Facebook before it was like 10 million or more. Again,
[02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:24.800]  that's not even our main platforms. I had to kind of pistol whip around here, folks
[02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:28.760]  to make people start putting our videos on Facebook six months ago. I'm joking
[02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:32.840]  when I say that, that actually buggy whip people. But the point is, is that very
[02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:37.200]  exciting things are happening. We are ace of spades every time royal flush
[02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:43.520]  blowing the living daylights out of them. But we have to prosecute them. These
[02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:49.160]  rats are not ever going to back off now. They are, they've always hated us
[02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:51.960]  because they know we're colossals compared to them. We're not here to
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:54.840]  screw people over. They're mentally ill and want to pull everything down
[02:09:54.840 --> 02:09:58.320]  because they're so spiritually ugly. Now, Roger shows right a shot done with us
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:01.520]  throughout the broadcast days, flying back out later this afternoon. I want to
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:04.320]  do some end up talks with him, but this is all kind of co hosting here. Just
[02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:07.320]  briefly because they keep telling me this. Yeah, I just want to hire four or five
[02:10:07.320 --> 02:10:10.520]  more reporters and crew members and pay the bills around here. You need to plug,
[02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:13.800]  which I haven't done in days, our sponsors, and you need to stop skipping
[02:10:13.800 --> 02:10:18.080]  breaks. And you need to do. I got 10 years and telling me this from Minnesota.
[02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:21.080]  I got them telling me and I'm not bitching. I'm just saying, refuel us.
[02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:26.280]  There isn't anywhere where you can buy products that are better. We go out to
[02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:29.960]  the top producers and say, we want the most ridiculously high quality and we're
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:32.800]  going to have it at a low price. And they just go, no one does this. Well, we
[02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:37.080]  need it. Okay. Whether it's X2, whether it's DNA for free shipping, store wide,
[02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:41.440]  free shipping, store wide info wars, live.com info or short.com's umbrella
[02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:46.240]  site on non GMO seeds, high quality, durable food, everything there info or
[02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:51.600]  store.com or 888-2533139 and Donald Trump has said it and the media tried to
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:54.960]  hang it like an albatross around his neck. I'm not bragging. It really is true.
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:11:01.680]  Info wars is at the absolute core of the rediscovery of America and the American
[02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:06.760]  system in 1776. Not because I invented any of this, but because I rediscovered
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:11.520]  what America was in life and in the history books and more. And then for 20
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:15.240]  plus years I've been in the trenches learning this from every angle and
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:18.560]  developing a knowledge base that no one else really has. Other people have
[02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:21.560]  knowledge bases that I don't have. I'm not saying I'm some grandpa. Let's just
[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:25.240]  say this, this brain trust is being given to everybody and you're adding to it
[02:11:25.240 --> 02:11:32.040]  like a like a like a electrochemical supercomputer that's interfaced with the
[02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:37.920]  silicon world. This is the new true AI system is we the people interface in the
[02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:42.000]  new media and overthrowing the entire technocracy. They believe would be our
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:45.680]  enslavement. It will now be the delivery system to Valhalla, but we have to take
[02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:49.720]  it in our hands. That's not utopia. I'm promising that's reality, but it's an
[02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:53.960]  animating contest. Now we will not be teleported there on a bed of roses as
[02:11:53.960 --> 02:12:00.320]  Thomas Jefferson said. InfoWarsStore.com is the energy on cubes we need. It's the
[02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:04.440]  fuel. You get high quality products. It's symbiotic. There are things you need to
[02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:09.480]  reuse and have again just like we need to continue on. Breathing as the seasons
[02:12:09.480 --> 02:12:14.800]  pass as the planet orbits. InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com, StevePachennic.com is
[02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:18.640]  his great website. He's joining us right now, popping in and of course we have
[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:22.160]  Roger Stone here jumping anytime Roger, but what an incredible time. Now
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:25.880]  Pachennic we're co-hosting. Just give us little little nuggets of where you see
[02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:30.400]  this going, what's unfolded. You know, we talked this weekend and I said I thought
[02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:33.200]  Trump was gonna win. I mean I knew they were gonna try to steal it and I had a
[02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:36.520]  bad feeling and Bev Harris was on. She's a liberal. She said clearly they tried to
[02:12:36.520 --> 02:12:41.400]  steal it, but the tsunami was so big that it defeated him. So I think now
[02:12:41.400 --> 02:12:45.200]  asking you what do we do next, I want your view. I mean clearly do you think we
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:50.040]  should just let Hillary sail off into the sunset? Clearly not. First of all I want
[02:12:50.040 --> 02:12:56.760]  to congratulate you Alex and Roger for really initiating this American
[02:12:56.760 --> 02:13:02.520]  Revolution. It was not easy. It's an important idea that people have to
[02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:08.840]  understand that this was initiated by what we call the alternative media. Roger
[02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:13.520]  and I had worked under Reagan. We had worked under other presidents Nixon, but
[02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:17.840]  this is really a revolution and this was a revolution that people should
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:24.040]  understand. Initiate it through your auspices, plus Roger interceding, my
[02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:30.760]  coming in, but it also belongs to the men and women who are in our intelligence
[02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:36.160]  service, our military intelligence, our civilian intelligence. Had they not
[02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:40.880]  performed, we would not have been at this position and I can't tell you how
[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:46.800]  important they have been to the integrity of the Republic. It's not just the men and
[02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:51.640]  women who carry guns and fight our wars, the kinetic wars. This is a new kind of
[02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:59.960]  war. And let me tell you in 1973 I was fortunate enough under the GI Bill to not
[02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:05.160]  only attend Harvard but MIT. Not because I was so smart, but because I understood
[02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:09.160]  that at MIT they were going to teach me something that had never been taught
[02:14:09.160 --> 02:14:15.800]  before and that was the internet and social media. 1973. My dad was at UT in
[02:14:15.800 --> 02:14:20.360]  the 60s and they were talking about CD-ROM and social media then as well in the
[02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:23.560]  plan 2 program when he was in high school and of course you know that was a
[02:14:23.560 --> 02:14:28.840]  secret DARPA program. That's exactly it. So we have to thank DARPA, Defense
[02:14:28.840 --> 02:14:34.440]  Advanced Research Projects Agency and even the CIA for having initiated this
[02:14:34.440 --> 02:14:40.400]  type of modality that nobody could conceive. 50 years later we have been
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:46.640]  able to utilize that using you, Roger, many others and the internet to literally
[02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:52.640]  have a coup which the Clintons did and attempted it and there was a counter
[02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:57.360]  coup. There's no question about it. Without soldiers, without tanks, as Roger
[02:14:57.360 --> 02:15:02.400]  said, you know the old line Republicans were useless. We were able to kick them
[02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:07.760]  out and in turn what happened was the Republic answered in a way that we'd
[02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:12.400]  never seen before. The voices that came through you, through the protests, the
[02:15:12.400 --> 02:15:16.680]  meetings that they went to with Donald Trump and the fact that Donald could
[02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:22.720]  articulate our discontent and maintain it at a phenomenal rate that even I was
[02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:27.400]  done. I gotta tell you as a doctor, psychiatrist, I've never seen anybody like
[02:15:27.400 --> 02:15:32.560]  Donald Trump. He was tireless. I mean I had to go to bed at midnight one in the
[02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:37.760]  morning because I figured, oh, you know, this will keep on going. But truthfully, we
[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:43.240]  owe a great gratitude to the family, the Trump family, to all the
[02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:47.280]  people around him. They're warriors, they're warriors and Roger Stone here with
[02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:51.280]  us, former Trump campaign had he's got... Well, Roger's an old line warrior. I mean he
[02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:56.080]  and I worked for Nixon. I had a great, great respect for Nixon and as I said
[02:15:56.080 --> 02:16:00.360]  to a friend of mine who's not meeting with Rumsfeld, I said the spirit of
[02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:04.840]  Nixon and I came in later on. Roger was far more involved with Nixon than I did.
[02:16:04.840 --> 02:16:09.200]  I really came in towards the end and then the Ford administration. But Nixon
[02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:14.760]  communicated with me and that man was a genius. I mean people really only
[02:16:14.760 --> 02:16:19.360]  understand Watergate but they don't understand how brilliant he was and he
[02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:25.360]  was a poor man. He grew up as a Quaker. He watched his brother get
[02:16:25.360 --> 02:16:29.760]  killed. He grew up with all kinds of problems that he was able to...
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:32.880]  Reportedly, Stone was like best friends with Nixon after he got out of the office.
[02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:36.920]  That's what the New York Times says. I admire him and I understand that. He never
[02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:41.160]  lined his pockets. He never used his position in government to enrich himself.
[02:16:41.160 --> 02:16:46.840]  They tried to say that in Watergate. It was false. He was above all a patriot. He
[02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:52.200]  was for a strong America. He was for peace and he paid the ultimate price for it.
[02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:56.440]  But he made mistakes. There's no question. Closing the gold window.
[02:16:56.440 --> 02:17:00.880]  Enormous mistake. The war on drugs. Enormous... He wasn't a demon. You had a
[02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:06.200]  question from a child. He was a patriot. He was a patriot. Ironically, the liberals
[02:17:06.200 --> 02:17:10.160]  come up to me and say, oh my god, I didn't know that Nixon had created the
[02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:14.640]  Environmental Protection Agency. I didn't know Nixon had initiated NIDA,
[02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:19.440]  National Institute for Drug Abuse. I said, yeah, it doesn't mean we're all
[02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:27.480]  right-wing neocons. See, one thing interests me and that was the the the
[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:35.960]  by play of last Friday and Monday. Like you, I have very good sources in the
[02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:42.960]  New York Police Department. They assured me that the treasure trove of 650,000
[02:17:42.960 --> 02:17:49.720]  documents that were found on the Huma Abedin Anthony Weiner server were
[02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:55.200]  political and legal dynamite. I mean just evidence of treason, evidence of
[02:17:55.200 --> 02:17:59.600]  corruption, evidence of crime, sex compromising, evidence of pay for play,
[02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:06.360]  evidence of sexual blackmail, and so on. So how is it that the FBI director who
[02:18:06.360 --> 02:18:11.320]  took months to go through 33,000 emails could say, oh, we've been through all
[02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:15.000]  this and there's nothing there? That's my next question for both of you. I was
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:18.600]  told by sources and why did no one that they told Hillary you better not try to
[02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:21.720]  steal it. Well, we're gonna bring all this out.
[02:18:21.720 --> 02:18:26.880]  Roger has a key point that I will answer. Roger understands this because we've
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:32.080]  been in several administrations. Fear and collusion are one of the greatest
[02:18:32.080 --> 02:18:38.360]  dynamics that you have in politics and the Clintons were able to collude with
[02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:43.920]  Loretta Lynch and James Comey. The reason why Roger, he had to come out is
[02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:48.560]  because thanks to our military people, our people in the intelligence community
[02:18:48.560 --> 02:18:52.960]  who were sick and tired of his acquiescence, of Comey's acquiescence,
[02:18:52.960 --> 02:18:57.960]  they allowed a lot of the emails to go literally right through WikiLeaks and we
[02:18:57.960 --> 02:19:04.040]  have to give a kudo to Julian Assange who really... Who is the MVP? I mean is Julian Assange even more
[02:19:04.040 --> 02:19:14.440]  key? I mean Trump's the MVP. If I were Trump, I would give him a part and ask him to
[02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:18.000]  come to the United States and give him American citizenship. Isn't it time to bring
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:22.920]  Snowden back? That's a different issue. They agree. That's a different issue. But I
[02:19:22.920 --> 02:19:28.160]  agree with you on Assange. I would offer him a pardon. Look, they threaten to kill
[02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:31.600]  this guy. They threaten to drone him. They put pressure on the British
[02:19:31.600 --> 02:19:36.960]  government to actually withdraw the diplomatic recognition of Ecuador so
[02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:40.240]  they could rush the embassy and arrest him because he was the man with the...
[02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:42.400]  All right guys, stay there. We're gonna come back. I want to ask you guys you
[02:19:42.400 --> 02:19:46.520]  quick questions, quick answers. How do they strike back? This nest of
[02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:50.240]  globalists, George Soros and others. I know we're all celebrating here but I mean
[02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:53.080]  we just want a big battle but we're still, you know, got more attack ships
[02:19:53.080 --> 02:20:02.160]  coming and so I want to win. I want to win it all. Stay with us.

[02:22:00.040 --> 02:22:03.520]  sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water. If your current plan
[02:22:03.520 --> 02:22:07.440]  includes using a fuel burning stove or cooking over an open fire then there's
[02:22:07.440 --> 02:22:11.600]  a much better way. The Miniman rocket stove is a biomass burning cooking stove
[02:22:11.600 --> 02:22:15.600]  that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel. The Miniman

[02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:39.200]  When I was a boy it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage and beef was for supper.

[02:22:57.200 --> 02:23:00.720]  There is an affordable alternative to the high cost of health care that offers

[02:23:57.200 --> 02:24:10.200]  By the way, I'm not obsessing post-mortem here on who the MVP is. I want to know
[02:24:10.200 --> 02:24:15.200]  who's the most effective. Drudge overall, punching through narratives, showing the truth,
[02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:19.200]  giving people a palette of reality to make their own decisions outside of the
[02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:26.200]  echo chamber of MSM. Obviously Julian Assange, Briggsit and Nigel Farage and
[02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:31.200]  breaking away, it's like planets aligning. The stuff Roger Stone did behind the scenes
[02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:35.200]  is epic. The intelligence community, the patriots. But I got to say Julian Assange,
[02:24:35.200 --> 02:24:40.200]  I think hands down, Julian Assange, just the WikiLeaks and that ties in the intelligence
[02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:47.200]  community and patriots and whistleblowing. I think whistleblowers are the MVPs.
[02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:51.200]  And so when I say Assange, he's the arc type of that, but really it is those
[02:24:51.200 --> 02:24:56.200]  whistleblowers are the MVPs, giving us a window into these nasty, globalist
[02:24:56.200 --> 02:25:02.200]  activities, bringing salt to the earth, you know, absolutely bringing the truth out.
[02:25:02.200 --> 02:25:05.200]  Dr. Steve Pochenick, you think that's an accurate statement? The MVPs in this
[02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:08.200]  revolution against tyranny are the whistleblowers?
[02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:16.200]  Well, let me be frank. I think all of you are the MVPs. Julian is part and parcel
[02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:21.200]  of a revolution that started way before Julian even knew this revolution was there.
[02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:27.200]  And quite frankly, it's you and others who sat there in the alternative media,
[02:25:27.200 --> 02:25:32.200]  which was called the alternative media, which will now become the mainstream media
[02:25:32.200 --> 02:25:37.200]  because the mainstream media is finished. What happened in this revolution are several things.
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:42.200]  Number one, the mainstream media is finished. The Clinton Foundation will be disbanded.
[02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:46.200]  By the way, I got to stop you. We're not just saying this. We now have to really
[02:25:46.200 --> 02:25:50.200]  up our game. They're gone. This is really happening.
[02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:55.200]  It's happening, but nobody's gone until they're gone. And remember, even in the
[02:25:55.200 --> 02:26:00.200]  French Revolution, it got out of control. And one of the reasons that I have to be
[02:26:00.200 --> 02:26:06.200]  very careful about what we say and do is that we need to put in place what Reagan
[02:26:06.200 --> 02:26:11.200]  had in place and what Nixon had in place, a very effective team of very bright
[02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:16.200]  individuals who are not just loyalists, but who can implement now.
[02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:20.200]  Trump has a very effective team. That's right. Let's talk about everybody wants to celebrate.
[02:26:20.200 --> 02:26:25.200]  OK, let's celebrate by winning. Roger, real quick. And then you get to ride shotgun with us.
[02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:29.200]  I mean, just real fast. In 60 seconds each. What does Trump do next exactly to make
[02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:33.200]  sure they don't undermine him? I think you should stop all this dangerous public
[02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:37.200]  events for a while. We need to get in first because I think they're going to try to kill him.
[02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:43.200]  I have a concern about his personal security. I pray for his safety, as does my family.
[02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:49.200]  But above all, he needs to be careful to choose people who reflect his views.
[02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:53.200]  This is the section. Steve, you've seen this where they come out of the woodwork,
[02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:59.200]  the job seekers, the courtiers, the brown nosers, the bootleckers, and they explain
[02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:03.200]  to you how helpful they were to you when, in fact, they did nothing to help you get elected.
[02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:07.200]  And that's how you're going to infiltrate it. It's not just that they suck.
[02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:11.200]  Roger is absolutely correct. And he mentioned the one particular group, the Neal Conservatives,
[02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:15.200]  the ones who came out like Steve Hadley, Richard Perle, Wolfowitz, Sandy Berger,
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:19.200]  Piyama, a whole group of them who were exceedingly dangerous under Bush.
[02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:23.200]  Junior, who came out and said, we want to make America number one.
[02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:27.200]  They're the folks working with the Islamists that blew up the towers.
[02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:31.200]  Now they are very dangerous. They cannot be in this administration.
[02:27:31.200 --> 02:27:36.200]  And that's kind of a warning to everyone that there will be no neocons involved,
[02:27:36.200 --> 02:27:42.200]  including ancillary individuals, particularly in the Defense Department and the National Security Area.
[02:27:42.200 --> 02:27:46.200]  It cannot happen. And Roger understands this and I understand it.
[02:27:46.200 --> 02:27:53.200]  This revolution really came out as a revolution against the neocons and what happened in 9-11.
[02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:57.200]  Let me ask you this. I do want to go to the MVP question because it's important.
[02:27:57.200 --> 02:28:02.200]  And there's somebody who isn't on our list so far because I agree with you, Alex,
[02:28:02.200 --> 02:28:05.200]  that drudge a crucial player here in what has.
[02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:06.200]  Breitbart.
[02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:07.200]  Breitbart.
[02:28:07.200 --> 02:28:08.200]  Bannon.
[02:28:08.200 --> 02:28:13.200]  But Steve Bannon, more than anyone else who had an acute understanding of the new media,
[02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:16.200]  something the campaign lacked until he joined.
[02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:20.200]  I and I have missed communications with him this morning.
[02:28:20.200 --> 02:28:23.200]  But I think he should be the chief of staff.
[02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:27.200]  To reach him, I'm going to urge him to seek that job.
[02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:33.200]  I think he has the big picture viewpoint that Trump needs.
[02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:36.200]  He knows exactly who the bad guys are.
[02:28:36.200 --> 02:28:41.200]  He knows exactly who those who really helped win this victory are.
[02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:42.200]  He understands the value.
[02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:43.200]  And he should run the henhouse.
[02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:49.200]  And he understands the value of infowars.com and the fact that Alex has been the tip of the spear.
[02:28:49.200 --> 02:28:53.200]  That Alex has been resistance central.
[02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:57.200]  He is deeply appreciative of everything that's happened here.
[02:28:57.200 --> 02:29:03.200]  He is the right man to be the gatekeeper because the gatekeeper, as Steve knows, is crucial.
[02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:08.200]  Who gets in to see the president whose paper gets on the president's desk is now.
[02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:09.200]  And that's why they're crapping their drawers.
[02:29:09.200 --> 02:29:11.200]  We'll come back with Pachett and give him the floor and then let him go.
[02:29:11.200 --> 02:29:15.200]  That's why they're crapping their drawers because Steve Bannon is a patriot.
[02:29:15.200 --> 02:29:18.200]  He knows cutting taxes will help people.
[02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:20.200]  He knows he's an American.
[02:29:20.200 --> 02:29:21.200]  I mean, that's all we want is just somebody.
[02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:23.200]  And so they're crapping their pants.
[02:29:23.200 --> 02:29:27.200]  We'll see what Pachett thinks is most important straight ahead and what the next chapter of this is.
[02:29:27.200 --> 02:29:29.200]  Because everybody wants to celebrate and that's great.
[02:29:29.200 --> 02:29:33.200]  But, you know, if you're celebrating this win, we're going to lose the next war.
[02:29:33.200 --> 02:29:34.200]  Everybody can celebrate.
[02:29:34.200 --> 02:29:35.200]  That's wonderful.
[02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:36.200]  But I love this so much.
[02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:38.200]  We have to win the next 10 battles.
[02:29:38.200 --> 02:29:42.200]  And it gets easier as we tap in the 1776 power.
[02:29:42.200 --> 02:29:43.200]  Stay with us.
[02:29:43.200 --> 02:29:44.200]  It's got problems.
[02:29:44.200 --> 02:29:47.200]  You've got to kneel to it.
[02:29:47.200 --> 02:29:49.200]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.200 --> 02:29:51.200]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.200 --> 02:29:58.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.200 --> 02:30:01.200]  I want to tell you about a brand new often read product.
[02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:03.200]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:05.200]  Even though it's so small, you can put it in your pocket.
[02:30:05.200 --> 02:30:09.200]  It can actually run some 110 appliances at your house.
[02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:12.200]  Like small refrigerators to keep your food from spoiling.
[02:30:12.200 --> 02:30:14.200]  The best part, though, you can take it with you.
[02:30:14.200 --> 02:30:20.200]  It's mobile to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[02:30:20.200 --> 02:30:24.200]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity.
[02:30:24.200 --> 02:30:27.200]  Basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[02:30:27.200 --> 02:30:28.200]  A true innovation.
[02:30:28.200 --> 02:30:30.200]  I have never seen anything like this.
[02:30:30.200 --> 02:30:32.200]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[02:30:32.200 --> 02:30:35.200]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[02:30:35.200 --> 02:30:39.200]  It's even a great Christmas idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.
[02:30:39.200 --> 02:30:41.200]  Go to privatepowergrid.com.
[02:30:41.200 --> 02:30:43.200]  That's privatepowergrid.com.

[02:31:04.200 --> 02:31:06.200]  Yes, the gift of clean water.
[02:31:06.200 --> 02:31:10.200]  A gift that provides a great foundation for achieving good health in the lives of your loved ones.
[02:31:10.200 --> 02:31:18.200]  A big Berkey water filter gives them protection from bacteria, heavy metals, chlorine, fluoride, pesticides and herbicides, VOCs and more.
[02:31:18.200 --> 02:31:23.200]  And best of all, a big Berkey water filter is a gift that lasts for many years with no additional investment.
[02:31:23.200 --> 02:31:27.200]  And that saves time and money in filter replacements that other water filters require.
[02:31:27.200 --> 02:31:33.200]  And are even powerful enough to purify treated, untreated, or even stagnant pond water.

[02:31:55.200 --> 02:32:10.200]  Give a big Berkey water filter.
[02:32:26.200 --> 02:32:28.200]  Happiness is 5starsoap.com.

[02:33:50.200 --> 02:34:06.200]  Well, I tell you, a lot of great things are happening right now.
[02:34:06.200 --> 02:34:09.200]  We have the Albion Sword.
[02:34:09.200 --> 02:34:11.200]  I mean, this is the Republic.
[02:34:11.200 --> 02:34:14.200]  This is the New Atlantis.
[02:34:14.200 --> 02:34:16.200]  That's what our founders tried to create.
[02:34:16.200 --> 02:34:19.200]  It was a system to be based on liberty and freedom.
[02:34:19.200 --> 02:34:22.200]  The West is where the liberty came from.
[02:34:22.200 --> 02:34:29.200]  And now we have the social justice warriors and the social engineers trying to shut that down because they can't compete with real liberalism.
[02:34:29.200 --> 02:34:32.200]  And they've changed all the terms and scrambled it all.
[02:34:32.200 --> 02:34:36.200]  But this is a really last chance, I think.
[02:34:36.200 --> 02:34:37.200]  Trump has to deliver.
[02:34:37.200 --> 02:34:39.200]  I want to start to put you on this than you, Roger.
[02:34:39.200 --> 02:34:41.200]  And then we're going to get Larry Nichols on.
[02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:43.200]  Trump has to deliver.
[02:34:43.200 --> 02:34:45.200]  But what is delivering?
[02:34:45.200 --> 02:34:47.200]  And what else does he do to surround himself?
[02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:49.200]  You're absolutely right.
[02:34:49.200 --> 02:34:56.200]  With the generals, not the PR BSers and not the folks who want to be on red carpets and fly around with a bunch of jackasses, you know, and rock stars.
[02:34:56.200 --> 02:35:03.200]  We need real men and women that are dedicated to the return of America.
[02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:04.200]  Dr. Brough.
[02:35:04.200 --> 02:35:10.200]  What he needs to do is to first appoint those people who can clean out the system.
[02:35:10.200 --> 02:35:13.200]  In particular, you have to go into the FBI again.
[02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:15.200]  You have to go into the Justice Department.
[02:35:15.200 --> 02:35:25.200]  If Giuliani comes in, I remember him under the Reagan administration, he did a formidable job against all the banking elites, Drexel Burnham and others.
[02:35:25.200 --> 02:35:31.200]  If he comes in, then the IRS has to be reevaluated and reconfigured.
[02:35:31.200 --> 02:35:41.200]  And then if the sheriff comes in to do Homeland Security, that would be important to clean it out and reconstitute it.
[02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:44.200]  So you're going to have to decrease the size of our government.
[02:35:44.200 --> 02:35:48.200]  You have to have people, what I used to do and still do is a sweeper.
[02:35:48.200 --> 02:35:53.200]  You come in and you clean out every institution and not give that individual a particular job.
[02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:58.200]  He comes in, he sweeps it out and basically reconstitutes it very quickly.
[02:35:58.200 --> 02:36:00.200]  I did it on the Reagan administration.
[02:36:00.200 --> 02:36:02.200]  I did it under the other administrations.
[02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:06.200]  But you need that kind of fixer or sweeper that Roger knows about.
[02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:09.200]  And we go in there and we tighten it from the White House.
[02:36:09.200 --> 02:36:13.200]  Nixon had a very effective team in the White House.
[02:36:13.200 --> 02:36:19.200]  So that when they came in and they overran the bureaucracy, he knew exactly what was happening.
[02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:21.200]  And is that why the elite hated Nixon?
[02:36:21.200 --> 02:36:23.200]  I think Steve has put his finger on it.
[02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:29.200]  Immediately after the 1972 election, Nixon went to Camp David, took his top aides with him,
[02:36:29.200 --> 02:36:36.200]  and they just hunkered down for a week and wrote a plan to completely clean out the federal bureaucracy.
[02:36:36.200 --> 02:36:42.200]  Top to bottom, CIA, FBI, Justice Department, particularly all the social agencies.
[02:36:42.200 --> 02:36:45.200]  This is what scared the Washington establishment.
[02:36:45.200 --> 02:36:48.200]  This is a major factor in the takedown of Nixon.
[02:36:48.200 --> 02:36:52.200]  He threatened the bureaucracy like never before.
[02:36:52.200 --> 02:36:59.200]  He didn't feel he had the mandate to do it in the first term where he had been very narrowly elected with less than 50% of the vote.
[02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:03.200]  After the great sweep of 72, he was ready to make his move.
[02:37:03.200 --> 02:37:14.200]  I know I went to the Office of Economic Opportunity to help close down the legal services operation, which had really become a lobbying operation against Nixon.
[02:37:14.200 --> 02:37:15.200]  We're almost out of time.
[02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:16.200]  And you're riding shotgun.
[02:37:16.200 --> 02:37:19.200]  We'll have Dr. Pachennick back obviously very, very soon if he wants to join us.
[02:37:19.200 --> 02:37:20.200]  See Pachennick.com.
[02:37:20.200 --> 02:37:22.200]  We've been asking a lot of the questions here.
[02:37:22.200 --> 02:37:24.200]  What's the big takeaway from this?
[02:37:24.200 --> 02:37:27.200]  What's the next threat, Dr. Pachennick, and any other points?
[02:37:27.200 --> 02:37:30.200]  The next threat is really what do we do next?
[02:37:30.200 --> 02:37:45.200]  That's what Roger said. Roger and I should go back into the administration and do what we've done in past administrations, which is to sit down, figure out who needs what, who's got to do what, what institutions have to be taken down or downsized.
[02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:47.200]  And it has to be systematic.
[02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:49.200]  It's very much the Trump system.
[02:37:49.200 --> 02:37:50.200]  He has to evaluate.
[02:37:50.200 --> 02:37:51.200]  He has to decide.
[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:53.200]  And then he has to implement.
[02:37:53.200 --> 02:37:54.200]  It's like building and building.
[02:37:54.200 --> 02:38:02.200]  You have to know what you really need, who you really need, and who can implement it, and it has to be done very quickly so that there's no backlash.
[02:38:02.200 --> 02:38:08.200]  Victory is not declared until you really have a republic that's functioning along the line.
[02:38:08.200 --> 02:38:09.200]  That's right.
[02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:10.200]  Until it happens, there's just fantasy.
[02:38:10.200 --> 02:38:12.200]  So here's my question.
[02:38:12.200 --> 02:38:16.200]  Look, if I'm the Clintons or I'm Obama, these are nasty, entitled, delusional people.
[02:38:16.200 --> 02:38:19.200]  It's what makes them so dangerous is they're lazy.
[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:20.200]  They vacation constantly now.
[02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:23.200]  Hillary didn't used to be, but the point is they're bad news.
[02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:24.200]  They're pissed.
[02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:25.200]  They are steaming mad.
[02:38:25.200 --> 02:38:26.200]  Soros is running around.
[02:38:26.200 --> 02:38:29.200]  He's emboldened by all the crimes he's committed, getting away with them.
[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:40.200]  I mean, how does the, the, the bleeding and wounded gremlin of the New World Order neocons globalist, how do they strike back at Trump?
[02:38:40.200 --> 02:38:45.200]  I mean, this is like the March on, on, on the Soviet Union.
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:48.200]  When, when I helped take it down, there was no rebound.
[02:38:48.200 --> 02:38:54.200]  The rebound came 20, 30 years later under Putin, but we wanted a strong leader.
[02:38:54.200 --> 02:38:59.200]  What we have to worry about is not the rebound that's going to come back from these wounded individuals.
[02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:00.200]  They've been humiliated.
[02:39:00.200 --> 02:39:02.200]  It's not just that they've been knocked out.
[02:39:02.200 --> 02:39:04.200]  They've been totally humiliated.
[02:39:04.200 --> 02:39:10.200]  And as Roger points out, there's really a criminal, strong criminal element to it, which Giuliani can handle.
[02:39:10.200 --> 02:39:18.200]  The real issue now is to look upwards. Who is Trump going to appoint? What are the, who are the people that are going to do the cleaning?
[02:39:18.200 --> 02:39:20.200]  Who are the people who are going to run the republic?
[02:39:20.200 --> 02:39:27.200]  And how, how much more are we going to decrease the entire bureaucracy so that it functions in effective way?
[02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:29.200]  That's the key element for us right now.
[02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:33.200]  They can come back any way they want, but they're scattered.
[02:39:33.200 --> 02:39:34.200]  They're fearful.
[02:39:34.200 --> 02:39:35.200]  They're bleeding.
[02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:45.200]  You don't glow at this point. What you do is reconcilate, you reconstitute and then move on and then move on to the system and start to take it apart.
[02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:50.200]  But I mean, isn't it more dangerous to leave the Clintons with all their blackmail data and everything in place?
[02:39:50.200 --> 02:39:53.200]  I'll leave it up to Giuliani. He was a great prosecutor.
[02:39:53.200 --> 02:39:56.200]  You found a Reagan, I used to say the Drexel Burnham.
[02:39:56.200 --> 02:40:04.200]  You have Mike Milken for 600 million on the cover of Time magazine, but I got a young man who's making 50,000 named Giuliani and then Drexel.
[02:40:04.200 --> 02:40:08.200]  The head of Drexel said to me, oh, no, we've got great lawyers.
[02:40:08.200 --> 02:40:10.200]  I said, you're not going to be around.
[02:40:10.200 --> 02:40:16.200]  And I said this $60,000 lawyer, Giuliani is going to take down your $600 million Milken.
[02:40:16.200 --> 02:40:17.200]  And he did it.
[02:40:17.200 --> 02:40:18.200]  I'm not worried about that.
[02:40:18.200 --> 02:40:24.200]  The criminal prosecution will go along the lines of what Giuliani needs to do and Trump wants to do.
[02:40:24.200 --> 02:40:28.200]  What really has to be done, 90% of this is not about vindictiveness.
[02:40:28.200 --> 02:40:34.200]  Roger knows that. I know that even Nixon wasn't as vindictive as people claim.
[02:40:34.200 --> 02:40:36.200]  He instead implemented the foreign policy.
[02:40:36.200 --> 02:40:37.200]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:43.200]  I'm not going to leave a bunch of traders that have sold us out seven ways to Sunday that are my personal enemy in place.
[02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:44.200]  I can't sleep at night.
[02:40:44.200 --> 02:40:48.200]  I would be a moron and Trump would be an idiot if we don't go for the jugular.
[02:40:48.200 --> 02:40:50.200]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's not a question.
[02:40:50.200 --> 02:41:00.200]  What I'm saying is you put them in prison, you put in place all the necessary legal consequences of their behavior.
[02:41:00.200 --> 02:41:03.200]  That's not the key issue now is to move on.
[02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:06.200]  No, I agree. Throw their ass in prison when they get a jury trial and move on.
[02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:07.200]  We'll talk soon.
[02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:09.200]  Well, I think this should be, you know, it up to Giuliani.
[02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:10.200]  He knows prosecution.
[02:41:10.200 --> 02:41:12.200]  He understands what it means to prosecute.
[02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:14.200]  He knows what it will do.
[02:41:14.200 --> 02:41:15.200]  I'll say this. How about issues with Giuliani?
[02:41:15.200 --> 02:41:16.200]  But he has called her a crook.
[02:41:16.200 --> 02:41:17.200]  He has said she has to be...
[02:41:17.200 --> 02:41:21.200]  I'm not worried about it because he has already stated publicly what he would do.
[02:41:21.200 --> 02:41:24.200]  Trump has stated publicly what he is going to do.
[02:41:24.200 --> 02:41:32.200]  What we need to do is to maintain, to make sure that the Department of Defense has a salient capability to do what it needs to do.
[02:41:32.200 --> 02:41:35.200]  That our intelligence community is effective.
[02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:38.200]  Do we really need 16 units in the intelligence unit?
[02:41:38.200 --> 02:41:39.200]  I don't think so.
[02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:40.200]  I think we're out of time.
[02:41:40.200 --> 02:41:41.200]  Dr. Pachennick, we're out of time.
[02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:42.200]  C-Pachennick.com.
[02:41:42.200 --> 02:41:43.200]  Thank you so much.
[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:44.200]  Thank you.
[02:41:44.200 --> 02:41:45.200]  History has happened.
[02:41:45.200 --> 02:41:51.200]  Now, Stone is going to get some lunch and then he's going to be back with us co-hosting.
[02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:53.200]  We've decided to not do 52 hours.
[02:41:53.200 --> 02:41:56.200]  We've decided to just go right through as late as the crew wants to.
[02:41:56.200 --> 02:41:59.200]  And let me tell you, they're all getting bonuses.
[02:41:59.200 --> 02:42:09.200]  Talk about MVPs, the American people taking action, speaking out Hispanic Trump supporters who have been demonized and attacked black Trump supporters.
[02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:11.200]  People have gone through hell.
[02:42:11.200 --> 02:42:13.200]  And I'll tell you what has happened now.
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:17.200]  I always just hire whoever does the best job.
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:22.200]  And I found, of every color, there's great people.
[02:42:22.200 --> 02:42:28.200]  But I say, when liberal media comes here, they go, half people here aren't white.
[02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:29.200]  What's going on?
[02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:32.200]  I'm like, yeah, and I know over at NPR, it's all white people.
[02:42:32.200 --> 02:42:33.200]  Right?
[02:42:33.200 --> 02:42:34.200]  I know.
[02:42:34.200 --> 02:42:40.200]  We hire off what somebody's able to do and their credentials and then how they operate.
[02:42:40.200 --> 02:42:43.200]  I don't look at what color their skin is.
[02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:45.200]  That's why it's being called racist.
[02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:47.200]  It's not that they're guilting me and have power over me.
[02:42:47.200 --> 02:42:52.200]  It pisses me off because I'm not racist.
[02:42:52.200 --> 02:42:55.200]  Now, are there stereotypes of groups and people?
[02:42:55.200 --> 02:42:56.200]  Yeah.
[02:42:56.200 --> 02:43:01.200]  If you're in a Dairy Queen in East Texas and you're with a good looking woman and guys brolin' with a rebel flag.
[02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:05.200]  One of them is probably, you know, and the rebel flag's not a bad flag, but a bunch of guys acting tough.
[02:43:05.200 --> 02:43:07.200]  They might smart off to you because they're about thugs.
[02:43:07.200 --> 02:43:08.200]  They're white guys.
[02:43:08.200 --> 02:43:10.200]  They're thugs. They're gang members.
[02:43:10.200 --> 02:43:14.200]  Don't your black guys pull up all acting thugged out with some music?
[02:43:14.200 --> 02:43:15.200]  You're the hot girl?
[02:43:15.200 --> 02:43:16.200]  They're going to say something.
[02:43:16.200 --> 02:43:18.200]  Are those black thugs or are they white thugs?
[02:43:18.200 --> 02:43:19.200]  They're just thugs, folks.
[02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:21.200]  You see a thug a mile away.
[02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:24.200]  And that's, I'm like Martin Luther King.
[02:43:24.200 --> 02:43:28.200]  When I say that, I don't mean I'm like him being this big hero who got killed and all the rest of it.
[02:43:28.200 --> 02:43:30.200]  I mean, I go off what you do.
[02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:37.200]  I mean, if you've got a restaurant and black people on it, and it's got the best, you know, southern cooking in town.
[02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:39.200]  Which is, is in East Austin.
[02:43:39.200 --> 02:43:40.200]  I'm in there.
[02:43:40.200 --> 02:43:42.200]  I care less what color they are.
[02:43:42.200 --> 02:43:47.200]  Hell, I've even gone on restaurants I know are owned by racist black people because they got the best damn barbecue.
[02:43:47.200 --> 02:43:52.200]  I mean, you know, I'm here, I'm here for the music.
[02:43:52.200 --> 02:43:53.200]  I'm here for the food.
[02:43:53.200 --> 02:43:54.200]  I'm here for the camaraderie.
[02:43:54.200 --> 02:43:58.200]  I'm here to hang a go fishing with somebody no matter what color they are, if they're cool.
[02:43:58.200 --> 02:44:05.200]  And this whole leftist thing is about making us all hate each other instead of being based on basic ideas.
[02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:10.200]  As they rob our entire birthright and everything we are.
[02:44:10.200 --> 02:44:13.200]  And that's what makes me so mad.
[02:44:13.200 --> 02:44:15.200]  You know, how they try to make everybody uncomfortable.
[02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:18.200]  How they try to make people not get along with each other.
[02:44:18.200 --> 02:44:19.200]  They're the race baiters.
[02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:20.200]  They're not even racist.
[02:44:20.200 --> 02:44:22.200]  They're just scientifically using this to control us.
[02:44:22.200 --> 02:44:24.200]  And it pisses me off.
[02:44:24.200 --> 02:44:29.200]  Listen, the future of this country is Hispanics.
[02:44:29.200 --> 02:44:35.200]  Half the kids in what, I think it's ninth grade and below now are Hispanic in this country.
[02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:39.200]  In 10 years it'll be 75%.
[02:44:39.200 --> 02:44:40.200]  I don't, that's fine with me.
[02:44:40.200 --> 02:44:43.200]  White people killed all their kids, as I said earlier.
[02:44:43.200 --> 02:44:52.200]  I just want the Hispanics to adopt the Second Amendment, private property, wealth and success and freedom.
[02:44:52.200 --> 02:45:01.200]  And not be spoon fed by a bunch of weird, evil, hunchback pieces of crap in New York and DC that think you're idiots.
[02:45:01.200 --> 02:45:05.200]  I mean, it pisses me off when people I know do a Nigerian scam.
[02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:07.200]  They think they're really getting money from somebody.
[02:45:07.200 --> 02:45:10.200]  And I tell them, that's a Nigerian scam.
[02:45:10.200 --> 02:45:11.200]  And they go, no, you're just jealous.
[02:45:11.200 --> 02:45:13.200]  I know Prince Boo Boo.
[02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:14.200]  And it's the same thing.
[02:45:14.200 --> 02:45:17.200]  No, you're going to give more money and then you're going to get ripped off.
[02:45:17.200 --> 02:45:20.200]  They don't want to believe they're being conned.
[02:45:20.200 --> 02:45:24.200]  And the folks I know that have done, you know, been ripped off by Nigerian scams are white people.
[02:45:24.200 --> 02:45:29.200]  The point is, I told the story that I'm going to our guest.
[02:45:29.200 --> 02:45:35.200]  I'll hold it in the next hour of need because I don't want to cut Larry Nichols' story because he's been so central part of this.
[02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:38.200]  And we got Roger Stone coming back in after each Texas barbecue.
[02:45:38.200 --> 02:45:49.200]  But what I'm getting at here is, these are people who are black, white, Hispanic, German, Jewish, Chinese, Japanese, you know, Nigerian.
[02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:55.200]  Who are just bad people?
[02:45:55.200 --> 02:45:57.200]  They'll say I'm bashing Nigerians.
[02:45:57.200 --> 02:45:58.200]  No, that's just a well-known scam.
[02:45:58.200 --> 02:45:59.200]  It's an example.
[02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:00.200]  I've told the story.
[02:46:00.200 --> 02:46:03.200]  I'm out listening to Rockabilly music with Mike Judge.
[02:46:03.200 --> 02:46:04.200]  Not name dropping.
[02:46:04.200 --> 02:46:05.200]  That's who I was out with.
[02:46:05.200 --> 02:46:07.200]  And everybody goes, oh my God, the princes are here.
[02:46:07.200 --> 02:46:09.200]  And then these guys pull up this whole Cadillac.
[02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:12.200]  And it's this Rockabilly place where all the trainees go to.
[02:46:12.200 --> 02:46:13.200]  Former black bar.
[02:46:13.200 --> 02:46:14.200]  It's still about half black.
[02:46:14.200 --> 02:46:15.200]  We're out there about 2 a.m.
[02:46:15.200 --> 02:46:17.200]  This is years ago.
[02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:19.200]  And listen to this music.
[02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:23.200]  And these guys walk in on these outfits and everybody's kissing their ass, giving them free drinks and everything.
[02:46:23.200 --> 02:46:25.200]  And they're like, that's royalty.
[02:46:25.200 --> 02:46:26.200]  And I said, no, that's not.
[02:46:26.200 --> 02:46:27.200]  That's a freaking scam.
[02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:33.200]  And I had to go over and say to them, I said, God, you guys go around all day like you're royalty.
[02:46:33.200 --> 02:46:36.200]  And I said, that's basically what government does or Queen Elizabeth does.
[02:46:36.200 --> 02:46:37.200]  Kim Jong-un is royalty.
[02:46:37.200 --> 02:46:39.200]  He's third generation dictator.
[02:46:39.200 --> 02:46:40.200]  It's all as disgusting.
[02:46:40.200 --> 02:46:43.200]  And that's why I don't like people to put on fronts.
[02:46:43.200 --> 02:46:46.200]  And I'm here to tell you, the Democratic Party is a Nigerian scam.
[02:46:46.200 --> 02:46:48.200]  I mean, the whole, I don't mean literally Nigerian scam.
[02:46:48.200 --> 02:46:51.200]  It's all a big joke.
[02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:54.200]  And it's time for it to come down.
[02:46:54.200 --> 02:46:55.200]  It's time for it to fail.
[02:46:55.200 --> 02:46:57.200]  It's time for it to fall apart.
[02:46:57.200 --> 02:47:08.200]  And it's time for all of us to deliver on prosecuting the Clintons, deliver on tax cuts, deliver on spending cuts, deliver on detain.
[02:47:08.200 --> 02:47:09.200]  This is beautiful.
[02:47:09.200 --> 02:47:11.200]  Trump means no forced inoculations.
[02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:13.200]  Trump means cities pulling flour out of the water.
[02:47:13.200 --> 02:47:14.200]  Oh yeah, he's on board.
[02:47:14.200 --> 02:47:23.200]  Trump means we've got somebody who they're going to try to block, but he's going to try with his bully pulpit to deliver everything we want that's constitutional.
[02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:25.200]  That's a big deal.
[02:47:25.200 --> 02:47:26.200]  Don't want war with Russia.
[02:47:26.200 --> 02:47:27.200]  Don't want to fund jihadis.
[02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:34.200]  Don't want to bring in unvetted people with syphilis or TB or fricking cholera or leprosy.
[02:47:34.200 --> 02:47:36.200]  You want Trump.
[02:47:36.200 --> 02:47:39.200]  Trump doesn't want to blow our brains out.
[02:47:39.200 --> 02:47:44.200]  Trump isn't at satanic meetings with weirdo women drinking blood.
[02:47:44.200 --> 02:47:46.200]  I mean, I'm with the guy that doesn't drink blood.
[02:47:46.200 --> 02:47:47.200]  You know what I mean?
[02:47:47.200 --> 02:47:51.200]  He's not perfect, but he has the courage to take action.
[02:47:51.200 --> 02:47:52.200]  We're going to Larry Nichols.
[02:47:52.200 --> 02:47:54.200]  I'm going to skip this break before I go any further.
[02:47:54.200 --> 02:47:57.200]  I don't tell you about people that make this broadcast spot possible.
[02:47:57.200 --> 02:48:00.200]  And that's the products at infowarstore.com.
[02:48:00.200 --> 02:48:04.200]  We're running a special that is unprecedented for this election.
[02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:05.200]  And now this victory.

[02:48:54.200 --> 02:48:57.200]  Now, don't forget we have third party sponsors that are great folks.
[02:48:57.200 --> 02:49:00.200]  Solutions from Science is one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:49:00.200 --> 02:49:03.200]  And they are selling some of their perfect power soldiers and generators below cost.
[02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:06.200]  This is their top of the line model, the one I use at my house.
[02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:08.200]  It's expandable, so you can make it as powerful as you want to.
[02:49:08.200 --> 02:49:12.200]  Normally around 6,000, they're letting them go for less than 1,500.
[02:49:12.200 --> 02:49:14.200]  I paid 4,000 years ago and I got the discount.
[02:49:14.200 --> 02:49:15.200]  It's a big deal.
[02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:17.200]  Visit powergridchaos.com.

[02:49:20.200 --> 02:49:22.200]  Continuing.
[02:49:22.200 --> 02:49:24.200]  Revelations.
[02:49:24.200 --> 02:49:25.200]  I'm in the movie.
[02:49:25.200 --> 02:49:26.200]  Bunch of other great folks.
[02:49:26.200 --> 02:49:27.200]  It exposes everything.
[02:49:27.200 --> 02:49:28.200]  The war goes on.
[02:49:28.200 --> 02:49:29.200]  The fight goes on.
[02:49:29.200 --> 02:49:30.200]  Charlie Daniels.
[02:49:30.200 --> 02:49:31.200]  It's powerful.
[02:49:31.200 --> 02:49:35.200]  Chuck Undersea and Army Colonel, great patriot, has spent his life's fortune.
[02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:37.200]  His wife's savings to put this out.
[02:49:37.200 --> 02:49:39.200]  Five years of the making.
[02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:41.200]  This is a powerful film.
[02:49:41.200 --> 02:49:42.200]  It needs to be seen.
[02:49:42.200 --> 02:49:43.200]  Schedule showings in your area.
[02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:44.200]  Get the DVD.
[02:49:44.200 --> 02:49:45.200]  You name it.
[02:49:45.200 --> 02:49:51.200]  infowars.com obviously is behind this because there's such great patriots.
[02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:57.200]  Visit revelationthemovie.info, revelationthemovie.info to purchase your DVD or check into hosting
[02:49:57.200 --> 02:49:59.200]  at the theater near you.
[02:49:59.200 --> 02:50:01.200]  That's revelationthemovie.info.
[02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:02.200]  All right.
[02:50:02.200 --> 02:50:03.200]  We're going to continue.
[02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:05.200]  Not 50 hours now, but 60 hours.
[02:50:05.200 --> 02:50:06.200]  We're just continuing.
[02:50:06.200 --> 02:50:08.200]  I don't care if it's just one person.
[02:50:08.200 --> 02:50:09.200]  Whoever wants to stay can.
[02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:11.200]  They're getting hazard pay right now.
[02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:13.200]  We're going to continue on today.
[02:50:13.200 --> 02:50:15.200]  Continue on because people are tuned in.
[02:50:15.200 --> 02:50:16.200]  They want to know what's going on.
[02:50:16.200 --> 02:50:17.200]  They're excited.
[02:50:17.200 --> 02:50:19.200]  History's happening.
[02:50:19.200 --> 02:50:25.200]  But again, I am so thankful right now because this is a repudiation of all the fake polling
[02:50:25.200 --> 02:50:26.200]  companies.
[02:50:26.200 --> 02:50:30.200]  This is a repudiation of the mainstream media.
[02:50:30.200 --> 02:50:31.200]  Big liberal.
[02:50:31.200 --> 02:50:33.200]  They try to steal it from Trump last night.
[02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:35.200]  The tsunami win was so big they failed.
[02:50:35.200 --> 02:50:38.200]  The tsunami win was so big they failed.
[02:50:38.200 --> 02:50:40.200]  But they're going to strike back.
[02:50:40.200 --> 02:50:44.200]  Larry Nichols, we have seen the fall of the Clintons at least so far.
[02:50:44.200 --> 02:50:47.200]  Let's talk about how they may counter strike.
[02:50:47.200 --> 02:50:49.200]  You predicted that they would no bill them.
[02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:52.200]  You predicted they would come out the day before the election or two days before and
[02:50:52.200 --> 02:50:54.200]  say that they'd done nothing wrong.
[02:50:54.200 --> 02:50:56.200]  But despite all that, they failed.
[02:50:56.200 --> 02:51:00.200]  I think it's very telling that former Clinton confidant, former Clinton insider, I think
[02:51:00.200 --> 02:51:09.200]  it's very telling Larry Nichols that they would not concede that night in a press conference
[02:51:09.200 --> 02:51:13.200]  that you're probably too sick to, that they did it the next day and that they weren't as
[02:51:13.200 --> 02:51:15.200]  conciliatory as Trump.
[02:51:15.200 --> 02:51:20.200]  Do you talk about that A and then B, whoever's on your plate, do you agree with me that they're
[02:51:20.200 --> 02:51:21.200]  insane?
[02:51:21.200 --> 02:51:26.200]  Trump is, well, he's not, and his entire crew, they are leaving a rattlesnake in their bed
[02:51:26.200 --> 02:51:32.200]  if they do not route the Clintons and their entire crime syndicate, including the Neocons,
[02:51:32.200 --> 02:51:33.200]  immediately.
[02:51:33.200 --> 02:51:41.200]  You know, Alex, if Donald Trump doesn't go all the way, he's a fool.
[02:51:41.200 --> 02:51:43.200]  He's an absolute fool.
[02:51:43.200 --> 02:51:48.200]  Look, these people, like the plague, you may get a case solved.
[02:51:48.200 --> 02:51:52.200]  But unless you kill the plague, it's not going to go away.
[02:51:52.200 --> 02:51:55.200]  It's not going to go away.
[02:51:55.200 --> 02:52:01.200]  What they're working on, I will bet you $100 to biscuit what they did last night that delayed
[02:52:01.200 --> 02:52:04.200]  their announcement or concession.
[02:52:04.200 --> 02:52:10.200]  And she was checking with Obama, checking to make sure that everything was in place since
[02:52:10.200 --> 02:52:16.700]  they were having to face defeat, making sure that he had her covered with the pardon, making
[02:52:16.700 --> 02:52:21.500]  sure that the Clinton Foundation was covered with the pardon.
[02:52:21.500 --> 02:52:24.440]  And then they're making their plans today.
[02:52:24.440 --> 02:52:27.000]  They're not making their plans to ride off.
[02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:31.080]  They're not planning to go away and disappear.
[02:52:31.080 --> 02:52:37.520]  You got to remember they made large promises, large promises to people that have put billions
[02:52:37.520 --> 02:52:42.400]  of dollars into that foundation.
[02:52:42.400 --> 02:52:45.000]  They can't walk away from that.
[02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.240]  So no, it's not over.
[02:52:47.240 --> 02:52:55.280]  Now, what Donald Trump's got to do, and I wish everybody in this audience would do it,
[02:52:55.280 --> 02:53:01.640]  send him a letter, send Donald Trump a letter and remind him of all the things that he promised
[02:53:01.640 --> 02:53:04.000]  us he would do if he became president.
[02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:06.760]  I'm talking about build the wall.
[02:53:06.760 --> 02:53:14.760]  I'm talking about stopping this madness of these unvetted Syrians coming in by the thousands.
[02:53:14.760 --> 02:53:16.840]  He's got to hold to that promise.
[02:53:16.840 --> 02:53:22.200]  You know, he's he's been elected, but there's a couple of things I've seen that I don't
[02:53:22.200 --> 02:53:23.200]  like that.
[02:53:23.200 --> 02:53:29.040]  I like number one, Paul Ryan, you know, him and Paul Ryan making up him and Hillary making
[02:53:29.040 --> 02:53:30.040]  up all this.
[02:53:30.040 --> 02:53:31.040]  Oh, no, I agree.
[02:53:31.040 --> 02:53:32.760]  Paul Ryan is stabbed in the back three times.
[02:53:32.760 --> 02:53:33.760]  Right.
[02:53:33.760 --> 02:53:34.760]  No, let me tell you.
[02:53:34.760 --> 02:53:35.760]  Trump's smart.
[02:53:35.760 --> 02:53:36.760]  He needs to get in.
[02:53:36.760 --> 02:53:37.760]  I'm not going to give him.
[02:53:37.760 --> 02:53:40.680]  He's going to get in and they already know it.
[02:53:40.680 --> 02:53:43.080]  So how will they attack him in the next two and a half months, though?
[02:53:43.080 --> 02:53:45.680]  I mean, they are they're not going to go away quietly.
[02:53:45.680 --> 02:53:52.200]  They've got that Donald Trump is going to run into a Congress that is going to everything
[02:53:52.200 --> 02:53:56.640]  he tries to do, they're going to shut him down and he has to go on TV and name the people
[02:53:56.640 --> 02:53:57.640]  that are involved.
[02:53:57.640 --> 02:53:58.640]  Yes.
[02:53:58.640 --> 02:54:00.760]  That's why he has to remove Paul Ryan.
[02:54:00.760 --> 02:54:06.680]  Paul Ryan's head politically should be on a frickin spike in front of the White House.
[02:54:06.680 --> 02:54:15.120]  And Paul Ryan has already said that if Donald Trump tries to build that wall, he has a lawsuit
[02:54:15.120 --> 02:54:19.200]  waiting or he got it prepared, a lawsuit to stop him.
[02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:20.200]  And then.
[02:54:20.200 --> 02:54:22.200]  Oh, big, frickin deal.
[02:54:22.200 --> 02:54:23.200]  Exactly.
[02:54:23.200 --> 02:54:24.680]  And we're allowed to have a damn wall.
[02:54:24.680 --> 02:54:25.680]  Right.
[02:54:25.680 --> 02:54:30.720]  And then Donald Trump saying that he's going to get rid of all these presidential special
[02:54:30.720 --> 02:54:31.720]  orders.
[02:54:31.720 --> 02:54:33.640]  He's going to do special orders to get rid of them.
[02:54:33.640 --> 02:54:35.520]  Let me tell you the problem.
[02:54:35.520 --> 02:54:40.960]  You know, this Alex, when Obama issued everyone of those presidential special orders, Congress
[02:54:40.960 --> 02:54:44.200]  had 30 days to rescind every damn one of them.
[02:54:44.200 --> 02:54:45.200]  And they didn't.
[02:54:45.200 --> 02:54:47.840]  And they set up funding bureaucracies for each one of the little things.
[02:54:47.840 --> 02:54:48.840]  That's right.
[02:54:48.840 --> 02:54:52.000]  They could have shut everyone of them down, but I'll bet you this.
[02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:56.560]  When Donald Trump signs presidential special order, what do you bet there's a recension
[02:54:56.560 --> 02:54:58.360]  order signed immediately?
[02:54:58.360 --> 02:55:04.960]  No, he's going to fight a Congress that is going to be vicious unless he stands up
[02:55:04.960 --> 02:55:08.560]  as he has done and tell the American people.
[02:55:08.560 --> 02:55:09.560]  That's right.
[02:55:09.560 --> 02:55:13.480]  If he is conciliatory, if he plays bold, as you notice, Obama came out today and said,
[02:55:13.480 --> 02:55:15.800]  all right, we should all root for Trump as a quote.
[02:55:15.800 --> 02:55:17.280]  We should get behind him.
[02:55:17.280 --> 02:55:19.840]  They're openly now saying, OK, you beat us.
[02:55:19.840 --> 02:55:20.840]  You took over.
[02:55:20.840 --> 02:55:21.840]  We'll leave you alone.
[02:55:21.840 --> 02:55:22.840]  If you sell out.
[02:55:22.840 --> 02:55:23.840]  No.
[02:55:23.840 --> 02:55:28.080]  Now we're going to find out is Trump did Trump really just want to take over the kingdom
[02:55:28.080 --> 02:55:29.880]  or do you want to change the world?
[02:55:29.880 --> 02:55:30.880]  This is where we.
[02:55:30.880 --> 02:55:31.880]  And I think he's for real.
[02:55:31.880 --> 02:55:32.880]  We're about to find out.
[02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:37.000]  I think he's for real, but we've got to make him prove it.
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:38.000]  He's got to prove it.
[02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:44.640]  He can't just say it, you know, Alex, listen, you've never seen a time when a moral Christian
[02:55:44.640 --> 02:55:49.520]  conservative and a liberal or a communist had negotiated.
[02:55:49.520 --> 02:55:54.400]  You've never seen it whenever negotiations take place, but don't shorten it by saying
[02:55:54.400 --> 02:55:59.240]  a liberal and a conservative is one sided, one sided every time.
[02:55:59.240 --> 02:56:05.320]  So Trump's got to bring to that White House his business acumen.
[02:56:05.320 --> 02:56:08.160]  He knows what it's like to get into a deal.
[02:56:08.160 --> 02:56:14.040]  He knows what it's like to negotiate and I'll hold him to what he has said.
[02:56:14.040 --> 02:56:21.200]  He knows how to win in negotiations and he damn well better do it or this whole ride
[02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:22.480]  will be short lived.
[02:56:22.480 --> 02:56:28.600]  Alex, it will be the shortest lived trip we've ever seen because they will cut him up in
[02:56:28.600 --> 02:56:29.600]  a million pieces.
[02:56:29.600 --> 02:56:30.600]  That's right.
[02:56:30.600 --> 02:56:31.600]  Let's stop right there.
[02:56:31.600 --> 02:56:36.000]  Talk about this though, celebration wise, the mainstream media is dead.
[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:37.000]  They've destroyed themselves.
[02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:38.000]  They're a joke.
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:41.400]  They'll still prop it up because it's an even bigger collapse if they admit it's gone because
[02:56:41.400 --> 02:56:43.280]  then it'll just be, oh, we're actually the real media.
[02:56:43.280 --> 02:56:44.280]  Oh my God, these people were fake.
[02:56:44.280 --> 02:56:46.480]  It's all in the WikiLeaks.
[02:56:46.480 --> 02:56:51.240]  But this is a repudiation of the pollsters, the political class, the elites.
[02:56:51.240 --> 02:56:59.480]  This vote, this overriding of the fraud is a indicator, a major blue ribbon victory gauging
[02:56:59.480 --> 02:57:00.480]  the level of awakening.
[02:57:00.480 --> 02:57:04.880]  I mean, is it not spectacular Trump aside?
[02:57:04.880 --> 02:57:13.240]  You know, Alex, this is the greatest day for programs networks like yours.
[02:57:13.240 --> 02:57:21.160]  You proved through this network, through Matt Drudge and his internet site, you proved
[02:57:21.160 --> 02:57:23.440]  that the truth is out there.
[02:57:23.440 --> 02:57:26.720]  Somebody's got the courage to cover it.
[02:57:26.720 --> 02:57:32.880]  And I believe that the mainstream media now has humiliated itself.
[02:57:32.880 --> 02:57:36.480]  I don't know who they're going to go to to convince anymore.
[02:57:36.480 --> 02:57:38.360]  Who's going to believe them anymore?
[02:57:38.360 --> 02:57:40.520]  Who's going to believe the polls?
[02:57:40.520 --> 02:57:41.520]  That's right.
[02:57:41.520 --> 02:57:42.520]  That's right.
[02:57:42.520 --> 02:57:46.040]  They were already totally discredited at 6% in major studies, AP.
[02:57:46.040 --> 02:57:48.720]  Now they acted like we were crazy that Trump would win.
[02:57:48.720 --> 02:57:50.440]  They are in negative numbers.
[02:57:50.440 --> 02:57:55.880]  They are the discredited joke of the world.
[02:57:55.880 --> 02:58:02.560]  The only way they come back is to lie and to try to put on this facade that they're changing,
[02:58:02.560 --> 02:58:07.640]  that they're changing, and they're going to be more conservative, more fair, that they're
[02:58:07.640 --> 02:58:10.840]  going to deal with the news straight up.
[02:58:10.840 --> 02:58:14.680]  But everything I've seen this thus far this morning doesn't show me that.
[02:58:14.680 --> 02:58:15.680]  Hey, let me tell you.
[02:58:15.680 --> 02:58:16.680]  Here's an analogy.
[02:58:16.680 --> 02:58:19.760]  We're going to come back, 70 seconds from Larry Nichols.
[02:58:19.760 --> 02:58:24.200]  If I get food poisoning in a restaurant that I've been to for years that I love, I'm never
[02:58:24.200 --> 02:58:26.280]  going back there again.
[02:58:26.280 --> 02:58:29.160]  Everything they serve, we get food poisoning from.
[02:58:29.160 --> 02:58:31.960]  So I don't care what they say or what they do.
[02:58:31.960 --> 02:58:37.520]  CNN, Megyn Kelly, all of them, you're done, you're done.
[02:58:37.520 --> 02:58:48.600]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:48.600 --> 02:58:52.480]  Despite all the status rhetoric that gun control works, here's five reasons why it won't.
[02:58:52.480 --> 02:58:56.280]  Number one, California has many of the most restrictive gun laws in the country, yet those
[02:58:56.280 --> 02:58:59.920]  laws did absolutely nothing to stop the San Bernardino shooting.
[02:58:59.920 --> 02:59:03.400]  Number two, Paris, France also has some of the most restrictive gun laws in the world,
[02:59:03.400 --> 02:59:07.160]  but those laws also did nothing to stop the November 13th ISIS attacks.
[02:59:07.160 --> 02:59:11.800]  Number three, it's estimated that someone in Chicago is shot every 2.8 hours despite
[02:59:11.800 --> 02:59:13.800]  the city's strict gun laws.
[02:59:13.800 --> 02:59:19.200]  Number four, Mexico also has restrictive gun laws just like Chicago, yet over 160,000 people
[02:59:19.200 --> 02:59:22.360]  have been murdered in the country's drug war since 2007.
[02:59:22.360 --> 02:59:26.040]  The only people who are actually stopping the Mexican cartels are private citizens who
[02:59:26.040 --> 02:59:30.360]  are openly defying Mexico's gun laws to form self-defense militias.
[02:59:30.360 --> 02:59:34.320]  Number five, President Obama has been arming and funding ISIS-linked Syrian rebels for
[02:59:34.320 --> 02:59:35.320]  quite some time.
[02:59:35.320 --> 02:59:40.080]  In fact, Obama approved the rearming of the so-called moderate rebels on October 1st.
[02:59:40.080 --> 02:59:43.640]  The same day he called for gun control in response to the community college shooting
[02:59:43.640 --> 02:59:44.640]  up in Oregon.
[02:59:44.640 --> 02:59:50.440]  You can find out more at Infowars.com's Kit Daniels reporting.
[02:59:50.440 --> 03:00:02.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:02.800 --> 03:00:04.640]  We are on the march.
[03:00:04.640 --> 03:00:07.640]  The empire is on the run.
[03:00:07.640 --> 03:00:16.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network, Alex Jones here back live, bunch of special reports
[03:00:16.440 --> 03:00:17.440]  coming up.
[03:00:17.440 --> 03:00:23.920]  Donald Trump in the next segment, but I wanted to mention this because it's such, it's so
[03:00:23.920 --> 03:00:24.920]  sea change.
[03:00:24.920 --> 03:00:25.920]  Unacceptable.
[03:00:25.920 --> 03:00:30.200]  Wolf Blitzer rebukes Trump for breaches in press protocol.
[03:00:30.200 --> 03:00:33.880]  He just said how horrible it is that it's unacceptable.
[03:00:33.880 --> 03:00:40.680]  They have to fix it, the White House Correspondence Association deeply concerned that he isn't
[03:00:40.680 --> 03:00:45.720]  telling them everywhere he goes and what he does so they can sycophantically run around
[03:00:45.720 --> 03:00:46.720]  behind him.
[03:00:46.720 --> 03:00:51.800]  This is a bunch of arrogant, nobody's from bad families on average, literally.
[03:00:51.800 --> 03:00:52.800]  I don't know why it is.
[03:00:52.800 --> 03:00:53.800]  He researched these journals.
[03:00:53.800 --> 03:00:58.240]  These have horrible families, horrible people, no success, just the sons and daughters of
[03:00:58.240 --> 03:01:02.880]  con artists, criminals, murderers, filth, trash, garbage, just you name it.
[03:01:02.880 --> 03:01:03.880]  It's just it's true.
[03:01:03.880 --> 03:01:04.880]  They don't build anything.
[03:01:04.880 --> 03:01:07.200]  There's a parasite around, but kiss around.
[03:01:07.200 --> 03:01:11.560]  They're just saying how dare you ignore us in DC and then fly off back to New York.
[03:01:11.560 --> 03:01:13.480]  Wonderful, wonderful.
[03:01:13.480 --> 03:01:15.680]  That's how you help collapse them.
[03:01:15.680 --> 03:01:19.600]  Only Trump's glow, giving them energy, can keep these vampires alive.
[03:01:19.600 --> 03:01:24.120]  They're like how dare you not let us suck your blood.
[03:01:24.120 --> 03:01:25.120]  He doesn't need them.
[03:01:25.120 --> 03:01:26.720]  They're not going to turn to his side.
[03:01:26.720 --> 03:01:28.160]  So this is a really juicy thing.
[03:01:28.160 --> 03:01:29.160]  Here it is.
[03:01:29.160 --> 03:01:33.480]  I'm going to have to get accustomed to some norms that are in place here in Washington.
[03:01:33.480 --> 03:01:39.440]  Donald Trump, we're told by an aide left Washington earlier this afternoon, got on his plane,
[03:01:39.440 --> 03:01:45.640]  returned to New York City without any reporters being told that the president-elect was leaving
[03:01:45.640 --> 03:01:46.640]  Washington.
[03:01:46.640 --> 03:01:51.400]  He arrived at LaGuardia earlier this evening and then presumably went back to Trump Tower.
[03:01:51.400 --> 03:01:55.840]  Wolf, as you know, that is sort of outside the norms of what we expect when we cover
[03:01:55.840 --> 03:02:01.920]  a president-elect, it is expected that a pool of reporters is kept abreast of his movements
[03:02:01.920 --> 03:02:02.920]  at all times.
[03:02:02.920 --> 03:02:03.920]  That's enough.
[03:02:03.920 --> 03:02:04.920]  Then Wolf Blitzer flips out.
[03:02:04.920 --> 03:02:07.080]  I love how he's in a tower.
[03:02:07.080 --> 03:02:08.280]  It's like under siege.
[03:02:08.280 --> 03:02:09.680]  He gets it.
[03:02:09.680 --> 03:02:13.720]  Because these are the people that lied, said he could never win, said that he couldn't
[03:02:13.720 --> 03:02:17.800]  have the nomination, then said they could steal it, then said he didn't deserve the
[03:02:17.800 --> 03:02:20.800]  money he raised.
[03:02:20.800 --> 03:02:27.440]  They were wrong about everything on every front and backstabbed time and time and time
[03:02:27.440 --> 03:02:29.200]  and time and time again.
[03:02:29.200 --> 03:02:32.960]  And then now we're just supposed to keep groveling because they've got a big TV station and
[03:02:32.960 --> 03:02:38.840]  guys in trench coats and scarves looking official when they'd sell their mother out for a stick
[03:02:38.840 --> 03:02:39.840]  of bubblegum.
[03:02:39.840 --> 03:02:43.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time and you did it.
[03:02:43.360 --> 03:02:45.800]  I wanted 100 million views over election.
[03:02:45.800 --> 03:02:47.640]  We only had 90 million.
[03:02:47.640 --> 03:02:49.240]  I'll take it.
[03:02:49.240 --> 03:02:54.280]  God bless you, you did an incredible job rubbing it in their faces outside of our terrestrial
[03:02:54.280 --> 03:02:55.280]  radio audience.
[03:02:55.280 --> 03:02:57.160]  It's now 5 million a day conservatively.
[03:02:57.160 --> 03:02:58.960]  That's very conservative.
[03:02:58.960 --> 03:03:01.000]  We can say we're bigger than Rush Limbaugh.
[03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:03.720]  We're now the biggest broadcast transmission there is.
[03:03:03.720 --> 03:03:05.720]  Drudge is the biggest website.
[03:03:05.720 --> 03:03:06.720]  Love it.
[03:03:06.720 --> 03:03:08.280]  It's not about who's the biggest.
[03:03:08.280 --> 03:03:11.800]  The point is that our message of freedom is the most popular and that's why now if you
[03:03:11.800 --> 03:03:16.200]  will actually convert the listenership to supporting us, you'll see this grow just like
[03:03:16.200 --> 03:03:19.960]  we promised you on TV and radio and dominating and taking America back.
[03:03:19.960 --> 03:03:20.960]  We've got the beach head now.
[03:03:20.960 --> 03:03:25.760]  If you'll support us, buy your war bonds, become a president planet on TV member, go

[03:04:12.180 --> 03:04:13.180]  This is the new media.
[03:04:13.180 --> 03:04:17.800]  This is like a new YouTube because we've already got like 15 people on there that can upload
[03:04:17.800 --> 03:04:19.880]  videos and original articles and content.
[03:04:19.880 --> 03:04:23.120]  We're going to start adding people like Nellie Weaver, one of our great reporters.
[03:04:23.120 --> 03:04:28.040]  We're going to add other reporters that we've had here in the past and correspondence and
[03:04:28.040 --> 03:04:31.720]  other people that want to reach out to our audience and then we're going to take the
[03:04:31.720 --> 03:04:35.280]  most powerful reports off that and put them on our Facebook, put them on our YouTube,
[03:04:35.280 --> 03:04:38.640]  put them on this broadcast and just magnify all of that.
[03:04:38.640 --> 03:04:43.000]  I want to get hundreds of correspondence across the country where with an iPhone or a droid
[03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:47.880]  they have the power of a network that can't be censored by Google or Facebook and upload
[03:04:47.880 --> 03:04:53.440]  or stream live to reach the world and it's got community, we're going to add a lot more
[03:04:53.440 --> 03:04:54.440]  to it.
[03:04:54.440 --> 03:04:58.360]  Check it out infowars.com forward slash app.
[03:04:58.360 --> 03:05:02.960]  The Constitutional Convention 1787 was held strict secrecy and at the end of the preceding
[03:05:02.960 --> 03:05:06.840]  citizens gathered outside Independence Hall to learn what had been produced behind closed
[03:05:06.840 --> 03:05:07.840]  doors.
[03:05:07.840 --> 03:05:11.040]  The Constitutional Convention in Franklin was leaving the hall a lady asked him, well doctor,
[03:05:11.040 --> 03:05:12.040]  what have we got?
[03:05:12.040 --> 03:05:13.400]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:05:13.400 --> 03:05:16.400]  To which he responded, a republic if you can keep it.
[03:05:16.400 --> 03:05:20.240]  But today not only have we lost a republic but most people don't even know what a republic
[03:05:20.240 --> 03:05:21.240]  even is.
[03:05:21.240 --> 03:05:24.200]  For one thing a republic is not a democracy.
[03:05:24.200 --> 03:05:27.240]  Republic operates under the rule of law which protects individual liberties so that the
[03:05:27.240 --> 03:05:29.880]  majority cannot take away the rights of the minority.
[03:05:29.880 --> 03:05:33.920]  Under republic the government and its citizens all abide by the same laws regardless of political
[03:05:33.920 --> 03:05:35.840]  power or lack thereof.
[03:05:35.840 --> 03:05:38.920]  Democracy on the other hand only leads to mob rule fueled by the unrestrained whims
[03:05:38.920 --> 03:05:39.920]  of the public.
[03:05:39.920 --> 03:05:43.640]  In a democracy the individual or any groups of individuals composing the minority have
[03:05:43.640 --> 03:05:47.520]  no protection against the unlimited power of the majority, it is a case of majority
[03:05:47.520 --> 03:05:48.520]  over man.
[03:05:48.520 --> 03:05:52.080]  In other words under democracy two wolves can vote to eat the sheep for dinner but under
[03:05:52.080 --> 03:05:55.400]  a republic the sheep's right to life is protected by the rule of law.
[03:05:55.400 --> 03:05:58.200]  This is Kit Daniels with infowars.com.
[03:05:58.200 --> 03:06:04.200]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars biome defense
[03:06:04.200 --> 03:06:05.800]  probiotic.

[03:06:55.440 --> 03:07:01.960]  wars more than two years ago info wars first told you about our research into what has
[03:07:01.960 --> 03:07:06.600]  been called the iodine conspiracy and told you about how scientists have known for decades
[03:07:06.600 --> 03:07:11.560]  that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started
[03:07:11.560 --> 03:07:16.160]  taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family
[03:07:16.160 --> 03:07:17.160]  into the water.
[03:07:17.160 --> 03:07:22.040]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis
[03:07:22.040 --> 03:07:26.800]  worsened as it still is worsening today I was there telling you how to prepare yourself
[03:07:26.800 --> 03:07:27.800]  for your family.
[03:07:27.800 --> 03:07:33.280]  Now in 2016 even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[03:07:33.280 --> 03:07:39.080]  iodine and the gut which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[03:07:39.080 --> 03:07:40.680]  ever concerning iodine.
[03:07:40.680 --> 03:07:42.640]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[03:07:42.640 --> 03:07:47.280]  This is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine is essential in my view to any
[03:07:47.280 --> 03:07:53.240]  optimum health regimen stock up on survival shield x2 today at infowarslife.com or by
[03:07:53.240 --> 03:08:21.440]  calling 888-253-3139.
[03:08:21.440 --> 03:08:27.520]  Donald Trump again joins us and I've got so many questions but first off Donald thank
[03:08:27.520 --> 03:08:28.800]  you for joining us.
[03:08:28.800 --> 03:08:29.800]  Thank you Alex.
[03:08:29.800 --> 03:08:30.800]  Great.
[03:08:30.800 --> 03:08:31.800]  Great to be with you.
[03:08:31.800 --> 03:08:36.440]  I've got so many questions but you are vindicated this has got to be the 50th time the last
[03:08:36.440 --> 03:08:42.200]  six months on the radical Muslim celebrating not just in New Jersey but New York, Palestine
[03:08:42.200 --> 03:08:43.200]  all over.
[03:08:43.200 --> 03:08:47.400]  What do you have to say they're still attacking you though we've got Dan Rather on video we've
[03:08:47.400 --> 03:08:53.160]  got New York Post we've got Washington Post we've got I mean what's going on here.
[03:08:53.160 --> 03:08:57.720]  Well I took a lot of heat and I was very strong on it and I held my line and then all of a
[03:08:57.720 --> 03:09:01.840]  sudden you know hundreds of people were calling up my office I was the other day in Sarasota
[03:09:01.840 --> 03:09:07.300]  Florida and people are online and we had 12,000 people which is fantastic and the people were
[03:09:07.300 --> 03:09:12.200]  saying many other people from New Jersey four or five people said Mr. Trump I saw it myself
[03:09:12.200 --> 03:09:16.400]  I was there they talked about Patterson but they said I saw it myself Mr. Trump I was
[03:09:16.400 --> 03:09:22.560]  there so many people have called in and on Twitter at real Donald Trump they're all tweeting
[03:09:22.560 --> 03:09:28.000]  so I knew it happened and I held my line and people wanted me to apologize and we can't
[03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:30.400]  do that people like you and I can't do that so easily.
[03:09:30.400 --> 03:09:35.200]  Now we can do it if we're wrong Alex you apologize I'd apologize if I was wrong but they were
[03:09:35.200 --> 03:09:40.360]  celebrating and they were celebrating the fall of the World Trade Center I think that's disgraceful.
[03:09:40.360 --> 03:09:45.200]  It is and that same week you were reporting on that fact we had two different international
[03:09:45.200 --> 03:09:50.760]  football games soccer games with the Turkish fans and others during the moment of silence
[03:09:50.760 --> 03:09:57.880]  for the dead people in Paris chanting Allah Akbar and booing so did that not happen too?
[03:09:57.880 --> 03:10:01.600]  Well that happened and everybody saw it that was a week ago and the players were out on
[03:10:01.600 --> 03:10:04.040]  the field and they couldn't believe it they were embarrassed they didn't know what to
[03:10:04.040 --> 03:10:08.480]  do the coach and the managers they all apologized but it happened look we have to deal with
[03:10:08.480 --> 03:10:13.360]  reality and you know it all started because they said we need surveillance we need proper
[03:10:13.360 --> 03:10:18.560]  surveillance we have people that truly are evil and they're coming from some place and
[03:10:18.560 --> 03:10:23.120]  you know sort of where they're coming from at least the vicinity and I said we need proper
[03:10:23.120 --> 03:10:27.280]  surveillance whether it's a mosque or any place else we have to be surveilled and we
[03:10:27.280 --> 03:10:31.640]  have to see what's coming at us because we're not going to have a country anymore between
[03:10:31.640 --> 03:10:35.920]  the weak borders that we have the pathetic and weak borders where politicians are afraid
[03:10:35.920 --> 03:10:41.720]  to do anything about it between all of what's happening with radical you know you look at
[03:10:41.720 --> 03:10:45.160]  what's going on you have a president that doesn't even want to talk about you know the
[03:10:45.160 --> 03:10:50.800]  radical Muslim stuff he doesn't want to mention the word he doesn't want to say it but you
[03:10:50.800 --> 03:10:55.120]  look at what's happening where we have a president that's over there celebrating global warming
[03:10:55.120 --> 03:10:59.720]  and trying to get everybody excited about global warming like that's our number one
[03:10:59.720 --> 03:11:03.960]  problem he considers that to be our number one problem and our number one problem is
[03:11:03.960 --> 03:11:07.320]  what's going on where they want to blow up our cities and they want to blow up our country
[03:11:07.320 --> 03:11:13.000]  that's our number one problem you said months ago bomb the oil of ices in the in the mainstream
[03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:17.480]  media laugh because you said the sky was blue again now the Pentagon says that's the right
[03:11:17.480 --> 03:11:24.320]  thing to do and now you've come out saying quote it looks like that Turkey's on the side
[03:11:24.320 --> 03:11:30.360]  of ices close quote well that the next day the Russians released satellite photos documenting
[03:11:30.360 --> 03:11:35.480]  that there are literally thousands of trucks coming up to the border at these huge terminals
[03:11:35.480 --> 03:11:41.680]  connected to your gun the president's son making billions of dollars total off of this
[03:11:41.680 --> 03:11:46.800]  again you're in trouble for saying the sky is blue well I was right about that I was
[03:11:46.800 --> 03:11:50.480]  right in saying in a book that I wrote you covered it really nicely I appreciate it but
[03:11:50.480 --> 03:11:55.440]  I wrote a very political book years ago in the year 2000 the America we deserve and I
[03:11:55.440 --> 03:11:59.680]  said to that book that we better be careful with this guy named Osama bin Laden I mean
[03:11:59.680 --> 03:12:04.600]  I really study this stuff I really find it very interesting and even though I'm a businessman
[03:12:04.600 --> 03:12:09.760]  I find it I've always found I always have been involved in politics I said we better be careful
[03:12:09.760 --> 03:12:14.040]  with Osama bin Laden there's a guy named Osama bin Laden nobody really know who he was but
[03:12:14.040 --> 03:12:18.560]  he was nasty he was saying really nasty things about our country and what he wants to do to
[03:12:18.560 --> 03:12:22.640]  it and I wrote in the book 2000 two years before the World Trade Center came down I
[03:12:22.640 --> 03:12:26.680]  talked about Osama bin Laden you better take him out I said he's gonna crawl under a rock
[03:12:26.680 --> 03:12:31.520]  you better take him out and now people are seeing that the saying you know Trump predicted
[03:12:31.520 --> 03:12:35.640]  Osama bin Laden which actually is true and then two years later a year and a half later
[03:12:35.640 --> 03:12:39.200]  he knocked down the World Trade Center and I talked about terrorism and that that was
[03:12:39.200 --> 03:12:43.680]  before terrorism as we know it today I said we better be careful that's gonna happen it's
[03:12:43.680 --> 03:12:47.840]  gonna be a big thing and it certainly is a big thing so with the oil and I'm glad you
[03:12:47.840 --> 03:12:51.240]  brought it up but as you know for three years I've been saying you better take out the oil
[03:12:51.240 --> 03:12:55.080]  because if you don't take the oil it's gonna be a problem so we shouldn't have been in
[03:12:55.080 --> 03:13:01.280]  Iraq but once we got there the way Osama the way we came out was was horrible and I said
[03:13:01.280 --> 03:13:06.240]  take the oil then we didn't take the oil so ISIS got the oil and as you know Iran is getting
[03:13:06.240 --> 03:13:10.520]  the oil because Iran is gonna take over all of Iraq the more I research what you've actually
[03:13:10.520 --> 03:13:16.920]  said and done it's amazing you were the only leading American figure who openly said do
[03:13:16.920 --> 03:13:22.560]  not go to war on Iraq they had almost what 90% votes in Congress for it bipartisan you
[03:13:22.560 --> 03:13:27.720]  said don't do it Iran will take over you I mean look you can say that today and everybody
[03:13:27.720 --> 03:13:34.040]  can say that but you said that in 2001 2002 2003 but it was very unpopular because you've
[03:13:34.040 --> 03:13:38.520]  done your research and had good advisors how did you know that when almost no one else did
[03:13:38.520 --> 03:13:43.160]  well first of all I'm the most militaristic person there is I'm gonna build the mill if
[03:13:43.160 --> 03:13:47.160]  I win I'm gonna make our military so strong so powerful that nobody's gonna mess with
[03:13:47.160 --> 03:13:51.360]  us we're gonna take care of our vets and all of that but I have to tell you have to know
[03:13:51.360 --> 03:13:54.360]  if you're gonna go to war you have to do it properly and you have to know what to do
[03:13:54.360 --> 03:14:00.320]  I view it as this Iran and Iraq were the same in terms of strength and they'd had they constantly
[03:14:00.320 --> 03:14:04.400]  fighting that's all they do is they fight right they go to war all the time and they'd
[03:14:04.400 --> 03:14:08.760]  move 10 feet left 10 feet right 10 feet left and that rest and then they've started again
[03:14:08.760 --> 03:14:14.720]  four years ago this has been gone on for forever and this is the way it is I said if you take
[03:14:14.720 --> 03:14:19.560]  out Iran or if you take out Iraq either one you're gonna destabilize the Middle East well
[03:14:19.560 --> 03:14:25.720]  we took out Iraq and by the way Iraq has the second largest oil reserves in the world people
[03:14:25.720 --> 03:14:30.280]  don't even know that so we gave like incredible we took out Iraq I said you're gonna destabilize
[03:14:30.280 --> 03:14:35.640]  well and I said and you'll know this and you know this and I appreciate what you just said
[03:14:35.640 --> 03:14:41.080]  then Iran is gonna come in and Iran is going to take over Iraq and they just taking it
[03:14:41.080 --> 03:14:45.040]  over right now as we speak they're taking it over Iran is running Iraq and very soon
[03:14:45.040 --> 03:14:49.560]  will be virtually gonna be totally running Iraq especially after all of the you know the deal
[03:14:49.560 --> 03:14:55.400]  we just made which is the worst so I said keep the oil and I said if you're gonna leave
[03:14:55.400 --> 03:14:58.520]  you shouldn't have gone in but they shouldn't have they should have left soldiers behind
[03:14:58.520 --> 03:15:02.760]  like 20,000 or certain number of soldiers but if you're gonna leave take the oil and
[03:15:02.760 --> 03:15:07.720]  I've said it then they left they didn't take the oil so ISIS got the oil Iran is getting
[03:15:07.720 --> 03:15:12.080]  the oil everybody's getting everything but us so we lost thousands of soldiers we spent
[03:15:12.080 --> 03:15:16.640]  two trillion dollars in Iraq we have wounded warriors who I love all over the place and
[03:15:16.640 --> 03:15:20.520]  what do we get out of it else we had nothing we have nothing no the French and the Germans
[03:15:20.520 --> 03:15:24.120]  are getting the oil the Iranians are getting the oil and you know who the number one customer
[03:15:24.120 --> 03:15:29.920]  for the oil is guess what China right smart is China they are smartest on every level
[03:15:29.920 --> 03:15:35.640]  militarily they are smartest on trade like we're losing we have a 450 billion dollar
[03:15:35.640 --> 03:15:39.400]  trade deficit with China let me ask you this you're a top business guy you know on your
[03:15:39.400 --> 03:15:46.760]  own from nothing how did China get 97% of rare earth in minerals in the world how is
[03:15:46.760 --> 03:15:50.000]  the United States or nobody else even trying to get rare earth minerals when it's what
[03:15:50.000 --> 03:15:54.440]  goes in the smart phones the computers trillions is made a year how did we just give them the
[03:15:54.440 --> 03:15:59.120]  global market in that that's crazy well what a lot of people don't know Afghanistan now
[03:15:59.120 --> 03:16:03.040]  Afghanistan is a place we can go in because you know you have Pakistan and you have nuclear
[03:16:03.040 --> 03:16:08.320]  weapons a lot of things going on there but we go into Afghanistan we're fighting your
[03:16:08.320 --> 03:16:13.640]  tremendous mountains and ridges we're fighting on one side and you know who's got their excavators
[03:16:13.640 --> 03:16:17.360]  on the other side China looking out all the minerals you know Afghanistan nobody knew
[03:16:17.360 --> 03:16:23.880]  this Afghanistan is rich with minerals not oil but minerals everything and China is taking
[03:16:23.880 --> 03:16:27.680]  out all the minerals and here we are fighting we have trillions where but like a trillion
[03:16:27.680 --> 03:16:31.600]  dollars in Afghanistan and we get nothing out of it and we're going to end up leaving
[03:16:31.600 --> 03:16:36.520]  and keeping a couple of thousand soldiers there and this and that we get nothing China
[03:16:36.520 --> 03:16:41.000]  is taking out the minerals they're the they're the buyers the big buyers at very very low
[03:16:41.000 --> 03:16:46.600]  prices of as you know of the oil in Iraq and probably in Syria but China is a big buyer
[03:16:46.600 --> 03:16:50.840]  of the oil but one thing with the oil it's sort of because you've covered it for three
[03:16:50.840 --> 03:16:55.160]  years I've been saying hit the oil because ISIS is getting strong and then no JV as the
[03:16:55.160 --> 03:17:01.200]  president said and they're certainly not contained but I said hit the oil and hit them hard and
[03:17:01.200 --> 03:17:05.640]  they left at me and they would put generals on television saying no that strategy wouldn't
[03:17:05.640 --> 03:17:09.720]  work well after Paris they started hitting the oil and it does work the problem is we've
[03:17:09.720 --> 03:17:14.880]  given them a two-year edge and billions of dollars started hitting the oil for one month
[03:17:14.880 --> 03:17:19.680]  that ISIS is already rolling over can you speak to as president what your relationship
[03:17:19.680 --> 03:17:24.400]  would be with foreign leaders and what you know about Vladimir Putin because all I know
[03:17:24.400 --> 03:17:28.480]  is why are we starting to fight with Russia when they're not doing anything to us right
[03:17:28.480 --> 03:17:32.240]  well number one and just to finish on the other way I say hit the other way we should
[03:17:32.240 --> 03:17:35.800]  keep the oil in other words we should keep we'll get ExxonMobil they'll go in we'll get
[03:17:35.800 --> 03:17:39.720]  other of our oil companies we'll get some of the great oil companies we bid it out we
[03:17:39.720 --> 03:17:43.320]  should keep the oil you know in the old days to the victor belong to spoils right we don't
[03:17:43.320 --> 03:17:48.120]  have that we go in we fight a war and we leave we get nothing except we get debt and we get
[03:17:48.120 --> 03:17:52.880]  deficit that's all we get I think I get along great with people I mean I will probably get
[03:17:52.880 --> 03:17:56.800]  along well with him and if I don't somebody else will and who knows you know he's a difficult
[03:17:56.800 --> 03:18:02.680]  cookie he's tough and he's smart I was on the show 60 minutes with him recently not
[03:18:02.680 --> 03:18:06.360]  together I mean we they did him and they profiled me at the same show which was there we were
[03:18:06.360 --> 03:18:11.920]  stablemates right but I think I get along very well with him I think it's too fine but here's
[03:18:11.920 --> 03:18:15.840]  the thing we lose with every country and yet we don't get along with any countries China
[03:18:15.840 --> 03:18:21.040]  is killing us everybody's killing us China is just beating us to a pulp and trade Japan
[03:18:21.040 --> 03:18:25.280]  Mexico is killing us and yet we don't get along with anybody with me they're not going
[03:18:25.280 --> 03:18:30.000]  to get so rich believe me what about crippled America it's a number one you got a big rally
[03:18:30.000 --> 03:18:33.760]  tonight everywhere you go your crowd just get bigger I mean obviously you're probably
[03:18:33.760 --> 03:18:38.880]  going to get the Republican nomination now wow and you're ready for the dirty tricks one
[03:18:38.880 --> 03:18:42.760]  minute left Donald Trump what do you have to say about your book and what's coming up
[03:18:42.760 --> 03:18:46.080]  well first of all before the book is you mentioned one thing I had never heard that but I am
[03:18:46.080 --> 03:18:50.440]  in this to win it I am not in this to say oh gee I've done a really good job a reporter
[03:18:50.440 --> 03:18:53.920]  called up a very powerful reporter said how does it feel how does it feel said it only
[03:18:53.920 --> 03:18:57.840]  feels because they said what we've done has never been done before politically and I've
[03:18:57.840 --> 03:19:02.240]  been in the polls for five months since it came out I'm number one I said it's only good
[03:19:02.240 --> 03:19:06.520]  if we win if I if I don't win I've wasted a lot of time that's the way I've you said
[03:19:06.520 --> 03:19:11.120]  no no you haven't you haven't I said believe me if I don't win because we can't do anything
[03:19:11.120 --> 03:19:14.920]  to make our country great if I don't win I'll be watching television someplace it'll be
[03:19:14.920 --> 03:19:20.720]  forget it so I wrote a book called crippled America it's doing a fantastic business I
[03:19:20.720 --> 03:19:24.760]  don't know if you can see that thing right up here but it's doing great business I hope

[03:24:14.600 --> 03:24:19.360]  although I'm not the first in fact Van Jones went out on election night got on CNN and
[03:24:19.360 --> 03:24:23.840]  said it's white lash and that's the reason it happened because white people are so bad
[03:24:23.840 --> 03:24:27.560]  and evil and mad that they want to send a message that a woman couldn't be president
[03:24:27.560 --> 03:24:31.240]  talked about race and we talked about everything but race tonight we've talked about income
[03:24:31.240 --> 03:24:34.560]  we've talked about class we've talked about region we haven't talked about race this was
[03:24:34.560 --> 03:24:41.360]  a white lash this was a white lash against a changing country it was a white lash against
[03:24:41.360 --> 03:24:46.480]  a black president in part and then last night we had Samantha B saying white people ruined
[03:24:46.480 --> 03:24:51.040]  America that's right here's the clip people will be looking for someone to blame the
[03:24:51.040 --> 03:24:56.880]  pollsters the strident feminists the Democratic Party a vengeful God but once you dust for
[03:24:56.880 --> 03:25:02.760]  fingerprints it's pretty clear who ruined America white people she then joked and said
[03:25:02.760 --> 03:25:06.560]  oh I guess ruining Brooklyn was a dry run that's right because somebody who builds up
[03:25:06.560 --> 03:25:12.480]  properties and hires people to build them and maintain them is running America and running
[03:25:12.480 --> 03:25:17.120]  jobs just like he did in DC with the new post office in fact the government gave him the
[03:25:17.120 --> 03:25:21.520]  bid and he brought it in under budget and under time that's terrible that's the wrong
[03:25:21.520 --> 03:25:25.360]  thing to do Donald you're doing a horrible disservice to our country but wait we got
[03:25:25.360 --> 03:25:31.160]  more comedians here's Chelsea Handler literally breaking down in tears that Hillary Clinton
[03:25:31.160 --> 03:25:36.480]  didn't win and I think I guess the message that I want to like spread out to other women
[03:25:36.480 --> 03:25:44.520]  is is exactly what you're saying is not to give up sorry I hate my camera but is not
[03:25:44.520 --> 03:25:48.960]  to give up because this is so important and it's easy to say throw in the towel and that
[03:25:48.960 --> 03:25:52.840]  we're gonna leave or I'm gonna move to Spain because I want to move to Spain I really really
[03:25:52.840 --> 03:25:56.560]  want to move to Spain right now and I'm gonna get serious here in a second but let me show
[03:25:56.560 --> 03:26:01.680]  you one more clip here's Seth Meyers wiping away the tears that his mother might not get
[03:26:01.680 --> 03:26:07.680]  to see the first woman president whoever you are I hope I live to see your inauguration
[03:26:07.680 --> 03:26:14.440]  and I hope my mom does too she was really excited yesterday and I was really sad for
[03:26:14.440 --> 03:26:19.400]  her and then he went on to say well the first woman president could still be out there watching
[03:26:19.400 --> 03:26:23.040]  this and then you still get to be the first woman president look people it's not even
[03:26:23.040 --> 03:26:26.920]  the point that Hillary Clinton would have been or not have been the first woman president
[03:26:26.920 --> 03:26:31.520]  she's an evil bitch that's the bottom line in fact one of her first jobs as a public
[03:26:31.520 --> 03:26:36.600]  defender was defending a child rapist and she used tactics on this little girl who we had
[03:26:36.600 --> 03:26:39.840]  just behind me in the studio Kathy Shelton who was 12 years old and she was pulled off
[03:26:39.840 --> 03:26:46.360]  her bike and gang raped how's that for feminism okay and Hillary went on to take evidence and
[03:26:46.360 --> 03:26:51.600]  move it across state lines she mishandled evidence in this case she actually took this little
[03:26:51.600 --> 03:26:56.240]  girl brought her up on the stand and made her cry and she was using tactics now that
[03:26:56.240 --> 03:27:02.160]  are illegal under rape shield laws does that sound like a person that needs to be president
[03:27:02.160 --> 03:27:08.760]  they jerked me off my bicycle they put me in this truck and they were beating me they
[03:27:08.760 --> 03:27:17.320]  and they raped me and he was saying he knew I liked it except in a more terribly manner
[03:27:17.320 --> 03:27:28.800]  than that I was left out on the ground fairly conscious sometimes at one time I was unconscious
[03:27:28.800 --> 03:27:35.240]  hmm it's pretty funny though watching people like Colbert on the Colbert report having
[03:27:35.240 --> 03:27:39.000]  his election night special when they knew Hillary was gonna win they knew without a
[03:27:39.000 --> 03:27:42.680]  shadow of a doubt because she had sewn it up in the polls and that they had it was just
[03:27:42.680 --> 03:27:46.800]  nothing but little bit of a racist white people that were gonna vote for Trump and then watching
[03:27:46.800 --> 03:27:52.400]  them just almost cry on TV as they saw the results coming in it's even funnier watching
[03:27:52.400 --> 03:27:58.000]  the young Turks as a whole panel watching the utter disdain on their faces because they
[03:27:58.000 --> 03:28:03.480]  lost get over it let's move on now let's not keep encouraging people by going it's only
[03:28:03.480 --> 03:28:09.360]  racist doing it because I'm not a racist and I voted for Donald Trump period and there's
[03:28:09.360 --> 03:28:12.440]  plenty of other people that voted for them that aren't racist either and we don't have
[03:28:12.440 --> 03:28:17.800]  a desire to hate women and ruin this country with misogyny or xenophobia all we want to
[03:28:17.800 --> 03:28:24.080]  do is protect the border have fair elections and have a decent economy where everybody
[03:28:24.080 --> 03:28:28.440]  has a chance to succeed and if you don't want that for people if you think you have to run

[03:33:16.200 --> 03:33:22.600]  trump roger stone this is a surreal moment for you tell us your heart and soul you know
[03:33:22.600 --> 03:33:30.040]  alex i wanted donald trump to run for president as early as 1988 i arranged for him to speak
[03:33:30.040 --> 03:33:37.680]  to the chamber of commerce uh in port smith new hampshire and a port smith city councilman
[03:33:37.680 --> 03:33:44.560]  named mike dunbar formed the first known draft umpere president committee he was still working
[03:33:44.560 --> 03:33:48.360]  for trump in the most recent new hampshire primary now you gave me a six months ago like
[03:33:48.360 --> 03:33:54.320]  a big present oh here's a doll from 2000 thing nobody's got this yeah so uh in 2000 i wanted
[03:33:54.320 --> 03:34:00.040]  him to seek the reform party nomination because i could see that george bush and al gore were
[03:34:00.040 --> 03:34:08.440]  not what america needed uh and uh he did seriously consider that briefly uh bros perot urged him
[03:34:08.440 --> 03:34:14.640]  to run my friend jesse ventura then governor minnesota urged him to run uh and um he did
[03:34:14.640 --> 03:34:18.920]  look at it and of course the reform party then was entitled to federal matching funds
[03:34:18.920 --> 03:34:25.560]  so he would have been running on opm other people's money in the end he made what i think
[03:34:25.560 --> 03:34:29.440]  was a shrewd calculation that you couldn't win as a third party candidate you could only
[03:34:29.440 --> 03:34:34.520]  win as a republican or a democrat three years ago i wanted him to run i signed up again as
[03:34:34.520 --> 03:34:41.520]  a consultant to his uh exploratory effort uh and the time was really not quite right
[03:34:41.520 --> 03:34:48.720]  i was probably more for it than he was so this has been a long time coming for me i
[03:34:48.720 --> 03:34:53.880]  have taken the beating from my friends and some people who aren't my friends for 30 years
[03:34:53.880 --> 03:34:59.680]  of saying oh don't come on you're out of your mind he's never going to run this is all about
[03:34:59.680 --> 03:35:04.320]  burnishing the brand this is all about his is uh you know the fact that he's a media
[03:35:04.320 --> 03:35:09.200]  whore and he just likes to read his name he's never really going to do it so um this is
[03:35:09.200 --> 03:35:16.000]  vindication they've been proven wrong in space what have they a royal flush for roger stone
[03:35:16.000 --> 03:35:21.720]  uh it is it is a great night i can't wait to hear what he has to say here i would like
[03:35:21.720 --> 03:35:30.360]  him to claim this so that the moment will be complete and it's 144 about to be 145 central
[03:35:30.360 --> 03:35:36.000]  time i'm here with roger stone history is happening now there's donald trump let's fade

[03:54:34.560 --> 03:54:43.360]  but donald trump's will is that you be prosperous and let you be successful no dream is too big no
[03:54:43.360 --> 03:54:51.040]  challenge is too great nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach america will no longer
[03:54:51.040 --> 03:54:58.880]  settle for anything less than the best and that's why goldman sacks and jp morgan all big mega banks
[03:54:58.880 --> 03:55:05.920]  have set themselves up against him because they believe they own you i knew a year and a half ago
[03:55:05.920 --> 03:55:14.240]  when i endorsed donald trump he was going to win and i've talked to him about why i knew that but
[03:55:14.240 --> 03:55:20.160]  people i know and people i trust that are patriots that have defended this republic
[03:55:22.720 --> 03:55:25.920]  confirmed to me and i've seen it in donald trump's actions
[03:55:28.400 --> 03:55:33.280]  that he wanted to restore this republic but i want to be very clear to you very clear
[03:55:33.280 --> 03:55:38.160]  yeah there isn't about credit it's so that you know the danger
[03:55:40.560 --> 03:55:46.080]  you've seen the stupid ads with the bunny rabbit that says energizer inside if you want to know
[03:55:46.080 --> 03:55:52.800]  what powers donald trump individually it's a love of liberty and a love of standing up to
[03:55:52.800 --> 03:55:57.440]  corruption he's not perfect nobody is but what powers the movement is info wars
[03:55:57.440 --> 03:56:05.680]  they want to establish a private corporate global government nigel ferrash
[03:56:08.000 --> 03:56:12.320]  the leader of uke we come on my shelf 15 years ago when he barely had a few members
[03:56:13.200 --> 03:56:18.240]  of part of it now he's a hundred times bigger or more and he would say it's your listeners
[03:56:18.240 --> 03:56:21.440]  listening to you in the u.s when i go knock on doors that's why we're getting the uk
[03:56:21.440 --> 03:56:26.560]  independence party it's it's info wars thank you he said that on the show and thought about us bragging
[03:56:26.560 --> 03:56:32.080]  you said the spirit of the info war across the world from australia to the uk and russia
[03:56:33.600 --> 03:56:35.760]  from nigeria to mexico is spreading
[03:56:38.240 --> 03:56:45.040]  and it's the renaissance idea of freedom and that's why they're trying to shut us down
[03:56:45.040 --> 03:56:50.960]  because we're not perfect but we're not out to get people we believe in lower taxes we know
[03:56:50.960 --> 03:56:56.960]  empowering the people's answer we don't want to break up families we're not out to get people
[03:56:58.560 --> 03:57:03.600]  they are going to try to collapse the world economy they've already been propping it up for a while
[03:57:03.600 --> 03:57:08.880]  they're going to blame it on donald trump a global depression they knew they couldn't stop the movement
[03:57:09.440 --> 03:57:13.520]  so now that he's in they're going to implode the economy and blame him
[03:57:13.520 --> 03:57:18.320]  when they're the ones who created the derivatives when they're the ones who created the end of last
[03:57:18.320 --> 03:57:22.480]  teagle when hillary clinton and larry summers did it all they're going to blame donald's realm
[03:57:25.440 --> 03:57:29.280]  how do i know that they threatened the uk they said you try to leave this unelected thing
[03:57:29.280 --> 03:57:33.360]  we'll implode your economy we'll take your jobs away just like they did at iceland or greece
[03:57:33.360 --> 03:57:38.080]  some countries fold some fight back we know they're playing if you're just conscious and want to know
[03:57:38.080 --> 03:57:44.800]  the truth it's all there it's not my opinion i want self-determination i won't be hold hostage
[03:57:44.800 --> 03:57:55.280]  so this isn't like buying a lottery ticket where you elect donald trump and beat the establishment
[03:57:55.280 --> 03:58:00.560]  and then expect the whole gravy train to continue on who wants this fake gravy train
[03:58:01.760 --> 03:58:06.000]  we need to get back to what makes us human what makes us real and if we're getting ahead of the
