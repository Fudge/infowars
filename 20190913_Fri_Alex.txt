[00:00.000 --> 00:26.400]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[00:30.000 --> 00:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen what we witnessed last night the fifth debate by the Democrats all 10 of them on the stage at the same time
[00:41.000 --> 00:49.000]  was an open declaration of war against everything this nation stands for. It was offering everybody all this free pirate booty
[00:49.000 --> 01:01.000]  it was saying we are going to confiscate 90% of the guns in this country are semi automatic. They want to go down to only single shot. This is everything we knew was coming all along in their internal documents.
[01:01.000 --> 01:11.000]  I've got all these clips coming up of Joe Biden saying 10 years ago, 5 years ago, 3 years ago. Nobody wants your guns. Nobody is going after your rifle, your shotgun, your semi auto.
[01:11.000 --> 01:23.000]  That's a lie of the Republicans. That's a lie of the NRA. Now all of them pledging to take the guns and they keep saying get them off the streets. They mean come to your house and confiscate them.
[01:23.000 --> 01:36.000]  And then Beto O'Rourke. Beto O'Rourke the hit and run criminal, the guy that wrote essays about murdering children. The guy that puts cheeseburgers on English muffins.
[01:36.000 --> 01:44.000]  The guy that you couldn't trust with anything. Well here he is throwing down the gauntlet.
[01:44.000 --> 01:56.000]  Americans who own AR-15s and AK-47s will have to sell them to the government, all of them. You know the critics call this confiscation. Are you proposing taking away their guns and how would this work?
[01:56.000 --> 02:16.000]  I am if it's a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield. If the high impact, high velocity round when it hits your body shreds everything inside of your body because it was designed to do that so that you would bleed to death on a battlefield
[02:16.000 --> 02:31.000]  and be able to get up and kill one of our soldiers. When we see that being used against children and in Odessa I met the mother of a 15 year old girl who was shot by an AR-15 and that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour
[02:31.000 --> 02:42.000]  because so many other people were shot by that AR-15 in Odessa and Midland. There weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time. Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.
[02:42.000 --> 02:48.000]  We're not going to allow it to be used against fellow Americans anymore.
[02:48.000 --> 02:57.000]  Everything he said there of course is a twisted lie. I mean there are more people dying every year getting stabbed to death than beaten with baseball bats. The highest crime rates are where they've taken all the guns from law abiding.
[02:57.000 --> 03:07.000]  We know all this, but he appeals to a motion and then they all agreed in the media made beto holding it less than 1% the star.
[03:07.000 --> 03:15.000]  And now they're promising to come after your guns. This would cause obviously a civil war. It's how the country was founded when the British Redcoats came to take the guns.
[03:15.000 --> 03:25.000]  It's simply insane. We come back, we've got a compilation of more of them saying this and we've got Joe Biden promising just a few years ago that nobody's coming to take your guns.
[03:25.000 --> 03:33.000]  I knew he'd said it five years ago, ten years ago, but we've got video of him just a few years ago on C-SPAN saying the same thing.
[03:33.000 --> 03:41.000]  They've always wanted to get the guns. We know that. We understand that it has nothing to do with the 300 people a year that die and quote mass shootings.
[03:41.000 --> 03:47.000]  Less than 200 of those are actually what you call a classical real mass shooting when the guy goes out to do it.
[03:47.000 --> 03:56.000]  Sometimes people get caught in crossfire of gang related stuff. The truth is ladies and gentlemen that being shot in this country by a criminal is way down the list.
[03:56.000 --> 04:04.000]  Depending on the World Almanac every year, it's 15, 16, 17, 18th way people die unnaturally in this country.
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.000]  The worst back in the 80s, we had a big crime wave. It was like number 10.
[04:08.000 --> 04:16.000]  And the statistics vary, but I've had John Lott and top professors on who are just widely renowned as some of the top statisticians there are.
[04:16.000 --> 04:24.000]  They'll tell you that, but we all know that. And we all know crime is located mainly in the crime infested areas, but the left controls.
[04:24.000 --> 04:30.000]  And so this was just amazing. And, you know, they want to kill babies after they're born now. They're doing it.
[04:30.000 --> 04:35.000]  And the left celebrates abortion. Boy, they really love life, don't they? But they want you disarmed.
[04:35.000 --> 04:42.000]  They want to finish their conquest of criminal fraud against us. They have the New York Times worshipping Mao Zedong and all of his mass murder.
[04:42.000 --> 04:49.000]  These people are authoritarians and they're trying to bankrupt and collapse this nation. They're trying to fight the recovery that Trump's pushing.
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.000]  These people are the plague. They're globalists and they hate this nation.
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  We'll be right back on Alex Jones.
[05:23.000 --> 05:36.000]  B-12 deficiency is a serious problem that could cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[05:36.000 --> 05:45.000]  Bottom line, folks, you need Ultra-12. It helps fund the InfoWare towards the 360 win and it's 50% off for a limited time at infowarstore.com.
[05:45.000 --> 05:57.000]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last. Ultra-12, twice as powerful, half the price, 50% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[06:00.000 --> 06:06.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:06.000 --> 06:16.000]  Well, we're getting a compilation of Joe Biden 12 years ago, 10 years ago, 5 years ago, 2 years ago saying nobody wants your guns.
[06:16.000 --> 06:22.000]  Nobody's putting you in a database to confiscate them. Special forces troops aren't coming to get them. Not your rifle, not your shotgun, not any of them.
[06:22.000 --> 06:25.000]  But here's a clip from just a few years ago of Biden.
[06:25.000 --> 06:38.000]  And then we'll play you some excerpts from last night when the Democrats let it all hang out that they want to finish their conquest of the United States and fully disarm us.
[06:38.000 --> 06:55.000]  No central registry for anything. No way that Uncle Sam can go find out whether you own a gun because we're about to really take away all your rights and you're going to be able to defend yourself.
[06:55.000 --> 07:03.000]  We're going to swoop down with special forces folks and gather up every gun in America. It's bizarre.
[07:03.000 --> 07:08.000]  But that's just being sold out there.
[07:08.000 --> 07:18.000]  All we're suggesting is we'll be able to add to the existing system. No information. We're not adding any more information.
[07:18.000 --> 07:26.000]  Over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street, period, and we have to get buybacks and get them out of their basements.
[07:26.000 --> 07:33.000]  In recent days, former Vice President Biden has said about executive order, some really talented people are seeking the nomination.
[07:33.000 --> 07:41.000]  They said, I'm going to issue an executive order, Biden saying there's no constitutional authority to issue that executive order when they say I'm going to eliminate assault weapons.
[07:41.000 --> 07:43.000]  Does the vice president have a point there?
[07:43.000 --> 07:50.000]  Well, I mean, I would just say, hey, Joe, instead of saying, no, we can't. Let's say yes, we can.
[07:50.000 --> 07:57.000]  Let's be constitutional. And yes, we can, because I'll tell you something.
[07:57.000 --> 08:07.000]  Well, do you think Trump is responsible for what happened? And I said, well, look, I mean, obviously he didn't pull the trigger, but he's certainly been tweeting out the ammunition.
[08:07.000 --> 08:12.000]  By the way, you can't own the following weapons, period. They cannot be sold anymore.
[08:12.000 --> 08:21.000]  You said, quote, Americans who own AR-15s and AK-47s will have to sell them to the government, all of them. You know, the critics call this confiscation.
[08:21.000 --> 08:25.000]  Are you proposing taking away their guns? And how would this work?
[08:25.000 --> 08:32.000]  I am. If it's a weapon that was designed to kill people. Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.
[08:32.000 --> 08:37.000]  We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.
[08:37.000 --> 08:48.000]  Everyone up here favors an assault weapon ban. Everyone up here favors magazine limitations, which, by the way, would have made a huge difference if that was in place.
[08:48.000 --> 08:54.000]  They know full well you have a couple hundred people killed a year in mass shootings. It's super rare. They hype it up. That actually causes more people to do it.
[08:54.000 --> 08:58.000]  They're hoping for it. These are criminals that want to disarm their slaves. They're fully aware of what they're doing.
[08:58.000 --> 09:04.000]  They don't talk about the 200,000 dead in Mexico the last 10 years, where they have a total ban on guns for citizens, but one of the highest crime rates in the world.
[09:04.000 --> 09:09.000]  Chicago ban on guns, highest crime rate in the U.S. These dirtbags know what they're doing. They're not idiots.
[09:09.000 --> 09:13.000]  They're wanton front men of international criminals that want to enslave this nation.
[09:13.000 --> 09:23.000]  1776 is why this country started when the Redcoats came to take the guns. And if they try to take our firearms, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[09:23.000 --> 09:37.000]  It doesn't matter how many freaking lemons you get out there telling us that we've got to be your slaves. We're not. Get it through your head.
[09:37.000 --> 09:41.000]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen. That's from the YouTube channel, New Supreme. This is some good guys.
[09:41.000 --> 09:44.000]  I'm going to get them on the show sometime to put some good compilations out.
[09:44.000 --> 09:57.000]  Some of the great patriots out there. Here's the deal. Back in the 60s, the United Nations, the Carnegie Endowment, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Endowment,
[09:57.000 --> 10:03.000]  the guys that set up the U.N., the guys that set up this world government system, they went on national news.
[10:03.000 --> 10:16.000]  They went in the New York Times. Somewhere in our warehouse storage area, I've got a whole binder that was put together by a research group out in California
[10:16.000 --> 10:26.000]  that all the old New York Times and Washington Post articles saying the U.N. will occupy America. All guns will be taken.
[10:26.000 --> 10:35.000]  There will be no single-family homes. Everyone will live in dormitory, high-rise buildings. We will blur the sexes.
[10:35.000 --> 10:46.000]  We will sterilize people. And so they try to come out with this in the 60s, and people are like, this is insane.
[10:46.000 --> 11:00.000]  And so they pulled back, and then for the 70s and 80s and 90s, said, oh, none of this exists. Crazy people are saying it.
[11:00.000 --> 11:06.000]  But it was always their plan. So people keep asking, Alex, how is it all coming true? How does you know this?
[11:06.000 --> 11:17.000]  It's like going to a play on Broadway, and you get a program, and it shows you the third act, the second act, the first act,
[11:17.000 --> 11:28.000]  and you start at the first act, and it tells you whether you're watching Romeo and Juliet or whether you're watching Cats or Best of the Whorehouse in Texas.
[11:28.000 --> 11:37.000]  I mean, whatever it is, you know how the play goes. It's a program. General Parton would always explain that to me.
[11:37.000 --> 11:47.000]  He goes, Jones, you can get caught in the minutiae all day. It's a program. It's ultra-rich using a communist model to get rid of free market capitalism and create a consolidation.
[11:47.000 --> 11:53.000]  You've got to understand the communist program. And they're following a program, culture war, race war, all of this.
[11:53.000 --> 11:59.000]  And the big, rich billionaires set off short tax exempt, orchestrating all of this, making fun of us.
[11:59.000 --> 12:04.000]  And Trump comes along and tries to stop it, and all hell breaks loose.
[12:04.000 --> 12:09.000]  The Democrats say they want to arrest conservatives. They say they want to put us in forced labor camps.
[12:09.000 --> 12:17.000]  They say they want to kill us. They say they want to flatten us and demolish us and destroy us.
[12:17.000 --> 12:24.000]  And they do it over and over and over again. And sure, it sounds extreme to say all this.
[12:24.000 --> 12:29.000]  It sounded pretty extreme in 1939 when Hitler invaded Poland, too.
[12:29.000 --> 12:34.000]  But when you get hit by something, you know, it's pretty extreme to come home and there's a home invader in your house.
[12:34.000 --> 12:41.000]  That happened once we came home from church. When I was a kid, the guy around at the back door scared the hell out of my mom.
[12:41.000 --> 12:48.000]  My dad was taking groceries in. He came in and, you know, it's like having a car wreck. You can't believe you had it.
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.000]  You look over at your arms chopped off and blood squirting. You got to put a tourniquet on it.
[12:52.000 --> 13:01.000]  I mean, this is the real world, folks. We got a case, a hardcore, globalist, communist-funded, Marxist-Leninist, Saul Alinsky cancer.
[13:01.000 --> 13:08.000]  And if we don't cut the stuff out, it's going to go all the way because it's what it does.
[13:08.000 --> 13:16.000]  So a normal person sits back and watches all this and can't believe it.
[13:16.000 --> 13:23.000]  And that's because it doesn't make sense because you're not a psychotic control freak, lusting after total power and control.
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  I mean, the biggest thing of the night didn't get any attention.
[13:25.000 --> 13:31.000]  Kamala Harris said, as a president, you decide executive order to confiscate all the guns.
[13:31.000 --> 13:36.000]  And he says, well, you can't do that. It's got to be a law. People, even Congress, can't violate the Second Amendment.
[13:36.000 --> 13:40.000]  So the Supreme Court comes in. But it certainly doesn't come from the executive.
[13:40.000 --> 13:45.000]  She calls for a dictatorship to Joe Biden. He says, we can't do that in the Constitution.
[13:45.000 --> 13:52.000]  She says, oh, just say yes, we can. It's so creepy. It's so skexy-like. It's so over the top. Here is that clip.
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.000]  In recent days, former vice president Biden has said about executive order.
[13:56.000 --> 14:01.000]  Some really talented people are seeking the nomination. They said, I'm going to issue an executive order.
[14:01.000 --> 14:07.000]  Biden's saying there's no constitutional authority to issue that executive order when they say I'm going to eliminate assault weapons.
[14:07.000 --> 14:13.000]  Saying you can't do it by executive order any more than Trump can do things when he says he can do it by executive order.
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  Does the vice president have a point there?
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  Some things you can. Many things you can't.
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  Let's let the senator answer.
[14:19.000 --> 14:26.000]  Well, I mean, I would just say, hey, Joe, instead of saying no, we can't. Let's say yes, we can.
[14:26.000 --> 14:33.000]  Let's get constitutional. Yes, we can, because I'll tell you something.
[14:33.000 --> 14:41.000]  The way that I think about this is I've seen more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you.
[14:41.000 --> 14:45.000]  I have attended more police officer funerals than I care to tell you.
[14:45.000 --> 14:51.000]  I have hugged more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you.
[14:51.000 --> 15:09.000]  And the idea that we would wait for this Congress, which has just done nothing to act is just it is it is overlooking the fact that every day in America,
[15:09.000 --> 15:14.000]  our babies are going to school to have drills, elementary, middle and high school students.
[15:14.000 --> 15:21.000]  Yeah, because you guys had your one-smash shooting, you hyped it up, and now you get copycats to do it.
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  This is how you terrorize us, you damn terrorist.
[15:23.000 --> 15:28.000]  Roaming the hallways of their school. I was talking about this at one of my town halls.
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.000]  Well, she was definitely on downers or alcohol. Everybody's saying she was drunk.
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.000]  She came up to me. It was like she was drinking between the two of us.
[15:35.000 --> 15:36.000]  She's choking.
[15:36.000 --> 15:40.000]  And he said, I had to have one of those drills.
[15:40.000 --> 15:46.000]  She's traumatizing our children. El Paso and Beto, God love you.
[15:46.000 --> 15:50.000]  Oh, Beto. Oh, God love you.
[15:50.000 --> 16:19.000]  You disarmed these slaves, more on her, on the other side, getting into all this.
[16:20.000 --> 16:27.000]  I'm going to go to my website, DanPilla.com, that's DanPilla.com, DanPilla.com.
[16:50.000 --> 16:57.000]  That's 866-295-5305, hpextract.com. Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[16:57.000 --> 17:04.000]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me. You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[17:04.000 --> 17:12.000]  I had a problem like you once. I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[17:12.000 --> 17:17.000]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[17:17.000 --> 17:25.000]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[17:25.000 --> 17:32.000]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.

[17:48.000 --> 17:52.000]  800-506-6740.
[17:52.000 --> 18:15.000]  That's 800-506-6740.
[18:22.000 --> 18:46.000]  800-506-6740.
[18:46.000 --> 18:59.000]  800-506-6740.
[18:59.000 --> 19:06.000]  There are few things in this universe that are assured of that, but I'm here to tell you the products that in FullWarsLife.com are.
[19:06.000 --> 19:16.000]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested, most loved, most documented substances that God gave us through Mother Nature.
[19:16.000 --> 19:20.000]  And then we make it even stronger, even better, and lower the price.
[19:20.000 --> 19:26.000]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches, it's good for the immune system.
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  So many things. It sells itself.
[19:28.000 --> 19:37.000]  But normal turmeric only has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant.
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  Originally obviously from India.
[19:39.000 --> 19:45.000]  Well, body's ultimate turmeric formula has a 95% curcuminoid level,
[19:45.000 --> 19:51.000]  and it's got other natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it, and that's why people absolutely love it.
[19:51.000 --> 19:54.000]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet.
[19:54.000 --> 19:58.000]  50% off on bodies at FullWarsLife.com
[20:24.000 --> 20:27.000]  There's going to be more people that poisoned their husbands and wives.
[20:27.000 --> 20:31.000]  There's going to be more child molesters. There's going to be more babies by the millions aborted.
[20:31.000 --> 20:34.000]  And hundreds of thousands kept alive and their organs sold.
[20:34.000 --> 20:40.000]  China's going to continue to have 2 million plus people in Mongolia and forced labor camps.
[20:40.000 --> 20:43.000]  Communism killed over 100 million people last century.
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  The number's close to 200 million.
[20:45.000 --> 20:52.000]  All that's going on, but Beto or Rourke and all them know that their constituents are very stupid and very childlike and very ignorant.
[20:52.000 --> 21:00.000]  So they can seize on individual events and say, look at this terrible thing that happened when another Antifa individual,
[21:00.000 --> 21:03.000]  the man in Ohio, the man in Texas, both were leftist.
[21:03.000 --> 21:11.000]  They were both Antifa, but they covered up the El Paso Shooters pages that said that and put up fake info the day of the shooting after it happened.
[21:11.000 --> 21:13.000]  What a scandal!
[21:13.000 --> 21:22.000]  Let's see, InfoWars has been isolated to AM and FM radio, some TV stations and a big presence at infowars.com and newswars.com,
[21:22.000 --> 21:31.000]  but not to a wider audience, to the choir, to you that's awake and informed, yes, you understand what's happened.
[21:31.000 --> 21:38.000]  You saw that seven-minute compilation of Democrats saying, we love killing babies, they are babies, those little bastards,
[21:38.000 --> 21:42.000]  we love the power of killing little boys and little girls, we like keeping them alive,
[21:42.000 --> 21:46.000]  we like bullying them, it makes us feel good and selfish, we love Satan.
[21:46.000 --> 21:50.000]  And then we showed you mainline news where they're actually doing it.
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  They're not just trying to shock us.
[21:52.000 --> 21:56.000]  Every culture when it starts to collapse brings back child sacrifice.
[21:56.000 --> 21:57.000]  Every culture!
[21:57.000 --> 22:01.000]  Because there's a spirit in the world that has a hunger for it.
[22:01.000 --> 22:11.000]  Christ said, better you to kill yourself by tying a bowler around your neck and throwing yourself in the ocean than to hurt children.
[22:11.000 --> 22:16.000]  And he said, those that do are reserved the greatest spiritual punishment.
[22:16.000 --> 22:21.000]  You're like, well, why would you need to have that? Christ admonishing, I don't want to hurt kids.
[22:21.000 --> 22:23.000]  Well, there are people that do.
[22:26.000 --> 22:28.000]  And the demons haven't been very kind to them.
[22:28.000 --> 22:31.000]  Look at O'Rourke, a torture, a psychotic demon.
[22:31.000 --> 22:40.000]  Look at Sanders, look at all of them, spiritually hunchback, twisted, absolutely out of control.
[22:40.000 --> 22:45.000]  So think about Camilla Harris, and I just played that clip.
[22:45.000 --> 22:47.000]  Oh, there's the Constitution.
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.000]  We can't just have the president be a dictator.
[22:49.000 --> 22:55.000]  She says, yes, we can't do it for the little girl.
[22:55.000 --> 22:57.000]  They're taking our voice.
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.000]  They're attacking our families.
[22:59.000 --> 23:01.000]  They want our right to defend ourselves.
[23:01.000 --> 23:04.000]  Of course, gun cells are up 15%.
[23:04.000 --> 23:09.000]  Because this country's been flooded with tens of millions of illegal aliens, many of them criminals.
[23:09.000 --> 23:15.000]  We've been flooded with enough fentanyl in just one shipment to kill 10 million people.
[23:15.000 --> 23:18.000]  Plus, there are drug addicts everywhere.
[23:18.000 --> 23:22.000]  Homelessness is exploding, and almost all these homeless are on opiates.
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  And again, we're trying to do something. You're trying to do something.
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  Trump's trying to do something.
[23:26.000 --> 23:31.000]  But we are a cursed nation because we kill our unborn.
[23:31.000 --> 23:33.000]  And now, of course, we kill them after they're born.
[23:33.000 --> 23:40.000]  And of course, we euthanize old people now who aren't even brain dead and who are begging for their lives.
[23:40.000 --> 23:43.000]  Because we've become demonic.
[23:43.000 --> 23:47.000]  Not all of us, but a good portion of us.
[23:47.000 --> 23:49.000]  Look at these headlines.
[23:49.000 --> 23:52.000]  Civic Survey, National Survey.
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  StudyFinds.org.
[23:54.000 --> 23:59.000]  One in five Americans can't name single branch of U.S. government.
[23:59.000 --> 24:01.000]  One in five. Who do you think those are?
[24:01.000 --> 24:04.000]  Those are the chief Democrat voters.
[24:04.000 --> 24:09.000]  They don't know how anything works.
[24:09.000 --> 24:15.000]  You can't tell them, hey, Mexico has a homicide rate nine times the U.S.
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.000]  The last numbers are from 2018.
[24:17.000 --> 24:24.000]  200 plus thousand that we know of dead, millions missing.
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.000]  Total gunman for the citizens.
[24:28.000 --> 24:34.000]  I'm going to tell you when we come back from break how to stop this and how to defeat it.
[24:34.000 --> 24:40.000]  First is what's going to happen if they go down the path they're on that will lead to civil war, which is part of their plan as well.
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  Then they'll call you domestic terrorists.
[24:42.000 --> 24:45.000]  And they'll stage events to blame on gun owner groups.
[24:45.000 --> 24:48.000]  Oh, they've got a plan, but we know the plan.
[24:48.000 --> 24:51.000]  We know how to stop it. This is really happening.
[24:51.000 --> 24:52.000]  And people get that now.
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  They know, wait, Jones wasn't, this wasn't hyperbole over the years.
[24:55.000 --> 24:56.000]  He wasn't trying to shock.
[24:56.000 --> 24:57.000]  No, no, no, I'm not trying to shock anybody.
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.000]  The reality is what I want you to face.
[25:00.000 --> 25:04.000]  We can beat this.
[25:04.000 --> 25:15.000]  But here is, again, more of that exchange where Camila Kamala is worshiping Beto, who looks like out of a horror movie, you know, the evil psychos that run the mortuary and are torturing people.
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.000]  I mean, he looks like he could star in a horror movie as a serial killer.
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.000]  He just radiates evil and his actions are incredible.
[25:22.000 --> 25:23.000]  Totally fake.
[25:23.000 --> 25:28.000]  That's all this weird human stuff like changing tires, getting haircuts, cooking hamburgers wrong.
[25:28.000 --> 25:29.000]  I mean, there's something wrong with him.
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.000]  Is he a robot? An alien? No.
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.000]  He's a sociopath.
[25:33.000 --> 25:36.000]  He's a robot that just wants power.
[25:36.000 --> 25:42.000]  It's genetic.
[25:42.000 --> 25:43.000]  There's chromosomal issues.
[25:43.000 --> 25:47.000]  There's disorders that create genetic psychopaths.
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  You look at Zuckerberg, he has the characteristics.
[25:49.000 --> 25:54.000]  Nothing against tall, skinny people. A lot of them are great people, but there's a certain types of genetic disorders.
[25:54.000 --> 25:55.000]  Two of them.
[25:55.000 --> 25:59.000]  I could pull it up and show you where they're very tall, very skinny and have that look.
[25:59.000 --> 26:00.000]  They could be black.
[26:00.000 --> 26:01.000]  They could be white.
[26:01.000 --> 26:10.000]  It's disproportionately associated with being a psychopath, like the character in American Psycho or Christian Bale.
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  That's why you think of that as the psychopath.
[26:12.000 --> 26:18.000]  That look in the eyes, the buck teeth, all of that is a genetic psychopath.
[26:18.000 --> 26:22.000]  And it deals with double chromosomes.
[26:22.000 --> 26:23.000]  Look it up.
[26:23.000 --> 26:28.000]  Look up genetic psychopaths and double chromosomes.
[26:28.000 --> 26:31.000]  Guaranteed he's got a double chromosome.
[26:31.000 --> 26:36.000]  He's a genetic psychopath, which the base floor is sociopathic behavior.
[26:36.000 --> 26:43.000]  And they always try to show you like you're trying to lure a puppy in or, you know, bait deer in by hitting antlers together.
[26:43.000 --> 26:44.000]  They're hunting you.
[26:44.000 --> 26:48.000]  So they always go, look, I'm nonviolent, I'm helpful, I love you.
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  I care about you.
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  I want to work with you.
[26:52.000 --> 26:53.000]  Look, I'm normal.
[26:53.000 --> 26:54.000]  Look, I'm having a beer.
[26:54.000 --> 26:55.000]  I'm like you.
[26:55.000 --> 27:03.000]  You're like, that's totally fake because they have no empathy, but they put on the act of empathy and it's very canned.
[27:03.000 --> 27:10.000]  It's very artificial because these people are obsessed.
[27:10.000 --> 27:14.000]  Yeah, there it is, the psycho gene, and there's more than just that.
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  There's several disorders that cause it.
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.000]  And again, very tall, skinny, that whole look.
[27:20.000 --> 27:23.000]  And again, that's not saying people that normally are tall and skinny are like that.
[27:23.000 --> 27:28.000]  It's very rare, but it's most of your real psychopaths are genetic psychopaths.
[27:28.000 --> 27:32.000]  That's why they're tall, skinny, have the high cheekbones, the buck teeth.
[27:32.000 --> 27:33.000]  It's a disorder.
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  Like down syndrome, you have an extra chromosome.
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.000]  Well, these guys have double chromosomes and it causes the lengthening.
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  But let's go to that clip I was talking about.
[27:41.000 --> 27:42.000]  Here it is.
[27:42.000 --> 27:47.000]  And by the way, the way Beto handled what happened in his hometown is meaningful.
[27:47.000 --> 27:52.000]  But look in the eyes of those people to see those kids, to understand those parents.
[27:52.000 --> 27:54.000]  You understand the heartache.
[27:54.000 --> 28:00.000]  I'm incredibly saddened and it is very hard to think about this.
[28:00.000 --> 28:06.000]  I'm incredibly saddened and it is very hard to think about this.
[28:06.000 --> 28:11.000]  I'm incredibly saddened and it is very hard to think about this.
[28:11.000 --> 28:17.000]  And Beto, God love you for standing so courageously in the midst of that tragedy.
[28:17.000 --> 28:22.000]  I'm incredibly saddened and it is very hard to think about this.
[28:22.000 --> 28:25.000]  There's a reason you're scared of him and it looked like that, you know.
[28:25.000 --> 28:37.000]  But I'll tell you about this.
[28:56.000 --> 28:59.000]  Hello, patriots.
[28:59.000 --> 29:03.000]  My name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[29:03.000 --> 29:08.000]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out-left sanctuary state until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.
[29:08.000 --> 29:13.000]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool our children
[29:13.000 --> 29:16.000]  without the tyranny of the nanny state looking ogres.
[29:16.000 --> 29:22.000]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our BlackRifle Real Estate team is here to help.
[29:22.000 --> 29:27.000]  Go to BlackRifleRealEstate.com. That's BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[29:53.000 --> 29:59.000]  Super Silver Woon Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S. that has their products in hospitals
[29:59.000 --> 30:02.000]  and is sold over-the-counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[30:02.000 --> 30:07.000]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two years as a bit of a seller.
[30:07.000 --> 30:15.000]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there
[30:15.000 --> 30:22.000]  at a lower price with their patented silver salt technology in it.
[30:22.000 --> 30:29.000]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the steric acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil,
[30:29.000 --> 30:33.000]  it's got the nano-silver coconut oil and so much more.
[30:33.000 --> 30:38.000]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one.
[30:38.000 --> 30:40.000]  You're not going to find a product that's good anywhere.
[30:40.000 --> 30:46.000]  You're certainly not going to find it at this price and it funds the InfoWar at InfoWarsLife.com.
[30:46.000 --> 30:49.000]  Get your super silver skin cream today.
[30:49.000 --> 30:55.000]  We can only run this special for another week or so as I'm taping this September 10th.
[30:55.000 --> 30:59.000]  There are a few things in this universe that I'm sure to bet.
[30:59.000 --> 31:03.000]  But I'm here to tell you the products at InfoWarsLife.com are.
[31:03.000 --> 31:09.000]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested, best tested product.
[31:09.000 --> 31:16.000]  Best tested, most loved, most documented substances that God gave us through Mother Nature
[31:16.000 --> 31:20.000]  and then we make it even stronger, even better and lower the price.
[31:20.000 --> 31:24.000]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation,
[31:24.000 --> 31:27.000]  headaches, it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[31:27.000 --> 31:29.000]  It sells itself.
[31:29.000 --> 31:37.000]  But normal turmerics only has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant.
[31:37.000 --> 31:39.000]  Originally obviously from India.
[31:39.000 --> 31:45.000]  Well, body's ultimate turmeric formula has a 95% curcuminoid level
[31:45.000 --> 31:48.000]  and it's got other natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it
[31:48.000 --> 31:51.000]  and that's why people absolutely love it.
[31:51.000 --> 31:54.000]  I'm doing this all for people that haven't tried it yet.
[31:54.000 --> 31:58.000]  50% off on bodies at InfoWarsLife.com.
[31:58.000 --> 32:01.000]  Happys is a tincture that you take under the tongue.

[32:08.000 --> 32:10.000]  but not be a depressant.
[32:10.000 --> 32:13.000]  Now, despite the fact that I've never really promoted or cut an ad for it,

[32:24.000 --> 32:30.000]  But ashwagandha root, rhodiola root, passionflower herb, green tea leaf and licorice root
[32:30.000 --> 32:35.000]  is known to be so good for us and to smooth us out in a calm, good way.

[33:01.000 --> 33:09.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:09.000 --> 33:13.000]  Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.
[33:13.000 --> 33:18.000]  We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.
[33:18.000 --> 33:22.000]  You know, Australia is a good example, Canada is a good example,
[33:22.000 --> 33:24.000]  the UK is a good example.
[33:24.000 --> 33:25.000]  Why?
[33:25.000 --> 33:28.000]  Because each of them had mass killings.
[33:28.000 --> 33:34.000]  Somebody somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue.
[33:34.000 --> 33:37.000]  Well, this is something we should politicize.
[33:37.000 --> 33:38.000]  I'm not going to carry a gun.
[33:38.000 --> 33:40.000]  I don't want to be involved in a gun flight.
[33:40.000 --> 33:48.000]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban,
[33:48.000 --> 33:53.000]  picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[33:53.000 --> 34:01.000]  Go ahead, make my day.
[34:01.000 --> 34:05.000]  So the notion that gun laws don't work is not borne out by the evidence.
[34:05.000 --> 34:11.000]  He says that the Chicago police had a plan over this bloody 4th of July weekend.
[34:11.000 --> 34:20.000]  Nonetheless, as you indicated, Corey, there was a count of casualties that could have been from Afghanistan or Iraq.
[34:20.000 --> 34:24.000]  We'll make it harder for law abiding citizens and criminals.
[34:24.000 --> 34:25.000]  We'll still get their guns.
[34:25.000 --> 34:32.000]  In many cases, the offenders, felons, some out on parole, some out on bond.
[34:32.000 --> 34:39.000]  But we have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence.
[34:39.000 --> 34:48.000]  There are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[34:48.000 --> 34:50.000]  The average American does not have that.
[34:50.000 --> 34:56.000]  Mayor Bloomberg, why can you defend yourself but not the majority of Americans?
[34:56.000 --> 34:58.000]  I mean, look at the team of security you've got.
[34:58.000 --> 35:07.000]  Every day, every school at every level. One thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive about this.
[35:07.000 --> 35:14.000]  And we need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[35:14.000 --> 35:18.000]  Was this the weapon of choice for a new kind of terrorist?
[35:18.000 --> 35:26.000]  When a 5-year-old girl said she and a classmate should shoot each other with bubbles, the school called it a terrorist threat.
[35:26.000 --> 35:30.000]  AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[35:30.000 --> 35:35.000]  You know, the right to bear arms is because that's the last form of defense against tyranny.
[35:35.000 --> 35:38.000]  Lay down your arms, you damn rebels!
[35:38.000 --> 35:43.000]  But we don't need the ability to arm ourselves against the army or the police.
[35:43.000 --> 35:46.000]  What kind of a situation in the U.S. would you see that happening?
[35:46.000 --> 35:50.000]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[35:50.000 --> 35:56.000]  Cover, the clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem. Us.
[35:56.000 --> 36:04.000]  To say we're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not knocking down if you want a commentary code.
[36:04.000 --> 36:24.000]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[36:24.000 --> 36:34.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live broadcasting worldwide. I'm your host, Alex Jones. Paul Joseph Watson joins us.
[36:34.000 --> 36:37.000]  When I start the next hour, I'm going to get into how to stop this move to disarm the American people and complete our journey into slavery.
[36:37.000 --> 36:45.000]  And I'm going to get into the globalist larger plan to carry that out and what will happen if they're partially successful triggering a civil war.
[36:45.000 --> 36:48.000]  But there's a way to stop all this right now.
[36:48.000 --> 36:54.000]  And that's to go on a counter offensive and to expose the medications that admit they cause mass murder.
[36:54.000 --> 37:04.000]  And the media with the studies that admit they are spurring people who are mentally ill to commit these acts that are still very rare, but are up.
[37:04.000 --> 37:08.000]  Overall crime hit its height in 1991.
[37:08.000 --> 37:13.000]  It went down 61% violent crime with guns. Overall, that's FBI numbers.
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.000]  And then now crimes gone back up about 10% of that has has has gone away.
[37:17.000 --> 37:30.000]  So we're only at about 50% reduction, according to Professor lot of what we were of what we were previous to 1991.
[37:30.000 --> 37:35.000]  But in the 80s, that was the big crime wave. Everybody knows that and people went out and got guns to protect themselves.
[37:35.000 --> 37:40.000]  So the left really wants to sew this up. They want political power over everyone. It's a very critical time.
[37:40.000 --> 37:47.000]  But I want to get Paul Joseph Watson on about a particular article he wrote for summit dot news and info wars dot com.
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  We have a video clip we're going to get to as well next segment.
[37:49.000 --> 37:56.000]  And that is millennials being taught to have nothing and be poor and live in coffin size apartments.
[37:56.000 --> 38:01.000]  And this has gone from being promoted just a few years ago by Bloomberg and others to now being main line.
[38:01.000 --> 38:07.000]  But per square foot, it's a total ripoff. They charge you 10, 15 times what you would have gotten previously.
[38:07.000 --> 38:13.000]  They're teaching you to have less. They're teaching you have no free speech. You have no privacy. You're always being surveilled.
[38:13.000 --> 38:19.000]  So let's go ahead and go to Paul Joseph Watson from London England to give us his breakdown on this. Paul, thanks for joining us.
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.000]  Thanks Alex. Yeah, this was a feature put out by CNN.
[38:23.000 --> 38:27.000]  Very glowing review of this pod share company.
[38:27.000 --> 38:34.000]  Basically, if people watch the clip and I've just put up a video about it on YouTube is on info wars dot com.
[38:34.000 --> 38:40.000]  There's a quote from Hill Air Belock who is a writer and historian. He said, quote, if we do not restore the institution of property,
[38:40.000 --> 38:45.000]  we cannot escape restoring the institution of slavery. There is no third choice.
[38:45.000 --> 38:56.000]  Ownership and property Alex is freedom. But the fact is that millennials in the West cannot afford to buy homes anymore because their paychecks have remained stagnant.
[38:56.000 --> 39:03.000]  Meanwhile, with quantitative easing, vast money printing, inflation has gone through the roof to the point now in the UK,
[39:03.000 --> 39:12.000]  where people are renting out literal cupboards under the stairs with a single bed in it for the equivalent of $750 a month.
[39:12.000 --> 39:21.000]  OK, when I first bought a house back in 2003, when I was about 21, I was paying $200 a month mortgage.
[39:21.000 --> 39:27.000]  Now you can't even rent a cupboard under the stairs for less than 750.
[39:27.000 --> 39:36.000]  And it's because Alex, that obviously wages have remained stagnant in the in the U.S. home ownership is at its lowest in half a century.
[39:36.000 --> 39:45.000]  And it's mainly being driven by these broke millennials who are shelling out $1,200 a month in this case to live in the middle of San Francisco,
[39:45.000 --> 39:55.000]  this S whole city with needles all over the floor, junkies everywhere, huge homelessness problem, you know, poop on the streets every every 10 paces.
[39:55.000 --> 40:00.000]  And they've got no privacy. They're living in literal prison-style bunk beds.
[40:00.000 --> 40:05.000]  As you said, this is designed to atomize people to prevent them from having families.
[40:05.000 --> 40:15.000]  How on earth are you going to form any romantic relationship with anyone if you're literally cheek by jowl with five other people in prison-style bunk beds?
[40:15.000 --> 40:19.000]  And this is admitted that this is being put in as a post-human world.
[40:19.000 --> 40:27.000]  This was written all about the 60s. It was in the official plans. It's what China did in the Great Leap Forward Cultural Revolution that killed 115 million people
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.000]  is they took the 90% rural population and forced them into this.
[40:31.000 --> 40:39.000]  So this that's why David Rockefeller in 73 wrote an op-ed with Mao Zedong died praising it as the model for the world.
[40:39.000 --> 40:46.000]  Yeah, it was actually part of the agenda of why they built all these giant tower blocks specifically in Western Europe.
[40:46.000 --> 40:50.000]  Of course, they're everywhere in London. They've started to demolish some of them.
[40:50.000 --> 41:00.000]  But it was from the start designed by Corbusium, the French architect, to be this totalitarian idea of having all the worker bees stacked on top of each other,
[41:00.000 --> 41:07.000]  close together in the city, get them out of the rural areas, get them into the city where they can be easily controlled.
[41:07.000 --> 41:12.000]  This is the UN Sustainable Agenda 21 mission to do that.
[41:12.000 --> 41:22.000]  And it's coincided with a situation in cities like San Francisco where the middle class are fleeing because they can no longer afford a decent standard of living.
[41:22.000 --> 41:36.000]  But the illegals are still flooding in because just like in London, the illegals and even some of the legal immigrants will live 10 to a tiny apartment in London because their benchmark for standard of living is so low.
[41:36.000 --> 41:44.000]  So they'll earn enough money between them to live 10 to a tiny apartment and actually have disposable income to send back home to Romania or wherever they come from.
[41:44.000 --> 41:49.000]  Of course, the middle class are not happy with having that standard of living.
[41:49.000 --> 41:52.000]  So they're having to flee. They're having to go to other areas.
[41:52.000 --> 42:04.000]  And of course, out of California, a lot of them are going to Austin and turning Texas blue basically. So it has a political knock on effect as well.
[42:04.000 --> 42:11.000]  Paul, this is a concerted global model and it's being done to make us a post-industrial world to make life miserable.
[42:11.000 --> 42:19.000]  You've done your modern art pieces where you show mainline articles where the CIA run by leftist foundations in the 50s and 60s said we want ugly art.
[42:19.000 --> 42:24.000]  We want ugly homes. We want ugly government buildings. We want to oppress you. We want you to give up.
[42:24.000 --> 42:30.000]  And then now they're saying we want to kill babies after they're born and they are babies. We love killing them.
[42:30.000 --> 42:36.000]  I mean, this is a real true venomous evil attack by Hollywood and all of it.
[42:36.000 --> 42:45.000]  I want to talk about this more and where you think it's all going on the other side and why you think they're coming out of the open now from what was behind the scenes to externalizing the method.
[42:45.000 --> 42:48.000]  Paul Joseph Watson has an excellent site. You should check it out.
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.000]  Summit.News. Of course, he still works. That's a great job with infowars.com and newswars.com.

[43:01.000 --> 43:06.000]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[43:06.000 --> 43:13.000]  That new formula is ultra 12. It's twice as strong as secret 12. The very best vitamin B12 out there.

[43:35.000 --> 43:44.000]  Bottom line, folks, you need ultra 12. It helps fund the info war. So it's a 360 win and it's 50% off for a limited time at infowarstore.com.

[44:08.000 --> 44:13.000]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it. The last two years has been a best seller.
[44:13.000 --> 44:25.000]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented silver salt technology in it.
[44:25.000 --> 44:35.000]  It's got the hyaluronic acid. It's got the steric acid. It's got the grapefruit essential oil. It's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[44:35.000 --> 44:43.000]  It's in two sizes. Super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one. You're not going to find a product that's good anywhere.
[44:43.000 --> 44:49.000]  You're certainly not going to find it at this price and it funds the info war at infowarslive.com.
[44:49.000 --> 44:59.000]  Get your super silver skin cream today. We can only run this special for another week or so as I'm taping this September 10th.

[45:26.000 --> 45:37.000]  So many things. It sells itself. But normal turmeric only has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant.
[45:37.000 --> 45:51.000]  Originally obviously from India. Well, body's ultimate turmeric formula has a 95% curcuminoid level and it's got other natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it and that's why people absolutely love it.
[45:51.000 --> 45:58.000]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet. 50% off on bodies at infowarslive.com.
[46:22.000 --> 46:33.000]  15 years ago that Google was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do at hundreds and hundreds of other giant issues.
[46:33.000 --> 46:37.000]  Like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit, trying to control our economy.
[46:37.000 --> 46:43.000]  That our government in Hollywood have been taken over by the Communist Chinese on every one of these issues and many others.
[46:43.000 --> 46:47.000]  We've been dead on and we've raised the alarm on a planetary scale.
[46:47.000 --> 46:54.000]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down and that's why you are more critical than ever to support the info war.
[46:54.000 --> 47:18.000]  Please support the info war however you can.
[47:24.000 --> 47:42.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:42.000 --> 47:54.000]  We are back live. Paul Joseph Watson riding shotgun with us, great writer, researcher at Prison Planet still on Twitter and of course doing a great job at infowars.com, newswars.com.
[47:54.000 --> 48:00.000]  We're going to go back to Paul to finish up with the plan to vertically integrate the economy with big tech to make any other type of economy impossible.
[48:00.000 --> 48:12.000]  Once you are reliant on the system and once humans have been made redundant, they can then dictate the terms of our surrender for sterilization and then euthanization.
[48:12.000 --> 48:17.000]  And that is the globalist mop up plan, the post industrial world.
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  It is extremely serious.
[48:19.000 --> 48:31.000]  But they know that the West and the Renaissance and the Christian ethos could pump up the world and build a bridge and stabilize the third world so the West is in the process of being destroyed.
[48:31.000 --> 48:36.000]  Just like we're trying to destroy our free speech, our families, we're trying to destroy info wars right now.
[48:36.000 --> 48:45.000]  We're running some of the biggest specials in a long time on a large list of specific products that are already best sellers, ladies and gentlemen.

[49:30.000 --> 49:34.000]  I mean, if you want a long sustained 10 hour energy.

[51:04.000 --> 51:13.000]  So thank you all going back to Paul Joseph Watson now finishing up on this post human world they admit their building they really come out in the open about it.
[51:13.000 --> 51:18.000]  Talk about some more facets of it and then you were wanting to bring up this so called AI brain.
[51:18.000 --> 51:28.000]  If you think you're already depressed and distracted with your smartphone and your quote so called smart TV that's watching you will wait till you have this digital brain plugged in tell us about it.
[51:28.000 --> 51:39.000]  Yeah, I mean it all ties into this idea that the elite wants the underclass that doesn't get the cybernetic upgrade which they do which literally turns them into into a subspecies if they don't get it.
[51:39.000 --> 51:43.000]  Let's do that in a second finishing up on the on the pod people.
[51:43.000 --> 51:49.000]  Basically no one owns anything ownership is freedom but these millennials can't afford to own their own homes anymore.
[51:49.000 --> 51:58.000]  You know they come out of college thirty thousand dollars in student debt countries in twenty two trillion in debt everyone's in debt nobody can afford anything.
[51:58.000 --> 52:07.000]  And the other factor Alex is homelessness because they've got this pod share in Los Angeles has been a 75% increase in homelessness in Los Angeles since 2012.
[52:07.000 --> 52:17.000]  There's trash everywhere they're talking about the return of bubonic plague sixty thousand homeless people on the streets of Los Angeles 75% of them don't have access to shelters.
[52:17.000 --> 52:21.000]  And yet what are they doing with this inner city property.
[52:21.000 --> 52:26.000]  They're giving it over to these pod share people who are paying twelve hundred dollars a month for a pot.
[52:26.000 --> 52:34.000]  So it's exacerbating the homeless problem as well as ripping off these young people who can't afford to get anything better.
[52:34.000 --> 52:47.000]  But again it goes back to what we've talked about before which is the elite wanting to maintain their own hedonistic lifestyle of decadence by maintaining that steady import of mass immigration which also drives up house prices.
[52:47.000 --> 52:53.000]  You've got onerous property regulations building regulations in California that drives up house prices.
[52:53.000 --> 53:03.000]  But the other factor that came out last week which relates to this is so called servant class jobs jobs which cater to the needs of the elite.
[53:03.000 --> 53:08.000]  Mass use pedicure stuff like that massively outstrip normal job growth.
[53:08.000 --> 53:19.000]  So between 2008 2018 there was a seven percent growth in general jobs but a one hundred and fourteen percent increase in servant class jobs.
[53:19.000 --> 53:27.000]  So the illegals the immigrants are all coming into these mega cities the Silicon Valley elite are using them for that for their pedicures and manicures.
[53:27.000 --> 53:33.000]  Meanwhile they're all living tend to an apartment the middle class can't afford to move there so they all move out.
[53:33.000 --> 53:43.000]  So you have this dystopian two caste system where you've got this underclass who are just wage slaves for the elite and then the elite themselves with barely any middle class left.
[53:43.000 --> 53:48.000]  And that obviously Alex fundamentally destabilizes society if you have no middle class.
[53:48.000 --> 53:57.000]  Globalism the deals with China we were going to be a service economy good and clean for the earth. And now we're not even have fossil fuels Joe Biden the Democrats say.
[53:57.000 --> 54:02.000]  But China and India and Mexico and 160 plus other countries they can all have no environmental standards.
[54:02.000 --> 54:08.000]  But first they show little pods out in the countryside and you know many living and getting away from the big house.
[54:08.000 --> 54:11.000]  Well that's totally true that's healthy to be out in the woods.
[54:11.000 --> 54:19.000]  Then they cut in the piece to these new high rises owned by Bloomberg and others where they again charge you 10 times per square foot what you would.
[54:19.000 --> 54:32.000]  It's literally a prison communal bunk bed one toilet and you pay what you would have just a few years ago for a decent apartment all as a mind scam telling the trendy leftist this is cool to be slaves.
[54:32.000 --> 54:38.000]  So they've been maneuvered scammed by the colleges worthless degrees 90% of them now maneuvered into this.
[54:38.000 --> 54:44.000]  And again it's not just our opinion it's all a master plan I made in game 12 years ago.
[54:44.000 --> 54:50.000]  And I say you'll be in giant high rises and tiny coffin apartments that are two hundred fifty square feet.
[54:50.000 --> 54:54.000]  Well now they're not even giving you that you don't even have that you just have a bunk bed.
[54:54.000 --> 54:57.000]  Ladies and gentlemen this is all been planned.
[54:57.000 --> 55:03.000]  And again they're teaching you to have absolutely no freedom no privacy beyond 1984.
[55:03.000 --> 55:10.000]  Which is worse than how Winston Smith was living in George Arwell's vision of a Stalinist hell.
[55:10.000 --> 55:13.000]  At least Winston Smith had his own room right.
[55:13.000 --> 55:14.000]  I don't even get that.
[55:14.000 --> 55:20.000]  There's a black mirror episode which is like a sci-fi dystopian Netflix series probably heard of it.
[55:20.000 --> 55:27.000]  Where again all these people live in these pods they're all atomized none of them have families none of them have pets.
[55:27.000 --> 55:31.000]  They all go out and ride exercise bikes to power their own little society.
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  It's like an ant colony.
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  And that's exactly what they're creating.
[55:35.000 --> 55:41.000]  There was there was a debate in the Twitter thread about oh this is socialism and other people saying no it's capitalism.
[55:41.000 --> 55:44.000]  Basically the worst aspects of both Alex.
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  It's hyper capitalism.
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.000]  It's basically socialism for the rich.
[55:48.000 --> 55:52.000]  This is all anyone else can afford unless you're in the elite.
[55:52.000 --> 55:57.000]  Because as I said before especially after the financial crash they just kept on printing money.
[55:57.000 --> 56:01.000]  House prices rapidly inflated but wages didn't.
[56:01.000 --> 56:05.000]  I mean if you let's go further they also said they want to teach you to go to Whole Foods.
[56:05.000 --> 56:08.000]  It's all full of how to live poor how sexy how beautiful it is.
[56:08.000 --> 56:13.000]  They're teaching you to pay more for less in a post industrial world because they don't want us up at E.
[56:13.000 --> 56:23.000]  They want us to be used to being poor as a way to control us while the very people lecturing is fly around in jumbo jets and have yachts the size of aircraft carriers.
[56:23.000 --> 56:33.000]  Exactly they just they just want the millennials the hipsters to just be able to scrape by and again they have no savings so no incentives to start families.
[56:33.000 --> 56:35.000]  So we need to import more immigrants.
[56:35.000 --> 56:45.000]  And their only way they ever think they get ahead is if Bernie Sanders or Kamala Harris or Andrew Yang give them something free which of course they'll never get.
[56:45.000 --> 56:53.000]  Yeah and then you have the culture telling them that having babies is bad and evil but not for people in Africa they can still have nine kids that's fine.
[56:53.000 --> 56:54.000]  People have no savings no ownership.
[56:54.000 --> 57:04.000]  Look at the stats out of the UK in 1995 home ownership for young adults on middle income was 65% in 1995.
[57:04.000 --> 57:10.000]  Now it's 27% see how far that's fallen for young adults on middle incomes.
[57:10.000 --> 57:19.000]  Again mean house prices were 152% higher in 2016 than 1995 after adjusting for inflation.
[57:19.000 --> 57:21.000]  They've inflated the bubble.
[57:21.000 --> 57:22.000]  Nobody has any money.
[57:22.000 --> 57:23.000]  Nobody has any savings.
[57:23.000 --> 57:24.000]  Nobody has any family.
[57:24.000 --> 57:28.000]  Everyone's atomized in these pods living worthless unhappy lives.
[57:28.000 --> 57:29.000]  That's what they want.
[57:29.000 --> 57:30.000]  Wow.
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  Paul Watson telling it like it is.
[57:32.000 --> 57:33.000]  We want to explain something.
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  It's worse than we're telling you.
[57:35.000 --> 57:36.000]  OK.
[57:36.000 --> 57:37.000]  It would take 10 hours to tell you all this.
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  This is all we do is study this.
[57:39.000 --> 57:40.000]  OK.
[57:40.000 --> 57:47.000]  These people are building a hell for all of us and I am not submitting to it.
[57:47.000 --> 57:48.000]  Never.
[57:48.000 --> 57:49.000]  Never.
[57:49.000 --> 57:53.000]  As I sit here recording this on the eve of September 11th, 2019.
[57:53.000 --> 57:57.000]  And I look back to that tragic event 18 years ago.
[57:57.000 --> 58:03.000]  It makes me sick to my stomach to be vindicated and have the fire department of New York and
[58:03.000 --> 58:09.000]  major construction and engineering firms come out and confirm that bombs were in Tower One,
[58:09.000 --> 58:12.000]  Tower Two, and of course, Building Seven.
[58:12.000 --> 58:14.000]  It's just pancakes.
[58:14.000 --> 58:19.000]  And then FBI Director Robert Mueller helped cover the whole thing up with the Saudis and
[58:19.000 --> 58:26.000]  to know that there's a deep state group working within our government with radical Islam who
[58:26.000 --> 58:31.000]  are using the threat of Islamic terror to take our basic liberties and freedoms while empowering
[58:31.000 --> 58:34.000]  and funding radical Islam to take over the planet.
[58:34.000 --> 58:39.000]  Well, 18 years later, I'm here to tell you that the world is waiting to 9-11 and in full
[58:39.000 --> 58:43.000]  wars and our researchers and our guests and our whistleblowers have been vindicated yet
[58:43.000 --> 58:44.000]  again.
[58:44.000 --> 58:49.000]  That's why infowars.com is more important than ever.

[58:59.000 --> 59:00.000]  body but not be a depressant.

[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  Welcome back.
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  Paul Watson's our guest here.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  Paul, I've got an article right here.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  More studies out.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  Teams spend three hours a day on social media and makes them depressed.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  It makes adults depressed.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  Another article, though, don't worry.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  They've got a new computer that'll hook your brain to things so you can look at hundreds
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  of things at one time as if our attention spans aren't already short enough as if our
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  brains aren't fractured enough.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  All the studies show this is like a weapon system.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  Tell us about this new development.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  Yeah, there's a headline on Drudge.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  AI synthetic brains will allow humans to be in 500 places at once.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  This is the man behind Amazon's voice assessment, Igor Jabalikov, who believes intelligence,
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  artificial intelligence will become so advanced, we will be unable to distinguish between a
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  real or synthetic mind.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  Of course, the entire point, Alex, behind transhumanism, as Ray Kurzweil outlined in his
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  1999 book, The Age of Special Machines, is that the underclass will not get access to
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  this technology, at least not immediately.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  It will be very expensive.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  It will be the exclusive domain of the elite.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  And that's how they will further entrench this to caste society.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  Kurzweil, in his own book, and I think I'm going to probably republish this article,
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  which was written way back in 2013, the dark side of Ray Kurzweil's transhumanist utopia.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  He wrote in his book, quote, humans who do not utilize such implants, he's talking about
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  cyborg implants, are unable to meaningfully participate in dialogues with those who do.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  So he's literally talking about humanity separating into two species, one the cybernetic version,
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  one the underclass, two caste society, where those who don't have access to the technology,
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  or those who refuse to have chips implanted in their brain, basically, are going to be
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  castigated out of society, are going to be ostracized out of society.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  And he also, in fact, quoted the unibomber in his own book.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  He said, quote, due to improved techniques, the elite will have greater control over the
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  masses, and because human work will no longer be necessary, the masses will be superfluous,
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  a useless burden on the system.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  If the elite is ruthless, they may simply decide to exterminate the mass of humanity.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  Ted Kaczynski said that, but Kurzweil quoted him in his own book.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  So it was a semi endorsement of the reality of that situation.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  Now you have McDonald's buying the technology where they don't even need a human taking
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  your order at the drive-through, the technology can differentiate between hundreds of different
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  ways of saying things, different accents.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  So automations coming in, there are going to be no jobs.
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  Maybe Andrew Yang's $1,000 a month is going to keep people occupied for a while.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  But again, Alex, as you were talking about depression, if you don't have anything to do,
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  if you don't have a purpose in life, that just generates more depression.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  So this life of a 15-hour work week, the carrot that they're dangling in front of us,
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  is only going to create more misery, more depression, more deaths of despair,
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  which are already skyrocketing in America.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  That's right.
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  In the NBC article on screen, the first paragraph says that humans will be extinct by the end
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  of this generation, that the plan is we're all dead and how wonderful it is that will
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  vanish from the earth.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  This is their sick post-human world.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  Are we going to put up with this?
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  That's what I'm saying, Paul.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  Precisely.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  It's whether the technology is so advanced that the elite will be so much more dominant
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  with the brain-processing power of that cybernetic augmentation compared to the underclass who refused
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  to take it.
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  But the elite have said many times, the eventual goal is to literally upload their brains into
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  computers and live forever.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  And that's how they're going to dominate humanity forever.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  Meanwhile, us poor humans, flesh robots, just die and wither away.
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  So they literally want to do that.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  They've planned it for decades.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  And now, finally, the early signs of the technology is starting to emerge to do that.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  Now, let's be clear, Paul.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  It's going to be wire heads with stuff leaking out of their heads, wearing wigs, thinking
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  they're part of the cool clubs.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  It's a grand faloon.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  And the truth is, it's an enslavement system.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  And the whole thing is a giant fraud.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  These people are fools going down this road.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  They want to convince us that they control the future.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  So we just act.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  We ask to it.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  It's a giant con game.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  Paul Joseph Watson at Summit.News.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  Great job.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  We'll talk to you again very, very soon.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  We're following all the amazing work.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  Thank you.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  Thanks, Alex.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  We'll be back.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  Stay with us.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  I'll tell you what's coming right after the break.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  Super Silver Woon Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S. that has their
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two years.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  It's been a best seller.
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:18.000]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented silver
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  salt technology in it.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  It's got the hyaluronic acid.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  It's got the steric acid.
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  It's got the grapefruit essential oil.
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  It's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  You're not going to find a product that's good anywhere.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  You're certainly not going to find it at this price and it funds the InfoWar at infowarslife.com.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  Get your super silver skin cream today.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  We can only run this special for another week or so as I'm taping this September 10th.
[1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:08.000]  Lights out slaves.
[1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:09.000]  Turn your energy off.
[1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:11.000]  Don't have children.
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:12.000]  Abort them.
[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:13.000]  It's good for the earth.
[1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  Don't fly around on jet airplanes or have a fireplace.
[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:17.000]  It's bad for the earth.
[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:20.000]  Oh, don't listen to Leonardo DiCaprio and Prince Harry.
[1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  They're private jets.
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:22.000]  They're the elite.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  They're better than you.
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  And now Beto O'Rourke says, hell yes.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  We're going to take your guns away and if you resist, we're going to kill your ass.
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  In 2013, we put together this compilation of them coming for your guns when they were
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  denying it at the time, just starting to admit some of it.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  And now here we are, where we were in 1775 and they came to Lexington Concord to take
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  the guns.
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  Then we'll talk to Caitlin Bennett, who was on the ground last night in Houston for the
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  Democrats most egregious display of their war on America.
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  It was unbelievable.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  We'll be talking to her in just a moment.
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  Here is this report from the vault.
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:32.720]  It's a military mission in North St. Louis.
[1:07:32.720 --> 1:07:36.600]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town and don't be alarmed if you see those
[1:07:36.600 --> 1:07:39.680]  over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[1:07:39.680 --> 1:07:44.000]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  Guns will be taken.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  No one will be able to be armed.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  We will take all weapons.
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  Enough.
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  Enough.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  Enough.
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  Enough.
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:02.680]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[1:08:02.680 --> 1:08:07.000]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:11.120]  And as KSLA News 12 Jeff Carroll discovered, the clergy would help the government with
[1:08:11.120 --> 1:08:14.200]  potentially their biggest problem, us.
[1:08:14.200 --> 1:08:17.680]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong
[1:08:17.680 --> 1:08:21.200]  to their parents, or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to
[1:08:21.200 --> 1:08:22.200]  whole communities.
[1:08:22.200 --> 1:08:28.560]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that, somebody else made that happen.
[1:08:28.560 --> 1:08:33.480]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal
[1:08:33.480 --> 1:08:34.480]  Pediatrics.
[1:08:34.480 --> 1:08:39.720]  Black Hawk choppers, soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[1:08:39.720 --> 1:08:44.720]  Only armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[1:08:44.720 --> 1:08:56.720]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[1:08:56.720 --> 1:09:00.720]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[1:09:00.720 --> 1:09:01.720]  I am inside.
[1:09:01.720 --> 1:09:03.720]  I have two words for you.
[1:09:03.720 --> 1:09:10.720]  You will never see it coming.
[1:09:10.720 --> 1:09:15.000]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras, parents grabbing their children
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:19.320]  and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves
[1:09:19.320 --> 1:09:22.720]  face to face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[1:09:22.720 --> 1:09:25.560]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in and now they're coming
[1:09:25.560 --> 1:09:27.720]  in like they're trespassers punching and shoving people.
[1:09:27.720 --> 1:09:32.720]  We're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not knocking down.
[1:09:32.720 --> 1:09:35.720]  If you want a commentator.
[1:09:35.720 --> 1:09:38.720]  We are on the march.
[1:09:38.720 --> 1:09:41.720]  The Empire is on the run.
[1:09:41.720 --> 1:09:46.720]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:09:46.720 --> 1:09:49.720]  Revolution is my job.
[1:09:49.720 --> 1:09:52.720]  Do they stop too fast?
[1:09:52.720 --> 1:09:56.720]  And it's the world they wish they have to live.
[1:09:56.720 --> 1:09:59.720]  And all the hate they've put in their hearts.
[1:09:59.720 --> 1:10:06.720]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[1:10:06.720 --> 1:10:14.720]  This is the heart of 1776.
[1:10:14.720 --> 1:10:20.720]  And six and a half years later, the Democrats officially say they're going to prime from
[1:10:20.720 --> 1:10:22.720]  our cold dead hands.
[1:10:22.720 --> 1:10:26.720]  We can live like they do in South Side Chicago or in the worst areas of Baltimore, Maryland,
[1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:32.720]  or the worst areas of Washington, D.C. or the worst areas of Detroit.
[1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:40.720]  The crime rate was massively higher in the 1980s.
[1:10:40.720 --> 1:10:43.720]  As of about six years ago, it was down 61 percent.
[1:10:43.720 --> 1:10:45.720]  FBI's numbers pull them up.
[1:10:45.720 --> 1:10:47.720]  Now it's gone back up some now.
[1:10:47.720 --> 1:10:50.720]  A lot of home invasions, a lot of crime even in Texas.
[1:10:50.720 --> 1:10:55.720]  A lot of criminals getting their asses blown off.
[1:10:55.720 --> 1:10:58.720]  That's always in the back of the paper, doesn't even make the news.
[1:10:58.720 --> 1:11:02.720]  But when some crazy sees the news, hyping up mass shootings, all the studies show it.
[1:11:02.720 --> 1:11:08.720]  Just type in studies, conclusively find media coverage of mass shootings causing new ones.
[1:11:08.720 --> 1:11:10.720]  And they know exactly what they're doing.
[1:11:10.720 --> 1:11:13.720]  Caitlin Bennett's with us for a couple segments.
[1:11:13.720 --> 1:11:21.720]  And then we're going to get into a way to stop this, a way to defeat this.
[1:11:21.720 --> 1:11:25.720]  There is a way, but they're going to keep saying every time there's a mass shooting,
[1:11:25.720 --> 1:11:27.720]  it's an epidemic, which it's not.
[1:11:27.720 --> 1:11:29.720]  They're going to hype it and they're going to just keep saying,
[1:11:29.720 --> 1:11:30.720]  we've got to do something, we've got to do something.
[1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:31.720]  And they believe they're going to get the guns.
[1:11:31.720 --> 1:11:34.720]  And what they're going to trigger is a civil war, which is actually what they want,
[1:11:34.720 --> 1:11:36.720]  because they can't wreck the country.
[1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:38.720]  They can't get the guns fair and square.
[1:11:38.720 --> 1:11:41.720]  So they need a giant collapse to get it.
[1:11:41.720 --> 1:11:43.720]  They need to list gun owners as terrorists.
[1:11:43.720 --> 1:11:46.720]  That's why you see on the news, all gun owners are terrorists.
[1:11:46.720 --> 1:11:50.720]  The NRA members are terrorists, white men are terrorists.
[1:11:50.720 --> 1:11:52.720]  It's not black people pushing that idea.
[1:11:52.720 --> 1:11:55.720]  It's white leftists trying to cause a race war.
[1:11:55.720 --> 1:11:58.720]  This is right out of the weatherman plan.
[1:11:58.720 --> 1:12:01.720]  It's right out of Solowinsky.
[1:12:01.720 --> 1:12:02.720]  It's here.
[1:12:02.720 --> 1:12:05.720]  And so I want to get into the debates last night with Caitlin.
[1:12:05.720 --> 1:12:09.720]  But first, you're the Penn State gun girl three years ago, two years ago,
[1:12:09.720 --> 1:12:10.720]  become very famous since then.
[1:12:10.720 --> 1:12:13.720]  You're reporting from FullWars.com to your own great reporting as well.
[1:12:13.720 --> 1:12:15.720]  But I mean, they're really out in the open.
[1:12:15.720 --> 1:12:18.720]  Why do you think they're so naked about this now?
[1:12:18.720 --> 1:12:22.720]  And Jed Johnson says he believes they're finally going to ban our guns.
[1:12:22.720 --> 1:12:25.720]  They want to do it now with executive orders, they say.
[1:12:25.720 --> 1:12:28.720]  If they can get rid of Trump, I mean, these people mean business.
[1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:31.720]  Why do you think they're being so honest now?
[1:12:31.720 --> 1:12:36.720]  I think they're being so honest because we have a lot of angry leftists in this country
[1:12:36.720 --> 1:12:38.720]  that are really mad about Trump.
[1:12:38.720 --> 1:12:44.720]  So they're going to come out and they're going to try to be like that radical kind of opposite of Trump here.
[1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:49.720]  So they think that since Trump got elected because he's so honest and he's blunt,
[1:12:49.720 --> 1:12:51.720]  that now they're just going to be honest about it.
[1:12:51.720 --> 1:12:55.720]  And to be honest, the leftists want to ban guns.
[1:12:55.720 --> 1:13:00.720]  So if there's someone up there like Beto, if they're saying, we're going to come and take them,
[1:13:00.720 --> 1:13:02.720]  there's no question about it, we're going to do it.
[1:13:02.720 --> 1:13:05.720]  And then he gets a giant applause.
[1:13:05.720 --> 1:13:07.720]  Of course, that's what they're going to say.
[1:13:07.720 --> 1:13:10.720]  And I just want to know how he's going to do it.
[1:13:10.720 --> 1:13:11.720]  Is he going to come take him themselves?
[1:13:11.720 --> 1:13:13.720]  Is he going to send the police?
[1:13:13.720 --> 1:13:14.720]  Is it the FBI?
[1:13:14.720 --> 1:13:15.720]  Who's going to take them?
[1:13:15.720 --> 1:13:19.720]  Because there's a lot here to take.
[1:13:19.720 --> 1:13:20.720]  There is.
[1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:28.720]  And they've had national review come out and say that Drag Queen's storytime is a wonderful thing.
[1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:30.720]  Convicted pedophiles in many cases.
[1:13:30.720 --> 1:13:33.720]  But children now humping them with erections.
[1:13:33.720 --> 1:13:35.720]  Men's genitals out with glitter on it.
[1:13:35.720 --> 1:13:37.720]  I can't even show this on TV.
[1:13:37.720 --> 1:13:38.720]  Okay.
[1:13:38.720 --> 1:13:40.720]  This is adult television with children.
[1:13:40.720 --> 1:13:42.720]  They're saying pedophilia is good now.
[1:13:42.720 --> 1:13:44.720]  They're killing babies after they're born.
[1:13:44.720 --> 1:13:47.720]  They say, we're here to corrupt your children and groom them.
[1:13:47.720 --> 1:13:54.720]  And then the mothers bring them to men dressed as clowns saying, groom my five-year-old.
[1:13:54.720 --> 1:13:58.720]  I mean, this is just, it's like hell opened up.
[1:13:58.720 --> 1:14:06.720]  Well, something else that I encountered at the debate last night was this older man.
[1:14:06.720 --> 1:14:11.720]  He said that they're going to change the definition of communism so that they can present it in a more better way.
[1:14:11.720 --> 1:14:15.720]  Better way than what history has taught us that communism does.
[1:14:15.720 --> 1:14:17.720]  Straight up just told me his agenda.
[1:14:17.720 --> 1:14:20.720]  We're going to rewrite the history of what communism is.
[1:14:20.720 --> 1:14:21.720]  We're going to change the textbooks.
[1:14:21.720 --> 1:14:23.720]  We're going to change the definition.
[1:14:23.720 --> 1:14:33.720]  And then we're going to present it to people as if it was something that hasn't happened in the last, you know, however many years that they've tried to implement communism all around the world.
[1:14:33.720 --> 1:14:36.720]  So they have an agenda and they're being very honest about it.
[1:14:36.720 --> 1:14:39.720]  I think that's a good thing because they're being honest about it.
[1:14:39.720 --> 1:14:45.720]  So we can combat it head on and we don't have to guess what they're trying to do.
[1:14:45.720 --> 1:14:46.720]  That's right.
[1:14:46.720 --> 1:14:50.720]  Instead of eating around the corners and being deceptive, that hasn't worked.
[1:14:50.720 --> 1:15:00.720]  And so they're just bum rushing with everything they've got, thinking of the movie Overton Windows so far towards tyranny that will battle and claw some of it back, but they'll still get some of what they want.
[1:15:00.720 --> 1:15:03.720]  So they're trying to externalize the hierarchy.
[1:15:03.720 --> 1:15:07.720]  They're trying to normalize it, whether it's pedophilia or killing babies after they're born.
[1:15:07.720 --> 1:15:09.720]  I mean, it even shocks me.
[1:15:09.720 --> 1:15:15.720]  Just have you seen the compilation we put together of mainline TV saying, I love hurting little babies.
[1:15:15.720 --> 1:15:16.720]  I like to bully them.
[1:15:16.720 --> 1:15:18.720]  I like to kill my own children.
[1:15:18.720 --> 1:15:19.720]  Those little pieces of filth.
[1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:20.720]  I love it.
[1:15:20.720 --> 1:15:21.720]  I'm so selfish.
[1:15:21.720 --> 1:15:22.720]  I enjoy.
[1:15:22.720 --> 1:15:24.720]  And then they actually go and murder their babies and the women.
[1:15:24.720 --> 1:15:26.720]  I can't even play these clips.
[1:15:26.720 --> 1:15:27.720]  I love it.
[1:15:27.720 --> 1:15:28.720]  It feels so good.
[1:15:28.720 --> 1:15:30.720]  I mean, it's like, what the hell?
[1:15:30.720 --> 1:15:33.720]  And what it is is we haven't stood up to these people.
[1:15:33.720 --> 1:15:35.720]  So they're just running wild.
[1:15:35.720 --> 1:15:40.720]  Well, they're right back with Caitlyn Bennett to get into what she saw on the ground at the debate last night.
[1:15:40.720 --> 1:15:43.720]  The other debates has almost been no one on the ground there.
[1:15:43.720 --> 1:15:49.720]  Were there any supporters for these drooling leftist ring race that she saw in Houston?
[1:15:49.720 --> 1:15:53.720]  Caitlyn Bennett straight ahead on Alex Jones with infowars.com and newswars.com.
[1:15:53.720 --> 1:16:16.720]  And now band.videos.
[1:16:16.720 --> 1:16:25.720]  We are now at survivalistcamps.com.
[1:16:25.720 --> 1:16:31.720]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[1:16:31.720 --> 1:16:34.720]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[1:16:34.720 --> 1:16:40.720]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[1:16:40.720 --> 1:16:44.720]  Its former colony, the US, had to save the empire.
[1:16:44.720 --> 1:16:47.720]  Is there ever a vote? Who do we fight for?
[1:16:47.720 --> 1:17:15.720]  The state began with World War I, the United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[1:17:15.720 --> 1:17:22.720]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[1:17:22.720 --> 1:17:30.720]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[1:17:30.720 --> 1:17:56.720]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[1:17:56.720 --> 1:18:05.720]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[1:18:05.720 --> 1:18:10.720]  I was the first to warn of human-animal hybrids and organ harvesting.
[1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:17.720]  I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born for their organs to be harvested.
[1:18:17.720 --> 1:18:21.720]  I was the first to warn you along with Paul Watson at infowars.com.
[1:18:21.720 --> 1:18:26.720]  15 years ago that Google was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do.
[1:18:26.720 --> 1:18:31.720]  And hundreds and hundreds of other giant issues.
[1:18:31.720 --> 1:18:35.720]  Like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit, trying to control our economy.
[1:18:35.720 --> 1:18:41.720]  That our government in Hollywood have been taken over by the Communist Chinese on every one of these issues and many others.
[1:18:41.720 --> 1:18:45.720]  We've been dead on and we've raised the alarm on a planetary scale.
[1:18:45.720 --> 1:18:52.720]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down and that's why you are more critical than ever to support the info war.
[1:18:52.720 --> 1:18:55.720]  Please support the info war however you can.
[1:18:55.720 --> 1:18:59.720]  We sold secret 12 for four years and it was our number third best seller.
[1:18:59.720 --> 1:19:04.720]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[1:19:04.720 --> 1:19:06.720]  That new formula is ultra 12.
[1:19:06.720 --> 1:19:11.720]  It's twice as strong as secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[1:19:11.720 --> 1:19:16.720]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things.
[1:19:16.720 --> 1:19:18.720]  Supports healthy nerve and brain cells.
[1:19:18.720 --> 1:19:19.720]  Helps make DNA.
[1:19:19.720 --> 1:19:20.720]  Helps the body produce energy.
[1:19:20.720 --> 1:19:22.720]  Helps produce healthy blood cells.
[1:19:22.720 --> 1:19:25.720]  Essential for proper nervous system functioning goes on and on.
[1:19:25.720 --> 1:19:33.720]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems and low sperm count.
[1:19:33.720 --> 1:19:35.720]  Bottom line folks, you need ultra 12.
[1:19:35.720 --> 1:19:42.720]  It helps sum the info war towards the 360 win and it's 50% off for a limited time at infowarstore.com.
[1:19:42.720 --> 1:19:47.720]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last.
[1:19:47.720 --> 1:20:06.720]  Ultra 12, twice as powerful, half the price, 50% off right now at infowarslive.com.
[1:20:17.720 --> 1:20:26.720]  Live from the infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:26.720 --> 1:20:28.720]  I hate that total rork.
[1:20:28.720 --> 1:20:32.720]  By the way, articles on infowars.com.
[1:20:32.720 --> 1:20:34.720]  That total rork has come out.
[1:20:34.720 --> 1:20:36.720]  We'll cover it next segment.
[1:20:36.720 --> 1:20:42.720]  With a gun confiscation shirt that says, hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15s.
[1:20:42.720 --> 1:20:43.720]  Well, we're going to sell a shirt.
[1:20:43.720 --> 1:20:44.720]  We'll get in by next week.
[1:20:44.720 --> 1:20:46.720]  We're going to put up, you know, they don't have these yet.
[1:20:46.720 --> 1:20:52.720]  He's been making money off the stuff that happened there in South Texas as well.
[1:20:52.720 --> 1:20:54.720]  He sold shirts about that.
[1:20:54.720 --> 1:20:59.720]  We're going to put a shirt out that basically says, from our cold dead hands, Beto.
[1:20:59.720 --> 1:21:02.720]  We'll basically come and get it, Beto or Rork.
[1:21:02.720 --> 1:21:08.720]  Come and get it, Beto or Rork, because it's not going to be from our cold dead hands.
[1:21:08.720 --> 1:21:10.720]  It's going to be from somebody else's.
[1:21:10.720 --> 1:21:12.720]  We'll come up with one by the end of the show.
[1:21:12.720 --> 1:21:17.720]  Speaking of that, we have a lot of t-shirts that are really high quality,
[1:21:17.720 --> 1:21:22.720]  that have the really soft, nice fabric that costs us $10 to $13 a piece,
[1:21:22.720 --> 1:21:31.720]  that are sold at Dillard's and sold at Macy's and sold at places like Tyler's that's in Texas for $35.
[1:21:31.720 --> 1:21:36.720]  So you understand, like most people sell a $5 shirt for $19.95.
[1:21:36.720 --> 1:21:40.720]  They sell a $13 shirt for $35, $40.
[1:21:40.720 --> 1:21:47.720]  These shirts, the space shuttle shirt, the Betsy Ross Flag shirt has that really nice fabric.
[1:21:47.720 --> 1:21:52.720]  These are designer shirts for $19.95, but I'm making $7 on them.
[1:21:52.720 --> 1:21:55.720]  It's about promoting InfoWars, but get in there and buy them.
[1:21:55.720 --> 1:21:59.720]  Get the InfoWars Tankman shirt that shows all the big tech as tanks,
[1:21:59.720 --> 1:22:00.720]  but try to run over InfoWars.
[1:22:00.720 --> 1:22:01.720]  That's one of my favorites.
[1:22:01.720 --> 1:22:03.720]  There's so many there.
[1:22:03.720 --> 1:22:07.720]  Now, I haven't gotten into really what should have been our top story,
[1:22:07.720 --> 1:22:14.720]  but the sand they're coming to confiscate the guns is so huge that it had to be our top story.
[1:22:14.720 --> 1:22:18.720]  Then all the free stuff is big, but they are inditing Andrew McCabe.
[1:22:18.720 --> 1:22:21.720]  I want to explain stuff to folks.
[1:22:21.720 --> 1:22:31.720]  We'll do it after Caitlin leaves us, but this is so big that it actually makes me sort of have an anxiety attack.
[1:22:31.720 --> 1:22:38.720]  I don't have those except when my wife's having a baby or something and the head's stuck or something.
[1:22:38.720 --> 1:22:40.720]  I've got nerves.
[1:22:40.720 --> 1:22:48.720]  I may get hyper and jump around, but the level of the climate politically is so powerful right now.
[1:22:48.720 --> 1:22:49.720]  It's so important.
[1:22:49.720 --> 1:22:55.720]  Good and evil are both moving at the same time that if you're not getting chills, you're not dialed in.
[1:22:55.720 --> 1:22:58.720]  I know we've been up here talking about the world being crazy for a long time.
[1:22:58.720 --> 1:23:03.720]  There has been, but everything is doubling and it's intensity every month now.
[1:23:03.720 --> 1:23:05.720]  Whoa, I just got massive chills.
[1:23:05.720 --> 1:23:07.720]  Are you getting those?
[1:23:07.720 --> 1:23:09.720]  Let's try to go back to Caitlin Bennett.
[1:23:09.720 --> 1:23:15.720]  Her skype's been breaking up some, but she's been filing so many amazing reports.
[1:23:15.720 --> 1:23:18.720]  Caitlin, if you're still in Texas, you ought to come up here and be in studio with us.
[1:23:18.720 --> 1:23:20.720]  I'm going to do a special live show tomorrow.
[1:23:20.720 --> 1:23:21.720]  2 to 4 p.m.
[1:23:21.720 --> 1:23:22.720]  We may even go longer.
[1:23:22.720 --> 1:23:24.720]  It's going to be called the Info Wars Roundtable Show.
[1:23:24.720 --> 1:23:29.720]  We'll have guest hosts and callers from the show that I think are our best callers.
[1:23:29.720 --> 1:23:31.720]  We'll be adding to the list.
[1:23:31.720 --> 1:23:34.720]  I'll be hosting segments with us.
[1:23:34.720 --> 1:23:37.720]  And I'm also going to obviously do the Sunday show 4 to 6 p.m.
[1:23:37.720 --> 1:23:43.720]  I'm just redoubling everything I'm doing, but talk about what you saw on the ground with the Democrats last night.
[1:23:43.720 --> 1:23:50.720]  So when we got there, we were expecting a really big presence kind of like in Detroit, but it was so low energy.
[1:23:50.720 --> 1:23:52.720]  There was like no one there.
[1:23:52.720 --> 1:24:00.720]  It's almost as if campaign people for the candidates came out and handed out campaign signs for people to hold.
[1:24:00.720 --> 1:24:03.720]  There were the fewest number of supporters were for Tulsi.
[1:24:03.720 --> 1:24:08.720]  Of course, she wasn't up there, but the nicest people were the Tulsi supporters.
[1:24:08.720 --> 1:24:13.720]  There was a large crowd for Biden, a large crowd for Bernie.
[1:24:13.720 --> 1:24:15.720]  It was kind of all over the place.
[1:24:15.720 --> 1:24:17.720]  It wasn't organized very well.
[1:24:17.720 --> 1:24:25.720]  Like I said, each group was kind of in their own thing and there were maybe a dozen and a half of them for each supporter.
[1:24:25.720 --> 1:24:27.720]  It was really sad.
[1:24:27.720 --> 1:24:32.720]  It was so sad.
[1:24:32.720 --> 1:24:35.720]  Elaborate on that.
[1:24:35.720 --> 1:24:36.720]  Yeah.
[1:24:36.720 --> 1:24:46.720]  So when we got there, the Biden people were basically up front and there were a dozen and a half of them there.
[1:24:46.720 --> 1:24:48.720]  And then we went over to try to talk to them.
[1:24:48.720 --> 1:24:54.720]  And a lot of them kind of recognized me at first and I didn't want to speak, but they were mostly just chanting.
[1:24:54.720 --> 1:24:56.720]  So they would each have their own chant.
[1:24:56.720 --> 1:24:58.720]  So the Biden people will have their own chant.
[1:24:58.720 --> 1:25:00.720]  The Tulsi people have their own chant.
[1:25:00.720 --> 1:25:02.720]  And then the Bernie people had their own chant.
[1:25:02.720 --> 1:25:07.720]  It was really hard to follow along what they were chanting about, what was their main issue.
[1:25:07.720 --> 1:25:16.720]  And then it came the climate people and then it came the Mexican radical Brown Berets, I think they're called.
[1:25:16.720 --> 1:25:19.720]  They're in California, Texas, Arizona and Mexico.
[1:25:19.720 --> 1:25:21.720]  They're hardcore communists.
[1:25:21.720 --> 1:25:26.720]  Basically, they're like Hispanic KKK members that are communists.
[1:25:26.720 --> 1:25:28.720]  And it was so crazy.
[1:25:28.720 --> 1:25:38.720]  So I got in there and I asked them if I could speak because it felt so inspired by the message of defunding ICE and all this stuff.
[1:25:38.720 --> 1:25:44.720]  And so I asked to speak and they were going to hand me the microphone until someone goes, no, don't hand it to her.
[1:25:44.720 --> 1:25:46.720]  Let a black woman speak instead.
[1:25:46.720 --> 1:25:53.720]  And I was like, imagine if it were the other way around, the whole world would be burning right now.
[1:25:53.720 --> 1:26:03.720]  So I think these people are a tad racist and I'm really excited to expose it later on in the day.
[1:26:03.720 --> 1:26:06.720]  And then they got the police to remove me from public property.
[1:26:06.720 --> 1:26:09.720]  And we're going to have a whole video about the police.
[1:26:09.720 --> 1:26:11.720]  I was about to say, I can't wait to see this.
[1:26:11.720 --> 1:26:15.720]  I mean, the Brown Berets are just like the KKK.
[1:26:15.720 --> 1:26:16.720]  They're stupid.
[1:26:16.720 --> 1:26:17.720]  They're trashy.
[1:26:17.720 --> 1:26:19.720]  They always have one tooth.
[1:26:19.720 --> 1:26:23.720]  And because I've gone out and protested the KKK and they show up too.
[1:26:23.720 --> 1:26:24.720]  They show up too.
[1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:27.720]  And it's just like they hate white people.
[1:26:27.720 --> 1:26:31.720]  I mean, it's just unbelievable how crazy this is.
[1:26:31.720 --> 1:26:32.720]  I mean, they would.
[1:26:32.720 --> 1:26:39.720]  And then when I actually tried to interject at one point and they were talking about separating babies from their mothers at the border.
[1:26:39.720 --> 1:26:40.720]  I said, what about abortion?
[1:26:40.720 --> 1:26:44.720]  We're separating a million babies every year from their mother through abortion.
[1:26:44.720 --> 1:26:48.720]  And they say, shut up, a black woman's talking shut up.
[1:26:48.720 --> 1:26:52.720]  And then they look at the police and they're like, and there's the officer touching me without my consent.
[1:26:52.720 --> 1:26:54.720]  Also notice there's some Muslims.
[1:26:54.720 --> 1:26:56.720]  There's some Muslims in there with the coalition.
[1:26:56.720 --> 1:27:00.720]  You know, under Islam, they wouldn't even let those women out of the house and anything political or drive a car.
[1:27:00.720 --> 1:27:04.720]  Oh, but America, they're hanging out with the leftist.
[1:27:04.720 --> 1:27:05.720]  It was totally insane.
[1:27:05.720 --> 1:27:07.720]  There's so much that went on there.
[1:27:07.720 --> 1:27:17.720]  There was a small crowd, but I almost think smaller crowds are better because we're able to get in there and actually capture what individuals of these movements are thinking.
[1:27:17.720 --> 1:27:20.720]  And the crazy things that they that they endorse.
[1:27:20.720 --> 1:27:22.720]  They were chanting at the police like they always do.
[1:27:22.720 --> 1:27:30.720]  And then they went and told the police to remove me from public property, which I stood my ground and I told the police I wasn't going to do because I know my rights.
[1:27:30.720 --> 1:27:33.720]  And we're going to have a whole video going on about that.
[1:27:33.720 --> 1:27:38.720]  Well, Caitlin, the minute you've got these videos, we're going to post them to news wars.com and info wars.com.
[1:27:38.720 --> 1:27:40.720]  And please come on the war room today.
[1:27:40.720 --> 1:27:44.720]  Please come on firepower with Will Johnson, especially as soon as you get a cleaner Skype connection.
[1:27:44.720 --> 1:27:48.720]  You just do a superlative job team does your fiance does your camera guy man does.
[1:27:48.720 --> 1:27:49.720]  And we love you guys.
[1:27:49.720 --> 1:27:51.720]  So please come to Austin as soon as you want.
[1:27:51.720 --> 1:27:55.720]  We'll fly you here and having in studio if you're still in Texas, please come now.
[1:27:55.720 --> 1:27:59.720]  And again, come on firepower will Johnson and Tom Pappert.
[1:27:59.720 --> 1:28:06.720]  And I want you and others to start trying to a daily show or weekly show too as well because you're doing such an amazing job.
[1:28:06.720 --> 1:28:08.720]  Where else can people find the whole consortium?
[1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:17.720]  So you watch the website like drudges said everybody should do sort of you're still on Facebook, Twitter places, but more and more getting banned yourself.
[1:28:17.720 --> 1:28:19.720]  People need to go to your actual URL.
[1:28:19.720 --> 1:28:22.720]  Tell folks about that.
[1:28:22.720 --> 1:28:24.720]  Yes, so go to libertyhangout.org.
[1:28:24.720 --> 1:28:26.720]  And that is our website.
[1:28:26.720 --> 1:28:30.720]  And then we post all of our videos on Liberty Hangout YouTube channel.
[1:28:30.720 --> 1:28:32.720]  That's right. Libertyhangout.org.
[1:28:32.720 --> 1:28:33.720]  All right. Thank you so much.
[1:28:33.720 --> 1:28:34.720]  Caitlin can't wait.
[1:28:34.720 --> 1:28:36.720]  How long do those videos are out this evening?
[1:28:36.720 --> 1:28:38.720]  We're going to yep.
[1:28:38.720 --> 1:28:39.720]  That's right.
[1:28:39.720 --> 1:28:42.720]  We'll have those during the war room and during firepower tonight.
[1:28:42.720 --> 1:28:46.720]  Find all the channels, all the shows, everything at banned video.
[1:28:46.720 --> 1:28:48.720]  Band.video.
[1:28:48.720 --> 1:28:50.720]  Band.video. Please share that link.
[1:28:50.720 --> 1:29:17.720]  We'll be right back with the biggest live last night.
[1:29:20.720 --> 1:29:22.720]  We'll be right back with the next video.
[1:29:50.720 --> 1:30:19.720]  As I said here, recording this on the eve of September 11th, 2019, and I look back to that tragic event 18 years ago, makes me sick to my stomach to be vindicated and have the fire department of New York and major construction and engineering firms come out and confirm that bombs were in tower one, tower two.
[1:30:19.720 --> 1:30:20.720]  And of course, building seven.
[1:30:20.720 --> 1:30:22.720]  It's just pancakes.
[1:30:22.720 --> 1:30:42.720]  And then FBI Director Robert Mueller helped cover the whole thing up with the Saudis in the know that there's a deep state group working within our government with radical Islam who are using the threat of Islamic terror to take our basic liberties and freedoms while empowering and funding radical Islam to take over the planet.
[1:30:42.720 --> 1:30:52.720]  Well, 18 years later, I'm here to tell you that the world is awakened to 9 11 and info wars and our researchers and our guests, our whistleblowers have been vindicated yet again.
[1:30:52.720 --> 1:30:55.720]  That's why info wars.com is more important than ever.
[1:30:55.720 --> 1:31:06.720]  Super silver wound gel is a private label from the top company in the US that has their products and hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[1:31:06.720 --> 1:31:09.720]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it.
[1:31:09.720 --> 1:31:11.720]  The last two years has been a bestseller.
[1:31:11.720 --> 1:31:23.720]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented silver salt technology in it.
[1:31:23.720 --> 1:31:25.720]  It's got the hyaluronic acid.
[1:31:25.720 --> 1:31:27.720]  It's got the steric acid.
[1:31:27.720 --> 1:31:29.720]  It's got the grapefruit essential oil.
[1:31:29.720 --> 1:31:33.720]  It's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[1:31:33.720 --> 1:31:41.720]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one, you're not going to find a product that's good anywhere.
[1:31:41.720 --> 1:31:47.720]  You're certainly not going to find it at this price and it funds the info war at info wars life.com.
[1:31:47.720 --> 1:31:50.720]  Get your super silver skin cream today.
[1:31:50.720 --> 1:31:56.720]  We can only run this special for another week or so as I'm taping this September 10th.
[1:31:56.720 --> 1:32:03.720]  There are a few things in this universe that are assured of that, but I'm here to tell you the products that infowarslife.com are.
[1:32:03.720 --> 1:32:17.720]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested, most loved, most documented substances that God gave us through Mother Nature and then we make it even stronger, even better and lower the price.
[1:32:17.720 --> 1:32:24.720]  Now turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches, it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[1:32:24.720 --> 1:32:25.720]  It sells itself.
[1:32:25.720 --> 1:32:34.720]  But normal turmeric only has 3 to 5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant.
[1:32:34.720 --> 1:32:36.720]  Originally obviously from India.
[1:32:36.720 --> 1:32:48.720]  Well, body's ultimate turmeric formula has a 95% curcuminoid level that's got other natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it and that's why people absolutely love it.
[1:32:48.720 --> 1:32:51.720]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet.
[1:32:51.720 --> 1:32:58.720]  50% off on bodies at infowarslife.com.
[1:32:58.720 --> 1:33:06.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:06.720 --> 1:33:11.720]  Now, they think you're a goldfish.
[1:33:11.720 --> 1:33:14.720]  I've been betting on you my whole life.
[1:33:14.720 --> 1:33:15.720]  I believe in you.
[1:33:15.720 --> 1:33:19.720]  I don't think you're stupid.
[1:33:19.720 --> 1:33:28.720]  We're kicking these trainers asses politically and we're not backing down at her.
[1:33:28.720 --> 1:33:30.720]  I want to get these people.
[1:33:30.720 --> 1:33:31.720]  We're winning.
[1:33:31.720 --> 1:33:32.720]  I can feel the spirit rising.
[1:33:32.720 --> 1:33:33.720]  Can't you?
[1:33:33.720 --> 1:33:35.720]  We have broken their back.
[1:33:35.720 --> 1:33:37.720]  Yes, I can feel it.
[1:33:37.720 --> 1:33:41.720]  Let's go.
[1:33:41.720 --> 1:33:48.720]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[1:33:48.720 --> 1:33:52.720]  Come on.
[1:33:52.720 --> 1:33:54.720]  Vengeance is coming.
[1:33:54.720 --> 1:33:56.720]  Fire is coming.
[1:33:56.720 --> 1:34:22.720]  The real revolution against you is coming and you will burn in hell.
[1:34:22.720 --> 1:34:32.720]  Alright, let me just slow down here.
[1:34:32.720 --> 1:34:34.720]  I really should be opening the phones up as well.
[1:34:34.720 --> 1:34:36.720]  This is so historic to give you a chance to respond.
[1:34:36.720 --> 1:34:44.720]  In fact, I will.
[1:34:44.720 --> 1:34:47.720]  No one has ever been charged at the top of the FBI.
[1:34:47.720 --> 1:34:51.720]  It's been able to basically get away with whatever it wants since it was set up.
[1:34:51.720 --> 1:35:00.980]  Since it was set up in the 1920s, 1930s by Jagger Hoover, who was its director until
[1:35:00.980 --> 1:35:10.360]  the early 1970s, and obviously any central federal police power is going to tend to become
[1:35:10.360 --> 1:35:14.240]  draconian, authoritarian and oppressive.
[1:35:14.240 --> 1:35:26.800]  The German Gestapo, the Russian NKVD, the Roman Pretorian, the French federal police,
[1:35:26.800 --> 1:35:36.360]  the Italian federal police, MI5 in the UK, power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[1:35:36.360 --> 1:35:42.920]  Now the average FBI agent as federal agencies go around the world has been somewhat of not
[1:35:42.920 --> 1:35:45.680]  as corrupt compared to other countries.
[1:35:45.680 --> 1:35:47.000]  He didn't get corrupt as fast.
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:52.280]  I mean, Hoover did a lot of blackmail and going after communists and anarchists and you obviously
[1:35:52.280 --> 1:36:01.440]  had his problems, but it was not an anti-American institution from my research until the Clintons
[1:36:01.440 --> 1:36:07.280]  got in in the 90s and they put their people in and they are still in there today and they
[1:36:07.280 --> 1:36:10.680]  are bad news.
[1:36:10.680 --> 1:36:14.640]  Herbert Walker put a lot of bad ones in, so really it started with him, the real decline
[1:36:14.640 --> 1:36:23.240]  of the FBI because I don't want to just tear up American institutions for no reason.
[1:36:23.240 --> 1:36:24.400]  The globalists want to do that.
[1:36:24.400 --> 1:36:27.400]  They want to tear up the police so they can federalize and globalize them.
[1:36:27.400 --> 1:36:32.480]  That's what the demoralization and the attacks are there.
[1:36:32.480 --> 1:36:34.840]  But I want to explain something.
[1:36:34.840 --> 1:36:40.120]  The fact that the deputy attorney general did not listen to this administrative appeal
[1:36:40.120 --> 1:36:48.120]  means there has been an indictment brought forward, a recommendation to prosecute and
[1:36:48.120 --> 1:36:50.680]  that that's going to happen.
[1:36:50.680 --> 1:36:52.120]  We know the grand juries are open.
[1:36:52.120 --> 1:36:54.800]  That's not cute stuff that's nebulous.
[1:36:54.800 --> 1:36:58.760]  That was admitted a year ago that were grand juries open in Virginia and Maryland on Andrew
[1:36:58.760 --> 1:36:59.840]  McCabe.
[1:36:59.840 --> 1:37:07.240]  So, that's confirmed stuff and I told you then, I said, even before that came out that
[1:37:07.240 --> 1:37:09.400]  they are looking to indict him.
[1:37:09.400 --> 1:37:14.720]  Now, I got another clip coming up that I just grabbed off Fox News during the break that
[1:37:14.720 --> 1:37:15.880]  we're going to have next hour.
[1:37:15.880 --> 1:37:20.120]  Rob Doos dumping it out is going to put it out on him, Full Horse, where they're already
[1:37:20.120 --> 1:37:26.080]  maneuvering it and going, oh, he did it all himself to give his wife $600,000 and the fake
[1:37:26.080 --> 1:37:27.080]  dossier.
[1:37:27.080 --> 1:37:36.480]  So, McCabe is the fall guy, but so many crimes have been committed that they've got to at
[1:37:36.480 --> 1:37:37.480]  least burn somebody.
[1:37:37.480 --> 1:37:39.120]  Here's the deal.
[1:37:39.120 --> 1:37:42.240]  He said he's going to sing like a canary.
[1:37:42.240 --> 1:37:44.520]  So, this is real.
[1:37:44.520 --> 1:37:45.760]  This is happening.
[1:37:45.760 --> 1:37:46.760]  This is going on.
[1:37:46.760 --> 1:37:50.880]  It means Trump's moving into the state and it means we're in a whole other ball game.
[1:37:50.880 --> 1:37:52.720]  This has never happened to an FBI director.
[1:37:52.720 --> 1:37:57.120]  So, here's Barnes breaking it down yesterday with precision.
[1:37:57.120 --> 1:38:03.240]  Countdown, ladies and gentlemen, Andrew McCabe, the decision's been made to indict him.
[1:38:03.240 --> 1:38:04.240]  Exactly.
[1:38:04.240 --> 1:38:09.400]  The breaking news today is that Attorney, U.S. Attorney Jesse Liu has chosen and decided
[1:38:09.400 --> 1:38:14.160]  already, has made the referral and the referral has been approved and authorized to indict
[1:38:14.160 --> 1:38:20.120]  Andrew McCabe, the former director of the FBI, the former deputy director of the FBI,
[1:38:20.120 --> 1:38:25.120]  the key decision maker in the Clinton email case, the Clinton Foundation case, the orchestrator
[1:38:25.120 --> 1:38:28.960]  of the spy gate and coup attempts against the President of the United States for his
[1:38:28.960 --> 1:38:33.680]  false statements to the FBI, for his false statements to the Office of Inspector General,
[1:38:33.680 --> 1:38:38.040]  for his illicit leaks to the media, for his attempts to illicitly spy on the President
[1:38:38.040 --> 1:38:39.280]  of the United States.
[1:38:39.280 --> 1:38:43.120]  All of that is going to be the basis and the reason and the predicate for an indictment,
[1:38:43.120 --> 1:38:47.800]  the first ever indictment against an acting director of the FBI who had ever been in any
[1:38:47.800 --> 1:38:50.160]  high-ranking position in the FBI.
[1:38:50.160 --> 1:38:54.280]  It's an extraordinary case where the first deep-state indictment really since Mark Felt
[1:38:54.280 --> 1:38:59.480]  in the late 1970s who ran Cointel Pro and was known as Deep Throat, who secretly took
[1:38:59.480 --> 1:39:01.280]  out the Nixon administration.
[1:39:01.280 --> 1:39:05.840]  This is, that's how significant and consequential this indictment is, because the way the process
[1:39:05.840 --> 1:39:10.720]  works is there's a doctrine called the Delegation Doctrine, it's a constitutional process about
[1:39:10.720 --> 1:39:14.280]  who has the approval and who has the authority to indict.
[1:39:14.280 --> 1:39:18.120]  While a grand jury has an indictment, only a U.S. Attorney can bring that case to the
[1:39:18.120 --> 1:39:22.880]  grand jury for the purposes of an indictment, and the way that works is the U.S. if it's
[1:39:22.880 --> 1:39:27.400]  a particular kind of case, tax case has to go to a particular U.S. Attorney in charge
[1:39:27.400 --> 1:39:28.880]  of the tax division.
[1:39:28.880 --> 1:39:33.280]  If it's a certain kind of political case involving a high-ranking government official, then it
[1:39:33.280 --> 1:39:37.360]  has to be approved of by the Deputy Director, the Deputy U.S. Attorney.
[1:39:37.360 --> 1:39:41.560]  The number two in the United States Department of Justice, which is Jeffrey Rosen, today
[1:39:41.560 --> 1:39:43.480]  it's reported that he has approved it.
[1:39:43.480 --> 1:39:47.920]  That means the indictment is coming within days, within weeks, Andrew McCabe will be
[1:39:47.920 --> 1:39:51.760]  indicted by the Department of Justice for his crimes against the President of the United
[1:39:51.760 --> 1:39:53.480]  States and on behalf of the Clinton family.
[1:39:53.480 --> 1:39:57.480]  And against the voters of this country and our electoral system and our republic.
[1:39:57.480 --> 1:40:05.240]  And this aura of invincibility, of infallibility of the Clinton crime machine and the Obama
[1:40:05.240 --> 1:40:10.280]  crime machine will then evaporate and you'll start seeing many others turn state evidence
[1:40:10.280 --> 1:40:11.360]  very, very quickly.
[1:40:11.360 --> 1:40:15.280]  This is a giant moment for the republic.
[1:40:15.280 --> 1:40:21.520]  This is approaching the level of when the British sued for peace 240 years ago.
[1:40:21.520 --> 1:40:27.400]  This is so massive, ladies and gentlemen, and you're going to see major counter-strikes
[1:40:27.400 --> 1:40:28.400]  though.
[1:40:28.400 --> 1:40:31.360]  I suspect that they're ever going to try to kill Trump or ever try to stage a big terror
[1:40:31.360 --> 1:40:32.680]  attack or something.
[1:40:32.680 --> 1:40:35.240]  This is when the deep state is about to fire all barrels.
[1:40:35.240 --> 1:40:40.200]  Well, in fact, I would say that this message is partially that because apparently the source
[1:40:40.200 --> 1:40:43.160]  for this story coming out is McCabe himself.
[1:40:43.160 --> 1:40:47.480]  It's McCabe's legal team sending the message, by the way, I'm about to get targeted, I'm
[1:40:47.480 --> 1:40:48.880]  about to get hit.
[1:40:48.880 --> 1:40:53.720]  So the peculiar kind of timing, if I was McCabe's people, I wouldn't necessarily put this out
[1:40:53.720 --> 1:40:54.720]  to the public.
[1:40:54.720 --> 1:41:02.440]  Now, he did raise almost $700,000 for a legal defense fund earlier, so maybe he's planning
[1:41:02.440 --> 1:41:03.640]  on doing a fundraise.
[1:41:03.640 --> 1:41:04.640]  What about Arkansas?
[1:41:04.640 --> 1:41:07.080]  What about his family getting live insurance on him?
[1:41:07.080 --> 1:41:12.440]  I mean, I think this guy has much longevity and a shelf life of Jeffrey Epstein.
[1:41:12.440 --> 1:41:13.960]  Well, there's two things about McCabe.
[1:41:13.960 --> 1:41:18.960]  He is made clear to everybody for a long time that he'll rat out anybody and everybody to
[1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:20.600]  save his own hide.
[1:41:20.600 --> 1:41:21.600]  That's number one.
[1:41:21.600 --> 1:41:26.640]  Number two, he's the source of letting everybody know, hey, by the way, he's about to get indicted.
[1:41:26.640 --> 1:41:30.120]  So that's a very sort of peculiar thing to do if you want to protect yourself.
[1:41:30.120 --> 1:41:34.720]  The third aspect with him is that if you're an insurance company, would you give life
[1:41:34.720 --> 1:41:38.880]  insurance right now to Andrew McCabe without some special exceptions for unusual and unexplained
[1:41:38.880 --> 1:41:39.880]  deaths?
[1:41:39.880 --> 1:41:40.880]  Kayak accidents?
[1:41:40.880 --> 1:41:41.880]  Yeah.
[1:41:41.880 --> 1:41:42.880]  Say, look, we will insure you.
[1:41:42.880 --> 1:41:43.880]  Heart attacks.
[1:41:43.880 --> 1:41:47.320]  We will insure you as long as your death can be fully and completely explained.
[1:41:47.320 --> 1:41:50.120]  But any unexplained deaths, sorry, no insurance for that.
[1:41:50.120 --> 1:41:52.680]  No sudden, you know, weird ways of-
[1:41:52.680 --> 1:41:53.680]  Car wrecks.
[1:41:53.680 --> 1:41:54.760]  Yeah, no car wrecks.
[1:41:54.760 --> 1:41:55.760]  No weird way.
[1:41:55.760 --> 1:41:56.760]  No sudden, unexplained, heart attacks.
[1:41:56.760 --> 1:41:57.760]  No falling downstairs.
[1:41:57.760 --> 1:41:58.760]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:41:58.760 --> 1:41:59.760]  None of that.
[1:41:59.760 --> 1:42:05.320]  No committing suicide while you're temporarily in federal custody under a video camera.
[1:42:05.320 --> 1:42:06.320]  Nothing like that.
[1:42:06.320 --> 1:42:08.080]  So it will be interesting to see.
[1:42:08.080 --> 1:42:11.560]  Now, he does have intel and information literally on everybody.
[1:42:11.560 --> 1:42:14.800]  I mean, if you wanted to talk about a deep state hatchet man with all the information
[1:42:14.800 --> 1:42:16.720]  and intel, it is Andrew McCabe.
[1:42:16.720 --> 1:42:18.960]  Covered up with the Clintons, the Foundation.
[1:42:18.960 --> 1:42:19.960]  He ran-
[1:42:19.960 --> 1:42:20.960]  He ran the emails.
[1:42:20.960 --> 1:42:21.960]  Ran the counter espionage unit.
[1:42:21.960 --> 1:42:24.440]  So, I mean, you're talking about a guy who knows everything about Peter Strozik, knows
[1:42:24.440 --> 1:42:26.960]  everything about everybody and everyone in the country.
[1:42:26.960 --> 1:42:27.960]  And that accident-
[1:42:27.960 --> 1:42:32.960]  I suppose we're gonna break that 15 minutes, that's only five minutes of it, stop on infowars.com.
[1:42:32.960 --> 1:42:35.600]  It's powerful and it's dead on.
[1:42:35.600 --> 1:42:36.920]  That means the indictment's coming.
[1:42:36.920 --> 1:42:41.080]  It's gone up, hoping that the number two, that's his job to kill it if he was, didn't
[1:42:41.080 --> 1:42:42.080]  kill it.
[1:42:42.080 --> 1:42:43.080]  Because Rosenstein's out.
[1:42:43.080 --> 1:42:45.000]  Rosenstein used to have that position.
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  It's on.
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:47.160]  Trump's moving against him.
[1:42:47.160 --> 1:42:48.160]  It's happening.
[1:42:48.160 --> 1:42:49.160]  Thank you, Jesus.
[1:42:49.160 --> 1:42:56.160]  We'll be right back on the other side, infowars, never surrenders.
[1:42:56.160 --> 1:43:01.920]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental
[1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:04.720]  blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[1:43:04.720 --> 1:43:09.400]  I was the first to warn of human animal hybrids and organ harvesting.
[1:43:09.400 --> 1:43:14.200]  I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born
[1:43:14.200 --> 1:43:16.760]  for their organs to be harvested.
[1:43:16.760 --> 1:43:21.880]  I was the first to warn you, along with Paul Watson and infowars.com, 15 years ago that
[1:43:21.880 --> 1:43:27.120]  Google was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do, and hundreds
[1:43:27.120 --> 1:43:30.920]  and hundreds of other giant issues.
[1:43:30.920 --> 1:43:35.360]  Like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit, trying to control our economy,
[1:43:35.360 --> 1:43:39.640]  our government in Hollywood have been taken over by the Communist Chinese on every one
[1:43:39.640 --> 1:43:41.600]  of these issues and many others.
[1:43:41.600 --> 1:43:45.560]  We've been dead on, and we've raised the alarm on a planetary scale.
[1:43:45.560 --> 1:43:50.320]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down, and that's why you are more critical
[1:43:50.320 --> 1:43:52.360]  than ever to support the info war.
[1:43:52.360 --> 1:43:55.760]  Please support the info war however you can.

[1:44:54.040 --> 1:45:00.680]  We sold Secret 12 for four years, and it was our number third best seller.
[1:45:00.680 --> 1:45:05.560]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[1:45:05.560 --> 1:45:07.720]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[1:45:07.720 --> 1:45:12.120]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[1:45:12.120 --> 1:45:17.480]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it, and it does amazing things.
[1:45:17.480 --> 1:45:21.760]  Supports healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, helps the body produce energy, helps
[1:45:21.760 --> 1:45:25.520]  reduce healthy blood cells, essential for proper nervous system function, it goes on
[1:45:25.520 --> 1:45:26.520]  and on.
[1:45:26.520 --> 1:45:30.400]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that could cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation,
[1:45:30.400 --> 1:45:34.360]  weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[1:45:34.360 --> 1:45:36.760]  Bottom line folks, you need Ultra 12.
[1:45:36.760 --> 1:45:42.560]  It helps fund the info war, so it's a 360 win, and it's 50% off for a limited time at infowarstore.com.
[1:45:42.560 --> 1:45:49.120]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last.

[1:45:57.320 --> 1:46:03.120]  Super Silver Woon Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S. that has their
[1:46:03.120 --> 1:46:07.560]  products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[1:46:07.560 --> 1:46:10.640]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two
[1:46:10.640 --> 1:46:11.640]  years.
[1:46:11.640 --> 1:46:12.640]  It's been a best seller.
[1:46:12.640 --> 1:46:18.080]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top
[1:46:18.080 --> 1:46:22.960]  skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented silver salt
[1:46:22.960 --> 1:46:24.440]  technology in it.
[1:46:24.440 --> 1:46:29.780]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the steric acid, it's got the grapefruit essential
[1:46:29.780 --> 1:46:34.080]  oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[1:46:34.080 --> 1:46:39.640]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one, you're
[1:46:39.640 --> 1:46:42.760]  not going to find a product that's good anywhere and you're certainly not going to find it
[1:46:42.760 --> 1:46:47.680]  at this price and it funds the info war at infowarslive.com.
[1:46:47.680 --> 1:46:52.480]  With your super silver skin cream today, we can only run this special for another week
[1:46:52.480 --> 1:46:59.320]  or so as I'm taping this September 10th.
[1:46:59.320 --> 1:47:09.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:09.960 --> 1:47:15.040]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[1:47:15.040 --> 1:47:18.640]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:47:18.640 --> 1:47:22.960]  I'm coming in tomorrow to do a new show that's going to be on TV satellite.
[1:47:22.960 --> 1:47:27.240]  We'll put that on radio satellite as well, but it's just going to have breaks at the
[1:47:27.240 --> 1:47:29.240]  start in the middle of the hour.
[1:47:29.240 --> 1:47:34.720]  The show will have like eight minutes of ads instead of 14 minutes of ads or whatever
[1:47:34.720 --> 1:47:38.680]  and it's going to be the info wars round table show that's going to be color based and once
[1:47:38.680 --> 1:47:42.800]  we kind of have the training wheels off, you'll still have someone to hear that helps quarterback
[1:47:42.800 --> 1:47:46.240]  stuff, you'll have the callers, some of the best callers over the years, we've been getting
[1:47:46.240 --> 1:47:47.240]  their numbers info.
[1:47:47.240 --> 1:47:52.080]  I had this idea like five years ago, never implemented it post the show and then I may
[1:47:52.080 --> 1:47:55.280]  even go a few more hours and just open the phones up to everybody to talk about all the
[1:47:55.280 --> 1:47:59.680]  stuff that's happening because usually when history takes place, people don't recognize
[1:47:59.680 --> 1:48:07.040]  it and later they say, wow, we didn't realize the amazing time that we were all living in.
[1:48:07.040 --> 1:48:10.000]  But again, everybody just kept saying, oh, the indictments aren't going to happen.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:11.200]  Oh, it isn't going to happen.
[1:48:11.200 --> 1:48:16.240]  And when we came on air yesterday and said, no, no, this is the procedure, they appeal
[1:48:16.240 --> 1:48:21.400]  it administratively up inside the government to where they're going to prosecute their
[1:48:21.400 --> 1:48:23.200]  own people.
[1:48:23.200 --> 1:48:24.560]  It's very incestuous.
[1:48:24.560 --> 1:48:25.560]  It's corrupt.
[1:48:25.560 --> 1:48:26.560]  I don't like it.
[1:48:26.560 --> 1:48:29.480]  Rosenstein was protecting all these criminals.
[1:48:29.480 --> 1:48:30.480]  He's out.
[1:48:30.480 --> 1:48:33.880]  Now there's the new deputy attorney general, Rosen.
[1:48:33.880 --> 1:48:39.200]  And they said, no, we're not going to say don't prosecute.
[1:48:39.200 --> 1:48:40.680]  So that means it's happening.
[1:48:40.680 --> 1:48:42.400]  Scott Barnes is a big criminal lawyer.
[1:48:42.400 --> 1:48:46.640]  What he used to do before he did First Amendment and all that, I mean, he's a famous criminal
[1:48:46.640 --> 1:48:49.560]  lawyer, very high success rate.
[1:48:49.560 --> 1:48:53.080]  I mean, I wouldn't put him in a racehorse, Haines level, because no one else was in a
[1:48:53.080 --> 1:48:54.480]  racehorse, Haines level.
[1:48:54.480 --> 1:48:55.480]  He's right there.
[1:48:55.480 --> 1:48:56.480]  Okay.
[1:48:56.480 --> 1:49:01.080]  And I mean, he knows all the procedures, okay.
[1:49:01.080 --> 1:49:06.480]  It's happening unless they change procedures, which has never been done.
[1:49:06.480 --> 1:49:08.080]  And sure enough, it's on Fox News.
[1:49:08.080 --> 1:49:10.640]  He's being indicted now.
[1:49:10.640 --> 1:49:14.240]  So all hell is going to break loose now.
[1:49:14.240 --> 1:49:18.240]  I've been telling you since the last hour that I'm going to get to their big plan and
[1:49:18.240 --> 1:49:20.240]  how to stop them on the gun grab.
[1:49:20.240 --> 1:49:21.240]  You need to understand.
[1:49:21.240 --> 1:49:28.360]  I know you know this, but for folks that don't, we need to tell them that they're losing
[1:49:28.360 --> 1:49:30.400]  so they want to start a civil war.
[1:49:30.400 --> 1:49:33.400]  They're going to have leftist jurisdictions come and start taking the guns and killing
[1:49:33.400 --> 1:49:34.400]  people.
[1:49:34.400 --> 1:49:36.800]  They're already killing folks all over with red flag laws.
[1:49:36.800 --> 1:49:41.520]  They've got leftist police departments that are on the dole ready to do this.
[1:49:41.520 --> 1:49:43.880]  They've caught police departments working with Antifa as well.
[1:49:43.880 --> 1:49:44.880]  That's been in the documents.
[1:49:44.880 --> 1:49:47.480]  I'm not saying the police on average are bad.
[1:49:47.480 --> 1:49:50.480]  They're some of the best people I've found on average because they're actually living
[1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:55.720]  in the real world and are informed compared to, you know, one-fifth of Americans who study
[1:49:55.720 --> 1:49:58.840]  don't even know one branch of the government.
[1:49:58.840 --> 1:50:01.200]  Don't you want to bet those are Democrats?
[1:50:01.200 --> 1:50:04.960]  But they're not going to give up, okay.
[1:50:04.960 --> 1:50:09.160]  So I don't even have anxiety anymore.
[1:50:09.160 --> 1:50:13.560]  I don't even have like the feeling like I've got to work harder to fight these people.
[1:50:13.560 --> 1:50:16.480]  I'm getting tingles all over me right now.
[1:50:16.480 --> 1:50:21.560]  I mean, I'm ready to kick some ass and I'm not saying I'm going to go out and do anything.
[1:50:21.560 --> 1:50:22.560]  Violent.
[1:50:22.560 --> 1:50:27.440]  I'm saying my body physiologically, intellectually has looked at all this and a spiritual level
[1:50:27.440 --> 1:50:33.800]  can feel it and my body is just like, I mean, I mean, it's like on fire than I am.
[1:50:33.800 --> 1:50:37.680]  It's not fire, it's like a chill, you know what I'm talking about.
[1:50:37.680 --> 1:50:41.760]  And that's because we're in the flux.
[1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:43.000]  We're in the warp.
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:44.880]  We're in the crossroad right now.
[1:50:44.880 --> 1:50:46.880]  We're in the destiny decision.
[1:50:46.880 --> 1:50:53.400]  We're at the moment of truth, like that moment you ask out the woman who ends up being your
[1:50:53.400 --> 1:50:57.720]  wife and you live with her forever and lover and have five kids with her, you know, it's
[1:50:57.720 --> 1:51:02.920]  you know that magic moment, but it could go either way, hell one way and a good future
[1:51:02.920 --> 1:51:03.920]  the other.
[1:51:03.920 --> 1:51:08.480]  Now I'm going to stop right there before I play these new clips from Fox News on this
[1:51:08.480 --> 1:51:13.840]  with a great idea that one of my former security guys really smart fellow went back to Florida
[1:51:13.840 --> 1:51:18.240]  to take care of his family came up with because I told my whole crew this morning came in
[1:51:18.240 --> 1:51:26.960]  and I said, I want the t-shirt to rebuke Beto Aurora and I went to my graphics people and
[1:51:26.960 --> 1:51:27.960]  I said, come up with something.
[1:51:27.960 --> 1:51:28.960]  They said, well, what do you think?
[1:51:28.960 --> 1:51:33.360]  I said, I can't come up with anything from our cold dead hands Beto or, you know, come
[1:51:33.360 --> 1:51:38.560]  and take it scumbag Beto, but I was so frustrated.
[1:51:38.560 --> 1:51:44.200]  And then my buddy 30 minutes ago, Dr. McCam shop, please sends me this and says, you need
[1:51:44.200 --> 1:51:45.200]  to put this shirt out.
[1:51:45.200 --> 1:51:46.680]  I just came up with the idea.
[1:51:46.680 --> 1:51:49.200]  It's got the Texas star or the Army star.
[1:51:49.200 --> 1:51:56.560]  It's got a, um, you know, M four, but they want to pay an AR 15 Beto not better not.
[1:51:56.560 --> 1:52:02.280]  That is the shirt and pipe hitters union owned by a bunch of Patriot veterans right here
[1:52:02.280 --> 1:52:03.280]  in Texas.
[1:52:03.280 --> 1:52:10.120]  Can't beat that made in Texas, printed in Texas, unlike that scallywag Beto.
[1:52:10.120 --> 1:52:12.800]  And they can, they're printing these right now.
[1:52:12.800 --> 1:52:14.520]  I just said, boom, you got a deal.
[1:52:14.520 --> 1:52:15.960]  They're printing them right now.
[1:52:15.960 --> 1:52:24.840]  It's going up in the next 30 minutes to m4store.com and the purchase funds this operation and
[1:52:24.840 --> 1:52:31.000]  the veteran that came up with the idea, my buddy gets 50 cents a shirt to help him out.
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:36.640]  And so this is very, very, very, very, very exciting.
[1:52:36.640 --> 1:52:40.160]  This is very, very exciting.
[1:52:40.160 --> 1:52:41.160]  So this is the shirt.
[1:52:41.160 --> 1:52:42.160]  It is the shirt.
[1:52:42.160 --> 1:52:47.040]  When he told me this is the shirt, I know he's not a BS or he's a smart guy.
[1:52:47.040 --> 1:52:52.680]  And there it is Beto, not if you're a radio listener, it's not up on m4store.com.
[1:52:52.680 --> 1:52:58.640]  The shirt literally will start printing today.
[1:52:58.640 --> 1:53:01.600]  I will have these by Tuesday.
[1:53:01.600 --> 1:53:06.040]  It's a limited edition shirt that makes it more fun.
[1:53:06.040 --> 1:53:13.160]  And it will fund our operation Beto, not it's a light gray shirt with the Texas little star
[1:53:13.160 --> 1:53:24.560]  or the Army star for both ubiquitous, the m4, Beto not designed by a veteran.
[1:53:24.560 --> 1:53:28.960]  And that's the perfect counter printed right here in Texas.
[1:53:28.960 --> 1:53:34.600]  We're going to make it 1995 to move these babies, even though the shirt has good fabric,
[1:53:34.600 --> 1:53:37.920]  so it costs more than, you know, I think they're giving me a deal.
[1:53:37.920 --> 1:53:39.960]  Let me get the shirt for like eight bucks or whatever.
[1:53:39.960 --> 1:53:47.040]  The point is, is that this fabric is expensive, Beto, not get it m4store.com and turn their
[1:53:47.040 --> 1:53:48.840]  hate of the Second Amendment into resistance.
[1:53:48.840 --> 1:53:50.040]  You've got to wear this.
[1:53:50.040 --> 1:53:51.200]  You've got to get this.
[1:53:51.200 --> 1:53:52.200]  You've got to fund this.
[1:53:52.200 --> 1:53:53.760]  They're trying to shut us down.
[1:53:53.760 --> 1:53:58.600]  We've got a bunch of supplements on sale that are our best sellers.
[1:53:58.600 --> 1:54:02.800]  We have 50% off Hapies, 50% off Chillforce, 50% off Rainforest Plus when bought with
[1:54:02.800 --> 1:54:06.600]  Chillforce, Total Gut Fusion Combo Pack 75% off.
[1:54:06.600 --> 1:54:08.120]  You've got to look into that.
[1:54:08.120 --> 1:54:14.120]  Number 12 is the best seller now, 50% off Myco ZX, the next level probiotics, and I've
[1:54:14.120 --> 1:54:15.560]  got the yeast, the candida, the mold.
[1:54:15.560 --> 1:54:16.560]  That's so important.
[1:54:16.560 --> 1:54:17.560]  It's 1995.
[1:54:17.560 --> 1:54:18.960]  That's that's what it costs us to make, folks.
[1:54:18.960 --> 1:54:21.360]  I'm moving all this out.
[1:54:21.360 --> 1:54:23.520]  Eight pack power stacks, 67% off.
[1:54:23.520 --> 1:54:26.920]  Never done a deal that good because everything's got to move to fund this and buy more product
[1:54:26.920 --> 1:54:27.920]  for next year.
[1:54:27.920 --> 1:54:30.880]  60% off liver and kidney care, Icaron, amazing.
[1:54:30.880 --> 1:54:31.880]  You owe it to yourself.
[1:54:31.880 --> 1:54:33.880]  These are things you need m4store.com.
[1:54:33.880 --> 1:54:34.880]  Okay.
[1:54:34.880 --> 1:54:37.200]  I'm going to stop right there.
[1:54:37.200 --> 1:54:43.400]  Let's get to Catherine Harrington on the attempts of McCabe legal team to prevent indictment.
[1:54:43.400 --> 1:54:44.400]  Here it is.
[1:54:44.400 --> 1:54:49.440]  Andrew McCabe is one step closer to criminal prosecution after a source close to his legal
[1:54:49.440 --> 1:54:54.400]  team confirmed to Fox News that the Justice Department had rejected this last minute appeal
[1:54:54.400 --> 1:54:59.280]  and this morning we've confirmed his legal team made three separate attempts to shut
[1:54:59.280 --> 1:55:00.280]  down charges.
[1:55:00.280 --> 1:55:05.080]  McCabe's team recently met with the U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C. Jesse Liu and
[1:55:05.080 --> 1:55:09.600]  made a personal appeal for her office not to move forward with prosecution.
[1:55:09.600 --> 1:55:14.200]  Then they met with Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen to make the same argument.
[1:55:14.200 --> 1:55:19.120]  Then McCabe's team sent a quote extensive letter to Rosen laying out their legal arguments
[1:55:19.120 --> 1:55:22.400]  and it was still rejected by the Deputy Attorney General.
[1:55:22.400 --> 1:55:28.160]  The U.S. Attorney is recommending charges against McCabe based on the findings of a 2018 Inspector
[1:55:28.160 --> 1:55:29.480]  General report.
[1:55:29.480 --> 1:55:35.080]  We found McCabe misled or lied to federal investigators about his role in a media leak
[1:55:35.080 --> 1:55:39.000]  that confirmed the FBI was investigating the Clinton Foundation.
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:44.800]  Michael E. Horowitz also found McCabe violated FBI media policy because the disclosure one
[1:55:44.800 --> 1:55:49.880]  week before the 2016 presidential election was not in the public interest, rather it
[1:55:49.880 --> 1:55:55.640]  was designed to benefit McCabe and push back against criticism he was compromised because
[1:55:55.640 --> 1:56:01.400]  his wife took more than $600,000 from Democrats for a 2015 state Senate race.
[1:56:01.400 --> 1:56:06.040]  This morning a senior Republican on the House Judiciary Committee said the McCabe allegation
[1:56:06.040 --> 1:56:11.040]  should not be seen in isolation given just last week the same Inspector General Michael
[1:56:11.040 --> 1:56:17.440]  E. Horowitz found McCabe's boss, former director Comey, is a leaker who violated FBI policy
[1:56:17.440 --> 1:56:20.440]  as well as his employment agreement.
[1:56:20.440 --> 1:56:25.000]  You look at the most recent IG report on James Comey and you put this all together and you're
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:30.440]  starting to see a picture of this, what I would call a soft coup attempt and Andy McCabe
[1:56:30.440 --> 1:56:31.960]  was right at the heart of it.
[1:56:31.960 --> 1:56:36.640]  Okay, I called it a soft coup attempt three years ago, we're the first to break it all.
[1:56:36.640 --> 1:56:40.360]  I had intelligence agencies all over my ass, luckily there were a bunch of limp wrists
[1:56:40.360 --> 1:56:43.120]  that left us trying to find out who was feeding me info.
[1:56:43.120 --> 1:56:47.520]  You morons admitted all in Congress in your own filings, you dumb jackasses.
[1:56:47.520 --> 1:56:50.520]  You don't think I don't know how to go read what you're up to?
[1:56:50.520 --> 1:56:56.520]  But you guys don't sit around till 2 a.m. reading, you're a bunch of lazy punks.
[1:56:56.520 --> 1:57:00.920]  We're gonna get your ass, you un-American chai-com traitors.
[1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:07.440]  And that's what they are, this isn't rhetoric, this is real, and this is the organic American
[1:57:07.440 --> 1:57:08.440]  resistance.
[1:57:08.440 --> 1:57:13.520]  We'll come back and play the really important clip, Congressman McClintock and the indictment
[1:57:13.520 --> 1:57:14.520]  that's coming.
[1:57:14.520 --> 1:57:16.520]  He will be indicted.
[1:57:16.520 --> 1:57:17.520]  Watch.
[1:57:17.520 --> 1:57:21.240]  That's not hope, that's the procedure.
[1:57:21.240 --> 1:57:23.480]  You understand how much trouble they're in?
[1:57:23.480 --> 1:57:26.000]  This is the time they can move against Trump.
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:31.720]  This is the time they can shut off a bomb, a new Oklahoma city, you work before for them.
[1:57:31.720 --> 1:57:36.000]  Everybody better watch their six right now, they've got the operatives in the field, they're
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  moving right now.
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:41.720]  I'm not sure how they're gonna hit us, but everybody better know, we're in a war for
[1:57:41.720 --> 1:57:46.120]  the very existence of this country.
[1:57:46.120 --> 1:57:49.800]  There are a few things in this universe that are assured of that, but I'm here to tell
[1:57:49.800 --> 1:57:53.480]  you the products that in FullWarsLife.com are.
[1:57:53.480 --> 1:58:01.040]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested, most loved, most documented substances
[1:58:01.040 --> 1:58:06.000]  that God gave us through Mother Nature, and then we make it even stronger, even better,
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:07.000]  and lower the price.
[1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:11.600]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches,
[1:58:11.600 --> 1:58:15.800]  it's good for the immune system, so many things, it sells itself.
[1:58:15.800 --> 1:58:22.600]  But normal turmeric only has three to five percent curcuminoid, the active enzyme or
[1:58:22.600 --> 1:58:26.440]  system in the plant, originally obviously from India.
[1:58:26.440 --> 1:58:32.800]  Well, body's ultimate turmeric formula has a 95% curcuminoid level, but it's got other
[1:58:32.800 --> 1:58:37.440]  natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it, and that's why people absolutely
[1:58:37.440 --> 1:58:38.440]  love it.
[1:58:38.440 --> 1:58:46.080]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet, 50% off on bodies at FullWarsLife.com.
[1:58:46.080 --> 1:58:50.320]  We sold Secret 12 for four years, and it was our number third best seller.
[1:58:50.320 --> 1:58:54.800]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename
[1:58:54.800 --> 1:58:55.800]  it.
[1:58:55.800 --> 1:58:57.360]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[1:58:57.360 --> 1:59:01.760]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[1:59:01.760 --> 1:59:07.080]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it, and it does amazing things,
[1:59:07.080 --> 1:59:11.360]  it's healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, helps the body produce energy, helps
[1:59:11.360 --> 1:59:15.120]  produce healthy blood cells, essential for proper nervous system function, it goes on
[1:59:15.120 --> 1:59:16.120]  and on.
[1:59:16.120 --> 1:59:19.760]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that could cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation,
[1:59:19.760 --> 1:59:23.960]  weight loss, depression, or memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[1:59:23.960 --> 1:59:26.360]  Bottom line folks, you need Ultra 12.
[1:59:26.360 --> 1:59:31.240]  It helps fund the InfoWare, so it's a 360 win, and it's 50% off for a limited time at
[1:59:31.240 --> 1:59:32.240]  InfoWareStore.com.
[1:59:32.240 --> 1:59:38.480]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last.
[1:59:38.480 --> 1:59:50.320]  Ultra 12, twice as powerful, cap the price, 50% off right now at InfoWareStore.com.
[1:59:50.320 --> 2:00:07.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:07.880 --> 2:00:14.000]  Well, I mean, if equal justice under law means anything, of course he should be indicted.
[2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:17.760]  We've known for the last year the Inspector General believes that he lied under oath,
[2:00:17.760 --> 2:00:18.920]  and don't forget.
[2:00:18.920 --> 2:00:26.040]  This is one of the people who prosecuted Michael Flynn for simply lying to the FBI, not under
[2:00:26.040 --> 2:00:27.040]  oath.
[2:00:27.040 --> 2:00:32.000]  So, yes, he needs to be prosecuted, but we also need to keep this in perspective.
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:35.520]  This is basically a side event, just a tip of a much larger iceberg.
[2:00:35.520 --> 2:00:40.440]  McCabe was one of the central figures in using the awesome powers that we give to the Department
[2:00:40.440 --> 2:00:48.280]  of Justice, the FBI, and our intelligence agencies to concoct a sham investigation of
[2:00:48.280 --> 2:00:54.360]  the Trump campaign, and later the administration, overcharges stemming from a dossier they knew
[2:00:54.360 --> 2:00:56.080]  to be false at the time.
[2:00:56.080 --> 2:01:02.200]  The next Inspector General's report will start to look at the abuse of the FISA, the secret
[2:01:02.200 --> 2:01:05.160]  court system, by people like McCabe.
[2:01:05.160 --> 2:01:10.040]  That's going to be far more significant because that was a direct assault on our democratic
[2:01:10.040 --> 2:01:11.960]  institutions as a nation.
[2:01:11.960 --> 2:01:13.720]  You know what's interesting?
[2:01:13.720 --> 2:01:18.680]  It may have been for the first time that people heard the name Andy McCabe in those text messages
[2:01:18.680 --> 2:01:23.160]  between the FBI agents who were having a marital of extramarital affair, who were going back
[2:01:23.160 --> 2:01:27.840]  and forth indicating some bias potentially at the FBI, and they were talking about a
[2:01:27.840 --> 2:01:33.360]  guy named Andy, and it was perceived that that was Andy McCabe, their boss.
[2:01:33.360 --> 2:01:38.720]  Doesn't matter the history there, and also what he lied about going forth.
[2:01:38.720 --> 2:01:42.520]  You know, you heard the President's attorney say, this isn't even the worst of what's
[2:01:42.520 --> 2:01:43.920]  to come.
[2:01:43.920 --> 2:01:49.240]  No, in fact, as I said, I think it's a side issue, I think the main issue.
[2:01:49.240 --> 2:01:54.600]  That discussion that you mentioned that was revealed in the Strzok page emails involved
[2:01:54.600 --> 2:02:02.440]  a discussion using this completely false narrative of Russian collusion with Trump in order to
[2:02:02.440 --> 2:02:08.000]  undermine and obstruct the duly elected President of the United States.
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:13.160]  That was the insurance policy that Strzok referred to.
[2:02:13.160 --> 2:02:18.400]  That was all hatched, it appears, in Andrew McCabe's office when he was the deputy director
[2:02:18.400 --> 2:02:19.800]  of the FBI.
[2:02:19.800 --> 2:02:24.560]  That is how deep this corruption goes, and it may go much farther as you work your way
[2:02:24.560 --> 2:02:25.720]  up the chain of command.
[2:02:25.720 --> 2:02:30.240]  Congressman McClintock, what can you tell me about what's happening on Capitol Hill?
[2:02:30.240 --> 2:02:34.480]  Everybody's back to work after the summer break now with regard to investigating the
[2:02:34.480 --> 2:02:38.700]  investigators as the President has formally put it, but that's really what we're talking
[2:02:38.700 --> 2:02:40.200]  about here.
[2:02:40.200 --> 2:02:45.080]  Well, sadly, the House Judiciary Committee under the leadership of the Democrats and
[2:02:45.080 --> 2:02:52.080]  Jerry Nadler have absolutely no interest at all in investigating how this monstrous lie
[2:02:52.080 --> 2:02:53.080]  was concocted.
[2:02:53.080 --> 2:02:54.080]  Why not?
[2:02:54.080 --> 2:02:55.080]  How our intelligence...
[2:02:55.080 --> 2:02:56.080]  They're a pack of criminals, that's right.
[2:02:56.080 --> 2:02:59.800] ...because it's embarrassing to them because it reveals that for the last three years they
[2:02:59.800 --> 2:03:03.440]  have perpetrated a massive lie on the American people.
[2:03:03.440 --> 2:03:08.240]  They used it first to try to influence the 2016 presidential election, and when they
[2:03:08.240 --> 2:03:12.440]  failed to do that, to undermine the constitutionally elected President of the United States.
[2:03:12.440 --> 2:03:14.440]  That is a direct attack on democracy.
[2:03:14.440 --> 2:03:19.440]  Trying to sabotage America, it didn't work.
[2:03:19.440 --> 2:03:22.920]  And by the way, I went ahead and had the crew get a bunch of these clips from congressional
[2:03:22.920 --> 2:03:23.920]  hearings.
[2:03:23.920 --> 2:03:28.320]  We play one here, one there, every month as it happens, but I'm going to shoot some video
[2:03:28.320 --> 2:03:32.000]  this weekend that we're going to air next week, like a little mini-documentary we're
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:37.680]  going to air, where you're going to see the CIA, the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation,
[2:03:37.680 --> 2:03:43.560]  the Rockefeller Foundation, the Board of Governors of the FCC, and you're going to see all these
[2:03:43.560 --> 2:03:49.760]  hearings, the Department of Defense hearings, House Defense Committee hearings, Senate Intelligence
[2:03:49.760 --> 2:03:56.760]  Committee hearings, saying I'm a Russian agent three years ago, two years ago, and this year,
[2:03:56.760 --> 2:03:58.400]  and then taking me off the Internet.
[2:03:58.400 --> 2:04:03.240]  That's what they really did, and they made up all those excuses because they had an order
[2:04:03.240 --> 2:04:05.240]  to do it.
[2:04:05.240 --> 2:04:07.240]  They said I said racist stuff.
[2:04:07.240 --> 2:04:09.560]  They said I did all this other stuff I didn't even do.
[2:04:09.560 --> 2:04:13.160]  They said I beat up a kid on video, totally made up.
[2:04:13.160 --> 2:04:16.320]  They say I lost a Sandy Hook suit for a book I wrote, never wrote a book.
[2:04:16.320 --> 2:04:20.080]  It's a total lie, AP.
[2:04:20.080 --> 2:04:21.640]  They're on the list to fall suit on.
[2:04:21.640 --> 2:04:25.120]  We've decided to do it in two weeks now to see how the federal suits look to line them
[2:04:25.120 --> 2:04:27.120]  up with those, but it's going to happen.
[2:04:27.120 --> 2:04:29.520]  You know, I'm not a victim here.
[2:04:29.520 --> 2:04:32.880]  I'm saying we're all victims of the lie.
[2:04:32.880 --> 2:04:37.160]  It's the CIA doing all that to me, to Trump to you.
[2:04:37.160 --> 2:04:39.160]  It's not our CIA.
[2:04:39.160 --> 2:04:42.600]  It's leftist on the Chinese payroll.
[2:04:42.600 --> 2:04:44.600]  They're all going to have to go to prison that we're involved.
[2:04:44.600 --> 2:04:46.600]  It's not everybody in the government.
[2:04:46.600 --> 2:04:48.600]  It's a large portion of them.
[2:04:48.600 --> 2:04:50.600]  This country's fighting for its life.
[2:04:50.600 --> 2:04:54.600]  We'll be right back.
[2:04:54.600 --> 2:04:57.400]  Happies is a tincture that you take under the tongue.
[2:04:57.400 --> 2:04:59.720]  You've been selling it for over a year.
[2:04:59.720 --> 2:05:04.920]  It's a private label of one of the top national sellers of herbs that's known to calm the
[2:05:04.920 --> 2:05:06.600]  body but not be an oppressant.
[2:05:06.600 --> 2:05:10.360]  Now, despite the fact that I've never really promoted or cut an ad for it, it's in our

[2:05:42.600 --> 2:05:45.120]  has really worked for myself and so many others.

[2:06:18.760 --> 2:06:26.600]  probably 15 years or so, blackgenocide.org is going to come on because when you hear
[2:06:26.600 --> 2:06:33.520]  them push all this stuff about Planned Parenthood and Trumps or racists and all that, I think
[2:06:33.520 --> 2:06:37.640]  you need to hear from somebody who's probably done more research than even I've done, and
[2:06:37.640 --> 2:06:43.320]  who's produced films and screamed them to Congress and done more than most people that
[2:06:43.320 --> 2:06:54.160]  are prominent in the pro-life movement combined in actually showing the true racism, the anti-human,
[2:06:54.160 --> 2:06:58.320]  the anti-God, the anti-child behavior.
[2:06:58.320 --> 2:07:03.800]  But first I wanted to play this little six, seven-minute compilation for Reverend Childress.
[2:07:03.800 --> 2:07:07.080]  And then after he's gone, the last segment of the show, I'm going to get into how the
[2:07:07.080 --> 2:07:09.880]  left's coming for the guns, how they want to start a civil war, how that's part of the
[2:07:09.880 --> 2:07:11.360]  plan and how to stop it.
[2:07:11.360 --> 2:07:15.320]  That's a critical last segment, then something special in the fourth hour I'll tell you about.
[2:07:15.320 --> 2:07:20.680]  But I wanted to play this first for the Reverend because I told the crew last week, I said,
[2:07:20.680 --> 2:07:25.560]  or I guess early this week, I said, hey, we've got all those clips, we walk up the Democrats
[2:07:25.560 --> 2:07:28.920]  in the street and they start saying, I want to kill kids up to age three, they're parasites,
[2:07:28.920 --> 2:07:31.240]  I hate them, get some of those clips.
[2:07:31.240 --> 2:07:36.240]  Well, McBreen ended up putting together like 30 minutes of it, and I said, they cut it
[2:07:36.240 --> 2:07:38.400]  down to like six, seven minutes.
[2:07:38.400 --> 2:07:43.320]  But now there's the new fetish of the national news of getting pregnant to kill the baby.
[2:07:43.320 --> 2:07:45.480]  And the women say it's an act of selfishness.
[2:07:45.480 --> 2:07:46.480]  I love it.
[2:07:46.480 --> 2:07:48.000]  I love the power I have.
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:51.280]  And then now they're calling them babies and saying, we're going to kill the babies and
[2:07:51.280 --> 2:07:56.920]  they're keeping them alive and selling their organs and imposing with the dead bodies.
[2:07:56.920 --> 2:07:59.240]  Nothing's too macabre for these people.
[2:07:59.240 --> 2:08:00.240]  You can't make this up.
[2:08:00.240 --> 2:08:02.400]  I know you're hearing this and it's like, this isn't real.
[2:08:02.400 --> 2:08:05.440]  No, this is when the bottom drops out.
[2:08:05.440 --> 2:08:08.280]  Every culture, when it collapses, starts sacrificing children.
[2:08:08.280 --> 2:08:09.840]  The left's been doing it covertly.
[2:08:09.840 --> 2:08:12.000]  Now they're overtly externalizing them.
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:13.000]  Hey, we want your guns.
[2:08:13.000 --> 2:08:15.680]  We're going to have drag queen story time with convicted pedophiles.
[2:08:15.680 --> 2:08:18.440]  The kids are going to ride horsey.
[2:08:18.440 --> 2:08:19.440]  We're going to groom your kids.
[2:08:19.440 --> 2:08:20.440]  It's all out in the open.
[2:08:20.440 --> 2:08:23.000]  So I'm going to play this and then Reverend Childress' take.
[2:08:23.000 --> 2:08:25.000]  But here's the report.
[2:08:25.000 --> 2:08:30.400]  Our main story tonight concerns breast implants.
[2:08:30.400 --> 2:08:31.400]  Some are against them.
[2:08:31.400 --> 2:08:33.400]  Others believe they're fine in rare cases.
[2:08:33.400 --> 2:08:36.880]  And many believe you should be able to get them whenever the f**k you want.
[2:08:36.880 --> 2:08:39.400]  Sorry, did I say breast implants?
[2:08:39.400 --> 2:08:41.400]  I meant abortions.
[2:08:41.400 --> 2:08:44.400]  Tonight's main topic concerns abortion.
[2:08:44.400 --> 2:08:50.400]  So tonight, in honor of America, I'd like to do a salute to abortion in the Brace 10th
[2:08:50.400 --> 2:08:53.400]  Annual Salute to Abortion.
[2:08:53.400 --> 2:08:55.400]  Get out of my behind.
[2:08:55.400 --> 2:08:57.400]  Get out of my vagina.
[2:08:57.400 --> 2:08:58.400]  Get out.
[2:08:58.400 --> 2:09:02.880]  It's a woman's body and she should not be forced to carry anything inside of it.
[2:09:02.880 --> 2:09:04.880]  She wouldn't make her keep a tapeworm.
[2:09:04.880 --> 2:09:05.880]  That has a heartbeat.
[2:09:05.880 --> 2:09:08.880]  So you're comparing a baby to a tapeworm?
[2:09:08.880 --> 2:09:09.880]  A fetus is a parasite.
[2:09:09.880 --> 2:09:10.880]  Sweetie.
[2:09:10.880 --> 2:09:12.880]  Tonight is not what a fetus looks like, okay?
[2:09:12.880 --> 2:09:14.880]  It's a clip of cells at 12 weeks.
[2:09:14.880 --> 2:09:18.880]  You think that it is the white man's duty to fix everybody's problems, right?
[2:09:18.880 --> 2:09:20.880]  How many did you adopt?
[2:09:20.880 --> 2:09:21.880]  How many did I adopt?
[2:09:21.880 --> 2:09:22.880]  I kill my kids.
[2:09:22.880 --> 2:09:24.880]  I kill my kids.
[2:09:24.880 --> 2:09:26.880]  You've got amazing grace being sung.
[2:09:26.880 --> 2:09:30.880]  I don't know if AM radio picks it up, but they're saying Hail Satan.
[2:09:30.880 --> 2:09:35.880]  And the news confirmed, that's what they're saying.
[2:09:35.880 --> 2:09:37.880]  There she is, Hail Satan, sticks her tongue out.
[2:09:37.880 --> 2:09:41.880]  You got to repent, sir, for murdering babies.
[2:09:41.880 --> 2:09:42.880]  Why?
[2:09:42.880 --> 2:09:43.880]  Because it's a sin before God.
[2:09:43.880 --> 2:09:44.880]  Why?
[2:09:44.880 --> 2:09:45.880]  Wow.
[2:09:45.880 --> 2:09:46.880]  Stinky breath.
[2:09:46.880 --> 2:09:48.880]  Yeah, that's pretty evil of you, sir.
[2:09:48.880 --> 2:09:49.880]  Yeah, I am.
[2:09:49.880 --> 2:09:51.880]  And I hope and pray that you...
[2:09:51.880 --> 2:09:54.880]  Well, that's what you do to babies, huh?
[2:09:54.880 --> 2:09:55.880]  I love it.
[2:09:55.880 --> 2:09:56.880]  You love it, huh?
[2:09:56.880 --> 2:09:57.880]  Yeah, I do.
[2:09:57.880 --> 2:09:59.880]  Okay, I hope that you come to Christ, sir.
[2:09:59.880 --> 2:10:00.880]  I never go to Christ.
[2:10:00.880 --> 2:10:01.880]  I hope that you come to Christ, sir.
[2:10:01.880 --> 2:10:02.880]  No, I don't go to Christ.
[2:10:02.880 --> 2:10:03.880]  Yeah, you...
[2:10:03.880 --> 2:10:04.880]  I don't listen to Christ.
[2:10:04.880 --> 2:10:05.880]  You will have a darkened heart, sir.
[2:10:05.880 --> 2:10:06.880]  I do have a darkened heart.
[2:10:06.880 --> 2:10:07.880]  Yeah.
[2:10:07.880 --> 2:10:08.880]  You have a darkened heart.
[2:10:08.880 --> 2:10:09.880]  I do.
[2:10:09.880 --> 2:10:10.880]  I do very, very much so.
[2:10:10.880 --> 2:10:11.880]  And you will stand before God in judgment.
[2:10:11.880 --> 2:10:12.880]  Yes, I will.
[2:10:12.880 --> 2:10:13.880]  Every day.
[2:10:13.880 --> 2:10:14.880]  You will stand before God in judgment.
[2:10:14.880 --> 2:10:15.880]  Yes, I will.
[2:10:15.880 --> 2:10:16.880]  Every day.
[2:10:16.880 --> 2:10:17.880]  All of the babies...
[2:10:17.880 --> 2:10:18.880]  I love it.
[2:10:18.880 --> 2:10:19.880]  I love it.
[2:10:19.880 --> 2:10:20.880]  Yeah, keep tearing the babies apart.
[2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:21.880]  Yeah, I will.
[2:10:21.880 --> 2:10:22.880]  Keep tearing the babies apart.
[2:10:22.880 --> 2:10:23.880]  I will.
[2:10:23.880 --> 2:10:49.880]  I hate the goods.
[2:10:49.880 --> 2:10:52.880]  I hate the goods.
[2:10:52.880 --> 2:10:53.880]  Are you a pig?
[2:10:53.880 --> 2:10:54.880]  You're a pig.
[2:10:54.880 --> 2:10:55.880]  Because I don't let them come, baby.
[2:10:55.880 --> 2:10:56.880]  Oh, you killed them.
[2:10:56.880 --> 2:10:58.880]  You let them live so they can starve to death.
[2:10:58.880 --> 2:10:59.880]  Damn.
[2:10:59.880 --> 2:11:01.880]  Why'd you spit at us?
[2:11:01.880 --> 2:11:03.880]  I don't agree with you.
[2:11:03.880 --> 2:11:04.880]  No uterus.
[2:11:04.880 --> 2:11:06.880]  No right to talk about it.
[2:11:06.880 --> 2:11:08.880]  Understand me, mother f***er?
[2:11:08.880 --> 2:11:10.880]  So when do we cut off abortions at what week?
[2:11:10.880 --> 2:11:12.880]  I think at three years old.
[2:11:12.880 --> 2:11:13.880]  That's when we should.
[2:11:13.880 --> 2:11:17.880]  I also had my first abortion at the Seattle Plant Parenthood.
[2:11:17.880 --> 2:11:19.880]  Yay!
[2:11:19.880 --> 2:11:21.880]  I had an abortion!
[2:11:21.880 --> 2:11:25.880]  I had an abortion on a big Friday!
[2:11:25.880 --> 2:11:28.880]  On the topic, on the fetal tissue side of it,
[2:11:28.880 --> 2:11:32.880]  you know, it'd be helpful for us to understand volume-wise.
[2:11:32.880 --> 2:11:36.880]  I mean, realistically, if we were to do an agreement with you guys,
[2:11:36.880 --> 2:11:38.880]  you know, what do we think you could get?
[2:11:38.880 --> 2:11:39.880]  I mean, what do you feel like you could get?
[2:11:39.880 --> 2:11:40.880]  Volume-wise?
[2:11:40.880 --> 2:11:41.880]  Yeah.
[2:11:41.880 --> 2:11:42.880]  On specifically liver tissue,
[2:11:42.880 --> 2:11:45.880]  because that's such an area of demand for us.
[2:11:45.880 --> 2:11:46.880]  Right.
[2:11:46.880 --> 2:11:49.880]  So liver and what about intact specimens?
[2:11:49.880 --> 2:11:52.880]  Oh, yeah, I mean, if you had intact cases,
[2:11:52.880 --> 2:11:53.880]  which we've done a lot,
[2:11:53.880 --> 2:11:56.880]  so we've sometimes shipped those back to our lab in its entirety,
[2:11:56.880 --> 2:11:58.880]  you know, you can imagine where they would run with this,
[2:11:58.880 --> 2:11:59.880]  like, they're selling body parts, you know.
[2:11:59.880 --> 2:12:03.880]  So I say, okay, what are you looking to supply today?
[2:12:03.880 --> 2:12:06.880]  We're asked to procure certain tissues,
[2:12:06.880 --> 2:12:11.880]  like brain, liver, thymus, pancreas, heart, lungs,
[2:12:11.880 --> 2:12:15.880]  and pretty much anything on the fetus.
[2:12:15.880 --> 2:12:21.880]  If we alter a process and we are able to obtain
[2:12:21.880 --> 2:12:24.880]  intact fetal cadavers,
[2:12:24.880 --> 2:12:27.880]  it's all just a matter of line items.
[2:12:27.880 --> 2:12:28.880]  Tell the lab it's coming.
[2:12:28.880 --> 2:12:29.880]  It'll open the box.
[2:12:31.880 --> 2:12:35.880]  And are we agreed that $100 would keep you happy?
[2:12:35.880 --> 2:12:40.880]  I don't want to live with you anymore.
[2:12:40.880 --> 2:12:43.880]  In the ninth month, you can take the baby
[2:12:43.880 --> 2:12:47.880]  and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother
[2:12:47.880 --> 2:12:50.880]  just prior to the birth of the baby.
[2:12:50.880 --> 2:12:53.880]  Now, you can say that that's okay,
[2:12:53.880 --> 2:12:55.880]  and Hillary can say that that's okay,
[2:12:55.880 --> 2:12:57.880]  but it's not okay with me.
[2:12:57.880 --> 2:12:59.880]  Well, that is not what happens in these cases,
[2:12:59.880 --> 2:13:02.880]  and using that kind of scare rhetoric
[2:13:02.880 --> 2:13:05.880]  is just terribly unfortunate.
[2:13:05.880 --> 2:13:07.880]  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo lit up
[2:13:07.880 --> 2:13:10.880]  the One World Trade Center's Spire in Pink
[2:13:10.880 --> 2:13:13.880]  to celebrate his erotical expansion of abortion in New York.
[2:13:13.880 --> 2:13:15.880]  State lawmakers approved a law
[2:13:15.880 --> 2:13:17.880]  permitting abortion in the state
[2:13:17.880 --> 2:13:20.880]  for any reason until the 24th week of pregnancy
[2:13:20.880 --> 2:13:22.880]  and then up until birth.
[2:13:22.880 --> 2:13:23.880]  If a mother is in labor,
[2:13:23.880 --> 2:13:25.880]  I can tell you exactly what would happen.
[2:13:25.880 --> 2:13:27.880]  The infant would be delivered.
[2:13:27.880 --> 2:13:29.880]  The infant would be kept comfortable.
[2:13:29.880 --> 2:13:31.880]  The infant would be resuscitated
[2:13:31.880 --> 2:13:34.880]  if that's what the mother and the family desired,
[2:13:34.880 --> 2:13:36.880]  and then a discussion would ensue
[2:13:36.880 --> 2:13:38.880]  between the physicians and the mother.
[2:13:38.880 --> 2:13:40.880]  There was a question over here.
[2:13:40.880 --> 2:13:41.880]  Yes.
[2:13:41.880 --> 2:13:44.880]  Are you for third trimester abortions?
[2:13:44.880 --> 2:13:47.880]  My answer to you is that that should be a decision
[2:13:47.880 --> 2:13:49.880]  that the woman makes.
[2:13:49.880 --> 2:13:52.880]  There's scientific consensus
[2:13:52.880 --> 2:13:55.880]  that the lives of children are going to be very difficult.
[2:13:55.880 --> 2:13:57.880]  Is it okay to still have children?
[2:13:57.880 --> 2:13:59.880]  How do you justify the decision
[2:13:59.880 --> 2:14:03.880]  to allow Planned Parenthood to rent in this city for free?
[2:14:03.880 --> 2:14:05.880]  That's your time.
[2:14:05.880 --> 2:14:06.880]  Next speaker.
[2:14:06.880 --> 2:14:08.880]  There's a new video out on inforwars.com
[2:14:08.880 --> 2:14:12.880]  of two partial birth abortions,
[2:14:12.880 --> 2:14:14.880]  eight and a half month old babies.
[2:14:14.880 --> 2:14:17.880]  And it makes you want to kill people.
[2:14:17.880 --> 2:14:20.880]  I'm just going to be honest with you right now.
[2:14:20.880 --> 2:14:23.880]  My guts, my spirit sees a baby
[2:14:23.880 --> 2:14:26.880]  who got killed and its brain sucked out
[2:14:26.880 --> 2:14:27.880]  by some asshole,
[2:14:27.880 --> 2:14:29.880]  and then they make a joke out of it.
[2:14:29.880 --> 2:14:33.880]  These are abortion doctors with third trimester babies
[2:14:33.880 --> 2:14:35.880]  that were about to be born.
[2:14:35.880 --> 2:14:37.880]  The filing them, they can joke about them
[2:14:37.880 --> 2:14:38.880]  that they're having a fight.
[2:14:38.880 --> 2:14:40.880]  They're playing with dead babies
[2:14:40.880 --> 2:14:44.880]  in a little medical pan,
[2:14:44.880 --> 2:14:47.880]  and it was pretty shocking through some stuff to see
[2:14:47.880 --> 2:14:50.880]  and just total lack of regard for humanity.
[2:14:50.880 --> 2:14:52.880]  That's just absolutely amazing.
[2:14:52.880 --> 2:14:55.880]  We're going to have Debbie Johnson.
[2:14:55.880 --> 2:14:57.880]  I'm sorry.
[2:14:57.880 --> 2:15:03.880]  God bless abortions and God bless America!
[2:15:03.880 --> 2:15:06.880]  Don't knock it till you try it.
[2:15:06.880 --> 2:15:09.880]  And when you do try it, really knock it.
[2:15:09.880 --> 2:15:12.880]  You know, you got to get that baby out of there.
[2:15:12.880 --> 2:15:14.880]  What a sick demon.
[2:15:14.880 --> 2:15:15.880]  We'll come back from break,
[2:15:15.880 --> 2:15:16.880]  Reverend Childress will have the floor
[2:15:16.880 --> 2:15:17.880]  to break down the history of this,
[2:15:17.880 --> 2:15:19.880]  why they're coming out in the open.
[2:15:19.880 --> 2:15:21.880]  And I've got stuff even worse
[2:15:21.880 --> 2:15:24.880]  that we didn't even put in that because of time.
[2:15:24.880 --> 2:15:27.880]  We've got them saying it's sexually pleasurable
[2:15:27.880 --> 2:15:29.880]  and they get pregnant on purpose
[2:15:29.880 --> 2:15:31.880]  so they can kill babies.
[2:15:31.880 --> 2:15:33.880]  Well, you saw some of them say that.
[2:15:33.880 --> 2:15:34.880]  And then they tell you, I love Satan,
[2:15:34.880 --> 2:15:36.880]  and they're not joking around, folks.
[2:15:36.880 --> 2:15:38.880]  Devil's real.
[2:15:38.880 --> 2:15:41.880]  And I'm asking, what are we going to do about this?
[2:15:41.880 --> 2:15:42.880]  We're right back with Reverend Childress
[2:15:42.880 --> 2:15:44.880]  of blackgenocide.org
[2:15:44.880 --> 2:15:46.880]  to break down what's really going on.
[2:15:46.880 --> 2:15:55.880]  We'll see you next time.
[2:15:55.880 --> 2:16:17.880]  We'll see you next time.
[2:16:25.880 --> 2:16:52.880]  We'll see you next time.
[2:16:52.880 --> 2:16:54.880]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[2:16:54.880 --> 2:16:56.880]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[2:16:56.880 --> 2:16:58.880]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[2:16:58.880 --> 2:16:59.880]  I sued the IRS in one.
[2:16:59.880 --> 2:17:00.880]  I beat the IRS then,
[2:17:00.880 --> 2:17:02.880]  and I've been beating them ever since.
[2:17:02.880 --> 2:17:04.880]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement,
[2:17:04.880 --> 2:17:06.880]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[2:17:06.880 --> 2:17:08.880]  they thought might never be solved.
[2:17:08.880 --> 2:17:09.880]  I can help you too.
[2:17:09.880 --> 2:17:10.880]  If you owe taxes you can't pay,
[2:17:10.880 --> 2:17:12.880]  don't wait another day.
[2:17:12.880 --> 2:17:14.880]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[2:18:06.880 --> 2:18:08.880]  We have been blessed with their listeners
[2:18:08.880 --> 2:18:10.880]  and let us private label it in the last two years.
[2:18:10.880 --> 2:18:12.880]  It's been a best seller.
[2:18:12.880 --> 2:18:14.880]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream
[2:18:14.880 --> 2:18:16.880]  that basically mimics the top skin creams
[2:18:16.880 --> 2:18:18.880]  that are already out there
[2:18:18.880 --> 2:18:20.880]  at a lower price with their patented
[2:18:20.880 --> 2:18:22.880]  silver salt technology in it.
[2:18:22.880 --> 2:18:24.880]  It's got the hyaluronic acid.
[2:18:24.880 --> 2:18:26.880]  It's got the steric acid.
[2:18:26.880 --> 2:18:28.880]  It's got the grapefruit essential oil.
[2:18:28.880 --> 2:18:30.880]  It's got the nano silver coconut oil
[2:18:30.880 --> 2:18:32.880]  and so much more.
[2:18:32.880 --> 2:18:34.880]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream
[2:18:34.880 --> 2:18:36.880]  in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one.
[2:18:36.880 --> 2:18:38.880]  You're not going to find a product that's good anywhere.
[2:18:38.880 --> 2:18:40.880]  You're certainly not going to find it at this price.
[2:18:40.880 --> 2:18:42.880]  And it funds the InfoWare
[2:18:42.880 --> 2:18:44.880]  at infowarslife.com.
[2:18:44.880 --> 2:18:46.880]  Get your super silver
[2:18:46.880 --> 2:18:48.880]  skin cream today.
[2:18:48.880 --> 2:18:50.880]  We can only run this special for another week or so
[2:18:50.880 --> 2:18:52.880]  as I'm taping this September 10th.
[2:18:54.880 --> 2:18:56.880]  There are few things in this universe
[2:18:56.880 --> 2:18:58.880]  that are assured of that, but I'm here to tell you
[2:18:58.880 --> 2:19:00.880]  the products that InfoWarslife.com
[2:19:00.880 --> 2:19:02.880]  are.
[2:19:02.880 --> 2:19:04.880]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated,
[2:19:04.880 --> 2:19:06.880]  best tested,
[2:19:06.880 --> 2:19:08.880]  most loved, most documented
[2:19:08.880 --> 2:19:10.880]  substances that God gave us to mother nature.
[2:19:10.880 --> 2:19:12.880]  And then we
[2:19:12.880 --> 2:19:14.880]  make it even stronger, even better
[2:19:14.880 --> 2:19:16.880]  and lower the price.
[2:19:16.880 --> 2:19:18.880]  Now turmeric has been known for thousands of years
[2:19:18.880 --> 2:19:20.880]  to help with inflammation, headaches,
[2:19:20.880 --> 2:19:22.880]  it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[2:19:22.880 --> 2:19:24.880]  It sells itself.
[2:19:24.880 --> 2:19:26.880]  But normal turmeric
[2:19:26.880 --> 2:19:28.880]  only has 3-5% curcuminoid
[2:19:28.880 --> 2:19:30.880]  the active enzyme
[2:19:30.880 --> 2:19:32.880]  or system in the plant.
[2:19:32.880 --> 2:19:34.880]  Originally obviously from India.
[2:19:34.880 --> 2:19:36.880]  Well, body's ultimate turmeric formula
[2:19:36.880 --> 2:19:38.880]  has a 95%
[2:19:38.880 --> 2:19:40.880]  curcuminoid level
[2:19:40.880 --> 2:19:42.880]  that's got other natural things
[2:19:42.880 --> 2:19:44.880]  that help boost it, help your body absorb it
[2:19:44.880 --> 2:19:46.880]  and that's why people absolutely love it.
[2:19:46.880 --> 2:19:48.880]  I'm doing this
[2:19:48.880 --> 2:19:50.880]  offer for people that haven't tried it yet.
[2:19:50.880 --> 2:19:52.880]  50% off on bodies
[2:19:52.880 --> 2:20:10.880]  and that's why people love it.
[2:20:10.880 --> 2:20:12.880]  All right, I'm not going to go over Reverend
[2:20:12.880 --> 2:20:14.880]  Childress' whole bio, his books,
[2:20:14.880 --> 2:20:16.880]  his 700 club appearances,
[2:20:16.880 --> 2:20:18.880]  his moves to produce films
[2:20:18.880 --> 2:20:20.880]  and show them to people in Congress
[2:20:20.880 --> 2:20:22.880]  and to people to understand what's going on
[2:20:22.880 --> 2:20:24.880]  killing babies even after they're born now
[2:20:24.880 --> 2:20:26.880]  not just the partial birth, it's unbelievably evil.
[2:20:26.880 --> 2:20:28.880]  Black genocide out of ORG
[2:20:28.880 --> 2:20:30.880]  but I wanted to get him on
[2:20:30.880 --> 2:20:32.880]  because there's been this coming out now
[2:20:32.880 --> 2:20:34.880]  where you just saw him on Comedy Central
[2:20:34.880 --> 2:20:36.880]  and Netflix saying, we love to kill babies,
[2:20:36.880 --> 2:20:38.880]  they are babies and things so sick
[2:20:38.880 --> 2:20:40.880]  I can't even say them on air
[2:20:40.880 --> 2:20:42.880]  and the pedophilia and just all of it
[2:20:42.880 --> 2:20:44.880]  rushing outward, what does Reverend Childress
[2:20:44.880 --> 2:20:46.880]  think about this and then all these calls
[2:20:46.880 --> 2:20:48.880]  that trumps a racist
[2:20:48.880 --> 2:20:50.880]  and just his view on that
[2:20:50.880 --> 2:20:52.880]  when Trump's marching with the pro-life groups
[2:20:52.880 --> 2:20:54.880]  and we all know it kills more
[2:20:54.880 --> 2:20:56.880]  people in this country than anything else
[2:20:56.880 --> 2:20:58.880]  it's abortions
[2:20:58.880 --> 2:21:00.880]  particularly for black folks
[2:21:00.880 --> 2:21:02.880]  so we're talking about facts with Reverend Childress
[2:21:02.880 --> 2:21:04.880]  Reverend, you've got the floor in the next two segments
[2:21:04.880 --> 2:21:06.880]  thanks for coming on, thanks for holding while I played that
[2:21:06.880 --> 2:21:08.880]  I know you were pretty shocked watching
[2:21:08.880 --> 2:21:10.880]  and I was watching your face but we've got even more
[2:21:10.880 --> 2:21:12.880]  sickening stuff, what is your take on what you just saw?
[2:21:12.880 --> 2:21:14.880]  You know, America
[2:21:14.880 --> 2:21:16.880]  you know, the line has really been drawn
[2:21:16.880 --> 2:21:18.880]  in the sand
[2:21:18.880 --> 2:21:20.880]  without question
[2:21:20.880 --> 2:21:22.880]  conscious wise, politically wise
[2:21:22.880 --> 2:21:24.880]  you understand when Jill Stanek
[2:21:24.880 --> 2:21:26.880]  brought out the fact that these babies
[2:21:26.880 --> 2:21:28.880]  were being born alive
[2:21:28.880 --> 2:21:30.880]  and confronted Barack Obama
[2:21:30.880 --> 2:21:32.880]  basically single-handedly
[2:21:32.880 --> 2:21:34.880]  it was somewhat
[2:21:34.880 --> 2:21:36.880]  in stealth, it was somewhat
[2:21:36.880 --> 2:21:38.880]  undercover, that was
[2:21:38.880 --> 2:21:40.880]  2007, 2008
[2:21:40.880 --> 2:21:42.880]  now you're hearing Ralph
[2:21:42.880 --> 2:21:44.880]  Northam, a sitting governor
[2:21:44.880 --> 2:21:46.880]  Andrew Como
[2:21:46.880 --> 2:21:48.880]  a sitting governor
[2:21:48.880 --> 2:21:50.880]  blatantly
[2:21:50.880 --> 2:21:52.880]  and profoundly
[2:21:52.880 --> 2:21:54.880]  just saying this is what we're going to do
[2:21:54.880 --> 2:21:56.880]  this is what we do
[2:21:56.880 --> 2:21:58.880]  and this is something that's good for America
[2:21:58.880 --> 2:22:00.880]  and so
[2:22:00.880 --> 2:22:02.880]  we have seen the growth
[2:22:02.880 --> 2:22:04.880]  of infanticide
[2:22:04.880 --> 2:22:06.880]  to the degree where they wanted
[2:22:06.880 --> 2:22:08.880]  to be a part of your conscience
[2:22:08.880 --> 2:22:10.880]  and acceptance
[2:22:10.880 --> 2:22:12.880]  and Ralph Northam
[2:22:12.880 --> 2:22:14.880]  was chilling enough
[2:22:14.880 --> 2:22:16.880]  and by the way
[2:22:16.880 --> 2:22:18.880]  I think they've overplayed it
[2:22:18.880 --> 2:22:20.880]  right now
[2:22:20.880 --> 2:22:22.880]  I think the last poll
[2:22:22.880 --> 2:22:24.880]  basically says 60%
[2:22:24.880 --> 2:22:26.880]  of people do want restrictions
[2:22:26.880 --> 2:22:28.880]  and we can thank Ralph Northam and Andrew Como
[2:22:28.880 --> 2:22:30.880]  for
[2:22:30.880 --> 2:22:32.880]  blatantly saying what they were
[2:22:32.880 --> 2:22:34.880]  espousing, what they generally
[2:22:34.880 --> 2:22:36.880]  want to bring into America wholesale
[2:22:36.880 --> 2:22:38.880]  now there is a political
[2:22:38.880 --> 2:22:40.880]  strategy of that
[2:22:40.880 --> 2:22:42.880]  and we sense that the people's
[2:22:42.880 --> 2:22:44.880]  consciences unquestionably
[2:22:44.880 --> 2:22:46.880]  are
[2:22:46.880 --> 2:22:48.880]  to the point where this will go back
[2:22:48.880 --> 2:22:50.880]  to the states one day
[2:22:50.880 --> 2:22:52.880]  but now they're just
[2:22:52.880 --> 2:22:54.880]  on a wild marketing
[2:22:54.880 --> 2:22:56.880]  scheme
[2:22:56.880 --> 2:22:58.880]  to basically neutralize any damage
[2:22:58.880 --> 2:23:00.880]  that has been done
[2:23:00.880 --> 2:23:02.880]  and really make abortion a part
[2:23:02.880 --> 2:23:04.880]  of the equation when it comes to
[2:23:04.880 --> 2:23:06.880]  a pregnancy
[2:23:06.880 --> 2:23:08.880]  and the conscience and the heart
[2:23:08.880 --> 2:23:10.880]  so
[2:23:10.880 --> 2:23:12.880]  that was one of the most moving
[2:23:12.880 --> 2:23:14.880]  montages
[2:23:14.880 --> 2:23:16.880]  I've seen basically
[2:23:16.880 --> 2:23:18.880]  really depicting
[2:23:18.880 --> 2:23:20.880]  the state of the
[2:23:20.880 --> 2:23:22.880]  present Democratic Party
[2:23:22.880 --> 2:23:24.880]  for the first time
[2:23:24.880 --> 2:23:26.880]  you have 24 candidates
[2:23:26.880 --> 2:23:28.880]  I don't know what is down to
[2:23:28.880 --> 2:23:30.880]  maybe down to a little less right now
[2:23:30.880 --> 2:23:32.880]  America you have 24
[2:23:32.880 --> 2:23:34.880]  candidates espousing infanticide
[2:23:34.880 --> 2:23:36.880]  you probably have the most
[2:23:36.880 --> 2:23:38.880]  pro-life president
[2:23:38.880 --> 2:23:40.880]  of America's history
[2:23:40.880 --> 2:23:42.880]  or since Roe versus Wade
[2:23:42.880 --> 2:23:44.880]  I mean the clash
[2:23:44.880 --> 2:23:46.880]  is just
[2:23:46.880 --> 2:23:48.880]  tremendous right now and
[2:23:48.880 --> 2:23:50.880]  choose you this day whom you will serve
[2:23:50.880 --> 2:23:52.880]  and I love that
[2:23:52.880 --> 2:23:54.880]  piece you played and I remember that
[2:23:54.880 --> 2:23:56.880]  debate and
[2:23:56.880 --> 2:23:58.880]  Donald Trump very simply said
[2:23:58.880 --> 2:24:00.880]  that's not alright with me and it shouldn't be
[2:24:00.880 --> 2:24:02.880]  alright with any American
[2:24:02.880 --> 2:24:04.880]  but I want to say
[2:24:04.880 --> 2:24:06.880]  I have to thank Ralph Northam
[2:24:06.880 --> 2:24:08.880]  and I have to thank Andrew Como
[2:24:08.880 --> 2:24:10.880]  because many people
[2:24:10.880 --> 2:24:12.880]  who have been able to put this on the back burner
[2:24:12.880 --> 2:24:14.880]  are now realizing
[2:24:14.880 --> 2:24:16.880]  what really is going on in these clinics
[2:24:16.880 --> 2:24:18.880]  that this right now
[2:24:18.880 --> 2:24:20.880]  America is a country that
[2:24:20.880 --> 2:24:22.880]  sacrifices babies to MOLAC
[2:24:22.880 --> 2:24:24.880]  is engaged in child
[2:24:24.880 --> 2:24:26.880]  sacrifice and
[2:24:26.880 --> 2:24:28.880]  I really think they're going to pay for it
[2:24:28.880 --> 2:24:30.880]  in November 2020
[2:24:30.880 --> 2:24:32.880]  I'm looking at some of the demographics
[2:24:32.880 --> 2:24:34.880]  I'm looking at some of the data
[2:24:34.880 --> 2:24:36.880]  I think right now
[2:24:36.880 --> 2:24:38.880]  really for the first time in a long time
[2:24:38.880 --> 2:24:40.880]  the issue of abortion
[2:24:40.880 --> 2:24:42.880]  really will come
[2:24:42.880 --> 2:24:44.880]  center stage
[2:24:44.880 --> 2:24:46.880]  because of their insistence
[2:24:46.880 --> 2:24:48.880]  on infanticide
[2:24:48.880 --> 2:24:50.880]  and I also want to say this to all your African
[2:24:50.880 --> 2:24:52.880]  American listeners
[2:24:52.880 --> 2:24:54.880]  Martin Luther King is the
[2:24:54.880 --> 2:24:56.880]  probably the most
[2:24:56.880 --> 2:24:58.880]  identifiable iconic figure
[2:24:58.880 --> 2:25:00.880]  when it comes to civil rights
[2:25:00.880 --> 2:25:02.880]  his letter from the Birmingham jail
[2:25:02.880 --> 2:25:04.880]  Martin said
[2:25:04.880 --> 2:25:06.880]  infanticide
[2:25:06.880 --> 2:25:08.880]  was evil
[2:25:08.880 --> 2:25:10.880]  Dr. King said that
[2:25:10.880 --> 2:25:12.880]  and he was talking to the church
[2:25:12.880 --> 2:25:14.880]  he said the early church put away
[2:25:14.880 --> 2:25:16.880]  such evils as gladiatorial
[2:25:16.880 --> 2:25:18.880]  contest that's another story
[2:25:18.880 --> 2:25:20.880]  and infanticide
[2:25:20.880 --> 2:25:22.880]  where at the demise
[2:25:22.880 --> 2:25:24.880]  of Rome they actually had a law
[2:25:24.880 --> 2:25:26.880]  that you can place a child
[2:25:26.880 --> 2:25:28.880]  by the side of the road to dive
[2:25:28.880 --> 2:25:30.880]  the child's hair color, skin color
[2:25:30.880 --> 2:25:32.880]  whatever the reason
[2:25:32.880 --> 2:25:34.880]  you were basically able
[2:25:34.880 --> 2:25:36.880]  to put the child by the side of the road to dive
[2:25:36.880 --> 2:25:38.880]  but the early church
[2:25:38.880 --> 2:25:40.880]  scooped those children up
[2:25:40.880 --> 2:25:42.880]  and raised them at the threat of death
[2:25:42.880 --> 2:25:44.880]  each day of their lives
[2:25:44.880 --> 2:25:46.880]  therefore
[2:25:46.880 --> 2:25:48.880]  so no question
[2:25:48.880 --> 2:25:50.880]  I say to the African American audience
[2:25:50.880 --> 2:25:52.880]  and so many that hold
[2:25:52.880 --> 2:25:54.880]  his life and his teachings
[2:25:54.880 --> 2:25:56.880]  dear
[2:25:56.880 --> 2:25:58.880]  all the lever on infanticide
[2:25:58.880 --> 2:26:00.880]  they are literally
[2:26:00.880 --> 2:26:02.880]  it's satanic, it's demonic
[2:26:02.880 --> 2:26:04.880]  well that was my next question
[2:26:04.880 --> 2:26:06.880]  you went to the history
[2:26:06.880 --> 2:26:08.880]  every culture before it collapses
[2:26:08.880 --> 2:26:10.880]  whether it was in Asia, Africa
[2:26:10.880 --> 2:26:12.880]  Latin America did it
[2:26:12.880 --> 2:26:14.880]  back when it was Mesoamerica
[2:26:14.880 --> 2:26:16.880]  people start sacrificing children
[2:26:16.880 --> 2:26:18.880]  it's satan
[2:26:18.880 --> 2:26:20.880]  there's a hunger, a spiritual drive
[2:26:20.880 --> 2:26:22.880]  that wants to do this, why?
[2:26:22.880 --> 2:26:24.880]  you really can't describe it any other way
[2:26:24.880 --> 2:26:26.880]  in images
[2:26:26.880 --> 2:26:28.880]  or persons that are made in God's image
[2:26:28.880 --> 2:26:30.880]  but from almost
[2:26:30.880 --> 2:26:32.880]  from just outside the garden
[2:26:32.880 --> 2:26:34.880]  satan has demanded
[2:26:34.880 --> 2:26:36.880]  a blood sacrifice to him
[2:26:36.880 --> 2:26:38.880]  it increases their power
[2:26:38.880 --> 2:26:40.880]  their status
[2:26:40.880 --> 2:26:42.880]  I don't want to get into all those spiritual things here
[2:26:42.880 --> 2:26:44.880]  but trust me
[2:26:44.880 --> 2:26:46.880]  look at history
[2:26:46.880 --> 2:26:48.880]  evil always morphs
[2:26:48.880 --> 2:26:50.880]  its way into each society
[2:26:50.880 --> 2:26:52.880]  to
[2:26:52.880 --> 2:26:54.880]  sacrifice
[2:26:54.880 --> 2:26:56.880]  or to mutilate or to kill
[2:26:56.880 --> 2:26:58.880]  innocents or the children
[2:26:58.880 --> 2:27:00.880]  in the womb
[2:27:00.880 --> 2:27:02.880]  that's the cost of admission to satan
[2:27:02.880 --> 2:27:04.880]  who still has dominion over the earth
[2:27:04.880 --> 2:27:06.880]  the principalities of the era
[2:27:06.880 --> 2:27:08.880]  that's the admission fee
[2:27:08.880 --> 2:27:10.880]  torturing little babies
[2:27:10.880 --> 2:27:12.880]  that's why how the church
[2:27:12.880 --> 2:27:14.880]  could ever be opposing
[2:27:14.880 --> 2:27:16.880]  the agenda of Donald Trump
[2:27:16.880 --> 2:27:18.880]  how the church could ever
[2:27:18.880 --> 2:27:20.880]  be talking about his decorum
[2:27:20.880 --> 2:27:22.880]  this man is really trying to put an end
[2:27:22.880 --> 2:27:24.880]  to Beth from it as you
[2:27:24.880 --> 2:27:26.880]  depict there, he's trying to put an end
[2:27:26.880 --> 2:27:28.880]  to the child's sacrifice
[2:27:28.880 --> 2:27:30.880]  and America is going to
[2:27:30.880 --> 2:27:32.880]  it is America's most egregious sin
[2:27:32.880 --> 2:27:34.880]  you just said it
[2:27:34.880 --> 2:27:36.880]  you judge a tree by its fruits
[2:27:36.880 --> 2:27:38.880]  God rose up all kings
[2:27:38.880 --> 2:27:40.880]  corrupt kings, good kings, middle of the road
[2:27:40.880 --> 2:27:42.880]  King David did bad things, God forgave him
[2:27:42.880 --> 2:27:44.880]  doesn't matter, Trump clearly has the devil mad at him
[2:27:44.880 --> 2:27:46.880]  I mean Trump's got the whole world
[2:27:46.880 --> 2:27:48.880]  going crazy
[2:27:48.880 --> 2:27:50.880]  absolutely, he's God's
[2:27:50.880 --> 2:27:52.880]  man for this time
[2:27:52.880 --> 2:27:54.880]  he is prophetic, he
[2:27:54.880 --> 2:27:56.880]  he's our Cyrus so to speak
[2:27:56.880 --> 2:27:58.880]  he is going to make the
[2:27:58.880 --> 2:28:00.880]  attempt to restore
[2:28:00.880 --> 2:28:02.880]  America back to its virtue
[2:28:02.880 --> 2:28:04.880]  and one of the things he is clear about
[2:28:04.880 --> 2:28:06.880]  if anything in the social
[2:28:06.880 --> 2:28:08.880]  strata of things is
[2:28:08.880 --> 2:28:10.880]  abortion, he's been the clearest
[2:28:10.880 --> 2:28:12.880]  I believe that it soon
[2:28:12.880 --> 2:28:14.880]  will happen that the child
[2:28:14.880 --> 2:28:16.880]  sacrifice will go back
[2:28:16.880 --> 2:28:18.880]  to the states probably
[2:28:18.880 --> 2:28:20.880]  but just for the government to make a stand
[2:28:20.880 --> 2:28:22.880]  to diminish
[2:28:22.880 --> 2:28:24.880]  or do away with Roe vs. Wade
[2:28:24.880 --> 2:28:26.880]  would unquestionably hurt
[2:28:26.880 --> 2:28:28.880]  the deep state
[2:28:28.880 --> 2:28:30.880]  because they are determined to have
[2:28:30.880 --> 2:28:32.880]  abortion as a means of social engineering
[2:28:32.880 --> 2:28:34.880]  that is global
[2:28:34.880 --> 2:28:36.880]  and that's one level as you know, it's a sacrament
[2:28:36.880 --> 2:28:38.880]  you always get into the history and that's great and you're an expert
[2:28:38.880 --> 2:28:40.880]  that's what we have you on, you know more than I do
[2:28:40.880 --> 2:28:42.880]  but we should probably get into the spiritual, we've never really done that here
[2:28:42.880 --> 2:28:44.880]  because that's what's behind all this
[2:28:44.880 --> 2:28:46.880]  so thanks for being with us my friend
[2:28:46.880 --> 2:28:48.880]  be sure to visit the site blackgenocide.org
[2:28:48.880 --> 2:28:50.880]  and share that link, if you don't
[2:28:50.880 --> 2:28:52.880]  who will
[2:28:52.880 --> 2:28:54.880]  attention GCN
[2:28:54.880 --> 2:28:56.880]  self reliance listeners
[2:28:56.880 --> 2:28:58.880]  if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival
[2:28:58.880 --> 2:29:00.880]  backup system but were waiting for prices
[2:29:00.880 --> 2:29:02.880]  too crazy to pass up
[2:29:02.880 --> 2:29:04.880]  this will be the most important message you'll ever hear
[2:29:04.880 --> 2:29:06.880]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale
[2:29:06.880 --> 2:29:08.880]  with historically low prices
[2:29:08.880 --> 2:29:10.880]  on our PPX microgrid system
[2:29:10.880 --> 2:29:12.880]  that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity
[2:29:12.880 --> 2:29:14.880]  off the grid
[2:29:14.880 --> 2:29:16.880]  the clearance price is a result of the historic flooding
[2:29:16.880 --> 2:29:18.880]  we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi
[2:29:18.880 --> 2:29:20.880]  because of the flooding
[2:29:20.880 --> 2:29:22.880]  we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[2:29:22.880 --> 2:29:24.880]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse
[2:29:24.880 --> 2:29:26.880]  we thought we'd offer the system
[2:29:26.880 --> 2:29:28.880]  at a price that might seem unbelievable
[2:29:28.880 --> 2:29:30.880]  if you didn't know the flood water's backstory
[2:29:30.880 --> 2:29:32.880]  so here's what you should do right now
[2:29:32.880 --> 2:29:34.880]  check out the PPX microgrid system

[2:29:40.880 --> 2:29:42.880]  off the grid gear
[2:29:42.880 --> 2:29:44.880]  and a ton of bonuses too
[2:29:44.880 --> 2:29:46.880]  in the best part you're not going to pay $750
[2:29:46.880 --> 2:29:48.880]  or $500 or even $200
[2:29:48.880 --> 2:29:50.880]  go to myownpowergrid.com

[2:29:56.880 --> 2:29:58.880]  that are a sure bet
[2:29:58.880 --> 2:30:00.880]  but I'm here to tell you
[2:30:00.880 --> 2:30:02.880]  the products that in FullWarsLife.com are
[2:30:02.880 --> 2:30:04.880]  we go out, we find out
[2:30:04.880 --> 2:30:06.880]  what is the best rated, best tested

[2:30:14.880 --> 2:30:16.880]  even better and lower the price
[2:30:16.880 --> 2:30:18.880]  now turmeric has been known for thousands of years
[2:30:18.880 --> 2:30:20.880]  to help with inflammation, headaches
[2:30:20.880 --> 2:30:22.880]  it's good for the immune system
[2:30:22.880 --> 2:30:24.880]  so many things, it sells itself
[2:30:24.880 --> 2:30:26.880]  but normal turmeric
[2:30:26.880 --> 2:30:28.880]  only has 3-5% curcuminoid
[2:30:28.880 --> 2:30:30.880]  the active
[2:30:30.880 --> 2:30:32.880]  enzyme or system in the plant
[2:30:32.880 --> 2:30:34.880]  originally obviously from India
[2:30:34.880 --> 2:30:36.880]  well
[2:30:36.880 --> 2:30:38.880]  the turmeric formula has a 95%
[2:30:38.880 --> 2:30:40.880]  curcuminoid level
[2:30:40.880 --> 2:30:42.880]  and it's got other natural things that help boost it
[2:30:42.880 --> 2:30:44.880]  help your body absorb it
[2:30:44.880 --> 2:30:46.880]  and that's why people absolutely love it

[2:31:06.880 --> 2:31:08.880]  and let us private label it
[2:31:08.880 --> 2:31:10.880]  in the last 2 years it's been a best seller
[2:31:10.880 --> 2:31:12.880]  we convinced them to let us
[2:31:12.880 --> 2:31:14.880]  come out with a skin cream
[2:31:14.880 --> 2:31:16.880]  that basically mimics the top skin creams
[2:31:16.880 --> 2:31:18.880]  that are already out there
[2:31:18.880 --> 2:31:20.880]  at a lower price with their patented silver salt
[2:31:20.880 --> 2:31:22.880]  technology in it

[2:31:36.880 --> 2:31:38.880]  you're not going to find a product that's good anywhere
[2:31:38.880 --> 2:31:40.880]  you're certainly not going to find it at this price
[2:31:40.880 --> 2:31:42.880]  and it funds the info war
[2:31:42.880 --> 2:31:44.880]  at infowarslife.com

[2:31:48.880 --> 2:31:50.880]  for another week or so
[2:31:50.880 --> 2:31:52.880]  as I'm taping this September 10th
[2:31:52.880 --> 2:31:54.880]  as I said here
[2:31:54.880 --> 2:31:56.880]  recording this on the eve of September 11th
[2:31:56.880 --> 2:31:58.880]  2019
[2:31:58.880 --> 2:32:00.880]  and I look back to that tragic event
[2:32:00.880 --> 2:32:02.880]  18 years ago
[2:32:02.880 --> 2:32:04.880]  it makes me sick to my stomach
[2:32:04.880 --> 2:32:06.880]  to be vindicated and have the fire department
[2:32:06.880 --> 2:32:08.880]  of New York and
[2:32:08.880 --> 2:32:10.880]  major construction
[2:32:10.880 --> 2:32:12.880]  and engineering firms come out
[2:32:12.880 --> 2:32:14.880]  and confirm that bombs
[2:32:14.880 --> 2:32:16.880]  were in tower 1, tower 2
[2:32:16.880 --> 2:32:18.880]  and of course building 7
[2:32:18.880 --> 2:32:20.880]  and the then FBI
[2:32:20.880 --> 2:32:22.880]  director Robert Muller
[2:32:22.880 --> 2:32:24.880]  helped cover the whole thing up
[2:32:24.880 --> 2:32:26.880]  with the Saudis and to know that there's a
[2:32:26.880 --> 2:32:28.880]  deep state group
[2:32:28.880 --> 2:32:30.880]  within our government
[2:32:30.880 --> 2:32:32.880]  with radical Islam
[2:32:32.880 --> 2:32:34.880]  who are using the threat of Islamic terror
[2:32:34.880 --> 2:32:36.880]  to take our basic liberties and freedoms
[2:32:36.880 --> 2:32:38.880]  while empowering and funding radical Islam
[2:32:38.880 --> 2:32:40.880]  to take over the planet
[2:32:40.880 --> 2:32:42.880]  well 18 years later I'm here to tell you
[2:32:42.880 --> 2:32:44.880]  that the world is awakened in 9-11
[2:32:44.880 --> 2:32:46.880]  and info wars and our researchers
[2:32:46.880 --> 2:32:48.880]  and our guests and our whistleblowers
[2:32:48.880 --> 2:32:50.880]  have been vindicated yet again
[2:32:50.880 --> 2:33:02.880]  Tom is more important than ever
[2:33:20.880 --> 2:33:23.360]  listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:23.360 --> 2:33:39.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to invite Reverend Childress back on the room with Owen Schreuer
[2:33:39.200 --> 2:33:43.760]  back on Firepower Will Johnson back home with David Knight because, you know, years
[2:33:43.760 --> 2:33:44.960]  go by like seconds now.
[2:33:44.960 --> 2:33:47.680]  We probably only have this gentleman on like once a year.
[2:33:47.680 --> 2:33:53.080]  We promote and sell one of his films exposing the, you know, roots of all this racism and
[2:33:53.080 --> 2:33:55.760]  all this eugenics evil that's been shown to Congress.
[2:33:55.760 --> 2:34:00.080]  And all the statistics show upwards of 75 percent of young people are against abortion
[2:34:00.080 --> 2:34:01.080]  now.
[2:34:01.080 --> 2:34:02.640]  As he said, national polls, 60 percent.
[2:34:02.640 --> 2:34:03.640]  Those polls are manipulated.
[2:34:03.640 --> 2:34:05.080]  It's way higher than that.
[2:34:05.080 --> 2:34:11.760]  And as the conscience sees this happening, they're trying to make our heart hard as the
[2:34:11.760 --> 2:34:13.040]  Bible talks about.
[2:34:13.040 --> 2:34:17.000]  And this is real.
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:19.880]  And we're being taught it's a post-human world and to hate ourselves.
[2:34:19.880 --> 2:34:24.280]  And the left is in WikiLeaks trying to create racial division and cultural division.
[2:34:24.280 --> 2:34:26.720]  This is all to bring us down.
[2:34:26.720 --> 2:34:31.000]  And so there couldn't be a more important topic to cover and discuss here.
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:36.680]  So Reverend, getting into what you think is most important to impart to the listeners,
[2:34:36.680 --> 2:34:37.680]  this is a great audience.
[2:34:37.680 --> 2:34:38.680]  They're the salt of the earth.
[2:34:38.680 --> 2:34:42.640]  I think the biggest message is they need to reach out to others to get them to understand
[2:34:42.640 --> 2:34:43.640]  what's happening.
[2:34:43.640 --> 2:34:44.640]  They need to share this interview.
[2:34:44.640 --> 2:34:47.600]  They need to share that report we just showed earlier that's so powerful.
[2:34:47.600 --> 2:34:48.600]  We need to expose this.
[2:34:48.600 --> 2:34:52.080]  Sure, it's more fun to go watch a football game or go to the movies.
[2:34:52.080 --> 2:34:53.080]  But you know what?
[2:34:53.080 --> 2:34:57.080]  I mean, I don't want to say I feel guilty, but I do.
[2:34:57.080 --> 2:34:58.800]  I know they're keeping babies alive.
[2:34:58.800 --> 2:35:02.420]  I know what hospitals to wait while the orders come in for their organs.
[2:35:02.420 --> 2:35:04.440]  And then I feel bad that I'm not protesting outside.
[2:35:04.440 --> 2:35:08.760]  I mean, I'm doing it on air, but we need to have our heart convicted to really do something
[2:35:08.760 --> 2:35:13.040]  because if we don't stand up for them, none of our lives are going to be protected as
[2:35:13.040 --> 2:35:14.040]  well.
[2:35:14.040 --> 2:35:15.040]  Where is the empathy?
[2:35:15.040 --> 2:35:18.600]  Where is the common sense that if this can happen to babies and they can be euthanizing
[2:35:18.600 --> 2:35:21.200]  old people, none of us are safe?
[2:35:21.200 --> 2:35:22.600]  None.
[2:35:22.600 --> 2:35:25.280]  And this is what I've talked about spiritually.
[2:35:25.280 --> 2:35:29.080]  The line right now is drawn in the sand, America.
[2:35:29.080 --> 2:35:33.360]  And no question that we can ever say that we did not know.
[2:35:33.360 --> 2:35:41.040]  Our elected officials have told you what they're doing through the efforts of David
[2:35:41.040 --> 2:35:44.560]  DeLion and others, Mr. O'Keefe.
[2:35:44.560 --> 2:35:47.020]  We know they're selling body parts.
[2:35:47.020 --> 2:35:49.440]  We know they're in it for a business.
[2:35:49.440 --> 2:35:51.040]  We know it's lucrative.
[2:35:51.040 --> 2:35:57.040]  We know now it is MOLA, unquestionably manifested here in the land of the free and the home
[2:35:57.040 --> 2:35:58.400]  of the brave.
[2:35:58.400 --> 2:36:02.360]  And so whenever sin is exposed like this.
[2:36:02.360 --> 2:36:09.040]  Or it was, we knew about it, but it wasn't as blatant, it wasn't as public.
[2:36:09.040 --> 2:36:12.120]  And it's basically now documented.
[2:36:12.120 --> 2:36:16.440]  And so we have the attacks on those who will carry the message.
[2:36:16.440 --> 2:36:20.440]  They have attacks on Infowars and Alex Jones.
[2:36:20.440 --> 2:36:27.400]  Even my website and my name now is basically being censored from the information that we've
[2:36:27.400 --> 2:36:28.640]  been carrying.
[2:36:28.640 --> 2:36:33.840]  And so no doubt we're at the crossroads, the line is drawn in the sand.
[2:36:33.840 --> 2:36:38.440]  And America, I appeal to America, the killing must stop.
[2:36:38.440 --> 2:36:40.840]  The killing of the innocent must stop.
[2:36:40.840 --> 2:36:43.560]  The sacrifice of babies to MOLA must stop.
[2:36:43.560 --> 2:36:51.160]  One of the things they would do when they were sacrificing babies, the drummers would
[2:36:51.160 --> 2:36:55.240]  beat the drums so loud that you could not hear the child scream.
[2:36:55.240 --> 2:36:59.960]  So in other words, they were trying to desensitize conscience.
[2:36:59.960 --> 2:37:02.680]  That's exactly what's going on right now.
[2:37:02.680 --> 2:37:03.680]  You mentioned it.
[2:37:03.680 --> 2:37:06.840]  They're trying to say to us, this is okay.
[2:37:06.840 --> 2:37:08.520]  This should be a part of life.
[2:37:08.520 --> 2:37:12.720]  This should be a decision that a woman makes about her own body.
[2:37:12.720 --> 2:37:17.720]  Of course, I've always said it's intellectually dishonest to claim a right for yourself and
[2:37:17.720 --> 2:37:21.720]  then so doing, taking away the right of someone else.
[2:37:21.720 --> 2:37:28.240]  But right now, they're backed up against the corner, if I may want to interject also.
[2:37:28.240 --> 2:37:29.520]  And you've already stated it.
[2:37:29.520 --> 2:37:32.480]  We are winning the battle of the debate.
[2:37:32.480 --> 2:37:40.440]  And so they are even more determined to destroy this president and destroy his agenda, destroy
[2:37:40.440 --> 2:37:47.040]  anything that reflects his agenda meeting, especially the pro-life message.
[2:37:47.040 --> 2:37:52.200]  Now recently, and you do this probably better than anybody, but you've got to understand,
[2:37:52.200 --> 2:37:56.320]  they have about a year to turn these numbers around.
[2:37:56.320 --> 2:37:58.480]  So I'm expecting race wars.
[2:37:58.480 --> 2:38:05.520]  I'm expecting any type of scheme or scam to destroy this president.
[2:38:05.520 --> 2:38:08.360]  He won with 8% of the black vote.
[2:38:08.360 --> 2:38:09.560]  He won.
[2:38:09.560 --> 2:38:14.000]  Right now, the lowest numbers I'm hearing, he's at 24%.
[2:38:14.000 --> 2:38:17.280]  The Hispanic vote, he won, I think, with 29%.
[2:38:17.280 --> 2:38:21.360]  Well, now he's winning with 49% to 52%.
[2:38:21.360 --> 2:38:28.000]  They may not be saying anything, but their strategists know landslide next year if these
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:30.080]  numbers stay the same.
[2:38:30.080 --> 2:38:35.560]  I thank God he's held true to his word in his agenda.
[2:38:35.560 --> 2:38:37.560]  He's not a perfect man.
[2:38:37.560 --> 2:38:41.280]  And perhaps he wish he had done some other things better.
[2:38:41.280 --> 2:38:48.840]  But I'm telling you, I'm telling your audience, if a race war, a race attack, or something
[2:38:48.840 --> 2:38:52.120]  that revolves around race, because that's the only card they can ever do.
[2:38:52.120 --> 2:38:56.320]  Well, you know, they're winding up Antifa to go out and stage attacks on minorities,
[2:38:56.320 --> 2:39:00.680]  and then they cover up their social pages admitting they were Antifa, doing it to get
[2:39:00.680 --> 2:39:01.680]  our guns.
[2:39:01.680 --> 2:39:04.200]  And then in every case, they're actually Satanist.
[2:39:04.200 --> 2:39:08.360]  The guy in Texas and the guy in Ohio were both Satanists, and then they tried to cover
[2:39:08.360 --> 2:39:10.160]  it up.
[2:39:10.160 --> 2:39:16.480]  Satan has done everything he can, and always, no matter what tragedy goes around, no doubt,
[2:39:16.480 --> 2:39:17.560]  no question about it.
[2:39:17.560 --> 2:39:23.840]  In every society, when you have legalized killing of the innocent, when the sanctity
[2:39:23.840 --> 2:39:30.600]  of life has been basically denounced or denied, it's placed in the consciousness of that
[2:39:30.600 --> 2:39:31.600]  government.
[2:39:31.600 --> 2:39:38.320]  Yes, you're going to have upheavals, you're going to have man's inhumanity to man.
[2:39:38.320 --> 2:39:43.200]  But I just want to say to your audience, keep pressing, be out in the public as much as
[2:39:43.200 --> 2:39:44.700]  you can.
[2:39:44.700 --> 2:39:47.240]  Right now, they're up against the ropes.
[2:39:47.240 --> 2:39:52.840]  I believe we're going to get a knockout punch soon, but it's going to appear just as the
[2:39:52.840 --> 2:39:58.840]  montage you played, which was excellent, it's going to make you to believe, since these
[2:39:58.840 --> 2:40:02.880]  persons condone this, you should too.
[2:40:02.880 --> 2:40:03.880]  And you should.
[2:40:03.880 --> 2:40:04.880]  Exactly.
[2:40:04.880 --> 2:40:06.000]  They're flaunting it like it's no big deal.
[2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:10.640]  Yeah, we love to kill babies for fun, yeah, they are babies, hoping that just desensitizes
[2:40:10.640 --> 2:40:14.400]  us instead of the other, or hoping it demoralizes us, but let me raise this point since you
[2:40:14.400 --> 2:40:17.280]  get into that.
[2:40:17.280 --> 2:40:21.640]  They admit, and they are pushing, and so we should talk about the numbers.
[2:40:21.640 --> 2:40:25.400]  How many abortions, I know a bunch of states don't report it, but the best numbers we have,
[2:40:25.400 --> 2:40:29.560]  how many people have been aborted since Roe v. Wade, and how many of them were black?
[2:40:29.560 --> 2:40:33.400]  Because that just neutralizes all the lies, you know, that it trumps the white supremacists
[2:40:33.400 --> 2:40:37.120]  and all this ridiculous crap, when the real litmus test is are you for abortion or not?
[2:40:37.120 --> 2:40:41.280]  That's the Planned Parenthood, the real proto-Nazis, that's where the Nazis, as you know, and
[2:40:41.280 --> 2:40:42.960]  have written about, got the ideas.
[2:40:42.960 --> 2:40:46.840]  So I'm going to talk about real numbers here, when, when you know they're going to stage
[2:40:46.840 --> 2:40:50.280]  some deal shooting a black church up the week before the election, I mean, and the guys
[2:40:50.280 --> 2:40:51.280]  will be a Trump supporter.
[2:40:51.280 --> 2:40:52.280]  We all know.
[2:40:52.280 --> 2:40:54.080]  So, okay, 24 black people get killed.
[2:40:54.080 --> 2:40:59.680]  What about 10 million black babies, you see, so we need to get that out in people's minds.
[2:40:59.680 --> 2:41:06.600]  It's 21 million, 21 million African-Americans since Roe v. Wade, and I look at everybody's
[2:41:06.600 --> 2:41:11.480]  numbers and that is, that is a moderate, and what's the total?
[2:41:11.480 --> 2:41:13.240]  Is it 60 million people total?
[2:41:13.240 --> 2:41:17.640]  Yeah, just over 60 now, just recently, just over 60 million.
[2:41:17.640 --> 2:41:24.880]  And so you have African-Americans at 12.4% of the population having 36% of the abortions,
[2:41:24.880 --> 2:41:30.400]  52% of all African-American pregnancies end in abortions, that's their numbers.
[2:41:30.400 --> 2:41:33.160]  That's not a few research or some Christian rule.
[2:41:33.160 --> 2:41:36.520]  So when the global stage blowing up a black church or something, we're very sad, but that's
[2:41:36.520 --> 2:41:39.200]  20 people, not 22 million.
[2:41:39.200 --> 2:41:40.920]  Absolutely.
[2:41:40.920 --> 2:41:46.640]  You mentioned all the time, where's the attention on Chicago, Philadelphia, with, where, and
[2:41:46.640 --> 2:41:52.240]  literally every weekend, you know, sometimes I'm stunned to hear these numbers on a weekend.
[2:41:52.240 --> 2:41:53.740]  Thousands of deaths a year.
[2:41:53.740 --> 2:41:57.960]  And I'm saying to myself, where is our leaders?
[2:41:57.960 --> 2:41:59.800]  Where's the march on Chicago?
[2:41:59.800 --> 2:42:05.200]  Where's the march on Philly for the violence, the black on black crime and violence that
[2:42:05.200 --> 2:42:11.840]  is unquestionably just, it really destroying the culture of African-Americans and the mindset
[2:42:11.840 --> 2:42:12.840]  of our young people.
[2:42:12.840 --> 2:42:15.080]  And any racial attacks are terrible.
[2:42:15.080 --> 2:42:18.920]  What I'm saying is they're going to distract us from their main operation by provocaturing
[2:42:18.920 --> 2:42:20.440]  and staging events they've been caught.
[2:42:20.440 --> 2:42:23.920]  Trevor and shoulders, thank you for the time, God bless you, blackgenocide.org.
[2:42:23.920 --> 2:42:27.160]  Please come join us for a full hour and take calls very soon, and please come on the other
[2:42:27.160 --> 2:42:28.160]  shows.
[2:42:28.160 --> 2:42:29.160]  Not a problem.
[2:42:29.160 --> 2:42:30.160]  God bless you.
[2:42:30.160 --> 2:42:31.160]  God bless you.
[2:42:31.160 --> 2:42:32.160]  All right.
[2:42:32.160 --> 2:42:33.160]  When we come back, he just mentioned it.
[2:42:33.160 --> 2:42:34.160]  That's what we're getting to.
[2:42:34.160 --> 2:42:38.120]  They're going to try to cause a civil war with the gun confiscations.
[2:42:38.120 --> 2:42:39.120]  That's their plan.
[2:42:39.120 --> 2:42:40.120]  They know it's going to cause that.
[2:42:40.120 --> 2:42:41.360]  How do we defeat it?
[2:42:41.360 --> 2:42:43.200]  I know how to beat it.
[2:42:43.200 --> 2:42:44.520]  This is serious when we come back.
[2:42:44.520 --> 2:42:49.720]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com and newswars.com, but whatever you do, seriously, we can win
[2:42:49.720 --> 2:42:54.080]  this fight if you spread the word, so thank you for doing that.
[2:42:54.080 --> 2:42:57.760]  There are few things in this universe that are assured of that, but I'm here to tell
[2:42:57.760 --> 2:43:01.440]  you the products that infowars.com are.
[2:43:01.440 --> 2:43:09.000]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested, most loved, most documented substances
[2:43:09.000 --> 2:43:14.000]  that God gave us to Mother Nature, and then we make it even stronger, even better, and
[2:43:14.000 --> 2:43:15.000]  lower the price.
[2:43:15.000 --> 2:43:19.600]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches,
[2:43:19.600 --> 2:43:21.840]  it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[2:43:21.840 --> 2:43:30.480]  It sells itself, but normal turmeric only has 3 to 5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or
[2:43:30.480 --> 2:43:34.280]  system in the plant, originally obviously from India.
[2:43:34.280 --> 2:43:40.720]  Well, body's ultimate turmeric formula has a 95% curcuminoid level, but it's got other
[2:43:40.720 --> 2:43:45.360]  natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it, and that's why people absolutely
[2:43:45.360 --> 2:43:46.360]  love it.
[2:43:46.360 --> 2:43:52.880]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet, 50% off on bodies at infowars.com.
[2:43:52.880 --> 2:43:57.120]  We sold Secret 12 for 4 years, and it was our number third best seller.
[2:43:57.120 --> 2:44:02.000]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[2:44:02.000 --> 2:44:07.200]  That new formula is Ultra 12, it's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very best vitamin
[2:44:07.200 --> 2:44:12.360]  B12 out there, it's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it, and it does

[2:44:21.120 --> 2:44:22.520]  functioning, goes on and on.
[2:44:22.520 --> 2:44:26.480]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that could cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation,
[2:44:26.480 --> 2:44:30.800]  weight loss, depression, or memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.

[2:44:54.560 --> 2:45:00.320]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffree Epstein was running a giant governmental
[2:45:00.320 --> 2:45:03.120]  blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[2:45:03.120 --> 2:45:07.800]  I was the first to warn of human animal hybrids and organ harvesting.
[2:45:07.800 --> 2:45:12.560]  I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born
[2:45:12.560 --> 2:45:15.160]  for their organs to be harvested.
[2:45:15.160 --> 2:45:20.280]  I was the first to warn you along with Paul Watson at infowars.com, 15 years ago that
[2:45:20.280 --> 2:45:25.520]  Google was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do, and hundreds
[2:45:25.520 --> 2:45:31.960]  and hundreds of other giant issues, like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit,
[2:45:31.960 --> 2:45:33.720]  trying to control our economy.
[2:45:33.720 --> 2:45:37.440]  That our government in Hollywood have been taken over by the Communist Chinese on every
[2:45:37.440 --> 2:45:39.960]  one of these issues and many others.
[2:45:39.960 --> 2:45:43.920]  We've been dead on, and we've raised the alarm on the planetary scale.
[2:45:43.920 --> 2:45:48.680]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down, and that's why you are more critical
[2:45:48.680 --> 2:45:50.720]  than ever to support the info war.
[2:45:50.720 --> 2:45:54.720]  Please support the info war however you can.
[2:45:54.720 --> 2:46:00.560]  Super Silver Woon Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S. that has their
[2:46:00.560 --> 2:46:05.000]  products and hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[2:46:05.000 --> 2:46:08.080]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two
[2:46:08.080 --> 2:46:09.840]  years as been a best seller.
[2:46:09.840 --> 2:46:15.520]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top
[2:46:15.520 --> 2:46:20.400]  skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented SilverSol
[2:46:20.400 --> 2:46:21.880]  technology in it.
[2:46:21.880 --> 2:46:27.200]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the steric acid, it's got the grapefruit essential
[2:46:27.200 --> 2:46:31.480]  oil, it's got the nano silver, coconut oil and so much more.
[2:46:31.480 --> 2:46:37.040]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one you're
[2:46:37.040 --> 2:46:40.160]  not going to find a product that's good anywhere and you're certainly not going to find it
[2:46:40.160 --> 2:46:45.120]  at this price and it funds the info war at infowarslife.com.
[2:46:45.120 --> 2:46:49.880]  Get your super silver skin cream today, we can only run this special for another week
[2:46:49.880 --> 2:46:57.840]  or so as I'm taping this September 10th.
[2:46:57.840 --> 2:47:26.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:27.840 --> 2:47:36.440]  Well, my friends, they've thrown down the gauntlet, all the Democratic candidates and
[2:47:36.440 --> 2:47:40.720]  they're going to confiscate 90% of the guns from the U.S. and they're going to send SWAT
[2:47:40.720 --> 2:47:43.640]  teams to kill you if you don't turn them in.
[2:47:43.640 --> 2:47:47.560]  They don't even care if Congress passes it, they just say they'll have executive orders.
[2:47:47.560 --> 2:47:51.320]  Here's their leader, holding it 1% back to Aurora.
[2:47:51.320 --> 2:47:54.320]  Yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.
[2:47:54.320 --> 2:48:01.320]  We're not going to allow it to be used against fellow Americans anymore.
[2:48:01.320 --> 2:48:07.360]  Now, let's get into it right now.
[2:48:07.360 --> 2:48:10.800]  First off, we have to find this operation and then I'm going to tell you, I think you
[2:48:10.800 --> 2:48:14.440]  already have it figured out by better than I do, but later I propose you don't know.
[2:48:14.440 --> 2:48:17.320]  It's exactly what we're facing and how we can stop it.
[2:48:17.320 --> 2:48:22.960]  And when I say how we can stop it, I'm very blessed to be in this position and I'm not
[2:48:22.960 --> 2:48:24.280]  on the power trip, it's the opposite.
[2:48:24.280 --> 2:48:30.600]  I feel like I have great responsibility constantly and feel like I'm not acting at the level
[2:48:30.600 --> 2:48:31.600]  I should be.
[2:48:31.600 --> 2:48:36.800]  It's imagine a bunch of horses pulling a carriage and they're just got snot coming out and they're
[2:48:36.800 --> 2:48:41.040]  frothing and they're pulling up that hill, just wanting to jam their hooves in to get
[2:48:41.040 --> 2:48:42.040]  that thing up there.
[2:48:42.040 --> 2:48:46.120]  They're not on a power trip, they're pulling a heavy load and they've got a mission and
[2:48:46.120 --> 2:48:47.120]  they're committed.
[2:48:47.120 --> 2:48:49.920]  Well, that's who I am because I know who these people are.
[2:48:49.920 --> 2:48:55.840]  I've been face to face with them, my whole life, I just ran into weirdness after craziness
[2:48:55.840 --> 2:49:00.840]  after bizarreness like that film Cat's Eye.
[2:49:00.840 --> 2:49:07.040]  The whole movie is about the weird crazy things this one cat sees and it just gets crazier
[2:49:07.040 --> 2:49:08.040]  and crazier.
[2:49:08.040 --> 2:49:11.800]  Well, that's kind of been like my life is just the weird, weird stuff I ran into and
[2:49:11.800 --> 2:49:12.800]  I saw.
[2:49:12.800 --> 2:49:19.520]  Now I realize it was God training me, preparing me so that I would really know what was really
[2:49:19.520 --> 2:49:26.040]  going on because just one of the crazy things I've seen or done or that I ran into, most
[2:49:26.040 --> 2:49:29.360]  people might have had one of those things in their life and I'm not bragging about this,
[2:49:29.360 --> 2:49:36.240]  by the way, a lot of it was very traumatic, but I'm telling you, we know their plan and
[2:49:36.240 --> 2:49:37.240]  I know how to beat it.
[2:49:37.240 --> 2:49:39.640]  I think once you hear me talk about this, you're going to agree with me.
[2:49:39.640 --> 2:49:42.840]  In fact, most of you probably already thought this yourselves because we're on the same
[2:49:42.840 --> 2:49:43.840]  page.
[2:49:43.840 --> 2:49:46.520]  We're in, we're simpatico.
[2:49:46.520 --> 2:49:49.080]  It's off though, we got to fund this operation.
[2:49:49.080 --> 2:49:58.560]  I came in this morning and I said, Hey, everybody, what's a great Beto counter shirt like from
[2:49:58.560 --> 2:49:59.560]  our cold dead hands?
[2:49:59.560 --> 2:50:01.600]  I was like, how about from his cold dead hands?
[2:50:01.600 --> 2:50:04.240]  Well, I don't want to threaten him, but that's what's going to happen.
[2:50:04.240 --> 2:50:09.640]  You know, they try to take the guns of civil war.
[2:50:09.640 --> 2:50:12.680]  I mean, how do you do it?
[2:50:12.680 --> 2:50:19.520]  He's got a shirt out, he's selling saying, Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15s
[2:50:19.520 --> 2:50:21.520]  and all your other semi-autos.
[2:50:21.520 --> 2:50:26.080]  Well, one of my old friends, the guy that did security work for us, he called up this
[2:50:26.080 --> 2:50:30.480]  morning and said, in the middle of the show, he said, I just came up with this design.
[2:50:30.480 --> 2:50:35.760]  He's friends with Piper's Union on my veterans here in Central Texas that does the printing
[2:50:35.760 --> 2:50:36.760]  for us.
[2:50:36.760 --> 2:50:40.840]  He said, how about Beto not Beto not?
[2:50:40.840 --> 2:50:47.800]  It's a M4 or AR-15, a Texas star about it, but it's an Army star or whatever you'd like.
[2:50:47.800 --> 2:50:48.920]  And then Beto not.
[2:50:48.920 --> 2:50:50.920]  I want to do one too, an Army green.
[2:50:50.920 --> 2:50:55.760]  These are being printed, already being printed and on the back, oh, they already have an
[2:50:55.760 --> 2:50:56.760]  Army green.
[2:50:56.760 --> 2:50:57.760]  Go down there and click below.
[2:50:57.760 --> 2:50:58.760]  I guess they already did what I said.
[2:50:58.760 --> 2:51:03.480]  On the back, it says M4Wars.com, but click on that green one down there below.
[2:51:03.480 --> 2:51:04.920]  So we've already got it gray.
[2:51:04.920 --> 2:51:06.600]  We've already got it in Army green.
[2:51:06.600 --> 2:51:09.560]  We've got it in darker gray.
[2:51:09.560 --> 2:51:12.360]  And this needs to be a best seller.
[2:51:12.360 --> 2:51:15.400]  Exercise your first amendment in defense of the second or lose it.
[2:51:15.400 --> 2:51:22.480]  And it's a win-win because you're funding this operation that, again, I just want to
[2:51:22.480 --> 2:51:23.680]  reach more people.
[2:51:23.680 --> 2:51:24.680]  That's your word of mouth.
[2:51:24.680 --> 2:51:25.800]  And I just want to fund the operation.
[2:51:25.800 --> 2:51:26.800]  That's your support.
[2:51:26.800 --> 2:51:28.760]  Plus, you get great products you already need.
[2:51:28.760 --> 2:51:29.760]  Take action today.
[2:51:29.760 --> 2:51:33.480]  You know, they came out and were banning the Betsy Ross flag.
[2:51:33.480 --> 2:51:36.160]  We sold 10,000 of them.
[2:51:36.160 --> 2:51:37.160]  And that sounds like a lot of money.
[2:51:37.160 --> 2:51:39.480]  It's not to run this operation, but to put a lot of shirts on the streets.
[2:51:39.480 --> 2:51:40.480]  That's great.
[2:51:40.480 --> 2:51:41.480]  Thank you.
[2:51:41.480 --> 2:51:45.160]  We sold 7,000 of the Space Force shirt that spreads the word and it's a nice, comfortable,
[2:51:45.160 --> 2:51:46.160]  cool shirt.
[2:51:46.160 --> 2:51:48.400]  And fun.
[2:51:48.400 --> 2:51:52.960]  We sold 100,000 of the Hillary for Prison shirts, but I sold half of them at $5 it cost.
[2:51:52.960 --> 2:51:55.760]  These shirts cost more because they're nicer fabric.
[2:51:55.760 --> 2:51:59.280]  Spatial shirts like $12.
[2:51:59.280 --> 2:52:01.440]  The XXL is even more.
[2:52:01.440 --> 2:52:05.680]  So these are designer shirts that be $25, $35 in stores.
[2:52:05.680 --> 2:52:07.480]  I just want to move them.
[2:52:07.480 --> 2:52:10.360]  You know, the old days, we just had the more inexpensive shirts.
[2:52:10.360 --> 2:52:13.040]  They were still well-made, but they were more in a soft, just regular cotton.
[2:52:13.040 --> 2:52:14.360]  We still sell those.
[2:52:14.360 --> 2:52:18.880]  But just go to mforwardstore.com and get some of the apparel today to exercise your free
[2:52:18.880 --> 2:52:23.240]  speech in the third dimension, the cyberspace is so censored and spread the word.
[2:52:23.240 --> 2:52:24.640]  And again, I'm not bitching at you.
[2:52:24.640 --> 2:52:27.400]  I'm saying, don't you want to win this thing?
[2:52:27.400 --> 2:52:30.680]  You really want these globalists that are out in the open, throwing down the gauntlet.
[2:52:30.680 --> 2:52:31.680]  We're going to take your guns.
[2:52:31.680 --> 2:52:32.680]  Yeah, we're in the pedophilia.
[2:52:32.680 --> 2:52:34.120]  Yeah, we kill babies after the born.
[2:52:34.120 --> 2:52:35.600]  Yeah, we work for the chai comms.
[2:52:35.600 --> 2:52:37.600]  Yeah, America sucks.
[2:52:37.600 --> 2:52:40.760]  It's not like we're just one of the programs out there fighting them.
[2:52:40.760 --> 2:52:42.440]  We're the one that's got their number.
[2:52:42.440 --> 2:52:44.480]  They don't like our spirit.
[2:52:44.480 --> 2:52:52.080]  Because, believe me, it's the opposite of Satanism, and it may come off as aggressive
[2:52:52.080 --> 2:52:55.360]  and a little hateful sometimes because it's got, you know, that's the Holy Spirit shining
[2:52:55.360 --> 2:52:57.200]  through my dirty earth suit.
[2:52:57.200 --> 2:53:01.760]  And you know what, the truth is, really study the Bible and history.
[2:53:01.760 --> 2:53:03.240]  Most people got used to go after evil.
[2:53:03.240 --> 2:53:05.200]  We're not a bunch of candy asses.
[2:53:05.200 --> 2:53:06.200]  We're not up there.
[2:53:06.200 --> 2:53:09.840]  I'll tell you how holy they were all day long.
[2:53:09.840 --> 2:53:13.920]  So I'm not going to up here and put on some sweetsy act for people because I don't have
[2:53:13.920 --> 2:53:16.040]  the energy to do it.
[2:53:16.040 --> 2:53:17.040]  I can't be fake.
[2:53:17.040 --> 2:53:19.040]  I just don't have it in me.
[2:53:19.040 --> 2:53:24.400]  In fact, if anything, I just hold back just how really pissed off I am because let me tell
[2:53:24.400 --> 2:53:25.400]  you something.
[2:53:25.400 --> 2:53:29.080]  If you're not angry about what's happening, there's something wrong with you and I know
[2:53:29.080 --> 2:53:30.080]  you're pissed.
[2:53:30.080 --> 2:53:34.120]  But let's put that anger into action, legal, lawful action.
[2:53:34.120 --> 2:53:37.920]  And I'll tell you this, they know they're losing the information war and the spiritual
[2:53:37.920 --> 2:53:38.920]  war.
[2:53:38.920 --> 2:53:39.920]  They're gearing up for a physical war.
[2:53:39.920 --> 2:53:40.920]  So let's do this.
[2:53:40.920 --> 2:53:44.760]  Let's not do anything offensive.
[2:53:44.760 --> 2:53:54.960]  But let's reconnoiter ourselves and let's look around and let's not do any talking.
[2:53:54.960 --> 2:53:56.760]  Let's just get prepared.
[2:53:56.760 --> 2:53:58.360]  And we know who the globalists are.
[2:53:58.360 --> 2:54:00.080]  We know who their minions are.
[2:54:00.080 --> 2:54:04.000]  And if they want to start a fight and want to go physical, they're going to get one.
[2:54:04.000 --> 2:54:07.400]  Now, before that happens, they're going to blow up a bunch of stuff and stage more mass
[2:54:07.400 --> 2:54:08.400]  shootings.
[2:54:08.400 --> 2:54:12.800]  And by the way, both guys were antifa, not just the guy in Ohio.
[2:54:12.800 --> 2:54:14.320]  Both were devil worshipers.
[2:54:14.320 --> 2:54:16.240]  We went and looked at what they took down off social media.
[2:54:16.240 --> 2:54:17.240]  They never denied.
[2:54:17.240 --> 2:54:19.800]  They took it off and said he was a Trump supporter and a right winger.
[2:54:19.800 --> 2:54:27.080]  The guy was an environmentalist, black trench coat wearing jerk off who couldn't get girls.
[2:54:27.080 --> 2:54:33.360]  He was another incel that's programmed by this culture.
[2:54:33.360 --> 2:54:39.640]  And so was the slob in Ohio.
[2:54:39.640 --> 2:54:41.040]  They're the same people.
[2:54:41.040 --> 2:54:44.120]  They got that look in their eye like they love themselves or on a power trip.
[2:54:44.120 --> 2:54:45.120]  They live in their mother's basement.
[2:54:45.120 --> 2:54:46.800]  A lot of people live in their mother's basement.
[2:54:46.800 --> 2:54:47.800]  Take care of their mother.
[2:54:47.800 --> 2:54:48.800]  I'm not saying you're bad.
[2:54:48.800 --> 2:54:49.800]  You live in your mother's basement.
[2:54:49.800 --> 2:54:50.800]  I'm not saying you're bad if you like to wear black.
[2:54:50.800 --> 2:54:51.800]  Johnny Cash did.
[2:54:51.800 --> 2:54:53.760]  When I'm overweight, I like to wear all black.
[2:54:53.760 --> 2:54:57.720]  I'm just saying the M.O. of these guys, shoot them up video games.
[2:54:57.720 --> 2:54:59.680]  Normal people doesn't hurt you to play those.
[2:54:59.680 --> 2:55:04.720]  But if you're a mentally ill person, devil worshiping, and in a rock band that promotes
[2:55:04.720 --> 2:55:11.000]  pedophilia, oh yeah, these guys are all the same.
[2:55:11.000 --> 2:55:20.000]  Almost every shooter that does this is a devil worshiping punk.
[2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:23.840]  So I said I'd get to the big enchilada, and I can always go into long pontifications.
[2:55:23.840 --> 2:55:28.800]  But what's left of this segment and the next segment, let me just get to it.
[2:55:28.800 --> 2:55:32.920]  The globalists know they're losing the information war.
[2:55:32.920 --> 2:55:38.280]  It's about all their censorship, all their bullying, it's backfiring.
[2:55:38.280 --> 2:55:40.360]  They were bullying before we were asleep.
[2:55:40.360 --> 2:55:43.680]  They think there's just not enough bullying now that we're not intimidated.
[2:55:43.680 --> 2:55:47.320]  See, they have that fundamental, because they're a bunch of followers.
[2:55:47.320 --> 2:55:50.400]  They are intimidated, most of them.
[2:55:50.400 --> 2:55:52.560]  So they keep thinking, man, we're just not bullying them enough.
[2:55:52.560 --> 2:55:53.560]  They're not submitting it.
[2:55:53.560 --> 2:55:56.000]  We were asleep, dumbass.
[2:55:56.000 --> 2:56:02.320]  You think flapping us in the face and pissing on us now that we're awake makes us scared?
[2:56:02.320 --> 2:56:05.240]  You think death threatening us makes us scared?
[2:56:05.240 --> 2:56:11.280]  So let me just get this straight to the enemy.
[2:56:11.280 --> 2:56:14.360]  You are losers, and you're going to lose, and you should give up.
[2:56:14.360 --> 2:56:18.360]  But I know you aren't, because the spirit you carry.
[2:56:18.360 --> 2:56:24.720]  But that said, because they're losing, they're going to wind up through all the studies,
[2:56:24.720 --> 2:56:30.480]  hype up mass shootings to more mentally ill people, more wind up toys on anti-depressants
[2:56:30.480 --> 2:56:35.000]  that make you kill people that it says on the insert, who play shoot-em-up games that
[2:56:35.000 --> 2:56:41.120]  are devil worshipers and in devil worship bands and in the pedophilia, always the same.
[2:56:41.120 --> 2:56:44.160]  Always the same.
[2:56:44.160 --> 2:56:46.800]  No background checks, no psychology.
[2:56:46.800 --> 2:56:49.640]  Most of these guys tell people, I'm going to kill everybody, everybody just gets scared
[2:56:49.640 --> 2:56:50.640]  and does nothing.
[2:56:50.640 --> 2:56:55.520]  They do it in Democrat jurisdictions with their stand-downs, over and over again.
[2:56:55.520 --> 2:56:59.080]  So here's the big announcement.
[2:56:59.080 --> 2:57:00.240]  How do we get on the offense?
[2:57:00.240 --> 2:57:03.320]  How do you change one narrative with another narrative that's true?
[2:57:03.320 --> 2:57:07.640]  Because they always change a narrative that's true with a lie.
[2:57:07.640 --> 2:57:12.240]  You have it, whether it's Luvox, or whether it's Prozac, or whether it's the other 50-something
[2:57:12.240 --> 2:57:16.840]  approved, psychotropic, anti-depressants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, every one of
[2:57:16.840 --> 2:57:24.000]  them says, causes megalomania, psychotic breaks, mass murder, causes psychotic killing, sets
[2:57:24.000 --> 2:57:26.760]  it on the insert, and suicide.
[2:57:26.760 --> 2:57:28.760]  And you wonder why these people are all doing this.
[2:57:28.760 --> 2:57:33.280]  You add that, it's in the hallucinogen class, to somebody devil worshiping, it opens up
[2:57:33.280 --> 2:57:34.280]  those gates.
[2:57:34.280 --> 2:57:38.800]  These are demons carrying out these attacks to get our guns to the organized criminal
[2:57:38.800 --> 2:57:43.560]  government and then slaughter us in mass with a satanic red carat.
[2:57:43.560 --> 2:57:47.800]  We sold Secret 12 for four years and it was our number third best seller.
[2:57:47.800 --> 2:57:52.680]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[2:57:52.680 --> 2:57:54.840]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[2:57:54.840 --> 2:57:59.240]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[2:57:59.240 --> 2:58:04.560]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things,
[2:58:04.560 --> 2:58:08.880]  supports healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, helps the body produce energy, helps
[2:58:08.880 --> 2:58:13.880]  produce healthy blood cells, essential for proper nervous system function, it goes on
[2:58:13.880 --> 2:58:14.880]  and on.
[2:58:14.880 --> 2:58:17.560]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation,
[2:58:17.560 --> 2:58:21.480]  weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[2:58:21.480 --> 2:58:23.880]  Bottom line folks, you need Ultra 12.
[2:58:23.880 --> 2:58:28.600]  It helps some of the info war towards the 360 win and it's 50% off for a limited time
[2:58:28.600 --> 2:58:30.080]  at infowarstore.com.

[2:58:36.200 --> 2:58:45.520]  Ultra 12, twice as powerful, half the price, 50% off right now at infowarslive.com.
[2:58:45.520 --> 2:58:51.320]  Super Silver Woon Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S. that has their
[2:58:51.320 --> 2:58:55.760]  products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[2:58:55.760 --> 2:58:58.840]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two
[2:58:58.840 --> 2:58:59.840]  years.
[2:58:59.840 --> 2:59:00.840]  It's been a best seller.
[2:59:00.840 --> 2:59:06.000]  We've been convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the
[2:59:06.000 --> 2:59:10.560]  top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented silver
[2:59:10.560 --> 2:59:12.640]  salt technology in it.
[2:59:12.640 --> 2:59:18.000]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the steric acid, it's got the grapefruit essential
[2:59:18.000 --> 2:59:22.280]  oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[2:59:22.280 --> 2:59:27.840]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one, you're
[2:59:27.840 --> 2:59:31.200]  not going to find a product that's good anywhere, you're certainly not going to find it at this
[2:59:31.200 --> 2:59:35.880]  price and it funds the InfoWare at infowarslive.com.
[2:59:35.880 --> 2:59:40.640]  Get your super silver skin cream today, we can only run this special for another week
[2:59:40.640 --> 2:59:47.240]  or so as I'm taping this September 10th.
[2:59:47.240 --> 3:00:00.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:00.360 --> 3:00:08.240]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:08.240 --> 3:00:18.240]  Alright, let me finish up what I was getting to before we get into the fourth hour here
[3:00:18.240 --> 3:00:21.480]  where I've been admitted to it.
[3:00:21.480 --> 3:00:26.080]  Here's what I'm getting at, they know they're losing politically and culturally so they're
[3:00:26.080 --> 3:00:29.200]  going to wind up in provocateur and even stage events which we know they've been caught
[3:00:29.200 --> 3:00:33.560]  doing before and they're going to blame everybody and say that the nation is run by white supremacists
[3:00:33.560 --> 3:00:38.080]  and criminals to not just try to cause a race war but to start coming at the guns as
[3:00:38.080 --> 3:00:42.320]  they're already doing in seven states with red flag laws outside of law killing veterans
[3:00:42.320 --> 3:00:46.280]  at their houses as they don't even know what's going on to try to trigger people to go out
[3:00:46.280 --> 3:00:49.640]  and start a 1776.
[3:00:49.640 --> 3:00:55.960]  We don't want that, we're winning politically, we do not need to go out and get in confrontations
[3:00:55.960 --> 3:00:56.960]  with people.
[3:00:56.960 --> 3:01:01.760]  If you live in a leftist jurisdiction and you can get out of it, get out of it.
[3:01:01.760 --> 3:01:06.080]  We're here in Austin with the police on average aren't leftist but the system's super bad
[3:01:06.080 --> 3:01:09.960]  if I could pull back from this I would but I've been here, you know, Texas my whole
[3:01:09.960 --> 3:01:10.960]  life.
[3:01:10.960 --> 3:01:13.440]  Texas is just being invaded by the globalist.
[3:01:13.440 --> 3:01:16.880]  I got articles right here about how it's turning blue, it's just the country's in trouble,
[3:01:16.880 --> 3:01:20.400]  we better turn this back now and the enemy knows how close this is while they're pushing
[3:01:20.400 --> 3:01:26.080]  so hard so they want to cause a physical civil war, we don't need that to happen.
[3:01:26.080 --> 3:01:30.560]  If they're able to trigger it then we got to fight for our lives and once it starts
[3:01:30.560 --> 3:01:35.080]  that means offensive but they are going to stage events and say it's us that are targeting
[3:01:35.080 --> 3:01:39.520]  innocents, we know that's them, okay?
[3:01:39.520 --> 3:01:42.960]  And people don't buy anything the news says anymore so we're going to win this.
[3:01:42.960 --> 3:01:49.520]  It's just the globalists are a bunch of wind up toys for their boss, the devil and so they're
[3:01:49.520 --> 3:01:58.760]  not going to stop unless we go on a different counter offensive and they were going to have
[3:01:58.760 --> 3:02:03.760]  me on for the whole hour on Pierce Morgan but when he was accusing gun makers of killing
[3:02:03.760 --> 3:02:13.360]  people I said Pierce, you just had a anti-depressant ad on, it's suicide mass murder pills that
[3:02:13.360 --> 3:02:14.360]  are causing it.
[3:02:14.360 --> 3:02:20.360]  The damn insert says it makes you do that, they have to tell you that so they quote can't
[3:02:20.360 --> 3:02:24.480]  be sued, well they can be sued and the companies know it and the people that subscribe would
[3:02:24.480 --> 3:02:30.480]  know it and almost every one of these guys is on it so we turn it around about the pills
[3:02:30.480 --> 3:02:34.840]  that in 99% of the cases they're on and they're not profiling these people and they're not
[3:02:34.840 --> 3:02:38.960]  stopping them when in every case they're talking about how they're going to kill people.
[3:02:38.960 --> 3:02:45.720]  In the Parkland case he did it 44 times and twice to the FBI 46 times, 20 plus times with
[3:02:45.720 --> 3:02:48.960]  the devil worshipper in Ohio and I could go on for hours.
[3:02:48.960 --> 3:02:52.880]  The guy in Houston outside Houston a few years ago that killed a bunch of people he was a
[3:02:52.880 --> 3:03:05.760]  devil worshipper, he wore pentagrams, swastikas and communists, red flags to scare people
[3:03:05.760 --> 3:03:10.640]  and so we have to get on the offense about how the media hyping it, the study show makes
[3:03:10.640 --> 3:03:16.440]  copycats do it and how they are sick and know what they're doing, that means protesting
[3:03:16.440 --> 3:03:21.760]  them, that means suing them, that means getting aggressive, that means educating others, that
[3:03:21.760 --> 3:03:25.800]  means picketing, that means going to city council whether you're in a republican area
[3:03:25.800 --> 3:03:32.240]  or a democratic area and speaking and it goes out on cable or having your own rally or printing
[3:03:32.240 --> 3:03:36.440]  up pamphlets or starting your own website if you just take a few people out shooting
[3:03:36.440 --> 3:03:41.520]  and teach them how self-defense works a few leftists there's a lot of ways to do this
[3:03:41.520 --> 3:03:45.560]  but it's fundamental they want the right to kill babies and they want the right to take
[3:03:45.560 --> 3:03:50.320]  our guns so that they can take over the state and have their way with us which they admit
[3:03:50.320 --> 3:03:56.400]  they want so that's what it comes down to now I'll cover this more tomorrow in a special
[3:03:56.400 --> 3:04:01.520]  transmission I'm going to start doing Saturdays 2 to 4 p.m. it's going to be called the M4's

[3:05:57.040 --> 3:06:15.520]  So far what we've been able to watch during the orgy promising to confiscate firearms
[3:06:15.520 --> 3:06:19.280]  was this exchange where biden says we're going to confiscate all semi-autos that's 90% of
[3:06:19.280 --> 3:06:23.480]  the firearms are more in this country including most hunting shotguns even though obviously
[3:06:23.480 --> 3:06:26.120]  second of them it's not really about hunting it's about defending yourself from common
[3:06:26.120 --> 3:06:29.560]  criminals and also corrupt out of control governments which killed 200 million people
[3:06:29.560 --> 3:06:32.720]  in the last century after they confiscated the guns that's a lot more than a couple hundred
[3:06:32.720 --> 3:06:35.680]  a year that died in mass shootings which together they hype up like it's the end of the world
[3:06:35.680 --> 3:06:40.280]  it's certainly terrible but microscopic compared to say drowning and automobile accidents or
[3:06:40.280 --> 3:06:45.240]  drug overdoses or flash eating bacteria or drug resistant germs as well so they know
[3:06:45.240 --> 3:06:48.800]  what they're doing and they all the studies are out there that hyping up all these big
[3:06:48.800 --> 3:06:52.880]  mass shootings that do happen only causes mentally ill people to think about that as
[3:06:52.880 --> 3:06:56.440]  something that's an option it's like having a Chinese food restaurant next to a Mexican
[3:06:56.440 --> 3:07:00.320]  food restaurant next to an American food restaurant you know if you didn't have this mass shooting
[3:07:00.320 --> 3:07:04.280]  restaurant people wouldn't walk into it but it's something put out there to weak minds
[3:07:04.280 --> 3:07:08.360]  creating a domino effect or a copycat effect and again major studies all have meant anybody
[3:07:08.360 --> 3:07:12.480]  can pull that up for themselves type in major studies prove that the media is actually triggering
[3:07:12.480 --> 3:07:17.080]  these with these type of lunatics that are out there the mass murder bills in the serotonin
[3:07:17.080 --> 3:07:22.480]  reuptake inhibitor class of course are known as so-called antidepressants to cause megalomania
[3:07:22.480 --> 3:07:27.720]  psychotic breaks mass murder suicide massively off the chart it's on the dam insert so we
[3:07:27.720 --> 3:07:32.280]  should start targeting big pharma with lawsuits and calls for them to be blamed for it because
[3:07:32.280 --> 3:07:37.160]  they actually are in the wheelhouse centrally not guns and then they'll back off real quick
[3:07:37.160 --> 3:07:41.760]  trying to take our guns so there's a lot of ways to stop this situation but I wanted to
[3:07:41.760 --> 3:07:46.280]  play this clip because what's amazing is Harris saying hey it doesn't matter if it's in the
[3:07:46.280 --> 3:07:51.480]  constitution the president can't sign executive order and make law and circumvent the legislative
[3:07:51.480 --> 3:07:58.320]  and of course even the judicial and take power in a true dictatorship which they keep saying
[3:07:58.320 --> 3:08:02.640]  Trump is doing when the supreme court has affirmed every case I've seen including a huge
[3:08:02.640 --> 3:08:10.360]  one just today on his blockage of all Central America on the so-called political refugee
[3:08:10.360 --> 3:08:14.280]  status has been proven to be a fraud that is in the president's constitutional purview
[3:08:14.280 --> 3:08:18.240]  so here is Camilla Harris not just calling for gun confiscation but saying Joe Biden's
[3:08:18.240 --> 3:08:26.560]  weak because he isn't confiscating all of the guns so let's go ahead and go to that
[3:08:26.560 --> 3:08:32.560]  video over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street
[3:08:32.560 --> 3:08:36.840]  period and we have to get buybacks and get them out of their baseness in recent days
[3:08:36.840 --> 3:08:41.440]  former vice president Biden has said about executive order some really talented people
[3:08:41.440 --> 3:08:45.280]  are seeking the nomination they said I'm going to issue an executive order Biden saying there's
[3:08:45.280 --> 3:08:49.320]  no constitutional authority to issue that executive order when they say I'm going to
[3:08:49.320 --> 3:08:53.760]  eliminate assault weapons does the vice president have a point there I mean I would just say
[3:08:53.760 --> 3:09:06.600]  hey Joe it's sad to say no we can't let's say yes we can because I'll tell you something
[3:09:06.600 --> 3:09:12.000]  well do you think Trump is responsible for what happened I said well look I mean obviously
[3:09:12.000 --> 3:09:17.440]  he didn't pull the trigger but he's certainly been tweeting out the ammunition by the way
[3:09:17.440 --> 3:09:22.560]  you can't own the following weapons period they cannot be sold anymore you said quote
[3:09:22.560 --> 3:09:29.000]  Americans who own AR-15s and AK-47s will have to sell them to the government all of them
[3:09:29.000 --> 3:09:33.040]  you know the critics call this confiscation are you proposing taking away their guns
[3:09:33.040 --> 3:09:39.160]  and how would this work I am if it's a weapon that was designed to kill people hell yes
[3:09:39.160 --> 3:09:49.080]  we're going to take your AR-15 your AK-47 everyone up here favors an assault weapon
[3:09:49.080 --> 3:09:56.000]  pan everyone up here favors magazine limitations which by the way would have made a huge difference
[3:09:56.000 --> 3:09:58.920]  that that was in place they know full well you have a couple hundred people killed a
[3:09:58.920 --> 3:10:02.360]  year in mass shootings it's super rare they hype it up that actually causes more people
[3:10:02.360 --> 3:10:06.560]  to do it they're hoping for these are criminals that want to disarm their slaves they're fully
[3:10:06.560 --> 3:10:09.680]  aware of what they're doing they'll talk about the 200,000 dead in Mexico the last ten years
[3:10:09.680 --> 3:10:13.360]  where they have a total ban on guns for citizens but one of the highest crime rates in the world
[3:10:13.360 --> 3:10:17.360]  Chicago ban on guns highest crime rate in the US these dirtbags know what they're doing
[3:10:17.360 --> 3:10:21.200]  they're not idiots they're wanton front men of international criminals that want to enslave
[3:10:21.200 --> 3:10:25.920]  this nation 1776 is why this country started when the redcoats came to take the guns and
[3:10:25.920 --> 3:10:32.160]  if they try to take our firearms 1776 we'll commence again if you try to take our firearms
[3:10:32.160 --> 3:10:35.640]  doesn't matter how many freaking lemons you get out there telling us that we've got to
[3:10:35.640 --> 3:10:39.800]  be your slaves we're not get it through your head no supreme
[3:10:43.160 --> 3:10:47.320]  all right ladies and gentlemen let's go to tom pappert now and we'll go down the line
[3:10:47.320 --> 3:10:53.960]  here and get his take on that amazing exchange we just played right there it was utterly
[3:10:53.960 --> 3:10:59.480]  disturbing the most what was with Kamala Harris there that was the strangest voice that woman
[3:10:59.480 --> 3:11:04.360]  seems to have 15 different personalities all trapped within her fragile mind and that was
[3:11:04.360 --> 3:11:11.320]  just bizarre she sounded like a college frat girl who'd had one too many drinks hey joe let's just
[3:11:11.320 --> 3:11:17.000]  take the guns it's no big deal joe say yes we can take the guns that was utterly bizarre and
[3:11:17.000 --> 3:11:20.920]  again i think it shows that these democrats they think that they find they're either delusional
[3:11:20.920 --> 3:11:25.960]  and they think that they finally got the fire in the american bellies to take our guns and like
[3:11:25.960 --> 3:11:31.480]  alex said 1776 will commence again or else they're just throwing it away they're just throwing it away
[3:11:31.480 --> 3:11:37.960]  at this point is it mere did Kamala Harris sound drunk in that exchange i didn't notice it the first
[3:11:37.960 --> 3:11:47.240]  time but she she sounded drunk she's going on oh just say yes we can it's gonna be all right joe
[3:11:47.240 --> 3:11:51.720]  just say yes we can take the guns i mean hey a little liquid courage i mean i'll you know fine
[3:11:52.760 --> 3:11:58.040]  and by the way he wasn't even saying we can't do it if we pass a law she's saying outside of congress
[3:11:58.040 --> 3:12:02.280]  and you're the constitutional lawyer let's go to barns and then to johnson and and oh and i mean
[3:12:02.280 --> 3:12:07.800]  this is outrageous he's saying you can't do that it's unconstitutional she's saying become a dictator
[3:12:07.800 --> 3:12:13.160]  everything they accuse trump of so kamala harris just said we need a dictator to circumvent congress
[3:12:13.160 --> 3:12:18.280]  and confiscate 90 of the guns yeah what she said specifically was yes we can violate the second
[3:12:18.280 --> 3:12:23.480]  amendment that's what yes we can means yes we can means that if she's elected uh and almost any of
[3:12:23.480 --> 3:12:27.320]  the other democrats who are elected on stage are going to take the position that they can take
[3:12:27.320 --> 3:12:33.960]  executive orders beyond even what president obama was willing to do and to directly infringe second
[3:12:33.960 --> 3:12:39.160]  amendment rights according to vice president joe biden you know this isn't a a liberal or left
[3:12:39.160 --> 3:12:44.680]  leaning position uh the this is this is someone on the left joe biden saying that this would be a
[3:12:44.680 --> 3:12:50.040]  violation of fundamental constitutional second amendment rights and the fact that he can say that
[3:12:50.040 --> 3:12:55.960]  and yet the kamala harris sort of march on in this cause of confiscation to where the most viral
[3:12:55.960 --> 3:13:03.240]  moment tonight and within the democratic primary process on social media is bido bido aurora saying
[3:13:03.240 --> 3:13:08.280]  hey hell yes we're gonna take your guns we're gonna confiscate your guns we're going to take
[3:13:08.280 --> 3:13:13.240]  them away so the democratic party is celebrating tonight that they are going to obliterate and
[3:13:13.240 --> 3:13:18.360]  abolish the second amendment rights of ordinary americans so it's a precarious time to have only
[3:13:18.360 --> 3:13:23.400]  the criminals or the government be in a monopolistic control over guns the whole purpose of the second
[3:13:23.400 --> 3:13:27.640]  amendment was to prohibit that exact reality but kamala harris made clear she will make it a
[3:13:27.640 --> 3:13:31.720]  reality and bob you're absolutely right everyone's focusing on better going hell yeah we're gonna
[3:13:31.720 --> 3:13:37.960]  take all your guns you damn americans he says you americans i mean but the big one for me is she's
[3:13:37.960 --> 3:13:44.760]  going come on we can do it outside of law will just be a dictator i mean whoa these are the people
[3:13:44.760 --> 3:13:49.000]  that under the law the bill of rights the constitution we don't just have a right but a duty to resist
[3:13:49.000 --> 3:13:52.920]  and we don't even want to go to war with them they're coming to war with us why do you think i want to
[3:13:52.920 --> 3:13:58.200]  go to the other guys why do you think they've gone from denying this but behind the scenes doing
[3:13:58.200 --> 3:14:03.640]  every other country every blue city to now admitting we're coming to take your guns we're taking your
[3:14:03.640 --> 3:14:07.800]  kids and we're going to teach them to chop their genitals off i mean these people are just and i've
[3:14:07.800 --> 3:14:12.840]  got a seven minute video we are today of democrats going i love to kill my baby especially little
[3:14:12.840 --> 3:14:16.920]  girls i love to stand over their dead body i've got articles they take photos of the dead bodies and

[3:14:25.240 --> 3:14:31.320]  bastard on netflix and you're just it's not hellraiser it's not a it's not a it's not a fake
[3:14:31.320 --> 3:14:36.520]  movie these people are literally psychotics well if you go back it's sort of very much like the
[3:14:36.520 --> 3:14:41.720]  murky and critique of the french revolution which is that once you abandon standards abandon
[3:14:41.720 --> 3:14:46.680]  traditions abandon religion abandon certain community ideas and ideals that have been here
[3:14:46.680 --> 3:14:50.840]  with our history and precedent forever once you abandon sort of gary will's understanding of
[3:14:50.840 --> 3:14:56.600]  conservatism which he documented his brilliant book nixon agonistics what agonistics once you do
[3:14:56.600 --> 3:15:00.360]  that you have no standards and you end up with guillotine culture and the guillotine culture
[3:15:00.360 --> 3:15:04.680]  that just because the very worst takes over you sink right to the worst and the worst takes charge
[3:15:04.680 --> 3:15:08.840]  the rat because you have to radical what was radical it's become even more radical and you
[3:15:08.840 --> 3:15:12.840]  and you say okay how do we well first we killed off the princes and the popes and the kings okay
[3:15:12.840 --> 3:15:16.200]  well who do we kill off next will we start killing off commoners well that's not really enough
[3:15:16.200 --> 3:15:19.400]  let's start killing off each other i mean that's what the friends were like well that farmer's
[3:15:19.400 --> 3:15:23.320]  got a better crop than me i'll just murder him exactly it's sort of where macgabi went with the
[3:15:23.320 --> 3:15:28.920]  sort of craziness of the his policies and politics when it's about power the worship of power and the
[3:15:28.920 --> 3:15:33.480]  lack of respect for certain tradition and limits on the abuse and misuse of power because christianity
[3:15:33.480 --> 3:15:38.280]  and its real form is about limits on that and not so running over people and instead christianity is
[3:15:38.280 --> 3:15:50.120]  now about letting the evil run over you amazing points

[3:20:13.960 --> 3:20:20.760]  exactly yeah i mean so alex jones has been banned from facebook for a long period of time but now
[3:20:20.760 --> 3:20:25.160]  they banned him they banned his like a little underling paul joseph watson now that they keep
[3:20:25.160 --> 3:20:30.440]  them off the platform that's great for now but it doesn't roll back the clock but you have also
[3:20:30.440 --> 3:20:34.360]  excesses in the first amendment and the second amendment right now you know i don't think that
[3:20:34.360 --> 3:20:39.080]  they for the forefathers said well you can say you know all sorts of hateful things and spread it
[3:20:39.080 --> 3:20:44.200]  around the world literally spread it through the internet i have no issue with it at all i want
[3:20:44.200 --> 3:20:48.600]  them shut down i want them silence i want them muted i think they are horrible for our society
[3:20:49.800 --> 3:20:55.800]  i want them shut down i want them silenced i want them muted but don't worry these people
[3:20:55.800 --> 3:21:06.760]  aren't terrifying or anything so let's talk about the fact that donald trump came into office
[3:21:06.760 --> 3:21:13.000]  and spent almost the entire first year of his term trying to get rid of the affordable care act
[3:21:13.000 --> 3:21:18.520]  we all fought against it and then the late ronnie john mccain at that moment at about two o'clock
[3:21:18.520 --> 3:21:25.720]  in the morning killed his very please attempt to take health care from millions of people in his
[3:21:25.720 --> 3:21:32.680]  country fast forward to today and what is happening donald trump's department of justice donald trump
[3:21:32.680 --> 3:21:39.000]  is trying to get rid of the affordable care the best way for her to jet is to become the biggest
[3:21:39.000 --> 3:21:43.480]  anti-trump candidate in the race oh i mean i'll give her this i mean she's not a she's a good looking
[3:21:43.480 --> 3:21:49.720]  woman but she's such a lying corporate fraud and the name it admits she got her job i mean willie
[3:21:49.720 --> 3:21:53.400]  brown brad you know what i mean which i'm not attacking her for that but she's just she's just
[3:21:53.400 --> 3:21:58.600]  a fraud yeah oh yeah oh you know that about that i've i've said consistently she's the dumbest
[3:21:58.600 --> 3:22:03.880]  lawyer i've ever dealt with in any case oh you've been in cases with oh yes yes on multiple cases
[3:22:03.880 --> 3:22:08.760]  and she's just not bright what she's good at is this she's good at grandstanding in the public
[3:22:08.760 --> 3:22:12.760]  arena that's literally all she's good at well were we able just i know on the fly to find that
[3:22:12.760 --> 3:22:19.080]  important meme that was put out at memeworld.com okay well just you should it's just important
[3:22:19.080 --> 3:22:24.920]  it's come on it's it's it's turn on on wanting to ban meat i mean you know she's come out and
[3:22:24.920 --> 3:22:29.000]  and i mean being serious yes millie talked to some of the democrats about how they want to ban
[3:22:29.000 --> 3:22:34.120]  meat and then uh de Blasio he made a joke about it but now they're openly saying that millie oh yeah
[3:22:34.120 --> 3:22:39.400]  they want to ban meat they're radical most of these politicians are radical that are running
[3:22:39.400 --> 3:22:45.080]  and only amy klobuchar and joe biden are some of the ones that are somewhat more moderate
[3:22:45.080 --> 3:22:49.720]  but the progressives are rejecting them the woke millennials they don't want them and another
[3:22:49.720 --> 3:22:54.520]  hold on i'm even up biden's talking let's go back sorry insurance they're gonna give back that money
[3:22:54.520 --> 3:22:59.400]  to the employee matter of fact they will let me tell you something for a socialist you gotta
[3:22:59.400 --> 3:23:02.600]  you for a socialist you got a lot more confidence in corporate america than i do
[3:23:02.600 --> 3:23:08.520]  oh yeah you're good with the line corporate america socialists will screw you over so fast
[3:23:08.520 --> 3:23:12.680]  for the big globalist want socialism because then it's a centralized system to suck the money
[3:23:12.680 --> 3:23:18.520]  offshore we have 87 million people uninsured and underinsured it's a dog's eye you gotta defend
[3:23:18.520 --> 3:23:24.360]  the fact that 500 000 amazons are going bad they're not good enough exactly you know why they're
[3:23:24.360 --> 3:23:31.000]  going bankrupt because they suffered a terrible disease cancer or heart disease under my legend
[3:23:31.000 --> 3:23:39.960]  you study america's pay for it into phil's with a diagnosis of cancer and our program
[3:23:39.960 --> 3:23:44.120]  it's gonna piss people off and have cancer but they're putting the damn viruses in the vaccines
[3:23:45.320 --> 3:23:50.920]  it's personal to me let me tell you something every single person who's diagnosed with cancer
[3:23:50.920 --> 3:23:57.160]  any other disease supposed to get the most time become part of this plan they will not go bankrupt
[3:23:57.160 --> 3:24:02.280]  because of that they will not go bankrupt because that they can join immediately and we're talking
[3:24:02.280 --> 3:24:08.040]  four six eight ten years depending on you talk about before we get to medicare for all come on
[3:24:08.600 --> 3:24:13.720]  i've been there you've been there you know what it's like people need help now hope now and do
[3:24:13.720 --> 3:24:23.720]  something now congressman or lord yeah i bet you thank you listen um i'm grateful that we all agree
[3:24:23.720 --> 3:24:28.760]  no one is about the urgency of this challenge and the fact that donald trump is undermining
[3:24:28.760 --> 3:24:34.120]  the limited protections that we have right now but i also think we're being offered a false choice
[3:24:34.120 --> 3:24:39.560]  between those who propose an all or nothing gambit forcing tens of millions off of insurance
[3:24:39.560 --> 3:24:43.960]  that they like that works for them to force them on a medicare and others who want to as a vice
[3:24:43.960 --> 3:24:49.320]  president does incrementally improve what we have which will still leave many maybe millions
[3:24:49.320 --> 3:24:55.240]  uninsured and uncared for in a state where the largest provider of mental health care services
[3:24:55.240 --> 3:25:01.000]  is the county jail system we've got to do better in my proposal medicare for america says everyone
[3:25:01.000 --> 3:25:05.960]  who's uninsured will be enrolled in medicare everyone who's insufficiently insured cannot afford
[3:25:05.960 --> 3:25:10.440]  it can move over to medicare and those like members of unions who fought for the health
[3:25:10.440 --> 3:25:15.400]  care plans that work you wrote books about running over children that is the best possible path for
[3:25:15.400 --> 3:25:20.040]  this is the health care is the top issue for everyone in the country everyone gets one minute
[3:25:20.040 --> 3:25:24.440]  to respond so current senator secretary castro andrew yang and then senator senator booker you
[3:25:24.440 --> 3:25:29.640]  will get a thank you and you know i also want to recognize uh the work that bernie has done on this
[3:25:29.640 --> 3:25:35.480]  uh and of course uh we owe a debt of gratitude to president brock obama okay of course i also like
[3:25:35.480 --> 3:25:40.120]  kim jung uh vice president biden and i know that the problem with your plan is that it leaves 10
[3:25:40.120 --> 3:25:45.240]  million people uncovered now on the last stage in detroit you said that wasn't true when senator
[3:25:45.240 --> 3:25:50.760]  Harris brought that up there was a fact check of that and they said women there are men uh access
[3:25:50.760 --> 3:25:56.200]  to abortion yeah so men that don't have a uterus yep millie would you like to comment on that i'm
[3:25:56.200 --> 3:26:03.240]  sorry tell us what you think about that well i think that if we decide to adopt this medical for
[3:26:03.240 --> 3:26:10.440]  all policies that the democrats want our nation will forever be enslaved by the burden of paying
[3:26:10.440 --> 3:26:17.560]  for all these sick people's health care bills i mean america's america's a sick nation people get
[3:26:17.560 --> 3:26:23.080]  vaccinated they take all the big pharma pills they eat all the garbage eugenics food and then
[3:26:23.080 --> 3:26:28.920]  their bodies are sick and then they require all this medical care and it's a vicious cycle i mean
[3:26:28.920 --> 3:26:35.640]  our society is rolling out of control it's like a snowball effect uh i can't see that i can't see
[3:26:35.640 --> 3:26:42.280]  how we won't become a socialist country just if we adopt the medical position that these guys are
[3:26:42.280 --> 3:26:46.520]  wanting to take angry but yeah let's go you're absolutely right that was the most smartest thing
[3:26:46.520 --> 3:26:51.320]  i've heard today on the show we've been going live since eight a.m is that big pharma is pushing all
[3:26:51.320 --> 3:26:56.360]  these toxic chemicals all these things on to us and then they know full well it's making a sicker
[3:26:56.360 --> 3:27:00.440]  and then it bankrupts the system more they get a bigger and bigger piece of the gdp and they're
[3:27:00.440 --> 3:27:05.000]  just phasing us into this medical tyranny now where the medical tyrant whole side who can have guns
[3:27:05.000 --> 3:27:09.960]  and who can't outside of the process and as you were just saying uh biden's getting madder and
[3:27:09.960 --> 3:27:14.920]  madder as you predicted tonight yeah he is he keeps them he's he's he can't control his uh anger
[3:27:14.920 --> 3:27:18.520]  which normally he does i mean you're seeing yeah let's go back to biden here we go fulfilling the
[3:27:18.520 --> 3:27:23.880]  legacy of barack obama and you're not i'll be surprised to him andry yang
[3:27:26.840 --> 3:27:32.120]  this is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable yeah this reminds everybody of what
[3:27:32.120 --> 3:27:37.720]  they cannot stand about washington's scoring points against each other poking at each other
[3:27:37.720 --> 3:27:42.600]  and telling each other that that you're my plan you're well look we all that's called the democratic
[3:27:42.600 --> 3:27:47.160]  primary election better about it that's called an election that's an election no it's like the
[3:27:49.160 --> 3:27:54.520]  he's smart attested that he would try to make his face he had to break through tonight in some
[3:27:54.520 --> 3:28:06.520]  love and that is and i believe we're talking about this the wrong way as someone who has run
[3:28:06.520 --> 3:28:12.360]  a business i know you get a thousand dollars exactly makes like we don't need free healthcare
[3:28:12.360 --> 3:28:15.640]  we just need free money let's do everybody for your money that's all i'm talking about free

[3:28:19.240 --> 3:28:24.360]  the pitch we have to make the american people as we make it simpler at least wait off of your backs and
[3:28:24.360 --> 3:28:29.480]  then unleash the leader of zimbabwe tried that robert macgabi yes yes then it was like what 25
[3:28:29.480 --> 3:28:35.560]  billion uh of their of their currency was what was equivalent of one yeah and so after that it was
[3:28:35.560 --> 3:28:39.960]  like well let's kill the white people and take all their property and that's basically what he did

[3:35:04.680 --> 3:35:11.560]  of this a and then b the big news us attorney recommends prosecuting and proceeding with
[3:35:11.560 --> 3:35:16.680]  charges against mccabe which means it's going to happen we'll break that down a moment this is huge
[3:35:17.800 --> 3:35:24.680]  oh yeah this is huge news it's a it's a great revelation as far as draining the swamp this is
[3:35:24.680 --> 3:35:29.480]  great news as far as mccabe goes now i want to talk a little bit about the debates right now
[3:35:30.040 --> 3:35:36.760]  we know that there's kind of a a three-way battle going on between warren biden and sanders
[3:35:36.760 --> 3:35:42.920]  uh biden right now they say has the leads in the polls but the polls aren't very trusting anyway
[3:35:43.480 --> 3:35:48.280]  we know that warren has actually done very well this summer she's actually been the only
[3:35:48.280 --> 3:35:54.760]  democratic candidate that has been continually uh accelerating as far as her polling numbers
[3:35:55.400 --> 3:36:02.520]  and her money raising as well and i when i was at the last democrat debate i talked to a democrat
[3:36:02.520 --> 3:36:08.760]  insider off record and they were basically say look at the money they said look at the money
[3:36:08.760 --> 3:36:14.040]  that is how you can tell who's actually really running and then who's just running so that
[3:36:14.040 --> 3:36:19.800]  they can promote themselves for another year uh in office as a senator who's just doing it for
[3:36:19.800 --> 3:36:23.960]  publicity and who's serious i've i've i've seen reports that the trump administration is worried
[3:36:23.960 --> 3:36:27.960]  about warren uh do you think that's actually the case and then and then we'll get barns's take
[3:36:27.960 --> 3:36:35.160]  i do i think that warren actually she's she doesn't get as much of the flak that bernie sanders gets
[3:36:35.160 --> 3:36:40.920]  for her socialist communist policies but many democrat socialists actually say that she's just
[3:36:40.920 --> 3:36:46.200]  bernie sanders with a plan so her policies are very similar you can see today she speaks
[3:36:46.200 --> 3:36:53.080]  radically she talks about medicare for everyone uh free college free this free that i mean she
[3:36:53.080 --> 3:36:58.440]  really wants to hand out those those democrat bucks to everyone it almost seems like this is a
[3:36:58.440 --> 3:37:04.360]  a competition to see who can promise everyone the most free stuff uh it's ridiculous even
[3:37:04.360 --> 3:37:12.360]  beto earlier abc was running a special where beto sat down with voters at his home in el Paso and
[3:37:12.360 --> 3:37:19.480]  they did a special where they asked him questions and one of the his own democrat voters asked him
[3:37:19.480 --> 3:37:25.960]  him how are you going to pay for free college that you're proposing and he said oh well there
[3:37:25.960 --> 3:37:33.640]  will be a the return will be the wages from these college students so this is socialism
[3:37:33.640 --> 3:37:36.920]  that they want he's saying they're making more money because of their degree which are getting
[3:37:36.920 --> 3:37:42.680]  more and more worthless because now colleges are just handing them out uh robber barns so i mean i
[3:37:42.680 --> 3:37:49.560]  don't think uh i think trump wants the democratic party to believe he's afraid of elizabeth warn uh
[3:37:49.560 --> 3:37:53.240]  but in fact he sort of just he sort of gave away the game on this a couple of weeks ago and when
[3:37:53.240 --> 3:37:57.320]  he was speaking at one of his events and he pointed out that he probably shouldn't he should have
[3:37:57.320 --> 3:38:01.800]  waited to give a warrant her pocahontas nickname until she actually got the nomination because he
[3:38:01.800 --> 3:38:07.800]  was so excited to seeing her be all of the surveys and polls show that warren is the second weakest
[3:38:07.800 --> 3:38:11.960]  candidate against him absolutely i'm gonna go back to that moment i'm just noticing something here
[3:38:11.960 --> 3:38:16.680]  let's go back to sanders they just cut away they're giving sanders most of the time supposed to be
[3:38:16.680 --> 3:38:21.960]  warren and biden sanders is really dominating they just cut away but i've been watching he's
[3:38:21.960 --> 3:38:26.360]  gotten the most time so far biden seems to be sitting there kind of wood carving well our
[3:38:26.360 --> 3:38:32.440]  prediction was that uh the two people to bet on one was julian castrow and the other one was to
[3:38:32.440 --> 3:38:36.440]  bet on bernie bernie was you said that today on my show exactly well that was a way why is he taking
[3:38:36.440 --> 3:38:40.040]  over they're all they're all addressing him like he's the real leader because it's happening right
[3:38:40.040 --> 3:38:44.040]  now because it's it's his health care bill and he wants to talk about it the most and shut out
[3:38:44.040 --> 3:38:49.240]  warren and show himself as the true believer of the cause and so it's smarter bernie bernie knows he
[3:38:49.240 --> 3:38:55.720]  needs to continue to project through these debates dominance on policy to replace warren amongst
[3:38:55.720 --> 3:39:00.360]  his particularly his college students now it's time to develop something kind of like what
[3:39:00.360 --> 3:39:05.960]  judicial watch is done with foyer request but but even stronger and then also that advocates
[3:39:05.960 --> 3:39:12.440]  for people's speech and you've won hundreds and hundreds of major cases and you've got your
[3:39:12.440 --> 3:39:15.720]  covington suits yours haven't been thrown out like the others you predicted those others
[3:39:16.280 --> 3:39:21.080]  would be thrown out and we're you know obviously that captured counsel type thing that you were
[3:39:21.080 --> 3:39:25.720]  talking about us what a lot of that had the smell of but regardless we're blazing a path with really
[3:39:25.720 --> 3:39:29.800]  good lawsuits that are going to help the state attorney generals and help the president who
[3:39:29.800 --> 3:39:34.520]  we know our information is getting to and we're leading by example and you said months ago let's
[3:39:34.520 --> 3:39:38.440]  wait till the state's act in coordination with the president we now know he's coordinating that
[3:39:38.440 --> 3:39:43.080]  so this is the move so speak to the president's coordination and how he's finally taking action
[3:39:43.080 --> 3:39:48.600]  and how this ties into the first fbi director ever that they've announced he will be indicted
[3:39:48.600 --> 3:39:54.520]  those i mean that is happening we need to break that down as well uh for a few minutes here and
[3:39:54.520 --> 3:39:59.720]  but then also talk about that vacuum that the aclu is not not actually uh you know you're filling
[3:39:59.720 --> 3:40:04.600]  anymore exactly i mean what's happened is you we need a counterpart to the southern poverty law center
[3:40:04.600 --> 3:40:10.120]  we need the aclu for everybody for people on the political right not just people with uh
[3:40:10.120 --> 3:40:15.240]  political beliefs on the left the aclu has abandoned free speech in most context in fact
[3:40:15.240 --> 3:40:20.120]  they're constantly calling for censorship now in a wide range of areas so there's no legal
[3:40:20.120 --> 3:40:25.000]  organization out there to support people that are part of the their independence are on the right
[3:40:25.000 --> 3:40:29.160]  politically they're standing up for issues related to life related to speech related to
[3:40:29.160 --> 3:40:33.880]  opposing war those are the ones those are the voices they're seeking to suppress and to censor
[3:40:33.880 --> 3:40:38.120]  and that's why there needs to be legal remedies and legal the legal rights protected of those
[3:40:38.120 --> 3:40:42.760]  americans and so the point of free american law center is to substitute in for that now the left
[3:40:42.760 --> 3:40:48.760]  has had a long-standing institutional advantage in the legal arena because one a lot of liberals
[3:40:48.760 --> 3:40:53.320]  a lot of lawyers lean left that's part of the bias a lot of the judiciary leans left on a range
[3:40:53.320 --> 3:40:57.880]  of issues the sort of establishment liberals on a range of issues that allows the left to have an
[3:40:57.880 --> 3:41:03.080]  advantage institutionally but one critical component is the left often gives and contributes to
[3:41:03.080 --> 3:41:08.040]  legal organizations simply to feel good for themselves so and feel good about themselves
[3:41:08.040 --> 3:41:12.120]  people on the right generally have not they generally want something in return that makes them
[3:41:12.120 --> 3:41:17.320]  the people on the right uniquely good business people but it is it is disabled and handicapped

[3:46:00.040 --> 3:46:06.120]  ago it makes me sick to my stomach to be vindicated and have the fire department of new york and
[3:46:07.080 --> 3:46:13.880]  major construction and engineering firms come out and confirm that bombs were in tower one tower
[3:46:13.880 --> 3:46:20.840]  two and of course building seven it just pancakes and the then fbi director robert muller helped
[3:46:20.840 --> 3:46:26.680]  cover the whole thing up with the soddies in the know that there's a deep state group working
[3:46:27.320 --> 3:46:32.920]  within our government with radical islam who are using the threat of islamic terror to take our
[3:46:32.920 --> 3:46:38.040]  basic liberties and freedoms while empowering and funding radical islam to take over the planet
[3:46:38.040 --> 3:46:43.560]  well 18 years later i'm here to tell you that the world is awakened in 9 11 and info wars and our
[3:46:43.560 --> 3:46:48.200]  researchers and our guests our whistleblowers have been vindicated yet again that's why info
[3:46:48.200 --> 3:47:01.800]  wars.com is more important than ever you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:01.800 --> 3:47:13.960]  and it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say i don't know what's going to happen at
[3:47:13.960 --> 3:47:22.200]  the end of this but you want to fight you better believe you got one from the front lines of the
[3:47:22.200 --> 3:47:38.440]  information war it's alex jones
[3:47:52.920 --> 3:47:57.720]  as more of these democrat cities are getting more violent and when they can't sign
[3:47:57.720 --> 3:48:02.200]  gun control legislation to take away your second amendment right the more and more violence like
[3:48:02.200 --> 3:48:09.400]  for example here in austin there was a place i like to go get lunch around here and the owner
[3:48:09.400 --> 3:48:15.640]  of the restaurant noticed my what i was carrying on my hip and he came up and he asked me about it
[3:48:15.640 --> 3:48:19.480]  he said he was like hey you know what is that you know did you where'd you get in all the stuff
[3:48:19.480 --> 3:48:24.920]  because the business up the street from him got robbed they broke in and robbed the place
[3:48:24.920 --> 3:48:29.080]  and so the and this is in austin where the democrats are taking over and it's just getting
[3:48:29.080 --> 3:48:33.880]  worse and worse with the more more liberal policies that they enact but the more and more
[3:48:33.880 --> 3:48:38.440]  people are experiencing either direct threats to their own personal security their family security
[3:48:38.440 --> 3:48:44.520]  their businesses theft robberies all of this stuff the violence the more people are going to get
[3:48:44.520 --> 3:48:51.160]  guns we just saw a 15 surge in gun sales so the more and more the left is promoting this
[3:48:51.160 --> 3:48:56.200]  anti-gun agenda yet the more and more their cities that they were under getting more violent
[3:48:56.200 --> 3:49:00.840]  the more and more people are getting guns the equation does not add up for the democrats
[3:49:00.840 --> 3:49:03.720]  yeah you're gonna have people that want to turn their guns in and be slaves i guess you'll have
[3:49:03.720 --> 3:49:11.560]  that in every population but the popular opinion is the second amendment's in and and hey uh hey
[3:49:11.560 --> 3:49:14.920]  guess what if you want to get rid of your guns you don't need the government to help you do that
[3:49:14.920 --> 3:49:19.400]  you can just get rid of your guns if you feel guilty and give them to me you mean yeah give them
[3:49:19.400 --> 3:49:25.880]  to me i don't need a volunteer take back if you hey if you're out there and you want to get
[3:49:25.880 --> 3:49:30.920]  rid of your gun you can send them to me i'll be happy oh i'm stealing this i'm stealing this right
[3:49:30.920 --> 3:49:36.600]  now i'm putting it on twitter first oh if you want to get rid of them let me see if i can beat
[3:49:36.600 --> 3:49:42.120]  you too oh i'll be happy to take your gun if you really want to get rid of them you have to ar-15
[3:49:42.120 --> 3:49:49.400]  got the ak-5 uh ak-47 whatever it is your burrata your nine millimeter your 38 whatever it is you
[3:49:49.400 --> 3:49:55.400]  want to get rid of it by all means send it to me i'll be happy to take it off your liberal hands
[3:49:55.400 --> 3:49:59.400]  you know well i think i'm less picky than you because i'll take a high point whatever people
[3:49:59.400 --> 3:50:04.600]  want to get rid of you know where to send it any three of us will happily happily disarm you
[3:50:04.600 --> 3:50:10.040]  yeah yeah absolutely you know what happily disarm you i like that let me let me say this let me
[3:50:10.040 --> 3:50:15.640]  say this you know what the democrats i think i this is my true this is why i truly believe
[3:50:15.640 --> 3:50:23.000]  that they're going after gun control one because after the civil war it was gun control that they
[3:50:23.000 --> 3:50:28.280]  wanted to implement so black people could not be able to protect themselves from the democratic kkk
[3:50:28.280 --> 3:50:33.880]  because after the civil war the nra teamed up with the republicans to arm black people to protect
[3:50:33.880 --> 3:50:38.920]  themselves from these people that wanted to harm them and kill them so then the democrats got upset
[3:50:38.920 --> 3:50:45.800]  so i think it's a personal vendetta against the nra all of these years against with the with the
[3:50:45.800 --> 3:50:54.200]  democrats so if they if they can finally get the nra under their boots they will do so but this
[3:50:54.200 --> 3:50:59.080]  has been a personal vendetta all these years and they're not letting it go because they help black
[3:50:59.080 --> 3:51:04.200]  people and because they help black people that is the main problem here well yeah and actually the
[3:51:04.200 --> 3:51:08.760]  second biggest gun group is that i forget it's the national african-american association of
[3:51:08.760 --> 3:51:14.200]  rifle owners or something i forget what it is yeah i saw a uh somebody was tweeting out like well
[3:51:14.200 --> 3:51:18.200]  you know us us black and brown people will go out and buy guns and then we'll see how fast the law
[3:51:18.200 --> 3:51:23.320]  changed and it's like wow you you really should understand joke yeah that dave chappelle which
[3:51:23.320 --> 3:51:27.240]  is absolutely disgusting he says what are we gonna have to do to get white people to get rid of their
[3:51:27.240 --> 3:51:31.240]  guns so i know let's get all the black people to get guns and then whites will take guns from
[3:51:31.240 --> 3:51:36.680]  likes like no you absolutely moron the democrats want your guns so you can continue to be a victim
[3:51:36.680 --> 3:51:41.000]  that's the whole point in this go ahead get a gun defend yourself from whitey whatever you whatever
[3:51:41.000 --> 3:51:45.800]  excuse you want to have go get a gun yeah exactly that that's the big misunderstanding is they're
[3:51:45.800 --> 3:51:51.960]  like oh we'll go get guns now and we're like okay good great no oh my gosh we we've actually this
[3:51:51.960 --> 3:51:59.800]  is it we've just defeated we can now use the left ideology against them i'm so scared of white people
[3:51:59.800 --> 3:52:07.480]  i need a gun that's good like no no no seriously like guys i i've seen it on cnn i've seen it white
[3:52:07.480 --> 3:52:12.280]  terrorists are everywhere and they're just trying to murder everybody white people are out of control
[3:52:12.280 --> 3:52:15.640]  i need a gun to protect myself from the white people they're out of control in this country
[3:52:15.640 --> 3:52:20.600]  and if the democrats dare take my gun when white people are running around killing people left and
[3:52:20.600 --> 3:52:25.800]  right in the streets every day i heard it on cnn well then i'll be damned i need to protect myself
[3:52:25.800 --> 3:52:30.520]  from whitey i saw it on cnn this is unbelievable that's exactly right you look at that democratic
[3:52:30.520 --> 3:52:36.520]  stage you see all those white people trying to push gun control to to disarm those black people so
[3:52:36.520 --> 3:52:40.440]  so white people can victimize them that's that is exactly right very good stuff
[3:52:40.440 --> 3:52:50.840]  comparing this president to the president we have is outrageous number one we didn't lock
[3:52:50.840 --> 3:52:56.280]  people up in cages we didn't separate families we didn't do all of those things joe biden they're
[3:52:56.280 --> 3:53:02.680]  defending president obama's immigration policies while launching accusations at the trump team yet
[3:53:02.680 --> 3:53:07.800]  again let's bring in customs and border patrol border protection deputy commissioner robert
[3:53:07.800 --> 3:53:12.680]  peres thank you very much for talking to us uh biden's claims there that obama didn't lock people
[3:53:12.680 --> 3:53:17.480]  up in cages is simply untrue and this false narrative is no different than what other
[3:53:17.480 --> 3:53:22.040]  democrats have been incorrectly saying for months now and i'm not going to ask you to analyze last
[3:53:22.040 --> 3:53:27.960]  night's debate but the cages were built by the obama administration in 2014 not trump correct
[3:53:29.400 --> 3:53:35.240]  well thanks for having me julie um and that is correct look what i can tell you by virtue of
[3:53:35.240 --> 3:53:40.600]  nearly 27 years of experience and being a career law enforcement professional is this is that the
[3:53:40.600 --> 3:53:45.880]  challenges and the loopholes to the legal framework that have been fueling first the border security
[3:53:45.880 --> 3:53:52.760]  crisis that evolved into a humanitarian crisis have been present through several administrations
[3:53:52.760 --> 3:53:59.240]  not just the last two in some cases even beyond that and so over the last year as you know we've
[3:53:59.240 --> 3:54:05.000]  taken some unprecedented steps to deal the best we can within the confines of this legal framework
[3:54:05.000 --> 3:54:09.640]  over the last few months is particularly with working with our colleagues in mexico uh and
[3:54:09.640 --> 3:54:16.120]  others and we've made some real inroads into what is and continues to be a broken legal framework
[3:54:16.120 --> 3:54:22.520]  look julie congress just got back in town it is time for them to get to work with us to find
[3:54:22.520 --> 3:54:28.120]  lasting solutions to this ongoing challenge make no mistake about it however we're going to continue
[3:54:28.120 --> 3:54:32.520]  to do all we can we're going to continue to build as much border wall to deal with that border
[3:54:32.520 --> 3:54:38.120]  security crisis to be able to deal with the criminals the drug smugglers the gangsters and
[3:54:38.120 --> 3:54:42.840]  the like who try to evade capture and we're going to continue to deal with the humanitarian crisis
[3:54:42.840 --> 3:54:48.600]  to disincentivize people from being exploited by criminals not unlike the asylum rule that the
[3:54:48.600 --> 3:54:53.160]  supreme court ruled on earlier this week so what is being used now to lock up detainees we were
[3:54:53.160 --> 3:54:58.840]  just showing video a moment ago uh in fact the associated press photo that had circulated by
[3:54:58.840 --> 3:55:05.240]  anti trump critics that basically we're using trump's zero you know tolerance policy um in talking
[3:55:05.240 --> 3:55:11.400]  about family separations by showing video photos taken in 2014 at a customs and border protection
[3:55:11.400 --> 3:55:16.680]  facility in arizona um showing that the cages were actually during the obama years cages are not
[3:55:16.680 --> 3:55:24.200]  being used now let's be clear let's talk about what is being used so julie look uh you know our
[3:55:24.200 --> 3:55:30.520]  colleagues in immigration customs enforcement they are the primary agency charged with longer
[3:55:30.520 --> 3:55:35.880]  term detention uh we had customs and border protection and uh specifically and particularly
[3:55:35.880 --> 3:55:41.800]  the border patrol both at our ports of entry and in those stations are really short term holding
[3:55:41.800 --> 3:55:46.520]  facilities we've been saying that for months uh as everybody knows over the course of the summer
[3:55:46.520 --> 3:55:51.800]  they became absolutely oversaturated these are facilities that were never meant to hold people
[3:55:51.800 --> 3:55:57.320]  long term nonetheless well we've taken our unprecedented steps to build soft sided facilities
[3:55:57.320 --> 3:56:03.720]  to increase that capacity and when and while we were having to hold people longer in our custody
[3:56:03.720 --> 3:56:09.320]  take the best of care that we possibly could to them procreate more room for them and in for example
[3:56:09.320 --> 3:56:15.560]  also uh ingest and or deploy an unprecedented level of medical support for example today
[3:56:15.560 --> 3:56:21.240]  over 200 physician assistants nurse practitioners all along the southern border to make sure that
[3:56:21.240 --> 3:56:26.600]  these very vulnerable populations who continue to be exploited by criminal elements are being
[3:56:26.600 --> 3:56:31.880]  cared for while they're in our custody all right we just got august numbers of us border patrol
[3:56:31.880 --> 3:56:40.360]  southwest border apprehensions and those numbers are down take a look august 50 693 down 20 000
[3:56:40.360 --> 3:56:49.960]  from july uh at 71 and then another 20 000 away in june at 94 and back in may 132 000 these numbers
[3:56:49.960 --> 3:56:57.560]  have come down could you explain to us why absolutely julie uh so what we've realized is the uh
[3:56:57.560 --> 3:57:02.680]  unprecedented again agreement with mexico uh that needs to be mentioned first where
[3:57:02.680 --> 3:57:08.040]  they have deployed over 25 000 of their national guard at their southern border with Guatemala
[3:57:08.040 --> 3:57:13.720]  throughout their interior and along our shared border with them we continue to share information
[3:57:13.720 --> 3:57:19.000]  intelligence on the threats and how the alien smuggling organizations are functioning to
[3:57:19.000 --> 3:57:23.160]  stop that flow from ever reaching and we're collaborating with them with programs like the
[3:57:23.160 --> 3:57:28.440]  migrant protection protocol which we're expanding with some dedicated facilities for those programs
[3:57:28.440 --> 3:57:33.880]  that is part of the real difference that has made uh that we've realized in the last few months but
[3:57:33.880 --> 3:57:38.680]  we're still in a crisis julie it's still both border security and humanitarian by virtue of what
[3:57:38.680 --> 3:57:51.160]  we're seeing uh even last month
