[00:00.000 --> 00:10.040]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones one thing we're not
[00:10.040 --> 00:36.680]  playing games and I remember you know it was very rough three four months ago
[00:36.680 --> 00:47.040]  that's very nice thank you that's very no bell I just want to get the job done
[00:47.040 --> 01:03.240]  so if we would have last night I pointed out that President Trump should be
[01:03.240 --> 01:09.440]  nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize and what is the nomination process well you
[01:09.440 --> 01:14.480]  have the Nobel Committee and members of that can recommend someone for it it's
[01:14.480 --> 01:18.320]  one of the most prestigious prizes out there but it's become very very not just
[01:18.320 --> 01:24.160]  worthless but really I think a negative price when they gave Al Gore a prize and
[01:24.160 --> 01:28.280]  they gave Barack Obama a prize when he was just president-elect and then
[01:28.280 --> 01:33.000]  launched record numbers of wars if they would have revoked those prizes then I
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.960]  would say it had some value back when they were giving it to Alexander
[01:35.960 --> 01:40.960]  Schultz and Ethan and people like Martin Luther King Jr. Dr. Martin Luther King
[01:40.960 --> 01:51.480]  but now it is a badge of infamy and corruption and the Nobel Prize for Mr.
[01:51.480 --> 01:58.440]  Nobel of Sweden inventor of dynamite has now become a cruel joke maybe it was
[01:58.440 --> 02:05.640]  always a cruel joke but now hours after I pointed out I think everybody else
[02:05.640 --> 02:11.400]  could see the prime official evidence of it the South Korean president calls for
[02:11.400 --> 02:15.560]  Trump to get the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on North Korea North and South
[02:15.560 --> 02:20.680]  of agreed to end the war officially in the next few weeks and to do nuclear eyes
[02:20.680 --> 02:26.120]  and to begin a 10-year process that means within 10 years they will begin the
[02:26.120 --> 02:31.960]  process of officially merging but head of that economic military diplomatic
[02:31.960 --> 02:38.920]  cultural exchange Wow talk about getting the Communist boot off of the neck of
[02:38.920 --> 02:43.640]  North Korea this is a great start and it's all because the strategy of global
[02:43.640 --> 02:48.240]  tension the strategy of using North Korea as a detonator is ending because
[02:48.240 --> 02:52.000]  Trump is saying no now the globalists are trying to sabotage it they're trying
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.080]  to poo poo it remember they said Trump is gonna kill us all for his policies actually
[02:56.080 --> 03:00.360]  bringing pressure on the North the North have been coddled and propped up and
[03:00.360 --> 03:05.360]  given the fissile material the reactors and of course the delivery systems from
[03:05.360 --> 03:13.160]  the boost start boost to final boost to reentry to multiple warhead delivery
[03:13.160 --> 03:19.160]  systems everything had been given to them by the Clinton East is for global
[03:19.160 --> 03:23.960]  destabilization and the continued sellout of this nation well just like a
[03:23.960 --> 03:28.960]  record skipping or two cars crashing they've been sitting down on a patio
[03:28.960 --> 03:35.440]  having lunch you hear a car wreck even a half mile away and you're you go wow
[03:35.440 --> 03:40.440]  that sounds bad well that's the record skipping of the car crashing as the
[03:40.440 --> 03:45.800]  globalist policy goes down in flames and clapper and Brennan and Obama and
[03:45.800 --> 03:50.920]  Hillary and all the globalist how about how stupid Trump is and Paul Krugman
[03:50.920 --> 03:56.240]  you'll never bring the economy back you'll never hit 3% growth rate and they
[03:56.240 --> 04:02.360]  were there bad-mouthing at all because they've been oppressing it they've been
[04:02.360 --> 04:06.920]  driving it down they've been strangling the country to consolidate power with
[04:06.920 --> 04:13.520]  other team leaders like Jeff Bezos and all the other usual followers but you're
[04:13.520 --> 04:18.800]  gonna watch more and more the British Royal the Rockefeller Rothschild plan
[04:18.800 --> 04:22.520]  you'll learn to watch the wheels come off of it because it's authoritarian and
[04:22.520 --> 04:26.280]  because you and I and many others have been exposing it as an unelected
[04:26.280 --> 04:31.320]  corporate private world government above-the-law tax exempt diplomatic
[04:31.320 --> 04:37.240]  immunity that wants us to be poor as a system of neo-futilism served them and
[04:37.240 --> 04:43.480]  guess what it sucks it's unpopular it's draconian and it only takes us to
[04:43.480 --> 04:50.040]  the depopulation eugenics hand so we want the Buck Rogers future we want the
[04:50.040 --> 04:53.920]  Buck Rogers 21st century version we don't want your eugenics creeper

[05:20.160 --> 05:25.960]  quite frankly I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their
[05:25.960 --> 05:29.640]  patients but it wasn't prescription but they were charging people a hundred two
[05:29.640 --> 05:34.800]  hundred dollars for the formulae and I came up with our own formula working with

[06:26.480 --> 06:32.360]  ladies and gentlemen we are live we are broadcasting worldwide on this Monday the
[06:32.360 --> 06:39.400]  30th day hard to believe of April 2018 and the president of South Korea has
[06:39.400 --> 06:46.720]  publicly nominated president Donald J. Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize for his
[06:46.720 --> 06:55.960]  work seminal critical central work bringing peace to the peninsula as Scott
[06:55.960 --> 06:59.480]  Adams said on the show Friday there's wanting to do something and there's
[06:59.480 --> 07:05.480]  deciding to do it and Kim Jong-un has decided to go with a reunification plan
[07:05.480 --> 07:09.640]  to give up the nuclear weapons and to basically phase out the North Korean
[07:09.640 --> 07:16.520]  dictatorship and to begin a 10-year unification plan now again this is a
[07:16.520 --> 07:21.240]  very public nomination by a president of the most prosperous per capita country
[07:21.240 --> 07:25.760]  in the world South Korea juxtaposed and a perfect example of free market
[07:25.760 --> 07:31.840]  capitalism and the human spirit versus communism that murders and enslaves the
[07:31.840 --> 07:37.280]  human spirit and liberal heads are already exploding it was the clintons
[07:37.280 --> 07:43.960]  that kept that 60-year war going it was the clintons that transferred the
[07:43.960 --> 07:49.040]  uranium and the reactors and the delivery systems and now the heads are
[07:49.040 --> 07:53.080]  already exploding because the economy is coming back political correctness is
[07:53.080 --> 07:59.200]  being crushed we're starting to see new jobs come back to the country so many
[07:59.200 --> 08:03.880]  positive things are happening because the globalist were on purpose creating a
[08:03.880 --> 08:09.760]  strategy of crisis in the world so that they would have more control over
[08:09.760 --> 08:19.800]  humanity but now all of that is coming to a huge end but we're not there yet
[08:19.800 --> 08:22.840]  we're not to the finish line yet the globalists are going to try to stage
[08:22.840 --> 08:28.080]  false flags on the peninsula they're going to try to stage terror attacks
[08:28.080 --> 08:32.880]  here in the US and Europe to also blame Syria they're going to launch more fake
[08:32.880 --> 08:38.120]  chemical attacks by the way last week German TV British TV Russian TV French
[08:38.120 --> 08:45.000]  TV all independent Germany's biggest public television program went to Syria
[08:45.000 --> 08:50.280]  interviewed more than 15 kids who were on television dying of being
[08:50.280 --> 08:55.880]  nerve-gassed the very children and they said we were taken water was doused on
[08:55.880 --> 09:01.560]  us we were told to say we were sick for free food by the white helmets that are
[09:01.560 --> 09:09.360]  the ISIS organization their their their their PR group so we saw all of that
[09:09.360 --> 09:14.160]  taking place and and now it's all over the news it's confirmed now they flown
[09:14.160 --> 09:21.400]  the kids to Germany to France and to Russia and the children are on national
[09:21.400 --> 09:28.680]  news saying we were told to say we were hit by chemicals and then they have the
[09:28.680 --> 09:37.800]  video of the very children they said we're dying it is unbelievable and it's
[09:37.800 --> 09:42.720]  even breaking out on Al Jazeera the very children are in press conferences
[09:42.720 --> 09:45.600]  there's one on screen there's video of this I'm gonna cover more later it is
[09:45.600 --> 09:51.760]  unbelievable who were shown as basically dead with green paint on their faces
[09:51.760 --> 09:57.520]  claiming they died of nerve gas and they're all testifying to it ladies and
[09:57.520 --> 10:04.960]  gentlemen so the establishment does not know what to do right now well I'm here
[10:04.960 --> 10:10.920]  to tell you they are going to launch more of these yes there he is supposedly
[10:10.920 --> 10:16.040]  nerve gas and then there he is on Al Jazeera not being nerve-gassed and they've
[10:16.040 --> 10:20.840]  got 15 of these children have been flown they're all over national television in
[10:20.840 --> 10:25.000]  Europe to the credit of the Germans they're not suicidal there's their
[10:25.000 --> 10:29.240]  president said we're not involved in this cover-up not Merkel their chancellor
[10:29.240 --> 10:36.520]  their president have an upper lower house of their Reichstag and it's just
[10:36.520 --> 10:42.080]  incredible yeah the London Independent had this on April 17 13 days ago award
[10:42.080 --> 10:46.920]  winning journalist Robert Fist but now it's confirmed in triplicate the search
[10:46.920 --> 10:52.080]  for truth in the rubble of Duma and one doctor doubts over chemical attacks well
[10:52.080 --> 10:57.880]  that was 13 days ago now it's all confirmed and zero coverage here in the
[10:57.880 --> 11:05.320]  United States except for this broadcast think about that ladies and gentlemen
[11:05.320 --> 11:09.280]  Tucker Carlson was right we were right we were all right yeah who had the motive
[11:09.280 --> 11:16.400]  ISIS had been defeated except for being in Duma their last city the Russians are
[11:16.400 --> 11:22.320]  pulling out the US is pulling out we've declared victory ISIS wants to snatch
[11:22.320 --> 11:26.440]  victory from the jaws of defeat so magically there's a fourth chemical
[11:26.440 --> 11:30.960]  attack that they blamed on the Syrians when they've been caught in 52 chemical
[11:30.960 --> 11:35.880]  attacks ISIS has according to the New York Times in the seven-year war they've
[11:35.880 --> 11:43.360]  been caught 50 plus times red-handed even the New York Times admits that in a
[11:43.360 --> 11:49.520]  rare moment of truth and then now the rebels have been caught three separate
[11:49.520 --> 11:53.680]  times staging them this is the fourth time yeah look at this fake footage of
[11:53.680 --> 11:58.600]  your TV viewer the fake dr. Winx let's them know about the fall over he falls
[11:58.600 --> 12:03.080]  over between the kids cameras all zoom in you see the one kid who's been crying
[12:03.080 --> 12:10.520]  starts laughing stop shaking this ladies and gentlemen is the type of acting you
[12:10.520 --> 12:19.440]  would see in a third-grader play I went and saw my ten-year-old daughter in a
[12:19.440 --> 12:23.160]  play this weekend she did a great job at one of the lead roles but the point was
[12:23.160 --> 12:29.360]  it was still acting and it was ten times better than the acting we just saw over
[12:29.360 --> 12:32.640]  there does that mean chemical attacks don't happen no we just said 50 plus
[12:32.640 --> 12:39.960]  launched by ISIS killing thousands but does Assad have the motive no the old
[12:39.960 --> 12:50.400]  Roman saying the old Latin saying key bono key bono key bono who benefits what
[12:50.400 --> 12:59.760]  do the police always ask who's got the motive who's got contact who's got the
[12:59.760 --> 13:07.360]  capacity who's got the will well they know and 90 plus percent of violent
[13:07.360 --> 13:12.440]  crimes it's a man men have the will to kill people then you start going from
[13:12.440 --> 13:16.920]  there well keep on oh who has the background who's done this before who
[13:16.920 --> 13:21.440]  stands to gain who's been caught staging stuff before it's it's open and
[13:21.440 --> 13:29.160]  shut a moron could see this and the good news is it's all coming out so that's
[13:29.160 --> 13:32.440]  coming up because we got a bunch of the footage of this I just showed some of

[13:48.480 --> 13:51.840]  governments not for the big UN peacekeeper globalists that don't want
[13:51.840 --> 13:56.120]  anybody to be able to stand in their way incredible as Trump starts a peace
[13:56.120 --> 14:00.960]  race the Pope who has these giant walls around him but says you shouldn't have a
[14:00.960 --> 14:06.360]  wall around your house he jumps in with his latest grandstanding we're also

[14:15.120 --> 14:21.360]  but it's not we'll break down why such a huge transmission today now we learned
[14:21.360 --> 14:25.360]  six months ago when Mike Cernovich got the documents from Google Google
[14:25.360 --> 14:29.840]  confirmed they were theirs said it was true that they were spending millions of
[14:29.840 --> 14:36.200]  dollars to delist Alex Jones and why did they say because they said he had
[14:36.200 --> 14:41.680]  Ron Paul on and Ron Paul said the UN said the Syrian stage the chemical
[14:41.680 --> 14:48.120]  attack last April but that was all confirmed but they said this is fake
[14:48.120 --> 14:51.440]  news we wanting banned for this the contract we've been given by the
[14:51.440 --> 14:59.960]  government is to stop him that means Obama that's millions of dollars five
[14:59.960 --> 15:06.440]  million five million that was blacked out in the document we talked to them one
[15:06.440 --> 15:13.160]  of the people involved five million dollars to delist him for war so when
[15:13.160 --> 15:16.920]  they stage the next chemical attack we wouldn't be here showing you the truth
[15:16.920 --> 15:21.040]  we're trying to stop World War three here because I love my kids not because

[18:38.400 --> 18:42.480]  and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas

[19:24.480 --> 19:29.160]  classical 360 win this is the formula that I personally have been taking for
[19:29.160 --> 19:33.280]  over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it

[19:56.560 --> 20:01.520]  change our bodies with z-shield infowarslife.com
[20:01.520 --> 20:07.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:10.840 --> 20:21.880]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:21.880 --> 20:37.480]  if you read the United Nations Charter it has a universal declaration of human
[20:37.480 --> 20:49.160]  rights 31 passages 31 bills 31 amendments we have 10 in our first
[20:49.160 --> 20:54.880]  bill of rights and it's 31 you have every fabulous right under the sun just
[20:54.880 --> 20:58.080]  like North Korea has all these great rights of the old Soviet Union or
[20:58.080 --> 21:03.280]  communist China has all these great rights on paper but then when you get to
[21:03.280 --> 21:11.240]  article 30 and 31 it says anything that gets in the mission or gets in the way
[21:11.240 --> 21:21.920]  of the UN anything that they decide is against the Charter of their operations
[21:21.920 --> 21:31.720]  shut up by the Rockefellers in 1947 is known void and I've even read New
[21:31.720 --> 21:36.920]  York Times articles like a decade ago where the UN was mowing down whole
[21:36.920 --> 21:41.160]  villages in Africa because they wouldn't go off their ancestral property so they
[21:41.160 --> 21:45.920]  could turn it into a carbon sink so they have a gold mine next door they go
[21:45.920 --> 21:50.360]  oh but this is off limits to balance it out and so they would then take their
[21:50.360 --> 21:57.400]  property why do I raise that if you're a TV viewer you can see it behind me at
[21:57.400 --> 22:03.640]  that point it's a hundred and eighty feet tall you can see six foot tall
[22:03.640 --> 22:11.240]  people down there at the bottom then you do the math at its high point it's over
[22:11.240 --> 22:18.240]  a hundred and eighty feet tall yes the Vatican has a hundred and eighty foot
[22:18.240 --> 22:23.880]  wall at its tallest point when you go into the courtyard of the Basilica it's
[22:23.880 --> 22:27.960]  only sixty feet tall and they go oh but we let people in yes they have a
[22:27.960 --> 22:34.160]  courtyard a area where you go into a enclosed space where you're kettled in
[22:34.160 --> 22:41.640]  and that has 50 and 60 foot walls and that's footage I shot out of a hotel
[22:41.640 --> 22:46.400]  window a few years ago in Rome
[22:47.400 --> 22:51.360]  there may be a live feed we shot yeah that's from a live feed we've got some
[22:51.360 --> 23:02.320]  HD but imagine the Vatican has a hundred and eighty foot plus mega wall that
[23:02.320 --> 23:10.240]  stopped the Muslims when they invaded over a thousand years ago they were able
[23:10.240 --> 23:17.920]  to take most of Rome but they couldn't take the Vatican City there's also a big
[23:17.920 --> 23:21.760]  castle right across the street from it that's the Roman fortress they couldn't
[23:21.760 --> 23:33.320]  take that so they have hundred and eighty foot walls around the Vatican but
[23:33.320 --> 23:37.880]  the Pope says we should have no walls and that Trump is evil and that walls are
[23:37.880 --> 23:45.120]  of the devil well the question is then on info wars dot com Pope calls for
[23:45.120 --> 23:50.080]  worldwide ban on all weapons and he tweeted out do we really want peace
[23:50.080 --> 23:56.640]  and let's ban all these weapons so we don't have to live in fear of war what
[23:56.640 --> 24:02.080]  has been the UN plan ever since the Rockefellers publicly set it up it's to
[24:02.080 --> 24:07.640]  disarm everybody but the United Nations and a few member countries of the UN
[24:07.640 --> 24:16.280]  army which is now NATO which is the EU and who set up the EU officially in 1957
[24:16.280 --> 24:24.680]  with the Treaty of Rome it's 500 pages long you can pull it up on Wikipedia the
[24:24.680 --> 24:31.760]  Treaty of Rome beginning the EU and world government and who officiated over it
[24:31.760 --> 24:39.080]  but the Vatican and who are the official guards of the Vatican the Swiss Guard and
[24:39.080 --> 24:43.400]  why is Switzerland left alone and allowed to be neutral because that's where
[24:43.400 --> 24:51.120]  Rome the city of Rome puts its money so just like in the Hunger Games you've got
[24:51.120 --> 24:55.160]  the peacekeepers and their loving white uniforms and their loving giant armored
[24:55.160 --> 25:02.440]  vehicles they actually use the very same armored vehicles used by the UN and they
[25:02.440 --> 25:07.160]  come in and you're disarmed you don't have any weapons but they do because
[25:07.160 --> 25:14.840]  they're what they're peacekeepers now the Treaty of London began the steel
[25:14.840 --> 25:24.080]  accord in 1947 but the Treaty of Rome expanded at one decade later and has
[25:24.080 --> 25:30.760]  seen as the beginning of the EU but when people said this is a regional
[25:30.760 --> 25:34.520]  government Hitler had the plan for the EU they'd say oh shut up I remember
[25:34.520 --> 25:40.160]  being on air in 1996 when they were still saying it was a conspiracy theory in
[25:40.160 --> 25:47.800]  the news if you said the EU was going to be a country and that it was then gonna
[25:47.800 --> 25:51.440]  absorb the nation-states or that would ever have its own army all of that has
[25:51.440 --> 25:57.680]  now happened and just last year they threatened Italian naval ships that are
[25:57.680 --> 26:01.840]  stopping the hundreds of boats a day that come the 90 miles across from
[26:01.840 --> 26:12.720]  Tripoli, North Africa into the Mediterranean and over to Italy, Greece,
[26:12.720 --> 26:20.000]  Macedonia, Albania, you name it and the EU said we are launching our own Navy
[26:20.000 --> 26:27.360]  and we will physically stop you. Who do you think's running the so-called refugee
[26:27.360 --> 26:35.440]  vagabond van wagon that just hit the California border yesterday? Our
[26:35.440 --> 26:39.120]  reporters are about to be there Millie Weaver and Gavin Wentz. Why do you think
[26:39.120 --> 26:42.960]  that happened? Because they're opening up a corridor and Mexico agrees let
[26:42.960 --> 26:46.360]  anybody in the world get on the trains come through as long as they don't get
[26:46.360 --> 26:50.800]  off and flood the US just like they started a decade ago a corridor through
[26:50.800 --> 26:54.240]  Turkey and now corridors across the Mediterranean they're opening the
[26:54.240 --> 26:58.080]  corridors letting you know get here overwhelm things and they say we're
[26:58.080 --> 27:02.480]  coming here to escape poverty we're coming here for safety but how do you
[27:02.480 --> 27:08.320]  escape the poverty and not get vetted in any way like Ellis Island and then get
[27:08.320 --> 27:12.360]  indoctrinated into the very globalist socialism that brought your countries
[27:12.360 --> 27:18.040]  like Venezuela, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Cuba down how do you escape the
[27:18.040 --> 27:22.560]  Islamic tyranny of North Africa and then you come here but you're so brainwashed
[27:22.560 --> 27:30.800]  you just recreate it as we know they're doing this is a planned takeover this is
[27:30.800 --> 27:35.280]  a planned operation this is going on hundreds of boats a day are hitting
[27:35.280 --> 27:44.560]  Spain hundreds of boats a day and Soros brags he's funding him and now it's at

[33:31.400 --> 33:39.200]  austin texas broadcasting worldwide from the info wars.com studios
[33:42.120 --> 33:51.160]  well we thought that the globalist pope the black pope the Jesuit pope couldn't
[33:51.160 --> 33:55.360]  top himself when he said Europe shouldn't have borders the US shouldn't
[33:55.360 --> 34:00.400]  have borders we shouldn't have walls when he's behind 180 plus foot walls but
[34:00.400 --> 34:05.520]  he's topped it pope calls for worldwide ban on all weapons but of course the
[34:05.520 --> 34:10.880]  United Nations they're gonna keep theirs but will he get the Vatican guards to
[34:10.880 --> 34:15.120]  lay down their weapons just like Hollywood's always wanting our guns
[34:15.120 --> 34:19.760]  but they've got bodyguards like the film we all saw at the Oscars this year
[34:19.760 --> 34:24.480]  where they've got armed SWAT teams and guys with fully auto weapons strutting
[34:24.480 --> 34:32.720]  around to protect them but boy do they want our guns simply insane ladies and
[34:32.720 --> 34:39.960]  gentlemen that article is on info wars.com and news wars.com right now
[34:39.960 --> 34:48.880]  okay that ties in to our next report people being able to protect themselves
[34:48.880 --> 34:56.320]  and we're gonna go to this dramatic footage here in just a few minutes and
[34:56.320 --> 35:02.440]  then I'm gonna tie it into what's happening in the UK and in the UN where
[35:02.440 --> 35:08.760]  they are openly trying to get Islamists into all the positions of power and
[35:08.760 --> 35:15.160]  again this is a plan to force us under Islamic control because there are a
[35:15.160 --> 35:20.200]  billion 300 million Muslims right now they're having on average six children
[35:20.200 --> 35:25.080]  so it's estimated even by the United Nations World Health Organization there
[35:25.080 --> 35:38.760]  will be 3 billion Muslims by 2030 that's 12 years away 3 billion Chinese
[35:38.760 --> 35:43.000]  population has leveled off Indian populations leveling off Africa's
[35:43.000 --> 35:48.280]  population still growing some Latin American some but the big explosion is
[35:48.280 --> 35:56.400]  in Islam a religion and the globalists have decided to go with it because it's
[35:56.400 --> 36:03.200]  authoritarian they're targeting Christianity and God help us when you
[36:03.200 --> 36:06.600]  explain the Muslims why don't you give up your Sharia law and all your radical
[36:06.600 --> 36:14.280] ism and have a reformation why are you trying to come here why are you trying
[36:14.280 --> 36:24.400]  to come here to make it Islamic but you're fleeing Islam and you've got the
[36:24.400 --> 36:29.120]  EU saying they want 200 million Muslims to travel from North Africa to
[36:29.120 --> 36:40.120]  Middle East by again 2030 unbelievable and folks they don't convert the ones
[36:40.120 --> 36:44.360]  that do get acid thrown in their faces or if you try to have women go to
[36:44.360 --> 36:48.000]  college or have rock and roll music on like Saddam you go with Rome of the
[36:48.000 --> 36:54.440]  West so the demographics have been looked at ladies and gentlemen you are to be
[36:54.440 --> 37:01.280]  conquered by a globalist technocratic technocracy that oversees Muslims
[37:01.280 --> 37:05.640]  taking over the planet where we all have to bow to their Sharia law under
[37:05.640 --> 37:09.280]  political correctness that's why the left is allied with it so I George Soros
[37:09.280 --> 37:18.040]  funds it it's here and this is the fact and you go to an airport anywhere in the
[37:18.040 --> 37:23.440]  US it's it's women in burkas checking you and you go to Europe it's the same
[37:23.440 --> 37:26.960]  thing and then you notice wait the police chiefs in London and the police
[37:26.960 --> 37:35.840]  chiefs and all these big London cities in German cities and Dutch cities and the
[37:35.840 --> 37:42.720]  mayors and the security chiefs and the intelligence heads and now the UK's new
[37:42.720 --> 37:48.320]  immigration border chief Pakistan Muslim and you go to Mall of America this is
[37:48.320 --> 37:54.400]  footage shot there just last year this this is they brought in something like
[37:54.400 --> 38:02.320]  a half million Somalis into Minnesota in the last 30 years and the point is
[38:02.320 --> 38:07.120]  every time they stab somebody or kill somebody the media just goes we love it
[38:07.120 --> 38:13.160]  that's a quote and all I'm saying is man I don't want to live in Somalia and if
[38:13.160 --> 38:19.480]  you're gonna come here don't sit there and lecture me when I'm in a cab with
[38:19.480 --> 38:24.720]  you as has happened or don't lecture my son who takes ubers he says dad it's
[38:24.720 --> 38:28.080]  crazy he goes want to take ubers to jiu-jitsu or whatever he hadn't got his
[38:28.080 --> 38:32.320]  car yet he's 15 I let him take those when he's exercising he says I get
[38:32.320 --> 38:37.080]  proselytized to every few weeks by Muslims and he goes are all of them
[38:37.080 --> 38:44.160]  Muslims and I said son this is the alarmist vacation this is the Islam
[38:44.160 --> 38:54.120]  vacation of our country of the world and you know if I went to Somalia I'd be
[38:54.120 --> 38:57.920]  kidnapped in five minutes and killed or sold for ransom imagine if a half
[38:57.920 --> 39:03.840]  million Americans moved to Mogadishu and the Somalis walked into their mall
[39:03.840 --> 39:07.920]  which of course they don't have that they sell women on slave blocks and slavery
[39:07.920 --> 39:11.720]  still goes on there and it's hellish and everybody's basically starving to death
[39:11.720 --> 39:17.600]  their main business is pirating but that's their culture so it's okay but
[39:17.600 --> 39:26.840]  imagine if I showed up and said hey I I'm here they'd say you'd die but
[39:26.840 --> 39:33.560]  instead everywhere I go to get a rent car every time now only Somalis are
[39:33.560 --> 39:39.080]  running at Hawaii Denver Seattle
[39:40.520 --> 39:45.200]  everywhere and the Somalis sit there behind a counter and their mouths are
[39:45.200 --> 39:51.800]  hanging open that Alex Jones is there and I don't know what to say because I
[39:51.800 --> 39:55.720]  don't dislike them as people but man listen you're being put in the
[39:55.720 --> 40:02.080]  infrastructure to run things you notice the CPS workers in these hundreds of
[40:02.080 --> 40:06.560]  British towns are mainly Muslims and then above them are pedophile networks
[40:06.560 --> 40:10.520]  and then they deliver the children to them because it's part of it's part of
[40:10.520 --> 40:16.920]  Islam and it's now finally all over the British news that okay these people were
[40:16.920 --> 40:20.440]  right decades ago that so this was going on and there are tens of thousands of
[40:20.440 --> 40:25.720]  missing girls because in Islam women wear hoods over their heads and aren't
[40:25.720 --> 40:28.000]  really allowed out of the house without a male minder because if you're by
[40:28.000 --> 40:33.320]  yourself you're fair game to have a bag thrown over you and you are put in the
[40:33.320 --> 40:41.800]  to a caravan and you are shipped to whoever will buy you and this is what
[40:41.800 --> 40:49.040]  liberal feminist women have a kuckle fetish for I can't tell you how many
[40:49.040 --> 40:55.240]  women I know that I have friends that have dated women models you name it who
[40:55.240 --> 40:58.960]  got beat up and cut by their Muslim boyfriend and finally got deprogrammed
[40:58.960 --> 41:02.440]  and got out of it before they got him to fly into the Middle East because once
[41:02.440 --> 41:07.920]  they get you to fly out of here you're chained up the basement baby so we're
[41:07.920 --> 41:12.760]  talking about a hideous serial killer level culture I'm sorry it's fact I
[41:12.760 --> 41:16.320]  didn't want to have wars with it I didn't want to destabilize it I didn't
[41:16.320 --> 41:21.160]  want to knock out the reasonable countries like Gaddafi and like Assad and
[41:21.160 --> 41:26.080]  like Saddam that those are nice guys compared to radical Islam they had
[41:26.080 --> 41:30.880]  radical Islam under their foot they're going we kick housing mubarak out and
[41:30.880 --> 41:35.680]  put this crap in so when we come back to I'm getting into our right to defend

[44:18.520 --> 44:23.440]  in the atmosphere and so in our own search to get the purest form we
[44:23.440 --> 44:27.720]  discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that
[44:27.720 --> 44:31.080]  they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers they used
[44:31.080 --> 44:35.040]  to make drugs and once they figure out there's a market they start jacking up
[44:35.040 --> 44:40.880]  the price but we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out hopefully just
[44:40.880 --> 44:43.680]  like the last time this happened a few years ago it's not an issue and we do

[48:08.080 --> 48:11.840]  hillar is in the creepy with six tough men
[48:11.840 --> 48:27.920]  as we came we saw he died
[48:27.920 --> 48:34.240]  she smells man i'm told her and obama just stink
[48:34.240 --> 48:42.320]  obama and hillary both smell like sulfur there's a guy on the radio who apparently
[48:42.320 --> 48:45.760]  drums on the show frequently he said me and hillary are demons
[48:45.760 --> 48:51.200]  said we smell like sulfur ain't that something i have never seen or smelled
[48:51.200 --> 48:54.640]  any woman like that ever people are telling me she smells who could not
[48:54.640 --> 49:03.440]  notice someone who smelled that bad
[49:03.440 --> 49:07.440]  my spirit gets close to that evil and i feel it go
[49:07.440 --> 49:12.560]  i i i
[49:12.560 --> 49:16.320]  we'll start the steps in a craft we don't even notice
[49:16.320 --> 49:22.080]  and it's up rising up against the millions of pointed people
[49:22.080 --> 49:27.440]  if the fair was happening i'm so pissed
[49:27.440 --> 49:34.960]  we're going to stab your daughter at the mall
[49:34.960 --> 49:42.480]  we're going to stab your wife your son
[49:42.480 --> 49:46.960]  we're going to stab you with a bullet tonight and then the police chief is
[49:46.960 --> 49:52.560]  gonna say we love our smiley we love our
[49:52.560 --> 49:57.360]  muslims oh they're so good oh they're so sweet
[49:57.360 --> 50:04.080]  i was watching fox as i worked out this morning and they had the police chief
[50:04.080 --> 50:06.640]  on making excuses from that town of minnesota
[50:06.640 --> 50:09.840]  and they had the fox news host this is the fair and balance channel
[50:09.840 --> 50:12.800]  going donald trump really stepped in at this time
[50:12.800 --> 50:16.560]  he said it was a bombing before it had officially been called a bombing
[50:16.560 --> 50:29.440]  and hillary's on him and she's got some really good points
[50:29.440 --> 50:34.000]  now let's be clear we've got a plan just like the one they carried out
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.880]  starting about a decade ago in europe to advertise
[50:36.880 --> 50:42.880]  soros and unfunded groups to caravan in through turkey through syria
[50:42.880 --> 50:46.240]  and that caravan began an entire invasion
[50:46.240 --> 50:52.640]  seven years ago of syria itself and you've got the zodiac boats coming
[50:52.640 --> 50:55.200]  across the Mediterranean from north africa into europe
[50:55.200 --> 50:59.200]  more than 10 million military aged men just the last six seven years
[50:59.200 --> 51:04.080]  have gotten in to europe and are now carrying out jihad
[51:04.080 --> 51:08.800]  raping killing stealing you name it well now they're opening up
[51:08.800 --> 51:13.520]  a caravan with another soros unfunded group
[51:13.520 --> 51:16.800]  into the united states now obama already had these caravans
[51:16.800 --> 51:20.800]  up even four years ago he was calling it you know children's migration but only
[51:20.800 --> 51:24.800]  17 percent were under the age of 18 even our own
[51:24.800 --> 51:29.120]  border patrol and ice admits but now they're opening it back up to humanize
[51:29.120 --> 51:32.640]  a poor woman with her kids and all this to then fully break it
[51:32.640 --> 51:37.360]  and then no one will say hey why isn't mexico taking these people
[51:37.360 --> 51:41.120]  no it's all how mexico is going to create a corridor
[51:41.120 --> 51:46.000]  via their railways to bring folks up who've now arrived as you see as a tv
[51:46.000 --> 51:50.960]  viewer cbs is covering thousands and thousands of people
[51:50.960 --> 51:55.840]  saying we deserve to be in to open it up so these images can be shown
[51:55.840 --> 52:00.400]  in nicaragua el salvador venezuela you name it
[52:00.400 --> 52:05.840]  guatemala collapsing but not collapsing into mexico because there's
[52:05.840 --> 52:08.800]  already that pressure on the southern border and mexico is a lot richer than
[52:08.800 --> 52:11.440]  those countries believe it or not they're in the top few percent of third
[52:11.440 --> 52:13.280]  world countries they're almost a first world country
[52:13.280 --> 52:16.480]  in many areas so mexico isn't going to take this
[52:16.480 --> 52:21.040]  they're sending these people here with the idea that we've got to accept it and
[52:21.040 --> 52:26.000]  then if we don't let the men were evil were bad folks
[52:26.000 --> 52:29.520]  and it's now come out that these type of immigrants are twice as likely to
[52:29.520 --> 52:32.240]  commit crime they've tried to spin it and say they're all innocent they're all
[52:32.240 --> 52:35.920]  good a very large portion are nice people but
[52:35.920 --> 52:39.440]  there's a minority that are extremely criminal
[52:39.440 --> 52:42.320]  most of them that are in that minority that are extremely criminal
[52:42.320 --> 52:48.480]  are fleeing justice already they're mentally ill or they're psychotic and
[52:48.480 --> 52:52.160]  they're coming up here or their destitute and california is already
[52:52.160 --> 52:54.800]  collapsing but california is saying come on in
[52:54.800 --> 52:59.040]  come on in come on in now notice it's a pincer attack
[52:59.040 --> 53:02.480]  a two-sided attack the globalists are going to bring in latin american
[53:02.480 --> 53:06.640]  socialist brainwashed people predominantly socialist
[53:06.640 --> 53:11.360]  they show up in socialist california origan washington
[53:11.360 --> 53:15.360]  they're then taught to hate the country their brainwash
[53:15.360 --> 53:18.960]  they're then put into the democratic party machine they're kept as a permanent
[53:18.960 --> 53:22.400]  underclass boom brought into the universities
[53:22.400 --> 53:26.880]  to expand the hate machine and the whole anti-white anti-el-Norte program
[53:26.880 --> 53:29.840]  if most of them weren't races before they will be
[53:29.840 --> 53:37.360]  that's the left attack of the left-hand pincer the right pincer
[53:37.360 --> 53:41.200]  again a pincer comes together like a claw like a nutcracker
[53:41.200 --> 53:46.960]  is the islamist system coming in with its huge demographic boom to be managed
[53:46.960 --> 53:50.320]  by the same socialist so the socialist left is allied with islam
[53:50.320 --> 53:54.000]  islam's allied with them you know the throwing gays off buildings and
[53:54.000 --> 53:57.600]  enslaving women because it's part of a larger globalist
[53:57.600 --> 54:00.800]  takeover that the globalists are directing and the globalists admit this
[54:00.800 --> 54:04.720]  is their plan but now all over the world people know it they understand it
[54:04.720 --> 54:09.680]  now the pope's saying open borders but not again with his 180 foot walls
[54:09.680 --> 54:14.160]  he also says turn in all your guns today but he's still going to have armed
[54:14.160 --> 54:20.240]  guards and the story is out of uh houston armed
[54:20.240 --> 54:23.520]  home invaders pistol went mother and threatened her children
[54:23.520 --> 54:28.640]  as they ransacked the house now this was only in the metro out of the UK
[54:28.640 --> 54:31.840]  and a few houston publications i saw almost no coverage of this over the
[54:31.840 --> 54:36.560]  weekend and why is it because it's white people
[54:36.560 --> 54:39.920]  being pistol whipped and beaten by black people
[54:39.920 --> 54:44.000]  who are clearly racist and hateful now imagine if
[54:44.000 --> 54:47.520]  white people were beating a black woman and black children there'd be riots in
[54:47.520 --> 54:50.400]  the streets this would be on every channel but because it doesn't fit the
[54:50.400 --> 54:54.080]  racial narrative you read the articles it says nothing about them being black
[54:54.080 --> 54:59.280]  men and their mask falling off because they're such idiots again this should
[54:59.280 --> 55:03.040]  be decried and and and it's obviously racially
[55:03.040 --> 55:06.560]  directed in houston they had the new black panther party saying if you're
[55:06.560 --> 55:09.600]  black go out and rob white people that's bit of the news
[55:09.600 --> 55:13.440]  so let's go ahead and roll some of this footage again it's very dramatic i've
[55:13.440 --> 55:16.400]  tweeted it at real alex jones of your radio listener i want to see it here it
[55:16.400 --> 55:27.360]  is
[55:46.400 --> 55:48.400]  Please stop.
[55:48.400 --> 55:50.400]  Please stop.
[55:50.400 --> 55:52.400]  Please stop.
[55:52.400 --> 55:54.400]  You guys please don't go.
[55:54.400 --> 55:56.400]  Please watch them.
[55:56.400 --> 55:58.400]  Watch them.
[55:58.400 --> 56:00.400]  Watch them.
[56:00.400 --> 56:02.400]  Watch them.
[56:02.400 --> 56:04.400]  I don't know.
[56:04.400 --> 56:06.400]  Get her.
[56:06.400 --> 56:08.400]  Let's go.
[56:08.400 --> 56:10.400]  Put the two of them on the table.
[56:10.400 --> 56:12.400]  Put the two of them on the table.
[56:12.400 --> 56:14.400]  Please.
[56:14.400 --> 56:16.400]  I'm not talking about the diseases.
[56:16.400 --> 56:18.400]  Too many.
[56:18.400 --> 56:20.400]  process kills.
[56:20.400 --> 56:22.400]  Only one out of a thousand people get caught on video.
[56:22.400 --> 56:24.400]  They have cameras
[56:24.400 --> 56:26.400]  a lot of the new security what.
[56:26.400 --> 56:28.400]  Trigger.
[56:28.400 --> 56:30.400]  when you're coming in and out.
[56:30.400 --> 56:32.400]  I don't like Big Brother,
[56:32.400 --> 56:33.920]  I'm under such threat I
[56:33.920 --> 56:36.400]  have multiple systems back up you name it.
[56:40.400 --> 56:42.960]  They can't send in one of their teams,
[56:42.960 --> 56:44.960]  Little kids have the instinct to try to get away
[56:45.720 --> 56:49.360]  Again, we're talking about black racist thugs beating white people
[56:49.600 --> 56:52.680]  But where is the media because if you had white people doing this
[56:52.840 --> 56:57.980]  It would be the end of the world cities would burn now. I know most black people aren't racist
[56:58.520 --> 57:03.920]  But the media is covering up stuff like this so they can create the illusion that only whites commit crimes against blacks
[57:04.120 --> 57:08.540]  When the leftist media pushing this narrative has created a climate where for every?
[57:09.680 --> 57:11.680]  white person that's attacked
[57:11.680 --> 57:16.640]  By a black person. It's 12 to 1 12 white people are attacked
[57:17.200 --> 57:23.720]  By black people for every time a black person is attacked by a white person 12 to 1 on average
[57:25.080 --> 57:27.080]  Now let me say the obvious
[57:27.720 --> 57:28.960]  My god
[57:28.960 --> 57:32.720]  You talk about getting I don't care if you're white black polka dotted. I
[57:33.280 --> 57:35.880]  Catch you in my house. You are going down
[57:35.880 --> 57:39.000]  You're a debtor than a doornail and that woman needs to go get her concealed carry
[57:39.000 --> 57:44.640]  She's to have her firearm and next time she sees something like that going on smiling your house with weapons grease them
[57:45.000 --> 57:49.040]  Kill them dead in a hammer. That's what the second amendment. It's all about we have a right to it
[57:49.160 --> 57:51.840]  They use their media to assassinate real news
[57:52.160 --> 57:56.200]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler
[57:56.360 --> 58:03.400]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again
[58:03.400 --> 58:07.160]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance
[58:07.160 --> 58:14.360]  All to make them march make them protest make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia
[58:14.760 --> 58:22.880]  To smash windows burn cars shut down interstates and airports bully and terrorize the law abiding until the only option
[58:23.040 --> 58:28.920]  Left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness and when that happens
[58:28.920 --> 58:31.480]  They'll use it as an excuse for their outrage
[58:31.480 --> 58:39.040]  The only way we stop this the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this
[58:39.240 --> 58:48.360]  Violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth. I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place
[58:49.880 --> 58:55.960]  After years of research working with top developers here in the United States with the latest cutting-edge science
[58:56.160 --> 58:58.520]  We are rolling out three new
[58:58.520 --> 59:02.760]  Digestive gut aids one of them is a powerful
[59:03.680 --> 59:08.600]  Pro-digestive enzyme carnivore for being able to break down meat other proteins better
[59:08.600 --> 59:11.360]  And then the other two is a powerful
[59:12.240 --> 59:16.240]  50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in
[59:16.880 --> 59:22.040]  Floralife advanced restoration, and we also have an every day extremely affordable
[59:22.040 --> 59:29.600]  Floralife every day maintenance, but all of these are the very cutting edge top of the line
[59:30.200 --> 59:33.200]  probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely
[59:33.600 --> 59:40.120]  Affordable price that is my goal here is to bring you the very best at the lowest price
[59:40.320 --> 59:43.240]  When you purchase it and then for store.com, you know
[59:43.240 --> 59:52.320]  You are also financing the attack on the globalist and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide
[59:52.320 --> 01:00:13.880]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:28.960]  You want to stop tyranny well, so does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's alex jones
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:37.160]  So imagine you come home from work with your three children and there are
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:44.000]  More on idiot dirt bags with their pants hanging down almost at their knees
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.360]  Pointing guns at your three-year-old children and beating them upside the head
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.040]  And
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:57.360]  You've got more on idiots that don't even know how to keep masks on
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:04.240]  Screaming at the women and this footage is just now coming out in court this happened back on February 28th
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:10.160]  Armed home invaders pistol whip mother and threaten her children as they ran sack of house
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:16.240]  How can you not say we have a right to weapons when the criminals are only going to have them if you take them?
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:22.240]  They took the guns 20 years ago in England. They've now got a higher crime rate than New York City now. They're trying to ban
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:25.640]  Of course
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.640]  in everybody's face
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.240]  They're trying to
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:34.000]  Ban knives in England or make you get a license for them
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:41.600]  Horrifying video footage shows four masked home invaders pistol whip a pregnant woman and point guns at her children after
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:43.800]  smashing into their house
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:51.440]  The disturbing surveillance footage was captured at the family's home in East Harris County near use of Texas on February 28th
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.040]  after barging into the home the two men demand money and
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:02:02.080]  valuables from the homeowner seemingly oblivious to the cries of fear from her terrified children while they slap them and hit them
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:05.400]  the shout come on wears the money and
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:12.560]  Flapping the mothers across the back of the head with a handgun as she screams my kids my kids
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.280]  She tries to comfort her children and cradle them
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:20.600]  You know who's that black reporter
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:26.720]  She's the same one that you know it said all poor white people when somebody brought up a lot of these racial attacks are happening to folks
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.720]  We're in make America great hats
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.800]  People are saying racial slurs while they beat them or even just white people period are being told
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:37.960]  You know you voted for Trump's we're gonna beat you up. She said all poor white people. What about these poor white people again?
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:39.960]  white people have been so dehumanized and
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:46.400]  Most white people are not racist that's actually they're guilty and they have a guilty conscience even though they didn't do anything
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:50.160]  But instead now that guilt is turning to anger and it's going to turn into racism
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:56.360]  So the media needs to start exposing this instead of covering it up because that only creates more anger
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:00.520]  But see they want people to be divided in this country. That's the plan
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:07.200]  She tries to comfort her children and cradle them yelling we just
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:11.160]  Gotta let it go. They're just going to take something
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:15.160]  But they are too distraught by the stress of the ordeal and soon begin to scream again
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.160]  They are seen going upstairs
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:20.440]  And the property and ransacking it before
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:28.160]  Dragging property back down the stairs and removing it during the incident one of the two suspects mass slips off with Harris County Sheriff's Office
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:33.760]  Hoping the gaffe may be sufficient for someone to be able to identify him
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.640]  But they don't say it's a
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:43.160]  Black male till later, which is actually a crime in the media in Sweden to say what color somebody is seriously
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:46.000]  They shared the video on social media
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:50.880]  Riding investigators say the first suspect is a black male approximately six wine weighs 165 libs
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:53.240]  And is around 25 years of age wearing a gray hoodie
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:04:00.240]  The second person is a black male 511 150 lips. So we're going to go to break with playing this video
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:20.240]  Let's go ahead and roll that video again
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:32.240]  Oh
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:48.480]  We need a second amendment
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:52.680]  Whether you're black whether you're white whatever you are you have a right to defend yourself from this garbage
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.680]  We don't want to live like they do in Chicago in Houston. I
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:58.000]  I
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  Want to plow into all of this
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:05.800]  Then I'm gonna spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:14.500]  When you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from info or store
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.880]  Com you are funding the revolution. I mean I cannot say it any clear
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:24.200]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at info or store calm
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:29.920]  I don't want to thank everybody that has but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:36.480]  Atomic iodine in it. You cannot beat that for children and adults. We've got the best mouthwash designed by dr. Jones
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:43.440]  That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well info wars life calm or triple a two five three three one three nine
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.440]  And your purses of the products
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:50.760]  Stands with us stands with America stands with Trump stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:55.560]  And that's who they are and they know we know who they are and they're coming back against it. So we need your support
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:13.280]  We now take you live to the central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:23.560]  Rallying Patriots worldwide You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:33.400]  We're now into the second hour we have got so much to get to this hour and tend to open the phones up as well
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.320]  We have
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:46.120]  The pope coming out and saying it's time to disarm everyone, but he doesn't mean disarm the UN or NATO
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:48.960]  Or the Vatican police or the Swiss Guard
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:56.040]  He just means you when he says you can't have a wall around your house or you can't have a wall around your country's border
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:59.120]  That's only for you
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:03.840]  Because the Pope's a globalist that stories up on info wars.com
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:05.840]  And
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:14.680]  It ties in with UK's new immigration chief a Pakistani Muslim this from Dan Lyman and info wars Europe
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:21.840]  The son of Pakistani immigrants has been named the United Kingdom's new home secretary
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:28.440]  At his predecessor resigned amidst allegations. He was seeking to increase deportations of illegal immigrants
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:31.200]  That's right
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:37.760]  Sajad Javad is being hailed as the country's first ethnic minority to hold the position
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:41.680]  Which entails oversight of immigration and citizenship affairs
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:45.760]  national security and policing and it follows the same pattern in
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:48.040]  Western Europe
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:55.440]  and other areas just like the Islamic mayors they're putting in all the news last week where the Muslim grooming gangs work with the
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:00.480]  Child protective services in the major towns to actually kidnap children for the pedophile elite
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:05.080]  What we're gonna have a strategy in place that does something that
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:10.680]  Previous home secretary set out last week when she made a statement to parliament to ensure that we have
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:13.280]  an immigration policy that's fair
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:18.480]  Treats people respect and with decency, which means don't let conservatives or libertarians even travel to the country
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:24.080]  Don't let nationalists leave the country. That's and let in as many unvetted Muslims as possible
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:30.660]  That would one of his most urgent tasks to make sure that we look carefully at the policy and make sure it achieves just that
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:33.000]  fairness
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  Isn't that just sweet and nice following the 2017 Islamic terrorist massacre of Westminster Bridge in London
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.320]  Javad told
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:47.880]  attendees of Muslim news awards for excellence that Muslims cannot also be murderers I
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:52.920]  Know religious scholar many years have passed since I attended the Quran as a child
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:59.880]  But even I know that there's no justification for what happened in Paris or the kind of indiscriminate slaughter that came to Westminster last week
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:05.480]  What a nice guy or it's under the Quran. They can tell you they're your friend and then kill you
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:11.720]  All I know is the globalist plan to Islamify the entire world
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:16.560]  Now there's a bunch of news I haven't gotten to yet
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:20.520]  But one thing that's so big. I need to cover it again. I
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:26.200]  Pointed out yesterday that if they're gonna give a peace prize to Obama for launching a bunch of wars
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:31.480]  Then Trump for getting peace on the Korean Peninsula very very close and getting them to get ready to sign a deal to end the war
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:34.120]  That enough right there deserves a peace prize, but again
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:36.720]  The Nobel Prize is a joke
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:43.800]  We'll be looking at that and there's a very interesting article here that is so
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:51.600]  Revealing that I don't normally read a whole article on air, but I ought to read it. Just to give you the bizarre logic
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:52.840]  and
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:56.520]  Really the Alice in Wonderland tea party nature
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:03.280]  Of this particular story out of Splinter news by Cleo Chang
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:11.480]  Treat Kanye West like a conspiracy thirst and they go on to say he's dangerous like Alex Jones and
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:19.720]  That what he's saying is is is bad and spreading and so he should just be ignored and are basically banned
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:26.960]  What Kanye saying is we have thought police in this country trying to bully people and that he supports open free thought and open discussion
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:30.480]  It's not about Kanye West whether you love him or hating
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:40.760]  It's about the fact that he's absolutely right about free expression being under attack, but they say that's a conspiracy theory
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.360]  But then call for him to be shut up
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.920]  Don't listen to Kanye. He's crazy. Nobody's trying to restrict your speech. That's why we need to shut him up
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:11:00.920]  And of course, I'm all over the article. This is amazing a
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:08.920]  Tax on free speech are happening all over the world in Europe. They've basically banned criticizing Islam. They arrest people
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:10.920]  Police chiefs get fired. They talk about
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:14.920]  90 plus percent of the rapes in Stockholm being Islamic
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:21.920]  There's the most dramatic set of footage that is still online last time I checked we saved it of women going to these diversity rallies
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:24.920]  In Germany and Sweden and other areas
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:33.920]  And like 50 guys will grab a really supermodel looking woman and grab her and hold her legs two guys hold each leg two guys hold each arm
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:38.920]  They're crying and they gang rape them for hours and the cops are 30 yards away just looking
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:45.920]  And and the women are then interviewed later. They go. Well, they hurt me. I'm bleeding. I'm really hurt, but I'm still not racist
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:49.920]  I want more to come. Please don't leave just last week a woman got gang raped
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:56.920]  Ain't only and she was in the news saying well, I went to the refugee center to show them. I'm not racist and I just still don't want them deported
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:01.920]  I understand their victims. That's why they rape me in there. I mean, I'm sorry to talk like that
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:07.920]  This is one this week refugee rapes 12 year old girl didn't know it was illegal
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:10.920]  That's in Sweden too
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:17.920]  And then the courts say well, we're not going to give you any jail time. It's part of your religion
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:25.920]  And I'm only pointing out that we've turned our backs on them
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:31.920]  And I'm only pointing out that we've turned our life force off we've turned our self-preservation off
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:37.920]  And then you see the footage that I've tweeted out at real Alex Jones. I'm gonna have it reposted in fours.com
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:44.920]  This is soon as we take those last I guess two segments and put them out so people can see
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:50.920]  Two black men robbing and beating women and children and you say well, that's not racist. You don't know they meant it because they're white
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:57.920]  You're right. I don't but if it was two white men beating black children and black women, you'd have riots in the streets nationwide
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:03.920]  Well, why don't you have that because it's so rare and the crime statistics are there in her effect
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:07.920]  Migrant who participated in 20 man gang rape abduction
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:13.920]  Tells police it was fun. Yeah, yeah, pull that one up
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:20.920]  By the way, I watch this beautiful woman being gang raped
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:26.920]  About a year and a half ago we played some of the footage but but blurred it and zoomed in on her face
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:33.920]  And it is so haunting the blood coming out of her mouth and she's crying
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:38.920]  And she's being thrust over and over again. They're hammering her and she's she's just is like panic
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:42.920]  You still kind of wake up and struggle and then pass back out and she just I can't believe it's happening
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:51.920]  And it's like it makes me think of my wife or my daughters or my mother or any other women and it's just so fundamental that we don't act like that in the west
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:55.920]  This is the west with chivalry. We're being turned into animals here
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:02.920]  But the but the media and Hollywood and George Soros and the universities they tell us we're the place that treats women bad
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:07.920]  Yeah, that's it. That's another one. I hadn't seen there's so many of these. I can't look at it. Take it down
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:15.920]  You know what show some of it just don't show the raping because they'll try to censor us and say we're showing inappropriate stuff
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:20.920]  And by the way, these are popular on leftist sites. That's not the one I've there's hundreds of them
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:25.920]  There's one where the woman's held up by the arms and there's a line of guys 20d
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:31.920]  And they are just I mean you talk about brutal savage raping and the police do nothing
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:34.920]  You see that Islamic spay prank right there
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:41.920]  That woman fought so she didn't get raped. Yeah, that was that's the only reason that's still online
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:44.920]  That woman fought him. She didn't make it easy
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:49.920]  Let me tell you something. I see 20 guys raping a woman. I'm not gonna say what I'm gonna do
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:56.920]  But it's I just can't handle it and then I'm told I'm the bad guy by the stinking disgusting evil Hollywood crime syndicate
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:59.920]  We're going to break. I'm gonna give the number out and come back

[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:08.920]  They're trying to bully and kick us off the year right now as you know Soros the Clintons are all suing us
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:13.920]  And and it's just does America know your rights are all under attack. They're coming for you and your family

[01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:26.920]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:32.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a major global political realignment taking place
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:37.920]  Trump is being nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize by the South Korean President
[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.920]  That broke today, they're agreeing to a peace deal
[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:46.920]  You've got the Pope calling for everyone to turn in their firearms, but the UN and the globalists and he won't give up the Swiss Guard
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:50.920]  But a global peace race has begun launched by President Trump
[01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:59.920]  Meanwhile, in Tehran, the dictators there, the Ayatollahs are about to start testing atomic bombs
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:06.920]  The word is they had atomic weapons a long time ago, now they've got the delivery systems and I have that from very high level sources
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:19.920]  But here is Benjamin Netanyahu live giving a breakdown from Tel Aviv, ladies and gentlemen, about the fact that they're getting ready to go after Iran
[01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:21.920]  Here it is
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:27.920]  This is repeated by Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:35.920]  We didn't have any program to develop nuclear weapons, anyway we consider nuclear weapons both irrational as well as immoral
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:41.920]  Well, tonight I'm here to tell you one thing, Iran lied
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:43.920]  Big time
[01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:52.920]  After signing the nuclear deal in 2015, Iran intensified its efforts to hide its secret nuclear files
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:22:01.920]  In 2017, Iran moved its nuclear weapons files to a highly secret location in Tehran
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:09.920]  This is the Shorabad district in southern Tehran, this is where they kept the atomic archives, right here
[01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:18.920]  Few Iranians knew where it was, very few, and also a few Israelis
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:26.920]  Now from the outside, this was an innocent looking compound, it looks like a dilapidated warehouse
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:35.920]  But from the inside, it contained Iran's secret atomic archives locked in massive files, actually they're a little bigger than this
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:47.920]  A few weeks ago, in a great intelligence achievement, Israel obtained half a ton of the material inside these vaults
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:50.920]  And here's what we got
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:23:05.920]  55,000 pages, another 55,000 files on 183 CDs
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:14.920]  Everything you're about to see is an exact copy of the original Iranian material
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:22.920]  You may want to know where are the originals, well I can say they're now in a very safe place
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:42.920]  Here's what the files included, incriminating documents, incriminating charts, incriminating presentations, incriminating blueprints, incriminating photos, incriminating videos, and more
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:50.920]  We've shared this material with the United States, and the United States can vouch for its authenticity
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:57.920]  We will also share it with other countries, and we'll share it with the International Atomic Energy Agency
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:00.920]  So let me tell you the history of this material
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:07.920]  We've known for years that Iran had a secret nuclear weapons program called Project Ahmad
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:17.920]  We can now prove that Project Ahmad was a comprehensive program to design, build, and test nuclear weapons
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:28.920]  We can also prove that Iran is secretly storing Project Ahmad material to use at a time of its choice to develop nuclear weapons
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:36.920]  Here's what Project Ahmad's explicit goal was, creating nuclear weapons
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:43.920]  This is an original Iranian presentation from these files, and here's the mission statement
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:54.920]  Design, produce, and test five warheads each with 10 kiloton TNT yield for integration on a missile
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:25:01.920]  You don't have to read Farsi to see 10 kilotons here, TNT
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:06.920]  This is the specific goal of Project Ahmad
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:13.920]  That's like five Hiroshima bombs to be put on ballistic missiles
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:21.920]  This is an original Iranian spreadsheet from the archives of Project Ahmad
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:32.920]  Look at what it has here, yellow cake production, centrifuge enrichment process, warhead project, simulation project, and test
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:46.920]  And indeed, when we analyzed what's in these archives, we found that Project Ahmad had all the five elements, the five key elements of a nuclear weapons program
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:49.920]  I want to take them one by one
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:53.920]  The first element is designing nuclear weapons
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:58.920]  This is an original Iranian illustration of a weapon
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:02.920]  Again, you don't have to read Farsi to understand this
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:07.920]  This is U-235, that's in rich uranium, right here at the core
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:12.920]  That's the only place where you find in the core, in rich uranium
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:19.920]  And here's an Iranian simulation, original Iranian simulation, putting all these components together
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:21.920]  That's the first component
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:25.920]  Second component, developing nuclear cores
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:33.920]  Here's a photo showing the casting process and the cast metal core from the archives
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:42.920]  And here's a secret underground facility, the Iranians were building to produce nuclear cores
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:46.920]  We have hundreds of documents for each of these components
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:50.920]  Third component, building nuclear implosion systems
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:55.920]  This is an original Iranian photo of a measuring device
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:00.920]  And here's a simulation of a nuclear implosion
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:06.920]  Fourth element, preparing nuclear tests
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:12.920]  Here's a map of five potential locations for a nuclear test in Eastern Iran
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:16.920]  One, two, three, four, five
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:19.920]  We have many more...
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:22.920]  He's still briefing but we can pause it obviously and come back
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:25.920]  This is very important, this has got sprung on the world
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:30.920]  And Netanyahu is giving a worldwide press conference and here's the deal, Iran said they weren't developing a nuclear weapon
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:36.920]  Then they did this deal, we all know they are, I've been told by high level sources a decade ago they already had some
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:41.920]  But they didn't have delivery systems, Pakistan obviously has over a hundred
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:45.920]  And the point is, is that Trump's trying to get peace through strength
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:51.920]  You've got Saudi Arabia and Israel now lined up and ready to support a strike on Iran
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:56.920]  And so that's the issue here, I don't want to have war with Iran
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:02.920]  But they're very aggressive to our ships, they're very aggressive, their people don't like the leadership
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:05.920]  Most of their population is young, the Mullahs are out of control
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:11.920]  And Israel will end up moving against that country if they think they get delivery systems
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:18.920]  And that's what Netanyahu undoubtedly will come back with, is the delivery systems after the testing phase on the other side
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:21.920]  But regardless of what you think of this, this is where the world is
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:28.920]  And appeasement got North Korea out of control firing missiles at Hawaii to test them
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:31.920]  Yet in their face got them to do a peace deal
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:35.920]  What is Netanyahu trying to do here, push Iran to the peace table?
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:42.920]  I hope that's the point, because one way or another the world is in a great crisis right now
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:50.920]  We'll be back more with this big briefing, I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, newswars.com
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:29:12.920]  Tomorrow's news today, stay with us

[01:29:50.920 --> 01:30:01.920]  I'm not a rocket scientist, but I know to go out and check the top side to see what they say
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:12.920]  And they have talked about for decades that a lot of the mental disorders, a lot of the behavioral disorders, a lot of the autism spectrum disorders are in the gut
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:22.920]  From the diets and vaccines that trigger autoimmune responses in the stomach, that then create major toxicity in the gut, causing toxicity in the brain
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:28.920]  Here's a big BBC report today, how bacteria are changing your mood, and if you have the wrong ones, you're depressed
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:31.920]  Well ladies and gentlemen, it's been sold out for months
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:41.920]  MycoZX is back, anti-fungal, anti-east, anti-Kandida, that goes in and knocks out the walls in your intestines, where these things colonize it and put a slime wall in
[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:49.920]  But the nutrients go through, they get what they want first, they colonize you, then they secrete toxins in you, they cause depression, they can even secrete toxins when they want more sugar
[01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:55.920]  This is well known, Nukem with MycoZX, exclusively at infowarslife.com
[01:30:55.920 --> 01:31:00.920]  I was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up, and I got some bad news
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:10.920]  For the second time in the five and a half year history of Survival Shield X2, our flagship product, we are having supply chain problems, and this may be the last batch of this
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:17.920]  We have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:29.920]  And so in our own search to get the purest form, we discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers that they used to make drugs
[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:33.920]  And once they figure out there's a market, they start jacking up the price
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:41.920]  But we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out, hopefully just like the last time this happened a few years ago, it's not an issue and we do get more
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:47.920]  But right now we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine in the world
[01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:52.920]  But what it does is for stamina, libido, focus, energy is really amazing
[01:31:52.920 --> 01:32:14.920]  Survival Shield X2 at InfowarsStore.com, InfowarsLife.com
[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:34.920]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:38.920]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:48.920]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body
[01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:56.920]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe, head to InfowarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets
[01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:15.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:29.920]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:35.920]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:54.920]  Well, as we speak, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who sits on top of giant hydrogen bomb nuke arsenal of cruise missiles, ICBMs, submarine launch, launch by aircraft, cruise missiles, you name it
[01:33:54.920 --> 01:34:05.920]  Is laying out shocking amounts of evidence of Iran's secret nuclear weapons program that they say they've given up for many years
[01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:16.920]  Now, he's showing right now documents from a decade ago, but he's pointing out that it's all hidden in underground bases and warehouses ready to roll out
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:23.920]  Now, I have talked years ago to very good sources who, let's just say I've been in the military 30 years, you name it, they said no
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:41.920]  They've seen the scans with the satellites and aircraft that can see down into the ground and that they have a lot of concentrated fissile material and the ability to build atomic bombs
[01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:45.920]  Atomic bombs are not that hard to build once you've got the material
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:49.920]  And of course, Pakistan's got hundreds, this is all very serious situation
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:56.920]  The larger issue here is, is Israel going to strike Iran? Well, they've got Saudi Arabia lined up to do it
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:01.920]  And Saudi Arabia has been hinting that they've got nuclear weapons now, which I've been told they've had for a decade
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:15.920]  They said, listen, if they're going to have it, we're going to have it, and the word is Israel's been transferring more advanced delivery systems now to Saudi Arabia
[01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:22.920]  So think about that, the Saudi Arabian Muslims, who are over 80% of Islam, they control it, they control Mecca
[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:30.920]  They reportedly have nuclear weapons, and so if you're a radio listener, it's Netanyahu and Tel Aviv, it's nighttime over there, it's like 8.30
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:43.920]  With huge weapons banks, huge banks of folders and CDs going through the evidence, this isn't like a little fake thing with WMDs
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:46.920]  And Colin Powell holds up a little vial of anthrax at the UN
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:55.920]  We knew that intelligence was fake, my intel has been Iran's got nukes, so I don't know what Israel's thinking, but I haven't seen the whole press conference yet, but it's still going on, but we paused it
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:36:02.920]  I'm going to guess he's going to get into delivery systems, that's why he's really concerned, because the truth is just like Israel doesn't say they have nukes
[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:11.920]  Iran's got them too, they're getting upset about the delivery systems, let's see if I'm right, let's go back to the press conference
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:18.920]  Here's a map of five potential locations for a nuclear test in Eastern Iran
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:26.920]  One, two, three, four, five, we have many, many more such documents
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:31.920]  And fifth, integrating nuclear weapons on missiles
[01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:40.920]  Here's a design for a nuclear payload on a Shahab 3 missile from the archive
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:46.920]  Here's the warhead, here's the bomb
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:54.920]  And I don't have to remind you, I think, that Iran is continually expanding the range of its ballistic missiles, it's nuclear capable missiles
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:37:05.920]  They started with a thousand kilometers, they're now up to two thousand, roughly, they can reach Riyadh, Tel Aviv, Moscow
[01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:16.920]  But they're working on far, far greater ranges, they're planning much longer range missiles to carry nuclear weapons
[01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:27.920]  So these files conclusively prove that Iran is brazenly lying when it says it never had a nuclear weapons program
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:36.920]  The files prove that, but here's what happened next
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:42.920]  Iran was faced with mounting pressure in 2003, you remember that, that was following the Gulf War
[01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:48.920]  So it was forced to shell Project Ahmad, but it didn't show its nuclear ambitions
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:56.920]  So Iran devised a plan to do two things, first to preserve the nuclear know-how from Project Ahmad
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:01.920]  And second, to further develop its nuclear weapons related capabilities
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:05.920]  That plan came directly from Iran's top leadership
[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:08.920]  Here's another document from the archive
[01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:13.920]  This is following the new directive of Iran's Ministry of Defense, Mr. Shamkhani
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:17.920]  Today is the director of the National Security Council
[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:27.920]  Following the new directive of Iran's Ministry of Defense, the work would be split into two parts, covert and overt
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:33.920]  A key part of the plan was to form new organizations to continue the work
[01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:40.920]  This is how Dr. Mohsen Fahizadeh, head of Project Ahmad put it, remember that name, Fahizadeh
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:42.920]  So here's his directive, it's right here
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:54.920]  And he says, the general aim is to announce the closure of Project Ahmad, but then he adds, special activities, you know what that is
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:39:00.920]  Special activities will be carried out under the title of Scientific Know-How Developments
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:07.920]  And in fact, this is exactly what Iran proceeded to do
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:12.920]  It continued this work in a series of organizations over the years
[01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:23.920]  And today in 2010, 2018, this work is carried out by SAPAN, that's an organization inside Iran's Defense Ministry
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:32.920]  And you will not be surprised to hear that SAPAN is led by the same person who led Project Ahmad, Dr. Fahizadeh
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:40.920]  And also, not coincidentally, many of SAPAN's key personnel worked under Fahizadeh on Project Ahmad
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:50.920]  So this atomic archive clearly shows that Iran planned, at the highest levels, to continue work related to nuclear weapons
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:55.920]  Under different guises, and using the same personnel
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:05.920]  I want to give you another example of Iran's nuclear weapons related activities that continued after Project Ahmad
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:10.920]  You all remember the Fordo facility? Can you show that?
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:13.920]  Fordo, an Iranian enrichment facility
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:19.920]  This was a secret underground enrichment facility that the Iranians built under a mountain
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:27.920]  You don't put thousands of centrifuges under a mountain to produce medical isotopes
[01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:31.920]  You put them there for one reason, nuclear weapons
[01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:34.920]  Enrichment for nuclear weapons
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:39.920]  But the files show that Fordo was designed from the get-go
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:42.920]  For nuclear weapons as part of Project Ahmad
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:47.920]  Here's an original Iranian blueprint of Fordo
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:55.920]  And what happened was that Iran continued to build Fordo years, secretly built it
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:57.920]  Years after Project Ahmad ended
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:01.920]  Okay, I was going to take calls this hour, and I wasn't going to get another news
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:04.920]  But this is obviously breaking, this is big, because here's the issue
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:11.920]  Whether you love Israel or hate Israel or are neutral on Israel, pragmatic on Israel like I am
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:15.920]  This is the build-up to major war you're watching
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:17.920]  The Saudi Prince over here
[01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:20.920]  The roundup of the jihadis that were leading Saudi Arabia
[01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:23.920]  The civil war in Saudi Arabia
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:27.920]  Now Saudi Arabia wanting us to kick Assad out, that's part of the deal
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:31.920]  That they'll denuclearize and they'll stop funding jihad
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:33.920]  If we knock out their enemies
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:35.920]  Now of course it's going to be a double cross
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:39.920]  Because the globalist, the globalist ladies and gentlemen
[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:43.920]  They are fomenting all over the world
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:46.920]  In every way they can
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:48.920]  At every point
[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:52.920]  And every civilization that puts up with this ends up falling
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:54.920]  The globalist are fomenting
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:42:00.920]  A operation to overrun Europe and collapse it and implode it
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:03.920]  And to basically end Christianity as we know it
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:07.920]  So there's double dealing from the very tops of the whole global government system
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:13.920]  Down into Saudi Arabia and into Israel and into all these different organizations and groups
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:15.920]  To create the class of civilization
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:18.920]  To overthrow non-radical Muslim countries
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:20.920]  And then to break down Europe's borders
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:21.920]  Merge Islam with the West
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:23.920]  Bring in a huge clash of culture
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:26.920]  And then bring in a worldwide peacekeeper government
[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:29.920]  To stop the cultural and financial ruin
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:34.920]  That this forced integration of Islam into the West is going to cause
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:36.920]  So that's the thing, I'm not anti-Israel
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:40.920]  But at the same time this whole clash with Iran
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:43.920]  Is simply about a war between the Shiites and the Sunnis
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:46.920]  A civil war to knock out the world
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:50.920]  So that then the main Islamic force can march against Europe and Russia
[01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:56.920]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with knockout by Info War's life

[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:23.920]  Then they start producing reactive oxygen species
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:28.920]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:31.920]  Resulting from these reactive oxygen species
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:36.920]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:38.920]  The stronger the antioxidant
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:42.920]  The better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species

[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:12.920]  A new tropic
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:13.920]  It doesn't have any stimulants in it
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:15.920]  But boy does it stimulate
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:17.920]  Because it's beyond that
[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:19.920]  Quite frankly
[01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:23.920]  I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:25.920]  But it wasn't prescription
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:27.920]  But they were charging people $100-200
[01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:29.920]  For the formulae
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:31.920]  And I came up with our own formula
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:33.920]  Working with some scientists and developers
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:35.920]  Non-GMO
[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:37.920]  Made right here in America
[01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:39.920]  120 capsules
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:41.920]  You add the preglinone to it
[01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:43.920]  Which is the precursor
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:45.920]  To all the hormones that your body has to have
[01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:47.920]  To even make the hormones in your glands
[01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:49.920]  It is amazing
[01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:51.920]  Red pill
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:53.920]  Now available at infowarsstore.com

[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:20.920]  You're listening to Alex Jones
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:22.920]  Listen, baby
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:25.920]  We're about to go to the in-depth historic briefing
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:27.920]  With real secret documents
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:29.920]  Real secret graphics videos
[01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:31.920]  For atomic weapons
[01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:33.920]  Which I've studied
[01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:35.920]  These are real
[01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:37.920]  I ran
[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:39.920]  I know they had a program
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:41.920]  They didn't deny the program
[01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:43.920]  They're ongoing
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:45.920]  I've talked to the folks that have seen
[01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:47.920]  The satellite scans
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:49.920]  They had five weapons
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:51.920]  As you see in this report, man, I was told
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:53.920]  Stuffed by folks ten years ago that was dead on
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:55.920]  Five weapons a decade ago
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:57.920]  And they're going for delivery systems
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:47:59.920]  And forget which side you're on
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:01.920]  I'm on the side of not having nuclear war
[01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:03.920]  I'm on the side of peace
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:05.920]  For young people in Iran
[01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:07.920]  Young people in Israel
[01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:09.920]  Young people in Russia
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:11.920]  Young people in Germany
[01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:13.920]  Young people in Brazil
[01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:15.920]  Young people in Canada
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:17.920]  Young people in America
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:18.920]  They are the Shiite Muslims
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:20.920]  Nineteen percent of Islam
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:22.920]  They're at war with Sunni Islam
[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:24.920]  Saudi Arabia
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:26.920]  The two are each other's throats
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:28.920]  Between Hezbollah and Hamas
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:30.920]  And their proxy wars
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:32.920]  It's all out of control
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:34.920]  But the globalist are allied with Saudi Arabia
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:36.920]  And after they take out Iran
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:38.920]  They're going to implode the borders
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:40.920]  Of Europe and flood Europe even more
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:42.920]  I'm not saying I'm on any of these sides
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:44.920]  Because this is all insane
[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:46.920]  But here's the bottom line
[01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:48.920]  Netanyahu is preparing and selling
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:50.920]  A strike on Iran
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:52.920]  And that's why they've been in all these secret meetings
[01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:55.920]  With the crown prince of Saudi Arabia
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:48:57.920]  That's why he's been on this goodwill tour over here
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:00.920]  That's why you've seen the push to strike Syria
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:02.920]  That's why the Russians announced
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:04.920]  A month and a half ago
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:06.920]  We're getting a hundred percent out
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:08.920]  We went in, we stabilized it, boom
[01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:10.920]  That's why North Korea
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:12.920]  Is saying, okay, we want a peace deal
[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:13.920]  Because the word is
[01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:15.920]  The United States, Israel and others
[01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:18.920]  Are getting ready to strike Iran
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:20.920]  And Iran's been saying
[01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:22.920]  We'll blow up your ships, we'll attack you
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:24.920]  If you don't give us a peace deal
[01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:26.920]  If you back out of your agreement with us
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:28.920]  That is not helping
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:30.920]  Because this isn't the old days with Obama
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:32.920]  Who's a little jihadi
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:34.920]  And who's working with Saudi Arabia
[01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:36.920]  This is Trump
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:38.920]  And Trump's very pragmatic
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:40.920]  He wants all these wars to stop
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:41.920]  And here's the deal
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:44.920]  Israel's been caught working with Al Qaeda and ISIS
[01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:46.920]  Just like our government did under Obama
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:48.920]  Netanyahu knows that
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:50.920]  I'm not attacking Netanyahu
[01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:52.920]  It's a fact
[01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:54.920]  Because that was the enemy of Hezbollah
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:49:56.920]  Which is the Iranian-backed militia
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:49:58.920]  That's the way these wars work
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:00.920]  We shouldn't be Machiavelli
[01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:02.920]  We shouldn't back anybody that's evil
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:04.920]  Even if they're fighting somebody else, it's bad
[01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:06.920]  That's Arabic thinking
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:08.920]  Muslim thinking of the enemy and my enemy
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:09.920]  And my friend
[01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:11.920]  No, no, that's not chivalrous
[01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:13.920]  That's not what made the West powerful
[01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:15.920]  We need to get away from that
[01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:18.920]  But Iran has been threatening to blow up Israel
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:20.920]  And Iran does have the missiles that hit Israel
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:22.920]  And they've already got nukes
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:24.920]  So this is preparation for attacks on Iran
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:26.920]  Maybe they're trying to push it to the table
[01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:28.920]  The old deal is a bad deal
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:30.920]  They did lie
[01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:32.920]  I'm not calling for war
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:34.920]  But Netanyahu, I know the whole history of this
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:36.920]  This isn't fake WMDs in Iraq
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:37.920]  This is real
[01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:39.920]  This is real
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:41.920]  Iraq was horrible and evil
[01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:43.920]  He was our ally
[01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:45.920]  He fought the Iranians
[01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:47.920]  Killed a couple million of them
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:49.920]  We set Saddam up
[01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:51.920]  It's horrible
[01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:53.920]  And again, part of a program of destabilization
[01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:55.920]  Now we're sitting there down to the final program
[01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:57.920]  That Wesley Clark talked about
[01:50:58.920 --> 01:50:59.920]  When he laid out the seven countries they wanted to take out
[01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:01.920]  But next they're going to implode them into Europe
[01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:03.920]  That's the next part of the plan
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:05.920]  Now I don't know if Netanyahu supports that plan
[01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:07.920]  But I know the EU and the Vatican does
[01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:09.920]  I know Trump does it for real
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:11.920]  So if Netanyahu comes out and says he doesn't support
[01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:13.920]  The Islamification of Europe
[01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:15.920]  I'll be pro Netanyahu
[01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:18.920]  I don't think Netanyahu wants to do that to Europe
[01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:21.920]  Now some of the leftist in Israel
[01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:23.920]  George Soros that came out in the WikiLeaks
[01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:25.920]  Wants to destroy Israel
[01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:30.920]  So this is all about pure evil
[01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:32.920]  And the globalists have made a deal with radical Islam
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:36.920]  And they think Saudi Arabia controlling 80% of Islam
[01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:39.920]  That's going to be 2.5 billion people in just 12 years
[01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:41.920]  3 billion total
[01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:43.920]  They think that's unstoppable
[01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:45.920]  I'm not submitting to Islam
[01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:47.920]  I'm going to fight
[01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:49.920]  What about you?
[01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:51.920]  And I don't care if it's Israel
[01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:53.920]  I don't care if it's the Pope
[01:51:54.920 --> 01:51:55.920]  I don't care if it's Trump, whoever it is
[01:51:56.920 --> 01:51:57.920]  They sell us out to radical Islam
[01:51:57.920 --> 01:51:59.920]  They're going to stand against them
[01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:01.920]  This is a do or die situation
[01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:03.920]  So I'm trying to figure out all the angles here
[01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:05.920]  But let me tell you this
[01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:07.920]  This is preparation for major war right here baby
[01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:09.920]  So you get ready
[01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:11.920]  Let's go to the footage
[01:52:12.920 --> 01:52:13.920]  Was that Iran continued to build Fordot
[01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:15.920]  Years, secretly built it
[01:52:16.920 --> 01:52:17.920]  Years after project Ahmad ended
[01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:19.920]  Here's what it looks like
[01:52:20.920 --> 01:52:21.920]  That's the entrance
[01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:23.920]  It goes under a mountain
[01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:27.920]  You also will not be surprised that Iran insisted on keeping Fordot
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:29.920]  And then basically
[01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:32.920]  The nuclear deal enabled it to do it
[01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:34.920]  It enabled it to do it
[01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:37.920]  But this came with a hitch
[01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:41.920]  Iran was required by the IAA
[01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:44.920]  To come clean by the nuclear deal
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:46.920]  To come clean to the
[01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:48.920]  International Atomic Energy Agency
[01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:50.920]  About its nuclear program
[01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:52.920]  This was an explicit condition
[01:52:53.920 --> 01:52:55.920]  For implementing the nuclear deal
[01:52:56.920 --> 01:52:57.920]  Iran has to come clean
[01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:00.920]  So in December 2015
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:04.920]  The IAA published its final assessment
[01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:07.920]  Of what it called the military aspects
[01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:09.920]  Of Iran's nuclear program
[01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:11.920]  This is the report
[01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:13.920]  This was Iran's chance
[01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:16.920]  To fully come clean to the IAA
[01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:18.920]  They could tell the truth
[01:53:18.920 --> 01:53:19.920]  They could say we had this program
[01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:21.920]  The secret program
[01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:22.920]  It's over, we shelved it
[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:24.920]  It doesn't exist
[01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:25.920]  We destroyed the material
[01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:29.920]  Here's what Iran actually told the IAA
[01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:31.920]  It said
[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:36.920]  Iran denied the existence of a coordinated program
[01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:39.920]  Aimed at the development of a nuclear explosive device
[01:53:40.920 --> 01:53:41.920]  And specifically denied
[01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:44.920]  That this specifically denied
[01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:47.920]  The existence of the AMAD plan
[01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:51.920]  The material proves otherwise
[01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:55.920]  That Iran authorized, initiated, and funded Project AMAD
[01:53:56.920 --> 01:53:57.920]  A coordinated program
[01:53:58.920 --> 01:54:00.920]  Aimed at the development of a nuclear explosive device
[01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:02.920]  Here's another document
[01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:04.920]  From the archive
[01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:06.920]  This is a master plan
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:08.920]  Of Project AMAD
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:10.920]  Iran said to the IAA
[01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:15.920]  No work has been conducted with multi-point initiative
[01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:18.920]  This is multi-point initiative
[01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:20.920]  You've got to forgive me
[01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:22.920]  This jargon, this scientific terminology
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:24.920]  Is something that is necessary to understand
[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:26.920]  The production of nuclear weapons
[01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:28.920]  But here's what they say
[01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:30.920]  No work has been conducted
[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:32.920]  With MPI technology
[01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:34.920]  In hemispherical geometry
[01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:36.920]  But again the archive shows
[01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:38.920]  That this is a complete fabrication
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:39.920]  Iran conducted extensive work
[01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:41.920]  With MPI technology
[01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:43.920]  In hemispherical geometry
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:45.920]  Here's an example
[01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:47.920]  Jacketed explosives
[01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:49.920]  That crushed it down
[01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:51.920]  That caused a chain reaction
[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:53.920]  To the agency
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:55.920]  That it had not conducted metallurgical work
[01:54:56.920 --> 01:54:57.920]  Specifically designed for a nuclear device
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:00.920]  But the files again show
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:02.920]  That this is a lie
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:04.920]  Iran conducted extensive metallurgical work
[01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:06.920]  Specifically designed for a nuclear device
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:07.920]  Here's an original Iranian photo
[01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:10.920]  Plenty more in the archive
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:12.920]  So what I've shown you tonight
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:16.920]  Is just a fraction of the total material
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:18.920]  That we have
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:20.920]  But even from this sample
[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:24.920]  You can draw four main conclusions
[01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:30.920]  First, Iran lied about never having a nuclear weapons program
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:34.920]  100,000 secret files proved that they lied
[01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:37.920]  Second, even after the deal
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:40.920]  Iran continued to preserve and expand
[01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:42.920]  Its nuclear weapons know-how
[01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:44.920]  For future use
[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:46.920]  Why would a terrorist regime
[01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:50.920]  Hide and meticulously seek catalog
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:52.920]  Its secret nuclear files
[01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:54.920]  If not to use them at a later date
[01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:58.920]  Third, Iran lied again
[01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:00.920]  Iran lied again in 2015
[01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:03.920]  When it didn't come clean to the IAA
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:05.920]  As required by the nuclear deal
[01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:07.920]  And finally
[01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:11.920]  The Iran deal
[01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:13.920]  The nuclear deal
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:15.920]  Is based on lies
[01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:17.920]  It's based on Iranian lies
[01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:19.920]  In Iranian deception
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:21.920]  All right
[01:56:22.920 --> 01:56:23.920]  We're going to come back to five more minutes
[01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:25.920]  We have a special guest joining us
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:27.920]  But the head of our European Bureau
[01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:29.920]  Is going to be joining us with some big, huge breaking news
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:31.920]  On globalism there
[01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:33.920]  But this is all part of a larger global plan
[01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:35.920]  To take control of the Middle East
[01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:37.920]  Then use it as a weapon system to bring down
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:41.920]  Asia, Russia, Europe
[01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:43.920]  It's been decided demographically
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:45.920]  Just like China has been decided to be in control
[01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:47.920]  Of a system
[01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:49.920]  It's been decided
[01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:51.920]  Trump's also giving a press conference right now
[01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:53.920]  We'll come back with all of that here in just a minute
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:54.920]  But briefly
[01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:56.920]  We're under globalist attacks
[01:56:57.920 --> 01:56:58.920]  We're telling the truth
[01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:00.920]  And just telling it like it is
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:02.920]  So you can make decisions about your own life
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:04.920]  We sell great products at infowarstore.com
[01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:06.920]  That without you buying them we won't be here
[01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:08.920]  The globalists hate the fact that you're buying our products
[01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:10.920]  We have back in stock
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:12.920]  Our amazing ultimate turmeric formula

[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:25.920]  It won't be 25% off when we get it back in
[01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:27.920]  Because it's running out
[01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:29.920]  We're hoping to get another source
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:31.920]  Supermold Vitality

[01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:51.920]  Go ahead
[01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:53.920]  Alex, you can rent any day of the week
[01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:55.920]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do
[01:57:56.920 --> 01:57:57.920]  And being a patriot
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:57:59.920]  And doing your best to save America
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:01.920]  And encouraging us as fellow patriots
[01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:03.920]  To do that in our local areas as well
[01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:05.920]  And as a long-time infowars listener
[01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:07.920]  I want to say thanks
[01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:09.920]  For the awesome brain force
[01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:11.920]  Anthroplex
[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:13.920]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks
[01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:15.920]  For the Anthroplex, too
[01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:16.920]  For the big, normal toothpaste fans
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:18.920]  The super blue is awesome
[01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:20.920]  And thank you so much, Alex
[01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:22.920]  For the infowars life products
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:24.920]  They are quality
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:26.920]  I can't wait to get some more
[01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:28.920]  And thank you so much for doing that
[01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:30.920]  For us to keep us healthy
[01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:32.920]  Absolutely
[01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:34.920]  Because then we could all as educated patriots
[01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:36.920]  Help our other countrymen and women
[01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:38.920]  Understand that there's a bigger problems going on
[01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:40.920]  And if we can get our houses in order
[01:58:41.920 --> 01:58:42.920]  And be good to each other and ourselves
[01:58:42.920 --> 01:58:44.920]  And be good to each other
[01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:13.920]  Deep Earth iodine crystals
[01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:15.920]  This essential mineral is necessary
[01:59:16.920 --> 01:59:17.920]  In order to produce thyroid hormones
[01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:19.920]  Which influence every cell, tissue
[01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:21.920]  And organ in the body
[01:59:22.920 --> 01:59:23.920]  With inadequate thyroid hormones
[01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:25.920]  You may experience slow metabolism
[01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:27.920]  Lethargy
[01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:29.920]  Weight gain
[01:59:30.920 --> 01:59:31.920]  And overall brain fog
[01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:33.920]  Survival Shield X2
[01:59:34.920 --> 01:59:35.920]  And Biotrue Selenium work together
[01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:37.920]  To support the systems in your body
[01:59:38.920 --> 01:59:39.920]  Take control of your chemistry today
[01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:41.920]  Discover the power of Survival Shield X2
[01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:43.920]  And Biotrue Selenium

[01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:52.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:07.920]  You're listening to
[02:00:07.920 --> 02:00:08.920]  The Alex Jones show
[02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:33.920]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen
[02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:35.920]  Trump is speaking at a press conference
[02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:36.920]  With a Nigerian president
[02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:39.920]  He hasn't gotten into the caravan yet
[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:41.920]  But he's set to speak on that
[02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:43.920]  We'll go to that in the next segment
[02:00:44.920 --> 02:00:45.920]  And we have a guest joining us
[02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:47.920]  That deals with the very same deal
[02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:49.920]  The globalist plan to use open borders
[02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:51.920]  As a weapon to bring in their master plan
[02:00:52.920 --> 02:00:53.920]  We'll detail it all with Dan Lyman
[02:00:54.920 --> 02:00:55.920]  And the amazing work he does
[02:00:56.920 --> 02:00:57.920]  As the head of the new info wars
[02:00:58.920 --> 02:00:59.920]  Euro desk and info wars Europe
[02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:01.920]  Now launch the new sites
[02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:03.920]  Be sure and check that out
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:04.920]  Matt and Yahoo who spoke earlier
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:06.920]  Had a press conference
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:08.920]  That aired at about 8 o'clock
[02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:10.920]  Televieve time
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:12.920]  And what he's saying is true about Iran
[02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:15.920]  I don't want to have war with Iran
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:18.920]  The point is the west is going
[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:20.920]  Towards war with Iran
[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:22.920]  And Iran isn't making that any better
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:24.920]  With their belligerent pro-war statements
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:26.920]  And talking about their missiles
[02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:28.920]  And all the rest of it
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:30.920]  So the conclusion is the US Saudi Arabia
[02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:32.920]  And I think Iran, I don't want that to happen
[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:34.920]  Notice Netanyahu talked about how
[02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:36.920]  One of their new missiles can hit Moscow
[02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:39.920]  He's trying to get the Russians on board with this
[02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:43.920]  Why did they invent nuclear weapons
[02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:45.920]  Well the Pope says ban them all
[02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:47.920]  Ban all weapons of course
[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:49.920]  Except the weapons the UN will have
[02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:51.920]  We know what that means
[02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:53.920]  So I just pray humanity can survive
[02:01:54.920 --> 02:01:55.920]  Here's the conclusion of what the
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:01:59.920]  United States has concluded saying
[02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:02.920]  No work has been conducted with
[02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:04.920]  Multi-point initiative
[02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:06.920]  This is multi-point initiative
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:08.920]  You've got to forgive me
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:10.920]  This jargon, this scientific terminology
[02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:12.920]  Is something that is necessary to understand
[02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:14.920]  The production of nuclear weapons
[02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:16.920]  But here's what they say
[02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:18.920]  No work has been conducted with
[02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:20.920]  MPI technology
[02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:22.920]  In hemispherical geometry
[02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:24.920]  Here's an example, hundreds of more documents prove it
[02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:27.920]  Iran said to the agency
[02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:29.920]  That it had not conducted
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:31.920]  Metalogical work specifically designed
[02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:33.920]  For a nuclear device
[02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:35.920]  But the files again show
[02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:37.920]  That this is a lie
[02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:39.920]  Iran conducted extensive
[02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:41.920]  Metalogical work specifically designed
[02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:43.920]  For a nuclear device
[02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:46.920]  But the files again show
[02:02:47.920 --> 02:02:48.920]  That this is a lie
[02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:50.920]  Iran conducted extensive
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:55.880]  metallurgical work, specifically designed for a nuclear device. Here's an original Iranian
[02:02:55.880 --> 02:03:04.880]  photo, plenty more in the archive. So what I've shown you tonight is just a fraction
[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:14.520]  of the total material that we have. But even from this sample, you can draw four main conclusions.
[02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:23.760]  First, Iran lied about never having a nuclear weapons program. 100,000 secret files prove
[02:03:23.760 --> 02:03:30.760]  that they lied. Second, even after the deal, Iran continued to preserve and expand its
[02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:39.560]  nuclear weapons novel for future use. Why would a terrorist regime hide and meticulously
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:48.160]  see catalog its secret nuclear files if not to use them at a later date? Third, Iran lied
[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:56.080]  again in 2015 when it didn't come clean to the IAEA as required by the nuclear deal.
[02:03:56.080 --> 02:04:07.560]  And finally, the Iran deal, the nuclear deal, is based on lies. It's based on Iranian lies
[02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:19.480]  and Iranian deception. 100,000 files right here prove that they lied. So here's the
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:31.200]  bottom line. Iran continues to lie. Just last week, Zarif said this, we never wanted to
[02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:38.680]  produce a bomb. Again? We never wanted to produce a bomb. Yes, you did. Yes, you do.
[02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:46.280]  And the atomic archive proves it. The nuclear deal gives Iran a clear path to an atomic
[02:04:46.280 --> 02:05:02.220]  explosion.

[02:06:19.900 --> 02:06:23.700]  European Bureau and doing a great job already covered day both for us of any
[02:06:23.700 --> 02:06:27.380]  other big events he's getting a team together he is just churning out amazing
[02:06:27.380 --> 02:06:32.540]  articles we're gonna get a simpler URL for it right now it's Europe dot info
[02:06:32.540 --> 02:06:40.100]  wars dot com and that is the new slick European design info wars we're gonna
[02:06:40.100 --> 02:06:44.060]  launch a London info wars we're gonna launch a New York and LA we're gonna
[02:06:44.060 --> 02:06:48.340]  launch it all and we're spending all our capital that's come in to do that we're
[02:06:48.340 --> 02:06:51.660]  expanding in the face the globalists they're really upset about it but thank
[02:06:51.660 --> 02:06:56.820]  you all for your support before we go to Dan Lyman in the next segment I want to
[02:06:56.820 --> 02:07:02.220]  just finish up with Benjamin Yahu from earlier do I agree with attacking Iran I
[02:07:02.220 --> 02:07:06.460]  don't want to is nothing yahu told us with about Iran's nuclear weapons program
[02:07:06.460 --> 02:07:12.540]  yes it's well known this is not like WMD's and Iraq and we know the power
[02:07:12.540 --> 02:07:17.940]  players so I'm gonna finish up with Netanyahu then give you my detailed
[02:07:17.940 --> 02:07:22.420]  analysis of this and what I think we ought to do straight ahead but let's
[02:07:22.420 --> 02:07:29.020]  finish up with the Prime Minister of Israel do some bomb again we never
[02:07:29.020 --> 02:07:34.580]  wanted to produce a bomb yes you did yes you do and the atomic archive proves
[02:07:34.580 --> 02:07:42.820]  it the nuclear deal gives Iran a clear path to an atomic arsenal it does so
[02:07:42.820 --> 02:07:46.180]  because it gives in the three components that are necessary to produce this
[02:07:46.180 --> 02:07:51.340]  arsenal first unlimited enrichment in a few years and they plan to do that they
[02:07:51.340 --> 02:07:54.940]  plan to have several hundred thousand advanced centrifuges with which they can
[02:07:54.940 --> 02:07:59.860]  reach mountains of uranium for that core that I showed you before for many many
[02:07:59.860 --> 02:08:05.020]  such cores second it completely fails to address Iran's development of
[02:08:05.020 --> 02:08:11.260]  continuing development of ballistic missiles and third and this is new it
[02:08:11.260 --> 02:08:15.820]  completely fails to address Iran's secret nuclear bomb program in its
[02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:25.220]  advanced work on weaponization we just did so this is a terrible deal it should
[02:08:25.220 --> 02:08:33.420]  never have been concluded and in a few days time president Trump will decide
[02:08:33.420 --> 02:08:38.900]  will make his decision on what to do with the nuclear deal I'm sure he'll do
[02:08:38.900 --> 02:08:44.780]  the right thing the right thing for the United States the right thing for Israel
[02:08:44.780 --> 02:09:11.900]  and the right thing for the peace of the world okay so now he's going into I
[02:09:11.900 --> 02:09:17.340]  guess Hebrew I guess I'll also probably address them in Farsi next so there you
[02:09:17.340 --> 02:09:24.100]  go ladies and gentlemen all hell about to break loose unless Iran backs down
[02:09:24.100 --> 02:09:30.820]  that's what's going to happen the decision has been made by Trump to not
[02:09:30.820 --> 02:09:36.260]  continue the strategy of tension with North Korea or Iran and that if they
[02:09:36.260 --> 02:09:42.140]  don't come to the table they're going to be destroyed and if I have to guess from
[02:09:42.140 --> 02:09:45.580]  what I've seen behind the scenes Russia is going to stand down and stay out of
[02:09:45.580 --> 02:09:49.900]  it China is going to stay out of it and that's why you see North Korea rolling
[02:09:49.900 --> 02:09:53.260]  over some are spending this like oh he's just getting another deal like he got
[02:09:53.260 --> 02:10:00.580]  with Clinton no Clinton gave them fizzle material and reactors they wanted to use
[02:10:00.580 --> 02:10:04.340]  North Korea's destabilizing force in the area Trump's pragmatic he wants to merge
[02:10:04.340 --> 02:10:09.540]  it down the road with South Korea and build it up does that mean I agree with
[02:10:09.540 --> 02:10:15.260]  Trump's strategy I wish there weren't nuclear weapons proliferating I wish that
[02:10:15.260 --> 02:10:20.460]  all of this wasn't going on at the same time document cam shot please you can't
[02:10:20.460 --> 02:10:23.780]  sit there with the Pope saying the whole world should just give up its weapons
[02:10:23.780 --> 02:10:28.900]  because that's not what's going to happen but then when Trump and others try to
[02:10:28.900 --> 02:10:34.740]  stop the nuclearization of the peninsula or the Middle East well they're bad
[02:10:34.740 --> 02:10:40.940]  guys here's the deal this is part of a long seven country strategy to bring
[02:10:40.940 --> 02:10:47.980]  down the Middle East Trump's being told as part of some new strategy anyway you
[02:10:47.980 --> 02:10:54.780]  slice it it's going to blow up and so is Iran a threat yes do they have weapons
[02:10:54.780 --> 02:10:59.300]  yes but did they see Gaddafi for eight years coming out of the cold invest his
[02:10:59.300 --> 02:11:06.180]  money with the West try to be our friends and then get set up and the
[02:11:06.180 --> 02:11:15.260]  answer is that is exactly what he saw so Iran has seen that North Korea has seen
[02:11:15.260 --> 02:11:18.780]  that and that's why North Korea came over the weekend and said okay we'll give
[02:11:18.780 --> 02:11:23.620]  up our nukes absolutely up front you have to sign a deal not to attack us or
[02:11:23.620 --> 02:11:27.060]  not to invade us as soon as we give them up
[02:11:29.740 --> 02:11:33.740]  by the way it's not that big a deal when you've got the number of ICBMs and a
[02:11:33.740 --> 02:11:39.060]  few nukes like North Korea has this will be taken out very quickly since the late
[02:11:39.060 --> 02:11:45.700]  70s the US has an orbit platforms with DU Shabo rounds that are let's say we a
[02:11:45.700 --> 02:11:49.660]  couple hundred pounds down even smaller sizes for killing satellites or killing
[02:11:49.660 --> 02:11:53.140]  individuals they could fire something the size of a 38 round that's you that's
[02:11:53.140 --> 02:11:56.940]  DU and it'll be nothing but a crater where your car is it's not an atomic
[02:11:56.940 --> 02:11:59.860]  weapon it's not a hydrogen weapon it's not a nuclear weapon it's a kinetic
[02:11:59.860 --> 02:12:05.580]  weapon it's a meteor gun now that was accidentally declassified in the mid 90s
[02:12:05.580 --> 02:12:09.780]  on c-span in a debate between the former head of the Star Wars program and a
[02:12:09.780 --> 02:12:14.820]  later head and they accidentally declassified that is the only reason we
[02:12:14.820 --> 02:12:21.740]  even know that but that's what we had in the 70s so Iran and North Korea this is
[02:12:21.740 --> 02:12:29.020]  really all about a message to China and Russia but I don't want an American
[02:12:29.020 --> 02:12:33.940]  Empire and I don't want to take out Iran and take out Hezbollah and then
[02:12:33.940 --> 02:12:37.500]  complete the global of Saudi Arabian plan to fully implode the border with
[02:12:37.500 --> 02:12:41.260]  Europe and Russia and then flood us for the Islamic takeover so as much as I
[02:12:41.260 --> 02:12:45.500]  don't like Iran and what they're doing this is all part of a larger strategy
[02:12:45.500 --> 02:12:49.140]  Trump just sees it as belligerent Iran can't have nukes can't threaten Israel
[02:12:49.140 --> 02:12:54.580]  guaranteed but see larger plan they want Europe in the US open Islam which
[02:12:54.580 --> 02:12:58.860]  Trump does oppose and is actually blocking so it's a very sophisticated
[02:12:58.860 --> 02:13:04.940]  strategy that Trump's involved in but also pragmatic at one level but it
[02:13:04.940 --> 02:13:11.700]  doesn't take into account larger globalist plans that this could play into
[02:13:11.700 --> 02:13:18.180]  so it's a very sophisticated we'll get Dan Lyman a great brain himself his
[02:13:18.180 --> 02:13:22.580]  take on this on the other side then we'll get into South Korea's president
[02:13:22.580 --> 02:13:25.780]  calls for Trump to get the Nobel Peace Prize for his work with North Korea and
[02:13:25.780 --> 02:13:30.340]  helping bring that war basically to an end already we've also got an amazing
[02:13:30.340 --> 02:13:36.980]  report from mr. Lyman that's up on info wars calm and now at Europe Wars calm

[02:19:51.780 --> 02:19:57.180]  it's time to change our bodies with ZShield InfoWarsLive.com
[02:19:57.180 --> 02:20:23.980]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:20:23.980 --> 02:20:29.620]  we now take you live to the central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the
[02:20:29.620 --> 02:20:36.100]  resistance it's Alex Jones it has been said that there are times in history
[02:20:36.100 --> 02:20:39.500]  when more happens in just a few years that happened in a previous decade or
[02:20:39.500 --> 02:20:46.100]  more now you see Trump on the cusp of legendary peace deal ending the 60 plus
[02:20:46.100 --> 02:20:51.180]  year ongoing war just been Armistice or ceasefire on the Korean Peninsula the
[02:20:51.180 --> 02:20:55.780]  Korean elected president and not the dictator of the North calling for Trump
[02:20:55.780 --> 02:20:59.860]  to get a peace prize you got the Pope calling for all weapons to be destroyed
[02:20:59.860 --> 02:21:03.700]  but he doesn't mean the UN or his own personal guards now he wants us to lower
[02:21:03.700 --> 02:21:09.140]  his guard he's a globalist just like he has walls but you can't have walls we've
[02:21:09.140 --> 02:21:12.420]  got all that to break down but I wanted to get Dan Lyman on because we've
[02:21:12.420 --> 02:21:18.460]  watched EuropeWars.com or just Europe.InfoWars.com our European office
[02:21:18.460 --> 02:21:21.660]  he's already got a few crew members of there started to follow hundreds of
[02:21:21.660 --> 02:21:25.060]  great reports going out and covered debuts you name it not a sterling job
[02:21:25.060 --> 02:21:29.180]  well there is so much going on because Europe is where the globalist are
[02:21:29.180 --> 02:21:33.980]  destroying the borders it's where they flooded in more than 10,000 Muslims just
[02:21:33.980 --> 02:21:38.380]  the last five years it is the admitted UN program to get rid of the borders and
[02:21:38.380 --> 02:21:44.300]  so whereas I want to stand up to Iran I want to stand up to Hezbollah you've
[02:21:44.300 --> 02:21:48.860]  got Saudi Arabia though who's even worse and they're wanting us to take out a
[02:21:48.860 --> 02:21:54.260]  sod who didn't do anything and they're pressuring for a attack on Iran who we
[02:21:54.260 --> 02:21:58.340]  do knows been developing nuclear weapons and that was a fraudulent deal they
[02:21:58.340 --> 02:22:04.500]  signed Netanyahu was right about that but at the same time if we take
[02:22:04.500 --> 02:22:08.620]  down all those buffer countries those Muslim countries that aren't under
[02:22:08.620 --> 02:22:13.540]  Saudi Arabian control that are Shiite or who are Alawite or who are
[02:22:13.540 --> 02:22:20.220]  Bathurst then we have the hegemonic control of Saudi Arabia who is financing
[02:22:20.220 --> 02:22:24.300]  the Islamification of Europe and how that ties into everything Dan Lyman has
[02:22:24.300 --> 02:22:27.860]  been breaking down in the incredible news that all over Europe they're
[02:22:27.860 --> 02:22:31.900]  appointing as mayors and police chiefs and heads of security and heads of
[02:22:31.900 --> 02:22:37.540]  border control Islamists who aren't even from those countries UK's immigration
[02:22:37.540 --> 02:22:43.140]  chief has Pakistan Muslim so Dan Lyman joins us from Europe thank you for
[02:22:43.140 --> 02:22:47.340]  joining us Dan pleasure to be back with you Alex how are you doing good you've
[02:22:47.340 --> 02:22:51.660]  heard my whole layout here this all ties together I mean as you know what is
[02:22:51.660 --> 02:22:55.620]  your geopolitical view on this absolutely never a dull moment there's
[02:22:55.620 --> 02:22:59.300]  always something going on on every front and it seems like as you said the
[02:22:59.300 --> 02:23:03.460]  the quickening is definitely happening there's more news every day everywhere
[02:23:03.460 --> 02:23:07.340]  around the world and Europe there's always something going on here so it's
[02:23:07.340 --> 02:23:10.060]  just it's amazing trying to keep you know your head around the whole thing it
[02:23:10.060 --> 02:23:18.060]  just keeps you spinning front and center though looking at that paradigm of what
[02:23:18.060 --> 02:23:21.980]  the globalist want versus what nation states want Eastern Europe standing up
[02:23:21.980 --> 02:23:25.140]  as champions against Islamic invasion because they've been invaded over a
[02:23:25.140 --> 02:23:28.420]  hundred times you've been going to Eastern Europe you've been covering this
[02:23:28.420 --> 02:23:34.820]  well talk about their awakening and where you see that leading to absolutely
[02:23:34.820 --> 02:23:38.780]  I spent a lot of time around the bulk of Europe at this point in the last few
[02:23:38.780 --> 02:23:42.820]  years and there's definitely a divide between Eastern and Western Europe as
[02:23:42.820 --> 02:23:46.420]  I've mentioned in the past on the show here when you go to Western European
[02:23:46.420 --> 02:23:50.820]  countries and their cities that were once magnificent places such as London
[02:23:50.820 --> 02:23:54.220]  and Paris these places are decaying they're rotting there are still nice
[02:23:54.220 --> 02:23:59.300]  little enclaves within them but I I've stayed in no-go zone in Paris I was in
[02:23:59.300 --> 02:24:03.180]  London last year I was actually in quite a nice area of London last year in a
[02:24:03.180 --> 02:24:08.260]  very nice hotel there having breakfast and I counted roughly two dozen hotel
[02:24:08.260 --> 02:24:12.860]  guests in there having breakfast with me and if 20 of them weren't Islamist I'd
[02:24:12.860 --> 02:24:18.860]  be surprised and they're bringing in Sharia law I was reading in England in
[02:24:18.860 --> 02:24:23.780]  Sweden in Germany they're introducing legislation to have men and women be
[02:24:23.780 --> 02:24:27.860]  divided the Green Party saying yeah maybe that's the answer this is a
[02:24:27.860 --> 02:24:31.980]  strategic deal with the left and Islam because Europe doesn't have any kids
[02:24:31.980 --> 02:24:35.820]  Islam has six kids versus 1.3 for a couple in the West I mean the deals
[02:24:35.820 --> 02:24:40.740]  been made absolutely you know it's incredible it never fails that even in
[02:24:40.740 --> 02:24:44.020]  the little city that I live in in Switzerland there's there's a pretty
[02:24:44.020 --> 02:24:48.660]  hefty Islamic population here and it never fails that the women are always
[02:24:48.660 --> 02:24:52.580]  with child there's at least one in the baby carriage sometimes two or three and
[02:24:52.580 --> 02:24:56.700]  generally you know the man keeps his distance he gets to wear whatever he
[02:24:56.700 --> 02:25:01.100]  wants and behave however he wants and then the woman is basically expected to
[02:25:01.100 --> 02:25:05.100]  live you know under the shawl or I see some pretty crazy outfits at this point
[02:25:05.100 --> 02:25:08.820]  they're not they're like proud to wear this stuff in public and make us all
[02:25:08.820 --> 02:25:12.220]  feel a little strange when you know whether it's a burqa or some other
[02:25:12.220 --> 02:25:16.020]  type of ceremonial headdress or something and but they always have
[02:25:16.020 --> 02:25:20.060]  children and they have a lot more children that's for sure than Europeans
[02:25:20.060 --> 02:25:24.180]  do so you can see that the game that's being played a civilizational jihad is
[02:25:24.180 --> 02:25:28.500]  definitely ongoing throughout Europe but as you did mention in your and Eastern
[02:25:28.500 --> 02:25:32.420]  Europe things a little bit different I spent a lot of time there last year I
[02:25:32.420 --> 02:25:35.540]  spent two months in Eastern Europe and you don't see the same kind of things
[02:25:35.540 --> 02:25:39.860]  that you see in Western Europe I hardly saw anything that resembled a migrant
[02:25:39.860 --> 02:25:43.740]  and there were very few hijabs and definitely no burqas in that part of
[02:25:43.740 --> 02:25:48.940]  the of the world that I saw so there's definitely a divide in Europe but we've
[02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:52.580]  shown our crews in most areas of Europe are no go zones for white people or
[02:25:52.580 --> 02:25:57.020]  Westerners and this is the plan it's encouraged by the leftist media as you
[02:25:57.020 --> 02:26:01.280]  know Germany runs TV ads for kids in their after-school program saying are
[02:26:01.280 --> 02:26:05.300]  you a 14-year-old girl marry a Muslim man they will treat you right where the
[02:26:05.300 --> 02:26:10.460]  hajjib and then that's a part of the jihad is to wear the hajjib in our
[02:26:10.460 --> 02:26:14.580]  face just to throw it in our face to rub it in and get us ready but what's sad
[02:26:14.580 --> 02:26:19.260]  is to see Europe that was stood 1400 years of Islamic invasion bought off and
[02:26:19.260 --> 02:26:23.500]  sold out to it and and to see the stonings and the attacks and the
[02:26:23.500 --> 02:26:29.540]  rapes and the media defending it is is just truly sickening it is and you know
[02:26:29.540 --> 02:26:33.900]  it's amazing I just spent a few weeks down in Australia in New Zealand I wasn't
[02:26:33.900 --> 02:26:38.620]  sure what to expect there and I spent some time in Melbourne Australia and it
[02:26:38.620 --> 02:26:42.820]  looked just like every other major city in Western Europe and parts of the US
[02:26:42.820 --> 02:26:48.380]  even at times I felt like I wasn't around Australians much of the time and I
[02:26:48.380 --> 02:26:52.980]  found that to be troubling that to see that that has spread just so far across
[02:26:52.980 --> 02:26:57.180]  the Western world it's everywhere there's the deal Latin Americans are the
[02:26:57.180 --> 02:27:01.700]  future because Europeans have 1.3 kids but they're not Islamists and if we can
[02:27:01.700 --> 02:27:05.020]  keep them from being brainwashed by the left they'll make good citizens they're
[02:27:05.020 --> 02:27:08.700]  good people but the Islamists is they're not going to convert to the West they
[02:27:08.700 --> 02:27:12.260]  don't not going to convert to openness they're cancer and you go anywhere in
[02:27:12.260 --> 02:27:16.500]  Austin now it's like I'm living in the middle of an Islamic city and I was
[02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:20.900]  reading statistics in Europe on average 84 percent of Muslim families are on
[02:27:20.900 --> 02:27:25.820]  welfare they come and have six kids they get on welfare the men wear jumpsuits
[02:27:25.820 --> 02:27:31.580]  and an adopt gangster culture it's hideous and it was all over Paris you
[02:27:31.580 --> 02:27:36.020]  name it human feces everywhere the burnings buildings every night cars
[02:27:36.020 --> 02:27:41.100]  being attacked and with a bunch of spoiled rotten crazy people just doing
[02:27:41.100 --> 02:27:45.660]  whatever they want this is this is an insane way to commit suicide it's
[02:27:45.660 --> 02:27:49.900]  depressing to watch there was recently a Hungarian journalist I was interviewing
[02:27:49.900 --> 02:27:53.380]  Victor Orban who I'm sure we're all familiar with at this point and it's
[02:27:53.380 --> 02:27:56.620]  even amazing to see that some of the personalities and in some of these you
[02:27:56.620 --> 02:27:59.980]  know Eastern European countries they feel comfortable talking about the issue at
[02:27:59.980 --> 02:28:03.820]  hand and he said flat out Western civilization is digging its own graves
[02:28:03.820 --> 02:28:09.180]  and we see that happening all over the place and it is troubling and like I
[02:28:09.180 --> 02:28:12.380]  said it's happening in Australia as well and as you said it's happening in the
[02:28:12.380 --> 02:28:16.980]  US I'm wondering why is everyone bowing down to this they allow the craziest
[02:28:16.980 --> 02:28:20.540]  things to go on and it happens the same way in a lot of these cities once the
[02:28:20.540 --> 02:28:25.220]  population of Islamists gets large enough then they'll get out in the
[02:28:25.220 --> 02:28:29.540]  streets they'll go out near stadiums they'll they'll take over entire city
[02:28:29.540 --> 02:28:32.620]  blocks just to do prayer and people need to wake up to this it's getting a
[02:28:32.620 --> 02:28:35.180]  little crazy because we can't go to their countries to do this and they're
[02:28:35.180 --> 02:28:38.180]  all trying to flee their wonderful countries to come here and then turn it
[02:28:38.180 --> 02:28:41.380]  into that there's not even that thought like I hate this I want to leave it but
[02:28:41.380 --> 02:28:45.420]  I'm gonna turn into that once I get there and of course you have interviewed
[02:28:45.420 --> 02:28:48.740]  the Prime Minister of Hungary I want you to interview him again in fact I'm told
[02:28:48.740 --> 02:28:51.660]  you may be doing that forever soon we'll be back with Dan Lyman from the

[02:30:50.380 --> 02:30:56.740]  infowarslife.com everybody needs to try alpha power today I was just about to
[02:30:56.740 --> 02:31:00.340]  walk out of the studio to pick my children up and I got some bad news for
[02:31:00.340 --> 02:31:04.100]  the second time in the five and a half year history of survival shield x2 our
[02:31:04.100 --> 02:31:09.180]  flagship product we are having supply chain problems and this may be the last
[02:31:09.180 --> 02:31:14.020]  batch of this we have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it
[02:31:14.020 --> 02:31:18.220]  actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere and so in our own search to
[02:31:18.220 --> 02:31:22.820]  get the purest form we discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies
[02:31:22.820 --> 02:31:26.740]  had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also
[02:31:26.740 --> 02:31:30.140]  drug makers they used to make drugs and once they figure out there's a market
[02:31:30.140 --> 02:31:36.140]  they start jacking up the price but we're offering it still 25% off until it
[02:31:36.140 --> 02:31:39.620]  sells out hopefully just like the last time this happened a few years ago it's
[02:31:39.620 --> 02:31:43.940]  not an issue and we do get more but right now we are not able to secure the
[02:31:43.940 --> 02:31:48.140]  crystals that produce the purest iodine in the world but what it does is for
[02:31:48.140 --> 02:31:53.420]  Stamina libido focus energy is really amazing survival shield x2 at
[02:31:53.420 --> 02:31:58.580]  infowarsstore.com infowarslife.com they use their media to assassinate real news
[02:31:58.580 --> 02:32:02.420]  they use their schools to teach children that their president is another
[02:32:02.420 --> 02:32:06.980]  Hitler they use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award
[02:32:06.980 --> 02:32:11.820]  shows to repeat their narrative over and over again and then they use their ex
[02:32:11.820 --> 02:32:17.580]  president to endorse the resistance all to make them march make them protest make
[02:32:17.580 --> 02:32:22.220]  them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash

[02:32:27.580 --> 02:32:33.100]  abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop
[02:32:33.100 --> 02:32:37.540]  the madness and when that happens they'll use it as an excuse for their
[02:32:37.540 --> 02:32:43.540]  outrage the only way we stop this the only way we save our country and our
[02:32:43.540 --> 02:32:49.980]  freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth I'm
[02:32:49.980 --> 02:32:59.980]  the National Rifle Association of America and I'm freedom's safest place you're
[02:32:59.980 --> 02:33:04.380]  listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:33:04.380 --> 02:33:23.380]  we're live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide and the head of our
[02:33:23.380 --> 02:33:27.060]  new European Bureau we're launching Dan Lyman doing a great job is here Europe
[02:33:27.060 --> 02:33:35.460]  Wars dot com or Europe dot info wars dot com will take you there whole new
[02:33:35.460 --> 02:33:40.700]  look very very clean site news wars dot com is excellent as well but we are in
[02:33:40.700 --> 02:33:48.060]  a media war we are in a war for the future of Europe and again the left is
[02:33:48.060 --> 02:33:52.140]  not bringing in massive amounts of Islamists is to get them then to convert
[02:33:52.140 --> 02:33:57.460]  to Western culture or even be open to it they want them to be anti-western it's
[02:33:57.460 --> 02:34:01.700]  taught in Switzerland everywhere the stuff you read sounds like Monty Python
[02:34:01.700 --> 02:34:08.300]  it sounds like a joke but it's real women say they go to be raped just and
[02:34:08.300 --> 02:34:12.740]  they go it's okay they rape me I love them and they wouldn't give the time of
[02:34:12.740 --> 02:34:17.740]  day to a swish man or a German person any of that and again every day there's new
[02:34:17.740 --> 02:34:21.580]  no-go zone videos of people having rocks thrown at them you know female
[02:34:21.580 --> 02:34:26.060]  reporters being beaten up and it's the same from Belgium to Italy to Switzerland
[02:34:26.060 --> 02:34:32.260]  in fact Dan Lyman you were telling me about a story that we can pull up about
[02:34:32.260 --> 02:34:37.180]  a Somali individual that tried to burn down a church and people can also follow
[02:34:37.180 --> 02:34:41.980]  you on Twitter at citizen analyst again Dan Lyman you were telling us about a
[02:34:41.980 --> 02:34:47.580]  Somali trying to burn down a church in the Canton or the little state of
[02:34:47.580 --> 02:34:52.340]  Switzerland you live in that's correct I live in a pretty quiet state in here in
[02:34:52.340 --> 02:34:56.020]  Switzerland the most major city is the one I live in and it's not that large
[02:34:56.020 --> 02:35:01.180]  nothing like Zurich or Geneva and and sure enough the other day there's we do
[02:35:01.180 --> 02:35:04.860]  have migrants in town here it's not like Paris or anything like that but there
[02:35:04.860 --> 02:35:08.340]  are enough of them and it's a little unsettling they tend to congregate and
[02:35:08.340 --> 02:35:13.020]  they just like take over little little areas town once in a while and anyways
[02:35:13.020 --> 02:35:18.260]  in the Canton here in a little town nearby there was a Somali refugee quote
[02:35:18.260 --> 02:35:21.860]  unquote that attempted to burn down a Christian church there he wasn't
[02:35:21.860 --> 02:35:25.620]  particularly successful but that's the things that these people are plotting
[02:35:25.620 --> 02:35:29.900]  you know one of the funny things is leftists will throw at you I even heard
[02:35:29.900 --> 02:35:33.260]  a somebody from the Cato Institute kind of making this argument they'll say oh
[02:35:33.260 --> 02:35:38.580]  the likelihood of of you being in affected by a terrorist attack is like
[02:35:38.580 --> 02:35:41.900]  one in millions of millions that's not the point of course the terrorist attack
[02:35:41.900 --> 02:35:46.060]  is quite infrequent and but you know they're becoming more frequent but it's
[02:35:46.060 --> 02:35:50.020]  the day-in day-out crimes of all different types that it that it really is
[02:35:50.020 --> 02:35:53.980]  what what is affecting people and the cost of having these people here is
[02:35:53.980 --> 02:35:58.620]  unbelievable I mean in every European country especially like Germany and
[02:35:58.620 --> 02:36:03.060]  Denmark that the unaccompanied minors who a lot of them you know half to two
[02:36:03.060 --> 02:36:07.740]  thirds end up not being minors they're costing anywhere from 70 to 90,000 per
[02:36:07.740 --> 02:36:12.420]  person per year and that's a low that's passed on to the taxpayers and you have
[02:36:12.420 --> 02:36:15.780]  a lot of these countries as well the older folks the pensioners veterans
[02:36:15.780 --> 02:36:19.180]  they're being treated very poorly well that's the thing I mean you saw what
[02:36:19.180 --> 02:36:22.220]  Macron everybody's acting like a good guy no he's not he said get rid of
[02:36:22.220 --> 02:36:25.940]  nationalism when he was here he said we should have 200 million North Africans
[02:36:25.940 --> 02:36:30.260]  come here Yaddle bankrupt this Yaddle causes civil war so what it's the right
[02:36:30.260 --> 02:36:35.500]  thing to do here's the deal North Africa is a hellhole everywhere it just gets
[02:36:35.500 --> 02:36:39.460]  worse down the eastern coast the Middle East is a hellhole almost everywhere
[02:36:39.460 --> 02:36:44.620]  it's a fact it is cultural it is a conquest society women have no rights
[02:36:44.620 --> 02:36:48.820]  it's one thing to take a few percent of these people and which is still massive
[02:36:48.820 --> 02:36:53.420]  but to bring in tens of millions and have giant tent cities everywhere with
[02:36:53.420 --> 02:36:58.020]  people direing all over the place I mean they say it's killed 80% of the
[02:36:58.020 --> 02:37:02.420]  tourism in France Paul's family moved to France 15 years ago they had to move
[02:37:02.420 --> 02:37:07.780]  out to Spain and I mean it's just insane asylum I mean I went to Rome and it
[02:37:07.780 --> 02:37:11.420]  looks just like what you're seeing down the main thoroughfare this is I mean
[02:37:11.420 --> 02:37:15.940]  what what are the globalist thinking what are the leftist thinking I don't
[02:37:15.940 --> 02:37:19.780]  know I've seen these same scenes in multiple European cities Paris looks
[02:37:19.780 --> 02:37:23.660]  just like that in a lot of parts and and now I have friends who asked me where to
[02:37:23.660 --> 02:37:27.620]  go to Europe and Europe and I say just don't even bother it's not worth it go
[02:37:27.620 --> 02:37:32.260]  to go to maybe a lesser known place try Budapest Budapest is a great place yes
[02:37:32.260 --> 02:37:36.380]  crazy and you know what's funny is it's like every year the number that were
[02:37:36.380 --> 02:37:40.180]  expected to swallow becomes more like little by little there they're turning
[02:37:40.180 --> 02:37:43.660]  up the heat oh yeah don't forget that part what they're threatening what is a
[02:37:43.660 --> 02:37:49.060]  million euro fine for every quote refugee that countries don't take in
[02:37:49.060 --> 02:37:53.860]  Hungary and Poland tell folks about that sure yeah they're turning up
[02:37:53.860 --> 02:37:57.020]  constantly turning up the heat on the countries that won't accept these
[02:37:57.020 --> 02:38:00.580]  migrant quotas and now you have all the leaders they're just filling the beans
[02:38:00.580 --> 02:38:04.860]  they're saying it's unlimited it's limitless it's not 10,000 it's not a
[02:38:04.860 --> 02:38:08.700]  hundred thousand it's not even a million now they're talking at they're
[02:38:08.700 --> 02:38:12.900]  talking 150 to 200 million that's Adam Macron's mouth basically when he's
[02:38:12.900 --> 02:38:16.020]  talking about what we should be preparing for in the next 30 years they're
[02:38:16.020 --> 02:38:19.980]  not even saying by you know 2100 they're saying in the next 30 years and then
[02:38:19.980 --> 02:38:23.500]  you had a UN official who actually was appointed by Trump so I think that's
[02:38:23.500 --> 02:38:28.540]  probably why we got quite a bit of truth 500 million ISIS plans 500 million and
[02:38:28.540 --> 02:38:31.780]  remember they're coordinating with the socialists in Europe sorry go ahead
[02:38:31.780 --> 02:38:35.420]  absolutely and these coincide with figures that people like Gert Wilders
[02:38:35.420 --> 02:38:38.860]  and the Netherlands have been warning about saying you know the population of
[02:38:38.860 --> 02:38:43.380]  Africa is set to explode to something like 4 billion by the 20 you know the
[02:38:43.380 --> 02:38:48.180]  22nd century and a lot of them are being driven this way through for a
[02:38:48.180 --> 02:38:51.620]  variety of reasons you look all the way down to South Africa what's going on
[02:38:51.620 --> 02:38:55.220]  there if they if they eliminate all the farmers there and there's another there's
[02:38:55.220 --> 02:38:59.180]  a famine or they're you know those people are gonna be driven up let's be
[02:38:59.180 --> 02:39:04.460]  clear let's be clear white people are not tolerated in anything below tiny
[02:39:04.460 --> 02:39:09.740]  minority numbers in Asia in most areas of Latin America and in Africa so if
[02:39:09.740 --> 02:39:13.780]  white people can't even have part of Europe and it's run by anti-white
[02:39:13.780 --> 02:39:16.300]  leftists who just want to conquer everything they see the demographic
[02:39:16.300 --> 02:39:20.420]  numbers they want to turn these majorities that are quote minorities into
[02:39:20.420 --> 02:39:25.180]  belligerent racial mobs so it's basically the EU is using a Hitlerian
[02:39:25.180 --> 02:39:29.220]  strategy for global domination just like Hitler when he cooked up the whole
[02:39:29.220 --> 02:39:34.540]  plan people don't know that Hitler had African brigades Arab brigades he had
[02:39:34.540 --> 02:39:39.460]  big fans in central and South America all racial-based politics as well people
[02:39:39.460 --> 02:39:43.700]  don't get this that they've double crossed the Christian ethos of Europe
[02:39:43.700 --> 02:39:47.420]  trying to end slavery trying to open things up they put the guilt back on to
[02:39:47.420 --> 02:39:51.500]  us and gotten us to accept the identity politics but only for us to commit
[02:39:51.500 --> 02:39:56.580]  suicide but that's only so technocrats can destroy the first world and not
[02:39:56.580 --> 02:39:59.340]  only that they've even gotten a lot of the Christian organizations they've
[02:39:59.340 --> 02:40:03.300]  subverted them into accepting this and fully pushing it there was a church in
[02:40:03.300 --> 02:40:07.820]  Melbourne Australian Anglican church huge one facing a big tourist square and
[02:40:07.820 --> 02:40:12.740]  it had unfurled a massive refugees welcome banner from one of the like the
[02:40:12.740 --> 02:40:16.660]  wall facing where all the people are I mean the propaganda is incessant you
[02:40:16.660 --> 02:40:20.820]  see it here it's all the world Council of Churches the Methodist Church it's
[02:40:20.820 --> 02:40:24.900]  not liberal help poor people then of the Catholic Church all of it is weaponize
[02:40:24.900 --> 02:40:29.740]  them bring them in they're bringing down anybody being middle-class this is
[02:40:29.740 --> 02:40:33.740]  turning the world poor this is feudalism and they're using a demonic fake
[02:40:33.740 --> 02:40:39.500]  Christian church to help Christianity commit suicide absolutely and I had
[02:40:39.500 --> 02:40:43.660]  another revelation kind of when I was in in Melbourne and I'm sure other people
[02:40:43.660 --> 02:40:47.260]  have picked up on this but when you consider the you know the agenda 21
[02:40:47.260 --> 02:40:50.860]  type planning where they are pushing people out of the rural areas into the
[02:40:50.860 --> 02:40:54.580]  city so you're getting like a total inversion of the population that are
[02:40:54.580 --> 02:40:58.060]  all moving into these cities but not only that they're using a lot of these
[02:40:58.060 --> 02:41:01.900]  cities like the ones that the like UN really will tout like Austin like
[02:41:01.900 --> 02:41:06.260]  Melbourne like Sydney and they're they're not only driving the the country
[02:41:06.260 --> 02:41:10.380]  folk into the cities to seek jobs they're also bringing in hundreds of
[02:41:10.380 --> 02:41:15.060]  thousands if not millions of people from the third world as well who are
[02:41:15.060 --> 02:41:18.220]  expected to bring take them in because you know they're looking for jobs and
[02:41:18.220 --> 02:41:22.140]  their refugees or whatever in Melbourne alone their population is going 100 to
[02:41:22.140 --> 02:41:26.380]  150,000 people per year and I let's be clear let's be clear under the UN
[02:41:26.380 --> 02:41:31.380]  Obama did this here he said the rural areas are too white so they bring in
[02:41:31.380 --> 02:41:35.780]  third-world populations and send them to your local town to then outvote you and
[02:41:35.780 --> 02:41:39.220]  take over so the globalist can exploit you they're not helping these poor third
[02:41:39.220 --> 02:41:43.740]  world people this is a very diabolical plan it's an admitted plan how do we
[02:41:43.740 --> 02:41:48.340]  stop it Dan Lyman because the world is waking up oh it's gonna take some
[02:41:48.340 --> 02:41:52.300]  serious fight we have to look to the leaders that are taking a stand and
[02:41:52.300 --> 02:41:55.540]  it's gonna take a lot more people speaking up I think people have to be
[02:41:55.540 --> 02:41:58.780]  they have to just stop worrying about what other people think about what they
[02:41:58.780 --> 02:42:03.300]  say because the more people speak up the majority of people do not want this
[02:42:03.300 --> 02:42:06.580]  but also the majority of that majority stay quiet because they're worried about
[02:42:06.580 --> 02:42:09.460]  their jobs are worried about what their friends will think of them sorry but
[02:42:09.460 --> 02:42:12.300]  you've got a dry line in the sand because eventually you will have no
[02:42:12.300 --> 02:42:16.500]  civilization to worry about and no job to worry about either but if the people
[02:42:16.500 --> 02:42:21.100]  showing up were nice then that would be fine but it's like foam at the mouth
[02:42:21.100 --> 02:42:24.860]  we're gonna kill you they sell women in the sex labor they throw gays off
[02:42:24.860 --> 02:42:29.700]  buildings and they've got the Muslim women leading the women's marches but no
[02:42:29.700 --> 02:42:34.940]  pro-lifers are allowed more more white women and hit jobs these days too it's
[02:42:34.940 --> 02:42:39.620]  disturbing well I mean it's an absolute planned suicide because they train
[02:42:39.620 --> 02:42:43.220]  women not to want a man around so they go to the real radical level of wanting
[02:42:43.220 --> 02:42:47.780]  a pimp and under Islam he will treat you like you're a street hooker he will
[02:42:47.780 --> 02:42:53.820]  pimp go-ass good and you're gonna love it he'll be right back stay with us

[02:47:55.980 --> 02:48:01.380]  covering it all but the globalists the big mega corporations have decided they
[02:48:01.380 --> 02:48:06.340]  like authoritarianism they decided they like radical Islam they've been
[02:48:06.340 --> 02:48:09.980]  outlive with Saudi Arabia to basically you know buy most are oil from them
[02:48:09.980 --> 02:48:13.820]  since the 70s and things are just getting crazier they're just getting
[02:48:13.820 --> 02:48:19.460]  worse now a lot of good things are happening on the local scene in different
[02:48:19.460 --> 02:48:22.700]  parts of the world but in the big picture the globalist are out of control
[02:48:22.700 --> 02:48:27.940]  you've got nationalism populism being awakened everywhere but you've got the
[02:48:27.940 --> 02:48:34.180]  culture and all the mall shops whether in Europe or the US you walk by gap and
[02:48:34.180 --> 02:48:40.020]  it's women in Egypt it's all being force-fed instead of wanting to free these
[02:48:40.020 --> 02:48:47.500]  women Mall of America now has become a little Mogadishu and you've got Linda
[02:48:47.500 --> 02:48:52.580]  Sorcer criticizing Iranian women a few months ago who protested refused to wear
[02:48:52.580 --> 02:48:56.940]  hijabs well that's not feminist the feminists are like stop being a

[02:49:02.220 --> 02:49:07.020]  feminism are being completely pipped by this thing Dan Lyman of Europe Wars
[02:49:07.020 --> 02:49:12.780]  dot com or Europe dot info wars dot com our Europe division any tips you've got
[02:49:12.780 --> 02:49:16.260]  you can send him to him obviously at his Twitter as well it was just had up on
[02:49:16.260 --> 02:49:20.340]  screen a lot of powerful articles a lot of exclusives he's got a few writers
[02:49:20.340 --> 02:49:23.980]  he's getting set up to also help with the site some of our articles that Paul
[02:49:23.980 --> 02:49:27.900]  and Steve Wright will also be posted there but he is a one-man show right
[02:49:27.900 --> 02:49:33.860]  now hiring some more people doing some just a fabulous job looking at this
[02:49:33.860 --> 02:49:41.100]  pulling back from this this new Islamic ahead of immigration for England it's
[02:49:41.100 --> 02:49:49.060]  so epic it's so big it's so insane where do you and your gut see this going and
[02:49:49.060 --> 02:49:53.260]  what are other big stories you think people should know about that question
[02:49:53.260 --> 02:49:58.780]  is always a doozy because nobody wants to think it's gonna go the way that we
[02:49:58.780 --> 02:50:02.860]  that many places I think are going to go these people have worked very hard to
[02:50:02.860 --> 02:50:07.740]  get here they're working very hard on civilizational jihad and they're not
[02:50:07.740 --> 02:50:12.180]  going to go peacefully into that good night so in certain places where the
[02:50:12.180 --> 02:50:19.340]  the population is overwhelming ie Sweden Germany the UK it doesn't bode well
[02:50:19.340 --> 02:50:22.860]  and also what's really disturbing is that the governments are so clearly
[02:50:22.860 --> 02:50:26.580]  they're in favor of this they're on the sides of a side of these people you have
[02:50:26.580 --> 02:50:30.940]  for instance migrants took over like a town square in Lesbos in Greece
[02:50:30.940 --> 02:50:35.620]  recently and then they were protested by the locals and the police formed a
[02:50:35.620 --> 02:50:39.460]  cordon around the migrants to protect them and they you know enforce their
[02:50:39.460 --> 02:50:43.980]  will on the locals you're not allowed to to protest against having your town
[02:50:43.980 --> 02:50:48.580]  invaded and then another example there's a generation identitaire they
[02:50:48.580 --> 02:50:52.580]  recently staged it's kind of a stunt but it was more than symbolic they were a
[02:50:52.580 --> 02:50:56.100]  bit effective but they went to the French Alps where thousands of migrants
[02:50:56.100 --> 02:50:59.660]  are known to be crossing with the aid of leftists open borders leftists from
[02:50:59.660 --> 02:51:03.780]  their crossing from Italy into France so this this group of about a hundred or
[02:51:03.780 --> 02:51:08.300]  kind of a youth identity movement they went and they stage basically a blockade
[02:51:08.300 --> 02:51:12.660]  and it was enough to gain international attention and of course the French
[02:51:12.660 --> 02:51:16.340]  government denounced them slam them didn't say anything about the leftist
[02:51:16.340 --> 02:51:20.140]  activists and then the next day some of the leaders of this group including
[02:51:20.140 --> 02:51:24.180]  Martin Selner who was just banned from entering the UK they had their homes
[02:51:24.180 --> 02:51:29.420]  raided by the Austrian government so it's it's a such an uphill battle for
[02:51:29.420 --> 02:51:34.300]  those of us who want to protect where it is that we live and live in safety I
[02:51:34.300 --> 02:51:38.420]  just can't believe that the leftist elites are letting it destroy totally
[02:51:38.420 --> 02:51:44.300]  destroy tourism because as you know some numbers are as high as 80% the
[02:51:44.300 --> 02:51:49.940]  places like Paris is gone yeah it is amazing but they have to be finding
[02:51:49.940 --> 02:51:54.140]  their funding elsewhere that something is keeping keeping them afloat yeah I
[02:51:54.140 --> 02:51:58.940]  personally would not visit any any of the those cities at this point for for
[02:51:58.940 --> 02:52:02.020]  pleasure I would do it for work but I wouldn't go there I mean yeah like that
[02:52:02.020 --> 02:52:05.060]  footage you're rolling right there this kind of stuff is happening everywhere
[02:52:05.060 --> 02:52:09.500]  it's terrifying that's female reporters being attacked for just going into the
[02:52:09.500 --> 02:52:15.220]  no-go zones just for reporting even the press isn't safe at this point even
[02:52:15.220 --> 02:52:19.180]  people like Tommy Robinson I mean he's kind of been the the harbinger and tell
[02:52:19.180 --> 02:52:22.340]  it warning us all and people really need to listen to the things that he has to
[02:52:22.340 --> 02:52:25.140]  say and there are people like that all over the world now that are starting to
[02:52:25.140 --> 02:52:29.780]  pop up even in the governments you have the Danish the immigration minister she
[02:52:29.780 --> 02:52:33.220]  spoke up recently and and she's she's pretty good she's kind of hardline and
[02:52:33.220 --> 02:52:37.700]  she said you know basically these people are cheating us they're not here for to
[02:52:37.700 --> 02:52:40.860]  integrate they're not even here to learn Danish and they get a lot of help from
[02:52:40.860 --> 02:52:44.220]  leftists on the other side that are that are making sure that they can skirt the
[02:52:44.220 --> 02:52:49.060]  system bring in as many as possible and at any cost to the taxpayers they don't
[02:52:49.060 --> 02:52:53.820]  care well you followed your report to us in the future you'll just do it
[02:52:53.820 --> 02:52:58.260]  directly to Facebook YouTube info wars but you just got back from Australia you
[02:52:58.260 --> 02:53:00.980]  interviewed the Tommy Robinson of Australia and we're going to be
[02:53:00.980 --> 02:53:06.780]  premiering that either today or tomorrow here on air great job mr. Lyman any
[02:53:06.780 --> 02:53:11.060]  other key points you'd like to add just like to tell everyone to stay engaged
[02:53:11.060 --> 02:53:15.060]  share our articles you would oh very quickly you'd be amazed what our reach
[02:53:15.060 --> 02:53:19.500]  is in New Zealand at real quick I was in a very rural part of New Zealand I didn't
[02:53:19.500 --> 02:53:23.500]  even have cell phone service and I came across a huge placard in front of
[02:53:23.500 --> 02:53:28.060]  someone's driveway that had a big info wars label and you know know the
[02:53:28.060 --> 02:53:31.340]  globalism all these slogans and it was in the middle of nowhere in New Zealand so
[02:53:31.340 --> 02:53:35.140]  you have no idea how far our reach is but it is every corner of the world so
[02:53:35.140 --> 02:53:38.420]  please share the articles and just get the word out there keep waking people up
[02:53:38.420 --> 02:53:43.620]  about two years ago I climbed up on some standing stones that weren't real
[02:53:43.620 --> 02:53:47.740]  popular to go to somebody was around off the highway in southern England and I
[02:53:47.740 --> 02:53:51.300]  kind of didn't like it because I don't like graffiti on things like that but
[02:53:51.300 --> 02:53:56.940]  carved into one of them was info wars calm and I was like wow that's crazy and
[02:53:56.940 --> 02:54:00.300]  then you just see it everywhere that's why the goal that's what the globalist
[02:54:00.300 --> 02:54:03.220]  demonizes are trying to shut us down trying to misrepresent who we are
[02:54:03.220 --> 02:54:07.180]  trying to make people be scared to be associated with us they want a bunch of
[02:54:07.180 --> 02:54:10.860]  timid slums ladies and gentlemen but all over the world especially I'm told
[02:54:10.860 --> 02:54:14.020]  I haven't been to Eastern Europe yet but I'm told by Max Kaiser who by the way
[02:54:14.020 --> 02:54:17.260]  is almost tomorrow and others that if you go to Eastern Europe and even the
[02:54:17.260 --> 02:54:20.180]  Middle East because a lot of Muslims don't live in their orthodox Islam or
[02:54:20.180 --> 02:54:25.500]  come on orthodox you know radical out of control obvious Islam Max has talked
[02:54:25.500 --> 02:54:29.180]  about in the show in Egypt and you name it that there's huge info wars listeners
[02:54:29.180 --> 02:54:34.140]  that they recognize him from info wars not even from RT or BBC and I'm not
[02:54:34.140 --> 02:54:37.180]  bragging it's just that we don't realize the reach we've got until we go out
[02:54:37.180 --> 02:54:42.380]  there where you pick with us that's for sure so just keep getting the word out
[02:54:42.380 --> 02:54:45.020]  there I think we're one of the few outlets that is willing to tell the truth
[02:54:45.020 --> 02:54:48.860]  about a lot of the things that are going on right now well Dan you're doing an
[02:54:48.860 --> 02:54:52.420]  amazing job just in 60 seconds what do you make of this Iran thing I mean I'm
[02:54:52.420 --> 02:54:55.940]  just sick of these wars we elected Trump not to have these wars but he did say
[02:54:55.940 --> 02:54:59.700]  he'd be tough when I ran that's he said he wouldn't go out for Syria he's kind
[02:54:59.700 --> 02:55:02.700]  of starting to fudge on that I'm still real happy with him but I'm mad about
[02:55:02.700 --> 02:55:07.700]  that but at the same time this Iran situation Netanyahu showed some pretty
[02:55:07.700 --> 02:55:12.300]  strong evidence definitely and it's amazing it seems like every time we get
[02:55:12.300 --> 02:55:17.500]  to catch our breath with war and and see a little sliver of peace on the
[02:55:17.500 --> 02:55:21.300]  horizon it seems like something new comes up so it's just it's just a hit
[02:55:21.300 --> 02:55:25.340]  after hit and I and I only hope for peace across the planet and it's great
[02:55:25.340 --> 02:55:29.020]  to see what's going on in Korea I'm very interested to see what plays out and I
[02:55:29.020 --> 02:55:32.540]  ran we'll see well I think that's because Trump said no more games we'll see
[02:55:32.540 --> 02:55:35.180]  what happens the left in the globalist you're really trying to stop us Dan

[03:00:05.540 --> 03:00:23.460]  isn't it great to see a president being cheered for peace and for being on the
[03:00:23.460 --> 03:00:27.740]  very cusp of the Korean War officially being ended and the denuclearization of
[03:00:27.740 --> 03:00:32.780]  the peninsula isn't something like this what we want to see from a political
[03:00:32.780 --> 03:00:37.140]  party or a nation's people and said the Democrats are chanting for more war and
[03:00:37.140 --> 03:00:41.940]  they love the fact that Obama got a peace prize for launching seven wars what
[03:00:41.940 --> 03:00:49.220]  a joke here's Trump we're not playing games and I remember you know it was very
[03:00:49.220 --> 03:00:55.460]  rough three four months ago
[03:00:55.460 --> 03:01:03.260]  no bell no bell no bell the media says Trump doesn't get credit for any of us they say he was going to already cause a
[03:01:03.260 --> 03:01:06.980]  nuclear war that was impressive and peace happens the two leaders meeting in
[03:01:06.980 --> 03:01:12.660]  Korea they say it's not Trump that did it that's very nice a lot of states the
[03:01:12.660 --> 03:01:16.900]  American people are military bring the pressure to bear and I sure hope it has
[03:01:16.900 --> 03:01:21.020]  bigger success but here's South Korea's foreign minister this is who the foreign
[03:01:21.020 --> 03:01:28.020]  minister gives credit to if we would have this is to the South Korean minister
[03:01:28.020 --> 03:01:31.820]  gives credit to after this clip we're gonna go to Lindsey Graham here it is
[03:01:31.820 --> 03:01:37.340]  are you surprised by how quickly this moment has arrived in this phase that
[03:01:37.340 --> 03:01:41.700]  just four months ago Kim Jong-un was talking about pressing nuclear buttons
[03:01:41.700 --> 03:01:45.340]  from his desk and President Trump was responding in kind I feel like somebody
[03:01:45.340 --> 03:01:48.640]  stepped on the accelerator at the beginning of the year and it's been
[03:01:48.640 --> 03:01:54.060]  non-substance then how do you account for it clearly you know credit goes to
[03:01:54.060 --> 03:01:59.820]  President Trump he's been determined to come to grips with this from day one and
[03:01:59.820 --> 03:02:04.060]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen here we're gonna go to this Lindsey
[03:02:04.060 --> 03:02:08.020]  Graham clip here in a moment with the heads exploding of the Liberals here it
[03:02:08.020 --> 03:02:13.540]  does if he can lead us to ending the Korean War after 70 years and getting
[03:02:13.540 --> 03:02:17.740]  North Korea to give up their nuclear program in a verifiable way deserves a
[03:02:17.740 --> 03:02:23.780]  Nobel Peace Prize and then some yeah will he get it I mean obviously this is
[03:02:23.780 --> 03:02:27.340]  something that the mainstream media will push back at but you're right if
[03:02:27.340 --> 03:02:31.820]  this is actually materializing what an enormous accomplishment of president
[03:02:31.820 --> 03:02:35.740]  I want to be there there may be the first time the Nobel Peace Prize was given
[03:02:35.740 --> 03:02:39.220]  and there was mass casualties because I think a lot of liberals would kill
[03:02:39.220 --> 03:02:43.060]  themselves if they did that but the bottom line is by any objective measure
[03:02:43.060 --> 03:02:48.340]  where President Trump has done is historic he made it so there you go he
[03:02:48.340 --> 03:02:50.660]  made the decision to put pressure on them instead of going along with the
[03:02:50.660 --> 03:02:53.980]  same policy and now that's brought him to the peace table yeah that make their
[03:02:53.980 --> 03:02:59.860]  heads explode they might kill themselves if that's the case when we come back I'm
[03:02:59.860 --> 03:03:03.940]  gonna get Gerald Salentes take on this to see where he thinks this is really

[03:05:48.380 --> 03:05:57.860]  is the Alex Jones show and now the trends forecaster Gerald Salente is
[03:05:57.860 --> 03:06:03.020]  taking over for the hour but I wanted to ask him as somebody who's really traveled
[03:06:03.020 --> 03:06:08.300]  the world who's really studied in depth what does he think is behind Trump
[03:06:08.300 --> 03:06:11.900]  going after Iran what does he thinks behind Netanyahu and this big
[03:06:11.900 --> 03:06:15.940]  presentation today with a hundred thousand documents and all these video
[03:06:15.940 --> 03:06:22.060]  displays and all these graphics that they supposedly stole with spies from the
[03:06:22.060 --> 03:06:25.700]  Iranians I know the Iranians have been developing atomic weapons for a while
[03:06:25.700 --> 03:06:30.180]  they were admitting it earlier they denied it later I don't think this is
[03:06:30.180 --> 03:06:35.700]  like lying about WMD's but my issue is the argument of North Korea and Iran is
[03:06:35.700 --> 03:06:40.460]  if you don't have nukes you get invaded like Iraq or like Syria or like Libya and
[03:06:40.460 --> 03:06:45.060]  so I see Saudi Arabia running the Wahhabist arm worldwide that the Sunnis
[03:06:45.060 --> 03:06:49.460]  80% of Islam trying to invade Europe working with the globalist working with
[03:06:49.460 --> 03:06:54.660]  the socialist as part of this larger jihad plan the minority of Islam is the
[03:06:54.660 --> 03:07:00.540]  Shiites 19% the other 1% Alawite and other minority groups as you know and so
[03:07:00.540 --> 03:07:04.260]  Gerald of trends research calm I wanted to get your take as best-selling author
[03:07:04.260 --> 03:07:08.620]  researcher advisor to governments about the larger strategy because I don't want
[03:07:08.620 --> 03:07:12.420]  Iran to do Israel and I know Iran's has a lot of belligerent things and I know
[03:07:12.420 --> 03:07:15.740]  the Iran moolas aren't popular and that the young people want them out I get all
[03:07:15.740 --> 03:07:22.220]  that I'm not an enemy of Israel but at the same time this strategy of the Saudi
[03:07:22.220 --> 03:07:26.180]  Arabian Crown Prince coming over and doing this this this charm offensive
[03:07:26.180 --> 03:07:30.580]  and and wanting us to attack Syria to get rid of Assad and all of this is about
[03:07:30.580 --> 03:07:37.460]  knocking out Saudi Arabia's enemy the Shiites and Hezbollah we know that it's
[03:07:37.460 --> 03:07:42.620]  just that doesn't Trump like getting cheered Nobel Prize Nobel Prize having
[03:07:42.620 --> 03:07:46.180]  the South Korean president nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize isn't that
[03:07:46.180 --> 03:07:51.020]  better than going down this war road I mean how ironic would it be just like
[03:07:51.020 --> 03:07:55.420]  President-elect Obama launched seven wars and he got a peace prize before he
[03:07:55.420 --> 03:07:59.500]  ever got into office well will it be a sick joke where you know Trump's
[03:07:59.500 --> 03:08:02.860]  nominated for a peace prize that launches a huge war with Iran and again I
[03:08:02.860 --> 03:08:06.700]  know Iran threatened to sink our ships again this week I know this was a bad
[03:08:06.700 --> 03:08:11.140]  deal Obama did I know there's a lot of double dealing going on it just at the
[03:08:11.140 --> 03:08:15.660]  same time I don't want to bring down Iran and then have Saudi Arabia use that
[03:08:15.660 --> 03:08:19.220]  to flood Europe with its whole Islamic invasion which we know they're doing so
[03:08:19.220 --> 03:08:25.900]  I wanted to get your expert take on that we were saying actually about three weeks
[03:08:25.900 --> 03:08:29.380]  after Trump got elected and we were writing it in the Trends Journal and
[03:08:29.380 --> 03:08:36.300]  putting out trend alerts that Israel the United States and Saudi Arabia were
[03:08:36.300 --> 03:08:44.620]  lining to go after Iran and it's really about the Saudi trip and the Israeli
[03:08:44.620 --> 03:08:48.620]  trip in a very big way and as you pointed out if you want to talk about
[03:08:48.620 --> 03:08:54.180]  radicals look at all the ones that the Saudis have armed in the overthrow of
[03:08:54.180 --> 03:08:59.540]  Libya that was Saudi Arabia and the Arab League and then of course Obama Hillary
[03:08:59.540 --> 03:09:05.700]  Clinton Samantha Power and Susan Rice along with Saqozi and Cameron jumped
[03:09:05.700 --> 03:09:12.020]  on board to overthrow Qaddafi it was the richest nation in Africa they were a
[03:09:12.020 --> 03:09:16.380]  threat to no one and they brought up that whole human rights thing but
[03:09:16.380 --> 03:09:21.980]  ironically as they were talking about that Yemen was falling apart and Yemen
[03:09:21.980 --> 03:09:27.260]  the leader at the time was slaughtering many more people than than Qaddafi
[03:09:27.260 --> 03:09:33.220]  allegedly had so going back to Saudi Arabia where's Saudi Arabia well they
[03:09:33.220 --> 03:09:37.020]  invaded Yemen they don't like the government that's there the Houthi
[03:09:37.020 --> 03:09:41.620]  government and by the way the Houthis have been there over a thousand years
[03:09:41.620 --> 03:09:48.300]  and Yemen just split up in the 90s who's north and south at one time and so
[03:09:48.300 --> 03:09:55.780]  that's what that's all about but when did Saudi Arabia begin about 1934 so it's
[03:09:55.780 --> 03:10:01.540]  this Saudi trip and and what it is also going on what we've been saying and
[03:10:01.540 --> 03:10:06.380]  again look what's going on in Israel with the Gaza protests what are they
[03:10:06.380 --> 03:10:13.580]  wounded according to the reports you know about four 5,000 people about 45 dead
[03:10:13.580 --> 03:10:18.780]  and you know they've turned that place into a Palestinian prison there's no I
[03:10:18.780 --> 03:10:23.740]  mean who would want to live in those conditions Alex when all else fails they
[03:10:23.740 --> 03:10:28.220]  they take you to war and that's what's going on you have a real financial
[03:10:28.220 --> 03:10:35.900]  problem going on in Saudi Arabia they need oil at $100 a barrel to break
[03:10:35.900 --> 03:10:42.140]  even on their budget and you hear the crown prince talking about we want oil
[03:10:42.140 --> 03:10:48.460]  between 80 and a hundred dollars a barrel two-thirds two-thirds of their
[03:10:48.460 --> 03:10:54.380]  workers are supported by the state so what and let's be clear just since Trump
[03:10:54.380 --> 03:10:58.020]  did this deal where they were going to supposedly stop funding jihadis we now
[03:10:58.020 --> 03:11:02.420]  see oil gone up $15 a barrel they say it's going to 80 where they want it
[03:11:02.420 --> 03:11:06.500]  Saudi Arabia more and more is getting what they want this is the tail wagging
[03:11:06.500 --> 03:11:12.980]  the dog undoubtedly here exactly and that's what this is about what was it
[03:11:12.980 --> 03:11:15.740]  about we would have that you've heard me say this you think we would have
[03:11:15.740 --> 03:11:21.980]  invaded Iraq if they had major export product was broccoli no same thing in
[03:11:21.980 --> 03:11:26.540]  Libya do you agree with me then do you agree with me I mean the Iran's going
[03:11:26.540 --> 03:11:30.140]  off the dollar under the euro all the signs are there that Netanyahu given
[03:11:30.140 --> 03:11:36.180]  the speech is basically the major ramp up to a strike on Iran yes and what look
[03:11:36.180 --> 03:11:41.740]  what just happened last night that's not in the news they attacked Syria again
[03:11:41.740 --> 03:11:48.060]  they killed over a dozen Iranians and in an air base near Aleppo a military
[03:11:48.060 --> 03:11:52.460]  placed and they they they don't know who did it whether it was the United
[03:11:52.460 --> 03:11:58.580]  States Israel or the UK so they're sending missiles in again and again
[03:11:58.580 --> 03:12:03.220]  it's and notice you notice it's one missile it's like a test to see if we'll
[03:12:03.220 --> 03:12:10.500]  even pay attention yes here this is last week Israeli war with Iran
[03:12:10.500 --> 03:12:21.060]  increasingly likely who said that Mattis April 26th then we're hearing the
[03:12:21.060 --> 03:12:28.980]  defense secretary over there Lieberman talking about these three things that we
[03:12:28.980 --> 03:12:35.940]  that have problems Iran Iran and Iran so you could now Pompeo went over there
[03:12:35.940 --> 03:12:41.340]  what did he meet with the crown prince Netanyahu what are they talking about
[03:12:41.340 --> 03:12:49.380]  Iran and war here's our forecast if this thing if there's war against Iran
[03:12:49.380 --> 03:12:55.740]  kiss the markets goodbye oil prices will spike back to the hundred and fifty
[03:12:55.740 --> 03:13:03.980]  dollar a barrel it'll crash the global economies go prices will soar and then
[03:13:03.980 --> 03:13:09.900]  also we're telling our subscribers if this should happen watch those crypto
[03:13:09.900 --> 03:13:16.540]  currencies as well and see what they do this thing is going to destroy the
[03:13:16.540 --> 03:13:23.740]  equity markets go back to 2008 when oil prices were going toward a hundred and
[03:13:23.740 --> 03:13:30.220]  fifty dollars a barrel and bam the panic came on and we already mentioned
[03:13:30.220 --> 03:13:36.140]  how much oil prices have gone up so that's already about five hundred dollars
[03:13:36.140 --> 03:13:42.900]  a year already out of the pocket of the average middle-class family in increased
[03:13:42.900 --> 03:13:49.540]  gas prices and then you look at GD you look at retail we gotta go to break and
[03:13:49.540 --> 03:13:52.220]  I'm gonna have you take over right now with your expert mind on this is why
[03:13:52.220 --> 03:13:55.660]  it's so good to have you here when this is all happening today but if we just
[03:13:55.660 --> 03:13:59.300]  pull back from this Trump will end up destroying his legacy with this Iran
[03:13:59.300 --> 03:14:02.900]  situation it's gonna be a giant war like you said it's gonna totally screw up
[03:14:02.900 --> 03:14:06.900]  the economy the Iranians are Persian it's not gonna be like Iraq they're gonna
[03:14:06.900 --> 03:14:11.100]  trigger sleeper cells all over Europe has below sleeper cells it's gonna get
[03:14:11.100 --> 03:14:16.300]  really really bad and out of this crisis I just I just hope we make it you know
[03:14:16.300 --> 03:14:21.420]  out of it I hope this is all rhetoric so Iran comes to the table and you know
[03:14:21.420 --> 03:14:25.020]  sews for peace and gives up their nuclear weapons program but just briefly
[03:14:25.020 --> 03:14:29.980]  before we go to break do you think there's any chance of that no I really
[03:14:29.980 --> 03:14:35.340]  don't not from the language coming out from the crown prince from Pompeo from
[03:14:35.340 --> 03:14:43.580]  Bolton and and from Netanyahu in Lieberman I don't see that I know North
[03:14:43.580 --> 03:14:46.780]  Korea suddenly wanted to go along with things I think they've been told big
[03:14:46.780 --> 03:14:51.780]  wars coming you better get in line yeah it's you mentioned also you said these
[03:14:51.780 --> 03:14:56.660]  are the Persians they're not the Iraqis and and when you look again and I've
[03:14:56.660 --> 03:15:02.580]  read the details of they're really truly not in violation of the UN agreement
[03:15:02.580 --> 03:15:09.140]  by by with these missile testings well and when we say that is a whole bunch
[03:15:09.140 --> 03:15:11.340]  of them will get ready to die and they'll be more coordinated than when
[03:15:11.340 --> 03:15:14.780]  we're fighting the Arabs and it's not gonna be a good situation but this is

[03:20:28.100 --> 03:20:33.860]  to keep buying those products and getting the truth out there and having Alex
[03:20:33.860 --> 03:20:39.860]  have people like myself and others on to give the reviews and observations based
[03:20:39.860 --> 03:20:46.700]  on facts rather than buying into propaganda and belief systems motto of
[03:20:46.700 --> 03:20:50.980]  the trends journalists think for yourself and Alex was mentioning before
[03:20:50.980 --> 03:20:59.100]  about North Korea and where's that going and all the data coming out by the way
[03:20:59.100 --> 03:21:06.820]  from South Korea is that in fact they are pointing at Trump as pushing this
[03:21:06.820 --> 03:21:13.460]  forward by the actions that he took earlier I mean it did seem a bit extreme
[03:21:13.460 --> 03:21:18.500]  but apparently it worked and it's also let's not forget to the Chinese playing
[03:21:18.500 --> 03:21:22.820]  a very big role in this and so too is Russia they're both on the border of
[03:21:22.820 --> 03:21:30.980]  North Korea and their influence also is very instrumental in this so peace is
[03:21:30.980 --> 03:21:35.940]  the way to go there's no profit in war that's the big lie the only people that
[03:21:35.940 --> 03:21:41.220]  profits are the military industrial complex as general Dwight D Eisenhower
[03:21:41.220 --> 03:21:46.620]  five-star general supreme commander of the allied forces and two-term president
[03:21:46.620 --> 03:21:55.660]  said his farewell address January 1961 at the military industrial complex was
[03:21:55.660 --> 03:21:59.780]  robbing the nation of the genius of the scientists the sweat of the laborers and
[03:21:59.780 --> 03:22:04.700]  the future of the children so the people say oh there's profit and war that's
[03:22:04.700 --> 03:22:11.580]  nonsense there's only destruction and war is growth and profit and peace so
[03:22:11.580 --> 03:22:22.420]  going back into what Alex was saying about the deal with North Korea and we
[03:22:22.420 --> 03:22:33.740]  have our new guy over there Bolton and he was on the TV yesterday and he said
[03:22:33.740 --> 03:22:41.500]  a question was that is a requirement that Kim Jong-un agree to give away those
[03:22:41.500 --> 03:22:46.420]  weapons meaning the nuclear weapons before you give any kind of concession
[03:22:46.420 --> 03:22:55.040]  and Bolton said I think that's right I think we're looking at Libya model of
[03:22:55.040 --> 03:23:06.900]  2003 and 2004 the Milan bells go off that's why North Korea got nuclear
[03:23:06.900 --> 03:23:14.940]  weapons because they saw what the United States how they backtracked on the
[03:23:14.940 --> 03:23:20.580]  agreement just like by the way the United States government broke every
[03:23:20.580 --> 03:23:27.840]  treaty that it made with the Native Americans they broke the treaty on that
[03:23:27.840 --> 03:23:37.720]  with Libya as well so once he got rid of the nukes by by Qaddafi and that's why
[03:23:37.720 --> 03:23:44.040]  North Korea got these weapons they made it clear from the beginning so if
[03:23:44.040 --> 03:23:52.720]  they're really assured peace that's what they want they're a tiny country the
[03:23:52.720 --> 03:23:58.720]  gross domestic product is about half the size of Western genius they got a
[03:23:58.720 --> 03:24:06.200]  population about the size of Texas that threat to nobody but they are a threat
[03:24:06.200 --> 03:24:12.400]  to the whole region with their nuclear testing and of course last week there
[03:24:12.400 --> 03:24:16.680]  was a report that came out at the place where they did nuclear test the whole
[03:24:16.680 --> 03:24:20.840]  place collapsed under at the laboratories and everything else so China and
[03:24:20.840 --> 03:24:25.680]  Russia don't want these things going off around them so they're all in it for
[03:24:25.680 --> 03:24:31.320]  this and as you well know people that have been listening to me and watching
[03:24:31.320 --> 03:24:35.280]  our trends in the news broadcasts whether they're on YouTube or subscribed
[03:24:35.280 --> 03:24:39.600]  to the trends journal I kept saying from the beginning North Korea is not a
[03:24:39.600 --> 03:24:45.400]  problem if the United States attacks North Korea say goodbye to South Korea
[03:24:45.400 --> 03:24:51.200]  kissing goodbye if DMZ is a couple of miles away from Seoul South Korea with
[03:24:51.200 --> 03:24:57.720]  a metropolitan population of about 26 million people so if you bomb North
[03:24:57.720 --> 03:25:02.480]  Korea say goodbye to South Korea and kiss Japan goodbye so we never saw
[03:25:02.480 --> 03:25:08.400]  anything happening there in terms of militarily we have been saying for over
[03:25:08.400 --> 03:25:18.240]  a year the flashpoint is Iran and I mentioned to what our defense secretary
[03:25:18.240 --> 03:25:25.800]  Matt has said when I was on with Alex before here's some more information I
[03:25:25.800 --> 03:25:33.360]  want to read to you this is from hot ads the Israeli newspaper yesterday
[03:25:33.360 --> 03:25:46.600]  excuse me two days ago this is the defense secretary of Israel Lieberman
[03:25:46.600 --> 03:25:55.440]  Israel has three problems Iran Iran and Iran Iran is trying to destabilize the
[03:25:55.440 --> 03:26:02.880]  whole region not only in Israel look at what's happening in Yebun Lebanon
[03:26:02.880 --> 03:26:13.760]  Iraq and Syria Iran supports and creates proxies around Israel
[03:26:16.640 --> 03:26:23.600]  Hamas and Islamic Jihad would not survive one week without Iranian support
[03:26:23.600 --> 03:26:30.920]  well when you go to the Islamic Jihad you could thank Saudi Arabia for that one
[03:26:30.920 --> 03:26:42.280]  and the United States for supporting them in the overthrow of Qaddafi in Libya
[03:26:42.280 --> 03:26:51.880]  and then them going into Syria again a war began by Saudi Arabia
[03:26:52.400 --> 03:26:59.800]  Yemen Lieberman's talking about look what the Saudis are doing to Yemen with
[03:26:59.800 --> 03:27:03.840]  the help of the United States supplying them the weapons intelligence and air
[03:27:03.840 --> 03:27:11.840]  refueling is the humanitarian crisis at the World Health Organization says is
[03:27:11.840 --> 03:27:20.960]  the worst in the world going on there now so why point fingers that Iran oh and
[03:27:20.960 --> 03:27:28.960]  Hezbollah and how did they come about that's when Israel invaded Lebanon and
[03:27:28.960 --> 03:27:37.080]  they formed the throw Israel out so let's put these things into perspective
[03:27:37.600 --> 03:27:43.720]  we're going down a very dangerous road here not only will the markets crash and
[03:27:43.720 --> 03:27:51.920]  oil prices rise not only will gold skyrocket but this could be the
[03:27:51.920 --> 03:27:59.600]  greatest humanitarian crisis since World War two if it continues to escalate this
[03:27:59.600 --> 03:28:08.240]  isn't going after Iraq or Syria or Libya this is big and I don't want to hear
[03:28:08.240 --> 03:28:30.280]  that bomb drop be back at a couple of minutes and sit you in it

[03:29:17.360 --> 03:29:23.160]  for incredibly delicious water now and in an emergency get to goberkey.com
[03:29:23.160 --> 03:29:34.120]  we're call 877-886-3653 877-886-3653 goberkey.com I was just about to walk
[03:29:34.120 --> 03:29:38.040]  out of the studio to pick my children up and I got some bad news for the second
[03:29:38.040 --> 03:29:42.120]  time in the five and a half year history of survival shield x2 our flagship
[03:29:42.120 --> 03:29:46.680]  product we are having supply chain problems and this may be the last batch
[03:29:46.680 --> 03:29:51.680]  of this we have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns
[03:29:51.680 --> 03:29:56.520]  into purple gas in the atmosphere and so in our own search to get the purest form
[03:29:56.520 --> 03:30:01.680]  we discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that
[03:30:01.680 --> 03:30:05.040]  they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers they used
[03:30:05.040 --> 03:30:08.840]  to make drugs and once they figure out there's a market they start jacking up
[03:30:08.840 --> 03:30:14.840]  the price but we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out hopefully just
[03:30:14.840 --> 03:30:17.680]  like the last time this happened a few years ago it's not an issue and we do
[03:30:17.680 --> 03:30:22.400]  get more but right now we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the
[03:30:22.400 --> 03:30:28.120]  purest iodine in the world but what it does is for Stamina libido focus energy

[03:33:05.120 --> 03:33:14.560]  the war in the Middle East and again this is from last week that having met
[03:33:14.560 --> 03:33:20.920]  with his Israeli counterpart Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman US
[03:33:20.920 --> 03:33:28.760]  Secretary of Defense James Mattis warns he sees in Israeli war with Iran as quote
[03:33:28.760 --> 03:33:42.320]  very likely he cited Iran's presence in Syria as the likely cause of the fight
[03:33:43.600 --> 03:33:54.440]  so Mattis added we hope Iran would pull back rather than risk a rally Israeli
[03:33:54.440 --> 03:34:06.280]  attacks Pompeo says Trump unlikely to stay in Iran deal
[03:34:08.360 --> 03:34:22.240]  and we keep going here this is from the Israeli newspaper this is quoting our
[03:34:22.240 --> 03:34:31.200]  new Secretary of State Pompeo he said that US stands with Israel against Iran we
[03:34:31.200 --> 03:34:36.880]  remain deeply concerned about Iran's dangerous escalation of threats toward

[03:35:24.160 --> 03:35:30.200]  escalation of threats to Israel in the region and Iran's ambition to dominate
[03:35:30.200 --> 03:35:35.640]  the Middle East how dare they try to dominate the Middle East when the United

[03:38:43.920 --> 03:38:53.120]  and Alex mentioned about Iran going off the dollar yeah it's not gonna do
[03:38:53.120 --> 03:38:59.680]  anything it doesn't make much of a difference even all this talk about the
[03:38:59.680 --> 03:39:04.640]  petro you on of course we had the petro dollar that was a deal that was made by
[03:39:04.640 --> 03:39:10.000]  Kissinger and under the Nixon administration will protect the Saudi
[03:39:10.000 --> 03:39:17.240]  gang but here's the deal you got to pay us back all the oil that you sell an
[03:39:17.240 --> 03:39:23.360]  OPEC it got to be priced in dollars cup issue that was the deal to protect the gang
[03:39:23.360 --> 03:39:30.440]  that's all this is over there it's a gang again they invented this group in
[03:39:30.440 --> 03:39:39.320]  1934 named the country after the mob family the Saudis the United States
[03:39:39.320 --> 03:39:46.160]  protected them that was the deal so now we have to put this into perspective the
[03:39:46.160 --> 03:39:50.680]  reserve currency is being used the United States represents of about 60
[03:39:50.680 --> 03:40:00.800]  percent 63 percent then the euro now the euro values going down why because the
[03:40:00.800 --> 03:40:06.560]  economy isn't good that's why they're keeping interest rates at negative
[03:40:06.560 --> 03:40:13.760]  interest rates into next year and keeping their phony bond buying scheme
[03:40:13.760 --> 03:40:21.280]  going they're buying corporate bonds these aren't governments it's fascism the
[03:40:21.280 --> 03:40:25.440]  merger of state and corporate governments they're keeping the big guys afloat
[03:40:25.440 --> 03:40:30.520]  keeping the equity markets going by juicing them with cheap dough now
[03:40:30.520 --> 03:40:37.480]  let's keep going back to Iran pulling away from the dollar rushes selling and
[03:40:37.480 --> 03:40:43.800]  buying its oil in the currencies China with the Petro you on you could buy will

[03:47:40.760 --> 03:47:46.400]  of the things I do is a trend forecaster I go to the world to try to find the
[03:47:46.400 --> 03:47:51.480]  news and look up the information whatever makes sense to me after reading
[03:47:51.480 --> 03:47:57.120]  enough of it and finding enough facts whatever facts are and it can be trusted
[03:47:57.120 --> 03:48:01.520]  I try to make an analysis on them so I don't have an agenda when I'm looking
[03:48:01.520 --> 03:48:10.240]  I'm just looking and searching and one of the agencies I go to for news as far
[03:48:10.240 --> 03:48:16.680]  as news agency which is the Iranian one and here's their report from last night
[03:48:16.680 --> 03:48:25.200]  Syrian army positions come under missile fire attacks in Hamas and Aleppo the
[03:48:25.200 --> 03:48:30.840]  Syrian army positions in Hamas and Aleppo were heavily pounded by missiles on
[03:48:30.840 --> 03:48:38.520]  Sunday night the Damascus-based Sanaa news agency reported now they're
[03:48:38.520 --> 03:48:42.960]  saying some 200 missiles were fired and it was almost earthquakes it was so
[03:48:42.960 --> 03:48:49.720]  shattering no one yet has admitted the responsibility for the attacks but
[03:48:49.720 --> 03:48:55.160]  militant news outlets and social media networks said the US has fired the
[03:48:55.160 --> 03:49:03.480]  missiles from al-Tanf border crossing in eastern Syria some other sources said
[03:49:03.480 --> 03:49:09.560]  the missile attacks were carried out by the US and in response to the Syria's
[03:49:09.560 --> 03:49:15.120]  armies advanced east of the Euphrates against the Kurdish-dominated Syrian
[03:49:15.120 --> 03:49:20.680]  Democratic forces other sources said that Israel that had previously targeted
[03:49:20.680 --> 03:49:25.880]  the T-4 air base in homes province where the Iranian troops had been
[03:49:25.880 --> 03:49:32.560]  stationed has been behind the missile attacks 12 soldiers have been killed and
[03:49:32.560 --> 03:49:40.480]  many more wounded several Iranian advisors and more than a dozen
[03:49:40.480 --> 03:49:47.640]  civilians who live in a village adjacent to the Hamas depot depot had been
[03:49:47.640 --> 03:49:57.120]  killed in the raid okay we could see where this is go it's escalating there's
[03:49:57.120 --> 03:50:05.120]  no advancement of society with more wars what will come out of it is no good
[03:50:05.120 --> 03:50:13.400]  we're in Afghanistan now going on 17 years Iraq since 2003 Libya has been
[03:50:13.400 --> 03:50:24.920]  destroyed it's a hellhole it was the richest nation in Africa so we need peace
[03:50:24.920 --> 03:50:32.440]  and this isn't the way or the path to it there is discrepancy about whether or
[03:50:32.440 --> 03:50:41.200]  not Iran is allowed to test ballistic missiles if they're not carrying nuclear
[03:50:41.200 --> 03:50:45.640]  weapons is designed to do so they are according to the information I've read
[03:50:45.640 --> 03:50:53.240]  from the United Nations allowed to do that according to the reports coming in
[03:50:53.240 --> 03:51:02.360]  according to all of the analysis by the monitoring agencies they have not again
[03:51:02.360 --> 03:51:09.040]  that's according to the agencies have not violated the principles of the deal
[03:51:09.040 --> 03:51:17.480]  that they made cutting back on nuclear development again I think this has more
[03:51:17.480 --> 03:51:22.600]  to do with the decline of Netanyahu the craziness of what's going on in Saudi
[03:51:22.600 --> 03:51:29.160]  Arabia and whatever the United States military industrial complex has to do
[03:51:29.160 --> 03:51:34.960]  with it there's a clip going around about Rand Paul being on with mouse
[03:51:34.960 --> 03:51:42.760]  Blitzer and CNN back in 2016 when Rand Paul came out against the war in Yemen
[03:51:42.760 --> 03:51:51.360]  and mouse said to him in words you could look it up well that'll hurt sales from
[03:51:51.360 --> 03:51:57.240]  arms manufacturers and that will cause a loss of jobs in the United States that's
[03:51:57.240 --> 03:52:03.280]  how sick that clown is so again it's always great to be here and to keep these

[03:52:41.480 --> 03:52:46.680]  again you can't sing any of those songs when I was a young guy standing on the

[03:53:35.480 --> 03:53:38.560]  back to the economy
[03:53:38.560 --> 03:53:48.240]  we're in a period now where we believe the Trump rally has peaked there's
[03:53:48.240 --> 03:53:54.520]  going to continue to be increases but volatility is now the name of the game
[03:53:54.520 --> 03:54:00.760]  again the markets are overvalued and over leveraged with the ETFs on the
[03:54:00.760 --> 03:54:04.800]  over leveraged side is one of them and overvalued by their price earnings
[03:54:04.800 --> 03:54:09.400]  ratio according to people like Schiller who says that they are record is now
[03:54:09.400 --> 03:54:19.440]  that almost compared to the dot-com bust and the crash at 29 and was juicing the
[03:54:19.440 --> 03:54:23.160]  markets of the stock buybacks
[03:54:24.240 --> 03:54:32.040]  we believe that that will keep the markets going the GDP numbers that are
[03:54:32.040 --> 03:54:39.480]  coming in are better but they're not that strong we also heard from Japan last
[03:54:39.480 --> 03:54:47.080]  week the head of the Bank of Japan Karoda said they were going to stay in
[03:54:47.080 --> 03:54:56.840]  negative interest rates and negative bond yields the growth is not there now
[03:54:56.840 --> 03:55:04.400]  let's put it all together again the ECB last week said they're going to keep
[03:55:04.400 --> 03:55:09.520]  interest rates still negative and this is a war on savers by the way we have no
[03:55:09.520 --> 03:55:13.600]  place to put our money but they don't care they want all the money's going to
[03:55:13.600 --> 03:55:21.600]  equity markets so the rich get richer and the story and the bigs get bigger so
[03:55:21.600 --> 03:55:28.440]  as we see what's happening with the markets going up because they're being
[03:55:28.440 --> 03:55:37.520]  juiced we see this as a temporary juice item in the states because of Trump's
[03:55:37.520 --> 03:55:46.320]  omnibus budget that increased the debt level by 1.5 trillion or they should
[03:55:46.320 --> 03:55:53.760]  say that 1.5 trillion omnibus budget now that's gonna juice the economy
[03:55:53.760 --> 03:56:01.400]  however according to the Brookings Institute study and I only could go by
[03:56:01.400 --> 03:56:06.120]  what's out there they say that the average tax saving for an American
[03:56:06.120 --> 03:56:15.840]  middle-class family the Trump plan is the grand total of about 930 bucks they
[03:56:15.840 --> 03:56:21.240]  lost that already with the rise of gas prices just this year if gas prices
[03:56:21.240 --> 03:56:32.320]  keep increasing and if there's war just the economy goodbye is the markets
[03:56:32.320 --> 03:56:39.360]  goodbye again gold prices to rise here's our forecast for gold it has to go over
[03:56:39.360 --> 03:56:46.500]  1385 an ounce once it breaks that the big breakout point is 1450 dollars an
