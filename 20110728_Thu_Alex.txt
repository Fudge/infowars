[00:12.160 --> 00:31.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:31.840 --> 00:35.680]  welcome my friends thank you so much for joining us we're gonna have an
[00:35.680 --> 00:40.960]  absolutely jam-packed broadcast transmission for you today it is
[00:40.960 --> 00:54.320]  Thursday the 28th day of July 2011 now out of the gates I ended up playing the
[00:54.320 --> 00:59.640]  special report in overdrive yesterday so I'm gonna get back into the actual
[00:59.640 --> 01:05.800]  technicals of what I believe is the greatest threat facing humanity and
[01:05.800 --> 01:10.920]  that is unchecked genetic engineering human clones humans being spliced with
[01:10.920 --> 01:17.920]  plants animals insects reptiles amphibians fish it's all being done and
[01:17.920 --> 01:23.840]  it's admitted in plain view now we've learned since the 1960s but more and more
[01:23.840 --> 01:27.560]  they're admitting they've been doing it secretly and I want to break down why
[01:27.560 --> 01:32.400]  this is a threat because I got a few emails and saw a few comments on our
[01:32.400 --> 01:37.040]  special report with people saying what's wrong with technology well what's wrong
[01:37.040 --> 01:40.640]  with a firearm nothing unless a bad person is using it to shoot you in the
[01:40.640 --> 01:45.800]  head and so we have the headline I'm breaking down the proof and the facts of
[01:45.800 --> 01:50.240]  all this information at info wars.com I've moved it back to the top of the
[01:50.240 --> 01:56.720]  page in featured news genetic genocide humanity's greatest threat and the name
[01:56.720 --> 02:02.000]  of the video that accompanies the article is genetic Armageddon

[02:06.640 --> 02:12.040]  American dream report did an accompanying article part human part animal
[02:12.040 --> 02:16.720]  hybrid monsters are being created by scientists all over the planet they go
[02:16.720 --> 02:20.000]  through the proof and that was my intention I asked other journalists
[02:20.000 --> 02:25.800]  reporters filmmakers youtubers to look at this information yourself you'll
[02:25.800 --> 02:29.880]  dig up even more than we've dug up and talk about it get a buzz going about real
[02:29.880 --> 02:35.120]  issues not whether you know the NFL was going to have a striker whatever also

[04:24.000 --> 04:28.800]  the Pentagon and when Congress asked to see the two years of emails they'd been
[04:28.800 --> 04:33.280]  surveilling they were told National Security Congress can't see that but I
[04:33.280 --> 04:37.640]  wanted to dovetail that with Obama to approve Al Qaeda embassy in Washington

[05:22.120 --> 05:26.120]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[05:26.120 --> 05:30.240]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[05:30.240 --> 05:34.200]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[05:34.200 --> 05:38.400]  power from weather-related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[05:38.400 --> 05:41.960]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the
[05:41.960 --> 05:45.240]  solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest

[08:05.360 --> 08:25.480]  because there's a war on for your mind
[08:25.480 --> 08:32.960]  we are live my friends it is Thursday the 28th day of July 2011 and we are
[08:32.960 --> 08:37.600]  tracking the globalist crime syndicate as they continue to roll out new
[08:37.600 --> 08:43.200]  preplanned phases of their global government their private fascistic
[08:43.200 --> 08:50.000]  anti-free market anti-family anti-private property criminal takeover of
[08:50.000 --> 08:55.160]  society their takeover of the genetic engineering of the crops their takeover
[08:55.160 --> 09:02.240]  of every facet of life on this planet what the globalist call full spectrum
[09:02.240 --> 09:08.400]  dominance we are here attempting with some success in growing success which is
[09:08.400 --> 09:16.680]  very exciting to try to activate the warning system the survival instincts
[09:16.680 --> 09:23.080]  that are within all human beings that beat deep within our breast a desire to
[09:23.080 --> 09:29.880]  uplift the species to build to explore to trailblaze and to protect the innocent
[09:29.880 --> 09:36.600]  the children the women the men the people of our planet we are here to bring
[09:36.600 --> 09:43.520]  hope but real hope the only hope is in facing just how serious the crisis is
[09:43.520 --> 09:49.360]  just how criminal and ruthless and psychopathic the globe's current
[09:49.360 --> 09:54.360]  controllers and ruling class are if you studied history you know ruling classes
[09:54.360 --> 09:58.160]  tend to become very decadent especially when they're in power for a long time
[09:58.160 --> 10:02.040]  they have completely eroded the sovereignty of every nation on earth
[10:02.040 --> 10:06.600]  but a handful of third world countries they're now mopping up doesn't mean
[10:06.600 --> 10:10.160]  those third world countries are run by good people in most cases no the point
[10:10.160 --> 10:16.920]  is they are not setting up the global eugenics extermination grid Russia is
[10:16.920 --> 10:23.480]  extremely corrupt with a corrupt old line oligarchy running it but Russia is
[10:23.480 --> 10:29.040]  not financing eugenics for sterilization and population reduction
[10:29.040 --> 10:34.960]  Russia it from my analysis its public information is paying the public to have
[10:34.960 --> 10:40.680]  children so I think that's important to add China made a secret deal in 1975 with
[10:40.680 --> 10:45.560]  US ambassador to China now declassified through State Department
[10:45.560 --> 10:51.320]  memorandums 200 and others George Herbert Walker Bush for China to be the
[10:51.320 --> 10:55.480]  new industrial base and to be at the top of the New World Order after the United
[10:55.480 --> 11:00.920]  States is brought to third world status if they would begin exterminating large
[11:00.920 --> 11:04.720]  portions of their population in the womb and even after they're born with the
[11:04.720 --> 11:10.040]  dreaded one-child policy now of course public all right I am now digressing
[11:10.040 --> 11:15.120]  ladies and gentlemen let me give you the news that we have in front of us today
[11:15.120 --> 11:23.720]  this story is of the utmost importance by Kurt Nemo it is posted on info wars
[11:23.720 --> 11:31.200]  dot-com and prison planet dot-com and we need everyone to get this report out to
[11:31.200 --> 11:37.200]  their email list to their friends to their families
[11:37.200 --> 11:47.280]  busting posse common taught us military cops arrests civilians in Florida city
[11:47.280 --> 11:52.960]  now I've read Kurt Nemo's article it's excellent it has scores of links to other
[11:52.960 --> 11:56.760]  examples of this happening but it's so much worse than you can even put in an
[11:56.760 --> 12:02.400]  article so before I read the article let me just break something down two years
[12:02.400 --> 12:08.280]  ago all over California our Marines from the bases began setting up checkpoints
[12:08.280 --> 12:13.680]  in multiple counties with firearms on their side searching citizens cars and
[12:13.680 --> 12:18.480]  doing breathalyzer test completely illegal in your face and it was in a
[12:18.480 --> 12:22.280]  chips press release is the only reason we know about it and the Marines
[12:22.280 --> 12:25.920]  defended it and got very arrogant when we tried to call them and get them on as
[12:25.920 --> 12:29.360]  guest and basically laughed at us and said look we're taking over that's the
[12:29.360 --> 12:34.800]  end of it shut up two years ago and it's continued in a four state area
[12:34.800 --> 12:41.440]  centering around Tennessee regular Army Army Reserve regular Air Force Air
[12:41.440 --> 12:52.320]  Force Reserve MPs from all branches Marines ATF FBI DEA TSA Viper teams
[12:52.320 --> 12:57.520]  federal marshals for more than 20 agencies set up checkpoints shutting
[12:57.520 --> 13:02.720]  down major highways searching families trucks you name it when the governor
[13:02.720 --> 13:07.680]  said you didn't ask me to do this get out they said presidential decision
[13:07.680 --> 13:15.080]  directive 50 and they also cited the John Warner Defense Authorization Act and
[13:15.080 --> 13:19.440]  that's all covered my film police state for the rise of FEMA absolutely seminal
[13:19.440 --> 13:23.920]  to give you a full spectrum I just got chills just thinking about that film and
[13:23.920 --> 13:31.080]  what we've proven full spectrum takeover please listen to me there's been
[13:31.080 --> 13:36.760]  covert operations that have come out I remember in 1998 in the Pensacola news
[13:36.760 --> 13:41.280]  journal we have copies of it still on info wars.com actual scans of the
[13:41.280 --> 13:46.600]  newspaper the Marine Corps training facility with Marines in their cadets
[13:46.600 --> 13:53.200]  the trainees entered Hobbs Middle School for over five hours lining the
[13:53.200 --> 13:57.360]  children up at machine gun points screaming this is Marshall law Marshall
[13:57.360 --> 14:04.040]  law will come to America Bill Clinton this is a quote Bill Clinton wants you
[14:04.040 --> 14:12.520]  to know what Marshall law is like that was in the newspaper I covered it by
[14:12.520 --> 14:15.440]  then my show had become syndicated on a few stations and on shortwave and
[14:15.440 --> 14:19.920]  satellite and the paper came out said well they did say all those things but
[14:19.920 --> 14:25.640]  still Alex Jones is bad for scaring Pensacola all on record now remember as
[14:25.640 --> 14:31.840]  I talked to you there are hundreds of cases I have confirmed I interviewed a
[14:31.840 --> 14:37.520]  Marine Corps captain who got out of the Marines after a decade and who started a
[14:37.520 --> 14:41.800]  computer company I went to his mansion and interviewed him there and he's in
[14:41.800 --> 14:45.880]  road to tyranny 911 road to tyranny why did he sit down for the interview and
[14:45.880 --> 14:50.320]  show me photos and documents he said I knew it was wrong when I did it but now
[14:50.320 --> 14:55.400]  I understand why we did it and he said I was stopped at a Army checkpoint in
[14:55.400 --> 14:59.440]  Kyle Texas and they've had a bunch of them and he said these are totally
[14:59.440 --> 15:06.240]  illegal I'm gonna spill my guts and he rated gun shops for small gun
[15:06.240 --> 15:16.680]  infractions go oh you didn't fill out the form right in the late 1980s in beta
[15:16.680 --> 15:21.440]  testing then they created larger teams he rated gun shops I said oh you rated
[15:21.440 --> 15:26.880]  drug dealers he said no gun shops and gun dealers homes
[15:27.560 --> 15:33.520]  US Marines and he went along with it so he then you know traveled up the you know
[15:33.520 --> 15:38.800]  the command structure and then he became a police officer for a while but he
[15:38.800 --> 15:41.320]  also did got a degree in computer programming went made a bunch of money
[15:41.320 --> 15:43.960]  doing that he showed me all his police stuff and the rest of his a police
[15:43.960 --> 15:50.600]  officer in Florida but the point is is that he is in 911 the road to tyranny
[15:50.600 --> 15:55.560]  it's a two and a half hour film it's in the last 30 minutes go watch it in the
[15:55.560 --> 16:04.280]  1980s they had secret teams of Marines in police blue windbreaker jackets that
[16:04.280 --> 16:10.480]  was their uniform with police rating gun dealers you know just coming into the
[16:10.480 --> 16:17.320]  family gun shop and with the ATF and local police and having Marines there I've
[16:17.320 --> 16:20.200]  been to the urban warfare drills were they trying to take your guns two years
[16:20.200 --> 16:24.240]  ago also in road to tyranny became a national news story it was in the
[16:24.240 --> 16:29.280]  Arcadia Iowa newspaper it said the local gun shop is practicing being rated and
[16:29.280 --> 16:34.240]  the town of what was it 700 they said will be shut down and everyone has
[16:34.240 --> 16:39.120]  agreed in the town to have Marines know his army I interviewed the colonel we
[16:39.120 --> 16:44.600]  got the colonel on about it to have the army go door-to-door and practice gun
[16:44.600 --> 16:55.560]  confiscation in the homes now just as in the case just as in the case of other
[16:55.560 --> 17:01.400]  events around the country that we've covered like Pensacola after they do
[17:01.400 --> 17:06.040]  this and we make a big stink the paper attacked us and said we were crazy sure
[17:06.040 --> 17:11.160]  it was true they were doing this but it was for Iraq yeah I've been to the
[17:11.160 --> 17:18.000]  urban warfare drills in one of the more famous was in Oakland over a thousand
[17:18.000 --> 17:26.960]  Marines Israeli troops French Dutch Czech Republic Australian hundreds of
[17:26.960 --> 17:32.920]  role-players screaming I'm an American please not the camp they led us into a
[17:32.920 --> 17:38.200]  media guided tour they shut down a university to do it and they would never
[17:38.200 --> 17:42.920]  let us go into the actual drill areas very close and they wouldn't the the
[17:42.920 --> 17:47.320]  the former Marine it was the civilian spokesman last name was Jones he's in
[17:47.320 --> 17:51.960]  the film his first name you'll see him say no you can't film this well we got
[17:51.960 --> 17:56.120]  around the bureaucracy they were also giving citizens tours so we just checked
[17:56.120 --> 18:04.480]  out and stopped saying that we were media and just reinserted ourselves as as
[18:04.480 --> 18:11.960]  citizens wanting to videotape as citizen tours and they let us film okay
[18:11.960 --> 18:14.480]  they bring the Americans out of the house they put them on their knees they
[18:14.480 --> 18:19.480]  go all right watch this execution and simulate killing Americans they simulate
[18:19.480 --> 18:23.200]  and they do it in Afghanistan it's admitted they just killed the the
[18:23.200 --> 18:27.440]  prisoners they do white washes where they release oh they accidentally shot

[18:30.800 --> 18:34.320]  a whitewash they have admitted they wiped out entire villages to the point is
[18:34.320 --> 18:39.000]  they bring the American militia people out and they set them down on their knees

[18:53.200 --> 19:00.320]  people this is going on and the issue here is they've set up brigade homeland

[24:22.280 --> 24:29.040]  I'm begging you to listen to very carefully to me I have been to urban
[24:29.040 --> 24:33.560]  warfare drills all over the country I have sent my film crews all over the
[24:33.560 --> 24:41.080]  country just last year I sent Rob do and cohorts up to Illinois and we even got
[24:41.080 --> 24:47.840]  from one of our local radio affiliates full media passes they trained to put the
[24:47.840 --> 24:53.680]  citizens of Illinois in the sports stadium they use Boy Scouts and girls as
[24:53.680 --> 25:02.120]  the citizens to be put in the camps they did gun confiscation drills okay I have
[25:02.120 --> 25:07.040]  footage from Hebron, Maryland where they march up to the camera people who live
[25:07.040 --> 25:11.760]  there and say you're not allowed to videotape and then they threaten to
[25:11.760 --> 25:17.840]  arrest them Marines with guns we later learned and it's on tape in police state
[25:17.840 --> 25:25.000]  2000 that's been out for 12 years came out in 99 we then learned it was Boy
[25:25.000 --> 25:31.120]  Scouts running around going in their parents home this is on record and the
[25:31.120 --> 25:35.240]  police chief defends it and coming back and telling the Marines what guns they
[25:35.240 --> 25:41.640]  have when the by the way when I was in California in 1999 covering urban
[25:41.640 --> 25:46.440]  warfare I got back to the hotel there in Oakland at 10 o'clock at night turned
[25:46.440 --> 25:49.680]  on CNN and they'd been there that day and they were saying the troops are
[25:49.680 --> 25:56.720]  training for Macedonian operations in the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis and sure
[25:56.720 --> 26:00.920]  every bit of training they do is dual use but that was deceptive it was all
[26:00.920 --> 26:05.000]  America America America so I knew they were really training for this in
[26:05.000 --> 26:09.680]  America that it was illegal violation of federal law common sense everybody knows
[26:09.680 --> 26:13.200]  it's the military in Nazi Germany that takes over it's the military that takes
[26:13.200 --> 26:19.040]  over in Guatemala it's the military that takes over in all of these places it's
[26:19.040 --> 26:23.800]  the military took over in Rome with Julius Caesar it's always the threat that
[26:23.800 --> 26:28.520]  you get bad government that commands the military against the people but it's so
[26:28.520 --> 26:34.720]  diametrically opposed to the American system and law that quietly quietly
[26:34.720 --> 26:41.680]  since the mid-1980s they have been creating cadres testing troops seeing
[26:41.680 --> 26:45.160]  if they'll do it and here's what's scary they've now announced it two years ago
[26:45.160 --> 26:49.600]  that yeah troops are gonna be on the streets for economic collapse or terror
[26:49.600 --> 26:56.040]  attack and you learn then from the Rand corporation documents in 99 that I
[26:56.040 --> 26:58.760]  learned about because they were in the Austin American statesman that they've
[26:58.760 --> 27:01.960]  written the plan to militarize police the threat fusion centers that are really
[27:01.960 --> 27:06.240]  spy systems under federal merger most of them being put in old military bases
[27:06.240 --> 27:13.560]  under military control I mean this is so hellish what we're facing and now they
[27:13.560 --> 27:16.800]  just roll it out yeah there's troops the Kentucky Derby we don't have the state
[27:16.800 --> 27:20.760]  police run out when folks you know as is tradition right on the field we have
[27:20.760 --> 27:24.800]  army run out with guns and pull them every year it's done on purpose as a
[27:24.800 --> 27:30.560]  beta test the Super Bowl it's all about conditioning conditioning the TSA but
[27:30.560 --> 27:34.880]  the military is gonna back up the TSA on the streets as I told you nine years
[27:34.880 --> 27:39.440]  ago saw Governor Regiment the whole plan fit into the overall strategy they've
[27:39.440 --> 27:47.160]  had now they just admit it to you now here's the issue people 15 years ago we
[27:47.160 --> 27:50.520]  talked about this 12 years ago we talked about they say well why would the army
[27:50.520 --> 27:54.520]  want to take over they want to protect America they want us to make money you
[27:54.520 --> 27:58.800]  know America's good the don't say my son who's in the army's bad not saying
[27:58.800 --> 28:05.640]  your son who's in the army's bad they got rid of the laws 15 years ago and then
[28:05.640 --> 28:10.400]  again 12 years ago to where foreign banks could do whatever they wanted and
[28:10.400 --> 28:14.400]  create any amount of counterfeit financial instruments and sell them to
[28:14.400 --> 28:19.280]  states counties pension funds sell them to the federal government and now that
[28:19.280 --> 28:22.800]  they failed not only are we out the money from the investments they say oh
[28:22.800 --> 28:26.720]  well the whole financial system will be brought down if you don't promise to
[28:26.720 --> 28:31.760]  prop up the 1.5 quadrillion globally 600 plus trill that the Washington post
[28:31.760 --> 28:36.320]  says it's what the USO's now this is like if I go to Las Vegas and run up a
[28:36.320 --> 28:39.920]  $2 million gambling debt and I come knock on your door and say by the way
[28:39.920 --> 28:45.160]  Mr. Johnson or Mrs. Smith you owe this for me if you don't the economy will
[28:45.160 --> 28:48.480]  collapse you'd be like get out of here you nutcase shouldn't have gone and
[28:48.480 --> 28:53.840]  blown the money in Las Vegas but see these banks maneuvered us into this by
[28:53.840 --> 28:57.160]  design they've done this in countless third-world countries they've done this
[28:57.160 --> 29:01.600]  in first-world countries and so they started fever pitch getting the
[29:01.600 --> 29:05.640]  military ready federalizing the police ahead of this and the cops and
[29:05.640 --> 29:08.800]  military that carry this out they're gonna have their pay cut their pension
[29:08.800 --> 29:13.120]  funds stolen they're already all over the country telling police well if when
[29:13.120 --> 29:17.720]  things go bankrupt you're gonna have to give up half your pension fund but it
[29:17.720 --> 29:20.960]  doesn't matter because they're there they're psychologically profiling and
[29:20.960 --> 29:26.560]  testing with these long 600 question psychological profile test they're
[29:26.560 --> 29:32.480]  finding kind of Dudley do-right kind of wimp good guy people like they they're
[29:32.480 --> 29:35.400]  real dumb they think they're good guys they believe whatever the higher-ups
[29:35.400 --> 29:40.240]  tell them like dogs and they're kind of hiring these you know these wimp tough
[29:40.240 --> 29:43.480]  guy types to use them against the American people they don't by the way
[29:43.480 --> 29:47.840]  they don't hire high intelligence crafty soldiers they hire low IQ morons

[33:08.080 --> 33:15.400]  Alex Jones okay I'm gonna open the phones up for the first five or ten
[33:15.400 --> 33:20.920]  callers or so only for military and police that are listening it's still a
[33:20.920 --> 33:25.320]  free country you're allowed to call in here and talk about things that are
[33:25.320 --> 33:30.680]  illegal and expose them we are not in a total secret police state yet unless we
[33:30.680 --> 33:35.080]  give into it and I have hundreds of news articles where they admit the army the
[33:35.080 --> 33:39.840]  Marine Corps they're running checkpoints all over the country arresting US
[33:39.840 --> 33:43.760]  citizens and I've played the newscast here over and over again that Fox
[33:43.760 --> 33:49.200]  news piece out of upstate New York where oh the army arrested 2,000 people and it
[33:49.200 --> 33:53.440]  shows families being driven under high-powered x-ray machines shooting
[33:53.440 --> 33:59.000]  through the car just a few years before you know the border patrol are in lead
[33:59.000 --> 34:02.560]  shielded facilities to do this the people are made to get out of the car and
[34:02.560 --> 34:08.680]  it's sent over rollers but see I'll let the army grunts die we test chemicals
[34:08.680 --> 34:13.200]  biologicals on them we've stolen their death benefits we're always cheating them
[34:13.200 --> 34:16.760]  by the time they figure it out it'll be too late and the really dumb ones will
[34:16.760 --> 34:21.320]  just hire them and make them police officers I mean that is the policy and
[34:21.320 --> 34:25.520]  so they just got the military on the Fox news piece in fact I'm gonna have Paul
[34:25.520 --> 34:29.200]  Watson because he's one that wrote it add that article to Kurtz articles you
[34:29.200 --> 34:33.480]  can see it I forget the exact headline in fact we just get me Watson online
[34:33.480 --> 34:38.960]  please thank you thank you very much because I want I mean that won't even
[34:38.960 --> 34:44.400]  add any in 110s of the proof here but in Kurtz got dozens of examples but I want
[34:44.400 --> 34:48.120]  folks to see this I mean they think you're complete idiots they got the
[34:48.120 --> 34:52.000]  trips out they're going yeah we catch drugs and guns out here in the middle
[34:52.000 --> 34:58.520]  of nowhere shows families driving under the x-ray scanners and there they are
[34:58.520 --> 35:01.640]  just being blasted with the radiation I mean you think it's bad for the family
[35:01.640 --> 35:05.040]  to drive under a high-powered x-ray that makes a chest x-ray look like mother's
[35:05.040 --> 35:10.040]  milk imagine being those trips and it turns out for seven years or more I
[35:10.040 --> 35:13.480]  guess eight they've known at Boston Logan and four other airports that were
[35:13.480 --> 35:18.120]  testing body scanners that it's massively increasing the levels of cancer and
[35:18.120 --> 35:22.840]  when those agents get sick they just say go home and die pal just like other
[35:22.840 --> 35:27.760]  still blocking health care for the 9-11 responders saying oh you're not getting
[35:27.760 --> 35:32.520]  cancer from this doesn't matter every major institutions that studied it and
[35:32.520 --> 35:36.760]  looked at it says they are dying at you know the number of cancers in some cases
[35:36.760 --> 35:42.120]  are tenfold their lungs are full of assbestos the cats can show it they just
[35:42.120 --> 35:47.320]  say in fact I saw it on Fox News no link to the first responders in cancer remember
[35:47.320 --> 35:51.160]  New York Post attacking first responders last year when they were very close to
[35:51.160 --> 35:54.960]  getting congressional law passed to finally get health care and they said
[35:54.960 --> 35:58.680]  oh they're just a bunch of rip-off artists these cops and military and medics
[35:58.680 --> 36:03.720]  remember the New York Post they're just a bunch of money grubbers yeah I've seen
[36:03.720 --> 36:07.720]  the CAT scans even on the mainstream news their lungs full of it remember they
[36:07.720 --> 36:10.720]  told you the air was safe to breathe turned out they knew it wasn't safe but
[36:10.720 --> 36:17.040]  they got to keep that cover up going yeah they really care about you they really
[36:17.040 --> 36:20.720]  care about you over there at news core absolutely sickening so remember that
[36:20.720 --> 36:25.200]  police and military but it doesn't matter the types of people and this was only
[36:25.200 --> 36:30.120]  going on the last 15 years previous to that police departments would try to
[36:30.120 --> 36:34.720]  hire smart tough guys they go check up on you if you were from the
[36:34.720 --> 36:38.760]  neighborhoods you get in fights when you were a kid were you a tough guy
[36:38.760 --> 36:44.520]  unofficial manuals even got written on it did you like to go after bullies you
[36:44.520 --> 36:49.280]  know do you were you basically like a hunter of corruption that's what good
[36:49.280 --> 36:53.400]  old-fashioned police departments wanted now they want below hundred IQs the
[36:53.400 --> 36:58.560]  lower the better people who will follow whatever orders you give them I remember
[36:58.560 --> 37:02.760]  state police ten years ago in Texas on average seemed a lot smarter man I've
[37:02.760 --> 37:06.640]  run into him now and you talked to him and I mean they seem like they'd have
[37:06.640 --> 37:11.200]  trouble tying the shoelaces and we published internal DPS memorandum
[37:11.200 --> 37:14.720]  yesterday about we are trying to basically only recruit former military
[37:14.720 --> 37:19.400]  right now but by former military they mean specifically the types that really
[37:19.400 --> 37:23.920]  haven't seen combat they've just been through drill camp and learned how to
[37:23.920 --> 37:28.840]  submit and been brainwashed and then not see any combat and been in resupply who
[37:28.840 --> 37:32.360]  now want to wage war against the American people you know you and your wife
[37:32.360 --> 37:37.640]  when they pull you over so that's the model going on here and so let me
[37:37.640 --> 37:41.440]  explain it criminals took over America the big banks that run the narcotics
[37:41.440 --> 37:45.720]  publicly run by the government that ships the guns to the drug gangs in the
[37:45.720 --> 37:51.080]  U.S. and outside the U.S. to control the drug trade they need really dumb cops who
[37:51.080 --> 37:53.800]  can just go write tickets and don't understand this and they're listing
[37:53.800 --> 37:58.200]  right now some of them they're like what the government deals the drugs but then
[37:58.200 --> 38:02.800]  I arrest people for drugs you arrest low-level users who are then put in
[38:02.800 --> 38:08.240]  private prisons publicly owned by big banks that launder the drug money who
[38:08.240 --> 38:11.920]  then work for 25 cents an hour so they make money on both ends of it and I
[38:11.920 --> 38:15.920]  know you don't understand that you barely know how to put your pants on put
[38:15.920 --> 38:19.800]  your belt buckle on I understand that that's why you were chosen for the job
[38:19.800 --> 38:24.400]  now cops that slip through or older police officers they know what's going
[38:24.400 --> 38:29.440]  on by the way I learned all this from police in the last 15 years you know
[38:29.440 --> 38:33.760]  getting to know Dallas detectives Austin detectives LAPD detectives getting to
[38:33.760 --> 38:39.520]  know these people over the years I mean it's a running joke a running joke I
[38:39.520 --> 38:44.680]  mean I have been in the New York subway and gone up and talked to U.S. Army that's
[38:44.680 --> 38:48.360]  there we even got it on video but I felt so sorry for these guys I didn't put it
[38:48.360 --> 38:53.480]  out and I'm like hi what are you doing I'll put that the new phone and I went
[38:53.480 --> 38:58.160]  you are and I believe the person had an extra chromosome and I'm not putting
[38:58.160 --> 39:01.600]  people down to have that it's very sad but I believe they're actually recruiting
[39:01.600 --> 39:06.560]  mentally retarded people I mean and I was I was like you are in the army I am
[39:06.560 --> 39:11.680]  and then I also have footage I did use from that same trip where we're down by
[39:11.680 --> 39:18.200]  Times Square there's U.S. Army running around with 45s on their hips and they
[39:18.200 --> 39:23.360]  see us taping them across the street and the U.S. Army runs over and begins
[39:23.360 --> 39:27.760]  screaming and cussing that they're gonna kick my butt if I don't stop taping and
[39:27.760 --> 39:32.680]  I said do it do it you know how what that would do for the Republic if you
[39:32.680 --> 39:37.320]  beat me to death right there you cowards all to just submit it while you just
[39:37.320 --> 39:41.680]  split my skull through and murdered me that's what will rise the Republic to
[39:41.680 --> 39:47.800]  your evil strike me down I'll become more powerful than you could possibly
[39:47.800 --> 39:52.040]  imagine and that's why the controllers haven't killed me yet they know it you
[39:52.040 --> 39:57.320]  think I want to die no I love life so much I'm willing to die and some of you
[39:57.320 --> 40:03.280]  haven't figured that out yet now I'm sorry I just go back to that point it's in
[40:03.280 --> 40:10.960]  what road to tyranny or is it in is it an end game it's an end game we ought to
[40:10.960 --> 40:14.000]  cue that up later I know Aaron was up here late last night but if he's here
[40:14.000 --> 40:17.720]  usually gets in by now to get him to find that clip people won't believe it
[40:17.720 --> 40:22.240]  I'm tired of it and you know what happened when I rose up to like six or
[40:22.240 --> 40:25.480]  seven military people by the way these weren't dumb people these were gang
[40:25.480 --> 40:29.880]  bangers again they're hiring people who barely can tie their shoelaces from the
[40:29.880 --> 40:34.040]  cornfields and they're hiring gang bangers and these guys were gang bangers
[40:34.040 --> 40:39.480]  they got the 45 on rolling and then you know what obviously racist the way they
[40:39.480 --> 40:43.240]  acted whiteies across the street taping them that isn't gonna happen in America
[40:43.240 --> 40:46.320]  and they came over and they let me I said you know what go ahead and do
[40:46.320 --> 40:52.240]  whatever you're gonna do so this is the situation that we've gotten in this
[40:52.240 --> 40:58.040]  Republic and the government is gonna turn all these people loose on you you
[40:58.040 --> 41:02.840]  know where the biggest army Navy Marine Corps recruiting station is in the world
[41:02.840 --> 41:11.520]  pull it up Mexico City oh yeah nationalistic anti-us get up here the
[41:11.520 --> 41:16.200]  biggest cohorts now in the entire military illegal aliens legalize the
[41:16.200 --> 41:19.000]  minute they sign the dotted line and they will come into your house and they
[41:19.000 --> 41:22.800]  will take your guns and they will ask for seconds in a minute and they're
[41:22.800 --> 41:30.120]  ready to fight so by the way you think I'm joking I can play you front line
[41:30.120 --> 41:33.520]  where it shows a bunch of gang member types and his family's got some fire
[41:33.520 --> 41:36.960]  wood in their car they get up a field and they shoot the car and they shoot
[41:36.960 --> 41:42.560]  the car up laughing they shoot the car up laughing and then running Abrams tank
[41:42.560 --> 41:46.760]  over it back and forth laughing okay that's what's being turned loose on
[41:46.760 --> 41:50.080]  America and I'm gonna get into this new information here in a moment but I want
[41:50.080 --> 41:53.320]  to hear from the military and police if I'm wrong you call in and tell me I'm
[41:53.320 --> 41:56.400]  wrong if I'm right you've been to these urban warfare drills to confiscate the
[41:56.400 --> 42:01.200]  guns you call in here and I want to ask you a question right now okay did you
[42:01.200 --> 42:05.560]  think there wouldn't be a response from the Republic we may be fat dumb and
[42:05.560 --> 42:10.760]  happy in this country but there's still a shadow of the spirit of 1776 the spirit
[42:10.760 --> 42:16.680]  of 1776 is alive and well and it's in my heart it runs through my veins it burns
[42:16.680 --> 42:20.920]  in my mind and it burns in your mind the minute you decide to break your
[42:20.920 --> 42:26.280]  conditioning and join the Republic it's 1776 worldwide against the spirit of
[42:26.280 --> 42:31.800]  1984 it's that simple this country's been taken over by banks they set up a
[42:31.800 --> 42:35.440]  military takeover system so the criminals can get away with it and we've
[42:35.440 --> 42:38.400]  got to get the word out to the military and the police now and we got a
[42:38.400 --> 42:43.520]  straight talk right to them so they realize what we're doing with air now
[42:43.520 --> 42:47.120]  I want to go to Paul Watson Paul Watson joining us from the UK where they've had
[42:47.120 --> 42:51.240]  foreign troops run checkpoints in Scotland and England pulling families
[42:51.240 --> 42:56.240]  out of cars BBC it's the same everywhere foreign troops publicly they admit in a
[42:56.240 --> 42:59.160]  bunch of mainstream news that they're gonna use foreign troops in America
[42:59.160 --> 43:05.440]  during an emergency that's AFP AP Toronto Star we need a master article Watson
[43:05.440 --> 43:10.200]  next week or something a full spectrum article in with different sections how
[43:10.200 --> 43:13.000]  they're conditioning you for military on the streets how they're violating
[43:13.000 --> 43:16.720]  posse commentatus you know Marine Corps out on the streets at a shooting in
[43:16.720 --> 43:21.160]  Alabama the list goes on and on DUI checkpoints we need an example of the
[43:21.160 --> 43:24.200]  foreign troop admissions with all the mainstream articles with foreign troops
[43:24.200 --> 43:29.240]  training in LE09 the rest of it for domestic we need an example historically
[43:29.240 --> 43:32.120]  of what this means and then why they're doing it because of the banking
[43:32.120 --> 43:38.720]  implosion Paul Watson okay we got him on video Skype but he can't hear us let's
[43:38.720 --> 43:44.840]  get hello okay Watson good to have you here with us good to be here okay Watson
[43:44.840 --> 43:49.560]  I'm obviously ranting here because time is getting short we're coming down to the
[43:49.560 --> 43:54.680]  wire here you know in the 2008 they announced by 2011 brigade homeland would
[43:54.680 --> 43:58.960]  be on the streets of America the reports are pouring in now a full military
[43:58.960 --> 44:04.840]  occupation San Antonio MPs out arresting US citizens that's confirmed Florida it's
[44:04.840 --> 44:09.760]  happening was it you were Kurt wrote that article last year where the Marines
[44:09.760 --> 44:14.880]  said they're the army arrested 2000 in New York at x-ray checkpoints on the
[44:14.880 --> 44:20.880]  highways I don't remember it so it's probably Kerr that wrote that one but
[44:20.880 --> 44:24.960]  we've got to dig this stuff up and add it to his latest article have you seen
[44:24.960 --> 44:29.160]  the article obviously you have busting posse common taught us military cops
[44:29.160 --> 44:35.600]  arrest civilians in Florida City I've seen it yeah but I think Kurt wrote that
[44:35.600 --> 44:41.080]  one I know there's military training exercises going on in Boston at the
[44:41.080 --> 44:46.400]  moment they're gonna run into August 5th but more than that these aren't
[44:46.400 --> 44:49.760]  exercises these are arrests being made so we need to I guess I need to get with
[44:49.760 --> 44:54.560]  Kurt and add examples of the different things that have been going on
[44:54.560 --> 44:59.760]  here at homestead airbase we have the crime stop hotline that allows anyone
[44:59.760 --> 45:03.440]  either on base or off insulation to anonymously report a crime okay we're
[45:03.440 --> 45:07.120]  reporting that the terrorists train at US military bases explains the homestead
[45:07.120 --> 45:10.520]  airbase website if you know of a crime that has been committed if you see a
[45:10.520 --> 45:15.160]  crime in progress or if you see a suspicious person vehicle or situation
[45:15.160 --> 45:19.360]  that makes you feel a crime may be occurring call the security force crime
[45:19.360 --> 45:25.920]  stop headline and then it goes on to report that the military is now arresting
[45:25.920 --> 45:30.520]  people at circle K's off base and basically running checkpoints and they've
[45:30.520 --> 45:34.520]  got the photo here we'll put this up on screen from info wars.com of the police
[45:34.520 --> 45:38.520]  posing with the military what do you make of this Watson
[45:38.520 --> 45:44.080]  well it's par for the course isn't it just send me an article massive
[45:44.080 --> 45:48.560]  checkpoint operation in Tennessee violated posse common taught us fourth
[45:48.560 --> 45:55.640]  amendment that was in Tennessee back in 2009 so I mean you went to the urban
[45:55.640 --> 46:00.720]  warfare warfare drills what was it in the late 90s mid to late 90s and that's
[46:00.720 --> 46:04.360]  what they were practicing so now it's coming to fruition and there's that
[46:04.360 --> 46:08.920]  there's exercises going on in Boston at the moment by the way these exercises go
[46:08.920 --> 46:13.960]  live videotaped at exercises on real highways where the Marines that's in
[46:13.960 --> 46:19.360]  police state 2000 as well start arresting citizens we've got links in the
[46:19.360 --> 46:24.400]  article now I remember the actual headline it was a National Guard arrested
[46:24.400 --> 46:31.400]  2000 citizens 2000 civilians in New York Fox News that's pretty much the
[46:31.400 --> 46:35.760]  headline but I want to I want to show folks this who were in denial Watson I
[46:35.760 --> 46:39.800]  got you online you know just basically saying that I want to really get start
[46:39.800 --> 46:43.400]  focusing on this because a couple days ago I sent you that RT news piece that's
[46:43.400 --> 46:48.720]  gotten some more attention from two years ago or 2008 three years ago where
[46:48.720 --> 46:53.240]  they talk about 20,000 US troops on the streets for economic collapse and you're
[46:53.240 --> 46:57.160]  like Alex in the I am back you said this is old the point is they talked about it
[46:57.160 --> 47:02.360]  being in place by 2011 right on time to fully collapse the economy the point is
[47:02.360 --> 47:07.720]  this has all been orchestrated Watson yeah I haven't read anything about it
[47:07.720 --> 47:12.720]  Alex so I have to look into it to see what's going on but the Nemo posted the
[47:12.720 --> 47:18.240]  article this morning about Florida so maybe it's worth talking to Nemo what
[47:18.240 --> 47:24.800]  else are you working on today I know you follow a lot of reports well the record
[47:24.800 --> 47:29.720]  number of Americans have basically lost faith in Obama and this is important
[47:29.720 --> 47:35.640]  because this debt crisis seems to have virtually guaranteed is 2012 election
[47:35.640 --> 47:39.640]  defeat because the number of Americans that believe the country's heading in
[47:39.640 --> 47:45.400]  the right direction two weeks ago was 21 percent now it's 17 percent that's a
[47:45.400 --> 47:51.480]  record low and you've got 75 percent three-quarters of Americans who think
[47:51.480 --> 47:55.640]  the country's on the wrong track and of course this dovetails with the polls we
[47:55.640 --> 48:00.800]  had earlier in the week saying that a generic candidate versus Obama would
[48:00.800 --> 48:08.240]  beat him for what was it 48 percent to 42 so I mean he's completely had it in
[48:08.240 --> 48:13.400]  terms of 2012 the corporate brand Obama that they created two and a half years
[48:13.400 --> 48:18.360]  ago has already run its course and even you even have a 58 percent of
[48:18.360 --> 48:22.640]  Democrats think the country's heading in the wrong direction so he's lost his base
[48:22.640 --> 48:27.960]  as well and I mean that's obviously come about it's intensified as a result of
[48:27.960 --> 48:32.120]  this debt crisis you know what the White House advisors are saying terror attack
[48:32.120 --> 48:38.480]  is the thing that will help Lord Obama well yeah numerous White House
[48:38.480 --> 48:42.120]  advisors former Clinton advisors have said that the only thing that's gonna
[48:42.120 --> 48:47.240]  reverse his fortunes is an old KC style attack something similar to the Norway
[48:47.240 --> 48:53.320]  massacre last week but I mean as you get closer to 2012 that becomes an
[48:53.320 --> 48:57.760]  increasing possibility if they do resort to that kind of false flag because it's
[48:57.760 --> 49:01.640]  the only thing that's gonna save Obama now his credibility is completely shot
[49:01.640 --> 49:07.440]  the Libya thing is out of control now they're talking about approving an
[49:07.440 --> 49:13.200]  embassy for the Libyan rebels on US soil in Washington we've already had Britain
[49:13.200 --> 49:18.640]  say they're gonna unfreeze $150 million and give it straight to the Libyan
[49:18.640 --> 49:23.240]  rebels Britain has now recognized them as the official government of Libya even
[49:23.240 --> 49:27.320]  though they don't control they control less of the country now than they did
[49:27.320 --> 49:31.840]  before the bombardment started and they admittedly call them al-Qaeda and we're
[49:31.840 --> 49:34.960]  gonna get beginning to that coming up with Richard Mack later but then
[49:34.960 --> 49:38.760]  meanwhile they're hyperventilating over the quote Muslim groups hanging up
[49:38.760 --> 49:44.280]  Sharia law signs and if these groups are admitted and we have the
[49:44.280 --> 49:48.480]  documentation of that posted above the article are admitted in my five and my
[49:48.480 --> 49:52.480]  six and it's all staged I mean they have guys clownishly we know with
[49:52.480 --> 49:57.280]  beards and turbines it's they can barely stop from laughing running around
[49:57.280 --> 50:00.600]  saying ridiculous things so the government can take all of Britain's
[50:00.600 --> 50:05.360]  rights the name of fighting the Muslim quote menace oh yeah they said the
[50:05.360 --> 50:10.080]  Muslims against crusades against up against the EDL English defense league
[50:10.080 --> 50:16.000]  both organizations are completely infiltrated and run by MI5 the EDL is
[50:16.000 --> 50:20.440]  just made up of drunk football hooligans who were all infiltrated by British
[50:20.440 --> 50:25.600]  intelligence special branch over a decade ago even as far back as the late
[50:25.600 --> 50:30.480]  80s they were all infiltrated and the Muslims are run by this guy who's got
[50:30.480 --> 50:35.840]  direct link to the MI5 British Intel and they just get them at each other's
[50:35.840 --> 50:40.640]  throat so the media can splash it all over the front pages and it's divide
[50:40.640 --> 50:44.320]  and conquer it is Watson good job I just wanted to give you an update on this
[50:44.320 --> 50:47.920]  military situation I didn't even give the number out our phones are loaded with
[50:47.920 --> 50:52.920]  military and police I want to play this news clip though from three years ago
[50:52.920 --> 50:56.880]  about the troops on the street because now here we are three years later and
[50:56.880 --> 51:01.200]  it's actually happening we'll be right back with your phone calls attention
[51:01.200 --> 51:05.080]  gardeners this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update GCN has just
[51:05.080 --> 51:08.880]  discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants flowers and herbs it's
[51:08.880 --> 51:12.200]  called proto grow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it
[51:12.200 --> 51:16.040]  seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and
[51:16.040 --> 51:19.160]  like conditions now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for
[51:19.160 --> 51:23.280]  self-reliance proto grows unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral
[51:23.280 --> 51:26.840]  uptake and dramatically increases bloom set creating maximum plant growth in
[51:26.840 --> 51:30.080]  minimum time proto grow works by providing geometric keys which have the
[51:30.080 --> 51:33.360]  capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants
[51:33.360 --> 51:36.240]  proto grows full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables
[51:36.240 --> 51:39.680]  with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value and if you
[51:39.680 --> 51:43.240]  want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass you can if you want
[51:43.240 --> 51:47.320]  to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids it's now easy GCN listeners

[52:02.480 --> 52:06.920]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[52:06.920 --> 52:10.960]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[52:10.960 --> 52:14.840]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[52:14.840 --> 52:18.840]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[52:18.840 --> 52:23.400]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[52:23.400 --> 52:27.400]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[52:27.400 --> 52:31.200]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[52:31.200 --> 52:34.840]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[52:34.840 --> 52:39.200]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[52:39.200 --> 52:42.400]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[52:42.400 --> 52:46.040]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[54:03.920 --> 54:15.440]  This is show elementary
[54:15.440 --> 54:23.080]  foreign banks took over the US issuance of currency and credit in 1913 they
[54:23.080 --> 54:28.600]  then use the United States to basically take over the world the same banks were
[54:28.600 --> 54:32.360]  financing Hitler and the Soviets that's why they always win they finance
[54:32.360 --> 54:37.720]  everybody but through fraud they finance it out of clear blue sky backed up by
[54:37.720 --> 54:43.640]  the credit and faith of the country and now they want us bankrupt they want a
[54:43.640 --> 54:47.440]  post-industrial world we're dependent on government they've got most people
[54:47.440 --> 54:53.240]  dependent on government in one way or another and without even giving the
[54:53.240 --> 54:59.640]  number out I got police former police military former military after James
[54:59.640 --> 55:08.280]  Bradbill Garrett Keith and others Garrett hung up he was a current police I want
[55:08.280 --> 55:13.480]  to go to your calls but I briefly wanted to play just part of this RT report and
[55:13.480 --> 55:17.400]  this was reported on because the Army Times put it out that they want 20,000
[55:17.400 --> 55:21.960]  and then 300 plus thousand troops in the United States for the financial
[55:21.960 --> 55:28.640]  collapse and they add on terrorism here it is three years and 20,000 more US
[55:28.640 --> 55:33.560]  troops but not to Iraq or Afghanistan according to Pentagon officials these
[55:33.560 --> 55:38.720]  men and women will be stationed inside of the US thousands of additional
[55:38.720 --> 55:43.920]  uniformed men and women set to be trained by 2011 those service a response to a
[55:43.920 --> 55:50.080]  possible mass terror attack or civil unrest following an economic collapse so
[55:50.080 --> 55:59.480]  how concerned are Americans about this 20,000 more troops here in the US then
[55:59.480 --> 56:03.520]  freedmen of the Cato Institute a libertarian think tank explained what
[56:03.520 --> 56:08.040]  this bombshell will mean for the US is this just the beginning of this
[56:08.040 --> 56:12.560]  expansion of presidential authority of military authority here in the US I hope
[56:12.560 --> 56:16.760]  not we've seen the expansion of the use of the military within the United States
[56:16.760 --> 56:20.360]  for some time a lot of the concern with this story about these troops being used
[56:20.360 --> 56:24.240]  for domestic purposes with was that they would engage in law enforcement
[56:24.240 --> 56:27.960]  arresting people detaining them they can't do that but that hasn't stopped
[56:27.960 --> 56:32.280]  people from speculating that's enough just some right to have the army times
[56:32.280 --> 56:36.200]  said they're training to quote arrest people and pull triggers that was a
[56:36.200 --> 56:41.240]  quote now I wanted to go to Garrett he was current police but he hung up and I
[56:41.240 --> 56:46.200]  got a lot of other police former police military and after I'm done with these
[56:46.200 --> 56:50.560]  five or six callers that fill up the Genesis board our phone number can take
[56:50.560 --> 56:54.160]  unlimited calls theirs just take six calls at a time I only want to hear from
[56:54.160 --> 56:59.360]  current and police and military I want to hear from former as well but I want to
[56:59.360 --> 57:03.560]  hear specifically you know this stuff's out in the open now I mean are people
[57:03.560 --> 57:11.480]  concerned or are they just so dumb down that they think this is normal I mean if
[57:11.480 --> 57:14.600]  you've been to any third-world country you see military on the streets because
[57:14.600 --> 57:17.920]  they've got a corrupt government that's robbed everybody and and of course the
[57:17.920 --> 57:22.480]  military's for the people it doesn't stop terror attacks you don't just
[57:22.480 --> 57:27.120]  sprinkle military around for some foggy terror attack you can't protect
[57:27.120 --> 57:31.440]  everybody it's designed for the people it's designed for secret arrest it's
[57:31.440 --> 57:40.280]  designed for total control let's go to Keith and DC whose former police Keith
[57:40.280 --> 57:45.880]  what's your view on all this well basically I first of all let me thank you
[57:45.880 --> 57:48.600]  for the work you're doing you're doing a great job you're really waking people
[57:48.600 --> 57:55.400]  up secondly I wanted to let you know that as far as back as 1987 when I was on
[57:55.400 --> 58:01.520]  the DC police force Metropolitan police we were taking urban assault training
[58:01.520 --> 58:06.440]  there was a time when a bunch of us along with some other officers from
[58:06.440 --> 58:11.800]  areas close to us went to Dover Air Force Base for a weekend of what they
[58:11.800 --> 58:15.080]  called urban assault training yeah mount training I mean training's one thing
[58:15.080 --> 58:20.600]  now they're publicly merging them well I understand it but at that time then
[58:20.600 --> 58:25.800]  we're really seeing weird is that there were all these foreign people there you
[58:25.800 --> 58:29.360]  know that and that we were told not to ask where they were from of course we
[58:29.360 --> 58:32.520]  found out where they were from but they were from other countries they weren't
[58:32.520 --> 58:36.480]  police officers they were military people and they were asking us to
[58:36.480 --> 58:41.240]  instruct them all right we'll be right back stay there

[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:33.040]  having the military openly arrest citizens MPs from all four branches
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:40.040]  regular Army Marines National Guard State Guard setting up checkpoints working
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:44.640]  with the TSA it's happening and I want to hurry through your calls a lot of
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:49.320]  folks are at work they don't have to hold too long but as you hear a caller
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:54.080]  hang up we're only taking calls from military and police and before I could
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:59.040]  even give the number out the lines loaded with a lot of former military
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:03.280]  current police current military former military all that stuff former police
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:09.800]  the point is after these callers are gone we'll only take calls until I get into
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.800]  some other news at the bottom of the hour from current military and current
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:18.320]  police do you see the martial law slow motion takeover happening or are you
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:23.360]  just gonna go along with it eight hundred two five at nine ninety two thirty one

[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.680]  two five at nine nine two thirty one I just get very upset by this because I've
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:39.600]  been to third world countries I've studied history I know what the bankers
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:42.840]  have done I know this has been done by design I know it's set up for the
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:46.640]  American people now it's admitted it is and it's just so horrible because I'm
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:50.200]  not enemies with the police and military I know they're just compartmentalized
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:54.160]  following brainwashing I want to wake these men and women up before it's too
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:59.360]  late okay going back to Keith and DC talking about as a police officer
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:03.520]  training with foreign troops in mount training go ahead and finish up oh
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:08.080]  anyway thanks for getting back to me Alex what's what happened at that time
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.880]  was we were brought in thinking that we were going to be trained but I ended up
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:14.440]  being like the police officers that were there we were training all these foreign
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:18.240]  troops on how to interact with the community how to conduct searches of
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:22.720]  vehicles you know how to talk to them so you know talk to the the community when
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:26.440]  you're doing this stuff like that was you know just couldn't didn't understand
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:30.040]  what all was going on at that time I didn't think much about it didn't
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:35.000]  question it at that time and you know after I left the police force I started
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.440]  noticing all these things that are happening how it all ties in together
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:43.800]  and you know a lot of it through your show also and now look back and like oh
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:48.000]  my god what the hell are we doing this was 1987 they were doing it then we
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:54.120]  didn't even know it and now they admit Toronto Star headline Canadian and
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:59.280]  Mexican troops to occupy US during civil emergency the deals are officially
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:04.360]  signed in last year this has been signed a decade ago but it was publicly
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:09.680]  authorized by Obama as a national security perimeter and even the Congress
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:13.680]  put out a press release and said we didn't authorize this and they said
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:19.240]  sorry this is under the NAU this is under the Security Prosperity Partnership
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:26.280]  deal it's so incredible I mean when you talk to any friends that you still
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:29.560]  having the police force are they starting to see what's going on here or
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:33.800]  do they just are clueless well most the people that I was on the force with at
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:37.240]  that time you know have gone on and retired or left the force like I did
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:41.960]  voluntarily I left because I just saw things that were happening and I was
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:45.920]  told to keep my mouth shut even for this an urban assault training we did it
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:49.600]  over we were told to keep our mouth shut we weren't supposed to ask any
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:53.640]  questions of the people that were there we weren't really supposed to interact
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:57.720]  with them or anything we were threatened with you know losing our jobs if we did
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.960]  well you know what that's really about I mean that's about training you to go
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:04.880]  under federal control and take the Austin Police Department they've sent the
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:09.640]  entire SWAT team at one time or another to Iraq to go over there and be in real
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:14.920]  operations and pull triggers they're completely merged with the military you
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:17.960]  know you're totally right and what people don't understand they need to
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:22.480]  realize you know this is not some movie it's gonna have a happy ending this is
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:26.520]  real life this is what's happening it's not a conspiracy theory it's a
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:32.120]  conspiracy fact the government is doing things that are slowly eroding taking
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:36.320]  away our liberties taking away our rights well I hear you Keith as they're not
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:40.040]  even slow anymore that's the thing about tyranny it always creeps in at the edges
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:44.800]  and then starts burning faster and faster image it as the Constitution kind

[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:15.160]  it's become a real problem there are so many hundreds of mainstream news
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:22.360]  articles and press releases for regular Marines reserves regular army reserves
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:30.240]  MPs checkpoints and San Antonio with MPs highway checkpoints in Tennessee the
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:34.380]  governor says you can't do that the military says go to Hades I mean I've
[01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:38.160]  interviewed the state reps the governor's been in the news Marines
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:42.960]  taking over schools and declaring this is what martial laws like and having
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:48.000]  middle school students literally wet themselves Hobbes middle school this
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.880]  stuff's going on troops showing up blowing up cars in the front of the
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:56.280]  school telling folks that terrorists have hit I mean I've been there for that
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:01.800]  because I got a heads up on it just a psychological warfare operation and of
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:04.320]  course they announced three years ago Army times that yeah they're gonna end
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:12.200]  up 5,000 and 20,000 then finally by 2012 370 plus thousand troops on the
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:17.800]  streets of America along with the TSA that'll be their bosses and now it's
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:23.280]  here now it's here now it's happening so I want to try to just sit back talk to
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:27.520]  the military talk to police see if they realize how serious this is and what
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:31.160]  this means to our society because the real training behind the closed doors
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:34.440]  police and military have sent it to me nothing to do with quote Muslim
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:38.640]  extremists it's all gun owners Ron Paul supporters returning vets that have
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:41.680]  gotten out of the military they train the police and military to go after them
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:47.040]  they train the Boy Scouts to the Explorer scouts to take on disgruntled
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:52.040]  military they train the ROTC to do it because they're gonna have a lot of
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:55.840]  angry military all these folks that get out and then you know have their pension
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:59.560]  funds stolen or their medical care taken so they're getting ready just like
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:04.880]  Hitler a year into office wiped out most of the former military night of the
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:13.520]  long knives look into it but let's go ahead and go to Dale in California who's
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:19.040]  a Marine and Josh Bill Brian James and others go ahead Josh you're on the
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:25.760]  air or did I say Dale let's go to Dale in California first Dale go ahead hey
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:32.800]  Alex how you doing good go ahead Alex I was a part of a operation in Yuma
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:40.160]  Arizona and the funny thing about it was they had the civilian population who
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:44.760]  were running around the field we were told that what they were to do was to
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:51.600]  act hostile we were told that the the people were doing this willingly and it
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:56.240]  was supposed to be a training exercise for when we go to Iraq Afghanistan well
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:02.920]  the thing was we came in on Humvees fully fully geared completely you know
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:07.440]  ready to do this mission we come in people were running around and our
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:11.720]  object was to take these people down and to cure them the funny thing is is I
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:16.440]  don't understand what they had to do with Iraq what they had to do with
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:21.640]  Afghanistan it seemed to me like what would happen if there was a riot the
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:25.840]  fact that we were using civilian population for our training exercises
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:31.880]  really disturbed me really bothered me when this got brought up to any of my
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:37.520]  superiors we were told that you know anything like this is on American for
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:44.600]  you to see here and to question it you do have any type of problem with it it
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:48.560]  was for the security of the nation it really did it really upsets me you know
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:52.600]  I'm I joined the military thinking I was doing service for my country now you
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:56.720]  know what they're doing they're they're panning for gold but in this case
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:03.280]  they're panning for tyrants or idiots you know you go into a stream you pan
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:08.000]  the the gravel and then you look for little bitty pieces of gold and you
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.880]  sit there and you keep those and you work hard enough in a good area in a
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:16.800]  week you could have five six seven ounces of gold well they're panning that
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:21.000]  that's what all these surveys they've given the Marines are and they're
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:27.600]  finding who will shoot at Americans who who will go along with this and then as
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:33.120]  you go along with it you're advanced into cadres and units and it's put in a
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:36.720]  federal file and then when you get out well if you'll shoot at Americans and
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:40.280]  confiscate guns you're gonna have a place with the Texas State Police or
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:44.240]  you're gonna have a place with the chips you know out in California and then the
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:48.600]  chips run checkpoints with the real Marines because they're all former
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:53.600]  Marines and so so that's what they're doing they're they're building their
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:58.720]  army and we've got some breaking news please continue absolutely you know I'm
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:03.560]  I'm just I'm I'm concerned as the as to the direction that we're heading with
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:10.000]  this you know when when I join the service to help my country and my the
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.680]  services asked me to turn my back on the people which I'm supposed to protect I
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:19.600]  take that oath on the Constitution to support and protect the people who
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:24.680]  cannot do it for themselves and I feel slighted and I feel lied to you know
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:29.880]  that it's really just upset me Alex I don't know sir I need to stop you for a
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:34.160]  moment I understand you're upset we have a prisonplanet.com article courtside

[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:20.440]  the town and they fired the mayor you can't fire the elected head of the
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:25.320]  corporation they did it it's clearly illegal but the state kind of likes it
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:29.560]  this is this is good I mean and police chiefs will now become the the the
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:32.680]  hereditary kings of your town they'll be you know the police chief was known as

[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:15.360]  action took place in courtside Arizona where town councilman Joe Wilson has
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:20.920]  promoted the seizure of guns from locals a gun dealer an online
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:25.000]  entrepreneur Michael Roth because Roth allegedly glare to the councilman blocked

[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:42.240]  the point you were making oh well you know Alex I I've listened to you for a
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:47.680]  long time and I tried to have I guess pull the veil over pull it off of
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:52.380]  everyone else's eyes around me you know when I when I read the MEAC report
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:57.560]  that said that round-poll supporters you know returning veterans were being
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:03.600]  possible terrorists and I showed my fellow soldiers my fellow Marines my
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:07.600]  fellow comrades these people that I spend day and night with I eat sleep and
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:11.680]  breathe with I chose these guys and stuff and I'm told you know you're a
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:16.560]  communist you're told it's un-American again you should you should get them
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:21.280]  the literature about the murder of US Marines Army sailors and Air Force
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:25.840]  personnel in thousands of secret tests that have now been declassified and they
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:30.480]  will tell you you're an American and let me tell you I talked to one of Rick
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:34.240]  Perry's employees that high level that came to my in-game premiere he said I
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:39.200]  know this stuff's real Alex 10 years ago I was at Fort Sam Houston and they sent
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:43.360]  people down here what do you say from Fort Bragg or it was from Fort Bragg and
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:47.240]  we shot them all up and they died they didn't tell us what it was and they
[01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:51.160]  died flopping around you know a couple days later and then we were told to
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:54.760]  disinfect the area and that's how it works we do what we're told we murder
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:59.840]  our fellow servicemen it's done quietly it's done lovingly and and it's all
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:03.280]  patriotic and you don't say anything about it and then you hyperventilate and
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:07.480]  get scared of the Muslims all day I appreciate your call Dale let's talk
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:13.880]  to Josh in Florida he's current Army and then we'll go to Keith and no no
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:18.800]  one went to Keith James Brad and others Josh in Florida you're on the air go
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:27.080]  ahead oh Alex welcome yeah I just wanted to make two brief points and I've been
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:31.400]  wanting to call you on the point for a while now and the first one is that the
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:38.840]  week the Friday right after the London bombings in 2005 I was a active duty
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:46.080]  soldier in Fort Drum, New York and me and the and the other soldiers of the
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:53.000]  platoon were put on standby in order to let's say there was just a couple hours
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:58.440]  away from like New York City so we're put on standby to respond to any type of
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:04.240]  thing that might occur like in the New York subway system and once again we're
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:08.040]  active duty and they're ready to you know put us directly on call for that
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:13.120]  no they don't admit active duty will be used and if you get nerve gas like you
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:17.760]  did in the first Iraq war and all the brainstem autopsies showed that our
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:22.320]  troops were hit with sarin they won't give you treatment because they're
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:27.040]  patriotic you see it's patriotic to flush our troops down the toilet I don't
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.840]  agree with that I don't agree with our government teaming up with Al Qaeda and
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:34.800]  and publicly recognizing them as the official government of Libya and giving
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:38.520]  them the tens of millions of dollars the Qaddafi has but see that's because I'm
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:43.880]  bad and you're bad too because you're able to think Josh was anybody concerned
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:50.440]  in your unit when this was going on I am another person I didn't understand
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:54.840]  because I wasn't I guess as you say woke up one of the other people I was with
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:59.400]  he was woke up he said you know hey there's some problems with this I didn't
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:03.760]  understand the time but you know that like that's about six years ago so I
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:08.000]  fortunately welcome it last we'll say two or three years and the second key
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.600]  point I wanted to make was yeah even probably more than that was that
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:15.760]  everything to corroborate everything you're saying about the TSA it's very
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:23.560]  true it war it's warlike because whenever I was in Iraq in 0607 I did
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:28.680]  checkpoint security and I bagged that and we had they brought in the wrapping
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:34.680]  scans for the Iraqi civilians going to the camp to work and they had the body
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:39.240]  scanners and they also have the extra machines and I knew that to wrap the
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:45.940]  skin for the last nowadays and I tell you what Josh I want to hear more about the
[01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:52.520]  rapist scans and you know the Pentagon admits that's public that life in America
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:56.360]  will be like Iraq we are all going to be prisoners we'll be right back stay with
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:58.360]  us
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:05.600]  question can functional magnetic resonance imaging be used to read our
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:11.480]  minds author Jose Calazzo answers yes in his two new books America's new
[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:17.000]  slavery for more than 13 years author Jose Calazzo has been trying to prove
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.400]  that the US government has the capacity to read a person's thoughts with a
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:27.240]  revolutionary technology known as fmri functional magnetic resonance imaging
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:32.080]  and there is proof that it exists America's new slavery explores this
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:36.680]  technology and it's many possible applications in national security who
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:41.840]  has access to it how is it being used does America's salvation rest in this
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:46.640]  technology these and many other questions are answered in America's new
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:53.480]  slavery the new books by Jose Calazzo available on bn.com amazon.com and
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:21:01.040]  borders.com America's new slavery all Americans should be concerned have you
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:03.680]  ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:07.880]  financial affairs I continue to hear stories about property seizures frozen
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:11.880]  bank accounts confiscation of stocks and bonds it makes me wonder if the US
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:15.500]  citizen will ever again have the right to life liberty and the pursuit of
[01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:20.000]  happiness unfortunately with the drug and money laundering act the IRS revenue

[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:33.120]  town well I guess the three they fired all the others to and have declared
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:37.080]  themselves God this has become a national news story and even I was
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:43.320]  watching Fox News business last night Napolitano show and they were calling it
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:47.400]  martial law and that's what it is so that so the mayor he's only popping in
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:55.040]  for five minutes so I'll get to Josh and Adrian and James and Brad and Bill I
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:25:01.600]  was finishing up with Josh in Florida or was it Bill I get the I was Josh Josh
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:06.760]  finishing up with the point you were making yes Alex I was making a point
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:15.280]  about in 2007 Rapperscan was introduced it you know checkpoints in Iraq and the
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:21.760]  one I worked in Baghdad it had you know Rapperscan with the full body you know
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:27.800]  a naked body scanner it was abused by supervisors who would think oh this
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:33.200]  Iraq female looks attractive I want to see what she looks like they can in the
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:39.400]  body scanner we had checkpoints very similar to the how the airports work
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:43.960]  and operate it's just a massive police state we had the metal detectors the
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:48.040]  people get pat down and then they go to the full body scanners now when you go
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:53.800]  through look I already knew this but it was about four years ago my wife said I
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:59.560]  want some of that Cajun food up the street and I went into the Cypress
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:06.000]  Grill and I went over to the bar ordered the food sat there and while we're
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.360]  waiting on the food to take it home there was a pile of magazines and one was
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:14.100]  MIT magazine and I just reached over and pulled it up and there they were
[01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:17.760]  admitting oh MIT developed this in the last ten years with the Pentagon the
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:21.840]  systems in Iraq will be used in America we will have face scanner systems at the
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:25.440]  airports and there will be body scanners similar to what is in Iraq and
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:29.960]  when you learn that when you go into an airport you are under arrest they are
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:34.720]  declaring that you are under arrest it is a custodial arrest and then they put
[01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:38.160]  you in a scanner but what about the troops standing around those body
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:42.400]  scanners they do give you cancer I mean it really is what kills you is being
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:48.200]  around those all day but the scary part is I know the military now tries
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:53.120]  to recruit goons and gangbangers what types of people were like man she looks
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:57.280]  good I want to look at her because no self-respecting man I mean a real man
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:02.080]  wants a woman to want them you know is into honoring women love women so much
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:07.120]  you'd never you know you know be like only the scum of the earth would want
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:11.960]  to defile a woman like that and would want to see a woman naked without I mean
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:15.800]  these are peeping toms these are criminals I mean what was this your
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:19.520]  commanders that would say I want to see her get her in here that was actually
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:24.160]  the the head sergeant who is actually the overall supervisor of the check
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:29.440]  and so he really and then of course there's Abu Ghraib or they admit all
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:33.480]  the raping went on if he took a particular liking was she sent to
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:38.360]  Ghraib that I'm not sure but that was also a thing that would occasionally
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:42.040]  threatened whenever someone I had a problem with one the local Iraqis who
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:45.600]  would be at the camp working they would sit with you know we would be told to see
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:49.640]  oh tell them that you know if they don't listen to what we say they got to go to
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:53.960]  Abu Ghraib you know prison and and it would literally frighten and stir them
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:57.680]  happen yeah because they just said I'm tortured tens of thousands there and now
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:00.840]  the good guys have including five-year-olds with battery acid I'm not
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:03.640]  gonna say how they kill them with the battery acid but it's what Captain
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:09.000]  America does and I'm unpatriotic as I'm against it but so absolutely no that's
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.920]  admitted that the face scanners that they already have an Iraq that's now
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:16.600]  coming to the airports as well it's total prisoner induction did any of the
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:20.920]  troops when they come back point out that you know wow this is the same thing
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:27.400]  happening in Iraq there were a few and fortunately not all of the people I was
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:31.560]  in Iraq with enjoyed that sort of thing in fact there were quite a bit who would
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:37.280]  actually speak out about the Iraq war and say well it was just about oil you
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:42.080]  know and money and there were soldiers who didn't like the way that some of
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:45.960]  their actors were treated it seemed like it was more along the lines of maybe
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:49.960]  higher-ranking higher-ranking soldiers well that's who they promote is the
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:54.200]  psychopaths yeah who shouldn't be in the uniform but that evil armies recruit
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:58.800]  those guys good armies recruit people where in George Washington's day if you
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:03.480]  did something like that and you he would hang you you would be hung for doing
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:07.880]  that to a woman but again he's an al-Qaeda sympathizer George Washington is
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:14.160]  is a demon I mean I have FEMA on tape demonizing George Washington to police
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:19.200]  officers and the cops agreeing so that's and they want the good cops to
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:22.320]  freak out when they demonize George Washington they're there saying George
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:26.440]  Washington's bad America's bad Bill of Rights is bad Thomas Jefferson's a

[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:08.200]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:12.480]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:16.760]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:21.080]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:25.160]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:29.720]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:33.840]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:37.800]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:58.000]  that this is the essence of tyranny it's a bluff they arrest anyone at city
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:02.720]  council meetings that signs up to speak who criticizes them even politely now
[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:05.120]  they've just banned anyone in the government building so they have the
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:10.920]  the meetings privately but videotaped them they have declared martial law and
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:14.520]  the state police are investigating but the governor's done nothing and now
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:19.040]  they've arrested a pastor for filming on a sidewalk they say that's not allowed
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:22.720]  and they're now saying anyone that's criticized them is going to have their
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:27.600]  guns turned into the police chief and that's escalation Arizona firearms
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:33.160]  confiscated judge orders stunning action after councilman called turd another
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:37.840]  guy they say had anger in his eyes so his guns are I've got to be turned in and
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:42.960]  and the pastor's been arrested and this is a microcosm of the new world order
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:47.320]  foreign banks no authority totally criminal caught criminal Senate committee
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:52.800]  says they're criminal and they run the Pentagon and the Pentagon is openly
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:58.800]  trying to take over society now I take you to Ed Foster who is the mayor but
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:02.520]  he's been told he's fired and the police are there and they lock the doors and
[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:06.200]  they have the guns and he hasn't escalated it he just you know says well
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:09.920]  I'm still the mayor and they say no you're not and there's magic paychecks
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:13.320]  disappearing into the stratosphere they've been trying to find out for a
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:18.200]  year where that were those go and boss hog doesn't have anything on this town
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:24.320]  so joining us with the pastor being arrested he must have been evil and the
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:28.880]  gun confiscations now well I tell you Ed I mean this is this is really getting
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:34.320]  crazy mayor okay first I gotta correct that that wasn't the pastor that got
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:40.120]  erected it was one of his leading church members he didn't get arrested he got
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:45.080]  chased to the church he took sanctuary in the church okay well I'm sorry for
[01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:49.240]  getting it wrong he would talk to my producer and that's what I've been told
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:54.600]  okay so tell us exactly what's happened with a very angry chief of police or he
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:58.520]  would have been arrested but he was taking photographs with one of their
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:04.360]  secret meetings on the sidewalk I'm standing on the public side in fact the
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:07.600]  Attorney General's office when we complained about the open meetings on
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:12.560]  violation he suggested we get evidence for him or he couldn't do anything so
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:16.400]  this guy was taking the Attorney General's advice trying to gather some
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:20.760]  mayor mayor I wanted to give you the floor here because I know you're busy
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:23.480]  we just got five minutes with you then I'm going to all these current former
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:28.800]  military dealing with the same issue but but but let's just reset here recap
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:33.240]  what's happened in court site and then if the Attorney General needs evidence
[01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:37.440]  they have released the videos of meetings where they admit that people aren't
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:42.360]  allowed inside the public council meetings so so they're very proud of
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:47.760]  themselves absolutely the state of Arizona is doing nothing my message to
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:55.400]  the world today is well of course I'd burn Phoenix it'll okay so recap tell us
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:37:00.320]  the names tell us about the gun confiscation orders actually that was
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:07.080]  obscene but this judge by mr. Winslow his own testimony he's an unstable PTSD
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:13.920]  veteran who's himself getting done and he's threatened feels threatened and he
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:18.960]  don't know what he's gonna do and yet mr. Ross guns are confiscated not mr.
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:23.800]  mr. Winslow is the one who should have been placed under under sanction and his
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:28.920]  weapons confiscated by his own testimony in court you know but this is not the
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:33.800]  way things work in court site you know upside down backwards in every aspect of
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:38.040]  life in court site and we're gonna take it back we're gonna make work yes sir
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:44.720]  mayor so so so lay out the gun confiscation orders lay out the person
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:48.840]  being chased they tried to arrest for daring even videotape the city council
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:53.560]  building lay out where this is going and are they going to declare the police
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:58.320]  chief supreme emperor of court site well that's already done sir I mean when
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:04.560]  you have a state of the normal state of emergency that the chief constitutional
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:09.480]  officer available which would have been either me or the vice mayor or the
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:13.760]  succeeding council member should have been placed in charge the normal thing
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:17.960]  that the emergency does it removes the chain of command between the chief
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:22.520]  executive and the in the law enforcement but in this case they've
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:26.600]  removed me completely from the next in the town manager and the chief of
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:32.240]  police who are the people that by all accounts are guilty of crime criminal act
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:39.720]  federal criminal acts under title night title nine section 241 and 242
[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:44.960]  conspiracy and a deprivation of rights under color of law those are two
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:49.440]  federal crimes that by police testimony they are guilty of but those same
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:53.480]  policemen are the ones that are under house arrest now mayor hold on give the
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:57.520]  proper title you mean you're saying the emperor is guilty of something the
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:01.680]  emperor is sovereign and is not under your laws as Dick Cheney said five years
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:06.040]  ago he's not even in the executive he's his own branch of government so this is
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:11.880]  the furor precept so you're claiming that that he's a pretender to the throne
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:15.840]  how dare you mayor elected say that he's not the emperor of court site now
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:19.600]  continuing let's get into this gun confiscation here and where this
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:24.640]  insanity is going well I'll tell you what there's a hearing today but right
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:28.400]  now I'm in Phoenix trying to get somebody in Phoenix to listen but like I
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:33.600]  said Phoenix is fiddling with course I burn and I can't get addressed to
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:38.520]  anybody in Phoenix I've tried the US Attorney's Office I stood in the lobby
[01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:42.920]  and declared that there's an emergency in court site and they their response was
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:46.680]  well send us the written form and we'll write you back you know well people are
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:50.800]  going to get hurt for tonight somebody needs to step in mayor you know why this
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:54.160]  is being done but did the city manager ever tell you about the
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:59.120]  comprehensive annual financial reports never you see you're totally about a
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:05.600]  budget financials at all I'm I'm read I'm asked to absolutely barred when I got
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:11.640]  elected I asked to see some reports the same councilman who have actually given
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:18.800]  the chief is 007 licensed out there in sworn testimony one of the one of the
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:23.880]  sworn officers signed a statement that a councilman had told him they had ordered
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:28.840]  the chief in court change remarks go get them meaning the political opponents
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:34.840]  in town so come on we have running court site not anything and you've not been
[01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:37.800]  allowed to see the financial since you've been in there now let me explain
[01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:43.280]  what's happening this is all a hat trick like a magician they took a Chicago mob
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:47.680]  model that they used to rob the city of Chicago from the 20s 30s and 40s Chicago
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:53.920]  1313 this is on record and in the 50s the feds got all the states and counties to
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:41:00.600]  adopt a comprehensive annual financial report system now that's the real set of
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:04.580]  books everybody is then including the kept councils like kept juries and
[01:41:04.580 --> 01:41:10.200]  ran juries is only told about the budget and then the the the real corporate
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:14.880]  officer is the city or county manager they hold all the financials and then
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:19.680]  you're only told about what's on the budget not about the investments and
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:23.440]  because you found out about the phantom checks being paid to who you can't find
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:27.360]  out and all this weirdness the state isn't going to help you because all the
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:31.640]  municipalities are doing this and the state is doing this so they've got to
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:38.240]  stick together okay I'm sorry go ahead mayor yeah I you know what I don't
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:41.960]  generally subscribe to these conspiracy theories but now I'm living one
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:49.280]  myself becoming more of a reality every day you know the police officers are
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:54.600]  convinced right now that the evidence they've turned over the EPSS quarter is
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:58.280]  being covered up you know that their their chief is not going to get in any
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:04.080]  trouble well no this is the way you do things in the new America but but sir
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:08.120]  comprehensive annual financial reports I've made films on it this is public
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:11.920]  information hidden in plain view the double set of books it's just that the
[01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:16.160]  mafia taught the US government and then local governments basically the system
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:21.160]  so so look into that but see they'll have those in corporate bond filings you'll
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:26.000]  even be able to find that they can make the city numbers secret from you through
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:31.400]  their corruption they can't see I was trained I went to a training class on
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:36.080]  government accounting and auditing yes sir and in that room there was a large
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:41.640]  collection of elected officials it was like the first time of them and there
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:46.520]  were a lot of people in that room and some of them you know I was an engineer
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:50.320]  and I ran for pretty big budget on projects and I know a little bit about
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:53.440]  accounting but there were actual corporate account accounts in this room
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:58.840]  and by the time we got done they were screening because government accounting
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:03.720]  and rules are so obscene and so too that even people with an accounting
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:08.800]  background cannot chase the money and government accounting method it's just
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:13.920]  built in they that's the way they account mayor speak up for us a little bit
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:18.160]  please sir okay well I say when the government accounting and auditing
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:22.360]  methods are so obtuse that people with an accounting background were screaming
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:27.600]  when I went through this training there is no way that they could they make it
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:31.640]  so that the average person can understand the books they can confuse it
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:35.840]  can feel it hide it shuffle it around yes sir the books that they run and they
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:40.560]  can say they have a state audit it means nothing they're exactly so so you do
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:45.160]  know about it good but but but the big enchiladas hidden in plain view it's
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:50.160]  the annual comprehensive annual financial report or caffers now now let me
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:53.440]  stop because you're a busy man we appreciate your time and you just said
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:56.840]  people are going to get hurt you're saying in court to get this gun
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:44:01.000]  confiscation ruling that that one of the council members said I'm scared I'm
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:06.720]  PTSD veteran I'm buying guns and that's the sign right there of a problem and so
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:13.040]  now off of calling someone a piece of poop a turd I'm sorry to use that term on
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:17.400]  the radio folks but come on this is news it is a family show but this is a news
[01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:22.240]  program that's I what was said and we're that goody-two-shoes mayor we don't use
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:27.920]  it even use words like that normally and on top of it mayor they're talking about
[01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:32.240]  other folks that had a glint of anger in their eyes and now you're not allowed to
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:36.480]  videotape even the council building from the outside fill us in on why you're
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:41.120]  saying people are going to get hurt if the emperor is challenged well you know
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:47.720]  this this chief of police you know by every outlaw and force agency I've talked
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:52.520]  to they would agree with my character your station that he's acting irrational
[01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:56.760]  they've never heard of this they that's the constant comment I've heard they've
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:02.320]  never heard of anything like this yet he is allowed to stand as you say as the
[01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:07.560]  emperor of port site right now and people are some people have left town
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:11.880]  especially you know some of the political supporters of me have left town
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:16.680]  because they're actually scared to be in town right now you know this the you go
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:20.400]  around we go around in groups to make sure that we're not exposing ourselves
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:24.760]  well on but we're carrying audio and video recording equipment with us at all
[01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:30.960]  time so that you know we're prepared to at least record our demise you know well
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:34.960]  you know what Thomas Jefferson said mayor he said that and George Washington
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:39.880]  repeated similar lines that when the government fears the people there is
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:43.200]  liberty when the people fear the government there is tyranny and we got
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:47.920]  a big fat T in court site so world that now is reporting multiple people ordered
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:51.400]  to turn their guns into the police chief and I'm sorry the emperor of court
[01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:55.600]  site and you're talking about these hearings what happened at these hearings
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:46:02.000]  well I was the range yesterday mr. Odom the former first mayor of the town
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:07.760]  person responsible for organizing town he was to appear but his attorneys
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:15.440]  appeared for him in actually he's his girlfriend scared of me left town so the
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:22.080]  case was in court yesterday Jennifer Harris or Jones she's a cop very Jennifer
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:27.200]  Jones was in court with me we were all being arraigned at various charges or
[01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:32.720]  hearings on various charges that this chief of police has manufactured oh yeah
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:36.440]  I forgot he's not only fired almost all the cops and put him on house arrest
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:40.280]  that's all that on Fox News he's charging you with stuff oh it gets better oh
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:45.400]  yeah he's charged you know and that's just proof that when these officers said
[01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:49.640]  that the councilman told them the chief has been ordered to go get them that
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:55.240]  really means that he's good at his job he's out there getting us you know so
[01:46:55.240 --> 01:47:00.720]  what evil have you committed mayor I'm nothing I'll I'll tell you what all I
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:05.160]  ever did my life was be a hard-working no no but what are the charges that the
[01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:10.040]  emperor has leveled I was trying to tell him that he arrested Miss Jones on our
[01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:14.400]  third arrest that it might not be in the best interest of the tax court site
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:19.680]  because of the ongoing lawsuit she had that you know I asked if he was trying
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:23.880]  to give her an attorney a field in court and I guess my advice to him was
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:27.960]  taken as the interfering in his police operations and that's what I was charged
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:31.680]  with kind of like when she was there in citizen communications trying to
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:34.880]  politely talk and the police you came up and started arresting her and you're
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:39.120]  the mayor you say it's citizens communication and he just said no and
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:43.280]  took her out I mean and so now you the mayor well I guess they're saying you're
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:45.960]  not the mayor even though they don't have the authority they're saying you're not
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:49.400]  the mayor and by the way you're criminally charged well that's that's and
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:54.800]  and so who is this judge like I said we now have we we now and I've been saying
[01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:58.640]  it for years that this is you know selective enforcement of any law in
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:03.360]  town but now we have sworn testimony that if we have an officer's sworn
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:08.400]  testimony and since then I've had a couple of citizens come for us and say
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:13.560]  well you know councilman so-and-so told me the same thing you know so I have
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:19.160]  multiple witnesses willing to testify that this console is using police
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:24.440]  force to enforce their political agenda on the community and by the way folks
[01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:28.800]  are saying why are people getting arrested and facing 90 days in jail for
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:33.560]  a garden why why are people not allowed to have citizens communication why is
[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:38.080]  government so openly corrupt they want you to know that's why the state
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:42.360]  government is going to fully back them there because they like this idea of a
[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:45.600]  police chief in fact they're trying to do this in many areas just get rid of
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:49.520]  government altogether and have a town administrator that that works for the
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:52.640]  bankers and we can all just be sharecroppers to them and they can raise
[01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:56.880]  taxes and we can't see it America is going into foreign banking receivership
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:01.440]  mayor and this is a good message for America that you know the police chief
[01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:06.240]  says a mayor goes he goes so I mean you know this is the new freedom sir well
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:16.440]  I'll tell you what it's not the freedom I served my country for and as a marine I'm not gonna let it exist I'm after on the job right now now now they don't
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:20.760]  even let you in the city council building correct now I mean no no what they're
[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:26.560]  doing is as a result of the one meeting where they locked the doors and took away
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:32.880]  people's right to speak and took away the life they took a voter martial law
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:37.720]  whatever they did it's behind locked door that's an illegal meeting and cannot
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:42.920]  prevail I've asked the Attorney General to declare that being a legal if any
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:48.560]  action taken behind locked doors to be also declared no avoid that and if that
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:53.640]  were so then they can our meetings are scheduled for the second and fourth

[01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:07.000]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:11.000]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:14.920]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:18.920]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:23.480]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:27.520]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:31.280]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:34.960]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:09.360]  folks Sheriff Richard Mack to me with us at the gate after I'm gonna get to
[01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:15.400]  Adrian James Brad Mill ahead of Sheriff Mack coming in to talk about the
[01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:21.200]  militarization of police court site fast and furious White House completely
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:25.520]  caught running the whole thing to blame the Second Amendment I mean this is big
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:29.840]  but hey they're the government so they're allowed to see that's the essence of
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:35.920]  tyranny and I remember reading about a day into Katrina it turns out black water
[01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:39.600]  reportedly the mayor's not talked about it came in and said we're under you know
[01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:42.800]  we're in command and the mayor said get out of here and they left but it's that
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:47.720]  attempt and that's what tyrants do they always attempt it's kind of like a
[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:53.800]  parrot will test a branch with their beak to see if they can get on it and if you
[01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:56.800]  bend over over and over again it'll get worse and worse and worse and then
[01:54:56.800 --> 01:55:00.200]  government will engage in corruption and then when you try to take the government
[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:04.800]  back they can't let you back in because if you're if real government is to take
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:09.480]  over again they're gonna find all the stealing and then people are gonna go
[01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:13.440]  you know go to jail so that's what tyranny is I'm gonna go to Adrian here in a
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:17.920]  moment but finishing up with the mayor of court site fired by the police chief
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:21.720]  and counsel though they can't do that everybody knows that you've got the
[01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:25.760]  police the majority of them you know going public so then they're put on leave
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:29.760]  and I saw it in the news they said in the council yes you're not allowed to
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:34.400]  leave your houses and they're now chasing camera people when the attorney
[01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:39.720]  general asked him a briefly mayor tell folks about that
[01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:44.400]  now from the Attorney General's office when we complained about the fact that
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:48.160]  the council was meeting at one of the council and restaurant you know and they
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:52.080]  said well you gotta send us proof so this gentleman went to the restaurant stood
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:57.080]  on the public sidewalk out front let's photographing license plate he was
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:01.400]  chased from that scene by the chief of police and he saw sanctuary at his
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:08.560]  church and he is a leading member of that church but he's not some while
[01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:12.840]  hierarchical or anything he's just upset the town government look at you having
[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:17.460]  to make excuses for somebody to videotape a diner I mean this is what
[01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:21.480]  America's come to and that's the essence of tyranny's when cops beat people up
[01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:24.840]  and arrest them for videotaping them and it's happening more and more this this
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:30.480]  and they're hiring people that think this is fun so we're not only hiring
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:33.400]  people that think it's fun they're hiring people that will do it and then
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:37.320]  give me gun orders to do that that's what this council has done and then if the
[01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:41.880]  mayor says this isn't a good idea and go do it and then when the mayor says don't
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:44.880]  arrest that woman for speaking at citizens communication they turn around
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:51.680]  and charge you oh I've been charged with a lot of crimes let's say I was charged
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:56.280]  with felony harassment I was charged with false reporting I run a newspaper
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:01.280]  I reported a problem with public drinking water of course I they raised
[01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:06.720]  hell with that had me they tried to try to charge me the county attorney refused
[01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:14.240]  to do that one when I got elected they tried to come up with a election
[01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:19.120]  fraud charge again the county attorney said no to that one and on this recent
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:24.160]  one the charges interfering in police operations the two counts of disorderly
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:29.600]  conduct the county attorney told him he'd read told me he'd read the report
[01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:33.520]  not guilty of a crime so rather than charge me with a felony that he had to
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:40.760]  pursue they did it as a misdemeanor what about what about Fox News is it true
[01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:44.920]  that when I saw it last night Fox News reported I think you were on there Fox
[01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:50.440]  News reported that they have ordered the eight police that they put on leave to
[01:57:50.440 --> 01:57:56.240]  not leave their homes yes they're under house arrest 8 a.m. till noon and from
[01:57:56.240 --> 01:58:00.840]  1 p.m. to 5 and then they're being called in and being interviewed right now
[01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:06.680]  during the day occasionally they're called in the one lady who was the clerk
[01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:12.680]  in the office she didn't because she's not a foreign officer she did not have
[01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:18.320]  the same protection that the officers had so they summarily fired her
[01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:24.400]  fortunately for her and her family the county attorney's office had a lady that
[01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:28.680]  out on medical leave and they county attorney stepped up gave her a job so
[01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:33.280]  she her family at least that all right we'll continue to watch this mayor and
[01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:38.320]  be careful boss I'll get boss I'll tell you what if they get me I think I just

[02:01:24.640 --> 02:01:28.160]  day I can't tell you began to tell you I was absolutely disgusted I was watching
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:33.840]  a sports show and one of the commercials had US Navy commercial on it and on the
[02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:37.440]  at the very end of the commercial it said the US Navy a global force for good
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:41.320]  the last time I checked you know I signed on to the military and the last time I
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:43.920]  checked I mean I'm a good old boy but I thought I was here to fight for the
[02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:48.320]  sovereignty and the freedom and the liberty of independent citizens of
[02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:52.800]  the nation and for the enforcement of the Constitution not to be a global
[02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:56.680]  force for good not to enforce globalism it's just unbelievable the
[02:01:56.680 --> 02:02:00.400]  commercial played through and I haven't heard a single person comment on it it's
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:05.160]  just the blinding of America you know so I went to some of my my Marines and I
[02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:08.160]  asked them hey do you have any idea what we fight for do you know what what our
[02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:12.120]  responsibilities are and one of my Marines had had the audacity I mean it's
[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:16.760]  come full circle the blinding of the nation the blinding of Americans the
[02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:20.240]  Marine told me yeah my job is to do whatever whatever the president told me
[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:24.960]  to do I mean how insane is that you know it's like people have completely lost
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:29.200]  their focus in what they're supposed to in what they stand for and who we are
[02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:35.840]  it's just unbelievable so they have no idea when you talk to them what our
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:40.000]  military supposedly for I'm talking about active duty service members that
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:44.240]  was very polite of me we do whatever the president tells us to do and when we
[02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:48.160]  take the oath of enlistment we don't swear to a president we don't swear to a
[02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:51.680]  person to an ideology we smear we swear to uphold and defend the
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:55.480]  Constitution the Constitutional United States against all enemies both foreign
[02:02:55.480 --> 02:02:59.720]  and domestic and it just blows my mind how people are just are just brainwashed
[02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:05.360]  and and believe that their mission is to enforce the regulations that the
[02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:08.880]  president at that time says to enforce it's just a total brainwashing of
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:13.920]  everything that we have from where we were to what we've become and it's and
[02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:17.520]  it's sad to see it firsthand and I mean I'm just scared to see what happens
[02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:21.600]  ten years from now because the dumbing down of America has continued to go and
[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:25.200]  things are getting worse and worse people are more dependent on the welfare
[02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:29.040]  system people are more dependent on government housing and they're being
[02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:33.920]  born and bred to to buy into this you know people are born and bred to say
[02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:37.120]  hey don't do good in school that way you can be part of welfare that way you can
[02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:40.640]  get government housing but what it does is it makes us more dependent on the
[02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:44.880]  government more dependent on them to to provide for us and you go right into a
[02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:50.040]  socialist system it's it's just it's it's just like I mean you can see a wide
[02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:54.240]  open and people are just so I don't know if they're unwilling to open their eyes
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:58.080]  or they just or they just well it's like the police officers said earlier in the
[02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:02.440]  last hour this movie doesn't have a happy ending I mean these globalists are
[02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:06.720]  really corrupt really evil I mean they've been caught put the stuff in the
[02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:10.560]  food and water I mean bad people are running things and they're trying to
[02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:14.920]  get a straightjacket over us and they want to send tyrants to our door in a
[02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:20.200]  uniform we've got to reach out to the police and military now that's why
[02:04:20.200 --> 02:04:24.120]  they're so upset about Oath Keepers that's why they're so upset about Sheriff
[02:04:24.120 --> 02:04:29.760]  Richard Mack was about to be in studio now moved to Texas that's why they're
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:34.000]  so upset about us because they know that the police and military are listening
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:37.600]  and now going wow this makes sense now I understand why this has been happening

[02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:52.920]  join us tonight at prisonplanet.tv at 7 p.m. central standard time if you're not
[02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:56.720]  a member it is your prisonplanet.tv memberships that funds so much of what
[02:09:56.720 --> 02:10:00.280]  we do here in this operation and we're more than happy for the TV show after
[02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:04.640]  it's aired live then be leaked out of the web to tens of millions of people
[02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:08.440]  that's our goal but it is the members that get the higher quality streams the
[02:10:08.440 --> 02:10:13.640]  larger archives that get the information first and you really are our
[02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:18.080]  backers at prisonplanet.tv and we couldn't have done all of this without
[02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:21.440]  you and if you're not a member or let your membership lapse we're adding more
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:25.520]  and more features to prisonplanet.tv and a few months after the TV show
[02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:29.200]  launches we're gonna keep prisonplanet.tv but we're also gonna create a
[02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:33.280]  whole new platform that's gonna have the special reports my reports live on the
[02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:39.560]  road the behind-the-scenes stuff and the the nightly TV show separately and so
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:43.760]  everything that's on prisonplanet.tv is gonna be cloned over to the new site
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:47.840]  and then we'll give you a passcode of your prisonplanet.tv member to the new
[02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:51.360]  site so basically with a membership you're gonna end up getting both sites so
[02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:55.280]  you can sign up at either or and get the membership to both but I frankly want to
[02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:58.960]  totally new platform prisonplanet.tv's been reworked and it's great but we're
[02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:01.960]  gonna have a totally new you know it's easier to start over from scratch
[02:11:01.960 --> 02:11:06.160]  platform and then we'll have both you know operating out of the future which
[02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:10.920]  is always my way of doing things we just add more more more more and we like to
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:14.040]  have backups redundancy because every few months we have a problem with
[02:11:14.040 --> 02:11:18.280]  infowords.com like yesterday it was down off and on well we had prisonplanet.com
[02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:23.040]  and so the it's all about getting the information out now for the rest of the
[02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:28.160]  hour now we're talking to Sheriff Richard Mack last time I saw him was late
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:34.720]  last year to a packed house that we spoke to out in Santa Cruz, California
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:39.760]  former sheriff of Graham County Arizona longtime crusader for freedom of
[02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:44.040]  individual rights in 94 he filed a lawsuit challenging the Brady Bill to
[02:11:44.040 --> 02:11:47.440]  stop the federal government from forcing another undue mandate down our
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:51.320]  throats and he won he lectures and gives seminars and constitutional issues
[02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:56.240]  relating to gun control law enforcement states rights the farce otherwise known
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:12:01.360]  as the drug war and the oath of office sheriff Mack.com Sheriff Richard Mack

[02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:20.320]  standing up for freedom and these other Texans that continue to say they're
[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:25.920]  Texans and yet they back down from threats for the federal government even
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:32.480]  state congressman or state rep Dan Patrick said hey if you tell us to back
[02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:36.400]  down especially the federal government that makes us even all the stronger and
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:40.840]  that's really what Texas is about to me Texas independence and the spirit of
[02:12:40.840 --> 02:12:44.840]  the Alamo and remember the Alamo that's yeah I'm not knocking folks moving to
[02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:48.600]  New Hampshire to have their free state project but give me a break folks Austin

[02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:59.480]  no exception well I mean the FBI can't stick their hands down your pants and
[02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:03.840]  they go in the pants FBI can't put you in a microwave oven this is just a total
[02:15:03.840 --> 02:15:08.600]  federal power grab I want to get into I want to say one other thing that you
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:13.240]  mentioned already you said this was an arrest situation I have to tell you Alex
[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:18.400]  that the groping and or let me just call it what it is the frisking quote the
[02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:25.320]  frisking that happens there is exactly the same as when you arrest somebody
[02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:29.320]  except it gets a little bit because it because I've been through it I've asked
[02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:33.520]  them I said I'm not taking the picture first me whatever you want to do I'm
[02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:36.560]  not taking your picture because I fly all the time I don't drive to those these
[02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:41.240]  places I go I I fly and so I wanted to see it I said you know what I spent 20
[02:15:41.240 --> 02:15:44.920]  years of law enforcement that's the exact same frisking except you get you do
[02:15:44.920 --> 02:15:49.880]  too much in the crotch that happens to someone's who's who's arrested so it
[02:15:49.880 --> 02:15:55.440]  gives a lot of credence to what you said that it is an arrest situation they are
[02:15:55.440 --> 02:16:01.280]  being treated exactly everyone that goes through TSA is treated exactly as if
[02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:04.960]  they were under arrest or somebody going into Abu Ghraib and that's where the
[02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:09.120]  scanners and all of us even worse got developed the Pentagon intends this for
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:13.520]  the streets of America now there's so many issues I want to get in with get
[02:16:13.520 --> 02:16:17.360]  into with you Sheriff Mack but first off just because we ended the last hour
[02:16:17.360 --> 02:16:21.040]  with us what is your take on what's happening in court site well I need to
[02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:25.960]  tell you you mentioned both keepers earlier and how you know a lot of
[02:16:25.960 --> 02:16:29.720]  government officials are getting really weary of oath keepers and me because
[02:16:29.720 --> 02:16:33.320]  we're out here saying that you know we should follow the Constitution you took
[02:16:33.320 --> 02:16:38.120]  an oath and you should keep it Stewart Rhodes has been asked to be a lawyer down
[02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:43.960]  there and help I believe Mayor Foster and Jennifer Jones I know he's working
[02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:47.760]  with Jennifer Jones I thought it was the mayor also but anyway Stewart Rhodes is
[02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:54.880]  their lawyer and he's hopefully gonna have a lot to report on that the the
[02:16:54.880 --> 02:17:03.320]  bottom line with court site is I think it is a typical indication and typical
[02:17:03.320 --> 02:17:08.920]  example of government run amuck it's a small area it's a small town and it
[02:17:08.920 --> 02:17:14.080]  shows a chief of police who absolutely thinks he's king and can do whatever he
[02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:20.160]  wants and how is it that a mayor is fired who's elected by the people there
[02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:25.960]  if the people want him removed they can do it but for him to be removed in this
[02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:31.400]  Gestapo type fashion is absolutely deplorable the truth is he's very popular
[02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:35.320]  and it's because of reported corruption that that's why they're acting so he's
[02:17:35.320 --> 02:17:38.720]  been fighting it yeah he's been fighting and standing against the corruption what
[02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:43.440]  would you do if you were the sheriff in that county because the sheriff is in
[02:17:43.440 --> 02:17:48.480]  power by the state Constitution correct me if I'm wrong but the the cities are
[02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:52.760]  under that in constitutional power because they're a incorporated creation
[02:17:52.760 --> 02:17:57.480]  of the people I mean is it the governor the state police what would you do if
[02:17:57.480 --> 02:18:03.480]  you were the sheriff and the police are now arresting people for videotaping the
[02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:07.640]  city council building or you know a sheriff and I've certainly thought of
[02:18:07.640 --> 02:18:12.120]  this scenario before and certainly this would be one of the worst case scenarios
[02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:16.760]  that a sheriff would want to have to address but he has to he is the ultimate
[02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:22.440]  constitutional authority there it's his it's his jurisdiction I mean it is and
[02:18:22.440 --> 02:18:26.440]  I'm not sure which county court site is in somebody's going to fill me in on that
[02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:30.080]  I'm not sure I know that they're on the way west side so it could be La Paz
[02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:34.320]  County or maybe even Yuma County I'm not sure which one they're in I think it's
[02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:39.480]  human but it regardless of that the the county sheriff should be stepping in at
[02:18:39.480 --> 02:18:43.720]  this point it's gotten too way too out of control and there's far too many
[02:18:43.720 --> 02:18:51.360]  constitutional violations and I fear that if he doesn't what county it's La
[02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:56.280]  Paz County okay I thought it was La Paz and La Paz is the newest county also in
[02:18:56.280 --> 02:19:00.320]  the state but it's a very small county very small area and the sheriff there
[02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:04.440]  should actually you know take the bull by the horn and make sure that Mayor
[02:19:04.440 --> 02:19:08.320]  Foster's prediction does not come true somebody needs to come in there and
[02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:12.400]  settle this down before violence does happen and somebody needs to put that
[02:19:12.400 --> 02:19:18.240]  chief of police in in place and somebody an independent investigation needs to
[02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:22.040]  take place of that chief and that why do you think the state for a month has been
[02:19:22.040 --> 02:19:27.240]  sitting on its hands because they're wimpy and they're go along government let
[02:19:27.240 --> 02:19:32.200]  me tell anybody right now that might have any mistaken notion that Governor
[02:19:32.200 --> 02:19:36.400]  Jam Brewer is nothing but a rhino she is nothing but a rhino she's a go along
[02:19:36.400 --> 02:19:41.520]  person her attack on the illegal alien problem notwithstanding she's a
[02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:45.040]  politician and you were a sheriff in Arizona I know her very well yes you
[02:19:45.040 --> 02:19:48.440]  know her very well we can talk about the border situation as well I want to get

[02:24:22.080 --> 02:24:26.040]  militarization of police and then your phone calls I'm feeling a little bit of
[02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:29.240]  overdrive come on today but I've got us not to overdrive the day because we're
[02:24:29.240 --> 02:24:32.440]  doing the special TV report you know I should have thought about having you
[02:24:32.440 --> 02:24:36.560]  here tonight for the report but who knows we'll see what happens I'm we'll
[02:24:36.560 --> 02:24:39.920]  find out after the show but Sheriff Richard Mack's our guest is a short
[02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:43.360]  segment long segment coming up let's get into militarization of police every
[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:49.680]  week now articles come in usually from the military base itself and Homestead
[02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:53.360]  Air Force Base in Florida is announcing they're now patrolling the town and
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:59.320]  they're making arrest at the Circle K and other events and they could argue
[02:24:59.320 --> 02:25:02.960]  well it's a citizens arrest same power we have but it's active-duty military
[02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:08.040]  doing this Sheriff Mack what's that really about well it's happening all
[02:25:08.040 --> 02:25:11.160]  across the country I don't care where you go and you can see it on YouTube almost
[02:25:11.160 --> 02:25:15.560]  every day where another cop is out of control what these cops are being trained
[02:25:15.560 --> 02:25:20.360]  to do in fact there was one on YouTube I just saw somebody just sent to me and
[02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:26.120]  asked me to look at it and give them some advice the guy just is seeing some
[02:25:26.120 --> 02:25:30.040]  cops go after a lady on a traffic stop and it looked like they were way out of
[02:25:30.040 --> 02:25:33.840]  line you know handcuffing her and all this stuff and he calls him from his
[02:25:33.840 --> 02:25:39.400]  garage from on his property he yells out at the cop you're a Nazi and they come
[02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:42.840]  and arrest him in his garage they come and arrest him on his property and
[02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:48.000]  arrest him yeah you've seen it and I am appalled at stuff like this well what
[02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:51.760]  about when they find a homeless guy who doesn't even resist they beat him for
[02:25:51.760 --> 02:25:55.360]  five minutes and he dies right and the police say that's that's a good killing
[02:25:55.360 --> 02:25:59.600]  yeah I mean this is not about showing off that you're macho and can kill you
[02:25:59.600 --> 02:26:03.880]  know schizophrenic homeless person right and then we have the Jose Garena
[02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:10.160]  shooting in Tucson which I with Oath Keepers went down to that memorial service
[02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:15.840]  and it's just over and over and over and what has happened is we have a SWAT
[02:26:15.840 --> 02:26:20.560]  team mentality and in the book I'm writing right now I have the chapter
[02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:24.520]  dedicated to this and it says don't swap me bro remember the guy that was yelling
[02:26:24.520 --> 02:26:28.720]  don't tase me bro at some you know I can't remember the you know oh University
[02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:32.360]  of Florida no John Kerry's like letting finish his question the cops go no the
[02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:36.200]  guy's going I'm not resisting and they just shocking right exactly that guy I've
[02:26:36.200 --> 02:26:40.640]  got his name and everything it's in my book and it's just it reminds me of
[02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:44.480]  deer hunters to get buck fever when a big buck comes out or they shoot a cow
[02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:47.680]  because they want to kill something it does and it's like well I'm gonna go
[02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:50.600]  ahead and taser you because I want you well well that shooting incident in
[02:26:50.600 --> 02:26:56.040]  Tucson of Jose Garena shows an officer if you look at the tape the SWAT teams
[02:26:56.040 --> 02:27:02.640]  own tape there's three officers at the threshold at the door and they push in
[02:27:02.640 --> 02:27:06.360]  the door and immediately they start shooting you know nothing about drop the
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:11.040]  gun or put it down where the cops put it down you got it you you know we got
[02:27:11.040 --> 02:27:15.760]  you then there's a an officer of the SWAT team about ten feet behind him and
[02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:21.200]  as soon as the shooting starts he rushes to the door has his gun drawn puts it
[02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:26.360]  over the shoulder of another officer and is now having the muzzle blast and he
[02:27:26.360 --> 02:27:30.280]  starts firing empties his gun and fires right next to one of the other
[02:27:30.280 --> 02:27:33.560]  officers face where the muzzle blast is in this guy's face and he was wanting
[02:27:33.560 --> 02:27:36.760]  to get some yeah he wanted to be part he didn't want to be left out of the dance
[02:27:36.760 --> 02:27:42.840]  and that's exactly one of the other kill and this is the mentality that I worry
[02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:46.480]  about that's why you don't want militarized police exactly military kills
[02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:50.280]  people and breaks things exactly and that's what we've done with the SWAT
[02:27:50.280 --> 02:27:54.800]  teams all across this country we have trained these guys that you go home that
[02:27:54.800 --> 02:28:00.080]  you go home them is the most important thing at night and instead of you know
[02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:05.920]  what it may be the worst thing we could do is shooting an innocent person because
[02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:08.960]  that's going to turn the population against him we're already seeing it
[02:28:08.960 --> 02:28:12.720]  starting where citizens are starting to shoot first ask questions later they're
[02:28:12.720 --> 02:28:17.560]  actually escalating it into a war right because of the mentality and what the
[02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:21.760]  cops are doing first of all there should have never been a SWAT team at the
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:26.880]  Jose Guadena home if you want to do serve a warrant on this guy stop him on
[02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:32.120]  the way home have him stay there inform him that he's not allowed to use his
[02:28:32.120 --> 02:28:36.280]  phone take his cell phone away from him inform him that there's going to be a
[02:28:36.280 --> 02:28:39.520]  search warrant served at his house ask him if there's anything that they need
[02:28:39.520 --> 02:28:44.080]  to be aware of in that home and say is your wife armed is she blah blah blah
[02:28:44.080 --> 02:28:47.360]  I mean I mean you're obviously a long time with your law enforcement sheriff
[02:28:47.360 --> 02:28:51.120]  peace officers years so you know all this but just studying criminology in the
[02:28:51.120 --> 02:28:54.280]  old days you always stop somebody when they were leaving home because that was
[02:28:54.280 --> 02:28:57.920]  the safe way safe way you don't go do an armed assault on a house exactly
[02:28:57.920 --> 02:29:01.800]  exactly well why don't they do the old-fashioned thing because these guys
[02:29:01.800 --> 02:29:06.240]  are trained to be mr. macho militarization and they're not trained in
[02:29:06.240 --> 02:29:13.000]  this stuff they're not trained to proceed in logical means and it really has me
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:17.480]  completely baffled why the leadership the sheriffs and you know that's what
[02:29:17.480 --> 02:29:21.720]  I'm doing nationwide I'm reaching out to sheriffs and I believe that we can
[02:29:21.720 --> 02:29:25.880]  change this and and stop it but if we do it's going to be sheriff by sheriff
[02:29:25.880 --> 02:29:28.800]  all right let's continue with that and get into fast and furious but just the
[02:29:28.800 --> 02:29:31.080]  common sense of that if you really think somebody's doing something legal in a
[02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:33.960]  house you know when they're going to work right you just parked down the
[02:29:33.960 --> 02:29:37.880]  street and you follow him to you pull him over nothing happens simple instead of
[02:29:37.880 --> 02:29:43.480]  charging a house or taking down at work well that's like David Koresh you went
[02:29:43.480 --> 02:29:47.840]  into town every day and had a business now they wanted the confrontation yes
[02:29:47.840 --> 02:29:51.880]  exactly they wanted the big macho shootout and they got it we're on the
[02:29:51.880 --> 02:30:01.320]  March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network this is
[02:30:01.320 --> 02:30:04.680]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[02:30:04.680 --> 02:30:08.640]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[02:30:08.640 --> 02:30:12.880]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[02:30:12.880 --> 02:30:17.160]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[02:30:17.160 --> 02:30:21.520]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:30:21.520 --> 02:30:25.600]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:30:25.600 --> 02:30:30.160]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:30:30.160 --> 02:30:34.280]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:30:34.280 --> 02:30:38.280]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[02:30:42.080 --> 02:30:44.800]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[02:33:30.120 --> 02:33:33.280]  in studio with us I'm gonna go to some of your phone calls coming up for people
[02:33:33.280 --> 02:33:40.000]  that are patiently holding the toll free number to join us 800 259 92 31 and
[02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:43.440]  talking to Sheriff Mac you wanted to finish up with something about Waco I
[02:33:43.440 --> 02:33:46.320]  mentioned that it was done as a publicity stunt and you talked about your
[02:33:46.320 --> 02:33:50.960]  lawyer but from your Supreme Court case actually confirmed that it that that is
[02:33:50.960 --> 02:33:55.640]  what that was about it was a staged event no question about it the BATF was
[02:33:55.640 --> 02:34:01.120]  being considered to be scaled down or completely dissolved and abolished and
[02:34:01.120 --> 02:34:06.840]  have the FBI takeover gun enforcement and so the BATF knew that they had to
[02:34:06.840 --> 02:34:11.080]  stage an event that would prompt Congress to not only not get rid of them
[02:34:11.080 --> 02:34:16.400]  but to make them bigger and actually that's what happened the BATF actually
[02:34:16.400 --> 02:34:20.920]  got an increase of money and manpower after the Waco incident they have the
[02:34:20.920 --> 02:34:26.400]  second largest building in DC after the Pentagon BATF does have a gigantic
[02:34:26.400 --> 02:34:29.640]  office building yeah I didn't know that I just finished it like five years ago I
[02:34:29.640 --> 02:34:32.240]  would have guessed the Department of Education but that's another one that
[02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:35.680]  needs to go well it's in a bunch of buildings yeah they have one giant
[02:34:35.680 --> 02:34:40.880]  complex okay see well this is just another example of out of control stupid
[02:34:40.880 --> 02:34:45.240]  government that we have today and the essence of tyranny is the enforcement of
[02:34:45.240 --> 02:34:48.280]  stupid laws and that's what we have going on in our police departments and
[02:34:48.280 --> 02:34:52.480]  federal government all across I would just add the essence is when they write
[02:34:52.480 --> 02:34:56.480]  laws for law abiding citizens look at this article ATF manager says he shared
[02:34:56.480 --> 02:35:01.040]  fast and furious info with White House we posted that C-span video at info
[02:35:01.040 --> 02:35:05.200]  wars.com yesterday but you talk to Larry Pratt he's been at the hearings yeah
[02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:09.880]  and give us the bad news and the good news I mean it's bad news the White House
[02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:14.480]  is this criminal but the good news is if we keep forcing this issue this could
[02:35:14.480 --> 02:35:18.160]  bring them down like Nixon tell us what's happening well I've quite frankly
[02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:22.680]  this this is a bigger scandal than Watergate was and no no question about
[02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:27.040]  it and that's also in my book and the title of my book is the magic of gun
[02:35:27.040 --> 02:35:30.760]  control and this is we're seeing the magic all the time which there isn't
[02:35:30.760 --> 02:35:35.800]  any it's all an illusion and right now we have fast and furious which has
[02:35:35.800 --> 02:35:40.480]  literally been the biggest scandal since the assassination of JFK and the
[02:35:40.480 --> 02:35:44.880]  reason why it has not gotten the play that Watergate got is plain and simply
[02:35:44.880 --> 02:35:50.280]  mainstream media now we have a reporter Atkinson I think his name her name is
[02:35:50.280 --> 02:35:54.360]  Cheryl Atkinson she actually was one of the first to expose this she works for
[02:35:54.360 --> 02:35:57.880]  CBS News. No strangely enough CBS broke it yeah and then the
[02:35:57.880 --> 02:36:02.680]  Justice Department said back off well good ATF did the right job and said
[02:36:02.680 --> 02:36:06.300]  look border patrol been killed they went public with this yeah and then they
[02:36:06.300 --> 02:36:09.560]  said you're liars and it turns out the Attorney General's has his portrait
[02:36:09.560 --> 02:36:14.560]  himself yes and and not only that but they have refused the Congressional
[02:36:14.560 --> 02:36:17.960]  subpoenas which is against the law that's a violation of the law you cannot
[02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:22.400]  refuse that senator Grassley is so frustrated at the response from the
[02:36:22.400 --> 02:36:26.240]  White House and then when they finally get documents that they've been asking
[02:36:26.240 --> 02:36:31.240]  for for weeks they're all blacked out and so and they and they then they
[02:36:31.240 --> 02:36:36.520]  claim national security national security about gun running into Mexico what
[02:36:36.520 --> 02:36:40.800]  is national security we're not at war with Mexico this isn't this isn't any
[02:36:40.800 --> 02:36:44.800]  secret war or anything we're going at what is national security just show the
[02:36:44.800 --> 02:36:49.280]  documents if you need to take an informants name out fine blacked out
[02:36:49.280 --> 02:36:54.440]  out but they're 90% blacked out and so they're nothing and they're completely
[02:36:54.440 --> 02:36:58.160]  and Congress they're the law givers they they represent the people the
[02:36:58.160 --> 02:37:01.320]  executive just like they launched a Libya war without their approval right it's
[02:37:01.320 --> 02:37:04.840]  just doing whatever at once and now it turns out that the head special agent
[02:37:04.840 --> 02:37:09.440]  ATF in charge of Phoenix who and I know it's an oxymoron to say good ATF right
[02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:13.280]  but he said look I'm not gonna do this anymore and this is criminal and it
[02:37:13.280 --> 02:37:16.960]  turns out he's told the truth and he testified that the White House did know
[02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:22.160]  well of course now we know the FBI and DEA were involved yes and Agent Dodson
[02:37:22.160 --> 02:37:25.440]  from the Phoenix office was actually the first one to break this whole thing
[02:37:25.440 --> 02:37:32.600]  he exposed it to Atkinson and so this is the a gigantic story but you
[02:37:32.600 --> 02:37:37.480]  need to understand this is our own federal government running guns into
[02:37:37.480 --> 02:37:40.720]  Mexico and the reason they said they were doing it is so they could trace the
[02:37:40.720 --> 02:37:45.120]  guns into the cartels the only way you can trace a gun into a cartel is if it
[02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:50.120]  has a GPS unit there was only two guns with GPS units so they couldn't trace
[02:37:50.120 --> 02:37:54.760]  them anyway so they had to know that they were going to be used in gun
[02:37:54.760 --> 02:38:00.160]  violence and then agent Brian Terry working for the Border Patrol is shot
[02:38:00.160 --> 02:38:05.440]  and killed his family starts asking for answers and then Dodson starts telling
[02:38:05.440 --> 02:38:10.880]  the truth from the BATF office in Phoenix exposing his own department his own
[02:38:10.880 --> 02:38:15.040]  office for the corruption of running these guns down to Mexico and you need
[02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:19.040]  to know every one of your listeners at you need to absolutely know what this
[02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:24.440]  was is have you ever heard Barack Obama get up and say even since the Gifford
[02:38:24.440 --> 02:38:29.240]  shooting in Tucson where Judge Roll was killed even if even since then you have
[02:38:29.240 --> 02:38:33.240]  not heard even at the memorial service you have not heard Barack Obama say we've
[02:38:33.240 --> 02:38:38.360]  got to have more gun control you know he's a gun control fanatic everybody
[02:38:38.360 --> 02:38:43.440]  he has Eric Holder everybody in his cabinet our anti-second amendment they
[02:38:43.440 --> 02:38:48.800]  want to do this this was their way of promoting and making sure gun control
[02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:52.480]  would become a second and by the way there's total proof it turns out a year
[02:38:52.480 --> 02:38:55.840]  ago and I was already talking about this at the time they put out press releases
[02:38:55.840 --> 02:39:00.640]  Holder came to Texas Arizona and Mexico California and gave speeches saying the
[02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:04.800]  crime in Mexico is because of US guns right they know they're shipping and
[02:39:04.800 --> 02:39:09.400]  and that and that's how they but now it came out in the Miami papers and others
[02:39:09.400 --> 02:39:13.600]  that they're shipping them into Miami to go to Honduras right and so this is a
[02:39:13.600 --> 02:39:18.080]  lot bigger it's a lot bigger and it's again a lot worse than Watergate but if
[02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:22.200]  we would only get the media now who do we have really attacking this we have Fox
[02:39:22.200 --> 02:39:28.840]  News you gun owners of America and we still don't have the mainstream newspapers
[02:39:28.840 --> 02:39:34.280]  or NBC even CBS who broke this has backed off and pulled back now and they act
[02:39:34.280 --> 02:39:38.760]  like it's you know Kit gloves here for some reason so if the if the media if
[02:39:38.760 --> 02:39:42.240]  the national media really went after this this would have already destroyed
[02:39:42.240 --> 02:39:46.880]  the presidency of Barack Obama because all of this was an attempt to promote
[02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:52.640]  backdoor gun control in America and destroy the Second Amendment that's all
[02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:57.800]  what this was about it was a political ploy by the White House by this justice
[02:39:57.800 --> 02:40:02.400]  we've had the ATF in Austin Cindy Legals in the gun shows you know 90 plus
[02:40:02.400 --> 02:40:06.160]  percenter dealers but private people if I want to go sell one of my guns I can
[02:40:06.160 --> 02:40:10.000]  walk in with it and sell it they they want to shut that down so you can't give
[02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.920]  your grandson a gun or you can't buy your dad a gun I bought my dad a gun
[02:40:12.920 --> 02:40:18.040]  before he's bought me a gun before many guns when I was young and so so so they
[02:40:18.040 --> 02:40:21.560]  can actually register and track everything right and we've caught them
[02:40:21.560 --> 02:40:26.680]  all over the country they Cindy Legals in to buy it from some grandpa then they
[02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:30.600]  arrest the grandpa in the parking lot and shut the gun show down Mayor
[02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:35.400]  Bloomberg sent his own officers from New York City to a gun show in Phoenix to do
[02:40:35.400 --> 02:40:39.440]  the same thing and he did that to Bob Templeton of the crossroads of the West
[02:40:39.440 --> 02:40:43.400]  gun shows so it's not the feds out of their jurisdiction now it's Mr. Gunn
[02:40:43.400 --> 02:40:48.400]  Van Bloomberg right exactly a Republican you know yeah and so yeah it's
[02:40:48.400 --> 02:40:52.440]  good it's getting so crazy out there people think we make this stuff up
[02:40:52.440 --> 02:40:57.000]  Alex you know truth is stranger than fiction and folks every bit of this is
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:03.840]  documented and I think I really believe that this is going to destroy the
[02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:07.360]  Obama administration well you said you talked to Pratt and he and it's been
[02:41:07.360 --> 02:41:11.200]  confirmed it goes right up to Obama who is a state senator called for I've read
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:14.720]  the quotes complete abolition of the Second Amendment of course that's that's
[02:41:14.720 --> 02:41:18.800]  been their goal they've just had to they know that there isn't congressional
[02:41:18.800 --> 02:41:23.480]  support for it they know that there isn't American support for gun control so
[02:41:23.480 --> 02:41:28.160]  they had to fabricate another way to do it just like he fabricated the health
[02:41:28.160 --> 02:41:34.440]  care crisis to bring in his Obama care that is how this man moves he is a
[02:41:34.440 --> 02:41:40.240]  subterfuse specialist and he is the one that has made this an agenda to make
[02:41:40.240 --> 02:41:46.200]  sure that they created enough ire and enough public outcry for gun but I do
[02:41:46.200 --> 02:41:50.520]  find it encouraging that that the ATF people actually started blowing the
[02:41:50.520 --> 02:41:53.800]  whistle of course good people this proves there are good people in
[02:41:53.800 --> 02:41:58.200]  government and if there weren't I'd be out of a job tomorrow I wouldn't have a
[02:41:58.200 --> 02:42:02.760]  a goal and a purpose in what I'm doing I'd love to be out of this job me too
[02:42:02.760 --> 02:42:05.880]  let's work ourselves out of a job we'd live in a free country that's exactly
[02:42:05.880 --> 02:42:10.680]  what I'm after I've told my wife and kids I'd love well people ask me why do
[02:42:10.680 --> 02:42:15.000]  you get so upset why do you work so hard at an instinctive level I get chills
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:19.200]  talking about it being a slave having my guns taken having a government that
[02:42:19.200 --> 02:42:23.400]  can raise taxes to destroy my future to have these corrupt interests selling our
[02:42:23.400 --> 02:42:27.800]  jobs out I mean you'd be crazy to not constantly work against this I mean
[02:42:27.800 --> 02:42:31.760]  people think we're like heroes because we fight tyranny that's what you're not
[02:42:31.760 --> 02:42:34.880]  going to have freedom if you don't fight tyranny it's an eternal battle I mean
[02:42:34.880 --> 02:42:38.960]  why do you fight corruption well it's about freedom and liberty and that's why
[02:42:38.960 --> 02:42:46.240]  I owe it to my kids and my grandkids and if if I'm free and you're not then I'm
[02:42:46.240 --> 02:42:49.120]  not free when you're with your grandkids because there's this sweet little
[02:42:49.120 --> 02:42:51.680]  innocent toddlers I don't know if they're that a yeah they are well my
[02:42:51.680 --> 02:42:55.840]  children every time I'm reading to my little daughter she's almost four I live
[02:42:55.840 --> 02:42:59.800]  when they're little she's so sweet and she's so innocent and good all I'm
[02:42:59.800 --> 02:43:02.360]  thinking about is we've got to beat the new world order we've got to beat the
[02:43:02.360 --> 02:43:05.640]  new world exactly exactly and the corruption that's in government is
[02:43:05.640 --> 02:43:09.880]  something that I cannot tolerate and I won't and I believe that there's a lot
[02:43:09.880 --> 02:43:13.920]  of good sheriffs out there that will join us in this great cause and I'm
[02:43:13.920 --> 02:43:17.480]  asking your listeners to join us in that great cause I need support I need help
[02:43:17.480 --> 02:43:23.000]  with this I'm doing as much as I can and I'm traveling and I'm almost exhausted
[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:27.880]  but the traveling how is it to to to reach out to juries grand juries and
[02:43:27.880 --> 02:43:31.160]  sheriffs and to take the states back for those that don't know the founders
[02:43:31.160 --> 02:43:35.720]  built this in as a balance of power against an out-of-control federal
[02:43:35.720 --> 02:43:40.040]  government well the the sheriff is actually vital in every bit of that
[02:43:40.040 --> 02:43:43.880]  state sovereignty is still something the sheriff should be very concerned about
[02:43:43.880 --> 02:43:49.360]  they need to be enforcing that juries absolutely yes but the bottom line is
[02:43:49.360 --> 02:43:54.360]  the sheriff will determine what is and what is not enforced in your county and
[02:43:54.360 --> 02:43:59.280]  so we take back America sheriff by sheriff county by county state by state
[02:43:59.280 --> 02:44:03.720]  we make the federal government irrelevant the corruption coming out of
[02:44:03.720 --> 02:44:07.840]  Washington DC and I'm going to tell you right now the small arms ban that the
[02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:11.760]  United Nations is trying to work out with Hillary Clinton right now there
[02:44:11.760 --> 02:44:15.840]  isn't anything that the UN and the federal government are trying to do to
[02:44:15.840 --> 02:44:22.680]  us that the sheriffs can't stop exactly when they couldn't get Congress to pass
[02:44:22.680 --> 02:44:26.760]  the carbon taxes they had Obama do it executively and then they admitted the
[02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:30.000]  Copenhagen meeting two years ago led by Schwarzenegger we're going to go to the
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:34.080]  cities and do it and they marched into Austin San Francisco and other cities and
[02:44:34.080 --> 02:44:40.240]  put carbon taxes on us yeah I mean these are lawless scumbag criminals right
[02:44:40.240 --> 02:44:48.360]  and if there was nothing more evident of that then just look at the process going
[02:44:48.360 --> 02:44:53.120]  on right now the sausage being grinded out through this ridiculous economic
[02:44:53.120 --> 02:44:58.680]  process what you can know for certain with all of this looking at 14.5 trillion
[02:44:58.680 --> 02:45:03.320]  in debt and our obligations up to about 90 trillion dollars what you can know is
[02:45:03.320 --> 02:45:09.120]  that every bit of that was thievery corruption and your government at work
[02:45:09.120 --> 02:45:15.680]  at its worst and that's why this we have got to find a way to make a Washington
[02:45:15.680 --> 02:45:22.160]  DC irrelevant financially economically and socially and the sheriffs and the
[02:45:22.160 --> 02:45:25.880]  state governments can do that you get governors and sheriffs working together
[02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:29.760]  on this holy cause of liberty we'll get freedom back tomorrow and that's why
[02:45:29.760 --> 02:45:32.520]  they're set up the rural councils the governor's councils the mayor's
[02:45:32.520 --> 02:45:36.760]  councils they fly them all up there those that are totes get put on special
[02:45:36.760 --> 02:45:40.520]  boards and then get more federal money I mean this is just how the Soviets
[02:45:40.520 --> 02:45:44.560]  control their satellites the system they're setting up I want to go to some
[02:45:44.560 --> 02:45:48.160]  phone calls for Sheriff Richard Mack here today Jeff and Louisiana you're on
[02:45:48.160 --> 02:45:51.080]  the air welcome sir
[02:45:52.640 --> 02:46:00.080]  hey Jeff how you doing hey yes welcome you're on the air I just wanted to say
[02:46:00.080 --> 02:46:04.880]  thanks for everything and um yeah I worked with no PD I'm in the National
[02:46:04.880 --> 02:46:10.160]  Guard and I worked with the New Orleans Police Department for three years at the
[02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:13.440]  hurricane Katrina which I'm sure you know it was all over the news everybody
[02:46:13.440 --> 02:46:20.040]  knows about and um the gun confiscation well I'm gonna know not that it was I'm
[02:46:20.040 --> 02:46:23.600]  saying the first chance the feds had they did it they said we're not bringing
[02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:26.920]  food and water we're coming into the neighborhood and take your guns but go
[02:46:26.920 --> 02:46:30.880]  ahead and make your point sir sorry no it was just going along with everything
[02:46:30.880 --> 02:46:35.440]  you're saying about federalizing police and you know the military to work with
[02:46:35.440 --> 02:46:41.360]  the with the police but um I don't know exactly what is going on with the NOPD
[02:46:41.360 --> 02:46:47.000]  but they are federalized now so I don't know if you know who's working with them
[02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:53.200]  but they may be trying to well New Orleans New Orleans and OPD has had
[02:46:53.200 --> 02:46:58.520]  problems way before Katrina and they've been very corrupt I've followed that
[02:46:58.520 --> 02:47:04.080]  one of for the last 15 years and their their corruption there has been wide
[02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:07.920]  spread and very well known and man if they had probably the cops in a Walmart
[02:47:07.920 --> 02:47:11.520]  steal and everything oh yeah sure and that and they thought it was fine you
[02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:14.280]  know they're being interviewed while they're doing it you know that that's
[02:47:14.280 --> 02:47:19.400]  typical of how far gone New Orleans PD is gone what about New York PD I have
[02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:22.680]  footage where they go up to peaceful activists protesting with permits and
[02:47:22.680 --> 02:47:26.400]  say leave or we're gonna say you have bombs they go we don't have bombs they
[02:47:26.400 --> 02:47:30.040]  go well we know you don't put you in jail for bombs and then they let them go
[02:47:30.040 --> 02:47:34.480]  with tape yeah say I mean that's a felony a cop saying I'm gonna say you got
[02:47:34.480 --> 02:47:39.440]  a bomb yeah I mean that that shows total criminal confidence of course of
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:44.880]  course and and we've got to have a way to combat that and I believe we do and
[02:47:44.880 --> 02:47:49.360]  we have some great sheriffs even back in New York we've got some great sheriffs
[02:47:49.360 --> 02:47:54.640]  that are coming on board because they're elected anything else caller
[02:47:54.880 --> 02:47:59.400]  all right Jeff I appreciate your call me it's such common sense that that that
[02:47:59.400 --> 02:48:04.160]  that the the police in your area are under state law and they they're elected
[02:48:04.160 --> 02:48:08.960]  by you I mean and then the sheriffs you know it is actually going out to
[02:48:08.960 --> 02:48:12.120]  criminals and pretend and working with the citizens and I mean they need more
[02:48:12.120 --> 02:48:17.320]  help get your guns boys we got we got a guy on the loose I mean my mother
[02:48:17.320 --> 02:48:22.760]  growing up in Hyde Park in Austin Texas the state hospitals like a mile away and
[02:48:22.760 --> 02:48:27.520]  they routinely would have the police come through and and my grandpa would go
[02:48:27.520 --> 02:48:31.400]  out and they'd say hey get your rifles you know you know we got a dangerous
[02:48:31.400 --> 02:48:36.040]  violent nut that sound help us or if there was a rabid dog that they just go
[02:48:36.040 --> 02:48:39.280]  out in the middle awesome just shoot it or when you have the tower shooting all
[02:48:39.280 --> 02:48:42.880]  the citizens with their guns look at how much we've changed since then we have
[02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:47.960]  changed and in we keep sliding down like judge Bort says sliding down to
[02:48:47.960 --> 02:48:51.760]  Gamora with his book and that's exactly what's happening in our country and we
[02:48:51.760 --> 02:48:55.280]  have got to take our mayor America back and there is a place to do it there
[02:48:55.280 --> 02:49:00.000]  still is a place for hope and liberty and freedom in this country and it's in
[02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:04.840]  your county and county by county we can do yeah we get 60% turnouts on average
[02:49:04.840 --> 02:49:10.320]  for presidential 8.2 on average for county and city folks take your city
[02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:14.580]  back get aggressive the time let's go to Josh in North Carolina than Ron and
[02:49:14.580 --> 02:49:18.640]  Bill Josh you're on the air go ahead we're going Alex I listen to you all the
[02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:21.960]  time but not for the reason I think a lot of other people do I listen because I
[02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:25.800]  think half the people who call in your show are completely nuts and I don't
[02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:28.880]  think they're as informed as they should be in a perfect example is one of your
[02:49:28.880 --> 02:49:32.920]  last callers who called and said oh I'm military and I told my Marines hey you
[02:49:32.920 --> 02:49:36.560]  you don't defend the president you don't you defend the Constitution only well
[02:49:36.560 --> 02:49:40.880]  he's blatantly wrong every enlisted member of the military swears to the
[02:49:40.880 --> 02:49:44.520]  Constitution and the president of the United States the only people who don't
[02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:49.520]  are officers and we were put in that position so that in case a usurper took
[02:49:49.520 --> 02:49:53.560]  over office we wouldn't have allegiance to him and we could take him over and
[02:49:53.560 --> 02:49:57.560]  but yet this guy is is trying to make you know but expanding on that I mean
[02:49:57.560 --> 02:50:00.400]  expanding on that they've tried to change the oath just to the president
[02:50:00.400 --> 02:50:05.960]  that's what Hitler did you know you're given those those those rules and
[02:50:05.960 --> 02:50:09.760]  you're given the military rules and you're not to follow an illegal or
[02:50:09.760 --> 02:50:13.400]  unawful order so what does military do when they're ordered to go help run
[02:50:13.400 --> 02:50:18.040]  checkpoints with the police yeah I think and then some people are looking at
[02:50:18.040 --> 02:50:21.480]  this as something else one of your other callers said well I trained with with
[02:50:21.480 --> 02:50:25.600]  foreign military and foreign police and that just really creeped me out we do
[02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:28.840]  that all the time that's no secret I've been in the Marine Corps for 15 years
[02:50:28.840 --> 02:50:33.040]  Josh Josh Josh I know about training with foreign troops they have signed

[02:50:38.480 --> 02:50:43.760]  of that yeah and we you know it because we get a theater cooperation with all of
[02:50:43.760 --> 02:50:48.240]  these other people and we try to keep good terms with every country stay there
[02:50:48.240 --> 02:50:52.120]  stay there I understand you know it all and I'm glad to finally have somebody on

[02:54:44.800 --> 02:54:50.520]  before it was to defend and protect the Constitution but they have gotten rid of
[02:54:50.520 --> 02:54:54.840]  that and but let me ask the caller because I want to just cut right down to
[02:54:54.840 --> 02:54:58.680]  where you stand Josh are you saying everything's fine the fact that they've
[02:54:58.680 --> 02:55:02.760]  got signed deals to use quote Mexican and Canadian troops inside the US to
[02:55:02.760 --> 02:55:06.000]  quote fight terrorism and for other disasters and I can pull that up for
[02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:10.080]  you and maybe Katrina with a gun confiscation that didn't happen or maybe
[02:55:10.080 --> 02:55:14.640]  it was needed or or because you're saying that we're the other callers are a
[02:55:14.640 --> 02:55:20.560]  bunch of idiots and I spell it out for us in part to us the knowledge here I
[02:55:20.560 --> 02:55:23.640]  mean is it bad that Obama's launching a war in Libya without congressional
[02:55:23.640 --> 02:55:27.960]  approval I mean are we wrong to be upset here I don't think you're wrong to be
[02:55:27.960 --> 02:55:31.720]  upset but I will say if everything's a conspiracy then nothing's a conspiracy
[02:55:31.720 --> 02:55:35.520]  everything can't have a double meaning and I think a lot of people want
[02:55:35.520 --> 02:55:38.920]  everything to have a secret meaning it's that everybody's evil I know you do
[02:55:38.920 --> 02:55:42.840]  that your whole bohemian grove thing and all that stuff but we still listen I've
[02:55:42.840 --> 02:55:46.960]  been to the urban warfare drills where the participants are playing the parts
[02:55:46.960 --> 02:55:51.680]  of Americans then I've had Marines and Army walk up to me in Texas and say
[02:55:51.680 --> 02:55:55.000]  turn your camera off when they're doing a takeover drill of the town and
[02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:59.600]  threaten me and I'm talking about anyway people with guns so and I have to
[02:55:59.600 --> 02:56:02.920]  tell them no in fact I never even got the clip earlier we're in New York troops
[02:56:02.920 --> 02:56:07.360]  run across the street with guns and start threatening me and I've and I've had
[02:56:07.360 --> 02:56:11.520]  Jag officers and retired people generals on and they say the way policy
[02:56:11.520 --> 02:56:15.600]  commentators is written this is illegal and it's being ignored is it okay to have
[02:56:15.600 --> 02:56:19.880]  loaded guns on their side hips threatening me not to videotape them in
[02:56:19.880 --> 02:56:23.240]  New York and you know that they're loaded you said that they're 45 we've
[02:56:23.240 --> 02:56:26.560]  been carried 45 I know they carry Barrettas I know they carry Barrettas hey
[02:56:26.560 --> 02:56:30.800]  these guys had 45s and I got footage in fact did Rob ever bring that into you I
[02:56:30.800 --> 02:56:35.080]  told him to bring that in it's in in game okay I told Jacobson two hours ago in
[02:56:35.080 --> 02:56:40.400]  there to send you the the video clip online what call Jacobson in here what
[02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:45.640]  caliber I'm elevator did you see what caliber do they carry Josh Josh he said
[02:56:45.640 --> 02:56:49.200]  that they were carrying 45 but I happen to know but I happen to know it's not
[02:56:49.200 --> 02:56:55.240]  it's nine millimeter Beretta isn't it okay but you yeah they had 45s they had
[02:56:55.240 --> 02:57:00.040]  45s okay so you saw their military ID and you know 100% that these guys are
[02:57:00.040 --> 02:57:02.960]  legit military even though they don't carry our standard issue weapon they can
[02:57:02.960 --> 02:57:07.920]  just carry whatever they want oh now I'm having delusions about white vans I'm
[02:57:07.920 --> 02:57:13.520]  just saying is you you said they were carrying a weapon we don't carry so there
[02:57:13.520 --> 02:57:17.680]  you go okay well I'm glad everything's okay and they got government and there's
[02:57:17.680 --> 02:57:22.200]  no inflation I'm sure everything's fine hey you know everybody's got difficulties
[02:57:22.200 --> 02:57:25.600]  but when you say something that's wrong I just don't think that everybody just
[02:57:25.600 --> 02:57:28.400]  rolled it like we have the largest recruitment thing in Mexico City you
[02:57:28.400 --> 02:57:31.800]  said that where's the proof of that there's a marina that in the Washington
[02:57:31.800 --> 02:57:36.040]  Post five years ago I've worked in recruiting we don't recruit in Mexico
[02:57:36.040 --> 02:57:40.880]  City in fact in 2003 an army recruiter crossed the border into Mexico and he
[02:57:40.880 --> 02:57:44.920]  got in a huge amount of trouble because we don't do that as the BATF run guns
[02:57:44.920 --> 02:57:49.520]  down to Mexico does I don't I don't work for the BATF so I wouldn't know you
[02:57:49.520 --> 02:57:52.480]  haven't seen those reports and you think that's all a conspiracy thing when
[02:57:52.480 --> 02:58:01.520]  agent Dotson reported it a BATF agent reported that it's this stuff isn't
[02:58:01.520 --> 02:58:05.800]  made up truth is strangers hey celly Castile told us on this show six years
[02:58:05.800 --> 02:58:09.560]  ago that they were shipping guns into Mexico and it was the ATF yeah and then
[02:58:09.560 --> 02:58:13.320]  it all came true yeah but listen sir you notice when you had that pleasure
[02:58:13.320 --> 02:58:19.480]  moment and so they we don't carry 45s I said nine millimeter barrettas I said
[02:58:19.480 --> 02:58:24.520]  45s because that's what they looked like to me okay well you obviously knew they
[02:58:24.520 --> 02:58:30.360]  carried nine mm no the thing is they I saw the whole groups I saw big giant 45
[02:58:30.360 --> 02:58:34.480]  I thought that was weird it's easy to see the difference I don't know why okay
[02:58:34.480 --> 02:58:38.440]  and the point is is the 45s and I think some have barrettas as well I got the

[03:00:35.280 --> 03:00:41.480]  video in about you know a year or this particular part and actually I also
[03:00:41.480 --> 03:00:45.080]  watch all the raw footage we shoot and all mixes together I remember on this
[03:00:45.080 --> 03:00:49.880]  same trip talking to people so now may have been in the subway marveling that's
[03:00:49.880 --> 03:00:54.920]  a 45 and it looked like stainless steel and all high-tech and I was going that's
[03:00:54.920 --> 03:00:59.200]  not a Beretta 9 millimeter I mean I'm a gun guy not so much in the last decade
[03:00:59.200 --> 03:01:03.000]  as I'm always working but I mean I like guns okay good thing I did because the
[03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:07.360]  15 or 20 guns I bought back when I was in you know 25 years old they're all
[03:01:07.360 --> 03:01:11.760]  like doubled in value or more but I'm gonna play this clip and of course he's
[03:01:11.760 --> 03:01:15.120]  saying maybe these aren't even military personnel well folks watching on
[03:01:15.120 --> 03:01:18.720]  prismplanet.tv and later this will be our kind of the Alex Jones channel for
[03:01:18.720 --> 03:01:22.360]  everybody free on YouTube tell me are these real military personnel right
[03:01:22.360 --> 03:01:50.680]  here here it is
[03:01:50.680 --> 03:02:17.480]  well I did check their ID
[03:02:17.480 --> 03:02:20.640]  Josh says you gotta check their ID you asked what are those guys
[03:02:20.640 --> 03:02:24.280]  for their ID and see what's gonna happen to you yeah demand to show the
[03:02:24.280 --> 03:02:27.920]  military ID and they've got to show it now Josh you caught us it's all not real
[03:02:27.920 --> 03:02:32.640]  you know folks said it wasn't real when I had the Coronado land on tape with the
[03:02:32.640 --> 03:02:37.120]  hovercraft and the Marines and foreign troops training to take out Americans on
[03:02:37.120 --> 03:02:42.680]  video and people said that's fake he hired those ships yeah I mean that was
[03:02:42.680 --> 03:02:48.160]  2006 yeah that was 2006 right there in New York why were they there there were
[03:02:48.160 --> 03:02:52.200]  military everywhere you drive by there'd be police in the black uniforms of the
[03:02:52.200 --> 03:02:56.480]  German why are they there they were like searching bags in the subway everything
[03:02:56.480 --> 03:03:00.880]  and they all had 45s and Beretta's hanging on them and I remember going why
[03:03:00.880 --> 03:03:04.560]  are you carrying a 45 they would just go you know not gonna answer your question
[03:03:04.560 --> 03:03:09.160]  and I don't know well I'll tell you most people in law enforcement didn't like
[03:03:09.160 --> 03:03:13.440]  the 9mm they don't have enough firepower and for the military to say oh
[03:03:13.440 --> 03:03:17.560]  we're just gonna use 9mm they don't have very much firepower didn't have very
[03:03:17.560 --> 03:03:22.440]  much knockdown power I know 45s got knocked down but penetration wise isn't
[03:03:22.440 --> 03:03:27.880]  something like a you know the Sig 40 or a 40 cal aren't those good I would
[03:03:27.880 --> 03:03:32.960]  rather have the Sig 40 that personally but when the chips are down most cops
[03:03:32.960 --> 03:03:36.960]  want their shotguns oh yeah that'll get the job done you know I have to worry
[03:03:36.960 --> 03:03:41.520]  about aiming too much either alright Josh you caught us I want to admit it you
[03:03:41.520 --> 03:03:44.480]  caught me those aren't real military you caught me they weren't either in New
[03:03:44.480 --> 03:03:48.260]  Orleans taking guns all the guns will be taken no will be allowed to be armed are
[03:03:48.260 --> 03:03:51.680]  you saying we're making that up I don't agree with everything you say Alex but
[03:03:51.680 --> 03:03:54.560]  I'll tell you you know I made an oath to the Constitution and I will always
[03:03:54.560 --> 03:03:58.600]  defend your right to say it no matter if I agree with it or not but if I hear
[03:03:58.600 --> 03:04:01.440]  something wrong I do feel compelled to correct somebody like your ran
[03:04:01.440 --> 03:04:05.480]  corporation statue ran it was completely wrong or hearing something
[03:04:05.480 --> 03:04:08.520]  about we have the largest recruitment center in Mexico City that's just wrong
[03:04:08.520 --> 03:04:11.800]  I don't think people should check you on it you're the one who's always telling
[03:04:11.800 --> 03:04:15.040]  people go to Google go look up this information so then when they go ahead
[03:04:15.040 --> 03:04:18.400]  and do it and find you to be wrong they should call you and tell you that well
[03:04:18.400 --> 03:04:22.240]  hold on hold on I mean I go for memory on a lot of stuff but I remember it's
[03:04:22.240 --> 03:04:25.560]  probably five years ago there were a bunch of articles where they were opening
[03:04:25.560 --> 03:04:32.720]  them in it was a list of recruiting centers and and and they may be recruiting
[03:04:32.720 --> 03:04:36.920]  them and getting them up here to the US but it was in Ukraine it was in Mexico
[03:04:36.920 --> 03:04:41.840]  City I remember this are you saying that one of the biggest recruitment drives
[03:04:41.840 --> 03:04:46.200]  isn't to get non-US citizens join the military that's not what you said you
[03:04:46.200 --> 03:04:49.520]  didn't say a recruitment drive you said we have recruitment centers in Mexico
[03:04:49.520 --> 03:04:52.840]  City yeah that's that's what the Washington post I got a great man
[03:04:52.840 --> 03:04:56.760]  we'll see if I'm exactly right I'm gonna search it during the break we'll see

[03:08:44.400 --> 03:08:48.040]  already always told people this check what I say because I go from memory on
[03:08:48.040 --> 03:08:54.080]  a lot of stuff and so I try to tell the truth and I know I'm right but I searched
[03:08:54.080 --> 03:09:04.080]  U.S. recruiting outside of U.S. and I got 2k.army.mil.faqs.htm and it says we
[03:09:04.080 --> 03:09:08.480]  do not recruit outside of the United States and are barred from doing so I
[03:09:08.480 --> 03:09:12.080]  think you can show me a document cam shot I'll show them this but I just sent
[03:09:12.080 --> 03:09:15.480]  Aaron Dykes I'll probably end up having it tomorrow out to do a deep search so
[03:09:15.480 --> 03:09:20.080]  something's five six years old I can't remember the exact headline and it said
[03:09:20.080 --> 03:09:23.360]  that they had set up their biggest recruiting centers the headline was
[03:09:23.360 --> 03:09:28.040]  something like biggest U.S. recruiting outside U.S. I think that's what'll find
[03:09:28.040 --> 03:09:32.200]  it now so I'm starting to percolate and it may be I'm just going from memory here
[03:09:32.200 --> 03:09:35.600]  like they've set up private recruiting arms I remember in the article it says
[03:09:35.600 --> 03:09:39.680]  they recruit them fly I'm here to enlist but but no one denies that they're
[03:09:39.680 --> 03:09:43.240]  filling the military with foreigners I mean I mean that's not denied but but
[03:09:43.240 --> 03:09:46.960]  the point is I did go look up what he's saying he says he is a recruiter so yes
[03:09:46.960 --> 03:09:51.280]  you individually must be barred but I know my memory I remember Washington Post
[03:09:51.280 --> 03:09:55.080]  and you watch I'm gonna make sure I don't forget we're gonna find it and I'm
[03:09:55.080 --> 03:09:58.800]  gonna cover it here sorry Sheriff Mack go ahead no that's all right but even he
[03:09:58.800 --> 03:10:02.760]  the caller said that they do outside recruiting they just he said he didn't
[03:10:02.760 --> 03:10:07.880]  believe there was a recruiting center in Mexico but they'd know even admitted
[03:10:07.880 --> 03:10:11.860]  that's all lawyer talk I remember them saying their biggest recruiting was in
[03:10:11.860 --> 03:10:16.480]  Mexico City in Ukraine sure I remember it saying recruiting centers well he
[03:10:16.480 --> 03:10:20.000]  doesn't deny it happens he just wants he doesn't believe there's a building that's
[03:10:20.000 --> 03:10:23.680]  the biggest building in Mexico City for recruiting but this is a lot of double
[03:10:23.680 --> 03:10:29.640]  thinking that's exactly because I mean the point is they're recruiting in foreign
[03:10:29.640 --> 03:10:33.080]  countries that's the point well in fact I should have gone back to him is he
[03:10:33.080 --> 03:10:36.520]  still there because I think he was kind of making excuses for foreign troops it
[03:10:36.520 --> 03:10:41.120]  well we have forced assistance agreements no you don't bring foreign troops in
[03:10:41.120 --> 03:10:46.520]  here they're not supposed to you heard him say that is he still there it a
[03:10:46.520 --> 03:10:50.360]  sir tell us your view on foreign troops being used because I know I can pull that
[03:10:50.360 --> 03:10:53.640]  up a whole bunch of articles where they've signed agreements to use foreign
[03:10:53.640 --> 03:10:58.040]  troops in America well when I was sheriff we had you in troops in Arizona
[03:10:58.040 --> 03:11:02.480]  oh you're just making that up everything's fine what was that caller's name
[03:11:02.480 --> 03:11:07.600]  here Josh what's your view on foreign troops to be used against the American
[03:11:07.600 --> 03:11:11.000]  people I don't think I think you're saying that they're going to be used
[03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:13.880]  against the American people that's fear mongering that's saying well I know what
[03:11:13.880 --> 03:11:17.360]  they're going to do nothing not going to be you know sir it's in my film road to
[03:11:17.360 --> 03:11:22.040]  tyranny the screenshot of Reuters saying they've signed a deal to use foreign
[03:11:22.040 --> 03:11:25.640]  troops in the US and then last year Congress and the Canadian Parliament got
[03:11:25.640 --> 03:11:28.320]  mad because they announced we're going to use each other's troops and they use
[03:11:28.320 --> 03:11:34.840]  US troops at the at the at the the Olympics up there I know we use that
[03:11:34.840 --> 03:11:38.640]  use against them that wasn't using a bad way we use foreign troops here all the
[03:11:38.640 --> 03:11:42.920]  time why not why you're not even supposed to use regular military for
[03:11:42.920 --> 03:11:47.960]  policing citizens are you for that yeah absolutely if we need them oh my
[03:11:47.960 --> 03:11:52.040]  goodness sir that's the law that's posse common taught us the I mean you guys
[03:11:52.040 --> 03:11:56.040]  may ignore it at the TSA may ignore the Tenth Amendment but you're not supposed
[03:11:56.040 --> 03:12:01.320]  to be doing it a lot of things have changed over the last decade you better
[03:12:01.320 --> 03:12:04.160]  believe a lot of stuff yeah this country's going to hell in a handbag more
[03:12:04.160 --> 03:12:08.520]  corruption that's the difference between us you're afraid of everything and you
[03:12:08.520 --> 03:12:11.600]  just think that everything is going down the toilet and there's absolutely no
[03:12:11.600 --> 03:12:16.240]  redeeming value to anything we do but I don't I look at the the pops you're an
[03:12:16.240 --> 03:12:21.240]  officer are you an officer I've built both actually you're on a power trip you
[03:12:21.240 --> 03:12:26.320]  know absolutely not the incredible footage in Houston and Denver of them
[03:12:26.320 --> 03:12:29.640]  lying to teenage kids saying you'll go to jail if you don't come sign this
[03:12:29.640 --> 03:12:33.800]  paperwork and then they were they promoted the recruiters who lie and
[03:12:33.800 --> 03:12:37.440]  threaten kids do you ever do stuff like that when you're a really never never
[03:12:37.440 --> 03:12:40.680]  that do I have I heard cases about it absolutely and those recruiters are
[03:12:40.680 --> 03:12:46.280]  prosecuted and I've seen it happen because I've seen recruits promoted you
[03:12:46.280 --> 03:12:52.560]  you I've had enough of you I appreciate the call as soon as he told us foreign
[03:12:52.560 --> 03:12:55.800]  troops you know and and and yeah the military if we need them use them on
[03:12:55.800 --> 03:12:59.840]  the streets but but to say that there's no problem with that is the concern I
[03:12:59.840 --> 03:13:04.680]  have he admits that they're here and when I go ten years ago he denied that
[03:13:04.680 --> 03:13:11.080]  yeah but when I wrote my first book of back in 1994 from my cold-dead fingers
[03:13:11.080 --> 03:13:17.480]  it has in there that 5,000 Chinese troops were here in America and the
[03:13:17.480 --> 03:13:21.680]  question was why why the cooperative nugget footage you know we're far in
[03:13:21.680 --> 03:13:26.280]  Eastern Europeans train against American role players in towns that look like the
[03:13:26.280 --> 03:13:30.120]  US but the real reason that if you came up with the answer was because they're
[03:13:30.120 --> 03:13:35.240]  not bound by our Constitution they're not bound by any oath and they will just
[03:13:35.240 --> 03:13:41.120]  follow orders sheriff everybody knows that the Russians would train from
[03:13:41.120 --> 03:13:46.400]  Eastern Russia 3,000 miles over to Western Russia to use it on a crowd the
[03:13:46.400 --> 03:13:50.000]  Chinese in Tiananmen Square it took them ten hours to respond as they brought
[03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:53.640]  them in from 800 miles away a whole different ethnic group everybody knows
[03:13:53.640 --> 03:13:57.400]  you you don't use troops from the area because when their uncles out there with
[03:13:57.400 --> 03:14:00.720]  a gun and a picket line they're gonna say forget this and join their uncle and
[03:14:00.720 --> 03:14:04.960]  how did we stop and how did we get somebody to do something at Tiananmen
[03:14:04.960 --> 03:14:11.280]  Square a citizen stands in the way of a tank that's one of the most remarkable
[03:14:11.280 --> 03:14:16.440]  photographs ever taken in the last 100 years a citizen standing in the way and
[03:14:16.440 --> 03:14:20.360]  that is what we have to do with our sheriffs and local officials against
[03:14:20.360 --> 03:14:24.640]  the corruption of our own government we have to have sheriffs willing to
[03:14:24.640 --> 03:14:28.600]  interpose themselves I agree I was interviewing you ten years ago and I
[03:14:28.600 --> 03:14:31.720]  remember you saying they're gonna start using troops on the streets they're
[03:14:31.720 --> 03:14:34.680]  breaking it down and people would call you conspiracy terrorist now it's
[03:14:34.680 --> 03:14:38.440]  admitted and this guy calls in and goes yeah I'm an officer and I think it's a
[03:14:38.440 --> 03:14:42.880]  great idea but don't but don't but don't take it to the level where you think
[03:14:42.880 --> 03:14:48.000]  everything's bad yeah I'm afraid of everything kind of like George Washington
[03:14:48.000 --> 03:14:52.400]  and Thomas Jefferson said government is dangerous like fire it's a dangerous
[03:14:52.400 --> 03:14:57.000]  servant a fearful master right I mean you know we're yeah and we're all the
[03:14:57.000 --> 03:15:02.040]  only thing I'm after is I want to be left alone Randy Weaver the only thing
[03:15:02.040 --> 03:15:05.400]  he wanted was to be left all over the country you can't even grow gardens at
[03:15:05.400 --> 03:15:09.200]  your house when there's not even a law yeah and it's just getting so ridiculous
[03:15:09.200 --> 03:15:15.360]  and and now the state legislature of Texas was standing against the TSA and
[03:15:15.360 --> 03:15:18.320]  they were threatened by the federal government and they backed off you know
[03:15:18.320 --> 03:15:22.600]  why this guy's listening he's looking for fault because he doesn't sound like a
[03:15:22.600 --> 03:15:26.840]  bad guy he's made excuses yeah and he's trying to rationalize what he's doing
[03:15:26.840 --> 03:15:30.480]  well and to make and to rationalize what government is doing all over the place
[03:15:30.480 --> 03:15:35.480]  and and I and I don't see anything watching what's going on in Washington DC
[03:15:35.480 --> 03:15:40.200]  right now how could anybody say something good is happening when this
[03:15:40.200 --> 03:15:44.480]  country wasn't perfect was better than any other the government gave people land
[03:15:44.480 --> 03:15:48.400]  because they wanted folks to have children and prosper yeah okay now and I
[03:15:48.400 --> 03:15:52.320]  just got chills again because this I did used to get these chills I'm so upset at
[03:15:52.320 --> 03:15:58.000]  a fundamental level at such common sense almost everybody I know in in family I
[03:15:58.000 --> 03:16:01.800]  have in West Texas and East Texas and other areas can't pay and over the
[03:16:01.800 --> 03:16:05.080]  decades they've sold off more and more family land who are now they're down to
[03:16:05.080 --> 03:16:08.960]  20 30 40 acres and it's it's where the homestead is they love it they work in
[03:16:08.960 --> 03:16:12.480]  town during the day they work on the cows and the fence on the weekend and the
[03:16:12.480 --> 03:16:15.160]  government's getting rid of the tax exemptions and raising sales taxes
[03:16:15.160 --> 03:16:18.240]  everybody's losing their land and you're telling me there's nothing wrong with
[03:16:18.240 --> 03:16:23.680]  America we're losing our very way of life we've lost our soul we've lost the
[03:16:23.680 --> 03:16:30.000]  American soul Pat Buchanan when he went for president back in 1996 was saying
[03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:34.080]  these very same things he was talking about the New World Order he was talking
[03:16:34.080 --> 03:16:38.560]  about protecting our borders that's the biggest told us nafta and get what the
[03:16:38.560 --> 03:16:43.000]  industrializes they called him a fearful person right he was absolutely right and
[03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:47.640]  so was Pat Buchanan especially about protecting our borders he saw it then
[03:16:47.640 --> 03:16:53.200]  and people called him crazy and an isolationist an isolationist and it
[03:16:53.200 --> 03:16:58.440]  turned out now it's all bitten us back on the butt and wow now nobody's
[03:16:58.440 --> 03:17:02.720]  more globalism Sheriff Mac tell us about speaking to Sheriff Mac dot com on the

[03:17:26.640 --> 03:17:31.320]  traveling all over the other the best book in the country for exact for finding
[03:17:31.320 --> 03:17:35.680]  the solution to what's going on our country is the county sheriff America's
[03:17:35.680 --> 03:17:39.480]  last hope get that on my website get it to every sheriff they need to be knee
[03:17:39.480 --> 03:17:43.040]  deep in them but every citizen needs to read it to you've got to know what to
[03:17:43.040 --> 03:17:47.640]  tell your sheriff is his duty to protect you and by a bunch and give them to
[03:17:47.640 --> 03:17:51.320]  local sheriff's deputy absolutely let's go to Jeff and George make somebody
[03:17:51.320 --> 03:17:55.200]  gives one to Josh all right thank you I'm gonna skip this break a little bit
[03:17:55.200 --> 03:17:57.960]  longer I'm never gonna get my work done on the TV show seven o'clock tonight
[03:17:57.960 --> 03:18:02.760]  prison planet TV Jeff and Georgia what you think of the last guy I think he's
[03:18:02.760 --> 03:18:06.640]  trying to rationalize why he goes to work every day because I am an active
[03:18:06.640 --> 03:18:11.800]  duty officer I think you read the oath a little different but I don't take no
[03:18:11.800 --> 03:18:15.560]  to the governor or the state or anything that's what I don't know it the
[03:18:15.560 --> 03:18:19.360]  difference between the off-road than illicit oath he is correct is the
[03:18:19.360 --> 03:18:23.000]  enlisted guy does take him oh to the president of the United States the
[03:18:23.000 --> 03:18:27.400]  officer specifically and only to the Constitution and that's why it's
[03:18:27.400 --> 03:18:30.480]  important for officers to know the Constitution so they know what orders
[03:18:30.480 --> 03:18:35.440]  yeah I was reading the general I was reading the general enlisted yes right
[03:18:35.440 --> 03:18:40.200]  so that's why the four officers had to be always commissioned by Congress so
[03:18:40.200 --> 03:18:44.120]  people knew hey you work for the people not not ill-president day right yeah
[03:18:44.120 --> 03:18:47.760]  I appreciate everything you're doing long-time call or a long-time listener
[03:18:47.760 --> 03:18:51.720]  prison planet member and first-time caller what did you think of that guy I
[03:18:51.720 --> 03:18:56.080]  think like I said I they laugh at me at work every day when I try to tell them
[03:18:56.080 --> 03:18:59.360]  I you know like all that we had we actually had a point where we were having
[03:18:59.360 --> 03:19:04.280]  a big officer meeting and the guy were on a part-time works with the police
[03:19:04.280 --> 03:19:06.800]  department he said hey they're gonna be doing random seatbelt checks and
[03:19:06.800 --> 03:19:10.360]  registration checks everything I said hey we just had a guy get promoted say the
[03:19:10.360 --> 03:19:14.680]  oath of office which violates the Fourth Amendment and they all laughed at me you
[03:19:14.680 --> 03:19:18.360]  know I mean they I mean they just laugh and laugh and laugh and they just nobody
[03:19:18.360 --> 03:19:22.960]  is awake so you're a police officer you're active duty naval officer okay so
[03:19:22.960 --> 03:19:27.120]  but I mean the issue here is for anybody that laughs at the Constitution well
[03:19:27.120 --> 03:19:33.120]  okay all we can run a checkpoint without a warrant but then next oh we can take
[03:19:33.120 --> 03:19:36.480]  your bank account for no reason right or the police chief can fire the mayor
[03:19:36.480 --> 03:19:40.160]  because we say so folks if you don't have the Constitution Bill of Rights you
[03:19:40.160 --> 03:19:43.520]  are now in Hearts of Darkness you want to explain that to him
[03:19:43.520 --> 03:19:47.920]  well that's that's I think it's so typical though look at what's going on
[03:19:47.920 --> 03:19:52.000]  around you you'll see it yourself the callers everybody that we have now we
[03:19:52.000 --> 03:19:56.000]  have a naval officer calling that is seeing the world completely opposite of
[03:19:56.000 --> 03:20:01.400]  Josh and all we're talking about here is look what's going on don't believe me
[03:20:01.400 --> 03:20:05.320]  don't believe you check it out for yourself just like the caller said check
[03:20:05.320 --> 03:20:08.600]  it out you heard that guy's denial he thought I would put out a fake video of
[03:20:08.600 --> 03:20:13.040]  troops running across the city and screaming at of course those are troops
[03:20:13.040 --> 03:20:19.520]  I mean listen how many people that you talk to at work in the Navy are even
[03:20:19.520 --> 03:20:25.480]  halfway awake less than a third I mean cuz they're so they keep they just want
[03:20:25.480 --> 03:20:29.360]  to keep your head down they keep you so occupied they keep you so busy they
[03:20:29.360 --> 03:20:33.680]  don't want you lifting your head up and looking above the bushes you know they
[03:20:33.680 --> 03:20:40.080]  just keep you tap-tap-tap yeah well that's sad that's really sad you know
[03:20:40.080 --> 03:20:45.600]  and I you know I respect Josh for calling in and I respect somebody who who or I
[03:20:45.600 --> 03:20:49.360]  understand how somebody wants to rationalize everything and make their
[03:20:49.360 --> 03:20:54.000]  job look decent and what what law enforcement officers who say well you
[03:20:54.000 --> 03:20:57.960]  know we just have to enforce the laws you know and I've got to keep my job you
[03:20:57.960 --> 03:21:01.200]  know I'm not I don't agree with that anymore if you're gonna prostitute
[03:21:01.200 --> 03:21:05.360]  yourself to keep your job then we don't need it started in Germany at first
[03:21:05.360 --> 03:21:09.560]  with Hitler little things yeah I like the Weimar Republic Constitution and
[03:21:09.560 --> 03:21:13.120]  pretty soon after you violated a bunch of little things that I mean there's
[03:21:13.120 --> 03:21:18.760]  nothing holding us there but there's nothing under us anymore the Constitution
[03:21:18.760 --> 03:21:23.240]  is a shield against tyranny folks it's our it's it's like the magnetic field of
[03:21:23.240 --> 03:21:26.280]  the earth if we didn't have that magnetic field the earth would set on fire
[03:21:26.280 --> 03:21:31.160]  within hours that's it's like the magnetic shield of the earth you were
[03:21:31.160 --> 03:21:34.240]  trying to say something Jeff go ahead I mean to be honest with you during the
[03:21:34.240 --> 03:21:38.960]  first Gulf War I was I was totally asleep ready to go doing all the stuff
[03:21:38.960 --> 03:21:42.920]  they wanted you to do but you each individual citizen needs to find out
[03:21:42.920 --> 03:21:47.920]  what wakes them up what woke me up was the public school system and money and
[03:21:47.920 --> 03:21:51.160]  reading President Andrew Jackson's farewell address about the banking
[03:21:51.160 --> 03:21:54.400]  elite learning about Keynesian economics how they're stealing your money
[03:21:54.400 --> 03:21:57.960]  throughout because you know I mean I was a muscle car guy I wanted always wanted
[03:21:57.960 --> 03:22:01.840]  a car and I could it was always out of reach when I could afford 3000 it was
[03:22:01.840 --> 03:22:06.240]  six when I could afford six they were 12 and they were I could afford 12 they were
[03:22:06.240 --> 03:22:10.560]  20 you know so you got to find out what wakes you up but I mean I sat down and
[03:22:10.560 --> 03:22:15.680]  cried three days for three days when I saw how that I sent my three daughters
[03:22:15.680 --> 03:22:20.640]  basically to an indoctrination corruption camp to be used against me you
[03:22:20.640 --> 03:22:23.760]  know and I thought I was doing doctor nation camp you're talking about you're
[03:22:23.760 --> 03:22:27.080]  talking about public schools right correct yeah that's what they are yeah
[03:22:27.080 --> 03:22:32.160]  folks we are under social engineering and it makes me sick to watch these
[03:22:32.160 --> 03:22:35.880]  globalists get away with it once you get out of their trance and they're con and
[03:22:35.880 --> 03:22:40.440]  know it's a con it's how con artists work then you realize how dumb I was ever
[03:22:40.440 --> 03:22:44.280]  buying this and then all you want to do is bring them to justice I mean I burn
[03:22:44.280 --> 03:22:48.600]  with the desire to stop these people I will know we can beat them if we just
[03:22:48.600 --> 03:22:53.920]  believe we can and break the trance you grave to Sheriff Mack yeah I mean it is
[03:22:53.920 --> 03:22:58.160]  and we aren't a trance and the brainwashing has continues and the
[03:22:58.160 --> 03:23:03.760]  the worst accomplice with the government brainwashing is the mainstream media I
[03:23:03.760 --> 03:23:08.400]  mean they are all over it you know they're bought and paid for totally
[03:23:08.400 --> 03:23:12.680]  bought and paid for and it's almost like it a separate branch of or just another
[03:23:12.680 --> 03:23:17.280]  leg of the MSNBC got hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer money in
[03:23:17.280 --> 03:23:20.840]  the bailout secretly no wonder when they would ask Bernanke where the money go
[03:23:20.840 --> 03:23:23.960]  he'd say I'm not going to tell you right I mean Rachel Maddow and these people are
[03:23:23.960 --> 03:23:27.720]  actually taxpayer paid to sit there and say if you don't want government
[03:23:27.720 --> 03:23:32.000]  health care you're a racist I mean they are the people trying to create racism
[03:23:32.000 --> 03:23:35.840]  God bless you Jeff I'm glad you could talk to Josh there well yeah we do need
[03:23:35.840 --> 03:23:42.400]  to use the military on the streets I mean why do you move to Guatemala then
[03:23:42.400 --> 03:23:46.200]  buddy if you want move to China you can see plenty of it yeah Bill in Florida
[03:23:46.200 --> 03:23:48.280]  you're on the air we got to move quick now thanks for holding you're on the
[03:23:48.280 --> 03:23:53.480]  air with Sheriff Richard Mack hey Mr. Jones hey buddy hey I'm the one that
[03:23:53.480 --> 03:23:56.920]  sent the article from homesteaded reserve base about the police officers
[03:23:56.920 --> 03:24:02.120]  going over and detaining that suspect but it just doesn't stop there on this
[03:24:02.120 --> 03:24:06.560]  little base that thinks it can it's a it's a lot of brainwashing I see them
[03:24:06.560 --> 03:24:14.440]  all the time pulling people over on the public roads and waiting for the deputy
[03:24:14.440 --> 03:24:20.120]  sheriff's come in to give him take it they pull them over and then title tell
[03:24:20.120 --> 03:24:25.360]  on them to the deputy oh yeah they have they have all over the country DUI
[03:24:25.360 --> 03:24:30.640]  checkpoints sometimes 50 miles from a base with our Marines oh that's great
[03:24:30.640 --> 03:24:35.640]  well I'm gonna tell you right now any sheriff in this country should put a
[03:24:35.640 --> 03:24:39.600]  stop to all of those well I mean the old even 20 years ago whether they're done
[03:24:39.600 --> 03:24:43.720]  by the military or the state I was wrong exactly you know but I mean exact
[03:24:43.720 --> 03:24:47.640]  now it's not just checkpoints it's troops look I have the newscast I'm gonna
[03:24:47.640 --> 03:24:51.360]  get it added Fox News in New York where they go we've made 2000 arrested army
[03:24:51.360 --> 03:24:54.920]  checkpoints in the middle of this and they're driving families under high
[03:24:54.920 --> 03:24:59.400]  powered x-ray scanners right and and historically speaking who was the best
[03:24:59.400 --> 03:25:04.320]  one at stopping everybody and checking for papers I mean we actually do that
[03:25:04.320 --> 03:25:09.000]  now in America and make excuses and the rationalization of our Josh caller to
[03:25:09.000 --> 03:25:13.200]  say that that's okay in America and that's what Josh I'm gonna tell you right
[03:25:13.200 --> 03:25:19.200]  now that's what scares me about America that you an officer in the military can
[03:25:19.200 --> 03:25:23.040]  say something like that and tell us there's something wrong with us for
[03:25:23.040 --> 03:25:27.680]  being afraid of those types of things going on when that is an exact hand me
[03:25:27.680 --> 03:25:31.520]  down from Nazi that that guy needs to read the founding fathers because we
[03:25:31.520 --> 03:25:36.080]  think we're radical I mean the founding fathers said arm up and attack
[03:25:36.080 --> 03:25:38.960]  anybody acts like this they said you better protect liberty and even if
[03:25:38.960 --> 03:25:42.000]  you're fully awake you're probably not gonna be able to keep it they were like
[03:25:42.000 --> 03:25:46.760]  you better be on your toes ready to it ready to face down corruption and even
[03:25:46.760 --> 03:25:50.360]  if you are you're probably not gonna keep it yeah they had to fight for seven
[03:25:50.360 --> 03:25:54.040]  years total hell to get that I mean what what do you people think all this
[03:25:54.040 --> 03:25:58.800]  stuff came for free the US is only land why has it been so wealthy because it
[03:25:58.800 --> 03:26:02.760]  had a little bit of freedom you morons and when we lose that we lose it all
[03:26:02.760 --> 03:26:07.840]  you jackasses and our kids will be slaves I'm sorry but that Josh guy makes
[03:26:07.840 --> 03:26:12.080]  you want to throw up his condescending attitude and all of it you're right
[03:26:12.080 --> 03:26:15.880]  finishing up bill are you in the military you just read about this I'm
[03:26:15.880 --> 03:26:19.080]  retired I'm the one that sent the article in and it was on our base website
[03:26:19.080 --> 03:26:24.720]  but see our wing commander gave us a a commander's call and he told us he was
[03:26:24.720 --> 03:26:28.960]  going to have the security forces make their presence known out here to the
[03:26:28.960 --> 03:26:34.520]  public for public viewing and because we had a murder there at that circle K
[03:26:34.520 --> 03:26:38.120]  about it's all just and it's always an excuse it's all that formation yeah
[03:26:38.120 --> 03:26:42.040]  there there was a murder so we got to do this there was 9-11 so we got to
[03:26:42.040 --> 03:26:46.880]  destroy your Constitution there's this there's guns in Mexico's we got to take
[03:26:46.880 --> 03:26:50.040]  your guns by the way the government gave it to him that's right isn't that
[03:26:50.040 --> 03:26:55.520]  wonderful yeah and it's illegal and it's breaking international law and it's
[03:26:55.520 --> 03:26:59.880]  all the biggest part of corruption that there was but this is still just ask
[03:26:59.880 --> 03:27:04.960]  Josh this is still a great place so bill what everything's fine anything else yeah
[03:27:04.960 --> 03:27:09.120]  I lost my driving privileges on base for 60 days because they wanted to search my
[03:27:09.120 --> 03:27:12.520]  truck and I gave them permission to search my vehicle because you're you're
[03:27:12.520 --> 03:27:16.480]  supposed to allow them when you come on a military relation well they told me to
[03:27:16.480 --> 03:27:21.480]  open up the doors and the hood of my truck and I told them up no you can
[03:27:21.480 --> 03:27:24.600]  search it but I'm not gonna do it and they said well you have to do it and I
[03:27:24.600 --> 03:27:28.000]  think well show me a regulation where it says I have to open up my vehicle I
[03:27:28.000 --> 03:27:31.960]  think if I was a criminal in handcuffs you guys would search my vehicle yeah
[03:27:31.960 --> 03:27:35.840]  if you're such a danger in procedure anyways you they're supposed to stand
[03:27:35.840 --> 03:27:40.280]  back they're supposed to anyways I mean this is ridiculous so it would be in
[03:27:40.280 --> 03:27:44.960]  dentured servitude so what happened well I refuse I said you have permission to
[03:27:44.960 --> 03:27:50.200]  search my vehicle well the the security forces supervisor came out and the
[03:27:50.200 --> 03:27:53.840]  security forces there was five guys and they just they just stared at me they
[03:27:53.840 --> 03:27:57.000]  couldn't believe I said no I said I didn't say no you couldn't search my
[03:27:57.000 --> 03:28:01.160]  vehicle I said I'm not opening the doors for it and they said well you need to
[03:28:01.160 --> 03:28:04.760]  because we feel uncomfortable and I said what are you afraid to break a finger
[03:28:04.760 --> 03:28:09.560]  no they're already getting ready to brand it over to the military God bless
[03:28:09.560 --> 03:28:13.200]  you and I appreciate your call I wish I could get to Ron and Jared I bet they've
[03:28:13.200 --> 03:28:16.600]  got even more but I've got to hit this final news item Ron and Jared call me
[03:28:16.600 --> 03:28:19.280]  back tomorrow we'll do more of this with military and police calling it it's
[03:28:19.280 --> 03:28:23.160]  always great and actually I'm always I mean they actually talk a lot more
[03:28:23.160 --> 03:28:26.280]  focused than you know just even just a random average caller I guess as they've
[03:28:26.280 --> 03:28:29.400]  lived in the real world it's good to hear from them but we're here about this
[03:28:29.400 --> 03:28:34.880]  AWOL soldier arrested over concerns of possible second attack on Fort Hood but
[03:28:34.880 --> 03:28:38.360]  then meanwhile at the Fort Hood shooting it turns out the government was
[03:28:38.360 --> 03:28:42.280]  protecting this guy for two years and Amaral Alaki that secretly hangs out at
[03:28:42.280 --> 03:28:46.200]  the Pentagon was running him so but but but here's the report today Obama to
[03:28:46.200 --> 03:28:51.200]  approve Al Qaeda embassy that's in quotes French news agency reporting in
[03:28:51.200 --> 03:28:55.120]  Washington and admitting that it is real Al Qaeda is the group that we're
[03:28:55.120 --> 03:29:00.840]  funding against Gaddafi what's your take on that Sheriff Mack well that goes
[03:29:00.840 --> 03:29:07.240]  back to truth is stranger than fiction I still I'm I'm I still think of Josh
[03:29:07.240 --> 03:29:11.240]  every time you read that you're just reading the news and what's he gonna do
[03:29:11.240 --> 03:29:16.680]  spend that to say well now it's everything's fine no I'm sorry everything's
[03:29:16.680 --> 03:29:23.040]  not fine and we need to change what's going on absolutely it's a professor
[03:29:23.040 --> 03:29:27.080]  Griff a quote no in the Obama deception he goes listen I'm saying something
[03:29:27.080 --> 03:29:30.120]  all the black people out there he goes you think just we got a black president
[03:29:30.120 --> 03:29:32.600]  everything's gonna be all right everything's gonna be just fine no
[03:29:32.600 --> 03:29:36.240]  everything isn't just gonna be all right it's not all right and look you have to
[03:29:36.240 --> 03:29:40.440]  be involved you have to be jealous of liberty as Thomas Jefferson said you
[03:29:40.440 --> 03:29:44.440]  have to defend that jewel because that's the jewel the criminals are after
[03:29:44.440 --> 03:29:48.240]  criminals get control of government they're God we'll be back tonight 7 o'clock
