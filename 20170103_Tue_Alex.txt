[00:00.000 --> 00:24.000]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[00:24.000 --> 00:26.000]  Move it!
[00:26.000 --> 00:28.000]  Get out of the way!
[00:28.000 --> 00:34.000]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[00:34.000 --> 00:38.000]  Info wars helped to rule the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[00:38.000 --> 00:42.000]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[00:42.000 --> 00:48.000]  I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[00:48.000 --> 00:50.000]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:50.000 --> 00:56.000]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th president of the United States.
[00:56.000 --> 01:03.000]  Waging war on corruption is Alex Jones.
[01:03.000 --> 01:08.000]  So let's just say you and your girlfriend were pregnant, and you're happily expecting a baby,
[01:08.000 --> 01:13.000]  and someone came along and punched her in the stomach a few times and killed the baby.
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.000]  Would that be a murder then, or is that just...
[01:17.000 --> 01:24.000]  Yeah, that would be a murder if someone came in and punched your wife, your pregnant wife, in the stomach.
[01:24.000 --> 01:26.000]  Did someone punch them?
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.000]  Hold on, hold on. So it's okay, hold on.
[01:30.000 --> 01:40.000]  So your girlfriend can kill her baby, and that's not murder, but then if someone else punches her in the stomach, then it is murder.
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.000]  Yes, sir.
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.000]  Can you explain that to us?
[01:44.000 --> 01:50.000]  I mean, actually you should be able to have abortion if you want to.
[01:50.000 --> 01:54.000]  I mean, eight months is a little bit far. I think there should be a cutoff.
[01:54.000 --> 01:55.000]  Two months.
[01:55.000 --> 01:56.000]  What? Say...
[01:56.000 --> 01:57.000]  Two months.
[01:57.000 --> 02:03.000]  Two months? Actually, is two months the first trimester, or what's the months related to trimesters?
[02:03.000 --> 02:08.000]  The first month is two trimester, or first trimester is two months? Is that correct?
[02:08.000 --> 02:10.000]  The three months is the first trimester.
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  Okay, so three months.
[02:12.000 --> 02:14.000]  Let's say it's two months in.
[02:14.000 --> 02:20.000]  But that's just in the middle of nowhere. Is it the first trimester, or is it the second trimester, or is it the third trimester?
[02:20.000 --> 02:23.000]  We need a person with a uterus to answer this question.
[02:23.000 --> 02:25.000]  I'm not from here, sir.
[02:25.000 --> 02:26.000]  Oh, you're not?
[02:26.000 --> 02:27.000]  No, I'm sorry.
[02:27.000 --> 02:40.000]  If a woman was a couple months pregnant, very excited about having her baby, and someone were to punch her in the stomach a few times and cause a miscarriage.
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.000]  What do you think that person should be charged with?
[02:43.000 --> 02:50.000]  Oh, that's a good question.
[02:50.000 --> 02:54.000]  Is that a murder, then?
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.000]  Possibly. Possibly. You said what? A couple months?
[02:57.000 --> 02:59.000]  A couple months.
[02:59.000 --> 03:05.000]  That's really... I like how you put that one question after the other about abortion.
[03:05.000 --> 03:12.000]  Is having abortion in the first trimester, is that a murder, or is that just an abortion?
[03:12.000 --> 03:19.000]  I feel like it's just an abortion. Once the birth goes on, until a certain point, you can't have an abortion.
[03:19.000 --> 03:22.000]  So in the first two months or so, you think that's okay?
[03:22.000 --> 03:30.000]  Yeah, because not all people are allowed to, but not allowed, but not all people can, what am I trying to say here, can't support a child on their own.
[03:30.000 --> 03:36.000]  So if you made a mistake of getting pregnant, why not fix it?
[03:36.000 --> 03:48.000]  So if your girlfriend or wife was two months pregnant, and somebody decided to punch her in the stomach a few times and cause a miscarriage,
[03:48.000 --> 03:51.000]  what should that person be charged with, murdering your baby?
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.000]  That person, yes, because that's not a self-conscious abortion.
[03:55.000 --> 04:02.000]  So she can murder her baby, and it's not murder, but if somebody else wants to kill the baby, then that is murder.
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.000]  As long as it doesn't have a heartbeat yet, it's not murder.
[04:07.000 --> 04:12.000]  Okay, so you just said that the person should be charged with murder, so now they shouldn't be charged with murder?
[04:12.000 --> 04:18.000]  Let's say one of your bros is like, man, this guy can't be having a kid, we still need to party.
[04:18.000 --> 04:22.000]  And he punches her in the stomach a few times to kill the baby. Is that murder or an hour now?
[04:22.000 --> 04:23.000]  That is murder.
[04:23.000 --> 04:24.000]  It is murder.
[04:24.000 --> 04:25.000]  Yes, but it's not murder.
[04:25.000 --> 04:27.000]  That's a battery aggravated assault.
[04:27.000 --> 04:28.000]  Murder?
[04:28.000 --> 04:29.000]  That's just wrecking the charges right there.
[04:29.000 --> 04:34.000]  So how is it murder though, if she can kill the baby, you said that that's okay.
[04:34.000 --> 04:35.000]  But like, or let's say a few.
[04:35.000 --> 04:40.000]  Because within the first few weeks, if she has sex one night and gets impregnated.
[04:40.000 --> 04:41.000]  This is a tough one, I know.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000]  If she gets impregnated on night A, right?
[04:43.000 --> 04:46.000]  No, we're talking about, we're already talking about, we're already talking about two months in.
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  Morning B, she takes the plan B field.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  Now there's totally a different subject.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  And that actually stops things.
[04:52.000 --> 04:53.000]  No heartbeat whatsoever.
[04:53.000 --> 04:54.000]  Oh my gosh.
[04:54.000 --> 04:55.000]  And it's not murder.
[04:55.000 --> 05:00.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, December, I don't know, January.
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.000]  On New Year's Day in Kiev, there was a torchlight procession.
[05:04.000 --> 05:10.000]  The Ukrainian neo-Nazis were marching through the center of the capitol, celebrating the birthday of Stepan Bandera,
[05:10.000 --> 05:15.000]  the leader of the Ukrainian insurgent army, who was also Nazi sympathizer and a collaborator during World War II.
[05:15.000 --> 05:19.000]  All the more reasons to be hailed as hero by the Maidan government.
[05:19.000 --> 05:23.000]  The followers of Bandera proudly promoting Nazi slogans and the symbolics of the Third Reich.
[05:23.000 --> 05:27.000]  Hence their love for torchlight processions, which were especially popular in Hitler's Germany.
[05:27.000 --> 05:30.000]  The present-day admirers of Bandera are deeply misled.
[05:30.000 --> 05:36.000]  They glorify the myths given to them, conveniently ignoring the facts of history and repeat it in present-day Ukraine.
[05:36.000 --> 05:39.000]  They murder their own countrymen under the guise of liberation of the people.
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  They murder their own ideological supporters who happen to choose a different leader.
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  And they call it fighting for their country's independence.
[05:45.000 --> 05:49.000]  They murder and betray each other under the guise of unity and brotherhood.
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.000]  Well, let's call it for what it is.
[05:51.000 --> 05:52.000]  Betrayal.
[05:52.000 --> 05:58.000]  The trailer of your people and your country and the enemy within is more dangerous than any outside threat.
[05:58.000 --> 06:26.000]  This has been Daria for Infowars.com.

[08:27.000 --> 08:36.000]  Worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy tankooper.
[08:36.000 --> 09:00.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[09:00.000 --> 09:10.000]  Thanks for watching.
[09:30.000 --> 09:52.000]  The date is Tuesday, January 3, 2017.
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.000]  We are now only 16 days until Donald Trump.
[09:57.000 --> 10:08.000]  President-elect becomes the official 45th president of the greatest republic that's ever been seen on the face of this magical earth.
[10:08.000 --> 10:13.000]  It is historic. The forces of tyranny, the forces trying to stop innovation,
[10:13.000 --> 10:20.000]  the forces trying to bring in a new dark age of oppression and control are scrambling across the world
[10:20.000 --> 10:31.000]  as their stranglehold on humanity becomes looser and looser and panic fills their vampiric eyes.
[10:31.000 --> 10:37.000]  Sometimes when history is staring you right in the face and you're so close to something so big,
[10:37.000 --> 10:46.000]  you don't tend to realize just how important a player you are all in, this huge fight for liberty.
[10:46.000 --> 10:50.000]  None of us do.
[10:50.000 --> 10:56.000]  At least those of us that aren't arrogant narcissists who only want to run around and basically,
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.000]  they have like a bunch of peacocks.
[10:59.000 --> 11:04.000]  Now, I have a mission-driven life and I want to defend liberty, but I'll be quite honest with you.
[11:04.000 --> 11:18.000]  I've been so close to this problem and this information for so long that it only dawned on me this morning.
[11:18.000 --> 11:27.000]  And then the magnitude of it was so big that I don't even feel worthy of giving you this information.
[11:27.000 --> 11:35.000]  That's why it tends when something so huge, so massive, so breaking, I tend to almost hold back sometime because I just can't even imagine
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.000]  how I'm supposed to announce and roll this information out.
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.000]  In fact, I had guests coming in here at 11.30.
[11:41.000 --> 11:48.000]  I want to move those guests to noon or whenever you're listening in a rebroadcast to the next hour
[11:48.000 --> 11:54.000]  because I need to just really focus and think about what I'm going to say here.
[11:54.000 --> 12:01.000]  I'm not somebody that goes off notes and this is so big and I tend to just go over all my documentation
[12:01.000 --> 12:04.000]  instead of just getting into the big statement itself.
[12:04.000 --> 12:07.000]  We kind of get lost in all the proof, don't we?
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.000]  The proof's all right here on air, everything you've seen.
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  The allegory I would use would be like Ender's Game.
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000]  Never read it when it was a book.
[12:15.000 --> 12:17.000]  My sister was into the books.
[12:17.000 --> 12:22.000]  Then I went and saw the movie and it was okay, but the whole preface is what I find to be interesting.
[12:22.000 --> 12:31.000]  This is an archetype that this war gamer kid doesn't know at the end that he's actually battling the enemy
[12:31.000 --> 12:37.000]  because they wanted him to just completely get into the zone of fictional war play until he was actually in it
[12:37.000 --> 12:42.000]  and didn't know that the whole time he's going out to the edge of the galaxy and fighting
[12:42.000 --> 12:46.000]  and then, of course, genocide in the enemy.
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.000]  And quite frankly, I got involved on air because I really wanted to warn people.
[12:50.000 --> 12:55.000]  They were coming for our guns. They were stealing farmer and ranchers property under environmental guises.
[12:55.000 --> 12:58.000]  There was just a lot of corrupt stuff I saw personally.
[12:58.000 --> 13:06.000]  When I went to college, all they did in every class I had at community college was Bad Mouth America, Bad Mouth White People.
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.000]  These were white professors, all of them.
[13:08.000 --> 13:18.000]  And just talk about the overthrow of our republic and how horrible free market capitalism was, except for one black lady
[13:18.000 --> 13:25.000]  who was teaching basically remedial algebra because I was good at everything else straight A's but math
[13:25.000 --> 13:30.000]  and I was having to like get ready to try to get my scores up so I could actually, you know, then place and get into UT
[13:30.000 --> 13:33.000]  which, which later I started the process of it did, but that never went.
[13:33.000 --> 13:38.000]  The point was, this black lady, it was a true activist. I forget her name. I'm going to go dig it up.
[13:38.000 --> 13:44.000]  She was a really nice lady and she'd been to Africa several times on aid missions and she said all this left his stuff a bunch of bull.
[13:44.000 --> 13:47.000]  It's much more sophisticated than that is to control everybody.
[13:47.000 --> 13:56.000]  We're all hearing in these classes all this stuff about, you know, how bad white people are and, you know, how we're doing all these bad things.
[13:56.000 --> 14:00.000]  But she goes, you need to go to Africa before you really see what's going on.
[14:00.000 --> 14:06.000]  And she was just talking about how it was all culture warfare and how the leftist were basically just another arm of the same system.
[14:06.000 --> 14:15.000]  And even at 18 years old, 19 years old, I wasn't fully getting what she was saying when she was just so disgusted with the entire place
[14:15.000 --> 14:25.000]  because it was a brainwashing laboratory, a brainwashing laboratory.
[14:25.000 --> 14:29.000]  At the bottom of the hour, I'm going to break the big news.
[14:29.000 --> 14:37.000]  I'm going to tell you the history of what's happened with the hacks of the DNC.
[14:37.000 --> 14:41.000]  I'm going to tell you what's happened with the hacks with Hillary's server.
[14:41.000 --> 14:47.000]  I'm going to break it all down and then I'm going to go over the facts of it.
[14:47.000 --> 15:00.000]  But starting about a year ago, I had folks that are currently informally high level, different intelligence agencies on record and off record correct me.
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.000]  So much of what you're going to hear at the bottom of the hour, you've already heard here on the show in pieces.
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.000]  But we really should put it up there in lights for everybody.
[15:06.000 --> 15:10.000]  Hell, this message should be up on the side of the Goodyear blimp.
[15:10.000 --> 15:17.000]  And then what Obama is currently doing in the last 16 days, what they're going to attempt to do once Trump gets in.
[15:17.000 --> 15:26.000]  Info wars really is the place where the highest level factual real information is released.
[15:26.000 --> 15:34.000]  There's a lot of other good information at Drudge and Zero Hedge and Breitbart, but we really are it.
[15:34.000 --> 15:35.000]  We're the best there is.
[15:35.000 --> 15:40.000]  And I don't say that out of some position of a power trip, it's the opposite.
[15:40.000 --> 15:45.000]  It makes me get short of breath because I'm smiling to speak to a crowd of 10,000 people and not get any butterflies.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  I'm somebody that has a lot of confidence.
[15:47.000 --> 15:53.000]  But when it comes to doing the right thing and like doing, I guess brain surgery on a little kid.
[15:53.000 --> 15:59.000]  They say brain surgeons have one of the lowest life expectancy is incredible heart attacks, incredible stress because it's so microscopic.
[15:59.000 --> 16:08.000]  What they're doing when these huge scopes are looking through these microscopes basically that any wrong move, they're going to brain damage or, you know, kill their patient.
[16:08.000 --> 16:13.000]  And it's that same feeling of, wow, this is really dangerous.
[16:13.000 --> 16:14.000]  This is real.
[16:14.000 --> 16:15.000]  This isn't movies.
[16:15.000 --> 16:16.000]  This isn't spy thrillers.
[16:16.000 --> 16:19.000]  This isn't, you know, the days of the condor or whatever.
[16:19.000 --> 16:28.000]  This is the real deal for Western civilization and the whole future basically of humanity and all of us that are the info wars family.
[16:28.000 --> 16:32.000]  Are just the focal point of the resistance.
[16:32.000 --> 16:36.000]  I'm part of the focal point like a composite eye on a dragonfly.
[16:36.000 --> 16:37.000]  You're a part of the composite eye.
[16:37.000 --> 16:42.000]  All of us together with the activism and the focus and Americana.
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  We are the remnant.
[16:44.000 --> 16:51.000]  We're what's left of what they tried to exterminate culturally, spiritually, genetically, everything.
[16:51.000 --> 16:59.000]  And it's going to be our job to return the Republic or at least desperately in the next 30 years battling AI and the globalist.
[16:59.000 --> 17:11.000]  It will be our job to make sure that this remnant makes it through that level to the next remnant because all that has to make it is a remnant of humans that are truly intact, not completely genetically mutated and poisoned and dead.
[17:11.000 --> 17:22.000]  If we get a thousand of us through this thing, we're going to win as long as the species makes it out of its greatest challenge it's now facing.
[17:22.000 --> 17:26.000]  That's part of a whole larger issue.
[17:26.000 --> 17:37.000]  But I do have the sense of the long game, the long war and I'm not a selfish person.
[17:37.000 --> 17:41.000]  Because I'm the most selfish person you'll ever meet.
[17:41.000 --> 17:42.000]  Let me explain that.
[17:42.000 --> 17:48.000]  I will lay down my life to see humanity make it not be scum and I believe in the species.
[17:48.000 --> 17:53.000]  And I see the globalist demonizing and putting us down 24 seven and I'm sick of it.
[17:53.000 --> 17:55.000]  And I know their spirit and who they are.
[17:55.000 --> 17:56.000]  They must be defeated.
[17:56.000 --> 18:05.000]  I'm selfish for my children and your children and their great grandchildren together into the future so we can continue the amazing experiment of men and women loving each other.
[18:05.000 --> 18:12.000]  And merging their genetics and creating new beautiful creatures with wonderful souls and all the discovery and all the amazing things and all the love and all the passion.
[18:12.000 --> 18:20.000]  I want to go on and on and on because I know there's eternal life in our species and in our genetics as long as we succeed as a species.
[18:20.000 --> 18:25.000]  I fear the death of the species so much.
[18:25.000 --> 18:27.000]  I have no fear for my life.
[18:27.000 --> 18:32.000]  In fact, I have to control myself and just because it's the opposite of fear.
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.000]  It's total will to defeat the enemy and it's so empowering.
[18:36.000 --> 18:41.000]  I can't even contain it and it's that spirit that we're releasing on the enemy.
[18:41.000 --> 18:46.000]  And I'll just tell you, I've sat there and talked to Trump before I said that to him.
[18:46.000 --> 18:48.000]  He said that to me.
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  It incredible.
[18:50.000 --> 18:55.000]  The real Donald Trump.
[18:55.000 --> 18:59.000]  And people are going to see that they're going to see the spirit.
[18:59.000 --> 19:03.000]  Of justice and a prosperity turned loose.
[19:03.000 --> 19:07.000]  And that's why the enemy is freaking out because the enemy knows.
[19:07.000 --> 19:11.000]  And I've got to hand it to Trump the way he cloaked this, this long.
[19:11.000 --> 19:18.000]  He's just a master to counter these dark sorcerers.
[19:18.000 --> 19:21.000]  And they're scared.
[19:21.000 --> 19:23.000]  They're scared.
[19:23.000 --> 19:24.000]  They're real scared.
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  And they should be.
[19:26.000 --> 19:32.000]  Because Trump and myself, people like Drudge, we're all just the first big wave.
[19:32.000 --> 19:38.000]  Stuff's coming after us real fast as the spirit rises that is going to absolutely devastate the enemy.
[19:38.000 --> 19:42.000]  But let me give you a warning, the enemy is going to turn loose some stuff as well.
[19:42.000 --> 19:45.000]  We're going to see their champions stomp out on the field.
[19:45.000 --> 19:46.000]  So get ready.
[19:46.000 --> 19:50.000]  I'm going to break down what's really behind WikiLeaks, the whole compendium, the battle inside the intelligence agencies.
[19:50.000 --> 19:55.000]  What's going to happen if Obama tries to block Trump and everything at the bottom of the hour
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.000]  with a T-minus 13 minutes.
[19:57.000 --> 20:00.000]  This is the most important broadcast I've ever done.
[20:00.000 --> 20:26.000]  Let's get started.
[20:26.000 --> 20:31.000]  Defendershield.com, the worldwide leader in EMF radiation protection.
[20:56.000 --> 21:01.000]  Ships free at fullycookedbacon.com.
[21:01.000 --> 21:07.000]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years,
[21:07.000 --> 21:12.000]  and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[21:12.000 --> 21:16.000]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.000]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[21:18.000 --> 21:24.000]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[21:24.000 --> 21:29.000]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins,
[21:29.000 --> 21:34.000]  minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients, so the body will heal itself.
[21:34.000 --> 21:40.000]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[21:40.000 --> 21:44.000]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetic cells.
[21:44.000 --> 21:49.000]  The body is an amazing thing. It simply needs some help, so it has the tools to heal itself.

[23:55.000 --> 24:00.000]  And with an ear-thinking and old trash can, press.
[24:25.000 --> 24:54.000]  16 days until Trump's seated as president, elected in a giant landslide,
[24:54.000 --> 25:00.000]  and finally won the popular vote, totally won the electoral, they stole five states we caught them in, probably more.
[25:00.000 --> 25:07.000]  Tried to steal five others, but those five states caught Homeland Security breaking in in the five states and blocked them.
[25:07.000 --> 25:14.000]  That's all come out. But not on the national news, because it's not news. It's enemy propaganda.
[25:14.000 --> 25:27.000]  Now, I got up this morning and saw that Julian Assange had come out and said, look, unequivocally, our source is not Russian.
[25:27.000 --> 25:36.000]  Now, I happen to know the multiple sources that Assange has.
[25:36.000 --> 25:45.000]  Let's say I know the sources. I know that multiple sources in U.S. intelligence, but also in NATO and also right out of the United Kingdom.
[25:45.000 --> 25:50.000]  I mean, he's got so many sources it'll make your head spin. He's got duplicates. He's got everything. It's so much stuff.
[25:50.000 --> 25:55.000]  A thousand people couldn't go over it all. That's why he has all these different journalists that are helping him.
[25:55.000 --> 26:00.000]  And let me just give you a newsflash. Some of them are operatives, the ones that turn on him, the ones that say, don't worry about his safety.
[26:00.000 --> 26:05.000]  He's fine. Greenwald and people are for real. You can tell they're for real, losing their jobs, having folks come after him.
[26:05.000 --> 26:15.000]  But when you sit there and you see the overall picture, clearly Assange is totally surrounded. The guy has amazing courage.
[26:15.000 --> 26:20.000]  But I've been told for over a year by multiple high-level sources exactly what's going on.
[26:20.000 --> 26:26.000]  And then so many times it comes true just like they said, and then I have my other sources and our own back channels.
[26:26.000 --> 26:31.000]  I mean, we broke what really happened in Magasi. We don't, but we're always so busy covering the next big issue.
[26:31.000 --> 26:37.000]  We don't give ourselves credit, which we should give ourselves credit so people understand that Cy Hirsch came on the show
[26:37.000 --> 26:43.000]  and thanked us and our sources and our work for the last four plus years exposing what happened in Magasi.
[26:43.000 --> 26:51.000]  That's a Pulitzer Prize winner. And why'd he do it? Because he wanted to point out, yes, you're on target and so am I.
[26:51.000 --> 26:57.000]  We need to get attention on this. Our military told Obama, we're not going to be part of this anymore.
[26:57.000 --> 27:04.000]  We're not going to back radical jihadis. We had a soft coup against Obama's coup.
[27:04.000 --> 27:12.000]  He writes about it in military to military and other articles and books he's written on the subject that just came out last year.
[27:12.000 --> 27:18.000]  In fact, just about a year ago, came out on January 7th, 2016.
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.000]  So when I come back, I'm just going to lay out the big facts of where we currently are.
[27:22.000 --> 27:29.000]  You know, flesh out some of the background and as much as I can tell you.
[27:29.000 --> 27:33.000]  But again, you get involved in this process and you don't even notice you're leading it.
[27:33.000 --> 27:41.000]  And I'm not saying that for credit. I'm saying so people understand you're going to get the absolute breakdown on what's currently going on
[27:41.000 --> 27:48.000]  and the war inside government. Look how it's all coming out. Leaked audio. Obama wanted ISIS to grow.
[27:48.000 --> 27:53.000]  16 hours ago. Good. Good. The leaks are starting. That's what print that for me.
[27:53.000 --> 27:57.000]  And again, I'm so busy in the fight, folks. I can't even keep track of half this.
[27:57.000 --> 28:02.000]  So understand, keep sending us the emails, keep posting articles, you know, keep making comments on the message boards.
[28:02.000 --> 28:08.000]  Help us too. People say, weren't you covering this? Too much is happening. It's a war, folks. There's a fog. We're winning.
[28:08.000 --> 28:13.000]  The enemy is routed, but it's still a war and things could turn.
[28:13.000 --> 28:18.000]  I've been saying the last week and I really intensified it yesterday, basically hysterical for three hours.
[28:18.000 --> 28:26.000]  I said, you have got to leak everything you've got now in the next 16 days, 17 days yesterday. You've got to hit them with everything.
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.000]  And I know what they've got. I mean, I know what some of the really bad stuff is.
[28:31.000 --> 28:39.000]  And I also know that it's very hard for my own safety not just get all this out because as soon as I get it all out, I'm safe.
[28:39.000 --> 28:46.000]  My family's safe. This isn't a game, folks. You're not watching a movie here. This is the real deal.
[28:46.000 --> 28:53.000]  Toe to toe with the globals. Understand? People seem to think like news is fake, but then all the fake Hollywood stuff's real.
[28:53.000 --> 28:58.000]  No, mainstream news is twisted and garbage. Hollywood's fake. This is real.
[28:58.000 --> 29:02.000]  And then I seem to have been caught in a bunch of fake news.
[29:02.000 --> 29:08.000]  But I've got to say, I've been very critical of US intelligence agencies over the years. I've been very critical of the military, as you know.
[29:08.000 --> 29:13.000]  But in the last five, six years, all of our complaining, all of our saying, do something, stand up, do the right thing.
[29:13.000 --> 29:19.000]  The military, the intelligence agencies have, they are the stars of this whole deal doing the right thing, actually.
[29:19.000 --> 29:24.000]  And upsetting the entire New World Order. And guess what? Other agencies are doing it for their nation states as well.
[29:24.000 --> 29:29.000]  It's a very exciting time to be alive. It's epic, legendary to the next level.
[29:29.000 --> 29:36.000]  Legendary to the extreme. I mean, I don't know of new words to describe because we've never been through something like this.
[29:36.000 --> 29:42.000]  But I'm going to try to take all this data and just focus it down and encapsulate it on the other side.
[29:42.000 --> 29:50.000]  Tell everybody, you know, tune in now to learn about the current civil war inside the US government for the future of the Republic.
[29:50.000 --> 30:00.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.000 --> 30:07.000]  Well, once again, Julian Assange has come out and said that Russia was not the source of the John Podesta and DNC email leaks.
[30:07.000 --> 30:14.000]  In an interview on Hannity, Assange assured Hannity and the audience that the source of the emails was not Russian or a state party.
[30:14.000 --> 30:23.000]  This comes on the heels of the Obama administration and the liberal minions digging their heels in on the Russian hacking allegations with fake news such as Russia hacked the election.
[30:23.000 --> 30:31.000]  Assange makes the keen observation that in the statement made by five different branches of the US government against the 35 Russian diplomats that were removed from the US,
[30:31.000 --> 30:40.000]  WikiLeaks was not referenced once. Back on November 9th, Obama assured President-elect Trump and the American people that he would do everything possible to make this a smooth transition.
[30:40.000 --> 30:41.000]  Someone is lying.
[30:41.000 --> 30:49.000]  So I want to be honest. It's not as if it's just Republicans who have monkeyed around with elections in the past. Sometimes Democrats have to.
[30:49.000 --> 30:52.000]  Of course the elections will not be raked. What does that mean?
[30:52.000 --> 30:56.000]  This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars and there's a war on for your mind.
[31:23.000 --> 31:26.000]  Everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[31:26.000 --> 31:36.000]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives

[32:30.000 --> 32:42.000]  So whether it's a Hillary for Prison 2017 shirt or whether it's Survival Shield X2, our super male vitality, we've got the biggest sales of 2016 right into 2017 while supplies last.
[32:42.000 --> 32:46.000]  We are selling out of many of these items because this sale is so big and we've extended it.

[32:55.000 --> 33:00.000]  That's InfowarsStore.com. Over right to the supplements at InfowarsLive.com.
[33:00.000 --> 33:16.000]  16 days from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:30.000 --> 33:45.000]  This came out a while back. The New York Times sat on the audio but now it's been re-leaked. Obama wanted ISIS to grow.
[33:45.000 --> 33:52.000]  Secret speech, John Kerry to the Syrian opposition. Of course we already knew that. We reported that first.
[33:52.000 --> 34:01.000]  Tosh Plumlee, the most famous CIA contractor ever, basically lost his job, got kicked out of it.
[34:01.000 --> 34:08.000]  And when he came on the show and got death-threaded and got visited, we're going to stop right there.
[34:08.000 --> 34:14.000]  They did all sorts of other dirty tricks that I'm not even going to get into here on air.
[34:14.000 --> 34:23.000]  But he basically had to live on a military base so they wouldn't kill him. And he broke what they really did at Benghazi first.
[34:23.000 --> 34:30.000]  Now he already, of course, had other sources in NATO, in the military, in the Delta Force. You name it.
[34:30.000 --> 34:36.000]  And then of course we had Colonel Shaffer on one week after Benghazi laying out everything that happened.
[34:36.000 --> 34:45.000]  All came out years later in congressional testimony. The stand-down orders, everything. Giving the missiles to the jihadis, then trans-ship them into Syria, everything.
[34:45.000 --> 34:52.000]  And now, there it is again, remember, remember Trump saying Hillary and Obama are the founders of ISIS?
[34:52.000 --> 34:59.000]  They even came up with the name at the White House. And that's our next story.
[34:59.000 --> 35:10.000]  I have been told that the information being held back by U.S. intelligence agencies, amongst many, is the actual memos and orders from Obama and Secretary of State Hillary
[35:10.000 --> 35:19.000]  to even create the name ISIS, Islamic State, to change the subject off the fact they were caught backing al-Qaeda because the name al-Qaeda was so shocking.
[35:19.000 --> 35:26.000]  You're like, Alex, you told us this four years ago. I know. That's what they've got in these leaks and they're going to release it.
[35:26.000 --> 35:37.000]  That's one of the things. And that's why Trump's out there telegraphing. Oh yeah, 9-11. We need to look at the Bushes of 9-11. Jeb drops out the next day.
[35:37.000 --> 35:50.000]  And then we have all this other just incredible stuff happening. Oh, Ted Cruz's daddy, CIA, boom, drops out two days later.
[35:50.000 --> 35:59.000]  What do you think? Trump's just coming up with this stuff out of a crystal ball he's got in the back room. They're all just keeps devastating him.
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.000]  Let's go ahead and play that clip. Here it is.
[36:01.000 --> 36:09.000]  Then Obama came in and normally you want to clean up. He made a bigger mess out of it. He made such a mess.
[36:09.000 --> 36:23.000]  And then you had Hillary with Libya. So sad. In fact, in many respects, you know, they honor President Obama.
[36:23.000 --> 36:36.000]  ISIS is honoring President Obama. He is the founder of ISIS. He's the founder of ISIS. He's the founder.
[36:36.000 --> 36:46.000]  He founded ISIS. And I would say the co-founder would be Crooked Hillary Clinton.
[36:46.000 --> 36:58.000]  Now, the Kerry tapes up on infowars.com. WorldNet Daily's picked it up. I believe Drudge has it. The point is that it's an hour long and we're going to get some excerpts of it and play it for you.
[36:58.000 --> 37:13.000]  But this is huge. Obama wanted ISIS to grow. Close quote. They just wanted to grow its al-Qaeda out of Saudi Arabia. It's an invasion of Syria.
[37:13.000 --> 37:20.000]  That's been declassified. And they sit there with this trillion pound creature in the living room telling us we're stupid and conspiracy theorist.
[37:20.000 --> 37:31.000]  When I have Colonel Schaefer, the former head of the anti-Al-Qaeda operation with over a thousand people under him, trying to hunt down Al-Qaeda for four years.
[37:31.000 --> 37:43.000]  And I've had, you name it, congressmen on, Walter Jones, everybody that's seen the secret documents. And if you think that's high up, imagine who I talk to on the telephone as high as it goes.
[37:43.000 --> 37:59.000]  And everybody already knows that. And I'm just telling you, folks, what you're hearing here is the absolute facts. They've got, you name it, sex crimes, pedophile airplanes, Epstein is the tip of the iceberg.
[37:59.000 --> 38:16.000]  Just the entrance to the rabbit hole of nasties. The nastiest people can imagine. Drug dealing, white slavery shipments in the Middle East. Massive drug dealing, just drugs that are poisonous being approved.
[38:16.000 --> 38:33.000]  They know are approved testing lethal pathogens on the troops. It's all. I mean, when Trump saw the stuff a few years ago from classified sources of what they're doing at the VA, he literally goes into rages, okay?
[38:33.000 --> 38:41.000]  And I'm just telling you, they're in deep trouble when he gets in. He knows everything. He knows about 9-11, all of it, all of it.
[38:41.000 --> 38:55.000]  I've had former spy masters, current spy masters, all of them tell me, look, Alex, don't worry. You watch what Trump does. I had people approach me four years ago and go, huh, Donald Trump, you know, he's going to be a big, bring down the new world order.
[38:55.000 --> 39:03.000]  Really likes what you're doing. I mean, like that guy with hotels, the guy with orange hair, because I don't watch mainstream TV. That was all just his cover folks.
[39:03.000 --> 39:11.000]  And they are frapping their drawers. So let me give you the big news right now because I got sidetracked with the other big leaks proving everything we ever said.
[39:11.000 --> 39:27.000]  I mean, Al Qaeda, ISIS front, how bombshell is that? But that segues into this, the biggest news ever. Why do you think going back four years ago when they're doing the big invasion of Syria, calling it a civil war, just like they done in Libya?
[39:27.000 --> 39:36.000]  The West starts a civil war with jihadis out of Saudi Arabia and other areas. But now in Syria, it's easier for troops to get to. They're coming in from all over the world.
[39:36.000 --> 39:58.000]  Jihadis from Russia, jihadis from America, the UK, Canada, Australia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Serbia, Albania. I mean, they're just pouring in for the big jihad to get their own house, get their own land.
[39:58.000 --> 40:07.000]  You come take the country, you get houses, swimming pools, everything, you get the businesses, the oil wells, everything that Syria ever built in thousands of years, you get it.
[40:07.000 --> 40:18.000]  Oh, we're told about Israel having a few, you know, 20 square miles or something they took. Okay, whatever. After we talk about the jihadis running wild and 5 million of them invading Europe and Merkel opening the borders up and we're getting flooded.
[40:18.000 --> 40:25.000]  After we've dealt with all that, okay, then we can moralize about Israel. It's ridiculous.
[40:25.000 --> 40:33.000]  Quite frankly, why is Israel even in Israel? It's completely surrounded by psychotic nuts that can't even get along with each other.
[40:33.000 --> 40:52.000]  But continuing, ladies and gentlemen, so Obama starts coming out four years ago and announcing that Russia is this enemy and Russia has caused all this turmoil in the Middle East and even weird stories, you know, four years ago, three years ago,
[40:52.000 --> 41:00.000]  going, oh, they're behind Al Qaeda and ISIS, but no one bought it so they backed off. So there's a kernel of truth. I'm going to give you just to be completely truthful.
[41:00.000 --> 41:07.000]  There's a kernel of truth to what Obama says from his perspective about the Russians have hacked America.
[41:07.000 --> 41:13.000]  You want to hear the big secrets? I'm just going to give them all to you right now. And you're going to go, wait a minute, this has already been the news. I know, but no one puts it together.
[41:13.000 --> 41:17.000]  And then I don't just have the pieces together. I have all the sources.
[41:17.000 --> 41:22.000]  But it's complex, but it's also very simple when you pull back and see the whole thing.
[41:22.000 --> 41:32.000]  Our military was desperate five years ago. They knew the plan. Leslie Clark even came out and talked about it. He's a liberal to take down these seven countries using radicals, destabilize the whole Middle East and flood Europe.
[41:32.000 --> 41:39.000]  It's a horrible evil plan. It's a Soros plan. That's in the WikiLeaks.
[41:39.000 --> 41:48.000]  And again, so much of what you're about to see come out in the next few days is already in the WikiLeaks, already been brought out. Now it's just going to be brought forward again.
[41:48.000 --> 41:53.000]  And new information is going to be released every day as we speak. Get ready.
[41:53.000 --> 42:02.000]  You're going to see the damn break because Obama and Hillary broke their deal with Trump. They blanked election night.
[42:02.000 --> 42:09.000]  They were told we got all the dirt on you. We know you just tried to steal these other states. You just stole these. We got people ready to come forward all the evidence. We're watching you.
[42:09.000 --> 42:16.000]  We've got almost everybody in the agency is watching you. You really have screwed the pooch. You and your operatives are cut off in your foundations.
[42:16.000 --> 42:22.000]  Don't try anything. Everything's going to be released tomorrow if you do. And so that's why Trump said, sorry, we're a little late.
[42:22.000 --> 42:28.000]  A lot of stuff going on. A lot of things happening tonight. You've been on the phone with Obama and Hillary's people.
[42:28.000 --> 42:38.000]  Hillary was throwing stuff, breaking things in a rage. We told you the next day it came out weeks later. She had to be sedated.
[42:38.000 --> 42:44.000]  They were so arrogant up at the top. They thought all these intelligence agencies and groups would follow all the criminal orders.
[42:44.000 --> 42:48.000]  When they were given the plans to hack and steal all the elections, all they did was tip off the states.
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.000]  They weren't able to stop it in every state, though. This was an incredible battle.
[42:52.000 --> 43:00.000]  Folks, Trump won the popular vote by like 10 million. But they couldn't have huge numbers of blacks and Hispanics vote.
[43:00.000 --> 43:06.000]  And they had to give you fake numbers to say, oh, he didn't convince them because they don't want blacks and Hispanics to have the victory and be part of this.
[43:06.000 --> 43:13.000]  So they put the false narrative, oh, he barely won. And oh, he got a little extra blacks and Hispanics. But no, it was a tsunami.
[43:13.000 --> 43:22.000]  It was a gigantic victory. It was huge, ginormous, a total realignment, a total repudiation.
[43:22.000 --> 43:26.000]  And they were just, uh, uh, we just lost. We stole. You're going to release all the d-
[43:26.000 --> 43:31.000]  And then they kind of hyped themselves up with Pelosi and Soros in the last few months to try.
[43:31.000 --> 43:36.000]  Well, let's try getting the electors. Well, let's try a recount. Let's try saying they're Russian spies.
[43:36.000 --> 43:45.000]  Because the truth is, the generals in our military, and again, I told you this four years ago, it came out Sy Hershey a year ago.
[43:45.000 --> 43:50.000]  Again, just, we told you over and over again, proven Sy Hershey. Boom.
[43:50.000 --> 43:55.000]  But this is so huge. I'm going to lay it out now, just there's so much background.
[43:55.000 --> 43:59.000]  There's been an internal civil war on this country inside the intelligence agencies everywhere.
[43:59.000 --> 44:03.000]  Obama and Hillary were so evil, so bad that even mercenaries and corrupt people said,
[44:03.000 --> 44:08.000]  we're not with these crazy people that want to kill prosperity and, and, and want to, you know, domesticate everybody.
[44:08.000 --> 44:11.000]  And no, it's not happening.
[44:11.000 --> 44:17.000]  American is too sexy to let a bunch of chicken-necked scumbags like Hillary walking around, having seizures everywhere.
[44:17.000 --> 44:23.000]  I mean, that, that image of her squatting on us and basically marking her territory, peeing on us, just isn't floating, okay?
[44:23.000 --> 44:29.000]  America's not going to have Obama and Hillary and Madeline Albright and all these people because they're, they're not, they don't have power.
[44:29.000 --> 44:35.000]  They're nobodies. They're cowards. They're scumbags. We're not going to sit here while you pee on us. It's just not happening.
[44:35.000 --> 44:39.000]  So that's what's happening to you. Let me explain what's about to happen.
[44:39.000 --> 44:46.000]  And I told you this months ago, and I told you this yesterday, and I'm telling you again, but now I'm going to go ahead and tell you what the information is.
[44:46.000 --> 44:52.000]  It's how you tried to steal the election. It's how you created the name ISIS to confuse the public.
[44:52.000 --> 44:59.000]  Oh yes, the Council on Foreign Relations private meetings that Hillary and John Kerry were at. You think somebody recorded those?
[44:59.000 --> 45:07.000]  You think somebody recorded those? Haas! You think we don't have people everywhere, jackass?
[45:07.000 --> 45:20.000]  That's just some of what's out there. It's all out there. So damaging, it may destroy this country, but before you're able to strangle it for sure and destroy it, it's going to be released.
[45:20.000 --> 45:30.000]  All of it. So you broke your deal with Trump, you weasels, because a lot of this probably doesn't need to come out of so bad.
[45:30.000 --> 45:38.000]  There needs to be reform, take care of how people need to be dealt with. A lot of folks need to get cancer. We're the real fast acting type. They need to agree to it.
[45:38.000 --> 45:44.000]  But no, you're going to go on to the end. You're not going to stop. You're going to try to keep trying to sabotage things once Trump gets in. We understand that.
[45:44.000 --> 45:50.000]  We know you're not going to go away. We understand you're never going to back off. We get it.
[45:50.000 --> 45:57.000]  And so Santa Claus is getting a list. He's checking it twice for who's naughty and nice.
[45:57.000 --> 46:01.000]  And so you want to have a big fight? You want to have a big civil war? Fill your hand. Go ahead.
[46:01.000 --> 46:06.000]  You don't think everybody's been running around forever getting ready for this? You stupid, arrogant people.
[46:06.000 --> 46:11.000]  You'd hijacked the top of the country. You'd looted us. You'd robbed the Seven Ways of Sunday, but you had to rub it in.
[46:11.000 --> 46:15.000]  You had to get up on TV like a bunch of megalomaniacs and go, and your kids belong to us and the state.
[46:15.000 --> 46:18.000]  And we ripped you off of Obamacare and got the public stuff.
[46:18.000 --> 46:25.000]  A bunch of weird chicken neck Harvard guys having little wimp celebrations about how they destroyed America and how they were better than us.
[46:25.000 --> 46:29.000]  Yeah, you're about to find out. So here's the big announcement just in total.
[46:29.000 --> 46:35.000]  Is this a labyrinth of evidence?
[46:35.000 --> 46:40.000]  The globalists are losing everywhere. People don't want this tyrannical new world order global government model.
[46:40.000 --> 46:44.000]  We're not even debating whether the world government's good or bad. Let's just cut that out for academic reasons.
[46:44.000 --> 46:51.000]  This world government is nothing but a corporate looting arm, which admits once a post-industrial world, the end of nation states,
[46:51.000 --> 46:59.000]  only trade corridors, 99% of stuff collapses, and then the elites have high-tech city states that are heavily guarded and controlled,
[46:59.000 --> 47:04.000]  and everybody else lives in squalor, and people say, oh, there's a movie about that. There's books, Hunger Games.
[47:04.000 --> 47:11.000]  I told you this 20 years ago. I put it in films 15 years ago. No, that's art imitating life, folks.
[47:11.000 --> 47:16.000]  Not life now.
[47:16.000 --> 47:21.000]  Imitating art. It's art imitating life. It's what's going on.
[47:21.000 --> 47:30.000]  So here's the big announcement. In summation, WikiLeaks and a whole bunch of other groups. WikiLeaks is just some branding name
[47:30.000 --> 47:34.000]  and one major clearinghouse of folks that have been going over all this stuff and have the courage to do it.
[47:34.000 --> 47:41.000]  That's kind of what we are as well, but them doing even a higher level when it comes to the documents themselves, because I won't touch the things.
[47:41.000 --> 47:48.000]  You start getting these real things. You start getting followed around. You start getting guys beating up in parking lots.
[47:48.000 --> 47:50.000]  You start getting hit on the head.
[47:50.000 --> 47:56.000]  So there's nothing I'm even afraid of that. It's that people didn't even care when I got secret documents,
[47:56.000 --> 47:59.000]  because I was just some guy on a few radio stations like, oh, yeah, that's not real.
[47:59.000 --> 48:03.000]  The point is, is Assange got big journalists behind him with a lot of credibility.
[48:03.000 --> 48:08.000]  And so now we're sitting here watching this total war with 16 days out.
[48:08.000 --> 48:11.000]  Obama and the globalists desperately want to keep Trump out of office.
[48:11.000 --> 48:15.000]  Globalism is failing all over the world. Nationalism and populism is surging.
[48:15.000 --> 48:20.000]  The elite in every major publication admit to themselves they are burning down in the day.
[48:20.000 --> 48:26.000]  Babylon's burning in a day. I mean, the next few years is like a minute in the scheme of human history.
[48:26.000 --> 48:34.000]  So a day is like a year.
[48:34.000 --> 48:39.000]  It's just amazing. It's so mind boggling. So there's this war going on currently.
[48:39.000 --> 48:43.000]  And they've told him, OK, all this horrible stuff. We don't want to release more.
[48:43.000 --> 48:48.000]  Stop it. Admit your beat. Back off. Let us cut the taxes. Let us resuscitate the country.
[48:48.000 --> 48:55.000]  Just stop this ritual of abusing America for your own personal weird leftist mind control. Stop it.
[48:55.000 --> 49:00.000]  And they went, OK, we're going to stop it. And then came right back attacking.
[49:00.000 --> 49:04.000]  Behind the scenes and now publicly. And so when they say, oh, there's Russian agents hacked us,
[49:04.000 --> 49:11.000]  the kernel of truth is our military and our patriots checkmated Obama with the proof of this
[49:11.000 --> 49:16.000]  and said, you let us now take these groups out or we're going to release all the info.
[49:16.000 --> 49:20.000]  And again, Obama said, OK, I will, but then always sabotage the missions. It's the same deal.
[49:20.000 --> 49:23.000]  OK, I'll back off, but then he never really does.
[49:23.000 --> 49:26.000]  They've been through this six or seven times now with Obama and the globalists.
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  So the Russians said, OK, we'll talk to your military.
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  Sure, we'll talk to your chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  Sure, we'll talk to all the heads of your military.
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.000]  Oh, you want us to come in? You know, we're already there.
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  You know, we're already losing thousands of troops every few months.
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  Oh, sure, you're not going to give us a problem if Air Force comes in.
[49:38.000 --> 49:41.000]  OK, we'll divide the country in three parts. We'll even go with your previous plan.
[49:41.000 --> 49:45.000]  Sure, we just want to stop World War III. Boom, we're coming in. They come in.
[49:45.000 --> 49:51.000]  And they join US military forces now there who know everything they do has been given to the ISIS people
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  days beforehand.
[49:53.000 --> 49:58.000]  So now the military started doing tests in the last year, giving false info back to the Pentagon,
[49:58.000 --> 50:01.000]  knowing they've got moles inside there from Soros,
[50:01.000 --> 50:07.000]  and then they're even using that in disinfo to get the ISIS people to attack the wrong spot.
[50:07.000 --> 50:11.000]  And they're like, oh my God, Obama is feeding intelligence directly to ISIS.
[50:11.000 --> 50:19.000]  Well, of course he is. Saudi intelligence and the Chinese intelligence basically runs that thing.
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.000]  We've got congressmen introducing bills to stop funding ISIS.
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  We have Democrats coming out and speaking out as well.
[50:24.000 --> 50:32.000]  We have Democrats coming out saying, Obama, we got hacked two years ago in the big giant pack of all time.
[50:32.000 --> 50:38.000]  14 million US governments names, infos, code names, everything, all their operatives, total roll-up.
[50:38.000 --> 50:41.000]  There's no way they just got that. You gave it to them, didn't you?
[50:41.000 --> 50:47.000]  Oh, that's right. Oh, the Russians are getting us. Oh, the Russians, Obama rolled up our entire intelligence network worldwide
[50:47.000 --> 50:52.000]  with the Chikoms. That's why the intelligence agencies are in total war mode against Obama,
[50:52.000 --> 51:01.000]  because they realize it's a triple cross, and the enemy's got 16 days to try to stop us from restoring the Republic.
[51:01.000 --> 51:04.000]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
[51:04.000 --> 51:08.000]  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[51:08.000 --> 51:12.000]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[51:12.000 --> 51:17.000]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks and head-to-head fitness tests.
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  How is this even possible?
[51:19.000 --> 51:26.000]  Turns out, the old guys in this unit had been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[51:26.000 --> 51:31.000]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints,
[51:31.000 --> 51:34.000]  stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[51:34.000 --> 51:39.000]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units, but for a limited time,
[51:39.000 --> 51:45.000]  the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[51:45.000 --> 51:48.000]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.
[51:48.000 --> 51:54.000]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to green75.com.

[59:26.000 --> 59:31.000]  This unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[59:31.000 --> 59:36.000]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[59:36.000 --> 59:43.000]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[59:43.000 --> 59:46.000]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure.
[59:46.000 --> 59:49.000]  At civilwarslife.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[59:49.000 --> 59:56.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  Again, the last 30 minutes I let out a lot of the history of what's happening.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  I laid out what's currently going on and it's all just in public view.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  It's just amazing how accurate my sources were five years ago, four years ago, three years ago, two years ago, right through to the last few days.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  That there is a major civil war going on and that the leaks are from US intelligence mainly.
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  The Russians were behind the whole carbon tax leak because that was affecting them six years ago and the whole UN treaty that was shot down in flames.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  And so they're attempting to have false flags claiming Russians are killing power plants.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  They're putting up fake videos on CNN.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  They've been caught.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  That's coming up, running fake video of the Russian hackers saying they have footage of them hacking to brainwash their mindless idiot viewers.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  This is just an epic time to be alive right now.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  And we have the leaked audio of caring.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  And you need to also retweet that everybody from real Alex Jones because it's so important.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  And we have Julian Assange to Hannity source for WikiLeaks, not Russian.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  And Assange never comes out about his sources.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  He says that clearly, clearly.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  This is an attempt to delegitimize Trump.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be going over all of this today in detail right now.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  Let's just back to back.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  Let's play first Assange saying they're trying to delegitimize Trump.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  And then let, which is clear, it's like saying the sky is blue, and then let's get into the next Assange piece where he lays out the fact that his source is not Russian for the big hacked emails of Hillary.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  Our publications had wide uptake by the American people.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  They're all true.
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  But that's not the allegation that has been presented by the Obama White House.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  So why such a dramatic response?
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  Well, the reason is obvious.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  They're trying to delegitimize Trump administration as it goes into the White House.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  They're going to try, they are trying to say that President-elect Trump is not a legitimate president.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  Can you say to the American people unequivocally that you did not get this information about the DNC, John Podesta's emails.
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  Can you tell the American people a thousand percent you did not get it from Russia or anybody associated with Russia?
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  We can say and we have said repeatedly over the last two months that our source is not the Russian government and it is not state party.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  So this is Hillary and Obama's last warning.
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  The fact that Assange has come out and said it's not the Russians.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  The fact that he talked about the DNC staffer that got shot four times in the back being one of their sources.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  The fact that Obama is moving forward trying to start a war with Russia tells you how much danger we're in.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  They may start a major war.
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  They're trying to sell one.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  All this war hysteria you see is just that.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  And what's crazy is the average liberal is really a low information voter who's super stupid.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  We all know every time you see a car driving slow in the fast lane, it's always liberal.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  They usually have a bumper sticker on their car or whatever that says it.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  Because they're just idiots.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  They just buy into all the hype and they're fighting racist and homophobes and Trump's waving a rainbow flag.
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  I mean, they don't even know what planet they're on, okay?
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  An NPR is like let's have war with Russia channel.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  And so they're all just running around doing Russian scum, Russian scum infiltrated.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  Our country got taken over by a multinational combine financed by the globalist.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  Financed by the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, Soros, allied with the Communist Chinese who were so arrogant.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  They chew Obama out when he gets out on the tarmac because they have deals.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  And the military told him, you're going to square up to China, but we're going to release everything.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  So he's trying to placate the military and the Americana Patriots while the Soros people are ordering him to do all this.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  But the point of the Chinese, they get him off the back of the plane and they chew him out on the tarmac.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  And they hack us and steal all the data because Obama gives it to them and they're blackmailing him with that.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  And they just, they steal the sub and Obama grovels because they got all the dirt on him.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  The Clintons have always been Chinese operatives.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  The Clintons are on the payroll of the Communist Chinese publicly.
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  Well, once again, Julian Assange has come out and said that Russia was not the source of the John Podesta and DNC email leaks.
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  In an interview on Hannity, Assange assured Hannity and the audience that the source of the emails was not Russian or a state party.
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  This comes on the heels of the Obama administration and the liberal minions digging their heels in on the Russian hacking allegations with fake news such as Russia hacked the election.
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  Assange makes the keen observation that in the statement made by five different branches of the US government against the 35 Russian diplomats that were removed from the US, WikiLeaks was not referenced once.
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  Back on November 9th, Obama assured President-elect Trump and the American people that he would do everything possible to make this a smooth transition. Someone is lying.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  So I want to be honest. It's not as if it's just Republicans who have monkeyed around with elections in the past. Sometimes Democrats have to.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  Of course the elections will not be rigged. What does that mean?
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars and there's a war on for your mind.

[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  I don't know how this is going to end, New World Order, but you want to have a fight, better believe you've got one.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  I want to salute all the patriots that are watching and listening to this broadcast who've been fighting tyranny for so long.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  I want to salute everybody out there that has been getting ridiculed and attacked for decades, exposing the globalist program so that now, as they tried to go full operational, everybody had been warned over and over again and made fun of us and now they know,
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  oh, it wasn't a joke, it was real and now the tide is turning just like that and the weight of this is so seismic, so historical, it is bone crushing.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  Liberty always trumps tyranny if we decide we want it.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  Now, I've got Q Carter and of course Patrick Riley, two of my good friends, they work here at InfoWars, with some big announcements here that was planned for weeks.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  But I'm going to recap the top stories, what's coming up and then Dr. Steve Pacinac, former head of psychological warfare, I'll just say it, it's not a secret at the Central Intelligence Agency, not the State Department,
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  is going to be joining us coming on and of course he's obviously not out of the CIA.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  It's just kind of be public about all this.
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  Okay, the point is he wants to come on, he's going to come on.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  They've got a bunch of other sources, even more high level than him, with everything that's happening, there is a giant counter coup going on right now against the globalist ally of China in Saudi Arabia that hijacked the country.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  They're starting to try a huge war with Russia.
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  You've got a huge media war trying to suppress this, trying to shut up the American people, trying to bring in all this tyranny.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  And they're failing, so there is a civil war going on.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  They've got 16 days trying to stop this, they're trying to start a war with Russia, they're trying to openly shut down the Free Paris, they've passed laws to do it.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  They're acting and behaving as if Trump isn't even going to be there, okay?
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  And Trump knows that.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  But the good news is almost everybody in the 16 intelligence agencies knows exactly what's going on right now.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  They know the country's on its deathbed if we don't beat these people.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  So the delusionals, they call us deplorables, the delusionals, inside the Obama administration and their camp followers at the CFR need to know there are massive data dumps that make what WikiLeaks released before,
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  there's stuff ten times worse, okay? You want to know what some of the stuff I've been told by multiple level sources is in there?
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  Hillary being told what to do by the Chinese president, there's phone calls, there's emails, there's communiques, there's couriers, they've had it for decades.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  The Clintons are communist agents through Don Tyson and Tyson Chicken, that's what the Chinese are experts at, is infiltrating through business.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  They don't just get money from the Chinese, they're Chinese communist agents, okay?
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  And I've been told that by people in defense intelligence, CIA, and folks, I don't just mean like your low level analyst or these rich kids that go to Harvard or Yale and run around and talk to their sleeve and stuff.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  I mean the real people that overthrow governments, you name it.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  They're Chinese communist agents, they had a plan to double cross America, they thought they had us, that's why they're so arrogant.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  Everything we do is a plan to demoralize us and make us feel weak and pathetic. It didn't work.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  Am I perfect? Is Trump perfect? No. Are any of us perfect? No.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  But the truth is we love this country and we want to cut taxes, we want prosperity, we want to say America's open for business again.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  We don't want to make you poor, so you're controlled.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  I am an individual, no agencies, no connections, none of that. Just a real person fighting for 21 years.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  And over time, because of you, the audience, we built the network of people with the intelligence and the understanding to take action anywhere in the world.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  And to feed key information back through the internet to where now we see Reddit and the Donald and thousands of other sites and groups putting out even better field intelligence than what the government agencies can do.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  We're in a war, folks, and I studied information war and how communists and others have been defeated.
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  And I simply took that on air reading books myself because I sat there in college hearing how bad America was, how our founders were bad, how guns were bad, how families were bad, and how we were going to be broken.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  And I decided 25 years ago that I was going to get on air and I was going to come after them.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  Well, now a lot of other people are coming after the New World Order. And the tides turning, they're scared, but here's the problem.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  They're planning something big. That's why they need to know.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  I was told over a year ago that WikiLeaks had all this extra data and that if it didn't defeat Hillary, it would all be brought out.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  If she would have gotten elected or stolen, it would have released that week before she even, you know, get all of her news shutting down and the rest of it.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  Obama was going to start a war. They were going to clamp down the press. They were going to do false flags. They had this whole thing planned.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  The problem is everything they do gets leaked. All their groups are penetrated. Their foreign merc groups are penetrated.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  The Islamic groups they bring in that the Justice Department orders FBI to follow. The FBI is ignoring your orders.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  You are blown wide open. You're dead on arrival. You're bleeding out politically.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  The light's going out of your eyes. Realize you're politically dead. Back off now.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  Back off now before the real guns and hammers come out. You've only got a few days to signal this and then really do it.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  Because if you just signal you're going to halfway do it and then double cross, like you always do, the hammer is out.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  It's over your head right now. Make one last move that's wrong. It's all going to be released on you.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  You understand? Now, most people are scared to get up on air and say all this. I will tell you what's really going on.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  And believe me, the White House is listening right now.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  I've been watching their body language, everything they're doing. They're scared.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  Because, let me tell you, what you just heard is the God's honest truth.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  I mean, the other stuff that reportedly Wiggy Lee says, Scott, it's just you name it, it's there.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  When you read this, the stuff they've released, how nasty they are. I want to screw people over.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  Maybe people pour, oh, yeah. How do we make them desperate? Oh, yeah.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  It's like a bunch of demons competing with each other who could be the nastiest filth on earth.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  It's beyond any Hollywood movie you've ever seen. It is the worst of the worst.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  Imagine the best of the best. Creates a spirit of just being good and honorable and strong and winning.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  And they don't like that. These are little horrible creatures.
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  Now, Dr. Steve Pacanik is going to join us.
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  And he's really such big stuff on the show that the FBI shows up at its house or the CIA shows up at its house.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  You better shut up. But now there's so many people, as he says, upstairs that are fully behind defeating the globalists now,
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  that there has been a revolution inside these agencies to fully re-adopt Americana.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  It's not like they adopted something or Ron Paul or something that we just came up with.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  We never turned our back on America. I come from America.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  I didn't realize I just grew up out of what was left of it.
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  I thought everybody was like this. And we're returning it. We're restoring it.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  And it's going to happen. And Russia knows that.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  That's why Russia's standing down when their airplanes are getting blown up every week,
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  their ambassadors are getting killed every week, their diplomats are being killed almost every day.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  There's all sorts of stuff going on as they hold on trying to stop a war.
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  The Chinese may start a war in the next 16 days.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  That's why they keep giggling and going, yeah, he's not in yet. Something with China.
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  They're like, listen, listen, Michael Moore, you piece of crap.
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  Stop trying to sit around and pretend like you're some master villain. That's Soros.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  Okay, stop it. But it's a bunch of Hollywood people and others playing God.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  I'm going to skip this network break so we have more time.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  And I'm going to just segue into something very, very exciting that we're going to break down here
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  that I've been planning for months.
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  We've got some b-roll we're going to roll.
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  If you're a radio listener, you should go to infowars.com.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  We'll also archive this later today so people can see it.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  This is amazing.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  I've never carried guns and firearms accessories and body armor intakes because it's a minefield.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  It's hard to get the best stuff and the top companies can sell so much that they don't want to deal with it.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:02.000]  But because of what's happened in the election and everything we've done and the connections we have,
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  a lot of major defense contractors that have been lobbying to be able to get the stuff that American people are now working with infowars.
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  And the next day, I'm going to announce three.
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  Well, two of them are big contractors.
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  One of them is the original producing lowers that everybody else copies here in the United States.
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  But two of them are big defense contractors with the contracts, you name it,
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  and you're about to get stuff for the first time only available to the military now, to the people of the United States.
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  And Quentin Carter has been instrumental with all his contacts and all his tours, the military and Blackwater previously and other groups and the rest of it.
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  And of course, Patrick Rowley is working hard on this as well.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:44.000]  We've got one big announcement now, later in the third hour, another huge announcement that is just ginormous.
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  But this one undoubtedly is the biggest.
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  The future is here.
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  Quentin, tell folks about it.
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  Basically, what we're bringing to the info wars team is a new line of dynamic lightweight body armor.
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  It's nanotube technology.
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:06.000]  It's created here in Texas.
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable and stronger than anything else on the market.
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  We've went out into some testing.
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  Obviously, they've been tested by the Department of Defense.
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  We just did it for ourselves and for people to see it.
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  It's better than what they even say.
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:28.000]  Right.
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, could be so strong.
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  So what we did is we went out, we asked others in the community, other special operations to do some testing with us.
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  And they came back with high regards.
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  So we went out and did it among ourselves.
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  We used different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the info war store.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  And I want to just make a point here.
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  This is a unicorn, but so is a cell phone.
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  So is penicillin if you didn't have before 1944.
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  Absolutely.
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  This is the Buck Roger development.
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  This was developed in Texas, the University of Texas over the last decade.
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  And I mean, folks, we're talking about stuff that cost $150 for the lower price systems.
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  It's insane.
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  And so folks are shooting these with what the Desert Eagle 50, and it's not going through the Defense Department is getting them right now.
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  And that's all obviously secretive.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:43.000]  So these are developing stuff that even stops high velocity rifle rounds right now.
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  This is for up to what's the particular variance of the 50 50.
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  And we were shooting pistol ammo through carbines, and it wasn't going through as well.
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:19:00.000]  So when we originally were talking to the manufacturer and distributor, they're like, hey, the only people we're selling it to currently are law enforcement and border patrol.
[1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  And we asked, basically, can we get in this?
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:03.000]  We want to see it.
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:04.000]  And we asked for the documents.
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  And it's one of those things that's amazing.
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  Let's be clear.
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  This is national defense labs and then there's subsidiary citizen armor.
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  Yeah, they're only letting us sell this to the public because they love us.
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:13.000]  Yeah.
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  And again, you know, they sent us the video.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:16.000]  Of course, you know, we saw the video.
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  It's hard to believe on film.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:20.000]  I cannot judge about this enough.
[1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  People ask, what's all the secret stuff the military's got that nobody's heard about?
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  And then it takes decades to get to the public.
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  This is it, folks.
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  I mean, what's insane is this is less than stuff that weighs five to seven times more and does a better job.
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  This is insane.
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  Now, Alex allows us to do some cool stuff frequently.
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  But let me tell you, this is one of the funnest things I've ever, ever, ever, ever able to do.
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  And it's one of those things that I mean, heck, we're going to keep doing it.
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  And as a new technology rolls out, we're going to blast it.
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  Oh, Pat.
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  Pat never's a loss for words.
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  He's doing a good job up here from about a million people watching right now.
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  I'm nervous not.
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  No, no, you're doing a good job.
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:54.000]  But the important thing is why not be nervous when I'm talking about products that are quality.
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  Lucky leprechaun.
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  Absolutely.
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  You want me to get my suit on?
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:19:58.000]  Absolutely.
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:01.000]  But I mean, again, we've got all kinds of amazing products from citizen armor.
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:03.000]  We've got bat pack inserts.
[1:20:03.000 --> 1:20:04.000]  We've got concealed vests.
[1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:05.000]  We've got tactical vests.
[1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:06.000]  We've got bat packs and hydration.
[1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:12.000]  We have their entire line because it's only available from the citizens armoring and us.
[1:20:12.000 --> 1:20:16.000]  And again, and again, they are just setting this up to begin getting it to the public.
[1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:18.000]  We are in at the very ground level.
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:22.000]  This has been around for over a decade in all sorts of let's just say clandestine things,
[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  but now it's moving in to the rifle rounds and being able to stop that.
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:27.000]  In fact, that's what they're looking at.
[1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:32.000]  Something twice as thick as this basically stops any rifle around, but they're not ready to say that yet.
[1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  But you put this in the backpack, it has the backpack inserts, 150 bucks for the small.
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  It's 175 over the medium, with 200 for the large.
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  Right.
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:41.000]  This is just insane.
[1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  And let's be clear.
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  This isn't one of these dummies that we've got when you're watching the video where you shoot it and it's cosmetic or rubber and it closes up.
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  This is Bob, the MMA dummy that, well, my mom had one, she was in the kickboxing and I shot it up at a test we did.
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  And then she said, I want another one.
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  And then I bought her a new Bob and she didn't want it.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  She was out of boxing at that time.
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  I was like, I guess she heard her eye or something and got sick of it.
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  So it's been sitting over there in the warehouse in the storage area for about three years.
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  And so we got it.
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  You took it out there.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  It's got one little knife when we were testing on it.
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  That's right.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  And let's be clear, the shirt on the other side, when we were shooting it with the pistol ammo in a carbine, which they claim it's not even rated to, was not going through.
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  We had to cut out the slugs, but it did hit the shirt hard enough to make the shirt that the thin little tactical shirt start deteriorating.
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  So you'll feel like you got kicked by a mule like any other body armor.
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  But you won't be dead.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  You won't be dead.
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  I mean, it's incredible.
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  Tell us about this because I cannot hide how incredible game changing over the top, insane, the low price, the fact that we've got the exclusive, the fact that I've got a huge factory right here in America created and designed and discovered, invented in Texas.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:54.000]  I mean, this is awesome.
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  Born in Texas, made America exclusively available at m4warstore.com right now.
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  I mean, it's got a 20 year warranty is waterproof.
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  You can wear it.
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight that we all carry.
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  What's it weight?
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  Like four pounds?
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  No, not even a pound.
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  Less than a pound.
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  Yeah, very long.
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  So when we say regular body armor is five times more, we're just, what is a 10 times more heavy?
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  The backpack insert is significantly less lightweight than a typical laptop that would go in your bag.
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  So what's the tactical way?
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  The tactical vest depends different ways.
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  Maybe.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  Yeah, maybe.
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  We have their full line.
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  We have the systems where you can add augmented plates if you want.
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  Absolutely.
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  This is the insert that we feel tested at 21 feet.
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  And by the way, it's almost twice the size of the regular plates.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:51.000]  That's right.
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  I'm not small at all and you can see it covers my entire body.
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  How big a deal would have this been when you were in Afghanistan, when you were in Iraq, when you were in Africa, everywhere?
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  Well, it would have made them 50 pounds lighter.
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  It definitely made it a lot easier to operate.
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  How much body armor did you wear there?
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  80, 85 pounds on a regular basis.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  So to be able to change from modern steel plates to something so lightweight, breathable and flexible.
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  Flexible is the big part.
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  To be able to move without having a steel plate that basically restricts your movement as a whole is a big difference.
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  But this is something that your children, your family can put in a backpack.
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  They don't even know what it is.
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  It doesn't alert your child.
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  She doesn't think like, hey, something's wrong.
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:37.000]  Dad put something in my backpack that makes it heavy.
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  You can put this in a backpack.
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  She doesn't even know what it is.
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  He doesn't know what it is.
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  And in the case that there was ever something goes wrong, they simply put their backpack in front of them and move out.
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  Absolutely.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  Well, I think you tell them, though, if somebody's running around with a gun, cover your head up.
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  Absolutely.
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  And you tell them, you know, if there's something happens here and you're leaving there, leave your backpack on.
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  It'll protect your back.
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  It protects your vital organs.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  We shot this with a nine millimeter plus P from 21 feet.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  The reason that's cuts that as you guys cut the fact, in fact, for TV viewers, there's some a b-roll, but there's also audio.
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  We're going to play coming up.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  You can see where they dig the bullets out and cut the bullets out.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  It didn't even cut when it hit.
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  It just goes and stops.
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  And I've got some of the bullets right here to your left.
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  What I have.
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  I mean, it's pretty cool.
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  You know, it's sitting here digging.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  Completely mushroom.
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  Look at this.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  In fact, document camera here, guys.
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  Thanks.
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  Keep going.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  Yeah.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  So I mean, again, it's pretty amazing.
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  As of right now, they're still testing new fibers that's going to potentially stop up to 308 rounds.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  I mean, this is how impressive this new technology is.
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  Nanotube technology, super thin, a quarter inch thick, very comfortable to wear.
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  I want to show folks, this is what was shot through your, it's not an MP5.
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  What's it?
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  It's a variant.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  It's a SIG MPX.
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  It's an MP5.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  It's a SIG MP5, not an HK.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  Correct.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  And I don't know all the different groups.
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  Look at this hydroshock.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  I mean, look, you shot it completely mushroom.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  That's a 90% mushroom.
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  Correct.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  That's because it's a rifle.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  And the video does a lot.
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  I mean, I hated to cut this up, but I love to see that it stopped.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  I mean, I could feel through the armor with my fingers that the round completely stopped
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  on the outside of the armor.
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  I mean, completely amazing.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  Bob wasn't hurt.
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  Don't worry.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  Bob's safe.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  He's home back here at Infowars.
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  Somebody stabbed him though.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  I saw that.
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  Well, we picked the hottest.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  He's not stabbed.
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  Nine millimeter plus P rounds that we could find.
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  We shot it with full metal jacket.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  We shot it with Hornady critical defense.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  Look, it even broke the full metal jacket.
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  Absolutely.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  The nine mil and 40 stopped it at 21 feet, which shows that there was so much kinetic
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  energy that the lead pushed through.
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  Even the front of the brass went around to the nanotech tube.
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  And if you, and if you look at this, I mean, I don't want to.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  We're always hearing nanotechs can do all this incredible stuff, but I barely had to
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  open this.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  And that's the one thing.
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  Don't cut yours up if you shoot it because obviously you don't want to breathe nanotech.
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  Okay.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  The point is, and again, it will stop.
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  It will make you safe and you will live.
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  The damage that was placed here is not any of it from being shot.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  That's from us wanting to recover the projectiles.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  So 21st century is here.
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  It is.
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  Absolutely.
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  Buck Rogers.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  I mean, obviously I've told you guys and for years I've tried to get body armor companies
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  and it's either too much or we sell so much of it that they can't keep in supply and then
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  they use us to brand themselves, but then don't stay with us.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  We need to find our operations selling things like water filters, body armor, seeds, everything
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  we sell is what we use that is the best that gives life.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  And I think this totally fits into that family.
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  And then when I learned a cube from all your sources and contacts that, you know, that these
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  folks are patriots, that they want to work with us.
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  This is a big deal.
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  So I want to thank National Defense Laboratories for letting us do this deal.
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  Absolutely.
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  The other big deal is you're giving an injury recovery offer right now.
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  We can't do this offer for long.
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  I don't know how long you're going to keep this going, but these rates will go up.
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  So they got to get them now.
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  Yeah, let's be clear that a lot of body armor groups put up four or five time markups.
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  They went, one of the deals was they said, we want this to be affordable to everybody.
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  We said, Hey, match made in heaven.
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  You know, we want you to have a moderate profit.
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  We have some profit.
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  This is not marked up very much.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I mean, we're talking 150 bucks.
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  I mean, that's crazy.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  I see people charging 300, 400 just for the plates and a little bag to hang in and around your neck.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  I mean, that's, I mean, look at this.
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  Can still best look a low profile. This is we have a shirt that goes over it like a typical workout shirt.
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  But I mean, look how thin this is.
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  We have the footage of us cutting into this and digging the bullets.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  Can we show that?
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  But I mean, again, show the good side.
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  That's not too shot up again.
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  But that is very thin.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  And I mean, we were shot this up.
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  We were apprehensive when we saw the video obviously showed that it stopped the rounds.
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  And then when we shot this, we couldn't believe that we are shooting in the exact same spot,
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  the best that we could from 21 feet away.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  And it stopped the bullets repeatedly one after one after one.
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  Sure. Well, we have the b-roll too.
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  Because I know I saw it last night.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  It's at the end of the clip.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  It's at the end of the clip.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  Can we show it at the end of the clip?
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  It shows them digging the bullets out at the end of the clip.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  You can also see where the round hit right here.
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  You can see where it hit the foam.
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  You can see where it started to penetrate the first layer of clothing.
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  Put it down here.
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  This is better light.
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  And then you can see that it did not.
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  I mean, what an amazing technology.
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  The very first layer.
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  Now, you guys are always calm about stuff and play stuff down to you.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  I guess that's kind of the army, you know, quite professional way.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  But you said when you talk to people that have been using this,
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  actually testing it for years and people that currently are testing it for us,
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  they didn't just say outstanding.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  What did they really say about this?
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  No, this is through the roof.
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  They want to know how do they get it?
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  Where do they find it?
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  Because they're wearing these big, heavy, bulky vests that don't work as well.
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  So they're looking for something you can wear all day,
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  12 hours a day in and out of a car.
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  And 90, I mean, you can look at the numbers.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  90 plus percent fatalities with guns when they're using additional crime.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  I think it's like 94 is pistols or shotguns.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  This stops that unless it's a slug.
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  I mean, that's amazing.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  So they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle rounds going to get through it.
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  And soon they will have it.
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:57.000]  If it's available to civilians, they're not sure.
[1:28:57.000 --> 1:29:00.000]  We're going to have the stuff that's unstoppable, basically.
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  And as you said, you know, we're walking through a landmine.
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  We have people beating down our doors,
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  trying to get us to distribute and sell their products.
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:07.000]  And we don't want the regular stuff.
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  We want the cutting edge best of the best.
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  By far, this is the most impressive that I have ever seen.
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  And it's less money than the other stuff out there that weighs 80 pounds.
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:17.000]  We get tens of people calling us all the time saying,
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  hey, distribute this product, sell this product for us.
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:22.000]  If it's crap, we don't touch it. This is the best.
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:24.000]  Available at infostore.com.
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  Wow.
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  A tactical nanotechnology body armor.
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:30.000]  Previously only available to military and law enforcement.
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  Now exclusively available.
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  It's been tested by the New Mexico State Police and a lot of others,
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  and they are adopting it.
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:38.000]  And it's already being tested by the Pentagon, the rifle stuff,
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  but they didn't want to even get into that.
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:42.000]  Don't forget, you know, you bought a bunch of backpack inserts for your family,
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:44.000]  you know, put them in everybody's backpack.
[1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  And you're funding the InfoWare that is defending this Republic.
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  Q, Pat, great job. InfoWareStore.com or call toll free.
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:53.000]  Triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. Great job.
[1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:03.000]  Let's take a look at some of the headlines.

[1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:53.000]  What magic wand do you have?
[1:30:53.000 --> 1:30:56.000]  And usually the answer is you don't have an answer.
[1:30:56.000 --> 1:31:00.000]  This is Owen Schreuer from Magic Wandland.
[1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:02.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:04.000]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:07.000]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[1:31:07.000 --> 1:31:13.000]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:18.000]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking
[1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:22.000]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.

[1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:35.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:38.000]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:40.000]  The general public doesn't.
[1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:44.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:48.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:51.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older,
[1:31:51.000 --> 1:31:54.000]  more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:59.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today and then fullwarstore.com.
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:28.000]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:30.000]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  These are all parasites.
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:34.000]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  You have the neem in there.
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:42.000]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:43.000]  All right.
[1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:45.000]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:46.000]  It just came back in yesterday.
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:48.000]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com.

[1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:57.000]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[1:32:57.000 --> 1:33:26.000]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:31.000]  16 days.
[1:33:31.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  16 days until the rebirth of the Republic stock market sub.
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  $1 trillion, $200 billion.
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:42.000]  Now over $100 billion in new investment announced for just this year.
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  And it's begun.
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  Trump is now demanding all the documents about the open borders
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:51.000]  and who was given what orders for the stand downs
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:55.000]  and to pass people in that had leprosy and TB, which is a felony.
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  And the new attorney general is going to go after them.
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  Jeff Sessions.
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:03.000]  They are crapping their pants.
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:06.000]  And with 16 days left, they're trying to start a war with Russia.
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  They're trying to turn jihadis loose all over Europe and the United States.
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  This is a dangerous time to be alive, but also a very exciting time to be alive.
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:15.000]  I've got a lot of sources as everybody knows.
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  I'm not bragging.
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  We broke the Benghazi first with Colonel Shaffer and many others,
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  like Dr. Steve Pachennick, Tosh Plumlee, from the guy on the C-130.
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  He's been high up in government agencies, you name it.
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  We're going to him here in just a moment.
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  But from my sources, and I mean a lot of them, and I've been getting this for over a year.
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  In fact, I had sources over a year ago.
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  Alex, it's not the Russians, because I was asking.
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  They go, no, it's U.S. intelligence agencies.
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  We even know who.
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  Now we've had British ambassadors and others that have gone to New York,
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  gone to D.C., met with the actual leakers.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  The leakers represent the U.S. intelligence agencies.
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  Dr. Steve Pachennick, who has his sources, obviously, was able to come on
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  before the election and say, this is a counter coup.
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  That is correct.
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  It's happening.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  And now they're waiting.
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  If Obama does much more, and if Hillary and Soros do much more,
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  and they're crazy, if they do much more, then they're going to release Hillary
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  and the Council on Foreign Relations with Kerry four-plus years ago,
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  branding Al Qaeda as ISIS.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  They're going to release stuff from the last year,
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  where they've been caught commanding the ISIS forces and giving intelligence to them,
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  which our military already knows is going on.
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  It's all going to come out.
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  Narcotics trafficking, money laundering, 30 years of the Clintons being on the
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  Communist Chinese payroll from the time they worked with Don Tyson,
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  who was heavy in with the Chai comms as well.
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  So you want it all to come out?
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  Democratic Party, look, you want it all to come out?
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  It's about to come out.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  And the Republican establishment is just as bad.
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  It's all the same group.
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  They're trying to block Trump.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  You've got that weasel running around the Speaker of the House,
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  Paul Ryan saying, I agree.
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  It's the Russians.
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  We need to, you know, get tough on them.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  And they might have helped Trump.
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  This is the most treasonous garbage.
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  All that ever happened was what Dr. Pachennik said and what Tosh Plumlee said
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  and what Colonel Schaefer said.
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  And then all the folks I talked to off record, including generals,
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  including generals that you see Trump putting in.
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  And Sye Hirsch coming on here a year ago to give a nod to the audience
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  and the rest of the media and say, this is accurate information.
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  The only Russian operation that there's been was that our military
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  and the Joint Chief said, we're telling Obama this isn't happening.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  We'd be given a tacit approval to block it because Obama knew
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  he couldn't just give an order saying, oh yeah, let ISIS run wild.
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  So Obama acted like he was going to go along with this
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  while the whole time trying to sabotage it.
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  That's now come out.
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  New York Times sat on it for a year.
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  WorldNet Daily has it.
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  It's now on infowars.com.
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  We can put the headline up there for everybody right now.
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  Leaked audio.
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  Obama wanted ISIS to grow.
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:01.000]  Well, hell, the CFR four years ago had the headline,
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  Why We Need Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  Their problem was we were exposing it was Al-Qaeda,
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  so they changed the name to their Islamic state.
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  So former head of psychological warfare for multiple agencies
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  and a best-selling author co-wrote books with Tom Clancy.
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  You name it.
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  Pretty Hollywood films.
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:19.000]  He's also developed a lot of great nutraceuticals.
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  He's basically done it all.
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  Another Americana Renaissance person.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  And that's Dr. Steve Pacinic, who again has really laid out,
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  I remember six years ago, he said,
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  it'll be the evolution of the states.
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  This whole globalism is going to fall apart across the world.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  It'll be dead within, you know, five, 10 years and it's happening.
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  And I tell you, he was the first I heard that was this optimistic.
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  It's happening now.
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  I mean, it's clear the title surge has happened.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  A huge fourth turning is here.
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  It's a mega turning, I believe.
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  The establishment that is mentally ill like Soros just needs to go away.
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  We don't want to have to bring all this stuff out.
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  And I'm just an average citizen here who focuses on this.
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  Like the average guy can be an expert on football or baseball
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  because that's what they're into.
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  I don't know anything about football or baseball now,
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  even though I've played football and baseball.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  I used to watch it and go to see the Cowboys play when I was a kid.
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  I don't know anything about it.
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  I know all about this.
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  And you see, the agencies know about all this
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  and the military and the police and smart people are tuned in now.
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  It doesn't matter if half the public can't find their ass with both hands.
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  I feel sorry for them.
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  The thinking public does and understands what's going on.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  So Dr. Pachinick, again, is a psychiatrist, medical doctor.
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  Harvard, MIT, whole nine yards,
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  all sorts of covert operations.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  One of the founders was General Boykin and Schumacher of Delta Force.
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  And I've got all my other big sources in the military.
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  They say, no, this guy's the real deal, rock star.
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  And he doesn't like to hear that, even know the pedigree.
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:45.000]  It's like, I was going to get Chuck Yeager on about two years ago.
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  I got contacted by one of his family.
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  He lives in Houston.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  He goes, Chuck likes your show.
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  He liked to come on.
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  And then, but he liked to come on and talk about some of these issues he's having.
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  And then his lawyer got involved and then Chuck didn't come on, which is fine.
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  Most of the audience says, who's Chuck Yeager?
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  This guy that broke the sound barrier, World War II, they saw this stuff.
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  So it's kind of crazy because I don't get excited meeting some Hollywood person.
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  They're super boring.
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  But somebody like Pachennik, who's lived all this history, or Tosh Plumlee,
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  that sat around drinking tequila and smoking cigars with Castro in 1957 when he was CIA.
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  I mean, that's cool.
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  Okay, but it's like, ah, just another old man.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  Well, this is such epic history.
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  I haven't talked to you in weeks.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  I don't even know your particular view on this.
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  I know we've got the same sources.
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  It was you over a year ago said, Alex, it's not the Russians.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  It's the WikiLeaks has gotten more.
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  Don't back off.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  It'll come out.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  You were one of my sources, but now it's confirmed they're waiting to release even more the next
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  few days.
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  If Obama and Hillary and Soros don't signal that they're going to stand down and stop
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  trying to start a war with Russia and fake hack attacks, they claimed it happened on the
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  power plant last week.
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  Even MSM exposed the Washington Post and said that was fake news.
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  So I'm now seeing a lot of MSM start going Trump's way understanding that the Trump card
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  is there, not just in name, but in reality.
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  Now, I haven't talked to you in weeks, is that accurate from your perspective, your sources,
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  and where we are the ongoing counter coup by the intelligence agencies and the American
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  people against the globalist hijacking system?
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  Yes.
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  To put it bluntly, it's quite accurate, Alex.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  As to the pedigree, let's just keep it.
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  I'm an American citizen, a veteran who really cared about our country.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  As I said before, it really started with 9-11, continued on with the Clintons, continued on
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  with Bush Jr., continued with Obama.
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  Obama came in as an affirmative action candidate created by the CIA, as I said.
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  He had no experience.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  He's had no accomplishments, and he has created absolutely nothing but a disaster around the
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:51.000]  world.
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  Those people who worked with me quietly, and those people who understood the integrity
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  of the Republic was paramount, allowed me to say, we're going to do a counter coup.
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  We were waiting for Hillary to do exactly what she did.
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  I have said from the very beginning that Hillary was not as bright as everybody thought, nor
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  were her advisors.
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  Where she fell into the trap that we said, and actually you said as well, that she's
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  not competent, that she really has no idea what she's doing, that she's physically and
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:29.000]  mentally not capable of being the President of the United States, she went after you.
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  And that's exactly what we expected would happen.
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  What was stupid was to really say that Alex Jones and the people behind it, i.e. myself
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  and others.
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  Exactly because of me.
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  We all privately talked.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  That was our goal.
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  I can't believe they took the bait, proving she shouldn't be President.
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  They did, Alex, and in the world of intelligence, quite frankly, that is pretty pathetic.
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  That's what we call a jump shot.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  It was the easiest thing in the world, but more importantly than that, the people who
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  I deal with, now remember, I do not get paid.
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  I do not represent any official organization.
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  I am simply a citizen of the United States.
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:09.000]  It's as simple as you can make it.
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  They gave me the go ahead to say, okay, we're going to dump emails that have relevance to
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  Hillary, to Comey, to the CIA, and to a whole group of individuals who will be compromised.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  And I told that before it happened.
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  The Russians were not involved in that.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  Putin has better things to do than to mess around with our election.
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  He had nothing to do with it.
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  And basically it was completely created by those of us who wanted to see the integrity
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  of the Republic reinstated.
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  And Trump would come in with a new way of dealing with the Republic and with the people
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  who were involved in a lot of chicanery.
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:59.000]  And as you see now, Trump did something no other president has done.
[1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:04.000]  He literally cleared out the Republicans who try to get rid of an ethics committee.
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  Now, Julian Assange, I do not know him.
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:08.000]  I have never met him.
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  I will tell you he is a patriot of this country.
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:20.000]  He allowed his services to be used by those people who I dealt with and who were concerned
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  as I was concerned.
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  And he was the venue when he says repeatedly that the Russians were not involved,
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:31.000]  that no Republican or Democratic party was involved.
[1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  Take his word for it.
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  Now, I could not have come on to your show weeks beforehand to say, look, Hillary and
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:42.000]  the Democrats have created a coup.
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  It is called a civilian coup.
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  We in turn, those of us who are concerned, I did not delineate any group or any individuals
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  involved, will create a counter coup.
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  How that came about was a surprise to everybody.
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:44:02.000]  And that was the leakage of all this email to you, to the country.
[1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  But remember, you are the spearhead of much of what's happened.
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:10.000]  I know you don't like to be lauded, but it is true.
[1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:17.000]  Your show and your voice was an important element to spear our discontent and our anger
[1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  through into something that was constructive.
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:25.000]  And the constructive part was to get rid of the corruption in the CIA, the corruption
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:31.000]  in the intelligence community, the corruption in the DNI, the corruption in the civilians
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:36.000]  actors and the corruption in Congress and in the candidates who were running.
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:37.000]  That happened.
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:42.000]  Now, what they're waiting for is Trump to really bring in the acts.
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  I understand.
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:45.000]  But let's talk about this point before you go there.
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  And I believe Trump's going to try to deliver.
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  They know he's moving to deliver.
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:49.000]  That's why they're so scared.
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  Fifteen and a half days.
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:53.000]  Clearly, they're going to still try to go after him after that from my sources.
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:57.000]  And I haven't talked to you about this too much, but I'd like you to give us the Hillary
[1:44:57.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  and the China connection.
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:01.000]  I know you can talk about that, or hopefully you will, that it's known.
[1:45:01.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  It got so outrageous that she was just like openly an agent of China on the phone and
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  emails, you know, with the president of China doing all this horrible stuff behind the scenes
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  that it just went too far.
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:16.000]  And then their decision to try to shut down the free press coming in this year, last year.
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:21.000]  I mean, it just the chatter got so authoritarian that people realized they had to move.
[1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  Plus the arrogance, as you said, the fact that it's known she's had the brain tumors,
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  had them removed.
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:27.000]  The Secret Service says just follow around.
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  She's fallen down all the time.
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  One month after we broke that, she fell down.
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:31.000]  They said, yeah, follow the black ambulance.
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  Well, boom.
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  Our reporters caught her falling down for over an hour or 45 minutes in, you know, in Ohio
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  a week before she fell down.
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:43.000]  They're inside of a medical tent with them running around with body armor and Secret Service.
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:47.000]  So, again, it's the insanity of King George III is what I'm seeing here.
[1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:52.000]  People had to do this, but expanding on that now, not a machinic.
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:55.000]  Just like I know before the election, they told you, it doesn't matter.
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  We're going to block this move.
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:45:57.000]  Hillary's going to win.
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:45:59.000]  They're going to steal the states.
[1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:00.000]  We probably talked about that.
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:01.000]  I said, it doesn't matter.
[1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  The tsunami is going to be so big, they're going to block that.
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:04.000]  It happened.
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  But I'm telling you now, because I know you're feeling confident, they're moving against Trump
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:09.000]  right now.
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  Their body language, their behavior, everything they do, they've broke the deal.
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:17.000]  I happen to know that the Trump people talked it to Podesta and, of course, to Obama that
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  night.
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  Trump said that when he took to the podium.
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:22.000]  There's been a lot of negotiation, a lot of things happening.
[1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  They said, look, we know you tried to steal it.
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:26.000]  You failed.
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:27.000]  Just end it now.
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:28.000]  More WikiLeaks are coming out.
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  Not that Trump's involved, but he knows from his intelligence sources, you need to stop.
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:37.000]  They blinked, but only to get time to grab sand and throw it in our eyes and come back
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:38.000]  on the attack.
[1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:39.000]  They just bought time.
[1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:41.000]  Now, everything they've done is to block Trump.
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:46.000]  The fake recounts that only gave him more votes with their shill, Jill Stein, they're
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:48.000]  going after the electors, all of it.
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:50.000]  Now they're saying the Russians are hacking power plants.
[1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  Now they're saying it ready for blackouts during the election or during the inauguration.
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:47:00.000]  I'm telling you, I smell and see not just scorched earth sabotage as Trump about to take office.
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  I see real moves and a venom now in their step in their eye that I think they're going
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:08.000]  to go for the jugular.
[1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:09.000]  You may be right.
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:10.000]  I don't disagree.
[1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  But when you're in, when one is incompetent like Hillary and those who surrounded her,
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:24.000]  well, and Soros himself, what we call in the Judenrat, the Jew who worked with the Nazis,
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:30.000]  and you made that very clear, when you have those kind of people, we're not concerned
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  because they've already been eviscerated.
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  And when I say eviscerated, I mean intellectually, emotionally, the entire DNC is non-existent.
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  They literally have no recourse to anything.
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:45.000]  They can do whatever they want.
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  At this point of time, Trump talked to Mr. Slim, who owns the New York Times.
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  What happened after that meeting?
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  What happened after that meeting?
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  The New York Times indicted and convicted this administration for having had the most
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  severe suppression of riders and leakers that has ever occurred.
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:18.000]  In other words, the New York Times themselves came up and said, Hillary, Obama, and this
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  entire group has convicted more whistleblowers, more journalists than all of the administrations
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  put together.
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  And in fact, one of the Washington Post editors who was involved in Watergate said that this
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  administration is far worse than what Nixon was.
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  What you're seeing now is a counterattack to each one of those elements, taking down the
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  New York Times, taking down the Washington Post, taking down CNN, taking down Fox.
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  Now, Meghan is going to wherever NBC, but they're not relevant.
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  The most important issue that we have brought across, and you said, is the fact that now
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  you have become the major voice of what is called the alternative media.
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  In reality, the alternative media is the media because the Internet became our tool.
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  And that's why they try the sigh-up of saying we're fake news and have the arrogance to pass
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  a law putting intelligence agencies over the FCC next year.
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  But that only means if Obama would have gotten in or Hillary would have stayed in or whatever.
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:31.000]  I mean, that's not going to work when those very agencies know what's happening.
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  No, and not only it's not going to work, Obama has no legacy.
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:42.000]  What happened is we literally stripped him of any credibility and legitimacy which he
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  never had from the beginning.
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  When he first came in, I said, this is a man who's created by the CIA, John Brennan,
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  and a bunch of morons to compensate for the fact that the agency had brought us into 9-11
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  and that they were involved.
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  In their thinking, they thought a Muslim or a mulatto individual with no background
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  and a history of homosexuality can be exceedingly vulnerable and controllable.
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  They brought him in.
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  He had no history of accomplishment, no history of having been anywhere other than with Peter
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:20.000]  Geithner in overseas and some posts.
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  The truth of the matter is he accomplished nothing.
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  The scandals that he incurred were phenomenal.
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  Sandy Hook, Osama bin Laden nonsense, Libya.
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  He created such a problem in Libya that today we cannot handle it.
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  Let me throw this in then.
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  Let me throw this in.
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  I totally agree with you.
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  As you said, we see a sudden turn at the New York Times.
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  They say the wreckage of Obama is now being swept away.
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  As soon as the Washington Post is still being loyal to Soros with Bezos,
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  attacking with fake news, MSM shooting it down now.
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  And so we can see the real break away is now happening.
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  It's very exciting.
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  Alex, again, I know you don't like to be lauded, but again, it goes to the issue that
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  you and I have talked about and have been involved for over 14 years.
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  When you see the predominant leaders of high tech companies, including Jeff Bezos,
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  sitting next to Trump, that's the kiss of death for anybody who thinks that they're
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  going to attack Trump through the Washington Post.
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  Similarly, Trump went to Slim, Carlos Slim, and that was the kiss of death for
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  anybody on the Democratic side of the left wing to think that they're going to use
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  the New York Times.
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:37.000]  So what Trump has done, he's very bright and very strategic.
[1:51:37.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  He's literally negated and obviated any ability of the mainstream media to come
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  after him with any credibility.
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  So what's happened is, thanks to your show and thanks to others, the media that's
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  becoming alternative, i.e., the New York Times, the Washington Post, they're all attacking
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  Obama.
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:52:01.000]  For the first time, I read that Obama is worse than Nixon in terms of Watergate.
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  That's right.
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  The flip started what about a week ago?
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:05.000]  Correct.
[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  It literally, that's exactly right.
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  So you can almost calculate from the pictures where Trump is sitting down with others who
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  is going to be co-opted.
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:19.000]  And in turn, Bezos was co-opted, Slim is co-opted.
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:23.000]  So we see the Washington Post run a giant false flag on Friday, saying the Russians
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  try to take down the East Coast power grid, and then within hours it's debunked by M4Wars
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:29.000]  and Drudge, and then MSM jumps on the back.
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  Normally they'd say we were lying and defend each other.
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  They're not doing it.
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:37.000]  Does that show maybe Bezos hasn't gotten the orders to his own minions at the Washington
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  Post?
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:41.000]  Because we know nobody's got more CIA people in at the Washington Post.
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  Well, they may have CIA, but again, the key element here when Trump…
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:50.000]  No, I know, but I mean leftist foundation operatives that have a CIA name.
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:53.000]  I understand, but the point is the CIA is irrelevant.
[1:52:53.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  That's why Michael Flynn has been put into the White House.
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:53:00.000]  That's why you're going to have a military man in the CIA Pompeii, and you're going
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  to have a military man in Secretary of Defense.
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  It's not for us to go to war.
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  It's simply for us to negate any of the nonsense that civilians who've never been in war,
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:13.000]  who have created war, will be neutralized.
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:17.000]  They've got a bunch of trendies trying to play at war, and they've wrecked the country
[1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  in the process.
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:19.000]  Correct.
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  Now you got it.
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:25.000]  And that's exactly what happened with Bill Clinton, what happened with Bush Jr., affirmative
[1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  action for stupidity and spoilage.
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  A guy who had no idea what he was doing attacked our own country to go to war in Iraq, which
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  was a disaster.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  Now we have a bigger disaster.
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:43.000]  Obama has no idea what to do with a half a million people that he helped to kill in Syria
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:50.000]  and one million refugees that he facilitated by his inaction and inability to think strategically
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  and tactically.
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:54.000]  This is an indictment of Obama, his White House.
[1:53:54.000 --> 1:54:01.000]  His White House is, again, a repetition of the inept and happens to be affirmative actions.
[1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:04.000]  Susan Rice, she's black.
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  You go on, I mean, when you have affirmative action, whether it's, again, for blacks or
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  whites, you mitigate the issue of competency.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  If competency-
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  You're just talking about nepotism.
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:21.000]  Well, it's not only nepotism-
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  It's like political nepotism, George W. or Loretta Lynch.
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  These are obviously idiots.
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:27.000]  Correct.
[1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  But when you have that kind of nepotism and you have that kind of discrimination saying
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  on nepotism and affirmative action and being a woman is more important than competency,
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  then you lose the credibility of the Republic.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:43.000]  And that's what I was fighting for.
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  And that's what you were fighting for.
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  And that's what our military men were fighting for.
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  Why the military?
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  Because like physicians, the military is socialized to be a profession.
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  That is, you don't make mistakes.
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  You just don't cavalierly send people into war so they can die.
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  You have a guy like James Mathis who's called Mad Dog.
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  But in fact, he's so far more intellectual than any other secretary of the fence we've
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  had, it's completely absurd.
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  When you think of dates and you think of Cohen and you think of Rumsfeld, these are morons.
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  These are guys who were pathetic individuals who worked on the issue of pandering and then
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  getting their job because they were on the opposite side or they pandered their way through.
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  Those days of pandering, those days of the politician, they're coming to an end.
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  I will make another prediction.
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  Because of the internet, we will devolve power from the federal government back to the states,
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  back to the counties, and we will start eliminating the need for senators and congressmen.
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  They have been wasting our money, wasting our time, and in fact have become an impediment to the rule of government.
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  They turned into regional czars.
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  That's correct.
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  Or as I would call it, a nursing home for those who can't work anywhere else.
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:03.000]  It's become pathetic.
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  And so no matter whether you're a Republican or Democrat, you have people like James McDermott who are hired,
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  was a psychiatrist for children and adults, a total disaster when I put them into the field.
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  A complete disaster as a psychiatrist and as a regional medical officer.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  But nevertheless, he got elected through the Boeing Corporation in the Washington state.
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  Let me ask you a quick question before you got to leave us, Dr. Steven Chenig, stevechenig.com.
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  Okay, I agree with you that I'd say it's 70-30.
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  We're doing really good right now.
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  It looks like trouble trying to deliver.
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  The economy's already turning back on.
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  But they're trying to raise rates prematurely to try to sabotage that, I think.
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  There's still a lot of problems.
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  Like the Republican establishment is just as bad as the Democratic establishment.
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  It's just as, quite frankly, daughtering, even if they're young.
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  They're just a bunch of country club, you know, people that just go to events parties and run around on red carpets all day.
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  I mean, they're the most selfish, narcissistic, materialistic, empty idiots I've ever seen.
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  And they're busy attacking Trump behind the scenes, going after him as a Russian agent,
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:11.000]  trying to block all this free market stuff because they've got all their crony deals.
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  I mean, I don't think Trump is anywhere out of the woods.
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  I mean, I agree.
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  He's got the momentum.
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  It's just a dangerous time.
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  I agree with you in many ways, Alex.
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  But what Trump understands and what Obama did before him is the fact that the executive orders are going to basically obviate the need for Congress.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  If Republicans don't come into step with Trump, they are going to lose and they will be co-opted.
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  So there's a new aggression in the country when it comes to getting our nation back.
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:48.000]  And Congress has to know this whole plan, when these bad corrupt people do stuff, they're the ones that wanted all this spy grid.
[1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:50.000]  It's going to be used against them now.
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:52.000]  And they're going to have stuff leaked on them.
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:54.000]  They're going to have Project Veritas go after them.
[1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:57.000]  We're not going to stop till we make this country great again.
[1:57:57.000 --> 1:57:58.000]  Correct.
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:05.000]  But remember, what Trump did was to bring Miss Chow, C.H.O. back in again, who is the wife of Mitch McConnell,
[1:58:05.000 --> 1:58:09.000]  which gives the warning to Mitch McConnell, clean up your actor or get out.
[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:18.000]  And basically, Trump has made it very clear you either step in line with him or you're out and you won't be involved.
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  So he's got to get rid of Paul Ryan because he's still weaseling around.
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:31.000]  Paul Ryan is nothing more than kind of a policy wonk who has nothing else to do, never created a business, never did anything.
[1:58:31.000 --> 1:58:33.000]  Okay, well do five more minutes with us if you can.
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:40.000]  Two things, our guests, I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com. We are restoring the Republic right now and we've got the highest quality
[1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:43.000]  nanotech body armor exclusively available right now.
[1:58:43.000 --> 1:59:04.000]  You need it. It funds our operation. Get it. We'll be right back.
[1:59:04.000 --> 1:59:32.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:37.000]  We are selling out of many of these items because this sale is so big and we've extended it.
[1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:42.000]  So please take advantage of this and again, thank you for fighting for the info war and supporting our operation
[1:59:42.000 --> 1:59:46.000]  and supporting not just the First Amendment, but free speech worldwide.
[1:59:46.000 --> 2:00:08.000]  That's infowarsstore.com or the right of the supplements at infowarslive.com.
[2:00:08.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:41.000]  I only bring this up not about infowars, but so people understand the model of victory if anything even happens to us.
[2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  It's a very satisfied feeling to see people that are smarter than I am, better than I am with their own media outlets that are just exploding all over the place.
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  But to see our view, our historical research, our perspective, our wide spectrum of guests to really try to get at the truth.
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  We're not trying to live in some delusional land where we make up what we want and then go out like a bunch of mentally ill peacocks.
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:02.000]  I think it's perfect that Megyn Kelly's going over there.
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  I mean, she became ugly physically when she sold out, literally.
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  She came like the witch, you know, from Snow White and then now her ratings plunge.
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:13.000]  They were trying to prop him up and she's just gone.
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:17.000]  She in New York believed that she could be on NBC or CNN.
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:20.000]  That was what was a proper, that's what the president likes.
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  That's what the other women where she gets her hair done or into.
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  I mean, it's just, okay, they're really smart, great women.
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:28.000]  You can put in positions. This is not one of them.
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  She's a dingbat.
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  And so Info Wars success has been in that we just basically have hammered the truth, not some other narrative we were given.
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  And it wasn't some delusional narrative that we just came up with.
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  And so that's really been the strength of the broadcast is because I was never even trying to talk to intelligence communities, the military police.
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  In fact, when I was bashing them and attacking them saying, what's wrong with you?
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  Why are you doing this? Why don't you fight for America?
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  Why don't you stand up? Well, you notice they started doing it.
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  It's because the public wasn't supporting them.
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:05.000]  It's kind of like in FIFA Vendetta. He says, why did you come forward earlier?
[2:02:05.000 --> 2:02:07.000]  Because I was waiting for you, Inspector. I was waiting for you.
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:11.000]  That's emblematic of the men doing something that's now happening.
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  And I was just an earlier wave of people concerned about this desperately trying to reach people,
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  never intending to be the big swing. And you know what?
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  And I don't want to be that. I want to see prosperity.
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:23.000]  I want to be able to back off and not be so desperate.
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  Dr. CP Chenick, in the three minutes we've got left, I want to thank you.
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  I want to congratulate you. We should celebrate, Trump.
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:31.000]  We should celebrate that America is coming back in.
[2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:34.000]  I think we should thank everybody, the listeners, the viewers, the patriots.
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:39.000]  They're all just as important as any of us, like any part of an electrical line over a thousand miles.
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:41.000]  They're the connection. They're the heart, they're the blood.
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  So I want to salute them as well. Who else do you want to thank out there?
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  Well, I want to thank you. You've been very modest about your capability.
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:55.000]  But the reality is, in my world, when I try to access the radio right after 9-11,
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  there was only one man who came forth and had the courage.
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:02.000]  And it's a simple word called courage, and that was Alex Jones.
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  And it was your audience. Your audience has been phenomenal.
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:07.000]  They're all over the world.
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:10.000]  I get responses from Australia, England, everywhere.
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  These are wonderful people.
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  But remember, a moment of courage can take down so many administrations
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:23.000]  and so many problems that you can underestimate what you have done.
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  Now, I don't want to call it victory because there is no victory of us.
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:29.000]  It's a continuum. It's a continuum.
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:31.000]  It's a continuum. That's correct, Alice.
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:37.000]  It's a continuum of our continuing to struggle to clear out what's a mess
[2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  and to use the latest tools that you use, that Trump had used,
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:45.000]  and that the Americans understand social media.
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  Now we're going to be in a bigger world.
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  We are affecting now Brexit, which I told you you would expect.
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:55.000]  You know what? I wanted to get you on next week for a full hour to break this down.
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:03:56.000]  If you've got to go, fine.
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  No, I can go. I'll come back.
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:01.000]  Let me come back for like five minutes and then let you get into strategy
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  for the next phase, what we expect to see.
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:07.000]  It's not some game plan you are being given by some shadowy agency.
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  The return of Americana, the return of Renaissance,
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  you know, as a real battlefield expert that has overthrown a lot of countries
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  that were tyrannical and helped keep countries that were good in place.
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:18.000]  I mean, you've done a lot of stuff.
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:22.000]  You and I overthrew a domestic country and that was the Clintons.
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:24.000]  You were part of it.
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  Absolutely. So I want you to, as a real expert from the ground right up at the top,
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:31.000]  what you expect to see, the good, the bad, the ugly,
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  I'm going to just let you host it when we come back.
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  And then I'm going to take over with the latest news and developments.
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:43.000]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com and it's a war.
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  It's ongoing, but you're seeing we're winning major battles
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  and the tide's turning very quickly.
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  Does that mean there's some utopia over the next hill?
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  No, we're still going to be fallible humans,
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:56.000]  but it means we're going to have people in place that aren't a bunch of pedophiles, basically.
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:04:57.000]  I mean, just look at Hillary and Bill Clinton.
[2:04:57.000 --> 2:05:00.000]  These are freaking demons, man.
[2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:02.000]  Let's take a look at some of the headlines.
[2:05:30.000 --> 2:05:49.000]  He just says, well, I'm going to negotiate a better deal.
[2:05:49.000 --> 2:05:52.000]  Well, how exactly are you going to negotiate that?
[2:05:52.000 --> 2:05:54.000]  What magic wand do you have?
[2:05:54.000 --> 2:05:56.000]  And usually the answer is you don't have an answer.
[2:05:56.000 --> 2:06:00.000]  This is Owen Shroyer from Magic Wandland.
[2:06:26.000 --> 2:06:51.000]  I'm going to take over with the latest news and developments.
[2:06:51.000 --> 2:07:17.000]  I'm going to take over with the latest news and developments.
[2:07:17.000 --> 2:07:46.000]  I'm going to take over with the latest news and developments.
[2:07:46.000 --> 2:08:12.000]  I'm going to take over with the latest news and developments.
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:41.000]  He never gives up. He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas worldwide.
[2:08:41.000 --> 2:08:48.000]  Well, the New World Order, the globalists, and their little plan to have a monopoly system worldwide didn't go in too well.
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:51.000]  There's people like Prosperity and Innovation.
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:09:01.000]  They don't want to be lectured by a bunch of weird socialist mental patients that want to attack civilization because they're in competition with it.
[2:09:01.000 --> 2:09:13.000]  All right, Dr. Steve Pacinac, I wanted to get you on next week. Let's do it, too, to spend an hour on really how you see the history of the world so far, this de-evolution of power to the people, to the states, to the local.
[2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:15.000]  You know, small is beautiful.
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  And then expanding into the current threats you see and what you do expect, some of the forces of monopoly and corruption to try to pull here in the next 16 days and then after.
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:44.000]  I think what Trump has to do now is to make sure that the people he puts in place in all the institutions, all of them are really vetted out pretty well.
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:46.000]  Now, what do I mean by that?
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:58.000]  For many of us on the Alex Jones show and the Truth of Movement, we can't have a reappearance of those who are neocons or neoconservatives.
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  In particular, John Bolton, Elliot Abrams, Wolfowitz, Pearl, David Worms, there are a whole bunch of these people who are sycophants and basically gathering around Washington and Trump and basically explaining how they really didn't do anything bad for the country and they served it and they're essential to the running of our government.
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:25.000]  That's not true.
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:34.000]  He needs to clear out the entire neocon area with what Mike Flynn understands and James Mathis understands.
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:38.000]  And he has to clear it out because they're dangerous to our republic.
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  These are the same people who were never held accountable for 9-11 or stand down.
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:44.000]  That's the first thing.
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:11:09.000]  The second thing James Mathis, General Mathis, has to really take in stride the idol whom he wants to follow and that's my idol as well, General George Marshall, who basically, when he came in to World War II, cleared out three to 400 generals and admirals because he needed a new staff.
[2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:30.000]  He needed a staff where a 59-year-old Lieutenant Colonel, Lieutenant Colonel by the name of Dwight D. Eisenhower came in to be the head of Eurocom and the commanding forces of the World War II, he had an uncanny understanding of who were the talented people.
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  The same case, James Mathis has to clear out the Pentagon.
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:40.000]  We have a one-to-one, teeth-to-tail ratio, which is not acceptable.
[2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:44.000]  What that means is that we have one bureaucrat for one fighter.
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:47.000]  That's unheard of in the history of American warfare.
[2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  We need a teeth-to-tail ratio of about 15 to 20 to one.
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:12:04.000]  In other words, get rid of the half a million or three-quarters of a million of the bureaucrats and promote the young lieutenants and captains into positions of power and command and control.
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  Secondly, the issue of ISIS and Al Qaeda has to be resolved very quickly.
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:11.000]  That's not on the battlefield.
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:12.000]  It's back at home.
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:23.000]  Those who created it, namely CIA and others who consorted with them and the civilians who were involved, have to be held accountable.
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:26.000]  This is not an enemy that came out of nowhere.
[2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  This is an enemy created by our own CIA, by our own intelligence community, and by our own mercenaries.
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:38.000]  If we do not clear it out, it will be an indictment again of the American Republic.
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:41.000]  It's not an issue of bombing these people out.
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:45.000]  You can't bomb terrorists down, but you can create them.
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:47.000]  John Kerry is responsible.
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:49.000]  Hillary Clinton is responsible.
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:50.000]  Obama is responsible.
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:52.000]  Brandon is responsible.
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:54.000]  And the list goes on and on.
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:13:02.000]  If we hold no one accountable, we will again repeat the mistrials and misgivings of the Clinton administration.
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:15.000]  And Bush Jr., we have to have a war trials committee that has to be instilled very much the way we did after apartheid.
[2:13:15.000 --> 2:13:25.000]  That war trials committee has to have a reconciliation element to it, but it has to bring forth all those people who were involved in 9-11.
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:29.000]  Bush, Cheney, Romsfeld, Condoleezza Rice.
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:39.000]  Once we have that in front of the American public and the world, the Muslims of the world will see that we treat everybody with equal justice.
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  But as long as we keep putting on Jewish ambassadors to Israel, it's not going to work.
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:54.000]  It's not an accident that the only time we have been successful with Israel and a Muslim country was under Jimmy Carter.
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  Number one, he was not Jewish. Number two, he was a very bright man who had a willingness to risk his political capital to put together Camp David.
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  Number three, or number two, is the fact that we had Stanfield Turner, who's director of the CIA, a military man who was number one in Annapolis.
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:21.000]  Together, we were able to put together a treaty that lasted, for God knows how long, 40, 50 years.
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  With John Kerry, we had an individual who's a CIA spelling bones idiot, literally a man who's not very bright, who never was bright.
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:36.000]  I said you'd host, but I've got to ask this question. He looks like he's neurologically degrading by the month.
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  He flicks his tongue every two seconds and seems to be having a mental breakdown.
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:44.000]  I mean, medically, you are a psychiatrist. I'm in an MD. Can you comment on that?
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:58.000]  Well, I can't say very much about his tongue movements. I can tell you a lot about his narcissism, where we picked it up in the Nixon and the subsequent administrations when he went to Vietnam and brought with him a film crew.
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:03.000]  And that was totally out of, you know, we couldn't believe what he had done.
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  Have you seen the photo of him looking down the barrel of a gun?
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:06.000]  No.
[2:15:06.000 --> 2:15:08.000]  I mean, you can't make it up. I'm sorry. I'll keep going.
[2:15:08.000 --> 2:15:15.000]  I'm sorry. That's all right, Alice. You can intervene. Basically, he is a pathetic, dumb individual.
[2:15:15.000 --> 2:15:20.000]  He was a Jew whose father was a Jew created some kind of name Kerry from Ireland.
[2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:30.000]  But he is typical of the politicians who spent most of their years at our taxpayer dollars to hustle and to get into a position of Secretary of State.
[2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:42.000]  As Secretary of State, he really has accomplished very little. The Iran Treaty was something that we wanted in the military only because we needed to offset it to Saudi Arabia.
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:56.000]  The treaty itself and the provisions have to be reexamined. And of course, the amount of money that was spent for the hostages in the billions of dollars was incredible and has to be held accountable.
[2:15:56.000 --> 2:16:06.000]  So we need to go back to all the administrations and basically have an open hearing kind of what we had in South Africa.
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:22.000]  What went wrong? How did it go wrong? And this is true of Obama. This is true of Bush Jr. If we do that, then we can proceed as a country as the leading superpower, which we are and we can continue to be.
[2:16:22.000 --> 2:16:27.000]  But you say we lose the soft power and we don't admit all the corruption and all the bizarreness that's going on.
[2:16:27.000 --> 2:16:33.000]  Well, that's not soft power in my world. Corruption is far more lethal than any gun.
[2:16:33.000 --> 2:16:40.000]  Well, sure, it takes you over. It allows you to be able to try it. In fact, let me ask this question. You've told me privately. I don't get what you told me, but other people said the same thing over the years.
[2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:49.000]  And I followed it myself. It's very clear, you know, the Communist generals, the Chinese generals, you know, out of uniform meeting with Clinton over and over again, you know, back in the 90s.
[2:16:49.000 --> 2:16:57.000]  I mean, out of all the people that pay off Hillary, I know she's an agent of herself, but there comes a time when you actually are really serving one master like Bob Dylan says.
[2:16:57.000 --> 2:17:01.000]  And I mean, is she not pretty much a Communist Chinese agent?
[2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:13.000]  I don't know if she's an agent. I don't think she's that she's not. She's basically so self centered that she will take money from anybody and anywhere and will accommodate.
[2:17:13.000 --> 2:17:25.000]  Sure. What does it say as a psychiatrist if somebody steals furniture everywhere they go? Basically, you know, this is a woman who has many, many psychological problems, including the fact that her father wasn't there.
[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:42.000]  I don't want to get into her history, but her history is pretty evident to everybody now in terms of eclectocracy, the ability to steal, the ability to create collusion, the ability to co-op and the ability, inability to really think through a problem or think through a strategy,
[2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:53.000]  which would suit the nation, not herself. And her self referential ideas cost her downfall, as well as Bill Clinton, who helped to take her down.
[2:17:53.000 --> 2:18:03.000]  I mean, probably the most damning evidence that occurred, and I said it repeatedly, and I warned them that Bill Clinton would undermine her campaign.
[2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:11.000]  And how did he do it? He walked over to Loretta Lynch's plane and spent 15 to 20 minutes, 20 minutes there.
[2:18:11.000 --> 2:18:14.000]  And she now says she regrets that. Yeah, that was illegal.
[2:18:14.000 --> 2:18:24.000]  Of course it's illegal, but that was Bill Clinton at his finest. He couldn't give a damn about his wife. He doesn't give a damn about the country.
[2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:30.000]  That was Bill Clinton. And I predicted that he would do something that would undermine her campaign.
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:31.000]  You did?
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:33.000]  He couldn't help it.
[2:18:33.000 --> 2:18:41.000]  By the way, you saw when he was in Israel at one of the funerals, and Obama for like 20 minutes, like, get up, Bill, get up. And I was watching Bill with a crowd.
[2:18:41.000 --> 2:18:44.000]  He looked like he was completely out of his mind.
[2:18:44.000 --> 2:18:54.000]  Well, you know, Bill is his own creation. Bill is not a man of achievement. Bill is not a man of real accomplishment.
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:19:13.000]  He's basically a smooth talking bullshitter from Arkansas. And he was put there by Sam Walton, who had been in the intelligence community, was in charge of all of the repatriation of the Italians and Irish into camps that we had in the United States.
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:16.000]  The point is that she is...
[2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:25.000]  By the way, I got to skip this network break and give me a few more minutes. I knew that. But I think you're getting into stuff that people don't even know at this point. Why don't you tell people about Walmart?
[2:19:25.000 --> 2:19:28.000]  I mean, since you're getting into these areas in Arkansas and the weird...
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:35.000]  Walmart is a fancy outlet of a Chinese expansion or basically Chinese expansion.
[2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:39.000]  That's right. The deal made in the 70s, and now we see what it's done.
[2:19:39.000 --> 2:19:48.000]  Correct. And you have to remember, Sam Walton wasn't the sweet, innocent American. He was a very sophisticated intelligence operative.
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:58.000]  I believe he was a captain at the time during World War II, where he was in charge of the incarceration of Italians and other aliens, supposedly, but not the Japanese.
[2:19:58.000 --> 2:20:09.000]  And he remained in power and eventually built it up through corruption, through Chinese negotiation, and through the banks that he owned.
[2:20:09.000 --> 2:20:20.000]  I mean, it wasn't only Hillary that was compromised. We had, in the late 80s, we had evidence that Bill Clinton was compromised by the Chinese. Al Gore had received money.
[2:20:20.000 --> 2:20:21.000]  Hillary had received money.
[2:20:21.000 --> 2:20:23.000]  Sure. They didn't get the missile secrets.
[2:20:23.000 --> 2:20:29.000]  Well, that was... Why give North Korea the reactors that could create A-bombs again?
[2:20:29.000 --> 2:20:41.000]  Because what they wanted to do was to create strategic tension against which we, the Americans, would have to confront and basically fund the military industrial complex.
[2:20:41.000 --> 2:20:49.000]  It's an antiquated concept. It's a concept that came in with Kissinger, with a whole bunch of other people, but we don't need strategic...
[2:20:49.000 --> 2:20:56.000]  Yeah, and now we've given them too much strategic power doing that to Korea. We're much stronger against China, who's already making belligerent moves.
[2:20:56.000 --> 2:21:00.000]  It just shows how they claim it's the strategic tension. They're really just selling us out.
[2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:07.000]  Well, let me be frank. China is sitting on a very dangerous precipice.
[2:21:07.000 --> 2:21:14.000]  I know they are, and I'm sick of their arrogance. Why do you think they're blowing up and getting on our face now after Obama's been over to them?
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:19.000]  Because that's their response. What they have is called the Middle Kingdom complex.
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:25.000]  You either come to China as a supplicant, but you do not come to China as a master.
[2:21:25.000 --> 2:21:31.000]  We've come to China repeatedly and said to them, this is what we want, and this is what we want you to do.
[2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:39.000]  The Chinese, in turn, react to that. Their problem is massive corruption, massive fiscal instability.
[2:21:39.000 --> 2:21:44.000]  There is a huge drainage of cash going out of China.
[2:21:44.000 --> 2:21:45.000]  And brain drain.
[2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:46.000]  I'm sorry?
[2:21:46.000 --> 2:21:50.000]  It's just like going out to East Texas or places where all the really smart people have left.
[2:21:50.000 --> 2:21:52.000]  There's still some people, but you know what I mean? It's a brain drain.
[2:21:52.000 --> 2:21:58.000]  Correct. It's not only a brain drain, but also the fact there is no more dollars there.
[2:21:58.000 --> 2:22:07.000]  They're losing their reserves at a very high rate, and they can't rely on 3 trillion or 3 billion or whatever it is they have.
[2:22:07.000 --> 2:22:11.000]  And that's why the big banks are now having to admit Trump's right. We can tell China to whatever we want.
[2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:14.000]  And quite frankly, some of Trump's policies will be better for China long run.
[2:22:14.000 --> 2:22:17.000]  They have to reform and stop centralizing control.
[2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:22.000]  Correct. I mean, but what Trump said repeatedly is, look, and he was right on the nose.
[2:22:22.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  I think that was Mike Flynn and others who agreed. I agreed with it when he said, North Korea is China's problem.
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:34.000]  If you can't handle North Korea, don't even come to us. That's your creation. It's your problem.
[2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:38.000]  Exactly. Stop using this little moron. We know it's you.
[2:22:38.000 --> 2:22:45.000]  Right. And the fact is this young man, or he's not a young man, Kim Jong-un was trained in Switzerland,
[2:22:45.000 --> 2:22:51.000]  went to boarding school, speaks English very well, speaks French, speaks a lot of languages.
[2:22:51.000 --> 2:22:59.000]  He loves basketball, and he has played out a lot of operatives into Canada, into Europe,
[2:22:59.000 --> 2:23:04.000]  who are now wanting to change the course of North Korea, but it's not sufficient.
[2:23:04.000 --> 2:23:07.000]  And in fact, if he continues...
[2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:11.000]  Yeah, let's talk about North Korea, because you're somebody, I mean, can I tell people?
[2:23:11.000 --> 2:23:13.000]  You're able to go into North Korea. You know these people.
[2:23:13.000 --> 2:23:19.000]  Right. Well, I know them to the extent that I've been tracking them for about 20, 30 years.
[2:23:19.000 --> 2:23:23.000]  Well, they let you in and out of the country, and you go talk to them, or you tell us about that?
[2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:30.000]  Well, no. Basically, let me get into this. Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-un, his grandfather was...
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:35.000]  Kim Jong-un's grandfather was a very important man because he turned around North Korea
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:38.000]  and made it more prosperous than South Korea.
[2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:48.000]  Once he left, then his son and Kim Jong-un's father really went the root of a deviation from what Kim Il-sung was.
[2:23:48.000 --> 2:23:53.000]  And he was somebody who fought the Japanese. He was somebody who was truly a freedom fighter.
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:24:02.000]  Then we had the corruption come in with nepotism and eventually the degradation of a financial basis in North Korea,
[2:24:02.000 --> 2:24:09.000]  which was then co-opted by the South Koreans and other countries that went in and used the cheap labor.
[2:24:09.000 --> 2:24:15.000]  Now, Kim Jong-un, one of his major leverage points, is still using nuclear weapons.
[2:24:15.000 --> 2:24:21.000]  That's not going to work. I mean, in fact, he's far from delivering a nuclear warhead on a missile,
[2:24:21.000 --> 2:24:24.000]  contrary to what most people have said.
[2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:30.000]  And in fact, what he does want is recognition to be part of a legitimate nation state.
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:36.000]  He will not get it if his only modus operandi is to use the missile systems.
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:48.000]  He will get it if he stands down and allows the Chinese and other countries to come in and start to turn around the North Korean budget.
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:54.000]  The real fear of North Korea and China is that we will meld them together.
[2:24:54.000 --> 2:25:01.000]  In other words, what happened when we were involved in the amalgamation of East Germany and West Germany,
[2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:11.000]  we never took in consideration the East German lack of financial integrity or the great debts that East Germany had.
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:19.000]  And when they came together, East and West Germany, we realized that there was a huge financial drain on the Germans.
[2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:24.000]  In North Korea, this is even a bigger problem if they are to collapse.
[2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:26.000]  And we can collapse the system very quickly.
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:32.000]  China knows there will be thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of North Koreans streaming.
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:35.000]  Sure. And Russia, that's a Russia crisis because they border as well.
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:39.000]  Then why is China acting so belligerent? Is that all just a confidence act?
[2:25:39.000 --> 2:25:48.000]  Well, it's basically their modus operandi, but also at the same time they're trying to reassert it at a time at which we have political transition
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  that they want us to act in a way that's deferential to the Chinese and not deferential to Taiwan.
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:57.000]  And Trump did the right thing.
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:26:08.000]  He basically made a call to Taiwan and said, look, you can become the leverage point in a 30-year negotiation which really hasn't gone very far.
[2:26:08.000 --> 2:26:11.000]  The Chinese need us more than we need China.
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:15.000]  Their exports are nice, they're cheap, and you can go to Walmart.
[2:26:15.000 --> 2:26:18.000]  But their legitimacy is a real problem.
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:20.000]  There are two elements to their problem.
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:22.000]  One is water. They have no water.
[2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:29.000]  Half a billion Chinese north of the Yalu and the Yangtze River have absolutely no water.
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:30.000]  And of course energy.
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:31.000]  Energy.
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  But I predict if there's going to be a war, that war will be between China and India over the Himalayas.
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:39.000]  Absolutely.
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:42.000]  The second element is what we talked about.
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:45.000]  There is no financial integrity to China.
[2:26:45.000 --> 2:26:52.000]  In fact, China cannot give you a number that's valid or in any way legitimate.
[2:26:52.000 --> 2:26:57.000]  If they were to tell me their growth rate is 6% to 8%, I would say I don't believe it.
[2:26:57.000 --> 2:26:59.000]  Because they're well known.
[2:26:59.000 --> 2:27:00.000]  It's all state-run.
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:08.000]  They execute you if you criticize the stock, guling at fake news, the penalties death, and are crazy elite are trying to adopt the Chinese censorship model here in America.
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:11.000]  So there's obviously some real hurdles ahead, but I agree.
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:15.000]  I think we've got the initiative overall.
[2:27:15.000 --> 2:27:18.000]  Shifting back to the Democratic Party, they do seem delusional.
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:20.000]  Pelosi now seems to be the leader.
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:21.000]  She says they did everything fine.
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:22.000]  Everything's wonderful.
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:24.000]  They're going to go ahead with their culture war map.
[2:27:24.000 --> 2:27:26.000]  But we know they stole five states from Trump.
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:31.000]  We know there were actually way bigger numbers of Hispanics and blacks that voted for him, but still record numbers did.
[2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:36.000]  So they seem to be fundamentally still delusional at the top surrounded by yes men.
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:42.000]  I see that as very positive if it doesn't go too far and they start a war in the process of their delusion.
[2:27:42.000 --> 2:27:45.000]  But if they just stay kind of delusional and keep falling apart, that's great.
[2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:56.000]  My only concern is take over the Republican Party fully, purge it of all the globalists, and then move forward with absolute technology advancements to pull the world out of the carrying capacity problem we have.
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:28:02.000]  Because the globalists decided, let everybody starve to death, don't build the new systems, have a global collapse, use that as a consolidation model.
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:06.000]  Well, that model will probably kill everybody in huge wars.
[2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:08.000]  No, we have to stabilize the third world.
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:10.000]  We have to release the advanced technologies.
[2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:12.000]  We've got to build the space colonies.
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:15.000]  We've got to put in the undersea, you know, extraction systems.
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:18.000]  We've got to go next level or we're gone.
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:23.000]  Well, the problem with the DNC is the problem of ageism.
[2:28:23.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  You have three of the major leaders are on their mate in their 70s and they don't want to give up power.
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  Nancy Pelosi has never had a legitimate contestant against her for the past 30 to 40 years.
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:38.000]  She comes out of a safe zone in San Francisco.
[2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:41.000]  Steny Hoyer out of Maryland is another problem.
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:44.000]  Ben Cardin out of Maryland is another problem.
[2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:48.000]  So the problem really resides within the Democratic Party.
[2:28:48.000 --> 2:28:51.000]  Either they clean it out or they are really reinvigorated.
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:53.000]  They say they're not going to.
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:28:55.000]  They say they're doing a great job.
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:29:01.000]  Well, that's delusional. That's exactly what happens when you think that you're that important, which she is not.
[2:29:01.000 --> 2:29:05.000]  Neither of the three of them that important, but there is no contest.
[2:29:05.000 --> 2:29:08.000]  And for the most part, they've alienated their constituents.
[2:29:08.000 --> 2:29:10.000]  So there's really no more Democratic Party.
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:18.000]  As far as we're concerned, the final coup for us and counter coup was to get rid of the Democratic Party and make them impotent.
[2:29:18.000 --> 2:29:23.000]  And if they push too far, a lot more is going to come out that is very damaging for the country.
[2:29:23.000 --> 2:29:25.000]  But if we have to cut the cancer out, we will.
[2:29:25.000 --> 2:29:26.000]  And that's the warning.
[2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:27.000]  They're being given.
[2:29:27.000 --> 2:29:30.000]  Dr. Pachennick, StevePachennick.com, your books, all your materials there.
[2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:31.000]  People can also follow you on Twitter.
[2:29:31.000 --> 2:29:32.000]  Thanks for the time.
[2:29:32.000 --> 2:29:35.000]  And it's great to have you here with us in 2017.
[2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:37.000]  And happy new year.
[2:29:37.000 --> 2:29:38.000]  You and your audience.
[2:29:38.000 --> 2:29:40.000]  We are coming out of the storm, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:29:40.000 --> 2:29:41.000]  There are more on the horizon.
[2:29:41.000 --> 2:29:43.000]  We've made it through this one.
[2:29:43.000 --> 2:29:48.000]  All right, we'll be back with other big breaking news and more straight ahead on Alex Jones.
[2:29:48.000 --> 2:29:51.000]  We're on the march.
[2:29:51.000 --> 2:29:53.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:53.000 --> 2:30:19.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:23.000 --> 2:30:24.000]  The US government is making an election.
[2:30:24.000 --> 2:30:27.000]  Assange makes the keen observation that in the statement made by five different branches
[2:30:27.000 --> 2:30:30.000]  of the US government against the 35 Russian diplomats that were removed from the US,
[2:30:30.000 --> 2:30:33.000]  WikiLeaks was not referenced once.
[2:30:33.000 --> 2:30:37.000]  Back on November 9, Obama assured President-elect Trump and the American people that he would do
[2:30:37.000 --> 2:30:39.000]  everything possible to make this a smooth transition.
[2:30:39.000 --> 2:30:41.000]  Someone is lying.
[2:30:41.000 --> 2:30:46.000]  So I want to be honest, it's not as if it's just Republicans who have monkeed around with
[2:30:46.000 --> 2:30:47.000]  elections of the past.
[2:30:47.000 --> 2:30:49.000]  Sometimes Democrats have to.
[2:30:49.000 --> 2:30:51.000]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[2:30:51.000 --> 2:30:55.820]  What does that mean this is all destroyer for info wars, and there's a war on for your mind
[2:31:00.500 --> 2:31:05.720]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money

[2:33:17.640 --> 2:33:21.040]  You are either with the Republic or against it
[2:33:21.040 --> 2:33:27.800]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[2:33:51.040 --> 2:34:07.040]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us. We're gonna be talking to a guest here in a few minutes
[2:34:07.040 --> 2:34:11.920]  But I want to get our crew with some earpieces. So we're gonna do that here in just a second. There are so many
[2:34:12.400 --> 2:34:15.640]  So many things to cover today. Obviously, we're living in the twilight zone
[2:34:15.640 --> 2:34:22.840]  I mean, we're defeating the globalists that hijacked the country. They're in total panic wiki leaks from US intelligence agencies are ready to destroy
[2:34:23.320 --> 2:34:27.880]  Obama the Democrats and everybody else Bezos the New York Times are rolling over in fear
[2:34:28.360 --> 2:34:32.720]  And Trump is holding back releasing information. It'll just destroy all of them did not come
[2:34:33.480 --> 2:34:35.480]  From the Russians. Let me assure you
[2:34:37.280 --> 2:34:39.680]  So it's a very exciting time to be alive
[2:34:39.680 --> 2:34:43.000]  I want to play some of these clips though because they're important and I haven't gotten to it
[2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:48.320]  One of them is Washington Post editor Trump reading info wars can tank markets invite
[2:34:49.160 --> 2:34:52.360]  Incursions, this is the same Washington Post that ran a hoax last week
[2:34:52.880 --> 2:34:57.200]  Saying that the Russians had hacked the Vermont power grid to shut off the East Coast just totally made up
[2:34:57.200 --> 2:35:00.200]  They had to retract two days later after we broke it and drudge carried it
[2:35:00.600 --> 2:35:05.440]  Now everybody's turning against admitting it and then Spicer says Trump will absolutely use Twitter as POTUS
[2:35:05.440 --> 2:35:09.080]  Yeah, bypassing the media meet the spokesman the president, you know
[2:35:09.080 --> 2:35:12.560]  The president's usually just come out and talk to the public give an address or talk to the media
[2:35:12.800 --> 2:35:15.040]  That you didn't sit there and like have their minions do it
[2:35:15.040 --> 2:35:19.420]  It's all these minions that want to control things so that is very important and then a third clip that goes with it
[2:35:19.920 --> 2:35:25.640]  Is CNN aired fake video of a video game B roll from Fallout 4?
[2:35:26.960 --> 2:35:29.320]  fake video from Fallout 4 of
[2:35:30.480 --> 2:35:37.960]  Hackers of Russian hackers hacking so that's how dumb they think you are is they use CG fake video of a fake hacker
[2:35:37.960 --> 2:35:43.680]  From a fake video game, and then they think you're so stupid. This is like I don't know what happened at Sandy Hook
[2:35:44.000 --> 2:35:46.480]  There are real shootings. I bet kids did down very sad
[2:35:46.480 --> 2:35:52.080]  The point is is that you got answer Cooper turning and it's a green screen you answer Cooper turning and his nose
[2:35:52.920 --> 2:35:57.000]  Disappears and then you've got Nancy Grace when she was still at CNN with the other reporter
[2:35:57.000 --> 2:36:00.920]  They're talking in a cul-de-sac the same cars are driving around in circles
[2:36:01.880 --> 2:36:07.400]  Behind them so you see the same cars and they got caught. I mean, I don't know what they're up to these people are liars
[2:36:07.400 --> 2:36:09.400]  Okay, and I can see what they're doing
[2:36:09.880 --> 2:36:15.240]  So we've got all these clips here showing how they're the fake news how they're a joke how they're a fraud and a
[2:36:15.680 --> 2:36:18.760]  Lot of people now realize Trump's gonna get in they're not gonna be able to stop it
[2:36:18.760 --> 2:36:23.360]  But Soros is crazy and he may have that dead man switch is one of our guests was saying yesterday
[2:36:24.040 --> 2:36:29.560]  And it's it's just a time to be praying a time to be focused a time to be very very watchful
[2:36:29.560 --> 2:36:34.120]  So let's go through a few of these clips. This is a wash and post editor attacking yours truly
[2:36:34.120 --> 2:36:38.760]  They're the ones trying to take markets the market Trump has it up of a
[2:36:39.600 --> 2:36:45.720]  Trillion 200 billion dollars a hundred billion plus of investment coming back in it's all over the news that incredible things are happening
[2:36:46.320 --> 2:36:52.200]  consumer conferences the highest ever recorded by Gallup in over a hundred years and
[2:36:54.000 --> 2:36:55.920]  We're being told see it's our fault
[2:36:55.920 --> 2:36:57.600]  Well, they see they're trying to crash the economy
[2:36:57.600 --> 2:37:02.680]  They're trying to crash the power grid and they want to blend the Russians and info wars because you know, we're all risky spies around here folks
[2:37:02.680 --> 2:37:07.680]  Oh, yeah, we're real risky spies around here. So let's go ahead and go to those clips. He's playing an order
[2:37:07.680 --> 2:37:09.680]  Here's the here's the editor of the wash and post
[2:37:09.920 --> 2:37:12.960]  And the problem is not just a chaotic management theory
[2:37:12.960 --> 2:37:17.480]  It's actually a weird cycle by which he will stay on message for seven days
[2:37:17.480 --> 2:37:22.480]  And then all of a sudden three in the morning he reads info wars and you know
[2:37:22.480 --> 2:37:28.040]  It sends off a tweet and goes off and then everyone has to go to the family and say can you get him back on the wagon?
[2:37:28.040 --> 2:37:34.600]  And then there's another part crisis like you know process like this the presidency can't work that way
[2:37:34.600 --> 2:37:40.960]  You can tank markets. You can invite incursions. You know a variety of hit pause back this up
[2:37:40.960 --> 2:37:43.760]  This is gone national television facelination
[2:37:44.320 --> 2:37:48.040]  Attacking us and their viewership so low now only like three or four million. We don't even care about it
[2:37:48.040 --> 2:37:50.040]  We don't even know about it till it showed me yesterday
[2:37:50.560 --> 2:37:52.440]  Let's explain something here
[2:37:52.440 --> 2:37:56.960]  They keep saying it's like Trump thinks he can make decisions himself. He can't do that
[2:37:56.960 --> 2:38:01.680]  He's not infallible. You certainly aren't chicken neck either. You just keep thinking like he's crazy
[2:38:01.760 --> 2:38:06.400]  He could make the wrong decision and tank things. You're the ones trying to take things jerk
[2:38:07.000 --> 2:38:12.640]  You're the person that's ever done anything in their life. Just running around tell us what we should do caught running fake news. I
[2:38:14.080 --> 2:38:16.640]  Mean what you're because you have a pinhead you're like a chicken neck
[2:38:16.640 --> 2:38:19.560]  It's like revenge of the wimps. I'm not against wimps and nerds
[2:38:19.560 --> 2:38:24.640]  It's like all the criminals attacking is like these wimps that have something to prove because their weewees are half inch long
[2:38:24.640 --> 2:38:28.600]  I mean, I'm serious folks. That's Quentin's theory on and I think it's really true more more
[2:38:28.600 --> 2:38:29.880]  I realize it's a bunch of jerks
[2:38:29.880 --> 2:38:35.480]  The thing I can just push us around all day and they take our kindness as weakness. They're learning. That's not the case
[2:38:35.800 --> 2:38:38.360]  And I'm not trying to just they don't even listen to warnings
[2:38:38.360 --> 2:38:40.560]  So just you know what go ahead and try to keep Trump out
[2:38:40.560 --> 2:38:47.360]  We're going to destroy all of you with information warfare with all the stuff you've done all of you get ready to wreck your lives
[2:38:47.560 --> 2:38:49.560]  Because you weren't led into this corrupt system
[2:38:49.880 --> 2:38:51.680]  For nothing you're all a bunch of scum
[2:38:51.680 --> 2:38:56.320]  We know that so everything's coming out on all of you go ahead and fill your hand dumbasses
[2:38:56.320 --> 2:39:00.440]  If you it's like it's like the night in the holy grail. He's chopped off his arms his legs
[2:39:00.440 --> 2:39:06.160]  It's merely his flesh wound. He's like hopping into us won't stop doesn't get we're destroying you listen dumbass
[2:39:06.160 --> 2:39:08.080]  And I'm not bragging into the Washington Post got
[2:39:08.840 --> 2:39:15.040]  Info wars according to quank cast and every other service is bigger than the New York Times as of six months ago
[2:39:15.240 --> 2:39:19.760]  The New York Times is much bigger than you. Yes, you've got big studios. Yes, you're up there
[2:39:19.760 --> 2:39:24.920]  You're a fop. You're a joke. You're a scammer and you sit there believing that you're all powerful
[2:39:24.920 --> 2:39:32.040]  We had 85 million viewers election week. Our new low is 41 million. You don't have 10 million readers a week dumbass
[2:39:32.760 --> 2:39:38.160]  People sit around at fake liberal coffee houses with the paper acting like they're intellectual reading your crap
[2:39:38.160 --> 2:39:40.160]  They don't read anything more than the headlines
[2:39:40.640 --> 2:39:42.640]  Other people use it for birdcage liner
[2:39:43.160 --> 2:39:45.160]  Okay, and I mean that literally
[2:39:45.160 --> 2:39:52.640]  Literally, you're a joke. You want to moralize us? I'll demoralize you you come from cowards and rats and scum
[2:39:52.640 --> 2:39:54.640]  It's why that's all you do
[2:39:54.920 --> 2:40:00.060]  Like certain species of dog does this certain does that certain breeds you act like a
[2:40:00.680 --> 2:40:01.840]  diseased
[2:40:01.840 --> 2:40:08.680]  Mental patient so I'm sorry. Let's let's let's let's let's finish the clip of the people that want to permanently tank markets to
[2:40:08.680 --> 2:40:15.000]  Control us in their own documents telling us that we that want to make America great again and just equalize the taxes globally
[2:40:15.000 --> 2:40:17.720]  So we got our jobs back that we're the bad and we're going to our guests
[2:40:18.040 --> 2:40:22.920]  We're going to our guests, but here it is. And the problem is not just a chaotic management theory
[2:40:22.920 --> 2:40:27.440]  It's actually a weird cycle by which he will stay on message for seven days
[2:40:27.440 --> 2:40:32.400]  and then all of a sudden feeling the morning he reads info wars and you know
[2:40:32.680 --> 2:40:38.000]  Sends off a tweet and goes off and then everyone has to go to the family and say can you get him back on the wagon?
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:44.520]  And then there's another crisis like you know process like this the presidency can't work that way
[2:40:44.520 --> 2:40:47.100]  You can tank markets. You can invite
[2:40:47.680 --> 2:40:53.560]  Incursions you can do a variety of things and the manner in which he both manages and
[2:40:54.840 --> 2:40:58.560]  His lack of control impulse control when it comes to those
[2:40:59.320 --> 2:41:02.080]  I don't know how that works in the presidency. It's gonna be fast
[2:41:02.080 --> 2:41:08.040]  Yeah, they all get these big cowardly rooms that have these little wimp consensus. I mean they all wear little nerdly glasses on purpose
[2:41:08.360 --> 2:41:14.040]  Accentuating I'm not against nerds, but I mean I'm saying these people are a joke people. These are the parasites now
[2:41:14.040 --> 2:41:18.400]  Let's go ahead and go to the next clip from one of our guests. This is Spicer says well Trump will absolutely use Twitter
[2:41:18.400 --> 2:41:24.920]  That's his spokesman as president. Well, why shouldn't he see everyone must go through this political elite that no one's watching
[2:41:25.120 --> 2:41:30.960]  No one's listening to you're like somebody in 1940 that just figured out that nobody's buying horse buggies anymore
[2:41:30.960 --> 2:41:37.240]  And you're like nobody's been buying these for 30 years. What the hell you gotta get back to riding horses to work
[2:41:37.240 --> 2:41:39.240]  I mean, what the hell?
[2:41:39.240 --> 2:41:41.240]  I'm gonna go out of business
[2:41:41.960 --> 2:41:45.240]  You ain't listening to us. You gotta go through us. Here it is
[2:41:46.640 --> 2:41:52.440]  Freaks the mainstream media that he has this following of over 45 plus million people that follow him on social media
[2:41:52.440 --> 2:41:55.480]  They can have a direct conversation. Yeah, it doesn't have to have it funneled through the media
[2:41:55.480 --> 2:41:59.400]  This is the this is going to be a business as usual is over as I've said before
[2:41:59.560 --> 2:42:04.320]  There's a new sheriff in town. He's gonna do things first and foremost for the American so we're still gonna see a lot of Twitter
[2:42:04.320 --> 2:42:09.560]  You're gonna see absolutely. You're gonna see Twitter. Why I said he was well. He had said on 60 minutes that he was gonna know what the
[2:42:09.560 --> 2:42:11.840]  Fact the matter is is that when he tweets he gets results
[2:42:11.840 --> 2:42:15.360]  So whether it's Twitter holding a news conference up the phone having yeah
[2:42:15.360 --> 2:42:20.280]  When I go some little Christian radio station a thousand once I get bigger response and going on CNN cuz they got zombies watching
[2:42:20.280 --> 2:42:22.280]  Let me give you a big Trump secret here
[2:42:22.400 --> 2:42:27.080]  And then we're gonna move on we're gonna sit over the next hour with our with our next guest here
[2:42:27.080 --> 2:42:28.440]  So I got a lot to cover
[2:42:28.440 --> 2:42:30.440]  But David Knight's coming in
[2:42:30.440 --> 2:42:32.440]  I
[2:42:33.920 --> 2:42:36.280]  Never got on Twitter because I knew it was a leftist thing
[2:42:36.280 --> 2:42:38.720]  I only got on a few years ago and you know
[2:42:38.720 --> 2:42:43.400]  So we only have like on all our Twitter's together about a million followers or our main one only like 500,000
[2:42:43.560 --> 2:42:50.560]  But Trump went on and was on apprentice only shows him a smart the whole time gathering pop culture connections as a database
[2:42:50.560 --> 2:42:53.680]  And he's been doing this for like 15 years
[2:42:53.680 --> 2:42:58.720]  And he's got all these other databases he can reach directly to the liberals and that's why they're so pissed are like
[2:42:58.720 --> 2:43:04.560]  Be presidential get rid of your connection to the 45 million liberals. We never get on Twitter because it's not a conservative audience
[2:43:04.560 --> 2:43:09.960]  That's why all our conservatives have to go get on real Alex Jones on Twitter so that we can communicate with you directly
[2:43:09.960 --> 2:43:11.520]  I know it's boring. I know it's stupid
[2:43:11.520 --> 2:43:17.200]  But it's where the wars are happening where you can attack these globalists on their own Twitter's Paul Watson such a genius at that
[2:43:17.200 --> 2:43:23.440]  You know, he's got 20 times the support and the reach on Twitter that I do because he knows how to use it
[2:43:23.920 --> 2:43:26.640]  But but again those of you out there with little Twitter accounts
[2:43:26.640 --> 2:43:30.080]  You can wreck them in the info war one more clever get this huge announcement
[2:43:30.080 --> 2:43:33.120]  Just giving this break coming up so we have more time with our great guest another great
[2:43:33.200 --> 2:43:37.040]  Americana innovator David Roberts founder of Tennessee arms company wait to hear about this
[2:43:37.120 --> 2:43:40.360]  But first off let's finish that next clip
[2:43:40.360 --> 2:43:46.360]  This is the CNN report that aired the fake footage and now they've been caught it's fake footage not of Russian hackers
[2:43:46.360 --> 2:43:52.520]  But a video game again, they think you're so dumb. They're telling you on screen. Look, we have video the Russian hackers
[2:43:52.520 --> 2:44:00.960]  So they're idiot audience goes I saw it. I saw it. Okay, this is how they manipulate and then they get caught and don't even retract it
[2:44:00.960 --> 2:44:07.380]  Here it is in spite of this and the US intelligence community's assessment that Russia ordered the election hacking
[2:44:07.600 --> 2:44:14.880]  President-elect Trump just last night continued to dismiss both Moscow's involvement and the importance of the hacking at all
[2:44:14.880 --> 2:44:19.720]  I think we're going to get on with our lives. I think the computers are complicated lives very great
[2:44:19.720 --> 2:44:21.720]  The whole
[2:44:21.920 --> 2:44:28.040]  Age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what's going on. Senator John McHugh
[2:44:28.600 --> 2:44:31.400]  Now again, can we cue it back up the fallout part right there?
[2:44:31.400 --> 2:44:36.120]  I want to show people this is a video game and I noticed they cut to make it look like his generals are 99 years old
[2:44:36.240 --> 2:44:39.640]  That was a World War two vet event with them wearing their uniforms
[2:44:39.800 --> 2:44:43.240]  I've seen a good look at the crazy Russian generals like a 99 year old guys
[2:44:43.240 --> 2:44:49.480]  Everything they do is a project manipulation wartime propaganda, but shifting gears out of that
[2:44:50.160 --> 2:44:56.720]  We had a big announcement to start the show today that we've got for the first time only law enforcement's got it the Pentagon's testing it
[2:44:57.280 --> 2:45:03.200]  It is a nanotube technology that the old stuff obviously first developed in Texas 15 20 years ago was toxic
[2:45:03.200 --> 2:45:08.200]  It's completely non-toxic to make that clear, but but it's totally sealed. It didn't even see the first layer
[2:45:08.200 --> 2:45:13.920]  Okay, when we shot it even with carbines with pistol rounds, they're coming out soon and we're the sole distributor
[2:45:13.920 --> 2:45:17.480]  We're so honored. I don't know how long it's gonna last but they're letting us roll it out of
[2:45:18.240 --> 2:45:24.920]  This made in America developed in Texas system. Now couple of that is David Roberts. Now. I want to be clear
[2:45:25.920 --> 2:45:27.920]  I'm gonna let you cue because you know this guy. Well
[2:45:28.520 --> 2:45:31.080]  Break this down and any more comes for a long time. I
[2:45:32.000 --> 2:45:36.280]  Didn't ever do the lowers because these a lot of companies had problems fly by night
[2:45:36.280 --> 2:45:41.160]  Whatever and then I learned what this company went out and got as usual the best they originated it over time
[2:45:41.160 --> 2:45:46.800]  They perfected it they invented the copper inserts so that they just keep going and going and many times more than aluminum
[2:45:46.800 --> 2:45:51.160]  I got steel 30,000 to 60,000 is what the third-party ratings are. It's just insane
[2:45:52.000 --> 2:45:59.320]  And this is something totally private to you. No record. They have the ATF letter. It's on info wars.com saying this is completely legal and lawful
[2:45:59.680 --> 2:46:04.840]  In minutes, you've got a third you can drill out now again
[2:46:04.840 --> 2:46:10.200]  I've never done this because I only wanted to have the very best. Well, this is the best a veteran owned
[2:46:11.360 --> 2:46:18.680]  Marine Force recon. This is the company. He's had several companies and so so break this down and introduce this guy
[2:46:19.240 --> 2:46:24.520]  Because it's simply amazing info wars store.com. I don't want to say we have their entire line because it's custom
[2:46:24.520 --> 2:46:33.360]  We have their entire line and more hundreds of designs Magpole matching colors on and on and on and and with this laser etching
[2:46:33.360 --> 2:46:36.920]  We're gonna get it where it's actually almost even personalized. You can sit in what you want and do that
[2:46:36.920 --> 2:46:43.040]  But we've got still dozens and I guess it's hundreds of different designs right now from Olaan Labe to Paul Revere to George Washington
[2:46:43.040 --> 2:46:47.800]  To I'll do some commemorative, you know Trump 45, you know, we're you know return of the Republic
[2:46:47.800 --> 2:46:51.440]  We're adding more every day and if you don't want to customize it just want it straight up
[2:46:51.440 --> 2:46:58.480]  You know all murdered out in black or olive grab or whatever. We've got it infowarstore.com. This is so amazing on so many fronts and again
[2:46:59.000 --> 2:47:02.560]  We're taking the Republic back. We're excited. We're breaking the globalist will of us
[2:47:02.560 --> 2:47:06.520]  I'm literally this exciting. We'll see how do you keep doing? Are you on drugs? No, we're kicking the globalist ass
[2:47:06.600 --> 2:47:12.360]  We've got the best lower company. We're just this guy's battled in court and is is the number one god patented
[2:47:12.360 --> 2:47:17.560]  He's the king daddy. We've got him. So Q and Pat great job. Talk about it. Let's introduce this guys
[2:47:17.560 --> 2:47:20.440]  We're gonna go a little bit about 10 minutes to the next hour. Let me hand it over to David Knight
[2:47:20.760 --> 2:47:24.280]  All right, absolutely would like that. I'm feeling good. Are you high on Liberty? Oh, absolutely
[2:47:25.040 --> 2:47:26.960]  That's a little more
[2:47:26.960 --> 2:47:32.440]  You know, oh, man, we want to introduce David Rock get this guy right now
[2:47:36.720 --> 2:47:40.320]  Just gets my energy going you forgot your glasses. I did you don't even look smart
[2:47:40.320 --> 2:47:44.800]  Do you let me rough him up this morning? Yeah, he lost have a little chicken neck. I just had it with this beard
[2:47:45.600 --> 2:47:47.600]  We want to introduce David Roberts
[2:47:47.680 --> 2:47:50.300]  owner of Tennessee arms give him a chance to
[2:47:50.300 --> 2:47:57.780]  Discuss his product and tell us what we already know but tell you guys what it is about this product that makes it the absolute best
[2:47:57.780 --> 2:48:02.140]  Yeah, I mean, this is no high folks. I know that's why I've never done this people. How much money could I make?
[2:48:02.140 --> 2:48:06.020]  I'm not gonna even like Jesse James awesome guy wants to work with me. He's great. I know he's the best
[2:48:06.020 --> 2:48:10.940]  We're gonna do it with him too. He's got the entire NRA catalog done. You know that boom first David Roberts
[2:48:11.780 --> 2:48:18.180]  Nanotech everything the best sorry David tell us about your products and we're very very happy that you're letting us distribute them
[2:48:18.180 --> 2:48:22.140]  Thank you, sir. Well, I'd really like to thank you for letting me be on the show and
[2:48:22.820 --> 2:48:29.100]  What we started out with was the AR 15, you know, it's a proven design has been used for you know
[2:48:29.100 --> 2:48:34.180]  Decades, but it was a design that was made in 1959 and you know, as you can imagine, you know
[2:48:34.180 --> 2:48:36.180]  We've done wonderful things with
[2:48:36.940 --> 2:48:44.660]  Material science and you know the engineering that is that is column since then so one of the first things we looked at was the receiver and
[2:48:44.660 --> 2:48:50.780]  You know, basically what we did was we started questioning. We started wondering what can we do different to you know
[2:48:50.780 --> 2:48:53.740]  Get this weight down and you know to make this thing, you know bring
[2:48:53.740 --> 2:48:58.420]  Sure, when I was a kid I shot m16s and stuff that were even full auto. They just didn't work good over time
[2:48:58.420 --> 2:49:02.580]  I'm not expert on the names of the m4s have gotten more and more perfected and the word is you perfected the lower
[2:49:03.500 --> 2:49:05.100]  We did
[2:49:05.100 --> 2:49:10.940]  The way we did it was by lowering the weight and using space-age materials now when I say space-age we
[2:49:10.940 --> 2:49:17.820]  What we're doing is it basically just taking an automotive grade polymer that has been in use and it's in use in your cars
[2:49:17.820 --> 2:49:19.300]  We make the
[2:49:19.300 --> 2:49:24.220]  Automotive suspensions for a rough country suspensions here in this town. So I mean we understand polymers
[2:49:24.220 --> 2:49:30.620]  We understand how they work we understand their strength and weaknesses and we incorporated that design into the AR 15 receiver
[2:49:30.820 --> 2:49:32.820]  But one of polymer
[2:49:32.900 --> 2:49:38.180]  Weaknesses doesn't hold threads very well and that's where a lot of our competitors have problems is you know
[2:49:38.180 --> 2:49:42.860]  They try to make this all polymer part and it's just not what that does
[2:49:43.180 --> 2:49:48.900]  So what we do is we actually put the metal inserts in to hold the threads and to strengthen it while still getting the
[2:49:50.260 --> 2:49:54.900]  The strength and the light weight and the color that goes all the way through the material by using the polymer
[2:49:55.420 --> 2:49:57.780]  And I'm showing the laser etching happening right now
[2:49:57.780 --> 2:50:03.140]  But just be clear that you took basically automotive engineers technology things perfect in the auto injury
[2:50:03.140 --> 2:50:10.020]  Industry and then took it with the cult you know M16 type receiver I guess for a AR 15 now and just upgraded it
[2:50:10.020 --> 2:50:12.380]  Everybody tried to copy it, but they say you're the best
[2:50:13.180 --> 2:50:18.220]  Well that and I didn't I did patent it. So you've battled in court and won that
[2:50:18.700 --> 2:50:24.260]  Yes, I did. It was it was pretty ugly. You know, we did invent it. We did come up with it
[2:50:24.700 --> 2:50:26.900]  We were very quickly copied
[2:50:27.500 --> 2:50:31.140]  So, you know, that just tells you that you know, we were owned to something
[2:50:31.140 --> 2:50:36.940]  Absolutely, but so what we what we did was we actually took, you know a basic AR 15 design
[2:50:36.940 --> 2:50:42.020]  Which is a really good design and we just updated it and brought it into the into this century
[2:50:42.020 --> 2:50:47.020]  And what we're doing is actually most of our customers are people that build their own AR 15s
[2:50:47.420 --> 2:50:53.180]  Because as you well know, you know that the best way to understand how weapon system works is to build it yourself and understand it
[2:50:53.180 --> 2:50:58.020]  And these are so affordable and we've got them in one pack five packs ten packs
[2:50:58.020 --> 2:51:02.240]  You can get them naked you can get them. I guess it's no additional charge customized all these designs
[2:51:02.420 --> 2:51:04.940]  Sooner or never you actually email us and we can send it to you and have it done
[2:51:04.940 --> 2:51:08.060]  It's gonna be a little bit more obviously to have them loaded in and do it with the laser and everything
[2:51:08.060 --> 2:51:10.060]  But I mean, this is amazing
[2:51:10.420 --> 2:51:15.740]  Showing breakdown basically how somebody legally and lawfully does this because we've got the ATF letter on the site
[2:51:15.740 --> 2:51:17.860]  And that's why it works. I mean, I've been a given offers
[2:51:17.860 --> 2:51:21.940]  Let me not exaggerate by probably every other company out there that does lowers and I just did research
[2:51:21.940 --> 2:51:25.220]  I did reviews. It's just there's a lot of crap out there. I'm sorry folks
[2:51:25.220 --> 2:51:28.780]  This is the place to get it and the blessings the provenance
[2:51:28.780 --> 2:51:33.660]  We keep having like the best body armor company hands down about to go department defense wide boom
[2:51:33.660 --> 2:51:38.300]  We get it the other product. We're gonna be announcing soon. I mean, it's just it's just incredible
[2:51:38.300 --> 2:51:44.100]  You know, you'll see it in Dixon Walmart in six months. We get it first special forces using it for ten years classified
[2:51:44.500 --> 2:51:48.380]  Kills bacteria everything. Nobody's got this. I mean, this is like the next colloidal silver
[2:51:48.380 --> 2:51:53.380]  I'm not I just can't believe the winning you're gonna get so sick of winning. You're gonna say, please stop winning
[2:51:53.380 --> 2:51:57.540]  I'll say no, it's the spirit of the Republic. Just get ready. We're the best
[2:51:58.660 --> 2:52:00.060]  sorry
[2:52:00.060 --> 2:52:06.860]  And honestly, you know when you know Q came to me about this originally about you know partnering with your organization
[2:52:06.860 --> 2:52:10.220]  And you know, one of the first things I asked was you know, what what kind of man is he?
[2:52:10.220 --> 2:52:13.500]  You know, what kind of company does he run because I knew Q
[2:52:13.500 --> 2:52:15.660]  I knew you'd shoot me straight and you know
[2:52:15.660 --> 2:52:20.140]  He told me that you know you and your company would be somebody that I'd want to partner with and you know get a little good
[2:52:20.140 --> 2:52:24.780]  Long-time partner we can tell you've been busy working making guns that you don't know about him for us
[2:52:26.140 --> 2:52:29.500]  That's awesome though, brother. It's good. I mean listen, you're the best. It's amazing
[2:52:29.500 --> 2:52:32.780]  I've heard about Tennessee arms so long and the other companies you pioneered the stuff you developed
[2:52:32.780 --> 2:52:36.540]  It's incredible. Let's get more into these because again for the layperson out there
[2:52:37.260 --> 2:52:41.620]  Let's go to the legalese like it's 80% done. It's very easy to do. We're gonna have a video
[2:52:41.620 --> 2:52:42.700]  We actually shot a yesterday
[2:52:42.700 --> 2:52:46.940]  We're gonna have which shows me even in there doing it Q doing it and I'm on a machinist and I did a pretty good job
[2:52:46.940 --> 2:52:53.540]  Explain how this works the whole genre to folks for people that aren't informed who are thinking about building their own firearm
[2:52:53.700 --> 2:52:56.780]  This isn't the firearm, but it's the key lower and how people can do it
[2:52:57.620 --> 2:53:04.100]  Absolutely well the way the ATF regulations work is the only thing that's considered a firearm is the receiver itself
[2:53:04.100 --> 2:53:08.540]  The part that holds the serial number, but it's completely legal to build your own firearm at home
[2:53:08.540 --> 2:53:12.220]  And the way we you know do that is we give you a
[2:53:12.220 --> 2:53:17.100]  Piece of the receiver basically the outside dimensions in the magazine that
[2:53:17.620 --> 2:53:22.340]  Meets those regulations, but it doesn't hit what the ATF considers to be a firearm
[2:53:22.340 --> 2:53:27.740]  So these can be shipped, you know over the mail. They can be shipped directly to your house. There's no background check
[2:53:27.740 --> 2:53:31.940]  It's all completely legal and this shows bureaucratic idiocy. Have this been around since like the 20s
[2:53:32.660 --> 2:53:36.180]  This has been around forever. Yeah, basically. Well, I mean and to be honest with you
[2:53:36.700 --> 2:53:38.700]  Americans have been building guns since before there was an America
[2:53:38.700 --> 2:53:46.060]  Exactly going after guns is what I'm saying is this law it's from the 20s, isn't it?
[2:53:46.860 --> 2:53:51.060]  I'm not sure it. I think it's always been legal. I don't think the law itself even
[2:53:51.500 --> 2:53:54.700]  It was never illegal to not build your own gun. Well, I mean exactly
[2:53:54.700 --> 2:53:59.740]  I'm saying this particular what they consider the firearm just the just the just the the stamp ID
[2:54:00.380 --> 2:54:02.140]  It's crazy as I understand it
[2:54:02.140 --> 2:54:07.700]  It is you know with the that comes with the marking variations and you know their regulations of what they actually consider
[2:54:07.700 --> 2:54:11.580]  The point is there's a lot of dangerous stuff out there. Don't just say this to you know as marketing
[2:54:11.580 --> 2:54:15.340]  It's true. I haven't been involved in it. You're the biggest. You're the cleanest. You're the originator
[2:54:15.340 --> 2:54:19.540]  You're the best you've got the ATF letter these other people literally I'm like, okay
[2:54:19.540 --> 2:54:25.420]  Let me see an ATF letter like oh, we'll get you that never comes and I were like people like these ads like it shoots full auto
[2:54:25.420 --> 2:54:29.500]  By our lower. I'm like dude. That's illegal without a tax stamp. I'm no expert on this stuff
[2:54:29.500 --> 2:54:35.100]  But I know there's a minefield of idiocy with this stuff. Oh, it never stops. It never stops
[2:54:35.100 --> 2:54:40.020]  You know, there's a lot of hype in the industry and you know one things that you really want to get by is you don't want
[2:54:40.020 --> 2:54:43.780]  You don't want to kick the hornet's nest of the ATF. You want to do things correctly
[2:54:43.780 --> 2:54:46.100]  You want to do it right and you can you know
[2:54:46.100 --> 2:54:49.880]  You guys can give us the blueprint to follow the law to the gold standard
[2:54:50.580 --> 2:54:55.660]  Absolutely, and you know, let's say you're an average guy living in Tennessee or Texas or wherever
[2:54:56.220 --> 2:54:58.700]  And you want to your northern, California?
[2:54:58.700 --> 2:55:02.300]  It should be at some state great place and you want to be able to build your own farm as a hobby
[2:55:02.300 --> 2:55:07.460]  Teach your son daughter how to do it, you know to have your own original America on a firearm that didn't didn't come off an assembly line
[2:55:07.460 --> 2:55:10.980]  That's cool. I'm gonna do some of my son and daughters. How do they do it?
[2:55:11.460 --> 2:55:12.580]  well
[2:55:12.580 --> 2:55:17.700]  All of our receivers, you know it unless you are using like an easy jig or you know
[2:55:17.700 --> 2:55:20.100]  One of the other commercially available jigs that help you build it
[2:55:20.100 --> 2:55:27.300]  But our receipt our jig that comes with the receiver is actually helps you drill it out and you know using the
[2:55:27.300 --> 2:55:33.060]  Supplied instruction. Let's be clear. It's almost like coloring by numbers with your jig. You're the jig is the encasement
[2:55:33.420 --> 2:55:35.420]  that the resin and
[2:55:35.540 --> 2:55:36.660]  copper
[2:55:36.660 --> 2:55:39.100]  System lowers in to make sure you do it just right
[2:55:39.860 --> 2:55:44.100]  Absolutely, and we we tried to make this as easy as possible and still stay within the law
[2:55:44.260 --> 2:55:47.580]  So what we did was we made the jig itself
[2:55:47.660 --> 2:55:51.100]  It holds that receiver in very tightly so you can keep the tolerances
[2:55:51.300 --> 2:55:56.700]  But the only tools that are needed are basically a drill press a little bit of sandpaper and maybe a dremel tool
[2:55:56.700 --> 2:55:59.820]  You can get by with less, but if you really want to do a good job
[2:55:59.820 --> 2:56:04.380]  That's what you're so it's harder to build a model airplane, you know when you're ten years old than to do this
[2:56:05.500 --> 2:56:08.140]  Yes, this is basically an adult Legos
[2:56:08.580 --> 2:56:13.580]  So Dave tell them tell them why you chose marine grade brass and explain to them
[2:56:14.540 --> 2:56:16.540]  Where and why you?
[2:56:18.140 --> 2:56:20.140]  Reinforce the areas of the polymer lower
[2:56:20.140 --> 2:56:29.020]  Absolutely, one of the things we did was we looked at anything that had a thread because those threads itself make the material very thin and very weak
[2:56:29.140 --> 2:56:36.620]  So what we did was by using the marine grade brass and we use brass for the ease of machining and the lack of dissimilar metal issues
[2:56:36.620 --> 2:56:39.820]  When you put two metals together that are dissimilar you can cause corrosion issues
[2:56:39.900 --> 2:56:43.420]  There are a lot of things that can that can happen by using the wrong metal
[2:56:43.420 --> 2:56:47.580]  So and that's where the science background comes in and that's why this took so long to perfect
[2:56:47.580 --> 2:56:53.700]  But by using that brass insert, you know, you don't have corrosion problems. You've got great strength and
[2:56:54.180 --> 2:56:56.380]  You know it's very easy to machine
[2:56:56.380 --> 2:57:01.900]  So it keeps our production level high and our costs low and we pass out along to the consumers
[2:57:01.900 --> 2:57:05.820]  I was about to add that I've done my own research. Yeah, I'm on a gun expert
[2:57:05.820 --> 2:57:10.660]  I go see other lowers that are crappy or like twice the price people just I mean
[2:57:10.660 --> 2:57:15.660]  It's this is the place to get your lower info or store com and they've allowed us with all this laser etching
[2:57:15.660 --> 2:57:22.180]  They've got with these incredible lasers to do all this, you know, come and take it. Don't tread on me info wars defend the Republic
[2:57:22.500 --> 2:57:24.500]  We're gonna come out with a
[2:57:25.020 --> 2:57:26.660]  inauguration of Trump
[2:57:26.660 --> 2:57:32.980]  2017 special, but I don't wait till he actually gets there. I don't want to celebrate prematurely a lot of exciting things ladies and gentlemen
[2:57:32.980 --> 2:57:38.500]  It's key to bring back building your own firearms. That's what this is all about. This is a great great thing
[2:57:38.500 --> 2:57:42.140]  Do you know for your school project for science class to show a video though?
[2:57:42.140 --> 2:57:46.980]  Don't don't bring it into school. They'll freak out by that. I mean, there's just so many angles of this now
[2:57:46.980 --> 2:57:50.940]  Now these are really affordable. Let's talk about the cost an info or store calm
[2:57:50.940 --> 2:57:55.180]  There's no reviews yet, but on your site that you've got the five-star reviews. We just launched today
[2:57:55.180 --> 2:58:00.220]  I mean how easy it is to put these together and and how much they cost we've got all the colors
[2:58:00.220 --> 2:58:02.220]  We've got a different packs you name it
[2:58:03.220 --> 2:58:10.880]  Exactly well, you know one of the things that we that we do is we because of our process because of the high pressure injection molding
[2:58:10.880 --> 2:58:13.280]  We can make thousands of these things a day
[2:58:13.400 --> 2:58:19.480]  So by doing that we can keep our costs low and we pass that along to you know to our customers and for people like you were
[2:58:19.480 --> 2:58:24.600]  Distribute our product and that's right. I've also read a lot of people have this third party done
[2:58:24.600 --> 2:58:28.080]  That's why they make you wait so long. They're getting them done like China and stuff. Is that true?
[2:58:30.200 --> 2:58:31.720]  Yes
[2:58:31.720 --> 2:58:37.720]  Nobody's really come out front and said, you know, this is what we're doing. This is how we're doing it because they're not a

[3:00:18.600 --> 3:00:19.800]  Oh the info
[3:00:19.800 --> 3:00:26.440]  Remember the variation of a 223 a 556, but can I shoot stuff at 450 yards? I've seen it
[3:00:26.760 --> 3:00:29.240]  Okay, so so yeah, I can't cook hands
[3:00:29.880 --> 3:00:35.320]  So so I don't know all the names of all the crap dear like I don't know the names all these wrestling moves

[3:01:06.320 --> 3:01:08.320]  Sorry go ahead mr roberts
[3:01:08.560 --> 3:01:11.600]  well, well, I really appreciate it, but uh, you know, it's uh
[3:01:12.480 --> 3:01:17.120]  You know talking about 450 yards. I you know, I've shot with Q quite a bit. You might out shoot him
[3:01:17.120 --> 3:01:21.360]  I'm just saying well Q didn't take the shot. He has offered the shot. He didn't take it
[3:01:22.000 --> 3:01:24.000]  Yeah, there's a reason
[3:01:26.080 --> 3:01:31.360]  I'm not trying to brag. I'm just a genius. I'm so excited about trump. We just beat obama's q q
[3:01:31.440 --> 3:01:35.600]  I got the word this morning from the full deal. We just blew the I'm not wrong. It's exciting
[3:01:35.680 --> 3:01:42.160]  I'm sorry go mr roberts. Please continue. Yes, please continue. We just saved america. Ha ha ha. I'm sorry. It's so damn good
[3:01:42.160 --> 3:01:47.040]  Whoo, man get off the champagne. We're not out of the woods yet, but it looks good
[3:01:47.200 --> 3:01:51.440]  Sorry, we're not new york times is turning against old baller right now. Yeah, there's ha ha oh man
[3:01:51.760 --> 3:01:55.520]  Go god. I'm not trying. I'm sorry. It's just starting to hit me right now. I'm sorry mr roberts
[3:01:55.600 --> 3:01:57.600]  Please continue about the look with the lowers
[3:01:58.320 --> 3:02:05.200]  Well, um, we've we've covered most of it. I mean basically, you know, we're doing is just letting people actually build and understand their
[3:02:05.200 --> 3:02:11.520]  Um, their rifle like they should, you know, the only way to truly understand a rifle is to actually take it apart and put it back together
[3:02:11.600 --> 3:02:13.760]  And there's no better way of doing that and just building it yourself
[3:02:13.840 --> 3:02:17.360]  Well, that's what I would by buying a 80% lower the people
[3:02:18.000 --> 3:02:20.560]  Don't have to register it. There's not a serial number
[3:02:20.960 --> 3:02:25.200]  But it's a family heirloom, right? It's something that only belongs to you. You can't sell it
[3:02:25.280 --> 3:02:28.080]  That's key. You cannot ever transfer this explain that
[3:02:28.800 --> 3:02:31.920]  Right, Dave. So whatever it is if you produce your
[3:02:31.920 --> 3:02:36.400]  80% lower you create a firearm that firearm belongs to you for life
[3:02:37.040 --> 3:02:38.160]  It does
[3:02:38.160 --> 3:02:41.200]  Yep, let me tell a story since you brought this up. I don't know about guns
[3:02:41.200 --> 3:02:46.960]  But when I used to still go sign DVDs at the gun show because you know, it was back then I mean, I'd sell like a thousand DVDs
[3:02:46.960 --> 3:02:52.400]  I don't pay the bills. We're talking just like 14 years ago. I was still going out in public. You know, now I can't really do it
[3:02:52.400 --> 3:02:53.440]  And
[3:02:53.440 --> 3:02:58.320]  They'd have people come over and go, hey, I lost my driver's license even guys that kind of we covered sign for this gun
[3:02:58.320 --> 3:03:00.320]  There'd be ATF wait. I was like, oh my god
[3:03:00.320 --> 3:03:05.040]  And then another time like out front. Hey Alex buy my thing. It's got a custom lower
[3:03:05.040 --> 3:03:09.520]  And they were they were so dumb. They I was like, oh my they're about to set me up. So let's explain
[3:03:09.520 --> 3:03:14.000]  This is legal and lawful. You cannot sell this explain this to us, please
[3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:20.320]  Well, um, actually there's an ATF form that you can fill out and you know, basically you just go through a real simple process
[3:03:20.320 --> 3:03:24.320]  Like I said, it's you know, they so if you file it in you then can sell it
[3:03:24.320 --> 3:03:26.320]  You just can't before you do that sell it
[3:03:26.320 --> 3:03:30.480]  Well, you end up giving it a serial number and whatever and then it's just a regular firearm. Yeah, so
[3:03:30.480 --> 3:03:33.680]  That's what I'm saying. You're the expert. I mean explain it to me explain to me
[3:03:33.680 --> 3:03:38.320]  Well, until you do anything with it until you mill it out and you know, make it a working firearm
[3:03:38.320 --> 3:03:43.360]  It's just another it's a doorstop. So you could sell it or give it away at that point
[3:03:43.360 --> 3:03:48.320]  But but once you've milled it out once you build it out though, you've got to turn it into a firearm if you ever want to sell it
[3:03:48.320 --> 3:03:54.320]  You do because they're because they're not tracked and if you're keeping it for your own use then
[3:03:54.320 --> 3:03:56.320]  You know
[3:03:56.320 --> 3:04:02.320]  Then you know, you just fill out an ATF form and you know, it's your typical user at home
[3:04:02.320 --> 3:04:10.320]  Comes to info war store calm picks up one of these lower receiver 80% with the jig follows the basic instructions
[3:04:10.320 --> 3:04:12.320]  Complete it snap and running
[3:04:12.320 --> 3:04:14.320]  AR 15 lower
[3:04:14.320 --> 3:04:18.320]  As long as they maintain it and their possession and never give it to anyone else
[3:04:18.320 --> 3:04:25.320]  It doesn't require a serial number and it does not require any type of background investigation or registration
[3:04:25.320 --> 3:04:26.320]  No, it is
[3:04:26.320 --> 3:04:29.320]  And you guys walk through that on the website. We have all your same paperwork on info wars

[3:09:42.320 --> 3:09:47.320]  So I'm gonna go ahead and interrupt Q and he's gonna talk about the amazing warranty, but I want to talk about the actual project
[3:09:47.320 --> 3:09:53.320]  So you get the product you get a really regular gel press. It's really easy and Q's like a gorilla and he's able to do it
[3:09:53.320 --> 3:09:58.320]  Yep, there he is doing it. That's amazing a lot there. That should tell you that I'm smart enough to do it
[3:09:58.320 --> 3:10:00.320]  That hands never done anything bad. I'll tell you that
[3:10:00.320 --> 3:10:04.320]  Yeah, that's the margin we use when we decide it if you can do it we knew anybody
[3:10:04.320 --> 3:10:14.320]  But seriously you put it in a drill press you make a couple drills you go ahead and finish it off with the dremel or sandpaper
[3:10:14.320 --> 3:10:17.320]  It's very easy and there you go. It's done. It's complete
[3:10:17.320 --> 3:10:23.320]  I mean it is simple one of the one of the added benefits of using a polymer is you don't have to refinish
[3:10:23.320 --> 3:10:27.320]  If you did an 80% in metal you would have to go back and somehow protect that metal
[3:10:27.320 --> 3:10:34.320]  Well an aluminum which is what almost all receivers are made out of gets a lot of its strength from the tight to anodization
[3:10:34.320 --> 3:10:38.320]  That's on the top. It's a hard-code anodization. It's not a regular anodization
[3:10:38.320 --> 3:10:40.320]  And you make a mistake and cut through that you're screwed
[3:10:40.320 --> 3:10:47.320]  Well not just that that aluminum is very soft that it really needs that hard-code anodization and you're not gonna do that at the house
[3:10:47.320 --> 3:10:51.320]  Well, that's what I saw in third-party reviews before I I have to interrupt
[3:10:51.320 --> 3:10:56.320]  I'm not a gun guy, but I saw the experts saying what's so great about yours is I was reading they're better than a lot of aluminum
[3:10:56.320 --> 3:10:59.320]  For half the price because it doesn't have that problem
[3:10:59.320 --> 3:11:04.320]  Exactly. Well because the material is exactly the same on the surface as it is in the middle
[3:11:04.320 --> 3:11:10.320]  When you mill our ours out and you know make it a functioning firearm there's nothing else to do
[3:11:10.320 --> 3:11:14.320]  You just mill it out and you're done. You don't have to finish it. You don't have to do anything
[3:11:14.320 --> 3:11:19.320]  You just sand it to make it pretty you know to make sure and it's you know I like it's hard to screw up
[3:11:19.320 --> 3:11:25.320]  But they're so inexpensive if you did I've heard you've got a money-back guarantee that's that's that's unrivaled
[3:11:25.320 --> 3:11:28.320]  We do we cover everything to include stupidity
[3:11:28.320 --> 3:11:31.320]  That if you do something dumb we replace that
[3:11:31.320 --> 3:11:35.320]  See people that's why it's so excited it's the whole package with Tennessee Arms explain that
[3:11:35.320 --> 3:11:41.320]  So about a year ago I had called Dave on a cell phone speakerphone
[3:11:41.320 --> 3:11:46.320]  A young man had come into the gun store where I was doing some work and said hey I have this Tennessee Arms lower
[3:11:46.320 --> 3:11:51.320]  And I broke it and whatever he didn't know that I knew Dave so I pulled my phone out of my pocket set it on the counter
[3:11:51.320 --> 3:11:55.320]  Well tell the whole story you're like this is crap and you were there doing firearms training
[3:11:55.320 --> 3:11:57.320]  You were just helping a friend out doing behind the register deal
[3:11:57.320 --> 3:11:59.320]  He told me the whole story comes in and we tell the whole story we got time
[3:11:59.320 --> 3:12:03.320]  He comes in he's complaining he's like I bought this polymer lower it's a piece of crap
[3:12:03.320 --> 3:12:07.320]  I did this this miss it broke on me and I said I'm pretty sure they just don't break
[3:12:07.320 --> 3:12:12.320]  Well the long story was using one of these pins he hit it with a hammer
[3:12:12.320 --> 3:12:15.320]  Well when he hit it with a hammer he broke it
[3:12:15.320 --> 3:12:20.320]  It's not designed to be hit with a hammer although we can do it
[3:12:20.320 --> 3:12:27.320]  So I pick out my phone I put it on the counter and I called Dave and I said hey Dave I got one of your POS lowers here and it's broke
[3:12:27.320 --> 3:12:29.320]  And what do you want to do about it?
[3:12:29.320 --> 3:12:32.320]  I think that was a quote actually I remembered that and almost cussed him
[3:12:32.320 --> 3:12:37.320]  And his quote was send it back no questions asked I'll finish it I'll fix it
[3:12:37.320 --> 3:12:43.320]  And I said okay real deal this is what happened a guy sanded some hit it with a hammer broke the end of it
[3:12:43.320 --> 3:12:45.320]  And now it's broke
[3:12:45.320 --> 3:12:49.320]  Dave said no questions asked send it back to me we'll replace it
[3:12:49.320 --> 3:13:01.320]  Young man came back in 10 days later Dave actually gave him a custom laser finish to make him a little happy for his inconvenience
[3:13:01.320 --> 3:13:05.320]  But he came back in with the lower happy as can be
[3:13:05.320 --> 3:13:17.320]  So it just is a it's a testimonial to how well their customer services their actual no questions asked warranty is exactly that
[3:13:17.320 --> 3:13:20.320]  Again unconditional lifetime warranty
[3:13:20.320 --> 3:13:26.320]  And what's great is again I'm not a rocket scientist I get all these names wrong all I know is the top experts I talked to say this is the deal
[3:13:26.320 --> 3:13:32.320]  That's why it's on our lap thinks that you guys I'm so blessed for the audience because again in the decade I've been offered so many of these deals
[3:13:32.320 --> 3:13:39.320]  Even by folks that sound pretty good but then I just it just you know that I hear and I go check and I spend hours on each sponsor that wants to come here
[3:13:39.320 --> 3:13:44.320]  Even before I even look at doing it and then they get pissy or they get weird or they want this or they want that
[3:13:44.320 --> 3:13:48.320]  I'm like listen I can just sell t-shirts and you know great vitamins people I don't need this
[3:13:48.320 --> 3:13:57.320]  This is like good Americana it's high quality it's the best and I want to be able to say I'm bringing you the developer a patriot who's one in court
[3:13:57.320 --> 3:14:03.320]  It's his he has the best ratings everyone says hands down the best with that it just syncs up with my worldview
[3:14:03.320 --> 3:14:11.320]  I mean I've kind of got no CD where if I cannot bring you the best at an affordable price I will not do it it's like I will not treat you like I don't want to be treated
[3:14:11.320 --> 3:14:18.320]  And the more I live that it's like every door opens the Providence just intensifies and that's what this is all about folks so
[3:14:18.320 --> 3:14:24.320]  Again I mean be safe with these follow the rules just know that and check out you take full responsibility
[3:14:24.320 --> 3:14:31.320]  But my responsibility is you be the best quality follows the ATF rules laws everything else infowarstore.com
[3:14:31.320 --> 3:14:34.320]  Whether it's one packs I don't know if we've added that yet five packs ten packs
[3:14:34.320 --> 3:14:35.320]  We're adding it next week
[3:14:35.320 --> 3:14:39.320]  Yeah because you won't be able to customize when you do that obviously I guess you could do all of one or whatever
[3:14:39.320 --> 3:14:41.320]  If you've got some great ideas send them to us where you know
[3:14:41.320 --> 3:14:47.320]  Yeah send us your designs I mean because we're going to get it where how much do you think it'll cost you're off the top of your head if we do individual customize
[3:14:47.320 --> 3:14:54.320]  Because I know having a technician load it in the computer then add shit you might mess I mean that might cost as much as the receiver just to have it totally custom
[3:14:54.320 --> 3:14:57.320]  We're just trying to add hundreds of designs I mean how would that work
[3:14:57.320 --> 3:14:58.320]  If we think it they'll build it
[3:14:58.320 --> 3:14:59.320]  Sure
[3:14:59.320 --> 3:15:08.320]  Yeah yeah we we've gotten pretty good at this you know we've got it down to an art actually my brother who started this you know business with me at the end of 25
[3:15:08.320 --> 3:15:19.320]  At the end of 2013 when I you know left Afghanistan and quit contracting but he started this with me he basically runs all of the engraving he gets does a wonderful job
[3:15:19.320 --> 3:15:28.320]  He does crazy things with the laser and as you can well see in the video that I couldn't do you know it's like I've got a computer background but I don't have the level of detail that he does
[3:15:28.320 --> 3:15:38.320]  I'll tell you what's exciting I'm seeing all these vets that the globalist tried to block and try to not give jobs just start their own companies because they were blocked by Obama on this plan to get rid of the weapons
[3:15:38.320 --> 3:15:49.320]  And to see everywhere I go all the best industry all the best innovations from whether it's a car dealership or restaurant or manufacturing it's our vets that are bringing America back and I don't mean that to kiss the military's ass
[3:15:49.320 --> 3:16:01.320]  When I saw the globalist trying to use the military against America 20 years ago I got very not anti military but anti the stance but our military came through in flying colors and became the information warfare resistance to everything
[3:16:01.320 --> 3:16:12.320]  And it's been those veterans in private corporations and in the government and the intelligence agencies that have never faltered and we're going to take all these globalists and just remove them I'm sorry go ahead
[3:16:12.320 --> 3:16:24.320]  Well even my brother Air Force veteran you know used to work on avionics for the Air Force and you know it's that level of detail and that technical ability that he brought into here and I couldn't have
[3:16:24.320 --> 3:16:28.320]  Well it really is true our veterans are the very best people we've got it's just true
[3:16:28.320 --> 3:16:35.320]  When I tell you day or night I can call this guy and he'll pick up his phone just like you you'll work equally as hard
[3:16:35.320 --> 3:16:43.320]  Well it's my baby you know it's it's not just a product to me it's something that you know I've put my heart and soul
[3:16:43.320 --> 3:16:53.320]  Look at the snowflake generation versus our veterans that actually have to go out do things be accountable I mean it's almost like it's the only place where survival the fittest was still in place
[3:16:53.320 --> 3:17:01.320]  It's like the only men left I mean and I was in the military but my parents a lot of them had been involved in things and they were just like we're not going to do anything for you
[3:17:01.320 --> 3:17:06.320]  You're gonna have to go oh you got both your eyes black fight harder and to thank God I thought my parents were mean it was great
[3:17:06.320 --> 3:17:12.320]  Because because they were giving me it's like a plant doesn't grow in space or humans die on a mission to Mars because your muscles aren't moving
[3:17:12.320 --> 3:17:16.320]  You know we're not exercising any of this we're turning into jellyfish
[3:17:16.320 --> 3:17:21.320]  Making men again making men men again you know it's okay to act like that
[3:17:21.320 --> 3:17:26.320]  Victor Hugo the French philosopher said prosperity makes monsters adversity makes men
[3:17:26.320 --> 3:17:37.320]  Well getting back to the lowers again and then folks I guess I mean can you recommend because I don't know now that I guess it's legal to sell all the other parts with it as well
[3:17:37.320 --> 3:17:48.320]  Or explain to me I kind of maybe you can help us navigate that I want to be able to put it together where people can get all the stuff that goes together the best from the experts because again I want to get people a good blueprint
[3:17:48.320 --> 3:17:54.320]  This is the best lower how then do we go about building the entire package that's the best
[3:17:54.320 --> 3:18:03.320]  Well actually everything else can go through the US mail system you know I've worked with a lot of companies you know because the the lower is really the only thing that I do
[3:18:03.320 --> 3:18:11.320]  We're manufacturing the lower parts kit now you know I hadn't quite gotten to the my level perfection but when it gets there we'll be releasing that
[3:18:11.320 --> 3:18:16.320]  Sure I mean are there any other companies that you recommend that go good with your systems or is it pretty much just
[3:18:16.320 --> 3:18:26.320]  Absolutely we've been using head down products for probably about three years now always had good luck with them they've been a sponsor they're great guys
[3:18:26.320 --> 3:18:39.320]  Oh absolutely great guys and Sons of Liberty gun works down in San Antonio pretty close to y'all wonderful guys down there yeah great great organization
[3:18:39.320 --> 3:18:47.320]  But those are the ones that we usually work with because you see the innovation in the smaller companies you know the big companies all they want to do is just turn out a product
[3:18:47.320 --> 3:18:51.320]  They don't care they're all owned by big limerits anyway it's the small companies that really care
[3:18:51.320 --> 3:18:58.320]  Yeah no these cold-blooded executives go that's a market pump as much crap out with advertising as we can I'm always like no I don't want to do that
[3:18:58.320 --> 3:19:00.320]  I don't want my audience to get a bunch of crap
[3:19:00.320 --> 3:19:10.320]  Exactly so what we focus on is we don't advertise everything that we do is word of mouth and we pretty much grow and we almost double in size every year
[3:19:10.320 --> 3:19:19.320]  Because people are talking it's not because we're spending tons of money on advertising glitzy and you know glitzy glitzy show girls in the show
[3:19:19.320 --> 3:19:25.320]  Info Wars has never done any advertising other than some stuff on Limbaugh to try to help him when they're trying to shut him off just as an act of war
[3:19:25.320 --> 3:19:33.320]  You don't need it when you have a good product when you have a good product it sells itself so when you got a good product and a good warranty and you know you stand behind it and you're a real
[3:19:33.320 --> 3:19:36.320]  If you're a real person with a real product it sells itself because it's real
[3:19:36.320 --> 3:19:43.320]  And then you're going to be in business with your grandkids in a hundred years it's like don't the it's like people think what we're doing or what you're doing at Tennessee Arms is something new
[3:19:43.320 --> 3:19:52.320]  No it's what America was based on like I want you to buy the stuff we sell over and over again to help us fund the operation it's quality it's it's
[3:19:52.320 --> 3:19:57.320]  I didn't do it some cold-blooded way I was like I want to sell good stuff because that's what I want to be treated
[3:19:57.320 --> 3:20:04.320]  But then everybody loves it so then we get even more business we get bigger all these weirdos think like if you cheat somebody and get some money up front you're winning
[3:20:04.320 --> 3:20:10.320]  I don't understand that it's a loser mentality it's conceited and it's a loser mentality
[3:20:10.320 --> 3:20:17.320]  It's not the way business should be done I mean we we actually track a lot of our customers we keep in touch with them we want to know what they're doing
[3:20:17.320 --> 3:20:23.320]  Well let's just say I don't want to back the rest of the country but everybody's leaving the east coast and the west coast to come to the middle of the country in the south
[3:20:23.320 --> 3:20:30.320]  Not that we're perfect but people are nice they're friendly they want to compliment you they want to ask who you are and they want to treat you good
[3:20:30.320 --> 3:20:33.320]  And liberals now are buying guns and they'll start buying lowers
[3:20:33.320 --> 3:20:35.320]  Yeah what do you make of that?
[3:20:35.320 --> 3:20:43.320]  Well I've heard it I've heard it said that the country's like a loaf of bread you know it's kind of it's kind of hard on the crust and it's soft in the middle
[3:20:43.320 --> 3:20:50.320]  And you know it's a there's a lot of truth to that is you know I've you know went school in Boston you know I've lived on both coast
[3:20:50.320 --> 3:20:55.320]  You know it's a there's there's good people here in the south there's good people in town
[3:20:55.320 --> 3:21:00.320]  Oh there's good people all over the country it's just there's these elites in control of the east and west coast
[3:21:00.320 --> 3:21:06.320]  Oh it's unreal you know and the things that they're ramming down everyone's throat it's just it's not the way things should be done
[3:21:06.320 --> 3:21:12.320]  Freedom works if you let it you know if you if you give people the tools to let them go make their life better they will do it every time
[3:21:12.320 --> 3:21:14.320]  Just stay out of their way
[3:21:14.320 --> 3:21:23.320]  Well Soros jumped the shark with all this cop killing crap and I think that was the final nail trying to run a destabilization program to cause a civil war
[3:21:23.320 --> 3:21:30.320]  That was when the record skipped and anybody that was questioning us said you're right we're taking them down
[3:21:30.320 --> 3:21:36.320]  I know you're busy David Roberts there in Tennessee with Tennessee Arms Co.com
[3:21:36.320 --> 3:21:44.320]  But I mean have you cut have you heard like there's been a whole counter kill against Obama and the globalist and WikiLeaks was actually intelligence agencies in the US
[3:21:44.320 --> 3:21:50.320]  And we just beat them and they've been trying all sorts of stuff behind the scenes but I mean there's some big stuff going on bro
[3:21:50.320 --> 3:21:57.320]  Absolutely and you know it's all moving in the right direction you know it's just the winds of change you know everything has been moving in one direction for
[3:21:57.320 --> 3:22:08.320]  You know basically since the you know Clinton presidency started was you know everything was moving more toward a status in a centralized government and people are just basically fed up with it
[3:22:08.320 --> 3:22:16.320]  You know they want to actually control their own lives they want to take personal responsibility they don't want to be controlled by central government by anybody really
[3:22:16.320 --> 3:22:23.320]  I mean the worst thing you can ever do to somebody that's truly free is to tell them what to do and you know that's one of the things why you know I support your organization
[3:22:23.320 --> 3:22:29.320]  And you know you're you're doing it the right way is you're telling people the truth and you're just letting it disseminate from there
[3:22:29.320 --> 3:22:35.320]  Is you tell people the truth you give them the tools to actually do what they can and they can make noise about it if you don't
[3:22:35.320 --> 3:22:41.320]  If you can't make an informed decision based in truth then everything that you're doing is it's for naught
[3:22:41.320 --> 3:22:46.320]  Absolutely well God bless you David Roberts and thank you for having the best quality lower out there
[3:22:46.320 --> 3:22:55.320]  And thanks for working with them for wars.com and for store.com people get a high quality lower they felt funder operation they support you in Tennessee and America
[3:22:55.320 --> 3:23:01.320]  Thank you so much sir. Thank you and have a great day. Thank you. All right I want to hand this over to David Knight who just got back from vacation
[3:23:01.320 --> 3:23:08.320]  I know he's chomping at the bit and I guess he's hosting the nightly news tonight as well but so much coming up. I just want to say this here
[3:23:08.320 --> 3:23:17.320]  Because I've gotten really excited today looking at the facts looking at what the globe was to try and watching what the newspapers are doing knowing who's who
[3:23:17.320 --> 3:23:24.320]  Who's got operatives where it takes a lot of research to do what I do. I'm not bragging but it's like mind-burning to like know the enemies know they are
[3:23:24.320 --> 3:23:31.320]  Know where they're at to where it's like you can't even try to even say it. It's like you hold this big map in your brain and then you just make a prime projection
[3:23:31.320 --> 3:23:39.320]  Explain that it's like a whole battlefield and then we'll just have no each piece of it and then make a decision and that's what I do
[3:23:39.320 --> 3:23:46.320]  And then that's the idiot savant gift I've got why I do like it like a lot of intelligence operatives and high-level people want to hear what I have to say
[3:23:46.320 --> 3:23:52.320]  Not to some pat on the head they really want to war game it with me and I'm telling you we're in the crossroads right now but we're pulling out
[3:23:52.320 --> 3:24:00.320]  Obama's losing support Hillary's losing support Soros is losing support their own media is turning against them because they know WikiLeaks is about to drop
[3:24:00.320 --> 3:24:08.320]  Stuff 10 times worse and we don't want to do this okay this I say let everything out but I mean this stuff's so bad folks that we're gonna have to
[3:24:08.320 --> 3:24:15.320]  Rest like 10,000 people and like execute them if this comes out and then they're gonna fight they got kill switches and we put them into sabotage mode
[3:24:15.320 --> 3:24:20.320]  There's a reason we kept putting Napoleon on an island instead of killing because he'd have flipped the switch to cause you know
[3:24:20.320 --> 3:24:30.320]  So we don't want it so we want to cover up evil this stuff so bad folks these people are so evil that they've got a kill switch okay and like people told me
[3:24:30.320 --> 3:24:37.320]  So many high-level people that say listen always we can't tell you class fuck stuff get this guy on he figured it out this piece that piece and then I go talk to the guy and they go
[3:24:37.320 --> 3:24:45.320]  Yeah, Soros has got an economic kill switch that's ready to bring down the economy so they're now saying Trump's gonna implode the economy Alex Jones it's his fault they're looking at that right now
[3:24:45.320 --> 3:24:54.320]  But there's a bunch of people going you do that you're gonna be pushing up daisies and not just politically so everybody understand something this is
[3:24:54.320 --> 3:25:01.320]  This is more epic than our founding okay I mean I mean just let me tell you something what's going on right now is the most epic moment in world history
[3:25:01.320 --> 3:25:07.320]  Because this isn't just about America the whole world is struggling out of globalist clutches right now they always said new order doesn't exist
[3:25:07.320 --> 3:25:13.320]  Soros doesn't exist Davos doesn't exist Bilderberg doesn't exist planetary government doesn't exist carbon tax doesn't exist
[3:25:13.320 --> 3:25:19.320]  So we'd never actually fight them but people said no it does exist we're gonna fight they're folding because they're so small
[3:25:19.320 --> 3:25:31.320]  They're a bunch of inbred crazy scumbags and the epic moment is now and so we're here and the battle's gonna go on there's no utopia it's a continuum but a very nasty crop
[3:25:31.320 --> 3:25:40.320]  Of delusional crazies is on its deathbed now this is the most critical 16 days of our life and probably for generations
[3:25:40.320 --> 3:25:48.320]  David Knight talks a lot about the fourth turning and a super cycle so did Matt Bracken yesterday I agree we're at that super turning right now
[3:25:48.320 --> 3:25:55.320]  David Knight can you feel it in your gut can you intellectually see it I mean the electricity is alive but just the last few hours
[3:25:55.320 --> 3:26:04.320]  I hate to do this this mumbo jumbo but it's not my gut just told me a huge cloud just lifted because there's a big battle going on behind the scenes
[3:26:04.320 --> 3:26:11.320]  I can't get into all of it a huge clouds lifting I believe they may have just surrendered I believe we may have just seen the enemy surrender today
[3:26:11.320 --> 3:26:16.320]  I know the gauntlet was put down yesterday I know it was being put down again today and I believe the enemy just surrendered
[3:26:16.320 --> 3:26:22.320]  I felt I don't mean to get mumbo jumbo but it's real we all have six cents like you all know when your grandma I called my dad one night
[3:26:22.320 --> 3:26:28.320]  I said I just feel like we should go see me mom she was fine out of the hospital for months doing good and I said I think she's gonna die
[3:26:28.320 --> 3:26:35.320]  he said you're right let's go and I was on coast to coast a.m. that night went to bed at four and my dad came at like 6 a.m. to drive the ranch
[3:26:35.320 --> 3:26:42.320]  and he said get up and I said I wouldn't gotten them I don't usually take a bath kind of like lazy to take a bath let me wake up dad
[3:26:42.320 --> 3:26:46.320]  because I've been up on coast to coast a and probably drank a six pack of beer to stay up that's what he used for stimulant
[3:26:46.320 --> 3:26:51.320]  beer works like that on me is a stimulant on a depressant and I remember it was a drinker so I started to shake it up all night
[3:26:51.320 --> 3:27:01.320]  and working and he goes all right fine he leaves it like 7 30 and and I left right behind him in about an hour before he calls on the cell phone
[3:27:01.320 --> 3:27:12.320]  and he goes I'm pulling up now she just died so he went there was up because of me like it up but the point is I knew she was gonna die
[3:27:12.320 --> 3:27:20.320]  and I wasn't there and but the point is I knew so there's a six cents and I can tell you right now the enemy is collapsing as we speak
[3:27:20.320 --> 3:27:29.320]  it's a big moment for America probably we'll see it in our lifetime skin and they still might come from behind but I'm telling you the enemy is falling right now
[3:27:29.320 --> 3:27:40.320]  this is a big time folks this is like the new July 4th whatever day this is well just January 3rd I'm telling you right now I think the enemy's broken
[3:27:40.320 --> 3:27:46.320]  I can feel it it's like it's like you can feel the energy lowering I think they've given up David Knight I don't mean to get involved in this intense stuff go ahead
[3:27:46.320 --> 3:27:57.320]  yeah you know Alex when you were talking to Steve Picinic and he was pointing out what was happening he said the New York Times even is talking now about Obama and how he persecuted journalists
[3:27:57.320 --> 3:28:05.320]  this is something we've been talking about for a very long time maybe before Christmas I mentioned it yet again about how Obama has put more people
[3:28:05.320 --> 3:28:16.320]  journalists and whistleblowers persecuted them prosecuted them under the espionage act of 1917 then all of the presidents in the last 100 years combined
[3:28:16.320 --> 3:28:23.320]  and so people understand this and you look at this graphic this on the New York Times they've got a whistle with an Obama symbol on the round part
[3:28:23.320 --> 3:28:30.320]  and on the part that you stick in your mouth to blow they've got spikes all over it and so even the New York Times is pulling back
[3:28:30.320 --> 3:28:36.320]  but the thing that really stuck out to me Alex over the weekend were these couple of stories about the Washington Post
[3:28:36.320 --> 3:28:45.320]  and of course we had Mikhail Thelen on it right away saying they're saying that the Russians have taken over and hacked our power grid
[3:28:45.320 --> 3:28:53.320]  but let's take a look at what really happened it was on it was just a virus that was on one laptop that wasn't even attached to the power grid up in Vermont
[3:28:53.320 --> 3:29:00.320]  and so that was the reality we exposed that right away we have another story up on Infowars now from RT breaking that down in addition
[3:29:00.320 --> 3:29:08.320]  but then at the same time Alex we had the editor from the Washington Post go on Face the Nation or maybe we should call it Two-Face the Nation
[3:29:08.320 --> 3:29:16.320]  because that's what they are they're Two-Faced telling these lies with other people of course he had David Frum who is this never-Trumper
[3:29:16.320 --> 3:29:24.320]  the part of the Bush-Neocon establishment always pushing for war pushing the Russian agenda again and they were wringing their hands about
[3:29:24.320 --> 3:29:30.320]  how Donald Trump had put in all of these businessmen and generals who they said didn't have any political experience and you know what
[3:29:30.320 --> 3:29:36.320]  it's not a problem if we have a general like Eisenhower or like George Washington
[3:29:36.320 --> 3:29:46.320]  back to America David take over that's right job of the crew hey we're not out of the woods yet but I'm telling the tides turning because they know we're not bluffing they know we've got the intel it'll bring them down no matter what they do
[3:29:46.320 --> 3:29:50.320]  firing a nuclear war the globalists are done and that'll end them as well
[3:29:50.320 --> 3:30:07.320]  we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network well once again Julian Assange has come out and said that Russia was not the source of the John Podesta and DNC email leaks
[3:30:07.320 --> 3:30:16.320]  in an interview on Hannity Assange assured Hannity and the audience that the source of the emails was not Russian or a state party this comes on the heels of the Obama administration
[3:30:16.320 --> 3:30:22.320]  and the liberal minions digging their heels in on the Russian hacking allegations with fake news such as Russia hacked the election
[3:30:22.320 --> 3:30:30.320]  Assange makes the keen observation that in the statement made by five different branches of the US government against the 35 Russian diplomats that were removed from the US
[3:30:30.320 --> 3:30:39.320]  WikiLeaks was not referenced once back on November 9th Obama assured President-elect Trump and the American people that he would do everything possible to make this a smooth transition
[3:30:39.320 --> 3:30:48.320]  someone is lying so I want to be honest it's not as if it's just Republicans who have monkeyed around with elections in the past sometimes Democrats have to
[3:30:48.320 --> 3:31:10.320]  of course the elections will not be right what does that mean this is Owen Shroyer for Infowars and there's a war on for your mind
[3:31:10.320 --> 3:31:19.320]  millions of dollars in health care nearly $10,000 per man woman and child in this country obesity diabetes cancer heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant
[3:31:19.320 --> 3:31:26.320]  one out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease

[3:32:09.320 --> 3:32:23.320]  and these enemies of free speech are out there telling us don't say Merry Christmas in fact don't even say holidays while I got news for them just because of them doing that I'm going to extend our Christmas sales right through into 2017

[3:33:24.320 --> 3:33:34.320]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host on this fourth hour it's good to be back and I was always talking to Alex and looked at the news of the weekend it was absolutely amazing
[3:33:34.320 --> 3:33:48.320]  to see that at the same time the Washington Post was selling this irresponsible lie about the Russians hacking our power supply they were also our power grid they were also going on face the nation
[3:33:48.320 --> 3:34:04.320]  and talking about how dangerous info wars and Donald Trump were truly amazing and of course as I mentioned David from the Bush neocon who never saw a war that he didn't support ringing their hands about the fact that
[3:34:04.320 --> 3:34:12.320]  Donald Trump has appointed some generals as I point out in the last segment you know we've had some good generals as president we've had George Washington we've had Andrew Jackson
[3:34:12.320 --> 3:34:25.320]  we had Eisenhower who warned us about the military industrial complex did more to stop it than any of the civilian people that we've had since then because we've seen the military industrial complex advancing
[3:34:25.320 --> 3:34:38.320]  and the same people these neocons who have supported setting the Middle East on fire so they can bring in a mass exodus of people who do not want to be a part of our culture we're going to talk about that in a moment
[3:34:38.320 --> 3:34:51.320]  the same people who have supported the militarization of the police and the centralization of all police control out of Washington these same people are talking about how it's awful that Donald Trump has generals there
[3:34:51.320 --> 3:35:03.320]  but I want to take a look at some of the details of what they said because it was very interesting what the Washington Post editor said as well as Michelle Norris of the race card project
[3:35:03.320 --> 3:35:14.320]  I couldn't believe that's what she called I don't know what the race card project is but that's basically what they're playing all the time and after I talk about this I also want to talk about what happened today with draining the swamp
[3:35:14.320 --> 3:35:28.320]  I think Donald Trump made a huge step towards draining the swamp today I was very happy to see what happened we're also going to talk about how the Muslims rang in the new year from Turkey throughout Europe as well
[3:35:28.320 --> 3:35:41.320]  but real quickly I want to go back to this story about the Washington Post editor who is complaining about the fact that Donald Trump will be on message he says for seven days and all of a sudden in the middle of the night he reads info wars
[3:35:41.320 --> 3:35:49.320]  and he tweets some stuff out that he says can tank markets and invite incursions what was the Washington Post doing at the same time
[3:35:49.320 --> 3:36:01.320]  they were trying to start a war with Russia saying that we've got them hacking our power grid underscoring the phony narrative that they've been pushing for Obama all of this time
[3:36:01.320 --> 3:36:12.320]  that the Russians have been doing everything saying we need to have sanctions we need to take some actions this is the irresponsible behavior of the Washington Post at the same time they're complaining about info wars
[3:36:12.320 --> 3:36:26.320]  and of course at that time we were exposing it we had a great story right away from Mikhail Phelan at info wars then we had this one from the race card project talking about how bad it was that they didn't have control of the media
[3:36:26.320 --> 3:36:34.320]  and I want to read you this quote that she said she says as journalists we have to learn how to operate in a world where there is no longer a common set of facts
[3:36:34.320 --> 3:36:46.320]  think about that what she's saying she's not really saying that you've got your facts I've got my facts no there's one set of facts folks people can have opinions and we can argue about that in the free market of ideas
[3:36:46.320 --> 3:36:57.320]  but see they didn't have a free market of ideas I grew up in a time we had ABC CBS NBC and NPR and that was it and they were all reading off of a government script
[3:36:57.320 --> 3:37:07.320]  they all covered the same stories they all had the same take on the same stories they never questioned the government's official story never questioned it no matter how absurd it was
[3:37:07.320 --> 3:37:24.320]  if you questioned it if you questioned the magic bullet that killed JFK then you were a conspiracy theorist that's where that came from that was to shut down any questioning of the common set of facts that were coming out of our common government propaganda
[3:37:24.320 --> 3:37:32.320]  so that's what they don't like they don't like the fact that they don't control the agenda that's what she's talking about when she says there's no more common facts
[3:37:32.320 --> 3:37:42.320]  then she goes on says people get their news in such a way that it usually affirms or confirms everything they already believe now the phrase for that is a confirmation bias
[3:37:42.320 --> 3:37:54.320]  so they say you've got a bias and you're going to be drawn to news that confirms your bias and I would say well what about your bias what about the bias of the race card project
[3:37:54.320 --> 3:38:06.320]  what about the bias of the Washington Post of the New York Times you see they have a bias as well there's two types of people those who acknowledge their bias and those who don't
[3:38:06.320 --> 3:38:17.320]  and they are deceiving either themselves or you when they don't acknowledge their bias their bias in terms of what they even choose to report on that reflects your own personal bias
[3:38:17.320 --> 3:38:30.320]  what you think is important what you don't think is important what you agree with what you totally reject out of hand and I'm telling you we are better positioned at Infowars to fight the Washington Post in the New York Times
[3:38:30.320 --> 3:38:42.320]  because they have existed in an environment for a very long time where no one questioned their pronouncements no matter how blatantly naked the Emperor was nobody ever said he doesn't have any clothes
[3:38:42.320 --> 3:38:55.320]  we were over here saying he's got no clothes and here's why look there's this there's this there's this and we use their own sources and we footnoted our own information because we knew that it was something that was different from what you were hearing
[3:38:55.320 --> 3:39:10.320]  we knew it was going to be criticized as a conspiracy theory or as a tinfoil hat idea so we documented it so we're ready for this we've been doing this for a long time and we've been going against the mainstream media's fake news for a very long time
[3:39:10.320 --> 3:39:24.320]  and documenting why it is fake so we're loaded for bear we're ready for this battle we're ready for this info war then they go on to say the bad news as she says somebody is about to occupy the Oval Office who is trying to bypass us
[3:39:24.320 --> 3:39:38.320]  the mainstream media and go directly to the public oh my oh my isn't that horrible that's exactly what is going to happen so let's take a look at what happened today because we get all this back and forth
[3:39:38.320 --> 3:39:46.320]  is Trump for real is Trump going to drain the swamp is it going to stand up to the corruption what was the very first thing that the Republicans did today
[3:39:46.320 --> 3:40:00.320]  well the Republicans as Washington Post points out in their first full day of power in 2017 what was their first order of business House Republicans came close to gutting an independent ethics committee
[3:40:00.320 --> 3:40:12.320]  one that was set up in the wake of scandals that arguably cost them power a decade ago and so the first thing they did was not to cut taxes not to cut regulations not to get rid of the Obamacare mandates
[3:40:12.320 --> 3:40:24.320]  their first act was let's get rid of the independent ethics panel that was Republicans and of course Nancy Pelosi gloated about that said so much for draining the swamp she tweeted out
[3:40:24.320 --> 3:40:36.320]  but Donald Trump came back and said with all that Congress has to work on do they really have to make the weakening of the independent ethics watchdog as unfair it is as it may be their number one act in priority
[3:40:36.320 --> 3:40:52.320]  focus on tax reform on health care on so many other things of far greater importance and I gotta say for Nancy Pelosi to come out here and say so much for draining the swamp the chief alligator who's been swimming around that swamp forever
[3:40:52.320 --> 3:41:10.320]  and we're gonna talk about here I want to remind you of Nancy Pelosi's ethics issues okay it's not just the Republicans yes they're in there as well as a bipartisan swamp and the good thing about it was that Donald Trump came out with that slam them on that issue
[3:41:10.320 --> 3:41:24.320]  and as the hill points out the GOP had an emergency meeting because Donald Trump complained about it and they withdrew that proposal after their emergency meeting this is very good news
[3:41:24.320 --> 3:41:36.320]  this is the very first thing that we've seen Donald Trump going against the Republicans and say no we're gonna drain the swamp we're not going to let you put off the real business of government the real things that we have said
[3:41:36.320 --> 3:41:56.320]  we were going to do as we got elected as conservatives or libertarians no you're gonna cut the ethics oversight that's your first order of business absolutely amazing but I want you to remember what Nancy Pelosi and Obama did when confronted with this
[3:41:56.320 --> 3:42:10.320]  but let's remember where this all started and of course going back again to this Washington post article they say well what is the office of congressional ethics it's an independent body it's the first independent body that they've created that oversees and investigates ethics
[3:42:10.320 --> 3:42:26.320]  and I have four Republicans four Democrats none of them can be current members of Congress they cannot be employees of the federal government they're trying to get some independence here a little bit okay a lot of it is just you know a mask and we'll show you why this is a mask
[3:42:26.320 --> 3:42:40.320]  because they talk about increasing transparency and providing information to the public we're gonna tell you what really happens with that but even this beard over their ethical problems the Republicans wanted to get rid of today and this all goes back to the time that
[3:42:40.320 --> 3:42:57.320]  Jack Abramoff was in Congress and the corruption that we had there under the House Speaker and pedophile Dennis Hastert and as Washington Post goes and they talk about Republican problems of course because they're very partisan they talk about Tom delay they talk about the Abramoff
[3:42:57.320 --> 3:43:12.320]  lobbying scandal under Hastert they talk about Mark Foley who had to resign amidst allegations that he had sent sexually explicit messages to congressional pages as well as other bribery scandals but then there was also some things with Democrats
[3:43:12.320 --> 3:43:27.320]  we had Alan Grayson who was caught by this ethics office they said he may have improperly used his house house office to handle a family run hedge fund there were 10 lawmakers some of their spouses took all expenses paid trips to the Caspian Sea in 2013
[3:43:27.320 --> 3:43:43.320]  secretly funded by a state owned oil company of Azure by John you know what about all these congressmen that get junkets to Turkey paid for by Fatala Gulen's organization no investigation of that so they're very selective about what they want to look at
[3:43:43.320 --> 3:43:58.320]  they're also selective about the partisan aspects of it but let's go back to 2011 and let's remember what happened then we had Nancy Pelosi and a 60 minutes investigation and this is information that had been given to them by the Hoover
[3:43:58.320 --> 3:44:16.320]  Institute this is a conservative organization they'd done some investigation they gave it to Steve Croft with 60 minutes and in 2011 November 2011 he had a very pointed exchange with Nancy Pelosi and at that time people realize that Nancy Pelosi and her husband
[3:44:16.320 --> 3:44:33.320]  had participated in at least eight IPOs that's initial public offerings that's where you take a private company public and usually the owners make a killing off of the the increase in stock anybody who is able to get in on that IPO before it hits the
[3:44:33.320 --> 3:44:47.320]  trading floor usually makes a fortune and so they were able to participate in at least eight IPOs and they had access to information that was directly relating to the companies involved the point is is that if they had been a private party
[3:44:47.320 --> 3:45:07.320]  they would have been hit with massive prison sentences and fines you know kind like Hillary Clinton would have been would have gone to prison for email security violations if she had been anybody other than Hillary Clinton but this is what the people we learned after this came out with Nancy Pelosi
[3:45:07.320 --> 3:45:24.320]  and her husband we learned that there was no rule that Congress couldn't get engaged in insider trading now remember we had some very high profile cases of people going to jail for very minor violations of insider trading is something that the SEC watches
[3:45:24.320 --> 3:45:40.320]  like a hawk and sends celebrities to prison on a regular basis but not Congress so this became a very big scandal and in response they passed something called the stock act stop trading on Congressional Knowledge Act I love how they come up with these
[3:45:40.320 --> 3:45:55.320]  hokey acronyms they always do this and the interesting thing was they enacted this to cover up the scandal they said alright alright yeah Nancy Pelosi and her husband made a fortune doing insider trading but it wasn't against the rules
[3:45:55.320 --> 3:46:10.320]  because we exempted ourselves from those rules you see and so then what they did was I said we'll fix it we'll fix it we're going to make sure that doesn't happen we're going to create this stock act so they do that in April of two thousand they do that in two thousand eleven
[3:46:10.320 --> 3:46:28.320]  and then in April of two thousand thirteen they modify it in other words they eviscerated it when nobody was looking so they waited about eight or nine months and after making a big fanfare about how they're going to fix the insider trading that is engaged on by members of Congress
[3:46:28.320 --> 3:46:44.320]  then they come back on April of fifteen two thousand eleven they introduced a bill from Harry Reid of all people and he put this to the Senate they passed it by unanimous consent it got fourteen seconds of consideration before being passed by unanimous consent
[3:46:44.320 --> 3:46:59.320]  and what did they do with that well they removed the creation of searchable sortable disclosure of the information so much for transparency for the public right no you're not going to be allowed to see what they do and this is something I'm taking from opensecrets.org
[3:46:59.320 --> 3:47:14.320]  going back to April fifteenth two thousand thirteen an action alert say look the stock act was just reversed and it was signed by Obama okay he had no problem signing that so they took away the requirement of electronic filing for Congress
[3:47:14.320 --> 3:47:31.320]  that took away the requirement of filing by the president or the vice president or the president's cabinet or congressional candidates as well as high level executive and congressional branch employees in other words all of these people in government don't have to file and they can still engage in insider trading
[3:47:31.320 --> 3:47:46.320]  so they came out with a beard piece of legislation they waited about eight or nine months and then they repealed it quietly with fourteen seconds of deliberation and did it unanimously by voice consent and then Obama quietly signed it into law
[3:47:46.320 --> 3:48:03.320]  now I want you to compare that to the feigned hand wringing by Nancy Pelosi about the fact that the Republicans as their first order business decide they wanted to get rid of ethics oversight committee the independent ethics oversight committee and I want you to look at what
[3:48:03.320 --> 3:48:21.320]  Donald Trump did he didn't quietly go along with this he didn't sign this in the middle of the night like Obama did instead he took to Twitter and he called him out on it and he made them meet an emergency meeting to try to do damage control
[3:48:21.320 --> 3:48:39.320]  this is a very very positive sign we keep getting more and more positive signs and of course we see all these situations of people businesses saying we're going to not build that one point six billion dollar automobile factory Ford said that down in Mexico instead we're going to build a seven hundred million
[3:48:39.320 --> 3:48:54.320]  dollar factory in the United States all that is great news we've seen a lot of great news we've seen a lot of great optimism I'm not telling you right now when Obama starts talking about his record four years from now and the Democrats start talking about that
[3:48:54.320 --> 3:49:13.320]  they're going to look at when Obama took office in 2009 and they're going to say look at how bad things were after the Federal Reserve engineered a burst of the economic balloon that they had created and then look at how wonderful things were just before Obama left office
[3:49:13.320 --> 3:49:29.320]  and they're going to ignore the fact deliberately that this stock market this raging stock market is a reaction to Donald Trump becoming president and the optimism about Donald Trump's presidency and nothing that Barack Obama did but I'm telling you right now
[3:49:29.320 --> 3:49:47.320]  we can write this down come back to this four years from now when they're running or you know actually to be a little bit less than four years they're going to pretend that Barack Obama did all of this stuff that is happening with Donald Trump all the stuff that happened with the stock market
[3:49:47.320 --> 3:50:02.320]  and everything else and of course we know that the system is working overtime to try to burst the bubble that they've been creating in terms of low interest rates they've announced already one interest rate increase and another three next year
[3:50:02.320 --> 3:50:12.320]  so they're going to try to burst this but just remember where this is coming from because we're going to have to fight that battle in about three years when they start running for president again
[3:50:12.320 --> 3:50:22.320]  I want to take a look at what the Muslims did over New Year's Eve you know we had this Istanbul attack where a guy came in dressed as Santa Claus on New Year's Eve
[3:50:22.320 --> 3:50:35.320]  we're looking at this and my wife and I are Santa Claus on New Year's Eve and they're saying they're fighting against a Christian holiday and we're like they don't even understand the culture that they hate so much
[3:50:35.320 --> 3:50:45.320]  and I'm going to tell you why they hate this culture so much I'm going to tell you what happened in Cologne I'm going to tell you what happened at Germany's oldest church in Dortmund
[3:50:45.320 --> 3:50:52.320]  this is a story that the Germans still aren't talking about just like last year they didn't want to talk about what happened in Cologne on New Year's Eve
[3:50:52.320 --> 3:51:07.320]  I'm going to tell you about both of those when we come back stay with us.

[3:54:13.320 --> 3:54:21.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight and I want to talk about how the Muslims celebrated New Year's throughout Europe and Turkey over the weekend of course.
[3:54:21.320 --> 3:54:36.320]  Back in Istanbul the shooting there done by a man dressed as Santa Claus saying he was coming after a Christian holiday and as I was starting to say in the last segment you know I thought of it I never thought of New Year's as being a Christian holiday but then I looked it up and it's like
[3:54:36.320 --> 3:54:52.320]  yeah the Muslims have a different calendar. See their first year is what we would call 622 year of our Lord. Okay so that was the year that was a year of significance for something that Muhammad did and that's where they began their first year.
[3:54:52.320 --> 3:55:08.320]  So for them when we say that this is 2017 and we try to date that as close as we can to the birth of Christ our Lord then that is an offense to them and so they take that as a cue as a reason to go slaughter people in the streets
[3:55:08.320 --> 3:55:23.320]  because if they don't agree with your religion then that's what they do and the subtitle of this article that we have up at Infowars talking about looking back at Cologne where we had a large attack on New Year's Eve last year that was covered up by the Cologne police for several months.
[3:55:23.320 --> 3:55:38.320]  We look at this and the subtitle was Germany continues its terrifying descent into multicultural hell and I gotta say this is not going to be a multicultural hell just for Christians. It's gonna be a hell for Christians. It's gonna be hell for atheists. It's gonna be a hell for feminists.
[3:55:38.320 --> 3:55:48.320]  It's gonna be a hell for LGBT. It's gonna be a hell for anybody who doesn't toe their cult of death because that's what it is. It's a sacrament of death.
[3:55:48.320 --> 3:56:02.320]  And as I looked at some of these things, my wife and I were talking about this and of course she was at the event where we were protesting the abortion clinic and the people came up to my wife and said I kill my kids.
[3:56:02.320 --> 3:56:17.320]  They bragged about that. And as we were talking about this, I said that is the commonality between the Democrat left and the Muslims because they hate feminists, they hate LGBT, which the Democrats say they love these groups.
[3:56:17.320 --> 3:56:36.320]  And yet the only common ground that I can discern is that they're both cults of death. The Democrats view abortion as a sacrament and the Muslims see their ability to strike back against our culture, especially in the expression of the Christian religion as a sacrament as well.
[3:56:36.320 --> 3:56:52.320]  This story at InfoWars talks about how the police in Cologne are still pandering in a servile manner to these thugs who attacked everybody last year. They tweeted out in Arabic a warm welcome to New Year's Eve 2016 in Cologne.
[3:56:52.320 --> 3:57:08.320]  They said no other time in recent months have they ever tweeted in Arabic. Now to remind you, the article says in Cologne there was a site of 1,300 crimes during the New Year's Eve celebration one year ago, including 650 sexual assaults and 28 rapes.
[3:57:08.320 --> 3:57:14.320]  How's that for protecting women? You want to say you're about protecting women? Hillary? Democrats?
[3:57:14.320 --> 3:57:24.320]  The vast majority of these offenses were carried out by migrant men of Arab and African origin as video footage and eyewitness accounts revealed of the few suspects identified by police at the time.
[3:57:24.320 --> 3:57:40.320]  More than half were asylum seekers. Now what happened this year? We had a 1,000 man mob attack Germany's oldest church in Dortmund, Germany, and they were shouting Allah Akbar as they set the church on fire.
[3:57:40.320 --> 3:57:53.320]  This began at 7pm. A man was hospitalized, a homeless man, and group of homeless people. One man got a first degree burn to his face after they were shooting and throwing fireworks at homeless people.
[3:57:53.320 --> 3:57:59.320]  That's how these guys began their celebration. Because they have to attack the homeless.
[3:57:59.320 --> 3:58:12.320]  And they said at least 1,000 young men began throwing fireworks under crowded visitors, which also included families with children asked by officers to stop the mob turned to pelting fireworks at the police instead.
[3:58:12.320 --> 3:58:24.320]  See, this is the way this is going to go down. When you look at what we're offering here, what Alex is talking about, that's what I kept thinking about is I was looking at these articles I had about New Year's Eve.
[3:58:24.320 --> 3:58:35.320]  If you're not going to protect yourself, you are going to be at the mercy of these people. If they want to divorce themselves from the Nazis, why don't they start with repealing the Nazi gun control acts?
[3:58:35.320 --> 3:58:40.320]  That would be a first thing the Germans should do. Join us tonight for the Info Wars Nightly News.
