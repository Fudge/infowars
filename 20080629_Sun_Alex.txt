[00:00.000 --> 00:04.160]  It goes, Mayor says today's Supreme Court ruling that eliminates a handgun ban in Washington,
[00:04.160 --> 00:08.720]  D.C. flies in the face of reality, but a constitutional law professor predicts it will now be open

[01:59.080 --> 02:01.560]  will likely speak directly within the next few days.
[02:01.560 --> 02:04.840]  That prediction comes from Terry McAuliffe, who served as chairman of Hillary Clinton's
[02:04.840 --> 02:08.280]  presidential run and his past chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
[02:08.280 --> 02:12.920]  He told CNN's light edition the former president will support Obama's White House run.
[02:12.920 --> 02:14.920]  He is raring to go.
[02:14.920 --> 02:15.920]  I spoke to him today.
[02:15.920 --> 02:16.920]  He's ready to go.

[02:58.440 --> 03:01.400]  years, and I do this from the middle of a cornfield.

[03:29.000 --> 03:33.440]  Officials say Pakistani paramilitary forces destroyed a handful of militant centers as
[03:33.440 --> 03:38.040]  they pressed ahead with an offensive against extremists near the Afghan border.
[03:38.040 --> 03:42.240]  Even though California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn't agree with all of John McCain's energy
[03:42.240 --> 03:44.640]  proposals, he's standing by him.
[03:44.640 --> 03:49.120]  Appearing on NBC's Meet the Press, Schwarzenegger says the presumptive Republican presidential
[03:49.120 --> 03:52.360]  nominee is the real deal on the environment.
[03:52.360 --> 03:54.240]  He is terrific with the environment.
[03:54.240 --> 03:58.520]  He has been there four years ago and stood by my side when I talked about the environment,

[04:13.680 --> 04:17.480]  The proposed deal also needs the approval of the Lebanese militant group's secretive
[04:17.480 --> 04:18.960]  decision-making council.
[04:18.960 --> 04:22.360]  The agreement had sparked a fierce public debate over whether Israel would be giving
[04:22.360 --> 04:26.720]  up too much or is carrying out its commitment to do everything it can to bring home soldiers
[04:26.720 --> 04:28.440]  who'd fallen into enemy hands.
[04:28.440 --> 04:34.080]  The deal would have Hezbollah return two soldiers it captured in a July 2006 cross-border raid
[04:34.080 --> 04:36.440]  that sparked a 34-day war.
[04:36.440 --> 04:41.880]  Israel would release Samir Kantar, who's serving multiple life terms for a 1979 attack in which

[04:46.400 --> 04:49.360]  after being struck in the head with a rifle butt.

[04:53.680 --> 04:58.720]  With oil at $105 per barrel and counting, we need radical change if we're to avert becoming
[04:58.720 --> 05:00.360]  a third-world nation.
[05:00.360 --> 05:04.560]  It's time to jump on the next wave of free energy and radical natural alternative health
[05:04.560 --> 05:05.560]  solutions.
[05:05.560 --> 05:07.720]  Introducing Orgon Products.
[05:07.720 --> 05:12.040]  Orgon is the universal life force, the basic building block of all matter on the material
[05:12.040 --> 05:13.040]  planet.
[05:13.040 --> 05:17.240]  Orgon Electromedicine is the wave of the future dating back to the late 1800s.
[05:17.240 --> 05:21.920]  Will Helmreich Orgon use cloudbuster technology that can now be applied in your home for dramatic
[05:21.920 --> 05:24.480]  energy savings of up to 25 percent?

[05:32.200 --> 05:34.080]  end of all your problems.
[05:34.080 --> 05:36.720]  Health doesn't need to be expensive or complicated.

[06:09.920 --> 06:39.760]  This is a message from the New World Order, to those of you who want to know more, please
[06:39.760 --> 06:44.000]  be aware of your existence.
[06:44.000 --> 06:52.560]  Those of you who have chosen to resist us, the final war is approaching.
[06:52.560 --> 06:56.360]  This is your last chance to join us.
[06:56.360 --> 06:59.240]  You must accept that you are not the majority.
[06:59.240 --> 07:04.600]  Your numbers are not growing.
[07:04.600 --> 07:10.520]  Your efforts to expose our methods have gone unnoticed and buried.
[07:10.520 --> 07:13.720]  Your brothers and sisters are not awake.
[07:13.720 --> 07:17.720]  Your children will not rise up.
[07:17.720 --> 07:27.880]  They will remain unaware of our presence and live lives of no significance.
[07:27.880 --> 07:32.480]  You must thank us for giving them this blessing.
[07:32.480 --> 07:37.240]  We have clouded their eyes by design.
[07:37.240 --> 07:44.640]  Even your leaders, those you look to for inspiration and direction, know fully well of their impending
[07:44.640 --> 07:47.140]  defeat.
[07:47.140 --> 07:51.440]  They see the fate that awaits their movement.
[07:51.440 --> 07:58.200]  They cannot rise above the full force of our manipulation and control of the government,
[07:58.200 --> 08:03.200]  of the media, of the economy, of the armies.
[08:03.200 --> 08:14.200]  Those who will uphold our new laws are being prepared all around you.
[08:14.200 --> 08:19.200]  Alex Jones, the Fourth of July is approaching.
[08:19.200 --> 08:24.200]  You have already slowed our judder-knot machine.
[08:24.200 --> 08:28.200]  You have made your point.
[08:28.200 --> 08:33.200]  You are beginning to become a nuisance.
[08:33.200 --> 08:36.200]  Lay down your arms.
[08:36.200 --> 08:39.200]  Silence your flock of sheep.
[08:39.200 --> 08:43.200]  You are leading them to a slaughter.
[08:43.200 --> 08:48.200]  Do not force our hand on Independence Day.
[08:48.200 --> 08:53.200]  Those who cling to the Old World must accept what is coming.
[08:53.200 --> 09:01.200]  On July 4th, the truth must not rise.
[09:15.200 --> 09:18.200]  All right, my friends, we are live.
[09:18.200 --> 09:23.200]  It is Sunday, the 29th day of June, 2008.
[09:23.200 --> 09:28.200]  We'll be here for the next hour and 50-plus minutes, and we're going to have open phones
[09:28.200 --> 09:32.200]  coming up in the second hour today.
[09:32.200 --> 09:35.200]  You can get lined up now if you'd like, but we'll be going to your calls at the end of this hour,
[09:35.200 --> 09:38.200]  but guaranteed by the start of the next hour.
[09:38.200 --> 09:41.200]  No guest today because there's a lot of news and information I want to cover.
[09:41.200 --> 09:48.200]  That is a fan-made trailer for my new film, Truth Rising, that comes out July 4th on DVD,
[09:48.200 --> 09:52.200]  available at infowars.com, and stores here and there across the country,
[09:52.200 --> 09:57.200]  as well as instant download in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[09:57.200 --> 09:59.200]  That is a fan-made video.
[09:59.200 --> 10:01.200]  I will send that video.
[10:01.200 --> 10:04.200]  I guess it was Friday night I saw it.
[10:04.200 --> 10:08.200]  Somebody made it on YouTube, and it was sent to my inbox,
[10:08.200 --> 10:13.200]  and then I sent it to my webguest, said, post this, and we made the point that it was probably a joke.
[10:13.200 --> 10:15.200]  I mean, obviously a joke.
[10:15.200 --> 10:18.200]  It's meant to get you thinking, to realize that there is a global elite,
[10:18.200 --> 10:22.200]  that they are carrying out tyranny, and that a lot of people are having big debates on YouTube
[10:22.200 --> 10:25.200]  and my own website, infowars.com, about whether it's real or not.
[10:25.200 --> 10:30.200]  When we're telling you, it's obviously not a real message from the New World Order to us.
[10:30.200 --> 10:33.200]  It is a point that we are making.
[10:33.200 --> 10:35.200]  It's to get people thinking.
[10:35.200 --> 10:41.200]  My God, it's doing that. Tens of thousands of people have watched it just since we posted it last night.
[10:41.200 --> 10:47.200]  Okay, folks, you can watch the video that goes along with the audio you just heard at infowars.com
[10:47.200 --> 10:50.200]  and prisonplanet.com right now.
[10:50.200 --> 10:55.200]  We'll play the audio of some of our official trailers that we made coming up later today,
[10:55.200 --> 10:57.200]  dealing with the film Truth Rising.
[10:57.200 --> 11:01.200]  Find out about the Truth Rising at infowars.com.
[11:01.200 --> 11:03.200]  Okay, here are the stacks.
[11:03.200 --> 11:09.200]  We have Israel prodding, U.S. to attack Iran, CBS News, large stack of similar news.

[11:35.200 --> 11:37.200]  being covered up by the media.
[11:37.200 --> 11:40.200]  Texas real estate slump lets Mexicans take it back.
[11:40.200 --> 11:47.200]  Rich Mexicans say they're buying up Texas and now more than a dozen towns fly the Mexican flag in Texas.
[11:47.200 --> 11:50.200]  No English allowed in court and no gringos allowed.
[11:50.200 --> 11:52.200]  Bloomberg financial.
[11:52.200 --> 11:55.200]  They're saying it's good, of course. Everything's fine.
[11:55.200 --> 11:59.200]  Sarkozy lays out a plan to tax the Internet, thought I'd throw that in there.
[11:59.200 --> 12:04.200]  Libs blast disappointment with Obama over the fives of betrayal.
[12:04.200 --> 12:05.200]  He said he'd vote against it.
[12:05.200 --> 12:06.200]  Of course, he voted for it.
[12:06.200 --> 12:11.200]  He is a complete congenital liar and totally neural order controlled.
[12:11.200 --> 12:14.200]  That is just some of the news we have in that stack.
[12:14.200 --> 12:15.200]  I'll be going over in more detail.
[12:15.200 --> 12:18.200]  Of course, the energy and dollar devaluation news.
[12:18.200 --> 12:23.200]  Well, prices hit record above $142 a barrel Friday.
[12:23.200 --> 12:27.200]  New York Stock Exchange slumps as oil hits record high.
[12:27.200 --> 12:29.200]  OPEC chief, you think that's bad.
[12:29.200 --> 12:33.200]  He sees $170 a barrel oil coming.
[12:33.200 --> 12:36.200]  OPEC prices rebound as OPEC predicts fresh highs.
[12:36.200 --> 12:39.200]  Oil, again, went over $142, set to go to $170.

[12:50.200 --> 12:54.200]  OPEC leader says dollar will drive oil to $170.
[12:54.200 --> 12:59.200]  Finally, out of all our mainstream news, one article tells what all the foreigners,
[12:59.200 --> 13:04.200]  Germany, France, Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, and they're not happy about it.
[13:04.200 --> 13:06.200]  They begged the government not to do this.
[13:06.200 --> 13:10.200]  Our government did it in the last six years, and they've killed the dollar.
[13:10.200 --> 13:12.200]  They've killed us.
[13:12.200 --> 13:15.200]  And I hear every financial show in the U.S.
[13:15.200 --> 13:17.200]  I hear local shows.
[13:17.200 --> 13:18.200]  You call into them.
[13:18.200 --> 13:20.200]  The call screeners won't let you on to talk about it.
[13:20.200 --> 13:24.200]  Everyone just runs around like a pack of idiots, leading idiots,
[13:24.200 --> 13:28.200]  bumbling about blaming oil companies, blaming speculators.
[13:28.200 --> 13:30.200]  The dollar is in the toilet.
[13:30.200 --> 13:32.200]  Period!
[13:32.200 --> 13:36.200]  Period, period, period, period, period.
[13:36.200 --> 13:39.200]  And it's a political decision, and if the people would wake up to it,
[13:39.200 --> 13:40.200]  we could have reversed it.
[13:40.200 --> 13:41.200]  But you're going to find out.
[13:41.200 --> 13:42.200]  Don't worry.
[13:42.200 --> 13:45.200]  When you realize we're in a full-blown depression,
[13:45.200 --> 13:50.200]  sucking your thumb with guys in black uniforms feeding you into FEMA camps,
[13:50.200 --> 13:52.200]  then you'll know about the dollar.
[13:52.200 --> 13:58.200]  But until then, you pack of mindless, greedy neocon baboons and mainline liberals

[14:10.200 --> 14:12.200]  It is destroying the world economy.
[14:12.200 --> 14:18.200]  But the psychos running things want it by design and will tell you why.
[14:18.200 --> 14:21.200]  And no, it isn't Bush or it isn't Obama.
[14:21.200 --> 14:23.200]  Let's forget about the little left-right fight.
[14:23.200 --> 14:27.200]  They get you all focused on like a football game while the real world
[14:27.200 --> 14:30.200]  goes on behind the curtain, boys.
[14:30.200 --> 14:33.200]  So finally, it's in some of our media.
[14:33.200 --> 14:35.200]  What's behind the dollars decline in value?
[14:35.200 --> 14:36.200]  Los Angeles Times.
[14:36.200 --> 14:43.200]  City Group sinks to 10-year low, Goldman urges short sale, Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
[14:43.200 --> 14:47.200]  They've put, what, $300 billion in a city group and they can't prop it up.
[14:47.200 --> 14:49.200]  It's got over $35 trillion in derivatives.
[14:49.200 --> 14:50.200]  That's right.
[14:50.200 --> 14:54.200]  There's thousands of times paper what their Israel assets in the world.
[14:54.200 --> 15:00.200]  You understand, ladies and gentlemen, this will make the depression look like heaven on earth
[15:00.200 --> 15:02.200]  if it continues to unfold.
[15:02.200 --> 15:06.200]  Meanwhile, you won't figure it out till it's too late because you're powerful yuppies
[15:06.200 --> 15:09.200]  and you just giggle and snicker at everything.
[15:09.200 --> 15:13.200]  Credit crunch, forcing US middle classes to live in their cars.
[15:13.200 --> 15:18.200]  Bill Clinton says, Barack Obama must kiss my ass for his support.
[15:18.200 --> 15:20.200]  London Telegraph headline.
[15:20.200 --> 15:25.200]  Supermodel, probably murdered, but who knows, these people are so decadent.
[15:25.200 --> 15:27.200]  She might have thrown herself out of there.
[15:27.200 --> 15:30.200]  Falls off a building and dies.
[15:30.200 --> 15:32.200]  Global warming taxes coming in.
[15:32.200 --> 15:34.200]  Mass raping of the population.
[15:34.200 --> 15:35.200]  Total bedlam.
[15:35.200 --> 15:37.200]  Massive gun control.
[15:37.200 --> 15:39.200]  Act passed by the Supreme Court.
[15:39.200 --> 15:40.200]  Idiot public told.
[15:40.200 --> 15:42.200]  It's a pro-gun ruling.
[15:42.200 --> 15:46.200]  You'll hear the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth straight ahead.

[18:10.200 --> 18:13.200]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives,

[20:09.340 --> 20:14.420]  Today's Sunday, we're here, 4 to 6 PM Central, folks listening in stations on the East Coast.
[20:14.420 --> 20:20.420]  You know what that means, 5 to 7, people out in the mountain areas, 3 to 5, Pacific, 2
[20:20.420 --> 20:21.420]  to 4.
[20:21.420 --> 20:26.740]  It's an abbreviated Sunday edition, 5 days a week, 4 hours a day, hitting enough for me
[20:26.740 --> 20:30.500]  weekdays.
[20:30.500 --> 20:36.660]  We are here going toe to toe with the New World Order, the Fortune 100 Global Crime Syndicate
[20:36.660 --> 20:41.740]  that own the private banks, the printing machines, they flooded the world with pure liquidity
[20:41.740 --> 20:44.540]  to buy up the real assets.
[20:44.540 --> 20:49.260]  Now they're leaving a vanguard of police state systems so that they can't be punished
[20:49.260 --> 20:51.380]  for their crimes.
[20:51.380 --> 20:53.820]  They are not playing games.
[20:53.820 --> 20:56.340]  This is the real world.
[20:56.340 --> 21:01.020]  The United States is being systematically dismantled as we speak.
[21:01.020 --> 21:07.340]  Within 3 years, it will be fully dismantled if we are unable to warn and then rally the
[21:07.340 --> 21:12.780]  people to resist the crime syndicate that has seized control of the federal government,
[21:12.780 --> 21:18.140]  both political parties, and most state governments.
[21:18.140 --> 21:20.980]  There is a mass criminal looting going on.
[21:20.980 --> 21:23.580]  That is what tyranny is.
[21:23.580 --> 21:25.180]  Here's some of the other news I have.
[21:25.180 --> 21:27.340]  This is the London Telegraph.
[21:27.340 --> 21:33.060]  Government permission required for parents to kiss their children or to hug them or to
[21:33.060 --> 21:35.220]  change them or to dress them.
[21:35.220 --> 21:38.940]  It's now pedophilia to change your baby's diapers.
[21:38.940 --> 21:42.000]  This is how the government plans to break up your families.
[21:42.000 --> 21:46.260]  They will make all normal behavior criminal despite the fact that government is 5 times
[21:46.260 --> 21:50.580]  more likely to abuse children, either physically or sexually.
[21:50.580 --> 21:51.980]  They are the perverts.
[21:51.980 --> 21:57.980]  That's why they say kissing your child in the forehead or hugging them is illegal.
[21:57.980 --> 22:00.260]  I'm not joking, ladies and gentlemen.
[22:00.260 --> 22:02.220]  We're going to be covering this news article.
[22:02.220 --> 22:06.500]  They're now making it law in the UK, trying to make it the law here.
[22:06.500 --> 22:10.340]  In fact, when we posted these mainstream articles Friday, there were a lot of comments on our
[22:10.340 --> 22:15.740]  message section to other local stories where CPS, neighbors will see a father or mother
[22:15.740 --> 22:20.580]  hug their child in the backyard, CPS comes, take your children, and they say you're not
[22:20.580 --> 22:22.740]  to hug your children.
[22:22.740 --> 22:26.940]  This is your sick, degenerate, filthy government.
[22:26.940 --> 22:28.620]  This is who they are.
[22:28.620 --> 22:32.700]  Don't forget the Texas Youth Commission with the giant rape facilities at every major
[22:32.700 --> 22:33.940]  youth facility.
[22:33.940 --> 22:36.940]  Texas Rangers, Boston, they're not allowed to bring it public.
[22:36.940 --> 22:38.820]  It's all over the country.
[22:38.820 --> 22:40.300]  It is hell on earth.
[22:40.300 --> 22:45.940]  Just in Boston with masses of cocaine and marijuana.
[22:45.940 --> 22:46.940]  Of course.
[22:46.940 --> 22:49.060]  Who do you think deals the drugs?
[22:49.060 --> 22:51.500]  Who do you think does all this stuff?
[22:51.500 --> 22:53.940]  It's the scum that runs everything.
[22:53.940 --> 22:56.220]  It's scum, criminals everywhere.
[22:56.220 --> 22:57.780]  They're total degenerates.
[22:57.780 --> 23:00.580]  Look at their track record.
[23:00.580 --> 23:01.580]  Is there some good government?
[23:01.580 --> 23:02.580]  Yes.
[23:02.580 --> 23:05.180]  That's why you've got so many police busting themselves.
[23:05.180 --> 23:08.340]  But the point is, is that we're in trouble, folks.
[23:08.340 --> 23:09.900]  Red level emergency.
[23:09.900 --> 23:14.180]  Evil has gotten in almost every position of power in government, and they're bringing
[23:14.180 --> 23:15.180]  in their buddies.
[23:15.180 --> 23:17.140]  It's like pirates taking over a ship.
[23:17.140 --> 23:19.740]  We're in a fight for the deck right now.
[23:19.740 --> 23:21.420]  It's desperate.
[23:21.420 --> 23:25.060]  They're about to take the ship fully, and then you get Nazi Germany, then you get Soviet
[23:25.060 --> 23:26.060]  Russia.
[23:26.060 --> 23:27.060]  It isn't fun.
[23:27.060 --> 23:28.060]  It isn't a cakewalk.
[23:28.060 --> 23:30.060]  It isn't a game.
[23:30.060 --> 23:33.260]  Oh, man.
[23:33.260 --> 23:34.380]  Some of the news I have here.
[23:34.380 --> 23:35.380]  You know what?
[23:35.380 --> 23:36.380]  I'm just going to go through financial now.
[23:36.380 --> 23:37.380]  I'm going to calm down.
[23:37.380 --> 23:38.380]  I read through some of the headlines.
[23:38.380 --> 23:39.380]  I'm going to go through it.
[23:39.380 --> 23:43.180]  Then I'm going to get into how they want to have war, and what that'll mean.
[23:43.180 --> 23:44.500]  You think gas prices are bad.
[23:44.500 --> 23:45.900]  How about $10 a gallon?
[23:45.900 --> 23:47.820]  You're going to be paying it.
[23:47.820 --> 23:50.860]  20 people killed in Mexican border city.
[23:50.860 --> 23:52.540]  I'm going to get into all this.
[23:52.540 --> 23:54.820]  It's just total bedlam.
[23:54.820 --> 23:57.260]  But first off, BBC.
[23:57.260 --> 24:00.020]  Oil prices at $142 right.
[24:00.020 --> 24:03.300]  In the future, they're trading as high as $143.
[24:03.300 --> 24:11.100]  Now then you have the head of OPEC come out and say, Reuters, OPEC chief sees oil at $170
[24:11.100 --> 24:14.020]  in coming months.
[24:14.020 --> 24:19.220]  Oil prices could rise as much as $170 per barrel in the coming months, but are unlikely
[24:19.220 --> 24:25.660]  to hit $200, and should ease towards the end of the year, OPEC president Chiquit Cayillo
[24:25.660 --> 24:27.580]  said in an interview on Thursday.
[24:27.580 --> 24:31.340]  Now, remember, they always go down in the winter, fall and winter, and they always go
[24:31.340 --> 24:33.500]  back up in the summer, as I predicted last week.
[24:33.500 --> 24:36.540]  They're going to run up, I said $150 a few months ago.
[24:36.540 --> 24:41.740]  It's higher than that, $150 a barrel, then it'll drop back down to $125.
[24:41.740 --> 24:44.780]  People think that's great when three years ago you were paying $50 a barrel and thought
[24:44.780 --> 24:46.380]  that was high.
[24:46.380 --> 24:52.620]  Then next summer, it's going to go to $200, and it's going to sit at about $205 unless
[24:52.620 --> 24:54.820]  they totally get rid of the dollar.
[24:54.820 --> 25:01.060]  That will be the dollar with about 16% of its value if they go to $200.
[25:01.060 --> 25:04.940]  Right now, it's got less than 40% of its value.
[25:04.940 --> 25:07.620]  It's all because of that.
[25:07.620 --> 25:11.100]  And Bilderberg said two years ago, he went and covered their conference, infiltrated,
[25:11.100 --> 25:18.060]  got the documents, as usual, earth-shattering stuff that we go through, but just decking
[25:18.060 --> 25:23.140]  it mindless, baboon public, doesn't even realize what pearls are thrown before them.
[25:23.140 --> 25:29.660]  That we told you it'd be $200 by 2009, and that it'd be $150 by this summer.
[25:29.660 --> 25:31.180]  And now, where is it?
[25:31.180 --> 25:34.180]  Oh, we just magically pull these numbers out of it.
[25:34.180 --> 25:37.340]  Go listen to all the podcasts, go listen to all the shows saved on the web.
[25:37.340 --> 25:38.340]  Go, go.
[25:38.340 --> 25:39.340]  Go read the articles we've written.
[25:39.340 --> 25:44.020]  I mean, I demand you pay attention to what I'm saying because if you had political will
[25:44.020 --> 25:49.980]  and if you knew the difference between fake politics with Barack Obama and that albino
[25:49.980 --> 25:59.140]  gerbil McCain, then you would understand, ladies and gentlemen, that this is serious business.
[25:59.140 --> 26:04.460]  This is very serious business, that there's real stuff going on in the world.
[26:04.460 --> 26:08.380]  OPEC chief sees oil at $150 to $170 in coming months.
[26:08.380 --> 26:12.860]  I forecast prices probably between $150 and $170 during the summer, though perhaps east
[26:12.860 --> 26:15.060]  towards the end of the year.
[26:15.060 --> 26:20.380]  The comments came as crude oil prices shot above $140 a barrel.
[26:20.380 --> 26:21.380]  Unbelievable.
[26:21.380 --> 26:28.940]  Now, let me get into some of the other news here for you.
[26:28.940 --> 26:34.100]  Oil reaches $142 on view, dollar will keep falling, associated press.
[26:34.100 --> 26:39.980]  Now, I am on other people's talk shows and I get laughed at by the neocon host saying
[26:39.980 --> 26:41.500]  the dollar isn't the value.
[26:41.500 --> 26:43.380]  Or I cry to call into other shows in Austin.
[26:43.380 --> 26:46.500]  They won't let me on and laugh at me when I say, hey, they're having a debate wondering
[26:46.500 --> 26:47.500]  why oil is so much.
[26:47.500 --> 26:48.500]  I'd like to tell them.
[26:48.500 --> 26:50.140]  I'll listen to hours of talk radio.
[26:50.140 --> 26:52.540]  The host never get it, never understand.
[26:52.540 --> 26:58.260]  It's like a bunch of lobotomized baboons and the listeners are even stupider to all these
[26:58.260 --> 27:00.860]  shows and I just want you to know the truth.
[27:00.860 --> 27:05.540]  I mean, it'll be in the news wires, but never on your nightly news, never getting picked
[27:05.540 --> 27:08.500]  up, never being told to you.
[27:08.500 --> 27:13.260]  And this was done politically by design, by the Federal Reserve, the private bankers
[27:13.260 --> 27:17.060]  that own you.
[27:17.060 --> 27:18.260]  People say, don't be so negative.
[27:18.260 --> 27:21.700]  If I am not negative and tell you the truth, we'll never have a chance of knowing who the
[27:21.700 --> 27:23.140]  enemy is in reversing this.
[27:23.140 --> 27:29.020]  It's like saying, don't be negative about that big tumor on your brain, just decide
[27:29.020 --> 27:30.020]  it's going to be fine.
[27:30.020 --> 27:32.700]  No, I want the thing cut out.
[27:32.700 --> 27:36.020]  That's not negative to say, get it out of there.
[27:36.020 --> 27:42.380]  You understand what it's going to mean if this continues down to 15% dollar value?
[27:42.380 --> 27:43.380]  You think things are bad folks?
[27:43.380 --> 27:47.900]  It's going to be like A-bombs dropped on your cities financially.
[27:47.900 --> 27:52.980]  You know how dangerous the scum public's going to be when they're totally bankrupt?
[27:52.980 --> 27:54.900]  You understand what this means?
[27:54.900 --> 27:59.340]  Curtains, ladies and gentlemen, if you don't grow up, if you yuppies and people that have
[27:59.340 --> 28:04.500]  got some power in the system, don't stop being jackasses that believe whatever the mainstream
[28:04.500 --> 28:06.300]  media says.

[28:23.460 --> 28:27.500]  Here is the New York Times, gloom descends over Wall Street again.
[28:27.500 --> 28:33.460]  I'll come back and tell you what's behind this and tell you where we're going, downhill
[28:33.460 --> 28:44.340]  into a Hades-like financial system, ultra-hyper, warp inflation, a depressionary inflation.
[28:44.340 --> 28:47.700]  Not 1929 US, 1929 Germany.
[28:47.700 --> 28:49.060]  You better look into the difference.
[28:49.060 --> 28:51.580]  We'll be right back.

[32:43.260 --> 32:48.020]  Our call is today at 888-891-1122.
[32:48.020 --> 33:08.860]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[33:08.860 --> 33:17.420]  Since the founding of this nation more than 200 years ago, there has been less than 1%
[33:17.420 --> 33:27.860]  inflation or devaluation in the dollar until around 1900.
[33:27.860 --> 33:33.060]  By the time the private banking families took over our banking system and our currency
[33:33.060 --> 33:42.900]  issuance and control and liquidity controlled, we have had a 99% devaluation in value.
[33:42.900 --> 33:48.660]  Now more than half that devaluation has happened just in the last eight years alone.
[33:48.660 --> 33:52.180]  There is now about 1 cent of value left.
[33:52.180 --> 33:54.660]  That is what you think of as the value of the dollar.
[33:54.660 --> 34:00.780]  Now in that 1 cent, if things continue in the next two and a half years, it will lose
[34:00.780 --> 34:04.740]  down to less than 20% of its value.
[34:04.740 --> 34:06.060]  We're talking PESA.
[34:06.060 --> 34:07.940]  We're talking ruble.
[34:07.940 --> 34:10.940]  This has never happened in the Republic.
[34:10.940 --> 34:16.540]  Now when Mexico did this in the 80s, or Argentina did it in 2000, everybody knows what it is.
[34:16.540 --> 34:21.740]  They're corrupt regimes for the decade before by villas in Switzerland and by oil companies
[34:21.740 --> 34:28.420]  and by aircraft manufacturing lines and by massive stocks in defense.
[34:28.420 --> 34:32.980]  In areas outside their country, they devalue the currency and then overnight it is learned
[34:32.980 --> 34:39.420]  that that happens and you have a slide into even first world nations like Argentina.
[34:39.420 --> 34:44.180]  They are gone, are destroyed.
[34:44.180 --> 34:46.980]  That's what happened in Argentina.
[34:46.980 --> 34:51.660]  The old saying riches in Argentina, they don't say that anymore.
[34:51.660 --> 34:55.460]  In fact, in some cities, they had a higher standard than we do here.
[34:55.460 --> 34:56.460]  Not anymore.
[34:56.460 --> 34:58.980]  Total third world, total crime, total police state.
[34:58.980 --> 35:00.580]  The elites all move out.
[35:00.580 --> 35:01.700]  The Jets leave.
[35:01.700 --> 35:02.700]  The elites leave.
[35:02.700 --> 35:05.820]  The elites of the U.S. have been leaving for about six years.
[35:05.820 --> 35:06.820]  All of them.
[35:06.820 --> 35:11.460]  Democrats, Republicans, Dick Cheney, the Hollywood people, they're all moving out.
[35:11.460 --> 35:13.580]  They're all leaving.
[35:13.580 --> 35:16.900]  Blackwater, Halliburton, Cheney, all going to Dubai.
[35:16.900 --> 35:18.580]  Everybody's going.
[35:18.580 --> 35:19.580]  Everybody's leaving.
[35:19.580 --> 35:20.780]  You understand?
[35:20.780 --> 35:25.060]  And then they even write about it in different Pentagon journals and they write about it
[35:25.060 --> 35:28.140]  in British Ministry of Defense documents.
[35:28.140 --> 35:30.260]  They say it's over.
[35:30.260 --> 35:32.820]  They have used us to fund the new world order.
[35:32.820 --> 35:34.300]  Now it's going to rise.
[35:34.300 --> 35:38.660]  We get the blame, the U.S. gets the blame for the wars and the torture all by design.
[35:38.660 --> 35:42.140]  They leave a rear guard of domestic propaganda that neutralized us to think we were the
[35:42.140 --> 35:48.580]  good guys while the newspapers, the globalists own, demonized us for their actions outside
[35:48.580 --> 35:49.580]  the country.
[35:49.580 --> 35:54.300]  You understand how masterfully that was done?
[35:54.300 --> 35:55.540]  And we've still got a chance.
[35:55.540 --> 35:59.580]  We've got a lot of wealth, a lot of ideas, but you're so mesmerized, they decided to
[35:59.580 --> 36:00.580]  go with it.
[36:00.580 --> 36:05.300]  They decided to fully drop the hammer on you because even when you are living, you know,
[36:05.300 --> 36:11.100]  even when things are really bad, you will still lick and suck the boots of government.
[36:11.100 --> 36:18.820]  You will still worship the liars if they wear a American flag on their suit lapel.
[36:18.820 --> 36:23.500]  I mean, folks, I was out on a, you know, deep sea fishing cruise just in the Gulf for a
[36:23.500 --> 36:24.500]  day.
[36:24.500 --> 36:28.140]  A couple of weeks ago, I was talking to business owners, you know, guys who claim they were
[36:28.140 --> 36:31.860]  millionaires, they didn't know about the dollar devaluation.
[36:31.860 --> 36:33.180]  I talked to people at the gym.
[36:33.180 --> 36:34.180]  They don't know.
[36:34.180 --> 36:39.300]  I just happened to be at a meeting where an oil company owner was this last week of a
[36:39.300 --> 36:41.020]  pretty good sized oil company.
[36:41.020 --> 36:45.220]  He knew about dollar devaluation but hadn't thought about it.
[36:45.220 --> 36:49.820]  I mean, but everybody outside the country, the Germans, the Dutch, the Russians, the
[36:49.820 --> 36:57.060]  Chinese, the Swiss, the everybody, the people in Qatar, the people in Israel, it's all they're
[36:57.060 --> 36:58.060]  talking about.
[36:58.060 --> 37:02.940]  And we are literally, I mean, I made myself call into a couple of talk shows this weekend
[37:02.940 --> 37:03.940]  I heard.
[37:03.940 --> 37:05.300]  One on this station, another on another.
[37:05.300 --> 37:09.740]  And I got through, used a fake name and just said, you're talking about oil all day.
[37:09.740 --> 37:10.740]  Yeah.
[37:10.740 --> 37:13.940]  I mean, it's, it's, it's the dollar is devalued.
[37:13.940 --> 37:20.580]  Will you please read AP and Reuters and press releases by the oil companies and by everybody
[37:20.580 --> 37:25.780]  else instead, but see that's in the newswires, but never on the news.
[37:25.780 --> 37:30.780]  Most of what I tell you is in like, like George Bush funded the illegal alien rallies.
[37:30.780 --> 37:32.220]  Republican party funded that.
[37:32.220 --> 37:36.020]  That even made it in Dallas morning news three years ago that people still call me a conspiracy
[37:36.020 --> 37:38.020]  theorist.
[37:38.020 --> 37:41.340]  Rob Allen and co Republican strategy group funded it.
[37:41.340 --> 37:47.780]  Republican party funded it while they prance around claiming they're going to fix it.
[37:47.780 --> 37:53.100]  I mean, it's frustrating to see you being gold, to see you being manipulated.
[37:53.100 --> 37:56.740]  Listen, let me read to you, Bloomberg, okay?
[37:56.740 --> 37:59.820]  This is Bloomberg financial.
[37:59.820 --> 38:02.700]  You will never see this on the news though.
[38:02.700 --> 38:07.580]  OPEC leader says dollar will drive oil to 170.
[38:07.580 --> 38:10.580]  It's all the dollar case closed.
[38:10.580 --> 38:11.580]  No debate.
[38:11.580 --> 38:14.300]  I've been telling you this for six years in horror.
[38:14.300 --> 38:18.340]  I thought when it lost 10% of its value in a year, I was freaking out and then it kept
[38:18.340 --> 38:19.340]  losing, kept losing.
[38:19.340 --> 38:22.660]  And I've just been panicking and totally this is it.
[38:22.660 --> 38:23.660]  You understand?
[38:23.660 --> 38:24.660]  It's over.
[38:24.660 --> 38:25.660]  You know what this means?
[38:25.660 --> 38:31.860]  Third world for real folks and all I want to do is warn you.
[38:31.860 --> 38:33.180]  I love this country.
[38:33.180 --> 38:35.580]  I cry when I hear the star spangled banner.
[38:35.580 --> 38:40.460]  I'm a real red, white and blue, not one of you fake little bastards that supported this
[38:40.460 --> 38:46.540]  war that's bankrupted us and was meant to destroy our name in sophisticated global chess.
[38:46.540 --> 38:52.180]  You have no idea what you've gone along with, but you're going to find out now.
[38:52.180 --> 38:56.780]  OPEC leader, president predicted that the price of oil will climb to 170 a barrel before
[38:56.780 --> 39:00.900]  the end of the year, citing the dollar's decline.
[39:00.900 --> 39:04.700]  That's all it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[39:04.700 --> 39:09.300]  Oil prices are expected to reach 170 as demand for fuel is growing in the U.S. in the summer
[39:09.300 --> 39:13.780]  period and the dollar continues to weaken against the euro.
[39:13.780 --> 39:21.220]  They're paying 24 cents in Brazil, 14 cents in Venezuela, 40 something cents in Mexico.
[39:21.220 --> 39:23.140]  They're not paying more around the world.
[39:23.140 --> 39:27.220]  Only the schmucks pay five times more for prescription drugs.
[39:27.220 --> 39:29.860]  You guessed it, us than everybody else.
[39:29.860 --> 39:34.500]  Only the idiots, only the decadent sports fans that didn't want to know about how the
[39:34.500 --> 39:35.500]  world worked.
[39:35.500 --> 39:40.060]  Do you think in Germany and in China and in Russia, this isn't headlines, it is every
[39:40.060 --> 39:46.540]  day for years because they can't feed their people bull as dumb down as they are.
[39:46.540 --> 39:47.540]  Only us.
[39:47.540 --> 39:52.620]  And look, I'm not sardonic here thinking I'm smart, I'm just an average guy.
[39:52.620 --> 39:55.300]  That's like a god compared to the general public.
[39:55.300 --> 40:02.300]  And it's time for you to stop having mental midget brains and to decide that it's important
[40:02.300 --> 40:05.780]  to figure out what's going on and you're not going to get that from whatever filters
[40:05.780 --> 40:08.620]  onto TV or mainline talk radio.
[40:08.620 --> 40:09.620]  You understand?
[40:09.620 --> 40:12.880]  You don't have to believe Alex Jones or some conspiracy site.
[40:12.880 --> 40:14.940]  You can go to the government documents.
[40:14.940 --> 40:16.540]  You can go to the rulings.
[40:16.540 --> 40:17.980]  You can go to the foreign press.
[40:17.980 --> 40:19.820]  You can go to the newswires.
[40:19.820 --> 40:22.540]  You know, let's say there's a thousand AP articles a day.
[40:22.540 --> 40:24.940]  You probably see five in your paper.
[40:24.940 --> 40:27.900]  And the five you see in your paper are in every other paper.
[40:27.900 --> 40:29.140]  That's the gatekeepers.
[40:29.140 --> 40:30.580]  You want to go find out what's really going on.
[40:30.580 --> 40:35.540]  Go read a Reuters or an AFP or a UPI newswire sometimes, folks.
[40:35.540 --> 40:36.540]  You know what's in there?
[40:36.540 --> 40:42.020]  Car bombs, truck bombings, Mexican troops slaughtering people in Texas, Arizona, California,
[40:42.020 --> 40:48.300]  Indiana, towns falling to Mexico, Mexican flags running up, whites being slaughtered,
[40:48.300 --> 40:50.420]  blacks being slaughtered.
[40:50.420 --> 40:52.180]  You'll never hear it on your news.
[40:52.180 --> 40:58.300]  TB exploding, drug resistant TB everywhere, huge sanitariums being set up, leprosy spreading
[40:58.300 --> 41:04.140]  everywhere, flesh eating bacteria killing kids in every town every day of the week.
[41:04.140 --> 41:06.020]  Total insanity, ladies and gentlemen.
[41:06.020 --> 41:07.300]  You'll never hear it.
[41:07.300 --> 41:08.780]  You'll never know about it.
[41:08.780 --> 41:10.060]  You understand?
[41:10.060 --> 41:15.820]  This show is a tiny little pinprick through that electronic Berlin wall.
[41:15.820 --> 41:21.460]  And you bet I'm freaked out, folks, because our country's falling into third world and
[41:21.460 --> 41:28.380]  the elite are using a highly nationalistic, narco-terrorist, incredibly corrupt nation.
[41:28.380 --> 41:33.500]  What other nation has an animal killing another animal on its flag to basically overrun and
[41:33.500 --> 41:35.460]  destroy the U.S.?
[41:35.460 --> 41:39.660]  And the media tries to spin it and say, oh, you're not probing borders.
[41:39.660 --> 41:41.220]  You don't like Mexican Americans.
[41:41.220 --> 41:46.820]  Oh, is that why close to 70% of Mexican Americans in every major Gallup poll and other poll,
[41:46.820 --> 41:52.860]  Angus and Reed, Mason, Dixon, Scripps Howard are against the open borders?
[41:52.860 --> 41:54.100]  They know it's destroying their wages.
[41:54.100 --> 42:00.220]  The media says all Hispanics want open borders and then make them feel bad if they don't.
[42:00.220 --> 42:06.140]  And the LaRica conquistas then attack them because they're patriotic Americans.
[42:06.140 --> 42:10.820]  And all the big Fortune 500, the big beer makers and the NFL and all of them fund the
[42:10.820 --> 42:15.180]  LaRica conquista, the reconquering, because that's their agenda.
[42:15.180 --> 42:16.500]  That's what they're here for.
[42:16.500 --> 42:18.740]  That's what the new order wants.
[42:18.740 --> 42:23.260]  And don't worry, we're going to be a peon slave state.
[42:23.260 --> 42:25.980]  Don't worry, all of you out there, you'll get what you want.
[42:25.980 --> 42:29.980]  The only semi-free country is falling, falling, falling.
[42:29.980 --> 42:32.820]  They're getting rid of the Fourth Amendment, the Second, everything else.
[42:32.820 --> 42:37.260]  The Supreme Court ruling says they can take your guns, and I told you they'd tell you
[42:37.260 --> 42:40.940]  it was a gun victory, because I know what I'm talking about.
[42:40.940 --> 42:45.460]  We'll be right back with more news you can't afford to miss.
[42:45.460 --> 42:47.100]  Stay with us.
[42:47.100 --> 42:58.020]  In fact, rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on
[42:58.020 --> 42:59.780]  world health is staggering.
[42:59.780 --> 43:04.060]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[43:04.060 --> 43:08.460]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world
[43:08.460 --> 43:11.740]  in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[43:11.740 --> 43:12.740]  The solution.
[43:12.740 --> 43:16.700]  Detoxification integrated with electro-cheap premier energy foot spa.
[43:16.700 --> 43:20.980]  The electro-cheap premier energy foot spa helps to aid in cleansing the body of harmful
[43:20.980 --> 43:26.660]  toxins while energizing and oxygenating your entire body at the cellular level.
[43:26.660 --> 43:30.100]  Detoxification works with the electro-cheap premier energy foot spa because it addresses

[43:35.100 --> 43:40.260]  restored vitality, a stronger immune system, clear skin, and health in every aspect of

[44:40.460 --> 44:58.060]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[44:58.060 --> 45:03.020]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[45:03.020 --> 45:07.700]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the
[45:07.700 --> 45:12.380]  US, though the people of the US where their numbers and influence are strongest have primary
[45:12.380 --> 45:15.820]  responsibility for reigning the men and bringing them to justice.
[45:15.820 --> 45:19.460]  All nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[45:19.460 --> 45:23.860]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[45:23.860 --> 45:26.640]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[45:26.640 --> 45:31.140]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago, everything they have built
[45:31.140 --> 45:35.820]  over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning
[45:35.820 --> 45:40.820]  of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority
[45:40.820 --> 45:43.180]  that has now been delegated to us.

[45:53.540 --> 45:57.980]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints,
[45:57.980 --> 46:02.300]  lack of energy and weight gain, I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet, but
[46:02.300 --> 46:04.300]  it just seems so difficult.
[46:04.300 --> 46:09.420]  When a friend suggested I try a Jupiter water ionizer from SnyderHealth.com and detox my
[46:09.420 --> 46:14.300]  body even before I changed my diet by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[46:14.300 --> 46:15.300]  Drinking water?
[46:15.300 --> 46:16.980]  No, that's something I can handle.
[46:16.980 --> 46:20.420]  The guys at SnyderHealth took the time to explain all of the different options and helped me
[46:20.420 --> 46:22.540]  choose the ionizer that was right for me.
[46:22.540 --> 46:26.860]  I use my new Jupiter ionizer for everything, for drinking, for cooking, and since I've
[46:26.860 --> 46:31.580]  been drinking the water, I have more energy, my joint pains are gone, and I already lost
[46:31.580 --> 46:34.860]  7 pounds, and my skin looks great.
[46:34.860 --> 46:41.780]  Give them a call today at 877-356-2508 to find out which ionizer is right for you.

[46:49.580 --> 46:55.420]  That's S-N-Y-D-E-R-Health.com.
[46:55.420 --> 46:57.980]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[46:57.980 --> 47:07.740]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[47:07.740 --> 47:10.860]  Coming up is the next Friday, July 4th.
[47:10.860 --> 47:16.740]  Just remember, the people claiming they're patriotic in both parties that put American
[47:16.740 --> 47:20.620]  flags in your face all day or the very globalists destroying this nation.
[47:20.620 --> 47:21.620]  They want tyranny.
[47:21.620 --> 47:27.620]  They want third world serfdom, a bunch of dumbed-down, economically bankrupt slaves.
[47:27.620 --> 47:29.500]  They can push around.
[47:29.500 --> 47:31.180]  What elites have always wanted.
[47:31.180 --> 47:33.140]  Now, listen to this.
[47:33.140 --> 47:39.620]  Now, folks, this is a small part of the Mexico news of the last three days.
[47:39.620 --> 47:42.980]  20 people killed in Mexican border city.
[47:42.980 --> 47:46.740]  Police say 20 people have been killed in less than three days in the crime-ridden border
[47:46.740 --> 47:47.740]  city.
[47:47.740 --> 47:50.620]  The latest wave of violence.
[47:50.620 --> 47:54.980]  From Texas to California, just 20 just outside Texas.
[47:54.980 --> 47:59.700]  State police spokesman Cesar Ramirez says a father and son were killed at their home
[47:59.700 --> 48:05.740]  while sleeping, where among the victims, a third victim was a man whose body was cut
[48:05.740 --> 48:09.460]  up in pieces and dumped in a empty lot.
[48:09.460 --> 48:14.740]  Ramirez said this year alone more than 500 people have been killed in Juarez across the
[48:14.740 --> 48:15.740]  border from El Paso.
[48:15.740 --> 48:17.100]  Now, let's stop right there.
[48:17.100 --> 48:20.500]  It was over 600 killed just in 2006.
[48:20.500 --> 48:21.900]  I remember in Texas alone.
[48:21.900 --> 48:25.380]  I mean, I remember going down to that area, Nuevo Laredo and stuff in college.
[48:25.380 --> 48:26.380]  It was fun.
[48:26.380 --> 48:32.100]  You go down there and it was cheap because their peso was like our dollar and it was
[48:32.100 --> 48:33.100]  devalued.
[48:33.100 --> 48:35.940]  You can go down there and you have a fun weekend.
[48:35.940 --> 48:37.660]  Now it's all boarded up, all shut down.
[48:37.660 --> 48:38.660]  My cousin's been down there.
[48:38.660 --> 48:41.020]  I've been down there the last few years.
[48:41.020 --> 48:44.340]  The State Department says it's more dangerous than the West Bank of Israel.
[48:44.340 --> 48:49.020]  They're killing US cops everywhere, but when they kill a cop, it's kept quiet.
[48:49.020 --> 48:55.260]  Like a drug runner killed a cop a few months ago and Mexico got him.
[48:55.260 --> 48:57.260]  And then the judge just said, I'm letting you go.
[48:57.260 --> 48:59.100]  It was actually a Border Patrol agent.
[48:59.100 --> 49:02.660]  They just said basically good job, kill more Americans.
[49:02.660 --> 49:07.260]  I mean, the Mexican troops routinely kill our military.
[49:07.260 --> 49:08.980]  Our military's told to run.
[49:08.980 --> 49:10.100]  They're not allowed to have bullets.
[49:10.100 --> 49:11.380]  They routinely kill Border Patrol.
[49:11.380 --> 49:15.380]  I mean, every few months I see it in the news where they kill our military or they kill
[49:15.380 --> 49:16.540]  FBI.
[49:16.540 --> 49:22.100]  And it's always in the back of a news wire because you're not supposed to know that
[49:22.100 --> 49:23.980]  Mexico hates this country.
[49:23.980 --> 49:28.700]  You're not supposed to know that if they catch you with one marijuana cigarette or one 22
[49:28.700 --> 49:33.380]  shell casing that was underneath your seat from 10 years ago when you were out plinking,
[49:33.380 --> 49:36.980]  that they're going to suck hundreds of thousands out of you, keep you in jail for years, rape
[49:36.980 --> 49:41.660]  you, torture you, pour Tabasco down your nose to find out how much money you've got.
[49:41.660 --> 49:42.660]  Suck it off your family.
[49:42.660 --> 49:47.420]  I hope you're supposed to love Mexico, our little friend, a place where they enslave
[49:47.420 --> 49:54.620]  their people, a place that hates the US, that lost two wars with the US and one with Texas.
[49:54.620 --> 49:59.660]  And then I'm supposed to just sit here while all these towns fly Mexican flags at the courthouses.
[49:59.660 --> 50:03.260]  Oh, man, just hell.
[50:03.260 --> 50:07.380]  And see, America's becoming like Mexico.
[50:07.380 --> 50:09.700]  We're becoming a third world nation.
[50:09.700 --> 50:12.340]  And we're here to be sucked dry.
[50:12.340 --> 50:14.460]  And Mexico has more billionaires than the US.
[50:14.460 --> 50:15.460]  Did you know that?
[50:15.460 --> 50:17.340]  Mexico has triple the resources than we have.
[50:17.340 --> 50:19.780]  But the people are some of the poorest in the world.
[50:19.780 --> 50:22.780]  Once a country goes corrupt, its economy falls apart.
[50:22.780 --> 50:25.460]  But the elite want that.
[50:25.460 --> 50:27.140]  They don't like you being middle class.
[50:27.140 --> 50:28.140]  They don't.
[50:28.140 --> 50:30.900]  And they've got you all fooled with Barack Obama or George Bush.
[50:30.900 --> 50:31.900]  You're all debating that.
[50:31.900 --> 50:33.820]  And they laugh at you when they own both of them.
[50:33.820 --> 50:36.940]  And their whole agenda just continues.
[50:36.940 --> 50:37.940]  Listen to this.
[50:37.940 --> 50:44.780]  Right, I pulled up my office one night and I saw my IT guy in handcuffs, and I pull up
[50:44.780 --> 50:45.780]  in the cops all free of account.
[50:45.780 --> 50:46.780]  And they recognized me.
[50:46.780 --> 50:48.580]  Hey, Alex Jones, what's up, man?
[50:48.580 --> 50:50.820]  We're fans of the show, but you're arresting this guy.
[50:50.820 --> 50:51.820]  Why?
[50:51.820 --> 50:52.820]  Oh, his license has expired.
[50:52.820 --> 50:55.620]  And I said, but if it was illegal alien, you wouldn't arrest him.
[50:55.620 --> 50:56.620]  He goes, that's right.
[50:56.620 --> 50:57.780]  We're told not to.
[50:57.780 --> 51:01.740]  And then I've got all these news articles and cops saying, oh, yeah, we'll arrest 15
[51:01.740 --> 51:03.740]  illegals in a van with marijuana.
[51:03.740 --> 51:04.740]  We're told to release them.
[51:04.740 --> 51:08.900]  So they're drunk driving, we'll tell them to release them because the government wants
[51:08.900 --> 51:13.300]  to drive down the wages, wants to turn us into, I'm not against the poor Mexicans that
[51:13.300 --> 51:18.100]  want to leave their tyranny, except then they also hate this country because they're taught
[51:18.100 --> 51:19.100]  that from birth.
[51:19.100 --> 51:24.300]  And then I'm supposed to play along when we've got Mexican radio stations named El Norte,
[51:24.300 --> 51:28.980]  Revolution, the Raza, which means the race, and they'll have like call, call signs at
[51:28.980 --> 51:32.500]  the end of the hour for the FCC going for those inside the race, everything for those
[51:32.500 --> 51:34.260]  outside the race, nothing.
[51:34.260 --> 51:35.620]  I want to speak Spanish, folks.
[51:35.620 --> 51:38.980]  She lived in Spain for six years.
[51:38.980 --> 51:40.700]  It's, we're going to get you.
[51:40.700 --> 51:41.700]  We're going to kick over.
[51:41.700 --> 51:43.100]  We're going to kill the gringo.
[51:43.100 --> 51:44.100]  Ha, ha, ha.
[51:44.100 --> 51:46.220]  I mean, this is, it's all around you.
[51:46.220 --> 51:47.860]  You just aren't told about it.
[51:47.860 --> 51:48.860]  It's perfect.
[51:48.860 --> 51:49.860]  It's code.
[51:49.860 --> 51:52.620]  It's another language.
[51:52.620 --> 51:53.620]  And I'm not supposed to talk about it.
[51:53.620 --> 51:54.620]  I must be politically corrected.
[51:54.620 --> 51:57.060]  Oh, I won't discuss it.
[51:57.060 --> 52:00.020]  LAPD won't ask about immigrants status.
[52:00.020 --> 52:01.020]  This is AP.
[52:01.020 --> 52:02.020]  The last one was AP.
[52:02.020 --> 52:05.140]  It's like 20 deaths every few days now on our border.
[52:05.140 --> 52:09.700]  A California judge blocked a lawsuit that's sought to enlist Los Angeles police officers
[52:09.700 --> 52:11.380]  and weeding out illegal immigrants.
[52:11.380 --> 52:15.380]  And it says Los Angeles police working communities with large numbers of illegal immigrants and
[52:15.380 --> 52:19.100]  generally don't inquire about immigrant status because it could discourage and document people
[52:19.100 --> 52:21.020]  from helping officers report crimes.
[52:21.020 --> 52:24.780]  And it says here that if you've been arrested, even for a felony, they don't ask you about
[52:24.780 --> 52:25.780]  that.
[52:25.780 --> 52:26.900]  Go read the article.
[52:26.900 --> 52:31.780]  Police report Mexican army members busted for home invasion and murder.
[52:31.780 --> 52:34.140]  They caught them.
[52:34.140 --> 52:38.340]  Now I had the former head of the DEA Latin America on, Celica Stillo, a great friend
[52:38.340 --> 52:43.140]  of mine, five years ago, four and a half years ago, said the US government has trained thousands
[52:43.140 --> 52:44.500]  of Mexican military.
[52:44.500 --> 52:50.020]  They're doing hits all over Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, California, Nevada of other drug
[52:50.020 --> 52:53.220]  cartels that aren't paying a cut to US banks.
[52:53.220 --> 52:54.580]  Mexico works with the US.
[52:54.580 --> 52:56.820]  That is the crime syndicate.
[52:56.820 --> 53:00.100]  Just like our government ran all the death squads in Latin America.
[53:00.100 --> 53:03.660]  And now it's actually come out that our government's funding them, training them.
[53:03.660 --> 53:07.740]  And so it's got to be, sometimes they get out of hand, it's got to be kept quiet.
[53:07.740 --> 53:11.220]  Our criminal government runs them, you understand?
[53:11.220 --> 53:13.540]  So they get out of hand and kill a few US cops.
[53:13.540 --> 53:14.540]  So what?
[53:14.540 --> 53:17.620]  You know, like Henry Kissinger wrote and say goodbye to the boys.
[53:17.620 --> 53:20.380]  He said our military's dirt and they're to die in scum.
[53:20.380 --> 53:21.380]  They're a bunch of dumb animals.
[53:21.380 --> 53:24.300]  I don't believe that, but your government believes that about you.
[53:24.300 --> 53:28.460]  They call you dumb animals and you love it and love them as their trips kill you and
[53:28.460 --> 53:30.080]  you love them still.
[53:30.080 --> 53:35.100]  These reports show that three men arrested in Phoenix, home invasion and homicide Monday
[53:35.100 --> 53:38.780]  were active members of the Mexican military, the Mexican army.
[53:38.780 --> 53:42.820]  While on the JD Hayworth show, Phoenix law enforcement association president Mark Spencer
[53:42.820 --> 53:48.740]  to the men involved were hired by drug cartels, perform invasions and assassinations, home
[53:48.740 --> 53:50.260]  invasions and assassinations.
[53:50.260 --> 53:53.900]  Well of course, go read the articles we wrote three, four, five years ago, we wrote a bunch
[53:53.900 --> 53:55.220]  of them about this.
[53:55.220 --> 53:59.780]  I've had the sheriffs on where Mexican troops will come three miles over, pull their squad
[53:59.780 --> 54:04.220]  cars over, run them off the road and then other sheriffs will show up, the Mexican troops
[54:04.220 --> 54:09.340]  will get out in their vehicles, take the drugs back that the sheriff's department sees and
[54:09.340 --> 54:10.340]  drive off.
[54:10.340 --> 54:15.060]  I mean, we've got hundreds of videos of the coyotes, our Mexican flatback army vehicles,
[54:15.060 --> 54:19.340]  they drive across, dump the illegals off in other vans and then fire on our police if
[54:19.340 --> 54:20.500]  they do anything.
[54:20.500 --> 54:28.220]  It's Mexican armored vehicles, heckler and coke, MP5s, whole platoons, over 100 men, hundreds
[54:28.220 --> 54:30.640]  of videos.
[54:30.640 --> 54:39.020]  In one night last year, the Mexican troops burned down 26 houses in Arizona.
[54:39.020 --> 54:46.060]  They just came into a town and burned part of the town down and the scum government,
[54:46.060 --> 54:50.660]  because they're all making so much money off the coke and heroin, they will not let you
[54:50.660 --> 54:51.660]  know about it.
[54:51.660 --> 54:54.220]  You will never hear about it outside shows like this, okay?
[54:54.220 --> 55:01.900]  This is out of Phoenix TV, K-F-Y-I, okay?
[55:01.900 --> 55:06.100]  Police unions standing by Mexican militia reports, federal government told them that
[55:06.100 --> 55:10.660]  they were incorrect, they're standing by and say, we've captured the guys and they're
[55:10.660 --> 55:14.300]  in the military with IDs, Mexican troops.
[55:14.300 --> 55:21.260]  This town works, Bloomberg today, Texas real estate slump, let's Mexicans take it all back.
[55:21.260 --> 55:28.980]  More than a century after and a half after Mexico lost Texas to the U.S., Virgilio Garza
[55:28.980 --> 55:31.180]  wants a piece of it back.
[55:31.180 --> 55:36.420]  A Texas for sale sign and cowgirls and boots and white hats greets Garza at the Convex
[55:36.420 --> 55:38.340]  Center in Monterey, Mexico.
[55:38.340 --> 55:42.580]  Earlier this month, the Monterey developer and investor Garza was in search of foreclosures
[55:42.580 --> 55:45.060]  in U.S. property to buy.
[55:45.060 --> 55:48.940]  Texas is like our homes at Garza, 45 who joined hundreds of Mexicans pouring over a list
[55:48.940 --> 55:51.140]  of properties in the four-day event.
[55:51.140 --> 55:54.980]  Garza, who owns manufacturing sites in other land in Mexico, said he and five partners
[55:54.980 --> 55:57.300]  must invest as much as $8 million in Texas.
[55:57.300 --> 56:00.740]  We believe there can be more opportunities.
[56:00.740 --> 56:05.820]  A rising peso, see, we're putting the dollars going down, pesos going up, we're done.
[56:05.820 --> 56:10.020]  As long as you keep sucking your thumb and loving George Bush and Obama, okay?
[56:10.020 --> 56:14.500]  K idiots, time to wake up, time to be men and women, time to quit being gullible idiots.
[56:14.500 --> 56:20.540]  A rising peso in an economy growing faster than the U.S. has given some Mexicans, yeah,
[56:20.540 --> 56:24.620]  they're ruling elite, got more money than our people, the buying power to go over their
[56:24.620 --> 56:28.380]  little poor pathetic slaves, but see, they get to say, oh, the gringo's bad, the Americans
[56:28.380 --> 56:31.060]  are bad, go get them, and see if then they feel good.
[56:31.060 --> 56:35.380]  To take advantage of the housing slump in Texas, which the U.S. annexed in 1845, it
[56:35.380 --> 56:38.900]  were Texans gained independence from Mexico nine years earlier.
[56:38.900 --> 56:43.540]  A three-year war followed and ended with Mexico's seating about habits territory, yeah, Mexican
[56:43.540 --> 56:49.780]  troops attacked and slaughtered our military hundreds to one in one case up in Oklahoma
[56:49.780 --> 56:52.820]  and so the Marines went down there and could have taken your whole country, your whole
[56:52.820 --> 56:57.060]  God-forsaken nation over, which was stolen from other Central American countries to begin
[56:57.060 --> 56:58.060]  with.
[56:58.060 --> 57:02.980]  A three-year, they had kings, they had a German king down there, I mean, Mexico's just an
[57:02.980 --> 57:09.340]  absolute pit of corruption, just its entire history, heart-eating, blood-drinking individuals
[57:09.340 --> 57:13.100]  were running it before that, oh, don't criticize our culture, okay, the Nazis are our culture,
[57:13.100 --> 57:15.500]  I think they're an evil culture, I can say that's an evil culture.
[57:15.500 --> 57:19.460]  A three-year war followed and ended with Mexico's seating about habits territory, including
[57:19.460 --> 57:25.220]  Arizona, Nevada, and California, to the U.S. under the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo,

[1:00:02.500 --> 1:00:05.420]  promising serious talks with the opposition.
[1:00:05.420 --> 1:00:11.300]  World leaders have condemned Friday's vote, which Mugabe claims to have won overwhelmingly.
[1:00:11.300 --> 1:00:15.100]  Correspondent Angus Shaw reports that other African countries are disturbed by the election
[1:00:15.100 --> 1:00:18.620]  outcome because it doesn't represent the will of the people.
[1:00:18.620 --> 1:00:23.100]  The pan-African parliament elected lawmakers from African Union countries, which is pretty
[1:00:23.100 --> 1:00:28.060]  much continent-wide, have described the election as in no manner, free and fair, okay, caused
[1:00:28.060 --> 1:00:29.580]  by intimidation and violence.
[1:00:29.580 --> 1:00:33.940]  Levies on the Mississippi River are holding today, but damage from the waters may last
[1:00:33.940 --> 1:00:34.940]  for years.
[1:00:34.940 --> 1:00:39.500]  As water levels receded for a second straight day, officials and citizens are taking stock

[1:00:55.700 --> 1:00:57.180]  be even more devastating.
[1:00:57.180 --> 1:01:00.740]  My body was so sore, my mind was so worn out, I could not sleep at night.
[1:01:00.740 --> 1:01:03.340]  I felt self-conscious, nobody knows what that flaky news is.
[1:01:03.340 --> 1:01:05.820]  And people say, ew, it just made me feel like you're dirty.
[1:01:05.820 --> 1:01:07.340]  Oh, people know when I have this embarrassing.
[1:01:07.340 --> 1:01:10.220]  Of course I felt self-conscious, not very attractive to look at.

[1:01:59.760 --> 1:02:04.380]  Minnesota Governor Tim Fal说nty a key John McCain supporter told ABC's This Week that
[1:02:04.380 --> 1:02:08.900]  level of spending means middle-class Americans would end up paying higher taxes.
[1:02:08.900 --> 1:02:13.020]  Barack Obama has proposed his tax cuts not paying for all of his spending.
[1:02:13.020 --> 1:02:15.940]  He has proposed over a trillion dollars of new spending.
[1:02:15.940 --> 1:02:19.560]  So his tax cuts will necessarily creep into the middle class and beyond.
[1:02:19.560 --> 1:02:24.280]  Officials say Pakistani paramilitary forces have destroyed a handful of militant centers

[1:06:36.300 --> 1:06:43.580]  The imploding dollar, the imploding border, as the government allows military teams of
[1:06:43.580 --> 1:06:46.500]  murder and slaughter if付ver they want, and the complicit lobotomized media isn't
[1:06:46.500 --> 1:06:47.760]  even capable of reporting on it.

[1:06:59.520 --> 1:07:05.080]  and on global shortwave internet and satellite but just listening to Fox news
[1:07:05.080 --> 1:07:11.840]  and local news I got a comment on both of them Fox news actually finally giving
[1:07:11.840 --> 1:07:15.480]  you some real information because the White House is being so public about it
[1:07:15.480 --> 1:07:19.120]  five years ago because three and a half months into the invasion of Iraq in
[1:07:19.120 --> 1:07:25.480]  March of 2003 the White House admitted they were running three Wahhabi that's
[1:07:25.480 --> 1:07:31.360]  al-Qaeda out of Saudi Arabia groups attacking Iran uncovered operations the
[1:07:31.360 --> 1:07:37.200]  inside Hirsch four years ago reported at the New Yorker magazine that US
[1:07:37.200 --> 1:07:42.080]  special forces were leading al-Qaeda groups in bombing mosques blowing up
[1:07:42.080 --> 1:07:47.520]  police stations attacking schools because the Iranians are smart and won't
[1:07:47.520 --> 1:07:54.160]  fight back the Iranians are no they're being sucked into something now they
[1:07:54.160 --> 1:07:59.440]  think of you as such idiots that bush gets up on us tv and says Iran is
[1:07:59.440 --> 1:08:03.760]  running al-Qaeda in Afghanistan attacking the Afghan government Mohammed
[1:08:03.760 --> 1:08:08.120]  Karzai on the podium with Bush that mr. president in clear English and he's a
[1:08:08.120 --> 1:08:12.280]  unical executive and bodies of bush they knew how crazy that was in foreign
[1:08:12.280 --> 1:08:16.160]  media he said meant president mr. president that that's not true I ran a
[1:08:16.160 --> 1:08:20.920]  Shiite it's with its it's it's Sunnis that are attacking us and I ran actually
[1:08:20.920 --> 1:08:24.440]  his enemies with them and they're helping us and Bush said nope they aren't
[1:08:24.440 --> 1:08:28.520]  al-Qaeda they are attacking well that was last year what about seven eight
[1:08:28.520 --> 1:08:35.600]  months ago I mean only here do they think we're such morons and I guess we are
[1:08:35.600 --> 1:08:40.480]  morons that the the criminals running our government I'm gonna say our
[1:08:40.480 --> 1:08:44.120]  military our government but the criminal group that's hijacked at the coup the
[1:08:44.120 --> 1:08:48.840]  junta they are running al-Qaeda attacks in Iraq then the middle of last year
[1:08:48.840 --> 1:08:53.880]  about a year ago now running on air White House dot gov the White House puts
[1:08:53.880 --> 1:09:00.080]  out a press release saying we're running for revolutionary groups in military
[1:09:00.080 --> 1:09:07.760]  operations against Iran and they blew up mosque full of people they they bombed a
[1:09:07.760 --> 1:09:12.800]  bunch more schools and I ran assuming the US in the US and in England for those
[1:09:12.800 --> 1:09:16.720]  murders in the US admits they did it I mean you should our government with the
[1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:21.360]  number three in al-Qaeda this is you can't make this stuff up is blowing up
[1:09:21.360 --> 1:09:25.880]  their mosque blowing up their schools and Iran just keeps saying we stand down we
[1:09:25.880 --> 1:09:31.160]  stand down we stand down we stand down iran's been overthrown twice by the
[1:09:31.160 --> 1:09:34.880]  people that run our government they still stand down they stand our government
[1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:39.560]  keeps blowing up their jetliners Iran still stands down still stands down
[1:09:39.560 --> 1:09:47.800]  trying to go them into fighting back now here it is in plain view AP AFP
[1:09:47.800 --> 1:09:55.640]  Reuters here's a headline US gives major boost to covert ops in Iran report
[1:09:55.640 --> 1:09:59.480]  and it's and again New Yorker magazine citing former military intelligence
[1:09:59.480 --> 1:10:04.960]  congressional sources the move reveals a major escalation they're gonna bush is
[1:10:04.960 --> 1:10:09.120]  gonna give 400 million more he's already done that three times every year and a
[1:10:09.120 --> 1:10:13.040]  half of these people and they're just gonna keep I mean there's car bombings
[1:10:13.040 --> 1:10:18.480]  truck bombings blowing up mosque every week and the Iranians just take it and
[1:10:18.480 --> 1:10:23.160]  take it and take it and imagine the US getting hit every week every week killing
[1:10:23.160 --> 1:10:29.320]  our kids it's al-qaeda doing it and then those lion generals get up and say
[1:10:29.320 --> 1:10:35.160]  Iran's funding al-qaeda to attack Iraq and giving them IEDs then it turns out
[1:10:35.160 --> 1:10:40.440]  the weapons aren't Iranian made the Russian made okay so so the look that
[1:10:40.440 --> 1:10:45.080]  up generals wrong it's like 20 times the headline is they found Iranian IEDs
[1:10:45.080 --> 1:10:50.880]  improvised explosive devices then you'll read a week later in the back of the
[1:10:50.880 --> 1:10:54.400]  paper okay they were wrong they weren't wrong they talked to you like a
[1:10:54.400 --> 1:11:00.920]  lobotomized monkey a monkey that's had its cerebral cortex carved out is
[1:11:00.920 --> 1:11:07.320]  smarter than you it's not even smarter it wants to know you got to give it a
[1:11:07.320 --> 1:11:12.680]  banana for it to eat it you can give an American some dog dung and tell them
[1:11:12.680 --> 1:11:17.240]  it's a banana and they'll gobble it right up heard a local newscast they had
[1:11:17.240 --> 1:11:22.160]  some university professor saying that it's because of speculators that the
[1:11:22.160 --> 1:11:26.680]  oil let let me explain something to you the head of OPEC the oil companies all
[1:11:26.680 --> 1:11:33.080]  over the world it's the dollar being devalued Bloomberg but you'll never
[1:11:33.080 --> 1:11:40.880]  ever ever because the conventional baloney that everyone's meant to parrot
[1:11:40.880 --> 1:11:45.360]  so they sound wise and mighty most these people that parents the stuff aren't
[1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:52.560]  bad they just parrot whatever the big parrot says to feel official oh god I
[1:11:52.560 --> 1:11:55.480]  can't handle it anymore I said I'd take your calls but I'm gonna just finish this
[1:11:55.480 --> 1:12:00.360]  story then I will go to Ryan Illinois I want to hear from Alex in Florida says
[1:12:00.360 --> 1:12:05.320]  he's a reporter and got arrested whatever that is Steve Mike Willie Lynn Chuck
[1:12:05.320 --> 1:12:08.600]  we're gonna get to everybody I promise after break like I'm not gonna spend
[1:12:08.600 --> 1:12:12.360]  much time on this I could spend 10 hours but the government in hundreds of
[1:12:12.360 --> 1:12:15.800]  textbooks and government documents I've had former head of Department of
[1:12:15.800 --> 1:12:19.680]  Education policy on Charlotte-Israby wrote the book the Liberty numbing down I've
[1:12:19.680 --> 1:12:24.080]  had John Taylor Goddow award-winning educator work for the government he got
[1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:26.760]  the higher levels and found out they're dumbing you down on purpose
[1:12:26.760 --> 1:12:30.960]  everybody knows that but I mean we got the documents and they said a hundred
[1:12:30.960 --> 1:12:34.920]  years ago they were gonna turn you into people who couldn't think the teachers
[1:12:34.920 --> 1:12:38.400]  are three fours in a rations in they don't know their their brain dead monkeys
[1:12:38.400 --> 1:12:44.760]  too sitting there brain damaging with children government permission required
[1:12:44.760 --> 1:12:48.920]  for parents to kiss their children see this is the next thing they just say
[1:12:48.920 --> 1:12:52.880]  it's improper you may be arrested if you're seen hugging your child if a
[1:12:52.880 --> 1:12:56.560]  father takes a son or daughter or a mother takes them alone the pool you
[1:12:56.560 --> 1:13:00.880]  must be licensed to have children and you must be licensed to touch your
[1:13:00.880 --> 1:13:05.120]  children if you get a license before you can change your baby's diaper or if you
[1:13:05.120 --> 1:13:10.960]  were seen doing breastfeeding anything it is perverted and you will be arrested
[1:13:10.960 --> 1:13:16.960]  London Telegraph you cannot make this up it's now the law in England and it has
[1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:20.600]  all the cases here and they're now starting it in the US and I see Paul
[1:13:20.600 --> 1:13:24.080]  and others can't believe I know I can't believe it either who would believe
[1:13:24.080 --> 1:13:27.400]  that they put scanners now going in all the airports that show your neck and
[1:13:27.400 --> 1:13:31.600]  body and record it who would believe that in 2011 Ford and Toyota have
[1:13:31.600 --> 1:13:34.840]  announced all cars they make will have a I don't know they're gonna put it in but
[1:13:34.840 --> 1:13:38.440]  they say they are we may be able to stop it somebody watching this in three or
[1:13:38.440 --> 1:13:42.440]  four years but they say that all their new cars will have breathalyzers just
[1:13:42.440 --> 1:13:47.120]  Google it all guilty until proven innocent or face scanning cameras are in
[1:13:47.120 --> 1:13:52.320]  every city Pentagon controlled license scanning are everywhere when you come

[1:13:55.680 --> 1:14:00.120]  no fourth amendment and search it I mean you know fourth amendment it's just
[1:14:00.120 --> 1:14:06.280]  everything's a joke folks the government's rogue and criminal here it
[1:14:06.280 --> 1:14:11.160]  is government permission required for parents to kiss children quarter of
[1:14:11.160 --> 1:14:15.240]  adult population face mandatory anti pedophile test and sweeping expansion
[1:14:15.240 --> 1:14:20.000]  of child protection measures sweeping new policy set to be introduced in the
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:23.160]  UK will mandate parents to get government permission to kiss their
[1:14:23.160 --> 1:14:26.160]  children or take them to the swimming pool in public measures that are
[1:14:26.160 --> 1:14:29.200]  poisoning relationships between the generations according to respected
[1:14:29.200 --> 1:14:33.280]  sociologist professor Frank fruity by the way try I want him on the show and
[1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:37.840]  then we and then Paul did an article about the London story it was in several
[1:14:37.840 --> 1:14:41.440]  their papers London Telegraph and others and then that we found even worse
[1:14:41.440 --> 1:14:46.800]  stuff where they're doing it in the US starting where CPS take people's kids in
[1:14:46.800 --> 1:14:52.000]  the US if a mother sees is seen hugging their son or daughter when they leave
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:56.360]  school CPS then comes if you don't hand the child over SWAT teams will come and
[1:14:56.360 --> 1:15:01.720]  will gun you down you understand you will be murdered if you don't let the

[1:15:16.280 --> 1:15:20.560]  parents to kiss their children from next year the new independent safeguard
[1:15:20.560 --> 1:15:23.760]  authority will require any adult who comes in contact with children or
[1:15:23.760 --> 1:15:28.560]  vulnerable adults either their work or in voluntary groups to be vetted
[1:15:28.560 --> 1:15:32.920]  according to London Telegraph and it goes on in the think tank report
[1:15:32.920 --> 1:15:37.000]  professor fruity highlighted cases where government checks were already being
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:39.880]  required by schools and other organizations for parents to merely
[1:15:39.880 --> 1:15:43.080]  interact with their own children in public and one example a woman could
[1:15:43.080 --> 1:15:46.160]  not kiss her daughter goodbye at school trip because she had not been vetted
[1:15:46.160 --> 1:15:50.920]  with a license to touch their child and another in another fuel prices are at an

[1:24:08.480 --> 1:24:11.000]  then i read a few books years ago talk to some
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  telecom uh... people some computer experts
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:16.640]  then i got into some history books about
[1:24:16.640 --> 1:24:19.800]  thomas watching the uh... big nazi for hitler
[1:24:19.800 --> 1:24:22.800]  who created the machine for the people with the numbers on their arms
[1:24:22.800 --> 1:24:24.120]  i'd be a
[1:24:24.120 --> 1:24:28.320]  and then when he died in fifty four the company was to be a trust
[1:24:28.320 --> 1:24:31.520]  to carry out eugenics that's the whole point of i'd be a
[1:24:31.520 --> 1:24:34.000]  that making the money is just like
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:37.640]  warren buffett gave forty something forty seven billion free eugenics
[1:24:37.640 --> 1:24:40.720]  uh... the gates is gave uh... forty something billion free eugenics that's
[1:24:40.720 --> 1:24:42.000]  in my film in game
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:44.080]  we make all this money just to give it
[1:24:44.080 --> 1:24:45.560]  for eugenics you hear
[1:24:45.560 --> 1:24:47.320]  helping africans

[1:24:51.200 --> 1:24:53.120]  and yeah that we should sterilize people
[1:24:53.120 --> 1:24:54.920]  route have one child policies
[1:24:54.920 --> 1:24:56.760]  and he's a hardcore people
[1:24:56.760 --> 1:24:59.800]  but uh... i'd be almost set up during the trust busting
[1:24:59.800 --> 1:25:02.400]  in the early uh... you know turn the last century
[1:25:02.400 --> 1:25:06.680]  uh... new 1905 nineteen oh six are getting big and he saw the trust busting
[1:25:06.680 --> 1:25:08.440]  so to get around a monopoly
[1:25:08.440 --> 1:25:11.600]  they couldn't have the operating system and saw all the machines
[1:25:11.600 --> 1:25:14.920]  and so they have a lot and and and i'd be a specialized they have thousands of
[1:25:14.920 --> 1:25:16.280]  front companies

[1:34:54.560 --> 1:34:57.800]  in my pocket so everything that I'm about to tell you I've got and let me guess
[1:34:57.800 --> 1:35:00.760]  after they assaulted you they charged you with assault
[1:35:00.760 --> 1:35:04.600]  um actually my only charge was resisting arrest oh my god this is
[1:35:04.600 --> 1:35:09.400]  unprecedented okay and my car actually drops 24 hours later I never even saw
[1:35:09.400 --> 1:35:11.880]  a judge is that because they know there were other cameras shots of it were
[1:35:11.880 --> 1:35:15.080]  there are people cameras oh yes well that's only why you see they would have
[1:35:15.080 --> 1:35:18.440]  probably gone ahead and tasered each other he had a heart attack and had a
[1:35:18.440 --> 1:35:22.440]  high-five celebration that's been caught on tape and it framed you and there

[1:38:41.360 --> 1:38:46.320]  know we're all part of the same country Oceania and also to with another
[1:38:46.320 --> 1:38:50.000]  article from the linen telegraph saying that before you can drive another
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:54.640]  family's kids your your neighbor's kids to the soccer match you got to be a bit
[1:38:54.640 --> 1:38:57.960]  about the government yeah you're certified it's licensing family for the
[1:38:57.960 --> 1:39:02.840]  one-child policy and the government takeover of everything sure and those
[1:39:02.840 --> 1:39:08.600]  two stories sent me scurrying to this one website called or will today dot com
[1:39:08.600 --> 1:39:13.480]  which is very good it's not my website so I know I know it's not a canada and it
[1:39:13.480 --> 1:39:22.320]  takes today's headlines and and there's quotes from 1984 that that if I may
[1:39:22.320 --> 1:39:26.280]  read that kind of like this is what you do that in a minute but the point is the
[1:39:26.280 --> 1:39:31.120]  apparatus is worse than 1984 they're just not mass machine gunning us all or
[1:39:31.120 --> 1:39:35.160]  torturing us to death yet for actions but they're they're all gearing up
[1:39:35.160 --> 1:39:39.800]  over killing their tyranny before they lose it fully but yes I go ahead and
[1:39:39.800 --> 1:39:43.360]  I read the quotes yeah this is well in the frog routine okay here's the quote
[1:39:43.360 --> 1:39:48.680]  already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived before
[1:39:48.680 --> 1:39:54.360]  the revolution we have cut the links between child and parent and between man
[1:39:54.360 --> 1:40:00.040]  and man and between man and woman no one dares trust a wife or a child or a
[1:40:00.040 --> 1:40:05.600]  friend any longer but in the future there will be no wives and no friends
[1:40:05.600 --> 1:40:10.440]  children will be taken from their parents at birth as one takes eggs from a
[1:40:10.440 --> 1:40:16.000]  hen the sex instinct will be eradicated procreation will be animal
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:20.520]  formality now let me stop I'm gonna let you go back and read it all I have to
[1:40:20.520 --> 1:40:24.360]  hold you over I will I've read it before many times I'm thinking about making a
[1:40:24.360 --> 1:40:27.560]  film about it is the reason it's one of my specialties that I really want to
[1:40:27.560 --> 1:40:30.440]  talk about I'm glad you brought it up it's so precious well here's the deal
[1:40:30.440 --> 1:40:35.160]  people think that this is reality imitating art no Orwell was a secret
[1:40:35.160 --> 1:40:40.080]  member of the police in India then he was a member of the propaganda corps he
[1:40:40.080 --> 1:40:46.360]  fought in in in on the communist side in Spain against Franco then he worked for
[1:40:46.360 --> 1:40:51.280]  the BBC in propaganda so he was writing about what the Soviets were doing now
[1:40:51.280 --> 1:40:56.560]  US textbooks these are education textbooks for the educators say stuff
[1:40:56.560 --> 1:41:01.720]  worse and say they are to eradicate the family and that's what this is so I want
[1:41:01.720 --> 1:41:06.440]  people to know what you're hearing isn't as bad as what social workers are
[1:41:06.440 --> 1:41:11.960]  taught go ahead no yeah that was pretty much the quote and basically you know I
[1:41:11.960 --> 1:41:15.800]  used to think when I read 1984 in high school in 1970 I thought that was
[1:41:15.800 --> 1:41:20.760]  something way off in the distant future but really this has been ongoing for
[1:41:20.760 --> 1:41:25.240]  the past 40 or 50 years but it's just accelerating at an exponential rate and
[1:41:25.240 --> 1:41:30.560]  also too I want to say that it was a pleasure meeting you at Chantilly a
[1:41:30.560 --> 1:41:34.960]  few weeks ago I was sitting next to you when you're eating your pizza at the

[1:41:39.740 --> 1:41:45.000]  helping us cover Bilderberg but that's my point is this is art imitating life
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:50.960]  sure and and and and that's why you have to quit being gullible compliant
[1:41:50.960 --> 1:41:57.200]  slaves Americans you have to say no I will hug my child whenever I want you
[1:41:57.200 --> 1:42:03.680]  pedophile degenerate government scumbag sorry we have to stand up we can't

[1:47:03.080 --> 1:47:15.080]  it's the final segment be taking your phone calls here in just a moment for the
[1:47:15.080 --> 1:47:20.120]  last six months knowing the Supreme Court had already had their debate and
[1:47:20.120 --> 1:47:26.120]  ruled and then months later report on it I told you you would hear this I even
[1:47:26.120 --> 1:47:29.040]  said it last Monday days before it came out last Thursday I said you will hear
[1:47:29.040 --> 1:47:34.040]  big win for the second amendment court rules for the first time it's an
[1:47:34.040 --> 1:47:39.080]  individual right but does put some restrictions and what'd you hear what
[1:47:39.080 --> 1:47:44.160]  headlines did you read exactly what I said it would be because I know their
[1:47:44.160 --> 1:47:47.840]  tactics I know their mind and other operations the Federalist papers the
[1:47:47.840 --> 1:47:53.400]  anti-federalist papers every other major federal court ruling before the 1934
[1:47:53.400 --> 1:47:59.960]  appellate court rulings said it was an absolute unalienable un infringed
[1:47:59.960 --> 1:48:03.880]  absolute right against tyranny and the federal government it could not get
[1:48:03.880 --> 1:48:08.560]  involved in any way well here's the deceptive headlines Supreme Court says
[1:48:08.560 --> 1:48:13.240]  Americans have right to own guns but they have a right to license them restrict
[1:48:13.240 --> 1:48:17.920]  them make you get licenses and so basically now they have a tool to come
[1:48:17.920 --> 1:48:21.520]  after your guns the power to license is the power to tax and destroy kind of
[1:48:21.520 --> 1:48:24.400]  like New York 50 years ago said you just got to get a license then a few years
[1:48:24.400 --> 1:48:29.080]  later oh we don't offer the license you can't get it now that's how they do it
[1:48:29.080 --> 1:48:35.240]  a license is a right to do something is a permission to do something that would
[1:48:35.240 --> 1:48:45.760]  be illegal okay now I actually spent time reading over this is only part of
[1:48:45.760 --> 1:48:49.480]  the federal briefing on it and basically it's a treatise on massive gun
[1:48:49.480 --> 1:48:55.240]  control a reign of terror I interviewed two gun group heads Aaron Zelman just
[1:48:55.240 --> 1:48:58.720]  preservation farms ownership chairman and of course the chairman of Gunners
[1:48:58.720 --> 1:49:03.440]  of America Larry Pratt they both concurred that it is a massive attack on
[1:49:03.440 --> 1:49:08.440]  the Second Amendment but again we give you absolute information here and in
[1:49:08.440 --> 1:49:14.440]  facts instead of what you get everywhere else just a bunch of bull folks you've

[1:52:09.160 --> 1:52:13.360]  me an idea we have four sites bigger than the Dallas Morning News each one
[1:52:13.360 --> 1:52:18.080]  read it higher on Alexa that's right we are engaging the new world order at
[1:52:18.080 --> 1:52:23.440]  point blank range and we are explosively growing right now oh that brings me to
[1:52:23.440 --> 1:52:26.320]  the final subject that I'm going to jam in four phone calls in the last eight
[1:52:26.320 --> 1:52:32.960]  minutes a wiki leak and the government admits it's accurate once it taken down
[1:52:32.960 --> 1:52:38.560]  another army field manual on torture and control how to train death squads and
[1:52:38.560 --> 1:52:45.280]  crush revolutions from South Salvador to Iraq and in the army special forces
[1:52:45.280 --> 1:52:51.440]  manual it says psychological operations Cyop can support the mission by
[1:52:51.440 --> 1:52:55.760]  directing the insurgent forces to neutral groups creating dissension among
[1:52:55.760 --> 1:53:02.440]  the insurgents themselves and supporting de facto groups and it says divisive
[1:53:02.440 --> 1:53:09.120]  programs create dissension disorganization low morale subversion and
[1:53:09.120 --> 1:53:13.640]  detention and defection within the insurgent forces also important or
[1:53:13.640 --> 1:53:18.200]  national programs to win insurgents over so all these groups are attacking me
[1:53:18.200 --> 1:53:23.000]  right now claiming their patriots making stuff up lying and that's good the
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:26.240]  fact that I'm getting attacked literally by hundreds of sites hundreds of people a
[1:53:26.240 --> 1:53:29.880]  lot of them are weak-minded people that parrot what this info operatives are
[1:53:29.880 --> 1:53:33.320]  saying but we know operatives are honest I mean folks I got humid on me I'm
[1:53:33.320 --> 1:53:37.240]  followed around in Austin I mean it's unbelievable I people admit their
[1:53:37.240 --> 1:53:41.560]  government agents and threaten me that's good I mean we're exposing these
[1:53:41.560 --> 1:53:44.880]  terrorists and they don't like it we're gonna defend the republic we're the
[1:53:44.880 --> 1:53:47.920]  real Americans they're the anti-Americans a lot of good people in
[1:53:47.920 --> 1:53:50.240]  government are coming to our side I mean I have the heads of department of
[1:53:50.240 --> 1:53:53.840]  treasury and former top CIA section chiefs coming on my show saying the
[1:53:53.840 --> 1:53:57.440]  government carried out the attacks we are winning but you read that you see I
[1:53:57.440 --> 1:54:02.720]  don't create division I say move forward fight the new order be positive we can

[1:54:38.100 --> 1:54:42.000]  haven't been killed because they don't want to put an exclamation point after
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:44.760]  everything I've said they don't want to underline or highlight everything I've
[1:54:44.760 --> 1:54:47.800]  said they don't want to make me a martyred dummies I'm tired of hearing all
[1:54:47.800 --> 1:54:51.720]  day why are you still alive then I'm on a rampage through your calls Willie in

[1:54:58.480 --> 1:55:02.560]  talk to you on the reason I'm calling it today to discuss a dollar
[1:55:02.560 --> 1:55:07.680]  devaluation I guess most Americans I feel have never been through a
[1:55:07.680 --> 1:55:12.760]  devaluation so they don't know what to look for I myself have my grandmother
[1:55:12.760 --> 1:55:17.680]  who's 93 years old has lived to devaluation and the depression so she
[1:55:17.680 --> 1:55:22.520]  knows what to look for and for the last past 20 years or so she's been running
[1:55:22.520 --> 1:55:28.440]  and raving about about the economy here in America and of course everybody
[1:55:28.440 --> 1:55:32.480]  all the nets all the grandson and what I'm not part of like oh grandma you're
[1:55:32.480 --> 1:55:38.480]  you're being so no you don't know what you're talking about but I'm here to
[1:55:38.480 --> 1:55:48.200]  tell you she does and what I'm getting at basically is is that the inflation and
[1:55:48.200 --> 1:55:54.080]  though I'm losing my tractor the Mexico Central Bank was printing money that
[1:55:54.080 --> 1:55:59.200]  was never backed up by gold or silver that's right so your grandma or your
[1:55:59.200 --> 1:56:03.480]  mom's from Mexico then my grandmother yeah she's from Mexico yeah that and
[1:56:03.480 --> 1:56:07.160]  again the elites buy real things then they leave you holding the bag that's
[1:56:07.160 --> 1:56:11.520]  why a nation with three times the resources of the US is so poor and see
[1:56:11.520 --> 1:56:16.320]  now it's gonna happen to us folks well right right and and and where you try
