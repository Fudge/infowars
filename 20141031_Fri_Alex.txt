[00:00.000 --> 00:12.720]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[00:12.720 --> 00:17.520]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial commonwealth.
[00:17.520 --> 00:22.480]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown
[00:22.480 --> 00:23.480]  Dallas.
[00:23.480 --> 00:29.480]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shootings.
[00:29.480 --> 00:36.480]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[00:36.480 --> 00:43.480]  It was almost as if it were a planned influence, it's just pancake.
[00:43.480 --> 01:04.480]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:04.480 --> 01:22.480]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in America.
[01:22.480 --> 01:38.480]  But are we all just living and dying from what the central banks do?
[01:38.480 --> 01:54.480]  You're not funny, clown.
[01:54.480 --> 01:59.480]  I'll kill you all.
[01:59.480 --> 02:05.360]  Forty-two years ago, John Wayne Gacy, a former Democratic Party member and psychopathic clown
[02:05.360 --> 02:13.400]  known as Pogo the Clown, stalked Chicago, Illinois from 1972 until 1978, killing at
[02:13.400 --> 02:20.400]  least 33 young men.
[02:20.400 --> 02:25.720]  The latest rash of evil clowns was first spotted in September of 2013 in Northern Ireland in
[02:25.720 --> 02:28.360]  the seaside town of Carrick-Fergus.
[02:28.360 --> 02:33.040]  Two mysterious characters, one known as the Carrick Killer Clown and his sidekick caused
[02:33.040 --> 02:43.640]  a disturbance when they were seen acting suspiciously near a secondary school.
[02:43.640 --> 02:48.400]  That incident inspired more clown mischief in California and New York.
[02:48.400 --> 02:52.840]  An independent film company out of Staten Island, New York created what appears to be
[02:52.840 --> 02:55.520]  a promotional campaign that went viral.
[02:55.520 --> 02:59.760]  It began with people linked to the production company utilizing social media to create a
[02:59.760 --> 03:03.640]  panic that a creepy clown was stalking the community.
[03:03.640 --> 03:08.880]  That viral social media ploy has spawned worldwide attention due to the popularity of American
[03:08.880 --> 03:14.080]  Horror Story freak shows, twisty the clown, and the popularity of scare prank YouTube
[03:14.080 --> 03:29.960]  videos that have netted tens of millions of viewers.
[03:29.960 --> 03:34.240]  Teenagers in France and Spain are now copycatting the viral videos.
[03:34.240 --> 03:38.880]  More than a dozen French teenagers armed with pistols, knives, and baseball bats have been
[03:38.880 --> 03:41.120]  arrested for attacking people.
[03:41.120 --> 03:46.160]  One pedestrian in Montpellier, France was attacked by a killer clown wielding an iron
[03:46.160 --> 03:47.160]  bar.
[03:47.160 --> 03:51.880]  Now, Spain's Guihon Clown has arrived in the wee hours of the night.
[03:51.880 --> 03:55.560]  Spain has a youth unemployment rate of 56 percent.
[03:55.560 --> 04:01.240]  While France's youth unemployment rate is 26 percent, as the fabric of society is torn
[04:01.240 --> 04:06.960]  apart by corporate piracy and inadequate leadership, I would expect we will see a rise of killer
[04:06.960 --> 04:15.200]  clown attacks and the like by large portions of global society with nothing to lose.
[04:15.200 --> 04:25.880]  Teenagers in France were warned by the police not to take action against the killer clowns.
[04:25.880 --> 04:52.280]  As the killer clown phenomenon grows, so does the killer clown vigilante phenomenon.
[04:52.280 --> 05:03.560]  You can find more about these secret stories on our website at www.infowars.com.
[05:03.560 --> 05:06.800]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[05:06.800 --> 05:12.700]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[05:12.700 --> 05:18.380]  There's a place down in Tennessee with the made of diamond gusset jeans.
[05:18.380 --> 05:46.760]  We turned jeans inside out diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[05:46.760 --> 05:51.620]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride
[05:51.620 --> 05:53.460]  all day with confidence.
[05:53.460 --> 05:56.060]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[05:56.060 --> 06:00.860]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it, others don't.
[06:00.860 --> 06:01.860]  Another major health threat.
[06:01.860 --> 06:06.260]  This one in Toledo, Ohio where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink
[06:06.260 --> 06:07.260]  the water.
[06:07.260 --> 06:09.620]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[06:09.620 --> 06:15.300]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every
[06:15.300 --> 06:16.620]  single day?
[06:16.620 --> 06:19.620]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[06:19.620 --> 06:22.540]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[06:22.540 --> 06:24.580]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[06:24.580 --> 06:27.500]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[06:27.500 --> 06:33.440]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[06:33.440 --> 06:36.620]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[06:36.620 --> 06:39.820]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[06:39.820 --> 06:45.820]  The Pro Pure Pro 1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must have for every modern independently

[07:16.020 --> 07:21.020]  our original and revolutionary nascent iodine formula, coming from a deep earth crystal
[07:21.020 --> 07:23.580]  source that no other supplier has.
[07:23.580 --> 07:28.820]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[07:28.820 --> 07:34.300]  Not our iodine, it comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested
[07:34.300 --> 07:36.300]  and proven to be completely pure.

[08:05.140 --> 08:28.620]  I
[08:28.620 --> 08:56.900]  have
[08:56.900 --> 09:14.140]  I'm Alex Jones, this is a Breaking Ebola News Update.
[09:14.140 --> 09:18.020]  In a moment I'm going to break down some very important developments where the World Health
[09:18.020 --> 09:24.180]  Organization itself is now saying that the incubation period is not just 21 days but
[09:24.180 --> 09:27.180]  can be up to 41 days.
[09:27.180 --> 09:33.140]  This was announced today as it was also announced that they are releasing dozens and dozens
[09:33.140 --> 09:43.140]  of quarantine Americans who are around patient zero in Dallas only after 21 days of observation.
[09:43.140 --> 09:48.300]  And as more flights come into the United States from West Africa with people exhibiting signs
[09:48.300 --> 09:53.980]  of Ebola, it's clear that there is an attempt to whitewash and cover up exactly what's
[09:53.980 --> 09:54.980]  happening.
[09:54.980 --> 09:59.820]  But before we get into that, I want to just point out that infowars.com, the nightly news
[09:59.820 --> 10:05.580]  and everything we do here is about us trying to find out what's really happening.
[10:05.580 --> 10:11.740]  Not coming at you with a preset agenda or view like the control left or control right
[10:11.740 --> 10:13.580]  and the state run media does.
[10:13.580 --> 10:16.060]  I want to know what's really happening with Ebola.
[10:16.060 --> 10:20.340]  I want to know if there are things out there that could protect this country and protect
[10:20.340 --> 10:21.620]  my three children.
[10:21.620 --> 10:26.060]  This is you do, we're teleprompter free here, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:26.060 --> 10:30.960]  This is about really doing the analysis, really talking to a wide spectrum of experts and
[10:30.960 --> 10:33.220]  not trusting the system.
[10:33.220 --> 10:34.220]  And that's the good news.
[10:34.220 --> 10:37.020]  There are several polls out just this week.
[10:37.020 --> 10:43.220]  Public confidence in the CDC nose dives CBS News reports in a major poll.
[10:43.220 --> 10:49.060]  Another story, 64% believe America is out of control.
[10:49.060 --> 10:53.780]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, America is getting more and more out of control.
[10:53.780 --> 10:57.700]  But the good news is when African leaders come out and say that this Ebola could be
[10:57.700 --> 11:00.140]  weaponized, people really aren't laughing anymore.
[11:00.140 --> 11:04.940]  In fact, we have an article on infowars.com that has a BBC video in it.
[11:04.940 --> 11:11.980]  Secret project created weaponized Ebola in South Africa in the 1980s to be used against
[11:11.980 --> 11:15.700]  blacks to reduce their population.
[11:15.700 --> 11:20.340]  So the alternative media is now becoming the dominant media and we go out and source real
[11:20.340 --> 11:23.940]  facts and what's already admitted.
[11:23.940 --> 11:28.380]  And the system calls us conspiracy theorists and attacks us in publications every day
[11:28.380 --> 11:32.940]  and it has no effect other than boosting our credibility.
[11:32.940 --> 11:38.580]  The arrogant dying dinosaur media still thinks that demonizing us is effective.
[11:38.580 --> 11:40.060]  It's not, ladies and gentlemen.
[11:40.060 --> 11:45.980]  Alex Jones may sound crazy, but still has 300 million YouTube, well he had 300 million
[11:45.980 --> 11:51.580]  people that have watched him on YouTube and that sort of fringe, arch conservative, deeply
[11:51.580 --> 11:58.260]  I think racist strain is being tapped into at crazy profit by people in the media.
[11:58.260 --> 12:02.260]  Well it is and I think the point you just made is the key thing, at crazy profit, these
[12:02.260 --> 12:04.620]  folks are getting paid to be racist.
[12:04.620 --> 12:11.420]  Now shifting to the potentially bad news, the breaking info, CNN Today, UN Stafford
[12:11.420 --> 12:20.020]  dies of Ebola, monitoring ends for 43 in Texas, 43 people who came in contact with Ebola patient
[12:20.020 --> 12:25.100]  Thomas Eric Duncan are now officially cleared after not demonstrating any symptoms during
[12:25.100 --> 12:28.340]  a 21 day monitoring period.
[12:28.340 --> 12:33.000]  Here's the problem, the UN on its own World Health Organization website and other main
[12:33.000 --> 12:40.340]  line virology sites state the same fact, say that Ebola can easily live for 41 days in
[12:40.340 --> 12:45.060]  the body and 70 days in the semen in a man's testicles.
[12:45.060 --> 12:49.700]  So they are releasing people who are around this Ebola patient and he's already infected
[12:49.700 --> 12:56.220]  two nurses who could not exhibit signs for another 21 days.
[12:56.220 --> 13:00.100]  And this fits into the pattern of bringing in the West African flights when other nations
[13:00.100 --> 13:06.540]  ban it, when they're putting Ebola patients in regular hospitals and the CDC told one
[13:06.540 --> 13:10.260]  of the nurses, doesn't matter if you're treating an Ebola patient and you've got fever, go
[13:10.260 --> 13:16.700]  ahead and fly honey, this is part of a pattern of trying to let Ebola get a foothold in this
[13:16.700 --> 13:23.700]  country so the CDC FEMA and Northcom can engage in a giant domestic power grab of medical
[13:23.700 --> 13:24.700]  tyranny.
[13:24.700 --> 13:30.060]  The feds have been buying millions of firearms, billions of bullets and other forms of ammunition
[13:30.060 --> 13:34.380]  they've been buying huge armored vehicles and deploying them in every city and digging
[13:34.380 --> 13:36.900]  in for biological catastrophe.
[13:36.900 --> 13:43.220]  I don't know if this Ebola event is that, what I do know is they're making preparations
[13:43.220 --> 13:47.660]  while telling us that we shouldn't be prepared, just like they tell us we shouldn't own guns
[13:47.660 --> 13:52.540]  even though the highest crime rates are in Chicago, New York and D.C. where they have
[13:52.540 --> 13:55.820]  an abolition of the individual's right to keep their arms.
[13:55.820 --> 13:57.860]  Well I personally am getting prepared.
[13:57.860 --> 14:02.540]  I saw them take the guns in Katrina and raid the houses of people that had their own solar
[14:02.540 --> 14:04.500]  power and were high and dry.
[14:04.500 --> 14:09.060]  I witnessed people a few years ago with a hurricane that hit the east coast begging
[14:09.060 --> 14:15.380]  for FEMA to help them and getting zero help for week after week after week and who could
[14:15.380 --> 14:20.780]  forget that famous sign that FEMA hung on their door saying we're closed because of
[14:20.780 --> 14:22.220]  bad weather.
[14:22.220 --> 14:27.660]  I'm not sitting back waiting for the government to come protect me and take care of me.
[14:27.660 --> 14:34.100]  They've shown time and time again they have very bad intent and bad will against the people.
[14:34.100 --> 14:35.100]  Not good will.
[14:35.100 --> 14:39.700]  They want crises to get out of control so they can pose as the saviors and sell their
[14:39.700 --> 14:43.340]  toxic vaccines and other poisons as a solution.
[14:43.340 --> 14:49.420]  Well I'm personally getting my body ready with plenty of sunshine, organic food, purified
[14:49.420 --> 14:50.420]  water.
[14:50.420 --> 14:56.500]  Myself and my family are taking high quality colloidal silver from InfoWarsLife.com, the
[14:56.500 --> 14:57.500]  Silver Bullet.
[14:57.500 --> 15:03.500]  I'm taking Survival Shield X2, true nascent iodine that I believe is even more important
[15:03.500 --> 15:07.740]  than things like loyal silver because if you don't have iodine in your body, if you're
[15:07.740 --> 15:10.060]  deficient in it, you will die.
[15:10.060 --> 15:15.060]  It's something you've got to absolutely have so governments keep lowering and lowering
[15:15.060 --> 15:17.740]  the allowance they claim that we need.
[15:17.740 --> 15:19.820]  This needs to be looked into, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:19.820 --> 15:21.180]  We've been investigating it.
[15:21.180 --> 15:26.140]  It's why I'm doing everything I can to boost my body's natural defenses and why I'm trying
[15:26.140 --> 15:30.500]  to warn people that they can't have confidence in the system, but at the same time we shouldn't
[15:30.500 --> 15:34.060]  just sit here and wait for things to spiral out of control.
[15:34.060 --> 15:37.820]  None of this in the final equation is a silver bullet.
[15:37.820 --> 15:42.980]  Nothing is perfect, but just laying there and being horrified and watching mainstream
[15:42.980 --> 15:47.140]  media deceive us and scare us is not going to do a damn thing.
[15:47.140 --> 15:51.060]  We all need to get involved and do our own research.
[15:51.060 --> 15:56.980]  So don't stand behind us, stand right beside us, looking at every angle of this, researching
[15:56.980 --> 16:02.020]  what's really happening and understanding that there is clearly a cover-up going on
[16:02.020 --> 16:03.740]  with this Ebola situation.
[16:03.740 --> 16:07.820]  Now I've said many times, I don't think this Ebola will probably really get out of hand
[16:07.820 --> 16:09.860]  here in the United States.
[16:09.860 --> 16:12.700]  Even if the feds try everything they can to let it spread.
[16:12.700 --> 16:17.780]  But in Africa, the UN is saying it could be up to 1.4 million people or more that end
[16:17.780 --> 16:19.140]  up getting it.
[16:19.140 --> 16:22.140]  That is just an incredible number.
[16:22.140 --> 16:26.580]  What I'm really concerned about is the MRSA and the drug-resistant bacteria and the drug
[16:26.580 --> 16:32.460]  immune TB that is spreading across this country, the flesh-eating bacteria.
[16:32.460 --> 16:37.500]  That's why it's essential for all of us going into this flu season to do our own research
[16:37.500 --> 16:44.140]  and find out that the H1N1 shot five years ago lowered people's immune systems and doubled
[16:44.140 --> 16:48.780]  their chances of getting the regular flu that was the big killer.
[16:48.780 --> 16:55.020]  That's why it's vital going into this winter that we all wash our hands and boost our immune
[16:55.020 --> 16:57.980]  systems however we can naturally.
[16:57.980 --> 17:02.180]  Well that's it for this emergency Ebola news update alert.
[17:02.180 --> 17:06.660]  I'm Alex Jones signing off for this edition of InfoWars Nightly News.
[17:06.660 --> 17:11.620]  We don't have all the answers, but we know the feds and the globalists and the UN, the
[17:11.620 --> 17:16.180]  people caught doing secret lethal medical testing all over the world.
[17:16.180 --> 17:20.380]  We know that that's a group that we are certainly going to keep an eye on.
[17:20.380 --> 17:22.620]  All right, that's Alex Jones' special report.
[17:22.620 --> 17:26.940]  I'm David Knight on this October 31, 2014 edition.
[17:26.940 --> 17:30.380]  This is Halloween and Alex is going to be joining us live.
[17:30.380 --> 17:35.260]  We had a report at the very beginning of the show, John Bowne's Killer Clowns Report.
[17:35.260 --> 17:37.140]  If you haven't seen that, you need to see that.
[17:37.140 --> 17:40.460]  It's got some great visuals in it and it's up on our YouTube channel now.
[17:40.460 --> 17:45.500]  Of course, this is Halloween and I knew that this clown thing with the French in their
[17:45.500 --> 17:49.060]  minds is going to break bad, but this is getting out of hand in France.
[17:49.060 --> 17:52.620]  Of course, there's a lot of other things behind that and John breaks that down.
[17:52.620 --> 17:55.420]  Now we also have up on the Drudge Report.
[17:55.420 --> 18:01.100]  One of our contest entrants actually made the paper in Illinois.
[18:01.100 --> 18:05.620]  They didn't report the fact that it was an InfoWars contest, but the man going around
[18:05.620 --> 18:10.980]  in a hazmat suit and an Obama mask hanging Ebola posters made the local news and that
[18:10.980 --> 18:12.100]  made Drudge Report.
[18:12.100 --> 18:18.580]  So that's up on the Drudge Report, a man in Obama mask and a hazmat suit hangs Ebola posters
[18:18.580 --> 18:19.580]  across Chicago.
[18:19.580 --> 18:22.780]  And of course, we have other breaking Ebola news.
[18:22.780 --> 18:27.980]  They are now scrubbed the information about how you can catch the Ebola from coughing and
[18:27.980 --> 18:30.300]  sneezing with the aerosol particles.
[18:30.300 --> 18:32.100]  That was up on the CDC website.
[18:32.100 --> 18:34.180]  That's now been scrubbed.
[18:34.180 --> 18:36.140]  They keep changing that information.
[18:36.140 --> 18:42.060]  They want to make sure that we don't have a panic, but this is going far, far beyond
[18:42.060 --> 18:43.060]  that.
[18:43.060 --> 18:48.020]  As a matter of fact, just look at this nurse who yesterday went for a ride in defiance
[18:48.020 --> 18:53.260]  of people's wishes and the request of the main governor that she stay away from the
[18:53.260 --> 18:54.260]  public.
[18:54.260 --> 18:57.700]  She went for a bicycle ride and she did that in defiance, and they didn't have a court
[18:57.700 --> 18:58.940]  order at the time.
[18:58.940 --> 19:02.860]  Now they do have a court order to keep her from doing that.
[19:02.860 --> 19:08.100]  Now I think it's really amazing that a doctor, that a nurse would do this type of thing.
[19:08.100 --> 19:12.820]  But of course, she also doesn't just have connections to Doctors Without Borders, which
[19:12.820 --> 19:18.540]  we just had a Doctor Without Borders doctor who had Ebola, who lied about the fact that
[19:18.540 --> 19:22.460]  he went around New York until they found his credit card records.
[19:22.460 --> 19:23.900]  He did not do self-quarantine.
[19:23.900 --> 19:26.020]  He did not put other people's interests first.
[19:26.020 --> 19:31.020]  He did not follow the maxim that doctors are supposed to follow first, do no harm.
[19:31.020 --> 19:33.020]  And of course, neither is she.
[19:33.020 --> 19:39.380]  She has deep ties to the CDC and we see with her that voluntary quarantine is not going
[19:39.380 --> 19:40.380]  to work.
[19:40.380 --> 19:45.100]  Why would she model this kind of dangerous behavior, the same questions that we had about
[19:45.100 --> 19:46.940]  Judge Jenkins in Dallas?
[19:46.940 --> 19:47.940]  Stay with us.
[19:47.940 --> 19:48.940]  Alex Jones is going to be live.
[19:48.940 --> 20:00.940]  We'll be right back.
[20:00.940 --> 20:30.780]  We'll see you next time.
[20:30.780 --> 20:33.820]  In today's unstable environment, self-protection is critical.
[20:33.820 --> 20:38.380]  Civil unrest, riots, looting, it's happening now right here in the United States and your
[20:38.380 --> 20:39.740]  rights are at risk.
[20:39.740 --> 20:44.180]  If passed, HR-5344 would ban level 3 and above body armor.
[20:44.180 --> 20:46.300]  Katie Armor is standing up for you.
[20:46.300 --> 20:49.380]  We offer the most affordable level 3 body armor on the market.
[20:49.380 --> 20:53.900]  Katie, level 3 armor, withstands pistol and rifle hits up to 7.62 NATO.

[21:59.340 --> 22:04.500]  On September 30, 2014, the first confirmed case of Ebola appeared in the U.S. This combined
[22:04.500 --> 22:09.620]  with several other unidentified viruses have some of our customers at 30dayfoodsupply.com
[22:09.620 --> 22:15.500]  concerned about the safety of our domestic food supply, resulting in a surge of our $99.90
[22:15.500 --> 22:16.500]  serving kits.
[22:16.500 --> 22:22.420]  While we at 30dayfoodsupply.com have no expertise in epidemiology, we are aggressively purchasing
[22:22.420 --> 22:27.180]  raw materials that are currently in stock and we intend to continue to sell our 30-day

[23:01.180 --> 23:02.180]  Those we should be able to depend on, let us down.
[23:02.180 --> 23:14.180]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way.
[23:14.180 --> 23:17.300]  Well, the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[23:17.300 --> 23:19.780]  Don't depend on the government to save you.

[23:42.660 --> 23:47.260]  We are hurting down here and we need help immediately.
[23:47.260 --> 23:51.580]  Before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.
[23:51.580 --> 23:54.340]  Mypatriotsupply.com.
[23:54.340 --> 24:18.340]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded, everybody rolls with their fingers crossed,
[24:18.340 --> 24:24.300]  everybody knows the war is over, everybody knows.
[24:24.300 --> 24:30.020]  Well, it's all St. Stephen, I guess they call it Halloween, showin', Sam Hain, one of the
[24:30.020 --> 24:32.300]  different names for it.
[24:32.300 --> 24:39.180]  The big occult holiday is upon us and we're seeing all sorts of good things happening,
[24:39.180 --> 24:42.220]  all sorts of bad things happening, obviously.
[24:42.220 --> 24:46.460]  I had a family issue I had to deal with so I'm here a little bit late.
[24:46.460 --> 24:50.460]  I was actually here once the show started but had to get ready.
[24:50.460 --> 24:52.460]  Appreciate David Knight filling in for me.
[24:52.460 --> 24:57.420]  Again, I'm your host Alex Jones and of course we also had some special reports that we premiered
[24:57.420 --> 24:58.660]  here.
[24:58.660 --> 25:04.580]  We have a lengthy special report that's about 20 minutes long that Rob do did that will air
[25:04.580 --> 25:09.380]  today if we have time dealing with what's worse, what's more poisonous than the Halloween
[25:09.380 --> 25:14.620]  candy with the high fructose corn syrup filled with lead and mercury and more.
[25:14.620 --> 25:15.620]  So that's coming up.
[25:15.620 --> 25:23.460]  We also have Dr. Joseph Merkola, he's a medical doctor, but one of the leading, if not the
[25:23.460 --> 25:28.540]  leading voice out there, exposing what's happening with big pharma and more.
[25:28.540 --> 25:33.620]  He's going to give us his real take on the Ebola situation in the third hour today.
[25:33.620 --> 25:38.020]  We're going to cover a lot of other news obviously in the meantime.
[25:38.020 --> 25:43.820]  It was two, three days ago back on October 29th that listeners sent us a link to the
[25:43.820 --> 25:49.940]  CDC's website showing that the last month they have gone from saying Ebola couldn't
[25:49.940 --> 25:53.460]  be airborne to saying it could be airborne.
[25:53.460 --> 25:57.940]  And then the New York Post and others picked it up within a few hours.
[25:57.940 --> 26:03.940]  So now Gateway Pundits reporting today, CDC deletes Ebola page on how you can catch disease
[26:03.940 --> 26:06.860]  from coughing and sneezing.
[26:06.860 --> 26:11.460]  The Army's own manuals, the CDC, the World Health Organization, they're all on record
[26:11.460 --> 26:21.700]  saying it can travel three to 20 feet in hot weather, but that if it gets into cold weather,
[26:21.700 --> 26:28.340]  it can live weeks on surfaces, weeks and travel miles.
[26:28.340 --> 26:29.860]  So that's the truth.
[26:29.860 --> 26:35.100]  And if you, that's why people that have done research, the virologists, the epidemiologists,
[26:35.100 --> 26:39.820]  the experts we've had on, and I've done my own layman research of the medical reports
[26:39.820 --> 26:49.660]  out there because I've got three children, that if you get this flu season going with
[26:49.660 --> 26:55.300]  a bunch of compromised immune systems, that's why flu season is in the winter because the
[26:55.300 --> 27:00.220]  virus can live longer in the cold just like Ebola.
[27:00.220 --> 27:03.340]  And people aren't getting the sun so their immune systems aren't up and they're all
[27:03.340 --> 27:05.860]  cooped up inside.
[27:05.860 --> 27:08.940]  And you run out of vitamin D because you're not in the sun, within about two months of
[27:08.940 --> 27:16.180]  not having sun, and boom, you don't have vitamin D, you don't have vitamin B12, you get the
[27:16.180 --> 27:17.180]  flu.
[27:17.180 --> 27:24.500]  Well, if Ebola gets into the U.S. and starts spreading during the flu season, then you'll
[27:24.500 --> 27:29.020]  have people incubating it who don't know they have it, walking around for 40 plus days,
[27:29.020 --> 27:38.300]  it's now 40 plus days, not 21 in some cases, and it will spread very rapidly.
[27:38.300 --> 27:39.300]  That's why I'm concerned.
[27:39.300 --> 27:43.980]  Then you add the government lying about the whole thing and doing everything they can,
[27:43.980 --> 27:50.940]  like we reported last week in that special report you heard earlier.
[27:50.940 --> 27:56.820]  If you add into that equation the cold weather and the rest of it and the government not
[27:56.820 --> 28:02.780]  responding properly and violating their own default to screen people at the border to
[28:02.780 --> 28:07.660]  shut down the visas from West Africa, something all the African countries have done, something
[28:07.660 --> 28:11.340]  Europe has done, something the Middle East has done, something Asia has done, something
[28:11.340 --> 28:15.860]  Australia has done, something Columbia has done, something a bunch of Caribbean islands
[28:15.860 --> 28:18.820]  have done.
[28:18.820 --> 28:23.220]  You know why those Caribbean islands, the ones that have put the travel ban on, they're
[28:23.220 --> 28:30.420]  mainly black islands and black folks know AIDS and Ebola is race specific.
[28:30.420 --> 28:35.780]  So Caribbean islands run by black people are shutting down people coming in out of West
[28:35.780 --> 28:40.980]  Africa and it's not because they don't like black people, it's because they don't want
[28:40.980 --> 28:42.700]  to die.
[28:42.700 --> 28:47.860]  Now Ebola can kill white people, but it clearly, and I've had medical doctors on and scientists
[28:47.860 --> 28:54.100]  and former CIA and bio weapons treaty authors, it is race specific.
[28:54.100 --> 28:58.700]  We can say that and we can air a BBC, you know, a documentary that Ireland BBC was declassified
[28:58.700 --> 29:08.660]  in the mid 90s that South Africa created airborne race specific Ebola for Africans and our own
[29:08.660 --> 29:14.060]  Pentagon had to kill a bunch of monkeys in 89 where airborne Ebola started spreading
[29:14.060 --> 29:16.940]  in Virginia.
[29:16.940 --> 29:23.460]  Do I need to air the NOVA special again or the BBC piece again because mainstream media
[29:23.460 --> 29:26.500]  attacks us and says we're making this up, we're not making any of this up.
[29:26.500 --> 29:29.780]  We're just preying on people's ignorance, well here's the problem, people aren't as
[29:29.780 --> 29:30.780]  ignorant as they used to be.
[29:30.780 --> 29:35.620]  So coming up, the layoffs on Ebola quickly, then early voting, Drudge reports, Republicans
[29:35.620 --> 29:37.620]  have a 10% lead.
[29:37.620 --> 29:41.820]  We're going to be looking today and Sunday and then next week at how many of these are
[29:41.820 --> 29:47.620]  good libertarian style Republicans and how many are neocon, rhino Republicans.
[29:47.620 --> 29:49.860]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[29:49.860 --> 30:01.220]  Here on the March, the Empire's on the Run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.220 --> 30:06.140]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around
[30:06.140 --> 30:11.780]  the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here with key ingredients
[30:11.780 --> 30:13.700]  backed by real clinical studies.
[30:13.700 --> 30:18.300]  The new oxy powder available through Info Wars Life was invented during Dr. Group's
[30:18.300 --> 30:20.820]  research on the toxification of our bodies.
[30:20.820 --> 30:25.300]  Many herbal, colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially
[30:25.300 --> 30:31.020]  dangerous ingredients, often times full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[30:31.020 --> 30:35.860]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[30:35.860 --> 30:40.660]  Oxy powder does not require time off work and there's no need for bad taste and concoctions.
[30:40.660 --> 30:46.980]  Instead, oxy powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[30:46.980 --> 30:53.820]  With the astonishing cleansing power of super oxide and ozonide technology, go to infowarslife.com
[30:53.820 --> 31:01.380]  or infowarsstore.com to get started with oxy powder or call 1-888-253-3139.
[31:01.380 --> 31:05.060]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[31:05.060 --> 31:09.420]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[31:09.420 --> 31:11.460]  Can you put two and two together?
[31:11.460 --> 31:16.420]  Infidel body armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds.
[31:16.420 --> 31:20.140]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal, but for how long?
[31:20.140 --> 31:27.100]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor.com.
[31:27.100 --> 31:30.980]  Infidel body armor just won't quit.
[31:30.980 --> 31:35.380]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed
[31:35.380 --> 31:41.820]  what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[31:41.820 --> 31:47.900]  Super male vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[31:47.900 --> 31:50.500]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[31:50.500 --> 31:53.420]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.

[31:59.420 --> 32:00.420]  from InfoWarsLife.
[32:00.420 --> 32:02.420]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[32:02.420 --> 32:07.100]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[32:07.100 --> 32:11.760]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[32:11.760 --> 32:16.900]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve
[32:16.900 --> 32:18.940]  growth and rejuvenation.
[32:18.940 --> 32:24.260]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth
[32:24.260 --> 32:28.180]  factors and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[32:28.180 --> 32:31.780]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA force.
[32:31.780 --> 32:39.700]  Each one of the key compounds, BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed
[32:39.700 --> 32:41.340]  listed published studies.
[32:41.340 --> 32:43.900]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[32:58.300 --> 32:59.300]  from InfoWarsLife.
[32:59.300 --> 33:23.460]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[33:23.460 --> 33:30.460]  the InfoWars.
[33:30.460 --> 33:33.060]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[33:33.060 --> 33:40.860]  I will be here this Sunday live, 4 to 6 p.m. central time as well as we go into election
[33:40.860 --> 33:45.980]  2014, one of the most political elections we've ever seen, one of the dirtiest elections
[33:45.980 --> 33:51.340]  we've ever seen, incredible race baiting going on and one of the most critically important
[33:51.340 --> 33:54.780]  we've ever seen, because even if a lot of these Republicans that are about to be voted
[33:54.780 --> 34:01.180]  in are globalist, the amount of anger and the major political realignment that this
[34:01.180 --> 34:08.460]  signifies with early voting numbers coming out showing Republicans have a 10% lead, that's
[34:08.460 --> 34:09.460]  a big deal.
[34:09.460 --> 34:13.620]  We're going to be breaking that down coming up here in just a few minutes.
[34:13.620 --> 34:17.700]  First off though, I don't want her within three feet of anyone governor threatens to
[34:17.700 --> 34:26.420]  arrest a Bola nurse after she defied quarantine to go for a bike ride and order pizza.
[34:26.420 --> 34:30.940]  So they're arresting people that defy quarantine in Africa.
[34:30.940 --> 34:34.260]  They're not bringing people into other African countries that have treated Ebola patients
[34:34.260 --> 34:40.940]  or who have it until they pass quarantine, but here we can't do that.
[34:40.940 --> 34:46.380]  And this nurse who turns out worked for the CDC is so arrogant and going on the news via
[34:46.380 --> 34:52.500]  Skype all over the place saying she'll do whatever she wants.
[34:52.500 --> 34:56.660]  What happens when other people come in contact with Ebola patients and perhaps have it and
[34:56.660 --> 34:58.340]  then they decide to just run around?
[34:58.340 --> 35:03.140]  Why did this other nurse in Dallas treating Ebola patients gets sick and call the CDC and
[35:03.140 --> 35:05.100]  they said go ahead and fly?
[35:05.100 --> 35:08.740]  And then she had Ebola and Lord knows what she did on that airplane.
[35:08.740 --> 35:11.580]  The stuff spreads through the air.
[35:11.580 --> 35:17.100]  The CDC admits that, national news pointed it out, so they pulled that off their website
[35:17.100 --> 35:19.540]  today.
[35:19.540 --> 35:23.420]  Main governor vows to use full extent of authority on Ebola nurse.
[35:23.420 --> 35:29.460]  Main governor LaPage vowed last night to use the full extent of his authority to response
[35:29.460 --> 35:34.860]  to a nurse who has treated Ebola patients sincerely on after she left her home in Maine
[35:34.860 --> 35:39.500]  and took a bicycle ride despite a quarantine order.
[35:39.500 --> 35:45.900]  LaPage and his office had been in talks overnight Wednesday to work out a legal deal for the
[35:45.900 --> 35:50.220]  nurse who has tested negative for Ebola.
[35:50.220 --> 35:54.340]  Will spend the remaining time until November 10th, the period that the state has ordered
[35:54.340 --> 36:05.100]  her to remain at her home as she waits out the virus, minimum 21 day incubation period.
[36:05.100 --> 36:12.180]  Here's another headline out of France 24, flu or Ebola, U.S. hospitals prepare for a confusing
[36:12.180 --> 36:13.180]  season.
[36:13.180 --> 36:15.140]  Yes, this is what's going to add to the panic.
[36:15.140 --> 36:21.020]  And then we have the confirmed reports from doctors and border patrol that people are
[36:21.020 --> 36:23.780]  being disappeared that appear to have Ebola.
[36:23.780 --> 36:28.140]  We don't know they have Ebola, what we know is they are being disappeared, the hospitals
[36:28.140 --> 36:33.180]  that we fingered will not respond, will not deny.
[36:33.180 --> 36:34.180]  What's that tell you?
[36:34.180 --> 36:37.740]  And we talked to the doctor that blew the whistle up in Missouri.
[36:37.740 --> 36:42.900]  He talks to the doctors at the nurses there at the Harry Truman Center and they go, no,
[36:42.900 --> 36:43.900]  it's all true.
[36:43.900 --> 36:45.740]  You're absolutely right, but we're scared.
[36:45.740 --> 36:50.180]  And then at the hospitals that he runs, he's been totally ostracized.
[36:50.180 --> 36:53.620]  Doctors nurses won't even talk to him.
[36:53.620 --> 36:57.740]  All because he did his Hippocratic oath and said, hey, they're disappearing people in
[36:57.740 --> 36:59.420]  the middle of the night.
[36:59.420 --> 37:04.700]  And then we confirmed it from a major Dallas doctor.
[37:04.700 --> 37:10.380]  You add to that our exclusive story that a major shipping company is delivering with
[37:10.380 --> 37:19.260]  18 wheelers as we speak from their cash on the East Coast, a quarter million thousand
[37:19.260 --> 37:26.300]  plus dollar hazmat suits to the DFW area Dallas, Fort Worth area.
[37:26.300 --> 37:35.380]  Quarter million, quarter million, and they admit they've ordered over a million total.
[37:35.380 --> 37:40.660]  And then Obama comes out yesterday and we played the clip twice and says there may be
[37:40.660 --> 37:42.660]  more Ebola cases.
[37:42.660 --> 37:44.420]  Just get ready for that.
[37:44.420 --> 37:48.340]  So they're waiting to laugh at the election to announce more Ebola cases.
[37:48.340 --> 37:55.940]  I think it's overwhelmingly clear or they may be able to cover it up with the people
[37:55.940 --> 37:58.180]  they've been snatching.
[37:58.180 --> 38:04.700]  But regardless of this being real Ebola or panicking by the government, it should be
[38:04.700 --> 38:08.380]  a news item that people are disappearing.
[38:08.380 --> 38:10.500]  That's the kind of thing you get a Pulitzer prize for.
[38:10.500 --> 38:11.660]  Where's the New York Times?
[38:11.660 --> 38:13.060]  Where's the Washington Post?
[38:13.060 --> 38:17.460]  Well, the fire departments, the police departments around the country were told two months ago,
[38:17.460 --> 38:21.060]  do not use the word Ebola over the radio.
[38:21.060 --> 38:24.060]  Hospitals were told don't tell anybody if there's an Ebola case.
[38:24.060 --> 38:26.460]  So see, that's how the secrecy begins.
[38:26.460 --> 38:31.660]  And then, oh, don't tell anybody, we bring in Ebola patient here.
[38:31.660 --> 38:38.300]  And then the CDC puts out on their website, oh yes, it is airborne up to three feet.
[38:38.300 --> 38:40.580]  They take that down.
[38:40.580 --> 38:42.700]  So what you have is a cover-up.
[38:42.700 --> 38:46.340]  We know cover-ups going on, we know some of what they're covering up, but we're about
[38:46.340 --> 38:47.340]  an inch deep.
[38:47.340 --> 38:52.060]  And what I think is a very, very deep reservoir that we have to swim down to the bottom up
[38:52.060 --> 38:55.500]  to find out what's happening.
[38:55.500 --> 38:59.900]  And I never claimed that we were the total cutting edge of so-called journalism.
[38:59.900 --> 39:05.300]  What I do is just go off research analysis and what's already known, what is publicly
[39:05.300 --> 39:08.540]  available public intelligence.
[39:08.540 --> 39:13.460]  Meanwhile, Breitbart's reporting, Spanish intelligence has intercepted a plot to weaponize
[39:13.460 --> 39:14.460]  Ebola.
[39:14.460 --> 39:16.740]  Well, no kidding.
[39:16.740 --> 39:20.180]  I mean, what do you think ISIS and others are going to do?
[39:20.180 --> 39:23.620]  They're going to try to go into hospitals where people have Ebola, or they're going
[39:23.620 --> 39:29.580]  to try to go to these African countries, get sick, start incubating, and get on airplanes.
[39:29.580 --> 39:35.140]  But they don't need to because we have the doctor in New York, we now, the police have
[39:35.140 --> 39:39.380]  said he's a liar, and that he did get on the subway in the most busy time of day.
[39:39.380 --> 39:42.700]  And he went to restaurants and bowling alleys and taxi cabs.
[39:42.700 --> 39:49.420]  Gee, oh, by the way, when he was sick, you're a medical doctor, you come back from doctors
[39:49.420 --> 39:53.340]  without borders and on the CIA front, they do some real work, some of the doctors and
[39:53.340 --> 39:56.500]  their aren't agents.
[39:56.500 --> 40:04.620]  And he returns back and then just starts racing around everywhere he can when he has a fever.
[40:04.620 --> 40:08.820]  And now they say he's moved into stage two, that's the bleeding and the rest of it.
[40:08.820 --> 40:13.740]  Ebola doctor lied about New York City travels, New York Post.
[40:13.740 --> 40:15.260]  That's according to the NYPD.
[40:15.260 --> 40:19.580]  So we're seeing a real pattern here of these nurses and doctors just running around doing
[40:19.580 --> 40:20.700]  whatever they want.
[40:20.700 --> 40:23.620]  Is there one nurse that isn't running around?
[40:23.620 --> 40:27.660]  Is there one doctor that isn't running around?
[40:27.660 --> 40:32.100]  Will we catch one of these doctors next to the playground spitting on the monkey bars
[40:32.100 --> 40:36.820]  where kids are swinging?
[40:36.820 --> 40:43.900]  It seems like they're going over the top to spread this.
[40:43.900 --> 40:45.340]  Or maybe they just don't care.
[40:45.340 --> 40:46.620]  Maybe they're just stupid.
[40:46.620 --> 40:48.820]  Maybe they're just dumb.
[40:48.820 --> 40:50.860]  Or maybe they're not really sick.
[40:50.860 --> 40:51.860]  Maybe this is a Psyop.
[40:51.860 --> 40:55.500]  I mean, there's real Ebola in Africa, clearly it's a real disease.
[40:55.500 --> 41:01.740]  Clearly there's mystery illnesses with hundreds of kids dying every month now, tens of hundreds
[41:01.740 --> 41:07.340]  on respirators, just all sorts of bizarre deaths all over the place.
[41:07.340 --> 41:12.380]  And the media is so controlled, like the three monkeys, see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing,
[41:12.380 --> 41:14.820]  pretty much anything could go on.
[41:14.820 --> 41:19.300]  That's when I got concerned in January of this year, when in the two month period I'd
[41:19.300 --> 41:25.300]  lost three family members, and the doctors and nurses at the big medical center there
[41:25.300 --> 41:34.100]  in Tyler, Texas were telling me, no, it's some kind of mystery illness, it's a combination
[41:34.100 --> 41:39.580]  of resistant viruses and just regular bacteria that just can't be killed and all sorts of
[41:39.580 --> 41:43.780]  other weird stuff, and it's a cocktail, and there are just people dying all over the place,
[41:43.780 --> 41:46.500]  and we can't take more people, and all the other hospitals can't name more people, and
[41:46.500 --> 41:51.380]  you'd find little local news articles here and there around the country.
[41:51.380 --> 41:55.180]  Mystery illness causes four deaths at the hospital this week, next week.
[41:55.180 --> 41:58.220]  Mystery illness claims 10 more.
[41:58.220 --> 42:03.180]  Intro virus, D68 or flu, how do you know what your child has?
[42:03.180 --> 42:04.660]  Flu questions of the week.
[42:04.660 --> 42:08.140]  Well, when you go into most doctor's offices now.
[42:08.140 --> 42:14.060]  This has happened to me repeatedly with pediatricians, I've gone to different places, because the
[42:14.060 --> 42:21.940]  guy I had was really good, but he retired, and I'll say, yeah, my child has 101 fever
[42:21.940 --> 42:24.340]  and everything, let's kind of look down at their throat and everything, okay, here's
[42:24.340 --> 42:30.540]  some antibiotics, here's a prescription, and I go, wait a minute, when I go to the clinic
[42:30.540 --> 42:36.020]  that I go to, because the guy's friends with my dad, well, it's a big clinic, but the owners
[42:36.020 --> 42:39.900]  are friends with my dad, so I know it's a good place, and my dad said it was a great
[42:39.900 --> 42:42.940]  place and it has been, I've been going there for like 15 years.
[42:42.940 --> 42:48.460]  They don't give me antibiotics, they make me cough in a cup, or they swabbed my leg when
[42:48.460 --> 42:53.380]  I had an infection, and then I had to wait a day in excruciating pain, and they called
[42:53.380 --> 42:58.220]  back and said, this is what it is, you've got two drug resistant bacteria, one strep
[42:58.220 --> 43:03.380]  and one staff, and we're going to put you on two different hardcore antibiotics, don't
[43:03.380 --> 43:07.180]  drink when you're on these, these will hurt your liver, but this stuff's so hard to knock
[43:07.180 --> 43:10.780]  out, are you ready?
[43:10.780 --> 43:15.020]  You don't give people antibiotics, ladies and gentlemen, without testing and finding out,
[43:15.020 --> 43:19.660]  it's pointless when you've got a virus, and people said, oh, it's racism that the first
[43:19.660 --> 43:23.940]  Ebola patient who knew he had Ebola and ran over here and gave it to people in Dallas,
[43:23.940 --> 43:29.300]  remember Jesse Jackson, no responsibility, it's just racism.
[43:29.300 --> 43:33.340]  You rob a bank, it's racism, you mug somebody, it's racism, everything is somebody else's
[43:33.340 --> 43:34.340]  fault.
[43:34.340 --> 43:40.500]  Well, he went into the hospital and they didn't even test him, they just said, oh, here's
[43:40.500 --> 43:45.020]  some antibiotics, and he had Ebola, but that wasn't, like Jesse Jackson said, because they
[43:45.020 --> 43:50.700]  were racist, it's because they're inept and they don't care at most of these facilities,
[43:50.700 --> 43:57.860]  that's what's going on, and you know, Jesse Jackson's right in the way, this Ebola patient,
[43:57.860 --> 44:04.380]  zero, you notice he's the only one that's died, of all these white doctors they're bringing
[44:04.380 --> 44:15.540]  in here, Thomas Eric Duncan, that was his name, he's the only person that's died here
[44:15.540 --> 44:21.780]  of Ebola, 70% of people that get it died in Africa, sometimes 90%, but the only person
[44:21.780 --> 44:27.860]  that's died is a black guy, I was a black folks out there, I would be really concerned
[44:27.860 --> 44:32.980]  about this Ebola, there have been a lot of white folks die from it, but if you look at
[44:32.980 --> 44:40.900]  the numbers, maybe 20%, which is still an incredible kill rate, but if you're black,
[44:40.900 --> 44:43.740]  in fact, we have a lot of new listeners and people probably don't believe it, will you
[44:43.740 --> 44:48.700]  queue up that documentary and we'll show the article from the mid 90s when they declassified
[44:48.700 --> 44:53.540]  that they've developed airborne weaponized Ebola and other race specific bio weapons
[44:53.540 --> 44:57.900]  and they have the doctors that get it, the heads of Project Coast on there doing the
[44:57.900 --> 45:06.620]  interview, this is completely declassified, but I'm sick of hundreds of publications,
[45:06.620 --> 45:18.780]  CBS News, MSNBC, Salon, Raw Story, all of them, that's right, 60 minutes even did a
[45:18.780 --> 45:30.340]  piece on it, Dr. Death and his accomplice, but let's go ahead and play this clip dealing
[45:30.340 --> 45:35.540]  with weaponized viruses and bacteria for black people, so let's just get this out in the
[45:35.540 --> 45:59.900]  open, this is going on, here it is, Larry Ford had mutated cholera, typhoid, anthrax,
[45:59.900 --> 46:05.980]  botulism, bubonic plague, and it also came up with germs that he called kaffa killing
[46:05.980 --> 46:11.740]  germs, kaffa as you may know in Afrikaans is the equivalent of the N word, so these
[46:11.740 --> 46:17.020]  were germs that were specifically engineered to kill only black people.
[46:17.020 --> 46:24.260]  In other words, an ethnic biological weapon, have Project Coast really gone this far?
[46:24.260 --> 46:32.900]  From the beginning, this idea of can we find a way to control the size of the black population
[46:32.900 --> 46:37.780]  was considered one of the most important areas of research, it got even more important over
[46:37.780 --> 46:44.580]  time as the size of the black population and the seriousness of the uprising has increased,
[46:44.580 --> 46:54.220]  so that's one reason why they got into genetic modification, research into is there a way
[46:54.220 --> 47:02.260]  to have contraceptives, oh yeah let's play that part, somehow basically sterilized blacks
[47:02.260 --> 47:08.260]  without them knowing it and all kinds of what's at the time or in hindsight seem like pretty
[47:08.260 --> 47:17.060]  far out research, there was some talk about an ethnic weapon, Project Coast working one
[47:17.060 --> 47:27.900]  that was called black bomb, that was great, that was the most fun I've had in my life,
[47:27.900 --> 47:35.340]  that whole episode of the ethnic weapon was very well set out in court in the court papers,
[47:35.340 --> 47:51.300]  what happened is we had the objective to synthesize a certain protein that was in sperm for contraceptive
[47:51.300 --> 47:56.180]  purposes, the objective was that if you could immunize a woman against sperm then you would
[47:56.180 --> 48:04.140]  make her infertile, we were asked to do this by another country, we had a population explosion
[48:04.140 --> 48:10.780]  problem as part of the exchange of technology, they were giving us this stuff, that's right
[48:10.780 --> 48:16.780]  and you can go read those court documents, it's been in BBC, it's been in Derspiegel,
[48:16.780 --> 48:20.220]  it's mainly been in European papers in South African, but I remember watching hearings
[48:20.220 --> 48:26.380]  on it in Congress back in the mid 90s on C-SPAN, but it was Israel, the US, China was looking
[48:26.380 --> 48:34.300]  at it, Israel wanted to use it on the Arabs, the problem was about a third of the folks
[48:34.300 --> 48:43.820]  living in Israel are Arab Jews, or what you'd call actual precursor, original Jews, you
[48:43.820 --> 48:49.740]  know from Abraham, Abraham and Isaac and all the rest of it that goes back to the same
[48:49.740 --> 48:54.260]  people and so they had to back off of that because they killed a third of the Jews in
[48:54.260 --> 49:01.260]  Israel, but this is all the type of stuff that's going on, wouldn't kill Ashkenazi Jews
[49:01.260 --> 49:07.740]  but it would have killed the Sephardic Jews, people like my late friend Aaron Russo had
[49:07.740 --> 49:12.420]  killed him dead in a hammer, so when you say anti-Semitic you can actually say it means
[49:12.420 --> 49:18.300]  being anti-Arab or anti-Jew because that's where those folks come from, now the European
[49:18.300 --> 49:23.380]  derivation and if you get into all that research they'd have been just fine, the problem is
[49:23.380 --> 49:30.900]  so many of them have been married with Sephardic Jews or what you'd call the original 12 tribes
[49:30.900 --> 49:35.420]  I guess that it would wipe those folks out, see that's the problem with the race specific
[49:35.420 --> 49:40.140]  bio-weapon because yeah you can create a bowl that will kill 70-90% of the black people
[49:40.140 --> 49:48.260]  but it will kill 23% of the white people, see we're too similar, but don't worry they've
[49:48.260 --> 49:56.460]  gotten so much more high tech now that they're working on that problem, they're working on
[49:56.460 --> 50:00.820]  that problem and they put fluoride in everybody's water, they feed GMO to the white kids as
[50:00.820 --> 50:06.540]  well, the globalists can just get away with wiping on Africa because the governments are
[50:06.540 --> 50:10.460]  so corrupt, it's been colonial forever, it never got its freedom and they've already
[50:10.460 --> 50:14.620]  gotten away with so much that that's where they're testing everything, but I will assure
[50:14.620 --> 50:18.100]  all the liberal white yuppies that'll grab your shirt and say you know what there are
[50:18.100 --> 50:24.740]  too many black people, we need these abortuaries, I've had black and white liberals tell me
[50:24.740 --> 50:28.100]  that black people are bad, need to be gotten rid of, I've had black leaders on and said
[50:28.100 --> 50:32.140]  yeah of course we've all heard that, that's the big dirty weird secret of the Democratic
[50:32.140 --> 50:37.900]  Party, going back to Margaret Singer recruiting blacks who would hate other blacks and help
[50:37.900 --> 50:43.500]  keep them down, dumb them down, steal their money, not get them funding, I mean Al Sharpton's
[50:43.500 --> 50:49.940]  in the news, the FBI informer today and Rangel and others saying it's slavery that blacks
[50:49.940 --> 50:55.980]  vote Republican, no the real slavery is that you think you own all the black people and
[50:55.980 --> 51:15.660]  you won't tell them about race specific bio weapons, Sharpton.

[52:00.260 --> 52:03.020]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[52:03.020 --> 52:08.300]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriot Supply.
[52:08.300 --> 52:11.820]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment, frustrated with the
[52:11.820 --> 52:15.740]  direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick
[52:15.740 --> 52:16.740]  buck.
[52:16.740 --> 52:20.860]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[52:20.860 --> 52:24.860]  MyPatriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[52:24.860 --> 52:30.140]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hardworking American men
[52:30.140 --> 52:31.140]  and women.
[52:31.140 --> 52:34.020]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[52:34.020 --> 52:39.380]  And that's why I stock MyPatriot with high quality storeable foods for MyPatriot Supply.
[52:39.380 --> 52:44.540]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food

[52:56.660 --> 52:59.780]  MyPatriotSupply.com slash Alex.
[52:59.780 --> 53:03.740]  Do you lay awake at night and worry about the health and safety of you and your loved
[53:03.740 --> 53:04.740]  ones?
[53:04.740 --> 53:08.260]  Do you wonder what would happen if you weren't able to get to a hospital or doctor?
[53:08.260 --> 53:11.860]  How can you keep your family safe against the deadly pathogens that are beginning to
[53:11.860 --> 53:13.740]  emerge in the world today?
[53:13.740 --> 53:17.900]  Give yourself peace of mind with supernatural silver.
[53:17.900 --> 53:21.900]  Supernatural silver is turning heads around the world as a new weapon in the fight against
[53:21.900 --> 53:25.380]  bacteria, viruses and fungus.
[53:25.380 --> 53:29.540]  Supernatural silver can be taken internally or used topically to help the body's own
[53:29.540 --> 53:33.540]  immune system fight off disease much more effectively.
[53:33.540 --> 53:37.900]  Supernatural silver has been tested at independent universities and laboratories around the world
[53:37.900 --> 53:43.700]  and has been proven to be safe and highly effective against some of the planet's deadliest pathogens.
[53:43.700 --> 53:48.700]  There is no better product to have in your home for daily use or emergency preparedness.

[53:55.180 --> 54:16.140]  and your loved ones a fighting chance with supernatural silver.
[54:16.140 --> 54:25.020]  Speaking of protest music, he's got some new heavy songs coming out and he's going to send
[54:25.020 --> 54:29.580]  them to us right before his album comes out where he gets to premiere some of them here
[54:29.580 --> 54:32.680]  and on drums is Tommy Lee so you know it's going to be good.
[54:32.680 --> 54:36.700]  Look for that coming up next week and the reason that's important is there are so many
[54:36.700 --> 54:44.540]  people out there in Hollywood, rock stars, hip hop, you name it, that are awake to what's
[54:44.540 --> 54:50.460]  going on but so few like Dave Mustaine or Billy Corrigan have the courage to come out
[54:50.460 --> 54:53.500]  and speak out about it.
[54:53.500 --> 54:56.100]  Reason I mentioned that is I was just texting him during the break.
[54:56.100 --> 55:00.260]  There is so much election news to get to, I'll open the phones up, I promise I want to take
[55:00.260 --> 55:06.260]  your calls ahead of Dr. Joseph Mercola joining us but when you heard me playing one of the
[55:06.260 --> 55:12.140]  top medical doctors in the government of South Africa working with the US, China, Israel
[55:12.140 --> 55:19.700]  and others to create race specific bio weapons, you need to understand that this is very serious
[55:19.700 --> 55:24.380]  and PNAC back in 2000 the Projects for American Century chaired by Dick Cheney put out a paper
[55:24.380 --> 55:28.380]  saying we should look at the development and use of these.
[55:28.380 --> 55:32.500]  That's all I'm trying to say is you can't trust the people on top of this medical system
[55:32.500 --> 55:36.660]  not the average doctors or nurses and the way to stop this type of tyranny is to not
[55:36.660 --> 55:42.500]  just shut up when they say shut up, is to not just be a coward when they're disappearing
[55:42.500 --> 55:46.420]  people out of the hospital, no talk about it like the border patrol is done, reaching
[55:46.420 --> 55:51.300]  out to us and doctors have reached out to us and then we report it and millions find
[55:51.300 --> 55:55.740]  out about it but everybody else doesn't because no one else will cover it.
[55:55.740 --> 56:04.900]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, DrudgeReport.com carried our story and they had Democratic
[56:04.900 --> 56:15.100]  Party run websites attack us and say the whack job Alex Jones and in terms like that with
[56:15.100 --> 56:20.140]  thinly sourced articles claims people are disappearing really thinly sourced the head
[56:20.140 --> 56:26.300]  of a hospital by name naming the hospital where it happened and then we're saying we
[56:26.300 --> 56:29.540]  have another medical doctor on record and a whole bunch more that don't want to be on
[56:29.540 --> 56:33.580]  air and then the government tell everybody shut up and don't talk about Ebola and they're
[56:33.580 --> 56:37.500]  ordering millions of hazmat suits and they're letting people with it travel around and the
[56:37.500 --> 56:41.540]  borders open and they're letting people fly in with it, I mean something's obviously going
[56:41.540 --> 56:42.540]  on here.
[56:42.540 --> 56:50.540]  Let me tell you something, you're black and you get this, you got a 70% chance of coming
[56:50.540 --> 56:56.500]  up with X's in your eyes and I'm sorry that your leadership is run by the eugenics operation
[56:56.500 --> 57:00.860]  but so is all the quote leadership, I'm just so sick of being called racist because I don't
[57:00.860 --> 57:07.380]  want to kill all the black people or I don't want to forcibly inject all the girls in Guatemala
[57:07.380 --> 57:13.500]  and Mexico and Nicaragua and El Salvador with HPV that's known to reduce fertility and attack
[57:13.500 --> 57:18.100]  the ovaries on record, you're not going to hear Metsha and La Raza because they're all
[57:18.100 --> 57:22.220]  on the globalist payroll, look at their corporate funding, we don't have any of that corporate
[57:22.220 --> 57:28.020]  funding, they got 300, 400 corporate funders for groups that are like the Ku Klux Klan,
[57:28.020 --> 57:33.060]  genuinely say for our race everything, for your race nothing, we got the Democrats running
[57:33.060 --> 57:39.100]  around, the party of the Klan saying it's racist if you don't vote Democrat, I mean just what
[57:39.100 --> 57:44.020]  a joke, I'm going to cover that in the next hour ahead of your calls, briefly I'm taking
[57:44.020 --> 57:48.500]  my DNA force, my kids are taking their DNA force, this is what I believe is boosting
[57:48.500 --> 57:52.740]  my national defenses the most, go read the medical facts, the neutral medical facts in
[57:52.740 --> 57:59.060]  InfoWarsLife.com, the actual patented facts on this, on a product where we can actually
[57:59.060 --> 58:03.100]  make claims but I'm not going to make them on air, you go read what is on record, what
[58:03.100 --> 58:09.700]  they're patented, what they're proven to do, InfoWarsLife.com, the CoQ10, the BioPQQ
[58:09.700 --> 58:16.540]  of the organic super concentrated, neutral medical level, grade of that and the secret
[58:16.540 --> 58:21.380]  sauce that comes in in a week or two, I can't tell you what it is yet but I'm taking it
[58:21.380 --> 58:28.420]  and then we've got the Silver Bullet InfoWarsLife.com colloidal silver and we've got the Nation
[58:28.420 --> 58:33.340]  iodine X2 that I believe from my research, it's just as important as colloidal silver
[58:33.340 --> 58:38.460]  and then we've got Super Mel Vitality and I mix this up and I drink it and it is absolutely
[58:38.460 --> 58:51.060]  amazing InfoWarsLife.com, thank you all for your support, we'll be back second hour.
[58:51.060 --> 58:55.500]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo, at the same time
[58:55.500 --> 58:59.860]  they're restricting civilians rights to own and purchase firearms, can you put two and
[58:59.860 --> 59:00.860]  two together?
[59:00.860 --> 59:06.660]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably
[59:06.660 --> 59:09.780]  priced and fully legal but for how long?
[59:09.780 --> 59:22.580]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L Body Armor.com, Infidel Body Armor just
[59:22.580 --> 59:24.060]  won't quit.
[59:24.060 --> 59:31.460]  We have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[59:31.460 --> 59:36.980]  Super male vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended
[59:36.980 --> 59:37.980]  dose.
[59:37.980 --> 59:41.500]  I'm not as bad ready to fight these criminals every day, I look forward to waking up and
[59:41.500 --> 59:42.980]  taking my Super Male Vitality.
[59:42.980 --> 59:49.060]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Male Vitality and other powerful products
[59:49.060 --> 59:52.980]  from InfoWarsLife.
[59:52.980 --> 01:00:06.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:11.700]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:12.700]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:14.860]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:23.260]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:31.300]  Well, we got a race specific bio up in all the pantheon of experts we've had on, agreed.
[01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:34.460]  Rapidly spreading across Africa can infect millions, good kill millions.
[01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:38.140]  They're clearly, even mainstream news admits they're lying about the numbers that are dying
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:39.140]  over there.
[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:43.900]  They say it's 5,000 computer models, or by the end of the year, 1.4 million New York
[01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:47.020]  Times reports that could have it.
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:51.860]  And they're going to let as that exponential spread happens, people get visas and fly over
[01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:52.860]  here.
[01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:57.980]  And then if nurses treat them and even get favors, the CDC's going to tell them to fly.
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:00:59.700]  What do you think about that?
[01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:04.540]  And what do you think about Reed now tries begging the public to vote for him?
[01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:07.660]  Oh, you're going to call us terrorists if we don't vote for you?
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:09.260]  And 1 million Senate ads.
[01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:12.460]  They're buying 1 million ads, the Democrats are.
[01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:19.620]  A New York Times, 70% of Republicans, or the New York Times reports is a 70% chance Republicans
[01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:24.220]  will take the Senate Washington Post as 90% chance.
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:26.180]  But here's the issue.
[01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:30.020]  They have branded with the illegals who they pay for everything, give them free guitar
[01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:33.780]  lessons in state tuition, free health care.
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:38.820]  The red carpet with the banks, the corporations, Silicon Valley, I'm going to go over these
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:48.420]  articles in the next segment, rolls out the red carpet in every way to incentivize coming
[01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:49.420]  here.
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:53.860]  Now, once you're here, you're Hispanic citizen or black citizen or white citizen, you're
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:57.220]  not getting squad, you're going to get the book thrown at you.
[01:01:57.220 --> 01:02:01.540]  But the courts just will not prosecute illegals for crimes, felonies, drunk driving.
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:06.660]  They are GODs in the state's eyes, but only to incentivize.
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:15.140]  I mean, I drove by Home Depot, the corner of 35 and 290 today, I was late getting into
[01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:16.140]  the office.
[01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:17.140]  It was like 1050.
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:22.420]  That's why I wasn't on the first 30 minutes or first 20 minutes.
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:24.140]  And there had to be a hundred illegals.
[01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:30.060]  I mean, I want to send out there in the morning, I guess do it at like 10 o'clock and just
[01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:34.260]  walk up with folks that can speak Spanish, similar to our reporters that speaks good
[01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:36.700]  Spanish out there and just talk about where are you from?
[01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:37.700]  They'll say I'm from Guatemala.
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:38.700]  I'm from Nicaragua.
[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:39.700]  I'm from El Salvador.
[01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:42.540]  It's not even so much Mexico.
[01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:48.540]  And they just come and then they go work and then their wife goes and gets on welfare
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:56.020]  and then that's how they then become financially viable, which is fine and nandy, except they're
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:59.620]  above the law.
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:09.460]  And then they, I mean, you talk to them like the director of Utopia, the film where the
[01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:15.420]  exclusive distributor until December, Joel Gilbert, and they go, yeah, no, I'm here to
[01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:19.620]  escape socialism, but I like Obama because he gives me stuff.
[01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:22.700]  So you, you left socialism, but you like to come here and get it.
[01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:26.020]  And they're like, yeah, until it collapses.
[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:28.260]  So I got to hand it to the illegals.
[01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:29.540]  They at least know what's going on.
[01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:31.140]  I mean, they're not stupid.
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:34.380]  I come up here and I get free stuff.
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:37.380]  If I vote for you, okay.
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:40.460]  It's all about a takedown.
[01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:45.780]  And the funny thing is the illegals will then go out and just own guns illegally.
[01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:48.940]  So I don't know where all this is going, but it's a mess.
[01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:53.580]  And the Democrats to have power and controller doing this and the Republican leadership wants
[01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:57.540]  to do it with them because they're bought and paid for by the same interest.
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:03.940]  And once they have 51%, which they've almost got, this is a last gasp.
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.900]  As Met General Raza have said of white America, no, it's not.
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:09.340]  It's way past that.
[01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:16.060]  Identify with ideas and with, and with, and with morals and with what people stand for.
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:21.060]  Not with what color they are, but the globalist can get people to identify racially and then
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:30.260]  attach it to the immoral policies of anti-family, anti-gun socialism.
[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:34.380]  And so I take the high road and try to say, Hey, don't sterilize your kids.
[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:35.540]  Hey, let's promote free market.
[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:37.940]  Hey, let's try to fix your countries.
[01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:43.980]  It's like, no, because it's all about winning, even if it wrecks everything.
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:47.940]  It's all about, it doesn't matter if it wrecks everything and it's a giant slum.
[01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:53.100]  America becomes a giant ghetto slum third world.
[01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:58.340]  It doesn't matter because at least the TV will say the Raza one.
[01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:03.140]  It's just, it's a disaster when you're out on the road.
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:08.060]  The last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:13.140]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:21.820]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:28.420]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:34.980]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:39.980]  Blue diamond gussets got it, other stone.
[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:46.780]  We turn jeans inside out diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[01:05:56.420 --> 01:06:00.540]  When gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:06.700]  The experts are clear, sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude
[01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:08.980]  is essential to a healthy immune system.
[01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:16.660]  But I go further with SuperNacinIodineX2 from InfowarsLine.com, 50% stronger than our original
[01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:21.940]  and revolutionary nasin iodine formula, coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:23.380]  supplier has.
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:28.620]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:34.100]  Not our iodine, it comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested
[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:35.820]  and proven to be completely pure.

[01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:32.060]  are that we have listed at InfowarsLife.com, whether it's survival shield nasin iodine
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:39.340]  or DNA force, super male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shield, oxy
[01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:45.300]  powder, I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:50.900]  of other customers that have visited InfowarsLife.com and believed in us and tried the products.
[01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:56.940]  Folks, check out InfowarsLife.com today and the entire line of groundbreaking, cutting-edge,
[01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:26.220]  hard-core products.
[01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:47.060]  Well, that's the
[01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:53.140]  treasure of the Sierra Madres, and I think we should merge with Mexico.
[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:59.900]  There's any country that we should merge with, it's not Switzerland, it's not Monte Carlo,
[01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:04.740]  it's not the Netherlands, beautiful, well-run, incredible countries.
[01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:11.780]  No, I think we should merge with Sierra Leone, total collapsed, bedlam, Ebola, death, rape,
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:17.420]  robbery, murder, and Mexico, one of the highest crime rates, if not the highest in the world,
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:22.380]  90,000, it used to be 80, people killed the last six, seven years in the drug war, giant
[01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:29.500]  mass graves found everywhere, collapsing societies for a few resort towns like Cancun, and even
[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:32.780]  those are dangerous now.
[01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:38.220]  And but we're not allowed to judge and say that that is a dangerous place or that we
[01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:43.740]  shouldn't merge with that or advertise to all of collapsing Central and South America
[01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:52.900]  and Southern North America, come here, we'll give you free guitar lessons and you can have
[01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:54.220]  your baby for free.
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:59.900]  The Washington Times feds pay for illegal guitar lessons, illegal immigrants, youth
[01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:07.220]  cost 300 per child per day to shelter, but on top of that, one of the contractors housing
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:12.300]  some of the surge of illegal immigrant children from the summer offers them a petting zoo with
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:17.660]  miniature ponies and tilapia fish farm operation and guitar lessons, according to documents
[01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:23.060]  released Thursday by the senator who questioned whether the plush accommodations were a good
[01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:28.500]  use of tax for money will be loving.
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:33.860]  Be loving, ladies and gentlemen, I know that I can go to Mexico and just have a baby and
[01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:37.820]  go in and it's free or bring my kids there and just say, give me free stuff and they'll
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:38.820]  do it.
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:45.820]  No, they'd say you're here illegally and lock you up, but that's okay.
[01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:53.860]  Now the crime wave is exploding across the United States and so many police are being
[01:10:53.860 --> 01:11:00.740]  killed that it's now in the news today, though, that this might actually cause a backlash
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:03.980]  to this because it's so dangerous.
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:07.940]  When Ebola starts spreading, if it does, how is Obama and the globalists not going to
[01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:11.540]  get in trouble for leaving the flights open and bringing people in and letting the nurses
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:18.700]  and doctors run around on the planes and subways and everywhere else?
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:22.980]  Arizona already about a third of the state has signs up saying, don't go into this area,
[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:27.740]  it's controlled by drug cartels, the southern third of it.
[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:34.780]  They already have the kidnapping capital of the United States is now Phoenix, with thousands
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:38.500]  of kidnappings a year being taken to Mexico, just like in Mexico.
[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:42.460]  You know why I don't go to Nicaragua or El Salvador or Guatemala?
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:47.540]  I've been down there because you've got a very good chance that you're going to be
[01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:50.460]  kidnapped or your children will be.
[01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:55.900]  But see, we should just accept kidnapping as a cultural exchange and accept sewage running
[01:11:55.900 --> 01:12:01.300]  down the roads and accept this.
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:05.500]  Just like we should accept two plus two equals five and Obamacare has death panels and doubles
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:10.700]  prices on average and raises 20 plus taxes, seven of them on poor people.
[01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:16.780]  Even the state department's been forced to issue the last five years running a Mexico
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:21.380]  travel warning.
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:25.940]  Now even the resorts are dangerous down there.
[01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:30.660]  I won't even send reporters down there.
[01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:40.380]  Do you understand 90,000 dead, 58,000 died in 10 years of Vietnam, 90,000.
[01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:45.780]  By the way, there's over a million people missing in Mexico according to their own numbers.
[01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:50.500]  And when they go looking for one grave, they'll find graves every day in the news.
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:57.900]  Every day they find whole fields with 40 here, 20 there, a hundred there of dead men, women
[01:12:57.900 --> 01:12:58.900]  and children.
[01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:03.180]  By the way, you know what the code is to if they catch you coming across an area and you
[01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:07.620]  paid another gang and you didn't know from Nicaragua El Salvador, it doesn't matter.
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:09.340]  You're coming across Mexico.
[01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:11.300]  Do you know what they do with the men, women and children?
[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:15.900]  They take you and they shoot you and they put you in a shallow grave across from Texas,
[01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:21.500]  across from Arizona, across from California, across from New Mexico and it doesn't matter
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:27.380]  because Robert Rodriguez is down with the Raza, which is just a gang of rich, powerful
[01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:31.900]  Hispanics with the globalist mafia, just like the rich, powerful black mafia feeding on
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:32.900]  black people.
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:34.540]  They'll never tell you a word about that.
[01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:39.620]  He puts out a movie where Don Johnson talks like a Texas redneck and goes around shooting
[01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:41.660]  pregnant Hispanic women in the stomach.
[01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:45.620]  Let me tell you who shoots pregnant Hispanic women in the stomach.
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:50.100]  Mexican mafia does and they kill Nicaraguan and El Salvador women.
[01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:56.180]  About half the people they dig out of these graves, look it up, are women and children.
[01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:59.580]  It's not white people down there mowing down.
[01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:04.820]  They wish they could find a case of it, it'd be all that it is, mowing down Hispanics.
[01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:10.260]  It's Mexico baby.
[01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:12.900]  They take them and they shoot them and they throw them in ditches.
[01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:15.060]  That's why they're all over the border.
[01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:20.540]  You pretty much dig anywhere on those routes over the Texas border into Mexico or Arizona
[01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:26.140]  especially and you will find graves of the people with their little bags and their money
[01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:29.500]  and their little Mayan hats trying to come up here and get jobs.
[01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:30.500]  Poor people.
[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:31.500]  I feel sorry for them.
[01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:32.500]  But you know what?
[01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:34.420]  I didn't put them in the ditch and shoot them in the back of the head.
[01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:35.420]  You know what?
[01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:36.420]  It's my fault.
[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:37.420]  You're right.
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:38.420]  I'm the bad guy.
[01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:39.420]  I'm the white devil.
[01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:40.420]  I did it.
[01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:46.380]  So take your Gardasil shots, drink your fructose corn syrup and the man's going to saw your
[01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:48.420]  legs off when you get diabetes.
[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:49.940]  See the man's already killing you.
[01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:54.340]  They just want you here to vote long enough to get the guns then they're going to shut
[01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:59.100]  that border down real nice and you'll be drinking high fructose corn syrup and taking Gardasil
[01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:04.300]  shots that are race specific and they're going to kill you dead in a hammer.
[01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:09.780]  Take 10, 20 years but hey, it doesn't matter because you can go down to the La Raza race
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:15.700]  center and have some little mafia head sit up there and tell you how much they love you
[01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:17.540]  and want to take care of your culture.
[01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:25.940]  It's all a load of CIA written liberation theology, baloney, boulder dash, cockamamie
[01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:26.940]  fraud.
[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:32.500]  See I've read all the declassified CIA Carnegie Endowment Ford Foundation documents from the
[01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:36.300]  50s how they would create race war in America and divide everybody.
[01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:39.060]  See and that was a Democratic party again.
[01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:42.100]  The Republicans were the party that was against slavery not that they were perfect and they
[01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:45.740]  couldn't beat them so they teamed up with the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie
[01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:49.940]  Foundation, same folks that funded Adolf Hitler may have heard of him and they said you know
[01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:50.940]  what we're going to do?
[01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:54.420]  We're going to use our race politics we have with the Klan on the blacks and Hispanics and
[01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:57.980]  whites with the Republicans will buy into it because they're liberal and we'll take
[01:15:57.980 --> 01:16:02.220]  over and create a giant race division and then have the federal government ride herd
[01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:07.220]  all the racial groups like a big giant prison where you got the Mexican area and you got
[01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:11.900]  the El Salvadoran area and you got the Brazilian area and they're all killing each other and
[01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:16.740]  you got the black area and you got the Muslim area and you got the gay area and you got
[01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:21.900]  the liberal area and you got the redneck area and you got all the areas instead of having
[01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:28.580]  an area of free market prosperity, private property, free association, liberty, true
[01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:33.420]  freedom, renaissance, no it's a system where they claim they're fighting racism where all
[01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:37.940]  they teach kids is about race and about what somebody looks like the very opposite of what
[01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:42.140]  Martin Luther King said.
[01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:43.140]  How do you conquer the country?
[01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:45.100]  How do you take over?
[01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:53.420]  The demographics change the Republicans are sweeping taking over it's 1956, 1958, 1960
[01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:55.940]  what do you do?
[01:16:55.940 --> 01:17:01.180]  All these veterans came back even from Klan families and had seen racism and war and death
[01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:05.700]  and fought right beside people of other races and they didn't want to be racist anymore
[01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:08.060]  so the Klan was dying.
[01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:09.060]  What do you do?
[01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:12.180]  What do you do when it didn't work anymore?
[01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:19.100]  You just use race politics on the minorities and it's worked great, worked wonderful and
[01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:23.340]  that's why Miller Brewing and Anheuser-Busch and all the big universities and all the big
[01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:32.060]  TV networks, La Raza and Mecha get so much funding it'll make your head spin billions
[01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:41.260]  a year from globalist corporations to be racially based and to be racist.
[01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:45.460]  The good news is most Hispanics aren't buying into it and I don't just say that, you go
[01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:49.380]  out in public with me?
[01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:55.740]  Per capita black people and Hispanics love me more than white people do.
[01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:58.940]  It's amazing.
[01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:02.980]  We have an even bigger percentage of what you'd call, quote, minorities listen to the
[01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:08.940]  show and that's the type of hope we have is that this propaganda is so evil it cannot
[01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:13.660]  and should not work on people but they're force feeding it everywhere in the colleges
[01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:14.860]  and the public schools.
[01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:21.140]  When I went to Anderson High they force fed it in art class and US history and Texas history
[01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:26.780]  and they force fed it at UT when I was in high school they take us to UT field trips
[01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:35.220]  and I would sit there and hear this crap and I mean that is all they push ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:39.380]  And it's so sad because they don't want us to unify around ideas of freedom that will
[01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:45.140]  make us all incredibly successful and incredibly wealthy and incredibly free and independent
[01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:48.980]  if we take those opportunities instead we've been domesticated and I'm sorry I haven't
[01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:55.180]  even gotten into election news yet but so much of the election news is about the illegals.
[01:18:55.180 --> 01:19:00.660]  As Lorazza and Mecha and others publish voter guides on where to vote illegally, where you
[01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:02.540]  can vote without an ID.
[01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:11.060]  Look at these headlines, Obama's midterm loss record could make history, roll call, desperate
[01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:15.500]  Democrats resourced a race baiting to spur black vote, Washington Times, yeah here it
[01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:24.460]  is, Charles Rangel says some Republicans believe that slavery isn't over.
[01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:34.900]  I mean that is just so amazing that that that that that's what they resort to, Landry, Obama
[01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:41.580]  and I aren't Popper in the South because it's racist and sexist.
[01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:46.300]  Democrats vote or we'll kick your bleep.
[01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:49.300]  Facebook data mining for political views and what do they want?
[01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:50.300]  Open borders.
[01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:55.420]  Zuckerberg said is users are dumb efforts, we're going to come back with all this give
[01:19:55.420 --> 01:20:01.580]  out the number, take your phone calls ahead of Dr. Merkola joining us.
[01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:07.060]  My Magic Mud is a tooth whitening powder that removes plaque and detoxifies your mouth.
[01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:11.540]  It's safe for your enamel giving you a beautiful polish and a dentist's light clean after every

[01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:05.060]  This one in Toledo, Ohio where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink
[01:23:05.060 --> 01:23:06.060]  the water.
[01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:08.420]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:14.060]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every

[01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:12.060]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:15.380]  I want to get your take on election 2014.
[01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:17.940]  That's the big subject I want to hear from listeners on.
[01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:21.140]  I don't screen your calls but sometimes I throw out a topic.
[01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:22.540]  That's what I'd like to get your take on.
[01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:23.540]  Please give me a call.
[01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:35.660]  I'd love to hear from you on this Halloween Friday Worldwide Transmission 800-259-9231-825-99231.
[01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:42.420]  What you have is a pantheon of different political ideas out there and most of it is disinformation
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:47.420]  or a substratta of the system so it isn't complete.
[01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:52.820]  And I can tell you honestly from my deep research and interviewing top experts from
[01:24:52.820 --> 01:25:02.260]  around the world in social engineering, propaganda, bio weapons, intelligence operations, criminology,
[01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:10.300]  epidemiology, biology, social sciences, the top psychiatrists, the top psychologists,
[01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:13.700]  the top serial killer experts, I mean just think of the guests that have been on the
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:14.700]  show over the years.
[01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:18.100]  And I'm here listening to every show because I'm in the middle of it.
[01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:24.460]  I'm focused in a high adrenaline state to everything I'm covering.
[01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:26.460]  So I really know what I'm talking about.
[01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:28.300]  We really have their number.
[01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:31.180]  They really are trying to sterilize everybody in Latin America.
[01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:34.820]  They really are trying to kill the black people in Africa.
[01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:38.180]  And you don't hear a word out of that of any of the Latin American leaders or any of the
[01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:39.180]  black leaders here.
[01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:40.460]  You hear it out of the African leaders.
[01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:47.180]  You hear it from Nobel Prize winners in Africa.
[01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:51.740]  You understand, folks, the people running things and running all this race-pating want
[01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:56.180]  us all fighting with each other while they kill us and the group they're trying to keep
[01:25:56.180 --> 01:25:57.180]  so close.
[01:25:57.180 --> 01:26:01.980]  They act like they love so much, the minorities, that are really the majority worldwide.
[01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:05.780]  You are actually being wiped out by white racists.
[01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:08.260]  That's what's so incredible about it.
[01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:12.300]  It's like black leaders would go to the funeral of Robert Byrd, a grand dragon, who'd called
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:19.060]  for sterilizing all blacks in the 50s, and the ADL would give awards to Schwarzenegger,
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:24.740]  who said he loved Hitler, and give awards to George Soros, who worked for Hitler.
[01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:28.220]  And then the ADL would write articles about how I might be a racist.
[01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:33.740]  I mean, it's total 180 baloney.
[01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:36.180]  And we just got to have a break with these people.
[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:39.940]  I don't care what color you are or where you even came from.
[01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:45.500]  If you're for free market, second amendment, pro-life, you have arguments on both sides
[01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:46.500]  of that.
[01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:51.980]  But if you don't have human dignity, if you don't value life, if you don't care about
[01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:58.180]  children, if you're for death panels, if you want to euthanize people, so you'll, quote,
[01:26:58.180 --> 01:26:59.180]  get more.
[01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:00.700]  That's a lie to begin with.
[01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:02.740]  You won't get more in a system like that.
[01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:04.620]  No one's going to care about you.
[01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:06.220]  There's going to be no love.
[01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:09.220]  I hate these sociopathic robots you run into.
[01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:14.380]  I think they're smart because they're narcissistic, they're aggressive, they're con artists.
[01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:17.420]  They'd rather cheat you out of a dollar than make a million bucks with you.
[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:18.420]  They're failures.
[01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:21.180]  They came from bad families.
[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:24.700]  And you've got countries with a majority of people that just come from bad families,
[01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:31.140]  bad histories, and they don't have any hope.
[01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:32.460]  And I want a renaissance.
[01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:33.660]  I want free will.
[01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:35.060]  I want free association.
[01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:36.740]  I want you to win.
[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:38.740]  I don't care what color you are.
[01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:40.180]  I want you to have dignity.
[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:41.700]  I want you to have success.
[01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:43.020]  I want you to be wealthy.
[01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:44.500]  I want you to be strong.
[01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:52.180]  I want our progeny to explore the universe and the dimensions together.
[01:27:52.180 --> 01:27:57.860]  Not have it all robbed by the British royal family that's been funding the planetary system
[01:27:57.860 --> 01:28:00.540]  since the 1850s under eugenics.
[01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:03.540]  We live under a plan they launched.
[01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:06.380]  And just one spinoff was communism.
[01:28:06.380 --> 01:28:10.580]  Another spinoff was Nazism, transhumanism.
[01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:14.500]  It all goes directly back to them.
[01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:18.980]  And you don't, you're not part of their cult unless you've got an extremely high IQ and
[01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:21.260]  you're a psychopath or a sociopath.
[01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:27.980]  You got to have an IQ of 150 or higher and you've got to have a vicious hatred for humanity.
[01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:32.380]  And if you do, you know who Prince Charles hangs out with almost every day is psychopathic
[01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:38.980]  scientist with 170 IQs and he will just grovel to them in meetings and events they've written
[01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:39.980]  about it.
[01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:46.020]  And just, oh, sir, oh, I mean, I'll never forget Senator Rockefeller when John P. Holdren
[01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:52.160]  came in to give a testimony like five years ago, we played clips and he comes in and Jay
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:55.660]  Rockefeller, who I've seen many of his hearings, he was the chairman of the committee, he's
[01:28:55.660 --> 01:28:59.620]  now retiring, he spent 10 minutes just bowing his head.
[01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:04.860]  We ought to find that video going, sir, I, the owner is, there is no one better.
[01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:05.860]  Your plan is so incredible.
[01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:10.460]  What you're doing for us behind the scenes, you know, you don't like to brag, we just
[01:29:10.460 --> 01:29:11.580]  eco science, sir.
[01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:13.100]  And you know why?
[01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:23.020]  Because Hall Ehrlich, his wife, Annie Ehrlich and John P. Holdren's plan written in 1974
[01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:27.660]  is the declassified global plan for everything.
[01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:33.460]  John P. Holdren is essentially the pilot of Earth, you understand that?
[01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:38.660]  Understand the elite voted in their councils and basically elected him to run everything.
[01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:39.660]  And he does.
[01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:40.660]  He's at the White House right now.
[01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:41.660]  You understand?
[01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:49.900]  They are the forces of pure evil, they're coming for everybody, wake up or die.
[01:29:49.900 --> 01:30:01.100]  There on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:06.780]  Aging starts at the cellular level, when cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets
[01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:07.780]  in.
[01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:12.100]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:17.260]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve
[01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:23.020]  growth and rejuvenation, but no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on
[01:30:23.020 --> 01:30:28.540]  brain health, nerve growth factors and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:35.260]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA force, just one of the key compounds, BiOPQQ
[01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:41.700]  is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed listed published studies.

[01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:10.940]  the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:15.700]  Those key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxypowder, available through
[01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:20.940]  InfoWarsLife, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:26.060]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous
[01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:31.180]  ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[01:31:31.180 --> 01:31:35.900]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:40.820]  Oxypowder does not require time off work and there's no need for bad taste and concoctions.
[01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:47.100]  Instead, oxypowder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.

[01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:19.740]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:22.300]  Prime Directed discredit Alex Jones.
[01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:25.100]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:28.380]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:30.740]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:32:30.740 --> 01:32:32.300]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:35.020]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:41.020]  They are never going to stop. They are never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:44.620]  Block free iPhone app at InfoWars.com.
[01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:47.860]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:51.020]  Imperatives destroy real planet TV.
[01:32:51.020 --> 01:32:53.060]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy.
[01:32:53.060 --> 01:32:55.540]  Not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:32:55.540 --> 01:33:16.540]  Get electrically, it's begun, you can fail it.
[01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:18.540]  The Alex Jones show.
[01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:20.540]  Because there is a war on.
[01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:22.540]  Or your mind.
[01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:26.540]  By the way, if you just tuned in, you said, oh, this radio show is playing Halloween music.
[01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:28.540]  It's Halloween, not really.
[01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:32.540]  We play Halloween music here every day.
[01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:43.540]  Because reality is, the globalists are a lot scarier than any fantasy witches or goblins that might be sneaking around out there tonight.
[01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:48.540]  But it shows how they can take something and have kids scared of goblins.
[01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:57.540]  They're real live government and globalist creatures that are our fellow humans who would do things far worse than anything you can imagine in a movie.
[01:33:57.540 --> 01:33:59.540]  Alright, I want to go to your calls.
[01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:02.540]  The toll free number to join us is 800-25-99-231.
[01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:04.540]  Let me go through these headlines.
[01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:06.540]  Let me start back over.
[01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:09.540]  Obama's midterm loss record could make history.
[01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:17.540]  The big history is, though, can we scare the Republicans immediately to actually engage in reform?
[01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:21.540]  Repeal these unconstitutional executive orders shutting down our power plants.
[01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:24.540]  Hey, China put tariffs on us, put tariffs on them.
[01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:27.540]  Hey, repeal these gun laws.
[01:34:27.540 --> 01:34:29.540]  Hey, repeal Obamacare.
[01:34:29.540 --> 01:34:36.540]  See, if we don't instantly see a move by Boner, that's his real name, John Boehner, then we know the fix is in.
[01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:37.540]  Remove him.
[01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:39.540]  And this could happen.
[01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:42.540]  Look, this route isn't going to stop with the Democrats being thrown out.
[01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:43.540]  Here's another question.
[01:34:43.540 --> 01:34:45.540]  What's Obama going to do in the two years he's got left?
[01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:48.540]  Well, he said total amnesty into all deportations.
[01:34:48.540 --> 01:34:50.540]  It's already essentially happening.
[01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:52.540]  He's going to make the announcement.
[01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:55.540]  And just come after the guns.
[01:34:55.540 --> 01:34:58.540]  Launch all these new wars.
[01:34:58.540 --> 01:35:04.540]  Just you name it, get ready, because we're not going to be out of the woods if the Republicans take the Senate.
[01:35:04.540 --> 01:35:06.540]  Desperate Democrats.
[01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:08.540]  I just said Democrats.
[01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:11.540]  That was a Freudian slip.
[01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:17.540]  Desperate Democrats resort to race baiting to spur black vote.
[01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:18.540]  And I mentioned this.
[01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:23.540]  Charlie Rangel says some Republicans believe that slavery isn't over.
[01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:25.540]  Come on, Rangel.
[01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:28.540]  I mean, you make me want to throw up with all your race baiting.
[01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:29.540]  Does it ever end?
[01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:31.540]  It certainly works.
[01:35:31.540 --> 01:35:33.540]  90% of blacks end up voting for Democrats only.
[01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:35.540]  Pretty amazing.
[01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:41.540]  That's true. Obama and I aren't popular in the South because he's racist and sexist.
[01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:43.540]  Let me tell you what the South's doing.
[01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:55.540]  They're in trailers, whether they're black or white or Hispanic, watching NASCAR in football and wearing the exact same clothes, drinking the same beer, and getting the exact same diabetes and dying young.
[01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:57.540]  They watch satellite television.
[01:35:57.540 --> 01:35:59.540]  That's what they do in the South.
[01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:04.540]  And I'm sad for the South because just as I was a kid driving through, it looks like a bomb hit it.
[01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:05.540]  Beautiful.
[01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:07.540]  But again, everybody fighting with each other.
[01:36:07.540 --> 01:36:11.540]  Black people in the South wear the same overalls and talk the same.
[01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:12.540]  It's the same people.
[01:36:12.540 --> 01:36:14.540]  It just makes me want to throw up.
[01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:15.540]  Let me tell you this.
[01:36:15.540 --> 01:36:24.540]  Black people in the South have a lot more in common with white people in the South than they have with the New World Order globalists that might as well be Martians come here to kill us all.
[01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:28.540]  That's how separate these globalists are and that Queen of England over there.
[01:36:28.540 --> 01:36:30.540]  And they want them all dead anyway.
[01:36:30.540 --> 01:36:31.540]  Exactly.
[01:36:31.540 --> 01:36:32.540]  I'm just sick of it.
[01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:35.540]  Democrats vote or will kick your bleep.
[01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:36.540]  New York Post.
[01:36:36.540 --> 01:36:39.540]  Democrats are telling voters they had better go to the polls.
[01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:49.540]  The New York State Democratic Committee is bullying people and devoting next week with intimidating letters warning that it is easy to find out which slackers fail to cast a ballot next Tuesday.
[01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:50.540]  Yeah.
[01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:57.540]  That's like when Cuomo came out a few months ago or six months ago and said, you, if you're pro-gun or pro-life, get out of the state.
[01:36:57.540 --> 01:36:58.540]  And people said, are you serious?
[01:36:58.540 --> 01:37:00.540]  You said, I said, get out.
[01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:05.540]  What a delusional gangster.
[01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:10.540]  I mean, he really is going with the stereotype right there.
[01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:16.540]  And people are leaving New York in droves and all the sponges are moving there and it's not doing too good for the state, is it?
[01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:17.540]  He doesn't carry.
[01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:25.540]  That's one thing about these criminals is that it is the mid-level minions like the governors and people are just retail thugs.
[01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:27.540]  They have no idea what they're even part of.
[01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:30.540]  Facebook data mining for political views, Politico.
[01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:36.540]  And of course, it's basically a big whitewash, but what it does is they go on to admit is quote, promote the liberal agenda.
[01:37:36.540 --> 01:37:39.540]  Now, what it does is they use it as a weapon during election time.
[01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:47.540]  They won't let us share stuff on our Facebook that exposes Obama, but they'll let ISIS and white supremacists operate on it.
[01:37:47.540 --> 01:37:53.540]  I say let everybody operate as long as you're not calling for violence, which means ISIS shouldn't be on there.
[01:37:53.540 --> 01:38:02.540]  Fundraising emails try to shame last-minute donors and get their dollars.
[01:38:02.540 --> 01:38:04.540]  Non-citizens are voting.
[01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:09.540]  An article on the National Review documenting how massive the fraud is.
[01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:13.540]  Massive non-citizen voting uncovered in Maryland.
[01:38:13.540 --> 01:38:14.540]  Another report on that.
[01:38:14.540 --> 01:38:16.540]  This is out of Investors Business Daily.
[01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:20.540]  Well, Raza advocacy little more than a scheme to encourage illegals to vote.
[01:38:20.540 --> 01:38:23.540]  Really?
[01:38:23.540 --> 01:38:30.540]  Putting out advisories all over the country with voter guides on where you don't need IDs to vote, including what states.
[01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:34.540]  So it's like, you live in this state, but right next door, you don't have to have an ID, so get over there.
[01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:40.540]  What?
[01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:41.540]  Look at this headline.
[01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:46.540]  Pelosi, Gutierrez, Obama should give temporary amnesty to all illegals.
[01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:48.540]  Yeah, and then so anybody can get here.
[01:38:48.540 --> 01:38:54.540]  Imagine if Switzerland said, we're just going to let anybody that can get here get here.
[01:38:54.540 --> 01:38:57.540]  Actually, nobody would show up because they don't have much of a welfare state.
[01:38:57.540 --> 01:38:59.540]  And it's very expensive.
[01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:02.540]  And then he's like, oh, you got $20 million.
[01:39:02.540 --> 01:39:04.540]  Sorry, you can't come to Switzerland.
[01:39:04.540 --> 01:39:07.540]  We want to know what skill you're going to bring.
[01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:10.540]  Oh, you're a scientist that's invented a bunch of stuff.
[01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:11.540]  Oh, please come.
[01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:12.540]  You don't need any money.
[01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:13.540]  Just come here.
[01:39:13.540 --> 01:39:17.540]  We want your brain.
[01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:19.540]  Oh, boy.
[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:20.540]  And then everybody's got guns.
[01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:22.540]  They have the lowest crime rate in the world.
[01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:26.540]  Oh, it's so horrible.
[01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:28.540]  Maybe I should escape to Switzerland.
[01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:30.540]  I don't have enough money to.
[01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:34.540]  That's what I was thinking.
[01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:35.540]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:39:35.540 --> 01:39:45.540]  Switzerland, when we had Paul Watson and them over there about three, four years ago, by the end of it, they had members of their cantones marching into the hotel.
[01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:58.540]  And when the Bilderberg security roughed them up, the Swiss police showed up, federal and local and came in and said, yeah, we're going to go ahead and let a delegation come in and investigate you because you're part of the EU and want to take over Switzerland.
[01:39:58.540 --> 01:40:03.540]  And so all of a sudden in the middle of the night, helicopters start escaping and we bum rushed it.
[01:40:03.540 --> 01:40:08.540]  It shut down a day early and helicopters, dozens and dozens of helicopter flights.
[01:40:08.540 --> 01:40:13.540]  You understand that Switzerland, the cops went in there because they recognized an enemy to their country.
[01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:17.540]  You know, it goes back to William Tell and that's their, their art types there.
[01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:21.540]  William Tell, the whole Apple story, that's true.
[01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:27.540]  Shooting the apple off the sun's head with the crossbow, but that's not what he's famous for.
[01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:35.540]  He then went and killed a whole bunch of the, of the foreign usurper who'd come in from another country and was bringing foreigners in to dominate him.
[01:40:35.540 --> 01:40:36.540]  Oh, same thing.
[01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:38.540]  And he went and killed a whole bunch of them.
[01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:39.540]  That's the story of William Tell.
[01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:43.540]  So that's in the Swiss soul, they know that.
[01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:46.540]  That's why they love me in Switzerland, not because I'm anything special.
[01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:47.540]  They get it.
[01:40:47.540 --> 01:40:56.540]  Our founding fathers pointed to Switzerland as the model because in 1776, what the Swiss had done was only a hundred years old.
[01:40:56.540 --> 01:40:58.540]  The Dutch had done something similar.
[01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:00.540]  They had that later taken away from them.
[01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:02.540]  Only Switzerland is still somewhat free.
[01:41:02.540 --> 01:41:07.540]  And notice the globalists want to go live where they haven't spoiled everything.
[01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:15.540]  They've gone around and done, you know what, all over our houses, but they keep that little corner clean for them.
[01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:16.540]  Isn't that just cute?
[01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:19.540]  Isn't that just funny?
[01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:23.540]  Guns, low crime, freedom, but so many rich people move there.
[01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:26.540]  It's hard to live there because the cost of living.
[01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:28.540]  I said I'd go to your phone calls.
[01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:30.540]  Let's continue.
[01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:37.540]  Representative Smith of Texas slams use of Obamacare funds promote amnesty for illegals.
[01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:38.540]  Oh, yeah.
[01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:50.540]  By the way, $20 billion has disappeared in secret purchases in just the last two months.
[01:41:50.540 --> 01:41:54.540]  NBC News reports.
[01:41:54.540 --> 01:41:58.540]  And just $30,000 of it was Starbucks coffee.
[01:41:58.540 --> 01:42:03.540]  They've now reached collapse level where the feds are now God and the illegals are their demigod.
[01:42:03.540 --> 01:42:07.540]  And they're all above the law, just wallowing in theft.
[01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:13.540]  But if you're a good person in the federal government and don't play ball with the little crews of black cats, as I call them,
[01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:17.540]  the bad guys that have taken over, they run you out.
[01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:24.540]  Oh, Colonel Schaefer, you use your cell phone to call your wife on 20-something occasions.
[01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:29.540]  We're going to try to indict you because you expose that we're working with Bin Laden.
[01:42:29.540 --> 01:42:30.540]  That failed.
[01:42:30.540 --> 01:42:36.540]  But imagine you called your wife 20-something times on your government cell phone that's for government business.
[01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:40.540]  And then they went and said, look, it says you're allowed to call your wife.
[01:42:40.540 --> 01:42:41.540]  But it didn't matter.
[01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:51.540]  They could just say he's being looked at for using his phone improperly, his phone improperly to call his wife.
[01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:55.540]  See, calling your wife on your government phone, that's bad.
[01:42:55.540 --> 01:42:56.540]  But you know what?
[01:42:56.540 --> 01:42:59.540]  You want to fund South Africa to create weaponized Ebola to kill black people?
[01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:07.540]  Hey, baby, we got your back.
[01:43:07.540 --> 01:43:09.540]  Obama may cut deportations.
[01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:11.540]  Here it is on the Wall Street Journal.
[01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:13.540]  They've already cut him down to nothing.
[01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:15.540]  Mother of man killed by illegals.
[01:43:15.540 --> 01:43:17.540]  President ignoring us completely.
[01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:18.540]  Of course he is.
[01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:24.540]  The bodyguards.
[01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:28.540]  I'm going to stop right there and go to some of your phone calls.
[01:43:28.540 --> 01:43:31.540]  But Senator Sessions says the world has been turned upside down.
[01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:36.540]  It's total insanity that the country is being imploded and turned into a bankrupt society and that we're in a total crisis.
[01:43:36.540 --> 01:43:39.540]  It's a hysterical article, he wrote.
[01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:44.540]  And Senator Sessions is absolutely right.
[01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:49.540]  President, Democrat, super lawyers prepped for overtime trying to take over the election.
[01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:54.540]  Facebook, Mother Jones pushes for Democrats to vote, data mines.
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:43:56.540]  That's just some of the news that we've got here.
[01:43:56.540 --> 01:43:57.540]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:43:57.540 --> 01:43:58.540]  We'll go to your calls.
[01:43:58.540 --> 01:44:09.540]  Then I've got Joe Biggs report where he went out to UT and 13 of 20 people signed a petition to let women kill their children up to age five.
[01:44:09.540 --> 01:44:13.540]  And Joe did a great job, but he basically says in the report these are basically evil people.
[01:44:13.540 --> 01:44:20.540]  I think a lot of them are just so compliant that they'll just sign whatever they're told if they're told it's for a woman or it's for Obama.
[01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:22.540]  Like stick your hand in light socket for women.
[01:44:22.540 --> 01:44:24.540]  Absolutely.
[01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:26.540]  Turn your guns in or you're racist.
[01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:29.540]  Say you're for Obama, carry your racist.
[01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:32.540]  Well, there's death panels and it doubles my prices, but you know what, I'm for it.
[01:44:32.540 --> 01:44:35.540]  I don't think they're even evil.
[01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:38.540]  They just are jellyfish.
[01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:40.540]  Planet jellyfish.
[01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:41.540]  We're going to go to your calls.
[01:44:41.540 --> 01:44:45.540]  I just want to remind listeners.
[01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:48.540]  That we have produced DNA force.
[01:44:48.540 --> 01:44:59.540]  The most hardcore concentrated organic, nutraceutical, turbo charging, bio PQQ CoQ 10 and all the other.
[01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:05.540]  Key ingredients at half the price of the leading competitor that isn't even as strong or pure.
[01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:10.540]  And some nutraceuticals of the similar type are four times more than this.
[01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:13.540]  It's available at infowarslife.com.
[01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:17.540]  And that's what I'm doing to bolster my defenses and get my immune system up.
[01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:21.540]  Also, survival shield X2 group was in here with like 14 different studies.
[01:45:21.540 --> 01:45:27.540]  I'd let him get to it the other day about what iodine does to the immune system, what it does to viruses, what it did.
[01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:32.540]  When they tried to give rats the flu or mice killer flu and then they would give them iodine and what it would do.
[01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:35.540]  This is the best of the best, the iodine out there for my research.
[01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:42.540]  The creme d'ala creme, the Monte Carlo Luxembourg at a price lower than leading competitors.
[01:45:42.540 --> 01:45:45.540]  Survival shield X2 is shelling out.
[01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:50.540]  It will sell out unfortunately in the next week, week and a half at current sales rate.
[01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:53.540]  We underestimated how much people would want this.
[01:45:53.540 --> 01:45:55.540]  It may take two to three weeks to get it.
[01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:59.540]  So if you want it, we have it right now to ship it right out to you the day after you order it.
[01:45:59.540 --> 01:46:00.540]  Unless it's on the weekend.

[01:46:38.540 --> 01:46:39.540]  And most of them do.
[01:46:39.540 --> 01:46:44.540]  You get 5% off with NOW at checkout and your purchase supports this transmission.
[01:46:44.540 --> 01:46:46.540]  And people notice I have better skin.
[01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:47.540]  I've lost a ton of weight.
[01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:48.540]  I've got more energy.
[01:46:48.540 --> 01:46:49.540]  I'm nicer around the office.
[01:46:49.540 --> 01:46:51.540]  Everybody ask what is it?
[01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:56.540]  It is the group of products that we've developed with Dr. Group and my dad and others.
[01:46:56.540 --> 01:46:59.540]  Just off the cutting edge, literature and info.
[01:46:59.540 --> 01:47:02.540]  And the truth is the competition out there isn't competition.
[01:47:02.540 --> 01:47:08.540]  The wellness market, nutrient market just continues to explode as mainline healthcare gets worse and worse.
[01:47:08.540 --> 01:47:18.540]  People don't want, they want to put marketing out and promote something as wonderful but have what's in the bottle cost $2.
[01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:21.540]  You understand that?
[01:47:21.540 --> 01:47:25.540]  They want to sell it for $20 and have what's in the bottle cost $2.
[01:47:25.540 --> 01:47:31.540]  But we sell it for $25 and what's in the bottle cost $12 in one case.
[01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:36.540]  Or what's in our bottle cost $45 and we sell it for $100.
[01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:41.540]  Or what's in the bottle cost us $18 and we sell it for $54.
[01:47:41.540 --> 01:47:45.540]  Still a big markup but in most supplements there's a seven fold markup.
[01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:47.540]  We mark it up one time or a time and a half.
[01:47:47.540 --> 01:47:50.540]  Because with overhead, running the operation, that sounds like a lot.
[01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:51.540]  It's not.
[01:47:51.540 --> 01:47:55.540]  And the industry's turning heads at us because we want to put out knock your socks off.
[01:47:55.540 --> 01:48:01.540]  Super strong, hardcore stuff that the globalist have been targeting and don't want people to know about.
[01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:07.540]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:48:07.540 --> 01:48:10.540]  And your purchase of all these fine products also supports the transmission.
[01:48:10.540 --> 01:48:12.540]  So it's a win-win-win-win-win.
[01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:13.540]  Okay, let's go to calls.
[01:48:13.540 --> 01:48:15.540]  James in California, thanks for calling.
[01:48:15.540 --> 01:48:16.540]  You're on the air.
[01:48:16.540 --> 01:48:21.540]  Hi, Alex, I just want to say great work all these years and I'll try and keep it short.
[01:48:21.540 --> 01:48:26.540]  I kind of got a three-step plan to solve the issue.
[01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:28.540]  Number one, go on a vote strike.
[01:48:28.540 --> 01:48:30.540]  No confidence vote, basically.
[01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:32.540]  Number two, tax strike.
[01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:33.540]  Shut them all down.
[01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:35.540]  They can't do anything without the money.
[01:48:35.540 --> 01:48:38.540]  And number three, repudiate all the debt.
[01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:41.540]  How much more complicated can it get?
[01:48:41.540 --> 01:48:53.540]  Well, the 600, 700 trillion that they say the US owes of the 2.0 or 2 quadrillions, it was 1.5 quadrillions.
[01:48:53.540 --> 01:48:59.540]  Now it's, according to even the Washington Post, over 2,000 trillion.
[01:48:59.540 --> 01:49:01.540]  That's hard to say, it's so big.
[01:49:01.540 --> 01:49:09.540]  They claim that over 800, 900, it varies, is owed by the US, but our national debt's 18 trillion.
[01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:12.540]  Well, we're capable of living within our own means.
[01:49:12.540 --> 01:49:16.540]  We can see ourselves, we can call ourselves, we have all the water we need.
[01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:24.540]  I agree with you, and they want us domesticated, and they're trying to build this Panopticon high-tech system where we can't live without them.
[01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:27.540]  God bless you, great points.
[01:49:27.540 --> 01:49:32.540]  As for a tax protest, this is a criminal government.
[01:49:32.540 --> 01:49:37.540]  The money's just used in slavice, especially to the private Federal Reserve, but this is a criminal group.
[01:49:37.540 --> 01:49:39.540]  So I don't advise folks to do it, that's your decision.
[01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:42.540]  If you make that decision, we're power to you.
[01:49:42.540 --> 01:49:44.540]  They say 60 million people don't file now.
[01:49:44.540 --> 01:49:45.540]  Folks are done.
[01:49:45.540 --> 01:49:48.540]  They see the illegals above the law, well, they're above the law too, I guess.
[01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:56.540]  The government's above the law, Google doesn't pay tax, General Electric doesn't pay tax, all these globalists don't pay tax, fine, whatever, do whatever you're going to do, that's your decision.
[01:49:56.540 --> 01:50:03.540]  But as for what you raise about repudiating the debt, let's not miss the forest of the threes.
[01:50:03.540 --> 01:50:06.540]  Our national debt is approaching 19 trillion.
[01:50:06.540 --> 01:50:11.540]  It's untenable, it's insane, most of it's fraud, most of it's interest.
[01:50:11.540 --> 01:50:19.540]  Real what we owe long term with Social Security, all these other debts, 100 trillion?
[01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:22.540]  So let's say we really owe 100 trillion.
[01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:25.540]  Why are they saying it's 900 trillion?
[01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:28.540]  Because we were signed on to derivatives in 2008.
[01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:31.540]  It wasn't about the quote bailout of 867 billion.
[01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:33.540]  That was an open window.
[01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:37.540]  They got 50 something trillion last time I checked out of that.
[01:50:37.540 --> 01:50:44.540]  What we're talking about here is that they've signed us on to 800 trillion that is indisputably not our debt.
[01:50:44.540 --> 01:50:46.540]  No, no, no, it's not ours.
[01:50:46.540 --> 01:50:47.540]  You're absolutely right.
[01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:52.540]  All right, we're going to come back and go to Jack in Florida, Ron in Canada.
[01:50:52.540 --> 01:50:56.540]  We're going to go to Jersey and others.
[01:50:56.540 --> 01:51:15.540]  Jennifer, stay with us.
[01:51:26.540 --> 01:51:30.540]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:51:56.540 --> 01:52:02.540]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:52:02.540 --> 01:52:07.540]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriots supply.
[01:52:07.540 --> 01:52:10.540]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment,
[01:52:10.540 --> 01:52:12.540]  frustrated with the direction this country was headed,
[01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:15.540]  and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:20.540]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:24.540]  MyPatriots supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:52:24.540 --> 01:52:30.540]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:52:30.540 --> 01:52:33.540]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach,
[01:52:33.540 --> 01:52:38.540]  and that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from MyPatriots supply.

[01:53:55.540 --> 01:53:58.540]  800-325-6384.
[01:53:58.540 --> 01:54:05.540]  Well, the feds have stolen $20 million the last two months. Won't say where the money went.
[01:54:05.540 --> 01:54:11.540]  NBC says it was for like clothing and watches and Starbucks coffee.
[01:54:11.540 --> 01:54:13.540]  No one will get in trouble.
[01:54:13.540 --> 01:54:17.540]  Huge fire at French public radio building in Paris. They say it could be terrorism.
[01:54:17.540 --> 01:54:24.540]  Folks were asking what I thought of that. We don't know yet. It might just be a...
[01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:30.540]  loving al-Qaeda operative or something. I mean, our government and the French help fund them, so what do they expect?
[01:54:30.540 --> 01:54:33.540]  Let's go to Jack in Florida.
[01:54:33.540 --> 01:54:37.540]  Jack, you're on the air talking about election 2014. Thanks for calling.
[01:54:37.540 --> 01:54:44.540]  Yeah, Alex. Start with, thanks for the X2. I've been taking it, and it seems like it has been working.
[01:54:44.540 --> 01:54:46.540]  Anyway, what I'm calling about.
[01:54:46.540 --> 01:54:56.540]  I live here in Florida. Everybody in Florida here has been shafted here on this governor's race.
[01:54:56.540 --> 01:55:01.540]  We've had two or three debates here on the governor's race in Florida.
[01:55:01.540 --> 01:55:09.540]  If it'll let the libertarian... His name is Adrian Wiley. They wouldn't even let him in the debates.
[01:55:09.540 --> 01:55:12.540]  I mean, here in the state has been shortchanged.
[01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:20.540]  This fellow, we got four more days to the election. Everybody that hasn't voted anyway needs to get out and check this fellow out.
[01:55:20.540 --> 01:55:28.540]  Here, he's going to be able... Everybody on here knows what the cat for it is. He does also check all these departments in his state out.
[01:55:28.540 --> 01:55:37.540]  On top of that, he's going to be able to give a 100% homestead exemption on the house that you were in.
[01:55:37.540 --> 01:55:42.540]  That's right, and not only have they exempted him, because David Knight interviewed him on the nightly news last week.
[01:55:42.540 --> 01:55:48.540]  He is polling 10% or 12%, and they still kept him out of the debates.
[01:55:48.540 --> 01:55:55.540]  Because if he got up on a debate and said, we'll give you a 100% homestead exemption, he would actually own your house.
[01:55:55.540 --> 01:56:01.540]  Until 100 years ago, folks, you actually owned your house. Not even the king of anyone could come in it.
[01:56:01.540 --> 01:56:10.540]  Now... Sir, he's going to start with these against these private prisons we got going on all over the country.
[01:56:10.540 --> 01:56:14.540]  No, I know, sir, what I'm saying is, what I'm saying is, we've had him on. We think he's great.
[01:56:14.540 --> 01:56:22.540]  And what I'm saying is, that's why they won't let him in the debate, because those ideas are so popular, and it shows how the system's rigged.
[01:56:22.540 --> 01:56:26.540]  I'm just glad to get on here to get the word out. Everybody needs to check us and do it out.
[01:56:26.540 --> 01:56:33.540]  His name's Adrian Wiley. Go up on your Google or start page or whatever you use. Check him out.
[01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:41.540]  Go vote for him. Anyway, it's a chance we got here in Florida if people could actually know he's running and what he's saying for.
[01:56:41.540 --> 01:56:43.540]  Anyway, thanks, Alex.
[01:56:43.540 --> 01:56:49.540]  Thank you, sir. Great point. You just got me excited when you brought that up, because here he is getting 10 to 12 points in the polls.
[01:56:49.540 --> 01:56:55.540]  Massive for a libertarian. They know he could end up winning, so they just don't tell you about him.
[01:56:55.540 --> 01:57:02.540]  That's an example of how sick this is. Ron in Canada, you're on the year. Go ahead.
[01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:07.540]  How are you doing? Good, brother. Go ahead.
[01:57:07.540 --> 01:57:11.540]  Good. I'm glad I got a hold of you today. Alex, I want to say something about the election.
[01:57:11.540 --> 01:57:17.540]  Okay, I live in Canada, so I know some people think it's no big deal for me, but it is.
[01:57:17.540 --> 01:57:20.540]  I follow it just as closely as I would my own Canadian parliament.
[01:57:20.540 --> 01:57:26.540]  I think the elections are going to be rigged. There's no question in my mind, especially with the new computer systems they got in place.
[01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:32.540]  I've seen some of the trials with the software developers. I know that these guys have put so many backdoors in these programs.
[01:57:32.540 --> 01:57:36.540]  There's room for rigging elections and all kinds of stuff.
[01:57:36.540 --> 01:57:43.540]  Obama is getting away with, or sorry, Obolo is getting away with way too much.
[01:57:43.540 --> 01:57:53.540]  Well, we know they're legalizing illegals outside of law by executive fiat. If that isn't impeachable, if that isn't illegal, I don't know what is.
[01:57:53.540 --> 01:58:00.540]  And so we know there's massive fraud going on right there, so I agree with you that we're going to see massive manipulation,
[01:58:00.540 --> 01:58:10.540]  but as Bev Harris and other experts on electronic voting have said, it's hard for electronic voting to beat landslides
[01:58:10.540 --> 01:58:15.540]  because the exit polls and things don't match and the establishment's a little skiddy of that.
[01:58:15.540 --> 01:58:23.540]  They steal close elections. They steal a lot of local prop issues, too.
[01:58:23.540 --> 01:58:29.540]  But I hear you, we'll be watching that this Sunday with live coverage and next Monday and Tuesday.
[01:58:29.540 --> 01:58:37.540]  We're going to be broadcasting for at least 10 hours extra coming up on Tuesday in the lead-up on M4 Wars Nightly News.
[01:58:37.540 --> 01:58:43.540]  Stay with us next hour coming up.
[01:58:43.540 --> 01:59:08.540]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:59:13.540 --> 01:59:19.540]  Or because they don't ask all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at infowarslife.com.
[01:59:19.540 --> 01:59:29.540]  Whether it's Survival Shield, nascent iodine, or DNA force, super male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shield, oxy powder.
[01:59:29.540 --> 01:59:40.540]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.
[01:59:40.540 --> 01:59:51.540]  Folks, check out infowarslife.com today and the entire line of groundbreaking, cutting-edge, hardcore products.
[02:00:11.540 --> 02:00:18.540]  You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.540 --> 02:00:26.540]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.540 --> 02:00:30.540]  Dr. Joseph Merkola's coming up. We'll also take some of your phone calls.
[02:00:30.540 --> 02:00:36.540]  Right now, we're talking election. Pete, New Jersey, thanks for calling. Thanks for holding. You're on the air, Pete.
[02:00:36.540 --> 02:00:46.540]  Thanks, Alex. Thank you so much, Alex. Hey, I'm a long-time listener. I've got two quick observations, a very quick action plan, and a quick historical quote that I'd like to upload today if I can.
[02:00:46.540 --> 02:00:54.540]  My observation number one, this election on Tuesday, in my view, is the most important election in the history of the United States of America.
[02:00:54.540 --> 02:01:02.540]  This, well, could very well be our last opportunity for a peaceful and political change in turning up the tide in this country.
[02:01:02.540 --> 02:01:12.540]  My observation number two, if this election goes the wrong way, in my view, the Bush Clinton crime family will be one step closer to reaching their objectives,
[02:01:12.540 --> 02:01:24.540]  namely the takedown and destruction of the republic on behalf of their globalist, elitist masters as their price for the promise of admittance into the next level of the globalist power structure.
[02:01:24.540 --> 02:01:34.540]  These individuals are not only traders, they are fools. Okay. Here's my action plan. This election, in my view, needs to be a national referendum on the following two questions.
[02:01:34.540 --> 02:01:46.540]  I'll get to that in a moment because before I talk about the questions, I'm issuing a clarion call to all info warriors and citizen journalists to get into the face of every politician running for election on Tuesday,
[02:01:46.540 --> 02:01:54.540]  especially those running for governor, senate, or the Congress, with these two very simple yes or no questions.
[02:01:54.540 --> 02:02:01.540]  Question number one, do you support the immediate ban on all commercial flights from a bull shriking West Coast African nations?
[02:02:01.540 --> 02:02:09.540]  Yes or no, it's a simple question. Question number two, if elected, and it's especially for those running for congress, House or senate,
[02:02:09.540 --> 02:02:28.540]  if elected, will you pursue all legal remedies to stop the implementation of the illegal, unconstitutional, dictatorial, executive order that the president has clearly stated he will sign to grant blanket amnesty to illegal aliens in the United States?
[02:02:28.540 --> 02:02:41.540]  Yes or no, it's a simple question. Every politician running for office needs to be put on the public record. No one but info warriors and citizen journalists will be asking those types of questions.
[02:02:41.540 --> 02:02:51.540]  They need to be caught on camera and their positions need to be clearly known. Okay. Here's my historical quote. I'm going to catch my breath.
[02:02:51.540 --> 02:03:03.540]  Folks, as it's through the midst of time, well beyond the grave, echoes the last and final standing order from our country's first commander in chief.
[02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:12.540]  And I quote, there is but one straight court. And that is to seek truth and pursue it steadily. George Washington.
[02:03:12.540 --> 02:03:23.540]  Well, I love George Washington. Well, I tell you, brother, we in the future are going to have auxiliary reporters. We don't have the money to hire them full time part time. You're the type of guy that send us your resume, send us some info.
[02:03:23.540 --> 02:03:41.540]  Pete from New Jersey, you're a very super articulate guy. I wish I was like you. In fact, that's what we should thematically call our election coverage next Monday and Tuesday on the nightly news in here is referendum on Obama referendum on
[02:03:41.540 --> 02:03:53.540]  tyranny referendum. Will we totally reject they're saying this to be the biggest landslide in history in the US, the bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[02:03:53.540 --> 02:04:05.540]  And if you do see Democrats turn on Obama, because they understand he is absolutely destroying this country, then that is a referendum against globalism and the new world order.
[02:04:05.540 --> 02:04:17.540]  And we'll send shockwaves around the world. That's why the foreign banks that only come here for F one. A lot of them are in my city right now. These globalists, they only come here once or twice a year.
[02:04:17.540 --> 02:04:25.540]  They don't care. We're turned into a third world country. They want us bankrupted to politically control us. And so, Pete, real quick, tell us about yourself. What do you do?
[02:04:25.540 --> 02:04:36.540]  Well, Alex, I have one thing that I like to hear. I only got about 20 seconds. Okay, I got it. My father used to say one thing very important. There are three kinds of people in this world, workers, beggars and thieves.
[02:04:36.540 --> 02:04:48.540]  And right now the thieves are the beggars are working together to suck the lifeblood out of working America. That's it. And then they hit us on the head, the workers on the head, the beggars and the thieves, and we say, Hey, stop sucking my blood.
[02:04:48.540 --> 02:04:59.540]  They go, shut up, racist or shut up homophobe or you don't like women because you don't like Hillary Clinton. I don't like criminals and I don't like being a slave. I bless you, brother. Send us your info. You might be a good auxiliary reporter.
[02:05:19.540 --> 02:05:28.540]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has. Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:05:28.540 --> 02:05:35.540]  Not our iodine. It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:07:10.540 --> 02:07:30.540]  The new ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder, available through infowarslife, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies. Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[02:07:30.540 --> 02:07:45.540]  You can gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep. Oxy powder does not require time off work and there's no need for bad taste and concoctions. Instead, oxy powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[02:07:45.540 --> 02:08:00.540]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of super oxide and ozonide technology. Go to infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com to get started with oxy powder or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:08:15.540 --> 02:08:31.540]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:31.540 --> 02:08:48.540]  Now, for the rest of the hour, Dr. Joseph Merkola is our guest. We're going to be talking Ebola, cancer rates in this country. But also, we're going to talk some about the election. Get his take, I guess, from a nonpartisan position about where this world's going.
[02:08:48.540 --> 02:09:02.540]  And I promise we'll go to some of the callers that are holding as well at the bottom of the hour, like Frogo in England. You can just address your comment and then ask any health question you've got. Dr. Merkola, and then we'll go to Jennifer Angel, Nick, and Jordy.
[02:09:02.540 --> 02:09:17.540]  That'll be it for calls. You've been already holding, so I'll go to you. Dr. Joseph Merkola, if people know anything about health, anything about alternative wellness and news they know about Dr. Merkola, he's probably the most successful one name out there.
[02:09:17.540 --> 02:09:31.540]  He's putting out really good reference material and also being very moderate about the claims and things he says. Merkola.com is the most visited natural health website averaging 14 million visitors monthly. I think it's more than that.
[02:09:31.540 --> 02:09:43.540]  His mission is to ignite a transformation of our fatally flawed healthcare system and to inspire people to take control of their health. And he is a passionate about health and technology for most of his life.
[02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:59.540]  He's a doctor of osteopathic medicine. He treated many thousands of patients for over 20 years. In the mid-1990s, he integrated his passion for natural health with modern technology via the Internet and developing the website, Merkola.com, to spread the word about natural ways to achieve optimal health.
[02:09:59.540 --> 02:10:15.540]  He has significant milestones in his mission to bring people practical solutions to their health problems. New York Times bestselling author. He's also voted the 2009 Ultimate Wellness Game Changer by the Hovegan Post and has been featured in Time Magazine and everywhere else. I'm not going to go over it.
[02:10:15.540 --> 02:10:22.540]  He joins us now to cover the waterfront, basically. Dr. Merkola, thanks for coming on on Halloween.
[02:10:22.540 --> 02:10:29.540]  Yeah, thanks for having me, Alex. I missed you out in September at the Health Liberty Awards.
[02:10:29.540 --> 02:10:35.540]  Well, I would love to be able to go to stuff like that, but I'm always tied down here in the bunker.
[02:10:35.540 --> 02:10:42.540]  You know, I've been trying to actually follow some of what I preach, and I've gotten a lot healthier and lost about all total last few years, about 50 pounds.
[02:10:42.540 --> 02:10:52.540]  I don't look as glowing as you or some of the other folks that really take care of themselves. Let's, out of the gates, talk about Ebola, then I want to talk about the state of labeling.
[02:10:52.540 --> 02:10:57.540]  I know you helped spearhead the prop that almost passed in California. There's other props.
[02:10:57.540 --> 02:11:01.540]  So, Green and Washington this year in Oregon and Colorado.
[02:11:01.540 --> 02:11:08.540]  So, there's a lot to cover. What is your researched expert take on what's currently happening with Ebola?
[02:11:08.540 --> 02:11:19.540]  Well, my belief is that, and no one knows for sure, but it's just my take on it, that it's an orchestrated effort to create a fear.
[02:11:19.540 --> 02:11:28.540]  You know, it's their common strategy, great fear, to use as a justification to initiate a massive vaccination program.
[02:11:28.540 --> 02:11:30.540]  That's clearly the end game here.
[02:11:30.540 --> 02:11:38.540]  I mean, this disease is highly infectious, of course, but it's not taking out a lot of people in the United States.
[02:11:38.540 --> 02:11:44.540]  There's only been two nurses who've been infected. Other people are infected, I mean, in the United States.
[02:11:44.540 --> 02:11:48.540]  There's other people who've been infected who are coming in from Africa.
[02:11:48.540 --> 02:11:56.540]  So, I don't think a lot of people are going to die here. I don't think it's a serious issue, but they're going to use it as leverage to initiate a massive vaccination campaign.
[02:11:56.540 --> 02:12:00.540]  That's clearly what they're doing, and they've got the vaccine lined up to come.
[02:12:00.540 --> 02:12:06.540]  Well, several vaccines for December, January, February, right as this starts to peak in Africa.
[02:12:06.540 --> 02:12:11.540]  Looking at it, we know that South Africa developed race-specific Ebola. They admit that.
[02:12:11.540 --> 02:12:14.540]  It was declassified in hearings back in the mid-90s.
[02:12:14.540 --> 02:12:19.540]  Now, this Ebola clearly has mutated. It lasts longer in the body.
[02:12:19.540 --> 02:12:30.540]  I think people are scared of it because if it gets here and then starts to go somewhat airborne, as the Army has said, in colder weather, it can live longer, then it could be a big problem.
[02:12:30.540 --> 02:12:34.540]  I think it's the bleeding and the rest of it that scares people, but I agree with you.
[02:12:34.540 --> 02:12:40.540]  The government's response, the way they've acted, I think adds to the fear.
[02:12:40.540 --> 02:12:47.540]  How do you think they're going to try to roll out this forced vaccination program or this attempt to fearmonger people into doing it?
[02:12:47.540 --> 02:12:58.540]  I'm not too good at projecting the future, but I do know that very confidently can tell your listeners and viewers that there's nothing to be afraid about here.
[02:12:58.540 --> 02:13:06.540]  Just looked at the facts. I mean, it definitely is a highly virulent virus that kills a large percentage of people in Africa, but look at the people that's killing.
[02:13:06.540 --> 02:13:11.540]  These are highly malnourished individuals, protein-calorie malnutrition, for the most part.
[02:13:11.540 --> 02:13:20.540]  When you have a healthy individual, the mortality rate is going to be far less, and there's very simple ways to improve your immune system.
[02:13:20.540 --> 02:13:34.540]  The two most potent ones would be optimizing your vitamin D levels, and the ideal way is through sun exposure or a tanning bed that will do it naturally.
[02:13:34.540 --> 02:13:42.540]  That's not possible as it will be in the winter months than oral vitamin D, certainly, but realize that that's clearly inferior to sun exposure.
[02:13:42.540 --> 02:13:51.540]  The second one would be 80%. 80% of your immune system, Alex, is in your gut, your gut microbiome.
[02:13:51.540 --> 02:14:02.540]  Simple measures like stopping sugar, avoiding tap water that's not been filtered because the chlorine there will easily decimate your beneficial bacteria,
[02:14:02.540 --> 02:14:10.540]  or bathing in a shower with chlorinated water because you could absorb more chlorine from a hot shower than you can from drinking tap water,
[02:14:10.540 --> 02:14:20.540]  and then having a regular sources of beneficial bacteria. I'm a big fan of fermented foods because you get massively large doses,
[02:14:20.540 --> 02:14:25.540]  literally 10% of your gut microbiome population in just a few ounces.
[02:14:25.540 --> 02:14:33.540]  You do all those together, and your immune system is upregulated, and you can basically eliminate just about any infection,
[02:14:33.540 --> 02:14:40.540]  whether it's Ebola, the flu, coughs, or colds, you won't get sick. You don't need a lot of fancy stuff.
[02:14:40.540 --> 02:14:45.540]  For whatever reason, you're stressed out, you're not sleeping well, you do get sick.
[02:14:45.540 --> 02:14:52.540]  There's simple measures that you can do that really address this that you don't have to rely on medications.
[02:14:52.540 --> 02:14:59.540]  There's simple therapies like certainly liposomal vitamin C, colloidal silver, and even ozone therapy,
[02:14:59.540 --> 02:15:06.540]  which I did a recent interview with Dr. Robert Rowan, who went to Sierra Leone and just got back last week
[02:15:06.540 --> 02:15:13.540]  because the president of Sierra Leone invited him to the country to use ozone therapy to treat Ebola there,
[02:15:13.540 --> 02:15:19.540]  but then the drug companies got aware of it and they got kicked out last week, unfortunately.
[02:15:19.540 --> 02:15:26.540]  But he was able to treat a lot of physicians there, and most likely some of the ozone therapy trials will start soon.
[02:15:26.540 --> 02:15:32.540]  Think how powerful these drug companies are that they can block colloidal silver, they can block ozone treatments,
[02:15:32.540 --> 02:15:37.540]  they can block things that are known in the government's own research to have massive effects,
[02:15:37.540 --> 02:15:43.540]  all because they want to be the saviors to sell the Ebola vaccine or the Ebola drugs.
[02:15:43.540 --> 02:15:48.540]  There's just got to be some way to break their monopoly of control.
[02:15:48.540 --> 02:15:53.540]  Well, there is a way, there's a very clear way, and that is to take control of your health.
[02:15:53.540 --> 02:16:00.540]  That's clearly, to be empowered to understand that you don't have to rely on expensive drugs or surgeries
[02:16:00.540 --> 02:16:07.540]  to address the causes of disease. There are natural options, many of them are inexpensive or virtually free
[02:16:07.540 --> 02:16:13.540]  that could radically improve your ability to stay healthy and not rely on these alternatives.
[02:16:13.540 --> 02:16:21.540]  It's really bizarro world, Dr. Merkola, that people like Cass Sunstein, the White House regulations are,
[02:16:21.540 --> 02:16:27.540]  could put a paper out six years ago saying, we should restrict free speech,
[02:16:27.540 --> 02:16:32.540]  and he gave an example of what was damaging speech, and he said, sunshine is not good for you.
[02:16:32.540 --> 02:16:39.540]  Yeah, and now the Surgeon General who is a former dermatologist, or still is a dermatologist,
[02:16:39.540 --> 02:16:45.540]  but he's massively come against that and tried to integrate into the United States public health policy
[02:16:45.540 --> 02:16:52.540]  to avoid the sun. I mean, it's just so highly irrational.
[02:16:52.540 --> 02:16:59.540]  Well, they don't want us to be well. See, you're a classy smart guy, and you're very conservative in your approach
[02:16:59.540 --> 02:17:05.540]  at not being hysterical, but come on. We've got governments with all their secret lethal tests.
[02:17:05.540 --> 02:17:10.540]  They've been caught over and over again. When they come out and say, don't get sun, you don't need any sun,
[02:17:10.540 --> 02:17:16.540]  when any old fashioned doctor would say you're sick, go get sun, when anybody can read the thousands of studies
[02:17:16.540 --> 02:17:25.540]  that you've got to get moderate sun or you'll basically get cancer, they just, they want a sick dying or dead, I guess.
[02:17:25.540 --> 02:17:31.540]  Well, I'm not sure that's the ultimate motivation of most physicians. I think that, you know, having been trained as a physician,
[02:17:31.540 --> 02:17:35.540]  I don't think the average one, I'm talking about the big policy makers.
[02:17:35.540 --> 02:17:42.540]  Oh, I couldn't agree more. Yeah, there's definitely a consistent effort in that direction.
[02:17:42.540 --> 02:17:48.540]  But the policy, who controls the policy makers? You know, there's this revolving door of federal regulatory agencies
[02:17:48.540 --> 02:17:56.540]  that are bought off by lobbyists from these large corporations, frequently the drug companies, that dictates policies.
[02:17:56.540 --> 02:18:02.540]  Yeah, for those that don't know, that's a great example about in Africa, not letting doctors go in with ozone systems.
[02:18:02.540 --> 02:18:09.540]  Look at Codex Alimentarius and the UN. It's run by the multinational corporations that run the UN board.
[02:18:09.540 --> 02:18:16.540]  Yeah, and it's been successfully implemented from large measure in Europe. And thankfully, we've got tremendously great organizations
[02:18:16.540 --> 02:18:26.540]  like American A&H, I believe it is. I forget what the acronym stands for, but they're using political lobbying to prevent those
[02:18:26.540 --> 02:18:30.540]  laws from being implemented in the United States. You cannot get, I mean, it's just insane.
[02:18:30.540 --> 02:18:36.540]  It's almost impossible to find a natural health care clinician in England or even find any supplement that is useful.
[02:18:36.540 --> 02:18:45.540]  I mean, they're limited to vitamin D to 400 units. You'd have to take 10, 10, 15, 20 a day to get the right dose.
[02:18:45.540 --> 02:18:51.540]  And let's be clear, they jack the price up, they cut the allowance down to almost nothing, and say, oh, you don't need iodine,
[02:18:51.540 --> 02:18:57.540]  oh, you don't need vitamin D, oh, you don't. Listen to these people that say you need vitamins, that you need minerals,
[02:18:57.540 --> 02:19:04.540]  but they're lowering the RDA down and down and down. What's behind that?
[02:19:04.540 --> 02:19:10.540]  Well, I'm not aware that they're lowering specific RDAs, but those are just guidelines.
[02:19:10.540 --> 02:19:18.540]  But the key is to understand that you need healthy food. And one of my big new passions is to encourage and inspire people
[02:19:18.540 --> 02:19:22.540]  to really start growing their own food, even if it's something as simple as sprouts.
[02:19:22.540 --> 02:19:28.540]  I mean, you could have a significant portion of your food intake from sprouts, which you can graze from seed in about seven to 10 days.
[02:19:28.540 --> 02:19:32.540]  So, you know, it's organic, it's really healthy.
[02:19:32.540 --> 02:19:35.540]  Well, stay there, Dr. McCullough. We're going to come back, and I'm going to look it up.
[02:19:35.540 --> 02:19:40.540]  But I remember having some of the folks on that have been there reporting from Codex Alimentarius and singing.
[02:19:40.540 --> 02:19:44.540]  They are lobbying to continue to actually lower in Europe. I don't mean here, but they've done it.
[02:19:44.540 --> 02:19:49.540]  Lower what they're saying. You can basically sell on the store shelves.
[02:19:49.540 --> 02:20:06.540]  We'll be right back. I'm your host, Alex Jones. Dr. McCullough of Mercola.com is our guest. Stay with us.

[02:20:30.540 --> 02:20:37.540]  Hey, Boomer. I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water. Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[02:20:37.540 --> 02:20:45.540]  It's the cleanest, best water ever. Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[02:20:45.540 --> 02:20:54.540]  Right? You love it too. Yeah, I'm thirsty too. Let's go get some. Get Berkey clean water by calling 877-886-3653.

[02:21:25.540 --> 02:21:34.540]  It's already too late. Criminals have kicked in your door and are now in your home. Before this happens, homeowners have a choice.
[02:21:34.540 --> 02:21:43.540]  One, do nothing and hope you aren't one of the 1.4 million families attacked each year. Or two, refuse to be a victim and for as low as $59, reinforce your doors with door devils.
[02:21:43.540 --> 02:21:49.540]  Door devils simply attach to existing door frames and have proven to stop the biggest bad guys from kicking in doors.

[02:21:58.540 --> 02:22:04.540]  The lining of your lungs is supposed to be protected with glutathione to neutralize incoming irritants.
[02:22:04.540 --> 02:22:14.540]  In the absence of enough glutathione, your lungs are more prone to irritation. Listen to the real-world results of one man using a powerful glutathione supporting food.
[02:22:14.540 --> 02:22:22.540]  Hi, my name is Bill O'Brien. I generally suffer through an asthmatic breathing type situation. My breathing is shallow and generally constricted in the nose and lungs.
[02:22:22.540 --> 02:22:28.540]  After consuming one world away today, I have tremendous energy and also notice my breathing is free.
[02:22:28.540 --> 02:22:35.540]  I can feel the air in my left nostril and it is free all the way to my abdomen, which is bitterly remarkable because I rarely get that feeling.
[02:22:35.540 --> 02:22:43.540]  Being a singer, I love feeling this unrestricted voice. The only thing I've actually added to my routine is one world away. Wow.
