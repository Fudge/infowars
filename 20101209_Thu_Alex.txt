[00:00:04.881 --> 00:00:09.707]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.707 --> 00:00:11.309]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.851]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.851 --> 00:00:17.036]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.036 --> 00:00:21.121]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.377 --> 00:00:37.365]  Before I forget, I'm going to say out of the gates, we're scheduled in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast tomorrow to have Senator-elect Rand Paul on.
[00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:44.050]  We've got Ventura with big news on multi-fronts joining us next week, Jesse Ventura.
[00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.532]  Today is going to be a jam-packed transmission as well.
[00:00:47.532 --> 00:00:50.594]  It is the ninth day of December 2010 on this Thursday edition.
[00:00:53.156 --> 00:01:08.351]  We have John Young of Cryptome, really the proto or archetype of Wikileaks and also involved at multi-levels in what you could call the founding of the Wikileaks type system.
[00:01:08.351 --> 00:01:15.638]  He has a lot of inside intel on it, so he'll be joining us coming up in about 45 minutes from now.
[00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:31.919]  We've got Donald Light coming on the broadcast, who is a visiting professor at Stanford University and professor of comparative health care at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, and he has written a book breaking down the
[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.706]  One of the biggest killers, if not the biggest, it's right up there with automobile accidents, are prescription drugs.
[00:01:38.706 --> 00:01:50.557]  So they've got big sys with telescreens going up saying watch for terrorists everywhere and don't trust your neighbor when more people die each year from bee stings than terrorism in this country.
[00:01:50.557 --> 00:01:51.679]  The border is wide open, 28,000 deaths.
[00:01:53.916 --> 00:01:55.437]  You know about that.
[00:01:55.437 --> 00:02:01.061]  And meanwhile, we've got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of deaths from these deadly prescription drugs.
[00:02:01.061 --> 00:02:06.104]  It's well known, but he's done the breakdowns and cross-referenced all the big studies.
[00:02:06.104 --> 00:02:08.966]  So Donald Light coming on about that.
[00:02:08.966 --> 00:02:12.168]  One of the most dangerous things in our society.
[00:02:12.168 --> 00:02:16.550]  Now, it's not as scary looking as a man wearing a turban.
[00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.231]  I'll give you that.
[00:02:18.735 --> 00:02:25.899]  And it's not as much fun to run around and be afraid at night and hide under your bed from prescription drugs.
[00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:31.363]  But it is arguably the number one cause of unnatural death in this nation.
[00:02:31.363 --> 00:02:33.224]  And that's the government's own admissions.
[00:02:33.224 --> 00:02:35.785]  That, oh, it's killing 300-plus thou a year.
[00:02:35.785 --> 00:02:38.307]  It's probably a lot more than that.
[00:02:38.307 --> 00:02:40.008]  Flesh-eating bacteria.
[00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:43.910]  Infections out of hospitals and clinics are killing a couple hundred thou a year.
[00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.052]  And don't worry, they'll just keep giving antibiotics to people who don't need them.
[00:02:48.805 --> 00:02:52.188]  You better only take antibiotics if you can't whip it.
[00:02:52.188 --> 00:02:58.014]  I've had strep throat and things before for two weeks and I won't take it until I beat it.
[00:02:58.014 --> 00:03:06.661]  Not because I don't know antibiotics are great, it's because I don't want to lower my immunity and then also contribute to growing more and more deadly bacteria.
[00:03:06.661 --> 00:03:14.028]  One time I did break down though and take antibiotics when a security guard jumped out of nowhere at the
[00:03:15.856 --> 00:03:16.777]  Supreme Court building.
[00:03:16.777 --> 00:03:25.381]  I'd walked up on a Sunday when Bilderberg had ended, and we were there shooting some video of different government buildings for cutaway shots and films.
[00:03:25.381 --> 00:03:28.943]  In fact, you see the shots in the fall of the Republican-Obama deception.
[00:03:28.943 --> 00:03:31.124]  And a cop jumps out and says, what are you doing?
[00:03:31.124 --> 00:03:37.468]  So I kind of hoo and turned towards him, and the feet on the pillars are about two feet tall.
[00:03:37.468 --> 00:03:42.531]  And I turned and just gashed my shin through the jeans, cut my shin,
[00:03:43.191 --> 00:03:47.693]  And I didn't really, I kind of ignored it at the time, there was a little bit of bleeding.
[00:03:47.693 --> 00:04:04.999]  And so I make the joke that the Supreme Court building bit me because a month later I had pus just pouring out of my leg and they did x-rays and they found out it was rotting, I guess kind of a gangrenous type bacteria under the skin all around the bone.
[00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:09.181]  And so thank God for those antibiotics or it'd have been, saw my left leg off.
[00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:11.542]  So I'm not saying antibiotics aren't magical.
[00:04:12.222 --> 00:04:14.283]  Very important since they're being overused.
[00:04:14.283 --> 00:04:18.786]  So now we got flesh-eating bacteria running wild everywhere, different forms of it.
[00:04:18.786 --> 00:04:22.629]  I've already just gotten distracted off here at the start of the broadcast.
[00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:24.070]  I'm very good at that.
[00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.672]  So we have John Young, Donald Light, and Lord Monckton joining us from Cancun.
[00:04:28.672 --> 00:04:30.193]  Boy, big news there.
[00:04:30.193 --> 00:04:36.858]  Ted Turner in the UN saying global one-child policy, 95% population reductions.
[00:04:36.858 --> 00:04:39.960]  We've got to shut down the industrial society, on and on and on.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.444]  Total brazen criminality masquerading as saviors of the world.
[00:04:44.444 --> 00:04:52.212]  He'll be joining us from Cancun, there on the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, in the war-torn region.
[00:04:52.212 --> 00:04:57.538]  And we'll get into a lot more coming up on WikiLeaks, the economy, you name it, straight ahead.
[00:04:57.538 --> 00:04:58.579]  Key Intel, stay with us.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.701]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:04.701 --> 00:05:05.621]  Number 1.
[00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:09.042]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:09.902]  Number 2.
[00:05:09.902 --> 00:05:14.783]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:14.783 --> 00:05:15.523]  It's true.
[00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:20.404]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:20.404 --> 00:05:21.224]  Number 3.
[00:05:21.224 --> 00:05:24.805]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:24.805 --> 00:05:28.506]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:28.726 --> 00:05:29.527]  Number 4.
[00:05:29.527 --> 00:05:32.290]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.974]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:35.974 --> 00:05:36.755]  Number 5.
[00:05:36.755 --> 00:05:40.900]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.665]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:45.945 --> 00:05:50.128]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:50.128 --> 00:05:51.909]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:54.151]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:05:54.151 --> 00:05:56.513]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:06:01.303 --> 00:06:05.327]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:05.327 --> 00:06:08.571]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:13.376]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:13.376 --> 00:06:19.763]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:19.763 --> 00:06:22.006]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:06:22.526 --> 00:06:22.826]  Tim Geithner?
[00:06:22.826 --> 00:06:23.347]  Bernanke?
[00:06:23.347 --> 00:06:23.847]  They're arsonists!
[00:06:23.847 --> 00:06:25.108]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:25.108 --> 00:06:27.550]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.805]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:48.709]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:57.839]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:07:01.837 --> 00:07:05.798]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:05.798 --> 00:07:14.661]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:07:14.661 --> 00:07:19.282]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:07:19.282 --> 00:07:30.106]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:07:30.746 --> 00:07:40.248]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:40.248 --> 00:07:45.670]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:53.171]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:53.171 --> 00:07:55.932]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:08:00.734 --> 00:08:05.737]  Ciscommunications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.737 --> 00:08:10.700]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.902]  It is Thursday, 9th day of December 2010.
[00:08:13.902 --> 00:08:16.744]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:08:16.744 --> 00:08:23.228]  Lord Christopher Monckton joins us from the criminal summit, where the globalists are
[00:08:24.881 --> 00:08:34.906]  Camouflaging their world government feudal takeover, their world government establishment of feudalism, is what they're attempting.
[00:08:34.906 --> 00:08:39.968]  He'll be joining us from Cancun, coming up in the last hour, Donald Light.
[00:08:39.968 --> 00:08:46.431]  Again, a researcher and author dealing with how the prescription drugs are causing so many hundreds of thousands of deaths each year.
[00:08:47.031 --> 00:08:57.716]  Here in the United States alone and John Young of Cryptome is going to be joining us as well coming up here in about 35 minutes from now.
[00:08:57.716 --> 00:09:02.219]  Let me just dive straight into the news and information.
[00:09:02.219 --> 00:09:06.221]  We will have Rand Paul, Senator-elect, last 30 minutes of the broadcast tomorrow.
[00:09:06.221 --> 00:09:08.922]  I want to just throw that tidbit out there.
[00:09:08.922 --> 00:09:10.503]  We have some other big surprise guests.
[00:09:11.323 --> 00:09:19.638]  Key Intel coming up on the transmission next week of course and I'll also be live this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:09:19.638 --> 00:09:20.920]  Central Standard Time.
[00:09:22.234 --> 00:09:34.601]  The London Telegraph has reported on 2010's top searches and it's the Google Zeitgeist, top searches of 2010.
[00:09:34.601 --> 00:09:41.145]  We've actually been listed in these before, before we started having Google bombs and having listeners do that.
[00:09:43.097 --> 00:09:50.782]  Films like Endgame, Obama Deception, The Name Alex Jones, Infowars.com, showing up as top search trends.
[00:09:50.782 --> 00:09:52.804]  And you can actually see that on the Google Trends.
[00:09:52.804 --> 00:09:58.728]  You'll notice Alex Jones is always being searched and is always in the top 100 searches or so.
[00:09:58.728 --> 00:10:03.151]  And again, that's not, oh look, people are searching my name, aren't I important?
[00:10:03.151 --> 00:10:09.375]  It's an indicator of the fact that we're having such a big effect.
[00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:10.176]  But over the year,
[00:10:12.157 --> 00:10:24.228]  Alex Jones was the 10th most popular search result in the news and current events section of Google Analytics.
[00:10:24.228 --> 00:10:27.851]  So throughout the year Alex Jones was number 10.
[00:10:27.851 --> 00:10:30.794]  Other results were Election 2010, Rail Strike, Democrat,
[00:10:37.711 --> 00:10:39.272]  Things like that.
[00:10:39.272 --> 00:10:43.374]  So very, very interesting to show the effect that we're having overall there.
[00:10:43.374 --> 00:10:48.897]  That from the London Telegraph today with the headline, Google Zeitgeist Top Searches for 2010.
[00:10:51.539 --> 00:10:55.222]  Okay, let's get into the financial news right now.
[00:10:55.222 --> 00:10:57.244]  This is really scary.
[00:10:57.244 --> 00:11:05.451]  You notice interest rates are actually going up now on mortgages, even though the official lending rate is basically zero for the big megabanks.
[00:11:05.451 --> 00:11:11.956]  They get the Federal Reserve large S backed up by taxpayer money at basically zero percent.
[00:11:12.957 --> 00:11:25.691]  And then we have to go out and get loans from them, and you've seen credit cards go up now, in many cases above 30%, whereas there was low lending on mortgages in the attempt to get the economy going.
[00:11:25.691 --> 00:11:28.153]  Those have now spiked up in the last month.
[00:11:28.153 --> 00:11:29.334]  Why is all this happening?
[00:11:29.334 --> 00:11:32.217]  Because the decision has been made to devalue the dollar.
[00:11:32.918 --> 00:11:33.038]  It's
[00:11:56.991 --> 00:11:57.511]  We're good to go.
[00:12:16.112 --> 00:12:30.558]  And short-term, as Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and other economists have explained here, as the dollar plunges, countries go in and try to buy it to prop it up because they've already been held hostage by having such giant holdings in it.
[00:12:30.558 --> 00:12:36.541]  But now they're realizing, well, it doesn't matter if we try to prop it up short-term.
[00:12:36.541 --> 00:12:40.183]  Over the long-term aggregate, or even on a yearly graph, which is mid-term,
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:57.392]  The dollar is being devalued and the writing is on the wall so that is a big deal and all other major currencies are going to follow this as well until all currencies are debased and then they will of course then force everyone on to the SDR that's already in full operation which is a completely digital
[00:12:57.932 --> 00:13:18.600]  Cashless system run by the IMF and World Bank and to give the quote currency digital currency some backup and some supposed value it will be under the credit and faith of the planet and the carbon taxes the VAT taxes the Tobin taxes the travel taxes all paid directly to the bankers that have engineered this collapse.
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.302]  And now we're seeing more evidence of that.
[00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:29.606]  CNBC bond prices plunge for second day on deficit fears.
[00:13:29.606 --> 00:13:29.846]  U.S.
[00:13:29.846 --> 00:13:44.996]  Treasuries plunged yesterday, Wednesday extending Tuesday's sharp losses and pushing benchmark yields to a six-month high after a deal in Washington to extend tax cuts fueled fears of inflation and swelling budget deficit.
[00:13:46.101 --> 00:13:48.443]  So it continues from there.
[00:13:48.443 --> 00:14:01.155]  See, if they don't suppress the economy and have a depression on Main Street, all of these tens of trillions of dollars pumped into the global markets will cause inflation.
[00:14:01.155 --> 00:14:05.919]  So that's why the banks don't loan this money out to the general public.
[00:14:05.919 --> 00:14:06.920]  They're freezing it.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.704]  The money is only for them to use to consolidate and buy up infrastructure.
[00:14:11.584 --> 00:14:14.408]  But in my view, they're already inflating
[00:14:28.226 --> 00:14:28.726]  I don't know.
[00:14:45.607 --> 00:14:46.927]  Continuing, U.S.
[00:14:46.927 --> 00:14:50.548]  Treasuries hit by biggest sell-off in two years.
[00:14:50.548 --> 00:14:52.929]  People are not buying them.
[00:14:52.929 --> 00:15:05.771]  When the Treasury offers them on the open market, people aren't buying them, so you're having record monetization of the private Federal Reserve that takes our tax money, we have to back this up, and then buys U.S.
[00:15:05.771 --> 00:15:07.071]  debt.
[00:15:07.071 --> 00:15:09.072]  And then, of course, they get the interest on it.
[00:15:09.072 --> 00:15:09.652]  Out of nothing!
[00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:16.652]  And China is the biggest owner of treasuries, but right behind them is the private Federal Reserve.
[00:15:16.652 --> 00:15:25.554]  And if this continues, by the middle of next year, CNBC has even reported that the Federal Reserve, the private cartel, will be the biggest owner of our debts.
[00:15:25.554 --> 00:15:29.195]  So the private banker is completely owning us.
[00:15:29.195 --> 00:15:29.455]  U.S.
[00:15:29.455 --> 00:15:38.718]  Treasury suffered their biggest two-day sell-off since the collapse of Lehman Brothers following a torrid month that has seen borrowing costs for Western governments soar.
[00:15:38.718 --> 00:15:40.959]  See, Germany,
[00:15:42.179 --> 00:15:55.782]  Portugal, Greece, Ireland, the nation's cost to borrow money from the private central banks that we the people back up and fund with taxes, that cost is going up.
[00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:02.552]  And it's been even reported by the Irish newspapers that this debt is not owed by the Irish people.
[00:16:02.552 --> 00:16:04.593]  It's the bank's derivatives debt.
[00:16:04.593 --> 00:16:11.355]  But they're saying, sorry, Ireland will now be totally owned by offshore banks, and we're raising your taxes and cutting your benefits.
[00:16:11.355 --> 00:16:12.876]  I mean, it's just pure robbery.
[00:16:13.638 --> 00:16:18.179]  And people say, oh, the Irish, you know, they, you know, the Greeks, it's their fault.
[00:16:18.179 --> 00:16:19.920]  We're all in the same boat together.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.460]  We're all being sucked dry.
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:28.082]  It's just happening in a domino effect where the globalists suck one country dry and then move on to the next.
[00:16:28.082 --> 00:16:32.783]  That's always been the model that they've used over and over again.
[00:16:32.783 --> 00:16:37.564]  So, continuing here, Germany, Japan, and the U.S.
[00:16:37.564 --> 00:16:39.145]  have all seen their benchmark
[00:16:40.529 --> 00:16:49.335]  Market interest rates rise by more than a quarter in the past month, while the UK has risen by nearly a fifth.
[00:16:49.335 --> 00:16:53.958]  You could argue that we are at the next stage where the global cost of capital goes higher and higher.
[00:16:53.958 --> 00:17:00.242]  See, the bankers have ordered the thousands of trillions, and they've got all these toxic assets.
[00:17:00.242 --> 00:17:01.623]  They hold everybody hostage.
[00:17:01.623 --> 00:17:08.648]  The governments raise taxes, pump money into the banks, and then the banks say, okay, now I'm gonna raise the price for you.
[00:17:10.387 --> 00:17:14.608]  For you to get that loan, whether you're a government or a corporation or individual.
[00:17:14.608 --> 00:17:17.949]  I mean, it's total global consolidation.
[00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:29.033]  You could argue that we are in the next stage where the global cost of capital goes higher and higher, and that's the inflation, said Stephen Major, Global Head of Fixed Income Research, HSBC.
[00:17:29.033 --> 00:17:30.513]  Oh, but what do you get at your bank?
[00:17:30.513 --> 00:17:34.615]  You might get 1%, but the bankers, they get 30% on your credit card.
[00:17:34.615 --> 00:17:35.295]  You figuring this out?
[00:17:36.496 --> 00:17:38.677]  The yields on a 10-year U.S.
[00:17:38.677 --> 00:17:48.284]  Treasuries hit a six-month high of 3.33% on Wednesday, up 0.39% points from Monday, and 1% higher than its October low.
[00:17:48.284 --> 00:17:55.229]  Japanese five-year yields also rose the most in two years, while Germany's benchmark borrowed cost hit 3%.
[00:17:55.229 --> 00:18:04.655]  People are getting out of the market and moving to the sidelines, feeling shell-shocked at the speed of the rise in yields, said David Adler, strategist for CRT Capital.
[00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:09.731]  And it just goes on from there.
[00:18:09.731 --> 00:18:11.232]  This is big, big news.
[00:18:11.232 --> 00:18:21.620]  The market moves came after President Obama agreed with Congressional Republicans to extend Bush-era tax cuts and combine them with a $120 billion payroll tax holiday.
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:28.506]  But investors and traders were divided on whether this was sufficient to explain the recent global spike in yields.
[00:18:31.969 --> 00:18:33.410]  And here's the key.
[00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:42.398]  The primary explanation is that growth expectations have increased because of better economic data and the second stimulus provided by the U.S.
[00:18:42.398 --> 00:18:43.019]  government.
[00:18:43.019 --> 00:18:45.821]  But others argue it could be due to fears that the U.S.
[00:18:45.821 --> 00:18:51.747]  Federal Reserve will not follow through on asset purchases or because of higher government deficits.
[00:18:51.747 --> 00:18:54.089]  It is probably all three, said Mr. Major.
[00:18:57.341 --> 00:18:58.422]  So, it continues.
[00:18:58.422 --> 00:19:01.663]  And by the way, they tried to suppress gold and silver the last three days.
[00:19:01.663 --> 00:19:08.707]  They're both shooting right back up to those all-time highs right now, today.
[00:19:08.707 --> 00:19:13.689]  Okay, in other news, again, Monckton's coming up in the last hour.
[00:19:13.689 --> 00:19:15.650]  They are at the Copenhagen Summit.
[00:19:17.059 --> 00:19:30.769]  Part two in, that's what they're calling it, part two in Cancun, Mexico, openly trying to get rid of the UN treaty signed decades ago banning chemtrailing or geoengineering.
[00:19:30.769 --> 00:19:36.494]  They're actually down there admitting they just want to go public with their manipulation of the weather that's already going on.
[00:19:37.657 --> 00:19:37.937]  I don't know.
[00:19:56.089 --> 00:20:00.670]  Dealing with some class action lawsuits dealing with secret DNA databases.
[00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:01.190]  Fact.
[00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:08.272]  Wood-burning stoves, factory smokestacks, smog, and chemical fumes in the home are all sources of air contamination that can make you sick.
[00:20:08.272 --> 00:20:15.813]  Your exposure to airborne toxic particulate matter and volatile organic compounds every day may be the cause of fatigue, flu-like symptoms, or worse.
[00:20:15.813 --> 00:20:19.274]  These are bad conditions for the very young, older, and the chemically sensitive.

[00:21:04.548 --> 00:21:05.808]  Tyranny is here.
[00:21:05.808 --> 00:21:09.530]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:11.971]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:21:11.971 --> 00:21:17.833]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:21:17.833 --> 00:21:24.075]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:21:24.495 --> 00:21:30.480]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:34.663]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:21:34.663 --> 00:21:38.947]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:21:38.947 --> 00:21:44.912]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:21:44.912 --> 00:21:48.455]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:21:48.455 --> 00:21:50.436]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:21:50.436 --> 00:21:50.877]  It's here.

[00:21:59.255 --> 00:22:05.918]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:05.918 --> 00:22:14.041]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:14.041 --> 00:22:21.885]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:22.205 --> 00:22:27.291]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:27.291 --> 00:22:32.516]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:32.516 --> 00:22:36.861]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:36.861 --> 00:22:37.962]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[00:24:16.787 --> 00:24:30.875]  Every time I mention DynCorp or Halliburton running giant child kidnapping rings, I get sent comments or see emails of people saying, what are you talking about?
[00:24:30.875 --> 00:24:43.082]  Well, we've probably written 20, 30 articles, I haven't counted them up, over the years at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, linking to BBC, AP, Reuters, you name it.
[00:24:44.875 --> 00:24:58.141]  DynCorp runs, in the United States, the biggest percentage of private contractors that are CPS agents, kidnapping your children, no judge, no jury, no due process.
[00:24:58.141 --> 00:25:03.943]  But I'm talking about overseas predominantly, but also in Latin America.
[00:25:03.943 --> 00:25:07.025]  DynCorp, Halliburton, they don't just kidnap women and children.
[00:25:07.945 --> 00:25:08.986]  They kidnap men.
[00:25:08.986 --> 00:25:19.451]  It's come out in major newspapers like the Chicago Tribune and take them to third world countries in giant slave camps and have them work in brick factories.
[00:25:19.451 --> 00:25:27.236]  Eastern European men, Arab men, I mean, it's like slavery 300 years ago.
[00:25:27.236 --> 00:25:29.697]  And it comes out and then nobody gets in trouble.
[00:25:29.697 --> 00:25:34.980]  But it's interesting, people are now going through the tens of thousands of WikiLeaks documents
[00:25:36.269 --> 00:25:43.097]  And the Houston Press is reporting on and links to other mainstream news articles about it.
[00:25:43.097 --> 00:25:49.545]  WikiLeaks, Texas company helped pimp little boys to stoned Afghan cops.
[00:25:49.545 --> 00:25:56.092]  And this is just a State Department cable with the Afghans complaining because you know, I mean,
[00:25:59.198 --> 00:26:04.300]  It's come out with Blackwater and the cocaine parties and the naked men all wallowing around in federal court.
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:10.202]  That's come out and going outside at night naked in Baghdad and just shooting up cars for fun.
[00:26:10.202 --> 00:26:16.624]  I mean, and we're like, that's our patriotic men from DynCorp.
[00:26:16.624 --> 00:26:19.245]  That's our patriotic men.
[00:26:19.245 --> 00:26:21.406]  Excuse me, DynCorp is with the sex slaverings worldwide.
[00:26:21.406 --> 00:26:22.086]  I'm sorry.
[00:26:22.086 --> 00:26:25.948]  That's our patriotic men from Blackwater now exceed.
[00:26:29.175 --> 00:26:30.796]  That's who they hire.
[00:26:30.796 --> 00:26:33.098]  That's what they do.
[00:26:33.098 --> 00:26:33.799]  Okay?
[00:26:33.799 --> 00:26:36.441]  That's their business at DynCorp.
[00:26:36.441 --> 00:26:42.526]  I mean, I could play the Congressional hearings right now for you.
[00:26:42.526 --> 00:26:43.567]  I've played them many times.
[00:26:43.567 --> 00:26:52.114]  You just go to YouTube and type in, Congressional hearing brings up DynCorp and child kidnapping.
[00:26:52.114 --> 00:26:55.837]  And they ask Rumsfeld about it in the committee hearing, and why didn't they get in trouble?
[00:26:55.837 --> 00:26:57.118]  And he says, oh, they don't get in trouble.
[00:27:00.199 --> 00:27:01.500]  And they just kind of laugh about it.
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:05.242]  It's funny to them.
[00:27:05.242 --> 00:27:20.210]  And so when I get up here and I explain to you this is going on, I have seen hundreds of mainstream news articles about UN peacekeepers, DynCorp, the UN, every month, no matter where they are.
[00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:24.512]  Haiti, in the Caribbean, or Africa, or Asia, or Central Asia.
[00:27:24.512 --> 00:27:26.513]  It doesn't matter.
[00:27:26.513 --> 00:27:28.514]  That's who these people are.
[00:27:28.514 --> 00:27:29.475]  That's what they do.
[00:27:32.103 --> 00:27:42.108]  And it's come out in Italian television, tied in with some of these big contractor groups and organizations in the US with snuff films.
[00:27:43.451 --> 00:27:48.132]  And I've seen the English translations of the Italian newspapers on this stuff.
[00:27:48.132 --> 00:28:00.355]  The whole world knows about this, but the average American, where it'll describe two male toddlers and what they do to them, and then they blow their heads off with a revolver on video.
[00:28:00.355 --> 00:28:01.736]  This is sold in the US.
[00:28:10.057 --> 00:28:16.759]  And I've walked up to cops in front of the DynCorp building in Austin and said, you know, that's DynCorp.
[00:28:16.759 --> 00:28:18.019]  They've been in the news involved in this.
[00:28:18.019 --> 00:28:19.720]  You guys want to bust some real criminals.
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.620]  And the cops all laughed at me.
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:27.082]  And then one of them said, the commander said, yeah, I work for them.
[00:28:27.082 --> 00:28:28.762]  I do work for them and laughed at me.
[00:28:28.762 --> 00:28:31.423]  And they had all this demonic look on their faces.
[00:28:31.423 --> 00:28:33.804]  Like when they hear about real crime, it's funny.
[00:28:33.804 --> 00:28:34.844]  Oh, it's real funny.
[00:28:35.805 --> 00:28:57.303]  It's like that FBI agent I called the Threat Fusion Center two days ago, the videos up on InfoWars and Prison Planet, and I said, here's Anwar al-Awlaki, mainstream news, top al-Qaeda, secretly hanging out at the Pentagon, and he's behind all the recent attacks, and all the patsies, and I want to report on bombs in Building 7, and I want to send you the videos of this, and the guy said, alright, here's the P.O.
[00:28:57.303 --> 00:28:58.264]  box, and hung up on me.
[00:29:00.077 --> 00:29:03.199]  I'd have called up and said, my neighbor's doing something in their garage.
[00:29:03.199 --> 00:29:04.280]  They got guns.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.881]  That guy would have been, what?
[00:29:05.881 --> 00:29:08.022]  Okay, let me write this down right now.
[00:29:08.022 --> 00:29:09.743]  Oh, a citizen we can throw in jail?
[00:29:09.743 --> 00:29:12.425]  Oh, let me get on him right now.
[00:29:12.425 --> 00:29:13.986]  Oh, I saw an old lady.
[00:29:13.986 --> 00:29:15.988]  She isn't recycling her newspaper.
[00:29:15.988 --> 00:29:16.928]  Oh, we'll call the police.
[00:29:16.928 --> 00:29:18.389]  There'll be an environmental officer there.
[00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:19.390]  Give her a fine.
[00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:22.092]  Good job, but you like to work for us as a spy in the community?
[00:29:22.092 --> 00:29:24.353]  I mean, that's all this is.
[00:29:24.353 --> 00:29:26.434]  Do you hear your neighbors criticizing the government?
[00:29:26.434 --> 00:29:27.055]  That's on record.
[00:29:28.564 --> 00:29:30.584]  But oh, let me tell you who the actual terrorists are.
[00:29:30.584 --> 00:29:31.765]  I have smoking guns.
[00:29:31.765 --> 00:29:33.205]  I have government documents where they planned 9-11.
[00:29:33.205 --> 00:29:35.565]  I'm not going to talk to you.
[00:29:35.565 --> 00:29:36.886]  Click.
[00:29:36.886 --> 00:29:41.587]  Officers, DynCorp, they're involved in giant child kidnapping rings worldwide.
[00:29:41.587 --> 00:29:43.207]  And they run the local CPS.
[00:29:43.207 --> 00:29:44.787]  I know, I work for them.
[00:29:44.787 --> 00:29:48.408]  Alex, get out of here.
[00:29:48.408 --> 00:29:50.749]  You think you're safe from the New World Order cops?
[00:29:50.749 --> 00:29:52.129]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.129 --> 00:29:54.669]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.669 --> 00:29:57.350]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:04.511 --> 00:30:05.751]  Tyranny is here.
[00:30:05.751 --> 00:30:09.692]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:30:09.692 --> 00:30:12.093]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:30:12.093 --> 00:30:17.794]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:30:17.794 --> 00:30:24.455]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:30:24.455 --> 00:30:30.436]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:30:30.436 --> 00:30:34.137]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:30:34.617 --> 00:30:38.900]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:44.844]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:30:44.844 --> 00:30:48.407]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:30:48.407 --> 00:30:50.368]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:30:50.368 --> 00:30:51.509]  It's here.

[00:31:09.767 --> 00:31:14.531]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.
[00:31:14.531 --> 00:31:18.274]  Now it's that time of year again, and their holiday special is here.

[00:31:59.858 --> 00:32:04.401]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:04.401 --> 00:32:05.322]  Number 1.
[00:32:05.322 --> 00:32:08.745]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:08.745 --> 00:32:09.605]  Number 2.
[00:32:09.605 --> 00:32:14.509]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:14.509 --> 00:32:15.249]  It's true.
[00:32:15.249 --> 00:32:20.113]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:20.113 --> 00:32:20.954]  Number 3.
[00:32:20.954 --> 00:32:24.536]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:24.536 --> 00:32:28.219]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:28.419 --> 00:32:29.220]  Number 4.
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:31.982]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:31.982 --> 00:32:35.665]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:35.665 --> 00:32:36.445]  Number 5.
[00:32:36.445 --> 00:32:40.608]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:40.608 --> 00:32:45.372]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:45.652 --> 00:32:49.816]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:49.816 --> 00:32:51.617]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:51.617 --> 00:32:53.859]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:32:53.859 --> 00:32:56.161]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:32:56.161 --> 00:32:58.463]  What we've got here is failure to communicate.
[00:32:58.463 --> 00:33:00.845]  Some men you just can't reach.
[00:33:11.676 --> 00:33:16.918]  So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it.
[00:33:16.918 --> 00:33:18.079]  Well, he is.
[00:33:18.079 --> 00:33:27.143]  I don't like it any more than you do.
[00:33:27.143 --> 00:33:29.764]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:29.764 --> 00:33:32.765]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:32.765 --> 00:33:37.227]  Coming up in about 12 minutes, John Young of CripTome.org.
[00:33:41.199 --> 00:33:44.960]  Even the New York Observer calls the granddaddy of the whole WikiLeaks type movement.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:48.501]  He'll be joining us with his inside intel on WikiLeaks.
[00:33:48.501 --> 00:34:00.143]  We've got Lord Monckton coming up in the last hour from Cancun, Mexico, where they're again openly promoting eugenics, forced population reduction, world government.
[00:34:00.143 --> 00:34:08.845]  I was getting into the latest WikiLeaks tables with DynCorp involved peddling little boys.
[00:34:08.845 --> 00:34:09.205]  Well, that's
[00:34:11.024 --> 00:34:18.487]  See, their security operations are a cover for trafficking in illegal things.
[00:34:18.487 --> 00:34:20.568]  And they've got diplomatic immunity.
[00:34:20.568 --> 00:34:27.031]  Just like they're always catching UN ambassadors and people and workers shipping drugs, sex slaves in their houses.
[00:34:27.031 --> 00:34:30.072]  You see that every few months in the news because they're above the law.
[00:34:31.107 --> 00:34:33.108]  So I just want you to know that's coming up.
[00:34:33.108 --> 00:34:36.630]  Also, class action filed over newborn babies' blood.
[00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:38.011]  It's now becoming mainstream news.
[00:34:38.011 --> 00:34:43.393]  You notice these suits are all being filed in Austin because we've been talking about it for 15 years.
[00:34:43.393 --> 00:34:54.179]  They're taking babies' blood at birth, and they now, in one suit they settled, got the documents, as I told people they would, that the Army has a secret DNA database.
[00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:56.340]  So now there's a new suit on that.
[00:34:57.745 --> 00:35:00.508]  And the Army pays the hospitals to take your blood.
[00:35:00.508 --> 00:35:06.155]  It's through the Health Department, which was set up over 100 years ago as the Racial Hygiene Department.
[00:35:06.155 --> 00:35:07.716]  The U.S.
[00:35:07.716 --> 00:35:13.943]  government controlling the health departments has sterilized millions of Americans from the 1920s right through the 1980s.
[00:35:15.465 --> 00:35:22.948]  So if they come and grab you in a truck and take you and chop your uterus out, oh, they didn't just tie their tubes, they went inside.
[00:35:22.948 --> 00:35:25.209]  Sometimes they do medical surgeries for fun.
[00:35:25.209 --> 00:35:26.469]  They'd kill people sometimes.
[00:35:26.469 --> 00:35:28.110]  They'd kill newborn babies.
[00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:31.411]  Of course they take your blood secretly for a DNA database.
[00:35:31.411 --> 00:35:36.973]  People had to catch them in the 80s and stop the secret sterilizations and the kidnappings.
[00:35:36.973 --> 00:35:39.734]  So of course they're taking your blood secretly.
[00:35:39.734 --> 00:35:41.654]  That's now ABC News.
[00:35:44.155 --> 00:35:45.616]  They're still trying to whitewash it.
[00:35:45.616 --> 00:35:47.777]  Oh, the Pentagon has your blood.
[00:35:47.777 --> 00:35:50.219]  Gee, they think you're cattle.
[00:35:50.219 --> 00:35:52.801]  They think they own you, okay?
[00:35:52.801 --> 00:35:55.863]  I was telling you about Dyncor and child kidnapping yesterday.
[00:35:55.863 --> 00:35:58.365]  Here it is in the WikiLeaks from the U.S.
[00:35:58.365 --> 00:36:03.288]  government, going, gee, the Afghans are getting mad about them taking their kids.
[00:36:03.288 --> 00:36:07.150]  Here in America, we just go, oh, the neighbor saw me spank my kid?
[00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:10.853]  Here, Dyncor, ship little Bobby to Saudi Arabia.
[00:36:10.853 --> 00:36:12.094]  They like to rape children.
[00:36:13.507 --> 00:36:15.469]  I do what law enforcement says!
[00:36:15.469 --> 00:36:16.850]  Alright, I'm going to shut up.
[00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:21.774]  I'm just getting really angry and really tired of people being in denial out there.
[00:36:21.774 --> 00:36:25.938]  Grow up and realize how much trouble we're in.
[00:36:25.938 --> 00:36:27.600]  There's pure evil going on all around us.
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:30.002]  Just the average person is in denial.
[00:36:30.002 --> 00:36:31.483]  I'm not in denial.
[00:36:31.483 --> 00:36:33.505]  Alright.
[00:36:33.505 --> 00:36:37.148]  I'm going to get off the high horse, but I'm not on a high horse.
[00:36:37.148 --> 00:36:37.729]  I'm angry.
[00:36:39.491 --> 00:36:41.653]  I'm angry and I'm sick of it.
[00:36:41.653 --> 00:36:49.120]  And I'm not the weirdo because I'm angry about major defense contractors involved in every crime you can imagine.
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:52.362]  On record, they never get in trouble.
[00:36:52.362 --> 00:37:05.574]  Now, for the next 10 minutes, I want to go to Steve Schenck of efoodsdirect.com because he's got a Christmas special that he's running right now that is so important.
[00:37:07.642 --> 00:37:21.645]  We need to get self-sufficient, and this is the storable food company I support, that I believe in, and just like he told you a year and a half ago, because he manufactures and puts his own food, you know, all produced in America together, non-GMO, non-hybrid, doesn't have the additives in it.
[00:37:21.645 --> 00:37:23.945]  He saw the prices going up for wholesalers.
[00:37:23.945 --> 00:37:27.066]  Now the media is talking about the food bubble.
[00:37:27.066 --> 00:37:28.326]  Well, it's not a food bubble.
[00:37:28.326 --> 00:37:33.307]  The dollar's being devalued globally, and food is traded worldwide still on the dollar.
[00:37:33.307 --> 00:37:36.368]  Steve Schenck, first off, you were right about food prices going up.
[00:37:36.368 --> 00:37:37.268]  They're going up globally.
[00:37:38.359 --> 00:37:44.543]  Well, it doesn't take brain surgery to figure out what's going on with this thing.
[00:37:44.543 --> 00:37:56.171]  The fascinating experience that we're having is they're pumping a whole bunch of goofy money into the economy, which is devaluing the dollar, at the same time we've got foreclosure rates.
[00:37:56.171 --> 00:37:59.153]  By the way, on the foreclosure rates, Alex, it's absolutely absurd.
[00:37:59.153 --> 00:38:07.058]  You hear about the percentages each month, but you don't hear about the cumulative stuff, the people that are still out of their homes from a year ago.
[00:38:08.095 --> 00:38:08.495]  I don't know.
[00:38:23.821 --> 00:38:30.706]  Now they're wanting to control the ability of us to grow our own and to be able to traffic in food.
[00:38:54.101 --> 00:39:03.785]  Yeah, and then we've got Gerald Zelente, where he's coming out with the absolute facts about what he has predicted before, which he's been absolutely right on.
[00:39:03.785 --> 00:39:06.907]  And now he's talking strictly about food.
[00:39:06.907 --> 00:39:11.449]  We're in the fifth year of that worldwide famine, Alex, that you and I have talked about regularly.
[00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:16.914]  We got people not just buying the treasuries now, they're dumping their treasuries.
[00:39:16.914 --> 00:39:17.895]  Absolutely.
[00:39:17.895 --> 00:39:19.216]  Absolutely.
[00:39:19.216 --> 00:39:31.727]  And the fact is that Stellante has come out very strongly with regard to exactly what is going to solve the individual family's problem.
[00:39:31.727 --> 00:39:38.893]  We can't do much about all this New World Order stuff except be aware of it and adjust for it, but the solution that we have
[00:39:39.488 --> 00:39:40.689]  There's only one.
[00:39:40.689 --> 00:39:42.369]  It's gotta be, it's gotta be food.
[00:39:42.369 --> 00:39:50.753]  You know, right now, in fact, in Salenti's last article that we were reading here at the office just the other day, the dependency on food
[00:39:51.668 --> 00:39:52.309]  I don't know.
[00:40:12.301 --> 00:40:30.114]  The best shot we can at getting the most food into as many family homes as possible, and looking at the financial structure that we've got in the economy right now, this last one is probably the best we've ever done, Alex, but because it's absolutely needed.
[00:40:30.114 --> 00:40:36.939]  What we've done is we've taken the 12-month food supply and broken it down so that you can get it in six-month supplies, but if you buy two of them,
[00:40:37.772 --> 00:40:44.637]  Uh, the shipping is free and you also save $260 in addition to the savings on the shipping cost.
[00:41:07.732 --> 00:41:08.853]  This is new food.
[00:41:08.853 --> 00:41:10.013]  It's high quality.
[00:41:10.013 --> 00:41:11.293]  You know you can trust it.
[00:41:11.293 --> 00:41:13.794]  This is where I get my storable food.
[00:41:13.794 --> 00:41:15.395]  It's a great price.
[00:41:15.395 --> 00:41:19.957]  They're great sponsors of the Freedom Movement for decades.
[00:41:19.957 --> 00:41:24.859]  The J. Michael Stevens Group, efoodsdirect.com, Steve Schenk, the owner, is with us.
[00:41:24.859 --> 00:41:25.259]  I hope
[00:41:25.859 --> 00:41:27.800]  You take advantage of this, and I'm gonna be honest with you.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:31.721]  I've got family, you know, who is struggling over the years.
[00:41:31.721 --> 00:41:38.563]  I've bought them year's supplies of food, you know, because that's where I invest is in my family.
[00:41:38.563 --> 00:41:39.863]  Or whether it's a month's supply.
[00:41:39.863 --> 00:41:43.104]  They've got a lot of other six-month specials, you name it.
[00:41:43.104 --> 00:41:50.226]  But again, Steve, give folks the specific special you're offering for the holidays and how long you're gonna be offering it.
[00:41:50.953 --> 00:41:52.494]  This is a six-month supply.
[00:41:52.494 --> 00:41:55.657]  We've also got two other supplies that they can look up on the internet.
[00:41:55.657 --> 00:42:00.520]  By the way, on the internet, it's efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:03.483]  efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:42:03.483 --> 00:42:06.805]  For those of you that aren't all that computer savvy, get on 800-409-5633.
[00:42:06.805 --> 00:42:07.025]  800-409-5633.
[00:42:07.025 --> 00:42:09.567]  And if you put together two of these specials,
[00:42:18.684 --> 00:42:28.527]  Uh, the shipping is absolutely free, but on each one of them, you've got $260 savings, which is just absolutely remarkable.
[00:42:28.527 --> 00:42:47.754]  So, uh, very simply, what we've done, Alex, is try and get the very most of the very best food out for the very least, so the people, uh, a lot of folks, we did a, we did a special during, uh, the Black Friday thing, and we were absolutely amazed at the number of people that are saying, heck with this thing.
[00:42:48.516 --> 00:42:55.482]  We're putting our Christmas money into something that can really mean something for us in the coming months.
[00:42:55.482 --> 00:43:13.298]  You know, I was out in my garage this morning and looking at my storable food, the attic's full of food, I've got a three-year supply for my whole family, and then I went in and checked my guns, in the gun safe, and even did a little oiling this morning, and I only do that a few times a year, but the point is,
[00:43:13.979 --> 00:43:19.163]  Just my instinct told me go look at your food, go look at your guns, and it's not that I live in fear.
[00:43:19.163 --> 00:43:22.445]  I'm like the ant who prepares for the winter, not the grasshopper.
[00:43:22.445 --> 00:43:30.532]  It's that as a man and as a steward of my family and my community, I need to be prepared and not be dependent on others.
[00:43:30.532 --> 00:43:32.233]  That is the first thing I'm to do.
[00:43:32.233 --> 00:43:33.474]  The Bible says that.
[00:43:33.954 --> 00:43:39.717]  And anybody who's got half a brain knows you need God, guns, guts, food.
[00:43:39.717 --> 00:43:42.478]  You know, your bullets, your beans, your Bibles.
[00:43:42.478 --> 00:43:44.279]  It's very, very simple.
[00:43:44.279 --> 00:43:47.341]  And this food lasts more than ten years in climate control.
[00:43:47.341 --> 00:43:48.602]  Ten years.
[00:43:48.602 --> 00:43:50.583]  And, you know, I do things like
[00:43:51.599 --> 00:43:58.448]  After I've got food that's getting to be six, seven years old, I give it to the food bank, or I start eating it, or I take it to the deer camp.
[00:43:58.448 --> 00:44:04.015]  A lot of this food is really tasty and good, even from companies years ago I got it from before I knew about eFoodsDirect.
[00:44:04.015 --> 00:44:10.243]  But the last three waves, and the last four years I bought from the J. Michael Stevens Group, eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:44:10.563 --> 00:44:11.964]  Because they've got the highest quality.
[00:44:11.964 --> 00:44:18.527]  Some of the other companies, you'll see MSG, or it'll have fillers, or it's from China, or whatever.
[00:44:18.527 --> 00:44:21.488]  The government MREs, not trustworthy.
[00:44:21.488 --> 00:44:24.249]  There's some good companies out there that produce them.
[00:44:24.249 --> 00:44:26.891]  But when you go to efoodsdirect.com, you know it's high quality.
[00:44:26.891 --> 00:44:30.472]  Briefly, tell folks about, you've got a wide spectrum of food.
[00:44:30.472 --> 00:44:33.073]  Gourmet, pre-packaged, the raw foods.
[00:44:33.073 --> 00:44:36.155]  You've got a bunch of different things you offer.
[00:44:36.155 --> 00:44:38.356]  Well, basically the whole idea is that
[00:44:38.866 --> 00:44:46.754]  If people are going to bet their lives on what they put into their food savings account, they've got to have everything.
[00:44:46.754 --> 00:44:51.199]  You've got the bulk items, the dehydrated foods that are the mainstays.
[00:44:51.199 --> 00:44:55.203]  You've got the Nutraversal soups and chilis and breads that have the vitamins in them.
[00:44:56.547 --> 00:44:57.867]  Yep, absolutely.
[00:44:57.867 --> 00:44:59.768]  And they're prepared.
[00:44:59.768 --> 00:45:03.369]  Most of the prepared items are so easy.
[00:45:03.369 --> 00:45:09.231]  The design was based on the fact that a 10-year-old can prepare every one of those prepared meals.
[00:45:09.231 --> 00:45:13.572]  And so the fact is that you will not find better tasting food.
[00:45:13.572 --> 00:45:21.394]  And what's happening is that people are able to save it, and they can use it.
[00:45:21.394 --> 00:45:24.095]  A lot of people right now, with the economy the way it is,
[00:45:24.642 --> 00:45:30.687]  We've got hundreds, virtually thousands of people that are using this food on a regular basis to supplement their budget.
[00:45:30.687 --> 00:45:38.412]  Well yeah, you warned them years ago, buy the food before the dollar devalues more, then you have that saving later because this is really tasty food.
[00:45:38.412 --> 00:45:42.295]  eFoodsDirect, the letter E, foodsdirect.com, give them the toll free number.
[00:45:42.295 --> 00:45:43.296]  800-409-5633.
[00:45:43.296 --> 00:45:43.496]  That's 800-409-5633.
[00:45:51.867 --> 00:45:58.934]  Well, Steve, I can't think of more important work than what you're doing and your support of this broadcast as well.
[00:45:58.934 --> 00:46:04.541]  You are the place to get food that people can really trust and depend on.
[00:46:05.942 --> 00:46:18.029]  Tell people that in the Great Depression, major universities have estimated, over the 10 years, 7 million people died from illnesses related to malnutrition and starvation.
[00:46:18.029 --> 00:46:25.533]  That's with about 89 to 90 percent, depending on the study, of people being agrarian or living on the farm or near a farm.
[00:46:25.533 --> 00:46:28.015]  Now we're right at 90 percent urban.
[00:46:28.015 --> 00:46:31.337]  Only half of the 10 percent that live on farms are self-sufficient.
[00:46:31.937 --> 00:46:33.918]  Okay, it's a six month supply that we've put together.
[00:46:56.195 --> 00:47:03.297]  And if they put two of them together, it's free shipping, but there's a total savings of $260 right out of the chute on that.
[00:47:03.297 --> 00:47:05.158]  And as far as the call, 800-409-5633.
[00:47:05.158 --> 00:47:11.780]  And on the net, efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:13.321]  Alex, I sure appreciate your help.
[00:47:13.632 --> 00:47:17.036]  Well, Steve, we sure appreciate you coming on the broadcast with us.
[00:47:17.036 --> 00:47:18.398]  God bless you.
[00:47:18.398 --> 00:47:21.001]  There goes Steve Schenck of efoodsdirect.com.
[00:47:21.001 --> 00:47:23.524]  I wouldn't procrastinate if I was you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:23.524 --> 00:47:25.767]  And if you ended up not needing this food, you can eat your investment.
[00:47:25.767 --> 00:47:29.571]  It's insurance you can eat, but the way this world's going, it's important to be self-sufficient.
[00:47:31.333 --> 00:47:42.039]  I want to, for the next 30 minutes or so, talk to John Young, the editor and one of the key founders of Cryptome.org.
[00:47:42.039 --> 00:47:43.360]  It's been around since 1996 by independent scholars.
[00:47:46.621 --> 00:47:49.923]  And the architect John Young and others.
[00:47:49.923 --> 00:47:57.587]  And the New York Observer had an article that quoted myself, the original WikiLeaker.
[00:47:57.587 --> 00:47:59.928]  And it's got my quote in here.
[00:47:59.928 --> 00:48:01.709]  And I think it says it all.
[00:48:01.709 --> 00:48:06.992]  That his work is very important, said Alex Jones, the radio host and founder of InfoWars.com.
[00:48:06.992 --> 00:48:15.136]  I don't really know of anybody who was posting secret, classified and restricted, but also open source documents to a site and creating a library.
[00:48:15.376 --> 00:48:16.616]  And they cut my quote off there.
[00:48:16.616 --> 00:48:20.177]  I went on to say, before Crypto.
[00:48:20.177 --> 00:48:24.038]  You have to say that he is the granddaddy of the WikiLeaks type phenomenon.
[00:48:24.038 --> 00:48:31.060]  And he also knows some of the WikiLeakers and has had a critical view of Assange in the past.
[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:38.563]  But now with all of this unfolding, we'll get John Young's breakdown on what he thinks is going on here.
[00:48:38.563 --> 00:48:39.603]  John, thanks for joining us.
[00:48:41.718 --> 00:48:43.888]  Good to have you here with us.
[00:48:43.888 --> 00:48:46.139]  We're going to break in a moment, but...
[00:48:47.475 --> 00:48:55.838]  I have always stated that I believe Assange was being set up as a unwitting or perhaps witting asset of the CIA, like a Lee Harvey Oswald.
[00:48:55.838 --> 00:49:03.020]  We know there's the George Soros, Leslie Gelb, all of those connections there.
[00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:07.041]  And Wayne Madsen has agreed with you that it's suspicious, so has Webster Tarpley.
[00:49:07.041 --> 00:49:16.484]  Now it appears that they're going to use this as an electronic 9-11 and they're announcing to come in and start shutting down web freedom on the internet.
[00:49:20.183 --> 00:49:25.006]  Yeah, that's a kind of talk they're making now.
[00:49:25.006 --> 00:49:30.929]  I think they'd like to keep this going about another 10 years so they can keep asking for more money for it.
[00:49:30.929 --> 00:49:42.495]  So I think they'll keep making these rumbling noises and hope that WikiLeaks or others like it will continue doing this thing because it's a tremendous way to raise funds for governments.
[00:49:42.495 --> 00:49:47.498]  Again, they get to build their giant cyber security spying grids in the name of countering their own leakers.
[00:49:49.232 --> 00:49:51.493]  Amazing.
[00:49:51.493 --> 00:50:04.361]  Well, I mean, when we look at this, these women that set him up, one of them is absolutely, you know, in Cuba running CIA ops.
[00:50:04.361 --> 00:50:07.102]  I mean, this is really... What do you think of Assange?
[00:50:07.102 --> 00:50:09.304]  Do you agree they're setting him up as the fall guy?
[00:50:11.544 --> 00:50:12.564]  It's possible.
[00:50:12.564 --> 00:50:16.845]  Often people are fed up with their not being completely reading about it.
[00:50:16.845 --> 00:50:19.126]  And it's not hard to do.
[00:50:19.126 --> 00:50:26.648]  Because there's a constant drumbeat of, we need to challenge authority, we need to challenge the CIA, we need to do this and that.
[00:50:26.648 --> 00:50:35.050]  And so this is a fairly well-known way to get some traction for a website or an initiative and to raise some money through it.
[00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:39.791]  And so the allegation of having sexual affairs is usually a component of that.
[00:50:41.015 --> 00:50:42.837]  Well, they claim that about Daniel Ellsberg.
[00:50:42.837 --> 00:50:43.478]  Stay there.
[00:50:43.478 --> 00:50:44.579]  Segment coming up.
[00:50:44.579 --> 00:50:58.776]  We'll continue to get into your overall view of the history of WikiLeaks, who's behind it, what's really happening with Julian Assange, these massive hack attacks against Sweden and MasterCard and Visa.
[00:51:01.178 --> 00:51:05.862]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:00.592 --> 00:52:05.556]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:05.556 --> 00:52:06.557]  What have we got?
[00:52:06.557 --> 00:52:08.999]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:08.999 --> 00:52:10.000]  A republic.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.662]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:12.662 --> 00:52:14.924]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:14.924 --> 00:52:16.946]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:16.946 --> 00:52:18.627]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:18.627 --> 00:52:19.949]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:19.949 --> 00:52:20.569]  Children?
[00:52:20.569 --> 00:52:21.690]  Our education?
[00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:22.491]  Our money?
[00:52:22.491 --> 00:52:26.174]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:26.514 --> 00:52:30.219]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:30.219 --> 00:52:31.481]  You are being warned.
[00:52:31.481 --> 00:52:32.502]  We have the facts.
[00:52:32.502 --> 00:52:33.683]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:33.683 --> 00:52:34.585]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:34.585 --> 00:52:35.466]  We have common law.
[00:52:35.466 --> 00:52:37.989]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:37.989 --> 00:52:41.774]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:52:41.874 --> 00:52:46.815]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:52:46.815 --> 00:52:48.336]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:52:48.336 --> 00:52:49.416]  Don't tread on me.
[00:52:49.416 --> 00:52:55.858]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:53:00.546 --> 00:53:05.749]  How well and how fast does heart and body extract work to improve blood circulation?
[00:53:05.749 --> 00:53:06.450]  Listen.
[00:53:06.450 --> 00:53:10.733]  My name is Ellis and I am 66 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[00:53:10.733 --> 00:53:14.115]  Two years ago, I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[00:53:14.115 --> 00:53:17.177]  I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[00:53:17.177 --> 00:53:20.539]  They wanted me to go on Plavix, but I refused knowing the negative side effects.
[00:53:20.939 --> 00:53:29.364]  Heart and body extract is a unique balance, synergy and proportion of herbs reaching from head to toe at maximum absorption around 95% at the cellular level.
[00:53:29.364 --> 00:53:31.925]  Within the first month I felt a dramatic difference.
[00:53:31.925 --> 00:53:36.268]  The heaviness in my legs was reduced and within two months I felt completely normal.
[00:53:36.513 --> 00:53:40.716]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[00:53:40.716 --> 00:53:44.919]  Heart and Body Extract comes with a 100% ironclad money back guarantee.

[00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:14.991]  John Young of Cryptome.org is our guest.
[00:54:14.991 --> 00:54:22.355]  He knows a lot about at least the founding and Wikileaks and some of the people involved.
[00:54:22.355 --> 00:54:31.639]  But it's on record that Cass Sunstein, who said that they would basically sabotage the web by posing as freedom fighters and leakers,
[00:54:32.279 --> 00:54:38.163]  Really introduced WikiLeaks to the world in 2007 in an editorial in the Washington Post that he wrote.
[00:54:38.163 --> 00:54:48.351]  So it's pretty much admitted this is a CIA group, as Mr. Young said on this show over a year ago, and predicted much of what's now unfolded.
[00:54:48.351 --> 00:54:54.836]  If you're going to have a trillion dollar war in Afghanistan or Iraq, you've got to go stage some terror attacks, fund the opposition.
[00:54:54.836 --> 00:54:59.919]  If you're going to have an excuse to take over the web and spy on everybody, you've got to finance some leaks.
[00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:04.642]  And you see the media, the way they supported it, the way they always hype it up.
[00:55:04.642 --> 00:55:10.966]  But I think, again, Assange is a useful dupe that they're flushing down the toilet, but time will tell.
[00:55:10.966 --> 00:55:25.514]  I mean, specifically, John, walk through what you believe is happening here, the founding of WikiLeaks, where you think this is going.
[00:55:25.514 --> 00:55:28.196]  John, give us your view on the statements I just made.
[00:55:32.076 --> 00:55:33.556]  He must have lost our audio.
[00:55:33.556 --> 00:55:35.657]  I can hear him typing.
[00:55:35.657 --> 00:55:38.878]  That happens with phones sometimes.
[00:55:38.878 --> 00:55:46.700]  John Young, can you hear me?
[00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:48.940]  We'll call him back.
[00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:50.701]  Okay, John.
[00:55:50.701 --> 00:55:55.222]  Go through your original concerns about WikiLeaks.
[00:55:55.222 --> 00:55:57.123]  Well, as you know, Alex, I was
[00:55:59.202 --> 00:56:05.904]  Sucker punched into serving as a public face at WikiLeaks because he didn't want any of them to be named in the registration of the website.
[00:56:05.904 --> 00:56:08.504]  So I did it because I've done it for others.
[00:56:08.504 --> 00:56:11.665]  And I was led to believe that it was a public benefit operation.
[00:56:11.665 --> 00:56:16.226]  But within a few weeks, it announced that it intended to raise $5 million in the first six months.
[00:56:16.226 --> 00:56:18.366]  I said, wait a minute.
[00:56:18.366 --> 00:56:20.147]  That doesn't sound like public benefit to me.
[00:56:20.147 --> 00:56:20.767]  That sounds like a
[00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:27.152]  A high-value funded program.
[00:56:27.152 --> 00:56:30.094]  And I mentioned two examples, CIA and Soros.
[00:56:30.094 --> 00:56:31.234]  I didn't accuse them of that.
[00:56:31.234 --> 00:56:34.376]  I said it would be like that, in which deep pockets are funding something.
[00:56:34.376 --> 00:56:39.278]  You can't just raise money by a non-governmental organization in that brief period of time.
[00:56:39.278 --> 00:56:42.220]  Now, we know that businesses do that, though, with the same kind of rollout.
[00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:48.443]  And so that was my first sense that this was a business operation, not a public benefit operation.
[00:56:48.443 --> 00:56:49.403]  And it turned out to be that.
[00:56:52.192 --> 00:56:57.157]  Uh, and, um, others may make the link to CIA and Soros.
[00:56:57.157 --> 00:57:02.401]  Uh, by the way, both of whom use the same techniques of claiming to be public benefit.
[00:57:02.401 --> 00:57:06.084]  But Farben being the only one, churches do it, educationalists do it, and so forth.
[00:57:06.084 --> 00:57:11.349]  So that public benefit is a well-known subterfuge for actually making pretty good money these days.
[00:57:11.349 --> 00:57:13.731]  Of course, following the government model.
[00:57:16.283 --> 00:57:18.984]  Okay, now, so, I mean, that's important, Ted Bitt.
[00:57:18.984 --> 00:57:23.486]  You registered, and that's been confirmed, the WikiLeaks URL to begin with.
[00:57:23.486 --> 00:57:24.647]  When was that, John?
[00:57:24.647 --> 00:57:27.448]  That was in December 2007.
[00:57:27.448 --> 00:57:31.829]  And have you seen the fact that it was Cass Sunstein that basically introduced them to the world?
[00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:35.451]  Say that again, Alex.
[00:57:35.451 --> 00:57:41.474]  It was Cass Sunstein who introduced WikiLeaks to the world in that Washington Post article he wrote in 2007.
[00:57:44.997 --> 00:57:51.680]  And this is a guy who openly says that he would pose as activist on the web as a pretext to bring censorship in.
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:54.061]  Now they're introducing the legislation to do just that.
[00:57:54.061 --> 00:57:55.442]  I mean, this is pretty obvious.
[00:57:56.687 --> 00:58:11.238]  Well, it's certainly a complicated story and needs to be watched very carefully because I think there's a lot of smoke being blown about this and that a lot of the usual excultation and accusation is being rolled out as part of that smoke blowing on all parties' sides.
[00:58:11.238 --> 00:58:16.462]  Some of the enthusiasts for WikiLeaks seem to be operating in concert with some of its opponents.
[00:58:16.462 --> 00:58:18.204]  It looks like they're in lockstep to me.
[00:58:19.028 --> 00:58:19.308]  Really?
[00:58:19.308 --> 00:58:20.028]  Okay, stay there.
[00:58:20.028 --> 00:58:21.989]  We're back in one minute, John.
[00:58:21.989 --> 00:58:22.549]  One minute break.
[00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:25.950]  I want to try to give you the floor so that I'm not just asking the questions.
[00:58:25.950 --> 00:58:38.215]  I want to give you the floor to break down what you think's going on and to cut through this fog of war, this fog of info war, and give us a clear image of what you, a true insider, thinks.
[00:58:38.215 --> 00:58:42.096]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:42.096 --> 00:58:45.517]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:50.589 --> 00:58:52.250]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[00:59:48.876 --> 00:59:53.498]  Thank you.
[00:59:53.498 --> 00:59:55.860]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:58.661]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.267 --> 01:00:10.109]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.109 --> 01:00:11.690]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:13.230]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:17.432]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.432 --> 01:00:21.494]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.734 --> 01:00:32.242]  Well, this whole Wikileaks situation is very complex, but bottom line, it's the pretext to bring in censorship control of the web.
[01:00:32.242 --> 01:00:37.726]  The whole cyber security system being built up, and John Young of Cryptome.org predicted this.
[01:00:37.726 --> 01:00:40.689]  He's, again, the original Wikileaker.
[01:00:40.689 --> 01:00:46.234]  He's the guy that set up the website originally for them, but then he pulled out very quickly.
[01:00:46.914 --> 01:00:49.995]  Now he said years ago, looks like a Soros type operation.
[01:00:49.995 --> 01:00:54.157]  Now we have clear connections to that, that's even mainstream media.
[01:00:54.157 --> 01:00:58.098]  Now I want to, this is a short segment, long segment coming up John, but I want to give you the floor.
[01:00:58.098 --> 01:01:00.399]  You talk about this, you know, this being foggy.
[01:01:00.399 --> 01:01:01.139]  Bring clarity.
[01:01:01.139 --> 01:01:07.442]  I mean as somebody who probably knows more about this than anybody else, in the next four minutes, you've got the floor.
[01:01:07.442 --> 01:01:09.142]  What do you want to say to folks about this?
[01:01:09.142 --> 01:01:10.283]  What do you think is most important?
[01:01:12.045 --> 01:01:14.586]  Addiction is, of course, a cliché, but true here.
[01:01:14.586 --> 01:01:19.447]  For two and a half years, Wikileaks was on the verge of bankruptcy.
[01:01:19.447 --> 01:01:25.048]  They shut down for a few months and came back with bombshells, and suddenly in the morning, the money started pouring in.
[01:01:25.048 --> 01:01:33.650]  This is a well-known business model to hand out free cigarettes and then sell them after you get the addiction started.
[01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:37.151]  And so it's also a well-known government technique to create a crisis.
[01:01:39.269 --> 01:01:39.609]  I think so.
[01:02:02.049 --> 01:02:05.251]  I'm down on anti-war people as well as pro-war people because they seem to be working hand-in-hand.
[01:02:26.551 --> 01:02:33.934]  So I think that's a lesson we've learned running our site, that there are all sorts of threats imputed to Crypto.
[01:02:33.934 --> 01:02:35.215]  None of that has come to pass.
[01:02:35.215 --> 01:02:39.457]  It was just a shell game to make it seem like it was a threat, but there wasn't.
[01:02:39.457 --> 01:02:43.698]  We've never been shot at except by one time by Microsoft, which then withdrew it.
[01:02:45.639 --> 01:02:49.523]  WikiLeaks was shut down once by a court, but then that was withdrawn.
[01:02:49.523 --> 01:02:52.805]  As far as I know, no officials have ever approached WikiLeaks with a threat.
[01:02:52.805 --> 01:02:55.067]  Now, maybe they have and they've kept it quiet.
[01:02:55.067 --> 01:03:01.593]  We always publicize when we're approached by officials to let them know that this is something of a show game.
[01:03:01.593 --> 01:03:11.361]  So we'd like to see more attention paid to how often this occurs, not by WikiLeaks, but by others who are rushing to their support, but also rushing to oppose them.
[01:03:11.361 --> 01:03:12.462]  There's money to be made in this.
[01:03:13.496 --> 01:03:14.337]  I'm talking about the media.
[01:03:14.337 --> 01:03:19.502]  I'm talking about the so-called outlaws, the so-called dissidents.
[01:03:19.502 --> 01:03:21.003]  This is a big-time operation.
[01:03:21.003 --> 01:03:22.084]  Everyone's getting in on this.
[01:03:22.084 --> 01:03:24.446]  So I'm admiring this taking place.
[01:03:24.446 --> 01:03:26.788]  It'll be kept going for quite a while.
[01:03:26.788 --> 01:03:30.912]  Money's pouring in from all sides, to both sides of the fight.
[01:03:30.912 --> 01:03:32.513]  And so this use of the word cyber war,
[01:03:33.594 --> 01:03:37.456]  Yeah, when I talk about info war, I mean getting people talking, saying no to tyranny.
[01:03:37.456 --> 01:03:40.818]  Their info war, they're talking about hacking and more the Pentagon version of that.
[01:03:58.442 --> 01:04:01.825]  And so that's what Cybercom is now doing.
[01:04:01.825 --> 01:04:06.609]  They're going to milk cyber threats as much as they can over the next several years.
[01:04:06.609 --> 01:04:17.319]  And that's why I think that the Bradley Manning thing was a steam that, you know, they teach at Fort Huachuca, Alex, how people like Bradley Manning can do this and set up these steam operations.
[01:04:17.319 --> 01:04:19.661]  And so he was trained there.
[01:04:19.661 --> 01:04:23.424]  And so it smells like that to me.
[01:04:24.477 --> 01:04:33.244]  And there'll be more coming, though, because right now they're just testing the public's reaction with this low-level secrecy revelation, but the other stuff will come.
[01:04:33.244 --> 01:04:34.205]  All right, stay there.
[01:04:34.205 --> 01:04:36.027]  We're going to come back in three minutes, John.
[01:04:36.027 --> 01:04:37.308]  Long segment.
[01:04:37.308 --> 01:04:40.951]  And I want to continue to drill down into WikiLeaks.
[01:04:40.951 --> 01:04:45.895]  I mean, obviously you've got all these Soros-CIA connections, Cass Sunstein.
[01:04:45.895 --> 01:04:49.037]  Sunstein writing two years ago, two and a half years ago, that
[01:04:49.881 --> 01:04:56.718]  They would infiltrate the web, pose as activists, create crisis, then bring in censorship legislation.
[01:04:56.718 --> 01:04:57.681]  That's now happening.
[01:04:57.681 --> 01:04:58.342]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:00.703 --> 01:05:04.806]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[01:06:59.898 --> 01:07:03.739]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:07:03.739 --> 01:07:08.020]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:12.900]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:18.641]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:07:18.641 --> 01:07:22.302]  Not worried about them moving south.
[01:07:22.302 --> 01:07:25.603]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:07:28.454 --> 01:07:32.217]  I'm looking for America.
[01:07:32.217 --> 01:07:35.099]  Wear American and be proud.
[01:07:35.099 --> 01:07:38.341]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:07:38.341 --> 01:07:42.724]  Land I left free in the home of the brave.
[01:07:42.724 --> 01:07:46.486]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:07:54.409 --> 01:08:01.716]  And you, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:08:01.716 --> 01:08:03.857]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.857 --> 01:08:07.200]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:20.442 --> 01:08:24.546]  John Young of Cryptone.org, the original Wikileaker.
[01:08:24.546 --> 01:08:27.448]  That's the New York Observer headline.
[01:08:27.448 --> 01:08:33.313]  He set up the site for them originally, but then immediately got suspicious of it.
[01:08:35.263 --> 01:08:36.844]  And this is the pretext.
[01:08:36.844 --> 01:08:48.993]  Just like they set up Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, they're now setting this up, and now they've got thousands of hackers attacking MasterCard, Visa, Sarah Palin for calling Assange un-American.
[01:08:48.993 --> 01:08:52.115]  You know, I don't want to hate Sarah Palin, but give me a break.
[01:08:52.115 --> 01:08:57.899]  She said that the South shouldn't have attacked North Korea, and that we've got to stand with North Korea.
[01:08:57.899 --> 01:09:00.280]  She doesn't know that North Korea is the Stalinist state.
[01:09:01.661 --> 01:09:05.202]  She's now come out and said that Assange is un-American.
[01:09:05.202 --> 01:09:08.664]  Assange is Australian, honey.
[01:09:08.664 --> 01:09:13.505]  But this is just getting crazier and crazier by the minute.
[01:09:13.505 --> 01:09:20.368]  And now they've released cables dealing with DynCorp running little kidnapped boys.
[01:09:21.479 --> 01:09:26.364]  Which you see in the news all the time, but there is some pretty bombshell stuff in here.
[01:09:26.364 --> 01:09:31.929]  But could that be that the mainstream media is going through this and only covering what they want to go over?
[01:09:31.929 --> 01:09:41.679]  Because so much of what I've read, and I've tried to go through a lot of it, and so much of what the media has picked up on, really reinforces the whole war on terror propaganda.
[01:09:41.679 --> 01:09:46.583]  And anybody who knows the basics understands just because some document's secret doesn't mean it's true.
[01:09:47.518 --> 01:09:52.482]  I mean, they have the Office of Special Plans saying they knew where the WMDs were and that was secret.
[01:09:52.482 --> 01:09:59.027]  So some of the biggest propaganda you see is inside government because it's an echo chamber of brainwashing.
[01:09:59.027 --> 01:10:02.369]  John Young of Cryptome.org, what's your view on what I just said?
[01:10:02.369 --> 01:10:08.994]  Well, all classification is used to exaggerate the importance of information.
[01:10:08.994 --> 01:10:12.597]  And so you shouldn't believe something because it's secret, top secret, whatever these are.
[01:10:12.597 --> 01:10:14.058]  These are glamorizing terms.
[01:10:15.111 --> 01:10:22.919]  Uh, and so that, uh, and by the way, people inside you could keep, you know this, and that's why they, the stuff leaks out.
[01:10:22.919 --> 01:10:26.683]  Uh, is, is the really important information is not classified.
[01:10:26.683 --> 01:10:29.205]  In fact, you can't even, you can't even know it exists.
[01:10:29.205 --> 01:10:33.830]  So these known classifications are, are subterfuges to make it seem it's important stuff.
[01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:37.354]  Secondly, these cables, these cables look like they were written from reading the press.
[01:10:38.377 --> 01:10:40.038]  Rather than either way around.
[01:10:40.038 --> 01:10:46.921]  And as we know, that's a common way that embassies gather information, is read the press and quote it as their own views.
[01:10:46.921 --> 01:10:51.823]  Yeah, they've got to file reports, so they sit there with a Word document open, cutting clips out.
[01:10:51.823 --> 01:10:57.606]  In fact, that's already been pointed out, that a lot of this stuff was excised right out of newspapers and not even changed.
[01:10:57.606 --> 01:11:01.127]  So, it's a bunch of neocon propaganda.
[01:11:01.127 --> 01:11:06.930]  That's right, but that's what the media, sorry to say, that's what most of the media does for a living.
[01:11:08.419 --> 01:11:08.979]  We're good to go.
[01:11:23.015 --> 01:11:33.962]  Well look, they get a government press release and they put that in the article and then the embassy takes the article that's a boiled down government press release and then puts it out as secret.
[01:11:33.962 --> 01:11:39.566]  That's like a few months ago they made all the TSA workers top secret or secret clearances.
[01:11:39.566 --> 01:11:42.448]  That way they can't protect themselves with a union.
[01:11:42.448 --> 01:11:45.330]  That way they can be lied to about the tariff threat.
[01:11:45.330 --> 01:11:48.352]  That way they can feel like they're old James Bonds.
[01:11:48.352 --> 01:11:52.995]  It's kind of like giving somebody the newspaper associate editor title in lieu of
[01:11:53.435 --> 01:11:56.597]  You hit it right on the head.
[01:11:56.597 --> 01:12:02.079]  These are often ways to boost morale within an organization is to declare something secret and let you in on it.
[01:12:02.079 --> 01:12:04.780]  By the way, they do this to presidents too.
[01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:06.641]  They read them into the secrecy world and
[01:12:10.131 --> 01:12:11.352]  Shall I go on with this?
[01:12:11.352 --> 01:12:12.232]  Yeah, continue.
[01:12:12.232 --> 01:12:20.356]  Yeah, is that, you know, we have all these people outside government saying, we gotta do this, we gotta do that, and then they go inside and suddenly they don't say that anymore.
[01:12:20.356 --> 01:12:27.719]  It's usually because they've been read into the secrecy pearl where they're under lifetime threat to never disclose it, and they suddenly shut up.
[01:12:27.719 --> 01:12:30.260]  It's a one-way street, and you can never back out once you're in.
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:31.681]  That's why there are no ex-spies.
[01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:34.302]  Every spy has lifelong secrecy built into their blood.
[01:12:35.370 --> 01:12:41.574]  And that's why some of them are out there bullshitting about what they're revealing, because they're under a lifetime constraint, and it's a serious constraint.
[01:12:41.574 --> 01:12:46.217]  But mainly is that it's a good way to make a living.
[01:12:46.217 --> 01:12:48.379]  Being inside the secrecy world is an awfully good thing.
[01:12:48.379 --> 01:12:52.121]  Of course, it started when the first church was set up, or the first kingdom was set up.
[01:12:52.121 --> 01:12:53.722]  So it's been around for a while, Alex.
[01:12:53.722 --> 01:12:57.385]  It's secrecy is a narcotic against them.
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:03.805]  Well I have to agree with you on this because overall it allows the dominant media that's being supplanted by alternative media to
[01:13:22.318 --> 01:13:40.215]  Demonize the internet to begin to grow the surveillance grid towards the original incremental Shutdown of the web all of this happens the web as we know it all of this happens with the backdrop of the FCC Commissioner saying Freedom of speech is an aberration in the media.
[01:13:40.215 --> 01:13:43.479]  We're gonna shut it down government approved all of this comes out
[01:13:44.497 --> 01:13:44.697]  We're good
[01:14:03.414 --> 01:14:16.506]  But I think like Lee Harvey Oswald there's a good chance they're again setting him up or this could be all part of a big pageant kind of like Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers where they tried to prosecute him but then the case fell apart to give him street cred.
[01:14:16.506 --> 01:14:23.853]  We know the naval intelligence operative Woodward was with Deep Throat, Alexander Haig and Kissinger.
[01:14:23.853 --> 01:14:28.277]  Deep Throat we know is a composite to burn Kissinger, I mean to burn Nixon.
[01:14:30.058 --> 01:14:40.185]  So the whole way this is going it's very very clear, but then you've almost got to support Julian Assange because the charges against him are clearly false.
[01:14:40.185 --> 01:14:46.829]  I mean not wearing a condom and consensual sex by some feminist who writes articles about how to set men up in the legal system.
[01:14:46.829 --> 01:14:49.071]  You can't make that up and
[01:14:49.771 --> 01:15:04.481]  So you've got to support Assange because if they're able to nail him for no reason, then I can be arrested for the secret documents that I've put out that are real that they did not want people to get, like the MIAC and Homeland Security reports.
[01:15:04.481 --> 01:15:09.165]  I happen to know that one of the people that leaked me stuff, they found out about other things he was doing and he got
[01:15:09.805 --> 01:15:11.366]  In a lot of trouble.
[01:15:11.366 --> 01:15:15.488]  But I mean, this is all just incredible stuff that's going on.
[01:15:15.488 --> 01:15:18.950]  John, you just heard me rant about, you know, the point about Assange.
[01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:30.277]  I mean, if we don't support him in free speech, even though this is all basically a setup, then doesn't it set the precedent for them to come throw John Young or Alex Jones in the Huskow?
[01:15:32.193 --> 01:15:38.059]  Good point, because in fact someone said on the mail list, hey, why is John Young up in charge of rapes?
[01:15:38.059 --> 01:15:46.247]  And I had to laugh at that, because you see me compared to Assange, you know that charge would never stand up.
[01:15:46.247 --> 01:15:52.292]  But my point is that, don't be lulled by this rape charge in Sweden.
[01:15:52.292 --> 01:15:54.495]  There's more coming along that line.
[01:15:54.495 --> 01:15:56.757]  This is just a tip of what's coming out of Sweden.
[01:15:58.022 --> 01:16:03.207]  And so, don't forget, we're on a bombshell campaign, Alex, and every day something unexpected happens.
[01:16:03.207 --> 01:16:08.312]  So something in a series of unexpected things will happen on that strand while other things are happening on the strand.
[01:16:08.312 --> 01:16:11.034]  So this is a multi-stranded operation.
[01:16:11.034 --> 01:16:16.459]  And we're actually being teased with the easy stuff right now to set us up for more interesting stuff.
[01:16:17.611 --> 01:16:18.832]  Well, we've seen that pattern.
[01:16:18.832 --> 01:16:26.898]  It's building, building, as you said, and I gotta hand it to you, over a year ago, you laid it out with precision.
[01:16:26.898 --> 01:16:31.621]  Let's go back, though, because you've been an insider in this entire world.
[01:16:31.621 --> 01:16:38.346]  What are your WikiLeaks sources, or other hacker insiders, what are they telling you, John, that you can relay to us?
[01:16:38.346 --> 01:16:41.649]  What bombshells can you give us?
[01:16:41.649 --> 01:16:45.532]  Well, let me tell you who they are, and where you can find their names.
[01:16:45.532 --> 01:16:46.953]  You can find them on Wikipedia.
[01:16:48.095 --> 01:16:48.916]  That's a PKD term!
[01:16:56.258 --> 01:16:59.919]  Uh, Cypher spelled with a Y. C-Y-P-H-P-U-N-K.
[01:16:59.919 --> 01:17:00.899]  Cypherpunk, got it.
[01:17:00.899 --> 01:17:01.380]  I tried.
[01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:12.263]  Look there and scroll down to the bottom and you'll see my name, Sonja's name, several dozen names of people who all plotted all this and are still very active in this.
[01:17:12.263 --> 01:17:14.724]  And I'm sort of pointing to this now.
[01:17:14.724 --> 01:17:16.324]  Would you want to know what's behind WikiLeaks?
[01:17:16.324 --> 01:17:18.905]  Go to this one site and you'll see the entire gang.
[01:17:19.665 --> 01:17:28.607]  You'll see a whole bunch of links to other sources, and you'll see how long this has been going on, and why you're not going to be able to contain it.
[01:17:28.607 --> 01:17:36.549]  And so, that's the first thing I can tell you, is that this is public information that's been out there for years, but no one did the slightest amount of research on this.
[01:17:36.549 --> 01:17:45.731]  And so that beyond this Wikipedia entry, I've got the archives of the Cypherpunks mail list that went on for several years, where all these issues were thoroughly discussed.
[01:17:45.731 --> 01:17:47.752]  This is very high-level technical material.
[01:17:48.852 --> 01:17:51.835]  And these are not young people like Assange.
[01:17:51.835 --> 01:17:55.739]  Some of these people are extremely wealthy, and they're not George Soros, who's clueless, technically.
[01:17:55.739 --> 01:17:58.241]  And he thinks his visions makes him all-powerful, but it doesn't.
[01:17:58.241 --> 01:18:02.925]  It makes him rather stupid, like the CIA is stupid because of their alleged power.
[01:18:02.925 --> 01:18:09.031]  So these are people who are much crafter than that, but I would recommend that people take a look at the Saffron Punk's Wikipedia.
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:14.943]  Okay, I'm looking at the Cypher... John, I'm looking at the Cypherpunks on Wikipedia.
[01:18:14.943 --> 01:18:16.243]  Scroll up for me.
[01:18:16.243 --> 01:18:18.125]  Guys, scroll down to the bottom.
[01:18:18.125 --> 01:18:19.666]  Okay, but I want to make sure I've got the right entry.
[01:18:19.666 --> 01:18:21.487]  Go to the top for me real quick.
[01:18:21.487 --> 01:18:31.175]  It's the Cypherpunk entry on Wikipedia, and not to be confused with the PKD Cyberpunk.
[01:18:31.175 --> 01:18:32.796]  Okay, let's scroll to the bottom now.
[01:18:32.796 --> 01:18:33.636]  Go ahead.
[01:18:33.636 --> 01:18:34.717]  Go down to the bottom.
[01:18:34.717 --> 01:18:36.719]  You'll see there's a list.
[01:18:37.439 --> 01:18:38.320]  John Gilmore of Sun Microsystems.
[01:19:02.535 --> 01:19:08.999]  Extremely intelligent, highly capable engineers, scientists, cryptographers, highly political astute people.
[01:19:08.999 --> 01:19:13.881]  Assange came on board in 1995 and there were several thousand people on this list.
[01:19:13.881 --> 01:19:20.665]  It's an amazing... Okay, so it's a wide spectrum, but what's the overall political kernel to this?
[01:19:20.665 --> 01:19:26.969]  Is this truly independent or is this a government agency or is this a combine?
[01:19:26.969 --> 01:19:29.730]  Well, I'm gonna try to give you an answer that may be a little hard to understand.
[01:19:29.730 --> 01:19:30.451]  It is none of those.
[01:19:31.661 --> 01:19:34.582]  The intent was to have nothing that can be attacked easily.
[01:19:34.582 --> 01:19:36.083]  So it's not an organization.
[01:19:36.083 --> 01:19:37.883]  It's not an entity.
[01:19:37.883 --> 01:19:39.004]  It's a concept.
[01:19:39.004 --> 01:19:40.544]  It's a aspiration.
[01:19:40.544 --> 01:19:41.505]  It's a goal.
[01:19:41.505 --> 01:19:45.106]  It is not anything you're going to be able to take down by the usual means.
[01:19:45.106 --> 01:19:47.327]  That's the very purpose of it is to not make it.
[01:19:47.327 --> 01:19:49.588]  And that's why I say WikiLeaks will not be taken down.
[01:19:49.588 --> 01:19:50.668]  It'll pop up some other way.
[01:19:52.193 --> 01:19:59.094]  So you're saying it's almost like the internet is a bunch of computers connected to each other and can't be taken down.
[01:19:59.094 --> 01:20:08.736]  This is just basically hackers and computer experts that built a system that anybody in the group can pump info out and nobody can stop it.
[01:20:08.736 --> 01:20:14.757]  And that's why WikiLeaks people told the news yesterday, to take us down, you'll have to shut the web down.
[01:20:14.757 --> 01:20:17.437]  That's right.
[01:20:17.437 --> 01:20:19.038]  That's why it was set up.
[01:20:19.038 --> 01:20:21.398]  It was set up as a spying machine, I told you on your last show.
[01:20:22.359 --> 01:20:23.480]  I don't know.
[01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:43.131]  Well that's, I mean, that's what I've always said.
[01:20:43.131 --> 01:20:56.741]  They use Google to spy on us, we use Google to spy on them with the massive group collective brain that they're not ever going to be able to stop because they might even have the intelligence, but they don't have the personnel to deploy operations.
[01:20:56.741 --> 01:21:01.384]  But as long as we're an idea, a manifesto of human liberty, it's unstoppable.
[01:21:01.384 --> 01:21:03.085]  Yep, that's right.
[01:21:03.085 --> 01:21:08.789]  Because they'll have to stop themselves if they do, because they set this up in order to control things and they're gradually losing control.
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:14.765]  So it's kind of like the Lord of the Rings analogy of Sauron.
[01:21:14.765 --> 01:21:23.296]  He makes the ring, but the ring actually controls him so somebody can get the ring and throw it into the crack of doom.
[01:21:23.296 --> 01:21:25.860]  This is always the outcome of imperialism.
[01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:27.582]  It eventually destroys itself.
[01:21:29.838 --> 01:21:30.999]  Unbelievable.
[01:21:30.999 --> 01:21:43.544]  And again, you've had piercing understanding of this because you were involved from the start, and you're telling, I mean, you're talking just like government people I've talked to, like Dr. Bob Bowman, former head of Star Wars.
[01:21:43.544 --> 01:21:48.706]  He'll always say, well, I can give you what's open source, or they declassified this by mistake.
[01:21:48.706 --> 01:21:49.826]  I can tell you this.
[01:21:49.826 --> 01:21:51.767]  Now, go look at that.
[01:21:51.767 --> 01:21:54.088]  And so you're saying, look at this list.
[01:21:54.088 --> 01:21:55.869]  It's hidden in plain view.
[01:21:55.869 --> 01:21:58.070]  This is a system, a door that swings both ways.
[01:22:01.512 --> 01:22:05.996]  What I'm getting from what you're saying, John, is that this is out of control.
[01:22:05.996 --> 01:22:06.517]  Well, it is.
[01:22:06.517 --> 01:22:09.419]  However, you know, it's smart people all around.
[01:22:09.419 --> 01:22:15.325]  One of the things we always have to keep in mind is that every time you think you've got a clear understanding of someone else,
[01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:22.582]  And so one of the things that I admire about the Cypherpunks, they never got completely arrogant and said that we are going to run things.
[01:22:22.582 --> 01:22:26.463]  A few tried and they got shot down by critics who were smarter than they were.
[01:22:26.463 --> 01:22:29.404]  So what I'd like to caution is don't think that you're going to get this easily.
[01:22:29.404 --> 01:22:35.426]  To say it's out of control, I'm saying you're going to take some work because you'll be set up repeatedly and entrapped.
[01:22:35.426 --> 01:22:40.367]  And as with Wikileaks, now they've got Wikileaks redacting documents.
[01:22:40.367 --> 01:22:42.948]  So that means the fix is in.
[01:22:42.948 --> 01:22:44.449]  Because redaction is a control.
[01:22:47.148 --> 01:22:51.270]  Well, that shows that they're coming to him and saying, don't give out our agents' names.
[01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:52.810]  We'll go easier on you.
[01:22:52.810 --> 01:22:54.831]  They're already being co-opted.
[01:22:54.831 --> 01:22:56.652]  Yeah, because of the money.
[01:22:56.652 --> 01:22:58.752]  The money is fabulous.
[01:22:58.752 --> 01:23:01.333]  Because they were not making money being out there on their own.
[01:23:01.333 --> 01:23:04.395]  So now they've raised millions by being on the inside.
[01:23:04.395 --> 01:23:05.575]  So why not?
[01:23:05.575 --> 01:23:07.976]  Well, what is your inside scoop?
[01:23:07.976 --> 01:23:15.859]  If you were offered a billion dollar bribe, and you were 39 years old and had no other income, think about it.
[01:23:18.581 --> 01:23:22.263]  It's called a government contract.
[01:23:22.263 --> 01:23:26.746]  Well, what's your inside intel or your gut if you don't have the inside intel?
[01:23:26.746 --> 01:23:29.588]  Is this a big theater with Assange?
[01:23:29.588 --> 01:23:33.230]  Or are they burning him for the theater?
[01:23:33.230 --> 01:23:35.492]  It's a theater operation.
[01:23:35.492 --> 01:23:41.235]  Partly entertaining, partly lulling, partly testing systems.
[01:23:41.235 --> 01:23:42.456]  Testing public reaction.
[01:23:42.456 --> 01:23:45.118]  Are we going to get traction out of cyber threats or not?
[01:23:46.102 --> 01:23:46.883]  Will this work or not?
[01:23:46.883 --> 01:23:49.504]  Because so far, you know, they've not actually caused any harm.
[01:23:49.504 --> 01:23:50.585]  That's why they haven't been charged.
[01:23:50.585 --> 01:23:52.005]  Yeah, this is the beta testing.
[01:23:52.005 --> 01:23:53.826]  Now they're going to start releasing even more.
[01:23:53.826 --> 01:23:54.327]  That's right.
[01:23:54.327 --> 01:23:58.109]  And then there'll be some lives lost or something will happen.
[01:23:58.109 --> 01:24:02.951]  Because, don't forget, these are cheap operations to run.
[01:24:02.951 --> 01:24:09.455]  And so, somewhere, because this is still a fictional war, it's not a real war, it's a cyber war, which is all imaginary.
[01:24:09.455 --> 01:24:10.315]  Well, let me ask you this.
[01:24:10.315 --> 01:24:12.496]  And when it becomes really harmful, we'll see.
[01:24:12.496 --> 01:24:13.617]  Because the law will be ready.
[01:24:14.127 --> 01:24:18.428]  What is your idea, John Young from Cryptome.org, the original Wikileaker?
[01:24:18.428 --> 01:24:24.350]  What is your view, your idea, and I should have you back for a full hour soon, this is incredible.
[01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:28.912]  I want liberty, I want freedom, I want my private property, I don't want to be a slave.
[01:24:28.912 --> 01:24:30.312]  I would imagine that's your view.
[01:24:30.312 --> 01:24:35.334]  I don't want to be part of an empire, I don't want to support all these wars in my name.
[01:24:35.334 --> 01:24:36.394]  So that's my view.
[01:24:36.394 --> 01:24:41.656]  I know I'm a good guy, but I know in ways I've been used as well, because this is such a complex world,
[01:24:42.176 --> 01:24:43.077]  Well, it's what I was told as a kid.
[01:24:43.077 --> 01:24:44.778]  Trust no one but yourself and warn people not to trust you.
[01:24:44.778 --> 01:24:46.018]  We say on Krypton, do not trust us.
[01:25:11.425 --> 01:25:12.966]  Well, there was a WikiLeaker that did rat him out.
[01:25:36.135 --> 01:25:38.457]  Well, we actually don't know what happened.
[01:25:38.457 --> 01:25:42.740]  I'll just say, watching all this with considerable interest, it's still not clear what happened.
[01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:44.942]  All we have are various kinds of fairy tales in the media.
[01:25:44.942 --> 01:25:46.283]  We haven't seen much evidence.
[01:25:46.283 --> 01:25:50.046]  We've got a lot of talk of people who are well-known liars.
[01:25:50.046 --> 01:25:53.568]  And most hackers are liars, because that's how they social engineer.
[01:25:53.568 --> 01:25:55.150]  Most people on the internet lie.
[01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:57.531]  I lie.
[01:25:57.531 --> 01:25:58.192]  Are you hearing me?
[01:25:58.192 --> 01:25:58.832]  I lie.
[01:25:58.832 --> 01:26:01.034]  I'm lying to you right now.
[01:26:01.034 --> 01:26:02.435]  Keep that in mind.
[01:26:02.435 --> 01:26:03.356]  Everyone's got their agenda.
[01:26:04.417 --> 01:26:10.919]  Well, when you say you lie, what, you've put out little disinfo involving where you live or your name.
[01:26:10.919 --> 01:26:14.020]  I mean, you don't lie about the overall truth, sir.
[01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:20.163]  I mean, are you saying you lie as like you take the address numbers off your apartment door?
[01:26:20.163 --> 01:26:25.184]  No, I lie to ignorance, but I don't know any better, and will not admit it.
[01:26:25.184 --> 01:26:29.526]  I'll pretend that I've got access to truth by the tail, and I'm delivering it to you.
[01:26:30.729 --> 01:26:36.052]  And so the reason I'm lying is because I don't know how else to convey what I'm doing in an honest way.
[01:26:36.052 --> 01:26:37.953]  We need to work on that.
[01:26:37.953 --> 01:26:39.934]  Everyone exaggerates.
[01:26:39.934 --> 01:26:40.434]  You know what?
[01:26:40.434 --> 01:26:42.275]  No one is perfect.
[01:26:42.275 --> 01:26:49.278]  And I think the second guess, yourself, I mean, I'm not delivering pure truth, so I'm lying to you.
[01:26:49.278 --> 01:26:54.521]  I think it's if you consciously try to dead reckon as best you can, I think
[01:26:55.621 --> 01:27:05.008]  Veritas, the proof of Veritas is, on the balance, does 80 plus percent of what you talk about come true, or 90 percent?
[01:27:05.008 --> 01:27:08.510]  Or does, you know, everything you do turn out to be wrong?
[01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:11.512]  And I watch mainstream media, they're lying on purpose.
[01:27:11.512 --> 01:27:13.033]  We're here trying to tell the truth.
[01:27:13.033 --> 01:27:14.535]  We get some things wrong.
[01:27:14.535 --> 01:27:16.836]  But, I mean, I know there's good people, John.
[01:27:16.836 --> 01:27:24.842]  I mean, my whole issue is, I think part of getting into this whole world that you've been part of so long is that you're so in with all these other snakes
[01:27:25.583 --> 01:27:29.513]  Well, it turns out that one of the best things is to get out of Europe.
[01:27:34.204 --> 01:27:34.865]  We're good to go.
[01:28:02.028 --> 01:28:03.590]  Yeah, we've got to stop being passive.
[01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:05.191]  We've got to stop being afraid.
[01:28:05.191 --> 01:28:06.553]  We've got to stop conforming.
[01:28:06.553 --> 01:28:07.253]  That's right.
[01:28:07.253 --> 01:28:08.575]  Well, we've got to be individuals.
[01:28:08.575 --> 01:28:10.356]  I mean, that is the biggest solution overall.
[01:28:10.356 --> 01:28:12.098]  And the internet is great for that.
[01:28:12.098 --> 01:28:12.759]  Pardon me?
[01:28:12.759 --> 01:28:14.380]  And the internet is great for that.
[01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:16.362]  And we've got to be willing to go through pain, folks.
[01:28:16.362 --> 01:28:17.363]  That's right.
[01:28:17.363 --> 01:28:19.946]  Break your bone bones.
[01:28:19.946 --> 01:28:23.069]  Well, the best things in life come from breaking your own bones.
[01:28:23.069 --> 01:28:24.791]  I certainly understand what you're saying there.
[01:28:24.791 --> 01:28:25.271]  No, it's true.
[01:28:29.690 --> 01:28:33.973]  Well, I'm not into that anymore, but let them try to accommodate.
[01:28:33.973 --> 01:28:35.354]  I'll accommodate them.
[01:28:35.354 --> 01:28:39.116]  Alex, I grew up in Odessa, where bones are broken every night for fun.
[01:28:39.116 --> 01:28:39.597]  Same here.
[01:28:39.597 --> 01:28:41.718]  I grew up, same thing, Texas.
[01:28:41.718 --> 01:28:45.301]  Up where I came from in Dallas, it was people going to the hospital every weekend.
[01:28:45.301 --> 01:28:46.281]  I love living in Austin.
[01:28:46.281 --> 01:28:50.304]  It's not like that.
[01:28:50.304 --> 01:28:50.824]  It was crazy.
[01:28:54.195 --> 01:28:56.716]  No, believe me, I've certainly moved away from it as well.
[01:28:56.716 --> 01:29:01.597]  I've probably got a lot fewer brain cells, and now I'm a little bit older, and it hurts where I got a compound fracture.
[01:29:01.597 --> 01:29:03.577]  It hurts where I broke my hand over and over again.
[01:29:03.577 --> 01:29:10.919]  Now, I want to get you back very, very soon, but in 30 seconds, John Young, you're saying Big Bombshell's coming soon?
[01:29:10.919 --> 01:29:13.399]  Yep.
[01:29:13.399 --> 01:29:16.600]  Because that's the pattern.
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:21.541]  Everyone that Weekly Leaks has put out has been followed by another one somewhat more shocking.
[01:29:23.266 --> 01:29:26.208]  And this is, as you know, this is a well-known technique boxers use.
[01:29:26.208 --> 01:29:32.413]  They slowly build up and just start overwhelming you with unexpected greater attacks.
[01:29:32.413 --> 01:29:36.116]  Are there any other big tidbits that you can give us today?
[01:29:36.116 --> 01:29:37.578]  Yeah, I think they're going to come out with some bank stuff.
[01:29:37.578 --> 01:29:39.459]  I think they're going to come out... Tell you what, stay there.
[01:29:39.459 --> 01:29:40.520]  I've got another guest coming up.
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:42.061]  We're going to push him back five minutes.
[01:29:42.061 --> 01:29:43.803]  I want you to talk about what you see coming up next.
[01:29:43.803 --> 01:29:44.923]  Then we're going to get our next guest on.
[01:29:44.923 --> 01:29:46.385]  We'll hold him five minutes to the next hour.
[01:29:46.385 --> 01:29:47.906]  We'll get Lord Monkton on right after.
[01:29:51.052 --> 01:29:54.997]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.997 --> 01:29:57.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.575 --> 01:30:05.138]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:05.138 --> 01:30:06.038]  Number one.
[01:30:06.038 --> 01:30:09.461]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.461 --> 01:30:10.341]  Number two.
[01:30:10.341 --> 01:30:15.224]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.224 --> 01:30:15.965]  It's true.
[01:30:15.965 --> 01:30:20.828]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.828 --> 01:30:21.668]  Number three.
[01:30:21.668 --> 01:30:25.251]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.251 --> 01:30:28.953]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.153 --> 01:30:29.953]  Number 4.
[01:30:29.953 --> 01:30:32.714]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.714 --> 01:30:36.395]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.395 --> 01:30:37.175]  Number 5.
[01:30:37.175 --> 01:30:41.316]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.316 --> 01:30:46.378]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:46.378 --> 01:30:50.539]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:50.539 --> 01:30:52.340]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:52.340 --> 01:30:56.941]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:31:01.225 --> 01:31:16.721]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:31:16.721 --> 01:31:20.405]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:34.172]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:31:34.172 --> 01:31:41.438]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:31:42.119 --> 01:31:52.485]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:31:52.485 --> 01:31:56.427]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:31:56.427 --> 01:31:59.529]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:32:00.256 --> 01:32:04.439]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:32:04.439 --> 01:32:10.844]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:32:10.844 --> 01:32:18.230]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:32:18.230 --> 01:32:23.114]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:32:23.114 --> 01:32:25.256]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:32:28.058 --> 01:32:31.766]  Or see them online at FiveStarSoap.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:32:31.766 --> 01:32:35.493]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:32:36.027 --> 01:32:42.790]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:46.672]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:32:46.672 --> 01:32:54.756]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:32:54.756 --> 01:32:55.216]  Thank you.
[01:33:02.145 --> 01:33:08.175]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:33:08.175 --> 01:33:10.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:13.633 --> 01:33:18.514]  According to this deep university research, prescription drugs are the leading cause of death in the U.S.
[01:33:18.514 --> 01:33:22.075]  We're going to talk to Professor Donald Light, coming up here in about five minutes.
[01:33:22.075 --> 01:33:34.278]  Then Christopher Monckton will be joining us from Mexico, down in Cancun, with incredible intel for us on the big megabanks trying to set up a planetary feudal serf system.
[01:33:34.278 --> 01:33:39.899]  Finishing up with the original Wikileaker, the cypher punk insider,
[01:33:41.139 --> 01:33:45.223]  Krypton's lead individual John Young.
[01:33:45.223 --> 01:33:49.266]  We got about four minutes left with you John and obviously we appreciate you coming on.
[01:33:49.266 --> 01:33:58.534]  I've seen invaluable information come out that we know that Microsoft and Yahoo don't like how they just spy and steal everything basically and sell it to the government.
[01:33:58.534 --> 01:34:00.615]  That was in Wired Magazine now last week.
[01:34:00.615 --> 01:34:02.377]  You know the fact is we live in
[01:34:02.677 --> 01:34:02.817]  Yep.
[01:34:02.817 --> 01:34:03.398]  Here it is.
[01:34:03.398 --> 01:34:03.978]  Here's a list.
[01:34:03.978 --> 01:34:05.520]  And it may offend some of your listeners.
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:07.141]  Here are the sacred cows as they come out.
[01:34:07.141 --> 01:34:10.204]  Files on weapons of mass destruction, nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological.
[01:34:28.678 --> 01:34:29.579]  We're good to go.
[01:34:41.585 --> 01:34:45.307]  I'll buy and share it among the world's military and spy agencies.
[01:34:45.307 --> 01:34:47.928]  Files of clandestine spy agencies and their operatives.
[01:34:47.928 --> 01:34:50.489]  Files on human rights abuses.
[01:34:50.489 --> 01:34:54.611]  For example, the secret Red Cross reports on the world's prisons.
[01:34:54.611 --> 01:34:57.713]  Files of billionaire political meddlers.
[01:34:57.713 --> 01:35:03.175]  Files of the major banks and their attorneys, and most crucially, files of all the nation's tax agencies.
[01:35:03.175 --> 01:35:05.056]  The one key thing that keeps government going.
[01:35:07.248 --> 01:35:09.429]  Unbelievable.
[01:35:09.429 --> 01:35:13.511]  Here's one that I think is probably maybe the model for all of us.
[01:35:13.511 --> 01:35:26.016]  What I call the crown jewels of secret information are the 2,000 year history of the Vatican's meddling in the world's governments and working with the most evil empire the earth has ever seen.
[01:35:26.016 --> 01:35:29.477]  Second to that is the Islamic version of those files.
[01:35:32.219 --> 01:35:35.482]  Wow, now let's go back to this Vatican situation.
[01:35:35.482 --> 01:35:40.265]  We know the Vatican was involved, that's Open Intelligence, founding the Euro.
[01:35:40.265 --> 01:35:42.587]  We know it loves to hide itself.
[01:35:42.587 --> 01:35:49.873]  We know that now Lord Blackheath and others are talking about a Foundation X, richer than any government, you know, on Earth.
[01:35:49.873 --> 01:35:54.877]  I mean, more and more stuff that was so secretive that we'd talk about 15, 20 years ago, 30, 40 years ago, it's now coming out.
[01:36:00.574 --> 01:36:09.918]  It all points towards an overall attack on the internet, using the internet to cause such havoc that it rushes the world towards some type of collapse.
[01:36:09.918 --> 01:36:12.779]  I mean, but briefly, go back to the Vatican here.
[01:36:12.779 --> 01:36:14.680]  That's incredible.
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:23.343]  Specifically, from insiders at WikiLeaks, and you're an insider, you're saying that you've been told Vatican dirt's about to come out.
[01:36:24.574 --> 01:36:30.936]  Well, I'm saying that all the world's spy agencies are based on Vatican techniques and skills.
[01:36:30.936 --> 01:36:34.157]  They are the keeper of secrets beyond all others.
[01:36:34.157 --> 01:36:35.858]  They are the spy beyond all others.
[01:36:35.858 --> 01:36:36.758]  That's what Hitler said.
[01:36:36.758 --> 01:36:38.059]  He said it was the Jesuit model.
[01:36:39.522 --> 01:36:40.062]  We're good to go.
[01:37:03.249 --> 01:37:10.335]  And so, and taxation derives from the Vatican, or Vatican-like operations.
[01:37:10.335 --> 01:37:16.321]  It's how you extort money from the people, scaring them and offering salvation.
[01:37:16.321 --> 01:37:19.644]  And so, that's what's coming.
[01:37:19.644 --> 01:37:28.932]  Okay, in order, in closing, in the order you went is when this is going to be coming out, or is it a mix and match?
[01:37:30.299 --> 01:37:36.021]  The next one will be a, they claim they got a hard disk from a major bank.
[01:37:36.021 --> 01:37:37.521]  Some people are saying it's Bank of America.
[01:37:37.521 --> 01:37:43.183]  Now there are a lot of these hard disks floating around because banks use these as sting operations, as does FBI.
[01:37:43.183 --> 01:37:46.824]  So WikiLeaks is not sure they got a real one, but they say they've got one.
[01:37:46.824 --> 01:37:49.125]  And they've been trying to authenticate it.
[01:37:49.125 --> 01:37:53.287]  And since banks are a popular target now, that's probably something like that will come out.
[01:37:53.287 --> 01:37:57.308]  But don't forget, they always hit us with a bombshell we didn't expect, so it could be a ploy.
[01:37:59.231 --> 01:38:03.277]  Uh, it's possible that something will come out of, say, like the Clinton Foundation or something.
[01:38:03.277 --> 01:38:07.523]  Uh, you know, they're very astute picking something that will be popular.
[01:38:07.523 --> 01:38:09.586]  Alright.
[01:38:09.586 --> 01:38:12.511]  That's why they play the anti-American card.
[01:38:12.511 --> 01:38:14.013]  Because that's very popular outside the U.S.
[01:38:14.770 --> 01:38:15.671]  I don't
[01:38:30.486 --> 01:38:40.733]  I want to thank you for coming on, but hopefully I can get you on the Sunday show and have you on, and you can just use the acronym, you know, Baloney.
[01:38:40.733 --> 01:38:43.915]  But thank you so much coming on from Cryptome.org.
[01:38:43.915 --> 01:38:49.499]  Amazing information there on the site, and I look forward to talking to you in the near future.
[01:38:49.499 --> 01:38:58.265]  I'm going to have my producer call you in about five minutes to see if I can get you on for a full hour coming up Sunday to really go over the bombshells you just dropped on us.
[01:38:58.265 --> 01:38:58.565]  Thank you.
[01:38:59.085 --> 01:38:59.566]  Take care, Alex.
[01:39:09.793 --> 01:39:13.275]  So many things going on, so many things happening.
[01:39:13.275 --> 01:39:17.238]  For the next 25 minutes, we're gonna have Donald Light.
[01:39:17.238 --> 01:39:27.345]  He is a low-key visiting professor at Stanford University and professor of comparative healthcare at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.
[01:39:27.345 --> 01:39:34.169]  He is an economic and organizational sociologist who compares health care systems and pharmacological policy.
[01:39:34.169 --> 01:39:37.292]  As a founding fellow of the Center for Bioethics,
[01:39:37.952 --> 01:39:46.037]  He has become concerned about how few new drugs are clinically much better than existing ones, yet causing substantial risk to patients.
[01:39:46.037 --> 01:39:53.902]  Prescription drugs are the fourth leading cause of death, from the numbers I've seen it can be the leading cause, and result in 2.2 million hospitalizations a year.
[01:39:53.902 --> 01:39:58.365]  Professor Light is a co-author and editor of the Risk of Prescription Drugs 2010.
[01:39:58.365 --> 01:40:06.211]  His research has appeared in leading medical and social science journals, and I've got
[01:40:07.051 --> 01:40:21.902]  The book right here, The Risk of Prescription Drugs, Columbia University Press, Social Science Research Council Series on Privatization of Risk, and it's got the boil down here, How Do Prescription Drugs Become a Leading Cause of Death?
[01:40:21.902 --> 01:40:27.486]  The Risk of Prescription Drugs, and the numbers I've seen in the news are 300,000 drug-related deaths.
[01:40:27.486 --> 01:40:32.490]  That's almost rivaling heart attack, cancer, and automobile accident.
[01:40:32.490 --> 01:40:35.892]  So is it the fourth, the third, the second, the first?
[01:40:36.713 --> 01:40:37.374]  Does it matter?
[01:40:37.374 --> 01:40:42.237]  I mean, you hear these drug ads and, oh, having trouble, needing to urinate a lot?
[01:40:42.237 --> 01:40:42.958]  Well, take this.
[01:40:42.958 --> 01:40:48.162]  Now, it'll give you brain cancer, have a heart attack, you may go insane, make you suicidal, blood clots, but it doesn't matter.
[01:40:48.162 --> 01:40:51.764]  Call your physician if you think this is right for you, because you're a doctor.
[01:40:51.764 --> 01:40:52.365]  It's incredible.
[01:40:52.365 --> 01:40:58.930]  So we've got him on with us for the next 25 minutes, and we'll certainly have him back up again for a full hour in the future.
[01:40:58.930 --> 01:41:00.511]  Professor Light, thank you for joining us.
[01:41:01.297 --> 01:41:08.764]  Well, it's a pleasure, and I've been reading about all the great things that you've been doing, these wonderful documentary films and interviews.
[01:41:08.764 --> 01:41:10.125]  It's very impressive.
[01:41:10.125 --> 01:41:12.587]  I'm really delighted to be talking with you.
[01:41:12.587 --> 01:41:14.509]  Well, I'm delighted to have you on with us, sir.
[01:41:14.509 --> 01:41:17.771]  We've got limited time, so I'm going to try to sit back and shut up.
[01:41:17.771 --> 01:41:26.059]  If you were talking to an auditorium at a city council and you had 25 minutes to talk to them, what would you say?
[01:41:27.652 --> 01:41:37.904]  Well, you've summarized the main finding that we had in this little book that's only the size of a 5x7 photograph and only 160 pages long.
[01:41:37.904 --> 01:41:47.895]  It was written for general lay audiences with short, easy-to-read chapters, and it describes, as you say, that most of the new drugs
[01:41:48.616 --> 01:41:49.377]  We're good to go.
[01:42:08.712 --> 01:42:18.319]  We're judged clinically to be superior to existing drugs, and all the rest were judged to add little value.
[01:42:18.319 --> 01:42:19.380]  Now, why is that?
[01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:35.612]  Well, that's because the FDA approves drugs against placebo, placebo meaning a pill that is inert, and you don't know whether you're taking the active new drug or the placebo, and that's what is done in a clinical trial.
[01:42:36.272 --> 01:42:46.019]  And then you see whether the people who took the active drug got better against some criterion that the trial is for.
[01:42:46.019 --> 01:42:56.887]  But that means that when the FDA approves new drugs as more effective and better, and drug companies talk about it as being more effective, what they really mean is more effective than an inert pill.
[01:42:58.159 --> 01:43:04.501]  In fact, the FDA is prohibited from ruling whether new drugs are better than existing drugs.
[01:43:04.501 --> 01:43:15.124]  And on the safety side, they approve them as safe with very little evidence about their safety because the trials are designed to minimize evidence of safety.
[01:43:15.124 --> 01:43:22.046]  And so the actual evidence they have about whether these drugs are safe for you is pretty minimal.
[01:43:24.326 --> 01:43:28.689]  Well, an example I would use, Professor, is I know how to read the insert of a drug.
[01:43:28.689 --> 01:43:31.091]  I mean, I'm not a rocket scientist, but I can read it.
[01:43:31.091 --> 01:43:32.352]  And Gardasil...
[01:43:34.949 --> 01:44:00.676]  Vaccines they admitted in the trials killed quite a few people it caused autoimmune responses and then of the hundreds of different papillomaviruses They admitted it only covered six or so and then it said this may not even stop you from getting cervical cancer and then the literature went on to admit that it's only killing a few thousand people a year and that's normally a treatable and so the the the benefits
[01:44:01.676 --> 01:44:15.444]  Are far outweighed by the dangers, but Merck just comes into Texas, gives a bunch of money to the politicians, and they come out and say, hey little girls, and now they're saying little boys, you gotta take this so you don't get this cancer virus.
[01:44:15.444 --> 01:44:17.806]  I mean, right there, it's just incredible.
[01:44:19.028 --> 01:44:20.589]  Right.
[01:44:20.589 --> 01:44:24.970]  I was told that doing the interview with you is like quickly going 60 miles an hour.
[01:44:24.970 --> 01:44:26.991]  So you're absolutely right.
[01:44:26.991 --> 01:44:33.853]  I'm not an expert on Gardasil, but you've put your finger on the new blockbuster era.
[01:44:33.853 --> 01:44:35.954]  So the companies have figured out
[01:44:36.474 --> 01:44:45.780]  That they can make vaccines or vaccine-like things that they will call vaccines, because the definition is being broadened, for a wide number of conditions.
[01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:54.605]  And about every half year, we will see a new vaccine, while for the last 25 years, you didn't see a new vaccine very often.
[01:44:54.605 --> 01:45:00.609]  And the prices will be about $70 a dose, or often you need two or three of those.
[01:45:00.609 --> 01:45:01.189]  It'll be like $200, $300, $400.
[01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.970]  And you're right that there are
[01:45:07.108 --> 01:45:19.538]  The vaccine advocates and the companies sort of market to the public officials in the Department of Public Health or the Centers for Disease Control simply to get these things on a list.
[01:45:19.538 --> 01:45:31.768]  So it's easy, cheap marketing, then it becomes part of the requirements for what children should take, and you're right that it's a real worry.
[01:45:32.995 --> 01:45:53.701]  Well, it just builds it in that the business model of these companies is to come lobby government to push something on you, but your book, I mean, it goes over the real evidence of how much harm these drugs are causing, and more and more of medicine is just, here, take these drugs.
[01:45:53.701 --> 01:45:56.982]  So continue going through the serious risk that we're looking at here.
[01:45:57.742 --> 01:46:09.510]  Okay, well, one thing I think it's worth saying is that drug companies are amongst our most enlightened and sophisticated corporations, and they do a lot of serious good science.
[01:46:09.510 --> 01:46:17.595]  And I live in an area where there are a lot of people who work for drug companies, and there are lots of wonderful employees at those companies.
[01:46:17.595 --> 01:46:22.938]  But what I find disturbing are what must be executive decisions that are being made
[01:46:24.079 --> 01:46:36.788]  You know, many layers above by the people pulling down several million dollars a year in salaries and bonuses, above all the good staff people at drug companies.
[01:46:36.788 --> 01:46:50.798]  And one of the main things is that they repeatedly are heavily advertising to people to take drugs for things that they were not tested for or approved.
[01:46:50.798 --> 01:46:52.579]  In the last two years, Alex,
[01:46:54.403 --> 01:47:01.322]  Drug companies have paid six billion dollars in fines from prosecutions by attorney generals.
[01:47:03.195 --> 01:47:09.521]  For illegal marketing and getting people to take drugs for reasons that are not approved.
[01:47:09.521 --> 01:47:16.046]  This includes Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer is the biggest, $2.3 billion in fines.
[01:47:16.046 --> 01:47:31.159]  The last two years, Eli Lilly, $1.4 billion, GlaxoSmithKline, $400 million, Sanofi, Merck, Eli Lilly, every one you've ever heard of, Abbott, and then ones that you probably haven't heard of, I mean, listeners may not have heard of.
[01:47:32.628 --> 01:47:56.025]  All aggressively promoting to your doctors and to all of us through advertising, which by the way, you know, we're one of only two countries in the world that allow direct-to-consumer advertising because the whole idea behind prescription drugs was for 50 years that it was your doctor who decided whether you
[01:47:57.435 --> 01:48:03.898]  Needed a certain drug and it was the doctors whose job it was to stay on top of development.
[01:48:03.898 --> 01:48:11.441]  Now with this direct advertising, they're getting patients to go and tell the doctor what to prescribe.
[01:48:11.441 --> 01:48:13.842]  And often for a condition that's not been tested for.
[01:48:16.940 --> 01:48:21.184]  Well, I mean, it just gets crazier and crazier by the minute.
[01:48:21.184 --> 01:48:22.104]  Yeah.
[01:48:22.104 --> 01:48:36.117]  So, I mean, one simple thing that we recommend at the end of this little book, which is only $15, I think it's the cheapest book that Columbia Press has ever published, and it was... I make no money on it.
[01:48:36.117 --> 01:48:39.640]  It was funded by the MacArthur Foundation in Chicago.
[01:48:40.841 --> 01:48:47.107]  And they just paid us fees to do the writing that we did, so we get no royalties.
[01:48:47.107 --> 01:48:53.794]  But I just think people need to read this little book and learn about this issue and talk about it and protect themselves.
[01:48:53.794 --> 01:49:01.242]  So one thing that's recommended in the last short chapter is that whenever a drug is prescribed for an unapproved use,
[01:49:02.143 --> 01:49:07.966]  Which is called off-label, but I think unapproved use really puts it on the, you know, on the table clearly.
[01:49:07.966 --> 01:49:10.587]  Is assigned consent.
[01:49:10.587 --> 01:49:18.531]  So your doctor should hand you a piece of paper, might have one sentence saying, I understand that this prescription is being given to me by my doctor.
[01:49:19.455 --> 01:49:22.737]  For a condition for which it has not been approved.
[01:49:22.737 --> 01:49:24.717]  And I agree.
[01:49:24.717 --> 01:49:30.260]  You know, I think if most of your listeners were handed a piece of paper like that, they'd say, well, doctor, what's going on?
[01:49:30.260 --> 01:49:31.581]  Why are you doing this?
[01:49:31.581 --> 01:49:38.244]  I mean, we see doctors and clinics that aren't even checking to see what other medications you're on.
[01:49:38.244 --> 01:49:40.625]  And I see even young people now with big
[01:49:41.485 --> 01:49:44.688]  You know, tables just full of different pills they're taking.
[01:49:44.688 --> 01:49:45.208]  Right.
[01:49:45.208 --> 01:49:47.770]  I mean, and then all these weird drug interactions.
[01:49:47.770 --> 01:49:48.711]  What are the numbers?
[01:49:48.711 --> 01:49:49.751]  What do we know?
[01:49:49.751 --> 01:49:54.155]  I mean, how many people a year die from these drug interactions?
[01:49:54.155 --> 01:49:59.799]  Well, the total estimated deaths from hospitalized patients is 111,000.
[01:49:59.799 --> 01:50:04.923]  But as you said so well at the beginning, it was a wonderful introduction you gave to this talk.
[01:50:06.463 --> 01:50:14.353]  We don't know how many more because that doesn't count all the people who die at home, at work, driving, walking.
[01:50:15.491 --> 01:50:19.993]  And so forth, so it's a very limited measure that we have.
[01:50:19.993 --> 01:50:29.556]  And there's one of the things that really appalls me is here is the, roughly, the fourth, or as you say, it might be the third leading cause of death.
[01:50:29.556 --> 01:50:35.458]  And there are relatively few tracking, efforts to track and detail studies.
[01:50:35.458 --> 01:50:41.681]  So when you ask, well, how many people die from, you know, drug interactions from what's called polypharmacy taking?
[01:50:42.461 --> 01:50:45.683]  You know, two, three, four, five drugs.
[01:50:45.683 --> 01:50:50.505]  I can't think of a study that actually does more than just, you know, guess what that is.
[01:50:50.505 --> 01:50:54.067]  So, we only know about the surface of the tip of the iceberg.
[01:50:54.067 --> 01:50:54.827]  Stay there, Professor.
[01:50:54.827 --> 01:50:57.348]  We're going to come back and continue to discuss this on the other side.
[01:50:57.348 --> 01:50:58.309]  Then Lorne Monkin's coming up.
[01:51:01.098 --> 01:51:02.399]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.399 --> 01:51:07.984]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.984 --> 01:51:13.008]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.008 --> 01:51:18.053]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.573 --> 01:51:23.794]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[01:54:23.753 --> 01:54:28.216]  And of course the Constitution says Congress will control the issuance of currency and credit.
[01:54:28.216 --> 01:54:32.439]  The Fed has absconded with that power.
[01:54:32.439 --> 01:54:33.820]  And here's the Bloomberg headline.
[01:54:33.820 --> 01:54:35.020]  It's now official.
[01:54:35.020 --> 01:54:39.303]  Ron Paul, author of In the Fed Lead, Fed Oversight Panel.
[01:54:39.303 --> 01:54:47.008]  That was in question last week and we made it the number one search term to stop Boehner from blocking it and to call Boehner's office.
[01:54:47.008 --> 01:54:47.788]  The presumptive
[01:54:49.605 --> 01:54:50.466]  New Speaker of the House.
[01:55:01.776 --> 01:55:02.637]  I don't
[01:55:22.887 --> 01:55:27.150]  A few people dying from terrorism, but more people die from bee stings every year.
[01:55:27.150 --> 01:55:30.553]  But then meanwhile, you've got one of the major causes of death.
[01:55:30.553 --> 01:55:38.138]  And I see wilder and wilder ads for drugs where it sounds like the side effects are a thousand times worse than what it's treating.
[01:55:38.138 --> 01:55:43.002]  So I'm glad your book is really trying to bring some light to this, Professor Light.
[01:55:43.002 --> 01:55:44.603]  And tell folks where they can get the book.
[01:55:45.303 --> 01:55:52.005]  Oh, well, the best place is Amazon, and you just put in the risks of prescription drugs.
[01:55:52.005 --> 01:56:12.131]  My website is PharmaMyths.net, that's P-H-A-R-M-A-Myths, M-Y-T-H-S dot net, because I've also been looking into the claims by companies that it costs an average of $1.3 billion in research and development to bring a new drug to market, extremely expensive,
[01:56:12.911 --> 01:56:27.555]  And when you break down their numbers, and all the numbers are created by economists who are retained by the companies, it comes out to be a small fraction of that because they use all kinds of inflators to puff the number up.
[01:56:27.555 --> 01:56:31.797]  Wow, I look forward to having you back on for a full hour in the near future.
[01:56:31.797 --> 01:56:34.197]  Professor, give us that website one more time.
[01:56:34.197 --> 01:56:39.459]  It's pharma myths, pharma, m-y-t-h-s dot
[01:56:40.246 --> 01:56:42.708]  Net, and it's the risk of prescription drugs.
[01:56:42.708 --> 01:56:46.970]  And I thought I'd give you one example if we have a minute of a misleading ad.
[01:56:46.970 --> 01:56:50.432]  So, this is an ad for Lipitor about a few days ago.
[01:56:50.432 --> 01:56:56.455]  It starts with saying, did you know more than 80% of people who have heart attacks have high cholesterol?
[01:56:56.455 --> 01:56:58.156]  Now, how is that misleading?
[01:56:58.156 --> 01:57:05.320]  Well, because although it's true, 90% of the people who have cholesterol don't have heart attacks.
[01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:06.601]  It's a different denominator.
[01:57:06.601 --> 01:57:08.262]  If you start with all the people with heart attacks,
[01:57:09.008 --> 01:57:14.154]  Most of them have ten fingers and 80% of them have cholesterol.
[01:57:14.154 --> 01:57:28.011]  But if you start with the millions and millions of people with high cholesterol, very few of them have heart attacks and the evidence is quite clear now that taking statins to lower cholesterol in people who do not already have a risk of heart disease
[01:57:29.878 --> 01:57:36.845]  Well, now they want to put statins in the water.
[01:57:36.845 --> 01:57:38.486]  Have you seen those announcements?
[01:57:38.486 --> 01:57:44.492]  I mean, is Big Pharma just going to take over our total, you know...
[01:57:45.533 --> 01:57:46.374]  Economy?
[01:57:46.374 --> 01:57:51.757]  I mean, it's like GMO, closely allied with Big Pharma, basically the same group.
[01:57:51.757 --> 01:57:56.661]  You know, oh, we don't want you to know this is a GMO salmon that's part insect or part eel.
[01:57:56.661 --> 01:57:59.803]  Oh, we don't want you to know this goat's part insect.
[01:57:59.803 --> 01:58:04.326]  Oh, we don't want you to know that corn in studies caused all sorts of birth defects.
[01:58:04.326 --> 01:58:06.287]  Oh, I mean, just on and on and on.
[01:58:06.287 --> 01:58:08.429]  Professor, great having you on.
[01:58:08.429 --> 01:58:11.031]  Look forward to talking to you again in the future when I've had a chance to read the book.
[01:58:11.451 --> 01:58:12.412]  See you next week.
[01:58:12.412 --> 01:58:12.752]  You bet.
[01:58:12.752 --> 01:58:13.232]  Take care.
[01:58:13.232 --> 01:58:14.473]  Alright.
[01:58:14.473 --> 01:58:14.973]  Alright, buddy.
[01:58:14.973 --> 01:58:17.734]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:58:17.734 --> 01:58:23.157]  We're going to be right back, ladies and gentlemen, after this break.
[01:58:23.157 --> 01:58:31.462]  And then at 8 after, we've got Lord Christopher Monckton with Key Intel coming up from what's going on down in Mexico with the UN meeting.
[01:58:31.462 --> 01:58:34.964]  I've got some other important news I want to hit on in the brief segment coming up.
[01:58:34.964 --> 01:58:37.405]  Hour number 3 is 70 seconds away.
[01:58:37.405 --> 01:58:40.587]  Don't forget, PrisonPlanet.tv, Samuel Gadsden, The Radio Show.
[01:58:44.688 --> 01:58:50.714]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.714 --> 01:58:54.957]  You may be arrested and or subject to public police action.
[01:58:54.957 --> 01:58:56.239]  Tyranny is here.
[01:58:56.239 --> 01:59:00.102]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:59:00.102 --> 01:59:02.404]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:59:02.404 --> 01:59:07.809]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:59:08.249 --> 01:59:14.919]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:59:14.919 --> 01:59:20.907]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:59:20.907 --> 01:59:24.573]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:59:25.073 --> 01:59:29.356]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:59:29.356 --> 01:59:35.300]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:59:35.300 --> 01:59:38.862]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:59:38.862 --> 01:59:40.843]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:59:40.843 --> 01:59:41.964]  It's here.

[01:59:53.809 --> 01:59:56.195]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.195 --> 01:59:58.961]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.489 --> 02:00:10.331]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.331 --> 02:00:11.911]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.911 --> 02:00:13.452]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.452 --> 02:00:17.653]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.653 --> 02:00:21.715]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.087 --> 02:00:33.389]  You're watching us on PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:00:33.389 --> 02:00:35.430]  We punched up Fox News Live.
[02:00:35.430 --> 02:00:37.391]  And it makes no sense.
[02:00:37.391 --> 02:00:38.632]  We've been watching it for a while.
[02:00:38.632 --> 02:00:42.115]  Is this police burning down a California bomb home?
[02:00:44.093 --> 02:00:45.614]  I mean, what does that mean?
[02:00:45.614 --> 02:00:53.501]  I mean, if they think there's a bomb in there, why would they burn it down instead of going in and diffusing it or using a robot?
[02:00:53.501 --> 02:00:58.506]  Authorities have set fire to a suburban San Diego home.
[02:00:58.506 --> 02:01:05.512]  They say it was so packed with homemade explosives, they had no choice but to burn it to the ground.
[02:01:05.512 --> 02:01:06.853]  Okay.
[02:01:06.853 --> 02:01:08.134]  Who knows if it's even true now?
[02:01:08.134 --> 02:01:09.896]  I mean, they're burning the evidence down?
[02:01:09.896 --> 02:01:10.837]  Authorities are using
[02:01:12.844 --> 02:01:13.564]  Blow that up for me.
[02:01:13.564 --> 02:01:15.666]  I can't read it across the room, thanks.
[02:01:15.666 --> 02:01:18.287]  Again, I'm reading it off a telescreen across the room here.
[02:01:18.287 --> 02:01:26.913]  Authorities are using helicopters and air pollution sensors to monitor the controlled burn for potential health problems.
[02:01:26.913 --> 02:01:37.019]  The house was rented by an out-of-work software consultant who allegedly assembled an astonishing quantity of bomb-making material that included chemicals used by Middle Eastern suicide bombers.
[02:01:37.699 --> 02:01:40.461]  Investigators are still trying to understand his motivation.
[02:01:40.461 --> 02:01:43.463]  Authorities say the fire should be over within a few hours.
[02:01:43.463 --> 02:01:49.908]  Well, obviously it's a type of explosive they believe isn't going to blow up, but I mean, will they show up at my house?
[02:01:49.908 --> 02:01:56.073]  That I guess I might have a bag of black cats and smoke bombs left over from 4th of July.
[02:01:56.073 --> 02:01:58.474]  I mean, are they going to, uh,
[02:02:01.926 --> 02:02:03.227]  This is crazy.
[02:02:03.227 --> 02:02:07.770]  I mean, are they going to blow my house up and say, oh, there were bombs in there.
[02:02:07.770 --> 02:02:09.211]  We had to burn it up, though.
[02:02:09.211 --> 02:02:15.855]  You know, they did that to get rid of the witnesses that the government had staged the Madrid bombings six, seven years ago.
[02:02:15.855 --> 02:02:19.158]  And it came out that that was staged in the Spanish news.
[02:02:19.158 --> 02:02:23.961]  And so they just went and blew up the entire apartment building that the terrorists were supposedly in.
[02:02:23.961 --> 02:02:25.162]  That's how you get rid of your witnesses.
[02:02:25.162 --> 02:02:26.783]  You just blow the whole building up.
[02:02:26.783 --> 02:02:28.204]  That is very suspicious.
[02:02:28.644 --> 02:02:29.925]  What you're seeing right there.
[02:02:29.925 --> 02:02:32.586]  How are they going to prosecute this supposed person in court?
[02:02:32.586 --> 02:02:34.027]  I mean, how do we know anything?
[02:02:34.027 --> 02:02:38.870]  I don't believe a word they say, especially the San Diego PD.
[02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:39.270]  Who knows?
[02:02:39.270 --> 02:02:39.951]  It might be true.
[02:02:39.951 --> 02:02:41.812]  It's just insane.
[02:02:41.812 --> 02:02:51.758]  Eight police officers seriously injured in battle with a mob of anarchists, probably their own officers, outside Parliament as the MPs vote through the rise in student fees.
[02:02:52.478 --> 02:02:57.882]  We're going to come back with Lord Monckton here in just a moment, but first I want to tell you about an amazing Christmas gift.
[02:02:57.882 --> 02:03:01.285]  I know that'll make those that are waging war against Christmas mad, but I will say it.
[02:03:01.285 --> 02:03:03.726]  Christmas, Christmas, Christmas, Christmas, Christmas.
[02:03:03.726 --> 02:03:09.551]  Continuing, Renew Tech Solutions is offering the ultimate knife at the ultimate price, the Fox Karambit.
[02:03:09.551 --> 02:03:10.712]  It's an incredible knife.

[02:03:15.936 --> 02:03:21.420]  The ring featured helps keep the knife secure in place and help prevent slipping and being disarmed.

[02:06:01.937 --> 02:06:05.961]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:06:05.961 --> 02:06:09.205]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:06:09.205 --> 02:06:13.990]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:06:13.990 --> 02:06:20.397]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:06:20.397 --> 02:06:22.640]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:06:23.160 --> 02:06:24.781]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:06:24.781 --> 02:06:25.921]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:06:25.921 --> 02:06:28.162]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:06:42.068 --> 02:06:49.332]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:08:17.863 --> 02:08:21.926]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.560 --> 02:08:25.443]  Well, the headlines are everywhere.
[02:08:25.443 --> 02:08:34.293]  Record cold temperatures in Cancun for the Global Government Summit that Lord Christopher Moncton is attending and covering.
[02:08:34.293 --> 02:08:38.138]  And we're going to be going to him in just a moment from the Yucatan Peninsula in Cancun.
[02:08:39.528 --> 02:08:41.730]  Southern Mexico.
[02:08:41.730 --> 02:08:54.100]  Here's this week news reporting irony alert the unusually chilly global warming summit in Cancun the reporting record low temperatures areas of Europe are reporting the coldest temperature since the 1560s the 1650s 1670s
[02:08:57.923 --> 02:09:07.230]  Mrs. Monckton, the wife of the third Viscount of Brinchley and Monckton, she can't get out of the house in Scotland for 14 days because they're snowed in.
[02:09:07.230 --> 02:09:09.472]  I've talked to Paul Watson, who's over in England.
[02:09:09.472 --> 02:09:12.074]  It's just the coldest in his lifetime he's seen.
[02:09:12.074 --> 02:09:15.496]  Now, that doesn't mean the earth is necessarily getting colder.
[02:09:15.496 --> 02:09:18.338]  Every time there's a hot summer, they say it means we're getting warmer.
[02:09:18.338 --> 02:09:20.320]  You have to go through long periods.
[02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:21.381]  You have to study it.
[02:09:21.381 --> 02:09:23.963]  There's always microclimates that are having extreme weather.
[02:09:23.963 --> 02:09:26.385]  But it does illustrate that we know in the last 15 years
[02:09:27.405 --> 02:09:31.846]  The warming trend stopped and is now going down.
[02:09:31.846 --> 02:09:34.187]  But we hope for a warming trend.
[02:09:34.187 --> 02:09:36.087]  We hope for more carbon dioxide.
[02:09:36.087 --> 02:09:36.887]  That's the science.
[02:09:36.887 --> 02:09:39.828]  We've gone over that with Lord Monckton at Nauseam.
[02:09:39.828 --> 02:09:47.990]  His website, scienceandpublicpolicy.org, really is the preeminent site to really get the true research.
[02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:52.931]  But instead of going over just the background, I want to talk about what they're politically trying.
[02:09:52.931 --> 02:09:55.492]  They've shifted from saying the sky is falling warming to
[02:09:56.272 --> 02:10:06.537]  Overpopulation, Ted Turner saying get rid of people, they've got TV ads running showing children being blown up by explosives if they don't agree to cut their carbon footprint.
[02:10:06.537 --> 02:10:14.240]  They're calling for eco-fascism and calling it fascism and saying green fascism is good, not about the environment.
[02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:16.501]  None of us who have children want a bad environment.
[02:10:16.881 --> 02:10:28.164]  It's about power grabs and collectivism, and Lord Monckton, to give us a rundown for the next 50 minutes, graciously just got to his hotel out of a storm there with the police escorting him.
[02:10:28.164 --> 02:10:32.445]  It sounded like a tornado or a tempest was going on around him.
[02:10:32.445 --> 02:10:44.429]  He's now gotten to cover, and we're going to talk to him via cell phone from Cancun, Mexico, with so much happening as a global freeze hits much of the planet.
[02:10:44.429 --> 02:10:45.069]  Good to have you, sir.
[02:10:46.502 --> 02:10:48.223]  Well, it's very good to be with you, Alex.
[02:10:48.223 --> 02:10:53.247]  I'm now actually in the Security Centre at the Cancun Conference Centre.
[02:10:53.247 --> 02:10:58.031]  I've finally managed to get in, and there was quite a wind blowing outside.
[02:10:58.031 --> 02:10:59.251]  It's just to rain.
[02:10:59.251 --> 02:11:02.934]  It's colder than it's been since we've been here.
[02:11:02.934 --> 02:11:13.162]  In fact, now five days, they have had colder temperatures here in Cancun than have ever been recorded at this time of year since records began.
[02:11:13.622 --> 02:11:14.942]  So this is very exceptional.
[02:11:14.942 --> 02:11:17.023]  You heard about my lovely wife, Lady Monckton.
[02:11:17.023 --> 02:11:18.823]  She has snowed up at home.
[02:11:18.823 --> 02:11:25.765]  The Central England temperature record showing the Covid-ish first week of December since 1659.
[02:11:25.765 --> 02:11:35.047]  And you're quite right, Alex, to put in that cautionary note about how this doesn't mean there's no such thing as global warming or we can't be having an effect on the planet.
[02:11:35.407 --> 02:11:47.201]  What it does mean, and again you're quite right about this, is that the rate at which this global warming is supposed to be occurring simply isn't happening, and in fact proof of the matter is that in the past
[02:11:47.739 --> 02:12:05.250]  Fifteen years, as Professor Phil Jones of the University of East Anglia was recently compelled to admit when I got BBC to ask him a question about it, there has been no statistically significant global warming at all for fifteen years.
[02:12:05.250 --> 02:12:11.194]  This is beginning to be long a period to be altogether ignored as simply a blip.
[02:12:11.574 --> 02:12:22.738]  It is beginning very much to look as though, exactly as the likes of me have been saying all along, we- yes, we may get some warming, but it will be very slow, and it will be very harmless.
[02:12:22.738 --> 02:12:24.299]  It's not going to be a problem.
[02:12:24.299 --> 02:12:38.924]  However, the delegates here in Cancun are exactly the usual kind of robotic crowd of enviro-zombies that you would expect to find at these things, and they are getting around saying the planet's doomed, as you have rightly pointed out,
[02:12:39.930 --> 02:13:03.829]  Ted Turner is beginning to say what we've got to have is a global one-child policy and that dreadful movie made in the UK by one of these taxpayer-funded pressure groups showing children being blown up and their blood spattered over their classmates because they had not been willing to agree with their teacher that global warming was the worstest problem ever.
[02:13:04.469 --> 02:13:15.822]  That is the kind of hysteria that you always get when those who have been peddling a lie realise that they're not going to be able to get away with it for very much longer.
[02:13:15.822 --> 02:13:17.604]  And, are you still there?
[02:13:18.797 --> 02:13:32.749]  And one delegate recently said to one of my colleagues here, he said, oh yes, of course my colleague up there on the rostrum is talking about how terrible global warming is privately there, he said, we know perfectly well that it isn't.
[02:13:32.749 --> 02:13:40.056]  But our government has told us to say this because it sees an advantage to itself against its taxpayers and against the people of the world.
[02:13:40.516 --> 02:13:40.976]  We're good.
[02:13:57.506 --> 02:13:59.950]  Um, they are all here in profusion.
[02:13:59.950 --> 02:14:01.993]  Every sort of weird organization.
[02:14:01.993 --> 02:14:05.999]  There are gender-centered women against climate change.
[02:14:05.999 --> 02:14:08.884]  There are people dressed up as polar bears.
[02:14:08.884 --> 02:14:11.068]  All this kind of stupidity goes on.
[02:14:11.923 --> 02:14:18.467]  But behind it all, Alex, I think there is a considerable change in tone.
[02:14:18.467 --> 02:14:39.681]  What is beginning to happen is, compared with the triumphalism of Copenhagen and Poznan and Bali the previous three years, the annual jamborees of taxpayers' expense all around the world at exotic locations, what we're getting here is a much more sullen, sober, even somber movement.
[02:14:40.101 --> 02:14:45.603]  People here are beginning to realize they aren't going to get away with this for very much longer.
[02:14:45.603 --> 02:15:06.210]  And so, contrary to the report that you have seen in the newspaper about how nothing very much is going to happen here in Cancun, the bureaucracy which is trying desperately to turn itself into a world government has been failing to do so when the World Government Treaty at Copenhagen was simply thrown out.
[02:15:06.890 --> 02:15:23.758]  Now they're trying to do it by stealth, with a series of decisions at this conference, which the chairman of the conference, I've seen her note on this, thinks they're going to get away with, creating several hundred new bureaucracies, a hundred billion dollars per year from now and forever,
[02:15:24.298 --> 02:15:30.822]  from the wealthy nations of the West to be paid to the new world government.
[02:15:30.822 --> 02:15:43.510]  And this will go up to 1.5% of GDP if one of the options on the paper is adopted, which it may well be, giving this new world government a permanent revenue which will permanently grow as GDP grows.
[02:15:43.510 --> 02:15:49.855]  So we're looking at a really ambitious power grab by the nasty people who are behind this scare.
[02:15:49.855 --> 02:15:51.876]  And I'm quite worried they may yet
[02:15:52.316 --> 02:15:53.096]  Get away with it.
[02:15:53.096 --> 02:15:56.698]  I think they are going to get away with most of what I've just described here.
[02:15:56.698 --> 02:15:59.299]  And once they've got it, it'll be like the EU.
[02:15:59.299 --> 02:16:06.222]  Give them the money and give them the power, and then they become unstoppable, and they'll get more money and more power until they run anything.
[02:16:06.222 --> 02:16:06.843]  And, of course...
[02:16:07.843 --> 02:16:12.765]  Not one of these people is elected by us, the peoples of the world.
[02:16:12.765 --> 02:16:30.030]  It is all a dictatorship, which is gradually taking power from democratic nations, and from the leaders and elected representatives of those nations, and putting it into the hands of faceless bureaucrats, who we cannot elect, cannot question, cannot hold to account, cannot remove, and cannot reflect.
[02:16:30.450 --> 02:16:41.210]  Okay, now going back in past years, they were arrogant, they were celebratory, they would have these huge parties, they were the saviors of the earth.
[02:16:41.210 --> 02:16:41.270]  Now...
[02:16:42.574 --> 02:16:53.860]  They're becoming a global laughingstock, but as you said, they're now burrowing down, realizing their time is short, everything that's invested in this, and they're trying to get it through.
[02:16:53.860 --> 02:17:00.223]  But last year, you were instrumental in helping distribute the Danish tax, in analyzing it.
[02:17:00.223 --> 02:17:04.465]  The third world learned that it would basically double the amount of taxes.
[02:17:05.447 --> 02:17:07.608]  That they had to pay versus the West.
[02:17:07.608 --> 02:17:14.993]  It wasn't the freebie giveaway, that it was a death sentence to over a billion people cutting their energy.
[02:17:14.993 --> 02:17:18.815]  It's now admitted this is about shutting down industrialized societies.
[02:17:18.815 --> 02:17:22.837]  So, how are they trying to ram this through?
[02:17:22.837 --> 02:17:26.219]  What is in the different texts you've been able to see?
[02:17:26.219 --> 02:17:29.441]  Are there any secret treaties, like last time?
[02:17:29.441 --> 02:17:31.122]  Give us the intel, Lord Monckton.
[02:17:32.094 --> 02:17:41.202]  Uh, what they've done this time is they've done what one of the senior officials here, who also doesn't believe a word of this, as I say, there's a growing kind of rift in the loop now.
[02:17:41.202 --> 02:17:47.547]  You can see more and more people getting ready to jump ship as they see it going glug, glug, glug down beneath the waves.
[02:17:47.547 --> 02:17:51.310]  But one of them said, he said, what they're going for is an approach called
[02:17:51.954 --> 02:17:54.276]  Transparent impenetrability.
[02:17:54.276 --> 02:18:08.171]  And what this means is that everything I've just described to you, this extra money and the extra bureaucracies, they're all listed, they're all specified in the documents which are openly available and which nobody, including the delegates, actually reads.
[02:18:08.171 --> 02:18:12.335]  The notes by the chair on the expected outcome of this conference.
[02:18:12.615 --> 02:18:13.035]  We're good to go.
[02:18:31.282 --> 02:18:33.744]  It's 33 pages long.
[02:18:33.744 --> 02:18:41.269]  It's written in the most obscurantist, obfuscatory, obnubilating style, which is enough to send anybody to sleep.
[02:18:41.269 --> 02:18:51.355]  Now, unless you know what the code words mean, you'd never realise just how much of an expansion of centralised, undemocratic power this whole exercise is.
[02:18:51.355 --> 02:18:53.176]  For instance, let me give you an example.
[02:18:53.176 --> 02:18:55.558]  You wanted me to quote from these documents.
[02:18:55.558 --> 02:18:59.020]  They use a phrase called improving capacity building.
[02:18:59.480 --> 02:19:03.062]  In the least developed and less well-developed countries.
[02:19:03.062 --> 02:19:05.423]  And you think, that sounds wonderful.
[02:19:05.423 --> 02:19:12.006]  So you go and you talk to a few of the UN officials who draw up this garbage, and you say, what does capacity building mean?
[02:19:12.006 --> 02:19:20.930]  And it's nothing to do with industrial capacity, or economic capacity, or the capacity to live a civilized life, or educational capacity, or health capacity.
[02:19:20.930 --> 02:19:21.010]  No.
[02:19:21.750 --> 02:19:23.630]  It's bureaucratic capacity.
[02:19:23.630 --> 02:19:40.995]  What capacity building means in these documents is that there are going to be vast bureaucracies established in these less developed countries, which will come directly under the control of our new masters, the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
[02:19:40.995 --> 02:19:43.155]  That's what capacity building means.
[02:19:43.155 --> 02:19:44.936]  It occurs all the way through the treaties.
[02:19:44.936 --> 02:19:46.596]  It sounds wonderful when you read it.
[02:19:46.596 --> 02:19:50.117]  You think, oh, wow, they're really doing some good for the third world here.
[02:19:50.117 --> 02:19:50.637]  All they're doing
[02:19:51.337 --> 02:19:55.520]  Attention GCN listeners, do you have a patriot on your Christmas list that's nearly impossible to shop for?

[02:24:04.025 --> 02:24:05.587]  We're sending out an S.O.S.
[02:24:05.587 --> 02:24:06.328]  against tyranny.
[02:24:06.328 --> 02:24:13.837]  Ted Turner, third biggest landowner in the world, behind the Queen of England and Dutch royalty.
[02:24:13.837 --> 02:24:15.799]  He owns two million acres in the U.S.
[02:24:15.799 --> 02:24:17.562]  He has five children.
[02:24:17.562 --> 02:24:20.485]  He has more than 20 aircraft, more than a dozen homes.
[02:24:21.406 --> 02:24:21.886]  I don't know.
[02:24:37.817 --> 02:24:43.342]  There's plenty of gas and power for all the rich people in the U.S.
[02:24:43.342 --> 02:24:47.025]  and England that stand to make money off the carbon tax.
[02:24:47.025 --> 02:24:57.493]  Lord Monckton, I heard that you've been trying to track down Mr. Eugenics, Mr. Green, Green, Himmler, Hare, Ted Turner.
[02:24:58.826 --> 02:24:59.927]  Yes, absolutely!
[02:24:59.927 --> 02:25:17.857]  The Graf von Unto Turner, he was attending a business conference at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel a couple of days ago, here on the Sandy Strip at Cancun, and I gatecrashed the conference and went around it for a bit, until eventually the organisers came along and chased me out.
[02:25:17.857 --> 02:25:26.162]  And they said, you're not allowed in here, the only people who are allowed into this conference are people who believe that global warming is the worst possible problem ever in the world.
[02:25:26.742 --> 02:25:27.643]  And you're not allowed in.
[02:25:27.643 --> 02:25:29.524]  It was sort of baby talk they used.
[02:25:29.524 --> 02:25:31.305]  And I said, but I want to meet Mr. Turner.
[02:25:31.305 --> 02:25:32.786]  I'd like to issue a challenge to him.
[02:25:32.786 --> 02:25:38.969]  I'd like to provide some entertainment for the delegates here by having a one-to-one debate with him in front of them.
[02:25:38.969 --> 02:25:41.711]  Or is he going to run away and are you going to run away?
[02:25:41.711 --> 02:25:43.272]  He said, no sir, you're going to run away.
[02:25:43.272 --> 02:25:45.473]  We don't want your sort here.
[02:25:45.473 --> 02:25:50.236]  So clearly there is a reluctance on the part of Mr. Turner to face
[02:25:51.158 --> 02:25:55.419]  The amiable peer of the realm, Lord Monckton, on a debate about the climate.
[02:25:55.419 --> 02:25:56.579]  And why might that be?
[02:25:56.579 --> 02:26:03.421]  Well, I suspect it's the same reason, Ted, baby, as Al, baby, when I threatened to debate him.
[02:26:03.421 --> 02:26:05.281]  I sent a challenge to Al Gore.
[02:26:05.281 --> 02:26:06.602]  He also backed off.
[02:26:06.602 --> 02:26:10.742]  In fact, he's been backing off and running away for nearly four years now.
[02:26:10.742 --> 02:26:12.823]  So, Ted, if you're going to join the run,
[02:26:13.443 --> 02:26:19.108]  Join the panic, join the escape, then you just avoid debating with me face-to-face.
[02:26:19.108 --> 02:26:35.141]  I'll debate with you, Ted baby, anywhere in the world, on international television, and we'll take any format of debate that you like, as long as it's reasonably fair, and then you and I will go head-to-head, and we'll argue this thing out, and let's see who prevails.
[02:26:35.701 --> 02:26:47.849]  Now, Alex, what I would advise is whatever you do, don't hold your breath waiting for a reply from Ted Turner any more than you would have done if you'd waited for a reply from Al Gore.
[02:26:47.849 --> 02:27:02.678]  I'm getting to run out of white feathers on my estate to send to these people who are backing out of this debate because they know perfectly well, just as the delegates here, many of them privately are now admitting they know perfectly well,
[02:27:02.938 --> 02:27:06.042]  ...that there is no global warming problem.
[02:27:06.042 --> 02:27:07.684]  It is simply a chimera.
[02:27:07.684 --> 02:27:11.048]  It is simply a device used by people who have...
[02:27:12.020 --> 02:27:14.722]  Other agendas which are extremely nasty.
[02:27:14.722 --> 02:27:21.967]  Here we are effectively trying to reinstall global fascism, having just got rid of it in Europe.
[02:27:21.967 --> 02:27:28.332]  Now here we are reinstalling global fascism in the name of saving the planet.
[02:27:28.332 --> 02:27:36.538]  And as you and I know, Alex, the planet was triumphantly saved 2,000 years ago, and it doesn't need to be saved again.
[02:27:36.838 --> 02:27:47.806]  Expanding on that, James Cameron issued challenges to leading global warming skeptics, and then when leading one stepped forward, he chickened out.
[02:27:47.806 --> 02:27:53.471]  They will not debate it, and they know deep down it's an excuse to have a managed takeover economy.
[02:27:53.471 --> 02:27:55.933]  A lot of them are on record admitting that.
[02:27:55.933 --> 02:27:59.756]  What percentage of the higher-ups know it's a complete fraud?
[02:27:59.756 --> 02:28:02.698]  I mean, we know from their internal emails they know it's a fraud.
[02:28:02.978 --> 02:28:11.883]  And that they've got to hide the truth, but I mean, what percentage of them know it's a fraud, and then you've got the people in polar bear outfits, you know, running around?
[02:28:11.883 --> 02:28:19.447]  I mean, I see more and more of the camp followers realizing they were on some type of Jim Jones cult compound.
[02:28:21.568 --> 02:28:24.091]  That's a very good description of this place, I must say.
[02:28:24.091 --> 02:28:26.053]  It is a very curious religion.
[02:28:26.053 --> 02:28:33.922]  Let's start with your point about whether the higher-ups know what's really going on, that they know that there isn't a problem.
[02:28:33.922 --> 02:28:35.263]  Let me give you an example.
[02:28:35.263 --> 02:28:40.189]  At last year's Copenhagen conference, one of my colleagues here, Wolfgang Müller,
[02:28:40.769 --> 02:28:41.671]  We're good to go.
[02:28:52.347 --> 02:28:52.727]  Yeah, I think.
[02:29:23.348 --> 02:29:29.172]  Lord Monckton, Lord Monckton, we've got to go to break and that's just as well because you just covered some key info.
[02:29:29.172 --> 02:29:31.814]  Your phone for the first time was breaking up.
[02:29:31.814 --> 02:29:36.457]  Let's perhaps re-establish the line or see if it clears up during the break.
[02:29:36.457 --> 02:29:46.024]  I want you to come back because that takes us to the WikiLeaks cable, which the State Department admits is real, which you covered without having the secret documents that the U.S.
[02:29:46.024 --> 02:29:51.028]  and England were in their twisting arms last year and promising people payoffs if they went along.
[02:29:51.408 --> 02:29:54.393]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.393 --> 02:29:58.019]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.882 --> 02:30:05.425]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.425 --> 02:30:06.345]  Number 1.
[02:30:06.345 --> 02:30:09.768]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.768 --> 02:30:10.628]  Number 2.
[02:30:10.628 --> 02:30:15.511]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:15.511 --> 02:30:16.272]  It's true.
[02:30:16.272 --> 02:30:21.135]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.135 --> 02:30:21.955]  Number 3.
[02:30:21.955 --> 02:30:25.558]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:25.558 --> 02:30:29.240]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.440 --> 02:30:30.240]  Number 4.
[02:30:30.240 --> 02:30:33.001]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:33.001 --> 02:30:36.682]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:36.682 --> 02:30:37.482]  Number 5.
[02:30:37.482 --> 02:30:41.623]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.623 --> 02:30:46.665]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:46.665 --> 02:30:50.846]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:50.846 --> 02:30:52.627]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:31:04.526 --> 02:31:08.790]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[02:31:08.790 --> 02:31:13.714]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[02:31:13.714 --> 02:31:19.438]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[02:31:19.438 --> 02:31:23.101]  Not worried about them moving south.
[02:31:23.101 --> 02:31:26.644]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:31:29.205 --> 02:31:34.751]  I'm looking for America.
[02:31:34.751 --> 02:31:36.373]  We're American and be proud.
[02:31:36.373 --> 02:31:39.176]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:31:39.176 --> 02:31:43.621]  Land I left free in the home of the brave.
[02:31:43.621 --> 02:31:47.686]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[02:31:55.174 --> 02:31:59.750]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[02:32:02.560 --> 02:32:04.280]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:04.280 --> 02:32:10.001]  You've heard me talk about the delicious, easy-to-fix, and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:32:10.001 --> 02:32:14.742]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.
[02:32:14.742 --> 02:32:18.503]  Now it's that time of year again, and their holiday special is here.
[02:32:18.503 --> 02:32:25.444]  They have two holiday price packs for you to put into your reserves for a secure future or to share with others.
[02:32:25.444 --> 02:32:28.165]  The first is a 6-month bulk supply in 10 cans.
[02:32:29.185 --> 02:32:36.729]  And the second is a five-week supply of quick and easy-to-fix meals, including delicious bakery items shipped in heavy tote bags.
[02:32:36.729 --> 02:32:43.793]  Now, for a limited time, when you order two or more of these special holiday packs, you'll get free shipping on your entire order.
[02:32:43.793 --> 02:32:48.015]  Call now, 800-409-5633, or visit them at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:32:48.015 --> 02:32:50.396]  That's 800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:33:01.281 --> 02:33:15.669]  ...are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude.
[02:33:15.669 --> 02:33:24.695]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which, by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[02:33:24.695 --> 02:33:27.036]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[02:33:32.475 --> 02:33:44.699]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[02:33:44.699 --> 02:33:47.020]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[02:33:47.020 --> 02:33:49.501]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[02:33:51.658 --> 02:33:57.620]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[02:33:57.620 --> 02:34:04.903]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[02:34:04.903 --> 02:34:09.905]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[02:34:09.905 --> 02:34:12.846]  Turns out the government has the right, under U.S.
[02:34:12.846 --> 02:34:17.128]  law, to conduct secret testing on the American public under specific conditions.
[02:34:17.128 --> 02:34:20.089]  We're gonna have to work with dark side, or we're gonna spend time in the shadows.
[02:34:21.414 --> 02:34:25.498]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[02:34:25.498 --> 02:34:26.739]  Well, join me.
[02:34:26.739 --> 02:34:29.142]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[02:34:29.142 --> 02:34:32.485]  There's a need for a new world order.
[02:34:32.485 --> 02:34:38.851]  Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[02:34:47.296 --> 02:34:49.097]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:34:49.097 --> 02:34:52.779]  Lord Christopher Monckton joins us.
[02:34:52.779 --> 02:35:04.647]  His website and organization is the leading think tank really laying out the facts of this global takeover, and we are beginning to win battles and the war.
[02:35:04.647 --> 02:35:07.528]  Scienceandpublicpolicy.org.
[02:35:07.528 --> 02:35:12.431]  Our sites are infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, and prisonplanet.tv.
[02:35:12.431 --> 02:35:16.374]  We are fighting the prison planet, the collectivist and their elitist owners,
[02:35:17.254 --> 02:35:20.875]  See, the ultra-rich, many of them, are in a camp not liking free market.
[02:35:20.875 --> 02:35:25.076]  They want to use government to shut everybody else down because they can't compete.
[02:35:25.076 --> 02:35:31.758]  And Lord Monckton is fighting them and routing them to the ends of the earth and they run from him in literal fear.
[02:35:31.758 --> 02:35:33.698]  I've seen video activists have shot.
[02:35:33.698 --> 02:35:43.580]  It is as if the mild-mannered Lord is Darth Vader or something or a giant bucket of holy water to a vampire.
[02:35:43.580 --> 02:35:45.441]  Now, I have the London Guardian
[02:35:46.241 --> 02:36:00.632]  Report here, Lord Monckton, where they admit, and the State Department admits this in its anger, they admit it's a real cable, that other governments were all freaked out by the threats, the bribes, the promises of money, the arm twisting.
[02:36:00.632 --> 02:36:03.274]  We see the United States at the center along with
[02:36:04.455 --> 02:36:29.626]  Gordon Brown, the disgraced Prime Minister, former Prime Minister, spearheading this, trying to ram it through on people, and you knew that at the time, but now that's all come out, and that was mirroring what you were talking about, the Pakistani minister who's been promised money, up there spewing all this, it's the end of the world, oh my gosh, the West did it, because they've been promised money, this is now confirmed, it just shows what incredible fraud this is.
[02:36:31.340 --> 02:36:36.503]  The whole thing is nonsense, but let's be nice to the bedwetters.
[02:36:36.503 --> 02:36:39.405]  Let's make this be nice to bedwetters week.
[02:36:39.405 --> 02:36:52.874]  And let us pretend, just for the sake of argument, Alex, that in fact there is every bit as much of a global warming problem as the United Nations would like to imagine.
[02:36:52.874 --> 02:36:56.136]  It is of course imaginary, but it is... Let's just pretend.
[02:36:56.816 --> 02:36:58.618]  Just for the sake of a game.
[02:36:58.618 --> 02:37:13.455]  Alright, now we know that at this conference they are going to try to bully the countries of the West, who are all too eager, most of them, to comply, to hand over a hundred billion dollars of Western taxpayers' money.
[02:37:14.136 --> 02:37:15.357]  To the UN.
[02:37:15.357 --> 02:37:29.008]  Of course, the name of the game is this is supposed to go to third world countries to help them to adapt to the consequences of the terrible global warming that we in the West have caused by our emissions of carbon dioxide.
[02:37:29.008 --> 02:37:32.030]  But, let's just pretend for a moment that they're right.
[02:37:32.030 --> 02:37:37.794]  A hundred billion dollars a year is a trillion dollars every ten years.
[02:37:37.794 --> 02:37:42.138]  Now the thing is this, that in order to forestall
[02:37:43.067 --> 02:37:46.397]  Just one Celsius degree of warming.
[02:37:47.256 --> 02:37:48.176]  If the U.S.
[02:37:48.176 --> 02:38:06.041]  government was right in its figures for how much the Waxman-Markey bill would cost, which has a fairly typical lot of range of measures like cap-and-trade and regulations on emissions and all that kind of thing, then you would need to spend $100 billion a year for 340 years in order to forestall just one Celsius degree
[02:38:14.504 --> 02:38:19.331]  That Al Gore says is going to make all the coastal cities disappear within seven years.
[02:38:19.331 --> 02:38:23.076]  So, a 300-year solution to a seven-year problem.
[02:38:24.318 --> 02:38:42.234]  That's right, and not only that, but if you wanted to forestall all 3.4 degrees Celsius, which is about 6 Fahrenheit of warming, which the UN says might happen on the globe by 2100 in the next hundred years, then it would take you 1000 years of spending
[02:38:45.337 --> 02:38:45.878]  We're good to go.
[02:39:04.916 --> 02:39:14.401]  Nobody anywhere in the world had sat down and worked out and said, OK, supposing we spend all this money, how much global warming will we actually forestall?
[02:39:14.401 --> 02:39:18.563]  It's all been done on the basis of, suppose we spend the money, maybe it will make a contribution.
[02:39:18.563 --> 02:39:23.045]  Nobody has worked out that, in fact, it makes practically no difference at all.
[02:39:23.045 --> 02:39:27.368]  So even if there were a problem as big as these nitwits here, there is.
[02:39:28.308 --> 02:39:39.112]  Yes, the fact is that all the spending that they are proposing to make, and it's incredibly expensive spending, would not make anything like enough difference even to begin to look away at the problem.
[02:39:39.112 --> 02:39:52.458]  And this leads to the obvious conclusion that if there were to be any problems arising from warmer weather, and frankly if you find any global warming, send us some in Scotland, my lovely wife could do this pretty badly, then if there really were,
[02:39:53.338 --> 02:40:12.678]  What we would simply do is to say, look, we'd be better off adapting to the warmer weather and its consequences in a focused way, and only when necessary, rather than squandering all these billions and trillions now on what is an entirely futile exercise.
[02:40:14.196 --> 02:40:16.878]  Lord Monckton, you got cut off by the break earlier.
[02:40:16.878 --> 02:40:26.684]  You were trying to tell the story of the Pakistani minister telling you that the other Pakistani minister was just saying it because they've been promised money.
[02:40:26.684 --> 02:40:31.848]  That's now confirmed by the cables that this secret arm-twisting was going on.
[02:40:31.848 --> 02:40:34.970]  Recap that because your phone was breaking up at that time.
[02:40:35.962 --> 02:40:36.723]  Yes, certainly.
[02:40:36.723 --> 02:40:40.045]  In fact, I think I mistakenly said this was in Copenhagen last year.
[02:40:40.045 --> 02:40:53.614]  In fact, it was Bonn this year, at which one of my colleagues, Wolfgang Müller, who is from the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, which I also belong to, it's an environmental group that believes in looking after the environment rather than worrying about global warming.
[02:40:54.274 --> 02:40:57.197]  And we're here under the aegis.
[02:40:57.197 --> 02:41:06.585]  He was sitting next to one of the two Pakistani delegates at the discussions in Bonn, which were leading up to this conference here in Cancun.
[02:41:06.585 --> 02:41:14.873]  And the other delegate was up on the platform speaking and saying, oh, it's all terrible, we're doomed unless we shut down the economy to the West, all this kind of rubbish.
[02:41:15.533 --> 02:41:28.971]  And his colleague was sitting, talking to Wolfgang Muller, not really realising that we were on the other side of the ocean, saying to me, no, actually, neither of us believe a word of this nonsense, but our government has told us to say it.
[02:41:28.971 --> 02:41:30.073]  And of course, we've seen this.
[02:41:30.513 --> 02:41:37.755]  Time and time again before, governments spinning in vehicles into changing their view and becoming alarmist.
[02:41:37.755 --> 02:41:46.517]  India has just decided it's going to change its view and start accepting compulsory caps on the amount of carbon dioxide it emits.
[02:41:46.517 --> 02:41:52.839]  And it's doing this but almost certainly because somebody has offered it a very large sum of bribe to do that.
[02:41:52.839 --> 02:41:58.160]  We had it in Russia when the Russian Academy of Sciences got a report from
[02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:15.764]  Dr. Andrei Illarionov, who was one of its key scientists in 2004, saying, look, we've had a conference at which we invited sceptics and we invited the British government to send its chief scientist to tell us why there was a problem and we had the sceptics as well.
[02:42:15.764 --> 02:42:19.125]  And the chief scientist, on realising the sceptics were there, walked out.
[02:42:19.125 --> 02:42:20.445]  He couldn't answer our questions.
[02:42:20.905 --> 02:42:34.191]  So, Ilarionov then made an impassioned speech saying that Sir David King, who was then the Chief Scientist, had let down the name of Britain, let down the name of Sir, and had certainly convinced him that there was no problem at all with global warming.
[02:42:34.191 --> 02:42:37.312]  Of course, King was trying to say the exact opposite.
[02:42:37.312 --> 02:42:46.916]  So, then six months later, Tony Blair went to see Gazputin, the new Tsar of all the Russians at that time, and said to him, look, if you want to get
[02:42:47.416 --> 02:42:56.023]  Entry into the World Trade Organization on highly favorable terms, we want you to shut Dr. Ilarionov and the Russian Academy of Sciences up.
[02:42:56.023 --> 02:43:00.226]  Get them to change their view and become a true believer in the new religion of global warming.
[02:43:00.226 --> 02:43:08.612]  Because that way, all of us in the governing class can, and I'm going to use a rude word here, can screw the ordinary people of the world.
[02:43:08.612 --> 02:43:13.716]  And of course, Putin changed his mind, ordered the Russian Academy to do the same.
[02:43:14.056 --> 02:43:18.342]  And these are the very nasty little games that are being played.
[02:43:18.342 --> 02:43:21.926]  But of course, the more they play these games, the more they get caught out.
[02:43:21.926 --> 02:43:27.514]  Because, you know, the great thing about bureaucracies is that most of the people who are in these bureaucracies are actually good people.
[02:43:28.303 --> 02:43:30.145]  They're trying to do a decent job.
[02:43:30.145 --> 02:43:35.289]  They can see that the maniacs who are in charge of the asylum are dishonest and corrupt.
[02:43:35.289 --> 02:43:36.830]  And so they then leak info.
[02:43:36.830 --> 02:43:39.272]  One of them has the courage to stand up and say so.
[02:43:39.272 --> 02:43:40.733]  And that's how we get the WikiLeaks.
[02:43:40.733 --> 02:43:42.674]  That's how we get the Climategate emails.
[02:43:42.674 --> 02:43:45.356]  That's how we get the story from the Pakistan minister.
[02:43:45.356 --> 02:43:49.580]  That's how I got Andrei Ilarionov to tell me personally what I've just told you.
[02:43:50.951 --> 02:43:51.572]  Unbelievable!
[02:43:51.572 --> 02:43:55.575]  So you were told directly by the head of the Russian Academy of Sciences that this went on.
[02:43:55.575 --> 02:44:01.079]  That is a huge news story in and of itself, showing how they do this by hook and by crook.
[02:44:01.079 --> 02:44:06.282]  Now, shifting gears, we know these people love to play the part of savior of the earth.
[02:44:06.282 --> 02:44:07.643]  They're also control freaks.
[02:44:08.584 --> 02:44:17.890]  The White House science czar agrees with Ted Turner in writings that he wants to sterilize us with chemicals in the water and he wants one-child policies.
[02:44:17.890 --> 02:44:27.116]  He's also told the Associated Press in the first press conference he gave almost two years ago that he wants to geoengineer the planet to save us.
[02:44:28.236 --> 02:44:30.458]  from environmental degradation.
[02:44:30.458 --> 02:44:34.081]  And we know Bill Gates, who's pushing this, has bought the patents for it.
[02:44:34.081 --> 02:44:42.427]  So another way they want to tax us is for the world having to pay them to, quote, save us from the global warming.
[02:44:42.427 --> 02:44:53.235]  Then they get to play the part of, like, Superman, savior of the world from Lex Luthor, the Boogeyman, Bizarro, and the rest of Superman's enemies.
[02:44:53.235 --> 02:44:54.736]  We have an Activist Post article,
[02:44:56.437 --> 02:45:01.501]  I mean, what types of bizarre craziness are you hearing from these people?
[02:45:23.075 --> 02:45:30.943]  Well, of course they are talking of forced relocations because of the imagined sea level rise, which also, incidentally, isn't happening.
[02:45:30.943 --> 02:45:38.451]  Sea level is rising at around 8 inches to 1 foot per century, as it has done as best we can work it out for the last century and a half.
[02:45:38.451 --> 02:45:40.553]  Before that, the records aren't too good.
[02:45:40.553 --> 02:45:45.078]  But we can tell from ice cores and geological records that over the last
[02:45:45.658 --> 02:45:46.399]  We're good to go.
[02:46:06.434 --> 02:46:07.114]  We're good to go.
[02:46:32.746 --> 02:46:41.172]  Uh, yet again change all the science because it means that the warming effect of CO2, paradoxically, is a lot less than the UN had formerly thought.
[02:46:41.172 --> 02:46:48.056]  So we're getting all these people advocating more and more extreme, absurd, and above all expensive solutions.
[02:46:48.056 --> 02:46:50.377]  And also, of course, very immoral solutions.
[02:46:50.377 --> 02:46:55.601]  You know, the idea of saying to people, you can only have one child because we say so.
[02:46:56.653 --> 02:46:57.714]  It's outrageous!
[02:46:57.714 --> 02:47:05.917]  What they should be doing, but of course they won't do because they don't want to share their riches, is to make the poor people of the world richer.
[02:47:05.917 --> 02:47:15.662]  Because as populations become more prosperous, and they come up above the poverty line, then their rate of breeding slows down all by itself.
[02:47:15.662 --> 02:47:21.685]  You don't have to have abortion, you don't have to have artificial contraception, you don't have to have Chinese soldiers with guns.
[02:47:22.145 --> 02:47:27.189]  Shooting one of the two twins if a mother is unlucky enough to have twins, none of that needs to happen.
[02:47:27.189 --> 02:47:30.251]  All you have to do is make people more prosperous.
[02:47:30.251 --> 02:47:38.277]  That's the kind of geoengineering that the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow is in favour of, and so is the Science and Public Policy Institute.
[02:47:38.277 --> 02:47:48.685]  We visited just yesterday a village only 10 miles from where I'm standing in the conference hall, and that village had no electricity, no sanitation, no water,
[02:47:49.305 --> 02:47:52.728]  No school until a Catholic charity came and gave it one.
[02:47:52.728 --> 02:47:54.309]  And no health care.
[02:47:54.309 --> 02:47:57.231]  They have absolutely nothing except each other.
[02:47:57.231 --> 02:48:08.199]  And the Mexican government is spending all this money on airfare and conferences while its own people are starving because they don't have basic amenities like electricity.
[02:48:08.199 --> 02:48:10.721]  That's the kind of geoengineering I want to see.
[02:48:10.721 --> 02:48:12.562]  Electricity for everyone.
[02:48:12.562 --> 02:48:16.044]  Clean water and safe sewage disposal for everyone.
[02:48:19.226 --> 02:48:26.589]  That's the kind of geoengineering I want to see, but you won't hear much of that among the lunatics at this conference here in Cancun.
[02:48:26.589 --> 02:48:37.192]  And I hope you're getting the flavor, Alex, that I'm becoming very angry at this unwillingness of the world's governing class to listen to the needs of ordinary people around the world.
[02:48:37.192 --> 02:48:40.833]  It's bad enough that they spit in the face of democracy and try and take it away.
[02:48:40.833 --> 02:48:43.794]  It's bad enough that our freedom and our money are being taken away.
[02:48:43.814 --> 02:48:45.316]  Well, that was my next point.
[02:48:45.316 --> 02:48:46.497]  I mean, Ted Turner, all of them,
[02:48:59.474 --> 02:49:17.566]  Just write books, give speeches, dripping with venom, hating the third world, but even the Royal Commission in 49 in England found if the third world was industrialized, they would get a negative population growth just like has happened in Japan, Italy, England, the United States.
[02:49:17.566 --> 02:49:19.067]  Not only does it stabilize,
[02:49:20.007 --> 02:49:36.594]  For every two adults, man and woman, they start having 1.3, 1.4 children, that the West is actually dying, and the UN admits the third world's going to stabilize, 2020, at about 8,200,000,000.
[02:49:36.594 --> 02:49:48.919]  So they know, they know by de-industrializing the first world, by freezing industrialization in the developing world, that it's a death sentence, and it will hurt the environment.
[02:49:49.779 --> 02:49:57.562]  Well, I'm afraid you're understating it, Alex.
[02:49:57.562 --> 02:50:08.267]  I don't often say this to you, but really, I am so angry with these people because of their utter lack of concern, lack of thought, and lack of the use of reason.
[02:50:08.267 --> 02:50:14.929]  What is it that differentiates us from all the other creatures in the visible creation?
[02:50:14.929 --> 02:50:18.571]  It is that we have the ability to use reason.
[02:50:19.231 --> 02:50:35.440]  And the entire governing class of the world, certainly that part of it, which is assembled in large numbers here in Cancun, they are all as though they are in a lunatic asylum, as though they are simply, totally unable to use their minds at all.
[02:50:35.440 --> 02:50:42.504]  And of course, this is because they know, increasingly they know, that this whole climate rubbish is nonsense.
[02:50:42.504 --> 02:50:45.066]  But what they're doing is they are exploiting it,
[02:50:46.006 --> 02:50:47.608]  They are profiting by it.
[02:50:47.608 --> 02:50:50.410]  They're making billions out of it.
[02:50:50.410 --> 02:50:53.133]  And they're making billions at our expense.
[02:50:53.133 --> 02:50:57.637]  And, worst of all, at the expense of the third world.
[02:50:57.637 --> 02:50:58.677]  Stay there, stay there.
[02:50:58.677 --> 02:50:59.238]  Final segment.
[02:50:59.238 --> 02:51:01.480]  We're going to talk about how we stop these monsters.
[02:51:01.480 --> 02:51:04.703]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:05.183 --> 02:51:10.047]  Eighteen years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:10.047 --> 02:51:16.211]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:16.211 --> 02:51:18.633]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:18.633 --> 02:51:24.737]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:24.737 --> 02:51:28.159]  With Zero Debt in 90 Days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:28.159 --> 02:51:30.021]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:30.021 --> 02:51:32.022]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:51:32.202 --> 02:51:37.865]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days, guaranteed!
[02:51:37.865 --> 02:51:42.167]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[02:51:42.167 --> 02:51:50.231]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[02:51:50.231 --> 02:51:50.951]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguaranteed.com.
[02:51:50.951 --> 02:51:51.772]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguaranteed.com.
[02:52:00.899 --> 02:52:05.883]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:52:05.883 --> 02:52:06.864]  What have we got?
[02:52:06.864 --> 02:52:09.326]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:09.326 --> 02:52:10.327]  A republic.
[02:52:10.327 --> 02:52:12.969]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:52:12.969 --> 02:52:15.231]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:52:15.231 --> 02:52:17.273]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:52:17.273 --> 02:52:18.954]  So they think they own our land?
[02:52:18.954 --> 02:52:20.256]  They think they own our water?
[02:52:20.256 --> 02:52:20.876]  Children?
[02:52:20.876 --> 02:52:21.997]  Our education?
[02:52:21.997 --> 02:52:22.838]  Our money?
[02:52:22.838 --> 02:52:26.481]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:52:26.841 --> 02:52:30.526]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:52:30.526 --> 02:52:31.808]  You are being warned.
[02:52:31.808 --> 02:52:32.829]  We have the facts.
[02:52:32.829 --> 02:52:33.991]  We have the Constitution.
[02:52:33.991 --> 02:52:34.912]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:52:34.912 --> 02:52:35.793]  We have common law.
[02:52:35.793 --> 02:52:38.317]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:38.317 --> 02:52:42.082]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:52:42.182 --> 02:52:47.146]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:52:47.146 --> 02:52:48.648]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:52:48.648 --> 02:52:49.729]  Don't tread on me.
[02:52:49.729 --> 02:52:56.174]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:53:00.717 --> 02:53:03.618]  Going solar for cheap is as easy as 123.
[02:53:03.618 --> 02:53:09.201]  If you want to go solar but thought the setup costs were too high, now you can build your own solar panels for less than $200.
[02:53:09.201 --> 02:53:10.522]  Don't laugh!
[02:53:10.522 --> 02:53:13.463]  We've sold over 45,000 solar do-it-yourself kits.

[02:53:30.251 --> 02:53:31.512]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:53:31.512 --> 02:53:36.075]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:53:36.075 --> 02:53:41.879]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:53:41.879 --> 02:53:45.521]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:53:45.521 --> 02:53:48.243]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:48.243 --> 02:53:53.306]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:53:53.306 --> 02:53:53.547]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:53.547 --> 02:53:54.948]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:54:03.935 --> 02:54:09.701]  Yeah, there's a woman in the night starving to death.
[02:54:09.701 --> 02:54:16.509]  And it's well documented that these carbon cuts of energy will kill over a million people in the next decade.
[02:54:17.438 --> 02:54:30.771]  We're going back to Lord Christopher Monckton to talk about how we stop these people and hopefully in the next few weeks or after Christmas we can get him on to talk about briefly the aftermath of this criminal consortium meeting down in Cancun.
[02:54:30.771 --> 02:54:36.237]  They're routed but they're dangerous and they're still taking over our societies at the local level.
[02:54:36.237 --> 02:54:37.498]  Before we go back to Lord Monckton...
[02:54:38.579 --> 02:54:39.500]  Silver's way up.
[02:54:39.500 --> 02:54:41.002]  Gold's way up.
[02:54:41.002 --> 02:54:43.985]  Midas Resources bought the silver and gold when it was lower.
[02:54:43.985 --> 02:54:47.168]  They're selling it to you when it's higher at the old low price.
[02:54:47.168 --> 02:54:53.213]  But Ted is running out of those silver dollars and silver half dollars and the francs and sovereigns at the lower price.
[02:54:53.213 --> 02:54:55.316]  You've got to tell them it's the radio special.
[02:54:55.316 --> 02:54:56.997]  I don't have time to get into all of it.
[02:54:56.997 --> 02:54:58.138]  Give them a call.
[02:54:58.138 --> 02:54:59.520]  Get into silver and gold today.
[02:54:59.940 --> 02:55:00.680]  800-686-2237.
[02:55:00.680 --> 02:55:06.883]  800-686-2237.
[02:55:06.883 --> 02:55:07.984]  My job's easy.
[02:55:07.984 --> 02:55:09.905]  I promote what I believe in.
[02:55:09.905 --> 02:55:12.646]  I've been telling you to buy gold and silver for over a decade.
[02:55:12.646 --> 02:55:16.548]  When silver was $5 an ounce, when gold was $260 an ounce, did I secure you right?
[02:55:18.829 --> 02:55:20.209]  Get into silver and gold today.
[02:55:20.209 --> 02:55:20.470]  800-686-2237.
[02:55:20.470 --> 02:55:25.991]  Tell them it's the Alex Jones special to get the lower prices.
[02:55:25.991 --> 02:55:27.392]  The regular prices are great.
[02:55:27.392 --> 02:55:30.692]  We got about four minutes left, Lord Monckton, down there at the conference.
[02:55:30.692 --> 02:55:32.313]  Any other observations?
[02:55:32.313 --> 02:55:33.953]  How do we stop these people?
[02:55:33.953 --> 02:55:38.895]  What's the time frame on when we'll know if they were successful at this larcenous meeting?
[02:55:40.600 --> 02:55:49.165]  Right, in the next two days we should hear whether or not they've come to the agreement I expect them to come to, and I've outlined the main points of that.
[02:55:49.165 --> 02:56:06.674]  Huge expansion of bureaucracy, huge expansion of taxation of the West by the UN, huge growth in the Secretariat of the UN Framework Convention, which now has its own army, it has its own troops effectively, you see them now wherever you go, these UN security people who are
[02:56:07.174 --> 02:56:08.896]  Pretty nasty tights.
[02:56:08.896 --> 02:56:11.679]  They're all ex-merceries as far as I can see.
[02:56:11.679 --> 02:56:19.348]  This is growing into a kind of super state which exists wherever it decides to land and hold a conference.
[02:56:19.348 --> 02:56:20.610]  The way we stop it, I think...
[02:56:21.713 --> 02:56:23.114]  Well, he's not our president.
[02:56:23.114 --> 02:56:25.574]  He's a total globalist miscreant, but go ahead.
[02:56:25.574 --> 02:56:28.975]  Well, sir, what I'm saying is I think that what we now need to do is for America needs to leave the UN.
[02:56:49.805 --> 02:57:09.078]  Leave the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, leave the IPCC, on the ground that they are all fraudulent, corrupt, and unduly expensive, and that American taxpayers can no longer have the money taken from them, and the UN be trusted to spend it.
[02:57:09.078 --> 02:57:11.540]  I think we've got to take that all away, leave it,
[02:57:12.020 --> 02:57:32.882]  We've got to found a new organisation called the United Democracies, in which only democratic countries will be allowed to participate, and the only people who will be allowed to speak for various nations at the United Democracies and its meetings will be people whom we, the people of the democratic world, have elected to represent us.
[02:57:32.882 --> 02:57:34.424]  Because one of the big dangers, Alex,
[02:57:35.164 --> 02:57:43.212]  As the supranational organizations like this grim secretive secretariat of the UN's UN Framework Convention.
[02:57:43.212 --> 02:57:51.299]  The danger is not one of these supranational, cross-border, powerful, ever better funded organizations.
[02:57:51.919 --> 02:57:54.561]  Absolutely, Lord Monckton!
[02:58:21.991 --> 02:58:23.132]  You've been very gracious.
[02:58:23.132 --> 02:58:29.236]  Hopefully you can join us right before Christmas, in the aftermath, or after Christmas, or in the New Year, and let us know what happened.
[02:58:29.236 --> 02:58:33.278]  We're blessed to have you there, and I really appreciate you spending time with us.
[02:58:33.278 --> 02:58:34.019]  Good luck down there.
[02:58:34.019 --> 02:58:35.420]  Be safe.
[02:58:35.420 --> 02:58:37.321]  Real pleasure, and God bless America.
[02:58:37.321 --> 02:58:37.761]  All right.
[02:58:37.761 --> 02:58:38.582]  God bless you.
[02:58:38.582 --> 02:58:40.063]  Back live tomorrow with Rand Paul.
