[00:00.000 --> 00:11.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.360 --> 00:18.920]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.920 --> 00:29.720]  Texas Alex Jones before I forget I'm gonna say out of the gates we're scheduled
[00:29.720 --> 00:36.840]  in the last 30 minutes the broadcast tomorrow to have senator elect Rand Paul
[00:36.840 --> 00:42.560]  on we got Ventura with big news on multi fronts joining us next week Jesse
[00:42.560 --> 00:47.960]  Ventura today is gonna be a jam-packed transmission as well it is the ninth
[00:47.960 --> 00:55.200]  day of December 2010 on this Thursday edition we have John Young of Crypto
[00:55.200 --> 01:05.160]  really the proto or arc type of WikiLeaks and also involved at multi levels
[01:05.160 --> 01:08.680]  and what you could call the founding of the WikiLeaks type system he has a lot
[01:08.680 --> 01:15.200]  of inside intel on it so he'll be joining us coming up in about 45 minutes
[01:15.200 --> 01:22.400]  from now we've got Donald light coming on the broadcast who is a visiting
[01:22.400 --> 01:25.600]  professor at Stanford University a professor of comparative health care
[01:25.600 --> 01:31.000]  the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and he has written a book
[01:31.000 --> 01:34.760]  breaking down that one of the biggest killers if not the biggest it's right
[01:34.760 --> 01:40.040]  up there with automobile accidents are prescription drugs so they they've got
[01:40.040 --> 01:44.520]  big sis with telescreens going up saying watch for terrorists everywhere and
[01:44.520 --> 01:48.040]  don't trust your neighbor when more people die each year from bee stings
[01:48.040 --> 01:54.080]  than terrorism in this country the borders wide open 28,000 deaths you know
[01:54.080 --> 01:57.760]  about that and meanwhile we've got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and
[01:57.760 --> 02:01.140]  hundreds of thousands of deaths from these deadly prescription drugs it's
[02:01.140 --> 02:05.320]  well-known but he's done the breakdowns and and cross referenced all the big
[02:05.320 --> 02:10.440]  studies so Donald light coming on about that one of the most dangerous things in
[02:10.440 --> 02:16.840]  our society now it's not as scary looking as a man wearing a turban I'll give
[02:16.840 --> 02:22.840]  you that and it's not as much fun to run around and be afraid at night and hide
[02:22.840 --> 02:28.000]  under your bed from prescription drugs but it is arguably the number one cause
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.760]  of unnatural death in this nation and that's the government's own admissions
[02:32.760 --> 02:37.400]  that oh it's killing 300 plus thou a year it's probably a lot more than that
[02:37.400 --> 02:42.160]  flesh-eating bacteria infections out of hospitals and clinics are killing a
[02:42.160 --> 02:45.320]  couple hundred thou a year and don't worry they'll just keep giving
[02:45.320 --> 02:49.640]  antibiotics to people who don't need them I mean you better only take
[02:49.640 --> 02:54.160]  antibiotics if you can't whip it I've had strep throat and things before for
[02:54.160 --> 02:58.880]  two weeks and I won't take it until I beat it because not because I don't know
[02:58.880 --> 03:02.760]  antibiotics are great it's because I don't want to lower my immunity and then
[03:02.760 --> 03:07.320]  also contribute to growing you know more and more deadly bacteria one time I did
[03:07.320 --> 03:12.560]  break down though and take antibiotics when I a security guard jumped out of
[03:12.560 --> 03:19.120]  nowhere at the Supreme Court building I'd walked up on a Sunday when I
[03:19.120 --> 03:22.600]  Bilderberg it ended and we were there shooting some video of different
[03:22.600 --> 03:26.640]  government buildings for cutaway shots in films like you see the shots in the
[03:26.640 --> 03:30.560]  fall the Republican Obama deception and a cop jumps out and says what are you
[03:30.560 --> 03:36.040]  doing so I kind of hood turned towards even the feet on the pillars are about
[03:36.040 --> 03:42.160]  two feet tall and I turned and just gashed my shin through the jeans cut my
[03:42.160 --> 03:45.720]  shin and I didn't really kind of ignored at the time there was a little bit of
[03:45.720 --> 03:52.640]  bleeding and so I make the joke that the Supreme Court building bit me because a
[03:52.640 --> 03:56.400]  month later I had pus just pouring out of my leg and they did x-rays and it
[03:56.400 --> 04:03.120]  was rotting again I guess kind of a gangrenous type bacteria under the skin
[04:03.120 --> 04:07.880]  all around the bone and so thank God for those antibiotics are it have been saw my
[04:07.880 --> 04:12.400]  left leg off so I'm not saying antibiotics aren't magical and very
[04:12.400 --> 04:15.760]  important since they're being overused so now we got flesh eating bacteria
[04:15.760 --> 04:19.120]  running wild everywhere different different forms of it I've already
[04:19.120 --> 04:23.120]  just gotten distracted off here at the start of the broadcast I'm very good at
[04:23.120 --> 04:28.080]  that so we have a John Young Donald light and Lord Monkton joining us from
[04:28.080 --> 04:33.480]  Cancun boy big news there Ted Turner in the UN saying global one-child policy
[04:33.480 --> 04:39.480]  95% population reductions we've got to shut down the industrial society on and
[04:39.480 --> 04:44.080]  on and on just total brazen criminality masquerading as saviors of the world
[04:44.080 --> 04:50.160]  he'll be joining us from Cancun there on the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico in the
[04:50.160 --> 04:56.400]  war-torn region and we'll get into a lot more coming up on wiki leaks the economy
[04:56.400 --> 05:01.440]  you name it straight ahead key intel stay with us this is Alex Jones with five
[05:01.440 --> 05:05.680]  good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[05:05.680 --> 05:09.480]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[05:09.480 --> 05:13.560]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[05:13.560 --> 05:17.800]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the
[05:17.800 --> 05:22.080]  name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[05:22.080 --> 05:26.080]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[05:26.080 --> 05:30.440]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[05:30.440 --> 05:34.160]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[05:34.160 --> 05:38.320]  power from weather-related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[05:38.320 --> 05:42.120]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[05:42.120 --> 05:45.640]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors
[05:45.640 --> 05:50.800]  you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar
[05:50.800 --> 05:55.080]  backup.com remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to my solar
[05:55.080 --> 06:03.040]  backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365 hundreds of nations have fallen to
[06:03.040 --> 06:08.320]  tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history
[06:08.320 --> 06:12.400]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[06:12.400 --> 06:17.200]  Americans at home. I have a tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[06:17.200 --> 06:22.240]  and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as
[06:22.240 --> 06:27.440]  American citizens to pay attention. Full the Republic identifies the enemies of
[06:27.440 --> 06:32.480]  our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and
[06:32.480 --> 06:36.480]  on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, their
[06:36.480 --> 06:40.440]  arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we
[06:40.440 --> 06:44.160]  make the check out to. Today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[06:44.160 --> 06:50.160]  Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the
[06:50.160 --> 06:55.920]  Republic on DVD at infowars.com we're watching online right now in super
[06:55.920 --> 07:00.440]  high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[07:00.880 --> 07:04.840]  Hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs
[07:04.840 --> 07:09.560]  Generator. Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[07:09.560 --> 07:13.520]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[07:13.520 --> 07:17.360]  lungs. The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[07:17.360 --> 07:22.320]  pathogens and viruses. The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[07:22.320 --> 07:27.600]  with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[07:27.600 --> 07:32.200]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream. With continued legislation
[07:32.200 --> 07:36.400]  threatening the sale of nano-silver products you can now produce pure and
[07:36.400 --> 07:41.240]  endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator. Very easy to follow
[07:41.240 --> 07:46.080]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple. Go to
[07:46.080 --> 07:51.680]  www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of
[07:51.680 --> 07:57.840]  the Silver Lungs Generator. That's www.silverlungs.com
[07:57.840 --> 08:05.240]  This communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[08:05.240 --> 08:13.440]  because there's a war on for your mind. It is Thursday 9th of day of December
[08:13.440 --> 08:17.400]  2010. We're going to be live here for the next three hours. Lord Christopher
[08:17.400 --> 08:24.280]  Monkton joins us from the criminal summit where the globalists are
[08:24.280 --> 08:30.600]  camouflaging their world government feudal takeover. Their world government
[08:30.600 --> 08:35.760]  establishment of feudalism is what they're attempting. He'll be joining us
[08:35.760 --> 08:40.920]  from Cancun coming up in the last hour. Donald Light, again a researcher and
[08:40.920 --> 08:44.000]  author dealing with how the prescription drugs are causing so many
[08:44.000 --> 08:48.400]  hundreds of thousands of deaths each year here in the United States alone and
[08:48.400 --> 08:54.640]  John Young of CryptoM is going to be joining us as well coming up here in
[08:54.640 --> 09:00.640]  about 35 minutes from now. Let me just dive straight into the news and
[09:00.640 --> 09:05.320]  information. We will have Rand Paul, Senator-elect, last 30 minutes of the
[09:05.320 --> 09:09.280]  broadcast tomorrow. I want to just throw that tidbit out there. We have some other
[09:09.280 --> 09:15.040]  big surprise guests with key intel coming up on the transmission next week of
[09:15.040 --> 09:22.320]  course and I'll also be live this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. central standard time. The
[09:22.320 --> 09:29.520]  London Telegraph has reported on 2010's top searches and it's the Google
[09:29.520 --> 09:36.600]  Zeitgeist top searches of 2010 and we've actually been listed in these
[09:36.600 --> 09:41.320]  before. Before we started having Google bombs and having listeners do that we've
[09:41.320 --> 09:47.960]  had films like Endgame, Obama Deception, the name Alex Jones, InfoWars.com,
[09:47.960 --> 09:52.440]  showing up as top search trends and you can actually see that on the Google
[09:52.440 --> 09:56.080]  Trends. You'll notice Alex Jones is always being being searched and is always
[09:56.080 --> 10:00.680]  in the top hundred searches or so and again that's not oh look people are
[10:00.680 --> 10:07.520]  searching my name aren't I important? It's an indicator of the fact that we're
[10:07.520 --> 10:15.320]  having such a big effect but over the year Alex Jones was the 10th most
[10:15.320 --> 10:23.320]  popular search result in the news and current events section of Google
[10:23.320 --> 10:29.480]  Analytics so throughout the year Alex Jones was number 10. Other results were
[10:29.480 --> 10:40.800]  election 2010, rail strike, Democrat, things like that so very very interesting
[10:40.800 --> 10:44.000]  to show the effect that we're having overall there that from the London
[10:44.000 --> 10:50.720]  Telegraph today with the headline Google Zeitgeist top searches for 2010.
[10:50.720 --> 10:57.320]  Okay let's get into the financial news right now. This is really scary. You
[10:57.320 --> 11:00.640]  notice interest rates are actually going up now on mortgages even though the
[11:00.640 --> 11:06.280]  official lending rate is basically zero for the big mega banks. They get the
[11:06.280 --> 11:11.480]  Federal Reserve a large yes backed up by taxpayer money at basically zero
[11:11.480 --> 11:16.960]  percent and then we have to go out and get loans from them and you've seen
[11:16.960 --> 11:22.440]  credit cards go up now in many cases above 30 percent whereas there was low
[11:22.440 --> 11:26.160]  lending on mortgages in the attempt to get the economy going. Those have now
[11:26.160 --> 11:30.520]  spiked up in the last month. Why is all this happening? Because the decision has
[11:30.520 --> 11:35.600]  been made to devalue the dollar. To accelerate the devaluation the Chinese
[11:35.600 --> 11:39.400]  two weeks ago announced of course with the Russians they will no longer engage
[11:39.400 --> 11:46.400]  an inner trade between the two nations back and forth. The two nations that
[11:46.400 --> 11:50.280]  border each other on several areas very strong trading partners. They will no
[11:50.280 --> 11:57.320]  longer use the dollar as the World Reserve currency in their business
[11:57.320 --> 12:01.520]  exchanges so that is further damage to the dollar and there's been a lot of
[12:01.520 --> 12:04.400]  other things happening. The Arabs are moving away from using the dollar. The
[12:04.400 --> 12:08.200]  Euros moving away from using the dollar. Latin America is accelerating their move
[12:08.200 --> 12:13.040]  away from it. Africa is accelerating their move away from it because it's
[12:13.040 --> 12:18.600]  being devalued in their hands and short term as Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and other
[12:18.600 --> 12:23.880]  economists have explained here as the dollar plunges countries go in and try
[12:23.880 --> 12:28.200]  to buy it to prop it up because they've already been held hostage by having such
[12:28.200 --> 12:33.880]  giant holdings in it but now they're realizing well it doesn't matter if we
[12:33.880 --> 12:38.680]  try to prop it up short term over the long term aggregate or even on a
[12:38.680 --> 12:44.200]  yearly graph which is midterm the dollar is being devalued and the writing is on
[12:44.200 --> 12:47.680]  the wall so that is a big deal and all other major currencies are going to
[12:47.680 --> 12:52.040]  follow this as well until all currencies are debased and then they will of
[12:52.040 --> 12:56.240]  course then force everyone onto the SDR that's already in full operation which
[12:56.240 --> 13:01.040]  is a completely digital cashless system run by the IMF and World Bank and to
[13:01.040 --> 13:05.680]  give the quote currency digital currency some backup and some supposed value it
[13:05.680 --> 13:11.040]  will be under the credit and faith of the planet and the carbon taxes the VAT
[13:11.040 --> 13:17.240]  taxes the Tobin taxes the travel taxes all paid directly to the bankers that
[13:17.240 --> 13:23.160]  have engineered this collapse and now we're seeing more evidence of that CNBC
[13:23.160 --> 13:31.080]  bond prices plunge for second day on deficit fears US treasuries plunged
[13:31.080 --> 13:34.960]  yesterday Wednesday extending Tuesday sharp losses and pushing benchmark
[13:34.960 --> 13:40.800]  yields to a six-month high after a deal in Washington to extend tax cuts
[13:40.800 --> 13:48.080]  fueled fears of inflation and swelling budget deficit so it continues from
[13:48.080 --> 13:52.160]  there see if they don't suppress the economy and have a depression on Main
[13:52.160 --> 13:56.480]  Street all of these tens of trillions of dollars pumped into the global markets
[13:56.480 --> 14:04.960]  will cause inflation so the the that's why the banks don't loan this money out
[14:04.960 --> 14:08.760]  to the general public they're freezing the money is only for them to use to
[14:08.760 --> 14:15.960]  consolidate and buy up infrastructure but if they do cut taxes that will let the
[14:15.960 --> 14:20.200]  economy grow a bit more and and and and then more of that money will flow to the
[14:20.200 --> 14:25.160]  people and so that will accelerate inflation but in my view they're already
[14:25.160 --> 14:31.360]  inflating the currency they're already devaluing it and it's better to at
[14:31.360 --> 14:34.560]  least have some of our money in the short term before it's completely
[14:34.560 --> 14:39.880]  devalued than have our money devalued in the long term and have the economy
[14:39.880 --> 14:46.800]  continue to stall into a total depression but side issue continuing US
[14:46.800 --> 14:52.920]  treasuries hit my biggest sell-off in two years people are not buying them when
[14:52.920 --> 14:57.080]  when the treasury offers them on the open market people aren't buying them so
[14:57.080 --> 15:02.200]  you're having record monetization of the private Federal Reserve that takes our
[15:02.200 --> 15:07.680]  tax money we have to back this up and then buys US debt and then of course they
[15:07.680 --> 15:13.440]  get the interest on it out of nothing and China is the biggest owner of
[15:13.440 --> 15:17.280]  treasuries but right behind them is the private Federal Reserve and if this
[15:17.280 --> 15:22.760]  continues by the middle of next year CNBC is even reported that the Federal
[15:22.760 --> 15:26.320]  Reserve the private cartel will be the biggest owner of our debt so the private
[15:26.320 --> 15:30.800]  bankers completely owning us US Treasury suffered their biggest two-day
[15:30.800 --> 15:34.800]  sell-off since the collapse of Lehman Brothers following a torrid month that
[15:34.800 --> 15:42.680]  has seen borrowing cost for Western government soar see Germany Portugal
[15:42.680 --> 15:50.080]  Greece Ireland the nation's cost to borrow money from the private central
[15:50.080 --> 15:56.000]  banks that we the people back up and fund with taxes that cost is going up and
[15:56.000 --> 16:01.320]  it's been even reported by the Irish newspapers that this debt is not owed by
[16:01.320 --> 16:05.080]  the Irish people it's the banks derivatives debt but they're saying
[16:05.080 --> 16:09.240]  sorry Ireland will now be totally owned by offshore banks and we're raising your
[16:09.240 --> 16:14.240]  taxes and cutting your benefits I mean it's just pure robbery and people say all
[16:14.240 --> 16:19.040]  the Irish you know they you know the Greeks it's their fault we're all in the
[16:19.040 --> 16:23.420]  same boat together we're all being sucked dry it's just happening in a
[16:23.420 --> 16:27.440]  domino effect where the globalists suck one country dry and then move on to the
[16:27.440 --> 16:33.320]  next that's always been the model that they've used over and over again so
[16:33.320 --> 16:40.840]  continuing here Germany Japan and the US have all seen their benchmark market
[16:40.840 --> 16:46.720]  interest rates rise by more than a quarter in the past month while the UK
[16:46.720 --> 16:51.040]  has risen by nearly a fifth you could argue that we are at the next stage
[16:51.040 --> 16:54.720]  where the global cost of capital goes higher and higher see the bankers have
[16:54.720 --> 17:00.320]  ordered the thousands of trillions and they've got all these toxic assets they
[17:00.320 --> 17:04.720]  hold everybody hostage the government's raised taxes pump money into the banks
[17:04.720 --> 17:10.880]  and the banks say okay now I'm gonna raise the price for you for you to get
[17:10.880 --> 17:14.920]  that loan whether you're a government or a corporation or individual I mean it's
[17:14.920 --> 17:20.120]  total global consolidation you could argue that we are in the next stage where
[17:20.120 --> 17:24.120]  the global cost of capital goes higher and higher and that's the inflation said
[17:24.120 --> 17:29.600]  Stephen Major global head of fixed income research HSBC oh but what do you
[17:29.600 --> 17:33.440]  get at your bank you you might get 1% but the bankers they get 30% on your
[17:33.440 --> 17:39.640]  credit card you figuring this out the yields on a 10-year US treasuries hit a
[17:39.640 --> 17:46.560]  six-month high of 3.33% on Wednesday up 0.39% points from Monday and 1%
[17:46.560 --> 17:51.080]  higher than it's October low Japanese five-year yields also rose the most in
[17:51.080 --> 17:55.920]  two years while Germany's benchmark borrowed cost at 3% people are getting
[17:55.920 --> 18:00.080]  out of the market and moving to the sidelines feeling shell-shocked at the
[18:00.080 --> 18:08.720]  speed of the rise in yields said David Adler strategist for CRT capital and it
[18:08.720 --> 18:12.400]  just goes on from there this is big big news the market moves came after
[18:12.400 --> 18:15.440]  President Obama agreed with congressional Republicans to extend
[18:15.440 --> 18:19.400]  the Bush era tax cuts and combine them with a hundred and twenty billion dollar
[18:19.400 --> 18:25.000]  payroll tax holiday but investors and traders were divided on whether this was
[18:25.000 --> 18:33.440]  sufficient to explain the recent global spike in yields and here's the key the
[18:33.440 --> 18:38.080]  primary explanation is that growth expectations have increased because of
[18:38.080 --> 18:42.280]  better economic data and the stimulus second stimulus provided by the US
[18:42.280 --> 18:46.400]  government but others argue it could be due to fears that the US Federal Reserve
[18:46.400 --> 18:50.920]  will not follow through on asset purchases or because of higher government
[18:50.920 --> 18:58.920]  deficits it is probably all three said mr. Major so it continues and by the way
[18:58.920 --> 19:02.400]  they tried to suppress golden silver the last three days they're both shooting
[19:02.400 --> 19:10.960]  right back up to those all-time highs right now today okay in other news again

[19:38.400 --> 19:41.800]  and set the precedent to be able to do whatever they want and again have a

[25:33.800 --> 25:40.880]  WikiLeaks documents and the Houston press is reporting on and links to other
[25:40.880 --> 25:45.280]  mainstream news articles about it WikiLeaks Texas company helped pimp

[26:34.280 --> 26:41.880]  business at Dinecourt I mean I could play the congressional hearings right
[26:41.880 --> 26:44.760]  now for you I've played them many times you just go to YouTube and type in
[26:44.760 --> 26:52.520]  congressional hearing brings up Dinecourt and child kidnapping and they
[26:52.520 --> 26:55.480]  asked Rumsfeld about it in the committee hearing and why didn't they get in
[26:55.480 --> 27:01.040]  trouble and he says oh they don't get in trouble and they just kind of laugh
[27:01.040 --> 27:07.240]  about it it's funny to them and so when I get up here and I explain to you this
[27:07.240 --> 27:11.880]  is going on I have seen hundreds of mainstream news articles about UN
[27:11.880 --> 27:21.320]  peacekeepers Dinecourt the UN every month no matter where they are Haiti in the
[27:21.320 --> 27:27.120]  Caribbean or Africa or Asia or Central Asia it doesn't matter that's who these
[27:27.120 --> 27:35.840]  people are that's what they do and it's come out in Italian television tied in
[27:35.840 --> 27:41.200]  with some of these big contractor groups and organizations in the US with
[27:41.200 --> 27:47.120]  snuff films and I've seen the English translations of the Italian newspapers
[27:47.120 --> 27:50.960]  on this stuff the whole world knows about this but the average American where
[27:50.960 --> 27:56.840]  it'll describe two male toddlers and what they do to them and they blow their
[27:56.840 --> 28:02.320]  heads off with a with a revolver on video this is sold in the US and they
[28:02.320 --> 28:14.520]  and the and I've walked up to cops in front of the Dinecourt building in
[28:14.520 --> 28:17.760]  Austin and said you know that's Dinecourt they've been in the news involved
[28:17.760 --> 28:21.200]  in this you guys want to bust some real criminals and the cops all laughed at me
[28:21.200 --> 28:27.840]  and then one of them said the commander said yeah I work for him I do work for
[28:27.840 --> 28:31.040]  him and laughed at me and they had all like this demonic look on their faces
[28:31.040 --> 28:36.040]  like when they hear about real crime it's funny oh it's real funny it's like

[35:00.760 --> 35:04.560]  the health department which were set up over a hundred years ago as the racial
[35:04.560 --> 35:09.920]  hygiene department the US government controlling the health departments has
[35:09.920 --> 35:15.920]  sterilized millions of Americans from the 1920s right through the 1980s so if
[35:15.920 --> 35:20.280]  they come and grab you in a truck and take you and chop your uterus out oh
[35:20.280 --> 35:23.920]  they didn't just tie their tubes they went inside sometimes they do medical
[35:23.920 --> 35:28.080]  surgeries for fun they'd kill people sometimes they kill newborn babies of
[35:28.080 --> 35:32.320]  course they take your blood secretly for a DNA database people had to catch them
[35:32.320 --> 35:37.080]  in the 80s and stop the secret sterilizations and the kidnappings so
[35:37.080 --> 35:43.160]  of course they're taking your blood secretly that's now ABC news but but
[35:43.160 --> 35:49.120]  they're still trying to whitewash it all the Pentagon has your blood gee they
[35:49.120 --> 35:53.760]  think you're cattle they think they own you okay I was telling you about dying
[35:53.760 --> 35:58.200]  cord child kidnapping yesterday here it is in the wiki leaks from the US
[35:58.200 --> 36:02.560]  government going gee the Afghans are getting mad about them taking their kids
[36:02.560 --> 36:07.600]  here in America we just go oh you the neighbor saw me spank my kid here dying
[36:07.600 --> 36:13.980]  core ship little Bobby to Saudi Arabia they like to rape children I do what
[36:13.980 --> 36:17.760]  law enforcement says alright I'm gonna shut up I'm just getting really angry
[36:17.760 --> 36:23.240]  and really tired of people being in denial out there grow up and realize
[36:23.240 --> 36:27.840]  how much trouble we're in there's pure evil going on all around us just the
[36:27.840 --> 36:34.080]  average person is in denial I'm not in denial alright I'm gonna get off the
[36:34.080 --> 36:41.120]  high horse but I'm not on a high horse I'm angry I'm angry and I'm sick of it
[36:41.120 --> 36:46.160]  and I'm not the weirdo because I'm angry about major defense contractors
[36:46.160 --> 36:51.480]  involved in every crime you can imagine on record they never get in trouble
[36:51.480 --> 36:58.240]  now the next 10 minutes I want to go to Steve shank of eFoodsDirect.com
[36:58.240 --> 37:04.800]  because he's got a Christmas special that he's running right now that is so
[37:04.800 --> 37:10.720]  important and we need to get self-sufficient and this is the storeable
[37:10.720 --> 37:14.840]  food company I support that I believe in and just like he told you a year and a
[37:14.840 --> 37:17.800]  half ago because he manufactures and puts his own food you know all produced in
[37:17.800 --> 37:21.760]  America together non-gmo non-hybrid doesn't have the additives in it he
[37:21.760 --> 37:26.240]  saw the prices going up for wholesalers now the media is talking about the food
[37:26.240 --> 37:30.960]  bubble well it's not a food bubble the dollars being devalued globally and food
[37:30.960 --> 37:35.040]  is traded worldwide still in the dollar Steve shank first off you were right
[37:35.040 --> 37:40.400]  about food prices going up they're going up globally well it doesn't take rain
[37:40.400 --> 37:45.320]  surgery to figure out what's going on with this thing the fascinating
[37:45.320 --> 37:50.440]  experience that we're having is they're pumping a whole bunch of goofy money
[37:50.440 --> 37:54.560]  into the economy which is devaluing the dollar at the same time we've got
[37:54.560 --> 37:58.640]  foreclosure rates that by the way on the foreclosure rate Alex is absolutely
[37:58.640 --> 38:02.120]  absurd you hear about the percentage you see month but you don't hear about the
[38:02.120 --> 38:06.560]  cumulative stuff the people that are still out of out of their homes from a
[38:06.560 --> 38:11.320]  year ago and the jobless rates going nuts and now they've got to Senate bill
[38:11.320 --> 38:17.200]  number 510 I'm sure that you're up and down all over that one because when we've
[38:17.200 --> 38:21.200]  got a bad situation where families can't afford food now because we've got no
[38:21.200 --> 38:25.160]  jobs and they don't have homes to live in now they're wanting to control the
[38:25.160 --> 38:31.440]  ability of us to to grow our own and to be able to traffic in food it shuts
[38:31.440 --> 38:35.600]  down the truck farms it shuts down all these little farms holding on by
[38:35.600 --> 38:41.280]  selling locally the communes the co-ops that are just sprouting up
[38:41.280 --> 38:46.120]  everywhere it's panicking the system every week we see video from surveillance
[38:46.120 --> 38:52.240]  cameras of police swat teaming Amish swat teaming little farms selling eggs
[38:52.240 --> 38:57.600]  I mean they're going nuts yeah and then we've got Gerald Zelente where he's
[38:57.600 --> 39:01.840]  coming out with the absolute facts about what he has predicted before which
[39:01.840 --> 39:07.000]  he's been absolutely right on and now he's talking strictly about food we've
[39:07.000 --> 39:10.200]  we're in the fifth year of that worldwide famine Alex that you and I have
[39:10.200 --> 39:14.960]  talked about regularly we got people not just buying the treasuries now they're
[39:14.960 --> 39:21.360]  dumping their treasuries absolutely absolutely and the fact is that
[39:21.360 --> 39:28.160]  Zelente has has come out very strongly with regard to exactly what is going to
[39:28.160 --> 39:33.840]  solve the individual family's problem we can't do much about all this new world
[39:33.840 --> 39:38.440]  order stuff except be aware of it and adjust for it but the solution that we
[39:38.440 --> 39:43.360]  have there's only one it's got to be it's got to be food you know right now in
[39:43.360 --> 39:48.080]  fact in Zelente's last article that we were reading here at the office just the
[39:48.080 --> 39:55.080]  other day the dependency on food is so absolute that the true feeder freedom
[39:55.080 --> 39:59.800]  fighters right now have a food supply that's the way you fight it you fight
[39:59.800 --> 40:04.520]  for your freedom with food and that's why we've we've come up with this holiday
[40:04.520 --> 40:09.640]  thing I think everyone that knows about us realizes that every time during the
[40:09.640 --> 40:15.200]  holiday season we come up with the best shot we can at getting the most food
[40:15.200 --> 40:20.920]  into as many family homes as possible and looking at the financial structure
[40:20.920 --> 40:26.000]  that we've got in the economy right now this last one is is probably the best
[40:26.000 --> 40:30.920]  we've ever done Alex but because it's absolutely needed what we've done is we
[40:30.920 --> 40:34.640]  taken the 12 months food supply and broken it down so that you can get it in
[40:34.640 --> 40:39.800]  six month supplies but if you buy two of them the shipping is free and you also
[40:39.800 --> 40:45.480]  save $260 in addition to the savings on the shipping cost yeah you've offered
[40:45.480 --> 40:49.720]  free shipping before which I've never seen any other company do because for
[40:49.720 --> 40:53.720]  those that don't know one of the biggest expenses is the shipping because food is
[40:53.720 --> 40:58.160]  heavy this is a lot of food but then to add a discount on the food as well and
[40:58.160 --> 41:02.160]  folks the reason you go with e-foods direct number one of the biggest the
[41:02.160 --> 41:05.040]  longest continually operating others claim that they've been operating
[41:05.040 --> 41:09.080]  longer I've done the research it's not the case this is new food it's high

[41:24.720 --> 41:28.560]  hope you take advantage of this and I'm gonna be honest with you I've got family
[41:28.560 --> 41:33.680]  you know who is struggling over the years I've bought them year supplies of
[41:33.680 --> 41:39.120]  food you know because that's where I invest is in my family or whether it's a
[41:39.120 --> 41:43.800]  month supply they've got a lot of other six month specials you name it but again
[41:43.800 --> 41:49.080]  Steve give folks the specific special you're offering for the holidays and how
[41:49.080 --> 41:53.320]  long you're gonna be offering it this is a six month supply we've also got two
[41:53.320 --> 41:56.680]  other supplies that they can look up on the internet by the way on the internet
[41:56.680 --> 42:03.960]  it's e-foods direct comm slash Alex e-foods direct comm slash Alex for those of
[42:03.960 --> 42:14.560]  you that aren't all that computer savvy get on 800 409 5633 800 409 5633 and if
[42:14.560 --> 42:19.520]  you if you put together two of these these specials the shipping is
[42:19.520 --> 42:26.320]  absolutely free but on each one of them you've got $260 savings which is just
[42:26.320 --> 42:32.520]  absolutely remarkable so very simply what we've done Alex is try and get the
[42:32.520 --> 42:39.080]  very most of the very best food out for the very least so the people a lot of
[42:39.080 --> 42:43.280]  folks we did a we did a special during the Black Friday thing and we were
[42:43.280 --> 42:47.360]  absolutely amazed at the number of people that are saying heck with this
[42:47.360 --> 42:51.400]  thing we're putting our Christmas money into something that can really mean
[42:51.400 --> 42:56.640]  something for us in the in the coming well you know I was out in my garage
[42:56.640 --> 43:01.440]  this morning and looking at my storeable food the attics full of food I've got a
[43:01.440 --> 43:06.560]  three-year supply for my whole family and then I went in and checked my guns in
[43:06.560 --> 43:11.840]  the gun safe and even did a little oiling this morning and I only do that a
[43:11.840 --> 43:15.960]  few times a year but the point is just my instinct told me go look at your food
[43:15.960 --> 43:20.120]  go look at your guns and it's not that I live in fear I'm like the ant who
[43:20.120 --> 43:23.600]  prepares for the winter not the grasshopper it's that as a man and as a
[43:23.600 --> 43:29.440]  steward of my family and my community I need to be prepared and not be dependent
[43:29.440 --> 43:34.800]  on others that is the first thing I'm to do the Bible says that and anybody who's
[43:34.800 --> 43:40.880]  got half a brain knows you need God guns guts food you know your bullets your
[43:40.880 --> 43:45.920]  beans your Bibles it's very very simple and this food lasts more than 10 years
[43:45.920 --> 43:52.120]  in climate-controlled 10 years and you know I do things like after I've got
[43:52.120 --> 43:56.200]  food that's getting to be six seven years old I give it to the food bank or I
[43:56.200 --> 43:59.360]  start eating it or I take it to the deer camp or a lot of this food you're
[43:59.360 --> 44:02.760]  really tasty and good even from companies years ago I got it from before I
[44:02.760 --> 44:06.720]  knew about a foods direct but the last three waves and the last four years I
[44:06.720 --> 44:10.960]  bought from the J. Michael Stevens group eat foods direct calm because they've
[44:10.960 --> 44:13.400]  got the highest quality some of the other companies that you know you'll see
[44:13.400 --> 44:18.600]  msg or it'll have fillers or it's you know from China or whatever there's the
[44:18.600 --> 44:22.920]  government MRE's not trustworthy there's some good companies out there that
[44:22.920 --> 44:26.400]  other produce them but when you go to eatfoodsdirect.com you know it's high
[44:26.400 --> 44:31.200]  quality briefly tell folks about we got a wide spectrum of food gourmet you'll
[44:31.200 --> 44:36.240]  prepackage the raw foods you got a bunch of different things you offer well
[44:36.240 --> 44:41.160]  basically the whole idea is that if people are going to bet their lives on
[44:41.160 --> 44:46.000]  what they put into their food savings account they've got to have everything
[44:46.000 --> 44:50.720]  you've got you've got the bulk items the dehydrated foods that are the main
[44:50.720 --> 44:54.480]  state you got the neutral versus soups and chilies and breads that have the
[44:54.480 --> 45:00.200]  vitamins in them yep absolutely and they're prepared so we most of the
[45:00.200 --> 45:05.600]  prepared items are so easy there the design was based on the fact that a
[45:05.600 --> 45:10.680]  ten-year-old can prepare every one of those prepared meals and so the fact is
[45:10.680 --> 45:15.720]  that you will not find better tasting food and what's happening is that people
[45:15.720 --> 45:22.240]  are able to to to save it and they can they can use it a lot of people right
[45:22.240 --> 45:26.840]  now with the economy the way it is we've got hundreds of virtually thousands of
[45:26.840 --> 45:30.520]  people that are using this food on a regular basis to supplement their
[45:30.520 --> 45:34.080]  budget yeah you warned them years ago buy the food before the dollar devalues
[45:34.080 --> 45:37.880]  more then you have that saving later because this is really tasty food

[46:02.400 --> 46:07.520]  and depend on and I don't have to tell people that in the great depression

[46:12.760 --> 46:19.680]  from illnesses related to malnutrition and starvation that's with about 89 to
[46:19.680 --> 46:24.440]  90% depending on the study of people being agrarian or living on the farm or
[46:24.440 --> 46:29.720]  near a farm now we're right at 90% urban only half of the 10% that live on
[46:29.720 --> 46:34.560]  farms are self-sufficient with the type of depression that's unfolding prepare
[46:34.560 --> 46:39.560]  for you know the worst I'm hoping for the best but it's important ladies and

[47:25.240 --> 47:28.200]  investment it's insurance you can eat but the way this world's going it's
[47:28.200 --> 47:35.240]  important to be self-sufficient now I want to for the next 30 minutes or so
[47:35.240 --> 47:42.240]  talk to John Young the editor and one of the key founders of krypton.org it's
[47:42.240 --> 47:47.960]  been around since 1996 by independent scholars and the architect John Young
[47:47.960 --> 47:54.840]  and others and the New York Observer had a article that quoted myself the
[47:54.840 --> 48:01.000]  original wiki leaker and it's got my quote in here and I think it says it all
[48:01.000 --> 48:05.000]  that his work is very important said Alex Jones the radio host and founder of
[48:05.000 --> 48:10.640]  info wars.com I don't really know of anybody who was posting secret classified
[48:10.640 --> 48:14.640]  and restricted but also open source documents to a site and creating a
[48:14.640 --> 48:20.440]  library and they cut my quote off there I went on to say before krypton you have
[48:20.440 --> 48:24.320]  to say that he is the granddaddy of the wiki leaks type phenomenon and he was
[48:24.320 --> 48:29.440]  also knows some of the wiki leakers and has had a critical view of Assange in
[48:29.440 --> 48:35.120]  the past but now with all of this unfolding we'll get John Young's
[48:35.120 --> 48:41.920]  breakdown on what he thinks is going on here. John thanks for joining us good to
[48:41.920 --> 48:47.960]  have you here with us we're going to break in a moment but I have always
[48:47.960 --> 48:52.760]  stated that I believe Assange was being set up as a unwitting or perhaps
[48:52.760 --> 48:56.400]  witting asset of the CIA like a Lee Harvey Oswald we know there's the
[48:56.400 --> 49:03.480]  George Soros Leslie Gelb you know all of those connections there and Wayne
[49:03.480 --> 49:08.120]  Madsen has agreed with you that it's suspicious so is Webster Tarpley now it
[49:08.120 --> 49:11.920]  appears that they're going to use this as an electronic 9-11 and they're
[49:11.920 --> 49:18.360]  announcing to come in and start shutting down web freedom on the internet.
[49:18.360 --> 49:25.040]  Yeah that's a that's a kind of talk they're making now I just say that I
[49:25.040 --> 49:28.760]  think they'd like to keep this going about another ten years so they can
[49:28.760 --> 49:32.920]  keep asking for more money for it so that I think they'll keep making these
[49:32.920 --> 49:36.960]  rumbly noises and hope that wiki leaks or others like it will continue doing
[49:36.960 --> 49:43.000]  this thing because it's a tremendous way to raise funds for governments. Again they
[49:43.000 --> 49:46.760]  get to build their giant cybersecurity spying grids in the name of countering
[49:46.760 --> 49:50.560]  their own leakers. That's right and that's why they set up Cybercom almost
[49:50.560 --> 49:57.560]  holding the hands of wiki leaks to do so. Amazing well I mean when we look at
[49:57.560 --> 50:02.920]  this these women that set him up one of them is absolutely you know in Cuba
[50:02.920 --> 50:07.240]  running CIA ops I mean this is really what do you think of Assange do you
[50:07.240 --> 50:13.600]  agree they're setting him up as the fall guy? It's possible often people are set up
[50:13.600 --> 50:17.040]  with aren't with they're not being completely tweeting about it and it's
[50:17.040 --> 50:23.040]  not it's not hard to do because there's a constant drumbeat of we need to
[50:23.040 --> 50:26.720]  challenge authority we need to challenge the CIA we need to do this and that and
[50:26.720 --> 50:31.840]  so this is a fairly well-known way to get some traction for a website or
[50:31.840 --> 50:36.840]  initiative and to raise some money through it and so the the allegation of
[50:36.840 --> 50:41.640]  having sexual affairs is usually a component of that. Well they claim that
[50:41.640 --> 50:45.440]  about Daniel Ellsberg stay there segment coming up we'll continue to get

[54:11.400 --> 54:17.040]  John Young of Cryptoam.org is our guest he knows a lot about at least the
[54:17.040 --> 54:23.360]  founding and I've wiki leased some of the people involved but it's on record
[54:23.360 --> 54:27.640]  the Cass Sunstein who said that they would basically sabotage the web by
[54:27.640 --> 54:33.520]  posing as freedom fighters and leakers really introduced wiki leaks of the
[54:33.520 --> 54:38.400]  world in 2007 in an editorial in the Washington Post that he wrote so it's
[54:38.400 --> 54:44.520]  pretty much admitted this is a CIA group as Mr. Young said on the show over a
[54:44.520 --> 54:50.000]  year ago and predicted much of what's now unfolded if you're gonna have a
[54:50.000 --> 54:53.360]  trillion dollar war in Afghanistan or Iraq you got to go stage some terror
[54:53.360 --> 54:56.640]  attacks fund the opposition if you're gonna have an excuse to take over the
[54:56.640 --> 55:01.680]  web and spy on everybody you've got to finance some leaks and you see the media
[55:01.680 --> 55:05.480]  the way they supported it the way they always hype it up but I think again
[55:05.480 --> 55:09.800]  Assange is a useful dupe that they're flushing down the toilet but time will
[55:09.800 --> 55:16.800]  tell I mean specifically John walk through what you believe is happening
[55:16.800 --> 55:21.600]  here the founding of wiki leaks where you think this is going
[55:24.600 --> 55:33.000]  John give us your view on the statements I just made he must have lost our
[55:33.000 --> 55:39.080]  audio I can I can hear him typing that that happens with phones sometimes John
[55:39.080 --> 55:52.200]  Young can you hear me I will call him back okay John go through your original
[55:52.200 --> 56:00.080]  concerns about wiki leaks well as you know Alex I was in soccer punched into
[56:00.080 --> 56:03.640]  serving as a public face of wiki leaks because they didn't want any of them to
[56:03.640 --> 56:07.160]  be named in the registration of the website so I did it because I've done
[56:07.160 --> 56:11.800]  it for others and I was led to be that it was a public benefit operation but
[56:11.800 --> 56:15.320]  within a few weeks it announced that it intended to raise five million dollars in
[56:15.320 --> 56:19.400]  the first six months I said wait a minute that doesn't sound like public
[56:19.400 --> 56:27.800]  benefit to me that's how I came I have value funded program and I mentioned two
[56:27.800 --> 56:32.080]  examples CIA and Soros I didn't accuse them of that I said it would be like
[56:32.080 --> 56:35.800]  that in which deep pockets are funding some you can't just raise money by no
[56:35.800 --> 56:40.480]  no organization in that brief period of time now we know that business to that
[56:40.480 --> 56:44.280]  though with the same kind of rollout and so that was my first sense that this was
[56:44.280 --> 56:49.200]  a business operation not a public benefit operation and it's turned out to be
[56:49.200 --> 56:58.240]  that so and others may make the link to CIA and Soros by the way but both of
[56:58.240 --> 57:01.240]  you's both of whom use the same techniques of claiming to be public
[57:01.240 --> 57:05.760]  benefit but far from being the only ones churches do it educationists do it so
[57:05.760 --> 57:09.760]  forth so that public benefit is a well-known subterfuge for actually
[57:09.760 --> 57:15.520]  making pretty good money these days of course falling the government model
[57:15.520 --> 57:20.160]  okay now so I mean that's important tidbit you registered and that's been
[57:20.160 --> 57:25.040]  confirmed the WikiLeaks URL to begin with when was that John that was in
[57:25.040 --> 57:30.120]  December 2007 and have you seen the fact that it was Cass Sunstein that
[57:30.120 --> 57:36.600]  basically introduced them to the world say that again Alex it was Cass Sunstein
[57:36.600 --> 57:41.360]  who introduced WikiLeaks to the world in that Washington Post article he wrote
[57:41.360 --> 57:47.800]  in 2007 yeah and this is a guy who openly says that he would pose his
[57:47.800 --> 57:52.000]  activists on the web as a pretext to bring censorship in now they're
[57:52.000 --> 57:56.800]  introducing the legislation to do just that I mean this is pretty obvious well
[57:56.800 --> 58:00.360]  it's certainly a complicated story and need to be watched very carefully because
[58:00.360 --> 58:04.920]  I think there's a lot of smoke being blown about this and that a lot of the
[58:04.920 --> 58:09.040]  usual expulsion and accusation of being rolled out as part of that smoke
[58:09.040 --> 58:14.320]  blowing on all parties that some of the induces for WikiLeaks cars seem to be
[58:14.320 --> 58:17.840]  operating in concert with some of its opponents it's like they're in lockstep
[58:17.840 --> 58:22.600]  to me really okay stay there we're back in one minute John one minute break I
[58:22.600 --> 58:26.000]  want to try to give you the floor so that I'm not just asking the questions I

[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:19.760]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:26.640]  Alex Jones well this whole wiki leak situation is very complex but bottom line
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:32.480]  it's the pretext to bring in censorship control of the web the whole
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:37.360]  cybersecurity system being built up and John Young of Krypton.org predicted
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:42.720]  this he's again the original wiki leaker he's the guy that set up the
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:47.400]  website originally for them but then he pulled out very quickly now he said
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:51.480]  years ago looks like a Soros type operation now we have clear connections
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:55.600]  to that that's even mainstream media now I want to this is a short segment long
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:58.480]  segment coming up John but I want to give you the floor you know you talk about
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:02.680]  this you know this being foggy bring clarity I mean as somebody who probably
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:06.160]  knows more about this than anybody else in the next four minutes you've got the
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.840]  floor what do you want to say to folks about this what do you think is most
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:14.760]  important well follow the money is of course a cliche but true here is it for
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:19.960]  two and a half years wiki leaks is on the verge of bankruptcy they shut down
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:23.120]  for a few months and came back with bomb shells and suddenly the morning that
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:28.840]  the money started pouring in this is a well-known business model to hand out
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:33.880]  free cigarettes and then sell them after you get the addiction started and so
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:39.680]  that it's also a well-known government technique to create a crisis claim that
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:44.560]  we can't survive without it and then demand more taxes and more budget
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:49.280]  increases and so just just watch how this unfolds so I expect that there will be
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:54.720]  continuing crises raised by the wiki leaks model and that from low-level
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:58.880]  secrecy documents we'll start getting cripples of our secrecy documents it'll
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:03.160]  be tripled out over time as they're not ripping out the the secret stuff and so
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:06.360]  we'll get some more bomb shells because it's proven to be extremely effective now
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:10.000]  you know that we kept the war on terrorism going exactly the same way and
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.200]  so that these imaginary wars are very lucrative protected to governments and
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:18.680]  contractors who service governments as well as individuals who seem to oppose
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:23.000]  governments so I'm down on anti-war people as well as pro-war people because
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.840]  they seem to be working hand-in-hand so I think that that's the lesson we've
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:33.320]  learned running our side that there were all sorts of threats imputed to
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:37.240]  crypto none of that has come to pass it was just a shell game to make it seem
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:41.000]  like there's a threat but there wasn't we've never been we've got that except
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.040]  by one time by Microsoft which then which then was through it wiki leaks
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:50.320]  was shut down once by a court but then that was withdrawn as far as I know no
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:54.120]  officials have ever approached wiki leaks with a threat now maybe they have
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.800]  and they've kept it quiet we always publicize when we're approached by
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:02.040]  officials to let them know that this is something of a shell game so we'd like
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:07.360]  to see more attention paid to how often this occurs not by wiki leaks but by
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:11.520]  others who are rushing to their support but also rushing to oppose them there's
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:15.080]  money to be made in this and I'm talking about the media I'm talking about the
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:20.960]  the so-called outlaws the so-called dissidents this is a big-time operation
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:24.880]  everyone's getting in on this so I'm admiring this taking place so it'll be
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:29.600]  kept going for quite a while money's pouring in from all sides to both sides
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:35.240]  of the fight and so the use of the word cyber war as you know is it's exactly
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:39.680]  part of that our info war now no I'm not I'm not attacking your use of it
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:43.400]  malice because you started this long ago but right now they're actually trying to
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:47.480]  escalate this into war like crisis because it's bringing up the money yeah
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:51.600]  when I talk about info war I mean getting people talking yeah saying no to
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:56.160]  tyranny their info war they're talking about hacking and and and and more the
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:01.080]  pentagon version of that that's right and so that that's what cybercom is is
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:05.880]  now doing they're gonna milk cyber threats as much as they can over the
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:08.640]  next several years and that's why I think that the Bradley Manning thing was
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:13.160]  esteemed that you know they teach the stuff at port what you go Alex how
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:17.640]  people like Bradley Manning can do this and set up the sting operations and so
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:24.960]  he was trained there and so this smells like that to me and they'll be more
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:29.280]  coming though and because right now they're just testing the public reaction
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:33.440]  with this low-level secrecy revelation but the other stuff will come all right
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:37.440]  stay there we're gonna come back in three minutes John long segment and I
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:42.160]  want to continue to drill down into WikiLeaks I mean obviously you've got
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:47.600]  all these Soros CIA connections cast Sunstein Sunstein writing two years ago
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:52.640]  two and a half years ago that they would infiltrate the web poses activists
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:57.760]  create crisis then bring in censorship legislation that's now happening we'll

[01:07:37.600 --> 01:08:01.600]  America
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:19.600]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:26.440]  John Young of krypton.org the original wiki leaker that's the New York
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:31.160]  Observer headline he set up the site form originally then immediately got
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:38.000]  got suspicious of it and this is the pretext just like they set up al-Qaeda
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.360]  and the Taliban they're now setting this up and now they've got thousands of
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:47.960]  hackers attacking Mastercard visa Sarah Palin for calling us on John American
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:52.760]  you know I don't want to hate Sarah Palin but give me a break she said that
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:56.480]  the South shouldn't have attacked North Korea and that we've got a stand with
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:02.000]  North Korea she doesn't know that North Korea is the Stalin estate she's now
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:08.840]  come out and said that Assange is on American Assange is Australian honey but
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:13.960]  this is just getting crazier and crazier by the minute and now they've
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:22.040]  released cables dealing with Dinecore running little kidnapped boys which you
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:25.640]  see in the news all the time but there is some pretty bombshell stuff in here
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:29.840]  but could that be that the mainstream media is going through this and only
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:33.240]  covering what they want to go over because so much of what I've read and
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:36.440]  I've tried to go through a lot of it and so much what the media has picked up on
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:42.680]  really reinforces the whole war on terror propaganda and everybody who knows
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:46.520]  the basics understands just because some documents secret doesn't mean it's true
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:50.880]  I mean they have the office of special plans saying they knew where the WMD's
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:55.080]  were and that was secret so some of the biggest propaganda you see is inside
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:10:00.040]  government because it's an echo chamber of brainwashing John Young of krypton
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:04.560]  dot org what's your view on what I just said
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:12.020]  and so you couldn't believe something because it's secret top secret whatever
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:18.560]  these are major glamorizing terms and so that people inside secret keep you
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:24.160]  know this and that's why they get the stuff it takes out is the really
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:28.120]  important information is not classified in fact you can't even be between no it
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:33.120]  exists so these known classifications are our future to make it seem it's
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:36.400]  important stuff secondly these cables these cables look like they were written
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:41.000]  from reading the press rather than the other way around but as we know that's
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.480]  a common way that the information is read the press and quoted as their own
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:50.360]  views yeah they got a file report so they sit there with a word document open
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:54.080]  cutting clips out in fact that's already been pointed out that a lot of this
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:58.480]  stuff was excised right out of newspapers and not even changed so it's a
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:03.760]  bunch of neocon propaganda that's right and but that's what the media
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:08.080]  say that's what most of the media does for a living
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:14.240]  each other are one or two other stories do almost no original reporting
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:18.400]  because that takes time and they've got a deadline to meet they always say and we
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:22.240]  have limited space they always say and so we've got to go with what everyone
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:25.960]  else is doing well look well I mean they get a government press release and they
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:29.800]  put that in the article and then the embassy takes the article that's a
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:34.360]  boiled-down government press release and then puts it out as secret that's like
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:39.040]  a few months ago they made all the TSA workers top secret or secret clearances
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:43.480]  that way they can't protect themselves with a union that way they can be lied
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:47.680]  to about the terror threat that way they can feel like they're all James Bond's
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:52.480]  it's kind of like giving somebody to newspaper associate editor title in
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:58.320]  lieu of pay you hit it right on the head these are often ways to boost morale
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:01.360]  within an organization is declare something secret and let you in on it
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:06.240]  by the way they do this to presidents too as they read them into the secrecy
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:13.960]  world and shall I go on with this yeah continue yeah is that you know but you
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:17.440]  know we have all these people outside government saying we got to do this we
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:20.080]  got to do that and then they go inside and suddenly they don't say that any
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:23.280]  more it's you because they've been read into the secret where they're under
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:28.160]  lifetime threat to never disclose it then they suddenly shut up it's a one-way
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:31.840]  street and you never back out once you're in that's why there's no ex-pies every
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:36.160]  spy has lifelong secrecy built into their blood and that's why some of them
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.920]  are out there bullshitting about what they're revealing because they're
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:43.080]  under lifetime constraint and it's a serious constraint but mainly is that
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:47.920]  it's a good way to make a living being inside the secret world is an awfully
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:51.280]  good thing of course it started when the first church was set up for the first
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:55.200]  kingdom was set up so it's been around for a while Alex it's a secrecy is a
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:01.160]  narcotic against them and the biggest threat to the secret keepers are people
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:04.600]  who are outside that world not the other secret keepers in other countries or
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:10.880]  other churches but those are outside who might blow the whistle on this well I
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:16.680]  have to agree with you on this because overall it allows the dominant media
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:24.520]  that's being supplanted by alternative media to demonize the internet to begin
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:30.480]  to grow the surveillance grid towards the original incremental shutdown of the
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:34.400]  web all of this happens the web as we know it all of this happens with the
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:39.720]  backdrop of the FCC commissioner saying freedom of speech is an aberration in
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:43.160]  the media we're going to shut it down government approved all of this comes
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:48.360]  out with a backdrop of the cybersecurity legislation which just legalizes what's
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:52.880]  already is in place the cyber command admits two years ago they've been
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:57.040]  launching quote attacks against themselves to test systems we know they
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:01.400]  hire most of the hackers we know that Assange got in trouble many years ago and
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:05.080]  was kind of brought into that world but I think like Lee Harvey Oswald there's a
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:08.360]  good chance they're again setting him up or this could be all part of a big
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:12.680]  pageant kind of like Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon papers where they tried to
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:16.720]  prosecute him but then the case fell apart to give him street cred we know
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:21.840]  the naval intelligence operative a woodward was with deep throat Alexander
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:27.400]  Hague and Kissinger deep throat we know is a composite to burn Kissinger I mean
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:33.440]  to burn Nixon but so the whole way this is going it's very very clear but then
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:39.120]  you've almost got to support Julian Assange because the charges against him
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:43.240]  are clearly false I mean not wearing a condom and consensual sex by some
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:46.880]  feminist who writes articles about how to set men up in the legal system you
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:52.800]  can't make that up and so you've got to support Assange because if they're able
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:57.200]  to nail him for no reason then I can be arrested for the secret documents that
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:02.360]  I've put out that are real that they did not want people to get like the Mayak and
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:06.320]  Homeland Security reports I happen to know the one of the people that leaked
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:10.160]  me stuff they found out about other things he was doing he got in a lot of
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:15.640]  trouble but but I mean this is all just incredible stuff that's going on John
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:19.640]  you just heard me rant about you know the point about Assange I mean if we
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:24.760]  don't support him in free speech even though this is all basically a setup
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:29.400]  then doesn't it set the precedent for them to come throw John Young or Alex
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:33.760]  Jones in the huskow well it's a good point because in fact someone said on
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:38.720]  the mail is hey why is John Young I've been charged with rapes and I had to laugh
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:43.440]  at that because you see me compared to Assange you know that charge would never
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:52.240]  stand up but my point is that don't be lulled by this rape charge in Sweden
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:56.400]  there's more coming along that line this is the tip of what's coming out of
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:01.640]  Sweden and so don't forget we're on a bombshell campaign Alex and every day
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:05.440]  something unexpected happens something in a series of unexpected things will
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:08.720]  happen on that strand while other things are happening on the transfer this is a
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:13.400]  multiple stranded operation and we're we're actually being teased with the
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:18.160]  easy stuff right now to set us up for more interesting stuff well we've seen
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:21.880]  that pattern it's building building as you said and I gotta hand it to you over
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:28.120]  a year ago you you you laid it out with precision let's go back though because
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:33.480]  you've been an insider in this entire world what are your wiki leaks sources
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:37.760]  or other hacker insiders what are they telling you John that you can relate to
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:43.600]  us what bombshells can you give us well let me tell you who they are and where
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:49.720]  you can find their names you can find them on wikipedia look up the term
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:53.680]  cypher punk and I'll spell that for you if you haven't heard of it that's a PKD
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:17:01.760]  term cypher spell with a Y C Y P H P U N K cypher punk got it I tried look there
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:07.240]  and cool down the bottom and you'll see my name Sonja's name several dozen
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:13.160]  names of people who all plotted all this and are still very active in this and I
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:16.440]  started pointing to this now what you want to know what's behind wiki leaks go
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:20.920]  to this one side and you'll see the entire gang you'll see a whole bunch of
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:25.200]  links to other sources and you'll see how long this has been going on and why
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:30.360]  you're not going to be able to contain it and so that's the first thing I can
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:33.600]  tell you is this public information has been out there for years but no one did
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:38.720]  the slightest amount of research on this and so that beyond this wiki pd entry
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:42.640]  I've got the archives of the cypher punk's mail list but went on for several
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:47.320]  years all these issues were discussed this is very high-level technical
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:52.480]  material and these are not young people like Assange some of these people are
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:55.920]  extremely wealthy and they're not George Soros who's coolest technically and he
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:58.720]  thinks his billions makes him all powerful but it doesn't make him rather
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:03.600]  stupid like the CIA is stupid because of their alleged power so these are people
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:07.600]  who are much crafter than that but I'd recommend that people take a look at the
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:13.000]  cypher punk's wikipedia and study it okay I'm looking at the cypher John I'm
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.440]  looking at the cypher punks on wikipedia scroll up for me guys the top down to
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:20.040]  the bottom okay but I want to make sure I've got the right entry go to the top
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:27.480]  for me real quick it's the cypher punk entry on wikipedia and not to be
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:32.640]  confused with us with the pkd cyberpunk okay let's let's scroll the bottom now
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:37.840]  go ahead oh well don't go down the bottom you'll see a list a number of
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:42.560]  people who are involved in this I'll be there Assange is there a number of
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:47.920]  people there that you may not have heard of but the founder of EFF the founder of
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:52.920]  a number of other John Gilmore of Sun Microsystems so look down there there's
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:57.080]  some very notable people there and they got this started in the early 90s and I
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:01.720]  got on the board of in 1994 I was amazed that there was such a group like this
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:06.960]  extremely intelligent highly capable engineers scientists, cryptographers, highly
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:12.600]  political astute people Assange came on board in 1995 and there were several
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:16.840]  thousand people on this list it's an amazing okay so it's a wide spectrum of
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:22.240]  what's the overall political kernel to this is this truly independent or is
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:28.160]  this a government agency or is this a combine well I'm gonna try to give you an
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:32.120]  answer that may be a little hard to understand it is none of those the intent
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:35.440]  was to have nothing that can be attacked easily so it was so it's not an
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:41.560]  organization it's not an entity it's a concept it's a aspiration it's a goal it
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:45.400]  is not anything you're gonna be able to take down by the usual means that's the
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:48.960]  very purpose of it is to not make it and that's why I say weekly will not be
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:53.800]  taken down it'll pop up some of the way so you're saying it's almost like the
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:57.760]  internet is a bunch of computers connected to each other and can't be
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:03.280]  taken down now this is just basically hackers and computer experts that built
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:07.920]  a system that that that anybody in the group can pump info out and nobody can
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:12.760]  stop it and that's why wiki leaks people told the news yesterday to take us
[01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:19.000]  down you'll have to shut the web down that's right that's why I was set up it
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:23.520]  was set up as a spying machine I told you on your last show but that's being used
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:28.400]  for reverse spying the people who set it up as you know with the military and
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:31.880]  they set it up to induce people to join up because it's a very good way to
[01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:36.360]  surveil an entire population around the world but now the people are actually
[01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:41.640]  running it that they hired to run it are now reversing the pentopticon well
[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:45.240]  that's I mean that's what I've always said they use Google to spy on us we use
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:50.360]  Google to spy on them with the massive group collective brain that they're not
[01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:53.480]  ever gonna be able to stop because they might even have the intelligence
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:57.400]  but they don't have the personnel to deploy operations but as long as we're
[01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:03.600]  an idea a manifesto of human liberty it's unstoppable yep that's right cuz
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:07.160]  you'll have to stop themselves if they do because they set this up in our control
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:11.680]  things and the control and they're they're actually losing control so it's
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:16.880]  kind of like the Lord of the Rings analogy of Sauron he makes the ring but
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:21.440]  the ring actually controls him so to destroy so somebody can get the ring
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:25.120]  and throw it into the crack of doom this is always the outcome of imperialism
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:32.600]  it eventually destroys itself unbelievable and again you've you've had
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:35.880]  piercing understanding of this because you were involved from the start and
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:40.720]  you're telling I mean you're talking just like government people I've talked
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:44.680]  to you like Dr. Bob Bowman former head of Star Wars he'll always say well I can
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:49.120]  give you what's open source or they declassified this by mistake I can tell
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:54.160]  you this now go look at that and and and so you're saying look at this list it's
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:22:01.720]  hidden in plain view this is a system a door that swings both ways and what I'm
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:06.640]  getting from what you're saying John is that this is out of control what it is
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:12.640]  however you know the smart people all around one thing we always keep in mind
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:15.600]  that every time you think you got a clear understanding someone else smart
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:19.360]  you and so one of the things that I admire about this hyperpunk they never
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:23.480]  got completely arrogant and said that we are going to run things a few tried and
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:26.920]  they got shot down by critics who were smarter than they were so what I'd like
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:30.800]  to caution is don't think that you're going to get this easily to say it's out
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:33.840]  of control I'm saying you're gonna take some work because you'll be set up
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:39.080]  repeatedly and entrapped and as with WikiLeaks now they've got WikiLeaks
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:44.600]  redacting documents so that means the fix is in because redaction is a is a
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:49.400]  control mechanism well that shows that they're coming to him and saying don't
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:54.200]  give out our agents names will go easier on you they're already being co-opted
[01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:59.280]  yeah because because of the money the money is fabulous because they were not
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:03.400]  making money being out there on their own so now they they've raised millions by
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:08.160]  being on the inside so why not I mean well what is your inside scoop if you
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:13.760]  were offered a billion-dollar bribe you were 39 years old and had no other
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:22.880]  income think about it it's called a government contract well what's your
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:27.600]  inside Intel or your gut if you don't have the inside Intel is this a big
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:33.920]  theater with Assange or are they burning him for the theater it's a it's a
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:39.040]  theater operation part of the entertainment partly lolling partly
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:43.600]  testing systems but testing public reaction we're gonna get traction out
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:48.160]  of separate threats are not will this work or not so far you know they've
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:51.040]  not actually caused any harm that's why they haven't been charged yeah this is
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:54.440]  the beta testing now they're gonna start releasing even more that's right and
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:58.720]  then there'll be some last lost or something will happen because don't
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:04.280]  forget this is these are cheap operations to run and so somewhere because
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:08.480]  this is still a fictional war it's not a real war it's a cyber war which is all
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:13.240]  imaginary let me ask you this really harmful we'll see because the law will
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:17.800]  be ready what is your idea john young from cryptome.org the original wiki
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:21.800]  leaker what is your view your idea your and I should have you back for a full
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:26.360]  hour soon this is incredible what is I want liberty I want freedom I want my
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:30.240]  private property I don't want to be a slave I would imagine that's your view
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:33.920]  you know I don't want to be part of an empire I don't want to support all these
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:38.440]  wars in my name so so that's my view I know I'm a good guy but I know in ways
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:43.200]  I've been used as well because this is such a complex world and you can't be
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:46.880]  looking at everything at every time so so nobody's perfect but I know I'm good
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:51.320]  and I know I want to do good I mean what should I be doing from your view and
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:57.800]  and what should you be doing to somehow stop this from being used to start
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:01.440]  curtailing our speech and then the globalists they'll still be able to do
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:06.240]  what they want well it's what I was told as a kid trust no one but yourself and
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:10.880]  and warn people not to trust you so I we say on cryptome do not trust us
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:14.960]  through our ignorance we may deceive you or betray you do not trust anyone who
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:18.000]  speaks with a voice of authority and do not trust anyone who sells you
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.960]  protection do not trust anyone who sells you trust because their own ignorance
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:27.760]  and finality will betray you and so that we believe will betray Bradley Manning
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:31.680]  because they got a million reasons to do so well there was a wiki leaker that
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:37.520]  that that did ratty mount well we don't know what happened
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:42.160]  so I'll just say watching all this with considerable interest it's still not
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:45.000]  true about it but we have our various kinds of fairy tales in the media we
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.520]  haven't seen much evidence we've got a lot of talk of people who are well-known
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:53.640]  liars and most hackers are liars because it's a piece of social engineer most
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:26:01.400]  people on the internet lie I lie I'm lying to you right now keep that in
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:07.120]  mind everyone's got their agenda well when you say you lie what what you put
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:11.880]  out little disinfo involving where you live or your name well I mean you don't
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:16.200]  lie about the overall truth sir I mean you're saying you lie as like you you
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:21.520]  you take the the address numbers off your apartment door no I'll have to
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:26.400]  ignorance but I don't know any better and we'll not admit it I'll pretend that
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:31.240]  I've got access to truth about the tale and I'm delivering it to you and so that
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:35.440]  the reason I'm lying because I don't know how else to convey what I'm doing in an
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:40.520]  honest way we need to work on that everyone exaggerates you know what no
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:45.280]  one no one is perfect and I think the second guess you yourself you know I
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:50.200]  mean I'm not delivering pure truth so I'm lying to you I think it's if you
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:57.280]  consciously try to dead reckon as best you can I think veritas the proof of
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:02.840]  veritas is on the balance does 80 plus percent of what you talk about come
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:08.840]  true or 90% or does you know everything you do turn out to be wrong and I watch
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:12.760]  mainstream media they're lying on purpose we're here trying to tell the
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:16.760]  truth we get some things wrong but I mean I know there's good people John I
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:20.640]  mean I mean my whole issue is I think part of getting into this whole world
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:24.240]  that you've been part of so long is that you're so in with all these other
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:29.360]  snakes that then it starts blinding you to the fact that there are a lot of good
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:34.880]  people well and turns out is one of the best things to get out of your bunker
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:38.120]  and meet all these other people I'll say the best thing about cryptos how many
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:41.200]  people I've met how many different views I would never have known had I not
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:45.640]  opened myself up to other people's viewpoints so when I say I lie is it's
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:48.920]  only counter to lying is to help discourse with other people and stop
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:53.960]  peeking at them and listen to them closely let them attack you and don't be
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:57.320]  afraid of that because it's the only way we're going to get out of the because
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:02.280]  you know what we're taught by education to mislead people in our own yeah we've
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:05.760]  got to stop being passive we got to stop being afraid we've got to stop
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:09.200]  conforming that's right well we've got to be individuals I mean that is the
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:12.360]  biggest solution overall and we've got to be willing great for that pardon me
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:15.440]  and the internet is great for that and we've got to be willing to go through
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:21.080]  pain folks yeah that's right break break your bone bones well yeah the best
[01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:24.200]  things in life come from breaking your own bones I certainly understand what
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:27.880]  you're saying they're not going to bar and say that or someone will accommodate
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:33.160]  you well I'm not I'm not into that anymore but I let them try it to
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:38.200]  accommodate him I grew up in Odessa where bones are broken every night for fun
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:43.080]  that same here I grew up same thing Texas up where I came from in Dallas it was
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:46.520]  people going to the hospital every weekend I love living in Austin it's not
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:57.040]  like that no I believe me I'm certainly moved away from it as well I probably
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:00.440]  got a lot fewer brain cells and now I'm a little bit older and it hurts when I
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:03.800]  got a compound fracture it hurts where I broke my hand over and over again now
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:09.240]  I want to get you back very very soon but in 30 seconds John Young you're
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:16.960]  saying big bombshells coming soon yep because that's the pattern everyone
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:21.080]  that we can think is put out has been followed by another one somewhat more
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:26.320]  shocking and as you know this is a well-known technique boxers use they
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:29.960]  slowly build up and you started overwhelming you with unexpected greater
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:35.320]  attacks are there any other are there any other big tidbits that you can give
[01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:37.200]  us today I think they're gonna come out with some
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:40.480]  thanks I think good to tell you what stay there I've got another guest coming up
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:43.160]  we're gonna push him back five minutes I want you to talk about what you see
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:45.800]  coming up next then we're gonna get our next guest on holding five minutes to
[01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:52.520]  the next hour we'll get Lord Monks and on eight after we're on the March the
[01:29:52.520 --> 01:30:01.640]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with
[01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:05.400]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:08.960]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:13.280]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:17.240]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:21.560]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:25.920]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:29.680]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:33.840]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:37.080]  families lose their power from weather-related onages number five a
[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:41.000]  solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.160]  folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:47.800]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:53.400]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government
[01:30:53.400 --> 01:31:00.320]  doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:04.560]  you've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:07.720]  respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions
[01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:11.520]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:15.320]  how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:19.760]  body my name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the silver lungs
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:24.160]  generator not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:28.480]  ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:33.360]  devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas
[01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:40.520]  this includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally for the
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:44.680]  digestive system be sure to watch our new seven-minute video tour of the silver
[01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:50.960]  lung system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the silver lung
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:55.640]  system works as well we are always ready to answer any questions you may have
[01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:59.840]  that's www.silverlungs.com
[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:03.560]  Hi folks this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:07.120]  about soap not detergents but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the

[01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:08.960]  central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance you're listening
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:15.560]  to the Alex Jones show according to this deep university research
[01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:18.920]  prescription drugs are the leading cause of death in the US we're going to talk
[01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:22.760]  to Professor Donald light coming up here in about five minutes then Christopher
[01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:28.920]  Monkton will be joining us from Mexico down in Cancun with incredible intel
[01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:33.760]  for us on the big mega banks trying to set up a planetary feudal surf system
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:40.640]  finishing up with the original wiki leaker the cipher punk insider
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:46.440]  cryptones you lead individual John Young we got about four minutes left with
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:50.320]  you John and obviously we appreciate you coming on I've seen invaluable
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:54.640]  information come out that we know that Microsoft and Yahoo don't like how they
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:58.760]  just spy and steal everything basically and sell it to the government that was
[01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:03.520]  in wire magazine now last week you know the fact is we live in a system where
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:07.120]  the law is being broken by the government every millisecond but you've been
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:10.680]  covering this stuff for decades and it's invaluable in closing what are your
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:14.600]  sources telling you's coming out next what do you see happening any other key
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:19.680]  tidbits yep here it is here's a list and it may offend some of your listeners
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:29.160]  pure the sacred cows are to come out files of weapons of mass destruction nuclear biological chemical and radiological files on
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:34.320]  global WFP research laboratories in the status of research stocks war plans of
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:38.440]  all nations foreign against one another reports and training literature on
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:42.880]  bright on black prisons and torture chambers held by and shared among the
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:47.320]  worlds of military and spy agencies files of pesticides by agencies and
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:51.880]  their operatives files on human rights abuses for example they're the secret
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:56.000]  red cross reports on the world's prisons files of big about billionaire
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.880]  political methods files of the major banks and their attorneys and most
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:04.320]  crucially files of all the nation's tax agencies the one key thing that keeps
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:11.800]  cover much going unbelievable here's one that I think is probably maybe the
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:18.240]  model for all of us I call the crown jewels secret information of the 2000
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:23.880]  year history of the Vatican's meddling in the world's governments and working
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:27.880]  with the most evil in part the earth is ever seen second to that is the
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:31.440]  Islamic version of those files
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:36.400]  wow now let's go back to this Vatican situation we know the Vatican was
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:40.960]  involved that's open intelligence founding the euro and we know it loves
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:45.480]  to hide itself we know that now lord blackheath and others are talking about
[01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:50.280]  a foundation x richer than any government you know on earth I mean more
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:54.600]  and more stuff that was so secretive that we talked about 15 20 years ago 30
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:36:02.480]  40 years ago it's now coming out and it it all points towards an overall attack
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:08.120]  on the internet using the internet to cause such havoc that it rushes the
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:12.120]  world towards some type of collapse I mean but go briefly go back to the
[01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:16.320]  Vatican here that's that's incredible I mean specifically from insiders at
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:21.360]  WikiLeaks you're you're and you're an insider you're saying that you've been
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:26.600]  told Vatican dirt's about to come out well I'm saying that that all the world's
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:31.320]  by disease are based on the Vatican techniques and skills there they are
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:36.160]  the keeper of secrets beyond all others they are the spy beyond all that's what
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:39.840]  Hitler said he said it was the Jesuit model well but there there was stuff
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:44.200]  before the Jesuits because it's older than that so the Jesuits is almost a
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:48.240]  popular version of what they actually do so what they do and have with their
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:51.360]  files is what we want to see not the popular version that we see on novels
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:55.400]  and so forth is that we need to see the files I am a believer in documents not
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:59.560]  in fairy tales that's what we need to see the files of the national tax
[01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:07.920]  agencies not their PR yet and so in taxation the rise from the Vatican or
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:12.160]  Vatican like operations it's how you extort money from the people
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:21.400]  scaring a man offering salvation and so that's what's coming okay in order in
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:27.560]  closing in the order you went is when this is going to be coming out or is it
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:32.560]  a mix-and-match well according to WikiLeaks the next one will be a
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:37.080]  they claim they got a hard disk from a major bank some people say it's a bank of
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:41.120]  America now there's a lot of these hard disks floating around because banks use these
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:45.360]  as sting operations as does FBI so WikiLeaks is not sure they got a real one
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:49.400]  but they say they've got one and they've been trying to authenticate it and since
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:53.080]  banks are popular target now that's probably something like that will come
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:56.680]  out but don't forget they always hit us with a bombshell we didn't expect it
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:38:01.640]  could be a ploy it's possible that something will come out of say like the
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:06.680]  Clinton Foundation or something you know they're very astute taking something
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:10.880]  that will be popular all right that's why they play the ad-dye
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:17.400]  American card that's very popular outside the US John I want to get you on the
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:21.400]  Sunday show to do a full hour if we can we've had to understand this is a big
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:25.760]  syndicated show I've had to delay you twice I don't care if you use you know
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:30.800]  mild cuss words but we have to delay those out so hopefully I want to thank

[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:41.200]  you on and you can just use the the acronym you know baloney but thank you
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:45.920]  so much coming on from krypton.org amazing information there on the site
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:49.960]  and I look forward to talking to you in the near future I'm gonna have my
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:53.400]  producer calling in about five minutes to see if I can get you on for a full
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:58.200]  hour coming up Sunday to really go over the bombshells you just dropped on us
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:03.440]  thank you. Take care Alex. All right there he goes ladies and gentlemen whoa
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:10.360]  that'll make your head hurt because it makes you think it's so many things
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:15.720]  going on so many things happening for the next 25 minutes we're gonna have
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:21.320]  Donald Light he is a low-key visiting professor at Stanford University and
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:26.000]  professor of comparative health care the University of Medicine and Dentistry of
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:30.240]  New Jersey he is an economic and organizational sociologist who compares
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:35.920]  health care systems and pharmacological policy as a founding fellow of the
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:41.160]  Center for Bioethics he has become a concerned about how few new drugs are
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:45.160]  clinically much better than existing ones yet causing substantial risk to
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:49.040]  patients prescription drugs of the fourth leading cause of death from the
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:52.280]  numbers actually it could be the leading cause and result in 2.2 million
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:57.400]  hospitalizations a year professor Light is a co-author and editor of the risk of
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:02.480]  prescription drugs 2010 his research has appeared in leading medical and social
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:08.720]  science journals and I've got the book right here the risk of prescription
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:13.960]  drugs Columbia University Press Social Science Research Council series on
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:18.640]  privatization of risk and it's got the boil down here how to
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:22.800]  prescription drugs become a leading cause of death of the risk of prescription
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:26.720]  drugs and you know the numbers I've seen the news are 300,000 drug related
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:32.560]  deaths that's almost rivaling heart attack cancer and automobile accident so
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:37.880]  is it the fourth the third the second the first doesn't matter I mean it's
[01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:42.360]  it's you hear these drug ads and oh having troubled into urinate a lot well
[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:44.960]  take this down I'll give you brain cancer have a heart attack you may go
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:48.440]  insane make you suicidal blood clots and but doesn't matter call your
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:51.840]  physician if you think this is right for you because you're a doctor it's
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:54.960]  incredible so we've got him on with us for the next 25 minutes and we'll
[01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:59.600]  certainly have him back up again for a full hour in the future professor Light
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:02.920]  thank you for joining us well it's a pleasure and I've been reading about
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:06.480]  all the great things that you've been doing these wonderful documentary films
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:12.200]  and and interviews it's very impressive I'm really delighted to be talking with
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:15.680]  you well I'm delighted to have you on with us sir we've got limited times I'm
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:20.960]  trying to sit back and shut up if you were talking to a auditorium at a city
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:27.800]  council and and and you had 25 minutes to talk to them what would you say well
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:33.280]  you've you've summarized the the main finding that we had in this little book
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:38.120]  that's only the size of a five by seven photograph and only 160 pages long it
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:42.640]  was it was written for general lay audiences with short easy to read
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:49.120]  chapters and it describes as you say that that most of the new drugs are
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:56.320]  little better than existing drugs I have a table here out of the 980 drugs that
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:02.640]  were approved in the last decade only 40 were regarded as as important
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:07.200]  therapeutic advances so that's about four percent and another hundred and
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:13.800]  six were and were judged clinically to be superior to existing drugs and all
[01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:19.520]  the rest were were judged to add little little value now why is that well
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:25.360]  that's because the FDA approves drugs against placebo a placebo meaning a
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:31.800]  pill that is inert so and you don't know whether you're taking the the active
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:36.600]  new drug or the placebo and that's what is done in a clinical trial and then you
[01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:42.000]  see whether the people who took the active drug got better against some
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:48.480]  criterion that the trial is for but that means that when the FDA approves new
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:53.160]  drugs as more effective and better and and and drug companies talk about as
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:56.600]  being more effective what they really mean is more effective than an inert
[01:42:56.600 --> 01:43:02.600]  pill and in fact the FDA is prohibited from ruling whether new drugs are
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:07.320]  better than existing drugs and on the safety side they approve them as safe
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:11.800]  with very little evidence about their safety because the trials are designed
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:18.520]  to minimize evidence of safety and and and so the the actual evidence they
[01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:24.560]  have about whether these drugs are safe for you is pretty minimal well an
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:28.800]  example I would use professor is I know how to read the insert of a drug I'm
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:34.280]  on a rocket scientist but I can read it and Gardasil
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:39.040]  vaccines they admitted the trials killed quite a few people it caused auto
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:43.040]  immune responses and then of the hundreds of different papilloma viruses
[01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:48.160]  they admitted it only covered six or so and then it said this may not even stop
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:52.920]  you from getting cervical cancer and then the literature went on to admit
[01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:56.400]  that it's only killing a few thousand people a year and that's normally you
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:44:02.760]  know a treatable and so the the the benefits are far outweighed by the
[01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:07.320]  dangers but Merck just comes into Texas gives a bunch of money to the politicians
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:10.520]  and they come out and say hey little girls and now they're saying little boys
[01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:15.440]  you got to take this so you don't get you know this this cancer virus I mean I
[01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:21.600]  mean right there it's just incredible right I was told that doing the
[01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:25.720]  interview with you was like a quickly going 60 miles an hour so you're
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:31.120]  absolutely right I'm not an expert on Gardasil but you've put your finger on
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:37.280]  the new blockbuster era so the companies have have figured out that they can
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:41.400]  make vaccines or vaccine like things that they will call vaccines because the
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:46.560]  definition is being broadened for a wide number of conditions and about every
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:52.800]  half year we will see a new vaccine well for the last 25 years you can see a new
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:59.040]  vaccine very often and the prices will be about 70 dollars a dose or an often
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:02.520]  you need two or three of those that will be like two three four hundred dollars
[01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:08.520]  and you're right that they're the you know the vaccine advocates and the
[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:14.160]  companies sort of market to the public officials in the Department of Public
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:18.600]  Health or the Centers for Disease Control simply to get these things on a
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:24.960]  list so it's easy cheap marketing and then then you know then it becomes you
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:29.080]  know a part of the other of the requirements for what children should
[01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:34.480]  take and you're right that it's it's a real worry well it just builds it in
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:39.040]  that the the business model of these companies is to come lobby government to
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:42.920]  push something on you but your book I mean I mean it goes over the real
[01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:48.120]  evidence of how much harm these drugs are causing and and more and more of
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:55.400]  medicine is just here take these drugs yeah so continue going through the
[01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:59.960]  serious risk that we're looking at here okay well one thing I think it's worth
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:04.560]  saying is it is that drug companies are amongst our most enlightened and
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:10.280]  sophisticated corporations and they do a lot of serious good science and I live
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:13.840]  in an area where there are a lot of people who work for drug companies and
[01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:18.240]  there's some there are lots of wonderful employees at those companies but what I
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:22.840]  find disturbing are what must be executive decisions that are being made
[01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:29.360]  you know many layers above by the people pulling down several million
[01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:35.320]  dollars a year and salaries and bonuses above all the good staff people at at
[01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:42.480]  drug companies and and one of the main things is that they repeatedly are
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:47.720]  heavily advertising to people to take drugs for things that they were not
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:55.440]  tested for or approved in the last two years Alex drug companies have paid
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:47:03.360]  six billion dollars in fines from prosecutions by attorney generals for
[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:09.000]  illegal marketing and getting people to take drugs for reasons that are not
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:13.640]  approved this includes Johnson and Johnson Pfizer is the biggest 2.3
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:19.760]  billion dollars in fines in the last two years Eli Lilly 1.4 billion black
[01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:26.680]  so Smith Klein 400 million Sanofi Merck Eli Lilly all every one you've ever heard
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:29.680]  of Abbott and then ones that you probably haven't heard I mean that you
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:37.920]  know listeners may not have heard of all all aggressively promoting to your
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:42.160]  doctors and to all of us through advertising which by the way you know
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:46.080]  we're one of only two countries in the world that allow direct to consumer
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:51.080]  advertising because the whole idea behind prescription drugs was for 50 years
[01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:58.720]  that it was your doctor who decided whether you needed a certain drug and
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:04.160]  and it was the doctor whose job it was to stay on top of development now with
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:09.400]  direct advertising they're getting patients to go and tell the doctor what
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:17.680]  to prescribe and often for a condition that's not been tested for well I mean
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:23.160]  it just gets crazier and crazier by the minute yeah so I mean one simple thing
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:27.240]  that we recommend at the end of this little this little book which is only
[01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:31.720]  15 bucks it's I think it's the cheapest book that Columbia press has ever
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:37.360]  ever ever ever published and it was I make no money on it it was funded by the
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:43.600]  MacArthur Foundation in Chicago and they just paid us fees to do the
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:48.160]  writing that we did so we get no royalties but I just think people need
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:52.240]  to read this little book and learn about this issue and talk about it and
[01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:57.280]  protect themselves so one thing that's recommended in the last short chapter is
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:02.840]  that whenever a drug is prescribed for an unapproved use which is called off
[01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:07.200]  label but I think unapproved use really puts it on the you know on the table
[01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:13.040]  clearly is a fine content so your doctor should hand you a piece of paper might
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:17.520]  have one sentence saying I understand that this prescription is being given to
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:22.960]  me by my doctor for a condition for which it has not been approved and I
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:27.160]  agree and I mean if you know I think if most of your listeners were handed to
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:31.120]  a piece of paper like that they'd say well doctor what's going on why you're
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:36.440]  doing this I mean we see doctors that and clinics that aren't even checking to
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:40.600]  see what other medications you're on and I see even young people now with big
[01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:45.560]  you know tables just full of different pills they're taking right I mean it
[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:48.880]  and then all these weird drug interactions what are the numbers what
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:54.280]  do we know I mean how many people a year die from these drug interactions well
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:50:00.000]  the the total estimated deaths from hospitalized patients is 111,000 but as
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:04.320]  you said so well at the beginning it was a wonderful introduction you gave to
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:09.720]  this talk we don't know how many more because that doesn't count all the
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:17.400]  people who die at home at work driving walking and so forth so it's a very
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:22.600]  limited measure that we have and we and there's one of things that really
[01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:27.520]  appalls me is here is the roughly the fourth or as you say it might be the
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:33.400]  third leading cause of death and there there are relatively few tracking
[01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:37.160]  efforts to track and detail studies so when you ask well how many people die
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:42.520]  from you know drug interactions from what's called polypharmacy taking you
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:48.200]  know two three four five drugs I I can't think of a study that actually does
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:53.120]  more than just you know guess what that is so we only know about the surface of
[01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:55.320]  the tip of the iceberg stay there professor we're gonna come back
[01:50:55.320 --> 01:51:00.280]  continue to discuss this on the other side and more mock-ups coming up

[01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:11.800]  come your masters we have the video up on prisonplanet.com of Ron Paul and Fox
[01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:16.960]  business last night with Napolitano judge saying that he's been verbally told
[01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:21.600]  that he would be the new committee chairman of the key subcommittee over
[01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:26.280]  the private Federal Reserve and of course the Constitution says Congress
[01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:30.240]  will control the issuance of currency and credit the Fed has absconded with that
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:36.120]  power and here's the Bloomberg headline it's now official Ron Paul author of
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:41.160]  in the Fed to lead Fed oversight panel that was in question last week and we
[01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:44.920]  made it the number one search term to stop Boehner from blocking it and to
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:51.720]  call Boehner's office the presumptive new speaker of the House in the next
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:55.680]  Congress so representative Ron Paul Texas Republican and author of in the Fed
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:54:58.280]  will take control of the House subcommittee that oversees the Federal
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:05.720]  Reserve his son the senator elect will be joining us tomorrow Rand Paul Dr.
[01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:10.520]  Paul as well you know I'm gonna get you back because I've just read the summary
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:13.960]  of it and I read articles about your your great book but I want to get you
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:16.960]  back in the future after I read the whole book to really you know really go
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:20.280]  through it when I'm more educated but I mean it just seems that the government
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:25.680]  freaks out about a few people dying from terrorism but more people die from
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:29.440]  bee stings every year but then meanwhile you've got one of the major causes of
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:35.320]  death and I see wilder and wilder ads for drugs where it sounds like the side
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:38.960]  effects are a thousand times worse than what it's treating so I'm glad your book
[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:43.480]  is you know really trying to bring some light to this a professor light and tell
[01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:48.440]  folks where they can get the bar oh well the best places Amazon and you just
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:55.520]  put in the risk of prescription drugs my website is pharma myth dot net that's
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:56:02.920]  ph a rma myth and why THS net because I've also been looking into the claims
[01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:08.520]  by companies that it costs an average of 1.3 billion dollars in research and
[01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:13.460]  development to bring a new drug to market extremely expensive and when you
[01:56:13.460 --> 01:56:18.080]  break down the their numbers and all the numbers are created by economists who
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:23.200]  are retained by the companies it comes out to be a small fraction of that
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:28.200]  because they use all kinds of inflators to to puff the number up well I look
[01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:32.200]  forward to having you back on it for a full hour in the near future professor
[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:40.800]  give us that website one more time it's a pharma myth ph a rma my ths dot net and
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:44.720]  it's the risk of prescription drugs and I thought I'd give you one example if we
[01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:49.560]  have a minute show of a misleading ad so this is that for Lipitor about a few
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:54.040]  days ago it starts with saying did you know more than 80% of people who have
[01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:58.760]  heart attacks have high cholesterol now how is that misleading well because
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:04.440]  although it's true 90% of the people have cholesterol don't have heart attacks
[01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:08.240]  it's a different denominator if you start with all the people's heart attacks
[01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:14.400]  most of them have 10 fingers and 80% of them have cholesterol okay but if you
[01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:18.960]  start with the millions and millions who have high cholesterol very few of them
[01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:23.360]  have heart attacks and the evidence is quite clear now that taking statins to
[01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:27.920]  lower cholesterol in people who do not already have a risk of heart disease
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:34.960]  does not reduce the probability of dying it does not decrease it well now
[01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:38.880]  they want to put statins in the water have you seen those announcements yeah I
[01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:46.200]  mean I mean is big pharma just going to take over our total you know economy I
[01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:51.000]  mean it's like GMO closely allied with a big pharma basically the same same
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.960]  group you know oh we don't want you to know this is a GMO salmon that's part
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:58:00.400]  insect or part eel oh we don't want you to know this goats part insect oh we
[01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:04.080]  don't want you know that corn and studies caused all sorts of birth defects
[01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:08.520]  oh I mean just on and on and on professor great having you on look
[01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:10.760]  forward to talking to you again in the future when I've had a chance to read
[01:58:10.760 --> 01:58:15.240]  the book see you next week you bet take care all right all right buddy thank you

[02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:36.480]  you're watching us on prison planet dot TV we punched up fox news live and it
[02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:40.080]  makes no sense we've been watching it for a while this police burning down to
[02:00:40.080 --> 02:00:46.360]  california bomb home I mean what does that mean I mean if they think there's a
[02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:51.480]  bomb in there why would they burn it down instead of going in and and
[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:55.800]  defusing it or using a robot authorities have set fire to suburban
[02:00:55.800 --> 02:01:02.080]  san diego home they say was so packed with homemade explosives they had no
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:08.280]  choice but to burn it to the ground okay who knows if it's even true now I mean
[02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:13.440]  they're burning the evidence down authorities are using blow that up for
[02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:16.800]  me I can't read it across the room thanks again I'm reading it off a
[02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:20.000]  telescreen across the room here authorities are using helicopters and
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:26.360]  air pollution sensors to monitor the control burn for potential health
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:30.000]  problems the house was rented by an out-of-work software consultant who
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:33.720]  allegedly assembled an astonishing quantity of bomb making material that
[02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:38.480]  included chemicals used by Middle Eastern suicide bombers investigators are
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:41.520]  still trying to understand his motivation authorities say the fire
[02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:45.720]  should be over within a few hours well obviously it's a type of explosive they
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:50.480]  believe it gonna blow up but I mean will they show up in my house that I guess I
[02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:56.240]  might have a bag of black cats and smoke bombs left over from fourth of July I
[02:01:56.240 --> 02:02:05.280]  mean are they going to this is crazy I mean they're gonna blow my house up and
[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:09.680]  say oh there were bombs in there we had to burn it up though you know they did
[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:13.360]  that to get rid of the witnesses that the government had staged the Madrid
[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:18.000]  bombings six seven years ago and it came out that that was staged in the
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:21.600]  Spanish news and so they just went and blew up the entire apartment building
[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:24.680]  that the terrorists were supposedly in now that's how you get rid of your

[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:31.200]  cold temperatures in Cancun for the global government summit that Laura
[02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:35.440]  Chris Vermont is attending and covering and we're gonna be going to him in just
[02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:43.000]  a moment from the Yucatan Peninsula in southern Mexico here's this week news
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:48.240]  reporting irony alert the unusually chilly global warming summit in Cancun
[02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:52.600]  the reporting record low temperatures areas of Europe are reporting the coldest
[02:08:52.600 --> 02:09:00.720]  temperature since the 1560s the 1650s 1670s Mrs. Moncton the wife of the third
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:04.440]  Viscount of Brinchley and Moncton she can't get out of the house in Scotland
[02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:08.960]  for 14 days because they're snowed in I talked to Paul Watson who's over in
[02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:13.040]  England it's just the coldest in his lifetime he's seen now that doesn't mean
[02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:16.960]  the earth is necessarily getting colder every time if there's a hot summer they
[02:09:16.960 --> 02:09:20.440]  say it means we're getting warmer you have to go through long periods you have
[02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:24.560]  to study it there's always microclimates that are having extreme weather but it
[02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:28.480]  does illustrate that we know in the last 15 years the the warming trend has
[02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:35.080]  stopped and is now going down but we hope for a warming trend we hope for
[02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:38.160]  more carbon dioxide that's the science we've gone over that with Lord Moncton
[02:09:38.160 --> 02:09:44.800]  at nauseam his website scienceandpublicpolicy.org really is the
[02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:49.760]  preeminent site to really get the true research but instead of going over just
[02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:53.040]  the background I want to talk about what they're politically trying they've
[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:57.760]  shifted from saying the sky is falling warming to overpopulation Ted Turner
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:02.280]  saying get rid of people they've got TV ads running showing children being blown
[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:06.640]  up by explosives if they don't agree to cut their carbon footprint they're
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:12.160]  calling for eco fascism and in calling it fascism and saying green fascism is
[02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:15.960]  good not about the environment none of us who have children want about
[02:10:15.960 --> 02:10:20.640]  environment it's about power grabs and collectivism and Lord Moncton to give us
[02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:25.400]  a rundown for the next 50 minutes graciously I just got to his hotel out
[02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:30.120]  of a storm there with the police escorting him it's not like a tornado or
[02:10:30.120 --> 02:10:34.600]  a tempest was going on around him he's now gotten to cover and we're gonna talk
[02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:40.880]  to him via cell phone from Cancun Mexico with so much happening as a global
[02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:47.680]  freeze hits much of the planet good to have you sir well it's very good with
[02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:52.880]  you Alex I'm now actually in the security center at the cancun conference
[02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:57.760]  center I finally managed to get in and there was quite a wind blowing outside
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:03.200]  it's just to rain but it's colder than it's been since we've been in fact now
[02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:09.160]  five days they have had colder temperatures here in Cancun than have
[02:11:09.160 --> 02:11:14.280]  ever been recorded at this time of year since records began so this is very
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:18.440]  exceptional you've heard about my lovely wife Lady Moncton she has snowed up at
[02:11:18.440 --> 02:11:23.320]  home a central England temperature record showing the coldest first week of
[02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:28.880]  December since 1659 and you're quite right Alex to put in that cautionary
[02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:32.880]  note about how this doesn't mean there's no such thing as global warming or we
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:36.920]  can't be having an effect on planet what it does mean and again you're quite
[02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:41.720]  worth about this is that the rate at which this global warming is supposed
[02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:46.720]  to be occurring simply isn't happening and in fact both of the matter is but
[02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:52.560]  in the last 15 years as Professor Phil Jones of the University of East
[02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:58.600]  Anglia was recently compelled to admit when I got BBC to ask him a question
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:04.880]  about it there has been no significant global warming at all 15 years
[02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:10.760]  this is beginning to be longer periods to be all together ignored as simply a
[02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:15.480]  blit it is beginning very much to look at though exactly as the likes of me
[02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:20.800]  been saying all along we yes we may get some warming but it will be very slow
[02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:25.000]  and it will be very harmless it's not going to be a problem however the
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:30.640]  delegates here in Cancun are exactly the usual kind of robotic crowd of
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:35.240]  in-virus zombies that you would expect to find that these things and they are
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:40.640]  getting around saying the planet do that you've rightly pointed out Ted Turner is
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:45.360]  beginning to say what we've got to have is a global one-child policy and that
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:52.000]  dreadful movie made in the UK by one of these taxpayer funded pressure groups
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:56.800]  showing children being blown up and their blood spattered over their
[02:12:56.800 --> 02:13:00.960]  classmates because they had not been willing to agree with their teacher
[02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:05.360]  that global warming was the worst this problem ever that is the kind of
[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:11.840]  hysteria that you always get when those who have been peddling a lie realize
[02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:16.440]  that they're not going to be able to get away with it for very much longer and
[02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:23.680]  are you still there and one delegate recently said to my colleagues here he
[02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:27.280]  said oh yes of course my colleague up there on the rush room is talking about
[02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:31.160]  how terrible global warming is privately there he said we know perfectly
[02:13:31.160 --> 02:13:36.160]  well that it isn't but our government has told us to say this because it sees
[02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:39.680]  an advantage to itself against its taxpayers and against the people of
[02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:44.040]  the world in pretending that there is a problem so there is a growing willingness
[02:13:44.040 --> 02:13:48.640]  on the part of solid delegates here to admit that they personally don't believe
[02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:52.040]  the word of this not of course you have all the extremist groups here the
[02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:55.680]  Marxists the Greenies and the two are virtually indistinguishable in the policies
[02:13:55.680 --> 02:14:00.920]  they advocate these days they are all here in confusion every sort of weird
[02:14:00.920 --> 02:14:06.360]  organization there are gender-centered women against climate change there are
[02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:12.080]  people dressed up as polar bears all this kind of stupidity goes on but
[02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:18.720]  behind it all Alex I think those are considerable change in tone what is
[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:24.560]  beginning to happen is compared with the triumphalism of Copenhagen and Poznan
[02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:31.200]  and Bali the previous three years the annual jamborees attacks their expense
[02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:35.800]  all around the world that exotic location what we're getting here is a much
[02:14:35.800 --> 02:14:42.720]  more sullen sober even somber but people here are beginning to realize they aren't
[02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:47.600]  going to get away with this for very much longer and so contrary to the
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:51.760]  reports that you have seen in the newspaper about how nothing very much
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:58.760]  is going to happen here in Cancun the bureaucracy which is trying to turn
[02:14:58.760 --> 02:15:04.240]  itself into a world government when the world government treaty at
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:09.200]  Copenhagen was simply thrown out now they're trying to do it by stealth with
[02:15:09.200 --> 02:15:12.920]  a series of decisions at this conference which the chairman of the conference
[02:15:12.920 --> 02:15:17.720]  backing her notes on this thinks they're going to get away with creating several
[02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:23.280]  hundred new bureaucracies hundred billion dollars per year from now and
[02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:29.720]  forever from the wealthy nations of the West to be paid to the new world
[02:15:29.720 --> 02:15:34.760]  government and this will go up to one point five percent of GDP if one of the
[02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:39.400]  options on the paper is is adopted which it may well be giving this new world
[02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:43.600]  government of permanent revenue which will permanently grow as GDP grows so
[02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:48.200]  we're looking at a really ambitious power grab by the nasty people who are
[02:15:48.200 --> 02:15:53.560]  behind the scare I'm quite worried they may yet get away with it I think they
[02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:57.160]  are going to get away with most of what I've just described here and once they've
[02:15:57.160 --> 02:16:01.400]  got it if we like the EU give them the money and give them the power and then
[02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:05.440]  they become unstoppable and they'll get more money and more power until they
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:11.480]  run anything and of course not one of these people is elected by us the
[02:16:11.480 --> 02:16:15.560]  peoples of the world it is all a dictatorship which is gradually taking
[02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:20.240]  power from democratic nations and from the leaders and elected representatives
[02:16:20.240 --> 02:16:24.280]  of those nations and putting into the hands of faceless bureaucrats who we
[02:16:24.280 --> 02:16:29.400]  cannot elect cannot question cannot put to account cannot remove and cannot
[02:16:29.400 --> 02:16:34.360]  reflect okay now going back and in past years they were arrogant they were
[02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:40.200]  celebratory they they they would you have these huge parties they were the
[02:16:40.200 --> 02:16:45.640]  saviors of the earth now they're becoming a global laughing stock but as you
[02:16:45.640 --> 02:16:50.560]  said they're now burrowing down realizing their time is short everything
[02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:54.680]  that's invested in this and they're trying to get it through but last year
[02:16:54.680 --> 02:16:59.640]  you were instrumental in helping distribute the Danish text in analyzing
[02:16:59.640 --> 02:17:04.480]  the third world learned that it would basically double the amount of taxes
[02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:10.440]  that they had to pay versus the West it wasn't the freebie giveaway that it was
[02:17:10.440 --> 02:17:15.240]  a death sentence to over a billion people cutting their energy it's now
[02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:20.800]  admitted this is about shutting down industrialized societies so how are they
[02:17:20.800 --> 02:17:25.440]  trying to ram this through what is in the different texts you've been able to
[02:17:25.440 --> 02:17:30.640]  see are there any secret treaties like last time give us the end tell Lord
[02:17:30.640 --> 02:17:35.960]  Monkton what they've done this time is they've done what one of the senior
[02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:39.600]  officials here who also doesn't believe a word of this that I say that the
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:43.440]  growing kind of ripped in the loop now you could see more and more people getting
[02:17:43.440 --> 02:17:47.160]  ready to jump ship as they see it going blood blood blood down beneath the waves
[02:17:47.160 --> 02:17:51.640]  the one of them said he said what they're going for is an approach called
[02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:56.200]  parent impenetrability and what this means is that everything I've just
[02:17:56.200 --> 02:18:00.680]  described to you this extra money and the extra bureaucracies they're all listed
[02:18:00.680 --> 02:18:04.800]  they're all specified in the documents which are openly available and which
[02:18:04.800 --> 02:18:09.920]  nobody including the delegates actually reads the notes by the chair on the
[02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:14.080]  expected outcome of this conference which is one I'm basing things on because
[02:18:14.080 --> 02:18:17.200]  that's likely to be right they've been they've had several preliminary
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:22.000]  conferences first in bomb then in Tenzin in China last month to prepare for
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:25.360]  this one so they pretty well all knew where they were going when they got here
[02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:29.660]  so the chairman's note is a pretty good guide to what is actually going to
[02:18:29.660 --> 02:18:35.820]  happen but get this it's 33 pages long it's written in the most obscurantist
[02:18:35.820 --> 02:18:40.000]  obfuscatory obfuscatory of new belating style which is enough to send
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:44.880]  anybody to sleep unless you know what the code words me you've never realized
[02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:50.080]  just how much of an expansion of centralized undemocratic power this
[02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:53.880]  whole exercise is for instance let me give you an example you wanted to quote
[02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:59.000]  from me these documents they use a phrase called improving capacity building
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:03.440]  in the least developed and less well-developed countries you think
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:08.000]  that sounds wonderful so you go and you talk to a few of the UN officials who
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:12.240]  draw up this garbage and you say what does capacity building mean and it's
[02:19:12.240 --> 02:19:16.840]  nothing to do with industrial capacity or economic capacity or the capacity to
[02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:21.040]  live a civilized life or educational capacity or health capacity you know
[02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:26.280]  it's bureaucratic capacity what capacity building means in these documents is
[02:19:26.280 --> 02:19:29.640]  that they're going to be vast bureaucracies established in these
[02:19:29.640 --> 02:19:35.400]  less developed countries which will come directly under the control of our new
[02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:40.320]  masters the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
[02:19:40.320 --> 02:19:44.320]  Change that's what capacity building means it occurs all the way through the
[02:19:44.320 --> 02:19:48.120]  period it sounds wonderful when you read it you think oh I'm really doing some
[02:19:48.120 --> 02:19:52.760]  good for the third world here all they're doing is putting in bureaucracies to
[02:19:52.760 --> 02:19:57.080]  govern them got to rule them under the new neo feudalism that the environmental

[02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:14.200]  owner in the world behind the Queen of England and Dutch royalty he owns two
[02:24:14.200 --> 02:24:18.960]  million acres in the US he has five children he has more than 20 aircraft
[02:24:18.960 --> 02:24:25.000]  more than a dozen homes he flies in on his private jet and then lectures us we
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:28.520]  shouldn't take a hot shower we shouldn't have more than one child we
[02:24:28.520 --> 02:24:32.160]  shouldn't take a hot bath people all over England old people being cut off
[02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:35.720]  their gas allowance or having to ride around in buses to stay warm the
[02:24:35.720 --> 02:24:42.800]  guardian reports but there's plenty of gas and power for all the rich people in
[02:24:42.800 --> 02:24:47.160]  the US and England that stand to make money off the carbon tax I have Ward
[02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:53.160]  Monkton I heard that you've been trying to track down Mr. Eugenics Mr. Mr. Green
[02:24:53.160 --> 02:25:01.040]  Green Himmler hair hair Ted Turner yes absolutely the graph for
[02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:06.480]  212 Turner he was attending a business conference at the Ritz Carlton Hotel a
[02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:11.960]  couple of days ago here on the sandy strip at Cancun and I gatecrashed the
[02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:15.760]  conference and went around it for a bit until eventually the organizers came
[02:25:15.760 --> 02:25:20.120]  along and chased me out and they said you're not allowed in here the only
[02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:22.920]  people who are allowed into this conference are people who believe that
[02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:26.360]  global warming is the worstest possible proper ever is ever in the world and
[02:25:26.360 --> 02:25:30.360]  you're not allowed in it was sort of baby talk they use and I said but I want
[02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:34.360]  Mr. Turner I'd like to issue a challenge to him I'd like to provide some
[02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:38.080]  entertainment for delegates here by having a one-to-one debate with him in
[02:25:38.080 --> 02:25:41.960]  front of them or is he going to run away and are you going to run away he said
[02:25:41.960 --> 02:25:47.000]  no sir you're going to run away we don't want your sort here so clearly there is a
[02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:53.000]  reluctance on the part of Mr. Turner to face the amiable fear of the realm Lord
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:57.480]  Monkton on a debate about the climate and why might that be well I suspect it's
[02:25:57.480 --> 02:26:03.760]  the same reason Ted baby as Al baby when I threatened to debate him I sent a
[02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:07.880]  challenge to Al Gore he also backed off in fact he's been backing off and
[02:26:07.880 --> 02:26:12.760]  running away for nearly four years now so Ted if you're going to join the run
[02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:18.680]  join the panic join the escape then you just avoid debating with me face to
[02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:23.280]  face I'll debate with you Ted baby anywhere in the world on international
[02:26:23.280 --> 02:26:27.600]  television and we'll take any format of debate that you like as long as it's
[02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:32.280]  reasonably fair and then you and I will go head-to-head and we'll argue this
[02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:38.760]  thing out and let's see who prevails now Alex what I would advise is whatever you
[02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:44.600]  do don't hold your breath waiting for a reply from Ted Turner any more than he
[02:26:44.600 --> 02:26:48.680]  would have done if you've waited for a reply from Al Gore I'm getting to run
[02:26:48.680 --> 02:26:53.280]  out of white feathers on fire state to send to these people who are backing out
[02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:58.720]  of this debate because they know perfectly well just as the delegates here
[02:26:58.720 --> 02:27:03.040]  many of them privately are now admitting they know perfectly well but
[02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:08.720]  there is no global warming problem it is simply a chimera it is simply a device
[02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:15.120]  used by people who have other agendas which are extremely nasty here we are
[02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:21.360]  effectively trying to reinstall global fascism having just got rid of this
[02:27:21.360 --> 02:27:27.560]  Europe now here we are reinstalling global fascism in the name of saving the
[02:27:27.560 --> 02:27:32.960]  planet and as you and I know Alex the planet was triumphantly saved 2,000
[02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:39.800]  years ago and it doesn't need to be saved again expanding on that James Cameron
[02:27:39.800 --> 02:27:45.080]  issued challenges to leading global warming skeptics and then when leading
[02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:50.560]  one step forward he chickened out they will not debate it and they know deep
[02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:54.080]  down it's an excuse to have a managed takeover economy a lot of them are on
[02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:59.280]  record admitting that what percentage of the higher-ups know it's a complete
[02:27:59.280 --> 02:28:02.560]  fraud I mean I mean we know from their internal emails they know it's a fraud
[02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:07.240]  and that they've got to hide the truth but I mean what percentage of them know
[02:28:07.240 --> 02:28:11.080]  it's a fraud and then you've got the people in polar bear outfits you know
[02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:16.360]  running around I mean I see more and more of the camp followers realizing they
[02:28:16.360 --> 02:28:22.480]  were on some type of Jim Jones cult compound that's a very good description
[02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:27.200]  of this place I must say it is a very curious religion let's let's start with
[02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:32.200]  your point about whether the higher-ups know what's really going on that they
[02:28:32.200 --> 02:28:36.000]  know that there isn't a problem let me give you an example after last years
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:41.920]  Copenhagen conference one of my colleagues here Volskan Miller from the
[02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:47.320]  German division of the committee for a constructive tomorrow which I represent
[02:28:47.320 --> 02:28:53.200]  here this conference he was having that one of the two delegates official
[02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:56.840]  delegates are from Pakistan which is one of the state's parties to the
[02:28:56.840 --> 02:29:00.080]  convention and the other delegate was up on the stage speaking about how
[02:29:00.080 --> 02:29:03.080]  terrible it all was we were having floods we were having droughts and we were
[02:29:03.080 --> 02:29:06.280]  having this we were having that it was all gasping it was all because of our
[02:29:06.280 --> 02:29:11.720]  fault and quite to the other day they get said he knows and I know there's not
[02:29:11.720 --> 02:29:16.120]  a word of truth in any of that and that the home of this thing is
[02:29:16.120 --> 02:29:23.080]  nonsense but we've been told and so that's what we have to say
[02:29:23.080 --> 02:29:27.520]  Lord Monkton we've got to go to break and that's just as well because you
[02:29:27.520 --> 02:29:31.960]  just covered some key info your phone for the first time was breaking up let's
[02:29:31.960 --> 02:29:36.720]  perhaps re-establish the line or see if it clears up during the break I want you
[02:29:36.720 --> 02:29:41.080]  to come back because that takes us to the WikiLeaks cable which the State
[02:29:41.080 --> 02:29:44.520]  Department admits is real which you covered without having the secret
[02:29:44.520 --> 02:29:48.440]  documents that the US and England were in their twisting arms last year and
[02:29:48.440 --> 02:29:53.360]  promising people payoffs if they went along we're on the March the Empire's
[02:29:53.360 --> 02:29:59.800]  on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:29:59.800 --> 02:30:04.000]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:08.320]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:30:08.320 --> 02:30:12.480]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:30:12.480 --> 02:30:16.520]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:30:16.520 --> 02:30:20.400]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:30:20.400 --> 02:30:24.520]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:30:24.520 --> 02:30:28.840]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:30:28.840 --> 02:30:33.160]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:30:33.160 --> 02:30:36.880]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number

[02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:28.920]  they ought not to enjoy perhaps you'd better start from the beginning

[02:33:56.440 --> 02:34:00.480]  in the journal pediatrics these new studies suggest that the opposite that
[02:34:00.480 --> 02:34:03.800]  the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and
[02:34:03.800 --> 02:34:08.240]  mental performance fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay but could
[02:34:08.240 --> 02:34:12.920]  it also cause cancer oh yeah the government have the right under US law
[02:34:12.920 --> 02:34:17.000]  to conduct secret testing on the American public under specific conditions
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:21.440]  we have to work with dark side of the well spend time in the shadows any
[02:34:21.440 --> 02:34:26.520]  attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil well join me and
[02:34:26.520 --> 02:34:37.960]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand to say there's a need for a new world order some day in the next few years a solution
[02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:40.880]  million years
[02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:54.920]  I'm Alex Jones or Christopher Moncton joins us his website and organization is
[02:34:54.920 --> 02:35:00.800]  the leading think tank really playing out the facts of this global takeover and
[02:35:00.800 --> 02:35:07.200]  we are beginning to win battles and the war science and public policy dot org
[02:35:07.200 --> 02:35:11.600]  our sites are info wars dot com prison planet dot com and prison planet dot
[02:35:11.600 --> 02:35:16.360]  TV we are fighting the prison planet the collectivist and their elitist owners
[02:35:16.360 --> 02:35:21.000]  are see the ultra rich many of them are in a camp not liking free market they
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:24.640]  want to use government to shut everybody else down because they can't compete
[02:35:24.640 --> 02:35:29.200]  and Lord Moncton is fighting them and routing them to the ends of the earth
[02:35:29.200 --> 02:35:33.880]  and they run from him in literal fear I've seen video activists of shot it is
[02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:40.840]  as if the mild-mannered Lord is Darth Vader or something or a giant bucket of
[02:35:40.840 --> 02:35:47.200]  holy water to a vampire now I have the London Guardian report here Lord
[02:35:47.200 --> 02:35:51.320]  Moncton where they admit and the State Department admits this in his anger
[02:35:51.320 --> 02:35:55.280]  they they admit it's a real cable that other governments were all freaked out
[02:35:55.280 --> 02:36:01.120]  by the threats the bribes the promises of money the the arm twisting we see the
[02:36:01.120 --> 02:36:06.360]  United States at the center along with Gordon Brown the disgraced prime
[02:36:06.360 --> 02:36:10.040]  minister former prime minister spearheading this trying to ram it
[02:36:10.040 --> 02:36:14.840]  through on people and and you knew that at the time but but now that's all come
[02:36:14.840 --> 02:36:18.120]  out and and that was mirroring we were talking about the Pakistani minister
[02:36:18.120 --> 02:36:21.680]  who's been promised money up there spewing all this which the end of the
[02:36:21.680 --> 02:36:26.320]  world oh my gosh the West did it because they've been promised money this is now
[02:36:26.320 --> 02:36:52.520]  confirmed it just shows what incredible fraud this is
[02:36:52.520 --> 02:36:57.640]  it is of course imaginary but it is let's just pretend just for the sake of a
[02:36:57.640 --> 02:37:02.800]  game all right now we know that at this conference they are going to try to bully
[02:37:02.800 --> 02:37:08.440]  the countries of the West who are all too eager most of them to comply to hand
[02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:15.880]  over a hundred billion dollars of Western taxpayers money to the UN of course the
[02:37:15.880 --> 02:37:19.600]  name of the game is this is supposed to go to third world countries to help them
[02:37:19.600 --> 02:37:24.400]  to adapt to the consequences of the terrible global warming that we in the
[02:37:24.400 --> 02:37:30.720]  West have caused by our emissions of carbon dioxide but let's just pretend for
[02:37:30.720 --> 02:37:35.880]  a moment that they're right a hundred billion dollars a year is a trillion
[02:37:35.880 --> 02:37:40.880]  dollars under is a trillion dollars every ten years now the thing is this but
[02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:48.560]  in order to forestall just one Celsius degree of warming if the US government
[02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:52.760]  was right in its figures for how much the Waxman Marquis bill would cost which
[02:37:52.760 --> 02:37:57.280]  have a fairly typical lot of range of measures like cap and trade and regulations
[02:37:57.280 --> 02:38:01.760]  on him to them all that kind of thing then you would need to spend a hundred
[02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:12.560]  billion dollars a year for 340 years in order to forestall just one Celsius
[02:38:12.560 --> 02:38:17.400]  degree of warming that Al Gore says is going to make all the coastal cities
[02:38:17.400 --> 02:38:24.440]  disappear within seven years so 300 year solution to a seven-year problem that
[02:38:24.440 --> 02:38:29.200]  that's right and not only that but if you wanted to forestall all three point
[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:35.920]  four degrees Celsius which is about six Fahrenheit of warming which the UN says
[02:38:35.920 --> 02:38:41.760]  might happen on the globe by 2,100 in the next hundred years then it would
[02:38:41.760 --> 02:38:47.800]  be two one thousand years of spending a hundred billion dollar rates just to make
[02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:53.640]  that tiny amount of temperature change not happen so there's a huge mismatch
[02:38:53.640 --> 02:39:00.160]  between what these people are trying to argue for here and what they could
[02:39:00.160 --> 02:39:05.280]  possibly achieve and curiously until I recently did these calculations nobody
[02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:09.760]  anywhere in the world had sat down and worked out and said okay the thing we
[02:39:09.760 --> 02:39:14.480]  spend all this money how much global warming will we actually forestall it's
[02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:17.720]  all been done on the basis of the code we spend the money maybe it will make a
[02:39:17.720 --> 02:39:21.520]  contribution nobody had worked out that in fact it makes a practical no
[02:39:21.520 --> 02:39:27.040]  difference at all so even if there were a problem as big as these nitwits here
[02:39:27.040 --> 02:39:31.200]  that there is the fact is that all the spending that they are planning to make
[02:39:31.200 --> 02:39:35.760]  and it's critically expensive spending would not make anything like enough
[02:39:35.760 --> 02:39:41.720]  difference even to begin to create the problem and this leads to the idea that if
[02:39:41.720 --> 02:39:46.280]  there were to be any problems arising from warmer weather and frankly if you
[02:39:46.280 --> 02:39:50.120]  find any global warming send a summer in Scotland my lovely wife could do it
[02:39:50.120 --> 02:39:56.560]  very badly then if there really were what we would simply do is to say look we'd
[02:39:56.560 --> 02:40:01.320]  be better off adapting to the warmer weather and its consequences in a
[02:40:01.320 --> 02:40:07.240]  focused way as and only where and only when necessary rather than squander it
[02:40:07.240 --> 02:40:14.360]  will be billions and trillions now on what is entirely futile exercise Lord
[02:40:14.360 --> 02:40:17.840]  Monkton you got cut off by the break earlier you were trying to tell the
[02:40:17.840 --> 02:40:22.480]  story of the Pakistani minister telling you that the other Pakistani
[02:40:22.480 --> 02:40:27.040]  minister was just saying it because they've been promised money that's now
[02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:32.560]  confirmed by the cables that the secret arm twisting was going on recapped that
[02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:35.440]  because your phone was breaking up at that time
[02:40:35.440 --> 02:40:39.520]  yeah certainly this in fact I think I mistakenly said this was in Copenhagen
[02:40:39.520 --> 02:40:43.960]  last year in fact it was bombed this year after which one of my colleagues
[02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:48.800]  a boss who is from the committee for a constructive tomorrow which I also belong
[02:40:48.800 --> 02:40:51.360]  to it's an environmental group that believes in looking after the
[02:40:51.360 --> 02:40:56.000]  environment rather than worrying about global warming and we're here under
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:41:01.880]  their eaches he was sitting next to one of the two Pakistani delegates at the
[02:41:01.880 --> 02:41:06.640]  discussions in bond which were leading up to this conference here in Cancun and
[02:41:06.640 --> 02:41:10.400]  is the other delegate was up on the platform speaking and say who is all
[02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:14.160]  terrible where do unless we shut down the economy to the west all this kind of
[02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:18.600]  rubbish and his colleague was sitting talking to us gangbulla not really
[02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:21.800]  realizing that we were on the other side of the base and saying to be both
[02:41:21.800 --> 02:41:27.480]  actually none of us believe a word of this nonsense but our government told
[02:41:27.480 --> 02:41:32.600]  us to say it and of course we've seen this time and time again before
[02:41:32.600 --> 02:41:37.560]  government spinning in vehicles into changing their view and becoming alarmist
[02:41:37.560 --> 02:41:42.000]  India has just decided it's going to change its view and start accepting
[02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:47.160]  compulsory caps on the amount of carbon dioxide it emits and it's doing this
[02:41:47.160 --> 02:41:52.920]  but almost certainly because tumbling is a very large sum of pride to do that we
[02:41:52.920 --> 02:41:58.120]  had it in Russia where the Russian Academy of Sciences got a report from
[02:41:58.120 --> 02:42:06.240]  a doctor Andre Ilarionov who was one of its key scientists in 2004 saying look
[02:42:06.240 --> 02:42:10.880]  we've had a conference at which we invited skeptics and we invited the
[02:42:10.880 --> 02:42:13.840]  British government to send its chief scientist to tell us why there was a
[02:42:13.840 --> 02:42:17.240]  problem we have the skeptics as well and the chief scientist on really liking
[02:42:17.240 --> 02:42:21.680]  the skeptics were there walked out he couldn't answer our questions so Ilarionov
[02:42:21.680 --> 02:42:25.160]  then made an impassioned speech saying that Sir Sir David King who was then the
[02:42:25.160 --> 02:42:30.520]  chief scientist had let down the name of Britain let down the name of Sir and had
[02:42:30.520 --> 02:42:34.160]  certainly convinced him that there was no problem at all with global warming
[02:42:34.160 --> 02:42:38.800]  because King was trying to say the exact opposite so then six months later
[02:42:38.800 --> 02:42:44.920]  Tony Blair went to see a gas pewter the new Tower of all the books at that time
[02:42:44.920 --> 02:42:48.800]  and said to him look if you want to get entry into the world trade
[02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:54.160]  organization on highly favorable terms we want you to shut Dr Ilarionov and the
[02:42:54.160 --> 02:42:58.480]  Russian Academy of Sciences up get them to change their view and become a true
[02:42:58.480 --> 02:43:01.720]  believer in the new religion of global war because that way all of us in the
[02:43:01.720 --> 02:43:07.400]  governing class can and I'm going to use a rogue word here can screw the ordinary
[02:43:07.400 --> 02:43:12.360]  people of the world and of course Julie Putin changed his mind ordered the
[02:43:12.360 --> 02:43:17.080]  Russian Academy to do the same and these are the very nasty little games that
[02:43:17.080 --> 02:43:20.800]  are being played but of course the more they play these games the more they get
[02:43:20.800 --> 02:43:24.960]  caught out because you know the great thing about bureaucracy is that most of
[02:43:24.960 --> 02:43:28.880]  the people who are in these bureaucracies are actually good people they're trying to
[02:43:28.880 --> 02:43:33.000]  do a decent job they can see that the maniacs who are in charge of the asylum
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:37.520]  are dishonest and corrupt and so they then leak info one of them has the
[02:43:37.520 --> 02:43:41.120]  courage to stand up and say so and that's how we get the WikiLeaks that's how we
[02:43:41.120 --> 02:43:44.800]  get the time it gave emails that's how we get the story from the Pakistan
[02:43:44.800 --> 02:43:50.200]  Minister that's how I got Andrea Ilarionov to tell me personally what I just told you
[02:43:50.200 --> 02:43:53.960]  unbelievable he were told directly by the head of the Russian Academy of
[02:43:53.960 --> 02:43:58.720]  Sciences that this went on that is a huge news story in and of itself showing
[02:43:58.720 --> 02:44:03.600]  how they do this by hook and by crook now shifting gears we know these people
[02:44:03.600 --> 02:44:08.680]  love to play the part of savor of the earth they're also control freaks the
[02:44:08.680 --> 02:44:13.360]  White House science are agrees with Ted Turner and writings that he wants to
[02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:18.000]  sterilize us with chemicals in the water and he wants one child policies he's
[02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:22.040]  also told the Associated Press in the first press conference he gave almost
[02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:28.440]  two years ago that he wants to geo engineer the planet to save us from
[02:44:28.440 --> 02:44:32.520]  environmental degradation and we know Bill Gates who's pushing this has bought
[02:44:32.520 --> 02:44:37.960]  the patents for it so another way they want to taxes is for the world having
[02:44:37.960 --> 02:44:43.080]  to pay them to quote save us from the global warming then they get to play
[02:44:43.080 --> 02:44:49.000]  the part of like Superman a savior of the world from Lex Luthor the boogie man
[02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:54.720]  bizarro and the rest of Superman's enemies we have an activist post article
[02:44:54.720 --> 02:45:01.680]  you and climate concern morphs into Kim trail glee club and I've got all the
[02:45:01.680 --> 02:45:05.320]  different articles here where they're hopping around at the meeting trying to
[02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:09.920]  get rid of the UN treaty on geo engineering from decades ago so what
[02:45:09.920 --> 02:45:15.560]  else I mean we cover the other official documents where they call for force
[02:45:15.560 --> 02:45:20.680]  relocating populations I mean what types of bizarre craziness are you
[02:45:20.680 --> 02:45:25.440]  hearing from these people well because they are talking of force relocations
[02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:30.800]  because of the imagined sea level rise which also incidentally isn't happening
[02:45:30.800 --> 02:45:35.400]  sea level is rising at around eight inches to one foot per century as it has
[02:45:35.400 --> 02:45:39.000]  done as best we can work it out for the last century and a half before that the
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:43.680]  records aren't too good but we can tell from ice cores and geological records
[02:45:43.680 --> 02:45:49.040]  that over the last eleven thousand four hundred years sea level has risen by
[02:45:49.040 --> 02:45:54.120]  more than four hundred feet that's close to four feet per century now we're down
[02:45:54.120 --> 02:45:59.560]  to less than one foot per century I'm not very terrified are you so yes they
[02:45:59.560 --> 02:46:04.440]  then propose all these monstrous geo engineering programs putting giant
[02:46:04.440 --> 02:46:08.920]  umbrellas made of aluminum up between us and the sun in outer space and every
[02:46:08.920 --> 02:46:12.640]  time a meteorite come along it punches a hole and tears the thing apart they're
[02:46:12.640 --> 02:46:17.120]  thinking of using in fact putting more pollution back into the atmosphere
[02:46:17.120 --> 02:46:20.560]  because the pollution stops the sun getting through and cools down the
[02:46:20.560 --> 02:46:24.480]  planet just one problem with that they had overestimated the amount of cooling
[02:46:24.480 --> 02:46:28.960]  caused by that kind of pollution and the figures were corrected last year by a
[02:46:28.960 --> 02:46:34.760]  paper by Gunnar Mairi which is about to yet again change all the science because
[02:46:34.760 --> 02:46:39.200]  it means that the warming effect of CO2 paradoxically is a lot less than the
[02:46:39.200 --> 02:46:43.720]  UN had formerly thought so we're getting all these people advocating more and
[02:46:43.720 --> 02:46:48.560]  more extreme absurd and above all expensive solution more and also of
[02:46:48.560 --> 02:46:52.840]  course very immoral solution you know the idea of saying to people you could
[02:46:52.840 --> 02:46:58.840]  only have one child because we face that is outrageous what they should be doing
[02:46:58.840 --> 02:47:02.920]  but of course they won't do because they don't want to share their riches is to
[02:47:02.920 --> 02:47:08.200]  make the poor people of the world richer because as populations become more
[02:47:08.200 --> 02:47:13.120]  prosperous and they come up above the poverty line then their rate of breathing
[02:47:13.120 --> 02:47:17.960]  slows down all by itself you don't have to have abortion you don't have to have
[02:47:17.960 --> 02:47:21.580]  artificial contraception you don't have to have Chinese soldiers we've come
[02:47:21.580 --> 02:47:25.400]  shooting one of the two twins if a mother is unlucky enough to have twins
[02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:29.880]  none of that needs to happen all you have to do is make people more prosperous
[02:47:29.880 --> 02:47:34.080]  that's the kind of geoengineering that the committee for a constructive
[02:47:34.080 --> 02:47:38.360]  tomorrow is in favor of and so is the science of public policy institute we
[02:47:38.360 --> 02:47:43.560]  visited just yesterday a village only 10 miles from where I'm standing in the
[02:47:43.560 --> 02:47:49.440]  conference hall and that village had no electricity no sanitation no water no
[02:47:49.440 --> 02:47:54.400]  school until a Catholic charity came and gave it one and no health care they
[02:47:54.400 --> 02:47:58.800]  have absolutely nothing except each other and the Mexican government is
[02:47:58.800 --> 02:48:03.240]  spending all this money on air returning conferences while its own people are
[02:48:03.240 --> 02:48:08.560]  starving because they don't have basic amenities like electricity that's the
[02:48:08.560 --> 02:48:13.560]  kind of geoengineering I want to see electricity to everyone clean water and
[02:48:13.560 --> 02:48:18.520]  safe sewage disposal for everyone Lord Monty and everyone health care for
[02:48:18.520 --> 02:48:22.320]  everyone that's the kind of geoengineering I want to see but you
[02:48:22.320 --> 02:48:25.840]  won't hear much of that among the lunatics of this conference here in
[02:48:25.840 --> 02:48:29.480]  Cancun and I hope you're getting the flavor Alex but I'm becoming very
[02:48:29.480 --> 02:48:34.720]  angry at this unwillingness of the world's governing class to listen to the
[02:48:34.720 --> 02:48:38.640]  needs of ordinary people around the world it's bad enough that they spit in
[02:48:38.640 --> 02:48:42.440]  the face of democracy and try and take it away it's bad enough that our freedom
[02:48:42.440 --> 02:48:46.200]  and our money are being taken away but that they also kick the poor in the
[02:48:46.200 --> 02:48:50.560]  teeth while pretending to help them that seems to me to be something for they
[02:48:50.560 --> 02:48:55.240]  ought to try for a very long time somewhere uncomfortable after this life
[02:48:55.240 --> 02:48:59.680]  is not in it well that was my next point I mean Ted Turner all of them just
[02:48:59.680 --> 02:49:05.400]  write books give speeches dripping with venom hating the third world but even
[02:49:05.400 --> 02:49:09.800]  the Royal Commission in 49 and England found if the third world was
[02:49:09.800 --> 02:49:14.280]  industrialized they would get a negative population growth just like has
[02:49:14.280 --> 02:49:18.200]  happened in Japan Italy England the United States not only does it
[02:49:18.200 --> 02:49:23.620]  stabilize for every two adults man and woman they start having one point three
[02:49:23.620 --> 02:49:30.800]  one point four children that the West is actually dying and the UN admits the
[02:49:30.800 --> 02:49:37.040]  third world's gonna stabilize 2020 at about 8 billion 200 million so they
[02:49:37.040 --> 02:49:42.800]  they know they know by deindustrializing the first world by freezing
[02:49:42.800 --> 02:49:47.240]  industrialization in the developing world that it's a death sentence and it
[02:49:47.240 --> 02:49:51.960]  will hurt the environment they don't care they want to control everything they
[02:49:51.960 --> 02:49:57.600]  are villains your comment well I'm afraid you're understating it Alex and I
[02:49:57.600 --> 02:50:01.920]  don't often say this to you but really I am so angry with these people because of
[02:50:01.920 --> 02:50:08.160]  that utter lack of concern lack of thought and lack of the use of reason
[02:50:08.160 --> 02:50:14.120]  what is it that differentiates us from all the other creatures in the visible
[02:50:14.120 --> 02:50:20.680]  creation it is that we have the ability to use reason and the entire governing
[02:50:20.680 --> 02:50:24.360]  class of the world certainly that part of it which has assembled in large
[02:50:24.360 --> 02:50:29.680]  numbers here in Cancun they are all as though they are in a limiting asylum as
[02:50:29.680 --> 02:50:35.800]  though they are simply totally unable to use their minds at all and of course
[02:50:35.800 --> 02:50:41.000]  this is because they know increasingly they know that this whole climate rubbish
[02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:46.240]  is nonsense but what they're doing is they are exploiting it they are
[02:50:46.240 --> 02:50:51.520]  profiting by it they're making billions out of it and they're making billions at
[02:50:51.520 --> 02:50:57.760]  half expense and worse of all at the expense of the third world they stay
[02:50:57.760 --> 02:51:00.800]  there stay there final segment we're gonna talk about how we stop these
[02:51:00.800 --> 02:51:04.160]  monsters is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or
[02:51:04.160 --> 02:51:08.400]  attorneys 18 years ago we developed a program that has made thousands debt
[02:51:08.400 --> 02:51:13.120]  free in just 90 days it's called zero debt in 90 days and it works for all
[02:51:13.120 --> 02:51:17.080]  credit card debt medical bills even collection lawsuits when I first joins
[02:51:17.080 --> 02:51:22.200]  I was being sued so I use the program methods and after filing one piece of
[02:51:22.200 --> 02:51:26.200]  paper the collection lawsuit was dismissed with zero debt in 90 days your
[02:51:26.200 --> 02:51:30.320]  success is guaranteed in writing there is no other program of its kind don't be
[02:51:30.320 --> 02:51:33.680]  alone with creditors gang up on you let our team of experts provide the
[02:51:33.680 --> 02:51:37.600]  resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days guaranteed

[02:51:58.360 --> 02:52:04.240]  debt guarantee dot com the question is where should the American people draw
[02:52:04.240 --> 02:52:10.280]  their line in the sand what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic is
[02:52:10.280 --> 02:52:14.320]  based on a constitution which protects minority rights not democracy not mob
[02:52:14.320 --> 02:52:17.920]  rule two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own
[02:52:17.920 --> 02:52:22.880]  our land they think they're on our water children our education our money we
[02:52:22.880 --> 02:52:27.960]  have to define who we are and what we will tolerate somebody's gonna ask you
[02:52:27.960 --> 02:52:33.160]  what you did during the patriot uprising we have the facts we have the
[02:52:33.160 --> 02:52:37.040]  constitution we have the bill of rights we have common law knowledge is power

[02:52:40.760 --> 02:52:45.200]  me rise of the republic tyranny is upon us but liberty and the sleeping giant that
[02:52:45.200 --> 02:52:49.440]  is the American people is rising a new tool in the info war don't tread on me

[02:53:33.360 --> 02:53:37.040]  investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs they've been available since
[02:53:37.040 --> 02:53:41.200]  1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your
[02:53:41.200 --> 02:53:45.520]  retirement gold is outperform paper investments yet no word about IRAs if
[02:53:45.520 --> 02:53:50.720]  you would like to have gold for your retirement call 800 686 2237 don't get
[02:53:50.720 --> 02:53:56.600]  left behind by rising inflation in low returns call 800 686 2237 secure your
[02:53:56.600 --> 02:54:05.920]  future and call 1-800-686-2237
[02:54:05.920 --> 02:54:11.160]  yeah there's a woman in the night starving to death and it's well documented
[02:54:11.160 --> 02:54:16.520]  these carbon cuts of energy will kill over a billion people in the next decade
[02:54:16.520 --> 02:54:20.600]  we're going back to Lord Christopher Monk to talk about how we stopped these
[02:54:20.600 --> 02:54:24.400]  people and hopefully in the next few weeks or after Christmas we can get him
[02:54:24.400 --> 02:54:29.280]  on to talk about briefly the aftermath of this criminal consortium meeting down
[02:54:29.280 --> 02:54:34.320]  in Cancun they're routed but they're dangerous and they're still taking over
[02:54:34.320 --> 02:54:37.720]  our societies at the local level before we go back to Lord Monkton
[02:54:37.720 --> 02:54:42.880]  Silver's way up Gold's way up Midas Resources bought the silver and gold
[02:54:42.880 --> 02:54:46.280]  when it was lower they're selling it to you when it's higher at the old low
[02:54:46.280 --> 02:54:50.320]  price but Ted is running out of those silver dollars and silver half dollars
[02:54:50.320 --> 02:54:53.960]  and the Franks and sovereigns at the lower price you've got to tell them it's
[02:54:53.960 --> 02:54:58.240]  the radio special I don't have time to get into all of it give them a call get
[02:54:58.240 --> 02:55:08.600]  into silver and gold today 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 my job's easy I promote
[02:55:08.600 --> 02:55:12.520]  what I believe in I've been telling you buy gold and silver for over a decade
[02:55:12.520 --> 02:55:17.560]  when silver was five dollars an ounce when gold was 260 bucks an ounce did I
[02:55:17.560 --> 02:55:23.840]  secure you right get into silver and gold today 800 686 2237 tell them it's the
[02:55:23.840 --> 02:55:27.480]  Alex Jones special to get the lower prices the regular prices are great we
[02:55:27.480 --> 02:55:30.760]  got about four minutes left Lord Monkton down there at the conference any
[02:55:30.760 --> 02:55:35.320]  other observations how do we stop these people what's the time frame on when
[02:55:35.320 --> 02:55:41.480]  we'll know if they were successful at this Larson's meeting right the in the
[02:55:41.480 --> 02:55:46.040]  next two days we should hear whether or not they've come to the agreement I
[02:55:46.040 --> 02:55:49.400]  expect them to come to and I've outlined the main points of that huge
[02:55:49.400 --> 02:55:53.720]  expanse of bureaucracy huge expansion of taxation of the West by the UN huge
[02:55:53.720 --> 02:55:59.840]  growth in the secretariat of the UN framework convention which now has its
[02:55:59.840 --> 02:56:03.400]  own army it had its own troops effectively you see them now wherever you
[02:56:03.400 --> 02:56:09.320]  go these UN security people who are pretty nasty types either they're all
[02:56:09.320 --> 02:56:13.940]  ex-merceries as far as I can see you know this is growing into a kind of super
[02:56:13.940 --> 02:56:19.360]  state which exists wherever it decides to land and hold a conference the
[02:56:19.360 --> 02:56:25.440]  way we stop it I think is by the US and one or two other leading countries once
[02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:29.000]  we have a Republican president again who stopped taking interest in standing up
[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:32.840]  for the US rather than trying to destroy it I hope you'll forgive me if I say
[02:56:32.840 --> 02:56:37.720]  that about your president but it is very sad to see what he's been doing he's
[02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:43.840]  not our president he he's a total globalist miscrant but go ahead well
[02:56:43.840 --> 02:56:47.200]  so what I'm saying is I think that what we now need to do is for America needs
[02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:53.080]  to leave the UN leave the UN framework framework convention on climate change
[02:56:53.080 --> 02:56:59.600]  leave the IPCC on the ground that they are all fraudulent corrupt and unduly
[02:56:59.600 --> 02:57:05.000]  expensive and that American taxpayers can no longer be trusted to the can no
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:09.520]  longer have the money taken from them and the UN be trusted suspended I think
[02:57:09.520 --> 02:57:13.280]  we've got to take that all the way leave it we've got to found a new
[02:57:13.280 --> 02:57:17.920]  organization called the United Democracies in which only democratic
[02:57:17.920 --> 02:57:21.640]  countries will be allowed to participate and the only people who will be allowed
[02:57:21.640 --> 02:57:27.080]  to speak for various nations at the United Democracies and its meetings
[02:57:27.080 --> 02:57:32.120]  will be people who we the people of the democratic world have elected to
[02:57:32.120 --> 02:57:36.880]  represent us because one of the big dangers that has the supranational
[02:57:36.880 --> 02:57:42.680]  organizations like this grim secretive secretariat of the UN's UN framework
[02:57:42.680 --> 02:57:48.560]  convention the danger is not one of these supranational cross-border powerful
[02:57:48.560 --> 02:57:55.120]  ever better funded organizations is democratically elected so every time
[02:57:55.120 --> 02:57:59.640]  we pass power from us to them we're passing power from elected hands to
[02:57:59.640 --> 02:58:03.800]  unelected hands that must stop article one section one of your
[02:58:03.800 --> 02:58:08.320]  constitution gives all legislative power to the elected Congress nobody else can
[02:58:08.320 --> 02:58:14.640]  make laws or impose taxes on America let that be the rule at an international
[02:58:14.640 --> 02:58:19.440]  level as well absolutely Lord Moncton taxation without representation you
[02:58:19.440 --> 02:58:23.560]  know legislation without representation you've been very gracious hopefully you
[02:58:23.560 --> 02:58:27.440]  can join us right before Christmas in the aftermath or after Christmas or in
[02:58:27.440 --> 02:58:31.400]  the new year to let us know what happened we're blessed to have you there and I
[02:58:31.400 --> 02:58:35.560]  really appreciate you spending time with us so good luck down there be safe real
[02:58:35.560 --> 02:58:39.400]  pleasure and complex America all right God bless you back live tomorrow with
[02:58:39.400 --> 02:59:07.160]  ramble
