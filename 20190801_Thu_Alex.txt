[00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:24.068]  It's Thursday, August 1st, 2019.
[00:00:24.068 --> 00:00:38.877]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from the InfoWars.com news studios in Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide and transmitting over the internet in defiance of George Soros, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and the NWO.
[00:00:40.632 --> 00:01:08.912]  Well, if you're a TV viewer, you can see behind me there, on the big screens, what is officially being put out nationwide by the Antifa organization that is publicly funded by the Democratic Party and George Soros, refusedfascism.org, the same folks that did the full page ads around the country saying, overthrow the government, drive Trump regime from power, November 4th it begins.
[00:01:10.558 --> 00:01:11.018]  Remember that?
[00:01:11.018 --> 00:01:13.460]  A couple years ago?
[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:26.750]  Well now, they're organizing the violent attack on border control facilities in Texas and in the graphics that they have, it shows American flags burning.
[00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.332]  We can show the full graphic on screen, that'd be great.
[00:01:29.332 --> 00:01:38.819]  American flags burning, burning ICE vehicles and dead ICE officers with arrows sticking out of them,
[00:01:39.853 --> 00:01:50.620]  In pools of blood, Molotov cocktails being thrown and burning down the ICE facility.
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.641]  And we'll just go document cam then.
[00:01:52.641 --> 00:01:54.843]  Document cam shot please.
[00:01:54.843 --> 00:01:56.624]  Border Resistance Tour.
[00:01:56.624 --> 00:02:00.006]  And we'll put this full screen on TV, this graphic in there.
[00:02:00.006 --> 00:02:01.247]  Border Resistance Tour.
[00:02:02.267 --> 00:02:17.331]  You can see the ICE people dead here in pools of blood, the burning vehicles, and the Moloff cocktails being thrown into the concentration camp-looking facility with the American flag on fire.
[00:02:17.331 --> 00:02:26.194]  And then there's also a Liberation Theology nativist symbol being promoted by the Ford Foundation for Native Peoples to Uprise and Kill All White People.
[00:02:26.194 --> 00:02:29.395]  That symbol is then seen shining over the
[00:02:30.652 --> 00:02:33.693]  Embattlements in the parapets.
[00:02:33.693 --> 00:02:40.374]  So, we've got a big article on that going up at InfoWars.com in the next 30 minutes that Kit Daniels is working on.
[00:02:40.374 --> 00:02:44.375]  He first reported on this last week when Antifa announced plans to attack the facilities.
[00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:45.416]  Now RedState's reporting on it.
[00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:51.717]  Antifa says it's coming to Texas on September 1st.
[00:02:51.717 --> 00:02:55.598]  And that they are organizing on the hashtag that we'll be covering coming up next segment.
[00:02:56.687 --> 00:02:59.288]  Hashtag meet me in Texas.
[00:02:59.288 --> 00:03:09.774]  And of course they're praising the man a few weeks ago that firebombed the ICE facilities in Washington State and was shot at police officers before he was killed.
[00:03:09.774 --> 00:03:11.655]  I am Antifa.
[00:03:11.655 --> 00:03:15.937]  He wrote his Antifa manifesto and said it is now time to uprise nationwide.
[00:03:15.937 --> 00:03:17.498]  Kill, kill, kill.
[00:03:17.498 --> 00:03:20.780]  He said don't think, just start killing law enforcement.
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.782]  So, and none of the AOC Four Horsemen will say it's wrong.
[00:03:27.782 --> 00:03:30.542]  They've all been asked in press conferences.
[00:03:30.542 --> 00:03:33.863]  CNN and others have praised Antifa as a good group.
[00:03:33.863 --> 00:03:42.365]  So, we're going to be breaking all of that down coming up here on the broadcast today.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.142]  And how it ties into flood of illegal migrants.
[00:03:48.142 --> 00:03:51.383]  They're not illegal aliens, they're migrants to the border.
[00:03:51.383 --> 00:03:55.505]  Outpaced this last two years with 1.1 million expected in fiscal year 2019.
[00:03:55.505 --> 00:04:00.588]  And it ties into deter migrants.
[00:04:00.588 --> 00:04:05.711]  Trump administration pushes elaborate scaffolding at the border and off the books.
[00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:10.313]  ICE let loose 218,000 migrant family members into the US since December.
[00:04:10.313 --> 00:04:13.855]  And of course, they're only catching about a third of the people we have seen our border
[00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:25.944]  Broken, but if you zoom right in on here, you can see again the bloody dead ICE agents in the pools of blood and the peace movement throwing them all off cocktail.
[00:04:25.944 --> 00:04:30.707]  And again, everything that the Soros funded group does.
[00:04:32.518 --> 00:04:36.919]  Everything they engage in, refuse fascism, is meant to look real simple and black and white.
[00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:45.421]  It's all completely centralized and run by the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundation, with funding from George Soros.
[00:04:45.421 --> 00:04:48.462]  So it is the muscle of the meth-head left.
[00:04:48.462 --> 00:04:52.062]  We'll cover this and so much more on the other side of Alex Jones.
[00:04:52.062 --> 00:04:53.403]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news day.
[00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:04.402]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[00:05:04.402 --> 00:05:05.463]  They are technocrats.
[00:05:05.463 --> 00:05:07.766]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:14.635]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[00:05:15.196 --> 00:05:16.976]  We're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[00:05:16.976 --> 00:05:19.457]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[00:05:19.457 --> 00:05:25.938]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[00:05:25.938 --> 00:05:31.119]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warsandlife.com, I couldn't do it.
[00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:40.141]  That's why we decided to take our original secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical modelment and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[00:05:41.121 --> 00:05:47.108]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[00:05:47.108 --> 00:05:48.049]  It is amazing.
[00:05:48.049 --> 00:05:58.060]  Experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American Revolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:16.493]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:34.392 --> 00:06:38.516]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this August 1st, Thursday Global.
[00:06:38.516 --> 00:06:40.277]  Incredibly important transmission.
[00:06:40.277 --> 00:06:42.439]  Don't forget, it's not just Alex Jones.
[00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:48.044]  It's truly this year, from 11am to 3pm, everyday central time, we have the David Knight Show.
[00:06:48.044 --> 00:06:54.970]  Going out of my old studio, the old classic studio, but now he's moved into there, weekday mornings, at 8am central.
[00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.133]  And then Owen Schreyer, right after us with The War Room.
[00:06:58.133 --> 00:07:01.796]  And I'm about a year behind, but now in the next month or so, you'll see several new shows.
[00:07:04.098 --> 00:07:14.627]  Okay, if you're a radio listener, you might want to go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com the next 30 minutes.
[00:07:14.627 --> 00:07:19.512]  We're going to have an article up about this with screenshots and links to all the documentation.
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:25.503]  But if you are a TV viewer, you can see all of this behind me.
[00:07:25.503 --> 00:07:35.129]  This is being officially put out by Antifa, funded by the Ford, Carnegie, Rockefeller Foundation, and of course, George Soros.
[00:07:35.129 --> 00:07:39.632]  All of their artwork is always meant to look childish and grassroots.
[00:07:39.632 --> 00:07:46.756]  It's always black and white, and it's run out of the Communist Party offices at refusefascism.org.
[00:07:48.297 --> 00:07:55.905]  And the leader of it, again, is an avowed supporter of Obama, and of the Weathermen, and of all of these people.
[00:07:55.905 --> 00:07:57.426]  And he routinely goes on The Young Turks.
[00:07:58.786 --> 00:07:59.746]  He was just on the Young Turks.
[00:07:59.746 --> 00:08:01.367]  In fact, let's pull that up.
[00:08:01.367 --> 00:08:03.288]  Leader of Antifa was on the Young Turks.
[00:08:03.288 --> 00:08:03.968]  I forget his name.
[00:08:03.968 --> 00:08:04.949]  It was like a rat.
[00:08:04.949 --> 00:08:05.529]  White guy.
[00:08:05.529 --> 00:08:07.009]  Old white commie.
[00:08:07.009 --> 00:08:11.611]  And he says, well, we're about to have a violent overthrow.
[00:08:11.611 --> 00:08:24.697]  But in the double think of these people, it shows individuals with peace signs on them, throwing Molotov cocktails and burning up ice agents and ice agents laying around in pools of blood.
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:30.501]  And remember, they bought full-page ads in the Washington Post and the New York Times over the last few years, repeatedly.
[00:08:30.501 --> 00:08:31.782]  This nightmare must end.
[00:08:31.782 --> 00:08:33.962]  The Trump-Pence regime must go.
[00:08:33.962 --> 00:08:35.022]  November 4th, it begins.
[00:08:35.022 --> 00:08:35.503]  Be there.
[00:08:35.503 --> 00:08:37.803]  Join with thousands.
[00:08:37.803 --> 00:08:41.784]  People gather in cities and towns across the country.
[00:08:41.784 --> 00:08:48.466]  A move of protests that continue every day and night, growing until we become millions, determined not to stop until the regime is driven from power.
[00:08:50.313 --> 00:08:58.300]  And, well, now they're not just saying go to Refuse Fascism, now they're saying go to their new website, borderresistance.com.
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:02.084]  We'll put that site up on screen for you.
[00:09:02.084 --> 00:09:12.774]  And they say that they're going to be meeting starting in the last few days in Santa Cruz, Oakland, August 1st, Olympia, Washington, where they firebomb a facility.
[00:09:14.747 --> 00:09:16.969]  August 2nd, Portland, Oregon.
[00:09:16.969 --> 00:09:18.670]  August 4th, Seattle.
[00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:20.491]  August 6th, Minneapolis.
[00:09:20.491 --> 00:09:21.632]  August 7th, Chicago.
[00:09:21.632 --> 00:09:28.217]  And then they're all going to caravan down from Chicago, down I-35, and they're going to firebomb.
[00:09:28.217 --> 00:09:29.738]  This is on their main site.
[00:09:29.738 --> 00:09:42.387]  They're going to firebomb ICE facilities, shoot police officers in the back, and shoot people full of arrows, and burn American flags, which they're already doing across the country.
[00:09:42.387 --> 00:09:43.328]  So, there you go.
[00:09:44.028 --> 00:09:49.472]  Because they believe they're fighting Nazis, that they're Captain America fighting Red Skull.
[00:09:49.472 --> 00:10:00.079]  Except they wear Nazi uniforms, are funded by a former Nazi collaborator, George Soros, and attack free speech, and throw them all off cocktails and shoot people.
[00:10:00.079 --> 00:10:02.781]  That was an antifa person that went and shot Scalise.
[00:10:02.781 --> 00:10:04.522]  He identified with them as well.
[00:10:04.522 --> 00:10:05.403]  At the baseball game.
[00:10:05.403 --> 00:10:09.626]  So, they're getting ready to make their move.
[00:10:09.626 --> 00:10:09.746]  And...
[00:10:11.414 --> 00:10:13.776]  They are a domestic terror organization.
[00:10:13.776 --> 00:10:20.842]  The definition of terrorism is to threaten violence or carry out violence for a political or economic end.
[00:10:20.842 --> 00:10:23.764]  And this is the very definition of it.
[00:10:23.764 --> 00:10:24.785]  I've been attacked by them.
[00:10:24.785 --> 00:10:26.466]  Owens had them point guns at him in Austin.
[00:10:26.466 --> 00:10:28.628]  The police did nothing because it's a blue city.
[00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:29.288]  They were upset.
[00:10:29.288 --> 00:10:34.192]  The police didn't like it, but they said, we've been ordered to stand down by the new police chief.
[00:10:34.192 --> 00:10:39.737]  And they pointed guns and said, you're not going to the park for your Control the Borders demonstration.
[00:10:40.851 --> 00:10:46.813]  And they, I mean, Owens was within his rights to obviously physically take him out, but he didn't.
[00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:49.754]  But that's the level that this has gotten to.
[00:10:49.754 --> 00:11:00.018]  And just remember, remember, as Antifa says, it's coming to Texas, that we got these documents a year and a half ago in January of 08.
[00:11:00.018 --> 00:11:03.159]  Documents that tell plan for civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore.
[00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:08.982]  Obama, through the Justice Department, it's in Antifa's own documents, with Alexander Soros in command.
[00:11:08.982 --> 00:11:09.622]  You can read this.
[00:11:10.481 --> 00:11:23.803]  Working with the Baltimore police to allow Antifa, white college professors and government employees to burn buildings, attack police, to try to get the black population to uprise.
[00:11:25.029 --> 00:11:32.473]  So that's the view that they have of black people, is that they're mindless idiots that can be programmed and made to do what they want.
[00:11:32.473 --> 00:11:33.854]  But they failed.
[00:11:33.854 --> 00:11:36.635]  They got some rioting, but not as much as they wanted.
[00:11:36.635 --> 00:11:37.636]  They didn't get it nationwide.
[00:11:37.636 --> 00:11:42.438]  That's why CNN was on every channel saying, well, you know, police deserve to die.
[00:11:42.438 --> 00:11:49.922]  When a bunch of cops got shot in Dallas and a bunch of cops got shot in Louisiana, they said, well, police are doing bad things, so people are pushing back.
[00:11:49.922 --> 00:11:50.783]  In almost every case,
[00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:56.854]  It was where somebody pulled a gun on the police and the media would lie about it, but the truth would later come out.
[00:11:56.854 --> 00:12:03.156]  This was all meant to stir up a violent revolution to keep Obama in office, but it failed.
[00:12:03.156 --> 00:12:09.478]  And I believe this will fail as well, but it's the same tactic by Soros and the UN in Europe.
[00:12:09.478 --> 00:12:14.100]  Turkey threatens to open the front gates to migrants entering Europe.
[00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:23.448]  Now Erdogan said years ago, if you don't let me organize an Islamic party in all of your countries, I will overthrow you with migrants.
[00:12:23.448 --> 00:12:28.894]  So they capitulated to him and now he's even sending more in, millions and millions.
[00:12:28.894 --> 00:12:31.256]  And he has an alliance with the left.
[00:12:31.256 --> 00:12:34.520]  And so now Turkey Interior Minister has threatened to open the floodgates.
[00:12:35.851 --> 00:12:36.992]  to mass migration to Europe.
[00:12:36.992 --> 00:12:42.156]  And see, the more you take, then the more those outside groups can now parlay that into power.
[00:12:42.156 --> 00:12:48.562]  Warning, no European government will be able to survive for more than six months.
[00:12:48.562 --> 00:13:02.674]  Back in March of 2016, the EU agreed to allow Turkish citizens visa-free travel to European Union and began a pathway for Turkey to join the EU in return for them stemming the flow of migrants into Europe.
[00:13:02.674 --> 00:13:03.175]  But they didn't.
[00:13:03.993 --> 00:13:09.278]  However, the UUU has failed to deliver on the promise, and Turkey says they're going to break their promise.
[00:13:09.278 --> 00:13:13.401]  But the truth is, this has all been part of the larger plan, the weaponization.
[00:13:13.401 --> 00:13:28.835]  But don't forget, you've got lots of mentally ill people, like the man who firebombed the ICE facility who wrote the Antifa manifesto, a total and complete kookball, who believed he was fighting Nazis.
[00:13:28.835 --> 00:13:29.976]  In his manifesto, he says,
[00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:33.932]  Don't think, just start killing.
[00:13:49.246 --> 00:13:52.687]  Pairing masses of people like they did the Arab Spring.
[00:13:52.687 --> 00:13:54.888]  Man who firebomb government buildings belonged to.
[00:13:54.888 --> 00:13:57.229]  Armed Antifa group promoted by CNN.
[00:13:57.229 --> 00:14:04.111]  They even had a fundraiser on CNN for his organization that he was a commander of.
[00:14:04.111 --> 00:14:05.071]  Heavily praised.
[00:14:05.071 --> 00:14:16.475]  And you look at the videos of him and when he was talking to the three percenters, like in this photo of ten folks on that talked to him, he was completely delusional and believed he was fighting Red Skull.
[00:14:16.475 --> 00:14:18.676]  When there's anything close to Red Skull, it's the New World Order.
[00:14:21.016 --> 00:14:23.117]  Oh, we love bringing in the Muslims of the Arab Springs.
[00:14:23.117 --> 00:14:27.778]  They can kill all the gay people and throw women into slave pens.
[00:14:27.778 --> 00:14:29.638]  None of it makes sense.
[00:14:29.638 --> 00:14:30.558]  None of it's reality-based.
[00:14:30.558 --> 00:14:33.819]  Like, people with peace symbols throwing Maalouf cocktails.
[00:14:33.819 --> 00:14:37.700]  They're like, oh, well, this is just, you know, some drawing.
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.621]  All of it's done psychological warfare style.
[00:14:41.621 --> 00:14:42.501]  Very, very skillfully.
[00:14:42.501 --> 00:14:44.542]  In fact, I even know the artist.
[00:14:44.542 --> 00:14:48.363]  I have a piece of their art hanging on the wall from the WTO protest in 1999.
[00:14:50.405 --> 00:15:06.672]  And I know the whole organization, the whole group, we've infiltrated them in Berkeley, we've infiltrated them in Austin, and you have board members of the University of Texas, people that chair departments, who literally are Chinese agents of Chinese intelligence who command them.
[00:15:06.672 --> 00:15:08.513]  Now I told you that two years ago.
[00:15:08.513 --> 00:15:16.916]  A year later, it was in the Washington Post that UT Confucius Center shut down because it was run by Chinese intelligence.
[00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:18.357]  That was even in mainstream news!
[00:15:19.653 --> 00:15:22.134]  You cannot make up how dangerous these people are.
[00:15:22.134 --> 00:15:31.838]  That's why they all have, I'm serious, most of them either wear shirts or have tattoos of Mao Tse-Tung.
[00:15:31.838 --> 00:15:36.060]  There it is on screen, Daily Text, and you team must cut ties with Confucius Institutes.
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.502]  Is it found they are Chinese intelligence?
[00:15:39.502 --> 00:15:40.142]  Ha!
[00:15:40.142 --> 00:15:42.843]  Yeah, the Russians, they're really infiltrating us.
[00:15:42.843 --> 00:15:46.665]  Russia can't even control its gigantic country three times the size of the US.
[00:15:47.887 --> 00:15:49.628]  No, China is the one that needs resources.
[00:15:49.628 --> 00:15:52.070]  It's China that's taking over the planet.
[00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.472]  It's China that owns the day.
[00:15:53.472 --> 00:15:55.053]  It's China we're in a trade war with.
[00:15:55.053 --> 00:15:55.473]  China!
[00:15:55.473 --> 00:15:55.653]  China!
[00:15:55.653 --> 00:15:56.114]  China!
[00:15:56.114 --> 00:15:59.897]  And they run Antifa!

[00:17:28.863 --> 00:17:30.104]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:17:30.104 --> 00:17:34.005]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:17:34.005 --> 00:17:35.546]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:17:35.546 --> 00:17:38.047]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:17:38.487 --> 00:17:44.049]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[00:17:44.049 --> 00:17:45.250]  I can help you, too.
[00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.191]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[00:17:48.191 --> 00:17:50.412]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[00:17:50.412 --> 00:17:54.854]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[00:17:54.854 --> 00:18:01.256]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[00:18:01.256 --> 00:18:07.419]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[00:18:08.649 --> 00:18:12.913]  This is a digital AI-enforced gag order.
[00:18:12.913 --> 00:18:16.636]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[00:18:22.301 --> 00:18:24.002]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[00:18:24.002 --> 00:18:25.222]  This is racketeering.
[00:18:25.222 --> 00:18:26.343]  This is cartels.
[00:18:26.343 --> 00:18:28.764]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[00:18:28.764 --> 00:18:30.625]  We need it now.
[00:18:30.625 --> 00:18:32.326]  You can take on Big Tech.
[00:18:32.326 --> 00:18:41.270]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:49.313]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[00:18:49.313 --> 00:18:50.174]  The way to fight back
[00:18:50.814 --> 00:18:55.657]  ...is to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[00:18:55.657 --> 00:19:00.260]  Understand that if they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:00.941]  David Knight here.

[00:19:28.355 --> 00:19:31.936]  So make sure you join us every Monday through Friday again, 9 a.m.
[00:19:31.936 --> 00:19:33.537]  Eastern, 8 a.m.
[00:19:33.537 --> 00:19:34.097]  Central Time.

[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.301]  Eastern, 8 a.m.
[00:19:47.301 --> 00:19:47.821]  Central Time.
[00:19:48.041 --> 00:20:03.319]  Again, don't forget to tune in to The David Knight Show on InfoWars.com forward slash David dash Knight dash show.
[00:20:03.319 --> 00:20:05.923]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:38.792 --> 00:20:41.453]  Look at those headlines, and they're real!
[00:20:41.453 --> 00:20:45.596]  Antifa publicly organizing terror attacks on ICE facilities in Texas.
[00:20:45.596 --> 00:20:51.079]  That's the new article of all the screenshots and documentation, and Kit's adding even more information to it.
[00:20:51.079 --> 00:20:56.201]  And the live video feed is titled, Antifa Announces Nationwide Uprising.
[00:20:56.201 --> 00:20:58.883]  Bloody terror attacks, publicly planned.
[00:20:59.972 --> 00:21:13.836]  In Texas, and just two and a half weeks ago, they hit a nice facility in Washington, torching multiple cars, firing at police, and Antifa across the nation officially called for more death.
[00:21:13.836 --> 00:21:19.738]  And the words of their manifesto writer, stop thinking, start killing!
[00:21:19.738 --> 00:21:20.218]  So liberal.
[00:21:22.136 --> 00:21:46.469]  In the flyers they're putting out, and this is the official Antifa artist that does this, on their site, funded by George Soros, commanded by Alexander Soros, that's public, they buy full-page ads in the New York Times, by the group, same group, people in peace symbols throwing Molotov cocktails and burning up ICE agents, ICE agents in pools of blood, burning American flag.
[00:21:48.195 --> 00:21:52.162]  And across the country, American flags pulled down the last few years, the last few weeks.
[00:21:52.162 --> 00:21:58.512]  Mexican flags hoisted up, Antifa publicly organizing terror attacks on ICE facilities in Texas.
[00:21:59.551 --> 00:22:08.039]  And there are big Native American movements at these universities being taught to kill the white man in South Texas, and those groups are represented here as well.
[00:22:08.039 --> 00:22:20.151]  And they say that they are going to occupy the facilities, that they are going to burn them to the ground, that they are going to kill, just like their leader, their new martyr.
[00:22:23.049 --> 00:22:25.929]  Willem van Spronsen said to do.
[00:22:25.929 --> 00:22:27.330]  Stop thinking.
[00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:28.350]  Get your guns illegally.
[00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:29.590]  These are quotes.
[00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:34.391]  Start killing.
[00:22:34.391 --> 00:22:35.331]  Promotion shows U.S.
[00:22:35.331 --> 00:22:36.711]  flag on fire.
[00:22:36.711 --> 00:22:37.671]  Dead ICE agents.
[00:22:37.671 --> 00:22:52.314]  And again, I'm going to explain this for the 50 millionth time because I know you know it, but this article, when we published this last January, a year and seven months ago, all hell broke loose behind the scenes because we were sent
[00:22:53.547 --> 00:23:07.442]  By a family member, whose brother got in a lot of trouble, so they went to his house and found that he was a commander, an officer, in Antifa, and funded by Friends of Democracy, Final Operation Order Summary.
[00:23:09.349 --> 00:23:11.052]  And this is the targets they're allowed to hit.
[00:23:11.052 --> 00:23:12.794]  They have deals with McDonald's.
[00:23:12.794 --> 00:23:13.796]  They have deals with Starbucks.
[00:23:13.796 --> 00:23:17.882]  You know, Starbucks asks you if you're white, if you're a bad person.
[00:23:17.882 --> 00:23:19.144]  They teach Black Lives Matter.
[00:23:19.144 --> 00:23:21.227]  They teach that police are bad.
[00:23:21.227 --> 00:23:24.531]  Well, they have a deal with them where they're allowed to knock out their windows and burn them.
[00:23:26.018 --> 00:23:29.481]  That's why they don't get arrested, because they have deals with certain blue city police.
[00:23:29.481 --> 00:23:30.001]  That's all in there.
[00:23:30.001 --> 00:23:33.264]  This was from Baltimore four and a half years ago.
[00:23:33.264 --> 00:23:34.726]  It's a blueprint to everything.
[00:23:34.726 --> 00:23:37.808]  And they say, you will go to this juncture point here at this time.
[00:23:37.808 --> 00:23:40.911]  You will smash these windows and set fire to this.
[00:23:40.911 --> 00:23:41.792]  You've been authorized.
[00:23:41.792 --> 00:23:44.614]  There will be a captain there controlling the police.
[00:23:44.614 --> 00:23:46.516]  So the captains are Antifa.
[00:23:46.516 --> 00:23:48.057]  This is so diabolical.
[00:23:48.057 --> 00:23:49.078]  You talk about organized crime.
[00:23:49.078 --> 00:23:51.140]  It's like the mayor of Portland is Antifa.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.262]  Many of the police in places like Portland actually help Antifa.
[00:23:56.262 --> 00:23:57.223]  Many are Antifa.
[00:23:57.223 --> 00:24:00.446]  Some aren't, but they're driven out of the departments.
[00:24:00.446 --> 00:24:03.348]  That's why Eric Holder wanted to federalize police.
[00:24:03.348 --> 00:24:12.996]  That's why they kept hyping up these deals with the feds to come in and take over local departments, because they're supposed to have racism, because they were going to have their people in charge everywhere.
[00:24:12.996 --> 00:24:16.399]  And then once they have the police, you've got a police state.
[00:24:16.399 --> 00:24:18.721]  Once authoritarians, be they communist or fascist,
[00:24:19.687 --> 00:24:24.509]  Just like Venezuela right now, or Cuba, or North Korea, Katie barred the door.
[00:24:24.509 --> 00:24:27.010]  Then you have to go to a shooting war.
[00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:35.113]  Well, they've been killing cops and doing all this to put pressure on them the last few years under Obama to capitulate.
[00:24:35.113 --> 00:24:41.916]  It says agitators will inform operations when AOEC has approved the final distribution of funds.
[00:24:41.916 --> 00:24:47.679]  Considering OPSET, it just goes through military terms, the information will be conveyed after the action.
[00:24:48.464 --> 00:24:57.968]  Related through the same communications channels, using Negotiate Ops, and it goes through all the other systems and their contacts in the police department.
[00:24:57.968 --> 00:24:59.669]  You want to go read this.
[00:24:59.669 --> 00:25:02.410]  They all sign off on the battle action.
[00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:03.691]  They have the legal forms.
[00:25:03.691 --> 00:25:06.912]  They have the lawyer standing by.
[00:25:06.912 --> 00:25:10.634]  They have insurance if they get hurt.
[00:25:10.634 --> 00:25:15.096]  Their job, agitate the black population into uprising.
[00:25:18.086 --> 00:25:19.728]  Where are they going to attack?
[00:25:19.728 --> 00:25:20.870]  What targets are they going to hit?
[00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:31.904]  It turned out Eric Holder was funding the entire Trayvon Martin, George Zimmerman debacle.
[00:25:31.904 --> 00:25:34.268]  All the made-for-TV movies and all the things they do.
[00:25:36.186 --> 00:25:38.187]  We commend the Lizards for getting this to us.
[00:25:38.187 --> 00:25:48.612]  And if you have antifa in your family, your husband, your wife, your sister, your brother, your neighbor, your country needs you to legally and lawfully get those documents and get them to us or Project Veritas.
[00:25:48.612 --> 00:25:51.193]  And send them to showtips at InfoWars.com.
[00:25:51.193 --> 00:25:56.876]  And if you don't see a response right away because we get so many emails, sometimes I hit the spam filter, physically mail it to us.
[00:25:56.876 --> 00:25:59.477]  Call into the office, get it to us.
[00:25:59.477 --> 00:26:02.039]  I know over the years we've missed a lot of stuff, that's why I say
[00:26:03.112 --> 00:26:04.433]  Send it to Project Veritas.
[00:26:04.433 --> 00:26:06.214]  Send it to The Daily Caller.
[00:26:06.214 --> 00:26:07.274]  Send it to Red State.
[00:26:07.274 --> 00:26:11.116]  But just see it to everybody.
[00:26:11.116 --> 00:26:22.623]  Turns out, federal marshals and then state police years ago sent secret documents about how they were being trained that veterans and gun owners were the number one terror threat.
[00:26:22.623 --> 00:26:24.023]  No one would publish it but us.
[00:26:24.023 --> 00:26:24.664]  We published it.
[00:26:24.664 --> 00:26:25.224]  It was real.
[00:26:25.224 --> 00:26:31.547]  The government had to admit, yes, Obama's teaching police that Christians and gun owners are terrorists and that veterans are bad people.
[00:26:31.547 --> 00:26:32.048]  It's all lies.
[00:26:32.895 --> 00:26:35.135]  The FBI Director is out putting that lie out right now as well.
[00:26:35.135 --> 00:26:39.996]  This is part of their cover for what they're doing, the uprising they're trying to form.
[00:26:39.996 --> 00:26:47.057]  They've got people inside the FBI, inside the ATF, inside everything, and they've been trying this for a long-term plan.
[00:26:47.057 --> 00:27:01.640]  But the article, Documents Detail Plan for Civil Unrest in Martial Law in Baltimore, as soon as this live show is done today, I'm going to archive on our own servers this breakdown I've done in the last 30 minutes, and we're going to post it
[00:27:03.345 --> 00:27:07.527]  into this original article and repost it on the front page of InfoWars.com.
[00:27:07.527 --> 00:27:10.769]  But right now, it is a maximum alert.
[00:27:10.769 --> 00:27:16.131]  Antifa publicly organizing terror attacks on ICE facilities in Texas.
[00:27:16.131 --> 00:27:17.172]  Promotion shows U.S.
[00:27:17.172 --> 00:27:21.234]  flag on fire, dead ICE agents in pools of blood.
[00:27:21.234 --> 00:27:27.316]  They say we're going to launch a, quote, 10-day siege in El Paso, Texas, starting September 1st.
[00:27:27.316 --> 00:27:29.838]  And they say that they are preparing with their border resistance
[00:27:30.791 --> 00:27:31.712]  We're good to go.
[00:27:54.565 --> 00:27:56.066]  Trump has said designate them as a terror group.
[00:27:56.066 --> 00:28:11.498]  Can you think if I was up here organizing and people in a group I had had already firebombed and already attacked people with metal bars and concrete and quikrete and all the crap we've seen, you know how fast I'd be arrested for conspiracy to commit crimes?
[00:28:11.498 --> 00:28:14.380]  Conspiracy to violate people's civil rights to be able to demonstrate?
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:17.803]  That's what they go out and do is violate people's rights to demonstrate?
[00:28:17.803 --> 00:28:21.386]  I would be arrested within a week, and I should be.
[00:28:21.386 --> 00:28:23.707]  But not them, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:23.707 --> 00:28:24.008]  Not them.
[00:28:25.182 --> 00:28:32.689]  They get to organize criminal activity and overthrow of the elected government in the full page ads of the New York Times.
[00:28:32.689 --> 00:28:35.871]  George Soros gets that money, by the way, from the State Department.
[00:28:35.871 --> 00:28:40.856]  And Trump still hasn't been able to turn it off because it was already allotted under Obama.
[00:28:40.856 --> 00:28:41.556]  That's how that works.
[00:28:41.556 --> 00:28:43.518]  Some of these things are done two, three, five years out.
[00:28:43.518 --> 00:28:45.520]  Now a lot of the money is running out.
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:51.325]  The couple billion bucks they had to run fake media and anti-Alex Jones stuff, that money ran out a few months ago.
[00:28:51.325 --> 00:28:52.086]  Do you notice what happened?
[00:28:53.561 --> 00:28:57.392]  We are outlasting these murderers, but they're getting ready to launch some big ops.
[00:28:59.292 --> 00:29:03.854]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[00:29:03.854 --> 00:29:05.935]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[00:29:05.935 --> 00:29:07.676]  I had a problem like you once.
[00:29:07.676 --> 00:29:14.219]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[00:29:14.219 --> 00:29:19.302]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[00:29:19.302 --> 00:29:24.004]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[00:29:24.444 --> 00:29:27.545]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[00:29:27.545 --> 00:29:34.568]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[00:29:34.568 --> 00:29:39.751]  And if you have PPO private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[00:29:39.751 --> 00:29:43.052]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[00:29:43.052 --> 00:29:43.992]  Get clean.
[00:29:43.992 --> 00:29:45.833]  Call now and learn more.
[00:29:45.833 --> 00:29:45.873]  800-506-6740.
[00:29:49.855 --> 00:29:50.336]  800-506-6740 That's 800-506-6740
[00:30:00.487 --> 00:30:11.715]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists are backed into a corner, and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[00:30:11.715 --> 00:30:15.838]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[00:30:15.838 --> 00:30:25.205]  The world is going to change, and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails.
[00:30:25.945 --> 00:30:27.967]  The system is vulnerable.
[00:30:27.967 --> 00:30:30.650]  Electricity could be gone in an instant.
[00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:34.274]  And grocery stores could be empty in three days.
[00:30:34.274 --> 00:30:41.182]  Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the next level.
[00:30:41.182 --> 00:30:46.527]  And being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a dying system.
[00:30:47.128 --> 00:30:52.357]  Buy storable foods and an Alexa Pure Gravity Water Filter today.

[00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:08.454]  Before I started working at InfoWars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and InfoWars.com, but also the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:08.454 --> 00:31:15.817]  And there's one product that's offered at InfoWarsStore.com that is the elite of the supplements, and that's DNA Force Plus.
[00:31:15.817 --> 00:31:19.339]  Now, I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests.
[00:31:19.739 --> 00:31:23.581]  Tellomeres and telomere support with your DNA.
[00:31:23.581 --> 00:31:32.024]  So I started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres.
[00:31:32.024 --> 00:31:35.445]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus but it's expensive.
[00:31:35.445 --> 00:31:35.766]  Why?
[00:31:35.766 --> 00:31:38.547]  Because it is an elite supplement.
[00:31:38.547 --> 00:31:43.689]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support.
[00:31:44.249 --> 00:31:48.872]  And they came and they went, but DNA Force Plus is still there.
[00:31:48.872 --> 00:31:50.553]  It is the elite supplement.
[00:31:50.553 --> 00:31:54.215]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive.
[00:31:54.215 --> 00:32:00.058]  So you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at Infowarsstore.com.

[00:33:03.346 --> 00:33:11.553]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:11.553 --> 00:33:16.637]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:21.656 --> 00:33:24.378]  The last Democrat president.
[00:33:24.378 --> 00:33:27.560]  Let's look into Obama the way they've looked at me from day one.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:31.402]  They've looked into everything that we've done.
[00:33:31.402 --> 00:33:34.804]  They could look into the book deal that President Obama made.
[00:33:34.804 --> 00:33:36.625]  Let's subpoena all of his records.
[00:33:36.625 --> 00:33:46.192]  Let's subpoena all of the records having to do with Hillary Clinton and all of the nonsense that went on with Clinton and her foundation and everything else.
[00:33:46.192 --> 00:33:47.552]  We could do that all day long.
[00:33:47.552 --> 00:33:49.534]  Frankly, the Republicans were gentlemen.
[00:33:50.214 --> 00:33:50.854]  And women.
[00:33:50.854 --> 00:33:57.018]  When we had the majority in the House, they didn't do subpoenas all day long.
[00:33:57.018 --> 00:33:59.259]  They didn't do what these people have done.
[00:33:59.259 --> 00:34:00.600]  What they're doing is a disgrace.
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:01.960]  So destructive to our country.
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:11.625]  So, full page ads in the New York Times that cost $150,000 apiece, paid for by George Soros' son.
[00:34:21.707 --> 00:34:32.275]  And now they're running new ads calling for fire bombings of ICE facilities and they're coming with an army to attack.
[00:34:32.275 --> 00:34:33.816]  I'm going to get more into that.
[00:34:33.816 --> 00:34:39.360]  The articles are up on Infowars.com.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:47.587]  But notice we were all told that today we were going to see the declassification of all the memos on Russiagate and all the Comey crap.
[00:34:48.683 --> 00:34:54.126]  And I said last week, I said, you watch, Bill Barr is going to block that.
[00:34:54.126 --> 00:34:58.329]  Because he's there to cover their butts.
[00:34:58.329 --> 00:35:05.053]  He's there to try to get them to stop coming after Trump so they can make a deal, but the Democrats aren't holding up their end of the bargain, are they?
[00:35:05.053 --> 00:35:08.936]  To kiss and make up and play patty cakes.
[00:35:08.936 --> 00:35:13.299]  And so now a federal judge had said today, even if Barr didn't release it, that the federal judge was.
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:18.301]  Oh, and now the federal judges backed it off another month.
[00:35:18.301 --> 00:35:28.443]  FBI agents went to Comey's home, we learned, to retrieve a secret memo after his termination.
[00:35:28.443 --> 00:35:34.225]  So there's been a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes that we're all just learning about.
[00:35:37.227 --> 00:35:52.591]  We're going to get to all of that and the huge China developments, the economy developments, the debates last night, several guests coming up, and so much more today.
[00:35:52.591 --> 00:35:57.833]  But first I want to raise this point of the New York Times.
[00:35:57.833 --> 00:36:05.375]  I want to raise this point.
[00:36:05.375 --> 00:36:05.795]  How much
[00:36:07.881 --> 00:36:08.501]  Does it cost?
[00:36:08.501 --> 00:36:13.902]  The New York Times says, on average, a full-page ad is $150,000.
[00:36:13.902 --> 00:36:21.424]  Now that could be just on average, but in the front section, it's more.
[00:36:21.424 --> 00:36:24.244]  Now they ran a lot of these ads, not just in the New York Times.
[00:36:24.244 --> 00:36:35.867]  Now this was paid for by George Soros' son, the main funder of Refuse Fascism, whose leader runs it nationwide and has gone on, just this last month, the Young Turks program, the Young Turks,
[00:36:36.846 --> 00:36:39.107]  And said the violent overthrow is coming.
[00:36:39.107 --> 00:36:44.310]  So has basically everybody.
[00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:45.090]  You've heard the Democrats.
[00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:46.691]  We need a violent revolution.
[00:36:46.691 --> 00:36:48.151]  Any means necessary.
[00:36:48.151 --> 00:36:52.033]  Joe Biden said physical revolution.
[00:36:52.033 --> 00:36:53.834]  So that's where they're going.
[00:36:53.834 --> 00:36:55.415]  And the reason that's important is $150,000 for that ad.
[00:36:59.744 --> 00:37:02.685]  See, I'm trying to raise $300,000, $400,000.
[00:37:02.685 --> 00:37:11.866]  And to do that, I've got to sell a million dollars worth of product because you are used to getting the products at 30, 40, 50% off.
[00:37:11.866 --> 00:37:18.268]  So now, if I don't have sales all the time, we don't sell the product.
[00:37:18.268 --> 00:37:19.728]  And then we make 20% or so.
[00:37:19.728 --> 00:37:23.989]  Some of these deals are so good, we make less.
[00:37:23.989 --> 00:37:24.829]  And I'm not complaining.
[00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:28.790]  It's just the fact that then we sell a million dollars worth of product over two or three days.
[00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:33.593]  I think we've sold, what are we up to, like $600,000?
[00:37:33.593 --> 00:37:42.861]  Can we go to Infowars.com forward slash show guys and look at the counter there, look at the gas gauge on this attempt to fuel up the operation?
[00:37:42.861 --> 00:37:45.864]  Yeah, $700,000.
[00:37:45.864 --> 00:37:48.827]  Which is wonderful, but then you realize that's probably $150,000 of quote profit.
[00:37:52.642 --> 00:38:21.536]  To try to have extra money, just a little bit of extra money, to launch some new shows and to have some other initiatives that obviously with our de-platforming, I'm not going to tell you some of the well-known successful groups and organizations that are able to expand and in the face of all this censorship, despite the fact that they've all been demonetized and they've all been basically shut down, that we've been able to go out and get other people to begin to set up some systems of capital
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:27.162]  So that they can continue to operate or expand.
[00:38:27.162 --> 00:38:28.662]  And I see that really as my responsibility.
[00:38:28.662 --> 00:38:36.365]  It's not just making InfoWars bigger and stronger, but to go out and really empower others that have shown that they can do a great job.
[00:38:36.365 --> 00:38:41.848]  And so about half of what we do is public.
[00:38:41.848 --> 00:38:43.668]  But there's a lot of other stuff you don't know about.
[00:38:43.668 --> 00:38:50.651]  And I've been really frustrated in that I've not been able the last year to put
[00:38:52.972 --> 00:38:56.634]  Five million dollars into other people's projects.
[00:38:56.634 --> 00:39:03.057]  I've only been able to put half a million dollars in other people's projects.
[00:39:03.057 --> 00:39:14.082]  And we've got the sweetest, juiciest projects that I know are just going to be dynamite in the information war that, quite frankly, I need like five million dollars.
[00:39:14.082 --> 00:39:20.725]  Because, used to, I'd have an extra couple million dollars and I would go out, some years five million, and I'd spend it.
[00:39:21.556 --> 00:39:38.700]  I would give it to basically almost every prominent name you know, usually off record, but other little fledgling groups, organizations, plane tickets, hotels, RVs, insurance, security, websites, books, films, and we've been good stewards with your money.
[00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:44.421]  And look, I got a nice house and I got a nice car, but I've got the $60,000 truck or whatever.
[00:39:44.421 --> 00:39:45.721]  I don't need the million dollar Lamborghini.
[00:39:47.228 --> 00:40:08.683]  I care about defeating the globalists and so I see money as fuel or as ammunition and I've got enemy soldiers coming at us and literally you're like a stork that flies over and drops provisions in on us here so we can keep fighting or dropping in a new machine gun barrel for us if you want to use a military analogy or drop medicine in for us.
[00:40:08.683 --> 00:40:14.467]  It's like video games where you know you're about to die and you get another life and used to let's take a Galaga
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:20.082]  Analogy, a great 1980s video game where you're a spaceship.
[00:40:20.082 --> 00:40:22.103]  And you know, sometimes I was really good at it when I was a kid.
[00:40:22.103 --> 00:40:24.784]  I'd get up to like five spaceships.
[00:40:24.784 --> 00:40:29.026]  And I'd get to where I got so good, I'd basically almost beat the game a few times, I would just quit.
[00:40:29.026 --> 00:40:30.466]  I never had time.
[00:40:30.466 --> 00:40:35.949]  I was never a huge video game guy, but on a few things like that, I think I did win Galaga once or something.
[00:40:35.949 --> 00:40:42.652]  The point is, is that by the time I was like 11 or 12, I'm like, why am I playing Donkey Kong three hours a day?
[00:40:42.652 --> 00:40:43.412]  I'm gonna stop this too.
[00:40:46.271 --> 00:40:51.992]  But see, I'm down to one ship, basically.
[00:40:51.992 --> 00:41:10.937]  And if they blow up this ship, then all the other little ships out there that we've helped spawn and support and push, and you know, some of those people that we helped build up and promote and push, they won't even help me or even talk to me now.
[00:41:10.937 --> 00:41:11.417]  That's okay.
[00:41:12.378 --> 00:41:26.932]  They are doing good work, even if they're doing it for their own selfish purposes, or if they're missing the gene that tries to build up other people and other things, or they're just scared because they don't want to be associated with me because the establishment comes after you if you are.
[00:41:26.932 --> 00:41:28.614]  They're just not leaders.
[00:41:28.614 --> 00:41:30.516]  They've still done great jobs.
[00:41:33.251 --> 00:41:39.634]  You know, every time James O'Keefe comes on, he gets about a hundred phone calls threatening him not to ever come on here again, and they have national news stories.
[00:41:39.634 --> 00:41:44.355]  Well, that makes James O'Keefe come on, because he's a leader.
[00:41:44.355 --> 00:41:52.339]  Matt Drudge just talked about, or you've seen in the news, where Media Matters tells him not to link to somebody, he just starts linking to them more.
[00:41:52.339 --> 00:41:53.339]  But that's called leadership.
[00:41:53.339 --> 00:41:57.281]  And by the way, that's not an ass-kissing exercise I engaged in.
[00:41:57.281 --> 00:42:02.743]  You have to highlight things that are effective, and that are truthful, and that are manly.
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:15.165]  Because there's plenty of men out there who are Green Berets and Navy SEALs and all this other stuff, but they won't politically, the minute you've got heat, even talk to you.
[00:42:15.165 --> 00:42:18.046]  Oh, before you're under attack, they want to be your buddy and they're all about
[00:42:18.936 --> 00:42:21.557]  Their own personal monetary success.
[00:42:21.557 --> 00:42:23.357]  Not all of them, but a lot of them.
[00:42:23.357 --> 00:42:31.620]  But then you'll just get average Americans and other people that understand that when something's under attack, that means it's really important and it's special and needs to be defended.
[00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:41.943]  And so we've got store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points, and 50-60% off everything right there, and your funding funds this operation.
[00:42:41.943 --> 00:42:43.423]  We have a lot of extra sales right now.
[00:42:43.423 --> 00:42:44.944]  You can also make straight donations.
[00:42:46.261 --> 00:42:49.025]  Infowars.com or Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:42:49.025 --> 00:42:51.187]  Just go make a $100 donation, a $50 donation.
[00:42:51.187 --> 00:42:56.234]  There's all these wealthy people that sit on their hands and then it's the little widows and people that are financing us.
[00:42:56.234 --> 00:42:58.397]  It shouldn't be the widows, it should be the men of this country.
[00:42:59.833 --> 00:43:15.725]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square, the other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[00:43:15.725 --> 00:43:17.447]  It is completely independent of all that.
[00:43:17.447 --> 00:43:24.112]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of the press and freedom of speech.
[00:43:24.292 --> 00:43:25.113]  We're good to go.
[00:43:48.456 --> 00:43:52.261]  From the founding to the modern age, ultimate American democracy and freedom.
[00:43:52.261 --> 00:43:58.469]  And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming, defamation, lawfare and libel targeting you.
[00:44:01.031 --> 00:44:05.112]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:44:05.112 --> 00:44:08.273]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
[00:44:08.273 --> 00:44:11.434]  And we're under unprecedented evil attacks, as you've seen.
[00:44:11.434 --> 00:44:23.638]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[00:44:23.638 --> 00:44:28.800]  And so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart.
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.020]  And I want you to know that love is right back
[00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:31.721]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:45:01.647 --> 00:45:18.205]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits, the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[00:45:18.325 --> 00:45:22.408]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll shut us down.
[00:45:22.408 --> 00:45:26.110]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they work.
[00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:27.872]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[00:45:27.872 --> 00:45:32.095]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[00:45:32.095 --> 00:45:40.020]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:42.742]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[00:45:42.742 --> 00:45:47.646]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[00:45:47.646 --> 00:45:48.827]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[00:45:48.827 --> 00:45:49.827]  They have side effects.
[00:45:49.827 --> 00:45:50.728]  Not with Mother Nature.
[00:45:50.728 --> 00:45:54.411]  But Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[00:45:54.411 --> 00:45:56.312]  InfoWareStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:46:01.198 --> 00:46:07.142]  Last night, I'm on InfoWars.com, and I read Chris Pratt criticized for t-shirt choice.
[00:46:07.142 --> 00:46:10.665]  It is literally the shirt that I envisioned.
[00:46:10.665 --> 00:46:17.270]  A Betsy Ross, but also another just classic American flag, all 50 stars, with the Gadsden snake superimposed over it.
[00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:20.112]  And on the back, America's back, InfoWars.com.
[00:46:20.112 --> 00:46:21.633]  But what's better than just an American flag?
[00:46:21.633 --> 00:46:23.654]  How about a don't tread on me under the flag?
[00:46:23.654 --> 00:46:24.755]  Say don't tread on the American flag.
[00:46:24.875 --> 00:46:25.695]  It's a perfect combo.
[00:46:25.695 --> 00:46:26.736]  So great minds think alike.
[00:46:26.736 --> 00:46:30.518]  I mean, whoever designed that shirt, we'd already come up with the exact same similar design.
[00:46:30.518 --> 00:46:37.981]  It is the Don't Tread on Me American flag t-shirt inspired by the triggering of leftist of the shirt worn by Chris Pratt.
[00:46:37.981 --> 00:46:41.483]  But it's a battle tattered flag like the one that flew over Fort Sumter.
[00:46:41.483 --> 00:46:45.565]  And again, on the back, it says America's Back Infowars.com.
[00:46:46.926 --> 00:46:49.289]  4,000 of these babies and that's it.
[00:46:49.289 --> 00:46:56.195]  So we've got the Betsy Ross version and the American flag version at InfoWarsTore.com being printed in the USA right now.
[00:46:56.195 --> 00:46:57.236]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:46:57.236 --> 00:46:58.217]  We'll be right back.
[00:46:58.217 --> 00:47:02.782]  The most banned broadcast in the world.
[00:47:02.782 --> 00:47:05.385]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:29.707 --> 00:47:33.069]  There's the Fox Theater right there.
[00:47:33.069 --> 00:47:39.334]  Here's the Union Watch Party.
[00:47:39.334 --> 00:47:48.000]  As you can see, there's really not that many people here to watch the debate at the Union Watch Party.
[00:47:54.424 --> 00:47:56.126]  They are going to pay for all of this.
[00:47:56.126 --> 00:47:58.148]  They get the whole footprint.
[00:47:58.148 --> 00:48:01.071]  He said CNN credentials or just regular press credentials?
[00:48:01.071 --> 00:48:03.214]  Money talks, you guys know that.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:03.334]  Sure.
[00:48:03.334 --> 00:48:06.717]  CNN is going to pay for this whole footprint.
[00:48:06.717 --> 00:48:10.862]  When does the public space start, sir?
[00:48:10.862 --> 00:48:11.563]  At the next block?
[00:48:12.645 --> 00:48:16.387]  A lot of people said you did good during the Bayside.
[00:48:16.387 --> 00:48:17.048]  Do you feel glad?
[00:48:32.797 --> 00:48:34.918]  Yeah, I feel really glad, especially after the last debate.
[00:48:34.918 --> 00:48:40.601]  I feel like I didn't get a chance to lay out my vision for the economy of the country, and I feel like I did this time, so it's great.
[00:48:40.601 --> 00:48:46.285]  Well, what do you think about... No, no, what do you think about... Sorry, I just want one question.
[00:48:46.285 --> 00:48:47.246]  Just one question.
[00:48:47.246 --> 00:48:48.346]  Just one question.
[00:48:48.346 --> 00:48:49.987]  Okay.
[00:48:49.987 --> 00:48:54.190]  Why do you think that we need to have a news ombudsman in America?
[00:48:55.011 --> 00:49:00.134]  We're just about to enter the era of deep fakes, where we're not going to be able to make heads or tails of the stuff we're seeing online.
[00:49:00.134 --> 00:49:02.876]  And we know the Russians have already been hacking us.
[00:49:02.876 --> 00:49:10.041]  It's going to get worse, but literally you could have a picture of me saying words, a video, and it could be something that gets doctored.
[00:49:10.041 --> 00:49:12.202]  So we need to start having countermeasures in place.
[00:49:12.202 --> 00:49:12.863]  That's why I believe in it.
[00:49:12.863 --> 00:49:16.265]  Do you think it's really good to be policing the press, though, and speech?
[00:49:17.646 --> 00:49:21.969]  Do you think it's good to be policing free speech?
[00:49:21.969 --> 00:49:25.371]  Is it really a good idea to be policing the press?
[00:49:25.371 --> 00:49:28.352]  The goal is to protect the American people.
[00:49:28.352 --> 00:49:33.535]  But isn't it, you know, you guys are supposed to protect our rights, right, as Americans?
[00:49:33.535 --> 00:49:39.379]  She keeps following Millie Waver, Andrew Yang, who's a real authoritarian dart bag.
[00:49:39.379 --> 00:49:40.720]  Really knows how to manipulate people.
[00:49:41.741 --> 00:49:46.104]  Telling us, oh, we need a government special office that controls what can be seen and heard.
[00:49:46.104 --> 00:49:47.985]  That's called a national censor.
[00:49:47.985 --> 00:49:49.946]  Communist China and North Korea have those.
[00:49:49.946 --> 00:49:52.607]  Russia had those.
[00:49:52.607 --> 00:49:54.568]  Oh, because of deepfakes.
[00:49:54.568 --> 00:49:58.851]  Oh, you mean like the media saying that Trump called black people rats?
[00:49:58.851 --> 00:49:59.851]  That's not a deepfake.
[00:49:59.851 --> 00:50:01.692]  That's just a total lie.
[00:50:01.692 --> 00:50:06.915]  He said, stop saying the Border Patrol does a terrible job and is killing kids.
[00:50:06.915 --> 00:50:10.017]  It's very nice conditions for the women and children.
[00:50:10.017 --> 00:50:11.278]  Your city's falling apart.
[00:50:12.509 --> 00:50:16.390]  It's infested with drugs and rats!
[00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:19.411]  That's what you say, that area is infested with crime.
[00:50:19.411 --> 00:50:29.814]  And it turns out there's video of Elijah Cummings saying that, and Bernie Tenders, but see it doesn't matter because it's all about fraud.
[00:50:29.814 --> 00:50:35.155]  And so we'll have a special office run by Andrew Yang that tells us
[00:50:36.505 --> 00:50:39.352]  I know he's not from China, but he really should go there.
[00:50:39.352 --> 00:50:42.238]  They'd probably bring him into the Politburo.
[00:50:42.238 --> 00:50:45.004]  Maybe he could be dictator after he steps down someday.
[00:50:47.429 --> 00:50:49.109]  So it's just incredible.
[00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:49.790]  Here's what I'm going to do.
[00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:51.650]  I had a very interesting guest.
[00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:53.791]  I've seen some of his videos online about natural law.
[00:50:53.791 --> 00:50:56.891]  I think Mark Passio coming on, but I decided to move him in next week.
[00:50:56.891 --> 00:51:02.813]  I apologize because I'd forgotten that I'm going to be on a work occasion tomorrow, taking care of some new projects.
[00:51:02.813 --> 00:51:04.653]  So that kind of scrambled up what we're going to do.
[00:51:04.653 --> 00:51:06.174]  So he'll be on next week.
[00:51:06.174 --> 00:51:11.095]  I still have a guest on who has been over in Hong Kong at these demonstrations.
[00:51:11.095 --> 00:51:14.796]  And he also heads up the National Prayer Group and he's coming on at
[00:51:15.736 --> 00:51:16.437]  What time is that?
[00:51:16.437 --> 00:51:17.417]  It's one o'clock central.
[00:51:17.417 --> 00:51:27.142]  Joey Gibson, he's part Japanese, so he speaks a lot of the language over there and has been in Hong Kong and has just gotten back after several weeks there.
[00:51:27.142 --> 00:51:28.843]  He's going to give us a frontline report.
[00:51:28.843 --> 00:51:35.086]  He took part in many of the demonstrations that are for the citizens not being secretly arrested and disappeared to mainline China.
[00:51:35.846 --> 00:51:40.530]  And it looks like China is going to officially invade Hong Kong.
[00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:45.534]  And Trump just blinked, which I don't see how he couldn't because Hong Kong's pretty much been part of China.
[00:51:45.534 --> 00:51:47.816]  Taiwan's a different kettle of fish.
[00:51:47.816 --> 00:51:53.120]  But the Chinese military built a big giant bridge into there, one of the biggest in the world.
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.201]  They're amassing troops.
[00:51:54.201 --> 00:51:58.364]  And I just don't think there's anything we can do if they invade Hong Kong.
[00:51:58.364 --> 00:52:00.145]  It's going to be a blood bath.
[00:52:02.538 --> 00:52:11.790]  And it could easily kick off into something much, much bigger that will make Tiananmen Square that killed thousands look like just a walk in the park.
[00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:16.496]  So this whole thing is deteriorating very, very, very quickly.
[00:52:16.496 --> 00:52:19.000]  There are a lot of smuggled weapons in Hong Kong.
[00:52:20.357 --> 00:52:27.022]  And again, the folks in Hong Kong are, again, historically very businesslike, very professional, very smart.
[00:52:27.022 --> 00:52:30.185]  But once wars kick off over there, it's never pretty.
[00:52:30.185 --> 00:52:33.487]  Let's just say people don't hesitate to start killing each other.
[00:52:33.487 --> 00:52:35.028]  So this is not a game.
[00:52:35.028 --> 00:52:38.091]  It's very, very dangerous.
[00:52:38.091 --> 00:52:42.374]  And, I mean, we had to kill something like a million Chinese in the Korean War.
[00:52:42.374 --> 00:52:43.535]  A million of them.
[00:52:43.535 --> 00:52:45.396]  They just kept coming.
[00:52:45.396 --> 00:52:47.578]  And then MacArthur said, drop atomic weapons on them.
[00:52:49.921 --> 00:52:53.182]  Old Ding Dong chickened out.
[00:52:53.182 --> 00:53:00.763]  We wouldn't even have the Chi-Coms in charge today if it wasn't for Harry S. Truman, who helped the CIA put China and the Communists in charge.
[00:53:00.763 --> 00:53:03.943]  And then a few years later, we're fighting them in Korea.
[00:53:03.943 --> 00:53:06.784]  Simply amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:06.784 --> 00:53:12.885]  I don't want to use nuclear weapons, but at the same time, it would have been nice to never have the Chi-Coms, right?
[00:53:12.885 --> 00:53:18.486]  You know, MacArthur thought about a coup, and the military wanted to have a coup and remove
[00:53:20.322 --> 00:53:21.922]  The Democrats.
[00:53:21.922 --> 00:53:26.384]  And MacArthur said, no, we'll beat the Communists down the road.
[00:53:26.384 --> 00:53:29.805]  And he recruited people like Richard Nixon and others to his cause.
[00:53:29.805 --> 00:53:32.866]  But it was a day late, a dollar short.
[00:53:32.866 --> 00:53:41.648]  Because if he would have removed Harry Truman, who was a traitor, signed us over to the UN, the Russians, you name it, we would not be in this position today.
[00:53:41.648 --> 00:53:42.709]  Now, who knows what would have happened?
[00:53:42.709 --> 00:53:43.929]  History would have been totally different.
[00:53:45.147 --> 00:53:56.050]  You're looking back on hindsight, siding with the Communist Chinese, giving them the military's coordinates, letting them overrun our troops, because the UN was giving all the information to them.
[00:53:56.050 --> 00:53:57.171]  It's just treason!
[00:53:57.171 --> 00:54:00.592]  And I'm sick of sitting here, propping up Communist China.
[00:54:00.592 --> 00:54:10.835]  So now, 60-something years later, China's got the Panama Canal, our infrastructure, our debt, 98% of the rare earth minerals.
[00:54:13.325 --> 00:54:17.867]  And they're just taking over the planet and are set to invade Hong Kong.
[00:54:17.867 --> 00:54:19.828]  And they sell political dissidents organs.
[00:54:19.828 --> 00:54:21.589]  They have millions in death camps.
[00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:25.251]  They torture non-violent Buddhists to death.
[00:54:25.251 --> 00:54:26.792]  They torture Christians to death.
[00:54:26.792 --> 00:54:28.833]  I'm sick of it!
[00:54:28.833 --> 00:54:36.677]  But here we are, ladies and gentlemen, all these years later, dealing with this.
[00:54:37.717 --> 00:54:40.079]  And now they're set to invade Taiwan.
[00:54:40.079 --> 00:54:45.203]  And you know, I understand that we just probably at this point can't go to war if China takes over Hong Kong.
[00:54:45.203 --> 00:54:47.284]  Because it did used to be part of China.
[00:54:47.284 --> 00:54:50.507]  But the legitimate government ran to Taiwan.
[00:54:50.507 --> 00:54:54.130]  If they try to take Taiwan, all hell's gonna break loose.
[00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:58.053]  A large part of the population will resist even if the government goes along.
[00:54:58.053 --> 00:55:01.856]  And this government's not going along.
[00:55:01.856 --> 00:55:03.397]  Trump's shipping all those weapons in there.
[00:55:04.946 --> 00:55:06.887]  So he's not blinking on that front.
[00:55:06.887 --> 00:55:20.958]  It looks like we're going to make our stand here in the South China Sea islands and the Spratlys to the north and looks like we're going to make our stand here at Taiwan for the next big war.
[00:55:20.958 --> 00:55:21.878]  But it's going to kick off.
[00:55:21.878 --> 00:55:22.459]  It can kick off.
[00:55:23.976 --> 00:55:28.158]  We could be in a full-scale war with China as early as tomorrow, next week.
[00:55:28.158 --> 00:55:36.962]  Now, I'm not saying that's going to happen, but all the money is on this being where the next big war starts, if not Pakistan and India, that have already been attacking each other this year.
[00:55:36.962 --> 00:55:42.745]  Then you've got Israel, starting a proxy war with Hezbollah in Syria.
[00:55:42.745 --> 00:55:44.525]  This is a very interesting time.
[00:55:44.525 --> 00:55:49.808]  So, that's coming up next hour, and I'm going to play clips from the big debate.
[00:55:50.905 --> 00:55:54.046]  And then I haven't gotten into the biggest news here.
[00:55:54.046 --> 00:55:56.606]  I'm sorry, tooting our horn, it's true.
[00:55:56.606 --> 00:56:04.527]  I specifically said Jeffrey Epstein was engaged in rituals ten years ago at his island.
[00:56:04.527 --> 00:56:06.288]  You can go pull those articles up.
[00:56:06.288 --> 00:56:10.088]  And that he was carrying out transhumanism.
[00:56:10.088 --> 00:56:13.209]  And that always part of the Satanism is this transhumanism.
[00:56:13.209 --> 00:56:19.710]  Well, Jeffrey Epstein hoped to seed human race with his DNA and had a race
[00:56:20.928 --> 00:56:23.449]  study facility built in New Mexico.
[00:56:23.449 --> 00:56:25.970]  Now that's even in the New York Times, but it goes deeper than that.
[00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:29.152]  They're acting like, oh, he was saying this at all these dinners and meetings.
[00:56:29.152 --> 00:56:32.013]  No, that's all they talk about at these dinners and meetings.
[00:56:32.013 --> 00:56:34.314]  It is their religion.
[00:56:34.314 --> 00:56:39.677]  So I'm going to show you where 11 years ago, with the video, I broke all this down.
[00:56:39.677 --> 00:56:44.739]  And it's not because I'm a seer, like the National Review said.
[00:56:44.739 --> 00:56:46.360]  Jones isn't a seer.
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:48.741]  He just was lucky on Epstein.
[00:56:48.741 --> 00:56:49.922]  And everything else, basically.
[00:56:51.127 --> 00:56:54.531]  I'm not a seer, I'm a studier.
[00:56:54.531 --> 00:56:59.417]  A seer has to look through the ether and magically know what's going on.
[00:56:59.417 --> 00:57:05.644]  I can study the enemy and study the globalists and then I can figure out their next moves are and it does seem like I'm seeing
[00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:15.143]  And I guess when you do shoot bullseye at 800 yards of scope, I mean, a little bit becomes like almost a seeing thing, but it's not that.
[00:57:15.143 --> 00:57:16.803]  It's just skill and training.
[00:57:16.803 --> 00:57:20.745]  It's the same thing with something like this or it's the same thing with being a master golfer or anything.
[00:57:20.745 --> 00:57:28.328]  It's studying history and the pathological behavior of the globalist and the algorithms that our electrochemical brains come up with.
[00:57:29.338 --> 00:57:35.562]  But the real reason we're here is because you saw, you believed in this broadcast, and you supported it.
[00:57:35.562 --> 00:57:38.685]  You sensed history was happening, and you are a giant part of it.

[00:58:50.709 --> 00:58:52.710]  Robert Moritz, what has Big Tech become?
[00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:54.732]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[00:58:54.732 --> 00:59:01.236]  And the way they did so is because they faced no consequence, social, economic, political, or legal, for their illicit activities over two decades.
[00:59:01.236 --> 00:59:13.305]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct.
[00:59:13.305 --> 00:59:16.387]  Otherwise, they will never change, and they will become the Big Tech oligarchs
[00:59:16.567 --> 00:59:18.587]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[00:59:46.494 --> 00:59:48.417]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[00:59:48.417 --> 00:59:53.784]  Even it is what you just saw.
[00:59:53.784 --> 00:59:56.387]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:13.155 --> 01:00:17.119]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:17.119 --> 01:00:20.302]  If you agree with me, go to Joe30330 and help me in this fight.
[01:00:20.302 --> 01:00:22.884]  You wanna hear that again?
[01:00:22.884 --> 01:00:25.327]  You wanna see that again?
[01:00:38.168 --> 01:00:46.672]  If you agree with me, go to Joe30330 and help me in this fight.
[01:00:46.672 --> 01:00:49.594]  Let's cue that back up one more time and play it in a second.
[01:00:49.594 --> 01:00:55.997]  You know, it was a couple months ago that Facebook said they're banning using my name or InfoWars.com in a positive way.
[01:00:55.997 --> 01:00:58.358]  If you want to be disparaging, have at him.
[01:00:58.358 --> 01:01:06.902]  But he doesn't have a way to respond, and he's Prasad Nangrata, the Chinese social credit score, but have at him all you want, free for all.
[01:01:08.851 --> 01:01:11.052]  Think about that.
[01:01:11.052 --> 01:01:14.073]  And I read the articles of why they banned me.
[01:01:14.073 --> 01:01:20.996]  They said, well, the last straw was his disinformation that, has Biden had a second stroke?
[01:01:20.996 --> 01:01:29.720]  And I played where he said the top of his head got chopped off, and he talked about how he almost died, and the doctor said he'd probably never be normal again, and he appears to have neurological problems.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.021]  I said, has he had a second stroke?
[01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:33.842]  Because every speech, he can barely talk.
[01:01:33.842 --> 01:01:35.823]  He has like a bunch of marbles in his mouth.
[01:01:37.059 --> 01:01:40.340]  From just a year ago, I mean, he sounds like he's going to be in a nursing home.
[01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:47.841]  I mean, my grandmother talked better than him when she was 92, and then she died.
[01:01:47.841 --> 01:01:50.702]  They said, oh, he's the presumptive leader.
[01:01:50.702 --> 01:01:53.322]  You can't point out the obvious.
[01:01:53.322 --> 01:01:55.183]  Now it's all over the news.
[01:01:55.183 --> 01:01:56.483]  He's got cognitive problems.
[01:01:56.483 --> 01:01:57.743]  He's got neurological problems.
[01:01:57.743 --> 01:02:00.084]  Doctors weigh in on what may be slurring speech.
[01:02:00.084 --> 01:02:03.805]  Maybe it's that stroke he had, and that brain surgery, and those embolisms.
[01:02:03.805 --> 01:02:05.425]  Exactly what I told you!
[01:02:06.587 --> 01:02:12.010]  And again, it's like looking up at the night sky and saying, what color is it?
[01:02:12.010 --> 01:02:17.073]  Well, it's black and it's blue and it's red and it's yellow, but mainly it's black.
[01:02:17.073 --> 01:02:18.174]  Or what color is the sun?
[01:02:18.174 --> 01:02:19.455]  It's yellow.
[01:02:19.455 --> 01:02:20.415]  Or what color is grass?
[01:02:20.415 --> 01:02:21.916]  It's green.
[01:02:21.916 --> 01:02:25.318]  I'm not doing anything fancy pants here.
[01:02:25.318 --> 01:02:27.680]  But see, I'm calling them out when the President says,
[01:02:29.209 --> 01:02:32.411]  You know, Elijah Cummings, you shouldn't have said the Border Patrol's doing a horrible job.
[01:02:32.411 --> 01:02:40.417]  You're the Democrats that blocked the funding, and you're the ones telling everybody to come up here and get free stuff, and then you sit there and say that we're doing all these bad things to kids when we're not.
[01:02:40.417 --> 01:02:41.939]  You want to clean up your district.
[01:02:41.939 --> 01:02:44.360]  It's the highest crime rate in the country per capita.
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.842]  You've got rats, and there's documentaries about it.
[01:02:46.842 --> 01:02:49.784]  And it's like, you just called me a rat.
[01:02:49.784 --> 01:02:52.066]  I'm like, no, I just said you've got a rat problem.
[01:02:52.066 --> 01:02:53.367]  You just called a black man a rat.
[01:02:53.367 --> 01:02:54.528]  You're like, no, I didn't.
[01:02:54.528 --> 01:02:56.670]  Yeah, you did.
[01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:57.050]  Yeah, you did.
[01:02:59.895 --> 01:03:03.517]  And then it just becomes this whole obsession.
[01:03:03.517 --> 01:03:07.800]  And it goes on and on and on and on and on.
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:15.704]  And then you get video of Elijah Cummings saying that it's drug infested.
[01:03:15.704 --> 01:03:20.587]  And then you get clips of every other politician saying, including the mayor.
[01:03:20.587 --> 01:03:24.990]  But none of that matters because to the people attacking Trump, it's not about logic.
[01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:26.451]  It's the power structure that wants power.
[01:03:27.622 --> 01:03:35.750]  And then it's the idiots that think they're part of the power structure because they support it when they're the ones getting screwed over by it.
[01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:38.312]  But that's why they're called losers, why they're called schmucks.
[01:03:39.286 --> 01:03:43.788]  It's very, very sad that you can't un-schmuck a schmuck.
[01:03:43.788 --> 01:03:53.352]  You can't seem to get fools and dumbasses and idiots to ever stop getting scammed because they're low IQ and they're stupid and they come in every color.
[01:03:53.352 --> 01:03:56.233]  White and black and brown and pink.
[01:03:56.233 --> 01:03:58.734]  Well, I know dumbasses every stripe, man.
[01:03:58.734 --> 01:04:04.557]  And I can't stand the type of people that drive 15 miles over the speed limit in the fast lane when the road's open.
[01:04:05.509 --> 01:04:13.010]  The type of people that when they go into a turn lane, an underpass, and there's an open lane, and you got a white line all the way out, they still stop?
[01:04:14.171 --> 01:04:17.253]  And I've actually followed one of the people before into a McDonald's.
[01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:19.014]  They turned into the same gas station.
[01:04:19.014 --> 01:04:23.236]  And I said, hey, you know, back there, a mile, you don't have to stop.
[01:04:23.236 --> 01:04:24.097]  And they went, huh?
[01:04:24.097 --> 01:04:25.637]  I went, do you speak English?
[01:04:25.637 --> 01:04:27.298]  He goes, yeah, who are you?
[01:04:27.298 --> 01:04:29.720]  And I said, and I'm just like, never mind.
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:31.701]  You just don't understand, do you?
[01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:33.522]  Because you're dumb.
[01:04:33.522 --> 01:04:34.802]  And you're dangerous.
[01:04:34.802 --> 01:04:39.265]  Because you will, you will vote me into a frickin' FEMA camp.
[01:04:41.346 --> 01:04:46.928]  I'll be there carrying your garbage out while you sit above me with a machine gun.
[01:04:46.928 --> 01:04:48.389]  That's what the left wants, our guns, man.
[01:04:48.389 --> 01:04:53.571]  They want to make us their slaves so damn bad, like all these inner city people they've got as slaves.
[01:04:53.571 --> 01:04:58.853]  And they know it, and Trump wants to stop it, and they hate him for that.
[01:04:58.853 --> 01:05:03.635]  Serving with InfoWars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[01:05:05.003 --> 01:05:14.407]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[01:05:14.407 --> 01:05:26.051]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[01:05:26.051 --> 01:05:30.233]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[01:05:31.153 --> 01:05:35.197]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[01:05:35.197 --> 01:05:42.102]  So if you love coffee, and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[01:05:42.102 --> 01:05:45.025]  Order now at the InfoWars store.
[01:05:45.025 --> 01:05:54.713]  Sign up for auto-ship and get your own high-quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:08.229 --> 01:06:18.752]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:18.752 --> 01:06:22.113]  Okay, here's what we're gonna do, my friends.
[01:06:22.113 --> 01:06:23.474]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour...
[01:06:24.724 --> 01:06:28.067]  I'm going to open the phones up, but I'm only going to take 10 phone calls so I get to all of you.
[01:06:28.067 --> 01:06:33.270]  And then when we're done with those 10, we'll open the phones up again, because it's the only way to not have you sit on the cold for an hour.
[01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:35.452]  So we're going to open the phones up.
[01:06:35.452 --> 01:06:37.574]  Pretty much right now, I'll give the number out.
[01:06:37.574 --> 01:06:41.777]  But at the bottom of the hour, we'll take your calls on any subject you want to discuss.
[01:06:41.777 --> 01:06:49.663]  The debates last night, China basically already invading Hong Kong, already sending in plainclothes paramilitary massing troops.
[01:06:51.189 --> 01:06:53.291]  White House says it looks like they're going to invade completely.
[01:06:53.291 --> 01:06:55.412]  Trump says go soft on it.
[01:06:55.412 --> 01:06:58.815]  I just don't think we can do anything.
[01:06:58.815 --> 01:07:00.396]  They've got a bridge linking to it now.
[01:07:00.396 --> 01:07:01.858]  It's not like Taiwan.
[01:07:01.858 --> 01:07:03.779]  This is going to be a mess.
[01:07:03.779 --> 01:07:09.204]  Expansionist China, wound up by the globalists, given all our industry, given all our jobs, sold out.
[01:07:10.145 --> 01:07:23.588]  But turn on CNN, we hear about how Trump's a globalist, or excuse me, an agent of the Rooskies, when it's the globalists who are the ones telling us, take down our American flags, America was never great and will never be that great.
[01:07:25.373 --> 01:07:26.454]  So we're going to open the phones up.
[01:07:26.454 --> 01:07:34.602]  We can also talk about the big article up on InfoWars.com, Antifa publicly organizing terror attacks on ICE facilities in Texas.
[01:07:34.602 --> 01:07:49.856]  The official national group, funded by Alexander Soros, officially says they're going to lay siege to border facilities, ICE facilities, and they show graphics of how to firebomb and kill people with images of pools of blood and dead ICE.
[01:07:51.989 --> 01:07:59.013]  Officers, so I'd like to get your take on that, specifically if you're police or military or been in the Border Patrol or ICE.
[01:07:59.013 --> 01:08:00.034]  What are you thinking about this?
[01:08:00.034 --> 01:08:02.996]  You just got firebombed a few weeks ago and they said the guy was a hero.
[01:08:02.996 --> 01:08:03.056]  877-789-2539.
[01:08:03.056 --> 01:08:03.216]  877-789-Alex.
[01:08:03.216 --> 01:08:03.676]  877-789-2539.
[01:08:03.676 --> 01:08:07.098]  I promise, we're only gonna take 10 calls at a time, so you don't have to hold that long.
[01:08:07.098 --> 01:08:08.219]  That's coming up.
[01:08:08.219 --> 01:08:08.379]  877-789-Alex.
[01:08:08.379 --> 01:08:08.940]  But in the meantime,
[01:08:22.628 --> 01:08:25.671]  I want to hit two big things here.
[01:08:25.671 --> 01:08:31.515]  And obviously during the calls we'll mix in a lot of other news and clips.
[01:08:31.515 --> 01:08:36.139]  New York area fire commissioners make history, say that there were clearly bombs in the buildings.
[01:08:36.139 --> 01:08:42.845]  Now they said that back then, but these are people with degrees in engineering and in fire control.
[01:08:42.845 --> 01:08:44.206]  And it doesn't mean there isn't radical Islam.
[01:08:44.206 --> 01:08:45.647]  It doesn't mean that Saudi Arabia wasn't involved.
[01:08:45.647 --> 01:08:46.388]  That's what I keep saying.
[01:08:47.333 --> 01:08:54.758]  means that there were people inside the government working with it in a larger plan just like they did the Arab Spring.
[01:08:54.758 --> 01:09:15.551]  I'm gonna hit that because this press conference happened seven days ago and it's still gotten no coverage other than Infowars.com and some local New York news and then of course this because if you understand this you understand everything Jeffrey Epstein hoped to seed human race with his DNA
[01:09:18.504 --> 01:09:34.917]  And you've pretty much got to read the whole article because if you know what we know, or you've seen Endgame, Blueprint for Global Disability, it's free online, you understand what he was really doing.
[01:09:34.917 --> 01:09:45.246]  He built a Cold Springs Harbor facility with a medical wing, everything, in New Mexico to study life extension
[01:09:46.798 --> 01:09:50.463]  And studying genetic clones.
[01:09:50.463 --> 01:09:53.006]  Now, this is all going to come out.
[01:09:53.006 --> 01:09:58.412]  But right now, they're like, oh, he had all these top scientists in, but they weren't involved, and he was all just making this stuff up.
[01:09:58.412 --> 01:10:00.235]  Uh-huh, right.
[01:10:00.235 --> 01:10:00.435]  Sure.
[01:10:03.342 --> 01:10:17.479]  Believe me folks, they're taking hardcore drugs, they're getting all sorts of blood transfusions, and they need all this medical stuff, and kids that these birth mothers have, like Rosemary's baby, they get used for all this stuff.
[01:10:17.479 --> 01:10:20.143]  Remember I told you about the Hollywood cults that were branding people?
[01:10:21.311 --> 01:10:24.213]  And starving women to death because they want them skinny and pathetic.
[01:10:24.213 --> 01:10:25.975]  That was three years ago, I told you.
[01:10:25.975 --> 01:10:34.262]  Huffington Post came out and attacked me and said, how dare Jones say Harvey Weinstein is connected to groups that brand women and get them incredibly skinny.
[01:10:34.262 --> 01:10:35.422]  They're like, why would they want to do that?
[01:10:35.422 --> 01:10:39.766]  They want to see beautiful women freaked out, anorexic, hating themselves.
[01:10:39.766 --> 01:10:41.948]  It's the seeing them emaciated.
[01:10:41.948 --> 01:10:45.951]  It's a vampiric event.
[01:10:45.951 --> 01:10:48.133]  It's a demonic vampire spirit.
[01:10:50.151 --> 01:10:51.391]  You go, oh that's mumbo-jumbo.
[01:10:51.391 --> 01:10:56.352]  No, it's all inter-dimensional, folks.
[01:10:56.352 --> 01:10:58.993]  It's all inter-dimensional feeding.
[01:10:58.993 --> 01:11:03.154]  The next best thing to torturing a child to death is screwing one up.
[01:11:03.154 --> 01:11:14.696]  The next best thing to that, than killing a woman, is if you can starve them, destroy their self-confidence, and then feed off them and use them as slaves.
[01:11:14.696 --> 01:11:17.837]  The more beautiful the woman, the more you want to degradate them.
[01:11:18.789 --> 01:11:19.750]  It's the pimp life.
[01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:22.171]  Remember that famous HBO show about pimps?
[01:11:22.171 --> 01:11:28.015]  His daughter's been run over, or the daughter's been run over, and the mother's there going, my baby, my baby, she's hurt.
[01:11:28.015 --> 01:11:33.018]  And the daughter's saying to the pimp who's been putting cigarettes out on her, baby, I'm gonna get back on the street for you.
[01:11:33.018 --> 01:11:33.758]  I'm gonna get you that money.
[01:11:33.758 --> 01:11:36.500]  That's right, bitch, she's gonna give me that money.
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:39.502]  And the mother's like, you don't even pay my daughter anything, do you?
[01:11:39.502 --> 01:11:40.842]  She goes, no, I don't give her anything.
[01:11:40.842 --> 01:11:42.263]  She pays me the money.
[01:11:42.263 --> 01:11:44.925]  She's lucky if I get her a bucket of chicken once a week.
[01:11:46.617 --> 01:11:48.138]  You think pimps invented that?
[01:11:48.138 --> 01:11:51.559]  That's nothing!
[01:11:51.559 --> 01:11:55.161]  It's all about using people.
[01:11:55.161 --> 01:11:56.781]  That's what Democrats do.
[01:11:56.781 --> 01:11:58.282]  They pimp their constituents.
[01:11:58.282 --> 01:11:59.442]  They don't want you successful.
[01:11:59.442 --> 01:12:00.743]  They don't want you empowered.
[01:12:00.743 --> 01:12:05.185]  They want you run over, dominated, controlled.
[01:12:05.185 --> 01:12:12.388]  So exactly what I told you they're doing is in the news because I've talked to people that have been involved.
[01:12:12.388 --> 01:12:13.708]  I've studied their writings.
[01:12:13.708 --> 01:12:14.849]  I know what they're doing.
[01:12:20.439 --> 01:12:27.146]  And until people start to realize this, you're going to be used by them.
[01:12:27.146 --> 01:12:31.230]  And it's so sad how their followers believe that they're actually part of the winning team.
[01:12:31.230 --> 01:12:37.217]  But if you actually go study Antifa or Democrats, even low-level ones that are making $10 an hour from George Soros,
[01:12:39.841 --> 01:12:47.464]  They have the pimp attitude and can't wait till they graduate up to be controlling and running people, and they know it's a fraud.
[01:12:47.464 --> 01:12:49.165]  They know it's all a scam.
[01:12:49.165 --> 01:12:51.286]  They know it's a criminal endeavor.
[01:12:51.286 --> 01:12:55.108]  They just want to take over Austin and kill people and move into their houses.
[01:12:55.108 --> 01:13:00.030]  They're just dreaming of some Soviet grandeur.
[01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:02.351]  Like the Jacobin French Revolution, that's all they're doing.
[01:13:04.087 --> 01:13:11.570]  But the first thing I want to do when we come back is I want to get to some of these debate clubs because they're really, really powerful to watch them eat their own.
[01:13:11.570 --> 01:13:12.891]  I like to be on air.
[01:13:12.891 --> 01:13:14.811]  But I gotta tell you, two nights in a row, I had to leave.
[01:13:14.811 --> 01:13:19.873]  I mean, I actually, an hour and a half in, I got up and said, sorry folks, I can't look at them anymore.
[01:13:19.873 --> 01:13:21.854]  I went home and listened to the show and everybody did a great job.
[01:13:21.854 --> 01:13:24.935]  But I can't look at them.
[01:13:24.935 --> 01:13:31.178]  But I gotta say, Tulsi Gabbard, who keeps winning the debates online, who they keep trying to hide from everybody,
[01:13:32.614 --> 01:13:38.395]  She says a lot of really good things that challenge the fraud of the SJW Democrats.
[01:13:38.395 --> 01:13:39.735]  I still wouldn't want to elect her.
[01:13:39.735 --> 01:13:41.476]  She's still not pro-gun.
[01:13:41.476 --> 01:13:46.677]  But I think she's a genuine person who really believes what she's saying, and it's why she doesn't look soulless.
[01:13:46.677 --> 01:13:53.118]  Every time she was up there, I could look at her, not just because she's pretty, but I didn't feel sick inside.
[01:13:53.118 --> 01:13:56.799]  But almost everyone else up there made me want to jump out of a window.
[01:13:58.786 --> 01:14:02.309]  That's because deep down you know these aren't real people.
[01:14:02.309 --> 01:14:04.310]  Kamala Harris?
[01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:07.413]  Give me a break.
[01:14:07.413 --> 01:14:13.617]  And you know Joe Biden's bad news, horrible guy, but he at least had some humanity back when he had energy.
[01:14:13.617 --> 01:14:17.740]  He can't keep his hands off anybody.
[01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:22.184]  But look, he's just a doddering person now.
[01:14:22.184 --> 01:14:23.725]  So what are they going to do?
[01:14:23.725 --> 01:14:27.228]  And then the only real people that were up on the stage, oh they want both.
[01:14:28.311 --> 01:14:30.513]  Mary Ann and Tulsi out of there.
[01:14:30.513 --> 01:14:35.616]  And of course, Mary Ann is a complete, you know, loon in many respects.
[01:14:35.616 --> 01:14:43.943]  But still, they don't want her there either, because she keeps being number two in the polls.
[01:14:43.943 --> 01:14:45.744]  Because they're changing the subject.
[01:14:45.744 --> 01:14:49.767]  You think they want somebody up there saying your water's full of poison?
[01:14:49.767 --> 01:14:51.849]  The rich elites want to hurt you because you're black?
[01:14:51.849 --> 01:14:53.930]  Well, and she said because you're poor.
[01:14:53.930 --> 01:14:54.531]  It's actually true!
[01:14:55.629 --> 01:15:01.514]  They put hydrofluorosilicic acid in the water to lower your fertility and your IQ.
[01:15:01.514 --> 01:15:07.738]  Now, the average person doesn't know that, but people like Joe Biden do.
[01:15:07.738 --> 01:15:10.020]  But Joe Biden just went along for the power.
[01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:13.743]  He's just a smarty-pants lawyer from Maine.
[01:15:13.743 --> 01:15:21.369]  In fact, I know folks that know him, people that have vacationed with his family, people that live next door, people that sold him the property that there are bars on.
[01:15:21.369 --> 01:15:25.132]  I mean, I know multiple people that have known Joe Joe since he was a teenager.
[01:15:26.141 --> 01:15:34.166]  And they just say, mean, arrogant, saucy, follow himself.
[01:15:34.166 --> 01:15:38.229]  But is he as bad as the new generation of globalists?
[01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:38.889]  No.
[01:15:38.889 --> 01:15:42.091]  But he's not going to make it to the finish line, like Trump said.
[01:15:42.091 --> 01:15:44.353]  He thinks he's still the leader of the Democratic field.
[01:15:44.353 --> 01:15:48.455]  But if he can make it, I mean, that lightbulb's dimming by the minute.
[01:15:48.455 --> 01:15:51.537]  It kind of goes out for a minute, kind of comes back in when the lightbulb's going out.
[01:15:51.537 --> 01:15:53.459]  Gets real bright for a minute, kind of gets dark.
[01:15:53.459 --> 01:15:55.340]  I mean, it's about to go, and be gone.
[01:15:57.884 --> 01:16:08.930]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder, or legs, you now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill.

[01:16:59.117 --> 01:17:04.440]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:06.021]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:17:06.021 --> 01:17:14.386]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[01:17:58.339 --> 01:18:04.281]  George Orwell said that in a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[01:18:04.281 --> 01:18:07.282]  And so, used to it wasn't that important to wear the American flag.
[01:18:07.282 --> 01:18:11.484]  Because we still loved our country and there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it.
[01:18:11.484 --> 01:18:14.445]  But now, they're trying to take it out of schools.
[01:18:14.445 --> 01:18:16.666]  They're taking it down off of government buildings.
[01:18:16.666 --> 01:18:21.508]  Weird white leftists that want a virtue signal are pulling down American flags and running up Mexican flags.
[01:18:22.168 --> 01:18:25.069]  This is the bizarreness of the America hating we're seeing.
[01:18:25.069 --> 01:18:31.410]  So now it is a revolutionary act in a time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying to wear the American flag.
[01:18:31.410 --> 01:18:34.671]  Particularly the Betsy Ross anti-slavery flag.
[01:18:34.671 --> 01:18:41.172]  And particularly when it says on the back, right there ladies and gentlemen, America's back inpolwars.com.
[01:18:41.172 --> 01:18:46.413]  So whatever you do, take action today and exercise your free speech in these bullies' face.
[01:18:46.413 --> 01:18:48.493]  All over, not just the U.S., but worldwide.
[01:18:48.493 --> 01:18:51.754]  Because more than ever, the American flag is a symbol of freedom against globalism.
[01:18:58.168 --> 01:19:02.351]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[01:19:02.351 --> 01:19:03.412]  They are technocrats.
[01:19:03.412 --> 01:19:05.713]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[01:19:05.713 --> 01:19:13.078]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[01:19:13.078 --> 01:19:14.939]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[01:19:14.939 --> 01:19:17.041]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[01:19:17.541 --> 01:19:23.904]  One of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[01:19:23.904 --> 01:19:29.086]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[01:19:29.086 --> 01:19:38.091]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality, and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[01:19:39.071 --> 01:19:45.052]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[01:19:45.052 --> 01:19:45.992]  It is amazing.

[01:19:56.054 --> 01:19:57.755]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:28.624 --> 01:20:45.741]  So, an international terrorist organization with hundreds of millions of dollars of funding that's already firebombed ICE facilities and wounded hundreds of Americans with knives and clubs and hammers and crowbars.
[01:20:47.148 --> 01:20:56.351]  He's organizing nationwide terrorist operations and they intend to march on Texas and November 1st begin firebombing ICE facilities.
[01:20:56.351 --> 01:20:59.452]  They're funded by Alexander Soros publicly.
[01:20:59.452 --> 01:21:07.194]  Last hour, I provided all the documents, all the proof, all their internal memorandum, what police departments they're working with.
[01:21:07.194 --> 01:21:12.296]  And ladies and gentlemen, I don't even think they'll get arrested.
[01:21:12.296 --> 01:21:15.177]  Not even in Texas.
[01:21:15.177 --> 01:21:15.437]  Because
[01:21:17.116 --> 01:21:18.736]  They work for the deep state.
[01:21:18.736 --> 01:21:21.857]  And Trump hasn't even gotten control of the government yet.
[01:21:21.857 --> 01:21:23.338]  He's starting to, and that's why they're so scared.
[01:21:23.338 --> 01:21:26.318]  That's why we've got headlines like this.
[01:21:26.318 --> 01:21:30.279]  MSNBC, Trump wants to exterminate black people.
[01:21:30.279 --> 01:21:32.740]  That clip's coming up next segment.
[01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:36.181]  Max Boot, the big neocon, says when the U.S.
[01:21:36.181 --> 01:21:40.522]  becomes a majority-minority, the Trump era will be seen as the last gasp of white resistance.
[01:21:40.522 --> 01:21:46.043]  He goes on to say whites are inherently bad people and lazy and stupid, and so does this other neocon, Trotskyite.
[01:21:47.551 --> 01:21:50.632]  William Crystal, it's all in the article.
[01:21:50.632 --> 01:21:52.713]  These are the neocons.
[01:21:52.713 --> 01:21:57.154]  As if being white's bad, or wanting guns, or wanting free market, or not hating your country.
[01:21:57.154 --> 01:22:00.415]  But they're telling minorities, you hate America!
[01:22:00.415 --> 01:22:03.816]  You're for burning American flags!
[01:22:03.816 --> 01:22:06.857]  And it's the Republican and Democratic establishment, they're the ones pushing racism.
[01:22:06.857 --> 01:22:08.358]  It's unbelievable.
[01:22:08.358 --> 01:22:08.918]  Speaking of that,
[01:22:10.219 --> 01:22:14.880]  Tulsi Gabbard torched Camilla on criminal justice.
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:15.560]  We'll play the clip.
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:19.421]  She's like, you're calling Joe Biden racist?
[01:22:19.421 --> 01:22:28.562]  You were the prosecutor, the attorney general that would throw the book and get black people three times the sentences.
[01:22:28.562 --> 01:22:29.323]  And then it gets worse.
[01:22:29.323 --> 01:22:32.523]  It gets worse.
[01:22:32.523 --> 01:22:36.424]  Because she also supported the Clinton crime bill.
[01:22:38.911 --> 01:22:46.195]  So, oh, by the way, family's ultra wealthy from, guess what, Jamaica, mom.
[01:22:46.195 --> 01:22:49.217]  Oh, but there's never brown people on slaves.
[01:22:49.217 --> 01:22:52.878]  Okay, that's a good one right there.
[01:22:52.878 --> 01:22:53.759]  Better think again.
[01:22:53.759 --> 01:23:02.484]  But that's the history that I want you to know, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:02.484 --> 01:23:04.805]  Okay, let's go ahead and play Tulsi Gabbard.
[01:23:05.848 --> 01:23:13.631]  Senator Harris says she's proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she'll be a prosecutor president, but I'm deeply concerned about this record.
[01:23:13.631 --> 01:23:22.994]  There are too many examples to cite, but she put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.
[01:23:22.994 --> 01:23:23.954]  She blocked evidence.
[01:23:25.229 --> 01:23:32.292]  She blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so.
[01:23:32.292 --> 01:23:37.874]  She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of California.
[01:23:37.874 --> 01:23:44.637]  And she fought to keep the cash bail system in place that impacts poor people in the worst kind of way.
[01:23:45.077 --> 01:23:45.998]  Thank you, Congresswoman.
[01:23:45.998 --> 01:23:47.499]  Senator Harris, your response?
[01:23:47.499 --> 01:23:48.259]  I can't listen to Harris.
[01:23:48.259 --> 01:23:48.960]  You know what she says.
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:50.220]  I'm proud of being a prosecutor.
[01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:51.261]  I am tough.
[01:23:51.261 --> 01:23:52.082]  I just can't listen to it.
[01:23:52.082 --> 01:23:52.742]  You already heard it once.
[01:23:52.742 --> 01:23:54.783]  I'm not going to do it.
[01:23:54.783 --> 01:23:57.625]  Now, continuing.
[01:23:57.625 --> 01:24:02.308]  I was watching Juan Williams just yesterday morning.
[01:24:02.308 --> 01:24:05.170]  And he's making the rounds, not just on his own show, but all over the other shows.
[01:24:05.170 --> 01:24:07.032]  He's like, Trump's racist.
[01:24:07.032 --> 01:24:09.193]  Did Trump call black people rats?
[01:24:09.193 --> 01:24:10.394]  And the other hosts are like, no, he didn't.
[01:24:11.493 --> 01:24:14.716]  And then Juan Williams is like, yeah, well, what's he done?
[01:24:14.716 --> 01:24:16.798]  Well, criminal justice reform.
[01:24:16.798 --> 01:24:20.361]  He's trying to decriminalize marijuana more than Obama did.
[01:24:20.361 --> 01:24:21.342]  He goes, well, I'll give him that.
[01:24:21.342 --> 01:24:24.365]  But he called black people rats.
[01:24:24.365 --> 01:24:27.468]  You want somebody to get your ass out of jail and clean up the rats?
[01:24:27.468 --> 01:24:30.150]  And then, oh, he's calling me a rat.
[01:24:30.150 --> 01:24:35.155]  And by the way, I should have made a bigger deal about this because we first covered this.
[01:24:35.155 --> 01:24:37.177]  I mean, we were the first to cover this like a month ago.
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:43.689]  And then the President took notice of it, and I never covered it again.
[01:24:43.689 --> 01:24:47.376]  ASAP Rocky was the footage in Sweden that we covered a month ago.
[01:24:47.376 --> 01:24:47.816]  Remember this?
[01:24:48.871 --> 01:24:57.136]  Where you've got these three rappers and their big bodyguard, looks like he weighs 300 pounds, and there's these two little Islamic dudes following him, pushing him in their face.
[01:24:57.136 --> 01:24:59.018]  There's 30 minutes of footage.
[01:24:59.018 --> 01:25:01.239]  We played like 10 minutes of it.
[01:25:01.239 --> 01:25:18.170]  Finally, they start trying to slap and push, I'm talking 140 pound punks, a 300 pound black dude, and so, oh yeah, they also hit him, they also grabbed his headphones out of his pocket and slapped him across his face so hard,
[01:25:20.438 --> 01:25:22.080]  That the bodyguard was bleeding.
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:26.143]  Well, Rocky at that point gets pissed.
[01:25:26.143 --> 01:25:31.428]  Because, hey, his licensed bodyguard knows, I don't want to go to jail, so I don't want to fight.
[01:25:31.428 --> 01:25:42.498]  So this guy's letting these people slap him in the face, like bitches do, and hit him over the head with the earphones, headphones.
[01:25:42.498 --> 01:25:42.798]  And so,
[01:25:44.048 --> 01:25:51.651]  ASAP Rocky grabs them, slams them to the ground, punches them a few times, which I would have done, and leaves.
[01:25:51.651 --> 01:25:53.171]  I remember hearing that they had been arrested.
[01:25:53.171 --> 01:25:55.212]  The listeners back then didn't believe me.
[01:25:55.212 --> 01:25:57.272]  Because I don't know who ASAP Rocky is.
[01:25:57.272 --> 01:25:57.973]  I know he's popular.
[01:25:57.973 --> 01:26:00.253]  I know he likes Trump.
[01:26:00.253 --> 01:26:03.455]  And there's video of all this.
[01:26:03.455 --> 01:26:05.515]  Where they're hitting the bodyguard.
[01:26:05.515 --> 01:26:06.095]  But here's the deal.
[01:26:06.095 --> 01:26:07.436]  They're Muslims.
[01:26:07.436 --> 01:26:09.116]  This is a Swedish no-go zone.
[01:26:09.116 --> 01:26:09.837]  Paul Watson's like 6'4".
[01:26:11.578 --> 01:26:13.639]  Okay, so my other crew are big guys.
[01:26:13.639 --> 01:26:18.822]  They went to Belgium to a no-go zone, and they needed gas for the car, too.
[01:26:18.822 --> 01:26:20.162]  They were driving all over the town.
[01:26:20.162 --> 01:26:26.286]  Everywhere, Muslims said, get out of here, and started chasing their car.
[01:26:26.286 --> 01:26:30.608]  It's been mobs of people, because they were white.
[01:26:30.608 --> 01:26:32.049]  But see, it's not just if you're white.
[01:26:32.049 --> 01:26:34.250]  If you aren't their Islamic group,
[01:26:35.578 --> 01:26:40.680]  And they're in like a nice area where he was playing, in nice shops, and this goes on for 30 minutes.
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:44.121]  The raw footage is up on Infowars.com.
[01:26:44.121 --> 01:26:47.122]  And they finally are acknowledging these no-go zones.
[01:26:47.122 --> 01:26:50.443]  It's incredible, folks.
[01:26:50.443 --> 01:26:57.165]  And he's facing two years in prison, even though it's admitted that these guys hit them first.
[01:26:57.165 --> 01:27:03.267]  But see, they're not charging the big bodyguard, because he let them beat him.
[01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:12.541]  It's when A$AP Rocky gets pissed and starts kicking their ass, because this is going on, there's 30 minutes of it.
[01:27:12.541 --> 01:27:16.362]  They say it went on for an hour.
[01:27:16.362 --> 01:27:18.162]  As they follow him around.
[01:27:18.162 --> 01:27:19.843]  Because that's what little wimps do.
[01:27:19.843 --> 01:27:21.763]  And see, they knew the state is behind me.
[01:27:21.763 --> 01:27:27.324]  Because in Sweden, the Swedes are nice people, and tough too.
[01:27:27.324 --> 01:27:29.105]  The Romans had trouble conquering them.
[01:27:29.105 --> 01:27:30.445]  But now they're so domesticated,
[01:27:31.847 --> 01:27:33.549]  They're Vikings, folks.
[01:27:33.549 --> 01:27:43.902]  They're so domesticated that men will just sit there while their kids get beaten, and the Islamists will beat their wife and kids to death, and then the father watches while they throw them in the lake!
[01:27:43.902 --> 01:27:47.947]  And the father just sits there and they pee on themselves.
[01:27:47.947 --> 01:27:49.268]  Because the programming...
[01:27:50.251 --> 01:27:50.771]  I'm not kidding.
[01:27:50.771 --> 01:27:55.855]  There was one article where the father sat and urinated on himself.
[01:27:55.855 --> 01:27:59.878]  Because their whole culture in Europe is just worshipping.
[01:27:59.878 --> 01:28:01.620]  Oh, you're a Muslim.
[01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:05.082]  Oh, please let me bow to you.
[01:28:05.082 --> 01:28:08.144]  All of a sudden, here's the rappers walking down the street.
[01:28:08.144 --> 01:28:10.246]  People start following them like little roosters.
[01:28:10.246 --> 01:28:12.468]  Come up pecking at them.
[01:28:12.468 --> 01:28:18.752]  And finally, after all the slapping his bodyguard, grabbing his headphones, hitting him in the head, it's all on video, they finally beat their ass.
[01:28:18.752 --> 01:28:19.433]  Let's play that part.
[01:28:21.638 --> 01:28:25.804]  I mean, I wouldn't put up with any of that, and I'd be in jail!
[01:28:25.804 --> 01:28:30.310]  Grab my headphones, slap them across my head, I'm gonna knock your teeth out!
[01:28:30.310 --> 01:28:36.399]  And I'm gonna go to jail, because in Sweden, the state lets people go that rape five-year-old girls.
[01:28:36.399 --> 01:28:37.641]  They say, well in Islam you're allowed to.
[01:28:39.209 --> 01:28:42.974]  So they follow him into stores, messed with him, followed him out of the stores, messed with him.
[01:28:42.974 --> 01:28:44.636]  He goes off for 30-something minutes.
[01:28:44.636 --> 01:28:52.247]  They fight back, and that's the ultimate crime, is fighting back anyone that's Antifa, or Islamic, or part of the army of the New World Order.
[01:28:52.247 --> 01:28:53.548]  They are God.
[01:28:53.548 --> 01:28:54.730]  They are your ruler.
[01:28:54.730 --> 01:28:55.812]  Bow to them now!
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:28:58.741]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:58.741 --> 01:29:02.643]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:02.643 --> 01:29:04.185]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:29:04.185 --> 01:29:07.147]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:07.147 --> 01:29:12.710]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:12.710 --> 01:29:13.911]  I can help you, too.
[01:29:13.911 --> 01:29:16.853]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:29:16.853 --> 01:29:19.075]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:29:19.075 --> 01:29:23.518]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:23.518 --> 01:29:25.819]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:29:27.384 --> 01:29:28.645]  Maybe not today.
[01:29:28.645 --> 01:29:29.926]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:29:29.926 --> 01:29:33.669]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.

[01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:36.572]  You're not a live underground gopher.

[01:30:58.300 --> 01:30:58.700]  Oh, thank you.
[01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:30.820]  Well, sir, let me break this down for you.
[01:31:30.820 --> 01:31:32.301]  I want high-quality stuff in there.
[01:31:32.301 --> 01:31:33.361]  I want a good price.
[01:31:33.361 --> 01:31:37.462]  But I've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[01:31:37.462 --> 01:31:39.722]  I'm making $2 on my toothpaste 50% off.
[01:31:39.722 --> 01:31:43.303]  And so it's the same thing with, like, the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth.
[01:31:43.303 --> 01:31:44.443]  Thank you so much for the plug.
[01:31:44.443 --> 01:31:48.463]  Listen, when people get the Patriot Points, a lot of times it makes things a loss later.
[01:31:48.463 --> 01:31:56.145]  Because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto-ship, then we're doing 50% off, and then you do something like that, where you have Patriot Points, we lose money.
[01:31:56.145 --> 01:31:56.785]  But that's okay.
[01:31:56.785 --> 01:31:57.405]  Thanks for the support.
[01:31:57.947 --> 01:32:06.132]  Before I started working at InfoWars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and InfoWars.com, but also the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:32:06.132 --> 01:32:13.496]  And there's one product that's offered at InfoWarsStore.com that is the elite of the supplements, and that's DNA Force Plus.
[01:32:13.496 --> 01:32:17.018]  Now, I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests.
[01:32:17.418 --> 01:32:21.260]  Tellomeres and telomere support with your DNA.
[01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:29.684]  So I started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres.
[01:32:29.684 --> 01:32:33.105]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus but it's expensive.
[01:32:33.105 --> 01:32:33.425]  Why?
[01:32:33.425 --> 01:32:36.226]  Because it is an elite supplement.
[01:32:36.226 --> 01:32:41.369]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support.
[01:32:42.129 --> 01:32:44.250]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:20.055 --> 01:33:27.097]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.097 --> 01:33:31.999]  Okay, during the break a national well-known journalist, I'll just leave it at that, sent me a message.
[01:33:31.999 --> 01:33:34.699]  I looked it up, it's incredible.
[01:33:34.699 --> 01:33:37.700]  I'm catching my breath right now.
[01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:41.081]  I won't be ready to cover this till the start of the next segment.
[01:33:41.081 --> 01:33:45.243]  And that's not a cliffhanger, that's not me putting a hook out there to make you stay tuned.
[01:33:45.243 --> 01:33:48.304]  I am hyperventilating right now.
[01:33:48.304 --> 01:33:49.504]  Wow, this is...
[01:33:51.784 --> 01:33:52.805]  Over the top.
[01:33:52.805 --> 01:33:53.785]  I should probably take this call.
[01:33:53.785 --> 01:33:55.906]  This is from the White House.
[01:33:55.906 --> 01:34:04.131]  Let's just say... Stuff is definitely getting crazy right now.
[01:34:04.131 --> 01:34:06.532]  We need to push Joey Gibson back 15 minutes.
[01:34:06.532 --> 01:34:07.212]  I really want him on.
[01:34:07.212 --> 01:34:08.373]  He just got back from Hong Kong.
[01:34:11.638 --> 01:34:16.981]  Part of his family's from Asia, so he knows the lay of the land.
[01:34:16.981 --> 01:34:19.603]  He, of course, heads up the Patriot Prayer Group.
[01:34:19.603 --> 01:34:20.684]  He's an expert on antifas.
[01:34:20.684 --> 01:34:31.050]  He's a perfect guest for today, but I need to push him back, so we have time to get to calls, and so I have time to hit this next subject, next segment, because it's all coming together right now.
[01:34:31.050 --> 01:34:39.075]  In fact, I almost covered this Sunday, but I decided not to do it, because I knew where it was going next, and I have a prediction.
[01:34:41.397 --> 01:34:44.199]  I have a prediction.
[01:34:44.199 --> 01:34:49.461]  I was sure of it Sunday, but I just didn't want to sound like I was stirring up trouble.
[01:34:49.461 --> 01:34:51.683]  I've always got to go with my gut.
[01:34:51.683 --> 01:34:54.204]  Man.
[01:34:54.204 --> 01:34:58.246]  They're going to list Antifa as a terror group.
[01:34:58.246 --> 01:35:01.628]  And they're going to list Q as one as well.
[01:35:01.628 --> 01:35:04.249]  Like they already did.
[01:35:04.249 --> 01:35:05.090]  And they're going to connect it to me.
[01:35:07.979 --> 01:35:09.000]  Those people listen to me, man.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.360]  Nobody does.
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:12.561]  I cannot believe this.
[01:35:12.561 --> 01:35:13.561]  I'm getting a headache right now.
[01:35:13.561 --> 01:35:22.725]  I hate being right, man.
[01:35:22.725 --> 01:35:27.347]  They're gonna stage stuff and Q is the perfect cutout.
[01:35:27.347 --> 01:35:30.268]  Because they can have their operatives do it and then blame it on the movement.
[01:35:30.268 --> 01:35:33.810]  Anything anonymous like that is made to set people up.
[01:35:33.810 --> 01:35:36.091]  That's why I'm out in the open and what I stand for is clear.
[01:35:38.012 --> 01:35:46.519]  There's all these people that want to play along like they're part of a fortune cookie or Easter egg hunt or something.
[01:35:46.519 --> 01:35:49.962]  It's like that Pokemon game where you go around with a phone and find the Pokemons.
[01:35:49.962 --> 01:35:51.603]  It's just like, please, man.
[01:35:51.603 --> 01:35:55.807]  The whole world's going on in front of everybody.
[01:35:55.807 --> 01:36:00.551]  I think I've pretty much figured out how this stuff works by this point.
[01:36:00.551 --> 01:36:02.653]  I'm not judging you for being part of the Q thing.
[01:36:02.653 --> 01:36:04.634]  I'm not saying you're bad.
[01:36:04.634 --> 01:36:06.276]  But holy Toledo, you know my name.
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:10.681]  You know who I am, you know what I stand for, you know I'm under attack.
[01:36:10.681 --> 01:36:14.102]  You know Trump tweets out Infowars.
[01:36:14.102 --> 01:36:23.144]  Sarah Sanders has said they're not with Q. You know it's fun to say Q, Q, Q, Q, Q. See?
[01:36:23.144 --> 01:36:26.244]  Okay, I'm going to get to it.
[01:36:26.244 --> 01:36:29.245]  You know I'm not going to say what the news is until the start of the next hour.
[01:36:29.245 --> 01:36:33.486]  Because I need to take your calls like I said I do, and I need you to settle down a little bit, and not get angry.
[01:36:35.265 --> 01:36:53.457]  But man, I saw this this weekend, and I had all the clips ready, and I was going to make the prediction, going to ask the producers in there, because I was saying to myself, they're going to have anti-foot launch attacks, but how are they going to counterbalance that and make it look like there's a violent Republican opposition?
[01:36:53.457 --> 01:37:00.521]  And just as sure as dead people push daisies, I sat out on my back porch for an hour drinking
[01:37:01.926 --> 01:37:05.127]  Watching my daughter play in her little baby pool.
[01:37:05.127 --> 01:37:06.807]  Swimming pool.
[01:37:06.807 --> 01:37:10.648]  Little rubber plastic pool.
[01:37:10.648 --> 01:37:12.648]  And the light bulb went boop!
[01:37:12.648 --> 01:37:13.128]  Cue!
[01:37:13.128 --> 01:37:13.568]  Cue!
[01:37:13.568 --> 01:37:13.989]  Cue!
[01:37:13.989 --> 01:37:14.409]  Cue!
[01:37:14.409 --> 01:37:14.829]  Cue!
[01:37:14.829 --> 01:37:16.129]  Cue!
[01:37:16.129 --> 01:37:22.270]  Then I just sat here Sunday right before I went on air and I said, no, I'm not going to do that.
[01:37:22.270 --> 01:37:28.892]  Because people have already been brainwashed by it and they'll think I'm calling them an idiot.
[01:37:28.892 --> 01:37:30.332]  And maybe I'm wrong, but I'm not.
[01:37:35.377 --> 01:37:36.778]  Oh, boy.
[01:37:36.778 --> 01:37:38.299]  Oh, it's horrible.
[01:37:38.299 --> 01:37:40.920]  See, I opened the show with Antifa planning terror attacks.
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:43.061]  November 1st, they said they're going to start the terror attacks.
[01:37:43.061 --> 01:37:45.702]  The terror attacks have already begun.
[01:37:45.702 --> 01:37:58.687]  But they're going to stage death and blame it on Q. And the New York Times, when that schizophrenic went and killed the head of the Gambino crime family, had nothing to do with the Democrats.
[01:38:00.486 --> 01:38:02.907]  If you want to really get down to brass tacks, dumbasses.
[01:38:02.907 --> 01:38:06.729]  The New York Mafia probably supports Trump a lot more than they know anything.
[01:38:06.729 --> 01:38:17.475]  Anyways, the New York Times and a bunch of others think the Gambino crime family is so stupid that they try to act like I sent this guy to kill him.
[01:38:17.475 --> 01:38:20.836]  When you know who we think will probably be the type of person to put a bullet in me?
[01:38:20.836 --> 01:38:22.217]  What does my security think?
[01:38:22.217 --> 01:38:24.678]  The damn Q people!
[01:38:24.678 --> 01:38:27.640]  Because they're the perfect cut out of morons!
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:27.880]  Okay.
[01:38:29.161 --> 01:38:30.041]  I'm going to stop right now.
[01:38:30.041 --> 01:38:30.882]  I'm getting mad right now.
[01:38:30.882 --> 01:38:36.743]  I'm going to settle down right now.
[01:38:36.743 --> 01:38:37.964]  I'm mad at myself right now.
[01:38:37.964 --> 01:38:39.784]  I should have gone with this Sunday.
[01:38:39.784 --> 01:38:42.685]  I have a rule that I always go with my gut.
[01:38:42.685 --> 01:38:44.546]  When I was young I did it 10% of the time.
[01:38:44.546 --> 01:38:46.446]  Now I go with my gut 80% of the time.
[01:38:46.446 --> 01:38:50.387]  But dammit, I will follow my gut 100% of the time!
[01:38:50.387 --> 01:38:54.929]  From now on!
[01:38:54.929 --> 01:38:56.949]  Wait until you hear what happens next hour.
[01:38:56.949 --> 01:38:57.550]  I'm going to go on a break.
[01:38:57.550 --> 01:38:58.650]  I'm going to come back to your calls.
[01:38:59.912 --> 01:39:04.856]  Veteran, Border, Constitution, was it Bundy Ranch, Mike at FEMA Region X?
[01:39:04.856 --> 01:39:05.717]  That's 10 folks.
[01:39:05.717 --> 01:39:10.160]  Shannon in Texas, Chase the Patriot, was on hold the other day, I didn't get to him, I'll go to him first.
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:17.166]  Tom and Caleb and Josh and Judy and Tim and Mike, I'll get to you and then I'll get to this.
[01:39:17.166 --> 01:39:20.328]  I've really learned anger management better.
[01:39:20.328 --> 01:39:24.311]  It's fun to do, but then I'm exhausted afterwards and I apologize, I'm getting angry right now.
[01:39:24.311 --> 01:39:27.874]  I just, I can smell a setup a mile away, I know you can too.
[01:39:33.194 --> 01:39:35.615]  Just wait till I cover this next hour.
[01:39:35.615 --> 01:39:35.935]  Just wait.
[01:39:35.935 --> 01:39:41.197]  I always say I'm going to cover something, and I start covering it, but I haven't told you what it is yet.
[01:39:41.197 --> 01:39:42.758]  It's horrible.
[01:39:42.758 --> 01:39:44.259]  It's a big, giant national push.
[01:39:44.259 --> 01:39:47.160]  Any of you can figure it out if you go look.
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:49.581]  And they're breathing down everybody's necks, and this is it.
[01:39:49.581 --> 01:39:50.961]  This is going to be their move against Trump.
[01:39:50.961 --> 01:39:51.382]  I knew it.
[01:39:51.382 --> 01:39:56.484]  All right, we're going to go to break here in a moment.
[01:39:56.484 --> 01:39:58.425]  I promise I'm coming right back to your calls, so be ready.
[01:40:00.117 --> 01:40:12.901]  Please remember, we're doing a fundraiser right now, where we are having double Patriot Points, 50-60% off store-wide, and of course, store-wide free shipping.
[01:40:12.901 --> 01:40:16.582]  And, you know, we sold a lot of water filters yesterday, and that's great.
[01:40:16.582 --> 01:40:26.505]  We actually had a bigger day yesterday than the day before, because of them talking about poison in the water supply.
[01:40:26.505 --> 01:40:27.185]  And I'm like, yeah.
[01:40:28.584 --> 01:40:31.665]  We have the two highest rated brands, Alexa Pure and Pro Pure.
[01:40:31.665 --> 01:40:34.307]  Our apples and oranges, one's better at this, one's better at that.
[01:40:34.307 --> 01:40:36.447]  Hundreds and hundreds of chemicals they completely cut out.
[01:40:36.447 --> 01:40:40.769]  Thousands of chemicals they reduce to near undetectable levels.
[01:40:40.769 --> 01:40:48.653]  There's some spectrometers that can still find some, you know, 0.10th of a billion of something, so you can't say there's none of it in it.
[01:40:48.653 --> 01:40:57.637]  But whether you're on well water or whether you're on aquifer water, whatever it is, radioactive isotopes, bacteria, fluoride, you need these.
[01:40:58.789 --> 01:41:04.755]  And all of our systems, from the shower heads to you name it, are whatever the best is on the market you can get.
[01:41:04.755 --> 01:41:09.480]  There's always some weird Rolls Royce brand that's a little better that costs ten times more, okay?
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:15.947]  But I'm a prosumer type person that I just go out and research what I would buy, what's the best for the price, and I get it.
[01:41:15.947 --> 01:41:21.173]  Whether it's the storable food, whether it's water filtration, whether it's self-filtration, that's all massively discounted right now as well.
[01:41:22.955 --> 01:41:23.916]  Stop the clowns!
[01:41:23.916 --> 01:41:29.439]  Do you know how these distributors sell me air filters and water filters at cost during these specials?
[01:41:29.439 --> 01:41:30.800]  Only happens about twice a year.
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:37.104]  Because they can do such a bigger order when they manufacture, guaranteeing that I'm going to buy thousands of these, that it saves them money.
[01:41:37.104 --> 01:41:37.765]  That's how they do it.
[01:41:38.547 --> 01:41:40.749]  And then there are other distributors that don't know how to negotiate stuff.
[01:41:40.749 --> 01:41:42.210]  I guess they're not capitalists.
[01:41:42.210 --> 01:41:43.210]  Then other people get pissed.
[01:41:43.210 --> 01:41:44.431]  Why does Alex sell them so low?
[01:41:44.431 --> 01:41:46.513]  You got to stop him.
[01:41:46.513 --> 01:41:48.034]  We got the best on MyPatriot.
[01:41:48.034 --> 01:41:49.895]  We got the best on water filters you're going to find.
[01:41:49.895 --> 01:41:50.796]  Period!
[01:41:50.796 --> 01:41:55.539]  Because I'm a super capitalistic, right-wing, flame-throwing Texan.
[01:41:55.539 --> 01:41:57.420]  Okay?
[01:41:57.420 --> 01:41:58.501]  Continuing here.
[01:41:58.501 --> 01:42:00.843]  Stop the clown's store-wide mega-sale.
[01:42:00.843 --> 01:42:03.625]  50% off all InfoWars live.
[01:42:05.202 --> 01:42:06.984]  Formulas and free shipping and double patriot points.
[01:42:06.984 --> 01:42:09.946]  That means instead of 5 cents on every dollar on the next order, 10 cents.
[01:42:09.946 --> 01:42:12.708]  And you sign up for auto-ship, additional 10% off.
[01:42:12.708 --> 01:42:17.052]  We brought back the mega special to help you support InfoWars in stopping the new clown world.
[01:42:17.052 --> 01:42:22.837]  50% off on all InfoWars live formulas, free shipping, double patriot points and more.
[01:42:22.837 --> 01:42:27.441]  This could be your last chance to stock up on InfoWars live formulas before they're completely out of stock.
[01:42:28.365 --> 01:42:29.785]  And I'll just be honest with you about that.
[01:42:29.785 --> 01:42:31.766]  That means I've got to fund this.
[01:42:31.766 --> 01:42:32.846]  We're just not ever going to reorder it.
[01:42:32.846 --> 01:42:36.186]  I'll just sell out everything we've got for the next year and keep operating that way.
[01:42:36.186 --> 01:42:37.887]  We've got lots of ways to keep operating.
[01:42:37.887 --> 01:42:43.408]  The warehouse has confirmed we are already selling out of Survival Zone X2, Survival Vitality, and DNA Force.
[01:42:43.408 --> 01:42:46.508]  Now is the time to secure your order before they completely sell out.
[01:42:46.508 --> 01:42:51.029]  Take advantage of these massive sales and support free speech and liberty today.
[01:42:51.029 --> 01:42:52.349]  Huge deals on water filters.
[01:42:52.349 --> 01:42:53.410]  Huge deals on air filters.
[01:42:53.410 --> 01:42:54.250]  Everything.
[01:42:54.250 --> 01:42:54.690]  Take action.
[01:42:57.512 --> 01:43:03.476]  Last night, I'm on Infowars.com, and I read, Chris Pratt criticized for t-shirt choice.
[01:43:03.476 --> 01:43:06.978]  It is literally the shirt that I envisioned.
[01:43:06.978 --> 01:43:13.602]  A Betsy Ross, but also another just classic American flag, all 50 stars, with the Gadsden snake superimposed over it.
[01:43:13.602 --> 01:43:16.443]  And on the back, America's back, Infowars.com.
[01:43:16.443 --> 01:43:17.944]  But what's better than just an American flag?
[01:43:17.944 --> 01:43:19.985]  How about a, don't tread on me, under the flag?
[01:43:19.985 --> 01:43:21.066]  Say, don't tread on the American flag.
[01:43:21.186 --> 01:43:22.026]  It's a perfect combo.
[01:43:22.026 --> 01:43:23.067]  So great minds think alike.
[01:43:23.067 --> 01:43:26.828]  I mean, whoever designed that shirt, we'd already come up with the exact same, similar design.
[01:43:26.828 --> 01:43:34.310]  It is the Don't Tread on Me American Flag T-shirt, inspired by the triggering of leftists of the shirt worn by Chris Pratt.
[01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:37.812]  But it's a battle-tattered flag, like the one that flew over Fort Sumter.
[01:43:37.812 --> 01:43:41.893]  And again, on the back, it says, America's Back, Infowars.com.
[01:43:43.234 --> 01:43:45.075]  4,000 of these babies.
[01:43:45.075 --> 01:43:45.595]  And that's it.
[01:43:45.595 --> 01:43:52.520]  So we've got the Betsy Ross version and the American flag version at InfoWarsTore.com being printed in the USA right now.
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:53.561]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:43:53.561 --> 01:43:54.561]  We'll be right back.
[01:43:54.561 --> 01:43:56.523]  The most banned broadcast in the world.
[01:43:59.227 --> 01:44:03.831]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.

[01:45:14.570 --> 01:45:16.292]  It is completely independent of all that.
[01:45:16.292 --> 01:45:23.156]  It is an old-school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of the press and freedom of speech.
[01:45:23.156 --> 01:45:27.178]  That, in fact, the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to
[01:45:27.378 --> 01:45:28.359]  We're good to go.
[01:45:47.196 --> 01:45:47.877]  I don't know.
[01:45:58.388 --> 01:46:09.615]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists are backed into a corner, and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[01:46:09.615 --> 01:46:13.757]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[01:46:13.757 --> 01:46:23.123]  The world is going to change, and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails.
[01:46:23.843 --> 01:46:25.865]  The system is vulnerable.
[01:46:25.865 --> 01:46:28.548]  Electricity could be gone in an instant.
[01:46:28.548 --> 01:46:32.191]  And grocery stores could be empty in three days.

[01:46:39.097 --> 01:46:44.443]  And being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a dying system.

[01:47:01.317 --> 01:47:03.999]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:20.561]  Big Brother.
[01:47:20.561 --> 01:47:22.362]  Mainstream media.
[01:47:22.362 --> 01:47:24.243]  Government cover-ups.
[01:47:24.243 --> 01:47:25.964]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:47:25.964 --> 01:47:27.625]  Well, so does he.
[01:47:27.625 --> 01:47:32.448]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:32.448 --> 01:47:35.710]  Standby from command for orders.
[01:47:35.710 --> 01:47:37.611]  Transmission incoming.
[01:47:37.611 --> 01:47:38.932]  Be in attack formation.
[01:47:42.745 --> 01:47:45.246]  Stay in attack formation.
[01:47:45.246 --> 01:47:47.007]  All right, we're going to your phone calls right now.
[01:47:47.007 --> 01:47:51.668]  Chase the Patriot, Dom, Shannon, Mike, Caleb, Josh, Judy, Tim, Joe, and Mike.
[01:47:51.668 --> 01:47:52.408]  And that's enough.
[01:47:52.408 --> 01:47:52.889]  Only ten.
[01:47:52.889 --> 01:47:54.249]  I'm going to get to all of them.
[01:47:54.249 --> 01:47:55.409]  I can't get to 20 or 30 or 40.
[01:47:55.409 --> 01:47:57.710]  I want to get to everybody.
[01:47:57.710 --> 01:47:59.751]  It just always makes me mad when I don't get to all of them.
[01:47:59.751 --> 01:48:01.151]  Chase the Patriot in California.
[01:48:01.151 --> 01:48:01.712]  You're on the air.
[01:48:01.712 --> 01:48:02.212]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:48:02.212 --> 01:48:02.712]  Thanks for calling.
[01:48:03.632 --> 01:48:03.872]  Great.
[01:48:03.872 --> 01:48:05.273]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:48:05.273 --> 01:48:08.354]  And Anne, I want to just give you a little positive information and energy.
[01:48:08.354 --> 01:48:10.395]  You were a little stressed out, it looked like there.
[01:48:10.395 --> 01:48:13.397]  You know, there's a lot of us that have been inspired by what you do.
[01:48:13.397 --> 01:48:18.559]  And since that reporter challenge last year, I still make my videos and I still try to get my voice out there.
[01:48:18.559 --> 01:48:21.721]  So I want to thank you for doing that to get me going.
[01:48:21.721 --> 01:48:25.623]  But there's a really interesting topic today off of Fox Business.
[01:48:25.623 --> 01:48:31.706]  It's another example of tomorrow's news today coming from InfoWars, because we're seeing Epstein, the whole Epstein case.
[01:48:32.139 --> 01:48:42.265]  And now they're talking about he was hiring Harvard scientists to bioengineer his own human race, and they're bringing up words like transhumanism and eugenics.
[01:48:42.265 --> 01:48:48.449]  I mean, this is exactly what you've been talking about for many years, and now it's finally out there in the mainstream media.
[01:48:48.449 --> 01:48:54.733]  We're finally seeing it in the normal news cycle, and it's just another example again of tomorrow's news today.
[01:48:54.733 --> 01:48:56.894]  I'll be talking about this on my livestream.
[01:48:56.894 --> 01:48:58.375]  You gotta check it out, Alex.
[01:48:58.375 --> 01:49:00.457]  10 o'clock Pacific Time on YouTube every day.
[01:49:00.457 --> 01:49:01.017]  I go live.
[01:49:03.444 --> 01:49:04.465]  Very exciting, brother.
[01:49:04.465 --> 01:49:05.105]  God bless you.
[01:49:05.105 --> 01:49:05.526]  Keep it up.
[01:49:05.526 --> 01:49:06.927]  Chase the Patriot.
[01:49:06.927 --> 01:49:08.888]  All right, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:49:08.888 --> 01:49:23.600]  Let's talk to Tom, Active Duty Police in Texas on Antifa and openly launching terror, planning terror and saying they're organizing nationwide to caravan and that November 1st they plan to start launching attacks.
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:26.202]  What do you make of this?
[01:49:26.202 --> 01:49:27.864]  Thank you for taking my call, first of all.
[01:49:29.813 --> 01:49:32.174]  You know, I'm a lifelong Texan.
[01:49:32.174 --> 01:49:38.415]  My family came here before, just barely after 1800, roughly.
[01:49:38.415 --> 01:49:39.856]  My family fought for this land.
[01:49:39.856 --> 01:49:42.036]  They gave blood and they died for it.
[01:49:42.036 --> 01:49:43.477]  Okay?
[01:49:43.477 --> 01:49:46.378]  Now, I know you and your history and everything else, so you'll understand.
[01:49:46.378 --> 01:49:48.658]  Same deal, my friend.
[01:49:48.658 --> 01:49:49.899]  Absolutely.
[01:49:49.899 --> 01:49:50.719]  I'm a Texan.
[01:49:50.719 --> 01:49:51.739]  I'm a police officer.
[01:49:51.739 --> 01:49:53.079]  I'm a God-fearing Christian.
[01:49:53.079 --> 01:49:54.740]  I am sick and tired.
[01:49:55.612 --> 01:50:00.795]  Of hearing, I'm the devil, I'm bad, I'm evil, we can't fly an American flag.
[01:50:00.795 --> 01:50:14.021]  But we can take out newspaper ads that say we're going to put our flag on the ground, raise the Mexican flag, and burn this place to the ground and cause all kinds of anarchy, but we're the bad people?
[01:50:14.021 --> 01:50:17.062]  Alex, I see this on a daily basis.
[01:50:17.062 --> 01:50:24.086]  In the area where I'm at alone, over 20% of our locked up inmates are illegal gang members.
[01:50:25.307 --> 01:50:27.669]  This place is going down.
[01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:31.172]  If anybody who can hear my voice is not prepared, you better be.
[01:50:31.172 --> 01:50:35.416]  I'm not, I'm like you, I'm not calling for violence or anything else.
[01:50:35.416 --> 01:50:42.302]  But I'm telling you, get out into the country, get away from the crowds, and you better be able to defend yourself.
[01:50:42.302 --> 01:50:45.124]  Because if they're putting this in newspapers, they're not playing.
[01:50:45.124 --> 01:50:49.208]  We've already seen what they'll do, and we better be prepared, is all I'm trying to say.
[01:50:50.794 --> 01:50:51.375]  Well, that's right.
[01:50:51.375 --> 01:50:58.402]  You're not going to have the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Endowment, or the Rockefeller Foundation, or the Soros Open Societies Group themselves do it.
[01:50:58.402 --> 01:51:12.396]  They're just going to run full-page ads in the New York Times saying, overthrow the government starting in November, and now another November comes by, and on their official site, they're literally saying, we're going to liberate and storm, and what's are the terms they use?
[01:51:13.217 --> 01:51:25.103]  We're going to have a militancy training tour where we lay siege to ICE facilities and they show ICE officers in pools of blood, burning vehicles, and the American flag on fire.
[01:51:25.103 --> 01:51:26.924]  That is 2019.
[01:51:26.924 --> 01:51:30.086]  And they just firebombed a facility three weeks ago.
[01:51:30.086 --> 01:51:31.006]  That's my whole point.
[01:51:31.006 --> 01:51:33.087]  I have friends who are ICE officers.
[01:51:33.087 --> 01:51:36.669]  I know people down on the border that do that job.
[01:51:36.669 --> 01:51:40.551]  They go to work and they kiss their wives like they may not come home that day.
[01:51:40.551 --> 01:51:42.272]  It's the most dangerous job in law enforcement.
[01:51:42.904 --> 01:51:43.905]  This is America.
[01:51:43.905 --> 01:51:46.167]  We should not have to worry about this.
[01:51:46.167 --> 01:51:48.189]  My family worried for me whenever I leave.
[01:51:48.189 --> 01:51:49.750]  Well what you're saying is it's a two-front war.
[01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:55.455]  You got to go out your front door and not never get hit by a car or stabbed or run over or catch some disease now.
[01:51:55.455 --> 01:51:57.336]  Typhus, the LAPD's getting that.
[01:51:57.336 --> 01:52:00.299]  And then you've got to be thought of as an enemy.
[01:52:00.299 --> 01:52:01.280]  I love my state.
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:02.801]  I love my country.
[01:52:02.801 --> 01:52:05.824]  And I love my people.
[01:52:05.824 --> 01:52:08.646]  We need to stand up for what is important.
[01:52:09.525 --> 01:52:10.765]  Political correctness is over.
[01:52:10.765 --> 01:52:12.306]  This is what got us to this point.
[01:52:12.306 --> 01:52:17.067]  I'm tired of being nice, but unfortunately with my job, I have to toe a line.
[01:52:17.067 --> 01:52:19.128]  And that's why we've got to get leadership in.
[01:52:19.128 --> 01:52:24.709]  We have to be politically incorrect on purpose, but all of us together, and we need to start pushing back.
[01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:28.230]  See, we don't want to control people's lives or tell other people how to do this or that.
[01:52:28.230 --> 01:52:30.350]  That's why I go to city council and get in their face.
[01:52:30.350 --> 01:52:32.071]  I go to state reps and get in their face.
[01:52:32.071 --> 01:52:35.992]  I go to the Congress and get right in Google's face and Facebook's face and Twitter's face.
[01:52:36.312 --> 01:52:37.333]  And you know, I don't want to do that.
[01:52:37.333 --> 01:52:40.535]  I think I want to march into Congress and start yelling at people.
[01:52:40.535 --> 01:52:41.115]  But you know what?
[01:52:41.115 --> 01:52:41.856]  We have to do it.
[01:52:41.856 --> 01:52:44.017]  God bless you.
[01:52:44.017 --> 01:52:44.778]  It's come down to that.
[01:52:44.778 --> 01:52:46.399]  They've been bullying us long enough.
[01:52:46.399 --> 01:52:48.260]  We didn't start this, so we're not the bullies.
[01:52:48.260 --> 01:52:49.841]  You know, it's all over the news.
[01:52:49.841 --> 01:52:51.482]  Oh, Alex is a bully.
[01:52:51.482 --> 01:52:53.683]  Oh, you know, I'm not the bully.
[01:52:53.683 --> 01:52:55.204]  I'm the person standing up to bullies.
[01:52:55.204 --> 01:52:55.945]  You're absolutely right, though.
[01:52:55.945 --> 01:52:57.766]  Thank you, sir.
[01:52:57.766 --> 01:52:58.787]  Shannon in Texas.
[01:52:58.787 --> 01:52:59.127]  Go ahead.
[01:52:59.127 --> 01:53:00.067]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:53:00.067 --> 01:53:02.909]  Mr. Jones, how you doing, sir?
[01:53:02.909 --> 01:53:04.930]  Good, my friend.
[01:53:04.930 --> 01:53:05.191]  Good.
[01:53:05.191 --> 01:53:05.731]  Hey, listen.
[01:53:06.523 --> 01:53:14.429]  I real quick, before I get to my point, I wanted to say, you know, the best way to drain this swamp is to move the United States Capitol out of Washington, D.C.
[01:53:14.429 --> 01:53:16.610]  There is nothing that says that it has to be there.
[01:53:16.610 --> 01:53:24.596]  If Trump would start moving department by department to rural Texas, rural Oklahoma, rural state, those people aren't going to come here.
[01:53:24.596 --> 01:53:32.122]  Well, he can certainly move the agency's buildings out of there, but there is acts of Congress and law on the District of Columbia.
[01:53:32.122 --> 01:53:35.284]  Yeah, but a lot of these, they're not even constitutional departments.
[01:53:36.616 --> 01:53:39.999]  Well, that's an even better idea is just to abolish them.
[01:53:39.999 --> 01:53:40.880]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:45.524]  Or send the administration of the states.
[01:53:45.524 --> 01:53:47.886]  Exactly.
[01:53:47.886 --> 01:53:53.210]  I was going to say that, you know, Obama called for a civilian army.
[01:53:53.210 --> 01:53:54.732]  It was going to be well-funded.
[01:53:54.732 --> 01:54:00.256]  You know, and a lot of the stimulus money that he spent, it didn't go to infrastructure like he said it was going to.
[01:54:00.256 --> 01:54:03.299]  You know, it went to different groups and different things to fund
[01:54:04.305 --> 01:54:04.745]  I don't know.
[01:54:16.798 --> 01:54:18.498]  A bigger plan than what we even realized.
[01:54:18.498 --> 01:54:18.958]  Oh, they do.
[01:54:18.958 --> 01:54:19.359]  God bless you.
[01:54:19.359 --> 01:54:20.419]  I appreciate your call.
[01:54:20.419 --> 01:54:21.539]  Joe is in Texas.
[01:54:21.539 --> 01:54:24.060]  A lot of calls in Texas because Antifa says, you just joined us.
[01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:29.001]  The article's on Infowars.com with links right to the big national site that can buy $150,000 ads in the New York Times.
[01:54:29.001 --> 01:54:34.582]  They're saying they're going to lay siege to federal installations.
[01:54:34.582 --> 01:54:37.282]  Last time the South did that, we had a civil war.
[01:54:37.282 --> 01:54:39.723]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[01:54:39.723 --> 01:54:42.604]  And Joe points out Antifa promoted on TV shows, Netflix.
[01:54:42.604 --> 01:54:44.244]  Yeah, I barely watch entertainment.
[01:54:44.997 --> 01:54:47.700]  But I scan what's in the entertainment news so I see the trailers.
[01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:51.104]  They've got CBS shows about punch a Trump supporter.
[01:54:51.104 --> 01:54:54.027]  They've got shows about Antifa being heroes everywhere.
[01:54:54.027 --> 01:54:57.491]  And so, again, Hollywood doesn't want to do the killing themselves.
[01:54:57.491 --> 01:55:01.776]  They're trying to get useful idiot morons to go out and do it for them.
[01:55:01.776 --> 01:55:05.280]  Joe, what are you seeing on Netflix and TV shows?
[01:55:06.275 --> 01:55:06.956]  Hey, Alex.
[01:55:06.956 --> 01:55:09.638]  Yeah, there's this really popular show on Netflix right now.
[01:55:09.638 --> 01:55:14.082]  I think if you just log into Netflix, they have all the super popular suggestions and stuff.
[01:55:14.082 --> 01:55:23.530]  And there's this Spanish show that's taken everybody by storm now called Money Heist, which is basically about a bunch of globalists and socialists who are robbing the Spanish government.
[01:55:23.530 --> 01:55:27.434]  And in this latest new season, they put up they're robbing
[01:55:28.157 --> 01:55:30.239]  Let me just stop you.
[01:55:30.239 --> 01:55:33.462]  I haven't seen this show, but what's the name of it again?
[01:55:49.201 --> 01:55:50.101]  Money heist.
[01:55:50.101 --> 01:55:50.842]  Money heist.
[01:55:50.842 --> 01:55:57.624]  Because you understand, I know you know this, Facebook and Google were set up to cause mass riots and overthrow governments.
[01:55:57.624 --> 01:55:59.504]  The weaponized test was the Arab Spring.
[01:55:59.504 --> 01:56:01.065]  So that's mainstream news.
[01:56:01.065 --> 01:56:09.547]  They're now using this Area 51 thing as a beta test to go, oh, Facebook lets him get 1.8 million people now that are going to attack this installation.
[01:56:09.547 --> 01:56:11.588]  And of course, nothing will end up happening with that probably.
[01:56:12.068 --> 01:56:18.191]  But this is just to get everyone trained and everyone ready to understand kind of what the game plan is, but that's it.
[01:56:18.191 --> 01:56:32.298]  They plan to do an Arab Spring that Al Gore called for, with Islamists involved, Hezbollah, MS-13, and the Democrats, and they're trying to have all these shows so the average leftist watches this and believes they can carry it out themselves.
[01:56:32.298 --> 01:56:37.260]  Yeah, exactly, and it's just, it's also hilariously ironic that Spain is one of the most socialist
[01:56:38.446 --> 01:56:50.483]  Uh, governments in the West and in the world and that their, their TV programs are saying, oh, we got to go rob all the banks, but don't you guys already have like 25% free salary and all that jazz?
[01:56:50.483 --> 01:56:52.846]  Yeah, Spain has a communist president.
[01:56:53.857 --> 01:56:54.297]  Yeah.
[01:56:54.297 --> 01:56:58.079]  Spain has a first communist president ever.
[01:56:58.079 --> 01:56:59.320]  And they had the Spanish Civil War with that.
[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:00.760]  He is a communist.
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:01.981]  Trump wouldn't talk to him.
[01:57:01.981 --> 01:57:04.022]  Balasaro wouldn't talk to him.
[01:57:04.022 --> 01:57:05.583]  And yeah, exactly.
[01:57:05.583 --> 01:57:10.365]  Oh, but they think the average Spanish person is so dumb in Spain that they're watching this.
[01:57:10.365 --> 01:57:15.908]  We have a communist government that won't let Catalonia leave.
[01:57:15.908 --> 01:57:20.490]  But oh, the socialists are fighting the socialists in the show.
[01:57:20.490 --> 01:57:21.071]  God bless you.
[01:57:21.071 --> 01:57:21.511]  Great points.
[01:57:23.351 --> 01:57:24.611]  Yeah.
[01:57:24.611 --> 01:57:28.793]  Anytime, any show I watch on Netflix, it's white people are the devil, communism's good.
[01:57:28.793 --> 01:57:30.233]  I mean, I can't even watch TV anymore.
[01:57:30.233 --> 01:57:32.854]  It's just nothing but propaganda.
[01:57:32.854 --> 01:57:38.596]  And I can't watch any movie with Robert De Niro, the little five-foot-tall tough guy, because, you know, he's a piece of crap.
[01:57:38.596 --> 01:57:41.217]  Can't go watch that new Scorsese movie.
[01:57:41.217 --> 01:57:45.099]  I'm sure it'll be good, but still, it's all ruined, because these people are scum!
[01:57:47.250 --> 01:57:47.930]  David Knight here.
[01:57:47.930 --> 01:57:50.851]  You can join me every Monday through Friday at 9 a.m.
[01:57:50.851 --> 01:57:51.951]  Eastern, 8 a.m.
[01:57:51.951 --> 01:57:54.392]  Central Time for The David Knight Show.
[01:57:54.392 --> 01:58:06.995]  We have the first independent news as it breaks every morning, but we'll not only give you the news, we'll give you the background, the context behind that news from a perspective that values our God-given liberties.
[01:58:07.415 --> 01:58:15.341]  We're going to take a look at those who want to do a detour around our Constitution, those who want to deconstruct our culture and destroy our civilization.
[01:58:15.341 --> 01:58:18.924]  So make sure you join us every Monday through Friday again, 9 a.m.
[01:58:18.924 --> 01:58:20.526]  Eastern, 8 a.m.
[01:58:20.526 --> 01:58:21.086]  Central Time.
[01:58:21.086 --> 01:58:25.990]  You can find the program on Infowars.com forward slash David dash night dash show.
[01:58:25.990 --> 01:58:30.033]  You can also find us on YouTube at Liberty Terrian and on Twitter.
[01:58:30.033 --> 01:58:33.015]  Live broadcast both of those places again, 9 a.m.
[01:58:33.015 --> 01:58:34.296]  Eastern, 8 a.m.
[01:58:34.296 --> 01:58:34.837]  Central Time.
[01:58:35.017 --> 01:58:40.390]  Again, don't forget to tune in to the David Knight Show on InfoWars.com forward slash David-Knight-Show.
[01:58:48.473 --> 01:58:49.794]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[01:58:49.794 --> 01:58:50.534]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[01:58:50.534 --> 01:58:51.155]  Thanks for holding.
[01:58:51.155 --> 01:58:51.675]  Hey, Alex.
[01:58:51.675 --> 01:58:54.497]  Yeah, I just want to say, uh, your show is a breath of fresh air.
[01:58:54.497 --> 01:59:00.621]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[01:59:00.621 --> 01:59:08.746]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public.
[01:59:08.746 --> 01:59:09.307]  The approaching 2020.
[01:59:09.307 --> 01:59:10.007]  That's it.
[01:59:10.007 --> 01:59:13.229]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[01:59:13.229 --> 01:59:16.091]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[01:59:16.091 --> 01:59:17.372]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[01:59:17.532 --> 01:59:18.292]  I agree entirely.
[01:59:18.292 --> 01:59:23.736]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[01:59:23.736 --> 01:59:26.497]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[01:59:26.497 --> 01:59:28.578]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[01:59:28.578 --> 01:59:37.844]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[01:59:37.844 --> 01:59:39.745]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[01:59:39.745 --> 01:59:46.208]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[01:59:46.208 --> 01:59:47.149]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[01:59:50.740 --> 01:59:55.464]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:59:55.464 --> 01:59:57.867]  Do it!
[02:00:17.606 --> 02:00:19.446]  I'm here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:00:19.446 --> 02:00:20.047]  to 3 p.m.
[02:00:20.047 --> 02:00:20.747]  Central.
[02:00:20.747 --> 02:00:23.067]  Back Sundays, 4, 6 p.m.
[02:00:23.067 --> 02:00:23.367]  Central.
[02:00:23.367 --> 02:00:27.328]  But then, don't forget weekdays, David Knight and the David Knight Show.
[02:00:27.328 --> 02:00:29.248]  That's 8 a.m.
[02:00:29.248 --> 02:00:31.149]  to 11 a.m.
[02:00:31.149 --> 02:00:36.130]  Amazing transmission, very cerebral, very in-depth, very focused, very researched.
[02:00:36.130 --> 02:00:43.331]  And then, The War Room, with that Tasmanian devil, Owen Schroyer, and more.
[02:00:43.331 --> 02:00:45.572]  3 to 6 p.m.
[02:00:45.572 --> 02:00:47.112]  Central Standard Time.
[02:00:52.028 --> 02:00:56.191]  You know, I'm sure of my analysis now.
[02:00:56.191 --> 02:01:02.675]  And you know, it's probably best I didn't do this Sunday because I wanted to be sure.
[02:01:02.675 --> 02:01:08.679]  But I also don't like to wait till I see exactly what I know is about to happen, happen.
[02:01:08.679 --> 02:01:20.367]  Like watching big thunderstorms across the lake and then they come across, see the rain, you're standing out in your backyard and you know right as it comes, 100 yards, 50 yards, 20 yards, the rain's pouring down on you.
[02:01:24.028 --> 02:01:29.412]  I'll talk about it next segment.
[02:01:29.412 --> 02:01:33.394]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to Mike in FEMA Region 10.
[02:01:33.394 --> 02:01:46.043]  He wants to talk about this whole situation with Antifa publicly organizing with Soros funding to carry out terror attacks against ICE facilities November 1st.
[02:01:46.043 --> 02:01:51.006]  Hey Alex, I'm a 30-year veteran, United States Army, active in reserve.
[02:01:51.710 --> 02:01:54.030]  I held a TSSCI clearance.
[02:01:54.030 --> 02:01:57.311]  I was badged to go into Cheyenne Mountain, if you know where that is in Colorado State.
[02:01:57.311 --> 02:01:57.591]  I do.
[02:01:57.591 --> 02:02:00.672]  That's the real shadow government.
[02:02:00.672 --> 02:02:02.392]  Well, there's a lot of good patriotic Americans.
[02:02:02.392 --> 02:02:02.792]  No, I understand.
[02:02:02.792 --> 02:02:07.953]  No, it's the COG, the real shadow government for nuclear attack, not the fake globalist shadow government.
[02:02:07.953 --> 02:02:09.253]  Well, let me explain.
[02:02:09.253 --> 02:02:14.274]  I was in Bunkerville in 2014 as a person with that clearance.
[02:02:14.274 --> 02:02:15.835]  I was on the ground, boots on the ground.
[02:02:15.835 --> 02:02:17.095]  I had a reason to be there.
[02:02:18.309 --> 02:02:30.038]  There's probably a reason the other side didn't shoot us because it would have been a very embarrassing episode for the Obama administration to have a commissioned officer with that clearance shot and killed on the scene.
[02:02:30.038 --> 02:02:32.219]  So just consider that.
[02:02:32.219 --> 02:02:39.804]  Hold on, I may even hold you over in need because I need to get to this and a guess, but explain what's happening, this specific event you're talking about.
[02:02:39.804 --> 02:02:45.589]  Well, I'm going to be down, and I know you've got Joey Gibson holding, I'm going to be down in Portland on August 17th.
[02:02:46.770 --> 02:02:50.592]  It's time for veterans to stand up, who support and defend the Constitution.
[02:02:50.592 --> 02:02:55.153]  But, one thing that you need to understand, the schools don't teach the Constitution.
[02:02:55.153 --> 02:03:03.197]  So when you go in the military and you raise your right hand and you swear your oath to the Constitution, if you don't know what's in the Constitution, how do you have an oath to it?
[02:03:03.197 --> 02:03:10.780]  In 1928, there was a training manual, November of 28, that taught citizenship to every person in the military.
[02:03:10.780 --> 02:03:12.641]  You can look it up yourself.
[02:03:12.641 --> 02:03:15.682]  There is an executive order in the Department of Defense, right now,
[02:03:16.474 --> 02:03:20.776]  Or President Trump to sign, to teach constitutional law to every person in the military.
[02:03:20.776 --> 02:03:21.056]  That's right.
[02:03:21.056 --> 02:03:21.856]  It needs to be done.
[02:03:21.856 --> 02:03:25.078]  You're saying you were there at the whole Bundy situation.
[02:03:25.078 --> 02:03:29.039]  I know they had active duty military that Obama was trying to use against them.
[02:03:29.039 --> 02:03:32.941]  That only happened, I guess, to a certain extent.
[02:03:32.941 --> 02:03:33.281]  Yeah.
[02:03:33.281 --> 02:03:34.222]  I ran into David Knight.
[02:03:34.222 --> 02:03:35.102]  I was boots on the ground.
[02:03:35.102 --> 02:03:38.864]  I was standing right in front of the stage when Clive and Bundy was talking.
[02:03:38.864 --> 02:03:39.564]  I saw the whole thing.
[02:03:42.910 --> 02:03:48.895]  And part of it was because I wanted to know who was in our government and who was going to take away my clearance.
[02:03:48.895 --> 02:03:51.217]  Just for being there as an American citizen.
[02:03:51.217 --> 02:03:51.857]  Okay?
[02:03:51.857 --> 02:03:52.838]  It never happened.
[02:03:52.838 --> 02:04:01.585]  Although people in the intelligence community would do a little, I guess, jokes, insinuations that they knew that I was there, but nobody ever said anything.
[02:04:01.585 --> 02:04:03.106]  I ended up retiring.
[02:04:03.106 --> 02:04:07.489]  I served from Carter through the president administration.
[02:04:07.489 --> 02:04:09.411]  That's how many administrations I served under.
[02:04:09.411 --> 02:04:09.551]  Wow.
[02:04:12.788 --> 02:04:17.749]  I just thought, you know, I heard you a little bit upset and, you know, down.
[02:04:17.749 --> 02:04:19.610]  No, there are a lot of patriots out there.
[02:04:19.610 --> 02:04:29.452]  And I tell you what... No, I know there is, but the way they know how to set us up and the way we're walking into these traps and just how nasty they are and the fact that they're not easy to beat really, really upsets me.
[02:04:29.452 --> 02:04:30.712]  But God bless you.
[02:04:30.712 --> 02:04:32.353]  Anything else you want to add, Mike?
[02:04:32.353 --> 02:04:33.813]  Yeah, you always say it.
[02:04:34.967 --> 02:04:36.749]  When you're in Christ, you're free.
[02:04:36.749 --> 02:04:38.631]  You got nothing to lose, right?
[02:04:38.631 --> 02:04:42.435]  When you're free, on my deathbed, I'll look my kids in the eye and say, I fought.
[02:04:42.435 --> 02:04:44.417]  I did not sit down.
[02:04:44.417 --> 02:04:45.418]  And I stood up.
[02:04:45.418 --> 02:04:46.960]  And you're gonna do the same thing.
[02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:49.723]  And I want the rest of the veterans to stand up and do the same thing.
[02:04:49.723 --> 02:04:51.625]  It's time to save the Republic.
[02:04:51.625 --> 02:04:52.546]  Call back again, Mike.
[02:04:52.546 --> 02:04:53.147]  Beautiful call.
[02:04:56.815 --> 02:04:58.837]  Robert Moritz, what has Big Tech become?
[02:04:58.837 --> 02:05:00.858]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[02:05:00.858 --> 02:05:07.364]  And the way they did so is because they face no consequence, social, economic, political, or legal, for their illicit activities over two decades.
[02:05:07.364 --> 02:05:18.233]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real social, political, economic consequence
[02:05:18.473 --> 02:05:18.693]  I think?
[02:05:38.234 --> 02:05:41.215]  To make real the original promise of an independent free press.
[02:05:41.215 --> 02:05:47.959]  Real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[02:05:47.959 --> 02:05:50.840]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[02:05:50.840 --> 02:05:52.641]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[02:05:52.641 --> 02:05:54.542]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[02:05:54.542 --> 02:05:55.803]  Even it is what you just saw.
[02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:06.001]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:06:06.001 --> 02:06:17.323]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:17.323 --> 02:06:19.523]  Okay.
[02:06:19.523 --> 02:06:28.005]  I'm gonna break this down as simply and succinctly as I can, and this is really a public service announcement, and it's what the facts show.
[02:06:29.735 --> 02:06:36.719]  There's a lot of facets to psychological warfare and to brainwashing people.
[02:06:36.719 --> 02:06:44.544]  And if you look at one area and liken it to that, it would be the Nigerian phone scam or the Nigerian email scam.
[02:06:44.544 --> 02:06:51.868]  And I have had three members of my extended family fall prey to the Nigerian scams.
[02:06:51.868 --> 02:06:54.310]  And when they fall prey to them and get robbed,
[02:06:56.462 --> 02:07:01.485]  They will never admit they were robbed or scammed to the person that warned them.
[02:07:01.485 --> 02:07:07.069]  That's how the Nigerians will first get one payment and then they'll trick you to give another payment.
[02:07:07.069 --> 02:07:13.273]  And you don't want to admit that you've already put in a bunch of payments, so you put in more and more.
[02:07:13.273 --> 02:07:14.534]  It's how gambling works.
[02:07:14.534 --> 02:07:16.595]  I'm not a gambler that just gambles for money.
[02:07:16.595 --> 02:07:18.677]  I gamble for freedom.
[02:07:18.677 --> 02:07:23.420]  But how it works with the dopamine is when you go in and you make an investment,
[02:07:24.448 --> 02:07:28.192]  And you put the money in the slot machine or you put the money on the crap table and you don't get it back.
[02:07:28.192 --> 02:07:29.514]  You think, well, I don't want to lose that.
[02:07:29.514 --> 02:07:32.337]  I better get back in again.
[02:07:32.337 --> 02:07:35.841]  Now 4chan and 8chan have a lot of great memes, a lot of great things.
[02:07:35.841 --> 02:07:42.029]  There's a lot of great people on there, but it's a lot of anonymous people who can go on there and put any disinfo they want.
[02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:48.462]  And the big no-no on 4Chan is ever questioning 4Chan or 8Chan, or that somebody could be set up on there.
[02:07:48.462 --> 02:07:49.982]  You just don't do that.
[02:07:49.982 --> 02:07:51.963]  Just Alex Jones bad.
[02:07:51.963 --> 02:07:57.144]  They know they can't get Orange Man, so Orange Man good, but so much of what Orange Man does is bad.
[02:07:57.144 --> 02:07:59.225]  You understand how that works?
[02:07:59.225 --> 02:08:02.826]  And again, I'm not saying everyone on 4Chan or 8Chan is bad.
[02:08:02.826 --> 02:08:09.108]  I'm saying bad people can go on there and they can run scams, like anybody could, but something set up to be anonymous
[02:08:10.933 --> 02:08:14.315]  Like the dark web of anything is going to have dangers.
[02:08:14.315 --> 02:08:21.999]  And so I watched this Q phenomenon start a few years ago, and I watched Corsi get in a big fight with him, after he'd been so enamored with it.
[02:08:21.999 --> 02:08:25.401]  And I just said, listen, I don't like anything that's secret.
[02:08:25.401 --> 02:08:26.842]  Okay?
[02:08:26.842 --> 02:08:31.245]  Because if it's a public movement, someone can do something in my name.
[02:08:31.245 --> 02:08:35.547]  I said they have a right to exist, to do whatever they want, as long as it's not violent.
[02:08:35.547 --> 02:08:38.049]  A lot of good people are going to believe in it, they're going to get involved in it.
[02:08:38.939 --> 02:08:40.160]  But it's just like anonymous.
[02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:43.184]  People always ask me, are you for anonymous?
[02:08:43.184 --> 02:08:48.690]  And I'd say, well, anonymous could be anybody wearing a Guy Fawkes mask doing a video show.
[02:08:48.690 --> 02:08:50.732]  Some stuff people do in that name I agree with.
[02:08:50.732 --> 02:08:51.733]  Some stuff's bad.
[02:08:51.733 --> 02:08:55.718]  You know, the globalists have been caught setting up things in the name of anonymous.
[02:08:57.799 --> 02:09:02.020]  So along comes the Q movement that I've now learned was the answer to InfoWars.
[02:09:02.020 --> 02:09:05.581]  We're a populist pro-America out in the open movement that isn't a cult.
[02:09:05.581 --> 02:09:06.842]  We don't have meetings.
[02:09:06.842 --> 02:09:11.103]  I just promote ideas and things and people listen and check them out.
[02:09:11.103 --> 02:09:14.224]  But see, if you have Q, it can put out the breadcrumbs.
[02:09:14.224 --> 02:09:15.485]  It can say what's going on.
[02:09:15.485 --> 02:09:22.727]  It can show you this, show you that, and then, oh, you have a relationship with the president and you've got all these people believing they have a relationship with the president.
[02:09:24.201 --> 02:09:31.183]  Including sheriff's deputies and all these people that show up with Mike Pence wearing Q things on their badges.
[02:09:31.183 --> 02:09:35.085]  And then Mike Pence sees it and takes the Twitter down.
[02:09:35.085 --> 02:09:45.568]  And then an obviously mentally ill person, he tries to do a citizen's arrest, goes and believes federal marshals are going to release him when he goes to citizen arrest the head of the Gambino crime family.
[02:09:45.568 --> 02:09:48.489]  They reportedly get in an argument or whatever happened and then that guy dies.
[02:09:48.489 --> 02:09:53.611]  And then I'm reading in the New York Times that Q, part of Alex Jones' movement, went and killed him.
[02:09:54.793 --> 02:09:56.654]  I had nothing to do with that.
[02:09:56.654 --> 02:09:59.215]  And so it's a perfect way to set people up.
[02:09:59.215 --> 02:10:08.340]  So this weekend, I was reviewing the Gambino thing that happened a few weeks ago, and I was reviewing Sarah Sanders, saying we're not for any group that calls for violence.
[02:10:08.340 --> 02:10:13.963]  And I was just thinking about, man, Antifa's getting ready to launch more terror attacks.
[02:10:13.963 --> 02:10:16.905]  How are they going to operate?
[02:10:19.198 --> 02:10:24.001]  How are they going to launch these attacks that have the media cover it up, but then act like it's part of a civil war?
[02:10:24.001 --> 02:10:29.685]  They're going to need some type of right-wing group that they can cut out and blame.
[02:10:29.685 --> 02:10:39.931]  But because libertarians and Christians and conservatives know not to be offensively violent, because we're law-abiding, and because we understand they're trying to set us up, we've never taken the bait, even when Antifa attacks us.
[02:10:39.931 --> 02:10:47.556]  But if you've got a Q movement, it's perfect to have globalist informants and foundation operatives and deep-staters that are in the FBI particularly.
[02:10:48.786 --> 02:10:59.353]  Go out, reach out, wind up people believing they're working with the President to attack a dam, or to go kill the Gambino crime boss, or to kill their brother with a sword, or whatever.
[02:10:59.353 --> 02:11:10.980]  And it just becomes this giant cauldron now, because they identify with it, they can then be set up, and then that can be the excuse to say, oh, it's not just Antifa, no, no, no, Q did this!
[02:11:12.571 --> 02:11:16.493]  The whole thing reeked from the beginning until, of course, I think it's a setup.
[02:11:16.493 --> 02:11:19.735]  Most of the stuff out of 4chan, you know, ends up being a joke or a prank or whatever.
[02:11:19.735 --> 02:11:21.476]  This is a perfect thing for an intelligence agency.
[02:11:21.476 --> 02:11:23.838]  You know, they're trying to shut me down and InfoWars down.
[02:11:23.838 --> 02:11:25.399]  They're not trying to shut down 4chan or 8chan.
[02:11:25.399 --> 02:11:28.300]  It's like, oh no, it's really good.
[02:11:28.300 --> 02:11:28.760]  It's really great.
[02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:29.541]  I'm like, okay, whatever.
[02:11:29.541 --> 02:11:32.823]  You're getting a lot of traffic off of it because Google doesn't censor QTalk.
[02:11:35.427 --> 02:11:36.307]  But it censors me.
[02:11:36.307 --> 02:11:38.748]  I said, that's a number one suspicion right there.
[02:11:38.748 --> 02:11:47.291]  You know, any schizophrenic saying I'm, you know, this or that, or Jones is about to go to prison, they're pushed, but I'm banned.
[02:11:47.291 --> 02:11:48.731]  Well, here it is.
[02:11:48.731 --> 02:11:52.372]  This is Yahoo, top of Yahoo, exclusive.
[02:11:52.372 --> 02:11:58.354]  FBI document warns conspiracy theories are new domestic terror threat.
[02:11:58.354 --> 02:12:01.735]  And it says, you know, the belief in the world government, belief in the new world order, all this.
[02:12:01.735 --> 02:12:04.336]  QAnon, a shadowy network that believes in deep state conspiracies.
[02:12:06.368 --> 02:12:09.273]  Well, the deep state is a shadowy network.
[02:12:09.273 --> 02:12:14.140]  And the theory of pedophilia, including Clinton associates, are being run out of the basement of Washington DC pizzeria.
[02:12:14.140 --> 02:12:15.983]  Know that she uses pedophilia to control people.
[02:12:17.725 --> 02:12:29.137]  And they go on and say, oh, conspiracy theory is now associated with terror, and oh, look, QAnon tried to, you know, attack the Hoover Dam, whether that's true or not, and man suspected of killing Gambino.
[02:12:29.137 --> 02:12:31.559]  My boss drew QAnon's symbol on his hand.
[02:12:31.559 --> 02:12:36.344]  This poor guy thought federal marshals were going to let him go and Trump was going to pardon him.
[02:12:38.834 --> 02:12:42.116]  And they've all got this crazy look, they're in contact with the President.
[02:12:42.116 --> 02:12:44.917]  Meanwhile, I've talked to the President many times on the phone.
[02:12:44.917 --> 02:12:48.800]  The President tweets out our stuff all the time, and our reporter stuff all the time.
[02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:56.124]  And I, I'm not going to get into it all, but the President's told me, keep up what you're doing, great job, keep up, press the attack.
[02:12:56.124 --> 02:13:01.567]  And then I talk to the national Fox host every week, I get intel from them, everything.
[02:13:01.567 --> 02:13:04.348]  I'm up here, I'm a real guy, 25 years on air.
[02:13:04.348 --> 02:13:06.970]  I have no credit, I'm not even just chopped liver.
[02:13:08.439 --> 02:13:10.020]  Well, the President tweets your stuff?
[02:13:10.020 --> 02:13:11.101]  That's not Q-level!
[02:13:11.101 --> 02:13:13.783]  In fact, the President's not even Q-level.
[02:13:13.783 --> 02:13:21.710]  There's an alien above him that's Q. It's all just a bunch of delusional crazies wanting to be part of something special.
[02:13:21.710 --> 02:13:26.173]  When you're already part of America, you're already part of getting Trump elected, you're already a patriot.
[02:13:26.173 --> 02:13:36.061]  And you're interfacing on the Internet just like you're a 10-year-old girl thinks she's talking to a 10-year-old boy and it's some 40-year-old pedophile trying to trick you to, you know, go meet him in a park somewhere.
[02:13:36.061 --> 02:13:36.822]  You end up dead.
[02:13:38.581 --> 02:13:43.984]  And I've had the conversations I have with my daughters about being on the internet, you know, don't ever talk to somebody you don't know, don't ever do this or that.
[02:13:43.984 --> 02:13:51.248]  And they listen to me, but the general public, once they've already been, well, I'm part of Q and I'm not bad.
[02:13:51.248 --> 02:14:07.057]  No, you're not part of Q, you're an American who's awake and already involved, who then hears Q say a bunch of things you agree with, who then wants to feel like you're part of something secret, like, this was an email from Prince Abala Kamunda of Nigeria.
[02:14:08.223 --> 02:14:13.546]  I have $15 million in the New York Bank, but I cannot get it out because of my cousin.
[02:14:13.546 --> 02:14:14.447]  He has caused me a problem.
[02:14:14.447 --> 02:14:18.049]  But if I get $1,000 from you, I heard you're a good person, from good people.
[02:14:18.049 --> 02:14:20.391]  You know, I am special.
[02:14:20.391 --> 02:14:21.211]  You will get $1,000,000 for the $1,000,000.
[02:14:21.211 --> 02:14:22.632]  You send the $1,000,000, and then it doesn't come back.
[02:14:22.632 --> 02:14:23.793]  And you're like, oh, it's all right.
[02:14:23.793 --> 02:14:23.993]  I need $10,000,000.
[02:14:23.993 --> 02:14:24.393]  You'll get $5,000,000 now.
[02:14:24.393 --> 02:14:25.174]  Oh, thank you, Prince Boo Boo.
[02:14:33.988 --> 02:14:35.770]  We are sorry we cannot send the money.
[02:14:35.770 --> 02:14:40.876]  We need $20,000, but I will fly myself to meet you after money.
[02:14:40.876 --> 02:14:42.478]  I'll get to meet the Royal Highness.
[02:14:42.478 --> 02:14:45.281]  You will meet him.
[02:14:45.281 --> 02:14:49.166]  And so this is how the scam works.
[02:14:49.166 --> 02:14:52.991]  You get so invested in the hallucination.
[02:14:55.874 --> 02:14:58.755]  That then you can't believe you've been conned.
[02:14:58.755 --> 02:15:00.935]  And see, they can't get the Patriots to do anything.
[02:15:00.935 --> 02:15:10.017]  So now it's Q, they can stage it and say it's Q, that they now says it's the Patriot movement, and that I supposedly run, The New York Times says.
[02:15:10.017 --> 02:15:23.280]  Or they can wind up crazies to think they're going to get a secret box of information at a parking garage, like Arlington Road, and you walk in to get the secret box of documents, because Trump ordered you there, and the car bomb goes off.
[02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:27.583]  With all your info left in a briefcase a mile away.
[02:15:27.583 --> 02:15:29.405]  So, don't go in that parking garage.
[02:15:29.405 --> 02:15:31.867]  Some of you are probably pissing right now.
[02:15:31.867 --> 02:15:33.248]  I'm already getting calls to go to a parking garage.
[02:15:33.248 --> 02:15:35.310]  Yeah, they're already testing you, dumbass.
[02:15:35.310 --> 02:15:37.452]  So, you want to go walk into a truck bomb?
[02:15:37.452 --> 02:15:41.796]  Or you want to get set up because you're talking to the President?
[02:15:41.796 --> 02:15:43.437]  I don't just talk to the President.
[02:15:43.437 --> 02:15:46.720]  My listeners got him elected!
[02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:48.421]  We're the dog trumps the tail!
[02:15:49.631 --> 02:15:51.876]  The American people are bigger than Trump!
[02:15:51.876 --> 02:15:54.081]  You stupid-ass Q-Cult members!

[02:16:06.175 --> 02:16:13.902]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[02:16:13.902 --> 02:16:21.769]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[02:16:21.929 --> 02:16:23.730]  Not a security IPO or note.
[02:16:23.730 --> 02:16:33.256]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.

[02:18:01.964 --> 02:18:05.127]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
[02:18:05.127 --> 02:18:08.269]  And we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen.
[02:18:08.269 --> 02:18:20.498]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[02:18:20.498 --> 02:18:25.562]  And so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart.
[02:18:25.562 --> 02:18:26.883]  And I want you to know that love is right back
[02:18:26.903 --> 02:18:28.584]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:18:56.308 --> 02:19:04.492]  Before I started working at InfoWars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and InfoWars.com, but also the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:19:04.492 --> 02:19:11.855]  And there's one product that's offered at InfoWarsStore.com that is the elite of the supplements, and that's DNA Force Plus.
[02:19:11.855 --> 02:19:15.377]  Now, I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests.
[02:19:15.797 --> 02:19:19.639]  Tellomeres and telomere support with your DNA.
[02:19:19.639 --> 02:19:28.064]  So I started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres.
[02:19:28.064 --> 02:19:31.485]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus, but it's expensive.
[02:19:31.485 --> 02:19:31.806]  Why?
[02:19:31.806 --> 02:19:34.587]  Because it is an elite supplement.
[02:19:34.587 --> 02:19:39.730]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support.
[02:19:40.290 --> 02:19:44.911]  And they came and they went, but DNA Force Plus is still there.
[02:19:44.911 --> 02:19:46.592]  It is the elite supplement.
[02:19:46.592 --> 02:19:50.253]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive.
[02:19:50.253 --> 02:19:59.715]  So you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at Infowarsstore.com.

[02:20:53.825 --> 02:20:56.489]  We're going to our guest, Joey Gibson, who's just been over in
[02:20:58.447 --> 02:21:08.772]  Hong Kong and Asia for a few weeks you've been part of the protests and you've got the you've got the Chinese military openly preparing to invade right now and there's a whole history there.
[02:21:08.772 --> 02:21:10.753]  This is major escalations that are taking place.
[02:21:10.753 --> 02:21:19.236]  The Chinese military, we'll have it for you next segment, has released a very threatening ominous video meaning to intimidate the people there.
[02:21:19.236 --> 02:21:20.297]  We'll have that as well.
[02:21:20.297 --> 02:21:25.619]  We'll also continue with your calls but I wanted to finish up with the FBI.
[02:21:25.619 --> 02:21:26.780]  Remember it was a big deal
[02:21:27.796 --> 02:21:38.959]  When we got the secret documents 10 years ago from the FBI, from the Federal Marshals, from the State Police.
[02:21:38.959 --> 02:21:42.139]  The Federal Marshals got it from the FBI.
[02:21:42.139 --> 02:21:43.340]  And people said it was fake.
[02:21:43.340 --> 02:21:44.320]  And they said, no, it's real.
[02:21:44.320 --> 02:21:49.201]  Alex Jones broke secret State Police report.
[02:21:49.201 --> 02:21:53.762]  Ron Paul, Bob Barr, Chuck Baldwin, libertarians, veterans, you name it, as terrorists.
[02:21:56.718 --> 02:22:00.059]  We got it from a Missouri State Police version.
[02:22:00.059 --> 02:22:03.761]  We got a California State Police version.
[02:22:03.761 --> 02:22:06.042]  Now, why is that important?
[02:22:06.042 --> 02:22:14.145]  Because Joey Gibson and his Patriot Pair group are public, and they're non-violent, and they stand up to Antifa, a real terror organization.
[02:22:14.145 --> 02:22:15.286]  Infowars is a real group.
[02:22:15.286 --> 02:22:20.648]  You know, we got the real document about how they were saying that mainline conservatives were terrorists.
[02:22:20.648 --> 02:22:21.869]  And Obama had to admit that was true.
[02:22:21.869 --> 02:22:22.709]  It was a national story.
[02:22:24.684 --> 02:22:32.832]  Well now, Yahoo today, exclusive, FBI document warns conspiracy theories are a new domestic terror threat because of QAnon.
[02:22:32.832 --> 02:22:48.806]  And the fact that people are going out and committing acts of violence in the name of QAnon, believing Trump told them to do so.
[02:22:48.806 --> 02:22:50.488]  Even though the outgoing press secretary
[02:22:53.962 --> 02:22:56.945]  Sarah Huckabee Sanders, when asked about it, said, we're not part of that.
[02:22:56.945 --> 02:23:06.152]  And if you go to the Wikipedia run by the Globalist, it's got a big picture of Broward County Police put Q on and then went and when the vice president got off a plane, so that's their proof.
[02:23:06.152 --> 02:23:10.436]  Look, Q's legitimate because they were next to Mike Pence.
[02:23:14.813 --> 02:23:16.815]  It's just amazing.
[02:23:16.815 --> 02:23:17.856]  You can see the setup now.
[02:23:17.856 --> 02:23:23.221]  When Antifa carries out their terror, they're going to have people in the name of Q do more of this.
[02:23:23.221 --> 02:23:34.252]  Some of them so mind-controlled by the internet that they literally believe Trump is ordering them to go do these things.
[02:23:34.252 --> 02:23:36.574]  And then they're thinking that Trump's coming to save them in the jail cell.
[02:23:37.927 --> 02:23:39.589]  When they shoot people.
[02:23:39.589 --> 02:23:41.072]  That's leftist mind control.
[02:23:41.072 --> 02:23:42.834]  That's them making fun of us.
[02:23:42.834 --> 02:23:45.238]  The perfect psychological warfare system.
[02:23:45.238 --> 02:23:46.419]  Here's Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
[02:23:48.749 --> 02:23:50.711]  Two quickies about last night in Tampa.
[02:23:50.711 --> 02:23:58.239]  First of all, does the President encourage the support of people who showed up last night in these QAnon and Blacks for Trump fringe groups?
[02:23:58.239 --> 02:24:11.732]  And secondly, is the White House willing to say right now, in view of what happened with one of our TV colleagues last night, that it is wrong for his most vocal supporters to be menacing toward journalists doing their jobs in a situation like that or in any situation?
[02:24:12.212 --> 02:24:26.460]  On the first part, the president condemns and denounces any group that would incite violence against another individual and certainly doesn't support groups that would promote that type of behavior.
[02:24:26.460 --> 02:24:31.682]  We've been clear about that a number of times since the beginning of the administration.
[02:24:31.682 --> 02:24:36.905]  On the second part of your question, the president, as I just said, does not support
[02:24:37.385 --> 02:24:38.045]  That's enough.
[02:24:38.045 --> 02:24:39.606]  I want to go to Joey Gibson.
[02:25:04.711 --> 02:25:09.734]  And then I'm going to host someone in the next hour, but we have another great host, Matt Bracken, taking over as well.
[02:25:09.734 --> 02:25:11.235]  I've got so much to hit.
[02:25:11.235 --> 02:25:19.940]  But I'm not just trying to pick a fight here with Q. Q is just some anonymous thing that could be the FBI, could be George Soros, could be a nice person, could be a bad person.
[02:25:19.940 --> 02:25:21.982]  I'm trying to be able to figure out how dangerous this is.
[02:25:22.822 --> 02:25:29.466]  And how I knew they need to somehow set up the right wing, and I've known it's going to be Q. And now these things are provocateuring.
[02:25:29.466 --> 02:25:34.250]  These are intelligence agents manipulating mentally ill and gullible people.
[02:25:34.250 --> 02:25:38.813]  I'm not saying everybody involved with Q is that, but I'm saying we can clearly see where it's going.
[02:25:38.813 --> 02:25:40.654]  And then meanwhile, Trump tweets our stuff.
[02:25:40.654 --> 02:25:41.895]  Trump comes on the show.
[02:25:41.895 --> 02:25:43.276]  I talk to Trump sometimes.
[02:25:43.276 --> 02:25:45.237]  I talk to his associates all the time.
[02:25:45.237 --> 02:25:46.498]  You know, we really are here.
[02:25:46.498 --> 02:25:47.519]  We're real, Joey.
[02:25:47.519 --> 02:25:48.299]  You're real.
[02:25:48.299 --> 02:25:52.062]  But then some nebulous thing, we've all got to bow down and follow orders from.
[02:25:52.062 --> 02:25:52.462]  What do you think?
[02:25:54.423 --> 02:25:58.185]  Yeah, I'm definitely real and I think that people got to show their faces and got to get up.
[02:25:58.185 --> 02:26:00.927]  You have to be a symbol for the people.
[02:26:00.927 --> 02:26:07.070]  And so I definitely think we should pay attention to people who are real and you can see their faces and see them talk.
[02:26:07.070 --> 02:26:09.631]  Yeah, notice what a Q and Andy have in common.
[02:26:09.631 --> 02:26:12.933]  You can't see their faces.
[02:26:12.933 --> 02:26:13.774]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:26:13.774 --> 02:26:14.614]  And it is concerning.
[02:26:14.614 --> 02:26:17.676]  I mean, Q said some things that are very appealing.
[02:26:18.457 --> 02:26:20.319]  But I don't know too much about them.
[02:26:20.319 --> 02:26:25.603]  I definitely think that people always have to be careful and you can't just trust, you know, something that's not even real.
[02:26:25.603 --> 02:26:41.955]  I'm just simply saying it's the perfect cutout now to say that, oh look, there are right-wing terrorists, oh Antifa's good, oh the white people are all committing terror attacks, all that's made up, and then you start seeing these murders and things with mentally ill people wound up by these folks posing as this supposed cute thing.
[02:26:41.955 --> 02:26:44.197]  I mean, I can see this as the next stage.
[02:26:44.197 --> 02:26:45.738]  But I got you on late, I appreciate you coming on.
[02:26:45.738 --> 02:26:46.859]  You just got back from Asia.
[02:26:47.619 --> 02:26:50.840]  I know you've got ties back there.
[02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:52.421]  Chinese government threatening to invade.
[02:26:52.421 --> 02:26:54.602]  This is a huge deal.
[02:26:54.602 --> 02:26:55.602]  You were part of the protest.
[02:26:55.602 --> 02:26:58.183]  What have you witnessed?
[02:26:58.183 --> 02:27:06.006]  So basically what I saw is in Hong Kong, they had seven and a half million people total, and they had two million people marching in the streets for freedom.
[02:27:06.006 --> 02:27:06.726]  It was unbelievable.
[02:27:06.726 --> 02:27:09.227]  And it doesn't matter if you're on the left, you're on the right.
[02:27:09.227 --> 02:27:13.389]  Everybody was fighting for freedom, you know, because they don't want China to take over.
[02:27:13.389 --> 02:27:16.210]  They know what's in store for the future if they allow China to take over.
[02:27:16.630 --> 02:27:24.518]  You have LGBT activists marching with Christian activists together because they don't care about the difference of political ideology, they only care about freedom.
[02:27:24.518 --> 02:27:27.882]  And for me, that's like my dream in America, right?
[02:27:27.882 --> 02:27:32.787]  For people to wake up, just like you Alex, to wake up so that we can fight together, right?
[02:27:32.787 --> 02:27:34.148]  Against the people at the top.
[02:27:34.148 --> 02:27:35.730]  In Hong Kong, that's what I saw.
[02:27:35.730 --> 02:27:37.171]  And they all support one another.
[02:27:39.457 --> 02:27:51.321]  One of the first protests I was at, once the police started to crack down, everyone ran down into the subway station, and workers in the subway station were literally helping people get through, and they were closing the gates so police can't come and get them.
[02:27:51.321 --> 02:27:57.624]  And they just stuffed the train with thousands of people, I was stuck in there too, shoulder to shoulder and just got them out there.
[02:27:58.504 --> 02:28:03.990]  Joey, I've got to start over because I segwayed into you with Antifa stuff and I apologize.
[02:28:03.990 --> 02:28:12.479]  I hadn't seen the sensational HD footage you sent us that we're playing right now for TV viewers and this solidarity you're going to have before we come back.
[02:28:12.479 --> 02:28:12.959]  Start over.
[02:28:13.883 --> 02:28:15.703]  Start over when we come back with this footage.
[02:28:15.703 --> 02:28:18.304]  We also have the Chinese military putting out their footage.
[02:28:18.304 --> 02:28:20.065]  It's very threatening and menacing.
[02:28:20.065 --> 02:28:28.587]  We're going to have that, and you'll be able to break down what the history of Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Chinese ramming people's ships today, threatening to attack U.S.
[02:28:28.587 --> 02:28:28.907]  ships.
[02:28:28.907 --> 02:28:30.867]  I mean, this is the big powder keg.
[02:28:30.867 --> 02:28:32.408]  This could turn into war very, very quickly.
[02:28:32.408 --> 02:28:33.548]  We hope it doesn't.
[02:28:33.548 --> 02:28:37.149]  Joey Gibson, a great patriot that goes out and faces down the Antifa.
[02:28:37.149 --> 02:28:40.650]  And you can visit his site, gibsonforfreedom.com.
[02:28:40.650 --> 02:28:41.110]  We have the big

[02:29:57.259 --> 02:30:13.802]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks in to people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements, in that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are, and how they were the best, and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[02:30:13.922 --> 02:30:18.005]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll shut us down.
[02:30:18.005 --> 02:30:21.688]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they work.
[02:30:21.688 --> 02:30:23.450]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[02:30:23.450 --> 02:30:27.693]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[02:30:27.693 --> 02:30:35.600]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[02:30:35.640 --> 02:30:38.341]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[02:30:38.341 --> 02:30:43.243]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[02:30:43.243 --> 02:30:44.424]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[02:30:44.424 --> 02:30:46.325]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature.
[02:30:46.325 --> 02:30:50.006]  But Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.

[02:33:42.709 --> 02:33:44.010]  $700,000 or something right now.
[02:33:44.010 --> 02:33:47.211]  That's only maybe $200,000 to fund things.
[02:33:47.211 --> 02:33:48.312]  I'm not complaining.
[02:33:48.312 --> 02:33:49.452]  I just want to expand.

[02:34:32.788 --> 02:34:34.148]  That is discounted right now.
[02:34:34.148 --> 02:34:40.330]  And just know that your purchases and your action, taking action to go get the products, makes all of this possible.
[02:34:40.330 --> 02:34:46.191]  Now, Joey Gibson, I got you on late.
[02:34:46.191 --> 02:34:47.471]  Joey Gibson, I got you on late.
[02:34:47.471 --> 02:34:50.332]  I really appreciate you coming on with us.
[02:34:50.332 --> 02:34:51.512]  And so you're the expert on this.
[02:34:51.512 --> 02:34:56.653]  You're not just the patriot prayer group that goes out and exposes Antifa with great courage.
[02:34:56.653 --> 02:34:59.413]  You've also gone and done journalism around the world.
[02:34:59.413 --> 02:35:00.894]  And you were over in Hong Kong.
[02:35:00.894 --> 02:35:01.594]  You've been in Asia.
[02:35:02.134 --> 02:35:16.883]  I know part of your lineage is Japanese, and so the best way for radio listeners and TV viewers, describe what's happening, how big it is, the Chinese already sending in their paramilitary in plain clothes, threatening to invade, massing troops right now as we speak, huge international crisis.
[02:35:16.883 --> 02:35:21.146]  You just got back, what, a day or so ago, and you shot amazing HD footage.
[02:35:21.146 --> 02:35:23.228]  We're going to be rolling in the background while you talk.
[02:35:23.228 --> 02:35:23.788]  Please take over.
[02:35:25.359 --> 02:35:35.448]  Yeah, so basically here's the thing, and I want people to understand this, is that Hong Kong has found a way to come together to fight against the Chinese Communist regime.
[02:35:35.448 --> 02:35:39.031]  I think that they saw the American flag and they went crazy over it.
[02:35:39.031 --> 02:35:42.253]  There's people crying and hugging us, taking pictures with the flag.
[02:35:42.253 --> 02:35:44.775]  They appreciate the American flag more than we do.
[02:35:44.775 --> 02:35:46.317]  Like, it was unbelievable.
[02:35:46.317 --> 02:35:50.560]  For me, the American flag, for the rest of the world, is a symbol of freedom.
[02:35:50.560 --> 02:35:52.542]  It's not just a symbol for America, right?
[02:35:52.962 --> 02:35:57.048]  And so when they saw this, their response was unbelievable to me.
[02:35:57.048 --> 02:36:03.797]  And the cool thing is that after that, every single week since we left, they've been flying American flags themselves.
[02:36:03.797 --> 02:36:04.438]  So it's really cool.
[02:36:04.438 --> 02:36:06.020]  And they're asking Trump for help.
[02:36:06.020 --> 02:36:09.225]  But I think that Americans should be very involved in what's going on in Hong Kong because
[02:36:10.706 --> 02:36:17.309]  Alex, you understand, but the Americans don't understand how much of a threat China is to this country and to this world.
[02:36:17.309 --> 02:36:20.071]  They're the biggest threat to America, in my opinion.
[02:36:20.071 --> 02:36:21.972]  They've already infiltrated this country.
[02:36:21.972 --> 02:36:28.215]  When I was over there, I would see the media, the Chinese media, was doing the exact same thing that our media here does.
[02:36:28.215 --> 02:36:34.178]  They're actually posting doctored photos of a protester as if she had a see-through shirt on, as if she was being arrested.
[02:36:34.178 --> 02:36:36.359]  So they pull all these nasty tricks.
[02:36:36.359 --> 02:36:38.921]  They dox all the protesters, the leaders.
[02:36:40.164 --> 02:36:41.046]  It's unbelievable.
[02:36:41.046 --> 02:36:46.743]  Six years ago, several leaders got arrested in the original Umbrella movement.
[02:36:47.409 --> 02:36:51.310]  They come out, then the very next day they're on the streets fighting for freedom with the people.
[02:36:51.310 --> 02:36:52.810]  This is how passionate they are.
[02:36:52.810 --> 02:36:55.871]  They will do anything, right, to fight for freedom.
[02:36:55.871 --> 02:36:57.412]  And Joey, let's explain what's happening.
[02:36:57.412 --> 02:37:09.615]  China is taking over Hong Kong and trying to take over Taiwan, even though they've been semi and totally autonomous in the case of Taiwan, and now they're threatening to invade because they're passing a law to secretly arrest and disappear people.
[02:37:11.223 --> 02:37:12.584]  Yeah, extradition bill.
[02:37:12.584 --> 02:37:16.727]  Basically what that will allow is the Chinese government just has to say that you committed a crime in China.
[02:37:16.727 --> 02:37:17.767]  They can just lie.
[02:37:17.767 --> 02:37:19.008]  Take you out of Hong Kong.
[02:37:19.008 --> 02:37:23.751]  And what's going to happen is if that bill passes, they're just going to start destroying free speech.
[02:37:23.751 --> 02:37:24.992]  Just like they do in China.
[02:37:24.992 --> 02:37:25.252]  Right?
[02:37:25.252 --> 02:37:31.276]  They just start extraditing all the leaders of the movement, put fear in the people's hearts, and that'll be the end of free speech.
[02:37:32.341 --> 02:37:33.943]  Aren't they playing with fire, though?
[02:37:33.943 --> 02:37:37.027]  Because China's already on the edge of toppling.
[02:37:37.027 --> 02:37:41.773]  Taiwan and Hong Kong could trigger a resistance that ends up reverberating into China.
[02:37:41.773 --> 02:37:43.956]  I don't think this will go the way Tiananmen Square went.
[02:37:43.956 --> 02:37:45.598]  I don't think there's going to be a stand-down.
[02:37:45.598 --> 02:37:51.165]  Well, what was the sense if they sent in a bunch of Chinese military with the Hong Kong collaborator government?
[02:37:53.512 --> 02:37:54.934]  The people won't stop.
[02:37:54.934 --> 02:37:56.695]  Like these people are willing to die for this.
[02:37:56.695 --> 02:37:58.997]  And so I think it'd be a bad move by China.
[02:37:58.997 --> 02:38:10.886]  One of the things that I hear a lot from the protesters, they believe that if they can secure their freedom through protesting, it's going to send a shockwave throughout all these countries like Taiwan, even Tibet.
[02:38:10.886 --> 02:38:15.770]  You know, Tibet, they're still protesting, even though they'll arrest thousands of people and they just disappear.
[02:38:16.317 --> 02:38:20.300]  So something's happening, the people are pushing back, and I think Hong Kong is the key.
[02:38:20.300 --> 02:38:22.202]  People really need to be involved.
[02:38:22.202 --> 02:38:32.410]  And for me, the thing that was so inspiring is that these people are fighting for their freedom while we sit, while us in America just sit around, right?
[02:38:32.410 --> 02:38:33.651]  And we don't do anything.
[02:38:33.651 --> 02:38:36.073]  We just allow this government to get bigger and bigger.
[02:38:36.073 --> 02:38:37.914]  You want to know the future of our country?
[02:38:37.914 --> 02:38:42.858]  Look at China, if we don't do something soon.
[02:38:42.858 --> 02:38:45.160]  Joey Gibson, what got you over there during this time?
[02:38:47.421 --> 02:38:54.007]  Basically, seeing millions of people march against the communist regime in China, I was like, I have to go.
[02:38:54.007 --> 02:38:56.209]  There's no way I could not be part of this.
[02:38:56.209 --> 02:39:01.093]  And I had to witness it, I had to get video, I had to interview people, I just had to experience it.
[02:39:01.093 --> 02:39:04.116]  And it was a life-changing event for me.
[02:39:04.116 --> 02:39:05.878]  It opened me up a lot and it made me
[02:39:06.593 --> 02:39:11.076]  It was encouraging because what I always dreamed of in America, right?
[02:39:11.076 --> 02:39:12.857]  Sometimes it just seems impossible.
[02:39:12.857 --> 02:39:16.379]  But then to see it in real life in Hong Kong, it was unbelievable.
[02:39:16.379 --> 02:39:17.439]  It's like, it is possible!
[02:39:17.439 --> 02:39:19.461]  You just have to wake people up.
[02:39:19.461 --> 02:39:22.162]  People have to understand what's in store for our future.
[02:39:22.162 --> 02:39:26.485]  Because in Hong Kong, the advantage they have is they know what's in store for their future.
[02:39:26.485 --> 02:39:29.547]  They can look at China and they can see what's going to happen to them.
[02:39:29.547 --> 02:39:30.727]  Their free speech will be destroyed.
[02:39:30.727 --> 02:39:31.848]  Freedom of religion will be destroyed.
[02:39:32.208 --> 02:39:33.089]  Right?
[02:39:33.089 --> 02:39:34.591]  Censoring the internet.
[02:39:34.591 --> 02:39:38.274]  But for us in America, a lot of us aren't awake yet.
[02:39:38.274 --> 02:39:39.996]  We don't understand what's in store for our future.
[02:39:39.996 --> 02:39:44.280]  We don't understand the tyranny that's taken over this country.
[02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:49.445]  And so many of their grandparents either got killed or barely escaped.
[02:39:49.445 --> 02:39:53.529]  Or their parents, they know that China's killed five times what Hitler killed.
[02:39:55.731 --> 02:39:56.491]  Yeah.
[02:39:56.491 --> 02:40:00.013]  China literally has slaves in their country right now.
[02:40:00.013 --> 02:40:00.573]  Right now.
[02:40:00.573 --> 02:40:05.235]  They have the suicide nets in the warehouses so people can't kill themselves because they're so miserable.
[02:40:05.235 --> 02:40:07.596]  People gotta wake up at how bad China really is.
[02:40:07.596 --> 02:40:11.177]  I mean, China is just destroying our country right now.
[02:40:11.177 --> 02:40:14.118]  It's from the inside out, you know, buying everything up.
[02:40:14.118 --> 02:40:18.720]  You saw what happened with that movie where they took down the Taiwan flag.
[02:40:18.720 --> 02:40:20.141]  China is all Hollywood now.
[02:40:20.618 --> 02:40:21.719]  Yeah, top gun.
[02:40:21.719 --> 02:40:22.920]  It's very concerning.
[02:40:22.920 --> 02:40:23.921]  It's very concerning to me.
[02:40:23.921 --> 02:40:29.587]  And I know that Facebook and Google and all these other social media outlets are working with China.
[02:40:29.587 --> 02:40:36.615]  It's the same game plan that they're putting in America, just slower that that's happening in China right now.
[02:40:36.615 --> 02:40:39.417]  And big techs backing them.
[02:40:39.417 --> 02:40:40.899]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:40:40.899 --> 02:40:42.561]  And why does no one say anything about that?
[02:40:43.285 --> 02:40:49.475]  They're literally helping China find people, arrest them, and execute them.
[02:40:49.475 --> 02:40:52.881]  That's what Facebook is about in China right now.
[02:40:52.881 --> 02:40:55.867]  And so I think people need to understand, if you're a liberal,
[02:40:56.437 --> 02:41:00.758]  And you're, like, obsessed with the racist history or whatever in America?
[02:41:00.758 --> 02:41:01.239]  Okay, great.
[02:41:01.239 --> 02:41:05.380]  But what about the slavery that's happening right now in China?
[02:41:05.380 --> 02:41:10.081]  What about the people that are being executed because they're Christians in China right now?
[02:41:10.081 --> 02:41:15.303]  Oh, what about the millions of Muslims that have been executed or put in concentration camps?
[02:41:15.303 --> 02:41:17.524]  Does anyone on the left complain about that?
[02:41:17.524 --> 02:41:22.265]  I haven't heard anything.
[02:41:22.265 --> 02:41:23.906]  What's happened to the left?
[02:41:23.906 --> 02:41:24.786]  Were they always this bad?
[02:41:27.130 --> 02:41:28.932]  I don't know what's happening.
[02:41:28.932 --> 02:41:30.073]  They used to be a lot more moderate.
[02:41:30.073 --> 02:41:32.656]  They used to be more like Tulsi Gabbard.
[02:41:32.656 --> 02:41:34.417]  I gotta give a huge shout out to her, by the way.
[02:41:34.417 --> 02:41:37.040]  She's the only real Democrat that I see running right now.
[02:41:37.040 --> 02:41:45.008]  Like an actual, like original progressive that speaks from her heart and isn't being controlled by some weird person up above.
[02:41:45.008 --> 02:41:50.293]  But yeah, I think the left right now is probably starting for like real politicians.
[02:41:51.194 --> 02:41:53.496]  Who are real people like Trump?
[02:41:53.496 --> 02:41:56.199]  But I don't know it's gone so far to the left.
[02:41:56.199 --> 02:41:57.180]  It's all about rhetoric.
[02:41:57.180 --> 02:42:16.817]  It's emotional And it's it's really frustrating I mean and the lies are unbelievable right now the deception happening in this country just like in China is it's biblical Everything's upside down right now I'll tell you this footage you shot is amazing and this is just ongoing all because they don't want China to absorb them and
[02:42:18.721 --> 02:42:24.369]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:42:24.369 --> 02:42:29.336]  I think that this is what's amazing is that Hong Kong's been free for a long time now.
[02:42:31.201 --> 02:42:32.722]  For almost 100 years.
[02:42:32.722 --> 02:42:34.924]  And so they have a culture of freedom.
[02:42:34.924 --> 02:42:35.945]  They're family members.
[02:42:35.945 --> 02:42:37.166]  They think about their children.
[02:42:37.166 --> 02:42:39.088]  They think about the future of their children.
[02:42:39.088 --> 02:42:43.712]  And they cannot accept handing over their freedom to this communist regime.
[02:42:43.712 --> 02:42:44.813]  They will not accept it.
[02:42:44.813 --> 02:42:45.214]  That's right.
[02:42:45.214 --> 02:42:50.138]  We need Hong Kong and Taiwan to invade China politically.
[02:42:50.138 --> 02:42:53.921]  We need to free China, not have China expand into a giant cancer.
[02:42:53.921 --> 02:42:54.342]  Stay with us.
[02:42:55.148 --> 02:43:03.338]  Before I started working at InfoWars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and InfoWars.com, but also the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:43:03.338 --> 02:43:10.085]  And there's one product that's offered at InfoWarsStore.com that is the elite of the supplements, and that's DNA Force+.
[02:43:10.686 --> 02:43:14.629]  Now I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests.
[02:43:14.629 --> 02:43:18.473]  Telomeres and telomere support with your DNA.
[02:43:18.473 --> 02:43:26.900]  So I started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres.
[02:43:26.900 --> 02:43:29.042]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus but
[02:43:29.542 --> 02:43:30.302]  It's expensive.
[02:43:30.302 --> 02:43:30.622]  Why?
[02:43:30.622 --> 02:43:33.403]  Because it is an elite supplement.
[02:43:33.403 --> 02:43:40.686]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support, and they came and they went.
[02:43:40.686 --> 02:43:43.747]  But DNA Force Plus is still there.
[02:43:43.747 --> 02:43:45.428]  It is the elite supplement.
[02:43:45.428 --> 02:43:49.089]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive.
[02:43:49.089 --> 02:43:54.931]  So you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:43:55.171 --> 02:43:59.354]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[02:43:59.354 --> 02:44:00.414]  They are technocrats.
[02:44:00.414 --> 02:44:02.696]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[02:44:02.696 --> 02:44:10.060]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[02:44:10.060 --> 02:44:11.942]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[02:44:11.942 --> 02:44:14.023]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[02:44:14.403 --> 02:44:20.890]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[02:44:20.890 --> 02:44:26.076]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4WheelsLife.com, I couldn't do it.
[02:44:26.076 --> 02:44:35.106]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality, and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[02:44:36.067 --> 02:44:42.053]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[02:44:42.053 --> 02:44:42.994]  It is amazing.
[02:44:42.994 --> 02:44:52.983]  Experience pure Methocobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American Revolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:44:56.462 --> 02:45:02.404]  George Orwell said that in a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[02:45:02.404 --> 02:45:05.384]  And so, used to it wasn't that important to wear the American flag.
[02:45:05.384 --> 02:45:09.585]  Because we still loved our country and there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it.
[02:45:09.585 --> 02:45:12.566]  But now, they're trying to take it out of schools.
[02:45:12.566 --> 02:45:14.787]  They're taking it down off of government buildings.
[02:45:14.787 --> 02:45:19.628]  Weird white leftists that want a virtue signal are pulling down American flags and running up Mexican flags.
[02:45:20.268 --> 02:45:23.189]  This is the bizarreness of the America hating we're seeing.
[02:45:23.189 --> 02:45:39.294]  So now it is a revolutionary act in a time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying to wear the American flag, particularly the Betsy Ross anti-slavery flag, and particularly when it says on the back, right there ladies and gentlemen, America's back infulwars.com.
[02:45:39.294 --> 02:45:49.877]  So whatever you do, take action today and exercise your free speech in these bullies' face all over, not just the U.S., but worldwide, because more than ever, the American flag is a symbol of freedom against globalism.
[02:45:56.761 --> 02:45:56.981]  Oh, thanks.
[02:46:26.661 --> 02:46:29.283]  Well, sir, let me break this down for you.
[02:46:29.283 --> 02:46:30.764]  I want high quality stuff in there.
[02:46:30.764 --> 02:46:31.805]  I want a good price.
[02:46:31.805 --> 02:46:35.907]  But I've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[02:46:35.907 --> 02:46:37.729]  I'm making $2 on my toothpaste 50% off.
[02:46:37.729 --> 02:46:41.771]  And so it's the same thing with like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth.
[02:46:41.771 --> 02:46:42.712]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[02:46:42.712 --> 02:46:46.915]  But listen, when people get the Patriot points, a lot of times it makes things a loss later.
[02:46:46.915 --> 02:46:54.700]  Because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto ship, and then we're doing 50% off, and then you do something like that, where you have Patriot points, we lose money.
[02:46:54.700 --> 02:46:55.260]  But that's okay.
[02:46:55.260 --> 02:46:55.881]  Thanks for the support.
[02:46:59.292 --> 02:47:26.367]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:26.367 --> 02:47:26.687]  China?
[02:47:26.687 --> 02:47:28.728]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:30.549 --> 02:47:37.434]  ...has killed way more than the Russians under communism or the Nazis and the Germans under Hitler did.
[02:47:37.434 --> 02:47:45.219]  We just, oh, they're not white people running it, so it's good, it's liberal.
[02:47:45.219 --> 02:47:58.388]  It's a giant slave camp that globalist industries have used and built up and now it's ready to expand and take over Taiwan, to take over Hong Kong, the South China Sea, building all these military bases, dredging out.
[02:48:00.478 --> 02:48:04.481]  The ocean and building islands and putting weapons on it.
[02:48:04.481 --> 02:48:05.982]  China is expansionist.
[02:48:05.982 --> 02:48:08.785]  Because it's been given unlimited money.
[02:48:08.785 --> 02:48:11.527]  It's been given unlimited funding.
[02:48:11.527 --> 02:48:16.991]  It's been given 10% year after year growth rates by the traders in our government.
[02:48:16.991 --> 02:48:18.472]  And Trump is stopping that.
[02:48:18.472 --> 02:48:22.155]  He's just saying, hey, you're not going to make 100% on us, you're going to make 80%.
[02:48:22.155 --> 02:48:24.517]  He's just taking a little back.
[02:48:25.819 --> 02:48:28.721]  Everybody's flipping out because China bought up our debt.
[02:48:28.721 --> 02:48:29.722]  They bought up Hollywood.
[02:48:29.722 --> 02:48:32.905]  This was all done strategically by the globalists against the country.
[02:48:32.905 --> 02:48:38.970]  And Joey Gibson was just over in Hong Kong and just got back and is showing this amazing footage.
[02:48:38.970 --> 02:48:45.055]  And while you're talking, we're going to roll China warns Hong Kong protesters with slick military video.
[02:48:46.062 --> 02:48:48.685]  You're basically letting them know we can crush you.
[02:48:48.685 --> 02:48:58.975]  What are you, gut level, talking to folks when you were there just a few days ago, what are you thinking about the massing troops about to come in reportedly, or the plainclothes paramilitary they say came across just a few days ago?
[02:49:00.956 --> 02:49:04.639]  Yeah, I definitely think they're just trying to put fear into the protesters hearts.
[02:49:04.639 --> 02:49:06.341]  They need to stop the protests.
[02:49:06.341 --> 02:49:07.121]  China does.
[02:49:07.121 --> 02:49:09.484]  It is a threat to their security.
[02:49:09.484 --> 02:49:11.806]  Okay, so it's a really big deal what's going on there.
[02:49:11.806 --> 02:49:18.051]  Now, one of the things that they did in 2012, the police were really rough on the original Umbrella Movement.
[02:49:18.051 --> 02:49:19.212]  Like, really rough.
[02:49:19.212 --> 02:49:20.273]  And they arrested a bunch of them.
[02:49:20.894 --> 02:49:22.354]  And the protests just stopped.
[02:49:22.354 --> 02:49:25.075]  And then several years later, you know, it erupted again.
[02:49:25.075 --> 02:49:30.876]  But this time, when the police were too rough, there was such an outcry that more protesters would come out.
[02:49:30.876 --> 02:49:34.897]  Like I said, at one point, there was almost 2 million protesters on the streets.
[02:49:34.897 --> 02:49:39.578]  Now, what China did, and this is very frustrating because it's just like Antifa, right?
[02:49:39.578 --> 02:49:41.779]  They sent in a bunch of thugs wearing white shirts.
[02:49:42.617 --> 02:49:45.480]  Some of them look like police officers, in my opinion, watching them.
[02:49:45.480 --> 02:49:50.305]  And they just started beating up a bunch of random citizens down on the train station.
[02:49:50.305 --> 02:49:52.047]  The video was very hard to watch.
[02:49:52.688 --> 02:49:56.569]  These women were screaming for help and no police came to their aid.
[02:49:56.569 --> 02:50:04.872]  We're talking about, I think it was like 30 or 45 minutes, these thugs were allowed to run free in the train station and just beat up random people.
[02:50:04.872 --> 02:50:07.453]  Especially anyone that's wearing a black shirt, because that's what the protesters wear.
[02:50:07.453 --> 02:50:11.114]  But don't they know, like when the Chinese tried to take over Vietnam, that didn't work, or anywhere else?
[02:50:11.114 --> 02:50:19.597]  I mean, I think, knowing the history of the area, I think this is going to, don't these troops know they're going to end up being in bars and clubs when a woman walks up and stabs them in the throat?
[02:50:21.448 --> 02:50:23.470]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:50:23.470 --> 02:50:33.920]  One of the things, too, that concerns me about them sending in these people who are wearing plain clothes, like I said, one of the best things that Hong Kong has going for it is that all the people are united.
[02:50:33.920 --> 02:50:42.528]  And so if they start to start these fights with other citizens, per se, it's going to cause division, paranoia.
[02:50:42.528 --> 02:50:45.010]  And I think that it could be detrimental to the community.
[02:50:45.620 --> 02:50:47.402]  Because that's basically what happened in America.
[02:50:47.402 --> 02:50:55.249]  They basically just split us all apart, so we fight with one another, not just physically, but obviously, you know, politically.
[02:50:55.249 --> 02:51:00.393]  And so, we fight with each other instead of fighting against our government and the establishment figures.
[02:51:00.393 --> 02:51:12.564]  And so that was- And what you're saying is you see real unity, like we see unity in Japan, there's less crime there than anywhere in the world, but less crime even more so, like almost zero, they say, during an earthquake, versus here, there was an earthquake, there'd be looting everywhere.
[02:51:13.968 --> 02:51:14.828]  Absolutely.
[02:51:14.828 --> 02:51:24.031]  One of the things that I noticed is, of course, the only two white guys on the whole island find me with an American flag, and he just starts going off on me.
[02:51:24.031 --> 02:51:32.114]  Yelling at me, calling me a fascist, calling Trump a fascist, saying there's concentration camps, all the far-left talking points from America, right?
[02:51:32.114 --> 02:51:33.454]  And these guys would not leave me alone.
[02:51:33.454 --> 02:51:35.895]  One guy looked like a meth head, like, it was unbelievable.
[02:51:36.375 --> 02:51:44.238]  But the thing that I notice is that, you know the way that I am, I kind of talk back and stuff and I get kind of mad, I get into it and stuff.
[02:51:44.238 --> 02:51:46.339]  So many people kept, they were following me around for so many years.
[02:51:46.339 --> 02:51:47.699]  Well, you're not a little guy either.
[02:51:47.699 --> 02:51:50.340]  No, no.
[02:51:50.340 --> 02:51:52.401]  I'm a fighter, I just don't fight.
[02:51:52.401 --> 02:51:54.642]  Because I made a commitment to God that I'll be non-violent.
[02:51:55.751 --> 02:52:04.084]  These guys kept following me around and I'll stick up for myself, but so many people kept coming up to me and being like, Joey, just, just stop talking to them.
[02:52:04.084 --> 02:52:05.706]  They're like, don't even worry about them.
[02:52:05.706 --> 02:52:06.608]  We want you here.
[02:52:06.608 --> 02:52:08.250]  We want your American flag here.
[02:52:08.250 --> 02:52:09.512]  Just do what you want to do.
[02:52:09.512 --> 02:52:10.133]  Ignore them.
[02:52:10.828 --> 02:52:17.613]  And so, I understand that in Hong Kong and a lot of Asian countries, Asian cultures, a big part of it is collective.
[02:52:17.613 --> 02:52:19.235]  It's working together.
[02:52:19.235 --> 02:52:20.656]  It's not fighting.
[02:52:20.656 --> 02:52:22.117]  Like you said, they don't loot.
[02:52:22.117 --> 02:52:23.338]  They help each other out.
[02:52:23.338 --> 02:52:24.398]  And that's a big part of the culture.
[02:52:24.398 --> 02:52:26.220]  They don't like seeing the fighting.
[02:52:26.220 --> 02:52:29.522]  And in America, we like to see the fighting.
[02:52:29.522 --> 02:52:32.164]  We like to see the going back and forth.
[02:52:32.164 --> 02:52:33.926]  But it seems like they're ready to fight now though.
[02:52:36.317 --> 02:52:38.078]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:52:38.078 --> 02:52:41.219]  They're way more peaceful than Americans would be, but I saw some footage.
[02:52:41.219 --> 02:52:43.180]  They're starting to fight back.
[02:52:43.180 --> 02:52:47.301]  They're very upset about the Triad gang coming in and beating them up.
[02:52:47.301 --> 02:52:48.262]  It was amazing to me.
[02:52:48.262 --> 02:52:55.825]  I noticed they used the same little extension foils that can kill somebody if you hit them on the arteries to just sit there and whack, whack.
[02:52:55.825 --> 02:53:00.406]  It's like a car antenna just beating random people at a train station.
[02:53:00.406 --> 02:53:00.847]  Yeah.
[02:53:00.847 --> 02:53:04.208]  There's some pictures of people with their shirts off after and it's really bad.
[02:53:05.237 --> 02:53:09.280]  Um, but the interesting thing though, this is how strong they are in Hong Kong.
[02:53:09.280 --> 02:53:14.923]  You know, these people are just getting beat up left and right, yelling and screaming, asking, you know, for mercy.
[02:53:14.923 --> 02:53:22.388]  And then, uh, the next week they went, they had a huge march right into the neighborhoods where they felt like the tribes were from.
[02:53:22.388 --> 02:53:23.109]  So they're not going to run.
[02:53:23.109 --> 02:53:25.270]  I was about to say, they're taking over government buildings.
[02:53:25.270 --> 02:53:29.533]  They're not, they're not out there injecting heroin like leftist are at protests.
[02:53:29.533 --> 02:53:32.395]  They're, they're fighting hard.
[02:53:32.395 --> 02:53:32.875]  Yes, they are.
[02:53:33.610 --> 02:53:37.013]  And I'm convinced that they will fight to the very end.
[02:53:37.013 --> 02:53:42.056]  You know, it's sad to say, but people are going to die before they give up their freedom.
[02:53:42.056 --> 02:53:43.177]  I mean, that's just the way it is.
[02:53:43.177 --> 02:53:46.779]  And the thing that a lot of them talk about, they talk about their kids, right?
[02:53:46.779 --> 02:53:49.701]  They say they don't, they want freedom for their kids.
[02:53:49.701 --> 02:53:55.105]  And when you are thinking about your kids and future generations, you will do anything, right?
[02:53:55.105 --> 02:53:56.606]  Way more than you'll do for yourself.
[02:53:56.606 --> 02:53:58.007]  Especially I think about my children.
[02:53:58.007 --> 02:54:01.930]  That's what motivates me to do what I do to spread the message of freedom and liberty.
[02:54:04.741 --> 02:54:05.942]  Well, you're just amazing.
[02:54:05.942 --> 02:54:08.604]  For radio listeners, you're not seeing this.
[02:54:08.604 --> 02:54:15.789]  I mean, this footage you shot, you were in the middle of this stuff for how many days?
[02:54:15.789 --> 02:54:17.750]  We're there for about nine days.
[02:54:17.750 --> 02:54:21.713]  But yeah, I basically, I was on the front lines waving my American flag to the police.
[02:54:21.713 --> 02:54:33.742]  They didn't like it, but everyone else did because it was like, there's an American with us on the front lines promoting freedom with us, you know, and that means a lot to them because they feel alone.
[02:54:34.341 --> 02:54:35.041]  That's the thing.
[02:54:35.041 --> 02:54:36.141]  All they have is each other.
[02:54:36.141 --> 02:54:38.602]  They feel alone, and they're begging for help.
[02:54:38.602 --> 02:54:41.843]  Not necessarily military help, because I don't think we can... I don't think that's a good idea.
[02:54:41.843 --> 02:54:44.483]  They just want political pressure.
[02:54:44.483 --> 02:54:45.604]  Political pressure.
[02:54:45.604 --> 02:54:46.644]  They want the support.
[02:54:46.644 --> 02:54:50.965]  They want... If the world pulls together for them, it will help them a lot.
[02:54:50.965 --> 02:54:55.406]  Both morally and... Well, they know the party officials are going to come in and take everything they've raised, everything they've done.
[02:54:55.406 --> 02:54:58.147]  And they know they're taking people's organs and killing whoever they want.
[02:54:58.147 --> 02:55:02.308]  I mean, they know an evil, demonic mafia is about to fully take them over.
[02:55:02.308 --> 02:55:03.488]  Why wouldn't they fight for their lives?
[02:55:04.875 --> 02:55:12.240]  Yeah, they have, the internet is uncensored right now in Hong Kong, and so they know exactly what's happening in China.
[02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:16.844]  They know everything that you know, Alex, everything that you've been talking about, they talk about and they know.
[02:55:16.844 --> 02:55:23.629]  They talk about harvesting the organs, they talk about the executions, they talk about the concentration camps.
[02:55:23.629 --> 02:55:24.770]  They know all of that, so yeah.
[02:55:24.770 --> 02:55:29.933]  And these are real concentration camps, not the made-up ones from AOC.
[02:55:29.933 --> 02:55:30.354]  Real ones.
[02:55:31.531 --> 02:55:33.512]  One's that have millions of Muslims in them.
[02:55:33.512 --> 02:55:35.674]  Like, this is the real deal!
[02:55:35.674 --> 02:55:38.195]  Right now, but nobody talks about it.
[02:55:38.195 --> 02:55:45.880]  And the thing is, too, is there's people in America who's been speaking out against China, and China goes after them.
[02:55:45.880 --> 02:55:47.501]  They will hack their computers.
[02:55:47.501 --> 02:55:50.923]  There's one... It's already happened to us.
[02:55:50.923 --> 02:55:53.605]  I mean, that's who funds Hollywood, the whole nine yards is the Chicons.
[02:55:55.626 --> 02:56:14.838]  There's a woman who's been speaking out against Chyna and Chyna got some photos of her naked and posted it everywhere with her phone number saying that she's a prostitute and stuff and she was getting tons of phone calls from people trying to buy her and stuff but this is the dirty tricks that they play and the thing is about Chyna is they're so afraid of the truth.
[02:56:14.838 --> 02:56:15.978]  So afraid.
[02:56:15.978 --> 02:56:17.259]  Well, they want to fight, Joey.
[02:56:17.259 --> 02:56:18.100]  They're gonna get one.
[02:56:18.100 --> 02:56:23.003]  I think they're biting on more than they can chew in Taiwan and in Hong Kong.
[02:56:23.003 --> 02:56:23.443]  What do you think?
[02:56:25.106 --> 02:56:26.267]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:56:26.267 --> 02:56:27.728]  And they don't know what to do.
[02:56:27.728 --> 02:56:29.509]  They're out of options right now.
[02:56:29.509 --> 02:56:34.612]  They know that if they send in the military, there's going to be outcry from all over the world.
[02:56:34.612 --> 02:56:38.274]  But at the same time, they kind of, they did it since Tibet.
[02:56:38.274 --> 02:56:40.656]  No one really caused any problems.
[02:56:40.656 --> 02:56:44.098]  They have... Yeah, well that's up on the roof of the world with nobody around it.
[02:56:44.098 --> 02:56:48.021]  This is right in the middle of the major shipping lanes, right next to Japan.
[02:56:48.021 --> 02:56:50.642]  And let me tell you, this is a very dangerous time.
[02:56:50.642 --> 02:56:52.623]  Joey, I'm very impressed, always with your great work.
[02:56:53.664 --> 02:56:56.226]  Please come on David Knight's show tomorrow morning.
[02:56:56.226 --> 02:57:03.030]  If you can, please come on The War Room today or tomorrow because I want you to host or co-host the whole hour because I know you've got so much footage.
[02:57:03.030 --> 02:57:08.493]  How much footage do you have and where else other than obviously this live show do we find it?
[02:57:08.493 --> 02:57:12.235]  Do folks go to your website, gibsonforfreedom.com?
[02:57:13.959 --> 02:57:15.620]  Yeah, they go gibsonforfreedom.com.
[02:57:15.620 --> 02:57:18.682]  They can also look at all my videos on YouTube.
[02:57:18.682 --> 02:57:21.184]  It's Joey Gibson Pays Your Prayer.
[02:57:21.184 --> 02:57:25.427]  And we still have hours and hours of footage we haven't even uploaded yet, because it takes a lot of time.
[02:57:25.427 --> 02:57:26.668]  Well, it's amazing.
[02:57:26.668 --> 02:57:30.271]  You won't see that on CNN, because they're all promoting China taking over.
[02:57:30.271 --> 02:57:31.732]  So let the producer talk to you.
[02:57:31.732 --> 02:57:32.412]  Please come on.
[02:57:32.412 --> 02:57:35.114]  Either the War Room today, tomorrow, the David Knight Show.
[02:57:35.114 --> 02:57:36.395]  Wow, thank you so much, Joey Gibson.
[02:57:36.395 --> 02:57:42.579]  All right, I'm going to finish up a few calls as promised, and we're going to hand the baton over, coming up to Matt Bracken.
[02:57:42.579 --> 02:57:43.220]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:57:45.509 --> 02:57:53.314]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and most of them are funded by the globalists.
[02:57:53.314 --> 02:57:56.656]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[02:57:56.656 --> 02:57:59.757]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[02:57:59.757 --> 02:58:01.298]  I didn't invent all this.
[02:58:01.298 --> 02:58:07.862]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[02:58:07.862 --> 02:58:10.664]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been!
[02:58:11.721 --> 02:58:15.062]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[02:58:15.062 --> 02:58:17.983]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night.
[02:58:17.983 --> 02:58:19.683]  That sends chills up my spine.
[02:58:19.683 --> 02:58:33.227]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[02:58:33.227 --> 02:58:35.168]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family,
[02:58:35.828 --> 02:58:41.098]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[02:58:41.098 --> 02:58:43.523]  You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.
[02:58:46.514 --> 02:58:57.741]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists are backed into a corner, and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[02:58:57.741 --> 02:59:01.863]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[02:59:01.863 --> 02:59:11.229]  The world is going to change, and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails.
[02:59:11.949 --> 02:59:13.990]  The system is vulnerable.
[02:59:13.990 --> 02:59:16.671]  Electricity could be gone in an instant.
[02:59:16.671 --> 02:59:20.293]  And grocery stores could be empty in three days.
[02:59:20.293 --> 02:59:27.196]  Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the next level.
[02:59:27.196 --> 02:59:32.518]  And being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a dying system.
[02:59:33.158 --> 02:59:38.382]  Buy storable foods and an Alexa Pure Gravity Water Filter today.
[02:59:38.382 --> 02:59:41.324]  Support mankind by being prepared.

[02:59:49.310 --> 02:59:51.972]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:07.237 --> 03:00:09.478]  Article up on InfoWars.com.
[03:00:09.478 --> 03:00:11.538]  Soph just got banned by YouTube.
[03:00:11.538 --> 03:00:13.858]  Everyone will be banned.
[03:00:13.858 --> 03:00:16.679]  Even leftists will be banned once they bring their collective in.
[03:00:16.679 --> 03:00:19.600]  It's an anti-human, post-human world.
[03:00:19.600 --> 03:00:20.860]  It's really amazing.
[03:00:20.860 --> 03:00:22.120]  We're not in a science fiction movie.
[03:00:22.120 --> 03:00:24.941]  We're in the future.
[03:00:24.941 --> 03:00:29.842]  The history of humanity's destiny is being written right now.
[03:00:30.945 --> 03:00:33.446]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[03:00:33.446 --> 03:00:34.326]  Thanks for holding.
[03:00:34.326 --> 03:00:43.390]  Wow, that was a pretty powerful interview with the head of the Patriot Prayer Group, Joey Gibson.
[03:00:43.390 --> 03:00:44.850]  Yeah, no, by all means.
[03:00:44.850 --> 03:00:45.631]  That was awesome.
[03:00:45.631 --> 03:00:48.992]  And that kind of speaks a little bit to my point.
[03:00:48.992 --> 03:00:52.273]  First thing I wanted to do was I wanted to plug a couple of products.
[03:00:52.273 --> 03:00:56.555]  I wake up every morning and I drink a shake of bone broth.
[03:00:56.555 --> 03:00:58.936]  And I also do the Turbo Force.
[03:00:59.608 --> 03:01:03.952]  And I just turned 44 years old, and I feel better than I felt all through my 20s.
[03:01:03.952 --> 03:01:06.394]  I mean, I just gotta say, that stuff is awesome.
[03:01:06.394 --> 03:01:07.035]  It supercharges you.
[03:01:07.035 --> 03:01:09.557]  Oh, and ain't it more awesome?
[03:01:09.557 --> 03:01:12.940]  The Bone Broth is this great crew putting up with me all week, and the listeners.
[03:01:12.940 --> 03:01:14.561]  But absolutely, Bone Broth.
[03:01:14.561 --> 03:01:17.704]  We knew that Bone Broth was the big, hot, you know, cutting-edge thing.
[03:01:17.704 --> 03:01:19.846]  So we went out and made the strongest one out there.
[03:01:19.846 --> 03:01:21.467]  So yeah, thank you so much for the support.
[03:01:21.467 --> 03:01:21.828]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:01:23.714 --> 03:01:37.724]  Well, you know, that kind of lends itself to what I kind of feel like is happening with me, especially in the last few years, is every day I wake up, I feel like there's just this big force just saying, kneel before Zod.
[03:01:37.724 --> 03:01:46.931]  You know, just like in the movie where they're just like asking me to kneel before this evil dictator who's just come to Earth.
[03:01:46.931 --> 03:01:50.193]  And what I feel like Zod represents
[03:01:50.800 --> 03:01:59.884]  At this point that we cannot kneel before is, you know, this whole notion that white people are bad and they need to be replaced.
[03:01:59.884 --> 03:02:08.888]  This is just constantly being forced on us that we need to have open borders and that people should just be able to come into this country and receive.
[03:02:08.888 --> 03:02:12.170]  And that's because the globalists want the post-industrial world.
[03:02:12.170 --> 03:02:17.232]  They want, they don't want the Christian idea of empowering and industry and life and loving.
[03:02:17.232 --> 03:02:19.253]  They want barbarism and collapse of civilization.
[03:02:20.672 --> 03:02:21.633]  And that's Zod.
[03:02:21.633 --> 03:02:23.233]  And that's who Zod is.
[03:02:23.233 --> 03:02:25.615]  And that's who I refuse to kneel down to.
[03:02:25.615 --> 03:02:29.516]  And I feel like they're offering me saying, hey, you can be successful.
[03:02:29.516 --> 03:02:30.497]  You can be popular.
[03:02:30.497 --> 03:02:31.598]  You can have money.
[03:02:31.598 --> 03:02:36.540]  All you got to do is just hate yourself for being white and renounce your Christian faith.
[03:02:36.540 --> 03:02:40.362]  And, you know, it's all part of the social media is part of it now.
[03:02:40.362 --> 03:02:42.363]  The Fed is part of it now.
[03:02:42.363 --> 03:02:46.105]  You know, I feel like the schools have been taken over by
[03:02:46.665 --> 03:02:47.706]  We're good to go.
[03:03:08.687 --> 03:03:10.108]  You evil, wicked man!
[03:03:10.108 --> 03:03:11.569]  How could you say these things, you know?
[03:03:11.569 --> 03:03:12.670]  And it's just like... Well, that's it.
[03:03:12.670 --> 03:03:19.714]  I mean, there's a total demonization of the existing order to bring an order that is absolutely devoid of God.
[03:03:19.714 --> 03:03:21.515]  Thank you, Mike.
[03:03:21.515 --> 03:03:25.057]  Judy says that the fight is against evil.
[03:03:25.057 --> 03:03:26.578]  The battle's not against flesh and blood.
[03:03:26.578 --> 03:03:27.218]  I agree with that.
[03:03:27.218 --> 03:03:29.099]  Josh debates tech censorship.
[03:03:29.099 --> 03:03:32.802]  William Barr, employer under attack at work, wants to plug products.
[03:03:33.834 --> 03:03:35.815]  We're out of time, though, but I can jam in.
[03:03:35.815 --> 03:03:39.077]  Caleb and others, you're welcome to call on the next show.
[03:03:39.077 --> 03:03:42.359]  I tried to get to everybody, but I always feel terrible when I can't get to everybody.
[03:03:42.359 --> 03:03:44.280]  Caleb in Arkansas.
[03:03:44.280 --> 03:03:45.260]  You're on the air.
[03:03:45.260 --> 03:03:47.321]  Go ahead.
[03:03:47.321 --> 03:03:49.002]  Hey, I appreciate you taking my call, Alex.
[03:03:49.002 --> 03:03:50.543]  Thank you, brother.
[03:03:50.543 --> 03:03:53.765]  Hey, I just want to let you know, you know, we know you're under attack.
[03:03:53.765 --> 03:03:56.146]  Everybody's always listening.
[03:03:56.146 --> 03:03:57.347]  We're under attack as well.
[03:03:57.347 --> 03:03:59.628]  You know, I work at a job where I'm out in the warehouse.
[03:03:59.628 --> 03:04:01.329]  I try to listen to you every day.
[03:04:02.136 --> 03:04:05.218]  I will be fired if my boss found out I was listening to you.
[03:04:05.218 --> 03:04:06.859]  I've been told that.
[03:04:06.859 --> 03:04:12.682]  They have... I'll end up with... And see, why do they care what's in your headphones?
[03:04:12.682 --> 03:04:14.243]  Because they want you to be a slave.
[03:04:14.243 --> 03:04:15.284]  They want to own your brain.
[03:04:15.284 --> 03:04:17.085]  Because I've got a warehouse, too.
[03:04:17.085 --> 03:04:20.146]  People can listen to whatever they want if they're at a packing or whatever.
[03:04:20.146 --> 03:04:21.527]  It makes their job fun.
[03:04:21.527 --> 03:04:24.029]  They're telling you you can't listen to me?
[03:04:24.029 --> 03:04:24.649]  Absolutely.
[03:04:24.649 --> 03:04:26.430]  And I'll come back, you know, my clipboard will be empty.
[03:04:26.430 --> 03:04:31.493]  I'll come back from lunch and I'll have a sticky note on there, Alex Jones, the nut, you know, because I got some stickers on my clipboard.
[03:04:32.236 --> 03:04:38.218]  You know, it's getting bad, and then, you know, like, right after in 2016, right after... Listen, I gotta hear this, Caleb.
[03:04:38.218 --> 03:04:38.639]  Stay there.
[03:04:38.639 --> 03:04:49.623]  I got Matt Bracken taking over, but I wanna... I wanna hear from you about this, because... This is cult level, where they're telling you what you can and can't listen to in America, in your own head.
[03:04:49.623 --> 03:04:53.745]  If the warehouse says no audio, that's fine, but if... All warehouses, everybody has audio.
[03:04:56.087 --> 03:05:00.708]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.

[03:06:02.523 --> 03:06:10.006]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:10.006 --> 03:06:12.407]  And Matt Bracken is taking over here in just a few minutes.
[03:06:12.407 --> 03:06:16.449]  But first, the caller brought up this cult of bow to the New World Order.
[03:06:16.449 --> 03:06:18.690]  It's like Superman bowed to Zod.
[03:06:18.690 --> 03:06:19.090]  Here it is.
[03:06:30.649 --> 03:06:35.591]  There they are, all kneeling down to Zod.
[03:06:35.591 --> 03:06:39.492]  We're bringing back the silent movie here, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:06:39.492 --> 03:06:41.353]  We'll do a start of the next segment.
[03:06:41.353 --> 03:06:43.474]  That's the fun part about these computers.
[03:06:43.474 --> 03:06:47.355]  Okay, let's go ahead and go back to the caller.
[03:06:47.355 --> 03:06:51.817]  Caleb in Arkansas was bringing up the fact that
[03:06:53.675 --> 03:06:57.417]  He's at work, he's at a warehouse, and the warehouse has the rule, no audio.
[03:06:57.417 --> 03:06:58.458]  Well, that's fine.
[03:06:58.458 --> 03:07:05.262]  But I've got a warehouse, and if people are doing packing or whatever, they can listen to their audio.
[03:07:05.262 --> 03:07:10.106]  But the caller was saying, no, no, it's specifically Alex Jones he can't listen to.
[03:07:10.106 --> 03:07:12.607]  They want to control what's going on in his brain.
[03:07:12.607 --> 03:07:16.830]  This is the authoritarianism that's seeping into every aspect of life.
[03:07:16.830 --> 03:07:21.573]  So, Caleb, describe what this is like for us.
[03:07:21.573 --> 03:07:22.393]  It's ridiculous.
[03:07:23.797 --> 03:07:27.559]  At first it was like, no, we're going to take away all music and everything.
[03:07:27.559 --> 03:07:33.622]  And then it was like, okay, well, we're going to give music back, but no, no, no Alex Jones.
[03:07:33.622 --> 03:07:36.684]  No, you know, like I said, I can't even go into the warehouse.
[03:07:36.684 --> 03:07:50.251]  You know, there's a couple of the guys out here that agree with me and I have the same philosophy, you know, listen to you every now and then, but you even, even bring it up in the office or anything, or they mention it, or you're always crazy.
[03:07:50.251 --> 03:07:50.531]  You're,
[03:07:51.275 --> 03:07:58.708]  It's funny how, you know, the stuff the Democrats and the left is doing, like being pedophiles and all that, you know, that's all fixed in with them.
[03:07:58.708 --> 03:08:02.194]  They always try to throw that on you and everything else, like they say it's you.
[03:08:02.194 --> 03:08:04.698]  And it's ridiculous, really.
[03:08:07.642 --> 03:08:26.695]  Well, it just shows how once you push censorship and tell people that's how you get ahead, and once Facebook says, you can only say things negative about Alex Jones, all these managers and social climbers go, well, if I just start censoring people, I will get promoted.
[03:08:26.695 --> 03:08:28.317]  But they're just total followers.
[03:08:28.317 --> 03:08:29.457]  I appreciate your call, my friend.
[03:08:29.457 --> 03:08:30.998]  Art, I'm sorry to Josh.
[03:08:30.998 --> 03:08:31.819]  I'm sorry to Judy.
[03:08:31.819 --> 03:08:33.260]  We're out of time.
[03:08:33.260 --> 03:08:36.903]  Matt Bracken's taking over right now, former Navy SEAL, Patriot, best-selling author.
[03:08:38.123 --> 03:08:43.784]  Talk about the China situation, the Antifa, the articles on Infowars.com say they're going to terror attack more facilities.
[03:08:43.784 --> 03:08:45.084]  That's the official national group.
[03:08:45.084 --> 03:08:46.304]  No one's getting in trouble.
[03:08:46.304 --> 03:08:47.265]  That story's got to get out.
[03:08:47.265 --> 03:08:49.325]  This is totally insane.
[03:08:49.325 --> 03:08:52.706]  And then please don't forget we're doing a fundraiser right now, so we can hopefully expand some.
[03:08:52.706 --> 03:08:59.487]  I want to appreciate you for all your support already, but please think about how important this fight is and take action again.

[03:09:48.372 --> 03:09:56.814]  Coming up in T-minus 50 minutes, we're going to have Owens-Froyer and more today.
[03:09:56.814 --> 03:09:58.095]  So please stay with us now.
[03:09:58.095 --> 03:09:59.055]  Matt Bracken takes over.
[03:10:06.607 --> 03:10:15.252]  Okay, well, that last episode, that last section with Joey Gibson was really pretty mind-blowing.
[03:10:15.252 --> 03:10:26.919]  The idea that an ordinary citizen journalist can make that kind of high-impact video that he produced is just, it's really mind-blowing to me.
[03:10:26.919 --> 03:10:32.682]  And I think that this is a big part of the reason why the mainstream media is panicking.
[03:10:32.682 --> 03:10:35.844]  And I think that it's a big part of the reason for their censorship.
[03:10:36.658 --> 03:10:41.521]  You know, they're even censoring stories now on censorship.
[03:10:41.521 --> 03:11:04.437]  And in this hour, if he's set up, I have a filmmaker named Michael Hansen on to share with me today his experiences with his own independent filmmaking and how big tech has been moving to just absolutely crush him and destroy the ability of people to watch his films.
[03:11:06.556 --> 03:11:11.722]  Michael Hansen produced a film in 2017 called Killing Europe.
[03:11:11.722 --> 03:11:18.710]  He's an American of Danish descent, born in Denmark, but lived most of his life here.
[03:11:18.710 --> 03:11:25.238]  And he went back to Europe and he dug deep into both the European Antifa movement,
[03:11:25.934 --> 03:11:43.062]  And their allies in the Islamic refugee movement and the Europeans that both promote Antifa and this Islamic hijra kind of takeover invasion, a stealth invasion.
[03:11:43.062 --> 03:11:52.426]  And this video, which exposed really shocking things, eyewitness testimony by gang rape victims, etc.
[03:11:52.426 --> 03:11:55.488]  The video itself now has been taken off of Amazon.
[03:11:56.187 --> 03:12:09.790]  So, a couple weeks ago, Breitbart did a story on the film Killing Europe and his new film called Killing Free Speech, which is coming out, and I guess that the publicity that this gained him
[03:12:10.718 --> 03:12:31.350]  Because the leftists in the so-called Red-Green Alliance, this is the alliance of the communist antifas and the Islamic so-called refugees that are taking over in Europe and increasingly in the United States.
[03:12:31.350 --> 03:12:34.551]  They went to Amazon, had the film, you know,
[03:12:36.232 --> 03:12:43.916]  Declared, you know, Islamophobic or whatever, and the next thing you know, it's not available for sale on Amazon.
[03:12:43.916 --> 03:12:51.940]  It still is available on Vimeo, but it's becoming increasingly difficult, and they'll probably push it off of that, too.
[03:12:51.940 --> 03:13:01.764]  Now, there's nothing in this film that's obscene, that's violent, you know, other than just films right from the street.
[03:13:01.764 --> 03:13:04.486]  Yet, the film, because it is an effective exposé,
[03:13:05.419 --> 03:13:08.881]  Has been removed for sale from Amazon.
[03:13:08.881 --> 03:13:12.842]  And this hits pretty close to home because a lot of us depend on Amazon, right?
[03:13:12.842 --> 03:13:18.825]  I mean, it is the world's biggest marketplace now, by far.
[03:13:18.825 --> 03:13:21.026]  Is Michael Hansen set up to go?
[03:13:21.026 --> 03:13:24.428]  Do we have Michael?
[03:13:24.428 --> 03:13:24.908]  Yeah.
[03:13:25.967 --> 03:13:44.672]  Let's bring Michael on, and without my taking his time this week, we can talk about his upbringing with Antifa, both in Europe and America, and how he turned against it, and what he can tell us now about this threat to our republic.
[03:13:44.672 --> 03:13:45.432]  Michael, are you there?
[03:13:45.432 --> 03:13:45.852]  Let's go.
[03:13:45.852 --> 03:13:47.432]  Yeah, I'm here.
[03:13:47.432 --> 03:13:49.353]  How's it going, man?
[03:13:49.353 --> 03:13:50.093]  Yeah, good, thanks.
[03:13:50.595 --> 03:13:58.459]  Yeah, it's a little bit awkward doing this Skype to Skype, but we'll get through it.
[03:13:58.459 --> 03:14:04.122]  Yeah, let's talk about what happened over the last couple of weeks with Breitbart and Amazon.
[03:14:04.122 --> 03:14:16.389]  Alright, so I recently released the movie Killing Free Speech, part one at least, and Breitbart did a story on it.
[03:14:16.389 --> 03:14:17.550]  They actually did three stories.
[03:14:18.761 --> 03:14:29.946]  And what happened was that they linked to my Amazon account as well because, you know, they mentioned Killing Europe.
[03:14:29.946 --> 03:14:41.671]  And lo and behold, you know, I think about three or four days later, I don't know how long it actually went, but I get an email from somebody saying, hey, where can we see the extended version of Killing Europe?
[03:14:41.671 --> 03:14:43.852]  And I'm like, well, you can see it on Amazon.
[03:14:43.852 --> 03:14:44.952]  And he's like, no, I can't.
[03:14:44.952 --> 03:14:47.013]  And then I went in there and sure enough, they took it off.
[03:14:48.173 --> 03:14:49.814]  Um, citing, uh, what was it?
[03:14:49.814 --> 03:14:52.434]  They were, what was the term?
[03:14:52.434 --> 03:14:56.096]  Something about iterating for their customers.
[03:14:56.096 --> 03:15:06.419]  I guess, I guess what it really means is, is that somebody important or a lot of people called in and complained because they said it was based off of customer rating.
[03:15:06.419 --> 03:15:10.720]  And yet the customer rating or satisfaction was five out of five stars.
[03:15:10.720 --> 03:15:12.060]  But I guess, I don't know.
[03:15:12.060 --> 03:15:14.461]  I guess something else went, what's happening behind the scenes.
[03:15:14.461 --> 03:15:15.642]  I have my suspicions, huh?
[03:15:15.642 --> 03:15:17.062]  Who probably said that emotion, but.
[03:15:20.720 --> 03:15:29.601]  Michael, how long was Killing Europe available on Amazon before the Breitbart article came out on killing free speech?
[03:15:29.601 --> 03:15:39.083]  Well, it was available for two years and it was made available right after it had aired on One American News.
[03:15:39.083 --> 03:15:46.945]  So, I mean, it's just funny how after two years, all of a sudden, you know, they find out that this doesn't quite
[03:15:47.361 --> 03:15:50.023]  Adhere to their codes.
[03:15:50.023 --> 03:15:53.405]  I sent multiple emails asking precisely what in the moon...
[03:16:11.656 --> 03:16:12.236]  We're good.
[03:16:30.501 --> 03:16:31.122]  Each month.

[03:16:52.740 --> 03:16:56.603]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[03:16:56.603 --> 03:17:01.607]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?

[03:17:22.683 --> 03:17:23.904]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:17:23.904 --> 03:17:27.827]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:27.827 --> 03:17:29.368]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:29.368 --> 03:17:32.330]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:32.330 --> 03:17:37.874]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:37.874 --> 03:17:39.075]  I can help you, too.
[03:17:39.075 --> 03:17:42.018]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:42.018 --> 03:17:44.239]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:44.239 --> 03:17:48.683]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.

[03:17:54.196 --> 03:18:02.258]  As we gather this evening in the joy of freedom, we remember that all share a truly extraordinary heritage.
[03:18:02.258 --> 03:18:08.479]  Together, we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told, the story of America.
[03:18:08.479 --> 03:18:18.301]  It is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they know is right and what they know is true.
[03:18:18.301 --> 03:18:20.701]  As long as we stay true to our codes,
[03:18:21.281 --> 03:18:33.548]  As long as we remember our great history, as long as we never ever stop fighting for a better future, then there will be nothing that America can not do.
[03:18:44.511 --> 03:18:45.632]  Infowars.com.
[03:18:45.632 --> 03:18:46.773]  Tomorrow's news today.
[03:18:46.773 --> 03:18:49.535]  Full power of the Republic in the name of Jesus Christ.
[03:18:49.535 --> 03:18:51.236]  Full power!
[03:18:51.236 --> 03:18:52.337]  Damn the torpedoes!
[03:18:52.337 --> 03:18:54.118]  Go straight at them!
[03:18:54.118 --> 03:18:54.778]  David Knight here.
[03:18:54.778 --> 03:18:57.720]  You can join me every Monday through Friday at 9 a.m.
[03:18:57.720 --> 03:18:58.821]  Eastern, 8 a.m.
[03:18:58.821 --> 03:19:01.263]  Central Time for The David Knight Show.
[03:19:01.263 --> 03:19:13.852]  We have the first independent news as it breaks every morning, but we'll not only give you the news, we'll give you the background, the context behind that news from a perspective that values our God-given liberties.
[03:19:14.272 --> 03:19:22.194]  We're going to take a look at those who want to do a detour around our Constitution, those who want to deconstruct our culture and destroy our civilization.
[03:19:22.194 --> 03:19:25.775]  So make sure you join us every Monday through Friday again, 9 a.m.
[03:19:25.775 --> 03:19:27.376]  Eastern, 8 a.m.
[03:19:27.376 --> 03:19:27.936]  Central Time.

[03:19:32.837 --> 03:19:36.879]  You can also find us on YouTube at Liberty Terrian and on Twitter.
[03:19:36.879 --> 03:19:39.859]  Live broadcast both of those places again, 9 a.m.
[03:19:39.859 --> 03:19:41.140]  Eastern, 8 a.m.
[03:19:41.140 --> 03:19:41.660]  Central Time.
[03:19:41.880 --> 03:19:56.646]  Again, don't forget to tune in to the David Knight Show on InfoWars.com forward slash David dash Knight dash show.
[03:19:56.646 --> 03:20:04.408]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:04.408 --> 03:20:06.989]  You are the one they called President?
[03:20:06.989 --> 03:20:07.190]  I am.
[03:20:13.937 --> 03:20:25.324]  Kneel before Zeus!
[03:20:25.324 --> 03:20:27.186]  You are not the president.
[03:20:27.186 --> 03:20:31.969]  No one who leads so many could possibly kneel so quickly.
[03:20:31.969 --> 03:20:34.910]  I'm the man they're protecting.
[03:20:34.910 --> 03:20:35.851]  I'm the president.
[03:20:56.472 --> 03:21:04.434]  Okay, folks, we're back.
[03:21:04.434 --> 03:21:09.476]  I'll tell you, you know, Trump, he's not the perfect president, but he's a fighter.
[03:21:09.476 --> 03:21:18.680]  And I don't know anybody else that's been as effective at trolling the left and causing them to really expose their true nature.
[03:21:18.680 --> 03:21:22.061]  Certainly Mitt Romney, John McCain,
[03:21:22.754 --> 03:21:25.095]  They just were get-along-to-get-along types.
[03:21:25.095 --> 03:21:27.075]  Go-along-to-get-along.
[03:21:27.075 --> 03:21:28.736]  And that's not what we need now.
[03:21:28.736 --> 03:21:30.696]  We need disruptors.
[03:21:30.696 --> 03:21:37.378]  And we are certainly entering an era of completely independent journalism.
[03:21:37.378 --> 03:21:43.239]  And that's why it's so important to keep channels like InfoWars operating.
[03:21:43.239 --> 03:21:50.841]  Because, as we've seen in China, eventually the censorship net is just going to choke us out.
[03:21:51.494 --> 03:21:54.717]  We see them fighting in Hong Kong on the streets.
[03:21:54.717 --> 03:22:02.583]  The least we can do is fight with your computer mouse or with your smartphone and keep the message going.
[03:22:02.583 --> 03:22:08.327]  To keep the message going, it means supporting the Infowars store, obviously.
[03:22:08.327 --> 03:22:11.470]  It also means supporting independent journalists.
[03:22:12.139 --> 03:22:20.105]  You know, like Joey Gibson that we saw in Hong Kong, they've all, everybody's got a Patreon or a Subscribestar.
[03:22:20.105 --> 03:22:24.408]  If you want to fight from your home, this is how you do it.
[03:22:24.408 --> 03:22:33.054]  You know, in the case of Michael Hansen, it's almost like getting back to USSR, Samizdat, self-publishing days.
[03:22:33.054 --> 03:22:36.717]  You couldn't find Gulag Archipelago in Russia.
[03:22:36.717 --> 03:22:38.198]  You had to really search it out.
[03:22:38.198 --> 03:22:39.459]  You had to copy it.
[03:22:39.459 --> 03:22:41.160]  You had to pass the books hand-to-hand.
[03:22:41.872 --> 03:22:44.034]  And that's what we're getting down to today.
[03:22:44.034 --> 03:22:53.100]  So Michael Hansen's films, for now, it's still available on Vimeo, but he's also setting up a website to sell DVDs.
[03:22:53.100 --> 03:22:54.201]  I was talking to him about it.
[03:22:54.201 --> 03:22:56.623]  He said, yeah, you know, old people, they're still into DVDs.
[03:22:56.623 --> 03:22:58.444]  I said, it's not just old people.
[03:22:58.444 --> 03:23:02.747]  It's people that want to get the message because it's being suppressed.
[03:23:03.388 --> 03:23:12.833]  So, getting the physical DVD is, you know, maybe you just can't find the video on the Internet anymore, killing Europe or coming up killing free speech.
[03:23:12.833 --> 03:23:22.519]  Or in the case of my books, yes, they're available as e-books and they're available in Audible, but nobody can delete an actual printed book.
[03:23:22.519 --> 03:23:29.763]  So you get the DVD in your hands, you'll be able to hand it out to friends, co-workers, and keep the message going.
[03:23:30.323 --> 03:23:33.506]  Okay, Michael, let's get back on topic.
[03:23:33.506 --> 03:23:37.369]  We're talking about the suppression of your films.
[03:23:37.369 --> 03:23:43.233]  Yeah, so it basically left off with Amazon shutting it down after two years.
[03:23:43.233 --> 03:23:54.902]  And I don't think it's a coincidence because Breitbart just did three articles on Killing Free Speech Part 1, which I just released to the public on YouTube.
[03:23:56.837 --> 03:24:01.880]  They linked to Killing Europe on Amazon, and I really think that's what got it shut down.
[03:24:01.880 --> 03:24:05.722]  All of a sudden, it's getting high traffic, and it's getting noticed.
[03:24:05.722 --> 03:24:12.286]  And obviously, anybody who appears on Breitbart will get the attention of the left.
[03:24:12.286 --> 03:24:25.574]  And you gotta remember that it's not the first time the left has noticed my films, because Killing Free Speech, I did actually a private screening with Border Patrol back in October.
[03:24:25.574 --> 03:24:26.294]  Or was it November?
[03:24:26.937 --> 03:24:33.778]  And after that screening, I don't know how, like some left-wing reporter got a hold of it.
[03:24:33.778 --> 03:24:35.018]  And she basically came out with it.
[03:24:35.018 --> 03:24:44.300]  A bunch of articles came out from different left-wing media sites saying that Border Patrol was hosting a white supremacist documentary, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[03:24:44.300 --> 03:24:48.241]  Which we all know, you know, that's just their falsehoods.
[03:24:48.241 --> 03:24:50.841]  But, you know, it puts so much pressure on Border Patrol.
[03:24:50.841 --> 03:24:56.402]  They were supposed to have several screenings in the Texas chapter as well, but they had to, like, cancel all of that.
[03:24:57.205 --> 03:25:12.949]  And not only that, the Union Rep told me that even the Democrats that were being endorsed by the Border Patrol were receiving a lot of heat because they had endorsed, so to speak, my movie by having this private screening.
[03:25:12.949 --> 03:25:19.691]  So, I think that as soon as the left then saw this on Breitbart, they went, alright,
[03:25:20.660 --> 03:25:31.407]  You know, we can't really shut down a movie called Killing Free Speech because that would be, I guess, a little bit too much up front, but let's try and hit Killing Europe because I personally think that
[03:25:32.259 --> 03:25:40.725]  If they can basically ban my movie, Killing You Everywhere, it's going to be that much easier for them than to go after Killing Three Speeds afterwards, if that makes sense.
[03:25:40.725 --> 03:25:46.609]  I mean, I'm just hypothesizing here.
[03:25:46.609 --> 03:26:01.819]  Once they accomplish the goal of branding one of your films as some kind of white hate speech, which obviously it's not, then they'll just be able to say anything by you goes right into the forbidden section.
[03:26:02.561 --> 03:26:03.181]  Anything.
[03:26:03.181 --> 03:26:06.743]  So you'll be tarred completely up, down and sideways.
[03:26:06.743 --> 03:26:11.126]  Which one of your films was prevented from being shown in a library in Canada?
[03:26:11.126 --> 03:26:13.267]  Tell us about that.
[03:26:13.267 --> 03:26:15.128]  That was Killing Europe.
[03:26:15.128 --> 03:26:25.073]  So back story to that is that, you know, I'm from Denmark and when I did Killing Europe two years ago, I wanted to show Killing Europe in Denmark.
[03:26:25.073 --> 03:26:26.154]  That's where I wanted to premiere.
[03:26:26.994 --> 03:26:36.136]  But needless to say, after contacting a few venues, they all said, no thank you, because they were afraid of radical Muslims and they were afraid of Antifa.
[03:26:36.136 --> 03:26:45.458]  And which, you know, I mean, just proves the point, because killing Europe is not only about immigration, it's about how media is suppressing all the news about the effects of mass immigration.
[03:26:45.458 --> 03:26:46.919]  So it's kind of ironic.
[03:26:46.919 --> 03:26:49.719]  But, you know, so Denmark was out of the question.
[03:26:49.719 --> 03:26:55.721]  So we figured, all right, well, what's the most harmless place you almost never ever hear about?
[03:26:55.721 --> 03:26:56.241]  Well, Canada.
[03:26:57.575 --> 03:27:00.718]  So we figured that would be a safe place to have a screening, right?
[03:27:00.718 --> 03:27:05.241]  Nobody's gonna even bother about what the hell goes on in Canada, usually.
[03:27:05.241 --> 03:27:12.447]  So, no offense to Canada, but... But sure enough, they had the screening set up.
[03:27:12.447 --> 03:27:16.290]  Antifa got involved as soon as they found out about it, and they complained to the library.
[03:27:16.290 --> 03:27:23.015]  Initially, the library said, because they have a big movie theater in Ottawa, they said, this is not hate speech.
[03:27:23.015 --> 03:27:26.538]  We have free speech, and they have a right to show the film in our theater.
[03:27:27.372 --> 03:27:34.037]  And then the police, the Ottawa police, even viewed the film and said, this doesn't violate Canadian hate speech laws.
[03:27:34.037 --> 03:27:35.838]  It's a go.
[03:27:35.838 --> 03:27:40.981]  But then some local politicians all of a sudden got involved, Tim Tierney to be precise.
[03:27:40.981 --> 03:27:50.548]  And this all happened after a so-called human rights lawyer called Richard Warman, who is basically a serial human rights lawsuit guy.
[03:27:50.548 --> 03:27:54.170]  Like, he uses the human rights course, the community must go after anybody.
[03:27:54.170 --> 03:27:54.971]  If you're from Canada,
[03:27:55.339 --> 03:27:57.300]  And you're into politics, you know who Richard Warman is.
[03:27:57.300 --> 03:28:04.483]  He's like some, some, he's like the, I don't know, here in the United States, I'm sure you've got... Like the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[03:28:04.483 --> 03:28:06.504]  Like the SPLC.
[03:28:06.504 --> 03:28:11.046]  Yeah, I don't know if they do lawsuits, but... Oh, kind of like CARE actually.
[03:28:11.046 --> 03:28:12.987]  They're the ones who practice lawfare.
[03:28:12.987 --> 03:28:14.888]  We'll get back to CARE.
[03:28:14.888 --> 03:28:18.950]  But the point is, is that after they got involved, it got shut down.
[03:28:22.183 --> 03:28:23.424]  We're going to a break in a little bit.
[03:28:23.424 --> 03:28:28.326]  I'm going to pull it back to transition.
[03:28:28.326 --> 03:28:45.074]  When we come back, I'm going to compare this in a way to the Tommy Robinson situation, where the people who are trying to highlight and showcase the abuses of girls, the trafficking, the gang raping, they're the ones who are called haters and have their material banned.
[03:28:45.074 --> 03:28:48.156]  We'll be back after the break and take it up again with Michael Hansen.
[03:28:53.812 --> 03:29:04.863]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder or legs, you now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill.

[03:29:55.702 --> 03:29:59.824]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:29:59.824 --> 03:30:06.126]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, and we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen.
[03:30:06.126 --> 03:30:18.331]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here, from the bottom of my heart, to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about people, that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[03:30:18.331 --> 03:30:24.713]  And so I feel very strong, and I feel God's hand on my shoulder, and I feel your love in my heart, and I want you to know that love is right back
[03:30:24.753 --> 03:30:26.414]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:30:54.158 --> 03:31:02.366]  Before I started working at InfoWars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and InfoWars.com, but also the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:31:02.366 --> 03:31:09.112]  And there's one product that's offered at InfoWarsStore.com that is the elite of the supplements, and that's DNA Force+.
[03:31:09.713 --> 03:31:13.657]  Now I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests.
[03:31:13.657 --> 03:31:17.501]  Telomeres and telomere support with your DNA.
[03:31:17.501 --> 03:31:25.930]  So I started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres.
[03:31:25.930 --> 03:31:28.053]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus but
[03:31:28.573 --> 03:31:29.334]  It's expensive.
[03:31:29.334 --> 03:31:29.654]  Why?
[03:31:29.654 --> 03:31:32.436]  Because it is an elite supplement.
[03:31:32.436 --> 03:31:39.722]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support, and they came and they went.
[03:31:39.722 --> 03:31:42.765]  But DNA Force Plus is still there.
[03:31:42.765 --> 03:31:44.446]  It is the elite supplement.
[03:31:44.446 --> 03:31:48.109]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive.
[03:31:48.109 --> 03:31:53.974]  So you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:31:54.774 --> 03:32:10.663]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square, the other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[03:32:10.663 --> 03:32:12.384]  It is completely independent of all that.
[03:32:12.384 --> 03:32:13.985]  It is an old-school American
[03:32:13.985 --> 03:32:14.686]  We're good to go.
[03:32:43.388 --> 03:32:45.569]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:16.807 --> 03:33:19.168]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:19.168 --> 03:33:27.032]  It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[03:33:27.032 --> 03:33:46.182]  Okay, I'm back with Michael Hansen and we're talking about... Well, we were going to be talking about Antifa and the Red-Green Alliance, but it seems like the message is so dangerous to the big tech, mainstream media, the globalists,
[03:33:47.210 --> 03:33:51.793]  That they won't even allow the subject to be discussed.
[03:33:51.793 --> 03:33:55.876]  And they certainly won't allow a film about it to be distributed.
[03:33:55.876 --> 03:34:02.922]  And that's the case where Killing Europe has been taken down by Amazon.
[03:34:02.922 --> 03:34:04.843]  Links go bad.
[03:34:04.843 --> 03:34:05.984]  It's very difficult.
[03:34:05.984 --> 03:34:07.985]  Becomes difficult to find.
[03:34:07.985 --> 03:34:15.611]  And this is the process of deplatforming and unpersoning somebody who is fighting for freedom across the world.
[03:34:16.357 --> 03:34:18.059]  You know, nation to nation.
[03:34:18.059 --> 03:34:31.931]  And I would almost compare this situation to Tommy Robinson, who made his bones highlighting the, you know, the not only Rotherham, that was the most famous case, but across the UK.
[03:34:31.931 --> 03:34:40.059]  Tens of thousands of English and British girls being being groomed, trafficked, and gang-raped
[03:34:40.831 --> 03:34:48.933]  And somebody like Tommy Robinson who highlights this and how the British police were essentially part of the cover-up.
[03:34:48.933 --> 03:34:54.794]  The British police would arrest the parents who tried to go find and rescue their girls.
[03:34:54.794 --> 03:35:01.276]  The parents would be arrested while the rapists would be let free or not even bothered.
[03:35:01.276 --> 03:35:06.117]  The complaint would be against the parents for harassing the poor rapists.
[03:35:06.756 --> 03:35:07.957]  Literally.
[03:35:07.957 --> 03:35:13.800]  And it took a Tommy Robinson to expose this, and look what happened to him.
[03:35:13.800 --> 03:35:15.100]  Now he's back in prison.
[03:35:15.100 --> 03:35:30.648]  You know, Michael Hansen's not in prison, but here he is, a filmmaker, takes his own equipment, goes out, creates and produces these really epic films, and as soon as they start getting any notice or traction, they're crushed.
[03:35:31.477 --> 03:35:38.379]  And it's very discouraging, but, you know, we're talking today about how we can fight back.
[03:35:38.379 --> 03:35:42.180]  I'm sorry, Michael, I get passionate about this.
[03:35:42.180 --> 03:35:43.201]  Where do we go from here?
[03:35:43.201 --> 03:35:47.942]  Well, I mean, I just wanted to wrap up with the Amazon thing.
[03:35:47.942 --> 03:35:49.603]  I mean, Canada is Canada.
[03:35:49.603 --> 03:35:52.964]  They even tried to bring a human rights complaint against us.
[03:35:52.964 --> 03:35:59.786]  But anyways, my thing was that I understood Canada is basically turning into Europe like this Orwellian
[03:36:00.393 --> 03:36:05.478]  Control Society, but I always thought of the US as like the beacon of freedom.
[03:36:05.478 --> 03:36:09.001]  We have free speech, first amendment protections.
[03:36:09.001 --> 03:36:11.103]  But then this happens after the Breitbart articles.
[03:36:11.103 --> 03:36:25.856]  But what I don't know, I think I told you, or maybe not I told you, that after Breitbart writes the article about how Amazon took Killing Europe down, they put a link to Killing Europe on YouTube.
[03:36:26.770 --> 03:36:30.532]  And a couple of days after they did that, a bunch of people did the same thing.
[03:36:30.532 --> 03:36:33.114]  They put links and wrote articles about it, right?
[03:36:33.114 --> 03:36:45.981]  Now, if you click on any links that talks about Danish filmmaker killing Europe, taken down from Amazon, and you go in there and you want to watch the Killing Europe YouTube link, you'll see that it's been removed because it violated content.
[03:36:45.981 --> 03:36:54.466]  So, two days later, after Breitbart's article about the Amazon takedown, YouTube goes in now and takes down Killing Europe.
[03:36:54.466 --> 03:36:54.946]  Go figure.
[03:36:55.626 --> 03:36:59.589]  You know, free speech is not really that much free anymore here in America.
[03:36:59.589 --> 03:37:08.975]  And, uh, I want to bring it back to, it ties into the reason why they're doing it, I really think it's because of the movie I made, Killing Free Speech Part 1.
[03:37:08.975 --> 03:37:20.222]  Um, because, you know, as soon as they get, as soon as they get, get Killing Europe completely banned everywhere, you know, it only takes one strike to then knock me off of YouTube.
[03:37:20.222 --> 03:37:21.403]  You get what I'm saying?
[03:37:21.403 --> 03:37:23.264]  And I think ultimately that's what they want to do.
[03:37:23.663 --> 03:37:34.369]  They want to kill off this Killing Free Speech before the next election, basically, because there's a Killing Free Speech Part 2 coming out in October.
[03:37:34.369 --> 03:37:36.450]  And this is part of a pattern, obviously.
[03:37:36.450 --> 03:37:42.153]  I call this like a full spectrum operation.
[03:37:43.928 --> 03:38:00.240]  Before you become famous enough to say, you know, get on Fox News, they want to just crush you and tar you to the point where, say, a Fox News would never touch you because you'll be in an icky band, you know, hate speech category.
[03:38:00.560 --> 03:38:00.880]  I think?
[03:38:17.761 --> 03:38:30.985]  Lately, like in the last week, One American News Network is suing the Daily Beast and MSNBC because they were doing sort of the same thing against One American News.
[03:38:30.985 --> 03:38:40.728]  They were saying that One American News is a Russian operation, you know, that it uses Russian reporters or, you know, that it's a Putin operation.
[03:38:40.728 --> 03:38:42.469]  And this is a way of
[03:38:43.601 --> 03:38:48.483]  Putting One American News outside of, you know, the respectable mainstream media.
[03:38:48.483 --> 03:38:55.627]  So anything that you see on One American News is supposed to be branded as unreliable, you know, just Russian propaganda.
[03:38:55.627 --> 03:39:04.251]  And in the same way, anything by Michael Hansen is going to be called, you know, hate speech, like his band Killing Europe movie.
[03:39:04.251 --> 03:39:07.192]  And it's so ironic because Killing Europe is about
[03:39:07.732 --> 03:39:13.934]  Well, it's about who is killing Europe now, but if you can't understand what's going on, you can't save Europe.
[03:39:13.934 --> 03:39:22.656]  This would be like a filmmaker in the 1930s who's banned from writing about the Nazi Party because it hurts Germans' feelings.
[03:39:22.656 --> 03:39:31.918]  You show a concentration camp and they say, that's propaganda, you're making the Germans feel bad, and we're not going to allow your film to be shown.
[03:39:32.498 --> 03:39:39.102]  I mean, at least in that era, we were allowed to shine a light on what was happening in Europe.
[03:39:39.102 --> 03:39:40.563]  But today, no.
[03:39:40.563 --> 03:39:44.605]  The enemy is coming in and we're not even allowed to show it.
[03:39:44.605 --> 03:39:50.629]  Well, what just surprises me is that this is happening here in America now.
[03:39:50.629 --> 03:39:52.630]  I really never thought this was going to happen here.
[03:39:52.630 --> 03:39:58.373]  And in many ways, killing Europe was a warning to the United States.
[03:39:58.373 --> 03:39:58.914]  You know what I mean?
[03:39:59.909 --> 03:40:01.650]  You know, you don't want to be like Europe.
[03:40:01.650 --> 03:40:03.652]  Listen, take it from somebody from Denmark.
[03:40:03.652 --> 03:40:04.773]  You don't want to be Denmark.
[03:40:04.773 --> 03:40:06.294]  You don't want to be Europe.
[03:40:06.294 --> 03:40:14.581]  Because no matter what Bernie Sanders and all these other people from the Democratic Party tells you, Europe is really falling apart.
[03:40:14.581 --> 03:40:18.163]  And, I mean, killing Europe is the testimony to that.
[03:40:18.163 --> 03:40:20.725]  You know, I'm not some paid filmmaker.
[03:40:20.725 --> 03:40:21.446]  I'm not Michael Moore.
[03:40:21.446 --> 03:40:23.688]  I'm not anybody.
[03:40:23.688 --> 03:40:27.751]  I went back to literally the streets where I grew up, and I went all over Europe.
[03:40:27.751 --> 03:40:28.211]  This is my home.
[03:40:30.141 --> 03:40:34.543]  And people can't tell me that that's hate speech reporting what's going on in my home.
[03:40:34.543 --> 03:40:38.926]  You know what I mean?
[03:40:38.926 --> 03:40:55.774]  We can see that it's a coordinated effort because when you have patriots in any European capital try to just have a meeting, Antifa will rush them and the police will basically escort the Antifa in and then use the water cannons against the patriots.
[03:40:58.729 --> 03:41:00.511]  Live video.
[03:41:00.511 --> 03:41:03.694]  Live TV.
[03:41:03.694 --> 03:41:08.619]  The Patriots will be getting the water cannons while the Antifas are escorted in.
[03:41:08.619 --> 03:41:10.121]  We see this over and over again.
[03:41:10.121 --> 03:41:14.646]  Or we see that the German television, state television, had reporters
[03:41:15.339 --> 03:41:24.586]  Probably also, you know, Intel operatives on this Sea-Watch 3 ship that was bringing the African refugees to Italy.
[03:41:24.586 --> 03:41:26.388]  This is all part of a German program.
[03:41:26.388 --> 03:41:32.853]  I mean, this is official German state TV working hand-in-glove with the human traffickers.
[03:41:32.853 --> 03:41:41.720]  So if we elect somebody like, you know, from the left in this country, it's not only going to be open borders, it's going to be escorting in the train loads.
[03:41:43.186 --> 03:41:49.768]  What I'd like to say is that the United States is about 15-20 years behind Europe in many aspects.
[03:41:49.768 --> 03:42:01.793]  Going back to Antifa, I've explained to people over and over again that Antifa is doing the dirty work that the European governments can't do because they still have some kind of rights in Europe, right?
[03:42:01.793 --> 03:42:10.576]  But they're paid indirectly by the local city councils that are dominated by the left through their... I told you on the last show, through these community houses and what have you.
[03:42:11.545 --> 03:42:12.706]  And they're getting funded.
[03:42:12.706 --> 03:42:14.327]  Over here, they're funded by Joe Soros.
[03:42:14.327 --> 03:42:15.588]  I think that's an obvious fact.
[03:42:15.588 --> 03:42:18.069]  But what I want to point out is this.
[03:42:18.069 --> 03:42:23.073]  I mean, look at the sanctuary cities where everybody has sanctuary except for conservatives, right?
[03:42:23.073 --> 03:42:27.876]  Look at, I mean, at these protests where people, where the police get a stand down order.
[03:42:27.876 --> 03:42:32.939]  The only reason why they're getting that stand down order is so Antifa can do what they do.
[03:42:32.939 --> 03:42:36.041]  You know, intimidate people to stay away from anything that looks like
[03:42:36.536 --> 03:42:40.100]  And we'll get the perception that there's actually people against us.
[03:42:40.100 --> 03:42:41.601]  Like Portland.
[03:42:41.601 --> 03:42:43.423]  Portland is the pattern for the future.
[03:42:43.423 --> 03:42:45.785]  Portland is Europe and Portland is the future.
[03:42:45.785 --> 03:42:52.692]  When we come back, we're going to talk more about Antifa and what we can do to fight this growing terrorism from the left.
[03:42:53.703 --> 03:42:55.705]  Robert Morris, what has Big Tech become?
[03:42:55.705 --> 03:42:57.727]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[03:42:57.727 --> 03:43:04.233]  And the way they did so is because they face no consequence, social, economic, political or legal, for their illicit activities over two decades.
[03:43:04.233 --> 03:43:15.384]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to
[03:43:15.424 --> 03:43:15.844]  We're good to go.
[03:43:43.602 --> 03:43:44.922]  Serving with InfoWars is a great honor.
[03:43:44.922 --> 03:43:46.163]  But I still need my morning coffee.
[03:44:00.020 --> 03:44:09.425]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.

[03:44:55.296 --> 03:45:11.840]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements, in that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are, and how they were the best, and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[03:45:11.960 --> 03:45:16.043]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll shut us down.
[03:45:16.043 --> 03:45:19.745]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they work.
[03:45:19.745 --> 03:45:21.487]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[03:45:21.487 --> 03:45:24.389]  Jones sells unapproved supplements.
[03:45:24.389 --> 03:45:25.730]  And he claims they're supplements.
[03:45:25.730 --> 03:45:33.655]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[03:45:33.695 --> 03:45:36.377]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[03:45:36.377 --> 03:45:41.280]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[03:45:41.280 --> 03:45:42.460]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[03:45:42.460 --> 03:45:43.461]  They have side effects.
[03:45:43.461 --> 03:45:44.361]  Not with Mother Nature.
[03:45:44.361 --> 03:45:48.064]  But Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.

[03:46:57.183 --> 03:46:59.786]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:13.974 --> 03:47:20.795]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:20.795 --> 03:47:27.097]  And now, your host, Matt Bracken.
[03:47:27.097 --> 03:47:31.018]  Okay, I'm back with Michael Hansen for the last segment.
[03:47:31.018 --> 03:47:42.280]  You know, this is really a full-spectrum operation to censor conservatives, libertarians, people on the right, freedom-oriented people.
[03:47:43.462 --> 03:47:49.330]  At the top, you can see it with Google and YouTube, Facebook.
[03:47:49.330 --> 03:47:51.553]  That's the tech wing.
[03:47:51.553 --> 03:47:53.715]  Then you've got left-wing governments.
[03:47:53.715 --> 03:48:01.686]  Fortunately, we have President Trump, but across Europe, they're working hand-in-glove with Google to censor what their own people can see.
[03:48:02.612 --> 03:48:17.331]  Uh, and then you get down to the municipal level where, where you'll see left-wing mayors and city councils giving police essentially stand-down orders, allowing their local antifas to be the street thug arm so that
[03:48:17.910 --> 03:48:24.775]  Conservatives are basically afraid to come out and show their colors, show their flag.
[03:48:24.775 --> 03:48:29.998]  So it can be portrayed on television that only the left wing ever comes out.
[03:48:29.998 --> 03:48:31.640]  They must be the only ones that care.
[03:48:31.640 --> 03:48:39.125]  Now, you can see that this is false because when Trump has a rally, you know, 15 or 20,000 people will pack an arena.
[03:48:39.685 --> 03:48:45.229]  But if it's a rally downtown in an open park, people are literally afraid.
[03:48:45.229 --> 03:48:52.154]  Because they know that the Antifas can smash them on the head with a bicycle lock, while the police are nowhere to be found.
[03:48:52.154 --> 03:48:59.960]  And this is something that both of Michael Hansen's films, Killing Europe and Killing Free Speech, have dealt with.
[03:49:00.586 --> 03:49:09.253]  And Michael Hansen has a lot of experience with this, embedding with Antifa in his youth and as a filmmaker.
[03:49:09.253 --> 03:49:22.304]  And I'm not sure if we have any of these video clips of Michael ready to roll, but Michael, can you talk some about how you first brushed up against Antifa and what you're thinking about it now?
[03:49:22.304 --> 03:49:23.605]  Yeah.
[03:49:24.966 --> 03:49:34.609]  My initial experience with Antifa came when I was in my mid-teens because I played in a punk band and I was in the whole punk rock environment back in Copenhagen.
[03:49:34.609 --> 03:49:45.673]  And a lot of these venues that are funded by these local left-wing municipalities, they are kind of like the recruiting ground for Antifa.
[03:49:45.673 --> 03:49:49.674]  So, you know, I kind of got sucked into that whole scene because I was stupid.
[03:49:49.674 --> 03:49:52.315]  I was a teenager and I thought, hey, punk rock, right?
[03:49:52.315 --> 03:49:53.475]  And I brought a little
[03:49:54.045 --> 03:49:55.847]  I found this up in the attic.
[03:49:55.847 --> 03:49:59.691]  This is like a picture of me back when I was 17 and stupid.
[03:49:59.691 --> 03:50:00.492]  Let's put it like that.
[03:50:00.492 --> 03:50:03.936]  I keep it as a souvenir of how dumb you can be.
[03:50:03.936 --> 03:50:09.863]  And that kind of proves to me that probably most of the antivirals are just dumb teenagers like I was, right?
[03:50:09.863 --> 03:50:13.287]  But I very quickly found out that, wait a minute, this is not really that cool.
[03:50:13.740 --> 03:50:20.886]  So I very quickly left that scene and maybe joining the Danish Army kind of put me back on the right track.
[03:50:20.886 --> 03:50:22.627]  I think we have a segment.
[03:50:22.627 --> 03:50:25.270]  That's me as a young guy.
[03:50:25.270 --> 03:50:30.874]  I think we have a segment from killing free speech.
[03:50:30.874 --> 03:50:31.575]  Is that ready to roll?
[03:50:33.888 --> 03:50:34.969]  Let's go with that if we can.
[03:50:52.068 --> 03:50:58.690]  In spite of the heavy presence of Antifa, the mainstream media was calling these groups simply counter-protesters.
[03:50:58.690 --> 03:51:01.992]  On the other hand, they were calling the conservatives far-right.
[03:51:01.992 --> 03:51:05.833]  This is the same narrative and rhetoric being driven by the left.
[03:51:05.833 --> 03:51:10.935]  We want a world free from white supremacy, free from racism and xenophobia.
[03:51:13.439 --> 03:51:17.240]  And we think that believing in these things is what makes you an anti-fascist.
[03:51:17.240 --> 03:51:18.860]  But were the leftist right?
[03:51:18.860 --> 03:51:21.801]  Did I really ride in a bus full of fascists?
[03:51:21.801 --> 03:51:26.962]  And is rally organizer Joe Gibson a neo-Nazi and a white supremacist?
[03:51:26.962 --> 03:51:30.863]  I was really confused because Joe Gibson is of Japanese descent.
[03:51:30.863 --> 03:51:34.264]  So I decided to take a closer look at this rally.
[03:51:34.264 --> 03:51:37.685]  Are you one of those white supremacists we're talking about?
[03:51:37.685 --> 03:51:38.625]  Yeah, watch out for him.
[03:51:39.870 --> 03:51:42.252]  This was indeed a multicultural crowd.
[03:51:42.252 --> 03:51:45.654]  And yet, they were being labeled as white supremacists.
[03:51:45.654 --> 03:51:48.495]  What's your response to all their signs?
[03:51:48.495 --> 03:51:50.677]  I'm around my sisters and brothers here.
[03:51:50.677 --> 03:51:53.038]  I'm just having a good time.
[03:51:53.038 --> 03:51:55.019]  A good, peaceful time.
[03:51:55.019 --> 03:51:56.620]  Hopefully they stay peaceful.
[03:51:56.620 --> 03:51:59.502]  And don't cause too much trouble.
[03:51:59.502 --> 03:52:02.424]  I'm not even really paying attention to them really so much.
[03:52:02.424 --> 03:52:03.805]  Just don't turn into white supremacists.
[03:52:06.414 --> 03:52:09.775]  How do you view these guys as Nazis, fascists?
[03:52:09.775 --> 03:52:11.356]  White nationalists.
[03:52:11.356 --> 03:52:14.336]  White nationalists?
[03:52:14.336 --> 03:52:16.217]  What about the people who are not white in there?
[03:52:16.217 --> 03:52:21.018]  What do you say to that?
[03:52:21.018 --> 03:52:23.719]  How do you explain that one?
[03:52:23.719 --> 03:52:25.940]  Oh, man.
[03:52:25.940 --> 03:52:28.661]  No?
[03:52:28.661 --> 03:52:30.021]  Yeah.
[03:52:30.021 --> 03:52:30.381]  Go ahead.
[03:52:33.820 --> 03:52:43.085]  No, I was just gonna say is that that's what I learned when I was a teenager when I was inside of anti-fives, you want to call it that, is that there are bunch of hypocrites.
[03:52:43.085 --> 03:52:54.871]  I mean, and the point is, is that they just, they'll call anybody a racist and a Nazi because then that legitimizes their violence.
[03:52:54.871 --> 03:53:02.735]  And it's like, what's happened is that since the 90s till now, and also in the United States, is that the span of who's a Nazi is now everybody.
[03:53:02.735 --> 03:53:03.615]  If you're not like,
[03:53:04.073 --> 03:53:08.376]  Bernie Sanders supporter or an anarchist or Antifa, you're a Nazi.
[03:53:08.376 --> 03:53:17.003]  And that's the whole point is that a lot of these African Americans I was talking to, there's one guy I was talking to, people were standing across the street yelling, calling him a Nazi and stuff.
[03:53:17.003 --> 03:53:19.405]  And I'm like, seriously?
[03:53:19.405 --> 03:53:22.447]  It's just, but they keep on pushing that narrative.
[03:53:22.447 --> 03:53:29.553]  And the clip also explains this is that mainstream media, they could, they carry on that narrative that these so-called
[03:53:30.217 --> 03:53:30.737]  I just saw
[03:53:49.877 --> 03:53:59.623]  The Breitbart editor Raheem Kassam, the Labor Party in Australia don't want to give him a visa to visit Australia.
[03:53:59.623 --> 03:54:05.206]  They automatically call this guy, because he's a Breitbart editor, a far-right-wing extremist.
[03:54:05.646 --> 03:54:11.070]  So anybody who is not Antifa is a racist, you know, far-right extremist.
[03:54:11.070 --> 03:54:19.917]  Even if you're not a white guy like Rahim Qasem, you know, I think he's an ex-Muslim, they still have to just call him a far-right extremist.
[03:54:19.917 --> 03:54:23.199]  The left can't win the debate.
[03:54:23.199 --> 03:54:25.481]  All they can do is shut down the debate.
[03:54:25.481 --> 03:54:31.406]  And what they use now increasingly is what is what's called the heckler's veto, where
[03:54:31.966 --> 03:54:45.511]  If you're just trying to have a venue to have a patriotic rally, they'll make threats and then the police will ban the rally because the communists, the Antifas, are threatening violence.
[03:54:45.511 --> 03:54:54.715]  And it's successful because many of these cities, they have left-wing mayors that are essentially behind the scenes, they're working hand-in-glove with the Antifa.
[03:54:55.626 --> 03:55:07.176]  And, you know, hopefully they just have wrecked this misuse of the language so bad that being called a right-wing extremist, or even a racist, it's going to lose its bite.
[03:55:07.176 --> 03:55:07.677]  Exactly.
[03:55:07.677 --> 03:55:21.429]  But I just want to bring the point that, and this is ultimately the point of Killing Free Speech is that, you know, and what's happened with Killing Free Speech and Killing Europe these past few weeks just confirms, you know, what I'm trying to prove in this movie.
[03:55:22.791 --> 03:55:30.054]  It is, is that United States, you're a lot closer to going down the same path as Europe than anybody could ever imagine.
[03:55:30.054 --> 03:55:32.756]  You're one election away, really, because think about it.
[03:55:32.756 --> 03:55:41.880]  If you're next president, if that next president is Bernie Sanders or any of these people, you know, Portland is going to become the rest of the United States.
[03:55:41.880 --> 03:55:52.245]  And it's like, and I really think, to bring it back to, you know, what this whole discussion about banning all my films, I want to encourage people to go to YouTube, you know, watch Killing Free Speech.
[03:55:53.474 --> 03:56:05.861]  Part 1, and go to my website killingfreespeech.com because my bet is that they're going to try and target Killing Free Speech as next.
[03:56:05.861 --> 03:56:12.585]  I'm not surprised if that's going to get shut down within the next week or so.
[03:56:12.585 --> 03:56:14.967]  Where can people find your films now?
[03:56:14.967 --> 03:56:17.408]  What's the best way to find your films?
[03:56:17.408 --> 03:56:19.109]  Well, the easiest place is to go to
[03:56:19.830 --> 03:56:22.432]  Www.KillingFreeSpeech.com.
[03:56:22.432 --> 03:56:26.614]  There I have, like, most updated links to working links to my movies.
[03:56:26.614 --> 03:56:35.799]  But I encourage people to share the links from YouTube and post it wherever they can because, you know, I bet you it's going to be gone soon.
[03:56:35.799 --> 03:56:41.743]  And then, you know, and I will say that, ironically, Killing Free Speech Part 2
[03:56:42.853 --> 03:56:50.399]  You know, I went out with Border Patrol and we're dealing a lot with mainstream media and everything, all the censorship that's going on.
[03:56:50.399 --> 03:56:54.722]  And we even, we deal with Alex, the whole Alex Jones case.
[03:56:54.722 --> 03:57:02.008]  But what's ironic is that I'm now going to incorporate the censorship of killing free speech and killing Europe in my movie.
[03:57:02.008 --> 03:57:04.370]  You know, it's kind of ironic.
[03:57:04.370 --> 03:57:10.695]  And the thing is, is that, um, you know, when that movie comes out and I can give you a little spoiler here that
[03:57:12.531 --> 03:57:14.052]  30 seconds.
[03:57:14.052 --> 03:57:15.012]  Only 30 seconds.
[03:57:15.012 --> 03:57:22.236]  We're planning on a bunch of screenings at a bunch of universities in October, so I bet you they're going to try and shut this down.
[03:57:22.236 --> 03:57:23.937]  So go see the movie.
[03:57:23.937 --> 03:57:25.558]  Go place it wherever you can.
[03:57:25.558 --> 03:57:26.779]  Even rip it and post it.
[03:57:26.779 --> 03:57:27.540]  I don't care.
[03:57:27.540 --> 03:57:28.900]  Just get it out there.
[03:57:28.900 --> 03:57:29.421]  All right.
[03:57:29.421 --> 03:57:29.641]  Thanks.
[03:57:31.523 --> 03:57:40.255]  Great great topic today, and we'll see where this goes you know more more publicity will bring the hammer down harder I suspect but okay everybody.
[03:57:40.255 --> 03:57:41.597]  I'll see you next Thursday
[03:57:43.467 --> 03:57:49.393]  Last night, I'm on Infowars.com, and I read Chris Pratt criticized for t-shirt choice.
[03:57:49.393 --> 03:57:52.896]  It is literally the shirt that I envisioned.
[03:57:52.896 --> 03:57:59.523]  A Betsy Ross, but also another just classic American flag, all 50 stars, with the Gadsden snake superimposed over it.
[03:57:59.523 --> 03:58:02.365]  And on the back, America's back, Infowars.com.
[03:58:02.365 --> 03:58:03.887]  But what's better than just an American flag?
[03:58:03.887 --> 03:58:05.909]  How about a don't tread on me under the flag?
[03:58:05.909 --> 03:58:07.010]  Say don't tread on the American flag.
[03:58:07.110 --> 03:58:07.951]  It's a perfect combo.
[03:58:07.951 --> 03:58:08.991]  So great minds think alike.
[03:58:08.991 --> 03:58:12.753]  I mean, whoever designed that shirt, we'd already come up with the exact same, similar design.
[03:58:12.753 --> 03:58:20.238]  It is the Don't Tread on Me American flag t-shirt inspired by the triggering of leftist of the shirt worn by Chris Pratt.
[03:58:20.238 --> 03:58:23.740]  But it's a battle tattered flag, like the one that flew over Fort Sumter.
[03:58:23.740 --> 03:58:28.443]  And again, on the back, it says America's Back Infowars.com.
[03:58:28.443 --> 03:58:31.005]  4,000 of these babies.
[03:58:31.005 --> 03:58:31.525]  And that's it.
[03:58:31.525 --> 03:58:34.607]  So we've got the Betsy Ross version and the American flag version at
[03:58:34.787 --> 03:58:38.449]  InfoWarsStore.com being printed in the USA right now.
[03:58:38.449 --> 03:58:39.470]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:58:39.470 --> 03:58:40.470]  We'll be right back.
[03:58:40.470 --> 03:58:45.273]  The most banned broadcast in the world.
[03:58:45.273 --> 03:58:52.678]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[03:58:52.678 --> 03:58:56.940]  This is a digital AI-enforced gag order.
[03:58:56.940 --> 03:59:00.663]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[03:59:06.311 --> 03:59:08.032]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[03:59:08.032 --> 03:59:09.232]  This is racketeering.
[03:59:09.232 --> 03:59:10.353]  This is cartels.
[03:59:10.353 --> 03:59:12.774]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[03:59:12.774 --> 03:59:14.655]  We need it now.
[03:59:14.655 --> 03:59:16.336]  You can take on Big Ted.
[03:59:16.336 --> 03:59:25.280]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[03:59:25.280 --> 03:59:33.323]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[03:59:33.323 --> 03:59:34.184]  The way to fight back
[03:59:34.824 --> 03:59:39.668]  It's to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[03:59:39.668 --> 03:59:47.114]  Understand that if they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[03:59:47.114 --> 03:59:49.756]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
