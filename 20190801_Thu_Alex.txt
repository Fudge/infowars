[00:00.000 --> 00:15.480]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:15.480 --> 00:21.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:21.280 --> 00:25.320]  It's Thursday, August 1, 2019.
[00:25.320 --> 00:29.960]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from theInfoWords.com news studios in Austin,
[00:29.960 --> 00:36.480]  Texas, broadcasting worldwide and transmitting over the Internet in defiance of George Soros,
[00:36.480 --> 00:40.680]  Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and the NWO.
[00:40.680 --> 00:47.160]  Well if you're a TV viewer, you can see behind me there on the big screens what is officially
[00:47.160 --> 00:55.640]  being put out nationwide by the Antifa organization that is publicly funded by the Democratic
[00:55.640 --> 01:02.880]  Party and George Soros RefusedFascism.org, the same folks that did the full page of ads
[01:02.880 --> 01:08.400]  around the country saying overthrow the government, drive Trump regime from power November 4th.
[01:08.400 --> 01:10.720]  It begins.
[01:10.720 --> 01:13.480]  Remember that a couple of years ago?
[01:13.480 --> 01:20.960]  Well now they're organizing the violent attack on border control facilities in Texas and
[01:20.960 --> 01:23.960]  in the graphics that they have.
[01:23.960 --> 01:29.880]  It shows American flags burning, we can show the full graphic on screen, that'd be great.
[01:29.880 --> 01:38.360]  American flags burning, burning ICE vehicles and dead ICE officers with arrows sticking
[01:38.360 --> 01:50.680]  out of them in pools of blood, mall off cocktails being thrown and burning down the ICE facility.
[01:50.680 --> 01:55.080]  And we'll just go document cam then, document cam shot please.
[01:55.080 --> 02:00.200]  Border resistance tour, and we'll put this full screen on TV, this graphic in there.
[02:00.200 --> 02:05.680]  Border resistance tour, you can see the ICE people dead here in pools of blood, the burning
[02:05.680 --> 02:12.880]  vehicles and the mall off cocktails being thrown into the concentration camp looking
[02:12.880 --> 02:17.440]  facility with the American flag on fire.
[02:17.440 --> 02:22.320]  And then there's also a liberation theology nativist symbol being promoted by the Ford
[02:22.320 --> 02:26.240]  Foundation for native peoples to uprise and kill all white people.
[02:26.240 --> 02:33.720]  That symbol is then seen shining over the embattlements and the parapets.
[02:33.720 --> 02:37.600]  So we've got a big article on that going up at infowars.com the next 30 minutes.
[02:37.600 --> 02:42.640]  The Kit Daniels is working on, we first reported on this last week when Antifa announced plans
[02:42.640 --> 02:44.360]  to attack the facilities.
[02:44.360 --> 02:51.840]  Now red states reporting on it, Antifa says it's coming to Texas on September 1st.
[02:51.840 --> 02:57.160]  And that they are organizing on the hashtag that we'll be covering coming up next segment.
[02:57.160 --> 02:59.360]  Hashtag meet me in Texas.
[02:59.360 --> 03:03.840]  And of course they're praising the man a few weeks ago that fire bombed the ICE facilities
[03:03.840 --> 03:10.600]  in Washington state and was shot at police officers before he was killed.
[03:10.600 --> 03:16.080]  I am Antifa, he wrote his Antifa manifesto and said it is now time to uprise nationwide,
[03:16.080 --> 03:17.480]  kill, kill, kill.
[03:17.480 --> 03:21.560]  He said don't think, just start killing law enforcement.
[03:21.560 --> 03:27.360]  So and none of the AOC, four horsemen will say it's wrong.
[03:27.360 --> 03:30.640]  They've all been asked in press conferences.
[03:30.640 --> 03:33.920]  Seeing and others have praised Antifa is a good group.
[03:33.920 --> 03:45.080]  So we're going to be breaking all of that down coming up here on the broadcast today.
[03:45.080 --> 03:50.440]  And how it ties into flood of illegal migrants, they're not illegal aliens, they're migrants
[03:50.440 --> 03:57.160]  to the border outpaces last two years with 1.1 million expected in fiscal year 2019.
[03:57.160 --> 04:00.840]  And it ties into deter migrants.
[04:00.840 --> 04:05.560]  Trump administration pushes elaborate scaffolding at the border and off the books.
[04:05.560 --> 04:10.600]  ICE let loose 218,000 migrant family members into the U.S. since December and of course
[04:10.600 --> 04:13.040]  they're only catching about a third of the people.
[04:13.040 --> 04:18.600]  We have seen our border broken, but if you zoom right in on here, you can see again the
[04:18.600 --> 04:23.960]  bloody dead ICE agents and the pools of blood and the peace movement throwing them all off
[04:23.960 --> 04:33.320]  cocktail and again everything that the Soros funded group does, everything they engage
[04:33.320 --> 04:37.000]  in, refuse fascism, is meant to look real simple and black and white.
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.800]  It's all completely centralized and run by the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie and Rockefeller
[04:41.800 --> 04:44.240]  Foundation, the funding from Lord Soros.
[04:44.240 --> 04:48.040]  So it is the muscle of the meth head left.
[04:48.040 --> 04:56.120]  We'll cover this and so much more on the other side of Alex Jones, inforwars.com, tomorrow's
[04:56.120 --> 05:00.240]  news day.
[05:00.240 --> 05:04.440]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators.
[05:04.440 --> 05:05.520]  They are technocrats.
[05:05.520 --> 05:09.320]  They are control freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your
[05:09.320 --> 05:13.840]  own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge
[05:13.840 --> 05:14.840]  with AI gods.
[05:14.840 --> 05:18.480]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace, we're fighting them hard right here in the
[05:18.480 --> 05:19.480]  third dimension.
[05:19.480 --> 05:23.680]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control
[05:23.680 --> 05:25.960]  in our lives is our bodies.
[05:25.960 --> 05:31.240]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from ForrestLive.com, I couldn't do it.
[05:31.240 --> 05:35.600]  That's why we decided to take our original secret 12 that was incredibly high quality
[05:35.600 --> 05:41.320]  metal component and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[05:41.320 --> 05:46.200]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going
[05:46.200 --> 05:47.200]  to find anywhere.
[05:47.200 --> 05:52.360]  It is amazing, experience pure medical bottom and B12 for yourself and fund the second American
[05:52.360 --> 06:07.520]  evolution against the tyrants at inforwarsstore.com, inforwarslive.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[06:07.520 --> 06:14.480]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[06:14.480 --> 06:34.520]  front lines of the Info War.
[06:34.520 --> 06:38.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this August 1st, Thursday Global, incredibly
[06:38.960 --> 06:39.960]  important transmission.
[06:39.960 --> 06:45.120]  Don't forget, it's not just Alex Jones, it was truly this year from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
[06:45.120 --> 06:46.120]  every day central time.
[06:46.120 --> 06:51.600]  We have the David Knight Show, going out of my old studio, the old classic studio, and
[06:51.600 --> 06:56.520]  now he's moved into there with day mornings at 8 a.m. central and then Owen Schreuer at
[06:56.520 --> 06:58.200]  Adress with the War Room.
[06:58.200 --> 07:02.280]  And I'm about a year behind, but now in the next month or so you'll see several new shows
[07:02.280 --> 07:06.800]  that are going to be announced, guaranteed that's all locked and loaded, about to happen.
[07:06.800 --> 07:14.040]  Okay, if you're a radio listener, you might want to go to inforwars.com and newswars.com
[07:14.040 --> 07:15.040]  the next 30 minutes.
[07:15.040 --> 07:20.800]  We're going to have an article up about this with screenshots and links to all the documentation.
[07:20.800 --> 07:25.600]  But if you are a TV viewer, you can see all of this behind me.
[07:25.600 --> 07:32.040]  This is being officially put out by Antifa, funded by the Ford Carnegie Rockefeller Foundation,
[07:32.040 --> 07:38.320]  and of course, George Soros, all of their artwork is always meant to look childish in
[07:38.320 --> 07:39.680]  grass roots.
[07:39.680 --> 07:48.440]  It's always black and white, and it's run out of the Communist Party offices at refusefascism.org.
[07:48.440 --> 07:54.520]  And the leader of it, again, is an avowed supporter of Obama and of the weathermen and
[07:54.520 --> 07:58.840]  of all of these people, and he routinely goes on the Young Turks.
[07:58.840 --> 07:59.840]  He was just on the Young Turks.
[07:59.840 --> 08:03.960]  Like, let's pull that up, leader of Antifa was on the Young Turks, I forget his name.
[08:03.960 --> 08:07.080]  It was like a rat, white guy, old white commie.
[08:07.080 --> 08:11.760]  And he says, well, we're about to have a violent overthrow.
[08:11.760 --> 08:16.720]  But in the double think of these people, it shows individuals with peace signs on them,
[08:16.720 --> 08:23.680]  throwing Molov cocktails and burning up ice agents and ice agents laying around in pools
[08:23.680 --> 08:25.720]  of blood.
[08:25.720 --> 08:29.240]  And remember, they bought full page ads, The Washington Post, New York Times over the last
[08:29.240 --> 08:34.280]  few years repeatedly, this nightmare must end, the Trump-Pence regime must go, November
[08:34.280 --> 08:40.800]  4th, it begins, be there, join with thousands who will gather in cities and towns across
[08:40.800 --> 08:45.680]  the country, a move of protests that continue every day and night, growing until we become
[08:45.680 --> 08:50.440]  millions determined not to stop until the regime has driven from power.
[08:50.440 --> 08:55.280]  And well, now they're not just saying go to refusefascism, now they're saying go to
[08:55.280 --> 08:58.360]  their new website, borderresistance.com.
[08:58.360 --> 09:02.160]  They'll put that site up on screen for you.
[09:02.160 --> 09:09.960]  And they say that they're going to be meeting starting the last few days in Santa Cruz, Oakland,
[09:09.960 --> 09:16.160]  August 1st, Olympia, Washington, where they firebomb a facility, August 2nd, Portland,
[09:16.160 --> 09:21.840]  Oregon, August 4th, Seattle, August 6th, Minneapolis, August 7th, Chicago, and then
[09:21.840 --> 09:28.200]  they're all going to caravan down from Chicago down I-35, and they're going to firebomb
[09:28.200 --> 09:29.840]  this is on their main site.
[09:29.840 --> 09:36.600]  They're going to firebomb ICE facilities, shoot police officers in the back, and shoot
[09:36.600 --> 09:42.440]  people full of arrows, and burn American flags, which they're already doing across the country.
[09:42.440 --> 09:46.800]  So there you go, because they believe they're fighting Nazis, that they're Captain America
[09:46.800 --> 09:53.440]  fighting Red Skull, except they wear Nazi uniforms, are funded by a former Nazi collaborator
[09:53.440 --> 09:58.920]  towards Soros, and attack free speech, and throw them all off cocktails and shoot people.
[09:58.920 --> 10:02.320]  That was an anti-foot person that went and shot Scalise.
[10:02.320 --> 10:05.440]  He identified with them as well, like a baseball game.
[10:05.440 --> 10:13.800]  So they're getting ready to make their move, and they are a domestic terror organization.
[10:13.800 --> 10:18.720]  The definition of terrorism is to threaten violence or carry out violence for a political
[10:18.720 --> 10:20.960]  or economic end.
[10:20.960 --> 10:25.480]  And this is the very definition of it, I've been attacked by them, Owens had them point
[10:25.480 --> 10:28.720]  guns at him in Austin, the police did nothing, because it's a blue city.
[10:28.720 --> 10:31.040]  They were upset, the police didn't like it, but they said, we've been ordered to stand
[10:31.040 --> 10:37.160]  down by the new police chief, and they pointed guns and said, you're not going in the park
[10:37.160 --> 10:40.960]  for your control the borders demonstration.
[10:40.960 --> 10:45.720]  And they, I mean, Owens was within his rights to obviously physically take him out, but
[10:45.720 --> 10:46.720]  he didn't.
[10:46.720 --> 10:52.840]  But that's the level that this has gotten to, and just remember, remember, as Antifa
[10:52.840 --> 10:57.200]  says it's coming to Texas, that we got these documents a year and a half ago in January
[10:57.200 --> 11:00.360]  of 08.
[11:00.360 --> 11:04.480]  Documents to tell plan for civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore, Obama, through the
[11:04.480 --> 11:09.000]  Justice Department, it's in Antifa's own documents with Alexander Soros in command.
[11:09.000 --> 11:18.040]  You can read this, working with the Baltimore police to allow Antifa white college professors
[11:18.040 --> 11:22.920]  and government employees to burn buildings, attack police, to try to get the black population
[11:22.920 --> 11:25.080]  to uprise.
[11:25.080 --> 11:30.360]  So that's the view that they have of black people, is that they're mindless idiots that
[11:30.360 --> 11:33.880]  can be programmed and made to do what they want, but they failed.
[11:33.880 --> 11:36.280]  They got some rioting, but not as much as they wanted.
[11:36.280 --> 11:37.720]  They didn't get it nationwide.
[11:37.720 --> 11:41.600]  That's why CNN was on every channel saying, well, you know, police deserve to die.
[11:41.600 --> 11:45.320]  A bunch of cops got shot in Dallas, and a bunch of cops got shot in Louisiana.
[11:45.320 --> 11:49.960]  They said, well, police are doing bad things, so people are pushing back.
[11:49.960 --> 11:54.440]  In almost every case, it was where somebody pulled a gun on the police, and the media
[11:54.440 --> 11:56.920]  would lie about it, but the truth would later come out.
[11:56.920 --> 12:03.200]  This was all meant to stir up a violent revolution to keep Obama in office, but it failed, and
[12:03.200 --> 12:09.760]  I believe this will fail as well, but it's the same tactic by Soros and the UN in Europe.
[12:09.760 --> 12:14.480]  Turkey threatens to open the front gates to migrants entering Europe.
[12:14.480 --> 12:19.960]  Now, Erdogan said years ago, if you don't let me organize an Islamic party in all of
[12:19.960 --> 12:23.520]  your countries, I will overthrow you with migrants.
[12:23.520 --> 12:29.000]  So they capitulated to him, and now he's even sending more in millions and millions, and
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.320]  he has an alliance with the left.
[12:31.320 --> 12:36.880]  And so now Turkey Interior Minister has threatened to open the floodgates to mass migration to
[12:36.880 --> 12:41.200]  Europe, and see the more you take, then the more those outside groups can now parlay that
[12:41.200 --> 12:42.200]  into power.
[12:42.200 --> 12:48.680]  Warning, no European government will be able to survive for more than six months.
[12:48.680 --> 12:53.520]  Back in March of 2016, the EU agreed to allow Turkish citizens visa-free travel to European
[12:53.520 --> 13:00.520]  Union and begin a pathway for Turkey to join the EU in return for them stemming the flow
[13:00.520 --> 13:02.760]  of migrants into Europe.
[13:02.760 --> 13:03.760]  But they didn't.
[13:03.760 --> 13:07.360]  However, the EU has failed to deliver on the promise, and Turkey says they're going to
[13:07.360 --> 13:09.400]  break their promise.
[13:09.400 --> 13:13.480]  But the truth is, this has all been part of the larger plan, the weaponization.
[13:13.480 --> 13:18.560]  But don't forget, you've got lots of mentally ill people, like the man who firebombed the
[13:18.560 --> 13:26.960]  ICE facility who wrote the Antifa Manifesto, a total and complete cookball who believed
[13:26.960 --> 13:28.200]  he was fighting Nazis.
[13:28.200 --> 13:35.560]  You hear his manifesto, he says, don't think, just start killing.
[13:35.560 --> 13:40.840]  And they praised him all over Twitter, all over Facebook, and noticed Facebook still
[13:40.840 --> 13:43.960]  letting them push down to up to 1.8 million people that say they're going to storm Area
[13:43.960 --> 13:44.960]  51.
[13:44.960 --> 13:45.960]  Everybody goes, oh, it's cute, it's funny.
[13:45.960 --> 13:51.400]  But it's just everybody getting used to Facebook preparing masses of people like they did the
[13:51.400 --> 13:52.840]  Arab Spring.
[13:52.840 --> 13:57.240]  Man who firebombed government buildings, belonged to armed Antifa Group, promoted by CNN.
[13:57.240 --> 14:04.200]  And they even had a fundraiser on CNN for his organization that he was a commander of,
[14:04.200 --> 14:05.200]  heavily praised.
[14:05.200 --> 14:08.600]  And you look at the videos of him, and when he was talking to the 3%ers, like in this
[14:08.600 --> 14:13.720]  photo of 10 folks on the talk to him, he was completely delusional and believed he was fighting
[14:13.720 --> 14:16.600]  Red Skull.
[14:16.600 --> 14:19.720]  When there's anything close to Red Skull, it's the New World Order.
[14:19.720 --> 14:25.120]  Oh, we love bringing in the Muslims, the Arab Springs, they can kill all the gay people
[14:25.120 --> 14:29.720]  and throw women into slave pens, none of it makes sense.
[14:29.720 --> 14:33.720]  None of it's reality-based, like people with peace symbols throwing mall-off cocktails.
[14:33.720 --> 14:37.800]  They're like, oh, well, this is just some drawing.
[14:37.800 --> 14:41.800]  All of it's done psychological warfare style.
[14:41.800 --> 14:42.800]  Very, very skillfully.
[14:42.800 --> 14:43.800]  In fact, I even know the artist.
[14:43.800 --> 14:50.520]  I have a piece of their art hanging on the wall, the WTO protest in 1999.
[14:50.520 --> 14:54.520]  And I know the whole organization, the whole group, we've infiltrated them in Berkeley,
[14:54.520 --> 14:58.800]  we've infiltrated them in Austin, and you have board members, the University of Texas,
[14:58.800 --> 15:05.680]  people that chair departments, who literally are Chinese agents of Chinese intelligence
[15:05.680 --> 15:06.680]  who command them.
[15:06.680 --> 15:13.440]  Now, I told you that two years ago, a year later, it was in a Washington Post that UT
[15:13.440 --> 15:17.080]  Confucius Center shut down because it was run by Chinese intelligence.
[15:17.080 --> 15:19.720]  That was even in mainstream news.
[15:19.720 --> 15:22.240]  You cannot make up how dangerous these people are.
[15:22.240 --> 15:24.240]  That's why they all have, I'm serious.
[15:24.240 --> 15:31.960]  Some either wear shirts or have tattoos of Mao Zedong.
[15:31.960 --> 15:32.960]  There it is on screen.
[15:32.960 --> 15:33.960]  Daily Texan.
[15:33.960 --> 15:38.360]  UT must cut ties with Confucius Institutes because it's found they are Chinese intelligence.
[15:38.360 --> 15:41.520]  Oh, you have the Russians there.

[15:42.800 --> 15:47.480]  Russia can't even control its gigantic country three times the size of the U.S.
[15:47.480 --> 15:50.080]  Now, China is the one that needs resources.
[15:50.080 --> 15:52.120]  It's China that's taking over the planet.
[15:52.120 --> 15:53.520]  It's China that owns the debt.

[17:28.160 --> 17:30.040]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[17:30.040 --> 17:33.960]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[17:33.960 --> 17:35.520]  I sued the IRS in one.
[17:35.520 --> 17:38.480]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[17:38.480 --> 17:41.760]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[17:41.760 --> 17:44.000]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[17:44.000 --> 17:45.320]  I can help you too.
[17:45.320 --> 17:48.320]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[17:48.320 --> 17:50.560]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[17:50.560 --> 18:01.440]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[18:01.440 --> 18:08.800]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the western world history.
[18:08.800 --> 18:22.400]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order not to say the name Alex Jones or infowars.com.
[18:22.400 --> 18:24.120]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[18:24.120 --> 18:25.320]  This is racketeering.
[18:25.320 --> 18:26.320]  This is cartels.
[18:26.320 --> 18:28.840]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[18:28.840 --> 18:30.720]  We need it now.
[18:30.720 --> 18:32.400]  You can take on big tech.
[18:32.400 --> 18:39.760]  They saw infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family,
[18:39.760 --> 18:41.360]  populist organization.
[18:41.360 --> 18:46.080]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him
[18:46.080 --> 18:49.120]  off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[18:49.120 --> 18:54.240]  The way to fight back is to support infowars now more than ever and make it a standard
[18:54.240 --> 18:56.080]  of freedom and free speech.
[18:56.080 --> 19:00.320]  Understand that they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[19:00.320 --> 19:05.240]  David Knight here, you can join me every Monday through Friday at 9 a.m. Eastern, 8 a.m. Central
[19:05.240 --> 19:07.480]  Time for the David Knight Show.

[19:11.920 --> 19:17.520]  the news, we'll give you the background, the context behind that news from a perspective
[19:17.520 --> 19:19.880]  that values our God-given liberties.
[19:19.880 --> 19:24.120]  We're going to take a look at those who want to do a detour around our Constitution, those
[19:24.120 --> 19:28.440]  who want to deconstruct our culture and destroy our civilization.
[19:28.440 --> 19:33.800]  So make sure you join us every Monday through Friday again, 9 a.m. Eastern, 8 a.m. Central
[19:33.800 --> 19:34.800]  Time.
[19:34.800 --> 19:39.040]  You can find the program on infowars.com forward slash david-night-show.

[19:44.000 --> 19:48.000]  of those places again, 9 a.m. Eastern, 8 a.m. Central Time.
[19:48.000 --> 19:52.360]  Again, don't forget to tune in to the David Knight Show on infowars.com forward slash
[19:52.360 --> 20:03.480]  david-night-show.
[20:03.480 --> 20:33.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:33.480 --> 20:43.840]  Look at those headlines and the real Antifa publicly organizing terror attacks on high
[20:43.840 --> 20:45.760]  facilities in Texas.
[20:45.760 --> 20:49.920]  That's the new article of all the screenshots and documentation and kids adding even more
[20:49.920 --> 20:50.920]  information to it.
[20:50.920 --> 20:57.920]  And the live video feed is titled Antifa announces nationwide uprising, bloody terror attacks
[20:57.920 --> 21:05.040]  publicly planned in Texas and just two and a half weeks ago they hit a nice facility
[21:05.040 --> 21:11.680]  in Washington torching multiple cars, firing at police and Antifa across the nation officially
[21:11.680 --> 21:19.600]  called for more death and the words of their manifesto writer stop thinking start killing
[21:19.600 --> 21:22.160]  so liberal.
[21:22.160 --> 21:26.520]  In the flyers they're putting out, this is the official Antifa artist that does this
[21:26.520 --> 21:31.560]  on their site funded by George Soros, commanded by Alexander Soros, that's public, they buy
[21:31.560 --> 21:36.920]  full-page ads in the New York Times, buy the group, same group, people in peace symbols
[21:36.920 --> 21:45.640]  throwing mall off cocktails and burning up ice agents in pools of blood burning American
[21:45.640 --> 21:46.640]  flag.
[21:46.640 --> 21:52.080]  And across the country American flags pulled down the last few years, the last few weeks
[21:52.080 --> 21:57.760]  Mexican flags hoisted up Antifa publicly organizing terror attacks on ice facilities
[21:57.760 --> 22:03.200]  in Texas and there are big Native American movements at these universities being taught
[22:03.200 --> 22:08.720]  to kill the white man in South Texas and those groups represented here as well and they say
[22:08.720 --> 22:14.920]  that they are going to occupy the facilities, that they are going to burn them to the ground,
[22:14.920 --> 22:24.360]  that they are going to kill just like their leader, their new martyr, Willem Van Sprunsen
[22:24.360 --> 22:34.800]  said to do, stop thinking, get your guns illegally, these are quotes, start killing.
[22:34.800 --> 22:38.660]  Promotion shows US flag on fire, dead ice agents and again I'm going to explain this
[22:38.660 --> 22:44.720]  for the 50 millionth time because I know you know it but this article, when we publish
[22:44.720 --> 22:51.680]  this last January, a year and seven months ago all hell broke loose behind the scenes
[22:51.680 --> 22:56.680]  because we were sent by a family member whose brother got in a lot of trouble so they went
[22:56.680 --> 23:04.120]  in his house and found that he was a commander, an officer in Antifa and funded by friends
[23:04.120 --> 23:10.880]  of democracy, final operation order summary and this is the targets they are allowed to
[23:10.880 --> 23:11.880]  hit.
[23:11.880 --> 23:18.160]  Donalds, they have deals with Starbucks, Starbucks ask you if you are a bad person, they teach
[23:18.160 --> 23:22.320]  black lives matter, they teach that police are bad, well they have a deal with them
[23:22.320 --> 23:26.360]  where they are allowed to knock out their windows and burn them, that's why they don't
[23:26.360 --> 23:30.040]  get arrested because they have deals with certain blue city police, that's all in there,
[23:30.040 --> 23:34.840]  this was from Baltimore four and a half years ago, it's a blueprint to everything and they
[23:34.840 --> 23:39.200]  say you will go to this juncture point here at this time, you will smash these windows
[23:39.200 --> 23:43.360]  and set fire to this, you have been authorized, there will be a captain there controlling
[23:43.360 --> 23:48.720]  the police, so the captains are Antifa, this is so diabolical, you are talking about organized
[23:48.720 --> 23:54.520]  crime, it's like the mayor of Portland is Antifa, many of the police in places like
[23:54.520 --> 23:59.640]  Portland actually help Antifa, many are Antifa, some aren't but they are driven out of the
[23:59.640 --> 24:03.880]  departments, that's why Eric Holder wanted to federalize police, that's why they kept
[24:03.880 --> 24:08.560]  hyping up these deals with the feds to come in and take over local departments because
[24:08.560 --> 24:12.920]  of the opposite racism because they were going to have their people in charge everywhere
[24:12.920 --> 24:17.480]  and then once they have the police, you have a police state, once authoritarians, be they
[24:17.480 --> 24:24.040]  communists or fascists, just like Venezuela right now or Cuba or North Korea, Katie barred
[24:24.040 --> 24:28.360]  the door, then you have to go to a shooting war, well they have been killing cops and
[24:28.360 --> 24:35.160]  doing all this to put pressure on them the last few years under Obama to capitulate,
[24:35.160 --> 24:40.680]  he says agitators will inform operations when A O E C has approved the final distribution
[24:40.680 --> 24:46.200]  of funds, considering OPSET, it just goes through military terms, the information will
[24:46.200 --> 24:52.240]  be conveyed after the action, related through the same communications channels, using negotiate
[24:52.240 --> 24:58.040]  ops, and it goes through all the other systems and their contacts in the police department,
[24:58.040 --> 25:03.240]  you want to go read this, they all sign off on the battle action, they have the legal
[25:03.240 --> 25:11.240]  forms, they have the lawyer standing by, they have insurance if they get hurt, their job
[25:11.240 --> 25:20.240]  agitate the black population into uprising, where they are going to attack, what targets
[25:20.240 --> 25:29.640]  they are going to hit, it turned out Eric Holder was funding the entire Trayvon, Martin,
[25:29.640 --> 25:36.600]  George Zimmerman, all the made for TV movies and all the things they do, we commend the
[25:36.600 --> 25:40.400]  Lizards for getting this to us, and if you have anti-fun in your family, your husband,
[25:40.400 --> 25:44.400]  your wife, your sister, your brother, your neighbor, your country needs you to legally
[25:44.400 --> 25:48.960]  and lawfully get those documents and get them to us or project Veritas and send them to
[25:48.960 --> 25:52.840]  showtipsandinfullwars.com, and if you don't see a response right away, we get so many
[25:52.840 --> 25:59.040]  emails, sometimes they hit the spam filter, physically mail it to us, call into the office,
[25:59.040 --> 26:03.240]  send it to us, I know over the years we have missed a lot of stuff, that's why I say send
[26:03.240 --> 26:07.960]  it to project Veritas, send it to the daily callers, send it to red state, but just see
[26:07.960 --> 26:16.720]  it to everybody, turns out federal marshals and then state police years ago sent secret
[26:16.720 --> 26:20.120]  documents, how they were being trained that veterans and gun owners were the number one
[26:20.120 --> 26:25.600]  terror threat, no one would publish it but us, we published it, it was real the government
[26:25.600 --> 26:29.600]  had to admit yes, Obama is teaching police that Christians and gun owners are terrorists
[26:29.600 --> 26:34.120]  and that veterans are bad people, it's all lies, the FBI director is out putting that
[26:34.120 --> 26:38.640]  lie out right now as well, this is part of their cover for what they're doing, the uprising
[26:38.640 --> 26:44.800]  they're trying to form, they've got people inside the FBI, inside the ATF, inside everything
[26:44.800 --> 26:51.200]  and they've been trying this for a long term plan, but the article documents to tail plan
[26:51.200 --> 26:55.760]  for civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore, as soon as this live show is done today, I'm
[26:55.760 --> 27:00.920]  going to archive on our own servers this breakdown I've done in the last 30 minutes and we're
[27:00.920 --> 27:07.520]  going to post it into this original article and repost it on the front page of infowars.com
[27:07.520 --> 27:13.360]  but right now it is a maximum alert, anti-fou publicly organizing terror attacks on ICE
[27:13.360 --> 27:20.760]  facilities in Texas, promotion shows US flag on fire, dead ICE agents in pools of blood,
[27:20.760 --> 27:25.320]  they say we're going to launch a quote 10 day siege and they'll pass up Texas starting
[27:25.320 --> 27:31.440]  September 1st and they say that they are preparing with their border resistance to carry out
[27:31.440 --> 27:38.200]  the great work of Willem van Spronsen and his firebombing of the facility that indirect
[27:38.200 --> 27:46.200]  people on the page to burn down the facility and kill ICE agents, of course nothing will
[27:46.200 --> 27:49.840]  be done to them because the highest levels of the Justice Department are still under
[27:49.840 --> 27:54.800]  their control.
[27:54.800 --> 27:58.920]  Trump has said doesn't it them as a terror group, can you think if I was up here organizing
[27:58.920 --> 28:03.240]  and people in a group I had had already firebombed and already attacked people with metal bars
[28:03.240 --> 28:09.160]  and concrete and quick cretin, all the crap we've seen, you know how fast I'd be arrested
[28:09.160 --> 28:13.720]  for conspiracy to commit crimes, conspiracy to violate people's civil rights, to be able
[28:13.720 --> 28:17.760]  to demonstrate, that's what they go out and do is violate people's rights to demonstrate.
[28:17.760 --> 28:23.840]  I would be arrested within a week and I should be, but not them ladies and gentlemen, not
[28:23.840 --> 28:25.240]  them.
[28:25.240 --> 28:29.840]  They get to organize criminal activity and overthrow of the elected government in the
[28:29.840 --> 28:34.600]  full page ads of the New York Times, George Soros gets that money by the way to the State
[28:34.600 --> 28:39.240]  Department and Trump still hadn't been able to turn it off because it was already allotted
[28:39.240 --> 28:40.240]  under Obama.
[28:40.240 --> 28:43.560]  That's how that works, some of these things are done two, three, five years out.
[28:43.560 --> 28:48.400]  Now a lot of the money is running out, the couple billion bucks they had to run fake
[28:48.400 --> 28:52.080]  media and anti-Alex Jones stuff, that money ran out a few months ago, do you notice what
[28:52.080 --> 28:53.640]  happened?
[28:53.640 --> 28:59.360]  We are outlasted these murderers, but they're getting ready to launch some big ops.
[28:59.360 --> 29:04.280]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me, you don't know
[29:04.280 --> 29:05.840]  me and we'll never meet.
[29:05.840 --> 29:10.760]  I had a problem like you once, I drank and used to party a little too much till it got
[29:10.760 --> 29:14.080]  out of control and almost ruined my life.
[29:14.080 --> 29:19.320]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[29:19.320 --> 29:24.520]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[29:24.520 --> 29:30.000]  you need to call the National Treatment Advisors, they'll immerse you into a 30 day program
[29:30.000 --> 29:34.680]  to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[29:34.680 --> 29:39.920]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[29:39.920 --> 29:41.640]  What's your problem right now?

[30:00.560 --> 30:07.080]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists
[30:07.080 --> 30:12.120]  are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[30:12.120 --> 30:15.880]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[30:15.880 --> 30:22.800]  The world is going to change and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared
[30:22.800 --> 30:26.000]  to stay strong when the system fails.
[30:26.000 --> 30:32.160]  The system is vulnerable, electricity could be gone in an instant and grocery stores could
[30:32.160 --> 30:38.480]  be empty in three days, having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give
[30:38.480 --> 30:44.040]  you a fighting chance in the next level and being without puts you at the mercy of others
[30:44.040 --> 30:47.200]  or makes you a slave to a dying system.
[30:47.200 --> 30:52.720]  Buy storable foods and an Alexa pure gravity water filter today.
[30:52.720 --> 31:00.520]  Support mankind by being prepared and support freedom by buying from infowarstore.com.
[31:00.520 --> 31:05.880]  Before I started working at InfoWars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and InfoWars.com
[31:05.880 --> 31:10.520]  but also the products at InfoWarsstore.com and there's one product that's offered at
[31:10.520 --> 31:15.880]  InfoWarsstore.com that is the elite of the supplements and that's DNA Force Plus.
[31:15.880 --> 31:19.880]  Now I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests,
[31:19.880 --> 31:23.680]  Telomere's and Telomere's support with your DNA.
[31:23.680 --> 31:28.560]  So I started to look into the science and what Telomere's were and how it can improve
[31:28.560 --> 31:32.080]  your health and longevity when you protect your Telomere's.
[31:32.080 --> 31:35.520]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus but it's expensive.
[31:35.520 --> 31:36.520]  Why?
[31:36.520 --> 31:40.880]  Because it is an elite supplement and then I started seeing other competitors coming
[31:40.880 --> 31:45.920]  up with competitive supplements for Telomere's support and they came and they went.
[31:45.920 --> 31:48.920]  But DNA Force Plus is still there.
[31:48.920 --> 31:50.400]  It is the elite supplement.
[31:50.400 --> 31:55.200]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive so you should
[31:55.200 --> 32:00.080]  take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at InfoWarsstore.com.

[33:03.560 --> 33:11.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:11.720 --> 33:21.720]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[33:21.720 --> 33:26.840]  The last Democrat president, let's look into Obama the way they've looked at me.
[33:26.840 --> 33:31.440]  From day one, they've looked into everything that we've done.
[33:31.440 --> 33:34.960]  They could look into the book deal that President Obama made.
[33:34.960 --> 33:36.760]  Let's subpoena all of his records.
[33:36.760 --> 33:42.200]  Let's subpoena all of the records having to do with Hillary Clinton and all of the nonsense
[33:42.200 --> 33:46.240]  that went on with Clinton and her foundation and everything else.
[33:46.240 --> 33:47.520]  We could do that all day long.
[33:47.520 --> 33:50.960]  Frankly, the Republicans were gentlemen and women.
[33:50.960 --> 33:57.080]  When we had the majority in the House, they didn't do subpoenas all day long.
[33:57.080 --> 33:59.360]  They didn't do what these people have done.
[33:59.360 --> 34:11.560]  What they're doing is a disgrace, so destructive to our country, and I think that's why.
[34:11.560 --> 34:17.520]  So full-page ads in the New York Times that cost $150,000 a piece, paid for by George
[34:17.520 --> 34:28.560]  Soros' son, and now they're running new ads calling for fire bombings of ICE facilities
[34:28.560 --> 34:32.120]  and they're coming with an army to attack.
[34:32.120 --> 34:33.840]  I'm going to get more into that.
[34:33.840 --> 34:39.560]  The articles are up on infowars.com.
[34:39.560 --> 34:44.880]  But notice, we were all told that today we were going to see the declassification of
[34:44.880 --> 34:48.760]  all the memos on Russiagate and all the Comey crap.
[34:48.760 --> 34:54.760]  And I said last week, I said, you watch, Bill Barr is going to block that because he's there
[34:54.760 --> 34:58.440]  to cover their butts.
[34:58.440 --> 35:01.440]  He's there to try to get them to stop coming after Trump so they can make a deal.
[35:01.440 --> 35:05.080]  But the Democrats aren't holding up their end of the bargain, are they?
[35:05.080 --> 35:09.000]  To kiss and make up and play patty cakes.
[35:09.000 --> 35:12.720]  And so now a federal judge had said today, even a bar didn't release it, that the federal
[35:12.720 --> 35:18.160]  judge was, oh, and now the federal judge has backed it off another month.
[35:18.160 --> 35:28.440]  Epiagents went to Comey's home we learned to retrieve secret memo after his termination.
[35:28.440 --> 35:34.880]  So there's been a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes that we're all just learning about.
[35:34.880 --> 35:42.720]  We're going to get to all of that and the huge China developments, the economy developments,
[35:42.720 --> 35:51.320]  the debates last night, several guests coming up and so much more today.
[35:51.320 --> 36:00.080]  But first, I want to raise this point of the New York Times, Dr. McCamshaw, please.
[36:00.080 --> 36:05.400]  I want to raise this point.
[36:05.400 --> 36:08.560]  How much does it cost?
[36:08.560 --> 36:15.840]  The New York Times says on average a full-page ad is $150,000.
[36:15.840 --> 36:20.720]  Now that could be just on average, but in the front section, it's more.
[36:20.720 --> 36:24.360]  Now they ran a lot of these ads, not just in the New York Times.
[36:24.360 --> 36:29.920]  Now this is paid for by George Soros' son, the main funder of Refused Fascism, whose
[36:29.920 --> 36:34.200]  leader runs it nationwide and has gone on just this last month.
[36:34.200 --> 36:39.200]  The Young Turds program, the Young Turks, and said the violent overthrow is coming.
[36:39.200 --> 36:44.400]  So has basically everybody.
[36:44.400 --> 36:45.400]  You've heard the Democrats.
[36:45.400 --> 36:46.400]  We need a violent revolution.
[36:46.400 --> 36:52.120]  Any means necessary, Joe Biden said physical revolution.
[36:52.120 --> 36:53.920]  So that's where they're going.
[36:53.920 --> 36:58.640]  And the reason that's important is $150,000 for that ad.
[36:58.640 --> 37:05.320]  See, I'm trying to raise $300,000, $400,000, and to do that, I've got to sell a million
[37:05.320 --> 37:11.920]  dollars worth of product because you are used to getting the products at 30%, 40%, 50% off.
[37:11.920 --> 37:18.360]  So now, if I don't have sales all the time, we don't sell the product.
[37:18.360 --> 37:20.120]  And then we make 20% or so.
[37:20.120 --> 37:24.160]  Some of these deals are so good, we make less.
[37:24.160 --> 37:25.160]  And I'm not complaining.
[37:25.160 --> 37:31.160]  The fact that then we sell a million dollars worth of product over two or three days, we've
[37:31.160 --> 37:33.680]  sold, what are we up to, like $600,000.
[37:33.680 --> 37:38.160]  Can we go to infowars.com for us last show, guys, and look at the counter there, look
[37:38.160 --> 37:47.280]  at the gas gauge on this attempt to fuel up the operation, yeah, $700,000, which is wonderful.
[37:47.280 --> 37:55.080]  But then you realize that's probably $150,000 of, quote, profit to try to have extra money,
[37:55.080 --> 37:59.920]  to a little bit of extra money, to launch some new shows, and to have some other initiatives
[37:59.920 --> 38:04.600]  that obviously with our platforming, I'm not going to tell you some of the well-known successful
[38:04.600 --> 38:10.680]  groups and organizations that are able to expand and in the face of all this censorship, despite
[38:10.680 --> 38:14.320]  the fact that they've all been demonetized and they've all been basically shut down,
[38:14.320 --> 38:21.080]  that we've been able to go out and get other people to begin to set up some systems of
[38:21.080 --> 38:26.400]  capital so that they can continue to operate or expand.
[38:26.400 --> 38:31.240]  And I see that really as my responsibility is not just to make infowars bigger and stronger,
[38:31.240 --> 38:36.440]  but to go out and really empower others that have shown that they can do a great job.
[38:36.440 --> 38:43.240]  And so about half of what we do is public, but there's a lot of other stuff you don't
[38:43.240 --> 38:44.240]  know about.
[38:44.240 --> 38:54.840]  I've been really frustrated in that I've not been able, the last year, to put $5 million
[38:54.840 --> 38:56.560]  into other people's projects.
[38:56.560 --> 39:03.160]  I've only been able to put half a million dollars in other people's projects.
[39:03.160 --> 39:08.920]  And we've got the sweetest, juiciest projects that I know are just going to be dynamite
[39:08.920 --> 39:15.640]  in the information war that, quite frankly, I need like $5 million because used to I'd
[39:15.640 --> 39:20.120]  have an extra couple million dollars and I would go out some years $5 million and I'd
[39:20.120 --> 39:21.480]  spend it.
[39:21.480 --> 39:25.680]  I would give it to basically almost every prominent name you know, usually off record,
[39:25.680 --> 39:31.760]  but other little fledgling groups, organizations, plane tickets, hotels, RVs, insurance, security,
[39:31.760 --> 39:37.640]  websites, books, films, and we've been good stewards with your money.
[39:37.640 --> 39:44.040]  And look, I've got a nice house and I've got a nice car, but I've got the $60,000 truck
[39:44.040 --> 39:45.040]  or whatever.
[39:45.040 --> 39:47.080]  I don't need the million dollar Lamborghini.
[39:47.080 --> 39:49.640]  I care about defeating the globalist.
[39:49.640 --> 39:55.440]  And so I see money as fuel or as ammunition and I've got enemy soldiers coming at us and
[39:55.440 --> 40:01.320]  literally you're like a stork that flies over and drops provisions in on us here so we can
[40:01.320 --> 40:06.800]  keep fighting or dropping in a new machine gun barrel for us if you want to use a military
[40:06.800 --> 40:08.840]  analogy or drop medicine in for us.
[40:08.840 --> 40:13.000]  It's like video games where you know you're about to die and you get another life and
[40:13.000 --> 40:20.200]  used to let's take a Gallagher analogy, a great 1980s video game where you're a spaceship.
[40:20.200 --> 40:22.120]  And you know, sometimes I was really good at when I was a kid.
[40:22.120 --> 40:27.120]  I'd get up to like five spaceships and I'd get to where I got so good I'd basically almost
[40:27.120 --> 40:28.120]  beat the game a few times.
[40:28.120 --> 40:29.120]  I would just quit.
[40:29.120 --> 40:30.120]  I never had time.
[40:30.120 --> 40:34.960]  I was never a huge video game guy, but on a few things like that, I think I did win
[40:34.960 --> 40:36.960]  Gallagher once or something.
[40:36.960 --> 40:42.040]  The point is, is that a time I was like 11 or 12, I'm like why am I playing Donkey Kong
[40:42.040 --> 40:43.040]  three hours a day?
[40:43.040 --> 40:44.040]  I'm gonna stop this too.
[40:44.040 --> 40:52.200]  But see, I'm down to, I'm down to one ship basically.
[40:52.200 --> 40:59.440]  And if they blow up this ship, then all the other little ships out there that we've helped
[40:59.440 --> 41:04.080]  spawn and support and push, you know, some of those people that we helped build up and
[41:04.080 --> 41:11.040]  promote and push, they won't even help me or even talk to me now.
[41:11.040 --> 41:12.400]  That's okay.
[41:12.400 --> 41:16.360]  They are doing good work, even if they're doing it for their own selfish purposes, or
[41:16.360 --> 41:21.320]  if they're missing the gene that tries to build up other people and other things.
[41:21.320 --> 41:24.560]  Or they're just scared because they don't want to be associated with me because the
[41:24.560 --> 41:27.040]  establishment comes after you if you are.
[41:27.040 --> 41:28.640]  They're just not leaders.
[41:28.640 --> 41:33.320]  They've still done great jobs.
[41:33.320 --> 41:36.800]  You know, every time James O'Keeffe comes on, he gets about 100 phone calls threatening
[41:36.800 --> 41:39.440]  him not to ever come on here again and they have national news stories.
[41:39.440 --> 41:44.480]  Well, that makes James O'Keeffe come on because he's a leader.
[41:44.480 --> 41:49.480]  Matt Drudge just talked about, or you've seen it in the news, where media matters tells
[41:49.480 --> 41:50.480]  him not to link to somebody.
[41:50.480 --> 41:52.400]  He just starts linking to them more.
[41:52.400 --> 41:53.400]  But that's called leadership.
[41:53.400 --> 41:57.320]  And by the way, that's not an ass-kissing exercise I engaged in.
[41:57.320 --> 42:03.880]  You have to highlight things that are effective and that are truthful and that are manly.
[42:03.880 --> 42:09.600]  Because there's plenty of men out there who are green berets and Navy SEALs and all this
[42:09.600 --> 42:14.800]  other stuff, but they won't politically the minute you've got heat even talk to you.
[42:14.800 --> 42:18.960]  Oh, before you're under attack, they want to be your buddy and they're all about their
[42:18.960 --> 42:21.640]  own personal monetary success.
[42:21.640 --> 42:23.400]  Not all of them, but a lot of them.
[42:23.400 --> 42:27.120]  But then you'll just get average Americans and other people that understand that when
[42:27.120 --> 42:30.680]  something's under attack, that means it's really important and it's special and needs
[42:30.680 --> 42:31.680]  to be defended.
[42:31.680 --> 42:39.120]  And so we've got store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points, and 50-60% off everything
[42:39.120 --> 42:41.960]  right there and your funding funds this operation.
[42:41.960 --> 42:43.520]  We have a lot of extra sales right now.
[42:43.520 --> 42:49.120]  You can also make straight donations to M4WarsHore.com or M4Wars.com for its last show.
[42:49.120 --> 42:52.320]  Just go make a $100 donation, a $50 donation, and there's all these wealthy people that's
[42:52.320 --> 42:56.040]  sitting on their hands, and then it's the little widows and people that are financing
[42:56.040 --> 42:57.040]  us.
[42:57.040 --> 42:59.960]  It shouldn't be the widows, it should be the men of this country.
[42:59.960 --> 43:03.920]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[43:03.920 --> 43:08.280]  The other thing that's unique about M4Wars is it isn't the only network of this reach
[43:08.280 --> 43:12.120]  that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed
[43:12.120 --> 43:15.760]  by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[43:15.760 --> 43:17.480]  It is completely independent of all that.
[43:17.480 --> 43:23.200]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[43:23.200 --> 43:27.040]  and freedom of speech, that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of
[43:27.040 --> 43:31.400]  the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[43:31.400 --> 43:34.960]  because this was the kind of press they wanted, and then ultimately we now live in an era
[43:34.960 --> 43:38.800]  where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies
[43:38.800 --> 43:42.920]  who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views the person's allowed to
[43:42.920 --> 43:46.960]  have or express or hear, and the M4Wars audience has broken through that.
[43:46.960 --> 43:51.800]  The, they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy
[43:51.800 --> 43:55.720]  and freedom, and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the blackwarming
[43:55.720 --> 43:58.960]  defamation, lawfare, and libel targeting youth.
[44:00.960 --> 44:05.160]  M4Wars, the most banned network in the world.
[44:05.160 --> 44:09.840]  Yours and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, and we're under unprecedented
[44:09.840 --> 44:14.080]  evil attacks as you've seen, but I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom
[44:14.080 --> 44:18.120]  of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against
[44:18.120 --> 44:22.000]  us last week, the worst things you can say about people, that you knew they were liars,
[44:22.000 --> 44:25.720]  you went and looked it up and found out the truth, and so I feel very strong, and I feel
[44:25.720 --> 44:29.280]  God's hand on my shoulder, and I feel your love in my heart, and I want you to know that
[44:29.280 --> 44:33.080]  love is right back at you, and I want to thank you for all you've done with your word of
[44:33.080 --> 44:36.720]  mouth and your prayers and your financial support, because I'm committed to fight to
[44:36.720 --> 44:41.440]  the end, but I want to win, and without you, I'm going to be destroyed, and it's not going
[44:41.440 --> 44:46.080]  to be fun, but that's not what's important. The enemy could win. We're a key chess piece
[44:46.080 --> 44:50.320]  in this fight. We're being used by God. You're being used by God. This is providence, so
[44:50.320 --> 44:54.160]  I salute you, and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.
[44:54.160 --> 45:01.560]  M4Wars, the most banned network in the world.
[45:01.560 --> 45:05.560]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're
[45:05.560 --> 45:09.200]  going to kind of reboot all our supplements, in that if you go back five, six years ago
[45:09.200 --> 45:12.720]  before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits, the rest of it, I would talk about
[45:12.720 --> 45:16.400]  how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were, and I'd have doctors
[45:16.400 --> 45:19.800]  on and experts to explain why they were so good. And instead, the last few years, I'm
[45:19.800 --> 45:23.040]  like, hey, we need to really support us, or they'll shut us down. The biggest thing people
[45:23.040 --> 45:25.760]  like to buy is supplements, because they know how great they are and how wonderful they
[45:25.760 --> 45:27.880]  were. And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[45:27.880 --> 45:33.000]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements. No, under federal
[45:33.000 --> 45:38.480]  law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have
[45:38.480 --> 45:42.080]  no jurisdiction and won't look at it. But then they say you've got to say it's not approved
[45:42.080 --> 45:46.560]  by them. And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate
[45:46.560 --> 45:50.040]  it and do different things. And a lot of drugs work great. They have side effects, not with
[45:50.040 --> 45:56.080]  Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest. InfowarsStore.com
[45:56.080 --> 46:14.040]  or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine, last night, I'm on infowars.com.
[46:14.040 --> 46:18.040]  And I read Chris Pratt criticized for t shirt choice. It is literally the shirt that I envisioned.
[46:18.040 --> 46:22.640]  A Betsy Ross, but also another just classic American flag all 50 stars with the Gadsden
[46:22.640 --> 46:26.240]  T under the flag. They don't travel the American flag. It's a perfect combo. So great minds
[46:26.240 --> 46:29.200]  think alike. I mean, whoever designed that shirt, we'd already come up with the exact
[46:29.200 --> 46:34.640]  same similar design. It is the don't tread on me American flag t shirt inspired by the
[46:34.640 --> 46:39.840]  triggering of leftist of the shirt worn by Chris Pratt. But it's a battle tattered flag
[46:39.840 --> 46:43.920]  like the one that flew over Fort Sumter. And again, on the back, it says America's back
[46:43.920 --> 46:51.000]  infowars.com 4,000 of these babies. And that's it. So we've got the Betsy Ross version and
[46:51.000 --> 46:56.480]  the American flag version at infowars.com. You have printed in the USA right now infowars.com.
[46:56.480 --> 47:02.960]  We'll be right back. The most banned broadcast in the world.
[47:02.960 --> 47:30.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:30.960 --> 48:00.920]  He said CNN credentials or just regular press credentials.
[48:00.920 --> 48:07.920]  Money talks. You guys know that. Sure. CNN's paper. There's a whole footprint.
[48:07.920 --> 48:12.920]  Where does the public space start, sir? At the next block?
[48:12.920 --> 48:17.360]  At the next block and go down. And did you see that? There's a gate. You guys are right
[48:17.360 --> 48:23.040]  there. There's a green gate over there. And if you get inside there, that'll be a miracle.
[48:23.040 --> 48:28.040]  Okay. Well, thank you, sir. All right.
[48:28.040 --> 48:32.040]  A lot of people said you did good during the debate side. Do you feel glad?
[48:32.040 --> 48:36.200]  Yeah, I feel really glad, especially after the last debate. I feel like I didn't get
[48:36.200 --> 48:39.880]  a chance to lay out my vision for the economy of the country. I feel like I did this time.
[48:39.880 --> 48:44.880]  So it's great. What do you think about? No, no. What do you think about? I just want
[48:44.880 --> 48:51.080]  one question. Just one question. Just one question. Okay. Why do you think that we need
[48:51.080 --> 48:56.960]  to have a news ombudsman in America? We're just about to enter the era of deep fakes,
[48:56.960 --> 49:00.240]  but we're not going to be able to make heads or tails of the stuff we're seeing online.
[49:00.240 --> 49:03.960]  And we know the Russians have already been hacking us. It's going to get worse, but literally
[49:03.960 --> 49:08.920]  you could have a picture of me saying words, you know, a video, and it could be something
[49:08.920 --> 49:12.720]  that gets doctored. So we need to start having countermeasures in place. That's what I believe
[49:12.720 --> 49:14.720]  in. Do you think it's really good to be policing
[49:14.720 --> 49:18.120]  the press, though, and speech? I'm sorry. We've got to go, guys. Do you think it's
[49:18.120 --> 49:22.000]  good to be policing free speech? Thank you. Thank you, guys. So good to see you. Yang,
[49:22.000 --> 49:27.040]  is it really a good idea to be policing the press? Thank you. The goal is to protect the
[49:27.040 --> 49:32.200]  American people. But isn't it, you know, we, you guys are supposed to protect our rights,
[49:32.200 --> 49:37.720]  right? As America, she keeps following Millie waiver, uh, Andrew Yang, who's a real authoritarian
[49:37.720 --> 49:43.760]  dart bag really knows how to manipulate people telling us, Oh, we need a government special
[49:43.760 --> 49:48.360]  office that controls what can be seen and heard. That's called a national censor. Communist
[49:48.360 --> 49:54.800]  China and North Korea have those. Russia had those. Oh, because of deep fakes. Oh, you
[49:54.800 --> 50:00.000]  mean like the media saying that Trump called black people rats? That's not a deep fake.
[50:00.000 --> 50:04.880]  That's just a total lie. He said, stop saying the board patrol does a terrible job and is
[50:04.880 --> 50:10.920]  killing kids. It's very nice conditions for the women and children. Your city's falling
[50:10.920 --> 50:18.600]  apart. It's infested with drugs and rats. That's what you say that that area is infested
[50:18.600 --> 50:24.440]  with crime. And it turns out there's video of Elijah Cummins saying that and Bernie
[50:24.440 --> 50:30.360]  tenders and but see, it doesn't matter because it's all about fraud. And so we'll have a
[50:30.360 --> 50:38.480]  special office run by Andrew Yang that tells us, I know he's not from China, but he really
[50:38.480 --> 50:43.520]  should go there. They'd probably bring him into the Politburo. Maybe he could be dictator
[50:43.520 --> 50:50.560]  after he steps down someday. So it's just incredible. Here's what I'm gonna do. I had
[50:50.560 --> 50:54.720]  a very interesting guest. I've seen some of his videos online about natural law. I think
[50:54.720 --> 50:58.480]  Mark Passio coming on, but I decided to move into next week. I apologize. Is that forgotten
[50:58.480 --> 51:03.360]  that I'm gonna be on a work occasion tomorrow, taking care of some new projects so that that
[51:03.360 --> 51:06.680]  kind of scrambled up what we're gonna do. But so he'll be on next week. I still have
[51:06.680 --> 51:12.320]  a guest on who has been over in Hong Kong these demonstrations. And he also heads up
[51:12.320 --> 51:17.360]  the National Prayer Group. And he's coming on at what time is that at one o'clock central
[51:17.360 --> 51:23.440]  Joey Gibson. He's part Japanese. So he speaks a lot of the language over there and has been
[51:23.440 --> 51:27.520]  in Hong Kong. And has just gotten back up for several weeks. There is going to give
[51:27.520 --> 51:31.680]  us a frontline report. He took part in many of the demonstrations that are for the citizens
[51:31.680 --> 51:37.040]  not being secretly arrested and disappeared to mainline China. And it looks like China
[51:37.040 --> 51:42.960]  is going to officially invade Hong Kong. And Trump just blinked, which I don't see how
[51:42.960 --> 51:46.880]  he couldn't because Hong Kong's pretty much been part of China. Taiwan's a different kettle
[51:46.880 --> 51:51.920]  of fish. But the Chinese military built a big giant bridge into there, one of the biggest
[51:51.920 --> 51:56.440]  in the world. They're massing troops. And I just don't think there's anyone we can do
[51:56.440 --> 52:04.080]  if they invade Hong Kong. It's going to be a blood bath. And it can easily kick off into
[52:04.080 --> 52:08.600]  something much, much bigger that will make Tiananmen Square that killed thousands look
[52:08.600 --> 52:16.600]  like just to walk in the park. So this whole thing is deteriorating very, very, very quickly.
[52:16.600 --> 52:23.400]  There are a lot of smuggled weapons in Hong Kong. And again, the folks in Hong Kong are
[52:23.400 --> 52:27.960]  again historically very businesslike, very professional, very smart. But once wars kick
[52:27.960 --> 52:32.040]  off over there, it's never pretty. Let's just say people don't hesitate to start killing
[52:32.040 --> 52:39.640]  each other. So this is not a game. It's very, very dangerous. And I mean, we had to kill
[52:39.640 --> 52:45.640]  something like a million Chinese in the Korean War, a million of them. They just kept coming.
[52:45.640 --> 52:53.440]  And MacArthur said, drop atomic weapons on them and old ding dong chickened out. We wouldn't
[52:53.440 --> 52:56.560]  even have the Chai comms in charge today if it wasn't for Harry S. Truman, who helped
[52:56.560 --> 53:01.960]  the CIA put China and the Communist in charge. And then a few years later, we're fighting
[53:01.960 --> 53:08.160]  them in Korea. Simply amazing, ladies and gentlemen. I don't want to use nuclear weapons,
[53:08.160 --> 53:13.200]  but at the same time, it would have been nice to never have the Chai comms, right? You know,
[53:13.200 --> 53:22.040]  MacArthur thought about a coup and the military wanted to have a coup and remove the Democrats.
[53:22.040 --> 53:26.880]  And MacArthur said, no, we'll, we'll beat the communists down the road. And he recruited
[53:26.880 --> 53:33.200]  people like Richard Nixon and others to his cause. But it was a day late, a dollar short.
[53:33.200 --> 53:38.320]  Because if he would have removed Harry Truman, who was a traitor, sign us over the UN, the
[53:38.320 --> 53:42.280]  Russians, you name it, we would not be in this position today. Now, who knows what would
[53:42.280 --> 53:45.880]  have happened? History would have been totally different. I just, you're looking back on
[53:45.880 --> 53:51.840]  hindsight, siding with the Communist Chinese, giving them the military's coordinates, letting
[53:51.840 --> 53:56.280]  them overrun our troops, because the UN was giving all the information to them. It's just
[53:56.280 --> 54:02.600]  treason. And I'm sick of sitting here propping up Communist China. So now, 60 something years
[54:02.600 --> 54:10.840]  later, China's got the Panama Canal. Our infrastructure, our debt, 98% of the rare earth's minerals
[54:10.840 --> 54:18.360]  and they're just taking over the planet and are set to invade Hong Kong. And they sell
[54:18.360 --> 54:23.960]  political distance organs. They have millions in death camps. They torture nonviolent Buddhists
[54:23.960 --> 54:31.520]  to death. They torture Christians to death. I'm sick of it. But here we are, ladies and
[54:31.520 --> 54:40.160]  gentlemen, all these years later dealing with this. And now they're set to invade Taiwan.
[54:40.160 --> 54:44.040]  And you know, I understand that we just probably at this point can't go to war if China takes
[54:44.040 --> 54:48.720]  over Hong Kong, because it did used to be part of China. But the legitimate government
[54:48.720 --> 54:54.680]  ran to Taiwan. If they try to take Taiwan, all hell's going to break loose. A large part
[54:54.680 --> 54:58.640]  of the population will resist even if the government goes along and this government's
[54:58.640 --> 55:05.800]  not going along. Trump's shipping all those weapons in there. So he's not blinking on
[55:05.800 --> 55:11.600]  that front. It looks like we're going to make our stand here in the South China Sea Islands
[55:11.600 --> 55:19.480]  and the Spratlys to the north and looks like we're going to make our stand here at Taiwan
[55:19.480 --> 55:24.640]  for the next big war. But it's going to kick off. It could kick off. We could be in a full
[55:24.640 --> 55:28.960]  scale war with China as early as tomorrow, next week. Now I'm not saying that's going
[55:28.960 --> 55:34.560]  to happen, but all the money is on this being where the next big war starts. If not Pakistan
[55:34.560 --> 55:38.800]  and India that have already been attacking each other this year. And then you got Israel
[55:38.800 --> 55:44.600]  is already in a war, a proxy war with Hezbollah in Syria. This is a very interesting time.
[55:44.600 --> 55:51.120]  So that's coming up next hour. And I'm going to play clips from the big debate. And then
[55:51.120 --> 55:57.440]  I haven't gotten into the biggest news here. I'm sorry, tuning on horn. It's true. I specifically
[55:57.440 --> 56:04.920]  said Jeffrey Epstein was engaged in rituals 10 years ago at his island. You can go pull
[56:04.920 --> 56:11.000]  those articles up and then he was carrying out transhumanism and that always part of
[56:11.000 --> 56:17.160]  the Satanism is this transhumanism. Well, Jeffrey Epstein hoped to seed human race with
[56:17.160 --> 56:24.160]  his DNA and had a race study facility built in New Mexico. Now that's even the New York
[56:24.160 --> 56:27.800]  Times, but it goes deeper than that. They're acting like, Oh, he was saying this at all
[56:27.800 --> 56:32.040]  these dinners and meetings. No, that's all they talk about these dinners and meetings.
[56:32.040 --> 56:37.600]  It is their religion. So I'm going to show you where 11 years ago with the video, I broke
[56:37.600 --> 56:45.040]  all this down. And it's not because I'm a seer like the actual review said that Jones
[56:45.040 --> 56:51.480]  isn't a seer. He just was lucky on Epstein and everything else basically. No, I'm not
[56:51.480 --> 56:58.560]  a seer. I'm a studier. A seer has to look through the ether and magically know what's
[56:58.560 --> 57:03.080]  going on. I can study the enemy and study the globalist and then I can figure out what
[57:03.080 --> 57:09.200]  their next moves are and it does seem like I'm seeing. And then I guess when you do shoot
[57:09.200 --> 57:14.360]  bulls out 800 yards of scope, I mean, a little bit becomes like almost a seeing thing, but
[57:14.360 --> 57:18.080]  it's not that it's just skill and training. It's the same thing with something like this
[57:18.080 --> 57:22.520]  or it's something with being a master golfer or anything. It's studying history and the
[57:22.520 --> 57:27.800]  pathological behavior of the globalist and the algorithms that our electrochemical brains
[57:27.800 --> 57:34.240]  come up with. But the real reason we're here is because you saw, you believed in this broadcast
[57:34.240 --> 57:38.640]  and you supported it. You sensed history was happening and you are a giant part of it.

[58:50.880 --> 58:54.680]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become? Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies
[58:54.680 --> 58:58.680]  and the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social, economic, political
[58:58.680 --> 59:02.400]  or legal for their illicit activities over two decades. And because of that, that's why
[59:02.400 --> 59:06.400]  the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about
[59:06.400 --> 59:09.480]  this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this have to
[59:09.480 --> 59:13.680]  bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct, otherwise they
[59:13.680 --> 59:17.280]  will never change and they will become the Big Tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the
[59:17.280 --> 59:21.560]  big trust of the 19th century who ran American politics and ran American economy almost into
[59:21.560 --> 59:25.320]  the ground until we were able to recover after the Great Depression. The info war's audience
[59:25.320 --> 59:30.800]  is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world to make real the actions
[59:30.800 --> 59:35.280]  of independent free speech, to make real the original promise of an independent free press.
[59:35.280 --> 59:39.800]  Real collusion is Big Tech and Big Media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle
[59:39.800 --> 59:43.560]  with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts. And then the whopper of telling us the whole
[59:43.560 --> 59:47.440]  time it's not happening. It's the ultimate form of gaslighting. What you just saw isn't
[59:47.440 --> 59:53.960]  what you just saw. Even it is what we just saw.
[59:53.960 --> 01:00:15.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. If you are receiving this transmission, you
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:34.440]  are the resistance. If you agree with me, go to Joe 30330 and help me in this fight.
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:44.440]  You wanna hear that again? You wanna see that again? If you agree with me, go to Joe 30330
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:49.680]  and help me in this fight. Let's cue that back up one more time and play it in a second.
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:53.520]  You know, it was a couple months ago that Facebook said they're banning using my name
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:58.840]  or info wars.com in a positive way. If you wanna be disparaging, have at him. But he
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:04.840]  doesn't have a way to respond and he's presiding on grata, the Chinese social credit score,
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:13.160]  but have at him all you want free for all. Think about that. And I read the articles
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:17.840]  of why they banned me. They said, well, the last straw was his disinformation that has
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:23.320]  Biden had a second stroke. And I played where he said the top of his head got chopped off
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:27.520]  and he talked about how he almost died and the doctor said he'd probably never be normal
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:31.200]  again and he appears to have neurological problems. I said, has he had a second stroke?
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:37.160]  Because every speech he can barely talk, he has like a bunch of marbles in his mouth from
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:42.480]  just a year ago. I mean, he sounds like he's gonna be in a nursing home. I mean, my grandmother
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:49.360]  talked better than him when she was 92 and then she died. They said, oh, you, he's the
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:55.320]  presumptive leader. You can't point out the obvious. Now it's all over the news. He's
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:59.120]  got cognitive problems. He's got neurological problems. Doctors weigh in on what may be
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:04.560]  slurring speech. Maybe it's that stroke he had and that brain surgery and those embolisms.
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:11.400]  Exactly what I told you. And again, it's like looking up at the night sky and saying, what
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:15.000]  color is it? Well, it's black and it's blue and it's red and it's yellow, but mainly it's
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:22.200]  black. Or what color is the sun? It's yellow. Or what color is grass? It's green. I'm not
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:29.280]  doing anything fancy pants here. But see, I'm calling them out when the president says,
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:31.800]  you know, Elijah Cummings, you shouldn't have said the board of patrols doing a horrible
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.320]  job. You're the Democrats that blocked the funding and you're the ones telling everybody
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:38.920]  to come up here and get free stuff. And then you sit there and say that we're doing all
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:42.120]  these bad things. The kids, when we're not, you want to clean up your district. It's the
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:46.440]  highest crime rate in the country per capita. You've got rats and there's documentaries
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:50.840]  about it. And it's like, you just called me a rat. I'm like, no, I just said, you got
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:54.640]  a rat problem. You just call the black man a rat. You're like, no, I didn't get. Yeah,
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:03:05.320]  you did. Yeah, you did. And then it becomes this whole obsession and it goes on and on
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:15.760]  and on and on and on. And then you get video of Elijah Cummings saying that it's drug infested.
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:21.000]  And then you get clips of every other politician saying, including the mayor, but none of that
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.760]  matters because to the people attacking Trump, it's not about logic. It's the power structure
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:30.480]  that wants power. And then it's the idiots that think they're part of the power structure
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:36.160]  because they support it when they're the ones getting screwed over by it. But that's why
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:41.200]  they're called losers. Why they're called schmucks. It's very, very sad that you can't
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:48.240]  un-schmuck a schmuck. You can't seem to get fools and dumbasses and idiots to ever stop
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:53.200]  getting scammed because they're low IQ and they're stupid and they come in every color
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:59.120]  white and black and brown and pink. Well, I know dumbasses every stripe man. And I can't
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:03.960]  stand the type of people that drive 15 miles out of the speed limit in the fast lane when
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:08.400]  the road's open to the type of people that when they go into a turn lane and underpass
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:13.960]  and there's an open lane and it's got a white line all the way out. They still stop. And
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:18.120]  I've actually followed one of the people before into a McDonald's. They turned into the same
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:24.400]  gas station. I said, Hey, you know, back there a mile, you don't have to stop. They went,
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:28.840]  huh? What do you speak English? He goes, Yeah, who are you? And I said, and I'm just like,
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:34.760]  never mind. You just don't understand, do you? Because you're dumb and you're dangerous
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:43.480]  because you will, you will vote me into a freaking FEMA camp. I'll be there carrying your garbage
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:48.440]  out while you sit above me with a machine gun. That's what I left once our guns man.
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:52.640]  They want to make us their slaves. So damn bad. Like all these inner city people, they've
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:59.160]  got a slaves and they know it and Trump wants to stop it and they hate him for that.
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:06.280]  Serving with info wars is a great honor. But I still need my morning coffee. And luckily,

[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:25.080]  what we're going to do my friends coming up at the bottom of the hour. I'm going to open
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:28.880]  the phones up, but I'm only going to take 10 phone calls so I get to all of you. And
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:31.520]  then when we're done with those 10, we'll open the phones up again, just the only way
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:35.560]  to not have you settle them cold for an hour. So we're going to open the phones up pretty
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:39.200]  much right now. I'll give the number out. But at the bottom of the hour, we'll take
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:45.280]  your calls on any subject you want to discuss the debates last night. China basically already
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:51.320]  invading Hong Kong already sitting in plain clothes paramilitary massing troops. White
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:55.760]  House says looks like they're going to invade completely Trump says go soft on it. I just
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:01.960]  don't think we can do anything. We've got a bridge linking to it now it's not like Taiwan.
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:06.680]  This is this is going to be a mesh expansionist China wound up by the globalist given all
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:12.040]  our industry given all our jobs sold out. But turn on CNN we hear about how Trump's
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:18.880]  a globalist excuse me a agent of the of the Ruskies when it's the globalist are the ones
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:25.440]  telling us take down our American flags. America was never great and never be that great.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:28.760]  So we're going to open the phones up. We can also talk about the big article up on info
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:34.600]  wars dot com anti for publicly organizing terror attacks on ice facilities in Texas.
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:40.120]  The official national group funded by Alexander Soros officially says they're going to lay
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:46.680]  siege to border facilities ice facilities and they show graphics of how to fire bomb
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:53.280]  and kill people with images of pools of blood and dead ice officers. So I'd like to get
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:57.760]  your take on that specifically if your police are military or been in the border patrol
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:01.640]  or ice. What are you thinking about this. You just got fire bombed a few weeks ago and
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:10.560]  they said the guy was a hero eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine eight
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:12.480]  seven seven seven eight nine Alex eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:16.840]  I promise we're only take 10 calls at times you don't have to hold that long. That's coming
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:23.480]  up eight seven seven seven eight nine Alex. But in the meantime I want to hit two big
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:31.560]  things here and obviously during the calls we'll mix in a lot of other news and clips
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:36.200]  New York area fire commissioners make history say that there were clearly bombs in the buildings.
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:40.600]  Now they said that back then but these are people with degrees in engineering and in
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:45.120]  fire control and it doesn't mean there isn't radical Islam doesn't mean that Saudi Arabia
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:50.240]  wasn't involved. It's what I keep saying it means that there were people inside the government
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:55.240]  working with it in a larger plan just like they did the Arab Spring. I'm going to hit
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:09:04.560]  that because this press conference happened seven days ago and it's still gotten no coverage
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:10.120]  other than info wars.com and some local New York news and then of course this because
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:14.720]  if you understand this you understand everything Jeffrey Epstein hoped to seed human race with
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:21.920]  his DNA and you pretty much got to read the whole article because if you know what we
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:30.680]  know or you've seen in game blueprint for global enslavements free online you understand
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:39.200]  what he was really doing. He built a cold springs harbor facility with a medical wing
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:51.160]  everything in New Mexico to study life extension and studying genetic clones. Now this is all
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:55.400]  going to come out but right now they're like oh you have all these top scientists in but
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:10:03.560]  they weren't involved and he was all just making this stuff up. Uh huh right. Sure. Believe
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:09.160]  me folks they're taking hardcore drugs they're getting all sorts of blood transfusions and
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:14.500]  they need all this medical stuff and kids that these birth mothers have like Rosemary's
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:19.280]  baby they get used for all this stuff. Remember I told you about the Hollywood cults that
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:24.000]  were branding people and starving women to death because they want them skinny and pathetic
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.600]  that was three years ago I told you. Huffington Post came out and attacked me and said how
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:33.240]  dare Jones say Harvey Weinstein is connected to groups that brand women and get them incredibly
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:36.920]  skinny. They're like why would they want to do that. They want to see beautiful women
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:42.840]  freaked out, anorexic, hating themselves. It's the seeing them emaciated. It's a vampiric
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:53.960]  event. It's a demonic vampire spirit. You go oh that's mumbo jumbo. No it's all interdimensional
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:11:00.840]  folks. It's all interdimensional feeding. The next best thing to torturing a child to
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:07.040]  death is screwing one up. The next best thing to that than killing a woman is if you can
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:14.720]  starve them, destroy their self-confidence and then feed off them and use them as slaves.
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:19.880]  The more beautiful the woman, the more you want to degrade them. It's the pimp life.
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:23.600]  Remember that famous HBO show about pimps? His daughter's been run over, the daughter's
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:28.720]  been run over and the mother's there going my baby, my baby she's hurt. And the daughter's
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:32.520]  saying the pimp has been put the cigarettes out on her. Baby I'm gonna get back on the
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:37.360]  street for you. I'm gonna get you that money. That's right bitch. You don't give me that
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:40.280]  money. The mother's like you don't even pay my daughter anything. She goes no I don't
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:44.400]  give her anything. She pays me the money. She's lucky if I get her a bucket of chicken
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:55.320]  once a week. You think pimps invented that? That's nothing. It's all about using people.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:59.520]  That's what Democrats do. They pimp their constituents. They don't want you successful.
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:06.280]  They don't want you empowered. They want you run over, dominated, controlled. So exactly
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:10.160]  what I told you they're doing is what is in the news because I've talked to people that
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:22.800]  have been involved. I've studied their writings. I know what they're doing. And until people
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:29.160]  start to realize this, you're going to be used by them. And it's so sad how their followers
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.960]  believe that they're actually part of the winning team. But if you actually go study
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:39.920]  Antifa or Democrats, even low level ones that are making $10 an hour from George Soros,
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:45.440]  they have the pimp attitude and can't wait till they graduate up to be controlling and
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:49.600]  running people. And they know it's a fraud. They know it's all a scam. They know it's
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:53.960]  a criminal endeavor. They just want to take over Austin and kill people and move into
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:13:00.920]  their houses. They're just dreaming of some Soviet grandeur like the Jacob and French
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:05.240]  Revolution. That's all they're doing. But the first thing I want to do when we come
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:09.040]  back is I want to get to some of these debate clips because they're really, really powerful
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:13.880]  to watch them eat their own. I like to be on here, but I got to tell you two nights
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:18.360]  in a row, I had to leave. I mean, actually an hour and a half in, I got up and said,
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.920]  sorry, folks, I can't look at them anymore. I went home and listened to the show and
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:27.880]  everybody did a great job, but I can't look at them. But I got to say Tulsi Gabbard, who
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:32.920]  keeps winning the debates online, who they keep trying to hide from everybody. She says
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:38.800]  a lot of really good things that challenge the fraud of the SJW Democrats. I still wouldn't
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:43.440]  want to elect her. She's still not pro-gun, but I think she's a genuine person who really
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:47.280]  believes what she's saying and it's why she doesn't look soulless. Every time she was
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:53.200]  up there, I could look at her not just because she's pretty, but I didn't feel sick inside.
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:59.240]  But almost everyone else up there made me want to jump out of a window. That's because
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:07.720]  deep down, you know, these aren't real people. Camilla Harris, give me a break. And you know,
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:11.880]  Joe Biden's bad news, horrible guy, but he at least had some humanity back when he had
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:22.240]  energy. He can't keep his hands off anybody. But look, he's just a doddering person now.
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:26.440]  So what are they going to do? And then the only real people that were up on the stage,
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:32.840]  oh, they want both Mary Ann and Tulsi out of there. And of course, Mary Ann is a complete,
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:41.800]  and a loon in many respects. But still, they don't want her there either because she keeps
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:46.360]  being number two in the polls because they're changing the subject. You think they want somebody
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:51.320]  up there saying your water is full of poison? The rich elites want to hurt you because you're
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:56.800]  black? Well, and she said because you're poor. It's actually true. They put hydrofluorosalistic
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:03.680]  acid in the water to lower your fertility and your IQ. Now, the average person doesn't
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:10.120]  know that. But people like Joe Biden do. But Joe Biden just went along for the power. He's
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:15.680]  just a smarty pants lawyer from from Maine. In fact, I know folks that knowing people
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:19.680]  that have vacation with his family, people that live next door, people that sold him
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:24.120]  the property that they're bars on. I mean, I know multiple people that have known JoJo
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:34.320]  since he was a teenager. And they just say mean, arrogant, saucy, follow himself. But
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:40.700]  is he as bad as a new generation of globalist? No. But he's not going to make it to the finish
[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:44.640]  line. Like Trump said, he thinks he's still the leader of the democratic field. But if
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:49.720]  he can make it, I mean, that light bulbs dimming by the minute, it kind of goes out for a minute,
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:52.440]  kind of comes back in when the light bulb is going out, gets real bright for a minute,
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:58.000]  kind of gets dark. I mean, it's about to go to be gone.

[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:03.320]  George Arwell said that in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:08.000]  act and so used to it wasn't that important to wear the American flag because we still
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.560]  loved our country and there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it. But
[01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:16.880]  now they're trying to take it out of schools. They're taking it down off of government buildings.
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:20.640]  Weird white leftist that won a virtue singular pulling down American flags and running up
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:25.840]  Mexican flags. This is the bizarreness of the America hating we're seeing. So now it is
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:30.440]  a revolutionary act in a time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying to wear
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:35.520]  the American flag particularly the Betsy Ross anti-slavery flag and particularly when
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:41.200]  it says on the back right there ladies and gentlemen America's back in pull wars.com.
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:46.440]  So whatever you do take action today and exercise your free speech in these bullies face all
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:50.360]  over not just the U.S. but worldwide because more than ever the American flag is a symbol
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:58.200]  of freedom against globalism.
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:04.000]  The globalist are hyper competitive scientific dictators they are technocrats they are control
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.880]  freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your own life and make
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:13.280]  your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods. Now we're
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:17.600]  fighting them hard in cyberspace we're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:21.640]  One of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:26.480]  in our lives is our bodies. If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:32.440]  fourslife.com I couldn't do it. That's why we decided to take our original secret 12
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:38.040]  that was incredibly high quality. And double the strength of it in a new formula ultra
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:44.080]  12 ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest highest quality B 12 over the counter that you're
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:49.040]  going to find anywhere. It is amazing experience pure medical bottom and B 12 for yourself
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:55.760]  and fund the second American Revolution against the tyrants at info wars store.com in fourslife.com
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:20:02.760]  or triple eight two five three three one three nine. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:32.760]  So an international terrorist organization with hundreds of millions of dollars of funding
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:42.400]  that's already firebombed ice facilities and wounded hundreds of Americans with knives
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:50.520]  and clubs and hammers pro bars is organizing nationwide terrorist operations and then
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:56.440]  they intend to march on Texas and November 1st begin firebombing ice facilities. They're
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:21:02.000]  funded by Alexander Soros publicly. Last hour I provided all the documents all the proof
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:08.040]  all their internal memorandum what police departments they're working with and ladies
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:15.040]  and gentlemen I don't even think they'll get arrested not even in Texas because they work
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:22.040]  for the deep state and Trump hasn't even gotten control of the government yet. He's starting
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:27.400]  to and that's why they're so scared. So I've got headlines like this MSNBC Trump wants
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:34.400]  to exterminate black people. That clip's coming up next segment. Max boot big neocod says
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:39.800]  when the US becomes a majority minority the Trump era will be seen as the last gasp of
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:44.120]  white resistance he goes on to say whites are inherently bad people and lazy and stupid
[01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:50.840]  and so does his other neocon Trotskyite. William Crystal it's all in the article. These are
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:56.440]  the neocons as if being whites bad or wanting guns or wanting free market or not hating
[01:21:56.440 --> 01:22:01.400]  your country but they they're telling minorities you hate America you're for burning American
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:06.800]  flags and it's the Republican and Democratic establishment they're the ones pushing racism
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:13.800]  it's unbelievable. Speaking of that Tulsi Gabbard torched Camilla on criminal justice
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:21.760]  will play the clip she's like you're calling Joe Biden racist. You were the prosecutor
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:28.560]  an attorney general that would throw the book and get black people three times the sentences
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:35.560]  and then it gets worse. It gets worse because she also supported the Clinton crime bill.
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:45.960]  So oh by the way family's ultra wealthy from guess what Jamaica mom. Oh but there's never
[01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:53.920]  brown people on slaves. Okay that's a good one right there. Better thinking in but that's
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:23:00.920]  the history that I want you to know ladies and gentlemen. Okay let's go ahead and play
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:09.680]  Tulsi Gabbard. Senator Harris says she's proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she'll
[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:14.680]  be a prosecutor president but I'm deeply concerned about this record. There are too many examples
[01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:19.480]  to cite but she put over 1500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed
[01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:26.480]  about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana. She blocked evidence that would
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:32.360]  have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so. She
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:36.800]  kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as chief labor for the state of
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:43.480]  California and she fought to keep cash bail system in place that impacts poor people in
[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:47.960]  the worst kind of way. Thank you Congresswoman. Senator Harris your response. I can't listen
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:52.120]  to what she says. I'm proud of being a prosecutor. I am tough. I just can't listen to what you
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:59.120]  already heard at once. I'm not going to do it. Now continuing. I was watching Juan Williams
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:04.680]  just yesterday morning and he's making the rounds not just on his own show but all over
[01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:09.320]  the other shows. He's like Trump's racist and Trump called black people rats and the
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:14.280]  other hosts were like no he didn't and then Juan Williams is like yeah well what's he
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:20.120]  done? Well criminal justice reform. He's trying to decriminalize marijuana more than Obama
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:24.800]  did. He goes well I'll give him that but he called black people rats. You want somebody
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:30.200]  to get your ass out of jail and clean up the rats and then oh he's calling me a rat and
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:35.120]  by the way I should have made a bigger deal about this because we first covered this.
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:39.520]  I mean we were the first to cover this like a month ago and then the president took notice
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:46.600]  of it and I never covered it again. ASAP Rocky was the footage in Sweden that we covered
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:51.800]  a month ago. Remember this? Where you've got these three rappers and their big bodyguard
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:55.800]  looks like he weighs 300 pounds and there's these two little Islamic dudes following them,
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:25:01.560]  pushing them in their face. There's 30 minutes of footage. We played like 10 minutes of it.
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:07.560]  Finally they start trying to slap and push. I'm talking 140 pound punks, a 300 pound black
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:15.440]  dude and so oh yeah they also hit him. They also grabbed his headphones out of his pocket
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:24.000]  and slapped him across his face so hard that the bodyguard was bleeding. Well Rocky at
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:30.640]  that point gets pissed because hey his licensed bodyguard knows I don't want to go to jail
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:36.000]  so I don't want to fight. So this guy's letting these people slap him in the face like bitches
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:46.640]  do and hit him over the head with the earphones, headphones and so ASAP Rocky grabs them, slams
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:51.920]  them to the ground, punches them a few times which I would have done and leaves. I remember
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:55.600]  hearing that they had been arrested. The listener's back then didn't believe me because I don't
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:26:02.120]  know who ASAP Rocky is. I know he's popular, I know he likes Trump and there's video of
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:07.560]  all this where they're hitting the bodyguard but here's the deal, they're Muslims. This
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:13.720]  is a Swedish no-go zone. Paul Watson's like 6'4". Okay some other crew are big guys.
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:19.260]  They went to Belgium to a no-go zone and they needed gas for the car too. They were driving
[01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:26.440]  all the town everywhere Muslims said get out of here and started chasing their car. It
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:32.080]  was robbing mobs of people because they were white. But see it's not just if you're white,
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:37.840]  if you aren't their Islamic group and they're like a nice area where he was playing in nice
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:45.040]  shops and this goes on for 30 minutes. The raw footage is up on infowars.com and they
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:51.240]  finally are acknowledging these no-go zones. It's incredible books and he's facing two
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:57.760]  years in prison even though it's admitted that these guys hit them first but see they're
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:07.440]  not charging the big bodyguard because he let them beat him. It's when ASAP Rocky gets
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:12.560]  pissed and starts kicking their ass because this is going on, there's 30 minutes of it.
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:19.120]  They say it went on for an hour as they follow him around because that's what little wimps
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:25.080]  do and see they knew the state is behind me because in Sweden the Swedes are nice people
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:31.880]  and tough too. The Romans had trouble conquering them but now they're so domesticated that
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:36.400]  they're vikings folks. They're so domesticated that men will just sit there while their kids
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:41.640]  get beaten and as long as this will beat their wife and kids to death and then the father
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:45.480]  watches while they throw them in the lake and the father just sits there and they pee
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:51.480]  on themselves because the programming, I'm not kidding there was one article where the
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:59.640]  father sat and urinated on himself just because their whole culture in Europe is just worshipping
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:06.760]  oh oh you're a Muslim oh oh oh oh please don't be bowing. All of a sudden here's the rappers
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:12.480]  walking down the street people start following like little roosters come up pecking at them
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:16.120]  and finally after all the slapping his bodyguard grabbing his headphones hitting him in the
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:22.520]  head it's all on video they finally beat their ass let's play that part. I mean I wouldn't
[01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:27.200]  put up with any of that and I'd be in jail you grab my headphones slap them across my
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:33.680]  head I'm gonna knock your teeth out and I'm gonna go to jail because in Sweden the state
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:37.480]  the state lets people go that rape five-year-old girls they say well in Islam you're allowed
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:42.160]  to so they follow them into stores messed with them followed them out of the stores messed
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:47.040]  with them he goes on for 30-something minutes they fight back and that's the ultimate crime
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:52.200]  is fighting back anyone that's Antifa or Islamic or part of the army of the New World Order
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:59.480]  they are God they are your ruler bow to them now. Hi I'm Dan Pilla I started fighting the

[01:30:58.120 --> 01:31:03.000]  pilot yes i got a plug for the patriot point second oh thank you got 180 dollars so far this
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.160]  year and i feel like i'm stealing from you i buy so much in the store because i mean i
[01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:09.720]  don't want to get that money to walmart i don't want to give that money to people who are going to
[01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:13.560]  donate it to causes i don't believe in so i'd rather give that money to you and i'm getting
[01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:18.280]  quality products the products that i do receive have changed my life i mean the x2 has really
[01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:23.320]  done a lot for me i've lost weight my brain works a whole lot better my kid they use the toothpaste
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:27.880]  my son used to get these little sore throats and he puts x2 in water and drinks it and it gets rid
[01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:32.120]  of his sore throat uh he'll start let me break this down for you i want high quality stuff in there
[01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:36.680]  i want a good price but i've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:40.280]  percent off i'm making two dollars on the toothpaste 50 percent off and so it's the same
[01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:44.760]  thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth thank you so much for the plugs but listen
[01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:49.240]  when people get the patriot points a lot of times it makes things a loss leader because if you're
[01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:53.800]  already getting 10 off because you're on autoship then we're doing 50 off and then you do something
[01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:57.800]  like that uh we have patriot points we lose money but that's okay thanks for the support
[01:31:57.800 --> 01:32:03.480]  before i started working at info wars i was not only a fan of alex jones and info wars dot com
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:08.280]  but also the products at info wars store dot com and there's one product that's offered at info
[01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:13.640]  wars store dot com that is the elite of the supplements and that's dna force plus now i
[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:18.360]  remember when alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests telomeres
[01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:23.080]  and telomere support with your dna and so i started to look into the science and what
[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:29.160]  telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your
[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:34.360]  telomere so i started looking into dna force plus but it's expensive why because it is
[01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:39.640]  an elite supplement and then i started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:46.360]  supplements for telomere support and they came and they went but dna force plus is still there
[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:51.240]  it is the elite supplement i get excited when dna force plus is on sale because i know it's
[01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:57.720]  expensive so you should take advantage of 50 off dna force plus at info wars store dot com
[01:32:57.720 --> 01:33:07.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:26.280]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:31.080]  okay during the break a national well-known journalist i'll just leave it that sent me a
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:38.840]  message i looked it up it's incredible i'm catching my breath right now i won't be ready to cover this
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:43.000]  till the start of the next segment and that's not a cliffhanger that's not me putting a hook
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:49.400]  out there to make you stay tuned i am hyperventilating right now wow this is
[01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:54.520]  over the top i should probably take this call this is from the white house
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:58.840]  let's just say stop stop is definitely getting crazy right now
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:08.360]  we need to push joey gibson back 15 minutes i really want him on he just got back from hong kong
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:15.880]  again he's uh part of his family's from asia so he's knows the the the lay of the land and
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:21.400]  he of course heads up the patriot prayer group it's an expert on antiphos he's a perfect guest for
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:26.280]  today but i need to push him back so we have time to get the calls and so i have time to hit this
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:34.200]  next subject next segment because it's all coming together right now in fact i almost covered this
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:39.000]  sunday but i decided not to do it because i knew where it was going next and i have a prediction
[01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:47.080]  i have a prediction i was sure of it sunday but i just didn't want to sound like i was stirring up
[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:56.040]  trouble i've always got to go my god man they're going to list antiphosa terror group
[01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:02.120]  and they're going to list q as one as well like they already did
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:05.160]  and then they're going to connect you to me
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:13.560]  god push people listen to me man nobody does i can't believe this i'm getting a headache right now
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:19.480]  oh i hate being right man
[01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:25.560]  they're going to stage stuff and q is the perfect cut out
[01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:30.120]  because they can have their operatives do it and then blame it on the movement
[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:34.840]  anything anonymous like that is made to set people up that's why i'm out in the open and
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:40.920]  what i stand for is clear there's all these people that want to play along like they're part of a
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:48.040]  fortune cookie or easter egg hunt or something and it's it's like that pokemon game where you go
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:53.880]  around with the phone find the pokemons it's just like please man the whole world's going on in front
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:58.520]  of everybody and i think i've pretty much figured out the stuff works by this point
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:03.480]  i'm not judging you have been part of the q thing i'm not saying you're bad
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:09.400]  but holy to leto you know my name you know who i am you know what i stand for you know i'm under
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:16.040]  attack you know trump tweets out in full wars sarah sanders has said they're not one with q
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:27.000]  no it's fun to say q q q q q see okay i'm gonna get to it you know i'm not going to say what
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.520]  the news is until the start of the next hour because i need to take your calls like i said i
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:37.320]  do and i need to just settle down a little bit not get angry but man i saw this this weekend
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:41.960]  and i had all the clips ready and i'm going to make the prediction you can ask the producers in there
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:47.080]  because i was saying to myself they're going to have antifungal attacks
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:51.480]  but how are they going to counterbalance that and make it look like there's a violent republican
[01:36:51.480 --> 01:37:00.120]  opposition and just sure as dead people push daisies i sat out on my back porch for an hour
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:07.240]  drinking iced tea watching my daughter playing her little baby pool swimming pool a little rubber
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:17.400]  plastic pool and a light bulb went boom q q q q q q then i just sat here sunday right
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:24.040]  from on there and i said no i'm not going to do that because people have already been brainwashed
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:30.280]  by it and they'll think i'm calling them an idiot and maybe i'm wrong but i'm not
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:40.040]  oh boy oh they're gonna oh it's horrible see i opened the show with antifungal planning
[01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:43.480]  terror attacks november first they say they're gonna start the terror attacks the terror attacks
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:50.360]  have already begun but they're going to stage death and blame it on q and the new york times
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:57.080]  when that schizophrenic went and killed the head of the gambino crime family had nothing to do
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:03.800]  with the democrats if you want to really get down to brass tacks dumbasses the new york mafia
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:09.400]  probably supports trump a lot more than anything anyways the new york times and a bunch of others
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:15.400]  think the gambino crime family is so stupid that they try to act like i sent this guy to kill him
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:21.160]  when you know who we think will probably be the type of person to put a bullet in me what does my
[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:29.560]  security think the damn q people because they're the perfect cut out of morons okay i'm gonna stop
[01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:37.800]  right now i'm getting mad right now i'm gonna settle down right now i'm mad at myself right now
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:43.080]  i should have gumbled this sunday i have a rule that i always go with my gut and i when i was young

[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:09.400]  now where we are having uh double patriot points 50 to 60 off store-wide and of course
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:16.440]  store-wide free shipping and you know we sold a lot of water filters yesterday and that's great
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:23.000]  we actually had a bigger day yesterday than the day before because of them talking about poison
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:31.480]  in the water supply and i'm like yeah we have the two highest rated brands alexa pure and pro pure
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:34.840]  are apples and oranges one's better at this one's better at that but hundreds and hundreds of
[01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:40.360]  chemicals they completely cut out thousands of chemicals they reduced to near undetectable
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:44.840]  levels there's some spectrometers that could still find some you know zero point tenth of a
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:49.880]  billion of something so you can't say there's none of it in it but whether you're on well water or
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:57.320]  whether you're on aquifer water whatever it is radioactive isotopes bacteria fluoride you need
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:03.080]  these and all of our systems from the shower heads to you name it are whatever the best is on the
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:07.640]  market you can get there's always some weird Rolls Royce brand that's a little better that
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:13.880]  costs 10 times more okay but i'm a prosumer type person that i just go out and research what i would
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:17.320]  buy what's the best for the price and i get it whether it's the storeable food whether it's
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:21.080]  water filtration whether it's self filtration that's all massively discounted right now as well
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:27.080]  stop the clowns do you know how these distributors sell me air filters and water filters
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:32.040]  that cost during these specials only happens about twice a year because they can do such a bigger
[01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:36.520]  order when they manufacture guaranteeing that i'm going to buy thousands of these that it saves
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:40.360]  some money that that's how they do it and then there are other distributors don't want to negotiate
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:44.360]  stuff i guess they're not capitalist and other people get past why does ali sell them so low
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:49.160]  you gotta stop him yeah yeah we got the best on my patreon we got the best the water filters
[01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:57.000]  you're gonna find period because i'm a super capitalistic right-wing flame-throwing texan okay

[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:14.680]  that's not backed by some billionaire that's not being funded by a secret foreign government it is
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:20.760]  completely independent of all that it is an old school american 1776 style experiment in the expression
[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:25.400]  of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the
[01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:30.120]  beginning of the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:33.800]  because this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:38.200]  they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:43.560]  control and manipulate what news it views the persons allowed to have or express or hear and the
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:49.240]  info wars audience has broken through that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:53.880]  ultimate american democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:46:01.480]  blackwarming defamation lawfare and libel targeting youth as we witness the most disastrous geological
[01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:08.120]  activity in recorded history the globalists are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:14.920]  for civil war borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged the world is
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:21.800]  going to change and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:28.600]  when the system fails the system is vulnerable electricity could be gone in an instant and
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:35.960]  grocery stores could be empty in three days having storable foods and the ability to purify water

[01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:28.920]  of our locked up inmates are illegal gang members this place is going down if anybody who can hear
[01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:34.040]  my voice is not prepared you better be i'm not i'm like you i'm not calling for violence or anything
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:40.920]  else but i'm telling you get out into the country get away from the crowds and you better be able
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:45.480]  to defend yourself because if they're putting this in newspapers they're not playing we've already
[01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:51.400]  seen what they'll do and we better be prepared is all i'm trying to say well that's right you're
[01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:55.480]  not going to have the ford foundation the carney endowment or the rockefeller foundation or the
[01:50:55.480 --> 01:51:00.520]  soros open societies group themselves do it they're just going to run full page ads the new york
[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:05.160]  times saying overthrow the government starting in november and now another november comes by and
[01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:11.320]  on their official site uh they're literally saying we're going to liberate and storm and and the
[01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:18.840]  what's the terms they use we're going to have a militancy training tour where we lay siege to
[01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:24.280]  ice facilities and they show ice officers in pools of blood burning vehicles and the american flag
[01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:31.000]  on fire that is 2019 and they just fire bombed a facility three weeks ago that's my whole point i
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:37.560]  have friends who are ice officers i know people down on the border that do that job they go to work
[01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:41.800]  and they kiss their wiles like they may not come home that day it's the most dangerous job in law
[01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:47.720]  enforcement this is america we should not have to worry about this my family worried for me whenever
[01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:51.240]  i leave what you're saying is it's a two front war you got to go out your front door and not
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:57.160]  never get hit by a car stabbed or run over or catch some disease now typhus the la pd is getting that
[01:51:57.160 --> 01:52:03.720]  and then you've got to be thought of as an enemy i love my state i love my country i love my people
[01:52:03.720 --> 01:52:11.960]  we need to stand up for what is important political correctness is over this was what got us to this
[01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:17.320]  point i'm tired of being nice but unfortunately with my job i have to tow a line and that's why
[01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:21.960]  we've got to get leadership in that gets we have to be be politically incorrect on purpose but all
[01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:26.840]  of us together and we start pushing back see we don't want to control people's lives or tell other
[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:30.840]  people how to do this or that that's why i go to city council and get in their face i go to state
[01:52:30.840 --> 01:52:35.320]  reps and get in their face i go to the congress and get right in google's face and facebook's face
[01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:39.400]  and twitter's face and you know i don't want to do they think i want to march into congress and start
[01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:44.840]  yelling at people but you know what we have to do it god bless you it's come down to that they've
[01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:49.320]  been bullying us long enough we didn't start this so we're not the bullies you know it's all over
[01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:55.080]  the news oh alex is a bully oh you know he i'm not the bully i'm the person standing up the bullies
[01:52:55.080 --> 01:52:59.560]  you're absolutely right though thank you sir shannon in texas go ahead thanks for holding
[01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:07.080]  her on the air mr jones how you doing sir good my friend good hey listen i i real quick before i
[01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:11.160]  get to my point i wanted to say you know the way the best way to drain this swamp is to move
[01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:16.360]  the united states capitol out of washington dc there is nothing that says that it has to be there
[01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:20.840]  the trump would move it to start moving department by department to rule texas rule
[01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:25.400]  oklahoma rule state those people are gonna come here they don't want well he can certainly move
[01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:30.280]  the agency's buildings out of there but there is acts of congress and law on the district of columbia
[01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:35.160]  yep but a lot of these work we're not they're not even constitutional department
[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:41.880]  well that's an even better idea is just to abolish them yeah exactly or send the administration
[01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:49.080]  to the senate the administration of the states exactly uh i was going to say that uh you know
[01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:55.400]  obama called for a civilian army it was going to be well funded you know and a lot of this
[01:53:55.400 --> 01:54:00.200]  stimulus money that he spent it didn't go to infrastructure like he said it was going to you
[01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:05.800]  know he went to different groups and different things to fund uh what i think is you know a lot
[01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:10.280]  of this antifa and that's you know we know soros gets a lot of his money from it you know buff
[01:54:10.280 --> 01:54:16.600]  it got a lot of the money it's just they're they're using this money and i think they got
[01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:20.280]  a bigger plan than what we even realized oh they did god bless you i appreciate your call
[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:24.440]  joe is in texas a lot of calls in texas because antifa says you just joined us the articles on
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:28.280]  info wars dot com with links right to the big national site that can buy a hundred and fifty
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:33.240]  thousand dollar ads the new york times they're saying they're going to lay siege to federal
[01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:38.840]  installations last time the south did that we had a civil war i mean this is a big deal
[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:44.200]  and joe points out antifa promoted on tv shows netflix yeah i barely watch entertainment
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:48.840]  but i scan what's in the entertainment news so i see the trailers they've got cbs shows
[01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:53.880]  about punch a trump supporter uh they've got shows about antifa being heroes everywhere
[01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:58.600]  and so again hollywood doesn't want to do the killing themselves they're trying to get useful
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:05.240]  idiot morons to go out and do it for them joe what are you seeing on netflix and tv shows
[01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:10.440]  hey alec yeah there's this really popular still on netflix right now i think if you just log
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:14.920]  into netflix they have all the super popular suggestions and stuff and there's this spanish
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:19.880]  show that's uh taken everybody by storm now called money heist which is basically about a
[01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:25.640]  bunch of globalists and socialists who are robbing the spanish government and uh in this latest
[01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:31.960]  new season they put up they are robbing the uh spanish gold vaults in the spanish central bank
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:37.720]  and they get the giant crowd of their protesters to come and create a distraction and then they
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:42.840]  they cut show a scene of that where they literally have the antifa flag so these are the good guys
[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:47.880]  they're getting their buddies let me just stop you i haven't seen this show but what's the name of it
[01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:53.480]  again money heist money heist because because you understand i know you know this facebook
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:58.520]  and google were set up to cause mass riots and overthrow governments the weaponized test was
[01:55:58.520 --> 01:56:04.120]  the europe spring so that's mainstream news they're now using this area 51 thing as a data test
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:09.320]  to go oh facebook lets you can get 1.8 million people now that are going to attack this installation
[01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:13.720]  and of course nothing will end up happening with that probably but this is just to get everyone
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:18.520]  trained and everyone ready to understand kind of what the game plan is but that's it they plan
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:25.000]  to do an arab spring and al gore called for with his llamasist involved hezbollah ms 13 the democrats
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:29.880]  and they're trying to have all these shows so the average leftist watches this and believes they can
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:36.440]  carry it out themselves yeah exactly and it's just it's also hilariously ironic that spain is one of
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:43.080]  the most socialist uh governments in the west and in the world and that their their tv programs are
[01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:49.080]  saying oh we got to go rob all the bank but don't you guys already have like 25 percent uh free
[01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:56.360]  salary and all that jazz yeah spain has a communist president yeah spain has a a a a first
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:57:00.600]  communist president ever and they had the spanish civil war with that he is a communist
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:07.240]  trump wouldn't talk to him balasaro wouldn't talk to him and and yeah exactly oh but they think the
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:11.000]  average spanish person is so dumb in spain that they're watching this when they have a communist
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:18.840]  government that won't let catalonia leave and it's but oh the socialists are fighting the
[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:27.000]  socialist in the show god bless you great points yeah anytime any show i watch on netflix it's white
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:31.080]  people are the devil communism's good i mean i can't even watch tv anymore it's just nothing but
[01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:36.600]  propaganda and i can't watch any movie with robert deniro the little five foot tall tough guy because
[01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:42.040]  you know he's a piece of crap you can't go watch that new scorsese movie i'm sure it'll be good but
[01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:49.160]  still it's all good because these people are scum david night here you can join me every monday

[01:58:37.320 --> 01:58:45.560]  on info wars dot com forward slash david dash night dash show
[01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:51.160]  let's talk to marcus in new york marcus here on the air thanks for holding hey
[01:58:51.160 --> 01:58:55.640]  oh yeah i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here
[01:58:55.640 --> 01:59:00.440]  out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars
[01:59:00.440 --> 01:59:05.160]  i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that
[01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:09.960]  that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020
[01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:13.880]  that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i
[01:59:13.880 --> 01:59:17.720]  think he could be defeated other than assassinating him it's the time to be praying my friend i agree
[01:59:17.720 --> 01:59:21.800]  entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but
[01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:26.600]  the reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old i would
[01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:30.920]  love to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down no you've gone
[01:59:30.920 --> 01:59:36.200]  into this war you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many
[01:59:36.200 --> 01:59:40.520]  others who are going to continue we're going to keep fighting in the info war and even if something
[01:59:40.520 --> 01:59:45.560]  does happen to you or your show know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for

[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:12.280]  to happen happen like watching big thunderstorms across the lake and then they come across to the
[02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:17.400]  rain you're standing on your backyard and you know right as it comes 100 yards 50 yards 20 yards

[02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:33.640]  right now let's go ahead and go to uh mike in fema region 10
[02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:39.960]  wants to talk about this whole situation with antifa publicly organizing with soros funding to
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:48.760]  carry out terror attacks against ice facilities november 1st hey alex uh i'm a 30-year veteran
[02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:55.080]  united states army i act and reserve i held a t.s f.c.i clearance i was badged to go into
[02:01:55.080 --> 02:01:58.840]  shayan mountain if you know where that is in colorado i do that's the whole for the real shadow
[02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:04.600]  government uh well there's a lot of good patriotic no i understand no it's the c o g the real shadow
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:09.560]  government for nuclear attack not the fake globalist shadow government well let me explain i was in
[02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:15.880]  uh bunkerville in 2014 as a person with that clearance i was on the ground boots on the ground
[02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:20.600]  i had a reason to be there uh there's probably a reason the other side didn't shoot us because it
[02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:26.360]  would have been a very embarrassing uh episode for the obama administration to have a commissioned
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:33.000]  officer with that clearance shot and killed on the scene so yeah that hold on i may even hold
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:37.480]  you over and need because i need to get to this and a guest but explain what's happening the
[02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:42.280]  specific event you're talking about well i'm gonna i'm gonna be down and i know you got joey
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:48.040]  gibson holding i'm gonna be down uh in portland on august 17th it's time for veterans to stand up
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:53.720]  who is supporting defend the constitution but one thing that you need to understand the schools
[02:02:53.720 --> 02:02:57.400]  don't teach the constitution so when you go in the military and you raise your right hand you
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:01.640]  swear your oath to the constitution if you don't know what's in the constitution how do you have
[02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:08.680]  an oath to it in 1928 there was a training manual november of 28th that taught citizenship to every
[02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:14.120]  person in the military uh you can look it up yourself there was an executive order in the
[02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:19.880]  department of defense right now or president trump assigned to teach constitutional law to every
[02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:24.280]  person in the military right needs to be done you're saying you were there at the whole bundy
[02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:29.640]  situation i knew they had active duty military that obama was trying to use against them that only
[02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:35.160]  happened i guess to a certain extent yeah i ran into david night i was boots on the ground i was
[02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:39.560]  standing right in front of the stage when uh clive and bundy uh was talking i saw the whole thing
[02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:46.920]  and uh and part of it was because i wanted to know who was in our government and who was
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:52.680]  going to take away my clearance just for being there as an american citizen okay it never happened
[02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:59.160]  although people in the intelligence community would do a little i guess uh jokes insinuations
[02:03:59.160 --> 02:04:03.480]  that they knew that i was there but nobody ever said anything i i ended up retiring i served
[02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:08.520]  uh from uh carter through the president administration that's how many administrations i
[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:16.600]  served on wow uh so uh i just thought you know i heard you a little bit upset and you know down
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:21.400]  no there are a lot of patriots out there and i tell you well i know there is but the way they
[02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:26.120]  know how to set us up and the way we're walking into these traps and just how nasty they are and
[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:30.600]  the fact that they're not easy to beat really really obsessed with me but but but god bless
[02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:36.600]  anything else you want to add mike yeah you always say it when you're in christ you're free
[02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:41.880]  you got nothing to lose right when you're free on my deathbed i'll look my kids in the eye and say
[02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:47.320]  i fought i did not sit down and i stood up and you're gonna do the same thing and i want the
[02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:51.960]  rest of the veterans to stand up and do the same thing it's time to save the republic call back
[02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:59.720]  again mike beautiful call barbara barrens what does big tech become a big tech are big babies
[02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:03.800]  that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because they face no consequence social
[02:05:03.800 --> 02:05:08.120]  economic political or legal for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that
[02:05:08.120 --> 02:05:12.200]  that's why the courts the judges the juries the members of the independent free press that care
[02:05:12.200 --> 02:05:15.880]  about this the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this has to bring
[02:05:15.880 --> 02:05:20.280]  real social political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never
[02:05:20.280 --> 02:05:24.760]  change and they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century
[02:05:24.760 --> 02:05:29.080]  who ran american politics and ran american economy almost into the ground until we were able to
[02:05:29.080 --> 02:05:33.880]  recover after the great depression the informers audience is the fuel that flames the the light
[02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:39.000]  of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:43.320]  the original promise of an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media
[02:05:43.320 --> 02:05:47.640]  manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's
[02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:51.320]  thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate
[02:05:51.320 --> 02:05:55.800]  form of gaslighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what you just saw
[02:06:01.880 --> 02:06:13.800]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:24.280]  okay i'm gonna break this down as simply and succinctly as i can and this is really a public
[02:06:24.280 --> 02:06:31.720]  service announcement and it's it's what the facts show there's a lot of facets to psychological
[02:06:31.720 --> 02:06:40.520]  warfare and to brainwashing people and if you look at one area and liken it to that it would be
[02:06:40.520 --> 02:06:46.760]  the nigerian phone scam or the nigerian email scam and i have had three members of my extended
[02:06:46.760 --> 02:06:54.200]  family fall prey to the nigerian scams and when you when they fall prey to them and get robbed
[02:06:56.280 --> 02:06:59.800]  they will never admit they were robbed or scammed to the person that warned them
[02:07:01.240 --> 02:07:04.680]  and that's how the nigerians will first get one payment and then they'll trick you
[02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:09.800]  to give it other payment and you don't want to admit that you've already put it a bunch of payments
[02:07:11.160 --> 02:07:15.960]  so you put in more and more it's how gambling works and i'm not a gambler that just gambles
[02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:20.840]  for money i gamble for freedom but how it works with the dopamine is when you go in
[02:07:22.280 --> 02:07:26.280]  and you make an investment and you put the money in the slot machine or you put the money on the
[02:07:26.280 --> 02:07:30.440]  crap table and you don't get it back you think well i don't want to lose that i better get back in
[02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:36.040]  again now four chan and eight chan have a lot of great memes a lot of great things there's a lot
[02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:40.920]  of great people on there but it's a lot of anonymous people who can go on there and put any
[02:07:40.920 --> 02:07:46.840]  disinfo they want and the big no no unfortunate is ever questioning four chan or eight chan or
[02:07:46.840 --> 02:07:52.200]  or that somebody could be set up on there you just don't do that just alex jones bad they know they
[02:07:52.200 --> 02:07:57.480]  can't get orange man so orange man good but so much of what orange man does is bad you understand
[02:07:57.480 --> 02:08:03.640]  how that works and again i'm not saying everyone on four chan or eight chan is bad i'm saying
[02:08:03.640 --> 02:08:08.440]  bad people can go on there and they can run scams like anybody could but but something set up to
[02:08:08.440 --> 02:08:15.240]  be anonymous like the dark web of anything is going to have dangers and so i watched this q
[02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:19.800]  phenomenon start a few years ago and i watched coursey getting a big fight with him after he'd
[02:08:19.800 --> 02:08:27.000]  been so enamored with it and i just said listen i don't like anything that's secret okay because
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:32.760]  if it's a public movement someone can do something in my name i said they have a right to exist to
[02:08:32.760 --> 02:08:37.000]  do whatever they want as long as it's not violent a lot of good people are going to believe in it
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:41.160]  they're going to get involved in it but it's just like anonymous people used to ask me are you for
[02:08:41.160 --> 02:08:48.840]  anonymous and i'd say well anonymous to be anybody wearing a guy fox mask doing a video show some
[02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:54.040]  stuff people do in that name i agree with some stuff's bad you know the globalists have been caught
[02:08:54.040 --> 02:09:00.520]  setting up things the name of anonymous so along comes the q movement that i've now learned was
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:05.400]  the answer to info wars we're a populist pro america out in the open movement that isn't a cult
[02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:09.400]  we don't have meetings i just promote ideas and things and people listen and check them out
[02:09:10.920 --> 02:09:15.640]  let's see if you have q it can put out the breadcrumbs it can say what's going on it can
[02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:20.440]  show you this show you that and then oh you have a relationship with the president and you've got all
[02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:25.560]  these people believing they have a relationship with the president including sheriff's deputies and
[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:31.320]  all these people that show it with mike pence wearing q things on their badges and then
[02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:37.240]  mike pence sees it and takes the twitter down and then obviously mentally ill person who tries to
[02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:41.960]  do citizens arrest goes and believes federal marshals are going to release him when he goes to
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:46.760]  citizen arrest the head of the gambino crime family they reportedly get an argument or whatever
[02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:51.160]  happened and then they have that guy dies and then i'm reading of the new york times that q part of
[02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:57.960]  alex jones's movement went and killed him i had nothing to do with that and so it's it's a perfect
[02:09:57.960 --> 02:10:03.080]  way to set people up so this weekend i was reviewing the gambino thing that happened a few weeks
[02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:06.760]  ago and i was reviewing sarah sanders saying we're not for any group that calls for violence
[02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:11.960]  and i was just thinking about man antifa is getting ready to launch more terror attacks
[02:10:11.960 --> 02:10:21.640]  how are they going to operate how are they going to launch these attacks that have the media cover
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:27.000]  it up but then act like it's part of a civil war they're going to need some type of right wing group
[02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:32.040]  that they can cut out and blame but because libertarians and christians and conservatives
[02:10:32.040 --> 02:10:35.080]  know not to be offensively violent because we're law abiding and because we understand they're
[02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:41.080]  trying to set us up we've never taken debate even when antifa attacks us but if you've got a q movement
[02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:46.200]  it's perfect to have globalist informants and foundation operatives and deep staters that are
[02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:51.800]  in the fbi particularly go out reach out wind up people believing they're working with the president
[02:10:52.680 --> 02:10:58.360]  to attack a dam or to go kill the gambino crime boss or to kill their brother with a sword or
[02:10:58.360 --> 02:11:04.840]  whatever and it becomes this giant cauldron now because they identify whether they can then
[02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:10.920]  be set up and then that can be the excuse to see oh it's not just antifa no no no q did this
[02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:15.720]  the whole thing reeked from the beginning until of course he i think it's a setup i
[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:19.560]  most of stuff out of forechan you know ends up being a joke or a prank or whatever
[02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:22.840]  this is a perfect thing for an intelligence agency you know they're trying to shut me down
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:27.640]  an info wars down not they don't want to shut down forechan or achan they're like oh no it's
[02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:31.000]  really good it's really great i'm like okay whatever you're getting a lot of traffic off of it because
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:38.040]  google doesn't censor q talk but it censors me i said that that's the number one suspicion right
[02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:42.520]  there you know any schizophrenic saying i'm you know this or that or jones is about to go to
[02:11:42.520 --> 02:11:52.840]  prison they're pushed but i'm banned well here it is this is yahoo top of yahoo exclusive fbi
[02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:59.000]  document warren's conspiracy theories are new domestic terror threat and it says you know the
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:02.840]  belief in the world government believe in the world order of us q and on a shadowy network
[02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:08.040]  that believes in deep state conspiracies well the deep state is a shadowy network
[02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:12.840]  and the theory of pedophilia including clinton associates are being run on the basement of
[02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:18.600]  washington dc pizzeria know that she uses pedophilia to control people and they go on and say oh
[02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:25.320]  conspiracy theory is now associated with terror and oh look q and on tried to you know attack
[02:12:25.320 --> 02:12:30.120]  the hoover dam whether that's true or not and man's suspected of killing gambino mob boss drew
[02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:34.440]  q and on symbol on his hand this poor guy thought federal marshals were going to let him go and
[02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:41.960]  trump was going to pardon him and they all got this crazy look there in contact with the president
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:46.200]  meanwhile i've talked to president many times on the phone the president tweets out our stuff all
[02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:51.800]  the time and our reporter stuff all the time and i i'm not going to get into it all but the president
[02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:57.640]  told me keep up what you're doing great job keep up press the attack and then i talked to the national
[02:12:57.640 --> 02:13:03.320]  fox host every week i i get intel from them everything i'm up here i'm a real guy 25 years
[02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:10.120]  on air i have no credit i'm not even just chop liver well the president tweets your stuff that's
[02:13:10.120 --> 02:13:15.320]  not q level in fact the president's not even q level there's an alien above him that's q
[02:13:15.960 --> 02:13:20.360]  it's all just a bunch of delusional crazies wanting to be part of something special
[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:24.280]  so when you're already part of the america you're already part of getting trump elected
[02:13:24.280 --> 02:13:29.640]  you're already a patriot and you're interfacing on the internet just like you're a 10 year old
[02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:33.480]  girl thinks she's talking to a 10 year old boy and it's some 40 year old pedophile trying to
[02:13:33.480 --> 02:13:38.840]  trick you to you know go meet him in a park somewhere you end up dead and i have to have
[02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:41.400]  the conversations i have with my daughter it's about being on the internet you know
[02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:43.880]  don't ever talk to anybody you don't know don't don't ever do this or that
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:49.320]  and they listen to me but the general public once they've already been well i'm part of q
[02:13:49.320 --> 02:13:55.000]  and i'm not bad now you're not part of q you're an american who's awake and already involved
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:14:00.200]  who then hears q say a bunch of things you agree with who then wants to feel like you're part of
[02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:09.480]  something secret like this was an email from prince ababa camunda of nigeria i have fight 15
[02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:13.960]  million dollars in the new york bank but i cannot get it out because of my cousin he has caused me
[02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:19.160]  a problem but i get 1000 from you i heard you're a good person from good people you know i am
[02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:26.040]  special you will get you will get you will get one million for the 1000 you send the 1000 and
[02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:31.400]  then it doesn't come back and you're like oh it's all right i need 10 000 you'll get five million
[02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:37.800]  now oh thank you prince bubu we are sorry we cannot send the money we need 20 000 but i will
[02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:43.640]  fly myself to meet you after money i'll get to meet the royal highness you will meet him
[02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:52.920]  um and so this is how the scam works you get so invested in the hallucination
[02:14:55.800 --> 02:15:00.840]  that then you can't believe you've been caught and see they can't get the patriots to do anything
[02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:06.600]  so now it's q they can stage it and say it's q that they now says the patriot movement and
[02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:13.000]  that i supposedly run the new york time says or they can wind up crazies to think they're going
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:18.840]  to get a secret box of information at a parking garage like arlington road and you walk in to get
[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:24.920]  the secret box of documents because trump ordered you there and the car bomb goes off with all your
[02:15:24.920 --> 02:15:30.520]  info that's in a briefcase a mile away so don't go in that parking garage some of you're probably
[02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:33.960]  pissing right now i'm already getting calls to the parking garage yeah they're already testing
[02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:38.920]  you dumbass so you want to go walk into a truck bomb or you want to get set up because you're
[02:15:38.920 --> 02:15:44.680]  talking to the president i don't just talk to the president my lister's got him elected
[02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:54.040]  we're the dog trumps the tail the american people are bigger than trump you stupid ass q cult members

[02:19:25.400 --> 02:19:30.760]  longevity when you protect your telomere so i started looking into dna force plus but it's
[02:19:30.760 --> 02:19:36.600]  expensive why because it is an elite supplement and then i started seeing other competitors
[02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:41.720]  coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support and they came and they went
[02:19:41.720 --> 02:19:48.280]  but dna force plus is still there it is the elite supplement i get excited when dna force plus is
[02:19:48.280 --> 02:19:54.920]  on sale because i know it's expensive so you should take advantage of 50 off dna force plus at info
[02:19:54.920 --> 02:20:13.160]  wars store dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:20:25.880 --> 02:20:37.160]  so
[02:20:50.440 --> 02:20:53.720]  ladies and gentlemen we're live broadcasting worldwide on your host alex jones
[02:20:53.720 --> 02:21:00.600]  we're going to our guest joey gibson who's just been over in hong kong and asia for a few weeks
[02:21:00.600 --> 02:21:05.560]  you've been part of the protest and you've got the you've got the chinese military openly preparing
[02:21:05.560 --> 02:21:10.440]  to invade right now and there's a whole history there this is a major escalations that are taking
[02:21:10.440 --> 02:21:14.280]  place the chinese military will have before your next segment has released a very threatening
[02:21:14.280 --> 02:21:21.560]  ominous video meaning to intimidate the people there will have that as well we'll also continue
[02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:28.280]  with your calls but i want to finish up with the fbi remember it was a big deal when we got the
[02:21:28.280 --> 02:21:38.920]  secret documents 10 years ago from the fbi from the federal marshals from the state police the
[02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:44.440]  federal marshals got it from the fbi and people said it was fake and they said no it's real alex
[02:21:44.440 --> 02:21:52.920]  jones broke secret state police report ron paul bob bar chuck balvin libertarians veterans you name
[02:21:52.920 --> 02:22:01.480]  it as terrorist we got it from a missouri state police version we got a california state police
[02:22:01.480 --> 02:22:08.840]  version now why is that important because joey gibson and his patriot pair group are public
[02:22:08.840 --> 02:22:14.920]  and they're nonviolent and they stand up to antifa a real terror organization info wars is a real
[02:22:14.920 --> 02:22:19.000]  group you know we got the real document about how they were saying that mainline conservatives
[02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:26.280]  were terrorists and obama had to admit that was true it was a national story well now yahu today
[02:22:26.280 --> 02:22:32.680]  exclusive fbi document orange conspiracy theories are a new domestic terror threat because of qanon
[02:22:32.680 --> 02:22:41.480]  and the fact that people are going out and committing acts of violence in the name of qanon
[02:22:41.480 --> 02:22:43.720]  believing trump told him to do so
[02:22:48.520 --> 02:22:50.440]  even though the outgoing press secretary
[02:22:53.720 --> 02:22:57.880]  sarah huckabee sanders when asked about it said we're not part of that and if you go to the wikipedia
[02:22:57.880 --> 02:23:03.800]  run by the globalists it's got a big picture of prouder county police put q on and then went and
[02:23:03.800 --> 02:23:09.320]  when the vice president got off a plane so that's their proof look q's legitimate because they were
[02:23:09.320 --> 02:23:17.880]  next to mike pence it's it's just it's just amazing and you can see the setup now when
[02:23:17.880 --> 02:23:22.520]  antifa carries out their terror they're going to have people in the name of q do more of this
[02:23:22.520 --> 02:23:28.440]  and then they're making fun of us some of them so mind controlled by the internet
[02:23:28.440 --> 02:23:32.760]  that they literally believe trump is ordering them to go do these things
[02:23:36.440 --> 02:23:39.080]  and then they're thinking that trump's coming to save him in the jail cell
[02:23:40.280 --> 02:23:45.800]  when they shoot people that's leftist mind control that's them making fun of us the perfect
[02:23:45.800 --> 02:23:49.160]  psychological warfare system here's sarah huckabee sanders
[02:23:49.160 --> 02:23:53.720]  about last night tampa does first of all the president encouraged the support of people who
[02:23:53.720 --> 02:23:59.560]  showed up last night in these q anon and blacks for trump fringe groups and secondly is the white
[02:23:59.560 --> 02:24:04.760]  house willing to say right now in view of what happened with one of our tv colleagues last night
[02:24:04.760 --> 02:24:09.320]  that it is wrong for his most vocal supporters to be menacing toward journalists doing their
[02:24:09.320 --> 02:24:15.320]  jobs in a situation like that or in any situation on the first part the president condemns and
[02:24:15.320 --> 02:24:22.280]  denounces any group that would incite violence against another individual and certainly doesn't
[02:24:22.280 --> 02:24:27.880]  support groups that would promote that type of behavior we've we've been clear about that a
[02:24:27.880 --> 02:24:33.080]  number of times since the beginning of the administration on the second part of your question
[02:24:34.280 --> 02:24:40.600]  the president as i just said does not support violence against anyone and or anything and
[02:24:40.600 --> 02:24:46.680]  we've been very clear every single time we've been asked about that when it comes to the media the
[02:24:46.680 --> 02:24:53.480]  president does think that the media holds a responsibility uh we so fully support a free
[02:24:53.480 --> 02:24:58.920]  press but there also comes a high level of responsibility with that the media routinely
[02:24:58.920 --> 02:25:05.000]  reports on classified information and government i want to go to joey gibson and then i'm going
[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:09.880]  to host some of the next hour but we have another great host matt bracken taken over as well i got
[02:25:09.880 --> 02:25:15.880]  so much to hit but i'm not just trying to pick a fight here with q q is just some anonymous thing
[02:25:15.880 --> 02:25:20.040]  that could be the fbi could be george soros could be a nice person could be a bad person i'm trying
[02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:24.920]  to be able to figure out how dangerous this is and how i knew they need to somehow set up the right
[02:25:24.920 --> 02:25:29.960]  wing and i've known it's going to be q and now these things are provocaturing there but these
[02:25:29.960 --> 02:25:34.760]  are intelligence agents manipulating mentally ill and gullible people i'm not saying everybody
[02:25:34.760 --> 02:25:39.480]  involved with q is that but i'm saying we can clearly see where it's going and then meanwhile
[02:25:39.480 --> 02:25:44.280]  trump tweets our stuff trump comes on the show i talk to trump sometimes i talk to his associates
[02:25:44.280 --> 02:25:50.040]  all the time you know we really are here we're real joey you're real but then some nebulous thing
[02:25:50.040 --> 02:25:55.720]  we've all got to bow down and follow orders from what do you think yeah i'm definitely real and i
[02:25:55.720 --> 02:26:00.760]  think that people got to show their faces and got to get up you have to be a symbol for the people
[02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:05.320]  and so i definitely think we should pay attention to people who are real and you can see their faces
[02:26:05.320 --> 02:26:10.440]  and and see them talk yeah notice what a q and and if i have in common you can't see their faces
[02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:17.640]  yeah absolutely and it is concerning i mean q's said some things that are very appealing
[02:26:18.280 --> 02:26:22.440]  but i don't know too much about them i definitely think that people always have to be careful and
[02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:26.600]  you can't just trust you know something that's not even real i'm just simply saying it's the
[02:26:26.600 --> 02:26:32.280]  perfect cut out now to say that they'll look there are right wing terrorists oh antifa's good
[02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:35.960]  oh the white people are all committing terror attacks all that's made up and then you start
[02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:40.440]  seeing these murders and things with mentally ill people wound up by these these folks posing as
[02:26:40.440 --> 02:26:44.920]  this supposed cute thing i mean i can see this as the next stage but but i got you on late i
[02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:51.080]  appreciate you coming on you just got back from asia i know you've got the ties back there chinese
[02:26:51.080 --> 02:26:56.120]  government threatening to invade this is a huge deal you were part of the protest what have you
[02:26:56.120 --> 02:27:02.920]  witnessed so basically what i saw is in hong kong has seven and a half million people total
[02:27:02.920 --> 02:27:06.840]  and they had two million people marching in the streets for freedom it was unbelievable and it
[02:27:06.840 --> 02:27:11.480]  doesn't matter if you're on the left you're on the right everybody was fighting for freedom you know
[02:27:11.480 --> 02:27:15.400]  because they don't want china to take over they know what's in store for the future if they allow
[02:27:15.400 --> 02:27:20.440]  china to take over you have lgbt activists marching with christian activists together
[02:27:20.440 --> 02:27:24.360]  because they don't care about the difference of political ideology they only care about freedom
[02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:30.520]  and for me that's like my dream in america right for people to wake up just like you alex to wake
[02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:35.560]  up so that we can fight together right against the people at the top in hong kong that's what i saw
[02:27:35.560 --> 02:27:41.720]  and they all support one another i saw um one of the first protests i was that once the police
[02:27:41.720 --> 02:27:46.520]  started to crack down everyone ran down into the subway station and workers in the subway
[02:27:46.520 --> 02:27:50.760]  station were literally helping people get through and they're closing the gate so police can't come
[02:27:50.760 --> 02:27:55.000]  and get them and they just stopped the train with thousands of people i was stuck in there too
[02:27:55.640 --> 02:28:00.120]  shoulder to shoulder and just got him out there so everybody's going to start over because i

[02:30:04.280 --> 02:30:08.520]  ago before all the censorship of the tax and fake lawsuits the rest of it i would talk about how
[02:30:08.520 --> 02:30:12.120]  great the products are and how they were the best and why they were and i'd have doctors on
[02:30:12.120 --> 02:30:16.040]  an experts to explain why they were so good and instead the last few years i'm like hey we need to
[02:30:16.040 --> 02:30:19.480]  really support us or they'll shut us down the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements
[02:30:19.480 --> 02:30:22.360]  because they know how great they are and how wonderful they work and the left always has
[02:30:22.360 --> 02:30:27.880]  headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements no
[02:30:27.880 --> 02:30:33.880]  under federal law since 1996 you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they
[02:30:33.880 --> 02:30:38.200]  have no jurisdiction and won't look at it but then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them
[02:30:38.200 --> 02:30:42.520]  and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do
[02:30:42.520 --> 02:30:46.360]  different things and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects not with mother nature but

[02:35:35.240 --> 02:35:40.280]  i think that they saw the american flag and they went crazy over it there's people crying and hugging
[02:35:40.280 --> 02:35:45.080]  us taking pictures with the flag they appreciate the american flag more than we do like it was
[02:35:45.080 --> 02:35:50.680]  unbelievable for me the american flag for the rest of the world is a symbol of freedom it's not
[02:35:50.680 --> 02:35:56.840]  just a symbol for america right and so when they saw this their response was unbelievable to me
[02:35:56.840 --> 02:36:02.760]  and the cool thing is that after that every single week since we left they've been flying american
[02:36:02.760 --> 02:36:06.840]  flags themselves so it's really cool and they're asking trump for help but i think that americans
[02:36:06.840 --> 02:36:11.000]  should be very involved with what's going on in hong kong because we don't understand alex you
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:15.800]  understand but the americans don't understand how much of a threat china is to this country and to
[02:36:15.800 --> 02:36:20.920]  this world right they're the biggest threat to america in my opinion they've already infiltrated
[02:36:20.920 --> 02:36:25.720]  this country when i was over there i would see the media the chinese media was doing the exact
[02:36:25.720 --> 02:36:31.400]  same thing that our media here does they're actually posting doctored photos of a protester
[02:36:31.400 --> 02:36:36.200]  as if she had a see-through shirt out she was being arrested so they pull all these nasty tricks
[02:36:36.200 --> 02:36:42.520]  they doxxed all the protesters the leaders um it's unbelievable six years ago several
[02:36:42.520 --> 02:36:49.240]  leaders got arrested in the original umbrella movement they come out then very next day they're
[02:36:49.240 --> 02:36:53.320]  on the streets fighting for freedom with the people this is how passionate they are they will do
[02:36:53.320 --> 02:36:58.200]  anything right to to fight for freedom and let's explain what's happening china is taking over
[02:36:58.200 --> 02:37:02.280]  hong kong and trying to get over taiwan even though they've been semi and totally autonomous
[02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:08.200]  in the case of taiwan and now they're threatening to invade because they're passing a law to secretly
[02:37:08.200 --> 02:37:13.960]  arrest and disappear people yeah extradition bill basically what that will allow is the chinese
[02:37:13.960 --> 02:37:18.120]  government just has to say that you committed a crime in china they can just lie take you out of
[02:37:18.120 --> 02:37:23.000]  hong kong and what's gonna happen is if that bill passes they're just gonna start destroying free
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:27.720]  speech just like they do in china right they just start extraditing all the leaders of the movement
[02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:33.480]  put fear in the people's hearts and uh that'll be into free speech aren't they playing with fire
[02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:38.840]  though because china is already on the edge of toppling taiwan or hong kong could trigger
[02:37:38.840 --> 02:37:42.840]  a resistance that that ends up reverberating into china i don't think this will go the way
[02:37:42.840 --> 02:37:46.840]  tenement square went i don't think there's going to be a stand down well what was the sense if they
[02:37:46.840 --> 02:37:54.040]  send a bunch of chinese military uh with the hong kong uh collaborator government i the people won't
[02:37:54.040 --> 02:37:58.760]  stop but if these people are willing to die for this and so i think it'd be a bad move by china
[02:37:58.760 --> 02:38:03.880]  one of the things that uh i hear a lot from the protesters they believe that if they can secure
[02:38:03.880 --> 02:38:09.000]  their freedom through protesting it's going to send a shock wave throughout all these countries
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:14.200]  like taiwan even tai bet you know tai bet they're still protesting even though they'll arrest thousands
[02:38:14.200 --> 02:38:19.080]  of people and they just disappear so something's happening the people are pushing back and i think
[02:38:19.080 --> 02:38:24.920]  hong kong is the key people really need to be involved and for me the thing that was so inspiring
[02:38:24.920 --> 02:38:31.160]  is that these people are fighting for their freedom while we sit while us in america just
[02:38:31.160 --> 02:38:35.880]  sit around right and we don't do anything we just allow this government to get bigger and bigger
[02:38:35.880 --> 02:38:40.120]  you want to know the future of our country look at china if we don't do something soon
[02:38:42.680 --> 02:38:45.080]  joey gibson what got you over there during this time
[02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:53.000]  basically seeing millions of people march against the communist regime china i was like i have to go
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:58.360]  like there's no way i cannot be part of this and i had to witness it i had to get video i had to
[02:38:58.360 --> 02:39:04.680]  interview people i just had to experience it and it was a life changing event for me it opened me up
[02:39:04.680 --> 02:39:11.320]  a lot and it made me it was encouraging because what i always dreamed of in america right sometimes
[02:39:11.320 --> 02:39:16.360]  it just seems impossible but then to see it in real life in hong kong it was unbelievable it's
[02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:21.240]  like it is possible you just have to wake people up people have to understand what's in store for
[02:39:21.240 --> 02:39:26.360]  a future because in hong kong the advantage they have is they know what's in store for the future
[02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:30.200]  they can look at china and they can see what's going to happen to them their free speech will be
[02:39:30.200 --> 02:39:35.880]  destroyed free religion will be destroyed right uh censoring the internet so but for us in america
[02:39:36.600 --> 02:39:40.520]  a lot of us aren't awake yet we don't understand what's in store for a future we don't understand
[02:39:40.520 --> 02:39:47.080]  the tyranny that's taken over this country and so many of their grandparents either got killed
[02:39:47.080 --> 02:39:53.480]  or barely escaped or their parents they know that china is killed five times what hitler killed
[02:39:55.560 --> 02:40:00.840]  yeah china is literally has slaves in their country right now right now they have the
[02:40:00.840 --> 02:40:04.440]  suicide nets in the warehouses so people can't kill themselves because they're so miserable
[02:40:05.080 --> 02:40:10.840]  people got to wake up at how bad china really is i mean china is just destroying our country right
[02:40:10.840 --> 02:40:15.240]  now it's from the inside out you know buying everything up you saw what happened with that
[02:40:15.240 --> 02:40:20.920]  that movie where they they took down the taiwan flag um because it's all hollywood now yeah top
[02:40:20.920 --> 02:40:26.520]  gun it's very concerning it's very concerning to me and i know that facebook and google and
[02:40:26.520 --> 02:40:31.480]  all these other social media outlets are working with china they're they're it's the same game plan
[02:40:31.480 --> 02:40:34.600]  that they're putting in america just slower that that's happening in china right now
[02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:43.160]  and big text backing them yes absolutely and why does no one say anything about that right
[02:40:43.160 --> 02:40:49.320]  they're literally helping china find uh find people arrest them and execute them like that's
[02:40:49.320 --> 02:40:54.760]  that's what facebook is about right in china right now and so i think people need to understand
[02:40:54.760 --> 02:41:01.080]  if you're liberal and you're like obsessed with the racist history or whatever in america okay great
[02:41:01.080 --> 02:41:06.120]  but what about the the slavery that's happening right now in china what about the people that
[02:41:06.120 --> 02:41:12.200]  are being executed because they're christians in china right now oh what about the millions of muslims
[02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:17.320]  that have been executed or put in concentration camps does anyone on the left complain about that
[02:41:17.320 --> 02:41:24.760]  i haven't heard anything what's happened to the left were they always just bad
[02:41:26.920 --> 02:41:30.600]  i don't i i don't know what's happening they used to be a lot more moderate they used to be more
[02:41:30.600 --> 02:41:35.720]  like uh tulsi gabard i gotta give a huge shout out to her by the way she's the only real democrat
[02:41:35.720 --> 02:41:40.200]  that i see running right now like a actual like original progressive that speaks from her heart
[02:41:40.200 --> 02:41:47.480]  and isn't being controlled by some weird person up above but yeah i think the left right now
[02:41:47.480 --> 02:41:53.880]  is probably starting for like real politicians like who are real people like trope but i don't
[02:41:53.880 --> 02:41:59.560]  know it's gone so far to the left it's all about rhetoric it's emotional and it's it's really
[02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:04.120]  frustrating i mean and the lies are unbelievable right now the deception happening in this country
[02:42:04.120 --> 02:42:10.440]  just like in china is it's biblical everything's upside down right now i'll tell you this footage
[02:42:10.440 --> 02:42:16.120]  you shot is amazing and this is just ongoing all because they don't want china to absorb them
[02:42:17.080 --> 02:42:21.080]  into the mother country which is china itself is collapsing
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:28.920]  yeah absolutely i think that uh this is what's amazing is that hong kong's been free for a long
[02:42:28.920 --> 02:42:35.800]  time now um for almost a hundred years and so they have a culture of freedom they're family members
[02:42:35.800 --> 02:42:41.080]  they think about their children they think about the future of their children and they cannot accept
[02:42:41.080 --> 02:42:45.400]  handing over their freedom to this communist regime they will not accept it that's right we need
[02:42:45.400 --> 02:42:52.120]  hong kong and taiwan to invade china politically we need to we need to free china not to have china
[02:42:52.120 --> 02:42:58.920]  expand and a giant cancer stay with us before i started working at info wars i was not only a fan
[02:42:58.920 --> 02:43:03.880]  of alex jones at info wars dot com but also the products at info wars store dot com and there's one
[02:43:03.880 --> 02:43:09.320]  product that's offered at info wars store dot com that is the elite of the supplements and that's
[02:43:09.320 --> 02:43:13.800]  dna force plus now i remember when alex first started talking about this with some of his special
[02:43:13.800 --> 02:43:20.040]  guests telomeres and telomere support with your dna and so i started to look into the science and
[02:43:20.040 --> 02:43:26.760]  what telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres
[02:43:26.760 --> 02:43:33.240]  so i started looking into dna force plus but it's expensive why because it is an elite supplement
[02:43:33.240 --> 02:43:38.040]  and then i started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere
[02:43:38.040 --> 02:43:45.160]  support and they came and they went but dna force plus is still there it is the elite supplement
[02:43:45.160 --> 02:43:50.200]  i get excited when dna force plus is on sale because i know it's expensive so you should take
[02:43:50.200 --> 02:43:57.800]  advantage of 50 off dna force plus at info wars store dot com the globalists are hyper competitive
[02:43:57.800 --> 02:44:02.840]  scientific dictators they are technocrats they are control freaks in their own words and they

[02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:22.440]  really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies if i wasn't taking the highest quality

[02:44:59.960 --> 02:45:04.120]  telling the truth is a revolutionary act and so used to it wasn't that important to wear the
[02:45:04.120 --> 02:45:08.440]  american flag because we still loved our country and there wasn't a large group of people that
[02:45:08.440 --> 02:45:13.480]  actually hated it but now they're trying to take it out of schools they're taking it down off of
[02:45:13.480 --> 02:45:18.200]  government buildings weird white leftist that one of virtually singular pulling down american flags
[02:45:18.200 --> 02:45:24.040]  and running up mexican flags this is the bizarreness of the america hating we're seeing so now it is a
[02:45:24.040 --> 02:45:29.000]  revolutionary act at the time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying to wear the american
[02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:34.360]  flag particularly the betsy ross anti-slavery flag and particularly when it says on the back
[02:45:34.360 --> 02:45:40.840]  right there ladies and gentlemen america's back info wars dot com so whatever you do take action

[02:45:46.440 --> 02:45:49.880]  because more than ever the american flag is a symbol of freedom against globalism
[02:45:56.600 --> 02:46:01.480]  alec yes i got a plug for the patriot points i get oh thanks i got 180 dollars so far this
[02:46:01.480 --> 02:46:05.800]  year and i feel like i'm stealing from you i buy so much in the store because i mean i don't want
[02:46:05.800 --> 02:46:08.920]  to get that money to walmart i don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to
[02:46:08.920 --> 02:46:12.840]  causes i don't believe in so i'd rather give that money to you and i'm getting quality product the
[02:46:12.840 --> 02:46:17.640]  products that i do receive have changed my life i mean the x2 has really done a lot for me i've
[02:46:17.640 --> 02:46:22.360]  lost weight my brain works a whole lot better i think my kids they use the toothpaste my son used
[02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:26.520]  to get these little sore throats and he puts x2 in water and drinks it and it gets rid of his
[02:46:26.520 --> 02:46:31.000]  sore throat well sir let me break this down for you i want high quality stuff in there i want a
[02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:36.200]  good price but i've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50 off i'm making
[02:46:36.200 --> 02:46:40.680]  two dollars on the toothpaste 50 off and so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric
[02:46:40.680 --> 02:46:45.400]  or the bone broth thank you so much for the plugs but listen when people get the patriot points a lot
[02:46:45.400 --> 02:46:49.480]  of times it makes things a loss leader because if you're already getting 10 off because you're on
[02:46:49.480 --> 02:46:54.120]  autoship then we're doing 50 off and then you do something like that uh we have patriot points we
[02:46:54.120 --> 02:47:10.040]  lose money but that's okay thanks for the support you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:47:25.080 --> 02:47:28.440]  China well the back of the alex jones show
[02:47:30.360 --> 02:47:36.120]  has killed way more than the russians under communism or the nazis and the germans under
[02:47:36.120 --> 02:47:43.960]  hitler did but we just oh they're they're not white people running it so it's it's a good it's
[02:47:43.960 --> 02:47:49.800]  liberal now it's a giant slave camp the globalist industries have used and built up and now it's
[02:47:49.800 --> 02:47:56.840]  ready to expand to take over taiwan to take over hong kong the south china sea building all these
[02:47:56.840 --> 02:48:02.680]  military bases building dredging out the ocean and building islands and putting weapons on it
[02:48:04.360 --> 02:48:09.720]  china is expansionist because it's been given unlimited money it's been given an unlimited
[02:48:09.720 --> 02:48:16.840]  funding it's been given 10 percent year after year growth rates by the traders in our government
[02:48:16.840 --> 02:48:21.720]  and trump is stopping that he's just saying hey you're not going to make 100 on us you're going to
[02:48:21.720 --> 02:48:27.960]  make 80 percent he's just taking a little back and it's everybody's flipping out because china
[02:48:27.960 --> 02:48:32.440]  bought up our debt they bought a polywood this was all done strategically by the globalist against
[02:48:32.440 --> 02:48:37.560]  the country and joey gibson was just over in hong kong it just got back and is showing this amazing
[02:48:37.560 --> 02:48:43.960]  footage uh and uh while you're talking we're going to roll china warns hong kong protesters with
[02:48:43.960 --> 02:48:49.320]  slick military video uh you're basically letting them know we can crush you uh what are you gut
[02:48:49.320 --> 02:48:53.400]  level talking to folks we were there just a few days ago what are you thinking about the massing
[02:48:53.400 --> 02:48:57.960]  trips about to come in reportedly or the plain clothes pair of military they say came across
[02:48:57.960 --> 02:49:04.200]  uh just a few days ago yeah i definitely think they're just trying to put fear into the protest
[02:49:04.200 --> 02:49:09.320]  as hard state they need to stop the protest china does it is a threat to their security
[02:49:09.320 --> 02:49:15.000]  okay so it's a really big deal what's going on there now one of the things that they did in 2012
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:19.320]  the police were really rough on the original umbrella movement like really rough and they
[02:49:19.320 --> 02:49:24.680]  arrested a bunch of them and the protesters stop and then several years later you know it erupted
[02:49:24.680 --> 02:49:29.560]  again but this time when the police were too rough there was such an outcry that more protesters
[02:49:29.560 --> 02:49:34.760]  would come out um like i said at one point there was almost two million protesters on the streets
[02:49:34.760 --> 02:49:39.800]  now what china did and this is very frustrating because it's just like antifa right they send
[02:49:39.800 --> 02:49:44.520]  in a bunch of thugs wearing white shirts some of them look like police officers in my opinion
[02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:49.560]  watching them and they just started beating up a bunch of random citizens down on the train
[02:49:49.560 --> 02:49:55.720]  station the video was very hard to watch these women were screaming for help and no police came
[02:49:55.720 --> 02:50:00.840]  to their aid we're talking about i think it was like 30 or 45 minutes these thugs were allowed to
[02:50:00.840 --> 02:50:05.800]  run free in in the train station and just beat up random people especially anyone that's wearing
[02:50:05.800 --> 02:50:08.840]  a black shirt because that's what the process but don't they know like when the chinese tried
[02:50:08.840 --> 02:50:12.440]  to take over vietnam that didn't work or anywhere else i mean i think knowing the history of the
[02:50:12.440 --> 02:50:16.920]  area i think this is going to don't these troops know they're going to end up being at bars and
[02:50:16.920 --> 02:50:24.040]  clubs when a woman walks up at stabs them in the throat yeah absolutely oh one of the things too
[02:50:24.040 --> 02:50:29.800]  that concern me about uh them sending in these people who are wearing plain clothes like i said
[02:50:29.800 --> 02:50:34.520]  one of the best things that hong kong has going for it is that all the people are united and so
[02:50:34.520 --> 02:50:40.920]  if they start to start these fights with other citizens per se it's going to cause division
[02:50:40.920 --> 02:50:45.960]  paranoia um and i think that it could be detrimental to the community because that's
[02:50:45.960 --> 02:50:50.440]  basically what happened in america they they basically just split us all apart so we fight
[02:50:50.440 --> 02:50:56.280]  with one another not just physically but obviously you know with the politically and so we fight with
[02:50:56.280 --> 02:51:00.840]  each other instead of fighting against our government and the establishment figures and so that what
[02:51:00.840 --> 02:51:05.240]  you're saying is you see real unity like we see unity in japan there's less crime there than anywhere
[02:51:05.240 --> 02:51:10.760]  in the world but less crime even more so like almost zero they say during an earthquake versus
[02:51:10.760 --> 02:51:16.360]  here there was an earthquake to be looting everywhere absolutely one of the things that i noticed is
[02:51:16.360 --> 02:51:22.280]  of course the only two white guys on the whole island find me with an american flag and he just
[02:51:22.280 --> 02:51:27.080]  starts going off on me yelling at me calling me a fascist calling trump a fascist and there's
[02:51:27.080 --> 02:51:32.200]  concentration camps all the the far left talking points from america right these guys and these
[02:51:32.200 --> 02:51:36.600]  guys would not leave me alone one guy looked like a methad like it was unbelievable but the thing
[02:51:36.600 --> 02:51:41.720]  that i noticed is that i you know the way that i am i i kind of talk back and stuff and i get kind
[02:51:41.720 --> 02:51:46.680]  of mad i get into it and stuff so many people kept they were following me around for oh you're not a
[02:51:46.680 --> 02:51:53.720]  little guy either no no i'm a fighter i just don't fight because i made a commitment to god
[02:51:53.720 --> 02:51:59.720]  they'll be nonviolent but these guys kept following me around and i'll stick up for myself but so many
[02:51:59.720 --> 02:52:04.760]  people kept coming up to me being like joey just just stop talking to them they're like don't even
[02:52:04.760 --> 02:52:09.320]  worry about them we want you here we want your american flag here just do what you want to do
[02:52:09.320 --> 02:52:15.560]  ignore them and so i kind of took i understand that in in hong kong and a lot of asian countries
[02:52:15.560 --> 02:52:20.520]  asian cultures a big part of it is collective it's working together right it's not it's not fighting
[02:52:20.520 --> 02:52:24.280]  like you said they don't loot you know they help each other out and that's a big part of the culture
[02:52:24.280 --> 02:52:29.880]  they don't like seeing the fighting and america we like to see the fighting like we like to see
[02:52:29.880 --> 02:52:33.880]  the going back and forth but it seems like they're ready to fight now though
[02:52:36.200 --> 02:52:41.160]  yeah absolutely uh they're way more peaceful than americans would be but i saw some footage
[02:52:41.160 --> 02:52:47.160]  they're starting to fight back they're very upset about the triad gang coming in and beating them up
[02:52:47.160 --> 02:52:52.920]  it was amazing to me and notice they use the same little extension foils that can kill somebody if
[02:52:52.920 --> 02:52:58.040]  you had them on the arteries to just sit there and it's like a car antenna just beating random
[02:52:58.040 --> 02:53:03.400]  people at a train station yeah yeah there's some pictures of people with their shirts off after
[02:53:03.400 --> 02:53:09.160]  and it's really bad like but the interesting thing though this is how strong they're in hong kong
[02:53:09.160 --> 02:53:13.480]  you know these these people are just getting beat up left and right yelling and screaming asking
[02:53:13.480 --> 02:53:19.640]  you know for mercy and then uh the next week they went they had a huge march right into the
[02:53:19.640 --> 02:53:23.960]  neighborhoods where they felt like the tribes were from so they're not going to say they're taking
[02:53:23.960 --> 02:53:28.440]  over government buildings they're not they're not they're not they're injecting heroin like left
[02:53:28.440 --> 02:53:35.000]  to start protests they're they're fighting hard yes they are that's and i'm convinced that they
[02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:41.160]  will fight to the very end you know it's it's sad to say but people are gonna die before they give
[02:53:41.160 --> 02:53:44.920]  up their freedom i mean that's just the way it is and the thing that a lot of them talk about they
[02:53:44.920 --> 02:53:50.600]  talk about their kids right they say they don't they want freedom for their kids and when you are
[02:53:50.600 --> 02:53:55.800]  thinking about your kids and future generations you will do anything right way more than you'll do
[02:53:55.800 --> 02:54:00.280]  for yourself especially i think about my children that's what motivates me to do what i do and to
[02:54:00.280 --> 02:54:07.320]  spread the message of freedom and liberty well you're just amazing and because i'm for radio
[02:54:07.320 --> 02:54:12.600]  listeners you're not seeing this i mean this fun as you shot you were in the middle of this stuff
[02:54:12.600 --> 02:54:19.240]  for how many days uh we're there for about nine days but yeah i basically always on the front
[02:54:19.240 --> 02:54:25.400]  lines waving my american flag to the police like they didn't like it but everyone else did because
[02:54:25.400 --> 02:54:30.840]  it was like there's an american with us on the front lines promoting freedom with us you know
[02:54:30.840 --> 02:54:35.960]  and that means a lot to them because they feel alone that's the thing all they have is each other
[02:54:35.960 --> 02:54:40.680]  they feel alone and they're begging for help not necessarily military help because i don't think
[02:54:40.680 --> 02:54:46.520]  we can i don't think that's a good idea political pressure political pressure they want the support
[02:54:46.520 --> 02:54:52.040]  they want if the world pulls together for them it will help them a lot both well they know the
[02:54:52.040 --> 02:54:55.000]  party officials are going to come in and take everything they've raised everything they've
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:58.520]  done and they know they're taking people's organs and killing whoever they want them and they know
[02:54:58.520 --> 02:55:03.480]  an evil demonic mafia is about to fully take them over why wouldn't they fight for their lives
[02:55:04.680 --> 02:55:08.360]  yeah they they have the internet is uncensored right now in hong kong
[02:55:09.160 --> 02:55:13.880]  and so they know exactly what's happening in china they know everything that you know alex
[02:55:13.880 --> 02:55:17.800]  everything that you've been talking about they talk about and they know they talk about harvesting
[02:55:17.800 --> 02:55:23.640]  the organs they talk about the executions they talk about the uh the concentration camps they
[02:55:23.640 --> 02:55:30.280]  know all of that so yeah these are real concentration camps not the made up ones from aoc real ones
[02:55:31.320 --> 02:55:37.240]  ones that have millions of muslims in them like this is the real deal right now but nobody talks
[02:55:37.240 --> 02:55:43.400]  about it the way the thing is too is there's there's people in america who's been speaking out against
[02:55:43.400 --> 02:55:50.280]  china and china goes after them they will hack their computers there's there's one one it's already
[02:55:50.280 --> 02:55:53.560]  happened to us i mean that's that's who funds hollywood the whole nine yards is the chikoms
[02:55:55.480 --> 02:56:01.720]  there's a woman who's been speaking out against china and china got some photos of her uh naked
[02:56:01.720 --> 02:56:06.040]  and posted it everywhere with her phone number saying that she's a prostitute and stuff and
[02:56:06.040 --> 02:56:10.680]  she was getting tons of phone calls from people trying to buy her and stuff but this is the dirty
[02:56:10.680 --> 02:56:15.560]  tricks that they play and and the thing is about china is they're so afraid of the truth so for it
[02:56:15.560 --> 02:56:19.240]  i mean well they want to fight joey they're gonna get one i think they're biting on more than they
[02:56:19.240 --> 02:56:26.600]  can chew uh in taiwan and in hong kong what do you think yeah absolutely and they don't know
[02:56:26.600 --> 02:56:31.560]  what to do they're out of options right now they know that if they send in the military there's
[02:56:31.560 --> 02:56:37.480]  going to be uh outcry from all over the world but um at the same time they kind of they didn't say
[02:56:37.480 --> 02:56:42.760]  tibet no one really caused any problems uh they have yeah well that's up on the roof of the world
[02:56:42.760 --> 02:56:47.800]  with nobody around it this is right in the middle of the major shipping lanes right next to japan

[02:57:56.440 --> 02:58:01.080]  that's why the globalists are obsessed with it trying to shut it down i didn't invent all this
[02:58:01.080 --> 02:58:06.360]  i went and researched the renaissance americana and what really works for humanity and i'm simply
[02:58:06.360 --> 02:58:12.040]  trying to bring it back and lo and behold it's super popular like it's always been that's why the
[02:58:12.040 --> 02:58:17.800]  globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the light in the dark of the night

[02:58:59.160 --> 02:59:06.760]  and sovereignty is being challenged the world is going to change and how it changes will likely be
[02:59:06.760 --> 02:59:13.800]  decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails the system is vulnerable
[02:59:13.800 --> 02:59:20.520]  electricity could be gone in an instant and grocery stores could be empty in three days having

[03:00:33.800 --> 03:00:43.000]  holding wow that was a pretty powerful interview with the head of the patriot prayer group joey gibson
[03:00:43.320 --> 03:00:48.280]  yeah no by all means that was awesome and that kind of speaks a little bit to my point
[03:00:48.840 --> 03:00:53.640]  first thing i wanted to do was i wanted to plug a couple of products i wake up every morning
[03:00:53.640 --> 03:01:01.320]  and i drink a shake of bone broth and i also do the turbo force and i just turned 44 years old
[03:01:01.320 --> 03:01:06.200]  and i feel better than i felt all through my 20s i mean i just gotta say that stuff is awesome
[03:01:06.200 --> 03:01:11.720]  super charge of you oh they were awesome the bone broth is this great crew putting up with me all
[03:01:11.720 --> 03:01:16.280]  week and the listeners but absolutely bone broth we do the bone broth was the big hot you know
[03:01:16.280 --> 03:01:20.920]  cutting-edge thing so we went out and made the strongest one out there so yeah thank you so much
[03:01:20.920 --> 03:01:27.640]  for the support go ahead sir well you know that kind of lends itself to what i kind of feel like
[03:01:27.640 --> 03:01:33.800]  has happened with me especially in the in the last few years is every day i wake up i feel like
[03:01:33.800 --> 03:01:39.080]  there's just this big force just saying kneel before his dog you know just like in the movie
[03:01:39.080 --> 03:01:47.400]  where they're just like asking me to kneel before this evil dictator who's just come to earth and
[03:01:47.400 --> 03:01:55.240]  what i what i feel like god represents at this point that we cannot kneel before is you know
[03:01:55.240 --> 03:02:01.160]  this whole notion that white people are bad and they need to be replaced this is just constantly
[03:02:01.160 --> 03:02:06.520]  being forced on us that we need to have open borders and that people should just be able to
[03:02:06.520 --> 03:02:11.640]  come into this country and receive and that's because the globalists want the post-industrial
[03:02:11.640 --> 03:02:16.520]  world they want they don't want the christian idea of empowering an industry and and and life and
[03:02:16.520 --> 03:02:22.280]  loving they want barbarism and collapse of civilization and not thought and not who's
[03:02:22.280 --> 03:02:27.960]  god is and now too i refuse to kneel down to and i feel like they're offering me saying hey
[03:02:27.960 --> 03:02:33.400]  you can be successful you can be popular you can have money all you got to do is just hate yourself
[03:02:33.400 --> 03:02:38.840]  for being white and renounce your christian faith and you know it's all part of the the social media
[03:02:38.840 --> 03:02:45.720]  is part of it now the fed is part of it now you know uh i feel like the schools have been taken over
[03:02:45.720 --> 03:02:52.600]  by communists and not only colleges i went to uc santa crews and i mean they were they were telling
[03:02:52.600 --> 03:02:57.960]  me that you know because i was one of my classes was studying daunte and they're saying oh yeah do
[03:02:57.960 --> 03:03:03.560]  you notice the homoerotic bond between daunte and virtual and i would like raise my hand and say no
[03:03:03.560 --> 03:03:07.960]  that's not anything to do with homosexuality it's all christian and they would be like looking at
[03:03:07.960 --> 03:03:12.360]  me like you evil wicked man how could you say these things you know and it's just like well that's
[03:03:12.360 --> 03:03:18.440]  it i mean there's a total demonization of the existing order to bring an order that is absolutely
[03:03:18.440 --> 03:03:25.800]  devoid of god thank you mike judy says that the fight is against evil the battle's not against

[03:06:30.440 --> 03:06:33.000]  there they are all kneeling down to zod
[03:06:35.400 --> 03:06:40.360]  we're bringing back the silent movie here ladies and gentlemen we'll we'll do a start of the next
[03:06:40.360 --> 03:06:45.800]  segment that's the fun part about these computers okay let's go ahead and go back to the caller
[03:06:47.240 --> 03:06:55.320]  kaleb in arkansas uh was bringing up the fact that he's at work he's in a warehouse and the
[03:06:55.320 --> 03:07:00.680]  warehouse has the rule no audio well that's fine but i've got a warehouse and if people are doing
[03:07:00.680 --> 03:07:06.840]  packing or whatever they can listen to their audio uh but the caller was saying no no it's
[03:07:06.840 --> 03:07:12.360]  specifically alex jones he can't listen to they want to control what's going on in his brain
[03:07:12.360 --> 03:07:18.280]  this is the authoritarianism that's seeping into every aspect of life so so kaleb describe what
[03:07:18.280 --> 03:07:26.040]  this is like for us it's ridiculous i mean it at first it was like no we're going to take away
[03:07:26.040 --> 03:07:30.440]  all music and everything and then it was like okay well we're going to give music back but
[03:07:30.440 --> 03:07:36.840]  but no no no alex jones no you know like i said i i can't even go into the warehouse you know
[03:07:36.840 --> 03:07:41.080]  there's a couple of the guys out here that agree with me and i have the same philosophy you know
[03:07:41.080 --> 03:07:47.640]  listen to you ever now and then but you even even bring it up in the office or anything or they
[03:07:47.640 --> 03:07:53.640]  mentioned it or you're always the crazy you're it it's funny how you know the stuff the democrats
[03:07:53.640 --> 03:07:58.600]  and the left is doing like being pedophiles and all that you know that's all fixed in with them
[03:07:58.600 --> 03:08:04.360]  they always try to throw that on you and everything else like they say it's you and it's ridiculous
[03:08:04.360 --> 03:08:11.480]  really well it just shows how once you push censorship and tell people that's how you get
[03:08:11.480 --> 03:08:17.240]  ahead and once facebook says you can only say things negative about alex jones all these managers
[03:08:17.240 --> 03:08:26.600]  and social climbers go well if i just start censoring people i will uh get promoted but

[03:09:58.200 --> 03:10:12.360]  mracken takes over okay um well that last episode that last section with joey gibson
[03:10:12.360 --> 03:10:20.600]  was really pretty mind-blowing the idea that a an ordinary citizen journalist can make that a kind
[03:10:20.600 --> 03:10:27.880]  of high impact video that he produced is just it's really mind-blowing to me and i think that this is
[03:10:27.880 --> 03:10:33.560]  a big part of the reason why the the mainstream media is panicking and i think that it's a big
[03:10:33.560 --> 03:10:40.680]  part of the reason for their censorship you know they're even censoring stories now on censorship
[03:10:40.680 --> 03:10:49.080]  and in this hour um if he's if he's uh set up i have a filmmaker named michael hanson on uh to
[03:10:49.080 --> 03:10:57.080]  to uh uh share with me today his experiences with his own independent filmmaking and how big tech
[03:10:57.080 --> 03:11:03.960]  has been moving to just absolutely crush him and and uh destroy the ability of people to watch his
[03:11:03.960 --> 03:11:13.880]  films um michael hanson produced a film in in 2017 called killing europe he's an american of danish
[03:11:13.880 --> 03:11:20.280]  descent uh born in denmark but lived most of his life here and he went back to europe and
[03:11:20.920 --> 03:11:28.920]  he dug deep into both the european antifa movement and their allies in the islamic
[03:11:28.920 --> 03:11:36.600]  refugee movement and the europeans that that both promote antifa and this islamic uh
[03:11:37.880 --> 03:11:45.640]  hijra kind of a takeover invasion a stealth invasion and this video which exposed really
[03:11:45.640 --> 03:11:53.880]  shocking things uh eyewitness testimony by by gang rape victims etc the video itself now has
[03:11:53.880 --> 03:12:01.560]  been taken off of amazon so a couple weeks ago bright bart did a story on the film killing europe
[03:12:01.560 --> 03:12:08.680]  and his new film called killing free speech which is coming out and i guess that the the publicity
[03:12:08.680 --> 03:12:16.760]  that this gained him uh caused the the leftists in the in the so-called red green alliance
[03:12:16.760 --> 03:12:25.160]  this is the alliance of the communist antifas and the islamic uh and the islamic so-called refugees
[03:12:25.800 --> 03:12:34.040]  that are taking over in europe and increasingly in the united states they went to amazon had the film
[03:12:34.040 --> 03:12:41.320]  you know uh declared you know islamic phobic or whatever and the next thing you know it's not
[03:12:41.320 --> 03:12:47.720]  available for sale on amazon it still is available on vimeo but it's it's becoming increasingly
[03:12:47.720 --> 03:12:53.880]  difficult and they'll probably uh push it off of that too now there's nothing in this film
[03:12:53.880 --> 03:13:00.840]  that's obscene that's that's uh violent you know other than just films right right from the street
[03:13:01.640 --> 03:13:07.960]  yet the film because it is an effective expose has been removed from at for sale from amazon
[03:13:07.960 --> 03:13:13.880]  and this kid hits pretty close to home because a lot of us depend on amazon right i mean it is the
[03:13:13.880 --> 03:13:22.120]  world's biggest marketplace now by far um is uh michael hanson set up to go do we have michael
[03:13:24.280 --> 03:13:31.320]  yeah um let's uh let's bring michael on and um you know without um my taking his time this week
[03:13:31.320 --> 03:13:38.280]  we can talk about his his um upbringing with antifa both in europe and america and uh how he
[03:13:38.280 --> 03:13:43.800]  turned against it and what he can tell us now about you know this threat to our republic
[03:13:44.520 --> 03:13:51.560]  michael are you there let's go yeah i'm here how's it going man yeah good thanks yeah it's um
[03:13:51.560 --> 03:13:57.640]  a little bit a little bit awkward doing this um you know skype to skype but um but we'll get through
[03:13:57.640 --> 03:14:04.040]  it yeah let's let's um talk about what happened um over the last couple weeks with breitbart and amazon
[03:14:05.960 --> 03:14:13.320]  all right so um you know i recently released a movie killing three speech and uh part one at least
[03:14:13.320 --> 03:14:21.080]  and uh breitbart did a story on it they actually did three stories and uh what happened was that
[03:14:21.080 --> 03:14:28.600]  they they linked to my amazon account as well because you know they they mentioned killing europe
[03:14:29.480 --> 03:14:36.200]  and lo and behold you know i think about three or four days later i don't know how long it actually
[03:14:36.200 --> 03:14:41.080]  went but i get an email from somebody saying hey where can we see the extended version of killing
[03:14:41.080 --> 03:14:45.640]  europe and i'm like well you can see it on amazon and he's like no i can't and then i went in there
[03:14:45.640 --> 03:14:53.000]  and sure enough they took it off um citing uh what was it they were what was the term something about
[03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:59.560]  iterating for their customers i guess well i guess what it really means is is that somebody important
[03:14:59.560 --> 03:15:05.160]  or a lot of people called in and and complained because they said it was based off of customer
[03:15:05.160 --> 03:15:11.880]  rating and yet the customer rating or satisfaction was five out of five stars but i guess i don't know
[03:15:11.880 --> 03:15:15.720]  i guess something else when what's happening behind the scenes i have my suspicions huh who
[03:15:15.720 --> 03:15:22.200]  probably said that emotion but um so how long was how long was killing michael how long was
[03:15:22.200 --> 03:15:28.440]  killing europe available on amazon before um the breitbart article came out on killing free speech
[03:15:29.400 --> 03:15:36.120]  well it was available for two years and uh and it was made available right after right after
[03:15:36.120 --> 03:15:43.640]  it had aired on one american news so i mean it's just funny how after two years all of a sudden
[03:15:44.200 --> 03:15:51.240]  you know they find out that this doesn't quite adhere to their codes um i said multiple emails

[03:19:56.520 --> 03:20:01.640]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:20:01.640 --> 03:20:27.080]  you are the one they call president you are not the president
[03:20:27.080 --> 03:20:33.080]  no one who leads so many could possibly kneel so quickly i'm the man they're protecting
[03:20:34.680 --> 03:20:44.520]  i'm the president
[03:20:44.520 --> 03:21:07.320]  okay folks we're back i'll tell you um you know trump he's not the perfect president
[03:21:07.880 --> 03:21:13.480]  but i he's a fighter and i don't know anybody else that's been as effective at trolling the
[03:21:13.480 --> 03:21:21.240]  left and causing them to really expose their their true nature certainly a mit romney uh
[03:21:21.240 --> 03:21:27.480]  john mccain they just forget along to get along types go along to get along and that's
[03:21:27.480 --> 03:21:35.240]  not what we need now we need disruptors and we are certainly entering an era of of completely
[03:21:35.240 --> 03:21:43.080]  independent journalism and that's why it's so important to keep channels like info wars operating
[03:21:43.080 --> 03:21:50.760]  because as we've seen in china eventually the censorship net is just going to choke us out
[03:21:51.320 --> 03:21:57.720]  we see them fighting in hong kong on the streets the least we can do is fight with your computer
[03:21:57.720 --> 03:22:06.040]  mouse or with your smartphone and keep the message going to keep the message going it means supporting
[03:22:06.040 --> 03:22:13.000]  the info wars store obviously it also means supporting independent journalists you know uh
[03:22:13.000 --> 03:22:19.000]  like joey gibson that we saw in hong kong they've all everybody's got a patreon or a subscribe
[03:22:19.000 --> 03:22:25.480]  star if you want to fight from your home this is how you do it um you know in the case of
[03:22:25.480 --> 03:22:33.640]  michael hanson it's almost like getting back to ussr sami's dot self-publishing days you couldn't
[03:22:33.640 --> 03:22:39.720]  find uh gulag archipelago in russia you had to really search it out you had to copy it you had to
[03:22:39.720 --> 03:22:45.880]  pass the books hand to hand and that's what we're getting down to today so michael hanson's films
[03:22:45.880 --> 03:22:53.560]  for now it's still available in vimeo but he's also setting up a website to sell dvds i was talking
[03:22:53.560 --> 03:22:57.560]  to him about it he said yeah you know old people they're still into dvds i said it's not just old
[03:22:57.560 --> 03:23:04.440]  people it's people that want to get the message because it's being suppressed so getting the
[03:23:04.440 --> 03:23:10.680]  physical dvd is you know maybe you just can't find the video on the internet anymore killing europe
[03:23:10.680 --> 03:23:17.080]  or coming up killing free speech or in the case of my books yes they're available as ebooks and
[03:23:17.080 --> 03:23:23.960]  they're available on audible but nobody can delete an actual printed book so you get the dvd in your
[03:23:23.960 --> 03:23:30.120]  in your hands you'll be able to hand it out to friends co-workers and keep the message going
[03:23:30.120 --> 03:23:35.720]  okay michael um let's get back on topic uh we're talking about the suppression of your films
[03:23:37.240 --> 03:23:43.240]  yeah so i mean it basically left off with uh amazon shutting it down after two years and
[03:23:43.800 --> 03:23:49.880]  i don't think it's a coincidence because bright bar just did three articles on killing free speech
[03:23:49.880 --> 03:23:58.280]  part one which i just released to uh to the public on youtube and uh they linked to killing europe on
[03:23:58.280 --> 03:24:03.720]  amazon and i really think that's what got it shut down all of a sudden it's getting high traffic
[03:24:03.720 --> 03:24:09.640]  and it's getting getting noticed and obviously anybody who who appears on bright bar will get
[03:24:09.640 --> 03:24:17.720]  the attention of the left um and and and you gotta remember that it's not the first time the left
[03:24:17.720 --> 03:24:23.400]  left has noticed my films because killing free speech i did actually a private screening with
[03:24:23.400 --> 03:24:30.120]  board patrol back in october or was it november and uh after that screening i don't know how
[03:24:30.120 --> 03:24:36.360]  like some left-wing reporter got a hold of it and she basically came out with a bunch of articles
[03:24:36.360 --> 03:24:41.320]  came out uh from different left-wing media sites saying that board patrol was posting a white
[03:24:41.320 --> 03:24:48.120]  supremacist documentary blah blah blah blah which we all know you know that's just there falsely was
[03:24:48.120 --> 03:24:52.280]  but you know it puts a much pressure on board patrol they were supposed to have several screens
[03:24:52.920 --> 03:24:58.760]  in the texas chapter as well but the ads like cancel all of that and uh and not only that the
[03:24:58.760 --> 03:25:05.320]  board patrol the union rep told me that even the democrats that were being endorsed by the board
[03:25:05.320 --> 03:25:11.160]  patrol were receiving a lot of heat because they had indoors so to speak my movie by having these
[03:25:11.160 --> 03:25:19.000]  this private screening so i think that as soon as the left then saw saw this on bright board they
[03:25:19.000 --> 03:25:24.680]  went all right well you know we can't really shut down a movie called killing free speech because
[03:25:24.680 --> 03:25:30.280]  that would be i guess a little bit too much out front but let's try and hit killing europe because
[03:25:30.280 --> 03:25:35.880]  i personally think that if they can basically ban my movie killing europe everywhere it's going to be
[03:25:35.880 --> 03:25:40.840]  that much easier for them than to go after killing three speech afterwards if that makes sense i mean
[03:25:40.840 --> 03:25:46.040]  i'm just you know what once once once once it's once they make it a fate of complete that once
[03:25:46.040 --> 03:25:52.360]  they've once they accomplish the goal of branding one of your films as you know some kind of uh
[03:25:52.360 --> 03:25:59.240]  white hate hate speech um which obviously it's not then they'll just be able to say anything by you
[03:25:59.240 --> 03:26:05.400]  who goes right into the forbidden section anything so you'll you'll be tarred completely up up down
[03:26:05.400 --> 03:26:10.440]  in sideways was which one of your films was prevented for being shown in a library in canada
[03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:17.960]  tell us about that was that was killing europe so back story to that is is that you know i'm
[03:26:17.960 --> 03:26:24.440]  i'm from denmark and when i did killing europe two years ago i wanted to to show killing europe
[03:26:24.440 --> 03:26:30.760]  in denmark that's where i wanted to premiere but uh needless to say after contacting a few venues
[03:26:30.760 --> 03:26:35.720]  they all said no thank you because they were afraid of radical muslims and they were afraid of antifa
[03:26:35.720 --> 03:26:40.200]  and which you know i mean just proves the point because killing europe is not only about immigration
[03:26:40.200 --> 03:26:45.560]  it's about how media is suppressing all the news about the effects of mass immigration so it's
[03:26:45.560 --> 03:26:51.880]  kind of ironic but you know so denmark was out of the question so we figured all right well what's
[03:26:51.880 --> 03:26:58.600]  the most harmless place you almost never ever hear about well canada so we figured that would be a
[03:26:58.600 --> 03:27:04.120]  safe place to have a screening right nobody's gonna even bother about what the hell goes on in canada
[03:27:04.120 --> 03:27:12.760]  usually so no offense to canada but but um but sure enough they had the screen set up antifa
[03:27:12.760 --> 03:27:17.080]  got involved as soon as they found out about it and they complained to the library initially the
[03:27:17.080 --> 03:27:23.000]  library said because they have a big movie theater in ottawa they said this is not hate speech uh we
[03:27:23.000 --> 03:27:28.360]  have free speech and they have a right to have to show the film in our theater and then the police
[03:27:28.360 --> 03:27:33.800]  the ottawa police even viewed the film and said this is not violent canadian hate speech laws
[03:27:33.800 --> 03:27:40.760]  it's a go but then some local politicians all of a sudden got involved tim tirney to be precise
[03:27:40.760 --> 03:27:46.920]  and this all happened after uh so-called human rights lawyer called richa warman who is based on
[03:27:46.920 --> 03:27:53.960]  this serial human rights lawsuit guy like he uses the human rights court superior must go after anybody
[03:27:53.960 --> 03:27:59.080]  if you're from canada and you're into politics you know who richa warman is he's like some some
[03:27:59.080 --> 03:28:03.160]  he's like the i don't know here in the united states i'm sure you got to the southern poverty
[03:28:03.160 --> 03:28:10.840]  law center like sbl soon yeah i don't know if they do also but oh kind of like they're actually
[03:28:10.840 --> 03:28:15.880]  they're the ones who practice uh law fair uh we'll get back to care but the point is is that
[03:28:16.600 --> 03:28:23.320]  after they got involved it got shut down and then we got um we're going to a break in a little bit
[03:28:23.320 --> 03:28:29.960]  i'm gonna pull it back to um to um transition you know i'm gonna when we come back i'm gonna compare
[03:28:29.960 --> 03:28:37.160]  this in a way to the tommy robinson situation where the people who are trying to highlight and showcase
[03:28:37.160 --> 03:28:42.600]  the abuses of girls the trafficking the gang raping they're the ones who are called haters and have
[03:28:42.600 --> 03:28:47.720]  their have their material banned we'll be back after the break and take it up again with michael

[03:30:42.840 --> 03:30:47.560]  being used by god this is providence so i salute you and i thank you for all you've done from the
[03:30:47.560 --> 03:30:55.720]  bottom of my heart info wars the most banned network in the world before i started working at info
[03:30:55.720 --> 03:31:01.640]  wars i was not only a fan of alex jones and info wars dot com but also the products at info wars
[03:31:01.640 --> 03:31:07.400]  store.com and there's one product that's offered at info wars store.com that is the elite of the
[03:31:07.400 --> 03:31:12.040]  supplements and that's dna force plus now i remember when alex first started talking about this with
[03:31:12.040 --> 03:31:18.040]  some of his special guests telomeres and telomere support with your dna and so i started to look
[03:31:18.040 --> 03:31:24.680]  into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you
[03:31:24.680 --> 03:31:30.520]  protect your telomere so i started looking into dna force plus but it's expensive why because it is
[03:31:30.520 --> 03:31:35.800]  an elite supplement and then i started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive
[03:31:35.800 --> 03:31:42.760]  supplements for telomere support and they came and they went but dna force plus is still there it
[03:31:42.760 --> 03:31:47.960]  is the elite supplement i get excited when dna force plus is on sale because i know it's expensive
[03:31:47.960 --> 03:31:55.640]  so you should take advantage of 50 off dna force plus at infowarstore.com it's not only that you
[03:31:55.640 --> 03:31:59.880]  have a unique voice in the public arena in the public square the other thing that's unique about
[03:31:59.880 --> 03:32:05.640]  info wars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate
[03:32:05.640 --> 03:32:10.040]  sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's not being funded by secrets foreign
[03:32:10.040 --> 03:32:15.640]  government it is completely independent of all that it is an old school american 1776 style
[03:32:15.640 --> 03:32:19.800]  experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the
[03:32:19.800 --> 03:32:23.960]  founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country they actually tried to support and
[03:32:23.960 --> 03:32:28.280]  subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted and then
[03:32:28.280 --> 03:32:32.440]  ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or
[03:32:32.440 --> 03:32:37.000]  billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views the
[03:32:37.000 --> 03:32:41.720]  person's allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through that
[03:32:41.720 --> 03:32:46.040]  the uh that they are the bridge from the of founding to the modern age ultimate american
[03:32:46.040 --> 03:32:50.600]  democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming
[03:32:50.600 --> 03:33:04.200]  defamation lawfare and libel targeting youth you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:33:04.200 --> 03:33:23.000]  wage in war on corruption it's alex jones with matt bracken
[03:33:27.320 --> 03:33:32.680]  okay i'm back with uh michael hansen and we're talking about well we were going to be talking
[03:33:32.680 --> 03:33:41.400]  about antifa and the red-green alliance but it it seems like the message is so dangerous to
[03:33:42.360 --> 03:33:50.200]  to the big tech mainstream media the globalists that they won't even allow the subject to be
[03:33:50.200 --> 03:33:56.840]  discussed and they certainly won't allow a film about it to be distributed and that's the case where
[03:33:56.840 --> 03:34:04.200]  where killing for your killing europe has been taken down by amazon uh links go bad it's it's
[03:34:04.200 --> 03:34:10.840]  very difficult becomes difficult to find and this is the process of deplatforming and unpersoning
[03:34:11.560 --> 03:34:18.280]  somebody who is fighting for freedom across the world you nation to nation and i would almost
[03:34:18.280 --> 03:34:26.280]  i would almost compare this situation to um tommy robinson who made his bones highlighting the you
[03:34:26.280 --> 03:34:33.480]  know the uh not only rutherham that was the most famous case but across the uk tens of thousands
[03:34:33.480 --> 03:34:42.040]  of english and and uh british girls being being groomed traffic and gangribbed and somebody like
[03:34:42.040 --> 03:34:48.280]  tommy robinson who highlights this and how the british police were essentially part of the cover
[03:34:48.280 --> 03:34:54.920]  up the british police would arrest the parents who tried to go find and rescue their girls the
[03:34:54.920 --> 03:35:01.640]  parents would be arrested while the rapists would be let free or not even bothered you know the
[03:35:01.640 --> 03:35:08.760]  complaint would be against the parents for harassing the the poor rapists literally and it took a
[03:35:08.760 --> 03:35:15.720]  tomney robinson to expose this and look what happened to him now he's back in prison you know
[03:35:15.720 --> 03:35:21.880]  michael hansons not in prison but here he is a filmmaker takes his own equipment goes out
[03:35:22.520 --> 03:35:28.200]  creates and produces these these really epic films and as soon as they start getting any
[03:35:28.200 --> 03:35:35.320]  notice or traction they're crushed and it's it's very discouraging but um you know we're talking
[03:35:35.320 --> 03:35:41.320]  today about how we can fight back i'm sorry michael i get passionate about this um uh
[03:35:41.960 --> 03:35:47.800]  where do we go from here well i mean it's uh i just wanted to wrap up with the amazon thing
[03:35:47.800 --> 03:35:52.120]  i mean canada's canada they even tried to bring a human rights complaint against me that's
[03:35:52.760 --> 03:35:59.080]  but uh anyways but my thing was that i i understood canada's basically turning into europe like this
[03:35:59.080 --> 03:36:06.520]  obelian control society but i always thought of us as like the beacon of freedom we have we have
[03:36:06.520 --> 03:36:11.240]  free speech first amendment protections but then this happens after the bright part articles but
[03:36:11.880 --> 03:36:17.880]  what i don't know if i think i told you right man not i told you that um after bright part
[03:36:17.880 --> 03:36:24.840]  writes the article about how anison took the to killing europe down they put a link to killing
[03:36:24.840 --> 03:36:30.520]  europe on youtube and a couple of days after they did that a bunch of people did the same thing they
[03:36:30.520 --> 03:36:35.560]  put links and wrote articles about it right now if you click on any links that talks about
[03:36:35.560 --> 03:36:40.680]  danie spillmaker killing europe taken down from amazon and you go in there you want to watch
[03:36:40.680 --> 03:36:45.240]  the killing europe youtube link you'll see that it's been removed because it violated content
[03:36:46.840 --> 03:36:52.600]  two days later after m uh bright parts article about the amazon takedown youtube goes in now
[03:36:52.600 --> 03:36:58.280]  and take down killing europe no figure you know free speech is not really that much free anymore
[03:36:58.280 --> 03:37:04.520]  here in america and uh i want to go back to it ties into the reason why they're doing it i really
[03:37:04.520 --> 03:37:11.160]  think it's because of the movie i made killing killing free speech part one um because you know
[03:37:11.160 --> 03:37:16.520]  as soon as they get as soon as they get get killing europe completely banned everywhere
[03:37:16.520 --> 03:37:21.480]  you know it only takes one strike to then knock me off on youtube you get what i'm saying and i
[03:37:21.480 --> 03:37:25.560]  think ultimately that's what they want to do they want to kill off this killing free speech
[03:37:25.560 --> 03:37:30.360]  before the next election basically because there's a key killing free speech part two coming out in
[03:37:30.360 --> 03:37:39.400]  october and and and this is part of a pattern obviously um you know i i think that i think that
[03:37:39.400 --> 03:37:46.840]  it's i call this like a full spectrum operation and before you become famous enough to say you know
[03:37:46.840 --> 03:37:54.120]  be on get on fox news uh they want to just crush you and tar you to the point where say a fox news
[03:37:54.120 --> 03:38:01.000]  would never touch you because you'll be in a icky band you know uh hate speech category and you'll
[03:38:01.000 --> 03:38:07.160]  be considered too hot for um for fox and this is something that i want to give i want to give props
[03:38:07.160 --> 03:38:13.240]  to um one american news network because they did have the guts to run killing europe last year i saw
[03:38:13.240 --> 03:38:20.200]  it there several times they played it several times and uh lately like in the last week one american
[03:38:20.200 --> 03:38:28.600]  news network is is suing um the daily beast and msnbc because they were they were doing sort of the
[03:38:28.600 --> 03:38:34.840]  same thing against one american news they were saying that one american news is a russian operation
[03:38:34.840 --> 03:38:40.760]  you know that that it's um uses russian reporters or you know that it's a putin operation and
[03:38:40.760 --> 03:38:47.560]  and this is a way of of putting one american news outside of you know the respectable mainstream
[03:38:47.560 --> 03:38:53.160]  media so anything that you see on one american news is supposed to be branded as unreliable
[03:38:53.160 --> 03:38:59.640]  you know just russian propaganda and in the same way anything by michael hansen is going to be called
[03:38:59.640 --> 03:39:06.680]  you know hate speech like his his band killing europe movie and it's so ironic because killing europe
[03:39:06.680 --> 03:39:12.440]  is about well it's about who is killing europe now but if you can't understand what's going on you
[03:39:12.440 --> 03:39:18.440]  can't save europe this would be like a filmmaker in the 1930s who's banned from writing about the
[03:39:18.440 --> 03:39:25.800]  nazi party because it hurts germans feelings and you you show a concentration camp and they say
[03:39:25.800 --> 03:39:31.000]  that's propaganda you're making the germans feel bad and you're and we're not going to allow your
[03:39:31.000 --> 03:39:37.000]  film to be shown i mean at least at least in that era we were allowed to you know to shine a light
[03:39:37.000 --> 03:39:42.360]  on what was happening in europe uh but today no with it the enemy is coming in and we're not even
[03:39:42.360 --> 03:39:49.720]  allowed to show it well what what's just surprises me is is that that this is happening here in american
[03:39:49.720 --> 03:39:55.400]  now i really never thought this was going to happen here and in many ways you know killing europe
[03:39:55.400 --> 03:40:01.480]  was was a warning to united states you know i mean it's like you know you don't want to be like europe
[03:40:01.480 --> 03:40:06.120]  listen take it from somebody from denmark you don't want to be denmark you don't want to be europe
[03:40:06.120 --> 03:40:12.680]  because no matter what bernie sanders and all these other people from the democratic party tells you
[03:40:12.680 --> 03:40:19.080]  europe is really falling apart and i mean killing europe is a testimony to that you know i'm not some
[03:40:19.080 --> 03:40:25.640]  paid filmmaker i'm not like more i'm not anybody i i went back to literally the streets where i grew
[03:40:25.640 --> 03:40:31.640]  up and i went all over europe this is what this is my home and and people can't tell me that that's
[03:40:31.640 --> 03:40:37.400]  hate speech reporting what's going on in my home you know what i mean yeah but but and we we can
[03:40:38.440 --> 03:40:43.320]  you know we can see that it's it's a coordinated effort because you know when you have patriots
[03:40:43.320 --> 03:40:50.440]  they want to any any european capital try to just have a meeting antifa will rush them and the police
[03:40:50.440 --> 03:40:55.720]  will basically escort the antifa in and then use the water cannons against the patriots
[03:40:56.760 --> 03:41:06.120]  and the live live video live live the patriots the the patriots will be getting the water cannons
[03:41:06.120 --> 03:41:12.120]  while the antifas are escorted in we see this over and over again or we see that the german television
[03:41:12.120 --> 03:41:18.920]  state television had reporters probably also you know intel operatives on these these this
[03:41:18.920 --> 03:41:25.320]  seawatch three ship that was bringing the um the african refugees to italy this is all part of a
[03:41:25.320 --> 03:41:31.640]  german program i mean this is official german state tv working hand in glove with the human
[03:41:31.640 --> 03:41:38.200]  traffickers so if we elect somebody like a you know from the left in this country it's not only
[03:41:38.200 --> 03:41:45.000]  going to be open borders it's going to be escorting in the train loads what i'd like to say is is that
[03:41:45.000 --> 03:41:51.800]  united states is about 15 20 years behind europe in many aspects um going back to antifa i i've
[03:41:51.800 --> 03:41:56.280]  explained to people over and over again that antifa is doing the dirty work that the european
[03:41:56.280 --> 03:42:02.360]  governments can't do because they still have some kind of rights in europe right but um so but they're
[03:42:02.360 --> 03:42:07.960]  paid indirectly by by the local city councils that are dominated by left through there i told you
[03:42:07.960 --> 03:42:12.600]  on the last show through these community houses and what i have you know and they're getting funded
[03:42:12.600 --> 03:42:16.760]  over here they're funded by geosaurus i think that's an obvious fact but what i want to point out is
[03:42:16.760 --> 03:42:22.360]  this i mean look at the sanctuary cities where everybody has sanctuary except for conservancies
[03:42:22.360 --> 03:42:27.720]  right look at um i mean at these protests where people where the police get a stand down order
[03:42:27.720 --> 03:42:32.040]  the only reason why they're getting that stand out order is so i antifa can do what they do
[03:42:32.840 --> 03:42:37.000]  you know intimidate people to stay away from anything that looks like and will give the
[03:42:37.000 --> 03:42:42.200]  perception that there's actually people against this like like portland port portland is the
[03:42:42.200 --> 03:42:46.840]  pattern for the future portland is europe and portland is the future when we come back we're
[03:42:46.840 --> 03:42:52.360]  going to talk more about antifa and what we can do to fight uh fight this growing terrorism from the
[03:42:52.360 --> 03:42:57.640]  left robert march what does big tech become a big tech are big babies that have become big bullies
[03:42:57.640 --> 03:43:02.040]  and the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social economic political or legal
[03:43:02.040 --> 03:43:06.440]  for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why the courts the judges
[03:43:06.440 --> 03:43:10.280]  the juries the members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary members
[03:43:10.280 --> 03:43:14.440]  of the public and the audience that care about this have to bring real social political economic
[03:43:14.440 --> 03:43:18.280]  consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change and they will become the
[03:43:18.280 --> 03:43:22.840]  big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran american politics and
[03:43:22.840 --> 03:43:26.840]  ran american economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the great
[03:43:26.840 --> 03:43:32.280]  depression the inforores audience is the fuel that flames the the light of liberty across the world
[03:43:32.280 --> 03:43:36.840]  to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real the original promise of
[03:43:36.840 --> 03:43:41.400]  an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with
[03:43:41.400 --> 03:43:45.160]  each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts and then the
[03:43:45.160 --> 03:43:49.320]  whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate form of gas lighting
[03:43:49.320 --> 03:43:55.320]  what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what you just saw serving with inforores

[03:45:03.160 --> 03:45:07.400]  censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits the rest of it i would talk about how great the products
[03:45:07.400 --> 03:45:11.160]  are and how they were the best and why they were and i'd have doctors on an experts to explain why
[03:45:11.160 --> 03:45:15.320]  they were so good and instead the last few years i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll
[03:45:15.320 --> 03:45:18.440]  shut us down the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are
[03:45:18.440 --> 03:45:23.400]  and how wonderful they work and the left always has headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved
[03:45:23.400 --> 03:45:29.800]  supplements that he claims are supplements no under federal law since 1996 you can't say that a
[03:45:29.800 --> 03:45:33.800]  supplement has been through the fda because they have no jurisdiction it won't look at it but then
[03:45:33.800 --> 03:45:38.200]  they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying to
[03:45:38.200 --> 03:45:42.040]  tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs work
[03:45:42.040 --> 03:45:46.120]  great they have side effects not with mother nature but big pharma doesn't want you knowing

[03:47:26.920 --> 03:47:33.400]  okay i'm back with michael hansen for the last uh segment you know this this is really a a full
[03:47:33.400 --> 03:47:41.400]  spectrum operation to censor conservatives libertarians people on people on the right freedom
[03:47:41.400 --> 03:47:49.400]  oriented people at the top you can see it with you know with google and youtube facebook that's
[03:47:49.400 --> 03:47:55.320]  the tech that's the tech wing then you've got left wing governments fortunately uh we have
[03:47:55.320 --> 03:48:00.840]  president trump but across europe they're working hand in glove with google to censor what their own
[03:48:00.840 --> 03:48:07.080]  people can see and then you get down to the municipal level where where you'll see left
[03:48:07.080 --> 03:48:13.000]  wing mayors and city councils giving police essentially stand down orders allowing their
[03:48:13.000 --> 03:48:20.520]  local antifuzz to be the the street thug arm so that conservatives are set are basically afraid to
[03:48:20.520 --> 03:48:27.080]  come out and show their show their colors show their flag so it gives the it can be portrayed on
[03:48:27.080 --> 03:48:33.000]  television that only the left wing ever comes out they must be the only ones that care now you can see
[03:48:33.000 --> 03:48:38.680]  that this is this is false because when trump has a rally you know 15 or 20 000 people will pack an
[03:48:38.680 --> 03:48:45.080]  arena but if it if it's a if it's a rally downtown in an open park people are literally afraid
[03:48:45.080 --> 03:48:50.360]  because they know that the antifuzz can smash them on that with a bicycle lock while the police are
[03:48:50.360 --> 03:48:57.480]  nowhere to be found and this is something that uh that both michael's uh both of michael hanson's films
[03:48:57.480 --> 03:49:02.920]  killing europe and killing free speech have dealt with and michael hanson has a lot of experience
[03:49:02.920 --> 03:49:10.120]  with us uh embedding with antifa um it is youth and and as a filmmaker and i'm not sure if we
[03:49:10.120 --> 03:49:16.040]  have any of these uh video clips of michael i'm ready to roll but um michael can you talk some
[03:49:16.040 --> 03:49:22.200]  about um you know how you first brushed up against antifa and and what you're thinking about it now
[03:49:23.400 --> 03:49:29.800]  yeah i mean my initial experience with antifa came when i was in my mid teens because i played in
[03:49:29.800 --> 03:49:35.800]  a punk band and i was in the whole punk rock environment back in coban agon and and a lot
[03:49:35.800 --> 03:49:42.680]  of these venues that are funded by these local the left wing municipalities they uh they are kind of
[03:49:42.680 --> 03:49:48.600]  like the the recruiting ground for antifa so you know i kind of got sucked into that whole scene
[03:49:48.600 --> 03:49:53.880]  because i was stupid i was a teenager and i thought hey i'm rock right and and i brought a little
[03:49:53.880 --> 03:49:59.480]  i found this up in the attic uh this is like a picture of me back when i was 17 and stupid
[03:49:59.480 --> 03:50:04.920]  let's put it like that um i keep it as a souvenir of how dumb you can be and that kind of proves to
[03:50:04.920 --> 03:50:10.840]  me that probably most of the antifuzz is just some teenagers like i was right but i very quickly
[03:50:10.840 --> 03:50:15.480]  found out that wait a minute this is not really that cool so i very quickly left that scene and
[03:50:15.480 --> 03:50:20.920]  maybe tony the danish army kind of put me back on the right track but we have a we have a i think
[03:50:20.920 --> 03:50:26.280]  we have i think we have a segment you know that's that's me as a young young guy i think we have a
[03:50:26.280 --> 03:50:34.440]  segment from uh from uh killing free speech um is that ready to roll let's go with that
[03:50:34.440 --> 03:50:36.440]  we can't
[03:50:40.440 --> 03:50:46.520]  the infamous black walk just showed up and they all got the same uh snazzy helmets and all that
[03:50:47.800 --> 03:50:50.440]  i feel like i'm back in europe let's see where this goes
[03:50:51.880 --> 03:50:56.920]  in spite of the heavy presence of antifa the mainstream media was calling these groups simply
[03:50:56.920 --> 03:51:02.280]  counter protesters on the other hand they were calling the conservatives far right this is the
[03:51:02.280 --> 03:51:09.000]  same narrative in rhetoric being driven by the left we want a world free from white supremacy free
[03:51:09.000 --> 03:51:15.880]  from racism and xenophobia and we think that believing in these things is what makes you an
[03:51:15.880 --> 03:51:22.920]  antifascist but where the left is right did i really ride in a bus full of fascists and is rally
[03:51:22.920 --> 03:51:28.440]  organized at joe gibson a neo nazi and a white supremacist i was really confused because joe
[03:51:28.440 --> 03:51:33.240]  gibson is of japanese descent so i decided to take a closer look at this rally
[03:51:33.240 --> 03:51:52.840]  this was indeed a multicultural crowd and yet they were being labeled as white supremacists
[03:51:52.840 --> 03:52:03.640]  a good peaceful time uh hopefully they stay peaceful and uh i'm not even really paying attention to them really so much i'm just a little bit just don't turn into white supremacists
[03:52:06.200 --> 03:52:11.480]  how do you view these guys as uh nazi's fascists white nationalists white nationalists
[03:52:13.080 --> 03:52:17.160]  what about what about the people who are not white in there what do you what do you say though
[03:52:17.160 --> 03:52:26.040]  say to that how do you explain that one oh man no
[03:52:28.520 --> 03:52:36.280]  yeah so michael hanson go ahead no i was just going to say this is that that's that's what i
[03:52:36.280 --> 03:52:41.640]  learned when i was a teenager when i was inside of anti-fives you want to call it that is is that
[03:52:41.640 --> 03:52:48.600]  there are parts of hypocrites i mean there and the point is is that they just they'll they'll call
[03:52:48.600 --> 03:52:54.600]  anybody of races and a nazi because then that legitimately legitimizes their their violence
[03:52:54.600 --> 03:52:59.880]  and it's like what's happening is that since the 90s till now and also in the united states this is that
[03:52:59.880 --> 03:53:05.560]  this fan of who's a nazi is now everybody if you're not like Bernie sander supporter or a
[03:53:05.560 --> 03:53:10.680]  nano kiss or antifa you're a nazi and that's the whole point is is that a lot of these african
[03:53:10.680 --> 03:53:15.560]  americans i was talking to there's one guy i was talking to a people standing across the street yelling
[03:53:15.560 --> 03:53:22.280]  calling him a nazi and stuff i'm like seriously it's just but they keep on pushing that narrative
[03:53:22.280 --> 03:53:27.240]  and the clip also explains this is that mainstream media they could they they they carry on that
[03:53:27.240 --> 03:53:32.440]  narrative that that these so-called the antifa groups and communist groups they always label
[03:53:32.440 --> 03:53:38.120]  them anti-racist anti-fascists because you know if they're anti-fascists and they are
[03:53:38.120 --> 03:53:42.520]  protesting they must be protesting fascists right so the mainstream media is part of that
[03:53:42.520 --> 03:53:48.840]  problem they're like the speaking whatever of of antifa you can say yeah and i i just saw that um
[03:53:49.720 --> 03:53:56.920]  the Breitbart editor Raheem Kasem he they don't the the tour the labor party in Australia don't
[03:53:56.920 --> 03:54:02.200]  want to give him a visa to visit Australia they automatically call this guy because he's a Breitbart
[03:54:02.200 --> 03:54:10.200]  editor a far right wing extremist so anybody who is not antifa is a racist you know far white
[03:54:10.200 --> 03:54:15.960]  extremist even if you're not a white guy like Raheem Kasem you know i think he's an ex-muslim
[03:54:15.960 --> 03:54:23.240]  they still have to to just call him a far right extremist the the left can't win the debate all
[03:54:23.240 --> 03:54:29.320]  they can do is shut down the debate and and what they use now increasingly is what is what's called
[03:54:29.320 --> 03:54:36.040]  the heckler's veto where if you're just trying to have a venue to have a have a a patriotic rally
[03:54:36.920 --> 03:54:43.400]  they'll make threats and then the police will ban the rally because the communists the antifas
[03:54:43.400 --> 03:54:48.760]  are threatening violence so and it's successful because many of these of these cities they have
[03:54:48.760 --> 03:54:54.040]  left-wing mayors that are essentially behind the scenes they're working hand in glove with the
[03:54:54.040 --> 03:55:00.760]  antifa and you know hopefully they just have wrecked this misuse of a language so bad that being
[03:55:00.760 --> 03:55:05.560]  called a right-wing extremist it's good and or even a racist it's going to lose its bite
[03:55:07.000 --> 03:55:11.480]  exactly but i i just want to bring the point that um and this is ultimately the point of
[03:55:11.480 --> 03:55:16.040]  killing free speech is is that you know and what's happened with killing free speech and
[03:55:16.040 --> 03:55:21.480]  killing Europe these past few weeks just confirms you know what i'm trying to prove in this movie
[03:55:21.480 --> 03:55:28.200]  and um it is is that United States you're a lot closer to going down the same path as Europe than
[03:55:28.200 --> 03:55:33.480]  that anybody could ever imagine you're one election away really because think about it if you you're
[03:55:33.480 --> 03:55:38.440]  next president if that next president is Bernie Sanders or any of these people you know Portland
[03:55:38.440 --> 03:55:43.560]  is going to become the rest of the United States and uh and it's like and i really think to bring
[03:55:43.560 --> 03:55:48.920]  it back to you know what this whole discussion about banning on my films uh i want to encourage

[03:56:54.520 --> 03:56:59.160]  but what's ironic is is that i'm now going to incorporate the censorship of killing free
[03:56:59.160 --> 03:57:05.800]  speech and killing europe in my movie that you know it is kind of ironic and the thing is is that um

[03:57:43.320 --> 03:57:49.880]  last night i'm on info wars dot com and i read chris pratt criticized for t-shirt choice it is
[03:57:49.880 --> 03:57:55.480]  literally the shirt that i envisioned a betsy ross but also another just classic american flag all
[03:57:55.480 --> 03:58:01.880]  50 stars with the gadson snake super imposed over and on the back america's back info wars dot
[03:58:01.880 --> 03:58:06.120]  com but what's better than just an american flag about a don't tread on me under the flag take don't
[03:58:06.120 --> 03:58:09.480]  trail the american flag it's a perfect combo so great minds think alike i mean whoever designed
[03:58:09.480 --> 03:58:14.920]  that shirt we'd already come up with the exact same similar design it is the don't tread on me american
[03:58:14.920 --> 03:58:20.760]  flag t-shirt inspired by the triggering of leftist of the shirt worn by chris pratt let it say you
[03:58:20.760 --> 03:58:25.320]  know battle tattered flag like the one that flew over for something and again on the back it says
[03:58:25.320 --> 03:58:31.960]  america's back info wars dot com four thousand of these babies and that's it so we've got the
[03:58:31.960 --> 03:58:37.800]  betsy ross version and the american flag version at info wars store dot com be printed in the usa
[03:58:37.800 --> 03:58:42.360]  right now info wars store dot com they'll be right back the most banned broadcast in the world
[03:58:45.160 --> 03:58:50.520]  what you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the western
[03:58:50.520 --> 03:58:59.720]  world history this is a digital ai enforced gag order not to say the name alex jones or
[03:58:59.720 --> 03:59:11.080]  info wars dot com this is nazi germany level this is racketeering this is cartels mr president
[03:59:11.080 --> 03:59:19.480]  we need your help we need it now you can take on victek they saw info wars as a dominant independent
[03:59:19.480 --> 03:59:26.520]  anti-war pro human pro sovereign pro family populist organization so they thought first they come
[03:59:26.520 --> 03:59:33.160]  for alex jones then when people say okay take him off the air everyone else like dominoes would fall
[03:59:33.160 --> 03:59:38.760]  the way to fight back is to support info wars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom
[03:59:38.760 --> 03:59:43.400]  and free speech understand that they believe they can take us down they'll take everybody else down
[03:59:43.400 --> 03:59:49.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show
