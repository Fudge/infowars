[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:23.360]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones it is October 4th
[00:23.360 --> 00:29.760]  2009 on this Sunday edition we're gonna be live here for the next two hours thank you
[00:29.760 --> 00:35.600]  so much for joining us another very informative information packed radio broadcast
[00:35.600 --> 00:41.760]  TV show today we are summer casting both hours of this Sunday transmission right now
[00:41.760 --> 00:50.720]  not just on the radio but also via full living color at prisonplanet.tv so I want to thank
[00:50.720 --> 00:59.680]  everyone for joining us today well I'm fresh back from hardened Montana I had to go and I tell
[00:59.680 --> 01:05.600]  you we were not disappointed the bizarreness was off the chart it gives new meaning to the term
[01:05.600 --> 01:16.640]  truth is stranger than fiction a 14-time felon with warrants out across the country tied in with
[01:16.640 --> 01:24.400]  multiple defense contractor organizations and groups shows up and takes over without even
[01:24.400 --> 01:33.200]  filing paperwork a 27 million dollar camp prison detention center in the tiny town of
[01:36.160 --> 01:40.000]  hardened Montana then there's the question of why are they building detention centers
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.680]  in the middle of nowhere why do we have more people in our prisons than any other country in the
[01:45.680 --> 01:51.520]  world I'm going to be speaking to that as well today so I went to be on the ground to investigate
[01:51.520 --> 01:57.200]  what was really happening there and I will be detailing that coming up later in this first
[01:57.200 --> 02:02.640]  hour we're also going to open the phones up and continue the discussion of the open announcements
[02:02.640 --> 02:08.400]  by media that the dollar is on the chopping block right now and what it means to the United States
[02:08.400 --> 02:15.920]  if the dollar is killed so that is coming up this evening as well I want to get into a large
[02:15.920 --> 02:25.040]  stack of other police state news here today and how it all ties together like mothers in the UK
[02:25.040 --> 02:32.960]  and in England I mean not just in England but all over the UK Ireland Scotland you name it
[02:33.680 --> 02:40.640]  and here in the United States being told that you can't maybe sit your neighbors kids for even five
[02:40.640 --> 02:49.840]  minutes free association is over this is the control grid and how that ties together with
[02:49.840 --> 02:57.120]  15 million dollar fines for garage sales if you sell anything that's on the recall list
[02:57.120 --> 03:02.960]  tens of thousands of different items as if you're supposed to know and how that ties together with
[03:02.960 --> 03:12.800]  Barack Obama saying he wants a year-round school as if it's the federal government's job well it
[03:12.800 --> 03:18.960]  is though that's how they've set it up they've ended basically the 10th amendment in this country
[03:18.960 --> 03:27.040]  and you'll notice whatever's being announced here is being announced in the UK the British Isles
[03:27.040 --> 03:33.520]  and in Australia and in New Zealand and in Canada and in Europe Western Europe because the same
[03:33.520 --> 03:39.040]  social planners are setting up the system our governments are run lock stock and barrel by
[03:39.040 --> 03:43.040]  offshore interest and will not just break down the fact that they're controlling our society
[03:43.040 --> 03:51.360]  illegitimately but what their goals and agendas are so that is coming up today a lot of new
[03:51.360 --> 03:58.080]  fear mongering on the CO2 I saw Bill Maher this morning when I was exercising on HBO and he was
[03:58.080 --> 04:02.640]  saying the same thing we're all dead carbon dioxide's a deadly poison it will kill you
[04:02.640 --> 04:07.680]  that matter of plants breathe it they're now seeing that carbon oxides will quote turn the ocean into
[04:07.680 --> 04:16.320]  acid that matter of most of what the oceans made up of is CO2 they would have picked oxygen but
[04:16.320 --> 04:23.440]  they know too many people know oxygen's good so they're they're choosing salt because it's scientific
[04:23.440 --> 04:30.560]  name sodium chloride sounds scary and they're selecting carbon dioxide because its name
[04:31.680 --> 04:37.840]  sounds scary they also debated choosing water dihydrogen monoxide saying it was a deadly poison
[04:37.840 --> 04:43.120]  because that is a scary name but they knew that people would find out it meant water I think
[04:43.120 --> 04:48.640]  dihydrogen monoxide is scarier than carbon dioxide but they chose that so that's the key
[04:48.640 --> 04:54.880]  building block of life they planned it to tax it's all coming up today stay with us important
[04:54.880 --> 05:02.800]  transmission have you heard that millionaire entrepreneur businessman your congressional

[06:04.400 --> 06:20.320]  enemy lines the information war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[06:21.360 --> 06:30.800]  well cbs news nbc news abc news nationally cnn all picked it up on wednesday thursday and friday
[06:30.800 --> 06:38.160]  day i had figured out by sunday of last week uh now seven days ago that this was an important
[06:38.160 --> 06:43.600]  story so i uh decided to go tuesday got on an airplane wednesday morning wednesday afternoon
[06:43.600 --> 06:49.920]  and flew out uh to billings montana from there i drove to the little town of three and a half
[06:49.920 --> 06:58.800]  thousand people hardened montana that borders the crow indian nation reservation what am i talking
[06:58.800 --> 07:06.960]  about american police force a shadowy group run by 14 time convicted serb national felon
[07:08.480 --> 07:12.480]  who goes his latest alias no one really knows his real name
[07:12.480 --> 07:16.720]  just has all these convictions and warrants nationwide seriously no one knows that the
[07:16.720 --> 07:22.480]  guy's real name uh he just has the convictions and prison time under different names for grand theft
[07:22.480 --> 07:30.640]  you name it uh is captain michael hilton and he showed up in a police uniform with black suv's
[07:30.640 --> 07:36.960]  black uh mercedes suv's with the hardened police on the side didn't matter if that was illegal
[07:36.960 --> 07:43.520]  impersonating a police officer was illegal because he was in with the local boss hogs and they were
[07:43.520 --> 07:50.480]  going to take over the giant 27 million dollar fema camp uh it was being looked at a year ago
[07:50.480 --> 07:56.640]  to hold guantanamo detainees but now they were looking at just basically holding locals this
[07:56.640 --> 08:03.280]  is the new economic development in our country is prisons and surveillance and control and the
[08:03.280 --> 08:09.920]  locals that is the local constabulary thought that it was completely normal to have a foreign
[08:09.920 --> 08:14.640]  felon running things and i talked to some of the locals this week when i was there and they said
[08:14.640 --> 08:20.320]  hey we don't care if he's a felon we don't care let him run the the the prison and you know basically
[08:20.320 --> 08:26.320]  let him feed on locals and put everybody in the jail i mean what's 450 beds bare minimum that
[08:26.320 --> 08:34.880]  facility had 450 beds of a town of 3500 i guess in texas texas is the capital of prisons worldwide
[08:34.880 --> 08:40.960]  we've got over 10 percent of texas with uh warrants out for their arrests now so why not
[08:40.960 --> 08:47.120]  why not put everybody in prison hell put half of us in prison the other half will run things i mean
[08:47.120 --> 08:53.920]  that is the new world order plan but the issue here isn't just that you have this felon this
[08:53.920 --> 09:01.040]  mercenary tied in with all these other shadowy groups doing this it's that when we first reported
[09:01.040 --> 09:06.640]  this last week people didn't believe us now it's on the national news and uh
[09:06.640 --> 09:14.240]  uh the billings gazette was very very fair and said that we were right that he was a felon
[09:14.240 --> 09:19.840]  and a criminal and it was all a big fraud in the scam the local paper said we love him we love the
[09:19.840 --> 09:25.600]  captain and i talked to locals they admitted that he struts around in a police uniform and drives
[09:25.600 --> 09:30.640]  around in police vehicles and that they were about to do a contract to have his private group
[09:30.640 --> 09:39.440]  arresting people and putting them in the prison now the majority of the locals i talked to on the
[09:39.440 --> 09:44.560]  ground said look they want to put us in this prison for petty reasons and to finis and fias
[09:44.560 --> 09:49.360]  and this is a big moneymaker for the locals that run this town but when i would go into the shops
[09:49.360 --> 09:53.760]  in the sheriff's department and the in the economic development zone they call it the
[09:53.760 --> 10:00.400]  port authority the two rivers group when i would talk to their people they just loved it and they
[10:00.400 --> 10:06.000]  said it's no big deal to have a felon with warrants out for his arrest running the the the jail
[10:06.720 --> 10:12.240]  and yes we do want to plan mercenaries there train them there and we do plan to do that and yes
[10:13.200 --> 10:18.800]  all of this is going on all of this is happening and yes we're going to put people from all over
[10:18.800 --> 10:23.280]  the county big horn county in the prison and yes it's going to make us money what's wrong with that
[10:24.960 --> 10:29.920]  and it wasn't just that the that the leadership of the town was so immoral by and large and i talked
[10:29.920 --> 10:39.040]  to scores of them that wasn't the big issue i mean that's bad enough it was that even after
[10:39.040 --> 10:45.280]  i explained to them that he wasn't making the payments of the 2.6 million dollars he's supposed
[10:45.280 --> 10:51.760]  to pay a year to run the private prison and when i pointed out that his backers were pulling out
[10:52.480 --> 10:56.960]  and that all these different defense contractors said it was a fraud and they weren't involved
[10:56.960 --> 11:01.600]  they would just shake their head and say no it's real we haven't been conned by the captain
[11:03.200 --> 11:07.920]  and it reminded me of the american people i mean this was a microcosm of everything that's
[11:07.920 --> 11:12.720]  happening in this country the american people don't want to admit that foreign banks have taken
[11:12.720 --> 11:17.920]  over the nation through fraud through deceit and are bankrupting us by designed to vertically
[11:17.920 --> 11:22.880]  integrate our society to consolidate our society and bring in a police state that they own and
[11:22.880 --> 11:29.840]  manage and control this this is corporate looting by and large people don't want to admit that they
[11:29.840 --> 11:39.520]  have been conned and so this captain michael hilton one of 17 aliases cbs news now reports
[11:39.520 --> 11:47.200]  nationally this captain michael hilton now now mind you once it came out that these were aliases
[11:47.200 --> 11:52.880]  he was fake he was a fraud he was a liar he wanted to feed on the locals and basically throw
[11:52.880 --> 12:00.720]  everybody in prison there's cbs news national news american police force corporation takes over
[12:00.720 --> 12:10.400]  small town police force and prisonerless jail see that's cbs he reported this on monday people
[12:10.400 --> 12:16.720]  laughed at us but that's why i went there to document it but this is a microcosm of our
[12:16.720 --> 12:30.320]  nation because locally in a town in southern montana a guy blows in with police cars painted up to
[12:30.320 --> 12:39.440]  say harden and everybody just falls down and worships him and it's the same thing in texas
[12:39.440 --> 12:44.240]  cnn's made a lot of hay out of this they always expose the little local corruption to make themselves
[12:44.240 --> 12:51.120]  look good they never cover the real high-level corruption we do both that's what separates
[12:51.120 --> 12:55.840]  us from the mainstream media but you hear about the texas towns right outside austin they've got
[12:55.840 --> 13:01.200]  them where they just pull all ladies over young men black men white men they don't care and they
[13:01.200 --> 13:05.280]  say i'm going to take the 500 out of your wallet i'm going to take your watch and if you don't
[13:05.280 --> 13:09.440]  like it i'm going to charge you with narcotics trafficking i signed this piece of paper saying
[13:09.440 --> 13:13.680]  you've agreed on me to take this now of course it's fraud you can't under duress make somebody
[13:13.680 --> 13:20.640]  sign something but these crooks don't care now what do you think happens in some tiny town of 150
[13:20.640 --> 13:29.680]  people you will get a local county commissioner who lives there and he'll get together with his
[13:29.680 --> 13:37.680]  brother or his cousins and they'll pass a resolution they'll they'll they'll get the local town the
[13:37.680 --> 13:41.760]  locals in the little town that didn't even incorporated to go get incorporated with the state
[13:41.760 --> 13:47.440]  they'll fill out some paperwork they just get some police cars and drive out and start robbing people
[13:47.440 --> 13:52.800]  it's real simple so that's the same thing in harden i found out they have a very corrupt
[13:52.800 --> 13:58.000]  sheriff's department classically corrupt feeding on the public it's the same deal and by the way
[13:58.000 --> 14:04.160]  the sheriff's department said they love it they love the captain and the locals again the the
[14:04.160 --> 14:08.320]  entire boss hog leadership we even had them run out of stores and push on us and scream
[14:08.320 --> 14:13.280]  on us and yell at us now again the majority of locals supported us and we had fans everywhere
[14:13.280 --> 14:17.520]  and i was getting stopped on every street corner but then you'd have boss hogs come out of their
[14:17.520 --> 14:23.680]  shops you know anybody who has a pot to you know what in they see themselves as the leadest
[14:23.680 --> 14:28.000]  and that's how this whole system works nationwide they would run out and shove on my
[14:28.000 --> 14:31.440]  cameraman and tell us we weren't allowed to be on main street and get the hell out of our town
[14:31.440 --> 14:36.000]  you firing Yankees basically and i would say to him okay let's say i'm a dirty Yankee from
[14:36.000 --> 14:40.720]  texas i'm a carpet wagon scally wagon your business i would say this to him i got this on video
[14:40.720 --> 14:47.840]  and i would say but it's okay to have a guy from Montenegro Balkans over in Serbia
[14:48.800 --> 14:54.080]  who's a felon over here and they said hell yeah we like him we're gonna make money i mean they
[14:54.080 --> 15:01.200]  were on power trips in front of me looking because of this two rivers authority this economic
[15:01.200 --> 15:08.400]  development authority with all these different city council people and people running for mayor
[15:08.400 --> 15:12.480]  and their husbands and you know you'd have the lady running for mayor whose husband was on the
[15:12.480 --> 15:17.760]  board of the two rivers authority and he ran out of the shadows at us on main street and pushed
[15:17.760 --> 15:23.120]  Aaron we've got that on video i mean it's the twilight zone and it's the same thing all over
[15:23.120 --> 15:31.200]  the country from skinakki new york uh to oakland california it's just mafia they put on uniforms
[15:31.200 --> 15:36.240]  you fall down and worship them so why not have some con artists show up in a police uniform take
[15:36.240 --> 15:41.680]  over a FEMA camp and say he's gonna put the locals in it and of course the boss hogs locally love
[15:41.680 --> 15:46.960]  it they said hell yeah we're really gonna rule now i'm gonna make me some money off the locals
[15:46.960 --> 15:51.120]  i'm gonna be the boss because all the local constabulary we're gonna be boss hogs in the
[15:51.120 --> 15:57.920]  new prison that could hold roughly 20 of the town they love it and that's what's bringing america

[20:04.080 --> 20:12.000]  you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network
[20:17.600 --> 20:24.640]  so if you just joined me i went to hard montana to witness the decline of our nation
[20:25.760 --> 20:30.480]  and really i was looking in a mirror i was looking back at myself we can laugh at those
[20:30.480 --> 20:36.720]  montanans wanting to be conned by charlatan wanting to have foreign mercenaries come in
[20:36.720 --> 20:44.480]  in black Mercedes and and with with german enforcers with some guy from Serbia saying they
[20:44.480 --> 20:51.440]  were going to police and run the town and and fill the local prison as an economic development
[20:51.440 --> 20:56.720]  but you look at my own state of texas the united states has more prisoners than any other country
[20:56.720 --> 21:03.760]  in the world china has a billion and a half people or right at it uh india has one billion one hundred
[21:03.760 --> 21:16.320]  million the united states has twice the prisoners china does twice and texas has more than any other
[21:16.320 --> 21:21.920]  country in europe texas has more prisoners than france france with 80 million people
[21:21.920 --> 21:28.320]  that's right texas has more prisoners than england and they're not going to stop they're
[21:28.320 --> 21:33.920]  going to hire more police you every little tiny town's got lines of police cars and they now admit
[21:33.920 --> 21:37.760]  they just pull you over and grab the money right out of your wallet the dallas police just throw
[21:37.760 --> 21:42.960]  bags of chalk in your car they take it they don't care government is rogue and criminal
[21:43.840 --> 21:50.240]  and the sooner people figure this out the better and that's all the city is i mean why not have
[21:50.240 --> 21:55.360]  some foreign con artists with german troops in tow shaking everybody down in harden
[21:57.040 --> 22:02.560]  and announcing he's taking over the detention fema center why not i mean it's the same thing
[22:02.560 --> 22:09.120]  to have locals doing it it's the exact same thing that we live through in this society
[22:09.920 --> 22:15.760]  and it is only going to get worse until we as a society begin to wake up to what is happening
[22:15.760 --> 22:22.880]  and so when i talk about harden montana being a microcosm it's not just a microcosm of
[22:23.760 --> 22:28.800]  other towns around the united states where you drive through texas you drive through alabama
[22:28.800 --> 22:33.200]  you drive through new york you drive through illinois you drive through minnesota you drive
[22:33.200 --> 22:40.080]  through arizona i mean i've been all over not as much as the johnny cash song i've been everywhere
[22:40.080 --> 22:45.360]  man i've been everywhere but i've had a lot of places and i've been to canada and i've been to
[22:45.360 --> 22:50.720]  latin america and i've been to europe and you don't see prisons like we got anywhere it's rare
[22:50.720 --> 22:56.080]  to see a prison in europe it's rare to see one in mexico and if you do they're hellacious and you
[22:56.080 --> 23:01.200]  don't want to go back and boy their police are corrupt down there too all i'm asking people to
[23:01.200 --> 23:08.960]  do is to get this mind controlled image of the police and government is some heroic wonderful
[23:08.960 --> 23:15.440]  perfect pure as the driven snow thing we've got to fall down and worship to what it really is
[23:15.440 --> 23:20.320]  something super dangerous yeah you got to have some government but you better keep it within
[23:20.320 --> 23:26.960]  the bill of rights and constitution you better keep it very small and starving what do george
[23:26.960 --> 23:31.840]  washington say i know he's a bad guy nowadays but i will quote him i know fema demonizes
[23:31.840 --> 23:38.240]  him to citizens in different training seminars he said that government like fire is a dangerous
[23:38.240 --> 23:44.400]  servant just look if you're using fire for fire breaks or using using fire to cook food or
[23:44.400 --> 23:52.800]  you're using fire to you know uh in a blacksmith forge fire is a dangerous servant don't play
[23:52.800 --> 24:03.920]  with matches but but the finish is quote fire is a dangerous servant and a fearful fearful means
[24:03.920 --> 24:10.400]  whoo man man we're talking you can get the hackles up get scared fire is a dangerous
[24:10.400 --> 24:17.280]  servant a fearful master hitler was government whole pot was government Stalin linen mal
[24:17.920 --> 24:24.560]  fiddle castro all these other thugs in 95 98 99 depending on what period of history
[24:25.200 --> 24:30.880]  percent of the time government is murdering and stealing and enslaving you take zimbabwe
[24:30.880 --> 24:36.960]  and their leader over there they killed almost every white person in the country stole their
[24:36.960 --> 24:41.520]  property around them out but he'd already set up that system of government kind of the liberals
[24:41.520 --> 24:46.320]  the last 20 years in the u.s and england said go ahead and kill whites they're evil they own
[24:46.320 --> 24:53.600]  farms they deserved it the whole society collapsed and now the murder rates even higher as blacks
[24:53.600 --> 25:00.080]  kill blacks they kill anybody that's got anything and so nobody can feed themselves and there's no
[25:00.080 --> 25:04.800]  jobs starvation has been rampant for five six years hundreds of thousands have died
[25:07.120 --> 25:11.840]  that's called government corruption you know oh there was a rationale they're white let's go ahead
[25:11.840 --> 25:18.240]  and kill them and it's like yeah you know kill whitey same thing in south africa to a lesser
[25:18.240 --> 25:24.160]  extent it's it's now falling apart record crime rate in the world after zimbabwe same thing in
[25:24.160 --> 25:30.480]  north korea look at government there hellish government with some four foot nine goblin
[25:31.120 --> 25:36.480]  who's got a seven-story pleasure palace and routinely hijacks japanese and south korean
[25:36.480 --> 25:44.640]  airlines with a secret police on board stalking asian film stars he wants to rape i mean we got
[25:44.640 --> 25:52.480]  a guy hijacking planes with women he wants i mean this is government me a guy in a uniform
[25:52.480 --> 25:58.240]  four foot nine high high jack and jets for women he wants to rape now am i supposed to just oh he's
[25:58.240 --> 26:03.120]  such a hero he's wearing a uniform i love kim jong il i mean i'm supposed to bow down to
[26:03.120 --> 26:08.560]  saddam who's saying because he's in a uniform people are like monkeys in this country and they're
[26:08.560 --> 26:13.920]  like this worldwide they see a uniform in a fancy hat where do you think crowns came from that was a
[26:13.920 --> 26:19.200]  headdress people make fun of ignorant savages around the world that are wearing headdresses and stuff
[26:19.200 --> 26:24.560]  well what do you think they do in england you get some old murderous woman with her murderous family
[26:24.560 --> 26:29.280]  committing all these crimes worldwide everybody worships her she's got a big glistening headdress
[26:29.280 --> 26:34.960]  with diamonds on it and our presidents get down and kiss her on the hand and kiss her butt this
[26:34.960 --> 26:39.600]  is a woman who has a groom of the stool she doesn't even wipe her own hind end you don't believe me
[26:39.600 --> 26:45.040]  google that term that's right she has a white gloved butler that does it and when obama sees
[26:45.040 --> 26:51.920]  a saudi royal or he sees a british royal or bush does they bow down to him because their family were
[26:51.920 --> 26:58.080]  kingpins mobsters who got so much power they got armies under them and they started wearing fancy
[26:58.080 --> 27:05.040]  headdresses and oh my gosh we all love badges so that's why the queen wears dozens of badges all over
[27:05.040 --> 27:12.080]  festooned with badges pull up a british royal in in in an official dress just just festooned with
[27:12.080 --> 27:18.080]  badges and so why not have a con artist show up with mercenaries in a montana town and start
[27:18.080 --> 27:24.320]  policing people why not have them just show up a cbs news is reporting and start ruling everyone
[27:24.320 --> 27:29.280]  because america let me tell you that the locals saw that badge they hit their faces in the dirt
[27:29.280 --> 27:36.160]  because we are a trained country of cowards now i want to get our freedom back i want to get our
[27:36.160 --> 27:43.200]  country was founded on hating crowns and hating badges our first presidents wouldn't allow themselves
[27:43.200 --> 27:49.680]  to have fancy titles andrew jackson many presidents later wouldn't allow it they didn't dress fancy
[27:49.680 --> 27:56.080]  they weren't into being fancy they weren't into badges they were into being strong and honorable
[27:56.080 --> 28:02.960]  and creating things and inventing things and trailblazing not on wearing bling yeah i don't
[28:02.960 --> 28:09.040]  like bling when somebody's got a big gold grill in their teeth okay and i don't like it when queen
[28:09.040 --> 28:16.000]  elizabeth the second runs around with all her badges and all her diamonds and her crown saying
[28:16.000 --> 28:23.280]  i'm better than you you know i don't like india i don't like india the fact that they have the cast
[28:23.280 --> 28:27.440]  system and wear the little symbol in their head saying everybody else beneath me you know in the
[28:27.440 --> 28:34.400]  indian society is dirt i don't bow down to somebody because they're wearing a crown or a badge or a
[28:34.400 --> 28:39.280]  or a or got a dot between their eyes saying that everybody else in india scum but them
[28:40.800 --> 28:46.160]  or it's another form of a badge obama's black so it's the reverse now you're not allowed to
[28:46.160 --> 28:51.520]  criticize him because he's got dark skin now i'll do whatever i want i'm sick of everything being

[33:08.960 --> 33:23.200]  i'm going to open the phones up the toll free number to join us is 888-201-2244 888-201-2244
[33:23.200 --> 33:31.680]  locally in central texas you're a news radio 590 k lbj listeners 512-646-1776 can i apologize i know
[33:32.400 --> 33:38.080]  1776 refers to our evil founding fathers you think i'm joking in the upcoming film fall of
[33:38.080 --> 33:43.840]  republic i have the government's own training videos and documents teaching that the founding
[33:43.840 --> 33:51.360]  fathers are bad because we have a rogue criminal government now let me get into some of the other
[33:51.360 --> 33:56.960]  news later in the week i'm putting together a video report of the footage we shot in hard
[33:56.960 --> 34:01.360]  montana and i'll talk more about it and it's coming out every day that the attorney general
[34:01.360 --> 34:08.480]  is now hunting the head of american police force wanting to talk with him and serve him
[34:09.680 --> 34:16.000]  and that there are arrest warrants out for him so we told you something was going on in hard
[34:16.000 --> 34:23.040]  montana so there'll be more on that as it develops but when i said it was a microcosm it's a
[34:23.040 --> 34:28.880]  microcosm in that all across the united states you roll into small towns the middle of nowhere i
[34:28.880 --> 34:36.320]  mean i challenge people here in texas to just drive around anywhere but texas is the worst but
[34:36.320 --> 34:40.560]  all over the country it's bad and you'll be driving through the middle of nowhere corn fields
[34:41.280 --> 34:47.840]  wheat fields cotton fields forest and you'll see small towns and then you'll see prisons
[34:48.400 --> 34:53.200]  and detention centers and county detention centers you'll have counties in texas that might have
[34:53.200 --> 35:00.400]  15 000 people in them and they'll have some 200 400 500 bed facility harden in the whole county
[35:00.400 --> 35:07.760]  there's only 14 000 people uh in harden itself three and a half thousand very rural community in
[35:07.760 --> 35:16.240]  montana and they had a jail built the taxpayers of course get to pay for it for 450 beds i mean
[35:16.240 --> 35:24.560]  that's enough to serve a town of 100 000 people but not in america not in america in fact if you
[35:24.560 --> 35:31.040]  look at prison numbers you go back to new york city 150 years ago well over 100 000 people living
[35:31.040 --> 35:37.120]  there they had a much smaller jail than harden does why didn't we need those jails back then
[35:37.680 --> 35:42.400]  why would a town of 100 000 people need a jail for maybe 30 or 40
[35:42.400 --> 35:51.040]  million but now it needs a jail for 5 000 10 000 and a town of three and a half thousand needs a
[35:51.040 --> 35:57.920]  jail for 450 because ladies and gentlemen they have changed the laws and rewritten the system
[35:58.560 --> 36:03.440]  where violent offenders are released very quickly whereas in the old days you weren't
[36:05.120 --> 36:10.240]  and real criminals are released quickly con artists frauds they're released quickly
[36:10.240 --> 36:17.760]  this guy's got a rap sheet of this captain hilton made up you know name made up show up in a police
[36:17.760 --> 36:24.080]  uniform locals bow down because they've been trained about of the crown to to to i mean it's like in
[36:24.080 --> 36:29.440]  raiders the lost ark which is fiction but it's a good analogy when they've he just stole them the
[36:29.440 --> 36:35.120]  golden idol and the bad guy holds it up to the natives and they all bow down you know that's
[36:35.120 --> 36:40.800]  same thing with americans i mean you hold up a badge they just bow we've been trained to be slaves
[36:43.120 --> 36:51.200]  but but this is our economy now in this society that's what most of the new scholarships are in
[36:51.200 --> 36:58.160]  colleges itt technical is an itt technical anymore when you go to newspapers and magazines
[36:58.160 --> 37:03.680]  the most prominent ads you see next to drug ads next to prozac ads for the drugged out public
[37:03.680 --> 37:11.440]  our ads to become a security officer to become a police officer to join the cia to join the fb i
[37:11.440 --> 37:17.840]  all of that's growing while the rest of our economy dies and this is a conscious decision
[37:17.840 --> 37:22.640]  by groups controlling the government to vertically integrate the economy into a police state
[37:23.840 --> 37:29.440]  and then private groups are privatizing all these major prisons and you've got
[37:29.440 --> 37:38.480]  scic and other big pentagon groups that are private that do more spying than the 15 government spy
[37:38.480 --> 37:47.200]  agencies there's 15 major agencies defense intelligence naval intelligence cia nsa list goes
[37:47.200 --> 37:55.840]  on and on the press reports that upwards of 70 percent of the funding now goes to private groups
[37:55.840 --> 38:03.760]  and they're spying on you locally and it's all illegal it's all and i don't care if they say
[38:03.760 --> 38:06.960]  it's legal it violates the bill of rights and constitution it's criminal
[38:09.760 --> 38:14.880]  and so that's the type of atmosphere where for the last few months you could have foreigners
[38:14.880 --> 38:20.560]  driving around in police cars that weren't even incorporated running police operations and taking
[38:20.560 --> 38:25.760]  over a private prison to put the citizens in as the new economic development it was paid for
[38:25.760 --> 38:34.000]  by the taxpayers as an economic development that's what they're doing that's how they operate
[38:35.840 --> 38:39.360]  now the microcosm doesn't stop there as you drive across the country and
[38:40.080 --> 38:46.320]  all we do is put people in prison it doesn't stop there that's at the local grassroots level
[38:47.600 --> 38:52.160]  it's also a microcosm what's happening in hardmontana the federal reserve the federal
[38:52.160 --> 38:57.360]  reserve shareholders are predominantly european that's on record in the last investigation they
[38:57.360 --> 39:03.120]  had in the 30s on the federal reserve in congress but it's never been audited started in 1913
[39:05.680 --> 39:14.080]  and the private run for profit federal reserve is just like captain michael hilton it's a complete
[39:14.080 --> 39:22.720]  fraud he puts on a police uniform puts government decals on his car starts patrolling starts going
[39:22.720 --> 39:27.280]  to city council as the police chief oh we've now gotten the city council record he's been doing that
[39:29.040 --> 39:36.400]  doesn't matter it's the same thing the private federal reserve came in bought off our congress
[39:36.400 --> 39:41.920]  in 1913 was given the power to issue currency and credit they then used our money and our wealth to
[39:41.920 --> 39:46.320]  buy off the rest of the planet and now they're done with us and they're imploding this nation
[39:46.320 --> 39:52.960]  and i sit here every day like a resident of harden montana saying what is a group of foreign
[39:52.960 --> 39:58.880]  bankers doing coming into town and not just taken over illegitimately but running things into the
[39:58.880 --> 40:09.840]  ground by design it's a fraud but just like in harden the local establishment are on the news
[40:09.840 --> 40:15.360]  news you can just google american police force and watch national news pieces local news pieces you
[40:15.360 --> 40:20.240]  name it to your heart's content they're going so what if he's a felon so what if he's a foreigner
[40:20.240 --> 40:24.960]  so what if he lied about everything we like him we're sticking with him they won't admit they're
[40:24.960 --> 40:31.120]  wrong because they wanted to run the private prison they wanted to have power over people
[40:32.240 --> 40:37.200]  and that's why your local governors and the congress and your legislatures and your local
[40:37.200 --> 40:43.360]  kawanas club and your local rotary club all their leaders get wind and dine by these other elite
[40:43.360 --> 40:49.280]  groups just a pat on the head a bone and they feel like they're part of the power structure and they
[40:49.280 --> 40:56.640]  get off on it just like our presidents get off on being invited to dine with the queen and they'll
[40:56.640 --> 41:02.720]  bow down to her and toast her and her stupid crown because people want to feel like they have power
[41:02.720 --> 41:07.920]  and they don't want to admit they've been conned or bamboozled and that's all that's happened to
[41:07.920 --> 41:14.240]  this nation but there's another microcosm not just the denial it's the fact that you've got this foreign
[41:14.240 --> 41:19.440]  federal reserve engaging in predatory behavior against us and you've got these little jails all
[41:19.440 --> 41:26.480]  over the country engage in predatory activity i mean here is agency french press got another one
[41:26.480 --> 41:36.960]  here from msn us economic decline forages new world order and they say that the us must fall
[41:36.960 --> 41:45.760]  for the world government to be born and they're talking about how great all of this is and if
[41:45.760 --> 41:51.280]  you google the term new world order there are tens of thousands in the news section alone
[41:51.280 --> 41:56.960]  as they all announce the same thing isn't it great the crisis is redrawing the world here's
[41:56.960 --> 42:02.960]  another one world bank welcomes new economic order from the ashes of crisis one and guardian

[47:31.680 --> 47:41.280]  next hour i want to dovetail several big developments that are taking place not just in the us but
[47:41.280 --> 47:48.400]  worldwide together and tie it in with the new prison economy that's going to be privately run
[47:48.400 --> 47:55.120]  mom ordered to stop babysitting friends kids she can't have neighbor kids over even for
[47:55.120 --> 48:01.520]  five minutes for a cup of hot chocolate before they catch the school bus no association no free
[48:01.520 --> 48:07.920]  association in america you're all gonna have cps visits from the port of the wealthy you're gonna
[48:07.920 --> 48:12.880]  have home environmental visits and the public's gonna go along with this because this is the new
[48:12.880 --> 48:19.120]  economy when everybody's kids are part of the new enforcement corps of all of this and that's the
[48:19.120 --> 48:23.760]  only job you can get people are gonna love it it's like the only job you can have in our town is
[48:23.760 --> 48:30.880]  running the prison or being in it see this is the controlled economy and then i've got the same
[48:30.880 --> 48:36.400]  story out of the uk a parents being arrested if they're not allowed to keep neighbors kids
[48:36.400 --> 48:42.240]  hey i'm gonna go to the store can my kids play with your kids you get arrested in michigan and in
[48:42.240 --> 48:49.040]  england this is and by the way two years ago remember in california their court ruled you're
[48:49.040 --> 48:55.200]  not allowed to homeschool your kids unless you have a teaching certificate now they lost it in court
[48:55.200 --> 49:01.040]  later at the federal level but but the point is they're trot folks the government thinks it owns
[49:01.040 --> 49:07.600]  you but that's another issue the same stuff's happening worldwide same manager same system
[49:07.600 --> 49:12.080]  this is the global system it's all admitted it's global but for those of you that won't even
[49:12.080 --> 49:16.320]  research when i'm saying you could at least go look up how this global system operates
[49:18.800 --> 49:23.760]  look at this seller beware feds cracking down on garage sales mclatchy newspapers
[49:23.760 --> 49:29.840]  15 million dollar fine for the second offense hundred thousand dollars for the next there's over
[49:29.840 --> 49:36.720]  10 000 recalled products every year maybe once a year i go to toys or us maybe and you walk in
[49:36.720 --> 49:42.000]  they got a whole wall of recalled toys in a whole thing of little sheets a bunch of clipboards
[49:42.000 --> 49:47.440]  hanging off the wall a whole wall of clipboards as if parents go and read each clipboard no you buy
[49:47.440 --> 49:54.240]  the table you buy the train you buy the you know they said oh the the barbie thing you screw the
[49:54.240 --> 50:00.000]  light bulb into yeah the kid poured water in it stuck their finger in it it could electrocute them
[50:00.000 --> 50:04.720]  yeah so could a light socket you know we're gonna ban roads because the kid could run out in a road
[50:04.720 --> 50:15.040]  and they've arrested people now for those and so you're supposed to know going back over a decade
[50:15.040 --> 50:19.680]  over 10 000 a year that's over a hundred thousand things if you're selling that at your garage sale
[50:19.680 --> 50:24.080]  and they say federal bureaucrats are going to come by they under the homeland security money that
[50:24.080 --> 50:28.400]  every town's going to be getting one of these people or they don't get their highway funds
[50:28.400 --> 50:33.120]  or any federal funds for education so the towns will squeeze you more and the feds will give them
[50:33.120 --> 50:38.400]  10 percent of the money in or 15 percent matching funds and then they come in and oh i'm here to
[50:38.400 --> 50:43.040]  inspect your house i'm here to inspect your garage sale oh this is on the list hundred
[50:43.040 --> 50:47.840]  thousand dollar fine they're writing all of this see i said i'd cover it next time i'm already doing
[50:47.840 --> 50:52.800]  it they're writing all this to get you in the system they didn't build detention centers in
[50:52.800 --> 51:00.800]  little towns for nothing we're going in them i'm going to cover this next time i take calls now
[51:00.800 --> 51:04.960]  into the hour but but so i'm gonna get to at least this board of calls before i get the other news
[51:04.960 --> 51:13.360]  but i'm gonna tell you something i i'm a fair person and i told you that when i flew to la three
[51:13.360 --> 51:17.600]  times in the last few months consulting for jessie ventura's tv show they're developing
[51:18.720 --> 51:26.240]  hold them conspiracy theory that that the austin airport they want the tsa wants my autograph
[51:26.240 --> 51:32.800]  their fans it happened this time when i left god was a fan said he listens to the show every time
[51:32.800 --> 51:38.480]  i go to the tsa in austin different people they're all fans i've had the la people be fans two of
[51:38.480 --> 51:45.040]  the three times i've had the la pd through the checkpoint at a mexican food restaurant at lax
[51:45.040 --> 51:53.520]  come over and shake my hand that's another issue how big this show's gotten i mean how how are we
[51:53.520 --> 51:57.600]  reaching this many people we're not on that many amon FM stations i know we're big on the internet but
[51:58.880 --> 52:05.760]  i was in harden montana and no exaggeration more than half the people on side streets at gas stations
[52:05.760 --> 52:10.880]  up on the highway i had people coming up to us in billings but i mean about half of harden were
[52:10.880 --> 52:18.080]  fans of the show then we had the local boss hogs anybody who had any cousin or anybody in power
[52:18.080 --> 52:22.480]  was just strutting around like they were royalty should have all been wearing crowns they were all
[52:22.480 --> 52:28.720]  violently angry at us but that was the minority a group that rules the town side issue the the
[52:28.720 --> 52:39.120]  point is billings montana in a tsa are absolute thugs i watched them go over some old woman who
[52:39.120 --> 52:46.080]  looked like she was 90 years old in a wheelchair ordering her around they ran our tapes through
[52:46.080 --> 52:54.400]  twice asking what they were they screamed at me over hotel lotion i'm leaving the billings hotel
[52:54.400 --> 53:01.360]  i stayed in harden two days last night in billings so i could catch the flight the next day and i
[53:01.360 --> 53:10.400]  thought oh yeah i'll uh it had a little courtesy bag that i never opened with some lotion and a
[53:10.400 --> 53:15.760]  some breath mint senate and so i threw that in my bag
[53:18.960 --> 53:24.480]  and i thought when i did it i said i bet there'll be a bunch of goons folks they made
[53:24.480 --> 53:29.200]  liquid illegal to make you feel like a prisoner to make you feel like you've done something wrong
[53:29.200 --> 53:35.520]  the feds brag the globalist brag worldwide this is your slave induction training and they're making
[53:35.520 --> 53:41.040]  more and more take your shirt off take your boots off you know uh take your belt off i saw making
[53:41.040 --> 53:46.000]  people that were wearing light sweaters pull them off uh take stuff out of your bag they
[53:46.000 --> 53:51.840]  yelled at me for this tiny thing a lotion got on power trips they had weird fat women and i'm not
[53:51.840 --> 53:55.920]  being mean to fat people i'm a little overweight myself you know just weird fat women in jack
[53:55.920 --> 54:02.800]  loot uniforms going like slitting their eyes with power looking at people in the eyes and just all
[54:02.800 --> 54:10.720]  in like a schizophrenic paranoia um a psychosis of a fear and you're all terrorist and jabbing
[54:10.720 --> 54:16.960]  people and asking questions and what do you think they're going to do with a nation of people that
[54:16.960 --> 54:22.000]  are drinking mercury filled corn syrup taking the vaccines every year literally brain damaged
[54:22.560 --> 54:30.480]  watch tv all day fantasize watching keith or suburban torture people on 24 they have no jobs
[54:30.480 --> 54:39.040]  they have no future the government plan worldwide is to create a prison grid and those of us that
[54:39.040 --> 54:48.160]  produce and think we're going to be prodded like like animals just like you cattle prod a little
[54:48.160 --> 54:54.400]  hot shot zapper cows when you got them in a corral or sheep they're just shocking us and they're
[54:54.400 --> 55:02.880]  the and they're going to hire the adiq drooling morons i mean literal getting off on it you have
[55:02.880 --> 55:08.960]  this you're in trouble and just feeding like just god i'm getting power like like a psychic vampire
[55:08.960 --> 55:14.080]  just i mean literally just demonic women with you know with like you know their eyes are like
[55:14.080 --> 55:21.280]  slit with power just going like like like it was this like something out of fire fox with clenice
[55:21.280 --> 55:25.920]  wood when he sneaks into the soviet union and he's going through the you know the soviet union
[55:25.920 --> 55:31.920]  checkpoint and that's how they're acting i mean but worse than a movie only in america which you have
[55:32.720 --> 55:40.880]  huge obese people and stormtrooper outfits prodding 90 year old women and and and and and and with
[55:40.880 --> 55:48.880]  their eyes sparkling with power trip and then i was trying to go to the bathroom in bellings and
[55:48.880 --> 55:54.240]  two of them were waddling in i was kind of ahead of them a little bit and they got angry that i
[55:54.240 --> 56:00.080]  didn't stop and wait for them and one of them kind of bumped into me and that's what tyranny is
[56:00.080 --> 56:03.680]  they're going to run the arts they're going to run theater they're going to run the culture
[56:03.680 --> 56:08.000]  they're going to run your life they're going to home inspect you and you're going to kiss their
[56:08.000 --> 56:13.920]  butt you're going to lick their boots this is what tyranny is about and and and and it's just like
[56:13.920 --> 56:19.920]  the queen of england likes to wear a ceremonial diamond headdress or or somebody in in you know
[56:19.920 --> 56:26.480]  in the south pacific some some new guinea head hunter they like to wear a fancy headdress that's
[56:26.480 --> 56:31.120]  what america is i noticed there were navy guys got on our airplane back to austin from denver
[56:31.120 --> 56:37.120]  and they were on power trips acting all secretive in their navy whites with badges on i guess they
[56:37.120 --> 56:43.680]  were navy police they were flying first class a scum that pay the taxes we were writing not
[56:43.680 --> 56:50.640]  in first class but the the navy gods the low-level nobodies had little little police badges on and
[56:50.640 --> 56:55.760]  they were in the airport before they got on the plane with us looking around and feeling powerful
[56:55.760 --> 57:03.920]  and it's all about status see the new status is slave milk cows that's us the public the the the
[57:03.920 --> 57:09.120]  the brain damage thugs that enforce for them and then the criminal offshore bankers above them
[57:09.120 --> 57:14.480]  that are carrying out the social engineering and so that's why it's in the news that obama says
[57:14.480 --> 57:18.800]  your kids are going to go to school year-round you're not going to home school you're not going
[57:18.800 --> 57:23.360]  to keep your neighbor's kids for even five minutes without a license and you're going to give you
[57:23.360 --> 57:27.440]  a hundred thousand dollar fine for a garage sale and they're going to pass all and and now they're
[57:27.440 --> 57:32.640]  announcing citizen spies nationwide to spy on everyone in the name of terror but you go to the

[1:06:19.600 --> 1:06:27.520]  public gets robbed and most the time gets killed because the government says we can't steal anymore
[1:06:27.520 --> 1:06:32.160]  we've got to at least leave these people with shirts on their backs unless we work them to death
[1:06:32.160 --> 1:06:40.800]  in slave camps we'll do that and that always happens so i know it's what you want it's what

[1:06:52.880 --> 1:06:59.680]  on tv every night saving some iraqi that's have given birth or saving an iraqi dog humans that
[1:06:59.680 --> 1:07:03.760]  be didn't have been dehumanized so people don't like seeing a kid being saved so they'll show
[1:07:03.760 --> 1:07:11.120]  what one of our troops saving a dog and the individual troops are good men and women many of
[1:07:11.120 --> 1:07:17.920]  them but the mission was built on lies and a fraud and iraq is clearly worse off than it
[1:07:17.920 --> 1:07:23.920]  was before and this was about oil and empire and power just like afghanistan is about opium
[1:07:23.920 --> 1:07:29.040]  you don't think the russians went into afghanistan because they wanted to uh go skiing on some of
[1:07:29.040 --> 1:07:35.760]  the snow tipped mountains do you in the himalayas no uh 80 percent of the world's heroin comes out
[1:07:35.760 --> 1:07:41.600]  of there and that's why the bbc admits the us forces are growing and shipping it out so your
[1:07:41.600 --> 1:07:48.800]  kids can take it yeah it's about the 500 bill 500 billion a year in opium that's why we're there
[1:07:48.800 --> 1:07:55.600]  for the smack and you can feel good and cry at the american flag everything the american flag
[1:07:55.600 --> 1:08:02.640]  symbolizes is being torched see it isn't the flag that's special it's what it symbolizes
[1:08:02.640 --> 1:08:10.880]  but people love being gullible well uh seven years ago they stopped giving the anthrax shot
[1:08:10.880 --> 1:08:14.640]  full of squaling to the troops because so many of them were dying from it oh they're going to give
[1:08:14.640 --> 1:08:18.560]  it to the troops again but i know you don't really care about the troops you just feel like it just
[1:08:18.560 --> 1:08:24.080]  feels good to be a fake sentimentalist so go ahead go ahead tell the troops to take it and more will
[1:08:24.080 --> 1:08:30.560]  die and then you can go to your vfw hall and get drunk and talk about how your your rambo and your
[1:08:30.560 --> 1:08:36.880]  good and and then your your granddaughter can die of a heroin overdose from smack that are corrupt
[1:08:36.880 --> 1:08:45.440]  army helped grow yes they grow the smack i mean i'm just not playing people's games anymore here in
[1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:51.600]  texas around half the county's just rob people and deal drugs and do whatever they want it's the same
[1:08:51.600 --> 1:08:57.840]  thing nationwide the government's too big and it's out of control and it's it's corrupt and some of
[1:08:57.840 --> 1:09:03.120]  you people out there won't admit how screwed up it's gotten all right i'm gonna shut up and take
[1:09:03.120 --> 1:09:08.000]  calls this segment the next then i'm getting into you're not allowed to have neighbors over now without
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:14.160]  government permission and folks you're gonna look tyranny works like this it gets bad and it gets
[1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:18.160]  worse and it gets a little bit worse and then suddenly the bottom falls out and you're living
[1:09:18.160 --> 1:09:26.000]  in communist china but let me tell you a lot of you are so mentally cowardly you will rationalize
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  this and call tyranny good because i'm just i just i've just got children and a wife and i can't
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:38.960]  believe my beloved america is being turned into a complete cesspit and if you can't figure out me
[1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:45.840]  using the example of the troops in afghanistan with i care about our military but i don't
[1:09:45.840 --> 1:09:52.720]  like how it's being used just like hitler said shut up shut up to anybody that said uh i'm not
[1:09:52.720 --> 1:09:59.680]  against the military but i think hitler is bad he's it's that's why you're going down listeners
[1:09:59.680 --> 1:10:03.040]  that's why i'm not talking about our general listeners but new listeners that tune in every
[1:10:03.040 --> 1:10:06.960]  millisecond that's why you're going to lose everything you got because you just you have
[1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:12.160]  this fake image in your mind of something that doesn't exist and never even existed but it
[1:10:12.160 --> 1:10:20.560]  certainly doesn't exist now see once you've bought into the con game once a lot of people get into
[1:10:20.560 --> 1:10:25.840]  ponzi schemes and scams and once they've invested in it the ponzi schemer comes back and says yeah
[1:10:25.840 --> 1:10:29.280]  you can get your hundred thousand back you got to give me another hundred thousand that's the only
[1:10:29.280 --> 1:10:34.880]  way i get you your money back and these people will go and get the money ponzi scammers show up at
[1:10:36.640 --> 1:10:41.920]  their favorite places it at nice country clubs you got well to do retirees with a few million in
[1:10:41.920 --> 1:10:45.840]  the bank that think they're part of the elite they always claim they're a british royal or a
[1:10:45.840 --> 1:10:51.120]  rock a feller or a roth child and they drive up in a fancy Bentley and come and kiss the old women
[1:10:51.120 --> 1:10:55.520]  on the hands and make them feel important and talk about an investment they've got that's so
[1:10:55.520 --> 1:11:01.680]  incredible but no no one can be involved in it then they'll pick one or two people and they'll
[1:11:01.680 --> 1:11:07.760]  go oh yes i invested 20 000 and got 10 000 back the next week then every old lady it's usually
[1:11:07.760 --> 1:11:12.720]  women that go for the scams that's why 80 of advertising targets women mainline advertising
[1:11:12.720 --> 1:11:16.240]  it's just easier to sell women it's not that you're stupid you're just more trusting
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:22.400]  men are just as just as dumb down with stuff the targets then they've gotten better at that but the
[1:11:22.400 --> 1:11:27.360]  point is men used to be more wildly they're actually a lot stupider in many cases now the point is
[1:11:29.040 --> 1:11:36.480]  is they come to them and they say uh oh yeah you saw what mrs johnson just got 10 000 in one week
[1:11:37.520 --> 1:11:41.760]  and so every old woman in the country club goes and shakes down their husband or shakes down their
[1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:47.760]  bank account and they give the guy hundreds of thousands greedily and he skips town and the
[1:11:47.760 --> 1:11:53.200]  old women are always in the news in rhod island or in dallas texas i see the cases every week
[1:11:53.200 --> 1:12:00.880]  going i still believe wilford roth child the ninth is going to give me my million dollars
[1:12:00.880 --> 1:12:08.160]  i believe people calling him corrupt have driven him out of the town wilford i love the drinks we
[1:12:08.160 --> 1:12:13.520]  had together that evening please come back wilford and and i will defend you in coat
[1:12:14.800 --> 1:12:20.320]  and that's how they operate and it was the same thing in in in harden montana with this con
[1:12:20.320 --> 1:12:25.520]  artist dropping out of nowhere taking over the police department driving around in his own vehicles
[1:12:25.520 --> 1:12:32.480]  taking over the prison foreign con artist criminal with foreign troops the public once they went
[1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:36.720]  along with the con they don't care the attorney general tells them it's all criminal and a fraud
[1:12:36.720 --> 1:12:42.880]  and a lie they are even defending it more now they want to be raped they want to be robbed
[1:12:42.880 --> 1:12:48.800]  they want to be scammed they love the government as long as it's in a uniform as long as it's
[1:12:48.800 --> 1:12:55.280]  reading off a teleprompter as long as it's evil they love it that's a diseased nation let's jam
[1:12:55.280 --> 1:13:00.480]  a call in here i'm out of control and i have these computerized phone systems just crash in front of

[1:13:36.560 --> 1:13:41.920]  there there's too much there was listen the majority of the germans denied that hitler

[1:20:16.960 --> 1:20:21.040]  but you know a lot of u.s government officials become knights of the crown in england
[1:20:22.240 --> 1:20:28.800]  you know when you become a peer that you get free houses all sorts of special
[1:20:28.800 --> 1:20:33.520]  perks most of england's owned by the queen of england she walls most the nation off
[1:20:34.720 --> 1:20:39.600]  every time i'm in london they just randomly shut off parts of the city and the and the
[1:20:39.600 --> 1:20:45.040]  buses let you know at the queen's plaza this part of the city is shut down at the queen's
[1:20:45.040 --> 1:20:50.400]  plaza the river is shut down for four hours today and she just does that to exercise her power
[1:20:50.400 --> 1:20:55.280]  in australia when they tried to vote a corrupt government out in 79 the queen fluttered in and
[1:20:55.280 --> 1:21:01.120]  said i'm kicking y'all out that happened last year in canada when they wouldn't go along with
[1:21:01.120 --> 1:21:06.480]  her orders she just said i wasn't last year it was in january of this year look at this
[1:21:06.480 --> 1:21:11.680]  tony blair i wrote an article six years ago saying he was trying to bring england into the
[1:21:11.680 --> 1:21:18.160]  eu without a vote by stealth and now they and i said he would be rewarded by being the head of the
[1:21:18.160 --> 1:21:25.680]  eu the little dictator well here it is tony blair the eu president no one really wants
[1:21:26.400 --> 1:21:34.880]  there he is and by the way france voted it down expanding eu power from almost dictatorship
[1:21:34.880 --> 1:21:42.080]  to total dictatorship showed in ireland well they just kept revoting and now they said friday and
[1:21:42.080 --> 1:21:45.840]  the votes aren't counted yet because they don't have electronic voting machines but it looks like
[1:21:45.840 --> 1:21:52.640]  the libson treaty passes and the british government doesn't care if 85 percent of brits won't go along
[1:21:52.640 --> 1:21:59.280]  with the eu in major polls it's between 75 and 95 depending on the poll i just say 85 it's very
[1:21:59.280 --> 1:22:03.440]  high numbers you can pull them up for yourselves they're just having the bureaucracy do it just
[1:22:03.440 --> 1:22:07.920]  like in the us we're already under the north american union by treaty tony blair the eu
[1:22:07.920 --> 1:22:14.000]  president no one really wants times of london i mean just never get rid of these people let's go

[1:23:03.840 --> 1:23:09.440]  like dvus type uniforms with baseball cap and i thought that was kind of odd and i was just
[1:23:09.440 --> 1:23:13.760]  curious if anyone else had seen something like that yeah i'm looking i'm looking for my article
[1:23:13.760 --> 1:23:19.360]  here here it is marine aircraft causes damage in neighborhood they thought it was a big storm
[1:23:19.360 --> 1:23:23.360]  or even tornado that caused damage to their properties then they realized it was a low
[1:23:23.360 --> 1:23:29.200]  flying military aircraft and it says it happened Tuesday evening on willow street in frankford a
[1:23:29.200 --> 1:23:35.600]  marine corps officer said it was part of an urban training exercise where the osprey aircraft
[1:23:35.600 --> 1:23:39.040]  very dangerous by the way those things are always crashing they don't even let those
[1:23:39.040 --> 1:23:44.880]  fly over cities usually but land in tight spaces neighbors say the aircraft was flying right over
[1:23:44.880 --> 1:23:49.680]  the rooftops an osprey you have any idea how deadly dangerous those things aren't even cleared to fly
[1:23:49.680 --> 1:23:57.120]  yet i thought or the tilt tilt pull up an osprey yeah the tilt wing aircraft with the big propellers
[1:23:57.120 --> 1:24:01.520]  captain robert shoe for the 24th marine expeditionary unit apologize the neighbors folks
[1:24:02.080 --> 1:24:07.440]  delta force crashed in houston delta force fired in an all night restaurant in miami hitting the
[1:24:07.440 --> 1:24:12.960]  table pieces of glass went in the woman's face they bribed the san antonio government till the
[1:24:12.960 --> 1:24:18.720]  police chief stopped it they tried to bribe the travis county government i mean this is on record
[1:24:18.720 --> 1:24:24.240]  the the army is involved putting liaison officers in everywhere they're involved taking over and
[1:24:24.240 --> 1:24:31.040]  they're doing urban warfare drills admittedly to acclimate the public we've had them come up to us

[1:24:53.040 --> 1:24:58.000]  right off roofs you get within a hundred feet of a house anyway side issue the point is i've
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:01.680]  read a lot about these because they're always crashing killing the troops and the pennant
[1:25:01.680 --> 1:25:06.400]  even rumsfeld said it was the greatest lemon ever known but because it's a special interest
[1:25:06.400 --> 1:25:11.200]  or behind it oh we've got to have it and of course they'll probably crash over neighborhoods and
[1:25:11.200 --> 1:25:17.040]  thank you for blowing up on my house i love the troops and now they have regular army marines

[1:33:18.880 --> 1:33:26.560]  i read about i witness that when people think i exaggerate how bad things are no i had forgotten
[1:33:26.560 --> 1:33:33.280]  that i had the elevator had opened on level three at the big hotel whatever it's the biggest building
[1:33:33.280 --> 1:33:40.400]  and billing 17 stories the the the doors had opened and it was homeland security with the
[1:33:40.400 --> 1:33:45.760]  girl scouts and there were police and uniforms and i was like oh and just went back into the
[1:33:45.760 --> 1:33:50.960]  elevator it's like the movie the body snatchers where he finally makes it to the highway and he's
[1:33:50.960 --> 1:33:55.360]  he's running and he's going we're in danger they're coming they're taking over you gotta warn
[1:33:55.360 --> 1:33:59.360]  everybody and people are like get out of here buddy you're drunk pushing him out of the 18
[1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:04.000]  wheeler cab and he he looks at the back of the 18 wheeler and there are the seed bods you know i
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:09.840]  just been in the town nearby where foreign mercenaries were taking over and it was all and
[1:34:09.840 --> 1:34:15.040]  then i'm back in billings and walk off the elevator and and then i'm trying to fly back to austin and
[1:34:15.040 --> 1:34:19.840]  they were total nazis to old ladies and screaming at everyone and treating everybody like crap
[1:34:23.360 --> 1:34:28.160]  see they were told to do that seven years ago to get everybody trained but now phase two is to
[1:34:28.160 --> 1:34:32.720]  act friendly and have a cool fan blowing on you homeland security amidst they changed the uniforms
[1:34:32.720 --> 1:34:37.840]  to blue to make it soothing but i guess that hasn't gotten in there they are polite now
[1:34:39.200 --> 1:34:43.040]  but see we've already been trained to be slaves and now they intensify with though what they have
[1:34:43.040 --> 1:34:48.000]  you do this was still the old upgrade and it was it was just hellish
[1:34:50.480 --> 1:34:54.000]  and folks you're being trained to be a slave for a reason they are going to take your standard
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:58.880]  living they're going to micromanage your life let's take calls nick and iowa than anita joe
[1:34:58.880 --> 1:35:05.920]  mark and others go ahead nick you're on the air hey alex how you doing oh you know i've been off
[1:35:05.920 --> 1:35:11.920]  the air a few days and it just seeing the police state even in montana freaks me out oh yeah i would
[1:35:11.920 --> 1:35:18.400]  have to agree with you uh congratulations on making obama's list there man obviously that uh
[1:35:19.040 --> 1:35:24.640]  the little word that kind of reminds me of one reagan went out and said that timothy leary was
[1:35:24.640 --> 1:35:31.600]  the most dangerous man in america you know i guess orwell was off by about 25 years but
[1:35:31.600 --> 1:35:38.000]  man this shit's actually happening right now all right sir i appreciate your call um look
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:47.920]  look yes i have made the list of uh number 24 number 24
[1:35:50.080 --> 1:35:53.760]  and the president reporting there is an enemy's list the globe of all places
[1:35:55.120 --> 1:35:59.040]  basically like the inquirer says i'm number 24 on the list ahead of michelle melton
[1:35:59.040 --> 1:36:03.200]  but that's all a left right paradigm list and obama does have his right wing
[1:36:03.200 --> 1:36:10.400]  enemies that are a threat to his administration but only to his puppet them obama's meant to be
[1:36:10.400 --> 1:36:15.200]  built up and then destroyed as i said in the obama deception that i started making when he was
[1:36:15.200 --> 1:36:19.520]  elected that was released a month and a half into his administration when he still had 65
[1:36:19.520 --> 1:36:24.720]  percent approval ratings we explained he's going to be built up and then destroyed because he's a
[1:36:24.720 --> 1:36:29.840]  puppet he's meant to take the blame as if he runs something i made the point to all the foolish
[1:36:29.840 --> 1:36:34.560]  leftists out there you're going to end up appreciating me attacking obama in the end
[1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:39.120]  because he's meant to discredit you they build him up they tear him down
[1:36:39.120 --> 1:36:43.440]  same thing with the next republican they put in that's how this works and the people
[1:36:43.440 --> 1:36:48.320]  never think about the real power structure anita in texas anita you're on the air go ahead
[1:36:49.600 --> 1:36:56.800]  hey alex god bless you and jason and all the people that um is doing all this for everybody
[1:36:56.800 --> 1:37:01.920]  and as well as yourselves i know but i got two totally different subject questions i want to ask
[1:37:01.920 --> 1:37:09.600]  you um since your dad is a dentist i was wondering if the shot that they give an okay shot are they
[1:37:09.600 --> 1:37:15.120]  safe i mean could they have by marisol or quailine or any of that stuff in there yeah they don't
[1:37:15.120 --> 1:37:22.160]  they don't have the marisol because they're not a vaccine uh they they put the mercury in there
[1:37:22.160 --> 1:37:28.400]  there to really kill anything else that was grown on the dead babies of the dead monkey
[1:37:28.400 --> 1:37:34.800]  tissue or the caterpillar eggs i mean they grow vaccines on caterpillar eggs dead baby eyeballs
[1:37:34.800 --> 1:37:41.440]  retinas uh and and other bizarre things certain things that have the type tissue they need
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:49.360]  for it to grow in and it grows in a whole list of hard things uh the shots you get at a dental
[1:37:49.360 --> 1:38:00.800]  office are a drug like aspirin or like uh pepto bismol it's novocaine or lidocaine
[1:38:01.600 --> 1:38:07.040]  it's a pain killer uh and i do believe it has a preservative but i think it's like a food
[1:38:07.040 --> 1:38:12.800]  preservative i don't have it in front of me uh but i've uh actually did i don't know off and on
[1:38:12.800 --> 1:38:16.960]  for about a year some dental assisting i didn't really like all the blood and stuff but i did
[1:38:16.960 --> 1:38:23.360]  learn quite a bit about it and no there's no thimerosal in that because the the thimerosal
[1:38:23.360 --> 1:38:28.720]  is trying to is trying to kill something biological you know they say it's a preservative
[1:38:28.720 --> 1:38:33.760]  but it's really just in case something else is in there and and and mercury kills organisms
[1:38:33.760 --> 1:38:38.080]  so that's why they use mercury does that answer your question anita yes it does
[1:38:38.080 --> 1:38:42.880]  can i ask you one quick more thing sure have you heard about the these they've said so many
[1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:48.240]  i can't remember how many pregnant women dying of the flu shot i mean not a flu shot of the flu
[1:38:48.240 --> 1:38:55.120]  so far and i was just wondering if if that's very accurate and if they've actually had the flu shot
[1:38:55.120 --> 1:39:00.240]  i mean how could we tell that these women may have had the flu shot and got it from the flu shot
[1:39:00.240 --> 1:39:05.760]  well ma'am i appreciate your call look i've had scores of medical doctors here on this show so
[1:39:05.760 --> 1:39:12.320]  this is not my opinion the german news mainline respected news publications are reporting
[1:39:12.320 --> 1:39:21.360]  live cancer viruses in this flu shot the internal cdc report leaked over a month ago this is the
[1:39:21.360 --> 1:39:27.440]  centers for disease control said they believe it's going to cause neurological disorders like gillian
[1:39:27.440 --> 1:39:36.320]  beret okay that's on record they always admit that even the best vaccines have our adverse
[1:39:36.320 --> 1:39:42.560]  reactions now they're lying with this pr campaign launched by roiders who the uh one of the top
[1:39:42.560 --> 1:39:47.920]  guys at roiders is is is involved with some of the big vaccine companies saying there's no such
[1:39:47.920 --> 1:39:53.520]  thing as a bad vaccine reaction no one who dies or gets sick after taking this got it from the
[1:39:53.520 --> 1:40:00.160]  shot it's impossible now when somebody preemptively practices medicine without ever seeing you and
[1:40:00.160 --> 1:40:10.160]  says the shot didn't do this the shot didn't do this you know they're covering up here's an example
[1:40:10.160 --> 1:40:16.560]  there have been hundreds of deaths in the trials and then lately now with the Gardasil shot they
[1:40:16.560 --> 1:40:24.000]  admit it in the insert that the drug company merc puts out the they admit that it doesn't protect
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:29.200]  you from human papilloma virus and that actually when you have that virus it cuts down on other
[1:40:29.200 --> 1:40:38.480]  types of cancers by 50 percent yes when you have the common papilloma virus and have an infection
[1:40:38.480 --> 1:40:44.960]  which it's the same kind of virus stepping on a nail folks most the public has it there's estimates
[1:40:44.960 --> 1:40:51.600]  of high as 90 percent okay i mean i stepped on a nail when i was a kid and i've been to the doctor
[1:40:51.600 --> 1:40:56.400]  and i've pulled it out with pliers myself and it always comes back in the bottom because i stepped
[1:40:56.400 --> 1:41:01.120]  right through a nail in a construction site not listening to mama she said don't go playing
[1:41:01.120 --> 1:41:05.760]  that construction site but i went and played on it stepped right through a nail that was in a board
[1:41:06.320 --> 1:41:12.640]  and i get a wart that goes up in my foot and you know what your people that have dogs have
[1:41:12.640 --> 1:41:18.400]  lower cancer rates live on average five years longer why you get more flora more bacteria
[1:41:19.280 --> 1:41:25.120]  they've done stuff you know what it's very complex the the point here is is that when you
[1:41:25.120 --> 1:41:30.720]  have those warts when you have that papilloma virus there's thousands of them different variants
[1:41:31.360 --> 1:41:38.720]  many forms of cancer that are viral that natural virus gives you a buffer to the more deadly types
[1:41:41.120 --> 1:41:44.960]  you ever heard of kids that were always clean and kept too clean never allowed to play outside
[1:41:44.960 --> 1:41:50.400]  how sick their whole lives my dad had a black nanny he loved as you know as much as his grandma
[1:41:50.400 --> 1:41:55.360]  mom and she told my grandmother she said because my dad was getting sick a lot when he was little
[1:41:55.360 --> 1:42:00.720]  until he's about two she said mrs jones you're you're not letting david play in the dirt
[1:42:01.200 --> 1:42:04.960]  and and and and you know get all the stuff he needs that's why he's sick and she would sneak
[1:42:04.960 --> 1:42:09.840]  him off and let him get dirty playing outside and even gave him some chicken manure tea called
[1:42:09.840 --> 1:42:16.080]  hindu tea wasn't sick anymore after that that old black woman knew a lot more than these jackass
[1:42:16.080 --> 1:42:23.680]  doctors who were nothing but corporate salesmen to set a precedent to force vaccines into the
[1:42:23.680 --> 1:42:28.400]  public and that's what this is is big vaccine makers have admitted lately oh we're going to
[1:42:28.400 --> 1:42:35.280]  switch away from drugs now and some drugs actually are good pharmaceuticals into vaccines because
[1:42:35.280 --> 1:42:40.800]  we can just force the government pay the government off to make you take it and i've got here's the
[1:42:40.800 --> 1:42:47.520]  sunday express jab is deadly as the cancer top doctor says the Gardasil killing people
[1:42:47.520 --> 1:42:53.200]  dr diane harper gonna get her on fewer face lockout for failing to get vaccination they're
[1:42:53.200 --> 1:42:58.640]  making kids take all the shots the new flu shots to get into school there's no law it's just it's

[1:46:53.120 --> 1:47:06.240]  one last time it's here's what you do dot net direct from austin coast to coast and in your face
[1:47:06.240 --> 1:47:22.160]  you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network
[1:47:22.160 --> 1:47:38.400]  oh boy you know somebody's got a rant and read about what's happening
[1:47:39.840 --> 1:47:46.560]  new york healthcare workers illinois healthcare workers nurses are revolting the majority of
[1:47:46.560 --> 1:47:51.200]  them are saying they're not taking the shot but see they have a captive audience in the public
[1:47:51.200 --> 1:47:56.960]  schools obama gets up in lies and says there's no law you're not going to have to take the shots
[1:47:56.960 --> 1:48:02.800]  and then the public schools say oh it's on our list as a policy we want you to take it then they
[1:48:02.800 --> 1:48:09.760]  kick you out of school for a violation of policy not law not telling you that parents in all 50
[1:48:09.760 --> 1:48:15.760]  states went and got laws passed that they can't kick you out for not taking shots they're committing
[1:48:15.760 --> 1:48:22.960]  crimes not telling you about the vaccine waiver form because they're a bunch of local boss hogs
[1:48:22.960 --> 1:48:29.280]  even if you believe it's great to get the flu shot you better google study
[1:48:31.520 --> 1:48:39.360]  study show flu shots double Alzheimer's three flu shots it's kind of like wearing headphones
[1:48:39.360 --> 1:48:45.120]  with blasting music i've worn headphones for 14 years on the radio i now have a ring in my ears
[1:48:45.120 --> 1:48:49.600]  all the time i've gone to a little earpiece and have it way down like russia limbaugh i might go
[1:48:49.600 --> 1:48:54.640]  deaf folks well it's the same thing you take those flu shots that's why you're so stupid
[1:48:55.200 --> 1:48:59.600]  they're full of mercury in fact i printed off the insert for the current flu shot that says
[1:48:59.600 --> 1:49:04.160]  it has mercury in it but the moron public they'll tell you at these drug stores it doesn't have
[1:49:04.160 --> 1:49:14.320]  mercury ask for the insert and read it says mercury one one epidemiologist explained it to
[1:49:14.320 --> 1:49:20.640]  me this way you know how a bee sting makes around five percent of the population go into shock and
[1:49:21.360 --> 1:49:28.880]  swell up and can't breathe i'd i'd been stung by bees many times in my life but one time i had a
[1:49:28.880 --> 1:49:34.320]  swarm of them because i was doing some gardening at my parents when i was in high school chased me
[1:49:34.320 --> 1:49:39.520]  out of a tree they were in and i got stung probably 15 times or so and i swole up red and had
[1:49:39.520 --> 1:49:44.320]  trouble breathing and put a bunch of baking soda on myself and gotten a hot bath trying to soak it out but
[1:49:44.320 --> 1:49:48.720]  most people would have gone to the hospital well it's the same and i always laughed at people
[1:49:48.720 --> 1:49:53.680]  that were scared of bees until that point now i developed an alert allergic response to them now
[1:49:53.680 --> 1:49:56.800]  i'm a little more concerned about them because let me tell you it wasn't fun crawling around on the
[1:49:56.800 --> 1:50:04.800]  floor having trouble breathing my phobia the hospital was bigger than that of the not being
[1:50:04.800 --> 1:50:10.240]  able to breathe but the issue is you maybe only five percent of people get violently ill when they
[1:50:10.240 --> 1:50:18.080]  get stung by a bee well you talk about the population that gets a baby whose immune system isn't ready
[1:50:18.080 --> 1:50:23.120]  and they admit now they shoot babies up routinely they even have a syndrome when they're born they
[1:50:23.120 --> 1:50:29.360]  suddenly can't nurse they go into shock it brain damages them you take a big old shot probably a
[1:50:29.360 --> 1:50:35.760]  thousand times the fluid that's in a bee sting full of all sorts of RNA and DNA from the monkey
[1:50:35.760 --> 1:50:40.400]  tissue that are the are the fetal tissue they grew it on and cancer viruses they admit are in
[1:50:40.400 --> 1:50:47.120]  almost all vaccines and you shoot that in i mean a big old shot into a baby and you do it over and
[1:50:47.120 --> 1:50:52.160]  over and over again of course you're going to have autoimmune responses and allergic responses
[1:50:52.160 --> 1:50:58.880]  and of course the brain's going to swell up if you've got had a pre-existing health problem the
[1:50:58.880 --> 1:51:05.120]  smallpox shots kill you causes an autoimmune response in the heart especially we've already
[1:51:05.120 --> 1:51:12.320]  got inflammation in your heart valves folks this isn't good but now they just lie and say it's the
[1:51:12.320 --> 1:51:19.760]  law your kid's got to take it let's talk to joe and canada joe you're on the air hi alex thanks
[1:51:19.760 --> 1:51:25.760]  for taking my call and i can uh see you're here rather that you're pretty fired up and mad today
[1:51:25.760 --> 1:51:31.760]  um i guess anyone would be if you know when they're getting attacked from all sides and
[1:51:31.760 --> 1:51:38.400]  you know it's a lot of these attacks are coming from you know the you know from folks who you
[1:51:38.400 --> 1:51:43.040]  know base a lot of the criticism on name calling in rhetoric sir sir atlas and i appreciate your
[1:51:43.040 --> 1:51:48.720]  call but i'm not here talking about me no i'm not fired up today because people are attacking me
[1:51:48.720 --> 1:51:51.600]  and i appreciate you defending me but i want to hurry here at the end
[1:51:51.600 --> 1:52:01.120]  this isn't about alex jones no i'm not fired up because people are attacking me i don't care
[1:52:01.120 --> 1:52:06.000]  that people attack me i don't even know i don't even pay attention to it most of the time i don't
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:11.200]  like it when it becomes a diversion from what i'm covering and what we're going over we know the
[1:52:11.200 --> 1:52:17.760]  garter cell shot is killing girls now they want to force it on boys we know there's no law your
[1:52:17.760 --> 1:52:22.960]  kids have got to take the regular flu shot and the new h1n1 but they're the schools are lying and
[1:52:22.960 --> 1:52:35.840]  saying they have to take it that's what the show's about i mean look at this in fact where's the
[1:52:35.840 --> 1:52:42.400]  article i had or the doctor okay this is the sunday express the cervical cancer vaccine may
[1:52:42.400 --> 1:52:47.040]  be riskier and more deadly than the cancer it is designed to prevent yeah it only kills 3000 women
[1:52:47.040 --> 1:52:52.320]  a year in the u.s a 300 million a leading expert who developed the drug has warned
[1:52:53.920 --> 1:52:58.640]  she helped develop it now they admit on the insert it doesn't even protect you from the virus
[1:52:58.640 --> 1:53:04.000]  but it is an attenuated live cancer virus and causes all sorts of autoimmune responses because
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:09.280]  you get it at tens of thousands of times what you get from pricking yourself on a nail or from
[1:53:09.280 --> 1:53:14.000]  somebody having sex with you you understand they pump a ton of it into your directly into your
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:18.560]  bloodstream your body's designed to have this stuff come to the mucous membrane or the mouth of
[1:53:18.560 --> 1:53:25.360]  the skin where your defenses are not jammed into your muscle tissue she also claimed the jab would
[1:53:25.360 --> 1:53:29.680]  do nothing to reduce the rates of cervical cancer in the uk speaking exclusively to the sunday express
[1:53:29.680 --> 1:53:36.000]  dr diane harper who was involved in the clinical trials of the controversial drug
[1:53:37.040 --> 1:53:42.160]  cervivax that's the british name of uh Gardasil so the jab was being over marketed
[1:53:42.160 --> 1:53:47.120]  and parents should be properly warned about the potential side effects okay and it mentions
[1:53:47.120 --> 1:53:51.760]  all the deaths and autoimmune disease that's one of the doctors that helped design the crap
[1:53:52.720 --> 1:53:58.080]  put that in your pipe dr dina dell drug company operative up there every day saying none of this
[1:53:58.080 --> 1:54:04.800]  is true people are dying from this they got big news last week when this girl died from in the
[1:54:04.800 --> 1:54:09.360]  uk and i've seen all these other deaths and i said it's going to end up she didn't die from this
[1:54:09.360 --> 1:54:13.840]  because they're hyping it they know she died of something else so they're going to ignore all the
[1:54:13.840 --> 1:54:19.200]  real deaths and hype it but what did she die from she had a tumor in her heart she died within hours
[1:54:19.200 --> 1:54:23.840]  of taking the shot because that's what the scientists have said on this show it causes an
[1:54:23.840 --> 1:54:29.840]  autoimmune response wherever you already have inflammation in your body like your pancreas
[1:54:29.840 --> 1:54:39.920]  that's why diabetes is is off the charts even with people who aren't eating a bunch of processed sugar
[1:54:39.920 --> 1:54:48.400]  let's talk to mark in oregon mark you're on the air hello alec hey buddy hey man uh welcome back
[1:54:48.400 --> 1:54:54.880]  from the twilight zone by the way well i i mean out of the fire into the oven yeah yeah i you really

[1:55:05.520 --> 1:55:09.920]  account of the girl scouts from the hotel i know we're not supposed to laugh at certain things but
[1:55:09.920 --> 1:55:15.440]  sometimes things get so ridiculous that we listen listen but i mean i wasn't ready for it though
[1:55:15.440 --> 1:55:21.280]  we know we we've been up late working then i took the guys really late like a midnight showing a
[1:55:21.280 --> 1:55:27.280]  pandorum excellent movie by the way side issue so we i get up early i got to go catch the flight
[1:55:27.280 --> 1:55:34.320]  at like you know eight a.m it's like six we've eaten i guess the flight was about nine so it's
[1:55:34.320 --> 1:55:40.640]  like seven forty five i've got to get where i'm going and the door is open on the wrong floor
[1:55:40.640 --> 1:55:45.520]  and i look out and it's cops homeland security sign and girl scouts and i just wasn't ready for it
[1:55:45.520 --> 1:55:52.240]  and was like back into the elevator but i mean so it wasn't a laughing matter at the time it
[1:55:52.240 --> 1:55:57.360]  actually freaked me out to actually see the nazi vacation of america it's one thing to
[1:55:57.360 --> 1:56:01.200]  read the girl scouts are going to serve homeland security it's another thing to see it with your
[1:56:01.200 --> 1:56:06.960]  own eyeballs yeah i'm sure those dark green uniforms really brought it home uh we're not
[1:56:06.960 --> 1:56:13.760]  used to those uniforms representing uh such things as this alec normally uh symbolize that
[1:56:13.760 --> 1:56:19.920]  coconut chocolate cookie and i like so much absolutely for years alex i wanted to relate
[1:56:19.920 --> 1:56:26.160]  to you real quickly uh on dr bill deagle show this past thursday october 1st uh dr deagle's
[1:56:26.160 --> 1:56:32.080]  guest was dr allen truott i believe because he's dr deagle first to him sometimes is dr
[1:56:32.080 --> 1:56:37.840]  odd but i believe it's dr allen truott who has done extensive research into the american police
[1:56:37.840 --> 1:56:43.520]  force group entity and he said that his research shows that the parent company of the american
[1:56:43.520 --> 1:56:49.040]  police force group is a company named phoenix international and that the parent company of
[1:56:49.040 --> 1:56:55.520]  phoenix international is dinecore we've all heard that name dr truott reports that the headquarters
[1:56:55.520 --> 1:57:01.600]  of phoenix international is in the langley virginia area and dr truott also related that
[1:57:01.600 --> 1:57:07.280]  george soros is largely invested i'm out of time i'm going to talk about this more tomorrow
[1:57:07.280 --> 1:57:13.440]  tomorrow there are some connections to that group allied defense systems and a bunch of
[1:57:13.440 --> 1:57:22.640]  others but all those groups are saying that they met with the hilton character the mercenary guy
[1:57:22.640 --> 1:57:27.520]  but that they're not with him and now he's removed all their names off their sites so either he's a
[1:57:27.520 --> 1:57:33.440]  total con man or he could be connected to these groups we don't know we're still investigating
[1:57:33.440 --> 1:57:39.120]  yes i was on the ground in harden we have a full report tomorrow by the way my new film shifts out
