[00:00.000 --> 00:13.640]  Big Brother, mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[00:13.640 --> 00:24.440]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:24.440 --> 00:32.080]  May 5th, 2011. It's the Alex Jones Show live. I'm your host, Paul Joseph Watson, editor and
[00:32.080 --> 00:38.880]  writer for PrisonAtPlanet.com, filling in for Alex today. And we've got two huge guests coming
[00:38.880 --> 00:45.480]  up over the course of the next 90 minutes to discuss this unravelling Osama bin Laden fable,
[00:45.480 --> 00:52.880]  both of whom held highly influential positions within the US government and both of whom have
[00:52.880 --> 01:00.800]  vocally savaged this bin Laden narrative that has been put out by the White House for the fair
[01:00.800 --> 01:08.880]  retail that it is. The guests are former Assistant Treasury Secretary under Reagan, Paul Craig Roberts,
[01:08.880 --> 01:16.400]  and of course, the third installment of our interview with Steve R. Pechenick, who worked as a top
[01:16.400 --> 01:25.280]  spy master in no less than five US administrations, cannot be called a black helicopter conspiracy
[01:25.280 --> 01:31.680]  fantasist as the Time magazine article yesterday would have it. Of course, they're afraid to
[01:31.680 --> 01:37.200]  address any of the issues that Pechenick has raised over the course of the last two days on the
[01:37.200 --> 01:44.360]  Alex Jones Show. We've got Infowars video guru Rob Jacobson coming up live, reporting from ground
[01:44.360 --> 01:50.760]  zero later on in this, actually in the next segment, as Obama gets ready to pull off his
[01:50.760 --> 01:58.200]  contrived photo op, mimicking how George W. Bush stood on the rubble of the Twin Towers shortly
[01:58.200 --> 02:06.120]  after 9-11 and what amounts to basically a desperate PR stunt to contrive a political
[02:06.120 --> 02:13.280]  turnaround for his alien aspirations to get a second term in the Oval Office. Second half of
[02:13.280 --> 02:19.760]  the show will be hosted by Steve Watson and Aaron Dykes and then Alex Jones himself will be calling
[02:19.760 --> 02:28.000]  in from the road to give his take on the unfolding, collapsing, crumbling Bin Laden fable. And the
[02:28.000 --> 02:33.920]  Bin Laden hoax really is collapsing now, whether you believe he was killed recently or, you know,
[02:33.920 --> 02:39.680]  he was killed nine years ago as Pechenick has asserted. The fact is that this whole narrative
[02:39.680 --> 02:45.920]  they've manufactured around the alleged raid and assassination of Bin Laden is compound there in
[02:45.920 --> 02:53.600]  Pakistan is totally crumbling to the ground. It's beginning to resemble more and more a Jerry
[02:53.600 --> 03:01.320]  Brookheimer style Jessica Lynch fable. We had the photo of Obama giving the address to the
[03:01.320 --> 03:08.040]  nation on Sunday night, which appeared the next morning in US newspapers, completely staged
[03:08.040 --> 03:13.320]  after the event. That has now been admitted. That's on the record. But more importantly,
[03:13.320 --> 03:19.480]  the photos released just a couple of days ago by the White House, the so-called situation room
[03:19.480 --> 03:26.120]  photos that people have said depict the quote defining moment of Obama's presidency. And these
[03:26.120 --> 03:33.480]  were the photos that the mainstream media reported illustrated Obama, Hillary Clinton and their
[03:33.480 --> 03:40.600]  White House security team grimacing their faces with these stern looks, watching the raid on
[03:40.600 --> 03:47.640]  the Bin Laden compound and watching his assassination unfold live on the big screen in front of them.
[03:47.640 --> 03:52.840]  And we've got a photo of those pictures that the White House released that we're showing now.
[03:54.040 --> 04:01.160]  And he had this shot of a shocked Hillary Clinton and a hand anxiously over a mouth as if reacting
[04:01.160 --> 04:08.840]  to some crucial event. You had the news telling us that this depicted the moment when, quote,
[04:08.840 --> 04:14.280]  the leader of the free world saw the terror chief shot in the left eye. That's what they
[04:14.280 --> 04:20.680]  actually told us. We were told that this photograph depicted Obama, Clinton and Biden,
[04:20.680 --> 04:26.680]  quote, watching intently as the raid takes place. And you had the White House counter
[04:26.680 --> 04:33.160]  terrorism. John Brennan come out and say that this was evidence of the fact that Obama and Clinton
[04:33.160 --> 04:39.720]  were provided with, quote, ongoing coverage of the raid as it unfolded. And so this was told to
[04:39.720 --> 04:44.680]  us as a dramatic part of the Bin Laden narrative. And of course, it turns out to be a complete
[04:44.680 --> 04:50.920]  hoax, a completely staged fable. And we'll be back after the break to detail how this whole
[04:50.920 --> 04:56.920]  Bin Laden fraud is collapsing at warp speed. Stay tuned. It's the Alex Jones show live.
[05:00.280 --> 05:04.920]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and
[05:04.920 --> 05:10.200]  disasters in unprecedented numbers. People have had to literally run for their lives. Folks,
[05:10.200 --> 05:15.240]  this is Steve Shank with E-Foods Direct. I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes,

[05:59.800 --> 06:05.800]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in
[06:05.800 --> 06:11.320]  America in more than 50 years. He says it will change everything about our lives. The way you shop,
[06:11.320 --> 06:15.400]  travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own
[06:15.400 --> 06:20.120]  family. Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is
[06:20.120 --> 06:24.840]  he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Pannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and
[06:24.840 --> 06:29.640]  America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties. In fact, Barron's called his work
[06:29.640 --> 06:34.520]  a dire prophecy. Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing
[06:34.520 --> 06:39.240]  his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener. I can't stress this
[06:39.240 --> 06:43.160]  enough. You should at least watch this free video online today. He explains everything
[06:43.160 --> 06:47.560]  you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself. You can find the video
[06:47.560 --> 06:57.560]  at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of America, the number three.com. Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.

[08:22.120 --> 08:29.240]  We're back on the Alex Jones show this May 5th, 2011. I'm Paul Joseph Watson.
[08:29.240 --> 08:35.080]  Paul Craig Roberts coming up at the bottom of the hour and shortly we'll be joined by Rob Jacobson,
[08:35.080 --> 08:42.600]  Infowars Video Guru, live from Ground Zero New York as Obama prepares to descend for his staged
[08:42.600 --> 08:50.120]  photo op. And speaking of photo ops, we had the dramatic release of these situation room images
[08:50.120 --> 08:55.880]  by the White House a couple of days ago, which the media told us depicted Obama and his staff,
[08:55.880 --> 09:02.920]  including Hillary Clinton, reacting live as the assassination of Bin Laden unfolded on the big
[09:02.920 --> 09:08.280]  screen in front of them. They said that these Navy SEALs had cameras attached to their helmets and
[09:08.280 --> 09:16.840]  that Obama was able to watch the whole episode go down live. Actually, it turns out that there was
[09:16.840 --> 09:24.440]  no moment at all when Obama saw Bin Laden assassinated, supposedly shot in the head,
[09:24.440 --> 09:31.000]  because according to Leon Panetta, the CIA director, the video feed on these cameras was
[09:31.000 --> 09:39.480]  completely cut off before the Navy SEALs even entered the building. So for all the stern faces and
[09:40.040 --> 09:46.200]  shocked expressions that the media told us were going on in these photos as a result of Clinton
[09:46.200 --> 09:53.880]  and Obama witnessing the raid live, they actually saw nothing whatsoever. They didn't find out what
[09:53.880 --> 09:59.880]  had happened until it was all over. And these photos were basically staged in a PR stunt
[09:59.880 --> 10:08.120]  for public consumption, just as the rescue in quotations of Jessica Lynch and the death
[10:08.120 --> 10:15.480]  of Pat Tillman were also manufactured for public consumption. Fables to generate this contrived
[10:15.480 --> 10:23.240]  jingoism, this phony pro-war sentiment that Obama is now desperately trying to capitalize on
[10:24.120 --> 10:31.160]  in an effort to rebrand himself as this tough, respected leader. All the Republicans are now
[10:31.160 --> 10:37.960]  clicking their heels because Obama was tough. He got the job done. He got the job done in
[10:38.520 --> 10:44.440]  basically lying to the American people in front of tens of millions of viewers. On Sunday night,
[10:44.440 --> 10:51.960]  Obama said that the assassination of bin Laden followed a quote, 40-minute shootout.
[10:52.760 --> 10:58.520]  Now, bear in mind, Obama never saw this took place because the live feed from the cameras
[10:58.520 --> 11:04.600]  had been cut. And now after the fact it's been admitted that there was no shootout.
[11:04.600 --> 11:09.720]  There was one individual in the whole compound that was armed, and he wasn't even in the house.
[11:09.720 --> 11:16.440]  He was at a house across the street. We had these lauded tales about bin Laden throwing his wife
[11:16.440 --> 11:24.520]  in front of himself as a human shield, complete fallacy, made up, contrived. We had the tales of
[11:24.520 --> 11:31.080]  bin Laden resisting, defending himself, firing back, again, completely made up, contrived. He
[11:31.080 --> 11:41.000]  wasn't armed. And you would think, you know, with all this gracious applauding of torture,
[11:41.000 --> 11:45.560]  how it supposedly led them to find bin Laden, that turns out to be completely untrue as well,
[11:47.240 --> 11:52.120]  that they would have wanted to keep alive the number one intelligence asset in the world as
[11:52.120 --> 11:58.680]  armed bin Laden. He wasn't armed. At first they allegedly took him alive, but then they put
[11:58.680 --> 12:03.560]  a bullet through his head. Now, if you think that torture is so good at eliciting vital
[12:03.560 --> 12:07.960]  information, would you want to keep Osama bin Laden alive, or would you want to get rid of him
[12:07.960 --> 12:15.480]  straight away? So basically, Obama lied. He said there was a 40-minute shootout. He went on national
[12:15.480 --> 12:22.200]  television in his public address on Sunday night, and he completely lied, a totally impeachable
[12:22.200 --> 12:28.520]  offence because it was basically a slaughter in cold blood. There was no firefight. There was
[12:28.520 --> 12:36.360]  no live feed to Obama and Clinton as these staged photos suggested there was, as the media told
[12:36.360 --> 12:43.160]  us that Obama saw the moment when bin Laden was shot in his head above the left eye, completely
[12:43.720 --> 12:50.600]  made up, contrived fable. Obama, Clinton saw none of it, but they put out these staged photos of
[12:50.600 --> 12:56.600]  them looking shocked as the event unfolded supposedly live. And of course, Hillary Clinton
[12:56.600 --> 13:03.320]  has come out today after it all was revealed and said, oh, I just had allergies. I just had my hand
[13:03.320 --> 13:09.480]  over my mouth. And this is already after they've claimed that it was the moments when the raid
[13:09.480 --> 13:16.040]  was happening, even though they didn't see it happen, which is now being admitted. So lie upon
[13:16.040 --> 13:22.520]  lie and nothing about the fairy tale adds up. And even some quarters of the mainstream media are
[13:22.520 --> 13:30.200]  now having to admit that fact. The White House press secretary Carney is being lambasted left,
[13:30.200 --> 13:36.200]  right and center as a failure as a flounder. Because he keeps tripping over his own words,
[13:36.200 --> 13:43.160]  his own lies during the press briefings, because they're having trouble keeping this whole narrative
[13:43.160 --> 13:50.520]  in order. You know, tell the truth and you never have to remember anything. But this
[13:50.520 --> 13:56.280]  Carney guy is so overwhelmed by the fact that the White House keeps flip flopping and changing the
[13:56.280 --> 14:03.640]  narrative that even he can't keep up. But don't worry about all that because according to Time
[14:03.640 --> 14:09.320]  magazine and the majority of the establishment media, anyone who points out these blaring
[14:09.320 --> 14:15.960]  discrepancies, these inconsistencies with the official narrative is merely a conspiracy theorist
[14:15.960 --> 14:23.080]  engaging in quote, black helicopter fantasies. That's what the Time magazine writer said yesterday
[14:23.080 --> 14:31.320]  about Alex Jones and all the information that we've presented this week. So presumably, that
[14:31.320 --> 14:36.760]  would include the editor in chief of the Atlantic who has come out herself and questioned these
[14:36.760 --> 14:43.160]  discrepancies. Presumably, that would include the man who all this week on the Alex Jones show
[14:43.160 --> 14:47.880]  and the man who's coming up as a guest in the next hour, Steve Pachennick,
[14:49.880 --> 14:55.160]  who has blown the lid off the entire bin Laden fraud, the fact that he died in 2001.
[14:56.360 --> 15:03.240]  Is he another black helicopter fantasist Time magazine? He served under five US presidents,
[15:03.240 --> 15:09.480]  top spy master. He wrote the book for the State Department on psychological warfare
[15:09.480 --> 15:16.360]  and counterterrorism. He's publicly saying that bin Laden died in 2001. Two days ago,
[15:16.360 --> 15:22.520]  on the Alex Jones show, he said that these situation room photos were completely staged,
[15:22.520 --> 15:29.640]  a fairy tale. He's proven completely right. Again, he's vindicated. Is he a conspiracy
[15:29.640 --> 15:35.640]  theorist, a black helicopter fantasist Time magazine and the rest of the establishment media?
[15:35.640 --> 15:46.360]  You know, they've also created this framing of the debate where anyone who questions the
[15:46.360 --> 15:51.000]  official narrative, which is collapsing left, right and center because they can't keep it straight,
[15:52.200 --> 15:59.160]  is either a wacko paranoid nut job or is some Taliban goat herder that claims bin Laden still
[15:59.160 --> 16:05.160]  alive. So they're framing the debate around that. And then whenever you ask any questions about the
[16:05.160 --> 16:11.560]  whole narrative, even as it collapses, then you're ring fenced under that label. It's psychological
[16:11.560 --> 16:19.000]  warfare. But the whole stack of cards surrounding this bin Laden fable is collapsing at warp speed.
[16:19.000 --> 16:25.080]  And Obama's nine point bounce that he's enjoyed so far is already starting to evaporate,
[16:25.080 --> 16:30.200]  which is why today he's heading down to ground zero to try and reinvigorate
[16:30.200 --> 16:36.040]  this whole jingoistic attitude from the American people. And it's so transparent that they're
[16:36.040 --> 16:43.400]  exploiting this monumental fraud to try and manufacture this post 9 11 kind of intellectual
[16:43.400 --> 16:50.200]  castration of the American people. Because Obama comes out Sunday night and says that killing
[16:50.200 --> 16:57.080]  bin Laden means America is now safer, the world is safer from terrorists. And yet what happens
[16:57.080 --> 17:03.960]  almost instantly, they start fear mongering about nuclear holocausts from the admissions of the
[17:04.600 --> 17:10.280]  tortured Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is being water boarded for the last five years, who will admit to
[17:10.280 --> 17:15.720]  being, you know, the Grinch who stole Christmas, the Tooth Fairy and whatever else after they've
[17:16.200 --> 17:21.160]  tortured him for that amount of time. And now they're talking about raising the terror threat to
[17:21.160 --> 17:27.640]  a new level to a higher level. You've got you've got calls for the TSA to be put in shopping malls,
[17:27.640 --> 17:33.880]  putting their hands down your kids pants. You've got more grope downs. You've got more bag searches
[17:33.880 --> 17:39.800]  and you've got more goons walking around with machine guns. But Obama told us that the world
[17:39.800 --> 17:47.080]  was safer after the death of Osama bin Laden. And yet their reaction suggests that it's only
[17:47.080 --> 17:52.120]  it's only going to become more unsafe because of course, they're the real terrorists launching
[17:52.120 --> 17:59.000]  this psychological warfare operation against us. But it's all because the terrorists hate our freedom,
[17:59.000 --> 18:05.160]  which is why that local TSA child molester needs to get his hands on your children. CBS News
[18:05.160 --> 18:13.080]  reporting yesterday calls for TSA in shopping malls. And you can tell that it's contrived by
[18:13.080 --> 18:19.480]  their own reaction. It's a weird serial killer kind of reaction where they're going back to the
[18:19.480 --> 18:24.680]  scene of the crime. And they're trying to exploit it for all it's worth. Because now with completely
[18:24.680 --> 18:32.200]  unrelated matters, they're hastily trying to spend Obama's political capital to destroy more of our
[18:32.200 --> 18:38.440]  freedoms. Bill Richardson comes out and says that killing bin Laden means that Obama can now push
[18:38.440 --> 18:47.160]  through the cap and tax system. Try and work that one out. We've got a new story today out the hill
[18:47.160 --> 18:54.280]  with Obama pushing ahead with a plan to put satellite tracker boxes in your cars to track
[18:54.280 --> 19:00.840]  you by the mile mandatory. Again, nothing to do with bin Laden, but it's about Obama spending
[19:00.840 --> 19:07.480]  this political capital, this contrived political capital on a whole raft of different agendas
[19:07.480 --> 19:15.160]  that he's been waiting to push through. And if you think that a government that staged an event
[19:15.160 --> 19:22.360]  that started the Vietnam War, the Gulf of Tonkin, complete fabrication never happened, historical
[19:22.360 --> 19:29.160]  fact, if you think that they're not capable of staging a raid on a building in Pakistan, then
[19:29.160 --> 19:34.920]  you've got another thing coming. And the whole thing overriding it, which we'll talk about with
[19:34.920 --> 19:39.400]  Steve Pachennick, is the fact that according to every intelligence professional worth their
[19:39.400 --> 19:48.040]  salt, bin Laden's been dead since 2001. The fable, the fair retail nature of this fraud knows no
[19:48.040 --> 19:54.280]  bounds. We'll be back after the break with Rob Jacobson live from Ground Zero. This is the Alex
[19:54.280 --> 20:03.720]  Jones show live. Stay tuned. Economists, politicians, and even the average citizen can agree we may
[20:03.720 --> 20:08.440]  only be days or weeks away from the next terrible event that could literally change the face of
[20:08.440 --> 20:13.320]  life as we know it. Learn the secrets of the world's top survival and preparedness experts

[20:54.760 --> 21:03.880]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones. The earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster
[21:03.880 --> 21:08.440]  that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the devastation that could
[21:08.440 --> 21:13.400]  be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States and could lead to millions of
[21:13.400 --> 21:18.520]  Americans becoming homeless, all caused by the devalued US dollar, while the mainstream media
[21:18.520 --> 21:23.000]  continues to ignore inflation. Our friends, the National Inflation Association provide
[21:23.000 --> 21:27.560]  a free weekly newsletter that educates Americans of the facts and truth about the US economy
[21:27.560 --> 21:34.040]  and inflation. I urge you to sign up at the NIA's free newsletter at www.inflation.us to learn how
[21:34.040 --> 21:39.160]  you can not only survive but prosper during the upcoming hyperinflation crisis. Silver has more

[22:02.440 --> 22:07.960]  weeks without payment plans or negotiating or hiring an attorney. 18 years ago we cracked the
[22:07.960 --> 22:13.560]  code of debt collections and set tens of thousands of people free of their debts. It's called zero
[22:13.560 --> 22:19.560]  debt guaranteed and it works for all debts. My wages were being garnished so I used the program
[22:19.560 --> 22:24.920]  and the attorney dropped the case and he returned my money within two weeks. With zero debt guaranteed
[22:24.920 --> 22:29.960]  your success is guaranteed in writing. There is no other program of its kind. Don't be alone

[23:35.240 --> 23:39.800]  having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to serve as debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson
[23:39.800 --> 23:43.480]  correct when stating a central bank issuing to public currency is a greater menace to the
[23:43.480 --> 23:47.800]  liberties of the people than a standing army. Hi Ted Anderson I'm placing a silver dollar in a book

[24:25.320 --> 24:32.200]  We're live on the Alex Jones show May the 5th 2011 and we've got Rob Jacobson in Four Wars
[24:32.200 --> 24:39.640]  video guru live on the line from ground zero as Barack Obama prepares to descend on the scene
[24:39.640 --> 24:46.040]  for his staged photo op trying to get as much political capital out this bin Laden fraud as
[24:46.040 --> 24:52.360]  politically possible. Rob we've been bombarded with this fear mongering about these imminent
[24:52.360 --> 24:59.160]  terror attacks and these calls to put the TSA in shopping malls. How has that hype manifested
[24:59.160 --> 25:04.440]  itself in New York as a police state being on full display as you've been traveling around?
[25:06.200 --> 25:12.520]  Well Paul I'm over here at ground zero and it's the usual display of plenty of police.
[25:12.520 --> 25:18.760]  It's the first time I've seen police dogs on the street here in Manhattan and there are police
[25:18.760 --> 25:27.720]  dogs guarding subway stations but it's the usual group of police mixed with secret service types
[25:27.720 --> 25:34.520]  floating up and down the street and the usual high level of security around ground zero
[25:34.520 --> 25:43.320]  eminent to one of these events. I got a group of police officers just marching right in front of
[25:43.320 --> 25:51.640]  me in some kind of two by two formation and it's basically exactly what you just described.
[25:52.600 --> 25:56.360]  Everybody seems to be it doesn't seem that the sentiment is that people are both
[25:56.360 --> 26:05.800]  not as much excited but also scared of what may be next and it's a high sense of paranoia here in
[26:05.800 --> 26:11.880]  New York City. So I'm wondering what kind of crowd is down there at the moment. We saw the
[26:12.920 --> 26:18.360]  celebrations on the White House lawn by these by these college zombies in the aftermath of this
[26:18.360 --> 26:24.520]  bin Laden announcement. Is it more a more quiet affair or are there political banners
[26:24.520 --> 26:33.560]  or any signs of that nature? I'm seeing a few political banners but no hysteria like we seen
[26:33.560 --> 26:38.920]  on the evening that Obama made the announcement. It's mostly people waiting to see the president
[26:40.440 --> 26:47.800]  usual crowd held back by the police line. I did see one sign basically saying that
[26:47.800 --> 26:55.880]  some women's children are proud to be raised in a country where they love their president
[26:56.520 --> 27:02.920]  and that kind of thing but not too many political signs a couple of American flags not
[27:03.880 --> 27:10.760]  like we've seen on the evening of the announcement. Yeah love of president as opposed to love of
[27:10.760 --> 27:16.920]  country they think that's patriotism. I was hearing you were kicked out of the press area. Is that true?
[27:17.960 --> 27:23.240]  That's true. I was in the press area. I was waiting online to actually go into the pit
[27:23.240 --> 27:31.560]  itself. They told me since we didn't contact the White House days and days before I am not qualified
[27:31.560 --> 27:37.320]  to cover the president or take pictures of him in any way. I explained to him I'm here with a
[27:37.320 --> 27:45.080]  nationally syndicated radio show and I was prepared to have our producer get on the line with whoever
[27:45.080 --> 27:51.560]  needed to speak with him to prove that we truly are press. We are probably larger than most of the
[27:53.000 --> 28:01.240]  national labels I've seen waiting online and they simply said just we're not on the White
[28:01.240 --> 28:09.320]  House list we can't enter. Not only myself but other news agencies were denied as well.
[28:10.680 --> 28:17.000]  I know senators staff were denied access to inside unless you were on the White House pre-approved list.
[28:18.520 --> 28:22.520]  Well obviously I mean Obama can't give a town hall speech without every single
[28:22.520 --> 28:29.240]  guess going through this approval process and it's like the media equivalent of the free speech zones
[28:29.240 --> 28:34.920]  you have to ask the government permission to engage in your First Amendment right not only
[28:34.920 --> 28:41.160]  to protest but merely to cover a public media event. It's ridiculous and it's a sign of what's
[28:41.160 --> 28:47.160]  happened after 9-11. Of course the terrorists attacked us because they hate our freedom and then
[28:47.160 --> 28:53.720]  governments, consecutive governments proceeded to take those freedoms away. I'm wondering
[28:53.720 --> 28:59.960]  you've obviously traveled to New York on numerous occasions over the past few years. As somebody
[28:59.960 --> 29:05.640]  who visits often what kind of statement does it make that 10 years nearly after 9-11 ground zero
[29:05.640 --> 29:14.520]  is still virtually a building site? It shows that you know the statement is that either
[29:16.440 --> 29:21.560]  everybody seems that the sentiment around the people is that everybody's a little disappointed
[29:21.560 --> 29:26.440]  that nothing is going on. I see a couple of construction sites here the Liberty Tower is
[29:26.440 --> 29:32.520]  about 63 stories there's another building going up still under construction. This is all going on
[29:33.160 --> 29:37.880]  about 10 years after the actual incident you'd think this would have been going on
[29:37.880 --> 29:42.040]  you know a couple of years after after some planning and and whatnot but.
[29:43.000 --> 29:48.280]  Okay thanks Rob we're heading to the break now stay safe we'll be back on the Alex Jones show
[29:48.280 --> 29:56.200]  live stay tuned Paul Craig Roberts. We're on the march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN
[29:56.200 --> 30:06.520]  Radio Network. Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last
[30:06.520 --> 30:12.200]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda they'll be pulling the rug from
[30:12.200 --> 30:17.960]  underneath the Americans at home. I've determined the members influence on our president in Congress
[30:17.960 --> 30:24.200]  and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens
[30:24.200 --> 30:30.600]  to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[30:30.600 --> 30:36.040]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner
[30:36.040 --> 30:40.760]  Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make
[30:40.760 --> 30:46.520]  the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen
[30:46.520 --> 30:53.960]  a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com we're
[30:53.960 --> 31:01.160]  watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. This is Alex Jones with
[31:01.160 --> 31:06.040]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one new climate
[31:06.040 --> 31:10.920]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two our new energies are
[31:10.920 --> 31:15.720]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true total
[31:15.720 --> 31:21.080]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three
[31:21.080 --> 31:26.040]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[31:26.040 --> 31:31.480]  legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local
[31:31.480 --> 31:36.760]  grids. Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five a
[31:36.760 --> 31:41.640]  solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks I really believe
[31:41.640 --> 31:46.120]  in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science. One of my oldest sponsors. You can
[31:46.120 --> 31:52.920]  get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember the government
[31:52.920 --> 32:01.160]  doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365. A very wealthy U.S.
[32:01.160 --> 32:07.080]  citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than
[32:07.080 --> 32:12.680]  50 years. He says it will change everything about our lives. The way you shop, travel, invest, educate
[32:12.680 --> 32:16.920]  your children and even how you take care of your health and your own family. Now this man has made
[32:16.920 --> 32:21.960]  some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is he's usually right. You see he
[32:21.960 --> 32:26.600]  predicted the collapse of GM. Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest small owner, general
[32:26.600 --> 32:32.680]  growth properties. In fact Barons called his work a dire prophecy. Recently he created a video which
[32:32.680 --> 32:37.560]  you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a real
[32:37.560 --> 32:42.520]  eye-opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today. He
[32:42.520 --> 32:46.600]  explains everything you need to know including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[32:46.600 --> 32:53.240]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com. That's end of America. The number three.

[33:03.240 --> 33:25.160]  Music
[33:28.280 --> 33:32.200]  We're back. Live it's The Alex Jones Show. May 5th, 2011.
[33:32.200 --> 33:38.280]  11 coming up at the top of the hour. Steve Arpojenik, top spy masterworks under five
[33:38.280 --> 33:45.120]  different U.S. presidents to talk about the Bin Laden fable. Now we have President Barack
[33:45.120 --> 33:51.720]  Obama mimicking George W. Bush. He's descended on ground zero and Obama, according to the
[33:51.720 --> 33:59.080]  associate press, is now basically repeating exact similar phrases that George Bush used
[33:59.080 --> 34:05.440]  as he stood on the rubble in those days after 9-11, as Obama desperately attempts to seize
[34:05.440 --> 34:11.960]  on the political capital that this Bin Laden raid has afforded him. But I'm delighted to
[34:11.960 --> 34:17.240]  say that we've been joined by Paul Craig Roberts, who many of you will know, of course, was
[34:17.240 --> 34:25.160]  the father of Reaganomics, served as assistant treasury secretary under Ronald Reagan, former
[34:25.160 --> 34:31.120]  editor of the Wall Street Journal. And of course, Mr. Roberts is a prolific author and
[34:31.120 --> 34:38.600]  writer whose articles we eagerly await to be posted in his latest article on PrismPlanet.com
[34:38.600 --> 34:42.360]  this morning. Mr. Roberts, great to have you on the show today.
[34:42.360 --> 34:45.880]  Thank you, Paul. Good to speak to you.
[34:45.880 --> 34:53.760]  Before you get started with me, I was fascinated by the piece yesterday. Your report, I think
[34:53.760 --> 34:59.040]  it was on Steve Pezenik. Did I pronounce that right?
[34:59.040 --> 35:01.040]  Steve Pezenik, yeah.
[35:01.040 --> 35:08.160]  Yeah. I thought this was amazing. Not so much the Bin Laden part, because I think that's
[35:08.160 --> 35:14.040]  been known for some time. But his statement that he had been told by a general from, I
[35:14.040 --> 35:20.560]  think, Wolfowitz staff that not alone was inside a job and that he was willing himself,
[35:20.560 --> 35:29.360]  Paul, Steve Pezenik, to testify before Congress and reveal the guy's name. Now, this is an
[35:29.360 --> 35:35.040]  astonishing development. This is for real, I take it. I take it you've got this on tape
[35:35.040 --> 35:38.160]  and video or something.
[35:38.160 --> 35:44.680]  It was said live during Mr. Pezenik's interview with Alex Jones on Tuesday. And that's right.
[35:44.680 --> 35:49.480]  And it's been, it's an astounding admission, which has been completely ignored by the mainstream
[35:49.480 --> 35:53.360]  media. They didn't even try and debunk it.
[35:53.360 --> 36:02.600]  You know, I'm not, his credentials are substantial. But what puzzles me about it is, I mean, that
[36:02.600 --> 36:07.240]  kind of marks him for a dead man, doesn't I mean, they're not, they're either going
[36:07.240 --> 36:11.320]  to ignore him or they're going to kill him. I mean, while he is well connected as he's
[36:11.320 --> 36:17.080]  been in government, seems to me he would know that if he says something like that, he's
[36:17.080 --> 36:21.320]  going to have an accident before anybody takes him up on the offer. I mean, that strikes
[36:21.320 --> 36:32.920]  me as reckless almost. I mean, what I've been really puzzled about why he would say that.
[36:32.920 --> 36:40.640]  I mean, I can understand revealing it, but not, you know, not forecasting that he was
[36:40.640 --> 36:46.120]  going to reveal it. That's one thing they won't let be revealed. They're not going to let
[36:46.120 --> 36:47.120]  that happen.
[36:47.120 --> 36:51.720]  Exactly. I mean, Alex asked him about that. Alex was trying to get him on air to say,
[36:51.720 --> 36:57.080]  you know, I'm not suicidal, like the DC madam. And obviously we know what happened to her.
[36:57.080 --> 37:02.960]  But Pocenic basically said, you know, I'm a professional. I've got dirt on them. And
[37:02.960 --> 37:07.560]  he was basically not afraid of that. But he's actually coming up as a guest at the top of
[37:07.560 --> 37:14.760]  the hour. And that's something I can press him further on in the next hour of the show.
[37:14.760 --> 37:20.960]  My question, my question for you, Mr. Roberts, is you wrote on Monday that the whole Bin
[37:20.960 --> 37:27.240]  Laden thing had, quote, the order of a staged event. Now you've been justified in that assessment
[37:27.240 --> 37:34.400]  with these situation room photos that the media told us were an account of Obama and
[37:34.400 --> 37:40.520]  Hillary Clinton watching the live assassination of Bin Laden unfold. That has now been documented
[37:40.520 --> 37:44.880]  to be completely fraudulent. The live video stream was cut off. They saw nothing of the
[37:44.880 --> 37:51.200]  raid. You've you've wrote this other article today, which is excellent. What what do you
[37:51.200 --> 37:55.520]  think are the most alarming discrepancies in this whole Bin Laden narrative that we've
[37:55.520 --> 37:59.960]  been sold on by the White House and the media?
[37:59.960 --> 38:08.640]  Well, you know, Paul, the thing was never believable in the beginning because the first
[38:08.640 --> 38:19.880]  the original story of a firefight with the heroic seals taking on Al Qaeda, which Rumsfeld
[38:19.880 --> 38:25.800]  described as the most highly trained, the most dangerous, most vicious killers on the
[38:25.800 --> 38:32.480]  planet. And so they get the seals get into a firefight with these vicious, highly trained
[38:32.480 --> 38:38.920]  killers, and they don't get a scratch. So that already tells you if something stinks
[38:38.920 --> 38:45.360]  because you anybody can hear a helicopter coming, you know, even even people are asleep.
[38:45.360 --> 38:57.840]  So then before 48 hours past, the whole story changes fundamentally. There's no firefight.
[38:57.840 --> 39:03.520]  Bin Laden's not a coward after all, hiding behind a woman. He's not even armed, says
[39:03.520 --> 39:10.280]  the White House press spokesman, the direct quote. He wasn't armed. And so all of a sudden
[39:10.280 --> 39:19.520]  we go from heroes in a firefight to cold blooded murderers. And even worse, even if
[39:19.520 --> 39:25.200]  you believe the government story, you have to see it as the most botched operation in
[39:25.200 --> 39:31.160]  history. So why in the world would you kill the mastermind who has all the secrets of
[39:31.160 --> 39:38.800]  terrorism when he's unarmed, harmless and surrounded? That's the last thing you would
[39:38.800 --> 39:48.480]  do is to kill him. And so that part of the story is not so much a discrepancy that's
[39:48.480 --> 39:56.960]  important. It's the story itself. It makes no sense. And the reason they had to say
[39:56.960 --> 40:01.640]  that is they didn't capture him. They didn't kill him. He wasn't there. He was already
[40:01.640 --> 40:10.000]  dead. This is a staged event for a bunch of hidden agendas, not merely for Obama's popularity
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.960]  and poll ratings and reelection campaign. That's no doubt part of it. But there are
[40:14.960 --> 40:21.080]  other agendas that this event is being used for. For example, the justification of torture
[40:21.080 --> 40:29.400]  is one. Probably starting more trouble with Pakistan is another. More powers for homeland
[40:29.400 --> 40:37.440]  security is another. Probably more false flag attacks that they will say is due to al-Qaeda
[40:37.440 --> 40:42.880]  retaliation for killing bin Laden. There are all kinds of agendas that are hiding behind
[40:42.880 --> 40:56.440]  this, this false story. So the dead giveaway is that if you actually did catch this guy,
[40:56.440 --> 41:03.160]  you wouldn't quickly throw the evidence of your success into the ocean. The minute you
[41:03.160 --> 41:09.600]  do that, the whole story becomes suspect because there's no real explanation for why they dumped
[41:09.600 --> 41:16.360]  the body in the ocean. The story they give is obviously a fabrication and it's incorrect
[41:16.360 --> 41:22.520]  that they were giving him a quick burial in keeping with Muslim practices. This has been
[41:22.520 --> 41:27.280]  challenged by the Muslim demons, they say, that you're supposed to be buried in the
[41:27.280 --> 41:33.040]  ground with the head pointed toward Mecca and that the only excuse for dumping somebody
[41:33.040 --> 41:39.800]  at sea is if it's a very long voyage and the body is decomposing. And so every aspect
[41:39.800 --> 41:48.200]  of the story is phony. There's nothing true about any of it. And the other great puzzle
[41:48.200 --> 41:54.000]  Paul is why did they change the story? If you're going to pull off something like this,
[41:54.000 --> 42:00.000]  you've got to know what the story is and stick with it. And yet before 48 hours passes, the
[42:00.000 --> 42:08.360]  whole story has changed fundamentally. Why? What was the pressure to change the story?
[42:08.360 --> 42:13.320]  They didn't have to worry about Pakistan ratting on them. Pakistan is enough of an American
[42:13.320 --> 42:20.720]  public puppet that if it was ordered to shut up, it would shut up. I mean, Pakistan lets
[42:20.720 --> 42:28.720]  the United States conduct illegal military actions on its territory, killing its citizens.
[42:28.720 --> 42:33.720]  Pakistan lets the United States Army send the Pakistani army into tribal areas into
[42:33.720 --> 42:42.200]  entire provinces, displacing entire populations of people. If Washington tells Pakistan, hey,
[42:42.200 --> 42:45.240]  we're going to stage this thing and we want your help and you better not say anything
[42:45.240 --> 42:53.960]  about it, they're going to cooperate. So the real question is why did the story change?
[42:53.960 --> 43:01.560]  What's going on? Are people in the government now, I'm just speculating, I have no idea,
[43:01.560 --> 43:06.160]  are people in the government now seeing, they don't want Obama, some of them don't want
[43:06.160 --> 43:14.560]  Obama again. And they see that he's managed to do this to boost his poll ratings by 24%.
[43:14.560 --> 43:17.920]  So now they're going to undermine it because they want to get rid of him or they really
[43:17.920 --> 43:23.320]  have a different puppet or something, all kinds of things are going on that we don't
[43:23.320 --> 43:30.800]  know about. And that might explain why the administration, the government is destroying
[43:30.800 --> 43:38.800]  its own story. It's not being destroyed by news people. The news people are still celebrating
[43:38.800 --> 43:50.600]  the victory over Bin Laden. And the news people have given the imprimatur to extralegal murder
[43:50.600 --> 43:58.520]  of unarmed people. So it's not the news media who's exposed, it's the government itself
[43:58.520 --> 44:03.360]  that keeps changing the story and where's the pressure coming from to change the story?
[44:03.360 --> 44:14.200]  I mean, why create such massive credibility problems for the government's own story? So
[44:14.200 --> 44:21.240]  maybe all the people inside the government are fighting each other over who they want
[44:21.240 --> 44:25.400]  to run the next time. I don't know what's going on, but that's the biggest puzzle to
[44:25.400 --> 44:34.640]  me. Maybe somebody on your desk and maybe Steve today can throw some light on that.
[44:34.640 --> 44:40.640]  That is the most interesting question. So the two real questions, and I'll be finished
[44:40.640 --> 44:50.440]  here. One is what are the real agendas that this news event is designed to further? And
[44:50.440 --> 45:01.560]  two, why did the government wreck its own story by changing it before 48 hours are over without
[45:01.560 --> 45:06.640]  any obvious sources of pressure on them to change the story?
[45:06.640 --> 45:13.520]  It's amazing, I mean. The Kennedy story, the Kennedy was killed by Oswald period, and we've
[45:13.520 --> 45:18.000]  had that story now for what, 40, 50 years or something. They don't change it. Why did
[45:18.000 --> 45:22.440]  they change the story? They haven't changed the 9-11 story.
[45:22.440 --> 45:29.440]  Well, exactly. I mean, you've got the press secretary, Carney, who's now being lambasted
[45:29.440 --> 45:35.360]  by all sides of the media as this flounder, this failure, because he's having difficulty
[45:35.360 --> 45:40.120]  getting the fable straight. He keeps tripping over his words. He keeps giving contradictory
[45:40.120 --> 45:45.600]  explanations. And like you said, it's baffling. It's almost as if it's deliberately designed
[45:45.600 --> 45:51.280]  to look hokey. I mean, you've got neighbours surrounding this so-called compound, they say
[45:51.280 --> 45:57.240]  they'd never saw bin Laden. It's a stone's throw away from a Pakistani military base.
[45:57.240 --> 46:02.920]  All the residents have to have ID cards. They have to go through checkpoints to get anywhere.
[46:02.920 --> 46:07.760]  And the only photos that have been released are of these victims, because none of them
[46:07.760 --> 46:13.720]  are bin Laden. And it's increasingly starting to look like he was, I mean, we know that
[46:13.720 --> 46:18.160]  every intelligence professional worth their salt said that he's been dead for nine years.
[46:18.160 --> 46:25.200]  It's starting to look as if perhaps some members of the bin Laden family were there, and that's
[46:25.200 --> 46:30.240]  what they used as the reason to go in. But I mean, it's like in your article today, you
[46:30.240 --> 46:36.640]  quote this email that you received from a reader who asks why the government's so sloppy
[46:36.640 --> 46:42.040]  in its lies that it virtually makes no effort to make them appear credible. I mean, why
[46:42.040 --> 46:47.520]  are they so arrogant in their total disregard for the intellect of the American people?
[46:47.520 --> 46:53.080]  I think the answer to that ball is they got away with 9-11. They blew up two skyscrapers
[46:53.080 --> 46:58.760]  in plain view of everybody, in plain view of the TV cameras. We've got recordings all
[46:58.760 --> 47:02.840]  over the world of these buildings being blown up. Anybody that looks at those buildings
[47:02.840 --> 47:07.360]  can see they're being blown up. They're not falling down. These are not buildings falling
[47:07.360 --> 47:12.360]  down from structural damage from an airliner or fire. These buildings are blowing up. You
[47:12.360 --> 47:17.080]  can see they're blowing up. If they get away with that, if they can get away with the fable
[47:17.080 --> 47:23.240]  that a few Saudis with box cutters can outwear at all 16 American intelligence agencies,
[47:23.240 --> 47:30.120]  all the intelligence agencies of NATO, of Israel even, can outwear at NORAD, air traffic
[47:30.120 --> 47:37.440]  control, airport security four times in one morning, can cause the state of the art Pentagon
[47:37.440 --> 47:42.640]  air defenses to fail. Anybody can pull off this superhero stuff. How could anybody believe
[47:42.640 --> 47:50.440]  that? Did you see the film, V for Vendetta, where the superhero blows up the British
[47:50.440 --> 47:58.320]  parliament? Well, the 9-11 attack makes that look like nothing. And yet people fall for
[47:58.320 --> 48:06.560]  these things. I mean, so I guess that's the reason the government just shows it doesn't
[48:06.560 --> 48:13.520]  make any effort to even make a credible lie. It just knows that it can use a patriot card
[48:13.520 --> 48:18.760]  and 80% of the people will fall for it. The patriotism will, and they'll be, oh, we got
[48:18.760 --> 48:25.360]  him, we got the towel head. So that's what they rely on, I think. They don't think anybody
[48:25.360 --> 48:32.560]  is going to think about it. People are just going to celebrate. And if you start thinking
[48:32.560 --> 48:37.440]  about it, you have to give up celebrating, and they'd rather celebrate than be suspicious
[48:37.440 --> 48:44.400]  of their government. That's probably the answer. I thought that reader that you quoted
[48:44.400 --> 48:49.680]  made a very good point and raised the central question. That's why I put it in my article
[48:49.680 --> 48:57.720]  today. But I think that's the answer, Paul. They know, look, they've always got away with
[48:57.720 --> 49:07.160]  everything. Remember the main, the Gulf of Tonkin, weapons of mass destruction. Governments
[49:07.160 --> 49:12.520]  all over the world have got away with these things. Hitler got away with the Reichstag
[49:12.520 --> 49:19.760]  fire. They blamed it on the left wing or some deranged commie. These things are commonplace
[49:19.760 --> 49:27.600]  in history, and they always work. In fact, I wonder if there are any examples that didn't
[49:27.600 --> 49:32.800]  work. I can't think of any offhand. Maybe they are somewhere.
[49:32.800 --> 49:39.280]  Well, it's with everything, like you said. I mean, Operation Gladio, they got away with
[49:39.280 --> 49:45.920]  that as well. And I think it comes down to the fact that when people don't have time
[49:45.920 --> 49:51.280]  or don't have the effort to scratch the surface on these things, they just throw in their
[49:51.280 --> 49:56.120]  lot with the US government as if it's some kind of baseball team, like they scored a
[49:56.120 --> 50:04.020]  major victory. I mean, in the aftermath of the bombardment of Iraq, pizza and beer sales
[50:04.020 --> 50:10.080]  went through the roof, and it's kind of just this dumbing down, this reduction of what
[50:10.080 --> 50:15.400]  amounts in the end to the slaughter of thousands and millions of people to support in a baseball
[50:15.400 --> 50:21.200]  team or a football team. And that's the kind of post-911 mental castration that they're
[50:21.200 --> 50:26.320]  now trying to reinvigorate after this latest fraud.
[50:26.320 --> 50:36.880]  I think that must be it. But still, we'll remember now the two questions that we should
[50:36.880 --> 50:43.240]  focus on is what are the real agendas behind this theater? And two, why did the government
[50:43.240 --> 50:44.240]  change story?
[50:44.240 --> 51:00.520]  And we'll talk about that after the break with Paul Craig Roberts. Stay tuned.

[53:59.080 --> 54:24.880]  We're back. It's the Ike Jones Show Live with me, Paul Joseph Watson. Delighted to be joined
[54:24.880 --> 54:30.680]  by Paul Craig Roberts. We were talking about the agendas behind why they're contriving
[54:30.680 --> 54:37.280]  this bin Laden fable. Many have suggested that we had these reports a couple of weeks ago
[54:37.280 --> 54:43.280]  about the Pakistani government protesting about the US drone strike simply because of
[54:43.280 --> 54:48.520]  the fact that they've killed so many innocent people in Pakistan. We had the Prime Minister
[54:48.520 --> 54:54.160]  of Pakistan, Yusef Ranza Jilani saying, quote, these attacks are creating a lot of problems
[54:54.160 --> 54:59.240]  for us. The US will have to stop these attacks. And of course, there were massive protests
[54:59.240 --> 55:05.480]  in Pakistan about these drone strikes just days before this bin Laden fraud was rolled
[55:05.480 --> 55:12.080]  out. Pakistan is now being geopolitically isolated. They're saying that Pakistan was
[55:12.080 --> 55:17.520]  harboring bin Laden all along. Of course, that only means that so was the CIA. It's
[55:17.520 --> 55:23.220]  tied with the Pakistani ISI at the hip. Those are the two organizations that created bin
[55:23.220 --> 55:28.680]  Laden as a terrorist leader in the first place. So a lot of people are suggesting that it's
[55:28.680 --> 55:34.760]  a kind of reprisal against Pakistan for their unwillingness to continue going along with
[55:34.760 --> 55:41.160]  this support in the hegemony of the US empire. I want to get your comments on that, but I
[55:41.160 --> 55:49.920]  also want to turn to Libya. We had the NATO spokesman, James Apathory, two days ago say,
[55:49.920 --> 55:56.400]  well, the UN Security Council should adopt a new resolution on Libya. Resolution 1973
[55:56.400 --> 56:03.040]  does not envisage land operations. We need a new resolution. So Dr. Roberts, it seems
[56:03.040 --> 56:08.240]  that NATO and the UN are basically going back on everything they promised when this bombardment
[56:08.240 --> 56:14.720]  started. They're now talking about ground troops. How long do you think ground troops
[56:14.720 --> 56:20.880]  until ground troops are sent in? And why has Libya been targeted for regime change amongst
[56:20.880 --> 56:26.880]  all this? Okay, Paul, first question about did they concoct
[56:26.880 --> 56:35.160]  the bin Laden death to shut up Pakistan? No, but no doubt they saw that is also another
[56:35.160 --> 56:41.800]  useful gain of it, but they wouldn't have organized it for that purpose. When you organize
[56:41.800 --> 56:51.160]  something like this, all sorts of agendas can get hooked onto it. And you can see them
[56:51.160 --> 56:54.600]  sitting around the table and somebody says, well, this will also let us put pressure on
[56:54.600 --> 57:04.960]  Pakistan. We'll blame them, blah, blah. And often what happens is the people who concocted
[57:04.960 --> 57:09.960]  for the real agenda, perhaps it was Obama wanting to get reelected or boost him. You
[57:09.960 --> 57:17.360]  see, here's what Obama was faced with. He was sinking in the polls. And so the question
[57:17.360 --> 57:24.480]  was whether he would all of a sudden be faced with challenges for the nomination. See, that's
[57:24.480 --> 57:29.680]  the last thing a sitting president wants. He wants to be re-nominated without having
[57:29.680 --> 57:36.600]  to go through a primary of his own. But if he's sinking in the polls at a time that's
[57:36.600 --> 57:46.040]  getting close enough to the presidential campaign itself, then he has to worry about
[57:46.040 --> 57:54.120]  all the money getting behind another candidate. So if he can boost his popularity long enough
[57:54.120 --> 58:02.320]  to make it too difficult for a last minute challenge to come up. So that's one good reason
[58:02.320 --> 58:11.080]  for Obama to have done this. And it's probably the lead reason that he did it, that it was
[58:11.080 --> 58:23.280]  done to get rid of any challenge to him as the Democratic presidential nominee. Now,
[58:23.280 --> 58:28.200]  you can also give him a benefit of the doubt, look at it the other way. And you can say,
[58:28.200 --> 58:32.640]  well, look, he's finally don't know him, maybe a few of his policymakers, that the
[58:32.640 --> 58:36.800]  doll is sinking. Okay, we're going to have to leave it there out of time. We'll talk
[58:36.800 --> 58:46.120]  about Libya next time. Thanks, Paul Craig. Robert, stay tuned. This is GCN, the Genesis

[59:53.440 --> 01:00:05.240]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:13.920]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he. He's Alex
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:23.880]  Jones on the GCM Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:28.000]  Second hour of the Alex Jones show, we're going a million miles an hour today because
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.200]  we've got so many guests, so many different hosts. We've got Steve Watson coming up at
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:37.600]  the bottom of the hour. And then we're going to be hosted by Aaron Dykes. Of course, Alex
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:43.720]  Jones is going to call in later on with an update. He's on the road at the moment.
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:50.840]  We're joined by Steve R. Pachennick, whose revelations this week have prompted one of
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:56.600]  the biggest reactions we've ever had from a guest. The listeners have been completely
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:01.400]  blown away with what they've heard. Steve Pachennick, of course, Deputy Assistant Secretary
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:09.240]  under three different administrations, also worked in the Reagan and Bush senior administrations.
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:14.480]  Top spy master terrorist hunter for the US government wrote the book on psychological
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:19.680]  warfare and counter-terrorism for the State Department. And of course, dropped the bombshell
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:24.800]  this week on the Alex Jones show that Osama bin Laden has been dead for the best part
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:31.280]  of a decade since late 2001. Dr. Pachennick, great to have you back on the show today.
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:37.240]  Oh, it's always a pleasure. And I want to thank you and Alex Jones for bringing me
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:42.760]  on. I want to thank the audience for listening to me. It's very kind of them. And again,
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:50.280]  this is something that we go back over a decade. It's very rare to have a host like Alex Jones.
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:55.840]  We had the bravery to bring me on 10 years ago, right after 9-11, when I pronounced not
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:02.320]  only was 9-11 a false black and stand-down operation, which most Americans now realize.
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:09.680]  But at the same time, part of the whole scenario, the Syops war that was created by Bush junior
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:14.880]  and before that Clinton, quite frankly, because he was involved, was the fact that Osama bin
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:20.320]  Laden had been diagnosed with Marfan syndrome. Many of your people can look it up. It's called
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:27.920]  M-A-R-S-A-N where the life span is very short. And one of the consequences is arterial fracture
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:33.240]  and all kinds of side effects, but primarily renal dialysis with a very short life span.
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:39.680]  And Alex talked about it yesterday. And at the time that 9-11 occurred, he was eminently
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:44.280]  dying. And then by the time Torobor came in, he was already dead. So when I went on the
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:51.200]  air nine, 10 years ago, and Alex was kind enough to invite me, I said, look, Osama bin
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:59.240]  Laden is dead. The issue of why we use Osama bin Laden is basically a story narrative that
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:06.440]  the intelligence community, usually the CIA and civilians, not often the military, although
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:12.760]  the military is literally separated out at this point. Many of my own men I work with
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:18.520]  in special forces, not the Navy, but the Army, particularly in the Army intelligence, have
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:24.080]  really been watching this. And I must admit that we have, I have full respect for our
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:30.240]  military. I myself was a colonel at 32 and refused promotion at 39. But my point being
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:35.000]  that there was a narrative that was developed in order for the United States to go into
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.920]  a so-called war on terrorism, which is an oxymoron because terrorism is not a war. It's
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:47.760]  a tactic. It's not a strategy. And that narrative was carried forth with all kinds of story
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:52.760]  lines that made no sense, including Osama bin Laden was supposed to be the bad guy.
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:58.160]  And that's why we went in there and we would pursue him and continue the war in Iraq and
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:03.480]  Afghanistan for reasons that were unclear to everybody, except that we were killing Al-Qaeda
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:07.000]  members. But it turned out that the Al-Qaeda members we were killing were the people we
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:12.120]  trained in the beginning when I was involved in the Carter administration under Brzezinski
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:16.000]  and then followed through in various other administrations. They came out, some of them
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:22.400]  from special forces, others from other divisions of the military, and were trained in Brooklyn
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:27.600]  and elsewhere. And they were put in as Moussakhideen, as most of the Americans know. And then
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:33.480]  eventually the storyline went as the Bush administration created with the Keneopons,
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:41.040]  while Wolfowitz in particular, Azal-Mehalasad, Elliot Abrams, Condoleezza Rice, Richard Cheney,
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:46.560]  all of the eventually returning criminals and liars as we found out that there was no weapons
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:52.600]  of mass destruction. And suddenly, not only did we have one villain, Osama bin Laden, who
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:57.320]  already been dead in this narrative. We'll talk about it after the break. Stay there.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:04.320]  We'll be right back with Steve Arpojenik.
[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:34.320]  We'll be right back with Steve Arpojenik.
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:07.840]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road. But if the
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:35.840]  unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:46.320]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:50.920]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:58.080]  ride all day with confidence. Order yours at gusset.com. Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.080]  Others don't.
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:04.720]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:09.080]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:13.400]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:18.480]  allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:23.120]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:28.760]  is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:33.080]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:37.200]  of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:41.520]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:45.840]  in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:08.720]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:12.720]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:20.680]  Well, live, it's the Alex Jones show. We're talking to Steve R. Pachennick, top spy masterworks
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:27.400]  under five U.S. administrations. Dr. Pachennick, I was talking in the last half hour to the
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:34.360]  former Assistant Treasury Secretary under Reagan, Paul Craig Roberts. He was, of course, fascinated
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:39.880]  by the statement you made earlier this week, the fact that a top general under Wolfowitz
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:44.920]  told you directly that 9-11 was a false flag and that you were prepared to go in front
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:51.320]  of a federal committee to reveal that name. Roberts was wanting to know how you're not
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:57.760]  concerned about your safety while withholding that kind of explosive information, so can
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.680]  you elaborate on that for us?
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:05.920]  I'd be happy to explain it. Number one, most of the people who were involved in the false
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:13.120]  flag and stand down understand what it is I really did over 20 to 30 years. I was what
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:18.760]  you call a solo operant and worked all over the world. I didn't work for the CIA. I worked
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:24.240]  directly for the president of the Secretary of State and I did regime change to that gentleman
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:30.640]  and others understand what I do and I won't go into detail. They don't really have to
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:35.960]  go into understanding how I do it, but they do understand every one of the neocons knows
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:43.560]  me exceedingly well. Remember, I had worked with Cheney and Rumsfeld before under the
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:48.880]  Nixon administration. I didn't personally know them and Rumsfeld was a grand corporation,
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:52.400]  but I had worked with all the neocons and they weren't allowed under the Bush senior
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:57.880]  administration, so the issue of my safety is not really the issue. I'm just like any
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:03.360]  other American citizen who served our country and I said, you know, it's enough. I was
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:10.120]  colonel at 32. I was promoted through Brigadier at 37 or 39. I refused that. I didn't go in
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:15.200]  full time. I went out to become what every American citizen is as an entrepreneur and
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:20.040]  basically wanted to live my life as I wanted to and make the mistakes that I could and
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:26.280]  criticize the administration while being able to serve it and I volunteer still to serve
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:31.160]  our military and I'm very proud of that. I won't go into the details and I don't ask
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:35.920]  for money and I never have and don't receive a pension, but it's a very clear understanding
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:39.840]  that your American public should understand that if somebody doesn't step forward, I'm
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:45.640]  no more a hero than a mechanic, a truck driver, anyone else and I'm saying this is enough
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:50.720]  and I don't worry for my life. My life has been at risk serving my country, I don't know,
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:55.680]  eight, nine different times from the Middle East to the East Asia to Cambodia with the
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:04.000]  Khmer Rouge with the Red Brigade with PFLP and so I think those who know what I'm saying
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  understand that this could be a mutual assured destruction if anything really happened to
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:17.640]  me and it would really not be very good for anyone to consider even thinking about terminating
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:22.800]  me because it's not an issue. I mean I don't need to threaten anybody, everybody understands
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:27.600]  in the business what I do and what I've done and it would be best for everybody just to
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:33.280]  cool it and allow an American citizen to say exactly what he wants to say, to criticize
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:39.000]  a president who's not qualified to really be in this position at this point in time
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:46.880]  who has maintained a narrative that's totally deceptive, false, a lie and basically the
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:52.720]  issue is those who are involved in this deception and in 9-11, they're not going to get away
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:59.200]  with it. They have to understand that the American public will not allow the unresolved
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:04.840]  issues of 9-11 to go away as you've seen even a decade later thanks to people like yourself
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:09.600]  and Alex Jones and the wonderful, wonderful people who are listening to this, the radio
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:14.960]  broadcast. I don't see myself as any particular hero or whether there's a death threat, that's
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:20.920]  fine. I mean I do what I do without the concept that they're going to kill me or I'm going
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:26.880]  to disappear and that's unfortunate for most people because I feel like the Jeffersonian
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:32.360]  doctrine which is every generation has to fight for their own democracy. So I'm blessed
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:39.120]  to be in a country where at the same time I can serve Nixon, Reagan, Bush, Ford, Carter
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:44.760]  and Bush senior who I admire immensely and at the same time be able to criticize his
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:50.880]  son who I thought was totally incompetent and totally dangerous Bush Jr. and now I see
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:55.280]  that there's a sequel to that and that is Obama. It doesn't matter to me whether you're
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:13:02.280]  a Republican, Democrat, Independent or any other spectrum of the policy but you cannot,
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:08.440]  I repeat, you cannot continue to have a PSYOPS operation on the American public that wants
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:16.160]  to justify the increased popularity and self-aggrandizement of a president like either Bush Jr. or Obama
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:23.160]  and he uses that to manipulate the public without telling the truth and then gets confabulate
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:30.840]  stories about an attack where a man was already dead and had a confrontation which never existed
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:35.560]  and an intelligence community that backed it up and knows fully well that they have
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:40.200]  deceived and lied to the American public. It's important that your audience understands
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:49.200]  at this present point terrorism has become such a big business that we have over 850,000
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:54.840]  people involved around the Washington area and the military industrial complex making
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:14:00.800]  and top secret relations which is absurd. We have PSA that has really never done anything
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:07.480]  to prevent or protract safety and what's important to understand at this point right now for
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:12.480]  the public. We have been safe for over 30 to 40 years. Nothing and no one has ever attacked
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:17.920]  the United States. The only people who attacked the United States was George Bush, Cheney
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:25.160]  and Rumsfeld. So the nonsense that since 9-11 we have been safe is an absolute lie. It's
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:31.520]  a continuous lie and those who believe it are continuously deceiving the American public.
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:36.800]  If anything else, it has become worse. We've exacerbated our relationship with the Pakistani
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:41.880]  government, the Pakistani military which I have worked with under Yahoo Khan and the
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:46.240]  very through intelligence operatives who can have the access or have the access that I've
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:51.480]  had including with the fundamentalist, Islamic fundamentalist who went to school with me
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:59.040]  and at the same time we have become an increasingly police state which is exacerbating our economy
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:04.240]  or the fact that we are going down in our living standards, the fact that people have
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:10.120]  to have double jobs, there are no jobs available and this president all he cares about is garnering
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:16.240]  a billion dollars to re-elect himself in another narrative which was totally delusional. So
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:22.120]  the problem now isn't about me. I'm not a more a hero than any American who says, look
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:26.480]  this is enough. I'm not going to take this anymore. But I didn't expect 10 years later
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:33.480]  for another delusionary pandera called the president, a politician, whether you're a
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:40.600]  Republican or Democrat, to continue this nonsensical story that we have been attacked by Muslims
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:46.800]  which we hadn't been. We were attacked by our own people in a false flag operation and
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:52.760]  the point of the Osama bin Laden resurrection is this is the psychological resurrection.
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:57.600]  If the SEALs attacked anything then they're going to have to explain to me who's been
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:02.600]  in intelligence for a long time and works with special forces, not the SEALs primarily,
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:07.720]  how they attacked the mortuary because he's dead and he was dead for nine to ten years
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:12.640]  and there are others who can confirm that. The issue at hand now is still more important.
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:20.320]  We have to stop this government and other governments from continuing to deceive, deny
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:26.040]  and continuously manipulate the American public. That's why Alex Jones is so important in
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:31.840]  your radio show. They can call us conspirators. I don't care. That's an incredible, easy
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:35.840]  way for the intelligence community, which is not very effective by the way. Let me give
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:42.760]  you another little statistic. 80% of the CIA now are composed of mercenaries. In the days
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:49.320]  that I worked under Reagan, Bush and Bush Sr. in particular, we had real heroes, men
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:53.720]  who had really served our countries and worked on the Cold War. They were an interesting
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:17:00.240]  in self-aggrandizement. They were an interesting in promoting SEAL 6. No special forces unit
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:04.960]  that I have worked with, including Delta and other units in hostage negotiation. In the
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:10.000]  Army particularly, has ever come forth and said how great I am and let me show you how
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.680]  great I am. It is unfortunate that the Navy has a proclivity, including under Admiral
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:19.800]  Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, whose father happens to have been a
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:26.000]  publicist for my talent agency, William Morris, and has a proclivity for self-aggrandizement
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:31.240]  because he made a real faux pas by giving the Medal of Honor to Greg Mortensen, another
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:37.600]  sociopath who claimed he went into Pakistan and built schools all over. He has a proclivity
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:43.560]  to dramatize a unit that has had a questionable history of effectiveness, the SEALs. When
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:49.320]  I was involved in under Reagan, the SEALs were lost on a raft, six of them, four to
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:54.880]  six of them on an assault to Grenada. Now you explain that to me, but every movie I
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:18:00.840]  have seen and your public has ever seen who aggrandizes and self-aggrandizes the SEAL
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:06.680]  unit, including Demi Moore's film, G.I. Jane, and other films, but the units I worked with
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:15.520]  and had a consult to, you will never know about. They are dedicated, quiet men and women
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:22.480]  who have been intellectually exceedingly perceptive, very highly trained, and their
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:26.480]  job is to do their job, keep it quiet, and go home.
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:32.160]  And we're talking about great generals like General Petraeus and other generals who really
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:38.480]  have served our country, but you don't hear them going out and creating this fantasy of
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:44.120]  how they went in there and attacked a man who was out and wasn't armed, who is dead
[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:49.320]  but isn't dead, but now is floating in the water. So I warn the Navy, and particularly
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:54.280]  in the chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, the best he can do, Mullen, is to resign now,
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:19:00.040]  and the same thing with Panetta. You're not qualified to run the CIA or the military, Secretary
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:05.080]  of Defense, and I warn the President of the United States cease and desist this nonsensical
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:11.360]  story and stop calling the American people conspirator and marginalizing us by telling
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:17.240]  us what he wants to hear, because the truth of the matter is the more he says things that
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:23.600]  are absurd and contradictory, the more he's going to expose himself to people like myself
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:28.480]  and others about his own questionable background. I'm not talking about his birth there. He
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:33.960]  knows he has a very questionable history, and he's treading on very dangerous waters
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:39.160]  when you come into the world of Cyah in a world where guys like me and others who I
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:44.200]  work with are really professional. I don't go out in public. I don't need to have my
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:49.400]  picture taken. I don't need to have a uniform, and I don't have to be interviewed every 30
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:54.280]  seconds to say how great I am like this. Okay, we'll be back to talk more about it after
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:20:23.280]  the break with Dr. Steve Picernic. Don't go away. This is the Alex Jones Show Live.

[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:34.120]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:38.960]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:43.520]  won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:50.280]  yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:56.200]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns call 800-686-2237. Secure
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:22:02.800]  your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:07.640]  Alex Jones here with key information. The US government is a Ponzi scheme that relies
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:12.040]  on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:18.280]  banks. With Japan about to become a seller of US bonds in order to rebuild its own nation
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:23.240]  and the US antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators, the Federal Reserve
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:29.240]  which is already buying about 70% of US Treasuries will soon be the only buyer left of US Treasuries.
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:33.640]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the US Dollar will soon become
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:38.520]  worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes and savings destroyed.
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:47.120]  I strongly urge my fellow Americans to sign up for the free NIA newsletter at www.inflation.us.
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:51.080]  If you are sick and tired of the economic propaganda and the mainstream media sign up
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:59.960]  for free at inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:05.560]  The US economy is at a tipping point. 40 cents of every dollar the government spends is borrowed.
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:09.640]  The President of the Federal Reserve in Dallas was recently quoted saying this path will
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:14.320]  lead to insolvency resulting in the collapse of our government and our economy.
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:18.200]  Our country can't function like this and neither can your household. That's why you
[01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:23.240]  need to prepare and priority one is your food supply. Fortunately, it's easy and affordable
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:27.160]  with the help of Ready Reserve Foods. Ready Reserve Foods has been a premier supplier

[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:21.680]  We're back live on the Alex Jones sale May 5th, 2011, talking to Dr. Steve Pacenik who
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:28.720]  has been completely vindicated. The situation room photos were staged. Obama and Hillary
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:33.960]  did not watch the Bin Laden raid. Obama lied Sunday night on national television when he
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:39.440]  told Americans that he did. I want to get your take on that, Steve. And also, we don't
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:45.160]  have much time. Just one more question. On Sunday, Obama said America was safer because
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:50.760]  of this stage Bin Laden fable. They've ramped up the police state. They're talking about
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:55.840]  putting the terror level up a notch. How much danger are we in of them staging another
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:59.360]  false flag inside America within the next few weeks?
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:04.000]  Well, I don't want to say they're going to create a false flag. What he's done is when
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.760]  you lie, you continuously lie. So he will lie to create in order to maintain this lie,
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:15.880]  he will increase what looks like the presence of counterterrorist people, TSA and cops and
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:20.480]  all. But the reality, the only thing that's effective in terrorism and counterterrorism
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:25.520]  over 30 years is human intelligence. And he doesn't have that. And the CIA doesn't have
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:30.560]  that because 80% of them on contract. The ones who have it on the military, usually
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:35.080]  the army, some elements of the air force. So I'm not worried. If they pulled another
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:39.320]  false flag, we're going to have a revolution in America. And he knows that he will understand
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:44.560]  that intelligence community will understand that will precipitate violence in this country.
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:49.960]  And I warn the intelligence community that's listening now and the military do not even
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:55.280]  think of creating another false flag because that will be the beginning of the second American
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:26:00.720]  revolution. That will be the beginning where really the American public that is allowed
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:06.600]  to have guns will really understand that this country is out of control. So now I am warning
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:10.400]  the president of the United States who is not the brightest individual in the world
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:15.240]  and who is also not very competent in his job. But if you want to get reelected, you
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:19.960]  best get reelected by understanding what the office is. It's to serve the public. It's
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:25.320]  not to serve your own grandeur and your own narcissism. It's to serve the American public.
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:30.120]  And by increasing the so-called security, you're creating more and more trouble. You've created
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:35.000]  more trouble by men and women or honorable men and women who've gotten fought and died
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:40.880]  for this nonsense so that you can get reelected. Our veterans coming back without any benefits
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:46.280]  because you are not able to supply them and you cannot get reelected on the bodies of
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:52.520]  the American people and on their welfare. So I warn you repeatedly, if you think I am
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:59.000]  just full of air, you better look at my history again on regime change. It will be very easy
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.720]  to initiate a regime change with you, Mr. President, everyone around the intelligence
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:08.160]  community. If you want to come forth, I'll be happy to discuss it with you. But I believe
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:13.280]  the President, number one, is too cowardly, number two, not too bright, and his lying
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:15.800]  will be the undoing of his presidency.
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:21.320]  Dr. Picernic, about these stage photos, I mean, you said they were staged. Now it's
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:24.200]  come out that they were. What do you have to say about that?
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:29.120]  Well, you know, being right is not good in my life because I'm a physician. If I tell
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:33.880]  you you have cancer, it's not, I'm not proud to say that you have cancer. Believe me, I
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:38.640]  have no great satisfaction in saying nine years later that the American public has been
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:43.680]  duped again. But I'm warning those who are creating this story, including the intelligence
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:53.120]  community, 850,000 people involved in counterterrorism, beware of what you do. You will be held accountable.
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:58.920]  The American public will hold you accountable. There are myself and others who understand
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:05.480]  exactly who you are, what you are doing, do not mess with the American public. And that's
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:10.840]  my warning. There will be more deceptions, more lies. But if you increase your TSA, you
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:16.760]  increase your security, you will weaken the fibers of our democracy, and that will begin
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:20.960]  the Second American Revolution. And if they don't understand that, they better look at
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:29.000]  what happened to the neocons, to Scooter Libby, and to many others. So you better understand
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:34.480]  once again, I have not given you a false threat. I am threatening you again on behalf of the
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:40.880]  Americans as an American, do not play with American security, freedom, and the right
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:48.440]  to protest. That will be the demise of your institution. And Obama, you cannot keep lying.
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:56.080]  Your lying will undo this presidency and will undo the fabric of our society. So be careful.
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:29:00.400]  Your sociopathy got you to the presidency, but will not keep you in the presidency.
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:01.400]  That was my final word.
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:07.560]  Dr. Steve Pchenick, we're out of time. We've got to leave it there. We're out of time. Really
[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:13.160]  appreciate you spending time with us, and we'll be sure to have you back on the show.
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:18.920]  There goes Dr. Steve Pchenick with more astounding revelations on the Alex Jones show, and I'm
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:25.440]  sure that he'll be back on the air very shortly. Steve Watson, Aaron Dykes, and Alex Jones
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:30.000]  are coming up to host the last hour and a half. I've been Paul Joseph Watson. Be sure

[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:51.040]  I'm signing off. Stay tuned for more after the break.
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:59.080]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:06.480]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones. I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings,
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:11.680]  opportunity, and recognized risk. Saving means to make money. The Calben Pure Soap Company

[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:33.080]  risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and a
[01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:37.200]  deteriorating clothing called lint. If you want something better, if you want something
[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:41.520]  you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before. Getting a free catalog

[01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:06.400]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:11.920]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:16.720]  from underneath the Americans at home. I've turned a tremendous influence on our president
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:21.920]  in Congress, and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of
[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:27.560]  us as American citizens to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of
[01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:33.000]  our nation, the criminal off-short cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty, and on
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:38.000]  its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists are asking
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:42.200]  for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to? Today seems
[01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:48.960]  like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:55.040]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right

[01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:04.720]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:09.880]  and disasters in unprecedented numbers. People have had to literally run for their lives.
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:14.360]  Folks, this is Steve Shank with E-Foods Direct. I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:19.160]  strikes, you won't have time to think. You must act automatically. What does a pilot
[01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:24.320]  do when the helicopter engine fails in flight? No time to think, just act automatically.
[01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:29.200]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:34.080]  to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need. You need a five-day
[01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:39.360]  extreme emergency kit. With serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:46.840]  days, this powerful $300 extreme emergency kit is free with an order of at least $995
[01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:55.480]  from E-Foods Direct. Go to efoodsdirect.com slash alex or call 800-409-5633. That's efoodsdirect.com
[01:32:55.480 --> 01:33:22.440]  slash alex 800-409-5633. This is the Alex Jones show. We're playing
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:31.240]  past the bat on here today with hosts. Alex is away on business. You just heard Paul Joseph
[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:39.160]  Watson interviewing Steve Pechenick. I'm Steve Watson, another of Alex's principal webmasters.
[01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:45.240]  In the third hour, we've got Aaron Dykes coming up to present some deep research that he's
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:52.040]  been working on, which is always interesting to hear. But today we're talking, obviously,
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:34:01.400]  the hot topic as President Obama grandstands at ground zero, reaping the political benefits
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:09.120]  of Osama bin Laden just as President Bush did before him. So we're going to get into
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:16.800]  a bit of the history of the mythical figure bin Laden, who he is, where he's come from
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:25.440]  and how he's going to be still an icon to be used by the establishment in the future.
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:33.400]  Obviously the facts are getting lost in a froth of false vindication and faux patriotism
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:41.120]  that has arisen this week since the announcement on Sunday. But it's obviously key to break
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:48.920]  this down to understand why this is fundamentally and permanently altered our society for the
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:55.920]  worse. So we got the notion of the sort of bad guy. We got him good triumphs over evil
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:03.600]  and this idea that our governments represent our own sense of morality, which is obviously
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:09.400]  a complete theatre. It's just simply not reflective of reality and the way the world
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:16.400]  actually works. And, you know, anyone who actually believes that is either badly misinformed
[01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:25.520]  or completely naive. So as the listeners of this show and many more people are aware,
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:35.400]  the origins of bin Laden traces back to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, where
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:42.120]  he was, him and the Mujahideen were trained and funded by the CIA and the Pentagon Intelligence
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:48.960]  Services. So rather than lingering on that, we'll move on to some other examples of how
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:59.880]  bin Laden's been used by the establishment to forward this idea of the buggy man, the
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:07.120]  terror mastermind. But first, it's important to check out the interviews that Alex has
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:13.000]  conducted over the past week with Steve Pacenek and the interview that we've just heard.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:22.520]  Because there are people at the moment, detractors, who are just simply seem to be immune to facts
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:30.080]  and evidence. And these articles and these interviews of this people like Pacenek, someone
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:34.360]  who's served under five presidents at the highest levels of government, it's important
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:43.000]  to get these out to people, you know, to show, to present the evidence. Because, for example,
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:50.800]  earlier this week, Alex was on TalksBort, UK radio, and callers were calling in as he
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:55.920]  was giving out all the evidence, quote, in the experts. And just simply, they were simply
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:37:00.520]  not hearing what he was saying. They were saying he had, all he had was a website and
[01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:08.040]  maybe a YouTube video of himself saying these things. And that's a good clip to, that's
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:12.320]  a good clip to a good interview to get out to people, the TalksBort one. It's on the
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:17.320]  Alex Jones channel, the YouTube channel, because it shows that there's a kind of cognitive
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:25.080]  dissonance going on. There's a kind of divide that's being driven by this faux patriotism
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:33.080]  that we have to, we have to overcome. The idea that, the idea that bin Laden was killed
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:38.440]  in this, in this hovel, which the media, for some reason, referred to as a million dollar
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:45.880]  mansion at first, we've got staged photographs flying around, we've got, you know, even if
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:51.920]  they do release a video or a photo, it's too late because they've already released a load
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:58.520]  of nonsense over the past decade, fake bin Laden videos, recycled, rehashed material.
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:03.080]  It's important to get these key articles out to people to explain, to get through this
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:09.040]  cognitive dissonance, this holding two ideas in the head at the same time that conflicts,
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:14.480]  because you've got this group of people who are almost violently patriotic at the moment
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:22.440]  with this announcement. It's a kind of psychological resurrection of the buggy man bin Laden figure.
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:28.480]  And it's very difficult to get through to them without, without getting these key facts
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:31.760]  and the words of these experts out to them, because at the end of the day, we're just
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:37.600]  people on camera or on the radio telling you these things. People, these people have to
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:42.920]  go to this stuff and see it for themselves. But we're going to get into, as I said, we're
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:48.520]  going to get into the history of this bin Laden figure of the next couple of segments. And
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:56.560]  then in the third hour, we've got Aaron Dykes. So let's go back to up until 2001, the sort
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:01.840]  of, you know, the real death of bin Laden, which occurred according to everyone who
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:10.600]  is in the know in 2001 shortly after 9-11. Depending on the specific case that you choose
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:17.960]  to look at, bin Laden was either being actively assisted and protected or willfully ignored
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:25.040]  and allowed to operate by our governments and intelligence agencies. In the early 90s,
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:34.560]  he led what became al-Qaeda to Bosnia shortly after the outbreak of the conflict there to
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:42.280]  fight against the Bosnian Serbs who subsequently became the target of U.S. NATO airstrikes.
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:50.040]  But during that conflict, the Pentagon smuggled vast amounts of arms to Bosnian Muslims led
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:56.080]  from afar by bin Laden, all the while knowing they were being led by bin Laden. And the
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:40:06.920]  arms were smuggled through Croatia, which was in flagrant violation, sorry, of U.N. arms
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:14.560]  embargoes at the time. They were working in tandem with, actually with Iran and his
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:21.200]  baller to deliver weapons to these Bosnian Muslims. They had the financial backing of
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:26.720]  Saudi Arabia as well. But the reason for all this was because Pentagon was indebted to these
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:35.680]  fighters stemming from Afghanistan and also stemming from the first Gulf War against Saddam
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:44.080]  Hussein. During the Bosnia conflict, they were even involved in airlifting hundreds
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:52.000]  of these fighters, these Islamist fighters, into Bosnia on a black C-130 Hercules aircraft.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:41:03.040]  I mean, you can search the headline, America used Islamists to arm Bosnian Muslims and
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:08.320]  you'll get a lot of articles that break this down. And, you know, this is one of the first
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:19.280]  examples of bin Laden being used as this Western asset. There's an excellent account
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:25.720]  actually written by a professor here in the U.K. called Richard J. Aldrich, who was a
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:31.280]  professor at Nottingham University where I studied. And he's written articles for The
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:36.400]  Guardian and I think he's now a professor at Warwick University. He's since moved. He's
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:43.240]  put lots of books out there, sort of delving into the, you know, behind the scenes intelligence
[01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:51.160]  of the Bosnian conflicts and what really went on there with Pentagon's involvement.
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:58.360]  And obviously they set up, following the end of the war, they set up terrorist training
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:03.680]  camps in Bosnia, these Muslims that have been funded. And eventually it was all blowback
[01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:11.360]  again and it came back onto the Pentagon and they became the ones that eventually we were
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:14.680]  basically in conflict with there.
[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:22.080]  So another classic example of the sort of using these groups and bin Laden as the pawns
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:27.160]  in the chess game for the Western intelligence services and, you know, when they're done
[01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:33.680]  with them, they simply discard them, they simply get rid of them or have to fight them.
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:41.160]  And you know, when they become useful again, they will shift them into a different territory
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:50.960]  as they did in when the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia occurred in 1999, where bin Laden's fighters
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:59.600]  were moved into Kosovo, which is in Serbia's southern provinces to aid the Kosovo Liberation
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:08.680]  Army, which was basically an Albanian terrorist faction. So again, another example, it was,
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:14.680]  you know, the U.S. and NATO and the Kosovo Liberation Army with Al Qaeda that were involved
[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:18.840]  in the terrorist acts that were triggering responses from the Serbian authorities that
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:23.000]  eventually led to the conflicts there.
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:29.880]  And you know, eventually before weeks, and this went on for years and weeks before 9-11,
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:37.860]  we were still helping, still using Al Qaeda there. They were, some fighters were airlifted
[01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:45.120]  out of Macedonia on U.S. planes, according to German intelligence sources, which means
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:52.000]  obviously that our intelligence was still, you know, aiding Al Qaeda fighters at that
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:59.480]  time weeks before 9-11. And then, of course, there was a similar event which occurred following
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:08.400]  the invasion of Afghanistan in November 2001, where hundreds of fighters, hundreds of Taliban
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:16.600]  and Al Qaeda fighters were flown out of Afghanistan into Pakistan on Pakistani cargo planes,
[01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:21.000]  which couldn't have possibly happened without the Pentagon's knowledge because they'd secured
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.800]  the region at that time.
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:31.600]  But sort of going back to the mid-90s, another place where bin Laden popped up, this mythical
[01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:43.800]  terror mastermind, was Libya in 1996, when it was revealed that by French intelligence
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:50.680]  that there was a plot to assassinate Gaddafi, which obviously has ramifications for what's
[01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:59.320]  going on in Libya now, as it was revealed by French intelligence that Western intelligence
[01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:08.760]  services had wired $200,000 to a cell controlled by bin Laden, which moved into Libya to initiate
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:18.560]  a grenade attack on Gaddafi. And after the plot failed, I think the Libyans released
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:25.400]  footage of the attack on TV claiming it was a Western attack. And this was then verified
[01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:34.880]  by sources in that worked in MI5 here and French intelligence. And the Libyans issued
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:41.040]  an arrest warrant for bin Laden, which was an interpol arrest warrant, which was the
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:50.440]  first actual arrest warrant for him. But it was actively blocked by MI6, who were obviously
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:46:00.520]  wary of their own ties to the plot to assassinate Gaddafi being exposed. And this has all been
[01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:08.480]  revealed in mainstream media sources. And terrorists from that cell in Libya went on
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:14.320]  to, they were the same terrorists who went on to conduct the bombings on the embassies
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:24.400]  in Africa in the late 90s. So again, it's an example of bin Laden and al Qaeda being
[01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:37.480]  groomed, funded, trained, used, aided, moved around like pawns in a chess game. And so
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:42.960]  we arrive at the situation now where, you know, we've got bin Laden as the ultimate
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:51.200]  buggy man in this this crazy false raid. And it all stems back to this. And we can go we
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:55.920]  can give a few more examples as well of it and being an intelligence asset, we can point
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:04.240]  to the time he was in Sudan. And around the same time as the Libya plot in the mid 90s,
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:10.520]  it was known that he was in Sudan. The government there contacted the CIA and offered to have
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:17.160]  him arrested. Obviously, it was the Clinton administration at this time. And they offered
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:22.920]  to have him arrested and shipped off to Saudi Arabia, where he could be held in custody and
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:29.200]  then extracted from there by the Americans, should they wish to do so. But the Clinton
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:36.840]  administration turned it down, turned the offer down from the Sudanese government. Because
[01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:44.240]  they said they didn't have enough of a case to indict bin Laden, which is on its face
[01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:51.800]  ridiculous because at the time he was publicly known as, you know, the greatest financier
[01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:57.760]  of terrorist projects around the world, obviously, behind the scenes. There's more going on
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:04.360]  to them. But publicly, that's what he was known as. But still, the Clinton administration
[01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:13.880]  didn't have a case, it claimed. So that was the first opportunity they had to capture
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:21.520]  him and extract him and deal with him back then, all those years before 9-11. And the
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:26.680]  Saudis refused to cooperate with it anyway, obviously, because of their own intelligence
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:35.600]  ties to him as well. So, I mean, the fallout of all that was bin Laden was expelled from
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:43.240]  Sudan and he went to Afghanistan, where we know he went on to conduct all the other plots
[01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:51.420]  he did. He took a, he chartered a flight from Afghanistan in 1996 with 150 followers, including
[01:48:51.420 --> 01:48:57.600]  some of his family, to Afghanistan. And on the way, the plane actually stopped and refueled
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:05.760]  in Qatar, the Gulf state of Qatar, which is also an ally, a friendly nation to Washington.
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:12.200]  So, I mean, the authorities there would have known, would have contacted the Americans.
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:18.600]  But still, he was allowed to proceed after that stop in Qatar. And there were also, you
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:27.360]  know, other opportunities for Clinton to capture and bring to justice bin Laden. In 2000, the
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:36.600]  Taliban offered to hand bin Laden over to a Gulf state through unofficial channels, contacted
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:42.800]  the Clinton administration or offered to do this. But the provisor was it was through
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:53.040]  unofficial channels, sent out at the time, the senior counterterrorism advisor, Richard
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:58.560]  Clark, who has since gone on to reveal, you know, a lot of interesting facts about what
[01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:09.640]  went on at that time. They sent Richard Clark to the United Arab Emirates, which is, which
[01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:18.080]  was the Gulf state involved in supposedly taking bin Laden from the Taliban, who later,
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:23.560]  you know, the United Arab Emirates later denied that there was any kind of plot to offer bin
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:29.200]  Laden over. And it was basically revealed that because the White House had gone through
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:35.400]  official channels and not unofficial channels to do all this, as had been demanded, that
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:43.120]  the opportunity fell through again. So, you know, you can search for details of all these
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:49.240]  opportunities of seas bin Laden. I think it was the Sunday Times that broke this a number
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:53.120]  of years ago, and the articles are still out there. So all this information is still out
[01:50:53.120 --> 01:51:01.600]  there. After we come back from the break, we're going to look at opportunities post 9 11.
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:06.240]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage
[01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:10.440]  vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds
[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:14.280]  could become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have all performed even
[01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:18.440]  gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:23.000]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid

[01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:31.320]  We continue to be told that we're going to be attacked any second. We're under more
[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:38.920]  danger now than we were before. As the TSA continues to fry travelers in the airports
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:46.400]  and stick their hands down your trousers, we're discussing the psychological resurrection
[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:52.000]  of Osama bin Laden on the Alex Jones show. I'm Steve Watson. Alex is away for a couple
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:57.560]  of days. Like I said before, we've got Aaron Dykes coming up in the third hour, so stay
[01:54:57.560 --> 01:55:04.840]  around for that. Before, we were discussing chances to grab bin Laden that were overlooked
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:19.520]  or ignored purposefully previous to 9-11. After 9-11, and as Sibyl Edmonds, the FBI translator
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:28.360]  has famously testified, bin Laden was working with the CIA right up until 9-11 and beyond
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:40.080]  9-11, really, because we had reports of bin Laden being visited by CIA officials in July
[01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:49.160]  2001 in a hospital in Dubai, an American hospital where he was being treated for kidney disease
[01:55:49.160 --> 01:56:01.040]  and the CIA agents visited there and later bragged about this. Obviously, he was reported
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:05.600]  to have serious kidney disease, and that is a factor in the reason why many people believe
[01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:12.480]  this current raid hoax to be just that hoax, because he's been dead for a long time, because
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:18.520]  there's no way he could have been hiding out on a kidney dialysis machine, plotting
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:25.560]  the greatest, the biggest terrorist plot in the history of America, in the history of
[01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:31.240]  the world. I mean, it's relatively common knowledge as well that the bin Laden family
[01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:41.240]  was allowed to be flown out of the U.S. following the attacks. If you've seen Michael Morse
[01:56:41.240 --> 01:56:45.640]  film, it's even in there, he goes into it. So that's relatively common knowledge, but
[01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:52.640]  what's not common knowledge about that is the fact that the FBI knowingly allowed one
[01:56:52.640 --> 01:57:01.040]  of those flights to be chartered by bin Laden himself. This is something we revealed in
[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:10.040]  2007, 2008, when judicial watch, the sort of watchdog, the government watchdog, obtained
[01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:19.480]  documents through the Freedom of Information Act, which outlined the fact that the FBI
[01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:27.920]  knew that one of the flights that the bin Laden family, which is a vast, extensive family,
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:35.120]  Saudi millionaires were flown out of the U.S. after 9-11, they knew that one of the flights
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:42.120]  was chartered by bin Laden himself, which is incredible given that he was, you must remember
[01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:48.200]  that in the early, in the first early days after 9-11, you know, it was only the media
[01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:57.080]  that was speculating that bin Laden was the big mastermind behind the operation. So at
[01:57:57.080 --> 01:58:06.200]  that time, it wasn't official, but the FBI still knew that he was the biggest terrorist
[01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:13.080]  in the world and they'd allowed him to charter a flight with his own family out of the U.S.
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:18.000]  So we'll get into more about this after the break, and then we've got Aaron Dykes coming
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:46.000]  up. So stay tuned, this is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:56.160]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important
[01:58:56.160 --> 01:59:01.440]  day in America in more than 50 years. He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:05.240]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of
[01:59:05.240 --> 01:59:09.080]  your health and your own family. Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over
[01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:13.640]  the years. The crazy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse
[01:59:13.640 --> 01:59:18.400]  of GM, Pannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:23.400]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently, he created a video which
[01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:27.600]  you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet,
[01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:31.760]  and it's a real eye-opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this
[01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:35.960]  free video online today. He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you
[01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:42.200]  can take to protect yourself. You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's

[02:00:12.200 --> 02:00:29.920]  So this is the Alex Jones show. I'm Steve Watson. Alex is away on business. We're passing
[02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:36.360]  the bat on as it were today between hosts to try and keep the show crisp for you. We've
[02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:44.080]  got Aaron Dykes coming up now. So I was talking about the fact that bin Laden had been allowed
[02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:50.960]  to charter a flight himself knowingly by the FBI after 9-11 out of the US, which to many
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:57.600]  people is just unbelievable, but the documents are there. The FBI actually redacted bin
[02:00:57.600 --> 02:01:07.120]  Laden's name from the documents, took his name out and cover up the fact that it was bin Laden.
[02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:11.120]  You can search for this. You'll find articles on this, plenty of articles, one written by
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:16.320]  myself where I point to mainstream sources in the documents themselves released by Judy.
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:22.320]  It'll watch. Of course, after this, there was never a formal indictment of bin Laden
[02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:28.960]  for 9-11 by the FBI because they said from their own mouths, there was simply not enough
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:35.920]  evidence to go on that he was involved in the plot right up until his supposed death.
[02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:43.840]  He's never been indicted for that. Today we learned that the civil court case is being
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:49.200]  dropped in New York against bin Laden because he's now being put out to pasture. He's now
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:02:00.000]  dead officially. We had other documents such as the W199I document which the Bush administration
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:07.880]  basically ordered the FBI to back off investigating the bin Laden family prior to 9-11. It just
[02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:12.800]  goes on and on and on. The bottom line is this whole we've got him thing now is completely
[02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:22.040]  asinine and it requires a worldview that is just completely beyond belief naive and also
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:30.240]  requires a dangerously unquestioning, unswerving attitude towards our own governments and their
[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:35.760]  secret services which have been engaged in illegal activity all over the globe for as
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:41.440]  long as we can remember. Let's bring Aaron up here to see what he thinks about this.
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:47.440]  Aaron are you there? I am here Steve. It's good to be on with you. You know you go ahead
[02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:52.640]  please. So I was just going to ask you what information you've got coming up in the next
[02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:57.560]  hour. You know I really want to get into the whole case of how the Obama administration
[02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:03.320]  is trying to control reality. We've got all these conflicting stories and I think it's
[02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:08.480]  really the first time we've seen the president playing with the Info War but the fact is
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:13.640]  reality is reality and they can't control a lemon story any better than anyone else
[02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:19.840]  can. Nothing has ever added up about this 9-11 case and I guess bin Laden's death is
[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:26.920]  primarily a fairy tale ending to a classic fairy tale. Yeah and it's this whole sort
[02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:32.480]  of cognitive dissonance thing because you know by now people know that a lot of these
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:37.200]  facts that we've continually been bringing up for the last 10 years they by now they
[02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:41.360]  know that they're true a lot of people so they're holding in their heads at the same
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:48.040]  time to conflicting ideas and they're choosing not to you know they're choosing not to recognise
[02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:53.320]  it because you know it's easier for them you know but at the same time they've seen the
[02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:58.520]  endless wars the build up of the domestic police state and everything that our governments
[02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:04.120]  have lied to us about but yet there's still this group of people that are just blindly
[02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:10.280]  accepting the illusion this this fable that's being put out there. I mean where do you see
[02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:17.200]  this heading after you know Obama's big grandstand today? Well he's of course trying to get political
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:23.040]  points I've seen some of the footage as I'm sure others have of him at ground zero but
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:28.200]  mainly we know that they plan to continue this war on terror. There's the Libya front
[02:04:28.200 --> 02:04:33.560]  where Al Qaeda is now an ally and that really conflicts with the really old out of date
[02:04:33.560 --> 02:04:38.120]  bin Laden story and I think they're looking to rebrand that so they can rewrite the narrative
[02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:44.400]  kind of new rules but I'll get more on that on the other side. Yep good job I'm Steve
[02:04:44.400 --> 02:05:01.880]  Watson cheers for having me and over to Aaron now.

[02:06:01.360 --> 02:06:05.520]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:10.240]  with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire function
[02:06:10.240 --> 02:06:14.080]  of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[02:06:14.080 --> 02:06:19.520]  anywhere in or on the body. My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver
[02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:24.240]  Lungs Generator. Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and

[02:06:54.760 --> 02:07:02.160]  questions you may have. That's www.silverlungs.com. This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you
[02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:07.160]  should consider buying a solar power generator. Number 1, new climate legislation could easily
[02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:11.880]  double or triple your electric bill. Number 2, our new energies are wants to control how
[02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:16.560]  much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control
[02:07:16.560 --> 02:07:22.240]  of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number 3, in some areas of the
[02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:27.300]  country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only
[02:07:27.300 --> 02:07:32.280]  compounding the problem. Number 4, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.280 --> 02:07:36.560]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number 5,
[02:07:36.560 --> 02:07:41.000]  a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks,
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:44.600]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of
[02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:51.680]  my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:23.360]  Okay, we are back on the Alex Jones show. Alex is out for the day. I'm Aaron Dykes.
[02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:30.000]  You've heard Steve and Paul Joseph Watson and just our incredible guest, Pachesnik,
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:34.720]  you know, willing to speak out even more than he has before. And of course, Dr. Paul Craig
[02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:41.440]  Roberts. Of course, we've got to go more into the Bin Laden death hoax, which really,
[02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:49.720]  of course, has to do with Obama's sagging poll numbers, practically a defeated presidency.
[02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:54.320]  And of course, they're spending it for political points. Of course, he's down at ground zero
[02:08:54.320 --> 02:09:01.600]  trying to give closure to the whole 9-11 myth. But the way I see it, it's really a milestone
[02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:07.680]  in the Info War, even if they win short term, even though their story is falling apart.
[02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:11.720]  They've got conflicting reports. They can't even agree on what was going on in this Bin
[02:09:11.720 --> 02:09:17.480]  Laden bunker. And we'll get more into that in just a second. But just to point out the
[02:09:17.480 --> 02:09:23.000]  obvious, why couldn't they show a photo not only of Bin Laden and his death when he's
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:27.280]  gruesome, but why couldn't they show a still from these cameras that were in during the
[02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:34.120]  raid showing him in his last moments alive, etc. But I really question whether Obama is
[02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:40.440]  at that Nixonian point where he's taken his enemies personally, sees his critics in the
[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:45.960]  world as enemies, and is really trying to score points with them. He seemed very bitter
[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:51.760]  in having to release his birth certificate, a basic proof of his eligibility. Now he seems
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:56.880]  very bitter at the idea of having to release Bin Laden photos saying that no one's going
[02:09:56.880 --> 02:10:03.600]  to believe it anyway. And we really heard from Secretary Clinton a few months ago really
[02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:09.640]  identifying that this is an info war, and that in fact the government, the State Department,
[02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:15.560]  the Obama administration, the Bush administration for that matter are losing that info war.
[02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:21.560]  Everything about the 9-11 lie has been picked apart for nearly a decade now, of course.
[02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:26.800]  It's never made sense. And I guess it just adds up that a fairy tale would have a fairy
[02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:34.840]  tale conclusion with a mythological death of Bin Laden, no photos, no evidence, DNA supposedly
[02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:40.440]  matched before there's time to conduct a proper test, buried at sea.
[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:46.800]  Do we have the clip of Hillary Clinton? Yeah, let's pull that up and get it ready. It's
[02:10:46.800 --> 02:10:53.440]  really an info war where we're winning. The supposed conspiracy theorists have pointed
[02:10:53.440 --> 02:10:58.520]  out inconsistencies, brought up facts when they're available. You know, sure there's
[02:10:58.520 --> 02:11:02.760]  people trying to figure out what may have happened, but generally we're picking apart
[02:11:02.760 --> 02:11:11.800]  this terrible, unstable, impossible official story, and it just doesn't add up. And here
[02:11:11.800 --> 02:11:16.960]  we have it's an admitted info war. We know disinformation and spend is put out by the
[02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:20.080]  government. Let's cue that Hillary Clinton clip.
[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:26.160]  We are engaged in an information war. You know, during the Cold War we did a great job
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:30.600]  in getting America's message out. After the Berlin Wall fell we said, okay, fine, enough
[02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:35.760]  of that. You know, we've done it, we're done. And unfortunately we are paying a big price
[02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:43.800]  for it. And our private media cannot fill that gap. In fact, our private media, particularly
[02:11:43.800 --> 02:11:50.080]  cultural programming, often works at counter purposes to what we truly are as Americans
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:55.080]  and what our values are. I remember having an Afghan general tell me that the only thing
[02:11:55.080 --> 02:11:59.640]  he thought about Americans is that all the men wrestled in the women.
[02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:06.120]  So you see, you know, opening up roles for state controlled media, state planted propaganda.
[02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:12.400]  We know what Cass Sunstein has written. They want to have plants to, to rebut, supposed
[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:18.040]  conspiracy theorists to counter information they don't think is politically expedient
[02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:24.080]  or that doesn't help prop up their regime and really would amounts to a pile of lies.
[02:12:24.080 --> 02:12:29.040]  I bring this up even though it's a few months old because it really is an info war. And
[02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:34.480]  I think we're seeing the moment where Obama is taking a personal part in that info war,
[02:12:34.480 --> 02:12:39.640]  which we're winning. I'm leading up to an Alex Jones clip. You would have seen it on infowars.com
[02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:45.960]  and prisonplanned.com. Alex Jones mega rant unleashed winning. You don't dictate reality.
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:52.320]  I'm the king of reality, not conspiracy. That's not Alex on an ego trip. As you, you know,
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:56.880]  he says you in the clip. I mean, he uses the first person in the clip because he's engaged
[02:12:56.880 --> 02:13:01.040]  with this British host in these collars as we're going to hear in a minute, but he's
[02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:07.880]  really talking about the people who've tried to uncover the truth on 9 11 and so many other
[02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:13.360]  topics that we're winning. And they can't dictate a false reality. They can't even hold
[02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:18.480]  up a false story about bin Laden's death. It's completely falling apart at the seams.
[02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:25.320]  We have very likely evidence of senators being deliberately fed disinformation. Senator Scott
[02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:33.960]  Brown, Senator Saxby Chambliss and other senators admit they were conned by a totally fake bin
[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:40.320]  Laden photo, which they in turn used to declare that, yes, in fact, he's dead. Don't question
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:46.760]  this. And they were in fact conned. We don't know exactly deliberately, but I think it's
[02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:52.000]  highly likely they were deliberately steered to believing that in fact bin Laden was dead
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:59.440]  based on false photographic evidence. And we know that many family members headline 9 11
[02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:05.200]  family invited to presidential ground zero snubs Obama demands to see the photo. We
[02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:11.600]  have Canadian members of the NDP demanding to see photos saying they have doubts that
[02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:16.960]  the US even has these photos. And why not? When there's no evidence, there's every reason
[02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:23.160]  to doubt what's going on and demand more information. So we're going to get more into how the administration
[02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:29.600]  is trying to build this this kingdom of lies with this fairy tale ending to the 9 11 myth so they
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:35.440]  can rebrand Al Qaeda for a new era of the war on terror, which they say could be another 100 year
[02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:43.840]  war, you know, like 700 years ago in Europe. But let's go to the Alex Jones clip. Just told you
[02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:48.640]  and we're all lucky, secretly hanging out the Pentagon, confirmed admitted. Come on, pull the
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:53.480]  trigger, pull the trigger. Elizabeth, thank you for that. Great. I have you on. Let's take another
[02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:59.800]  leg as Elizabeth. Let's take another call from Daniel, who's near what for Daniel? Hello. Good
[02:14:59.800 --> 02:15:03.520]  evening. So what would you like to say? Hi, good evening. I just wanted to cover a few points.
[02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:09.360]  I mean, I've obviously been listening for the last last hour or so. And I strongly disagree with
[02:15:09.360 --> 02:15:14.720]  quite a few of the things you said now. I mean, just just that I've said or Alex has said Alex
[02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:25.160]  said, I mean, what you've said, and neither here nor there. So I mean, Alex really is how can you
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:30.880]  possibly say that any of this mission to do with killing Osama bin Laden was set up in any way. Now,
[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:35.680]  I mean, you take the situation. I mean, you're laughing already. I mean, for example, I mean,
[02:15:35.680 --> 02:15:38.880]  take with the last guy that was on just said, I completely agree with him. Everything you ever
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:43.600]  say, and everyone that is like you, that is a conspiracy theorist, and I do categorize you in
[02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:49.840]  conspiracy theorists who relish the word, you don't have any intellectual acumen, any gravitas,
[02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:56.720]  you just have a label so you can your mind can decide snobberishly to say that I don't have
[02:15:56.720 --> 02:16:00.960]  documentation. Come on, fella. Let's let me stop right there. Let me stop right there. What was
[02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:07.600]  the point you're saying? How can I say, did you not hear me? May 25th, 2010, Washington Post,
[02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:15.120]  the CIA admits that they created fake bin Laden videos. So a group that has created fake videos
[02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:19.920]  before you said yes. So the fact that you and your your friends have made a video and put on
[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:24.160]  YouTube, that makes it that makes it you're showing you're showing you the conspiracy theories.
[02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:32.000]  I just gave you the date and what to search Washington Post and you just and you just said
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:38.480]  it's going to be on YouTube. I just told you, buddy boy, my source is not YouTube. My source is what
[02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:45.600]  I just told you. And when I say Steve Pachennik was on or Hamid Ghoul was on, these are serious,
[02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:52.240]  well known, respected people today agreeing with me. Okay, let's let you go ahead. Listen,
[02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:59.120]  you can't handle the truth. You can't handle real intellect and red blood. All you've got is shooting
[02:16:59.120 --> 02:17:04.560]  your mouth off with that cliched term. I'm not the king of conspiracy. I'm the king of reality.
[02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:11.040]  Daniel, come back on that in 30 seconds. I told you, Washington Post, listen to me. I bet you
[02:17:11.040 --> 02:17:15.440]  don't believe, I bet you don't believe that Araldo Rivera with the Marines admits they were the
[02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:21.440]  opiates. Alex, let that let down response to that. In general society, there is a very small
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:26.320]  sector of people that would be classed. You're a minority. We're the majority. Listen to your
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:31.280]  mind control garbage. I would class you and then I would class you in an extremist group that
[02:17:31.280 --> 02:17:36.720]  would account for not knowing. I need to be dealt with. Listen to him. He don't believe the queen
[02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:43.680]  loves it. You are an extremist. You preach hate. I need to be shut down under the EU convention
[02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:49.600]  on spreading radical. Shut him up. Shut him up. I don't agree with him. He's giving me too many
[02:17:49.600 --> 02:17:55.760]  facts. It's scary. He's an extremist. He's a minority. Oh, I'm a minority. That's why my
[02:17:55.760 --> 02:18:02.160]  YouTube videos have millions of views of peace and 98% of people are voting that they like it.
[02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:07.760]  That's why I have millions of listeners. That's why I'm loved all over the world because I'm a
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:14.080]  dangerous minority. You listen to me. Ideas are bulletproof and you cannot stop us. Liberty is
[02:18:14.080 --> 02:18:21.440]  rising. The spirit of 1776 is indomitable and you are a mind controlled weasel who feel solace
[02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:27.600]  in joining the hive board of weakness information. You are not the intellectual. You are not the
[02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:35.520]  person to dictate to me what reality is. Do you understand me, boy? Do you understand me, boy?
[02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:42.800]  Come on, Alex. Let's make that clip out. It's a really incredible battle between Alex and just
[02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:49.840]  the ideologically dense listeners who refuse to embrace the facts, look at the reality factors
[02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:56.960]  like the fact that opium is more important than any supposed act of Osama bin Laden in the real
[02:18:56.960 --> 02:19:03.280]  war on terror, so-called, in Afghanistan, opium and oil and geopolitics. That's what's really at
[02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:09.920]  play. But more importantly, Alex makes the point that we are winning in reality because so much
[02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:17.360]  disinformation is put out by the system. These mindless drones can't even face reality. They
[02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:22.480]  they've tried to belittle Alex, consider him to be a minority. He's preaching hate speech. He's a
[02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:27.360]  conspiracy theorist. But really, Alex is always stuck by the facts. He's been vindicated over
[02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:32.800]  the decades and so has everyone else who's been fighting in this war. Just an incredible clip,
[02:19:32.800 --> 02:19:38.160]  but it just goes to show as this bin Laden hoax is totally falling apart, we'll get into more of
[02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:42.800]  those details on the way back all about how they changed the story of what even happened during
[02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:48.720]  this supposed bin Laden raid, all part of the 9-11 fairy tale. We'll be back, infowars.com, on the
[02:19:48.720 --> 02:19:58.720]  other side of this.

[02:22:02.080 --> 02:22:07.200]  earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing
[02:22:07.200 --> 02:22:11.920]  compared to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the United
[02:22:11.920 --> 02:22:17.120]  States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless, all caused by the devalued
[02:22:17.120 --> 02:22:21.120]  U.S. dollar, while the mainstream media continues to ignore inflation. Our friends,

[02:24:25.600 --> 02:24:33.360]  We are back. That is news. We are winning the resistance. We're winning the infowar. You just
[02:24:33.360 --> 02:24:40.800]  heard Alex on Talksport in the UK brushing aside the silly arguments from the host and from these
[02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:47.120]  callers completely out of the real reality paradigm. We don't know everything that's going on, but we
[02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:52.640]  are trying to follow the facts and break apart these lies. Meanwhile, we have an Obama administration
[02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:58.400]  who's admittedly been given a difficult task because he's expected to continue all the lies and
[02:24:58.400 --> 02:25:05.520]  propaganda that were built up in the post-911 era by the Bush administration. We know the whole
[02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:11.520]  thing is one big lie from saying they could never foresee the attacks coming despite the fact that
[02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:18.320]  there were military drills with bin Laden's face and the Twin Towers on the cover despite the fact
[02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:25.760]  that they had intelligence reports, the presidential PDB 51 briefing declaring that bin Laden was
[02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:31.440]  determined to attack despite that we saw Condoleezza Rice and Bush saying they never could have even
[02:25:31.440 --> 02:25:38.560]  imagined that something would happen akin to 9-11. It's all a lie, but at the same time we have
[02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:45.920]  Obama with floundering ratings really trying to entrench himself against a public that he
[02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:52.240]  surely sees as an enemy much in a Nixon, Richard Nixon kind of way where he's just surrounded by
[02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:59.760]  enemies of one kind or another, people challenging him to produce documents. This is a man who said
[02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:06.320]  he's part of the most transparent administration of all time. He's anything but he's continued
[02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:14.320]  Guantanamo Bay, he's continued harsh interrogations, obviously continued the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
[02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:21.280]  while expending into Libya and really it's hit a juncture where the Al Qaeda myth has to be rebranded,
[02:26:21.280 --> 02:26:27.040]  there has to be a new set of rules for this war on terror and I think the point came where they
[02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:32.960]  had to put bin Laden to bed sooner or later and it was a politically expedient time to hopefully
[02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:39.120]  bolster Obama's ratings. We did see a jump but it's already been going back down that is the
[02:26:39.120 --> 02:26:45.040]  approval for Obama and he's really in this position where they've claimed a certain story
[02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:51.920]  without providing any evidence, that is a known logical fallacy more or less referred to as
[02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:57.200]  appeal to authority. He expects us to take everything on faith because they are the supposed
[02:26:57.200 --> 02:27:01.920]  authorities in government, they will dictate reality, that's everything Alex is speaking
[02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:07.760]  against in the rant we heard in the previous segment and it just goes to show that here's the
[02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:13.520]  Atlantic Monthly, the slippery story of bin Laden killed, the early narrative of the assault on
[02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:19.120]  Osama bin Laden and I'm using his wife as a human shield and firing from behind her.
[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:24.800]  Now we learn he wasn't even armed, they've got a photo here of kind of a revised script
[02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:30.480]  that the White House said Tuesday they blamed the fog of war for conflicting statements
[02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:37.120]  and recounting of the events of the Abadabad raid that in fact he was never even armed
[02:27:37.120 --> 02:27:43.440]  and that's if you even believe Osama bin Laden was even still living, there were reports certainly
[02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:50.240]  of his death as early as December 2001, even if he wasn't dead he was a very sick man.
[02:27:50.240 --> 02:27:56.400]  Here's an article in from Washington blog, it's on infowars.com why didn't we capture the terrorist
[02:27:56.400 --> 02:28:02.000]  kingpin and interrogate him but we'll get into that point in just a minute but it brings up how
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:08.240]  he not only had the kidney dialysis problem, he very clearly had diabetes, he could barely move
[02:28:08.240 --> 02:28:14.720]  the left side of his body, bin Laden had low blood pressure, he had a wound in his foot,
[02:28:15.520 --> 02:28:21.920]  he was flown to Dubai in an American hospital for treatment for 10 days for his kidney dialysis
[02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:32.160]  issues back in 2001-2002, he's suffering from hepatitis C, he may have even had Marfan syndrome,
[02:28:32.160 --> 02:28:36.640]  a disorder of the connective tissue that would have given him back problems, heart conditions,
[02:28:36.640 --> 02:28:42.640]  the possibility for sudden death, he may have been an ideological enemy but this was not a person
[02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:49.680]  in any position to fire a weapon or quote unquote resist, they put forward the idea that they only
[02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:55.520]  killed bin Laden if indeed he was even in this compound because of supposedly resisting, then
[02:28:55.520 --> 02:29:00.640]  we see that story completely fall apart as a hoax, he wasn't armed and he would have been a sickly
[02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:06.480]  old man if he was even in this compound very unlikely that he would have been able to even wield
[02:29:06.480 --> 02:29:13.920]  a weapon but moreover we have this whole false debate that Obama White House couldn't produce
[02:29:13.920 --> 02:29:20.080]  evidence, there's a complete opposite of a trail of evidence because the photos would be upsetting
[02:29:20.080 --> 02:29:25.520]  because they had to bury him at sea according to Muslim cultural norms which wasn't even true,
[02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:32.000]  why would they care about upsetting photos when they released Abu Ghraib, American soldiers have
[02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:38.240]  desecrated the Quran and they completely disrespected the 9-11 families, wouldn't even dig up all the
[02:29:38.240 --> 02:29:44.320]  remains and properly bury them instead sent them to a trashy, it's complete hypocrisy, we'll get

[02:33:38.400 --> 02:33:43.520]  on the line and we've just been going through what a hoax this is how it's falling apart
[02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:49.440]  how obama really is going to have egg on his face uh just a few minutes because this story
[02:33:49.440 --> 02:33:54.080]  doesn't add up they're completely conflicting uh but let's go to alex and see what he has to say
[02:33:54.080 --> 02:34:00.640]  alex are you there yes sir and it's great to be here uh with you uh i apologize to listeners
[02:34:00.640 --> 02:34:06.320]  that i'm not going to be in today or tomorrow but we've all choked about the murphy's law over
[02:34:06.320 --> 02:34:10.960]  the years the office that a few times a year i take off two or three days take my children
[02:34:10.960 --> 02:34:18.160]  gambling or fishing that there's always a big giant world event uh but uh i just want to say
[02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:23.840]  i'm proud i am of the fact that i've got such a wonderful team in erin dyke's and paul watson and
[02:34:23.840 --> 02:34:32.720]  t watson and the curtain memo and the chair and and marley and uh mad and uh all the other great
[02:34:32.720 --> 02:34:37.440]  folks in the office all the rest of the team and just the amazing research and how on target you
[02:34:37.440 --> 02:34:41.920]  guys have been i am meant to be where i was going by the time i was supposed to call but i got out
[02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:48.480]  of the house early uh this morning going out to this uh cabin to do some fishing and so i'm
[02:34:48.480 --> 02:34:53.360]  doing this here from the side of the road at a rest stop but i'll join folks for most of the
[02:34:53.360 --> 02:34:59.600]  last hour tomorrow from a landline because obviously uh there's no rest for those of us
[02:34:59.600 --> 02:35:04.000]  live in reality that live in the real world countering those that are tipping the force
[02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:09.840]  the false reality on us to break our will and train us just to accept surreal levels of government
[02:35:09.840 --> 02:35:18.480]  intrusion and the propaganda and disinformation designed to be uh ridiculous because once people
[02:35:18.480 --> 02:35:27.600]  buy into a ridiculous lie now their threshold is higher and higher for what could ever wake them up
[02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:33.600]  and this is a serious psychological warfare tactic that they're engaging in dr bubster
[02:35:33.600 --> 02:35:39.040]  tarpley agreed with me yesterday that this is uh they're they're putting out all these little pieces
[02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:44.160]  of okay uh we didn't kill it there and he had to shoot at us so he didn't put his wife in front
[02:35:44.160 --> 02:35:48.560]  of us and you know they've got that tinker toy stale helicopter we were sitting around the
[02:35:48.560 --> 02:35:53.680]  office saying what does this look like yesterday i said it's clearly a stale helicopter probably a
[02:35:53.680 --> 02:35:59.520]  remote control they flew in there with the incendiaries in it to explode it uh to then again add
[02:35:59.520 --> 02:36:04.960]  to the whole oh look it's there but the telltale signs that they come out of stale helicopter
[02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:10.480]  drone obviously uh we know they've had those i mean the they had the b2 bomber for 25 years
[02:36:10.480 --> 02:36:15.840]  but he even told us about it uh that itself is just an excellent tinker toy for the real things
[02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:21.840]  they've got in the late 1970s under Bob Bowman has confirmed this only because it leaked once
[02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:27.200]  it was a highly classified he'd be able to talk about it there he is over uh when he was uh
[02:36:27.200 --> 02:36:35.120]  had a star wars all eight seventies and it was still a secret program there is over over 100 and
[02:36:35.120 --> 02:36:46.960]  this was again in 1979 um stealth robotic space drones with sabo du meteor gun weapons and basically
[02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:53.440]  just takes the meteor system uh and and a similar to a meteor coming in at 30 000 miles an hour about
[02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:59.760]  how it accelerates over accelerates it with boosters over 40 000 miles an hour and is a
[02:36:59.760 --> 02:37:03.920]  decapitation weapon it doesn't have a nuclear explosion but the kinetic energy is similar
[02:37:03.920 --> 02:37:09.040]  to a low yield and has a critical penetration power and can destroy cases one mile under
[02:37:09.040 --> 02:37:14.640]  a large amount so let's understand folks uh there's an entire secret military an entire secret
[02:37:14.640 --> 02:37:19.760]  giant system and as i called it before anybody else to just understand the enemy the globalist
[02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:24.640]  scientific dictatorship the folks keep trailing us every day giant secret program now varsity
[02:37:24.640 --> 02:37:31.200]  classified uh the very same system uh that is putting fluoride in our water for 60 years
[02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:36.080]  now admittedly the brain damage is reduced fertility the same system the GMOs the crops
[02:37:36.080 --> 02:37:41.360]  in every case it has the close side effect the reducing fertility there's a giant scientific
[02:37:41.360 --> 02:37:48.880]  dictatorship overlaid via the national security state with a global standardization
[02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:54.640]  that is taking place now uh continuing getting into the bin Laden information ladies and gentlemen
[02:37:54.640 --> 02:37:59.760]  when i came out on sunday night and said it was a sky office because i knew bin Laden had died
[02:37:59.760 --> 02:38:03.840]  at least nine years before it was because i've known from top sources they were going to roll
[02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:09.680]  him out of the politically expedient time we were on record before it was the way he came out the
[02:38:09.680 --> 02:38:15.520]  way he delivered it the way that they were already trying to menace Pakistan hundreds of other points
[02:38:15.520 --> 02:38:20.000]  and then on monday we came out it's not that we're just saying everything's a conspiracy
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:24.880]  on that national media tv you never asked me well alex i mean you're not always a conspiracy
[02:38:24.880 --> 02:38:29.680]  this is a conspiracy well this is part of the night 11 line this is part of the class of
[02:38:29.680 --> 02:38:36.880]  civilizations uh this is part of this entire system that's meant to overthrow our classic
[02:38:36.880 --> 02:38:44.000]  and basic cannons of a free society in the name of them protecting us to think about their hopes
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:49.520]  even if you believe the terror is real you got a better chance of dying in a skateboarding accident
[02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:54.400]  there's hundreds of those a year you've got a better chance of dying in sports accidents uh there
[02:38:54.400 --> 02:39:00.240]  are more than 50 deaths a year in football uh at all levels of public school college and then and
[02:39:00.240 --> 02:39:05.920]  ended up to nfl i mean we have checkpoints for that i had noticed right after it happened they
[02:39:05.920 --> 02:39:10.160]  said see we're going to take more of your rights now you've got to have locally trained people
[02:39:10.160 --> 02:39:15.520]  in all your malls we already have the tsa psas put out three months ago two local police that
[02:39:15.520 --> 02:39:20.960]  they're now going to train police and have a tsa manager in the mall we have the video of the tsa
[02:39:20.960 --> 02:39:26.720]  already in the malls they're getting us ready for the total takeover of society and so we know it's
[02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:33.600]  all part of the larger continuity but remember we came out sunday and then on monday and said
[02:39:33.600 --> 02:39:38.960]  that's obviously a stage for illy illery putting her hand over about she's had to respond now saying
[02:39:38.960 --> 02:39:43.360]  she just you know had allergies or whatever or coughing but it's but she's obviously it's all
[02:39:43.360 --> 02:39:49.360]  scripted they all got up to look a certain way and uh that's not how those situation rooms work
[02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:56.000]  and then dr patenek who worked in things like that area said it was fake on tuesday on wednesday
[02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:01.520]  now it comes out that it is completely fake they've had to admit that uh the entire thing
[02:40:01.520 --> 02:40:07.600]  is a lie dumping the body in the ocean why uh all of it why why why one of his daughters captured
[02:40:07.600 --> 02:40:11.840]  the compound he'll buy back is getting intelligence they can tell us making the malls was captured
[02:40:11.840 --> 02:40:18.480]  there the guy had scores of concubines at least with four or five wives the whole family is british
[02:40:18.480 --> 02:40:24.800]  basad and uh u.s intelligence on record triple agents biggest construction company in the middle
[02:40:24.800 --> 02:40:32.560]  east gets explosive contracts in major nations to build us bases of major partners of third biggest
[02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:37.600]  owners queen of england george bush senior and then the bin laden's at carlall group uh one in
[02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:43.520]  guardian september 12 they were meeting at his private carlall meeting in dc on september 11
[02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:51.200]  on and on and on and on and on it i mean folks why do you think it came out in major news the day
[02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:59.360]  after 9 11 that in an air force base in nebraska uh berkshire hathaway had oren buffett the day
[02:40:59.360 --> 02:41:04.640]  before had told everybody they had to be there in a hangar for a secret meeting and he got the
[02:41:04.640 --> 02:41:10.160]  fortune of 100 leaders there in a private meeting to lay down the law to him about what had just
[02:41:10.160 --> 02:41:16.160]  happened this is a strategic operation where they do something so criminal so obvious they want people
[02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:20.000]  that are awake to know it was an inside job that's where they blow the buildings up on purpose
[02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:24.880]  that's why larry solverstein tells you people go building seven so that those that are awake are
[02:41:24.880 --> 02:41:29.360]  horrified of these criminals it's into mafia intimidation they were the mafia will get you
[02:41:29.360 --> 02:41:34.800]  but the further conditioned those they know will buy uh into the live this is the key
[02:41:35.680 --> 02:41:44.080]  to the overall psychological warfare uh grid that that they are engaged in and that's what
[02:41:44.080 --> 02:41:49.600]  they're doing with this current event so it's to resuscitate obama this plunging it's the
[02:41:49.600 --> 02:41:59.120]  launch of new era of al-qaeda uh also uh a system so that they can prepare to hype up more fear
[02:41:59.840 --> 02:42:04.960]  introduce the four new leaders of al-qaeda three of which are all more in the u.s two of which
[02:42:04.960 --> 02:42:10.240]  on record completely work for u.s intelligence adam gadan and amour are all totally admitted
[02:42:10.240 --> 02:42:19.680]  uh make uh we we've forced all that and it is uh basically also of course i said to menace uh menace
[02:42:19.680 --> 02:42:27.120]  pakistan yeah alex we're hearing just a bit of phone noise uh but what doesn't the president know
[02:42:27.120 --> 02:42:33.360]  he's just a puppet for this fall system why do we see him so personally engaged in worrying about
[02:42:33.360 --> 02:42:39.040]  what conspiracy theorists will say claiming the photos fake uh we've seen the public push back
[02:42:39.040 --> 02:42:45.280]  against the tsa against the 9-11 fable people want evidence they want justified policy not these
[02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:51.040]  oppressive uh continuity of agenda why is the president taking this so personally uh and speaking
[02:42:51.040 --> 02:42:56.720]  out against people like you who've been uh breaking apart this fraud for so long well erin do i need
[02:42:56.720 --> 02:43:01.040]  to reconnect to you because i'm sorry i'm on the middle of nowhere uh i think it sounds a little
[02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:08.480]  better but we just heard a couple cuts cut ins and outs so i would go ahead okay uh i want everybody
[02:43:08.480 --> 02:43:15.200]  to be very very carefully this is a war over truth and a war over reality as hillary said an info
[02:43:15.200 --> 02:43:22.880]  war they are scripting it to where they say the sky's red you say it's blue you're an evil conspiracy
[02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:30.240]  theorist anti-american they this is about selling people to accept whatever bizarreness they push
[02:43:30.240 --> 02:43:35.440]  on us it's all about breaking our will that's tsa and the molestation is about that's what all the
[02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:40.720]  surveillance is about that's what trading kids is about their parents is about is about being over
[02:43:40.720 --> 02:43:46.240]  the top and what's happening is they've got a nine percent of real reading in congress the president
[02:43:46.240 --> 02:43:53.760]  has no credibility the system is in crisis and they are basically floundering because most of
[02:43:53.760 --> 02:43:58.960]  the calls i hear the top radio now uh have shifted to people really waking up and questioning
[02:43:58.960 --> 02:44:07.040]  and so they are trying to come out and ludicule listen erin how's the phone coming in now yeah
[02:44:07.040 --> 02:44:12.640]  you're fine it was just a couple things are here as you know we left work at nine o'clock last night
[02:44:12.640 --> 02:44:19.040]  and you and i and all the it guys went to have dinner when i got in the car at 10 30 at night
[02:44:19.680 --> 02:44:26.800]  i did what i always do i surf dallas austin houston san antonio wake up radio stations now this
[02:44:26.800 --> 02:44:35.520]  happened i hit the first button to a local station during a syndicated show of a guy i've never heard
[02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:40.880]  of last name doile uh when looked him up he's pretty big syndicated show like 150 stations he
[02:44:40.880 --> 02:44:45.600]  was saying i have attacked him that way people listening it's a shy off think i deserve to have
[02:44:45.600 --> 02:44:50.400]  what's said about me said nothing no the guy was still not hurting uh or maybe someone ran a
[02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:57.760]  sigh up on him maybe went on and talked about uh dangerous and despicable and evil i was uh
[02:44:57.760 --> 02:45:02.720]  and now we're nuts and now we you know we're putting out distractions from our real problem
[02:45:02.720 --> 02:45:06.960]  propellers are funny those guys have talked about the colors are years ago but now all the big
[02:45:06.960 --> 02:45:12.160]  main line conservatives do because we're always pushing the envelope towards reality as the
[02:45:12.160 --> 02:45:18.160]  establishment tried to track it in the lawland and it went on and on and i should be the talkers
[02:45:18.160 --> 02:45:22.320]  keynote version and he didn't know him he should boycott it good i don't care i don't even think
[02:45:22.320 --> 02:45:25.680]  because of that i hope you guys boycott it pick a big stink out of it i don't want to travel to
[02:45:25.680 --> 02:45:29.120]  new york i mean i'm happy they invited me and want me to be there but hey listen i don't
[02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:33.680]  you know they told us they're gatekeeping i wanted to shut somebody out shut somebody up
[02:45:33.680 --> 02:45:38.160]  with that guy that caller and they want to say you know you're spreading a need to be shut down
[02:45:38.160 --> 02:45:43.200]  but that's their response to us you saw the Pittsburgh is that saying shut up alex jones
[02:45:43.200 --> 02:45:48.960]  that was the headline conference there's a person shut up having went on alex jones is dangerous
[02:45:48.960 --> 02:45:55.440]  shut him up because they can't deal with it everything we talked about four or five days ago
[02:45:55.440 --> 02:46:01.120]  that sunday night has now come true been proven because we're following the globalist program
[02:46:01.120 --> 02:46:06.960]  we understand their programs now i hit the this is insane i listened for about five minutes of
[02:46:06.960 --> 02:46:10.480]  this rant going into break i think i'm not even gonna listen to it because i'm gonna be the end
[02:46:10.480 --> 02:46:15.040]  of hearing about people talk about me i'm all over tv radio other shows you guys know 90 percent
[02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:19.120]  of the time i don't even go look at it read it i didn't even read the whole rolling stone article
[02:46:19.120 --> 02:46:23.840]  i was in i didn't even read the entire new york magazine i only watched myself on the
[02:46:23.840 --> 02:46:29.840]  you know nightline once i'm not into it i'm into information but so i said i'm not gonna listen
[02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:33.360]  to any more of this i'm gonna get some information see what else is happening i wanted to know the
[02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:42.320]  feel i hit the button i go to a dallas radio station big show they're attacking on the same
[02:46:42.320 --> 02:46:48.480]  talking points erin then i turned in my 30 minute drive home through a couple more stations and heard
[02:46:48.480 --> 02:46:53.120]  them saying who are these crazy conspiracy theorists but don't buy it they're bad torture is good this
[02:46:53.120 --> 02:46:58.720]  proves torture is good you know basically the talking points and then i dialed and found another
[02:46:58.720 --> 02:47:05.520]  syndicated show attacking me it was insane so we have hit such a site guys with the truth the
[02:47:05.520 --> 02:47:09.680]  globalists are always thinking they can get away with more and more killing kennedy and broad daylight
[02:47:09.680 --> 02:47:16.080]  blowing up the towers for everybody in broad daylight getting away with it that they've overreached
[02:47:16.080 --> 02:47:20.080]  and this thing is a chain reaction and they can't kill me because that'll just give us more
[02:47:20.080 --> 02:47:26.160]  credibility if they set us up nobody believes them anymore it makes us a martyr they are losing and
[02:47:26.160 --> 02:47:32.160]  they've got older minions and attack dogs coming after info wars dot com and prison planet this is
[02:47:32.160 --> 02:47:37.040]  so big i'm probably sure of me but left town that you guys are doing doing just a fabulous job but
[02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:41.200]  i mean i can't believe i'm in the middle of history like this and all my listeners are that we
[02:47:41.200 --> 02:47:48.000]  literally are carrying the banner of truth of real investigation of real facts trying to understand
[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:52.560]  the truth is trying to be honorable trying to really do the research and we're just proving
[02:47:52.560 --> 02:47:59.520]  right over and over and over and over and over and over again and the system is in total panic
[02:47:59.520 --> 02:48:05.520]  and that's why everywhere the left the right the entire establishment is showing themselves
[02:48:05.520 --> 02:48:10.720]  because they need this new 9-11 and this is the final point because they are gauging this is all
[02:48:10.720 --> 02:48:17.040]  a trial balloon for a world back of stand that's geopolitical from from the uh international
[02:48:17.040 --> 02:48:22.240]  perspective foreign policy but they're also looking at the false flag in the middle of this
[02:48:22.240 --> 02:48:28.720]  depression and rising gas prices and plunging stock market and uh exploding uh commodities
[02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:35.440]  they are looking so the american people don't get mad and have a peaceful revolution a restoration
[02:48:35.440 --> 02:48:41.360]  of the republic at this key point is to predict that they want wars and domestic terror and we
[02:48:41.360 --> 02:48:46.480]  all of us need to get the maximum word out and it's the listeners and the other info warriors
[02:48:46.480 --> 02:48:51.440]  and the other patriots that know about the new world war understand the real paradigm you are the
[02:48:51.440 --> 02:48:57.600]  vanguard you are the leaders the 21st century you are so important at this crossroads they can kill
[02:48:57.600 --> 02:49:04.320]  us individually they can demonize us individually but they can't stop these ideas and as the great
[02:49:04.320 --> 02:49:10.080]  french philosopher victor jugo said no army can stop an idea this time has come or has been done
[02:49:10.080 --> 02:49:15.520]  on the statement from v ideas are bulletproof i'm just made out of flesh and blood waiting to death
[02:49:15.520 --> 02:49:21.920]  the farmer gets the bad guys but ideas ideas are bulletproof and that's the message you gotta go 110
[02:49:22.640 --> 02:49:28.480]  we are making history on the side of good if we beat these people our ancestors will literally
[02:49:28.480 --> 02:49:33.600]  use us as an example to fight the tyranny of their day because there's always people struggling
[02:49:33.600 --> 02:49:38.960]  against good the globalists are in full route this is completely blown up in their face we are
[02:49:38.960 --> 02:49:46.640]  witnessing absolute total history unfold erin and it is just so good to be alive and i'm so blessed
[02:49:46.640 --> 02:49:51.280]  if i died today i don't want to i love wife so much i think i love more than wife is my children
[02:49:51.280 --> 02:49:56.960]  and god but i'm here to tell you if i died today i died fulfilled knowing i did the right thing i
[02:49:56.960 --> 02:50:01.680]  stood up for what was right i didn't buy the propaganda i was demonized and attacked nine
[02:50:01.680 --> 02:50:05.920]  and a half years ago going on the air saying it was an inside job i went on there before it happened
[02:50:05.920 --> 02:50:10.640]  saying it was coming telling the target who they would blame because i could see what they were doing
[02:50:10.640 --> 02:50:17.520]  and we have the truth the truth has legs and is partly said yesterday lies have very short legs
[02:50:17.520 --> 02:50:22.080]  and when people who are good and know the truth and don't care about peer pressure stand up and
[02:50:22.080 --> 02:50:26.480]  tell it like it is it's like that country song we ought to come back in the next segment uh i think
[02:50:26.480 --> 02:50:30.720]  it's erin tip it with you got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything we ought to play a
[02:50:30.720 --> 02:50:37.920]  couple of minutes of that before you close out the show coming in i know uh and he's just there

[02:50:42.640 --> 02:50:47.360]  was right and uh if daddy would have sold down a little more about that you know live in a bigger
[02:50:47.360 --> 02:50:53.280]  house but we always had plenty and at the end of the day daddy's son okay alex we're going to break

[02:54:24.800 --> 02:54:30.880]  play that song alex was talking about tomorrow but alex is absolutely right we're in a fight for the
[02:54:30.880 --> 02:54:37.760]  truth and we have the system who's just perpetuated by lies and we're in this battle over the truth
[02:54:37.760 --> 02:54:44.320]  we're fighting against literally the 1984 system of total deception on purpose reverting the truth
[02:54:44.320 --> 02:54:51.280]  spinning lies to become even deeper lies fighting against a literal uh manual goldstein ben london
[02:54:51.280 --> 02:54:58.080]  myth a guy they had on the shelf to roll out at any time uh and now they've done so at a politically
[02:54:58.080 --> 02:55:02.800]  expedient moment even though their story is falling apart you see everyone attacking alex
[02:55:02.800 --> 02:55:08.560]  jones and the others who've really been pointing out that the emperor is naked all along for all
[02:55:08.560 --> 02:55:14.000]  these years uh but of course it's distracting from so much other important news the falling
[02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:21.520]  economy jerald solante wrote a interesting article today uh called bigger than ben london america's
[02:55:21.520 --> 02:55:27.760]  new public enemy number one trying to put focus on bernanke at the fed and they're very destructive
[02:55:27.760 --> 02:55:34.240]  policy far more destructive than 9 11 or ben london could have been uh while obama grandstands
[02:55:34.240 --> 02:55:40.800]  we have his allies like bill richardson saying killing ben london means obama can pass a climate
[02:55:40.800 --> 02:55:48.560]  bill even deeper in the news today we have the obama administration trying to put a tax on cars
[02:55:48.560 --> 02:55:55.520]  by the mile using an implanted electronic device in the car they say but then they spend that too
[02:55:55.520 --> 02:56:00.880]  and say actually this is not a policy but it'll be implemented after a two-year study but it's
[02:56:00.880 --> 02:56:06.480]  not a policy of the president or his administration but they will be putting uh trackers in your car
[02:56:06.480 --> 02:56:12.480]  for an even greater tax really restricting freedom of travel even more than any gas or highway tax
[02:56:12.480 --> 02:56:20.080]  could uh we have obama we have the fda rather claiming they can seize food without evidence
[02:56:20.080 --> 02:56:25.840]  of contamination why not they don't have to offer proof of osama ben london's death the president's
[02:56:25.840 --> 02:56:31.360]  very bitter at having to prove uh his birth certificate really seemed like a personal battle
[02:56:31.360 --> 02:56:36.640]  there's so much more to get into prince charles telling america it needs to cut down stakes for
[02:56:36.640 --> 02:56:42.720]  the sake of the world after his family just had one of the most lavish weddings ever uh in history
[02:56:42.720 --> 02:56:49.920]  and we have shocking stuff the falling apart of american society detroit uh nearly half of other
[02:56:49.920 --> 02:56:58.720]  people 47 excuse me 47 percent of detroiters are functionally illiterate i'm not reading too well
[02:56:58.720 --> 02:57:04.640]  myself but it's just devastating statistics everything that's being distracted by this big obama
[02:57:05.360 --> 02:57:11.920]  obin london lie but we must fight it back against this system uh we will win the info war and they
[02:57:11.920 --> 02:57:17.120]  can't hide the truth uh we meant to get to calls we'll have to get to him tomorrow alex will be back
