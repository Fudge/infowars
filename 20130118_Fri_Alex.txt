[00:00.000 --> 00:11.960]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:11.960 --> 00:21.200]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:21.200 --> 00:31.840]  It's Friday, January 18th, 2013. It's the Alex Jones Show. I'm Paul Joseph Watson, writer
[00:31.840 --> 00:37.880]  with Infowars.com, filling in for Alex today. And the second half of the show will be presented
[00:37.880 --> 00:44.120]  by the health ranger, Mike Adams. He'll be joined by Representative Steve Toth to talk
[00:44.120 --> 00:50.520]  about the latest with the gun grab news, as well as Dr. Andrew Wakefield, who of course
[00:50.520 --> 00:56.840]  has been vilified for revealing the dangers of vaccines. And coming up shortly, CNN can't
[00:56.840 --> 01:02.720]  get him, but we can. It's the controversial Florida professor who's basically been savaged
[01:02.720 --> 01:08.060]  by the mainstream media for questioning the official narrative behind the Sandy Hook shooting.
[01:08.060 --> 01:14.960]  It's Professor James Tracy, and he'll be live via Skype to take your calls. And of course,
[01:14.960 --> 01:20.060]  if you've been living under a rock for the past few weeks, then the internet is basically
[01:20.060 --> 01:25.680]  aflame with what they're calling Sandy Hook truthers. And there's actually one YouTube
[01:25.680 --> 01:34.680]  video alone which has got over 10.6 million views in the last 10 days alone that talks
[01:34.680 --> 01:40.520]  about some of these questions surrounding the Sandy Hook massacre. So basically, he's
[01:40.520 --> 01:58.640]  been absolutely pillared by the mainstream media. I'm sorry, sorry about that. He's been
[01:58.640 --> 02:05.440]  absolutely pillared by the mainstream media. He was on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 last Friday,
[02:05.440 --> 02:11.800]  I believe it was. And for 25 minutes, Anderson Cooper attacked him, put his picture up on
[02:11.800 --> 02:17.800]  screen. Basically, it was a surprise that there wasn't a wanted sign next to his name.
[02:17.800 --> 02:23.000]  I don't actually believe in all these theories that are circulating about Sandy Hook, but
[02:23.000 --> 02:27.320]  we're going to talk to the professor before the bottom of the hour. We're going to go
[02:27.320 --> 02:32.920]  over some of the questions that he and others have raised about the Sandy Hook massacre
[02:32.920 --> 02:39.480]  and about the backlash that he's faced from the likes of CNN, from the likes of Fox News.
[02:39.480 --> 02:44.040]  So that's going to be a fascinating talk. We're also going to go to your calls at the
[02:44.040 --> 02:51.040]  top of the hour for Professor James Tracy on all things Sandy Hook. But the top news
[02:51.040 --> 02:57.080]  at the moment on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, we've heard about the Nerf gun. We've heard
[02:57.080 --> 03:03.000]  about the kid, you know, being suspended for making a gun sign with his hand. But this
[03:03.000 --> 03:08.360]  one really takes the biscuit. And this took place in Mount Armel, Florida. This is a story
[03:08.360 --> 03:14.680]  just out today. Basically, a five year old girl, a kindergarten girl, had a toy pink
[03:14.680 --> 03:19.840]  gun. It was a Hello Kitty toy pink gun that blew bubbles out of the gun when you pulled
[03:19.840 --> 03:26.000]  the trigger. It's a toy gun for a kindergarten child. She joked with her classmates that
[03:26.000 --> 03:31.960]  she was going to shoot them with her toy pink bubble gun. And of course, the teacher later
[03:31.960 --> 03:38.020]  finds out in this school in Florida, the five year old girl is interrogated without her
[03:38.020 --> 03:46.640]  mother being present for three hours by school officials over a Hello Kitty pink toy bubble
[03:46.640 --> 03:54.600]  gun. And it gets worse. The girl told her mother that school officials actually threatened
[03:54.600 --> 04:02.160]  her with jail time. This is a five year old girl, jail time for making jokes about shooting
[04:02.160 --> 04:08.400]  people with a pink bubble gun. And she was actually suspended. This five year old child
[04:08.400 --> 04:15.440]  was suspended from kindergarten. And get this, school officials as well in this story said
[04:15.440 --> 04:23.460]  that she was making terroristic threats, terroristic threats with the toy pink bubble gun, the
[04:23.460 --> 04:29.840]  Hello Kitty gun. So I mean, this again, just heaps on top of the craziness in the aftermath
[04:29.840 --> 04:36.520]  of Sandy Hook. Is it really any wonder that the number of home school kids in America
[04:36.520 --> 04:42.780]  has swelled by over a million kids in the last decade when we continue to hear stories
[04:42.780 --> 04:47.760]  like this? I mean, you know, talk about the United States of hysteria. This is a five
[04:47.760 --> 04:54.500]  year old girl interrogated for three hours, accused of making terroristic threats, threatened
[04:54.500 --> 05:02.560]  with jail and suspended for a Hello Kitty toy bubble gun. The new year is a great time

[08:05.920 --> 08:17.240]  run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. We're back on the Alex Jones Show. Coming
[08:17.240 --> 08:22.300]  up we've got the fact that James Tracy just talked about the Sandy Hook controversy. But
[08:22.300 --> 08:27.640]  now we're joined on the line by Alex Jones with an emergency alert for gun owners. Alex,
[08:27.640 --> 08:34.080]  welcome to the show. That's right. I've taken a day off to take my son camping and I got
[08:34.080 --> 08:39.920]  up this morning and began reading the articles at infoawards.com and I had to call in here
[08:39.920 --> 08:46.160]  to point out that even infoawards.com and even myself and my great researchers, we tend
[08:46.160 --> 08:53.560]  to under or downplay the full magnitude of this. What's happening is so tyrannical and
[08:53.560 --> 09:00.640]  so sensational in how over the top it is. The globalists have a good chance of actually
[09:00.640 --> 09:05.400]  getting most of our guns if we don't completely wake up. What am I talking about? There are
[09:05.400 --> 09:11.520]  two key articles right now on infoawards.com. What about Big Sis to use the see something
[09:11.520 --> 09:17.640]  say something? Homeland Security spy grid on gun owners. The other, and I saw other
[09:17.640 --> 09:22.920]  articles yesterday about police drills federally funded to take on disgruntled veterans and
[09:22.920 --> 09:27.280]  gun owners. Now regular listeners know this is nothing new. The New York Times four years
[09:27.280 --> 09:31.600]  ago, three years ago, scouts trained to take on terrorists and more. They trained to take
[09:31.600 --> 09:35.720]  guns and kill veterans. The Homeland Security documents say returning veterans are the number
[09:35.720 --> 09:42.120]  one enemy. Gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, constitutionalists, bonballs in the fetters.
[09:42.120 --> 09:47.400]  We've known this was behind the scenes in the documents for at least the last four years.
[09:47.400 --> 09:52.280]  It was going on before that, but it accelerated under Obama. Now I've had a chance yesterday
[09:52.280 --> 09:58.120]  and last time this morning to read the executive orders to really drill into it and it confirms
[09:58.120 --> 10:03.080]  everything they tried to push before all at once, hitting us from over a hundred angles.
[10:03.080 --> 10:09.240]  33 executive orders, a bunch of legislation, a bunch of other actions. They are creating,
[10:09.240 --> 10:14.560]  well they've created the giant Stasi spy force in the name of fighting Al Qaeda. Now they
[10:14.560 --> 10:17.920]  say, don't worry about Al Qaeda. They're actually good guys. Our government's using them in
[10:17.920 --> 10:22.920]  Libya and Syria. That's in the news and they're flipping the whole thing. Now people remember
[10:22.920 --> 10:27.240]  articles we wrote years ago saying why Al Qaeda will be announced because we got the
[10:27.240 --> 10:33.040]  new training manuals and we saw the new training videos where every terrorist is a white person
[10:33.040 --> 10:38.400]  being, quote, reported by a minority. And now the initial scripts are out on four new
[10:38.400 --> 10:45.200]  TV shows, Founding Fathers and others, where it's all white, racist with guns and minorities
[10:45.200 --> 10:50.960]  taking them down. So it's a government organized attempt to push a kind of race war type deal
[10:50.960 --> 10:55.040]  where it's the minorities in the government teamed up against, quote, whites. And that's
[10:55.040 --> 11:00.920]  why you see them on Fox Sports saying all gun owners are racist Klan members. That's
[11:00.920 --> 11:07.040]  why you see Bob Schaefer on CBS saying we've got to have a World War II operation against
[11:07.040 --> 11:11.000]  gun owners like they're Hitler. Folks, you heard the clip. That's why you're hearing
[11:11.000 --> 11:16.680]  that we murdered the children in Sandy Hook. This is a purge of libertarians and conservatives.
[11:16.680 --> 11:22.200]  I'm not saying this for effect. The evidence is incontrovertible. It is an over the top
[11:22.200 --> 11:27.000]  situation. They are definitely going to stage false flags and come after us. I already knew
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.560]  this was happening last year when four TV shows were in development all green lighted
[11:31.560 --> 11:38.280]  down to start airing this year where gun owners are racist murderers. So they're now going
[11:38.280 --> 11:42.120]  to say gun owning is a white thing. And people say, well, that doesn't make any sense. They
[11:42.120 --> 11:47.960]  don't care. This is how communists have taken down other countries. And the banks are using
[11:47.960 --> 11:52.260]  the communist playbook. It doesn't mean they're communists. They use communism at the grassroots
[11:52.260 --> 11:57.680]  with fascism on top of it. So I saw Steve Watson's article. I saw Kurt Nemo's article.
[11:57.680 --> 12:05.120]  I saw him. And they're good articles, but they don't explain. Folks, it's now happening.
[12:05.120 --> 12:10.360]  Everything we warned about. Everything we talked about. Now it's not going to be the
[12:10.360 --> 12:15.560]  TSA is going to be on the highways to stop Al-Qaeda. It's now going to be, and it's
[12:15.560 --> 12:19.360]  already started, gun checkpoints. It's going to be harassment of gun owners. It's going
[12:19.360 --> 12:24.600]  to be saying we're mentally ill. They're already doing this. They already now have new gun
[12:24.600 --> 12:28.680]  questionnaires coming out at the state levels that say, are you a conspiracy theorist? Do
[12:28.680 --> 12:32.760]  you believe in a new world order? You can't have a gun. And if conservatives get into
[12:32.760 --> 12:37.120]  this and go, well, I better just shut up or it'll take my guns, now they have the chilling
[12:37.120 --> 12:42.040]  effect. This is what authoritarians have always done. Notice the world government's not denied
[12:42.040 --> 12:46.400]  now. It's admitted. And they're saying you're a terrorist if you don't accept it. The mainstream
[12:46.400 --> 12:52.520]  media, the government, all of it is an occupying force. We still have talk radio. We still
[12:52.520 --> 12:58.440]  have a lot of the states. People are fighting back. But Paul, it is so over the top. So
[12:58.440 --> 13:03.920]  over the top. And I'm standing on top of Mesa. I hope I'm coming through to you clearly.
[13:03.920 --> 13:08.920]  I'm up here hiking. Can you hear me, Paul? Yeah. Loud and clear. Okay, good. I climbed
[13:08.920 --> 13:12.280]  on top of a mountain, literally a small mountain. It's like a pretty good cell range. There's
[13:12.280 --> 13:17.040]  no cell out here where I'm going to have to hike in with my family. So this is what it
[13:17.040 --> 13:23.480]  comes down to, ladies and gentlemen, is that we are in deep, deep, deep, deep, deep emergency
[13:23.480 --> 13:28.200]  trouble. Everything we've talked about is coming true. I'm not happy about that. I'm
[13:28.200 --> 13:32.120]  not happy now that people all over the country are saying Alex Jones is the leader of the
[13:32.120 --> 13:36.720]  resistance, Alex Jones, this and that. But I am happy that we at least got the word out
[13:36.720 --> 13:41.440]  beforehand until we got a chance to beat these people. But I'm not happy it got this far.
[13:41.440 --> 13:46.600]  This is not fun. This is real, folks. This is real. And a mainline conservative talk
[13:46.600 --> 13:52.200]  show host won't realize how much trouble we're in and get hardcore now. It's over. Notice
[13:52.200 --> 13:56.120]  they preconditioned us before all this happened. There's no world government. Nobody wants
[13:56.120 --> 14:00.240]  your guns. The Federal Reserve isn't private. None of this is going to happen. There won't
[14:00.240 --> 14:05.960]  be any carbon taxes. And now they're just doing it all. It is now all happening in mass.
[14:05.960 --> 14:10.680]  I'm going to let you get back to the broadcast. The good news is, as you pointed out, there's
[14:10.680 --> 14:15.840]  more than 30 million views, 10 million on one video alone on YouTube, about Sandy Hook
[14:15.840 --> 14:20.080]  hoaxes. I haven't even gotten into the hoax. I think it smells to high heaven. I don't
[14:20.080 --> 14:23.880]  know how deep it goes. I know they staged the Batman thing. Even Larry Pratt says it
[14:23.880 --> 14:29.520]  has evidence of that. We know they staged Fast and Furious. They could stage anything.
[14:29.520 --> 14:33.080]  Put nothing past them. But the fact that, and that's conservative when I say 30 million
[14:33.080 --> 14:37.840]  views, one video's got like 11 million, one's got 10 million. I mean, in fact, the only
[14:37.840 --> 14:41.480]  time I lie is I underestimate because I don't want to say the truth. There's like 100 million
[14:41.480 --> 14:46.840]  views from what I've seen. Okay, I said 30, that was wrong. Okay, it's like 100 million
[14:46.840 --> 14:52.920]  views of people saying they don't buy Sandy Hook. The media is panicking. No one believes
[14:52.920 --> 14:57.560]  them anymore. That's why they're moving. They're not trying to take over because they're strong.
[14:57.560 --> 15:01.400]  They're trying to take over because they are weak. They're trying to take over because
[15:01.400 --> 15:07.880]  they know the people are waking up. So black, white, Hispanic, old, young, north, south,
[15:07.880 --> 15:12.920]  east, west, we have been taken over. Obama got the taxes raised on poor people. Obama
[15:12.920 --> 15:17.280]  promised not to come after the guns. Obama promised all this stuff. The Republicans are
[15:17.280 --> 15:20.960]  going to go along with total open borders to gut the country. Everything's about to
[15:20.960 --> 15:25.760]  happen this year. That's why they're trying to mobilize their minions and dumb down soccer
[15:25.760 --> 15:31.560]  moms to go after our guns. We have to get back in their face and say, how dare you compare
[15:31.560 --> 15:35.560]  gun owners to Nazi Germany and the government has to have a war against them. How dare you
[15:35.560 --> 15:40.960]  call us Klan? How dare you say we're criminals? How dare you say we killed those kids? How
[15:40.960 --> 15:44.640]  dare you try to put that guilt on us? They are branding us. Here's the key. I'm going
[15:44.640 --> 15:50.520]  to get off. We are being branded as the terrorists right now. We are being branded. We are being
[15:50.520 --> 15:57.400]  branded. The secret program that I discovered years ago that we forced out to go public
[15:57.400 --> 16:03.160]  from our law enforcement sources that are patriots is now going public. They are going
[16:03.160 --> 16:08.440]  ahead with saying gun owners and conservatives are terrorists and that we're not going to
[16:08.440 --> 16:14.160]  be able to own guns. This is a Soviet-style purge like the Reds did to the White Russians
[16:14.160 --> 16:20.400]  in 1917. Ladies and gentlemen, they are declaring a concerted homeland security program of harassment
[16:20.400 --> 16:27.520]  and intimidation against gun owners. Obama must be impeached now. He is an absolute criminal
[16:27.520 --> 16:30.680]  and you must call every member of Congress and let them know that you're fully aware
[16:30.680 --> 16:34.960]  of what's happening because they know they've all committed crimes and insider trading.
[16:34.960 --> 16:38.300]  They know that they're bringing the country down. They know they're imploding the derivatives.
[16:38.300 --> 16:42.080]  They know they brought in the new world order. They know they've done all of this and so
[16:42.080 --> 16:46.320]  they want to lock us up the opposition to their criminal activities. They want to say
[16:46.320 --> 16:50.520]  that real Americans know what's happening are terrorists. This is so outrageous. We
[16:50.520 --> 16:58.000]  have to use their leap, their power grab to boomerang back on them. They are going for
[16:58.000 --> 17:03.000]  everything right now. They have overreached. But if we don't respond, they are going to
[17:03.000 --> 17:06.320]  win. I'm telling you folks, they're going to come and arrest you. They're going to take
[17:06.320 --> 17:11.440]  your property. Even if you've never fought for liberty and you've got property or a business
[17:11.440 --> 17:17.200]  owner, they're going to take everything you've got. They want a hot, quick takeover of America.
[17:17.200 --> 17:21.880]  Look how much has happened. The Obamacare, the bankruptcy, the NAFTA, the gap, the Chinese
[17:21.880 --> 17:26.640]  owning our debt, the Chinese government saying they want our guns turned in a month ago,
[17:26.640 --> 17:33.760]  the UN treaty, the UN running our military. You ain't seen nothing, nothing, nothing yet.
[17:33.760 --> 17:38.640]  We are being declared terrorists on television right now. They are saying gun owners are
[17:38.640 --> 17:44.400]  the Nazis like of World War II and the government can take us out. This is outrageous. They
[17:44.400 --> 17:50.400]  are now branding us as terrorists worldwide. We are being branded to be hunted down and
[17:50.400 --> 17:55.520]  arrested. Paul Watson, the magnitude of this is literally off the charts. What do you say?
[17:55.520 --> 18:00.200]  Well, it's downright creepy, isn't it? Because everybody's been asking, well, if they get
[18:00.200 --> 18:03.560]  the assault weapons ban through, how are they going to enforce it? How are they going to
[18:03.560 --> 18:11.080]  confiscate these weapons? And big sis, DHS has announced that they're going to help expand
[18:11.080 --> 18:17.680]  and prioritize the see something, say something campaign with the express purpose of aiding
[18:17.680 --> 18:22.480]  Obama's gun control. So what does that mean? It was always set up for that. I'm going to
[18:22.480 --> 18:25.880]  get off and let you continue with the article. We need to repost Kurt Nemo's article where
[18:25.880 --> 18:29.600]  the bill is introduced where they make you turn your guns in and then you get a tax credit
[18:29.600 --> 18:35.600]  for it on your taxes. Folks, it's happening. She's announcing that we're the terrorists.
[18:35.600 --> 18:40.280]  In the training videos, every single person is white. I mean, folks, it is on. All you
[18:40.280 --> 18:45.400]  guys that said give our liberties up because of Al Qaeda, you have been fooled. Just like
[18:45.400 --> 18:48.840]  the Obama suckers that thought he was going to cut their taxes. Paul, go over all the
[18:48.840 --> 18:54.240]  articles. Everybody, get them at infoawards.com, prisonplanet.com, get them out to everybody.
[18:54.240 --> 18:59.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is it. And they are going to butcher everything else. They're
[18:59.160 --> 19:02.560]  going to take the pension funds. They're going to gut everything. Paul Watson, big show coming
[19:02.560 --> 19:05.920]  up today with you and Mike Adams is going to sit in for half the show coming up. God
[19:05.920 --> 19:10.200]  bless you all. Ladies and gentlemen, this is it. Toe to toe with the new world order.
[19:10.200 --> 19:14.440]  God bless you. There goes Alex Jones. And I mean, this is
[19:14.440 --> 19:20.800]  an agency of the DHS. Let's not forget that put out a report last year, funded a report
[19:20.800 --> 19:27.020]  that said Americans quote, reverential of liberty and Americans suspicious of centralized
[19:27.020 --> 19:32.920]  authority were basically terrorists. They lumped them in with a bunch of hate groups,
[19:32.920 --> 19:39.560]  racist clan members and terrorist organizations and said that Americans who held those viewpoints
[19:39.560 --> 19:44.080]  were in the same league. I mean, this is an agency that's put out PSAs for the past three
[19:44.080 --> 19:50.840]  or four years, whereas Alex said every terrorist portrayed as white middle class American.
[19:50.840 --> 19:54.800]  That's who they're targeting. And we'll be back after the break with Professor James
[19:54.800 --> 20:03.080]  Tracy. Stay tuned. Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how
[20:03.080 --> 20:07.680]  did we ever survive from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer
[20:07.680 --> 20:12.600]  drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy? Our hearts go out
[20:12.600 --> 20:17.120]  to those that have lost everything at e foods direct. We hear from customers every day that

[20:21.800 --> 20:27.240]  Sandy. Danny from New York City wrote almost all the grocery stores are closed, but I managed
[20:27.240 --> 20:32.280]  to get my e foods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better
[20:32.280 --> 20:37.020]  to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late. I can warn you, but I can't

[21:07.760 --> 21:14.420]  in 2010. Then I learned about RNA drops. I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists
[21:14.420 --> 21:19.360]  have called junk is actually packed with millions of gene switches that play a critical role
[21:19.360 --> 21:24.280]  in controlling how my cells, organs and other tissues behave. I learned I don't have to
[21:24.280 --> 21:28.220]  put up with disease decay or decline like I've been conditioned to believe. I began
[21:28.220 --> 21:34.200]  taking RNA drops, a 100% natural formula designed to turn on those switches and provide me with
[21:34.200 --> 21:39.560]  amazing health and joy. Learn more about RNA drops and order a free sample today. Visit

[22:31.320 --> 22:35.400]  banks, stock workers, investment advisors want to talk about gold IRAs? They've been
[22:35.400 --> 22:40.240]  available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your
[22:40.240 --> 22:45.060]  retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs. If you would like
[22:45.060 --> 22:51.400]  to have gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation
[22:51.400 --> 22:59.480]  and low returns call 800-686-2237. Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237. It's
[22:59.480 --> 23:04.880]  time for a home security quiz. Answer this. What effective home security device is smaller
[23:04.880 --> 23:08.920]  than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while
[23:08.920 --> 23:13.720]  you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments and
[23:13.720 --> 23:20.780]  sells for less than $35? Yes, it's fake TV. This year about one in every 50 US homes will
[23:20.780 --> 23:26.020]  have a break in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like
[23:26.020 --> 23:31.160]  no one is home. Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone
[23:31.160 --> 23:36.600]  is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV. It's like a lamp on a timer
[23:36.600 --> 23:42.100]  but far more convincing. And for only $34.95, fake TV could be the difference between coming
[23:42.100 --> 23:50.480]  home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked. Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV.
[23:50.480 --> 24:01.880]  That's 877-532-5388 or go to faketv.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[24:01.880 --> 24:18.960]  Back on the Alex Jones Show, Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex Jones, Mike Adams coming
[24:18.960 --> 24:23.920]  up in the second half of the show. Top story on Drudge Report right now. TSA to remove
[24:23.920 --> 24:28.920]  controversial X-ray scanners. This is out of the Associated Press. Transportation Security
[24:28.920 --> 24:33.160]  Administration confirms that it is getting rid of airport body scanners that produce
[24:33.160 --> 24:38.680]  a naked image of travelers. So that's kind of a partial victory. Of course, they're still
[24:38.680 --> 24:45.460]  going to use the ones that quote unzip your DNA but apparently now completely phasing
[24:45.460 --> 24:50.600]  out the X-ray body scanners, of course, as a result of numerous controversies over the
[24:50.600 --> 24:57.320]  past several years, led in no small part by drudgereport.com and infowars.com. So that
[24:57.320 --> 25:01.800]  is a victory on that front. Of course, before the break, you heard Alex. He was talking
[25:01.800 --> 25:08.520]  about this new report out of Portsmouth, Ohio, which is up on infowars.com. Drill characterizes
[25:08.520 --> 25:15.540]  disgruntled Second Amendment advocates as terrorists. Basically, they had a safety security
[25:15.540 --> 25:21.400]  exercise involving the police, National Guard and local emergency responders there in Portsmouth,
[25:21.400 --> 25:27.820]  Ohio. And the terrorists in this drill were portrayed as quote, two school employees who
[25:27.820 --> 25:34.480]  are disgruntled over the government's interpretation of the Second Amendment. And in this scenario,
[25:34.480 --> 25:42.480]  they had these pro-gun rights people building weapons of mass destruction, killing teachers
[25:42.480 --> 25:48.560]  and using biological agents against the local community. So they're basically going full
[25:48.560 --> 25:56.320]  lockstep now demonizing Second Amendment advocates amidst this national debate on gun control.
[25:56.320 --> 26:02.980]  So that story is up right now at infowars.com. I'm delighted to be joined now by Professor
[26:02.980 --> 26:10.220]  James Tracy, Ph.D. from Florida Atlantic University. He's a tenured communications professor and
[26:10.220 --> 26:16.440]  he also teaches a class entitled Culture of Conspiracy. He's also involved with Project
[26:16.440 --> 26:22.680]  Censored and his website is memorywholeblog.com. Professor, welcome to the show.
[26:22.680 --> 26:28.840]  It's great to be here Paul. Thank you. Now, before we get into Sandy Hook, obviously
[26:28.840 --> 26:33.680]  we're going to go in detail on that. I want to talk about basically the onslaught you've
[26:33.680 --> 26:39.160]  received over the past week by the mainstream media and particularly CNN. As I mentioned
[26:39.160 --> 26:45.180]  earlier, Anderson Cooper literally devoted half of his show last week to attacking Professor
[26:45.180 --> 26:50.620]  Tracy. And then he had another ten minute segment just a couple of days ago doing the
[26:50.620 --> 26:56.800]  same thing. Basically, as far as I saw it, he was trying to get Professor Tracy fired
[26:56.800 --> 27:03.120]  from his position there at the university. So, Professor, CNN could have easily just
[27:03.120 --> 27:07.920]  ignored all this. Why do you think they've attacked you so vigorously for asking questions
[27:07.920 --> 27:12.560]  about Sandy Hook? I think basically to bring me into the news
[27:12.560 --> 27:17.580]  frame and to personalize this between myself and the families of Newtown, it has nothing
[27:17.580 --> 27:21.400]  to do with that. I was bringing up questions that were not raised, that were not addressed
[27:21.400 --> 27:25.400]  by the media. Anderson Cooper is someone who says he's keeping them honest. Well, who's
[27:25.400 --> 27:29.480]  he keeping honest? The poor parents about their grief, or is he keeping people honest,
[27:29.480 --> 27:33.280]  the authorities and so forth there, that have dropped the ball with regard to the investigation
[27:33.280 --> 27:41.040]  or perhaps even covered something up. They contacted me last Friday. I was frankly somewhat
[27:41.040 --> 27:48.080]  exhausted from the entire week after the story went viral. Drudge picked it up on Tuesday.
[27:48.080 --> 27:53.380]  And I spoke with my family members and my wife, and she didn't really want me to go
[27:53.380 --> 27:59.800]  on the show. And so I declined from doing so, and they were very persistent. They in
[27:59.800 --> 28:05.080]  fact actually sent their reporter out here who went to my place of employment, then filmed
[28:05.080 --> 28:09.960]  out in my front lawn pretty much. I was not even aware of that, but he did call and say
[28:09.960 --> 28:15.100]  that he was around the corner. He was a couple blocks away, I guess, wanted me to come out.
[28:15.100 --> 28:21.520]  And I said, look, I'm really not into it. I'm tired. I will consider it in the future.
[28:21.520 --> 28:26.360]  I will provide a statement to you. I provided an email statement. It took me an hour or
[28:26.360 --> 28:31.280]  so to compose. They used a snippet of it or two on the air, and that was it. But other
[28:31.280 --> 28:38.720]  than that, it was really an attack. I was really rather taken aback by the extent of
[28:38.720 --> 28:44.880]  it. They contacted me again earlier this week, and on Monday I said, well, I will consider
[28:44.880 --> 28:50.120]  it on Tuesday. They said, well, it's time. Do you want to go ahead and do it? And they
[28:50.120 --> 28:54.360]  wanted to get me down to the studio right away. And I said, I've got to teach this evening.
[28:54.360 --> 28:59.100]  I really don't have the time, but I will consider doing it. I've contacted them again and they've
[28:59.100 --> 29:05.440]  not responded. So you're perfectly willing to go on there. You've contacted them and
[29:05.440 --> 29:10.920]  now they've basically stopped talking to you. Is that the case? That's the case. Yes. So
[29:10.920 --> 29:15.440]  maybe, you know, maybe they've dropped the story. I mean, to my, I watched the clip,
[29:15.440 --> 29:20.880]  the 20 minute thing where Cooper's demonizing you. And it seems obviously he's using, you
[29:20.880 --> 29:24.880]  know, you're insulting the victims as his platform for what he's saying. But he also
[29:24.880 --> 29:30.240]  seemed just as annoyed about the fact that you were questioning whether or not the mainstream
[29:30.240 --> 29:34.320]  media did its job in the first days after the event. So we'll go more into that. We'll
[29:34.320 --> 29:39.000]  talk about Sandy Hook after the break. Stay tuned. This is The Alex Jones Show. We'll
[29:39.000 --> 29:54.240]  be right back. Infowars.com. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones

[33:21.980 --> 33:29.260]  James Tracy about the Sandy Hook massacre. He's a professor who's caused no end of controversy over
[33:29.260 --> 33:36.700]  the past week because he's been heavily demonized by the likes of CNN and Fox News. There's a video
[33:36.700 --> 33:41.580]  on YouTube which came to my attention about a week ago. It's only been posted for about
[33:41.580 --> 33:49.740]  10, 11 days. It's called the Sandy Hook shooting fully exposed. 10.6 million plus people have
[33:49.740 --> 33:56.140]  watched this video in the space of the last 10, 11 days alone. That shows you how voracious the
[33:56.140 --> 34:01.660]  interest is in this whole Sandy Hook issue. And I mean, I'm coming at it from a perspective of
[34:02.460 --> 34:08.460]  there are lots of unanswered questions. I don't buy into the notion that this never happened or
[34:08.460 --> 34:14.140]  that the parents, the family members involved were actors in some sense, which some people
[34:14.140 --> 34:19.820]  have claimed. I think it was a real tragedy. It really happened. But there are plenty of
[34:19.820 --> 34:25.980]  unanswered questions that go along with it that suggest more people than the accused shooter,
[34:25.980 --> 34:30.620]  Adam Lanza, may have been involved. So we're going to get into that now with Professor James Tracy.
[34:32.380 --> 34:39.180]  So Professor, you know, the Obama administration has built its entire gun control move on the
[34:39.180 --> 34:44.460]  notion that Adam Lanza shot these children with an AR-15 assault rifle. They're trying to ban
[34:44.460 --> 34:51.100]  the assault rifles now. Given that, wouldn't it be the perfect poster child to actually have
[34:51.100 --> 34:59.020]  even a still image from a surveillance camera of Adam Lanza with this AR-15 assault rifle
[34:59.660 --> 35:05.020]  when in reality we've seen nothing, no surveillance footage, no still images of the
[35:05.020 --> 35:11.020]  shooter when in past, you know, mass shootings, school shootings, images of the shooter,
[35:11.660 --> 35:17.260]  thinking about Columbine, Virginia Tech, have emerged within days. But of Adam Lanza,
[35:17.260 --> 35:21.420]  we've seen absolutely nothing. Is that one of the questions that you've been talking about?
[35:22.300 --> 35:29.260]  It's a central question, Paul. The Sandy Hook School District installed a new security system
[35:29.260 --> 35:34.220]  in September. Now, this is a very affluent community and they would not have cut corners
[35:34.220 --> 35:40.220]  in terms of video surveillance and the ability to be able to store that video that's taken.
[35:40.220 --> 35:45.980]  So there's a glaring problem here with regard to what is actually going on. Where is that
[35:45.980 --> 35:52.780]  video footage? I think we can safely conclude that there was video footage captured, but where is it
[35:52.780 --> 36:01.980]  now? One scenario is that the one individual or team of individuals went in and went to the
[36:01.980 --> 36:08.060]  main office and may have turned off the video surveillance. But we've not heard from the
[36:08.060 --> 36:13.660]  officials whether or not that is in fact the case. If it was Adam Lanza, would he have had
[36:13.660 --> 36:20.300]  the foresight and sophistication to be able to pull something like that off? If it was a crew,
[36:20.300 --> 36:26.460]  you know, a team of shooters, that may have in fact been the case. That's the only thing that
[36:26.460 --> 36:33.180]  I've heard about possibly explaining why there might not be video surveillance other than just
[36:33.180 --> 36:39.740]  holding back on it and attempting to, for example, doctor it. That's something I believe that Mike
[36:39.740 --> 36:47.020]  Adams had a piece a couple of days ago about where is the surveillance footage. It's a very
[36:47.020 --> 36:52.860]  big question because if they want to put a lot of our queries to rest, they could release that.
[36:52.860 --> 36:58.620]  We could see Lanza committing the crimes and that would be the end of it. Another thing that might
[36:59.660 --> 37:06.460]  point to is that handguns were used because those were what the initial reports stated. In fact,
[37:06.460 --> 37:12.780]  NBC News confirmed the reports from state and federal officials that there were four
[37:12.780 --> 37:19.020]  handguns used. This was on the morning of December 15th, Pete Williams on the NBC Today show.
[37:19.020 --> 37:25.900]  That was changed on the afternoon of December 15th by the Connecticut medical examiner H.
[37:25.900 --> 37:33.900]  Wayne Carver to being the AR-15, solely the AR-15 that was used. That was at the press conference
[37:33.900 --> 37:43.580]  at about 3.30, I believe 3.15, 3.30 p.m. on December 15th. And we had reports that the actual
[37:43.580 --> 37:49.260]  assault rifle was left in the vehicle, but then the video showed the police removing what looked
[37:49.260 --> 37:54.540]  like a shotgun out of the trunk of the vehicle. So do we know, have we pinned down exactly what's
[37:54.540 --> 37:58.380]  going on with the specific weapons that were used or is that still contradictory?
[37:59.020 --> 38:04.220]  I think that it's still contradictory. The footage looks as if it was a shotgun,
[38:04.220 --> 38:12.060]  but altogether there were, I believe there were at least six weapons or seven weapons,
[38:12.060 --> 38:18.380]  if you include at one point or another that somehow materialize on the scene and then disappear.
[38:18.380 --> 38:25.340]  There are the four pistols, there's the AR-15, and then there are two Enfield rifles that are
[38:25.340 --> 38:30.140]  referenced at one point or another in the reportage. So we've got a total of, I believe,
[38:30.140 --> 38:37.100]  at least seven weapons that are mentioned, that are pointed to by officials in journalistic
[38:37.100 --> 38:42.700]  reports and then somehow disappear. And then we are down to the one weapon, the AR-15,
[38:42.700 --> 38:49.260]  which we might at the very least surmise that this is what was one of the things, one of the
[38:49.260 --> 38:54.540]  weapons that looks the most dangerous and the one that might be targeted in legislation and
[38:54.540 --> 39:02.620]  executive orders. Now we've got these reports of two men in the woods, obviously we've all seen
[39:02.620 --> 39:08.380]  all seen the footage of them being apprehended in the woods. One has been explained as a parent who
[39:08.380 --> 39:13.580]  went to the school to help his son bake, I think it was gingerbread men or something,
[39:13.580 --> 39:19.020]  that's kind of been explained. He said he heard the gunshots, he was petrified, he ran away.
[39:19.740 --> 39:25.100]  There was another report of a separate man in the woods though, and it emerged in a Newtown B
[39:25.100 --> 39:31.020]  report, quote, a man with a gun who was spotted in the woods. So this is a guy with a gun around
[39:31.020 --> 39:35.980]  a school massacre. A man with a gun who was spotted in the woods near the school on the day
[39:35.980 --> 39:44.140]  of the incident was an off-duty tactical squad police officer from another town. So why is a
[39:44.140 --> 39:50.460]  guy who's a police officer from another town in the woods outside where a massacre's taking place
[39:50.460 --> 39:55.580]  with a gun? I mean, is that a place where people would go hunting right next to a school?
[39:55.580 --> 40:00.940]  So Professor, just tell us about the reports of additional individuals that may have been involved
[40:00.940 --> 40:09.580]  in this event. Well, the footage, the aerial footage that is taken by the Associated Press
[40:10.300 --> 40:16.860]  shows at least one figure fleeing the scene being pursued by police officers. So if there was
[40:16.860 --> 40:24.460]  someone up in the woods, they must have come back down and then been chased back up into the woods.
[40:24.460 --> 40:31.820]  At one point, about a week or so ago, J. Paul Vance, the Connecticut State Police Lieutenant,
[40:32.380 --> 40:37.100]  said that the individual up in the woods was just chopping wood, just happened to be there
[40:37.100 --> 40:41.020]  chopping wood. Well, maybe they came down to the school and got a drink of water or something and
[40:41.020 --> 40:49.100]  then went back up there. That footage also shows, you can see someone in the upper left-hand portion
[40:49.100 --> 40:56.060]  of the video footage, someone who emerges behind a tree. And they remain unaccounted for, so
[40:56.060 --> 41:02.620]  apparently they escaped. But of course, as you know, there's also the CBS footage of a bystander
[41:02.620 --> 41:10.140]  who remarks that this individual was paraded by them and said to them, the onlookers, that
[41:10.140 --> 41:16.540]  I didn't do it. And then they took the individual and put them in the front seats of the patrol car.
[41:16.540 --> 41:26.300]  I'm very skeptical of accepting the Newtown B as a valid source for information after
[41:26.860 --> 41:32.940]  the really contradictory reports initially from December 14th. First of all, quoting the principal,
[41:32.940 --> 41:38.460]  Dawn Hawksprung, and then retracting that and never saying who actually was that they spoke to.
[41:38.460 --> 41:46.940]  So I'm really very suspicious of that particular medium. And then apparently the individual that
[41:47.740 --> 41:58.460]  was spotted in the parking lot was a parent. That as well, I've not really seen anything that would
[41:58.460 --> 42:11.660]  confirm that. I know that that is out there, but this was an individual that was spotted by a
[42:11.660 --> 42:18.060]  student who was being interviewed, who had experienced the evacuation of the building.
[42:18.060 --> 42:25.180]  And I believe that would have been the alleged parent that somehow fled onto the scene
[42:25.180 --> 42:34.540]  all of a sudden. There are also questions with regard to the alleged photograph of the evacuation
[42:34.540 --> 42:40.860]  of the 15 or 16 students that were being evacuated that really did make the national
[42:40.860 --> 42:49.740]  and international news. That was supposedly taken by one of the Newtown B associate editors
[42:49.740 --> 42:57.740]  as she came onto the scene in the back of the first responders. And she said that she was
[42:57.740 --> 43:04.460]  taking photographs left and right, and yet only two photographs emerged from that series of photos.
[43:05.420 --> 43:12.540]  So there's this conflicting information as well with regard to the additional suspects on the
[43:12.540 --> 43:18.300]  scene, but we've not really been given any conclusive evidence as far as I'm concerned,
[43:18.300 --> 43:25.420]  really, as to who they were and what they were doing there and whether or not they may have been
[43:25.420 --> 43:33.100]  accessories in the crime. Yeah, there are a lot of questions about the lack of children, the lack
[43:33.100 --> 43:38.540]  of parents, the lack of teachers being seen in the actual surrounding area after the massacres
[43:38.540 --> 43:43.660]  happened. Of course, the school was on lockdown for a time, but then everybody was evacuated.
[43:43.660 --> 43:50.380]  I was thinking maybe that's only because the mass media showed up quite a while later after
[43:50.380 --> 44:01.020]  everybody had already been evacuated. That may have been the case. If you note the school shooting
[44:01.020 --> 44:09.740]  at Union, excuse me, Taft Union High School out by Bakersfield, there was media on the scene
[44:09.740 --> 44:18.300]  there, and that's a school comparable in student body to the Newtown, to Sandy Hook. There are
[44:18.300 --> 44:27.340]  about 850, 900 students there, and there's a very evident evacuation taking place there where the
[44:27.340 --> 44:34.220]  sidewalks are flooded with students. But we see none of that in Newtown, and where the students
[44:34.220 --> 44:41.900]  would have converged over at the fire hall, the fire station, there's a limited degree of activity
[44:41.900 --> 44:49.420]  there as well. So some of these things also made me suspicious. Exactly what is going on here?
[44:49.420 --> 44:54.380]  Is this an event that is in some way, shape, or form being embellished? Because I think that
[44:54.380 --> 45:00.380]  something took place there as well, but I'm wondering as to what degree it may be somewhat
[45:00.380 --> 45:08.620]  fortified, if you will. And also, there were these bizarre reports of people dressed as nuns
[45:08.620 --> 45:13.820]  fleeing the scene in a purple van, and then we've got this photograph of these black veils being
[45:13.820 --> 45:19.180]  found near the scene on the ground. Did you hear about that report? Well, yeah, I believe in fact
[45:19.180 --> 45:26.220]  that it was someone who was calling the Alex Jones show on the morning of the incident that reported
[45:26.220 --> 45:34.460]  this initially, and that's the first time that it emerged really on the news. And there was also an
[45:34.460 --> 45:40.300]  article on the intel hub that delves into this to some degree. In fact, I believe there was a
[45:40.300 --> 45:50.140]  photograph taken of these individuals, and they're wearing footwear similar to what police officers
[45:50.140 --> 45:57.340]  would wear. Yeah, I actually saw that photo earlier today. It's definitely bizarre. But I mean,
[45:57.340 --> 46:03.020]  the problem we've got is amidst all these legitimate questions about the narrative, what
[46:03.020 --> 46:08.460]  happened, who was involved, there's a plethora of claims that are obviously either completely
[46:08.460 --> 46:15.580]  baseless or are woefully reductionist. And I think the whole thing about Emily Parker supposedly
[46:15.580 --> 46:21.500]  not being killed and then being included in that photo with Obama is clearly one of them, because
[46:21.500 --> 46:27.580]  if you look at the high res images, you can quite clearly prove that it is in fact her sister, who
[46:27.580 --> 46:33.420]  obviously wasn't one of the victims. So I mean, what do you say to the idea that, you know, some
[46:33.420 --> 46:40.460]  people are really making huge leaps of logic, and in doing so, are detracting from any real
[46:40.460 --> 46:45.740]  understanding of what happened? Because I've seen some really just crazy things like, you know,
[46:45.740 --> 46:51.340]  Robbie Parker, one of the parents is actually Tony Hawk, the skateboard guy. So it's good. There's a
[46:51.340 --> 46:56.540]  lot of people poisoning the well with bizarre craziness. And it's really not helping us
[46:56.540 --> 47:02.620]  understand what actually happened, is it? Well, I've seen a lot of activity on my blog as well,
[47:03.260 --> 47:09.180]  the comments and things of the like. And I, I think that there is definitely a lot of
[47:09.180 --> 47:17.580]  information. There is definitely a program to sow misinformation in the stream of information in
[47:17.580 --> 47:26.780]  order to muddy the waters. And in the process, discredit the research, really the research that
[47:26.780 --> 47:33.820]  independent researchers and the like are putting together and alternative media. Because if you
[47:33.820 --> 47:39.820]  can discredit it or muddy the waters to a limited degree in one area, you can paint with a fairly
[47:39.820 --> 47:47.660]  broad brush, the mainstream corporate media can do that. So I, you know, I'm not very surprised if
[47:47.660 --> 47:54.380]  if things like that are being are being spread. I'm also somewhat suspicious of the, you know,
[47:54.380 --> 48:00.140]  some of the web pages, or some of, for example, a Facebook page that is created a few days ahead of
[48:00.140 --> 48:08.540]  time. These are very curious, curious phenomena. I know less about the phase of the mechanics of
[48:08.540 --> 48:14.060]  Facebook, and the extent to which dates can be changed to really draw any conclusions with with
[48:14.060 --> 48:20.140]  regard with regard to that. And it's somewhat one has to be careful as well.
[48:21.260 --> 48:27.340]  Well, I mean, that is interesting. But for me, it's not proof of anything, because you can create
[48:27.340 --> 48:32.940]  a Facebook page, and then rename it to something else. So the original timestamp on the Facebook
[48:32.940 --> 48:38.460]  page will say, you know, for example, December 10. And then you rename it to something else later
[48:38.460 --> 48:44.940]  on. Also, obviously, I work in, you know, web publishing, and you can change your timestamp
[48:44.940 --> 48:50.220]  as easy as anything. So I mean, that for me, that's, you know, it's quite bizarre, like a lot
[48:50.220 --> 48:55.500]  of the other stuff, but it's not really proof of anything. We're going to get back into the details
[48:55.500 --> 49:00.460]  shortly. I just want to get your take on this. Luis Tambasquio, who was a family friend of the
[49:00.460 --> 49:07.980]  Lanzas, told 60 Minutes, quote, I know he was on medication. Professor, why over a month later,
[49:07.980 --> 49:11.820]  do we not know anything about what psychiatric drugs Adam Lanza was on?
[49:13.180 --> 49:19.740]  I think that this is a very valid question that journalists such as John Rappaport have asserted.
[49:19.740 --> 49:26.620]  Why is it that we don't know what his physician's name is? If he was, in fact, under psychiatric
[49:26.620 --> 49:33.180]  care, or the equivalent, and what types of drugs he may have been on. There's a drug that I've
[49:33.180 --> 49:42.620]  never heard of called, I believe, Tamaft, that he was supposedly on. But again, there's a limited
[49:42.620 --> 49:49.980]  amount of information that's been disclosed by authorities or otherwise.
[49:50.860 --> 49:56.540]  There was actually, talking about disinformation, there was an individual who claimed to be Lanza's
[49:56.540 --> 50:03.740]  uncle, who was circulating around the media a few weeks ago now. And he actually put out the name
[50:03.740 --> 50:09.020]  of the drug that Lanza was supposedly on. Bunch of publications ran with it, including New York
[50:09.020 --> 50:15.340]  Magazine, I think. And it was complete, this info is completely made up. So again, another example
[50:15.340 --> 50:21.020]  of how people are poisoning the well to distract people from understanding what actually happened.
[50:21.020 --> 50:27.020]  But of course, it took nearly six months to get confirmation that James Holmes was on psychiatric
[50:27.020 --> 50:34.860]  drugs. But we still don't know exactly which ones. So again, as you said, I mean, these SSRIs are
[50:34.860 --> 50:41.100]  the elephant in the living room, aren't they? Because while the media will talk about video
[50:41.100 --> 50:46.220]  games and things like that, they won't address the psychiatric drugs that are prevalent amongst
[50:46.220 --> 50:53.100]  almost all of these mass shooters throughout the last 20 years. Well, actually, Sanjay Gupta did
[50:53.100 --> 51:05.900]  a piece on CNN. We'll talk about it after the break, got to leave it left now. We'll be back, stay tuned.

[54:24.620 --> 54:30.460]  He's controversially questioned the official narrative behind the Sandy Hook school shooting,
[54:30.460 --> 54:35.580]  and he's been demonized and attacked by the likes of CNN and Fox News for doing so.
[54:35.580 --> 54:47.260]  I'm going to say your calls for the professor coming up shortly at 800-259-9231. That's 800-259-9231.
[54:47.260 --> 54:52.540]  We were talking about some of the disinformation that gets mixed into all these questions,
[54:52.540 --> 54:59.340]  which kind of poisons the well. And obviously, I believe that this was a horrible tragedy for
[54:59.340 --> 55:05.740]  all the parents involved. And I believe that some of the people who are asking questions about this,
[55:05.740 --> 55:11.820]  not the professor, but a lot of people on YouTube have handled it in a rather insensitive way.
[55:11.820 --> 55:16.540]  Of course, we've had reports about them harassing some of the people who were involved.
[55:16.540 --> 55:23.500]  And basically, it doesn't do us any favors. So we need to treat it, obviously, with extreme caution
[55:23.500 --> 55:29.900]  because it's a very traumatic event. And I think one of the aspects of this, which a lot of people
[55:29.900 --> 55:37.020]  have claimed, professor, is this whole idea that there were, quote, crisis actors who were working
[55:37.020 --> 55:43.020]  with the media to create a fake narrative surrounding this event. And this is where we
[55:43.020 --> 55:48.220]  probably differ. But just give us your take on the whole crisis actors angle. Explain what that is.
[55:49.740 --> 55:59.260]  The crisis actors is a group based out of Denver, Colorado, I believe. And they work in association
[55:59.260 --> 56:06.540]  with the Department of Homeland Security on active shooter drills. So they are involved
[56:06.540 --> 56:17.740]  in playing the roles of bystanders, of perhaps the shooter himself, the victims in some cases,
[56:18.700 --> 56:28.460]  the individuals involved posting things to social media. In other words, they are all encompassing
[56:28.460 --> 56:34.540]  in creating an environment for a lifelike drill. Now, there was a drill that took place,
[56:34.540 --> 56:39.740]  by the way, along these lines. Now, I don't know if crisis actors were involved, but this was in a
[56:39.740 --> 56:47.100]  school for disabled children in Harlem. And the children were absolutely terrified. So in some
[56:47.100 --> 56:54.540]  cases, it's not known whether or not an event is actually taking place, but it's made more lifelike
[56:54.540 --> 56:58.300]  by the crisis actors. Again, I don't know if they were involved in that particular drill. And that's
[56:58.300 --> 57:04.860]  an incident that's sort of foamed beyond the mainstream media radar. But these individuals,
[57:05.580 --> 57:16.860]  they're deployed within the community and they go ahead and they embellish the particular event. So
[57:16.860 --> 57:29.260]  if this were a drill that somehow went live, as we know that, for example, 9-11 and the 7705
[57:29.260 --> 57:36.780]  bombings were, then it would have involved actors along these lines and they would not even know
[57:36.780 --> 57:46.060]  whether or not the drill itself went live. One of the things that made me question in this regard
[57:46.060 --> 57:51.900]  was looking at the video footage as well as the photographic evidence emerging from the scene.
[57:51.900 --> 57:58.140]  And as you had alluded to earlier, there were just, you know, there were few bystanders and
[57:58.140 --> 58:02.780]  the like. There were very few people actually being interviewed when you would think there
[58:02.780 --> 58:08.140]  would be a great many people on the scene. Now, maybe what you say is correct. Maybe the media
[58:08.140 --> 58:15.100]  got there late and there was no photographic or video evidence along those lines. There were just
[58:15.100 --> 58:21.580]  a few people that they could actually interview. But that's one of the reasons that I actually
[58:21.580 --> 58:27.180]  put that forward. The possibility of there being crisis actors. And I think it's probably been the
[58:27.180 --> 58:32.620]  most controversial. Okay, we'll be back after the break. Stay there. Your calls for Professor
[58:32.620 --> 58:35.500]  Tracy coming up. It's the Alex Jones Show. Stay tuned.

[01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:21.180]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:29.420]  It's Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex Jones today. We're talking to Professor James
[01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:35.020]  Tracy of Florida Atlantic University. He's questioned the official narrative behind the
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:41.580]  Sandy Hook School massacre and basically being pursued by CNN as a result of it and other news
[01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:52.380]  organizations. We're going to go to your calls shortly. The number is 800-259-9231. That's 800-259-9231.
[01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:58.620]  Before the break, we were talking about the idea that some of these individuals involved in this
[01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:04.300]  event may have been actors or participants in a drill. Of course, we know that drills
[01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:11.100]  shadow both 9-11 and 7-7. And you have to frame all this while being sensitive to the
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:17.260]  fact that it was, according to my mind, a very real tragedy involving very real victims. But
[01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:22.940]  you have to frame it in the context that under Fast and Furious, the Obama administration
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:31.980]  sent 2,000 assault weapons to drug lords in Mexico, resulting in the deaths of over 300
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:37.660]  people, many of them children. So to claim that this would be beyond the government to
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:45.500]  stoop to such a level to kill 20 kids to ram through their political agenda is somewhat
[01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:52.380]  naive, given what we've seen historically with the likes of Operation Gladio and other false flag
[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:57.900]  terror programs, which are on the record all admitted. They've been subject to parliamentary
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:04.940]  investigations in countries like Italy, admitted that government stage mass shootings, they stage
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:12.460]  bombings, they bomb trains for their own political agenda. So asking questions about an event that
[01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:20.300]  has been the fulcrum of the Obama administration's agenda on gun control is only sensible while,
[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:26.380]  of course, maintaining that respect, that dignity, that sensitivity for the victims.
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:32.220]  But what sprung to my mind before the break is, professor, straight after the collapse
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:39.100]  of the Twin Towers on 9-11, we had people on the ground who seemed to know, bizarrely,
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:44.700]  intricate details of how that collapsed happened, which just happened to then morph almost
[01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:49.420]  immediately into the official story. So I guess that's what you're talking about when you're
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:53.020]  talking about acts as being involved. You're not saying there were no victims. You're just
[01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:57.180]  saying that people may have been there to massage the narrative. Is that correct?
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:05.420]  Yes, that's correct, Paul. I am simply posing questions, and I never said anything
[01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:11.980]  declarative in any of my articles about this happened. I was saying, could this be a
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:20.940]  possibility? And yet the media took that and ran with it, took my assertion as an allegation when
[01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:25.740]  it was merely a question. And that, unfortunately, is how this has been framed and how I think
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:32.460]  that it's been offensive, especially to the people that lost their loved ones up there in
[01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:38.540]  Newtown. I never actually intended that in any way, shape, or form. But certainly, yes,
[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:46.540]  what you point out with regard to 9-11 is really right on, in that this idea that a
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:54.220]  steel-frame building could collapse as a result of the heat from the airplanes, I think, is
[01:03:54.220 --> 01:04:03.340]  something that was put out there at the time to sort of deflect any questioning as to how could
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:09.260]  this have actually taken place, these buildings going down in such a way, in their own footprint.
[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:15.020]  Just got a minute to go to the break. We're going to go to your call, the first of which is
[01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:21.260]  Adam. We'll go to him after the break. Other aspects that I want to get into, obviously,
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:27.260]  we've got things about Adam Lanza's car, a picture with all four doors open. Why would that be the
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:32.700]  case if he was just exiting the car on his own? As you mentioned earlier, the school principal
[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:37.740]  gives the quote to the Newtown B describing the attack, but she's actually the first victim of the
[01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:43.500]  attack. That's another inconsistency that hasn't been explained. We'll go into it and more with
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:50.380]  your calls. Professor Tracy, after the break, this is the Alex Jones show, infowars.com. Stay tuned.
[01:04:50.380 --> 01:05:14.860]  We'll be right back.

[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:21.420]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:29.260]  It's Paul Joseph Watson, writer with Infowars.com, filling in for Alex today.
[01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:35.100]  Got a headline up on PrisonPlanet.com. Holder begs courts to stop document release on Fast and
[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:41.340]  Furious. Basically, they're trying to stop a lawsuit brought by Judicial Watch asking them
[01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:47.900]  to open records relating to Operation Fast and Furious, which, of course, was the program which
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:53.820]  many view as a deliberate effort to undermine the Second Amendment, where the Obama administration
[01:08:53.820 --> 01:09:01.820]  sent 2,000 assault weapons to drug lords in Mexico, leading to the deaths of 300 people.
[01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:08.780]  If you think it's beyond the Obama administration to engage in murder to further their gun control
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:15.420]  agenda, remembering the fact that it was Obama himself back in April 2011 who told Sarah Brady
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:21.260]  in a White House meeting he was working, quote, under the radar to sneak attack the Second
[01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:27.580]  Amendment, then we'd be very naive to think that they wouldn't engage in such activity.
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:33.820]  We're talking to Professor James Tracy about the Sandy Hook Massacre, the questions that he's
[01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:40.540]  raised about the event and subsequently being attacked by the media for asking. Adam in Canada,
[01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:46.220]  you're on the air. Go ahead, Adam. Yeah, kudos for having the courage to cover this. I have a
[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:53.820]  couple questions. Go ahead. Yeah, I think it's great that he got the thing about the shotgun
[01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:59.180]  in the trunk, right, and the dress with the daughter. Those are up there. But what I haven't
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:05.340]  heard, I'd like to hear him talk about is the question of whether or not that was Adam Lanza's
[01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:12.380]  car. And also if you've seen some of the rebranding of businesses in the area, if you go to
[01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:20.300]  sandyhookhairco.com, Sandy Hook Hair Company, and see their whole image, their whole bloody
[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:25.820]  handprint and the white heart in the palm. And finally, of course, the whole thing about the
[01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:31.340]  Batman map in the movie, the Batman movie, having Sandy Hook on it and also actually lining up to
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:35.980]  the roads in Newton with a circle on the school, which is the stadium that's attacking the movie.
[01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:45.020]  Go ahead, professor. Okay, well, there's quite a bit there. First, with regard to Adam Lanza's car,
[01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:56.780]  this was apparently registered to a Chris Rodia. And yet there was an article that came out
[01:10:56.780 --> 01:11:07.100]  arguing that this was not the case. I think it was in a Hearst paper that the car was not
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:15.900]  registered to him. But in fact, it turns out that it was and that Rodia, you know,
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:23.980]  he had a number of run-ins with the law. He had been involved apparently in drug
[01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:31.980]  running and the like. So that's as much as I know with regard to the automobile.
[01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:40.060]  And what were the other questions? Well, there's this crazy rebranding of businesses with
[01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:46.380]  Illuminati symbology. I mean, it's totally out there, but go to sandyhookhairco.com and you'll
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:51.660]  see their website with the bloody red handprint and the whole thing, white heart in the palm.
[01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:58.380]  And then, of course, the whole Batman movie map, Sandy Hook. Go to YouTube,
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:02.380]  Batman map, Sandy Hook, a strange comparison. You'll see this one-minute video.
[01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:09.900]  I've seen that, professor, but I mean, there's a place, obviously, Gotham City is based on New
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:15.020]  York City and there's a place in New York City called Sandy Hook. That's how I understood it.
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:23.100]  Yeah, and that does come up, but I think one hour and 58 minutes into The Dark Knight Rises,
[01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:28.780]  there's that specifically on the map, from what I understand. I haven't seen the movie in its
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:36.620]  entirety. And somehow I saw that on my blog just recently, someone putting something in there with
[01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:42.940]  regard to the hair salon or the hair company, but I've not seen the actual imagery itself.
[01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:49.580]  So I can't really comment on that. Okay, thanks for the call. Yeah, I think the thing with the
[01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:56.140]  car was, how I read it, it was like a bleed in the police transmission tapes, where he had been
[01:12:56.140 --> 01:13:01.020]  apprehended in a completely different city and that bled through to their transmission, which
[01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:05.580]  is why it got confused with Adam Lanza. That's how it was explained, whether that's true or not.
[01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:16.540]  It was explained in a mainstream media outlet that he was mistaken, but whether or not that
[01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:25.180]  is in fact the case is still somewhat questionable. But it's a very good question.
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:30.860]  And the other stuff doesn't really, I mean, it's all very weird, but it doesn't prove anything for
[01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:38.220]  me. Father James in California, you're on the air, go ahead. Good morning. It's good to talk
[01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:46.220]  to you. I've been a listener of the show probably about a year and initially thought that Alex was
[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:52.540]  rather paranoid until I began researching everything that he was talking about and finding
[01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:59.660]  so much support and information. I have family members that are educators. My father served
[01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:08.460]  in special forces in Vietnam. And the kind of false flag attack is something that I've heard
[01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:15.500]  about from him. In Vietnam, he said it was a common tactic for them to go into a Vietnamese
[01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:22.300]  village, do attacks, leave evidence of it being North Vietnamese or Viet Cong, then come in
[01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:30.140]  in subsequent days to respond to their outrage and recruit them and train them to fight against the
[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:35.420]  North Vietnamese. So it's a tactic that's been around for a long time.
[01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:41.820]  And thinking about these questions, my thoughts have been that the conversation in the media,
[01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:47.820]  especially as it's put out by the government, is how many lives will we save by banning guns?
[01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:53.660]  And I think the question really needs to be turned around. How many lives are we going
[01:14:53.660 --> 01:15:02.140]  to sacrifice if we limit or restrict guns from law-abiding citizens? And I think a very practical
[01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:09.980]  way to arm our teachers, we have a lot of police chiefs and sheriffs that are standing up now
[01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:14.540]  saying that they're going to defend Second Amendment rights. A very simple approach would
[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:20.860]  be for them to issue conceal and carry permits to teachers, and then to overcome the ban or
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:29.820]  guns at school is to deputize them. Sheriffs, police chiefs can deputize citizens in service
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:35.980]  so they can train them, license them, deputize them, and it'll be legal for those teachers
[01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:43.420]  to have a firearm concealed on campus. Well, professor, would you, professor,
[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:49.500]  would you feel safer if your kids were in a school where you knew the teacher had a safely
[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:54.460]  locked away gun in the event of some crazed killer coming into the school? I mean, would
[01:15:54.460 --> 01:16:04.140]  you feel safer? Well, I certainly know that individuals such as Barack Obama, his children
[01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:09.980]  go to a school that is safe and secure in that regard and has armed guards. I think
[01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:15.340]  that's likely the case with many of the, many of the country's elite and the, you know,
[01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:22.140]  the elite of the world. They, most of their children go to, you know, go to facilities,
[01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:27.340]  go to institutions that have that type of security. So why shouldn't the broader public?
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:33.100]  And of course, Obama just signed the bill where he gets lifetime armed secret service
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:41.180]  protection. While all the rest of you lowly peasant American citizens are disarmed, Jacob
[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:46.620]  in Illinois, you're on the air, Jacob, go ahead. Oh, hi. I've been a listener for a
[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:53.820]  couple of days now. I like the show. I was wondering what kind of gun was it again that
[01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:59.420]  the kids were killed with? Like a big rifle or something? I was just wondering, how did he,
[01:16:59.420 --> 01:17:03.020]  how did he get it into the school in the first place?
[01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:09.420]  Professor, that's what the medical examiner addressed, isn't it? If you want to cover it
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:17.820]  from that angle. Yeah, this came up, this is when the story was, was significantly altered
[01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:24.860]  during that press conference from, as far as, as far as I can tell from the, the four handguns,
[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:31.740]  which is what was being reported at eight o'clock or eight thirty a.m. on the NBC Today show
[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:37.100]  to the single AR-15. And during that press conference, and it's important to really look
[01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:42.780]  at that press conference, because I think that's really the most revealing piece of evidence and
[01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:52.140]  information in this case, is that this is the weapon is almost changed immediately from the,
[01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:59.260]  from the, from the pistols to the AR-15. And even a reporter says, speaks up and says,
[01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:05.100]  but the, the rifle was found in the car. And at that point, the Connecticut State
[01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:10.620]  Police Lieutenant Vance said, that's not correct, sir. That's not correct. So it's at that point
[01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:17.340]  where, where things change. How he, now how he got the weapon into the, into the school? Well,
[01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:22.700]  he, he approached the, according to the official story, he approached the entrance of the school
[01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:29.180]  and he, he shot, shot out the, the front, the front door and with a hole big enough to,
[01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:34.540]  to enter. Yet we've not seen any video evidence that that in fact took place,
[01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:39.420]  nor has there been any video or photographic evidence of the, the door itself, the entry point
[01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:46.620]  itself. Thanks for the call, Jacob. Josh in California, you're on the air with Professor
[01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:56.460]  Tracy, go ahead. All right, Josh has dropped. Professor, tell us about the, this pejorative
[01:18:56.460 --> 01:19:02.060]  term conspiracy theory you wanted to talk about, the dynamics between how that's being used by the
[01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:10.940]  establishment media in relation to this event. Well, I think that as, as an academic, and I
[01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:17.100]  think this is also the case with regard to journalists, they fear being called a, a
[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:23.980]  conspiracy theorist. That is the pejorative that's being used against me to make an example out of
[01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:31.500]  me, to threaten my job, to get me to, to be quiet, to not ask questions. It's important to think
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:38.300]  about the, the how this term originated, how actually it developed. There's an important
[01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:43.900]  book called Conspiracy Theory in America that's being, that's coming out in April of this year
[01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:50.140]  by a colleague of mine, Lance DeHaven Smith up at Florida State University. Now he helped to
[01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:55.980]  devise the, the concept of state crimes against democracy. This is something that's wrong. We'll
[01:19:55.980 --> 01:20:00.860]  be back, final segment, we'll finish that after the break. Stay tuned, Alex Jones showing. Looking
[01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:06.380]  back on 2012, we asked ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters like hurricane
[01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:11.260]  Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous
[01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:16.140]  economy? Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods Direct, we hear from

[01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:06.540]  45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:11.500]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical,
[01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:16.620]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line. Is this a flaw for the enterprise or is our
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:21.660]  monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation
[01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:26.300]  and higher taxes? These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book,
[01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:31.100]  The Creature from Jekyll Island. Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know

[01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:15.260]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show, Paul Joseph Austin filling in for Alex, talking with Professor
[01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:20.380]  James Tracy of Florida Atlantic University. Professor, just finish up your thought there
[01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:29.500]  quickly about the term conspiracy theory. Yeah, in the mid-1960s, Paul, the US government,
[01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:35.180]  the Central Intelligence Agency were concerned with regard to the, with regard to criticisms
[01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:43.180]  of the Warren Report, so they issued a dispatch to all of their offices. And this dispatch right
[01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:53.100]  here, it's number 1035-960, it's available at the JFK Lancer website, talks about how,
[01:24:54.140 --> 01:24:59.180]  can I read a bit of this, is that okay? Yeah, we'll push for time, but yeah, quickly.
[01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:05.180]  Okay, well it talks about the, how public opinion is almost 50% skeptical of the official
[01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:11.420]  conclusions of the Warren Commission Report, and talks further about employing propaganda
[01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:17.500]  assets to negate and refute the attacks of the critics. Talks specifically about conspiracy
[01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:26.300]  theories and how to, the specific techniques that one could use in CIA asset publications and by CIA
[01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:35.980]  assets themselves in the media industry to essentially subdue any sort of criticism.
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:41.100]  And so what I'm getting at in that regard, and you could, again, go to the JFK Lancer site and
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:45.420]  read it since we're pressed for time, but I believe it's a key document because this is
[01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:53.020]  something that has, it has in many ways really created fear among journalists and among scholars
[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:57.980]  to address anything that might be considered a conspiracy theory. I think I know this more
[01:25:57.980 --> 01:26:04.140]  intimately than anyone because I, you know, I can sense that fear among, among others. You can't
[01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:10.540]  touch certain, certain subjects such as 9-11 because you might be accused of this, and this
[01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:16.300]  is something that could, it could cost you your, your job and, or your credibility.
[01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:21.100]  Okay. Todd in Florida, quickly, please. Final call. Go ahead, Todd.
[01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:25.820]  Thanks for taking my call, guys. I got some points about Sandy Hook. Thanks so much for
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:29.580]  talking about it today. I think it's something we all need to question. You mentioned at the
[01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:34.220]  press conference, I feel that that is some very important information. Paul Vance dodged
[01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:39.740]  blatantly a question when asked, what was Nancy Lanza's connection to the school? And I believe
[01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:43.820]  that he couldn't answer that question because later it came out that she had no connection.
[01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:50.860]  However, there was a report on the scene from Sally Cox, the 15 year alleged nurse at Sandy Hook,
[01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:57.020]  who told a reporter that she knew Nancy Lanza and that she was an experienced kindergarten teacher.
[01:26:57.020 --> 01:27:02.540]  I think we need to question those things very, very much. Are you also familiar,
[01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:08.940]  are you also familiar with the fundraiser sites that the URLs were created before the event?
[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:15.020]  Yeah, we talked about that a bit earlier. I don't know if a medical examiner would,
[01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:20.860]  would actually have that information. What I would expect of him as a professional is to have
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:26.620]  information specific to the injuries, you know, the causes of death, the caliber of the bullets,
[01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:32.940]  how many girls, how many boys were, were, were slain. These things are just basic and they were
[01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:40.220]  not addressed by Dr. Carver, not in any competent way. And that's the, that's really the major thing
[01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:46.540]  that contributes to my skepticism and caused my, you know, my, my, my initial questioning of the
[01:27:46.540 --> 01:27:53.100]  event. Okay, thanks for the call, Todd. Professor, just tell people about your website, the other
[01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:59.660]  work you do there, how people can find out more information. Yeah, memoryholeblog.com. I've been,
[01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:05.740]  I've had the website since March. There's a lot of stuff on there, you know, primarily there's,
[01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:13.900]  there are essays that, that I've written on, you know, political criticism and, and events such as
[01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:20.460]  this and things that might be regarded as, as conspiracies, but attempting to analyze those
[01:28:21.180 --> 01:28:27.340]  and develop those in a, in a historical context and in a more contemporary context. So it's
[01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:34.300]  memoryholeblog.com. Okay, Professor James Tracy, Florida Atlantic University.
[01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:39.100]  You won't be on CNN tonight then, but you may be on in the next few days.
[01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:44.540]  Well, they've got to get back to me and I'm, I'm willing to, to go on and keep them honest.
[01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:50.460]  Okay, we really appreciate your time. Fascinating questions raised once again,
[01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:53.340]  and we hope to talk to you again soon. Thank you very much.
[01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:58.300]  Thanks Paul. There goes Professor James Tracy raising
[01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:04.220]  questions about the Sandy Hook massacre. And again, this has gone completely viral. It even
[01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:13.340]  surprised me how crazy insane the interest in this is 10.6 million views on one video alone on
[01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:18.940]  YouTube that was created just 10, 11 days ago. And in fact, we're probably going to try and get
[01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:25.500]  the creators behind that video on the show. But tons of videos, tons of questions while
[01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:31.420]  still trying to maintain respect, dignity for the realization that this was a very real tragedy,
[01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:36.620]  but we'll continue to ask questions about it. Mike Adams coming up. This is the Alex Jones
[01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:42.140]  show live. I've been Paul Joseph Watson, infowars.com. We'll be right back with Mike Adams.
[01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:52.700]  Stay tuned. We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:30:02.460]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Alex Jones here with a message to fellow
[01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:07.900]  freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to
[01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:13.980]  worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they
[01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:18.060]  acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled the most vital and important

[01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:30.300]  the next hour and a half here i want to thank paul joseph watson for his eye-opening interview
[01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:36.540]  there i didn't catch all of it because i was obviously uh driving in for to be here but we've
[01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:42.060]  got even more great information coming up this is just hard hitting day after day hour after hour
[01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:45.580]  here's what we have coming up right now on the phone with us and he'll be joining us in just a
[01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:52.220]  minute is representative steve toath from texas who is the person introducing the firearms
[01:33:52.220 --> 01:33:58.700]  protection act that he was on the show i think two days ago here with alex and he's got more updates
[01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:03.500]  for us and i have some new questions for him as well so we'll get an update on that we've also
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:10.940]  got today i'm going to give you just a little commentary on lance armstrong and his now staged
[01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:15.820]  confession that he lied all along and all the people that he bullied and threatened and
[01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:21.980]  intimidated were actually correct in saying that he doped so give you a little breakdown on that
[01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:25.340]  but i'm not going to spend too much time on that because there's far more important things happening
[01:34:25.340 --> 01:34:31.660]  in this world than lance armstrong's career we've got smart gun rfid technology now being discussed
[01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:40.300]  for uh firearms this is part of obama's 23 now famous or infamous executive orders new ways to
[01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:46.860]  track firearms owners and the new york pd is also even now suggesting that they should put rfid
[01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:52.940]  chips into your medication that's what they want to track is your drugs and your guns and your
[01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:58.540]  money your cash and probably everything else oh it's getting crazy in any case let's go to
[01:34:58.540 --> 01:35:04.060]  representative steve toath who is on the line with us and he joins us for an update mr toath thank
[01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:09.100]  you for joining us once again here on the alex jones show thanks so much mike i appreciate it
[01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:15.660]  it's great to have you on i heard your interview a couple of days ago i'm i'm very proud that you
[01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:21.100]  are the kind of person who represents the state of texas you're a business owner you're a successful
[01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:26.700]  person in the private space your private industry and you get it about the second amendment about
[01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:30.700]  freedom you're well spoken you're highly intelligent i i think your bill is going to be
[01:35:30.700 --> 01:35:36.140]  very successful what is your read so far on the level of support for this firearms protection act
[01:35:36.140 --> 01:35:41.500]  well there think about this for a second there there there are two elements that are really
[01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:47.900]  critical for this bill going through one is the people of the state of texas and the second is
[01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:56.940]  the lawmakers here in austin and um we have all been shocked and it just i mean i knew it was
[01:35:56.940 --> 01:36:00.940]  an issue and it's not just about the second amendment this is really more about the tenth
[01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:07.100]  amendment than it is the second amendment this is about preserving states right this is about
[01:36:07.740 --> 01:36:15.180]  this is about an executive order an edict by a king not having prominence over
[01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:22.060]  um over the legislative process that's laid out in both the texas and in the west constitution
[01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:31.100]  right and so where things are going really well with this legislation is out in the out in the
[01:36:31.100 --> 01:36:36.940]  streets in in homes and businesses and restaurants all over texas people are talking about it
[01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:41.340]  the problem is that there are compete there are going to be some competing bills that are more
[01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:47.500]  moderate we don't need a moderate approach to a desperate problem that is facing america
[01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:55.740]  um we need a strong bill that has real teeth that day one when it goes into effect
[01:36:56.700 --> 01:37:01.020]  the obama administration is going to file an injunction in the fifth circuit probably
[01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:05.580]  to put a stop to it so that this gets challenged all the way to the supreme court
[01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:10.940]  and that's what we need we need this is what that is exactly what we need and so if a moderate bill
[01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:18.060]  goes through without any teeth that they can just overlook and ignore then that's what will happen
[01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:22.780]  so there are a lot of different bills right now but we need for people in the state of texas to
[01:37:22.780 --> 01:37:27.980]  get behind the firearms protection act because that is the bill that is the legislation that
[01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:33.180]  it has the teeth in it that the obama administration is going to force their hand
[01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:39.100]  yes yes but what about what is the actual composition of support in the texas legislature
[01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:47.020]  for possibly being able to actually pass this i mean i know the the the austin area representatives
[01:37:47.020 --> 01:37:53.100]  we're going to get a bill through no no questions asked we're going to get a bill through in
[01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:58.460]  response to what the president has done the problem is there are some more moderate bills
[01:37:58.460 --> 01:38:04.300]  that have come forward um since you know since this whole thing since this media firestorm has
[01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:10.380]  is erupted over the issue yes there are some more moderate bills that have come forward that are
[01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:14.540]  that frankly are going to undermine what we're trying to do here when you say moderate for
[01:38:14.540 --> 01:38:19.900]  example your bill makes it a felony crime for a federal official to try to enforce an
[01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:25.500]  unconstitutional order in the state of texas are you saying that for example that felony is not
[01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:31.820]  present in a less powerful bill it's not it's not present in either bill it's it almost looks more
[01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:36.300]  like a suggestion or a house resolution than it does a bill you might as well just do a house
[01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:42.220]  resolution we hate what obama's you know we we need a bill that has real teeth in it we we need
[01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:47.980]  to draw a line in the sand and say enough we're done now when this was attempted drawing a line
[01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:53.820]  in the sand i think roughly a year ago with the tsa tsa bill that david simpson said that
[01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:58.540]  tsa bill that david simpson put through exactly exactly yeah you know the thing about that bill
[01:38:58.540 --> 01:39:06.300]  is that it started too late if it had started in january like this one is then then that bill
[01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:12.620]  would have had that bill would have had what what what our bill has right now which is it's got this
[01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:17.900]  broad base of support from people all over texas yeah i mean my phone is being rung off the hook
[01:39:17.900 --> 01:39:24.220]  right now we can't we can't get to all the calls as possible well i i'm sure that's the case if i
[01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:28.780]  was in a gun shop just the other day and uh i asked i asked the the owner did you hear about
[01:39:28.780 --> 01:39:32.380]  representative toath's bill and they said are you kidding me everybody that walks in our doors
[01:39:32.380 --> 01:39:39.740]  keeps telling us about it yeah i mean it's it's it's really cool and you know i i don't know if
[01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:47.900]  you've if i'm gonna get i'm gonna get on a faith-packed track here for a second but um this
[01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:52.940]  has been so encouraging and the lord has so encouraged us over and i'll tell you why kendall
[01:39:52.940 --> 01:39:57.660]  croaker is a really great guy he's the guy that that started this thing in wyoming i want to give
[01:39:57.660 --> 01:40:03.260]  him credit for it yes kendall kendall's the one that started this whole thing well it was really
[01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:09.740]  cool as our office got a call yesterday from kendall's sister and she said you know of all
[01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:14.700]  the states that kendall's sister could live in what do you think the chances are that his sister
[01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:21.180]  out of 50 states just happens to live in texas and out of 150 house districts across the state of
[01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:28.300]  texas what are the chances that i live in steve's district wow she lives in district 15 huh she
[01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:33.980]  lives in my district and she goes you know we just we're behind you when we're behind this legislation
[01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:40.780]  you guys are trying to do it the right way and um we want the people in the state of texas to get
[01:40:40.780 --> 01:40:46.300]  behind it because if if abraham lincoln said this he said if you don't have the people behind you
[01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:50.540]  can't do anything great i don't want to do it i don't want to do something moderate i want to
[01:40:50.540 --> 01:40:55.740]  do something great yeah if if you guys get fired up about it if you're willing to call your your
[01:40:55.740 --> 01:41:00.860]  representatives and your senators about it then we can get a strong bill through that that is
[01:41:00.860 --> 01:41:06.860]  a message and also because this is a national and even a global audience this matters to all of you
[01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:10.860]  who are listening right now no matter what state you live in in the united states or even what
[01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:17.020]  country you live in because if texas can set the precedent to standing up to unconstitutional
[01:41:17.020 --> 01:41:21.820]  executive orders from the executive branch of the federal government that sets a precedent that
[01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:26.860]  applies to all 50 states right mr toath yeah i mean think about this folks when you take your
[01:41:26.860 --> 01:41:31.500]  kid to the pediatrician do you want the pediatrician saying to little johnny hey does
[01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:37.420]  your mommy or daddy have a gun at home right i mean seriously i mean this is no different than
[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:42.380]  how things were in red china when they're turning kids against their parents this is no different
[01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:49.020]  than how things were in the early days of of of uh nazi germany or stasi secret police under
[01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:54.860]  muzalini or whatever yeah you're right it's it's the same kind of snitch society reporting people
[01:41:54.860 --> 01:42:00.140]  reporting honest citizens to the feds to be disarmed or even jailed this is and that's part
[01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:05.900]  of this you know here's how he did things when when he got obama care through it was this nebulous
[01:42:05.900 --> 01:42:12.620]  3700 page we don't know what's in it until until we pass it we can't read it until we pass it
[01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:19.740]  3700 pages of nebulous innocuous stuff oh don't worry about it it's fuzzy it's fluffy it's cuddly
[01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:25.340]  don't worry about it there are no sharp edges to it whatsoever it gets passed now it's 37 000 pages
[01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:29.980]  the only thing worse than a politician that's been in austin or washington too long
[01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:36.540]  is an unelected bureaucrat that's been there too long and they are the ones they're the dangerous
[01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:43.740]  ones that will put words that will put substance to these 23 actions that the president is handed
[01:42:43.740 --> 01:42:50.460]  out yeah that's right folks you better be worried about it let me ask your your opinion uh attorney
[01:42:50.460 --> 01:42:57.180]  general texas attorney general greg abbott put out an ad recently in new york and i love this
[01:42:57.180 --> 01:43:04.220]  and i love what mr abbott has done here and this was written up in reuters with the following title
[01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:10.780]  y'all come to texas state official tells new york gun owners it was a great ad by mr abbott or i i
[01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:15.740]  mean he he helped organize it to say that if you want to come to a state where you have more freedom
[01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:20.860]  and lower taxes and more liberties come to texas and bring your rifle and your ammunition i thought
[01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:26.380]  it was fantastic what are your thoughts on mr abbott's actions in regard to that publicity
[01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:30.940]  i mean i hit on that last night when i was on hannity and and i had a very close friend of mine
[01:43:30.940 --> 01:43:35.980]  that saw the interview and he said if you'll get my resume martyred nile packer backs tomorrow
[01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:41.420]  and and you know the reality here's the reality it's not just like as the governor told john
[01:43:42.380 --> 01:43:46.620]  you're not going to be 15 off better simply because there are no state income taxes
[01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:54.780]  our standard our cost of living is is is 30 lower yes so for those of you that aren't here yet
[01:43:54.780 --> 01:44:00.860]  i i grew up in upstate new york i moved here in 1997 because i believed in my heart of hearts
[01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:06.860]  this is the best place to raise my family and the people of texas have welcomed us and made a home
[01:44:06.860 --> 01:44:13.020]  for us yes and uh i'm just going to tell you the quality of the living will be twice as good and
[01:44:13.020 --> 01:44:17.740]  the cost of living will be a third of what you're paying anywhere else absolutely that's that's one
[01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:22.620]  of the reasons i'm here and plus i just just love the liberty and i love i am proud of being in
[01:44:22.620 --> 01:44:28.060]  texas and knowing that texas has people like you mr toath and people like mr abbott who i i hear
[01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:33.340]  has aims maybe for the governorship which maybe he'd be the perfect person to do that down the
[01:44:33.340 --> 01:44:39.180]  road when that opportunity arises but i am just proud to be in a state that says we we have
[01:44:39.180 --> 01:44:43.900]  liberty here and we're going to stand for it we are going to stand up against tyranny we're going
[01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:49.980]  to pass the laws that nullify unconstitutional orders we are texans and we're not laying down
[01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:56.140]  for a bunch of tyrants i love that attitude we've got i mean yeah but we need to hear from all of
[01:44:56.140 --> 01:45:01.900]  you i mean and let the phones ring right now call general abbott's office and let him know that
[01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:07.020]  you're going to get behind the firearms protection act yes let him hear it he needs to hear from you
[01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:15.740]  guys um they want to be about this isn't this isn't a lack of leadership this is they want to
[01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:21.020]  hear from the people they need the people to be heard they want to hear from you guys which one
[01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:25.660]  of these bills do you want something more more moderate they'll support something more moderate
[01:45:25.660 --> 01:45:32.220]  but if they hear from the grassroots of texas that they want to build with teeth in it then
[01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:37.100]  then tell the tell the attorney general's office that that you're going to stand behind the firearms
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:42.220]  protection act and you want him to as well respectfully because he's a good man exactly
[01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:47.740]  yeah and and that's the message all of you out there who are tired of being oppressed and having
[01:45:47.740 --> 01:45:53.020]  your rights eroded by executive orders or the federal government in whatever way and there's
[01:45:53.020 --> 01:45:57.260]  a lot of this happening in agriculture too with the the food safety modernization act that just
[01:45:57.260 --> 01:46:03.100]  hammers small farmers in texas as well i've even covered that the time can i share another one
[01:46:03.100 --> 01:46:08.540]  yeah sure go ahead please there is there is a terrible curriculum going through the schools
[01:46:08.540 --> 01:46:14.700]  today it's called cisco it is an 80 of the schools across the state of texas parents are not allowed
[01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:21.900]  to view it they're not allowed to go online to look at it's a portal online um curriculum parents
[01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:27.340]  are not allowed to look at it teachers are are forced to find non-disclosure agreements about
[01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:35.100]  what's in it really it's filled with islam um it is it is a it is it is the worst of the worst of
[01:46:35.100 --> 01:46:41.420]  the worst when where did this come from well it's it started with um here's the problem when you
[01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:45.580]  start a government agency you can't kill it so we have these education service centers in the state
[01:46:45.580 --> 01:46:51.420]  of texas that 20 30 years ago when we're in when we're in school and you wanted to film strip or
[01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:56.860]  you wanted a 16 millimeter movie you would go to the education service center where they they they
[01:46:56.860 --> 01:47:01.500]  were you know the balls basically for all the equipment and all these great films and slides
[01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:05.260]  and everything else but we don't need that anymore because we have this thing called the internet the
[01:47:05.260 --> 01:47:09.820]  streaming video and audio and all that cool stuff we get it over we get it over the internet yeah
[01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:16.540]  so like any good government agency it became a solution in search of a problem and so what they
[01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:21.020]  did was they came out with this thing called cisco they spent millions of dollars of taxpayers money
[01:47:21.020 --> 01:47:27.740]  on it and um it's it's not under the guise it's not under the supervision auspices of the state
[01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:32.940]  board of education these liberals that are running it can basically say and do anything that they
[01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:37.660]  want without the approval of the state board of education who are elected by we the people but
[01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:42.700]  you see that's their attack point now is to try to indoctrinate the next generation it is exactly
[01:47:42.700 --> 01:47:46.380]  what they're trying to do and with all these tv shows too that are coming out i don't know how
[01:47:46.380 --> 01:47:51.900]  much you're aware of those but this show about they hate paul revere and a show demonizing the
[01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:58.460]  founding fathers and most of these shows get this our founding the tea party the boston tea party
[01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:05.500]  they're referred to in c scope as terrorists oh man yeah not surprising well they're going for
[01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:10.540]  broke mr toad they're going for broke this is this is texas yeah yeah they're they're trying
[01:48:10.540 --> 01:48:14.780]  to turn any person who just believes in the constitution and the founding fathers into a
[01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:20.060]  total outright terrorist i mean that's right it's now in our faces there can no longer be any doubt
[01:48:20.060 --> 01:48:25.020]  they're not beating around the bush so to speak they're going for your freedoms just outright
[01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:32.300]  oh man unbelievable so unbelievable mr toad i let me ask you a question on different track

[01:54:18.220 --> 01:54:22.700]  interview with representative steve toath from the state of texas and the firearms protection act and
[01:54:22.700 --> 01:54:29.180]  i want to reiterate why this matters to everybody across the nation and wherever you may be listening
[01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:34.860]  from this is a precedent-setting bill and it's based on the bill out of wyoming and that really
[01:54:34.860 --> 01:54:39.980]  that the author of that bill deserves the credit but the language of this bill can be shared with
[01:54:39.980 --> 01:54:44.780]  many other states and there are lots of other states who would like to get on board and stand
[01:54:44.780 --> 01:54:49.580]  up to the federal government and say enough is enough we're not going to let our rights be
[01:54:49.580 --> 01:54:56.060]  trampled on any longer because look where this is going folks if you don't stand up to this
[01:54:57.580 --> 01:55:00.940]  second amendment is not the end of this they're going to come after your first amendment they're
[01:55:00.940 --> 01:55:04.940]  going to come after your fifth amendment even more than they have already they're going to
[01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:10.300]  obliterate states rights and basically say there shouldn't be any states whatsoever and with the
[01:55:10.300 --> 01:55:14.940]  executive orders obama is going to be saying well we don't need congress either what's the point of
[01:55:14.940 --> 01:55:22.540]  having congress when the president just writes law this is the basis of the downfall of our
[01:55:22.540 --> 01:55:28.140]  free society and it has already begun we are we have already started to tumble down that pit
[01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:34.140]  of tyranny and oppression and if we don't turn back from that right now it's over this is this
[01:55:34.140 --> 01:55:39.660]  is it so you better get on the phone right now if you're in the state of texas you better get on the
[01:55:39.660 --> 01:55:46.380]  phone call attorney general greg abbott's office and tell him yes you support the full the full-on
[01:55:46.380 --> 01:55:52.540]  firearms protection act that makes it a felony for federal officials to engage in unconstitutional
[01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:57.340]  gun restriction in the state of texas you better call your state representatives wherever you live
[01:55:57.340 --> 01:56:01.660]  and tell them introduce the firearms protection act because if you don't if you don't draw the
[01:56:01.660 --> 01:56:07.020]  line right here it's over and let me tell you my personal prediction of what i think is coming up
[01:56:07.020 --> 01:56:16.860]  so why why didn't obama have a high-capacity magazine restriction in his executive orders
[01:56:17.740 --> 01:56:22.700]  there was all this talk that he was going to do that but he backed off it seems he did not do that
[01:56:22.700 --> 01:56:27.500]  why because he has full confidence that they're going to be able to get that through congress
[01:56:27.500 --> 01:56:32.780]  through legislation so you have to ask the question then why does he have that confidence
[01:56:32.780 --> 01:56:42.700]  when right now the the mood the the environment in congress is saying no to more gun restrictions
[01:56:42.700 --> 01:56:49.340]  in congress why does he have that confidence the answer is because they are planning another major
[01:56:49.340 --> 01:56:57.900]  false flag attack in america a major false flag attack and i'm here to tell you independently
[01:56:57.900 --> 01:57:04.860]  independently at not even not even based on what alex said or infowars or anybody else but just
[01:57:04.860 --> 01:57:11.660]  myself as mike adams as an intelligent investigative journalist with no criminal record absolutely you
[01:57:11.660 --> 01:57:16.700]  know the cleanest cut guy you'll ever meet i don't smoke i don't drink alcohol i never have
[01:57:16.700 --> 01:57:21.820]  a consumed alcohol just my personal choice clean cut guy super clean record passed all the fbi
[01:57:21.820 --> 01:57:26.940]  background checks all the atf checks you know for class four gear you name it all right you're not
[01:57:26.940 --> 01:57:32.300]  going to find somebody with with a cleaner record than myself by looking at the data i am telling
[01:57:32.300 --> 01:57:39.340]  you i believe that they are going to stage another major false flag attack during the debate of gun
[01:57:39.340 --> 01:57:45.500]  control restrictions in the u.s congress because they know that if they stage something big enough
[01:57:45.500 --> 01:57:50.540]  and i'm talking about something like blowing up federal buildings more than what we saw in
[01:57:50.540 --> 01:57:57.900]  oklahoma city something even perhaps bigger than 911 i'm talking about perhaps them doing a a dirty
[01:57:57.900 --> 01:58:04.620]  bomb a radiological attack or a biological attack in a major u.s city and somehow finding some way
[01:58:04.620 --> 01:58:12.140]  to blame that on patriots that's what is coming so you better be ready because if they do that and
[01:58:12.140 --> 01:58:17.740]  if they can blame it on patriots and they get the media screaming again and again about how how the
[01:58:17.740 --> 01:58:22.540]  patriots made this happen and killed a million people in some major city they'll declare
[01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:27.180]  martial law there won't be another election you won't have any rights whatsoever and they'll drive
[01:58:27.180 --> 01:58:33.180]  america into an all-out war and that's what they want so watch out that's what's coming all right
[01:58:33.180 --> 01:58:38.060]  stay with me here on the alex jones show a lot more straight ahead including dr andrew wakefield

[02:00:21.500 --> 02:00:27.660]  welcome to the third hour of the alex jones show this is mike adams
[02:00:27.660 --> 02:00:33.820]  filling in for alex and i appreciate you joining us today we've got so much on our plates things
[02:00:33.820 --> 02:00:38.860]  are moving very very rapidly now coming up in the next segment we've got dr andrew wakefield
[02:00:38.860 --> 02:00:44.940]  joining us here live in studio here in austin texas to give us the latest information on the
[02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:52.140]  u.s vaccine court admitting that vaccines cause autism plus we're going to get dr wakefield's
[02:00:52.140 --> 02:00:59.260]  take on the new psychiatric police state that has just been formed in america by obama and his 23
[02:00:59.260 --> 02:01:04.300]  executive orders there was an outstanding breakdown of those executive orders posted
[02:01:04.300 --> 02:01:09.180]  filmed and posted by aaron dykes right here on the infowars team just i think yesterday or the
[02:01:09.180 --> 02:01:14.460]  night before that went up seven of the 23 executive orders have something to do with mental health
[02:01:14.460 --> 02:01:19.660]  so you can bet they're going to start using psychiatry as a weapon against freedom while
[02:01:19.660 --> 02:01:24.460]  completely ignoring the fact that psychiatry actually creates violent shooters and has been
[02:01:24.460 --> 02:01:30.140]  linked to most of these shootings that have taken place so wow what a what a total scam a total
[02:01:30.140 --> 02:01:36.220]  racket they're making the problem worse while ignoring the real causes of violence in america
[02:01:36.220 --> 02:01:43.260]  today two things i wanted to cover though real quick before we bring dr wakefield in studio one
[02:01:43.260 --> 02:01:48.060]  is that you know you've got obama and all these people talking about background checks that we
[02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:53.740]  need to have universal background checks why not have universal background checks for presidents
[02:01:54.460 --> 02:01:59.340]  because let me tell you this you know that obama's birth certificate has i don't know
[02:01:59.340 --> 02:02:06.380]  17 layers in adobe acrobat it's it's copied and pasted and the resolution is different in
[02:02:06.380 --> 02:02:11.020]  different parts of the document the thing is a total fake it's so obvious anybody who knows
[02:02:11.020 --> 02:02:18.460]  photoshop or acrobat can see that his birth certificate is a fake now if you or i submitted
[02:02:18.460 --> 02:02:23.740]  a document like that as part of a background check to purchase a gun we would be arrested
[02:02:23.740 --> 02:02:29.420]  for document fraud we would be guilty of a felony crime for submitting the same type of document
[02:02:29.420 --> 02:02:34.460]  which is an obvious fraud that the president of our country is using the claim that he's qualified
[02:02:34.460 --> 02:02:41.580]  to be president or that he that he uh meets the constitutional requirements so why not have
[02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:47.740]  universal background checks for presidents for his cabinet members why not have background checks
[02:02:47.740 --> 02:02:52.780]  for members of congress to make sure they can pass a quiz on the constitution you know what is
[02:02:52.780 --> 02:02:58.460]  what is the 10th amendment ask your average congressperson in washington dc and they won't
[02:02:58.460 --> 02:03:02.540]  know they don't know what it is or they'll misquote it they'll say oh the 10th amendment is
[02:03:02.540 --> 02:03:08.940]  what gives the government the right to regulate all intrastate commerce what what that's not
[02:03:08.940 --> 02:03:13.500]  what's written at all you people would fail you get an f okay you get an f on liberty and f on
[02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:18.620]  the constitution you get an f in washington on just about everything you're doing today except
[02:03:18.620 --> 02:03:24.220]  those few people that are standing up and a big thumbs up to rand paul by the way for his comments
[02:03:24.220 --> 02:03:30.700]  on saying that we don't want a king in america today it's we've had enough of kings running our
[02:03:30.700 --> 02:03:37.260]  lives so enough of the kingship one other comment here before we get into the next segment
[02:03:38.220 --> 02:03:44.060]  lance armstrong uh i i wrote an article about lance armstrong it's posted on infowars.com right

[02:04:16.060 --> 02:04:21.100]  those races and in the interview he didn't even think that it was cheating he just said oh it's
[02:04:21.100 --> 02:04:25.980]  just leveling the playing field i mean the guy has no remorse he bullied people he threatened
[02:04:25.980 --> 02:04:32.220]  people he filed lawsuits against a long list of whistleblowers who were trying to speak out and
[02:04:32.220 --> 02:04:38.220]  now he goes on oprah and wants us to forgive him dude we don't forgive you why don't you give the
[02:04:38.220 --> 02:04:43.340]  money back to all the people's people whose careers that you ruined or destroyed or threatened

[02:09:46.140 --> 02:09:52.860]  filling in for alex today and in studio joining me now for the rest of this hour is none other than
[02:09:52.860 --> 02:09:59.420]  dr andrew wakefield with some breaking news on the u.s vaccine court and its recent decision tying
[02:09:59.420 --> 02:10:04.860]  vaccines to autism without any question whatsoever so he'll be breaking that down for us in some
[02:10:04.860 --> 02:10:11.260]  detail also we're going to get dr wakefield's take on some of the possible implications of
[02:10:11.260 --> 02:10:16.780]  the recent executive orders focused on mental health and psychiatry and i've even got a copy
[02:10:16.780 --> 02:10:24.300]  of the psychiatry bible so to speak here with me and we're going to cover oppositional defiance
[02:10:24.300 --> 02:10:31.260]  disorder odd which is actually in the psychiatry manual even though people said i made that up
[02:10:31.260 --> 02:10:35.340]  i didn't make it up and i'm going to show it to you in the book as we continue here plus we're
[02:10:35.340 --> 02:10:40.780]  going to be taking your calls so if you've got a question for dr wakefield i'd like to take your
[02:10:40.780 --> 02:10:48.860]  call go ahead and call it's 888 isn't it no 800 i'm sorry 800-259-9231 if you've got a question
[02:10:48.860 --> 02:10:55.820]  on psychiatry or dr wakefield if you called earlier for paul watson's guest or representative
[02:10:55.820 --> 02:11:01.740]  toath i'm gonna have to drop you and and take new calls on psychiatry and questions for dr wakefield
[02:11:01.740 --> 02:11:06.060]  so go ahead and clear the board guys and let let new people call back in and i apologize if you're
[02:11:06.060 --> 02:11:11.260]  on hold but you know things are moving very quickly so dr wakefield welcome to the alex jones
[02:11:11.260 --> 02:11:15.900]  show it's good to have you in studio again it's great to be back thank you well a lot has been
[02:11:15.900 --> 02:11:22.780]  happening since the last time we spoke right here in the same spot you've got the the british medical
[02:11:22.780 --> 02:11:28.540]  journal still has not retracted their slanderous statements about you and your research is there
[02:11:28.540 --> 02:11:34.300]  any update on that front yes brian dear and the editor of the british medical journal and the bmj
[02:11:34.300 --> 02:11:38.940]  themselves are being sued here in the state of texas we're going through a jurisdictional battle
[02:11:38.940 --> 02:11:43.740]  at the moment they're saying you don't have the right to sue us here in texas this is a british
[02:11:43.740 --> 02:11:50.380]  journal these this is a british journalist but we do there's a long arm statute and they sell their
[02:11:50.380 --> 02:11:55.340]  wares and make a profit out of texas so um on the technical aspects of this we're confident in
[02:11:55.340 --> 02:12:00.940]  winning and getting brian dear here before a texas jury and that is the key really brian dear might
[02:12:00.940 --> 02:12:06.700]  be here in austin texas that is what this is all about i want the american people to see and judge
[02:12:06.700 --> 02:12:11.500]  this man for themselves and to judge the quality and the veracity of his story and they will see
[02:12:11.500 --> 02:12:17.100]  how flawed he really is or he could just remain a fugitive from justice i guess and refuse to come
[02:12:17.100 --> 02:12:21.980]  and and what you might have to go into extradition proceedings in the uk or how would that even work
[02:12:21.980 --> 02:12:25.020]  well it's interesting and it's probably a technical aspect of law but i would imagine
[02:12:25.020 --> 02:12:30.540]  that we would then file a case in england and he would then be in contempt of the uk courts but
[02:12:30.540 --> 02:12:35.180]  that's another matter the the bmj themselves have to come because they sell here this is
[02:12:35.180 --> 02:12:40.380]  one of their outlets so um they have they're obliged if we win the jurisdictional battle
[02:12:40.380 --> 02:12:46.060]  well excellent i appreciate your veracity your dedication to pursuing this and not allowing them
[02:12:46.060 --> 02:12:51.340]  to just steamroll you with their slanderous completely false analysis i mean they they
[02:12:51.340 --> 02:12:56.780]  literally just invented things about your research that they pulled out of thin air yeah i know what
[02:12:56.780 --> 02:13:01.180]  the problem here mike is so much bigger as you probably know there is a an increasing level of
[02:13:01.180 --> 02:13:07.180]  attack on scientists and physicians who are acting in the best interests of their patients and not in
[02:13:07.180 --> 02:13:11.820]  the best interests of the government or the pharmaceutical industry and there is a relentless
[02:13:11.820 --> 02:13:16.940]  assault on the few perhaps five ten scientists in the world who are prepared to work on the possible
[02:13:16.940 --> 02:13:23.020]  association between vaccines and childhood developmental disorders like autism and if we do
[02:13:23.020 --> 02:13:27.340]  not protect those scientists and doctors then you're going to find nobody who's prepared to
[02:13:27.340 --> 02:13:30.700]  stand up in vaccine court to protect these children because that's the end of their career
[02:13:30.700 --> 02:13:35.260]  you're going to find no scientist who's prepared to do the valid safety science on vaccines because
[02:13:35.260 --> 02:13:39.340]  it'll be the end of their career they lose their grants they'll lose everything just as i did and
[02:13:39.340 --> 02:13:45.420]  so we have got to stand up as a body as scientists as a community as a people and say these people
[02:13:45.420 --> 02:13:48.700]  are valuable and need to be protected and that is exactly what we're doing well said this is
[02:13:48.700 --> 02:13:54.700]  about the integrity of science i mean this is you know this is not a personal uh a revenge
[02:13:54.700 --> 02:13:59.100]  attack on brandy that's it's so much more important than that and the community actually
[02:13:59.100 --> 02:14:04.380]  said to me andy we need to fight this case we will raise the capital to help you because as you know
[02:14:04.380 --> 02:14:11.020]  mike justice belongs to those who can afford it yes so we need to take this battle to them in the
[02:14:11.020 --> 02:14:16.460]  u.s court well let's talk about the u.s vaccine court now also there's been significant breaking
[02:14:16.460 --> 02:14:22.540]  news that you brought to my attention an article published at huffpost vaccine court awards millions
[02:14:22.540 --> 02:14:29.580]  to two children with autism the court has made the determination that there is a causal link
[02:14:29.580 --> 02:14:34.460]  between vaccinations and the development of autism in those children and they were given an award
[02:14:34.460 --> 02:14:38.860]  give us a breakdown of that story well it's this is fascinating it's huge it's a game changer and
[02:14:38.860 --> 02:14:43.340]  it comes on the back of an italian decision in the remedy court which made an identical decision here
[02:14:43.340 --> 02:14:47.580]  we have a child who was developing perfectly normally in italy who had the mmr and regressed
[02:14:47.580 --> 02:14:51.580]  into autism he developed all the typical characteristics that we described originally
[02:14:51.580 --> 02:14:56.860]  in lancet including gastrointestinal symptoms encephalopathy in other words generalized brain
[02:14:56.860 --> 02:15:02.780]  dysfunction and his final diagnosis was autism they settled that case in italy the government
[02:15:02.780 --> 02:15:08.860]  importantly did not fight it they agreed that the mmr had caused his autism they thought it on the
[02:15:08.860 --> 02:15:16.060]  basis that they do not make mmr vaccination mandatory in in italy whereas the judge said no sorry you
[02:15:16.060 --> 02:15:20.540]  put so much pressure on parents to have this vaccine you are to blame now we have this ruling
[02:15:20.540 --> 02:15:25.740]  in the u.s vaccine court where you have exactly the same sequence of events normally developing
[02:15:25.740 --> 02:15:32.940]  children get the mmr plus another vaccine in each case of these two children they then regress into
[02:15:32.940 --> 02:15:38.860]  they have this encephalopathy a rash of fever loss of language loss of speech loss of interaction
[02:15:38.860 --> 02:15:44.940]  with their siblings and a regression into autism they are linked and what this brings to the public
[02:15:44.940 --> 02:15:51.180]  attention once and for all is that the american uh vaccine court the department of justice have
[02:15:51.180 --> 02:15:57.580]  been hiding behind the vaccine court for so long oh yeah take behind their table injuries now we
[02:15:57.580 --> 02:16:03.660]  have a clear sequence of events which links vaccines mmr in particular to autism all right
[02:16:03.660 --> 02:16:08.940]  if you're just joining us this is the alex jones show mike adams filling in an interview with dr
[02:16:08.940 --> 02:16:14.780]  andrew wakefield live here in studio in austin texas and a lot of breaking news on the vaccine
[02:16:14.780 --> 02:16:21.580]  front now we published a story not too long ago dr wakefield where the cdc admits on their website
[02:16:21.580 --> 02:16:26.700]  and we you know took a screenshot quoted their information they admit that vaccines contain
[02:16:27.420 --> 02:16:37.020]  mercury aluminum msg monosodium glutamate and formaldehyde now these four substances should any
[02:16:37.020 --> 02:16:44.220]  doctor in any circumstance ever inject a child with aluminum mercury msg or formaldehyde
[02:16:44.220 --> 02:16:47.580]  no it would be unthinkable if you took these substances on their own and gave them to someone
[02:16:47.580 --> 02:16:52.460]  you would be you would face criminal prosecution and yet right they're saying that this is safe no
[02:16:52.460 --> 02:16:56.620]  it isn't it's never been tested for safety we just got a a recent report from the institute of
[02:16:56.620 --> 02:17:01.500]  medicine saying that there is a parlous lack of information on vaccine safety science both in
[02:17:01.500 --> 02:17:05.980]  terms of the schedule of the dose that children get and when they get it we simply do not know
[02:17:05.980 --> 02:17:10.620]  there is no science and so if people are telling the public that vaccines are safe because they've
[02:17:10.620 --> 02:17:16.540]  been shown to be safe that is not true right right exactly but brings up the question why
[02:17:16.540 --> 02:17:24.780]  won't the cdc the fda and the the pro vaccine doctors out there why won't they say let's make
[02:17:24.780 --> 02:17:31.180]  a clean vaccine let's make clean vaccines with no mercury no thimerosal no msg no formaldehyde
[02:17:31.180 --> 02:17:36.460]  nothing like just single dose vials right so they don't need a preservative because they're
[02:17:36.460 --> 02:17:41.500]  not used for multiple doses why won't they do that there are two parts to this answer mike in
[02:17:41.500 --> 02:17:45.980]  my opinion and one of them is accountability if you make a change then it's a tacit admission
[02:17:45.980 --> 02:17:49.580]  that there was a problem with the vaccine that you had before so they'd rather keep harming
[02:17:49.580 --> 02:17:53.180]  children rather than fix the problem that seems to be the case and the other problem mike is that
[02:17:53.180 --> 02:17:58.060]  they don't want to lose the public to lose confidence the vaccine schedule the vaccine
[02:17:58.060 --> 02:18:02.540]  policy of any country depends upon the compliance of the populace in other words people having
[02:18:02.540 --> 02:18:08.380]  enough confidence in the vaccine regulators to say yes we'll take your your word for it and if
[02:18:08.380 --> 02:18:12.620]  that goes then it's it's to try to cross the board you know people will lose confidence in vaccines
[02:18:12.620 --> 02:18:17.980]  right across the board and we will have problems well they are they are losing confidence in
[02:18:17.980 --> 02:18:24.380]  vaccines no mike they've lost it they've lost 89 percent of american parents in a recent study from
[02:18:24.380 --> 02:18:29.260]  uh university of michigan said the vaccine safety science was their number one medical research
[02:18:29.260 --> 02:18:35.020]  priority 89 of parents wow so the majority of parents have major concerns they do not believe
[02:18:35.020 --> 02:18:39.020]  the cdc they do not believe what their pediatrician is telling them they're saying in their in their
[02:18:39.020 --> 02:18:43.740]  communities on their streets in their schools so many children who are being damaged by these
[02:18:43.740 --> 02:18:49.020]  vaccines with autism at the sort of spearhead of all this that they do not believe what they're
[02:18:49.020 --> 02:18:53.100]  being old and it's obvious that they damage children i mean i remember even donald trump
[02:18:53.100 --> 02:18:58.140]  said on the air a couple of months ago that his employees perfectly healthy children took them
[02:18:58.140 --> 02:19:04.460]  into the pediatrician they got vaccinated the next morning lights are out the child's autistic
[02:19:04.460 --> 02:19:11.260]  and it happens to people over and over and over again there is a temporal correlation between
[02:19:11.260 --> 02:19:16.300]  getting the vaccine and getting autism how can the scientific community even call itself scientific
[02:19:16.300 --> 02:19:22.860]  if it dismisses all of this powerful evidence it is extraordinary to me clinically it is so obvious
[02:19:22.860 --> 02:19:27.980]  my job as a physician and a scientist is to look for patterns in disease patterns in clinical
[02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:33.900]  presentation and the pattern here is so common so similar and it's exactly as you heard in these
[02:19:33.900 --> 02:19:40.700]  court settlements normal child vaccine prolonged fever rash debilitation the child goes downhill
[02:19:40.700 --> 02:19:44.380]  their immune system goes to pieces all right hold on never the same again hold that thought

[02:24:21.980 --> 02:24:29.020]  we are continuing our interview here in studio with dr andrew wakefield yes the dr wakefield
[02:24:29.020 --> 02:24:34.300]  the champion of academic integrity when it comes to on scientific integrity actually more importantly
[02:24:34.300 --> 02:24:39.100]  when it comes to vaccines and investigating with a sense of scientific skepticism
[02:24:39.740 --> 02:24:45.100]  what could be the links between vaccines and childhood development disorders such as autism
[02:24:45.100 --> 02:24:50.220]  but not limited to autism and dr wakefield continues with us in the studio right now dr
[02:24:50.220 --> 02:24:56.620]  wakefield what kinds of i i want to get the word out about how people can help support your efforts
[02:24:56.620 --> 02:25:00.460]  because this is an important victory and you mentioned a website during the break can you
[02:25:00.460 --> 02:25:04.860]  give that out on the air certainly in order to protect doctors and scientists who are acting in
[02:25:04.860 --> 02:25:10.460]  the interests of their patients but who are being attacked by what is whatever mainstream medicine
[02:25:10.460 --> 02:25:15.740]  is by the pharmaceutical industry by the media because they are not complying with the rules
[02:25:16.460 --> 02:25:20.940]  that protect the stock price of of various pharmaceutical products then what we've done
[02:25:20.940 --> 02:25:26.940]  is to set up what we call the academic integrity fund academic integrity fund.org and this
[02:25:26.940 --> 02:25:31.740]  is a fund that people can pay into which will protect the legal rights will allow the
[02:25:31.740 --> 02:25:35.980]  people who are coming under attack to fight back whether it's in the courts or elsewhere
[02:25:35.980 --> 02:25:39.820]  and it's starting with my case right here in texas in an attempt to get brian deere and the
[02:25:39.820 --> 02:25:45.820]  british medical journal in front of a texas jury and are there are i know it takes money to fight
[02:25:45.820 --> 02:25:51.660]  for justice big time is are there some attorneys also doing some pro bono work as part of it or
[02:25:51.660 --> 02:25:56.620]  discounted work i have an outstanding group of attorneys who are working at a discounted rate
[02:25:57.340 --> 02:26:01.660]  because they believe very strongly in the merits of this case well i'm going to make a donation
[02:26:01.660 --> 02:26:06.380]  by the way i've been doing a lot of donations lately i donated to gun owners of america
[02:26:06.380 --> 02:26:11.580]  i gave 500 to that group i just larry pratt you rock i gave him 500 bucks i'm going to donate to
[02:26:11.580 --> 02:26:17.180]  your group academic integrity fund.org is the web address we've got to put the money where it
[02:26:17.180 --> 02:26:23.100]  matters i call that uh revenue activism so we take money from our store sales and we just push it
[02:26:23.100 --> 02:26:27.420]  into all these things that need support but uh thank you for mentioning that website but
[02:26:27.420 --> 02:26:33.580]  continuing on what do you think about this flu so-called flu pandemic almost a fear-mongering
[02:26:33.580 --> 02:26:38.460]  thing the cdc is doing right now saying oh the flu is terrible everybody should go get vaccinated
[02:26:38.460 --> 02:26:43.500]  isn't that a too simplistic of an answer we've seen this time and time again mike and i'm not
[02:26:43.500 --> 02:26:48.860]  an expert on flu vaccine but i do know that for example flu mutates at a phenomenally fast rate
[02:26:48.860 --> 02:26:53.100]  so predicting which vaccine is going to work against the current flu is such a hit and miss
[02:26:53.100 --> 02:26:59.020]  affair and we've seen from analyses detailed comprehensive scientific analyses of all the data
[02:26:59.020 --> 02:27:03.980]  on flu vaccine around the world in the cochran review that these vaccines are their their
[02:27:03.980 --> 02:27:09.020]  benefit is minimal at best and restricted to certain groups not seen in high-risk groups
[02:27:09.020 --> 02:27:13.420]  and therefore there is no merit in those high-risk groups getting them and the canadians showing
[02:27:13.420 --> 02:27:18.380]  that if you get the flu after being vaccinated because it does not work well then it is worse
[02:27:18.380 --> 02:27:24.780]  you develop a more severe pattern of disease but you have been vaccinated the cdc which i am
[02:27:24.780 --> 02:27:30.700]  convinced just invents numbers out of thin air i mean they just pull these out of their hats and
[02:27:30.700 --> 02:27:35.340]  they they say if you get the vaccine your flu will be less severe but they have absolutely
[02:27:35.340 --> 02:27:40.940]  no data to back that up and they say the vaccine is now i think they're quoting it's 62 effective
[02:27:40.940 --> 02:27:45.500]  that number has no basis in anything they make it up i'm sure they do and they have the ability to
[02:27:45.500 --> 02:27:52.140]  make a sows ear out of a silk purse i think that's what they've done here they've made numbers up
[02:27:52.140 --> 02:27:55.980]  for so long what are we to believe and when you hear these numbers about the people who've
[02:27:55.980 --> 02:28:00.140]  had to go to the hospital because they've got flu how many of those people were vaccinated
[02:28:00.140 --> 02:28:04.380]  were they part of those group that group that the canadians say exactly are going to be worse if they
[02:28:04.380 --> 02:28:08.460]  get the flu after having been vaccinated we don't know we're not told i did a little bit of a survey
[02:28:08.460 --> 02:28:14.140]  on that and i found that about two-thirds in my group of you know friends and employees and so on
[02:28:14.140 --> 02:28:20.220]  about two-thirds of the people who went to the hospital with influenza i'm not talking about my
[02:28:20.220 --> 02:28:24.380]  employees they're they're typically healthy but people they know you know two-thirds of them have
[02:28:24.380 --> 02:28:30.940]  been vaccinated against the flu so how can that be if the flu works i mean if the flu vaccine
[02:28:30.940 --> 02:28:35.100]  works then how can two-thirds of the people in the hospital with the flu be people who got
[02:28:35.100 --> 02:28:41.500]  vaccinated it's not logical yeah there's something very bad going wrong here and the idea that you're
[02:28:41.500 --> 02:28:46.780]  going to give mercury containing flu vaccines to pregnant women and to children over the age of
[02:28:46.780 --> 02:28:53.980]  six months this is unacceptable tell me about when you were trained in med school weren't you taught
[02:28:53.980 --> 02:28:58.300]  never give a vaccine to a pregnant woman absolutely i mean it was you never gave anything
[02:28:58.300 --> 02:29:02.300]  to a pregnant woman unless absolutely necessary you know you've no antidepressants absolutely
[02:29:02.300 --> 02:29:06.380]  you've got a very very vulnerable fetus there a lot of these compounds are sequestered they're
[02:29:06.380 --> 02:29:10.540]  taken up preferentially into the fetus the fetus does not have the ability to get rid of them for
[02:29:10.540 --> 02:29:15.260]  example mercury if you give a mother mercury that mercury is going to be uh is going to get into the
[02:29:15.260 --> 02:29:19.340]  fetus and it cannot it doesn't have the excretion mechanisms to get rid of it so it's going to
[02:29:19.340 --> 02:29:24.780]  accumulate but the cdc and the vaccine pushers they engage in what i might call magical thinking
[02:29:24.780 --> 02:29:29.020]  where they say the mercury doesn't harm you because we say it doesn't we wave a magic wand
[02:29:29.020 --> 02:29:34.460]  we do a little voodoo big pharma profit voodoo and suddenly the mercury is safe magical so they've
[02:29:34.460 --> 02:29:39.340]  said the science shows that the science is in two years ago the paper came out showing that 74 of
[02:29:39.340 --> 02:29:43.660]  the published science shows that there is an association between heavy metal containing
[02:29:43.660 --> 02:29:47.100]  vaccines and autism all right well said dr wakefield we'll be right back here on the
[02:29:47.100 --> 02:29:53.020]  alex jones show and your calls straight ahead we're on the march the empire's on the run

[02:33:53.180 --> 02:33:59.740]  well thank you you know there was a small uh health uh natural health company here that was
[02:33:59.740 --> 02:34:06.300]  exposing all this information on a daily basis and the ftcs went after them it was called daniel
[02:34:06.300 --> 02:34:11.580]  chapter one and basically if yeah they attacked their first amendment rights and and if they were
[02:34:11.580 --> 02:34:15.980]  to say anything about this anymore they're basically going to put them in prison so they're
[02:34:15.980 --> 02:34:20.300]  they ended their radio program you know we need the support of the people that's the problem
[02:34:21.020 --> 02:34:25.580]  is they're attacked they're killing the messenger you know they're going after the messenger
[02:34:25.580 --> 02:34:29.820]  and they're doing it i mean the federal trade commission is who went after them not the well
[02:34:29.820 --> 02:34:34.460]  not the not the cdc yeah no i'm very familiar with that case that's a good point uh daniel
[02:34:34.460 --> 02:34:41.580]  chapter one was actually a ministry and they sold some cancer therapies herbal and they dared to go
[02:34:41.580 --> 02:34:46.300]  on the air and to say that you know some of these herbs are mentioned in the bible and they you know
[02:34:46.300 --> 02:34:50.860]  they they can actually help you heal from cancer and yeah the ftc came after them what do you see
[02:34:50.860 --> 02:34:55.100]  happening dr wakefield and thank you caller for your call but what do you see happening with
[02:34:55.100 --> 02:35:02.460]  attacks on the first amendment rights of people who are attempting to to raise awareness among the
[02:35:02.460 --> 02:35:09.340]  public of alternative or holistic healing therapies there are myriad cases of of local
[02:35:09.340 --> 02:35:15.340]  health authorities local regulators going after alternative practitioners i mean these attacks
[02:35:15.340 --> 02:35:20.140]  are going on all the time in fact texas is probably one of the worst states in the country
[02:35:20.140 --> 02:35:25.260]  for that the state medical board absolutely yeah and dr brazinski absolutely a classic example
[02:35:26.140 --> 02:35:31.580]  where i gather that they've now tried uh the fda are trying to get the patent on his products you
[02:35:31.580 --> 02:35:35.580]  know having attacked him for years now that's what i've heard through the grapevine yeah whether it's
[02:35:35.580 --> 02:35:39.820]  true or not it would be a wonderful irony to conclude that story as long as he comes out of it
[02:35:39.820 --> 02:35:48.460]  um well well but um one of the greatest uh groups guilty of of bio biopiracy is big pharma they will
[02:35:48.460 --> 02:35:54.220]  attack an herb and say it's useless it's useless it's useless and then they will steal a molecule
[02:35:54.220 --> 02:35:59.900]  from that herb like turmeric for example they'll modify it patented and then say this is the best
[02:35:59.900 --> 02:36:04.300]  drug ever oh yeah they're in the jungles now collecting a number of plants and herbs that
[02:36:04.860 --> 02:36:08.460]  they believe may be the future to their success because they run out of other things apart from
[02:36:08.460 --> 02:36:15.180]  vaccines to profit from um but uh the biggest impact i see is in the media you know here we
[02:36:15.180 --> 02:36:20.140]  have a case where a classic case a groundbreaking case two cases where uh the the vaccine cord
[02:36:20.140 --> 02:36:25.740]  awards uh for children who develop autism following mmr vaccine it's picked up by the uk
[02:36:25.740 --> 02:36:30.700]  media it's reported they're not a single word in the mainstream media here why because their
[02:36:30.700 --> 02:36:37.020]  revenues derived from advertising dollars from the pharmaceutical industry and that was a 1997
[02:36:37.020 --> 02:36:42.220]  decision i believe from the fda that legalized pharmaceutical advertising on mainstream television
[02:36:42.220 --> 02:36:46.780]  because before that it was illegal and it remains illegal in most every other nation around the
[02:36:46.780 --> 02:36:50.700]  world and what they did mike is i think quite a smart thing is that they they paid a lot of money
[02:36:50.700 --> 02:36:55.500]  and so that the the the media became dependent on that income you know it's like you kind of
[02:36:55.500 --> 02:36:59.820]  ramp things up according to the income that you get and yeah you can't do without it and so
[02:36:59.820 --> 02:37:04.300]  suddenly they've got them right where they want them got them got them yeah well we'll just leave
[02:37:04.300 --> 02:37:09.020]  it at that all right let's go to the next call rob in texas you're on the air rob go ahead what's
[02:37:09.020 --> 02:37:14.140]  your question sir well good afternoon gentlemen uh my statement actually speaks to psychiatric
[02:37:14.140 --> 02:37:20.620]  psychiatric tyranny that i see and to vaccines um my son who is on the spectrum with asperger's was
[02:37:20.620 --> 02:37:26.380]  vaccinated um he has depression and sometimes anger issues we take him to see a counselor we
[02:37:26.380 --> 02:37:32.860]  were going to take him to see a child psychiatrist and so my wife was getting that set up he asked
[02:37:32.860 --> 02:37:38.300]  sir you know do you have insurance she naively says well yes what kind okay we accept that she
[02:37:38.300 --> 02:37:43.420]  goes but we want to pay for this out of pocket he says no you can't do that if we accept your
[02:37:43.420 --> 02:37:50.300]  insurance they have to pay or it's insurance fraud this is new you can't pay cash no they
[02:37:50.300 --> 02:37:55.820]  wouldn't let us pay cash needless to say we didn't book an appointment yeah well well good question
[02:37:55.820 --> 02:38:02.540]  rob go ahead there's a big issue several big issues here actually one is um are the origins of
[02:38:02.540 --> 02:38:08.860]  your child's anger and violence or aggressive issues due to um underlying pain or discomfort
[02:38:08.860 --> 02:38:13.020]  one thing we've discovered in fact we reported years and years ago 15 years ago is these children
[02:38:13.020 --> 02:38:18.060]  have an inflammatory bowel disease in many cases and that is a cause of gastrointestinal symptoms
[02:38:18.060 --> 02:38:23.500]  constipation diarrhea alternating constipation and diarrhea pain kids in pain sudden outbursts of
[02:38:23.500 --> 02:38:27.340]  anger and when you correct that abdominal inflammation that intestinal inflammation
[02:38:27.340 --> 02:38:33.420]  all that goes away in other words is there a need for a reappraisal of children for medical
[02:38:33.420 --> 02:38:37.500]  problems underlying medical problems do they not need to be on pharmaceutical agents for
[02:38:37.500 --> 02:38:43.580]  uh for anger and depression at all and that's my belief very good source of problems yeah if
[02:38:43.580 --> 02:38:50.380]  someone has chronic ongoing pain in digestive pain or even musculoskeletal pain whatever the
[02:38:50.380 --> 02:38:55.020]  case may be you know they're going to be kind of crabby or maybe depressed in a bad mood that's
[02:38:55.020 --> 02:39:00.060]  not a psychiatric problem that's a physiological problem it's absolutely essential to rule out
[02:39:00.060 --> 02:39:05.580]  physiological medical problems before you resort to the belief that this is a psychiatric problem
[02:39:05.580 --> 02:39:10.540]  and then put them on major medications which have may have any number of adverse effects and for
[02:39:10.540 --> 02:39:16.060]  what we are not indicated for autism or asperger's disorders in these children so there may be an
[02:39:16.060 --> 02:39:21.260]  alternative approach mike is it mike yeah no sorry no the man on the phone rob rob i thought
[02:39:21.260 --> 02:39:24.620]  you're asking me my name yeah i'm mike what are you what you forgot me already what's going on
[02:39:26.220 --> 02:39:30.860]  so rob if there are you know if there are any underlying symptoms that might be corrected please
[02:39:30.860 --> 02:39:35.820]  bear that in mind and get take that approach first all right very good very good question rob thank
[02:39:35.820 --> 02:39:41.180]  you for your call and by the way here over overhead cam shot this is the dsm right here
[02:39:41.180 --> 02:39:47.340]  dsm for the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders the so-called bible of modern
[02:39:47.340 --> 02:39:55.660]  psychiatry and check it out here it is page 100 oppositional defiant disorder oppositional defiant
[02:39:55.660 --> 02:40:01.500]  disorder right here there we get in view check this out dr wakefield you can be diagnosed with
[02:40:01.500 --> 02:40:08.380]  this and i imagine you and i have both been quote diagnosed with this by simply disagreeing with
[02:40:08.380 --> 02:40:13.580]  someone in a position of authority it's just written right in here oh and they're probably
[02:40:13.580 --> 02:40:19.900]  drugs that they can oh look often argues with adults something that's in the first amendment
[02:40:19.900 --> 02:40:24.620]  i think that um often blames others for his or her mistakes well we don't do that but
[02:40:24.620 --> 02:40:29.820]  uh easily annoyed by others i'm annoyed by liberals who are trying to take away our rights
[02:40:29.820 --> 02:40:35.660]  i'm easily annoyed by gun grabbers uh i don't know i don't know who you're annoyed by uh journal
[02:40:35.660 --> 02:40:41.180]  journal editors who slander how long have we got yeah well anyway there it is it's real folks uh
[02:40:41.180 --> 02:40:45.740]  people said i made this up no it's right there and there are a couple of people it's right here
[02:40:45.740 --> 02:40:50.380]  from it right in this room but i exactly i think that manual is it's it underlies everything that's
[02:40:50.380 --> 02:40:55.180]  wrong with this disorder particularly autistic autistic spectrum disorders the worst thing
[02:40:55.180 --> 02:40:59.020]  is that it ever firmed at the hands of child psychiatrists i'm afraid that's my opinion and
[02:40:59.020 --> 02:41:03.980]  it's one i strongly strongly believe and what we see is a revision of this document time and time
[02:41:03.980 --> 02:41:08.540]  again dsm when they should be focusing on the real issue what is driving this epidemic of autism for
[02:41:08.540 --> 02:41:13.100]  a child born today the risk of an autistic spectrum disorder is going to be one in 25
[02:41:13.100 --> 02:41:17.420]  that is unacceptable and when what you find is the psychiatric psychology community spend their time
[02:41:17.420 --> 02:41:22.380]  revising this document not everyone yeah but a lot of people focus on this and it's a displacement
[02:41:22.380 --> 02:41:27.420]  activity it's moving away from what is really essential about this how do you stop this epidemic
[02:41:27.420 --> 02:41:30.620]  and how do you treat kids effectively you've already got it you know what this reminds me of
[02:41:30.620 --> 02:41:34.540]  i mean look at this manual this thing is huge i mean check this out that's how big it is it's a
[02:41:34.540 --> 02:41:39.180]  massive thick manual and it's getting bigger in version five all they do is they they they observe
[02:41:39.180 --> 02:41:42.700]  a lot of nutritional deficiencies a lot of underlying problems and they give it a bunch of
[02:41:42.700 --> 02:41:48.060]  different names this is like physicists looking for the god particle and naming all the little
[02:41:48.060 --> 02:41:51.820]  things they spot in the super collider saying oh that's the muon that's the gluon that's the
[02:41:51.820 --> 02:41:56.940]  blue on whatever they name it it's like no people it's there's there's one unified theory underneath
[02:41:56.940 --> 02:42:02.540]  all this you're just naming things to try to make it sound scientific there's really only
[02:42:02.540 --> 02:42:08.700]  a couple of basic core fundamental physiological truths or physical truths underneath all this
[02:42:08.700 --> 02:42:12.940]  yeah one of the great truths mike is you go back and you talk to the mother what happened to your
[02:42:12.940 --> 02:42:17.020]  child and mothers have got a trust in their instincts because their instincts are the reason
[02:42:17.020 --> 02:42:21.580]  we're on this earth at the moment not the dsm manual so that can go in the trash all right let's
[02:42:21.580 --> 02:42:27.020]  let's trash it there it goes off to the mother off and say what happened to your child very good
[02:42:27.020 --> 02:42:31.420]  let's take another call i'm getting i'm getting excited here because i'm suffering from oppositional
[02:42:31.420 --> 02:42:36.780]  defiant disorder jesse from new orleans you are on the air with dr andrew wakefield jesse welcome
[02:42:36.780 --> 02:42:43.740]  to the show mike how you doing i'm doing great man so right in line with your conversation about
[02:42:43.740 --> 02:42:50.940]  the dsm i was a victim of doctor uh doctors who basically use that book as their bible when i was
[02:42:50.940 --> 02:42:58.940]  a kid i uh my my parents made me go see a therapist and uh i basically started making things up
[02:42:59.980 --> 02:43:04.860]  based on what i was reading you know his diagnosis for certain things i actually read
[02:43:04.860 --> 02:43:11.340]  a book about michael crayton's terminal man and uh basically just started telling him i was having
[02:43:11.340 --> 02:43:15.820]  all the symptoms that the main character in that book had really and they completely took my word
[02:43:15.820 --> 02:43:23.820]  for it so what were you diagnosed with psychiatrist who then gave me some medication and then they
[02:43:23.820 --> 02:43:28.380]  inevitably i started telling him i was hearing voices even though i wasn't and because you know
[02:43:28.380 --> 02:43:36.300]  i was 13 so they admitted me and by the time it was all said and done i was on well butrin when
[02:43:36.300 --> 02:43:42.860]  it first came out depa coke now veins and they would give me thorazine whenever i acted up
[02:43:43.580 --> 02:43:48.700]  so and also probably those records could then be used against you now to deny you access to
[02:43:48.700 --> 02:43:53.500]  purchasing a firearm also i was a minor and interestingly enough i was still allowed to
[02:43:53.500 --> 02:44:01.660]  join the military at 17 so you figure that out but um beyond that uh my my kids i have two twin
[02:44:01.660 --> 02:44:07.260]  boys that were born eight months ago yeah seven months seven weeks premature and of course they
[02:44:07.260 --> 02:44:11.980]  were the whole time my wife was pregnant you know you need to double up on your flu vaccine you need
[02:44:11.980 --> 02:44:15.660]  to do all this and that and the other thing and i was like no we're not doing that so were you able
[02:44:15.660 --> 02:44:21.340]  to keep her protected from vaccines during pregnancy well i've exposed her to a lot of
[02:44:21.340 --> 02:44:26.700]  your research and and you know alex's research and all that stuff and i've shown her the numbers and
[02:44:26.700 --> 02:44:31.500]  one of the greatest things after the kids were born i was able to you know read up on a lot of
[02:44:31.500 --> 02:44:35.500]  different things and i showed the doctors because you know you can never get a doctor when you need
[02:44:35.500 --> 02:44:39.500]  one but you know you tell them you don't want the kids to have the vaccines you'll see everybody in
[02:44:39.500 --> 02:44:46.700]  the whole hospital and uh they started showing us all the documentation and i was like well you
[02:44:46.700 --> 02:44:52.540]  know i'm reading here that there's a fund that the government has for families who have adverse side
[02:44:52.540 --> 02:44:58.540]  effects from vaccinations how many incidents do you think have to happen before the federal
[02:44:58.540 --> 02:45:01.820]  government puts a fund together like that all right good question jesse thank you for your
[02:45:01.820 --> 02:45:08.220]  call dr wakefield let's talk about the pressure that physicians and even physicians assistants
[02:45:08.220 --> 02:45:16.220]  and so on put on new moms to to be injected even before childbirth during childbirth and after
[02:45:16.220 --> 02:45:21.980]  childbirth even the medicalization of childbirth in our country today what's around the world all
[02:45:21.980 --> 02:45:27.500]  of western medicine well mike any pressure any pressure at all in the absence of informed consent
[02:45:28.220 --> 02:45:34.620]  and adequate safety studies is too much there is huge pressure and there are no safety studies
[02:45:34.620 --> 02:45:37.740]  particularly of giving the vaccines to mothers during pregnancy where it's been
[02:45:38.540 --> 02:45:44.540]  specifically contraindicated in the past yeah causes stillbirth or causes spontaneous abortions
[02:45:44.540 --> 02:45:50.540]  yeah and there is no informed consent a friend of mine went to uh for a vaccine in fact uh to go
[02:45:50.540 --> 02:45:55.420]  into nursing school the other day and she was given two mmrs just a month apart there's never
[02:45:55.420 --> 02:46:00.060]  ever ever ever been a safety study of that procedure when asked why should i have a second
[02:46:00.060 --> 02:46:07.180]  mmr after the first one just a month ago and she said well the mumps vaccine doesn't work therefore
[02:46:07.180 --> 02:46:11.660]  you need another one booster and well then why do i have to have measles and rubella at the same time
[02:46:11.660 --> 02:46:15.260]  you can see this cash cow for the pharmaceutical industry right just because that's all they've
[02:46:15.260 --> 02:46:18.860]  got because that's all they're prepared to manufacture well and also what about vet
[02:46:18.860 --> 02:46:24.380]  veterinary medicine because if if the theory behind vaccines is that you inject your dog
[02:46:24.380 --> 02:46:30.300]  with a vaccine and the dog's body builds antibodies to that vaccine why do you get a card or an email
[02:46:30.300 --> 02:46:36.140]  from your vet every year oh your dog needs the same vaccine again every year i thought the
[02:46:36.140 --> 02:46:41.660]  i thought the theory was that the antibodies are there they don't go go away at least not i mean
[02:46:41.660 --> 02:46:47.260]  they're not supposed to it's supposed to build a database your immune system database right yeah
[02:46:47.260 --> 02:46:51.500]  you could argue that your immune system database needs boosting every every so often but there's
[02:46:51.500 --> 02:46:56.540]  no science on this so when they introduced mmr in the uk the minister who was responsible said
[02:46:56.540 --> 02:47:02.060]  this is one dose for life okay so people believe them and so people did it what happened is they
[02:47:02.060 --> 02:47:07.100]  found it didn't work neither the measles no the river the mumps vaccine uh lasted for very long
[02:47:07.100 --> 02:47:11.740]  so now it's two doses three doses soon we're going to be on this treadmill of having to have these
[02:47:11.740 --> 02:47:16.140]  vaccines every year because they do not work in other words here's the irony particularly for
[02:47:16.140 --> 02:47:21.260]  mumps vaccine the vaccine is successful for the pharmaceutical industry precisely because it
[02:47:21.260 --> 02:47:25.980]  doesn't work and then exactly volume of sales goes up dramatically that's exactly it because
[02:47:25.980 --> 02:47:30.620]  by when people go get the mumps vaccine they have a false sense of security thinking they're
[02:47:30.620 --> 02:47:34.940]  protected from the mumps and they might thereby not take other precautions such as boosting
[02:47:34.940 --> 02:47:40.300]  vitamin d intake which is very powerful for preventing mumps and many other infectious
[02:47:40.300 --> 02:47:46.140]  diseases so you're right the vaccines not working is what makes themselves so well and it allows the
[02:47:46.140 --> 02:47:51.900]  cdc to put out another fear-mongering announcement oh there's another epidemic of mumps better go get
[02:47:51.900 --> 02:47:55.820]  vaccinated even though it doesn't work that's right we're seeing mumps outbreaks in highly
[02:47:55.820 --> 02:48:00.220]  vaccinated populations now precisely because it doesn't work and it was a vaccine that was
[02:48:00.220 --> 02:48:04.940]  never needed in the first place not my word the cdc's word and the department of health in england
[02:48:04.940 --> 02:48:09.660]  why doesn't the media i mean i guess we already know the answer but it's just it's a shame the
[02:48:09.660 --> 02:48:15.740]  media never ever reports that in every outbreak they cover most of those who suffer from the
[02:48:15.740 --> 02:48:20.060]  outbreak whether it's mumps or flu or something else have already been vaccinated against that
[02:48:20.060 --> 02:48:26.380]  very thing they never report that yes the uh reporting in the media of the vaccine issue is
[02:48:26.380 --> 02:48:35.020]  so one-sided so distorted so pro uh the cdc prove the pharmaceutical industry pro uh more and more
[02:48:35.020 --> 02:48:39.100]  vaccines we're not going to get the truth from the mainstream media i'm afraid and that's going
[02:48:39.100 --> 02:48:44.300]  to last for some time yeah we're not going to get it from truth from them on any front let's go to
[02:48:44.300 --> 02:48:50.620]  another caller nick in pennsylvania nick welcome to the show you're on the air go ahead sir mike
[02:48:50.620 --> 02:48:56.540]  first of all i want to say i think that you're doing a great job for filling in for alex thanks
[02:48:56.540 --> 02:49:00.460]  and uh and you're you're doing a heck of a good job i'm just doing my best here man we're all
[02:49:00.460 --> 02:49:06.060]  we're all fighting for the same liberties that's all that's all there is to it absolutely and dr
[02:49:06.060 --> 02:49:12.940]  wakefield i just want to say it's really a pleasure sir to be talking to you i myself
[02:49:12.940 --> 02:49:19.260]  actually i'm one of america's few remaining pioneer research scientists and it's such a
[02:49:19.260 --> 02:49:25.020]  good coincidence that you happen to be on because there is a couple subjects that i'd like to talk
[02:49:25.020 --> 02:49:32.220]  to you about of a very important concern yeah go ahead let's hear it okay one of the subjects is
[02:49:32.780 --> 02:49:41.020]  i definitely agree with the vaccine problem especially being given to children infants babies
[02:49:41.020 --> 02:49:45.980]  there's definitely a problem with mercury and heavy metals and i think that they're absolutely
[02:49:45.980 --> 02:49:56.300]  positively is a link to autism because of that mercury that's why as far as tuna fish is concerned
[02:49:56.300 --> 02:50:01.580]  that has finally been brought to light that you have to be careful with certain fish you eat
[02:50:01.580 --> 02:50:09.580]  because of the mercury levels that are high in certain types of fish but another problem
[02:50:09.580 --> 02:50:16.060]  is also the fact that and it figures that there happens to be a phone ringing in the background
[02:50:16.060 --> 02:50:19.660]  as i my call comes no go ahead we're getting close to break go ahead with your question
[02:50:20.540 --> 02:50:27.660]  i apologize but but the other thing that i wanted to bring up you know what let me unplug this other
[02:50:27.660 --> 02:50:32.380]  phone well let me just ask dr wakefield to comment on that so the fda at one point did say you
[02:50:32.380 --> 02:50:36.940]  shouldn't eat too much tuna fish because of mercury but they even backed off of that so it's
[02:50:36.940 --> 02:50:42.620]  so it's suddenly like mercury is the the favorite element of the scientific medical corrupt
[02:50:42.620 --> 02:50:46.540]  community what's what's up with that i'm told by the experts that mercury is second only to
[02:50:46.540 --> 02:50:53.820]  plutonium on this planet as a as a toxin so um it's not safe in any form uh or in any dose there
[02:50:53.820 --> 02:50:59.500]  are no safe levels no safe forms the idea that one's better than the other um we'll be right back

[02:54:12.460 --> 02:54:18.780]  and by the way don't miss the alex jones show sunday 4 to 6 pm central time and also
[02:54:19.420 --> 02:54:26.380]  monday i know there will be some big breaking news monday on obamacare and some hidden
[02:54:26.380 --> 02:54:31.900]  payoffs to big pharma that we have located in the obamacare so-called affordable health care act
[02:54:31.900 --> 02:54:36.860]  which has made health care unaffordable for almost everyone but dr wakefield continues with us in the
[02:54:36.860 --> 02:54:42.300]  studio here for this last segment so let's get right to the question of psychiatric drugs and
[02:54:42.300 --> 02:54:48.620]  their links to violent shooters time and time again dr wakefield although i know perhaps
[02:54:49.420 --> 02:54:54.860]  psychiatry obviously is not your specialty but you are well-trained m-d or you're skeptical
[02:54:54.860 --> 02:54:59.100]  thinking scientist what are your thoughts on psychiatric drugs and violent shootings
[02:54:59.100 --> 02:55:03.020]  well you know it's interesting because it comes it brings in the subject of autism again when
[02:55:03.020 --> 02:55:07.980]  back in 1996 i got i was first introduced to this i don't remember the port arthur massacre in
[02:55:07.980 --> 02:55:14.780]  tasmania a guy in the early morning shot over 40 people 45 people dead in a cafe and it was said
[02:55:14.780 --> 02:55:19.980]  at the time that he had asperger syndrome high functioning autism in fact he didn't at all and
[02:55:19.980 --> 02:55:24.380]  when you go back and read the psychiatric records from the prison psychiatrist who assessed him
[02:55:24.380 --> 02:55:29.660]  there he had symptoms which specifically precluded asperger's in other words the common denominator
[02:55:29.660 --> 02:55:35.020]  was not that they had a psychiatric or a an autistic spectrum disorder so i went back and
[02:55:35.020 --> 02:55:40.540]  i reviewed so many of these cases that have occurred of multiple killings actions of mass
[02:55:40.540 --> 02:55:45.020]  violence in schools or some shopping malls i'm looking for a common denominator it comes down
[02:55:45.020 --> 02:55:49.340]  to this mic looking for patterns what is the pattern is it an autistic spectrum disorder
[02:55:49.340 --> 02:55:54.780]  no is it a personality disorder no what was the common denominator was that they were all taking
[02:55:54.780 --> 02:56:00.700]  psychotropic medications and in many cases psychotropic medications that were not licensed
[02:56:00.700 --> 02:56:05.180]  not indicated for the particular problem that they had there is no site or there certainly
[02:56:05.180 --> 02:56:09.820]  was at that time no psychotropic medication that could be used for treating asperger's and what we
[02:56:09.820 --> 02:56:16.140]  now find is that in the last few years jansen pharmaceutical subsidiary of j and j abbott
[02:56:16.140 --> 02:56:20.700]  laboratories and glaxo smith klein have been pushing these drugs off label to vulnerable
[02:56:20.700 --> 02:56:24.940]  children in many cases and they've been sued by some states for the off-label marketing of their
[02:56:24.940 --> 02:56:29.260]  drugs as well absolutely and i've seen this at first hand i've seen violence in children with
[02:56:29.260 --> 02:56:33.340]  autism at first hand not because they're autistic but i believe because they're being pushed these
[02:56:33.340 --> 02:56:39.900]  drugs off license uh for inducements like going to a gulf day or going to the spa it's absolutely
[02:56:39.900 --> 02:56:46.620]  farcical and disgraceful that doctors have uh put children at risk giving them these powerful drugs
[02:56:46.620 --> 02:56:51.820]  that were never indicated for the problems that they have and i believe that a large part of the
[02:56:51.820 --> 02:56:56.380]  risk factor for these outbreaks of mass violence is the drugs that they're on well well said and
[02:56:56.380 --> 02:57:01.020]  just to clarify when i say they they've been sued by the states i don't know if those you mentioned
[02:57:01.020 --> 02:57:05.100]  have been sued but i know by and large big pharmaceutical companies have been sued time and
[02:57:05.100 --> 02:57:10.140]  time those three have okay that's good to confirm one of the things we know about these drugs is
[02:57:10.140 --> 02:57:16.300]  they tend to create a sense of cognitive detachment from reality so for example the columbine shooters
[02:57:16.300 --> 02:57:21.100]  said that they believe they they were playing out a first-person shooter video game so some people
[02:57:21.100 --> 02:57:27.820]  might start to blame the video games but i think more is the mindset the the the detachment in the
[02:57:27.820 --> 02:57:33.580]  mind that's caused by the psychiatric drugs so is this detachment something that you've also seen as
[02:57:33.580 --> 02:57:38.700]  a pattern in other violent outbursts well it's difficult to tell exactly what's going on in the
[02:57:38.700 --> 02:57:44.540]  mind of people when they're having for example violent ideation are they playing a game do they
[02:57:44.540 --> 02:57:49.500]  suddenly feel the world is against them with the ssris the second generation antidepressants it's
[02:57:49.500 --> 02:57:53.740]  often violence and those people who have no history whatsoever of violent behavior they
[02:57:53.740 --> 02:57:58.540]  suddenly have these violent outbursts and i've seen it in some of our patients and it stops when
[02:57:58.540 --> 02:58:03.420]  we stop the drug and isn't it interesting that obama's 23 executive orders not one of them
[02:58:04.460 --> 02:58:09.580]  looked at the link between psychiatric drugs and violent shootings so he may be ignoring
[02:58:09.580 --> 02:58:14.060]  the actual cause of all this he may be i don't know you don't know but we do know that that's
[02:58:14.060 --> 02:58:18.860]  a common denominator and to miss it out in trying to find the culprit for these outbreaks means that
[02:58:18.860 --> 02:58:22.380]  there are going to be more and more of these attacks because they're not getting to the heart
[02:58:22.380 --> 02:58:26.620]  the core problem that is causing them the first well they want more attacks dr wakefield they
[02:58:26.620 --> 02:58:31.660]  want more attacks because it'll let them ban more firearms knives hammers you name it thank
[02:58:31.660 --> 02:58:35.340]  you for being on the show dr wakefield retransmission begins now and thank you
[02:58:35.340 --> 02:58:49.500]  for joining us today here on the alex jones show this is mike adams take care
