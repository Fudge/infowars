[00:00.000 --> 00:10.880]  Troops occupying Washington D.C. haven't been sent home after the imaginary threat persisting
[00:10.880 --> 00:12.420]  on Inauguration Day.
[00:12.420 --> 00:14.480]  Will they ever be sent home?
[00:14.480 --> 00:16.920]  What is the specific threat?
[00:16.920 --> 00:17.920]  What group?
[00:17.920 --> 00:18.920]  What's the size of it?
[00:18.920 --> 00:26.360]  What are its capabilities that requires us to have more soldiers sitting in a few square
[00:26.360 --> 00:31.600]  blocks on our capital than we have in all of Iraq and Afghanistan combined?
[00:31.600 --> 00:39.360]  We will probably need a supplemental for more security for members when the enemy is within
[00:39.360 --> 00:41.400]  the House of Representatives.
[00:41.400 --> 00:46.200]  And let me be clear, the logistics involved in moving 25,000 people from every state and
[00:46.200 --> 00:51.400]  territory to D.C. in less than two weeks and supporting them is unprecedented.
[00:51.400 --> 00:57.200]  General, you know, 12 Guard soldiers were removed right before the inaugural, I guess
[00:57.200 --> 01:01.800]  two for incendiary comments, 10 others also removed.
[01:01.800 --> 01:06.440]  Did that have to do with extremism and have you had to remove anyone else since then for
[01:06.440 --> 01:07.440]  whatever reason?
[01:07.440 --> 01:10.920]  We had 25,000 plus guardsmen here.
[01:10.920 --> 01:16.640]  The FBI said that 12 didn't tell us why, just said that 12 were questionable and we're
[01:16.640 --> 01:20.040]  not taking any chances, we're not accepting any risk.
[01:20.040 --> 01:23.000]  We sent those guardsmen back to their home state.
[01:23.000 --> 01:28.360]  As the Wall Street Journal reported, some congressional staffers and extremism researchers
[01:28.360 --> 01:33.840]  say there are concerns about possible violence surrounding former President Donald Trump's
[01:33.840 --> 01:40.600]  impeachment proceedings as well as in connection with March 4th, the nation's original inauguration
[01:40.600 --> 01:41.600]  day.
[01:41.600 --> 01:47.200]  QAnon conspiracy theorists say that could be the day that Mr. Trump again becomes president.
[01:47.200 --> 01:53.360]  So the best they can come up with is that people may be angry that Congress is violating
[01:53.360 --> 02:00.120]  the Constitution in a pointless display of TDS-inspired impeachment and that QAnon is
[02:00.120 --> 02:02.680]  calling the shots for the GOP.
[02:02.680 --> 02:10.360]  And it increasingly seems, unfortunately, that in the House Republican caucus, Kevin
[02:10.360 --> 02:14.640]  McCarthy answers to these QAnon members of Congress, not the other way around.
[02:14.640 --> 02:20.000]  Joe Biden, sitting behind the razor wire in troops, has now signed a record 40 executive
[02:20.000 --> 02:22.120]  orders in a week's time.
[02:22.120 --> 02:27.920]  An autocratic act labeled a dictatorship in Biden's own words during the campaign.
[02:27.920 --> 02:29.680]  We are a democracy.
[02:29.680 --> 02:33.720]  Some of my Republican friends and some of my Democratic friends even occasionally say,
[02:33.720 --> 02:37.640]  well, if you can't get the votes by executive order, you're going to do something.
[02:37.640 --> 02:40.600]  Things you can't do by executive order unless you're a dictator.
[02:40.600 --> 02:41.600]  We're a democracy.
[02:41.600 --> 02:42.600]  We need consensus.
[02:42.600 --> 02:47.480]  Biden has also proceeded over a stock market rigged in favor of hedge fund billionaires
[02:47.480 --> 02:50.320]  tied to his Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.
[02:50.320 --> 02:57.760]  Yeah, so she received $810,000 from Citadel for past speaking gigs and Citadel infused
[02:57.760 --> 03:02.760]  Melvin Capital Management with billions when they got hammered for their GameStop shorts.
[03:02.760 --> 03:07.840]  So this raises the question, should Janet Yellen, as Treasury Secretary, recuse herself
[03:07.840 --> 03:12.000]  from advising the Biden administration on what to do about GameStop?
[03:12.000 --> 03:17.440]  Biden destroyed 70,000 jobs, a presidential record, in his first day in office.
[03:17.440 --> 03:22.040]  Not to mention he has opened the borders for tens of thousands of COVID migrants to spread
[03:22.040 --> 03:28.160]  into the United States during what he has described as the darkest days of the pandemic.
[03:28.160 --> 03:30.800]  And here's the simple truth.
[03:30.800 --> 03:36.560]  Our darkest days in the battle against COVID are ahead of us, not behind us.
[03:36.560 --> 03:41.320]  Meanwhile, Biden's friends and family are licking their chops over further sweetheart
[03:41.320 --> 03:43.320]  foreign nepotism deals.
[03:43.320 --> 03:48.200]  The Biden family apparently still using Joe and Joe's name for business.
[03:48.200 --> 03:54.160]  Look at this ad that Joe Biden's brother has been promoting.
[03:54.160 --> 03:59.240]  This is Frank Biden, and he's promoting his relationship to his brother, the Commander
[03:59.240 --> 04:05.040]  in Chief, in an inauguration day advertisement for the law firm that he advises.
[04:05.040 --> 04:07.920]  Well, Biden Inc. is still in business.
[04:07.920 --> 04:13.480]  Maria, I just ask you, what does a senior non-attorney advisor do in a law firm?
[04:13.480 --> 04:14.480]  He makes connections.
[04:14.480 --> 04:20.000]  He peddles his influence, and there was another report, by the way, that Hunter Biden apparently
[04:20.000 --> 04:23.920]  he was supposed to give up all his ownership in these Chinese companies, but a report came
[04:23.920 --> 04:29.400]  out yesterday that the city still apparently has his 10% stake in BHR, that private equity
[04:29.400 --> 04:30.400]  firm in China.
[04:30.400 --> 04:35.640]  Of course, we can't talk about this on social media because you will be labeled, you will
[04:35.640 --> 04:39.160]  be attacked because you're talking about a truthful story.
[04:39.160 --> 04:44.440]  At this rate, Biden will be known globally as the first dictator the United States has
[04:44.440 --> 04:45.440]  ever seen.
[04:45.440 --> 05:15.080]  John Bowne reporting.
[05:16.080 --> 05:16.840]  They were desperate.
[05:16.840 --> 05:18.320]  They admitted their own publications.
[05:18.320 --> 05:23.280]  They didn't know what to do, and so they put out 80 million fake ballots, violated state
[05:23.280 --> 05:27.080]  law, and stole it better than death.
[05:27.080 --> 05:30.160]  And now they're coming after the president, they're coming after you, they're coming after
[05:30.160 --> 05:35.200]  me, they're shutting everybody off the internet, they're trying to totally censor us, and that's
[05:35.200 --> 05:39.040]  why M4 Wars is still in the fight because we knew this was coming.
[05:39.040 --> 05:40.040]  We told you this was coming.
[05:40.040 --> 05:45.000]  We were the first main target, and we're still on air at M4Wars.com, and NewsWars.com, and
[05:45.000 --> 05:46.640]  Band-Aid video.
[05:46.640 --> 05:49.960]  Without your word of mouth, without your prayer, without your financial support, we can't stay
[05:49.960 --> 05:50.960]  on air.
[05:50.960 --> 05:55.360]  So while you still can, go to M4Wars.com and get storeable foods and high quality products,
[05:55.360 --> 05:57.960]  supplements, you name it, at M4Wars.com.
[05:57.960 --> 06:18.960]  It's Tuesday, February 2nd, 2021, I'm Alex Jones, your host, I'll be here live for the
[06:18.960 --> 06:26.880]  next four hours, and I intend to open the phones up throughout the next four hours.
[06:26.880 --> 06:32.920]  Well, Joseph Watson will be joining us coming up, and Robert Barnes is joining us again.
[06:32.920 --> 06:36.840]  Not to talk about the Trump impeachment trial that's coming, we joined us yesterday to talk
[06:36.840 --> 06:41.680]  about that, but to talk about the martial law being brought into the country and into
[06:41.680 --> 06:45.160]  the world right now, and why the globalists are doing that.
[06:45.160 --> 06:51.200]  All right, a lot of news, a lot of incredible information that is empowering and enlightening
[06:51.200 --> 06:52.600]  will be breaking down today.
[06:52.600 --> 06:56.360]  And remember, when we cover all these negative, horrible things, the enemy wants to keep them
[06:56.360 --> 07:00.040]  secret until they're able to take full control.
[07:00.040 --> 07:04.840]  We are going to put the evidence out there that they're the bad guys, that they are usurping
[07:04.840 --> 07:13.240]  us, that they are enslaving us in their own words so that humanity can start non-compliance.
[07:13.240 --> 07:17.740]  And then building our own economies and own systems so that we can live into the future
[07:17.740 --> 07:24.320]  outside of this super predatory system that's being established that will not let us live
[07:24.320 --> 07:28.080]  in peace, but will never stop until it dominates and control us.
[07:28.080 --> 07:33.680]  Thomas Jefferson was asked in a letter from the French, what level of tyranny man would
[07:33.680 --> 07:34.680]  live under?
[07:34.680 --> 07:39.080]  And he said, any amount of tyranny that you will allow, there is always a tyrant who will
[07:39.080 --> 07:44.560]  be willing to take you to that point and pass it.
[07:44.560 --> 07:45.560]  It's a vacuum.
[07:45.560 --> 07:51.880]  In nature of horrors of vacuum, submarines have thick armored bulkheads that seal because
[07:51.880 --> 07:58.040]  under pressure, water begins to have incredible power to break through.
[07:58.040 --> 08:03.480]  So if a submarine is at a couple thousand feet deep, it's got foot-thick walls on it
[08:03.480 --> 08:08.000]  and giant vacuum seals because that water wants to get in.
[08:08.000 --> 08:13.240]  And when you don't have a Bill of Rights or Constitution, we don't have rugged individuals
[08:13.240 --> 08:15.120]  that stand up for freedom.
[08:15.120 --> 08:19.760]  When you don't have people that are territorial about their basic rights, it's like having
[08:19.760 --> 08:23.440]  a submarine with open doors on it.
[08:23.440 --> 08:26.000]  The minute you go underwater, you flood out.
[08:26.000 --> 08:32.200]  And we've gone over the edge, the bottom's falling out, use whatever analogy you want.
[08:32.200 --> 08:38.680]  But every tyranny that has been pent up for thousands of years, every tyranny ever invented
[08:38.680 --> 08:47.000]  and even new ones are now exploding like a metastasizing cancer throughout the body.
[08:47.000 --> 08:52.360]  And so people ask Jones, how are you taking it?
[08:52.360 --> 08:59.560]  I know that my head's on the chopping block in this system, but so is yours.
[08:59.560 --> 09:02.240]  And so I don't fear this at all.
[09:02.240 --> 09:06.320]  I actually just get extremely frustrated that we're going to go through this, just part
[09:06.320 --> 09:08.400]  of the process and part of the cycle.
[09:08.400 --> 09:12.720]  And the globalists know there's a cycle that tyranny builds up because of corruption and
[09:12.720 --> 09:15.640]  because of laziness and then collapses of its own weight.
[09:15.640 --> 09:21.000]  They believe by building a post-human world and training us not to know how to take care
[09:21.000 --> 09:26.160]  of ourselves and domesticating us that when we collapse this time, the machines will rise
[09:26.160 --> 09:29.560]  and we will never stand up again.
[09:29.560 --> 09:34.800]  But history has shown that even though it'll be a minority of people that understand this
[09:34.800 --> 09:39.280]  and resist it, that minority is still so massive that there's no way the globalists are going
[09:39.280 --> 09:40.280]  to win.
[09:40.280 --> 09:43.440]  And I've got a lot of examples of this here today.
[09:43.440 --> 09:48.720]  In fact, let's get this video clip, I forgot to send it to you guys, it's on inforwars.com,
[09:48.720 --> 09:50.960]  talking to the crew.
[09:50.960 --> 09:56.560]  Politico reporter panics Trump's base is getting stronger since he left office, and that ties
[09:56.560 --> 10:03.200]  together with the lady that won in the biggest landslide for Republicans despite fraud in
[10:03.200 --> 10:09.600]  Georgia, Marjorie Taylor Green, who's an awesome lady, they're calling her a cancer for the
[10:09.600 --> 10:12.560]  Republican Party, that's Mitch McConnell.
[10:12.560 --> 10:20.120]  So somebody that won 75% with 100% of Democrats voting, which we know is a lie, so despite
[10:20.120 --> 10:27.080]  all the fraud, she won by 75, she probably won by 90%, took the number show.
[10:27.080 --> 10:29.960]  So winning like that is cancer.
[10:29.960 --> 10:41.440]  She's real, she's not backing down, she's focused, she's angry, and she resonated with
[10:41.440 --> 10:44.240]  the people of Georgia, black, white, old, young.
[10:44.240 --> 10:49.560]  So we'll be talking about some of that and just look at these incredible headlines.
[10:49.560 --> 10:54.400]  New York Times calls for Biden to appoint a reality czar, that's not a joke, to fight
[10:54.400 --> 10:56.920]  misinformation.
[10:56.920 --> 11:04.400]  And it sounds like someone writing a future part two of 1984, call it 2021, where you
[11:04.400 --> 11:08.640]  sickeningly talk about how great tyranny is and how wonderful it is, but you do it with
[11:08.640 --> 11:10.480]  a smile on your face to gas like people.
[11:10.480 --> 11:15.400]  It was cartoons they came out with from the UN and the Davos group 10 years ago in England
[11:15.400 --> 11:20.040]  where they teach school kids, you only leave your house once a year, you'll eat bugs, robots
[11:20.040 --> 11:23.040]  will run your life, you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing.
[11:23.040 --> 11:28.040]  And you watch it, you know, this is the most horrible supermax prison thing you can imagine,
[11:28.040 --> 11:31.160]  but see for children, they're being prepared.
[11:31.160 --> 11:37.000]  They're adapting to the tyranny, not overcoming it, which is what the globalist plan to do.
[11:37.000 --> 11:44.360]  So look at that incredible headline, and then it continues on, Creepy Bill Gates calls
[11:44.360 --> 11:49.360]  for global alert system, that means a global government, and Pandemic Fire Squad, that's
[11:49.360 --> 11:55.680]  the UN Rapid Reaction Force, with Dr. Green and Dr. Ryan.
[11:55.680 --> 11:59.080]  Both of them have said, Ryan's the head, and he said, we're going to come in your house
[11:59.080 --> 12:01.520]  and take your children and take your family.
[12:01.520 --> 12:05.560]  So it's a UN force funded by the Billow Bill and the Gates Foundation, controlled by them
[12:05.560 --> 12:09.440]  and the Clinton Global Initiative, that's the contact tracers worldwide that come to
[12:09.440 --> 12:11.200]  your house with police power.
[12:11.200 --> 12:16.960]  And the CDC just announced police power and executive order over the weekend, signed by
[12:16.960 --> 12:21.440]  Biden saying you will wear two masks, and if you're caught out at any type of transport
[12:21.440 --> 12:24.240]  without your mask, you will face federal prison.
[12:24.240 --> 12:31.760]  There's total intimidation, total fraud, and as Biden said, the worst is yet to come.
[12:31.760 --> 12:38.840]  Everybody's like, oh, as soon as Trump's out, you know, they'll turn things back on because
[12:38.840 --> 12:39.840]  they like to make money.
[12:39.840 --> 12:41.240]  You know, they own the money machines.
[12:41.240 --> 12:43.120]  They want to bankrupt you to fully control you.
[12:43.120 --> 12:46.160]  They want trained prisoners.
[12:46.160 --> 12:50.560]  Everything you see in China is coming here, not years from now, months from now.
[12:50.560 --> 12:54.240]  Everything you see in the UK is coming here in months, not years.
[12:54.240 --> 12:56.680]  The bottom has fallen out.
[12:56.680 --> 13:02.920]  You let the submarine door open, so it's here, and they're making their move.
[13:02.920 --> 13:06.040]  For your guns, for your children, for your life, by the way, that they've introduced
[13:06.040 --> 13:08.240]  the bill, looks like it's going to pass.
[13:08.240 --> 13:12.680]  House Bill would require psych tests, liability insurance for all gun owners, make everyone
[13:12.680 --> 13:17.040]  register their guns, and if anyone even says they think you're a threat, not a judge, not
[13:17.040 --> 13:19.400]  a jury, your guns are taken for good.
[13:19.400 --> 13:25.280]  And Laura Loomer's already been put on the hyper red flag list.
[13:25.280 --> 13:30.000]  So there you go, absolute interview process, overturning the Constitution.
[13:30.000 --> 13:31.000]  They don't care.
[13:31.000 --> 13:36.680]  It looks like they have the votes in the Senate as well, tyranny in common.
[13:36.680 --> 13:38.880]  It's a year.
[13:38.880 --> 13:45.760]  But I want to hit the whole COVID lockdown and the war that it is, the economic siege
[13:45.760 --> 13:53.360]  against free humanity when we come back from break, and how only awakening to that fact
[13:53.360 --> 13:56.920]  and only admitting it to ourselves will ever turn us around.
[13:56.920 --> 14:02.320]  It's censorship, it's disarmament, it's medical tyranny, it's squads coming to your house,
[14:02.320 --> 14:06.720]  it's political correctness, it's brainwashing, it's saying the country shouldn't even exist,
[14:06.720 --> 14:10.640]  it's a bankrupting system to bring you to your knees, it is a total surveillance grid
[14:10.640 --> 14:16.280]  to carry it out, and it's big tech and the UN and different agencies all declaring police
[14:16.280 --> 14:20.040]  powers over you and your family.
[14:20.040 --> 14:24.680]  It is in short an authoritarian post human world government.
[14:24.680 --> 14:29.120]  But they're ushering in the straight jacket and the handcuffs is to bring in the phase
[14:29.120 --> 14:34.960]  out of humanity with so much 5G and so much GMO and so many deadly vaccines that you're
[14:34.960 --> 14:39.400]  dying and you're begging to die because you're so miserable by the end of it and then they
[14:39.400 --> 14:43.360]  just reclamate you out, phase you out.
[14:43.360 --> 14:50.800]  And as the stated, ultra psychotic gold of Bill Gates, Ted Turner, Prince William, Prince
[14:50.800 --> 14:56.600]  Charles, of course Jeffrey Epstein was in part of a sex club providing underage people
[14:56.600 --> 15:01.600]  for these scientists to induct them into the club, money, drugs, little kids, whatever
[15:01.600 --> 15:04.760]  they wanted, you got them.
[15:04.760 --> 15:10.760]  And that's where this is going, absolute corruption, Joe Biden able to engage in any corruption
[15:10.760 --> 15:16.760]  he wants, able to sell the office publicly with Hunter, all of it being done in a spectacular
[15:16.760 --> 15:23.840]  fashion to rub your nose in it while they set up paramilitary martial law and troops
[15:23.840 --> 15:27.960]  saying that protesting election fraud or not agreeing with this is terrorism.
[15:27.960 --> 15:32.240]  So they're making their move for your children, your health, your property, your guns, your
[15:32.240 --> 15:34.320]  psyche, your soul.
[15:34.320 --> 15:39.560]  They want your soul, period.
[15:39.560 --> 15:43.400]  They want control of your psyche, control of your focus.
[15:43.400 --> 15:46.920]  They want to make you focus everything on them, which is a paradox.
[15:46.920 --> 15:50.560]  I have to expose them to defeat them, but I hate having to focus on them.
[15:50.560 --> 15:51.560]  That's the other part of the paradigm.
[15:51.560 --> 15:57.200]  We have to all build our own systems now and celebrate those with our black stay votes.
[15:57.200 --> 16:00.560]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[16:00.560 --> 16:04.900]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[16:04.900 --> 16:09.600]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[16:09.600 --> 16:14.120]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[16:14.120 --> 16:18.920]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[16:18.920 --> 16:24.640]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide
[16:24.640 --> 16:30.640]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[16:30.640 --> 16:37.280]  Studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[16:37.280 --> 16:41.880]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[16:41.880 --> 16:47.680]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[16:47.680 --> 16:50.480]  facts that pertain to reality.
[16:50.480 --> 17:19.320]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[17:20.840 --> 17:25.040]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks, I'm going to give that person over there a
[17:25.040 --> 17:26.040]  better life.
[17:26.040 --> 17:27.040]  I'm going to wake up today.
[17:27.040 --> 17:28.040]  You know what?
[17:28.040 --> 17:31.000]  I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier,
[17:31.000 --> 17:32.000]  and richer.
[17:32.000 --> 17:33.600]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[17:33.600 --> 17:35.200]  I don't think that happens very often.
[17:35.200 --> 17:36.200]  It's never happened to me.
[17:36.200 --> 17:38.920]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[17:38.920 --> 17:40.680]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[17:40.680 --> 17:43.400]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[17:43.400 --> 17:44.960]  I woke up and thought, you know what?
[17:44.960 --> 17:46.400]  Okay, I want to take control of my life.
[17:46.400 --> 17:49.200]  I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com.
[17:49.200 --> 17:51.640]  Take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[17:51.640 --> 17:52.640]  Don't buy into the groupthink.
[17:52.640 --> 17:53.800]  Don't drink the Kool-Aid.
[17:53.800 --> 17:54.800]  Drink the Turbo Force.
[17:54.800 --> 18:24.640]  The Kool-Aid's bad and the Turbo Force is good.
[18:24.640 --> 18:50.640]  The Kool-Aid's bad and the Turbo Force is good, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com.
[18:50.640 --> 19:20.440]  The Kool-Aid's bad and the Turbo Force is good, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com.
[19:20.440 --> 19:42.440]  The Kool-Aid's bad and the Turbo Force is good, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com.
[19:42.440 --> 20:08.440]  The Kool-Aid's bad and the Turbo Force is good, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com.
[20:08.440 --> 20:30.440]  The Kool-Aid's bad and the Turbo Force is good, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com.
[20:30.440 --> 20:56.440]  The Kool-Aid's bad and the Turbo Force is good, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com.
[20:56.440 --> 21:24.440]  The Kool-Aid's bad and the Turbo Force is good, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com.
[21:24.440 --> 21:52.440]  The Kool-Aid's bad and the Turbo Force is good, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com.
[21:52.440 --> 21:59.440]  Yes, there were 30,000-plus troops in D.C. It got cut down to 10,000. Now they want 10,000 more.
[21:59.440 --> 22:05.440]  They want permanent 20,000 troops and permanent 20-foot walls with spikes on them,
[22:05.440 --> 22:12.440]  and I've got the former deputy director of the CIA and counterterrorism last week
[22:12.440 --> 22:18.440]  and now another high-level CIA operative in the Washington Post today saying,
[22:18.440 --> 22:27.440]  we're going to hunt down conservatives, that's a quote, hunt down conservatives, hunt down, incredibly provocative.
[22:27.440 --> 22:30.440]  So they know they've stolen the country, they know they're dividing it, they know they're breaking it down,
[22:30.440 --> 22:36.440]  they know they're going to bankrupt it fully and bring in a permanent lockdown that they'll turn up and down,
[22:36.440 --> 22:40.440]  but you'll always be in it. It's all been announced, and they know you're rejecting them,
[22:40.440 --> 22:46.440]  and they know you elected Trump in a landslide, and so they just want to start a physical fight with us now.
[22:46.440 --> 22:51.440]  So navigating this is going to be extremely important. We don't have a choice.
[22:51.440 --> 22:58.440]  I mean, you're in this, and so here's what Tony Robbins had to say in the videos up on m4wars.com.
[22:58.440 --> 23:01.440]  I did a report last night accompanying it and backed up some of what he said,
[23:01.440 --> 23:05.440]  but the folks on Twitter looked into what he said. It's the same thing we've told you.
[23:05.440 --> 23:08.440]  We've got John Hopkins' own numbers, we've got their own numbers now for the whole year.
[23:08.440 --> 23:12.440]  Roughly the same number of people died in 2020 that died in 2019.
[23:12.440 --> 23:16.440]  You think it would be more because the population goes up and the population's aging,
[23:16.440 --> 23:21.440]  so it actually, each year had a bigger increase in death on average up until 2020
[23:21.440 --> 23:25.440]  because a lot of folks weren't out driving cars, they think, but those numbers are there.
[23:25.440 --> 23:29.440]  So I'm going to say it again. Same number roughly died in 2020, died in 2019,
[23:29.440 --> 23:36.440]  but when you hear thousands a day dying in the winter of COVID, it's really pneumonia and colds, that always happens.
[23:36.440 --> 23:42.440]  15,000 people coming in the U.S. a day coming out a day. You know, the Reaper.
[23:42.440 --> 23:49.440]  Some days it's 8,000, some days it's 20,000. The average is about 14,000 people come in and come out of the world.
[23:49.440 --> 23:52.440]  A little more come in than come out. Coming in, coming out, coming out.
[23:52.440 --> 23:57.440]  But they can show, whoa, they showed you those 10,000, 15,000 people dying a day and you saw each one.
[23:57.440 --> 24:04.440]  You'd go, my God, there's death everywhere. No, there's 360 million people in this country.
[24:04.440 --> 24:10.440]  10,000, 15,000 coming in, coming out every day. A couple thousand, they say COVID, it's none of it's true,
[24:10.440 --> 24:16.440]  but it's a perception. It's why Stalin said one man dies as a tragedy, 10,000 dies as a statistic.
[24:16.440 --> 24:21.440]  He'd wipe out whole towns of 10,000 people routinely. Just starve or death or kill them.
[24:21.440 --> 24:26.440]  And nobody cared because it was just, you just, how do you deal with millions killed?
[24:26.440 --> 24:34.440]  The Coolies, the poor Russians, but not the poorest. They were the poor group that had a little bit of land.
[24:34.440 --> 24:41.440]  Maybe 10 acres, 20 acres, the Coolies. And they killed 20 million of them.
[24:41.440 --> 24:47.440]  And it's just, eh, 20 million, eh, 20 million. So it's like the 10 million extra starve to death from the lockdown.
[24:47.440 --> 24:51.440]  And you can even argue, well, the third world's overpopulated. Okay, are you going to go kill those kids?
[24:51.440 --> 24:56.440]  The same people telling you Black Lives Matter and America's Evil and all this crap are the very ones telling you
[24:56.440 --> 25:00.440]  well the earth's overpopulated. And the guy that runs the vaccine program and the world government,
[25:00.440 --> 25:03.440]  Bill Gates, is the guy that says he wants to reduce world population.
[25:03.440 --> 25:07.440]  So see the full video at newswars.com. Here is Tony Robinson.
[25:07.440 --> 25:13.440]  Just going to read John Hopkins' report. They took it down after one day, but two weeks ago they came out here in America.
[25:13.440 --> 25:19.440]  They took it down, but if you go on the wave machine, you know, you can go back on your computer and go back in time on the web.
[25:19.440 --> 25:25.440]  So people have already published it again and again. And what it shows is the same number of people have died this year,
[25:25.440 --> 25:32.440]  2020 has died in 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 2.8 million people.
[25:32.440 --> 25:38.440]  It's within 10 to 15,000 people every year. The same number of old people died in 2020.
[25:38.440 --> 25:45.440]  The only difference is when they looked by disease, heart disease for the first time in 30 years has come down.
[25:45.440 --> 25:52.440]  Cancer has come down, but COVID has gone up in the exact proportions.
[25:52.440 --> 25:56.440]  Now that's interesting, isn't it? Same number of people died.
[25:56.440 --> 26:01.440]  By the way, in case you haven't noticed, the flu has disappeared. It's flatlined.
[26:01.440 --> 26:07.440]  What are the symptoms of the flu? And by the way, flu kills people and especially goes older people.
[26:07.440 --> 26:12.440]  So we're looking at a world where a lot of people might be overreacting because they're trying to protect us
[26:12.440 --> 26:17.440]  because they thought at a 3% mortality rate or 4% that would be a pandemic.
[26:17.440 --> 26:24.440]  But today, you know, whose research you read is 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, which is the same as the flu.
[26:24.440 --> 26:27.440]  And if you're under 50, it's way below that.
[26:27.440 --> 26:33.440]  So we live in a world that if we let people control our focus, we're just going to live in fear and do nothing.
[26:33.440 --> 26:43.440]  And we're going to be people that manage our circumstances.
[27:03.440 --> 27:08.440]  In Singapore, for eight months, they've made citizens wear bracelets on their arms
[27:08.440 --> 27:12.440]  that make them a social distance and report them back to cell towers to track through every movement.
[27:12.440 --> 27:15.440]  This is for everybody, the way it gets better.
[27:15.440 --> 27:19.440]  Now France has programs in their factories, government, push, and sponsor
[27:19.440 --> 27:25.440]  to make everyone wear actual dog collars that make social distance and report back to their computers.
[27:25.440 --> 27:30.440]  They're turning us into a commodity. Human animal clones have been around for 50 years.
[27:30.440 --> 27:35.440]  It's all being announced. They are literally taking over the life cycle of humans and making us obsolete.
[27:35.440 --> 27:41.440]  And big corporations down the planet, they own us with these gene therapy systems and patents that they've produced.
[27:41.440 --> 27:45.440]  Do you understand? It is a takeover of the entire species at the genetic level.
[27:45.440 --> 27:50.440]  And now they're coming with dog collars and they're announcing in public schools in the U.S.
[27:50.440 --> 27:53.440]  Starting next year, it will begin. Did you hear me?
[27:53.440 --> 27:57.440]  Dog collars for your children all based on a hoax, all based on a lie.
[27:57.440 --> 28:00.440]  Info Wars continue to spread the word to fight back.
[28:00.440 --> 28:07.440]  Info Wars is a archetypal, classic example of free, independent, organic resistance against tyranny.
[28:07.440 --> 28:14.440]  You built Info Wars. You spread the word. You prayed for us. You bought the products. You called in.
[28:14.440 --> 28:18.440]  You made recommendations. Info Wars is as much yours as it is mine.
[28:18.440 --> 28:23.440]  And that's why the enemy is so upset that under the deplatforming, under all the DNC lawsuits,
[28:23.440 --> 28:27.440]  under all the attack, in many ways, we've become stronger.
[28:27.440 --> 28:32.440]  With banned.video, redesigned Info Wars, with all of our great crew, with documentary films,
[28:32.440 --> 28:38.440]  and ten hours of live radio and TV a day, we are the resistance. You are the resistance.
[28:38.440 --> 28:44.440]  So remember this arsenal of freedom is waiting for you to continue to spread the word about it
[28:44.440 --> 28:48.440]  and to continue for you to support because this is something we built together.
[28:48.440 --> 28:53.440]  It's not just a national treasure. It's a treasure worldwide against the tyrants and they know it
[28:53.440 --> 28:58.440]  and they can't stand it. And as everything we talked about comes true, our credibility only goes up together.
[28:58.440 --> 29:20.440]  So I salute you all.
[29:29.440 --> 29:33.440]  Many competitors sleep formulas focus only on getting you to sleep,
[29:33.440 --> 29:39.440]  but Rocket Rest was specifically formulated to help you feel rested and ready to take on the next day.
[29:39.440 --> 29:45.440]  It uses a unique quick release capsule system to ensure fast delivery of deep sleep support ingredients
[29:45.440 --> 29:50.440]  like melatonin and magnesium. Rocket Rest helps you fall asleep fast, stay asleep,
[29:50.440 --> 29:56.440]  and wake up feeling rested. So get the new Rocket Rest formula from Dr. Jones Naturals right now
[29:56.440 --> 30:03.440]  at FullerStore.com
[30:03.440 --> 30:29.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:29.440 --> 30:37.440]  The great reset is fifth-generational warfare against all forms of independent human activity.
[30:37.440 --> 30:42.440]  We know how to stop it. We can work together. Again, I played this clip six times the last six shows.
[30:42.440 --> 30:48.440]  I'm not going to play it again today. A Klaus Schwab at the Debo script it met last week,
[30:48.440 --> 30:55.440]  the former head of the UN sustainability project, Agenda 2030.
[30:55.440 --> 30:59.440]  He wrote Agenda 21. He's the main author. A bunch of people were involved in it.
[30:59.440 --> 31:06.440]  He said, there will be no more close proximity human activity ever, and the lockdown never stops.
[31:06.440 --> 31:11.440]  And this will save the carbon footprint and that robots will deliver you everything you need,
[31:11.440 --> 31:15.440]  and that you will quote, own nothing and have nothing, and that you will eat bugs.
[31:15.440 --> 31:20.440]  You understand, these are exact quotes. You will eat grubs and like them.
[31:20.440 --> 31:24.440]  You will own nothing. You will have nothing. And robots will deliver everything to you.
[31:24.440 --> 31:29.440]  And there will be no more industry or jobs where people are close to each other.
[31:29.440 --> 31:35.440]  That's called a prison cell. And even I'm shocked by how fast they moved.
[31:35.440 --> 31:44.440]  Because they have an incremental, incremental, incremental, incremental, incremental, incremental, incremental, incremental, and then just bam!
[31:44.440 --> 31:52.440]  And three years ago, I shot that video, or live rant, and they titled it, of course, this is why they banned Alex Jones.
[31:52.440 --> 32:00.440]  They're saying all that. I expect them to have a big major event, probably a bio weapon release,
[32:00.440 --> 32:08.440]  that will just hit at a certain point, and then everything caves in, and there's a total collapse by design, which they claim they're fighting.
[32:08.440 --> 32:12.440]  Oh, they're fighting COVID, but notice, oh my God, none of the lockdowns are working.
[32:12.440 --> 32:18.440]  None of the vaccines are working. There's hundreds of thousands dying. Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.
[32:18.440 --> 32:24.440]  Because the people don't have any perspective that there's 7.7 billion people,
[32:24.440 --> 32:30.440]  and that hundreds of thousands are dying a day worldwide.
[32:30.440 --> 32:40.440]  Of everything. And then the loss in the shuffle is that that's massively increased because of the COVID lockdown starvation.
[32:40.440 --> 32:47.440]  And again, oh, they give money to Black Lives Matter.
[32:47.440 --> 32:51.440]  All these big corporations, because then nobody talks about death camps in China.
[32:51.440 --> 32:59.440]  Nobody talks about the raping of Africa. And listen, I don't sit there with some virtue signaler.
[32:59.440 --> 33:05.440]  Oh, I love the Africans so much. I'm so good. I'm upset they're slaughtering them and killing them.
[33:05.440 --> 33:14.440]  I innately have empathy, because I know if it's done to them, it's done to me.
[33:14.440 --> 33:21.440]  It's just hardwired. It's not even a virtue. It's just what I've got.
[33:21.440 --> 33:30.440]  You know, you watch those videos in Saudi Arabia where somebody got caught stealing a loaf of bread and they chopped their right hand off.
[33:30.440 --> 33:37.440]  And man, even though I don't like thieves, I have empathy watching that hand fall off and blood shoot out of that sucker.
[33:37.440 --> 33:42.440]  But see, these psychos and these sociopaths, they don't have empathy.
[33:42.440 --> 33:47.440]  And once you don't resist them, once you grease the skids, the slippery slope is a cliff.
[33:47.440 --> 33:52.440]  It's not a slope. And baby, we're in free fall.
[33:52.440 --> 34:00.440]  So I got a million things to cover, and I'm going to open the phones up and take your calls.
[34:00.440 --> 34:14.440]  But the most positive thing you can do is realize that going along with this is not going to help you.
[34:14.440 --> 34:18.440]  In fact, if you were just a real sociopath, but they always have that added evil.
[34:18.440 --> 34:20.440]  So a sociopath doesn't just do what's good for them.
[34:20.440 --> 34:22.440]  They have to do something that's actually bad.
[34:22.440 --> 34:24.440]  Psychology gets that wrong with what they call a sociopath.
[34:24.440 --> 34:28.440]  Most sociopaths I know actually want to make the wrong decision because they're screwed up.
[34:28.440 --> 34:31.440]  It's not just that they do what's good for them. They like to do bad stuff.
[34:31.440 --> 34:33.440]  They like raw power.
[34:33.440 --> 34:39.440]  But if you were just a clear, like robotic sociopath, knowing about the New World Order and fighting it
[34:39.440 --> 34:49.440]  and building alternative systems would be extremely culturally, physically, and monetarily good for you.
[34:49.440 --> 34:52.440]  But see, there's something about sociopaths they like to join with the power structure,
[34:52.440 --> 34:57.440]  and they like hierarchical systems, so they're always wanting to get into something already established
[34:57.440 --> 35:04.440]  and try to climb the ladder in that because they're not creative people.
[35:04.440 --> 35:09.440]  They miss the divine spark of God that we have, and we do have it.
[35:09.440 --> 35:13.440]  My goodness, look at what we've built. Look at our art, our literature, our music.
[35:13.440 --> 35:15.440]  Look at what we can do.
[35:15.440 --> 35:19.440]  Why can one music producer produce all the incredible music,
[35:19.440 --> 35:24.440]  and then the very same artist goes to another producer and can't make the beautiful music?
[35:24.440 --> 35:28.440]  Because there isn't the master conductor there.
[35:28.440 --> 35:31.440]  People may have one skill, they don't have the other.
[35:31.440 --> 35:36.440]  So it takes that human Congress, that human coming together, like a man and woman,
[35:36.440 --> 35:45.440]  or a music producer and an artist, or a conductor and a symphony.
[35:45.440 --> 35:50.440]  And as above so below, well, everything you see done on the mass scale is done at the low scale.
[35:50.440 --> 35:55.440]  So they don't want leadership, they don't want families, they don't want the coming together.
[35:55.440 --> 36:01.440]  They don't want the communion of humanity that is the ritual God gave us of who we are.
[36:01.440 --> 36:05.440]  The journey is the destination, it's totally true.
[36:05.440 --> 36:11.440]  They want us to be the governor of California, the American psycho.
[36:11.440 --> 36:15.440]  They want us to be the Michigan psycho.
[36:15.440 --> 36:18.440]  They want us to be the New York psycho, and you look at these people,
[36:18.440 --> 36:22.440]  and if you have a soul and discernment, no matter how physically ugly they are,
[36:22.440 --> 36:26.440]  or how physically attractive they are, they're dead, and they're synthetic,
[36:26.440 --> 36:33.440]  and they're something not human there, it's a transmission.
[36:33.440 --> 36:40.440]  You're seeing the twisted force of evil shine through their human flesh and out their eyes.
[36:40.440 --> 36:47.440]  They're no longer a human, they are a cup, a container holding something else.
[36:47.440 --> 36:52.440]  And so they cannot create, they can only invert.
[36:52.440 --> 36:55.440]  All right, I got a lot of news to cover.
[36:55.440 --> 36:58.440]  Who knew they'd openly declare martial law? That's basically what we're in.
[36:58.440 --> 37:04.440]  And thank God Tucker Carlson gets it. He says, Democrats mobilize US military to suppress domestic opinions.
[37:04.440 --> 37:08.440]  Carlson just gets better and better, and they go, oh my God, he's like Alex Jones.
[37:08.440 --> 37:12.440]  Now he's not Alex Jones, he sees the same thing I see. It's out of the open.
[37:12.440 --> 37:15.440]  I'm going to play some of that next segment, and then I'm going to go ahead and give the number out now.
[37:15.440 --> 37:19.440]  We can take your calls on how do we peacefully resist this?
[37:19.440 --> 37:22.440]  If you disagree and think we should be violent, I want to hear from you as well.
[37:22.440 --> 37:26.440]  We should have a debate about that. I think I can talk you out of this at this point.
[37:26.440 --> 37:29.440]  But I'd like to hear about what do we do about this takeover.
[37:29.440 --> 37:32.440]  If you disagree and think the Great Resets are a wonderful thing,
[37:32.440 --> 37:37.440]  or maybe you believe the New York Times, it doesn't exist, even though I can show you world leaders having meetings and saying it.
[37:37.440 --> 37:45.440]  You agree, you disagree, the world, Biden is shutting the economy off automatically, devastating us, we're under globalist war,
[37:45.440 --> 37:56.440]  we're under globalist siege. What is your take on this? 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[37:56.440 --> 38:06.440]  And some folks can't call 1-800 numbers because they're on internet phones, 512-646-1776, 512-646-1776.
[38:06.440 --> 38:13.440]  And then again, if you want to keep us on air, I didn't even warn the crew about this, but go to the t-shirt section of infoworkstore.com.
[38:13.440 --> 38:24.440]  We have four new shirts that I've designed, and they're F, Biden, F mask, F tyranny, and F something else.
[38:24.440 --> 38:31.440]  They're long sleeve, black sleeves with a white body, kind of a rock and roll, 1970 style shirt, and it's got a New York style license plate.
[38:31.440 --> 38:38.440]  It says, it's kind of like the license plate, it says free country, FK Biden, it's a little, little, little racy.
[38:38.440 --> 38:50.440]  And it says United States of America is a free country. So United States of America, free country, F Biden, and F mask, and F tyranny.
[38:50.440 --> 38:58.440]  It's all there, high quality shirt printed right here in Texas, infoworkstore.com, and there's some new shirts as well.
[38:58.440 --> 39:06.440]  We are all essential, infowars.com. That shirt is there. Humanity is essential is another variant.
[39:06.440 --> 39:11.440]  We've got some great summit shirts and jackets. I told you Paul was going to start producing more, writing more, doing more videos.
[39:11.440 --> 39:18.440]  If he got support, well that's happening. We also got, prepared by a veteran buddy of mine, designed Trader Joe's t-shirt.
[39:18.440 --> 39:27.440]  Very popular. Joe Biden says Trader Joe's in the same font as Trader Joe's grocery store, and it's got a Chinese flag, a Ukrainian flag,
[39:27.440 --> 39:34.440]  a Russian flag, and an Iranian flag. All the countries he's sold us out to. It's got five star reviews, 100% reviews.
[39:34.440 --> 39:39.440]  Shirt is extremely popular. It's got another big shipment of it in. We got a little shipment in. Sold it out in two days.
[39:39.440 --> 39:47.440]  Well, it's back in stock, infowars.com, and we've got DNA Force Plus is selling out. The ultimate thing you can do for your cells and your body.
[39:47.440 --> 39:52.440]  DNA Force Plus, check into it. So good for everybody, and that is discounted, even though it's about to sell out.
[39:52.440 --> 39:58.440]  DNA Force Plus at infowars.com.
[40:23.440 --> 40:29.440]  One year supplies, and it's the highest quality you're going to find, and it's just good to have that check box taken care of,
[40:29.440 --> 40:34.440]  and you know you're getting good food at a very good price, and you know that a small percentage of it, because there's not much profit in this,
[40:34.440 --> 40:40.440]  goes to us to fund our operation. So, prepare with Alex.com or infowars.com.
[40:40.440 --> 40:44.440]  You can find the preparedness section there, water filtration, air filtration. It's all there.
[40:44.440 --> 40:47.440]  The technocrats are getting ready to bring in all the Force GMO and more.
[40:47.440 --> 40:52.440]  It's time to start getting prepared. It starts with self-defense. It starts with being prepared. It starts with horrible food.
[40:52.440 --> 41:17.440]  It starts with digging in with a long, globalist fight. You'll win in the end.
[41:23.440 --> 41:31.440]  Hey, we've done mRNA vaccines to make our soldiers Superman. That's a way to make it sexy that, hey, we're experimenting on our troops.
[41:31.440 --> 41:38.440]  We'll send things with that into our troops, and thousands and thousands of die each time they try a new experimental vaccine.
[41:38.440 --> 41:42.440]  I've talked to high-level folks inside the federal government and the state of Texas health department.
[41:42.440 --> 41:46.440]  They say Alex, we know it hurts a lot of people, but it's for a greater good.
[41:46.440 --> 41:52.440]  But that's not even true, and it violates the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code, federal state law.
[41:52.440 --> 42:20.440]  This is violence being carried out against us by the military, and we have a right to resistance within each necessary.
[42:20.440 --> 42:29.440]  And hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned. That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[42:29.440 --> 42:40.440]  But Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail. But the new website is theresistance.video.
[42:40.440 --> 42:44.440]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[42:44.440 --> 42:50.440]  So the new URL that links right to banned.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries
[42:50.440 --> 42:55.440]  and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is at theresistance.video.
[42:55.440 --> 43:00.440]  Share the link. Theresistance.video. Theresistance.video.
[43:00.440 --> 43:05.440]  I've got some bad news. Our best-selling vitamin mineral fusion has sold out because people understand
[43:05.440 --> 43:10.440]  in these stressful times it's now more important than ever to boost your body's natural defenses.
[43:10.440 --> 43:16.440]  Here's the good news. Turmeric acts in very similar ways and is so good for inflammation,
[43:16.440 --> 43:20.440]  so good for your immune system, and we've got two great turmeric formulas.
[43:20.440 --> 43:26.440]  One is body's ultimate turmeric formula that is a dried turmeric extract, 95% of the humanoid.
[43:26.440 --> 43:31.440]  People love it. That's selling out. Despite that, it's still discounted and then for our store.com.
[43:31.440 --> 43:37.440]  And then also selling out this week is our liquid turmeric extract. It's called liquid turmeric extract.
[43:37.440 --> 43:41.440]  People really love it. It's extremely strong as well. It's selling out.
[43:41.440 --> 43:44.440]  And your purchase doesn't just help yourself and your body.
[43:44.440 --> 43:48.440]  It also funds the Info War and keeps us on air while they're trying to shut everybody down.
[43:48.440 --> 43:54.440]  So thank you all for your support. Please visit infowarstore.com and find so many other great items
[43:54.440 --> 43:58.440]  that will enrich yourself and your family's life and fund the Info War.
[43:58.440 --> 44:08.440]  God bless and good luck.
[44:29.440 --> 44:33.440]  Take over Russia starting in 1917, 1918.
[44:33.440 --> 44:39.440]  Starting Nazi Germany, it took Hitler about seven years to really start actually arresting people
[44:39.440 --> 44:44.440]  and even putting them in prison. Then in the next few years, he started murdering millions of people,
[44:44.440 --> 44:52.440]  Protestants, Jews, communists, basically Nazi party members that didn't do what he wanted.
[44:52.440 --> 44:55.440]  And there's the old saying, first they came for this group.
[44:55.440 --> 44:58.440]  I did nothing because I wasn't part of that group and they came for the next group
[44:58.440 --> 45:00.440]  and I wasn't part of that group so I did nothing.
[45:00.440 --> 45:03.440]  And finally when they came for me, there was nobody left to stand up for me.
[45:03.440 --> 45:08.440]  That was a famous Lutheran preacher that wrote that in one of those forced labor camps.
[45:08.440 --> 45:12.440]  You pull up the exact name. All of there by knows it's famous and historical.
[45:12.440 --> 45:15.440]  I'm just not giving the name because it slips me at the moment.
[45:15.440 --> 45:20.440]  And we're kind of in that point. There it is, Martin Niemoller.
[45:20.440 --> 45:23.440]  First they came for the Jews, but I did nothing because I'm not a Jew.
[45:23.440 --> 45:26.440]  I came for the socialists. I did nothing because I'm not a socialist.
[45:26.440 --> 45:29.440]  And they came to the Catholics, but I did nothing because I was not a Catholic.
[45:29.440 --> 45:34.440]  Finally they came for me, but then there was no one left to help me.
[45:34.440 --> 45:37.440]  And so everybody was like three years ago, oh, Jones, how is it?
[45:37.440 --> 45:40.440]  I'm lying about, you know, de-platforming and doing all this, do you?
[45:40.440 --> 45:45.440]  And I said, they're coming for you next.
[45:45.440 --> 45:48.440]  And there's this weird thing I've noticed, like whoever they hit first,
[45:48.440 --> 45:51.440]  I told my dad this three years ago, about a month before I got de-platformed.
[45:51.440 --> 45:53.440]  He came over to the house. He said, you're really pushing it.
[45:53.440 --> 45:56.440]  You're really pushing them. And I said, yeah, they're about to start the purge
[45:56.440 --> 45:58.440]  ahead of still in the election in three years from Trump.
[45:58.440 --> 46:00.440]  I want to be banned first. He goes, you want to be banned?
[46:00.440 --> 46:03.440]  I said, no, I don't want to be banned, but I'm not going to hold back
[46:03.440 --> 46:05.440]  because they're censoring and threatening us.
[46:05.440 --> 46:08.440]  And they had Facebook calling us and YouTube calling us. They were warning us.
[46:08.440 --> 46:12.440]  Just don't say this. Just don't do that. And you won't get banned.
[46:12.440 --> 46:17.440]  And we even recorded some of it. We never put it out.
[46:17.440 --> 46:21.440]  And I knew I said, no, so I didn't say stuff to get banned. I just was hardcore
[46:21.440 --> 46:25.440]  to be banned first because then you get all the benefit of being banned first.
[46:25.440 --> 46:27.440]  Nobody remembers everybody else that got banned.
[46:27.440 --> 46:31.440]  And there's this weird thing where they double round back to you at last.
[46:31.440 --> 46:34.440]  Historically, because history does repeat, doesn't just rhyme.
[46:34.440 --> 46:39.440]  It repeats just in a different people, different times, different technology.
[46:39.440 --> 46:45.440]  It's almost like you're a relic or a museum piece that you're the first.
[46:45.440 --> 46:50.440]  And so everybody remembers who got killed first.
[46:50.440 --> 46:53.440]  Kind of like the Holocaust. You know, they remember the main group.
[46:53.440 --> 46:55.440]  They went after first, but then everybody else that let it happen.
[46:55.440 --> 46:57.440]  Well, you don't remember them.
[46:57.440 --> 47:00.440]  So this is like a gut level spiritual thing I went with.
[47:00.440 --> 47:03.440]  It was the right thing to do. I'm not a Machiavelli,
[47:03.440 --> 47:07.440]  but the discernment and the knowledge is like a hundred times more Machiavelli
[47:07.440 --> 47:10.440]  than the Machiavellians, but it's organic.
[47:10.440 --> 47:13.440]  I don't need to describe a beautiful sunset or sunrise.
[47:13.440 --> 47:15.440]  I don't need to describe a beautiful woman.
[47:15.440 --> 47:19.440]  I don't need to describe an amazing vista and being in a forest
[47:19.440 --> 47:23.440]  and hearing the insects and the frogs and just that feeling of fulfillment.
[47:23.440 --> 47:25.440]  You felt it. You know it.
[47:25.440 --> 47:30.440]  And there's no literature or no expression that can take you there.
[47:30.440 --> 47:33.440]  You have to experience it yourself.
[47:33.440 --> 47:37.440]  And you have to experience beauty and you have to experience bad.
[47:37.440 --> 47:42.440]  That's why God gave you free will, the ultimate gift, the ultimate curse.
[47:42.440 --> 47:45.440]  And so here's Tucker Carlson laying out everything we've already said,
[47:45.440 --> 47:47.440]  but in his great way.
[47:47.440 --> 47:51.440]  And notice he talks about the Southern Poverty Law Center is running
[47:51.440 --> 47:53.440]  who is going to be purged. Well, let me show you.
[47:53.440 --> 47:55.440]  It's not about my horn. Overhead shot, please.
[47:55.440 --> 47:58.440]  A week ago.
[47:58.440 --> 48:02.440]  Over a week ago, I first reported from their own documents
[48:02.440 --> 48:06.440]  that they were saying they're going to have the Southern Poverty Law Center
[48:06.440 --> 48:08.440]  and ADL run who's put on list.
[48:08.440 --> 48:11.440]  Here's some of the headlines. Democrats call for more National Guard
[48:11.440 --> 48:14.440]  than the head of their illegal impeachment of Donald Trump.
[48:14.440 --> 48:18.440]  Democrat NGOs direct military CIA FBI in purge of conservatives.
[48:18.440 --> 48:21.440]  January 23rd.
[48:21.440 --> 48:23.440]  And now here's Tucker last night.
[48:23.440 --> 48:28.440]  Tucker dims mobilizing US military to put down domestic opinions.
[48:28.440 --> 48:31.440]  And that's why in poor wars is important because we root out
[48:31.440 --> 48:34.440]  and find the occurrence that grow out of the mighty trees.
[48:34.440 --> 48:36.440]  How to fix our domestic terrorism problem.
[48:36.440 --> 48:41.440]  And it's got CIA in here and the deputy in Homeland Security director
[48:41.440 --> 48:44.440]  saying we're going to route out quote all conservatives.
[48:44.440 --> 48:47.440]  And look at this chilling quote.
[48:47.440 --> 48:52.440]  We're going to route out and hunt down conservatives like we did Al Qaeda.
[48:52.440 --> 48:56.440]  So let's go ahead and go to part of the Tucker Carlson report.
[48:56.440 --> 48:57.440]  Here it is.
[48:57.440 --> 48:59.440]  We've done our best to bring you nightly updates on what's happening
[48:59.440 --> 49:02.440]  for the week and a half that Joe Biden has been president.
[49:02.440 --> 49:05.440]  But at times it's overwhelming. There's just too much to cover.
[49:05.440 --> 49:08.440]  The other day, for example, we learned that the Biden administration
[49:08.440 --> 49:13.440]  plans to make the tiny district of Columbia our 51st state,
[49:13.440 --> 49:16.440]  a more corrupt English speaking version of Monaco,
[49:16.440 --> 49:19.440]  as if lobbyists in Washington didn't have enough control over your life.
[49:19.440 --> 49:21.440]  Now they'll be US senators.
[49:21.440 --> 49:23.440]  But that's not even the biggest news.
[49:23.440 --> 49:26.440]  Just a few hours ago, Biden officials informed us
[49:26.440 --> 49:30.440]  that after almost 65 years of working to build a nuclear weapon,
[49:30.440 --> 49:33.440]  the nation of Iran may be finally, and you'll find this amazing,
[49:33.440 --> 49:36.440]  quote, just weeks away from getting a bomb.
[49:36.440 --> 49:40.440]  After 65 years of trying, what a coincidence.
[49:40.440 --> 49:42.440]  You already know how that story is going to end.
[49:42.440 --> 49:45.440]  Another pointless foreign war trillion spent.
[49:45.440 --> 49:46.440]  Many dead.
[49:46.440 --> 49:48.440]  The United States gaining nothing.
[49:48.440 --> 49:49.440]  We've seen that a lot.
[49:49.440 --> 49:50.440]  And it's happening again.
[49:50.440 --> 49:53.440]  Joe Biden just sent American troops to Syria.
[49:53.440 --> 49:55.440]  Well, you didn't know that?
[49:55.440 --> 49:56.440]  Yep.
[49:56.440 --> 49:58.440]  Hours after he became president,
[49:58.440 --> 50:01.440]  American soldiers crossed into the nation of Syria.
[50:01.440 --> 50:05.440]  And ending them to Syria was one of the first things Joe Biden did.
[50:05.440 --> 50:08.440]  Somehow most of the media forgot to even mention that.
[50:08.440 --> 50:11.440]  In their defense, as noted, there's a lot going on in the news,
[50:11.440 --> 50:13.440]  including a lot of troop mobilization.
[50:13.440 --> 50:16.440]  Syria's not the only place they're massing.
[50:16.440 --> 50:19.440]  Washington, D.C. looks like occupied Sarajevo tonight,
[50:19.440 --> 50:22.440]  a small city overflowing with soldiers.
[50:22.440 --> 50:25.440]  The troops came last month, tens of thousands of them.
[50:25.440 --> 50:27.440]  We were told they're going to protect the capital
[50:27.440 --> 50:29.440]  from the inevitable right wing violence
[50:29.440 --> 50:32.440]  and be certain to accompany Joe Biden's inauguration.
[50:32.440 --> 50:36.440]  Then Joe Biden was inaugurated and there wasn't any violence.
[50:36.440 --> 50:39.440]  Donald Trump didn't chain himself to North Portico.
[50:39.440 --> 50:41.440]  Trump voters didn't rush the stage.
[50:41.440 --> 50:44.440]  The Trump restoration never happened.
[50:44.440 --> 50:47.440]  And yet the troops stayed.
[50:47.440 --> 50:49.440]  No one in Congress seemed to notice,
[50:49.440 --> 50:52.440]  but in fact they're still arriving as of tonight, thousands of them.
[50:52.440 --> 50:53.440]  As of last Thursday,
[50:53.440 --> 50:57.440]  National Guard troops from 23 states were stationed in Washington
[50:57.440 --> 51:00.440]  and it seems to have risen over the past few days.
[51:00.440 --> 51:02.440]  We called the National Guard today to find out by how much,
[51:02.440 --> 51:04.440]  but they couldn't give us numbers or wouldn't.
[51:04.440 --> 51:07.440]  We do know that more states have sent troops since last week.
[51:07.440 --> 51:11.440]  You may have seen the video of soldiers getting off buses downtown near the capital.
[51:11.440 --> 51:13.440]  What are they all doing there?
[51:13.440 --> 51:16.440]  Again, National Guard leadership wouldn't tell us.
[51:16.440 --> 51:17.440]  Quote,
[51:17.440 --> 51:20.440]  For operational security reasons, the spokesman said,
[51:20.440 --> 51:24.440]  we will not get into specific details of the ongoing mission.
[51:24.440 --> 51:27.440]  Soldiers in our capital, but we don't have a right to know.
[51:27.440 --> 51:28.440]  Got it.
[51:28.440 --> 51:30.440]  J.V. Pritzker, who's the governor of Illinois,
[51:30.440 --> 51:31.440]  was not so shy about the purpose.
[51:31.440 --> 51:33.440]  He laid it out very clearly.
[51:33.440 --> 51:37.440]  In a press release announcing the deployment of more soldiers to Washington, D.C.,
[51:37.440 --> 51:39.440]  Pritzker explained that, quote,
[51:39.440 --> 51:42.440]  We must root out the dark forces of racism,
[51:42.440 --> 51:46.440]  white supremacy and disinformation that have created this moment.
[51:46.440 --> 51:48.440]  Let that sink in.
[51:48.440 --> 51:53.440]  The military has been deployed to Washington, D.C. to fight disinformation.
[51:53.440 --> 51:57.440]  So say something a Democratic governor doesn't like and he will send troops.
[51:57.440 --> 52:00.440]  Does that sound like the country that you grew up in?
[52:00.440 --> 52:01.440]  It probably doesn't.
[52:01.440 --> 52:03.440]  This is not the way things are done in America.
[52:03.440 --> 52:06.440]  It's not the way they have been done since the Civil War.
[52:06.440 --> 52:09.440]  No one alive has ever seen anything like this.
[52:09.440 --> 52:14.440]  So why is everyone, everyone pretending it's totally normal
[52:14.440 --> 52:18.440]  to have thousands of troops in the capital to fight disinformation?
[52:18.440 --> 52:20.440]  Well, because obviously they're in favor of it.
[52:20.440 --> 52:26.440]  They think it's fine to mobilize the army in order to put down domestic opinions.
[52:26.440 --> 52:31.440]  MSNBC, though, let us remind you an opinion channel is completely in favor of this.
[52:31.440 --> 52:32.440]  Watch.
[52:32.440 --> 52:37.440]  And now nearly 5,000 National Guard troops will be deployed in D.C. through March
[52:37.440 --> 52:40.440]  as some congressional staffers and extremism researchers say
[52:40.440 --> 52:45.440]  there are concerns about possible violence surrounding the upcoming impeachment proceedings.
[52:45.440 --> 52:50.440]  The National Guard will have to stay there as a symbol to those people who think
[52:50.440 --> 52:54.440]  that that building is vulnerable and that includes the American citizens
[52:54.440 --> 52:57.440]  who went up there and performed insurrection.
[52:57.440 --> 53:01.440]  Inside the Pentagon's decision to keep thousands of National Guard troops
[53:01.440 --> 53:06.440]  in the streets of Washington, D.C. as we get a new gut punch from the FBI
[53:06.440 --> 53:11.440]  affirming the greatest threat facing the American people is already among us.
[53:11.440 --> 53:14.440]  Oh, extremism researchers.
[53:14.440 --> 53:19.440]  So the Southern Poverty Law Center is now in charge of the Pentagon.
[53:19.440 --> 53:20.440]  You should know that.
[53:20.440 --> 53:22.440]  The whole thing's a gut punch, by the way, they just told you.
[53:22.440 --> 53:23.440]  Gut punch?
[53:23.440 --> 53:26.440]  Not that the people in charge have ordered up an unspecified number of soldiers
[53:26.440 --> 53:30.440]  for an unspecified period of time for purposes they refuse to explain to us.
[53:30.440 --> 53:31.440]  No, that's not a gut punch.
[53:31.440 --> 53:32.440]  It's not a big deal.
[53:32.440 --> 53:33.440]  It's business as usual here.
[53:33.440 --> 53:34.440]  All right.
[53:34.440 --> 53:36.440]  The full report is 30 minutes long.
[53:36.440 --> 53:37.440]  It's very powerful.
[53:37.440 --> 53:40.440]  It's on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[53:40.440 --> 53:43.440]  But notice the Pentagon has decided to keep troops there.
[53:43.440 --> 53:46.440]  Oh, and the CDC said, we're going to arrest you if you don't wear a mask,
[53:46.440 --> 53:48.440]  grabbing in a car or on a bus.
[53:48.440 --> 53:51.440]  They said, we are announcing our new authority.
[53:51.440 --> 53:54.440]  So it's just a bureaucracy and a giant, complete, total power grab.
[53:54.440 --> 53:58.440]  Because we put up with all the other TSA power grabs and the rest of it.
[53:58.440 --> 54:03.440]  The only place you can't have a border is the border where it's constitutional.
[54:03.440 --> 54:06.440]  So this is a mass looting you're about to witness.
[54:06.440 --> 54:09.440]  They're going to bring the country down, a depression, no doubt.
[54:09.440 --> 54:11.440]  And they're going to activate riots across the country.
[54:11.440 --> 54:14.440]  And we're going to go into a total communist takeover.
[54:14.440 --> 54:17.440]  And most men in America have been trained to submit,
[54:17.440 --> 54:19.440]  so it's going to get 1,000 times worse,
[54:19.440 --> 54:22.440]  until they have nothing left and finally fight back.
[54:22.440 --> 54:24.440]  Or we could just wake up and say no now.
[54:24.440 --> 54:25.440]  I mean, the nightmare's here.
[54:25.440 --> 54:26.440]  World government's here.
[54:26.440 --> 54:28.440]  It's all out in the open.
[54:28.440 --> 54:29.440]  All right.
[54:29.440 --> 54:31.440]  Hour number two and your phone calls are coming up.
[54:31.440 --> 54:32.440]  Knowledge is power.
[54:32.440 --> 54:34.440]  You know, we were supposed to be off the air by now, though.
[54:34.440 --> 54:35.440]  And Trump wanted a landslide.
[54:35.440 --> 54:37.440]  So they're doing all this because they're scared.
[54:37.440 --> 54:39.440]  They know they're on very tenuous ground.
[54:39.440 --> 54:42.440]  So don't follow what they say and don't do what they say.
[54:42.440 --> 54:44.440]  They're CHICOM agents and enemies.
[54:48.440 --> 54:50.440]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado.
[54:50.440 --> 54:51.440]  Thank you for holding.
[54:51.440 --> 54:52.440]  How are you doing, Alex?
[54:52.440 --> 54:54.440]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can.
[54:54.440 --> 54:55.440]  We're in such a critical time.
[54:55.440 --> 54:56.440]  Brother, how are you?
[54:56.440 --> 54:57.440]  I love you, man.
[54:57.440 --> 54:59.440]  I want to make a quick plug.
[54:59.440 --> 55:01.440]  That DNA force.
[55:01.440 --> 55:02.440]  I love it.
[55:02.440 --> 55:04.440]  I've been using it quite a while and I just went,
[55:04.440 --> 55:06.440]  looked at the ingredients again the other day
[55:06.440 --> 55:09.440]  and I see that it contains quercetin,
[55:09.440 --> 55:12.440]  which, according to some published studies
[55:12.440 --> 55:14.440]  that Dr. Merkula has cited,
[55:14.440 --> 55:18.440]  is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine
[55:18.440 --> 55:21.440]  and it helps channel the zinc into the cells.
[55:21.440 --> 55:24.440]  So people might want to take a look at that.
[55:24.440 --> 55:26.440]  All I know is with DNA force,
[55:26.440 --> 55:29.440]  we went out and looked at these high-end products
[55:29.440 --> 55:31.440]  that they sell through doctor clinics
[55:31.440 --> 55:32.440]  that aren't prescription,
[55:32.440 --> 55:34.440]  but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle
[55:34.440 --> 55:36.440]  because there's a lot of expensive product
[55:36.440 --> 55:38.440]  and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks.
[55:38.440 --> 55:41.440]  And so we basically cloned two different top brands together
[55:41.440 --> 55:42.440]  and that's what produced this.
[55:42.440 --> 55:43.440]  So thanks.
[55:43.440 --> 55:44.440]  Thanks for the plug.
[55:51.440 --> 55:52.440]  Anybody listening to my voice
[55:52.440 --> 55:54.440]  and simply searching in the term,
[55:54.440 --> 55:55.440]  Davos Group,
[55:55.440 --> 55:58.440]  Technocracy or Technocrats,
[55:58.440 --> 56:00.440]  you will get Klaus Schwab
[56:00.440 --> 56:02.440]  and Sean Claude Yunker
[56:02.440 --> 56:05.440]  and all the new world order globalists
[56:05.440 --> 56:07.440]  like Gigi Pink saying
[56:07.440 --> 56:10.440]  that they no longer want elected leaders over governments,
[56:10.440 --> 56:13.440]  that they want businessmen, technocrats over it.
[56:13.440 --> 56:14.440]  And that's who Klaus Schwab is.
[56:14.440 --> 56:16.440]  You might want to look into the guy
[56:16.440 --> 56:18.440]  that says they've launched the COVID-19 lockdowns
[56:18.440 --> 56:20.440]  to bankrupt you and make you poor.
[56:20.440 --> 56:23.440]  You might want to find out who this supervillain is.
[56:23.440 --> 56:26.440]  But you see, he believes because he's hidden it from playing you
[56:26.440 --> 56:28.440]  and you're not speaking out against it,
[56:28.440 --> 56:29.440]  that he has the right to do it to you.
[56:29.440 --> 56:31.440]  You might want to find out who he works for.
[56:31.440 --> 56:33.440]  He works directly for Prince Charles.
[56:33.440 --> 56:35.440]  He developed, since the 80s,
[56:35.440 --> 56:37.440]  the plan for global sustainability.
[56:37.440 --> 56:40.440]  That means worldwide NEO feudalists in his own works.
[56:40.440 --> 56:42.440]  So you might want to find out
[56:42.440 --> 56:44.440]  how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you
[56:44.440 --> 56:46.440]  before you take those shots.
[56:46.440 --> 56:48.440]  You might just want to find out who this villain is.
[56:48.440 --> 56:49.440]  All right.
[56:49.440 --> 56:52.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:20.440 --> 57:21.440]  You got it.
[57:28.440 --> 57:29.440]  All right.
[57:29.440 --> 57:30.440]  We're going to your phone calls here.
[57:30.440 --> 57:38.440]  Amber, Joe, Kirk, Duncan, Jeremy, Melissa, Misha,
[57:38.440 --> 57:42.440]  George, Judy, Misha.
[57:42.440 --> 57:44.440]  That's a cool name.
[57:44.440 --> 57:45.440]  We got a cat.
[57:45.440 --> 57:46.440]  His name's Peanut,
[57:46.440 --> 57:48.440]  but my three-year-old daughter calls it Misha.
[57:48.440 --> 57:49.440]  What does Misha mean?
[57:49.440 --> 57:50.440]  Is that Russian or something?
[57:50.440 --> 57:52.440]  Will, I'm not saying it's weird.
[57:52.440 --> 57:53.440]  I'm not saying your name's weird.
[57:53.440 --> 57:54.440]  I'm saying it's weird.
[57:54.440 --> 57:55.440]  I have a cat named Misha,
[57:55.440 --> 57:56.440]  and you're called in now, Misha.
[57:56.440 --> 57:59.440]  But we're taking your phone calls right now.
[57:59.440 --> 58:02.440]  I'm not going to recap what I'm covering.
[58:02.440 --> 58:03.440]  That's just, you know,
[58:03.440 --> 58:04.440]  Guder Donorong, War of the Gods,
[58:04.440 --> 58:05.440]  New World Order,
[58:05.440 --> 58:06.440]  World Government,
[58:06.440 --> 58:07.440]  Total Insanity.
[58:07.440 --> 58:08.440]  Amber in Arizona,
[58:08.440 --> 58:09.440]  you're on the air.
[58:09.440 --> 58:10.440]  Welcome.
[58:11.440 --> 58:12.440]  What up, brother?
[58:12.440 --> 58:13.440]  It's Amir.
[58:13.440 --> 58:14.440]  Amir, I'm sorry.
[58:14.440 --> 58:16.440]  See, I can't redo you these things.
[58:16.440 --> 58:18.440]  We spoke two months ago, brother,
[58:18.440 --> 58:19.440]  and you asked me what's going to happen
[58:19.440 --> 58:20.440]  in the next 54 days,
[58:20.440 --> 58:23.440]  and I told you military takeover
[58:23.440 --> 58:25.440]  and a mass awakening is going to happen.
[58:25.440 --> 58:26.440]  I remember you called,
[58:26.440 --> 58:27.440]  and here's what happened.
[58:27.440 --> 58:29.440]  About 47, my eyes went out.
[58:29.440 --> 58:30.440]  Yeah.
[58:30.440 --> 58:31.440]  And so my,
[58:31.440 --> 58:33.440]  I need to either get that screen closer
[58:33.440 --> 58:34.440]  or I need to get some glasses.
[58:34.440 --> 58:35.440]  In fact, I need to go to Optometrist,
[58:35.440 --> 58:36.440]  because they're still,
[58:36.440 --> 58:37.440]  Yeah, brother.
[58:37.440 --> 58:38.440]  You're all good.
[58:38.440 --> 58:39.440]  I remember you called.
[58:39.440 --> 58:41.440]  I mean, how long did you call, Amir?
[58:41.440 --> 58:42.440]  You called a few months ago?
[58:42.440 --> 58:43.440]  Yeah, in November.
[58:43.440 --> 58:44.440]  In November.
[58:44.440 --> 58:45.440]  So I remember you calling.
[58:45.440 --> 58:47.440]  So tell us, tell us what you predicted.
[58:47.440 --> 58:48.440]  Go ahead.
[58:48.440 --> 58:50.440]  I said that the military is going to take over
[58:50.440 --> 58:51.440]  and a mass awakening
[58:51.440 --> 58:53.440]  or the people is going to happen.
[58:53.440 --> 58:56.440]  The reason for that is the globalists,
[58:56.440 --> 58:58.440]  the time is up.
[58:58.440 --> 59:00.440]  The flies are over
[59:00.440 --> 59:02.440]  and people need to wake up.
[59:02.440 --> 59:04.440]  So let's go back to 1776.
[59:04.440 --> 59:06.440]  Why is it so great?
[59:06.440 --> 59:09.440]  That happened during the Air Force Confederation
[59:09.440 --> 59:13.440]  and when the Christians that left British
[59:13.440 --> 59:15.440]  so they can have a free life
[59:15.440 --> 59:17.440]  came out to America
[59:17.440 --> 59:20.440]  and they all had an agreement.
[59:20.440 --> 59:21.440]  I told you last time
[59:21.440 --> 59:22.440]  there's a remedy for everything
[59:22.440 --> 59:24.440]  that happens in the law.
[59:24.440 --> 59:26.440]  The master remedy is an article 6
[59:26.440 --> 59:29.440]  of the Constitution.
[59:29.440 --> 59:31.440]  I will like that.
[59:31.440 --> 59:32.440]  The constitutional lawyer Barnes
[59:32.440 --> 59:37.440]  to talk about that next time he comes on.
[59:37.440 --> 59:39.440]  Next thing that happened with the globalists,
[59:39.440 --> 59:40.440]  they wanted to take the land
[59:40.440 --> 59:42.440]  from the heirs of the land.
[59:42.440 --> 59:44.440]  They wanted to take it from the Christians
[59:44.440 --> 59:47.440]  and at the time they called them Morris.
[59:47.440 --> 59:50.440]  We call themselves Morris Americans now.
[59:50.440 --> 59:53.440]  The land was taken over.
[59:53.440 --> 59:57.440]  When the Act of 1871 happened
[59:57.440 --> 1:00:03.440]  to go around the original organic Constitution
[1:00:03.440 --> 1:00:05.440]  that was the first globalist takeover
[1:00:05.440 --> 1:00:08.440]  by the bankers.
[1:00:08.440 --> 1:00:10.440]  Now what's happening now
[1:00:10.440 --> 1:00:13.440]  is the final completion of it.
[1:00:13.440 --> 1:00:15.440]  They know that people are asleep.
[1:00:15.440 --> 1:00:16.440]  They know people are not educated
[1:00:16.440 --> 1:00:18.440]  and they know people don't know
[1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:23.440]  how to handle their affairs in law.
[1:00:23.440 --> 1:00:26.440]  The best thing to do is everybody
[1:00:26.440 --> 1:00:31.440]  download the 1828 Noah Webster Dictionary
[1:00:31.440 --> 1:00:34.440]  which is the very first English dictionary.
[1:00:34.440 --> 1:00:36.440]  Everybody download the Black's Law
[1:00:36.440 --> 1:00:38.440]  third and fourth edition.
[1:00:38.440 --> 1:00:40.440]  They download the globalists
[1:00:40.440 --> 1:00:43.440]  and all around the world they go off of.
[1:00:43.440 --> 1:00:46.440]  We need to teach ourselves civics again
[1:00:46.440 --> 1:00:48.440]  because as long as we don't know anything
[1:00:48.440 --> 1:00:51.440]  they can pull the wool over our eyes.
[1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:52.440]  They use Black's Law
[1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:54.440]  and now they're putting us into administrative law
[1:00:54.440 --> 1:00:56.440]  and UN law and so they have their own language
[1:00:56.440 --> 1:00:57.440]  and we don't even understand it
[1:00:57.440 --> 1:00:59.440]  and that's how they dominate us.
[1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:01.440]  We do understand it.
[1:01:01.440 --> 1:01:03.440]  They just put the ones behind bars.
[1:01:03.440 --> 1:01:04.440]  They do understand it
[1:01:04.440 --> 1:01:07.440]  so we don't wake the rest of the people up.
[1:01:07.440 --> 1:01:10.440]  They just make a fool of us
[1:01:10.440 --> 1:01:13.440]  and let go of what we're mostly saying to them.
[1:01:13.440 --> 1:01:35.440]  Our zdjęers,
[1:01:35.440 --> 1:01:41.360]  ring of Mordor, or the ring of Plato, you give it to somebody and it really enslaves
[1:01:41.360 --> 1:01:47.320]  them. It gives them power for a while, but it enslaves them. All right, Joe, Kirk Duncan,
[1:01:47.320 --> 1:01:52.200]  Jeremy, Chris, Esha, George, when pronouncing that right, Judy, and others, they're right
[1:01:52.200 --> 1:01:58.720]  backstage with us.
[1:01:58.720 --> 1:02:03.540]  There are almost no free independent media infrastructures in the United States, much
[1:02:03.540 --> 1:02:08.920]  less in the entire world. InfoWars is standalone with our own radio and TV satellite uplinks
[1:02:08.920 --> 1:02:14.840]  and hundreds of stations picking us up. Almost no one else has that, especially anybody covering
[1:02:14.840 --> 1:02:20.360]  real issues of global populism, the right to self-defense, and exposing the anti-human
[1:02:20.360 --> 1:02:25.720]  globalist death agenda. That's why when we go out and shoot videos, they're at Band-Aught
[1:02:25.720 --> 1:02:31.520]  Video. They're not allowed to be on Twitter, on YouTube, on Facebook. That's why it's
[1:02:31.520 --> 1:02:37.260]  so precious because censorship expands to everyone, which it is now, with AI monitoring
[1:02:37.260 --> 1:02:41.540]  and controlling what you can say and do. It's going to be the OACs, Black Band-Aught
[1:02:41.540 --> 1:02:45.980]  Video, and the now redesigned InfoWars.com that become more and more important, which
[1:02:45.980 --> 1:02:51.820]  they are. And the enemy is suing us, attacking us, hacking us, lying about us, sabotaging
[1:02:51.820 --> 1:02:56.340]  us, infiltrating us, trying to shut us down right now, because they're coming after everyone.
[1:02:56.340 --> 1:02:57.340]  So spread the word now.
[1:02:57.340 --> 1:03:04.340]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[1:03:27.340 --> 1:03:34.340]  Democrats are mobilizing the U.S. military to suppress domestic opinions. I have the
[1:03:36.780 --> 1:03:43.420]  former deputy director of the CIA now being rehired by Biden to run counter-terrorism
[1:03:43.420 --> 1:03:50.420]  in mainstream news covered it last week, saying, we are going to disrupt and attack conservatives.
[1:03:51.260 --> 1:03:55.820]  We're going to arrest them. We're going to come after them. That doesn't intimidate me.
[1:03:55.820 --> 1:04:02.820]  That really makes me scared for people like him, because they open that Pandora's box.
[1:04:03.020 --> 1:04:06.780]  But I understand they're real enemies of America, and they've got this existential desire to
[1:04:06.780 --> 1:04:10.620]  dominate and control it, so they can be a real boy. I mean, I get it. It's like they
[1:04:10.620 --> 1:04:13.860]  want a mount or a head on the wall. We're the big trophy. We're the big buck they want
[1:04:13.860 --> 1:04:17.060]  to get, and they just are foaming at the mount. They were all hired to be traitors and bring
[1:04:17.060 --> 1:04:21.860]  the country down, so they all have to hate the country to begin with to enjoy their work.
[1:04:21.860 --> 1:04:24.740]  And so now they know they stole the election. They know they're rejected. They're scared.
[1:04:24.740 --> 1:04:28.980]  They know they committed all these crimes, though they've put basically Skeletor in as
[1:04:28.980 --> 1:04:34.900]  the president. They hardly talk. A very badly functioning zombie, and so they don't know
[1:04:34.900 --> 1:04:41.740]  what to do. And so they go, let's just go with the template of absolute tyranny. Let's
[1:04:41.740 --> 1:04:46.900]  just take what is in the literature and in history and in fiction and in reality and
[1:04:46.900 --> 1:04:53.700]  in false reality and call every crazy inversion of justice reality. And so now here's the
[1:04:53.700 --> 1:04:57.780]  headline in FullWars.com. It's no joke. We have links to the New York Times article.
[1:04:57.780 --> 1:05:06.460]  New York Times calls for Biden to appoint realities are to fight misinformation. New York Times
[1:05:06.460 --> 1:05:12.380]  has amplified claims by experts Southern probably Law Center who are calling for Joe Biden to
[1:05:12.380 --> 1:05:17.500]  appoint a realities are that that's a quote. That's not a joke. Okay. The actual Ministry
[1:05:17.500 --> 1:05:23.420]  of Truth prompting critics to prepare the idea to the Ministry of Truth in George R. Wells
[1:05:23.420 --> 1:05:30.020]  1984, an article entitled how the Biden administration can help solve our reality crisis. There's
[1:05:30.020 --> 1:05:35.300]  no one believes them. The New York Times Kevin Rose sites experts who are calling on the
[1:05:35.300 --> 1:05:40.620]  Biden administration to put together a cross agency task force to tackle this information
[1:05:40.620 --> 1:05:49.260]  and domestic extremism, which would be led by something like a realities are. Oh my God.
[1:05:49.260 --> 1:05:54.060]  Uh, the so they can tell us that there aren't just two sexes and that a man, a biological
[1:05:54.060 --> 1:06:00.020]  man can have a baby. You mean stuff like that gaslighting. The job of the realities are would
[1:06:00.020 --> 1:06:04.940]  be to head up a centralized task force of the Southern probably Law Center ADL Democratic
[1:06:04.940 --> 1:06:13.100]  Party universities to coordinate a single strategic response war to things like COVID
[1:06:13.100 --> 1:06:17.980]  related and election fraud. So Oh, all these doctors come out and say that COVID's an overblown
[1:06:17.980 --> 1:06:22.420]  hoax. All these scientists to point out that we have the same number of deaths 2020 2019.
[1:06:22.420 --> 1:06:26.740]  Oh, the head scientist from all these places, they don't take the vaccine. Macron says it
[1:06:26.740 --> 1:06:31.500]  doesn't work. They need to stop it. Australia stopped the vaccine because it had HIV false
[1:06:31.500 --> 1:06:37.820]  positives. What they mean is, Oh, no, we are shoddy program so bad, we've got to have total
[1:06:37.820 --> 1:06:45.020]  unification of control for it to work. And Bill Gates is crawled out from under a rock
[1:06:45.020 --> 1:06:48.100]  wait till we play these new videos. I'll do it later. I want to go to your phone calls
[1:06:48.100 --> 1:06:58.460]  right now. Let's go to George in Connecticut. George, you're on the air. Welcome. Hi, Alex.
[1:06:58.460 --> 1:07:01.620]  Uh, yeah, I've been trying to get through to you a long time, but unfortunately some
[1:07:01.620 --> 1:07:08.020]  of the solutions I had would have been more appropriate before Trump ducked out. But one
[1:07:08.020 --> 1:07:16.940]  thing I think is still appropriate. We should support the disband the police unless they
[1:07:16.940 --> 1:07:24.740]  sign up to that they have a board of people, citizens of the county or city, depending
[1:07:24.740 --> 1:07:34.420]  on the situation, that they adhere to full constitutional, you know, loyalties and that
[1:07:34.420 --> 1:07:40.780]  they will not follow any unconscious constitutional rule. Let me stop. What you're saying is
[1:07:40.780 --> 1:07:45.340]  really good. I agree with it. But here's the issue. The globalists are coming in intimidating
[1:07:45.340 --> 1:07:50.420]  police attacking them the sound of their politics that any police mistakes or problems will
[1:07:50.420 --> 1:07:55.220]  be whitewash and covered up any problems that, uh, you know, can't be covered up. They'll
[1:07:55.220 --> 1:07:59.220]  just basically punt onto the federal government. You're always going to have problems. People
[1:07:59.220 --> 1:08:04.180]  are people. So they're creating fake police boards under strong cities initiative of the
[1:08:04.180 --> 1:08:08.740]  UN. They're actually globalists. We need to say, Hey, you need real police boards that
[1:08:08.740 --> 1:08:13.540]  are constitution boards that support good cops and help you stand up against bad cops
[1:08:13.540 --> 1:08:18.860]  and bad unions and really get the police because they're of the people working directly with
[1:08:18.860 --> 1:08:25.140]  the old communities. I totally agree with you. But how do you navigate that? We'd have
[1:08:25.140 --> 1:08:29.260]  to bring in experts that have dealt with this. And there are plenty of people out there that
[1:08:29.260 --> 1:08:35.220]  are real loyalists in the sense of to the constitution that are old military and intelligence
[1:08:35.220 --> 1:08:40.780]  people and people we know could will not turn on us or, or, or phony. But those are the
[1:08:40.780 --> 1:08:45.460]  type of people that should advise us. That's another key point. That's another key point.
[1:08:45.460 --> 1:08:51.700]  We're the loyal Americans. The, the, the, the, the, the globalists are the outside empire
[1:08:51.700 --> 1:08:56.020]  attacking us now, trying to overthrow the existence of our very republic. So when they
[1:08:56.020 --> 1:08:59.780]  say they're the resistance, no, they're not. They're the big global corporate power against
[1:08:59.780 --> 1:09:04.980]  our little soul country. And, and so we are the resistance.
[1:09:04.980 --> 1:09:11.460]  Another major point is that Camilla, a whole Harris or legs in the air Harris, is she really
[1:09:11.460 --> 1:09:18.980]  a natural born citizen? So her parents were not under a regular visa when she was born.
[1:09:18.980 --> 1:09:23.540]  So that she under the definition she is not, we should make an issue of that to the point
[1:09:23.540 --> 1:09:28.980]  where, where they know they can't hand off power to her whenever they can. But one of
[1:09:28.980 --> 1:09:33.420]  the, the more important points I want to make is that there are articles in the, in the
[1:09:33.420 --> 1:09:39.380]  constitution that basically established that this is a government of buy it off and buy
[1:09:39.380 --> 1:09:46.660]  the people. And she basically came out in the primaries. They erased that, that video
[1:09:46.660 --> 1:09:51.660]  that she said she's going to come after every Trump supporter, everybody that it doesn't
[1:09:51.660 --> 1:09:56.340]  support the Democrats. She said that on the video, you can't, I don't think you can pull
[1:09:56.340 --> 1:10:00.180]  up the video. Kamala Harris says she's coming after every Trump supporter when elected. She
[1:10:00.180 --> 1:10:04.220]  also said she'd ban all the guns. She also said Joe Biden's a racist. She actually said
[1:10:04.220 --> 1:10:10.300]  something true. But so is she God bless your brother. Great points. I agree. Biden's hiding.
[1:10:10.300 --> 1:10:14.420]  They're going to carry out this horribly un-American bankruptcy of the country. Once they launch
[1:10:14.420 --> 1:10:18.620]  the depression in the next year or two, then he will step down and she'll come in as the
[1:10:18.620 --> 1:10:22.580]  savior to fix it all. And that's definitely what they're doing. We need to start really
[1:10:22.580 --> 1:10:31.660]  going after her as the globalist operative that she is. Okay. Misha, in Chicago, then
[1:10:31.660 --> 1:10:34.180]  we'll go to Carlos. Misha, thanks for calling.
[1:10:34.180 --> 1:10:40.860]  Thank you, Alex. We, I'm calling on, you know, peaceful solutions to the issues at hand.
[1:10:40.860 --> 1:10:46.660]  And I think that, that the shorting in the dollar, the shorting in the silver and, and
[1:10:46.660 --> 1:10:53.020]  all the stuff happening on Reddit is, is really phenomenal. Ember, you talked about, um, uh,
[1:10:53.020 --> 1:10:58.620]  the movie, uh, THX 1183, you know, a long time ago, and I watched it, um, you know,
[1:10:58.620 --> 1:11:05.300]  a few months ago, the, the, the remake, the remastered version. And I think, you know,
[1:11:05.300 --> 1:11:08.060]  I think that's basically, you know, the future, right?
[1:11:08.060 --> 1:11:13.060]  Well, yeah, that was George Lucas made a student film and then made his first big film with
[1:11:13.060 --> 1:11:18.540]  George Lucas, uh, with Robert DeVall and others. Amazing film, but it's based on Brave New
[1:11:18.540 --> 1:11:23.580]  World, which was actually Huxley's real plan. So Huxley came and actually spoke, uh, to
[1:11:23.580 --> 1:11:28.380]  the same university that, uh, he even went to. Lucas did a few years before he died,
[1:11:28.380 --> 1:11:34.500]  uh, and a few years before Lucas was actually at the school. So he made a, a, a dystopic
[1:11:34.500 --> 1:11:40.180]  film about people bucking the Brave New World scenario, THX 1138. You're right. That is
[1:11:40.180 --> 1:11:43.860]  the actual, one of the actual plans for us.
[1:11:43.860 --> 1:11:48.860]  And at the end of the movie, um, if you recall when Robert DeVall was trying to escape, uh,
[1:11:48.860 --> 1:11:53.340]  the only reason they let him escape is because it started to cost too much. You know, so
[1:11:53.340 --> 1:11:57.780]  they say that he's gone over budget. Come back. It's too late. Come back. I'm over budget.
[1:11:57.780 --> 1:12:02.500]  Exactly. So we've got to make it too costly. Resistance overrides that, doesn't it?
[1:12:02.500 --> 1:12:07.500]  Yeah. And it's, it's not breaking windows. It's not, you know, you know, you know, conducting
[1:12:07.500 --> 1:12:10.780]  violence or doing anything like that. It's, it's hitting them, you know, where it hurts
[1:12:10.780 --> 1:12:15.300]  the most in the pocketbook. And, and, you know, and that's what's grabbing their attention.
[1:12:15.300 --> 1:12:19.180]  And it's insane that you have the former, you know, SDC chairman and, and, and all these
[1:12:19.180 --> 1:12:24.420]  other, um, you know, big wig, you know, money people going on and, and calling, calling again,
[1:12:24.420 --> 1:12:30.500]  just using the insane narrative, calling everybody racist or, or, or whatever.
[1:12:30.500 --> 1:12:35.460]  Don't hang up. We're going to come right back to you on the other side as you bring up THX
[1:12:35.460 --> 1:12:41.500]  1138. Uh, and then we're going to, uh, go to Carlos in Canada, always an amazing caller
[1:12:41.500 --> 1:12:48.540]  and so many others on this live February 2nd, 2021 transmission. Remember, every time
[1:12:48.540 --> 1:12:52.500]  you're listening, it could be our last show. That's not hyperbole. That's not high. This

[1:13:42.660 --> 1:13:46.140]  to have a perfect review unless literally everybody gives it five stars. So I mean,
[1:13:46.140 --> 1:13:49.540]  if you have 4.9, that's pretty much everybody gives it five stars. That may be one or two

[1:14:23.260 --> 1:14:27.460]  to find. And it's just good to have that check box taken care of. And you know, you're getting
[1:14:27.460 --> 1:14:31.100]  good food at a very good price. And you know that a small percentage of it because there's
[1:14:31.100 --> 1:14:36.380]  not much profit in this goes to us to fund our operation. So prepare with alex.com or
[1:14:36.380 --> 1:14:41.260]  info wars store.com. You can find the preparedness section there, water filtration, air filtration.
[1:14:41.260 --> 1:14:44.900]  It's all there. The technocrats are getting ready to bring in all the force GMO and more
[1:14:44.900 --> 1:14:48.300]  and more. It's time to start getting prepared. It starts with self defense. It starts with
[1:14:48.300 --> 1:14:52.300]  being prepared. It starts with horrible food. It starts with digging in with a long globalist
[1:14:52.300 --> 1:14:59.180]  fight. You'll win in the end.
[1:14:59.180 --> 1:15:19.380]  We're listening to the alex jones show since I was about three years old, I have memories
[1:15:19.380 --> 1:15:25.140]  of going to the cafeteria. There's a cafeteria all over the south and all over Texas started
[1:15:25.140 --> 1:15:31.620]  after World War II. And it's just a basic cafeteria. And it's the same food I ate there
[1:15:31.620 --> 1:15:36.220]  when I was a little kid. I can order the food ordered about once a week here to the office.
[1:15:36.220 --> 1:15:40.140]  It's like vegetables and cheese steak and just basic, you know, Southern cooking chicken
[1:15:40.140 --> 1:15:44.300]  fried steak sometimes, but I don't eat that a lot these days. Going out of business all
[1:15:44.300 --> 1:15:49.060]  over the state. It's the same fish, the same macaroni. It's the same thing I'm eating since
[1:15:49.060 --> 1:15:53.300]  I was a little kid. It's gone because the lockdown, not because they weren't successful
[1:15:53.300 --> 1:15:58.660]  at the company, but because of the lockdown, because they're not essential. And that's
[1:15:58.660 --> 1:16:03.660]  just an example of what it's like to have everything in America being shut down because
[1:16:03.660 --> 1:16:09.940]  it's not globalist. And so there's like one left in Austin and that's closing. So I was
[1:16:09.940 --> 1:16:13.420]  just in there eating it. I was thinking, my God, I've been eating this macaroni and cheese
[1:16:13.420 --> 1:16:18.180]  since I was a baby. I have memories of being like three years old eating this and it's
[1:16:18.180 --> 1:16:24.340]  gone. I can survive that, but they're going to try to take our guns now. House bill would
[1:16:24.340 --> 1:16:31.340]  require psych test retroactively for all gun owners, registration, license to own ammo,
[1:16:31.340 --> 1:16:37.300]  red flag law, no more second amendment. You're like, well, I just won't comply. Yeah. The
[1:16:37.300 --> 1:16:42.980]  war starts that way though. These people want a war. They're spoiling for a war. They want
[1:16:42.980 --> 1:16:46.700]  to conquer the country forever. You rejected them with Trump. You rejected them with info
[1:16:46.700 --> 1:16:54.380]  war. So now they're coming down with both feet. Governors and legislators and senators
[1:16:54.380 --> 1:16:58.420]  need to stand up now and say no to this illegal activity. My God, we're in martial law out
[1:16:58.420 --> 1:17:04.020]  in the open right now. We got to do it. Misha in Chicago, finish up your point about THX
[1:17:04.020 --> 1:17:05.020]  1138.
[1:17:05.020 --> 1:17:12.100]  Well, that was it is just nicking it more costly, you know, for the, you know, the hands
[1:17:12.100 --> 1:17:18.100]  of power, you know, and I think, you know, the whole surge on silver is a good thing,
[1:17:18.100 --> 1:17:23.540]  but I think there's going to be severe consequences on the dollar, right? Because I mean, I have
[1:17:23.540 --> 1:17:27.060]  Paul Schwab's book in front of me right now, you know, COVID-19, The Great Reset. I mean,
[1:17:27.060 --> 1:17:33.620]  he talks about the fate of the dollar and in the US against China and monetary policies
[1:17:33.620 --> 1:17:40.100]  and whatnot. And I think, you know, I think it's a blessing in disguise to get people
[1:17:40.100 --> 1:17:43.540]  into silver to protect their assets and their interests because they are going to collapse
[1:17:43.540 --> 1:17:46.740]  the dollar, right? They have three things that they need to do. They need to collapse
[1:17:46.740 --> 1:17:50.300]  the economy and they have to create a civil war. And I think those two are interchangeable,
[1:17:50.300 --> 1:17:53.900]  right? Because if they, if they, you know, cause a civil war, it's obviously going to
[1:17:53.900 --> 1:17:56.620]  lead to an economic collapse. Or if there's an economic collapse and they cause a civil
[1:17:56.620 --> 1:18:01.620]  war and obviously going to blame it on, on, on, on Russian agents and, and racist, right?
[1:18:01.620 --> 1:18:05.780]  Oh, they admit, I mean, they talk to us like they're animals. They love to do it. They're
[1:18:05.780 --> 1:18:09.220]  like, we're going to censor Alex Shilin and Tucker Carlson and take them out of here.
[1:18:09.220 --> 1:18:13.180]  But that's not censorship. And we're going to cut the carbon off to save the earth and
[1:18:13.180 --> 1:18:16.780]  the great research really for that. And COVID is not really a problem. Claude Schwab said
[1:18:16.780 --> 1:18:20.460]  that sort of Bill Gates, but a big bio weapons coming and it's going to kill most of you,
[1:18:20.460 --> 1:18:24.620]  but that's okay. Cause there's too many of you. They say all this and then Bill Gates
[1:18:24.620 --> 1:18:28.700]  bitches and says, why are you being so mean to me? Why are you attacking me? We've got
[1:18:28.700 --> 1:18:32.900]  new clips coming up later in the hour. What do you think the psychology is of that to
[1:18:32.900 --> 1:18:37.540]  announce they're doing it, then say they're not doing it? I guess it's just toying with
[1:18:37.540 --> 1:18:43.860]  us. It's a psychological technique. They've never been punched in the mouth. You know,
[1:18:43.860 --> 1:18:49.220]  they've never had to have real struggle. They've never had to, to, to, to, to live in reality.
[1:18:49.220 --> 1:18:53.460]  Right? I mean, they don't know you gave, if you gave the queen of English a toilet brush,
[1:18:53.460 --> 1:18:57.620]  you wouldn't know what to do with it. Right? They don't, they don't know what's going
[1:18:57.620 --> 1:19:01.260]  on. They don't know it's like that famous video of George Herbert Walker Bush a decade
[1:19:01.260 --> 1:19:05.580]  after scanners were ubiquitous. I know what a scanner was again. I was three years old
[1:19:05.580 --> 1:19:11.340]  at the grocery store. He's at like 1992 and doesn't know what a scanner is at a grocery
[1:19:11.340 --> 1:19:16.540]  store. Yeah, well, yeah, you had Bromphol as brand Bernanke or, you know, who, who does
[1:19:16.540 --> 1:19:20.100]  your grocery shopping? They don't get it. They don't, they don't, they don't know yet.
[1:19:20.100 --> 1:19:22.780]  That photo of Hillary Clinton when she went to someone's apartment in New York and they
[1:19:22.780 --> 1:19:26.780]  had a plant, you know, and they're in their sink or something. I mean, these, these people
[1:19:26.780 --> 1:19:30.740]  don't live in reality. They, they, they're, they're, they're high off their own, their
[1:19:30.740 --> 1:19:31.740]  own nonsense.
[1:19:31.740 --> 1:19:37.300]  So a big study came out last week, a big university study that big tech people, even worse than
[1:19:37.300 --> 1:19:43.340]  royalty, don't live in the real world and live such a cloistered lifestyle that they're
[1:19:43.340 --> 1:19:46.140]  another species or another class.
[1:19:46.140 --> 1:19:53.980]  Yeah. I mean, yeah, it just, it's, you know, I don't know what else to say on that. I mean,
[1:19:53.980 --> 1:19:57.940]  they, I mean, they, they, they think, you know, obviously they're better. Well, you know,
[1:19:57.940 --> 1:20:02.460]  I remember I've been listening to you for about 15 years and I, and I've been saying,
[1:20:02.460 --> 1:20:07.460]  you know, you know, the, you know, the info war is real, right? And it is effective, right?
[1:20:07.460 --> 1:20:12.700]  It's all long term, right? And I've had people who would last in my space, who would ridicule
[1:20:12.700 --> 1:20:17.940]  me, who would tell me off family and friends and whatnot. And now they're calling me saying,
[1:20:17.940 --> 1:20:21.620]  Hey, you've been right, right? Cause cause we, cause we, you know, I listened to you
[1:20:21.620 --> 1:20:28.060]  for this long. And I mean, you know, you know, you know, uh, you know, uh, uh, it was an
[1:20:28.060 --> 1:20:35.540]  E Howard Griffin, uh, his books, if you go on Amazon on, on, on, on, on there and a section
[1:20:35.540 --> 1:20:40.060]  of, uh, uh, uh, uh, books on economy, you go to all their subsections to his books are
[1:20:40.060 --> 1:20:42.220]  in the top five being, being sold, right?
[1:20:42.220 --> 1:20:44.900]  Oh, let's expand on that. And I'm going to go right and take more calls, but you're
[1:20:44.900 --> 1:20:49.140]  really bringing up some central points here. It's like the political reporter. It's an
[1:20:49.140 --> 1:20:56.140]  article on M4s.com panics says Trump base getting stronger since he left. Well, I mean,
[1:20:56.140 --> 1:21:01.820]  I can tell you, we had a huge audience, but people didn't take it serious, a lot of them.
[1:21:01.820 --> 1:21:06.540]  But now we have a bigger hardcore audience ever being persecuted. So of course them stealing
[1:21:06.540 --> 1:21:11.100]  the election from Trump and put persecuting him and trying to put him in jail is going
[1:21:11.100 --> 1:21:16.060]  to make him more popular. I mean, don't they see tyrants only think one step at a time.
[1:21:16.060 --> 1:21:18.660]  And that's why they always get annihilated.
[1:21:18.660 --> 1:21:22.300]  You had, you had the, you bring in Brzezinski years ago before he died, talked about a mass
[1:21:22.300 --> 1:21:26.420]  awakening, right? And he said the mass awakening is coming and it'll be easier to kill everyone
[1:21:26.420 --> 1:21:31.340]  than convince him. And, and, and his book, uh, Technicronica era, right? I mean, there's,
[1:21:31.340 --> 1:21:35.260]  there's terrifying things in that. He talks about psychotronic weapons and all these things.
[1:21:35.260 --> 1:21:39.740]  So, so there is a full spectrum war happening on all of us, right? It's not. Oh, DARPA admits
[1:21:39.740 --> 1:21:44.380]  the cell towers can be activated as weapons to control emotions. That was, uh, declassified
[1:21:44.380 --> 1:21:48.780]  in 1999. Look at this political reporter, panic, Trump base getting stronger since he
[1:21:48.780 --> 1:21:55.300]  left. And then this McConnell calls GOP representative Marjorie Taylor green, a cancer for the Republican
[1:21:55.300 --> 1:22:03.260]  party because she won by 75% the biggest margin of any national candidate. So, so think about
[1:22:03.260 --> 1:22:04.260]  that.
[1:22:04.260 --> 1:22:10.020]  Winning is what threatens them. He means the establishment Republican party, not, not the
[1:22:10.020 --> 1:22:11.940]  real one.
[1:22:11.940 --> 1:22:16.020]  We all knew this was coming out. Who, who were the number? What was the number one threat
[1:22:16.020 --> 1:22:20.860]  in the Obama administration, right? Who, who was, who were they most afraid of? It was
[1:22:20.860 --> 1:22:26.580]  the American people returning veteran. Yes. Remember all they were always demonizing veterans
[1:22:26.580 --> 1:22:31.500]  and all those TV shows like Homeland where veterans are terrorist, but the first four
[1:22:31.500 --> 1:22:35.060]  or five seasons of Homeland, it was veterans were bad. Then the last few seasons it was
[1:22:35.060 --> 1:22:40.420]  Alex Jones was the bad guy. Yeah. Do you remember in the Mayak report, right? The, the, the,
[1:22:40.420 --> 1:22:45.100]  the don't fret on me flag, the, the America of freedom to fascism documented was listed
[1:22:45.100 --> 1:22:50.420]  as, as terrorist documents, um, uh, more on lobby and you get that Congress woman wearing
[1:22:50.420 --> 1:22:53.100]  more on lobby, uh, a mask on her face.
[1:22:53.100 --> 1:22:56.980]  No, I agree. They're in total panic mode. They've stolen things. They're in a war to
[1:22:56.980 --> 1:23:00.620]  collapse us. They're owned by China. They're being there. Here's the thing. They're scared
[1:23:00.620 --> 1:23:03.780]  because they're slaves. They're told by the EU. They're told by the big banks. They're
[1:23:03.780 --> 1:23:08.140]  told by China what to do. They put swallows well on the intelligence committee when he's
[1:23:08.140 --> 1:23:13.660]  admitted Chinese spy. They are just going for broke to normalize treason and it's not
[1:23:13.660 --> 1:23:14.660]  going to work. God bless you.
[1:23:14.660 --> 1:23:18.340]  All right. We're going to go to break and Carlos is always a great caller. I'm going
[1:23:18.340 --> 1:23:23.300]  to go to him. I recognize regular caller Carlos who's, you know, basically worked on the inside
[1:23:23.300 --> 1:23:26.900]  and then we're going to go to everybody else in the order that we've received your calls
[1:23:26.900 --> 1:23:32.500]  and then two days in a row, because I got so many questions for him. Robert Barnes joins
[1:23:32.500 --> 1:23:40.060]  us in the third hour today and then Paul, Joseph Watson. We've got new t-shirts, F Biden, F
[1:23:40.060 --> 1:23:44.980]  tyranny, and of course, F mask. Hey, it's a little crass. This is the time of that type
[1:23:44.980 --> 1:23:48.500]  of behavior. Wars aren't one with powder puffs or gloves.
[1:23:48.500 --> 1:24:00.500]  You must guard your humanity. You must guard your children's humanity. You must guard the
[1:24:00.500 --> 1:24:05.100]  very genetic code of the planet. The globalists have set themselves up as the guardians of
[1:24:05.100 --> 1:24:09.540]  this world, but they are the ones that are overriding every genetic system and poisoning
[1:24:09.540 --> 1:24:15.540]  the planet. They are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human
[1:24:15.540 --> 1:24:21.660]  on earth to the GMO crops. And now they've moved on to their main target, humanity with
[1:24:21.660 --> 1:24:29.180]  the mRNA vaccines, which are not vaccines. They are recombinant DNA from aborted cloned
[1:24:29.180 --> 1:24:36.860]  fetuses were then inserted into your genome to take over your body's systems. Go read
[1:24:36.860 --> 1:24:43.980]  the actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines and then remember you've been warned. This
[1:24:43.980 --> 1:24:47.860]  is the equivalent of an alien takeover. Whether it's interdimensional, whether it's little
[1:24:47.860 --> 1:24:52.060]  green men, the globalists are acting like another species that's overtaking us and overriding
[1:24:52.060 --> 1:24:55.700]  us. It's all the same in the end.
[1:24:55.700 --> 1:25:00.180]  President Trump won in a landslide on November 3rd, but the globalists weren't going to let
[1:25:00.180 --> 1:25:06.060]  that happen. They had to have some way to repudiate the populist movement, emanating
[1:25:06.060 --> 1:25:11.940]  from the United States that spread across the world from the UK to Brazil. They were
[1:25:11.940 --> 1:25:16.820]  desperate. They admitted their own publications. They didn't know what to do. And so they put
[1:25:16.820 --> 1:25:22.780]  out 80 million fake ballots, violated state law, and stole it better than dollars. And
[1:25:22.780 --> 1:25:26.620]  now they're coming after the president. They're coming after you. They're coming after me.
[1:25:26.620 --> 1:25:30.820]  They're shutting everybody off the internet. They're trying to totally censor us. And that's
[1:25:30.820 --> 1:25:35.260]  why M4 Wars is still in the fight because we knew this was coming. We told you this
[1:25:35.260 --> 1:25:39.580]  was coming. We were the first main target that we're still on air at m4wars.com and

[1:26:57.220 --> 1:27:22.220]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:22.220 --> 1:27:38.860]  I can't drive. 55. Her example of people saying I'm not going to follow this law, so they
[1:27:38.860 --> 1:27:46.460]  changed it. It's a human planet, four people, five people. We're not building a post human
[1:27:46.460 --> 1:27:53.580]  future. We're building a post globalist future. And their attempt and their big gamble for
[1:27:53.580 --> 1:28:00.580]  total control is going to blow up in their dirty new world order you Genesis faces.
[1:28:00.580 --> 1:28:04.860]  So here's where we are. You have these mega banks that have created thousands of times
[1:28:04.860 --> 1:28:09.780]  fraudulent money for what there is real assets in the world. They've leveraged that fraud
[1:28:09.780 --> 1:28:13.660]  because we accept it to buy up everything. They see the earth is theirs and they want
[1:28:13.660 --> 1:28:18.900]  to cut resources off and bankrupt all their physical competition because they want total
[1:28:18.900 --> 1:28:24.140]  control over the individual and your lifestyle and your body and your reproductive system.
[1:28:24.140 --> 1:28:28.340]  They want to play God. Corporations want to make you a commodity. And that's what the
[1:28:28.340 --> 1:28:33.660]  great reset is. And we have to have Congress and legislatures and governors and people
[1:28:33.660 --> 1:28:41.300]  and churches and authors and society say no. We see what it is. We reject it. But the
[1:28:41.300 --> 1:28:46.620]  psychologists that came up with this plan know you like to be a hero. Wear your mask
[1:28:46.620 --> 1:28:52.300]  because you're a hero. Don't go outside. You're a hero. Be not essential. You're a hero.
[1:28:52.300 --> 1:28:56.540]  Well they teach you to collapse and be serfs. They're simply making you poor to control you.
[1:28:56.540 --> 1:29:01.820]  It's called slavery. It's called serfdom. It's called feudalism. Joining us is Carlos
[1:29:01.820 --> 1:29:07.100]  in Canada by administration quickly moving towards tyranny. He told the fellow that
[1:29:07.100 --> 1:29:10.820]  answered the phone. Carlos, what in the hell is going on? What do you expect to happen
[1:29:10.820 --> 1:29:14.940]  next? Because the globalists are moving fast. I think because they're scared of something.
[1:29:14.940 --> 1:29:21.060]  What do you think? Well, I think they are scared, Alex. But the important thing to keep
[1:29:21.060 --> 1:29:27.860]  in mind is that where there has been loss in a battle, there's also creation of opportunity.
[1:29:27.860 --> 1:29:32.660]  Sure you have to stop and pick up your casualties. Sure you have to start counting who's left
[1:29:32.660 --> 1:29:38.380]  and what assets you have to defend what you believe in. But let me tell you at the same
[1:29:38.380 --> 1:29:46.860]  time the opportunity has risen. We saw over a period of time how infowars has been an
[1:29:46.860 --> 1:29:51.500]  instrument of education. And I have always committed myself to the little time that
[1:29:51.500 --> 1:29:55.980]  I have on your program to educate. You know, when I said, oh, here we have a president
[1:29:55.980 --> 1:30:01.100]  that has the presidency, the Congress, the Senate. He has Jackson on the wall, Jefferson
[1:30:01.100 --> 1:30:05.820]  on the other wall, and Washington in the front of it. The office is in good hands. This
[1:30:05.820 --> 1:30:10.540]  man is good judgment. Well, you know, he does have good judgment. But he was a businessman
[1:30:10.540 --> 1:30:16.300]  who didn't know that as he did not read, he would have read, he would have learned, he
[1:30:16.300 --> 1:30:23.500]  would have seen that in, let's say, 1909, the Tsar of Russia, because there were revolution
[1:30:23.500 --> 1:30:30.820]  in the making, transferred $400 million worth of, you know, it's money from the Treasury,
[1:30:30.820 --> 1:30:37.300]  just in case something were to be needed for an emergency deposited in American banks,
[1:30:37.300 --> 1:30:46.940]  you know, Warburgs, you know, that the people. So the bankers took the money. Oh, in 2017,
[1:30:46.940 --> 1:30:56.220]  right, he was demolished, Russia was totally changed. In 2013, sorry, in my apologies,
[1:30:56.220 --> 1:31:04.060]  in 1913, the Federal Reserve was founded from the money that the bankers took from the Tsar
[1:31:04.060 --> 1:31:10.820]  of Russia. This you will see in just those moments. Why? We know that because the Tsarina,
[1:31:10.820 --> 1:31:19.100]  the Tsar's mother, sued to recover the funds. Now, when you look at who is running the country
[1:31:19.100 --> 1:31:24.100]  and why the financial system in America is doing what they're doing, you have to wonder
[1:31:24.100 --> 1:31:31.420]  where we go next. I agree with you. I mean, the globalists
[1:31:31.420 --> 1:31:36.220]  are making their move. The AOCs, the Bidens or puppets, but the power structure behind
[1:31:36.220 --> 1:31:41.100]  it, Allied with China and others, are just bringing in policies that will devastate things
[1:31:41.100 --> 1:31:45.780]  on record, creating incredible resistance. And now they're just going to try to label
[1:31:45.780 --> 1:31:51.100]  that terrorist and try to have the CIA silence everyone. That's not going to go well. They're
[1:31:51.100 --> 1:31:55.460]  not going to go well at all. But you see, ask yourself the questions because the people
[1:31:55.460 --> 1:32:00.540]  like the average person in the street can never believe his government is turning against
[1:32:00.540 --> 1:32:06.740]  them. I mean, you finance the government. There was one taxation without representation
[1:32:06.740 --> 1:32:14.260]  was a very important principle. It led to 1776. But now you have government turning against
[1:32:14.260 --> 1:32:19.900]  you, borrowing trillions of dollars. And you have no control over that. That's taxation
[1:32:19.900 --> 1:32:25.620]  without representation, either ever another form of it. 500. No, I know, but big picture
[1:32:25.620 --> 1:32:30.660]  here, the globalists are putting the US into an exploitation phase, like communist do collapsing
[1:32:30.660 --> 1:32:35.220]  us and using us to take over the next nation. Clearly we're slated for destruction. How
[1:32:35.220 --> 1:32:38.540]  fast do you think this is going to move? And what should people do to stop it? Because
[1:32:38.540 --> 1:32:43.860]  we are just we are in total peril right now. Well, right now there are solutions. There
[1:32:43.860 --> 1:32:47.860]  were solutions when the president of the United States was Donald Trump with the Congress
[1:32:47.860 --> 1:32:52.860]  and the Senate, but he didn't know the solutions. We talked about the solutions, you know, repatriate
[1:32:52.860 --> 1:32:57.540]  the treasury. Imagine the person that was running the Federal Reserve is now running
[1:32:57.540 --> 1:33:04.300]  the treasury of the United States. Can you believe that? We're in so much trouble that
[1:33:04.300 --> 1:33:10.180]  the only solutions that are left are for us to understand the fundamental principles.
[1:33:10.180 --> 1:33:16.620]  Ask yourself, is Russia first taking care of Russia first? Yes, Russia is taking care
[1:33:16.620 --> 1:33:20.900]  of Russia first. Yeah, Biden said, he said, I don't like America first. Well, then who
[1:33:20.900 --> 1:33:24.860]  is first? Because there's always something first. They're telling your wife, you're not
[1:33:24.860 --> 1:33:29.300]  the first in my life, or your children, you're not first in my life. Well, who is then just
[1:33:29.300 --> 1:33:34.900]  outrageous that they would talk to us directly like this. Exactly. China, the same thing.
[1:33:34.900 --> 1:33:39.980]  China first. Okay, they're looking out to themselves. Who are the globalists then? Well, they're
[1:33:39.980 --> 1:33:45.020]  in your home. They're inside here in the United States. They're the ones that are this. They
[1:33:45.020 --> 1:33:49.340]  are the globalists destroying you. What you have to do is to decide, are we going to be
[1:33:49.340 --> 1:33:56.060]  a human race or a robot race? This is what Catherine Austin Fitz made it very, very clear.
[1:33:56.060 --> 1:33:59.620]  And this is where you have to start thinking of the fundamentals. Fundamentals are, I'm
[1:33:59.620 --> 1:34:05.660]  a human being, and I want my politicians to make sure that I as a human being have representation.
[1:34:05.660 --> 1:34:09.980]  Well, that's right. The social contract has been cut. Thank you so much for the call,
[1:34:09.980 --> 1:34:14.220]  Carlos. You're talking about the film that's coming out. They're already put like a 45
[1:34:14.220 --> 1:34:20.020]  minute raw cut of her target. It's very powerful. And it's, what's the exact title? It's on
[1:34:20.020 --> 1:34:25.820]  band.video. I aired it Saturday. A special show I did. It's Planet Lockdown. Planet
[1:34:25.820 --> 1:34:32.300]  Lockdown. Very powerful. It's free at band.video. Hope you go and check it out. All right. Who's
[1:34:32.300 --> 1:34:39.100]  been holding longest here? That would be Jeremy and then Duncan and then Judy and Joe and
[1:34:39.100 --> 1:34:43.540]  everybody else. We're going to get to you when we come back and start the next segment
[1:34:43.540 --> 1:34:48.180]  for a couple of segments. There it is. Planet Lockdown. Band.video. Planet Lockdown. Full
[1:34:48.180 --> 1:34:57.060]  censored film. 285,000 views. She's the former deputy head of HUD. Very well respected. And
[1:34:57.060 --> 1:35:01.140]  she managed companies with 40 something million dollars on them. YouTube has banned it more
[1:35:01.140 --> 1:35:06.140]  than 10 times. Think about that. She's just up there talking about the great reset and
[1:35:06.140 --> 1:35:10.980]  what it's doing and showing proof and oh, sorry, you can't talk because you were the
[1:35:10.980 --> 1:35:14.860]  deputy head of HUD under the Clintons. And she's a liberal, but she's not a psychotic
[1:35:14.860 --> 1:35:18.580]  demon and she cares about what's happening and she's speaking up. So this is a very
[1:35:18.580 --> 1:35:23.780]  important piece. And you know, she'd have 10 million views, but it has a little over
[1:35:23.780 --> 1:35:27.780]  a quarter million. And I just wanted to get out to everybody. It's so precious. It's
[1:35:27.780 --> 1:35:33.900]  so important. You never know if we'll be here next week. Separately speaking of that, we
[1:35:33.900 --> 1:35:39.660]  have new t-shirts in. We have actually six different designs. We have humans are essential.

[1:37:47.740 --> 1:38:15.500]  And that's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is. You see the headlines
[1:38:15.500 --> 1:38:20.500]  from CNN, ABC News, doctors say it's worse than they ever thought. COVID more devastating
[1:38:20.500 --> 1:38:25.740]  they could ever imagine. They told us that two and a half million people would be dead
[1:38:25.740 --> 1:38:31.180]  just eight months ago within three months. Okay? It's a quarter million if you count
[1:38:31.180 --> 1:38:36.340]  all of the people that died of other things. We're talking 96% at comorbidity. These are
[1:38:36.340 --> 1:38:40.180]  real numbers. These are real facts. This is the chicken little event where we all run
[1:38:40.180 --> 1:38:44.340]  our houses, never come out and are taught we're not essential. All the big box stores
[1:38:44.340 --> 1:38:50.020]  on Amazon take over the planet. You could stand up against it. This is slavery. It is
[1:38:50.020 --> 1:38:55.620]  not something you can put up with and survive.
[1:38:55.620 --> 1:39:01.340]  Info wars is a archetypal classic example of free independent organic resistance against
[1:39:01.340 --> 1:39:07.860]  tyranny. You built info wars. You spread the word. You prayed for us. You bought the products.
[1:39:07.860 --> 1:39:13.220]  You called in. You made recommendations. Info wars is as much yours as it is mine. And that's
[1:39:13.220 --> 1:39:18.180]  why the enemy is so upset that under the deep platforming, under all the DNC lawsuits, under
[1:39:18.180 --> 1:39:23.660]  all the attack, in many ways, we become stronger with band.video, redesigned info wars with
[1:39:23.660 --> 1:39:31.140]  all of our great crew with documentary films and 10 hours of live radio and TV a day. We
[1:39:31.140 --> 1:39:36.060]  are the resistance. You are the resistance. So remember this arsenal of freedom is waiting
[1:39:36.060 --> 1:39:41.500]  for you to continue to spread the word about it and to continue for you to support because
[1:39:41.500 --> 1:39:45.340]  this is something we built together. It's not just a national treasure. It's a treasure
[1:39:45.340 --> 1:39:49.620]  worldwide against the tyrants and they know it and they can't stand it. And it's everything
[1:39:49.620 --> 1:39:54.540]  we talked about comes true. Our credibility only goes up together. So I salute you all.
[1:39:54.540 --> 1:39:58.660]  I've got some bad news. Our best selling vitamin mineral fusion has sold out because people
[1:39:58.660 --> 1:40:02.580]  understand in these stressful times, it's now more important than ever to boost your

[1:40:08.620 --> 1:40:12.900]  is so good for inflammation, so good for your immune system. And we've got two great
[1:40:12.900 --> 1:40:18.540]  turmeric formulas. One is body's ultimate turmeric formula that is a dried turmeric extract

[1:40:24.060 --> 1:40:29.580]  them for our store.com. And then also selling out this week is our liquid turmeric extract
[1:40:29.580 --> 1:40:34.540]  is called liquid turmeric extract. People really love it. It's extremely strong as well. It's

[1:41:18.420 --> 1:41:36.660]  So now they're just trying to start a fight with the American people and say we're all
[1:41:36.660 --> 1:41:42.340]  Donald Trump. Horside Karen kicked out of NBA game at her LeBron James allegedly called
[1:41:42.340 --> 1:41:52.940]  her a bitch. So much insanity. We're taking your phone calls right now. Who has been holding
[1:41:52.940 --> 1:42:04.140]  the longest? That would be Jeremy in Texas. Thanks for calling. Go ahead. Alex. Yes, sir.
[1:42:04.140 --> 1:42:08.780]  About an hour, sir. That's how long I held and the reason you're here. We appreciate
[1:42:08.780 --> 1:42:13.020]  you. Go ahead. Hey, man, it's an absolute honor to be honest with you. Got chill bumps
[1:42:13.020 --> 1:42:18.460]  right now. But I want people to hear what I had to say. That's one of the reasons I
[1:42:18.460 --> 1:42:24.100]  stayed on hold for so long. Alex, I'm a normal guy. Grew up in Calhoun County, Alabama,
[1:42:24.100 --> 1:42:30.700]  man. I worked at a place that National Geographic actually did a show about it. They built
[1:42:30.700 --> 1:42:40.540]  M1 Abram Tanks, okay? Close to the old Fort McClellan base that once was the military
[1:42:40.540 --> 1:42:47.860]  police school for the army. And I believe all of the uniform services. I'm a normal
[1:42:47.860 --> 1:42:55.020]  guy. No war hero. I'm no political expert. I am a trucker. Okay. I've been hauling produce
[1:42:55.020 --> 1:43:04.340]  off the West Coast since this whole COVID deal started, right? About 5,000 miles a week.
[1:43:04.340 --> 1:43:12.900]  And I want your listeners and new listeners, especially to know that the government, they
[1:43:12.900 --> 1:43:18.180]  have a lot more power than the average American gives them credit for. You've said it many
[1:43:18.180 --> 1:43:25.100]  times, man. You know, I'm going to tell you a quick story. San Antonio, Texas, there is
[1:43:25.100 --> 1:43:33.420]  a government installation that me and a few other DOD civilians actually did a little
[1:43:33.420 --> 1:43:40.060]  tour about four months. We couldn't take our cell phones in. This base was blacked out
[1:43:40.060 --> 1:43:45.300]  from aerial, you know, Google Maps, Google Earth, whatever you want to call it. And this
[1:43:45.300 --> 1:43:50.780]  was in 2010. And what we were actually doing, me and some of the other civilians that worked
[1:43:50.780 --> 1:44:01.780]  with the DOD, 401st, AFSB, we was test firing, cleaning and repackaging up blocks and AK-47,
[1:44:01.780 --> 1:44:08.820]  okay? Which, you know, I'm a veteran and that kind of seemed kind of strange to me that
[1:44:08.820 --> 1:44:17.060]  I mean, these massive amounts of weapons, okay, that were going out of this government
[1:44:17.060 --> 1:44:22.740]  installation. And, you know, it's weapons that, you know, the majority of AK-47s kill
[1:44:22.740 --> 1:44:25.260]  American soldiers. Would you agree, Alex?
[1:44:25.260 --> 1:44:28.860]  Yes. I mean, did you know where they were being sent? Because this has come out a lot.
[1:44:28.860 --> 1:44:34.300]  The Chinese have been caught shipping them in. That's even come out in the news. Where
[1:44:34.300 --> 1:44:36.580]  did you think they were being distributed?
[1:44:36.580 --> 1:44:42.220]  I'll put it to you like this. Fastened the furious with Clinton and the Obama administration.
[1:44:42.220 --> 1:44:46.740]  Oh yeah, they got caught shipping them to Mexico to be sent to Al Qaeda.
[1:44:46.740 --> 1:44:52.060]  Very short thereafter this. And the ones, and I will say this, Alex, the ones that started
[1:44:52.060 --> 1:44:58.300]  asking questions like myself, Alex, I've never told this story before. Ever. You're the first
[1:44:58.300 --> 1:45:02.820]  person. I actually reached out to you three years ago via email because I wanted to tell
[1:45:02.820 --> 1:45:05.220]  you this so bad because I didn't think anybody would believe.
[1:45:05.220 --> 1:45:10.220]  Oh, no, no. Now that you said fast and furious, that makes, later we learned it was millions
[1:45:10.220 --> 1:45:12.220]  of firearms and ammunition.
[1:45:12.220 --> 1:45:19.980]  Sir, you have no idea. I'm talking 144 hours of overtime every two weeks worth of weapons.
[1:45:19.980 --> 1:45:24.900]  There was 12 of us doing this and we could not clean them, wipe the cosmoline off of
[1:45:24.900 --> 1:45:29.740]  them, test fire them, break them down, put them back up and put them back on that 53
[1:45:29.740 --> 1:45:31.740]  foot trailer fast enough.
[1:45:31.740 --> 1:45:35.820]  Actually, I had Tosh Plumlee on. I don't know how he's doing these days. He's super old
[1:45:35.820 --> 1:45:41.820]  CIA contractor, very famous, the famous church committee whistleblower. He came on and blew
[1:45:41.820 --> 1:45:48.500]  the whistle about how they were shipping these guns into Mexico and then from El Chapo out
[1:45:48.500 --> 1:45:54.020]  into Syria for the Arab Spring. And so that actually came out. What you're saying actually
[1:45:54.020 --> 1:45:59.060]  came out in the news, but got almost no attention. So that's, and even this new Biden official,
[1:45:59.060 --> 1:46:03.380]  I've got him in the article here today. He said Al Qaeda is a U. S. ally. Did you see
[1:46:03.380 --> 1:46:04.380]  that?
[1:46:04.380 --> 1:46:10.940]  Yes, sir. That is what worries me. And my whole point is the ones like myself who started
[1:46:10.940 --> 1:46:15.220]  asking questions, you know, excuse my language, but why the hell are we, you know, why are
[1:46:15.220 --> 1:46:23.740]  we doing something AK 47? Why? You know, shortly thereafter, we got sent home. The other people
[1:46:23.740 --> 1:46:29.100]  stayed. But the more literally Alex, we had to, they put us up in the six bedroom house
[1:46:29.100 --> 1:46:34.060]  and San Antonio Texas, look like something off MTV Cribs. Okay. We had to leave our
[1:46:34.060 --> 1:46:37.940]  cell phones. We could not take our cell phones to work. And if we had to make a personal
[1:46:37.940 --> 1:46:45.700]  call, it literally, my mother's listening right now, 55555555555 John Doe. That's what
[1:46:45.700 --> 1:46:54.140]  would show up on the color ID. Okay. And the government has a way of manipulating people
[1:46:54.140 --> 1:46:58.580]  so that you don't know you're being manipulated. Like you said earlier, oh, good slave. Do
[1:46:58.580 --> 1:47:04.180]  what we say. The ones that that question that, you know, well, why are we doing this? Why
[1:47:04.180 --> 1:47:09.500]  are we doing that? That makes, you know, I guess dangerous. And I'm pulled over here
[1:47:09.500 --> 1:47:16.140]  on Interstate 10. And, and, you know, I've been running COVID this whole time produce.
[1:47:16.140 --> 1:47:22.900]  I mean, this is time crucial freight that we run here, Alex. And I have until 48 hours
[1:47:22.900 --> 1:47:31.740]  ago, man, all the border patrols on eight, on 10, on 70 Alamogordo, New Mexico. Okay.
[1:47:31.740 --> 1:47:36.500]  Nobody's working. Oh, it's just the first time in three years that I haven't seen.
[1:47:36.500 --> 1:47:41.100]  Oh, absolutely. Biden ordered the border patrol to stand down. And now there's a whistleblower
[1:47:41.100 --> 1:47:46.540]  that literally asked a border patrol officer at a truck stop. I said, Hey, man, what the
[1:47:46.540 --> 1:47:51.260]  hell is going on? Why aren't y'all working? He said, Hey, man, are y'all hard? We're
[1:47:51.260 --> 1:47:58.980]  about to be looking for a job. You know, I mean, so people, be careful. You know, I'm
[1:47:58.980 --> 1:48:02.180]  just, I hear you Jeremy. I appreciate your calling and talk to you for hours, but I guess
[1:48:02.180 --> 1:48:06.380]  the next person amazing story, but it's not his opinion. I don't think he's lying about
[1:48:06.380 --> 1:48:10.980]  what he did. I think it's true, but we know it's true. That's what Obama did. And then
[1:48:10.980 --> 1:48:16.300]  he blamed the guns and deaths in Mexico on gun owners America and said, man, the guns,
[1:48:16.300 --> 1:48:20.660]  he didn't just ship them to al-Qaeda to launch the air of spring that came out. He then blamed
[1:48:20.660 --> 1:48:27.220]  us for it. That's another false flag. Fast and furious is an open and shut false flag.
[1:48:27.220 --> 1:48:31.220]  All right, let's take another call here. Jam one more in here. Let's go ahead and talk
[1:48:31.220 --> 1:48:37.340]  to Joe, Alabama, the John in North Carolina. Go ahead, Joe. Hey, Alex, we have to look
[1:48:37.340 --> 1:48:42.020]  to our past to know where our future goes. And when we look at Joe Cain, Joe Cain is
[1:48:42.020 --> 1:48:48.620]  a Confederate soldier from 1867 that stood up against the union lockdown. He paraded
[1:48:48.620 --> 1:48:54.220]  around mobile with his band of the lost cause minstrels and showed the union soldiers that
[1:48:54.220 --> 1:48:59.180]  we were free people that we could come together, that we could celebrate in the street of our
[1:48:59.180 --> 1:49:06.820]  own city. And I think that across the nation, we need to have Mardi Gras globally nationwide
[1:49:06.820 --> 1:49:10.860]  to show that we are not sick of that the other day. We need to call for anti COVID block
[1:49:10.860 --> 1:49:14.820]  parties and just organize them and just have them in every city. And most of the police
[1:49:14.820 --> 1:49:18.380]  will support you, but they give you a problem and you got to go to court. I mean, let's
[1:49:18.380 --> 1:49:22.660]  come out, let's have parties, let's take the mask off, let's show the sheeple that it's
[1:49:22.660 --> 1:49:26.460]  a takeover plan because they admit it's all a fraud to take over plan, have these parties
[1:49:26.460 --> 1:49:31.060]  to be educational events. I totally agree with you.
[1:49:31.060 --> 1:49:34.660]  Bill County Sheriff's Department has said they are going to stand down during Mardi
[1:49:34.660 --> 1:49:40.940]  Gras and allow us to have our parties. I think, I think, you know, mobile as a whole has a
[1:49:40.940 --> 1:49:44.380]  very checkered history. We had the last one, wasn't that beautiful? How the Trump rallies,
[1:49:44.380 --> 1:49:47.540]  nobody was wearing mask at the end. I mean, we see through this crap.
[1:49:47.540 --> 1:49:53.340]  Oh, it was amazing. I was not a Trump supporter when Trump ran, but I became a Trump supporter
[1:49:53.340 --> 1:49:58.300]  through his policies and his actions. Boy, aren't folks going to miss, aren't people
[1:49:58.300 --> 1:50:04.180]  going to miss Trump under Biden? I mean, he is just butchering this country.
[1:50:04.180 --> 1:50:09.540]  It's amazing what he's doing. He is breaking us down as individuals, taking away all of
[1:50:09.540 --> 1:50:17.140]  our liberties and we need to come together and stand up against it and fight in a peaceful,
[1:50:17.140 --> 1:50:22.540]  peaceful way. Not a bloody civil war. We don't need another bloody civil war.
[1:50:22.540 --> 1:50:26.300]  Oh, they all want us fighting to kill each other. That's what the Chai comms in EU want.
[1:50:26.300 --> 1:50:33.580]  We need to come out with peaceful demonstrations, nonviolent, civil disobedience and absolutely
[1:50:33.580 --> 1:50:38.100]  just say no to the whole. So that means going to the mall, not wearing mask, have a demonstration.
[1:50:38.100 --> 1:50:42.500]  That means going to your church, take the mask off, get out of your comfort zone, folks
[1:50:42.500 --> 1:50:45.820]  with a mask are never coming off. And we have the proof of Klaus Schwab and all the rest
[1:50:45.820 --> 1:50:51.020]  of them now admitting that this is a permanent lockdown, a total power grab.
[1:50:51.020 --> 1:50:56.340]  Mask, mask off mobile is what I'm pushing right now and I'm not doing it on social media.
[1:50:56.340 --> 1:51:01.420]  I'm doing it word of mouth. And we are coming together on the Sunday before Fat Tuesday and
[1:51:01.420 --> 1:51:09.020]  we are going to party in the streets. Mobile is 52% black and 48% white and we all come
[1:51:09.020 --> 1:51:14.380]  together. They don't want us coming together. They want us watching MSNBC. So we all hate
[1:51:14.380 --> 1:51:18.660]  each other and believe we're all racist. All right. Our number three coming up. I'm
[1:51:18.660 --> 1:51:22.140]  going to take a few more calls before Robert Barnes joins us. I never got to the Bill Gates
[1:51:22.140 --> 1:51:25.860]  incredible news. Well, that is just over the top. He has a giant global board with us
[1:51:25.860 --> 1:51:30.620]  as pawns and he's in control of them. And this is a real psycho mental patient. That's
[1:51:30.620 --> 1:51:35.940]  coming up next hour. Robert Barnes on the lockdown, the martial law constitutional lawyer,
[1:51:35.940 --> 1:51:50.900]  calls. I'm Alex Jones. Please spread the word about the local station. You're listening
[1:51:50.900 --> 1:51:51.900]  to.
[1:51:51.900 --> 1:51:56.580]  We have the technocrats are controlling the food supplies, secure your own safe source
[1:51:56.580 --> 1:52:00.940]  of food supply sale. It's the new prices in 2021, but it's the lowest price for high
[1:52:00.940 --> 1:52:05.380]  quality food. You're going to find at infowarstore.com. The subsection is prepared with alex.com.
[1:52:05.380 --> 1:52:09.500]  The last 25 years, one month, three months, six months, one year supplies, and it's the
[1:52:09.500 --> 1:52:13.380]  highest quality you're going to find. And it's just good to have that check box taken
[1:52:13.380 --> 1:52:16.820]  care of. And you know, you're getting good food at a very good price. And you know that
[1:52:16.820 --> 1:52:20.420]  a small percentage of it because there's not much profit in this goes to us to fund our
[1:52:20.420 --> 1:52:26.940]  operation. So prepare with alex.com or infowarstore.com. You can find the preparedness section there,
[1:52:26.940 --> 1:52:30.540]  water filtration, air filtration. It's all there. The technocrats are getting ready to
[1:52:30.540 --> 1:52:34.020]  bring in all the force GMO and more. It's time to start getting prepared. It starts with
[1:52:34.020 --> 1:52:37.620]  self defense. It starts with a being prepared. It starts with horrible food. It starts with
[1:52:37.620 --> 1:52:40.580]  digging in with a long globalist fight. You'll want in the end.
[1:52:44.580 --> 1:52:48.860]  The pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to
[1:52:48.860 --> 1:52:53.740]  redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income, which of course the United
[1:52:53.740 --> 1:52:57.540]  Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally
[1:52:57.540 --> 1:53:03.700]  a chip under your skin. It's all now completely official part of the UN great reset of the
[1:53:03.700 --> 1:53:08.780]  Davos group and cloud Schwab, all officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab
[1:53:08.780 --> 1:53:13.420]  and Rockefeller Foundation, all the rest of them at 10 to 21, 20 to 30. It's here and
[1:53:13.420 --> 1:53:18.340]  only gets worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject
[1:53:18.340 --> 1:53:24.940]  it all. And the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle, good versus evil and
[1:53:24.940 --> 1:53:30.780]  stopping abortion. We must start valuing human life again. We must start saying that we are
[1:53:30.780 --> 1:53:37.420]  not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential. Until we do that, we
[1:53:37.420 --> 1:53:42.260]  are all slaves. We must stand up and declare our basic God given human rights now.
[1:53:47.380 --> 1:53:50.340]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:50.340 --> 1:54:10.420]  I'm no stranger to the rain. I'm a friend of thunder. A friend, is it any wonder a
[1:54:10.420 --> 1:54:23.180]  lightning strikes me? I fought with the devil, got down on his level, but I never gave in.
[1:54:23.180 --> 1:54:25.100]  So he gave it all to me.
[1:54:26.100 --> 1:54:30.460]  As you know the witness, I'm no stranger to the rain.
[1:54:30.460 --> 1:54:36.460]  Best part about fighting tyranny is that you get to meet a lot of cool people. They all
[1:54:36.460 --> 1:54:40.380]  got that light in their eyes. They could be black, they could be Hispanic, they could be white,
[1:54:40.380 --> 1:54:49.620]  old, young, doesn't matter. They have got that light in their eyes. And those that serve Satan
[1:54:49.620 --> 1:54:54.860]  don't have that light, do they? But the really sad part is most people don't have the light
[1:54:54.860 --> 1:54:58.660]  in their eyes. They don't have the evil in their eyes either. They have the eyes of a
[1:54:58.660 --> 1:55:04.380]  sleeping man, a sleeping woman. They're in a trance and I'm here to not show you the
[1:55:04.380 --> 1:55:08.780]  world, but to try to get you to wake up so you can see it for what it is. I'm here to
[1:55:08.780 --> 1:55:14.260]  awaken you. You will do the rest. I'm not trying to make you see what I see or believe
[1:55:14.260 --> 1:55:18.700]  what I believe. I'm not a Satanist. I believe in you and I believe once you see your free
[1:55:18.700 --> 1:55:23.500]  will and take your destiny in hand that you will be an asset to humanity and I need your
[1:55:23.500 --> 1:55:24.500]  help.
[1:55:24.500 --> 1:55:33.340]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to John in North Carolina, then we'll go to Duncan
[1:55:33.340 --> 1:55:35.500]  and others. John, thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[1:55:35.500 --> 1:55:40.940]  Thank you so much, Alex. I just wanted to try to awaken people just like yourself and
[1:55:40.940 --> 1:55:47.860]  say we got to realize, put the normalcy bias down. We are under common control right now.
[1:55:47.860 --> 1:55:51.620]  And it's really time for folks to, if they haven't already done so, like you said so
[1:55:51.620 --> 1:55:56.620]  many times, get hard copies of these things. Look back at your documentaries, look back
[1:55:56.620 --> 1:56:01.900]  at the videos. The first time I saw you was on wake up or wake up. And I've been looking
[1:56:01.900 --> 1:56:06.620]  at some of the hands. Well, that's a Mike Hansen documentary. That's like 23 or 24 years
[1:56:06.620 --> 1:56:07.620]  old.
[1:56:07.620 --> 1:56:13.500]  Absolutely. And I think so much people can draw from those parallels of how they demonize
[1:56:13.500 --> 1:56:18.820]  the Patriots with Ruby Ridge with Waco with Oklahoma City bombing. It's a repeat of what
[1:56:18.820 --> 1:56:22.980]  they did in the nineties and they're exactly those are all microcosm tests. Now they're
[1:56:22.980 --> 1:56:24.700]  doing on the big scale.
[1:56:24.700 --> 1:56:30.620]  Absolutely. And people need to realize that who wins the war, right? The history. So if
[1:56:30.620 --> 1:56:34.740]  the Patriots want to educate their children and their progeny, they need to get these
[1:56:34.740 --> 1:56:40.300]  documents now and start educating them and getting out of the reeducation camps that
[1:56:40.300 --> 1:56:44.620]  are and is the cult of academia. That's where I'm working in the cult of academia. I could
[1:56:44.620 --> 1:56:48.700]  talk at nauseam about that, but I'll do it another time. But those are some key issues
[1:56:48.700 --> 1:56:52.060]  that people really need to grasp here.
[1:56:52.060 --> 1:56:57.100]  Well, academia and medicine are cloistered internal professions that are tend to become
[1:56:57.100 --> 1:57:02.380]  adults. But yeah, if you look at academia, now it's anti free speech. Now it's authoritarian.
[1:57:02.380 --> 1:57:07.020]  I mean, it's it's it's speak a few minutes about what academia has become.
[1:57:07.020 --> 1:57:14.340]  Oh man, I mean, I won't give too much away, but in the university here and it's it's nothing
[1:57:14.340 --> 1:57:20.020]  but indoctrination from I say K through 12 indoctrination college university weaponization.
[1:57:20.020 --> 1:57:25.180]  And that's exactly what it is. So they indoctrinate the children K through 12. And by the time
[1:57:25.180 --> 1:57:30.500]  they get to college, they can weaponize that with the Marxist full ideology. Once they've
[1:57:30.500 --> 1:57:35.100]  been conditioned to hate themselves, to hate their nation, to hate everything good, then
[1:57:35.100 --> 1:57:39.300]  they can really weaponize that. And that's what you're seeing on the street with BLM
[1:57:39.300 --> 1:57:43.940]  and Antifa and the like. These are weaponized individuals. So I mean, it's almost sad when
[1:57:43.940 --> 1:57:46.780]  you look at what they've done to these people.
[1:57:46.780 --> 1:57:51.020]  And it's all because the parents, the child is ready to hear the truth when they're young,
[1:57:51.020 --> 1:57:55.820]  ready to be told basically the parables as Christ would teach about real things of putting
[1:57:55.820 --> 1:57:59.660]  it in stories. Children are ready to hear that they're ready to interface and they're
[1:57:59.660 --> 1:58:03.300]  ready to understand what you've got to tell them to not trust the system and to be their
[1:58:03.300 --> 1:58:07.940]  own individual self. But instead, that's not done. These mothers just induct their children
[1:58:07.940 --> 1:58:12.860]  in to sit on the laps in many cases of convicted pedophiles.
[1:58:12.860 --> 1:58:19.980]  They do. And they they take God out of schools. I mean, that's the key. Take God out and put
[1:58:19.980 --> 1:58:23.100]  the state in.
[1:58:23.100 --> 1:58:29.140]  Well said, my friend. Thank you, John. All right, Freeman, Duncan, Chris, Anthony, Larry,
[1:58:29.140 --> 1:58:33.020]  Frankie, Judy, I will get to every one of those calls, but no more. I want to talk to
[1:58:33.020 --> 1:58:36.500]  you all. The first Barnes is on for a while, then we'll be happy to take calls on these
[1:58:36.500 --> 1:58:41.420]  subjects. Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, good friend of mine is straight ahead on the
[1:58:41.420 --> 1:58:47.060]  other side concerning martial law in America and what's being rolled out and how we counter.
[1:58:47.060 --> 1:58:54.060]  Stay with us.
[1:59:17.060 --> 1:59:24.140]  One month we launched a new URL before they banned it, but Soros and Bill Gates and the
[1:59:24.140 --> 1:59:32.780]  globalists are on our tail. But the new website is the resistance.video, the resistance.video.
[1:59:32.780 --> 1:59:37.500]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them. So the new
[1:59:37.500 --> 1:59:42.420]  URL that links right to band.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries
[1:59:42.420 --> 1:59:47.300]  and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is that the resistance.video.
[1:59:47.300 --> 1:59:52.300]  Share the link, the resistance.video, the resistance.video.
[1:59:52.300 --> 2:00:04.300]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[2:00:04.300 --> 2:00:18.300]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who was a parent.
[2:00:18.300 --> 2:00:19.300]  Alex Jones.
[2:00:19.300 --> 2:00:20.300]  Scott, Russian, Scott.
[2:00:20.300 --> 2:00:21.300]  Until war comes to mind.
[2:00:21.300 --> 2:00:42.300]  Reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[2:00:42.300 --> 2:00:50.500]  So we are in a paradox right now. Trump won the landslide, surrounded by cowards, surrounded
[2:00:50.500 --> 2:00:56.900]  by bad advice other than barns and a few others. He had nobody there at the end and had to
[2:00:56.900 --> 2:01:00.940]  leave. The Q phenomenon, design of the globalist deep state, everybody think we were invincible
[2:01:00.940 --> 2:01:04.660]  so they wouldn't be mobilized. Now they learned that most of the Q people arrested at the
[2:01:04.660 --> 2:01:08.220]  Capitol did not vote. They thought there was no need to vote. That's in the Associated
[2:01:08.220 --> 2:01:12.340]  Press today. And I'm not bashing the Q people. I knew they were going to keep using this
[2:01:12.340 --> 2:01:16.180]  now to say, oh, there's no Jeffrey Epstein. There's no world government. There's no new
[2:01:16.180 --> 2:01:21.340]  world order. Q discredited all that. Q made all that up. No, Q came around and hijacked
[2:01:21.340 --> 2:01:25.580]  our awakening to the globalist and ran it in the ground. It's okay. I've been conned
[2:01:25.580 --> 2:01:29.860]  before. I'm not perfect either. I'm not judging you if you got into the Q lunacy. I get these
[2:01:29.860 --> 2:01:34.180]  are scary times. You want to believe everything's okay, but you've got to get down to brass
[2:01:34.180 --> 2:01:38.980]  tax. It's you working with others. With God's help, it's going to change this.
[2:01:38.980 --> 2:01:42.740]  Barnes can only come on for 30 minutes yesterday, but I twisted his arm to come back today.
[2:01:42.740 --> 2:01:52.740]  He's one of the best spoken as well. He's here with us to talk about historically politically
[2:01:52.740 --> 2:01:56.620]  where we are because we all have a normalcy bias, including myself. I've lived in a free
[2:01:56.620 --> 2:02:02.420]  country so long that we're now going under martial law. We have martial law censorship.
[2:02:02.420 --> 2:02:06.260]  Everybody else has shut down, but me, we built the infrastructure knew it knowing it was
[2:02:06.260 --> 2:02:10.900]  coming, literally. And they are now coming in saying former Deputy Director of CIA, we're
[2:02:10.900 --> 2:02:15.100]  going to hunt down Republicans. We're going to get them. You've got Tucker Carlson reading
[2:02:15.100 --> 2:02:19.460]  quotes on a show where Democrats want the military to crush their opposition. Washington
[2:02:19.460 --> 2:02:24.540]  Post headline yesterday was we're going to hunt down conservatives like they're the Taliban
[2:02:24.540 --> 2:02:32.060]  around Kyda. Other quotes out of the new Obama administration, which is the run mother puppet
[2:02:32.060 --> 2:02:38.260]  in a titular finger head way, Joe Biden. This is really Obama and his third administration
[2:02:38.260 --> 2:02:43.100]  is launching all these new wars, engaging in all the surveillance persecution of whistleblowers.
[2:02:43.100 --> 2:02:48.420]  I mean, this is bonafide tyranny. So I want to speak to that and speak to the latest COVID
[2:02:48.420 --> 2:02:53.460]  information coming out from John Hopkins that indeed we had the same number of deaths roughly
[2:02:53.460 --> 2:02:57.700]  last year in the year before it is a fraud. And now we learn from documents that came
[2:02:57.700 --> 2:03:02.660]  out on Meet the Press and other statements by Biden administration planners that it's
[2:03:02.660 --> 2:03:06.540]  a five year lockdown. He's going to take restrictions off of the summer and then bring them back
[2:03:06.540 --> 2:03:11.780]  permanently for four and a half years, bankrupting all small businesses. This is something no
[2:03:11.780 --> 2:03:18.700]  foreign enemy can carry out the literal annihilation of Main Street and a corporate consolidation.
[2:03:18.700 --> 2:03:23.620]  So Barnes, there's a lot I just put out there to unpack and we'll get into other issues
[2:03:23.620 --> 2:03:29.300]  as well. But what are we in historically? And what do you expect to unfold out of this?
[2:03:29.300 --> 2:03:33.180]  And what can we do? Well, I mean, first we have an unprecedented
[2:03:33.180 --> 2:03:38.700]  attempt to borrow someone from even running from office after they're no longer in office.
[2:03:38.700 --> 2:03:42.720]  So I mean, that's I mean, today, the president lawyers filed their response, their answer
[2:03:42.720 --> 2:03:46.740]  to the impeachment. Let's cover that first. We'll get into the
[2:03:46.740 --> 2:03:51.780]  martial law. Go ahead. So it was a solid response, but not spectacular. You know, it reminded
[2:03:51.780 --> 2:03:56.220]  me a lot of Trump's tenure that there were some real achievements and then some real
[2:03:56.220 --> 2:04:01.140]  missed opportunities because the the allegations in the impeachment are that merely raising
[2:04:01.140 --> 2:04:06.180]  questions about the election constituted illicit incitement. And not only is that a threat
[2:04:06.180 --> 2:04:11.620]  to the First Amendment, it's also a threat to the way in which the it's trying to gaslight
[2:04:11.620 --> 2:04:16.340]  everybody is the one that opens the door for Trump to bring up the election. Exactly. And
[2:04:16.340 --> 2:04:19.980]  so I'd hope that that they would be aggressive. This was a written response. They could go
[2:04:19.980 --> 2:04:24.740]  into detail. They could highlight the critical points about this. That, you know, first,
[2:04:24.740 --> 2:04:29.420]  a bunch of people that didn't were not legally qualified to vote voted that a bunch of people
[2:04:29.420 --> 2:04:34.780]  that vote cast their ballots in a manner that were not legally qualified. And third, the
[2:04:34.780 --> 2:04:38.980]  votes were counted in a manner that was not legally consistent or constitutional. They
[2:04:38.980 --> 2:04:44.180]  don't raise any of the three. Instead, they kind of hide. So that was unfortunate to witness.
[2:04:44.180 --> 2:04:48.300]  And it suggests that they were only willing to go part of the way compared to where the
[2:04:48.300 --> 2:04:54.500]  president had suggested he wanted them to go. So we're still seeing some limits in his defense,
[2:04:54.500 --> 2:04:59.380]  which is unfortunate. But it's a mere it's the fact that they're willing to reinvigorate
[2:04:59.380 --> 2:05:03.980]  the 14th Amendment in a way that was never intended. The 14th Amendment being passed
[2:05:03.980 --> 2:05:09.620]  during a civil war amendment meant to prohibit people who were part of the Confederacy from
[2:05:09.620 --> 2:05:14.700]  joining the new federal government. Congress is now claiming they can use that to bar anyone
[2:05:14.700 --> 2:05:20.100]  they want from office forever by just labeling what they did, quote unquote, insurrection.
[2:05:20.100 --> 2:05:25.500]  I mean, this is an incredible consolidation of power. And you have AOC and all the Democrats
[2:05:25.500 --> 2:05:29.900]  saying all Republicans basically are terrorists just because they're in a party and none of
[2:05:29.900 --> 2:05:32.300]  them even have a right to be in the chamber. It's it's amazing.
[2:05:32.300 --> 2:05:37.020]  I mean, we haven't seen anything like this in the United States, frankly, ever. We've
[2:05:37.020 --> 2:05:40.900]  seen it in places like Cuba. We've seen it in places like the Soviet Union, where what
[2:05:40.900 --> 2:05:44.900]  happens is they often have elections in these countries. There's just only one party that's
[2:05:44.900 --> 2:05:49.100]  allowed to be on the ballot. And that's functionally what they're looking to do. They're looking
[2:05:49.100 --> 2:05:52.820]  to say that you won't even be allowed to vote for these people, because if you do, they
[2:05:52.820 --> 2:05:58.380]  won't be allowed to sit in office. And that's the path that's that that's the perilous Pandora's
[2:05:58.380 --> 2:06:05.340]  box. So they're really trying this expulsion. Yes, absolutely. They're doing it twofold.
[2:06:05.340 --> 2:06:11.700]  One they want to say claim that just a majority vote in the in the Senate allows them to disbar
[2:06:11.700 --> 2:06:16.980]  from office forever anyone they want, regardless of whether it's the president, whether it's
[2:06:16.980 --> 2:06:21.980]  an existing office holder or a future potential office holder, they want to use this case
[2:06:21.980 --> 2:06:26.980]  to set legal precedent that they can go out and just start barring people from office
[2:06:26.980 --> 2:06:32.620]  on the ground. That officially put us in a dictatorship by oligarchy. I mean, effectively,
[2:06:32.620 --> 2:06:36.260]  and once you have one party government, you no longer have a functional democracy. That's
[2:06:36.260 --> 2:06:40.780]  for sure. You no longer have a representative democracy. That's for sure when the people
[2:06:40.780 --> 2:06:48.740]  can't even vote into office, the people they want to oligarchy or plutocracy. Well, really,
[2:06:48.740 --> 2:06:52.700]  it's more like a what I call it state is a writ large, but it's really a one party state.
[2:06:52.700 --> 2:06:57.420]  That's what it functionally for communist. So yeah, exactly. It's a sort of a autocracy
[2:06:57.420 --> 2:07:02.500]  of kind, where only one party in one group has all the power is allowed to permitted
[2:07:02.500 --> 2:07:09.300]  to have all the power. So it's deeply problematic where they're going. That's why the president
[2:07:09.300 --> 2:07:13.340]  has some good aspects he incorporated. They're his lawyers incorporate all the defenses
[2:07:13.340 --> 2:07:17.540]  that we talked about, including the First Amendment defense that I've been urging, including
[2:07:17.540 --> 2:07:21.260]  the bill of attainer defense that I've been urging, as well as the unconstitutionality
[2:07:21.260 --> 2:07:25.540]  of the impeachment writ large. They do do a good job of incorporating all of those aspects
[2:07:25.540 --> 2:07:31.780]  to preserve those for future reference. But the they could have been much more assertive
[2:07:31.780 --> 2:07:36.820]  on the 14th Amendment's limitations, much more Congress has never made the claim that
[2:07:36.820 --> 2:07:40.580]  they're trying to make now. That's what we're talking about. What's the historical context?
[2:07:40.580 --> 2:07:44.700]  We're seeing things we have never witnessed in American history. We're seeing a militarily
[2:07:44.700 --> 2:07:50.380]  occupied capital that we haven't seen at times of war. And then we're seeing Congress attempt
[2:07:50.380 --> 2:07:54.700]  to do things in exclusion from people from the Senate, exclusion from people from being
[2:07:54.700 --> 2:07:58.660]  able to run for office, convicting people on impeachment when they're not even holding
[2:07:58.660 --> 2:08:03.940]  office, disbarring anybody they dislike from ever being able to run for office. These are
[2:08:03.940 --> 2:08:09.340]  all unprecedented events and using the power of impeachment, the power of disbarment, the
[2:08:09.340 --> 2:08:13.220]  power of removal to punish speech they don't like.
[2:08:13.220 --> 2:08:17.900]  And what do you expect of a group that just stole an election? They know they're illegitimate.
[2:08:17.900 --> 2:08:20.620]  And so now they've already gone this far. It's clear they're just going to keep going
[2:08:20.620 --> 2:08:22.620]  and going and going.
[2:08:22.620 --> 2:08:26.540]  Exactly. And that's why I hope the president puts up a little bit more of a fight with
[2:08:26.540 --> 2:08:31.380]  the Congress needs to be put on trial. The Senate needs to be put on trial because they
[2:08:31.380 --> 2:08:35.620]  are the ones threatening democracy. They are the ones threatening constitutional.
[2:08:35.620 --> 2:08:39.780]  And you get that and Tucker Carlson gets that and I get that and Tulsi Gabbard gets it.
[2:08:39.780 --> 2:08:44.220]  Why doesn't can't Trump find lawyers that aren't damn cowards?
[2:08:44.220 --> 2:08:48.380]  It's been a constant problem. Essentially, he goes back and forth between people that
[2:08:48.380 --> 2:08:51.980]  are so outside the system. They're ineffective. The Sidney Powell's of the world.
[2:08:51.980 --> 2:08:56.060]  Yeah, like martial law, cue stuff, or we can't do anything.
[2:08:56.060 --> 2:09:00.420]  Or institutional insiders. There was an Axio story today about the internal discussion
[2:09:00.420 --> 2:09:04.980]  that happened back on the 18th. And it shows you, I mean, my view is both sides were embarrassing.
[2:09:04.980 --> 2:09:08.700]  The side that Powell and Woodward were arguing and Flynn was arguing was not credible. But
[2:09:08.700 --> 2:09:12.220]  so was the side of all these insiders. These insiders made false statements about what was
[2:09:12.220 --> 2:09:17.420]  happening in the election, false statements about what Barr did. And the people like me
[2:09:17.420 --> 2:09:21.900]  have occasionally been able to break through to the president and give him a third option.
[2:09:21.900 --> 2:09:26.260]  Someone who's savvy and smart without being part of the institutional corruption. But
[2:09:26.260 --> 2:09:31.100]  it's tough to do and it's tough to maintain it because he has all of these other people
[2:09:31.100 --> 2:09:34.940]  constantly whispering in his ear saying go a different route.
[2:09:34.940 --> 2:09:38.740]  You know, he's a good businessman and doesn't want to screw America, but he just doesn't
[2:09:38.740 --> 2:09:42.380]  have the conspiratorial understanding of the globalist and the history of this. Robert
[2:09:42.380 --> 2:09:45.340]  Barnes, let's come back then and unpack what you think's going to happen to the trial that
[2:09:45.340 --> 2:09:50.340]  starts next week. And then I want to look at COVID and the martial law and I mean, just
[2:09:50.340 --> 2:09:51.340]  all of it.
[2:09:51.340 --> 2:09:55.500]  I've got some bad news. Our best selling vitamin mineral fusion has sold out because people

[2:10:52.100 --> 2:10:57.420]  man? Is this the guy that called in about living defense? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I've been
[2:10:57.420 --> 2:11:02.500]  trying to get a hold of you since Monday when I heard you got that fresh shipment of living
[2:11:02.500 --> 2:11:08.380]  defense in from Utah. I said, man, I got to get on that show and give him an update. I
[2:11:08.380 --> 2:11:13.980]  said, if I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones show, I'm gonna tell the world about
[2:11:13.980 --> 2:11:20.460]  living defense and what it did for me personally. Now look, I'm 64 years old going on 20. Thanks
[2:11:20.460 --> 2:11:25.940]  to this info war store products. And by the way, I bought $800 worth the other night.
[2:11:25.940 --> 2:11:31.340]  So I'm doing what I can problem. So what my my contention is, why don't we start this
[2:11:31.340 --> 2:11:36.300]  new year off right with everybody getting a couple bottles of living defense? Now you
[2:11:36.300 --> 2:11:41.820]  got to follow that up with the micro ZX. I learned that. So it's like God working is
[2:11:41.820 --> 2:11:47.140]  so amazing. We didn't know we didn't screen your call. We had no idea and I go to you
[2:11:47.140 --> 2:11:54.100]  a year later and you're here telling me about living defense, living defense, living defense.
[2:11:54.100 --> 2:11:57.380]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:11:57.380 --> 2:12:23.380]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[2:12:23.380 --> 2:12:44.780]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning. I will not let you down. You'll be very,
[2:12:44.780 --> 2:12:56.340]  very impressed, I hope. And I think we'll be speaking a lot. This means that Donald Trump
[2:12:56.340 --> 2:13:01.300]  will be the 45th president of the United States. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[2:13:01.300 --> 2:13:06.020]  All right, Robert Barnes is our guest constitutional lawyer, really smart historian, good friend
[2:13:06.020 --> 2:13:12.380]  of mine, one of the smartest people I know. Bob, you said it's all uncharted territory,
[2:13:12.380 --> 2:13:16.540]  but it's classical tyranny. I mean, if it was a whiskey, it'd be 200 proof, which means
[2:13:16.540 --> 2:13:22.700]  for those that don't know, that's mean pure alcohol. This is like moonshine, white lightning.
[2:13:22.700 --> 2:13:29.060]  Hitler was like 100 proof rum. And he was bad. Stalin was about 100 proof rum as well.
[2:13:29.060 --> 2:13:35.100]  This is white lightning. I've never seen anything like it. And it's a bureaucracy where Stalin
[2:13:35.100 --> 2:13:39.020]  and Hitler, the buck stopped there. Mao Zedong buck stopped there. This is a bureaucracy
[2:13:39.020 --> 2:13:46.460]  of oligarchs and authoritarians. I guess the word is it's a just a centralized fascist
[2:13:46.460 --> 2:13:51.020]  model. You call it communist, but they're all disconnected from what they're really
[2:13:51.020 --> 2:13:55.620]  doing. Just like all the reports say that big tech is in their own class. They don't
[2:13:55.620 --> 2:14:00.940]  know how to order food or live their lives. And they're pushing something that personally
[2:14:00.940 --> 2:14:05.180]  I look at I know is explosive like a chemistry set combination. This is going to cause an
[2:14:05.180 --> 2:14:10.460]  explosion. This is not good. I'm passing. But hey, the globalist at this point, they're
[2:14:10.460 --> 2:14:16.380]  just completely psychotic. What is your view on that they want more troops in DC that they're
[2:14:16.380 --> 2:14:21.060]  all over the news? As you know, announcing they're going to quote, root out and hunt
[2:14:21.060 --> 2:14:26.580]  down Trump supporters. I can play the clips for hours here. I mean, this is declaration
[2:14:26.580 --> 2:14:32.780]  of war foaming at the mouth of sanity. What is the psychology here? What is going on?
[2:14:32.780 --> 2:14:40.940]  We're trying to normalize statism and oppression at an everyday level to where the next generation
[2:14:40.940 --> 2:14:45.140]  will think of these things as normal. And the same way that the current generation,
[2:14:45.140 --> 2:14:49.380]  Gen X and millennials, see what happens at airports is totally normal that in order to
[2:14:49.380 --> 2:14:53.900]  fly somewhere, you have to go through all of these securities, all these invasive mechanisms
[2:14:53.900 --> 2:14:58.980]  of looking at the bones underneath your own body, all of that they see as normal because
[2:14:58.980 --> 2:15:05.740]  they grew up with it. If they were born after 2001 or started using airports after 2001,
[2:15:05.740 --> 2:15:10.060]  they're trying to make normal things like wearing however many things on you a medical
[2:15:10.060 --> 2:15:17.660]  sharia law, where now the CDC is claiming authority over buses. I mean, the CDC is supposed
[2:15:17.660 --> 2:15:22.420]  to be the Center for Disease Control. And Uber and and Uber just a total just explain
[2:15:22.420 --> 2:15:27.580]  as a lawyer, the insanity of that jurisdictional announcement, totally illegal. So what CDC
[2:15:27.580 --> 2:15:32.580]  is supposed to be about is mostly making recommendations, helping with vaccines, helping with drugs
[2:15:32.580 --> 2:15:38.420]  and disease control. What they are not supposed to be is your local transit authority. What
[2:15:38.420 --> 2:15:42.860]  they're not supposed to be is monitoring what happens on your local school bus and your
[2:15:42.860 --> 2:15:47.380]  local Uber car and your local taxi. But that is what they're doing. They're they're they
[2:15:47.380 --> 2:15:53.460]  have made themselves a supranational transit authority monitoring for all means of transportation.
[2:15:53.460 --> 2:15:57.740]  I remember what Bill Gates said, I have the video coming in next segment, since you mentioned
[2:15:57.740 --> 2:16:02.940]  this, he said we need a UN run global authority that controls all transit. So this is really
[2:16:02.940 --> 2:16:07.980]  Bill Gates is in charge of the UN and the WHO. And now he's telling you he'll be in
[2:16:07.980 --> 2:16:11.580]  charge of everything through the National Health Department. I mean, this is insane.
[2:16:11.580 --> 2:16:17.460]  And Oh, Johnson said two months ago, he said, when we run the G8 this year, I'm in control
[2:16:17.460 --> 2:16:22.180]  the G8, I'm putting Bill Gates in charge of the G8. So what the who is Bill Gates? This
[2:16:22.180 --> 2:16:28.780]  is insane. It is what it is is taking what has traditionally been our right, our right
[2:16:28.780 --> 2:16:33.860]  by common law, our right by custom and tradition, our right by the Constitution is concentrated
[2:16:33.860 --> 2:16:39.060]  there in and making them privileges subject to the monopoly of this monopolistic control
[2:16:39.060 --> 2:16:44.060]  of the state. So simple things like being able to get in a car and go somewhere, being
[2:16:44.060 --> 2:16:49.020]  able to get a taxi somewhere, you get a bus somewhere, get a subway somewhere, just be
[2:16:49.020 --> 2:16:54.660]  able to get on a plane somewhere, just to get on a train somewhere. The basic means
[2:16:54.660 --> 2:17:00.380]  of transit and transportation is going from a core fundamentally protected right that
[2:17:00.380 --> 2:17:05.860]  goes that has ancient histories of our ancient liberties, and is being made a conditional
[2:17:05.860 --> 2:17:11.580]  contingent privilege where you could only exercise at the permission of the state.
[2:17:11.580 --> 2:17:17.300]  And now they're saying anal swabs. Yeah, exactly. I mean, where is it going to end that they're
[2:17:17.300 --> 2:17:22.260]  going to keep escalating this to see how much they can have complete control over people
[2:17:22.260 --> 2:17:27.260]  to condition the future generations to see this as normal. And they're not saying that
[2:17:27.260 --> 2:17:31.860]  Buddha judge, it's okay because he's gay. It's just like Tim Cook runs death camps in
[2:17:31.860 --> 2:17:40.740]  China. It's okay. He's gay. Now Buddha judge is going to stick Q tips in your butt. Yeah,
[2:17:40.740 --> 2:17:46.820]  it's insanity. But if it basically their identity politics is the mask by which they it was
[2:17:46.820 --> 2:17:52.420]  it's kind of like you look at the Titanic and the sort of neoliberal class that Biden
[2:17:52.420 --> 2:17:58.220]  is part of basically doesn't want to restructure who's where on the Titanic. They just want
[2:17:58.220 --> 2:18:02.340]  to make that the people that are in first class with protected privilege status that
[2:18:02.340 --> 2:18:07.700]  they have different gender identities, different genders, different races, different ethnicities,
[2:18:07.700 --> 2:18:12.220]  different religions. And somehow that masks the fact that they're still maintaining the
[2:18:12.220 --> 2:18:18.060]  same misallocation of power. Exactly. The pure fascism comes in and they just create
[2:18:18.060 --> 2:18:24.420]  all these little fake joke rights. Correct. It's very much they're using aspects of the
[2:18:24.420 --> 2:18:29.500]  fascistic model from Germany and Italy and World War two aspects. That's the question.
[2:18:29.500 --> 2:18:32.820]  What Hitler have been good at even gay? Like I don't hate gay people. I'm just saying it's
[2:18:32.820 --> 2:18:36.900]  like it's okay if we're your fascists were gay. And it's like, okay, well, if Hitler
[2:18:36.900 --> 2:18:41.180]  was gay, would have been okay. Well, exactly. Like look at Janet Yellen, their whole defense
[2:18:41.180 --> 2:18:45.600]  to the fact that we have this corrupt secretary of the treasury, trying to prevent a free
[2:18:45.600 --> 2:18:51.500]  market and protect the heads, the corrupt hedge funds who helped put the money in for
[2:18:51.500 --> 2:18:56.380]  Biden to get elected president personally enriched her for millions and millions of dollars.
[2:18:56.380 --> 2:19:00.300]  What was their defense? She's a woman. That was their only defense. Their defense was
[2:19:00.300 --> 2:19:06.300]  not that she was not corrupt. Their defense was not that they were not interfering on
[2:19:06.300 --> 2:19:10.900]  behalf of the hedge funds and the Wall Street corrupt actors. But instead it's she's a woman.
[2:19:10.900 --> 2:19:14.780]  So magically that means that she can do it. She wants it very much is Hitler would have
[2:19:14.780 --> 2:19:19.460]  been okay if he had been transgender defense. Exactly. Well, I gotta say she's got a nice
[2:19:19.460 --> 2:19:28.220]  beard though. A judicious no comment. So there's no doubt about these aspects that the system
[2:19:28.220 --> 2:19:35.100]  is trying to grab and seize power, condition the ordinary person's mind to accept that
[2:19:35.100 --> 2:19:40.620]  power as a condition of their public, their personal and public safety so that the in
[2:19:40.620 --> 2:19:45.980]  the future they will see things as normal that today we recognize as unprecedented,
[2:19:45.980 --> 2:19:50.580]  perilous and against their ancient liberties. And that's why it has to be fought back against
[2:19:50.580 --> 2:19:55.580]  at every single level that you say ancient liberties. I mean, the right to travel, the
[2:19:55.580 --> 2:20:00.380]  right to speech. I mean, this is stuff that literally tens of millions of mainly people
[2:20:00.380 --> 2:20:05.340]  in the British Isles fought and died for over their freedoms. And now we're just crapping
[2:20:05.340 --> 2:20:11.020]  it in minutes. I mean, we're just taking giant reserves of freedom and just flushing
[2:20:11.020 --> 2:20:16.120]  it. Exactly. I mean, they're getting people to forfeit and forgo the most basic, most
[2:20:16.120 --> 2:20:21.860]  elemental rights that we have the right to an education, the right to transportation,
[2:20:21.860 --> 2:20:26.340]  the right to express yourself. There's no more core rights than those and all are under
[2:20:26.340 --> 2:20:30.980]  extraordinary threat from this. And you got to go through a Bill Gates global ID will
[2:20:30.980 --> 2:20:35.340]  play the clip when you come back. It's all official. A global ID he and the UN run with
[2:20:35.340 --> 2:20:39.700]  G.G. Ping to be able to even leave your house. I mean, wow, what a criminal action. Where
[2:20:39.700 --> 2:20:43.700]  are the governors? Where are the states? Where is the Senate? Where is the house? We'll be

[2:21:56.740 --> 2:22:01.780]  is standalone with our own radio and TV satellite uplinks at hundreds of stations picking us
[2:22:01.780 --> 2:22:08.060]  up. Almost no one else has that, especially anybody covering real issues of global populism,
[2:22:08.060 --> 2:22:13.740]  the right to self defense and exposing the anti human globalist death agenda. That's
[2:22:13.740 --> 2:22:19.100]  why when we go out and shoot videos, they're at band on video. They're not allowed to be
[2:22:19.100 --> 2:22:24.580]  on Twitter, on YouTube, on Facebook. That's why it's so precious because the censorship
[2:22:24.580 --> 2:22:29.620]  expands to everyone, which he is now with AI monitoring, controlling what you can say
[2:22:29.620 --> 2:22:34.660]  and do. It's going to be the OACs like band on video and the now redesigned info wars
[2:22:34.660 --> 2:22:39.780]  dot com become more and more important, which they are. And the enemy is suing us, attacking
[2:22:39.780 --> 2:22:45.060]  us, hacking us, lying about us, sabotaging us, infiltrating us, trying to shut us down
[2:22:45.060 --> 2:22:50.700]  right now, because they're coming after everyone. So spread the word now. The post industrial
[2:22:50.700 --> 2:22:58.500]  world. That's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21
[2:22:58.500 --> 2:23:05.700]  conference back in 1992. Now they've launched agenda 2030, which is a post industrial world
[2:23:05.700 --> 2:23:10.740]  plows swap the Davos group, Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, they're all on record saying
[2:23:10.740 --> 2:23:17.620]  the great reset is agenda 2030. Well, you might want to find out what agenda 2030 is. It is
[2:23:17.620 --> 2:23:23.300]  the destruction of society as we know it. It is making the population more by designs.
[2:23:23.300 --> 2:23:29.660]  We can be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family. They're destroying
[2:23:29.660 --> 2:23:36.540]  civilization, rebuild it in their dystopic image. We're fighting this at info wars dot
[2:23:36.540 --> 2:23:41.380]  com and news wars dot com. We're fighting for a pro human future. And we need you to
[2:23:41.380 --> 2:23:46.620]  get the facts to research and share with others and join the fight. God bless you. Visit us.
[2:23:46.620 --> 2:24:08.580]  Read the word at info wars dot com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. And it's
[2:24:16.620 --> 2:24:25.420]  all. We are back. I'm your host Alex Jones and we're in the middle of a global corporate
[2:24:25.420 --> 2:24:36.340]  takeover. Whose in game is the population. There is the paradox as the college are pointing
[2:24:36.340 --> 2:24:41.900]  out of the giant awakening happening. Biden national security advisor told Hillary that
[2:24:41.900 --> 2:24:53.340]  Al Qaeda is on our side. Those came out in 2012 statements. So we're Al Qaeda, those
[2:24:53.340 --> 2:24:57.020]  of us that don't want tyranny, the average gun owner veteran, but the people that actually
[2:24:57.020 --> 2:25:01.300]  work with Al Qaeda, they're good guys. Robert Barnes is our guest. We'll take a few calls
[2:25:01.300 --> 2:25:07.220]  next segment. He'll be able to dial into whatever you bring up for people that have been holding
[2:25:07.220 --> 2:25:14.180]  like Larry and Duncan and others that we'll get to. But what about the good news? We see
[2:25:14.180 --> 2:25:18.660]  suddenly McCron saying the vaccine doesn't work. It's basically ineffective, almost
[2:25:18.660 --> 2:25:22.580]  completely ineffective as the quote. Australia's suspending the vaccine because it had so many
[2:25:22.580 --> 2:25:26.780]  problems and deaths. The UK saying don't give it to above 75 don't give it to under 16 don't
[2:25:26.780 --> 2:25:31.940]  give it to pregnant women. You see Merck pulling back and saying we're not putting our vaccines
[2:25:31.940 --> 2:25:36.980]  out now. We had big problems. This thing mutates too much. You can't protect anybody.
[2:25:36.980 --> 2:25:41.900]  I had virologist on 11 months ago saying this. This is known science. So what is Gates and
[2:25:41.900 --> 2:25:45.300]  Fauci and what are they thinking? What do they think they're going to get away with
[2:25:45.300 --> 2:25:49.740]  here? And now Biden, the statements have come out on Meet the Press that they want a five
[2:25:49.740 --> 2:25:54.980]  year lockdown. I mean, this is incredible. A lot of business go all just get bailouts,
[2:25:54.980 --> 2:25:59.940]  but everyone's habituated not to go to your restaurant or you go to your business again.
[2:25:59.940 --> 2:26:05.460]  And then the economy consolidates under the big mega tech. I mean, what are they thinking?
[2:26:05.460 --> 2:26:11.940]  What is your view on their plan? Because they admit this is a corporate hoax, a takeover,
[2:26:11.940 --> 2:26:15.900]  but are these good cracks we're starting to see? Or is this just Macron realizing how
[2:26:15.900 --> 2:26:21.340]  deadly this is? He's hedging his bets. Well, I think that the from the get go, there was
[2:26:21.340 --> 2:26:25.700]  reasons to be worried about the vaccine. Bill Gates acknowledged this when he said that
[2:26:25.700 --> 2:26:29.780]  the only way in which anybody would release a vaccine on this timetable for this kind
[2:26:29.780 --> 2:26:35.620]  of virus would be if they had complete immunity from any liability of any kind. And so the
[2:26:35.620 --> 2:26:40.100]  that was the giveaway that clearly this was not a safe and he said 700,000 will get sick
[2:26:40.100 --> 2:26:46.820]  or die. Exactly. Now, the second problem was you have a contest in my view between Bill
[2:26:46.820 --> 2:26:52.420]  Gates's agenda and some of the government's agenda. Now, as Bill Gates has hijacked effectively
[2:26:52.420 --> 2:26:56.580]  a lot of the public health authorities around the world to push his agenda and his agenda
[2:26:56.580 --> 2:27:02.820]  is mass vaccination all the time to have maximum social control over the scale and the size
[2:27:02.820 --> 2:27:07.300]  of the population, the growth of the population and ultimately the population itself. It's
[2:27:07.300 --> 2:27:12.420]  probably not coincidental that Bill Gates is tied to a range of patent requests for
[2:27:12.420 --> 2:27:16.980]  things like chips and people's bodies that would control currency, control vaccines,
[2:27:16.980 --> 2:27:21.980]  control medication, act as a form of digital identification that probably has those patents.
[2:27:21.980 --> 2:27:27.940]  We have MIT two years ago saying Bill Gates hired us to create chips in the vaccines. But
[2:27:27.940 --> 2:27:33.180]  then he goes on TV last week and whines and calls it evil. What's crazy and evil that
[2:27:33.180 --> 2:27:38.460]  we're saying this because it's exactly what his real agenda is. And everybody who's studied
[2:27:38.460 --> 2:27:42.100]  the man over the last 20 years knows it. You know his father and you know it all the way
[2:27:42.100 --> 2:27:46.660]  back. It's what we've been talking about for over a promo. So it's just a psycho that can't
[2:27:46.660 --> 2:27:49.940]  help it. He's got to do this because he's into controlling and hurting people. I mean,
[2:27:49.940 --> 2:27:53.580]  because what he's doing is so destructive for him. He'll never get out of this. I mean,
[2:27:53.580 --> 2:27:54.580]  this is insane.
[2:27:54.580 --> 2:27:59.300]  Well, I mean, he's upset. He is more driven by control than he is anything else. I mean,
[2:27:59.300 --> 2:28:03.300]  he's like a bond villain, except bond villains might be written in with a better sense of
[2:28:03.300 --> 2:28:08.420]  character and likability than Bill Gates. That's it. He believes thoroughly in his goal
[2:28:08.420 --> 2:28:09.980]  and ideas like a bond villain.
[2:28:09.980 --> 2:28:14.700]  Exactly. And the more he goes public, the more he's hated. He has a 99% negative rating
[2:28:14.700 --> 2:28:19.220]  now. So now they just banned comments, which only pisses people off more.
[2:28:19.220 --> 2:28:24.380]  Well, there's a reason why he's been buying off quote unquote fact checking organizations,
[2:28:24.380 --> 2:28:28.660]  particularly in the public health space and the international news space for years. Because
[2:28:28.660 --> 2:28:33.100]  when he got burned for what he did in India, got burned for what he did in Kenya, got burned
[2:28:33.100 --> 2:28:36.900]  for what he's done in other parts of the world, he recognized he needed to control both the
[2:28:36.900 --> 2:28:42.260]  health authorities and control the press that covers public health. The problem is it's
[2:28:42.260 --> 2:28:46.540]  getting exposed at too many levels. I mean, the the from the get go. This was just like
[2:28:46.540 --> 2:28:52.700]  swine flu 1976, where we rushed through a vaccine, it completely backfired. CBS 60 minutes
[2:28:52.700 --> 2:28:58.540]  even did an expose on it a year later. We've never had a successful coronavirus vaccine
[2:28:58.540 --> 2:29:04.340]  in our meaningful history. Even the flu shot is sporadic in its success rate. So there
[2:29:04.340 --> 2:29:09.940]  was and it usually takes three to four years to even measure safety and effect and effectiveness
[2:29:09.940 --> 2:29:14.700]  and safety, according to them, their own standard. So the idea that we could rush this, this
[2:29:14.700 --> 2:29:19.820]  was an area where Trump, frankly, made a mistake. He compromised, hoping to satisfy the Gates
[2:29:19.820 --> 2:29:24.100]  crew by rushing a vaccine, hoping again, he could use it for reelection to deal with
[2:29:24.100 --> 2:29:28.340]  all these issues. When in fact, that was never going to be a good compromise. You just nailed
[2:29:28.340 --> 2:29:35.700]  it. You just nailed it. The UN came out in December of 2019, a year and a month ago.
[2:29:35.700 --> 2:29:40.420]  And they said, our doctors don't believe it. There's no testing. We're killing people autism.
[2:29:40.420 --> 2:29:44.680]  It's all collapsing. It's wobbly. We've got to go to the foundations to my gates, giving
[2:29:44.680 --> 2:29:50.140]  us this and say, no. So instantly COVID's released to create a too big to fail thing
[2:29:50.140 --> 2:29:54.900]  where he gets everybody to have even bigger waivers. He normalizes death. And then he
[2:29:54.900 --> 2:29:58.820]  just thinks he'll be the hero in the middle of it with it. It's kind of Reddit air blowing
[2:29:58.820 --> 2:30:03.260]  up oil. Well, that's on fire with explosives, but this didn't blow out the flame. It made
[2:30:03.260 --> 2:30:04.260]  it even bigger.
[2:30:04.260 --> 2:30:09.700]  Exactly. And the states are addicted to the power. So what you're seeing now is a conflict
[2:30:09.700 --> 2:30:14.300]  between Bill Gates' agenda, which was to get everybody so miserable that they begged
[2:30:14.300 --> 2:30:19.180]  for a vaccine is the solution. So they conditioned their mind to just take whatever the government
[2:30:19.180 --> 2:30:23.740]  says they want to put in your body in the future against what the states like all these
[2:30:23.740 --> 2:30:28.020]  countries and individual state governments, which is they love the power that they've
[2:30:28.020 --> 2:30:30.900]  been given and that they've got away with it, that the courts have let them get away
[2:30:30.900 --> 2:30:35.460]  with it, that police and sheriffs in many places, not all, but some have a lot, let
[2:30:35.460 --> 2:30:39.780]  them get away with it without even passing the law through the legislature in many instances.
[2:30:39.780 --> 2:30:44.020]  And they love this power so much. That's where they started undermining the vaccine
[2:30:44.020 --> 2:30:47.580]  by saying, oh, actually, the vaccine won't deter transmission. So we get to keep all
[2:30:47.580 --> 2:30:49.780]  of our power and crazy lockdown rules.
[2:30:49.780 --> 2:30:53.660]  You said so. That's why it's schizophrenic. They're like, oh, yeah, take the vaccines
[2:30:53.660 --> 2:30:57.020]  to protect you, but it doesn't really. They were just going to stop showing all the false
[2:30:57.020 --> 2:31:00.860]  positives and say they'd been the savior. So Big Pharma wanted to be the savior, but
[2:31:00.860 --> 2:31:04.700]  they've walked into the trap because the deeper globalist group wants an endless lockdown
[2:31:04.700 --> 2:31:08.380]  and total control. And so they're all fighting with each other now is why none of it even
[2:31:08.380 --> 2:31:09.380]  makes sense.
[2:31:09.380 --> 2:31:14.780]  Exactly. The vaccine boys, Big Pharma and Bill Gates need the vaccine to be the cure
[2:31:14.780 --> 2:31:18.860]  all so that they can condition the human mind to accept whatever Big Pharma wants to put
[2:31:18.860 --> 2:31:23.300]  in their bodies next. While the state needs the vaccines not to be the cure all because
[2:31:23.300 --> 2:31:27.900]  they need a convenient pretext to continue to seize power at a whim whenever, wherever
[2:31:27.900 --> 2:31:32.460]  and however they want to, because this has worked at such a global scale that they even
[2:31:32.460 --> 2:31:36.380]  they couldn't have even imagined this. This is like Hoover's wet dream times 10.
[2:31:36.380 --> 2:31:40.300]  But it said that evil only works. The first few steps doesn't work later. It's coming.
[2:31:40.300 --> 2:31:44.380]  What about the unforeseen? The global awakening that's happening and the fact that people
[2:31:44.380 --> 2:31:47.380]  are getting what the fact that our audience is exploded. This cannot be good for them
[2:31:47.380 --> 2:31:48.380]  long term.
[2:31:48.380 --> 2:31:54.100]  No, the problem is they're going against people's ordinary everyday experience as people's life
[2:31:54.100 --> 2:31:58.980]  experience refutes what these people are saying. Both the Big Pharma side of the equation,
[2:31:58.980 --> 2:32:03.340]  the Bill Gates side of the equation and the status side of the equation. They're recognizing
[2:32:03.340 --> 2:32:07.020]  these rules often make no sense on their own terms. They're recognizing these rules don't
[2:32:07.020 --> 2:32:08.860]  actually produce the health benefit they claim.
[2:32:08.860 --> 2:32:12.220]  I can sit right next to somebody on an airplane, but I got to be six feet apart everywhere
[2:32:12.220 --> 2:32:13.220]  else.
[2:32:13.220 --> 2:32:19.060]  Exactly. And with my intimate other, I'm supposed to wear a mask. I mean, this is ridiculous
[2:32:19.060 --> 2:32:20.060]  stuff.
[2:32:20.060 --> 2:32:23.060]  Another thing when you masturbate, wear one. People go, this doesn't make sense. It's
[2:32:23.060 --> 2:32:26.580]  not supposed to is that a cult wants you to do stupid things. When you join the Marine
[2:32:26.580 --> 2:32:30.460]  Corps, it is a cult, maybe for good, but they literally make you do silly things that don't
[2:32:30.460 --> 2:32:34.340]  make sense. It's to make you stop thinking and do what they say.
[2:32:34.340 --> 2:32:38.040]  Exactly to have a reflexive conformity. And the problem is they're awakening more and
[2:32:38.040 --> 2:32:42.060]  more people to this because they're seeing the signs of it. So you have record numbers
[2:32:42.060 --> 2:32:46.500]  of people questioning, Hey, were vaccines ever really safe and effective? Why is there
[2:32:46.500 --> 2:32:50.940]  special immunities for vaccine makers? Why is it that you label a drug vaccine all of
[2:32:50.940 --> 2:32:55.740]  a sudden supposed to have this magical, mystical quality that has no problems associated with
[2:32:55.740 --> 2:32:59.340]  it? How do these things actually work? Why have they been lying to me? Why did they say
[2:32:59.340 --> 2:33:03.220]  one thing about a mask and another thing about a mask and then a third thing about a mask?
[2:33:03.220 --> 2:33:07.740]  They see this deception in live time. They see the media deceiving in live time and they
[2:33:07.740 --> 2:33:13.140]  see their life experience that they don't know anybody under 50 years old that's healthy.
[2:33:13.140 --> 2:33:17.220]  That's died from COVID. They're like, if this is such a great threat, why is it I don't
[2:33:17.220 --> 2:33:21.100]  know of anyone who's experienced what we do know a bunch of people died who were even
[2:33:21.100 --> 2:33:26.220]  20 years old or 50 years old from the vaccine and it's coming out. That's why I saw gates
[2:33:26.220 --> 2:33:29.820]  and then pull this and they admitted it was a plan to take over. I'm like, how does class
[2:33:29.820 --> 2:33:33.620]  swab and gates think they're not going to be known as savers in this? They're not going
[2:33:33.620 --> 2:33:37.660]  to be safe anywhere. I don't want the violence against them. I just these people are crazy
[2:33:37.660 --> 2:33:43.620]  lunatic control freaks. I mean, swab where Star Trek outfits and it's given holy scrolls
[2:33:43.620 --> 2:33:52.460]  on TV by bizarre cults. We have the technocrats are controlling the food supply, secure your
[2:33:52.460 --> 2:33:57.260]  own safe source of food supply sale. It's the new prices in 2021, but it's the lowest
[2:33:57.260 --> 2:34:01.340]  price for high quality food. You're going to find at info or store.com. The subsection
[2:34:01.340 --> 2:34:05.260]  is prepared with Alex.com. And it's all these globalists do this. And as they hoard the
[2:34:05.260 --> 2:34:10.580]  food and as they prepare, you need to understand that you need 25 year food supply in the last
[2:34:10.580 --> 2:34:14.700]  25 years, one month, three months, six months, one year supplies, and it's the highest quality
[2:34:14.700 --> 2:34:18.740]  you're going to find. And it's just good to have that checkbox taken care of. And you
[2:34:18.740 --> 2:34:22.580]  know, you're getting good food at a very good price. And you know that a small percentage
[2:34:22.580 --> 2:34:26.580]  of it because there's not much profit in this goes to us to fund our operation. So prepare
[2:34:26.580 --> 2:34:31.580]  with Alex.com or info wars store.com. You can find preparing this section there, water
[2:34:31.580 --> 2:34:35.300]  filtration, air filtration. It's all there. The technocrats are getting ready to bring
[2:34:35.300 --> 2:34:38.860]  in all the force GMO and more. It's time to start getting prepared. It starts with self
[2:34:38.860 --> 2:34:42.180]  defense. It starts with being prepared. It starts with horrible food. It starts with
[2:34:42.180 --> 2:34:49.700]  digging in with a long globalist fight. You'll win in the end. We told you it was coming under
[2:34:49.700 --> 2:34:54.820]  the United Nations pilot program in Singapore for eight months. They made citizens wear
[2:34:54.820 --> 2:34:59.620]  bracelets on their arms that makes them a social distance and report them back to cell towers
[2:34:59.620 --> 2:35:05.300]  attract every movement. This is for everybody. The way it gets better. Now France has programs
[2:35:05.300 --> 2:35:10.140]  in their factories, government push and sponsor to make everyone wear actual dog collars.
[2:35:10.140 --> 2:35:14.420]  You can make a social distance and report back to several computers. They're turning
[2:35:14.420 --> 2:35:19.860]  us into a commodity. Human animal clones have been around for 50 years. It's all being announced.
[2:35:19.860 --> 2:35:25.020]  They are literally taking over the life cycle of humans and making us obsolete and big corporations
[2:35:25.020 --> 2:35:29.900]  now play that they own us with these gene therapy systems and patents that they produced. Do
[2:35:29.900 --> 2:35:34.820]  you understand? It is a takeover of the entire species of the genetic level. And now they're
[2:35:34.820 --> 2:35:39.220]  coming with dog collars and they're announcing in public schools in the U. S. Starting next
[2:35:39.220 --> 2:35:44.380]  year it will begin. Did you hear me? Dog collars for your children all based on a hoax, all
[2:35:44.380 --> 2:35:50.780]  based on a lie. Employee wars continue to spread the word and fight back.
[2:35:50.780 --> 2:35:55.220]  President Trump won in a land flight on November 3rd, but the globalists weren't gonna let
[2:35:55.220 --> 2:36:01.100]  that happen. They had to have some way to repudiate the populist movement, emanating
[2:36:01.100 --> 2:36:06.980]  from the United States that spread across the world from the UK to Brazil. They were
[2:36:06.980 --> 2:36:11.860]  desperate. They admitted their own publications. They didn't know what to do. And so they put
[2:36:11.860 --> 2:36:17.820]  out 80 million fake ballots, violated state law, and stole it better than dollars. And
[2:36:17.820 --> 2:36:21.660]  now they're coming after the president. They're coming after you. They're coming after me.
[2:36:21.660 --> 2:36:25.860]  They're shutting everybody off the internet. They're trying to totally censor us. And that's
[2:36:25.860 --> 2:36:30.300]  why M4 Wars is still in the fight because we knew this was coming. We told you this
[2:36:30.300 --> 2:36:35.540]  was coming. We were the first main target and we're still on air at m4wars.com and newswars.com
[2:36:35.540 --> 2:36:39.420]  and band on video. Without your word of mouth, without your prayer, without your financial
[2:36:39.420 --> 2:36:43.940]  support, we can't stay on air. So while you still can, go to m4warsstore.com and get
[2:36:43.940 --> 2:36:49.820]  storeable foods, my quality products, supplements, you name it, at m4warsstore.com.
[2:36:49.820 --> 2:36:53.980]  I've got some bad news. Our best-selling vitamin mineral fusion has sold out because people
[2:36:53.980 --> 2:36:57.900]  understand in these stressful times, it's now more important than ever to boost your
[2:36:57.900 --> 2:37:03.940]  body's natural defenses. But here's the good news. Pumeric acts in very similar ways and
[2:37:03.940 --> 2:37:08.180]  is so good for inflammation, so good for your immune system. And we've got two great
[2:37:08.180 --> 2:37:14.020]  turmeric formulas. One is body's ultimate turmeric formula that is a dried turmeric extract,
[2:37:14.020 --> 2:37:19.340]  95% humanoid. People love it. That's selling out. But despite that, it's still discounted
[2:37:19.340 --> 2:37:24.660]  in m4warsstore.com. And then also selling out this week is our liquid turmeric extract.
[2:37:24.660 --> 2:37:29.180]  It's called liquid turmeric extract. People really love it. It's extremely strong as
[2:37:29.180 --> 2:37:34.220]  well. It's selling out. And your purchase doesn't just help yourself and your body. It also
[2:37:34.220 --> 2:37:38.340]  funds the m4war and keeps us on air while they're trying to shut everybody down. So
[2:37:38.340 --> 2:37:43.580]  thank you all for your support. Please visit m4warsstore.com and find so many other great
[2:37:43.580 --> 2:37:48.220]  items that will enrich yourself and your family's life and fund the m4war. God bless
[2:37:48.220 --> 2:38:17.060]  and good luck. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:38:17.060 --> 2:38:22.260]  We have a lot of backup servers and big infrastructure systems because we're not allowed on any of
[2:38:22.260 --> 2:38:26.940]  the other big, big, giant platforms. We had to build our own things and leave it at that.
[2:38:26.940 --> 2:38:31.900]  We also have a radio satellite that cost us for how much we do it every year, over $100,000,
[2:38:31.900 --> 2:38:38.180]  like $150,000. They have a TV satellite that reaches all of North America, parts of Europe,
[2:38:38.180 --> 2:38:42.580]  hundreds of stations picking it up. We also have a direct HD feed we send stations with
[2:38:42.580 --> 2:38:48.700]  not only about 50 or so picked that up, over 200 cable and TV stations pick up the satellite.
[2:38:48.700 --> 2:38:52.180]  But a lot of those folks are new listeners. They don't really buy anything. It's okay.
[2:38:52.180 --> 2:38:55.460]  But we hear about it. We get word of mouth about it. And then a lot of the stations stream
[2:38:55.460 --> 2:39:00.620]  their own internet. So it's hard for them to shut us down. We're number one on cloud TV.
[2:39:00.620 --> 2:39:06.060]  We're number one on a bunch of other services we haven't been taken off of. Number one, I
[2:39:06.060 --> 2:39:11.140]  just signed a $300,000-year contract for the radio satellite for another year. It'll
[2:39:11.140 --> 2:39:15.780]  be $200,000 if I signed a two-year. I mean, that's what your money does here. It takes
[2:39:15.780 --> 2:39:22.620]  a lot of cold, hard cash. Because, again, if you've got a cell phone, cost you $500
[2:39:22.620 --> 2:39:26.260]  or whatever, it's an incredible supercomputer. It dials into trillions of infrastructure the
[2:39:26.260 --> 2:39:31.420]  globalists have built. We've had to dial in and build our own infrastructure, but let's
[2:39:31.420 --> 2:39:36.220]  be conservative, $20 million a year. Okay, nobody else did this. And that's why we're
[2:39:36.220 --> 2:39:40.020]  still here. Everybody else has shut down. So thank you for supporting us. But people
[2:39:40.020 --> 2:39:42.860]  are like, why are you plugging? Why do you have ads? Well, we're on commercial radio,
[2:39:42.860 --> 2:39:45.860]  but that's 14 minutes of ads an hour. If we wouldn't have been on that, we would have
[2:39:45.860 --> 2:39:50.340]  been shut down three years ago when they took us off everything. So the fact that I'm still
[2:39:50.340 --> 2:39:56.340]  low-tech, one-foot and low-tech, one-foot and high-tech is the grace of God that we did
[2:39:56.340 --> 2:40:00.500]  this. Because I'll always use any venue I can to reach people. I pay $12,000 a month
[2:40:00.500 --> 2:40:06.340]  for WWCR to reach the third world, those global. I don't make any money off that. It's a cost.
[2:40:06.340 --> 2:40:12.020]  My mission is use business to finance the revolution, not just make money. If I want to make money,
[2:40:12.020 --> 2:40:15.780]  I can sign a $100 million deal at least last time they offered me to sell it to the globalist.
[2:40:15.780 --> 2:40:18.660]  People say, oh, we'll expose that. Well, it was an off the record meeting. It wasn't
[2:40:18.660 --> 2:40:26.060]  illegal. $100 million. That means no employees, $100 million to Alex Jones to start. They
[2:40:26.060 --> 2:40:33.340]  buy people like kids buy baseball cards. I'm not for sale. I'm only for sale for God
[2:40:33.340 --> 2:40:38.180]  truth. That's why buy the products at infowarstore.com. Spread the word about this broadcast because
[2:40:38.180 --> 2:40:44.380]  any day can be our last. We are in a serious globalist takeover. And so all I can offer
[2:40:44.380 --> 2:40:48.700]  you is the truth. Nothing more. infowarstore.com. Get the books, get the films, get the t-shirts.
[2:40:48.700 --> 2:40:53.260]  Now, get Ultra 12. It's back in stock. So good for your immune system. 50% off. DNA
[2:40:53.260 --> 2:40:58.100]  Force Plus is about to sell out infowarstore.com. The liquid ultimate turmeric. It's about to
[2:40:58.100 --> 2:41:02.980]  sell out. Our powdered turmeric has sold out. Lung cleanses back in 50% off. Barnes, I want
[2:41:02.980 --> 2:41:06.740]  to go to some calls. They've been really patient, but I don't think the listener understands
[2:41:06.740 --> 2:41:10.220]  that there's not much infrastructure for independent media out there. And I've actually tried to
[2:41:10.220 --> 2:41:14.460]  build this infrastructure for others. It's just that patriots are so independent, everybody
[2:41:14.460 --> 2:41:17.780]  wants to do their own thing, which is fine. But we're rapidly approaching a moment of
[2:41:17.780 --> 2:41:21.580]  Congress and the states don't act where they're they're not taken down parlor, they're taken
[2:41:21.580 --> 2:41:27.500]  down telegram, they're taking down anything independent. This is a purge.
[2:41:27.500 --> 2:41:30.660]  No doubt about that. They don't want independent information to be available when info wars
[2:41:30.660 --> 2:41:35.780]  has been the template for how people can continue to have a free press, how people can have
[2:41:35.780 --> 2:41:41.700]  free speech and how people can be able to support independent ideas outside of these
[2:41:41.700 --> 2:41:45.820]  institutional gatekeepers who want to keep and force everything within the gates and
[2:41:45.820 --> 2:41:51.860]  anything that's not OK is going to be expelled and not allowed back in ever again. And the
[2:41:51.860 --> 2:41:55.900]  template that info wars has been able to do is critical for people to be able to reuse
[2:41:55.900 --> 2:42:01.260]  to replicate in the future. Maybe one of the only mistakes the system made was going after
[2:42:01.260 --> 2:42:06.660]  info wars, someone that can fight back in a smart, intelligent manner and thus blaze
[2:42:06.660 --> 2:42:11.420]  the path for other people to do the same thing. Now that they're all under assault, we see
[2:42:11.420 --> 2:42:15.380]  the contrast. I mean, parlor disappeared overnight, thought they had legal protection
[2:42:15.380 --> 2:42:18.740]  that they didn't thought they had political protection that they didn't thought they had
[2:42:18.740 --> 2:42:23.460]  technological protection that they did. It's because of the info wars audience that this
[2:42:23.460 --> 2:42:28.500]  method and mechanism of being able to maintain and sustain the the biggest independent free
[2:42:28.500 --> 2:42:33.060]  press in the world has been around. And I'm glad you say that because when I sit there
[2:42:33.060 --> 2:42:37.780]  and say we're still standing, I'm like a guy in the ring round 12 of Muhammad Ali. I am
[2:42:37.780 --> 2:42:42.060]  not sitting here saying I'm tough. You know what? And boy, I didn't know it's all you folks.
[2:42:42.060 --> 2:42:47.140]  I'm hanging on the ropes with blood coming out every every part of my face. But the other
[2:42:47.140 --> 2:42:51.980]  guys beat the hell too. And so I'm just saying folks keep us in the fight pray for us because
[2:42:51.980 --> 2:42:56.260]  we're one of the last people standing right now. It's like the GameStop Redditors, they
[2:42:56.260 --> 2:43:00.740]  were they use the South Park meme where the guys coming out and said, I didn't hear any
[2:43:00.740 --> 2:43:04.620]  bell, even though he's beat up, he's more the other side, the hedge funds are even more
[2:43:04.620 --> 2:43:09.260]  beat up. And it shows the sign of the populist revolution of people taking technology into
[2:43:09.260 --> 2:43:13.340]  their own hands and looking at go, you don't have to read, you don't have to recreate the
[2:43:13.340 --> 2:43:17.380]  wheel. The wheels are already been created. That's why I always recommend people support
[2:43:17.380 --> 2:43:22.140]  info wars because it helps. Well, here's an example. Here's an example. 10 years ago,
[2:43:22.140 --> 2:43:26.340]  then I'm going to cause or 12 years ago, we got dropped by there was only three satellite
[2:43:26.340 --> 2:43:32.260]  carriers, ABC, Clear Channel and Jones. And no relation to me. Clear Channel dump this
[2:43:32.260 --> 2:43:36.300]  evening I was paying, you know, 10 grand a month or whatever it was the satellite. And
[2:43:36.300 --> 2:43:40.860]  then ABC kicked us off the media spun that Oh, he's with ABC. Well, yeah, it's like saying
[2:43:40.860 --> 2:43:45.100]  we're the AT&T if you call it an AT&T phone, I paid for the service. They took it away
[2:43:45.100 --> 2:43:51.140]  from me. Jones didn't kick us off. And then later was other satellites were on now. But
[2:43:51.140 --> 2:43:55.180]  I learned because the radio network I was on was being kicked off because they were
[2:43:55.180 --> 2:43:59.740]  carrying me. I had to go pay for it myself and learn people how the hell do you know
[2:43:59.740 --> 2:44:04.020]  how to do all this? They made us do it. So what Nietzsche said was true. That which doesn't
[2:44:04.020 --> 2:44:09.660]  kill you only makes you stronger. Absolutely. And so the reason why I recommend people use
[2:44:09.660 --> 2:44:14.140]  support info wars info wars store.com. You can get healthier, wealthier and wiser because
[2:44:14.140 --> 2:44:19.700]  it's a model for everybody. The like, for example, the people out there are complaining
[2:44:19.700 --> 2:44:24.700]  about certain aspects of some of these new technology, technology platforms count cost
[2:44:24.700 --> 2:44:29.500]  some degree of money, $2, $5, $10, whatever it is. The problem is people have been paying
[2:44:29.500 --> 2:44:33.740]  money and not recognizing it because they've been giving up their privacy, given up their
[2:44:33.740 --> 2:44:38.180]  belief systems, subjecting themselves to censorship and suppression. That's the cost. And that's
[2:44:38.180 --> 2:44:44.020]  a much higher cost. The compared to having an honest pricing mechanism upfront. And the
[2:44:44.020 --> 2:44:47.820]  utility with info wars is you're able to buy products that you want, that you need that
[2:44:47.820 --> 2:44:53.020]  make you healthier, that make your life easier. While supporting this independent and that's
[2:44:53.020 --> 2:44:58.140]  the key. Let's just understand we have to pay and which is fine. Every damn thing, every
[2:44:58.140 --> 2:45:02.540]  chain we have to pay. When you're on with big tech, you just get it all. He's dialing.
[2:45:02.540 --> 2:45:07.820]  It's all there. You think it's all. No, it's warehouses of equipment, satellites, uplinks,
[2:45:07.820 --> 2:45:12.780]  encoders, these scramblers, you know, it's a damn mess. And if I couldn't do without
[2:45:12.780 --> 2:45:17.420]  these great engineers, I understand that's what's so scary as other people are sitting
[2:45:17.420 --> 2:45:21.660]  ducks. Let's take a phone call. Robert Barnes really appreciate everybody patiently holding
[2:45:21.660 --> 2:45:29.460]  Duncan in Washington. You're awesome. Go ahead, Alex. Hey, there is systematic evil
[2:45:29.460 --> 2:45:36.100]  in this world. What's required now is systematic accountability of the trade traders in our
[2:45:36.100 --> 2:45:41.700]  nation. I agree lack of accountability. I meant to start the show today with the fact that
[2:45:41.700 --> 2:45:45.740]  globalists are unaccountable and operate through public politicians is why they're so reckless.
[2:45:45.740 --> 2:45:51.140]  Keep going. A week, probably the end of October, about
[2:45:51.140 --> 2:45:57.420]  a week before the election, I had asked you regarding the on air committee of correspondence
[2:45:57.420 --> 2:46:02.820]  following the pattern of the founders and you mentioned you would do that after the election.
[2:46:02.820 --> 2:46:09.020]  I think what we needed a group of I hate to use the word experts because that word doesn't
[2:46:09.020 --> 2:46:16.780]  mean anything anymore. But people like like Robert Barnes, Joel Scowles and Dr. Edwin
[2:46:16.780 --> 2:46:22.860]  Vieira, Stuart Rose, Edward, G Edward Griffith. I agree. We have to start organizing committees
[2:46:22.860 --> 2:46:27.020]  of correspondence to launch new Declaration of Independence and I appreciate you're holding
[2:46:27.020 --> 2:46:30.460]  to say that. Barnes, speak to that. You agree with me last week that a new Declaration of
[2:46:30.460 --> 2:46:34.780]  Independence with some senators, with some governors to let the people say they agree
[2:46:34.780 --> 2:46:39.540]  with it. That's the beginning of a real, not succession, but a reconstitution of the
[2:46:39.540 --> 2:46:43.500]  old Republic. No doubt. In fact, I mean, under Article 5,
[2:46:43.500 --> 2:46:47.060]  you can have a convention of the states. Actually, I think 27 states have already approved it.
[2:46:47.060 --> 2:46:50.380]  I think there's only seven more that would be required. And basically, there are areas
[2:46:50.380 --> 2:46:55.380]  that need clarity that shouldn't need clarity, but frankly do because of our existing politicians
[2:46:55.380 --> 2:47:01.180]  in our constitutional Republic. And that includes a protection from private monopolies who take
[2:47:01.180 --> 2:47:06.260]  over the public square. That includes limitations on politicians and what they can do, whether
[2:47:06.260 --> 2:47:11.060]  it's insider dealing or other methods of corruption. That includes the ability to have term limits,
[2:47:11.060 --> 2:47:14.380]  the ability to have more direct democracy in a sense of referendums and initiatives
[2:47:14.380 --> 2:47:17.340]  and the right of recall of politicians who lie to get to all.
[2:47:17.340 --> 2:47:22.260]  Let me ask you this. How do you challenge a institutional corporate governmental rape,
[2:47:22.260 --> 2:47:26.580]  a move against the people, a consolidated authoritarian takeover? Because this is a
[2:47:26.580 --> 2:47:31.900]  revolution. We're facing a revolution. Well, look at how the Info Wars model was built.
[2:47:31.900 --> 2:47:35.700]  And we saw it replicated just last week in the biggest revolution and revolt against
[2:47:35.700 --> 2:47:40.980]  Wall Street and Wall Street history. It's taking all of our individual power, collectively
[2:47:40.980 --> 2:47:46.300]  aggregating it, and then using it, leveraging it. And that's what all those Redditors did.
[2:47:46.300 --> 2:47:51.020]  They just did what keeps Info Wars around. It's purely solely wholly its audience, supporting
[2:47:51.020 --> 2:47:56.340]  it and keeping it alive to maintain independent means of communication, publication and information.
[2:47:56.340 --> 2:48:00.580]  Well, that's all the Redditors did. They just formed a little board. They decided to discuss
[2:48:00.580 --> 2:48:04.940]  it. They decided to leverage their power. And what did they do? They brought to them
[2:48:04.940 --> 2:48:10.220]  some of the most corrupt, most pernicious, nasty hedge fund Wall Street business entities
[2:48:10.220 --> 2:48:14.980]  in the world to their knees within a week. So that's what the people, the people can
[2:48:14.980 --> 2:48:18.260]  continue to leverage their individuality. I totally agree. Stay there. A few more calls
[2:48:18.260 --> 2:48:21.860]  from Martin and Paul Watson takes over. But think about that. Think about it. And if people
[2:48:21.860 --> 2:48:25.020]  say, oh, well, they'll kill it in the end. It doesn't matter. It's our exercise of power
[2:48:25.020 --> 2:48:29.020]  that matters. This isn't about money. This is about taking these globalists attached so
[2:48:29.020 --> 2:48:37.980]  they aren't as out of control. It's about war. We'll ride back. Stay with us.
[2:48:37.980 --> 2:48:40.900]  The best product. I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now. If you
[2:48:40.900 --> 2:48:45.180]  haven't tried Turbo Force, you need to try it. I've tried Turbo Force with everything.
[2:48:45.180 --> 2:48:49.540]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put Turbo Force in my coffee. That was a
[2:48:49.540 --> 2:48:53.300]  crazy week. I don't remember sleeping. But as far as the products go, Turbo Force is
[2:48:53.300 --> 2:48:57.100]  my favorite and all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking
[2:48:57.100 --> 2:49:02.820]  control of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you. Nobody wakes up in
[2:49:02.820 --> 2:49:07.180]  the morning and thinks, I'm going to give that person over there a better life. I'm
[2:49:07.180 --> 2:49:10.500]  going to wake up today. You know what? I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make
[2:49:10.500 --> 2:49:14.260]  that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer. I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari
[2:49:14.260 --> 2:49:17.380]  and a girlfriend. I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've
[2:49:17.380 --> 2:49:20.860]  never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve
[2:49:20.860 --> 2:49:24.140]  your life in every single way? There's only one person who woke up and fought that, and
[2:49:24.140 --> 2:49:27.740]  that was me. I woke up and thought, you know what? Okay, I want to take control of my life.
[2:49:27.740 --> 2:49:30.820]  I want to take control of my health. And that's why you need to go to Infowars.com, take control
[2:49:30.820 --> 2:49:34.340]  of your health right now and support the resistance. Don't buy into the group thing. Don't drink
[2:49:34.340 --> 2:49:38.820]  the Kool-Aid. Drink the Turbo Force. Kool-Aid's bad and the Turbo Force is good.
[2:49:38.820 --> 2:49:45.860]  Globalists are taking control of the entire human genome. They are forcing mutations.
[2:49:45.860 --> 2:49:51.020]  This is forced evolution or de-evolution. When you look at all the major research, all
[2:49:51.020 --> 2:49:55.420]  the major programs they're carrying out, they are not to produce people that are smarter
[2:49:55.420 --> 2:50:00.820]  or folks that live longer or are more moral. No, it's turning humanity into a commodity.
[2:50:00.820 --> 2:50:06.140]  Now we see some propaganda like Communist China bragging, hey, we've done mRNA vaccines
[2:50:06.140 --> 2:50:11.300]  to make our soldiers superman. That's a way to make it sexy that, hey, we're experimenting
[2:50:11.300 --> 2:50:16.060]  on our troops. We'll sand things with that into our troops, and thousands and thousands
[2:50:16.060 --> 2:50:20.940]  of die each time they try a new experimental vaccine. I've talked to high-level folks inside
[2:50:20.940 --> 2:50:24.460]  the federal government and the state of Texas health department. They say Alex, you know,
[2:50:24.460 --> 2:50:29.100]  it hurts a lot of people, but it's for a greater good. But that's not even true. And it violates
[2:50:29.100 --> 2:50:33.660]  the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code, federal and state law. This is violence being
[2:50:33.660 --> 2:50:37.500]  carried out against us by the medical charity. And we have a right to resist it with any
[2:50:37.500 --> 2:50:42.500]  means necessary.
[2:50:42.500 --> 2:51:11.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:51:11.500 --> 2:51:34.980]  Thank you for taking my call Alex. It's really, I wasn't going to bring this up, but you've
[2:51:34.980 --> 2:51:42.060]  been talking enough about the technology and how it's been crushed and how the ability
[2:51:42.060 --> 2:51:46.180]  to communicate has been crushed. One of the things that I've been wondering here for months
[2:51:46.180 --> 2:51:51.060]  as I'm listening to you and what you went through, because you went through it early,
[2:51:51.060 --> 2:52:00.100]  is there a way that info wars can be a vehicle to help basically the info warrior patriots
[2:52:00.100 --> 2:52:05.100]  do some coordination and communication?
[2:52:05.100 --> 2:52:12.500]  I guarantee you in one week we'd have a devastating way for him to reach the whole world, be the
[2:52:12.500 --> 2:52:17.340]  president of the world, and counter and turn the whole thing. That's why they had the number
[2:52:17.340 --> 2:52:21.700]  one mission two years ago, he was keep Alex Jones away from Trump, because every time
[2:52:21.700 --> 2:52:27.180]  I talk to him, I'm bragging it actually happened. And so yeah, my big thing is capital. I have
[2:52:27.180 --> 2:52:31.740]  enough money to pay the taxes and run the operation, but never really expand. And then
[2:52:31.740 --> 2:52:37.260]  if I could get tied in with Trump, or tied in with any other big resistance operation,
[2:52:37.260 --> 2:52:41.020]  we could turn things around very, very quickly. The globalists have committed such crimes.
[2:52:41.020 --> 2:52:45.180]  I would start with Klaus Schwab and Gates saying we want to depopulate. COVID has meant
[2:52:45.180 --> 2:52:50.980]  to make you poor for carbon tax. Tie it to that. Presentation day one of COVID being
[2:52:50.980 --> 2:52:57.580]  a fraud. And Trump admitting he got conned. Day two showing that China Joe's a Chinese
[2:52:57.580 --> 2:53:00.820]  agent. Day three show the election fraud. But I wouldn't hit him election fraud up front.
[2:53:00.820 --> 2:53:05.660]  I would hit him with they're the enemy of America. Barnes, you got any points on that?
[2:53:05.660 --> 2:53:10.660]  I think moving forward, it's building cross party cross ideological alignments. Like what
[2:53:10.660 --> 2:53:15.260]  I'm doing with Robert Kennedy Jr. to take on the compelled and coerced vaccines, the
[2:53:15.260 --> 2:53:19.860]  medical Sharia law, the invasion of people's privacy, conditioning employers. There's
[2:53:19.860 --> 2:53:23.700]  an employer in the state of Texas. Apparently that's going to be one of the first employers
[2:53:23.700 --> 2:53:28.500]  that to compel people to take a vaccine as a condition of employment, even for people
[2:53:28.500 --> 2:53:33.300]  that are legally exempt from the vaccine because of your doctor says it'll make you sick and
[2:53:33.300 --> 2:53:37.420]  you shouldn't take it. They're going to try to force it. Exactly. And so we have to build
[2:53:37.420 --> 2:53:42.020]  a, a complete cross party, cross ideological attack, like what we saw Wall Street bets
[2:53:42.020 --> 2:53:46.060]  do against the Wall Street hedge funds. They built the biggest hedge fund in the world
[2:53:46.060 --> 2:53:50.460]  by just collectively aggregating individual power and influence. So that everybody can
[2:53:50.460 --> 2:53:55.420]  do the same thing. We can take, find the parts of our life where we can also where they
[2:53:55.420 --> 2:53:58.620]  had people die of the vaccine. The cops said, we don't care about liability protection.
[2:53:58.620 --> 2:54:02.700]  That's civil. This is criminal. This is like, you know, well, they pass a law that you can
[2:54:02.700 --> 2:54:06.500]  drink Drano. If somebody gives it to you, they're liable. So, so this is starting to
[2:54:06.500 --> 2:54:13.020]  come out. Anything else Larry? I actually did. And one of the things that it was a little
[2:54:13.020 --> 2:54:18.900]  bit from yesterday's conversation with Mr. Barnes, but what if President Trump does take
[2:54:18.900 --> 2:54:25.780]  advantage of the opportunity he never really got to talk about the election? And if he's
[2:54:25.780 --> 2:54:30.700]  able to actually provide, you know, maybe he brings in, you know, the Supreme Court
[2:54:30.700 --> 2:54:36.740]  Council from Italy and makes a compelling case that that, that election was stolen.
[2:54:36.740 --> 2:54:40.660]  I think Barnes agrees with you is that he should turn this around on them. But I don't
[2:54:40.660 --> 2:54:44.740]  know where these lawyers come from. Why there's such cowards. I appreciate your call. Norm
[2:54:44.740 --> 2:54:47.940]  Pattis, one of your friends, Barnes, just sent me an article. He wrote, he thinks Trump
[2:54:47.940 --> 2:54:51.620]  might lose with what his lawyers filed. I mean, you said it's not as good as it should
[2:54:51.620 --> 2:54:56.460]  be. You think that that's true? I don't think there's much risk of him actually losing
[2:54:56.460 --> 2:55:00.500]  because the Republican Party's not willing to. There's not, they don't have enough suicidal
[2:55:00.500 --> 2:55:04.980]  politically suicidal senators up there. So the Trump has all the lawyers mission is
[2:55:04.980 --> 2:55:07.460]  just to make sure it doesn't embarrass the establishment because they don't want to be
[2:55:07.460 --> 2:55:12.740]  targeted. If they actually defend Trump, they'll get targeted. Exactly. In fact, several of
[2:55:12.740 --> 2:55:16.380]  them started getting targeted as soon as their name was released. So that's just the reality
[2:55:16.380 --> 2:55:19.500]  of it. One of them is a good civil rights lawyer from Alabama. They're trying to remove
[2:55:19.500 --> 2:55:23.980]  him from various boards. So he needed a more fearless, intelligent legal defense than I
[2:55:23.980 --> 2:55:28.580]  think he has presented. But, you know, we'll see that there's strengths and weaknesses
[2:55:28.580 --> 2:55:32.380]  with Trump. We just have to keep trying to reinforce the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses.
[2:55:32.380 --> 2:55:35.280]  All right, go to Twitter, type in Robert Barnes, you'll find him there. He's got some other
[2:55:35.280 --> 2:55:38.940]  platforms as well, host a lot of shows. Barnes, thank you so much for the time. Next week
[2:55:38.940 --> 2:55:43.020]  during the impeachment, we want you to co-host by this. Thank you. Yep, will do. All Joseph
[2:55:43.020 --> 2:55:48.020]  Watson takes over now.
[2:55:48.020 --> 2:55:54.180]  Info Wars is a archetypal classic example of free, independent, organic resistance against
[2:55:54.180 --> 2:56:00.700]  tyranny. You built info wars. You spread the word. You prayed for us. You bought the products.
[2:56:00.700 --> 2:56:06.060]  You called in. You made recommendations. Info Wars is as much yours as it is mine. And that's
[2:56:06.060 --> 2:56:11.380]  why the enemy is so upset that under the de-platforming, under all the DNC lawsuits, under all the
[2:56:11.380 --> 2:56:16.500]  attack, in many ways, we've become stronger. With band.video, redesigned info wars with
[2:56:16.500 --> 2:56:23.980]  all of our great crew, with documentary films and 10 hours of live radio and TV a day, we
[2:56:23.980 --> 2:56:28.900]  are the resistance. You are the resistance. So remember this arsenal of freedom is waiting
[2:56:28.900 --> 2:56:34.340]  for you to continue to spread the word about it and to continue for you to support because
[2:56:34.340 --> 2:56:38.100]  this is something we built together. It's not just a national treasure. It's a treasure
[2:56:38.100 --> 2:56:42.460]  worldwide against the tyrants and they know it and they can't stand it. And as everything
[2:56:42.460 --> 2:57:04.100]  we talked about comes true, our credibility only goes up together. So I salute you all.
[2:57:04.100 --> 2:57:13.380]  So everybody, we are live. This is the summit news hour where we are asking the question,
[2:57:13.380 --> 2:57:17.260]  are you patriotic enough to take the anal swat? You've heard of Joe Biden's 100 day mask
[2:57:17.260 --> 2:57:22.820]  challenge. You've seen how China's response to the coronavirus pandemic has been praised
[2:57:22.820 --> 2:57:29.620]  all across the board. Well, now China has a more efficient method to test for COVID.
[2:57:29.620 --> 2:57:37.060]  And I don't see why President Joe Biden isn't vehemently encouraging, nay demanding that
[2:57:37.060 --> 2:57:45.300]  you bend over and take the anal swab. Yes, this is actually real. It's not the Babylon
[2:57:45.300 --> 2:57:51.500]  bee. It's not the onion. This is what Chinese people, thousands of them in Beijing, thousands
[2:57:51.500 --> 2:57:58.900]  of them in other cities have been receiving on the receiving end of at least the COVID
[2:57:58.900 --> 2:58:04.340]  anal swab. We're going to get into that a bit later on. We're also going to get into
[2:58:04.340 --> 2:58:11.820]  wokileaks. This is a new insider who's basically a celebrity. I'm not going to reveal much
[2:58:11.820 --> 2:58:16.260]  information about him because the whole point is that it's supposed to remain anonymous
[2:58:16.260 --> 2:58:22.140]  so he can infiltrate these circles, which he's already basically a part of, but infiltrate
[2:58:22.140 --> 2:58:29.660]  them and leak information without being detected without his identity being revealed. And in
[2:58:29.660 --> 2:58:33.580]  fact, the first video has gone up about this, which we're going to play later in the show.
[2:58:33.580 --> 2:58:40.460]  But we're hoping to get him on for an interview over the course of the next week. Basically,
[2:58:40.460 --> 2:58:46.300]  this is a leftist that disagrees with me on basically every issue whatsoever is no fan
[2:58:46.300 --> 2:58:51.980]  of me yet is so shocked at being around these celebrities, these actors, these models, these
[2:58:51.980 --> 2:58:59.060]  political campaigners, and how different their personal lifestyles are to how they broadcast
[2:58:59.060 --> 2:59:05.700]  what they are to the general public on social media. So I'm going to get into that later
[2:59:05.700 --> 2:59:11.740]  in the show, and that is an ongoing thing. I'm going to start with this, though. This
[2:59:11.740 --> 2:59:17.700]  is a headline out of Vir Sky News a couple of days ago. COVID-19 lockdowns and new health
[2:59:17.700 --> 2:59:27.180]  habits help number of flu sufferers fall to 130 year low. Yes, flu has basically disappeared
[2:59:27.180 --> 2:59:33.340]  in the United Kingdom. Oh, gee, I wonder why? There's the number of people suffering from
[2:59:33.340 --> 2:59:42.020]  the flu in England is plunged by more than 95% to levels not seen for 130 years. Data
[2:59:42.020 --> 2:59:48.020]  experts at the Royal College of General Practices said that in the third week of January, usually
[2:59:48.020 --> 2:59:54.740]  a peak time for the flu, the number of flu-like illnesses reported to doctors was 0.9 per 100,000
[2:59:54.740 --> 3:00:00.620]  people compared with a five year average of 27. It's believed that measures designed to
[3:00:00.620 --> 3:00:04.860]  tame the COVID-19 pandemic as well as increased publicity about the importance of having the
[3:00:04.860 --> 3:00:11.140]  flu vaccine are quashing influenza and many other respiratory diseases. Really? They don't
[3:00:11.140 --> 3:00:16.380]  seem to be quashing COVID, do they? Because we had a second wave higher than the first.
[3:00:16.380 --> 3:00:22.820]  So basically, they're pretending here that flu has completely disappeared in being reported
[3:00:22.820 --> 3:00:28.940]  in case numbers in the United Kingdom because of social distancing, because of people washing
[3:00:28.940 --> 3:00:34.700]  their hands because of lockdown. Really? Really? Well, I'm going to flash back to this headline,
[3:00:34.700 --> 3:00:40.780]  which was at the start of the month. Epidemiologists as influenza cases are being counted as
[3:00:40.780 --> 3:00:48.940]  COVID-19. Top epidemiologist, Nutt Witowski, says that the massive drop in influenza cases
[3:00:48.940 --> 3:00:56.260]  can be attributed to the fact that many are being falsely counted as COVID-19 cases. Now,
[3:00:56.260 --> 3:01:02.340]  this is no anti-vaxxer screeching on Facebook. This is the former head of biostatistics,
[3:01:02.340 --> 3:01:08.820]  epidemiology and research design at Rockefeller University, who cautioned that influenza has
[3:01:08.820 --> 3:01:17.020]  been renamed COVID-19 in large part. According to CDC figures, the cumulative positive influenza
[3:01:17.020 --> 3:01:22.380]  test rate from late September into the week of December 29th, December 19th, sorry, was
[3:01:22.380 --> 3:01:29.820]  just 0.2% compared to 8.7% from a year before. So exactly the same phenomenon in the United
[3:01:29.820 --> 3:01:35.700]  States where flu has basically disappeared, it's drastically being reduced, and they're
[3:01:35.700 --> 3:01:41.140]  saying, oh, well, it must be because of lockdown. It must be because of social distancing. It
[3:01:41.140 --> 3:01:48.660]  must be because of people washing their hands. Not according to this epidemiologist who has
[3:01:48.660 --> 3:01:55.420]  come out and said that flu cases are being counted as COVID cases. So therefore, you're
[3:01:55.420 --> 3:02:01.180]  obviously going to get more cases, and you're going to get more fatalities if that flu number
[3:02:01.180 --> 3:02:05.940]  is included in the COVID number, because it's a fact that many old people unfortunately
[3:02:05.940 --> 3:02:13.060]  die from the flu from pneumonia every single year. Now, this ties into another fact, which
[3:02:13.060 --> 3:02:20.260]  now, if I posted this statistic on Twitter or Facebook, I bet they'd remove it. I bet
[3:02:20.260 --> 3:02:27.060]  they'd remove it. And yet it's from the UK government website. It's from the Office of
[3:02:27.060 --> 3:02:32.340]  National Statistics. There was a Freedom of Information Act request, which they have to
[3:02:32.340 --> 3:02:39.980]  respond to, and somebody asked them to provide the following information. One, the number
[3:02:39.980 --> 3:02:46.700]  of people who have died from COVID-19 without any preexisting medical conditions, and two,
[3:02:46.700 --> 3:02:52.060]  the number of people who have died from COVID-19 with preexisting conditions. So this was a
[3:02:52.060 --> 3:02:58.340]  Freedom of Information Act in the UK. The headline on the ons.gov.uk website, again,
[3:02:58.340 --> 3:03:05.700]  government website, is COVID-19 deaths with and without preexisting conditions. This was
[3:03:05.700 --> 3:03:12.380]  filed on January 20th in response to this Freedom of Information Act request. And it says the
[3:03:12.380 --> 3:03:18.700]  following. Now, they provided the data for coronavirus deaths between March and June
[3:03:18.700 --> 3:03:25.860]  2020. Later on in the statistical release, they're basically refusing to provide data
[3:03:25.860 --> 3:03:33.460]  from July onwards. They may provide it at a later date. But it says the publication
[3:03:33.460 --> 3:03:39.700]  states, and they're citing deaths involving COVID-19 in England and Wales. These are official
[3:03:39.700 --> 3:03:51.460]  government numbers. 50,335 deaths occurred between March and June 2020 involving COVID-19
[3:03:51.460 --> 3:04:03.020]  in England and Wales. So this is between March and June last year. 45,859 of these deaths
[3:04:03.020 --> 3:04:11.820]  were people who had at least one preexisting condition, while 4,476, that's 8.9% of the
[3:04:11.820 --> 3:04:19.220]  deaths had not. So again, it clarifies COVID-19 deaths where there was no preexisting condition
[3:04:19.220 --> 3:04:28.660]  between March and June 2020. Just 4,476 out of 50,000 deaths between those months are
[3:04:28.660 --> 3:04:36.340]  people who died of COVID-19 and only of COVID-19. All the other deaths were people who died
[3:04:36.340 --> 3:04:41.860]  with comorbidities. And this is the point we make over and over again. All people with
[3:04:41.860 --> 3:04:48.460]  serious illnesses, many of whom are in hospital, unfortunately die. They die all the time.
[3:04:48.460 --> 3:04:52.820]  That's not to say that their lives don't mean anything, but it's a fact. And especially
[3:04:52.820 --> 3:05:01.220]  they die at winter. So only 8.9% of people who died, and you can extrapolate that out
[3:05:01.220 --> 3:05:07.380]  for the rest of the deaths that occurred afterwards, only 8.9% of the COVID deaths in England and
[3:05:07.380 --> 3:05:14.620]  Wales were people who died just from COVID. And then understand a lot of those people
[3:05:14.620 --> 3:05:18.900]  will be in an at-risk age bracket. So then if you take out the people below the age
[3:05:18.900 --> 3:05:26.820]  of 50, 60, that number will shrink even more. And then as I just pointed out, they're obviously
[3:05:26.820 --> 3:05:31.660]  including a lot of the flu deaths, a lot of the flu cases in the coronavirus cases. So
[3:05:31.660 --> 3:05:37.380]  that would shrink the number even more. This is on the government's website. They had to
[3:05:37.380 --> 3:05:45.700]  release this. The UK government admits only 8.9% of total COVID deaths were actually COVID
[3:05:45.700 --> 3:05:51.380]  deaths of people who died only with COVID. This is never discussed in the media because
[3:05:51.380 --> 3:05:56.980]  it doesn't fit their narrative. They're fee-amongering consensus. We have this article similar in
[3:05:56.980 --> 3:06:05.060]  the USA, CDC. COVID-19 only cause mentioned in 6% of total coronavirus deaths. So it's
[3:06:05.060 --> 3:06:11.900]  even fewer in the United States. The CDC published an update that acknowledges, quote, COVID-19
[3:06:11.900 --> 3:06:20.180]  was the only cause mentioned in 6% of total coronavirus deaths. So the other 94% of deaths,
[3:06:20.180 --> 3:06:27.460]  they had other co-morbidities, other serious illnesses when they died. It's on the UK government
[3:06:27.460 --> 3:06:33.060]  website. It's on the official CDC website. But we never hear this narrative in the media.
[3:06:33.060 --> 3:06:37.780]  And again, the way they've got the algorithms, the censorship set up on social media, if
[3:06:37.780 --> 3:06:42.700]  I posted these government statistics, they'd probably get removed within a holiday. Don't
[3:06:42.700 --> 3:06:49.340]  go away. Someone's got news for you. I love the Patriot Blend Wake Up America coffee.
[3:06:49.340 --> 3:06:55.420]  I just love it. I can't get enough of it. We've got a fresh brew right now. That's what
[3:06:55.420 --> 3:06:59.740]  fills my mug. That's what fills my belly. That's what fills my soul. Wake Up America

[3:07:10.820 --> 3:07:15.660]  loves it. We drink it every day. And of course, that's just one of the great ways you can
[3:07:15.660 --> 3:07:20.660]  support info wars here. Everybody drinks coffee or just about everybody. Why not support info
[3:07:20.660 --> 3:07:25.380]  wars and keep the coffee supply at your house with the Wake Up America Patriot Blend? Of
[3:07:25.380 --> 3:07:29.140]  course, read all the great reviews. Pretty much perfect review there. 4.9 star. When
[3:07:29.140 --> 3:07:33.420]  you have thousands of reviews, it's impossible to have a perfect review unless literally
[3:07:33.420 --> 3:07:36.780]  everybody gives it five stars. So I mean, if you have 4.9, that's pretty much everybody
[3:07:36.780 --> 3:07:40.660]  who gives it a five star, except maybe one or two people. Patriot Blend 100% organic
[3:07:40.660 --> 3:07:48.660]  coffee only available at infowarsstore.com. We have the technocrats are controlling the

[3:07:54.020 --> 3:07:58.100]  but it's the lowest price for high quality food you're going to find at infowarsstore.com.
[3:07:58.100 --> 3:08:02.060]  The subsection is prepared with alex.com and it's all these globalists do this. And as
[3:08:02.060 --> 3:08:06.900]  they hoard the food and as they prepare, you need to understand that you need 25 year foods
[3:08:06.900 --> 3:08:11.180]  to rely on the last 25 years, one month, three months, six months, one year supplies, and
[3:08:11.180 --> 3:08:15.260]  it's the highest quality you're going to find. And it's just good to have that checkbox taken
[3:08:15.260 --> 3:08:18.700]  care of. And you know, you're getting good food at a very good price. And you know that
[3:08:18.700 --> 3:08:22.300]  a small percentage of it because there's not much profit in this goes to us to fund our
[3:08:22.300 --> 3:08:28.860]  operation. So prepare with alex.com or infowarsstore.com. You can find a pair in the section there,
[3:08:28.860 --> 3:08:32.580]  air filtration, air filtration. It's all there. The technocrats are getting ready to bring
[3:08:32.580 --> 3:08:36.180]  in all the forced GMO and more. It's time to start getting prepared. It starts with self
[3:08:36.180 --> 3:08:39.540]  defense. It starts with being prepared. It starts with horrible food. It starts with
[3:08:39.540 --> 3:08:48.220]  digging in with a long globalist fight. You'll let in the end.
[3:08:48.220 --> 3:09:02.140]  You're listening to the alex jones show. You're listening to the summit.news with Paul Joseph
[3:09:02.140 --> 3:09:12.220]  Watson. So we have the disappearance of flu deaths, the virtual disappearance of flu deaths
[3:09:12.220 --> 3:09:17.020]  in the United Kingdom. And indeed, we've seen a similar effect in the United States. They're
[3:09:17.020 --> 3:09:23.380]  not reporting why that is, which is what epidemiologist Witowski said, as we reported back on January
[3:09:23.380 --> 3:09:27.940]  5th, is because they're including a lot of the flu cases, a lot of the flu fatalities
[3:09:27.940 --> 3:09:33.740]  in the COVID number. That's why it's disappeared from the record books almost. Then you have
[3:09:33.740 --> 3:09:38.980]  the UK government in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. Acknowledging,
[3:09:38.980 --> 3:09:45.380]  admitting and publishing on its own website that only 8.9% of COVID deaths occurred where
[3:09:45.380 --> 3:09:52.540]  COVID was the only cause of death listed on the death certificate. The rest of them had
[3:09:52.540 --> 3:09:57.740]  serious illnesses. Then as the point I made, if you then account for the fact that a lot
[3:09:57.740 --> 3:10:02.860]  of those people who died only with COVID would have been in the at risk age group category,
[3:10:02.860 --> 3:10:10.820]  that would reduce that number even more. We've had the CDC acknowledge months ago now that
[3:10:10.820 --> 3:10:17.460]  the cause mentioned a coronavirus is only 6% of death certificates. So again, 94% of
[3:10:17.460 --> 3:10:23.820]  coronavirus deaths in the United States had two or three other serious illnesses when they
[3:10:23.820 --> 3:10:30.380]  died. But again, it was listed as coronavirus. There was a meme about somebody getting eaten
[3:10:30.380 --> 3:10:35.540]  by a shark and his cause of death being listed as coronavirus. I think this is an important
[3:10:35.540 --> 3:10:41.260]  topic of conversation. And it's not one that's ever included on the mainstream media. It's
[3:10:41.260 --> 3:10:47.380]  barely even covered. The people who make a point of making this point are called COVID
[3:10:47.380 --> 3:10:53.900]  deniers. They're censored on social media. Yet these are official government numbers.
[3:10:53.900 --> 3:10:59.220]  So the flu cases have disappeared. They're counting them as COVID. 8.9% of deaths in
[3:10:59.220 --> 3:11:05.140]  the United Kingdom are COVID only. 94% of deaths in America. People have two, three other
[3:11:05.140 --> 3:11:11.580]  serious illnesses. None of it is being discussed. What is being discussed now though is whether
[3:11:11.580 --> 3:11:18.820]  you're patriotic enough to take the anal swab headline video anal swabs in China make kids
[3:11:18.820 --> 3:11:26.340]  walk like penguins question mark. Now I saw this footage a few days ago and I don't think
[3:11:26.340 --> 3:11:31.660]  I don't think it's the aftermath of these kids receiving an anal swab. That's not to
[3:11:31.660 --> 3:11:37.820]  say that these anal swabs aren't happening. I made a video about this. It's called How
[3:11:37.820 --> 3:11:43.660]  Much Would You Tolerate? And I go for all the official pronouncements that they're very
[3:11:43.660 --> 3:11:48.820]  proud of the anal swabs, the experts in China. And again, remember the mainstream media,
[3:11:48.820 --> 3:11:54.300]  the WHO. The WHO is in China right now, by the way, saying everything's hunky-dory and
[3:11:54.300 --> 3:11:59.620]  great. There were no mistakes made whatsoever, despite the Communist Party literally telling
[3:11:59.620 --> 3:12:05.740]  the WHO on January 14th that there was no human-to-human transmission of coronavirus,
[3:12:05.740 --> 3:12:10.860]  having known that there was for at least a month before, but you can trust them. The
[3:12:10.860 --> 3:12:15.620]  Chinese state media has denied these videos, but video out of China has emerged pertaining
[3:12:15.620 --> 3:12:20.780]  to show the after effects of COVID anal swabs on children. Video posted to Twitter shows
[3:12:20.780 --> 3:12:24.780]  several kids obviously in discomfort walking like penguins after reportedly undergoing
[3:12:24.780 --> 3:12:31.580]  the procedure. This was tweeted by Jennifer Zeng, who is normally quite reliable, but
[3:12:31.580 --> 3:12:38.020]  obviously she's anti-communist Chinese government because she was pro the whole Hong Kong protest
[3:12:38.020 --> 3:12:44.860]  situation. But others suggested that the video shows the after effects not of anal swabs,
[3:12:44.860 --> 3:12:51.980]  but of circumcision. Now, I saw this video days ago and I don't see what benefit the
[3:12:51.980 --> 3:12:58.820]  Communist Chinese Party would get in showing children waddling like penguins. I don't think
[3:12:58.820 --> 3:13:04.060]  that would encourage other people to take the anal swab. But if they've got them at
[3:13:04.060 --> 3:13:08.420]  cattle prod point, maybe they're going to take the anal swab anyway. The question I've
[3:13:08.420 --> 3:13:13.580]  asked is if Americans can take the anal swab if they will. And if we can trick or fool
[3:13:13.580 --> 3:13:19.620]  someone in the Biden administration to advocating anal swabs, because I think it'll be hilarious
[3:13:19.620 --> 3:13:25.860]  and I think it'll be a good benchmark of exactly how much Americans would tolerate. Because
[3:13:25.860 --> 3:13:33.460]  as I make the point in the video, how much would you tolerate? I did a poll about, I
[3:13:33.460 --> 3:13:40.700]  think it was in 2013 when the whole TSA controversy, the naked body scanners, the groping was really
[3:13:40.700 --> 3:13:45.900]  at the top of the headlines in America for a period of years. It really came to prominence
[3:13:45.900 --> 3:13:54.580]  2010, 2011. And it was still very much in the news as late as 2013, 2014. So I commissioned
[3:13:54.580 --> 3:13:59.980]  a poll with Harris Interactive. This is not some Twitter poll or some Facebook poll that
[3:13:59.980 --> 3:14:06.900]  you can totally gain. This is a proper poll. It costs like $3,000, $4,000 to commission.
[3:14:06.900 --> 3:14:16.060]  Some people were asked if they would take a TSA body cavity probe in order to be allowed
[3:14:16.060 --> 3:14:24.300]  to fly. Meaning, would you let some minimum wage TSA goon literally give you an anal probe
[3:14:24.300 --> 3:14:29.700]  for you to be able to get on an airplane? Now, when Americans were asked this question
[3:14:29.700 --> 3:14:38.060]  back in 2013, 30% of them said yes. So almost a third that they would literally take an
[3:14:38.060 --> 3:14:46.100]  anal probe to be allowed to travel. So how many Americans would take the less invasive
[3:14:46.100 --> 3:14:52.340]  anal swab to be clear of COVID? Now, if they can't get the vaccine, maybe the anal swab
[3:14:52.340 --> 3:14:57.180]  will be required to be allowed to fly, to be allowed to travel on public transport.
[3:14:57.180 --> 3:15:02.300]  Of course, over the weekend, the CDC came out and said you have to wear masks on public
[3:15:02.300 --> 3:15:07.980]  transport. It's now mandatory. If you don't, it may get enforced by somebody on the train
[3:15:07.980 --> 3:15:15.180]  by some official security guard or even the police. And on that subject, zero hedge reports,
[3:15:15.180 --> 3:15:21.220]  double mask, double flip-flop. Are you kidding us all Fauci? We had an article yesterday,
[3:15:21.220 --> 3:15:28.100]  which is about halfway down this article pointing out that Dr. Fauci, less than one week after
[3:15:28.100 --> 3:15:32.140]  advising Americans that wearing two or even three masks would be more effective against
[3:15:32.140 --> 3:15:37.020]  the spread of coronavirus, has now done a complete 180 again and admitted that there's
[3:15:37.020 --> 3:15:43.460]  no data to suggest it will make any difference. So Fauci came out, he said, yeah, you should
[3:15:43.460 --> 3:15:48.740]  probably be wearing two face masks. Then he walked it back, said there's no data. You
[3:15:48.740 --> 3:15:55.620]  should only be wearing one. Well, now he's changed his mind once again. So that 48 minutes
[3:15:55.620 --> 3:16:00.020]  into this Washington Post discussion, Fauci again was asked about double masking. His
[3:16:00.020 --> 3:16:04.940]  response given his recent flip-flop may surprise you. Having said that double masking didn't
[3:16:04.940 --> 3:16:09.020]  make a difference, he appears to flip-flop back saying that the CDC is investigating
[3:16:09.020 --> 3:16:13.820]  whether two masks may be better than one and added that it makes common sense. So he's
[3:16:13.820 --> 3:16:22.180]  flipped back again. Now, what's interesting about this is Newsweek keeps getting content
[3:16:22.180 --> 3:16:27.780]  out of fact checking me only to prove that I'm actually right. They did it with a story
[3:16:27.780 --> 3:16:33.900]  about Facebook banning Bible passages. Facebook did ban Bible passages and they had to come
[3:16:33.900 --> 3:16:39.140]  out after and admit that they did it and then restore the site, the Bible hope site that
[3:16:39.140 --> 3:16:43.860]  they banned. Newsweeks did a fact check and said that was only half true and claimed that
[3:16:43.860 --> 3:16:49.540]  I had said Facebook had banned all Bible passages, which I never said that. Well, now they've
[3:16:49.540 --> 3:16:55.740]  come out and asked fact check. Did Dr. Anthony Fauci advise wearing two masks then reverse
[3:16:55.740 --> 3:17:01.980]  course? And once again, despite the fact that he openly explicitly did do that, they say
[3:17:01.980 --> 3:17:08.940]  that this claim made by yours truly is only half true. Even though he literally did come
[3:17:08.940 --> 3:17:13.820]  out and say, yeah, you should wear two masks, then flip-flop back and said you should only
[3:17:13.820 --> 3:17:19.820]  wear one. Literally the definition of reversing course. So thanks Newsweek for proving me
[3:17:19.820 --> 3:17:25.980]  right once again. Of course, we had another headline, Dr. Tells NBC Americans should consider
[3:17:25.980 --> 3:17:32.980]  wearing four face masks. You're not a double plus good person unless you wear four. Maybe
[3:17:32.980 --> 3:17:37.900]  four is not enough. Maybe you should start thinking about wearing five, six, seven, eight,
[3:17:37.900 --> 3:17:41.980]  nine, 10. Who knows what it's going to be next week. We'll be right back. Summit on
[3:17:41.980 --> 3:18:09.260]  news. Don't go away.
[3:18:09.260 --> 3:18:18.060]  You might want to find out who this super villain is. You see, he believes because he's
[3:18:18.060 --> 3:18:21.980]  hidden playing you and you're not speaking out against it that he has a right to do it
[3:18:21.980 --> 3:18:26.380]  to you. You might want to find out who he works for. He works directly for Prince Charles.
[3:18:26.380 --> 3:18:32.380]  He developed since the 80s the plan for global sustainability. That means worldwide neo feudalism
[3:18:32.380 --> 3:18:37.500]  in his own works. So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize
[3:18:37.500 --> 3:18:44.500]  for you. Take those shots. You might just want to find out who this villain is. All right.
[3:19:07.500 --> 3:19:15.420]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it, but Soros and Bill Gates
[3:19:15.420 --> 3:19:24.220]  and the globalists are on our tail. But the new website is the resistance.video, the resistance.video.
[3:19:24.220 --> 3:19:28.980]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them. So the new
[3:19:28.980 --> 3:19:33.900]  URL that links right to band out video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries
[3:19:33.900 --> 3:19:39.380]  and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is at the resistance.video. Share
[3:19:39.380 --> 3:19:44.380]  the link. The resistance.video. The resistance.video.
[3:19:44.380 --> 3:19:48.480]  I've got some bad news. Our best selling vitamin mineral fusion has sold out because people
[3:19:48.480 --> 3:19:52.420]  understand in these stressful times it's now more important than ever to boost your
[3:19:52.420 --> 3:19:58.460]  body's natural defenses. But here's the good news. Turmeric acts in very similar ways and
[3:19:58.460 --> 3:20:03.020]  is so good for inflammation, so good for your immune system. And we've got two great turmeric
[3:20:03.020 --> 3:20:09.100]  formulas. One is body's ultimate turmeric formula that is a dried turmeric extract 95%
[3:20:09.100 --> 3:20:13.820]  humanoid. People love it. That's selling out. But despite that, it's still discounted
[3:20:13.820 --> 3:20:19.180]  in inforwarstore.com. And then also selling out this week is our liquid turmeric extract.
[3:20:19.180 --> 3:20:23.500]  It's called liquid turmeric extract. People really love it. It's extremely strong as
[3:20:23.500 --> 3:20:28.700]  well. It's selling out and your purchase doesn't just help yourself and your body. It also
[3:20:28.700 --> 3:20:32.980]  funds the inforwar and keeps us on air while they're trying to shut everybody down. So

[3:20:46.300 --> 3:21:02.620]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson
[3:21:02.620 --> 3:21:03.620]  with summit.news.
[3:21:03.620 --> 3:21:10.060]  So for the rest of this segment, we're going to go to this Wokey Leaks video and it's going
[3:21:10.060 --> 3:21:13.980]  to take us through to the end of the segment. This is a celebrity inside of blowing the
[3:21:13.980 --> 3:21:19.740]  whistle on the disgraceful scenes he's witnessed within the confines of the entertainment industry
[3:21:19.740 --> 3:21:26.460]  and what he's going to reveal as a whistleblower going forward. Here is Wokey Leaks.
[3:21:26.460 --> 3:21:35.300]  They're calling it Wokey Leaks. An anonymous celebrity insider who has penetrated the
[3:21:35.300 --> 3:21:40.500]  heart of the entertainment industry and is so revolted by what he's experiencing, he's
[3:21:40.500 --> 3:21:46.020]  decided to become a whistleblower. He's dishing the dirt on the real behind the scenes behavior
[3:21:46.020 --> 3:21:51.220]  exhibited by actors, musicians, models, journalists and professional campaigners. Full disclosure,
[3:21:51.220 --> 3:21:55.620]  I know who this person is. I've met him and I've spoken to it. He is who he says he is
[3:21:55.620 --> 3:22:00.140]  and he does move in these circles in both the UK and the US and hopefully soon we're
[3:22:00.140 --> 3:22:04.660]  going to do an interview where his voice is altered to hide his identity. And no, I haven't
[3:22:04.660 --> 3:22:09.500]  put him up to this. This is a genuine leftist. Somebody who vehemently disagrees with me
[3:22:09.500 --> 3:22:15.060]  on many issues, but what prompted him to spill the beans on his woke acquaintances and what
[3:22:15.060 --> 3:22:20.380]  is he actually saying? It's all explained in a spectator US article in the first part
[3:22:20.380 --> 3:22:25.340]  of what is set to become a regular series, Wokey Leaks. The insider refers to himself
[3:22:25.340 --> 3:22:31.140]  as Dave M. His fallout with the social justice left began when a friend of his started lecturing
[3:22:31.140 --> 3:22:37.020]  him about using POC hand emojis on Instagram, asserting that it was the equivalent of black
[3:22:37.020 --> 3:22:41.380]  face. Yeah, really. This, along with what he was witnessing in the presence of the Woker
[3:22:41.380 --> 3:22:47.420]  Arti at events and parties, left they them so infuriated that he could remain silent
[3:22:47.420 --> 3:22:52.620]  no more from the spectator article. It was after a star studded fundraising dinner when
[3:22:52.620 --> 3:22:57.100]  I watched a group of activists so engrossed in their cokey soliloquies on the refugee
[3:22:57.100 --> 3:23:03.940]  crisis that they left their guest, a Libyan refugee alone outside an expensive private
[3:23:03.940 --> 3:23:09.380]  club unable to get in. It was witnessing the cowardice of an entire social group who completely
[3:23:09.380 --> 3:23:14.540]  abandoned a close friend when he became the subject of a me to allegation that they all
[3:23:14.540 --> 3:23:19.780]  knew to be bogus. They were so afraid of being on the wrong side of a trendy cause that they
[3:23:19.780 --> 3:23:24.740]  all watched in silence as he was mauled by social media mobs that lost his career. And
[3:23:24.740 --> 3:23:30.260]  as they then goes on to highlight, many of these people who adopt social justice causes
[3:23:30.260 --> 3:23:34.820]  don't do it because they actually believe in the cause or want to make the world better.
[3:23:34.820 --> 3:23:39.620]  They do it because they feel guilty. Many of these celebs are only famous because their
[3:23:39.620 --> 3:23:45.620]  parents worked in the same industry or they went to the right school. This is the Oxford
[3:23:45.620 --> 3:23:49.900]  Cambridge set. They had everything handed to them on a silver platter. They didn't have
[3:23:49.900 --> 3:23:54.860]  to graft. Many of them didn't even need to be particularly talented and privately they
[3:23:54.860 --> 3:24:00.580]  feel guilty that their fame is unearned undeserved. And in many cases they're right. I mean have
[3:24:00.580 --> 3:24:05.580]  you seen what passes for comedy on television these days? Their fame is their privilege
[3:24:05.580 --> 3:24:10.220]  and they won't hesitate to weaponize it in order to punch down. To demonize millions
[3:24:10.220 --> 3:24:16.260]  of people who have no privilege as bigots, racists and homophobes. They embody actual
[3:24:16.260 --> 3:24:20.820]  privilege while telling people like me who grew up working class that I should apologize
[3:24:20.820 --> 3:24:26.300]  for my privilege simply for being white. Ironic then that the drive to broadcast to the world
[3:24:26.300 --> 3:24:31.620]  how virtuous they are is actually born out of malevolence and selfishness. These people
[3:24:31.620 --> 3:24:37.460]  are also terrified that if they fail to display enough public loyalty to the woke mob they'll
[3:24:37.460 --> 3:24:43.140]  become the next victim of it. You also see that same pressure in TV movies and art where
[3:24:43.140 --> 3:24:48.540]  a work won't get commissioned unless it carries a social justice message even if it's just
[3:24:48.540 --> 3:24:54.340]  tokenism. Because of social media, never before have so many people been famous. Many friends
[3:24:54.340 --> 3:24:59.660]  of mine have 40,000 plus followers, many of them have close to a million. Of Instagram's
[3:24:59.660 --> 3:25:05.660]  1 billion plus users only 9.1% have fewer than a thousand followers whereas 30% have
[3:25:05.660 --> 3:25:15.380]  between 1,000 and 10,000. 36.7% have 10,000 to 100,000. 19.5% have 100,000 to a million.
[3:25:15.380 --> 3:25:22.300]  And 0.5% have over 10 million. This is a large and entirely new social demographic, a famous
[3:25:22.300 --> 3:25:28.300]  class or famoise if you will. Unlike material wealth there is no tax on this fame and yet
[3:25:28.300 --> 3:25:34.220]  it creates divisions in society and confers advantages to people which are extremely unjust.
[3:25:34.220 --> 3:25:39.540]  It is often very unmeritocratically derived and inordinate number of the famoise have
[3:25:39.540 --> 3:25:44.780]  parents who are also famous. In fact I can't think of a single other industry that is so
[3:25:44.780 --> 3:25:50.980]  nepotistic yet they are almost all strict followers of woke ideology. The character trait
[3:25:50.980 --> 3:25:56.080]  that typically accompanies fame is extreme narcissism. Many friends quickly went musannically
[3:25:56.080 --> 3:26:00.860]  deranged when their social media accounts exploded with followers. I remember being in
[3:26:00.860 --> 3:26:05.860]  the backstage area of a Bernie rally thinking that it felt less like a protest and more
[3:26:05.860 --> 3:26:11.100]  like the green room at a pop concert. People chattered to each other distractedly glancing
[3:26:11.100 --> 3:26:15.820]  every few seconds at their phones or over each other's shoulders for someone more famous
[3:26:15.820 --> 3:26:21.620]  to talk to. Before going on stage to passionately expostulate on the evils of inequality. For
[3:26:21.620 --> 3:26:27.900]  all its supposed utopianism this is a cynically competitive and rigidly hierarchical scene.
[3:26:27.900 --> 3:26:32.460]  Social justice has become a product of social media which itself exists not to make the
[3:26:32.460 --> 3:26:37.940]  world more equal but to make a small number of people in Silicon Valley excessively rich.
[3:26:37.940 --> 3:26:42.660]  He then goes on to expose how many of these race grifters who pose as champions of people
[3:26:42.660 --> 3:26:47.940]  of color are actually bankrolled by moneyed interests that plunder people of color. The
[3:26:47.940 --> 3:26:53.140]  blurring of the lines between social media and social justice was exemplified with excruciating
[3:26:53.140 --> 3:26:59.220]  awkwardness by the patronizing trend of white celebrities giving black celebrities the logins
[3:26:59.220 --> 3:27:04.340]  to their social media accounts. The famous Brit Victoria Beckham layer slightly less famous
[3:27:04.340 --> 3:27:10.700]  Brit June Sarpongo Bee take over her Instagram which will undoubtedly go down with the Montgomery
[3:27:10.700 --> 3:27:15.660]  bus boycotts as a seminal moment in the history of the civil rights movement. The last time
[3:27:15.660 --> 3:27:21.820]  I saw June was in the equality lounge at Davos where guests drank Verve Clico courtesy of
[3:27:21.820 --> 3:27:27.460]  sponsors PWC who had just been exposed for their role in helping Isabel Dos Santos steal
[3:27:27.460 --> 3:27:33.100]  billions from Angola. He then skewers the rampant hypocrisy of woke corporations. The
[3:27:33.100 --> 3:27:38.540]  same kind of companies Nike, Coca-Cola, Apple that will post black squares for black lives
[3:27:38.540 --> 3:27:43.660]  matter that will engage in the most verbose performative moralizing around social justice
[3:27:43.660 --> 3:27:49.060]  issues but then spend millions lobbying against the US ban on imports of products produced
[3:27:49.060 --> 3:27:54.100]  by Chinese slave labor. We are so trapped within the algorithm that we're blind to the
[3:27:54.100 --> 3:27:59.460]  fact that social justice is no longer a political movement but a branding exercise. We are not
[3:27:59.460 --> 3:28:04.300]  activists and revolutionaries but consumers liking and sharing videos and memes about
[3:28:04.300 --> 3:28:09.860]  democracy and equality on phones built by serfs in far away fiefdoms. This is why the
[3:28:09.860 --> 3:28:15.060]  social justice movement has been so rapidly and seamlessly adopted by corporate America.
[3:28:15.060 --> 3:28:19.460]  It's all PR with no action. When you walk into the lobby of Netflix as headquarters
[3:28:19.460 --> 3:28:24.980]  in LA you're greeted by a huge megaphone prop with the words stay woke spray painted across
[3:28:24.980 --> 3:28:30.700]  it. This from a company that edits its content at the request of the Saudi Arabian regime.
[3:28:30.700 --> 3:28:36.380]  I hear nervous misgivings from my fellow citizens of Wulcania. I hear concerned whispers about
[3:28:36.380 --> 3:28:41.980]  the vicious attacks on trans rights heretics like JK Rowling. I hear cautious bitching about
[3:28:41.980 --> 3:28:47.420]  the hypocrisy of fashion influencers who scream for the removal of statues of long dead slavers
[3:28:47.420 --> 3:28:52.020]  while accepting large sums to appear in ads for fashion brands that rely on modern day
[3:28:52.020 --> 3:28:56.980]  slavery to stitch their clothes. But very few of them are willing to speak out against
[3:28:56.980 --> 3:29:02.300]  this phoniness. I get it. You're scared of the online abuse. You're scared of work mysteriously
[3:29:02.300 --> 3:29:08.380]  drying up if you have the wrong opinions. But above all you're scared of being unpopular.
[3:29:08.380 --> 3:29:12.660]  Well now you have woke elites. In addition to what's in the article he also told me
[3:29:12.660 --> 3:29:17.580]  what I've been suspecting all along. That while publicly shaming and calling for the
[3:29:17.580 --> 3:29:23.100]  censorship of anyone who criticizes covid lockdown policies. These sneaky bastards are
[3:29:23.100 --> 3:29:28.260]  out virtually every weekend getting shitfaced at house parties. In direct violation of the
[3:29:28.260 --> 3:29:33.260]  very covid rules they demand everyone else should follow. They then told me about another
[3:29:33.260 --> 3:29:39.420]  lefty who is publicly faking being transgender for the grift. While secretly living the life
[3:29:39.420 --> 3:29:45.100]  of a sex mad heterosexual bachelor. Many such cases. And of course the fact that lefties
[3:29:45.100 --> 3:29:50.100]  are weapons grade hypocrites who performatively broadcast their contrived virtue as part of
[3:29:50.100 --> 3:29:55.380]  a massively dishonest grift. Is nothing new. But to have it confirmed in such colorful
[3:29:55.380 --> 3:30:01.220]  detail can only provide us deeper insights into the phenomenon known as virtue signaling.
[3:30:01.220 --> 3:30:06.140]  As I explained in a previous video there's a very tight correlation between virtue signaling
[3:30:06.140 --> 3:30:11.220]  and narcissistic personality disorders. As opposed to psychopaths the study found that
[3:30:11.220 --> 3:30:16.380]  narcissists are more likely to engage in virtue signaling than victimhood because of their
[3:30:16.380 --> 3:30:22.060]  grandiose view of themselves. And as we know virtue signaling is almost exclusively a behavior
[3:30:22.060 --> 3:30:27.740]  exhibited by leftists. Narcissists manipulate public behavior by feigning concern for left
[3:30:27.740 --> 3:30:34.140]  wing political causes. By fabricating proactive behavior while privately doing nothing or
[3:30:34.140 --> 3:30:44.780]  even the opposite. I'm so sorry. We hear at Info Wars are proud to announce the first
[3:30:44.780 --> 3:30:51.020]  ever Kava Kava root supplement that is now available at InfoWarsStore.com. Kava is one
[3:30:51.020 --> 3:30:55.700]  of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today. Though it has been used
[3:30:55.700 --> 3:31:01.260]  for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects. According
[3:31:01.260 --> 3:31:07.340]  to ancient Samoan legend Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa who they considered
[3:31:07.340 --> 3:31:12.540]  to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe. The Samoan people would drink Kava
[3:31:12.540 --> 3:31:18.140]  tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little. Nowadays Kava is used
[3:31:18.140 --> 3:31:23.580]  around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits. The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones
[3:31:23.580 --> 3:31:29.220]  Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava but other herbs including but not
[3:31:29.220 --> 3:31:35.540]  limited to German Kama milk, organic skull cap and valerian root. We do expect to sell
[3:31:35.540 --> 3:31:42.460]  this new product quickly so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:31:42.460 --> 3:31:48.100]  You must guard your humanity. You must guard your children's humanity. You must guard the
[3:31:48.100 --> 3:31:52.660]  very genetic code of the planet. The globalists have set themselves up as the guardians of
[3:31:52.660 --> 3:31:58.780]  this world. They are the ones that are overriding every genetic system and poisoning the planet.
[3:31:58.780 --> 3:32:04.380]  They are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human on earth to
[3:32:04.380 --> 3:32:09.940]  the GMO crops. And now they've moved on to their main target. Too madly with the mRNA
[3:32:09.940 --> 3:32:17.300]  vaccines which are not vaccines. They are recombinant DNA from aborted cloned fetuses
[3:32:17.300 --> 3:32:25.100]  where they inserted into your genome to take over your body's systems. Go read the actual
[3:32:25.100 --> 3:32:32.340]  inserts for the mRNA vaccines and then remember you've been warned. This is the equivalent
[3:32:32.340 --> 3:32:36.980]  of an alien takeover. Whether it's interdimensional, whether it's little green men, the globalists
[3:32:36.980 --> 3:32:40.980]  are acting like another species that's overtaking us and overriding us. It's all the same in
[3:32:40.980 --> 3:32:43.740]  the end.
[3:32:43.740 --> 3:32:48.540]  There are almost no free independent media infrastructures in the United States, much
[3:32:48.540 --> 3:32:53.900]  less in the entire world. InfoWars stand alone with our own radio and TV satellite uplinks
[3:32:53.900 --> 3:32:59.820]  at hundreds of stations picking us up. Almost no one else has that, especially anybody covering
[3:32:59.820 --> 3:33:05.340]  real issues of global populism, the right to self-defense, and exposing the anti-human
[3:33:05.340 --> 3:33:10.540]  globalist death agenda. That's why when we go out and shoot videos, they're at banned
[3:33:10.540 --> 3:33:16.540]  on video. They're not allowed to be on Twitter, on YouTube, on Facebook. That's why it's
[3:33:16.540 --> 3:33:22.260]  so precious because censorship expands to everyone which it is now with AI monitoring
[3:33:22.260 --> 3:33:27.460]  what you can say and do. It's going to be the OACs, Black Band on Video, and the now
[3:33:27.460 --> 3:33:32.220]  redesigned InfoWars.com that become more and more important, which they are. And the enemy
[3:33:32.220 --> 3:33:37.700]  is suing us, attacking us, hacking us, lying about us, sabotaging us, infiltrating us,
[3:33:37.700 --> 3:33:41.980]  trying to shut us down right now because they're coming after everyone. So spread the word
[3:33:41.980 --> 3:33:42.980]  now.
[3:33:42.980 --> 3:33:48.700]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing
[3:33:48.700 --> 3:33:54.300]  with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative
[3:33:54.300 --> 3:34:00.580]  mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfoWarsStore.com. Studies have
[3:34:00.580 --> 3:34:06.540]  suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease
[3:34:06.540 --> 3:34:12.140]  triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction
[3:34:12.140 --> 3:34:18.580]  in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested
[3:34:18.580 --> 3:34:25.700]  that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[3:34:25.700 --> 3:34:31.860]  and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and
[3:34:31.860 --> 3:34:38.220]  calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for
[3:34:38.220 --> 3:34:46.220]  a friend, family member, or yourself at InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:34:46.220 --> 3:34:53.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:34:53.220 --> 3:35:02.220]  You're listening to Summit.News with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:35:02.220 --> 3:35:11.220]  So you heard the VocalLeaks video in the previous segment. We're going to try and get the guy
[3:35:11.220 --> 3:35:17.460]  on up for coming on. A lot of people are speculating as to who it may be, and they're all completely
[3:35:17.460 --> 3:35:21.900]  wrong thus far, but obviously we're not going to reveal his identity. But again, this is
[3:35:21.900 --> 3:35:26.180]  somebody that I've met, somebody who I know, somebody who I know moves in these circles
[3:35:26.180 --> 3:35:33.420]  and hangs out with all these people, whether it be at Davos-type events or at house parties,
[3:35:33.420 --> 3:35:38.180]  whereas I said in the video, you know, they'll be on Twitter all day scolding people for
[3:35:38.180 --> 3:35:43.980]  criticizing lockdown policies and mask wearing. And the same night, there'll be a giant house
[3:35:43.980 --> 3:35:50.420]  party is getting drunk. Absolutely incredible. In fact, I've been at house parties where
[3:35:50.420 --> 3:35:54.940]  I've had arguments with people who support lockdown policies and say, well, you're here.
[3:35:54.940 --> 3:36:01.700]  You've already lost the argument. So we're going to get plenty more juicy revelations
[3:36:01.700 --> 3:36:07.140]  from VocalLeaks over the next few weeks. And again, we'll try and get him on in disguise
[3:36:07.140 --> 3:36:15.260]  with a voice changer so as not to expose his identity over the next week. Meanwhile, Breitbart
[3:36:15.260 --> 3:36:22.100]  reports UK government scientific advisor predicts annual coronavirus vaccine. So again, there's
[3:36:22.100 --> 3:36:26.740]  no getting back to normal. This is the new normal. They're now saying the South African
[3:36:26.740 --> 3:36:34.220]  strain has mutated once again. Maybe the vaccines aren't going to cover that. Now, a senior figure
[3:36:34.220 --> 3:36:37.940]  from the UK government's Immunization Committee predicts that Britons will have to have annual
[3:36:37.940 --> 3:36:44.900]  coronavirus vaccines as the Chinese coronavirus mutates into different strains. So once again,
[3:36:44.900 --> 3:36:49.580]  they claim they weren't developing this vaccine passport. Countries across the world are now
[3:36:49.580 --> 3:36:55.420]  developing it. Airlines are saying that you'll have to prove you've had the vaccine to fly.
[3:36:55.420 --> 3:37:02.260]  Then they'll probably expand that to trains, to taxis, every form of public transportation.
[3:37:02.260 --> 3:37:08.620]  And again, it's about having you in the system. One guy who wasn't in the system was this
[3:37:08.620 --> 3:37:14.820]  fella, UK COVID cops arrest man for handing out free soup. Oi mate, have you got a license
[3:37:14.820 --> 3:37:21.020]  for that soup? No, we didn't. That was literally the reason they arrested him. Despite the
[3:37:21.020 --> 3:37:27.300]  fact that he cited this exemption, which is in the UK coronavirus law, where you can
[3:37:27.300 --> 3:37:34.820]  actually meet with people, God forbid, up to 15 people you can gather, the government
[3:37:34.820 --> 3:37:40.580]  will let you meet people either indoors and outdoors. If you say you're volunteering,
[3:37:40.580 --> 3:37:45.820]  if you're helping to feed the homeless, that's what this guy was doing. He'd been handing
[3:37:45.820 --> 3:37:52.500]  out soup to people for, I think, 17 weeks before the police intervened. And the reason
[3:37:52.500 --> 3:37:58.700]  that they intervened was because they told him he didn't have a license to hand out soup.
[3:37:58.700 --> 3:38:05.300]  That's literally the meme come to fruition. Meanwhile on the social media censorship front,
[3:38:05.300 --> 3:38:09.540]  and let's remember that leftist lobby for social media censorship because they want
[3:38:09.540 --> 3:38:14.580]  to silence their political adversaries, corporations lobby for social media censorship because
[3:38:14.580 --> 3:38:20.140]  they want to eliminate their competition. It has nothing to do with hate speech whatsoever.
[3:38:20.140 --> 3:38:25.580]  That's just a contrived moral panic that they use to get their agenda ran through. Well,
[3:38:25.580 --> 3:38:32.300]  now we have the New York Times citing experts literally calling for a Ministry of Truth to
[3:38:32.300 --> 3:38:38.780]  be controlled by the Biden government to decide what is reality and what is not. New York
[3:38:38.780 --> 3:38:44.980]  Times calls for Biden to appoint realities or to fight misinformation. This is up on
[3:38:44.980 --> 3:38:50.220]  Summit News. The New York Times has amplified claims by experts who are calling for Joe
[3:38:50.220 --> 3:38:54.380]  Biden to appoint a realities are prompting critics to compare the idea to the Ministry
[3:38:54.380 --> 3:39:00.460]  of Truth in George Orwell's 1984. This was an article called how the Biden administration
[3:39:00.460 --> 3:39:06.300]  can help solve our reality crisis. And the New York Times Kevin Ruse, who is constantly
[3:39:06.300 --> 3:39:11.660]  trying to get people banned and de-platformed on social media, cites experts who are calling
[3:39:11.660 --> 3:39:16.500]  on the Biden administration to put together a cross agency task force to tackle disinformation
[3:39:16.500 --> 3:39:21.820]  and domestic extremism, which would be led by something like a quote realities are.
[3:39:21.820 --> 3:39:28.780]  So they're still exploiting this capital breach from what was it now nearly a month ago. Of
[3:39:28.780 --> 3:39:34.860]  course, apparently it was more devastating and deadly than 9 11 Pearl Harbor and Sandy
[3:39:34.860 --> 3:39:41.540]  Hook combined. That's how the media is responding to it still. You have AOC playing the victim
[3:39:41.540 --> 3:39:48.020]  again, going back to that study that I cited in the previous report.
[3:39:48.020 --> 3:39:54.180]  People who claim fake victimhood are dark triad personalities. They're literally psychotic.
[3:39:54.180 --> 3:39:59.020]  And this is a method that people exploit and abuse to get their way and to have their adversaries
[3:39:59.020 --> 3:40:05.620]  crushed in whatever domain that might be. AOC still talking about this capital breach,
[3:40:05.620 --> 3:40:10.780]  like she was going to be killed. She accused Ted Cruz of trying to have her murdered with
[3:40:10.780 --> 3:40:17.020]  no evidence whatsoever. It's complete hysteria all the time. And they're using it as the
[3:40:17.020 --> 3:40:22.180]  drum beat for this increased social media censorship. Like you didn't do enough social
[3:40:22.180 --> 3:40:27.060]  media censorship before the election. You need more. Like you haven't rigged the algorithms
[3:40:27.060 --> 3:40:34.860]  enough. You need even more. It says the job of this realities are would be to head up
[3:40:34.860 --> 3:40:39.220]  a centralized task force that could coordinate a single strategic response to things like
[3:40:39.220 --> 3:40:42.540]  COVID related and election fraud conspiracy theories.
[3:40:42.540 --> 3:40:49.700]  And as Raheem Kasan points out, this is precisely mirrors precisely and it's a cliche that's
[3:40:49.700 --> 3:40:55.140]  used. Oh, this is Orwellian. But this is an actual cliche that works. There's no better
[3:40:55.140 --> 3:41:02.500]  comparison. The Ministry of Truth in Orwell's 1984. Because the Ministry of Truth in the
[3:41:02.500 --> 3:41:08.940]  book decided what the truth was in Oceania, no matter what the actual truth may have
[3:41:08.940 --> 3:41:15.100]  been. They exercise the monopoly over reality by falsifying the nature of historical events.
[3:41:15.100 --> 3:41:22.540]  But that's not all. And having that monopoly of power, the Ministry of Truth in 1984, they
[3:41:22.540 --> 3:41:29.340]  were able to redefine the very word truth under the rubric of new speak so that truth
[3:41:29.340 --> 3:41:35.300]  becomes whatever the government approved version of events is in that moment. And that's precisely
[3:41:35.300 --> 3:41:39.800]  what they're trying to do with this realities are and all these other methods of social
[3:41:39.800 --> 3:41:48.140]  media censorship of rigging algorithms of Brian Stelter on CNN, literally claiming in
[3:41:48.140 --> 3:41:53.940]  opposition to every legal precedent whatsoever, as Glenn Greenwald pointed out, that freedom
[3:41:53.940 --> 3:41:59.620]  of speech is not freedom of reach. Well, now, as Greenwald pointed out, if a protest group
[3:41:59.620 --> 3:42:05.380]  files for permission to protest in a major city, the government, the authorities can't
[3:42:05.380 --> 3:42:09.460]  tell them, oh, you can you can go and protest in this little backstreet on the edge of town
[3:42:09.460 --> 3:42:14.860]  where no one will see you. The legal precedent is completely against that. But he's literally
[3:42:14.860 --> 3:42:21.460]  citing that you don't have the right to freedom of reach to get Newsmax and Fox News and all
[3:42:21.460 --> 3:42:26.420]  these others kicked off cable. Again, it has nothing to do with hate speech and everything
[3:42:26.420 --> 3:42:31.620]  to do with them eliminating their competition. That's what it's been about from the very
[3:42:31.620 --> 3:42:39.420]  start. And again, they use this moral panic of conspiracy theories. I'll make the point
[3:42:39.420 --> 3:42:45.900]  over and over again, the most harmful damaging conspiracy theories that that caused the most
[3:42:45.900 --> 3:42:51.900]  deaths over the past two decades were both peddled by the mainstream media as a result
[3:42:51.900 --> 3:42:56.820]  of them amplifying government propaganda, which was proven to be completely incorrect.
[3:42:56.820 --> 3:43:02.460]  Okay, it was a conspiracy theory amplified by the media that Saddam Hussein had weapons
[3:43:02.460 --> 3:43:07.060]  of mass destruction that led to the invasion of Iraq that led to hundreds of thousands
[3:43:07.060 --> 3:43:13.140]  of dead people. It led to tens of thousands of US troops being maimed, what five, six
[3:43:13.140 --> 3:43:17.700]  thousand of them being killed. That was a conspiracy theory backed up with no real evidence peddled
[3:43:17.700 --> 3:43:23.740]  by the mainstream media. Okay, these are the same people who hyperventilate all day about
[3:43:23.740 --> 3:43:31.660]  how conspiracy theorists are harming society. They are the most harmful entities to society.
[3:43:31.660 --> 3:43:39.380]  They were the ones pushing the freedom fighters in Libya and Iraq, Syria and Libya conspiracy
[3:43:39.380 --> 3:43:45.260]  theory for years on end. The mainstream media said that we were arming the good guys in
[3:43:45.260 --> 3:43:51.260]  Libya, the good guys in Syria. What happened? ISIS took control of Libya. They took control
[3:43:51.260 --> 3:43:58.940]  of large areas of Syria. Gaddafi, the secular leader was kicked out of office, was killed.
[3:43:58.940 --> 3:44:03.980]  ISIS took over the area. That precipitated caused the international migrant crisis. And
[3:44:03.980 --> 3:44:09.460]  again, it was all based on the conspiracy theory that we were supporting freedom fighters
[3:44:09.460 --> 3:44:14.780]  in Libya and Syria. They weren't freedom fighters. They were Islamic jihadists. The
[3:44:14.780 --> 3:44:21.100]  media pushed that. The New York Times pushed that. CNN pushed that. That was harmful. That
[3:44:21.100 --> 3:44:27.420]  was one of the most harmful and damaging conspiracy theories to have been foisted on society over
[3:44:27.420 --> 3:44:33.420]  the past decade, and it continues to reverberate. So when they fear monger about conspiracy
[3:44:33.420 --> 3:44:38.700]  theories again, they always deny ignore their own role in pushing the most harmful conspiracy
[3:44:38.700 --> 3:44:45.180]  theories to society. And as I point out in this article, such lies are also far more
[3:44:45.180 --> 3:44:50.300]  far more harmful to society because mainstream media networks have the biggest platforms.
[3:44:50.300 --> 3:44:55.080]  They are amplified by rigged social media platforms and they share a common consensus
[3:44:55.080 --> 3:45:02.060]  narrative with each other. So the New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, ABC, BBC News, they will
[3:45:02.060 --> 3:45:07.460]  all push the same narrative, which makes it even more harmful because it's amplified
[3:45:07.460 --> 3:45:13.860]  even more. So if you want a reality czar for the media, the reality czar should be over
[3:45:13.860 --> 3:45:19.140]  the corporate press because their conspiracies have proven time and time again to be the most
