[00:00.000 --> 00:24.480]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex
[00:24.480 --> 00:43.280]  Jones. It's the one, the only, what the enemy's trying to keep it from hearing or seeing. Thank
[00:43.280 --> 00:50.760]  you so much for joining us on this live Sunday, February 10, 2019, global transmission. Now,
[00:50.760 --> 01:00.800]  the headline at m4wars.com this afternoon, this evening, says Live Sunday Exclusive,
[01:00.800 --> 01:17.880]  Muller to End Fake Russiagate Probe by March 1st. But criminal indictments and investigations to
[01:17.880 --> 01:24.600]  re-announced within a week after in the Southern District of New York and the District of Columbia
[01:24.600 --> 01:31.880]  and in Chicago. Now, that's a global exclusive because no one's been paying attention to the fine
[01:31.880 --> 01:38.160]  details like yours truly and our team and our researchers. That's all hiding in plain view.
[01:38.160 --> 01:42.280]  And just like I told you, Trump would declare a national emergency to stop the border crisis
[01:42.280 --> 01:47.800]  months later. I mean, I said that back in October of last year, months later, he was going to do it,
[01:47.800 --> 01:55.040]  but didn't do it. And then he let them hurt the economy instead of just stepping in and using
[01:55.040 --> 01:59.360]  executive power to checkmate them. And I'm not saying it's a mistake. Maybe he's smarter than I am.
[01:59.360 --> 02:06.080]  Time will tell. But notice you heard about the national emergency here first. I wasn't wrong
[02:06.080 --> 02:13.240]  when it didn't happen. They were intending to do it. That was the right move. With this Muller
[02:13.240 --> 02:18.760]  thing, folks know I'm right about 98% of the time. The smaller thing, because I'm talking about it,
[02:18.760 --> 02:23.000]  they might change it. Probably not, though. I think they've diminished us and you know,
[02:23.000 --> 02:28.600]  have cut our reach down. Actually, they've made it more influential in elite circles. They've cut
[02:28.600 --> 02:34.040]  the reach some down to the general public. But that's kind of a feedback loop, though. I'm not
[02:34.040 --> 02:41.800]  sure it actually may be helping us, but time will tell. The point is, I'm going to lay out the global
[02:41.800 --> 02:46.360]  exclusives. When we have all the pieces, you know, as you're obsessed with showing you the pieces,
[02:46.360 --> 02:51.240]  and most of you have more pieces than I do. That's why the broadcast is popular,
[02:51.240 --> 02:56.600]  is I'm stating things that newshounds and historians and lay researchers already know,
[02:56.600 --> 03:01.400]  but the news will never echo because they don't want you to think that you're normal or in the
[03:01.400 --> 03:05.960]  majority. That's perception management. That's the fraud we're dealing with.
[03:05.960 --> 03:16.760]  So tonight, I'm going to get into their plan to remove Trump and exactly how they're going
[03:16.760 --> 03:24.600]  to do it. And if he ever thought that they were telling him the truth about Russiagate,
[03:25.160 --> 03:32.200]  he's about to really, really get a rude awakening. They have used Russiagate as the
[03:32.200 --> 03:37.800]  dragnet to harass anyone and everyone connected to him, including hundreds of lawyers he has in
[03:37.800 --> 03:43.400]  hundreds of jurisdictions for real estate. And they catch a few dozen lawyers out of a few hundred,
[03:43.400 --> 03:51.080]  not paying taxes or things like that. They start indicting them as they've done in DC,
[03:52.280 --> 04:00.280]  in New York, in Chicago. Well, then a lot of them will roll over and make something up about Trump.
[04:00.280 --> 04:06.360]  So it was never about Russia. They knew there was nothing there. They were always going to
[04:07.240 --> 04:12.200]  discredit the election with that in people's minds, call all their domestic enemies, Russian agents,
[04:12.200 --> 04:17.160]  like they've done me, the de-platforming. They order ISPs to shut us down. They say,
[04:17.160 --> 04:22.120]  he's a Russian, House Intelligence Committee, no proof, no face mic users. It's asinine.
[04:23.960 --> 04:28.760]  What does Camilla Harris come out and said? We got to remove Trump from office. We got to shut
[04:28.760 --> 04:35.560]  down his prominent supporters. She said, just Friday, she said, it's a national security issue
[04:37.000 --> 04:42.920]  giving to these criminals. So we're going to break it down. This is, this is their plan.
[04:43.720 --> 04:50.760]  It's a 99% chance it's going to go just like this. And the president has to get out ahead of it.
[04:51.560 --> 04:56.200]  He keeps thinking he had nothing wrong. He'll be okay. They're coming for him. They're coming
[04:56.200 --> 05:05.800]  for America. Stay with us. Wars are like 12 round heavyweight boxing championship fights.
[05:06.920 --> 05:11.880]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest and who's ready to do the damage.
[05:12.840 --> 05:15.960]  We took on Hillary Clinton. We stopped her. We got a national stand.
[05:17.160 --> 05:20.360]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now. We are winning.
[05:20.360 --> 05:26.040]  But those of us who are at the very front line at the tip of the spear are under unprecedented
[05:26.040 --> 05:31.720]  attack. So I come to you each day and try to explain to you that this is a war of attrition.
[05:31.720 --> 05:36.680]  This is about who wants it most. And you know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors,
[05:36.680 --> 05:41.080]  they've taken everything. I am in your hands. You are in my hands. I need financial support.
[05:41.080 --> 05:45.720]  And I got products you and your family need. It's that simple. Thousands of great products,
[05:45.720 --> 05:49.640]  whatever is award winning, whatever is best selling, what folks love, what I love,

[05:54.440 --> 05:57.800]  look at all the great products because we're in your hands. I'm in your hands.
[05:58.440 --> 06:05.560]  And your support is beyond critical. Thank you.
[06:05.560 --> 06:31.720]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[06:36.360 --> 06:53.240]  It's Sunday, February 10th, 2019.
[06:54.760 --> 06:57.800]  And yes, this is one of the most important broadcasts we've ever engaged in.
[06:58.760 --> 07:02.440]  I've said that many times because it just, it's more and more serious.
[07:02.440 --> 07:07.640]  20 years ago, I might say once a year, this is the most important broadcast I've ever done.
[07:08.840 --> 07:14.840]  Then 10 years ago, I started saying it every few months. Now the last year or so,
[07:14.840 --> 07:21.320]  I say it every few weeks, because things just get more serious, more insane, more crazy, more
[07:22.280 --> 07:29.000]  down to the wire. All of it, world government, the plan to end the family, human animal clones,
[07:29.000 --> 07:34.440]  cell phones, tracking and live time, watching and listening, five-year-olds being taught to change
[07:34.440 --> 07:43.800]  sex, forced inoculations, open borders, flesh-eating bacteria, autonomous hunter-killer robots,
[07:43.800 --> 07:50.200]  openly launched by the Chinese government. All of it, all of it, total censorship,
[07:51.560 --> 07:56.360]  Apple now telling all new app applications that you can't mention, world government,
[07:56.360 --> 08:04.040]  Satanism, abortion, conservatism, mainline Christian groups banned on Facebook.
[08:05.320 --> 08:10.120]  It's here. Ever wanted to know what total tyranny looked like? You're about to get
[08:11.480 --> 08:18.520]  front-row seats to it, ladies and gentlemen. And in full wars is only a canary in the coal mine.
[08:19.800 --> 08:22.520]  Now here's what's going to happen at the bottom of the hour.
[08:22.520 --> 08:28.840]  At the bottom of the hour, I'm going to reveal the plan to remove the president from office.
[08:29.560 --> 08:34.360]  They've wanted us off air because we actually study U.S. law, U.S. codes,
[08:34.360 --> 08:39.080]  covert action, how globalists have operated in the past, and we've laid out exactly what their
[08:39.080 --> 08:47.160]  plan has been for two years against Trump and against America. Now we've confirmed their attack
[08:47.160 --> 08:53.400]  profile. So we're going to give you their exact plan and how it's going to be rolled out,
[08:53.960 --> 09:00.360]  even beyond the indictments of people very close to the president and indictments of the president
[09:00.360 --> 09:10.200]  himself. It's coming. Now they're telling the president, just work with the system, appoint
[09:10.200 --> 09:18.920]  George Herbert Walker Bush's former attorney general, just appoint all of Mueller's former adjuncts,
[09:20.440 --> 09:26.120]  and we'll leave you alone. That is the total setup and the total betrayal. They do not want
[09:26.120 --> 09:33.080]  Trump to be a kept president, and he's so stubborn he wouldn't do that anyways. They plan on removing
[09:33.080 --> 09:39.480]  him and destroying him and ushering in authoritarianism, the likes of which this
[09:39.480 --> 09:43.640]  planet's never seen. So that's the bottom of the hour. We're going to break that down.
[09:43.640 --> 09:53.080]  Knowing this information could stop it. We'll see if folks are going to be able to get the word out
[09:53.640 --> 10:01.400]  on all of this. Now let me get into all the rest of the news that we're going to be covering today,
[10:01.400 --> 10:07.880]  and then I'll plunge next segment into our first story, our first big report. Obviously that's going
[10:07.880 --> 10:24.600]  to be Alexandria Cortez AOC. The habitation of evil spirits is her nickname. The abode of demons is
[10:24.600 --> 10:31.880]  her birth name. We're going to be discussing her and her latest fraud, where it was on the site
[10:31.880 --> 10:43.480]  for 12 hours on her congressional site that they're going to ban air flight and ban fossil fuels and
[10:43.480 --> 10:52.120]  quote, let people not work if they don't feel like it, and much more. Now, this was on NPR.
[10:53.560 --> 10:58.600]  It's an archive.org. It's on Bing's archive. It's on Google archive. We're going to put it
[10:58.600 --> 11:05.640]  all on screen for you and show you the URL. It didn't matter. She had a flotilla of minions
[11:05.640 --> 11:11.240]  go out onto all of the different channels and say it's fake news conspiracy theory.
[11:12.520 --> 11:20.680]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen. It's fake news conspiracy theory, and all the big fact check
[11:20.680 --> 11:27.400]  sites for saying it is. This is the organized criminal evil of the censors and their lives.
[11:27.400 --> 11:33.320]  So, that's coming up in the next segment with some amazing clips and more. Let's
[11:33.320 --> 11:37.960]  cue up this professor who's involved in it all, who I thought I was tuning into like a comedy
[11:38.840 --> 11:46.200]  piece. Friday night, I was still up here working in the break room and going over some research,
[11:47.000 --> 11:51.160]  and some groups were going to be filing lawsuits on, very important lawsuits,
[11:52.200 --> 11:55.480]  to defend free speech and to stop their racketeering. It's not going to be going the old
[11:55.480 --> 12:00.120]  free speech route like everybody else does. We have the goods on the collusion and
[12:00.120 --> 12:05.560]  porches interference and monopoly activities. I'm sorry. We'll get to that later too once those
[12:05.560 --> 12:12.040]  suits are filed, because we're going to strike back in a big way. But continuing, it's just
[12:12.040 --> 12:18.440]  amazing to watch the professor go on to Carlson and just say, nope, it's made up fake news,
[12:18.440 --> 12:23.320]  and then he does this little fake intellectual Dr. Evil deal, and he has the most ridiculous
[12:23.320 --> 12:28.280]  to pay I've ever seen, because the left thinks it makes him look ironic and smart, kind of that
[12:28.280 --> 12:34.680]  Einstein trick to look like he's had a mushroom cloud on top of his head. So, we're going to be
[12:34.680 --> 12:39.720]  looking at all that as well. If I forgot to tell you guys, get that Tucker Carlson clip,
[12:39.720 --> 12:45.400]  it's at m4wars.com. Articles, right? It's just the first minute or so. The guy is
[12:45.960 --> 12:52.680]  unbelievably hilarious. If it wasn't so dangerous, you know, this is unintentional comedy by these
[12:52.680 --> 12:57.640]  mental patients, and he just sits there and says, nope, it was never put out. It's fake news.
[12:58.840 --> 13:04.680]  And Carlson is laughing because it was up 12 hours. Pelosi responded and said it was BS.
[13:05.320 --> 13:09.640]  That was stupid. And their answer was to remove it and say it was never there.
[13:09.640 --> 13:15.640]  Part of their hateful disdain for truth. And then we're going to get into
[13:15.640 --> 13:25.080]  how Google won't work with the Pentagon on AI. Autonomous weapons, which would be a good idea,
[13:25.080 --> 13:30.840]  maybe if they didn't do it for anybody, but they did it for China. And they're launching
[13:31.800 --> 13:37.320]  slaughter bots. That's their slaughter bots. I'm not kidding. Can kill without human command.
[13:37.880 --> 13:44.280]  That's up on m4wars.com from Newsmax.com. The sun has it. China unleashes killer bots and drones
[13:44.280 --> 13:50.360]  that carry out airstrikes on their own. How loving. So we'll get to all that coming up,
[13:50.360 --> 13:56.120]  and then how Google helps Chinese military. Why not US? Now, the Defense Department asks,
[13:56.120 --> 14:01.240]  because our Congress are a bunch of traders or they're mentally ill, or they've got low IQs.
[14:01.240 --> 14:06.440]  I mean, I sit there and watch the Google and other executives just lie, go, oh, we've never
[14:06.440 --> 14:15.080]  censored anything in our entire history. Meanwhile, Google reaches deals with Russia,
[14:15.080 --> 14:22.200]  China, and Saudi Arabia to censor everyone. And Google reaches deals and Apple reaches deals
[14:22.200 --> 14:27.240]  to help target and round people up and to track women in live time when they try to drive a car
[14:27.240 --> 14:33.000]  and call the government. I mean, this is AP. But they told Congress we've never helped the
[14:33.000 --> 14:36.840]  foreign government censor. We've never had a plan here in the US. We've never targeted
[14:36.840 --> 14:41.640]  conservatives. We've never. Meanwhile, we have all their internal videos, all their own documents,
[14:41.640 --> 14:45.960]  you know, specifically. It's like, who do we mentally target? This is in round table groups
[14:45.960 --> 14:51.000]  and executives. Well, Alex Jones is the number one problem. And then any other dumbass veterans
[14:51.000 --> 14:59.480]  or anybody with American flags, that's Twitter and Google and internal. Alex Jones and veterans
[14:59.480 --> 15:06.840]  and American flags. Oh, and those rednecks and white people. These are quotes. But everything's
[15:06.840 --> 15:12.040]  okay. Everything's all right. Imagine the total disdain these people have from our open and free
[15:12.040 --> 15:17.560]  society and how they've used it against us and our idiot elite. We're busy trying to sell us off
[15:17.560 --> 15:23.880]  the highest bidder and then mount American exceptionalism and independence on the wall.
[15:23.880 --> 15:29.240]  Because these these these fortarians were born and raised and trained to hate American. And now
[15:29.240 --> 15:33.000]  they're in charge selling us out. Even though the Chinese and others are the real enemy,
[15:33.000 --> 15:38.200]  they don't care because they imprinted like baby ducks at birth, hatching out of the rags with
[15:38.200 --> 15:43.560]  little egg tooth. Hate America, hate America, hate America, hate America, hate gun owners,
[15:43.560 --> 15:48.520]  hate men being men, hate exceptionalism, hate Christianity. And that's who they are. And we
[15:48.520 --> 15:54.840]  are in big trouble if we don't awaken to it. It's all coming up so much. It's unbelievable.
[15:54.840 --> 16:21.160]  Please spread the word on every station you're listening to or the internet.

[17:06.760 --> 17:10.440]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper. It consists
[17:10.440 --> 17:14.600]  of the things that we're willing to fight for. The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of
[17:14.600 --> 17:20.360]  the Bill of Rights are prohibitions. They're prohibitions against powerful organizations
[17:20.360 --> 17:25.320]  and individuals taking those God given rights from us as individuals. You better understand
[17:25.320 --> 17:32.680]  that because they're taking them right now. We have seen what they want to do. They called it
[17:32.680 --> 17:38.920]  UN Agenda 21. Now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda. They want everybody off of the rural lands. They
[17:38.920 --> 17:44.280]  want people out of the suburbs. They want to pack everybody into the cities because that's where
[17:44.280 --> 17:50.840]  it is easiest for them to control everyone. It's The David Knight Show. Never missed your show
[17:51.400 --> 18:02.200]  any day. At info wars.com forward slash show. Info wars life is bringing you a breakthrough
[18:02.200 --> 18:08.440]  in modern medicine. Introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new natural way to
[18:08.440 --> 18:14.200]  alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways
[18:14.200 --> 18:21.240]  eye comfort and respiratory function. In the 1960s researchers in France noticed that people who
[18:21.240 --> 18:27.160]  ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began
[18:27.160 --> 18:32.520]  studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research
[18:32.520 --> 18:38.520]  a fast acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is
[18:38.520 --> 18:44.520]  natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact current research has found that it actually
[18:44.520 --> 18:50.200]  acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory
[18:50.200 --> 18:56.520]  responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com
[18:56.520 --> 19:01.800]  and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets. We're bringing back one of the biggest

[20:43.480 --> 20:48.200]  left hand column says Trump leans towards declaring state of emergency.
[20:48.200 --> 20:56.600]  And then it goes into the big CBN report. Now remember, we were the first to tell you in October
[20:56.600 --> 21:00.280]  that that was the best option for the president instead of letting there be a government shutdown
[21:01.640 --> 21:05.480]  that would simply hurt the economy and let the Democrats get what they wanted. Well,
[21:05.480 --> 21:09.800]  he's now come out and tweets and said they want to hurt the economy. They don't want us to do well.
[21:09.800 --> 21:14.840]  That's why I don't let them have shutdowns. That's why I tried, you know, to not have a shutdown.
[21:14.840 --> 21:21.640]  But he went on to say that basically, as he did a few weeks ago, he made declare an emergency.
[21:22.600 --> 21:29.240]  Well, now that's what he's leaning towards because it's in his prerogative. It's under
[21:29.240 --> 21:35.160]  the executive branch clearly, and it won't cost a fraction as much money as two to $3
[21:35.160 --> 21:40.520]  million a week that we lose with a shutdown. So it's very, very important for the president
[21:40.520 --> 21:44.840]  to exercise that power. He's clearly shown that the Democrats are obstructionist. They want to
[21:44.840 --> 21:51.720]  hurt the economy. He's tweeted that out. He's pointed that out. A few months ago, a few weeks
[21:51.720 --> 21:56.360]  ago, and again, just a few days ago, the president was on solid legal ground to declare a national
[21:56.360 --> 22:02.120]  emergency. There have been 58 national emergencies declared since the law was enacted in 76 and 31
[22:02.120 --> 22:07.800]  right now that are currently active. So this is hardly unprecedented. And that's the president today.
[22:07.800 --> 22:17.720]  So again, that's tomorrow's news today. He also tweeted out today that they want a shutdown,
[22:17.720 --> 22:22.280]  that the Democrats, again, want to do that to hurt the economy. So when I tell you this stuff's
[22:22.280 --> 22:28.760]  going on, I'm almost always right from research, but also sources. But most of the time, it's not
[22:28.760 --> 22:35.080]  sources because I research this stuff 20 hours a day sometimes, usually 10, 15 hours a day. I'm
[22:35.080 --> 22:41.000]  obsessed. This is basically all I do. And so a lot of points go into this. And I'm going to cover it
[22:41.000 --> 22:46.040]  in this segment and the next and the next, it'll take probably 30, 40 minutes to cover this properly.
[22:46.040 --> 22:51.080]  GrudgeReport.com is also linked right at the top of the middle column, live info wars, Mueller
[22:51.080 --> 22:59.320]  set to end Russia probe developing. So most of this is open source. Most of this information is
[22:59.320 --> 23:05.000]  all the little thousands of things they've said and done. What Pocahontas came out and said today
[23:05.000 --> 23:12.600]  in a speech, we'll play that clip next segment where she says that he probably won't even be
[23:12.600 --> 23:19.320]  president for the 2020 race. Now, what is she talking about? She's a senator. She's, you know,
[23:19.320 --> 23:24.600]  she's in the top three or four people running. Why, why is she now saying this? Because that's
[23:24.600 --> 23:32.200]  the plan. So let me go ahead and get into this right now. We know that Mueller was about two
[23:32.200 --> 23:38.280]  things, well, really three things covering up all the criminal wiretaps and spying on the Trump
[23:38.280 --> 23:43.960]  campaign, Trump the nominee, Trump, the president elect and Trump the president.
[23:46.280 --> 23:49.240]  So it was meant to be parallel construction where they were illegally spying,
[23:50.200 --> 23:54.520]  but they launched these new investigations to cover up the other criminal investigations that
[23:54.520 --> 23:59.880]  were going on without warrants. We broke that over two years ago. That's now confirmed.
[23:59.880 --> 24:06.760]  That's number one, but not as important. Number two, it's done to discredit the entire
[24:07.640 --> 24:12.040]  election and make it really sound like an outside foreign power was meddling,
[24:12.040 --> 24:16.120]  not illegal aliens and people voting the names of dead people and massive election fraud by
[24:16.120 --> 24:20.120]  Democrats where they got caught. So it's been to delegitimize the election. Everybody's like,
[24:20.120 --> 24:23.480]  yeah, Alex, we know that. Tell us something we don't know. I'm just laying history out here. So
[24:24.520 --> 24:28.680]  cover up them using the national security apparatus, which I first told you in
[24:28.680 --> 24:33.240]  it turned out they were using foreign spy apparatus on the president during the campaign
[24:33.240 --> 24:37.880]  so they could keep it secret from the courts. Then they use that fake info and fake foreign
[24:37.880 --> 24:46.760]  dossiers to get the ongoing investigation launched. Discredit the election. And then
[24:46.760 --> 24:56.280]  now the finale, which is really the number one reason out of three, launch a giant dragnet over
[24:56.280 --> 25:01.960]  the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of top lawyers, thousands of lawyers and managers total
[25:03.240 --> 25:08.680]  that Trump has at hundreds of properties in almost every state of the union.
[25:09.320 --> 25:13.480]  He's got like properties, was like 26 states or something, ridiculous and sub properties
[25:13.480 --> 25:17.400]  or pieces of properties almost every state. In fact, look up how many places in the US
[25:17.400 --> 25:20.840]  he has properties. I know it's insane. He's got properties over 30 countries. I know that.
[25:20.840 --> 25:27.320]  And if you notice the dragnets are all, oh, this lawyer didn't pay taxes on
[25:28.920 --> 25:34.840]  taxi cab medallions or this lawyer himself didn't pay all of his property tax, but he's
[25:34.840 --> 25:41.000]  Trump's lawyer or this lawyer might have laundered some money. These are just lawyers he hires.
[25:41.000 --> 25:48.680]  So they have this huge Russia dragnet, suck everything into it, interview all of his
[25:48.680 --> 25:55.240]  offices, renters and owners and managers and just his family and just harass everybody for years
[25:55.720 --> 26:02.520]  on end to two years, use all their illegal wiretaps and stuff to find dirt on people
[26:02.520 --> 26:07.960]  they're targeting, not connected to Russia gate or even Trump and then get a huge assemblage
[26:08.920 --> 26:14.440]  of people who are about to go to prison unless they turn state's evidence against somebody
[26:14.440 --> 26:26.760]  in the Trump orbit. A Don Jr., a Jared Kushner, a Ivanka Trump. And so the dragnet works that way
[26:27.880 --> 26:32.920]  trying to get them to then flip and turn state's evidence. And so here's the intel we've got
[26:33.480 --> 26:41.960]  and this is a little bit I got from sources. I got one call from let's just say the military
[26:41.960 --> 26:48.920]  attached to the CIA and somebody that doesn't play games and they said, hey, I'll be able to talk to
[26:48.920 --> 26:57.960]  you over the phone again in mid-March. It'll all be over then. Then I got a call from a former high
[26:57.960 --> 27:03.560]  level CIA person involved with the Pentagon saying, you know, your boy Trump's done and you better
[27:03.560 --> 27:07.960]  get straight what you're going to do or you're going to be in a world of hurt. I said, go to hell.
[27:07.960 --> 27:13.000]  And then I got another call and then I got another call and then I got another text message
[27:13.960 --> 27:21.560]  from a very prominent person. It's a household name saying Trump is going to be gone and that's
[27:21.560 --> 27:28.840]  just the way it is. And it's his fault for not standing up for himself and it's going to get
[27:28.840 --> 27:33.080]  really bloody and really bad if he isn't gone. So things will be better after he's gone.
[27:33.080 --> 27:40.360]  So let me break this down for you ladies and gentlemen.
[27:42.920 --> 27:47.880]  They're threatening everybody and they're telling everybody that Trump's going to be
[27:47.880 --> 27:52.200]  gone by mid-March. I told you that in October when I first started getting these calls.
[27:54.280 --> 27:57.720]  And I've talked to some very prominent people and they've been told the exact same thing.
[27:57.720 --> 28:00.200]  And that's how you take a country down. Now listen to me carefully.
[28:00.200 --> 28:07.880]  You know the French didn't fight Hitler in 1940. You know that in Gulf War I and Gulf War II they
[28:07.880 --> 28:13.720]  bought off most of the generals so they stood down when the U.S. attacked. That's how real
[28:13.720 --> 28:18.920]  military operations go as you buy off the opposition and you activate your spies inside of it.
[28:18.920 --> 28:23.160]  So what's happening is they're reaching out to everybody saying you'll be okay as long as you
[28:23.160 --> 28:31.880]  don't try to stop this it's going down. And only people like Sean Hannity and myself and a few others
[28:31.880 --> 28:37.560]  are not taking the threats. So when we come back it's the same deal. They're making their move
[28:37.560 --> 28:42.760]  in the president. Now they may back off and stop. They were already planning it in December of 2017
[28:42.760 --> 28:47.560]  and backed off but this time they intend to move and I'm going to explain it when we come back.
[28:47.560 --> 28:52.520]  Russia Gates ending but within days of an ending they're going to launch all these new criminal
[28:52.520 --> 28:54.680]  indictments and announcements. Stay with us. I'll break it down.
[28:59.880 --> 29:03.480]  It's simple. If you want to beat the globalist, if you want to take on the new world order,
[29:03.480 --> 29:08.440]  I'm not doing Bitcoin pumping dumps with Jack Dorsey. I'm not sitting here selling you cancer

[29:17.480 --> 29:21.720]  it's anti-inflammatory and what's the best lab in the country? Okay they're the highest rate.
[29:21.720 --> 29:26.440]  I'm like you're only 50% curcuminoid? Well yeah they want to put $5 product and bottle but that's
[29:26.440 --> 29:31.960]  still incredible sir. I'm like uh what's the highest you could do a month later? Uh 90-95%
[29:31.960 --> 29:36.280]  no one's ever done it. I said how much did that cost for a bottle? That cost $10 no one's ever done
[29:36.280 --> 29:41.720]  that sir. The average to predators 3 to 5% here. The top brand's 50%. I'm like we're going to have
[29:41.720 --> 29:46.200]  95% curcuminoid. I mean you understand like that's like our information is explosive? Our

[33:38.600 --> 33:45.960]  So I was told in October of last year and I said it here on air that in early March of 2019
[33:47.240 --> 33:53.640]  the Miller probe would end and that a lot of sources I have in things could talk to me again
[33:53.640 --> 33:58.520]  and then because I would not be implicated in Russiagate anymore but that they had used the
[33:58.520 --> 34:04.520]  dragnet against Trump and his family and all of his companies and all of his employees to try to
[34:04.520 --> 34:11.400]  find other criminal activities not of Trump but of anybody not paying taxes all of what we saw with
[34:11.400 --> 34:18.600]  Cohen and I kept getting these calls I kept getting these text messages by very prominent people
[34:18.600 --> 34:26.520]  and then again about a month ago I got one from an extremely prominent person and they've been given
[34:26.520 --> 34:33.960]  the same talking to and their argument is Trump is standing up for himself so he kind of deserves it
[34:33.960 --> 34:39.160]  and at a certain point when somebody won't stand up against a criminal conspiracy because they're
[34:39.160 --> 34:43.560]  innocent they think oh that's ridiculous and then they're going to get taken down I'm not mad at
[34:43.560 --> 34:53.480]  Trump I'm just kind of really upset about what's going on here now Drudge is linked to this
[34:53.480 --> 34:57.880]  article that has the live feed in it I suggest folks share this because I'm going to condense
[34:57.880 --> 35:05.240]  what's happening right now and then go to the evidence live Sunday exclusive
[35:05.240 --> 35:15.400]  Mueller probe to end March 1st or thereabouts New York DC and Chicago to announce criminal
[35:15.400 --> 35:23.800]  indictments of Trump after and again those are the federal US attorneys and prosecutors
[35:24.760 --> 35:30.120]  in those areas that's the plan so Mueller was simply there to cover up the illegal spine that
[35:30.120 --> 35:36.200]  was going on discredit the election and the minds of the people but then the coup de grace the final
[35:36.200 --> 35:44.600]  blow the dessert the main the main mission the main course really the end game is to then
[35:44.600 --> 35:51.320]  launch all these criminal indictments of people all around Trump and then create a firestorm
[35:51.320 --> 35:56.280]  that he is a criminal and doesn't need to be in office and then trigger civil unrest and so much
[35:56.280 --> 36:01.720]  more in and hope to plunge the economy because this will kill here's another prediction if they do
[36:01.720 --> 36:06.120]  this because I'm not saying this is going to happen but it's like a bank robber has the gun to the
[36:06.120 --> 36:11.000]  you know the teller's head they might pull the trigger this is currently their plan and you
[36:11.000 --> 36:18.040]  can see them saying all this too I mean they admit a lot of this but it's the behind the
[36:18.040 --> 36:26.200]  scenes preparation the threats that'll be better for you and your family Alex if you just sit this
[36:26.200 --> 36:28.440]  one out well what is sitting it out me
[36:32.040 --> 36:37.560]  we'll say the president's an idiot and turn against him well that's not true and I'm not doing it
[36:39.160 --> 36:40.680]  you know what's the next thing I'm supposed to do
[36:44.440 --> 36:50.280]  it's just I mean there's got to be some point where people don't back down America was built on
[36:50.280 --> 36:55.880]  not backing down that's what we were exceptional everywhere else everybody back down and he end
[36:55.880 --> 37:02.920]  up in Nazi Germany or communist Venezuela I'm done because the men that back down in this country
[37:02.920 --> 37:10.360]  make me sick but but I'm I'm digressing let's get to the evidence here so they end the Russia probe
[37:11.720 --> 37:16.920]  and they'll have the house continue it with shift in the judiciary committee you so this will never
[37:16.920 --> 37:21.480]  admit that it was you know over but there's nothing there they admit that the Senate intelligence
[37:21.480 --> 37:25.720]  committee and all the rest have said zero nothing yeah no it's all Hillary and Mueller and the rest
[37:25.720 --> 37:31.000]  of them it's ridiculous change the subject onto your enemy of what you've actually done
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.080]  which was another side component they picked something to alleged that Trump and his supporters
[37:35.080 --> 37:38.200]  are done because they were guilty of it and scared you know what about it
[37:41.160 --> 37:47.640]  and so how this works is quite simple they have the regular suspects now introducing articles
[37:47.640 --> 37:56.040]  impeachment tomorrow for the third time multiple Democrat bills will be introduced this week Democrat
[37:56.040 --> 38:02.440]  Al Green what a idiot vows to move forward with third impeachment effort dividing party
[38:02.440 --> 38:06.440]  well he loves to run America down all day but man he sure done well in this country
[38:08.440 --> 38:14.360]  they love our milk and honey if they preach some other way of living you're running down my country
[38:14.360 --> 38:21.320]  costs welcome to fight inside of me about to see a country run by mr green or founded by mr green
[38:22.680 --> 38:28.440]  mr dumbass excuse me i'm digressing and you've got Elizabeth Warren let's get that clip ready
[38:28.440 --> 38:36.360]  this is just today stumping in where Iowa Trump may not even be a free person by 2020
[38:36.360 --> 38:42.520]  and she says every day it's a racist tweet it's another this is the party of the kkk
[38:42.520 --> 38:50.920]  race baiting everywhere this is trump literally doing the proper type of form of action demanding
[38:50.920 --> 38:57.240]  giant factories be built in specifically black areas that they be incentivized to have job training
[38:57.240 --> 39:03.640]  and hire them for dignity but i'm not going to go into trumps history buying up all these golf
[39:03.640 --> 39:08.520]  courses that blacks couldn't attend and having new leadership and then actually incentivizing
[39:08.520 --> 39:12.200]  ambassadors to get black folks to come play because they were so freaked out they wouldn't come
[39:12.200 --> 39:19.320]  play trump handing out free memberships to black people was it was smart he'd hand him out to like

[47:49.640 --> 47:56.200]  indictments of trump after when i say trump you should probably add if i told the writer what to
[47:56.200 --> 48:03.320]  post trump organization i think they miss org trump organization but trump is person one
[48:03.880 --> 48:11.720]  he's target one he's organization one that's all admitted so what do you do simple you're illegally
[48:11.720 --> 48:16.520]  spying on him as a candidate you're using international espionage operations to do it we first
[48:16.520 --> 48:22.280]  reported on that two plus years ago now confirmed that's illegal you use that illegal operation
[48:22.280 --> 48:26.360]  and fake dossiers to start a new criminal investigation in the united states once he's elected
[48:27.560 --> 48:31.880]  then you use that to try to discredit his election connecting it to russians that's not true
[48:31.880 --> 48:41.160]  but you use the dragnet to find people in his circle or in his orbit who you can find for tax
[48:41.160 --> 48:47.720]  problems money laundering gambling sex who knows what it is like mr cohen and you start indicting
[48:47.720 --> 48:52.520]  them and then you tell them if you tell us a bunch of dirt about the president or you say he knew
[48:52.520 --> 48:57.000]  about this crime you were committing or that crime you were committing on property taxes whatever the
[48:57.000 --> 49:08.840]  case may be we're gonna let you go for a reduced sentence and that's the ball of wax and that's
[49:08.840 --> 49:15.000]  what different people who've been involved in this have come out and actually said they've been offered
[49:15.000 --> 49:21.000]  and said they've been told they've been given sheets and been told you are to do this rudolf
[49:21.000 --> 49:26.120]  juliani trump's chief lawyer has said he's seen the agreements because of joint defense agreements
[49:26.120 --> 49:30.440]  they have with some of these individuals like dr corcy they've given corcy these big list of things
[49:30.440 --> 49:35.160]  he's supposed to say i'm not going to get in the middle of you know who's good who's bad between
[49:35.160 --> 49:39.080]  him and roger and their fight i just know this they're trying to make corsie say things that
[49:39.080 --> 49:45.560]  aren't true and so far he's he's he's withstood it and that's a good thing but but but now you've
[49:45.560 --> 49:53.960]  seen roger who's who's been indicted and none of it is russia it's all process it's all he lied to
[49:53.960 --> 50:02.600]  congress with no evidence of that where is the russia crime it's not there so you've got 150
[50:02.600 --> 50:09.720]  prosecutors in the southern district and they have been collecting data on trump since he was a candidate
[50:11.400 --> 50:16.120]  and they're coming after him and all the inside baseball i've heard is they're going to make their
[50:16.120 --> 50:22.440]  move in march muller's going to end it he's going to put his report out but then out of that report
[50:22.440 --> 50:28.440]  remember it was muller admittedly doing the russia gate investigation that quote came across
[50:28.440 --> 50:39.960]  michael co in the rat not paying his 15 million dollars in taxes and it wasn't even all him he
[50:39.960 --> 50:44.440]  had a bunch of partners in the company not paying for the medallions faking medallions well that's
[50:44.440 --> 50:48.760]  an old scam the taxes are so high in new york if you don't cheat on your taxes you're going to go
[50:48.760 --> 50:56.280]  bankrupt i'm not saying that's a good thing the point is is that what is muller doing investigating
[50:56.280 --> 51:03.480]  medallions and unpaid city taxes like what are the feds doing involved in that well their argument
[51:03.480 --> 51:09.960]  is it's money laundering okay so then he quote alerts the southern district type it into a search
[51:09.960 --> 51:17.960]  engine muller alerted southern district to michael co in so that's the mo i'm not just telling you
[51:17.960 --> 51:25.080]  this is my opinion this is what they've done this is what they've set up it's not going to be shift
[51:25.080 --> 51:30.600]  of the judiciary committee covering up russia gate and china gate for hillary and server gate
[51:30.600 --> 51:35.720]  it's not going to be any of that no no no it's all going to be trump associates who are facing
[51:35.720 --> 51:42.680]  long prison sentences because the corrupt muller probe has done a fine-tooth comb of every facet
[51:42.680 --> 51:52.520]  of their life and found some fleas found some cooties found some ticks and that's how america dies
[51:52.520 --> 51:58.840]  is with an out of control federal prosecutorial system who is in the the wiki leaks and who is
[51:58.840 --> 52:03.720]  in the documents and is who in the text saying insurance policy we can't let him get in if he
[52:03.720 --> 52:09.800]  does we got to have something to take him down any investigation that has something like that in it
[52:09.800 --> 52:15.000]  is null and void all the more reason it became the drag debt when there was no russia gate two
[52:15.000 --> 52:23.880]  years ago strock and page and org all of them are saying there's nothing here this guy's incredibly
[52:23.880 --> 52:28.120]  clean there's no foreign entangle but there's nothing we don't know what we're going to do most
[52:28.120 --> 52:34.600]  of hillary's money was from foreign governments including russia and so they say well just keep
[52:34.600 --> 52:41.000]  hammering it while we find some dirt on something move forward and that's the plan so i asked the
[52:41.000 --> 52:45.560]  listeners i asked the world i asked matt drudge who's obviously tuned in right now i asked tucker
[52:45.560 --> 52:50.680]  carlson i asked john hennedy i asked rush limbaugh i asked everybody you know when they get trump
[52:50.680 --> 52:54.040]  they're coming for everybody else they said they are they know america's turned against
[52:54.040 --> 52:58.120]  globalism and leftist garbage they know we're awake they know that they're on tv saying let's
[52:58.120 --> 53:03.560]  abort babies after they're born they know people are fundamentally sick of this and and are vomiting
[53:03.560 --> 53:10.440]  it out are rejecting it they're raping us it's like serial abuse we're literally like beaten
[53:10.440 --> 53:16.280]  lives here literally just get out of my life leave me alone no they say we're coming after your
[53:16.280 --> 53:23.560]  speech we're coming after your bank accounts we're coming after everybody your kids and so what do we
[53:23.560 --> 53:29.880]  do i hope whitaker is a good guy the way they are tactically at the viciously at those hearings
[53:29.880 --> 53:35.720]  we'll play some of that next hour looks like he is but the new guy trump put in is literally
[53:35.720 --> 53:44.200]  robert moeller's daddy burr the guy that brought him in the guy that set up the cia in 89 to take
[53:44.200 --> 53:48.760]  over the fbi because the fbi had its problems before but the left didn't like it because it was
[53:48.760 --> 53:55.000]  anti-communist and had a little soft spot for americana and a lot of their ages were good people
[53:55.000 --> 54:02.680]  but man since then what have you seen the fbi has become a puppet of the worst elements of the cia
[54:02.680 --> 54:11.720]  the worst elements of the cia and some people online go look i knew jones was cia he said he
[54:11.720 --> 54:16.600]  talked to him it's like saying i talked to a new york times reporter the cia is the biggest
[54:18.200 --> 54:24.600]  federal agency out there outside of the post office their people are everywhere i have been
[54:24.600 --> 54:31.320]  messed with by the masade i have been jacked with by mi6 and mi5 i have been jacked with by
[54:31.320 --> 54:37.080]  saudi intelligence i have been people claiming to work for russians like 10 years ago a couple
[54:37.080 --> 54:43.720]  times in new york you know said putin likes you you like blonde woman uh no no uh well you like
[54:43.720 --> 54:49.160]  you like you like the investment in stock market i'm like no get away from me that's my extent of
[54:49.160 --> 54:55.320]  the russians trying to get to me and you're prominent you get spies coming up to you
[54:55.320 --> 55:02.360]  with the russians it was incredibly blatant you're like a woman's you like you
[55:03.320 --> 55:06.840]  with everybody else it was like well we're thinking about whether we're gonna hurt do
[55:06.840 --> 55:11.560]  something bad to you or not we're thinking about we're gonna allow you to you know keep
[55:12.360 --> 55:18.200]  a lot of people die around here jones might want to join the club and be our
[55:18.200 --> 55:25.160]  our bitch plus you're a pretty smart guy but you're pretty well for yourself oh thanks thanks
[55:25.960 --> 55:30.760]  see because there's a few people still act like this is america i'm not gonna put up with your crap
[55:31.640 --> 55:35.400]  you supposedly have all this power to fight big evil groups but you're ally with radical islam
[55:35.400 --> 55:39.880]  you're ally with the chai comms who literally have got all of our technology and now have all
[55:39.880 --> 55:45.320]  these ai weapons and we don't you're called traders you're called candy asses that rolled over to
[55:45.320 --> 55:51.560]  every foreign power and every white shoe boy you could find so i'm done with you but when we start
[55:51.560 --> 55:57.240]  the next hour i'm going to get into what trump needs to do to counter this and i'm going to open
[55:57.240 --> 56:02.200]  the phones up but i will get 30 calls and i won't get to all of you so we're going to take six or
[56:02.200 --> 56:08.040]  seven phone calls that are specifically on topic of what do you think trump needs to do to avert
[56:08.040 --> 56:12.440]  this and stop this because it's clear as day this is coming and it's happening in the next
[56:12.440 --> 56:17.880]  phases here they use the molar probe to illegally launch all these investigations to go and harass
[56:17.880 --> 56:22.200]  everybody to then lie about the president and set this up and now they're making their move
[56:22.200 --> 56:27.560]  so what does the president need to do this is a very important broadcast and they've wanted
[56:27.560 --> 56:33.160]  to soft the air before they do this now let me mention them wanting to soft the air a please
[56:33.160 --> 56:40.680]  spread the word about our videos and articles and separately please for heaven's sakes you need our

[01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:43.560]  so america is in an emergency corrupt law firms special interests lobbyists and mega corporations
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:48.360]  that are multinational have decided to move to china they decided to move to the e u they decided
[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:55.560]  to move to india and mexico and they basically sold off american power because america had the
[01:20:55.560 --> 01:21:00.200]  promise of christianity and of capitalism and free market and the corporations they're not
[01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:03.720]  communists they use communism to control us at the grassroots to make us dependent
[01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:10.520]  domesticated they're globalist they're like jeff bezos who pays no tax in cities pays no federal
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:15.800]  tax all his money goes offshore he makes cities compete with each other where nothing's paid his
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:23.080]  employees get screwed it's like instacart that even pay its employees it gets the tips to then give
[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:30.440]  that to themselves and then give the employee almost nothing you look at silicon valley nothing's
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:36.360]  more soulless nothing's more hateful nothing's more automated nothing's more anti-human nothing's
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:45.400]  more sicky sweet liberal on the surface because that's the sjw cover is to tell you how good they are
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:52.600]  to tell you how much they love you but to hate humanity so what should trump do to strike back
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:56.120]  against this i've got some ideas i'll talk about the start of the next segment but i want to get
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:22:08.440]  your ideas daniel teddy michael stan paul carlos and others let's talk to carlos first from montreal
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:13.160]  canada he's a he's a caller gets in every few months always has great points carlos you agree
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:16.520]  about the crisis we're in the move they're about to make men hell they're admitting it
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:22.840]  90% of it and what do you think we the president should do thank you yes i share your views alex
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:29.320]  um i you couldn't you concentrate on the vast evidence and knowledge of history that's very
[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:34.200]  important and then you focus and narrow down and you see patterns are repeat and then you focus
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:39.720]  and narrow down to the level that you now make can make certain predictions from semantic analysis
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:46.040]  of the things that are said and why they're said i i'm longing the tooth uh in this in this attitude
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:51.320]  and i recognizing you and there's a most powerful assistance to the president that that he can count
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:56.680]  on is to have people like you who really know the background and can make predictions now having
[01:22:56.680 --> 01:23:01.240]  said that i'll tell you something about president trump also strong his weapon and that is that
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:09.640]  evil does not respect or manipulate but fears facts and the facts for president trump are clear
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:14.920]  this is a self-financed businessman a billionaire who's had to make tough decisions all his life
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:21.240]  and to decide to run for high office with dirty background dirty laundry or things in the closet
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:26.440]  are certainly not the right things that have it's not a why yeah no he would never he would never
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:30.840]  do that you know he went by the book with top law firms on everything that's why they're targeting
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:38.840]  the law firms to get them to lie right the the next thing is that he was um uh in i guess naive
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:43.400]  as a person who's never been in politics a long long period and been in congress and senate and so
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:49.400]  on and and or a governor of states or whatever that he the the political world wasn't his expertise
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:54.840]  so when he became president that was his greatest weakness because as reince brevis was told when
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:59.720]  he was in charge of the republican party was get rid of that candidate whatever you have to do get
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:04.760]  rid of him that was in the newspapers that was said so no exactly the very fact that he'd never
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:09.240]  been in office he could turn things around because he had a fresh approach but it's also
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:12.520]  his greatest weakness because he doesn't other tricks great point carlos we're going to move
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:17.320]  quickly here uh we're going to go to reggie in california trump needs to audit the fed
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:21.640]  i agree go after the privately foreign owned fed that will get their attention that's a great
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:26.280]  place to counter strike instead of fighting the minions with fake indictments of his family
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:33.080]  and others go directly at their power go directly to private federal reserve go ahead reggie absolutely
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:40.920]  we got to audit the fed and the fed we do need some other system of currency you know all these
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:47.720]  things but also march first is the debt ceiling hits the limit again and i mean what nobody's
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:52.760]  even talking about that march first is a couple weeks away we're going to hit the debt ceiling
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:57.720]  again every six months we're hitting the debt ceiling and these politicians they're almost
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:04.440]  seems like both of them are aware that they are having to spy off us into not even focusing on it
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:09.800]  that's right well the word is that i heard like i said in october i said march is when
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:13.400]  they're gonna in the russia probe going to all the new criminal probes and notice
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:17.960]  they said a month ago they said oh it'll end by february so it's been announced that senators
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:22.840]  are saying they've been told in early march muller ends it so i'm i'm announcing things that they've
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:27.560]  already announced they may change it the intent of this show is to get so much information out
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:32.600]  there that uh there's so much light on this that it doesn't happen i appreciate your call reggie great
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:38.520]  point let's go to a caller in oregon let's talk to daniel daniel you're on the air thanks for calling
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:46.680]  the night oh great for having me alex um i was thinking that trump you know he really is a master
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:54.520]  strategist a lot of people don't give him credit uh but his sister who's a federal judge she stopped
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:59.400]  playing board games with them and card games with them when they were young because she said that he
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:07.240]  would always win um and he seemed like he didn't even know how to play but he was you know just
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:14.520]  always uh playing possum or something like that um i also know someone in business who had visits
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:22.760]  going with don trump and he said that don trump had 13 contingency plans for every business move
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:30.040]  that he made so a lot of that thing too a lot of okay well that pisses me off then if trump is this
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:36.200]  master 50 level chess you know yoda on pcp then he's not defending the first amendment and all the
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:41.080]  censorship of conservatives and nationalists and patriots and veterans groups that have been run
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:46.280]  over and destroyed and attacked and not even allowed to be in commerce literally unpersoned
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:52.520]  this is like nazi-level stuff because hitler didn't start killing people who weren't his own nazis
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:57.000]  in power struggles until about 37 he took their bank accounts away he took their businesses away
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:02.600]  he demonized them so if trumps got all this master stuff going on uh then then we need to see it i mean
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:07.640]  what's he doing like the first amendment hang out here you know to to flail around the wind
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:14.040]  i agree alex and i think you know you may very well be right like he could just be going out there
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:21.800]  like a boxing opponent and allowing the the his opponent to uh you know hit him in the jaw as
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:30.360]  hard as he can but you never know if if you know i i think that if it don't here's the deal here's
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:35.160]  the deal okay if you want to say some idiot savant master guy he did get elected never running for
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:39.080]  office of the presidency nobody's done that but towards washington here's the problem
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:47.480]  letting them do all this and persecute people is wrong so saying he's letting us be sacrificial
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:53.000]  lambs to piss people off he's got all the proof he's got all the evidence and i know folks that
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:58.760]  are close to president they say that's not the case he's watching fox news all day so he's making
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:05.960]  these big multi-chest moves then off of that i agree he's still smart at 72 but he's not covering his
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:10.520]  but i appreciate your call you say there's a lot of cards to play you didn't tell me the cards to
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:15.080]  play but we're out of time come back with a few more calls and i've got some more uh clips i want to
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:25.880]  play teddy in chicago dan in origan michael and alberta canada michael's up next and stan and paul
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:32.920]  that's it for calls i mean we got jefferson says he classify okc and dissolve congress well you know
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:37.240]  there's executive orders the president can declare an emergency for six months to dissolve congress
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:43.320]  no one's ever done it but i mean i don't know hell he won't even declare an emergency on the
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:49.240]  border when that's constitutional so i mean i wouldn't be looking for that to happen i i just know
[01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:54.200]  this these globalists are trying to plunge the economy right now to teach america not to vote

[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:35.640]  question i'm assume you know the difference the investigation in the possible trump russia
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:44.200]  collusion in the 2016 election has resulted in 37 indictments is that correct i believe that number
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:50.520]  is correct but most of those folks were russian citizens 34 individuals have been indicted so
[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:56.600]  let's stop right there and it just goes on and on just the just the nastiness the lowliness the

[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:24.520]  was wearing a big old giant fake black toupee on his head we'd all make fun of him like the guy that
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:29.000]  was on tucker carlson i'll show him in a minute it's just like what's up with leftist and weird

[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:21.160]  behind i've got so many other clips on the plate but the nastiness is like tell us exactly who you

[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:06.360]  ways they've they've got him hemmed up and uh what they're going to do is the same thing they did
[01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:11.960]  with ross perot if you remember um you know as he was a candidate and as he became popular
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:16.680]  he became popular and threatened to kill his threatened to kill his daughter absolutely and i think
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:20.920]  that's what's coming i think you're going to see a complete change of 180 the things that you're
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:25.320]  talking about with trump the things that he's been able to do and not been able to do um i think
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:29.960]  are subject to that he's in a lot of trouble and we got to protect him i love our president real

[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:13.160]  save by a killing seizure what we need to do his trump's asset is the american patriot the american
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:19.160]  people we need to stand up in the meantime formulate his strike forces and let them come
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:25.320]  through their aggression total gondi logic they'll be the aggressors in history and then we'll have
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:30.760]  to defend our republic i believe that well trump is fatalistic do you think trump's setting himself
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:35.000]  up in a christlike way to be destroyed and he believes out of that comes a victory is that what
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:40.440]  you're saying i do believe that but he still needs to declare the emergency that's a side
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:45.560]  issue he still needs to stand up and keep being president but in terms of them trying to set him
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:51.560]  up and bring him down let them try and then they're not trying they're they're doing it but i hear

[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:56.040]  their flatulence is bad she says uh get rid of airplanes they're evil uh and people that don't
[01:48:56.040 --> 01:49:01.240]  want to work people that can't work or don't want to work is the quote give them free stuff and so
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:08.120]  instead of defending it once everybody said this is incredibly bad she said it doesn't exist and put
[01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:16.360]  some weird professor with this giant to pay on tucker carlson other shows to say that we were
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:22.600]  liars and that we'd created fake news so they'll lie even when they're caught
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:30.840]  why they don't care watch courtes gas lights green new deal
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:41.480]  that's cornell university professor green activist and courtes advisor robert hawkett
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:47.720]  and the guy literally show him on screenplays he looks like bozo the clown he's trying to
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:53.480]  look all ironic full screen you can't get the full horror he's got weird like green teeth and he's
[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:59.720]  goes uh liar never exists third we never thought about even has a fake atlantic you know like fake
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:05.080]  British section hell dare you listen buffy first and howl the third
[01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:15.080]  so this is the reality we're dealing with here is that they come out and they won't stand up when
[01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:20.040]  trump says let's not kill babies after they're born courtes
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:31.880]  the speaker of the house Pelosi none of them will even stand up so the mysterious case of aoc's
[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:38.680]  scrubbed green new deal details and then it goes on from there meanwhile we have all the screenshots
[01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:44.600]  all the articles her tweeting it in the morning on her own twitter she doubles down on free money
[01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:49.880]  for lazy people and admits that well that's actually in her plan and the quote is people
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:56.040]  unable to work or those who don't want to work so trumps come out and said this is a great idea
[01:50:56.040 --> 01:51:01.720]  you should embrace this we're only we turn off all the carbon and no one else does and we literally
[01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:05.720]  most studies show that about eight percent of the population would die within two years without
[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:12.200]  carbon in the u.s. but that's okay because we have a fop with a big giant you know giant
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:17.560]  i mean i was on tv with like huge to pay like a foot like an eight inches tall and i was like
[01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:21.560]  hi i'm bob's big boy do what i say no we didn't do that
[01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:30.280]  but here's the actual green new deal facts from the archive of bing search engine
[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:37.960]  and it says right here all the stuff that they're going to do but she says they never said it
[01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:47.320]  even though we have them all saying so this is who these people are this is this is how they operate
[01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:54.360]  this is the world they want to build this is what they want to do now i haven't gotten to this yet
