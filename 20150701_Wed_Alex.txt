[00:00.000 --> 00:12.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.480 --> 00:21.240]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:21.240 --> 00:28.260]  welcome to the alex jones show I'm david night your host on this Wednesday
[00:28.260 --> 00:33.400]  July 1st 2015 alex jones is going to be joining us in the next segment he's
[00:33.400 --> 00:37.560]  going to be talking about some very important issues things are really
[00:37.560 --> 00:43.020]  coming to a head in so many different ways we've got Obama removing the TPP's
[00:43.020 --> 00:48.760]  anti-slavery clauses while at the same time he pats himself on the back for
[00:48.760 --> 00:54.520]  taking a principle stand by removing a confederate flag total symbolism over
[00:54.520 --> 00:58.720]  substance but even worse than that Alice is going to be talking about Obama's
[00:58.720 --> 01:03.840]  secret directives these are not executive orders these are secret orders
[01:03.840 --> 01:07.520]  that are like executive orders except they're not published you know we have
[01:07.520 --> 01:13.880]  secret laws we have secret courts we have secret dictates from our not so
[01:13.880 --> 01:17.140]  secret dictator anymore we all know what this is about he's also going to be
[01:17.140 --> 01:21.760]  talking about the recent court decision in Oklahoma the Supreme Court there
[01:21.760 --> 01:26.400]  just removed a 10 commandments monument saying that it was establishing a
[01:26.400 --> 01:32.000]  religion know what it was doing was establishing the foundation of our laws
[01:32.000 --> 01:36.880]  of our cultures but it's necessary for us to remove those foundations that's
[01:36.880 --> 01:41.200]  what this is really about look they have the Magna Carta on the door of the
[01:41.200 --> 01:45.840]  Supreme Court they have eight panels showing our various things that they
[01:45.840 --> 01:49.600]  think were very important in terms of developing the rule of law Magna Carta
[01:49.600 --> 01:55.440]  was one of those we understand where our foundations for our culture come from
[01:55.440 --> 01:57.920]  if we look at the declaration of independence it's very important that
[01:57.920 --> 02:02.360]  we understand that our rights don't come from men they come from God you
[02:02.360 --> 02:06.880]  should support that even if you're an atheist support the idea that because
[02:06.880 --> 02:11.600]  you know what if you don't acknowledge God as a source of your rights you are
[02:11.600 --> 02:16.160]  going to have men who act as if they're God we're also going to talk about of
[02:16.160 --> 02:20.840]  course the nine ring race they've been very busy this week the Supreme Court
[02:20.840 --> 02:27.160]  the Nazgul has been busy handing out their edicts just like our executive
[02:27.160 --> 02:31.040]  who tyrant who is putting out his orders they have their orders as well
[02:31.040 --> 02:35.400]  we're going to talk about the voting rights decision that they came up with
[02:35.400 --> 02:39.440]  they put it out as a voting rights actually is taking away the ability of
[02:39.440 --> 02:46.760]  states to ask for proof of citizenship at the voting booths an amazing piece of
[02:46.760 --> 02:50.240]  overreach for them in the first place legislatively whether you agree with it
[02:50.240 --> 02:54.000]  or not we're gonna talk about some other Supreme Court decisions like their
[02:54.000 --> 02:58.800]  decisions on the shutting down the war on coal from the EPA that Obama was
[02:58.800 --> 03:02.800]  pushing them to do I agree with that decision but not the way they did it
[03:02.800 --> 03:06.040]  it's like when we had Lionel on the other day he was saying that he agreed
[03:06.040 --> 03:09.520]  with several of the issues but he didn't like the way they did it we have to
[03:09.520 --> 03:14.560]  maintain a rule of law if we go to a dictatorship you may like the way that's
[03:14.560 --> 03:18.000]  being dictated today but you're not going to like it tomorrow we cannot have
[03:18.000 --> 03:23.280]  the arbitrary rule of nine politically appointed judges for life who have been
[03:23.280 --> 03:27.920]  corrupted by this power like nine ring race we're also going to talk about the
[03:27.920 --> 03:31.120]  vaccination situation we're going to see people's reactions to we're going to
[03:31.120 --> 03:33.640]  talk about what's going to happen to that because there's going to be court
[03:33.640 --> 03:38.600]  challenges that may go all the way to the Supreme Court because we have seen
[03:38.600 --> 03:43.120]  that the Ninth District Court really doesn't respect privacy and individual
[03:43.120 --> 03:49.320]  freedom look at their decision on the confiscation of 30% of the crop of the
[03:49.320 --> 03:55.160]  raisin farmers that was okayed by the Ninth District Court the FDA for I
[03:55.160 --> 03:58.480]  guess it was right after World War two they started going in and saying we're
[03:58.480 --> 04:03.480]  going to take 30% of your crop you have nothing to say about it as we pointed
[04:03.480 --> 04:08.080]  out that's worse than serfs were treated in medieval times they only had to pay
[04:08.080 --> 04:13.360]  10% or 15% to their feudal lord no the FDA would just come in and confiscate
[04:13.360 --> 04:19.400]  30% of their crops no compensation the Ninth District Court said yeah that's
[04:19.400 --> 04:23.280]  okay so it had to go all the way the Supreme Court they ruled actually in
[04:23.280 --> 04:28.200]  that case they made an intelligent legal decision not just because I agree with
[04:28.200 --> 04:32.400]  it they actually referred to law they just didn't make a pronouncement we're
[04:32.400 --> 04:37.960]  also going to be joined in the second hour with Ben Fuchs as well as Anthony
[04:37.960 --> 04:41.580]  Gucci arty we're going to be talking about some vital health issues if you

[04:53.760 --> 04:57.520]  talking about these recent decisions
[04:57.520 --> 05:04.000]  John O'Connell the CEO of investment firm Davis Ray says Greeks are worried
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.080]  about martial law and civil war unless the country can pull out of its current
[05:08.080 --> 05:11.880]  economic crisis July 5th is the day where Greeks will come together and vote on
[05:11.880 --> 05:16.120]  whether to accept or reject an EU bailout package he claims the older
[05:16.120 --> 05:19.360]  generation will vote for the EU bailout because they have a lot to lose
[05:19.360 --> 05:22.840]  including their pensions while the younger people are already poor already
[05:22.840 --> 05:27.240]  unemployed and don't have much to lose he added that a tourism drop will have a
[05:27.240 --> 05:31.000]  big impact on the economy there have been some people that worried that the
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.200]  military may actually get involved it wouldn't surprise me there are some
[05:34.200 --> 05:37.120]  here in Greece that have raised the whole prospect of a potential civil war
[05:37.120 --> 05:40.360]  you can read more about this in the article CEO Greeks are worried about
[05:40.360 --> 05:43.840]  martial law and civil war by Paul Joseph Watson and if you're wondering what

[08:29.720 --> 08:34.960]  just here but all over the world tyranny is launching offensives on every
[08:34.960 --> 08:43.040]  front David Knight is going to be coming up breaking more of this down again I
[08:43.040 --> 08:48.520]  am your host Alex Jones incredible let me just mention the headlines I've got
[08:48.520 --> 08:53.760]  here ten commandment statue must be removed from state capital Oklahoma
[08:53.760 --> 08:59.400]  Supreme Court rules boom voting rights advocate gets when it's Supreme Court
[08:59.400 --> 09:03.680]  illegals can basically vote no proof of citizenship to be shown and you have
[09:03.680 --> 09:06.720]  states issuing driver's license anybody that wants them it's on
[09:06.720 --> 09:16.760]  California on the last day of June the 30th boom governor signed SB 277 for
[09:16.760 --> 09:20.480]  forced inoculation getting rid of the religious exemption this is a war on
[09:20.480 --> 09:25.000]  religious beliefs conscience you name it and then that dovetails with what we
[09:25.000 --> 09:32.880]  covered a lot yesterday Obama removes TPP's anti-slavery clause to still going
[09:32.880 --> 09:36.360]  on in Dubai and other areas then attacks Confederate flag a symbol of
[09:36.360 --> 09:41.440]  slavery and Obama issues 19 classified directives changing laws passed by
[09:41.440 --> 09:49.760]  Congress we're going to be going over all of this here in just a moment but
[09:49.760 --> 09:57.160]  when you look at this you can see that it's all being expanded so that we're
[09:57.160 --> 10:02.320]  hit with so much tyranny we can't respond to it it's a war on language a war on
[10:02.320 --> 10:07.520]  communication just as three top comics have recently come out Jerry Seinfeld
[10:07.520 --> 10:11.280]  and others and said political correctness is destroying language and the
[10:11.280 --> 10:15.760]  capability to even communicate these are liberals his 13-year-old daughter they
[10:15.760 --> 10:18.280]  said hey we're moving back to New York City so you can meet more boys and have
[10:18.280 --> 10:24.520]  more friends she said girls and boys together is sexist the word boys and
[10:24.520 --> 10:29.840]  girls is sexist brown bags are racist dig up Confederate generals get rid of
[10:29.840 --> 10:34.960]  their bodies this is the insanity that we're facing now now let's explain
[10:34.960 --> 10:39.360]  something we have a separation of church and state meaning the government
[10:39.360 --> 10:44.680]  cannot announce an official religion but they've expanded that violating the
[10:44.680 --> 10:47.440]  first amendment that says Congress shall make no law respecting an
[10:47.440 --> 10:50.360]  establishment of religion or prohibitive for exercise thereof they have
[10:50.360 --> 10:55.640]  expanded that ultra massively and twisted it to say at your commencement
[10:55.640 --> 11:00.400]  cheerfree speech you can read a poem of your speaking of you're the valedictorian
[11:00.400 --> 11:04.240]  or salutatorian you could talk about how you love your mom or your dad talk
[11:04.240 --> 11:08.480]  about how you love the principal love the school love track love field love
[11:08.480 --> 11:14.640]  football love Harry Potter love the moon goddess or love Jesus Christ or love
[11:14.640 --> 11:20.560]  Muhammad but now they say no you specifically can't talk about Christianity
[11:20.560 --> 11:28.800]  or Judaism everything else is accepted everything else is okay well now first
[11:28.800 --> 11:33.840]  story ten commandment statue must be removed from state capital Oklahoma
[11:33.840 --> 11:38.760]  Supreme Court rules AP Oklahoma Supreme Court said ten commandments monument
[11:38.760 --> 11:42.480]  state capital must be removed because it indirectly benefits the Jewish and
[11:42.480 --> 11:46.480]  Christian face in violation of the state's constitution the court ruled
[11:46.480 --> 11:50.440]  to see that the Oklahoma Constitution bans using public property to benefit a
[11:50.440 --> 11:55.400]  religion and the ten commandments are obviously religious in nature you know
[11:55.400 --> 12:03.440]  what's on the top of most major capitals it's called the goddess of Colombia you
[12:03.440 --> 12:08.680]  know the capital structure itself goes back to Greece and Rome and it was for
[12:08.680 --> 12:14.200]  temples to the goddess it is a breast the arched doorways this is mainline
[12:14.200 --> 12:18.560]  history are an entrance into the woman and that law comes out of the goddess
[12:18.560 --> 12:25.600]  these are temples are you gonna ban those Christmas trees are Germanic and
[12:25.600 --> 12:31.760]  druid trees that were brought in during the middle of winter to symbolize evergreen
[12:31.760 --> 12:35.280]  and the greenest would come back in the cold of the winter are you gonna ban
[12:35.280 --> 12:42.120]  Christmas trees everything has some religious connotation and connection and
[12:42.120 --> 12:47.040]  this is a war on ideas that can be selectively enforced where anything can
[12:47.040 --> 12:52.360]  be removed and it's very discriminatory they allow the druids and the pagans and
[12:52.360 --> 13:01.680]  the neo pagan groups the Wiccans to promote and to proselytize on basis but
[13:01.680 --> 13:05.160]  they don't let Christians do it there have been Texas cases and others where
[13:05.160 --> 13:08.240]  they find a little girl the Bible in her in her bag and they throw it away well
[13:08.240 --> 13:12.000]  she's allowed to have a Bible where she's allowed to have the lion the witch in
[13:12.000 --> 13:17.920]  the wardrobe in her which is also a Christian allegory in her back this is
[13:17.920 --> 13:24.160]  the persecution of free speech going on and the ignorance of the public where
[13:24.160 --> 13:29.920]  they're aware of every mindless imagined racist problem and if you don't go along
[13:29.920 --> 13:33.480]  with Obamacare and gun control your races as well it's the new religion but
[13:33.480 --> 13:38.080]  they're not aware of their basic freedoms this is unprecedented and it's all
[13:38.080 --> 13:42.880]  coming down with gay marriage marriage was an ancient institution every culture
[13:42.880 --> 13:47.120]  about men and women coming together if people want to have civil unions or
[13:47.120 --> 13:51.480]  states want to legalize it that's their issue but again it becomes a diversion
[13:51.480 --> 13:57.640]  and a distraction and also an overwrite a war against everything that was
[13:57.640 --> 14:03.360]  primal everything that was basic everything that makes a species this is a
[14:03.360 --> 14:07.360]  globalist overwrite their own words of culture and society breaking us down
[14:07.360 --> 14:12.400]  past the individual where we can't stand up for each other there's a war on
[14:12.400 --> 14:16.000]  fathers in all the media and all the culture and that's ultimately a war on
[14:16.000 --> 14:22.400]  women this is a destructive agenda sold as neoliberalism to free when
[14:22.400 --> 14:26.680]  actually it is to enslave when all of our other basic freedoms are being taken
[14:26.680 --> 14:30.400]  illegals can get free welfare and have their babies for free and they can vote
[14:30.400 --> 14:35.680]  Supreme Court and now California a few years ago passed a law that parental
[14:35.680 --> 14:40.040]  consent doesn't matter down down to age 11 they could give kids $200 discount
[14:40.040 --> 14:45.200]  cards if they would say I want to be inoculated and then the school comes in
[14:45.200 --> 14:49.400]  and says they make the decisions for your kid the pedophiles also want to
[14:49.400 --> 14:53.640]  move it down to age 11 and say that they can give consent well they can't
[14:53.640 --> 14:57.080]  because they're not grown up yet it's like you can't say well you're 11 year
[14:57.080 --> 15:00.000]  old one of me to give them a bottle of Jack Daniels you're contributing to the
[15:00.000 --> 15:05.560]  delinquency of a minor you don't have a right to push that on this is outsiders
[15:05.560 --> 15:09.420]  the state corporations control freaks wanting to run our children
[15:09.420 --> 15:15.120]  California vaccinations bill SB 277 signed by governor becomes law a
[15:15.120 --> 15:19.000]  California bill that removes all exemptions to vaccine requirements for
[15:19.000 --> 15:26.080]  school entry and then it goes in through the system this is unprecedented
[15:26.080 --> 15:28.840]  California bill that removes all exemptions to vaccine requirements for
[15:28.840 --> 15:33.120]  school entry except those medically indicated has just become law after
[15:33.120 --> 15:37.160]  being passed through the assembly on Thursday and the state Senate passed the
[15:37.160 --> 15:42.760]  same version it's now been signed by governor Jerry Brown into law they want
[15:42.760 --> 15:47.920]  to make us take hundreds of vaccines this is so precedent setting and now
[15:47.920 --> 15:51.000]  they know more and more doctors are coming out saying vaccines are dangerous
[15:51.000 --> 15:54.200]  don't give them to pregnant women and stuff like that read the inserts so
[15:54.200 --> 15:57.440]  hospitals are ordering doctors and medical centers are ordering doctors
[15:57.440 --> 16:01.640]  that they aren't allowed to say vaccines are dangerous taking control of
[16:01.640 --> 16:05.520]  medical decisions from you and your doctor that's what Obamacare that's
[16:05.520 --> 16:11.080]  really corporate screw you care is and here's an example of that KXAN here in
[16:11.080 --> 16:16.920]  Austin Texas where info wars comes to you Austin Regional Clinic won't accept
[16:16.920 --> 16:20.960]  unvaccinated children strengthening vaccination policy post measles
[16:20.960 --> 16:25.280]  outbreak that killed no one but they hyped it up they have a secret vaccine
[16:25.280 --> 16:28.720]  fund they've paid out to tens of thousands of people whose kids died they
[16:28.720 --> 16:33.440]  keep that very quiet though it's admitted but no one dies from measles the
[16:33.440 --> 16:37.280]  measles bumps and rebellious shot admits it can give you type 1 diabetes they
[16:37.280 --> 16:40.680]  claim is genetic but it can give you diabetes the insert openly says that
[16:40.680 --> 16:44.000]  give you all these other diseases neurological disorders you name it and
[16:44.000 --> 16:47.560]  now they're going to intimidate you when you come in and your kids already sick
[16:47.560 --> 16:52.000]  and you want to get health care and they go show us the records or will refuse
[16:52.000 --> 16:56.800]  care talk about do no harm and now they're going to try to force it this is
[16:56.800 --> 17:02.360]  a war on people's freedom the answer is find the clinics find the vaccine
[17:02.360 --> 17:06.160]  choice clinics in your area and support them fight them with your dollars and
[17:06.160 --> 17:10.040]  the free market there is a full out war against choice a full out war against
[17:10.040 --> 17:14.520]  freedom a full out war against sovereignty a full out war against cash the
[17:14.520 --> 17:18.440]  global meltdown is coming and they're getting it lined up to use it to bring
[17:18.440 --> 17:25.760]  in full control and finally Leanne McAdoo made this point on the nightly news
[17:25.760 --> 17:33.200]  Jerry Brown when SB 277 hits your desk this is what he said when he was in
[17:33.200 --> 17:39.400]  office the last time in 2011 he's been in office three times back in now he said
[17:39.400 --> 17:44.560]  the California members of the state Senate on a bicycle helmet for kids they
[17:44.560 --> 17:48.040]  wanted to put parents in jail if your kid didn't wear a bicycle helmet he said
[17:48.040 --> 17:52.000]  while I appreciate the value of wearing a ski helmet I am concerned about the
[17:52.000 --> 17:55.600]  continuing and seemingly inexorable transfer of authority from parents of
[17:55.600 --> 17:59.040]  the state not every human problem deserves a law I believe parents have
[17:59.040 --> 18:03.160]  the ability and responsibility to make good choices for their children what
[18:03.160 --> 18:09.520]  changed now the big vaccine makers came in they literally pumped in hundreds of
[18:09.520 --> 18:14.000]  millions of dollars not just here but all over the world Australia countries in
[18:14.000 --> 18:19.640]  Europe they're banning kids 11 years old playing their backyards now this is the
[18:19.640 --> 18:24.520]  end of parents this is the end of freedom this is the total takeover of
[18:24.520 --> 18:28.280]  society and then that ties into what David Knight's gonna come up and be

[18:42.920 --> 18:46.280]  bigger than ever as your curry Jackson broke down a few weeks ago in a report
[18:46.280 --> 18:51.680]  and then that ties into his 19 classified directives that he signed a few days
[18:51.680 --> 18:56.960]  ago that are secret not only do they rule by executive fiat now but what's in

[24:11.960 --> 24:18.600]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this Wednesday July 1st 2015 the year is
[24:18.600 --> 24:23.000]  going pretty quickly we're gonna talk about what's gonna come up in 2016 in
[24:23.000 --> 24:28.640]  just a moment the government is going to be putting forth real ID you don't know
[24:28.640 --> 24:32.160]  what that is we'll tell you about it but you're going to need to have real ID
[24:32.160 --> 24:36.520]  now your driver's license to fly nevertheless the Supreme Court just
[24:36.520 --> 24:42.800]  said that we cannot ask for any proof of citizenship when people vote get your
[24:42.800 --> 24:47.440]  head around that kind of inconsistency we're gonna talk about the non legal
[24:47.440 --> 24:51.160]  basis of the Supreme Court decision as well as the non legal basis of their
[24:51.160 --> 24:56.000]  decision against the EPA and their regulations coming from the Obama
[24:56.000 --> 25:00.480]  administration to shut down coal plants that was something that has been that's
[25:00.480 --> 25:05.400]  an objective a goal of Obama since before he was elected while he was running
[25:05.400 --> 25:10.320]  he was looking to shut down the coal industry I'm glad that they have not
[25:10.320 --> 25:15.440]  done it at this moment but when you look at the the logic that the Supreme Court
[25:15.440 --> 25:19.080]  came up with it's equally troubling whether you agree with them on the
[25:19.080 --> 25:22.760]  issues or not that's the point we look at their decision on marriage their
[25:22.760 --> 25:28.160]  decision on Obamacare their decision on coal on voter ID none of it makes any
[25:28.160 --> 25:33.320]  sense from a legal perspective it is just raw edicts and that's what we're
[25:33.320 --> 25:38.480]  seeing from Obama this is very troubling this is a an article that is on a New
[25:38.480 --> 25:44.680]  American Obama issues 19 classified directives changing laws that have been
[25:44.680 --> 25:49.440]  passed by Congress okay now this is from the New American they say since being
[25:49.440 --> 25:54.400]  inaugurated in 2009 President Obama has issued 30 presidential policy directives
[25:54.400 --> 26:02.680]  PPDs PPDs not to be confused with TPPs these are PPDs 19 of which he has ordered
[26:02.680 --> 26:06.680]  to keep secret from Congress and the American people but like the TPP the
[26:06.680 --> 26:12.200]  PPDs are also secret we're not allowed to see them we're just supposed to obey
[26:12.200 --> 26:17.720]  them Congress can't see them either like the TPP now USA Today breaks us down
[26:17.720 --> 26:22.400]  they say of the 30 issued by him 19 have not been released 11 of those a
[26:22.400 --> 26:27.040]  White House is not disclosed even what the subject is we're not even allowed to
[26:27.040 --> 26:31.520]  know what the subject is let alone the details of this they say and this is USA
[26:31.520 --> 26:36.760]  Today this is this is quote-unquote your mainstream media here it's not only the
[26:36.760 --> 26:42.280]  public that doesn't have copies it's also Congress that doesn't have copies they
[26:42.280 --> 26:46.840]  said they have the same legal force as an executive order they form a body of
[26:46.840 --> 26:54.400]  largely secret law how could we have secret law in this country isn't that
[26:54.400 --> 26:59.760]  an oxymoron no it isn't quite frankly because the law is not there to do
[26:59.760 --> 27:04.280]  anything other than entrap you in this society continuing on with what they say
[27:04.280 --> 27:08.800]  this is from a political scientist who advised Congress on national security
[27:08.800 --> 27:13.000]  directives before he retired from the Congressional Research Service he said
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.680]  the differences that while executive orders are public by law in other words
[27:16.680 --> 27:20.560]  they must be published in the federal register before they become effective the
[27:20.560 --> 27:27.480]  PPDs the presidential policy directives are not published he says it's kind of a
[27:27.480 --> 27:31.920]  secret law people have to obey it but it's a directive that can allocate money
[27:31.920 --> 27:37.080]  it can direct people or it can take a course of actions see and post modern
[27:37.080 --> 27:45.040]  America post constitutional America we have secret laws we have secret treaties
[27:45.040 --> 27:50.560]  that are about to come down the pike and then we have even secret courts you
[27:50.560 --> 27:56.240]  know the FISA court meets in secret they make decisions that they say modify the
[27:56.240 --> 28:01.280]  Constitution I would say no I disagree with Marbury versus Madison just like
[28:01.280 --> 28:05.960]  Jefferson did the Supreme Court gave themselves that power so they they have
[28:05.960 --> 28:08.840]  a Supreme Court decision says you know we've decided we've decided that we're
[28:08.840 --> 28:14.600]  going to set in judgment as the final arbiter of whether or not any law can
[28:14.600 --> 28:18.960]  be used or whatever a president does no we have division of power that's
[28:18.960 --> 28:23.000]  precisely what the founders of this country were concerned about that's why
[28:23.000 --> 28:28.080]  they not only divided power amongst the states that had created the central
[28:28.080 --> 28:31.560]  government they were worried that that creature of the states was going to
[28:31.560 --> 28:35.640]  become a Frankenstein monster even though Frankenstein hadn't been written by
[28:35.640 --> 28:40.640]  Mary Shelley at that point had people understood that was something that could
[28:40.640 --> 28:45.200]  happen so they divided power as well as they could amongst kept power retained
[28:45.200 --> 28:48.840]  power I should say by the states that had created the central government
[28:48.840 --> 28:52.920]  retained power by the people that had created the states and the central
[28:52.920 --> 28:56.440]  government and then within the central government they divided power that's why
[28:56.440 --> 29:00.920]  when the Supreme Court made their decision about the second National Bank
[29:00.920 --> 29:05.720]  of the United States Andrew Jackson said well they've made their decision let's
[29:05.720 --> 29:11.520]  see them enforce it we need to have that kind of attitude from people today we
[29:11.520 --> 29:17.320]  need to have people elected to office that understand that they are not at the
[29:17.320 --> 29:22.960]  mercy of these nine ring race at the Supreme Court who have been totally
[29:22.960 --> 29:29.440]  corrupted by power power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely we see
[29:29.440 --> 29:34.840]  that with them we see that with Obama and his secret laws we can't even know
[29:34.840 --> 29:40.480]  what the subjects are stay with us we're going to also talk about the TPP both
[29:40.480 --> 29:45.440]  from the perspective of Obama's endorsing slavery within the TPP and
[29:45.440 --> 29:49.520]  what's happening in Greece stay with us we'll be right back we're on the March
[29:49.520 --> 29:57.280]  the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:58.680 --> 30:02.200]  do you think you might be on a terror watch list because you don't like what
[30:02.200 --> 30:05.520]  the government's doing well you might be right in the article law enforcement
[30:05.520 --> 30:08.680]  more concerned about anti-government activists than al-Qaeda terrorists Kurt
[30:08.680 --> 30:11.720]  Nemo writes about a study conducted by the Triangle Center on Terrorism in
[30:11.720 --> 30:14.680]  Homeland Security that reveals law enforcement agencies in the United
[30:14.680 --> 30:17.720]  States are more concerned about anti-government extremists than al-Qaeda
[30:17.720 --> 30:21.440]  or ISIS inspired terrorists they perceive violent extremism to be a much
[30:21.440 --> 30:24.760]  more severe threat nationally than the threat of violent extremism in their
[30:24.760 --> 30:28.400]  own jurisdictions the report reads law enforcement agencies in the United
[30:28.400 --> 30:32.440]  States consider anti-government violent extremists not radicalized Muslims to be
[30:32.440 --> 30:35.720]  the most severe threat to political violence that they face this comes on
[30:35.720 --> 30:39.040]  the heels of House Democrats demanding that the Obama administration issue an
[30:39.040 --> 30:42.880]  updated assessment on the dangers posed by violent right-wing extremist groups
[30:42.880 --> 30:46.040]  and provide the Department of Homeland Security with more resources to deal
[30:46.040 --> 30:49.120]  with the supposed threat so I guess if you're a conservative that doesn't like
[30:49.120 --> 30:51.960]  the government arming ISIS then you might be a threat to the government

[35:37.400 --> 35:42.160]  pronouncements that have come out and I'm still still reeling from reading this
[35:42.160 --> 35:47.840]  story about Obama's presidential policy directives the PPD's these are things
[35:47.840 --> 35:51.840]  that go even beyond executive orders because we're not even allowed to know
[35:51.840 --> 35:55.760]  what the subjects of these executive orders are so they're like executive
[35:55.760 --> 35:59.960]  orders except their secret Congress doesn't know what they are we're not
[35:59.960 --> 36:04.680]  allowed to know what they are but we must obey them see a problem with that I
[36:04.680 --> 36:09.920]  do I see a lot of problems with that and you know when I look at this I have the
[36:09.920 --> 36:15.080]  same reaction that Jeff sessions I don't know if it's I get their names mixed up
[36:15.080 --> 36:18.320]  there's a congressman sessions and there's a senator sessions senator
[36:18.320 --> 36:24.880]  sessions took a look at the trans-pacific partnership and what he told us
[36:24.880 --> 36:30.080]  about it he was absolutely appalled he said I'm just breathless as to what's
[36:30.080 --> 36:33.680]  going on with this and I got to say that's the way I feel this last week I
[36:33.680 --> 36:38.800]  am just breathless with the insanity and with how quickly everything is moving
[36:38.800 --> 36:42.600]  with all of this hopefully it's going to wake people up hopefully people will see
[36:42.600 --> 36:47.000]  that this is something that has been rolling out for a very long time and I
[36:47.000 --> 36:50.840]  want to talk about what's going on with Greece in just a moment and go back to a
[36:50.840 --> 36:55.800]  book that Alex Jones wrote back in 2002 he mentioned it briefly yesterday and
[36:55.800 --> 36:59.840]  there was a transcript in there of an interview that he had with Greg Palast
[36:59.840 --> 37:04.480]  and he was talking about interviews that he had had with Joe Stiglitz
[37:04.480 --> 37:09.920]  Joe Stiglitz has something to say about Greece that is very relevant to today to
[37:09.920 --> 37:14.080]  what's going on with the bankers there as well as with these trade agreements and
[37:14.080 --> 37:18.800]  I want to pull that in but before we do I want to get back to the TPP from the
[37:18.800 --> 37:23.440]  the story here about the anti-slavery clause now this is an article that came
[37:23.440 --> 37:29.040]  out yesterday evening from Kit Daniels he points out that right before Obama
[37:29.040 --> 37:33.800]  publicly attacked the Confederate flag as a symbol of slavery President Obama
[37:33.800 --> 37:39.480]  quietly removed an anti-slavery provision from the Trans-Pacific Partnership
[37:39.480 --> 37:44.600]  Trade Agreement this partnership bars countries that engage in slavery from
[37:44.600 --> 37:48.320]  being part of major trade deals with the US it was written by Senator Bob
[37:48.320 --> 37:52.520]  Menendez from New Jersey this is a report from the Huffington Post they say at
[37:52.520 --> 37:56.960]  the insistence of the White House however Menendez agreed to modify his
[37:56.960 --> 38:02.120]  language to say that as long as a country is taking quote concrete steps
[38:02.120 --> 38:07.880]  unquote towards reducing human trafficking and forced labor it can still be a
[38:07.880 --> 38:11.280]  part of the trade deal now the reason they had to do this is because they want
[38:11.280 --> 38:17.000]  to get Malaysia and Malaysia is a major source of cheap labor and it's also a
[38:17.000 --> 38:21.560]  major source of human trafficking in Southeast Asia they have enslaved men
[38:21.560 --> 38:26.600]  women and children subjected to forced labor and sex track of trafficking
[38:26.600 --> 38:29.600]  according to the State Department according to this article that Kit
[38:29.600 --> 38:35.120]  Daniels has and the Huffington Post asks why in the year 2015 is a White House
[38:35.120 --> 38:39.680]  teaming up with Republican leaders essentially to defend the practice of
[38:39.680 --> 38:46.760]  slavery but that's okay because that's being done quietly publicly Obama is
[38:46.760 --> 38:51.440]  going to the black churches singing amazing grace he is removing the
[38:51.440 --> 38:55.680]  Confederate flag because that is all about slavery he says well you know
[38:55.680 --> 39:01.080]  actually Lincoln didn't even start the war to end slavery he started the war
[39:01.080 --> 39:04.920]  to stop secession if you go back and read some of the original stuff you'll
[39:04.920 --> 39:08.760]  see they're not calling the people in rebellion they called them rebels but
[39:08.760 --> 39:13.160]  mostly they called them secession you know Lincoln didn't free the slaves with
[39:13.160 --> 39:18.800]  the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 that happened in 1865 they finally
[39:18.800 --> 39:23.960]  freed the slaves of Ulysses S Grant and if you're historically challenged he
[39:23.960 --> 39:28.880]  was the commander of the Union forces and he had slaves on his farm his wife's
[39:28.880 --> 39:35.000]  farm until 1865 when they were outlawed when the amendments went through to do
[39:35.000 --> 39:39.120]  that now that was a 13th amendment the 14th amendment said that they were going
[39:39.120 --> 39:45.760]  to extend due process to the freed slaves in 1870 they extended voting rights
[39:45.760 --> 39:49.960]  specifically to the slaves so they did these things in the steps of progression
[39:49.960 --> 39:55.920]  because they had to explicitly put it in there they they weren't these these
[39:55.920 --> 40:00.400]  different rights were not being given to the freed slaves and it's kind of
[40:00.400 --> 40:03.640]  interesting when you look at the Supreme Court decision that came out this
[40:03.640 --> 40:11.080]  week where they threw out Arizona and Kansas's voter IDs they had a policy
[40:11.080 --> 40:15.160]  that they would request proof of citizenship before someone could be
[40:15.160 --> 40:19.680]  added to the voter registration rolls and the Supreme Court says no you don't
[40:19.680 --> 40:22.800]  need to do that they can just tell you they're citizens and that's okay you
[40:22.800 --> 40:29.160]  know really is it okay if I just tell the TSA don't worry I'm a citizen I'm not
[40:29.160 --> 40:31.840]  a threat you don't need to see any documents you know these are not the
[40:31.840 --> 40:36.240]  drones you're looking for just let me through no that doesn't work anywhere
[40:36.240 --> 40:41.560]  else if I refuse to give a police officer my ID when he requests it or
[40:41.560 --> 40:46.000]  demands it I'm gonna wind up face down on the concrete in most situations that's
[40:46.000 --> 40:50.200]  what we've seen that's the rules that the federal government is putting out as
[40:50.200 --> 40:55.800]  they federalized police enforcement but you know when we look at voting this is
[40:55.800 --> 41:01.480]  something that was never defined in the Constitution who gets to vote so there
[41:01.480 --> 41:04.960]  were definitions that with it we had three amendments that have been put in
[41:04.960 --> 41:12.040]  the Constitution to clarify that in 1870 they added an amendment to allow
[41:12.040 --> 41:16.880]  people to vote regardless of race color or previous condition of servitude so
[41:16.880 --> 41:22.680]  that was 1870 50 years later 1920 allowed the right to vote regardless of sex I
[41:22.680 --> 41:26.240]  gave women the right to vote then in 1970 another 50 years interesting these
[41:26.240 --> 41:33.960]  were like 50 years apart they have the voting age lowered to 18 years and quite
[41:33.960 --> 41:38.680]  frankly they did that because they were sending men off to die and not allowing
[41:38.680 --> 41:43.200]  them to vote in the wars they were drafting people at 18 years of age so
[41:43.200 --> 41:45.800]  you know just like the Constitution doesn't say you've got freedom of
[41:45.800 --> 41:50.160]  speech or freedom of religion it just says you have those because those rights
[41:50.160 --> 41:54.400]  come from God that's what the Declaration of Independence tells us you
[41:54.400 --> 41:59.600]  possess those rights as a human being so the Constitution is there to say you're
[41:59.600 --> 42:05.840]  not going to infringe on those rights on any kind of basis not on basis of race
[42:05.840 --> 42:09.680]  not on the basis of sex or age that's why we had those three amendments now we
[42:09.680 --> 42:14.920]  come back 45 years after this last one where they gave the vote to 18 year olds
[42:14.920 --> 42:19.160]  and the Supreme Court doesn't go through the usual process because when you look
[42:19.160 --> 42:23.880]  at these three amendments they were each 50 years apart they all had a format to
[42:23.880 --> 42:29.000]  them they all came in and they said the right they had two parts section one the
[42:29.000 --> 42:34.080]  right of citizens the US to vote shall not be denied or bridged because of
[42:34.080 --> 42:40.400]  fill-in-the-blank race sex age okay that was the first part the second part said
[42:40.400 --> 42:44.520]  Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate
[42:44.520 --> 42:48.360]  legislation in other words Congress can't write laws when they don't have
[42:48.360 --> 42:54.000]  jurisdiction over something but see we're at the point now where the Supreme
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.480]  Court doesn't even wait for Congress to write the laws on things that they don't
[42:58.480 --> 43:02.040]  have jurisdiction the Supreme Court makes pronouncements on things that even
[43:02.040 --> 43:06.240]  the that the federal government in no branch has jurisdiction over and that's
[43:06.240 --> 43:12.280]  what they have done by saying we cannot verify who citizens are because in each
[43:12.280 --> 43:17.640]  of these amendments it was citizens of the United States have the right to vote
[43:17.640 --> 43:21.840]  and cannot be a bridge because of this it is citizens who have that right but
[43:21.840 --> 43:27.280]  of course the Supreme Court doesn't need to be bothered with that they will just
[43:27.280 --> 43:33.520]  make their little declaration because as I said before these are nine kings and
[43:33.520 --> 43:40.480]  queens with the ring of power who have essentially become Nazgul ring race
[43:40.480 --> 43:45.280]  remember Lord the Rings the men who took the power as kings and they were
[43:45.280 --> 43:50.920]  corrupted by it that's what we have seen that's what everyone was always
[43:50.920 --> 43:55.720]  concerned about Lord Acton who said power corrupts and absolute power corrupts
[43:55.720 --> 43:59.960]  absolutely they were concerned he was concerned and his contemporaries who
[43:59.960 --> 44:04.800]  founded this country were concerned about the consolidation of power about
[44:04.800 --> 44:09.920]  people becoming arbitrary dictators what is a dictator a dictator is someone
[44:09.920 --> 44:15.360]  who says the law is in my mouth essentially he dictates what that law is
[44:15.360 --> 44:20.480]  and that's what we have now except of course you have the presidential policy
[44:20.480 --> 44:24.760]  directives where we cannot even see what the dictates are because those are
[44:24.760 --> 44:33.720]  secret laws yes we have truly gone to a corrupt government where the the Emperor
[44:33.720 --> 44:37.200]  has no clothes and one of the things that they have to do with us of course is
[44:37.200 --> 44:42.400]  to make sure that they remove all the foundations historical legal of our
[44:42.400 --> 44:47.560]  country that's what's really behind this removal of the Ten Commandments in
[44:47.560 --> 44:52.040]  Oklahoma as well as other places we have monuments at the Supreme Court when
[44:52.040 --> 44:55.560]  we talked about the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta we talked about how
[44:55.560 --> 44:59.640]  that was one of the panels on the door of the Supreme Court they put monuments
[44:59.640 --> 45:03.680]  up to talk about this is where our laws came from we have this long tradition so
[45:03.680 --> 45:10.080]  forth and so on and many of the states refer directly to the Magna Carta we
[45:10.080 --> 45:13.520]  also have a foundation we talk about America being a Christian nation that
[45:13.520 --> 45:16.480]  doesn't mean that the majority of people were Christians although they were
[45:16.480 --> 45:20.400]  doesn't mean that the founders the majority of the founders were Christians
[45:20.400 --> 45:25.360]  although they were what it means is is that our laws were based on that
[45:25.360 --> 45:30.160]  philosophically ethically that was the foundation and that's what people are
[45:30.160 --> 45:34.360]  putting these monuments up but we have to take the monuments down because we
[45:34.360 --> 45:40.960]  are removing the foundations of our country we are headed into a Mordor
[45:40.960 --> 45:47.080]  when we give this kind of power to these people I want to talk about what's
[45:47.080 --> 45:51.840]  going on in Greece next because it is very confusing today they did are
[45:51.840 --> 45:56.200]  yesterday they defaulted on a 1.7 billion dollar IMF payment so they are now
[45:56.200 --> 46:01.480]  technically in default to the IMF but then we see this just a couple of hours
[46:01.480 --> 46:06.640]  ago from CNN money where Greece does an about face on the bailout I want to
[46:06.640 --> 46:11.200]  play the clip of that in just a moment here but they say this is CNN money just
[46:11.200 --> 46:15.040]  a couple of hours ago they say whoa the Greek government is now ready to sign
[46:15.040 --> 46:19.360]  on to a bailout package it threw out just days ago but the about face won't
[46:19.360 --> 46:24.160]  fix the country's crisis anytime soon and this is what Alexis Cyprus the
[46:24.160 --> 46:27.560]  Prime Minister wrote he said Greece is prepared to accept this staff level
[46:27.560 --> 46:30.920]  agreement subject to the following amendments additions or clarifications
[46:30.920 --> 46:36.840]  it was first reported this morning by the financial time so just as we can't
[46:36.840 --> 46:40.720]  really tell what they're doing and this happened on Sunday dredge report put out
[46:40.720 --> 46:46.320]  a tweet and they said Sunday morning the Greek Finance Minister says we would
[46:46.320 --> 46:50.960]  never institute cash controls that's antithetical to everything we believe
[46:50.960 --> 46:55.440]  and then by that evening they've closed the banks for a week we say yesterday
[46:55.440 --> 46:59.160]  that they're going to they defaulted technically on this and now Greece
[46:59.160 --> 47:03.240]  doesn't abrupt about face today so I'm not really sure nobody was really sure
[47:03.240 --> 47:08.320]  what's going on with this there is some heavy-handedness it's not just the the
[47:08.320 --> 47:13.280]  Greek government that is vacillating all over the place but it is also the
[47:13.280 --> 47:18.040]  banks the IMF that are playing hardball with the people of Greece and I want to
[47:18.040 --> 47:23.960]  tie this in to what's going on with the bankers what's going on with the trade
[47:23.960 --> 47:28.560]  agreements because this all ties together with crony capitalism with the
[47:28.560 --> 47:33.040]  multinational control of our economies look at this article that came out today
[47:33.040 --> 47:39.040]  from Paul Joseph Watson there's a report from someone on Twitter Alex Andreo says
[47:39.040 --> 47:43.480]  that the IMF is ordering US tour operators to withhold payments to Greek
[47:43.480 --> 47:51.920]  hotels he says to crush us is their aim so they don't want US tour operators to
[47:51.920 --> 47:55.560]  actually pay these private companies who provided the services who need the
[47:55.560 --> 48:01.640]  money so that they can exist no we're going to take that says the IMF they
[48:01.640 --> 48:06.000]  say the measure illustrates how the IMF is prepared to impose draconian capital
[48:06.000 --> 48:10.520]  controls directly on Greek private business owners in order to recover
[48:10.520 --> 48:16.480]  their debt they say if this is true it's disgraceful if the IMF is exceeding
[48:16.480 --> 48:20.360]  their authority I hope they get sued wrote one respondent to the report this
[48:20.360 --> 48:25.040]  is pure thuggery added another this is what the people of Greece are going
[48:25.040 --> 48:28.760]  through you got Greek pensioners people who retired they're going to the banks
[48:28.760 --> 48:32.800]  trying to grab their cash they say in chaotic scenes thousands of elderly
[48:32.800 --> 48:37.760]  Greeks on Wednesday today besieged the nation's crisis hit banks which reopened
[48:37.760 --> 48:42.160]  to allow them to withdraw vital cash from their state pensions they say Athens
[48:42.160 --> 48:46.240]  has now reopened almost a thousand bank branches for three days to allow
[48:46.240 --> 48:52.840]  pensioners without cards to withdraw $133 to last them the rest of the week now
[48:52.840 --> 48:56.600]  here's one guy he says he's I'm a retired sailor he asked not to be identified
[48:56.600 --> 49:01.760]  he told the AFP he had no cash to buy crucial medicine for his sick wife he
[49:01.760 --> 49:09.520]  said I worked for 50 years on the sea now I am a beggar for 120 euros I took
[49:09.520 --> 49:14.720]  out the 120 euros but I have no money for medication for my wife who had an
[49:14.720 --> 49:20.440]  operation and is sick that's the situation there and you know we have I
[49:20.440 --> 49:26.560]  have my parents had given me had told me stories about when they were children
[49:26.560 --> 49:30.880]  through the depression some of you perhaps you heard that from your
[49:30.880 --> 49:37.360]  grandparents who are younger than me we don't have any direct experience of this
[49:37.360 --> 49:42.520]  but we should be very concerned that we are going to have a direct experience of
[49:42.520 --> 49:46.480]  this now of course there's also a referendum coming up the BBC news
[49:46.480 --> 49:50.320]  pen of the referendum you can see that here on the screen get a picture of
[49:50.320 --> 49:53.840]  this referendum of course it's all Greek to me it's all written out in Greek and
[49:53.840 --> 49:59.040]  the characters completely different so you can't read it it's very simple but
[49:59.040 --> 50:03.440]  they felt that it was a little bit hard to understand essentially is like do you
[50:03.440 --> 50:08.920]  want to sign on to the plan that the IMF is putting out there they said they
[50:08.920 --> 50:11.320]  didn't think that anybody could understand it however there's an
[50:11.320 --> 50:15.560]  interesting article from Joseph Stiglitz on the Guardian and he says how I would
[50:15.560 --> 50:20.600]  vote in the Greek referendum he says neither alternative approval or
[50:20.600 --> 50:25.560]  rejection of the Troika's terms will be easy both carry huge risks now I'm gonna
[50:25.560 --> 50:31.160]  tell you what Joseph Stiglitz said and then I want to read you what Greg
[50:31.160 --> 50:37.040]  Pallas talked about back in 2002 with Alex Jones we have a transcript of that

[54:19.000 --> 54:23.960]  Greece is technically in default we don't really know what's going on at the
[54:23.960 --> 54:30.400]  moment there's a referendum coming up on July the 5th we've had reports that the
[54:30.400 --> 54:36.000]  Greek government has now reversed their position and is offering to accept some
[54:36.000 --> 54:40.440]  of the deals that have been made to them but I want to talk to you about the
[54:40.440 --> 54:44.360]  opinions of Joseph Stiglitz on this referendum that's coming up on July 1st
[54:44.360 --> 54:50.360]  because it has applications to all of us now he is someone who had worked for the
[54:50.360 --> 54:57.360]  World Bank and back in 2002 Alex Jones had a an interview with Greg Palast who
[54:57.360 --> 55:02.560]  talked about conversations that he had with Joseph Stiglitz and about some of
[55:02.560 --> 55:05.960]  the whistle-blowing activities at the time we'll get to that in just a moment
[55:05.960 --> 55:10.680]  before we do here's what Joseph Stiglitz says about how he would vote if he was
[55:10.680 --> 55:15.360]  voting in the Greek referendum he says in terms of transforming a large primary
[55:15.360 --> 55:19.760]  deficit into a surplus few countries have accomplished anything like what the
[55:19.760 --> 55:22.320]  Greeks have achieved in the last five years because there's a lot of back and
[55:22.320 --> 55:25.840]  forth as to who's at fault or the Greeks at fault are they living a
[55:25.840 --> 55:31.520]  profligate lifestyle or is this something that is kind of a rope a dope by
[55:31.520 --> 55:37.280]  the large banks now this is a guy who worked for the Troika banks for the
[55:37.280 --> 55:42.120]  central banks for the World Bank this is what he says he says this has been done
[55:42.120 --> 55:45.480]  through cost in terms of human suffering that's been extremely high the Greek
[55:45.480 --> 55:49.560]  government's recent proposals went a long way toward meeting its creditors
[55:49.560 --> 55:54.240]  man he said we should be clear almost none of the huge amount of money loaned
[55:54.240 --> 55:59.080]  to Greece has actually gone to Greece it has gone to pay out private sector
[55:59.080 --> 56:03.280]  creditors including German and French banks Greece has gotten only a pittance
[56:03.280 --> 56:09.240]  but it has paid a high price to preserve those countries banking systems the IMF
[56:09.240 --> 56:14.160]  and other official creditors do not need the money that is being demanded now he
[56:14.160 --> 56:17.480]  goes on to break this down to what a yes vote would mean and what a no vote would
[56:17.480 --> 56:20.920]  mean here's what he says from a yes vote from his opinion and this is a guy who
[56:20.920 --> 56:26.400]  has worked for the IMF and World Bank Troika large central bankers he says a
[56:26.400 --> 56:31.240]  yes vote would mean depression almost without end perhaps a depleted country
[56:31.240 --> 56:35.200]  one that has sold off all of its assets whose bright young people have
[56:35.200 --> 56:39.600]  immigrated who might finally get debt forgiveness perhaps having shriveled
[56:39.600 --> 56:45.400]  into a middle-income economy Greece might finally be able to get assistance from
[56:45.400 --> 56:49.240]  the World Bank and that might happen in the next decade or the decade after
[56:49.240 --> 56:53.400]  that he says in contrast however a no vote would at least open the
[56:53.400 --> 56:58.000]  possibility that Greece with its strong democratic tradition might grasp its
[56:58.000 --> 57:03.200]  destiny in its own hands Greeks might gain the opportunity to shape a future
[57:03.200 --> 57:08.280]  that though perhaps not as prosperous as the past is far more hopeful than the
[57:08.280 --> 57:14.000]  unconscionable torture of the president he says I know how I would vote we've
[57:14.000 --> 57:17.200]  had a lot of people say that so Jim Rogers say that he said that I just say
[57:17.200 --> 57:21.760]  look we're not going to cover the banks we're not going to and understand to
[57:21.760 --> 57:27.280]  that what's happening with these proposed plans that some of the money is
[57:27.280 --> 57:31.280]  going to go directly to the IMF in terms of bailing this out but for the most
[57:31.280 --> 57:35.980]  part money is going to be coming from sovereign countries like Greece and
[57:35.980 --> 57:40.320]  France to pay off the bankers in other words they're going to be assuming
[57:40.320 --> 57:45.360]  Greece's sovereign debt into their countries because we can't have the
[57:45.360 --> 57:51.680]  bankers ever lose any money so it's going to be on some countries balance sheet
[57:51.680 --> 57:54.400]  and once they do once they get it on their balance sheet then the bankers
[57:54.400 --> 57:59.200]  come around and go you know you've got a pretty high debt to income ratio now I
[57:59.200 --> 58:01.800]  think we're going to have to raise your interest rates this is the same thing
[58:01.800 --> 58:07.240]  they do to new college graduates give you a credit card rope a dope here try
[58:07.240 --> 58:12.600]  this credit card create a new entitlement system here and then once
[58:12.600 --> 58:15.440]  you do this yeah you're getting in over your head I think we're going to have to
[58:15.440 --> 58:18.960]  jack up that interest rate looks like you know that just isn't going to make it
[58:18.960 --> 58:23.000]  that's precisely what they're doing stay with us when we come back I'm going to
[58:23.000 --> 58:30.120]  read you what was said about this in 2002 and it applies precisely to what we see
[58:30.120 --> 58:32.920]  happening with the Trans-Pacific Partnership stay with us we'll be
[58:32.920 --> 58:35.280]  right back

[58:55.840 --> 59:00.120]  website info wars.com because the companies I've been approached by were
[59:00.120 --> 59:04.680]  not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be so I

[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:12.280]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:19.800]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:28.240]  Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex Jones show in this July 1st 2015 I'm
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:32.200]  David Knight your host joining us in the next segment will be pharmacist Ben
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.560]  Fuchs as well as Anthony Guterri we're gonna be talking about some health
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:41.840]  issues now is a good time to talk about that because we've just had a violation
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:46.880]  of our informed consent to something that has some real potential to do damage
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:51.200]  throughout this country and of course it's not just mandatory vaccines we're
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:56.840]  seeing everywhere that the government is mandating that we buy their favorite
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:59.920]  corporations products they're no longer just government sponsors they're no
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:07.040]  longer just using crony capitalism to burden the competitors of their friends
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:12.400]  with regulations no now they're directly holding a gun to our head and that's
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:17.200]  essentially what's going on with these secret trade treaties we talked earlier
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:21.080]  in the program about how we not only have you know we have the FISA court that
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:24.120]  has its secret court rulings that they say modify the Constitution but we're
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:28.800]  not allowed to see those we have a secret trade treaty that is going to
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:32.720]  change everything economically and politically but we're not allowed to see
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:39.520]  that and then of course Obama has got his secret presidential policy directives
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:42.120]  that we're not even allowed to know what the subjects are but they have the same
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:49.200]  effect as executive orders this is absolutely insane but we see the
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:53.960]  Impers we know that they have no clothes we know they have no authority to do
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:02:00.120]  this this however as senator Sessions said is becoming breathtaking and his
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:04.560]  implications we've been talking about Greece and that in this last segment
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:08.320]  before we go to pharmacist Ben Fuchs and Anthony Gucci already I want to finish
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:13.240]  up talking about this and go back to an interview in 2002 there's a transcript
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:16.640]  in this book 9-11 descent into tyranny it's a book that was written by Alex
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:21.920]  Jones you can get the PDF of it if you are a prison planet TV subscriber that's
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:25.560]  what I did I looked at this interview and it's very interesting because they were
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:32.400]  talking about a debriefing an interview some documents that Greg Palace had
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:36.960]  gotten involving Joe Stiglitz and I just read some excerpts about Joe Stiglitz
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:41.200]  analysis of the current Greek situation here's some of the excerpts he had this
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:45.840]  again this is back 2002 13 years ago he says and this is Greg Palace telling
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:49.680]  Alex Jones he said I spoke to the former chief economist Joe Stiglitz who
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:54.600]  was fired by the World Bank so I on BBC with the Guardian basically spent some
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:58.260]  time debriefing him he wouldn't give me inside documents but other people handed
[01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:03.280]  me a stash of secret documents from the World Bank and the IMF and then Greg
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:07.200]  Palace goes on to say we found inside these documents that basically they
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:12.440]  required nations to sign secret agreements in which they agreed to sell
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:17.000]  off their key assets in which they agreed to take economic steps which are
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.720]  really devastating to the nations involved and if they didn't agree to these
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:26.240]  steps there was an average for each nation that signed 111 items that they
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:29.440]  would be required to sign on to if they didn't follow those steps they would be
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:33.480]  cut off from all international borrowing you can't borrow any money on the
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:36.480]  international marketplace no one can survive without borrowing whether your
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:40.600]  people or corporations or countries without borrowing some money having some
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:44.040]  credit liquidity that's what they're doing right now with the bank holiday
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.760]  they're shutting it down people can't get their mom their own money out of the
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:50.840]  bank because of that then he goes on he says I've got inside documents recently
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:55.480]  from Argentina this is back in 2002 he said the secret Argentine plan this is
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:04:00.080]  signed by Jim Wolfenson the president of the World Bank and he says they've not
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.680]  challenged the authenticity of the documents he said at first they did
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:06.040]  first they said those documents don't exist I actually show them on television
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:10.800]  that's what happens all the time they'll always deny that the documents exist and
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:14.360]  then when you show them enough times and say okay now they exist but they don't
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:17.240]  mean what these guys are saying because they figure people won't read them well
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:21.480]  here's what he said they said he said the problem is we have look he said the
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:26.120]  IMF and the World Bank is 51% owned by the US government by the US Treasury so
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:30.320]  the question becomes what are we getting for the money that we put into there and
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:35.360]  it looks like we're getting mayhem in several nations Indonesia's in flames he
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:38.480]  says a chief economist Stiglis was telling me that he started questioning
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:41.280]  what was happening says you know everywhere we go every country we end up
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:45.040]  meddling in we destroy their economy they end up in flames and he was saying
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:49.320]  they kind of question this and he got fired for it but he was saying the even
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:52.960]  kind of plan the riots they know when they squeeze a country and destroy its
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:56.200]  economy there's going to be riots in the street they know capital runs away
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:59.240]  from your country that gives them the opportunity for the IMF to add more
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:03.480]  conditions they will be right back brought to you by the FBI whose agents
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:07.400]  are telling friends and family to avoid 4th of July celebrations and you know
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:10.840]  what that means that means if you're an FBI informant or a friend of an FBI
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:13.800]  informant you better not go anywhere this weekend because you're probably going
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:18.160]  to be set up why do I say that back in 2012 the New York Times published an
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:22.280]  article terrorist plots hatched by the FBI which details how FBI informants
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:26.160]  were recruiting people for terror plots which were then busted by the FBI and
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:30.560]  remember back in February an FBI official said we need to keep fair alive
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:34.640]  to justify terror budget the quote is from a documentary entitled the New
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:38.000]  Berg Sting which tells how the feds convinced four poverty-stricken New
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.120]  York men to become involved in an informant-led terror plot the paid FBI
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:45.480]  informant is alleged to have offered the destitute men a quarter of a million
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:49.600]  dollars to execute an attack we'll be talking about this and more on the
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:53.360]  info wars nightly news tonight so celebrate the 4th of July but not if
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:56.240]  you're an FBI informant
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:01.720]  ladies and gentlemen you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers and
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:05.360]  sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:09.880]  info wars dot com because the companies I've been approached by were not the
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:13.760]  highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be so I
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:18.440]  refused probably 30 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then

[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:17.360]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:21.040]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host joining me in
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:25.760]  this segment is pharmacist Ben Fuchs and Anthony Gucci Artie from Natural
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:29.600]  Society we're going to talk about a lot of vital health issues we've got a lot
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:33.680]  of different topics to talk about one of the first ones I want to talk to Dr.
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:39.040]  to pharmacist Ben Fuchs about is the South Carolina shooter was reported to
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:44.840]  have been on suboxone subutexed what is the implication of that we always have
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:50.240]  the central government coming out pressing for gun control as well as the
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:53.480]  people in all the states after every one of these shooting events they never
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:09:00.920]  look at the thing that is the underlying connection and that is the psycho drugs
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:04.920]  that they're on whether it is SSRIs or whether it's something like suboxone
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:08.200]  suboxone is something that's a little bit different than we've seen with most
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:12.640]  of these other shooters so I want to get pharmacist Ben Fuchs opinion on that
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:16.000]  before we do we'll let you know this segment of the Alex Jones show is brought

[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:12.520]  good to see you Anthony thank you for joining us as I said we got a lot of
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:16.720]  different topics to talk to you about first one I wanted to talk to you
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:21.680]  about though was this drug that South Carolina shooter was on tell us as a
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:27.160]  pharmacist what you know about this drug suboxone yes suboxone is a combination
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:31.680]  drug it's partially something called well butrin perhaps you've heard of that
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:37.120]  and then the other component is an opiate like drug opiate like substance
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:41.320]  the combination is used as is used recreationally this kid Dylan Roof was
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:45.600]  using it recreationally that's something we see a lot with these these people
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:52.000]  that quote go postal as you know shoot things up they seem to always be on some
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.480]  sign of some kind of psychopharmacology and what it really highlights is the
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:01.800]  fact that you can't mess around with the brain with pharmacology you know for
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:05.760]  the longest time even doctors looked down their nose at the practice of
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:10.640]  psychiatry and even today many well-meaning medical professionals feel
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:15.200]  like psychiatry is kind of a pseudo science it's based in pseudo science
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:18.800]  and that's because there's no real diagnostic measurements for whether
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:23.360]  somebody is psychiatric has a psychiatric problem it's all based on
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:28.160]  conjecture and speculation and even the diagnostics they that they use is based
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:32.920]  on something called the DSM the dive diagnostic and statistics manual book
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:38.920]  which gets updated regularly to include by the way diagnoses like oppositional
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:42.920]  defiance disorder internet shopping do you know what I'm saying yeah oh yeah
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:53.000]  they want to characterize me as odd you know because I have an oppositional
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.680]  defiance disorder interesting but you know what that means you could be drug
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:00.280]  officially and your insurance company will will pay for the drugs in fact
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:03.720]  there are cases when you have a diagnosis from a so-called medical
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:07.000]  professional of oppositional defiance disorder where you can be medicated
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.800]  against your will yes test to calm you down from this horrible disease internet
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:17.120]  shopping disorder etc these crazy diagnoses the point is is you key with
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:20.720]  any pharmacology with any drug you're playing with fire the human body is not
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:24.680]  meant to be manipulated this way and when I talk about pharmacy pharmaceuticals
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:28.600]  being poisons I'm saying that not rhetorically and not poetically but I'm
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:33.680]  saying it literally these things suppress biochemistry and for some reason or
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:38.600]  another we have been hypnotized to believe that we can somehow be better we
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:43.160]  can somehow have our health improved by suppressing our biochemistry now this
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:48.120]  has implications in the human body in terms of the the viscera in terms of the
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:51.840]  digestive system and the heart and the blood pressure etc but it has really
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:55.920]  really egregious effects when we start to play with the brain this way the brain
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:01.240]  is most complex or complex living system in the universe and to start to drug it
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:06.400]  to start to poison it to use pharmacology to manipulate it is fraught
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:10.760]  with danger can cannot help but lead to problems like all the things that we're
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:13.680]  seeing in terms of aggressive behavior and violent behavior let me say one
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:17.520]  more thing there's these class of drugs called serotonin reuptake inhibitors and
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:22.160]  I know you know about these SSRIs and this is a new class of drugs relatively
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:27.640]  new came out about 25 25 years ago I think the late 1980s these serotonin
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:31.440]  reuptake inhibitors exploit or leverage the misunderstanding that people have
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:35.560]  around this drug this neurotransmitter this chemical serotonin you know David
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:38.680]  and Anthony many people feel like serotonin based on what they've heard
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:42.680]  is a happy hormone right it's anti-depressant hormone makes you feel
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:46.960]  like life is good well as it turns out and that's not the case the serotonin
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:51.680]  is a vigilance hormone it's an awareness hormone it is the alternative or the
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:55.880]  antagonistic hormone to melatonin as most people know melatonin helps you
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:58.720]  relax helps you fall asleep well serotonin does the exact opposite
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:02.520]  serotonin is a daytime and vigilance hormone and when you start to up regulator
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:06.760]  you manipulate the levels of serotonin artificially to raise serotonin levels
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:11.840]  which is what these reuptake inhibitors do you get these hyper vigilant states
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:16.920]  and hyper vigilance is the same as paranoia and this is why aggressive
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:21.600]  behavior violent behavior paranoid behavior school shootings etc are all
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:25.720]  associated with up regular artificially up regulating serotonin levels the
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:29.280]  bottom line here is if you have brain chemistry issues neurotransmitter issues
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:32.360]  if you want to work with your brain chemistry most powerful medicine in the
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:36.600]  world for manipulating brain chemistry is called food and it's or it's called
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:41.200]  non-food if you will and by non-food I'm talking about corporate swill as I like
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:44.360]  to call it which is the processed food that is pretty much rammed down our
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:48.640]  throats 24-7 via marketing and via commercials if you want to manipulate
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:53.040]  your brain chemistry in a healthy fashion pay attention to the foods you're
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:56.760]  eating and pay attention to the foods you're not eating yes that's very true
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:02.120]  and of course many of the ancient Greek doctors wisely said let food be your
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:06.560]  medicine they understood how that would affect people and we're talking about
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:11.280]  these SSRIs I think one of the the scariest things about it to me is how
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:15.480]  it affects people while they're on it but then if someone decides that they
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:18.920]  want to get off of this because of side effects or because of long-term health
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:23.320]  issues or something once they get off of it then everything goes really crazy
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:27.200]  that's right you had you end up with these withdrawal symptoms and that's
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:31.360]  another another danger that's associated with psychopharmacology is
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:35.440]  withdrawal from these drugs and that alone tells you about the potent nature
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:40.240]  of these substances David and Anthony how the heck did we ever get the idea
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:44.360]  that we can manipulate our body biochemically through pharmacology and
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:49.000]  somehow be better for it how did we extrapolate from antibiotics and
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.240]  pain pills which by the way are very important and praise God that we have
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:55.280]  pain pills and to a certain extent antibiotics as well although now we're
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:59.840]  we're reaping the harvest of antibiotic resistance which you know
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:02.640]  anybody who understood how these things work could have predicted and my
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:07.000]  pharmacy school professors did predicted three decades ago so leaving that aside
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:12.840]  the fact that aside from pain pills and antibiotics how the heck did the potency
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:17.000]  and the importance of pain pills and the life-saving potential antibiotics get
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.280]  extrapolated to using prescription drugs for every single ailment that we have
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:24.720]  for degenerative diseases and for psychiatric disorders and for weight
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:29.560]  loss and all of the things that we apply pharmacology to how do we get from the
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:34.200]  point from where the pain pills and and antibiotics save lives to the to the to
[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:39.120]  four billion four billion prescriptions served and I would present to you that
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:42.520]  it comes through through marketing through branding through advertising
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:47.320]  through routes of the routes of administration that have nothing to do
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:51.320]  with patients and nothing to do with bettering our health and everything to
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:55.400]  do with the corporatocracy and profit margins and to me this is one of the
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:17:00.040]  most egregious one of the nastiest ways that humanity is being manipulated is
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:04.760]  through pharmacology in an effort to number one reap profits and centralized
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:08.120]  money but number two control the population you know I would agree with
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:11.960]  that and I would also say it is marketing and it is propaganda and what
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:15.840]  they're pushing though is two things first they're ignoring the research the
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:20.600]  real research that the gut is really the center of all mental activity there's a
[01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:23.840]  deep connection between the gut and the brain as you know we want to talk about
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:27.800]  that today specifically and things you can do to enhance your mental health
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:32.000]  through redistributing gut health with microflora and everything like that but
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.120]  secondarily there is this lie that there is a biological free lunch with
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:40.040]  pharmaceutical drugs right I mean just take pain killers you'll feel better
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:44.080]  and everything's fine or just take SSRIs and you'll be happier and you'll have
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:47.440]  increased serotonin and blah blah blah and everything will be fine there's no
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:51.320]  discussion of the negative side effects and the reality that with you when you
[01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:54.800]  put something in your body a biochemical reaction is going to occur
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:58.680]  even if it's something good I mean you can have too much of a good thing but
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:01.480]  these pharmaceutical drugs are not too much of a good thing they're too much of
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:05.960]  a bad thing and you're trying to use them to get a free lunch when it does not
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:10.200]  exist you cannot just be happier or feel better from pain killers and expect it
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:13.960]  to go on forever something devastatingly bad is going to happen to maintain
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:19.040]  equilibrium in your body yeah exactly what what Ben Fuchs is just saying about
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:23.720]  four billion prescriptions served made me think of McDonald's you know this is
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:28.080]  McFarma and you combine that with the junk food you the junk drugs everything
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:32.000]  one of the things that I'm concerned about of course is this mandatory vaccine
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.080]  bill that just went through in California and of course you're talking
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:38.920]  about how they're magnifying the pharmaceuticals for every condition I
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:43.360]  see that happening now with vaccines and of course they have every financial
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:48.360]  incentive to do that because they have no liability for anything that happens if
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:52.160]  it's a vaccine if it's an antibiotic or it's other pharmaceuticals they have
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:57.760]  liability but not with vaccines that this is a very scary situation it truly
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:03.080]  is corporatism out of control that's government in your blood is what it is
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:06.600]  you see the blood is the sacred space the Bible we hear the blood is the life
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:10.920]  all disease I say this a lot I say my radio program my presentations I say all
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:14.560]  disease is cell disease because I want people to understand that there's no
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:17.640]  difference in the diagnosis and the different types of diseases whether it's
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:22.720]  Alzheimer's disease or osteoporosis or a fatty liver disease or whatever it all
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:26.160]  at the end of the day is a cell matter and it doesn't matter where the disease
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:29.320]  process shows up because it's all happening at the level of a cell but
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:33.760]  even more fundamentally if all disease is cell disease all cell disease is blood
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:38.080]  disease and cells begin to break down when the blood becomes dirty you know
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:41.640]  doctors will talk about something called sepsis and they'll say well if you have
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:44.200]  sepsis that's a life-threatening condition you end up in the ICU you
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:47.600]  could end up kept end up dying and they're correct with acute sepsis but
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:51.480]  with chronic long-term sepsis and sepsis means dirty blood hang on is a

[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:22.080]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and joining me as pharmacist
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:27.200]  Ben Fuchs and Anthony Gutiardio natural society we started out talking about the
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:31.720]  effects of suboxone that was the drug that the South Carolina shooter was on
[01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:36.560]  just before we went to break we had started talking about gut health and I
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:41.640]  think you had a question that you wanted to ask Ben Fuchs about Anthony that's
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:44.880]  right so I'm always been passionate about gut health because I've understood
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:48.320]  for a long period of time I mean I remember in 2011 reading a study and
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:52.840]  writing an article that antibiotics were wiping out microflora good bacteria in
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:56.760]  the gut and as a result they were acknowledging at that point that their
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:00.560]  immune systems of the immune systems of individuals on high dose of antibiotics
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:04.040]  was being completely shut down and then that ties into another article recently
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:07.800]  it was a study from a college student he was eating McDonald's every day for
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:11.920]  like two weeks you heard about this one yeah and his good bacteria was
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:15.680]  permanently destroyed by eating McDonald's I mean permanently that means
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:19.160]  he would have to supplement with probiotics or eat fermented foods to
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:23.880]  regain that bacteria if that even even if those strains are applicable and then
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:27.520]  you know Ben is funny you sent over these articles to talk about today one of
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:30.800]  these from Science Daily is decreased social anxiety among young adults who
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:35.000]  eat fermented foods and missing link found between brain immune system major
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.560]  disease implications I mean how long have we known about this this is not new
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:42.480]  the gut has always been at the center of the immune system and towards mental
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:46.560]  health and I think the biggest thing and my question to you is some of solutions
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:49.600]  for people and I'd love to get into them as well I know about four or five
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:54.000]  things everybody should be doing let's talk about that for a minute how really
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.400]  all these people think they're depressed and even schizophrenics a lot of the
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:01.400]  times what happens is their gut health is just in shambles so my question to you
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:06.400]  is let's talk about that for a minute oh man not sometimes all the time autism
[01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:10.040]  schizophrenia mental health issues pretty much all of them have a digestive
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:13.200]  health component and that's why it's so important number one to start to
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:16.120]  supplement with good bacteria probiotic supplements are probably the most
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:18.760]  important supplements you could use them by the way for anybody interested in
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:22.200]  learning more about supplementation or using supplements or getting on a good
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:25.880]  nutritional supplement program check out info wars health comm info wars health
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:34.080]  comm or call 888-789-927-7888-789-9277 ask them about the probiotic products the
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:38.840]  bioluminescence product in particular the fucoid Z product and liquid
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:42.320]  nutritional supplements and this is these three these three factors all play a
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:46.080]  very important role when it comes to gut health number one the bacteria in the
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:49.880]  gut and this is so fascinating Anthony I love how you caught on to this because
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:55.160]  this is where the digestive system this is where bodily health begins to
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:58.920]  break down at the digestive system level first I call this the triangle of
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:04.760]  disease and it begins in utero in the womb for many people and then it really
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:09.080]  heads into the disease process in earnest believe it or not when we're born why
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:15.120]  because for most of us when we're born we don't get the the the breast milk that
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:19.080]  we need that nurtures and sustains these bacteria and for a lot of folks who
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:24.320]  are born cesarean section and one out of three births are cesarean now the baby
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:29.480]  doesn't get the the the benefit of the bacteria that are supposed to coat the
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:33.560]  baby at the the fetus as it comes through the womb cesarean sections
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:37.600]  bypass this coating and then the baby's not breastfed from that point forward the
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:42.520]  gut bacteria become compromised so the the breakdown process the physiologic
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:45.640]  breakdown process begins at the digestive system level and it begins
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:50.240]  woefully early now second important concept when it comes to helping the
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:56.200]  gut is to use liquid nutrition and by that I mean soups and juices and liquid
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:28:00.400]  nutritional supplements using I talk about bone soup where you take a chicken
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:03.960]  and you drop it into a pot and you let the meat dissolve into the water and
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:07.080]  you let the cartilage dissolve into the water very very important for the immune
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:11.640]  system also vegetable juices get yourself a high-powered blender and making
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:16.720]  sprout juices and broccoli juices and cabbage juices are powerful ways to help
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:20.800]  support gut health and then finally using liquid nutritional supplement drinks
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:24.520]  is a great way to bypass digestive problems and get high-powered nutrients
[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:29.320]  right into the gut especially brain nutrients the brain is especially
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:33.720]  dependent on water soluble nutrition specifically electrolytes and the B
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:37.800]  vitamins it's of course also important dependent on fat soluble nutrients but
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:42.520]  the problem with the water soluble nutrients is we excrete them when we
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:46.520]  urinate and if they're not replaced on a regular basis it's very easy to become
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:50.600]  deficient in these substances and so replacing your water soluble nutrients in
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:53.800]  a liquid fashion throughout the day can be not only important for the entire body

[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:48.080]  Fuchs is gonna come back with us with some more excellent advice also we have
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:53.480]  Anthony Guterres in the Natural Society the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:57.040]  the GCN radio network
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:02.120]  do you think you might be on a terror watch list because you don't like what
[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:05.440]  the government's doing well you might be right in the article law enforcement
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:08.600]  more concerned about anti-government activists than al-Qaeda terrorists Kurt
[01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:11.640]  Nemo writes about a study conducted by the Triangle Center on Terrorism and
[01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:14.600]  Homeland Security that reveals law enforcement agencies in the United
[01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:17.600]  States are more concerned about anti-government extremists than al-Qaeda
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:21.600]  or ISIS inspired terrorism they perceive violent extremism to be a much more
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:24.720]  severe threat nationally than the threat of violent extremism in their own
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:28.320]  jurisdictions the report reads law enforcement agencies in the United
[01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:32.240]  States consider anti-government violent extremists not radicalized Muslims to
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:35.720]  be the most severe threat to political violence that they face this comes on the
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:38.920]  heels of House Democrats demanding that the Obama administration issue an
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:42.800]  updated assessment on the dangers posed by violent right-wing extremist groups
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:45.920]  and provide the Department of Homeland Security with more resources to deal
[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:49.040]  with the supposed threat so I guess if you're a conservative that doesn't like
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:52.480]  the government arming isis then you might be a threat to the government rob do

[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:31.080]  Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and joining me are Anthony Gutiarty from
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:35.640]  natural society and pharmacist Ben Fuchs earlier in the program I was talking
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:39.240]  about how the Supreme Court's jumping out of its jurisdictional boundaries but
[01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:44.360]  typically the way that happens is with bureaucracies we've seen the FCC assert
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:48.000]  its control over the internet recently and now we see some very troubling signs
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:53.280]  that the FDA is going to start making moves against nature pass nature of
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:58.160]  naturopathy I guess is how you say it but that's right we've also seen them
[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:00.800]  coming after supplementation but of course they're not going to say anything
[01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:05.120]  Anthony about GMOs they're going to give that a pass but they're going to come
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:10.120]  after natural treatments natural sub supplements what do you know about this
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:13.040]  other than the fact that this is something we've seen the government do
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:17.360]  before all this regulation is in the same vein and then the same line as the
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:21.560]  TPP right they know they're losing the battle because Monsanto for example is
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:26.920]  losing money last of course fourth quarter 2014 shedding money losing 128
[01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:31.080]  million I believe it was McDonald's is losing so much money now every single
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:34.560]  month that they won't report on their losses anymore that's how bad it is from
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:38.000]  McDonald's so they are already losing the battle and their only answer now is
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:42.160]  if they can't just credit it if they can't put out phony studies about how
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:46.640]  organic is the same as conventional which they tried to do by hiring one of
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:50.200]  the people that believe it or not was one of the guys that stood up for big
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:53.840]  tobacco saying that cigarettes didn't cause heart cancer disease that's right
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:57.720]  right so they tried that and now it didn't work organic is booming like
[01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:02.520]  crazy I've talked to the farmers they're forced to import international organic
[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:05.800]  produce because they can't keep up with the demands here well that's how big it
[01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:08.320]  is so what they're going to do is they're going to try and force it down our
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:11.000]  throats they're going to come in with the regulations the first they're going to
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:15.280]  get the naturopaths right because it's a small sector it's a small group but if
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:18.200]  they can get them then they can go towards even alternative medicine in
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:22.960]  general and specifically the TPP of course would ban Gmail labeling and
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:26.400]  Monsanto is more than happy about that obviously that's the way they're going to
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:29.040]  do it because of the fact that we are winning the battle they're going to
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:33.240]  start banning everything regulating everything and just taxing us out until
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:36.080]  they believe they can shut us down by force because they already tried
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:38.840]  intellectually and we won that battle yeah they don't even want to fight it at
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:41.840]  the local level they want to fight at the national level they just had France
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:49.040]  ban glyphosates and so they can they can go with this transnational committee
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:53.120]  with their investor state arbitration process and they can say hey if you're
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:57.000]  going to put labels on our products they've already done this with some
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:01.960]  regional trade agreements in Australia they changed the labeling on tobacco and
[01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:06.560]  they said well that's hurt our sales so pay up billions of dollars that's the
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:09.160]  way they're going to do it they're going to hold that gun to the head of the
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:12.240]  individual countries and of course at the country say no we're not going to do
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:15.520]  that then they're going to say well then you're going to be excluded from
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:20.320]  trading with the rest of the world we're going to put confiscatory tariffs on
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:23.240]  goods coming in and out of your country we're going to kick you out of this
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:26.680]  trade agreement that's the kind of gun and the leverage that they've got on
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:31.960]  that Ben Fuchs what are your comments here's the bottom line we don't need the
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:35.080]  government we don't need naturopaths for that matter we can do all this
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:39.520]  ourselves you know the human body is a healing system the human body knows how
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:42.440]  to heal the human body knows how to repair itself the human body knows how
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:46.000]  to build what we have to be doing if we're not feeling as well as we should
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:50.600]  or somehow not accessing these built-in systems is number one simplify and that
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:55.600]  means focus on food focus on blood sugar and focus on oxygenation making sure
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:58.400]  you're oxygenated between food blood sugar and oxygen you have the three
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:02.440]  major causes of bodily breakdown and lack of health from a physical
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:05.680]  perspective now the emotional and the most the emotional mental aspects and
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:08.760]  even as ultimately spiritual aspects always need to be addressed but from a
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:13.800]  physiologic perspective between the digestive system the blood sugar system
[01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:19.120]  and oxygenation you have the three major causes of disease and the three major
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:23.320]  ways that we stay healthy none of which require the medical model none of which
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:27.800]  require naturopath none of which require obama care or any government
[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:32.280]  intervention between eating less food patching up the gut making sure we stay
[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:35.960]  away from sugar in the corporate swill making sure we're oxygenating correctly
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:39.000]  and getting on a good nutritional supplement program we can do it ourselves
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:43.160]  with the with the divine force that's built into all of ourselves and built
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:48.000]  into the human body so I to me I don't pay attention to what the government is
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.320]  doing I take care of my own business and my own business when it comes to my
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:55.160]  health or the health of my families to make sure we're eating correctly we're
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:57.440]  on a good nutritional supplement program we're staying away from the
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:01.280]  corporate swill and we're oxygenating by sitting on the couch and practicing
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:04.880]  slow deep breathing on a regular basis not to mention using psychological
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:08.400]  mental emotional as well as spiritual strategies for health none of which
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:12.800]  require the government that's a great that's a great point yes absolutely as
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:16.520]  long as they don't prohibit or force stuff on us that's the thing that we're
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:20.160]  concerned about we look at them taking away our informed consent of course
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:23.880]  there's two different sides of that one of them is they can force you to take
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:27.960]  things and then the other part of it is that they can prohibit you from getting
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:31.320]  access to certain things that's that's something we're always worried about
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:33.720]  that's what you were talking about before the break we're talking about dirty
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:37.440]  blood you know all disease is preceded by dirty blood the blood is the sacred
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:40.520]  space nothing is supposed to get into the blood unless it's been vetted and
[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:45.720]  this is the problem with vaccinations they bypass the body's safety mechanisms
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:49.560]  for protecting itself for protecting the blood and stuff gets right injected
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:54.200]  right into the bloodstream this is this is very dangerous stuff and if there's a
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:58.360]  major epidemic of some kind you need a vaccination that's one thing but to have
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:02.400]  a series of vaccinations that you're just going to stick into a human being's
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:06.560]  bloodstream willy-nilly it's playing with fire it's not right and for the
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:12.080]  government to compulse people to to comply is is just absolutely egregious
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:15.880]  and we really need to be doing something in terms of speaking up and
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:18.600]  fighting about this I don't know how it got through in California I really don't
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:22.960]  how do people accept this in California I don't know how this thing passed well
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:27.120]  you know these bills appeared all across the country we had 20 of them here in
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:30.400]  Texas and we're able to shut those down what they're doing is they're
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:34.360]  ostracizing people they're ostracizing people putting us off into ghettos
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:37.240]  whether it's our jobs whether it is school they're saying well you still
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:40.960]  have a choice you know you can stay in this little ghetto that we're going to
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:45.120]  create for you or you can take what we're going to demand that you take in
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:49.160]  order to move around in society that's the the really awful way that they're
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:53.600]  handling this Anthony you had something you wanted to ask Ben Fuchs about yeah
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:56.640]  you know you talk about informed consent and you talk about the government
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:00.000]  kind of not paying attention what they're doing I would love to be with you
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:03.920]  on that my my biggest issue is that so many people don't know what they're
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:07.040]  eating you know they have no idea what the government is allowing in their food
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:10.680]  because it's not on the labeling right they don't know they're eating GMOs they
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:13.360]  don't know they're eating high fructose corn syrup which is full of mercury
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:16.560]  because they change it to corn syrup or they can't change it to corn sugar
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:20.400]  whatever it is and it's about this article too that you sent over few people
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:24.600]  heading towards diabetes know it right so few people heading towards every
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:28.640]  disease know it no one knows it they just wake up one day and they're they're
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:32.640]  crying they say you know if something's wrong go to the doctor oh oh my god I
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:36.320]  have cancer it's almost like they had no idea and I've talked to people who have
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:39.720]  diabetes and they say to me over and over again I mean I was eating healthy I
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:43.680]  said well what were you eating oh you know I was I was eating fruit every now
[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:47.760]  and then I was I was eating those lean cuisine meals or whatever you know total
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:51.960]  total junk that's full of additives that are known to cause diabetes and killing
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:56.040]  the gut flora and they don't know it so you know how many people do you think
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:41:00.320]  are thriving themselves with bad things and giving themselves diseases right
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:03.920]  now and have no idea it's a big problem a first of all you have to be a label
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:08.120]  rear but you can't even go by that one of the most important health strategies
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:12.200]  you could use to get to your point here to address your point is eating less
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:16.760]  food and also fasting and not participating in fast food and lean
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:20.000]  cuisine you know if it comes in a box you probably don't want to eat it if they
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.200]  sing a song you know in the commercial you definitely don't want to eat if
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:26.960]  there's a cartoon character you want to run okay they don't put cartoon characters
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:30.600]  they don't sing songs for broccoli or for whole foods and of course even
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:34.080]  broccoli with pesticides and with soil depletion isn't going to be isn't going
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:37.120]  to be the same nutritional is going to have the same nutritional pack the same
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:40.440]  nutritional punch as broccoli should but it's a lot better than lean cuisine
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:46.080]  and packaged foods it's very difficult to get quality food in once a food has
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:51.240]  been or get quality once a food has been processed the processing process
[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:57.040]  degrades food quality and once we start ingesting or living primarily on these
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:59.920]  kinds of foods there's no way that we're not going to be exhibiting nutritional
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:03.480]  deficiencies if it comes if it comes in a box it comes in a package if it's
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:07.440]  heavily marketed or heavily advertised that's a food you want to stay away from
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:11.120]  and eating less food is another strategy a very important strategy technically
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:15.600]  they call that caloric restriction and study after study after study shows that
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:21.440]  inflammation drops the immune system improves energy levels improve longevity
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:26.720]  increases cancer symptoms decrease autoimmune symptoms decrease simply by
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:32.720]  eating less food we live in an empire of food where people make billions and
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:36.000]  trillions of dollars off of the kind of food choices that we make the food
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.960]  industry the processed food industry is a trillion dollar business in fact
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:44.080]  fortune magazine has a great cover story this month on the food on the food
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:47.760]  processing industry talking about how they're being forced to become more
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:53.320]  responsive to consumers demands for for good food for organic food etc nonetheless
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:57.080]  the less food we eat the less we interface with food processors and with
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:00.880]  with packaged food goods and fast food for that matter the better off we're
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:04.680]  going to be you know it's really crazy to because the same time in our
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:08.760]  primal brains we see an apple and I've talked about this because it's so crazy
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:12.320]  before you see an apple and you immediately assume it's healthy I mean
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:15.400]  you're just wired that way you see broccoli like you're saying you think
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:20.040]  it's healthy but in this new food paradigm that's not the case I mean on
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:25.520]  average no whites apple right right I mean you could eat organic potato chips
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:29.480]  that are probably more healthy than that apple not just because it's lost its
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:33.840]  nutrients but because it's been sprayed with DDT or 2-4d or something like
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:36.240]  that that is known to be giving you cancer and the Wealth Health
[01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:40.520]  Organization just announced that last week by the way DDT four times increase
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:44.600]  in breast cancer gives you cancer 2-4d also across the board gives you cancer
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:49.520]  so this apple that you're eating is not just an apple and it's actually hurting
[01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:53.160]  you and killing you if it is in fact sprayed with these chemicals versus
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:57.120]  something like even a potato chip and that's the crazy world we live in this
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:00.400]  these days and it's so challenging to explain to people you know they modify
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:04.280]  things even like roses you know they've modified them for appearance to where
[01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:08.280]  they've lost their fragrance and you look at this with with apples they don't
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:12.080]  want them to spoil they want long shelf life and they want it to look good so
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:16.520]  they're doing everything they can to manipulate that genetic modification so
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:19.560]  they don't turn brown when you cut them I mean you know you name it it's it's
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:23.480]  all there it's hard to know what to eat it's almost impossible that's why the
[01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:26.760]  less you eat the better off you are you know for take a big breakfast for
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:29.960]  example you know most people think oh you got to eat a big breakfast right you
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:32.880]  got a even that you have to eat breakfast where did that come from where
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:36.520]  did the bacon and egg come bacon and egg breakfast come from the traditional
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:39.560]  breakfast that we all indulge in every morning where did that come from what
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:43.480]  came from Edward Bernays the guy who wrote the book propaganda back in the
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:49.640]  1920s who was Sigmund Freud's nephew you know we get propagandized into eating
[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:53.120]  behaviors we get propagandized into eating certain foods the food pyramid is
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:57.000]  a classic example of that or the food plate as they call it the food pyramid
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:00.680]  the food plate is not based on the kind of foods we eat it's based on lobbying
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:04.440]  groups and it's based on what lobbying groups and in the dairy industry and the
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:10.240]  meat industry and the processed food industry what they have decided that
[01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:13.720]  is important for us to eat based on their profit margin so you're absolutely
[01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:17.640]  correct it's almost impossible to know what to eat the best strategy is to eat a
[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:23.400]  lot less food and eat simply and not just eat less calories but to eat less
[01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:27.680]  processed food so when you talk about apples and you talk about fruits you
[01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:30.320]  know these things are obviously genetically modified but they've been
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:33.920]  genetically modified for eons and they've been especially been genetically
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:37.740]  modified to have lots of sugar in them to be super sweet you know those apples
[01:45:37.740 --> 01:45:41.340]  that apple that beautiful apple that's on the screen now that didn't exist 300
[01:45:41.340 --> 01:45:46.880]  years ago or 400 years ago apples were little crab apples and we grew up on
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:51.080]  small pieces of fruit we grew up on fruit that didn't have a lot of sugar in
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:55.360]  them sugar for many for many millennia wasn't available it's only been the
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:58.180]  last two or three hundred years that it's been available and what what's
[01:45:58.180 --> 01:46:01.280]  happened is because we have these hard-wired drives for certain foods
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:05.200]  specifically sweets and sugars and for calories as well
[01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:11.160]  profit-profit driven corporations have learned to pray and to exploit these
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:15.400]  hard-driven draw hard-wired drives you know that old commercial you I bet you
[01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:18.640]  can't eat just one they were laughing at us of course you can't eat just one
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:23.880]  because it's the potato chips are spiked with chemicals that compulse us to
[01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:29.360]  to keep eating until the bag is gone so taking control of our eating behaviors
[01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:33.160]  as simple as that sounds is so fundamental to good health it's so
[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:37.280]  fundamental to liberating us from a corporate government corporate paradigm
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:41.680]  that could care less about us or could care less about our families and could
[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:45.960]  care more about extracting our funds from us not participating in the corporate
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:50.640]  swell not participating by eating the corporate swell driving by not driving
[01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:54.960]  through as I like to say yeah you know you see that all the time it used to be
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:59.200]  that years ago when I used to watch television I'm really my family doesn't
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:02.800]  watch any more seemed like all the commercials were food commercials fast
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:05.800]  food commercials try to get you to munch you know if you got something or
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:09.200]  refrigerator or go out and get something but of course now most of the
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:13.120]  commercials are pharmaceutical commercials that's the amazing thing
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:17.400]  David the food processing industry and the pharmaceutical industry and the
[01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:21.240]  cosmetics industry grew up together with the marketing industry at the turn
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:24.640]  of the 20th century when we started to understand how the mind worked you know
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:27.840]  that we didn't really know about the unconscious until the late 19th century
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:31.720]  Sigmund Freud was the first guy who revolutionaries revolutionized brain
[01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:36.160]  and mind science because he said there's these unconscious drives there's these
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:42.240]  reasons why we do things that are based in our old with our upbringing how we
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:46.920]  were how we're brought up or the ideas that we formed as children and this was
[01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:50.360]  a revolutionary concept that marketers didn't take marketers very long to
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:53.400]  exploit within 20 or 30 or 40 years all of a sudden you just had the first
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:57.200]  advertising companies and the first public relations companies in fact Edward
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:01.680]  Bernays is known as the father of public relations and the first industries to
[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:06.040]  exploit these models were the food industry the drug industry and the
[01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:10.880]  cosmetics industry and they all grew up with head grew up based on heavy
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:15.800]  advertising and heavy marketing they got their funds initially from driving the
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:19.040]  message home that you got to eat this particular kind of food and you got to
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:23.080]  wear this particular kind of makeup and you got to use this particular drug if
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:25.240]  you're going to be healthy you're going to be young and you're going to be
[01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:30.080]  beautiful and to them we're now reaping the harvest of 120 years or even more
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:34.000]  of this kind of heavy heavy marketing and it especially takes place in these
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:37.400]  profit-intense businesses the pharmaceutical business the food
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:41.360]  business and the skincare cosmetics business you know look at the cycle to
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:46.200]  you just hit the nail on the head I mean the food industry makes you sick which
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:51.440]  then fuels the big pharma industry to sell you painkillers or other pharmaceutical
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:55.600]  interventions right now you know I remember going into a clinic and on a
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:49:00.040]  huge sign on the wall sure many of you have seen this big blue sign says you
[01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:04.200]  know in Texas and in the in the United States the number one cause of death is
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:07.760]  now painkillers and as a precautionary measure we're going to ask you a few
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:10.560]  questions if you're on them just to make sure you're okay you know we're not
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:13.600]  going to be a true intrusive in your life but we just want to make sure and
[01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:18.360]  you know I asked one of the doctors about it and they said oh yeah we can't
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:21.560]  hardly do anything about it because there are so many doctors that will just
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:26.040]  hand them out like candy many of them ultimately lose their licenses but we're
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:29.680]  talking about 12 plus million people that just take painkillers for fun well
[01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:32.920]  they tell you in the commercials ask your doctor about this you know you want
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:36.520]  they push you to push your doctor to give that to you because it's gonna make
[01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:40.040]  your life better in spite of the fact that they rattle off all these serious
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:45.000]  consequences in the commercial just ignore those they caught direct to
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.080]  consumer advertising DTC advertising and it really didn't get going until I
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:53.160]  believe it was one the late 1980s or the maybe the early 1990s and it was
[01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:56.160]  actually kind of a big scandal when it first started drug companies weren't
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:59.280]  crazy about it and doctors weren't crazy about it but as it turns out it became a
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:04.040]  big when it created a huge windfall for for the drug companies what ended up
[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:08.280]  happening is drugs became branded so people had their favorite drugs and
[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:12.120]  drugs became like happy meals and people would identify with certain brands of
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:17.240]  drugs this is this false choice of cereals and crackers and prescription
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:20.640]  drugs is something that we see all the time it when it comes to corporate
[01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:23.360]  pushed products they create a false choice why do you think you have so many
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:26.840]  different brands of cereal do you think they're all that different do we need a
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:29.520]  hundred different brands of cereal do we need a hundred different types of
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:33.480]  toothpaste do we need 20 different types of anti-depressants no this is a way
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:36.840]  that we create identity this is a way that
[01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:40.040]  we're gonna go to a commercial break we're talking to Anthony Gutiarty and
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:43.880]  Ben Fuchs of course Ben Fuchs's websites are brightsideben.com and

[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:05.680]  there on your computer I'm shopping for a new wallet mine is falling apart
[01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:09.940]  hey did you know there's a company called ID stronghold that makes shielded
[01:53:09.940 --> 01:53:13.120]  wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing oh I didn't realize there
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:17.000]  was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing what is that well apparently
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.880]  many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside
[01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:25.320]  them called RFID the transmitter banking information to card readers when we pay
[01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:29.640]  unfortunately a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city
[01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:33.240]  scanning people collecting their credit card numbers and personal information
[01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:37.680]  without us knowing it wow that sounds scary since you're getting a new wallet
[01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:41.200]  anyway you should definitely get an ID stronghold shielded wallet are they
[01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:45.160]  more expensive no in fact I can get a shielded leather wallet from ID
[01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:49.440]  stronghold.com for the same price or less than regular unshielded wallets from
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:53.760]  other stores sounds great my wallet isn't falling apart yet but let me pick
[01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:57.560]  one out too I want to be protected and these wallets ID stronghold.com look
[01:53:57.560 --> 01:54:13.960]  fantastic. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show we're talking to pharmacist Ben Fuchs and
[01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:20.120]  Anthony Gutierrez of Natural Society and of course a lot of us are amazed that
[01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:24.360]  California's assigned into law this bill that is going to essentially mandate
[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:29.000]  vaccinations ostracized children so they can't go to school if they don't get
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:33.040]  their vaccines on schedule that the pharmaceutical companies in the AMA have
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:37.400]  dictated to them but of course there's been things that have been mandated into
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:42.360]  our food supply dumped in without our consent things like fluoride that they
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:46.740]  just dump in massive amounts mass medicating the society through the
[01:54:46.740 --> 01:54:51.280]  water supply I mean how stupid is that even if it was something that I I didn't
[01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:56.880]  know was harmful to mass medicate the population by just dumping it in the
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:54:59.480]  water you can't control the dosage with that Anthony and you got an article that
[01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:02.800]  just came out about that as well. That's right so you know a lot of bad things
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:07.080]  have been happening with the TPP or a lot of a lot of bad things right but at
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:10.000]  the same time we're achieving a lot of victories with the World Health
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:13.360]  Organization saying that Monsanto's roundup which contains glyphosate is
[01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:17.200]  causing cancer and DDT and 240 as I spoke of earlier I had actually forgotten
[01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:20.520]  that I'd written this article late late last night when I saw it come out a new
[01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:24.960]  scientific review found there was zero evidence no evidence that water
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:28.880]  fluoridation actually prevents cavities in any way in any way they said
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:33.160]  topically as we do know there is some benefits because what fluoride does is
[01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:39.320]  it kills everything including you so this ties in to the Harvard study that
[01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:43.120]  came out in 2012 that we told you about in which the quote from the Harvard
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:47.160]  researchers said the children in high fluoride areas had significantly lower
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:51.240]  IQ than those who lived in low fluoride areas so these researchers were
[01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:54.880]  concerned by that and they said well is there really any benefit to it though
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:57.840]  and they looked at all the studies this was a meta-analysis so they looked at
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:00.800]  all the studies and they said well there was 73 different studies I believe the
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:05.400]  number was but all of them pretty much resulted in no evidence of helping
[01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:09.480]  prevent cavities in any way so this is groundbreaking and you know the government
[01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:14.920]  did just reduce fluoride levels in 2015 in June so this was very recent they
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:18.080]  reduced fluoride levels across the board most likely because they knew about the
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:21.560]  study coming out and also because Harvard study which took them three years
[01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:26.040]  but this is huge and this was in Newsweek this is where I found it but this
[01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:29.960]  isn't being picked up enough I mean this is major major news it has no
[01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:33.160]  evidence that's preventing cavities so why is it still in the water we've had
[01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:37.720]  the Harvard study that says that fluoride and high enough concentration reduces
[01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:41.720]  IQ we've had the British studies where they looked at epidemiological study
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:44.680]  where they looked at different areas where they fluoridated the water others
[01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:48.680]  where they didn't they noticed a big increase in ADHD of pharmacist Ben Fuchs
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:51.480]  what do you think about this because your pharmacist I mean how do you control
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:55.640]  the dosage of something even if it were safe and effective how do you control the
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:58.720]  dosage when you just dump it in the water supply you know you know when I was
[01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:02.840]  in you know in the pharmacy they have sodium fluoride 2.2 milligrams as a
[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:06.480]  prescription product and it's regulated and you take it in the control dose it's
[01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:10.880]  regulated as a legend drug the same fluoride that's in your water so yeah
[01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:13.840]  you're exactly right how do you control the dosage it's great Anthony that they
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:17.360]  lowered the the concentration but what about people are drinking a gallon a day
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:21.320]  or half a gallon a day how much fluoride are they getting not to mention the fact
[01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:25.440]  that fluoride is a brain drug and affects the brain who are the first people to
[01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:29.640]  use fluoride the Nazis and the Russians and when they were working on
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:34.440]  manipulating the brain of people in concentration camps and and in the
[01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:38.160]  gulag the same fluoride that we're feeding our babies and we're drinking
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:42.480]  ourselves you're absolutely correct fluoride is a cytotoxic element it
[01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:47.280]  kills cells that's all you need to know why would you take a substance that kills
[01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:51.120]  cells and put it in the water is there no better way to help strengthen people's
[01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:56.720]  teeth or our teeth so the divine force or nature or God make our teeth so weak
[01:57:56.720 --> 01:58:00.440]  that only a medical intervention like fluoride can help strengthen our teeth
[01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:04.440]  this is absurd on the face of it and you haven't even talked about chlorine a
[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:09.080]  chlorine you know it's chlorine the best way that we can detoxify our water what
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:13.800]  about ultraviolet detoxification what about ozonation of water what is what
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:17.040]  is fluoride and chlorine doing to probiotics and good bacteria in the gut
[01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:21.840]  so I personally I drink distilled water I don't want to go near fluoride and
[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:24.440]  chlorine if you are drinking a lot of fluorine chlorine that's all the more
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:27.720]  reason to get yourself on the bioluminescence and a good probiotic
[01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:30.360]  supplement make sure you're eating enough fiber and getting enough vegetable

[02:00:16.480 --> 02:00:25.540]  network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex
[02:00:25.540 --> 02:00:32.080]  Jones show I'm David Knight your host on this July 1st 2015 it's been an
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:35.520]  amazing day in terms of the news of course the story that we had came out
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:41.920]  last night late on info wars calm Obama removing the TPP's anti-slavery clause
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:49.080]  while he postures on opposing slavery 150 years ago but not today so much but
[02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:53.240]  of course you're not going to notice that because of all of the symbolism but
[02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:58.880]  even more amazing as I said before the it's not just the TPP but it's the PPD
[02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:07.440]  you got the TPP the TTIP the TPA on and on and on it's all there to confuse
[02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:11.880]  everybody you know what the public is massively confused that's why we're
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:15.480]  here we're trying to educate people that's why we need your help to
[02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:19.520]  understand what this is it's not that hard to understand just understand that
[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:23.360]  they're ramming this through on a fast track they're going to combine the U.S.
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:27.600]  with a Pacific trading block with an Atlantic trading block the European
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:32.440]  trading block that's part of a plan that's been out since the 1970s
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:36.840]  formulated that's the basis for the Trilateral Commission that does big new
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:42.240]  Brzezinski put out creating economic union so they can then create political
[02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:48.200]  union out of chaos so it's not just the secret directives that Obama has out
[02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:51.480]  there that's what these PPD's the presidential policy directives their
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:56.760]  executive orders on super secret steroids you know it's kind of like a
[02:01:56.760 --> 02:02:01.000]  member animal house where the fraternity house was put on super secret probation
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:05.360]  well I guess the entire country has been put on super secret probation because
[02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:08.800]  we're not allowed to know what these secret laws are but we have to obey
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:13.040]  them we're not allowed to know what the secret pronouncements of the secret
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:19.280]  FISA court are that supposedly secretly modify our Constitution but hey you know
[02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:24.200]  we don't have a stake in this we're not stakeholders the stakeholders of the
[02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:28.360]  lobbyists to set this all up just as we're talking to pharmacist Ben Fuchs
[02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:32.880]  in the last segment he was talking about how they have the food pyramid you
[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:35.880]  know that's not really a food pyramid Z point out it's really a pyramid of
[02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:41.120]  lobbyists and we know who is at the top of course there's also the issue that's
[02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:44.520]  going on with Greece it's constantly changing a state of flux there's going
[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:50.760]  to be a referendum on July 5th people are going to decide whether or not they
[02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:54.560]  want to accept the deal that's being handed to them by the IMF the World Bank
[02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:58.480]  the European Central Bank and others we're not they're going to buy into that
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:04.920]  I was talking before we went to our guest pharmacist Ben Fuchs and Anthony
[02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:09.600]  Gutiarty natural society I was talking about this interview that Alex Jones had
[02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:15.520]  with Greg Palast back in 2002 and it's in the book 9-11 descent into tyranny
[02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:18.960]  because it's very important to understand the mechanism that they use and
[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:24.480]  here we are 13 years later we see exactly how this is operating in the
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:28.840]  context of Greece in the context of these partnerships these transatlantic
[02:03:28.840 --> 02:03:32.920]  trans-Pacific partnerships as I was reading into this though it we had we'd
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:38.640]  talked about how they used the economy to implode countries how they even planned
[02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:43.960]  on the riots because the riots were going to be useful tools for them and
[02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:50.240]  then Alex Jones in this interview from 2002 then asked Greg Palast he said
[02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:54.840]  bro into NM Rothschild you'll find it all there go through these four points
[02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:58.240]  you've got the documents the IMF the World Bank implosion four points how
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:01.400]  they bring down a country how they destroy the resources of the people and
[02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:05.520]  Greg Palast says right well first you open the capital markets that is you
[02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:10.400]  sell off the local banks to foreign banks then you go to what's called market
[02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:13.640]  based pricing that's the stuff like in California where everything is free
[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:17.000]  market you end up with water bills we can't even imagine selling off water
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:20.440]  companies in the United States of America remember now this is 13 years ago
[02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:24.720]  we got this massive drought California we've got massive moves throughout the
[02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:29.120]  world now with big corporations trying to corner the market on water 13 years
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:32.120]  ago we're talking about this he says but imagine if a private company like
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:35.720]  Enron owned your water then the prices go through the roof then you open up the
[02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:40.200]  borders to trade complete free marketeering and Stiglitz who was a
[02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:43.200]  chief economist remember he was running the system he was their numbers man he
[02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:47.200]  was saying it was like the opium wars this isn't free trade it's coercion
[02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:52.160]  trade this is war they are taking economies apart stay with us we're
[02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:55.520]  gonna come back we're gonna take your calls in the next segment and we're
[02:04:55.520 --> 02:04:59.080]  gonna talk about a little bit more about real ID stay with us
[02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:04.160]  Hey Daniels Infowars.com I came across some statistics from a gun control group
[02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:09.120]  which state that 12,558 people were killed after being shot last year now
[02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:13.560]  let's assume that's true but let's also compare them to other statistics such
[02:05:13.560 --> 02:05:17.600]  as the fact that guns prevent an estimated 2.5 million crimes a year
[02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:23.000]  let's take 2.5 million and divide that by 12,558 what do we come up with
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:29.360]  199 in other words guns are used around 199 times more often to prevent crime
[02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:33.760]  than to kill even if we were to say double the number of people shot and

[02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:19.000]  network
[02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:26.600]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this Wednesday July 1st 2015 I'm David
[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:29.840]  Knight your host I'm gonna start taking your calls in this segment I'd like to
[02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:33.120]  get your feedback on what is happening in this country because things are
[02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:38.920]  changing fast and furious it does us does not make us feel any better to be
[02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:44.040]  so right about what's going on but we need to understand where this is headed
[02:08:44.040 --> 02:08:49.200]  and as you can see things moving down this path just as I was talking about in
[02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:52.680]  the last segment this this book and of course you can get it if you're a
[02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:57.360]  member of Prison Planet TV you can get the PDF of this 9-11 descent into
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:09:01.520]  tyranny in the back there was a section talking about how the banks were
[02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:05.120]  manipulating people we're seeing that happening right now we're seeing it
[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:09.720]  happening in Greece and just as I was pointing out in the last segment the
[02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:14.360]  same type of stuff that we're seeing happening with these trade partnerships
[02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:16.960]  that they call them they're really treaties they're just playing a game
[02:09:16.960 --> 02:09:21.960]  playing a semantic game not calling it a treaty so that they don't have to go
[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:25.560]  through the constitutional process of ratifying a treaty that would require
[02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:29.280]  67 votes in the Senate of course they have now passed the trade promotion
[02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:34.760]  authority the fast track bill which will mean that the bill is not going to have
[02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:38.720]  to go through the usual legislative process of getting approved and committee
[02:09:38.720 --> 02:09:43.320]  being recommended by the leadership no it will go to the floor to for a vote
[02:09:43.320 --> 02:09:49.440]  and no less than 45 days once they present this secret bill the secret
[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:53.160]  treaty that has been negotiated with the corporate lawyers for years once they
[02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:57.200]  present that it will automatically have to go to the door to the floor and no
[02:09:57.200 --> 02:10:03.960]  less than 45 days they will have no right to have a debate or discussion no
[02:10:03.960 --> 02:10:07.760]  amendments they will be able to debate it for 20 hours max there will be no
[02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:15.040]  amendments there will be no filibustering allowed and so this thing is
[02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:18.720]  going to be rammed through without the public having much time to take a look
[02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:23.600]  at it this is the way that both John Boehner and Nancy Pelosi have been
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:28.560]  operating now for the last several years bring in a gigantic omnibus bill
[02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:33.240]  present it to the people on the House and the Senate you don't give them any
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:37.120]  time to read it you say we got a vote on this the next day we can expect to see
[02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:41.520]  that sort of thing because you know we're not stakeholders so what difference
[02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:45.280]  does it matter whether or not our elected representatives have a chance to
[02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:49.720]  take a look at this or not we're gonna also talk about the the vaccination bill
[02:10:49.720 --> 02:10:55.200]  as well if you want to call in that number is 800 259 9231 again that
[02:10:55.200 --> 02:11:02.080]  number is 800 259 9231 how do we deal with this and of course
[02:11:02.080 --> 02:11:07.880]  pharmacist Ben Fuchs had had some good advice we take control of our lives to
[02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:12.760]  the degree that we can and you don't always ask permission just do it
[02:11:12.760 --> 02:11:16.480]  yourself and until they actually put a gun to your head till they take the food
[02:11:16.480 --> 02:11:18.840]  off the shelves there's a lot of things that we can still do there was
[02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:23.560]  interesting article on the Daily sheeple I was talking about one of the most
[02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:27.940]  important aspects of survival that's overlooked and undervalued and the
[02:11:27.940 --> 02:11:31.120]  author Paley Roberts is saying I find it absolutely fascinating when I meet new
[02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:34.360]  folks of like mine who offered to teach me numerous additional skills it would
[02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:38.360]  be beneficial in the bleak future that seems to be likely and talks about how
[02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:41.560]  yeah we can learn to do this we learn to do that but says here's one of the most
[02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:48.120]  effective things you can do to prepare and say get yourself healthy make sure
[02:11:48.120 --> 02:11:50.960]  that you're in as good a physical condition as possible you know what I
[02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:54.000]  was talking about the situation is going on in Greece remember there they're
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.920]  limiting people to how much money they can withdraw there's a pensioner there
[02:11:56.920 --> 02:12:02.360]  who can only get $130 a week out and he says you know that's that's not much
[02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:06.600]  for us to live on and I can't afford to buy any medication for my wife who's
[02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:12.800]  just had an operation so you don't want to go into an economic collapse like
[02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:16.720]  they're seeing in Greece in a situation if you can if you can help it you want
[02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:20.880]  to be in as good a physical condition as possible and they gave three different
[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:24.640]  things that you can do with the if it's going to hit the fan number one a
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:27.800]  person's body will already be at a disadvantage if things go right the
[02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:32.080]  ability to fight disease to run away from an enemy to defend oneself to survive
[02:12:32.080 --> 02:12:36.760]  nutrient shortages will be reduced if you're not healthy number two switching
[02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:40.600]  diets in time of an emergency can cause a body to go through a lot of
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:45.000]  unexpected trauma which can result in number one what we just talked about
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:49.040]  being at a disadvantage not being able to fight the disease and then of course
[02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:52.800]  number three there may not be a doctor around that would be able to offer a
[02:12:52.800 --> 02:12:58.000]  cholesterol reducing pill or a blood pressure pill or pain medication so the
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:03.040]  absence of doctors could be due to something as major as an economic
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:07.200]  collapse or as modest as a shortage of doctors hmm that could happen couldn't
[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:12.560]  it due to governmental mandates and the economies of government so what do you
[02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:15.840]  need to do you need to try to make sure you're as healthy as possible that's
[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:20.880]  why we sell the products that we do at info wars life calm we want to make
[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:24.720]  sure that you're as good a shape as possible we want to give you products
[02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:28.520]  that are going to help you as well as things that are going to fund the
[02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:33.880]  operation here we have a new product brain force as they say because there's a
[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:37.520]  war on your mind you know there's also a war on your health the average American
[02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:43.560]  now has a shorter attention span than even a goldfish if you were having
[02:13:43.560 --> 02:13:47.880]  brain force here that we're offering here to give you the nutrients to help
[02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:51.560]  you with brain health there's a highly advanced brain formula developed by our
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:55.320]  chemist to help fight back against the attacks on our cognitive function of
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:57.800]  course those can come from many different areas just as we're talking to
[02:13:57.800 --> 02:14:02.360]  pharmacist Ben in the last hour there's so many different things and the water
[02:14:02.360 --> 02:14:06.760]  that you drink the food that you eat the environment brain force is a good type
[02:14:06.760 --> 02:14:10.520]  of sustainable energy that Alex says puts his brain and overdrive you know
[02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:14.960]  I've noticed that from Alex I thought it was just when he came back I thought it
[02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:19.080]  was just the rest that he had been in but then it persisted and as I was
[02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:23.880]  telling Anthony I had a really hard time getting to sleep last night I
[02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:29.040]  basically went all night without having any sleep just tossing and turning the
[02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:32.400]  whole night for whatever reason I came in this morning I thought I'm gonna try
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:38.920]  that there was a bottle of brain force here so I took a couple of pills and it
[02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:43.360]  has really made a difference in the world for me today honestly try today see
[02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:47.840]  what it does for you visit info wars life calm that's info wars life calm I
[02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:52.120]  know it's going to sell out at least by this weekend because orders are building
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:57.400]  up I want to go to your calls and I want to talk to people we really haven't
[02:14:57.400 --> 02:15:01.680]  covered what's going on in California yet that much in detail and this is very
[02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:05.280]  important because it's something that's not just going to affect people in
[02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:10.760]  California this push to mandate vaccines was something that we saw
[02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:14.480]  happening all across the country you want to talk about something that is
[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:20.240]  suspicious you've got a very small minor outbreak of measles and they use this
[02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:25.080]  just like they use a shooting to try to further their agenda to create a crisis
[02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:29.680]  to try to further this nationally so we had bills that popped up all over the
[02:15:29.680 --> 02:15:34.440]  country all at once to take away our informed consent now they don't call it
[02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:38.680]  that they say they're going to remove your personal belief exemption because
[02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:45.160]  they play semantic games with the language in order to when say they take
[02:15:45.160 --> 02:15:49.080]  the high ground with what they call it you don't call it informing people you
[02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:53.200]  say oh you're not informed you just have a personal belief the experts they're
[02:15:53.200 --> 02:15:58.680]  informed you need to do what the experts say you're not capable of doing the
[02:15:58.680 --> 02:16:02.200]  research yourself you're not capable of making a decision so we don't need to
[02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:07.720]  inform you and then of course it's not consent because everything is mandated
[02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:15.880]  okay so we are just slaves who do what we are told and they might give us an
[02:16:15.880 --> 02:16:21.320]  exemption from those mandates or maybe not so they take informed consent and
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:24.240]  they turn it to that and as I pointed out you know informed consent has a lot
[02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:29.240]  of different sides to it it's one aspect if they take away your informed
[02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:33.600]  consent one aspect is they can force you to take medications they can force you
[02:16:33.600 --> 02:16:37.240]  to drink fluoride in your water not telling you not controlling the dosage
[02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:41.160]  because they're just mad at massively dumping it into the water we know why
[02:16:41.160 --> 02:16:45.200]  they're doing it they started doing it to get rid of the waste of the aluminum
[02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:50.520]  and then the nuclear industries they had a toxic substance they were gonna have
[02:16:50.520 --> 02:16:55.080]  to pay a lot of money to safely dispose of or they could create this fiction
[02:16:55.080 --> 02:17:00.640]  that fluoride is going to somehow help you with your health and then sell it
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:05.080]  instead of having to pay to dispose of it they could sell it to different
[02:17:05.080 --> 02:17:10.480]  municipalities and make a profit at the same time they force you to take it and
[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:14.120]  now that house of cards is starting to come down because we had study after
[02:17:14.120 --> 02:17:17.720]  study showing the effects as we just mentioned in the last hour showing the
[02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:23.200]  effects on IQ Harvard studies showing the effects of IQ in China as well as
[02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:29.240]  British studies showing the effects of fluoride in the water versus areas that
[02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:33.120]  did not have a fluoridation showing that there was a massive increase in ADHD
[02:17:33.120 --> 02:17:38.080]  because it affects the brain just as Ben Fuchs was telling us in the last hour
[02:17:38.080 --> 02:17:41.640]  and now the study that's come out says well you know we really can't tell that
[02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:47.640]  it does anything to help your tooth health you think I mean if it's gonna
[02:17:47.640 --> 02:17:50.240]  help your tooth health you would think that maybe you would apply it to your
[02:17:50.240 --> 02:17:55.160]  teeth and if it was a medication even if it was safe and effective you need to
[02:17:55.160 --> 02:17:59.880]  control the dosage of any medication but we are just their slaves we're just
[02:17:59.880 --> 02:18:03.600]  their subjects and nothing makes that more clear than this situation in
[02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:10.640]  California ramming down state bill 277 as I pointed out it's been shut down
[02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:14.200]  across the country and other places but California of course they get it through
[02:18:14.200 --> 02:18:17.520]  there now here's has going to affect all of us because there are people in
[02:18:17.520 --> 02:18:19.880]  California who are not going to bow down and do this they're going to
[02:18:19.880 --> 02:18:22.440]  challenge this they're going to challenge it in court it's going to wind
[02:18:22.440 --> 02:18:25.640]  its way through the courts I fully expect with the kind of courts that they
[02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:29.400]  have in California and with the ninth district court out there in California
[02:18:29.400 --> 02:18:34.240]  being pretty much adamantly opposed to any individual freedom or choice they're
[02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:38.480]  going to ram down a status decision it will wind its way to the Supreme Court
[02:18:38.480 --> 02:18:43.080]  and who knows how they will do how they will decide because they don't seem to
[02:18:43.080 --> 02:18:48.040]  rely on the law too much anymore I have to say when they say that they are
[02:18:48.040 --> 02:18:51.480]  going to force you to take vaccinations of course they have different ways that
[02:18:51.480 --> 02:18:55.440]  they play with this to say well we're not really forcing you you don't have to
[02:18:55.440 --> 02:18:59.400]  you don't have to get your kids vaccinated you just won't be able to put
[02:18:59.400 --> 02:19:04.320]  them in a school public or private they even included homeschooling there for a
[02:19:04.320 --> 02:19:07.000]  while but they figured well the homeschoolers going to fight us too hard
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:10.680]  on that so for the moment we'll give them an exemption we'll come after the
[02:19:10.680 --> 02:19:14.480]  homeschoolers later a lot of the homeschoolers saw through that they
[02:19:14.480 --> 02:19:19.440]  were very active in terms of fighting it but of course they don't really care and
[02:19:19.440 --> 02:19:22.560]  then what we see here in Texas this is an article that we have from Don Salazar
[02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:26.440]  yesterday Texas clinics are turning away unvaccinated children and of course
[02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:31.440]  this is one of the largest health care groups in the area here they have a half
[02:19:31.440 --> 02:19:36.040]  million people that they service and they're saying that they're not going
[02:19:36.040 --> 02:19:42.000]  to see your child if you don't want to get your vaccinations so you still have
[02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:46.240]  a choice you don't have to get it but they just won't provide any health care
[02:19:46.240 --> 02:19:50.520]  to you what do you think is going to happen when the government controls our
[02:19:50.520 --> 02:19:54.440]  health care when the government is telling us what to do and providing our

[02:24:17.920 --> 02:24:24.240]  2015 we're gonna go to your calls in just a moment and we're going to we've
[02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:29.240]  got several people in California I want to get their reaction on this new
[02:24:29.240 --> 02:24:33.160]  vaccine bill that's been put through that's going to take away people's
[02:24:33.160 --> 02:24:41.960]  informed consent you know we talked to the one of the founders of the National
[02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:45.920]  Vaccine Information Center she pointed out that if they're going to tag and
[02:24:45.920 --> 02:24:51.440]  track you if they are going to force you to inject into your body toxins of
[02:24:51.440 --> 02:24:56.400]  unknown effect if they can do that and of course it's not just the current
[02:24:56.400 --> 02:24:59.520]  vaccines that we have that they are mandating it's any vaccine that they
[02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:05.680]  come up with and they have every incentive to make these vaccines because
[02:25:05.680 --> 02:25:09.480]  they have no liability so every treatment that they're coming up with is
[02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:13.960]  taking the form of a vaccine because they have the vaccine court that you will
[02:25:13.960 --> 02:25:18.200]  go to if you were harmed by their product they have no incentive to do due
[02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:22.560]  diligence and they have no liability so the real immunity that anybody is
[02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:26.360]  getting out of this you're not getting the vaccines and we'll talk about that
[02:25:26.360 --> 02:25:31.520]  later in this hour we've we've shown study after study that shows that the
[02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:35.440]  vaccines are not providing the immunity the efficacy that they're telling you
[02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:40.560]  about it so you know putting it together in some kind of a herd immunity
[02:25:40.560 --> 02:25:46.360]  that's not happening but it's just going to continue to increase because
[02:25:46.360 --> 02:25:50.520]  they're going to the only people that have any real immunity are the
[02:25:50.520 --> 02:25:56.040]  corporations who are selling it to you and again we had this decision from the
[02:25:56.040 --> 02:26:00.920]  Supreme Court on asking for identification proof of citizenship for
[02:26:00.920 --> 02:26:04.120]  people are voting they say you can't do that as I pointed out in the first hour
[02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:10.320]  we've had three amendments that touched on voting because there's no specifics
[02:26:10.320 --> 02:26:13.760]  in the Constitution so they put some specifics in three amendments 50 years
[02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:18.960]  apart one in 1871 and 1920 another one in 1970 they all had the same basic form
[02:26:18.960 --> 02:26:23.160]  the right of citizens the United States to vote shall not be denied because of
[02:26:23.160 --> 02:26:33.000]  fill in the blank and it was things like race sex age now we come to 2015 45
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:37.160]  years after the last one of those and Supreme Court comes in and says no we're
[02:26:37.160 --> 02:26:41.000]  not going to allow you to determine if somebody is a citizen say voting is the
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:44.240]  right of a citizen but they're not going to let you determine who a citizen is
[02:26:44.240 --> 02:26:51.480]  nevertheless starting in 2016 January 2016 you will need to provide as a
[02:26:51.480 --> 02:26:57.440]  citizen real ID in order for you to get on an airplane the TSA is going to
[02:26:57.440 --> 02:27:02.840]  require that so you see anybody can come in and they can vote and we just take
[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:10.920]  their word for it but if you want to get on a plane as a citizen you better be
[02:27:10.920 --> 02:27:16.760]  ready to prove who you are and show your identity papers to the Nazis who are
[02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:24.400]  waiting to to mess with you to harass you to fondle you you know even the
[02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:29.160]  Nazis didn't do that in occupied France it's just absolutely absolutely insane
[02:27:29.160 --> 02:27:33.120]  what's wrong with real ID go to this site here this is a good place to go for
[02:27:33.120 --> 02:27:36.320]  information real nightmare.org they break it down what's wrong with real ID well
[02:27:36.320 --> 02:27:40.560]  they say it's real invasive it'll create America's first national identity card
[02:27:40.560 --> 02:27:43.880]  and again it's rolling out in 2016 they're going to use the hammer of course
[02:27:43.880 --> 02:27:47.880]  they're not going to require you to get that national ID card just like the
[02:27:47.880 --> 02:27:50.760]  vaccines you know if you want to go to school you got to get your vaccine if you
[02:27:50.760 --> 02:27:53.600]  want to get on a plane you got to get the national ID card but you know we're
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:59.120]  not forcing you are we right it's also gonna have real red tape gonna have
[02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:03.480]  a lot of bureaucracy led long lines they point out repeated trips higher fees
[02:28:03.480 --> 02:28:07.280]  for individuals trying to get licenses and IDs yeah I tell you what when I moved
[02:28:07.280 --> 02:28:11.040]  to Texas the process that I had to go through to get a driver's license was
[02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:16.480]  ridiculous all the different ways that I had to prove who I was real expensive
[02:28:16.480 --> 02:28:20.320]  of course it's gonna you know somebody's got to pay for all this vetting of people
[02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:24.760]  to make sure that they're citizens but not when they vote okay not when they vote
[02:28:24.760 --> 02:28:29.760]  we don't want to do any of that you won't have to show your real ID ever to
[02:28:29.760 --> 02:28:35.760]  vote okay as a point out it is real pointless it will do nothing to protect
[02:28:35.760 --> 02:28:41.320]  us against terrorism I want to go to your calls now let's go to let's go to mark
[02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:44.960]  in California you had you're in California they've just passed this

[02:30:03.720 --> 02:30:07.760]  than knowing the star-spangled banner it's knowing the Constitution it's
[02:30:07.760 --> 02:30:12.040]  understanding those rights and fighting for them our country's falling apart
[02:30:12.040 --> 02:30:16.000]  because people have forgotten to fight to stand up in the face of tyranny and
[02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:20.080]  do the right thing it's putting your life on the line to protect your country
[02:30:20.080 --> 02:30:24.240]  from enemies both foreign and domestic the Bill of Rights is what the people
[02:30:24.240 --> 02:30:29.200]  are entitled to against every government and no government should refuse or rest
[02:30:29.200 --> 02:30:34.240]  on inference so the Tree of Liberty must be refreshed from time to time with a
[02:30:34.240 --> 02:30:39.200]  blood of patriots and tyrants I'm Joe Biggs with info wars calm and I believe
[02:30:39.200 --> 02:30:43.880]  our flag is more than cloth and ink it is a symbol that stands for liberty and
[02:30:43.880 --> 02:30:48.160]  freedom it is a history of our nation and it's marked by the blood of those who
[02:30:48.160 --> 02:30:53.080]  died defending it so join me in this info war turn off your TV put your

[02:33:33.400 --> 02:33:37.720]  executive orders except their secret you're not allowed even Congress is not
[02:33:37.720 --> 02:33:42.800]  allowed to know what the subjects are they're not amazing as Senator Sessions
[02:33:42.800 --> 02:33:48.560]  would say it's breathtaking every day we have another breathtaking revelation of
[02:33:48.560 --> 02:33:52.480]  a lawless out of control government they've been putting their hands on our
[02:33:52.480 --> 02:33:57.280]  kids at the airport now they're going to put their drugs into our kids without
[02:33:57.280 --> 02:34:01.840]  our permission it's just absolutely amazing to me what is happening I want
[02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:04.400]  to go to your calls get your reactions we've got several people on the line
[02:34:04.400 --> 02:34:09.360]  calling in from California because we've just now seen the the government
[02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:13.600]  state government there remove people's informed consent as far as vaccines go
[02:34:13.600 --> 02:34:21.600]  let's go back to Jeff in California Jeff go ahead Mark oh okay let's go to Mark
[02:34:21.600 --> 02:34:47.360]  go ahead Mark yes yeah you know as Paul put it in the last day's perilous times she'll come and I've got 10 kids and my seventh just graduated from high school we still have three from 11 to 16 and my oh my you know I pray about this I really do and I when I heard Alex Jones interview
[02:34:47.360 --> 02:34:53.280]  Dr. Thompson it just like it hit me between the eyes I mean here's a guy that says he
[02:34:53.280 --> 02:34:57.440]  knew it gave autism okay and you shut up about it and now he's not shutting up
[02:34:57.440 --> 02:35:03.000]  about it I mean this is the high-ranking CDC doctor you know how can you how can
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:08.160]  you reject testimony like that from a guy like that and it's all about money
[02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:13.880]  that's what it is there's no logic in it and so we're gonna we're just gonna so
[02:35:13.880 --> 02:35:18.320]  far our school more and more people are listening to Alex Jones and and more and
[02:35:18.320 --> 02:35:22.360]  more just getting educated without listening to Alex Jones that there's
[02:35:22.360 --> 02:35:26.840]  such a huge amount of people out here in California that are waking up to it our
[02:35:26.840 --> 02:35:35.200]  school in San Jose you know quickly you know got us you know word got around that
[02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:41.000]  you know the sign sign the exemption so still there is a an exemption so far you
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:44.840]  know that a lot of people believe it's going to make it so you you don't have
[02:35:44.840 --> 02:35:48.760]  to get them back vaccinated but if it comes down to it we're gonna pull our
[02:35:48.760 --> 02:35:54.440]  kids out they're not going to vaccinate my kids I don't have any guns yet but if
[02:35:54.440 --> 02:35:58.040]  I have to die I don't want to kill anyone but they're not gonna back to make my
[02:35:58.040 --> 02:36:02.040]  kids you know I have to defend my kids absolutely I mean this is just the
[02:36:02.040 --> 02:36:06.640]  worst kind of tyranny I'm good for you and good for you for having ten kids I
[02:36:06.640 --> 02:36:10.040]  know you would tell people that it's a blessing to have kids and not a burden
[02:36:10.040 --> 02:36:14.480]  wouldn't you they're they're both they're a great blessing and they're
[02:36:14.480 --> 02:36:18.600]  burdened that God says be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth you
[02:36:18.600 --> 02:36:22.160]  know and they are blessing this is what the Lord said that's right trust in God
[02:36:22.160 --> 02:36:26.800]  and it's weird you know we have to look at think about this in the context of
[02:36:26.800 --> 02:36:31.160]  this recent decision here in California now we were told that you know children
[02:36:31.160 --> 02:36:35.040]  were nothing but a burden there were we could not afford to have kids so we need
[02:36:35.040 --> 02:36:40.280]  to abort them the Supreme Court this wonderful Supreme Court these these ring
[02:36:40.280 --> 02:36:44.280]  race that we have up there they said you know it's you have a right to privacy
[02:36:44.280 --> 02:36:48.880]  people who support this said we're pro-choice isn't it interesting that
[02:36:48.880 --> 02:36:55.040]  the people who are saying that they were pro-choice on a woman's right to end her
[02:36:55.040 --> 02:37:01.440]  child's life they're not pro-choice on a parental appearance decision as to what
[02:37:01.440 --> 02:37:07.840]  medical procedures are going to have done okay that's the lie of these ring
[02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:13.520]  race the idea that there is some right to privacy how hollow how hollow can the
[02:37:13.520 --> 02:37:17.320]  right of privacy be look at all the revelations that we've had about our
[02:37:17.320 --> 02:37:22.440]  government being so incredibly paranoid conspiracy minded that they follow
[02:37:22.440 --> 02:37:26.120]  everything that we do everywhere they're mapping it all together mapping out our
[02:37:26.120 --> 02:37:29.920]  relationships following us everywhere they want to talk about a right to
[02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:35.640]  privacy only when it has to do with population control only when it has to
[02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:39.920]  do with eugenics that's when they will tell you the lie that they are pro-choice
[02:37:39.920 --> 02:37:44.080]  that they believe that you have a right to privacy they don't think you have any
[02:37:44.080 --> 02:37:48.120]  rights you are their slave they can put their hands on their your kids whenever
[02:37:48.120 --> 02:37:51.680]  they feel like it put their hands on you they can inject into you and your kids
[02:37:51.680 --> 02:37:55.480]  whatever they wish at any time is what they're saying and I agree with you I
[02:37:55.480 --> 02:37:59.360]  think we need is this is getting to the point where we're going to have to push
[02:37:59.360 --> 02:38:02.840]  back with everything that we've got and say hey ultimately you have to
[02:38:02.840 --> 02:38:05.800]  understand we have the second amendment if you're going to force inject us with
[02:38:05.800 --> 02:38:09.880]  mercury or other toxins we will force inject you with lead I mean that's
[02:38:09.880 --> 02:38:12.720]  basically where it's gonna have to come down thank you so much Mark you know
[02:38:12.720 --> 02:38:16.480]  you're not the only one who is talking about this we had Jim Carrey get on
[02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:21.000]  Twitter and he was very angry about this he says Jerry Brown is a corporate
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:28.080]  fascist who must be stopped absolutely and he is recommending people take a look
[02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:33.920]  at a back at a a documentary called trace amounts and you can find that at
[02:38:33.920 --> 02:38:36.720]  trace amounts dot com I read a couple of tweets from Jim Carrey because he had
[02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:40.560]  some really good tweets I retweeted him on on my personal account Jim Carrey
[02:38:40.560 --> 02:38:44.120]  says go to trace amounts dot com watch the documentary judge for yourself if
[02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:49.160]  you really care about the kids you will it is shocking another tweet from Jim
[02:38:49.160 --> 02:38:53.520]  Carrey said the CDC can't solve a problem they help to start yeah there's a
[02:38:53.520 --> 02:38:56.760]  conflict of interest there he says it's too risky to admit that they've been
[02:38:56.760 --> 02:39:02.480]  wrong about mercury and thymirasol they are corrupt this is corporate fascism
[02:39:02.480 --> 02:39:07.640]  this is the corporations working with the government to not just drive their
[02:39:07.640 --> 02:39:12.120]  competitors out of business now but go to the end user hold a gun to your head
[02:39:12.120 --> 02:39:18.400]  and force you force you to take their product let's go to Jeff in California
[02:39:18.400 --> 02:39:23.720]  Jeff you want to talk about vaccines hi Davis you're an absolute asset to the
[02:39:23.720 --> 02:39:29.200]  info or thank you for taking my call thank you my my nephew is vaccine
[02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:33.320]  entered he's almost four years old and when he got that round of shots before
[02:39:33.320 --> 02:39:38.320]  he was one we my sister and I saw the light go out in his eyes like what you
[02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:41.480]  guys talk about all the people that have called us talked about I physically
[02:39:41.480 --> 02:39:45.600]  watched this happen so when somebody passes something like this in my state
[02:39:45.600 --> 02:39:53.440]  man I I'm just screaming inside my skin man I can't describe you how angry I am
[02:39:53.440 --> 02:39:59.200]  this is like that here in California David you guys talk a lot about chem
[02:39:59.200 --> 02:40:05.080]  trails you know geoengineering I'm a truck driver I'm outside every day I've
[02:40:05.080 --> 02:40:09.040]  been watching it watching it for years now and it's real cloudy it's supposed
[02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:13.840]  to be raining and every time you'll see it get rainy it'll start raining for a
[02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:17.200]  little bit in the cloud split you'll see in between the split you'll see the
[02:40:17.200 --> 02:40:21.200]  chemtrails and all of a sudden I'll tell people around me mark my words it's
[02:40:21.200 --> 02:40:26.000]  going to get hot and dry within a day and it does every time right now it's
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:29.280]  real humid it's real cloudy they're chemtrailin above it it was chemtrailin
[02:40:29.280 --> 02:40:33.920]  like crazy yesterday they'll be hot and dry in a day I bet yes you know there
[02:40:33.920 --> 02:40:37.600]  was a I remember when we did the the Paul Revere contest somebody had a
[02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:41.600]  documentary and they also put up an app I think it was called skiter alert and
[02:40:41.600 --> 02:40:45.640]  what they would do is kind of crowdsourcing the the data collection
[02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:50.800]  and they they had people report on this app you can get on your device report
[02:40:50.800 --> 02:40:54.200]  when you see massive chemtrailing in other words you see like a criss-crossing
[02:40:54.200 --> 02:40:58.880]  grid of what looks like contrails except they're persistent and they
[02:40:58.880 --> 02:41:02.800]  gradually spread out and they hang there and they create a large cloud over it
[02:41:02.800 --> 02:41:07.600]  and what they noticed was as people reporting the areas where there was
[02:41:07.600 --> 02:41:10.920]  massive where they would see chemtrails and take pictures of it they would
[02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:15.320]  report it and then they would market with geo locators and they would they
[02:41:15.320 --> 02:41:19.600]  correlated it to temperature increases just as you're talking about I think
[02:41:19.600 --> 02:41:22.720]  it's that's quite fascinating yeah there's there's a lot of stuff that's
[02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:27.240]  going on fundamentally they don't care whether or not we agree with what they're
[02:41:27.240 --> 02:41:33.320]  doing let me ask you you said you're you had a relative nephew or niece that
[02:41:33.320 --> 02:41:38.160]  that was affected with a vaccine what was the problem that that happened post
[02:41:38.160 --> 02:41:44.680]  vaccine post vaccine is like I said the light in his eyes you know that life
[02:41:44.680 --> 02:41:47.320]  light that you can you know when you look at a baby go wow this one's gonna be
[02:41:47.320 --> 02:41:51.000]  a smart one he it went blank you know you're calling his name is named Brayden
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.400]  you're going hey Brayden Brayden Brayden he's looking off in the distance
[02:41:53.400 --> 02:41:57.480]  drooling on himself he's almost four now he's been in speech therapy since he was
[02:41:57.480 --> 02:42:01.880]  17 months old he'll point at stuff and say hey that's a cat a dog but other than
[02:42:01.880 --> 02:42:07.600]  that he's speaking his own language that is and it's basically the testimonies
[02:42:07.600 --> 02:42:11.800]  that you have many people come on your show and talk about and I physically
[02:42:11.800 --> 02:42:16.000]  watched this happen with my nephew and and like how could people be blind to
[02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:19.760]  this or even argue and especially the point you just made when you said I
[02:42:19.760 --> 02:42:22.520]  tell this to people all the time hey you're pro-choice you want to murder your
[02:42:22.520 --> 02:42:26.720]  baby but you what you think that you know you shouldn't have a choice or
[02:42:26.720 --> 02:42:29.520]  parents shouldn't have a choice about injecting your kids with whatever the
[02:42:29.520 --> 02:42:34.080]  government feels like injecting them with yes you know what I forgot how
[02:42:34.080 --> 02:42:38.960]  many times more vaccines that people have passed like 1993 versus you know say
[02:42:38.960 --> 02:42:43.920]  you know everybody before 1993 had you know there's a lot of different there's
[02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:47.440]  a lot of different symptoms that the parents have noticed and again we had
[02:42:47.440 --> 02:42:51.360]  Michelle Roten with nurses against mandatory vaccines I had her on to
[02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:54.600]  talk about how they're coercing people through the workplace through their
[02:42:54.600 --> 02:42:57.640]  jobs they're coercing people by saying we're not going to give you health care
[02:42:57.640 --> 02:43:01.600]  they're coercing people by saying you can't go to school if you don't get
[02:43:01.600 --> 02:43:04.200]  vaccinated then they say yeah you know we're still giving you your choice you
[02:43:04.200 --> 02:43:07.800]  still have it you can still choose about that but you know there's a lot of
[02:43:07.800 --> 02:43:12.680]  different ways that we see people react to this and here in Texas you know we
[02:43:12.680 --> 02:43:15.800]  talk about informed consent it's not only being forced to take things that you
[02:43:15.800 --> 02:43:21.600]  don't want to take against your consent it is also having things removed from you
[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:25.160]  that you want to take that you want to try natural remedies things like medical
[02:43:25.160 --> 02:43:29.400]  marijuana and these two come together in a very interesting way because we've
[02:43:29.400 --> 02:43:34.640]  had a lot of people talking about how as a result of being vaccinated
[02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:39.360]  immediately their child started having epileptic seizures uncontrollable
[02:43:39.360 --> 02:43:43.880]  seizures and there was testimony very moving testimony of a lawyer in
[02:43:43.880 --> 02:43:47.960]  California during these hearings who was talking about how that had happened to
[02:43:47.960 --> 02:43:54.360]  his child he was testifying for basically just fundamental rights to be able
[02:43:54.360 --> 02:43:57.480]  to make that choice for yourself but he was talking about how that had happened
[02:43:57.480 --> 02:44:02.440]  to his son we had David Simpson here in Texas a representative who was trying
[02:44:02.440 --> 02:44:06.160]  to reform the marijuana laws here in Texas and one of the things that
[02:44:06.160 --> 02:44:12.960]  motivated him was he had several people in his jurisdiction who had had adverse
[02:44:12.960 --> 02:44:16.800]  reactions to vaccines or children had had adverse reactions they had this
[02:44:16.800 --> 02:44:20.880]  ongoing continuous and it can be life-threatening it can take your life
[02:44:20.880 --> 02:44:26.200]  these multiple seizures and the only thing that would help was for them to
[02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:31.120]  get marijuana oil cannabis oil and they had to go to Colorado one of the
[02:44:31.120 --> 02:44:34.080]  couples didn't have the money that they could do that here's a story out of
[02:44:34.080 --> 02:44:38.360]  Morseville we've talked about this before a Morseville couple this is
[02:44:38.360 --> 02:44:44.720]  Morseville North Carolina their their child was injured and had exactly the
[02:44:44.720 --> 02:44:48.520]  same symptoms and of course they had to go to the vaccine court they were able
[02:44:48.520 --> 02:44:53.960]  to get some money out of this but it is completely destroyed not only the child's
[02:44:53.960 --> 02:44:59.680]  life but their life to take care of this child and the money that is given by the
[02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:05.120]  vaccine courts that is not a sufficient compensation it is not a real litigation
[02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:09.520]  as to what happens but I find it amazing to see over and over again these
[02:45:09.520 --> 02:45:14.080]  stories about children who have an adverse reaction to the vaccines who
[02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:19.240]  start to have these multiple seizures and the only thing that stops it is
[02:45:19.240 --> 02:45:22.760]  cannabis oil there was just another story about it in New Zealand they
[02:45:22.760 --> 02:45:28.360]  imported the cannabis oil from America for this child and it stopped it they
[02:45:28.360 --> 02:45:32.920]  just changed the law here in Texas the first exemption for medical marijuana
[02:45:32.920 --> 02:45:38.680]  was for this very condition they have now admitted in Texas that there is a
[02:45:38.680 --> 02:45:41.920]  medical use for marijuana which says then that it should no longer be
[02:45:41.920 --> 02:45:46.000]  classified as a schedule one drug meaning that it has no medical use that
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:50.800]  was the UN that came up with these drug schedules schedules one through four the
[02:45:50.800 --> 02:45:55.640]  UN created that ten years before Richard Nixon declared a war on drugs and put
[02:45:55.640 --> 02:46:02.320]  those out there it is a UN agenda just like UN agenda 21 these are agendas that
[02:46:02.320 --> 02:46:06.640]  the UN creates they get the local governments to enact them that's the
[02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:10.480]  way they control this the conservatives need to understand this war on drugs is
[02:46:10.480 --> 02:46:18.320]  not only destroying our legal framework it is also a UN agenda and they need to
[02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:24.800]  understand too that in many cases it is the only antidote to the harm that is
[02:46:24.800 --> 02:46:29.000]  done by these mandated vaccines let's go to Jerry in Texas I want to get some
[02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.720]  more calls sorry I didn't mean to talk so long Jerry in Texas you want to talk
[02:46:31.720 --> 02:46:37.520]  about vaccines go ahead yes sir I'm in Texas I got a two-year-old boy by the
[02:46:37.520 --> 02:46:42.080]  way mr. Knight that's just like to say out what an honor this talk to you well
[02:46:42.080 --> 02:46:45.160]  thank you for calling thank you for listening yeah right now that the
[02:46:45.160 --> 02:46:49.920]  earphones on and I hope people listen you know we we want to try to increase
[02:46:49.920 --> 02:46:52.840]  awareness in the different ways that we have the different mediums that we have
[02:46:52.840 --> 02:46:58.600]  and one is you know through social the social networking and it's a little bit
[02:46:58.600 --> 02:47:02.280]  shady over sketchy with things to bring up sometimes you know religion
[02:47:02.280 --> 02:47:06.800]  government vaccination stuff like that but as a new parent we've actually me
[02:47:06.800 --> 02:47:11.400]  and my wife has actually come in contact with some some doctors we thought
[02:47:11.400 --> 02:47:15.440]  were you know a lot more understanding here and we didn't want to get him you
[02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:19.880]  know she went for his two-year checkup and they ran us through hoops they sent
[02:47:19.880 --> 02:47:24.520]  three different doctors in to sit down and have consultations with us as to
[02:47:24.520 --> 02:47:29.600]  why we needed to get our kid vaccinated and arguably he's the cutest smartest
[02:47:29.600 --> 02:47:34.200]  kid you've ever seen and we imagine that as I've heard the last the last caller
[02:47:34.200 --> 02:47:36.680]  mentioned and we see it on you know we watch the documentaries and stuff
[02:47:36.680 --> 02:47:41.160]  imagine what it would be like if if this smart kid that everybody you know he
[02:47:41.160 --> 02:47:45.320]  had a lexicon of you know vocabulary of over a hundred words when he was just
[02:47:45.320 --> 02:47:51.560]  months old maybe maybe 12 14 months old really smart kid and what they're
[02:47:51.560 --> 02:47:55.600]  asking us to do potentially if it comes to Texas and it's too bad for
[02:47:55.600 --> 02:48:01.800]  California is to ask us to weigh out the risk versus reward the risk being hey
[02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:06.360]  if you don't get vaccinated there's these risks that you could get sick these
[02:48:06.360 --> 02:48:11.360]  terrible diseases but what are those risks I'm 35 years old smallpox polio
[02:48:11.360 --> 02:48:16.720]  needles I've never met anybody who had any of that 35 years times 360 days and
[02:48:16.720 --> 02:48:21.000]  so they want you to weigh this I will you know they try to scare you into it
[02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.920]  and we're sitting there at the doctor's office and I said you know what how
[02:48:23.920 --> 02:48:27.880]  about we can we can get some literature about the risks and the benefits of the
[02:48:27.880 --> 02:48:32.720]  vaccinations and they give you this stack of pamphlets that has cartoons
[02:48:32.720 --> 02:48:38.680]  drawn on it with it's a sales pitch and I'm a salesman I'm a pretty good one
[02:48:38.680 --> 02:48:44.680]  too I came back and I said hey you know can we get some of the actual inserts
[02:48:44.680 --> 02:48:51.400]  from the vaccine themselves declaring what these risks are in instead of your
[02:48:51.400 --> 02:48:57.240]  brochures your sales brochures yeah and apparently they put the insult to that
[02:48:57.240 --> 02:49:02.320]  and we were just really baffled that in today you especially here in Austin
[02:49:02.320 --> 02:49:09.520]  Texas where there's a lot of very aware people oh yeah you have to educate
[02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:12.800]  yourself because there's a tremendous pushback you know there's a tremendous
[02:49:12.800 --> 02:49:16.120]  pushback from the media because they make so much money 75 percent of the
[02:49:16.120 --> 02:49:21.040]  money that runs Fox News and MSNBC and all these major corporations is coming
[02:49:21.040 --> 02:49:26.320]  from the pharmaceutical companies Rupert Murdoch has connections to the
[02:49:26.320 --> 02:49:31.080]  pharmaceutical companies his son has has pharmaceutical connections to these but
[02:49:31.080 --> 02:49:34.320]  even if they didn't I mean they're making so much of their revenue from
[02:49:34.320 --> 02:49:39.000]  pushing these commercials but you mentioned talking about what are the
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.960]  consequences of getting some of these childhood diseases look I'm old enough
[02:49:41.960 --> 02:49:46.360]  I'm older than you I've had most of these childhood diseases which means I have a
[02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:51.080]  real immunity to it I don't have some phony thing that makes me think that I'm
[02:49:51.080 --> 02:49:55.720]  immune to it now I have real immunity because I really did have measles here's
[02:49:55.720 --> 02:50:01.720]  an article from February this year over 100 measles vaccine deaths and zero
[02:50:01.720 --> 02:50:06.520]  measles deaths since 2004 this is from New American you see what they don't
[02:50:06.520 --> 02:50:13.480]  tell you Jerry is that there's a risk with the vaccine just like there's a
[02:50:13.480 --> 02:50:17.640]  risk with measles you know some people are going to have an adverse if they're
[02:50:17.640 --> 02:50:22.600]  gonna have a very serious side effects with measles not very many it's very
[02:50:22.600 --> 02:50:26.480]  small number but there also people are gonna have adverse reactions to the
[02:50:26.480 --> 02:50:31.240]  vaccines problem is we can't tell if you're going to be in group a or you're
[02:50:31.240 --> 02:50:35.240]  gonna be in group B we really don't know which group you're going to be in so
[02:50:35.240 --> 02:50:40.800]  you have to take and make a decision and ask yourself what you feel the risks
[02:50:40.800 --> 02:50:45.480]  are understand what is truly involved in this and understand what the real
[02:50:45.480 --> 02:50:49.120]  statistics say that there's been a hundred measles deaths but no a hundred
[02:50:49.120 --> 02:50:53.040]  vaccine deaths but none from measles in the last 11 years stay with us we're
[02:50:53.040 --> 02:50:56.320]  going to be back with more of your calls
[02:50:58.760 --> 02:51:03.280]  honey it's time for dinner what are you doing over there on your computer I'm
[02:51:03.280 --> 02:51:07.560]  shopping for a new wallet mine is falling apart hey did you know there's a
[02:51:07.560 --> 02:51:11.480]  company called ID stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic
[02:51:11.480 --> 02:51:14.800]  pickpocketing I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pick
[02:51:14.800 --> 02:51:18.960]  pocketing what is that well apparently many of the new credit and debit cards
[02:51:18.960 --> 02:51:23.720]  being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID the transmitter banking
[02:51:23.720 --> 02:51:28.160]  information to card readers when we pay unfortunately a bad guy can also get one
[02:51:28.160 --> 02:51:31.600]  of these readers and go around the city scanning people collecting their credit
[02:51:31.600 --> 02:51:35.800]  card numbers and personal information without us knowing it wow that sounds
[02:51:35.800 --> 02:51:39.680]  scary since you're getting a new wallet anyway you should definitely get an ID
[02:51:39.680 --> 02:51:43.840]  stronghold shielded wallet are they more expensive no in fact I can get a
[02:51:43.840 --> 02:51:47.520]  shielded leather wallet from ID stronghold dot com for the same price or
[02:51:47.520 --> 02:51:52.160]  less than regular unshielded wallets from other stores sounds great my wallet

[02:55:25.560 --> 02:55:31.720]  hear so much about herd immunity and of course for herd immunity to be effective
[02:55:31.720 --> 02:55:36.600]  it has to be somewhat effective for each of the individuals doesn't it but you
[02:55:36.600 --> 02:55:40.920]  know herd immunity is not really working out too well we had an article back in
[02:55:40.920 --> 02:55:45.480]  February when they were still pushing these different initiatives of various
[02:55:45.480 --> 02:55:50.360]  states measles among vaccinate vaccinated Quebec kids were questioned 52 out of
[02:55:50.360 --> 02:55:54.800]  98 teens who caught measles had been fully vaccinated here's another one this
[02:55:54.800 --> 02:56:00.800]  is from March 26th students contract whooping cough at a school with a 99.5
[02:56:00.800 --> 02:56:04.720]  percent vaccination rate health authorities continue however to recommend
[02:56:04.720 --> 02:56:08.720]  the D tap vaccines despite their apparent inefficiency then there was this
[02:56:08.720 --> 02:56:13.680]  story it was in the New England Journal of Medicine and it was summarized as
[02:56:13.680 --> 02:56:19.880]  well and IFL science this was about measles Mary this is a measles outbreak
[02:56:19.880 --> 02:56:24.840]  that involved four people in New York City back in 2011 they wrote a paper
[02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:30.720]  about it in the New England Journal of Medicine that just came out at the end of
[02:56:30.720 --> 02:56:35.400]  last year in this particular case it was a 22 year old who had been twice
[02:56:35.400 --> 02:56:42.080]  vaccinated this individual then came down with measles and shed it to other
[02:56:42.080 --> 02:56:47.840]  people who had also been vaccinated two of them twice vaccinated the other two
[02:56:47.840 --> 02:56:50.960]  they weren't sure how many times they had been vaccinated but they did have the
[02:56:50.960 --> 02:56:55.120]  antibodies and I just want to finish up with this story this comes out of NPR
[02:56:55.120 --> 02:57:00.040]  and this is the story a father of a young leukemia survivor reacts to the new
[02:57:00.040 --> 02:57:04.480]  vaccine law and of course NPR is telling you isn't this wonderful now my child
[02:57:04.480 --> 02:57:08.000]  can go back my child who has a compromised immune system because he has
[02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:11.880]  leukemia my young child can now go back into public school because we're going
[02:57:11.880 --> 02:57:18.960]  to force everybody to have vaccines so combine these this information I just
[02:57:18.960 --> 02:57:23.840]  gave you about the fact that this outbreak of measles that happened in
[02:57:23.840 --> 02:57:30.800]  New York was a person the patient zero had been vaccinated twice and shed it to
[02:57:30.800 --> 02:57:35.640]  other people that's the other issue do you really want your child with a
[02:57:35.640 --> 02:57:39.560]  compromised immune system there because they can catch it from people who are
[02:57:39.560 --> 02:57:43.480]  shedding it besides the fact that when 99 and a half percent of the people get
[02:57:43.480 --> 02:57:47.960]  vaccinated with the hooping cough vaccine it's still not effective let's go
[02:57:47.960 --> 02:57:53.240]  to your calls Gabriel in California Gabriel yes David yeah I'm in California
[02:57:53.240 --> 02:57:56.600]  and one thing bothering me a lot is that forced vaccination because I got a
[02:57:56.600 --> 02:58:00.840]  four-year-old that's just about a start school and now I was told that she can't
[02:58:00.840 --> 02:58:04.480]  come in because and it's a private school yeah so what I did yesterday was not
[02:58:04.480 --> 02:58:09.320]  too private isn't it exactly so what I did was I went and placed a lawsuit for
[02:58:09.320 --> 02:58:15.080]  denying it and right away instantly they said well you can't do that yet because
[02:58:15.080 --> 02:58:18.920]  school hasn't started so it's technically not denied yet oh you don't
[02:58:18.920 --> 02:58:24.280]  have standing right you're not a stakeholder joke and so now but you know
[02:58:24.280 --> 02:58:27.280]  what I want to encourage everybody you know what good once everybody just
[02:58:27.280 --> 02:58:31.000]  start placing lawsuits on the school yes then it's gonna start waking everybody
[02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:34.440]  up a little bit saying hey look hey we can't handle this this is what we're

[03:00:15.520 --> 03:00:18.480]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host we're going in
[03:00:18.480 --> 03:00:22.000]  to overdrive because I want to continue with these colors that have been on hold
[03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:25.600]  I want to go back to Gabriel in California Gabriel you had another point
[03:00:25.600 --> 03:00:28.960]  to make you're going to fight this in court you said but they would not let
[03:00:28.960 --> 03:00:34.480]  you file suit yet because school hasn't started so go ahead tell us what I mean I
[03:00:34.480 --> 03:00:38.800]  just really want everybody to do exactly what I'm trying to do you know get
[03:00:38.800 --> 03:00:41.840]  everybody involved by doing because that's when everybody hears everything
[03:00:41.840 --> 03:00:46.840]  and listens you know yes absolutely yeah I just really want that to happen and
[03:00:46.840 --> 03:00:50.680]  I hope it does because we're I'm fighting this because other than that I'm a
[03:00:50.680 --> 03:00:55.560]  business owner in the Central Valley so it's like I do I really got to get a
[03:00:55.560 --> 03:00:59.000]  bit up and move because of this bill I will not do it yeah but I'm going to do
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:02.840]  everything I can to fight it you know and then it's a shame and if we don't
[03:01:02.840 --> 03:01:05.400]  fight it and people have been fighting it and all these other states if we don't
[03:01:05.400 --> 03:01:08.680]  fight it they're going to impose this nationally and of course we're going to
[03:01:08.680 --> 03:01:13.040]  see a lot of this type of stuff be imposed on us through this mandatory
[03:01:13.040 --> 03:01:16.120]  insurance through mandatory health care because that's the whole point the
[03:01:16.120 --> 03:01:20.800]  insurance is just a gradual takeover of the health system we all know that we
[03:01:20.800 --> 03:01:23.760]  will be going to the federal government to get our health care and they will
[03:01:23.760 --> 03:01:28.440]  hold things like this over our head just as we've seen here in Austin we see one
[03:01:28.440 --> 03:01:31.280]  of the largest health providers that serves over half a million people saying
[03:01:31.280 --> 03:01:34.880]  you're not going to get any health care from us if you don't take the vaccine
[03:01:34.880 --> 03:01:37.520]  thank you Gabriel I want to run on to some of the other people have been on
[03:01:37.520 --> 03:01:40.680]  hold for a while let's go to Kevin in Florida you want to talk about Google
[03:01:40.680 --> 03:01:46.040]  Call cars go ahead yes thank you David I just wanted to make two points really
[03:01:46.040 --> 03:01:50.960]  for one you guys are awesome me and my brother super super divide listeners to
[03:01:50.960 --> 03:01:56.800]  show telling all the right information and I know a while ago Alex mentioned
[03:01:56.800 --> 03:02:00.600]  about the Google you know headquarters moving to Texas or whatever but I just
[03:02:00.600 --> 03:02:04.840]  wanted to let you guys know that that's not the only place the cars are I live
[03:02:04.840 --> 03:02:08.760]  in Jacksonville Florida and I travel I work in St. Augustine Florida and I
[03:02:08.760 --> 03:02:13.760]  travel 95 north and south every day and over the last maybe month there's been
[03:02:13.760 --> 03:02:18.800]  an increasing number of the driverless Google cars you know that's interesting
[03:02:18.800 --> 03:02:24.160]  the pre-assist yeah it's crazy and I've seen it about maybe it was maybe about a
[03:02:24.160 --> 03:02:28.760]  week two weeks ago and what's crazy about it is there'll be a driverless car
[03:02:28.760 --> 03:02:33.680]  but three or four cars behind there's an unmarked white panel fan that I believe
[03:02:33.680 --> 03:02:38.480]  is the control thing that that mimics it and everybody is talking about it
[03:02:38.480 --> 03:02:41.600]  around here everybody my work's like oh man we saw the Google car so I just I
[03:02:41.600 --> 03:02:45.360]  wanted to get your guys's take on that design I think it's just gonna get worse
[03:02:45.360 --> 03:02:49.140]  and worse and I really agree with the point that Alex made about you know
[03:02:49.140 --> 03:02:53.600]  insurance companies are gonna charge you as a human to drive your own car now I
[03:02:53.600 --> 03:02:57.280]  really won't they will use insurance companies to force you out of your car
[03:02:57.280 --> 03:03:01.400]  you know I wouldn't have a problem with self-driving cars if people wanted to use
[03:03:01.400 --> 03:03:03.680]  that for their commute we were just talking about that in the office the
[03:03:03.680 --> 03:03:07.040]  other day I wouldn't have a problem with somebody doing that as long as they
[03:03:07.040 --> 03:03:10.160]  don't have a problem with me driving my own car but they are gonna have a problem
[03:03:10.160 --> 03:03:14.560]  with me every accent is gonna be blamed on me they're gonna tell me that human
[03:03:14.560 --> 03:03:17.800]  drivers are the problem but human programmers never make mistakes that's
[03:03:17.800 --> 03:03:20.480]  going to be the line that they take and we've already seen the Google cars in
[03:03:20.480 --> 03:03:23.640]  California have twice the number of accidents they do other places and it's
[03:03:23.640 --> 03:03:26.600]  interesting because in California they got some permission with this but in
[03:03:26.600 --> 03:03:30.680]  other states like Texas it's in a gray area they didn't get explicit permission
[03:03:30.680 --> 03:03:35.880]  and they drove a self-driving car Delphi drove it from California to New York so
[03:03:35.880 --> 03:03:40.760]  they're passing through all the states in between and using it as a self-driving
[03:03:40.760 --> 03:03:45.200]  car I think that's interesting but yeah they're gonna try to push us out and
[03:03:45.200 --> 03:03:49.120]  it's very dead here's the thing whatever your preference is I know there's a lot
[03:03:49.120 --> 03:03:52.080]  of people who don't like to drive cars but understand they are going to control
[03:03:52.080 --> 03:03:55.560]  your movement they're not only going to just track you but they will control
[03:03:55.560 --> 03:03:59.120]  your movement they'll do an instant audit on you and say you know what I you owe
[03:03:59.120 --> 03:04:01.960]  this tax or whatever you're not going anywhere you're not going to work you're
[03:04:01.960 --> 03:04:05.040]  not going to the grocery store until you pay this will debit it out of your
[03:04:05.040 --> 03:04:07.960]  account because you know we don't have cash anymore that's the way they're
[03:04:07.960 --> 03:04:12.560]  going to impose this control grid transportation is a very important point
[03:04:12.560 --> 03:04:16.040]  of control just look at what's going on with the TSA you want to see that kind
[03:04:16.040 --> 03:04:19.440]  of control put on to the roads that's what they're going to do thank you Kevin
[03:04:19.440 --> 03:04:25.720]  let's go to Stephen in Florida go ahead Stephen yeah hang on a sec here yeah
