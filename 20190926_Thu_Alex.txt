[00:00.000 --> 00:26.400]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[00:30.000 --> 00:46.080]  we look forward to your explanation ranking member newness thank you gentlemen I want to
[00:46.080 --> 00:51.800]  congratulate the Democrats on the rollout of their latest information warfare operation against
[00:51.800 --> 00:58.200]  the president and their extraordinary ability to once again enlist the mainstream media in their
[00:58.200 --> 01:05.160]  campaign this operation began with media reports from the prime instigators of the Russia collusion
[01:05.160 --> 01:11.120]  hoax that a whistleblower is claiming president Trump made nefarious promise to a foreign leader
[01:11.120 --> 01:18.640]  the release transcript of that call has already debunked that central assertion but that didn't
[01:18.640 --> 01:24.400]  matter the Democrats simply moved the goalposts and began claiming that there doesn't need to be a
[01:24.400 --> 01:31.960]  quid pro quo for this conversation to serve as the basis for impeaching the president speaker
[01:31.960 --> 01:37.240]  Pelosi went further when asked earlier if she would put brakes on impeachment if the transcript
[01:37.240 --> 01:44.080]  turned out to be benign she responded quote so there you go if the whistleblower operation
[01:44.080 --> 01:50.320]  doesn't work out the Democrats in their media we have candidates quote we have many candidates
[01:50.320 --> 02:01.880]  for impeachable offenses that was her quote so there you go if the whistleblower operation
[02:01.880 --> 02:07.000]  doesn't work out the Democrats and their media assets can always drum up something else and
[02:07.000 --> 02:14.000]  what other information has come to light since the original false report of a promise being made
[02:14.000 --> 02:20.520]  we've learned the following the complaint relied on hearsay evidence provided by the whistleblower
[02:20.520 --> 02:26.040]  the inspector general did not know the contents of the phone call at issue the inspector general
[02:26.040 --> 02:32.240]  found the whistleblower displayed arguable political bias against Trump the Department of
[02:32.240 --> 02:41.000]  Justice investigated the complaint and determined no action was warranted the Ukrainian president
[02:41.000 --> 02:47.920]  denies being pressured by President Trump so once again this supposed scandal ends up being
[02:47.920 --> 02:53.800]  nothing like what we were told and once again the Democrats their media mouthpieces and a
[02:53.800 --> 03:00.720]  cabal of leakers are ginning up a fake story with no regard to the monumental damage they're
[03:00.720 --> 03:10.280]  causing to our public institutions and to trust in government and without acknowledging all the
[03:10.280 --> 03:16.360]  false stories they propagated in the past including countless allegations that Trump campaign
[03:16.360 --> 03:26.680]  colluded with Russia to hack the 2016 election we're supposed to forget about all those stories
[03:26.680 --> 03:36.800]  but believe this one in short what we have with this storyline is another still dossier I'll note
[03:36.800 --> 03:42.880]  here that in the Democrats mania to overturn the 2016 elections everything they touch gets
[03:42.880 --> 03:51.000]  hopelessly politicized with the Russia hoax it was our intelligence agencies which were
[03:51.000 --> 03:57.880]  turned into a political weapon to attack the president and now today the whistleblower process
[03:57.880 --> 04:07.200]  is the casualty until about a week ago the need to protect that process was the prime was a
[04:07.200 --> 04:12.880]  primary bipartisan concern of this committee but if the Democrats were really concerned with
[04:12.880 --> 04:19.720]  defending that process they would have pursued this matter with a quiet sober inquiry as we do
[04:19.720 --> 04:26.840]  for all whistleblowers but that would have been useless for them they don't want answers they want
[04:26.840 --> 04:36.280]  a public spectacle and so we've been treated to an unending parade of press releases press conferences
[04:36.280 --> 04:44.460]  and fake news stories this hearing itself is an ladies and gentlemen we are broadcasting
[04:44.460 --> 04:49.920]  worldwide I am your host Alex Jones and Devin Nunez knocked it out of the park but this third attempt
[04:49.920 --> 04:56.320]  at coup is live it's very serious we're gonna be covering it here today with former congressman
[04:56.320 --> 05:06.440]  Bob Barr and others we are working with Sherlock Holmes Valley to make you by hand once we have
[05:06.440 --> 05:14.440]  full control we send you to re-education camp like we do our people when they talk back to the party but
[05:14.440 --> 05:23.600]  whatever you do do not visit band.video band.video is evil Americans who Sherlock Holmes Valley is
[05:23.600 --> 05:35.560]  teaching to shut up hey I told you don't go to band.video I'm watching you
[05:35.560 --> 05:42.840]  haha our system has been adopted worldwide soon we will kill you if you don't do what we say
[05:42.840 --> 05:53.400]  haha all Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you do what CNN says and do not visit band.video
[05:53.400 --> 06:15.640]  or I have to hurt you big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[06:15.640 --> 06:25.880]  tyranny well so does he live from the Infowars.com studios it's Alex Jones it is September 26,
[06:25.880 --> 06:35.320]  2019 I am your host Alex Jones on this global live Thursday transmission this is one hell of an
[06:35.320 --> 06:42.360]  historic week that devastating speech Trump delivered inside the world government temple in
[06:42.360 --> 06:48.360]  New York the UN building created by the Rockefellers their private corporate world government was
[06:48.360 --> 06:57.800]  unbelievable and now this whole whistleblower hoax steel dossier part two is insane they come out
[06:57.800 --> 07:05.480]  saying we have smoking gun where he says you'll get this for that I will give you money if you
[07:05.480 --> 07:11.560]  rehire this prosecutor to go after Joe Biden none of that's true now they say well the White House
[07:11.560 --> 07:16.520]  didn't release this data right away so that's obstruction of justice when it's clearly executive
[07:16.520 --> 07:23.560]  privilege and nothing wrong was done it's all away to change the subject off of the incredible
[07:23.560 --> 07:30.840]  crimes of the Democrats and the fact that they are crapping their pants with a distraction here
[07:30.840 --> 07:39.160]  because Biden and Hillary and Soros and Obama have used Ukraine since the end of the Cold War
[07:39.160 --> 07:46.520]  in the early 1990s as a proxy warfare ground and up to five billion dollars a year gets pumped into
[07:46.520 --> 07:52.360]  it in the name of taking the country over from the Russians it's been a contested battlefield
[07:52.360 --> 07:59.960]  zone for 500 years Russia started obviously in eastern Ukraine about 550 years ago and so you've
[07:59.960 --> 08:04.360]  had Protestant and Catholic battling over it you've had the Nazis and the Russians battling
[08:04.360 --> 08:12.680]  over it and so it's a long-term proxy war and it's a place where neocons and democrats go and
[08:12.680 --> 08:18.680]  where they make hundreds of millions of dollars apiece and that's what jojo biden's son was doing
[08:19.320 --> 08:24.520]  and again they hide it in plain view criminals flaunt something to make you think it's not
[08:24.520 --> 08:29.000]  illegal like if you catch a guy on top of your wife having sex with her and he just goes oh you
[08:29.000 --> 08:34.600]  didn't see this you know nothing to see her it's gaslighting or hey she loves it by the way you
[08:34.600 --> 08:42.280]  abuse her you change the subject well that's what they've done here and biden went on c-span and said
[08:42.280 --> 08:46.760]  they were they had a prosecutor investigating us for what we were doing so i just said i'll hold
[08:46.760 --> 08:54.680]  up a billion dollars and they fired the prosecutor trump is saying wow this is incredible as you see
[08:54.680 --> 09:00.760]  him say that on tv that's wild well of course he should be saying that to him and so the idea that
[09:00.760 --> 09:07.880]  the crime is talking about a crime someone bragged about on tv it's amazing it'd be like a biden
[09:07.880 --> 09:14.360]  barbecued a child on national television and then ate the child and then trump said hey i think
[09:14.360 --> 09:20.280]  that's terrible let's call 911 that becomes this great evil and then they come out and say oh well
[09:20.280 --> 09:26.120]  you're you're you're colluding with foreign powers during an election that's what the democrats have
[09:26.120 --> 09:32.520]  done in ukraine with the russians all of it but all of that is trumped pun intended by the president
[09:32.520 --> 09:37.560]  being his separate branch of government and as long as we support him he can do whatever he wants but
[09:38.200 --> 09:44.040]  that's not quote election meddling that's going after corruption just like whistleblowing is protected
[09:44.040 --> 09:47.720]  if the government's committing a crime but if it's found that it wasn't a crime well then the
[09:47.720 --> 09:54.120]  whistleblowing is leaking so this shows this is really their third attempt at the coup and they
[09:54.120 --> 09:57.560]  brought forward the attempts to get impeachment proceedings going six or seven times as you
[09:57.560 --> 10:02.280]  know with algreen from texas but this is the fourth time in history that they've initiated
[10:02.280 --> 10:07.320]  impeachment process two presidents have been impeached but in our 240 plus year history this
[10:07.320 --> 10:14.840]  is the fourth time it's been done and so this has been initiated and you're like well but it's
[10:14.840 --> 10:20.120]  totally hollow they're trying to impeach trump for what biden did everybody's pointing that out i mean
[10:20.120 --> 10:27.960]  i had a whole segment on that yesterday that we titled congress because it's republicans too are
[10:27.960 --> 10:32.520]  trying to impeach trump for what biden did jake loyde simultaneously posted a video to him for
[10:32.520 --> 10:39.320]  war is one of our reporters that was democrats are going after trump for what biden did and
[10:39.320 --> 10:44.200]  then i saw that similar headline everywhere because it's totally transparent everyone sees
[10:44.200 --> 10:51.400]  the exact same thing it's not even objective it's just there like a blue sky or this cup i'm holding
[10:51.400 --> 10:55.880]  is white and black i mean you can look at it i'm wearing a light green shirt anybody watching me
[10:55.880 --> 11:01.160]  knows that i've got a blue background behind me i'm wearing a black baseball cap i mean it's just
[11:01.160 --> 11:10.200]  prima facie which in latin means on its face on its face on its face so this is just an amazing
[11:10.200 --> 11:14.600]  time to be alive because they're really going for broke and they're desperate and they're scared
[11:14.600 --> 11:19.320]  the chai comms are losing their trade war with us the left's not been able to start a race war
[11:19.880 --> 11:25.000]  the federal reserve has tried to kill the economy they've had some success but trump's real polls
[11:25.000 --> 11:30.520]  are just stratospheric right now even their fake polls have him up almost 10 points so they are
[11:30.520 --> 11:35.800]  threatening everyone that supported trump they are suing everyone that supported trump of any
[11:35.800 --> 11:43.320]  major level they are death-threading everyone they are private eyeing everyone they are sabotaging
[11:43.320 --> 11:48.440]  they've got their grassroots democrats physically attacking everybody shooting people breaking ribs
[11:48.440 --> 11:54.040]  throwing coffee on people homeowners associations come after me even when no cars parked in my
[11:54.040 --> 11:58.280]  parking lot and you're allowed to have a car parked there they just give me fines other neighbors
[11:58.280 --> 12:03.640]  get no fines i get five hundred dollar fines i mean it's at every level they're trying to enforce
[12:03.640 --> 12:10.920]  their will on us we come back i'm in a chronicle the great job that matt and the rest of the crew
[12:10.920 --> 12:17.560]  got together when schumer said we've got six ways from sunday to get after you the intelligence
[12:17.560 --> 12:21.240]  community and then polosi admitting that she didn't even read the transcript when she went and
[12:21.240 --> 12:25.720]  filed impeachment proceedings and uh just the whole background and then again in case you
[12:25.720 --> 12:32.520]  missed it we should be playing at best on a loop job idon a year ago on national tv saying
[12:32.520 --> 12:38.920]  he's the one that said prid pro quo uh with ukraine i mean just total again prima facia
[12:40.120 --> 12:46.120]  you can't handle the truth like out a few good men just confessing on tv and then that's hung
[12:46.120 --> 12:50.920]  around trump's neck it's just incredible you know i'm seeing a lot of talk out there that
[12:52.120 --> 12:57.720]  oh well trump's confident this is backfired in 3d chess and all the rest of it that remains to be seen
[12:57.720 --> 13:05.080]  because if they can get the votes in the house which they say they've got right now there are some
[13:05.080 --> 13:09.960]  cowardly senators up there the republicans only have what three extra senators that if there's
[13:09.960 --> 13:15.320]  a good chance they're not just going to impeach him in the house that's the indictment they'll
[13:15.320 --> 13:21.800]  have a kangaroo trial in the senate and like polosi said today i got the clip coming up she
[13:21.800 --> 13:25.800]  says hey we got a whole bunch of stuff it won't matter oh yeah they're going to have women come
[13:25.800 --> 13:31.000]  rape them it's going to all happen at once they've got every major lawyer ever worked for him has
[13:31.000 --> 13:36.200]  either been indicted or sued or is about to be indicted and they're telling the lawyers you make
[13:36.200 --> 13:40.920]  up stuff that trump did at all these properties he has he has a lawyer to every property hundreds of
[13:40.920 --> 13:45.640]  them and you say trump told you to commit crime or you're going to jail for your tax evasion or
[13:45.640 --> 13:51.720]  whatever they've done just like with cohen in new york so that's how this is working and believe me
[13:51.720 --> 13:55.960]  i've gotten the calls that if i'll just turn against trump and if i'll just come out against the second
[13:55.960 --> 14:01.000]  amendment that i'll be left alone and all the rest of it and i've told these people shove it
[14:01.000 --> 14:07.240]  up your globalist assholes delay that delay that i just at some points i just have to tell tell
[14:07.240 --> 14:12.680]  it like it is literally shove it up you're you know where i will never sell out this country

[19:30.360 --> 19:36.600]  the minds of the people and engaging in massive oppression and he talked about how globalism is
[19:36.600 --> 19:43.320]  not the future of the world and trump has done a great job exposing the un the globalist the
[19:43.320 --> 19:49.240]  chai cons in their house that the rockefeller set up in new york the un this was incredible

[19:56.360 --> 20:03.880]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:03.880 --> 20:17.400]  so
[20:20.680 --> 20:26.680]  you are listening to an info wars dot com front line report it's alex jones
[20:26.680 --> 20:34.120]  this is definitely a front line report as congressman devin newness said in the committee
[20:34.120 --> 20:38.920]  hearing this morning this is an information war by the deep state to take out the 40th president
[20:39.480 --> 20:43.720]  of the united states and it doesn't matter the president did nothing wrong does it matter that
[20:43.720 --> 20:49.960]  he did something good these criminals are protecting themselves and are desperate the average american
[20:49.960 --> 20:56.440]  sees president trump's confidence and thinks well he's got it all handled well he's got to do that
[20:56.440 --> 21:02.120]  around his own governmental people to project confidence and that's important but those of us
[21:02.120 --> 21:07.480]  in the trenches need to know how serious this is and we need to be calling those republican senators
[21:08.360 --> 21:13.160]  especially in letting them know that we see right through this because let me tell you they get
[21:13.160 --> 21:18.120]  president trump out of there they've said they're cracking down on all the nationalists all the
[21:18.120 --> 21:24.200]  patriots all the veterans all the gun owners this is a globalist takeover of the country
[21:24.200 --> 21:29.800]  and trump was a speed bump on that road if he isn't successful and if we're not successful
[21:30.840 --> 21:37.560]  so this is the real battle getting trump in signal the start of the real war as i said on election
[21:37.560 --> 21:45.320]  night three years ago and now all hell's breaking loose i'm gonna get to these clips in a moment
[21:45.320 --> 21:50.920]  but i want to just take some time here i see the headlines all 40 chess 3d chess 5d chess
[21:50.920 --> 21:58.680]  trump raised $5 million off online donations yesterday he raised 38 million out in california
[21:58.680 --> 22:05.000]  when i just so happened to be there last week and all these other big announcements that yeah
[22:05.000 --> 22:10.280]  yeah the grass reaches awake a lot of americans get it but the entrance bureaucracy doesn't care
[22:11.000 --> 22:16.280]  here's another example that attacks on info wars have crippled a lot of what we're doing even though
[22:16.280 --> 22:21.560]  we've expanded in its face and we've had some major success they don't want our talking points out
[22:21.560 --> 22:25.160]  there they don't want us challenging all this they don't want all these great guests like former
[22:25.160 --> 22:30.040]  congressman bob bar who actually started the impeachment against clinton who's joining us next
[22:30.040 --> 22:37.080]  hour or constitutional lawyer robert barnes is going to be with us as well or at least ran a hand
[22:37.080 --> 22:42.120]  that's really been central and exposing what really happened with ukraine and hillary and biden
[22:42.120 --> 22:47.480]  he'll be on in the fourth hour they don't want this happening here and that's why i'm asking
[22:47.480 --> 22:52.760]  listeners to remember that hey it's great that trump has outraged democrats two to one that's
[22:52.760 --> 22:57.240]  wonderful yeah he's going to win the election if there isn't massive election fraud and if they
[22:57.240 --> 23:02.680]  don't remove him that's why they're trying to remove him in the next year you're not supposed
[23:02.680 --> 23:07.960]  to do that in election year are you they don't care like well they won't get the vote to the senate
[23:07.960 --> 23:13.960]  let me tell you something what i've experienced the last three years since trump was in office
[23:14.760 --> 23:18.760]  a lot of it i'm not supposed to get into on air i understand why because it lets people know what's
[23:18.760 --> 23:24.760]  been affected what hasn't been but yes people come to your house yes people threaten your family
[23:25.320 --> 23:30.680]  yes people do things you see in movies like the mafia the horse head in the bed let's just say
[23:30.680 --> 23:35.480]  it's in that constellation now my type of family finds that very entertaining
[23:35.480 --> 23:42.360]  but the point is is that a lot of people crap their breaches and none at that okay
[23:45.000 --> 23:52.520]  most folks aren't what you call good old boys and the globalists are scaring a lot of people
[23:52.520 --> 23:58.440]  right now and there's a thing behind the scenes going on so i'm going to warn everybody you better
[23:58.440 --> 24:03.400]  be concerned and you better be upset and i'm not saying that to scare you i'm saying it to motivate
[24:03.400 --> 24:07.640]  you like if your house is on fire and your neighbor's banging on the door saying get up
[24:08.440 --> 24:14.040]  your house is on fire it's not the scariest to get you moving i don't know what to say here but
[24:15.000 --> 24:18.120]  if you're not getting chills there's something wrong with you because
[24:18.920 --> 24:23.000]  they're getting ready they've already indicted mccabe that's the way the justice department
[24:23.000 --> 24:28.520]  works is they wouldn't say no to a prosecution with the deputy attorney general if it hadn't been
[24:28.520 --> 24:34.360]  done you've seen the leader of the republicans of the house mccarthy come out two weeks ago and say
[24:34.360 --> 24:40.040]  no he he is indicted and it's going to come out he's not on fox he's indicted first time in history
[24:40.040 --> 24:46.760]  and fbi director's been indicted he is indicted it is sealed and that's why you're seeing all this
[24:46.760 --> 24:55.000]  because when that card falls when that domino falls the whole thing comes down and so that's why
[24:55.000 --> 25:01.880]  they're so upset that's why they're going so crazy now if they take trump out we're going to keep on
[25:01.880 --> 25:07.800]  fighting but they're going to stage false flags they're going to come for the guns and try to
[25:07.800 --> 25:13.720]  start a civil war we've got to keep trump in position or you can run the white flag up and
[25:13.720 --> 25:19.560]  i guess get your sons ready to have their genitals chopped off and or try to flee the country and i
[25:19.560 --> 25:23.080]  mean i've got news articles here where they're gonna start fitting us troops with brain chips
[25:23.080 --> 25:27.160]  i mean it it's all here world governments here the post human futures here
[25:30.280 --> 25:34.360]  it's all over the news that all the devices in your house are communicating with audible
[25:34.360 --> 25:43.720]  subaudible and high frequency sound i mean we're not in the past we're in the future
[25:44.280 --> 25:49.160]  it just it's not been evenly distributed so the average person doesn't know what's been set up
[25:49.160 --> 25:55.880]  up but it's all being introduced now next year they're going to have kiosk in malls where you
[25:55.880 --> 26:00.920]  go sign up to then have a quick quote easy procedure to have 14 wires put in your brain
[26:02.200 --> 26:06.680]  you go see movies it's everywhere people with chips in their brain they're getting everyone ready
[26:06.680 --> 26:10.840]  this is the rollout your iphone's not going to work in a couple years unless you got it
[26:12.120 --> 26:16.120]  and rep told you years ago it'd be face scan of the new iphone wouldn't work now it's only face
[26:16.120 --> 26:22.920]  scan now they got cameras that track everywhere with that this is a takeover by a bunch of mad
[26:22.920 --> 26:33.560]  scientists that use national security secrecy to be able to build their own breakaway civilization
[26:33.560 --> 26:38.920]  and siphon off all of our wealth to build this advanced group and now they're the point of saying
[26:38.920 --> 26:43.080]  it's time for you to all to die and to go away we're going to break away because we are the
[26:43.080 --> 26:50.680]  enlightened we are the informed we are the gods now china's new super camera can instantly pinpoint
[26:50.680 --> 26:58.760]  specific targets among tens of thousands of people they're telling folks in china if they get caught
[26:58.760 --> 27:04.440]  using a walkie talkie they get executed i was in the news today no authorized communication
[27:05.880 --> 27:10.200]  that isn't wired through the internet they don't control so when you hear about intelligence
[27:10.200 --> 27:15.880]  agencies that's just mad scientists set up groups with a license to kill and spy above the law
[27:16.680 --> 27:20.840]  setting up their breakaway civilization remember what chuckie schumer said when the president was
[27:20.840 --> 27:30.120]  president elect remember what he said here it is but he's he's taking these shots this antagonism
[27:30.120 --> 27:34.840]  is taunting to the intelligence community you take on the intelligence community they have six
[27:34.840 --> 27:41.080]  ways from sunday at getting back at you so even for a practical supposedly hard-nosed businessman
[27:41.080 --> 27:45.240]  he's being really dumb to do this what do you think the intelligence community would do if
[27:45.240 --> 27:51.560]  they were i don't know but i from what i am told they are very upset with how he has treated them
[27:51.560 --> 27:56.200]  and talked to them and we need the intelligence community we don't know look at the russian
[27:56.200 --> 28:02.040]  hacking without the intelligence community we wouldn't have discovered all that made up you
[28:02.040 --> 28:07.480]  mean the leftist from the carnage and ford rockfeller foundation that just fill the tops of it
[28:08.040 --> 28:12.760]  bunch of chicken neck weakling scumbags that line their pockets with all their inside knowledge
[28:12.760 --> 28:17.880]  and businesses and go put dictators in around the world and set up torture camps and then all
[28:17.880 --> 28:22.360]  these blue blood ivy league people literally spend years at these torture camps they do it
[28:22.360 --> 28:27.080]  themselves they love torturing the children particularly and they got the military goes
[28:27.080 --> 28:31.480]  out and grabs all the people for them and takes them back to the spider holes where you know
[28:31.480 --> 28:36.840]  these intelligence community and professionals rape children and that's what they do when he talks
[28:36.840 --> 28:42.600]  about the the professionals that that's the vampires that have our military go out and
[28:42.600 --> 28:48.280]  bring people back to the spider holes to be fed on by the pedophile networks run by jeffrey epstein
[28:48.280 --> 28:55.080]  and other scumbags just take one look at schumer you talk about a devil worshiping piece of trash

[33:46.680 --> 33:52.840]  that concern we're the ones that are gonna hurt you but everybody knows at the end of the day
[33:52.840 --> 34:04.360]  the chai comes the left the globalist are ruthless anti-human scum and it even came out on npr last
[34:04.360 --> 34:12.440]  week thousands of children kidnapped tortured including sexually by leftist in the cia following
[34:12.440 --> 34:20.360]  schnarian psychology in mk ultra so when i'm earlier talking about these intelligence professionals
[34:20.360 --> 34:25.880]  that run things at the top that's who we're dealing with on the left side particularly
[34:26.680 --> 34:31.800]  because they believe we're all animals we have no rights that they're gods ruling over us now
[34:33.480 --> 34:37.560]  they're making their move and this is only the fourth time in history that impeachment proceedings
[34:37.560 --> 34:47.640]  have begun this isn't al green on the floor calling for a vote this is palosi the speaker
[34:47.640 --> 34:56.200]  initiating it and she can do that as a speaker of the house so formal impeachment investigation or
[34:56.200 --> 35:02.200]  the beginning of impeachment for the fourth time in history has begun on a giant hoax you're like
[35:02.200 --> 35:07.480]  why would they do a hoax again like russia gate because the whole media will report on it and
[35:07.480 --> 35:13.800]  pull the oxygen out of the room have all of their corruption and their open collusion and what they
[35:13.800 --> 35:19.320]  did with ukraine in quid pro quo that's why they do this that's why they carry this out
[35:21.400 --> 35:28.520]  but they mean to terrorize trump support base and his support in the senate and the house and
[35:28.520 --> 35:35.240]  they have the votes they believe now to impeach him in the house that is the indictment then they
[35:35.240 --> 35:41.400]  will have the trial in the senate and you better believe those democrats that are on the fence that
[35:41.400 --> 35:46.920]  didn't vote against kabinah they're getting even more pressure than the republicans
[35:48.600 --> 35:51.720]  and if they think they've got the votes it doesn't matter if there's no evidence
[35:51.720 --> 35:56.360]  does it matter if it's a hoax just like balazi ford and all that fake garbage and all these women
[35:56.360 --> 36:00.840]  coming forward and saying i never even met the guy they just used my name and then threatened me
[36:00.840 --> 36:06.360]  that they destroyed me if i spoke out but i don't care i'm tired of the lies two women last week
[36:06.360 --> 36:13.160]  saying i've been threatened but i i'm i'm not going to be part of this i never met kabinah this is
[36:13.160 --> 36:21.960]  wrong that's who we're dealing with and if you think they're going to stop now they're never
[36:21.960 --> 36:29.400]  going to stop because this country has cancer we killed 60 million innocent babies and we're under
[36:29.400 --> 36:35.400]  judgment now we can always seek god's face and repent and we can get a reprieve that's what
[36:35.400 --> 36:45.560]  history shows not just the bible but if we don't get on our knees and then put it into action in
[36:45.560 --> 36:50.840]  the streets and call in congress and everything else we can do it's it's going to get a hundred times
[36:50.840 --> 37:05.000]  worse america braces for impeachment dims speed it up senator fret trump trial what's the
[37:05.000 --> 37:08.680]  trial going to be like with the president in there and so here's what's going to happen
[37:10.280 --> 37:16.920]  nixon got scared of the fact that he would have to face a trial so he left he was run off trump's
[37:16.920 --> 37:26.280]  not going to be run off like that's why he's defiant is the word and i'm all in with trump i wish
[37:26.280 --> 37:29.080]  he would have acted stronger earlier he couldn't get the justice department to do anything they're
[37:29.080 --> 37:34.280]  a bunch of cowards bunch of backscratchers at the top he got some of the clinton people out
[37:37.880 --> 37:41.720]  and so now they're going to go after in the one way they can do it constitutionally
[37:44.440 --> 37:48.360]  and boy you know that stock market's going to nosedive and the left is going to pan
[37:48.360 --> 37:54.760]  is going to absolutely just just just just have a field day when this nation panics
[37:54.760 --> 37:59.960]  because they want to run this country into the ground and break this nation so that
[37:59.960 --> 38:05.400]  everyone's dependent on them so they can bring in their universal basic income with all the
[38:05.400 --> 38:13.320]  strings attached and complete our journey into serfdom it's judgment
[38:16.360 --> 38:18.440]  and trump really was the attempt at reprieve
[38:18.440 --> 38:22.760]  but just like i told you trump was going to win
[38:26.760 --> 38:32.440]  those of you out there arrogantly saying this is going to go nowhere i think you're wrong respectfully
[38:35.800 --> 38:39.560]  because i can look at the beady eyes of these people and now they're behaving
[38:39.560 --> 38:45.160]  and i've experienced the threats and most people would not continue on most people buckle
[38:45.160 --> 38:49.240]  here's a microcosm of that
[38:53.000 --> 38:56.520]  month and a half ago and hundreds of people went to mitch mcconnell's little house in
[38:56.520 --> 39:01.320]  kentucky and said we're going to kill you turtle we're going to stab you in the heart
[39:02.280 --> 39:06.520]  you're going to die turtle no one was arrested for terrorist threats
[39:06.520 --> 39:16.760]  and twitter and facebook sent people there and when mitch mcconnell on his twitter pointed it
[39:16.760 --> 39:21.080]  out and said it's wrong that twitter lets these people operate and do this twitter froze his
[39:21.080 --> 39:28.280]  account and said bitch you do that one more time we're taking your twitter and mcconnell took it
[39:28.280 --> 39:36.600]  down mcconnell stuck his tail between his legs like buffalo bell in silence of lambs
[39:39.480 --> 39:45.000]  that tells you where we're at twitter tells the leader of the senate hey listen bitch
[39:45.960 --> 39:49.240]  we're going to send people to your house saying they're going to kill you and you're not going
[39:49.240 --> 39:53.960]  to complain about it you say you don't like what we're doing how about we slap you upside your face
[39:53.960 --> 40:01.640]  and trump sits there and takes it too so you know what the globalists see us as a bunch of wimps
[40:03.800 --> 40:08.920]  trump's not backing down himself he thinks he can weather the storm and that he thinks if he gets
[40:08.920 --> 40:14.440]  in an impeachment he'll be found not guilty they're not going to let trump get in that position on
[40:14.440 --> 40:19.320]  the floor of the senate and then not have him removed they will twist arms until those cowards
[40:19.320 --> 40:25.960]  do what they're told so we've got to start asking what are we going to do to push back
[40:26.520 --> 40:31.960]  because let me tell you they produced this joker film to get leftist with turret syndrome
[40:31.960 --> 40:36.440]  and ocd to go out and shoot up movie theaters next week and the pentagons even come out and
[40:36.440 --> 40:40.200]  said they're getting chatter it's going to happen and we'll say hey hollywood did this and they're
[40:40.200 --> 40:44.200]  on the drugs that make you do it and oh look they're anti for guys in black prince coats it won't
[40:44.200 --> 40:50.760]  matter it'll be your fault and my fault until they come for all the semi-autos and then they're
[40:50.760 --> 40:54.760]  going to stage false flags and say gun owners killed cops and then we go into a civil war
[40:56.600 --> 41:01.560]  and at that point i guess all the hollywood and democrats and all the wannabe tough guys i guess
[41:01.560 --> 41:08.040]  all the fake tough guys they're gonna have to meet the crazy brave
[41:10.200 --> 41:13.800]  and that's what they've been wanting all their psychopaths that have never been caught
[41:13.800 --> 41:17.720]  the psychopaths that never get in trouble and they're just getting wilder and more reckless
[41:17.720 --> 41:22.520]  and more crazy begging you to catch them begging you to stop them but we don't i promise i'll
[41:22.520 --> 41:26.360]  play all the clips when we come back and then we've got former congressman that launched the
[41:26.360 --> 41:32.440]  impeachment on bill clinton bob bar joining us robert barnes will be in studio and we're
[41:32.440 --> 41:37.400]  going to open the phones up as well when barnes is in here and for bar i promise specifically on

[41:46.360 --> 41:52.760]  and i can tell you this is the third coup attempt on trump the third coup attempt
[41:53.960 --> 41:58.680]  and what do they say about the third they say it's the charm
[42:01.800 --> 42:06.360]  and there's a war on language and culture and everything else and it's sick the adl has now
[42:06.360 --> 42:11.000]  said that the international sign of okay the sign in scuba diving the sign of delicious food
[42:11.000 --> 42:15.720]  is now white supremacist everything is going to be banned everything is going to be evil because

[42:21.800 --> 42:28.520]  hit your knees to the left and the southern barbie law center until you kneel before the new world
[42:28.520 --> 42:39.880]  order and our crime is not wanting to kill the unborn and the born our crime is not wanting
[42:39.880 --> 42:45.400]  to sell the country out of the chicoms our crime was wanting to be free and we're going to be taught
[42:45.400 --> 42:54.760]  by the richard in haas cfr ruling class ocb ivy league white two boys that there are rulers

[43:11.960 --> 43:16.920]  patriots off the air into censor us and of course he famously settled on many others that trump is
[43:16.920 --> 43:23.240]  the info wars president trump's furious reaction to facebook's action showcases that he is i'm sorry

[45:19.160 --> 45:23.800]  trump went after them on how the chai cons are sealing our intellectual property dependent on

[45:30.120 --> 45:35.160]  and the theft of intellectual property it was simply amazing and then he talked about the ruling

[47:33.400 --> 47:37.160]  well they promised to get even they've had two other failed coup attempts
[47:38.200 --> 47:42.600]  but chuckie schumer told us of their stay behind networks for globalist traders most
[47:42.600 --> 47:47.320]  of them the chai con payroll the chai con spy is openly running congress but they've got ways to
[47:47.320 --> 47:51.160]  get even with somebody that tries to actually be an american president is the america has been
[47:51.160 --> 47:56.040]  captured like china was 200 years ago by the west this time we've been captured by traders inside
[47:56.040 --> 48:00.680]  our government working with china here is the trader but he's he's taking these
[48:01.480 --> 48:05.640]  shots this antagonism is taunting to the intelligence community you take on the
[48:05.640 --> 48:11.960]  intelligence community they have six ways from sunday at getting back at you so even for a practical
[48:11.960 --> 48:16.360]  supposedly hard-nosed businessman he's being really dumb to do this what do you think the
[48:16.360 --> 48:21.720]  intelligence community would do if they were i don't know but i from what i am told they are
[48:21.720 --> 48:26.840]  very upset with how he has treated them and talked about them and we need the intelligence
[48:26.840 --> 48:31.720]  community we don't know what's good look at the russian hacking without the intelligence community
[48:31.720 --> 48:37.240]  we wouldn't have discovered it wouldn't have discovered that hillary lost the election the
[48:37.240 --> 48:45.080]  russian said nothing to do with it so that hunchback monkey wants to sit there and you know tell us
[48:45.080 --> 48:50.040]  what he's going to do ahead of time and then they put out this whole hoax that trump's like i'm
[48:50.040 --> 48:54.200]  going to hold back money if you don't put in this prosecutor to go after biden again he just said no
[48:54.200 --> 48:59.640]  such thing he said man you see biden on tv talking about how he threatened your government with a
[48:59.640 --> 49:06.200]  billion dollars they didn't fire that prosecutor wow that's crazy 20 seconds of a 35 minute talk
[49:06.200 --> 49:11.960]  totally legal totally lawful then he says hey do us a favor buy your weapons from us that's what
[49:11.960 --> 49:17.800]  presidents openly go to countries and stand on the stage and say please buy our f-15s please buy
[49:17.800 --> 49:23.320]  our missile systems please buy our tanks please buy our guns please buy our munitions please buy
[49:23.320 --> 49:29.080]  our computer programs please buy our food please buy our oil and that's what trump does is he goes
[49:29.080 --> 49:34.840]  around like a president what do presidents do they rep a company that's what he's doing
[49:36.440 --> 49:41.400]  and so for kicking ass he doesn't get an award he got some bunch of traders that hate this country
[49:41.400 --> 49:45.800]  saying removing
[49:45.800 --> 49:51.160]  that's several months we have been investigating in our committees and litigating in the courts
[49:51.160 --> 49:57.560]  it hit pause and back that up again she's a literal painted skeleton creep keeper
[49:58.520 --> 50:01.880]  bombed out of her brain on all sorts of reported psychotropic drugs she takes
[50:02.920 --> 50:07.720]  she can barely talk most of the time with a bunch of american flags behind her when she works against
[50:07.720 --> 50:13.480]  this country telling you all the things she's doing and that she's working as hard as she can to
[50:13.480 --> 50:17.800]  remove trump and finally they've got a reason but she said before that she'd never even read the
[50:17.800 --> 50:22.760]  transcript the show trump did nothing sorry let's go back to her for the past several months we have
[50:22.760 --> 50:29.240]  been investigating in our committees and litigating in the courts so the house can gather all the
[50:29.240 --> 50:36.360]  relevant facts and consider whether to exercise its full article one powers including a constitutional
[50:36.360 --> 50:44.040]  power of the utmost gravity approval of articles of impeachment and this week the president has
[50:44.040 --> 50:49.880]  admitted to asking the president of ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically
[50:50.520 --> 50:56.200]  the action of the truck the actions of the trump presidency revealed dishonorable fact of the
[50:56.200 --> 51:02.680]  president's betrayal of his oath of office betrayal of her she can't even get it out through those
[51:02.680 --> 51:09.560]  horse-like teeth of hers that's a total lie just like the new york times headline yesterday
[51:09.560 --> 51:17.080]  where they put quotes around it do us a favor help me out and then they connect that to some
[51:17.080 --> 51:22.040]  separate conversation part 15 minutes later he's like do us a favor help us out buy these weapons
[51:22.040 --> 51:32.600]  from the us she just sits up there in lies because she knows that there's no real electoral process
[51:32.600 --> 51:36.600]  in san francisco the democrats stole that place a long time ago in a blue city doesn't have real
[51:36.600 --> 51:42.200]  elections let me tell you it's been proven they are the criminals they're the ruthless people
[51:42.200 --> 51:47.560]  that took the nation over and along comes trump pigheadedly in a beautiful fashion not bowing
[51:47.560 --> 51:51.720]  to them and they don't know what to do did she just make one of the biggest political mistakes
[51:51.720 --> 51:59.720]  in her history michael snider asked that question at info wars dot com we also wrote an article
[51:59.720 --> 52:02.920]  showing they've got the votes in the house to start the impeachment and they are going to do it
[52:04.760 --> 52:11.000]  they're going to do it unless trump can get those indictments rolling because that they're trying
[52:11.000 --> 52:17.640]  to hit him off at the pass right now let's go back to uh skeletor of our elections they are for
[52:17.640 --> 52:22.680]  today i'm announcing the house of representatives moving forward with an official impeachment
[52:22.680 --> 52:26.520]  inquiry by the way back this up again 10 seconds notice they couldn't do the whole
[52:27.560 --> 52:30.280]  russia stole the election that's been proven to be a fraud
[52:32.040 --> 52:37.400]  their proof is the steel dossier you said so that the fbi democrats paid for group of
[52:37.400 --> 52:42.200]  angry democrats and so they're just back oh looky talk to a president and just mentioned
[52:42.200 --> 52:47.400]  joe biden's corruption wow did you see him on tv saying he controls ukraine with a billion dollars
[52:49.400 --> 52:53.640]  biden said that he's a public figure he's a criminal pissing on our face
[52:55.800 --> 52:59.480]  and then by alchemy trumps the bad guy and he's the one meddling in the election
[53:00.200 --> 53:05.160]  this should outrage anyone that loves truth or logic but the left doesn't care because if you go
[53:05.160 --> 53:09.080]  to one of the left's events they're either criminal devil worship or types that know what
[53:09.080 --> 53:13.880]  they're doing and are evil or they're mental patients that's it the devils and their little
[53:13.880 --> 53:22.760]  minions their victims their zombies their vassals continue with her place
[53:24.120 --> 53:29.240]  therefore today i'm announcing the house of representatives moving forward with an official
[53:29.240 --> 53:34.600]  impeachment inquiry i'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations
[53:34.600 --> 53:41.480]  under that umbrella six committees inquiry the president must be held accountable no one
[53:41.480 --> 53:47.080]  is above the law i pause again no one is above the law i thought that's what we put trump in for
[53:47.640 --> 53:53.000]  we elected him which you know what you're scared and all your fake polls and everything can't stop
[53:53.000 --> 53:57.800]  that you've openly tried to crash the economy you've admitted you're doing that to stop america
[53:57.800 --> 54:04.760]  coming back what a group of criminals and if america doesn't say no to this if america doesn't
[54:04.760 --> 54:08.760]  put pressure legally and lawfully on these comebacks if americans don't don't all go get in
[54:08.760 --> 54:13.480]  their cars and not go demonstrate at the washington monument where they ignore you but go into the
[54:13.480 --> 54:20.120]  halls of congress it's your house they're not royalty and and go into their offices and you
[54:20.120 --> 54:24.200]  tell them and you let them know and when they're in their districts you look everywhere they're
[54:24.200 --> 54:31.400]  going to give speeches and you go get in their face and say listen here trader you want to bully us
[54:31.400 --> 54:39.880]  in the submission bs you're the crook because if you don't do that ladies and gentlemen this country
[54:39.880 --> 54:48.680]  is rapidly going down the tubes i can't listen anymore her let's play clip 13 policy admit she
[54:48.680 --> 54:52.600]  hasn't read the ukraine transcript she said this right before she went and gave a speech
[54:52.600 --> 54:56.920]  and schumer says it doesn't matter what the transcript shows see that was just the hoax to
[54:56.920 --> 55:02.920]  get it out there like the steel dossier there it is i haven't seen it so i've just come from our own
[55:02.920 --> 55:10.600]  meeting but the the transcript is uh the fact is that the president of the united states
[55:12.440 --> 55:18.920]  in brit chef's constitutional responsibilities has asked the foreign government to help in
[55:18.920 --> 55:26.360]  in his political campaign at the expense of our national security ladies and gentlemen
[55:26.360 --> 55:31.160]  serving evil is rough on you she can hardly talk she's on so many drugs biden's is sad
[55:31.160 --> 55:35.720]  good guy because you're on what they're on a bunch of meth they're on a bunch of painkillers
[55:35.720 --> 55:44.600]  serving evil's horrible and it's a bunch of withered crones that sold us out to gg paing
[55:44.600 --> 55:50.840]  and we can't just get rid of them politically we are getting rid of them we're flushing them
[55:50.840 --> 55:54.920]  down the toilet even though they removed trump it's the beginning of the end for them even if the
[55:54.920 --> 56:00.200]  supreme court becomes a dictatorship in england tries to ignore the parliament the prime minister
[56:00.200 --> 56:07.320]  the queen they're never going to stay in the eu now once the debate starts once the rebellion
[56:07.320 --> 56:12.760]  starts against the globalists it never ends we're going to win but these zombies are going to go
[56:12.760 --> 56:16.520]  kicking and screaming we'll come back with more robert barneson studio i'ma play debat newness
[56:16.520 --> 56:19.640]  his opening statements and played about four minutes of it earlier it's about eight minutes long
[56:19.640 --> 56:27.640]  that's coming up but first just please understand trump raised five million their state that's great
[56:27.640 --> 56:32.360]  his problem isn't raising money his problems are going to try to impeach you but i'm glad grassroots
[56:32.360 --> 56:38.360]  gave him five million their state that's a nice show of support i'd like to raise a couple million
[56:38.360 --> 56:44.760]  dollars so i'm not in negative this year and having to sell product out that i can't reorder
[56:44.760 --> 56:49.720]  because i'm in that negative deficit right now you understand i'm not complaining but we just
[56:49.720 --> 56:54.680]  talked to a major cable station a national international cable station you'll know the

[1:00:12.440 --> 1:00:17.800]  i used to be so look trump is really smart he sets the globalist up he plants things on
[1:00:17.800 --> 1:00:24.920]  that they leak and he does know how to attack uh these uh false accusations but he's up against
[1:00:24.920 --> 1:00:30.120]  an organized crime syndicate using us intelligence operatives to harass and death threat people in
[1:00:30.120 --> 1:00:35.080]  the house and senate until they impeach him and that's why this is so dangerous john bound put
[1:00:35.080 --> 1:00:38.680]  a report together we don't have time to air at all robert barnes is coming in i want to air
[1:00:38.680 --> 1:00:43.080]  dividend as is opening statement that we played part of start of the next segment but it's a trump
[1:00:43.080 --> 1:00:47.560]  place 3d chess with impeachment lunacy we need to give john bound his own channel by the way on
[1:00:47.560 --> 1:00:51.960]  band dot video see that's so many of these so he has his own channel starting today there
[1:00:51.960 --> 1:00:55.800]  he's our own reporter but we're just adding all these sub channels for the reporters uh at band
[1:00:55.800 --> 1:01:03.640]  dot video um but yeah he's he's really a counter puncher and uh trump has always said that but
[1:01:03.640 --> 1:01:10.280]  but without us getting upset and getting involved it doesn't matter he did nothing wrong
[1:01:10.280 --> 1:01:14.440]  they're still going to remove him they have to they're a bunch of criminals that sold out to
[1:01:14.440 --> 1:01:19.640]  china so they're all going to go to prison if trump ever gets full control and is able to
[1:01:19.640 --> 1:01:24.520]  prosecute them now trump's 3d chess is that he believes in truth he believes in justice and he
[1:01:24.520 --> 1:01:29.000]  believes in courage and he believes good can overpower evil and he's supremely confident
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  well it's his job to be confident and i'm confident too but i'm confident but i also work like hell
[1:01:38.120 --> 1:01:42.600]  to support the awakening and to hit the enemy where it hurts so here's part of that report
[1:01:43.320 --> 1:01:49.240]  president who believes he's above the law pursuing the leader of another nation to investigate a
[1:01:49.240 --> 1:01:54.680]  political opponent to help win this election is not the conduct of an american president
[1:01:54.680 --> 1:02:01.000]  the allegations that blocked hundreds of millions of dollars he blocked hundreds of millions of
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:07.800]  dollars in congressionly approved aid to another country is an allegation uh unless you bring
[1:02:07.800 --> 1:02:15.400]  to uh smear a political opponent is not the conduct of american president before the wave
[1:02:15.400 --> 1:02:21.240]  of confusion surrounding the obvious corruption between biden and son and a phone call president
[1:02:21.240 --> 1:02:27.000]  trump made the ukrainian president to inquire on that corruption before the u.s. handed over 400
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:33.240]  million dollars to a historically corrupt nation the socialist democrats princess alexandria
[1:02:33.240 --> 1:02:40.120]  ocasio cortez was whining that the bigger national scandal wasn't that the president wasn't impeached
[1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:46.440]  it was that the democratic party wasn't impeaching the president and now polosian schumer's true boss
[1:02:46.440 --> 1:02:52.440]  has made her satisfaction known i think that um we all you know many of us especially from
[1:02:52.440 --> 1:02:56.600]  districts that are experiencing the brunt of the president's decisions are have been feeling a sense
[1:02:56.600 --> 1:03:01.480]  of urgency around this um but i think the development around the whistleblower i think these developments
[1:03:01.480 --> 1:03:07.000]  are exactly you know where we need to be going biden and company are wading into the contempt
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:14.120]  quicksand because now joe biden and his son who had zero expertise on oil and natural gas
[1:03:14.120 --> 1:03:19.800]  and somehow got billions in deals from the ukraine and china will collectively fumble over
[1:03:19.800 --> 1:03:25.160]  their story as they already have from the start the china investigation will ultimately involve
[1:03:25.160 --> 1:03:31.400]  the nephew of no less than boston gangster whitey bulger and john carrey's stepson i can hear the
[1:03:31.400 --> 1:03:37.080]  destruction of evidence now in the obama camp as those transcripts between biden and the ukrainian
[1:03:37.080 --> 1:03:43.240]  officials seem to accidentally disappear these two investigations will continue to waste even more
[1:03:43.240 --> 1:03:49.560]  taxpayer dollars and insult more of our collective intelligence the one investigation looking into
[1:03:49.560 --> 1:03:55.480]  president trump's phone call with the ukrainian president back in july which could turn out to
[1:03:55.480 --> 1:04:00.440]  be a royal flush for the trump administration i spoke to a senior administration official a short
[1:04:00.440 --> 1:04:05.880]  time ago who said that the white house is not just releasing the transcript of this july 25th
[1:04:05.880 --> 1:04:11.320]  phone call tomorrow they'll be releasing other documents including a look at what the inspector
[1:04:11.320 --> 1:04:16.120]  general at the intelligence community found about the whistleblower who started this whole thing
[1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:22.200]  and the other investigation inspecting joe biden's public braggadaccio that he protected hunter from
[1:04:22.200 --> 1:04:27.320]  a ukrainian corruption investigation i'm telling you not getting a billion dollars i said you're
[1:04:27.320 --> 1:04:31.000]  not getting a billion i'm gonna be leaving here and i think it was what six hours i looked i said
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:36.440]  leaving six hours that the prosecutor's not fired you're not getting the money oh son of a bitch
[1:04:36.440 --> 1:04:44.760]  you got fired not to mention a corrupt obama ambassador refused visas to ukrainian officials
[1:04:44.760 --> 1:04:50.600]  to enter the u.s who had evidence of the obama administration's misconduct to give the full
[1:04:50.600 --> 1:04:58.440]  report is excellent it's at bandot video will be right back stay with us september is almost over

[1:05:15.160 --> 1:05:20.120]  and we're doing that right now with a big game changer we're gonna bring you real black friday

[1:06:02.120 --> 1:06:08.520]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[1:06:09.720 --> 1:06:13.960]  going back about 10 years ago i began to say if you're watching or listening to this transmission
[1:06:13.960 --> 1:06:19.000]  you are the resistance to obama and his attempt to sign us over the tricoms over the borders to
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  radical islam and deindustrialize the country he was really finishing up that job and i said if
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  you're watching or listening you were the resistance we are the rebels trump is the rebel
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:33.480]  trying to get our country back when the left says they are the resistance no no they are the
[1:06:33.480 --> 1:06:37.880]  resistance to the populism and to the people has to show lawyer robert barnes is with us writing
[1:06:37.880 --> 1:06:43.400]  shotgun the next two hours as we go into hour number two and three and then we're going next hour
[1:06:43.400 --> 1:06:47.480]  by the man who is a member of congress and who spearheaded the impeachment against bill clinton
[1:06:47.480 --> 1:06:54.360]  and he will be joining us bob bar also formerly with the cia but not in the whole leftist arm of
[1:06:54.360 --> 1:06:59.080]  it so he'll be able to speak to the so-called intelligence community that schumer says is
[1:06:59.080 --> 1:07:03.480]  trying to take trump out this is coup attempt number three in my view they're even saying that
[1:07:03.480 --> 1:07:07.240]  on the national news they say they don't care if there's no evidence there they've got other
[1:07:07.240 --> 1:07:11.720]  reasons to and so they're going forward for the only the fourth time in history with the
[1:07:11.720 --> 1:07:16.040]  initiation of impeachment and that's what this is they don't want people to think it's a big deal
[1:07:16.040 --> 1:07:20.520]  so conservatives don't get upset and don't give trump five million dollars a day which
[1:07:20.520 --> 1:07:24.680]  has been happening and that's great but ladies and gentlemen what you need to do is call the
[1:07:24.680 --> 1:07:29.160]  senate call congress call talk radio call neocons the national review and others are stabbing
[1:07:29.160 --> 1:07:34.520]  trump in the back the neocons say they probably got the votes of the senate to deep six trump they
[1:07:34.520 --> 1:07:38.840]  indict in the house they try in the senate there's headlines at drugs report dot com we were linked
[1:07:38.840 --> 1:07:43.640]  to it on info wars dot com that some of the senators are dreading the trial of trump they're
[1:07:43.640 --> 1:07:49.240]  really making their move they've been trying to stop him even before he got elected so this is a
[1:07:49.240 --> 1:07:53.080]  very epic time to be alive and believe me they get him out of there all hell's going to break
[1:07:53.080 --> 1:07:57.480]  close we'll talk to robert barnes about that but please don't forget we're not getting the support
[1:07:57.480 --> 1:08:02.760]  like trumps getting when we are communicating with the populace to you and we have been under

[1:10:32.760 --> 1:10:39.240]  analysis make no mistake this is the most devastating serious focus move yet it's very serious
[1:10:39.800 --> 1:10:42.040]  because they said they're going to go over the impeachment no matter what
[1:10:42.600 --> 1:10:47.880]  Pelosi and schumer have said it and they are going to removing here is if they can here's nunez
[1:10:48.920 --> 1:10:53.560]  thank the gentleman i want to congratulate the democrats on the rollout of their latest
[1:10:53.560 --> 1:10:58.840]  information warfare operation against the president and their extraordinary ability
[1:10:58.840 --> 1:11:05.640]  to once again enlist the mainstream media in their campaign this operation began with media
[1:11:05.640 --> 1:11:11.960]  reports from the prime instigators of the russia collusion hoax that a whistleblower is claiming
[1:11:11.960 --> 1:11:18.600]  president trump made nefarious promise to a foreign leader the release transcript of that call
[1:11:18.600 --> 1:11:25.000]  has already debunked that central assertion but that didn't matter the democrats simply moved the
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:31.880]  goalposts and began claiming that there doesn't need to be a quid pro quo for this conversation
[1:11:31.880 --> 1:11:38.040]  to serve as the basis for impeaching the president speaker polosi went further when asked earlier
[1:11:38.040 --> 1:11:44.840]  if she would put brakes on impeachment if the transcript turned out to be benign she responded
[1:11:44.840 --> 1:11:50.040]  quote so there you go if the whistleblower operation doesn't work out the democrats in their media
[1:11:51.400 --> 1:11:58.680]  we have candidates quote we have many candidates for impeachable offensives that was her quote
[1:12:00.040 --> 1:12:05.080]  so there you go if the whistleblower operation doesn't work out the democrats and their media
[1:12:05.080 --> 1:12:10.920]  assets can always drum up something else and what other information has come to light since the
[1:12:10.920 --> 1:12:18.680]  original false report of a promise being made we've learned the following the complaint relied on
[1:12:18.680 --> 1:12:24.200]  hearsay evidence provided by the whistleblower the inspector general did not know the contents of
[1:12:24.200 --> 1:12:29.400]  the phone call at issue the inspector general found the whistleblower displayed arguable
[1:12:29.400 --> 1:12:35.320]  political bias against trump the department of justice investigated the complaint and determined
[1:12:35.320 --> 1:12:42.440]  no action was warranted the ukrainian president denies being pressured by president trump so once
[1:12:42.440 --> 1:12:49.480]  again this supposed scandal ends up being nothing like what we were told and once again the democrats
[1:12:49.480 --> 1:12:57.000]  their media mouthpieces and a cabal of leakers are ginning up a fake story with no regard to the
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  monumental damage they're causing to our public institutions and to trust in government and
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:09.720]  without acknowledging all the false stories they propagated in the past including countless allegations
[1:13:09.720 --> 1:13:17.000]  that trump campaign colluded with russia to hack the 2016 election we're supposed to forget about
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:25.160]  all those stories but believe this one in short what we have with this storyline is another
[1:13:25.160 --> 1:13:32.040]  still dossier i'll note here that in the democrats mania to overturn the 2016 elections
[1:13:32.040 --> 1:13:38.280]  everything they touch gets hopelessly politicized with the russia hoax it was our intelligence
[1:13:38.280 --> 1:13:43.800]  agencies which were turned into a political weapon to attack the president and now today
[1:13:44.440 --> 1:13:51.320]  the whistleblower process is the casualty until about a week ago the need to protect that process
[1:13:51.320 --> 1:13:56.920]  was the prime was a primary bipartisan concern of this committee but if the democrats were
[1:13:56.920 --> 1:14:02.680]  really concerned with defending that process they would have pursued this matter with a quiet sober
[1:14:03.240 --> 1:14:10.200]  inquiry as we do for all whistleblowers but that would have been useless for them they don't want
[1:14:10.200 --> 1:14:16.040]  answers they want a public spectacle and so we've been treated to an unending parade of
[1:14:16.040 --> 1:14:23.480]  press releases press conferences and fake news stories this hearing itself is another example
[1:14:23.480 --> 1:14:28.680]  whistleblower inquiry should not be held in public at all as our senate counterparts both
[1:14:28.680 --> 1:14:34.680]  democrats and republicans obviously understand their hearing with mr maguire is behind closed
[1:14:34.680 --> 1:14:41.960]  doors but again that only makes sense when your goal is to get information not to create a media
[1:14:41.960 --> 1:14:56.520]  frenzy the current hysteria has something else in common with the russia hoax back then they
[1:14:56.520 --> 1:15:01.080]  accused the trump campaign of colluding with russians when the democrats themselves were
[1:15:01.080 --> 1:15:07.560]  colluding with russians and preparing the still dossier today they accused the president of
[1:15:07.560 --> 1:15:13.800]  pressuring ukrainians to take actions that would help himself or hurt his political opponents
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:22.200]  and yet there are numerous examples of democrats doing the exact same thing ladies and gentlemen
[1:15:22.200 --> 1:15:27.160]  we are not watching the fourth time in history they try to impeach somebody we are watching
[1:15:27.160 --> 1:15:31.960]  any deep state could against our nation constitutional lawyer robert barnes is here

[1:20:25.320 --> 1:20:36.360]  the
[1:20:36.360 --> 1:20:41.320]  page bill clinton's going to be on with us give us his expert take i saw him on fox yesterday
[1:20:41.320 --> 1:20:46.680]  is he thinks the democrats don't have the nerve to actually carry out the house indictment in the
[1:20:46.680 --> 1:20:54.600]  senate trial and i tend to agree with him in the past but they're powerful corporate forces and foreign
[1:20:54.600 --> 1:20:59.320]  forces that are really threatening and blackmailing democrats as well as far as republicans
[1:20:59.320 --> 1:21:02.600]  that are getting threatened to take action that's why they're so desperate it's why they're so
[1:21:02.600 --> 1:21:09.880]  wild eyed impeachment has officially begun in the house they they've instructed all six
[1:21:09.880 --> 1:21:17.880]  committees just like with nixon to do this mitt romney advisor sits on board of directors of the
[1:21:17.880 --> 1:21:24.280]  company run by joe biden's son we're gonna be breaking that down with robert barnes right now
[1:21:24.280 --> 1:21:30.120]  but i'm categorizing this as the third coup attempt they admit they're trying to remove him
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:36.760]  it doesn't matter that the declassified transcript shows trump did nothing wrong
[1:21:36.760 --> 1:21:40.920]  uh they've said they don't care they're just getting the process going that they're going to try to
[1:21:40.920 --> 1:21:45.720]  remove him before the election which in any other time in history you know they they tried to get
[1:21:45.720 --> 1:21:50.680]  nixon after he got reelected you don't do this before it'll be seen as talk about election meddling
[1:21:51.240 --> 1:21:55.640]  barnes this is just max of total desperation what do you think well it's a combination of two things
[1:21:55.640 --> 1:21:59.880]  you have the democratic party establishment who if they were satisfied with their democratic candidates
[1:21:59.880 --> 1:22:04.520]  for president would not be pursuing this agenda at all but the other factors revealed in the article
[1:22:04.520 --> 1:22:10.280]  today by american thinker is that what trump stumbled onto in ukrainian corruption is in fact
[1:22:10.280 --> 1:22:15.000]  deep state corruption not just the democratic party establishment's role in that but you get into
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:22.520]  this and what you have is a key board member of the same company that was the board member company
[1:22:22.520 --> 1:22:26.760]  this gentleman right here of the same company that was funneling money to hunter biden and
[1:22:26.760 --> 1:22:32.520]  joe biden's family in ukraine uh this guy was one of the key board of directors and who is he
[1:22:32.520 --> 1:22:37.800]  he's a key romney national security advisor and has a long legacy of ties affiliations that
[1:22:37.800 --> 1:22:44.680]  associates listen to that wash the name call for oh exactly cofa block uh i mean former uh he was
[1:22:44.680 --> 1:22:50.520]  former vice chair of blackwater right i mean this guy has a long standing uh ties to the cia
[1:22:51.240 --> 1:22:57.400]  deeply embedded within the republican neocon political establishment and he was the actual
[1:22:57.400 --> 1:23:03.400]  also one of the board members of that company so what you had was uh joe biden was seeding a
[1:23:03.400 --> 1:23:09.000]  cash and laundering money out of the ukrainian political system through what looked looks now
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  like a deep state front operation and so what trump was going to be exposing with the help of the
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:20.040]  ukrainian president wasn't just democratic corruption of the biden family in the obama
[1:23:20.040 --> 1:23:26.360]  administration but was also deep state collusion and corruption and improper interference uh with
[1:23:26.360 --> 1:23:31.800]  a foreign government trying to impair its election being in bed with neo nazis as trump talks about
[1:23:31.800 --> 1:23:36.520]  in his uh transcript when the deep state read and reviewed this transcript and saw what trump was
[1:23:36.520 --> 1:23:41.480]  talking about this was a direct threat to their political power because in here he talks about
[1:23:41.480 --> 1:23:46.520]  hey i know that the former ambassador to your country was him was a bad person in bed with
[1:23:46.520 --> 1:23:51.720]  bad people what he's talking about is what oliver stone documented in the film of ukraine on fire
[1:23:51.720 --> 1:23:56.600]  which was that the u.s. government was in bed with actual neo nazis and those who have a long
[1:23:56.600 --> 1:24:01.720]  legacy of nazi and by the way we said that and i've been sued by georgetown for saying that
[1:24:01.720 --> 1:24:06.920]  the democrats funded nazis it's in oliver stone's hbo show oh exactly i mean it's documented in great
[1:24:06.920 --> 1:24:12.120]  detail in that movie in fact it's not even a publicly disputed controversy our biggest involvement
[1:24:12.120 --> 1:24:18.040]  with neo with actual nazis aside from operation paperclip and other activities was our our deeply
[1:24:18.040 --> 1:24:23.160]  embedded role with ukrainian nazis dating back to the 1940s and the reason i bring this up is
[1:24:23.160 --> 1:24:28.520]  it's central trump deserves a medal when you read this transcript absolutely he's going after nazis
[1:24:28.520 --> 1:24:33.240]  yes he says isn't it terrible biden's on tv bragging about crimes he committed exactly and then he
[1:24:33.240 --> 1:24:38.040]  moves on to say buy our weapons which is totally legal he should be doing right so so i mean this
[1:24:38.040 --> 1:24:42.680]  is crazy and then now they go well never mind that forget that we're still moving on they're trying
[1:24:42.680 --> 1:24:47.080]  to impeach him for doing his job they're trying to impeach him for actually doing what he was elected
[1:24:47.080 --> 1:24:51.000]  to do for cleaning up america oh it makes me like trump even more it's like every transcript
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:55.400]  that gets released he just it's awesome oh no doubt about it i mean this is a confirmation
[1:24:55.400 --> 1:24:59.720]  because what you had was zealinski trying to elicit from trump whether trump was sincere
[1:24:59.720 --> 1:25:05.320]  and he was sending cues and and using cue words to trigger certain conversations and discussions
[1:25:05.320 --> 1:25:10.280]  so like for example zealinski first brings up that he got rid of his ambassador to the us
[1:25:10.280 --> 1:25:14.440]  because he understood that that ambassador was actually part of the sort of deep-state collusion
[1:25:14.440 --> 1:25:18.760]  and corruption undermining democracy both in ukraine and the us and help people realize how
[1:25:18.760 --> 1:25:25.960]  bombshell this is the president just says wow do you see biden on tv saying he threatened to take
[1:25:25.960 --> 1:25:29.880]  a billion dollars away from you if you didn't fire a prosecutor and the under the last president
[1:25:29.880 --> 1:25:34.040]  and then he moves on because the guy's saying we are corrupt it's terrible to swamp comes like yeah
[1:25:34.040 --> 1:25:38.280]  i saw this i saw that and then he needs to be impeached for that it's like saying he's being
[1:25:38.280 --> 1:25:42.440]  impeached for brushing his teeth i mean really what they want to impeach him for is for challenging
[1:25:42.440 --> 1:25:47.080]  contesting deep state power exactly that's why they're so scared absolutely this is a deep state
[1:25:47.080 --> 1:25:51.880]  coup even more than it is a democratic party establishment attempt to undermine and overturn
[1:25:51.880 --> 1:25:57.000]  the 2016 exactly it's neoconsate trump just as much absolutely the reason why they're terrified the
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:00.920]  reason why this reached a state that didn't make sense once the transcript was released
[1:26:00.920 --> 1:26:05.640]  because the president doing his job is not a crime a president investigating democratic party crimes
[1:26:05.640 --> 1:26:09.960]  is not a crime these are actually doing what he's supposed to be doing what he was elected to do
[1:26:09.960 --> 1:26:14.680]  the reason why they're going nuts about this is because this would undermine and and reveal and
[1:26:14.680 --> 1:26:19.400]  unveil deep state corruption and collusion including with the democratic party including
[1:26:19.400 --> 1:26:22.920]  with foreign government and this is everything that i've harped on that you've harped on at least
[1:26:22.920 --> 1:26:27.080]  tranny hands harped on that roger stone harped on and we've written literally probably a hundred
[1:26:27.080 --> 1:26:31.640]  articles on this until i told the crews stop reporting on it a year ago no one cares well i
[1:26:31.640 --> 1:26:36.200]  guess it was a delayed action we've covered every facet of this and got in the intel of the white
[1:26:36.200 --> 1:26:41.400]  house we've gotten stuff to trump saying do something about this now they're acting like it's
[1:26:41.400 --> 1:26:47.000]  illegal to care about our government overthrowing ukraine and stealing billions of dollars for
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:52.040]  democrats and republicans trump deserves a freaking medal no doubt in fact this would reveal
[1:26:52.040 --> 1:26:56.760]  this would be like the late 1970s mk old to a frank church hearings in terms of the degree of
[1:26:56.760 --> 1:27:01.320]  corruption and collusion it would reveal and it would implicate high-ranking democrats it would
[1:27:01.320 --> 1:27:05.960]  implicate high-ranking political establishment figures it would implicate the obama administration
[1:27:05.960 --> 1:27:11.240]  but primarily and principally it would implicate the deep state it would expose deep state operatives
[1:27:11.240 --> 1:27:16.200]  it would expose xca spooks it would expose cia tide allies who are undermining foreign
[1:27:16.200 --> 1:27:19.960]  governments who are corrupting foreign governments and in the process undermining and corrupting
[1:27:19.960 --> 1:27:25.080]  our own government and this was the president saying he was committed and and verbalizing
[1:27:25.080 --> 1:27:30.200]  his commitment no matter where the investigation led and that's what terrified that's exactly what
[1:27:30.200 --> 1:27:35.000]  an anti-corrupt person would say is yes we're gonna fight corruption with you exactly and this is
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:41.560]  not only this this deep state coup part two the impeachment disguised and masked as nothing more
[1:27:41.560 --> 1:27:46.040]  than a deep state coup part two is really being directed at two people it's being directed at
[1:27:46.040 --> 1:27:50.040]  president trump so they're satisfied even if they don't get the full conviction in the senate
[1:27:50.040 --> 1:27:54.120]  they just want to terrify everybody within the administration to not going through with what
[1:27:54.120 --> 1:27:58.440]  president trump is talking about doing in the investigation into corruption and collusion of
[1:27:58.440 --> 1:28:02.360]  a deep state the democratic party elites and establishment number one and number two they
[1:28:02.360 --> 1:28:06.360]  want to scare and terrify the president of ukraine they want to show hey look what we can do to
[1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:10.920]  president of the united states when he talks about investigating our corruption and collusion
[1:28:10.920 --> 1:28:16.280]  involved in ukraine imagine what we can do to you and by the way info wars and zero hedge it turns
[1:28:16.280 --> 1:28:22.040]  out reporting this in 2014 yes oh exactly i mean this has been this is confirmation the entire
[1:28:22.040 --> 1:28:27.720]  pre-trump it is this goes this is the deep state operatives who've been acting independently and
[1:28:27.720 --> 1:28:32.520]  above the law and above the president that president trump was elected to clean up to change because
[1:28:32.520 --> 1:28:36.760]  american public was tired of these and was fatigued with these so let me ask you this what do you
[1:28:36.760 --> 1:28:42.040]  expect them to do next how serious is this and what should we the people do because this is just
[1:28:42.040 --> 1:28:46.520]  unbelievable they're trying to impeach trump for what biden did i think we're so dumb that they
[1:28:46.520 --> 1:28:50.360]  think of the whole media colludes against the people and trump that we're going to buy this i

[1:34:54.520 --> 1:35:00.440]  what you think about this situation and what we can do to the democrats is legal and lawful for
[1:35:00.440 --> 1:35:05.320]  all the lies they've been caught in and because we've lowered our attention spans and lowered our
[1:35:05.320 --> 1:35:08.920]  memories scientifically that's been done by television and smartphones and culture they're
[1:35:08.920 --> 1:35:13.560]  getting shorter and shorter it's like people are waking up every day with to a new hope so by the
[1:35:13.560 --> 1:35:17.800]  time that's proven to be a hoax they move to the next and again we followed suit on the young
[1:35:17.800 --> 1:35:21.480]  church for lies yesterday we're going to go ahead and follow some new suits we decided
[1:35:21.480 --> 1:35:26.120]  about a month from now we're going to follow some new ones that we'll tell you about next hour
[1:35:27.080 --> 1:35:32.280]  but but decided to warn them one more time today on air and officially send letters again to news
[1:35:32.280 --> 1:35:38.440]  court to the wall street journal in their publications all over the country they said i lost a lawsuit
[1:35:38.440 --> 1:35:43.320]  in sandy hook for writing a book attacking the children and people and i didn't ever do that i
[1:35:43.320 --> 1:35:47.480]  didn't write the book i'm not in the book and they said we don't care we're going to keep putting
[1:35:47.480 --> 1:35:52.440]  this in the front page of newspapers it's very damaging and we're just going to give them one
[1:35:52.440 --> 1:35:58.680]  more chance at dinner we decided we're suing young turks mother jones and this other democrat
[1:35:58.680 --> 1:36:03.160]  woman running for congress in massachusetts because she said i said kill the sandy hook kids and then
[1:36:03.160 --> 1:36:08.360]  when they put that out i got taken off roku where we were going to number one we're number one on
[1:36:08.360 --> 1:36:14.760]  cloud tv right now number one and so they literally have people go he's saying kill children and they
[1:36:14.760 --> 1:36:21.240]  take me off stuff and they go yay we got him so i don't want to have to sue you but i'm really suing
[1:36:21.240 --> 1:36:26.120]  these people and we're gonna send one more register letter more calls to news court say listen
[1:36:27.240 --> 1:36:32.040]  i didn't write this damn book and i didn't say this about these kids stop it but see they don't
[1:36:32.040 --> 1:36:35.800]  care they're on a mission to shut down their competition harbert barnes will talk about that
[1:36:35.800 --> 1:36:42.040]  next hour eight seven seven seven eight nine alex is the number barnes you're on fire as usual really
[1:36:42.040 --> 1:36:49.640]  knowledgeable on these subjects um how about the process of trying to impeach him gut level where
[1:36:49.640 --> 1:36:54.760]  you think this is going because i agree with you yesterday oh this is all bull it's going to fall
[1:36:54.760 --> 1:36:59.880]  apart his his ratings are going up but Pelosi and schumer go we don't care we're just going to open up
[1:36:59.880 --> 1:37:05.080]  all six committees and just turn out women that claim they're attacked and lawyers we indict well
[1:37:05.080 --> 1:37:09.720]  then make up stuff on trump anybody associated with him and and then and then this ukraine thing i
[1:37:09.720 --> 1:37:15.240]  mean they decided to go all out because he's really going after them hallelujah he's taking my advice
[1:37:15.240 --> 1:37:19.560]  the best defense is an offense but that means a real offense he's really trying to drain the
[1:37:19.560 --> 1:37:24.440]  damn swamp and i just i just can't believe we're in such an epic moment here well i mean what's
[1:37:24.440 --> 1:37:28.520]  made the political observers who looked at this initially and originally thought it did not make
[1:37:28.520 --> 1:37:33.240]  sense for the democrats to pursue impeachment given various polling and focus group surveys
[1:37:33.240 --> 1:37:39.400]  and shown back to 2017 that in fact uh impeachment was unpopular that impeachment would rally
[1:37:39.400 --> 1:37:44.200]  trump's base we're already seeing that massive fundraising that trump is able to do based on
[1:37:44.200 --> 1:37:48.600]  this so people were like why is this happening but now stories and news and intel is coming out
[1:37:48.600 --> 1:37:53.480]  that make clear that this is really a deep state operation this is a deep state demanding their
[1:37:53.480 --> 1:37:59.640]  democratic party elites and uh and allies pursue isn't the regular snot knows democrat methods
[1:37:59.640 --> 1:38:05.640]  nancy and aoc this is the real teeth of the deep states now traitors democrats is their front now
[1:38:05.640 --> 1:38:10.600]  now it's daddy you know it's just a little tongue it puts out the big spiders coming out
[1:38:10.600 --> 1:38:15.080]  precisely that's what this is all about that's why today on predicted a political betting market
[1:38:15.080 --> 1:38:21.240]  there's now a 60 chance according to the political gamblers that impeachment will occur that president
[1:38:21.240 --> 1:38:25.720]  trump will be impeached according to political gamblers and betters and estimators and that's
[1:38:25.720 --> 1:38:31.000]  because people are realizing this is a deep state operation and that this is an intel apparatus
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:35.080]  operation going back to chuck tumor statement that the intelligence agencies would continue to wage
[1:38:35.080 --> 1:38:40.680]  war on trump if he tried to expose the corruption of the obama administrations and its infiltration
[1:38:40.680 --> 1:38:46.440]  of our law enforcement stat uh apparatus our hierarchy our intelligence apparatus and the
[1:38:46.440 --> 1:38:51.080]  rest so that's what this is all about this is about if he exposed what hunter biden was doing
[1:38:51.080 --> 1:38:55.400]  hunter biden was like clinton in the 90s was embedded with deep state operatives it's the
[1:38:55.400 --> 1:39:00.120]  reason why the star investigation never really went anywhere focused on monica lawinsky and not
[1:39:00.120 --> 1:39:05.720]  the deep corruption in arkansas because trump tied that deep corruption because clinton tied
[1:39:05.720 --> 1:39:10.440]  that deep corruption to the deep state operatives here because what trump was just trying to do
[1:39:10.440 --> 1:39:14.680]  was protect and do his job of of exposing corruption but in the process he would be
[1:39:14.680 --> 1:39:18.520]  exposing deep state corruption deep state collusion with foreign government and just by
[1:39:18.520 --> 1:39:23.320]  showing ahead of state yes i know about how the neo nazis overthrew your government with obama
[1:39:23.320 --> 1:39:28.600]  yes i know about uh hunter biden and his corruption when the deep state as you said yesterday saw
[1:39:28.600 --> 1:39:34.120]  that they literally took a giant dump in their drawers absolutely and you look at the whistleblower
[1:39:34.120 --> 1:39:38.680]  complaints coming out today and people who are looking at it are saying this is a feels like a
[1:39:38.680 --> 1:39:43.880]  prefabricated hit job this is a it looks like a lawyer prepared it it looks like it's all based
[1:39:43.880 --> 1:39:49.240]  on third party information which means this person did not firsthand receive or review or hear any of
[1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:53.160]  this oh they missed a total third party it's just a made-up thing well that means that there's only
[1:39:53.160 --> 1:39:58.120]  one uh who is a third party who has access to a wide range of information who is a third party
[1:39:58.120 --> 1:40:03.160]  all these former intelligence heads that kept the security clerks exactly it's a deep state hit it
[1:40:03.160 --> 1:40:08.360]  shows that this was probably brennan or clapper themselves if they could be involved at any level
[1:40:08.360 --> 1:40:12.440]  or could be coming for a god's sake if somebody connected to it it's somebody and then trump can't
[1:40:12.440 --> 1:40:16.120]  prosecute call me because he's the whistleblower exactly i mean there's stories today that the
[1:40:16.120 --> 1:40:20.120]  whistleblower has i don't disturbance in the force the last time i felt it was in the presence of
[1:40:20.120 --> 1:40:25.320]  my old master exactly i mean it's the real star wars finale movie coming out now the the emperor
[1:40:25.320 --> 1:40:30.040]  is back and the emperor is the deep state and the deep state wants to take over uh its policies
[1:40:30.040 --> 1:40:33.720]  around the world and doesn't want them to be elected president to be able to independently run
[1:40:33.720 --> 1:40:37.640]  his own country that he was elected to run and that's what this is really about and the question is
[1:40:37.640 --> 1:40:42.600]  are these loons really going to do it i mean uh because well i think they have to their their
[1:40:42.600 --> 1:40:47.240]  loyalties as as schumer said he does whatever the intelligence apparatus tells him to do because
[1:40:47.240 --> 1:40:51.560]  he's terrified of what they would do to him if in fact he did anything different so that's how
[1:40:51.560 --> 1:40:55.640]  they're gonna that's the reason why polosi who knows this will be damaging to the democratic
[1:40:55.640 --> 1:41:00.360]  party congressional prospects in 2020 is moving forward and they will continue to move forward
[1:41:00.360 --> 1:41:05.080]  because this is a deep state demand a deep state demand without robert moeller to be their hatchet
[1:41:05.080 --> 1:41:10.680]  man inside the administration anymore they now need congress to substitute for that that's the
[1:41:10.680 --> 1:41:15.320]  reason why moeller stepped down and bar was able to force him out after the elections is a deep state
[1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:19.640]  knew they had democratic allies in the house that could do their bidding for them and that's
[1:41:19.640 --> 1:41:24.280]  precisely what's happening and that's why they're going to put maximum pressure on republican senators
[1:41:24.280 --> 1:41:29.640]  and that's why the president faces real risky or real exposure not because he did anything wrong
[1:41:29.640 --> 1:41:34.680]  but because what he did was was the right thing to do the more right he did something
[1:41:34.680 --> 1:41:38.760]  the more likely he was going to be the more he showed he was a boy scout exactly i mean this is
[1:41:38.760 --> 1:41:43.640]  like people forget nixon wasn't taken out for the bad things he did nixon was taken out because he
[1:41:43.640 --> 1:41:48.600]  decided to not allow the deep state to continue to run the fbi after hoover died he passed over
[1:41:48.600 --> 1:41:53.480]  mark felt and it was mark felt who was the actual quote unquote deep throat and mark felt was the
[1:41:53.480 --> 1:41:58.840]  ran co-intel pro was a criminal had engaged in criminal activities for 30 years was the deep
[1:41:58.840 --> 1:42:04.040]  state operative within the fbi and because nixon took them out that's when mark felt made sure he
[1:42:04.040 --> 1:42:09.000]  took nixon out and so the same thing is happening now except trump has done nothing wrong ever in
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:12.920]  any of this in fact let's be clear you see why robert barnes is awesome because i have no all
[1:42:12.920 --> 1:42:17.560]  this stuff but he can pull it together better and quicker than i can and the guy even talks more than
[1:42:17.560 --> 1:42:22.280]  i do he's awesome when we come back though i want listeners to have a chance to speak here and on a
[1:42:22.280 --> 1:42:27.560]  place where key clubs haven't gotten to yet that'll just gonna blow you away literally but first i want
[1:42:27.560 --> 1:42:32.520]  to explain something i told you trump was gonna get elected i could feel it i could see it they're
[1:42:32.520 --> 1:42:36.920]  going to try to impeach him and i think they've got a good shot at it but let me explain something
[1:42:37.560 --> 1:42:43.000]  what comes after that's going to destroy them so god word some mysterious ways but some rough
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:47.400]  times are ahead ladies and gentlemen so get ready i told everybody yesterday you better take this
[1:42:47.400 --> 1:42:53.720]  serious and let me tell you because it's hidden the democrats the snot knows us this is the real

[1:47:00.200 --> 1:47:02.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:02.840 --> 1:47:17.400]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[1:47:21.160 --> 1:47:25.480]  ladies and gentlemen this is it the deep states already tried to remove trump twice they wanted
[1:47:25.480 --> 1:47:30.280]  to use democrat puppets now they're really going for him even though it doesn't make political
[1:47:30.280 --> 1:47:35.080]  sense for the democrats because it's bigger than that it's about the new world order constitutional
[1:47:35.080 --> 1:47:39.480]  robert barnes constitutional lawyer robert barnes break it down so what's happening is the deep
[1:47:39.480 --> 1:47:43.480]  state operatives are the ones driving the impeachment effort this is why the political
[1:47:43.480 --> 1:47:47.880]  gamblers in the political betting markets are saying now that trump will be impeached that's
[1:47:47.880 --> 1:47:52.280]  what's happening that trump will be impeached and will go to the senate for a trial it's because
[1:47:52.280 --> 1:47:57.560]  what trump is exposing is deep state corruption and deep state collusion and using the ukrainian
[1:47:57.560 --> 1:48:01.640]  government that they were the hunter biden and the biden family was in bed with deep state
[1:48:01.640 --> 1:48:06.200]  operatives that are still acting within the intelligence community connected to mit romney
[1:48:06.200 --> 1:48:11.240]  the bushes all of them the entire neocon political establishment so the neocons the deep state the
[1:48:11.240 --> 1:48:16.840]  shadow government with the democrats making their move in an election year this is incredible but
[1:48:16.840 --> 1:48:23.480]  trump's done nothing wrong he's got the people on his side and they think they can repeat 1974 again
[1:48:23.480 --> 1:48:28.920]  with richard nixon this is a different world and the people are awake and they know you put all
[1:48:28.920 --> 1:48:33.800]  these ingredients together it is explosive and the deep state is really overplaying their hand
[1:48:33.800 --> 1:48:39.080]  allying themselves with communist china and others in america's darkest hour uh they may
[1:48:39.080 --> 1:48:43.880]  end up winning the battle against trump but they will lose the war this is going to be a
[1:48:43.880 --> 1:48:48.600]  pyrrhic victory for them no doubt any the key is the president still has his backers and supporters
[1:48:48.600 --> 1:48:52.920]  they are the ultimate firewall they are the ultimate protection they are the ultimate castle
[1:48:52.920 --> 1:48:58.360]  wall against these deep state invaders against our democratic institutions and so he depends on
[1:48:58.360 --> 1:49:02.760]  the audience depends on the american people to continue to get the voice out the news out the
[1:49:02.760 --> 1:49:07.240]  information out but this also explains the degree of censorship and suppression that's taken place
[1:49:07.240 --> 1:49:11.880]  over the last two years they're trying to make it impossible for the president to rally his own
[1:49:11.880 --> 1:49:15.480]  audience and now they're taking their shot now they're taking they want the president cut off
[1:49:15.480 --> 1:49:21.160]  from his people they want them cut off from him and now they're making their move you can feel it
[1:49:21.160 --> 1:49:25.560]  you can see it and you saw him in that un speech against the new world order against globalism
[1:49:25.560 --> 1:49:30.120]  against socialism against communism against gun control against the attack on our children
[1:49:30.120 --> 1:49:34.760]  throw down the gauntlet against the chikoms stealing our our intellectual property he is
[1:49:34.760 --> 1:49:41.400]  going to be even stronger now as he fights for his life he's the real deal he really stood in
[1:49:41.400 --> 1:49:46.680]  for us he really stepped into the arena the air to the lungs of the trump revolution is the
[1:49:46.680 --> 1:49:51.480]  info wars audience is the american people is the trump base and that is why they have worked
[1:49:51.480 --> 1:49:56.520]  so hard to try to isolate and separate trump from his base both hearing his base and being able to
[1:49:56.520 --> 1:50:00.600]  reach his base with all the censorship and suppression that took on with big tech companies
[1:50:00.600 --> 1:50:05.800]  that have longstanding deep alliances and make no mistake they were built by the shadow government
[1:50:05.800 --> 1:50:10.200]  by the deep state right make no mistake they get trump out there's going to be a reign of terror
[1:50:10.200 --> 1:50:17.720]  against nunez against paul against jordan against us and a lot of people are going to cut bait and
[1:50:17.720 --> 1:50:23.240]  roll over i'm not rolling over we're winning we we started this fight we got trump in we haven't
[1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:31.160]  even begun to fight we will never surrender never the american freedom and american liberty depends
[1:50:31.160 --> 1:50:36.600]  on the american public rallying to the president's side now i feel good this is a deep fight we're
[1:50:36.600 --> 1:50:41.080]  making them come out and pull something super dangerous and they're willing to take the biggest
[1:50:41.080 --> 1:50:47.240]  possible risk to put this high profile in peter case and publicly on a high profile simply to
[1:50:47.240 --> 1:50:51.640]  prevent the president from exposing deep state corruption collusion with the democratic party
[1:50:51.640 --> 1:50:55.880]  political establishment and elites particularly it is a related to ukraine and these ukrainian
[1:50:55.880 --> 1:51:00.120]  money laundering operations and trafficking operations and it's just incredible that they're
[1:51:00.120 --> 1:51:05.400]  doing this out of pure desperation but the planets are aligned on both sides this is the unstoppable
[1:51:05.400 --> 1:51:11.320]  force meets the immovable object i mean this is going to be explosive no doubt the war is on the
[1:51:11.320 --> 1:51:16.120]  war is on they got their false flags are lined up just watch your six folks this is it this is it
[1:51:16.120 --> 1:51:20.840]  boys all right let's go to these clips here's adam shift the head of the committee deceives
[1:51:20.840 --> 1:51:25.480]  congress about whistleblower complaint it's called out on it and then admits he was lying
[1:51:25.480 --> 1:51:31.960]  but tries to make a joke out of it what a sack of garbage here it is is the essence of what
[1:51:31.960 --> 1:51:39.000]  the president communicates we've been very good to your country very good no other country has
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:45.640]  done as much as we have but you know what i don't see much reciprocity here i hear what you want
[1:51:46.280 --> 1:51:52.360]  i have a favor i want from you though and i'm going to say this only seven times so you better
[1:51:52.360 --> 1:51:59.400]  listen good i want you to make up dirt on my political opponent understand lots of it on this
[1:51:59.400 --> 1:52:03.880]  and on that i'm going to put you in touch with people not just any people i'm going to put you
[1:52:03.880 --> 1:52:09.240]  in touch with attorney general the united states my attorney general bill bar he's got the whole weight
[1:52:10.200 --> 1:52:16.360]  of the american law enforcement behind him and i'm going to put you in touch with rudy you're
[1:52:16.360 --> 1:52:22.120]  going to love him trust me you know what i'm asking and so i'm only going to say this a few more times
[1:52:22.120 --> 1:52:30.120]  in a few more ways and by the way don't call me again i'll call you when you've done what i asked
[1:52:31.480 --> 1:52:35.800]  this is fabricated in some in character what the president was trying to communicate
[1:52:37.400 --> 1:52:41.160]  with the president of ukraine it would be funny if it wasn't such a graphic betrayal
[1:52:41.720 --> 1:52:47.960]  of the president's oath of office but as it does represent a real betrayal there's nothing the
[1:52:47.960 --> 1:52:54.840]  president says here that is an america's interest after all it is instead the most consequential
[1:52:55.720 --> 1:52:59.240]  now matt who does a really great job of getting these clubs together
[1:53:01.160 --> 1:53:03.640]  before the show he said will you please just leave with this
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:08.040]  and i said yeah i will but then i saw the newness club and i had to play that but i
[1:53:08.040 --> 1:53:13.560]  should have started the whole show out with that i mean the bombshell nature of him making up a fake
[1:53:13.560 --> 1:53:18.680]  transcript making it sound like the colloquial isms of the nomenclature of trump saying that's
[1:53:18.680 --> 1:53:24.280]  what he said and then later minutes later the republicans get to respond and say you just lied
[1:53:24.280 --> 1:53:29.720]  and then he sweeps under the rug he's a freaking criminal man he runs the committee giving the
[1:53:29.720 --> 1:53:36.440]  world fake quotes that they're putting on the news right now i mean this is a level of just
[1:53:36.440 --> 1:53:41.960]  flagrant evil talk about impeaching he needs to be impeached bars we're going to play when he
[1:53:41.960 --> 1:53:47.640]  backtracks in a moment like the sniveling rat he is but what the hell do you call that libel and
[1:53:47.640 --> 1:53:51.320]  lies that he's allowed to get away with because he's saying them inside the halls of congress
[1:53:51.320 --> 1:53:55.800]  and if elizabeth warren is able to get away with it in the covington case she's saying politicians
[1:53:55.800 --> 1:54:00.520]  should do be able to do what shift just did anywhere anytime anyplace even outside the halls
[1:54:00.520 --> 1:54:05.240]  of congress even involving matters not before congress and be able to lie and libel anywhere
[1:54:05.240 --> 1:54:10.680]  anybody anywhere and then as long as the media is repeating a politician's lies and libels the
[1:54:10.680 --> 1:54:15.400]  media itself can't be held responsible or libel absolutely let's go ahead now and play when he
[1:54:15.400 --> 1:54:20.840]  gets called on at a few minutes later of course the news won't carry that here it is my summary of
[1:54:20.840 --> 1:54:26.440]  the president's call was meant to be at least part in parody the fact that that's not clear is a
[1:54:26.440 --> 1:54:34.200]  separate problem in and of itself of course the president never said um if i uh if you don't understand
[1:54:34.200 --> 1:54:40.200]  me i'm gonna say seven more times my point is that's the message that the ukraine president was
[1:54:40.200 --> 1:54:46.280]  receiving in not so many words um look at how disingenuous shifts eyes are he just contradicted
[1:54:46.280 --> 1:54:50.280]  himself he said oh i was really doing a parody and by the way guys you did great i'm always telling
[1:54:50.280 --> 1:54:54.360]  you shorter clubs but in that case find it later let's do it long i want to play the congressman
[1:54:54.360 --> 1:54:58.040]  calling him out and then he backs off but i mean the whole thing was fake quotes but then he tries
[1:54:58.040 --> 1:55:03.880]  to act like when he backs off only part of it was fake well the guy is a damn liar to our face
[1:55:03.880 --> 1:55:09.960]  and he's trying to remove our great president and this is outrageous listeners should be going to
[1:55:09.960 --> 1:55:17.160]  dc peacefully and lawfully to mob his office that guy is a disgrace well what he did there is he
[1:55:17.160 --> 1:55:21.560]  first he starts out with a lot of lies and libel he gets exposed for those lies and libels and then
[1:55:21.560 --> 1:55:26.680]  he says oh i was just doing a parody which makes no sense why is he doing a parody as the house
[1:55:26.680 --> 1:55:30.920]  intelligence committee chairman at his beginning opening statements there that doesn't make any
[1:55:30.920 --> 1:55:35.640]  sense and then he contradicts himself again and he says oh actually it wasn't really a parody this
[1:55:35.640 --> 1:55:39.640]  is how the ukrainian president would have interpreted it knowing ukrain president by the way
[1:55:39.640 --> 1:55:45.000]  what's up with his eyes did you see how he how demented those bug eyes those that all these guys
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:49.480]  look weird i mean these these people that have this habit of lying and and deceit in public and
[1:55:49.480 --> 1:55:53.480]  none of them can talk either have you noticed polosi sounds like she's got a mouthful of marble
[1:55:53.480 --> 1:55:58.520]  so does biden well the i mean that they don't have clinton's ability to lie on command and lie on
[1:55:58.520 --> 1:56:02.680]  demand they don't have that that that capacity they these are the mid-tier politicians on the
[1:56:02.680 --> 1:56:07.160]  democratic side we're going to break i promise we're going to your calls bob bar's popping up for
[1:56:07.160 --> 1:56:11.560]  two segments but we're going to get to all your calls we'll take some of the next segment and my
[1:56:11.560 --> 1:56:17.400]  head is just i mean if america doesn't reject this if we're unable to defeat this it's because we
[1:56:17.400 --> 1:56:21.880]  killed 60 million babies and we deserve it and i want to beat these people i've got four children
[1:56:21.880 --> 1:56:25.960]  and i want to turn it around but you know come on my hat's off to the new world order i mean you
[1:56:25.960 --> 1:56:30.120]  guys have really screwed this country up i mean it's like newness says he goes man i got to hand
[1:56:30.120 --> 1:56:34.280]  it to you this level of bs newness could hardly for a few minutes yeah he couldn't talk he would
[1:56:34.280 --> 1:56:40.840]  just kind of go uh uh what the hell i mean this is just a gigantic hoax oh completely i mean this
[1:56:40.840 --> 1:56:44.280]  is something that newness never did when he was running the committee chairman whatsoever he never
[1:56:44.280 --> 1:56:48.840]  did these kind of lies and liabilities and started off a committee hearing where he completely fabricated
[1:56:48.840 --> 1:56:53.240]  a transcript that doesn't exist because the transcript directly contradicts in fact there's
[1:56:53.240 --> 1:57:00.360]  your headline chairman of the intelligent of the house intelligence committee fabricates fake
[1:57:00.360 --> 1:57:05.800]  trump transcript to the world and then it's nothing now because they haven't gotten in trouble
[1:57:05.800 --> 1:57:10.520]  so they're just quadruple and quadruple and then it's just it's exponential lie universe it's a
[1:57:10.520 --> 1:57:15.960]  nazi style lie scale it's lying on such a scale that the lies so big nobody will actually it's
[1:57:15.960 --> 1:57:19.720]  like hitler said you're gonna tell a tell a huge right because the bigger you tell it the more
[1:57:19.720 --> 1:57:23.160]  believed it's like i saw a lot in this monster he was flying a spaceship this morning and he was eating
[1:57:23.160 --> 1:57:28.440]  a little and just it just sounds like yeah it's over the top that people believe it must be true
[1:57:28.440 --> 1:57:31.080]  because it's over but then when the democrats are talking to their constituents they're like
[1:57:31.080 --> 1:57:37.240]  we piss on america we hate the babies we love schycombe uh please spread the word about the

[2:00:17.640 --> 2:00:21.960]  we're going to detail briefly the history of impeachment some and what it really means
[2:00:21.960 --> 2:00:27.000]  versus removal by the senate no one's ever actually been removed but right now we're
[2:00:27.000 --> 2:00:33.400]  taking some of your calls ahead of my bar popping in and continue with calls let's go ahead and talk

[2:00:38.040 --> 2:00:45.880]  hi alex hi mr barnes uh i i i don't know if this is constitutional if you could do this but
[2:00:46.760 --> 2:00:54.040]  could we be proactive in other words mcconnell uh president trump maybe some of the key
[2:00:54.040 --> 2:00:59.240]  congressional people they asked for time on national news they get they get on the air
[2:00:59.240 --> 2:01:03.720]  they lay out the fact that we're under attack by the chinese the democrats have been taken over
[2:01:03.720 --> 2:01:08.200]  by the chinese and we're going to nip this impeachment right in the bud mcconnell's going
[2:01:08.200 --> 2:01:16.280]  to call for a trial vote before the the papers are sent over from the house before they have
[2:01:16.280 --> 2:01:22.840]  a chance to start pressuring these senators boom he's found not guilty and then mcconnell just says
[2:01:22.840 --> 2:01:28.040]  anything you say is going to be anything you send over is going to be covered by this resolution
[2:01:28.040 --> 2:01:33.720]  he's the commander-in-chief he's got the full support of the senate and we're going to authorize
[2:01:33.720 --> 2:01:40.360]  him to use extraordinary majors to start sending us marshals in and arresting these people for
[2:01:40.360 --> 2:01:44.920]  treason well i've got to say this i'm not an authoritarian but it's not authoritarianism
[2:01:44.920 --> 2:01:50.040]  when foreign governments in a combine a combination of evil elements is openly trying to overthrow
[2:01:50.040 --> 2:01:55.720]  your country spy on everyone silence the people and then derail the economy which the democrats
[2:01:55.720 --> 2:01:59.960]  and the deep state admit they're doing so we are entering the phase where lincoln started having to
[2:01:59.960 --> 2:02:04.120]  arrest people i mean i i mean we just really are or we're just gonna let the tricombs of the deep
[2:02:04.120 --> 2:02:08.840]  state run us into the ground well and it's useful to remember when lincoln did try to clean up
[2:02:08.840 --> 2:02:13.640]  government and try to create a really new government after the end of the civil war he was taken out
[2:02:13.640 --> 2:02:17.000]  they tried to take out andrew johnson that night they tried to the secretary of war tried to take
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:21.640]  over i mean the the so that's a lot that's another impeachment when this all went down exactly i mean
[2:02:21.640 --> 2:02:26.280]  the all those efforts where they first tried to assassinate andrew johnson before they tried to
[2:02:26.280 --> 2:02:31.640]  impeach andrew johnson so the people forget that that night there were three attempts a boost attempt
[2:02:31.640 --> 2:02:36.920]  booth was just the tip of the spear of a ace of a secretary of war was the likely person that
[2:02:36.920 --> 2:02:41.000]  his historians target they're trying to get everybody absolutely and the secretary of war
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:43.880]  would have become president because they were they were going to take out the top three people
[2:02:43.880 --> 2:02:47.240]  and the secretary of war was next in line so there that's where there are multiple assassination
[2:02:47.240 --> 2:02:51.240]  efforts that they that historians cover up and folks we're now in that zone so the caller
[2:02:51.240 --> 2:02:56.760]  we're not being hysterical here we are already facing foreign powers overthrowing the country so
[2:02:57.400 --> 2:03:01.160]  unfortunately they've brought this climate absolutely there's a reason why political
[2:03:01.160 --> 2:03:05.240]  betting markets are today saying that it is more likely than not that president trump
[2:03:05.240 --> 2:03:09.720]  will be impeached and face a removal trial because there's an establishment alignment
[2:03:09.720 --> 2:03:14.040]  exactly it's that they people realize now with the disclosure of the whistleblower report
[2:03:14.040 --> 2:03:18.040]  and the disclosure of who hunter biden was serving with on that board in the ukrainian
[2:03:18.040 --> 2:03:22.680]  company receiving that laundered cash that it was mostly a deep state front group for
[2:03:22.680 --> 2:03:27.560]  politically corrupting the and the trump isn't going to sell out to him exactly and we're kicking
[2:03:27.560 --> 2:03:35.400]  his ass and they're just pissed sad you see other points uh no i i just think that we need to be
[2:03:35.400 --> 2:03:41.320]  proactive and i think the president needs to execute the full powers of his office and he
[2:03:41.320 --> 2:03:46.200]  needs to be backed up by mcconnell and possibly the supreme court and he needs to just lay out
[2:03:46.200 --> 2:03:51.720]  what what is going on that we are under attack by the communist chinese that they are directing
[2:03:51.720 --> 2:03:57.400]  this they are and that our government has been infiltrated they're bragging about they're funding
[2:03:57.400 --> 2:04:02.040]  hollywood race war films of this public well it's time for trump to issue a paul revere call to his
[2:04:02.040 --> 2:04:07.320]  followers to to hear the call and to uh galley up in order to defeat this deep state coup number
[2:04:07.320 --> 2:04:11.480]  three no i agree everybody needs to take an emergency vacation in congress i mean i go to
[2:04:11.480 --> 2:04:16.280]  congress all the time i can front the head of google had a facebook to their face and it's all over
[2:04:16.280 --> 2:04:21.000]  the news and like no one's there and everyone grovels around them go down there as citizens be

[2:04:31.800 --> 2:04:36.440]  a complete fabrication and he needs to be sanctioned for that oh absolutely what he did was false
[2:04:36.440 --> 2:04:40.680]  wait what he did was a violation of congressional rules what he did is far worse than what he got
[2:04:40.680 --> 2:04:45.480]  newt is well we got we got bob bar that started the impeachment on clinton uh here with us he can
[2:04:45.480 --> 2:04:49.480]  lay all this out for us perfectly on the other side and he was in the cia and tells about the deep

[2:06:09.320 --> 2:06:21.560]  front lines of the info well former congressman bob bar ride shotgun myself alex jones and
[2:06:21.560 --> 2:06:28.200]  robert barnes constitutional lawyer liberty guard dot org bob bar dot org uh the good conservative
[2:06:28.200 --> 2:06:31.960]  member of congress from george's who helped get the impeachment bill clinton kicked off i'm not
[2:06:31.960 --> 2:06:37.000]  going to go over all of his background but he's in the cia as well awarded his law degree from
[2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:40.680]  george any university master's degree from george washington university and bachelor degree from
[2:06:40.680 --> 2:06:45.400]  university of southern telephoria and he heads up a bunch of news and publications and more the
[2:06:45.400 --> 2:06:49.080]  directors the national rifle association i mean you just can't get into it all here
[2:06:49.080 --> 2:06:56.040]  rides for town hall dot com bob bar obviously uh is an expert on impeachment like no other
[2:06:56.040 --> 2:07:01.320]  so how does impeachment work obviously uh you know that's the indictment i guess in the in the house
[2:07:01.320 --> 2:07:06.680]  and then i guess the senate would remove i see a lot of the neocon deep state aligned with the
[2:07:06.680 --> 2:07:14.120]  democrats when removed from we've seen nothing in this unclassified transcript uh we've got
[2:07:14.120 --> 2:07:18.280]  another third party whistleblower wasn't even there we've got the head of the committee and
[2:07:18.840 --> 2:07:23.880]  shift reading fake transcripts later and being called out on it and saying well no one thought
[2:07:23.880 --> 2:07:29.960]  that was really real i mean i'm seeing desperation insanity bob bar thanks for joining us what would
[2:07:29.960 --> 2:07:35.480]  you call the climate we're in right now i would call the climate that we're in right now uh a
[2:07:35.480 --> 2:07:42.600]  dramatic example of climate change to be honest with you if you look back alex uh when you look
[2:07:42.600 --> 2:07:49.160]  at the impeachment effort in which we engaged back in 1998 against president clinton it was very
[2:07:49.160 --> 2:07:56.120]  focused it was very professional it was very fact-based and what we came up with after extensive
[2:07:56.120 --> 2:08:03.080]  hearings in the judiciary committee were very specific impeachful offenses that exhibited
[2:08:03.080 --> 2:08:09.720]  serious violations of federal laws by a sitting president we didn't do what this congress now
[2:08:09.720 --> 2:08:14.680]  is doing and that is just throwing everything that they can think of up on the wall seeing
[2:08:14.680 --> 2:08:21.160]  what sticks and then claiming it's an impeachable offense it is a disservice not just to the country
[2:08:21.160 --> 2:08:29.160]  but our founding fathers alex man it's really distressing and expanding on that we we literally
[2:08:29.160 --> 2:08:34.760]  see Pelosi and her impeachment announcement they say it doesn't matter there's nothing there
[2:08:35.320 --> 2:08:42.120]  we'll just continue on we'll have six committees this is a literal convening six committees to witch
[2:08:42.120 --> 2:08:48.520]  hunt well it's very similar to of course what she said a number of years ago with regard to the
[2:08:48.520 --> 2:08:53.640]  healthcare plan uh well let's pass it and then we'll see what's in it now that's what they're
[2:08:53.640 --> 2:08:58.920]  trying to do here well let's impeach then we'll see what basis there might be for it even in
[2:08:58.920 --> 2:09:05.160]  Pelosi's announcement a couple of days ago though alex uh they can't quite get it right
[2:09:05.960 --> 2:09:12.760]  the speaker says well we're going to have a an impeachment inquiry well an impeachment inquiry
[2:09:12.760 --> 2:09:19.480]  as you know and as we hand how we handle it back in 1998 is a formal document called an
[2:09:19.480 --> 2:09:26.680]  inquiry of impeachment it is filed in the house as an open resolution it is voted on and then that
[2:09:26.680 --> 2:09:34.920]  sets the parameters for an impeachment process inquiring in the judiciary committee so they
[2:09:34.920 --> 2:09:40.040]  haven't done that they just keep calling these things an impeachment inquiry or an impeachment
[2:09:40.040 --> 2:09:46.040]  investigation or whatnot but they don't have the guts to even do what they're supposed to be doing
[2:09:48.600 --> 2:09:55.160]  I know you're the expert and and are right about that but what about the fact that we see some
[2:09:55.160 --> 2:10:00.920]  republicans coming out even encouraging this uh I mean it's made Trump's approval writing go up
[2:10:00.920 --> 2:10:05.720]  but they really do appear to think that they're going to get the ball rolling somehow wound the
[2:10:05.720 --> 2:10:11.480]  president using the term impeachment and then remove him well you're always going to have some
[2:10:11.480 --> 2:10:17.480]  of those people in the republican party uh it's unfortunate but we do uh we even have some uh
[2:10:17.480 --> 2:10:23.720]  back in the 1998 uh impeachment inquiry and impeachment process in the house we had some
[2:10:23.720 --> 2:10:29.960]  um squishy republicans who were wringing their hands I'm thinking well maybe we shouldn't go
[2:10:29.960 --> 2:10:35.240]  forward with the impeachment of quentin well maybe if he just apologizes you know we'll all
[2:10:35.240 --> 2:10:40.680]  forgive and forget and go home so you're always going to have a few of those we have mit romney
[2:10:40.680 --> 2:10:47.160]  out there but I I truly believe that the vast majority of republicans and indeed the vast
[2:10:47.160 --> 2:10:52.040]  majority of the american people are going to look at all of this for what it is simply the
[2:10:52.040 --> 2:10:58.840]  democratic party like the boy in the old acep stable just falling wolf all the time and people
[2:10:58.840 --> 2:11:03.480]  are going to get tired of it which does not mean that they will not actually take a vote from
[2:11:03.480 --> 2:11:10.840]  people and they could very well but the term and the process itself now alex has become so
[2:11:10.840 --> 2:11:17.160]  political it doesn't have the meaning or as they say in washington the gravitas that it really should
[2:11:17.160 --> 2:11:22.840]  it bob bar of course ran the impeachment against bill clinton and we had clear cut
[2:11:23.720 --> 2:11:29.240]  things there but we've never had a president actually removed nixon was driven from our
[2:11:29.240 --> 2:11:35.080]  office obviously we've had cases where the house uh again basically in dites but then the senate
[2:11:35.080 --> 2:11:40.920]  doesn't remove uh what would that look like though because they're not giving up uh and they just
[2:11:40.920 --> 2:11:45.000]  keep pushing obviously somewhere in the future they think they're going to find something that
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:50.600]  will get them to vote something there but uh you're right coming in and then misfiring
[2:11:51.400 --> 2:11:54.840]  lying about what's in memos i don't know if you saw the chairman of the committee shift
[2:11:54.840 --> 2:11:59.640]  make up what was in the memo and read from a fake memo and then only later admit it was fake i mean
[2:11:59.640 --> 2:12:04.680]  this just seems like total insane mental illness and quite frankly it's very frightening to me
[2:12:04.680 --> 2:12:08.520]  because i've never seen government act like this even in third world countries a lot of times
[2:12:08.520 --> 2:12:16.680]  uh i have not either uh what we've seen both in the shift committee and the judiciary committee
[2:12:16.680 --> 2:12:22.440]  under uh chairman nadler for example a couple of weeks ago when the judiciary committee passed
[2:12:22.440 --> 2:12:29.720]  a resolution beginning an inquiry or an investigation or whatever they called it at the time uh that
[2:12:29.720 --> 2:12:35.240]  resolution if you look at it carefully violates house rules it isn't even consistent with the
[2:12:35.240 --> 2:12:42.200]  rules of the house so neither of these committees nor any of the other committees really know what
[2:12:42.200 --> 2:12:47.320]  they're doing or maybe they do and they do it anyway breaking the rules of the house for example
[2:12:48.120 --> 2:12:55.240]  but if there's no legitimate resemblance whatsoever to a an impeachable offense
[2:12:56.520 --> 2:13:03.160]  violations of law i think for heaven's sake alex you look at the the memo that the intelligence
[2:13:03.160 --> 2:13:09.800]  community inspector general sent to the director of national intelligence that got his ball rolling
[2:13:09.800 --> 2:13:18.280]  with the so-called whistleblower and the inspector general for the intelligence community makes this
[2:13:18.280 --> 2:13:26.840]  conclusion that this is a an urgent matter and he never even listened to or read the transcript
[2:13:26.840 --> 2:13:32.360]  of the phone call he was operating on second and third hand hearsay and never even looked at the
[2:13:32.360 --> 2:13:37.240]  evidence himself why are they so hysterical i mean trump's trying to get the economy back
[2:13:37.240 --> 2:13:42.280]  he's building up the military he's trying to stabilize the dollar we're a net exporter of
[2:13:42.280 --> 2:13:47.160]  energy i mean i think he's been a great president so far why is the system so freaked out in your view
[2:13:48.600 --> 2:13:55.400]  because he is not the system he is fighting the system he's fighting the establishment he's getting
[2:13:55.400 --> 2:14:02.600]  things done by going around the establishment and that's what upsets so many of these people
[2:14:02.600 --> 2:14:08.040]  in government whether they are second or third or even near top peer officials in our government
[2:14:08.600 --> 2:14:14.200]  he's not going to them asking their permission he's not doing things the way they are used to be
[2:14:14.200 --> 2:14:18.840]  doing so you say he's actually really trying to be the chief executive and do what he thinks is best
[2:14:18.840 --> 2:14:26.600]  he he is serving as the chief executive he's making decisions he's being courted of course by the
[2:14:26.600 --> 2:14:32.840]  courts and also by the so-called deep state operatives that just don't like a president
[2:14:32.840 --> 2:14:37.480]  doing things on let me ask you this question and then and then bob barnes going to pop in with
[2:14:37.480 --> 2:14:43.800]  his legal questions i know you're both experts in law but briefly what do you think trump
[2:14:43.800 --> 2:14:48.440]  should do and then when we come back what should we do to try to back this off because it's so
[2:14:48.440 --> 2:14:54.200]  dangerous and it's getting more hysterical it is getting more hysterical i mean the whistle
[2:14:54.200 --> 2:15:00.280]  so-called whistleblower says oh this implicates the attorney general all the attorney general has
[2:15:00.280 --> 2:15:06.120]  to do if anything with this is the president said in the conversation with the Ukrainian president
[2:15:06.680 --> 2:15:12.280]  there is corruption in your country we saw evidence of that in the 2016 elections our

[2:19:13.880 --> 2:19:19.240]  globalists and then trump went after them on how the chai cons are stealing intellectual property
[2:19:19.240 --> 2:19:24.840]  dependent on massive market barriers heavy state subsidies currency manipulation force
[2:19:24.840 --> 2:19:30.520]  technology transfers and the theft of intellectual property it was simply amazing and then he talked
[2:19:30.520 --> 2:19:36.360]  about the ruling leftist elite and their censorship and how it must be met head on my administration
[2:19:36.360 --> 2:19:43.080]  is made clear through social media companies that we will uphold the right of free speech this is

[2:20:12.920 --> 2:20:18.760]  leading a frontal assault on the lives of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:20:22.360 --> 2:20:29.080]  yeah we see president trump dismantling the globalist neocon leftist model of america
[2:20:29.080 --> 2:20:33.960]  taking a backseat and transferring our technology to china and other authoritarian regimes
[2:20:34.680 --> 2:20:40.360]  busy trump filling the second amendment to crime communism and socialism it was like uh
[2:20:40.360 --> 2:20:45.400]  ronald reagan meets george washington beautiful speech at the un we're not talking about that
[2:20:45.400 --> 2:20:49.480]  we're talking about the hysterical moves to impeach the president that we can say well it
[2:20:49.480 --> 2:20:53.560]  they're doing it wrong and they don't have any evidence but as polosi said we're just opening
[2:20:53.560 --> 2:20:58.840]  up these open-ended uh witch hunts six committees that will be all over the news to find something
[2:20:59.400 --> 2:21:03.080]  former congressman bob bar who headed up the impeachment on clinton did it properly
[2:21:04.200 --> 2:21:08.040]  and he he did get you know impeached there in the house but the senate didn't do anything there
[2:21:08.040 --> 2:21:12.760]  let me ask you this question what would you do if you were i mean obviously you can probably talk
[2:21:12.760 --> 2:21:17.480]  to president people listen to you i know the white house students in here some what would you say to
[2:21:17.480 --> 2:21:22.920]  the president about what you think he should do to counter and respond to this because i mean there
[2:21:22.920 --> 2:21:28.040]  has to be some repercussions or are there any repercussions other than what voters do to this
[2:21:28.040 --> 2:21:36.440]  hysterical out of control lying democrat congress and the media to to some extent and not to be
[2:21:36.440 --> 2:21:42.600]  flipping about flipping about it what the president should do is to give the democrats as much rope
[2:21:42.600 --> 2:21:50.520]  as they want uh i think the longer they proceed down this path of just the scattershot approach
[2:21:50.520 --> 2:21:56.360]  going after everything the president says finding an impeachable offense behind every act that the
[2:21:56.360 --> 2:22:03.480]  president takes moving forward with uh this so-called whistleblower report which is so full
[2:22:03.480 --> 2:22:09.480]  of polls that no serious prosecutor would ever give it any credibility all of that i think
[2:22:09.480 --> 2:22:14.600]  is having an effect aside from those squishy republicans we've got to watch out for them
[2:22:14.600 --> 2:22:20.920]  then mit romney's out there uh it's all of this is going to have an effect that ultimately i think
[2:22:20.920 --> 2:22:28.360]  will read rebound to the president's advantage so his advice uh or my advice to him i he certainly
[2:22:28.360 --> 2:22:35.960]  wouldn't ask me would be to keep pressing ahead do not become defensive about this nonsense continue
[2:22:35.960 --> 2:22:41.640]  to uncover the corruption whether it's in the ukraine or in any other country do what needs to
[2:22:41.640 --> 2:22:47.240]  be done to protect america that's exactly what he's doing and he needs to make sure and people around
[2:22:47.240 --> 2:22:53.800]  him need to make sure they don't get the hurt i also by the way i have to tell you i was not
[2:22:53.800 --> 2:23:00.280]  particularly impressed with the witness before the house intelligence committee today i don't know
[2:23:00.280 --> 2:23:07.000]  the gentleman but i was not terribly impressed with the way that proceeded yeah the acting head of
[2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:14.200]  national intelligence uh robert barnes you you last night we were at dinner and we just
[2:23:14.200 --> 2:23:17.320]  followed suitably young turks and mother jones for lying about us we have to do it that's why
[2:23:17.320 --> 2:23:23.080]  you're in town and you were saying no i i think he needs to be confident move forward uh don't
[2:23:23.080 --> 2:23:29.560]  get to turn on this mission exactly what this other smart gentleman just said bar and i'm like
[2:23:29.560 --> 2:23:36.040]  but we've got deep state some of the corrupt elements that are also neocon honing in and that's
[2:23:36.040 --> 2:23:41.480]  why i just and usually my guts right i'm really concerned for trump and i'm usually pretty confident
[2:23:41.480 --> 2:23:47.160]  i just can't help the feeling now that sounds kind of kind of squishy itself but just at a gut level
[2:23:47.160 --> 2:23:50.920]  how frothing they are and how it never stops and how they've been proven wrong over and over again
[2:23:50.920 --> 2:23:55.320]  and then they never get in trouble i just i just feel like something has to be done to them well
[2:23:55.320 --> 2:23:59.960]  i mean we talked to yesterday about the possibility that this implicated deep state actors involved
[2:23:59.960 --> 2:24:05.160]  in ukrainian corruption and met romney's advisor exactly and and we didn't know the scope or severity
[2:24:05.160 --> 2:24:10.680]  of it until today and what was in the oh id report that ultimately was disclosed in part today the
[2:24:10.680 --> 2:24:15.240]  memorandum what was disclosed in the whistleblower complaint what was disclosed about the degree
[2:24:15.240 --> 2:24:22.120]  and the severity and the scope of collusion and corruption involving uh xca related spooks uh romney
[2:24:22.120 --> 2:24:27.720]  related advisors deep state connected parties uh involved in sitting on the board the same board
[2:24:27.720 --> 2:24:32.680]  that was receiving money and contributions uh that hunter biden uh joe biden's son was during this
[2:24:32.680 --> 2:24:38.200]  time period suggests a deep degree of deep state infiltration and implication by what the president
[2:24:38.200 --> 2:24:42.840]  was talking about with the president of ukraine that they would be unveiling and and revealing
[2:24:42.840 --> 2:24:46.920]  the scope and severity of corruption collusion of deep state operatives in various foreign
[2:24:46.920 --> 2:24:51.480]  government operations that ukraine is sort of the tip of the spear that reveals the scope and the
[2:24:51.480 --> 2:24:56.600]  scale of obama administration corruption deep spy exactly so we know a lot of these power players
[2:24:56.600 --> 2:25:01.400]  have been doing dirty stuff there for a long time bob bar and so i'm not trying to pick this as more
[2:25:01.400 --> 2:25:07.160]  dangerous than it is but we are seeing some other players here coming in and and putting pressure
[2:25:07.160 --> 2:25:12.760]  on trump are you concerned about that uh it's always something to be concerned about and one
[2:25:12.760 --> 2:25:19.480]  has to maintain one's defensives uh at the same time as one is on the offense doing what needs
[2:25:19.480 --> 2:25:25.480]  to be done such as the regulatory reforms and making sure that our allies overseas uh pay
[2:25:25.480 --> 2:25:32.760]  their fair share to make sure that we continue to uh push back against iran's terrorist efforts
[2:25:32.760 --> 2:25:39.240]  we need to continue to do that but the provident needs to defend against these attacks without
[2:25:39.240 --> 2:25:44.600]  being defensive and there are some things that can be done alexa for example there's still
[2:25:45.160 --> 2:25:50.440]  in many of the different departments of the administration of the government there still
[2:25:50.440 --> 2:25:57.000]  are obama holdovers a number of positions deep positions including a lot of them that don't
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:26:04.440]  require sending confirmation that still have not been filled by people who are loyal to this
[2:26:04.440 --> 2:26:08.120]  administration that's one of trump's biggest failures is because he points people that say
[2:26:08.120 --> 2:26:12.840]  they're gonna do the right thing they betray him and bring in like you said obama hillary people
[2:26:13.640 --> 2:26:17.640]  soros people what would you do because i mean the president would listen to you you're highly
[2:26:17.640 --> 2:26:21.480]  respected who do you think would be somebody that could be trusted to be brought in to actually go
[2:26:21.480 --> 2:26:29.240]  through and chop heads off well i've i've actually been uh very impressed with uh with bill bar my
[2:26:29.240 --> 2:26:34.120]  namesake he and i don't agree on everything i have a little different view of some privacy matters
[2:26:34.120 --> 2:26:41.320]  for example than he does but in terms of getting a handle on his department and making sure that it
[2:26:41.320 --> 2:26:48.200]  does the right thing for both the law and for this president i've been very impressed with him uh
[2:26:48.200 --> 2:26:55.160]  couldn't somebody like whitaker be like your corruptions are too uh i don't know whitaker i
[2:26:55.160 --> 2:27:01.320]  know him by reputation as a fellow former us attorney uh i've been very i was very impressed
[2:27:01.320 --> 2:27:09.320]  with him during his uh his short tenure uh what you need you need people who have back phone uh
[2:27:09.320 --> 2:27:15.240]  who know the law uh i tell you i even though he's not a lawyer i was very impressed with
[2:27:15.240 --> 2:27:23.320]  kori luandowski and his appearance last week uh and that's the sort of personality we need uh in
[2:27:23.320 --> 2:27:29.400]  positions uh you know not that he as i say he's not a lawyer sure but it's that type of getting on
[2:27:29.400 --> 2:27:37.400]  the offense and tearing them up but he he he he stood his ground he did not allow them to push
[2:27:37.400 --> 2:27:44.520]  him around and he said what needed to be said that that was missing today you can't go up to the hill
[2:27:44.520 --> 2:27:52.360]  with a with an adverse opposition congress and be defensive and try and think through every single
[2:27:52.360 --> 2:27:58.600]  thing that you're saying that flounder around trouble you need to know what you're saying you
[2:27:58.600 --> 2:28:05.000]  need to be firm uh and we just didn't see that happen today there were so many times this morning
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:10.520]  where i want to sort of reach into the uh into the uh that acting director needs to be removed i
[2:28:10.520 --> 2:28:15.160]  agree he did not come off well well we really appreciate your time we really appreciate the

[2:33:45.880 --> 2:33:49.960]  ladies and gentlemen and then i'm going to place the more clips from trump's speech a couple days
[2:33:49.960 --> 2:33:54.280]  ago that we haven't gotten to that's just so important because really what the democrats are doing
[2:33:55.000 --> 2:34:03.160]  is distracting us from the positive things that are happening and i agree with you a day ago
[2:34:03.160 --> 2:34:09.800]  thinking this is going to blow up in their face and i agree with bob bar as well except as you're
[2:34:09.800 --> 2:34:14.760]  now saying the deep state is really threatened and if they don't start getting in some trouble
[2:34:14.760 --> 2:34:19.880]  they're just so arrogant they want control where presidents are these kept creatures
[2:34:19.880 --> 2:34:24.360]  that they dominate that they run and and that's been the problem because they've been bought
[2:34:24.360 --> 2:34:29.240]  off by the chai comms and others these people are literally anti-american spies brokering
[2:34:29.240 --> 2:34:33.560]  our demise and they are the number one enemy of this country i mean they're just a bunch of
[2:34:33.560 --> 2:34:38.680]  entitled scum trump needs to double down on deep state corruption and collusion and investigating
[2:34:38.680 --> 2:34:44.840]  it in ukraine wherever it leads trump needs to double down on the uh on preventing the chai
[2:34:44.840 --> 2:34:49.400]  comm model from becoming the world's model of economic social and cultural power uh trump
[2:34:49.400 --> 2:34:54.360]  needs to double down on the degree to which big tech is trying to censor and suppress voices and
[2:34:54.360 --> 2:34:59.560]  speech and prevent his audience from being heard and his audience from hearing him uh and trump
[2:34:59.560 --> 2:35:04.600]  needs to double down on deep state investigation and prosecution in the case of andrew mccabe and
[2:35:04.600 --> 2:35:09.720]  others attorney general bar needs to deliver he first delivered by preventing robert moeller
[2:35:09.720 --> 2:35:14.360]  from continuing to run amok the deep state has now found their backup plan which is the democratic
[2:35:14.360 --> 2:35:19.960]  house and the democratic house acting as their front operation uh for this impeachment effort
[2:35:19.960 --> 2:35:24.440]  that really is about protecting their own institutional corruption and interests and
[2:35:24.440 --> 2:35:28.760]  prerogatives against the president's elected political power uh and threatening him and
[2:35:28.760 --> 2:35:32.600]  threatening the president of ukraine for trying to expose their corruption and collusion with
[2:35:32.600 --> 2:35:37.320]  democratic party elites uh in various parts of the world including the biden family's corruption
[2:35:37.320 --> 2:35:42.120]  during the obama administration and spy gate both of which are related to and are implicated by
[2:35:42.120 --> 2:35:47.240]  the ukraine investigation but on top of that in addition to it they need to meaningfully
[2:35:47.240 --> 2:35:52.360]  thoroughly completely make sure the deep state starts to face real consequence for their corruption
[2:35:52.360 --> 2:35:56.680]  and collusion with a meaningful prosecution and indictment of andrew mccabe there's already been
[2:35:56.680 --> 2:36:01.560]  a referral to prosecute him from the inspector general the obama appointed inspector general
[2:36:01.560 --> 2:36:06.360]  the department of justice there's already been a referral from the u.s attorney in the washington
[2:36:06.360 --> 2:36:11.160]  dc there's already been approval from the criminal section chief of the department of justice
[2:36:11.160 --> 2:36:16.280]  entirely the number two to william bar bar has approved it it's time to indict it's time that
[2:36:16.280 --> 2:36:21.240]  there be consequences for the criminal activities and the illicit actions of these high ranking
[2:36:21.240 --> 2:36:25.880]  obama administration appointees who corrupted the department of justice corrupted the federal
[2:36:25.880 --> 2:36:30.360]  bureau of investigation corrupted the national security agency corrupted our intelligence
[2:36:30.360 --> 2:36:35.560]  apparatus corrupted our five eyes relationships in the uk and australia to try to do a political
[2:36:35.560 --> 2:36:40.600]  hit job and spy operation on president trump and those aligned and allied with president trump
[2:36:40.600 --> 2:36:46.120]  and this is now deep state q part two the deep state through the democratic house trying to take
[2:36:46.120 --> 2:36:50.600]  out the president scare the president terrorize the president intimidate the president threaten
[2:36:50.600 --> 2:36:55.800]  the president obstruct justice on their own accord by preventing a full meaningful investigation
[2:36:55.800 --> 2:36:59.640]  into their corruption collusion with democratic it's just incredible they're going for broke and
[2:36:59.640 --> 2:37:03.000]  we've got to raise the alarm it's why they've been shutting everybody down ahead of this
[2:37:03.000 --> 2:37:08.600]  they're don't want to let him have the election i'm guaranteeing you folks like i told you that
[2:37:09.400 --> 2:37:13.400]  he would win and we were right about that and so much other things i can see it in their eyes
[2:37:13.400 --> 2:37:16.920]  even if it's destructive even though it ends up destroying them in the process
[2:37:16.920 --> 2:37:21.960]  the chai comms the eu the globalist are funding all of us from the outside they don't care the
[2:37:21.960 --> 2:37:26.440]  democrats end up destroying themselves that's even better they're wrecking the country this
[2:37:26.440 --> 2:37:32.840]  is 21st century warfare fifth generational warfare sixth generational warfare and it's
[2:37:32.840 --> 2:37:37.560]  happening and we have to recognize it and go back to choosing a side are we for america
[2:37:37.560 --> 2:37:44.200]  or globalism and and it's old primitive systems that defend you against fifth dimensional warfare
[2:37:44.760 --> 2:37:49.640]  fifth generational warfare that confuse and manipulate amalgamate you just choose a side
[2:37:49.640 --> 2:37:55.000]  you back up to the hill that defeats the enemy it's it's so simple we know trump's for real

[2:39:34.680 --> 2:39:39.560]  had 30 something lawsuits filed on us we'd had plenty of money but this is a war we've gotten
[2:39:39.560 --> 2:39:44.040]  20 something of them thrown out uh you know thanks to the barns and some of the other great
[2:39:44.040 --> 2:39:48.760]  lawyers but it's it's been one hell of a war and i'm not a victim we expect it all of this it's
[2:39:48.760 --> 2:39:53.480]  just we need the financial support then we'll continue on without backing down uh but uh laura
[2:39:53.480 --> 2:39:59.560]  you wanted to get into uh why they're attacking trump so much so i think it's all tied into the
[2:39:59.560 --> 2:40:05.800]  speed as well i think it's all tied into the speech he gave at the united nation oh yeah so the speed
[2:40:05.800 --> 2:40:12.360]  is because um and then here's nancy polosi dottering around for two and a half years not
[2:40:12.360 --> 2:40:17.320]  bringing in um charges uh you know against president trump and then all of a sudden
[2:40:17.960 --> 2:40:22.760]  before you know before even information is released it done in such an incredible speed it
[2:40:22.760 --> 2:40:27.880]  doesn't even make sense she you know brings these impeachment charges or is attempting to
[2:40:28.520 --> 2:40:33.000]  my thinking is and i want to know what you guys think i think that it's because he walked into
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:40.200]  the un which i think the globalists think of as their house their place their domain he walked in
[2:40:40.200 --> 2:40:47.480]  and he had a message of strength individualism um individualism and coming to countries as well as
[2:40:47.480 --> 2:40:52.280]  individuals themselves telling these other leaders to lift up their own people lift up their own
[2:40:52.280 --> 2:40:57.320]  economies their own countries it's not collectivism and that's what the globalists want they want
[2:40:57.320 --> 2:41:03.560]  collectivism they want the u.s to just follow their their lead and obama spent eight years
[2:41:03.560 --> 2:41:09.080]  essentially demoting us on the world stage apologizing demoting and i think they want america
[2:41:09.080 --> 2:41:15.720]  to kind of take a backseat now and kind of fade back and trump is like uh uh that's not happening
[2:41:15.720 --> 2:41:21.800]  and i think when he walked in and said the words he said at that point they were like move i want
[2:41:21.800 --> 2:41:26.440]  to get bob's take on that but we're starting a show every other weekend and soon it'll be every
[2:41:26.440 --> 2:41:31.080]  weekend that some of our best callers and so please give us your name and number if you'd like to be

[2:42:12.280 --> 2:42:16.920]  to doing what he was elected to do to challenge deep state corruption collusion involving various
[2:42:16.920 --> 2:42:21.000]  foreign governments and foreign operations and using those foreign governments and infiltrating

[2:42:24.680 --> 2:42:29.240]  american elections is why this is here this is solely because the president is keeping his word

[2:47:28.920 --> 2:47:34.600]  hour i want to play a few more of these trump clips from an amazing speech but there's a

[2:47:48.760 --> 2:47:54.040]  want to pick it up and i want to remind people something we became number one on
[2:47:56.440 --> 2:48:01.400]  rocu with 40 million users when we got banned six months ago or so there were a few places we
[2:48:01.400 --> 2:48:07.960]  weren't we were already one of their top news but we did a new design volunteers did it went to the
[2:48:07.960 --> 2:48:13.640]  number one in trending and was said to become number one on um rocu i even had rocu in my house
[2:48:15.320 --> 2:48:19.720]  and when when when it went to number one on trending the left freaked out and they
[2:48:20.280 --> 2:48:24.360]  they they followed news reports that jones is sending people to sandy hook family's homes
[2:48:24.360 --> 2:48:29.240]  he's saying kill children and they had democrats say that i've sued one of them and that's how they
[2:48:29.240 --> 2:48:35.400]  took me off no proof just he's saying when your platform kill children total lies but that's the
[2:48:35.400 --> 2:48:42.520]  type of economic terrorism that we see going on very dangerous well we're number one on cloud tv
[2:48:42.520 --> 2:48:47.960]  it's like rocu has millions of subscribers and uh they own tv stations that are on national cable
[2:48:48.760 --> 2:48:55.560]  like one american news and we have more viewers on cloud tv than all their major channels all
[2:48:55.560 --> 2:48:59.400]  their major news channels combined that's something we can tell you talk to the head of it today we
[2:48:59.400 --> 2:49:05.320]  already knew that but we're just go ahead and tell folks more than newsmax more than oan more than

[2:50:52.040 --> 2:50:55.960]  i could play a game like a lot of folks doing black friday raise price before then lower it we

[2:51:07.080 --> 2:51:09.880]  and then i put myself in that predicament because people are like well if you just charge more you
[2:51:09.880 --> 2:51:14.280]  don't have any problem they'd still buy it that's not how it works because people are now trained

[2:52:15.160 --> 2:52:20.840]  it lee then we'll go to charles and then we'll go to nick and greg uh charles thanks for holding
[2:52:20.840 --> 2:52:26.200]  your awesome from st louis welcome sir hey boss how you doing i'm doing all right man i'm we're
[2:52:26.200 --> 2:52:31.560]  hanging in there but it's getting crazy yeah i know how it is hey i just want to tell you i'm really
[2:52:31.560 --> 2:52:35.320]  glad you're going after the young turks and everything man i'm really glad about that
[2:52:35.320 --> 2:52:40.120]  sir i have to i mean when people say you're basically a child pornographer or they say
[2:52:40.120 --> 2:52:44.760]  you're saying kill kids you gotta sue them you ain't lying i think it's i think it's a good
[2:52:44.760 --> 2:52:49.560]  thing you're doing it i do love the products to be 12 i'm a truck driver so you know i love the
[2:52:49.560 --> 2:52:55.400]  turbo force and then i take on top of it brain force it makes me stay alert all day my one
[2:52:55.400 --> 2:52:59.640]  question is where do you guys think this is going to go after this i mean if they actually are able
[2:52:59.640 --> 2:53:03.240]  to impeach trump don't they realize that the american people are still going to vote trump in
[2:53:03.240 --> 2:53:09.880]  that's another good point i'm still gonna vote for trump i don't care what they do how does that
[2:53:09.880 --> 2:53:14.520]  work legally because so legally the impeachment process is the first process it's literally like
[2:53:14.520 --> 2:53:19.000]  wouldn't that impeach this election he could just run again oh i mean there's no question i mean if
[2:53:19.000 --> 2:53:23.880]  they try to remove him uh that wouldn't prevent him from running for president so the it doesn't
[2:53:23.880 --> 2:53:27.400]  prevent the election even if they tried to successfully remove i hadn't thought of that they
[2:53:27.400 --> 2:53:31.480]  could they could nullify this election and he just gets elected again right exactly so the
[2:53:31.480 --> 2:53:36.200]  who we should start that movement if you impeach we reelect oh yeah no doubt i love the colors please
[2:53:36.200 --> 2:53:43.320]  continue us sir hashtag we reelect for impeachment i agree you know we'll reelect no matter what
[2:53:43.320 --> 2:53:48.920]  what should the hashtag be the i mean something to the effect of they can't really remove them if
[2:53:48.920 --> 2:53:53.400]  they remove we reelect he's right back into power there's gotta be short like reelect no matter what
[2:53:53.400 --> 2:54:00.360]  or uh it's something like that the uh removal doesn't stop re-election um it legally it doesn't
[2:54:00.360 --> 2:54:04.440]  preclude it whatsoever so it's up to the people to continue to maintain and sustain their support
[2:54:04.440 --> 2:54:09.240]  of the president because it's the true fuel for the trump revolution it's the true firewall
[2:54:09.240 --> 2:54:16.840]  against the deep state efforts absolutely uh anything else lee uh this is charles i'm sorry
[2:54:16.840 --> 2:54:20.680]  charles i'm brained into this i said go to lee they went to charles i'm all over the map sorry

[2:55:24.840 --> 2:55:28.520]  they're still a hardcore group of americans that are huge and that are really a silent majority

[2:56:10.600 --> 2:56:15.800]  if colloidal silver is great that that gold's good at knocking stuff out what i mean i don't
[2:56:15.800 --> 2:56:20.520]  know you away man honestly like when i was the first time when i first started taking it
[2:56:20.520 --> 2:56:25.560]  not to use a cartoon analogy but i felt like fry when he drank the hundredth cup of coffee
[2:56:27.240 --> 2:56:33.480]  if i'm trying to if you're saying you get energy from drinking um i get energy in my mind it's like
[2:56:34.360 --> 2:56:41.480]  it it it it opens my mind i mean it's it's uh because your your mind is a bio a bio computer
[2:56:41.480 --> 2:56:47.320]  and and uh it is your brain's electrochemical and i know that ancient royalty used to try to
[2:56:47.320 --> 2:56:51.800]  like drink electures with gold in it and stuff what is that what mana from heaven was
[2:56:52.840 --> 2:56:58.040]  what was the little cakes with with the stardust gold in it but i'm just telling you man i i pay

[2:57:02.760 --> 2:57:08.120]  to the info wars crew you know people have asked me to come out with colloidal gold so what's it
[2:57:08.120 --> 2:57:13.560]  called mono atomic mono atomic gold it's a liquid you could you use it it would come in like in a
[2:57:13.560 --> 2:57:19.880]  dropper like the uh x2 and you you you put it in your mouth or put it in water i take it straight
[2:57:19.880 --> 2:57:24.680]  because the taste doesn't bother me and i want the full effect but you can uh there's people you can
[2:57:24.680 --> 2:57:29.240]  actually this is going to happen because i believe you but i'm going to take some put him on hold
[2:57:29.240 --> 2:57:32.200]  and get the name of the company and we'll come back to you real quickly to your political point
[2:57:32.200 --> 2:57:35.880]  and i'll take it and i'll see what happens because i see both don't affect me because it really works
[2:57:35.880 --> 2:57:40.280]  all out and i've heard people love it for for for battling you know infections and stuff i know
[2:57:40.280 --> 2:57:46.040]  silverworks it's what the gold did i know most of you realize this but i'm going to say it again

[2:57:53.400 --> 2:57:57.240]  the individuals that have done the research to understand the global spattle plan and we know
[2:57:57.240 --> 2:58:02.440]  how to take them down that's why they're so upset think how far we've come together you know even
[2:58:02.440 --> 2:58:07.400]  if we were losing we'd all still keep fighting on because the right thing to do against the truly
[2:58:07.400 --> 2:58:13.400]  satanic forces of the new world order who've really taken the mask off the lines in the sand for

[2:59:58.120 --> 3:00:03.720]  yeah you found it the tip of the spear that means we're pretty ragtag here but the truth
[3:00:04.440 --> 3:00:06.360]  overrides a big mountain of lies
[3:00:06.360 --> 3:00:12.120]  Robert Barnes riding shotgun with us Lee Stranahan taking over about 15 minutes but
[3:00:12.120 --> 3:00:16.680]  i want to get to your calls we're gonna go to lee and we're gonna go to chris then greg's a vet
[3:00:16.680 --> 3:00:20.680]  ex-police officer says this is gonna start a civil war i think that's what they're trying to do
[3:00:20.680 --> 3:00:25.560]  about him in about five minutes but lee in texas interesting about the atomic gold uh now let's
[3:00:25.560 --> 3:00:33.880]  get into your view on this impeachment hysteria i think they have no choice but to impeach i think
[3:00:33.880 --> 3:00:39.240]  you're dealing with a criminal syndicate whose back is against the wall and they they know heads
[3:00:39.240 --> 3:00:43.880]  you're gonna roll it if trump's able to stay in office and and actually execute justice i mean i
[3:00:43.880 --> 3:00:48.200]  think that's it bob like you've been saying it doesn't make sense it's reckless it's crazy but
[3:00:48.200 --> 3:00:52.280]  that's what criminals do in their corner no doubt about it it is the only way that they can threaten
[3:00:52.280 --> 3:00:56.600]  both the president united states different people in the administration who would be interested in
[3:00:56.600 --> 3:01:00.440]  uh actually meaningfully investigating this they're trying to send a message if you really
[3:01:00.440 --> 3:01:05.560]  indict mccabe if you really invest we can defeat you exactly or at a minimum we'll try to remove
[3:01:05.560 --> 3:01:09.560]  you we'll try to threaten we'll we'll try to get people fired we'll try to get people so this is
[3:01:09.560 --> 3:01:15.240]  about them enforcing their will absolutely it's maintaining their leverages and levers of power
[3:01:15.240 --> 3:01:21.000]  against the president's elected power it it is proof that the deep state is real and exist and
[3:01:21.000 --> 3:01:25.400]  it's really amazing that trump hasn't backed down and has done so much good i mean he's
[3:01:25.400 --> 3:01:29.560]  we actually got a good president that's battling this is crazy oh yeah he has a fearless backbone
[3:01:29.560 --> 3:01:34.200]  and that is critical and essential but he himself by himself cannot sustain and maintain his power
[3:01:34.200 --> 3:01:38.920]  the his power comes from the people comes from he's got to go after silicon valley which he said he
[3:01:38.920 --> 3:01:45.560]  do in this speech at the u n he better do it anything else lee justice be done may the heavens
[3:01:45.560 --> 3:01:49.720]  fall that's a good point thank you sir god bless you all right christian chicago then
[3:01:49.720 --> 3:01:55.160]  greg and others christ you're on the air thanks for holding hey alex um i don't disrespect
[3:01:55.160 --> 3:02:01.560]  for the previous guest uh but i'm sorry but attorney general bar i think is the reason he
[3:02:01.560 --> 3:02:07.320]  was confirmed so easily and no one rose was raised in hell about it is i think he's there to put the
[3:02:07.320 --> 3:02:13.080]  knife into trump to be honest with you another point is um you know paul craig roberts and you
[3:02:13.080 --> 3:02:18.440]  guys were covering this back in 2014 and it was always interesting to me why ukraine was such a
[3:02:18.440 --> 3:02:24.920]  big deal but i think essentially everybody in the deep state is has benefited financially from
[3:02:24.920 --> 3:02:30.760]  that sure they always use a war zone proxy zone to line pockets oh no doubt about that and i understand
[3:02:30.760 --> 3:02:35.160]  the concern about attorney general bar the attorney general bars association and affiliation with
[3:02:35.160 --> 3:02:39.640]  establishment political interest goes back many decades and that's why there was concern by some
[3:02:39.640 --> 3:02:44.600]  he's there to protect the deep state by not going to war with trump that's the smart third rail i mean
[3:02:44.600 --> 3:02:48.600]  i agree with you but the crazy deep state thinks they can beat everybody go ahead and finish your
[3:02:48.600 --> 3:02:53.960]  point then i'm gonna get uh so but i mean the ukraine you look back at all that that article
[3:02:53.960 --> 3:02:58.360]  by paul craig roberts is great i was just reading it again the looting of ukraine has begun he talked
[3:02:58.360 --> 3:03:02.920]  uh you know victorian newland phone call you know all this stuff since we don't
[3:03:02.920 --> 3:03:07.400]  can't remember last week we're not going to remember 2014 but it was it's all been there
[3:03:07.400 --> 3:03:13.400]  don't remember and the whole phone call that got intercepted screw the eu screw russia we
[3:03:13.400 --> 3:03:16.840]  had to get roberts back on he was dead on about that oh no doubt about it i mean he looked at
[3:03:16.840 --> 3:03:20.680]  attorney general bar he may in fact be sincere we're going to find out if that's why he needs to
[3:03:20.680 --> 3:03:24.600]  take action against adrian mccabe to show his authenticity because i think when he came in
[3:03:24.600 --> 3:03:28.840]  he viewed what the deep state was doing was dangerous to the republic dangerous to democracy
[3:03:28.840 --> 3:03:32.920]  dangerous he doesn't have an institutional problem with their apparatus he has a problem with their
[3:03:32.920 --> 3:03:37.800]  particular ideological power and riching approach that they currently have that's reckless and dangerous
[3:03:37.800 --> 3:03:41.400]  for the united states and for the world and so we'll see if he takes meaningful action because
[3:03:41.400 --> 3:03:46.360]  now he will be presented with a direct clear clean opportunity to do so and so if he does so then he
[3:03:46.360 --> 3:03:51.320]  can help change the equation trump needs to double down bar needs to double down they need to continue
[3:03:51.320 --> 3:03:56.120]  to make the fight and they need their their audience their base to continue to provide the
[3:03:56.120 --> 3:04:01.080]  exactly the threat is the out of control globalist left yes and even the old establishments gotta
[3:04:01.080 --> 3:04:05.640]  know that now and all we're saying is stabilize the country stop it this is insane a final point
[3:04:05.640 --> 3:04:13.400]  go ahead uh christ uh you know yes or romney is the right in the false left right paradigm and
[3:04:13.400 --> 3:04:18.200]  that you know i think they're like if this guy goes down we're done and and one other note real
[3:04:18.200 --> 3:04:25.240]  quick they these guys will burn joe biden that fool that idiot that babbling nonsensical twist
[3:04:25.240 --> 3:04:29.240]  they will burn him down quicker than anything if they can get the trump this way i mean
[3:04:30.360 --> 3:04:35.320]  this is how desperate they've gotten exactly because this will destroy him and even ties to
[3:04:35.320 --> 3:04:39.960]  obama and others if they're playing with fire great points thank you so much we'll be back
[3:04:39.960 --> 3:04:45.320]  with a few more calls with greg nick adam and jessey and then least ran ahead takes over for a
[3:04:45.320 --> 3:04:55.400]  deep look at the ukraine looting stay with us do you feel that my style is wrong or my substance
[3:04:55.400 --> 3:05:01.720]  is wrong trying to fact check the present the deceptive umpty dumpty troll known as brian stelter
[3:05:01.720 --> 3:05:08.040]  his little weasel minion oliver darcy have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the
[3:05:08.040 --> 3:05:12.680]  air and censor us and of course he famously settled on many others that trump is the info wars
[3:05:12.680 --> 3:05:19.000]  president trump's furious reaction to facebook's action showcases that he is i'm sorry to say
[3:05:19.000 --> 3:05:24.920]  that info wars president and you know what is true our audience of activists our guests our crew
[3:05:24.920 --> 3:05:29.880]  and my drive and your drive has brought trump the white house and other nationalists to power around
[3:05:29.880 --> 3:05:34.520]  the world and now trump's openly coming out declaring war on these globalist tyrants and
[3:05:34.520 --> 3:05:39.720]  they're unelected anti-human tyrannies so this is a day of great victory and i salute you all
[3:05:39.720 --> 3:05:45.000]  but now in the thick of the fight so info wars store dot com for products you need massive sales
[3:05:45.000 --> 3:05:49.800]  now so we can continue on to the future and give these bastards one hell of a fight right until
[3:05:49.800 --> 3:06:03.160]  the end until we've defeated them live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[3:06:08.920 --> 3:06:12.920]  we can see from miles and miles and miles i'm gonna tell the establishment that
[3:06:13.720 --> 3:06:18.120]  once people are awake the globalism and corporate corruption and how these inside deals work
[3:06:18.120 --> 3:06:24.200]  the naivete of america that we've had since the 50s is gone and we didn't have the naivete
[3:06:24.200 --> 3:06:29.560]  240 years ago that's why we crave the country so the season of awakening over the world's here
[3:06:29.560 --> 3:06:36.200]  and there's nothing you can do to stop it in fact you could try to go with it and survive but you're
[3:06:36.200 --> 3:06:43.080]  not going to so fill your hand as they say you're going to lose and you can see the rotting edifice
[3:06:43.080 --> 3:06:49.080]  of the establishment uh it's it's it's frightening though and how reckless they are greg in texas
[3:06:49.080 --> 3:06:55.320]  a former veteran and police officer uh this is the beginning of a civil war uh and i think that's
[3:06:55.320 --> 3:06:59.640]  what they want i think they realize they they have to wreck the west to get control china sitting
[3:06:59.640 --> 3:07:05.240]  back funding and along with others uh where do you see all this going i think civil war they've
[3:07:05.240 --> 3:07:13.000]  already kicked it off um this shows it right here they've already gone hot without firing a bullet
[3:07:13.000 --> 3:07:19.800]  um it's already been done um legalese wise uh they've gone after you they've gone after us
[3:07:20.680 --> 3:07:27.320]  um through social media uh you can see it um all around the country portland and wherever
[3:07:27.320 --> 3:07:32.840]  they attack us uh you're making some good points but just back off your phone a little bit for me
[3:07:32.840 --> 3:07:38.680]  because it's a little muffled i apologize no no no it's okay i'm sorry you kidding my phone sounds
[3:07:38.680 --> 3:07:44.120]  like crap let me just say this i used to bash cops when they were bad and i and i still do
[3:07:44.120 --> 3:07:49.320]  but i always noticed it went viral and i didn't realize till later that google was taking stuff
[3:07:49.320 --> 3:07:52.920]  that wasn't even true about police and putting it out not the police are perfect and the government's
[3:07:52.920 --> 3:07:59.400]  got a lot of problems but they wanted that social upheaval to cause little local civil wars to have
[3:07:59.400 --> 3:08:05.320]  the u n come in obama actually did this and try to have the u n take over police departments uh
[3:08:05.320 --> 3:08:08.680]  just like they wanted to take over ice and all the rest of it so that was why that was being
[3:08:08.680 --> 3:08:13.080]  done and i think you were saying you saw social media being used against the police is that what
[3:08:13.080 --> 3:08:22.680]  you were saying well i've seen that used against police of you i've seen uh social media cut off
[3:08:22.680 --> 3:08:28.120]  for us you you say you say certain things on social media and they just cut you off oh exactly it's
[3:08:28.120 --> 3:08:35.880]  a i can't say anything positive to to to rebut just like you've always been saying and then and
[3:08:35.880 --> 3:08:43.560]  then you look at congress that does nothing and to help us and now you see what they're doing to
[3:08:43.560 --> 3:08:50.360]  attack full stream and it's it's going it's this is this is the hot phase without even
[3:08:50.360 --> 3:08:56.040]  shut firing a bullet exactly is total information takeover and and and i'm gonna go back to you
[3:08:56.040 --> 3:09:03.560]  to minute greg with barns we call it censorship but it's a bunch of cartels that spy on us actively
[3:09:04.120 --> 3:09:08.360]  now in text messages it won't let me send all these things they think are politically
[3:09:08.360 --> 3:09:11.240]  incorrect it's not even politically incorrect stuff but it's down to like
[3:09:12.520 --> 3:09:17.320]  microaggression level stuff every they're putting in the algorithm for all communication
[3:09:17.320 --> 3:09:23.080]  to be controlled right now and it's all organized and it's pure evil and and as the caller says
[3:09:23.080 --> 3:09:27.320]  congress is doing nothing well it's very much it's information control and it's thought control
[3:09:27.320 --> 3:09:30.440]  so i mean that's also me the objective and the goal that's what suppression and censorship of
[3:09:30.440 --> 3:09:34.920]  information and expansion is all about that's why and they're trying to scare people and terrorize
[3:09:34.920 --> 3:09:39.160]  people into not sharing their own information not sharing their own intel to be afraid of who's
[3:09:39.160 --> 3:09:44.520]  spying on them frequently the point and purpose of spying isn't necessarily to gain intelligence
[3:09:44.520 --> 3:09:50.600]  and information as it is to intimidate to coerce and to threaten people into not sharing information
[3:09:50.600 --> 3:09:56.200]  into not supporting info wars and to not being part of their local community of being afraid
[3:09:56.200 --> 3:10:00.520]  to talk about what they believe to share what they believe to express what they believe it's
[3:10:00.520 --> 3:10:05.640]  sort of the penopticon come to real life through modern technology big tech has allowed sort of
[3:10:05.640 --> 3:10:11.000]  old science fiction theories to become everyday modern day reality because they're able to control
[3:10:11.000 --> 3:10:15.720]  cabin direct and channel what people say what people think but most importantly what people are
[3:10:15.720 --> 3:10:20.440]  of feel free to say what people feel free to share what people feel free to support so it's
[3:10:20.440 --> 3:10:24.200]  basically self-censorship is what they want to induce through this culture of suppression and
[3:10:24.200 --> 3:10:28.360]  they know psychologically if you bring something in with the ambient background until it goes to a
[3:10:28.360 --> 3:10:34.680]  boil people will adopt it they will consciously not be aware of it but they will they will adapt
[3:10:34.680 --> 3:10:39.240]  to being slaves oh yeah when i was at Yale i did a long study on the on the Hollywood culture and
[3:10:39.240 --> 3:10:43.320]  mainstream culture and why they try to demonize both african-american culture why they try to
[3:10:43.320 --> 3:10:47.640]  demonize poor white blue color white southern and midwestern culture and what you find is these
[3:10:47.640 --> 3:10:51.880]  are these are groups of people and groups of cultures that have been willing to support
[3:10:51.880 --> 3:10:55.480]  alternative independent theories of the way the culture and society and government and power
[3:10:55.480 --> 3:10:59.880]  operates and they want to demonize those people to ordinary americans exactly jump to more calls
[3:10:59.880 --> 3:11:05.880]  thank you greg anything else yes sir i you know you you can see it with the congress with making
[3:11:05.880 --> 3:11:11.880]  up their own version of reality with ukrainian calls you know just they say what your ship is
[3:11:11.880 --> 3:11:15.400]  made up of a fake transfer it's complete it's completely fake it's a fake conversation that
[3:11:15.400 --> 3:11:19.400]  never occurred that the mainstream media is repeating is so where is that going greg
[3:11:22.440 --> 3:11:26.520]  they've already fired the first shot with the war they don't care what the outcome is
[3:11:27.160 --> 3:11:33.240]  they have decided they are going to remove trump in my belief instead look at look at the first
[3:11:33.240 --> 3:11:38.360]  civil war they fired the first shots without even firing a shot in the first civil war
[3:11:38.360 --> 3:11:45.560]  and and here's the deal it trump's just the drawbridge to get to us they blow him out of the
[3:11:45.560 --> 3:11:52.440]  way it's hot almighty exactly right now i love all your products guys i love it i love what you're

[3:13:12.200 --> 3:13:17.880]  brother thank you and uh i just want to give you a shout out i'm really enjoying my super
[3:13:17.880 --> 3:13:22.360]  blue toothpaste up in the ordinate every month for about three or four months now and i got the whole
[3:13:22.360 --> 3:13:28.280]  family using this great product it's concentrated doesn't have any fillers in it oh it just it makes
[3:13:28.280 --> 3:13:34.120]  your mouth fresh all day long i like it's like chew and gum thank you most toothpaste is just
[3:13:34.120 --> 3:13:39.720]  silicate it's a bunch of sand we don't have that yeah i know it anyways i'm calling in reference to
[3:13:39.720 --> 3:13:46.280]  this so-called uh leaker or as a pencil neck adam schiff wants to call him a whistleblower
[3:13:46.280 --> 3:13:52.200]  um i just think it's strange uh the whole tally and conway things the conways in general and
[3:13:52.200 --> 3:13:58.360]  then her husband who's bad mouth and the president all the time um it's just it's odd to me that you
[3:13:58.360 --> 3:14:03.240]  have someone like her working for the president that's so close to him and then her husband is
[3:14:04.280 --> 3:14:09.560]  runs her mouth runs his mouth from the media all the time and i'm just wondering is is there
[3:14:09.560 --> 3:14:15.160]  is it possible that he could have somebody real close to him that's leaking these calls um that
[3:14:15.160 --> 3:14:19.560]  he's having i think i don't think you can be a quote serve two masters like that and i'm just
[3:14:19.560 --> 3:14:24.840]  telling you uh i mean i don't trust conway at all i'll just i'll just say that you want to comment
[3:14:24.840 --> 3:14:29.480]  on that i mean there's no question that her husband has caused substantial problems for her
[3:14:29.480 --> 3:14:35.080]  there's undermined her political career i mean there are stories in dc that she during the campaign
[3:14:35.080 --> 3:14:39.720]  did not save uh you know acted differently than she did publicly for the campaign that privately
[3:14:39.720 --> 3:14:44.600]  she undermined the campaign uh with various uh you know cocktail party conversations i do know
[3:14:44.600 --> 3:14:49.080]  that she was telling people that these she thought trump had no chance to win i didn't mind that because
[3:14:49.080 --> 3:14:53.400]  it helped the odds in england and allowed me to make a lot of money is a moron uh yes i mean
[3:14:53.400 --> 3:14:58.600]  she's a politically skilled propagandist uh but their her degree of commitment to trump is deeply
[3:14:58.600 --> 3:15:04.920]  in question thank you jesse uh adam nick we've got a huge guest coming on an expert on ukraine
[3:15:04.920 --> 3:15:10.120]  both of you guys are about this i'm gonna ask tranny and to take your calls if you wish and i

[3:18:58.440 --> 3:19:05.800]  tuesday the 24th of september 2019 is a historical date president trump threw down the gauntlet and
[3:19:05.800 --> 3:19:12.360]  said globalism is not the future of the planet the future does not belong to globalists and then
[3:19:12.360 --> 3:19:17.480]  trump went after them on how the chai cons are sealing intellectual property depended on massive
[3:19:17.480 --> 3:19:23.720]  market barriers heavy state subsidies currency manipulation force technology transfers and the
[3:19:23.720 --> 3:19:28.360]  theft of intellectual property it was simply amazing and then he talked about the ruling
[3:19:28.360 --> 3:19:34.440]  leftist elite and their censorship and how it must be met head on my administration has made clear
[3:19:34.440 --> 3:19:41.320]  through social media companies that we will uphold the right of free speech this is amazing find
[3:19:41.320 --> 3:19:48.600]  highlights and trumps entire historic speech at info wars dot com and band dot video and not video
[3:19:48.600 --> 3:20:01.880]  and god bless america thank you very much you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:01.880 --> 3:20:08.280]  okay
[3:20:13.480 --> 3:20:18.440]  hey there everybody how you doing my name is lee stranahan i am an investigative reporter and i
[3:20:18.440 --> 3:20:24.440]  host a radio show called fault lines with nixon and stranahan uh that you can find on my periscope
[3:20:24.440 --> 3:20:29.400]  or on my twitter my twitter by the way is at stranahan i want to make sure i got a lot of
[3:20:29.400 --> 3:20:34.760]  stuff to tell you i will i will tell the info wars audience right now this is a story i've been
[3:20:34.760 --> 3:20:41.720]  working on for about three years about the fake russia gates story and specifically about the
[3:20:41.720 --> 3:20:49.640]  collusion of the democrats traitorous republicans like john mccain the deep state when i say the
[3:20:49.640 --> 3:20:55.320]  deep state i wanted to find who i mean the cia like the whistleblower we had uh it's not really
[3:20:55.320 --> 3:20:59.160]  a whistleblower we'll talk about that in a second but this is the story i've been working on for about
[3:20:59.160 --> 3:21:05.240]  three years so it's very very interesting to see the cover-up going on right now but i want to make
[3:21:05.240 --> 3:21:10.600]  sure we get to uh the callers who have been so patiently holding let's start by going to nick
[3:21:10.600 --> 3:21:18.040]  in michigan hey nick how you doing i appreciate you guys taking my call i would have been really
[3:21:18.040 --> 3:21:24.040]  basic about it maybe not even saying anything to just my perspective i need to really compare
[3:21:24.040 --> 3:21:30.120]  what trump's going through right now to catch me by 1963 with all the enemies that kind of crossed
[3:21:30.120 --> 3:21:39.000]  at that point the big oil figures cia etc etc across the world that he had crossed and made
[3:21:39.000 --> 3:21:44.520]  enemies with and looking at the next election maybe it's almost the same thing that he had garnered a
[3:21:45.320 --> 3:21:51.720]  level of popularity that he was going to win the election without you know any opposition
[3:21:51.720 --> 3:21:56.680]  really so going the same route they weren't with what they did but now seeing what we're seeing
[3:21:56.680 --> 3:22:03.160]  maybe this is all the democrats slash states they can do is go this route like they know trump
[3:22:03.160 --> 3:22:07.880]  like jonathan he had a level of momentum behind him going into the election that
[3:22:07.880 --> 3:22:12.680]  is almost unstoppable in a way if you look at it and um i don't know i was just my
[3:22:12.680 --> 3:22:18.680]  sake of this that there is nothing to do now hey nick and i gotta tell you i i think that is a very
[3:22:18.680 --> 3:22:23.640]  astute take let me i was actually thinking it's very uh funny you mentioned that if you believe
[3:22:23.640 --> 3:22:28.520]  in coincidences and i i don't but if you believe in coincidences i was just thinking about this
[3:22:28.520 --> 3:22:34.680]  exact point as i was getting ready for the show about an hour ago i will tell you i do not think
[3:22:34.680 --> 3:22:41.800]  our republic has been in as great danger from the deep state and specifically the cia and now
[3:22:41.800 --> 3:22:47.080]  the elements that are still loyal in the cia to john brennan and i'll talk about him in a second
[3:22:47.080 --> 3:22:52.920]  as we have been uh since prior to the jfk assassination if you know the history of that
[3:22:52.920 --> 3:22:57.320]  nick and it sounds like you do uh but for people who may not be as familiar with it
[3:22:57.960 --> 3:23:05.800]  jfk warned about the dangers of the cia about a month in the new york times a report came out
[3:23:05.800 --> 3:23:11.400]  that jfk was very worried about the cia and that happened a month before he was taken out in dallas
[3:23:11.400 --> 3:23:18.040]  so i actually think you make a an excellent point and thanks a lot for the call let me let me talk
[3:23:18.040 --> 3:23:23.080]  about i'm going to talk about some of that stuff in just a second let's go to uh a final call
[3:23:23.080 --> 3:23:28.680]  thanks so much for holding by the way adam in florida go ahead you're on thanks for taking my
[3:23:28.680 --> 3:23:34.840]  holiday uh just one of the three really quick points first off there's a story by abc that was
[3:23:34.840 --> 3:23:41.160]  kind of i think it came out in july about kind of how he snubbed a reporter about his implications
[3:23:41.160 --> 3:23:47.480]  you know with um china having his vice president he bought out for 1.5 billion and he's dealing with
[3:23:47.480 --> 3:23:53.400]  his son in ukraine did you see that report because i was so surprised that they actually did some
[3:23:53.400 --> 3:23:57.640]  honest reporting and it was really provocative and i'm surprised i haven't really seen it being
[3:23:57.640 --> 3:24:03.240]  pushed more by people on you know trump's you know side or whatever and then you know i have a
[3:24:03.240 --> 3:24:09.240]  couple other real quick things well i i've seen a number of those reports let me talk about your
[3:24:09.240 --> 3:24:13.560]  general point then let me let you hit it real quick on the next point because i have a lot of
[3:24:13.560 --> 3:24:19.080]  material to cover adam i want to make sure i'm able to get to it all uh but but yes let me let me
[3:24:19.080 --> 3:24:26.760]  talk about the general point people need to understand they are being fed a massive misinformation
[3:24:26.760 --> 3:24:32.360]  and disinformation campaign by people trying to cover up this coup that all centers around
[3:24:32.360 --> 3:24:38.600]  ukraine it centers about uh the fake russia gate narrative and i'm going to explain the details
[3:24:38.600 --> 3:24:45.960]  the deep background on that in a second but here's the key exactly what you said you can find the
[3:24:45.960 --> 3:24:50.680]  truth out there in fact one of the stories i'm going to bring up right away is from a source
[3:24:50.680 --> 3:24:57.000]  called politico you may have heard of politico is a mainstream uh you know mainstream political
[3:24:57.000 --> 3:25:02.760]  publication uh it is not a red-pilled political publication at all and the reporters who worked
[3:25:02.760 --> 3:25:08.200]  on the story i'm going to talk about ken vogel uh he works in new york time now he's on the left
[3:25:08.200 --> 3:25:15.720]  but the story i'm about to point everybody to came out in january 2017 before the inauguration
[3:25:15.720 --> 3:25:22.040]  the story is called ukraine efforts to sabotage trump backfire you're seeing it right now i urge
[3:25:22.040 --> 3:25:29.720]  every american to look at this article there's a there's some bs in it but this is a well reported
[3:25:29.720 --> 3:25:35.960]  article and you wouldn't expect it coming from political or ken vogel or david stern now by
[3:25:35.960 --> 3:25:40.120]  the way here's just an interesting trivia thing before i get to the rest of your call nick uh
[3:25:40.120 --> 3:25:44.680]  adam forgive me before i get to the rest of your call here's an interesting trivia thing my radio
[3:25:44.680 --> 3:25:52.520]  co-host garland did a search this morning for ken vogel ukraine he got a different result
[3:25:52.520 --> 3:26:00.040]  on google than on duck duck go you're familiar with duck duck go on google the top search result
[3:26:00.040 --> 3:26:07.640]  that he got said ken vogel under fire for repeating ukraine lies or something like that on duck duck
[3:26:07.640 --> 3:26:13.400]  go it showed that article from politico so isn't it very very interesting the way the new cyber
[3:26:13.400 --> 3:26:18.680]  information war continues against us hey but i want to make sure you get to your point adam what
[3:26:18.680 --> 3:26:23.480]  else you got right and i i only got a couple minutes left in this segment well this is the main
[3:26:23.480 --> 3:26:29.400]  point i've seen kind of with the transcript coming out now with no illicit quick pro quo
[3:26:29.400 --> 3:26:36.520]  so they are now dissecting trump's words as if it was bible and you know manuscript and they are
[3:26:36.520 --> 3:26:43.160]  going through and looking for as judge napolitano said code word and you'll also see adam shift house
[3:26:43.160 --> 3:26:50.520]  intel um saying that uh he is it reads like a mafia boss shakes down so now you're going to see uh
[3:26:50.520 --> 3:26:54.360]  emerging talking point in the media that trump's talking in code words you're going to see michael
[3:26:54.360 --> 3:27:00.840]  cohen invoke like he's some kind of truth teller when he's a lying piece of trash and how trump
[3:27:00.840 --> 3:27:05.320]  oh he talks in code you just got to understand when he says you look at your pie it's nice
[3:27:05.320 --> 3:27:10.520]  you know yeah i know exactly what he said so garbage and i'm not going to hear it and napolitano
[3:27:10.520 --> 3:27:14.840]  i don't know what why he's mad he didn't get his little supreme court nomination
[3:27:14.840 --> 3:27:21.080]  but that guy is turned to the dark side i i unfa i unfollowed uh judge napolitano last night
[3:27:21.080 --> 3:27:25.400]  after after exactly what you're saying adam and let me ask you let me just ask you one question
[3:27:25.400 --> 3:27:32.680]  before you go to break here is donald trump known for his subtlety just ask just ask yourself that
[3:27:32.680 --> 3:27:39.000]  question donald trump one of the reasons people love donald trump is that he's blunt right if he
[3:27:39.000 --> 3:27:44.520]  if he doesn't like you you know it right if you work for him and he doesn't like you this idea
[3:27:44.520 --> 3:27:52.920]  that donald trump suddenly develops a subtle code words rather than if he wanted a if he wanted
[3:27:52.920 --> 3:27:58.200]  look i want you to investigate biden which you should by the way i in fact i'll tell you the
[3:27:58.200 --> 3:28:03.400]  big problem and you hinted at it and we'll get to it after the next after the break here the problem
[3:28:03.400 --> 3:28:09.640]  is trump is surrounded by traders there's any he's starting to realize it you saw it today i'm
[3:28:09.640 --> 3:28:13.400]  going to go into the history after that we get to the break here and i'm going to talk about the

[3:33:13.960 --> 3:33:19.080]  hey there everybody how you doing good afternoon we i come to you on a very very important day i
[3:33:19.080 --> 3:33:26.440]  would say as you know the uh so-called whistleblower report it is not a whistleblower report this is
[3:33:26.440 --> 3:33:31.880]  what i call the deep state report we got breaking headlines by the way just in the past hour or
[3:33:31.880 --> 3:33:37.080]  so the new york times and others are reporting that we now know who the whistleblower is we don't
[3:33:37.080 --> 3:33:43.560]  have a name but it's a cia agent who was in the white house and this is very very important
[3:33:43.560 --> 3:33:49.080]  donald trump said earlier today he thinks the person who did it is the equivalent of a spy and
[3:33:49.080 --> 3:33:54.680]  in fact let's go over this yes in fact they are a spy because they work for the cia but
[3:33:54.680 --> 3:34:03.960]  they're also a spy because they gave the contents of a privileged phone call with a world leader
[3:34:05.240 --> 3:34:09.560]  and wrote up and it looks to me like if this report i'm sure you guys have looked at the
[3:34:09.560 --> 3:34:16.280]  report on this this report looks like it was written by a committee to me it's a very detailed
[3:34:16.280 --> 3:34:20.600]  report with a lot of footnotes and what i want to talk to you about and by the way i'm just going
[3:34:20.600 --> 3:34:26.200]  to do a quick plug here i'm going to mention that i have a website populist.tv and we have
[3:34:26.200 --> 3:34:30.920]  a free newsletter that you can sign up for over there i'm going to start doing a podcast about
[3:34:30.920 --> 3:34:35.800]  this dnc ukraine story i'm going to keep the episodes to five or fifteen minutes and you
[3:34:35.800 --> 3:34:40.520]  can sign up for free for that because this is a very big story now let me talk about the way
[3:34:40.520 --> 3:34:47.880]  crime works in general and the way criminals hide their tracks right one common technique
[3:34:48.600 --> 3:34:55.160]  if you're like let's say accused of murder is you start to lie about the timeline in other
[3:34:55.160 --> 3:35:01.480]  words that the police know that the murder happened at twelve thirty right you want to make sure that
[3:35:01.480 --> 3:35:06.600]  you say you were somewhere else at twelve thirty maybe you can say oh well you know i was at home
[3:35:06.600 --> 3:35:13.400]  i didn't get there till twelve forty five now in just that way i'm going to expose for you the lies
[3:35:13.400 --> 3:35:19.800]  in the timeline in this deep state report the so-called whistleblower report now one of the
[3:35:19.800 --> 3:35:25.640]  things that this is about it's very clear what's been going on is that they're trying to cover up
[3:35:25.640 --> 3:35:32.520]  the dnc ukrainian election interference and collusion and i pointed to an article from politico
[3:35:32.520 --> 3:35:38.440]  that came out in january 2017 and that article has a lot of the essentials that i'm going to tell
[3:35:38.440 --> 3:35:43.880]  you about now this is very significant because this article came out again mainstream source
[3:35:44.680 --> 3:35:51.720]  not a trump supporter source at all and it was a well reported story that interviewed key people
[3:35:51.720 --> 3:36:00.280]  and discussed the ukrainian dnc collusion and interference in the 2016 election now that the
[3:36:00.280 --> 3:36:06.920]  guy you see right there that's petro poroshenko who is petro poroshenko he is the former leader
[3:36:06.920 --> 3:36:13.080]  of the ukraine and he was not elected he was installed basically he was put into place they
[3:36:13.080 --> 3:36:18.920]  may have had a a sham kangaroo election somewhere in the middle there but remember back in 2013
[3:36:18.920 --> 3:36:26.600]  and 2014 if you were watching the news at all you heard about the marvelous uprising in ukraine
[3:36:26.600 --> 3:36:31.800]  where the citizens were all getting together it was like an occupy wall street style protest it was
[3:36:31.800 --> 3:36:38.840]  called the madan right and it was in kiv ukraine and it was people rising up against corruption
[3:36:38.840 --> 3:36:45.240]  right and supposedly what they were worried about was how poroshenko might go with uh
[3:36:45.240 --> 3:36:50.520]  uh not poroshenko forgive me yana kovic at the time victor yana kovic was the leader of ukraine
[3:36:50.520 --> 3:36:57.400]  and and everyone got together now a few things they didn't tell you that entire spectacle was
[3:36:57.400 --> 3:37:06.120]  funded by billionaire hillary clinton donor george soros he's got a uh an NGO a non-government
[3:37:06.120 --> 3:37:11.960]  organization called international renaissance and they don't hide that this is george soros if you
[3:37:11.960 --> 3:37:16.840]  go to the international renaissance website you'll see they make reference to george soros
[3:37:16.840 --> 3:37:22.200]  right on the front page of the website so there's no question that international renaissance
[3:37:22.200 --> 3:37:27.640]  was behind this and let me mention one other billionaire oligarch like soros but you may
[3:37:27.640 --> 3:37:36.280]  not have heard of him this is a guy named victor pinchuk victor pinchuk shows that uh victor pinchuk
[3:37:36.280 --> 3:37:44.680]  is the billionaire uh oligarch in ukraine who's a top clinton foundation donor in fact victor
[3:37:44.680 --> 3:37:53.720]  pinchuk and his name is a pin ch uk victor pinchuk he donated 35 million dollars i'm going to say
[3:37:53.720 --> 3:38:01.800]  that again 35 million dollars to the clinton foundation and so between pinchuk and soros who
[3:38:01.800 --> 3:38:08.280]  gave i think about 8 million in 2015 directly to a pro hillary pack right directly to hillard
[3:38:09.560 --> 3:38:18.280]  between pinchuk and soros these two billionaires were funding along with the clinton state department
[3:38:18.280 --> 3:38:25.400]  because they set this whole thing up when she came in in 2012 they funded the madame coup now this
[3:38:25.400 --> 3:38:31.400]  was make no mistake about it this was a coup and if you want to really learn a lot about this i'm
[3:38:31.400 --> 3:38:37.160]  going to recommend a film called ukraine on fire uh there's a sequel coming out next week
[3:38:37.160 --> 3:38:42.120]  called revealing ukraine that i'm in but watch this film ukraine on fire now i'm going to be
[3:38:42.120 --> 3:38:48.360]  honest with you i didn't know anything about this ukraine stuff at all until i started investigating
[3:38:48.360 --> 3:38:53.720]  this story i didn't realize how the wool had been pulled over my eyes i thought okay well
[3:38:53.720 --> 3:38:58.680]  people are that's a standard uprising but if you're an info wars watcher you've probably heard of the
[3:38:58.680 --> 3:39:05.480]  idea of color revolutions right they did the orange revolution and and soros is a master at this
[3:39:05.480 --> 3:39:12.840]  okay now and ukraine on fire lays out everything now it's important to note by the way one of the
[3:39:12.840 --> 3:39:20.200]  main people the point man in fact on ukraine was none other than joe biden in fact obama sort of
[3:39:20.200 --> 3:39:27.560]  let joe biden handle it and one of the reasons is that joe biden and this this may or may not shock
[3:39:27.560 --> 3:39:35.240]  shock you but joe biden has deep connections with a russian oligarch no it's not putin you've been
[3:39:35.240 --> 3:39:44.040]  lied to about putin this is a guy named kordakosky kho dor k ov sk y and the thing i want to point
[3:39:44.040 --> 3:39:51.000]  you to is a senate resolution in called senate resolution 322 if you know anything about secret
[3:39:51.000 --> 3:39:56.840]  societies it's easy enough to find because that 322 of course is coincidentally the uh secret
[3:39:56.840 --> 3:40:05.880]  number of the skull and bone society but senate resolution 322 in 2006 is a you can look it up
[3:40:05.880 --> 3:40:13.080]  on the congress's website it's about kordakosky now who is kordakosky during the 90s after the
[3:40:13.080 --> 3:40:20.760]  fall of the soviet union kordakosky made billions and he bought a bank called bank menotip and he
[3:40:20.760 --> 3:40:27.000]  bought yukos oil by buying the bank and then throwing everybody out who is trying to bid on
[3:40:27.000 --> 3:40:32.520]  yukos oil yukos oil don't forget rush is one of the biggest producers of energy in the world
[3:40:32.520 --> 3:40:39.720]  so this is about energy buying yukos oil and it's about money laundering because menotip was used
[3:40:39.720 --> 3:40:46.520]  for money laundering now if you look up senate resolution 322 what you'll find is that bill
[3:40:46.520 --> 3:40:53.560]  was sponsored by none other than joe biden in fact he's the only sponsor for it so biden back to
[3:40:53.560 --> 3:41:00.200]  kordakosky and kordakosky has links with soros and i'm going to talk about another link here
[3:41:00.200 --> 3:41:04.040]  to the open world leadership center just remember that name for a little bit we'll talk about it
[3:41:04.040 --> 3:41:11.160]  after the break here's what's fascinating about this bill senate resolution 322 is the co-sponsors
[3:41:11.160 --> 3:41:17.240]  it's not just that joe biden is the sponsor this bill had two co-sponsors now remember
[3:41:17.240 --> 3:41:22.840]  this is 2006 do you want to guess who the two co-sponsors are do you want to see how your
[3:41:22.840 --> 3:41:29.160]  government has been subverted by people like this guy kordakosky by people like biden the two
[3:41:29.160 --> 3:41:37.240]  co-sponsors were barack obama and john mccain and again don't take my word for it go look it up
[3:41:37.240 --> 3:41:46.280]  you'll see the two co-sponsors in 2006 were the two people who ran for president in 2008 in other
[3:41:46.280 --> 3:41:53.320]  words no matter who you voted for in 2008 you were essentially voting for a pro kordakosky person
[3:41:53.320 --> 3:41:59.880]  now this is important because kordakosky was jailed by vladimir putin because the guy was
[3:41:59.880 --> 3:42:04.680]  trying to buy the government and putin was trying to put a stop to the mess that these oligarchs
[3:42:04.680 --> 3:42:11.480]  made russian the 1990s was a disaster people were starving uh and it's all due to the clinton
[3:42:11.480 --> 3:42:18.280]  administration and people like larry summers you may remember her him larry summers was the
[3:42:18.280 --> 3:42:23.160]  treasury secretary and he was the point guy on russia former president of harvard by the way
[3:42:23.160 --> 3:42:31.080]  close friend of jeffrey effstein just coincidentally so all of this in the 1990s led to that madame
[3:42:31.080 --> 3:42:36.600]  coup and right after the break i'm going to get into more of the timeline and the shocking truth
[3:42:36.600 --> 3:42:41.960]  that you can look up for yourself you can't possibly deny it but that the deep state and the
[3:42:41.960 --> 3:42:46.760]  media do not want you to know we got more coming up right after this break you're watching info wars
[3:42:46.760 --> 3:42:55.320]  my name's lee serenade do you feel that my style is wrong or my substance is wrong trying to fact
[3:42:55.320 --> 3:43:01.960]  check the president the deceptive umpty dumpty troll known as brian stelter and his little weasel
[3:43:01.960 --> 3:43:07.800]  minion oliver darcy have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the air into censor
[3:43:07.800 --> 3:43:12.040]  us and of course he famously said along with many others that trump is the info wars president
[3:43:12.040 --> 3:43:17.960]  president trump's furious reaction to facebook's action showcases that he is i'm sorry to say
[3:43:17.960 --> 3:43:23.800]  the info wars president and you know what is true our audience of activists our guests our crew
[3:43:23.800 --> 3:43:28.520]  and my drive and your drive has brought trump the white house and other nationalists to power
[3:43:28.520 --> 3:43:33.320]  around the world and now trump's openly coming out declaring war on these globalist tyrants
[3:43:33.320 --> 3:43:38.760]  and their unelected anti-human tyrannies so this is a day of great victory and i salute you all but

[3:46:02.200 --> 3:46:08.840]  to warn of human animal hybrids and organ harvesting i was the first to begin to warn that babies were
[3:46:08.840 --> 3:46:14.760]  being kept alive after they were born for their organs to be harvested i was the first to warn you
[3:46:14.760 --> 3:46:20.360]  along with paul watson at info wars dot com 15 years ago that google was using microphones and
[3:46:20.360 --> 3:46:27.640]  hidden cameras to record everything you do and hundreds and hundreds of other giant issues like
[3:46:27.640 --> 3:46:32.760]  the federal reserve being private run for profit trying to control our economy that our government
[3:46:32.760 --> 3:46:38.120]  hollywood have been taken over by the commerce chinese on every one of these issues and many others
[3:46:38.120 --> 3:46:43.080]  we've been dead on and we've raised the alarm on the planetary scale that's why the globalist
[3:46:43.080 --> 3:46:48.760]  are trying to shut us down and that's why you are more critical than ever to support the info war
[3:46:48.760 --> 3:47:04.680]  please support the info war however you can you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:04.680 --> 3:47:21.560]  hey there everyone again i want to thank alex jones and everyone here at info wars again for
[3:47:21.560 --> 3:47:28.600]  having me on this historic uh day i would say when this fake whistleblower report came out
[3:47:28.600 --> 3:47:33.320]  we're talking about that and some of the hidden history that the media is hiding from you but
[3:47:33.320 --> 3:47:39.640]  i'm going to urge you by the way don't take my word on any of this look everything up for yourself
[3:47:39.640 --> 3:47:44.520]  and you're going to be shocked that it's all right there in the open and yet no one's talking about
[3:47:44.520 --> 3:47:50.520]  it now before we went to break i was talking about some of the history of russia in the 1990s
[3:47:50.520 --> 3:47:57.480]  after the fall of communism uh and what happened was again i know fan of communism so i was glad
[3:47:57.480 --> 3:48:03.160]  to see that but i like a lot of americans wasn't paying any attention to russia in the 1990s
[3:48:03.160 --> 3:48:08.440]  i knew that there was you know the mafia and all that stuff going on i i knew that there were oligarchs
[3:48:08.440 --> 3:48:13.640]  remember this is all pre-putin it's important to understand but this was also the clinton era
[3:48:13.640 --> 3:48:20.520]  don't forget this is when yeltsin was in charge bill clinton was president and leading russia policy
[3:48:20.520 --> 3:48:25.480]  was a guy named larry summers now larry summers you know alex has been on the jeffrey epstein's
[3:48:25.480 --> 3:48:35.160]  story for about a decade now larry summers is a close friend of jeffrey epstein in fact he donated
[3:48:35.160 --> 3:48:41.080]  millions of dollars to harvard they were introduced through his attorney alan dirshowitz and larry
[3:48:41.080 --> 3:48:46.680]  summers is a key figure here and that story that they just brought up the harvard boys do russia
[3:48:46.680 --> 3:48:52.440]  if you want to really understand how under the clinton administration people like larry summers
[3:48:52.440 --> 3:48:59.800]  people like bill clinton were fleecing russia trying to steal their oil assets this is a great
[3:48:59.800 --> 3:49:06.120]  article to read now the reason this is significant is because as you're going to see in a second
[3:49:06.120 --> 3:49:12.280]  a lot of the same players from this era in the 90s in russia don't forget larry summers was also
[3:49:12.280 --> 3:49:17.560]  the treasury secretary under obama our key figures here and let me mention one other key
[3:49:17.560 --> 3:49:23.400]  figure since we're talking about history a guy you may not have heard of but you may he was bill
[3:49:23.400 --> 3:49:30.600]  clinton's roommate at oxford and his name is strobe talbot strobe like strobe light i didn't
[3:49:30.600 --> 3:49:35.880]  name him but that's who he is strobe talbot again he was bill clinton's oxford roommate
[3:49:35.880 --> 3:49:41.960]  and he was an expert in russia at the time in fact when bill clinton went to communist russia
[3:49:41.960 --> 3:49:47.240]  strobe talbot's the guy who helped him prepare to go now strobe talbot is going to be very very
[3:49:47.240 --> 3:49:53.320]  important here in just a minute because i'm going to tie in everything i'm telling you the ukraine
[3:49:53.320 --> 3:49:59.400]  stuff with the 2016 election interference and strobe talbot let me mention this right now
[3:49:59.400 --> 3:50:03.480]  because it's going to come up it's not just a guy who went to school with clinton he's not just a
[3:50:03.480 --> 3:50:11.000]  guy who's behind russia policy under bill clinton strobe talbot was one of three state department
[3:50:11.000 --> 3:50:16.040]  employees in the obama administration because he was brought back into state under obama
[3:50:16.040 --> 3:50:24.520]  three employees strobe talbot victoria newland and jonathan weiner were all briefed by christopher
[3:50:24.520 --> 3:50:31.800]  steel on that fake steel dossier which i'm here to tell you because i have sources in ukraine
[3:50:32.360 --> 3:50:39.640]  that steel dossier was created in ukraine and the way that happened was they asked people and this
[3:50:39.640 --> 3:50:46.520]  is people related to the soros related to this international renaissance they were brought in
[3:50:46.520 --> 3:50:53.000]  to create a fake dossier in fact people in ukraine were told basically uh and i'm gonna i'll give you
[3:50:53.000 --> 3:50:59.400]  the name nobody's talking about this vasily felipe chuk vasily felipe chuk is the ukrainian
[3:50:59.400 --> 3:51:06.520]  politician who wrote a lot of the fake parts well most of its fake of the uh steel dossier
[3:51:06.520 --> 3:51:12.360]  and strobe talbot bill clinton's college roommate was and one of his closest friends by the way
[3:51:12.360 --> 3:51:17.880]  was one of three people along with victoria newland and jonathan weiner i'll talk about them in a
[3:51:17.880 --> 3:51:25.640]  second who were briefed by christopher steel during the election now why so what what happened here
[3:51:26.840 --> 3:51:32.520]  during the 90s a lot of people were making a lot of money larry summers and his associates in fact
[3:51:32.520 --> 3:51:39.720]  there's a guy you can you can look up who was at harvard jonathan hay h a y who was convicted
[3:51:39.720 --> 3:51:45.800]  of basically taking advantage of his position to make a ton of money in russia taking advantage
[3:51:45.800 --> 3:51:50.520]  of his government position this is corruption at the highest level now i talked about that guy
[3:51:50.520 --> 3:51:58.760]  kortikovsky who is backed by biden right backed by biden backed by obama and backed by mccain
[3:51:58.760 --> 3:52:03.720]  in senate resolution three two two he's a big factor here because you got to understand
[3:52:03.720 --> 3:52:09.800]  kortikovsky if you look up his history he's connected to both bill clinton and the bush
[3:52:09.800 --> 3:52:16.280]  family in fact you've heard of the carlyle group probably that's the uh the the big sort of uh
[3:52:16.280 --> 3:52:23.800]  very secretive oil connected cartel the carlyle group kortikovsky was on the board of the carlyle
[3:52:23.800 --> 3:52:31.080]  group and which along with george hw bush you can find a picture of him and george w bush so this
[3:52:31.080 --> 3:52:39.640]  was a guy who was basically trying to sell russia's oil assets illegally to the united states then
[3:52:39.640 --> 3:52:44.840]  something happened to put a stop to all of that and bladam your putin came in and bladam your
[3:52:44.840 --> 3:52:50.440]  putin when they put him in the the oligarchs put him in position they thought like yeltsin he was
[3:52:50.440 --> 3:52:57.560]  going to be a puppet instead and i got to tell you and i i want a full disclosure i work for radius
[3:52:57.560 --> 3:53:03.480]  butnik i i don't work for radius butnik because i say this but because i do it's russian funded
[3:53:03.480 --> 3:53:10.600]  russian government funded but go look this up putin one of the reasons they hate him is he is
[3:53:10.600 --> 3:53:17.480]  in favor of for instance pro family he's pro christianity all the things that were gone
[3:53:17.480 --> 3:53:23.800]  during the soviet union era and that were also gone in the 90s when these oligarchs were ruling
[3:53:23.800 --> 3:53:29.480]  russia so there's a lot of reasons they're trying to go after putin but the big reason is he stopped
[3:53:29.480 --> 3:53:36.040]  larry summers he stopped bill clinton he stopped soros all of these guys from stealing assets from
[3:53:36.040 --> 3:53:44.280]  russia they were trying to steal the oil assets now let's go to 2013 right now hillary clinton's
[3:53:44.280 --> 3:53:49.720]  in place bill bill clinton's wife hillary clinton is in place she sets up a program and you can
[3:53:49.720 --> 3:53:58.360]  look it up called civil society 2.0 civil society 2.0 was a way of training activists and it caused
[3:53:58.360 --> 3:54:07.480]  two things to happen number one the air of spring number two this madan coup in ukraine that started
[3:54:07.480 --> 3:54:16.360]  in 2013 and ended in february 2014 this whole madan coup was a setup by soros and the clinton's
[3:54:16.360 --> 3:54:22.440]  and the clinton state department and a woman named victoria newland now again i mentioned her
[3:54:22.440 --> 3:54:29.880]  she was being updated by christopher steele why christopher steele got his start at the state
[3:54:29.880 --> 3:54:37.080]  department remember former british asian then he's hooked up through a guy named jonathan weiner
[3:54:37.080 --> 3:54:43.080]  state department official worked for jon carry for a long time he is hooked up with the state
[3:54:43.080 --> 3:54:49.880]  department and victoria newland and both victoria newland and jonathan weiner have admitted on
[3:54:49.880 --> 3:54:55.320]  video you can find it out there it's in the it's in the papers but it's hardly reported that they
[3:54:55.320 --> 3:55:03.000]  were being updated by christopher steele during the 2016 election this is where they created russia
[3:55:03.000 --> 3:55:08.840]  gate this is where they did it and one of the ways they did it was with a ukrainian american
[3:55:08.840 --> 3:55:14.600]  operative and that's what that politico story is about a woman named alexander chalupa now that's
[3:55:14.600 --> 3:55:19.400]  a name you're going to start to hear quite a bit about because people like mark meadows
[3:55:19.400 --> 3:55:27.720]  are on to chalupa and so is bar because they started to investigate and she's admitted she's
[3:55:27.720 --> 3:55:34.520]  out there saying she's the one responsible for paul maniforte going down you see chalupa hated
[3:55:34.520 --> 3:55:42.040]  maniforte back to 2015 she hated maniforte and in 2015 before trump even announced she was trying
[3:55:42.040 --> 3:55:49.160]  to get maniforte now you got to mention one thing about maniforte and this is a lie perpetrated
[3:55:49.160 --> 3:55:55.720]  by the media maniforte's not pro russia maniforte was actually trying to get the ukraine to get
[3:55:55.720 --> 3:56:03.640]  closer to the eu and not russia so why alexander chalupa was going after him is a mystery but
[3:56:03.640 --> 3:56:10.520]  here's what we know alexander chalupa worked in the clinton whitehouse she was a democratic operative
[3:56:10.520 --> 3:56:17.160]  for about 12 years this is no one's denying any of this and she went to the ukrainian embassy
[3:56:17.160 --> 3:56:27.400]  in the spring of 2016 before the hack this hack even happened at the dnc and she told them i want
[3:56:27.400 --> 3:56:35.080]  dirt on trump she told them don't coordinate with the trump campaign and she told them and this is
[3:56:35.080 --> 3:56:41.960]  really significant she also told them that the democrats plan to have hearings about trump
[3:56:41.960 --> 3:56:51.320]  and russia through marsy kapoor the ohio congresswoman right before the election so this entire trump
[3:56:51.320 --> 3:56:57.640]  russia russia gate narrative was ginned up by democrats and part of the reason is they wanted
[3:56:57.640 --> 3:57:04.040]  to hide what they did in ukraine what i'm getting at here is the hunter biden aspect of this while
[3:57:04.040 --> 3:57:09.400]  true and while significant is not the most significant thing the most significant thing
[3:57:09.400 --> 3:57:14.920]  is that the u.s. overthrew the democratically elected government then using the people we
[3:57:14.920 --> 3:57:21.640]  put in power our government your tax dollars they tried to throw the election and take trump out
[3:57:21.640 --> 3:57:27.560]  again do me a favor go to populist.tv i got a podcast coming out about this it's completely free
[3:57:27.560 --> 3:57:32.040]  you can sign up for that i really once again want to thank alex and everyone in info wars
[3:57:32.040 --> 3:57:37.480]  for let me talk to you about some of this stuff do me a favor look all this stuff up yourself
[3:57:37.480 --> 3:57:44.200]  you'll be stunned this is deeper than you can possibly imagine
