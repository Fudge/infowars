[00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:27.732]  We are truly tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:27.732 --> 00:00:48.978]  It was Friday that we began to report that Japan was pulling millions and millions of injections or doses of Moderna's mRNA gene therapy injection because they were finding liquid magnetic nanoparticles that had been made industrially in all of the shots.
[00:00:48.978 --> 00:00:52.199]  And these were made by Moderna, which is DARPA,
[00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.102]  And Bill Gates in Madrid, Spain.
[00:00:56.102 --> 00:01:02.727]  It looks like they added more metal than they were supposed to because it started killing a bunch of people.
[00:01:02.727 --> 00:01:06.350]  And then the Japanese government at first tried to cover it up that it was so big they couldn't.
[00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.631]  This has been happening the last few weeks.
[00:01:08.631 --> 00:01:09.992]  So they pulled him in Tokyo.
[00:01:09.992 --> 00:01:17.538]  They pulled him in a bunch of other cities and found that basically all of the doses that they tested and looked at have the metallic.
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.720]  Systems added to it.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:28.904]  Now, we started telling everybody when they started the injections in England that people were complaining of becoming magnetic.
[00:01:28.904 --> 00:01:32.705]  And then you saw it demonstrated by medical doctors in Mexico and Italy and the U.S.
[00:01:32.705 --> 00:01:35.126]  and Canada and Germany.
[00:01:35.126 --> 00:01:37.447]  Well, now it's in Reuters.
[00:01:37.447 --> 00:01:40.448]  So it's not in the big Tokyo newspaper like it was last week.
[00:01:40.448 --> 00:01:43.309]  It's not in the Okinawa newspaper.
[00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:46.110]  People just ignored that and said, oh, no, it's fake news.
[00:01:47.398 --> 00:01:49.399]  You try to post it on Twitter, they would remove it.
[00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.679]  But you're not allowed to warn the people.
[00:01:52.679 --> 00:02:02.762]  Well, now it's in Reuters and it's in the Associated Press and they just don't know what to do.
[00:02:02.762 --> 00:02:04.182]  Here's some of the headlines.
[00:02:04.182 --> 00:02:10.984]  Japan halts 2.6 million Moderna doses after additional vials found to contain foreign substances.
[00:02:10.984 --> 00:02:12.525]  An extra two men die.
[00:02:12.525 --> 00:02:16.986]  And when you read the actual Japanese local articles, there's deaths in every town from this.
[00:02:18.618 --> 00:02:21.519]  And yes, they're magnetic.
[00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.440]  Continuing, here's Reuters.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.763]  Contaminant in Moderna vaccines suspected to be metallic particles.
[00:02:29.763 --> 00:02:33.045]  And that's the national government coming out and saying that.
[00:02:33.045 --> 00:02:35.366]  You try to put this on Twitter?
[00:02:35.366 --> 00:02:39.548]  They're even removing Reuters, because they're a depopulation movement.
[00:02:39.548 --> 00:02:41.909]  They're a cult, and I'm going to show you where they brag about that in a moment.
[00:02:42.694 --> 00:02:45.656]  So, Facebook, all of them are embedded.
[00:02:45.656 --> 00:02:48.237]  Zuckerberg's invested in the Wuhan lab.
[00:02:48.237 --> 00:02:50.158]  They are all part of this criminal assault.
[00:02:50.158 --> 00:02:53.160]  They believe they've saved the Earth by depopulating us.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.142]  And if we don't stand up to them, we kind of deserve it, don't we?
[00:02:56.142 --> 00:03:01.605]  Contaminants in Moderna vaccines are suspected to be metallic particles.
[00:03:01.605 --> 00:03:03.506]  NHK, Reuters.
[00:03:03.506 --> 00:03:08.709]  So put that in your pipe, ladies and gentlemen, and smoke it.
[00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.470]  And show that to all the detractors out there.
[00:03:11.377 --> 00:03:11.977]  Here's another one.
[00:03:11.977 --> 00:03:17.600]  Moderna vaccine production continues in EU amid contamination probe Reuters.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.401]  And they're still injecting people with it all over the world.
[00:03:20.401 --> 00:03:24.123]  But the Japanese government says no, no, no.
[00:03:24.123 --> 00:03:24.883]  Here's another headline.
[00:03:24.883 --> 00:03:29.965]  People got suspended from Twitter a few months ago for saying that it had medical particles in it.
[00:03:29.965 --> 00:03:32.627]  Suspended permanently.
[00:03:32.627 --> 00:03:33.287]  Hate to say it.
[00:03:35.267 --> 00:03:37.747]  But the seed man was right again.
[00:03:37.747 --> 00:03:38.648]  Alex Jones.
[00:03:38.648 --> 00:03:39.428]  Whatever that means.
[00:03:39.428 --> 00:03:41.808]  That's all over Twitter and Facebook.
[00:03:41.808 --> 00:03:42.128]  Everywhere.
[00:03:42.128 --> 00:03:42.908]  Alex Jones is right.
[00:03:42.908 --> 00:03:43.609]  Alex Jones is right.
[00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.189]  It's like spray-painted all over the country.
[00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:49.049]  They really don't like that, do they?
[00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.890]  Meanwhile, they did not approve the Moderna and COVID injections.
[00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.111]  They did not approve the Pfizer.
[00:03:56.111 --> 00:04:00.171]  They simply said we're reauthorizing its emergency authorization.
[00:04:00.171 --> 00:04:01.172]  We'll release studies in 2025.
[00:04:01.172 --> 00:04:01.292]  Maybe.
[00:04:06.667 --> 00:04:09.069]  Everyone's saying, oh, it's totally tested, it's totally safe.
[00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.991]  That's why the Pentagon's moving forward against the troops with it.
[00:04:11.991 --> 00:04:13.393]  This is an assault.
[00:04:13.393 --> 00:04:16.335]  The Pentagon's run by globalists that are destroying the country.
[00:04:16.335 --> 00:04:17.876]  Do you understand?
[00:04:17.876 --> 00:04:26.763]  Just like the French fell in two weeks to the Germans when the French fought the Germans and lost the most troops in World War I but beat them.
[00:04:26.763 --> 00:04:28.845]  And it's because they bought off 90% of the high command.
[00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:40.832]  Hitler did so that the French military stood down, and that's why they moved the capital of France to Vichy France in the south.
[00:04:40.832 --> 00:04:41.693]  That's historical.
[00:04:41.693 --> 00:04:43.153]  It's the same thing here.
[00:04:43.153 --> 00:04:51.177]  The globalists bought off our military and the intelligence agencies, and they're now carrying out bio-warfare on us for China.
[00:04:51.177 --> 00:04:53.098]  That's a fact.
[00:04:53.098 --> 00:04:55.079]  And Congress is too stupid to figure it out.
[00:04:58.737 --> 00:05:00.238]  I'm not funded by George Soros.
[00:05:00.238 --> 00:05:02.199]  I'm not funded by the Democratic Party.
[00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:03.399]  I'm funded by you.
[00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:04.560]  We got great products you need.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.801]  We got great stuff for your immune system and your body.
[00:05:06.801 --> 00:05:14.264]  And just stuff that's essential for general health, like Vitamin Mineral Fusion, all the vitamins, all the minerals, and all the key amino acids for adults, children, old folks.
[00:05:14.264 --> 00:05:17.365]  You absorb more of it than pills because it's liquid form and it tastes great.
[00:05:17.365 --> 00:05:18.686]  Ready to ship to you now.
[00:05:19.326 --> 00:05:19.906]  We're good to go.
[00:05:34.554 --> 00:05:39.796]  Iodine, it's discounted, and pure turmeric formula, the liquid extract as well, it's discounted at Back in Stock.
[00:05:39.796 --> 00:05:46.639]  Activated charcoal toothpaste and activated charcoal toothpaste mouthwash with all the essential oils, those are 33% off as well.
[00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:51.740]  You can call toll free, 888-253-3139, or you can go to InfoWorksStore.com.
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:58.323]  We've got a lot of great other products on the site as well, so be sure and check those out today!
[00:06:06.634 --> 00:06:19.016]  And now the end is near, and so I face the final curtain.
[00:06:19.016 --> 00:06:31.699]  My friend, I'll say it clear, I'll state my case, of which I'm certain.
[00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:32.639]  I've lived
[00:06:34.116 --> 00:06:38.538]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:06:38.538 --> 00:06:42.319]  It's August 31st, 2021 on this Tuesday broadcast.
[00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:45.340]  Thank you Blue Eyes for bringing us in.
[00:06:58.527 --> 00:07:01.268]  Well, it's all out in the open now, isn't it?
[00:07:01.268 --> 00:07:02.588]  All the games are over.
[00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:07.390]  You're getting to see the Globalist attack plan that I've been so desperate to stop.
[00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.411]  Now they've launched it.
[00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:13.132]  Now would you like to know what's coming next?
[00:07:13.132 --> 00:07:16.993]  If people will just simply listen to me and check the documents, we can stop them.
[00:07:16.993 --> 00:07:23.296]  It's all run by the Rockefeller Foundation through Bill Gates.
[00:07:23.296 --> 00:07:25.976]  It is a planned operation.
[00:07:25.976 --> 00:07:27.257]  And they are doing it their way.
[00:07:29.073 --> 00:07:35.878]  And it's time for us to realize that and become aware of the type of new war we're in or we have no future.
[00:07:35.878 --> 00:07:37.199]  And maybe you don't want to rise to the challenge.
[00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:39.561]  Maybe you want to roll over and die.
[00:07:39.561 --> 00:07:43.043]  But as for me, I'm not going to roll over and die.
[00:07:43.043 --> 00:07:45.185]  I'm going to stop the globalists with God's help and your help.
[00:07:45.185 --> 00:07:47.927]  We're going to do it together.
[00:07:47.927 --> 00:07:50.188]  All right, let me just hit it for you right now.
[00:07:53.152 --> 00:07:56.793]  They have to kill us under their globalist plan for their God.
[00:07:56.793 --> 00:08:01.354]  They believe they're about to get life extension technologies and there's too many of us and that's their operation.
[00:08:01.354 --> 00:08:05.795]  It's the perfect excuse for them to play God.
[00:08:05.795 --> 00:08:12.736]  And there gets to a point where you can't just do to ski experiments over here and radiation experiments there and kill a few thousand here, a few thousand there.
[00:08:12.736 --> 00:08:18.038]  Or have a war and kill a few million here, a few million there.
[00:08:18.038 --> 00:08:19.298]  You really want to depopulate
[00:08:20.529 --> 00:08:34.062]  You've got to go ahead and release a bioweapon with plausible deniability and then have the response to the bioweapon be a binary system that connects with the virus and then basically starts wiping people out en masse.
[00:08:34.062 --> 00:08:41.750]  Then you blame the unvaccinated despite all the statistics showing it is the vaccinated and a large enough percentage of the public
[00:08:42.745 --> 00:09:00.333]  will not be able to admit that the social contract is broken and that the globalists are at war with them and they will then turn against their fellow humans and ally themselves with the establishment believing that the prosperity will just come back if they simply submit to the globalist program.
[00:09:00.333 --> 00:09:06.336]  Even though Klaus Schwab and Boris Johnson
[00:09:07.955 --> 00:09:25.526]  And Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and Merkel and all the former and current puppets are all calling for a post-industrial world global carbon tax and are now saying the lockdowns of COVID were just a test.
[00:09:25.526 --> 00:09:29.589]  Now we're going to lock you down for the climate.
[00:09:29.589 --> 00:09:37.214]  There's a new Justin Trudeau video of him saying what we did with COVID
[00:09:39.045 --> 00:09:39.705]  Is a model.
[00:09:39.705 --> 00:09:40.045]  Here it is.
[00:09:40.045 --> 00:09:40.606]  There's a quote.
[00:10:09.445 --> 00:10:12.067]  And that's what's coming here.
[00:10:12.067 --> 00:10:18.271]  Being implemented through the corporations, through the hotel chains, through OpenTable, through all of it.
[00:10:18.271 --> 00:10:30.639]  And of course, they now announce, Fauci announced yesterday, the Australians announced yesterday, the UN announced yesterday, you're gonna get shots every five to six months on a digital app.
[00:10:30.639 --> 00:10:37.524]  The UN has released the new program for the UN-approved world government app.
[00:10:38.567 --> 00:10:41.970]  Run by the Rockefeller Foundation and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:46.933]  It actually says it.
[00:10:46.933 --> 00:10:55.119]  Who has published the guidance document for countries implementing partners on the introduction of digital vaccine certificates?
[00:10:55.119 --> 00:11:02.505]  Dubbed DDCCVS, the work was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation, amongst others.
[00:11:02.505 --> 00:11:04.987]  And I'm going to show you the document here today.
[00:11:06.203 --> 00:11:19.052]  Remember all those years ago, I said the Rockefeller Foundation runs it all, and now they officially run the global response of the UN, the US, and everybody else to how everything's done.
[00:11:19.052 --> 00:11:27.719]  And the plan of the Rockefeller Foundation has been and is depopulation.
[00:11:27.719 --> 00:11:32.803]  Basically, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute was founded by a $25 million grant
[00:11:36.547 --> 00:11:42.270]  More than a hundred years ago, by the Cold Springs Harbor Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:46.673]  If you don't know what Cold Springs Harbor is, you might want to find out.
[00:11:46.673 --> 00:11:51.996]  But Hitler was birthed by the Rockefellers.
[00:11:51.996 --> 00:11:56.198]  The UN came out from between the legs of the Rockefellers.
[00:11:56.198 --> 00:12:02.762]  The IMF, the World Bank, everything you see.
[00:12:02.762 --> 00:12:04.683]  John D. the First.
[00:12:08.371 --> 00:12:12.374]  A vowed Luciferian.
[00:12:12.374 --> 00:12:15.597]  On record.
[00:12:15.597 --> 00:12:19.400]  Working for the devil.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.823]  Overtime.
[00:12:22.823 --> 00:12:24.984]  It's his world.
[00:12:24.984 --> 00:12:25.685]  It's his way.
[00:12:25.685 --> 00:12:30.309]  I want to go to an extremely important Gregory's Report.
[00:12:32.773 --> 00:12:38.650]  Pfizer demanded military bases as collateral for cost of vaccine deaths.
[00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:39.432]  Bet you didn't know that.
[00:12:39.432 --> 00:12:39.733]  Here it is.
[00:12:47.463 --> 00:12:57.008]  A story from this spring is re-emerging of why Argentina and Brazil never made a deal with Pfizer for the experimental jab.
[00:12:57.008 --> 00:13:06.733]  In Argentina, Pfizer requested that the government pay all compensation for any lawsuits that successfully win against Pfizer vaccine damages.
[00:13:06.733 --> 00:13:14.377]  Argentina's parliament responded by passing a new law stating that Pfizer needs to at least pay for its own negligence.
[00:13:15.177 --> 00:13:27.713]  Pfizer rejected this, after which Argentina offered to amend the law to define negligence more clearly, to include only vaccine distribution and delivery under negligence.
[00:13:27.713 --> 00:13:31.458]  But Pfizer still wasn't happy and demanded the law be changed.
[00:13:32.199 --> 00:13:40.964]  Argentina refused, but later agreed to buy an international insurance policy to pay for future vaccine lawsuits.
[00:13:40.964 --> 00:13:43.705]  This was not specific enough for Pfizer.
[00:13:43.705 --> 00:13:57.513]  They asked for an additional indemnity from civil cases, specifically that the company would not be held liable for rare adverse effects or for its own acts of negligence, fraud, or malice.
[00:13:58.533 --> 00:14:08.659]  Pfizer then demanded the nation's bank reserves, military bases, and embassy buildings as some sort of collateral against future vaccine damages.
[00:14:08.659 --> 00:14:21.247]  In Brazil, Pfizer asked for vast money reserves to be put in a foreign bank account, that Pfizer be exempt from the law of the land, and exempt from any side effects and all civil liability.
[00:14:22.569 --> 00:14:35.213]  In the United States, the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, or PREP Act, gives total immunity to Pfizer and all manufacturers of experimental jabs.
[00:14:35.213 --> 00:14:38.834]  So there's no reason to threaten any government agency in the U.S.
[00:14:39.847 --> 00:14:46.753]  They always knew how dangerous and deadly the radical experimental mRNA jabs actually are.
[00:14:46.753 --> 00:14:49.155]  It's what the science says.
[00:14:49.155 --> 00:14:55.881]  The only ones who say otherwise are the bureaucrats and pop culture media agents working for Big Pharma.
[00:14:56.582 --> 00:15:03.047]  By every measure, this is the greatest crime committed by Big Pharma, out of a long list.
[00:15:03.047 --> 00:15:07.970]  Their magnum opus for the dark arts, death and depopulation.
[00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:16.656]  And they were setting up governments to take the fall, so that the bankers can have their great reset, without any resistance.
[00:15:16.656 --> 00:15:18.858]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:15:24.218 --> 00:15:28.163]  Alright folks, you can find the report as the featured video at Band.Video.
[00:15:28.163 --> 00:15:33.910]  Pfizer demands military bases as collateral on cost of vaccine deaths.
[00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:37.374]  It's all part of a systematic plan.
[00:15:38.752 --> 00:15:44.158]  And they are now admitting publicly they're preparing the new climate lockdowns.
[00:15:44.158 --> 00:15:47.402]  That's why they have the police beating and attacking everyone worldwide.
[00:15:47.402 --> 00:15:55.412]  This is a savage, sinister takeover designed to collapse the world economy and trigger mass starvation and death of billions.
[00:15:55.412 --> 00:15:57.334]  Huge wars, race war, total death.
[00:15:57.614 --> 00:16:06.039]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[00:16:06.039 --> 00:16:07.059]  Here's why.
[00:16:07.059 --> 00:16:10.981]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[00:16:10.981 --> 00:16:16.104]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[00:16:16.104 --> 00:16:24.529]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[00:16:25.089 --> 00:16:33.085]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:16:33.783 --> 00:16:39.865]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too!

[00:17:06.793 --> 00:17:11.097]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans.
[00:17:11.097 --> 00:17:12.058]  Survival soup beans.

[00:17:20.641 --> 00:17:21.741]  The best part?

[00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:03.412]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[00:18:03.412 --> 00:18:05.473]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[00:18:05.473 --> 00:18:10.935]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[00:18:10.935 --> 00:18:12.055]  But we failed.
[00:18:12.055 --> 00:18:13.716]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[00:18:13.716 --> 00:18:15.577]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed.
[00:18:15.577 --> 00:18:20.639]  But they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization Great Reset.
[00:18:21.579 --> 00:18:30.502]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[00:18:30.502 --> 00:18:35.704]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[00:18:35.704 --> 00:18:38.605]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storable food.
[00:18:38.605 --> 00:18:43.366]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarestore.com.

[00:19:38.403 --> 00:19:40.803]  Everybody, I don't know if you've seen our bed infomercial.
[00:19:40.803 --> 00:19:42.744]  I developed this bed over a year and a half.
[00:19:42.744 --> 00:19:44.584]  Best mattress you'll ever sleep on.
[00:19:44.584 --> 00:19:47.205]  It's a combination of coils and patented foam.
[00:19:47.205 --> 00:19:48.505]  And this, they're amazing.
[00:19:48.505 --> 00:19:49.346]  There's nothing better.
[00:19:49.346 --> 00:19:49.846]  When I made it.
[00:19:50.927 --> 00:19:55.114]  The cost is not high and you support freedom by pillow.com promo code Alex.

[00:20:01.705 --> 00:20:04.309]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:29.404]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:29.404 --> 00:20:38.992]  Alright, my friends, I intend to open the phones up in the second hour today, so that listeners can tell their stories.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:45.243]  About being in-country in Afghanistan and what you think of the pullout and what's really behind it.
[00:20:45.243 --> 00:20:47.764]  That's one area we're opening the phones up on.
[00:20:47.764 --> 00:20:57.070]  The other area is what you've seen with your friends, your family, your neighbors, your co-workers with these so-called COVID vaccines and your eyewitness reports.
[00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:00.932]  No one has called in yet to say they like the system.
[00:21:00.932 --> 00:21:06.836]  Nobody has called in yet to say that it was a great thing.
[00:21:13.001 --> 00:21:25.913]  So that's all coming up here today in the second hour here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:21:25.913 --> 00:21:32.458]  But let me just right now talk about solutions and things that are positive.
[00:21:32.458 --> 00:21:34.640]  Last year, we looked at the statistics and the numbers.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.162]  The hospitals were basically empty.
[00:21:38.459 --> 00:21:46.722]  They were saying people that died of gunshot wounds and car wrecks and regular flu and pneumonia and cancer and heart attacks as COVID.
[00:21:46.722 --> 00:21:49.022]  I just reported the facts.
[00:21:49.022 --> 00:21:58.605]  We had all sorts of investigative journalists on that went to hospitals around the world to show that indeed they were basically empty.
[00:21:58.605 --> 00:22:06.428]  Then starting about three and a half months ago, I began to see a lot of people get really sick, a lot of people have trouble breathing, and a lot of people die at the hospital.
[00:22:07.267 --> 00:22:10.489]  And in many cases, they weren't even saying they had COVID.
[00:22:10.489 --> 00:22:16.172]  They were saying that it was all these new weird, quote, viruses that had popped up clearly from the shedding.
[00:22:16.172 --> 00:22:20.594]  And the medical literature actually shows all of that.
[00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:32.954]  And so now the media spins it that, oh, Alex Jones, you know, has said COVID wasn't real, and Alex Jones said it was all a hoax, and now he's eating crow.
[00:22:32.954 --> 00:22:34.955]  Look, there's all these deaths, yay!
[00:22:34.955 --> 00:22:41.478]  Why, look, three conservative talk show hosts, yeah, there are thousands of them, have died.
[00:22:41.478 --> 00:22:46.380]  And the young Turks, everybody, you know, make jokes about it.
[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:49.862]  I've been saying for over three months that this is serious and this is real.
[00:22:51.055 --> 00:22:56.680]  My family didn't test positive for COVID, but they thought they had like a gorilla sitting on their chest.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.442]  And it sure fit all the symptoms.
[00:22:58.442 --> 00:23:00.824]  And they lost their smell.
[00:23:00.824 --> 00:23:03.066]  And almost everybody else I know has been sick.
[00:23:03.066 --> 00:23:06.850]  And I know a lot of folks have died, especially in Texas and Florida.
[00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:14.938]  And a lot of the insiders I talked to said that they're bombarding us specifically with nanoparticles in these states, and that it isn't even COVID.
[00:23:14.938 --> 00:23:16.279]  That's why it doesn't come up as COVID.
[00:23:19.505 --> 00:23:32.771]  And the very same groups then work around the clock to suppress Ivermectin, Regeneron, and other treatments that are 100% if you catch somebody early.
[00:23:32.771 --> 00:23:35.733]  I know, no exaggeration, 50 people
[00:23:37.304 --> 00:23:45.270]  That had a headache, then had a chest cold, and within two days thought, again, a giant gorilla was sitting on their chest.
[00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:47.772]  They go to the hospital, they wouldn't give them any help.
[00:23:47.772 --> 00:23:59.060]  I got a hold of medical doctors and others, got them prescriptions for ivermectin and all the rest of it, and within a day of them taking it, they all turned around and were better in a few days.
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.762]  So I've experienced it, and that's why I'm so angry now.
[00:24:02.543 --> 00:24:08.768]  Because I didn't just hear about Ivermectin or the Japanese government saying it works 100% or the whole history of it.
[00:24:08.768 --> 00:24:12.451]  I've witnessed it for myself and I'm really angry now.
[00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:13.552]  So let's save some lives.
[00:24:13.552 --> 00:24:14.953]  Let's warn some people.
[00:24:14.953 --> 00:24:15.994]  Let's take action now.
[00:24:15.994 --> 00:24:19.257]  Go to Bandod Video and go to the John Bounds section.
[00:24:19.257 --> 00:24:23.781]  We'll also post this to the front page of InfoWars.com and share this video.
[00:24:23.781 --> 00:24:25.782]  The vilification of Ivermectin.
[00:24:25.782 --> 00:24:27.183]  Let's save some lives together.
[00:24:27.183 --> 00:24:27.544]  Here it is.
[00:24:28.835 --> 00:24:36.120]  Ivermectin is an early treatment drug with a high rate of effectiveness in studies against COVID-19.
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:50.350]  According to c19ivermectin.com, meta-analysis using the most serious outcome reported shows 72% and 86% improvement for early treatment and prophylaxis.
[00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:58.276]  Statistically, significant improvements are seen for mortality, hospitalization, recovery, cases and viral clearance.
[00:24:58.876 --> 00:25:03.780]  27 studies show statistically significant improvements in isolation.
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:13.747]  The probability that an ineffective treatment generated results as positive as the 63 studies is estimated to be 1 in 1 trillion.
[00:25:13.747 --> 00:25:19.391]  Like many drugs, ivermectin comes in doses for human and animal consumption.
[00:25:19.611 --> 00:25:28.996]  But according to the frontline COVID-19 critical care alliance, for prevention and early treatment, the amount of ivermectin taken is a tiny amount.
[00:25:28.996 --> 00:25:47.987]  But as the vaccine industry stands to make billions more from a booster regime for the COVID boogeyman that has a recovery rate on average of 99%, and a media industry that feeds off the pharmaceutical industry with countless hours of advertising, the propaganda against ivermectin has been unrelenting.
[00:25:48.667 --> 00:25:52.591]  Well, a new false cure for COVID in high demand.
[00:25:52.591 --> 00:26:05.762]  Ivermectin, a drug most commonly used to deworm large animals like horses, is selling out, with many people turning to a pro-Trump telemedicine website with hopes to get it.
[00:26:05.762 --> 00:26:08.425]  An adult drank an injectable.
[00:26:09.125 --> 00:26:13.167]  Ivermectin formulation intended for use in cattle.
[00:26:13.167 --> 00:26:25.852]  In an attempt to prevent COVID-19 infection, this patient presented to a hospital with confusion, drowsiness, visual hallucinations, tachypnea, which is rapid breathing, also tremors.
[00:26:25.852 --> 00:26:30.094]  The patient recovered after being hospitalized for nine days.
[00:26:30.094 --> 00:26:32.375]  Nine days!
[00:26:32.375 --> 00:26:33.656]  Nine days in the hospital.
[00:26:35.094 --> 00:26:42.039]  Drinking injectable ivermectin formulated as an injection that you would shoot into a cow.
[00:26:42.039 --> 00:26:49.504]  I gotta say, when I first heard that Fox News was pushing ivermectin, I knew it was going to be bad, but I was not expecting it to be horse dewormer.
[00:26:49.504 --> 00:26:54.148]  Sounds like the name of a drug they give super soldiers in a Paul Verhoeven movie to turn them into robocops.
[00:26:54.148 --> 00:26:58.411]  You know someone at the company that made ivermectin once said, hey, should we put not for people on the horse pill labels?
[00:26:58.411 --> 00:27:01.673]  And someone else said, there's a picture of a horse on the bottle.
[00:27:01.673 --> 00:27:02.374]  It's fine.
[00:27:02.814 --> 00:27:13.707]  Of course, far from the slime permeated from television are doctors rather than failed late-night talk show hosts presenting studies backed up by the threat of malpractice.
[00:27:13.707 --> 00:27:20.035]  Trials conducted across the developing world have also revealed ivermectin to be an effective treatment for COVID-19.
[00:27:20.976 --> 00:27:25.237]  Reducing symptoms, cutting mortality by up to 75%.
[00:27:25.237 --> 00:27:41.022]  But as the virus mutates into more lethal strains and as concerns grow that vaccines alone may not be the long-term answer, so interest is building in ivermectin with its potential to be both prevention and cure.
[00:27:41.022 --> 00:27:45.923]  So much so that researchers at Oxford University are conducting a trial of their own.
[00:27:46.543 --> 00:27:55.028]  Although we're hopeful that vaccines are going to do what's promised, the data is not very reassuring that they're actually going to achieve everything that they're setting out to achieve.
[00:27:55.028 --> 00:27:59.170]  But if they don't, we'll have another tool as a backup.
[00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:02.812]  And as one that we can deploy now while waiting for the vaccines, right?
[00:28:02.812 --> 00:28:06.834]  There's huge portions of the world which don't have anything available to protect them or to treat them.
[00:28:07.034 --> 00:28:20.388]  From the perspective of the psychotic elite planners, the great reset war on humanity using the COVID-19 gain-of-function bioweapon to slowly reduce population must not be derailed.
[00:28:20.388 --> 00:28:26.214]  They're trying to block vitamin D in the news, vitamin C, hydroxychloroquine, now ivermectin.
[00:28:26.214 --> 00:28:27.636]  And there's another legal
[00:28:27.896 --> 00:28:28.456]  We're good to go.
[00:28:50.603 --> 00:28:57.789]  Have the government doing the emergency authorizations if there are any, any one effective treatment.
[00:28:57.789 --> 00:29:01.812]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[00:29:01.812 --> 00:29:02.573]  Me too.
[00:29:02.573 --> 00:29:09.699]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[00:29:09.699 --> 00:29:13.682]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[00:29:14.062 --> 00:29:15.963]  You probably already believe that.
[00:29:15.963 --> 00:29:16.983]  I certainly do.
[00:29:16.983 --> 00:29:17.924]  So here's the thing.
[00:29:17.924 --> 00:29:26.807]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[00:29:26.807 --> 00:29:32.249]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.
[00:29:32.249 --> 00:29:33.310]  No cures or treatments there.

[00:29:58.587 --> 00:30:14.813]  In late August, Infowars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.

[00:31:58.843 --> 00:32:02.584]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[00:32:02.584 --> 00:32:06.304]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[00:32:06.304 --> 00:32:13.946]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck, the big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[00:32:13.946 --> 00:32:19.707]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local station you're listening to as well.

[00:32:31.913 --> 00:32:34.054]  I need your help more than ever now.
[00:32:34.054 --> 00:32:38.178]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.

[00:32:58.317 --> 00:33:01.160]  Thank you so much.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.764]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:21.975 --> 00:33:35.244]  So Bill Gates and the globalists say they want to depopulate us, and we've got a bunch of big breaking news on that front next segment.
[00:33:35.244 --> 00:33:44.531]  And they go and they buy up and get control of all the major national and local health departments of the world, and then they roll out a virus to create fear, they create a
[00:33:45.578 --> 00:33:49.799]  Biological therapy that actually makes people sick and lowers their immune system.
[00:33:49.799 --> 00:34:01.982]  And because they own the big media and big tech, they're able to suppress communications and try to keep the public from learning about the fact that they actually launched the attack themselves, with the Chi-Coms, for global domination.
[00:34:01.982 --> 00:34:09.303]  And they even wrote white papers at the Rockefeller Foundation, called Operation Lockstep, laying out the battle plan.
[00:34:09.303 --> 00:34:12.164]  But then, out of Japan, where they invented it for humans,
[00:34:13.277 --> 00:34:29.185]  And out of Africa, where most of the government's handed out to their populations, they found it's also a great antiviral, ivermectin emerges, just like hydroxychloroquine and other things, and the media tries to ignore it and or attack it.
[00:34:29.185 --> 00:34:40.050]  This is such an important report by John Boehm, the vilification of ivermectin, because it shows Rachel Maddow and all these teleprompter readers going, it's ridiculous!
[00:34:42.995 --> 00:34:57.621]  People went to the hospital and they were real sick from injecting cow medicine that's injectable, and so they drank it.
[00:34:57.621 --> 00:35:08.706]  Well, I worked for a large animal vet, but anybody can go to Tractor Supply or any other place and buy ivermectin for horses and cows, and it looks like a tube of caulk.
[00:35:09.508 --> 00:35:10.669]  Or putty.
[00:35:10.669 --> 00:35:13.670]  It's not an injector as a needle.
[00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:18.372]  It's an injector into the mouth.
[00:35:18.372 --> 00:35:23.694]  So that just like you can, when you're giving a child antibiotics, it has a little plastic injector.
[00:35:23.694 --> 00:35:27.516]  You slurp it up out of the bottle and then squirt it into their mouth.
[00:35:27.516 --> 00:35:29.256]  So again, they tried to make it just sound crazy.
[00:35:29.256 --> 00:35:32.118]  Like they're taking an injectable thing.
[00:35:32.118 --> 00:35:34.839]  You inject like a needle and they're drinking it.
[00:35:34.839 --> 00:35:37.180]  It's the exact same molecule.
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:42.983]  As the Ivermectin capsules that you get from a doctor.
[00:35:42.983 --> 00:35:50.728]  And again, I can show you the head of the Tokyo Medical Association saying we have over 10,000 patients, 100% cure rate if caught early.
[00:35:50.728 --> 00:35:52.569]  Then they show the statistics out of Africa.
[00:35:52.569 --> 00:35:56.391]  Countries that get out Ivermectin twice a year versus countries that don't.
[00:35:56.391 --> 00:36:00.614]  India has a super low death rate and problem rate now because they're handing out Ivermectin.
[00:36:00.614 --> 00:36:06.958]  I've got all the reports and I've got Oxford University and all these big universities going, no actually Ivermectin's amazing.
[00:36:08.985 --> 00:36:16.330]  But Rachel Maddow and the Young Turks and all them, when they are attacking me by name, Jones is a kook!
[00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:21.193]  He's telling his followers, go take dewormer paste!
[00:36:21.193 --> 00:36:24.395]  That's one thing ivermectin does.
[00:36:24.395 --> 00:36:37.524]  And I've sat there with cows, over a thousand of them in one day, it's an exhausting job, where you run them into chutes, put them in a squeeze chute so that you can control them, and you put tongs in their nose, and you tie up their face,
[00:36:39.261 --> 00:37:02.387]  Tongs in the nose to hold them, you tie it up on the bar, and then you take the ivermectin dose, usually about three doses per container, and you stick the plastic tube in their mouth, doesn't hurt them, and you inject into their mouth, not into their body, into their mouth, the ivermectin dose.
[00:37:02.387 --> 00:37:07.228]  And then you throw it in a trash can, and you let that cow out, and they run the next cow in.
[00:37:08.888 --> 00:37:12.712]  My job's been running them into the pen with a cattle prod.
[00:37:12.712 --> 00:37:14.854]  My job's been running the squeeze chute.
[00:37:14.854 --> 00:37:18.297]  My job's been clamping their head down and giving them the medicine.
[00:37:18.297 --> 00:37:29.368]  I know, Maddow, but anybody can go read the case of it at the farm supply place or at the veterinary supply place.
[00:37:29.368 --> 00:37:31.109]  You can read on the side how you do it.
[00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:33.352]  You do not inject it into their body.
[00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:38.195]  So people that are taking it are taking it the right way into their mouths.
[00:37:38.195 --> 00:37:39.316]  But they know that.
[00:37:39.316 --> 00:37:45.104]  They lie at every level because we are their enemies.
[00:37:45.104 --> 00:37:46.326]  And they want you dead.
[00:37:46.326 --> 00:37:47.567]  They think there's too many people.
[00:37:47.567 --> 00:37:50.111]  They want the planet for themselves.
[00:37:50.111 --> 00:37:51.453]  They are depopulationists.
[00:37:54.272 --> 00:38:01.537]  Indian State will offer ivermectin to the entire adult population even as WHO warns against its use as COVID-19 treatment.
[00:38:01.537 --> 00:38:03.619]  No one listens to the WHO.
[00:38:03.619 --> 00:38:10.004]  The head of the WHO vaccine program in 2019 in Switzerland had an emergency meeting, a two-day meeting.
[00:38:10.004 --> 00:38:15.408]  We did reports on it and said vaccines don't work, they're dangerous, they're killing people, and everyone's turning against us.
[00:38:17.639 --> 00:38:23.160]  And their response was to release a bioweapon and then pose as savers to make you take even more deadly stuff.
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:29.801]  They're covering up their previous crimes with an even bigger, giant new crime, which they intend to cover up with even bigger crimes.
[00:38:29.801 --> 00:38:32.362]  I've learned their philosophy.
[00:38:32.362 --> 00:38:44.344]  So I've got all this incredible news and all this breaking information, but the big issue is that these murderers are lying to the public and trying to
[00:38:45.848 --> 00:38:58.637]  Create political correctness around drugs so that people don't get treatment and most hospitals will not give ivermectin in the United States.
[00:38:58.637 --> 00:39:04.181]  And most of the people dying did not get ivermectin and did not get steroids, inhalable steroids.
[00:39:04.181 --> 00:39:10.085]  And I'm gonna tell you again, my mother and my father did not tell me for a week they were at home sick.
[00:39:10.085 --> 00:39:13.107]  I went over there, they looked like they were dead, my dad especially.
[00:39:13.107 --> 00:39:13.868]  Could barely get up.
[00:39:14.884 --> 00:39:28.674]  I got him within five hours on the inhalable steroids, the ivermectin, all of it, and he was running around the next day to some chairs that had gotten delivered that weren't put together, putting chairs together and cooking food.
[00:39:28.674 --> 00:39:30.316]  Just like that.
[00:39:30.316 --> 00:39:32.317]  And if he had gotten it even earlier, it would have been the same thing.
[00:39:32.317 --> 00:39:36.360]  And then I saw it with countless friends and others, because this stuff's run through Austin.
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:39.362]  80% of people have had this stuff.
[00:39:39.362 --> 00:39:40.723]  Okay?
[00:39:40.723 --> 00:39:41.324]  Just like that.
[00:39:42.771 --> 00:39:46.132]  I know, I've experienced it, and I have the scientist.
[00:39:46.132 --> 00:39:57.616]  And how angry should that make us that they're all over the place celebrating people dying from it, saying, oh look, we told you COVID's real.
[00:39:57.616 --> 00:39:59.636]  These people are sick.
[00:39:59.636 --> 00:40:04.098]  So again, here is Rachel Maddow, failed talk show host, her canceling her show.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:07.262]  Lying to her victims.
[00:40:07.262 --> 00:40:17.149]  Drank an injectable ivermectin formulation intended for use in cattle in an attempt to prevent COVID-19 infection.
[00:40:17.149 --> 00:40:26.737]  This patient presented to a hospital with confusion, drowsiness, visual hallucinations, tachypnea, which is rapid breathing, also tremors.
[00:40:26.737 --> 00:40:30.960]  The patient recovered after being hospitalized for nine days.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.262]  Nine days!
[00:40:33.262 --> 00:40:34.543]  Nine days in the hospital.
[00:40:35.968 --> 00:40:44.513]  Drinking injectable ivermectin formulated as an injection that you would shoot into a cow.
[00:40:44.513 --> 00:40:46.794]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:46.794 --> 00:40:50.797]  They think you're stupid and the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[00:40:50.797 --> 00:40:52.538]  All right, the really big news.
[00:40:52.538 --> 00:40:59.642]  I've already gotten to some of it, but I'm going to hit how it ties together with a new article by Jamie White at InfoWars.com.
[00:40:59.642 --> 00:41:02.564]  InfoWars was trending, so was Alex Jones again on Twitter yesterday.
[00:41:03.891 --> 00:41:06.394]  Also on Instagram because people are like, what?
[00:41:06.394 --> 00:41:20.828]  The Rockefeller Foundation and the UN are standardizing the global vaccine passport and now they're saying to buy and sell or to quote Trudeau, to engage in commerce.
[00:41:20.828 --> 00:41:23.872]  You will take shots every five months now.
[00:41:25.523 --> 00:41:29.186]  They've had it all ready, all pre-planned, has nothing to do about protecting you.
[00:41:29.186 --> 00:41:32.108]  It destroys your immune system.
[00:41:32.108 --> 00:41:40.174]  And then when you die of a regular cold or flu because you have no immune system, because it turns your white blood cells off, they will come out and say that it's the unvaccinated that caused it.
[00:41:40.174 --> 00:41:47.479]  The unvaccinated will never admit they've been victimized by the globalists, so they will come after you and your family, who are smart.
[00:41:47.479 --> 00:41:49.540]  Incredible.
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:52.182]  The Australian government came out yesterday and said, get used to it.
[00:41:52.182 --> 00:41:54.364]  Every five months, you will take whatever we put in you.
[00:41:55.475 --> 00:41:58.448]  And start smiling and laughing like a witch.
[00:41:58.448 --> 00:41:59.974]  I mean, these people are crooks.
[00:41:59.974 --> 00:42:00.396]  Psychos.
[00:42:02.435 --> 00:42:05.537]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are selling out of Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:42:05.537 --> 00:42:12.401]  We were only able to get a limited supply of it because supply chain breakdowns has all the vitamins, all the minerals, all the essential amino acids.
[00:42:12.401 --> 00:42:14.402]  It's so good for your immune system, your whole body.
[00:42:14.402 --> 00:42:18.184]  Despite the fact it's going to sell out very soon, we're not getting more in for eight weeks.

[00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.550]  Tastes great.
[00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:31.551]  Fruit punch.

[00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:03.197]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action, and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[00:43:03.197 --> 00:43:12.610]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly, and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[00:43:13.231 --> 00:43:23.194]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[00:43:23.194 --> 00:43:29.955]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening, and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[00:43:29.955 --> 00:43:31.396]  But there is only two things to do.
[00:43:32.516 --> 00:43:35.679]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[00:43:35.679 --> 00:43:38.981]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[00:43:38.981 --> 00:43:44.386]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[00:43:44.386 --> 00:43:46.207]  And so, we must prepare.
[00:43:46.207 --> 00:43:56.255]  Get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:43:57.356 --> 00:44:02.200]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:04.262]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[00:44:04.262 --> 00:44:09.746]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[00:44:09.746 --> 00:44:10.847]  But we failed.
[00:44:10.847 --> 00:44:12.488]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[00:44:12.488 --> 00:44:14.369]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed.
[00:44:14.369 --> 00:44:16.071]  But they are going ahead.
[00:44:16.431 --> 00:44:20.372]  With their full operational deindustrialization, Great Reset.
[00:44:20.372 --> 00:44:29.293]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[00:44:29.293 --> 00:44:34.494]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[00:44:34.494 --> 00:44:37.375]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storable food.
[00:44:37.375 --> 00:44:42.155]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarestore.com.
[00:44:42.155 --> 00:44:45.676]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets,
[00:44:45.976 --> 00:44:47.397]  It's ready to ship right now.
[00:44:47.397 --> 00:44:52.601]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[00:44:52.601 --> 00:44:54.962]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[00:44:54.962 --> 00:44:56.844]  Get ready at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:44:58.550 --> 00:44:59.911]  It's always critical.
[00:44:59.911 --> 00:45:00.891]  It's always vital.
[00:45:00.891 --> 00:45:04.834]  It's always essential to have enough high quality vitamins and minerals in your body.
[00:45:04.834 --> 00:45:07.755]  That's why essential vitamins and minerals are called essential.
[00:45:07.755 --> 00:45:08.876]  You must have them.
[00:45:08.876 --> 00:45:14.859]  But in today's crazy times, it is more important than ever to stay on top of it.
[00:45:14.859 --> 00:45:17.781]  And the Vitamin Mineral Fusion has been sold out for months and months and months.
[00:45:17.781 --> 00:45:20.643]  It's got all the essential vitamins and minerals and amino acids.
[00:45:20.643 --> 00:45:21.003]  It is
[00:45:21.383 --> 00:45:23.985]  33% off while supplies last.
[00:45:23.985 --> 00:45:25.246]  X2's been sold out for a while.
[00:45:25.246 --> 00:45:26.567]  It's now back in stock.
[00:45:26.567 --> 00:45:28.328]  It's discounted while supplies last.
[00:45:28.328 --> 00:45:30.150]  We have this great concentrated turmeric formula.
[00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:31.050]  It's amazing.
[00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:32.111]  It's back in stock.
[00:45:32.111 --> 00:45:33.132]  They're all discounted.
[00:45:33.132 --> 00:45:35.033]  33% to 50% off while supplies last.
[00:45:37.475 --> 00:45:37.876]  Thank you.
[00:45:59.585 --> 00:46:06.373]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on.
[00:46:06.373 --> 00:46:09.938]  And that is criminals are extremely pathological.
[00:46:09.938 --> 00:46:11.079]  Even more the general public.
[00:46:11.079 --> 00:46:13.462]  They do the same things over and over again.
[00:46:13.462 --> 00:46:17.908]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[00:46:19.039 --> 00:46:19.879]  Well guess what?
[00:46:19.879 --> 00:46:33.886]  It was Anthony Fauci and eugenicists globalists that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research.
[00:46:35.086 --> 00:46:40.569]  of viruses that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[00:46:40.569 --> 00:46:46.933]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road.
[00:46:46.933 --> 00:46:56.238]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[00:46:56.238 --> 00:46:57.359]  That's right ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:02.153 --> 00:47:11.895]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:11.895 --> 00:47:13.796]  And we are again back live.
[00:47:13.796 --> 00:47:16.577]  Thank you so much for joining us on this show.
[00:47:27.998 --> 00:47:30.980]  Tuesday, August 31st, Worldwide Transmission.
[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:52.672]  We have a very special guest joining us, coming up in the third hour today, Dr. Judy A. Mikovits, who worked directly with Fauci in the NIH and the CDC and saw his criminal activity and blew the whistle on him.
[00:47:53.729 --> 00:48:00.254]  And of course she was in the film, Plandemic, that came out last year, that they demonized an attack that went viral.
[00:48:00.254 --> 00:48:13.664]  And just like they attack Ivermectin, and go, oh that's for horses, that's stupid, that's crazy, when it was invented for humans, and the Japanese go, oh no, this is absolutely antiviral, and it's been proven to be so.
[00:48:13.664 --> 00:48:17.427]  They go, oh sure, she worked with him, but she's a kook, she got arrested.
[00:48:17.427 --> 00:48:18.568]  Yeah, they came and arrested her.
[00:48:19.721 --> 00:48:23.082]  To cover up what Fauci was doing, just like they're trying to arrest me.
[00:48:23.082 --> 00:48:29.064]  But I don't need to believe Dr. Mikovits, who's a great lady.
[00:48:29.064 --> 00:48:31.384]  I already know about Fauci going back to the 80s.
[00:48:31.384 --> 00:48:34.305]  Her issues were in the 90s with him.
[00:48:34.305 --> 00:48:44.948]  I mean, this guy has been involved in eugenics and the HIV rollout and blocking good treatments and giving people poison treatments forever.
[00:48:44.948 --> 00:48:48.009]  So, that is coming up.
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:56.084]  Ladies and gentlemen, in the third hour, we're going to open the phones up in the second hour and go over a ton of news as well.
[00:48:56.084 --> 00:49:04.788]  And let me just stop for a moment because if we don't do this, it actually helps the globalists.
[00:49:04.788 --> 00:49:07.970]  If we just normalize all this evil and kind of just glaze over this,
[00:49:09.721 --> 00:49:13.463]  Then we just become acclimated to accept it, including myself.
[00:49:13.463 --> 00:49:21.426]  We have to let this really burn in and really hit us at the core so we can reach out to others and try to wake them up.
[00:49:21.426 --> 00:49:37.134]  Because so much of what the globalists bank on is that by the time the average person is 20 years old, who's been born the last 60 years, they have seen hundreds of thousands of murders, hundreds of thousands of rapes,
[00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:41.182]  They've seen spaceships blow up DC.
[00:49:41.182 --> 00:49:42.342]  They've seen torture.
[00:49:42.342 --> 00:49:43.383]  They've seen saw.
[00:49:43.383 --> 00:49:45.964]  They've seen Friday the 13th.
[00:49:45.964 --> 00:49:48.565]  And I'm not calling for censorship of all that.
[00:49:48.565 --> 00:49:58.990]  But when you play shoot-em-up video games and when you watch all these violent movies, it desensitizes you to the real thing.
[00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:06.974]  My dad's dad was in World War II and saw a lot of combat in the air and then after he did his missions on the ground in Italy.
[00:50:06.974 --> 00:50:07.755]  And he was a tough guy.
[00:50:09.597 --> 00:50:14.358]  And if there was a bunch of violence in a movie, he'd get up and leave.
[00:50:14.358 --> 00:50:20.760]  Just because it wasn't a joke to him, and he'd grown up not seeing violence in movies, he'd seen it in the real world.
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:29.623]  He'd seen blood and people's guts blown out and their, you know, heads blown off and starving dead children and bombed out craters with dead families in them.
[00:50:29.623 --> 00:50:32.204]  So, and bodies covered with maggots and all the rest of it.
[00:50:32.204 --> 00:50:34.385]  So, he didn't think it was cute.
[00:50:34.385 --> 00:50:35.565]  He wasn't desensitized.
[00:50:39.326 --> 00:50:54.636]  You read something like Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five, which is a story about him, in World War II, shot down in an old slaughterhouse they were using for American POWs, and what it was like to have our own planes dropping bombs on him.
[00:50:54.636 --> 00:50:58.279]  People read that today, they're not that shocked, because they've read so much, they've seen so much.
[00:50:58.279 --> 00:51:04.763]  They don't actually experience, like people reading that back in the 60s did, about what it was like to be bombed by your own planes.
[00:51:10.049 --> 00:51:10.970]  So it's the same thing.
[00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:16.073]  People don't differentiate fiction from non-fiction.
[00:51:16.073 --> 00:51:19.474]  This bio-attack, this globalist attack is not fiction.
[00:51:19.474 --> 00:51:31.441]  This World ID and this system designed to turn the economy off, with new climate lockdowns now being announced in Europe and Canada and coming here, this isn't a joke.
[00:51:31.441 --> 00:51:32.542]  This is real.
[00:51:32.542 --> 00:51:34.003]  And look, I know the audience knows.
[00:51:34.003 --> 00:51:36.684]  We're like, yeah, we know that this is real versus fiction.
[00:51:36.684 --> 00:51:37.345]  Yeah, but still.
[00:51:38.809 --> 00:51:51.191]  At a subconscious level, you've already seen alien suckers on people's faces and aliens busting out of people's chests and eating their intestines.
[00:51:51.191 --> 00:52:00.293]  You've already seen all this stuff in movies and all the zombie movies of millions being mowed down dead and the Pentagon does drills of mowing down zombies.
[00:52:00.293 --> 00:52:03.093]  That means mowing down crowds of starving people.
[00:52:03.093 --> 00:52:04.254]  The globals are getting ready for that.
[00:52:04.254 --> 00:52:06.454]  They're engineering the controlled collapse.
[00:52:08.114 --> 00:52:11.296]  They're going to build their armored fortresses, their safe reservations.
[00:52:11.296 --> 00:52:14.177]  The rest of us are going to be left on the outside to kill each other.
[00:52:14.177 --> 00:52:22.001]  And so it's a self-fulfilling prophecy to see yourself as garbage, to see yourselves as zombies.
[00:52:22.001 --> 00:52:27.683]  And now Microsoft put out a video game called Stay Homer, where the Chinese military works with the U.S.
[00:52:27.683 --> 00:52:29.304]  military.
[00:52:29.304 --> 00:52:35.067]  Here it is on screen, going around launching RPGs into crowds of teenagers and killing them.
[00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:42.432]  Because they all deserve to die.
[00:52:42.432 --> 00:52:53.377]  So when I get up here and I read this stuff to you on air, this is real.
[00:52:53.377 --> 00:52:57.419]  So let me tell you what's coming up next hour, interspersed with your calls here.
[00:52:58.527 --> 00:53:01.029]  Global bombshells, it all ties together.
[00:53:01.029 --> 00:53:13.479]  WHO releases plan for global digital vaccine passport funded by Bill Gates and Rockefeller Foundation, InfoWars.com.
[00:53:13.479 --> 00:53:21.686]  And people are freaking out about this right now because it says developed by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:53:21.686 --> 00:53:25.329]  You can see the screenshot of it all, the excellent article by Jamie White.
[00:53:26.624 --> 00:53:27.904]  Let me show you the actual documents.
[00:53:27.904 --> 00:53:29.145]  They're on Twitter.
[00:53:29.145 --> 00:53:37.026]  WHO has published a guidance document for countries implementing partners on the introduction of digital vaccine certificates.
[00:53:37.026 --> 00:53:43.848]  Run by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, amongst others, and the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:53:43.848 --> 00:53:45.648]  And here are the documents.
[00:53:45.648 --> 00:53:54.930]  You can see it right here, where it says, digital documentation COVID-19 certificate, the global standard run by the United Nations.
[00:53:56.991 --> 00:54:14.607]  Digital documentation, COVID-19 certificates, vaccine status, and it says right here, the work was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Government of Estonia, Foundation, Bontar, State of Kuwait, and the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:54:16.837 --> 00:54:24.424]  So that's who runs all this, and we've got the entire document right here, and I don't need to read the document, though I did scan over it this morning.
[00:54:24.424 --> 00:54:28.007]  It's already seen their plan, studying it for years, it's all right here.
[00:54:28.007 --> 00:54:30.309]  But here's the plan.
[00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:44.220]  Digital documentation of COVID-19 certificates, vaccination status, the total control of all society, the world ID, including an implantable microchip, and even how they use blockchain to track you by satellite and by smart chip
[00:54:45.049 --> 00:54:53.734]  To then pay you according to how you behave and how this will then implement the carbon tax and the carbon tracking control system.
[00:54:53.734 --> 00:54:56.696]  Now Schwab already wrote books on it five years ago.
[00:54:56.696 --> 00:55:00.278]  We already know the plan, but here it is in implementation.
[00:55:00.278 --> 00:55:02.379]  Don't have to wait anymore, it's in your face.
[00:55:02.379 --> 00:55:03.780]  Okay?
[00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:05.821]  And look at this, Forbes.
[00:55:05.821 --> 00:55:10.064]  World needs equivalent of pandemic lockdown every two years to meet Paris climate goals.
[00:55:12.298 --> 00:55:16.841]  Merlin University canteens cuts meat from the menus to curb climate change.
[00:55:16.841 --> 00:55:18.202]  BBC.
[00:55:18.202 --> 00:55:22.565]  Extension Rebellion protests block London Tower Bridge.
[00:55:22.565 --> 00:55:25.447]  That's what all these lockdowns are, folks.
[00:55:25.447 --> 00:55:31.732]  And now Trudeau, I'll play it next hour, has come out and he's the tip of the spear for these guys.
[00:55:31.732 --> 00:55:38.697]  And he said, you're not going to engage in commerce unless you have a vaccine passport, and we're going to use this to implement
[00:55:39.588 --> 00:55:45.592]  How we're going to save the environment, and the housing crisis, and universal income.
[00:55:45.592 --> 00:55:47.493]  But with it comes control, and he says that.
[00:55:47.493 --> 00:55:49.795]  I mean, folks, this is slavery.
[00:55:49.795 --> 00:55:54.138]  Like being a goldfish in a fish tank.
[00:55:54.138 --> 00:55:58.041]  Yeah, the fish is in there, but it lives according to you.
[00:55:58.041 --> 00:55:58.981]  It's under your control.
[00:55:58.981 --> 00:56:01.163]  If you're a nice person, the fish is fine.
[00:56:01.163 --> 00:56:02.764]  If you're not, the fish dies.
[00:56:02.764 --> 00:56:04.025]  Well, they want to kill us.
[00:56:06.616 --> 00:56:10.538]  So everybody's starting to freak out going, wow, it's Alex Jones' world.
[00:56:10.538 --> 00:56:13.379]  No, it's the globalist world.
[00:56:13.379 --> 00:56:15.020]  People are like, how did this guy know it?
[00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:15.980]  How is it all coming true?
[00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:18.662]  Because they freaking planned it all.
[00:56:18.662 --> 00:56:21.363]  Do you understand we know the next steps?
[00:56:21.363 --> 00:56:27.786]  Cutting off the resources, exploding crime, getting rid of the police except for themselves.
[00:56:27.786 --> 00:56:29.927]  A dystopia.
[00:56:29.927 --> 00:56:32.668]  They want to get rid of at least 80% of the world population by 2030.
[00:56:34.042 --> 00:56:35.563]  That's in the next nine years.
[00:56:35.563 --> 00:56:39.926]  Do you have any idea the hell we're about to enter?
[00:56:39.926 --> 00:56:42.188]  This is destabilization by design.
[00:56:42.188 --> 00:56:43.709]  Starvation by design.
[00:56:43.709 --> 00:56:45.210]  Collapsed borders by design.
[00:56:45.210 --> 00:56:46.351]  Race war by design.
[00:56:46.351 --> 00:56:51.214]  And that's another reason you need to get out of the big cities.
[00:56:51.214 --> 00:56:52.575]  You better get with people you can trust.
[00:56:52.575 --> 00:56:53.836]  You better get self-sufficient.
[00:56:53.836 --> 00:56:55.177]  And I'm talking to myself right now.
[00:56:55.177 --> 00:56:56.338]  I need to do it as well.
[00:56:56.338 --> 00:56:57.418]  I'm selling my house.
[00:56:57.418 --> 00:56:59.280]  All of it.
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:00.861]  Moving into a trailer outside Austin.
[00:57:02.110 --> 00:57:07.333]  The well, the solar panels, the shotgun, the rifle, the four-wheel drive.
[00:57:07.333 --> 00:57:08.513]  Country Boy can survive.
[00:57:08.513 --> 00:57:10.254]  And I've got storable food.
[00:57:10.254 --> 00:57:10.954]  Ready to ship.
[00:57:10.954 --> 00:57:11.995]  And I've got it myself.
[00:57:11.995 --> 00:57:13.756]  And I've got to have extra for family.
[00:57:13.756 --> 00:57:15.236]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:57:15.236 --> 00:57:16.257]  I would get storable food.
[00:57:16.257 --> 00:57:17.398]  It funds us.
[00:57:17.398 --> 00:57:18.398]  It's something you need.
[00:57:18.398 --> 00:57:18.978]  It's high quality.
[00:57:18.978 --> 00:57:19.819]  It's ready to ship to you.
[00:57:21.047 --> 00:57:29.329]  One month, six month, year's supply, specialty foods, infowarestore.com, the entire MyPatriot catalog, lowest prices, and then that funds our operation.
[00:57:29.329 --> 00:57:34.351]  I would get Swirlable Foods at infowarestore.com right now and get that off your checklist.
[00:57:34.351 --> 00:57:41.573]  But again, that's their plan is to starve you, to take your security away, so also be sure and get yourselves armed and trained.
[00:57:41.573 --> 00:57:45.094]  We'll be right back with a ton of breaking news, your phone calls and special guests.

[00:58:48.604 --> 00:58:53.468]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[00:58:53.468 --> 00:58:55.509]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[00:58:55.509 --> 00:59:00.994]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[00:59:00.994 --> 00:59:02.095]  But we failed.
[00:59:02.095 --> 00:59:03.756]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[00:59:03.756 --> 00:59:05.617]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed.
[00:59:05.617 --> 00:59:10.561]  But they are going ahead with their full operational de-industrialization Great Reset.
[00:59:11.542 --> 00:59:20.466]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[00:59:20.466 --> 00:59:25.648]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[00:59:25.648 --> 00:59:28.570]  And one of the number one things to do is high-quality, storable food.
[00:59:28.570 --> 00:59:33.332]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarestore.com.
[00:59:33.332 --> 00:59:38.494]  So whether it's a month or a six-month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[00:59:38.894 --> 00:59:43.799]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[00:59:43.799 --> 00:59:46.142]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[00:59:46.142 --> 00:59:51.427]  Get ready at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:59:51.427 --> 00:59:54.050]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:15.487 --> 01:00:17.808]  All right, we're now into hour number two.
[01:00:17.808 --> 01:00:30.175]  We have a huge whistleblower that funded major operations, worked very, very high levels, and blew the whistle on Fauci.
[01:00:30.175 --> 01:00:34.538]  Joining us coming up in the next hour, Dr. Judy A. Mickiewicz.
[01:00:35.973 --> 01:00:40.494]  She, of course, is the main person in Plandemic, a film that really exposed these guys.
[01:00:40.494 --> 01:00:46.736]  I really look forward to having Dr. Judy A. Mikovits on the transmission.
[01:00:46.736 --> 01:00:51.477]  I'm going to give the number out next segment and go back to your calls.
[01:00:51.477 --> 01:00:55.098]  First-time callers on your reports of what the vaccines have done to you and your family.
[01:00:55.098 --> 01:00:58.178]  If you love it, you hate it, or you're neutral on it.
[01:00:58.178 --> 01:01:00.439]  What experiences are you seeing in hospitals you work at?
[01:01:01.425 --> 01:01:08.048]  We'll give that number out coming up next segment when some stations join us.
[01:01:08.048 --> 01:01:17.593]  In the meantime, there's not many people more creepy than Brian Stelter.
[01:01:17.593 --> 01:01:19.314]  And one of them is Michael Moore.
[01:01:19.314 --> 01:01:22.476]  At the start of the next segment, I'm going to get some into him.
[01:01:22.476 --> 01:01:30.280]  Because he says that after Afghanistan evacuation, time to defend America against their own domestic Taliban.
[01:01:32.039 --> 01:01:36.821]  And you dovetail this with these different soldiers online saying, we're preparing for martial law.
[01:01:36.821 --> 01:01:40.203]  Stay in your houses when we say, or we're going to kill you.
[01:01:40.203 --> 01:01:48.727]  That all ties in to the globalist model of using NATO and the US military to suppress domestic populations.
[01:01:48.727 --> 01:01:53.589]  And they want to do this to get the good people out of the military.
[01:01:53.589 --> 01:01:56.230]  So, I mean, these people know what they're doing.
[01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:59.532]  They know what they're part of.
[01:01:59.532 --> 01:02:01.313]  We're going to tie all that together
[01:02:03.626 --> 01:02:08.548]  With the announcements being made around the world about how they're going to have new carbon lockdowns.
[01:02:08.548 --> 01:02:15.431]  And I've got the Prime Minister of Canada on that and more we're going to be playing.
[01:02:15.431 --> 01:02:30.238]  But just like I said, let's let this sink in earlier about how they have studies in Japan, studies in England, studies in Germany, studies in all over Africa, studies all over
[01:02:31.803 --> 01:02:46.803]  South America, and all they know is people that take ivermectin twice a year prophylactically don't get all these weird jungle fevers, don't get all sorts of things, not just worms.
[01:02:50.934 --> 01:02:58.676]  Again, the fact that they sit up there on the news and go, it's just crazy that people are buying this up and that doctors are prescribing this.
[01:02:58.676 --> 01:03:08.979]  And so when I go and I got medical doctors to prescribe this stuff to more than 50 people I know that have gotten sick the last few months, they go, okay, well, where's the mom and pop pharmacy?
[01:03:08.979 --> 01:03:12.220]  Because the big pharmacies won't even do it.
[01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:16.501]  You know, they've got ivermectin for humans.
[01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:17.862]  And again, that's murder.
[01:03:17.862 --> 01:03:18.822]  That's bureaucratic.
[01:03:20.555 --> 01:03:22.296]  Murder?
[01:03:22.296 --> 01:03:26.277]  And the Japanese are just as good as the West at medicine or anything else.
[01:03:26.277 --> 01:03:27.898]  They're just as smart.
[01:03:27.898 --> 01:03:32.000]  They're just as high IQ as any other group, okay?
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.141]  They're amongst the smartest people in the world.
[01:03:34.141 --> 01:03:35.701]  No one's debating that.
[01:03:35.701 --> 01:03:46.726]  And the media, notice, won't touch the Japanese government and Japanese groups and heads of Japanese medical unions saying, 100% success rate if taken early.
[01:03:47.725 --> 01:03:50.926]  Seventy-something percent if it's in the latter stages.
[01:03:50.926 --> 01:03:51.666]  I've seen it.
[01:03:51.666 --> 01:03:55.607]  So, I've got hundreds of clips to play, hundreds of articles, incredible stuff to cover.
[01:03:55.607 --> 01:04:12.270]  I'm just going to go ivermectin, ivermectin because it physically causes me to have, you know, that burning fire feeling in your chest, where my body is commanding me to go out and get aggressive with people, killing folks that come to these hospitals that won't give it to them.
[01:04:12.270 --> 01:04:14.971]  Now, a lot of hospitals are, and they're good, and they're bucking the system.
[01:04:14.971 --> 01:04:15.751]  Say, about half of them.
[01:04:17.065 --> 01:04:24.193]  Hospitals that aren't, folks, need to be protested and demonstrated against and hit with the truth.
[01:04:24.193 --> 01:04:31.362]  Because they're ignoring the science, they're ignoring the history, they're ignoring the realities of all of this.
[01:04:31.362 --> 01:04:31.882]  And it's criminal.
[01:04:32.737 --> 01:04:33.898]  It really is criminal.
[01:04:33.898 --> 01:04:42.142]  They have all these newscasts making fun of people, show that other hospitals and doctors won't subscribe it, when they know good and damn well it works.
[01:04:42.142 --> 01:04:45.584]  And I experienced it with countless people I know.
[01:04:45.584 --> 01:04:49.647]  I mean, it's like 50 people that I've held their hand and gotten their prescription.
[01:04:49.647 --> 01:04:54.629]  That's why I blew up on that caller call, because they got so mad thinking about the damn hospital knows good and damn well it works.
[01:04:54.629 --> 01:04:55.950]  I won't give it to you because it's cheap.
[01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:57.171]  They want to make money and kill your ass.
[01:04:58.314 --> 01:05:01.736]  In these insane times, I wouldn't mess around.
[01:05:01.736 --> 01:05:04.858]  I wouldn't screw around with your health and your immune system.
[01:05:04.858 --> 01:05:15.265]  I would do everything you can to boost your body's natural defenses and, at the same time, support those that are fighting the globalists and fighting to stop new lockdowns and tyranny.

[01:06:03.758 --> 01:06:07.762]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:07.762 --> 01:06:16.650]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:16.650 --> 01:06:20.653]  Well, I'm very honored to be here with you on this August 31st, 2021 transmission.
[01:06:20.653 --> 01:06:22.455]  Thank you all for your prayers.
[01:06:22.455 --> 01:06:23.436]  Thank you for your support.
[01:06:23.436 --> 01:06:24.837]  We're all in this together.
[01:06:24.837 --> 01:06:26.619]  I want to tie three
[01:06:28.596 --> 01:06:32.540]  Big stories together and then tie that to what's happening in Afghanistan.
[01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:34.822]  Then I'm gonna go to your phone calls.
[01:06:34.822 --> 01:06:40.207]  We're gonna open the number up right now and the phone system up for first-time callers to give us your take.
[01:06:41.067 --> 01:06:41.307]  All right.
[01:06:59.961 --> 01:07:05.164]  And it's like 100% in like, again, five, six hours, just you're better.
[01:07:05.164 --> 01:07:07.425]  Just like Trump said last year, he was telling the truth.
[01:07:07.425 --> 01:07:12.007]  And I see the left attacking me again without even looking on Instagram and Twitter and Facebook.
[01:07:12.007 --> 01:07:14.768]  People send it to me going, look at this scum.
[01:07:14.768 --> 01:07:16.709]  The FBI needs to arrest Jones.
[01:07:16.709 --> 01:07:18.310]  He's not a doctor.
[01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:21.151]  He shouldn't talk about Regeneron.
[01:07:21.151 --> 01:07:25.093]  I mean, he shouldn't talk about vitamin D or ivermectin.
[01:07:25.093 --> 01:07:26.434]  He needs to be locked up.
[01:07:27.549 --> 01:07:33.192]  As citizens, we're allowed to talk about our personal experiences with a doctor or a drug.
[01:07:33.192 --> 01:07:37.074]  You know, even Bill Maher said, I don't want Google censoring ivermectin.
[01:07:37.074 --> 01:07:39.616]  It's not a Republican, it's a drug.
[01:07:39.616 --> 01:07:40.316]  What a tell!
[01:07:40.316 --> 01:07:43.238]  He wants them censoring Republicans, I guess.
[01:07:43.238 --> 01:07:44.298]  But not drugs.
[01:07:44.298 --> 01:07:46.019]  He wants to know.
[01:07:46.019 --> 01:07:50.581]  But they censored all the hundreds of studies over the last 50 years about it.
[01:07:50.581 --> 01:07:53.343]  And if you understand that, you understand everything.
[01:07:53.343 --> 01:07:56.525]  And in fairness to Bill Maher, he says I shouldn't be censored and that they
[01:07:57.577 --> 01:08:07.206]  Or wrong, but he's trying to get his audience to come along for free speech and go, hey, it's not a Republican, it's a drug!
[01:08:07.206 --> 01:08:13.412]  So this is tyranny, and we need to get past this being a partisan issue.
[01:08:13.412 --> 01:08:15.394]  This is attacking everybody.
[01:08:15.394 --> 01:08:19.057]  And that's why I'm more than happy to attack Trump when he supports these poison shots.
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.381]  I wanted Trump to fight the globalists.
[01:08:21.381 --> 01:08:22.561]  I wanted Trump to secure the borders.
[01:08:22.561 --> 01:08:24.723]  I wanted Trump to protect our guns.
[01:08:24.723 --> 01:08:26.303]  I wanted Trump to stay out of China.
[01:08:26.303 --> 01:08:27.104]  He did all that.
[01:08:27.104 --> 01:08:29.625]  That's great.
[01:08:29.625 --> 01:08:31.947]  But he's our employee.
[01:08:31.947 --> 01:08:47.055]  And it's like if you've got an employee that 300 days out of the year does a great job, but let's just say that last 65 days, you catch him taking a dump in your office, it's not a good thing.
[01:08:48.783 --> 01:08:51.846]  And taking a dump in your office is a lot nicer than pushing a poison shot.
[01:08:51.846 --> 01:08:54.589]  I don't want to use a gross analogy here.
[01:08:54.589 --> 01:09:06.423]  I'm just simply saying that Trump is dead wrong when he got up there on that podium in Alabama and he got booed rightfully and he said
[01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:08.670]  It works.
[01:09:08.670 --> 01:09:09.331]  It works great.
[01:09:09.331 --> 01:09:11.172]  If it doesn't work, I'll tell you.
[01:09:11.172 --> 01:09:14.294]  It's down to 39% efficacy and it lowers your immune system.
[01:09:14.294 --> 01:09:15.395]  That's admitted now.
[01:09:15.395 --> 01:09:17.796]  Now they want booster shots every five to six months.
[01:09:17.796 --> 01:09:19.437]  It's bull!
[01:09:19.437 --> 01:09:23.420]  And Trump on Fox & Friends said that days before.
[01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:25.101]  He said, oh, this is a scam.
[01:09:25.101 --> 01:09:27.062]  They're going to make $10 billion off the boosters.
[01:09:27.062 --> 01:09:28.563]  Uh, yeah.
[01:09:28.563 --> 01:09:29.944]  Yeah.
[01:09:29.944 --> 01:09:31.325]  So you're not stupid.
[01:09:31.325 --> 01:09:32.286]  I said, you're smart.
[01:09:32.286 --> 01:09:33.306]  You know what you're doing.
[01:09:33.306 --> 01:09:34.407]  Or maybe you're stupid.
[01:09:34.407 --> 01:09:35.628]  It'd be better if you were stupid.
[01:09:37.466 --> 01:09:43.690]  And of course the media ran with that and, you know, oh Alex Jones turns on Trump, betrays Trump.
[01:09:43.690 --> 01:09:46.852]  I didn't betray anything.
[01:09:46.852 --> 01:09:54.717]  I know Trump got stampeded in supporting these vaccines because he trusted the doctors and thought they were going to hold the economy hostage until he got this approved.
[01:09:54.717 --> 01:09:55.998]  And then he thought he'd be a hero.
[01:09:55.998 --> 01:09:57.499]  But these aren't good medical systems.
[01:09:57.499 --> 01:09:59.000]  This is a corrupt globalist move.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.842]  This is not a regular vaccine, Trump.
[01:10:01.842 --> 01:10:03.843]  It might have side effects but actually works.
[01:10:03.843 --> 01:10:04.864]  It's poison!
[01:10:04.864 --> 01:10:06.785]  You got conned, you got lied to.
[01:10:10.117 --> 01:10:16.921]  And I've talked to people that have talked at length with Trump and got him to say, at least you have your own freedom, you shouldn't be made to take it.
[01:10:16.921 --> 01:10:19.383]  That took doing with Trump.
[01:10:19.383 --> 01:10:25.706]  Now, he does respond to his base, and now I think you're going to start hearing more criticism of these injections.
[01:10:25.706 --> 01:10:26.107]  Good!
[01:10:26.107 --> 01:10:32.631]  Because I'm not trying to win popularity contests, or not trying to have Trump call me up and tell me how great I am.
[01:10:32.631 --> 01:10:34.572]  He's already done that plenty of times.
[01:10:34.572 --> 01:10:35.953]  I don't give a damn about that.
[01:10:36.698 --> 01:10:39.560]  It's not about how powerful I am or who I know or any of this crap.
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:41.041]  I live in Texas.
[01:10:41.041 --> 01:10:42.622]  I don't want to live in D.C.
[01:10:42.622 --> 01:10:44.263]  or Mar-a-Lago or L.A.
[01:10:44.263 --> 01:10:45.664]  around the power structure.
[01:10:45.664 --> 01:10:47.806]  I've been in Texas my whole life.
[01:10:47.806 --> 01:10:50.568]  My family founded Texas on both sides.
[01:10:50.568 --> 01:10:51.849]  People ask why I'm in Austin?
[01:10:51.849 --> 01:10:56.212]  Because my family's been here since the 1820s when it was Waterloo.
[01:10:58.669 --> 01:11:00.170]  And yes, it's now L.A.
[01:11:00.170 --> 01:11:00.951]  and it's horrible!
[01:11:00.951 --> 01:11:02.112]  And I'm probably gonna move.
[01:11:02.112 --> 01:11:04.394]  I don't have the money to move the infrastructure.
[01:11:04.394 --> 01:11:06.496]  I'll move it to some right-wing city in Austin.
[01:11:06.496 --> 01:11:09.798]  But there's no right-wing cities in Texas.
[01:11:09.798 --> 01:11:11.360]  Alright, I'm ranting and I said I'd cover the news.
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:12.400]  Let me give you the number.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:12.681]  It's 877-789-2539.
[01:11:12.681 --> 01:11:12.881]  877-789-Alex.
[01:11:12.881 --> 01:11:12.941]  877-789-2539.
[01:11:12.941 --> 01:11:13.041]  Okay.
[01:11:26.357 --> 01:11:27.657]  Let me tie all these things together.
[01:11:27.657 --> 01:11:35.479]  You got Michael Moore saying, after Afghanistan evacuation, time to defend America against our own domestic Taliban.
[01:11:35.479 --> 01:11:46.882]  He goes on to say, those that attack the Capitol and those Republicans that question the election, they are against our domestic laws and they are our domestic Taliban.
[01:11:46.882 --> 01:11:54.104]  We must strengthen ourselves against them and they're the terror threat and we must use the military against them, the domestic Taliban.
[01:11:55.094 --> 01:11:56.675]  The quotes are all there.
[01:11:56.675 --> 01:12:00.036]  You can go read it if you want.
[01:12:00.036 --> 01:12:05.538]  And then he attacks Southern Baptists and says they're like the Taliban and Christians are bad.
[01:12:05.538 --> 01:12:08.138]  I mean, look at the photo of this guy for your TV viewer.
[01:12:08.138 --> 01:12:09.459]  Just, just look.
[01:12:09.459 --> 01:12:11.740]  I'm not saying he's a pedophile.
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:20.623]  I'm saying if I was going to cast two guys that drive around in a white van in a movie and kidnap children and then take them to an underground dungeon and drink their blood, that is, I mean, look at that demon.
[01:12:20.623 --> 01:12:21.123]  Zoom in on him.
[01:12:24.588 --> 01:12:27.470]  He sure as hell wants to molest our rights and start a civil war.
[01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:27.910]  I know that.
[01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:29.951]  Not saying he's a child molester.
[01:12:29.951 --> 01:12:34.454]  He's saying if I was going to cast somebody in a movie to play one, he'd be it.
[01:12:34.454 --> 01:12:38.197]  Now, let's continue.
[01:12:38.197 --> 01:12:41.159]  I mean, would I place a bet?
[01:12:41.159 --> 01:12:43.540]  Yeah, you know I'd place a bet as well.
[01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:45.281]  Bet my right arm.
[01:12:45.281 --> 01:12:49.344]  The point is, is that they're spoiling for a war with us
[01:12:50.744 --> 01:12:51.745]  Get the clip ready, please.
[01:12:51.745 --> 01:12:58.651]  Just like the woman who now defends herself and is a big leftist saying, hey, you don't do what we say.
[01:12:58.651 --> 01:13:00.333]  You don't stay in your house during a lockdown.
[01:13:00.333 --> 01:13:01.914]  I'm gonna kill your ass.
[01:13:01.914 --> 01:13:03.335]  It's called martial law.
[01:13:03.335 --> 01:13:07.159]  They sign up because their whole rite of passage is hating America.
[01:13:07.159 --> 01:13:10.362]  Their whole rite of passage is no borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[01:13:10.362 --> 01:13:16.167]  You cannot imagine how much these people hate this country and how much they want to dominate you and your family.
[01:13:16.167 --> 01:13:17.348]  Go ahead and roll the audio of this lady.
[01:13:18.437 --> 01:13:19.639]  And then she goes on to say more.
[01:13:36.277 --> 01:13:37.397]  So that's who these folks are.
[01:13:37.397 --> 01:13:48.762]  And to live under martial law, they need the digital documentation of COVID-19 certificate vaccination status put out by the UN, written by the Rockefeller and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[01:13:48.762 --> 01:13:52.643]  Go read it for yourself.
[01:13:52.643 --> 01:13:54.864]  And that ties into all of this.
[01:13:54.864 --> 01:13:56.985]  And so how do they respond?
[01:13:56.985 --> 01:14:00.186]  Twitter is removing people that post the Reuter article.
[01:14:01.681 --> 01:14:10.569]  Where Reuters admits contaminated and Moderna vaccines suspected to be metallic particles, says the Japanese government, they've recalled them all.
[01:14:10.569 --> 01:14:13.091]  First a million six, then 2.5 million.
[01:14:13.091 --> 01:14:19.257]  Now they've recalled all the Moderna because it's all got nano-medical metal particles in it.
[01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:22.291]  What did everybody say it had in it?
[01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:23.131]  What did we predict?
[01:14:23.131 --> 01:14:28.915]  We said metal nanoparticles to track your body and permanently mark you.
[01:14:28.915 --> 01:14:29.315]  Why not?
[01:14:29.315 --> 01:14:30.496]  They're already killing you too.
[01:14:30.496 --> 01:14:34.098]  They're already giving you a soft kill weapon.
[01:14:34.098 --> 01:14:35.559]  That's Reuters.
[01:14:35.559 --> 01:14:39.401]  Moderna vaccine production continues in EU amid contamination.
[01:14:39.401 --> 01:14:40.502]  Probe Reuters.
[01:14:43.114 --> 01:14:50.036]  People got suspended from Twitter a few months ago for saying that there was nanometal in them.
[01:14:50.036 --> 01:14:50.476]  Remember?
[01:14:50.476 --> 01:15:01.458]  Separate labs in Germany scanned it and said, look, it's liquid nanometal that moves on its own through the body and is magnetic.
[01:15:01.458 --> 01:15:03.579]  Remember all the electron microscope stuff?
[01:15:03.579 --> 01:15:06.359]  And then people wouldn't take it because it wasn't approved.
[01:15:06.359 --> 01:15:08.300]  So the FDA said, oh, we're approving it.
[01:15:09.813 --> 01:15:10.654]  It's all semantical.
[01:15:10.654 --> 01:15:19.119]  They go, now authorizing a experimental shot and reauthorizing it as experimental is called authorizing and saying it's approved.
[01:15:19.119 --> 01:15:20.320]  They just made it up.
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:22.562]  No approval, no test, no nothing.
[01:15:22.562 --> 01:15:26.845]  They say in 2025 they might release something.
[01:15:26.845 --> 01:15:31.688]  Black nanoparticles that are magnetic in it that are killing people!
[01:15:33.666 --> 01:15:38.689]  Meanwhile, I've got all this video of them running people over with cars in Australia.
[01:15:38.689 --> 01:15:41.591]  Police dogs ripping people's faces off in the UK.
[01:15:41.591 --> 01:15:46.734]  Horses running over women and blasting their faces off with water cannons.
[01:15:46.734 --> 01:15:48.575]  Blood everywhere in Germany.
[01:15:48.575 --> 01:15:51.837]  And the left is celebrating it and loves it.
[01:15:51.837 --> 01:15:53.919]  They just absolutely love it.
[01:15:53.919 --> 01:15:55.900]  Your calls and more coming up.
[01:16:00.066 --> 01:16:02.127]  Your voice counts.

[01:16:07.190 --> 01:16:09.792]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[01:16:09.792 --> 01:16:11.273]  They know you're angry.
[01:16:11.273 --> 01:16:16.096]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[01:18:45.623 --> 01:18:58.331]  In late August, InfoWars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[01:19:14.542 --> 01:19:18.206]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have.

[01:21:28.837 --> 01:21:32.858]  Next hour, also, James O'Keefe is popping in on some huge news.
[01:21:32.858 --> 01:21:41.080]  Teachers are having students pledge allegiance to be, quote, gay, pledge allegiance to the rainbow flag, and to Marxism, and to Antifa.
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:45.141]  And they've got undercover reports showing this takeover of society.
[01:21:45.141 --> 01:21:47.941]  And I'm going to your phone calls in just a moment.
[01:21:47.941 --> 01:21:53.282]  I want to say something very important and very strong and very central.
[01:21:53.282 --> 01:21:55.823]  As I said last hour, people are desensitized.
[01:21:57.213 --> 01:22:01.656]  They don't know reality from unreality at a subconscious level.
[01:22:01.656 --> 01:22:08.762]  And I was just getting a glass of water during the break in the coffee room.
[01:22:08.762 --> 01:22:11.003]  And I was watching OAN that does a great job.
[01:22:12.165 --> 01:22:15.627]  With a Republican press conference, and I watched like three minutes of it.
[01:22:15.627 --> 01:22:17.889]  And it was just so milquetoast.
[01:22:17.889 --> 01:22:20.070]  It was so 20 years ago.
[01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:30.357]  We're under UN world government takeover, world IDs, poison injections, police dogs ripping people's faces off because they dare go outside.
[01:22:30.357 --> 01:22:31.959]  They're trying to bring the lockdowns back.
[01:22:31.959 --> 01:22:34.040]  Trudeau's announcing you won't have bank accounts.
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:34.921]  You don't take the shots.
[01:22:34.921 --> 01:22:36.181]  They're going to try that here.
[01:22:36.181 --> 01:22:38.243]  It's all happening.
[01:22:38.243 --> 01:22:40.124]  And people are like, well, that sounds crazy.
[01:22:40.124 --> 01:22:41.025]  Yeah, it's happening.
[01:22:42.665 --> 01:22:47.435]  And so we better get on a war footing here and call this out.
[01:22:47.435 --> 01:22:48.698]  Call out the Great Reset.
[01:22:48.698 --> 01:22:50.060]  Call out Klaus Schwab.
[01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:53.808]  Call it all out and declare war on it.
[01:22:54.807 --> 01:22:58.888]  Peacefully, in the information, and in non-compliance in lawsuits.
[01:22:58.888 --> 01:23:01.609]  Because the globalists are getting ready to stage false flags.
[01:23:01.609 --> 01:23:02.329]  It's all over the news.
[01:23:02.329 --> 01:23:04.710]  Oh, the British government, the Swiss government, the Australian government.
[01:23:04.710 --> 01:23:07.811]  Terrorists are getting ready to attack vaccine centers.
[01:23:07.811 --> 01:23:09.971]  They're going to blow up their own vaccine centers.
[01:23:09.971 --> 01:23:12.152]  So anybody protesting it will be called a terrorist.
[01:23:12.152 --> 01:23:13.152]  That's the next move.
[01:23:13.152 --> 01:23:15.193]  I've been telling you for months, and now they're getting ready.
[01:23:15.193 --> 01:23:16.693]  No, they're the terrorists.
[01:23:16.693 --> 01:23:19.354]  Hitting us with a bio-weapon like Joseph Mengele would do.
[01:23:20.054 --> 01:23:21.435]  They're the ones taking our rights.
[01:23:21.435 --> 01:23:23.156]  They're the ones trying to destroy our immune system.
[01:23:23.156 --> 01:23:28.920]  They're the ones trying to make us wear cult masks over our faces and breathe all these bacteria and get bacterial pneumonia.
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:30.702]  They have declared war on us.
[01:23:30.702 --> 01:23:32.963]  They are the terrorists.
[01:23:32.963 --> 01:23:38.007]  And I'm telling you their next moves.
[01:23:38.007 --> 01:23:40.889]  And so what are you going to do about it?
[01:23:40.889 --> 01:23:42.330]  Well, we're faced with something that's evil.
[01:23:42.330 --> 01:23:46.193]  The average person just can't get the grips that this is happening.
[01:23:46.193 --> 01:23:47.514]  A lot of folks are starting to do it.
[01:23:51.038 --> 01:23:52.819]  But God help us, man.
[01:23:52.819 --> 01:23:53.980]  God help us.
[01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:55.561]  This is the big move.
[01:23:55.561 --> 01:24:03.807]  And they admit, once you're trained to stay in your house, they're going to collapse the economy forever, put you in work brigades, and make you take shots every few months.
[01:24:03.807 --> 01:24:07.610]  I mean, the Australian government just announced it won't just be every five, it'll be all the time.
[01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:11.293]  And the woman's looking at the crowd like a rat, looking back and forth all crazy.
[01:24:11.293 --> 01:24:12.974]  This ain't some movie, folks.
[01:24:12.974 --> 01:24:14.475]  This is going down!
[01:24:14.475 --> 01:24:16.437]  Alright!
[01:24:17.554 --> 01:24:18.334]  Let's settle down here.
[01:24:18.334 --> 01:24:19.935]  This is just history happening.
[01:24:19.935 --> 01:24:22.377]  Let's talk to Scott and then to Tim.
[01:24:22.377 --> 01:24:24.098]  Scott from Texas.
[01:24:24.098 --> 01:24:26.919]  Welcome and thank you for calling.
[01:24:26.919 --> 01:24:27.920]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:29.501]  Good to be on the air.
[01:24:29.501 --> 01:24:31.062]  This is Scott in West Texas.
[01:24:31.062 --> 01:24:35.945]  It seems like I'm always calling you to get the word out on great researchers.
[01:24:35.945 --> 01:24:41.268]  I called a few months ago about the greater reset and grand theft world.
[01:24:41.268 --> 01:24:46.831]  I wanted to call in today about the gentleman who spoke yesterday about the approval process with Pfizer.
[01:24:47.518 --> 01:24:57.180]  I just wanted to clarify, Ryan Christian of the Latin American Vagabond did an amazing three-hour report on August 24th about it.
[01:24:57.180 --> 01:25:05.521]  He goes through every detail, everything on the fact sheet for the public and for the health administrators.
[01:25:05.521 --> 01:25:07.862]  So, it's the exact same formula.
[01:25:07.862 --> 01:25:12.883]  It's called BNT162B2 is the formula, and it's the same thing.
[01:25:12.883 --> 01:25:15.123]  This is just like a legalese for
[01:25:15.913 --> 01:25:19.575]  Because there's no thought of Comirnaty.
[01:25:19.575 --> 01:25:23.157]  They only have, you know, emergency use authorized.
[01:25:23.157 --> 01:25:23.717]  That's right.
[01:25:23.717 --> 01:25:27.940]  They just simply reauthorized the emergency and then lied because we're the enemy.
[01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:29.341]  Like they lie on PCR tests.
[01:25:29.341 --> 01:25:31.302]  Like they lie about everything.
[01:25:31.302 --> 01:25:33.703]  Just like they lie that the vaccine works when it doesn't.
[01:25:33.703 --> 01:25:37.545]  They lied and it's not been approved by the FDA.
[01:25:37.545 --> 01:25:39.827]  Isn't that incredible?
[01:25:39.827 --> 01:25:40.707]  It's incredible.
[01:25:40.707 --> 01:25:42.028]  It's just to cover their butts.
[01:25:42.611 --> 01:25:44.797]  So they still have the indemnity of it.
[01:25:44.797 --> 01:25:46.402]  It's insane.
[01:25:48.442 --> 01:25:52.205]  Reiner Vollnick, he's been doing some amazing stuff up in Germany.
[01:25:52.205 --> 01:25:55.087]  He's like a lawyer and he's learning about transhumanism.
[01:25:55.087 --> 01:26:00.750]  He had James Corbett on like a month ago and just his job.
[01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:04.433]  People hear all these other hosts like Rogan and everybody going, man, they're like Alex Jones now.
[01:26:04.433 --> 01:26:05.614]  No, they're not.
[01:26:05.614 --> 01:26:06.794]  It's all transhumanism.
[01:26:06.794 --> 01:26:07.795]  It's a globalist move.
[01:26:07.795 --> 01:26:08.856]  This is it.
[01:26:08.856 --> 01:26:11.758]  And so scientists, lawyers, everybody starts researching this.
[01:26:11.758 --> 01:26:14.499]  Psychiatrists, rocket scientists, it doesn't matter.
[01:26:14.499 --> 01:26:17.381]  You're going to see the same thing because that's what this is.
[01:26:17.381 --> 01:26:18.162]  A genetic
[01:26:19.622 --> 01:26:25.665]  Take over a globalist, genetic engineering, transhumanist revolution.
[01:26:25.665 --> 01:26:28.606]  And all you gotta do is just read their documents.
[01:26:28.606 --> 01:26:29.926]  It's incredible.
[01:26:29.926 --> 01:26:33.928]  Trudeau just said we're gonna lock down for the environment now.
[01:26:33.928 --> 01:26:36.369]  He just came out and said we're never opening.
[01:26:36.369 --> 01:26:37.249]  I'm a dictator.
[01:26:37.249 --> 01:26:40.230]  He actually says, I like, I want to be a dictator.
[01:26:40.230 --> 01:26:42.871]  It's insane.
[01:26:42.871 --> 01:26:45.932]  They've only been talking about it for the last 18 months about climate change.
[01:26:46.434 --> 01:26:47.996]  I get used to it.
[01:26:47.996 --> 01:26:49.638]  It's coming every two years.
[01:26:49.638 --> 01:26:53.883]  It's driving me crazy.
[01:26:53.883 --> 01:26:57.627]  Before you let me go, Alex, can I ask you to do one thing on air?
[01:26:57.627 --> 01:27:04.135]  Tell him that Green put out an article about the CDC deleting the VAERS database desk.
[01:27:06.941 --> 01:27:09.162]  And Gateway Pundit reported it.
[01:27:09.162 --> 01:27:12.304]  Give credit to Ryan Christian of the Latin American Vagabond.
[01:27:12.304 --> 01:27:13.105]  Oh, you're on air, brother.
[01:27:13.105 --> 01:27:14.145]  We love getting everybody credit.
[01:27:14.145 --> 01:27:14.626]  Okay, great.
[01:27:14.626 --> 01:27:17.747]  Yeah, we know they've been deleting a lot of deaths off the VAERS reporting system.
[01:27:17.747 --> 01:27:19.408]  I appreciate your call.
[01:27:19.408 --> 01:27:25.792]  Listen, I'm for everybody's credit, but when you see like a city council meeting, or you see a county commissioner's meeting,
[01:27:27.398 --> 01:27:36.225]  You notice the Patriot that gets up for three minutes and talks about how they're killing us, how they're attacking us, how we're not going to put up with it, energizes people, and gets everybody motivated.
[01:27:36.225 --> 01:27:41.288]  But then you'll see other political deals where they get up and thank people for three minutes.
[01:27:41.288 --> 01:27:47.113]  And so I never really get the, hey, let's give this guy credit, let's give that guy credit.
[01:27:47.113 --> 01:27:49.314]  I'll have these people on the show.
[01:27:49.314 --> 01:27:51.316]  I'll sit there and play clips, that's all I do.
[01:27:54.315 --> 01:27:58.158]  Just to call in and say, I want to give this person credit, I want to give that person credit.
[01:27:58.158 --> 01:27:59.239]  Wonderful!
[01:27:59.239 --> 01:28:00.360]  Wonderful!
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:03.203]  I'd rather talk about specifically what they're exposing.
[01:28:04.059 --> 01:28:06.760]  Okay, because the credit's going to be living.
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:08.940]  The credit's going to be having a job and a family.
[01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:11.681]  Because we're in a total war.
[01:28:11.681 --> 01:28:12.861]  So I appreciate your call.
[01:28:12.861 --> 01:28:16.422]  We're going to go to break and come back with Tim in Pennsylvania.
[01:28:16.422 --> 01:28:21.264]  I've got to rush through these calls because I want to get to everybody here today because James O'Keefe is going to be popping in.
[01:28:21.264 --> 01:28:24.584]  And we have a special guest, but I will get to every one of these calls.
[01:28:24.584 --> 01:28:26.065]  Start your engines.
[01:28:26.065 --> 01:28:26.585]  Get ready.
[01:28:26.585 --> 01:28:30.426]  I'm taking eight phone calls next segment.
[01:28:31.823 --> 01:28:32.904]  I'm taking eight phone calls.
[01:28:32.904 --> 01:28:34.925]  Tim is next.
[01:28:34.925 --> 01:28:36.105]  Then Rick.
[01:28:36.105 --> 01:28:37.826]  After that.
[01:28:37.826 --> 01:28:42.708]  And then right down the line, please stay with us.
[01:28:42.708 --> 01:28:44.009]  I want to give the audience credit.
[01:28:44.009 --> 01:28:45.650]  Hell, all are into that.
[01:28:45.650 --> 01:28:49.091]  From little old ladies to you name it that share the articles and share the videos.
[01:28:49.091 --> 01:28:51.853]  That's how we beat the globalists and defeat the New World Order.
[01:28:51.853 --> 01:28:52.713]  All right, we'll be right back.

[01:29:57.975 --> 01:30:02.840]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:04.882]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[01:30:04.882 --> 01:30:10.368]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[01:30:10.368 --> 01:30:11.469]  But we failed.
[01:30:11.469 --> 01:30:13.131]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[01:30:13.131 --> 01:30:14.993]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed.
[01:30:14.993 --> 01:30:20.218]  But they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization Great Reset.
[01:30:20.999 --> 01:30:29.922]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[01:30:29.922 --> 01:30:35.104]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.

[01:33:34.525 --> 01:33:39.247]  Gates Foundation working with Chinese government to promote Beijing's global medical clout.
[01:33:39.247 --> 01:33:40.327]  Yeah, he's a CHICOM agent.
[01:33:40.327 --> 01:33:42.208]  Told you that a long time ago.
[01:33:42.208 --> 01:33:44.148]  Absolutely huge news.
[01:33:44.148 --> 01:33:45.188]  The revolving door.
[01:33:45.188 --> 01:33:51.890]  Reuters reports two top vaccine regulators leave the US FDA to go to work for Big Pharma.
[01:33:51.890 --> 01:33:53.411]  Yeah, the payday is immediate.
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:54.940]  Wow!
[01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:57.821]  Let's go right back to your phone calls.
[01:33:57.821 --> 01:34:00.542]  Tim in Pennsylvania, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:34:00.542 --> 01:34:02.403]  Go ahead.
[01:34:02.403 --> 01:34:03.503]  Hey, Alex.
[01:34:03.503 --> 01:34:04.944]  God bless you, man.
[01:34:04.944 --> 01:34:05.944]  First time caller.
[01:34:05.944 --> 01:34:11.146]  10-year veteran with the listening Alex Jones.
[01:34:11.146 --> 01:34:17.688]  And all those info warriors out there, you know, it took me 10 years to finally buy products.
[01:34:17.688 --> 01:34:20.429]  And to be honest with you, I should have been buying it a long time ago.
[01:34:21.235 --> 01:34:22.796]  I got to support this man.
[01:34:22.796 --> 01:34:23.736]  I got to support.
[01:34:23.736 --> 01:34:26.297]  This is a safe haven for us guys.
[01:34:26.297 --> 01:34:27.257]  I have nowhere to go.
[01:34:27.257 --> 01:34:30.359]  I just lost two family members to this bioweapon.
[01:34:30.359 --> 01:34:33.560]  I'm going to try to hold my pose right here.
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:36.201]  But, just go ahead.
[01:34:36.201 --> 01:34:37.562]  Fund the Info War.
[01:34:37.562 --> 01:34:41.083]  Be part of the resistance.
[01:34:41.083 --> 01:34:45.565]  We have to fight this because we, I literally, we have nowhere to go.
[01:34:46.118 --> 01:34:46.599]  Absolutely.
[01:34:46.599 --> 01:34:52.545]  The Democratic Party is officially suing us, the same ones that sued Remington out of existence, but we're a media operation.
[01:34:52.545 --> 01:34:53.726]  It will be a lot harder.
[01:34:53.726 --> 01:34:54.507]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:34:54.507 --> 01:34:57.470]  Your support is critical, so you're the reason we're still on air.
[01:34:57.470 --> 01:34:59.672]  Tell us your stories about what happened.
[01:34:59.672 --> 01:35:02.255]  It says stories about your family.
[01:35:02.255 --> 01:35:05.318]  I'm going to make it, because I know at times it's not always time.
[01:35:05.318 --> 01:35:06.720]  I'm just going to tell you the way it is.
[01:35:07.629 --> 01:35:13.933]  Uh, my grandfather, um, which my grandmother's second husband, which he ended up being my real grandfather.
[01:35:13.933 --> 01:35:18.756]  I never knew my real grandfather, so this guy here was just tremendous to me.
[01:35:18.756 --> 01:35:20.958]  Anyways, I told Pap never take her shots.
[01:35:20.958 --> 01:35:21.838]  Don't take the shots.
[01:35:21.838 --> 01:35:22.719]  Don't do the shots.
[01:35:22.719 --> 01:35:23.920]  He never listened.
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:26.241]  He took the shot.
[01:35:26.241 --> 01:35:27.542]  He had a heart attack.
[01:35:27.542 --> 01:35:29.083]  They couldn't get a hold of him.
[01:35:29.083 --> 01:35:30.904]  He already had heart problems.
[01:35:30.904 --> 01:35:33.846]  They tried to, uh, revive him.
[01:35:33.846 --> 01:35:36.148]  They, uh, basically from the, uh,
[01:35:37.413 --> 01:35:40.374]  Hospital they could give them.
[01:35:40.374 --> 01:35:43.275]  They could shock him and there was no response.
[01:35:43.275 --> 01:35:47.637]  So me, my dad and my mom went down there, broke into the house and found him.
[01:35:47.637 --> 01:35:50.798]  And it was from the shot.
[01:35:50.798 --> 01:35:55.460]  With that said, during that process, my aunt got COVID.
[01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:57.981]  She took the shot.
[01:35:57.981 --> 01:36:00.142]  And at the same time.
[01:36:00.142 --> 01:36:06.144]  Again, my my brother is more like a brother, but by by rules he's my uncle.
[01:36:06.144 --> 01:36:06.524]  He's only.
[01:36:07.069 --> 01:36:07.929]  10 years older than me.
[01:36:07.929 --> 01:36:08.229]  I'm 41.
[01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:08.529]  He's 51.
[01:36:08.529 --> 01:36:12.370]  He ended up getting COVID off of her.
[01:36:12.370 --> 01:36:13.870]  She was in the COVID unit.
[01:36:13.870 --> 01:36:15.250]  I went down there to Allegheny.
[01:36:15.250 --> 01:36:16.631]  I'm going to bullhorn him now.
[01:36:16.631 --> 01:36:21.772]  Allegheny General, north side of Pittsburgh, went down there, was talking.
[01:36:21.772 --> 01:36:25.172]  They had her hooked up to a machine, etc.
[01:36:25.172 --> 01:36:28.333]  I told them to take her off it.
[01:36:28.333 --> 01:36:29.713]  Went home that day.
[01:36:29.713 --> 01:36:36.234]  During this process, my, again, my David got very sick off this and he's been fostering.
[01:36:36.690 --> 01:36:43.719]  My cousin's child, and he's just a heart of gold, good man, that never took the shot.
[01:36:43.719 --> 01:36:48.384]  He's one of us, but you don't know how it feels to breathe, not breathe.
[01:36:48.384 --> 01:36:53.491]  He tore in his prostate, got very sick, and he didn't communicate.
[01:36:53.491 --> 01:36:55.894]  I just buried him last week, one week today.
[01:36:56.508 --> 01:36:59.449]  Oh yeah, and it's definitely the shedding from the injection.
[01:36:59.449 --> 01:37:02.630]  That's in Pfizer's own study, they admit it.
[01:37:02.630 --> 01:37:05.752]  We see massive illness this year we didn't see last year, my friend.
[01:37:05.752 --> 01:37:08.533]  I'm so sorry to hear about all that devastation.
[01:37:08.533 --> 01:37:20.458]  And he came in, it is devastating, but anyways, I got the phone call last Saturday, not this one, but over a week ago now, and my sister called me.
[01:37:20.458 --> 01:37:23.779]  David was very, he was a man's man, he wanted to always
[01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:27.201]  Take things on its own shoulders.
[01:37:27.201 --> 01:37:33.984]  And I know from Uncle Art and my Aunt Teressa, during the funeral, the first thing they said, they shouldn't have re-incubated her.
[01:37:33.984 --> 01:37:35.464]  And I said, well, no one called me.
[01:37:35.464 --> 01:37:36.785]  No, I would have been down there.
[01:37:36.785 --> 01:37:38.005]  I would have stopped it.
[01:37:38.005 --> 01:37:38.826]  Well, that's it, brother.
[01:37:38.826 --> 01:37:40.126]  They don't give them ivermectin.
[01:37:40.126 --> 01:37:41.367]  They don't give them the steroids.
[01:37:41.367 --> 01:37:42.967]  They just, they just inhibit them and kill them.
[01:37:42.967 --> 01:37:44.448]  I'm so sorry to hear that.
[01:37:44.448 --> 01:37:45.388]  Spread the word.
[01:37:45.388 --> 01:37:45.988]  Expose them.
[01:37:45.988 --> 01:37:47.729]  Go protest that hospital.
[01:37:47.729 --> 01:37:48.789]  They'll never expect it.
[01:37:48.789 --> 01:37:51.911]  It's time to put the fear of God into them non-violently.
[01:37:51.911 --> 01:37:52.291]  Thank you.
[01:37:52.291 --> 01:37:52.691]  God bless.
[01:37:53.575 --> 01:37:56.116]  I could talk to these folks all day, but we've got to get everybody here.
[01:37:56.116 --> 01:37:59.838]  Let's go to Rick, who manages a biomedical company.
[01:37:59.838 --> 01:38:00.599]  Give us his take.
[01:38:00.599 --> 01:38:01.880]  Go ahead.
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:03.040]  Hey, Alex.
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:04.761]  Thank you for taking my call here.
[01:38:04.761 --> 01:38:05.462]  First time caller.
[01:38:05.462 --> 01:38:07.703]  I've been listening since I was like 14 years old.
[01:38:07.703 --> 01:38:08.583]  I wanted to give you a call.
[01:38:08.583 --> 01:38:09.844]  I manage a biomed company.
[01:38:09.844 --> 01:38:13.746]  We manage about 100 retirement facilities.
[01:38:13.746 --> 01:38:16.568]  I've been in and out of the lockdown zones.
[01:38:17.778 --> 01:38:21.680]  For COVID for over a year.
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:23.802]  I didn't get the COVID over that time.
[01:38:23.802 --> 01:38:29.725]  I credit a lot of your products for helping me have my immune system where it needs to be.
[01:38:29.725 --> 01:38:30.585]  And that's the thing.
[01:38:30.585 --> 01:38:33.587]  The immune system is the key, not the shot.
[01:38:33.587 --> 01:38:36.288]  So I wanted to focus on a subject.
[01:38:36.288 --> 01:38:41.111]  I think you focus every day on the information we need to know.
[01:38:41.111 --> 01:38:43.552]  But I want to share my story real quick.
[01:38:43.552 --> 01:38:44.793]  I hope I have time here for a second.
[01:38:46.912 --> 01:38:59.016]  I've developed this company from the ground up and I have a local, there's a local chain of hospitals that I got a very large contract with.
[01:38:59.016 --> 01:39:02.617]  Now we deal with hundreds of other businesses too, but this particular one is very valuable.
[01:39:02.617 --> 01:39:04.538]  And they're trying to make you take the deadly shots.
[01:39:04.943 --> 01:39:08.206]  They're trying to make us take the deadly shot, and here's the key.
[01:39:08.206 --> 01:39:09.968]  I'm not going to do it.
[01:39:09.968 --> 01:39:13.070]  I'm going to lose about $70,000 a year just to cut to the chase.
[01:39:13.070 --> 01:39:15.973]  I'm going to lose about $70,000 a year to my personal income.
[01:39:15.973 --> 01:39:19.136]  That's not a small chunk of change, as you are aware, Alex.
[01:39:19.136 --> 01:39:21.718]  I just want to talk for a minute about
[01:39:23.454 --> 01:39:25.855]  You gotta stand on something in your life.
[01:39:25.855 --> 01:39:30.416]  Oh yeah, it's hard to lose stuff up front, but we're gonna lose everything with these monsters.
[01:39:30.416 --> 01:39:32.237]  Doesn't it make it easier to make that decision now though?
[01:39:32.237 --> 01:39:35.238]  Because they're like, oh, now it'll be every five months.
[01:39:35.238 --> 01:39:37.859]  And in their own literature, they had this planned the whole time.
[01:39:37.859 --> 01:39:38.419]  This is sick.
[01:39:39.199 --> 01:39:44.862]  And the thing I want to focus on too, Alex, is that white-collar jobs are going to be gone.
[01:39:44.862 --> 01:39:48.523]  I make a good bit of money a year, which is fantastic, but guess what?
[01:39:48.523 --> 01:39:53.066]  Every single one of my customers I'm going to lose because I'm not going to be able to service them personally.
[01:39:53.066 --> 01:39:57.908]  I have other people that work for me that can service them because they're dumb enough to take the shot, but I'm not going to.
[01:39:58.467 --> 01:40:01.869]  So that's the that's the problem is that those white collar jobs.
[01:40:01.869 --> 01:40:10.453]  So people that are listening right now, just be aware that if you are a white collar job or you're working in a medical facility, it's not it's not if it's when.
[01:40:10.453 --> 01:40:12.354]  So you have to make that decision.
[01:40:12.354 --> 01:40:16.696]  So I urge everyone to develop a level of skills outside your own.
[01:40:16.696 --> 01:40:17.197]  So if you're a
[01:40:18.277 --> 01:40:24.642]  You know, if you're a doctor, you know, so on and so forth, try to develop a level of skills outside of your work environment.
[01:40:24.642 --> 01:40:26.023]  Because guess what?
[01:40:26.023 --> 01:40:31.527]  If this is I believe this is the first brick to the road to the mark of the beast, if it's not the mark of the beast,
[01:40:31.932 --> 01:40:34.254]  We're going to be in a situation where we can't go to the store.
[01:40:34.254 --> 01:40:35.394]  We can't work.
[01:40:35.394 --> 01:40:36.655]  Well, that's their plan.
[01:40:36.655 --> 01:40:37.896]  And listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:40:37.896 --> 01:40:38.837]  God bless you.
[01:40:38.837 --> 01:40:39.877]  And I can talk to you guys forever.
[01:40:39.877 --> 01:40:40.818]  Look at these callers.
[01:40:40.818 --> 01:40:42.959]  Amy, two family members took Vax.
[01:40:42.959 --> 01:40:44.881]  Both have cancer now.
[01:40:44.881 --> 01:40:46.422]  And they admit the vaccine gives you cancer.
[01:40:46.422 --> 01:40:49.404]  It's like it's just hidden in plain view.
[01:40:49.404 --> 01:40:52.166]  Caleb, ivermectin saved his aunt.
[01:40:52.166 --> 01:40:55.868]  Sean, arrested for not wearing a mask at daughter's school in Texas.
[01:40:55.868 --> 01:40:59.270]  George, school vaccinating students.
[01:40:59.270 --> 01:41:01.432]  Tricia, mandates for restaurants.
[01:41:02.506 --> 01:41:05.388]  Doug, COVID Info Wars is truth.
[01:41:05.388 --> 01:41:09.151]  Deborah, the vaccine's shedding, mother died, hospital tyranny.
[01:41:09.151 --> 01:41:13.495]  Colin, Virginia, parents trying to get ivermectin in hospital.
[01:41:13.495 --> 01:41:19.560]  Digital Dave, COVID, sharing information with Info Wars.
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:30.108]  And I said I could take callers, I just got to two this segment, and I was gonna do nothing but calls this hour, but then James O'Keefe was able to pop in, but I will get to all your calls.
[01:41:30.108 --> 01:41:30.849]  In fact, I'll jam in.
[01:41:32.250 --> 01:41:39.296]  I'll jam in as many as I can ahead of this next special guest, but we have this big guest as well, but these calls are more important, quite frankly, than most guests.
[01:41:39.296 --> 01:41:45.541]  I mean, we need to hear from this whistleblower doctor that exposed Fauci, that they tried to, you know, basically kill.
[01:41:45.541 --> 01:41:47.162]  She's important, but you are all very important.
[01:41:48.163 --> 01:42:05.536]  To you, O'Keefe's usually five minutes late, so I'll come back from break, probably hit a call or two, and then let O'Keefe briefly and get the latest on how they're getting undercover, these teachers demanding students pledge allegiance to the gay flag, pledge allegiance to Antifa, pledge allegiance to Marxist-Leninist garbage, but let me just get a plug in since I'm not going to do it next segment.
[01:42:07.133 --> 01:42:13.476]  If you need high quality storable food, we've got the best storable food at the best prices ready to ship to you at InfoWarStore.com.

[01:42:44.939 --> 01:42:52.727]  We'll be right back on the other side with James O'Keefe and just all this crazy stuff that's going on.
[01:42:52.727 --> 01:42:56.131]  The latest video is on InfoWars.com that Project Veritas just got.
[01:42:56.806 --> 01:43:00.807]  People can't really spend money anywhere better than MyPillow.com with promo code ALEX.

[01:43:18.814 --> 01:43:24.218]  The best thing, I think, all you guys, everyone out there, you can get my book for $9.99.
[01:43:24.218 --> 01:43:26.879]  My book will help anybody out there in addiction.

[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:32.483]  Right now, all of the specials, I used to run one here and one there.
[01:43:32.483 --> 01:43:33.644]  I put them all on there.
[01:43:33.644 --> 01:43:35.505]  The lowest prices you've ever seen.
[01:43:35.505 --> 01:43:36.686]  And we have our new bed.
[01:43:36.686 --> 01:43:39.088]  Everybody, I don't know if you've seen our bed infomercial.
[01:43:39.088 --> 01:43:41.029]  I developed this bed over a year and a half.
[01:43:41.029 --> 01:43:42.870]  Best mattress you'll ever sleep on.
[01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:45.492]  It's a combination of coils and patented foam.
[01:43:45.492 --> 01:43:46.793]  And this, they're amazing.
[01:43:46.793 --> 01:43:47.593]  There's nothing better.
[01:43:49.214 --> 01:43:51.555]  The cost is not high and you support freedom.
[01:43:51.555 --> 01:43:53.396]  MyPillow.com, promo code Alex.
[01:43:53.396 --> 01:43:56.998]  You've got so many great products and we're just really proud of the work you're doing, Mike.
[01:43:56.998 --> 01:44:01.860]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:03.921]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[01:44:03.921 --> 01:44:09.404]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[01:44:09.404 --> 01:44:10.044]  But we failed.
[01:44:10.484 --> 01:44:12.145]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[01:44:12.145 --> 01:44:14.006]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed.
[01:44:14.006 --> 01:44:20.029]  But they are going ahead with their full operational de-industrialization, Great Reset.
[01:44:20.029 --> 01:44:28.414]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[01:44:28.954 --> 01:44:34.476]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[01:44:34.476 --> 01:44:37.037]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storable food.
[01:44:37.037 --> 01:44:41.798]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarestore.com.
[01:44:41.798 --> 01:44:47.400]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:54.622]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits, because believe me, serious times are coming.
[01:44:54.622 --> 01:44:56.243]  Get ready at infowarestore.com.
[01:44:58.168 --> 01:45:00.549]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[01:45:00.549 --> 01:45:02.290]  It's very bittersweet.
[01:45:02.290 --> 01:45:05.271]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[01:45:05.271 --> 01:45:06.511]  And now we have a lot of credibility.
[01:45:06.511 --> 01:45:07.431]  But I don't care about that.
[01:45:07.431 --> 01:45:09.492]  I care about beating the new world order.
[01:45:09.492 --> 01:45:14.194]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[01:45:14.194 --> 01:45:17.535]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[01:45:17.535 --> 01:45:19.056]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[01:45:19.056 --> 01:45:20.076]  But let's just say this.
[01:45:20.256 --> 01:45:21.556]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[01:45:21.556 --> 01:45:24.657]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[01:45:24.657 --> 01:45:28.299]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at mfulworthstore.com.
[01:45:28.299 --> 01:45:30.880]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:34.061]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[01:45:34.061 --> 01:45:34.921]  Do they fund freedom?
[01:45:34.921 --> 01:45:36.021]  No, a lot of them don't.
[01:45:36.021 --> 01:45:42.483]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[01:45:42.483 --> 01:45:43.884]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[01:45:44.204 --> 01:45:47.610]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[01:45:47.610 --> 01:45:50.755]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[01:45:50.755 --> 01:45:57.908]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[01:45:58.516 --> 01:46:00.037]  I'm not funded by George Soros.
[01:46:00.037 --> 01:46:01.978]  I'm not funded by the Democratic Party.
[01:46:01.978 --> 01:46:03.178]  I'm funded by you.
[01:46:03.178 --> 01:46:04.339]  We got great products you need.

[01:46:33.485 --> 01:46:34.086]  Deep Earth Crystal.
[01:46:34.326 --> 01:46:36.487]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:16.650 --> 01:47:21.601]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:31.022]  Well, James O'Keefe is at it again.
[01:47:31.022 --> 01:47:38.147]  You've seen all these videos coming out of teachers saying, I make my students pledge allegiance to the gay flag and to Marxism.
[01:47:38.147 --> 01:47:39.308]  Well, now they've got a new video.
[01:47:39.308 --> 01:47:40.889]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:47:40.889 --> 01:47:43.792]  Cali high school teacher reveals he's Antifa.
[01:47:43.792 --> 01:47:46.434]  And he's turning children into revolutionaries.
[01:47:46.434 --> 01:47:47.194]  It's a powerful...
[01:47:48.251 --> 01:47:50.514]  10-minute report at Project Veritas.
[01:47:50.514 --> 01:47:51.715]  I suggest everybody go watch it.
[01:47:51.715 --> 01:47:59.865]  But while we have James O'Keefe for just one segment, I want to pick his brain about this and some of the other work they're doing and what he expects to be coming out soon.
[01:47:59.865 --> 01:48:04.350]  I always like to get a little bit of a first look or idea of what's coming next as well.
[01:48:04.350 --> 01:48:07.654]  But congratulations on another big find.
[01:48:07.654 --> 01:48:08.295]  Give us the latest.
[01:48:10.060 --> 01:48:10.680]  Thanks Alex.
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:12.981]  This is a teacher in Sacramento, California.
[01:48:12.981 --> 01:48:19.204]  He teaches Advanced Placement, I'm reading here, Intercom High School.
[01:48:19.204 --> 01:48:22.765]  He says he has 180 days to turn students into revolutionaries.
[01:48:22.765 --> 01:48:30.008]  This was given to us by a whistleblower in the school, had taken pictures inside the classroom.
[01:48:30.737 --> 01:48:32.919]  I mean this guy looks like a caricature of what you might think.
[01:48:53.579 --> 01:48:56.662]  A teacher would be doing if he was in Antifa.
[01:48:56.662 --> 01:49:02.226]  Probably one of the most shocking things we've ever seen come out of a school, at least as far as I've seen.
[01:49:02.226 --> 01:49:05.069]  And parents are outraged about this, Alex.
[01:49:05.069 --> 01:49:08.271]  This just sort of broke an hour or two ago.
[01:49:08.271 --> 01:49:10.673]  You have teachers and parents are outraged.
[01:49:10.673 --> 01:49:13.736]  The principal is not happy about this in the school.
[01:49:14.762 --> 01:49:18.084]  And I'm seeing reports on the Facebook page for the school.
[01:49:18.084 --> 01:49:20.265]  People are really upset.
[01:49:20.265 --> 01:49:21.946]  We think this teacher will be fired.
[01:49:21.946 --> 01:49:23.107]  We're looking for a reaction.
[01:49:23.107 --> 01:49:25.108]  There's a school board meeting tomorrow.
[01:49:25.108 --> 01:49:29.390]  The reason we do this, aside from the importance of exposing this one individual, is
[01:49:29.950 --> 01:49:35.473]  It's going to inspire a lot more people on the inside of these organizations and institutions to come to Project Veritas.
[01:49:35.473 --> 01:49:41.115]  But, Alex, maybe one of the most shocking things we've seen inside schools today released by Project Veritas.
[01:49:41.115 --> 01:49:43.856]  It's amazing, and for radio listeners, they can't see it.
[01:49:43.856 --> 01:49:46.578]  They've got to go to projectveritas.com and watch it, or infowars.com.
[01:49:48.302 --> 01:49:55.668]  Looking at the images, Mao Zedong on the wall, Antifa, all this really dangerous communist stuff.
[01:49:55.668 --> 01:49:58.750]  Mao obviously has killed more people than Hitler and Stalin combined.
[01:49:58.750 --> 01:50:10.199]  And then on his arm, he's got Ing Sok tattooed from 1984, the fictitious evil overlord party that kills everybody.
[01:50:10.199 --> 01:50:12.020]  I mean, this guy is so creepy.
[01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:15.363]  He read 1984 and he thinks it's a utopian novel.
[01:50:15.996 --> 01:50:20.859]  Yeah, most people, I mean, yes, yes, that's a very astute observation.
[01:50:20.859 --> 01:50:27.323]  Most people who read 1984, they're critical of that dystopia.
[01:50:27.323 --> 01:50:33.787]  They don't want the world to be that way, but this man actually wants it to be 1984.
[01:50:33.787 --> 01:50:37.370]  So we did confront him also, Alex, in the end of this video.
[01:50:37.370 --> 01:50:42.273]  We found him in California, opened microphone and said, what are you doing?
[01:50:42.273 --> 01:50:44.234]  And he claimed that we were, quote, harassing him.
[01:50:45.177 --> 01:50:47.419]  And he was wearing orange glasses.
[01:50:47.419 --> 01:50:49.160]  He had a hammer and sickle shirt on.
[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:50.741]  He was wearing the shirt.
[01:50:50.741 --> 01:50:53.563]  So we put that out as well.
[01:50:53.563 --> 01:50:54.663]  School board meeting tomorrow.
[01:50:54.663 --> 01:50:57.605]  Project Veritas will be attending the school board meeting.
[01:50:57.605 --> 01:50:58.926]  People are outraged.
[01:50:58.926 --> 01:51:00.127]  The principal's not happy.
[01:51:00.945 --> 01:51:09.533]  About this, and I think this man is going to become the face of public education in California unless something is done about him, Alex.
[01:51:09.533 --> 01:51:10.134]  And there you have it.
[01:51:10.134 --> 01:51:11.455]  That's him being confronted.
[01:51:11.455 --> 01:51:20.863]  He says, quote, I don't feel comfortable with this, which is ironic because he says in the undercover recording that he wants people to feel uncomfortable in his classroom.
[01:51:20.863 --> 01:51:22.125]  You can't make it up, Alex.
[01:51:22.742 --> 01:51:24.062]  Well, that's what these bullies do.
[01:51:24.062 --> 01:51:26.483]  They go out and attack prayer meetings.
[01:51:26.483 --> 01:51:34.825]  They go to salons where women in the club don't want men in the hot tub with them in the ladies' room.
[01:51:34.825 --> 01:51:39.206]  And they go and beat people up, and they want to attack us and stop our speech.
[01:51:39.206 --> 01:51:41.486]  But then when you talk to them, they're like, I'm being harassed!
[01:51:41.486 --> 01:51:42.727]  I'm going to call the police!
[01:51:42.727 --> 01:51:43.707]  You're being mean to me!
[01:51:44.758 --> 01:51:48.961]  Well, that's the example of George Orwell's, what we call, double-think.
[01:51:48.961 --> 01:51:50.382]  That's the double-think in 1984.
[01:51:50.382 --> 01:51:53.085]  To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing them.
[01:51:53.085 --> 01:52:00.630]  To forget any fact that has become inconvenient and then it becomes necessary to draw it back from oblivion for just so long it is as needed.
[01:52:00.630 --> 01:52:04.834]  To deny the existence of objective reality and to take account of the reality
[01:52:05.374 --> 01:52:06.495]  Which one denies.
[01:52:06.495 --> 01:52:08.496]  That's what George Orwell wrote in 1984.
[01:52:08.496 --> 01:52:17.603]  So to have this teacher quite literally saying in the video that we recorded him in the coffee shop there in California, but I want to make my students feel uncomfortable.
[01:52:17.603 --> 01:52:20.905]  If they don't like Antifa, well, you know, screw them.
[01:52:20.905 --> 01:52:24.668]  And then to have him tell our journalist, well, you're making me feel uncomfortable.
[01:52:24.668 --> 01:52:28.090]  It's kind of a psychological illness.
[01:52:28.090 --> 01:52:30.032]  It's a sign of mental illness.
[01:52:30.032 --> 01:52:34.655]  And clearly that's what we're dealing with here to a certain extent to have someone
[01:52:35.692 --> 01:52:40.333]  You know, believe these ideologies and contradict themselves so clearly.
[01:52:40.333 --> 01:52:43.554]  I'm really looking forward to seeing Alex, the reaction from the school district.
[01:52:43.554 --> 01:52:46.755]  I know there will be a reaction in the next few hours.
[01:52:46.755 --> 01:52:50.115]  So all I can say is stay tuned for that to happen.
[01:52:50.115 --> 01:53:01.718]  And of course, this rat-like creature thinks that, there it is on video, he thinks that he is going to get this big great job in the future communist utopia.
[01:53:02.779 --> 01:53:06.862]  And he's so ignorant, he's got a 1984 tattoo on his arm thinking that's a good thing.
[01:53:06.862 --> 01:53:10.104]  I mean, like you said, this is just pure mental illness.
[01:53:10.104 --> 01:53:13.586]  And these guys are LARPing like there's no wonder.
[01:53:13.586 --> 01:53:14.367]  You're absolutely right.
[01:53:14.367 --> 01:53:17.889]  It is funny in a sick way.
[01:53:17.889 --> 01:53:22.012]  The Insoc tattoo is unbelievable.
[01:53:22.012 --> 01:53:29.977]  And again, this is something he said, why aren't people just taking up arms, taking up arms against the state?
[01:53:30.632 --> 01:53:35.695]  Alex, you wouldn't believe how many people are reaching out to Project Veritas on the inside of everywhere.
[01:53:35.695 --> 01:53:40.118]  Pharmaceutical companies, Disney, government institutions, federal government, people are pissed.
[01:53:40.118 --> 01:53:40.599]  People have had enough.
[01:54:00.782 --> 01:54:05.944]  And there's a lot going on in the world right now, overseas, here.
[01:54:05.944 --> 01:54:13.887]  There's a lot of news happening every day, but the good news is, the silver lining is, people are really waking up and they want to do something about it.
[01:54:13.887 --> 01:54:24.572]  We wouldn't know about this man, this Gabriel Guy, public high school teacher in Sacramento, California, but not for someone on the inside of that classroom reaching out to us and taking pictures.
[01:54:24.572 --> 01:54:29.334]  So there is a lot of evil in the world, and there's a lot of sick people in the world, but there's also a lot of good people in the world.
[01:54:29.915 --> 01:54:34.040]  Who are finally doing something about the problems at Veritas.
[01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:41.409]  We have dozens of reporters with cameras now can go out and corroborate the information like you're seeing and hearing right now.
[01:54:41.409 --> 01:54:42.531]  We went out to California.
[01:54:42.531 --> 01:54:43.973]  We met with this man to coffee shop.
[01:54:43.973 --> 01:54:44.734]  We got him to admit.
[01:54:45.299 --> 01:54:46.420]  What he's doing.
[01:54:46.420 --> 01:54:51.122]  So I know I know people are really cynical and upset about what's happening in this country.
[01:54:51.122 --> 01:54:58.705]  But I guarantee you that every week Veritas will be releasing another bombshell bigger and bigger also on the vaccine and COVID.
[01:54:58.705 --> 01:55:02.547]  We're working on that as well and we'll have some information for you shortly about that.
[01:55:02.547 --> 01:55:03.267]  Well, absolutely.
[01:55:03.267 --> 01:55:04.487]  This is a huge story.
[01:55:04.487 --> 01:55:07.769]  I just know you've always got so much incredible stuff coming.
[01:55:07.769 --> 01:55:11.891]  So now you really wet my appetite on the vaccine.
[01:55:11.891 --> 01:55:14.152]  Give us a little hint what you got cooking.
[01:55:14.152 --> 01:55:14.612]  Well, I think
[01:55:15.535 --> 01:55:23.658]  I think we've had some people reach out to us within pharmaceutical companies, within the federal government, with some of these agencies, and they're upset about what's happening.
[01:55:23.658 --> 01:55:26.798]  A lot of people are refusing to be vaccinated.
[01:55:26.798 --> 01:55:34.201]  But you saw what we exposed with CNN and the Charlie Chester tape back in April, where they admitted they wanted more people to die to get more ratings.
[01:55:34.201 --> 01:55:34.741]  Yes.
[01:55:34.741 --> 01:55:42.423]  So I think it's important for us to expose the real motivation behind why they're pushing this on us.
[01:55:42.423 --> 01:55:44.644]  In places like New York, where I'm in New York State,
[01:55:45.245 --> 01:55:54.369]  September 13th, New York City is requiring you have a passport card to get into restaurants, and a lot of people are not going to want to be vaccinated.
[01:55:54.369 --> 01:55:57.730]  So I think it's going to be a very interesting few weeks.
[01:55:57.730 --> 01:56:11.196]  I can't tell you exactly what we're doing, but what I can tell you is that people on the inside of these pharmaceutical companies and federal government agencies that are effectively requiring all this to happen are reaching out to me with stories to tell.
[01:56:12.049 --> 01:56:18.854]  So if you're watching this program, what I would like you to do is to reach out to us if you're on the inside of these companies.
[01:56:18.854 --> 01:56:20.235]  I know you're out there, Alex.
[01:56:20.235 --> 01:56:27.200]  Your audience, you have people watching InfoWars that work for the federal government, that work for pharmaceutical companies.
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:31.163]  Contact me at VeritasTipsAtProtonMail.com.
[01:56:31.163 --> 01:56:35.166]  V-E-R-I-T-A-S TipsAtProtonMail.com.
[01:56:35.166 --> 01:56:38.969]  Some of our best stories come from whistleblowers who watch InfoWars.
[01:56:39.688 --> 01:56:44.651]  And who are, you know, who are a fan of yours, Alex, so we would love for you to contact us.
[01:56:44.651 --> 01:56:45.271]  Absolutely!
[01:56:45.271 --> 01:56:48.753]  ProjectVeritas.com if they forget the email address and want to find it.
[01:56:48.753 --> 01:56:54.136]  I just love seeing the great work, how you guys work so hard, how you're organized, and it's just so exciting to
[01:56:54.916 --> 01:56:57.117]  Again, I believe in vaccines if they're real and clean.
[01:56:57.117 --> 01:56:58.037]  This doesn't work.
[01:56:58.037 --> 01:56:59.417]  It's making people sick.
[01:56:59.417 --> 01:57:01.138]  I think Trump needs to wake up to that.
[01:57:01.138 --> 01:57:03.198]  But, you know, regardless, he's not the president right now.
[01:57:03.198 --> 01:57:05.879]  We've got the puppet Biden just in 30-second closing.
[01:57:05.879 --> 01:57:13.901]  Do you think Biden survives to the end of the year, or do you think they do the 25th Amendment?
[01:57:13.901 --> 01:57:15.062]  That's the question.
[01:57:15.062 --> 01:57:17.082]  Hard for me to predict that one.
[01:57:17.082 --> 01:57:19.203]  I mean, there's enough out there already to
[01:57:19.921 --> 01:57:24.804]  to damage him politically, but my prediction is I don't know if he makes it.
[01:57:24.804 --> 01:57:26.605]  I don't know if he makes it a full term.
[01:57:26.605 --> 01:57:27.985]  He's struggling so much.
[01:57:27.985 --> 01:57:30.126]  I don't think he makes it a full term, but I think he's like an undead zombie.
[01:57:30.126 --> 01:57:31.347]  I think he'll crawl into 2022.
[01:57:31.347 --> 01:57:32.668]  I agree with you.
[01:57:32.668 --> 01:57:33.228]  All right.
[01:57:33.228 --> 01:57:34.689]  James O'Keefe, amazing job.
[01:57:34.689 --> 01:57:37.510]  Project Veritas, we salute you, brother.
[01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:38.070]  Stay tuned.
[01:57:38.070 --> 01:57:38.731]  Thank you.
[01:57:38.731 --> 01:57:39.131]  We will.
[01:57:39.131 --> 01:57:39.591]  Don't worry.
[01:57:39.591 --> 01:57:40.832]  There goes James O'Keefe.
[01:57:40.832 --> 01:57:41.092]  All right.
[01:57:41.092 --> 01:57:44.674]  We've got the big whistleblower speaking of vaccines coming on next.
[01:57:50.177 --> 01:57:51.438]  Jacob in Ohio.
[01:57:51.438 --> 01:57:52.258]  Welcome, go ahead.
[01:57:52.258 --> 01:57:53.559]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[01:57:53.559 --> 01:57:54.139]  Good, Bob.
[01:57:54.139 --> 01:57:55.219]  Great last caller.
[01:57:55.219 --> 01:57:58.281]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[01:57:58.281 --> 01:58:03.983]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[01:58:03.983 --> 01:58:05.764]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[01:58:06.104 --> 01:58:07.745]  Alright, Eric in New Hampshire.
[01:58:07.745 --> 01:58:08.685]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[01:58:08.685 --> 01:58:09.046]  Go ahead.
[01:58:09.046 --> 01:58:10.586]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:58:10.586 --> 01:58:13.628]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[01:58:13.628 --> 01:58:15.289]  The X2 does wonders.
[01:58:15.289 --> 01:58:16.509]  I recommend it to everybody.
[01:58:16.509 --> 01:58:17.630]  You're on the fence about it.
[01:58:17.630 --> 01:58:18.410]  Get off the fence.
[01:58:18.410 --> 01:58:19.071]  Get the product.
[01:58:19.071 --> 01:58:20.491]  Support the InfoWars.
[01:58:20.491 --> 01:58:21.792]  Tyler in Maine.
[01:58:21.792 --> 01:58:22.452]  You're on the air.
[01:58:22.452 --> 01:58:23.013]  Thanks for rolling.
[01:58:23.013 --> 01:58:23.373]  Go ahead.
[01:58:23.373 --> 01:58:25.074]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[01:58:25.074 --> 01:58:25.654]  It's an honor.
[01:58:25.834 --> 01:58:26.655]  Honor, talk to you.
[01:58:26.655 --> 01:58:27.796]  Awesome.
[01:58:27.796 --> 01:58:31.400]  So, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the products.
[01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:33.482]  Alpha Power, even at 29.
[01:58:33.482 --> 01:58:35.965]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[01:58:35.965 --> 01:58:37.326]  And it helps in the bedroom.
[01:58:37.326 --> 01:58:39.008]  So, just number one for a few of the areas.
[01:58:39.008 --> 01:58:39.889]  Well, it definitely works.
[01:58:39.889 --> 01:58:41.611]  It's not a joke.
[01:58:41.611 --> 01:58:42.351]  Absolutely.
[01:58:48.007 --> 01:59:04.257]  In late August, InfoWars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[01:59:04.257 --> 01:59:07.919]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[01:59:07.919 --> 01:59:14.543]  It's a checkbox that everybody needs to have taken care of, right along with water filtration, self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[01:59:15.163 --> 01:59:19.246]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in now.
[01:59:19.246 --> 01:59:21.987]  We're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[01:59:21.987 --> 01:59:22.808]  It's high quality.
[01:59:22.808 --> 01:59:26.010]  It's very, very low cost at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:59:26.010 --> 01:59:33.394]  Because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[01:59:33.394 --> 01:59:39.538]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the InfoWar at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:59:39.538 --> 01:59:44.041]  That's how you fight the Great Reset, is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.
[01:59:44.301 --> 01:59:51.347]  So get prepared now at m4warstore.com!
[01:59:51.347 --> 01:59:53.989]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:11.243 --> 02:00:13.024]  All right, we're taking your phone calls right now.
[02:00:13.024 --> 02:00:16.485]  I have a special guest joining us, and I'll continue with your phone calls if you can hold.
[02:00:16.485 --> 02:00:20.406]  I really appreciate everybody loading the phones up, and it's a catch-22.
[02:00:20.406 --> 02:00:23.927]  Amy in New York says, two family members took Vax.
[02:00:23.927 --> 02:00:25.608]  Both have cancer now.
[02:00:25.608 --> 02:00:27.409]  Yeah, like Roger Stone's wife and so many others.
[02:00:27.409 --> 02:00:29.710]  They even say, oh, you might get cancer, but it's no big deal.
[02:00:29.710 --> 02:00:31.710]  Wow, I'm sorry to hear that, Amy.
[02:00:31.710 --> 02:00:34.151]  Tell us what's happened up there in New York.
[02:00:34.151 --> 02:00:34.511]  Hey, Alex.
[02:00:34.511 --> 02:00:36.152]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:00:36.152 --> 02:00:37.512]  I actually know three people.
[02:00:37.512 --> 02:00:39.553]  Two of them are family members.
[02:00:40.046 --> 02:00:42.929]  They're both women under the age of 45.
[02:00:42.929 --> 02:00:45.831]  Both have young children.
[02:00:45.831 --> 02:00:48.514]  Obviously, I'm not a scientist or a doctor.
[02:00:48.514 --> 02:00:58.002]  I couldn't say that I definitely know, but I'm pretty intuitive, and I just have that feeling like there's no such thing as coincidence, and I feel like that's why they try to teach us that 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[02:00:58.002 --> 02:01:03.206]  They don't want us to make tons of things, but I'm not stupid.
[02:01:03.206 --> 02:01:05.889]  I know for a fact that there's no such thing as coincidence.
[02:01:07.625 --> 02:01:18.112]  Well, ma'am, I mean, they admit that it's causing lymphoma cancer, lung cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, all sorts of other stuff.
[02:01:18.112 --> 02:01:20.693]  I mean, they say it actually may trigger it.
[02:01:20.693 --> 02:01:22.574]  That's a side effect.
[02:01:22.574 --> 02:01:24.516]  So what type of cancers did they get?
[02:01:24.516 --> 02:01:31.100]  So my sister-in-law, she had blood work back in February and everything was fine.
[02:01:31.100 --> 02:01:35.123]  And between then, got both jabs, and now she has stage 4.
[02:01:36.915 --> 02:01:42.757]  They're not even 100% sure really where it all originated.
[02:01:42.757 --> 02:01:59.643]  My cousin, she just got diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and I was listening to her show the other day and forgive me for not knowing the doctor's name, but when she was speaking I just had that feeling like this is what happened.
[02:01:59.643 --> 02:02:02.805]  Like I just knew and I know that no doctor is going to say that.
[02:02:02.805 --> 02:02:03.625]  I've talked to some nurses.
[02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:14.509]  You know, they think they're doing the right thing, so I can't even knock anybody because... And see, they won't admit as the cancer triples that they did it, because they won't admit they're heroes!
[02:02:14.509 --> 02:02:17.051]  So they can't... And of course, they'll get the shots and die too.
[02:02:17.051 --> 02:02:19.393]  I mean, they just can't help themselves.
[02:02:19.393 --> 02:02:29.381]  Right, but because this is so, like, you know, the mainstream media is what people see first and have the people, you know, billionaires trying to fully listen to a show like yours.
[02:02:29.381 --> 02:02:30.942]  So they don't really get the message.
[02:02:30.942 --> 02:02:32.744]  Plus, you know, your name's been smeared.
[02:02:33.487 --> 02:02:36.908]  For at least the last 10 years that I've heard your name.
[02:02:36.908 --> 02:02:44.812]  Well, Amy, I'm just glad you told to tell your testimony and hopefully people will take this show today and share it and share this clip and save some lives.
[02:02:44.812 --> 02:02:48.573]  So keep warning people and God bless you and I'm sorry for your friends troubles.
[02:02:48.573 --> 02:02:50.634]  Yeah, these people are monsters.
[02:02:50.634 --> 02:02:54.956]  Let's talk to Caleb in Texas has an ivermectin story.
[02:02:54.956 --> 02:02:55.556]  Caleb, go ahead.
[02:02:56.823 --> 02:03:02.445]  Hey Alex, I called in about basically saving my aunt from the healthcare system with ivermectin.
[02:03:02.445 --> 02:03:04.026]  I had to drive two states to do it.
[02:03:04.026 --> 02:03:06.527]  But brother, while I was on hold, I got inspired by something.
[02:03:06.527 --> 02:03:10.009]  I just got to share it, man, and pray that it reaches a few people.
[02:03:10.009 --> 02:03:10.889]  Under Bush Sr.
[02:03:10.889 --> 02:03:11.469]  was bad.
[02:03:11.469 --> 02:03:12.350]  Clinton was bad.
[02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:12.950]  Bush Jr.
[02:03:12.950 --> 02:03:13.410]  was bad.
[02:03:13.410 --> 02:03:19.133]  But it was particularly under Obama that we saw the new tactic of the cascade of scandals.
[02:03:19.133 --> 02:03:22.914]  Nothing ever gets done about one scandal because they just roll into the next one.
[02:03:22.914 --> 02:03:26.376]  And we've got to pick our hill to stand on until we see justice.
[02:03:26.863 --> 02:03:30.425]  And I think that hill is the Ivermectin and COVID.
[02:03:30.425 --> 02:03:35.689]  If you go to the National Institute of Health website, NIH.gov, they have a search bar.
[02:03:35.689 --> 02:03:45.776]  In that search bar, type in Ivermectin, comma, COVID, and you get paper after paper after paper of how ridiculously safe and how ridiculously effective Ivermectin is.
[02:03:45.776 --> 02:03:50.779]  And the very same institution lies and says it isn't because they want high death rates because they're a bunch of ghouls.
[02:03:50.779 --> 02:03:53.201]  And I meant to start the show with what you just said today.
[02:03:54.517 --> 02:03:57.318]  The forced inoculation to the medical tyranny is everything.
[02:03:57.318 --> 02:03:59.618]  They want to distract us with all the other scandals.
[02:03:59.618 --> 02:04:00.879]  This is the big one.
[02:04:00.879 --> 02:04:02.499]  This is what they're rolling out.
[02:04:02.499 --> 02:04:04.780]  Their global ID, their control system.
[02:04:04.780 --> 02:04:05.640]  This is it.
[02:04:05.640 --> 02:04:09.201]  And we cannot get distracted by the other scandals.
[02:04:09.201 --> 02:04:11.321]  You notice, we've barely been covering Afghanistan.
[02:04:11.321 --> 02:04:13.022]  You notice that, right?
[02:04:13.022 --> 02:04:13.902]  Yep.
[02:04:13.902 --> 02:04:15.682]  We've got to pick our hill and we've got to do it, man.
[02:04:15.682 --> 02:04:19.703]  And if we're the only ones doing it right, then we just need to keep doing it right.
[02:04:19.703 --> 02:04:21.464]  Hey, tell me the Adam Meckler story real quick.
[02:04:23.035 --> 02:04:25.216]  My aunt is several states away.
[02:04:25.216 --> 02:04:28.378]  She finally got talked into getting the COVID jab.
[02:04:28.378 --> 02:04:30.799]  She was immediately sick with COVID.
[02:04:30.799 --> 02:04:34.621]  Was sick for four days, got tested positive for COVID.
[02:04:34.621 --> 02:04:38.002]  She wanted nothing to do with the hospital because she knew that they got her.
[02:04:38.002 --> 02:04:40.803]  She just knew she shouldn't have got the shot and that they got her.
[02:04:40.803 --> 02:04:43.905]  And I drove the two states away with horse pace.
[02:04:43.905 --> 02:04:45.586]  When I got there, her pulse ox was 90.
[02:04:45.586 --> 02:04:46.906]  It took her three days.
[02:04:46.906 --> 02:04:47.567]  She's 100% better.
[02:04:48.789 --> 02:04:49.529]  Good job!
[02:04:49.529 --> 02:04:52.271]  Now warn others and save others from these killers.
[02:04:52.271 --> 02:04:54.052]  Good job, Caleb!

[02:06:09.870 --> 02:06:14.953]  Alright, we've got a major whistleblower, Dr. Judy A. Mickiewicz.
[02:06:28.843 --> 02:06:43.234]  Spent 20 years at the National Cancer Institute, worked for Dr. Francis W. Brusetti, and one of the founding fathers of human retrovirology, and has co-authored more than 40 scientific papers.
[02:06:43.234 --> 02:06:44.736]  He's co-founded and directed the first
[02:06:45.947 --> 02:06:48.350]  And I'm not going to go over all of her bio.
[02:06:48.350 --> 02:06:51.753]  Institute using a systems biology approach, 2006.
[02:06:51.753 --> 02:06:56.218]  Dr. Mikovits lives in Southern California with her husband, David.
[02:06:56.218 --> 02:06:59.982]  Plaguethebook.com, her new book just came out.
[02:06:59.982 --> 02:07:03.866]  Ending Plague, a Scholar's Obligation in Age of Corruption.
[02:07:05.288 --> 02:07:09.011]  And she joins us to talk about what she's gone through.
[02:07:09.011 --> 02:07:11.252]  She was politically persecuted by Fauci.
[02:07:11.252 --> 02:07:13.974]  She blew the whistle on Fauci.
[02:07:13.974 --> 02:07:16.816]  And so she can start wherever she wants, you know, with.
[02:07:17.756 --> 02:07:17.936]  I think.
[02:07:40.680 --> 02:07:42.881]  World IDs are being announced.
[02:07:42.881 --> 02:07:51.583]  We have videos of police dogs tearing people's faces off in the UK for being outside and police running people over with cars and horses in Australia and Germany.
[02:07:51.583 --> 02:07:54.064]  I mean, this is just a worldwide tyranny.
[02:07:54.064 --> 02:07:58.205]  And I know you've been on the inside and blew the whistle about it.
[02:07:58.205 --> 02:08:02.086]  So please give us your first big picture take and then take us wherever you want to go.
[02:08:02.086 --> 02:08:02.726]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:08:04.182 --> 02:08:04.782]  Thanks, Alice.
[02:08:04.782 --> 02:08:27.692]  Well, the first big picture take is really that our book, Ending Plague, is Dr. Rossetti's, the first time he's talked in 40 years about Fauci, Gallo, and this plague of corruption that has really gripped our country for more than 40 years, killing innocent people, starting with HIV AIDS.
[02:08:28.212 --> 02:08:33.673]  And we see this scenario in the same game plan play out over and over again.
[02:08:33.673 --> 02:08:55.298]  I don't care whether it's Ebola in 2014, Zika in 2017, we all have known and we've known since my first interaction with Tony Fauci in 1984 when he then took Luc Montagnier's isolation and discovery of HIV and its association
[02:08:56.319 --> 02:09:08.928]  with AIDS, and he corrupted that to take away the testing so that the testing didn't get to the victims and the most susceptible communities for decades.
[02:09:08.928 --> 02:09:20.937]  And as you'll see in our latest book, in fact, the misogyny, I guess I'll call it, or the discrimination against women, children, denied treatment for
[02:09:22.338 --> 02:09:43.992]  Any of these diseases being marginalized called chronic fatigue syndrome, when in fact what we now know is that the animal contaminants that have contaminated the blood supply for more than 40 years and have contaminated vaccines.
[02:09:43.992 --> 02:09:50.116]  So the whole idea is you can't grow viruses, the antigens for viral vaccines,
[02:09:50.549 --> 02:09:50.649]  Yes.
[02:10:13.415 --> 02:10:15.356]  They're associated with cancer.
[02:10:15.356 --> 02:10:21.479]  The XMRVs that we discovered have a protein called syncytin.
[02:10:21.479 --> 02:10:32.023]  And syncytin is the envelope or part of the spike protein that has been engineered into SARS-CoV-2, into this vaccine.
[02:10:32.023 --> 02:10:35.044]  Again, SARS-CoV-2 never caused COVID.
[02:10:35.044 --> 02:10:37.005]  It was always injected
[02:10:37.005 --> 02:10:37.986]  We're good to go.
[02:10:56.719 --> 02:11:06.491]  If you got the flu vaccine in 2017 through 18, you were 36% more likely to be diagnosed with COVID.
[02:11:06.491 --> 02:11:10.256]  So these vaccines are not vaccines.
[02:11:10.256 --> 02:11:11.457]  They're chemotherapy.
[02:11:11.457 --> 02:11:13.480]  They're gene therapy.
[02:11:13.480 --> 02:11:14.982]  And in fact,
[02:11:16.022 --> 02:11:28.004]  The intention of Fauci and the top levels of the NIH, which is fully revealed in our book, Ending Plague, a scholar's obligation in an age of corruption.
[02:11:28.004 --> 02:11:43.827]  The intention is to murder the tens of millions of people worldwide who are infected with HIV, XMRVs from their contaminated vaccines, Borrelia, Babesia, you know, the chronic Lyme disease, the explosion
[02:11:44.267 --> 02:11:47.709]  of autoimmune disease, Parkinson's disease, ALS.
[02:11:47.709 --> 02:11:57.895]  This can all be attributed to the contaminants and not just the viruses but glyphosate as we know from our friend Dr. Stephanie Seneff.
[02:11:57.895 --> 02:12:05.739]  But the great news is there are solutions and ivermectin is potentially anti-cancer.
[02:12:06.599 --> 02:12:09.642]  And yes, they are causing the cancer.
[02:12:09.642 --> 02:12:16.788]  The MLVs or the XMRVs mean Murine Leukemia Causing Viruses.
[02:12:16.788 --> 02:12:19.030]  Murine Leukemia Viruses.
[02:12:19.030 --> 02:12:23.493]  Well, Doctor, walk us through this because there's literally thousands of AP Reuters.
[02:12:23.493 --> 02:12:27.036]  Even New York Times are like, hey, if you take the Moderna or Pfizer
[02:12:27.717 --> 02:12:32.620]  You're gonna think you have cancer in the lymph nodes and in your uterus, but it's no big deal.
[02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:35.121]  And in your breasts and other areas, it's no big deal.
[02:12:35.121 --> 02:12:38.182]  Doctors, if it looks like cancer, just don't treat it for six months.
[02:12:38.182 --> 02:12:40.864]  Well then, I mean, Roger Stone's wife got the Pfizer.
[02:12:40.864 --> 02:12:43.125]  Within a month, a huge tumor grew under her arm.
[02:12:43.125 --> 02:12:44.686]  Stage 4 lymphoma.
[02:12:44.686 --> 02:12:45.286]  Not Hodgkin's.
[02:12:45.786 --> 02:12:54.853]  And so you were warning us a year and a half ago, here it is and now I've talked to the oncology wards and they just say they're full of exploding cancers of the people that took it.
[02:12:54.853 --> 02:13:01.278]  So Fauci knew, this is super bold, explain what this so-called shot is doing and why.
[02:13:01.278 --> 02:13:09.964]  I've seen the my studies that UTE funded in 2012 where it caused not just blood clots but cancers and the scientist said don't use this as a human vaccine.
[02:13:09.964 --> 02:13:11.826]  He then runs out and gets it and uses it.
[02:13:11.826 --> 02:13:14.828]  I mean, I'm no top scientist that worked with him like you, but
[02:13:15.248 --> 02:13:18.669]  I mean, this is totally premeditated.
[02:13:18.669 --> 02:13:35.713]  Correct, because I led the lab of antiviral drug mechanisms in 1999 through 2001, and before going to direct to Epigenics Pharmaceuticals Cancer Biology Program, where we knew these mechanisms right then and there.
[02:13:36.113 --> 02:14:02.934]  You express the envelope, the spike protein, of a murine leukemia virus-related virus, XMRV, or our own gamma retrovirus known as HERV-W, human endogenous retrovirus W. You're injecting the envelope protein, the envelope protein alone, that our colleagues the Rossettis have known and their research back at the National Cancer Institute started, my days there, started June 10, 1980.
[02:14:05.195 --> 02:14:13.382]  So, for 20 years, we knew expression of syncytin, the envelope protein alone, caused cancer.
[02:14:13.382 --> 02:14:17.805]  That is in the spike protein of these vaccines.
[02:14:17.805 --> 02:14:26.452]  You are injecting the blueprint to drive cancer, and we know it, and we've seen it, and in fact,
[02:14:28.032 --> 02:14:39.094]  Unfortunately, my own daughter-in-law was killed and died two weeks ago from a cancer she was diagnosed with in April of 2020.
[02:14:39.094 --> 02:14:49.256]  And I can say you can't kill a healthy 40-year-old woman faster than the oncologist killed her here in LA.
[02:14:49.256 --> 02:14:52.777]  And they refused for months to give her
[02:14:53.617 --> 02:14:55.057]  Ivermectin.
[02:14:55.057 --> 02:15:04.680]  I sent them dozens of papers showing Ivermectin is anti-cancer, anti-metastasis.
[02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:09.141]  We understand the syncytia are fused cells.
[02:15:09.141 --> 02:15:10.361]  What is a tumor?
[02:15:10.361 --> 02:15:12.202]  Fused clumps of cells.
[02:15:12.202 --> 02:15:13.182]  What is a blood clot?
[02:15:13.442 --> 02:15:15.466]  Fuse red blood cells.
[02:15:15.466 --> 02:15:18.673]  Syncytin is Velcro.
[02:15:18.673 --> 02:15:21.579]  It causes fusion of cells.
[02:15:21.579 --> 02:15:23.984]  We've known that fact.
[02:15:24.694 --> 02:15:26.855]  For 40 years.
[02:15:26.855 --> 02:15:35.539]  Doctor, all I know is, I know a bunch of young people, like you said, 30, 40, 50, that's young, I'm almost 50, they take it and suddenly get cancer a month later.
[02:15:35.539 --> 02:15:40.361]  And then they say, oh, it can give you tumors, no big deal, don't worry about those tumors.
[02:15:40.361 --> 02:15:42.522]  I mean, this is insane.
[02:15:42.522 --> 02:15:45.303]  And in the rat studies, as you know, they got tumors as well.
[02:15:45.763 --> 02:15:48.264]  So, I'm going to ask you, Doctor, where this is all going.
[02:15:48.264 --> 02:15:50.604]  We'll talk about your book and so much more.
[02:15:50.604 --> 02:15:53.545]  Leading Scientist Whistleblower joins us live.
[02:15:53.545 --> 02:15:55.185]  Everything's You Predicted, now coming through.
[02:15:55.185 --> 02:15:57.605]  Hey, everybody.
[02:15:57.605 --> 02:16:03.106]  If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great news.
[02:16:03.106 --> 02:16:05.547]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[02:16:05.547 --> 02:16:06.387]  Here's the thing.
[02:16:06.387 --> 02:16:10.688]  We just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans.
[02:16:10.688 --> 02:16:11.648]  Survival soup beans.
[02:16:12.028 --> 02:16:20.233]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever, the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[02:16:20.233 --> 02:16:21.334]  The best part?
[02:16:21.334 --> 02:16:30.360]  We've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food prices are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.
[02:16:30.620 --> 02:16:31.641]  Gets even better.
[02:16:31.641 --> 02:16:42.407]  With your permission, and with a high regard for your health and well-being, I also want to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the world.

[02:17:05.707 --> 02:17:08.288]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[02:17:08.288 --> 02:17:09.789]  They know you're angry.
[02:17:09.789 --> 02:17:14.591]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[02:17:57.495 --> 02:18:02.358]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[02:18:02.358 --> 02:18:04.419]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[02:18:04.419 --> 02:18:09.883]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[02:18:09.883 --> 02:18:10.984]  But we failed.
[02:18:10.984 --> 02:18:12.625]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[02:18:12.625 --> 02:18:14.506]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed.
[02:18:14.506 --> 02:18:16.207]  But they are going ahead
[02:18:16.567 --> 02:18:20.509]  With their full operational de-industrialization, Great Reset.
[02:18:20.509 --> 02:18:29.433]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[02:18:29.433 --> 02:18:34.616]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[02:18:34.616 --> 02:18:37.537]  And one of the number one things to do is high-quality, storable food.
[02:18:37.537 --> 02:18:42.299]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at info-war-store.com.
[02:18:42.299 --> 02:18:45.801]  So whether it's a month or a six-month or a year supply or specialty diets,
[02:18:46.101 --> 02:18:47.865]  It's ready to ship right now.
[02:18:47.865 --> 02:18:52.775]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[02:18:52.775 --> 02:18:55.120]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[02:18:55.120 --> 02:18:56.723]  Get ready at infowarestore.com.
[02:18:57.506 --> 02:19:01.509]  People can't really spend money anywhere better than MyPillow.com with promo code ALEX.
[02:19:01.509 --> 02:19:05.491]  Right now, what I've done is passed all the savings to the customer.
[02:19:05.491 --> 02:19:10.314]  Like sheets, our Giza sheets, they're normally, you get 50% off with code ALEX.
[02:19:10.314 --> 02:19:13.776]  They're as low as $49.99, depending on the size.
[02:19:13.776 --> 02:19:17.179]  We've got pillows, MyPillows, my original MyPillow premiums are normally $69.99, $29.99.
[02:19:19.500 --> 02:19:24.922]  The best thing, I think, all you guys, everyone out there, you can get my book for $9.99.
[02:19:24.922 --> 02:19:27.583]  My book will help anybody out there in addiction.
[02:19:27.583 --> 02:19:29.263]  And that's free shipping with the book.
[02:19:29.263 --> 02:19:33.165]  Right now, all of the specials, I used to run one here and one there.
[02:19:33.165 --> 02:19:34.345]  I put them all on there.
[02:19:34.345 --> 02:19:35.986]  The lowest prices you've ever seen.
[02:19:35.986 --> 02:19:37.386]  And we have our new bed.
[02:19:37.386 --> 02:19:39.787]  Everybody, I don't know if you've seen our bed infomercial.
[02:19:39.787 --> 02:19:41.728]  I developed this bed over a year and a half.
[02:19:41.728 --> 02:19:43.568]  Best mattress you'll ever sleep on.
[02:19:43.568 --> 02:19:45.589]  It's a combination of coils and pads.
[02:19:45.669 --> 02:19:46.910]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:10.996 --> 02:20:12.697]  Big Brother.
[02:20:12.697 --> 02:20:15.017]  Mainstream media.
[02:20:15.017 --> 02:20:16.798]  Government cover-ups.
[02:20:16.798 --> 02:20:18.878]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:20:18.878 --> 02:20:21.019]  Well, so does he.
[02:20:21.019 --> 02:20:26.541]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:26.541 --> 02:20:30.442]  You know, I've talked to so many medical doctors that are on-air, also off-air.
[02:20:30.442 --> 02:20:36.104]  The thing that really woke them up was the suppression of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.
[02:20:37.415 --> 02:20:41.116]  Because they can go read all the hundreds of mainline studies and the Japanese studies and the U.S.
[02:20:41.116 --> 02:20:46.839]  studies and the British studies and know that it's so, you know, good at stopping what's happening.
[02:20:46.839 --> 02:20:48.980]  And then to see the suppression of it.
[02:20:48.980 --> 02:20:52.101]  So we have a major whistleblower, Dr. Judy A. Mikovits.
[02:20:52.101 --> 02:20:55.662]  She is the lady that first, over a year and a half ago, began exposing things.
[02:20:55.662 --> 02:20:57.163]  She went up against Fauci.
[02:20:57.163 --> 02:20:59.043]  He literally came after her.
[02:20:59.043 --> 02:21:02.665]  She can go into the history if she wants or what's currently happening or what's going on.
[02:21:02.665 --> 02:21:04.906]  But they've also got the new book, Ending Plague.
[02:21:05.766 --> 02:21:08.307]  A scholar's obligation in an age of corruption.
[02:21:08.307 --> 02:21:09.927]  Everybody should get it right now.
[02:21:09.927 --> 02:21:11.027]  Pleggedthebook.com.
[02:21:11.027 --> 02:21:12.908]  But this is a shorter segment.
[02:21:12.908 --> 02:21:13.828]  Long segment's coming up.
[02:21:13.828 --> 02:21:15.128]  Then another segment.
[02:21:15.128 --> 02:21:17.228]  Every amount of time is so precious.
[02:21:17.228 --> 02:21:25.910]  For those that don't know from the studies, because you're not just a doctor, you're a research scientist and virologist, why does ivermectin work so good?
[02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:27.151]  Explain that in layman's terms.
[02:21:27.151 --> 02:21:33.372]  I can show Japanese national press conferences and I can show Oxford studies, but why does it work so good?
[02:21:36.078 --> 02:21:41.600]  Layman's Terms is difficult, but it works so well because it works on your immune system.
[02:21:41.600 --> 02:21:44.520]  It's not directly an anti-parasite.
[02:21:44.520 --> 02:21:47.281]  It doesn't just kill bugs in a test tube.
[02:21:47.281 --> 02:21:54.563]  It tells your immune system how to restore balance, your functional adaptive T-cell immune response.
[02:21:54.563 --> 02:21:56.043]  So when we inject
[02:21:56.363 --> 02:22:15.057]  When you inject a pathogen directly into the blood, you bypass your type 1, your innate immune responses, type 1 interferons, glutathione, things that normally just gobble up RNA viruses, just like a Pac-Man gobbles up RNA viruses.
[02:22:15.057 --> 02:22:22.843]  When you inject it, you're shifting to what we call a TH2, a functional TH2 response, and the cytokines are very different.
[02:22:22.843 --> 02:22:26.146]  So they shift away to where they're looking for parasites.
[02:22:26.486 --> 02:22:30.990]  They're looking for worms, helminths, cytokines, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10.
[02:22:30.990 --> 02:22:40.117]  I know that's not ordinary speak, but by now, physicians, people everywhere know what a functional adaptive type 2 T cell response is.
[02:22:40.117 --> 02:22:45.321]  So, ivermectin allows you to shift back and say, no, no, we've got this under control.
[02:22:45.321 --> 02:22:50.785]  We've silenced any activated fungal infections, microbial infections.
[02:22:50.785 --> 02:22:54.868]  And we're going to go back and direct all our immune tissue and all our immune response
[02:22:55.268 --> 02:22:55.589]  Thank you.
[02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:23.236]  And my whole career is how do viruses cause cancer by dysregulating the natural, the innate and adaptive immune response.
[02:23:23.236 --> 02:23:34.683]  That was my PhD thesis that ultimately changed the paradigm for treating HIV AIDS because they were targeting the T cell, they were targeting the functional type 2 responses.
[02:23:34.943 --> 02:23:39.867]  And now let me throw this at you, because I've seen the medical studies, I've aired a bunch of clubs of doctors, but I'm ignorant.
[02:23:39.867 --> 02:23:41.328]  I'm not a scientist like you.
[02:23:41.328 --> 02:23:49.135]  Why are they saying the Pfizer and Moderna shots, even their own people brag, are turning off just one shot, one third of the killer T's?
[02:23:49.135 --> 02:23:49.876]  What's going on there?
[02:23:51.567 --> 02:24:03.133]  Well, I can't tell you from a standpoint of data, and that's all I speak to, because nobody's been privy to independent data and analysis of the T cell responses.
[02:24:03.133 --> 02:24:07.535]  We do know that this is why we use ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.
[02:24:07.535 --> 02:24:15.439]  They're subtly different as far as their mechanism of action, but they restore the appropriate functional T cell responses.
[02:24:16.019 --> 02:24:26.846]  And I'll be giving a lecture on all of this on Thursday, September 2nd, live in Thousand Oaks at Godspeak Church, where we'll be doing Autism One.
[02:24:26.846 --> 02:24:39.453]  Because Autism One, the conference, has been ahead of the curve the entire time, showing how to treat these neuroimmune diseases and cancer, and they're the same pathways.
[02:24:39.753 --> 02:24:52.845]  This is why supplements like you just showed, like your fabulous turmeric supplement, like quercetin, like the foods, the minerals, we're so depleted in minerals by the toxins in our soil.
[02:24:52.845 --> 02:25:02.354]  So natural products, this is the big victory, why your show is so important, why the info wars and the supplement wars is we've won.
[02:25:02.354 --> 02:25:04.777]  We don't care what Tony Fauci does anymore.
[02:25:05.237 --> 02:25:12.920]  I was about to say, you're saying the answer, that's why they're so desperate in trying to block natural treatments is, the answer is just information, people discovering what's happening.
[02:25:12.920 --> 02:25:24.585]  But let me just ask you this, you knew Fauci, you blew the whistle, he came after you, they've had international TV shows, they tried to discredit you, I looked up what you said about him, he definitely did horrible stuff with HIV, suppressed treatments like you said.
[02:25:25.765 --> 02:25:30.708]  Who's behind him and why is this little monster so politically bulletproof?
[02:25:30.708 --> 02:25:37.852]  And obviously Big Pharma is launching this to try to take over society, to bring in a global cashless system, global IDs, world government.
[02:25:37.852 --> 02:25:40.974]  I mean, they admit this is their vehicle to total power.
[02:25:40.974 --> 02:25:43.656]  I just can't believe they've gotten so many people in government on board.
[02:25:45.157 --> 02:25:46.779]  Well, they've been on board forever.
[02:25:46.779 --> 02:25:48.580]  Who's behind him?
[02:25:48.580 --> 02:26:01.413]  Robert Redfield, Deborah Birx, who destroyed the lives of our military testing their HIV vaccine back in the 90s, got away with those crimes, fabricating the literature.
[02:26:01.413 --> 02:26:09.601]  You know, everything about HIV AIDS for the first 12 years was Bob Gallo and Tony Fauci led.
[02:26:10.001 --> 02:26:25.276]  You know, Bob Gallo was the one who created all of this, and the two of them teamed up, and that's what you'll read, and then convinced then-President Ronald Reagan, you know, this who-got-credit-for-HIV.
[02:26:25.276 --> 02:26:26.297]  Who got credit?
[02:26:26.297 --> 02:26:30.901]  Who got fame, fortune, and money for the diagnostic testing?
[02:26:30.901 --> 02:26:34.425]  You know, that was the fight between France and the United States.
[02:26:34.745 --> 02:26:50.474]  He poisoned patients with AZT, as you're showing now, using it at the wrong dose, refusing type 1 interferons, refusing peptide T, natural products, all the subject of the movies the band played on in the Dallas Fires Club.
[02:26:50.474 --> 02:26:52.335]  This was my entire life.
[02:26:52.655 --> 02:26:54.818]  And I didn't just come out a year ago.
[02:26:54.818 --> 02:27:12.457]  This is the third book in a series that started when we realized the gamma retroviruses, the third family of human retrovirus diseases that were caused by the gain of function studies, which continue and have always been going on.
[02:27:13.258 --> 02:27:15.700]  I did those studies at Fort Detrick.
[02:27:15.700 --> 02:27:17.021]  This is really bio warfare.
[02:27:28.772 --> 02:27:38.537]  On a scale of 1 to 10, it seems as a layman that this new global rollout is a much more deadly shot, that the level of death and disease and cancer just has escalated.
[02:27:38.537 --> 02:27:46.741]  I mean, I'm familiar with the experimental anthrax shots, experimental HIV, the carnage there, everything you expose, but am I right saying that it's just exponentially worse?
[02:27:47.981 --> 02:27:48.521]  Absolutely.
[02:27:48.521 --> 02:27:51.984]  This is the three deadliest pandemics of our time.
[02:27:51.984 --> 02:27:56.687]  HIV, XMRV and SARS all rolled into one shot.
[02:27:56.687 --> 02:28:12.957]  All you need is the spike protein and it's that synthetic spike protein that is this deadly epidemics that affect 13 million Americans that Fauci and WHO, every level of our government has covered up since AIDS in the 80s and the true causes.
[02:28:13.297 --> 02:28:14.358]  And the true solution.
[02:28:14.358 --> 02:28:17.160]  So is this not the greatest crime ever committed against humanity?
[02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:23.984]  Billions injected, which they admit has the HIV, spike protein, everything, injected with this Franken-creature?
[02:28:23.984 --> 02:28:24.685]  Correct.
[02:28:24.685 --> 02:28:26.506]  But the answer is simple.
[02:28:26.506 --> 02:28:28.287]  Not another shot ever.
[02:28:28.287 --> 02:28:31.629]  And we can cure it with everything you're talking about today.
[02:28:31.629 --> 02:28:32.750]  And I am as well.
[02:28:32.750 --> 02:28:34.371]  It's all in- Well, stay there.
[02:28:34.371 --> 02:28:37.913]  Then I want to ask you, doctor, why do they want these boosters every five to six months?
[02:28:37.913 --> 02:28:39.154]  I mean, wow!
[02:28:39.154 --> 02:28:41.556]  We're going to come right back with Dr. Judy A. Mikovits.
[02:28:42.759 --> 02:28:44.362]  PlaggTheBook.com.
[02:28:44.362 --> 02:28:45.484]  PlaggTheBook.com.
[02:28:45.484 --> 02:28:46.346]  Get the book.
[02:28:46.346 --> 02:28:47.368]  She is a fighter.
[02:28:47.368 --> 02:28:48.450]  She has been persecuted.
[02:28:48.450 --> 02:28:49.612]  She has been attacked.
[02:28:49.612 --> 02:28:51.957]  She has been literally a political prisoner.
[02:28:51.957 --> 02:28:53.339]  And she is vindicated.
[02:28:53.339 --> 02:28:53.860]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:56.550 --> 02:29:04.977]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[02:29:04.977 --> 02:29:05.998]  Here's why.
[02:29:05.998 --> 02:29:09.922]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[02:29:09.922 --> 02:29:15.046]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[02:29:15.046 --> 02:29:23.454]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[02:29:24.014 --> 02:29:32.007]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:29:32.728 --> 02:29:38.813]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses, too.
[02:29:38.813 --> 02:29:42.637]  Go to MySolarBackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[02:29:42.637 --> 02:29:44.658]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:29:44.658 --> 02:29:53.066]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[02:29:53.066 --> 02:29:55.428]  Yours free at MySolarBackup.com.
[02:29:57.478 --> 02:30:02.340]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[02:30:02.340 --> 02:30:04.381]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[02:30:04.381 --> 02:30:09.864]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[02:30:09.864 --> 02:30:10.964]  But we failed.
[02:30:10.964 --> 02:30:12.625]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[02:30:12.625 --> 02:30:14.486]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed.
[02:30:14.486 --> 02:30:16.207]  But they are going ahead
[02:30:16.567 --> 02:30:20.510]  With their full operational deindustrialization, Great Reset.
[02:30:20.510 --> 02:30:29.436]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[02:30:29.436 --> 02:30:34.959]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[02:30:34.959 --> 02:30:37.521]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storable food.
[02:30:37.521 --> 02:30:40.343]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices.
[02:30:40.603 --> 02:30:42.645]  Humanity is the main stakeholder on this planet.
[02:31:01.621 --> 02:31:02.202]  We're good to go.
[02:31:17.237 --> 02:31:25.704]  He brags on there about how they're capturing democracy and taking over governments worldwide to set up a corporate dictatorship under the UN.
[02:31:25.704 --> 02:31:27.986]  They admit all of this.
[02:31:27.986 --> 02:31:29.267]  They plan the lockdowns.
[02:31:29.267 --> 02:31:30.948]  They release the viruses.
[02:31:30.948 --> 02:31:32.670]  They think you're stupid.
[02:31:32.670 --> 02:31:38.775]  And their plan is to slowly cut off the resources so they can dictate total social control over you and your lives.
[02:31:39.355 --> 02:31:49.928]  That's how I was able to predict everything they did decades before they executed it, word for word, with total precision, because they have a detailed battle plan.
[02:31:49.928 --> 02:31:51.590]  We cover it live weekdays, 11 a.m.
[02:31:51.590 --> 02:31:52.491]  to 3 p.m.
[02:31:52.491 --> 02:31:54.593]  at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:31:54.593 --> 02:31:56.696]  Tell everybody to tune in now and warn the world.
[02:31:57.512 --> 02:32:03.793]  It's always critical, it's always vital, it's always essential to have enough high quality vitamins and minerals in your body.
[02:32:03.793 --> 02:32:06.694]  That's why essential vitamins and minerals are called essential.
[02:32:06.694 --> 02:32:07.814]  You must have them.
[02:32:07.814 --> 02:32:13.796]  But in today's crazy times, it is more important than ever to stay on top of it.
[02:32:13.796 --> 02:32:16.716]  And the Vitamin Mineral Fusion has been sold out for months and months and months.
[02:32:16.716 --> 02:32:18.977]  It's got all the essential vitamins and minerals and amino acids.
[02:32:19.557 --> 02:32:19.957]  It is.
[02:32:19.957 --> 02:32:22.918]  33% off while supplies last.
[02:32:22.918 --> 02:32:24.179]  X2's been sold out for a while.
[02:32:24.179 --> 02:32:25.499]  It's now back in stock.
[02:32:25.499 --> 02:32:27.260]  It's discounted while supplies last.
[02:32:27.260 --> 02:32:29.080]  We have this great concentrated turmeric formula.
[02:32:29.080 --> 02:32:29.981]  It's amazing.
[02:32:29.981 --> 02:32:31.041]  It's back in stock.
[02:32:31.041 --> 02:32:32.061]  They're all discounted.
[02:32:32.061 --> 02:32:33.982]  33 to 50% off while supplies last.
[02:32:36.423 --> 02:32:37.824]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:13.063 --> 02:33:14.764]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:33:14.764 --> 02:33:15.445]  to 3 p.m.
[02:33:15.445 --> 02:33:16.726]  Central, I'm here live.
[02:33:16.726 --> 02:33:19.408]  The Law Room's coming up at 3 p.m.
[02:33:19.408 --> 02:33:21.190]  today with Owen Schroer.
[02:33:21.190 --> 02:33:23.632]  We've got a big guest host in the fourth hour.
[02:33:23.632 --> 02:33:25.653]  Dr. Judy A. Mickiewicz is our guest.
[02:33:25.653 --> 02:33:34.821]  She worked in cancer research, vaccine research, Fort Detrick, Maryland, NIH, CDC, highest levels, with Fauci, blew the whistle, plagued the book.
[02:33:34.821 --> 02:33:35.901]  Dot com is the new book.
[02:33:35.901 --> 02:33:40.265]  It's life and death to get the book and to read it and then share it with others.
[02:33:40.265 --> 02:33:42.186]  And Plandemic came out over a year ago.
[02:33:43.243 --> 02:33:48.426]  I mean, like, 15, 16 months ago and totally predicted what would then unfold.
[02:33:48.426 --> 02:33:50.727]  And then, of course, she got demonized and attacked.
[02:33:50.727 --> 02:33:57.111]  But now we're seeing a replay of everything that Fauci and these criminal groups of eugenicists have done before, but on a wider scale.
[02:33:57.111 --> 02:33:58.511]  So you were caught off by the break.
[02:33:58.511 --> 02:34:00.132]  You were saying, I worked in Fort Detrick.
[02:34:00.132 --> 02:34:01.013]  I know about cancer.
[02:34:01.753 --> 02:34:03.754]  I know what this is going to do.
[02:34:03.754 --> 02:34:09.335]  And if you're a radio listener, we're just putting mainstream news articles up about, oh, you get the shot, you get cancer, but it's no big deal.
[02:34:09.335 --> 02:34:10.575]  At least COVID doesn't get you.
[02:34:10.575 --> 02:34:16.657]  And then so many people that I know in the hospital have taken the shot and they say they have COVID and they're trying to suppress those numbers.
[02:34:16.657 --> 02:34:19.898]  You got the floor for the next 25 minutes till this hour is over.
[02:34:19.898 --> 02:34:22.459]  Please continue.
[02:34:22.459 --> 02:34:30.801]  Yeah, so what I'm saying is they've used the same playbook and the same game plan for the last, in my experience now,
[02:34:31.634 --> 02:34:33.195]  The last 40 years.
[02:34:33.195 --> 02:34:39.317]  So, and I first learned of the depths of the plague of corruption in 2011.
[02:34:39.317 --> 02:34:41.698]  And that's the subject of our first book play.
[02:34:41.698 --> 02:34:52.243]  And we were actually going to talk to you, Alex, in October of 2019, when our book, Plague of Corruption, was supposed to come out, was supposed to publish.
[02:34:52.643 --> 02:34:56.125]  And the publication of that was delayed.
[02:34:56.125 --> 02:34:58.006]  I'm not sure why.
[02:34:58.006 --> 02:35:02.508]  But God, as I used to say, or like to say, God has a sense of humor.
[02:35:02.508 --> 02:35:05.449]  So it didn't publish until April 14th of 2020.
[02:35:05.449 --> 02:35:08.751]  And it reads like prophecy.
[02:35:09.211 --> 02:35:15.934]  And Mickey Willis' film, Plandemic, was actually a promotional video for that book.
[02:35:15.934 --> 02:35:18.415]  It was supposed to be a short promotional video.
[02:35:18.415 --> 02:35:21.416]  As he said in the talk, he met me a few years earlier.
[02:35:21.416 --> 02:35:26.919]  We were taught, my friend, we go into all of this in our book, Ending Plague, and show how
[02:35:27.774 --> 02:35:29.755]  Really, this is the big thing.
[02:35:29.755 --> 02:35:41.500]  The censorship of news, the censorship of information, the censorship of the fact that there are simple, safe solutions to this.
[02:35:41.500 --> 02:35:45.242]  And they've played this exact same playbook.
[02:35:45.242 --> 02:35:48.523]  So I disagree with you on subtle points.
[02:35:48.523 --> 02:35:49.624]  These folks are stupid.
[02:35:50.684 --> 02:35:59.446]  They play the same playbook over and over and over again as if we're all just going to sit there and take it and watch our families die.
[02:35:59.446 --> 02:36:02.706]  As if there are no scientists with integrity.
[02:36:02.706 --> 02:36:04.707]  That's what ending plague is about.
[02:36:04.707 --> 02:36:08.287]  What is a scholar's obligation in an age of corruption?
[02:36:08.287 --> 02:36:16.389]  Not only to produce the knowledge to end human suffering, which a PhD must do, understand why something's not working.
[02:36:16.389 --> 02:36:17.169]  There's a reason.
[02:36:17.529 --> 02:36:17.889]  I think so.
[02:36:38.402 --> 02:36:43.666]  2005, Tony Fauci eroded himself again in 2015.
[02:36:43.666 --> 02:37:04.919]  Hydroxychloroquine stopped the deadly Ebola outbreak that Tony Fauci released from Fort Detrick in the summer of 2014, as you were saying at the opening of this show during the Obama administration, to cover up the fact that, of the movie Vaxxed, of the confection,
[02:37:05.359 --> 02:37:29.015]  of the CDC employee, William Thompson, who confessed that they'd cover up that MMR given to little black, Hispanic and Native American boys, boys of color, before the year they were three years old, literally giving MMR, three RNA viruses in a single vaccine, giving that shot before
[02:37:29.838 --> 02:37:33.399]  The little black boys were three years old.
[02:37:33.399 --> 02:37:44.704]  They had two to four times the risk of getting autism, neurodevelopment disease, cancer in their parents, in the military, hormone-driven cancers.
[02:37:44.704 --> 02:37:47.605]  We understood the mechanisms.
[02:37:47.605 --> 02:37:49.826]  We knew the biomarkers.
[02:37:49.826 --> 02:37:52.186]  They've covered them up forever.
[02:37:52.186 --> 02:37:54.907]  And so the Ebola that was released murdering 21,000
[02:37:56.608 --> 02:38:03.012]  Innocent people in Sierra Leone, people of color, was released from Fort Detrick.
[02:38:03.012 --> 02:38:06.514]  It was similar to, and they're not released into the air.
[02:38:06.514 --> 02:38:09.376]  They're shipped in little vials in cell lines.
[02:38:09.376 --> 02:38:11.177]  They're called vaccines.
[02:38:11.177 --> 02:38:13.598]  They're fermented in large fermenters.
[02:38:13.598 --> 02:38:19.222]  This is what we describe the nitty gritty details, how the sausage is made.
[02:38:19.662 --> 02:38:21.644]  You know, that's what I do.
[02:38:21.644 --> 02:38:23.086]  I make drugs.
[02:38:23.086 --> 02:38:25.989]  I make natural products into therapies.
[02:38:25.989 --> 02:38:35.739]  And yet the industry, the oncology industry, pushes these deadly drugs just as every other part of the medical community.
[02:38:35.799 --> 02:38:43.829]  Let me just back you up, because the Rockefellers by the 20s, I read this in Mainline History books, isolated that most cancer was being delivered by natural viruses.
[02:38:43.829 --> 02:38:46.151]  So they got obsessed with that, learned how to capture it.
[02:38:46.151 --> 02:38:53.540]  Even the movie JFK shows that down in New Orleans the CIA was developing a whole lab how to give people cancer via vaccines.
[02:38:53.540 --> 02:38:54.742]  You know, like they did with Jack Ruby.
[02:38:55.482 --> 02:38:56.903]  And so this goes on and on.
[02:38:56.903 --> 02:38:58.684]  This is something they're obsessed with.
[02:38:58.684 --> 02:39:09.109]  And then, for those that don't know, in the 1960s even, scientists would get on an airplane, and I've read this in mainline books, and fly across the country to see a child with cancer.
[02:39:09.109 --> 02:39:13.711]  Now, I go to the mall, a third of the kids look like they're dying of cancer, and I ask the parents how they got cancer.
[02:39:13.711 --> 02:39:18.353]  So how did we go from none of our children having cancer to it being everywhere?
[02:39:18.353 --> 02:39:19.694]  Well, it's viral, is that correct?
[02:39:21.099 --> 02:39:27.701]  Well, it's viral and microbial and we've injected these viruses because all liability was removed.
[02:39:27.701 --> 02:39:30.922]  We've injected them in every single vaccine.
[02:39:30.922 --> 02:39:32.122]  MMR.
[02:39:32.122 --> 02:39:34.043]  We're injecting RNA viruses.
[02:39:34.043 --> 02:39:38.864]  We're injecting, I can send you or provide for your listeners, this slide shows
[02:39:39.484 --> 02:39:48.513]  That show you that show you these these viruses deadly HIV Relative simian immune deficiency virus SV 40.
[02:39:48.513 --> 02:40:03.327]  This is what Bobby Kennedy's Brilliant forward in our book a plague of corruption discussed the 40 years the knowledge that we've injected this is infection and disease by injection the cancer has exploded and
[02:40:03.935 --> 02:40:10.940]  As the schedule of the CDC has increased because no liability is there at all.
[02:40:10.940 --> 02:40:12.961]  No liability, no testing.
[02:40:12.961 --> 02:40:17.064]  The Informed Consent Action Network and Dell Bigtree showed at the end of 2019.
[02:40:17.064 --> 02:40:18.084]  All of these dates are critical.
[02:40:20.746 --> 02:40:22.526]  The end of 2019.
[02:40:22.526 --> 02:40:23.667]  They got caught.
[02:40:23.667 --> 02:40:25.187]  They got caught by the movies.
[02:40:25.187 --> 02:40:27.247]  They got caught by Children's Health Defense.
[02:40:27.247 --> 02:40:30.328]  They got caught by many other heroes like Brian Hooker.
[02:40:30.328 --> 02:40:30.528]  I agree.
[02:40:30.528 --> 02:40:41.630]  They were desperate and in 2019 they had that emergency UN meeting on vaccines with the head of WHO in Switzerland and she says, we've got a wobbly first line.
[02:40:41.630 --> 02:40:42.770]  Everybody's waking up.
[02:40:42.770 --> 02:40:44.790]  We've got to suspend the vaccines.
[02:40:44.790 --> 02:40:47.771]  And all our experts agreed and so they doubled down now with this.
[02:40:48.715 --> 02:40:49.176]  Correct.
[02:40:49.176 --> 02:40:51.178]  And they created, they fabricated it.
[02:40:51.178 --> 02:40:56.485]  Just like they fabricated, so they had no solution because they didn't have their deadly virus.
[02:40:56.485 --> 02:41:02.232]  The Ebola outbreak was stopped by a smart doctor using hydroxychloroquine in 2014.
[02:41:02.232 --> 02:41:03.353]  So it doesn't matter the variant.
[02:41:06.296 --> 02:41:16.221]  Ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, quercetin, zinc, tumeric, minerals, amino acids, glutathione, vitamin C, vitamin D, the solutions are all there.
[02:41:16.221 --> 02:41:21.724]  So America, the world, needs to wake up and literally just put these criminals in jail.
[02:41:21.724 --> 02:41:23.945]  But before that, no more.
[02:41:23.945 --> 02:41:25.866]  Not another shot.
[02:41:25.866 --> 02:41:27.047]  It's my body.
[02:41:27.047 --> 02:41:29.428]  You will not inject anything.
[02:41:29.428 --> 02:41:31.429]  I'm a lab worker, 20 years.
[02:41:31.429 --> 02:41:32.890]  I got infected.
[02:41:32.890 --> 02:41:34.771]  It's called nosocomial spread.
[02:41:35.311 --> 02:41:47.798]  In 2010, I seroconverted to the deadly lung cancer-causing XMRB family, neuroimmune disease-causing lymphoma leukemia.
[02:41:47.798 --> 02:41:53.020]  I seroconverted, have high levels of protein in my blood at that time in 2010.
[02:41:53.020 --> 02:41:54.841]  Have the data.
[02:41:54.841 --> 02:41:55.822]  It's in our papers.
[02:41:55.822 --> 02:41:56.962]  It's in our talks.
[02:41:56.962 --> 02:41:57.903]  I'm not sick, am I?
[02:41:58.403 --> 02:42:00.524]  I'm just fine, but never again.
[02:42:00.524 --> 02:42:02.384]  I never got a shot.
[02:42:02.384 --> 02:42:10.146]  We got a choice of getting a hepatitis B vaccine when I worked with patients with HIV directly.
[02:42:10.146 --> 02:42:11.707]  You never wear a mask.
[02:42:11.707 --> 02:42:16.608]  It's called Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 Alpha.
[02:42:16.608 --> 02:42:18.609]  It's a blowtorch on cancer.
[02:42:18.609 --> 02:42:23.170]  So if everybody wants to end the plague of corruption once and for all,
[02:42:23.850 --> 02:42:26.433]  Stop listening to Satan.
[02:42:26.433 --> 02:42:37.404]  Restore your faith in the promise of science by trusting your God-given human immune endocannabinoid purinergic metabolism system.
[02:42:37.404 --> 02:42:37.984]  Go back.
[02:42:37.984 --> 02:42:39.486]  No more GMOs.
[02:42:39.486 --> 02:42:41.988]  No more toxic food, as you're showing.
[02:42:41.988 --> 02:42:42.809]  No more.
[02:42:42.809 --> 02:42:43.990]  Don't play their game.
[02:42:43.990 --> 02:42:45.852]  Don't go near your doctor.
[02:42:46.272 --> 02:42:49.733]  That's right, they're eugenicists that say they want to kill us, and Bill Gates runs it all.
[02:42:49.733 --> 02:42:50.993]  Doctors stay there.
[02:42:50.993 --> 02:42:54.214]  Dr. Judy Mikovits, I'm just blown away by this lady.
[02:42:54.214 --> 02:42:55.495]  We've been around to get her on for years.
[02:42:55.495 --> 02:42:56.395]  Here she is.
[02:42:56.395 --> 02:43:00.376]  People can't really spend money anywhere better than MyPillow.com with promo code ALEX.
[02:43:00.376 --> 02:43:04.358]  Right now, what I've done is passed all the savings to the customer.

[02:43:09.179 --> 02:43:10.519]  They're as low as $49.99, depending on the size.
[02:43:12.620 --> 02:43:17.147]  We've got pillows, my pillows, my original, my pillow premiums are normally $69.99, $29.99.
[02:43:17.147 --> 02:43:23.797]  The best thing, I think, all you guys, everyone out there, you can get my book for $9.99.
[02:43:23.797 --> 02:43:27.963]  My book will help anybody out there in addiction, and that's free shipping with the book.
[02:43:28.123 --> 02:43:32.024]  Right now, all of the specials, I used to run one here and one there.
[02:43:32.024 --> 02:43:33.184]  I put them all on there.
[02:43:33.184 --> 02:43:34.865]  The lowest prices you've ever seen.
[02:43:34.865 --> 02:43:36.225]  And we have our new bed.
[02:43:36.225 --> 02:43:38.646]  Everybody, I don't know if you've seen our bed infomercial.
[02:43:38.646 --> 02:43:40.567]  I developed this bed over a year and a half.
[02:43:40.567 --> 02:43:42.407]  Best mattress you'll ever sleep on.
[02:43:42.407 --> 02:43:45.048]  It's a combination of coils and patented foam.
[02:43:45.048 --> 02:43:46.328]  And this, they're amazing.
[02:43:46.328 --> 02:43:47.228]  There's nothing better.
[02:43:47.228 --> 02:43:51.110]  And they're not just amazing, the cost is not high and you support freedom.
[02:43:51.110 --> 02:43:52.950]  MyPillow.com, promo code Alex.
[02:43:52.950 --> 02:43:56.211]  You've got so many great products and we're just really proud of the work you're doing, Mike.
[02:43:56.491 --> 02:44:12.744]  In late August, InfoWars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[02:44:12.744 --> 02:44:16.406]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[02:44:16.406 --> 02:44:23.112]  It's a checkbox that everybody needs to have taken care of, right along with water filtration, self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[02:44:23.712 --> 02:44:27.796]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in now.
[02:44:27.796 --> 02:44:30.538]  We're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[02:44:30.538 --> 02:44:31.359]  It's high quality.
[02:44:31.359 --> 02:44:34.562]  It's very, very low cost at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:44:34.562 --> 02:44:41.948]  Because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[02:44:41.948 --> 02:44:45.932]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the InfoWare.
[02:44:47.012 --> 02:45:09.597]  So, when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight, I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe, I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[02:45:09.597 --> 02:45:12.778]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1, and it worked
[02:45:13.558 --> 02:45:14.118]  Pretty good.
[02:45:14.118 --> 02:45:16.180]  And then, shortly thereafter, you came out with F2.
[02:45:16.180 --> 02:45:20.163]  You had, you know, with the Deep Bird Source, you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[02:45:20.163 --> 02:45:26.488]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to, like, literally, like, my brain was enlightened.
[02:45:26.488 --> 02:45:27.930]  You know, I could think again.
[02:45:27.930 --> 02:45:29.771]  I could connect with people again.
[02:45:29.771 --> 02:45:36.156]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back, and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[02:45:36.156 --> 02:45:38.538]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[02:45:38.538 --> 02:45:40.420]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[02:45:40.420 --> 02:45:42.661]  It literally, like, if you want to sleep, just take it.
[02:45:42.661 --> 02:45:43.222]  It's amazing.
[02:45:43.362 --> 02:45:43.883]  It works.
[02:45:43.883 --> 02:45:46.426]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean.
[02:45:46.426 --> 02:45:52.633]  We have to break free of the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[02:45:52.633 --> 02:45:53.714]  Beautifully said, brother.
[02:45:53.714 --> 02:45:55.896]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.

[02:46:50.992 --> 02:46:52.513]  She's doing a big presentation on the second
[02:47:20.478 --> 02:47:31.343]  Southern California, but she's going to join us for an hour commercial-free podcast that goes so viral, pun intended, with us sometime in the week of the 6th.
[02:47:31.343 --> 02:47:33.324]  Dr. Judy A. Mickiewicz is our guest.
[02:47:33.324 --> 02:47:34.884]  Pleggedthebook.com.
[02:47:34.884 --> 02:47:36.085]  The book comes out today.
[02:47:36.085 --> 02:47:37.485]  It's in hard copy.
[02:47:37.485 --> 02:47:43.548]  The forward is by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is such a great patriot as well.
[02:47:43.548 --> 02:47:48.090]  And look, I saw this a year and a half ago as a failure forward.
[02:47:49.568 --> 02:47:52.969]  And then covering up their previous failures with a new, even bigger power grab.
[02:47:52.969 --> 02:47:56.751]  I'm concerned what the next big power grab is going to be and how they're going to cover up all the cancer and death.
[02:47:56.751 --> 02:48:02.132]  Well, they just manipulate the hospitals and have them blame the, quote, unvaccinated.
[02:48:02.132 --> 02:48:07.734]  But I have all the studies right here that it's the vaccinated are clearly shedding something off.
[02:48:07.734 --> 02:48:14.637]  But I like how your doctor talking about solutions like vitamin D, like ivermectin, like things like this.
[02:48:15.933 --> 02:48:23.764]  That the system is fighting so hard to cover up, and then on your side it's all the scientists and doctors and studies, on their side it's Rachel Maddow making fun of us.
[02:48:23.764 --> 02:48:31.194]  I'm just really not even mad at Rachel Maddow or the Young Turks and people attacking me by name, saying I'm an evil demon, telling people to take horse, horse based.
[02:48:31.975 --> 02:48:43.362]  I mean, I really feel sorry for them that for money, because you know, everybody's been offered money to sell out and promote this big pharma takeover, that literally for a few pieces of silver, they've done this.
[02:48:43.362 --> 02:48:46.424]  And I agree with you, there's no way they're going to get away with this.
[02:48:46.424 --> 02:48:49.325]  This is what psychos always do when they're cornered, they double down.
[02:48:49.325 --> 02:48:53.228]  And I see the world really waking up and all my sources say the same thing.
[02:48:53.228 --> 02:48:54.769]  I think that this is going to blow up in their face.
[02:48:54.769 --> 02:48:55.229]  What do you think?
[02:48:56.743 --> 02:49:00.207]  Absolutely, and my passion is to educate those doctors.
[02:49:00.207 --> 02:49:06.193]  Those oncologists that sat in there and said, oh no, we tested, she doesn't have it, but you don't do the test.
[02:49:06.193 --> 02:49:07.374]  Look at the immune system.
[02:49:07.374 --> 02:49:09.256]  She doesn't have a parasitic infection.
[02:49:09.256 --> 02:49:11.479]  We won't use ivermectin.
[02:49:11.479 --> 02:49:14.662]  We'll just keep giving her chemotherapy.
[02:49:14.662 --> 02:49:15.463]  I forgive them.
[02:49:16.644 --> 02:49:28.608]  You know, what I'm trying to do in my world is learn to learn to find a way to explain this because to wake up these hardcore people who have been indoctrinated.
[02:49:28.608 --> 02:49:37.811]  That's why the second part of Plandemic Indoctrination, which aired with David Martin and Mickey Willis, August 18th of 2020.
[02:49:37.811 --> 02:49:40.611]  That's why that was so important.
[02:49:40.611 --> 02:49:42.072]  They walk you through
[02:49:42.572 --> 02:49:47.157]  How we as a country, as a nation, as a world have been fooled.
[02:49:47.157 --> 02:49:56.005]  And what we have to do right now is every one of us wake up, speak the truth in love, and teach the doctors.
[02:49:56.005 --> 02:49:59.529]  We didn't make a mistake, you know.
[02:49:59.529 --> 02:50:03.813]  And the reason I say we didn't make a mistake is because we knew.
[02:50:04.393 --> 02:50:07.275]  We knew the spike alone causes disease.
[02:50:07.275 --> 02:50:10.137]  That's what we were told all the way through 2020.
[02:50:10.137 --> 02:50:18.642]  So why were we so foolish as to allow someone to inject the spike protein as synthetic virus, synthetic lipid nanobar?
[02:50:18.642 --> 02:50:19.463]  It's a virus.
[02:50:19.463 --> 02:50:25.426]  They injected you with billions of copy of a synthetic virus that can't be broken down by the immune system.
[02:50:25.426 --> 02:50:26.147]  We can tell
[02:50:26.967 --> 02:50:31.391]  If you have vaccine COVID, do the correct PCR.
[02:50:31.391 --> 02:50:36.295]  You will do the PCR looking only for the spike protein or look for antibodies.
[02:50:36.295 --> 02:50:39.998]  You can do an antibody test, proteins, immunoblot.
[02:50:39.998 --> 02:50:43.121]  Look for the spike protein alone.
[02:50:43.121 --> 02:50:45.863]  You won't find the core of a coronavirus.
[02:50:45.863 --> 02:50:49.386]  You won't find the structural proteins of a coronavirus.
[02:50:49.386 --> 02:50:49.727]  That's right.
[02:50:49.727 --> 02:50:52.349]  That's why all these universities have never isolated a whole virus.
[02:50:52.349 --> 02:50:53.190]  It's only the shell.
[02:50:54.212 --> 02:50:56.174]  Correct him, but that's what you've injected.
[02:50:56.174 --> 02:51:07.188]  So if you want to know if the people are sick in your hospitals with vaccine COVID that was transmitted from a health care worker, no health care worker wants to make their cancer patient sick.
[02:51:07.188 --> 02:51:11.734]  And yet they're wearing a mask and blowing the particles on cancer patients.
[02:51:12.074 --> 02:51:14.195]  The doctors won't even let him get near her.
[02:51:14.195 --> 02:51:14.676]  It's incredible.
[02:51:29.745 --> 02:51:32.569]  Neither would the doctors let us near our daughter-in-law.
[02:51:32.569 --> 02:51:33.250]  It's incredible.
[02:51:33.250 --> 02:51:37.475]  They will not let you use a safe, effective therapy.
[02:51:37.475 --> 02:51:39.537]  They wouldn't let us try.
[02:51:39.537 --> 02:51:40.178]  They wouldn't let us.
[02:51:40.178 --> 02:51:41.339]  You have the right to try.
[02:51:41.339 --> 02:51:46.045]  But see, when we say the doctors wouldn't let us near us, then it's up to us.
[02:51:46.045 --> 02:51:47.046]  No thank you.
[02:51:47.046 --> 02:51:47.747]  Don't go there.
[02:51:48.007 --> 02:51:49.288]  No, I agree.
[02:51:49.288 --> 02:51:51.791]  They keep acting like they're gods, so let's expand on this.
[02:51:51.791 --> 02:51:57.517]  One hospital will give the ivermectin, they have great success, but the Japanese expose, and then the next hospital won't.
[02:51:57.517 --> 02:52:03.403]  So the good news is there are a lot of hospitals getting it, but now we're learning they're persecuting doctors that actually do this.
[02:52:03.403 --> 02:52:04.364]  I mean, this is crazy!
[02:52:05.742 --> 02:52:06.402]  Correct.
[02:52:06.402 --> 02:52:08.363]  So we have to get out of the system.
[02:52:08.363 --> 02:52:13.865]  We have to encourage doctors to get out of their system and create our own.
[02:52:13.865 --> 02:52:15.025]  No more health insurance.
[02:52:15.025 --> 02:52:15.986]  No more money.
[02:52:15.986 --> 02:52:16.946]  No more taxes.
[02:52:16.946 --> 02:52:19.527]  No more free flu shot at Vons.
[02:52:19.527 --> 02:52:20.588]  They're not free, folks.
[02:52:20.588 --> 02:52:22.068]  They're killing it.
[02:52:22.068 --> 02:52:24.669]  They're destroying our country.
[02:52:24.669 --> 02:52:26.750]  You know, it's time if no one
[02:52:27.350 --> 02:52:31.593]  Took another shot ever, and they are all deadly.
[02:52:31.593 --> 02:52:34.695]  Every viral vaccine has coronaviruses.
[02:52:34.695 --> 02:52:40.239]  Every viral vaccine has recombinants of HIV, SIV, XMRV.
[02:52:40.239 --> 02:52:44.281]  Every flu shot could be the last shot you get.
[02:52:44.281 --> 02:52:45.162]  Could kill you.
[02:52:45.422 --> 02:52:46.162]  Absolutely.
[02:52:46.162 --> 02:52:54.645]  I know so many women that go on trips, my wife's friends and stuff, that would like go to Vietnam or go and take some vaccines and a year later they're dead.
[02:52:54.645 --> 02:52:56.005]  Why is it always lung cancer?
[02:52:56.005 --> 02:52:57.386]  These women don't even smoke.
[02:52:57.386 --> 02:53:01.907]  But it's so many women I know that are young that I go to their funerals where they just get lung cancer now.
[02:53:03.592 --> 02:53:16.056]  We see the pathogenesis in the pathways because a lot, and you just want to correct you briefly, Bobby Kennedy's foreword was our book, Plague of Corruption, which came out April 14th of 2020.
[02:53:16.056 --> 02:53:17.877]  Sure, I just saw a quote.
[02:53:17.877 --> 02:53:18.917]  I'm plugging your new book here.
[02:53:20.334 --> 02:53:25.876]  And so what Bobby shows in that forward is simian virus 40.
[02:53:25.876 --> 02:53:30.677]  Simian virus 40 contaminated and it's a lung cancer causing virus.
[02:53:30.677 --> 02:53:39.340]  And so the more vaccines you get, the more, not just SV40, what SV40 means is that's the 40th virus that was found.
[02:53:39.340 --> 02:53:41.381]  You know, think about the variants in the sequences.
[02:53:41.701 --> 02:53:47.543]  Not all human immune deficiency viruses are associated with any kind of disease.
[02:53:47.543 --> 02:53:49.684]  That's why they can't be causative.
[02:53:49.684 --> 02:53:53.266]  So the variants are all in the shots all along.
[02:53:53.266 --> 02:53:54.866]  You're not just saying this.
[02:53:54.866 --> 02:54:03.750]  I saw FDA documents from the 70s where they estimated 100 million Americans were infected with SV40 from the liquid polio.
[02:54:05.468 --> 02:54:06.108]  Correct.
[02:54:06.108 --> 02:54:08.830]  And this is what Bobby did so well in that forward.
[02:54:08.830 --> 02:54:10.851]  And this has been known for decades.
[02:54:10.851 --> 02:54:16.673]  And that is a virus associated with a type of lung cancer called mesothelioma.
[02:54:16.673 --> 02:54:23.637]  But the XMRV families have variants that are associated with a deadly non, you know, it has nothing to do with
[02:54:24.717 --> 02:54:26.039]  Let me raise this.
[02:54:26.039 --> 02:54:33.106]  What about all these new mystery lung illnesses and CDC warns of potential fall outbreak of rare polio-like illness?
[02:54:33.106 --> 02:54:34.568]  Well, I've already talked to nurses and doctors.
[02:54:34.568 --> 02:54:40.614]  They say already they're seeing thousands of kids just in Texas that are paralyzed, but they won't say it's polio.
[02:54:40.614 --> 02:54:42.696]  And the word is it's their parents were vaccinated.
[02:54:42.696 --> 02:54:43.377]  What's going on there?
[02:54:44.400 --> 02:54:48.163]  This has been going on for five, maybe ten years.
[02:54:48.163 --> 02:54:56.088]  And every case of polio caused in our country and perhaps our world is caused by the vaccine.
[02:54:56.088 --> 02:54:59.370]  You injected the viruses.
[02:54:59.370 --> 02:55:00.811]  It's a different strain.
[02:55:00.811 --> 02:55:02.152]  It's a different variant.
[02:55:02.152 --> 02:55:04.914]  So the CDC won't call it polio.
[02:55:04.914 --> 02:55:10.418]  The CDC renamed it as acute flaccid myelitis.
[02:55:11.218 --> 02:55:14.380]  Polio, clinically indistinguishable.
[02:55:14.380 --> 02:55:17.041]  This is what people have to understand.
[02:55:17.041 --> 02:55:21.644]  For 40 years, it's been infection by injection.
[02:55:21.644 --> 02:55:24.065]  These aren't new diseases.
[02:55:24.065 --> 02:55:27.888]  You know, this was the important things of our discoveries.
[02:55:27.888 --> 02:55:39.234]  We discovered, oh my God, how many new viruses have we created by injecting animal tissues, aborted fetal tissues from other humans into individuals.
[02:55:39.694 --> 02:55:50.724]  It's not one new virus, how many old diseases, as John Coffin wrote in a paper, an opinion paper that published in the journal Science, but when our
[02:55:56.328 --> 02:56:05.933]  A groundbreaking, paradigm-shifting, you know, world global pandemic ending paper published October 8th of 2009.
[02:56:05.933 --> 02:56:07.834]  October 8th of 2009.
[02:56:07.834 --> 02:56:16.578]  And that family of viruses was associated with lung cancers, with all of these things, and the explosion, the big discovery
[02:56:16.578 --> 02:56:17.700]  Let's expand on that.
[02:56:17.700 --> 02:56:22.366]  Bill Gates and Fauci write books saying there's too many people, so they're doing this on purpose.
[02:56:34.602 --> 02:56:35.683]  Wow.
[02:56:35.683 --> 02:56:40.726]  Doc, just an incredible interview and I've got to go to break.
[02:56:40.726 --> 02:56:43.988]  If you can do five more minutes the next hour, that little short segment, you've got to go.
[02:56:43.988 --> 02:56:45.889]  I understand, but I can't wait to read the book.
[02:56:45.889 --> 02:56:51.133]  We've had a lot of great guests on, but you've been the most on target, the most hardcore, because all I do is read news.
[02:56:51.133 --> 02:56:54.455]  And everything you're saying, the crew just types in and pulls up mainstream news.
[02:56:54.455 --> 02:56:57.577]  What's incredible is everything you're saying is actually admitted.
[02:56:57.577 --> 02:56:59.078]  The public is just ignorant of it.
[02:57:00.686 --> 02:57:02.146]  And the data are supported.
[02:57:02.146 --> 02:57:02.906]  I'm a scientist.
[02:57:02.906 --> 02:57:04.547]  I speak only data.
[02:57:04.547 --> 02:57:16.589]  I'll give you my opinion offline, but nothing I said isn't backed up by a reference in one of the three books in our thousands of pages, including direct emails from Tony Fauci and scientific... Hold on, we've got to go to break for two minutes.
[02:57:16.589 --> 02:57:22.610]  You'll have five minutes to finish up on Fauci, and then you say you're going to come on sometime next week for a full hour commercial-free.
[02:57:22.610 --> 02:57:23.490]  Wow.
[02:57:23.490 --> 02:57:25.550]  Folks, this interview's got to go viral.
[02:57:25.550 --> 02:57:28.371]  I know there are probably two million people watching right now.
[02:57:29.400 --> 02:57:38.591]  If you'll all decide to go to band.video tonight or freeworldnews.tv and grab this once it's archived, and just share it, and tell people to share it, it'll get 5 million views.
[02:57:38.591 --> 02:57:40.574]  I want to stop these monsters.
[02:57:40.574 --> 02:57:42.296]  I want to send them to prison.
[02:57:42.296 --> 02:57:43.097]  And we can do it!
[02:57:43.097 --> 02:57:43.958]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:46.576 --> 02:57:48.136]  Gerald in South Carolina.
[02:57:48.136 --> 02:57:49.657]  Go ahead, you're on the air, trying to move quicker.
[02:57:49.657 --> 02:57:50.477]  Hey, Alex.
[02:57:50.477 --> 02:57:50.917]  Welcome.
[02:57:50.917 --> 02:57:56.078]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason in amongst all this stupidity.
[02:57:56.078 --> 02:57:59.439]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[02:57:59.439 --> 02:58:05.900]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[02:58:05.900 --> 02:58:07.561]  Living Defense saved my life.
[02:58:07.561 --> 02:58:11.722]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[02:58:11.722 --> 02:58:13.162]  Living Defense brought me back.
[02:58:13.462 --> 02:58:18.864]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[02:58:18.864 --> 02:58:21.385]  This is Matthew 24 verse 9.
[02:58:21.385 --> 02:58:30.688]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[02:58:30.688 --> 02:58:36.109]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[02:58:36.109 --> 02:58:37.630]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[02:58:37.850 --> 02:58:45.380]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say, and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[02:58:47.921 --> 02:58:52.766]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[02:58:52.766 --> 02:58:54.827]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[02:58:54.827 --> 02:59:00.312]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[02:59:00.312 --> 02:59:01.413]  But we failed.
[02:59:01.413 --> 02:59:03.055]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[02:59:03.055 --> 02:59:04.937]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed.
[02:59:04.937 --> 02:59:10.101]  But they are going ahead with their full operational de-industrialization, Great Reset.
[02:59:10.862 --> 02:59:19.786]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[02:59:19.786 --> 02:59:24.968]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[02:59:24.968 --> 02:59:27.870]  And one of the number one things to do is high-quality, storable food.
[02:59:27.870 --> 02:59:32.652]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarestore.com.
[02:59:32.652 --> 02:59:37.774]  So whether it's a month or a six-month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[02:59:38.194 --> 02:59:43.101]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines in wait.
[02:59:43.101 --> 02:59:45.444]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[02:59:45.444 --> 02:59:49.911]  Get ready at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:59:49.911 --> 02:59:52.555]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:04.926 --> 03:00:05.966]  Well, I'm impressed.
[03:00:05.966 --> 03:00:10.108]  Dr. Judy A. Mikovic has been aware of her for many years.
[03:00:10.108 --> 03:00:10.868]  And she's with us.
[03:00:10.868 --> 03:00:12.369]  She's going to join us again sometime next week.
[03:00:12.369 --> 03:00:19.292]  She was trying to get into Fauci as we hit that break, talking about the emails, the documents, the admissions.
[03:00:19.292 --> 03:00:22.353]  And again, everything she's saying, we're just pulling it up while she says it.
[03:00:22.353 --> 03:00:23.754]  It's all hiding in plain view.
[03:00:23.754 --> 03:00:27.055]  So, closing key comments for folks about what else they should know.
[03:00:28.883 --> 03:00:38.889]  I think the closing key comments is stop looking at Fauci, the government, or anyone else to take control of your life.
[03:00:38.889 --> 03:00:43.732]  It's time you took control back of your body, of your health.
[03:00:43.732 --> 03:00:44.793]  This is where we are.
[03:00:44.793 --> 03:00:47.955]  We're telling you there are simple solutions.
[03:00:47.955 --> 03:00:56.180]  Now we've all, we all realize, and I don't, it's difficult to, you know, I don't,
[03:00:56.869 --> 03:00:58.730]  I don't care about him at all.
[03:00:58.730 --> 03:01:01.932]  He does everything by plausible deniability.
[03:01:01.932 --> 03:01:03.453]  Oh, I never had anything to do with Judy Meyer.
[03:01:03.453 --> 03:01:04.173]  Of course you didn't.
[03:01:04.173 --> 03:01:06.674]  You worked in Bethesda, NAIAD.
[03:01:06.674 --> 03:01:07.955]  You funded our studies.
[03:01:07.955 --> 03:01:22.923]  You took down my institute, that Neuroimmune Disease Institute, the first ever, because it started showing the connections between viruses that can cause cancer and can cause neuroimmune diseases, devastating diseases like Parkinson's, ALS.
[03:01:23.783 --> 03:01:28.786]  Lyme disease, myalgic encephalomyelitis, multiple sclerosis.
[03:01:28.786 --> 03:01:41.271]  Oh, directly caused by the same cytokine storms, the same pathways, where Tony Fauci put those diseases into the National Institute of Neurodevelopmental Diseases and Stroke.
[03:01:41.271 --> 03:01:44.172]  They're not neurodevelopmental diseases and stroke.
[03:01:44.172 --> 03:01:49.575]  They're the dysregulation of your God-given immune system and you allowed it to happen.
[03:01:50.316 --> 03:01:53.222]  Tony Fauci is not my God.
[03:01:53.222 --> 03:01:56.990]  I believe in only one God and I fear only one God.
[03:01:56.990 --> 03:01:58.935]  And that is, if we are...
[03:02:00.700 --> 03:02:09.146]  As you said in the last break, if we are one nation under God, this is indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
[03:02:09.146 --> 03:02:10.967]  Our immune system is God-given.
[03:02:10.967 --> 03:02:15.950]  Everything about our life is controlled by God.
[03:02:15.950 --> 03:02:19.272]  We trust God alone for our health.
[03:02:19.272 --> 03:02:20.053]  I always have.
[03:02:20.694 --> 03:02:22.055]  And I always will.
[03:02:22.055 --> 03:02:26.902]  And all I can try to do, as you try to do every day, is to teach people.
[03:02:26.902 --> 03:02:28.043]  You don't have to run.
[03:02:28.043 --> 03:02:30.106]  Fear is the disease.
[03:02:30.106 --> 03:02:31.848]  I'm not afraid of anything.
[03:02:32.407 --> 03:02:38.890]  Um, except not honoring biblical living, because God delivers on those promises.
[03:02:38.890 --> 03:02:40.410]  We have the health.
[03:02:40.410 --> 03:02:47.733]  You don't need another thing to fight variant du jour, whether it be Delta, Gamma, Omega, Epsilon.
[03:02:47.733 --> 03:02:48.793]  I don't care.
[03:02:48.793 --> 03:02:50.194]  You know, we can do this.
[03:02:50.194 --> 03:02:54.416]  That's why I mentioned my own my own infections.
[03:02:54.416 --> 03:02:55.136]  I worked
[03:02:55.616 --> 03:02:56.457]  We're good to go.
[03:03:25.316 --> 03:03:27.738]  Never did I ever wear a mask.
[03:03:27.738 --> 03:03:29.018]  Wake up, folks.
[03:03:29.018 --> 03:03:30.580]  Take off the mask.
[03:03:30.580 --> 03:03:33.061]  If he says it, do the opposite.
[03:03:33.061 --> 03:03:34.202]  This is how my mom did it.
[03:03:34.202 --> 03:03:34.462]  Absolutely.
[03:03:34.462 --> 03:03:36.564]  And here's the good news.
[03:03:36.564 --> 03:03:41.027]  Tedris, the U.N., Fauci, Gates, they don't look so cocky now.
[03:03:41.027 --> 03:03:42.007]  They look scared now.
[03:03:44.517 --> 03:03:44.977]  Yeah.
[03:03:44.977 --> 03:03:48.440]  And I don't have attacks on Tony Fauci.
[03:03:48.440 --> 03:03:51.062]  I don't care.
[03:03:51.062 --> 03:03:53.464]  Everything is science.
[03:03:53.464 --> 03:03:54.785]  I don't attack anyone.
[03:03:54.785 --> 03:04:04.413]  I show you the data and I speak the data and I translate the data and tell it to you in a way that hopefully you can understand with solutions.
[03:04:04.793 --> 03:04:07.978]  The blood supply was contaminated for almost 40 years.
[03:04:07.978 --> 03:04:13.406]  We identified a solution, serious technology, C-E-R-U-S.
[03:04:13.406 --> 03:04:17.331]  It's discussed in our book, Plague of Corruption.
[03:04:17.331 --> 03:04:19.715]  The technology decontaminates the blood supply.
[03:04:19.995 --> 03:04:26.319]  So why did Tony Fauci cover up that the XMRVs, that these viruses were spread through the blood supply?
[03:04:26.319 --> 03:04:40.368]  Why did he deny people with myalgic encephalomyelitis or autism the treatment, serum and ivermectin and antiretroviral therapies which are given as pre-exposure prophylaxis, now low-dose?
[03:04:40.368 --> 03:04:42.710]  Because he's a eugenicist criminal.
[03:04:42.710 --> 03:04:44.911]  Dr. Judy A. Mikovits, very impressed.
[03:04:44.911 --> 03:04:45.852]  Plugthebook.com.
[03:04:45.852 --> 03:04:46.972]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[03:04:46.972 --> 03:04:47.493]  Godspeed.
[03:04:48.444 --> 03:04:48.945]  Godspeed.
[03:04:48.945 --> 03:04:49.627]  Thank you.
[03:04:49.627 --> 03:04:50.329]  Amazing lady.
[03:04:50.329 --> 03:04:51.050]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:51.050 --> 03:04:52.293]  I'll introduce our next guest.
[03:04:52.293 --> 03:04:53.256]  Stay with us.
[03:04:53.256 --> 03:04:55.140]  Wow, that was powerful!
[03:04:57.236 --> 03:05:00.658]  In these insane times, I wouldn't mess around.
[03:05:00.658 --> 03:05:03.800]  I wouldn't screw around with your health and your immune system.
[03:05:03.800 --> 03:05:14.187]  I would do everything you can to boost your body's natural defenses and, at the same time, support those that are fighting the globalists and fighting to stop new lockdowns and tyranny.

[03:06:08.100 --> 03:06:10.145]  Well folks, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:10.145 --> 03:06:13.793]  I'm handing the baton to another great talk show host, Kate Dally.
[03:06:15.014 --> 03:06:16.736]  TateDallyShow.com here in just a moment.
[03:06:16.736 --> 03:06:20.399]  She's got some big guests on, another big whistleblower coming on.
[03:06:20.399 --> 03:06:21.900]  But, wow!
[03:06:21.900 --> 03:06:29.947]  Let me tell you, I'm more proud of those interviews that I just did with that doctor than I was having Trump on the show.
[03:06:29.947 --> 03:06:30.788]  That was powerful.
[03:06:30.788 --> 03:06:33.510]  That lady knows what she's talking about, Dr. Judy A. Mickiewicz.
[03:06:33.510 --> 03:06:36.933]  We're going to get her on next week for a commercial-free podcast.
[03:06:36.933 --> 03:06:38.714]  That was powerful.
[03:06:38.714 --> 03:06:42.157]  And so I want to thank her for coming on the show, finally got her on the broadcast.
[03:06:44.192 --> 03:06:45.792]  You got this guest host about to take over.
[03:06:45.792 --> 03:06:46.693]  She's loaded for bear.
[03:06:46.693 --> 03:06:47.933]  Then you got Owen at 3 p.m.
[03:06:47.933 --> 03:06:48.813]  today.
[03:06:48.813 --> 03:06:51.994]  I'm probably going to shoot a special report today because there's so much breaking news.
[03:06:51.994 --> 03:06:58.696]  I don't have time to get to right now, but the whole world government, the world IDs run by the Rockefellers and Bill Gates is now out in the open.
[03:06:58.696 --> 03:06:59.457]  People are freaking out.
[03:06:59.457 --> 03:07:00.177]  That's good.
[03:07:00.177 --> 03:07:04.578]  People should freak out because we put up with so much so long, they've now made their power move on us.

[03:08:16.495 --> 03:08:18.496]  And so it's the katedollyshow.com.
[03:08:18.496 --> 03:08:20.758]  Kate, thank you so much and God bless.
[03:08:25.650 --> 03:08:26.771]  Hi there!
[03:08:26.771 --> 03:08:27.411]  Welcome!
[03:08:27.411 --> 03:08:29.333]  And I'm so glad you're tuned in.
[03:08:29.333 --> 03:08:31.855]  I'm Kate Daly from The Kate Daly Show and really happy.
[03:08:31.855 --> 03:08:33.756]  Thank you, Alex, so much.
[03:08:33.756 --> 03:08:35.677]  What a pleasure it is to be here.
[03:08:35.677 --> 03:08:41.661]  In fact, I have several guests today and I cannot wait for you to listen to these two guests.
[03:08:41.661 --> 03:08:47.946]  One is taking a huge stand and the other one is going to be talking about as an ex-Pfizer employee.
[03:08:48.348 --> 03:08:52.171]  Is going to be talking about the vaccine, of course.
[03:08:52.171 --> 03:08:53.813]  Isn't that the topic of the day?
[03:08:53.813 --> 03:08:56.535]  Isn't it insane what we're having to deal with right now?
[03:08:56.535 --> 03:09:02.540]  All across the country, I'm hearing stories and I'm getting emails of people that are desperate.
[03:09:02.540 --> 03:09:04.401]  They know that their jobs are in question.
[03:09:04.401 --> 03:09:07.984]  They don't know what to do and they are literally desperate for help.
[03:09:07.984 --> 03:09:10.206]  And so we're going to try to do that today.
[03:09:10.206 --> 03:09:14.550]  There's so many things going on right now that are just insane to talk about.
[03:09:15.091 --> 03:09:17.393]  The commercial, did you guys get this?
[03:09:17.393 --> 03:09:32.608]  The commercial for 60 Seconds, and it was all about Australia's camp, well camp, 1,000 beds, and they're saying, oh hey, experts are wanting us to bring people from other countries into our little camp.
[03:09:32.608 --> 03:09:34.990]  And here's the rub.
[03:09:34.990 --> 03:09:37.693]  You get to have a balcony.
[03:09:38.191 --> 03:09:38.871]  And fresh air.
[03:09:38.871 --> 03:09:39.852]  You lucky dog.
[03:09:39.852 --> 03:09:46.734]  You you get to have your own balcony as you're confined like a prisoner in a in a covid camp.
[03:09:46.734 --> 03:09:51.016]  And all they could say was, hey, we need to keep people safe.
[03:09:51.016 --> 03:09:54.378]  I just love being so safe and wrapped in bubble wrap.
[03:09:54.378 --> 03:09:55.578]  It's awesome, isn't it?
[03:09:55.578 --> 03:10:02.321]  I'm just so happy for the safety concerns of all of all all around the world from a cold virus.
[03:10:02.321 --> 03:10:05.202]  But I was floored when I saw the
[03:10:08.416 --> 03:10:10.356]  You are going to love this camp.
[03:10:10.356 --> 03:10:12.397]  It's kind of like a little resort.
[03:10:12.397 --> 03:10:13.557]  You'll love it!
[03:10:13.557 --> 03:10:15.398]  You'll love it!
[03:10:15.398 --> 03:10:17.498]  I'm abhorred, you guys.
[03:10:17.498 --> 03:10:20.579]  I know that we think that this can't happen in this country.
[03:10:20.579 --> 03:10:22.579]  I know that we think that we're immune.
[03:10:22.579 --> 03:10:27.160]  And I think we honestly think that, well, we have all these things in place.
[03:10:27.160 --> 03:10:29.061]  But you know what?
[03:10:29.061 --> 03:10:31.982]  I'm not sure that we do.
[03:10:31.982 --> 03:10:38.103]  I'm not sure that it's going to amount in a situation where we're going to be able to fight it if we don't start standing strong.
[03:10:38.427 --> 03:10:45.409]  And that's what one of my guests from the LAFD, the Los Angeles Fire Department, is going to talk about today.
[03:10:45.409 --> 03:10:58.154]  Because as these agencies are taking a stand, this is going to be really great for our country as we watch these people take the stand and know that what they're doing is standing up for all of us.
[03:11:00.410 --> 03:11:04.892]  We have a distinct and serious problem going on.
[03:11:04.892 --> 03:11:09.694]  And if you choose not to take this vaccine, you shouldn't have to take this vaccine.
[03:11:09.694 --> 03:11:11.095]  Am I right?
[03:11:11.095 --> 03:11:13.116]  This should be about your choice.
[03:11:13.116 --> 03:11:22.340]  And of course, I have Karen Kingston, a former Pfizer employee and current analyst for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.
[03:11:22.340 --> 03:11:22.920]  Hi, Karen.
[03:11:22.920 --> 03:11:23.380]  How are you?
[03:11:23.380 --> 03:11:24.721]  Hi, Kate.
[03:11:24.721 --> 03:11:25.281]  Good to see you.
[03:11:25.281 --> 03:11:26.822]  Oh, you too.
[03:11:27.861 --> 03:11:38.384]  We've been chatting and I'm going to say that Karen is a strong, strong voice out there in talking about the things that you probably have the most concern about right now.
[03:11:38.384 --> 03:11:42.405]  And that is the force of an experimental shot and what's in it.
[03:11:42.405 --> 03:11:46.946]  And I think that this is probably one of the most important things we could be talking about today.
[03:11:46.946 --> 03:11:48.026]  It's on everybody's mind.
[03:11:48.739 --> 03:11:50.220]  It's getting shoved down our throats.
[03:11:50.220 --> 03:12:00.668]  And Karen, with your background, your legal, you know, kind of your, I would say, analyst expertise in looking at the patents, the Moderna patent.
[03:12:00.668 --> 03:12:02.510]  Let's talk about that.
[03:12:02.510 --> 03:12:06.232]  I'm floored about graphene oxide, all kinds of things.
[03:12:08.473 --> 03:12:11.815]  There's a couple points I want to talk about because you just mentioned what's going on in Australia.
[03:12:11.815 --> 03:12:21.601]  So it's really important for the American people to know that we currently are under attack by domestic terrorists that are promoting under the guise of promoting our health and safety of our community.
[03:12:21.601 --> 03:12:34.350]  And they're taking away our liberties and they're taking away our economy and they are poisoning and harming our adults, our military and our children under the guise of promoting protection of our communities and our health.
[03:12:34.350 --> 03:12:36.211]  So that's domestic terrorism.
[03:12:36.211 --> 03:12:37.732]  Just want to be clear about that.
[03:12:38.132 --> 03:12:39.013]  Thank you so much.
[03:12:55.431 --> 03:13:02.053]  And to report to the FDA per Section 614 of the U.S.
[03:13:02.053 --> 03:13:18.198]  Title Code 21, they have until September 6 to report to the FDA any biological product deviations from the product labeling, including all deviations, complaints, and adverse events regarding Comirnaty, which is BNT162B, which is the vaccine.
[03:13:18.198 --> 03:13:20.979]  So, we don't have confirmation of what's in these vials.
[03:13:21.727 --> 03:13:27.350]  And we don't have confirmation on the final numbers of the death and harm that they've caused to the American people so far.
[03:13:27.350 --> 03:13:29.331]  So I just want to be clear about that.
[03:13:29.331 --> 03:13:30.732]  I'm so glad you mentioned that.
[03:13:30.732 --> 03:13:34.114]  Graphene oxide is suspected in this shot.
[03:13:34.114 --> 03:13:36.195]  Did you want to talk about that?
[03:13:36.195 --> 03:13:37.356]  Yeah, sure.
[03:13:37.356 --> 03:13:42.378]  Again, I just wanted to be clear that these are not approved under the EUA.
[03:13:42.378 --> 03:13:43.339]  They cannot be mandated.
[03:13:43.820 --> 03:13:45.962]  Hold a stand there.
[03:13:45.962 --> 03:13:49.346]  You know, there's there's no benefit to being injected.
[03:13:49.346 --> 03:13:51.369]  I don't have that happening.
[03:13:51.369 --> 03:13:52.570]  There is no benefit.
[03:13:52.570 --> 03:13:53.851]  There is no benefit.
[03:13:53.851 --> 03:13:59.558]  I can't imagine somebody making this decision with all of this up in the air, the confusion alone.
[03:14:00.017 --> 03:14:00.778]  What in the world?
[03:14:00.778 --> 03:14:05.781]  You know, my husband was asking me, he said, he said, how do you know you're on the right side of this shot?
[03:14:05.781 --> 03:14:07.983]  And I said, it's really, really easy.
[03:14:07.983 --> 03:14:10.405]  Look who's trying to shove it down your throat.
[03:14:10.405 --> 03:14:12.266]  Look who's trying to give this to you.
[03:14:12.266 --> 03:14:17.570]  The very people that haven't been able to be trusted for hundreds of years.
[03:14:17.570 --> 03:14:23.434]  It is flooring to me that people are thinking, yeah, let's just jab this thing in our arm and see where it goes.
[03:14:25.054 --> 03:14:36.280]  of being guinea pigs right now for their trial that even the government admits it goes on until the year 2023, correct?
[03:14:36.280 --> 03:14:44.064]  The trial was upended in January of this year when they unblinded the placebo group and injected them.
[03:14:44.064 --> 03:14:49.707]  So, legally, technically, they should have started the trials all over again in January of this year.
[03:14:49.707 --> 03:14:50.988]  So, there are no trials.
[03:14:50.988 --> 03:14:53.449]  This is just a giant... Guinea pig.
[03:14:54.882 --> 03:14:57.984]  Well, it's bio-warfare is what it is.
[03:14:57.984 --> 03:15:00.125]  I just want to be clear, this is bio-warfare.
[03:15:00.125 --> 03:15:20.378]  I've gone over, I'm sorry, I'm getting frustrated because I know there's a lot of information I shared, but some of the stuff I've also shared is that if you go back and you take a look at the clinical research that was done to create these mRNA vaccines, they were done in conjunction with the People's Republic of China's military and scientists.
[03:15:21.366 --> 03:15:22.626]  There's no gray area.
[03:15:22.626 --> 03:15:24.907]  What's going on here anymore?
[03:15:24.907 --> 03:15:27.708]  There's no benefit to being.
[03:15:27.708 --> 03:15:30.549]  Yeah, I think it's a great point to go that far.
[03:15:30.549 --> 03:15:32.250]  And it really needs to go that far.
[03:15:32.250 --> 03:15:34.430]  I know we have a break coming up, but I understand.
[03:15:34.430 --> 03:15:36.891]  And when you say bio warfare.
[03:15:36.891 --> 03:15:37.992]  Yes, I absolutely.
[03:15:37.992 --> 03:15:38.772]  I agree with you.
[03:15:38.772 --> 03:15:39.392]  I agree with you.
[03:15:42.884 --> 03:15:44.545]  The entire world right now.
[03:15:44.545 --> 03:15:46.066]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:46.066 --> 03:15:50.028]  And I'm Kate Dally from The Kate Dally Show, katedallyradio.com.
[03:15:50.028 --> 03:15:51.088]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:51.088 --> 03:15:52.029]  More with Karen Kingston.
[03:15:56.539 --> 03:16:02.881]  What if you could cut your heating bills this winter with your existing wood burning fireplace and not spend thousands doing it?
[03:16:02.881 --> 03:16:05.862]  You can with Great Wall of Fire Fireplace Grates.

[03:16:26.926 --> 03:16:27.727]  Hey, everybody.
[03:16:27.727 --> 03:16:30.969]  Confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[03:16:30.969 --> 03:16:31.729]  Me too.
[03:16:31.729 --> 03:16:38.834]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[03:16:38.834 --> 03:16:43.237]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[03:16:43.237 --> 03:16:45.118]  You probably already believe that.
[03:16:45.118 --> 03:16:46.139]  I certainly do.
[03:16:46.139 --> 03:16:47.079]  So here's the thing.
[03:16:47.079 --> 03:16:55.405]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.

[03:17:26.860 --> 03:17:28.061]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:17:28.061 --> 03:17:32.003]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:32.003 --> 03:17:33.523]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:33.523 --> 03:17:36.485]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:36.485 --> 03:17:42.048]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:42.048 --> 03:17:43.248]  I can help you, too.
[03:17:43.248 --> 03:17:46.190]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:46.190 --> 03:17:48.411]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:48.411 --> 03:17:52.853]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.

[03:17:57.341 --> 03:17:58.681]  It's always critical.
[03:17:58.681 --> 03:17:59.662]  It's always vital.
[03:17:59.662 --> 03:18:03.602]  It's always essential to have enough high quality vitamins and minerals in your body.
[03:18:03.602 --> 03:18:06.523]  That's why essential vitamins and minerals are called essential.
[03:18:06.523 --> 03:18:07.643]  You must have them.
[03:18:07.643 --> 03:18:13.625]  But in today's crazy times, it is more important than ever to stay on top of it.
[03:18:13.625 --> 03:18:16.565]  And the Vitamin Mineral Fusion has been sold out for months and months and months.
[03:18:16.565 --> 03:18:19.406]  It's got all the essential vitamins and minerals and amino acids.
[03:18:19.406 --> 03:18:19.766]  It is

[03:19:36.013 --> 03:19:37.173]  And we have our new bed.
[03:19:37.173 --> 03:19:39.594]  Everybody, I don't know if you've seen our bed infomercial.
[03:19:39.594 --> 03:19:41.515]  I developed this bed over a year and a half.
[03:19:41.515 --> 03:19:43.356]  Best mattress you'll ever sleep on.
[03:19:43.356 --> 03:19:45.977]  It's a combination of coils and patented foam.
[03:19:45.977 --> 03:19:47.277]  And this, they're amazing.
[03:19:47.277 --> 03:19:48.078]  There's nothing better.
[03:19:49.178 --> 03:19:52.039]  It's amazing that the cost is not high and you support freedom.
[03:19:52.039 --> 03:19:53.880]  MyPillow.com, promo code Alex.
[03:19:53.880 --> 03:20:00.884]  You've got so many great products and we're just really proud of the work you're doing, Mike.
[03:20:00.884 --> 03:20:03.545]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:23.353 --> 03:20:24.534]  Hi, back here with you.
[03:20:24.534 --> 03:20:26.915]  Hi, back here with you.
[03:20:26.915 --> 03:20:29.256]  I am Kate Dally from the Kate Dally Show.
[03:20:29.256 --> 03:20:31.057]  A big thank you to Alex.
[03:20:31.057 --> 03:20:33.058]  I have Karen Kingston.
[03:20:33.058 --> 03:20:40.302]  She is the former Pfizer employee and current analyst for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.
[03:20:40.302 --> 03:20:42.423]  So I welcome Karen back to the show.
[03:20:42.423 --> 03:20:44.024]  And she has a lot to say.
[03:20:44.024 --> 03:20:46.545]  I'm really excited to have her on with me.
[03:20:46.545 --> 03:20:50.187]  I want to talk about plasma DNA in these vaccines, Karen.
[03:20:50.858 --> 03:20:52.760]  How it's changing human DNA.
[03:20:52.760 --> 03:20:57.564]  I think so many people might not understand what is actually going on with this too.
[03:20:57.564 --> 03:20:58.245]  And Hydrogel.
[03:20:58.245 --> 03:21:01.908]  Let's talk about both.
[03:21:01.908 --> 03:21:02.169]  Sure.
[03:21:02.169 --> 03:21:10.496]  With regards to Hydrogel, let's just attack that first because it's related to the war that's going on between the United States and China.
[03:21:10.496 --> 03:21:13.599]  And I know, or sorry, the People's Republic of China and the CCP.
[03:21:14.961 --> 03:21:32.634]  I understand that people in America don't seem to be aware of this, but if you read the newspapers from the People's Republic of China, whether it's China Daily News, Xinhua News, or Global Times, there's a number of articles, such as this one, which is recounting the seven sins of the U.S.
[03:21:32.634 --> 03:21:33.654]  alliance system.
[03:21:33.654 --> 03:21:37.938]  And I mean, they clearly state there will be severe penalties for the seven sins committed by the U.S.
[03:21:37.938 --> 03:21:38.358]  justice.
[03:21:38.678 --> 03:21:39.700]  We're good to go.
[03:21:49.349 --> 03:21:58.473]  We are lucky enough to witness these profound changes and 500 years of Western domination coming to an end and Americans gnashing their teeth in hell is basically what this says.
[03:21:58.473 --> 03:22:05.256]  So, I want to be clear that we are in war and there's bio-warfare going on.
[03:22:05.256 --> 03:22:08.178]  In regards to hydrogel, there's a couple important points.
[03:22:08.178 --> 03:22:10.479]  One, there was a patent filed
[03:22:10.899 --> 03:22:11.239]  I think so.
[03:22:30.945 --> 03:22:31.385]  Thank you.
[03:22:42.740 --> 03:22:49.184]  And Hydrogel being in these injections, make no mistake, it is irrefutably in there.
[03:22:49.184 --> 03:22:50.105]  So this is, again, U.S.
[03:22:50.105 --> 03:22:52.507]  Patent 10703789.
[03:22:52.507 --> 03:22:54.968]  The abstract describes the art.
[03:22:54.968 --> 03:22:58.070]  The art is a description of the technology.
[03:22:58.070 --> 03:23:07.336]  Basically, verbatim, it says that it is a lipid nanoparticles with the size of 80 to 160 nanometers, exactly the size of what's going to be in these
[03:23:08.697 --> 03:23:09.237]  Thank you.
[03:23:28.758 --> 03:23:38.525]  Disclosed herein may be encapsulated into any hydrogel known in the art, so the description what's in here, which may form a gel when injected into a subject.
[03:23:38.525 --> 03:23:44.350]  Hydrogels are a network of polymer chains that are hydrophilic and sometimes found as a colloidal gel.
[03:23:44.350 --> 03:23:47.112]  They're highly absorbent, naturally synthetic polymers.
[03:23:47.112 --> 03:23:52.657]  Now keep in mind it says you're going to be injected with a gel that's going to form its own gel.
[03:23:52.657 --> 03:23:55.599]  So these are pre-programmed and they know how to create their own
[03:23:56.550 --> 03:23:58.971]  It's a miniature system within your body.
[03:23:58.971 --> 03:24:03.211]  It's a form of artificial intelligence and advanced technology.
[03:24:03.211 --> 03:24:05.732]  And hydrogel is made of graphene oxide.
[03:24:05.732 --> 03:24:06.872]  Again, that's irrefutable.
[03:24:06.872 --> 03:24:17.175]  There's literally hundreds and hundreds of studies that you can find on our own NIH.gov website regarding graphene oxide in hydrogel.
[03:24:17.175 --> 03:24:23.576]  So the reason why graphene oxide is in these is because it is a great conductor of an electromagnetic field.
[03:24:24.236 --> 03:24:42.916]  So, if you go on to continue to read this patent, you'll find another patent that relates to the use of these hydrogel lipid nanoparticles being able to communicate and exchange data and signals with an external wireless device that was developed in collaboration with Qualcomm.
[03:24:45.376 --> 03:24:47.197]  And it talks about the subjects who are injected.
[03:24:47.197 --> 03:25:02.288]  Again, you can exchange data and signals from a wireless device to those subjects who have been injected with these vaccines, which are bioweapons that contain lipid nanoparticle graphene oxide hydrogel.
[03:25:02.288 --> 03:25:07.793]  So what that means is the subjects are the American people, our children, and our military.
[03:25:07.793 --> 03:25:08.253]  We're at war.
[03:25:10.529 --> 03:25:13.732]  It just, I think people have to absorb this.
[03:25:13.732 --> 03:25:16.734]  They need to understand what is in these shots.
[03:25:16.734 --> 03:25:23.300]  And I can't imagine why CNN and ABC and all of these networks aren't just running with this story.
[03:25:23.300 --> 03:25:31.447]  Karen, it is insanity that we do not even know what's in the shot and people are signing up for it left and right out of guilt and shame.
[03:25:31.447 --> 03:25:33.348]  And I just still can't believe it.
[03:25:33.348 --> 03:25:38.953]  Even when you're saying these things, I think the American people still cannot believe what we're injecting ourselves with.
[03:25:39.673 --> 03:25:42.554]  Because of a fear of a common cold.
[03:25:42.554 --> 03:25:47.074]  Well, you know, it's not just because of a fear of a common cold, it's because of public shaming.
[03:25:47.074 --> 03:26:05.398]  Former President Reagan, at a rally for Barry Goldwater in 1964, I think he was quoting Alexander Hamilton, he goes, you know, those societies, those nations who would prefer disgrace to defeat are ready for a master, their servants are ready for a master, and quite frankly, they deserve one.
[03:26:05.398 --> 03:26:06.478]  If God's people
[03:26:09.779 --> 03:26:12.820]  Remain silent, we will be enslaved.
[03:26:12.820 --> 03:26:16.420]  The truth cannot prevail if we don't speak up.
[03:26:16.420 --> 03:26:28.823]  So I call upon all Christians, all God-fearing men and women, to start speaking up about the truth of the harm, damage, poison, and death that these injections are bringing upon American people and our children.
[03:26:28.823 --> 03:26:34.764]  For goodness sake, the left, the enemy, is going around touting how we all need to get injected.
[03:26:34.764 --> 03:26:36.324]  We can't just remain silent.
[03:26:36.624 --> 03:26:38.606]  That is not a way to fight the enemy.
[03:26:38.606 --> 03:26:39.507]  That is not biblical.
[03:26:39.507 --> 03:26:40.548]  That is not in scripture.
[03:26:40.548 --> 03:26:45.532]  We have a covenant with God to put on the armor of God and the sword.
[03:26:45.532 --> 03:26:47.134]  The sword is the sword of truth.
[03:26:47.134 --> 03:26:48.074]  It is the word.
[03:26:48.074 --> 03:26:50.396]  It is the written and spoken word.
[03:26:50.396 --> 03:26:52.318]  Speak up and show up.
[03:26:52.318 --> 03:26:54.120]  That's the only way we can defeat this.
[03:26:54.120 --> 03:26:57.463]  We can't pray for Trump to come in on a white horse and just save us one day.
[03:26:57.463 --> 03:27:01.066]  Oh, bless you, Karen Kingston.
[03:27:01.066 --> 03:27:03.028]  I'm so happy that you're bringing this out.
[03:27:04.537 --> 03:27:05.077]  You know what?
[03:27:05.077 --> 03:27:07.459]  We're all fired up, as we should be.
[03:27:07.459 --> 03:27:11.523]  We, as a nation, should be fired up as to what is going on right now.
[03:27:11.523 --> 03:27:14.825]  And these injections are so dangerous.
[03:27:14.825 --> 03:27:16.126]  It is war.
[03:27:16.126 --> 03:27:18.308]  It is war upon the people.
[03:27:18.308 --> 03:27:19.689]  And we have to treat it as such.
[03:27:19.689 --> 03:27:20.630]  You are right.
[03:27:20.630 --> 03:27:21.771]  You're 100% right.
[03:27:21.771 --> 03:27:22.592]  Can't argue with you.
[03:27:22.592 --> 03:27:23.973]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:27:23.973 --> 03:27:31.379]  And I think knowing that what this can do inside the body, how it changes us, is crucial to understanding what's going on here.
[03:27:32.458 --> 03:27:37.860]  And speaking of that, the plasmid DNA, if you want to get to that, I mean truly it changes you inside the body.
[03:27:37.860 --> 03:27:43.523]  That was not released to any of the American people or global citizens.
[03:27:43.523 --> 03:27:52.587]  Plasmid DNA, so I found it because AGC Biologics is the number one manufacturer for the BioNTech Pfizer vaccine for plasmid DNA.
[03:27:53.187 --> 03:28:00.932]  The only purpose of plasma DNA is to produce new chromosomal DNA within your body.
[03:28:00.932 --> 03:28:04.494]  It can be bacterial, viral, and or from another species.
[03:28:04.494 --> 03:28:06.656]  It literally changes the DNA.
[03:28:06.656 --> 03:28:11.259]  So the way that God created us, we were formed perfectly within our mother's wombs.
[03:28:11.259 --> 03:28:14.561]  We were formed perfectly in the image of God.
[03:28:15.041 --> 03:28:20.262]  Satan can only deceive, steal, and destroy to God's children.
[03:28:20.262 --> 03:28:24.683]  That is his intention, and that is what's happening when you're injected with these vaccines.
[03:28:24.683 --> 03:28:32.585]  The code that God used to create us perfectly within his image has now been hijacked by the enemy.
[03:28:32.585 --> 03:28:35.245]  So you are no longer... This is a spiritual war.
[03:28:35.245 --> 03:28:37.306]  It's a spiritual war.
[03:28:37.306 --> 03:28:38.646]  We have to go to a great parent.
[03:28:39.426 --> 03:28:41.347]  I'm just loving that you're talking about this.
[03:28:41.347 --> 03:28:42.808]  Thank you for your courage.
[03:28:42.808 --> 03:28:47.492]  And in talking about this, I know that probably isn't easy, and I really appreciate it.
[03:28:47.492 --> 03:28:48.152]  I mean, easy for you.
[03:28:48.152 --> 03:28:50.894]  I think you're a very strong woman, and I just really appreciate you.
[03:28:50.894 --> 03:28:55.817]  Karen Kingston, former Pfizer and analyst, thank you very, very much.
[03:28:55.817 --> 03:28:56.818]  I wanted to hear this.
[03:28:56.818 --> 03:29:07.466]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly, for prayer, for financial support.
[03:29:08.146 --> 03:29:08.867]  We're good to go.
[03:29:31.281 --> 03:29:32.462]  Our credibility is going up.
[03:29:32.462 --> 03:29:34.083]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[03:29:34.083 --> 03:29:36.225]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[03:29:36.225 --> 03:29:40.628]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still quasi-free.
[03:29:40.628 --> 03:29:45.772]  You can't have InfoWars, which has been proven right, being on air, with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[03:29:45.772 --> 03:29:47.854]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[03:29:47.854 --> 03:29:50.496]  So thank you all, and get into InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:29:50.496 --> 03:29:53.998]  Get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements, and so much more.
[03:29:53.998 --> 03:29:55.760]  They're wonderful products, and they support the InfoWars.
[03:29:55.760 --> 03:29:56.000]  Thank you.
[03:29:57.290 --> 03:30:02.155]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[03:30:02.155 --> 03:30:04.196]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[03:30:04.196 --> 03:30:09.681]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[03:30:09.681 --> 03:30:10.782]  But we failed.
[03:30:10.782 --> 03:30:12.444]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[03:30:12.444 --> 03:30:14.306]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed.
[03:30:14.306 --> 03:30:19.370]  But they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization, Great Reset.
[03:30:20.311 --> 03:30:29.237]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[03:30:29.237 --> 03:30:34.420]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[03:30:34.420 --> 03:30:37.342]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storable food.
[03:30:37.342 --> 03:30:42.105]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarestore.com.
[03:30:42.105 --> 03:30:47.268]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[03:30:47.668 --> 03:30:52.570]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines in wait.
[03:30:52.570 --> 03:30:54.891]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[03:30:54.891 --> 03:30:57.492]  Get ready at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:30:57.492 --> 03:31:09.217]  Bioremediation is a process used to treat contaminated water, soil, and subsurface material by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade targeted pollutants.
[03:31:09.517 --> 03:31:16.600]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[03:31:16.600 --> 03:31:23.782]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[03:31:23.782 --> 03:31:28.604]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[03:31:28.604 --> 03:31:30.564]  This stuff lives in your septic system.

[03:33:22.133 --> 03:33:27.475]  So happy to be back with you and a big thank you to Karen Kingston for talking about what is in the shot.
[03:33:27.475 --> 03:33:28.715]  We really need to know this.
[03:33:28.715 --> 03:33:34.377]  I'm surprised more people aren't asking more questions about what's in that frankenshot, as Alex calls it.
[03:33:34.377 --> 03:33:37.178]  I love that term.
[03:33:37.178 --> 03:33:39.039]  You can go to katedallyradio.com.
[03:33:39.039 --> 03:33:40.339]  You can stream my show live.
[03:33:40.339 --> 03:33:45.501]  All you have to do is click listen live from the website katedallyradio.com for more on all these subjects.
[03:33:45.501 --> 03:33:46.381]  We cover them daily.
[03:33:47.014 --> 03:33:49.737]  And I appreciate being here as your guest host.
[03:33:49.737 --> 03:33:58.664]  My next guest I want to introduce you to is a powerful voice in California, John Knox, Los Angeles Fire Department Firefighter Paramedic.
[03:33:58.664 --> 03:34:05.991]  So grateful to have him on with me because the firefighters in Los Angeles are taking a stand.
[03:34:05.991 --> 03:34:10.855]  And they are telling firefighters all over the country, you can take a stand too.
[03:34:11.328 --> 03:34:12.449]  Which is really amazing.
[03:34:12.449 --> 03:34:19.752]  We really need to have big groups, big county employee groups stand up in opposition to the force.
[03:34:19.752 --> 03:34:25.274]  And so, of course, I welcome John Knox with me, because what a message he has for all of you.
[03:34:25.274 --> 03:34:26.715]  And also his courage.
[03:34:26.715 --> 03:34:29.196]  I think you'll be moved by his courage as well.
[03:34:29.196 --> 03:34:31.157]  Karen Kingston's courage, too.
[03:34:31.157 --> 03:34:33.118]  Everyone's got this courage.
[03:34:33.118 --> 03:34:36.959]  And now, if we all displayed that courage, how amazing this could be.
[03:34:36.959 --> 03:34:40.861]  And we could really change, really turn the tide, if you will.
[03:34:41.308 --> 03:34:42.910]  This is what it's all about.
[03:34:42.910 --> 03:34:46.333]  It's turning the tide and getting the momentum behind us.
[03:34:46.333 --> 03:34:50.517]  And so it's really important to be able to hear from people like John Knox.
[03:34:50.517 --> 03:34:51.277]  John, are you with me?
[03:34:51.277 --> 03:34:53.159]  I am.
[03:34:53.159 --> 03:34:54.300]  How you doing?
[03:34:54.300 --> 03:34:55.241]  Oh, incredible.
[03:34:55.241 --> 03:34:56.002]  Thank you.
[03:34:56.002 --> 03:34:57.543]  I'm so glad you're joining me.
[03:34:57.543 --> 03:34:58.784]  What a voice you are.
[03:34:58.784 --> 03:35:04.650]  Tell us about the stand that the LAFD is taking and it's inspiring firefighters all over the country.
[03:35:07.395 --> 03:35:31.952]  Well, a couple weeks ago we had our city council that mandated, that put a mandate into effect, that basically if we did not get the shot or get vaccinated by September 30th, I believe it is, that we would be terminated or had the possibility of being terminated.
[03:35:31.952 --> 03:35:35.654]  So that started raising a lot of questions.
[03:35:37.592 --> 03:35:46.761]  throughout the department because again, not everybody is vaccinated or has taken the shot and not everybody wants to.
[03:35:46.761 --> 03:35:57.411]  And so there was a union meeting that took place about a week ago, maybe a little less than that.
[03:35:57.411 --> 03:36:00.554]  And during that union meeting, it was very
[03:36:03.328 --> 03:36:03.448]  Okay.
[03:36:34.131 --> 03:36:42.377]  And so, throughout this, there was a lot of questions being asked, and there was really not a whole lot of answers being given at that time.
[03:36:42.377 --> 03:36:59.289]  And I understand that our union, again, is, you know, supposed to be working with us, but the questions that were being raised were questions like, what do we do?
[03:36:59.289 --> 03:37:02.511]  I have a family to support, you know, my wife and my kids.
[03:37:03.437 --> 03:37:04.958]  What happens?
[03:37:04.958 --> 03:37:06.519]  Are you guys negotiating?
[03:37:06.519 --> 03:37:15.466]  Is there... And I understand where they're coming from, from the standpoint that they have a negotiating process they have to go through.
[03:37:15.466 --> 03:37:24.872]  But for me, I wasn't... I'm not going to sit and let them count on that.
[03:37:24.872 --> 03:37:26.273]  So I took a stand.
[03:37:26.273 --> 03:37:32.598]  And for me, planting my flag, drawing a line in the sand, stating that I will not get
[03:37:33.357 --> 03:37:40.422]  A shot or get vaccinated and that's my personal choice.
[03:37:40.422 --> 03:37:42.723]  I don't need to wear a mask.
[03:37:42.723 --> 03:37:46.346]  I don't need to test if I'm not sick.
[03:37:46.346 --> 03:37:49.568]  These are issues that we don't test.
[03:37:49.568 --> 03:37:55.732]  Non sick people we don't quarantine the healthy and there's a ton of evidence.
[03:37:55.732 --> 03:38:02.097]  As far as mask and so on and so forth that go along the lines, I mean of
[03:38:05.160 --> 03:38:07.362]  Our health issues as firefighters.
[03:38:07.362 --> 03:38:15.788]  So anyway, to make a longer story short, I basically stood up because there was a lot of questions and a lot of fear.
[03:38:15.788 --> 03:38:19.471]  What I felt in that room was fear and nobody really knew what to do.
[03:38:19.471 --> 03:38:25.395]  So when I stood up, I made it a point to say, you know, you're the city will have to terminate me.
[03:38:28.280 --> 03:38:32.622]  Because I will not go and get that shot voluntarily.
[03:38:32.622 --> 03:38:36.843]  And I will continue to come to work as long as I am healthy.
[03:38:36.843 --> 03:38:42.846]  And no mandate that you put into effect is going to affect me in that way.
[03:38:42.846 --> 03:38:43.326]  Right.
[03:38:43.326 --> 03:38:46.887]  Because those mandates are unconstitutional.
[03:38:46.887 --> 03:38:52.569]  No bureaucratic agency, no federal government is not doing this.
[03:38:52.569 --> 03:38:56.671]  They've pushed it off to the local agencies and small business.
[03:38:57.779 --> 03:39:07.007]  And so, you know, we have constitutional rights, we have states' rights, we have civil liberties that are being violated right now that
[03:39:08.649 --> 03:39:14.713]  People are not wrapping their head around this is not a vaccinated versus unvaccinated.
[03:39:14.713 --> 03:39:19.136]  This is not a left versus the right issue standing up for here.
[03:39:19.136 --> 03:39:29.243]  What our group firefighters for freedom stands for is the right to choose is the right as a sovereign individual of the United States of America.
[03:39:29.243 --> 03:39:30.644]  We're citizens.
[03:39:30.644 --> 03:39:33.506]  We have very specific rights.
[03:39:33.506 --> 03:39:38.349]  And so by you putting a mandate into effect and I mean, there's a
[03:39:38.909 --> 03:39:48.931]  I have a ton of issues with that, but you don't have a right to say what I put into my body or manage my health.
[03:39:48.931 --> 03:39:50.152]  Absolutely, body autonomy.
[03:39:50.152 --> 03:39:53.032]  Body autonomy, that is a basic freedom.
[03:39:53.032 --> 03:39:55.873]  If we lose that, we lose it all.
[03:39:55.873 --> 03:39:59.674]  I can't imagine that people can't get this.
[03:39:59.674 --> 03:40:05.675]  Yeah, it's a very simple concept, you know, and we're on a very slippery slope here in the United States right now.
[03:40:05.675 --> 03:40:08.216]  I mean, the world is looking to us
[03:40:09.159 --> 03:40:13.941]  Right now, you know, Australia, they're a disaster.
[03:40:13.941 --> 03:40:15.422]  Canada is a disaster.
[03:40:15.422 --> 03:40:18.903]  Europe's having the same problem, and everybody's looking to us.
[03:40:18.903 --> 03:40:20.444]  You know, we have the Constitution.
[03:40:20.444 --> 03:40:27.126]  We have strength in numbers, and there are so many people that believe the same thing.
[03:40:27.126 --> 03:40:33.689]  And even if you are on the vaccinated side, again, this is not a Vax vs. Unvax.
[03:40:33.689 --> 03:40:38.011]  At some point, if this does not go through and
[03:40:38.433 --> 03:40:49.459]  And this does not win the fact that, you know, my body, my choice, then the person that believes this mandate is correct.
[03:40:49.459 --> 03:40:58.183]  Somewhere down the line, there's going to be a mandate in the next 18 months that is going to violate one of their beliefs.
[03:40:58.183 --> 03:41:01.885]  And then you're not going to have a leg to stand on whatsoever.
[03:41:01.885 --> 03:41:08.048]  Because at that point, you've already rolled over and submitted to their authority, to their tyranny and said, yes,
[03:41:09.252 --> 03:41:14.937]  Go ahead, make these mandates, and you decide for me what is right.
[03:41:14.937 --> 03:41:16.037]  And that's not okay.
[03:41:16.037 --> 03:41:18.059]  That's a great point.
[03:41:18.059 --> 03:41:24.204]  You know, even the data shores up the very basic components of what you're talking about.
[03:41:24.204 --> 03:41:29.288]  So, whether people wear masks or not, never mattered, it didn't do a thing.
[03:41:29.288 --> 03:41:35.213]  I mean, honestly, all of the points that they're trying to bring up are not backed by data anyway.
[03:41:35.213 --> 03:41:36.454]  But what you're talking about is
[03:41:37.045 --> 03:41:39.466]  The basic right to body autonomy.
[03:41:39.466 --> 03:41:44.507]  They cannot force you to take a shot, because I guarantee you, there's 300 more shots.
[03:41:44.507 --> 03:41:51.909]  And so, I'm not quite sure how people come to the conclusion that this is okay for the safety of man.
[03:41:51.909 --> 03:42:03.012]  This has nothing to do with that, and it was, what, under 0.1% that were even clarified, or even, I say that loosely, designated as COVID.
[03:42:03.829 --> 03:42:10.152]  Deaths and I cannot understand why people think this is something that people have to do.
[03:42:10.152 --> 03:42:11.593]  You are right to fight this.
[03:42:11.593 --> 03:42:17.056]  I love and my hat tip, big hat tip to all of the firefighters that are fighting this too.
[03:42:17.056 --> 03:42:19.177]  And when I come back with John, I have more to say.
[03:42:19.608 --> 03:42:24.533]  I know you have more to say about body autonomy, about standing up as a basic American.
[03:42:24.533 --> 03:42:30.459]  When you said, plant your flag, all I kept thinking of was that iconic image of planting the flag.
[03:42:30.459 --> 03:42:37.747]  You have to plant the flag in your own life and come to terms with the fact that if you're not in this fight, you are on the wrong side of the fight.
[03:42:38.126 --> 03:42:40.007]  So you need to be in on this.
[03:42:40.007 --> 03:42:41.587]  And I'm going to come right back with John.
[03:42:41.587 --> 03:42:45.868]  You're listening to... I'm your guest host, Kate Dally, of The Kate Dally Show.

[03:42:55.471 --> 03:42:56.031]  Be right back.
[03:42:56.031 --> 03:43:01.032]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.

[03:47:00.256 --> 03:47:18.890]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:18.890 --> 03:47:24.834]  Back here with you, I'm Kate Dally, your guest host today from The Kate Dally Show, and I'm so glad to be here with you.
[03:47:24.834 --> 03:47:29.738]  Two very important guests, Karen Kingston with breaking news about the ingredients
[03:47:30.106 --> 03:47:31.587]  Of the Moderna patent.
[03:47:31.587 --> 03:47:33.429]  This is huge news.
[03:47:33.429 --> 03:47:37.812]  And one of the reasons, one of the absolute reasons to take a stand.
[03:47:37.812 --> 03:47:44.317]  My guest right now is John Knox from the Los Angeles Fire Department, firefighter, paramedic.
[03:47:44.317 --> 03:47:50.101]  And they are taking a hard and inspiring stand against this county mandate.
[03:47:50.101 --> 03:47:51.562]  There's a lot of county employees.
[03:47:51.562 --> 03:47:52.683]  There's a lot of hospitals.
[03:47:52.683 --> 03:47:56.666]  There's a lot of schools that are forcing this on their employees.
[03:47:56.666 --> 03:47:58.307]  And a lot of different industries are too.
[03:47:58.871 --> 03:48:19.685]  And you know, we were, John and I were talking about this previously, and I think one of the problems, John, is that those that are sitting back and going along to get along are doing it to preserve their home, to preserve their family, soccer, you know, soccer and the cost of all the different little, different games all the kids are in and maintain their life.
[03:48:19.685 --> 03:48:20.426]  The problem is,
[03:48:21.007 --> 03:48:26.592]  Is that they're actually going to lose all of that in the end if we are forced to do this.
[03:48:26.592 --> 03:48:31.395]  If we lose body autonomy and property rights, we really do cease to be Americans.
[03:48:31.395 --> 03:48:35.839]  And this is something that I know you guys get, the firefighters get.
[03:48:35.839 --> 03:48:42.504]  We understand that you guys understand this and you're trying to let people know that you are taking a stand for them.
[03:48:42.504 --> 03:48:49.550]  Because as much as we're trying to preserve every nook and cranny of our lives so we're not disturbed, we're about to lose everything.
[03:48:49.550 --> 03:48:50.611]  And I mean everything.
[03:48:50.981 --> 03:48:53.403]  Did you want to comment on that?
[03:48:53.403 --> 03:48:56.825]  Yeah, that's really important.
[03:48:56.825 --> 03:49:08.153]  And for a long time, you know, people, 10, 15 years, I don't know how many conversations you have, but people ask the same question, you know, what's going on in this country?
[03:49:08.153 --> 03:49:09.294]  When is this going to stop?
[03:49:09.294 --> 03:49:11.595]  The insanity, the madness, it's going down a rat hole.
[03:49:11.595 --> 03:49:18.600]  Whatever it is, people, you know, are fed up, but nobody has ever really, they're like, I don't understand.
[03:49:18.600 --> 03:49:19.681]  When are things going to change?
[03:49:20.612 --> 03:49:28.557]  And to me, this is, and this is I guess pun intended, but shock that's heard around the world.
[03:49:28.557 --> 03:49:40.065]  You know, this is the next American revolution from the standpoint that we as a society have been so quiet and timid and asleep at the wheel.
[03:49:40.065 --> 03:49:43.507]  And now is the time to take that stand.
[03:49:43.507 --> 03:49:44.608]  Is it uncomfortable?
[03:49:44.608 --> 03:49:45.809]  Yes.
[03:49:45.809 --> 03:49:49.091]  Do I want to lose my job, my career?
[03:49:50.586 --> 03:49:52.447]  Absolutely not.
[03:49:52.447 --> 03:50:05.630]  But at the same time, if I don't stand up for this, my children, my grandchildren, and everyone else will end up being slaves.
[03:50:05.630 --> 03:50:08.531]  Because this is pure insanity.
[03:50:08.531 --> 03:50:14.373]  We're literally losing, we're not losing them, we're just giving them up our constitutional rights.
[03:50:15.086 --> 03:50:26.029]  You know, we have the Declaration of Independence, we have the Constitution, and we have the Bill of Rights, and those things were penned and put together for very specific reasons.
[03:50:26.029 --> 03:50:40.153]  They give, they allow, those documents allow the government, it gives them consent to govern us, not to rule us, and that is what is happening.
[03:50:40.746 --> 03:50:45.731]  Literally, as everyone's been asleep, we're losing, you know, amendments, freedoms.
[03:50:45.731 --> 03:50:48.413]  First, Fourth, Fourteenth Amendment.
[03:50:48.413 --> 03:50:49.694]  Those are huge.
[03:50:49.694 --> 03:50:53.498]  That's your right to, you know, the First Amendment.
[03:50:53.498 --> 03:51:00.504]  Religion, freedom of speech, freedom of press, peaceably assemble.
[03:51:00.504 --> 03:51:06.190]  Tell me during COVID in the past 18 months that we went from total normal society to
[03:51:07.466 --> 03:51:09.087]  Where we are right now.
[03:51:09.087 --> 03:51:11.527]  And it was 10 days to flatten the curve.
[03:51:11.527 --> 03:51:15.749]  And then it was stay in your home, you know, for six months.
[03:51:15.749 --> 03:51:19.530]  And then it was if you get the shot, life will go back to normal.
[03:51:19.530 --> 03:51:21.651]  And then it's now you're going to need a booster.
[03:51:21.651 --> 03:51:24.252]  And then it's we're going back into lockdowns.
[03:51:24.252 --> 03:51:27.593]  You can't go into, you know, in California.
[03:51:27.593 --> 03:51:29.253]  They're trying to pass right now.
[03:51:29.253 --> 03:51:34.475]  You cannot go into any indoor establishment if
[03:51:35.658 --> 03:51:39.580]  You have not been vaccinated and don't have your card.
[03:51:39.580 --> 03:51:41.201]  And that's insanity.
[03:51:41.201 --> 03:51:46.985]  I mean, think about during COVID.
[03:51:46.985 --> 03:51:57.471]  If you're a Christian or a Muslim, whatever, your church, your synagogue, your temple was closed, yet liquor stores were open.
[03:51:58.504 --> 03:52:03.226]  Now, last time I checked, the First Amendment protects religious freedom.
[03:52:03.226 --> 03:52:08.348]  Not liquor stores, not Home Depot, not Costco, not any of that stuff.
[03:52:08.348 --> 03:52:12.810]  But I couldn't go and worship in my church.
[03:52:12.810 --> 03:52:17.052]  I wasn't allowed to leave my home or go assemble, peaceably assemble.
[03:52:17.052 --> 03:52:19.112]  That's part of the First Amendment as well.
[03:52:19.112 --> 03:52:21.973]  So, freedom of press.
[03:52:21.973 --> 03:52:22.374]  Here we go.
[03:52:23.996 --> 03:52:24.216]  Right.
[03:52:24.216 --> 03:52:26.237]  We don't have channels to speak out.
[03:52:26.237 --> 03:52:31.441]  As soon as you speak out about these issues, you're literally cancelled.
[03:52:31.441 --> 03:52:32.641]  We have cancel culture.
[03:52:32.641 --> 03:52:41.687]  We have, you know, big Facebook, all these other entities that are telling you what you can and can't say.
[03:52:41.687 --> 03:52:44.248]  Everything you post is false.
[03:52:44.248 --> 03:52:49.351]  It's fact-checked by mysterious little gnomes somewhere, you know?
[03:52:49.351 --> 03:52:50.352]  The powers that be.
[03:52:51.710 --> 03:52:53.231]  Right.
[03:52:53.231 --> 03:52:54.451]  It's communist.
[03:52:54.451 --> 03:52:57.612]  It really, truly is, if people would realize what we're being fact-checked by.
[03:52:57.612 --> 03:53:00.633]  And, you know, like, you know, the feds could not pass this, right?
[03:53:00.633 --> 03:53:02.074]  They couldn't get away with it.
[03:53:02.074 --> 03:53:09.716]  So they're leaning on counties and states to try to do this, and industries that are bought in by pharma to try to do the bidding for them.
[03:53:09.716 --> 03:53:12.337]  And this is why it's crucial that we take a stand.
[03:53:12.337 --> 03:53:14.438]  And I'm so proud of the LAFD.
[03:53:15.123 --> 03:53:19.566]  And taking the stand and saying absolutely no, not on our watch.
[03:53:19.566 --> 03:53:23.688]  And you have a lot of guys in on this too that are saying absolutely no, right?
[03:53:23.688 --> 03:53:25.930]  A lot of support.
[03:53:25.930 --> 03:53:26.390]  We do.
[03:53:26.390 --> 03:53:29.672]  We have a lot of support.
[03:53:29.672 --> 03:53:30.973]  We've hired an attorney.
[03:53:30.973 --> 03:53:34.915]  We have a ton of support within our department.
[03:53:34.915 --> 03:53:40.218]  You know, I understand that people are scared, but that's normal.
[03:53:40.218 --> 03:53:41.239]  Yet at the same time,
[03:53:43.019 --> 03:54:01.670]  The time has come for people to stop being scared, to embrace the rights that you were not only given by our Creator, but that made this country the greatest country in the world, that allowed us freedoms that no one else has had.
[03:54:01.670 --> 03:54:06.572]  And we are losing those, and we will continue to lose those at an exponential speed.
[03:54:08.499 --> 03:54:13.681]  That people, I mean, in 18 months, you're not going to realize what this country looks like.
[03:54:13.681 --> 03:54:14.941]  And that's terrifying.
[03:54:14.941 --> 03:54:18.382]  And to me, that's why I'm taking a stand.
[03:54:18.382 --> 03:54:27.185]  And that's why I'm asking everyone, this literally has nothing to do or stand with whether you believe in the vaccination or not.
[03:54:27.185 --> 03:54:29.046]  This is truly about
[03:54:29.858 --> 03:54:40.087]  Your right to choose to be free in this country and not be mandated by some bureaucracy or elected official that we put there.
[03:54:40.087 --> 03:54:47.774]  They do not have to tell me what to do to mandate my health care and so on.
[03:54:47.774 --> 03:54:49.375]  And so that's what we're standing for.
[03:54:49.375 --> 03:54:56.782]  And I'm asking everyone that's watching this, get together with your unions, with your
[03:54:57.873 --> 03:55:03.517]  With your co-workers, with anybody, because this is the time to stand.
[03:55:03.517 --> 03:55:05.259]  And you know what?
[03:55:05.259 --> 03:55:09.922]  Doing the job that I do, I have this platform and I'm going to use it.
[03:55:09.922 --> 03:55:11.623]  And I will be vocal.
[03:55:11.623 --> 03:55:13.345]  I will not lie down.
[03:55:13.345 --> 03:55:18.148]  I will not submit to this tyranny.
[03:55:18.148 --> 03:55:19.169]  How can people help you?
[03:55:19.169 --> 03:55:20.590]  You guys have hired attorneys.
[03:55:20.590 --> 03:55:22.792]  You need monetary help.
[03:55:22.792 --> 03:55:24.633]  Help these guys get the attorneys.
[03:55:25.243 --> 03:55:25.664]  I don't know.
[03:55:42.109 --> 03:55:42.909]  For truth.
[03:55:42.909 --> 03:55:43.609]  And you're right.
[03:55:43.609 --> 03:55:46.610]  This is all about the force of the shot.
[03:55:46.610 --> 03:55:56.872]  And people that are vaccinated and people that are unvaccinated all need to come together to fight for the very right to not be forced to have an injection placed into your body.
[03:55:56.872 --> 03:55:58.273]  Can you imagine our kids?
[03:55:58.273 --> 03:56:00.173]  How many shots are they going to be up against?
[03:56:00.173 --> 03:56:02.094]  You know, a thousand shots in their lifetime.
[03:56:02.094 --> 03:56:03.034]  Who knows?
[03:56:03.034 --> 03:56:05.514]  I don't know what they have in store, but this is scary stuff.
[03:56:05.514 --> 03:56:06.855]  And I love that you're taking a stand.
[03:56:06.855 --> 03:56:07.775]  Can you give us the website?
[03:56:09.176 --> 03:56:12.337]  Our website was just put up, so bear with us.
[03:56:12.337 --> 03:56:19.559]  It's still a work in progress, but it is firefighters4freedom.org.
[03:56:19.559 --> 03:56:21.460]  And that 4 is the number 4.
[03:56:21.460 --> 03:56:25.921]  So, firefighters4freedom.org.
[03:56:25.921 --> 03:56:26.841]  And you can go there.
[03:56:26.841 --> 03:56:28.622]  There's donate buttons there.
[03:56:28.622 --> 03:56:33.443]  You can also donate on GiveSendGo.
[03:56:34.241 --> 03:56:43.225]  If you go to GiveSendGo.com, you can also look up Firefighters for Freedom there, and it will allow you to donate there.
[03:56:43.225 --> 03:56:48.268]  There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of firefighters, right, behind this.
[03:56:48.268 --> 03:56:53.230]  People do not realize how many people are standing in this and saying, we will stand too.
[03:56:54.383 --> 03:56:58.487]  Yeah, and we need everybody and not just public employees.
[03:56:58.487 --> 03:57:05.955]  This is literally a constitutional issue that everyone in this country will benefit from in the long run.
[03:57:05.955 --> 03:57:08.838]  If we lose at this, it's game over.
[03:57:08.838 --> 03:57:14.464]  And so I beg everyone to please come stand with us.
[03:57:15.666 --> 03:57:20.850]  You know, hearing you speak, John, of the LAFD, I was getting a little teary.
[03:57:20.850 --> 03:57:24.833]  We don't realize that we're on the cusp of losing the entire country, all of our freedoms.
[03:57:24.833 --> 03:57:32.539]  I thank you for coming on, John Knox, LAFD, more power to the LAFD, for taking this stand, and I hope hundreds more join you.
[03:57:32.539 --> 03:57:34.040]  Thank you so much.
[03:57:34.040 --> 03:57:34.760]  Really appreciate you.
[03:57:34.760 --> 03:57:35.681]  Thank you.
[03:57:35.681 --> 03:57:36.482]  I really appreciate it.
[03:57:36.482 --> 03:57:36.782]  Thank you.
[03:57:37.944 --> 03:57:38.584]  Thank you.
[03:57:38.584 --> 03:57:41.225]  Go to katedallyradio.com for more on this.
[03:57:41.225 --> 03:57:45.966]  John and I will be discussing this on my show, and you can click listen live from anywhere in the country.
[03:57:45.966 --> 03:57:46.386]  Bye.
[03:57:46.386 --> 03:57:51.788]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action, and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[03:57:51.788 --> 03:58:01.170]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly, and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[03:58:01.810 --> 03:58:11.756]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[03:58:11.756 --> 03:58:18.541]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening, and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
