[00:00.000 --> 00:29.400]  we are truly tomorrow's news today it was Friday that we began to report
[00:29.400 --> 00:35.520]  that Japan was pulling millions and millions of injections or doses of
[00:35.520 --> 00:41.600]  Moderna's mRNA gene therapy injection because they were finding liquid
[00:41.600 --> 00:47.520]  magnetic nanoparticles that have been made industrially in all of the shots
[00:47.520 --> 00:56.160]  and these were made by Moderna which is DARPA and Bill Gates in Madrid Spain it
[00:56.160 --> 01:00.160]  looks like they added more metal than they were supposed to because it started
[01:00.160 --> 01:04.520]  killing a bunch of people and then the Japanese government at first tried to
[01:04.520 --> 01:07.120]  cover it up that it was so big they couldn't this has been happening the
[01:07.120 --> 01:10.800]  last few weeks so they pulled them in Tokyo they pulled them in a bunch of
[01:10.800 --> 01:16.240]  other cities and found that basically all of the doses that they tested and
[01:16.240 --> 01:21.680]  looked at have the metallic systems added to it now we started telling
[01:21.680 --> 01:25.560]  everybody when they started the injections in England that people were
[01:25.560 --> 01:30.600]  complaining of becoming magnetic and then you saw it demonstrated by medical
[01:30.600 --> 01:36.200]  doctors in Mexico and Italy and the US and Canada and Germany well now it's in
[01:36.200 --> 01:40.560]  Reuters so it's not in the big Tokyo newspaper like it was last week it's
[01:40.560 --> 01:45.760]  not in the Okinawa newspaper people just ignored that and said oh no it's fake
[01:45.760 --> 01:50.480]  news you try to post it on Twitter they would remove it you're not allowed to
[01:50.480 --> 01:58.000]  warn the people well now it's in Reuters it's in the associated press and they
[01:58.000 --> 02:05.720]  just don't know what to do here's some of the headlines Japan halts 2.6
[02:05.720 --> 02:10.360]  million Moderna doses after additional vials found to contain foreign substances
[02:10.360 --> 02:14.840]  an extra two men die and when you read the actual Japanese local articles
[02:14.840 --> 02:22.120]  there's deaths in every town from this and yes they're magnetic continuing
[02:22.120 --> 02:27.480]  here's Reuters contaminant in Moderna vaccine suspected to be metallic
[02:27.480 --> 02:32.040]  particles and that's the national government coming out and saying that
[02:32.040 --> 02:37.080]  you try to put this on Twitter they're even removing Reuters because they
[02:37.080 --> 02:40.840]  they're a depopulation movement they're a cult and I'm gonna show you where they
[02:40.840 --> 02:45.120]  brag about that in a moment so Facebook all of them are embedded their
[02:45.120 --> 02:49.760]  Zuckerberg's invested in the Wuhan lab they are all part of this criminal
[02:49.760 --> 02:53.800]  assault they believe to save the earth by depopulating us and if we don't stand
[02:53.800 --> 02:57.720]  up to them we kind of deserve it don't we contaminants and Moderna vaccines
[02:57.720 --> 03:05.160]  suspected to be metallic articles in HK Reuters so put that in your pipe ladies
[03:05.160 --> 03:11.520]  and gentlemen and smoke it and show that to all the detractors out there here's
[03:11.520 --> 03:16.760]  another one Moderna vaccine production continues in EU amid contamination probe
[03:16.760 --> 03:20.520]  Reuters and they're still injecting people with it all over the world with
[03:20.520 --> 03:25.300]  Japanese government says no no no here's another headline people got
[03:25.300 --> 03:28.640]  suspended from Twitter a few months ago for saying that it had medical
[03:28.640 --> 03:36.440]  particles in it suspended permanently hate to say it but the seed man was right
[03:36.440 --> 03:41.760]  again Alex Jones whatever that means that's all over Twitter and Facebook
[03:41.760 --> 03:44.360]  everywhere Alex Jones is right Alex Jones is right it's like spray painted
[03:44.360 --> 03:48.560]  all over the country they really don't like that do they
[03:48.560 --> 03:54.080]  meanwhile they did not approve the Moderna and COVID injections they did
[03:54.080 --> 03:58.880]  not improve the Pfizer they simply said we're reauthorizing its emergency
[03:58.880 --> 04:07.760]  authorization will release studies in 2025 maybe but everyone's saying oh it's
[04:07.760 --> 04:10.520]  totally tested it's totally safe that's what the Pentagon's moving forward
[04:10.520 --> 04:14.880]  against the troops with it this is an assault the Pentagon's run by globalist
[04:14.880 --> 04:19.200]  that are destroying the country do you understand just like the French fell in
[04:19.200 --> 04:24.360]  two weeks to the Germans when the French fought the Germans and lost the most
[04:24.360 --> 04:30.040]  troops in World War one but beat them and it's because they bought off 90% of
[04:30.040 --> 04:37.880]  the high command Hitler did so that the French military stood down and that's
[04:37.880 --> 04:40.960]  why they move the capital of France to Vici France in the south that's
[04:40.960 --> 04:45.480]  historical it's the same thing here the globalist bought off our military and
[04:45.480 --> 04:50.000]  the intelligence agencies and they're now carrying out bio warfare on us for
[04:50.000 --> 04:56.960]  China that's a fact and Congress is too stupid to figure it out

[06:27.880 --> 06:42.000]  which I'm certain I've lived a life that's full I traveled each and every high
[06:42.000 --> 06:49.640]  ladies and gentlemen we are live it's August 31st 2021 on this Tuesday
[06:49.640 --> 06:59.440]  broadcast thank you blue eyes for bringing us in well it's all out the
[06:59.440 --> 07:03.800]  open now isn't it all the games are over you're gonna see the globalist attack
[07:03.800 --> 07:09.680]  plan that I've been so desperate to stop now they've launched it now would you
[07:09.680 --> 07:14.960]  like to know what's coming next if people will just simply listen to me and
[07:14.960 --> 07:18.800]  check the documents we can stop them it's all run by the Rockefeller Foundation
[07:18.800 --> 07:27.000]  through Bill Gates it is a planned operation and they are doing it their
[07:27.000 --> 07:32.200]  way and it's time for us to realize that and become aware of the type of new
[07:32.200 --> 07:37.200]  war we're in or we have no future and maybe you don't arise the challenge
[07:37.200 --> 07:42.200]  maybe you want to roll over and die but as for me I'm not gonna roll over and
[07:42.200 --> 07:45.520]  die I'm gonna stop the globalist with God's help in your help we're gonna do
[07:45.520 --> 07:53.800]  it together all right let me let me just hit it for you right now they have to
[07:53.800 --> 07:57.440]  kill us under their globalist plan for their God they believe they're about to
[07:57.440 --> 08:00.760]  get live extensioning technologies and there's too many of us and that's their
[08:00.760 --> 08:06.360]  operation it's the perfect excuse for them to play God and there gets to a
[08:06.360 --> 08:10.080]  point where you can't just do to ski experiments over here and radiation
[08:10.080 --> 08:14.360]  experiments there and kill a few thousand here a few thousand there or have a war
[08:14.360 --> 08:18.600]  and kill a few million here a few million there you really want to be
[08:18.600 --> 08:23.600]  populate you've got to go ahead and release a bio weapon with plausible
[08:23.600 --> 08:30.200]  deniability and then have the response to the bio weapon be a binary system that
[08:30.200 --> 08:33.240]  connects with the virus and then basically starts wiping people out in
[08:33.240 --> 08:37.080]  mass then you blame the unvaccinated despite all the statistics showing it
[08:37.080 --> 08:43.400]  is the vaccinated and a large enough percentage of the public will not be
[08:43.400 --> 08:46.600]  able to admit that the social contract is broken and that the globalist are at
[08:46.600 --> 08:52.600]  war with them and they will then turn against their fellow humans and ally
[08:52.600 --> 08:56.720]  themselves with the establishment believing that the prosperity will just
[08:56.720 --> 09:01.960]  come back if they simply submit to the globalist program even though
[09:01.960 --> 09:10.280]  claus Schwab and Boris Johnson and Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and
[09:10.280 --> 09:18.280]  Merkel and all the former and current puppets are all calling for a post
[09:18.280 --> 09:24.000]  industrial world global carbon tax and are now saying the lockdowns of COVID
[09:24.000 --> 09:30.000]  were just a test now we're gonna lock you down for the climate there's a new
[09:30.000 --> 09:40.000]  Justin Trudeau video of him saying what we did with COVID is a model here it is
[09:40.000 --> 09:44.480]  there's a quote what we learned from COVID crisis will be applying to the
[09:44.480 --> 09:49.480]  climate crisis to the housing crisis which they triggered to the
[09:49.480 --> 09:54.240]  reconciliation to making sure everybody has good jobs they destroy your
[09:54.240 --> 09:59.520]  economy and then bring in the controls of the universal income and here he is
[09:59.520 --> 10:04.760]  here he also announces bank accounts frozen if people don't get vaccinated
[10:04.760 --> 10:12.200]  and sign up for the 1984 surveillance app and that's what's coming here being
[10:12.200 --> 10:16.080]  implemented through the corporations through the hotel chains through open
[10:16.080 --> 10:21.480]  table through all of it and of course they now announce fouchy ounce yesterday
[10:21.480 --> 10:26.360]  the Australians announced yesterday the UN announced yesterday you're gonna get
[10:26.360 --> 10:34.400]  shots every five to six months on a digital app the UN has released the new
[10:34.400 --> 10:39.600]  program for the UN approved world government app run by the Rockefeller
[10:39.600 --> 10:47.280]  Foundation and Bill and the Gates Foundation it actually says it who has
[10:47.280 --> 10:52.640]  published the guidance document for countries implementing partners on the
[10:52.640 --> 10:58.360]  introduction of digital vaccine certificates dubbed DDCCVS the work was
[10:58.360 --> 11:00.720]  funded by the Bill and the Gates Foundation and the Rockefeller
[11:00.720 --> 11:06.360]  Foundation amongst others and I'm gonna show you the document here today and for
[11:06.360 --> 11:09.080]  all those years ago I said the Rockefeller Foundation runs at all and
[11:09.080 --> 11:14.160]  now they officially run the global response of the UN the US and everybody
[11:14.160 --> 11:22.560]  else to how everything's done and the plan of the Rockefeller Foundation has
[11:22.560 --> 11:32.280]  been and is depopulation basically the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute was founded by
[11:32.280 --> 11:39.720]  a twenty five million dollar grant more than a hundred years ago by the
[11:39.720 --> 11:43.440]  Cold Springs Harbor Rockefeller Foundation you don't know what Cold
[11:43.440 --> 11:49.920]  Springs Harbor is you might want to find out but Hitler was birthed by the
[11:49.920 --> 11:56.240]  Rockefellers the UN came out from between the legs of the Rockefellers the
[11:56.240 --> 12:01.040]  IMF the World Bank everything you see
[12:02.040 --> 12:06.600]  John D. the first
[12:07.800 --> 12:14.720]  a vowed Luciferian on record
[12:14.720 --> 12:28.280]  working for the devil overtime it's his world it's his way I want to go to an
[12:28.280 --> 12:35.440]  extremely important Gregory's report Pfizer demanded military bases as
[12:35.440 --> 12:46.800]  collateral for cost of vaccine deaths but you didn't know that here it is a
[12:46.800 --> 12:53.240]  story from this spring is reemerging of why Argentina and Brazil never made a
[12:53.240 --> 12:59.360]  deal with Pfizer for the experimental jab in Argentina Pfizer requested that the
[12:59.360 --> 13:04.280]  government pay all compensation for any lawsuits that successfully win against
[13:04.280 --> 13:09.880]  Pfizer vaccine damages Argentina's Parliament responded by passing a new
[13:09.880 --> 13:15.440]  law stating that Pfizer needs to at least pay for its own negligence Pfizer
[13:15.440 --> 13:20.560]  rejected this after which Argentina offered to amend the law to define
[13:20.560 --> 13:26.560]  negligence more clearly to include only vaccine distribution and delivery under
[13:26.560 --> 13:31.560]  negligence but Pfizer still wasn't happy and demanded the law be changed
[13:31.560 --> 13:37.960]  Argentina refused but later agreed to buy an international insurance policy to
[13:37.960 --> 13:43.800]  pay for future vaccine lawsuits this was not specific enough for Pfizer they
[13:43.800 --> 13:49.160]  asked for an additional indemnity from civil cases specifically that the
[13:49.160 --> 13:55.400]  company would not be held liable for rare adverse effects or for its own acts of
[13:55.400 --> 14:01.400]  negligence fraud or malice Pfizer then demanded the nation's bank reserves
[14:01.400 --> 14:06.400]  military bases and embassy buildings as some sort of collateral against future
[14:06.400 --> 14:12.880]  vaccine damages in Brazil Pfizer asked for vast money reserves to be put in a
[14:12.880 --> 14:17.320]  foreign bank account that Pfizer be exempt from the law of the land and
[14:17.320 --> 14:24.120]  exempt from any side effects and all civil liability in the United States the
[14:24.120 --> 14:30.120]  Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act or PREP Act gives total
[14:30.120 --> 14:35.680]  immunity to Pfizer and all manufacturers of experimental jabs so there's no
[14:35.680 --> 14:40.680]  reason to threaten any government agency in the US they always knew how
[14:40.680 --> 14:46.160]  dangerous and deadly the radical experimental mRNA jabs actually are
[14:46.160 --> 14:52.120]  it's what the science says the only ones who say otherwise are the bureaucrats
[14:52.120 --> 14:58.280]  and pop culture media agents working for Big Pharma by every measure this is the
[14:58.280 --> 15:04.040]  greatest crime committed by Big Pharma out of a long list their magnum opus
[15:04.040 --> 15:08.680]  for the dark arts death and depopulation and they were setting up
[15:08.680 --> 15:13.240]  governments to take the fall so that the bankers can have their great reset
[15:13.240 --> 15:24.720]  without any resistance for info wars calm this is Greg Reese all right folks
[15:24.720 --> 15:30.280]  you can find the report as the featured video at bandot video Pfizer demands
[15:30.280 --> 15:35.920]  military bases is collateral on cost of vaccine deaths it's all part of a
[15:35.920 --> 15:41.680]  systematic plan and they are now admitting publicly they're preparing
[15:41.680 --> 15:45.560]  the new climate lock mounds that's why they have the police beating and
[15:45.560 --> 15:51.280]  attacking everyone worldwide this is a savage sinister takeover designed to
[15:51.280 --> 15:54.920]  collapse the world economy and trigger mass starvation and death of billions

[20:32.120 --> 20:37.680]  friends I intend to open the phones up in the second hour today so that listeners
[20:37.680 --> 20:42.880]  can tell their stories about being in country in Afghanistan and what you
[20:42.880 --> 20:46.280]  think of the pullout and what's really behind it that's one area we're open the
[20:46.280 --> 20:50.320]  phones up on the other area is what you've seen with your friends your
[20:50.320 --> 20:55.440]  family your neighbors or co-workers with these so-called COVID vaccines and your
[20:55.440 --> 21:01.280]  eyewitness reports no one has called in yet to say they like the system nobody
[21:01.280 --> 21:14.680]  has called in yet to say that it was a great thing so that's all coming up
[21:14.680 --> 21:26.640]  here today in the second hour here on the Alex Jones show but let me just
[21:26.640 --> 21:33.240]  right now talk about solutions and things that are positive last year we
[21:33.240 --> 21:38.520]  looked at the statistics of the numbers the hospitals were basically empty they
[21:38.520 --> 21:42.080]  were saying people that died of gunshot wounds and car wrecks and regular flu
[21:42.080 --> 21:47.400]  and pneumonia and cancer and heart attacks as COVID I just reported the
[21:47.400 --> 21:52.120]  facts we had all sorts of investigative journalists on that went to hospitals
[21:52.120 --> 21:59.240]  around the world to show that indeed they were basically empty then starting
[21:59.240 --> 22:02.520]  about three and a half months ago I began to see a lot of people get really
[22:02.520 --> 22:05.840]  sick a lot of people have trouble breathing and a lot of people die at
[22:05.840 --> 22:10.600]  the hospital and in many cases they weren't even saying they had COVID they
[22:10.600 --> 22:14.040]  were saying that it was all these new weird quote viruses that had popped up
[22:14.040 --> 22:20.400]  clearly from the shedding and the medical literature actually shows all of
[22:20.400 --> 22:28.880]  that and so now the media spins it that oh Alex Jones you know as said COVID
[22:28.880 --> 22:33.080]  wasn't real and Alex Jones said it was all a hoax and now he's eating crow look
[22:33.080 --> 22:36.920]  there's all these deaths yay why look three conservative talk show hosts
[22:36.920 --> 22:43.480]  together our thousands of them have died and the young Turks everybody you
[22:43.480 --> 22:48.680]  know make jokes about it I've been saying for over three months that this is
[22:48.680 --> 22:53.480]  serious and this is real my family didn't test positive for COVID but they
[22:53.480 --> 22:57.520]  thought they had like a gorilla sitting on their chest and it sure fit all the
[22:57.520 --> 23:02.280]  symptoms and they lost their smell and almost everybody else I know has been
[23:02.280 --> 23:07.920]  sick and I know a lot of folks have died especially in Texas in Florida a lot of
[23:07.920 --> 23:11.800]  the insiders I talked to say that they're bombarding us specifically with
[23:11.800 --> 23:15.480]  nanoparticles in these states and that it isn't even COVID that's why it doesn't
[23:15.480 --> 23:23.200]  come up as COVID and the very same groups then work around the clock to
[23:23.200 --> 23:30.920]  suppress ivermectin, Regeneron and other treatments that are 100% if you
[23:30.920 --> 23:38.840]  catch somebody early I know no exaggeration 50 people that had a headache
[23:38.840 --> 23:43.840]  didn't have a chest cold and within two days thought again a giant gorilla was
[23:43.840 --> 23:46.720]  sitting on their chest they go to the hospital they wouldn't give them any
[23:46.720 --> 23:51.720]  help I got ahold of medical doctors and others got them prescriptions for
[23:51.720 --> 23:56.600]  ivermectin and all the rest of it and within a day of them taking it they all
[23:56.600 --> 24:00.320]  turned around and were better in a few days so I've experienced it and that's
[24:00.320 --> 24:04.840]  why I'm so angry now at the globalist because I didn't just hear about ivermectin
[24:04.840 --> 24:08.360]  or the Japanese government saying it works 100% or the whole history of it
[24:08.360 --> 24:13.200]  I've witnessed it for myself and I'm really angry now so let's save some
[24:13.200 --> 24:17.960]  lives let's warn some people let's take action now go to Bandod video and go to
[24:17.960 --> 24:22.360]  the John Bounds section we'll also post us the front page of info wars.com and
[24:22.360 --> 24:26.640]  share this video the vilification of ivermectin let's save some lives
[24:26.640 --> 24:32.400]  together here it is ivermectin is an early treatment drug with a high rate
[24:32.400 --> 24:39.280]  of effectiveness in studies against COVID-19 according to c19 ivermectin.com
[24:39.280 --> 24:46.640]  meta-analysis using the most serious outcome reported shows 72% and 86%
[24:46.640 --> 24:52.120]  improvement for early treatment and prophylaxis statistically significant
[24:52.120 --> 24:57.160]  improvements are seen for mortality, hospitalization, recovery, cases, and
[24:57.160 --> 25:02.720]  viral clearance. 27 studies show statistically significant improvements
[25:02.720 --> 25:07.880]  in isolation the probability that an ineffective treatment generated results
[25:07.880 --> 25:13.880]  as positive as the 63 studies is estimated to be 1 in 1 trillion like
[25:13.880 --> 25:19.720]  many drugs ivermectin comes in doses for human and animal consumption but
[25:19.720 --> 25:24.560]  according to the frontline COVID-19 critical care alliance for prevention
[25:24.560 --> 25:29.120]  and early treatment the amount of ivermectin taken is a tiny amount but
[25:29.120 --> 25:33.880]  as the vaccine industry stands to make billions more from a booster regime for
[25:33.880 --> 25:39.080]  the COVID boogie man that has a recovery rate on average of 99% and a
[25:39.080 --> 25:42.920]  media industry that feeds off the pharmaceutical industry with countless
[25:42.920 --> 25:47.200]  hours of advertising the propaganda against ivermectin has been
[25:47.200 --> 25:53.920]  unrelenting. Well a new false cure for COVID in high demand ivermectin a drug
[25:53.920 --> 26:00.240]  most commonly used to deworm large animals like horses is selling out with
[26:00.240 --> 26:05.040]  many people turning to a pro-trump telemedicine website with hopes to get
[26:05.040 --> 26:11.440]  it. An adult drank an injectable ivermectin formulation intended for
[26:11.440 --> 26:16.800]  use in cattle in an attempt to prevent COVID-19 infection this patient
[26:16.800 --> 26:21.600]  presented to a hospital with confusion drowsiness visual hallucinations
[26:21.600 --> 26:26.960]  tachypnea which is rapid breathing also tremors the patient recovered after
[26:26.960 --> 26:36.000]  being hospitalized for nine days nine days nine days in the hospital drinking
[26:36.000 --> 26:41.360]  injectable ivermectin formulated as an injection that you would shoot into a
[26:41.360 --> 26:45.280]  cow. I gotta say when i first heard that Fox News was pushing ivermectin i knew
[26:45.280 --> 26:49.360]  it was going to be bad but i was not expecting it to be horse dewormer
[26:49.360 --> 26:52.880]  sounds like the name of a drug they give super soldiers in a pulverhoven movie
[26:52.880 --> 26:55.760]  to turn them into robo cops you know someone at the company that made ivermectin
[26:55.760 --> 26:58.400]  once said hey should we put not for people on the horse pill labels and
[26:58.400 --> 27:02.720]  someone else said there's a picture of a horse on the bottle it's fine.
[27:02.720 --> 27:07.600]  Of course far from the slime permeated from television are doctors rather than
[27:07.600 --> 27:11.680]  failed late night talk show hosts presenting studies backed up by the
[27:11.680 --> 27:16.000]  threat of malpractice trials conducted across the developing world
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.880]  have also revealed ivermectin to be an effective treatment for COVID-19
[27:20.880 --> 27:25.120]  reducing symptoms cutting mortality by up to 75 percent.
[27:25.120 --> 27:29.120]  But as the virus mutates into more lethal strains and as
[27:29.120 --> 27:33.440]  concerns grow that vaccines alone may not be the long-term answer
[27:33.440 --> 27:37.520]  so interest is building in ivermectin with its potential
[27:37.520 --> 27:43.200]  to be both prevention and cure. So much so that researchers at Oxford
[27:43.200 --> 27:46.320]  University are conducting a trial of their own.
[27:46.320 --> 27:49.520]  Although we're hopeful that vaccines are going to do what's promised
[27:49.520 --> 27:53.200]  the data is not very reassuring that they're actually going to achieve
[27:53.200 --> 27:56.560]  everything that they're setting out to achieve but if they don't
[27:56.560 --> 28:01.040]  we'll have another tool as a backup and is one that we can deploy now
[28:01.040 --> 28:04.160]  while waiting for the vaccines right there there's huge portions of the world
[28:04.160 --> 28:06.880]  which don't have anything available to protect them or to treat them.
[28:06.880 --> 28:10.000]  From the perspective of the psychotic elite planners
[28:10.000 --> 28:14.000]  the great reset war on humanity using the COVID-19
[28:14.000 --> 28:18.080]  gain-of-function bio weapon to slowly reduce population
[28:18.080 --> 28:21.920]  must not be derailed. But they're trying to block
[28:21.920 --> 28:26.080]  vitamin D in the news vitamin C hydroxychloroquine now ivermectin.
[28:26.080 --> 28:31.760]  And there's another legal issue here that has not been properly looked at in
[28:31.760 --> 28:37.920]  the media which is they can't allow any effective treatments
[28:37.920 --> 28:45.360]  because the emergency measures the EU the emergency use
[28:45.360 --> 28:52.240]  authorization law says you cannot have the government
[28:52.240 --> 28:55.840]  doing the emergency authorizations if there are any
[28:55.840 --> 28:59.920]  any one effective treatment. Hey everybody confused about staying healthy
[28:59.920 --> 29:04.240]  in a crazy COVID culture? Me too. But listen after all the research
[29:04.240 --> 29:06.800]  all the conflicting studies after all the squabbling
[29:06.800 --> 29:11.120]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on it's that immune system health
[29:11.120 --> 29:13.920]  can literally be the difference between life and death.
[29:13.920 --> 29:17.760]  You probably already believe that. I certainly do. So here's the thing
[29:17.760 --> 29:22.080]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant based substances
[29:22.080 --> 29:26.720]  actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.

[32:09.360 --> 32:12.240]  The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing

[32:58.240 --> 33:09.760]  Thank you so much.
[33:09.760 --> 33:28.000]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones.
[33:28.000 --> 33:31.360]  So Bill Gates and the globalists say they want to depopulate us and we've got a
[33:31.360 --> 33:35.040]  bunch of big breaking news on that front next segment
[33:35.040 --> 33:38.240]  and they go and they buy up and get control of all the major national and
[33:38.240 --> 33:43.520]  local health departments of the world and then they roll out a virus to create
[33:43.520 --> 33:47.120]  fear. They create a biological therapy that actually
[33:47.120 --> 33:50.480]  makes people sick and lowers their immune system and because they own the
[33:50.480 --> 33:54.320]  big media and big tech they're able to suppress communications
[33:54.320 --> 33:57.600]  and try to keep the public from learning about the fact that they actually
[33:57.600 --> 34:01.760]  launched the attack themselves with the chai comms for global domination
[34:01.760 --> 34:05.360]  and they even wrote white papers at the Rockefeller Foundation called Operation
[34:05.360 --> 34:09.200]  Lockstep laying out the battle plan.
[34:09.200 --> 34:13.120]  But then out of Japan where they invented it for humans
[34:13.120 --> 34:15.600]  and out of Africa where most of the government's handed out to their
[34:15.600 --> 34:19.440]  population because they found it's also a great antiviral
[34:19.440 --> 34:24.960]  ivermectin emerges just like a droxychloroquine and other things
[34:24.960 --> 34:28.960]  and the media tries to ignore it and or attack it.
[34:28.960 --> 34:32.480]  So this is such an important report by John Bay on the vilification
[34:32.480 --> 34:38.640]  of ivermectin because it shows Rachel Maddow and all these teleprompter readers
[34:38.640 --> 34:42.080]  going it's ridiculous.
[34:42.880 --> 34:50.880]  People went to the the hospital and they were real sick
[34:50.880 --> 34:57.520]  from injecting cow medicine that's injectable and so they drank it.
[34:57.520 --> 35:02.240]  Well I worked for a large animal vet but anybody can go to track your supply or
[35:02.240 --> 35:05.920]  any other place and buy ivermectin for horses and cows
[35:05.920 --> 35:13.520]  and it looks like a tube of caulk or putty. It's not an injector as a needle
[35:13.520 --> 35:20.240]  it's an injector into the mouth so that just like you can
[35:20.240 --> 35:23.760]  when you're giving a child antibiotics it has a little plastic injector you
[35:23.760 --> 35:27.360]  slurp it up out of the bottle and then squirt it into their mouth.
[35:27.360 --> 35:30.080]  So again they tried to make it just sound crazy like they're taking an
[35:30.080 --> 35:35.680]  injectable thing you inject like a needle in there it's drinking it.
[35:35.680 --> 35:39.760]  It's the exact same molecule as the ivermectin
[35:39.760 --> 35:43.760]  capsules that you get from a doctor and again
[35:43.760 --> 35:46.880]  I can show you the head of the Tokyo Medical Association say we have our
[35:46.880 --> 35:50.560]  10,000 patients 100 cure rate if caught early
[35:50.560 --> 35:53.920]  then they show the statistics out of Africa countries that give out ivermectin
[35:53.920 --> 35:58.400]  twice a year versus countries that don't. India has a super low death rate and
[35:58.400 --> 36:00.480]  problem right now because they're handing out ivermectin.
[36:00.480 --> 36:04.240]  I've got all the reports and I've got Oxford University and all these big
[36:04.240 --> 36:08.800]  universities going no actually ivermectin's amazing
[36:08.800 --> 36:12.480]  but Rachel Maddow and the young Turks and all them when they are attacking me
[36:12.480 --> 36:16.960]  by name. Jones is a caulk he's telling his
[36:16.960 --> 36:21.760]  followers go take dewormer paste that's one thing
[36:21.760 --> 36:26.400]  ivermectin does and I've sat there with cows
[36:26.400 --> 36:29.120]  over a thousand of them in one day it's an exhausting job
[36:29.120 --> 36:32.880]  where you run them into shoots put them a squeeze shoot so that you can control
[36:32.880 --> 36:36.560]  them and you put tongs in their nose and you
[36:36.560 --> 36:40.320]  tie up their face put the tongs in the nose to hold them
[36:40.320 --> 36:44.880]  you tie it up on the bar and then you take
[36:44.880 --> 36:48.960]  the ivermectin dose she's about three doses per container
[36:48.960 --> 36:53.040]  and you stick the metal the the plastic tube in their mouth doesn't hurt them
[36:53.040 --> 36:56.800]  and you inject into their mouth not into their body
[36:56.800 --> 37:02.000]  into their mouth the ivermectin dose
[37:02.240 --> 37:05.760]  and then you throw in a trash can and you let that cow out
[37:05.760 --> 37:10.480]  and they run the next cow in and my job's been
[37:10.480 --> 37:14.080]  running them into the pen with a cattle prod my job's been running the squeeze
[37:14.080 --> 37:17.040]  shoot my job's been clamping her head down
[37:17.040 --> 37:24.640]  again from the medicine i know madel but anybody can go read the case of it
[37:24.640 --> 37:29.200]  at the farm supply place or at the veterinary supply place
[37:29.200 --> 37:32.480]  you can read on the side how you do it you do not inject it
[37:32.480 --> 37:37.200]  into their body so people that are taking it are taking it the right way
[37:37.200 --> 37:41.280]  into their mouths but they know that they lie at every
[37:41.280 --> 37:46.640]  level because we are their enemies and they want you dead they think there's
[37:46.640 --> 37:49.920]  too many people they want the planet for themselves
[37:49.920 --> 37:53.360]  they are depopulationists
[37:54.160 --> 37:57.360]  indian state will offer ivermectin to entire adult population
[37:57.360 --> 38:01.440]  even as who warns against its use as covid-19 treatment
[38:01.440 --> 38:05.920]  no one listens to the WHO the head of the WHO vaccine program
[38:05.920 --> 38:09.840]  in 2019 in switzerland had an emergency meeting a two-day meeting
[38:09.840 --> 38:13.520]  we did reports on it and said vaccines don't work they're dangerous they're
[38:13.520 --> 38:17.440]  killing people and everyone's turning against us
[38:17.440 --> 38:20.800]  and their response was release a bio weapon and then poses savers
[38:20.800 --> 38:24.320]  to make you take even more deadly stuff they're covering up their previous
[38:24.320 --> 38:28.160]  crimes with even bigger giant new crime which they intend to cover up with even
[38:28.160 --> 38:32.160]  bigger crimes i've learned their philosophy
[38:32.160 --> 38:35.280]  so i've got all this incredible news and all this breaking information but the
[38:35.280 --> 38:41.360]  big issue is that these murderers
[38:41.360 --> 38:45.680]  are lying to the public and trying to
[38:45.680 --> 38:50.560]  create political correctness around drugs
[38:51.200 --> 38:54.960]  so that people don't get treatment and most hospitals will not give
[38:54.960 --> 39:01.040]  ivermectin in the united states and most of people dying did not get ivermectin
[39:01.040 --> 39:06.320]  and did not get steroids inhalable steroids and i'm going to tell you again
[39:06.320 --> 39:10.240]  my mother and my father did not tell me for a week they weren't home sick i went
[39:10.240 --> 39:12.960]  over there they looked like they were dead my dad especially
[39:12.960 --> 39:17.440]  could barely get up i got him within five hours
[39:17.440 --> 39:21.120]  on the inhalable steroids the ivermectin all of it and he was running
[39:21.120 --> 39:24.400]  around the next day to some chairs that got delivered that weren't put
[39:24.400 --> 39:28.560]  together putting chairs together and cooking food
[39:28.560 --> 39:32.160]  just like that and if you got even earlier it'd have been the same thing
[39:32.160 --> 39:35.520]  and then i saw it with countless friends and others because this stuff's run
[39:35.520 --> 39:40.560]  through austin 80 of people have this stuff okay
[39:40.560 --> 39:45.120]  just like that i know i've experienced it and i have the
[39:45.120 --> 39:48.800]  scientist and how angry should that make us
[39:48.800 --> 39:52.160]  that they're all over the place
[39:53.680 --> 39:57.520]  celebrating people dying from it saying oh look we told you covid's real
[39:57.520 --> 40:02.240]  these people are sick so again here is rachel madow
[40:02.240 --> 40:07.200]  failed talk show host or cancel her show lying to her victims
[40:07.200 --> 40:11.600]  drank an injectable ivermectin formulation
[40:11.600 --> 40:15.360]  intended for use in cattle in an attempt to prevent
[40:15.360 --> 40:19.600]  covid-19 infection this patient presented to a hospital with confusion
[40:19.600 --> 40:25.040]  drowsiness visual hallucinations tachypnea which is rapid breathing
[40:25.040 --> 40:30.880]  also tremors the patient recovered after being hospitalized for nine days
[40:30.880 --> 40:38.400]  nine days nine days in the hospital drinking injectable
[40:38.400 --> 40:44.400]  ivermectin formulated as an injection that you would shoot into a cow
[40:44.400 --> 40:48.880]  so there you go ladies and gentlemen they think you're stupid and the people
[40:48.880 --> 40:52.400]  perish for lack of knowledge all right the really big news
[40:52.400 --> 40:55.600]  i've already gotten to some of it but i'm gonna hit how it ties together
[40:55.600 --> 40:59.440]  with a new article by jamie white at info wars dot com
[40:59.440 --> 41:03.760]  info wars was trending so was alex jones again on twitter yesterday
[41:03.760 --> 41:07.680]  also on instagram because people are like what the rockefeller foundation and
[41:07.680 --> 41:11.040]  the un are standardizing the global vaccine passport
[41:11.040 --> 41:14.240]  and now they're saying to buy and sell or to quote trudeau
[41:14.240 --> 41:20.000]  to engage in commerce
[41:20.720 --> 41:25.280]  you will take shots every five months now
[41:25.280 --> 41:28.960]  and then had it already all pre-plant has nothing to do about protecting you
[41:28.960 --> 41:33.440]  it destroys your immune system and then when you die of a regular cold or
[41:33.440 --> 41:36.160]  flu because you have no immune system because it turns your white blood cells
[41:36.160 --> 41:38.640]  off they will come out and say that it's the
[41:38.640 --> 41:41.680]  unvaccinated that caused it the unvaccinated will never admit they've
[41:41.680 --> 41:44.640]  been victimized by the globalist so they will come after you and your
[41:44.640 --> 41:50.240]  family who are smart incredible the australian government
[41:50.240 --> 41:53.520]  came out yesterday and said get used to it every five months you will take

[42:55.760 --> 42:58.880]  operation thanks for your support the purpose of fear
[42:58.880 --> 43:02.320]  is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of
[43:02.320 --> 43:06.080]  today half the population has lined up for an untested
[43:06.080 --> 43:10.000]  deadly and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be
[43:10.000 --> 43:14.560]  afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease the perpetrators of all this
[43:14.560 --> 43:18.320]  have clearly stated their goal of having 80 percent of the population
[43:18.320 --> 43:23.040]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years
[43:23.040 --> 43:26.640]  for those of us who have awoken from the spell we know this is all really
[43:26.640 --> 43:29.760]  happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see
[43:29.760 --> 43:34.000]  but there is only two things to do we continue sounding the alarm
[43:34.000 --> 43:37.760]  because it's a numbers game if enough people awaken from the cold spell
[43:37.760 --> 43:41.520]  then we win but even when we win and we eventually will
[43:41.520 --> 43:44.800]  the days of convenience are soon coming to an end and so
[43:44.800 --> 43:48.480]  we must prepare get up to a years worth of storable foods
[43:48.480 --> 43:51.920]  water filtration survival gear seeds
[43:51.920 --> 43:56.320]  shortwave radios and lifesaving knowledge at info or store
[43:56.320 --> 44:01.040]  dot com i've been fighting as hard as i can for almost 28 years
[44:01.040 --> 44:05.120]  against the globalist i wanted to stop their agenda i wanted to wake up the
[44:05.120 --> 44:08.640]  world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went
[44:08.640 --> 44:12.400]  operational but we failed yes a lot of people are awake
[44:12.400 --> 44:15.600]  yes we're not getting caught flat-footed but they are going
[44:15.600 --> 44:19.280]  ahead with their full operational deindustrialization
[44:19.280 --> 44:22.160]  great reset and that's why it's more important than ever
[44:22.160 --> 44:26.240]  than all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show
[44:26.240 --> 44:29.840]  because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth so we've got a
[44:29.840 --> 44:32.400]  information warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda
[44:32.400 --> 44:35.360]  but we've also got to get personally prepared and one of the number one
[44:35.360 --> 44:38.240]  things to do is high quality storable food we've got the best food

[45:59.440 --> 46:03.520]  there's one central fact of criminal psychology
[46:03.520 --> 46:09.760]  the criminologists all agree on and that its criminals are extremely pathological
[46:09.760 --> 46:13.280]  even more the general public they do the same things over and over again
[46:13.280 --> 46:16.640]  and criminals like to commit the same types of crimes
[46:16.640 --> 46:20.480]  over and over again well guess what it was
[46:20.480 --> 46:24.880]  Anthony Fauci and eugenicist's globalist that
[46:24.880 --> 46:29.040]  ran the rollout of hiv and the mistreatment of it with act and other
[46:29.040 --> 46:32.400]  chemicals that actually killed more people than hiv and they were the ones
[46:32.400 --> 46:36.240]  involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go
[46:36.240 --> 46:39.360]  attack the t lymphocytes of the body and create auto immune
[46:39.360 --> 46:43.360]  disorders the problem for them was the viruses would then
[46:43.360 --> 46:46.800]  break down and would be non-lethal down the road
[46:46.800 --> 46:50.080]  that's why they need to roll out the coven 19 and the vaccine
[46:50.080 --> 46:53.440]  because now they admit the coven 19 vaccine destroys your immune system
[46:53.440 --> 46:59.360]  basically giving you the equivalent of hiv that's right ladies and gentlemen
[47:02.080 --> 47:09.360]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:09.360 --> 47:23.600]  and we are again back live thank you so much
[47:23.600 --> 47:27.440]  for joining us on this
[47:27.920 --> 47:33.840]  tuesday august 31st worldwide transmission we have a very special guest
[47:33.840 --> 47:39.600]  joining us coming up in the third hour today
[47:39.600 --> 47:47.280]  dr judy a mikovitz who worked directly with Fauci
[47:47.280 --> 47:51.440]  in the nih and the cdc and saw his criminal activity
[47:51.440 --> 47:54.800]  and blew the whistle on him but of course he was in the film
[47:54.800 --> 47:58.640]  pandemic that came out last year that they demonized an attack that went
[47:58.640 --> 48:03.920]  viral and just like they attack iver mekton
[48:03.920 --> 48:07.040]  and go oh that's for horses that's stupid that's crazy when it was invented
[48:07.040 --> 48:09.680]  for humans and japanese go oh no this is absolutely
[48:09.680 --> 48:13.440]  anti-viral and it's been proven to be so
[48:13.520 --> 48:17.280]  they go oh sure she worked with him but she's a kook she got arrested
[48:17.280 --> 48:21.360]  yeah they came and arrested her to cover up what foul she was doing just like
[48:21.360 --> 48:25.840]  they're trying to arrest me but i don't need to believe dr
[48:25.840 --> 48:30.720]  mikovitz he was a great lady i already know about Fauci going back to
[48:30.720 --> 48:34.160]  the 80s her issues were in the 90s with him
[48:34.160 --> 48:37.760]  i mean this guy has been involved in eugenics and the hiv rollout and
[48:37.760 --> 48:40.960]  blocking good treatments and giving people poison treatments
[48:40.960 --> 48:43.520]  forever
[48:44.880 --> 48:51.120]  so that is coming up ladies and gentlemen in the third hour we're gonna
[48:51.120 --> 48:55.760]  open the phones up in the second hour and go over to ton of news as well
[48:55.760 --> 48:59.760]  and let me just stop for a moment because if
[48:59.760 --> 49:04.560]  if we don't do this it actually helps the globalist
[49:04.560 --> 49:09.520]  if we just normalize all this evil and kind of just glaze over this
[49:09.520 --> 49:13.760]  then we just become acclimated to accept it including myself we have to let
[49:13.760 --> 49:18.320]  this really burn in and and really hit us at the core
[49:18.320 --> 49:22.240]  so we can reach out to others and try to wake them up because so much of what
[49:22.240 --> 49:28.160]  the globalist bank on is that by the time the average person is 20
[49:28.160 --> 49:32.240]  years old who's been born the last 60 years
[49:32.240 --> 49:35.600]  they have seen hundreds of thousands of murders
[49:35.600 --> 49:41.040]  hundreds of thousands of rapes they've seen spaceships blow up dc
[49:41.040 --> 49:44.560]  they've seen torture they've seen saw they've seen
[49:44.560 --> 49:48.400]  friday the 13th and and i'm not calling for censorship of all that
[49:48.400 --> 49:51.600]  but when you play shoot them up video games and when you
[49:51.600 --> 49:54.960]  watch all these violent movies it desensitizes you
[49:54.960 --> 49:58.080]  to the real thing
[49:58.800 --> 50:02.160]  my dad's dad was in world war two and saw a lot of combat
[50:02.160 --> 50:06.800]  in the air and then after he did his missions on the ground in idly
[50:06.800 --> 50:11.440]  and he was a tough guy and if there was a bunch of violence in a
[50:11.440 --> 50:16.560]  movie he'd get up and leave just because it wasn't a joke to him
[50:16.560 --> 50:20.640]  and he'd grown up not seeing violence in movies he'd seen it in the real world
[50:20.640 --> 50:24.000]  he'd seen blood and people's guts blown out and their you know heads blown off
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.600]  and and and starving dead children and bombed out
[50:27.600 --> 50:31.520]  craters with dead families on them so and bodies covered with maggots and all
[50:31.520 --> 50:34.720]  the rest of it so he didn't think it was cute he wasn't
[50:34.720 --> 50:37.520]  desensitized
[50:39.120 --> 50:42.160]  you read something like kurt vonnegut slaughterhouse five which is a story
[50:42.160 --> 50:48.000]  about him in world war two shot down in an old
[50:48.000 --> 50:51.120]  slaughterhouse they were using for american POWs and
[50:51.120 --> 50:54.480]  what it was like to have our own planes dropping bombs on him
[50:54.480 --> 50:57.120]  people read that today they're not that shocked because they've read so much
[50:57.120 --> 50:59.920]  they've seen so much they don't actually experience
[50:59.920 --> 51:03.840]  by people reading that back in the 60s did about what it was like to be bombed
[51:03.840 --> 51:06.720]  by your own planes
[51:09.920 --> 51:14.000]  so it's the same thing people don't differentiate
[51:14.000 --> 51:19.360]  fiction from nonfiction this bio attack this globalist attack is not fiction
[51:19.360 --> 51:24.320]  this world id and this system designed to turn the economy off
[51:24.320 --> 51:27.840]  with new climate lockdowns now being announced in europe and canada and
[51:27.840 --> 51:32.400]  coming here this isn't a joke this is real
[51:32.400 --> 51:35.840]  and look i know the audience knows we're like yeah we know that this is real
[51:35.840 --> 51:42.240]  versus fiction yeah but still at a subconscious level
[51:42.240 --> 51:47.040]  you've already seen alien suckers on people's faces and
[51:47.040 --> 51:51.040]  aliens busting on a people's chest and eating their intestines
[51:51.040 --> 51:55.840]  you've already seen all this stuff in movies and all the zombie movies of
[51:55.840 --> 51:59.760]  millions being mowed down dead in the pentagon dust drills of mowing down
[51:59.760 --> 52:02.880]  zombies that means mowing down crowds of starving people
[52:02.880 --> 52:05.920]  the globalists are getting ready for that they're engineering the controlled
[52:05.920 --> 52:09.600]  collapse they're going to build their armored fortresses
[52:09.600 --> 52:12.960]  their safe reservations the rest of us are going to be left on the outside to
[52:12.960 --> 52:15.600]  kill each other and and so it's a self-fulfilling
[52:15.600 --> 52:19.120]  prophecy to see yourself as garbage to see yourselves
[52:19.120 --> 52:23.840]  as zombies and now microsoft put out a video game
[52:23.840 --> 52:29.120]  called stay homer where the chinese military works with the u.s military
[52:29.120 --> 52:34.240]  here it is on screen going around launching rpgs into crowds of teenagers
[52:34.240 --> 52:42.240]  and killing them because they all deserve to die
[52:42.240 --> 52:46.480]  so when i get up here and i read this stuff to you on air
[52:46.480 --> 52:49.360]  this is real
[52:53.200 --> 52:58.400]  so let me tell you what's coming up next hour interspersed with your calls here
[52:58.400 --> 53:00.800]  global bombshell is it all ties together
[53:00.800 --> 53:05.760]  WHO releases plan for global digital vaccine passport
[53:05.760 --> 53:08.640]  funded by bill gates and rockerfeller foundation
[53:08.640 --> 53:12.240]  info wars dot com
[53:13.280 --> 53:16.240]  and people are freaking out about this right now
[53:16.240 --> 53:20.000]  because it says developed by the rockerfeller foundation
[53:20.000 --> 53:23.760]  and the bill millen gates foundation you can see the screenshot of it all
[53:23.760 --> 53:27.840]  the excellent article by jammy white but let me show you the actual documents
[53:27.840 --> 53:31.840]  they're on twitter WHO has published a guidance document
[53:31.840 --> 53:35.280]  for countries implementing partners on the introduction of digital vaccine
[53:35.280 --> 53:38.800]  certificates run by the bill millen gates foundation
[53:38.800 --> 53:43.680]  amongst others and the rockerfeller foundation
[53:43.680 --> 53:48.160]  and here are the documents you can see it right here
[53:48.160 --> 53:53.200]  where it says digital documentation coming out in certificate the global
[53:53.200 --> 53:56.800]  standard run by the united nations
[53:56.800 --> 54:02.080]  digital documentation covered 19 certificates vaccine status
[54:02.080 --> 54:07.360]  and it says right here the work was funded by the bill millen gates foundation
[54:07.360 --> 54:11.280]  the government of estonia foundation
[54:11.280 --> 54:16.640]  bontar state of collate and the rockerfeller foundation
[54:16.640 --> 54:21.760]  so that's who runs all this and we've got the entire document right here and i
[54:21.760 --> 54:24.240]  don't need to read the document though i did scan over it this morning
[54:24.240 --> 54:27.680]  it's already seen their plan studying it for years it's all right here
[54:27.680 --> 54:31.840]  but but here's the plan digital documentation
[54:31.840 --> 54:36.240]  of covered 19 certificates vaccination status the total control of all society
[54:36.240 --> 54:39.360]  the world id including an implantable microchip
[54:39.360 --> 54:44.880]  and even how they use blockchain to track you by satellite and by smart chip
[54:44.880 --> 54:49.120]  to then pay you according to how you behave
[54:49.120 --> 54:52.640]  and how this will then implement the carbon tax and the carbon tracking
[54:52.640 --> 54:56.480]  control system now schwaab already wrote books on it five years ago
[54:56.480 --> 55:00.080]  we already know the plan but here it is an implementation
[55:00.080 --> 55:04.400]  don't have to wait anymore it's in your face okay and look at this
[55:04.400 --> 55:07.840]  forbs world needs equivalent of pandemic lockdown
[55:07.840 --> 55:12.160]  every two years to meet paris climate goals
[55:12.160 --> 55:16.640]  berlin university canteens cuts meat from the menus to curb climate change
[55:16.640 --> 55:19.680]  bbc extinction rebellion protests block
[55:19.680 --> 55:24.160]  london tower bridge that's what all these lockdowns are

[55:35.520 --> 55:39.440]  passport and we're going to use this to implement
[55:39.440 --> 55:43.040]  how we're going to save the environment and the housing crisis
[55:43.040 --> 55:47.680]  and universal income but with it comes control and he says that
[55:47.680 --> 55:53.120]  i mean folks this is slavery like being a goldfish in a gold in a
[55:53.120 --> 55:56.400]  fish tank yeah the fish is in there but it it
[55:56.400 --> 55:59.200]  it lives according to you it's under your control

[56:22.560 --> 56:27.600]  exploding crime getting rid of the police except for themselves

[56:31.840 --> 56:35.760]  population by 2030 that's in the next nine years do you
[56:35.760 --> 56:39.760]  have any idea the hell we're about to enter

[56:43.600 --> 56:46.640]  collapse borders by design race war by design
[56:46.640 --> 56:51.040]  and that's another reason you need to get out of the big cities

[59:23.600 --> 59:26.560]  we've also got to get personally prepared and one of the number one
[59:26.560 --> 59:29.440]  things to do is high quality storeable food we've got the best food

[59:50.000 --> 59:59.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[59:59.680 --> 1:00:20.400]  all right we're now into hour number two we have a huge whistleblower
[1:00:20.400 --> 1:00:26.480]  that funded major operations worked very very high levels and blew the whistle
[1:00:26.480 --> 1:00:32.720]  on Fauci joining us coming up in the next hour dr.
[1:00:32.720 --> 1:00:37.520]  judy a mikovitz she courses the main person in
[1:00:37.520 --> 1:00:40.320]  pandemic a film that really exposed these guys
[1:00:40.320 --> 1:00:46.560]  i really look forward to having dr judy a mikovitz on the transmission
[1:00:46.560 --> 1:00:51.280]  i'm going to give the number out next segment and go back to your calls
[1:00:51.280 --> 1:00:54.560]  first time callers on your reports of what the vaccines have done to you and
[1:00:54.560 --> 1:00:57.920]  your family if you love it you hate it or you're neutral on it
[1:00:57.920 --> 1:01:01.280]  what experiences are you seeing in hospitals you work at
[1:01:01.280 --> 1:01:07.920]  we'll give that number out coming up next segment when some stations join us
[1:01:07.920 --> 1:01:11.200]  in the meantime
[1:01:13.200 --> 1:01:17.440]  there's not many people more creepy than ryan sculptor
[1:01:17.440 --> 1:01:20.560]  and one of them is michael more at the start of the next segment i'm going to
[1:01:20.560 --> 1:01:24.480]  get some into him because he says that after afghanistan
[1:01:24.480 --> 1:01:31.840]  evacuation time to defend america against their own domestic Taliban
[1:01:31.840 --> 1:01:34.960]  and you dub tell this with these different soldiers online saying
[1:01:34.960 --> 1:01:38.400]  we're preparing for martial law stay in your houses when we say or we're going
[1:01:38.400 --> 1:01:44.080]  to kill you that all ties in to the globalist model of
[1:01:44.080 --> 1:01:49.280]  using nato and the u.s military to suppress domestic populations and
[1:01:49.280 --> 1:01:53.440]  they want to do this to get the good people out of the military
[1:01:53.440 --> 1:01:59.280]  so i mean these people know what they're doing they know what they're part of
[1:01:59.360 --> 1:02:03.360]  we're going to tie all that together
[1:02:03.520 --> 1:02:06.400]  with the announcements being made around the world about how
[1:02:06.400 --> 1:02:10.640]  they're going to have new carbon lockdowns and i've got the prime minister
[1:02:10.640 --> 1:02:15.360]  of canada on that and more we're going to be playing
[1:02:15.360 --> 1:02:20.720]  but just like i said let's let this sink in earlier
[1:02:20.720 --> 1:02:26.400]  about how they have studies in japan studies in england studies in germany
[1:02:26.400 --> 1:02:31.680]  studies in all over africa studies all over
[1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:37.200]  south america and all they know is people that take ivermectin twice a
[1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:40.800]  year prophylactically don't get all these weird
[1:02:40.800 --> 1:02:45.760]  jungle fevers don't get all sorts of things
[1:02:45.760 --> 1:02:52.480]  not just worms and again the fact that they set up
[1:02:52.480 --> 1:02:56.880]  there on the news ago it's just crazy that people are buying this up and the
[1:02:56.880 --> 1:03:00.720]  doctors are prescribing this and so when i go and i got
[1:03:00.720 --> 1:03:04.880]  medical doctors to prescribe this stuff to more than 50 people i know they've
[1:03:04.880 --> 1:03:08.480]  gotten sick the last few months they go okay well where's the mom and pop
[1:03:08.480 --> 1:03:12.000]  pharmacy because the big pharmacies won't even do it
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:15.760]  even though they've got ivermectin for humans
[1:03:16.320 --> 1:03:20.480]  and again that's murder that's bureaucratic
[1:03:20.480 --> 1:03:26.000]  murder and the japanese are just as good as the west at medicine or anything
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:28.640]  else they're just as smart they're just as high
[1:03:28.640 --> 1:03:33.200]  iq as as as any other group okay they're amongst the smartest people in the
[1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:36.320]  world no one's debating that and the media
[1:03:36.320 --> 1:03:39.760]  notice won't touch the japanese government and japanese groups
[1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:44.080]  and japanese heads of japanese medical unions saying
[1:03:44.080 --> 1:03:49.280]  100 success rate you've taken early 70 something percent if it's in the
[1:03:49.280 --> 1:03:52.720]  latter stages i've seen it so i've got hundreds of
[1:03:52.720 --> 1:03:55.360]  clips to play hundreds of articles incredible stuff to cover
[1:03:55.360 --> 1:03:58.880]  i'm just gonna go ivermectin ivermectin because it
[1:03:58.880 --> 1:04:02.320]  it physically causes me to have you know that burning
[1:04:02.320 --> 1:04:08.240]  fire feeling in your chest um where my body is commanding me to go out and get
[1:04:08.240 --> 1:04:10.800]  aggressive with people killing folks that come to these
[1:04:10.800 --> 1:04:13.680]  hospitals that won't give it to them now a lot of hospitals are and they're good
[1:04:13.680 --> 1:04:16.880]  and they're bucking the system say about half of them but
[1:04:16.880 --> 1:04:20.480]  hospitals that aren't folks need to be protested and demonstrated against and
[1:04:20.480 --> 1:04:23.840]  hit with the truth
[1:04:24.080 --> 1:04:27.360]  because they're ignoring the science they're ignoring the history
[1:04:27.360 --> 1:04:31.200]  they're ignoring the realities of all of this
[1:04:31.200 --> 1:04:35.280]  and it's criminal it really is criminal they have all these newscasts
[1:04:35.280 --> 1:04:39.520]  making fun of people show that other hospitals and doctors won't subscribe
[1:04:39.520 --> 1:04:43.680]  it when they know good and damn well it works and i experienced it

[1:06:12.560 --> 1:06:18.400]  worldwide it's alex jones well i'm very honored to be here with you
[1:06:18.400 --> 1:06:22.560]  on this august 31st 2021 transmission thank you all for your prayer thank you
[1:06:22.560 --> 1:06:25.520]  for your support we're all in this together
[1:06:25.520 --> 1:06:30.880]  i want to tie three big stories together and then tie that to what's
[1:06:30.880 --> 1:06:33.840]  happening in afghanistan that i'm going to go to your phone
[1:06:33.840 --> 1:06:38.080]  calls we're going to open the number up right now in the phone system up
[1:06:38.080 --> 1:06:42.400]  for first-time callers to give us your take on the suppression of ivermectin
[1:06:42.400 --> 1:06:46.160]  and hydroxychloroquine the media also trying to suppress
[1:06:46.160 --> 1:06:49.360]  Regeneron which may have side effects down the road
[1:06:49.360 --> 1:06:53.680]  but at least they've got liability uh and they're not giving government
[1:06:53.680 --> 1:06:56.640]  shielding they've been around since the 1980s they've got a bunch of patented
[1:06:56.640 --> 1:06:59.760]  stuff that works and i know people that have taken Regeneron
[1:06:59.760 --> 1:07:05.040]  and it's like 100% in like again five six hours just you're you're better
[1:07:05.040 --> 1:07:08.000]  just like trump said last year he was telling the truth and i see the left
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:11.120]  attacking me again without even looking on instagram and twitter and
[1:07:11.120 --> 1:07:14.640]  facebook people sent it to me going look at this scum
[1:07:14.640 --> 1:07:20.160]  the fbi needs to arrest jones he's not a doctor he shouldn't talk about uh
[1:07:20.160 --> 1:07:23.680]  Regeneron i mean he shouldn't talk about vitamin
[1:07:23.680 --> 1:07:27.680]  dear ivermectin he needs to be locked up as
[1:07:27.680 --> 1:07:31.520]  citizens we're allowed to talk about our personal experiences
[1:07:31.520 --> 1:07:34.800]  with a doctor or a drug you know even bill marr said
[1:07:34.800 --> 1:07:39.440]  i don't want google censoring ivermectin it's not a republican it's a drug
[1:07:39.440 --> 1:07:43.120]  what a tell he wants them censoring republicans i guess
[1:07:43.120 --> 1:07:48.080]  but not drugs he wants to know but they censored all the hundreds of studies
[1:07:48.080 --> 1:07:52.880]  over the last 50 years about it and if you understand that you understand
[1:07:52.880 --> 1:07:56.080]  everything and in fairness to bill marr he says i shouldn't be censored and
[1:07:56.080 --> 1:08:00.400]  that they are wrong but but he's he's trying to get
[1:08:00.400 --> 1:08:03.760]  his audience to come along for free speech and go hey it's not a republican
[1:08:03.760 --> 1:08:06.400]  it's a drug
[1:08:07.040 --> 1:08:11.760]  so this is tyranny and we need to get past this this being a partisan
[1:08:11.760 --> 1:08:15.200]  a partisan issue this is attacking everybody
[1:08:15.200 --> 1:08:18.320]  and that's why i'm more than happy to attack trump when he supports these
[1:08:18.320 --> 1:08:21.440]  poison shots i wanted trump to fight the globalist i want
[1:08:21.440 --> 1:08:24.880]  to trump to secure the borders i wanted trump to protect our guns i wanted
[1:08:24.880 --> 1:08:29.440]  trump to stay up to china he did all that that's great
[1:08:29.440 --> 1:08:34.480]  but he's our employee and it's like if you've got an employee that 300 days out
[1:08:34.480 --> 1:08:42.880]  of the year does a great job but let's just say that last 65 days
[1:08:42.880 --> 1:08:46.560]  you catch him taking a dump in the in the you know in your office it's not a
[1:08:46.560 --> 1:08:50.000]  good thing and taking a dump in your office is
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:54.480]  a lot nicer than pushing a poison shot i don't want to use a gross analogy here
[1:08:54.480 --> 1:08:58.960]  i'm just simply saying that
[1:09:00.240 --> 1:09:04.000]  trump is dead wrong when he got up there on that podium in alabama and he got
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:09.360]  booed rightfully and he said it works it works great if it
[1:09:09.360 --> 1:09:13.440]  doesn't work i'll tell you it's down to 39 efficacy and it lowers
[1:09:13.440 --> 1:09:16.800]  your immune system that's admitted now now they want booster shots every five
[1:09:16.800 --> 1:09:21.040]  to six months it's bull and trepon fox and friends
[1:09:21.040 --> 1:09:24.960]  said that days before he said oh this is a scam
[1:09:24.960 --> 1:09:28.560]  they're gonna make 10 million off the boosters uh yeah
[1:09:28.560 --> 1:09:33.280]  yeah so you're not stupid i said you're smart you know what you're doing or
[1:09:33.280 --> 1:09:37.280]  maybe you're stupid it'd be better if you were stupid
[1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:41.760]  and of course the media ran with that and uh you know oh alex jones
[1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:46.640]  turns on trump betrays trump i didn't betray anything
[1:09:46.640 --> 1:09:50.000]  i know trump got stampeded and supporting these vaccines because he trusted
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:53.360]  the doctors and thought they were going to hold the economy hostage till he
[1:09:53.360 --> 1:09:56.640]  got this approved and then he thought he'd be a hero but these aren't good
[1:09:56.640 --> 1:09:59.760]  medical systems this is a corrupt globalist move this is not a regular
[1:09:59.760 --> 1:10:03.680]  vaccine trump that might have side effects but actually works
[1:10:03.680 --> 1:10:08.880]  it's poison you got conned you got lied to
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:12.880]  and i've talked to people that have talked at link with trump and got him
[1:10:12.880 --> 1:10:16.800]  to say at least you have your own freedom you shouldn't be made to take it
[1:10:16.800 --> 1:10:22.640]  that took doing with trump now he does respond to his base and now i think
[1:10:22.640 --> 1:10:26.400]  you're gonna start hearing more criticism of these injections good
[1:10:26.400 --> 1:10:30.560]  because i'm not trying to win popularity contest or not trying to have
[1:10:30.560 --> 1:10:32.480]  truck call me up and tell me how great i am
[1:10:32.480 --> 1:10:36.560]  he's already done that plenty of times i don't give a damn about that
[1:10:36.560 --> 1:10:40.880]  not about how powerful i am or who i know or any strap i live in texas
[1:10:40.880 --> 1:10:45.520]  i don't want to live in dc or marlago or la around the power structure
[1:10:45.520 --> 1:10:50.400]  i've been in texas my whole life my family founded texas on both sides
[1:10:50.400 --> 1:10:53.280]  people ask why i'm in austin because my family's been here
[1:10:53.280 --> 1:10:58.320]  since the 1820s when it was waterloo
[1:10:58.480 --> 1:11:02.160]  and yes it's now la and it's horrible and i'm probably gonna move
[1:11:02.160 --> 1:11:04.960]  i don't have the money to move the infrastructure i'll move it to some
[1:11:04.960 --> 1:11:09.600]  right-wing city in austin but there's no right-wing cities in texas
[1:11:09.600 --> 1:11:11.680]  all right i'm ranting and i said i covered the news let me give you the
[1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:23.440]  number it's 877-789-2539 877-789 alex 877-789-2539
[1:11:23.440 --> 1:11:29.120]  okay let me tell all these things together you got michael more
[1:11:29.120 --> 1:11:34.000]  saying after afghanistan evacuation time to defend america against our own
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:39.280]  domestic taliban he goes on to say those that attack the capital and those
[1:11:39.280 --> 1:11:42.800]  republicans that question the election they are against our
[1:11:42.800 --> 1:11:46.720]  domestic laws and they are our domestic taliban
[1:11:46.720 --> 1:11:50.480]  we must strengthen ourselves against them and they're the terror threat
[1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:54.880]  and we must use the military against them the domestic taliban
[1:11:54.880 --> 1:11:59.840]  the quotes are all there you can go read it if you want
[1:11:59.840 --> 1:12:04.320]  and then he attacks southern baptist and says they're like the taliban and
[1:12:04.320 --> 1:12:08.000]  christians are bad i mean look at the photo of this guy on tv viewer
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:11.600]  just just look i'm not saying he's a pedophile
[1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:14.560]  i'm saying if i was going to cast two guys that drive around a white van a
[1:12:14.560 --> 1:12:17.440]  movie and kidnap children and then take them to an underground
[1:12:17.440 --> 1:12:23.120]  dungeon and drink their blood that is i mean look at that demon zoom in on him
[1:12:24.400 --> 1:12:27.280]  he sure as hell wants to molest our rights and start a civil war
[1:12:27.280 --> 1:12:31.280]  i know that not saying he's a child molester he's saying if i was going to
[1:12:31.280 --> 1:12:36.560]  cast somebody in the movie to play one he'd be it now
[1:12:36.560 --> 1:12:41.040]  let's continue i mean would i place a bet
[1:12:41.040 --> 1:12:45.120]  yeah you know i'd place a bet as well at my right arm
[1:12:45.120 --> 1:12:50.480]  the point is is that they're spoiling for a war with us
[1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:53.680]  i get the clip right please just like the woman
[1:12:53.680 --> 1:12:57.520]  who now defends herself and is a big leftist saying hey
[1:12:57.520 --> 1:13:00.320]  you don't do what we say you don't stay in your house during a lockdown i'm
[1:13:00.320 --> 1:13:05.200]  gonna kill you ass it's called martial law they sign up because their whole
[1:13:05.200 --> 1:13:08.880]  right of passage is hating america their whole right of passage is no borders no
[1:13:08.880 --> 1:13:12.000]  wall no usd at all you cannot imagine how much
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:15.360]  these people hate this country and how much they want to dominate you and
[1:13:15.360 --> 1:13:18.000]  your family go ahead and roll the audio of this lady
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:21.200]  understand that if active duty military actually get deployed within the
[1:13:21.200 --> 1:13:24.080]  united states that weapon is not just pointed at
[1:13:24.080 --> 1:13:28.720]  other people other countries it's pointed at you if you do not get in your
[1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:31.360]  house when i tell you to you become the enemy
[1:13:31.360 --> 1:13:36.160]  martial law and then she goes on to say more
[1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:39.040]  so that's who these folks are and to live under martial law
[1:13:39.040 --> 1:13:44.080]  they need the digital documentation of covid-19 certificate vaccination status
[1:13:44.080 --> 1:13:47.680]  put out by the un written by the rockefeller and bill millen gates
[1:13:47.680 --> 1:13:52.480]  foundation go read it for yourself
[1:13:52.480 --> 1:13:56.960]  and that ties into all of this and so how do they respond
[1:13:56.960 --> 1:14:01.600]  twitter is removing people that post the roider article
[1:14:01.600 --> 1:14:06.400]  where roiders admits contaminated and moderna vaccine suspected to be
[1:14:06.400 --> 1:14:09.200]  metallic particles says the japanese government they've
[1:14:09.200 --> 1:14:12.960]  recalled them all first a million six then 2.5 million
[1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:18.080]  now they recalled all the moderna because it's all got nano medical
[1:14:18.080 --> 1:14:23.600]  metal particles in it what everybody say it had in it what do we predict we said
[1:14:23.600 --> 1:14:28.800]  metal nano particles to track your body and permanently mark you
[1:14:28.800 --> 1:14:32.000]  why not they're already killing you too they're already giving you a soft kill
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:36.320]  weapon that's roiders moderna vaccine
[1:14:36.320 --> 1:14:40.000]  production continues in e you amid contamination probe
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  roiders people got suspended from twitter a few
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:49.920]  months ago for saying that there was nano metal in them
[1:14:49.920 --> 1:14:55.120]  remember separate labs in germany stand it and said look it's liquid nano metal
[1:14:55.120 --> 1:15:01.280]  that moves on its own through the body and is magnetic
[1:15:01.280 --> 1:15:04.960]  remember all the electron microscope stuff and and then that people wouldn't
[1:15:04.960 --> 1:15:09.680]  take it because it wasn't approved to the FDA said oh we're approving it
[1:15:09.680 --> 1:15:13.280]  it's all semantical they go now authorizing a
[1:15:13.280 --> 1:15:16.560]  experimental shot and reauthorizing it as experimental is called
[1:15:16.560 --> 1:15:20.160]  authorizing and saying it's approved they just made it up
[1:15:20.160 --> 1:15:26.720]  no approval no test no nothing they say in 2025 they might release something
[1:15:26.720 --> 1:15:33.520]  black nano particles that are magnetic in it that are killing people
[1:15:33.520 --> 1:15:37.600]  meanwhile i've got all this video of them running people over with cars in
[1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:40.960]  australia police dogs ripping people's faces off in the
[1:15:40.960 --> 1:15:44.960]  uk horses running over women and blasting their
[1:15:44.960 --> 1:15:48.400]  faces off with water cannons blood everywhere in germany
[1:15:48.400 --> 1:15:52.480]  and the left is celebrating it and loves it they just

[1:38:08.880 --> 1:38:13.760]  bio med company we manage uh about a hundred retirement facilities uh i've
[1:38:13.760 --> 1:38:19.840]  been in and out of the the lockdown zones uh for covet for over a year have
[1:38:19.840 --> 1:38:24.320]  not not uh i didn't get the covet over that time i i
[1:38:24.320 --> 1:38:28.640]  you know credit a lot of your products for helping me uh have my immune system
[1:38:28.640 --> 1:38:32.480]  where it needs to be and that that's the thing the immune system is the key
[1:38:32.480 --> 1:38:37.760]  not the shot so um wanted to focus on on a subject i think you you focus every
[1:38:37.760 --> 1:38:41.760]  day on the information we need to know but
[1:38:41.760 --> 1:38:45.120]  um want to share my story real quick i hope i have time here for a second um
[1:38:45.120 --> 1:38:51.680]  so i uh i developed this company from the ground up uh and
[1:38:51.680 --> 1:38:55.680]  i have a local there's a local chain of hospitals
[1:38:55.680 --> 1:38:59.280]  that uh i got a very large contract with now we
[1:38:59.280 --> 1:39:02.320]  we deal with hundreds of other businesses too but this particular one is
[1:39:02.320 --> 1:39:04.800]  very they're trying to make you take the deadly shots
[1:39:04.800 --> 1:39:08.720]  they're trying to make us take the deadly shot here's the key is is so
[1:39:08.720 --> 1:39:12.320]  i'm not going to do it i'm going to lose about 70 grand a year just to cut to
[1:39:12.320 --> 1:39:15.600]  the chase i'm going to lose about 70 grand a year to my personal income that's
[1:39:15.600 --> 1:39:18.800]  not it that's not a small chunk of change as you are aware alex
[1:39:18.800 --> 1:39:22.160]  so uh i just want to talk for a minute about
[1:39:22.160 --> 1:39:26.160]  you know you you got to stand on something in your life you know if you
[1:39:26.160 --> 1:39:29.600]  know it's hard to lose stuff up front we're going to lose everything with
[1:39:29.600 --> 1:39:32.320]  these monsters doesn't make it easier to make that decision now though because
[1:39:32.320 --> 1:39:35.120]  they're like oh now it'll be every five months
[1:39:35.120 --> 1:39:39.040]  and then their own literature they had this plan the whole time this is sick
[1:39:39.040 --> 1:39:43.360]  and the thing i want to focus on too alex is is that white collar jobs are
[1:39:43.360 --> 1:39:47.040]  going to be gone um i i you know i make a good bit of money a year which is
[1:39:47.040 --> 1:39:50.480]  fantastic but guess what every single one of my customers i'm going to lose
[1:39:50.480 --> 1:39:53.200]  because i'm not going to be able to service them personally you know i have
[1:39:53.200 --> 1:39:56.240]  other people that work for me that can service them because they're dumb enough
[1:39:56.240 --> 1:40:00.800]  to take the shot but i'm not going to so that's the that's the problem is that
[1:40:00.800 --> 1:40:04.480]  those white collar jobs so people that are listening right now just be aware
[1:40:04.480 --> 1:40:08.000]  that if you are a white collar job or you're working in a medical facility
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:12.720]  it's not it's not if it's when so you have to make that decision so
[1:40:12.720 --> 1:40:17.120]  i urge everyone to develop a level of skills outside your own so if you're a
[1:40:17.120 --> 1:40:20.560]  salesperson you know if you're a a doctor or you know
[1:40:20.560 --> 1:40:24.160]  so on and so forth try to develop a level of skills outside of your work
[1:40:24.160 --> 1:40:28.240]  environment because guess what if this is i believe this is the first
[1:40:28.240 --> 1:40:31.760]  bricks is the road to the mark of the beast if it's not the mark of the beast
[1:40:31.760 --> 1:40:35.200]  we're going to be in a situation where we can't go to the store we can't work
[1:40:35.200 --> 1:40:38.560]  the rest of their plan and listen i appreciate your call god bless you
[1:40:38.560 --> 1:40:41.360]  and i can talk to you guys forever look at these collars amy

[1:44:00.720 --> 1:44:04.800]  against the globalist i wanted to stop their agenda i wanted to wake up the
[1:44:04.800 --> 1:44:08.320]  world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went
[1:44:08.320 --> 1:44:12.000]  operational but we failed yes a lot of people are awake
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:15.280]  yes we're not getting caught flat footed but they are going
[1:44:15.280 --> 1:44:18.960]  ahead with their full operational deindustrialization
[1:44:18.960 --> 1:44:22.880]  great reset and that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and

[1:44:28.800 --> 1:44:32.080]  so we've got an information warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda
[1:44:32.080 --> 1:44:35.040]  but we've also got to get personally prepared and one of the number one

[1:45:15.280 --> 1:45:18.320]  all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons i can't tell you what's
[1:45:18.320 --> 1:45:20.720]  going on but let's just say this we're going to see
[1:45:20.720 --> 1:45:24.560]  this through the end we're going to stay on air as long as we can

[1:47:28.640 --> 1:47:33.920]  well james oakie is at it again you see all these videos coming out of teacher
[1:47:33.920 --> 1:47:36.560]  saying i make my students pledge allegiance to the gay flag and the
[1:47:36.560 --> 1:47:39.440]  marxism well now they've got a new video it's up
[1:47:39.440 --> 1:47:42.880]  on info wars.com cali high school teacher reveals
[1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:48.160]  he's antifa and he's turning children into revolutionaries it's a powerful
[1:47:48.160 --> 1:47:51.840]  10-minute report at project veritas i suggest everybody go watch it but while
[1:47:51.840 --> 1:47:55.760]  we have james oakie for just one segment i want to pick his brain about this and
[1:47:55.760 --> 1:47:59.920]  some of the other work they're doing and what he expects me coming out soon is
[1:47:59.920 --> 1:48:03.440]  always like to get a little bit of a uh you know first look or idea of what's
[1:48:03.440 --> 1:48:06.640]  coming next as well but congratulations on another uh big
[1:48:06.640 --> 1:48:12.160]  find i'll give us the latest thanks alex this is a teacher in sacramento
[1:48:12.160 --> 1:48:16.800]  california he teaches advanced placement i'm reading
[1:48:16.800 --> 1:48:21.120]  here intercom high school he says he has 180 days to turn
[1:48:21.120 --> 1:48:24.400]  students into revolutionaries this was given to us
[1:48:24.400 --> 1:48:30.560]  by a whistleblower in the school had taken pictures inside the classroom
[1:48:30.560 --> 1:48:34.480]  and sent them to us he has an antifa flag in his classroom he has a
[1:48:34.480 --> 1:48:39.600]  mau flag in his classroom and and so we sent one of our undercover
[1:48:39.600 --> 1:48:43.520]  reporters to california to corroborate this and gabriel guy public high school
[1:48:43.520 --> 1:48:47.280]  teacher tells us he's given extra credit to students to go out there and
[1:48:47.280 --> 1:48:51.680]  attend to antifa rallies i mean this guy looks like a caricature
[1:48:51.680 --> 1:48:56.560]  of what you might think a teacher would be doing if he was an antifa
[1:48:56.560 --> 1:49:00.000]  probably one of the most shocking things we've ever seen come out of a school
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:04.800]  at least as far as i've seen and parents are outraged about this alex just
[1:49:04.800 --> 1:49:08.160]  sort of this just sort of broke an hour or two ago
[1:49:08.160 --> 1:49:11.840]  you have teachers and parents are outraged the principal is not happy
[1:49:11.840 --> 1:49:16.240]  about this in the school and i'm seeing reports on the
[1:49:16.240 --> 1:49:20.160]  facebook page for the school people are really upset
[1:49:20.160 --> 1:49:23.280]  we think this teacher will be fired we're looking for a reaction there's a
[1:49:23.280 --> 1:49:26.720]  school board meeting tomorrow the reason we do this uh
[1:49:26.720 --> 1:49:29.760]  aside from the importance of exposing this one individual is
[1:49:29.760 --> 1:49:33.200]  it's going to inspire a lot more people on the inside of these organizations
[1:49:33.200 --> 1:49:37.040]  and institutions to come to project veritas but alex maybe one of the most
[1:49:37.040 --> 1:49:41.040]  shocking things we've seen inside schools today released by project veritas
[1:49:41.040 --> 1:49:44.320]  it's amazing and for radio listeners they can't see it they've got to go to
[1:49:44.320 --> 1:49:48.160]  projectveritas.com and watch it or infowars.com but
[1:49:48.160 --> 1:49:51.360]  look at the images Mao say tongue on the wall
[1:49:51.360 --> 1:49:55.520]  uh antifa all this really dangerous communist stuff
[1:49:55.520 --> 1:49:58.560]  Mao obviously killed more people than Hitler and Stalin combined
[1:49:58.560 --> 1:50:02.400]  and then on his arm he's got ing sock
[1:50:02.400 --> 1:50:10.000]  tattooed from 1984 the fictitious evil overlord party that kills everybody
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:15.840]  i mean this guy is so creepy he read 1984 and he thinks it's a utopian novel
[1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:21.280]  yeah most people i mean yes yes that's a very astute observation most people
[1:50:21.280 --> 1:50:27.200]  who read 1984 uh it's they're critical of of that dystopia
[1:50:27.200 --> 1:50:31.200]  they don't want the world to be that way but this man actually
[1:50:31.200 --> 1:50:37.280]  wants it to be 1984 so we did confront him also alex in the end of this video
[1:50:37.280 --> 1:50:42.160]  we we we found him in california opened microphone and said what are you doing
[1:50:42.160 --> 1:50:46.880]  and he claimed that we were quote harassing him and he was wearing orange
[1:50:46.880 --> 1:50:50.640]  glasses he had a hammer and sickle shirt on his wearing the shirt
[1:50:50.640 --> 1:50:55.440]  so we put that out as well uh school board meeting tomorrow project veritas
[1:50:55.440 --> 1:50:57.520]  will be attending the school school board meeting
[1:50:57.520 --> 1:51:00.800]  people are outraged the principal is not happy
[1:51:00.800 --> 1:51:04.640]  about this and uh i think he this this man is going to become the face of
[1:51:04.640 --> 1:51:09.120]  public education in california unless something is done about him
[1:51:09.120 --> 1:51:12.000]  alex and there you have it that's that's him being confronted he says quote
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:15.680]  i don't feel comfortable with this which is ironic because he says in the
[1:51:15.680 --> 1:51:18.880]  undercover recording that his that he wants people to feel
[1:51:18.880 --> 1:51:22.640]  uncomfortable in his classroom you can't make it up alex
[1:51:22.640 --> 1:51:26.400]  well that's what these bullies do they go out attack prayer meetings
[1:51:26.400 --> 1:51:33.120]  they go to salons where women in the club don't want men in the hot tub with
[1:51:33.120 --> 1:51:37.280]  them in the ladies room and they go and beat people up and and they want to
[1:51:37.280 --> 1:51:40.640]  attack us and stop our speech but then when you talk to them they're like i'm
[1:51:40.640 --> 1:51:44.640]  being harassed i want to call the police you're being mean to me
[1:51:44.640 --> 1:51:48.560]  well that's the example of george orwell's what we call double think
[1:51:48.560 --> 1:51:52.480]  that's that's the double think in 1984 to tell deliberate lies while genuinely
[1:51:52.480 --> 1:51:55.200]  believing them to forget any fact that has become
[1:51:55.200 --> 1:51:58.400]  inconvenient and then it becomes necessary to draw it back back from
[1:51:58.400 --> 1:52:02.160]  oblivion for just so long it is as needed to deny the existence of objective
[1:52:02.160 --> 1:52:06.720]  reality and to take account of the reality which one denies that's what
[1:52:06.720 --> 1:52:10.480]  george orwell wrote in 1984 to to have this teacher
[1:52:10.480 --> 1:52:13.680]  quite literally saying in the video that we recorded him in the coffee shop
[1:52:13.680 --> 1:52:16.480]  there in california but i want to make my students feel
[1:52:16.480 --> 1:52:20.720]  uncomfortable if they don't like antifa will screw them
[1:52:20.720 --> 1:52:23.200]  and then to have him tell our journalist well you're making me feel
[1:52:23.200 --> 1:52:26.560]  uncomfortable it's kind of a psychological illness
[1:52:26.560 --> 1:52:30.640]  it's it's a sign of mental illness and
[1:52:30.640 --> 1:52:34.320]  clearly that's that's what we're dealing with here to a certain extent to have
[1:52:34.320 --> 1:52:37.760]  someone you know believe these ideologies
[1:52:37.760 --> 1:52:42.080]  and contradict themselves so clearly i'm really looking forward to seeing alex
[1:52:42.080 --> 1:52:45.120]  the reaction from the school district i know there will be a reaction
[1:52:45.120 --> 1:52:49.920]  in the next few hours so all i can say is stay tuned for that to happen
[1:52:49.920 --> 1:52:55.920]  and of course this rat-like creature thinks that the there it is on video
[1:52:55.920 --> 1:53:01.040]  he thinks that he is going to get this big great job in the future communist
[1:53:01.040 --> 1:53:05.280]  utopia and he's so ignorant he's got a 1984 tattoo on
[1:53:05.280 --> 1:53:08.560]  his arm thinking that's a good thing i mean i mean like you said this is just
[1:53:08.560 --> 1:53:12.080]  pure mental illness and these guys are laughing
[1:53:12.080 --> 1:53:15.600]  like there's wonder well no i mean you're absolutely right it is funny
[1:53:15.600 --> 1:53:19.600]  in a sick way it is the insoc tattoo is on
[1:53:19.600 --> 1:53:25.520]  it's unbelievable and again this is something he said
[1:53:25.520 --> 1:53:30.720]  um why aren't people just taking up arms taking up arms against the state
[1:53:30.720 --> 1:53:34.320]  crushed and being martyrs for the cause turning my student giving
[1:53:34.320 --> 1:53:37.840]  students extra credit he's giving them credit
[1:53:37.840 --> 1:53:41.760]  for going to antifa rallies these are your taxpayer dollars at work
[1:53:41.760 --> 1:53:47.280]  and you know i hear you you ask what's next for project veritas i alex i can't
[1:53:47.280 --> 1:53:51.200]  you wouldn't believe how many people are reaching out to project veritas on the
[1:53:51.200 --> 1:53:54.320]  inside of everywhere pharmaceutical companies
[1:53:54.320 --> 1:53:59.040]  disney uh government institutions federal government people are pissed
[1:53:59.040 --> 1:54:02.800]  people have had enough and there's a lot going on the world right now
[1:54:02.800 --> 1:54:07.760]  overseas here um there's a lot of news happening
[1:54:07.760 --> 1:54:12.080]  every day but the good news is the silver lining is people are really waking up
[1:54:12.080 --> 1:54:15.520]  and they want to do something about it we wouldn't know about this man
[1:54:15.520 --> 1:54:19.760]  this uh gabriel guy public high school teacher in sacramento california
[1:54:19.760 --> 1:54:22.960]  but not for someone on the inside of that class from reaching out to us
[1:54:22.960 --> 1:54:26.720]  and taking pictures so there is a lot of evil in the world and there's a lot of
[1:54:26.720 --> 1:54:29.760]  sick people in the world but there's also a lot of good people in the world
[1:54:29.760 --> 1:54:32.800]  who are finally doing something about the problems
[1:54:32.800 --> 1:54:38.000]  at veritas we have dozens of reporters with cameras now
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:40.640]  you can go out and corroborate the information like you're seeing and
[1:54:40.640 --> 1:54:43.280]  hearing right now we went out to california we met with this man in a
[1:54:43.280 --> 1:54:46.320]  coffee shop we got him to admit what he's doing
[1:54:46.320 --> 1:54:50.480]  so i i know um i know people are really cynical and upset about what's happening
[1:54:50.480 --> 1:54:53.760]  in this country but um i guarantee you that every
[1:54:53.760 --> 1:54:56.480]  week veritas will be releasing another bombshell
[1:54:56.480 --> 1:54:59.840]  bigger and bigger also on the vaccine and coven working on that as well and we'll
[1:54:59.840 --> 1:55:02.400]  have some information for you shortly about that
[1:55:02.400 --> 1:55:06.640]  well absolutely this is a huge story i just know you've always got so much
[1:55:06.640 --> 1:55:08.880]  incredible stuff coming so now you really
[1:55:08.880 --> 1:55:14.000]  wet my appetite um on the vaccine give us a little hint what you got cooking
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:18.080]  well i think i think we've been we've had some people reach out to us within
[1:55:18.080 --> 1:55:21.600]  pharmaceutical companies um within the federal government with some of these
[1:55:21.600 --> 1:55:24.640]  agencies and they're upset about what's happening a lot of people were refusing
[1:55:24.640 --> 1:55:29.360]  to be vaccinated um but you saw what we exposed with cnn and
[1:55:29.360 --> 1:55:32.240]  the charlie chestertate back in april where they admitted they wanted more
[1:55:32.240 --> 1:55:36.720]  people to die to get more ratings yes so i think it's important for us to
[1:55:36.720 --> 1:55:42.800]  expose the real motivation behind why uh they're pushing this on us in places
[1:55:42.800 --> 1:55:45.120]  like new york where i'm in new york state
[1:55:45.120 --> 1:55:50.240]  september 13th new york city is requiring uh you have a passport card to
[1:55:50.240 --> 1:55:53.120]  get into restaurants and a lot of people are not
[1:55:53.120 --> 1:55:56.720]  going to want to be vaccinated so i think it's going to be a very interesting
[1:55:56.720 --> 1:55:59.760]  few weeks i can't tell you exactly what we're doing but
[1:55:59.760 --> 1:56:03.440]  what i can tell you is that people on the inside of these pharmaceutical
[1:56:03.440 --> 1:56:07.520]  companies and federal government agencies that are effectively requiring
[1:56:07.520 --> 1:56:11.920]  all this to happen are reaching out to me with stories to tell
[1:56:11.920 --> 1:56:15.680]  so if you're watching this program what i would like you to do
[1:56:15.680 --> 1:56:19.280]  is to reach out to us if you're on the inside of these companies i know you're
[1:56:19.280 --> 1:56:23.600]  out there alex your audience you you have people watching info wars that
[1:56:23.600 --> 1:56:27.120]  work for the federal government that work for pharmaceutical companies

[1:56:42.720 --> 1:56:47.120]  we would love for you to contact us we absolutely project veritas.com if they

[1:56:54.560 --> 1:56:57.920]  to again i believe in vaccines if they're real and clean this doesn't work
[1:56:57.920 --> 1:57:01.600]  it's making people sick i think trump needs to wake up to that but you know
[1:57:01.600 --> 1:57:03.680]  regardless he's not the president right now we've got
[1:57:03.680 --> 1:57:07.680]  the puppet biden just in 30 second closing you think biden survives to the
[1:57:07.680 --> 1:57:12.400]  end of the year or do you think they do the 25th amendment
[1:57:12.400 --> 1:57:16.880]  i that's the question hard for me to predict that one
[1:57:16.880 --> 1:57:20.560]  i mean he's there's a there's enough out there already to to damage him
[1:57:20.560 --> 1:57:24.080]  politically but my prediction is i don't know if he
[1:57:24.080 --> 1:57:26.240]  makes it i don't know if he makes it the full term
[1:57:26.240 --> 1:57:29.200]  he's struggling so much i don't think he makes it a full term but i think he's
[1:57:29.200 --> 1:57:32.560]  like an undead zombie i think he'll crawl into 2022 i agree with you
[1:57:32.560 --> 1:57:35.600]  all right james oakie amazing job project veritas

[2:00:19.200 --> 2:00:23.520]  cast 22 amy in new york says two family members took
[2:00:23.520 --> 2:00:27.120]  vacs both have cancer now yeah like roger stone's wife and so many
[2:00:27.120 --> 2:00:30.240]  others they even say oh you might get cancer but it's no big deal
[2:00:30.240 --> 2:00:34.000]  uh wow i'm sorry to hear that amy tell us what's happened up there in new york
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:37.680]  hey alex thanks for taking my call i'm actually know three people
[2:00:37.680 --> 2:00:42.800]  um two of them are family members they're both women under the age of 45
[2:00:42.800 --> 2:00:48.320]  both have young children um i obviously i'm not a scientist or a doctor
[2:00:48.320 --> 2:00:51.680]  i couldn't say that i definitely know but i'm pretty intuitive
[2:00:51.680 --> 2:00:55.360]  and i just have that feeling like there's no such thing as coincidence and i
[2:00:55.360 --> 2:00:58.480]  feel like that's why they try to teach us that two plus two equals five
[2:00:58.480 --> 2:01:02.880]  they don't want us to make tons of things but i'm not stupid
[2:01:02.880 --> 2:01:06.480]  i know for a fact that there's no such thing as coincidence
[2:01:06.480 --> 2:01:11.440]  and well ma'am i mean they admit that that it's causing lymphoma cancer lung
[2:01:11.440 --> 2:01:17.040]  cancer a cervical cancer ovarian cancer uterine cancer
[2:01:17.040 --> 2:01:20.560]  all sorts of other stuff i mean i mean they say it actually may trigger it
[2:01:20.560 --> 2:01:25.760]  that's a side effect uh so so what type of cancers did they get
[2:01:25.760 --> 2:01:30.880]  so my sister in law she had blood work back in February and everything was fine
[2:01:30.880 --> 2:01:36.000]  and between then got both jabs and now she has stage four
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:40.080]  um and metastasized turn liver they're not even a hundred percent sure
[2:01:40.080 --> 2:01:44.000]  really where it all originated my cousin
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:47.600]  she has she just got diagnosed with not Hodgkin
[2:01:47.600 --> 2:01:51.200]  lymphoma and i was listening to lymph nodes that's the main ones the lymph nodes
[2:01:51.200 --> 2:01:54.960]  yep yeah i was listening to your show the other day and forgive me for not
[2:01:54.960 --> 2:01:58.240]  knowing the doctor's name but when she was speaking i just had that feeling
[2:01:58.240 --> 2:02:01.600]  like this is what happened like i just knew and i know that no doctor is
[2:02:01.600 --> 2:02:05.200]  going to say that i've talked to some nurses you know they
[2:02:05.200 --> 2:02:07.760]  they think they're doing the right thing so i can't even knock anybody
[2:02:07.760 --> 2:02:10.720]  and and see they'll won't admit as the cancer
[2:02:10.720 --> 2:02:12.960]  triples that they did it because they won't admit
[2:02:12.960 --> 2:02:17.120]  their heroes so they can and of course they'll get the shots and die too i mean
[2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:21.760]  that they just can't help themselves right but because this is so like
[2:02:21.760 --> 2:02:24.880]  you know the the mainstream media is what people see first and
[2:02:24.880 --> 2:02:27.840]  have the people you know they're even trying to fully listen to a show like
[2:02:27.840 --> 2:02:31.360]  yours um so they don't really get the message plus
[2:02:31.360 --> 2:02:35.200]  you know your name's been smeared for at least the last 10 years that i've
[2:02:35.200 --> 2:02:39.360]  heard your name well amy i'm just glad you told to
[2:02:39.360 --> 2:02:42.640]  tell your testimony and hopefully people will take this show today and share it
[2:02:42.640 --> 2:02:46.560]  and share this clip and save some lives so keep warning people and god bless
[2:02:46.560 --> 2:02:48.400]  you and i'm sorry for your friend's troubles
[2:02:48.400 --> 2:02:52.000]  yeah these people are monsters uh let's talk to
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:56.720]  kaleb in texas has an ivermectin story kaleb go ahead
[2:02:56.720 --> 2:03:01.040]  hey alice i called in about uh basically saving my aunt from the health care
[2:03:01.040 --> 2:03:04.080]  system with ivermectin i had to drive two states to do it but
[2:03:04.080 --> 2:03:06.960]  brother while i was on hold i got inspired by something i just got to
[2:03:06.960 --> 2:03:09.840]  share it man and pray that it reaches a few people
[2:03:09.840 --> 2:03:13.680]  under bush senior was bad clinton was bad bush junior was bad but it was
[2:03:13.680 --> 2:03:18.960]  particularly under obama that we saw the new tactic of the cascade of scandals
[2:03:18.960 --> 2:03:22.320]  nothing ever gets done about one scandal because they just roll into the next
[2:03:22.320 --> 2:03:26.720]  one and we've got to pick our hill to stand on until we see justice
[2:03:26.720 --> 2:03:31.440]  and i think that hill is the ivermectin and cobin if you go to the national
[2:03:31.440 --> 2:03:35.920]  institute of health website in a nyh.gov they have a search bar and that
[2:03:35.920 --> 2:03:40.640]  search bar typed in ivermectin comma covid and you get paper after paper
[2:03:40.640 --> 2:03:44.960]  after paper of how ridiculously safe and how ridiculously effective ivermectin
[2:03:44.960 --> 2:03:48.800]  uh and the very same institution lies and says it isn't because they want
[2:03:48.800 --> 2:03:52.000]  high death rates because they're a bunch of ghouls and i meant to start the show
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:56.320]  with what you just said today the forced inoculations in the medical
[2:03:56.320 --> 2:03:59.520]  tyranny is everything they want to distract us with all the other scandals
[2:03:59.520 --> 2:04:03.680]  this is the big one this is what they're rolling out their global id
[2:04:03.680 --> 2:04:07.520]  their control system this is it and we cannot get distracted by it by the other
[2:04:07.520 --> 2:04:11.600]  uh other scandals you notice we barely been covering afghanistan you notice
[2:04:11.600 --> 2:04:15.600]  that right yep we gotta pick our hill and we gotta do it man
[2:04:15.600 --> 2:04:18.320]  and if we're the only ones doing it right then we just need to keep doing it
[2:04:18.320 --> 2:04:21.040]  right and and and they tell me the ivermectin story
[2:04:21.040 --> 2:04:26.400]  real quick uh it's my aunt is several states away uh she got the she finally
[2:04:26.400 --> 2:04:30.640]  got talked into getting the covid jab she was immediately sick with covid uh
[2:04:30.640 --> 2:04:34.480]  was sick for four days got got tested positive for covid
[2:04:34.480 --> 2:04:37.680]  she didn't want nothing to do with the hospital because she knew that they got
[2:04:37.680 --> 2:04:40.960]  her she just knew she shouldn't have got the shot and that they got her and i
[2:04:40.960 --> 2:04:45.360]  drove the two states away with horse pace when i got there her pull socks was
[2:04:45.360 --> 2:04:48.640]  90 it took her three days she's a hundred percent better

[2:07:24.720 --> 2:07:28.640]  people said oh she's alarmist but now you've seen she was dead on she's been
[2:07:28.640 --> 2:07:32.960]  vindicated yet again so dr thank you for joining us it's great to have you
[2:07:32.960 --> 2:07:36.000]  here during these insane times where now they said they want to have shots
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:39.680]  every five months to leave our houses and it's all run by the Rockefeller
[2:07:39.680 --> 2:07:43.600]  Foundation world IDs are being announced we have videos of
[2:07:43.600 --> 2:07:47.680]  police dogs tearing people's faces off in the uk for being outside and
[2:07:47.680 --> 2:07:50.960]  police running people over with cars and horses in australia and
[2:07:50.960 --> 2:07:55.040]  germany i mean this is just a worldwide tyranny
[2:07:55.040 --> 2:07:58.720]  and i know you've been on the inside and blew the whistle about it so please
[2:07:58.720 --> 2:08:02.000]  give us your first big picture take and then take us wherever you want to go
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:07.600]  thanks for joining us thanks alice well the first big picture take is really
[2:08:07.600 --> 2:08:13.440]  that our book ending plague is dr russetti's the
[2:08:13.440 --> 2:08:17.040]  first time he's talked in 40 years about Fauci
[2:08:17.040 --> 2:08:23.280]  gallo and this plague of corruption that has really gripped our country for
[2:08:23.280 --> 2:08:27.200]  more than 40 years killing innocent people starting with hiv
[2:08:27.200 --> 2:08:31.680]  aids and we see this scenario in the same game plan
[2:08:31.680 --> 2:08:35.280]  play out over and over again i don't care whether it's um
[2:08:35.280 --> 2:08:42.880]  ebola in 2014 zika in 17 we all have known and we've known since my first
[2:08:42.880 --> 2:08:49.280]  interaction uh with tony Fauci um in 1984 when he then
[2:08:49.280 --> 2:08:54.240]  took luke montanier's isolation and discovery of hiv and its
[2:08:54.240 --> 2:08:58.960]  association uh with aids and he corrupted that
[2:08:58.960 --> 2:09:04.560]  to take away the testing so that um so that the testing didn't get to the
[2:09:04.560 --> 2:09:08.720]  victims um and the most susceptible communities for decades
[2:09:08.720 --> 2:09:12.640]  and as you'll see in our latest book in fact the
[2:09:12.640 --> 2:09:18.720]  misogyny i guess i'll call it or the um discrimination against women children
[2:09:18.720 --> 2:09:25.280]  denied treatment for um any of these um uh diseases
[2:09:25.280 --> 2:09:29.520]  being marginalized called chronic fatigue syndrome when in fact what we now
[2:09:29.520 --> 2:09:35.280]  know um is that the um that the animal contaminants that
[2:09:35.280 --> 2:09:40.160]  have contaminated the blood supply um for more than um for
[2:09:40.160 --> 2:09:44.480]  more than 40 years um and have contaminated vaccines so the whole
[2:09:44.480 --> 2:09:51.200]  idea is you can't grow viruses the antigens for viral vaccines in animal
[2:09:51.200 --> 2:09:56.240]  cell lines and direct them directly and inject them directly into
[2:09:56.240 --> 2:10:03.200]  people without um causing damage so the important part of where um
[2:10:03.200 --> 2:10:06.800]  the good news about all of this and i heard your last two
[2:10:06.800 --> 2:10:12.880]  callers about the cancer um and that is our expertise these viruses cause
[2:10:12.880 --> 2:10:18.640]  cancer they're associated with cancer the x m r v's that we discovered um
[2:10:18.640 --> 2:10:24.160]  have a protein called syncytine and syncytine is the envelope or part of
[2:10:24.160 --> 2:10:30.560]  the spike protein that has been engineered into sars cove two into
[2:10:30.560 --> 2:10:34.240]  this vaccine again sars cove two never caused
[2:10:34.240 --> 2:10:39.280]  covid it was always injected in animal cell lines like the
[2:10:39.280 --> 2:10:44.480]  vero monkey kidney cell line where we grow our polio vaccines the polio
[2:10:44.480 --> 2:10:49.840]  virus for our vaccines um and um in the flu vaccines as we
[2:10:49.840 --> 2:10:54.160]  knew in january 2020 from a very large study by greg
[2:10:54.160 --> 2:10:58.640]  wolf that showed if um if you got the flu vaccine uh
[2:10:58.640 --> 2:11:05.360]  in 2017 through 18 you were 36 more percent more likely to be diagnosed
[2:11:05.360 --> 2:11:10.480]  with covid so these vaccines are not vaccines they're
[2:11:10.480 --> 2:11:17.440]  chemotherapy they're gene therapy uh and and in fact um the intention
[2:11:17.440 --> 2:11:23.440]  of fauci and the top levels of the nih which is fully revealed in our book
[2:11:23.440 --> 2:11:27.920]  ending plague a scholar's obligation in an age of corruption
[2:11:27.920 --> 2:11:33.520]  the intention is to murder the tens of millions of people worldwide who are
[2:11:33.520 --> 2:11:38.880]  infected with hiv x mrvs from their contaminated vaccines
[2:11:38.880 --> 2:11:44.080]  berelia babesia you know the chronic Lyme disease the explosion
[2:11:44.080 --> 2:11:50.000]  of autoimmune disease parkinson's disease al s this can all be attributed
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:55.520]  to the contaminants and not just the viruses um but glyphosate as we know
[2:11:55.520 --> 2:11:59.840]  from our friend dr stephanie senif but the the great news is
[2:11:59.840 --> 2:12:04.240]  their solutions and ivermectin is potently
[2:12:04.240 --> 2:12:12.560]  anti-cancer and yes they are causing the cancer the mlvs or the x mrvs
[2:12:12.560 --> 2:12:19.200]  mean murine leukemia causing viruses murine leukemia viruses you change
[2:12:19.200 --> 2:12:22.960]  doctor walk us through this because there's literally thousands of ap
[2:12:22.960 --> 2:12:25.920]  royers even new york times are like hey if you take the
[2:12:25.920 --> 2:12:30.240]  moderner fizer you're going to think you have cancer in the lymph nodes and in
[2:12:30.240 --> 2:12:34.240]  your uterus but it's no big deal and in your breasts and other areas it's no
[2:12:34.240 --> 2:12:38.080]  big deal doctors if it looks like cancer just don't treat it for six months
[2:12:38.080 --> 2:12:40.720]  well then i mean roger stone's wife got the fizer
[2:12:40.720 --> 2:12:43.840]  within a month a huge tumor grew under her arm stage four
[2:12:43.840 --> 2:12:48.000]  lymphoma non-hodgkins and and so you were warning of this year and a half ago
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:51.920]  here it is and now i've talked to the oncology wards and others they just say
[2:12:51.920 --> 2:12:55.520]  they're full of exploding cancers of the people that took it so fauci
[2:12:55.520 --> 2:12:59.920]  knew this is super bold explain what this so-called shot is doing
[2:12:59.920 --> 2:13:03.600]  and and why in the i've seen the my studies at ut he funded
[2:13:03.600 --> 2:13:06.960]  in 2012 where it caused not just blood clots but cancers
[2:13:06.960 --> 2:13:10.800]  and the scientist said don't use this as a human vaccine he then runs out and
[2:13:10.800 --> 2:13:14.560]  gets it and uses it i mean i'm no top scientist that work with him like you
[2:13:14.560 --> 2:13:18.560]  but i mean this is just totally premeditated
[2:13:18.560 --> 2:13:22.960]  correct because i led the lab of anti-viral drug mechanisms
[2:13:22.960 --> 2:13:29.680]  in 1999 through 2001 and before going to direct
[2:13:29.680 --> 2:13:33.200]  epigenics pharmaceuticals cancer biology program
[2:13:33.200 --> 2:13:36.000]  where we knew these mechanisms right then and there
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:41.760]  you express the envelope the spike protein of a murine lukemia virus related
[2:13:41.760 --> 2:13:46.400]  virus x mrv or our own gamma retrovirus known as herv
[2:13:46.400 --> 2:13:52.480]  w human endogenous retrovirus w you're injecting the envelope protein
[2:13:52.480 --> 2:13:57.680]  the envelope protein alone that our colleagues the resettis have known
[2:13:57.680 --> 2:14:02.080]  and their research back at the national cancer institute start my days there
[2:14:02.080 --> 2:14:08.080]  started june 10th 1980 so for 20 years we knew
[2:14:08.080 --> 2:14:12.000]  expression of sincitin the envelope protein alone
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:18.320]  cause cancer that is in the spike protein of these vaccines you are
[2:14:18.320 --> 2:14:22.960]  in you are injecting the blueprint to drive cancer
[2:14:22.960 --> 2:14:27.840]  and we see and we know it and we seen it and in fact
[2:14:27.840 --> 2:14:31.600]  unfortunately my own daughter-in-law was killed
[2:14:31.600 --> 2:14:36.960]  let them and died two weeks ago from a cancer she was diagnosed with
[2:14:36.960 --> 2:14:41.600]  in in april of 2020 and i can say you can't kill
[2:14:41.600 --> 2:14:47.360]  a healthy 40 year old woman faster than the oncologist killed her
[2:14:47.360 --> 2:14:53.440]  here in la and they refused for months to give her
[2:14:53.440 --> 2:14:57.600]  ivermectin i've i sent them dozens of paper
[2:14:57.600 --> 2:15:04.640]  show papers showing ivermectin is anti-cancer anti-matastasis
[2:15:04.640 --> 2:15:08.480]  we understand the syncytia are fused
[2:15:08.480 --> 2:15:14.080]  cells what is a tumor fused clumps of cells what is a blood clot fused red
[2:15:14.080 --> 2:15:20.800]  blood cells sincitin is velcro it causes fusion of
[2:15:20.800 --> 2:15:28.480]  cells we've known that fact for 40 years doctor all i know is i know a
[2:15:28.480 --> 2:15:32.480]  bunch of young people like you said 30 40 50 that's you know young i'm almost
[2:15:32.480 --> 2:15:34.800]  50 they take it and suddenly get cancered a
[2:15:34.800 --> 2:15:38.560]  month later i mean this and then they say oh it can give you tumors no big deal
[2:15:38.560 --> 2:15:42.320]  don't worry about those tumors i mean this and they this is insane
[2:15:42.320 --> 2:15:45.680]  and in the rat studies as you know that yeah they got tumors as well
[2:15:45.680 --> 2:15:49.360]  so i'm gonna ask you doctor where this is all going we'll talk about your book
[2:15:49.360 --> 2:15:52.320]  and so much more leading scientist whistleblower
[2:15:52.320 --> 2:15:56.480]  joins us live everything she predicted now coming true

[2:18:01.200 --> 2:18:04.240]  against the globalist i wanted to stop their agenda
[2:18:04.240 --> 2:18:08.000]  i wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks
[2:18:08.000 --> 2:18:12.480]  before they went operational but we failed yes a lot of people are awake
[2:18:12.480 --> 2:18:15.680]  yes we're not getting caught flat footed but they are going
[2:18:15.680 --> 2:18:19.440]  ahead with their full operational deindustrialization
[2:18:19.440 --> 2:18:23.360]  great reset and that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and
[2:18:23.360 --> 2:18:26.320]  all listeners tell everybody they know about the show

[2:20:00.480 --> 2:20:05.200]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:10.880 --> 2:20:17.680]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[2:20:17.680 --> 2:20:25.120]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex
[2:20:25.120 --> 2:20:27.920]  jones you know i've talked to so many medical
[2:20:27.920 --> 2:20:31.920]  doctors that are on air also off air
[2:20:31.920 --> 2:20:35.440]  the thing that really woke them up was the suppression of hydroxychloroquine
[2:20:35.440 --> 2:20:38.240]  ivermectin because they could go read all the
[2:20:38.240 --> 2:20:41.440]  hundreds of mainline studies and the japanese studies and the us studies and
[2:20:41.440 --> 2:20:44.000]  the british studies and know that it's so you know
[2:20:44.000 --> 2:20:48.800]  good at stopping what what's happening and then to see the suppression of it
[2:20:48.800 --> 2:20:51.920]  so we have a major whistleblower dr judy a mikovitz
[2:20:51.920 --> 2:20:55.440]  she is the lady that first over a year and a half ago began exposing things
[2:20:55.440 --> 2:20:58.800]  she went up against Fauci he literally came after her
[2:20:58.800 --> 2:21:01.600]  she can go into the history if she wants or what's currently happening or what's
[2:21:01.600 --> 2:21:05.520]  going on but they've also got the new book ending plague
[2:21:05.520 --> 2:21:09.040]  a scholar's obligation an age of corruption everybody should get it
[2:21:09.040 --> 2:21:12.160]  right now plague the book dot com but this is a
[2:21:12.160 --> 2:21:14.960]  shorter segment long segments coming up than another segment
[2:21:14.960 --> 2:21:19.280]  every amount of time is so precious for those that don't know from the studies
[2:21:19.280 --> 2:21:22.880]  because you're not just a doctor you're a research scientist and virologist
[2:21:22.880 --> 2:21:27.920]  why does ivermectin work so good explain that in layman's terms so i can show
[2:21:27.920 --> 2:21:32.240]  japanese national press conferences and i can show you know oxford studies but
[2:21:32.240 --> 2:21:37.680]  why does it work so good um layman's terms is difficult but it
[2:21:37.680 --> 2:21:41.440]  works so well because it works on your immune system
[2:21:41.440 --> 2:21:47.120]  it's not directly an anti parasite it doesn't just kill bugs in a test tube
[2:21:47.120 --> 2:21:52.560]  it tells your immune system how to restore ballast your functional adaptive
[2:21:52.560 --> 2:21:56.480]  t-cell immune response so when we inject
[2:21:56.480 --> 2:22:02.400]  you know a pathogen um in directly into the blood you bypass your type one your
[2:22:02.400 --> 2:22:05.840]  innate immune responses type one interferons
[2:22:05.840 --> 2:22:12.560]  glutathione um things that normally just um gobble up in RNA viruses just like a
[2:22:12.560 --> 2:22:16.080]  pacman gobbles up RNA viruses when you inject it
[2:22:16.080 --> 2:22:19.600]  you're shifting to what we call a th2 a functional
[2:22:19.600 --> 2:22:22.720]  th2 response and the cytokines are very different
[2:22:22.720 --> 2:22:26.320]  so they shift away to where they're looking for parasites
[2:22:26.320 --> 2:22:30.800]  they're looking for worms helmets it's cytokines i l4 i l5 i l10
[2:22:30.800 --> 2:22:33.840]  i know that's not ordinary speak but by now
[2:22:33.840 --> 2:22:38.480]  physicians people everywhere know what a functional adaptive type 2
[2:22:38.480 --> 2:22:43.680]  t-cell response is so ivermectin allows you to shift back and say no no we've
[2:22:43.680 --> 2:22:48.080]  got this under control we've silenced any activated um
[2:22:48.080 --> 2:22:52.320]  fungal infections microbial infections and we're going to go back and direct
[2:22:52.320 --> 2:22:55.200]  all our immune tissue and all our immune response
[2:22:55.200 --> 2:23:00.480]  towards that the type one interfere on responses the innate immune responses
[2:23:00.480 --> 2:23:03.760]  that are right there at all of your mucosal surfaces
[2:23:03.760 --> 2:23:08.720]  and um this is it and it won the Nobel Prize in 2015
[2:23:08.720 --> 2:23:15.360]  for its broad antimicrobial um effects and and my whole career
[2:23:15.360 --> 2:23:19.760]  is how do viruses cause cancer by dysregulating the
[2:23:19.760 --> 2:23:23.120]  natural the innate and and adaptive immune response
[2:23:23.120 --> 2:23:27.600]  that was my phd thesis that ultimately changed the paradigm
[2:23:27.600 --> 2:23:31.600]  for treating hiv aids because they were targeting the t-cell they were
[2:23:31.600 --> 2:23:35.840]  targeting the functional type 2 responses and now let me throw this at
[2:23:35.840 --> 2:23:38.320]  you because i've seen the medical studies i've aired a bunch of clips of
[2:23:38.320 --> 2:23:41.200]  doctors but i'm ignorant i'm not a scientist like you
[2:23:41.200 --> 2:23:44.160]  why are they saying the thizer and modernists shots even their own people
[2:23:44.160 --> 2:23:48.960]  brag are turning off just one shot one third of the killer t's
[2:23:48.960 --> 2:23:53.920]  what's going on there well i can't tell you from a standpoint of data and
[2:23:53.920 --> 2:23:57.200]  that's all i speak to because i haven't been nobody's
[2:23:57.200 --> 2:24:03.040]  been privy to independent data and analysis of of the t-cell responses
[2:24:03.040 --> 2:24:07.440]  we do know that this is why we use ivermectin and hydroxychloric when
[2:24:07.440 --> 2:24:10.000]  they're subtly different as far as their mechanism
[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:13.600]  inism action but they restore the appropriate
[2:24:13.600 --> 2:24:17.520]  functional t-cell responses and i'll be doing i'll be
[2:24:17.520 --> 2:24:22.320]  giving a lecture on all of this on thursday september 2nd live
[2:24:22.320 --> 2:24:26.720]  in thousand oaks at god speak church where we'll be doing autism one
[2:24:26.720 --> 2:24:31.200]  because autism one the conference has been ahead of the curve the
[2:24:31.200 --> 2:24:35.280]  entire time showing how to treat these neuroimmune
[2:24:35.280 --> 2:24:38.320]  and and diseases and cancer and they're they're
[2:24:38.320 --> 2:24:42.640]  the same pathways this is why they have supplements like you just showed like
[2:24:42.640 --> 2:24:46.640]  your fabulous turmeric supplement like quercetin like these
[2:24:46.640 --> 2:24:50.480]  the foods the minerals were so depleted in minerals
[2:24:50.480 --> 2:24:55.040]  by the toxins in our soil so natural products this is
[2:24:55.040 --> 2:24:59.280]  the the big victory why your show is so important why the
[2:24:59.280 --> 2:25:03.680]  info wars and the supplement wars is we've won we don't care what tony
[2:25:03.680 --> 2:25:06.480]  falchi does anymore i was about to say you're saying the
[2:25:06.480 --> 2:25:09.200]  answer that's why they're so desperate and trying to block natural
[2:25:09.200 --> 2:25:12.560]  treatments is the answer is just information people discovering what's
[2:25:12.560 --> 2:25:14.480]  happening but but let me just ask you this
[2:25:14.480 --> 2:25:17.120]  you knew falchi you were the whistle he came after you they've had the
[2:25:17.120 --> 2:25:20.560]  international tv shows they tried to discredit you i looked up what you said
[2:25:20.560 --> 2:25:24.000]  about him he definitely did horrible stuff with hiv suppressed treatments
[2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:28.560]  like you said who's behind him and why is this little monster
[2:25:28.560 --> 2:25:32.880]  so politically bulletproof and obviously big pharma is launching this to try to
[2:25:32.880 --> 2:25:36.160]  take over society to bring in a global cashless system
[2:25:36.160 --> 2:25:40.240]  global ids world government i mean they admit this is their vehicle to total
[2:25:40.240 --> 2:25:45.040]  power i just can't believe they've gotten so many people in government on board
[2:25:45.040 --> 2:25:48.080]  well they've been on board forever who's behind him
[2:25:48.080 --> 2:25:53.200]  um robert redfield debber berks who um who destroyed the lives of our
[2:25:53.200 --> 2:25:57.680]  military testing their hiv vaccine back in the 90s
[2:25:57.680 --> 2:26:01.280]  got away with those crimes fabricating the literature
[2:26:01.280 --> 2:26:06.480]  you know everything about hiv aides um for the first 12 years
[2:26:06.480 --> 2:26:12.560]  was bob gallo and tony falchi led you know bob gallo was the one who
[2:26:12.560 --> 2:26:17.120]  created all of this and the two of them teamed up and that's what you'll read
[2:26:17.120 --> 2:26:20.560]  and and then convince then president ronald reagan
[2:26:20.560 --> 2:26:25.120]  um you know this uh this who got credit for hiv
[2:26:25.120 --> 2:26:28.320]  who got credit who got fame fortune and money
[2:26:28.320 --> 2:26:32.560]  for the diagnostic testing you know that was the fight between
[2:26:32.560 --> 2:26:37.600]  france and the united states he poisoned patients with azt as you're
[2:26:37.600 --> 2:26:42.160]  showing now using it at the wrong dose refusing um type one
[2:26:42.160 --> 2:26:46.560]  interferons refusing peptide t natural products all the
[2:26:46.560 --> 2:26:51.120]  subject of the movies the band played on in the dallas fires club this was
[2:26:51.120 --> 2:26:54.720]  my entire life and i didn't just come out a year ago
[2:26:54.720 --> 2:26:59.120]  this is the third book in a series that started when we realized
[2:26:59.120 --> 2:27:02.720]  the the gamma retroviruses the third family
[2:27:02.720 --> 2:27:06.560]  of human retroviruses diseases that were caused
[2:27:06.560 --> 2:27:12.720]  by the gain of function studies which continue and have always been going on
[2:27:12.720 --> 2:27:17.600]  um i did those studies at fort detrick this is really by a war plan before we
[2:27:17.600 --> 2:27:20.640]  come back to get into all that doctor and you got to come back sometime for a
[2:27:20.640 --> 2:27:23.200]  commercial free podcast those have millions of viewers as well and then
[2:27:23.200 --> 2:27:27.200]  you're not getting stopped by the radio ads that we have to run here but but
[2:27:27.200 --> 2:27:31.520]  just answer this for me on a scale of one to ten it seems as a layman
[2:27:31.520 --> 2:27:35.840]  that this new global rollout is a much more deadly shot that the level of
[2:27:35.840 --> 2:27:39.680]  death and disease and cancer just has escalated i mean i'm familiar with the
[2:27:39.680 --> 2:27:43.360]  experimental anthrax shots experimental hiv the carnage there everything you
[2:27:43.360 --> 2:27:47.840]  expose but am i right saying that it's just exponentially worse
[2:27:47.840 --> 2:27:51.760]  absolutely this is the three deadliest pandemics of our time
[2:27:51.760 --> 2:27:58.400]  hiv x mrv and sars all rolled into one shot all you need is the spike protein
[2:27:58.400 --> 2:28:02.640]  and it's that synthetic spike protein that is this deadly epidemics that
[2:28:02.640 --> 2:28:06.240]  affect 13 million americans that faucian and
[2:28:06.240 --> 2:28:10.080]  who every level of our government has covered up since
[2:28:10.080 --> 2:28:14.720]  since aids in the 80s and the true causes and the true solution so is this
[2:28:14.720 --> 2:28:18.480]  not the greatest crime ever committed against humanity billions injected
[2:28:18.480 --> 2:28:21.040]  which they admit has the hiv spike protein everything
[2:28:21.040 --> 2:28:26.400]  injected with this franken creature correct but the answer is simple
[2:28:26.400 --> 2:28:30.960]  not another shot ever and we concur it with everything you're talking about
[2:28:30.960 --> 2:28:35.120]  today and i am as well it's all in well stay there then i want to ask you doctor
[2:28:35.120 --> 2:28:38.640]  why do they want these boosters every five to six months i mean
[2:28:38.640 --> 2:28:42.640]  wow we're gonna come right back with dr judy a mikovitz
[2:28:42.640 --> 2:28:46.240]  plague the book dot com plague the book dot com get the book
[2:28:46.240 --> 2:28:50.400]  she is a fighter she has been persecuted she has been attacked she has been
[2:28:50.400 --> 2:28:56.400]  literally a political prisoner and she is vindicated we'll be right back
[2:28:56.400 --> 2:29:00.000]  if you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of
[2:29:00.000 --> 2:29:03.600]  off-grid electricity this will be the most important message
[2:29:03.600 --> 2:29:07.840]  you'll hear this year here's why we now have a small number of solar
[2:29:07.840 --> 2:29:11.920]  generators back in stock these emergency backup systems provide
[2:29:11.920 --> 2:29:14.880]  life-saving backup power when you need it most
[2:29:14.880 --> 2:29:18.480]  and unlike gas generators solar generators run quietly
[2:29:18.480 --> 2:29:22.080]  emit no dangerous fumes and produce an endless supply of
[2:29:22.080 --> 2:29:26.160]  free electricity from the sun whether it's wildfires dangerous whether power
[2:29:26.160 --> 2:29:28.560]  grid issues or just getting off the grid
[2:29:28.560 --> 2:29:32.560]  you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again
[2:29:32.560 --> 2:29:36.400]  even better all this week radio listeners get over 700 dollars
[2:29:36.400 --> 2:29:41.280]  in free off-the-grid bonuses too go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and
[2:29:41.280 --> 2:29:44.560]  check availability that's mysolarbackup.com
[2:29:44.560 --> 2:29:48.160]  look for the free report crisis cooling how to make absolutely sure

[2:29:57.360 --> 2:30:01.200]  i've been fighting as hard as i can for almost 28 years
[2:30:01.200 --> 2:30:04.240]  against the globalist i wanted to stop their agenda
[2:30:04.240 --> 2:30:08.080]  i wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks
[2:30:08.080 --> 2:30:12.560]  before they went operational but we failed yes a lot of people are awake
[2:30:12.560 --> 2:30:15.760]  yes we're not getting caught flat-footed but they are going
[2:30:15.760 --> 2:30:19.440]  ahead with their full operational deindustrialization
[2:30:19.440 --> 2:30:23.360]  great reset and that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and
[2:30:23.360 --> 2:30:26.320]  all listeners tell everybody they know about the show
[2:30:26.320 --> 2:30:29.280]  because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth
[2:30:29.280 --> 2:30:32.480]  so we've got an information warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda
[2:30:32.480 --> 2:30:35.520]  and we've also got to get personally prepared and one of the number one
[2:30:35.520 --> 2:30:38.400]  things to do is high quality storeable food we've got the best food
[2:30:38.400 --> 2:30:42.160]  ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com
[2:30:42.160 --> 2:30:45.920]  so whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets

[2:30:49.280 --> 2:30:52.640]  food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits

[2:30:57.440 --> 2:31:01.440]  humanity is the main stakeholder on this planet
[2:31:01.440 --> 2:31:04.160]  but the big corporations for a hundred years have told us that humans are bad
[2:31:04.160 --> 2:31:08.080]  and evil and it passports on the earth so that we begin to believe we're bad
[2:31:08.080 --> 2:31:11.840]  and we'll turn off our life force and let the eugenics-based globalists
[2:31:11.840 --> 2:31:14.800]  take control of the planet. If you go to Klaus Schwab the head of the
[2:31:14.800 --> 2:31:18.960]  Davos Group's own Wikipedia page he brags on there about how they're
[2:31:18.960 --> 2:31:22.960]  capturing democracy and taking over governments worldwide
[2:31:22.960 --> 2:31:25.600]  to set up a corporate dictatorship under the UN.
[2:31:25.600 --> 2:31:30.800]  They admit all of this they plan the lockdowns they release the viruses
[2:31:30.800 --> 2:31:34.480]  they think you're stupid and their plan is to slowly cut off
[2:31:34.480 --> 2:31:39.200]  the resources so they can dictate total social control over you and your lives
[2:31:39.200 --> 2:31:42.320]  that's how i was able to predict everything they did
[2:31:42.320 --> 2:31:47.760]  decades before they executed it word for word with total precision because they
[2:31:47.760 --> 2:31:51.520]  have a detailed battle plan we cover it live weekdays 11 a.m.

[2:33:21.920 --> 2:33:27.200]  house in the fourth hour after judy a mikovitz is our guest he worked in
[2:33:27.200 --> 2:33:32.240]  cancer research vaccine research fort detrick marenland nih cdc highest levels
[2:33:32.240 --> 2:33:36.320]  with fauci blew the whistle plague the book.com is the new book it's life and
[2:33:36.320 --> 2:33:40.080]  death to get the book and to read it and then share it with others
[2:33:40.080 --> 2:33:45.200]  and pandemic came out over a year ago i mean like 15 16 months ago and totally
[2:33:45.200 --> 2:33:48.720]  predicted what would then unfold and then of course
[2:33:48.720 --> 2:33:52.560]  she got demonized and attacked but now we're seeing a replay of everything
[2:33:52.560 --> 2:33:56.400]  that fauci and these criminal groups of eugenicists have done before but on a
[2:33:56.400 --> 2:33:59.520]  wider scale so you were cut off by the break you were saying i worked in fort

[2:34:03.600 --> 2:34:06.160]  and if you're a radio listener we're just putting mainstream news articles up
[2:34:06.160 --> 2:34:09.840]  about oh you get the shot you get cancer but it's no big deal at least covet
[2:34:09.840 --> 2:34:13.280]  doesn't get you and then so many people that i know in the hospital have taken
[2:34:13.280 --> 2:34:16.240]  the shot they say they have covet and they're trying to suppress those
[2:34:16.240 --> 2:34:20.000]  numbers you got the floor for the next 25 minutes till this hour is over please
[2:34:20.000 --> 2:34:24.560]  continue uh yeah so what i'm saying is they've used
[2:34:24.560 --> 2:34:31.440]  the same playbook and the same game plan for the last in my experience now
[2:34:31.440 --> 2:34:35.440]  the last 40 years so and and i first learned
[2:34:35.440 --> 2:34:39.200]  of the depths of the plague of corruption in 2011
[2:34:39.200 --> 2:34:43.120]  and that's the subject of our first book plague and we were actually going to
[2:34:43.120 --> 2:34:49.840]  talk to you alex in october of 2019 when our book plague of corruption
[2:34:49.840 --> 2:34:54.080]  was supposed to come out was supposed to publish and the publication of that was
[2:34:54.080 --> 2:35:01.360]  delayed um i'm not sure why but god as i used to say or like to say god has a
[2:35:01.360 --> 2:35:06.560]  sense of humor so it didn't publish until april 14th of 2020
[2:35:06.560 --> 2:35:10.640]  and it reads like prophecy and mickey willis's film
[2:35:10.640 --> 2:35:16.720]  pandemic was actually a promotional video for that book it was supposed to be a
[2:35:16.720 --> 2:35:21.440]  short promotional video as he said in the talk he met me a few years earlier we
[2:35:21.440 --> 2:35:24.960]  were taught my my friend we do we go into all of this in our book
[2:35:24.960 --> 2:35:31.600]  ending plague and show how really this is the big thing the censorship of the
[2:35:31.600 --> 2:35:36.160]  censorship of news the censorship of information the censorship of the fact
[2:35:36.160 --> 2:35:43.040]  that there are simple safe solutions to this that that and they played this
[2:35:43.040 --> 2:35:48.000]  exact same playbook you know so i disagree with you on subtle points
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:52.480]  you know these folks are stupid um they they play the same playbook over and
[2:35:52.480 --> 2:35:57.680]  over and over again as if we're all just going to sit there and take it and
[2:35:57.680 --> 2:36:02.560]  watch our families die as if there are no scientists with integrity
[2:36:02.560 --> 2:36:07.280]  that's what ending plague is about what is a scholar's obligation in an age of
[2:36:07.280 --> 2:36:11.600]  corruption not only to produce the knowledge to end human suffering which
[2:36:11.600 --> 2:36:16.720]  which a phd must do understand why something's not working there's a
[2:36:16.720 --> 2:36:22.640]  reason understand how to use a drug or a supplement or nutritional more
[2:36:22.640 --> 2:36:27.920]  favorably in susceptible populations this is what my entire life is natural
[2:36:27.920 --> 2:36:33.840]  products curing and preventing cancer so the hydroxychloroquine is a vaccine
[2:36:33.840 --> 2:36:36.640]  tony vouchi wrote it himself in a paper in
[2:36:36.640 --> 2:36:46.000]  twenty two thousand and five um tony vouchi wrote it himself again in 2015 hydroxychloroquine stopped
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:50.320]  the deadly ebola outbreak that tony vouchi
[2:36:50.320 --> 2:36:56.320]  released from fort detrick in the summer of 2014 as you were saying at the opening
[2:36:56.320 --> 2:37:00.960]  this show during the obama in administration to cover up the fact
[2:37:00.960 --> 2:37:07.280]  that um of the movie vaxed of the of the confection of the cdc employee
[2:37:07.280 --> 2:37:13.600]  william thompson who confessed that they'd cover up that m mr given to um
[2:37:13.600 --> 2:37:18.960]  little black um hispanic and native american boys boys of color before the
[2:37:18.960 --> 2:37:24.880]  year they were three years old literally giving m mr three rna
[2:37:24.880 --> 2:37:32.080]  viruses in a single vaccine giving that shot before the uh little black boys were
[2:37:32.080 --> 2:37:37.520]  three years old they had two to four times the more the risk of getting um
[2:37:37.520 --> 2:37:42.880]  autism of neurodeveloped disease cancer in their parents in the military
[2:37:42.880 --> 2:37:49.680]  hormone driven cancers we understood the mechanisms we knew the biomarkers
[2:37:49.680 --> 2:37:57.440]  they've covered them up forever and so the ebola that was released murdering 21 000 innocent
[2:37:57.440 --> 2:38:04.000]  people in c r leone um people of color um was released from fort detrick it was similar to
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:09.520]  and and they're not released into the air they're shipped in little vials in cell lines they're
[2:38:09.520 --> 2:38:15.680]  called vaccines they're fermented in in large fermenters this is what we described the nitty
[2:38:15.680 --> 2:38:24.000]  gritty details how the sausage is made you know that's what i do i make drugs i make natural
[2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:30.960]  products into therapies and yet the industry the oncology industry pushes these deadly drugs
[2:38:30.960 --> 2:38:36.880]  just as every other part of of the medical community and now let me just back you up
[2:38:36.880 --> 2:38:41.360]  because the rockefellers by the 20s i read this in mainline history books isolated that most cancer
[2:38:41.360 --> 2:38:46.000]  was being delivered by natural viruses so they got obsessed with that learned how to capture it
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:51.760]  even the movie jfk chose it down to orleans the cia was developing a whole lab how to give people
[2:38:51.760 --> 2:38:57.280]  cancer via vaccines uh you know i did a jack ruby uh and so this goes on and on this is something
[2:38:57.280 --> 2:39:02.960]  they're obsessed with and then for those that don't know in the 1960s even they would scientists
[2:39:02.960 --> 2:39:07.360]  would get on an airplane and i read this in mainline books and fly across the country to see a child
[2:39:07.360 --> 2:39:12.240]  with cancer now i go to the mall a third of the kids look like they're dying of cancer and i ask
[2:39:12.240 --> 2:39:17.360]  the parents yeah they got cancer so how did we go from none of our children having cancer to it
[2:39:17.360 --> 2:39:23.520]  being everywhere well it's viral is that correct uh well it's viral in microbial and we've injected
[2:39:23.520 --> 2:39:30.640]  these viruses because all liability was removed we've injected them in every single vaccines
[2:39:30.640 --> 2:39:37.840]  m m r we're injecting rna viruses we're injecting i can send you or provide for your listeners
[2:39:37.840 --> 2:39:45.520]  this slide shows um that show you that show you these these viruses deadly hiv relatives
[2:39:45.520 --> 2:39:52.160]  simian immune deficiency virus sp 40 this is what bobby kennedy's um brilliant forward in our book
[2:39:52.160 --> 2:39:59.040]  a plague of corruption discussed the 40 years the knowledge that we've injected this is infection
[2:39:59.040 --> 2:40:08.400]  and disease by injection the cancer has exploded as the schedule of the cdc has increased because
[2:40:08.400 --> 2:40:14.800]  no liability is there at all no liability no testing the informed consent action network
[2:40:14.800 --> 2:40:22.400]  and del big tree showed at the end of 2019 all of these dates are critical the end of 2019
[2:40:22.400 --> 2:40:27.520]  they got caught they got caught by the movies they got caught by children's health defense they got
[2:40:27.520 --> 2:40:32.480]  caught by many other heroes like brian i agree they were desperate and in 2019 they had that
[2:40:32.480 --> 2:40:40.160]  emergency un meeting on vaccines with the head vex of the who in switzerland and she says we've
[2:40:40.160 --> 2:40:45.120]  got a wobbly first line everybody's waking up we've got to suspend the vaccines and all our
[2:40:45.120 --> 2:40:51.040]  experts agreed and so they doubled down now with this correct and they created they fabricated it
[2:40:51.040 --> 2:40:55.680]  just like they fabricated so they they had no solution because they didn't have their deadly
[2:40:55.680 --> 2:41:03.840]  virus the ebola outbreak was stopped by a smart doctor using hydroxychloroquine in 2014 so it
[2:41:03.840 --> 2:41:11.440]  doesn't matter the variant ivermectin hydroxychloroquine quercetin zinc tumorica minerals amino acids
[2:41:11.440 --> 2:41:17.680]  this so glutathione vitamin c vitamin d the solutions are all there so america the world
[2:41:17.680 --> 2:41:23.760]  needs to wake up and and literally just put these criminals in jail but before that no more
[2:41:23.760 --> 2:41:32.720]  not another shot it's my body you will not inject anything i'm a lab worker 20 year i got infected

[2:42:10.560 --> 2:42:19.680]  wear a mask it's called hypoxia inducible factor one alpha it's a blowtorch on cancer so if everybody
[2:42:19.680 --> 2:42:27.520]  wants to end the plague of corruption once and for all stop listening to satan restore your faith

[2:45:00.160 --> 2:45:05.680]  basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely
[2:45:05.680 --> 2:45:10.400]  holding on to a job and i heard dr group on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got
[2:45:10.400 --> 2:45:15.360]  was the original survival shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you
[2:45:15.360 --> 2:45:18.960]  came out with that too you had you know with a deep burn source you know and i got really excited
[2:45:18.960 --> 2:45:24.480]  about that so i took it and man in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like
[2:45:24.480 --> 2:45:30.160]  my brain was enlightened you know i could think again i could connect with people again and over
[2:45:30.160 --> 2:45:35.280]  the course of the next couple of years i got my health back and i religiously take basically all

[2:47:20.240 --> 2:47:23.760]  southern california but she's going to join us for an hour commercial free
[2:47:24.480 --> 2:47:30.320]  podcast that goes so viral unintended with us uh sometime in the week of the six
[2:47:30.320 --> 2:47:36.320]  six dr. duty a miko vitz is our guest plague the book dot com the book comes out today
[2:47:36.320 --> 2:47:42.560]  it's in hard copy it the forward is my robert f kennedy jr who is such a great patriot as well
[2:47:43.360 --> 2:47:50.720]  and look i saw this a year and a half ago as a failure forward and then covering up their previous
[2:47:50.720 --> 2:47:54.720]  failures with a new even bigger power grab i'm concerned what the next big power grab is going
[2:47:54.720 --> 2:47:58.320]  to be and how they're going to cover up all the cancer and death well they they just manipulate
[2:47:58.320 --> 2:48:02.960]  the hospitals and uh and have them blame the quote unvaccinated but i have all the studies right
[2:48:02.960 --> 2:48:08.560]  here that it's the vaccinated are clearly shedding something off but but i like how your
[2:48:09.120 --> 2:48:14.640]  doctor talking about solutions like vitamin d like ivermectin like things like this
[2:48:15.760 --> 2:48:19.760]  that the system is fighting so hard to cover up and then on your side it's all the scientists
[2:48:19.760 --> 2:48:24.720]  and doctors and studies on their side it's rachel madow making fun of us i'm just really
[2:48:24.720 --> 2:48:28.400]  not even mad at rachel madow or the young turks and people attacking me by name
[2:48:28.400 --> 2:48:33.520]  saying i'm an evil demon tell me we'll take horse horse-paced i mean i really feel sorry for them
[2:48:33.520 --> 2:48:38.320]  that for money because you know everybody's been offered money to sell out and and promote this
[2:48:38.320 --> 2:48:44.000]  big pharma takeover that literally for a few pieces of silver they've done this and i agree with you
[2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:48.080]  there's no way they're going to get away with this this is what psychos always do in their corner
[2:48:48.080 --> 2:48:52.960]  they double down and i see the world really waking up and all my sorts to say the same thing
[2:48:52.960 --> 2:48:58.080]  i think that this is going to blow up in their face what do you think absolutely and my passion
[2:48:58.080 --> 2:49:04.400]  is to educate those doctors those those oncologists that sat in there and said oh no we tested she
[2:49:04.400 --> 2:49:08.400]  doesn't have a but you don't do the test look at the immune system she doesn't have a parasitic
[2:49:08.400 --> 2:49:14.480]  infection we won't use ivermectin you know we'll just keep giving her chemotherapy um you know i'm
[2:49:14.480 --> 2:49:21.680]  i forgive them and um you know what what i'm trying to do in my world is learn to learn to
[2:49:21.680 --> 2:49:28.480]  find a way to explain this because to wake up these hardcore people who have been indoctornated
[2:49:28.480 --> 2:49:36.000]  that's why the second part of pandemic indoctrination which aired with david martin and and mickey
[2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:43.600]  willis august 18th of 2020 that's why that was so important he they walk you through how we as a
[2:49:43.600 --> 2:49:50.880]  country as a nation as a world have been fooled and what we have to do right now is every one of us
[2:49:50.880 --> 2:49:58.800]  wake up speak the truth in love and and teach teach the doctors we we uh we didn't make a mistake
[2:49:58.800 --> 2:50:04.240]  you know this this and and and the the reason i say we didn't make a mistake because we knew
[2:50:04.240 --> 2:50:10.000]  we knew the spike alone causes disease that's what we were told all the way through 2020
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:17.040]  so why were we so foolish as to allow someone to inject the spike protein as synthetic virus
[2:50:17.040 --> 2:50:22.640]  synthetic lipid nanobars it's a virus they injected you with billions of copy of a synthetic virus
[2:50:22.640 --> 2:50:30.320]  that can't be broken down by the immune system we can tell if you have vaccine covid do the correct
[2:50:30.320 --> 2:50:36.640]  pcr you will do the pcr looking only for the spike protein or look for antibodies you can do an
[2:50:36.640 --> 2:50:44.000]  antibody test proteins um um immunoblot look for the this spike protein alone you won't find the
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:49.760]  core of a coronavirus you won't find the structural proteins of a coronavirus that's right that's
[2:50:49.760 --> 2:50:54.720]  why these universities have never isolated a whole virus it's only the shell correct and but
[2:50:54.720 --> 2:50:59.280]  that's what you've injected so if you want to know if the people are sick in your hospitals
[2:50:59.280 --> 2:51:05.040]  with vaccine covid that was transmitted from a health care worker no health care worker wants
[2:51:05.040 --> 2:51:10.720]  to make their cancer patient sick and yet they're wearing a mask and blowing the particles on
[2:51:10.720 --> 2:51:15.680]  cancer patients in hospitals with totally compromised immune systems and killing them
[2:51:15.680 --> 2:51:21.440]  with fluid in the lungs you mentioned roger stone's wife in the lung cancer iver meccan's an answer
[2:51:21.440 --> 2:51:26.640]  call them up tell them iver meccan's an answer for her can we can the doctors won't even let
[2:51:26.640 --> 2:51:32.400]  him get near her it's incredible neither would the doctors let us near our daughter-in-law
[2:51:32.400 --> 2:51:39.360]  it's incredible they will not let you use a safe effective they're they wouldn't let us try
[2:51:39.360 --> 2:51:44.560]  they wouldn't let you the right to try but see when we say the doctors wouldn't let us near us
[2:51:44.560 --> 2:51:50.240]  then it's up to us no thank you don't go there so no i agree they keep acting like they're god so
[2:51:50.240 --> 2:51:54.720]  let's expand on this one hospital will give the iver meccan they have great success but the
[2:51:54.720 --> 2:51:59.200]  japanese exposed and then the next hospital won't so the good news is there are a lot of hospitals
[2:51:59.200 --> 2:52:03.840]  getting it but now we're learning they're persecuting doctors that actually do this i mean this is
[2:52:03.840 --> 2:52:11.360]  crazy correct so we have to get out of the system we have to encourage doctors to get out of their
[2:52:11.360 --> 2:52:17.600]  system and create our own no more health insurance no more money no more taxes no more
[2:52:17.600 --> 2:52:23.600]  free flu shot at bonds they're not free folks they're killing it now us they're destroying
[2:52:23.600 --> 2:52:31.840]  our country you know it's time if no one took another shot ever and they are all deadly every
[2:52:31.840 --> 2:52:40.720]  viral vaccine has coronaviruses every viral vaccine has recombinants of hiv siv x mrv every
[2:52:40.720 --> 2:52:47.920]  flu shot could be the last shot you get could kill you absolutely i know so many women that go on
[2:52:47.920 --> 2:52:53.440]  trips my wife's friends and stuff that would like go to vietnam or goes and take some vaccines in a
[2:52:53.440 --> 2:52:58.160]  year later they're dead why isn't always lung cancer these women don't even smoke but it's so many
[2:52:58.160 --> 2:53:01.920]  women i know that are young that i go to their funerals where they just get lung cancer now
[2:53:02.960 --> 2:53:09.760]  um we we see the pathogenesis in the pathways um because a lot and you uh just want to correct
[2:53:09.760 --> 2:53:16.000]  you briefly bobby kennedy's forward was our book plague of corruption which came out april 14th of
[2:53:16.000 --> 2:53:22.560]  2020 i just saw a quote him plugging your new book here so and and so but but what so what bobby shows
[2:53:22.560 --> 2:53:29.680]  in that forward is simian virus 40 simian virus 40 contaminated and it's a lung cancer causing
[2:53:29.680 --> 2:53:37.760]  virus and so the more vaccines you get the more not just sv 40 what sv 40 means is that's the 40th
[2:53:37.760 --> 2:53:43.760]  virus that was found you know think about the variants in the sequences not all um human immune
[2:53:43.760 --> 2:53:49.280]  deficiency viruses that are associated with any kind of disease that's why they can't be causative
[2:53:49.280 --> 2:53:55.200]  you know so the variants are all in the shots all along it you're not just saying this i saw
[2:53:55.760 --> 2:54:02.720]  fda documents from the 70s where they estimated 100 million americans were infected with sv 40
[2:54:02.720 --> 2:54:09.200]  from the liquid polio um correct and this is what bobby did so well in that forward and and this
[2:54:09.200 --> 2:54:15.040]  has been known for decades and that is a that is a virus associated with a kite type of lung cancer
[2:54:15.040 --> 2:54:21.920]  called mesothelioma but the xm rv families have variants that are associated with a deadly none
[2:54:21.920 --> 2:54:26.960]  you know it's it has nothing to do with with it's not let me raise this what about all these new
[2:54:26.960 --> 2:54:32.960]  mystery lung illnesses and cdc warrants the potential fall outbreak of rare polio like illness
[2:54:32.960 --> 2:54:36.240]  well i've already talked to nurses and doctors they say already they're seeing thousands of
[2:54:36.240 --> 2:54:41.440]  kids just in texas they're paralyzed but they won't say it's polio and the word is it's their
[2:54:41.440 --> 2:54:47.920]  parents were vaccinated what's going on there this has been going on for five maybe 10 years
[2:54:47.920 --> 2:54:56.000]  and and every case of polio caused in our country and perhaps our world is caused by the vaccine
[2:54:56.000 --> 2:55:03.520]  you injected the via the viruses it's a different strain it's a different variant so the cdc won't
[2:55:03.520 --> 2:55:14.240]  call it polio the cdc renamed it as acute flaccid myelitis it's polio clinically indistinguishable
[2:55:14.240 --> 2:55:22.080]  that this is what people have to understand for 40 years it's been infection by injection these
[2:55:22.080 --> 2:55:30.000]  aren't new diseases you know this was the important things of our discoveries we discovered oh my god
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:37.360]  how many new viruses has we created by injecting animal tissues aborted fetal tissues from other
[2:55:37.360 --> 2:55:44.880]  humans into individuals this it's not one new virus how many old diseases as john coffin wrote
[2:55:44.880 --> 2:55:54.240]  in a paper an opinion paper that published our 2000 that published um in the journal science um
[2:55:54.240 --> 2:56:02.400]  but when our groundbreaking paradigm shifting you know um world global pandemic ending paper
[2:56:03.120 --> 2:56:11.920]  published october 8th of 2009 october 8th of 2009 and and that family of viruses was associated with
[2:56:11.920 --> 2:56:18.720]  lung cancers with all of these things and the explosion the big discovery was how many new
[2:56:18.720 --> 2:56:25.760]  viruses have we created by directly injecting animal and aborted fetal tissue other people's
[2:56:25.760 --> 2:56:29.200]  viral and let's expand on that bill gates and fouts he write books saying there's too many
[2:56:29.200 --> 2:56:36.640]  people so they're doing this on purpose correct and have been for decades wow uh doc just just
[2:56:36.640 --> 2:56:41.840]  incredible uh interview and uh i've got to go to break if you can do five more minutes the next
[2:56:41.840 --> 2:56:45.760]  diary that little short segment you got to go i understand but i can't wait to read the book
[2:56:45.760 --> 2:56:49.920]  we've had a lot of great guests on but you've been the most on target the most hardcore cause all
[2:56:49.920 --> 2:56:54.240]  i do is read news and everything you're saying the crew just types in and pulls up mainstream news
[2:56:54.240 --> 2:56:59.040]  what's incredible is everything you're saying is actually admitted the public is just ignorant of it
[2:57:00.480 --> 2:57:06.320]  and the data are supported i'm a scientist i speak only data i'll give you my opinion offline but
[2:57:06.320 --> 2:57:11.680]  nothing i said isn't backed up by a reference in one of the three books in our thousands of pages
[2:57:11.680 --> 2:57:16.640]  including direct emails from tony fouchy and and we gotta go to break for two minutes you'll
[2:57:16.640 --> 2:57:20.560]  have five minutes to finish up on fouchy and then you say you're gonna come on sometime next week
[2:57:20.560 --> 2:57:26.400]  for a full hour of commercial free wow folks this interview has got to go viral i know there are
[2:57:26.400 --> 2:57:31.200]  probably two million people watching right now if you'll all decide to go to band off video tonight
[2:57:31.200 --> 2:57:36.800]  or free world news dot tv and grab this once it's archived and just share it and tell people to
[2:57:36.800 --> 2:57:42.080]  share it it'll get five million views i want to stop these monsters i want to send them to prison
[2:57:42.080 --> 2:57:48.880]  and we can do it we'll be right back gerald and stokes arealina go ahead you're on the air trying
[2:57:48.880 --> 2:57:54.160]  to move quicker hey alex welcome would like to say first off thanks for being the voice of reason
[2:57:54.160 --> 2:57:58.400]  and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people i've been trying to get a hold of you for
[2:57:58.400 --> 2:58:05.760]  a year okay i'm a double amputee and i have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away uh
[2:58:05.760 --> 2:58:11.600]  living defense saved my life they had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me
[2:58:11.600 --> 2:58:17.760]  living defense brought me back i wanted to just quote from the bible jesus is saying as to where
[2:58:17.760 --> 2:58:25.840]  we are right now this is matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall
[2:58:25.840 --> 2:58:32.960]  kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name sake and then shall many be offended and
[2:58:32.960 --> 2:58:38.160]  shall betray one another and shall hate one another that's right where we're at brother and that's
[2:58:38.160 --> 2:58:42.640]  because god's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why
[2:58:42.640 --> 2:58:49.760]  the enemy hates it because god created this country i've been fighting as hard as i can for
[2:58:49.760 --> 2:58:56.320]  almost 28 years against the globalist i wanted to stop their agenda i wanted to wake up the world
[2:58:56.320 --> 2:59:02.080]  and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational but we failed yes a lot of people
[2:59:02.080 --> 2:59:07.600]  are awake yes we're not getting caught flat footed but they are going ahead with their full
[2:59:07.600 --> 2:59:12.640]  operational deindustrialization great reset and that's why it's more important than ever
[2:59:12.640 --> 2:59:17.680]  that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready
[2:59:17.680 --> 2:59:21.760]  to wake up and ready to hear the truth so we've got a information warfare of the enemy and try
[2:59:21.760 --> 2:59:25.840]  to stop their agenda and we've also got to get personally prepared and one of the number one
[2:59:25.840 --> 2:59:30.240]  things to do is high quality storable food we've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable
[2:59:30.240 --> 2:59:35.760]  prices at info or store.com so whether it's a month or six month or a year supply or specialty
[2:59:35.760 --> 2:59:41.360]  diets it's ready to ship right now lock your orders in before food prices go up and before
[2:59:41.360 --> 2:59:46.160]  there are long lines and waits because believe me serious times are coming get ready at info
[2:59:46.160 --> 3:00:04.720]  or store.com you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:04.720 --> 3:00:10.640]  well i'm impressed dr judy a migovitz been wearing her for many years and she's whether
[3:00:10.640 --> 3:00:14.080]  she's going to join us again sometime next week but you were she was trying to get into
[3:00:14.080 --> 3:00:18.320]  fauci as we hit that break talking about the emails the documents the admissions
[3:00:19.040 --> 3:00:23.120]  and again everything she's saying we're just pulling it up while she says it it's all hiding in
[3:00:23.120 --> 3:00:29.360]  plain view so closing key comments for folks about what else they should know i think the
[3:00:29.360 --> 3:00:37.840]  closing key comments is stop looking at uh fauci the government um or anyone else to take control
[3:00:37.840 --> 3:00:44.720]  of your life it's time you took control back of your body of your health this is where we are
[3:00:44.720 --> 3:00:52.960]  we're telling you there are simple solutions now we've all we we all realize um and uh i don't
[3:00:53.680 --> 3:01:00.320]  it's it's difficult to you know i don't i don't care about him at all he does everything by
[3:01:00.320 --> 3:01:04.400]  plausible deniability or never anything to do with drudy migovitz of course you didn't you worked
[3:01:04.400 --> 3:01:10.880]  in but as the n a i a d you funded our studies you took down my my institute that neuro immune
[3:01:10.880 --> 3:01:16.720]  disease institute the first ever because it started showing the connections between viruses
[3:01:16.720 --> 3:01:22.320]  that can cause cancer and can cause neuroimmune diseases devastating diseases like parkinson's
[3:01:22.320 --> 3:01:30.480]  al s um Lyme disease uh me myalgic encephalomyelitis multiple sclerosis oh directly caused by the same
[3:01:30.480 --> 3:01:37.120]  cytokine storms the same pathways where where tony fauci put those diseases into the national
[3:01:37.120 --> 3:01:42.800]  institute of neuro developmental diseases and stroke they're not neuro developmental
[3:01:42.800 --> 3:01:48.960]  diseases and stroke they're the dysregulation of your god-given immune system and you allowed it
[3:01:48.960 --> 3:01:56.480]  to happen uh tony fauci is not my god you know i i believe in only one god and i fear only one god
[3:01:56.480 --> 3:02:05.120]  and and and that is we if we are as as you said in the last break if we are one nation under god
[3:02:05.120 --> 3:02:11.520]  this is indivisible with liberty and justice for all our immune system is god-given everything
[3:02:11.520 --> 3:02:20.320]  about our life is is is controlled by god we we trust god alone for our health i always have
[3:02:20.320 --> 3:02:26.800]  and and i always will and all i can try to do um as you try to do every day is to teach people
[3:02:26.800 --> 3:02:35.040]  you don't have to run fear is the is the disease i'm not afraid of anything um except not honoring
[3:02:35.040 --> 3:02:41.840]  biblical living because god delivers on those promises we have the health you don't need another
[3:02:41.840 --> 3:02:49.600]  thing to fight variant du jour whether it be delta gamma omega epsilon i don't care you know we can
[3:02:49.600 --> 3:02:58.640]  do this that's why i mentioned my own my own infections i worked with ebola hiv right there
[3:02:58.640 --> 3:03:05.280]  in the trenches 22 years then left founded co founded this institute um then got infected
[3:03:05.280 --> 3:03:11.280]  because we realized the viruses they were calling biosafety level two were actually
[3:03:11.280 --> 3:03:18.080]  contagious cancer causing viruses half my colleagues died working in biosafety level two
[3:03:18.080 --> 3:03:24.960]  i worked in biosafety level three with um hiv with the with biosafety level four with ebola
[3:03:24.960 --> 3:03:33.280]  never did i ever wear a mask wake up folks take off the mask if he says it do the opposite this is
[3:03:33.280 --> 3:03:40.800]  how absolutely and here's the good news tedris at the un faulty gates they don't look so they
[3:03:40.800 --> 3:03:46.720]  don't look so cocky now they look scared now yeah and i and i don't i don't have a tax on
[3:03:46.720 --> 3:03:56.080]  tony faulty i i don't care i my everything is is science i don't attack anyone i show you the data
[3:03:56.080 --> 3:04:02.480]  and i speak the data and i translate the data and tell it to you in a way that hopefully you can
[3:04:02.480 --> 3:04:08.560]  understand with solutions the blood supply was contaminated for almost 40 years we developed
[3:04:08.560 --> 3:04:16.160]  we we identified a solution serous technology c e r u s it's discussed in our book uh play and plague
[3:04:16.160 --> 3:04:21.600]  of corruption the technology decontaminates the blood supply so why did tony faulty cover it up
[3:04:21.600 --> 3:04:27.920]  that the x mrbs that these viruses were spread through the blood supply why did he deny people
[3:04:27.920 --> 3:04:35.280]  with myalgic encephalomyelitis or autism the treatment seramin ivermectin and antiretroviral
[3:04:35.280 --> 3:04:42.560]  therapies which are given as pre-exposure prophylaxis now low dose because he's a eugenicis criminal
[3:04:42.560 --> 3:04:47.440]  dr judy a mikovitz very impressed plague the book dot com we'll talk to you again soon godspeed

[3:08:41.040 --> 3:08:47.440]  guests one is taking a huge stand and the other one is going to be talking about uh as an x-fizer
[3:08:47.440 --> 3:08:53.920]  employee is going to be talking about the vaccine of course uh isn't that the topic of the day isn't
[3:08:53.920 --> 3:08:58.640]  it insane what we're having to deal with right now all across the country i'm hearing stories
[3:08:58.640 --> 3:09:04.240]  and i'm getting emails of people that are desperate uh they know that their jobs are in question
[3:09:04.240 --> 3:09:08.960]  they don't know what to do and they are literally desperate for help and so we're going to try
[3:09:08.960 --> 3:09:14.960]  to do that today there's so many things going on right now that are just insane to talk about
[3:09:14.960 --> 3:09:22.080]  the commercial did you guys get this the commercial for 60 seconds and it was all about australia's
[3:09:22.080 --> 3:09:29.840]  camp uh well camp uh thousand beds and they're saying oh hey experts are wanting us to bring
[3:09:29.840 --> 3:09:35.920]  people from other countries into our little camp and here's the here's the rug you get to have
[3:09:36.960 --> 3:09:43.680]  a balcony and fresh air you lucky dog you you get to have your own balcony as you're confined
[3:09:43.680 --> 3:09:50.320]  like a prisoner in a in a covid camp and all they could say was hey we need to keep people safe
[3:09:50.880 --> 3:09:57.040]  i just love being so safe and wrapped in bubble wrap it's awesome isn't it i'm just so happy for
[3:09:57.040 --> 3:10:04.800]  the safety concerns of all of all all around the world um from a cold virus but i was lured when i
[3:10:04.800 --> 3:10:10.960]  saw the commercial that was stating oh my gosh you are going to love this camp it's kind of like
[3:10:10.960 --> 3:10:18.720]  a little resort you'll love it you'll love it i'm up hoards you guys i know that we think that this
[3:10:18.720 --> 3:10:23.840]  can't happen in this country i know that we think that we're immune and i think we honestly think
[3:10:23.840 --> 3:10:30.560]  that well we have all these things in place but you know what i'm not sure that i'm not sure that
[3:10:30.560 --> 3:10:36.320]  we do i'm not sure that it's going to amount in a situation where we're going to be able to fight
[3:10:36.320 --> 3:10:42.640]  it if we don't start standing strong and that's what one of my guests from the uh la fd uh the
[3:10:42.640 --> 3:10:48.240]  los angeles fire department's going to talk about today because as these agencies are taking a stand
[3:10:48.240 --> 3:10:54.560]  this is going to be this is going to be really great for our country as we watch these people take
[3:10:54.560 --> 3:11:01.840]  the stand and know that what they're doing is standing up for all of us you know we have a
[3:11:01.840 --> 3:11:07.920]  distinct and serious problem going on and if you choose not to take this vaccine you shouldn't have
[3:11:07.920 --> 3:11:14.800]  to take this vaccine am i right this should be about your choice and of course i have karen
[3:11:14.800 --> 3:11:21.040]  uh kingston a former phaser employee and current current analyst for the pharmaceutical and medical
[3:11:21.040 --> 3:11:28.320]  device industries hi karen how are you hi kate good to see you oh you too in fact we've been we've
[3:11:28.320 --> 3:11:33.680]  been chatting and i'm gonna say that karen is a strong strong voice out there in talking about
[3:11:33.680 --> 3:11:39.920]  the things that you probably have the most concern about right now and that is the force of an
[3:11:39.920 --> 3:11:44.960]  experimental shot and what's in it and i think that this is probably one of the most important
[3:11:44.960 --> 3:11:49.600]  things we could be talking about today it's on everybody's mind uh it's getting shoved down our
[3:11:49.600 --> 3:11:56.400]  throats and karen with your background uh your legal uh you know kind of your i would say analyst
[3:11:56.400 --> 3:12:04.320]  expertise in looking at the patents the moderna patent let's talk about that i i'm floored about
[3:12:04.320 --> 3:12:09.840]  graphing oxide all kinds of things before we get to that i have points i want to talk about because
[3:12:09.840 --> 3:12:13.760]  you just mentioned what's going on in australia so it's really important for the american people to
[3:12:13.760 --> 3:12:19.200]  know that we currently are under attack by domestic terrorists that are promoting under the guise of
[3:12:19.200 --> 3:12:23.520]  promoting our health and safety of our community and they're taking away our liberties and they're
[3:12:23.520 --> 3:12:29.440]  taking away our economy and they are poisoning and harming um our our adults our military and our
[3:12:29.440 --> 3:12:34.960]  children under the guise of promoting protection of our communities and our health so that's
[3:12:34.960 --> 3:12:40.320]  domestic terrorism just want to be clear about that these also i want to be clear that the fda
[3:12:40.320 --> 3:12:47.680]  did approve the vaccines on august 23rd but there is no currently available a vaccine in the market
[3:12:47.680 --> 3:12:53.360]  uh that has gone through good manufacturing processes so uh phyzer has until September 6 to
[3:12:53.360 --> 3:13:02.880]  submit final vials um and to report to the fda uh per section 614 uh of the usc tidal code 21
[3:13:02.880 --> 3:13:09.360]  they have until september 6 to report to the fda any biological product deviations from the product
[3:13:09.360 --> 3:13:16.080]  labeling including all deviations complaints and adverse events regarding co-mernity which is bnt
[3:13:16.080 --> 3:13:21.920]  162b which is the vaccine so we don't have confirmation of what's in these vials and we
[3:13:21.920 --> 3:13:26.080]  don't have confirmation on the final numbers of the uh death and harm that they've caused to the
[3:13:26.080 --> 3:13:31.120]  american people so far so i just want to be clear about that i'm so glad you mentioned that graphene
[3:13:31.120 --> 3:13:38.560]  oxide is suspected in this shot did you want to talk about that yeah sure i again i i i just wanted
[3:13:38.560 --> 3:13:42.880]  to be clear that people so you know that these are not approved under the eua they cannot be
[3:13:42.880 --> 3:13:50.400]  mandated hold a stand um they're you know there's there's no benefit to being injected um i don't
[3:13:50.400 --> 3:13:55.680]  have a patent there is no benefit there is no benefit i can't imagine somebody making this
[3:13:55.680 --> 3:14:01.040]  decision with all of this up in the air the confusion alone what in the world you know my
[3:14:01.040 --> 3:14:05.680]  husband uh was asking me he said he said how do you know you're on the right side of this shot
[3:14:05.680 --> 3:14:10.720]  and i said it's really really easy look who's trying to shove it down your throat look who's
[3:14:10.720 --> 3:14:16.000]  trying to give this to you the very people that haven't been able to be trusted for hundreds of
[3:14:16.000 --> 3:14:22.160]  years um it is flooring to me that people are are thinking yeah let's just jab this thing in
[3:14:22.160 --> 3:14:28.320]  our arm and see where it goes we are the product of being guinea pigs right now for their trial
[3:14:28.320 --> 3:14:32.800]  that even the government admits it goes on until the year 2023 correct
[3:14:36.160 --> 3:14:43.120]  the trial was um upended in january of this year when they unblinded the placebo group and
[3:14:43.120 --> 3:14:47.840]  injected them so um legally technically they should have started the trials all over again
[3:14:47.840 --> 3:14:55.600]  in january of this year so there are no trials this is just a giant um it's a well it's i wouldn't
[3:14:55.600 --> 3:15:02.960]  it's bio warfare is what it is i i just want to be clear this is bio warfare the the i've gone
[3:15:02.960 --> 3:15:07.600]  over i'm sorry i'm getting frustrated because i i know there's a lot of information i shared but
[3:15:07.600 --> 3:15:11.680]  some of the stuff i've also shared is that if you go back and you take a look at the clinical
[3:15:11.680 --> 3:15:17.680]  research that was done to create these m r and a vaccines they were done in conjunction with the
[3:15:17.680 --> 3:15:23.440]  people's republic of china's military and scientists that there's no gray area what's going on here
[3:15:23.440 --> 3:15:30.400]  anymore i um there's no benefit to be injected yeah i think that's a great point to go that far
[3:15:30.400 --> 3:15:34.800]  and it really needs to go that far i know we have a break coming up but i understand and and when
[3:15:34.800 --> 3:15:41.920]  you say bio warfare yes i absolutely i agree with you i agree with you um this is a warfare on

[3:20:07.120 --> 3:20:24.400]  hi back here with you
[3:20:25.760 --> 3:20:30.720]  hi back here with you i am kate dally from the kate dally show big thank you to alex
[3:20:30.720 --> 3:20:38.080]  i have karin kinkston she is the former phyzer employee and current analyst for the pharmaceutical
[3:20:38.080 --> 3:20:44.000]  and medical device industries so i welcome karin back to the show and she has a lot to say i'm
[3:20:44.000 --> 3:20:50.080]  really excited to have her on with me i want to talk about plasmid dna in these vaccines karin
[3:20:50.720 --> 3:20:56.560]  how it's changing human dna i think so many people might not understand what is actually going on
[3:20:56.560 --> 3:21:04.720]  with this too and hydrogel let's talk about both um sure in regards to hydrogel let's just attack
[3:21:04.720 --> 3:21:10.480]  that first because it's related to the war that's going on between the united states and china and
[3:21:10.480 --> 3:21:16.160]  i know or sorry the people's republic of china and the ccp and i i understand that people in america
[3:21:16.160 --> 3:21:22.880]  don't seem to be aware of this but if you read the newspapers from uh the people's republic of china
[3:21:22.880 --> 3:21:28.000]  whether it's china daily news the gen one news or global times there's a number of articles
[3:21:28.720 --> 3:21:34.080]  such as this one which is recounting the seven sins of the u.s alliance system and i mean they
[3:21:34.080 --> 3:21:38.640]  clearly state there will be severe penalties for the seven sins committed by the u.s justice
[3:21:38.640 --> 3:21:44.400]  um the world can't thank china enough for ushering into an era of multi polarity where the evil empire
[3:21:44.400 --> 3:21:50.560]  the united states can no longer call the shots and do as it pleases um we are lucky enough to witness
[3:21:50.560 --> 3:21:56.000]  these profound changes and 500 years of western domination coming to an end and americans gnashing
[3:21:56.000 --> 3:22:03.280]  their teeth and hell is basically what this says so um i want to be clear that we are in war and
[3:22:03.280 --> 3:22:08.960]  there's bio warfare going on in regards to hydrogel there's a couple important points one uh there
[3:22:08.960 --> 3:22:15.440]  was a patent filed uh in china by shanghai nanotech in january of this year specifically for the use
[3:22:15.440 --> 3:22:22.160]  of graphene oxide in mrna lipid nanoparticle encapsulated vaccines for covet 19 that's literally
[3:22:22.160 --> 3:22:28.240]  the title of the patent um so again don't cool to think that this is not a war but what's more
[3:22:28.240 --> 3:22:37.520]  alarming is that in moderna uh filed a patent on july 7th uh 2020 it's us patent 10703789
[3:22:37.520 --> 3:22:42.480]  and i'm just going to read for you verbatim if there's any gray error regarding graphene oxide
[3:22:42.480 --> 3:22:49.440]  and um hydrogel being in these injections make no mistake it is irrefutably in there so this is
[3:22:49.440 --> 3:22:56.480]  again us patent 10703789 the abstract decides describes the art the art is a description of the
[3:22:56.480 --> 3:23:03.200]  technology um basically verbatim it says that it is a um uh lipid nanoparticles with the size of
[3:23:03.200 --> 3:23:10.000]  80 to 160 nanometers exactly the size of what's going to be in these um uh injections the lipid
[3:23:10.000 --> 3:23:15.120]  nanoparticles the injections it goes on to say it has the phospholipid the calc cholesterol uh the
[3:23:15.120 --> 3:23:20.880]  ionized lipid known as a catanized lipid and the polyethylene glycol the pegalated lipid if you go
[3:23:20.880 --> 3:23:29.440]  to section 219 the bottom of 219 and the top of section 220 it clearly states kate um disclosed here
[3:23:29.440 --> 3:23:34.880]  in may be encapsulated into any hydrogel known in the art so the description what's in here
[3:23:34.880 --> 3:23:40.720]  which may form a gel when injected into a subject hydrogels are a network of polymer chains that
[3:23:40.720 --> 3:23:46.560]  are hydrophilic and sometimes found as a colloidal gel they're highly absorbent uh naturally synthetic
[3:23:46.560 --> 3:23:51.680]  polymers now keep in mind it says you're going to be injected with a gel that's going to form its
[3:23:51.680 --> 3:23:57.760]  own gel so these are pre-programmed and they know how to um create their own um miniature system
[3:23:57.760 --> 3:24:02.960]  within your body it's it's a form of advanced of artificial intelligence and advanced technology
[3:24:02.960 --> 3:24:07.840]  and hydrogel is made of graphene oxide again that's irrefutable there's literally hundreds
[3:24:07.840 --> 3:24:15.040]  and hundreds of studies that you can find on our own nih.gov website regarding graphene oxide
[3:24:15.040 --> 3:24:21.840]  in hydrogel um so the reason why graphene oxide is in disease is because it can is a great conductor
[3:24:21.840 --> 3:24:28.080]  of an electromagnetic field so if you go on to continue to read this patent you'll find another
[3:24:28.080 --> 3:24:35.280]  patent that um relates to the use of these uh hydrogel lipid nanoparticles being able to
[3:24:35.280 --> 3:24:41.120]  communicate and exchange data and signals with an external wireless device that was developed in
[3:24:41.120 --> 3:24:47.840]  collaboration with dot com so if and it talks about the subjects who are injected again you can
[3:24:47.840 --> 3:24:52.960]  you can exchange data and signals um from a wireless device to those subjects who have been
[3:24:52.960 --> 3:24:59.840]  injected with these vaccines which are bio weapons that contain lipid nanoparticle um
[3:24:59.840 --> 3:25:06.000]  graphene oxide hydrogel so what that means is the subjects are the american people our children
[3:25:06.000 --> 3:25:14.240]  in our military we're at war it just i think people have to absorb this they they need to
[3:25:14.240 --> 3:25:20.800]  understand what is in these shots and i can't imagine why cnn and abc and all of these networks
[3:25:20.800 --> 3:25:27.680]  aren't just running with this story uh karen it is insanity that we do not even know what's in the
[3:25:27.680 --> 3:25:32.320]  shot and people are signing up for it left and right out of guilt and shame and i just still
[3:25:32.320 --> 3:25:36.880]  can't believe it even when you're saying these things i think the american people still cannot
[3:25:36.880 --> 3:25:42.880]  believe what we're injecting ourselves with because of a fear of common cold well you know
[3:25:42.880 --> 3:25:48.080]  president it's not just because of common cold it's because of public shaming um a former president
[3:25:48.080 --> 3:25:55.760]  reagan um at a rally for berry goldwater in 1964 i think he's quoting alexander hamilton he goes um
[3:25:55.760 --> 3:26:02.080]  you know those societies those nations who would prefer to disgrace to defeat are ready for a master
[3:26:02.080 --> 3:26:08.480]  their servants ready for a master and quite frankly they deserve one we are the if if americans if
[3:26:08.480 --> 3:26:15.760]  god's people remain silent we will be enslaved the truth cannot prevail if we don't speak up
[3:26:15.760 --> 3:26:22.480]  up so i call upon all christians all god-fearing men and women to start speaking up about the truth
[3:26:22.480 --> 3:26:27.680]  of the harm damage poison and death that these injections are bringing upon american people
[3:26:27.680 --> 3:26:33.600]  and our children for goodness sake the the left the enemy is going around touting how we all need
[3:26:33.600 --> 3:26:39.040]  to get injected which he had just remained silent that is not a way to fight the enemy that is not
[3:26:39.040 --> 3:26:44.160]  biblical that is not in scripture we have a covenant with god uh to put on the armor of god
[3:26:44.160 --> 3:26:49.680]  and and the sword the sword is the sword of truth it is the word it is the written and spoken word
[3:26:50.240 --> 3:26:55.360]  speak up and show up that's the only way we can defeat this we can't pray for trump to
[3:26:55.360 --> 3:27:01.760]  come in on a white horse and just save us one day oh bless you karen kingston i'm so happy
[3:27:01.760 --> 3:27:08.480]  that you're bringing this out you know what we're all fired up as we should be we as a nation should
[3:27:08.480 --> 3:27:15.920]  be fired up as to what is going on right now and these injections are so dangerous it is war
[3:27:15.920 --> 3:27:21.280]  it is war upon the people and we have to treat it as such you are right you're a hundred percent
[3:27:21.280 --> 3:27:26.880]  right can't argue with you yeah absolutely and i think uh knowing that what this can do inside
[3:27:26.880 --> 3:27:32.880]  the body how it changes us is crucial to understanding what's going on here and speaking
[3:27:32.880 --> 3:27:37.760]  of that the plasmid dna if you want to get to that i mean truly it changes you inside the body
[3:27:37.760 --> 3:27:45.040]  that was not released to um any of the american people or global citizens plasmid dna so i found
[3:27:45.040 --> 3:27:51.120]  it because um agc biologics is the number one manufacturer for the biotech Pfizer vaccine
[3:27:51.120 --> 3:27:59.040]  for plasmid dna the only purpose of plasmid dna is to produce new chromosominal um dna within your
[3:27:59.040 --> 3:28:06.720]  body um it can be bacterial viral and or from another species it literally changes the dna so
[3:28:06.720 --> 3:28:11.360]  the way that god created us we were formed perfectly within our mother's wounds we were
[3:28:12.720 --> 3:28:18.640]  formed perfectly in the image of god satan can only uh deceive steal and destroy and that is
[3:28:18.640 --> 3:28:23.040]  what he to to god's children that is his intention and that is what's happening when you're injected
[3:28:23.040 --> 3:28:29.440]  with these vaccines the code that god used to create us perfectly within his image has now
[3:28:29.440 --> 3:28:37.520]  been hijacked um by the enemy so you are no longer a spiritual war it's a spiritual war we have to
[3:28:37.520 --> 3:28:42.560]  go to a break karen i'm just loving that you're talking about this thank you for your courage
[3:28:42.560 --> 3:28:47.840]  and uh in talking about this i know that probably isn't easy and i really appreciate it i mean easy
[3:28:47.840 --> 3:28:51.920]  for you i think you're a very strong woman and i just really appreciate you karen kingston uh
[3:28:51.920 --> 3:28:57.440]  former Pfizer and analysts thank you very very much i i wanted to hear this you know listeners
[3:28:57.440 --> 3:29:03.760]  calling to the show and they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic because i sit there and i beg you
[3:29:03.760 --> 3:29:09.520]  for support constantly for prayer for financial support and for word of mouth and then we're

[3:29:18.000 --> 3:29:22.320]  in the united states that promotes liberty at this level that is not beholden to big corporate
[3:29:22.320 --> 3:29:26.960]  sponsors and they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else they crippled all the other groups
[3:29:26.960 --> 3:29:32.160]  and we're still here and as this whole new world order comes out the open our credibility is going
[3:29:32.160 --> 3:29:36.400]  up that's why we've got to be taken off air that's why america has got to be taken down you can't
[3:29:36.400 --> 3:29:41.680]  have all these other nations enslaved and america is still quasi free you can't have info wars has
[3:29:41.680 --> 3:29:46.560]  been proven right be on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold because if you think stuff's
[3:29:46.560 --> 3:29:51.760]  bad now just get ready so thank you all and get an info war store dot com get some great 2020 election
[3:29:51.760 --> 3:29:55.600]  shirts supplements and so much more they're wonderful products and they support the info we're
[3:29:55.600 --> 3:30:02.640]  thank you i've been fighting as hard as i can for almost 28 years against the globalist i wanted to
[3:30:02.640 --> 3:30:08.560]  stop their agenda i wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went
[3:30:08.560 --> 3:30:14.400]  operational but we failed yes a lot of people are awake yes we're not getting caught flatfooted but
[3:30:14.400 --> 3:30:20.720]  they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset and that's why
[3:30:20.720 --> 3:30:25.600]  it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the
[3:30:25.600 --> 3:30:30.240]  show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth so we've got an information
[3:30:30.240 --> 3:30:34.560]  warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda but we've also got to get personally prepared
[3:30:34.560 --> 3:30:38.160]  and one of the number one things to do is high quality storeable food we've got the best food

[3:33:18.640 --> 3:33:23.840]  hi there cake dally back with you from the cake dally show so happy to be back with you and a big
[3:33:23.840 --> 3:33:28.400]  thank you to karen kingston for talking about what is in the shot we really need to know
[3:33:28.400 --> 3:33:33.920]  this i'm surprised more people aren't asking more questions about what's in that franken shot as alex
[3:33:33.920 --> 3:33:40.400]  calls it i love that term um you can go to kdally radio dot com you can stream my show live all you
[3:33:40.400 --> 3:33:45.360]  have to do is click listen live from the website kdally radio dot com for more on all these subjects
[3:33:45.360 --> 3:33:51.440]  we cover them daily and appreciate being here as your guest host my next guest i want to introduce
[3:33:51.440 --> 3:33:57.440]  you to is a powerful voice i in california john nox los angeles fire department firefighter
[3:33:57.440 --> 3:34:04.080]  paramedic so grateful to have him on with me because the firefighters in los angeles are
[3:34:04.080 --> 3:34:11.120]  taking a stand and they are telling firefighters all over the country you can take a stand too
[3:34:11.120 --> 3:34:17.600]  which is really amazing we really need to have big groups big county employee groups stand up
[3:34:17.600 --> 3:34:23.520]  in opposition to the force and so of course i welcome john nox with me because what a message
[3:34:23.520 --> 3:34:28.960]  he has for all of you and also his courage i think you'll be moved by his courage as well
[3:34:28.960 --> 3:34:35.280]  karen kingston's courage too everyone's got this courage and now if we all displayed that courage
[3:34:35.280 --> 3:34:41.120]  how amazing this could be and we could really change uh really turn the tide if you will
[3:34:41.120 --> 3:34:46.720]  this is what it's all about it's turning the tide and getting the momentum behind us and so it's
[3:34:46.720 --> 3:34:53.280]  really important to be able to hear from people like john nox uh john are you with me i am how you
[3:34:53.280 --> 3:34:59.200]  doing oh incredible thank you i'm so glad you're joining me what a voice you are tell us about
[3:34:59.200 --> 3:35:04.640]  the stand that the la fd is taking and it's inspiring firefighters all over the country
[3:35:07.280 --> 3:35:15.200]  well a couple weeks ago we had uh our city council that mandated that put a mandate into effect
[3:35:15.200 --> 3:35:25.840]  that basically if we did not um get the shot or get vaccinated by september 30th i believe it is
[3:35:25.840 --> 3:35:34.080]  that uh we would be terminated or had the possibility of being terminated so uh that started raising
[3:35:34.080 --> 3:35:41.920]  a lot of questions um throughout the department because uh again not everybody is vaccinated
[3:35:41.920 --> 3:35:47.360]  or has taken the shot and not everybody wants to and so there was a union meeting
[3:35:47.360 --> 3:35:58.160]  um that took place uh about a week week ago maybe a little less than that and during that union
[3:35:58.160 --> 3:36:08.480]  meeting it was very apparent that there was a lot of fear a lot of uncertainty and as i sat there
[3:36:08.480 --> 3:36:17.680]  as i sat there trying to figure out what to say how to approach the situation i already knew in my
[3:36:17.680 --> 3:36:26.880]  mind where i what my thought process is you know what my values my beliefs are and as a american
[3:36:26.880 --> 3:36:35.840]  citizen i have very specific rights that are enabled to me by the creator and so throughout this
[3:36:35.840 --> 3:36:41.600]  there was a lot of questions being asked and there was really not a whole lot of answers being given
[3:36:41.600 --> 3:36:51.040]  at that time um and i understand that our union again is you know supposed to be working with us
[3:36:52.400 --> 3:37:00.160]  but the questions that were being raised were questions like what do we do i have a family
[3:37:00.160 --> 3:37:07.680]  to support you know my wife and my kids uh what happens are you guys negotiating is there and
[3:37:07.680 --> 3:37:14.000]  and i understand where they're coming from from the standpoint that they have a negotiating process
[3:37:14.000 --> 3:37:24.720]  they have to go through but for me i wasn't i'm not going to sit and let them count on that
[3:37:24.720 --> 3:37:32.480]  so i took a stand and for me planning my flag drawing a line in the sand stating that i will not get
[3:37:33.200 --> 3:37:43.040]  a shot or get vaccinated and that's my personal choice um i don't need to wear a mask i don't
[3:37:43.040 --> 3:37:50.880]  need to test if i'm not sick these are issues that we don't test non-sick people we don't
[3:37:50.880 --> 3:37:59.120]  quarantine the healthy and there's a ton of evidence as far as mask and so on and so forth
[3:37:59.120 --> 3:38:10.560]  that go along the lines i mean of uh our health issues as firefighters so anyway to make a longer
[3:38:10.560 --> 3:38:16.000]  story short um i basically stood up because there was a lot of questions and a lot of fear what i
[3:38:16.000 --> 3:38:21.600]  felt in that room was fear and nobody really knew what to do so when i stood up i made it a point
[3:38:21.600 --> 3:38:30.560]  to state you know you're the city will have to terminate me because i will not go and get that
[3:38:30.560 --> 3:38:37.920]  shot voluntarily and and i will continue to come to work as long as i am healthy and no mandate
[3:38:37.920 --> 3:38:45.360]  that you put into effect is going to affect me in that way right because those mandates are
[3:38:45.360 --> 3:38:52.880]  unconstitutional no bureaucratic agency no the federal government is not doing this they've
[3:38:52.880 --> 3:39:00.880]  pushed it off to the local agencies and small business and so you know we have constitutional
[3:39:00.880 --> 3:39:06.960]  rights we have states rights we have civil liberties that are being violated right now that
[3:39:08.560 --> 3:39:14.560]  people are not wrapping their head around this is not a vaccinated versus unvaccinated
[3:39:14.560 --> 3:39:21.200]  this is not a left versus right issue standing up for here what our group firefighters for
[3:39:21.200 --> 3:39:28.080]  freedom stands for is the right to choose is the right as a sovereign individual of the united
[3:39:28.080 --> 3:39:35.920]  states of america we're citizens we have very specific rights and so by you putting a mandate
[3:39:35.920 --> 3:39:45.840]  into effect and i mean there's a ton of issues with that but you don't have a right to say what
[3:39:45.840 --> 3:39:54.800]  i put into my body or manage my body autonomy that is a basic freedom if we lose that we lose it
[3:39:54.800 --> 3:40:02.560]  all i can't imagine that people can't get this yeah it's a very simple concept you know and we're
[3:40:02.560 --> 3:40:09.360]  on a very slippery slope here in the united states right now i mean the world is looking to us right
[3:40:09.360 --> 3:40:16.720]  now you know australia they're a disaster canada is a disaster europe's having the same problem
[3:40:16.720 --> 3:40:23.200]  and everybody's looking to us you know we have the constitution we have strength in numbers and there
[3:40:23.200 --> 3:40:30.320]  are so many people that believe the same thing that and even if you are on the on the vaccinated
[3:40:30.320 --> 3:40:38.240]  side again it this is not a vax versus unvax at some point if this does not go through and
[3:40:38.240 --> 3:40:46.560]  and this does not win the fact that you know my body my choice then the person that believes
[3:40:46.560 --> 3:40:54.960]  this mandate is correct somewhere down the line there's going to be a mandate in the next 18 months
[3:40:54.960 --> 3:41:00.000]  that is going to violate one of their beliefs and then you're not going to have a leg to stand on
[3:41:00.000 --> 3:41:06.160]  whatsoever because at that point you've already rolled over and submitted to their authority
[3:41:06.160 --> 3:41:13.440]  to their tyranny and said yes go ahead make these mandates and you decide for me what is right
[3:41:14.480 --> 3:41:21.200]  and and that's not okay it's a great point you know even the data shores up the very basic
[3:41:21.840 --> 3:41:26.560]  the very basic components of what you're talking about so where whether people wear masks or not
[3:41:26.560 --> 3:41:32.000]  never mattered it didn't do a thing uh whether i mean honestly all of the points that they're
[3:41:32.000 --> 3:41:37.920]  trying to bring up are not backed by data anyway but what you're talking about is the basic right
[3:41:37.920 --> 3:41:43.520]  to body autonomy they cannot force you to take a shot because they guarantee you there's 300 more
[3:41:43.520 --> 3:41:50.880]  shots and so i'm not quite sure how people come to the conclusion that this is okay for the safety
[3:41:50.880 --> 3:41:58.480]  of man this has nothing to do with that and it was what under 0.1 percent that were even clarified
[3:41:58.480 --> 3:42:06.880]  or even i i i say that loosely uh designated as covid deaths and i i cannot understand why people
[3:42:06.880 --> 3:42:12.880]  think this is uh something that people have to do you are right to fight this i love and my hat tip
[3:42:12.880 --> 3:42:18.240]  big hat tip to all of the firefighters that are fighting this too and when i come back with john
[3:42:18.240 --> 3:42:23.680]  i have more to say i know you have more to say about body autonomy about standing up as a basic
[3:42:23.680 --> 3:42:29.120]  american when you said plant your flag all i kept thinking of was that iconic image of
[3:42:29.120 --> 3:42:34.320]  planning the flag you have to plant the flag in your own life and come to terms with the fact that
[3:42:34.320 --> 3:42:39.840]  if you're not in this fight you are on the wrong side of the fight so you need to be in on this

[3:47:18.720 --> 3:47:22.560]  back here with you i'm kate dowley your guest host today from the kate dowley show
[3:47:22.560 --> 3:47:28.320]  and i'm so glad to be here with you two very important guests karen kinkson with breaking news
[3:47:28.320 --> 3:47:35.200]  about the ingredients of the moderna patent this is huge news and one of the reasons one of the
[3:47:35.200 --> 3:47:42.640]  absolute reasons to take a stand my guest right now is john nox from the los angeles fire department
[3:47:42.640 --> 3:47:49.200]  firefighter paramedic and they are taking a hard and inspiring stand against this county
[3:47:49.200 --> 3:47:53.760]  mandate there's a lot of county employees there's a lot of hospitals there's a lot of schools
[3:47:53.760 --> 3:47:58.960]  that are forcing this on their employees and a lot of different industries are too and you
[3:47:58.960 --> 3:48:04.880]  know we were we john and i were talking about this previously and i think one of the problems john is
[3:48:04.880 --> 3:48:11.040]  that those that are sitting back and going along to get along are doing it to preserve their home
[3:48:11.040 --> 3:48:16.320]  to preserve their families soccer you know soccer and they cost them all the different little
[3:48:16.320 --> 3:48:21.360]  different games all the kids are in and and maintain their life the problem is is that
[3:48:21.360 --> 3:48:27.040]  they're actually going to lose all of that in the end if we are forced to do this if we lose
[3:48:27.040 --> 3:48:32.640]  body autonomy and property rights we really do cease to be americans and this is something that
[3:48:32.640 --> 3:48:38.080]  i know you guys get the firefighters get we understand that you guys understand this and
[3:48:38.080 --> 3:48:43.520]  you're trying to let people know that you are taking a stand for them because as much as we're
[3:48:43.520 --> 3:48:48.640]  trying to preserve every nook and cranny of our lives so we're not disturbed we're about to lose
[3:48:48.640 --> 3:48:55.840]  everything and i mean everything did you want to comment on that yeah that's um that's really
[3:48:55.840 --> 3:49:03.680]  important and for a long time you know people of 10 15 years i don't know how many conversations
[3:49:03.680 --> 3:49:08.480]  you have but people ask the same question you know what's going on in this country when is this
[3:49:08.480 --> 3:49:14.800]  going to stop the insanity the madness it's going down or whatever it is people you know are fed up
[3:49:14.800 --> 3:49:20.880]  but nobody has ever really they're like i don't understand when are things going to change and
[3:49:20.880 --> 3:49:28.720]  to me this is and this is i guess pun intended but shot that's heard around the world you know
[3:49:28.720 --> 3:49:36.080]  this is the next american revolution from the standpoint that we as a society have been so
[3:49:36.080 --> 3:49:44.480]  quiet and timid and asleep at the wheel and now is the time to take that stand is it uncomfortable
[3:49:44.480 --> 3:49:55.520]  yes do i want to lose my job my career absolutely not but at the same time if i don't stand up for
[3:49:55.520 --> 3:50:07.440]  this my children my grandchildren and everyone else will end up being slaves because this is pure
[3:50:07.440 --> 3:50:13.200]  insanity we're literally losing we're we're not losing them we're just giving them up our
[3:50:13.200 --> 3:50:18.880]  constitutional rights you know we have the declaration of independence we have the constitution
[3:50:18.880 --> 3:50:25.920]  and we have the bill of rights and those things were penned and put together for very specific reasons
[3:50:25.920 --> 3:50:36.320]  they give they allow it those documents allow the government it gives them consent to govern us
[3:50:37.040 --> 3:50:43.440]  not to rule us and that is what is happening literally as everyone's been asleep we're losing
[3:50:43.440 --> 3:50:50.240]  you know amendments freedoms first fourth fourteenth amendment those are huge that's your
[3:50:50.240 --> 3:50:56.720]  your right to you know the first amendment religion freedom of speech freedom of press
[3:50:58.080 --> 3:51:04.800]  peaceably assemble tell me during coveted in the past 18 months that we went from total
[3:51:04.800 --> 3:51:12.320]  normal society to where we are right now and it was 10 days to flatten the curve and then it was
[3:51:12.320 --> 3:51:18.640]  stay in your home you know for six months and then it was if you get the shot life will go back to
[3:51:18.640 --> 3:51:23.600]  normal and then it's now you're going to need a booster and then it's we're going back into lock
[3:51:23.600 --> 3:51:30.160]  downs you can't go into uh you know in california they're trying to pass right now you cannot go
[3:51:30.160 --> 3:51:39.440]  into any indoor establishment if you have been have not been vaccinated and don't have your card
[3:51:39.440 --> 3:51:48.160]  and that's insanity i mean so those i mean think about during coveted if you're a christian or a
[3:51:48.160 --> 3:51:57.440]  muslim whatever your church your synagogue your temple was closed yet liquor stores were open
[3:51:58.320 --> 3:52:04.880]  now last time i checked the first amendment the text religious freedom not liquor stores not home
[3:52:04.880 --> 3:52:13.040]  depot not cosco not not any of that stuff but i couldn't go and worship in my church i wasn't
[3:52:13.040 --> 3:52:18.160]  allowed to leave my home or go assemble peaceably assemble that's part of the first amendment as
[3:52:18.160 --> 3:52:26.720]  well so freedom of press here we go we we right we don't have channels to speak out as soon as you
[3:52:26.720 --> 3:52:32.800]  speak out about these issues you're literally cancelled we have cancelled culture we have
[3:52:32.800 --> 3:52:40.400]  we have you know big facebook all these other entities that are telling you what you can and
[3:52:40.400 --> 3:52:48.480]  can't say everything you post is false it's fact-checked by mysterious little known somewhere
[3:52:48.480 --> 3:52:55.840]  you know nothing really powers that be right it's communist it really truly is that people would
[3:52:55.840 --> 3:53:00.320]  realize what we're being fact-checked by and you know like you know the feds could not pass this
[3:53:00.320 --> 3:53:05.440]  right they couldn't get away with it so they're leaning on counties and states to try to do this
[3:53:05.440 --> 3:53:10.480]  in industries that are bought in by pharma to try to do the bidding for them and this is why it's
[3:53:10.480 --> 3:53:17.600]  crucial that we take a stand and i'm so proud of the la fd in taking the stand in saying absolutely
[3:53:17.600 --> 3:53:23.600]  no not on our watch and you have a lot of guys in on this too that are saying absolutely no right a
[3:53:23.600 --> 3:53:31.280]  lot of support we do we have a lot of support there there we've hired an attorney we have a
[3:53:31.280 --> 3:53:38.720]  ton of support within our department you know i understand that people are scared but that's
[3:53:38.720 --> 3:53:48.640]  normal yet at the same time that the time has come for people to stop being scared to embrace
[3:53:48.640 --> 3:53:56.480]  the rights that you were not only given by our creator but that were made this country the greatest
[3:53:56.480 --> 3:54:02.400]  country in the world that allowed us freedoms that no one else has had and we are losing those and
[3:54:02.400 --> 3:54:10.560]  we will continue to lose those at an exponential speed that the people i mean in 18 months you're
[3:54:10.560 --> 3:54:15.920]  not going to realize what this country looks like and that's terrifying and to me that's why
[3:54:15.920 --> 3:54:22.640]  that's why i'm taking a stand and that's why i'm asking everyone this literally has nothing to do
[3:54:23.360 --> 3:54:30.480]  our stand with whether you believe in the vaccination or not this is truly about your right
[3:54:30.480 --> 3:54:38.480]  to choose to be free in this country and not be mandated by some bureaucracy or elected official
[3:54:38.480 --> 3:54:46.320]  that we put there they do not have anybody to tell me what to do to mandate my health care
[3:54:46.960 --> 3:54:51.920]  and so on and so that's what we're standing for and i'm asking everyone that's watching this
[3:54:52.720 --> 3:55:00.640]  get together with your unions with your with your co-workers with anybody because this this
[3:55:00.640 --> 3:55:08.400]  is the time to stand and you know what doing the job that i do i have this platform and i'm
[3:55:08.400 --> 3:55:17.920]  going to use it and i will be vocal i will not lie down i submit to this journey how can people
[3:55:17.920 --> 3:55:23.360]  help you you guys have hired attorneys you need uh you need monetary help help these guys get the
[3:55:23.360 --> 3:55:29.840]  attorneys um right into the game to help them do this and and i absolutely believe that if we have
[3:55:29.840 --> 3:55:35.280]  counties rising up industries rising up people saying you know what my liberty is more important
[3:55:35.280 --> 3:55:42.080]  than my paycheck right now i really do think i think god blesses people that stand up for truth
[3:55:42.080 --> 3:55:47.920]  and you're right this is all about the force of the shot and people that are vaccinated and people
[3:55:47.920 --> 3:55:53.120]  that are unvaccinated all need to come together to fight for the very right to not be forced to
[3:55:53.120 --> 3:55:58.560]  have an injection placed into your body can you imagine our kids how many shots are they going
[3:55:58.560 --> 3:56:03.280]  to be up against you know a thousand shots in their lifetime who knows i don't know what they
[3:56:03.280 --> 3:56:07.120]  have in store but this is scary stuff and i love that you're taking a stand can you give us the

[3:57:49.040 --> 3:57:55.120]  and there is plenty to be afraid of today half the population has lined up for an untested deadly
[3:57:55.120 --> 3:57:59.840]  and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible
[3:57:59.840 --> 3:58:05.760]  asymptomatic disease the perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80 percent
[3:58:05.760 --> 3:58:11.600]  of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years
[3:58:11.600 --> 3:58:16.240]  for those of us who have awoken from the spell we know this is all really happening and it's
[3:58:16.240 --> 3:58:22.560]  unbelievably unsettling to see but there is only two things to do we continue sounding the alarm
[3:58:22.560 --> 3:58:27.760]  because it's a numbers game if enough people awaken from the cold spell then we win but even
[3:58:27.760 --> 3:58:33.360]  when we win and we eventually will the days of convenience are soon coming to an end and so
