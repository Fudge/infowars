[00:00.000 --> 00:16.920]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[00:30.000 --> 00:42.680]  Ladies and gentlemen we are live broadcasting worldwide from deep in the heart of Texas
[00:42.680 --> 00:53.440]  Austin on this Tuesday October 3rd 2017 global transmission absolute total war has been declared
[00:53.440 --> 00:59.080]  against the Second Amendment the Democratic Party and their mouthpieces like Jimmy Kimmel and
[00:59.080 --> 01:05.920]  others are calling for the total abolition of citizens owning firearms and Keith Oberman is
[01:05.920 --> 01:12.840]  calling gun owners terrorist he says the NRA is a terrorist organization and by extension all gun
[01:12.840 --> 01:18.240]  owners are to blame for this attack even though they don't even really report on the daily
[01:18.240 --> 01:25.160]  Islamic attacks in the US Canada Europe with people screaming Allah Akbar then it's never
[01:25.160 --> 01:31.000]  Islam's fault here's what we know and we're gonna have breaking news coming up at the bottom of
[01:31.000 --> 01:37.800]  the hour all the evidence points towards Islamic connections and we have ISIS even the Associated
[01:37.800 --> 01:45.200]  Press admits that generally only takes credit for things they've actually done and they are
[01:45.200 --> 01:50.040]  taking credit and talking about his Islamic name and all the things that he was involved in the
[01:50.040 --> 01:57.240]  things that the supposed shooter was doing that said he had a lot of investments his girlfriend
[01:57.240 --> 02:02.680]  of many years was traveling back and forth the Middle East we know that the Islamists will a
[02:02.680 --> 02:08.720]  lot of times give people a lot of money if they promise to then carry out an attack down the road
[02:08.720 --> 02:12.560]  and the big question and I've been talking to a lot of intelligence operatives and really smart
[02:12.560 --> 02:20.040]  people and they concur with my research and the fact that we're pointing towards the fact that he
[02:20.040 --> 02:27.080]  was paying his gambling debts getting some type of Islamic funding and that again in the last two
[02:27.080 --> 02:34.720]  months he'd openly converted to Islam he was known by police in the area and our sources in the
[02:34.720 --> 02:41.440]  hostage rescue team and this this comes from sources directly inside the hostage rescue team
[02:41.440 --> 02:49.000]  not the team that went in to assist police but folks that work with those very people that there
[02:49.000 --> 02:55.480]  was some firing going on and some confusion and they believe that they actually killed him and
[02:55.480 --> 03:04.960]  that once inside there was just anti-fut literature and garbage piled up basically and that also
[03:04.960 --> 03:12.840]  connections to the Middle East and literature and information we know the left is wedded to Islam
[03:12.840 --> 03:20.480]  and using them as their enforcers so this is just incredible to have the media coming out
[03:20.480 --> 03:27.080]  yesterday and saying ISIS takes responsibility and here's his Islamic name and they say they were
[03:27.080 --> 03:31.920]  in contact with him for a long time and he converted two months ago and his girlfriend's
[03:31.920 --> 03:36.360]  going to Dubai and all the rest of this stuff and he's got all this investment money now we
[03:36.360 --> 03:40.840]  learn millions of dollars coming in from weird sources not just hundreds of thousands a year
[03:40.840 --> 03:48.560]  and he's connected in with the skunk works and Lockheed Martin this whole thing has a lot of
[03:48.560 --> 03:54.480]  questions and so I questioned this yesterday and said look ISIS claims Vegas shooting
[03:54.480 --> 04:02.760]  responsibility says Stephen Paddock converted to Islam now hours later Newsweek came out with
[04:02.760 --> 04:08.640]  this headline this was picked up in publications across the country corporate fake news that I
[04:08.640 --> 04:20.400]  made up that I made up the entire ISIS claiming responsibility even though it was in thousands
[04:20.400 --> 04:26.840]  of publications and that my reporting on it was made up and they mix in a bunch of stuff I didn't
[04:26.840 --> 04:32.960]  say out of context and then I'm sitting across the breakfast table from my wife this morning she's
[04:32.960 --> 04:37.600]  reading the New York Times saying myself and others put out fake news saying ISIS took
[04:37.600 --> 04:42.240]  responsibility so they want to cover up ISIS taking responsibility to the point they're now
[04:42.240 --> 04:48.760]  saying it never happened you talk about fake news they are desperate just like San Bernardino day
[04:48.760 --> 04:53.240]  one we said it was Islamic took three days for it to come out they are fighting to cover this up
[04:53.240 --> 05:01.280]  and Trump isn't in control the Justice Department of the FBI and they're covering it up all the
[05:01.280 --> 05:06.960]  perplexities the confusion and distress in America arise not from objects in their constitution or
[05:06.960 --> 05:12.440]  confederation not from want of honor or virtue so much as from the downright ignorance of the
[05:12.440 --> 05:17.960]  nature of coin credit and circulation those are the words of John Adams the second president of
[05:17.960 --> 05:22.840]  the United States are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve do you understand the nature of
[05:22.840 --> 05:28.560]  our fiat currency do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and
[05:28.560 --> 05:33.680]  bust cycles and a profit from it what kind of leverage do these people in the Federal Reserve
[05:33.680 --> 05:39.080]  have over the American people or for that matter what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over
[05:39.080 --> 05:44.920]  our money will you be a slave or will you be free Adams also said liberty cannot be preserved
[05:44.920 --> 05:50.600]  without general knowledge among the people join the info wars spread the information educate
[05:50.600 --> 05:55.760]  yourself and others the truth shall set you free grandfather wars dot com i'm david night
[06:02.760 --> 06:11.080]  you are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report if you are receiving this
[06:11.080 --> 06:25.640]  transmission you are the resistance from deep in the heart of fema region six austin texas
[06:25.640 --> 06:34.960]  transmitting worldwide it's alex jones here's what we know on this october 3rd 2017 tuesday
[06:34.960 --> 06:44.520]  worldwide broadcast the left from phil mud deputy director of the cia the former director of the
[06:44.520 --> 06:56.160]  cia brennan to al gore to all of them basically have gone on national television and said
[06:56.160 --> 07:02.440]  trump will soon be removed there's going to be a violent revolution in america slash arab spring
[07:02.440 --> 07:10.720]  now newsweek has tried to deceive the public putting on an article attacking me titled alex
[07:10.720 --> 07:17.200]  jones says the deep state is behind the los vegas attack and then they come out and say jones
[07:17.200 --> 07:24.840]  made it up claiming that isis had taken responsibility and they say that isis never
[07:24.840 --> 07:34.040]  took responsibility this is the next level lies hours before newsweek itself ran the headline
[07:34.040 --> 07:40.680]  we can put that on screen that isis took responsibility and they released the islamic name
[07:41.480 --> 07:49.080]  that he went under now think about that and it's in the new york times today and it's in the
[07:49.080 --> 07:59.240]  washington post it's everywhere reporting that fake news made it up they're not even saying isis
[07:59.240 --> 08:05.320]  ever said it they're saying fake news made it up no the official isis encrypted website put it out
[08:05.320 --> 08:11.640]  the fbi reported it that is confirmed so they now aren't engaged in such incredible fake news
[08:11.640 --> 08:19.480]  an awesome level deception that they're just moving on and not saying well we question isis
[08:19.480 --> 08:22.920]  taking responsibility because that gives you motive you've got his girlfriend going to the
[08:22.920 --> 08:26.760]  middle east you've got him at deep in debt but getting millions of dollars nobody knows where
[08:26.760 --> 08:34.040]  the money came from that's what isis and al-qaeda and folks do is they pay people to carry out
[08:34.040 --> 08:38.200]  shooting attacks stabbing attacks and bombing attacks your family doesn't have money you're in
[08:38.200 --> 08:43.880]  palestine israel they'll give you two hundred thousand dollars you go stab some people they'll
[08:43.880 --> 08:48.040]  shoot some people they'll pay even more if a suicide bombing ends up killing a hundred people
[08:48.040 --> 08:56.200]  they might give you a million dollars that's how hamas that's how hezbollah that's how the plo
[08:56.200 --> 09:02.600]  that's how all these groups finance the terrorist that's what they do and so the media keeps saying
[09:02.600 --> 09:12.200]  we don't know a motive we have no idea we have just no inkling in our minds of why this happened
[09:12.200 --> 09:24.680]  or why any of this is going on zero absolute total zero here's nbc news los vegas shooting
[09:24.680 --> 09:33.800]  isis claim of responsibility and it goes on to say abu abed el bar there's a supposed name
[09:34.360 --> 09:41.960]  abu abed el bar now first they said okay isis even the associated press said normally when
[09:41.960 --> 09:54.200]  isis takes responsibility it's real then they started spinning it uh into oh it's a sign of
[09:54.200 --> 10:03.720]  desperation by isis to claim responsibility that was by about three o'clock and by four o'clock
[10:03.720 --> 10:15.080]  central time yesterday there was a new headline out that i had completely and totally made the
[10:15.080 --> 10:22.200]  whole thing up with no proof so that's the evolution of their deceptions ladies and gentlemen
[10:22.200 --> 10:28.040]  meanwhile there's new articles breaking today daily mail isis releases a new video bragging
[10:28.040 --> 10:34.920]  that los vegas shooting is revenge for us attack against their caliphate now here's the issue
[10:36.360 --> 10:41.960]  if the media of the control corporate media wants to question whether isis taken responsibility
[10:44.040 --> 10:49.640]  whether that's true or not that's one thing but it's another thing to again engage in total
[10:49.640 --> 10:55.880]  deception and say that it's made up they never took responsibility i just showed you of your
[10:55.880 --> 11:01.800]  tv viewer two different newsweek articles one saying isis took responsibility we all heard
[11:01.800 --> 11:05.720]  that yesterday morning it was all over every newspaper it was all over every website it was
[11:05.720 --> 11:12.520]  all over talk radio it was all over cbs news nbc news cnn all of it and then within hours it's not
[11:12.520 --> 11:17.800]  even true they never took responsibility but they never retract the old articles and never show how
[11:17.800 --> 11:26.920]  it wasn't true the way they retract is claiming i made it up you understand that deception now the
[11:26.920 --> 11:32.360]  president is already dealing with their last load of lies from a few days before where he's in
[11:32.360 --> 11:39.720]  san juan just landed 20 minutes ago we've had food and supplies stacked up to the sky for
[11:39.720 --> 11:46.600]  almost two weeks they've been hit by well two hurricanes broadside another one grazed them
[11:46.600 --> 11:52.200]  them they've been loading it up with food they've got 10 000 plus containers at just a few of the
[11:52.200 --> 11:59.800]  ports alone air conditioned containers food medicine water generators everything they need
[12:01.000 --> 12:05.880]  and we now know the mayor ordered to stand down we now know the democrat run teamsters
[12:05.880 --> 12:10.760]  who control 80 percent of trucking blocked it and have gone on tv and admit it wow
[12:10.760 --> 12:17.880]  wow that is the next level psychological war we're under and that's the whole point
[12:18.680 --> 12:27.480]  they're on the news on controlled corporate media on enemy media saying that all gun owners
[12:27.480 --> 12:33.720]  are to blame for this attack and putting the guilt on you incredible propaganda incredible
[12:33.720 --> 12:40.440]  bullying but they are the ones that have been building up for a year intensely revolution
[12:40.440 --> 12:43.640]  even if hillary got in they were gonna have a revolution and put everybody in their place
[12:43.640 --> 12:47.640]  and in the free press and alex jones was the example of who had to be shut down
[12:49.800 --> 12:54.120]  and now trump got in so we've got a beachhead they're panicking but they're going ahead with
[12:54.120 --> 12:58.520]  their operations and they said starting in october and right through november we're going to start
[12:58.520 --> 13:04.120]  killing conservatives we're going to start killing white people mainly white people saying that and
[13:04.120 --> 13:09.960]  pushing it 90 percent of the time because i don't want to report what they're saying and act like
[13:09.960 --> 13:14.200]  it's black folks are hispanics that are doing it it is you've seen the videos everywhere i've been
[13:14.200 --> 13:20.760]  there 90 percent of the time in fact 95 percent of the time it's white people there weren't any
[13:20.760 --> 13:25.160]  black people or hispanics or asians attacking me when i was in seattle with hot coffee or
[13:25.160 --> 13:31.880]  trying to punch me or spitting at me it was all white people because it's a weird whacked out
[13:31.880 --> 13:35.400]  thing where i guess they used to be racist or something and now they've flipped to the other
[13:35.400 --> 13:40.360]  side so now they hate themselves and hate all white people i mean it's marlith or king would
[13:40.360 --> 13:44.840]  say that's a crazy racist right there a crazy white racist that hates white people so you see
[13:44.840 --> 13:50.600]  them frothing saying we're coming to kill you we're learning how to use weapons we're learning
[13:50.600 --> 13:56.520]  how to come after you i was on the air sunday night saying i've been to major shooting ranges
[13:57.400 --> 14:02.920]  and they tell me the biggest group they've got is liberals preparing for civil war against the american
[14:02.920 --> 14:10.440]  people i said that friday night four to six p.m with matt bracken the navy seal counterterrorism
[14:10.440 --> 14:16.040]  expert on and we said i'm surprised there hadn't been a terror attack yet today other than the two
[14:16.040 --> 14:21.720]  we saw screaming on the oct bar in canada and in france and then hours later it happened and
[14:21.720 --> 14:26.600]  bracken's on air saying i think they'll shoot into a rock concert or a football game
[14:26.600 --> 14:34.120]  and use that attack either on a right-wing patsy or on somebody else to trigger a civil war and
[14:34.120 --> 14:43.640]  it happened hours later if you want to know why they are coming after us ladies and gentlemen
[14:45.880 --> 14:47.160]  if you want to know why
[14:49.720 --> 14:54.520]  it's because we actually study this we know what we're talking about and i've got sources ladies
[14:54.520 --> 14:59.560]  and gentlemen that and they know my sources included the president of the united states
[15:00.280 --> 15:04.200]  and they've moved heaven and earth and mainstream news admitting trying to get general kelly to
[15:04.200 --> 15:09.480]  block my information from getting to his desk i mean i can pick up the phone and i can call
[15:09.480 --> 15:14.840]  20 different people at every level of the cia i could pick up the phone and call the fbi federal

[15:22.040 --> 15:27.080]  i'm going to break at the bottom of the hour with a kit daniels article that is about to go up
[15:28.120 --> 15:35.400]  that shows massive connections in absolutely bolstering and augmenting the argument
[15:35.400 --> 15:42.760]  that this guy was an islamicist or an islamicist patsy being handled and set up to pay off gambling
[15:42.760 --> 15:48.360]  debts that were being paid out of the middle east for him to carry out this attack or to at least

[20:57.240 --> 21:05.960]  prison planet dot com and info wars dot com right now so here's the information we have
[21:05.960 --> 21:13.400]  right now ladies and gentlemen american gun owners cannot back down in the face of the sustained
[21:13.400 --> 21:19.080]  demonization of the second amendment and you notice all the mass shootings that still statistically
[21:19.080 --> 21:26.520]  are a very rare way to die cannot get us to give up our guns because we understand if some islamic
[21:26.520 --> 21:31.800]  crisis runs over a group of people with a car and kills 20 something people you don't then say
[21:31.800 --> 21:39.640]  aren't car drivers insensitive for still having their cars no it's a bad person using a tool
[21:39.640 --> 21:47.640]  to do that if somebody dumps cyanide in the water supply the lake isn't bad and you're not insensitive
[21:47.640 --> 21:52.040]  if you're watching people in another country dying by the thousands from cyanide poisoning
[21:52.040 --> 21:58.840]  in the water you're not bad when you drink water the water is not bad somebody put poison in it
[21:59.720 --> 22:06.760]  guns are tools guns are resources as well and everywhere we've seen guns we've seen crime
[22:06.760 --> 22:12.040]  drop except for areas like chicago new york dc where they restrict the law abiding having the
[22:12.040 --> 22:16.600]  guns the crime rates have precipitously exploded there and i know our audience knows that
[22:16.600 --> 22:23.000]  but within minutes hillary did her customary double speak on twitter and said i don't want
[22:23.000 --> 22:27.480]  to get political and partisan now's not the time but the nra and the republicans are to blame
[22:30.440 --> 22:37.880]  so we've got close to 60 people dead hundreds and hundreds over 500 wounded but still more than 100
[22:37.880 --> 22:43.960]  people die every day on america's highways are we gonna ban cars well they're trying saying hey
[22:43.960 --> 22:51.080]  let it all be driverless it'll be safer hell don't ever be born then you'll never die don't ever rock
[22:51.080 --> 22:56.840]  climb don't play dodgeball don't play contact sports that's where this is going and you've
[22:56.840 --> 23:07.080]  got jimmy kimmel the dirt bag who admittedly is the creature the minion of chuckie schumer
[23:07.080 --> 23:14.360]  meeting with him on the health care debacle on that scam propping up the scam that's obama care
[23:14.360 --> 23:20.040]  the bipartisan fraud that's obama care and now going after the guns crying last night
[23:20.040 --> 23:26.040]  with his fake tears saying take all the guns and blaming american gun owners and blaming the nra
[23:27.480 --> 23:33.480]  doesn't they attack nra they mean you and me and all of us it turns out there's photos and videos
[23:33.480 --> 23:40.680]  of his armed security everywhere he goes packing nine millimeters forties and ten millimeters
[23:40.680 --> 23:47.240]  on their hips that's right under their shirts he has up to eight security people when he goes to
[23:47.240 --> 23:52.280]  dinner or anywhere else i'm not going to spend the money i've got for that i'm going to spend this
[23:52.280 --> 23:56.120]  operation i'm not going to have six seven security people with me at all times i've got to have some
[23:56.120 --> 24:03.720]  now but the real security is right here so how is it different if i have this glock
[24:06.760 --> 24:12.840]  and an m4 right here to defend myself somebody comes in here but then when he has guys off in
[24:12.840 --> 24:17.800]  the shadows with guns then it's okay because see they're the state or they're the specially licensed
[24:17.800 --> 24:22.920]  people oh so just when only they have the guns you end up having tyranny because they always end
[24:22.920 --> 24:27.880]  up taking over like any banana republic country but i know everybody knows that in this audience
[24:28.680 --> 24:34.600]  well we've won the information war when it comes down to that the left knows it so they're all going
[24:34.600 --> 24:41.240]  to gun ranges getting guns and training to come after us and saying they're going to kill us and
[24:41.240 --> 24:48.840]  then we see a country music venue of mainly white people hit and then they say we don't know a motive
[24:48.840 --> 24:52.760]  when isis takes responsibility when the guy's girlfriend's going to the middle east when the
[24:52.760 --> 24:57.320]  guys got all these debts when the hotel's owned by a big globalist leftist that gives money to
[24:57.320 --> 25:03.480]  cop killer groups reportedly and left us anti for groups clearly there's cameras in every hallway
[25:03.480 --> 25:09.960]  you do anything even halfway suspicious they come uh my own one of my own bodyguards was out in
[25:09.960 --> 25:13.960]  vegas years ago and the maid went through his underwear drawer found his firearm and then
[25:13.960 --> 25:18.120]  tried to claim it wasn't properly serial number registered but it was through the company he was
[25:18.120 --> 25:24.680]  working for but they did try to take him to jail the point is they dig through everything in your
[25:24.680 --> 25:31.320]  hotel there in vegas it happens in all major chains but in vegas they go through everything in your
[25:31.320 --> 25:37.080]  pill chest they go through everything in your toiletries they go through all your clothes they
[25:37.080 --> 25:41.480]  go through what you're reading they thumb through your books to make sure they're not hollow books
[25:41.480 --> 25:47.240]  they do a security sweep and they have cameras more in vegas than anywhere else in a private area
[25:47.240 --> 25:56.520]  and for five days this guy supposedly hauled get ready for it 40 plus firearms up into the room
[25:56.520 --> 26:02.520]  and thousands of rounds of ammunition with maids coming in and out when they see do not disturb
[26:02.520 --> 26:07.960]  on your door for more than a day they come in when you first get there they do a sweep the minute
[26:07.960 --> 26:15.320]  you leave they do that in every major hotel especially casinos you're in a suite for five
[26:15.320 --> 26:24.040]  days of lugging 40 firearms in there and nobody knew it was coming nobody knew it was happening
[26:24.040 --> 26:28.280]  and of course they got every manufactured type you can imagine of semi-auto and of different
[26:28.280 --> 26:34.200]  conversions to be able to ban all of those you can see the whole cutout that comes from really
[26:34.200 --> 26:42.040]  smart people and my own research so law enforcement isn't buying any of this the military is not buying
[26:42.040 --> 26:47.800]  it security personnel aren't buying it the hostage rescue team the fbi isn't buying it low level but
[26:47.800 --> 26:53.640]  high level the fbi's got people out politically demonizing the second amendment active duty
[26:53.640 --> 27:00.360]  current high-level fbi because trump hasn't culled all those people out you've got the clintons and
[27:00.360 --> 27:08.440]  the bushes and then obama you've got close to 20 years ladies and gentlemen of them being able to
[27:08.440 --> 27:14.600]  put all of the people they want into place in all these positions the government's full of
[27:14.600 --> 27:23.160]  reality winners the government's full of you know this this this this lieutenant from west point
[27:23.160 --> 27:29.160]  saying the violent communist revolutions coming soon so what do they do well they take out a
[27:29.160 --> 27:33.240]  bunch of christians they take out a bunch of conservatives and then they blame it on the
[27:33.240 --> 27:39.000]  very same group and even mainstream media says cnn i've got the clip well this was mainly trump
[27:39.000 --> 27:45.000]  supporters that got shot so i guess they deserve it and the deputy head of cbs had to resign yesterday
[27:45.000 --> 27:49.640]  because she said i don't feel sorry for them they deserve it because they're christians and they're
[27:49.640 --> 27:57.000]  trump supporters that listen to country music bigoted and hateful and sickening and in your face
[27:57.000 --> 28:03.560]  like you're a moron they said they're coming with a revolution they said they're going to get violent
[28:03.560 --> 28:08.280]  they said they're going to go after us but they're going to do it where they attack us and then blame
[28:08.280 --> 28:15.080]  us for the very attack they've carried out and you know it's the season they said they were going
[28:15.080 --> 28:22.680]  to do it they said it was coming october 1st and then they give you the biggest massacre in us history
[28:22.680 --> 28:29.160]  using firearms so they can try to counter our revolution to take the country back it's ridiculously
[28:29.160 --> 28:36.600]  obvious it's sickeningly right out in the open it's overwhelming isis taking responsibility
[28:36.600 --> 28:43.400]  the guys live in wife uh you know his his his common law wife going to the middle east and he's in
[28:43.400 --> 28:48.200]  all these debts get millions of dollars from nowhere unbelievably obvious what went on he
[28:48.200 --> 28:52.680]  either did it or he was set up as the patchy in it and then they say we don't have a motive

[33:28.280 --> 33:29.240]  you
[33:35.880 --> 33:43.720]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[33:45.480 --> 33:45.720]  so
[33:48.520 --> 33:53.240]  as soon as i announced 15 minutes ago that at the bottom of the hour where we are right now
[33:53.240 --> 34:01.880]  11 33 central time that we were going to be posting more evidence of antifa working with radical
[34:01.880 --> 34:11.720]  islam and connections to the reported mass shooter suspect in vegas as soon as that happened our
[34:11.720 --> 34:18.200]  it people called another state we've got some here as well and said we've got a giant bot attack
[34:18.200 --> 34:23.560]  that just started on the site we're talking within minutes of me announcing it trying to bring down
[34:23.560 --> 34:29.160]  info wars dot com so that site is up and down we were barely able to even upload this report
[34:29.880 --> 34:36.920]  news wars dot com is having it uploaded to it right now as a backup as well as prison planet
[34:36.920 --> 34:43.640]  dot com but i've been running around like a chicken with my head cut off working on this and having
[34:43.640 --> 34:50.280]  other sources give me information but here's what we know right now they've gone to total
[34:50.280 --> 34:55.400]  disinformation level and that tells you this is a major operation what we just witnessed
[34:55.400 --> 35:03.720]  and when everybody can smell coming out of the tragic events in nevada there in los vegas again
[35:03.720 --> 35:07.960]  they announced in the morning that isa said officially on their website and on their own
[35:07.960 --> 35:15.640]  encrypted site uh taken responsibility for it and even gave out the islamic name of the reported
[35:15.640 --> 35:27.640]  shooter then within hours the media came out and said alex jones made it up they said it
[35:27.640 --> 35:34.280]  hundreds of publications alex jones made it up ices never took responsibility now the fbi
[35:34.280 --> 35:39.320]  officially said that ices came out and took responsibility the british government came out
[35:39.320 --> 35:43.640]  they did it on their official website the media just totally is lying to the public
[35:44.440 --> 35:50.200]  they've chosen me to be the symbol of fake news and so they say oh it's alex jones he says it's
[35:50.200 --> 35:56.360]  deep state working with ices and ices never took responsibility and then now today the new york
[35:56.360 --> 36:03.720]  time says it's not true fake news reported ices did it they're not saying ices is wrong or ices
[36:03.720 --> 36:11.960]  is lying they're just saying it never happened now what does that tell you they don't want
[36:11.960 --> 36:19.800]  there to be a debate about this they don't want you to know that
[36:22.520 --> 36:28.680]  individuals organizations have come out and taken credit for it they want to say we don't
[36:28.680 --> 36:35.320]  know what happened when a giant concert full of 23 000 people 80 plus percent of them white
[36:35.320 --> 36:41.240]  get targeted when the left says we're coming in october to start killing whites and trump
[36:41.240 --> 36:45.320]  supporters and we're going to overthrow the government and we're getting armed and we're
[36:45.320 --> 36:51.560]  getting ready and in and in meeting halls all over the country doug hagman's exposed it
[36:51.560 --> 36:57.160]  steven crawler's exposed it paul watson's exposed it drudge reports exposed it project veratox
[36:57.160 --> 37:03.560]  has exposed it we have all exposed it and info wars has shown the videos and shown the articles
[37:03.560 --> 37:08.360]  and shown where they say they're doing it i go to gun ranges to get intel they say yeah
[37:09.160 --> 37:14.760]  most our business now isn't libertarians or conservatives it's liberals in here preparing
[37:14.760 --> 37:22.920]  for a civil war and there's just women with the jibs everywhere firing full auto and semi auto
[37:22.920 --> 37:29.160]  because they're these are gun ranges where you can rent the guns and do it so new doomsdayers
[37:29.160 --> 37:35.400]  taking up arms and prepping for catastrophe are the american liberals there's that article
[37:37.880 --> 37:46.120]  but i'm going to do this right now i'm going to get into some of the other news and we come back
[37:46.120 --> 37:51.160]  at the start of the next segment i'm going to get into the middle eastern connections and the evidence
[37:51.160 --> 37:55.320]  piling up there that they don't want you to discuss all the media plays dumb just like they
[37:55.320 --> 38:01.640]  did to the pulse nightclub just like they did sand bernadino they wouldn't say for three plus years
[38:01.640 --> 38:10.280]  that major hassan killing 13 people at fort hood was an islamic attack even though he was in contact
[38:10.280 --> 38:17.720]  with al qaeda and with all their top people and was planning it for two years and the cia knew
[38:17.720 --> 38:24.600]  and did nothing and let the army psychologist prepare his attack and when there's an attack
[38:24.600 --> 38:30.520]  they tell you it's not islamic and it took years to have the army be reversed and have to admit it
[38:30.520 --> 38:36.360]  because of lawsuits for hoods shoulder and a doll asan petitions to be a citizen of islamic state
[38:37.320 --> 38:44.200]  but he's not involved with islam and it wasn't an islamic terror attack because the fbi run by
[38:44.200 --> 38:49.880]  miller at the time and the cia run by brennan converted to wahhabism tells you islamic terror
[38:49.880 --> 38:56.600]  doesn't exist in the official fbi manuals until trump got in nine months ago and now it does
[38:57.880 --> 39:04.840]  so a group that tells you islamic terror doesn't exist remember obama would say hold on
[39:05.480 --> 39:11.000]  the zelkata attacks they're not in islam that's not islamic the media would say yes sir we're
[39:11.000 --> 39:18.200]  now little parrots islamic terror doesn't exist and water doesn't exist and the sky doesn't exist
[39:19.480 --> 39:25.560]  and i'm not wearing a blue jacket and a white shirt i mean this is the level of course they're
[39:25.560 --> 39:32.120]  covering it up of course they're covering up the fact that there's these islamic connections
[39:32.120 --> 39:35.720]  does that mean it's absolutely islamic does that mean it's open and shut does that mean
[39:35.720 --> 39:43.960]  it's case closed no but the history the motive the left working with them antifa working with them
[39:43.960 --> 39:49.960]  this whole constellation of information and the government's history of covering it up
[39:50.680 --> 39:57.000]  and the time frame we're in and everything we've witnessed i told you they're gonna start mass
[39:57.000 --> 40:01.400]  shootings all over the country they're gonna blame conservatives they're gonna blame libertarians
[40:01.400 --> 40:12.200]  when it's their people doing it as the pretext and it won't matter how much evidence it's a leftist
[40:12.200 --> 40:17.560]  it won't matter if it's islamic they're gonna say the nra and american gun owners are terrorists
[40:17.560 --> 40:27.560]  and you are to blame shame on you and whether it is cbs news or cnn or abc news or msnbc or even
[40:27.560 --> 40:35.160]  fox news is like cnn light now it's unwatchable put cnn was like 10 years ago they're all saying

[43:00.920 --> 43:06.760]  where an excess of power prevails property of no sort is duly respected no man is safe in his
[43:06.760 --> 43:12.760]  opinions in his person in his faculties or in his possessions is there any question that we have an
[43:12.760 --> 43:17.960]  excess of power in washington the only question is how do we contain it and how do we remove that
[43:17.960 --> 43:24.040]  power from washington to our local communities to the individual that is the ultimate concern the
[43:24.040 --> 43:29.720]  concentration of power the excess of power was always the chief concern of the founders of this
[43:29.720 --> 43:34.120]  country it was why the anti-fiddle is to pose the constitution they believe they put safeguards
[43:34.120 --> 43:38.760]  in the constitution to abuse that concentration of power but as james madison also pointed out
[43:38.760 --> 43:44.840]  knowledge will forever govern ignorance of people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves

[47:41.000 --> 47:45.560]  reported photo of the shooter and it looks like the floor from the videos i've seen
[47:45.560 --> 47:52.280]  and the photo looks real a photo of the reported uh shooter he may be a patsy he may be a cutout
[47:52.280 --> 48:00.520]  but we're going to tweet that at real alex jones on twitter coming up here in just a few minutes
[48:01.480 --> 48:08.760]  now that said ladies and gentlemen when we're looking at the current atmosphere you have the
[48:08.760 --> 48:13.160]  left saying in october november we're going to launch massive attacks we're getting weapons
[48:13.160 --> 48:16.520]  we're going to shoot you we're going to kill you we're going to kill the president we're
[48:16.520 --> 48:20.520]  going to kill the supporters we're going to kill the media we're going to kill congress
[48:20.520 --> 48:26.280]  hashtag hunt republicans uh they have wolf blitzer saying hey the guy that you know went out there
[48:26.280 --> 48:31.080]  and shot people uh at the baseball field you know he did this because he was politically upset
[48:33.720 --> 48:39.240]  that's what's happening there is a worldwide advance of antifa the antifa fascist activist
[48:39.240 --> 48:46.760]  movement and there is an exclusive story on news wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[48:46.760 --> 48:54.200]  report antifa receiving military training in syria vegas shooter's girlfriend traveled to
[48:54.200 --> 49:04.040]  the middle east and this breaks down the photos the videos and more of how different islamic
[49:04.040 --> 49:09.640]  groups from the Kurds to the wahhabis to you name it have been actively working with the left in
[49:09.640 --> 49:16.280]  america and have been tracked paying for american antifa operations and giving them the training
[49:16.280 --> 49:21.880]  they need to carry out attacks and that these particular groups that have been identified
[49:21.880 --> 49:28.520]  are muslims with communist affiliations particularly the Kurds editors know just like the pulse
[49:28.520 --> 49:34.280]  nightclub massacre the sambaradino attack and the 2009 fort hood shooting the mainstream media is
[49:34.280 --> 49:39.240]  doing everything it can to cover up the connection between islamic terrorism and major massacres on
[49:39.240 --> 49:46.040]  us soil that's a fact they've done it over and over again isis claim responsibility the associated
[49:46.040 --> 49:50.440]  press said yesterday morning isis is almost always accurate when it claims responsibility
[49:51.560 --> 49:57.480]  they don't reclaim responsibility when they haven't done it then by afternoon they said it was made up
[49:57.480 --> 50:04.840]  by me with no proof they said jones claims isis is involved with deep state well we know the
[50:04.840 --> 50:09.320]  deep state that trump can't kick out ran the whole arab spring and the rest of it that's a fact
[50:10.040 --> 50:15.000]  so just like the pulse nightclub massacre the sambaradino attack for uh in california
[50:15.000 --> 50:20.360]  2004 shooting the mainstream media is doing everything it can to cover up the connection
[50:20.360 --> 50:26.600]  when islamic terrorism and major massacres on us soil establishment reporters are even claiming
[50:26.600 --> 50:31.960]  it's fake news that isis took responsibility for the attack even though they did take responsibility
[50:31.960 --> 50:38.200]  for the attack the following article reveals the dark triad of antifa Kurdish members of isis
[50:38.200 --> 50:44.920]  and anarcho-communist Kurds and by implication why a country music festival the bastion of flyover
[50:44.920 --> 50:51.880]  country americana was targeted for background read this related article first fbi source vegas
[50:51.880 --> 50:56.920]  shooter found with antifa literature photos taken in middle east that was later confirmed after we
[50:56.920 --> 51:02.520]  broke that that she was in the middle east the photos members of antifa are illegally crossing
[51:02.520 --> 51:08.040]  the syrian border to receive military training from Kurdish militants as part of a dark trial between
[51:08.040 --> 51:15.160]  antifa anarcho-communist Kurds and Kurdish members of isis the us back Kurdish people's protection
[51:15.160 --> 51:21.560]  units ypg has anarcho-communist politics which also attracted american and european antifa to
[51:21.560 --> 51:27.160]  fight alongside them in what they refer to as the rojova revolution that's been in the news
[51:27.800 --> 51:32.760]  security agencies are concerned that these antifa members will continue the revolution home once
[51:32.760 --> 51:37.960]  they return already fbi sources have received antifa literature and photos taken in the middle
[51:37.960 --> 51:43.400]  east which were found in the hotel room of the suspected los vegas shooter steven paddock
[51:49.240 --> 51:53.880]  and i'm going to show you the photo right now reportedly taken in the hotel room of the reported
[51:53.880 --> 51:57.720]  shooter it could clearly be a patchy taken up there and killed the folks that actually did it
[51:57.720 --> 52:06.120]  escaped but there is the gruesome photo looks real to me was it death by suicide massacre by
[52:06.120 --> 52:12.360]  suicide some type of fantasy deal like we've seen crozak heads before or was he radicalized
[52:12.360 --> 52:17.080]  by jihadis was he a leftist they're the ones calling for it saying hunt republicans where do
[52:17.080 --> 52:22.600]  you find a big group of them country music we're investigating and everything we're saying is very
[52:22.600 --> 52:27.640]  plausible historic basing reality the media is telling you they have no idea they don't know why
[52:27.640 --> 52:33.320]  you know if that had been a hip hop concert with a mainly urban population of black folks
[52:33.320 --> 52:40.200]  you know within minutes the media would say he was a white supremacist there to kill black
[52:40.200 --> 52:44.920]  people even if they never found a motive or ever had any evidence you'd hear that you'd never hear
[52:44.920 --> 52:49.960]  the end of it if the nfl game was attacked by a white guy you'd hear the same thing and that's
[52:49.960 --> 52:56.680]  what we're saying we think they'll probably pull but instead ladies and gentlemen instead we're
[52:56.680 --> 53:02.120]  sitting here looking at this and watching this unfold and they're all playing dumb as everyone
[53:02.120 --> 53:08.840]  searches for the motive the motive and the background has been found he has islamic connections they
[53:08.840 --> 53:15.880]  have made claims of responsibility isis has you have the media desperately trying to cover that up
[53:15.880 --> 53:24.520]  acting like it never even happened when it did but the fbi still run by the globalist says
[53:24.520 --> 53:30.280]  no link found even though our sources and it was later confirmed say she went to the middle east
[53:30.280 --> 53:34.680]  and there were photos of that and islamic literature inside along with anti-fug
[53:37.720 --> 53:42.680]  i mean you had them wearing hijabs you had the samberna dino attacker lady going to the
[53:42.680 --> 53:47.240]  middle east over and over again and they were going to try to say they weren't islamic in their
[53:47.240 --> 54:00.040]  attack that's how stupid they think every single one of us are i'm going to be open to
[54:00.040 --> 54:06.520]  phones up later in the broadcast to go over all of this but the report continues with the background
[54:06.520 --> 54:16.040]  the evidence how they're finding all over syria different rebel forces with the anti-fag linking
[54:16.040 --> 54:21.240]  up with the communist and saying that they're planning attacks inside the united states
[54:21.240 --> 54:30.440]  rolling stone interviewed international western leftists that are fighting for the ypg including
[54:30.440 --> 54:37.960]  americans and the fact that these anti-communist militants have women who are fighting isis
[54:37.960 --> 54:43.320]  is something that is often repeated anti-fag groups in europe and north america have posted
[54:43.320 --> 54:52.200]  photos of their fighters holding up the kurdish ypg flag along with the anti-fag flag in syria and
[54:52.200 --> 54:58.360]  that's just some of the news it goes on and on you definitely want to read the full report for
[54:58.360 --> 55:07.960]  yourself on news wars dot com and info wars dot com and the big one is the article kit daniels wrote
[55:07.960 --> 55:13.320]  that's linked first in the article vegas shooter found with anti-fag literature photos taken in the
[55:13.320 --> 55:17.720]  middle east fbi source and that's before it even came out that there were photos of her
[55:19.080 --> 55:22.920]  going to the middle east and all the rest of it and we're not saying that he's even the real guy
[55:22.920 --> 55:27.800]  is this to be a total cutout the point is look at the timing look at the left saying this was
[55:27.800 --> 55:33.160]  coming october 1st and the real launch being november 4th they have got their people geared up
[55:33.160 --> 55:36.920]  they've got them hyped up they've got them ready and they've got them prepared to strike
[55:36.920 --> 55:42.920]  and you've got jimmy kimmel meeting with schumer admittedly planning his political attack
[55:42.920 --> 55:48.520]  and the other talk show host they're using the teleprompter reading fake newsmen comedians
[55:48.520 --> 55:54.840]  as the new voice of the globalists because they know mainstream news is dead so now they just
[55:54.840 --> 55:59.960]  have emotional crying every couple nights from kimmel when he's not let's roll that video as we
[55:59.960 --> 56:07.240]  go to break here's kimmel with a model of a nine millimeter with a real pellet gun in

[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:07.960]  the truth about guns.com gun expert is going to be in studio coming up with us in 30 minutes
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:13.640]  michael steiner is going to be on with us uh and so much more and i'm going to get into all the lies
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:18.120]  as late night television openly declares war on the second amendment clearly the left is making
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:22.840]  their move to take down this country but first part of a powerful report that paul watson's put out
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:29.560]  the los vegas massacre what they're not telling you more than 50 people were killed and hundreds
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:34.760]  injured in the deadliest mass shooting in u.s history and the left which tells us to carry on
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:40.840]  as normal after every single islamic terror attack began screeching that we can't carry on as normal
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:45.480]  in this case and that new laws must be passed immediately gun control now enough already
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:50.280]  grow the the average person doesn't need a machine gun enough already enough enough yeah the average
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:55.880]  person doesn't have a machine gun because they're already banned before the bodies were even called
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:01:01.560]  hillary clinton seized on the tragedy to push for silences to be banned despite the fact that a fully
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:08.120]  auto machine gun used by the killer literally melt silences this had nothing whatsoever to do with
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:14.200]  silences put politics aside tweeted hillary while she literally made it all about politics in the
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:19.480]  very same sentence listen unless you've got a method of just spiriting away all the gun parts
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:25.720]  and all the guns in america in one single wish more gun laws aren't gonna stop this unless the
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:32.760]  fully auto was purchased before 1986 highly unlikely it was illegal anyway criminals and
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:38.440]  terrorists will find weapons whatever the law is because they don't abide by the law the isis
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:43.240]  terrorists who carried out the paris massacre were able to obtain semi-automatic weapons
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:49.000]  despite stringent gun control laws terrorists are stabbing people in france on an almost weekly
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:55.480]  basis do we ban knives last time i checked mass murder was already illegal was this an islamic
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:02:01.400]  terror attack carried out by a muslim convert senior u.s officials say no but isis itself says
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:06.920]  its own soldier carried out the massacre but isis claims responsibility for everything no that's
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:12.440]  not strictly true as the associated press reports isis is not known to have claimed any attacks
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:18.600]  to which it was not at least loosely linked for example the edmonton attack yesterday when a Somali
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:23.960]  migrant struck police and pedestrians with a vehicle isis didn't claim responsibility for that
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:28.760]  despite the fact that the terrorists supported isis and had an isis flag in the vehicle others
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:33.880]  say isis is getting desperate and only claiming responsibility for the attack to compensate for
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:39.160]  huge losses on the battlefield the shooter's family said they didn't talk to him much recently
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:44.600]  but that he wasn't political or religious but then again isis did warn that the las vegas strip
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:50.120]  was a target and surely this can't be someone who just went postal on a whim this was a well
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:56.040]  planned out long-distance attack that used an arsenal of weaponry and ammo and who was the woman
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:01.800]  described as hispanic that told concert goers they were about to die so there is a lady who
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:06.600]  pushed her way forward into the concert venue into the first row and she started messing with
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:12.920]  another lady and told us that we are all going to die tonight would you know why she was saying
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:18.120]  that i mean it was this after gush the shots were fired or it was about 45 minutes before the shots
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:23.000]  were actually fired but then she was escorted out by security that doesn't fit with the authorities
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:29.160]  claim that it was a lone wolf attack what we do know is that the shooter 64 year old steven paddock
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:34.440]  is white so obviously that must mean all white people are to blame right say the same people
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:39.560]  who will screen bloody murder when you talk about islamic terrorism and accuse you of collectively
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:45.080]  demonizing all muslims while they collectively demonize an entire race of people despite the
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:50.120]  fact that the event being a country music show undoubtedly means that the vast majority of
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:57.480]  victims are white people a fact that was celebrated by some on the far left including this cbs exec
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:03.640]  who said she had no sympathy because most of the victims were republicans it's the white supremacist
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:09.160]  patriarchy stupid yeah because if i was a white supremacist the first thing i target is that well
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:14.600]  known non-white venue a country music concert gun control debates that don't include disarming
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:20.280]  and increasingly militarized police force are garbage disarm the very people who stopped the massacre
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:26.440]  genius made genius number of americans killed on battlefields in all wars in history 1,396,733
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:34.600]  killed by firearms in the u.s since 1968 1,516,863 let that sink in number of unarmed civilians killed
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:41.000]  by governments in the 20th century alone 262 million let that sink in while trump passed the
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:47.240]  country to unite vox responded with this white american men are a bigger domestic terrorist
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:53.880]  threat and muslim foreigners one these figures don't include 9-11 two try importing millions of

[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:26.840]  ladies and gentlemen we're live broadcasting worldwide i am your host alex jones
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:35.160]  we have a special guest joining us in studio coming up the bottom of the hour if you just
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:41.560]  tuned in just like san bernadino just like ford hood uh just like the pulse night club
[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:47.720]  every time there's an islamic attack the fbi is ordered to say it's not an islamic attack
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:54.520]  and 90 percent of the fbi has been put in place the last 20 plus years that the clintons and the
[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:59.640]  obamas and others were in control it's a totally different culture where they hire people like
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:05.240]  reality winner with top secret clearances that hates all white people even though she's white
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:12.760]  and wants a violent communist revolution and joins isis so islamic state takes credit the ap
[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:18.680]  says that islamic state is generally truthful about things they take credit for and then the
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:24.200]  media just ignores that and now says it's fake news islamic state never did when they did take
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:31.240]  credit so the fact the media is ball faced lying shows they got something to cover up here like
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:38.680]  they do every time and the fbi is still very very political we had agents break ranks and san
[01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:43.640]  bernadino and other events and say no it was islamic they tried to say hassan killing 13 people
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:49.000]  was not islamic at ford hood even though he pledged allegiance to al qaeda and then he's
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:57.000]  done from his jail cell he's pledged allegiance to isis so that's what's going on they are
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:02.760]  desperately trying to keep everybody away from this first they say islamic state has said they
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:07.800]  did it they normally are very credible about that associated press then hours later well they
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:13.160]  said they did it but without proof and then now oh it's totally made up by alex jones that's what
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:20.520]  newsweek said and salon and raw story and all the usual folks that get their directives from
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:25.720]  media matters and george soros literally they said oh alex jones deep state behind los vegas
[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:33.400]  attack and they go yeah jones made it up and said isis was behind it and that al gore was behind it
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:37.720]  and that phil mud was behind it and i didn't say any of that i said al gore and phil mud said in the
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:41.880]  next two months we're going to start overthrowing trump and the left's been saying they got a big
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:51.000]  revolution coming in october but notice when they quote me they don't actually quote me till later
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.960]  and i said isn't it weird oj got released 20 hours before on a saturday sunday night so all the
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:09:00.280]  media would be there right on time filling up vegas trying to interview him i mean isn't that weird
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:09.240]  i didn't and then the media has headlines alex jones says oj did it talk about fake news headlines
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:15.400]  i didn't say that i just i didn't know weird coincidence that oj was there now i've talked
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:20.760]  to my army and navy shield contacts and others and they have all spent hours watching and listening
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:32.040]  to the videos and they say it sounds like multiple rifles firing semi auto or full auto at the same
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:38.840]  time and it's not just echoes they've analyzed the audio and it's very clear at some points
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:44.600]  you've got multiple shooters going on and and we're supposed to question they say they don't
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:49.160]  even know what happened and they've got all their own mainstream media conspiracy theories
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:10:05.720]  but when i start asking what's going on well i'm the worst person on earth here's a clip
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:09.560]  that is multiple farms
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:19.720]  and we've got witnesses to it i mean we've got hours of witnesses to it now let's go to some of
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:25.400]  those witnesses after clip after clip bullets flying everywhere everybody running was really
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:30.840]  really bad and you guys said that there were multiple shots fired we were on the furthest
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:37.160]  we were the furthest vip stages away from mandalay bay and they were ricocheting everywhere where we
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:42.600]  were so i it was they were firing from somewhere high and they were unloading clip after clip after
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:47.640]  clip after clip so there is a shooter you believe multiple shooters multiple shooters has to be
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:52.760]  how many people were hit did you have no idea i hopefully none but there was obviously people
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:58.600]  hit did you guys see any victims i mean as far as saw one drive by hanging out of the back of the
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:05.160]  truck r because he had probably a truck right now cpr wow there's bullets ricocheting like
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:09.000]  found down by the bottom of our feet because we all got on the floor crawling he's got a one more
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:17.240]  witness as well here's another clip dean was playing and we were in our booth and we thought it was
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:23.000]  fireworks and then it just didn't stop and i'm like debbie that's not fireworks and then people
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:28.920]  started running and we asked what was going on and they said it was a shooter and and then we
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:34.680]  realized it was it sounded like machine guns it sounded like more than one machine gun and it just
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:42.680]  didn't stop like 30 minutes what you guys do we were hiding in a beer truck behind our booth and in a
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:50.120]  Budweiser truck for about 30 minutes now i've got i've got two different key pieces of news here
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:55.240]  we just joined us the mainstream media is in concerted efforts being directed by chuckie
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:12:00.200]  schumer they've met that the news on late night shows you name it to demonize gun owners and
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:07.400]  collectively say it's all our fault that is sickening and that is evil number two you have
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:13.880]  the very conservative christian flyover folks being attacked that are being blamed by the media for
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:18.920]  doing it you've got a cbs vice president saying they deserved it and she's not sorry for them
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:24.120]  and i've got stacks of news of liberals and so-called movie stars out there saying that
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:28.200]  they got what they deserve and these are trump supporters i've got cnn saying these are mainly
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:33.880]  trump supporters and like oh look at the irony you deserve it i never blamed the gay folks uh at
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:38.920]  the pulse nightclub i said why are you supporting isis and bringing in all these unvetted muslims
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:43.240]  when they keep attacking you and and throwing you off buildings i wasn't saying it's your fault
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:49.240]  they killed you i was saying why are you supporting them but the media that accused me of that
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:57.000]  is literally doing it we'll play those clips coming up in the next segment but the big takeaway
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:03.240]  here is we're in a war an information war you've got the democrats calling for revolution at the
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:07.720]  shooting ranges training for mass murder working with islamists bringing them in saying they're
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:13.080]  preparing a big communist overthrow socialist overthrow that's coming in october and then
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:19.560]  you've got a group that would be targeted christian white mainly country music folks veterans being
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:23.800]  hit that's where you go to kill veterans you got a bunch of even kids getting killed it's just night
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:30.600]  marriage and you've got the media blaming the victims and you've got them ignoring the fact
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:35.640]  that isis took responsibility that they normally only do that when it's real when when they've
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:40.360]  actually done it you had all these other islamic attacks on sunday as well in canada and other
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:47.640]  areas like france and you've got his girlfriend his his his live in for many years his um i guess
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:52.840]  they call it common law marriage going to the middle east that's confirmed and we had a high level
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:58.840]  cia guy on yesterday kevin ship saying it looks like a false flag to go after conservatives and
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:02.680]  it's the same deal and to go after the second amendment that's the target the nra the american
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:11.640]  gun owner and the chairing on top of all this you've got the fact that if you pull back and
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:16.760]  look at this it's so incredibly obvious because the media doesn't want you to say islamic they
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:22.600]  don't want you to look there when all the evidence is pointing there and we have these incredible
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:27.080]  sources i mean i have sources right into the hostage rescue team i'm gonna stop right there
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:32.520]  not the hostage rescue team that did it but people that are in the regional teams who talked to the
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:39.080]  folks who reviewed the information within hours and they said that there was islamic paraphernalia
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:45.400]  and there was anti-facrap all over the place now i immediately said well that means they were
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:49.800]  either trying to set them up why would they do that or it was real but there's a blackout
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:55.320]  on that information we tweeted it at real alec shones a photo it looks real it's the same flooring
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:15:01.080]  we've seen in the videos we're a tourist shot at a year ago of him dead on the ground a viewer
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:05.240]  discretion is advised we're going to go out to break showing you that image was he brought up
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:10.520]  there and killed and then whoever was really there escaped we don't know we just know this is the
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:17.080]  season of globalist control we just know they're making their move on america and the deep states
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:22.120]  making their move and we predicted with precision and no amount of fake news can ignore that that
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:28.360]  they would trigger the new civil war with shootings at rock concerts or big venues or nfl events and
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:33.400]  now it's happening and they're blaming us the conservatives for it as we said they would do
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:43.960]  it's here we're right again thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry our ancestors
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:49.720]  would hear the drums of war giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:57.160]  defense sixty years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had drums

[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:33.800]  michael schneider is coming on we've got other very informative guests that are going to be joining
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:38.920]  us discuss all this i'm also going to try to open the phones up but i just want to hammer this home
[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:43.080]  everybody gets too complacent with trump in there we're in a total war for this country
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:48.360]  the globalists have overthrown countless other countries and they start civil wars and they
[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:55.000]  do it with mass shootings if you go back three years ago in ukraine there were mass shootings
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:01.000]  in town squares claiming the police had shot peaceful demonstrations that was covered for
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:05.320]  the elected government to be overthrown and paramilitary groups to attack the police
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:13.960]  who then stood down so they have a formulae and that's what we're looking at and they're cold
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:19.800]  blooded and it fits the season it fits the motive it fits the time it fits the target
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:27.080]  then he has the islamic connections everything and suddenly for the first time when ices takes
[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:31.240]  responsibility for something we're told it's not credible when every other time we were told it was
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:41.960]  credible so that's the big issue that we're looking at we have brian williams the king of fake news
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:47.000]  pushes gun control a guy that claimed he was shot down in a helicopter that's how stupid they think
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:53.400]  you are we have all these fbi agents running around saying we are going to legalize grenades next
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:22:01.160]  because they want to legalize suppressors that aren't silencers msnbc wants to start banning ammo
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:11.240]  and restricting it in high capacity mags this is their big event this is how they're coming
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:17.960]  after us and we've got jimmy kimmel bashes gun rights after los vegas massacre and we can show
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:27.240]  you the article on info wars dot com with jimmy kimmel with video and photos of his bodyguards
[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:36.600]  with their glock pistols and more tucked in at his offices and at his house that protect him
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:47.320]  but he says you can't have a gun that's how they operate that's what they think of you
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:57.320]  just like pierce morgan had the company armed response at his house a van that parked in front
[01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:05.000]  of his house with guys in the back of an air conditioned van with guns protecting him
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:15.560]  and with cameras on it and with a sign in his front yard saying armed response but he wants
[01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:22.840]  your guns and then there's this creature who i want to play first just a little bit of it
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:27.400]  because i can't watch much of it he calls the nr a terrorist keith oberman the same one that said
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:35.320]  russian scum we're at war with russia well now he's pointing at his real enemy the american
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:42.920]  gun owner so let's go ahead and hear from the failed sportscaster reading off a teleprompter
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:48.760]  one more time targeting his real enemy the american people i'm keith oberman and this is
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:55.800]  the resistance warmest condolences and sympathies will not suffice oh really pause we need leadership
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:24:02.200]  in this back it up a few seconds please oh but we've got the head of programming over at cbs saying
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:05.800]  she's glad they died or they deserve it you've got all these so-called movie stars saying they
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:09.640]  deserve it you got everybody on twitter and facebook saying it in mass and blaming them
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:18.040]  saying now maybe you'll grow up now maybe you'll turn your guns in oberman you're sick and you've
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:22.840]  got all these senators going up on the floor and saying it's not enough to just send sympathy we
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:27.800]  need to respond and ban guns really you never want to ban anything like when the islamists
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:34.840]  are coming in senator senator murphy let's continue with keith oberman
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:41.800]  warmest condolences and sympathies will not suffice we need leadership in this country
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:47.640]  which will prevent whatever their motive the terrorists in this country from buying guns
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:53.800]  in this country and killing crowds of people in this country instead the house of representatives
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:59.480]  is to vote this week to relax restrictions on buying silencers for firearms so it becomes
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:07.480]  more difficult to hear where the gunfire is coming from instead we have los vegas and for the website
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:16.360]  the gun violence archive we have the 272nd mass shooting it pause again and it took him 70 plus
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:21.160]  minutes to even find him and get in there and how to get all the guns in the hotel 40 plus guns
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:25.000]  and then his family said he wasn't even in the guns on and on and on can we get to the part where he
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:30.920]  calls the r.a. terrorist because i can't watch the whole thing i mean i can't subject myself to
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:40.120]  keith oberman like that the fake concern the fake swollenness of his face all the garbage he puts
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:46.040]  on that these people supported the arab spring that killed over a million people putting radical
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:50.760]  jihadis in charge killing all the christians and slaving women putting them into sex slavery
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:56.280]  selling little girls into sex slavery and it's a big joke to them now there it is keith oberman
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:00.600]  the generation be branded a terrorist organization i watched it this morning there's just that should
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:06.120]  have been clear there's a particular clip i want that's all coming up before i go any further ladies

[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:18.600]  sides because we're politically beating them and culturally they're losing the war on guns
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:23.400]  because people are going out and using guns and realizing that it's okay for them to protect
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:30.040]  themselves and the answer is more guns because actual gun crime is down since 1992 mass shootings

[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:54.600]  guns will be taken and no one will be able to be all we can take all the others for many of the
[01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:59.720]  police and guard troops it is an uncomfortable job to do this in america city's global governance
[01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:04.680]  at last is it one world the central bank is in charge aren't we all just living and dying
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:11.560]  of what the central banks do 1776 will commence again if you're proud to take our firearms do you
[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:23.000]  understand live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones robert ferrago is here with us in
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.800]  studio today we're really excited about that he is the founder and owner of the truth about guns
[01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:34.920]  dot com undoubtedly the number one non nr a dot com uh website uh out there so it's great to have
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:39.240]  you here with us my friend thank you sir we're actually uh three times bigger than the nr a site
[01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:43.000]  well i was just i mean i know they got a whole group of sites so i find biggest site in the big
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:47.080]  i mean i hope becomes the biggest site in the world period well after info wars no no i want
[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:51.080]  drudges to say huge no seriously because we don't win the second amendment fight in the first minute
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:55.560]  fight we lose it all they're coming after all of right now i i have to agree with you on that
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:35:02.280]  and so uh wow we've just seen this horrible tragic event take place you're a former cnn reporter
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:09.480]  and founder of the truth about guns in february 2010 to explore the ethics morality business
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:15.640]  politics culture technology practice strategy dangers in front of guns and of course it just
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:20.360]  goes into the fact that now it's probably the biggest gun site out there in 2015 the blog
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:26.840]  conducted a recreation of the paris charlie ebdo shooting to see if of the defensive gun
[01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:31.480]  use could have uh been effective so it's great to have you here thank you sir nice to be here
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:37.160]  so jump right on that microphone give us your first approximation 48 hours later after these
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:43.320]  tragic events uh in vegas biggest gun death uh event of civilians in u.s history instantly
[01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:48.040]  being seized on by the democrats instantly being used to say that nr a and gun owners
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:53.080]  are terrorists will play that clip of oberman here in just a minute i mean they are it's clear
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:57.960]  they're running their full assault now well they're just waiting for any excuse to do it i'm sure
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:04.600]  senator christ murphy has a drawer full of bills to restrict gun rights to americans so uh they'll
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:09.880]  dance in the blood of innocence no matter what whether it's a small group a large group a single
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:15.000]  person uh they're always exploiting death and tragedy to try and take away our gun rights
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.880]  what i like about your side is you just get into the real culture of the numbers the history of the
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:25.400]  facts is it safe to say the second amendment culture was winning and uh but people got a
[01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:29.960]  little bit complacent in the last nine months or so and now we're seeing the major leftist
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:36.840]  counter strike absolutely um with the election of trump a lot of people thought oh you know
[01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:41.960]  finally we can let our guard down and everything's going to be fine and in fact we're moving towards
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:47.000]  deregulating silencers and perhaps national reciprocity which would be a huge win for
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:53.400]  gun culture in america and uh then this happens and obviously people are shocked and and so they
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:37:00.040]  should be uh it is a terrible horrific event uh but once again uh it has nothing to do with
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:05.560]  legal gun owners with uh saying legal rational american gun owners who have the right to keep
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:12.600]  and bear arms which by the way doesn't depend on uh events it doesn't depend on democracy it's our
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:17.640]  natural civil and constitutionally protected rights so no matter what some nutcase does that
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:23.480]  doesn't affect my rights or at least it shouldn't and once again we're back in the trenches fighting
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:30.520]  for our gun rights uh it's how it's always going to be because obviously people who want to impose
[01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:35.720]  a progressive agenda on america which is basically large government status uh want to take away our
[01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:40.200]  guns they want to take away our gun rights because if we're disarmed we're easily manipulated
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:45.400]  mexico has a basic gun ban for the citizens one of the strictest in the world they have
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:49.480]  one of the highest crime rates if not the highest crime rate because only the bad guys in government
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:53.720]  have guns chicago has a gun ban basically they have the highest crime rate in the united states
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:59.880]  maybe the world for a city uh so i mean the facts are in gun culture has driven down crime
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:05.560]  what close to 60 percent since 1992 well you're making a practical argument and once again you
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:10.040]  don't have to make that argument each of us has an individual right to keep and bear arms
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:14.520]  regardless yeah why do i lose my freedoms because the nut job goes up there but how can you get
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:19.320]  40 guns in the hotel to begin with when everybody knows he was there five days the hotel maids dig
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:23.880]  through everything i think the total was 23 at the end of the day he had up in the up in the
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:28.360]  hotel now they're saying 40 so who knows well he put a lot of guns up there by the way it is
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:32.840]  important to know that the mandalay bay hotel is a gun-free zone you're not allowed to bring guns
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:38.600]  into that hotel so he broke that law and by the way he broke the law against murder so people who
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:43.800]  are willing to commit mass murder willing to commit crimes with guns with with bombs with uh
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:49.640]  other method methods cars they're not going to be stopped by laws obviously and we're on over 200
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:53.240]  plus stations so there's a lot of new listeners tuning in but i think talk radio understands
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:39:00.360]  those facts you lay it all out at the truth about guns dot com but they're coming they're confident
[01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:05.720]  they think that they're getting our firearms uh and notice the left was calling for all this
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:10.760]  violence calling for an uprising in october and they keep saying they don't have a motive he attacked
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:16.200]  the country music venue i mean i think the motive right there is clear this was a white guy attacking
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:20.920]  a hip hop concert they'd say he didn't like black people he was a white supremacist i mean right
[01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:25.080]  there you've got massive motive well there are a lot of theories about what what his motives are
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:29.880]  we certainly know that he had enormous gambling debts uh he may have been mad at the facility
[01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:36.920]  and wanted to make them pay right he had taken uh he had made 16 bets over $10,000 in the last
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:42.200]  two weeks which came out earlier so he may have been a scorned gambler well as you know gambling
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:47.320]  is an addiction and if you remove what the addict wants that that makes them kind of crazy there
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:52.200]  are only two ways to look at that maybe he uh thought i'll go out and blow all my money because
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:57.720]  then i'm going to go shoot everybody and die or he was motivated by that he was angry at the casino
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:01.960]  you know they didn't give me i've spent millions of dollars i think that's one of the only theories
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:07.160]  other than islamist's leftist antifa that makes sense because well look a hundred thousand dollars
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:13.000]  of philippines that's islamic they've just had islamic takeovers of major towns and cities
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.880]  uh you've i mean i've gotten listen i have sources in the hostage rescue team and they say
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:22.600]  that a he fought back and they killed him and that b there was antifa and islamist's literature
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:27.320]  everywhere i was told that at you are in the morning later it came out she'd been to the middle
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:31.080]  east i mean so i was told stuff before it was in the news well i hadn't heard that i haven't heard
[01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:37.960]  that information uh that's pretty uh distressing information uh there it is uh that's just part
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:42.360]  of it guys we print him the kit daniels article the article he wants the first one length there
[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:48.200]  right uh where i mean and then well apparently uh his girlfriend had some connection with family
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:52.200]  in the philippine so that may have explained a hundred thousand as well yeah but um oh i'm not
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:56.920]  saying it's open and shut all i know is first isis takes responsibility generally they're
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:41:01.000]  accurate when they do it ap said that then later oh they're just doing it because they're desperate
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:09.080]  and then later they said alex jones made it up uh they never made the claim well alex it's early
[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:15.320]  days we don't know exactly what motivated this this nutcase uh we do know that the progressives
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:21.240]  are using this to attack our gun rights regardless uh we don't know for it's kind of funny how it's
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:25.880]  taken so long to figure out whether he was a democrat or republican i think uh in other
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:31.720]  situations it's been pretty fast uh or whether he indeed he was an nra member the thing is we
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:36.680]  shouldn't rush to judgment on this but we are alone in that because the other side of the equation
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:42.200]  has certainly rushed to judgment and exactly so what do we do well we do what we've always done
[01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:48.360]  we fight we fight for our rights politically we fight for our rights in the culture and remember
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:54.520]  gun culture is winning we are ahead of the game at the moment we are so you know we just got to keep
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:58.760]  keep going uh it means and then this happens though i mean right when the left's calling for
[01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:03.720]  the revolution and then a country music venue gets blasted we have to look at the prime suspect
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:07.960]  being an islamist sister and antifa i mean i'm sorry well you can look at that alex but until we
[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:13.880]  see proof i'm not prepared to reach that conclusion i mean look all things are possible i don't
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:19.000]  obviously isis is a is a deeply evil organization and uses people and sometimes by the way i agree
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:23.400]  with you but hillary clinton yesterday morning said it was gun owners fault now they're saying
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:28.680]  we're all collectively to blame show i blame hillary i say she did it i say she paid him i
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:32.760]  don't i don't agree with that but hypothetically for the case of argument if she's gonna do that
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:39.480]  then no hillary you did it you finance the whole thing that's one theory vitamin mineral fusion

[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:28.440]  robert ferrago is our guest the truth about guns.com and i didn't know he was in austinite
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:33.720]  because i'm on his site every week we linked his his huge website all the time and then i saw him
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:41.080]  at a gun range this weekend and he's lost so much weight something i wish i'd do again i was like
[01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:45.720]  yeah he was like yeah i own truth about guns i was like yeah you look like the guy but you're
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:51.320]  a lot smaller now so congratulations on that thank you i'm half the man i used to be well i mean i'm
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:54.680]  still about a third of the man i was but then i've kind of crept back because i've gotten so lazy
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:58.360]  with all the supplements i take they help me lose weight but then actually when i stop working out
[01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:01.800]  still it doesn't work so okay well you should try some of the supplements you sell some of them are
[01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:08.840]  very effective i'm sure well they are actually uh people are deficient in things like iodine was
[01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:13.000]  the biggest thing i mean just with that the workouts i was doing like four or five years ago i lost
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:17.960]  for the 30 pounds doing the same workouts just because i was iodine deficient and then the other
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:22.680]  things and then the problem is i just got to wear again the last year well i have a new baby and stuff
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:27.160]  oh congratulations thank you i just i just quit working out but i've been doing it again at least
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:31.160]  twice a week i used to work out four or five days a week so i'm doing it good well i'm glad you're
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:35.960]  back on the wagon there enough about me you're gonna ride shotgun on the summit of the next hour
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:40.440]  with some other guests we've got joining us but truth about guns you're looking at this what is
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:47.240]  your gut tell you as a former you know cnn you know news man the whole nine yards what was your
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:52.440]  process of deciding to kind of get out of that system of course cnn was a lot better 10 years ago
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:57.720]  and then actually get into the opposition well cnn wasn't that much better 10 years ago in my
[01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:02.440]  opinion it was i mean it was bad but man they'll lie now like constant well you're behind the scenes
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:08.200]  tell me how i'm wrong i believe you well it's true uh there's a cultural mindset there that's
[01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:13.400]  political they they all come from the same background the same schools the same uh urban
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:18.040]  environments echo chamber yeah none of them know how to shoot a gun for example there are very few
[01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:23.640]  people who know anything about firearms there uh and they're just disconnected from from the
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:29.400]  reality that you and i are aware of the conservative uh mindset is just not there there's nobody
[01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:35.880]  there representing it so people make decisions uh which are you you and i would say whoa hold on
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:41.720]  a second that's that's uh not fair uh but they nobody's there to tell them that it isn't and they
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:48.280]  just all have that cultural bias towards the progressive uh or liberal mindset is that shit i
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:52.520]  mean at at the top there are elites with bodyguards and they want to disarm the public because they
[01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:57.400]  want control and that's in their own wiki leaks and documents but down low if you take out leftist
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:03.000]  like i went out a few times with uh a hollywood producer who's a patriot lives here in austin
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:07.400]  mike judge and he took the whole or most the cast of silicon valley out right when its first
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:11.320]  season was starting about four years ago before it had even aired and there was like 30 people at
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:16.600]  his house outside austin's ranch we had them scared of guns saying we were wrong hey right over a
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:22.440]  barbecue why do you have guns to women shooting bullseye at 200 yards flipping out wanting one
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:28.120]  and everybody having a great time and converting that i'm not bad why can't i have one so so it's
[01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:32.920]  all about rugged individualism it's about skinning a buck running a trot line but the liberals they
[01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:37.800]  live in these high-rise buildings they they don't know how to change a tire they are domesticated
[01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:43.080]  and i think that's really the process of guns is bringing people back out of that back into
[01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:48.040]  being a real person absolutely i mean guns are fun for one thing and that's something people should
[01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:52.360]  understand and recognize uh and they don't pick themselves up and shoot people that's one of the
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:57.640]  things that a lot of people have never touched a gun don't understand is that that thing over there
[01:50:57.640 --> 01:51:03.320]  is not dangerous it's the person who is holding it or not hopefully in that case but yes the best
[01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:08.040]  way to convert people to uh the cause of of the second amendment is to take them out and show
[01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:13.240]  them what guns can and cannot do because they have never touched one they have never shot one they
[01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:18.600]  don't understand what it can and cannot do so they they they buy all the propaganda that it's
[01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:25.880]  evil and that it's uh the people who uh have these impulses uh right that are that are uh the
[01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:30.200]  the average person is a good person but give them a gun and they have a anger attack they're
[01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:35.400]  going to shoot someone which is completely false almost every case they're on serotonin
[01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:41.080]  red reuptake inhibitors and even the insert says this can make you go megalomaniac and kill people
[01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:48.280]  well there are a lot of reasons why people flip out but most people don't uh americans are law-abiding
[01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:54.120]  peaceful people and we have these guns because we have the right to protect ourselves in a peaceful
[01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:59.560]  manner we have the right to keep and bear arms how we use those guns is subject to laws and
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:03.960]  regulations we can't brandish them and threaten people with them we can't use them to shoot
[01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:09.640]  people who are not posing an imminent credible threat of death or grievous bodily harm we are a
[01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:15.640]  civilized people and when somebody does something uncivilized like the las vegas shooter it doesn't
[01:52:15.640 --> 01:52:21.240]  reflect on us as law-abiding gun owners at least it shouldn't exactly but they're trying to say
[01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:25.320]  he's over let's play that clip in a moment he's over but in our age should be branded a terrorist
[01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:30.440]  organization he's saying gun owners are terrorists he's saying we're guilty well back in world war
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:36.360]  two of the nazis were in poland and somebody shot an ss officer they'd kill the whole street
[01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:41.480]  or in the soviet union if somebody killed a member of the gru they'd kill maybe half the town
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:46.520]  that was a small town or sent them to reeducation camps or gulags this idea that because somebody
[01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:51.240]  else did something i'm at fault meanwhile being killed in a mass shooting is one of the rarest
[01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:56.280]  forms of death but it creates the perception just like great white shark attack is like six seven
[01:52:56.280 --> 01:53:00.680]  people a year die from it people still are scared that great whites are going to eat them alex you
[01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:05.240]  make a really good point and that is that we're not seeing the big picture when we look at guns
[01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:09.880]  a lot of people say well you know society would be better off if we had this gun control law that
[01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:15.000]  gun control law which is patently untrue but they make that argument that it's for social utility
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:22.360]  to make society better i'm the son of a holocaust survivor i understand what government can do
[01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:27.800]  government is the greatest threat to personal liberty to our very lives we have the second
[01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:32.760]  amendment not to protect ourselves from criminals or to go hunting we have it to protect ourselves
[01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:37.640]  from the government i don't trust any government and i don't trust the united states government
[01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:44.360]  our firearms protect us from our own government and people have to understand and embrace that fact
[01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:49.880]  it's not about protecting yourself from criminals because the greatest criminals in history have
[01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:55.960]  always been government and we're not having the mass slaughter i mean okay so you had 500 people
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:54:02.360]  shot that's horrible terrible but look how many people are murdered in mexico right next door
[01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:08.360]  tens of it's 120 000 we know of in the last decade look at the slaughter that goes on in
[01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:14.440]  countries uh in africa or a millions world look at the genocides we've had throughout history look
[01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:18.280]  at them look at the latest islamic waves in the middle east killing over a million people
[01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:24.840]  well and uh and and slaughtering christians unarmed disarmed people we cannot allow ourselves
[01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:30.440]  to be disarmed because if we are we will be at the mercy of the greatest threat to our liberty
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:36.040]  which is not some nutcase at the top of a hotel in the 32nd floor it's the government itself
[01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:40.840]  that's right and so the second moment it's about a balance of power and yes it's messy sometimes
[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:45.240]  and it's sad and believe me i've got children uh the i mean the point is i still let them get in
[01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:50.600]  the car even though more die every day in cars in the u.s than died by the mass shooting the truth is
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:55.560]  more guns mean less crime all the statistics are there and the left is losing that battle so that's
[01:54:55.560 --> 01:54:59.960]  why they're panicking but that's powerful testimony i mean look at nazi germany first thing they did
[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:05.640]  was take the general public's gun soviet system any authoritarian system the un says in their world
[01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:10.680]  treaty on guns they want us to pass and ratify that civilian ownership of firearms threatens
[01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:16.360]  the legitimate power monopoly of the state they're saying a power monopoly of the state is legitimate
[01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:23.080]  no it's called tyranny i i couldn't agree more my family history uh is testimony to that i i grew
[01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:29.080]  up with a japanese american whose parents were uh interned during world war two uh these things
[01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:33.800]  happened and by the way i just want to point something out this is not the worst mass shooting
[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:39.720]  in u.s history the worst mass shooting in u.s history was a wounded knee we're 150 you know what
[01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:45.880]  you're right we got to get an article out on that that was 150 right 150 to 300 native americans were
[01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:50.360]  slaughtered by government troops and you know what those government troops were there to do disarm them
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:54.520]  disarm the Lakota man we got to get you on all the time i know you're a busy guy doing like
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:58.920]  other bunch of interviews already cbs you name it but man it's great i didn't even know you were in
[01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:02.040]  austin people always see me and go i didn't know you were in austin alex i've got to like look at
[01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:05.400]  all these people i love watching and listening to that they're in austin let's put on screen the
[01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:09.720]  truth about guns dot com because that's my next subject when we come back in just a minute with
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:14.840]  you i want to ask you again the owner or founder of uh uh the truth about guns dot com robert forago
[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:20.680]  what about the first amendment the left now says they want a ministry of truth the shutdown
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:24.360]  conservative libertarians they claim we're all funded by russians which is like saying we're
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:29.240]  funded by chinese easter bunnies from the moon uh and they say they want to shut us down because
[01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:34.920]  they can't win the debate but that's true biggest gun massacre in u.s history's wounded knee we got
[01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:40.120]  to get that out right now wow it's important for people to realize where the real danger lies
[01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:44.360]  you know i used to think second amendment was key because it depends on all the others but isn't
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:49.560]  the first it just as important and the fact that they admit they want to go after that and say we
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:56.280]  don't deserve that speech and they want to take away the president's twitter well uh you know
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:01.960]  there are people who do not like the idea of uh individuals having liberty they just don't like
[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:06.680]  it and they're willing to do whatever it takes to by the way make a progressive case we're glad
[01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:09.640]  everybody gets to learn the second amendment hopefully they love freedom in this country but
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:15.560]  was there not four truckloads of women in the jibs at the shooting range when i met you uh uh
[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:20.360]  sunday there were i think there are about five of them there uh no but there was four loads we
[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:24.280]  learned oh we're there yeah i i talked to the staff well i'm glad if they're americans i hope
[01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:28.600]  they're exercising but i mean just weather with the jibs like i like i'm keeping my gun as most of
[01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:34.680]  you already know i am a voracious consumer of news and information and in the last four or five years
[01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:40.280]  doing more and more research i came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware
[01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:45.800]  of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do today
[01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:51.640]  and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting killing and
[01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:58.120]  then processing and so i set out to develop caveman but to not just have concentrated bone broth from

[02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:11.000]  dot com i'm alex jones your host he's gonna call us a little bit more into the hour michael
[02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:17.640]  schneider joins us uh we also have laura lumar joining us she's done a lot of research about
[02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:23.800]  islamic connections to this guy more i mean we know that they've swept the isis taking credit
[02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:28.920]  under the rug and they just said i made that up that's fake news okay when they say that but we
[02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:33.320]  don't know what happened and listen i'm glad to see muslims that want to live free come to america
[02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:39.000]  i've said that but at the same time uh when you see europe eighty percent military age men being
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:45.000]  brought in this whole four steel the non-vetting uh and we've just seen the left obama and hillary
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:50.440]  and others back to europe spring that's when i get concerned well one can be concerned but i
[02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:55.720]  wasn't concerned by seeing the uh muslim ladies mostly ladies shooting at the range of all americans
[02:00:55.720 --> 02:01:00.760]  have a right to keep and bear arms so i'm just saying it was surreal and then i told and i was
[02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:04.680]  respectful so i didn't videotape it but then we found out from people there no there'd been two
[02:01:04.680 --> 02:01:10.120]  loads before i saw that one load and you know getting the whole range and then another load
[02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:17.400]  four loads one guy training uh like 15 16 women and all having a great time all being completely
[02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:22.280]  respectful to the range they were very nice ladies and uh i'm glad to see the more americans who
[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:26.760]  keep and bear arms to say for our rights aren't doesn't matter whether they're white black muslim
[02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:32.760]  jewish uh quaker i totally agree with you i'm just saying in many of those countries
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:38.680]  women aren't allowed to shoot guns well that's why america is great isn't it exactly so why do you
[02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:46.040]  think the feminists are endorsing radical islam uh because they're progressive statists who don't
[02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:50.840]  believe in personal liberty and exactly so they team up they like the authoritarianism
[02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:55.400]  of radical islam yeah absolutely well i mean they're all of all of the same you go far enough
[02:01:56.120 --> 02:02:01.480]  in that direction you have all these people who are want to do something the core belief
[02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:06.280]  is that they know better than you do what's for you and they're elitists and that's not
[02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:09.880]  how america should be and that's not the kind of people we want to have in charge
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:15.480]  but there are loads of them and i think you know alex i gotta give you credit your website your
[02:02:15.480 --> 02:02:21.640]  program other our website which is a uh i don't know seven years old we've now been able to get
[02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:26.760]  our messages out to people who couldn't get them before remember i was on the inside at cnn
[02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:33.000]  i understand how the gatekeepers have destroyed uh used to control the information so that people
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:40.280]  couldn't uh get the truth so i'm i'm delighted that uh we have now a way to counter the well let me
[02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:44.280]  congratulate you the audience everybody we just want free choice doesn't mean we have all the
[02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:47.720]  answers we're not up here saying we know exactly what happened we're just simply looking at every
[02:02:47.720 --> 02:02:53.400]  angle so then fake news corporate news misrepresent what we say what we do but people seen that trick
[02:02:53.400 --> 02:02:57.640]  so many times it doesn't work anymore i think people are becoming more cynical and and so they
[02:02:57.640 --> 02:03:03.880]  should be uh because there is a lot of misinformation being spread but it's more than that though i
[02:03:03.880 --> 02:03:08.040]  think what's happened recently which really bothers me is that there's a lot of hatred
[02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:14.040]  coming from the left a lot of unmitigated hatred discussed they're getting radicalized i think
[02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:18.440]  that's true i was listening to msnbc i listened to all the different channels to try and get the
[02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:25.000]  perspective and just the constant bashing of uh of donald trump who deserves some bashing but
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:30.760]  they just they try and tear him to frothing they are frothing at the mouth and when they
[02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:35.080]  talk about guns it is obviously something that they're going to rally around because
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:41.480]  you can't have old fat white guys who are redneck extremist uh racists having guns
[02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:45.320]  and uh they're absolutely wrong about characterizing us as having guns but they
[02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:50.600]  they do know who their enemy is really and their enemy are people who embrace individual liberty
[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:56.280]  and nobody they're collectivist they're domesticators they really want domesticated helpless people
[02:03:56.280 --> 02:03:59.640]  well they do because they're easier to manipulate that's for our own good though you have to
[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:04.360]  understand that alex it's it's not because they uh want to uh get pleasure out of this they're
[02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:10.040]  doing this to to lift people up and to make the left wants domesticated defenseless slaves
[02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:15.320]  the truth about guns dot com that's the name of the last 30 minutes we put this on facebook and
[02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:21.240]  youtube the left wants defenseless domesticated slaves exclamation point the truth about guns

[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:42.840]  here police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool
[02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:50.040]  called stingrays which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages without
[02:04:50.040 --> 02:04:57.240]  warrants the technology comes courtesy of the fbi who have forced our nation's police departments
[02:04:57.240 --> 02:05:03.720]  into signing nondisclosure agreements forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology
[02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:09.720]  needless to say this is a direct violation of our fourth amendment and they have no legal authority
[02:05:09.720 --> 02:05:15.160]  for warrantless stingray spying where we now know that police are collecting information
[02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:21.960]  on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes once again more evidence
[02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:27.960]  that the police state isn't coming it's already here this is dara mcbreen and i invite you to
[02:05:27.960 --> 02:05:43.880]  join the resistance info wars dot com
[02:05:43.880 --> 02:05:53.800]  um
[02:05:53.800 --> 02:06:13.720]  it's alex jones live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide from the info wars dot com studios
[02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:23.400]  in the uk for the seventh year in a row they've introduced legislation in parliament
[02:06:23.400 --> 02:06:29.400]  to make you get a license for a butcher knife and of course the jihadis you have acid attacks
[02:06:29.400 --> 02:06:38.200]  almost every day when somebody runs over somebody with a car they are not blaming the car and saying
[02:06:38.200 --> 02:06:43.400]  other people driving cars are being insensitive but they are saying people that are shooting guns
[02:06:43.400 --> 02:06:47.640]  now and putting videos out are insensitive in fact i'd ask them before he left uh to go to
[02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:53.400]  port urico and cover that and also cover some some gun stuff uh in georgia did did did he give you
[02:06:53.400 --> 02:06:59.080]  guys videos in the folder i forgot to ask or call them before they're playing texas right now
[02:06:59.080 --> 02:07:02.200]  because i want to be able to show myself uh shooting the other day and point out this is
[02:07:02.200 --> 02:07:06.920]  not insensitive uh when i'm doing that uh robert farago is our guest the owner and founder of
[02:07:06.920 --> 02:07:12.520]  the frith about guns dot com a former cnn uh you know uh i guess producer and camera operator and
[02:07:12.520 --> 02:07:18.440]  more decided to leave and now has the biggest gun site in the world california assembly speaker
[02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:25.320]  anthony rendon gun lobbyist and pro gun politicians were in the room with los vegas spree killer
[02:07:25.320 --> 02:07:30.520]  what is that well he uh he says they're equally culpable that uh they were you know metaphorically
[02:07:30.520 --> 02:07:36.920]  in the same room with the killer uh in los vegas so they are equally responsible which is just
[02:07:36.920 --> 02:07:42.200]  ridiculous it's a ridiculous smear against uh people who are fighting for americans gun rights
[02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:46.680]  we have this clip i haven't gotten to yet this is keith oberman saying the nr a should be branded
[02:07:46.680 --> 02:07:51.480]  as a terrorist organization i mean he's saying gun owners are terrorist well if you're a terrorist
[02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:57.000]  then you can have your guns taken away right so it's uh it's what you do you marginalize and then
[02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:02.600]  you criminalize the behavior and then that's what rome manuel famously said is he said you can't let
[02:08:02.600 --> 02:08:07.000]  it you know good crisis go to waste and he said if you're a gun owner we'll just put you on a no
[02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:11.480]  fly list and then take your guns right if you're if the fbi decides you're a terrorist then you
[02:08:11.480 --> 02:08:16.440]  don't they can come get your guns under the laws that were proposed by the democrats and uh our
[02:08:16.440 --> 02:08:21.240]  president by the way supported and then changed his mind about that all right let's go ahead and
[02:08:21.240 --> 02:08:26.600]  roll this clip of keith oberman here it is it's disgusting and why a group that enables such
[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:32.840]  massacres the national rifle association is not branded for what it is a terrorist organization
[02:08:33.640 --> 02:08:37.960]  the gun lobby's interpretation of the second amendment wrote richard nixon's conservative
[02:08:37.960 --> 02:08:43.400]  chief justice of the united states warren berger is one of the greatest pieces of fraud i repeat the
[02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:48.840]  word fraud on the american people by special interest groups that i have ever seen in my lifetime
[02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:54.280]  the real purpose of the second amendment was to ensure that state armies the militia would be
[02:08:54.280 --> 02:09:00.360]  maintained for the defense of the state the very language of the second amendment refutes any argument
[02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:06.600]  that it was intended to guarantee every citizen an unfettered right to any kind of weapon he or
[02:09:06.600 --> 02:09:14.680]  she desires the second amendment doesn't guarantee the right to have firearms at all there are seven
[02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:20.520]  thousand eight hundred and twenty words in our constitution amendments included the words right
[02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:28.280]  and rights appear only fifteen times vote votes and voting appear only thirty seven times that's
[02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:32.840]  enough of this pontificating i mean jimmy kimmel's been caught on video with armed bodyguards at his
[02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:38.680]  house at his business but he also says all gun owners are to blame what do you say to this well
[02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:43.000]  first of all that that quote about the second amendment that it doesn't cover the individual
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:49.000]  right to keep and bear arms is is crazy i mean it's it's it's reinterpreting history just because
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:54.120]  one chief justice of the supreme court decided that the americans don't have an individual
[02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:58.920]  right to keep and bear arms doesn't mean it's true we do have that right we have an individual right
[02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:05.640]  and and keith oberman is reinterpreting the second amendment and it's the ultimate classism that rich
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:10.440]  people and elites can have guys with full auto protecting them and helicopters and then you
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:15.880]  know five thousand acre compounds but then we can't have guns protect ourselves it's bs well it's
[02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:21.400]  worse than bs it's dangerous in fact he's not just calling he said ban the in all right yes that's
[02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:25.640]  right well if you have the nr a as a terrorist organization then you can take their guns and
[02:10:25.640 --> 02:10:31.000]  anybody who's a member can have their firearms absolutely so it's a confiscation play and
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:35.480]  it's pretty thinly veiled but it's not unexpected and it's not the first time i've we've heard this
[02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:39.800]  before robert froggos with guns dot com joining us you're gonna hear another 15 minutes and you're
[02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:43.320]  going to go do another big shoot he'll be riding a chuggalist for the rest of the hour is michael
[02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:49.080]  snider uh he of course is an educator a best-selling author uh he runs websites getting over a million
[02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:54.440]  views uh every week the economic collapse blog dot com michael snider for congress dot com i
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:58.360]  guess running there in idaho i hope he wins he's he's getting some good poll numbers uh
[02:10:58.360 --> 02:11:03.960]  frequent contributor to info wars michael snider great to have you here with us in illustrious
[02:11:03.960 --> 02:11:08.680]  company but with but with a really saddening thing that's happening what's your first approximation
[02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:12.840]  of what we've witnessed we knew the left had their big revolution coming in october they said we're
[02:11:12.840 --> 02:11:18.600]  going to start killing you this guy with connections to islamists in the left uh you know is here
[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:23.400]  doing this maybe he was mad casino over debts or maybe he was an islamist but we have the most
[02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:27.640]  evidence pointing towards islamists but the media is really running from that what do you
[02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:33.480]  think's going on michael yeah well alex what happened in las vegas was a terrible tragedy and
[02:11:33.480 --> 02:11:37.480]  the media is using this to go out to the second amendment when i believe it was an attack on
[02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:41.400]  trump supporters now this guy they're they're trying to say oh he doesn't have a political
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:47.960]  background best evidence is the target a country music venue exactly and if he had been a trump
[02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:52.360]  supporter it's like an attack on a synagogue you say it was probably a muslim or a nazi i mean i'm
[02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:56.920]  not saying that's what happened but you've got isis taken responsibility and it's an attack on christian
[02:11:56.920 --> 02:12:02.440]  conservative veteran military types i mean it's just it's just reeks of that i mean i'm sorry go ahead
[02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:07.800]  oh yeah alex and somebody had remembered that they had spotted this guy
[02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:13.400]  at an antitrump protest in reno back in august so people started hunting for this video and they
[02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:17.960]  found it in fact we found three different videos if people want to check them out show those
[02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:22.920]  economic clubs yeah and and so we don't know 100 percent if it's this this guy but we've got him
[02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:28.440]  from a whole bunch of different angles it appears to be him a guy in a pink nasa shirt with a pink
[02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:35.160]  hat and so if he was at that antitrump rally in august and reno that explains a lot because apparently
[02:12:35.160 --> 02:12:40.120]  you know this was obviously set up way ahead of time because you had to pick this target in advance
[02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:44.520]  this country music festival and even the mainstream media is admitting why would you target a country
[02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:49.000]  music festival while lots of trump supporters are going to be there conservatives are going to be there
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:54.920]  so it'd be the kind of target you would pick if you want to attack trump supporters and obviously
[02:12:54.920 --> 02:12:59.720]  you checked into his hotel room way ahead of time he had all kinds of guns this was an extremely
[02:12:59.720 --> 02:13:04.760]  well planned i know this at any hotel i meant and everybody knows this they dig through everything
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:08.760]  they do a security suite the first time the maids go in you put it up a stir bomb they always come
[02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:16.120]  in he was there five days with 42 guns reportedly and they didn't know man something stinks well it
[02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:22.360]  was uh 23 but that's still a lot of guns a bc is reporting 42 now you may be right 42 guns that's
[02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:26.200]  well remember you can only shoot one at a time so uh it's kind of weird that he would take that you
[02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:32.280]  only really need like what three well i don't need any uh to do that kind of well no kidding but i'm
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:39.640]  just saying yeah i yeah is that him with a nasa shirt we don't know uh it's it's early days um we
[02:13:39.640 --> 02:13:44.440]  don't know his political affiliations it would certainly help to know that but uh the most like
[02:13:44.440 --> 02:13:51.960]  him i'm sorry wow i hadn't seen the other this video wow i saw the other ones and he reportedly
[02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:58.520]  used to live in florida and so he had a little nasa shirt yeah he had uh an ex-wife in california
[02:13:58.520 --> 02:14:03.000]  as well he may have purchased some firearms in california that was reported uh which which is
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:07.400]  really bad news for california and this is in where is this in where was this was it i
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:13.640]  know this was in nevada but where michael the it was in rino nevada rino nevada in august so
[02:14:13.640 --> 02:14:17.960]  this is fairly recent and you know this is disturbing because we're seeing these guys snap
[02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:21.880]  like at the baseball field in virginia well yeah that guy said i'm going out to kill republicans
[02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:28.920]  and the media celebrated it they said hashtag hunt republicans oh that looks i'm sorry that last video
[02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:34.280]  looks like him i'm sorry bone structure the way he smiles he looks like an idiot i'm not saying
[02:14:34.280 --> 02:14:40.040]  that's the guy but let's go back to that last video holy tolito that i'm telling that looks
[02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:46.440]  like his eyes his smile well we can we can certainly find that out that information should be available
[02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:50.520]  as to whether he went there or not so i'm and i'm sure that the uh well you know the police said
[02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:56.040]  he was known by them right and there he was just talking to the cops yeah it's it's hard to know
[02:14:56.040 --> 02:15:00.920]  exactly what they knew but we should find out we should also if that isn't him that's his brother
[02:15:00.920 --> 02:15:06.280]  that's his twin brother whoa oh my i'm sorry i'm freaking out right now sorry go ahead well i'm just
[02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:11.080]  saying we need more information about this uh this killer we need to know uh about his gambling
[02:15:11.080 --> 02:15:18.120]  debts we know he did uh 16 transactions over 10 000 in the last two weeks as well so he had a huge
[02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:23.160]  and i don't think he won somehow i don't think that was all and that would be his lamasus that would
[02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:29.640]  fund him or some leftist foundation cutout group for him to carry this out that's one theory well
[02:15:29.640 --> 02:15:33.960]  the lefts been saying they're gonna start killing all the conservatives come october first it was
[02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:39.320]  october first not a group you develop living defense for us it took you over a year to do it
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:44.680]  why is this so good because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares
[02:15:44.680 --> 02:15:50.440]  me the most i mean i try to make sure that i don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:57.080]  my system but right now we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything that's harmful to your

[02:20:20.760 --> 02:20:25.320]  michael schneider is our guest robert karago also truth about guns dot com
[02:20:26.200 --> 02:20:32.280]  he is our guest here in studio let me ask michael schneider and of course you this as well where
[02:20:32.280 --> 02:20:37.400]  do you see this going because they're in full war mode blaming all gun owners blaming the nra
[02:20:37.400 --> 02:20:42.200]  ban everything foaming at the mouth there's usually copycat shootings once these things
[02:20:42.200 --> 02:20:46.440]  start up i mean the whole season i'm sure you've seen the left calling for revolution everywhere
[02:20:46.440 --> 02:20:50.440]  and you know public officials saying they're gonna kill trump i mean it's just it's an incredible
[02:20:50.440 --> 02:20:56.120]  atmosphere i haven't seen it this bad since the 60s when we had a real split between democrat and
[02:20:56.120 --> 02:21:02.360]  republican hippie and straight martini drinker and marijuana person the country is divided
[02:21:03.160 --> 02:21:08.840]  on on strange on the basis of small government big government really and and we're not getting
[02:21:08.840 --> 02:21:13.000]  any better we're not getting any closer one side has to win and i'm not talking about a shooting
[02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:18.360]  war i'm talking about a voting war and a culture war but this can't stand the center will not hold
[02:21:18.360 --> 02:21:22.600]  we have people on one hand who value individual liberty we have people on the other hand who
[02:21:22.600 --> 02:21:29.080]  want to take control of our lives somebody has to win this and i you know i pray and work every day
[02:21:29.080 --> 02:21:33.720]  so that the people have individual liberty do but as far as the gun situation is concerned
[02:21:33.720 --> 02:21:40.040]  the gun control activists in states like california have control new jersey hawaii uh
[02:21:40.040 --> 02:21:46.600]  maryland uh you know those states are pretty much lost to us and it's it's a it's a terrible thing
[02:21:46.600 --> 02:21:51.880]  really our only hope at this point is a slow cultural movement ahead because remember there are
[02:21:51.880 --> 02:21:57.000]  a lot of gun owners in california and the supreme court of the united states has to hear a gun case
[02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:01.480]  which restores our rights the whole idea of may issue you know that the government can decide
[02:22:01.480 --> 02:22:07.800]  whether you may or may not have a firearm has to be struck down and until it is we are all in
[02:22:07.800 --> 02:22:13.240]  danger not just california the rest of the country as well it's a it's a it's a war it's an info war
[02:22:13.240 --> 02:22:20.520]  it is what happens when the immovable object runs in the unstoppable force michael steiner because
[02:22:20.520 --> 02:22:25.880]  that's where we are here two runaway trains going dead head up against each other the parasites that
[02:22:25.880 --> 02:22:31.720]  want to seize control of the wild wild west country that made us so great they're at loggerheads with
[02:22:31.720 --> 02:22:35.640]  that um i mean they know the truth they know it's about control jimmy kimmel knows he has
[02:22:35.640 --> 02:22:40.520]  armed guards he just wants the trolls down their disarm what happens is this great collision comes
[02:22:40.520 --> 02:22:48.280]  together yeah alex this is a shooting war the left is shooting us now it's a civil war and it's
[02:22:48.280 --> 02:22:54.120]  gone hot and the left they've embraced violence in fact antifa their leaders say violence is necessary
[02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:58.520]  to achieve their goal it's about to say when you have antifa and the islamists and all them saying
[02:22:58.520 --> 02:23:02.280]  we're going to start killing you in october and they're training everywhere and it's all over the
[02:23:02.280 --> 02:23:08.120]  news friday i predicted by october first on friday that was the 29th and 28th and then it starts
[02:23:08.120 --> 02:23:13.480]  happening i mean they are the prime suspects i'm sorry i think your theory about how well repeat
[02:23:13.480 --> 02:23:17.640]  that you said it during the break you mentioned earlier but you really we're almost selling me on
[02:23:17.640 --> 02:23:23.400]  him pissed off at the casino that cut him off well remember this is just a theory as well but we know
[02:23:23.400 --> 02:23:29.640]  that he had tremendous gambling debts well i'm assuming their debts because there are 16 transactions
[02:23:29.640 --> 02:23:35.000]  over 10 000 over the last two weeks so we know he was gambling a lot now i don't know if you know any
[02:23:35.640 --> 02:23:41.240]  addicts any people who are addicted to a substance whether it's gambling or marijuana or cocaine or
[02:23:41.240 --> 02:23:47.560]  or alcohol but if you remove it uh it can really set people off they can go crazy so perhaps he
[02:23:47.560 --> 02:23:51.400]  thought well you know i've spent all this money at the casino now i have nothing they won't give me
[02:23:51.400 --> 02:23:56.600]  a stake uh so i'm going to take my revenge on them i'll show them but instead it sounds like this
[02:23:56.600 --> 02:24:03.480]  guy that had a 400 000 house that was retired for years was incredibly wealthy 160 000 spent the last
[02:24:03.480 --> 02:24:09.560]  month 100 000 he wired the last week uh to the philippines uh it looks like this guy's been giving
[02:24:09.560 --> 02:24:14.440]  a lot of cash well gamblers lose a lot of cash you know there are people who are they can't stop
[02:24:14.440 --> 02:24:19.160]  gambling i so i'm saying why was he all flush with all this money then uh well he had real estate
[02:24:19.160 --> 02:24:22.520]  investments he was an accountant he may have been spending other people's money as well he may have
[02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:26.760]  been taking his clients money and gambling with that look it's just a theory but i want to point
[02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:31.320]  something out alex is that you know people focus on the guns that he had this gentleman had a private
[02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:35.240]  pilot's license he could have flown that into a building he could have flown like the irs building
[02:24:35.240 --> 02:24:40.120]  here in austin right so it's not really the means that are important it's it's the it's the people
[02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:44.520]  behind no no i agree that they're saying people shooting gun videos or talking about guns or
[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:53.880]  hurting people's feelings yes i'm sorry crew just popped my head go ahead well there you go gunman
[02:24:53.880 --> 02:24:57.960]  steven paddock was multimillionaire retiree gambler with no criminal record yeah i remember seeing
[02:24:57.960 --> 02:25:03.720]  that well multimillionaire gamblers gamblers can also lose all their money uh so it it it
[02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:07.560]  doesn't mean it was a success i mean show me a successful gambler by the way i mean how many
[02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:13.160]  people can actually stay ahead of the house so if he's gambling as far as i'm concerned he's losing
[02:25:13.160 --> 02:25:17.560]  and if he's losing that's going to create yeah the house is usually about 65 percent 70 percent
[02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:22.680]  at odds against you i mean uh if you keep winning in a casino they know you're cheating and throw you
[02:25:22.680 --> 02:25:28.440]  out right i mean it's it's a they don't let you win one way or the other well that's not a conspiracy
[02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:33.080]  theory that's the truth as far as i know yeah they have a few highly publicized like my wife
[02:25:33.080 --> 02:25:38.760]  never goes to casinos but once with her dad uh you know up in uh somewhere well he was like outside
[02:25:38.760 --> 02:25:43.880]  Omaha they go she was losing but they went ahead and had her when a jackpot she was good looking
[02:25:43.880 --> 02:25:48.280]  to put her on the big tv's and they everybody starts showing out their money we don't know why
[02:25:48.280 --> 02:25:53.080]  this guy started to kill people i mean he may have been a thrill killer as well that's another
[02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:57.640]  possibility he may have their you have some theories which i'm not entirely on board with but we
[02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:02.520]  don't know the situation yet well most the attacks are islamist or left us now they're saying they're
[02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:06.040]  going to kill us the revolution's coming in october well and they they attack a bunch of people in
[02:26:06.040 --> 02:26:10.600]  a country music deal you got the motive you got the people they target you've got you know all
[02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:14.600]  this i mean i think that's i'm not saying that's what happened that's what it points at you have
[02:26:14.600 --> 02:26:20.040]  isis taken responsibility right well isis takes responsibility for any killing of uh large numbers
[02:26:20.040 --> 02:26:27.800]  of people i mean uh by a civilian certainly look we want to know what his motivations were but the
[02:26:27.800 --> 02:26:31.000]  people on the other side this don't care what his motivations were they're going to blame us
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:35.880]  regardless right so here we are being moral saying we're not sure they're already blaming us
[02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:39.560]  saying all gun owners are terrorist and are responsible michael snider we're going to
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:43.400]  continue with youth the rest of the hour our guest is about to leave us but what's your main
[02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:49.560]  focus when we come back oh i want to talk about what's coming next on november fourth antifa has
[02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:54.280]  said hey we're going to start these protests against trump and we're not going to stop until
[02:26:54.280 --> 02:26:59.320]  trump is removed from office and we can get into who's behind this on the website and the link to
[02:26:59.320 --> 02:27:05.960]  cut radical communist groups in fact the guy and the guy who set up this website he's he's uh got a
[02:27:05.960 --> 02:27:12.680]  book out called the coming civil war so antifas embrace violence the dhs fbi have said that
[02:27:12.680 --> 02:27:17.080]  that they're there on board they're warning that these are domestic terrorists that they've been
[02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:21.560]  involved in domestic terrorism they're saying november fourth it starts and they're saying it's
[02:27:21.560 --> 02:27:27.240]  not going to stop until the trump pence regime ends well we were predicting this was coming
[02:27:27.240 --> 02:27:31.640]  and so the our prediction came true no one can deny that because you got a bunch of leftist groups
[02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:35.720]  saying we're gonna start killing people october first the full war starts november fourth i hope
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:40.040]  it's not the case but it looks like it's starting to happen well these people these antifa people
[02:27:40.040 --> 02:27:45.720]  are just useful idiots they're the the the front end of the spear i agree it's the uh it's the elitist

[02:33:23.880 --> 02:33:28.040]  is that gonna do anything good for the uh fancy uh swiss watchmaker
[02:33:28.040 --> 02:33:35.560]  a lot of smart folks i've talked to thinks he's a total patsy in a cutout and i've talked to a lot
[02:33:35.560 --> 02:33:41.800]  of military folks you know real operators and they say you can clearly in video after video
[02:33:41.800 --> 02:33:49.160]  hear two different types of firearms some type of crank operation or belt fed and then a more
[02:33:49.160 --> 02:34:05.080]  classic semi-auto let's roll some of that footage
[02:34:19.160 --> 02:34:35.080]  so
[02:34:38.360 --> 02:34:43.080]  michael schneider we knew this was coming i mean i hate to sit here and say we were so right
[02:34:43.080 --> 02:34:49.000]  the left is saying october first we start killing i go to gun ranges which i never have time to
[02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:55.480]  go to i've been going to a lot of gun ranges to investigate and they tell me no mainly we have
[02:34:55.480 --> 02:35:00.920]  women and muslims and left to stand here training for civil war and then i run into the truth about
[02:35:00.920 --> 02:35:06.680]  guns guiding you together a bunch of muslim women in there well i talked to the owners
[02:35:06.680 --> 02:35:10.200]  and i'm not going to get into all of it but uh and i'm going to tell you where i was at and
[02:35:10.200 --> 02:35:14.120]  they said now i was four groups that day and i'm sure they're great people the point is is that
[02:35:14.120 --> 02:35:21.320]  the left is finally coming in and firing firearms and a lot of the left are saying they're getting
[02:35:21.320 --> 02:35:27.560]  ready for this war and then if you had a jewish synagogue attacked like this by a gunman or
[02:35:28.840 --> 02:35:34.200]  a black church you know pretty much a few hours into it you say i bet it was a white supremacist
[02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:41.960]  or i bet it was uh you know a uh islamist but you've got a predominantly white christian
[02:35:41.960 --> 02:35:51.160]  conservative veteran type group uh being attacked a country music venue with 23 000 people and oh right
[02:35:51.160 --> 02:35:56.680]  away oh no this has no connection to them being white or christian or conservative even though
[02:35:56.680 --> 02:36:03.560]  the left is saying from cbs vice presidents to movie stars to cnn they deserve to die their
[02:36:03.560 --> 02:36:11.560]  republicans they supported trump maybe they'll learn from this so you've got the target that
[02:36:11.560 --> 02:36:15.880]  gives you a motive you've got isis taken responsibility and even associated press said
[02:36:15.880 --> 02:36:20.840]  isis usually is truthful when they take responsibility for something they didn't take
[02:36:20.840 --> 02:36:25.560]  responsibility for the knife attack in france sunday or the car attack even though the guy had
[02:36:25.560 --> 02:36:30.840]  an isis flag and was yelling a la bar in canada but they did take credit for this and the media
[02:36:30.840 --> 02:36:37.080]  says oh no that's not true what do you make of this michael steiner yeah and then you had that
[02:36:37.080 --> 02:36:42.360]  lady running around 45 minutes beforehand telling people oh you're all going to die i mean clearly
[02:36:42.360 --> 02:36:47.480]  you know this was something people knew in advance it wasn't just a lone wolf but alex you know
[02:36:47.480 --> 02:36:52.280]  regardless of this event how people want to spin it i'm entirely convinced it was a direct attack
[02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:58.040]  on trump supporters we know that on november fourth if you go to refuse fascism dot org
[02:36:58.040 --> 02:37:01.720]  they've got a big press release about it they're saying they're going to take to the streets and
[02:37:01.720 --> 02:37:05.560]  this isn't going to be like occupy wall and by the way this is a big group and then we
[02:37:05.560 --> 02:37:11.640]  paul had the article friday with scores of videos from crowder and veritas drudge linked to it
[02:37:11.640 --> 02:37:17.080]  where they're saying we're going to attack and start killing november fourth i mean
[02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:22.120]  but i've been to a bunch of gun ranges they're all say the left's there and they go oh do you
[02:37:22.120 --> 02:37:27.480]  wake up about the second but they go no we're ready for war yeah and the people behind refuse
[02:37:27.480 --> 02:37:32.280]  fascism dot org it's directly linked to the revolutionary communist party here in the united
[02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:37.240]  states and the individual that leads that party has actually written a book entitled the coming
[02:37:37.240 --> 02:37:42.120]  civil war and they're openly talking about yeah we're going to use violence and they justify it
[02:37:42.120 --> 02:37:48.280]  this way they consider donald trump to be another hitler and they say whatever we have to do to stop
[02:37:48.280 --> 02:37:53.160]  the rise of another hitler we're going to do including violence so they believe they're
[02:37:53.160 --> 02:37:59.160]  justified in using violence and they're actually training with guns training with knives all this
[02:37:59.160 --> 02:38:04.520]  they're training in the middle east to use violence to use black block tactics with the
[02:38:04.520 --> 02:38:09.880]  revolutionary communist party hey i said on sunday with my counterterrorism expert listen i had a
[02:38:09.880 --> 02:38:14.920]  former high level cia guy on yesterday he thinks it's a false flag against trump supporters as well
[02:38:14.920 --> 02:38:20.360]  and he ran whole operations i mean plus the threats by former deputy directors that they're
[02:38:20.360 --> 02:38:25.160]  going to kill trump that is a direct threat to the president and i was told by cia sources that
[02:38:25.160 --> 02:38:32.520]  kimmel before it was ever in the news was getting deep state democrat direction that's now confirmed
[02:38:32.520 --> 02:38:40.600]  here by the hill and the associated press and they told me no that kimmel thing is a direct
[02:38:40.600 --> 02:38:45.400]  threat when he puts the gun out and says we're going to kill you alex jones uh if you don't
[02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:50.520]  leave our new world order alone that that was a direct threat that they are communicating with us
[02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:56.360]  through these programs yeah alex and this uh this movement starting up on november 4 they
[02:38:56.360 --> 02:39:01.800]  say they only have one goal one demand and that's the removal of the trump pence regime by any means
[02:39:01.800 --> 02:39:06.120]  necessary and they're openly saying they're willing to use violence to do it so why aren't these people
[02:39:06.120 --> 02:39:11.080]  all in prison for directly threatening the president directly threatening the constitution in fact the
[02:39:11.080 --> 02:39:17.400]  revolutionary communist party has drafted actually drafted a constitution for a post-american order
[02:39:17.400 --> 02:39:23.640]  to replace the u.s constitution for a north american socialist which is exactly what uh
[02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:28.600]  larry grathwald the green beret who infiltrated them uh the highest levels of the weathermen
[02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:34.280]  they were planning this in the 70s it's the exact same plan it absolutely is and so they
[02:39:34.280 --> 02:39:38.440]  were they're openly saying they want to overthrow the united states government they want to take
[02:39:38.440 --> 02:39:42.920]  down trump by any means necessary and so when we they're you know take an oath to protect and
[02:39:42.920 --> 02:39:46.840]  defend the constitution in the united states these are the kind of guys we're talking about
[02:39:46.840 --> 02:39:51.640]  these are bad guys these are violent guys and they're not they're not just going to attack trump
[02:39:51.640 --> 02:39:56.760]  but conservatives conservative politicians which i'm alarmed about because i'm out there doing
[02:39:56.760 --> 02:40:02.840]  campaign events but we need to understand what we're up against we're up against violent revolutionaries
[02:40:02.840 --> 02:40:07.640]  they're going to use violence they want a civil war they want american cities to burn all the
[02:40:07.640 --> 02:40:11.960]  things we've been warning about for so long and it's all coming through right the october 1 they said
[02:40:11.960 --> 02:40:17.000]  it starts November 4th at peaks and i was like on sunday saying get ready today for it to happen
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:21.800]  it's here but but the but the most and laura loomer we'd already have her on but her skype
[02:40:21.800 --> 02:40:26.280]  was breaking up let's go to her right now laura loomer thank you so much investigative journalists
[02:40:26.280 --> 02:40:32.440]  confronting hillary umma abadine confronting the kill trump uh thespian activity with shakespeare
[02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:37.000]  in the park great to have you here uh you've done some big research the memo from the ceo
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:45.560]  right of the mandalay bay in the casino telling employees to donate to a super hardcore uh left
[02:40:45.560 --> 02:40:52.680]  this cop killer associated groups yeah i have exclusively obtained an internal memo that uh
[02:40:52.680 --> 02:40:58.840]  jim marin the ceo of mgm resorts which owns um mandalay where this attack took place and if you
[02:40:58.840 --> 02:41:03.000]  read it you can see that he's uh telling his employees that he will match donations if they
[02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:10.600]  donate to groups like care which is a terrorist organization uh splc which the fbi cut ties with
[02:41:10.600 --> 02:41:17.400]  over their own um you know inspiration of domestic terrorism and then the adl which of course is
[02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:23.800]  very anti trump so he's funneling in millions of dollars worth of uh you know company shareholder
[02:41:23.800 --> 02:41:31.720]  money uh to fund these uh you know radical islamic and anti trump organizations and i agree with you
[02:41:31.720 --> 02:41:36.600]  alice i think this is a false flag i i don't think that isis is just going to claim responsibility
[02:41:36.600 --> 02:41:42.200]  for an attack that they didn't have anything to do with um i was on your show about two weeks ago
[02:41:42.200 --> 02:41:48.600]  and you and i were discussing how antifa is now adopting isis tactics and we've seen over the past
[02:41:48.600 --> 02:41:53.160]  few months that the left has aligned itself with islam we see it through the women's march we see it
[02:41:53.160 --> 02:41:59.080]  with um the way they create their own logos infusing them with women wearing hijabs and they
[02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:04.280]  cover their face in black attire just like isis and they wave black oh yeah the left is merging
[02:42:04.280 --> 02:42:09.480]  with radical islam and linda sir sir we're being force fed it right yeah no we'll stay there let's
[02:42:09.480 --> 02:42:15.320]  talk about this bombshell memo you guy uh that that we're that we're retweeting at real alex jones

[02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:37.720]  highest quality that there is available according to their own testers they inadvertently didn't
[02:48:37.720 --> 02:48:41.800]  point that out but they listed on their site that actually the company we private label for is the

[02:49:03.160 --> 02:49:11.800]  we have the fluoride free toothpaste and more so continuing laura loomer you got this exclusive
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:16.440]  documentation you're just such a great sleuth uh that you've got the owners of mandalay bay saying
[02:49:16.440 --> 02:49:23.000]  they'll match give you fund any of the basic antifa support groups uh what does your gut
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:29.640]  tell you about this i mean again if we saw a a big rap concert shot up by a white guy you
[02:49:29.640 --> 02:49:33.240]  think he was a white supremacist they would just say that or if a jewish center got attacked you'd
[02:49:33.240 --> 02:49:38.760]  say he's a white supremacist or or might be an islamist but just oh just ignore all that even
[02:49:38.760 --> 02:49:44.760]  though isis is taking credit what do you think's happening well i i think that this guy is um you
[02:49:44.760 --> 02:49:52.120]  know a hardcore leftist with antifa connection to became radicalized um you know through isis
[02:49:52.120 --> 02:49:56.840]  and i believe isis is claimed that they're responsible for this attack because they're
[02:49:56.840 --> 02:50:01.960]  claiming that he converted to islam and you see a lot of these leftists that are embracing islam
[02:50:01.960 --> 02:50:09.640]  so i think that it has both antifa and islamic um you know connections i also think that uh
[02:50:09.640 --> 02:50:14.280]  there's no doubt that there's those i mean that's the only thing we've got clear tracks on
[02:50:14.280 --> 02:50:19.800]  the target the connections who took credit my hostage rescue team i mean i had a former guy
[02:50:19.800 --> 02:50:24.840]  that ran cia operations on yesterday i talked to the president sometimes it's not like my sources
[02:50:24.840 --> 02:50:29.560]  aren't real hell matt drudge gave me the only interview in the last two years i have the hostage
[02:50:29.560 --> 02:50:36.040]  rescue team telling me the hotel room was full of antifa and islamic literature and they're pissed
[02:50:36.040 --> 02:50:41.880]  because their bosses won't give it out we know in fact i'm so so conservative i'm saying we don't
[02:50:41.880 --> 02:50:47.320]  well then the hostage rescue team's lying to me well the same folks told my reporters get out of
[02:50:47.320 --> 02:50:54.840]  here a few days before what happened uh in in in uh oregon so these are real sources go ahead sorry
[02:50:54.840 --> 02:50:58.920]  no i i believe you and i i i'm in agreement with you and i'm sorry i keep looking at my phone but
[02:50:58.920 --> 02:51:05.640]  i'm getting um lifetime updates from employees who are working inside um the mgm resort and they're
[02:51:05.640 --> 02:51:09.640]  telling me and see we're getting all these two at real alex jones which is great i'm glad laura's
[02:51:09.640 --> 02:51:15.320]  on them look at the tips give us updates laura tell us what's happening uh so i'm being told that
[02:51:16.040 --> 02:51:21.400]  that the killer was a platinum member and platinum members tend to have contact easy
[02:51:21.400 --> 02:51:28.280]  contact with hotel executives so it is possible that uh this the shooter steven paddock had a
[02:51:28.280 --> 02:51:36.200]  relationship with jim meren the ceo of mgm resorts and it's also noteworthy that uh jim meren's wife
[02:51:36.200 --> 02:51:41.720]  heather meren i'm reading this from my phone right now from uh sources um she served in obama's
[02:51:41.720 --> 02:51:48.760]  administration so she was an obama administration employee well laura let me just give you credit
[02:51:48.760 --> 02:51:52.600]  here and i know we've been discussing and talking about you being here at info wars i think if we
[02:51:52.600 --> 02:51:57.640]  hire you what we need to do is have you in charge of our twitter sleuthing because we have all these
[02:51:57.640 --> 02:52:01.800]  private messages coming in but you end up getting the documents you actually we have a great crew
[02:52:01.800 --> 02:52:05.480]  you're the type folks we need i think i think we just need to go ahead and do it because we've been
[02:52:05.480 --> 02:52:09.160]  discussing it and you actually work for info wars and i think not just your investigative journalism
[02:52:09.160 --> 02:52:13.240]  but how you got the document obviously from employees and now you're talking to them in
[02:52:13.240 --> 02:52:18.600]  live time and finding out who's real and getting the documents i mean this is this is true journalism
[02:52:18.600 --> 02:52:23.720]  what you're engaging in right and one more thing that also just um you know gives more evidence to
[02:52:23.720 --> 02:52:31.480]  the isis connection is um an employee who works for mandalay told me that she went to um to the uh
[02:52:31.480 --> 02:52:37.640]  to the union offices right and they're in all of the doors are plastered with those uh you remember
[02:52:37.640 --> 02:52:42.120]  those uh refuse fascism signs with a woman the democratic signs with the woman in the hijab
[02:52:42.120 --> 02:52:49.160]  yes all of linda's for sure those are plastered all over the union office for um mgm casinos
[02:52:49.160 --> 02:52:54.840]  oh we've got dm photos of that yet i'm going to be obtaining photos and i'm going to you know release
[02:52:54.840 --> 02:52:59.800]  them as soon as i obtain them i have multiple sources on the ground employees of mgm who are
[02:52:59.800 --> 02:53:04.760]  of mgm who are sending the information there's no doubt laura loomer i don't know how you do it
[02:53:04.760 --> 02:53:09.240]  you're you're a true i'm not just i'm not kissing your butt but this is what journalists used to do
[02:53:09.240 --> 02:53:14.280]  what she's doing working sources this is incredible uh michael schneider final comments
[02:53:15.560 --> 02:53:19.880]  yeah but the mainstream media they're not doing their job and the you know this doesn't fit their
[02:53:19.880 --> 02:53:23.320]  narrative so they don't want to talk about it they don't want to talk about a connection
[02:53:23.320 --> 02:53:29.000]  to nt they shot up a bunch of people in a country deal at a big liberal casino and they were walking
[02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:35.000]  into a trap it's so clear alex one more thing um just to go off of what your uh what the guest is
[02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:41.080]  saying i was undercover in refuse fascism right like i i no longer used to work with project veritas
[02:53:41.640 --> 02:53:47.080]  right and i was undercover inside the refuse fascism office and i know firsthand from being
[02:53:47.080 --> 02:53:52.360]  inside their new york office having access to people like samsara taylor and their leaders
[02:53:52.360 --> 02:53:57.560]  connected to the rev calm movement these people are violent and they are very passive about violence
[02:53:57.560 --> 02:54:02.680]  they don't have sympathy for when trump supporters are attacked i had access to their computers
[02:54:02.680 --> 02:54:09.000]  okay i had access to their paperwork these people are violent these people support islam and these
[02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:14.840]  people give an excuse and a total pass for jihadi terror absolutely we're gonna come back to you
[02:54:14.840 --> 02:54:20.280]  for a little bit more lore lomer after we get a final comment uh from uh our guest michael schneider
[02:54:20.280 --> 02:54:26.120]  i mean look the left's been saying the revolution's coming they say hashtag hunt republicans cnn's
[02:54:26.120 --> 02:54:31.240]  you know has a friend on of the shooter of scolese and says he's a hero i mean they really think
[02:54:31.240 --> 02:54:35.400]  they're gonna have a war and then deny they're doing it while they do it of course they're the
[02:54:35.400 --> 02:54:41.000]  suspects and then isis took credit schneider i agree with you in the video and rino looks exactly
[02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:47.720]  let's roll that behind me that that shot of him that looks like him yeah it absolutely does alex
[02:54:47.720 --> 02:54:52.920]  we need to understand that they're they have declared war they want it to be violent and so
[02:54:52.920 --> 02:54:56.680]  trump is a target we need to pray for him and his family and everyone in his administration
[02:54:56.680 --> 02:55:00.760]  but alex you are a target everyone in your staff we need to be in prayer for you
[02:55:00.760 --> 02:55:04.920]  i'm a target because i'm openly saying i want to go to congress and be donald trump's best friend
[02:55:04.920 --> 02:55:08.840]  and so in the media when the left figures out who i am and then i'm a friend of alex jones and
[02:55:08.840 --> 02:55:12.840]  and everything else i'm gonna be the most hated person running for congress in the entire country
[02:55:12.840 --> 02:55:17.080]  they're gonna come after me we're all targets we need to understand what we're in for but we don't
[02:55:17.080 --> 02:55:21.560]  need to be back down this is a time to be brave to be bold to stand up because we don't stand up
[02:55:21.560 --> 02:55:27.080]  the radical left is going to take over we can't let that happen they believe they've lost politically
[02:55:27.080 --> 02:55:30.200]  and they have culture they're going for violence they've said they're doing it they're making their
[02:55:30.200 --> 02:55:35.720]  move yeah they absolutely do and their literature and their books everything they openly embrace
[02:55:35.720 --> 02:55:40.120]  violence they say we're going to be violent we make no apologies for it and when people openly
[02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:43.960]  say that i don't know why the authorities aren't arresting them but when they openly say we're
[02:55:43.960 --> 02:55:48.600]  going to commit violence that's a huge red flag and we need to watch out it starts november 4th
[02:55:48.600 --> 02:55:52.680]  it's going to be all over the country people need to get ready for this and the police said he was
[02:55:52.680 --> 02:55:57.320]  known to them they need to say i know they got investigations going but they need to say because
[02:55:57.320 --> 02:56:01.080]  they use investigations the government does to shut down the truth not the police but the
[02:56:01.080 --> 02:56:06.040]  higher ups they need to say why he was known to them and you know it's going to be antifa because
[02:56:06.040 --> 02:56:11.400]  it looks just like him getting in the cop's face on the video and i mean if it hadn't him it's his
[02:56:11.400 --> 02:56:19.640]  twin brother yeah alex why did it take 72 minutes why was the shooting allowed to continue or 72
[02:56:19.640 --> 02:56:25.640]  minutes that boggles my mind i don't know you know there's so much of this looks like a setup
[02:56:25.640 --> 02:56:30.600]  like it was staged we should look at the insurance of mandalay bay just like 9 11 we should look at
[02:56:30.600 --> 02:56:36.760]  the insurance of that yeah absolutely there's so many unanswered questions that we need questions to
[02:56:36.760 --> 02:56:40.360]  and the mainstream media is dropping the ball they don't want to look into this because they're
[02:56:40.360 --> 02:56:44.440]  afraid where it might be right michael schneider the economic collapse blog dot com michael sign

[02:59:58.840 --> 03:00:06.280]  it's alex jones revolution in their minds the children start to march and they want death
[03:00:06.280 --> 03:00:10.840]  they are the leftists they are upon us laura lemur is just an incredible investigative journalist
[03:00:10.840 --> 03:00:15.800]  the way she keeps just ferreting out huge news when she was at veritas and then rebel and now
[03:00:15.800 --> 03:00:21.480]  independent uh the way you know she's broken this huge news here we know the mandalay bay
[03:00:21.480 --> 03:00:27.480]  owners are huge leftist globalists but now this guy being a platinum member of the internal documents
[03:00:27.480 --> 03:00:32.600]  where they were matching money uh to groups that congress is trying to ban his terror groups
[03:00:33.720 --> 03:00:39.080]  islamist's groups and then you tie this into kit daniel's article and our and our reporters in
[03:00:39.080 --> 03:00:45.240]  syria about the antifa working with them here i mean this is serious this is a real takeover
[03:00:46.280 --> 03:00:50.440]  just like it says in the wiki leagues where george soro says we're going to overthrow israel
[03:00:52.040 --> 03:00:57.240]  and the united states in 2017 they were going to put hillary in and do it this is a total
[03:00:57.240 --> 03:01:01.560]  alliance with the muslims and let's just get it out there that doesn't mean all the muslims a lot
[03:01:01.560 --> 03:01:06.600]  of muslims are heretics and trying to get out of it but as the cult goes that's the army of the left
[03:01:06.600 --> 03:01:12.440]  laura lumar amazing other key points you want to relay well uh i would just like to read something
[03:01:12.440 --> 03:01:17.640]  a message that i received from somebody who has direct access to the booking information at the
[03:01:17.640 --> 03:01:22.360]  mandalay um it's it's going to take a minute but it's really important so there are two separate
[03:01:22.360 --> 03:01:27.640]  rooms that this guy booked it's not one room as as the police are trying to say they're trying to
[03:01:27.640 --> 03:01:33.240]  say that it's a suite it's actually two separate rooms and um he could have booked them at the
[03:01:33.240 --> 03:01:39.560]  same time but um the suite had his name on it and the other room had his girlfriend's name on it
[03:01:39.560 --> 03:01:44.280]  so first we're being told that the girlfriend is in the philippines and then well when all of this
[03:01:44.280 --> 03:01:49.560]  was happening and they um they released her name as a suspect they said that they had detained her
[03:01:49.560 --> 03:01:53.720]  but then we find out that she's in the philippines which as we know has a huge isis problem right
[03:01:53.720 --> 03:01:58.840]  now i mean isis has totally taken over the town of morari so the girlfriend has an islamic angle
[03:01:58.840 --> 03:02:05.560]  as well there were room changes for um and charges for both of the rooms so they redirected where
[03:02:05.560 --> 03:02:12.040]  room service was going so that's a big red flag right there because if he was setting up this um
[03:02:12.040 --> 03:02:17.160]  you know killer environment full of assault rifles and all of these other weapons and explosives
[03:02:17.160 --> 03:02:22.840]  like tannerite um to kill people that would explain why he redirected room service charges to the
[03:02:22.840 --> 03:02:29.240]  other room which he had placed in his his girlfriend's name um they said typically the room will be
[03:02:29.240 --> 03:02:34.760]  taken care of as well as the vip guests gamble enough on their trip um it's possible that they
[03:02:34.760 --> 03:02:41.240]  had a relationship with the ceo uh with him being a platinum uh oh clearly he was being
[03:02:41.240 --> 03:02:47.000]  clearly whether he's a patsy or not is a cutout he was being protected they standard when you check
[03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:51.400]  in they come when you leave they search your crap every time they come they toss your room

[03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:54.600]  forensic psychologist says hey it's a bunch of right wingers leftists would target that
[03:09:54.600 --> 03:09:59.880]  that's your first big clue what i keep hammering then isis takes responsibility but they normally
[03:09:59.880 --> 03:10:05.320]  do that that means they're behind it the left claiming in newsweek that i made it up jones
[03:10:05.320 --> 03:10:11.080]  claims isis took responsibility when they didn't that was a headline yesterday jones blames deep
[03:10:11.080 --> 03:10:17.880]  state this type of desperate behavior them claiming this big violent wands was coming uh on october
[03:10:17.880 --> 03:10:23.800]  first this is all critical and it's critical for you to get these articles out on facebook
[03:10:23.800 --> 03:10:29.960]  and twitter and your email and by hand and walk local talk shows because we're in an info war
[03:10:29.960 --> 03:10:36.040]  war i now take you to london where paul watson will host the balance of the transmission paul watson
[03:10:37.720 --> 03:10:42.200]  thanks alex yes we are here live we have a video clip coming up in fact let me know when you've
[03:10:42.200 --> 03:10:47.560]  got that ready as alex just discussed big article went up on info wars dot com about an hour ago
[03:10:47.560 --> 03:10:54.440]  forensic psychiatrist suggests gunman may have deliberately targeted conservatives this is
[03:10:54.440 --> 03:11:00.920]  dr michael wellner he went on fox and friends this morning made the point as alex just said and it's
[03:11:00.920 --> 03:11:06.120]  a point that we made in the immediate aftermath of the shooting oh and by the way two hours before
[03:11:06.120 --> 03:11:12.120]  the shooting as you can see right now open info wars dot com as well the audience was singing along
[03:11:12.120 --> 03:11:19.240]  with the people on stage god bless america two hours before the shooting began now this forensic
[03:11:19.240 --> 03:11:25.800]  psychiatrist dr michael wellner laid it out on fox news he made the point that people who commit
[03:11:25.800 --> 03:11:31.960]  these kind of stranger mass homicides when they don't know the victims it's not workplace violence
[03:11:31.960 --> 03:11:37.080]  it's a mass homicide attack it's not an attack on somebody's family they don't know the victims
[03:11:37.640 --> 03:11:45.080]  when they do it for notoriety they see the crowd at the country music festival singing god bless
[03:11:45.080 --> 03:11:49.880]  america two hours before the attack now the psychiatrist made the point and we're going to
[03:11:49.880 --> 03:11:56.200]  go to this clip in a minute here when young people carry out terror attacks or mass shooting attacks
[03:11:56.200 --> 03:12:00.920]  and we have it ready we'll go to it in a second they do it for one of two reasons it's either for
[03:12:00.920 --> 03:12:09.080]  notoriety or in pursuit of a political or personal cause in almost every single example the ones who
[03:12:09.080 --> 03:12:15.560]  do it for notoriety are almost always young men this was not a young man what was he 64 years old
[03:12:16.440 --> 03:12:19.480]  why would he do it for notoriety it makes no sense there's no
[03:12:20.360 --> 03:12:27.080]  hint of mental he was doing it for political power to trigger a helter skelter charlie manson style
[03:12:27.080 --> 03:12:34.280]  race war system let's go to the video alex because he lays it out on his appearance with fox and
[03:12:34.280 --> 03:12:39.000]  friends let's go to the clip it's now after the hour investigators now trying to figure out why a
[03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:45.240]  gunman opened fire with 23 firearms in his hotel at 19 back at his house killing at least 59 people
[03:12:45.240 --> 03:12:50.760]  and injuring hundreds more according to his brother there was no clues he would commit such a horrific
[03:12:50.760 --> 03:13:01.160]  attack a religious affiliation no political affiliation no he just hung out or shocked horrified
[03:13:01.160 --> 03:13:08.600]  completely dumbfounded i don't buy this right about this so what goes on in the mind of a
[03:13:08.600 --> 03:13:13.800]  shooter like this as they shoot at innocent people here now to discuss this is dr michael
[03:13:13.800 --> 03:13:19.480]  wellner he's a top forensic psychiatrist who has personally examined a number of mass killers
[03:13:19.480 --> 03:13:23.720]  dr thank you for being with us morning what happened what's going on here well if you want
[03:13:23.720 --> 03:13:29.160]  to understand the killer the most important place to start is with the victims and what we can
[03:13:29.160 --> 03:13:36.200]  immediately see is that he had no relationship to the killers a workplace mass shooter knows his
[03:13:36.840 --> 03:13:41.160]  victims and they want to see the victim and they want to destroy annihilate the workplace it's
[03:13:41.160 --> 03:13:46.520]  another key point the family mass shooter knows the family wants to annihilate the family the criminal
[03:13:46.520 --> 03:13:53.240]  enterprise wants to kill a gang so it's a stranger mass homicide and a stranger mass homicide happens
[03:13:53.240 --> 03:13:58.920]  for one of two reasons either a person acting for a cause or a person acting because he wants to
[03:13:58.920 --> 03:14:04.520]  transcend notoriety and kill as many people as possible like a james holmes however james
[03:14:04.520 --> 03:14:10.440]  holmes who was the uh who was the aurora shooter and you worked on that case yes here's the thing
[03:14:11.400 --> 03:14:18.520]  shooting for notoriety's sake and nothing more is a young man's crime and this is a 64-year-old
[03:14:18.520 --> 03:14:24.440]  with no dramatic mental illness no major decline someone who's intact i think if we want to understand
[03:14:24.440 --> 03:14:30.200]  what's behind the crime we should look at james hodgkinson the shooter of congressman scolese
[03:14:30.200 --> 03:14:37.080]  because that crime itself yes was intended to be a spectacle and and of much bigger scope imagine
[03:14:37.080 --> 03:14:43.720]  this what he intended to do hodgkinson was not only kill all of those lawmakers republicans but
[03:14:43.720 --> 03:14:49.320]  in doing so we would have had to have special elections to replace all of them and if it weren't
[03:14:49.320 --> 03:14:56.120]  for the security people who who intercepted him you had all kinds of congressmen and lawmakers
[03:14:56.120 --> 03:15:02.520]  in a dugout defenseless who would have been mowed down my my point is a spectacle is i'd
[03:15:02.520 --> 03:15:08.040]  attempted to cause this guy dr michael welner is incredible he's saying everything i've been
[03:15:08.040 --> 03:15:12.200]  saying paul i'm gonna turn this back over to you but let's back this up 30 seconds let's come back
[03:15:12.200 --> 03:15:16.680]  about a minute and finish this clip out of break and then paul is taking over this video this

[03:19:28.120 --> 03:19:32.600]  together we're changing the world now it's time to change our bodies with z shield and info wars
[03:19:32.600 --> 03:19:44.680]  live dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:20:03.000 --> 03:20:09.560]  we're live it is full power of the alex jones show we're going to go back to that video in a
[03:20:09.560 --> 03:20:15.320]  second this is a top forensic psychiatrist who worked on the james home shooting of course
[03:20:15.320 --> 03:20:21.000]  that motive was mainly for him to gain notoriety of course mental illness was involved as well
[03:20:21.000 --> 03:20:26.600]  the batman shooter of course now he's gone on fox news this morning he's saying basically and he'll
[03:20:26.600 --> 03:20:31.720]  lay it out we're going to play the clip the rest of it in a sec look this was a country music concert
[03:20:31.720 --> 03:20:38.440]  this was an attack on americana this was an attack on gun owners who have been dehumanized and demonized
[03:20:38.440 --> 03:20:44.200]  by the media at the end of the clip he outright says that cnn bears some responsibility for this
[03:20:44.200 --> 03:20:49.720]  shooting again if you want to ask whether he was more likely radicalized by isis or cnn for the
[03:20:49.720 --> 03:20:54.680]  moment it's looking like cnn of course we wait for more information to come in let's go to the
[03:20:54.680 --> 03:21:00.440]  rest of this clip though this is forensic psychiatrist dr michael wellner on fox news this morning here
[03:21:00.440 --> 03:21:08.920]  it is here's the thing shooting for notoriety's sake and nothing more is a young man's crime
[03:21:08.920 --> 03:21:15.560]  and this is a 64 year old with no dramatic mental illness no major decline someone who's intact i
[03:21:15.560 --> 03:21:20.280]  think if we want to understand what's behind the crime we should look at james hodgkinson the
[03:21:20.280 --> 03:21:27.160]  shooter of congressman scolese because that crime itself was intended to be a spectacle
[03:21:27.160 --> 03:21:34.040]  and and of much bigger scope imagine this what he intended to do hodgkinson was not only kill all of
[03:21:34.040 --> 03:21:39.640]  those lawmakers republicans but in doing so we would have had to have special elections to replace
[03:21:39.640 --> 03:21:46.680]  all of them and if it weren't for the security people who who intercepted him you had all
[03:21:46.680 --> 03:21:52.360]  kinds of congressmen and lawmakers in a dugout defenseless who would have been mowed down my
[03:21:52.360 --> 03:21:59.080]  point is a spectacle is either designed to cause some derivative impact or to instigate
[03:21:59.080 --> 03:22:06.360]  some cause discussion so the point is he's an older man there's no definable mental history or
[03:22:06.360 --> 03:22:11.960]  decline and yet it happens now now if there is a cause there will be a manifesto there will be a
[03:22:11.960 --> 03:22:17.240]  communication with the television uh or other kind of media or social media it will be out there
[03:22:17.240 --> 03:22:22.920]  if there's nothing to necessarily tie him to a cause then instigating is enough and that's
[03:22:22.920 --> 03:22:28.760]  exactly what the parallel is with another older man's crime hodgkinson spectacle crime just like
[03:22:28.760 --> 03:22:34.920]  the person who flew a plane into the irs people who commit crimes for notoriety alone are young
[03:22:34.920 --> 03:22:40.600]  and he's not what about genetics because his dad was on the fb i must wanted less was a bank robber
[03:22:40.600 --> 03:22:47.560]  well the the genetics of psychopathy are you know of course 50 percent we inherit roughly but in
[03:22:47.560 --> 03:22:52.680]  terms of the genetics of psychopathy they may be as important as as environment one thing that you
[03:22:52.680 --> 03:22:57.080]  want to appreciate about the the uh... hold on one second splitting the screen with the president
[03:22:57.080 --> 03:23:01.400]  united states he's arriving at joint base andrew's and he's going to be heading over to port urico
[03:23:01.400 --> 03:23:06.520]  shortly of course you know he uh... greets the military u.s. courts and uh over to air force one
[03:23:06.520 --> 03:23:13.720]  okay go ahead tying into the president people who commit mass killings of folks that they don't know
[03:23:13.720 --> 03:23:18.280]  have to be detached and he's attached these many floors ways killing them through a scope
[03:23:18.280 --> 03:23:23.960]  they're dehumanized here's the big here's the big take home in terms of what we can do to prevent
[03:23:25.080 --> 03:23:31.560]  absolutely people who are gun enthusiasts and who are populists or nationalists in this country
[03:23:31.560 --> 03:23:37.320]  are dehumanized they're demonized i i don't i travel all over the united states i don't
[03:23:37.320 --> 03:23:44.680]  experience hatred i turn on the television in in certain media and i see these people demonized
[03:23:44.680 --> 03:23:52.280]  when you have a cbs news executive who talks about um not having sympathy the point is his mindset
[03:23:52.280 --> 03:23:57.160]  is that they deserve to die yes and so a person who adopts a cause may be otherwise law abiding
[03:23:57.160 --> 03:24:03.800]  but he's he feels righteously justified that the end justifies the means so we're talking now about
[03:24:03.800 --> 03:24:09.880]  gun control because he he committed an over-the-top gun crime doesn't mean that guns was the ideology
[03:24:09.880 --> 03:24:15.000]  what i'm saying is it's the idea of instigating and a means to an end with people you dehumanize
[03:24:15.000 --> 03:24:19.720]  all right let's sit back whether this or racism who you're shooting at you said look at the target
[03:24:19.720 --> 03:24:24.200]  and work your way backwards that's right what the country music fans and country music artists
[03:24:24.200 --> 03:24:30.360]  represent it's americana it could be guns i'm not suggesting that i know the ideology look
[03:24:30.360 --> 03:24:34.680]  it could be that he had an issue with las vegas but my my point is because this is you know this
[03:24:34.680 --> 03:24:41.960]  is a national event it's in las vegas but my my point is cause cause is is pointed out by what he
[03:24:41.960 --> 03:24:47.640]  says he's going to either lay it out or or he's smart enough to know what this would instigate
[03:24:47.640 --> 03:24:53.640]  otherwise one can't speculate what i am saying is when you kill complete strangers and try to kill
[03:24:53.640 --> 03:24:58.200]  as many as possible you're trying to create a spectacle and when you're not a young person
[03:24:58.200 --> 03:25:03.880]  you've evolved past the immaturity that says if i kill as many people as i can't people will think
[03:25:03.880 --> 03:25:09.720]  i'm somebody he's more mature than that jeff selen he says that this is uh the country music fans
[03:25:09.720 --> 03:25:14.120]  for the most part are republican and the president by showing this type of sympathy is doing something
[03:25:14.120 --> 03:25:19.240]  for his base does he our country music fans symbolic of republicans well i think that cnn's
[03:25:19.240 --> 03:25:23.960]  going to have to answer for how they demonize gun enthusiasts and how cnn actually contributes to
[03:25:23.960 --> 03:25:29.480]  mass shooting uh and and i believe that they do but that's a side issue i think look the president
[03:25:29.480 --> 03:25:33.720]  has a responsibility anytime there's a national disaster whether it's here or whether it's port
[03:25:33.720 --> 03:25:39.960]  or rico to console the nation i think that's the end of it that is forensic psychiatrist dr
[03:25:39.960 --> 03:25:45.000]  michael wellnett on fox and friends this morning basically making the point this was not done
[03:25:45.000 --> 03:25:51.000]  whatever motive was not done for notoriety the guy's 64 years old it just doesn't happen
[03:25:51.000 --> 03:25:56.200]  he's worked on these cases before he worked on the james home's case he's saying this was obviously
[03:25:56.200 --> 03:26:01.800]  in pursuit it's the only explanation left that it's in pursuit of a political or personal cause we
[03:26:01.800 --> 03:26:07.880]  don't know of any mental illness problems with this shooter whether that emerges later remains
[03:26:07.880 --> 03:26:13.400]  to be seen but again look at the target country music festival they're singing god bless america
[03:26:13.400 --> 03:26:19.080]  two hours before some of them according to one eyewitness get a warning 45 minutes before the
[03:26:19.080 --> 03:26:26.280]  shooting begins who goes to a country music concert that was why the i mean i satirized to some extent
[03:26:26.280 --> 03:26:32.440]  the people who were blaming this on white supremacism and saying that this was the white supremacist
[03:26:32.440 --> 03:26:37.880]  patriarchy's fault because yeah yeah that's the first people i'd target if i were a white supremacist
[03:26:37.880 --> 03:26:45.480]  is a country music concert full of republican trump supporters mainly the ones who were political
[03:26:45.480 --> 03:26:50.920]  and of course white people makes absolutely no sense we still don't know the motive nearly two
[03:26:50.920 --> 03:26:57.320]  days after this we know very little about it they've dug up some voter registration thing out of
[03:26:57.320 --> 03:27:04.040]  florida from 1984 with his name registered democrat is it him we don't know there's no confirmation
[03:27:04.040 --> 03:27:08.920]  of anything there's a lot of disinformation that's coming out of both the mainstream media and the
[03:27:08.920 --> 03:27:13.720]  alternative media that's why we need to be very careful about these things in fact some websites
[03:27:13.720 --> 03:27:19.720]  yesterday named a person as the shooter was a completely innocent person so you have to be
[03:27:19.720 --> 03:27:25.800]  very careful with these things because again they found his social media profile and it fitted into
[03:27:25.800 --> 03:27:31.880]  who they wanted the shooter to be so they just said this guy's the shooter that's going to get them
[03:27:31.880 --> 03:27:36.360]  in hot water it's certainly dismantled their credibility to some extent so you got to be
[03:27:36.360 --> 03:27:41.560]  careful about these things but again we know nothing new york post has a headline that just
[03:27:41.560 --> 03:27:48.920]  went up last vegas gunman filmed himself during slaughter we know who filmed or he had some surveillance
[03:27:49.720 --> 03:27:54.440]  set up that allowed him to see when the police were coming now we find out last vegas madman
[03:27:54.440 --> 03:28:00.280]  steven paddock set up a camera inside his hotel room to capture his deadly shooting rampage
[03:28:00.280 --> 03:28:04.920]  and other surveillance in the hallway to alert him as cops closed in the shooter had at least
[03:28:04.920 --> 03:28:10.360]  one lens set up to tape himself as he unleashed hail on thousands of unsuspecting concert
[03:28:10.360 --> 03:28:16.840]  goers several hundred yards below his ritzy casino suite so again why would he be filming himself
[03:28:16.840 --> 03:28:21.800]  carrying out this attack knowing that he's about to die what was that for it was obviously because
[03:28:21.800 --> 03:28:28.360]  he wanted it to be discovered why did he want the footage to be discovered what is the motive we
[03:28:28.360 --> 03:28:35.160]  still don't know we'll be back it's the alex don't show live don't go away i am very proud to

[03:30:45.800 --> 03:30:51.400]  is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition
[03:30:51.400 --> 03:30:57.720]  than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting
[03:30:57.720 --> 03:31:03.880]  killing and then processing and so i set out to develop caveman but to not just have concentrated

[03:35:17.960 --> 03:35:24.920]  this horrendous tragedy in las vegas on sunday night about which we still know very little indeed
[03:35:25.880 --> 03:35:29.800]  of course today we had some photos of the guns that were in the hotel room we had of
[03:35:29.800 --> 03:35:35.320]  course the gruesome picture of the gunman himself dead reportedly from a self-inflicted
[03:35:35.320 --> 03:35:40.520]  gunshot wound before the cops arrived that's basically all we know we've got some suspicious
[03:35:40.520 --> 03:35:49.480]  financial transactions but no real motive as of this time i mean surely given the planning
[03:35:49.480 --> 03:35:54.680]  given the deadly nature of this if this wasn't someone who just went postal on a whim there
[03:35:54.680 --> 03:35:59.960]  has to be some kind of motive behind this or maybe there isn't i mean people search for
[03:35:59.960 --> 03:36:05.320]  meaning to try and cope with the horrendous tragedies like that to try and try and make some
[03:36:05.320 --> 03:36:11.800]  sense of it maybe it is completely senseless i mean that still remains a possibility remember
[03:36:11.800 --> 03:36:18.840]  the charles whitman shooting the texas ut tower shooting way back in 1966 which of course
[03:36:20.040 --> 03:36:25.480]  bears some similarities to this you know the sniper's nest from a high vantage point that
[03:36:25.480 --> 03:36:30.440]  was america's deadliest mass shooting for a very long time i think it was about 16 dead
[03:36:31.400 --> 03:36:37.240]  in the ut tower shooting charles whitman of course there was no political or religious motive
[03:36:37.240 --> 03:36:43.240]  behind that he was basically somebody with mental health problems complained of headaches i guess
[03:36:43.240 --> 03:36:48.920]  the treatments for that weren't really that sophisticated back in 1966 one day he just
[03:36:48.920 --> 03:36:55.080]  decided to kill his wife to kill his mother and then go down to the ut tower on the austin
[03:36:55.080 --> 03:37:02.120]  new university campus get up to the top and just start shooting people no real motivation he just
[03:37:02.120 --> 03:37:07.560]  had enough of life and decided to take a bunch of people along with him could that be the case
[03:37:07.560 --> 03:37:13.320]  could have been he had been inspired by charles whitman in any way again it remains to be seen
[03:37:13.320 --> 03:37:17.960]  because no information has come out despite the fact that they've now completely raided his house
[03:37:17.960 --> 03:37:23.320]  that was yesterday so obviously if there was any indication of motivation they would have seen it
[03:37:23.320 --> 03:37:29.320]  during the raid of the house you'd think virtually no social media profile i guess that's not
[03:37:29.320 --> 03:37:35.400]  out of the ordinary for somebody who's 64 years old but again we know very little this is a story
[03:37:35.400 --> 03:37:42.280]  of squawker and it's about a fourchan posting fourchan warned about vegas three weeks early
[03:37:42.280 --> 03:37:46.840]  possible financial political gain behind mass murder three weeks ago and night on
[03:37:46.840 --> 03:37:54.280]  9 11 september 11 earlier this year last month a mysterious fourchan user who went only by
[03:37:54.280 --> 03:37:59.880]  john made a series of at the time what seemed overlooked post he warned users to stay away
[03:37:59.880 --> 03:38:06.040]  from any gatherings of large groups of people in the vegas or nearby henderson area stating he had
[03:38:06.040 --> 03:38:11.080]  insider knowledge of what he referred to as a high incident project that was set to occur soon
[03:38:11.080 --> 03:38:17.640]  and again this is not extremely specific but again he did mention last vegas he did mention
[03:38:17.640 --> 03:38:23.400]  large groups of people you can go read the post he wrote i can't guarantee anything will happen
[03:38:23.400 --> 03:38:29.160]  tomorrow but last vegas is on their mind seems almost frightening now just a few weeks later
[03:38:29.160 --> 03:38:34.040]  the largest mass shooting in american history occurred at this very location so you can go
[03:38:34.040 --> 03:38:38.280]  and read those posts make your own mind that normally happens in a lot of these cases you
[03:38:38.280 --> 03:38:43.400]  know you get these vague predictions and they seem more ominous after the fact of course you get a
[03:38:43.400 --> 03:38:49.480]  lot of these predictions and nothing whatsoever happens so obviously the ones that are vaguely
[03:38:49.480 --> 03:38:54.920]  correct are going to get all the attention but again it's an interesting post nonetheless isis
[03:38:55.880 --> 03:39:02.200]  which kind of has been poo pooed over the last 24 hours is doubling down on their claim that this
[03:39:02.200 --> 03:39:08.120]  was their attack this is out of the daily mail isis releases new video bragging that last vegas
[03:39:08.120 --> 03:39:13.880]  shooting is revenge for us attacks against their caliphate islamic state has released a new video
[03:39:13.880 --> 03:39:18.200]  bragging that the last vegas massacre was revenge for us attacks against their caliphate and what
[03:39:18.200 --> 03:39:22.920]  appears to be a desperate publicity stunt the terror group claimed the horrific acts of
[03:39:22.920 --> 03:39:28.120]  steven paddock were down to them saying they radicalized him months before he shot 59 people
[03:39:28.120 --> 03:39:33.400]  dead fbi officials rubbish the claim saying he had no affiliation to any terrorist organization
[03:39:33.400 --> 03:39:39.320]  but the islamic extremists took to their propaganda news agencies to spread the word now of course
[03:39:39.320 --> 03:39:45.160]  that came out of their official news agency as the ap admitted yesterday they don't often claim
[03:39:45.160 --> 03:39:49.560]  responsibility despite a lot of people thinking they do and yeah it's happened on a couple of
[03:39:49.560 --> 03:39:55.720]  occasions but they don't always claim responsibility for attacks that aren't at least in the ap's words
[03:39:55.720 --> 03:40:03.160]  loosely linked to isis the edmonton attack in canada on sunday an isis sympathizer isis flag
[03:40:03.160 --> 03:40:09.320]  in his car tries to mow down pedestrians and please did isis claim responsibility no but they
[03:40:09.320 --> 03:40:13.320]  claim responsibility for this is it because they're losing ground on the battlefield they're getting
[03:40:13.320 --> 03:40:19.240]  desperate or they're just claiming attacks that they have nothing to do with to save face again
[03:40:19.240 --> 03:40:23.320]  it remains to be seen but they haven't backed away from it now they've released a new propaganda
[03:40:23.320 --> 03:40:30.520]  video again asserting that they had radicalized the shooter now because the big trending
[03:40:31.080 --> 03:40:36.680]  topic on twitter as well as the number one trending video on youtube overnight was jimmy kimmel
[03:40:37.560 --> 03:40:43.800]  blasting gun rights after last magus massacre but of course he has his own armed security now he
[03:40:43.800 --> 03:40:47.880]  wasn't just talking about fully automatic weapons or any of that he was basically talking about the
[03:40:47.880 --> 03:40:53.800]  entire gamut of the second amendment debate oh and by the way virtually every claim he made
[03:40:53.800 --> 03:40:58.200]  was debunked in a bright bar article which is linked from this article on info wars dot com
[03:40:59.240 --> 03:41:05.640]  so once again which he does after every political event of course he tears up he starts crying
[03:41:06.360 --> 03:41:11.880]  he trends on twitter you know the video gets two three four million views people don't actually
[03:41:11.880 --> 03:41:17.720]  look into his claims and they don't look into his hypocrisy which i did turns out that jimmy
[03:41:17.720 --> 03:41:25.640]  kimmel recently bolstered his own armed security so while he's ranting about the n r a and how
[03:41:25.640 --> 03:41:31.800]  an ordinary american shouldn't be able to exercise their second amendment rights he exercised his
[03:41:31.800 --> 03:41:38.440]  own second amendment rights more vigorously in recent weeks we have an article out of mercury
[03:41:38.440 --> 03:41:43.240]  news linked in this article recent reports confirm kimmel has beefed up his security
[03:41:43.240 --> 03:41:48.440]  due to the increasingly polarized and political nature of his rent because of course if you
[03:41:48.440 --> 03:41:53.640]  remember if you recall this guy's actually a comedian but now of course a lot of americans
[03:41:53.640 --> 03:41:58.120]  don't watch the news so they have to put the indoctrination into the comedy shows in fact that's
[03:41:58.120 --> 03:42:05.800]  the only avenue in which the left is still dominant on youtube is those late night comedy shows the
[03:42:05.800 --> 03:42:11.640]  whole sjw brigade got trounced over the past two years so that's all they have left so this is why
[03:42:11.640 --> 03:42:19.000]  youtube ensures that these videos trend week after week after week the mercury news reports about
[03:42:19.000 --> 03:42:23.720]  kimmel ever since the late night show host began crusading against the effort by president donald
[03:42:23.720 --> 03:42:29.960]  trump and congressional republicans to repeal the affordable care act that have been incidents with
[03:42:29.960 --> 03:42:36.760]  trump supporters don't actually mention what they were that forced him to increase december 23rd 1776
[03:42:36.760 --> 03:42:42.280]  these are the times that try men's souls the summer soldier and the sunshine patriot wheel in this
[03:42:42.280 --> 03:42:47.240]  crisis shrink from the service of their country but he that stands by it now deserves the love
[03:42:47.240 --> 03:42:53.320]  and thanks of man and woman tyranny like hell is not easily conquered yet we have this consolation
[03:42:53.320 --> 03:42:58.280]  with us that the heart of the conflict the more glorious the triumph what we obtain too cheap
[03:42:58.280 --> 03:43:03.800]  we esteem too lightly it is dearness only that gives everything its value heaven knows how to
[03:43:03.800 --> 03:43:09.880]  put a proper price on its goods and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom
[03:43:09.880 --> 03:43:15.400]  should not be highly rated britain with an army to enforce her tyranny has declared that she has
[03:43:15.400 --> 03:43:21.080]  a right not only to tax but to bind us in all cases whatsoever and if being bound in that
[03:43:21.080 --> 03:43:26.360]  matter is not slavery then there is no such thing as slavery upon earth even the expression is in

[03:46:40.040 --> 03:47:01.320]  live from the infowars.com studios you're listening to the alex jones show and now your host paul joseph
[03:47:01.320 --> 03:47:09.560]  whatson go back it's the fourth hour of the alex jones show took it out that article upon infowars.com
[03:47:10.440 --> 03:47:15.400]  jimmy kimmel basher's gun rights after las vegas massacre but has his own arm security
[03:47:16.120 --> 03:47:20.360]  that was pretty easy to figure out if he did indeed have arm security because there was a
[03:47:20.360 --> 03:47:27.880]  youtube clip uploaded by the jimmy kimmel live show back in 2015 if you scroll down in this this
[03:47:27.880 --> 03:47:35.080]  article infowars.com article and it shows one of his security guards they did a skit which included
[03:47:35.080 --> 03:47:40.200]  one of their security guards and you could see for a brief second his shirt lifts up and he's
[03:47:40.200 --> 03:47:47.720]  indeed packing heat he has a glock he's armed he's protecting jimmy kimmel and his staff
[03:47:47.720 --> 03:47:52.760]  and they recently beefed it there you see the image in the infowars.com article they recently
[03:47:52.760 --> 03:48:00.200]  beefed the security in response to show i think this is out the mercury news in response to these
[03:48:00.200 --> 03:48:04.680]  threats or incidents with trump supporters that they talk about the show has increased personnel
[03:48:04.680 --> 03:48:10.680]  at both the front and back entrances the personnel consists of highly trained off-duty police officers
[03:48:10.680 --> 03:48:16.360]  which judging by that image we saw there are all going to be armed so you can't have your second
[03:48:16.360 --> 03:48:21.320]  amendment rights but if jimmy kimmel needs to feel that little bit safer he can have his
[03:48:21.320 --> 03:48:26.840]  because it's the same as michael moore who built part of his career on bowling for columbine this
[03:48:26.840 --> 03:48:34.840]  anti-second amendment movie he owns guns he has armed security he admitted in a 2008 larry king
[03:48:34.840 --> 03:48:40.360]  interview michael moore that he owns guns his own security got caught violating a gun law i believe
[03:48:40.360 --> 03:48:45.960]  when he was walking through an airport with a gun back a few years ago so he can have guns he can
[03:48:45.960 --> 03:48:52.200]  have armed security because he's better than you when you don't get to exercise your rights
[03:48:52.200 --> 03:48:59.400]  because bad men do things with objects so we have to ban everything because in niece somebody with a
[03:48:59.400 --> 03:49:05.480]  truck killed 84 people even more than the las vegas massacre what was the solution to that do we
[03:49:05.480 --> 03:49:11.240]  ban trucks no because bad people are always going to find ways to kill people literally every week
[03:49:11.240 --> 03:49:16.760]  now in france there's a stabbing there's a mass stabbing in china all the time there's explosives
[03:49:16.760 --> 03:49:23.000]  use you can't get to the root of an ideology or to the root of hatred by just banning objects it
[03:49:23.000 --> 03:49:29.240]  doesn't work is this because of the polarized nature of america that we've seen since trump was
[03:49:29.240 --> 03:49:35.000]  elected was he radicalized by isis was he radicalized by cnn was there no motive whatsoever was he
[03:49:35.000 --> 03:49:40.840]  just mentally ill we don't yet know but again we have to get to the source of it without using
[03:49:40.840 --> 03:49:46.200]  it to bash other people over the head just because you know it fits into our agenda because it makes
[03:49:46.200 --> 03:49:51.480]  the other team look bad that is one aspect of it that people have tripped themselves up with over
[03:49:51.480 --> 03:49:57.480]  the past couple of days again as i mentioned earlier by identifying the wrong person as the
[03:49:57.480 --> 03:50:03.880]  shooter just so they could score political points okay it's important to get to the bottom of this
[03:50:03.880 --> 03:50:08.600]  and to find out the motive so we can try and understand it and try and stop it and if it is
[03:50:08.600 --> 03:50:14.600]  is due to increased rage and polarization either on the left or the right to try and address it and
[03:50:14.600 --> 03:50:19.960]  do something about it but don't just like pick somebody who fits your worldview and say oh this
[03:50:19.960 --> 03:50:26.120]  is the shooter because he liked racial madow on facebook no try and be accurate try and be factual
[03:50:26.120 --> 03:50:32.200]  but it's difficult because there's so so little information coming out let's cover a few other
[03:50:32.200 --> 03:50:38.120]  news stories here of course yesterday we had this bizarre story usc professor detained after breakdown
[03:50:38.120 --> 03:50:46.440]  led to active shooter scare on campus of course the day after the las vegas massacre reports of a
[03:50:46.440 --> 03:50:51.560]  shooting at usc monday afternoon were the result of confusion and alarm after a university professor
[03:50:51.560 --> 03:50:58.600]  suffered some sort of episode on campus los angeles police said according to los angeles police
[03:50:58.600 --> 03:51:04.600]  department of female faculty member had a breakdown and started yelling about an active
[03:51:04.600 --> 03:51:11.400]  shooter which caused everybody to panic the usc department of public safety said it was reported
[03:51:11.400 --> 03:51:16.680]  during class of faculty member falsely told her students there was an active shooter in the building
[03:51:16.680 --> 03:51:21.640]  and this went across the media this was on twitter active shooting in a california
[03:51:22.360 --> 03:51:27.880]  university people were freaking out it was the day after the las vegas massacre this never happened
[03:51:27.880 --> 03:51:34.840]  and some crazy professor just started shouting there was an active shooter on campus absolutely
[03:51:34.840 --> 03:51:43.240]  incredible and not what you need the day after america's deadliest mass shooting insane story
[03:51:43.960 --> 03:51:49.960]  another insane story out of france but getting noticeably less insane as it happens all the
[03:51:49.960 --> 03:51:56.840]  frigging time they actually uncovered a plot to bomb an apartment building we saw that back in
[03:51:56.840 --> 03:52:02.040]  russia in the late 90s of course where in some cases hundreds of people were killed when islamic
[03:52:02.040 --> 03:52:08.360]  terrorists tried to bomb just regular apartment buildings now it's happening in france thankfully
[03:52:08.360 --> 03:52:13.400]  they uncovered the plot the last minute the headline out of breitbart in wake of attempted
[03:52:13.400 --> 03:52:19.320]  paris bombing french government says no one is safe french interior minister giord colom has won
[03:52:19.320 --> 03:52:25.400]  no one is safe after the authorities foiled an attempted apartment bombing in paris five suspects
[03:52:25.400 --> 03:52:30.760]  have been detained after a resident in an apartment building in the seven sixteenth aron disamon
[03:52:30.760 --> 03:52:36.920]  reported suspicious activity to the police associated press reports so this is not a high
[03:52:36.920 --> 03:52:44.680]  profile target building in the center of the city it's a well-to-do upscale luxury apartment building
[03:52:44.680 --> 03:52:51.400]  on the outskirts now they're targeting those they're going after the soft targets an explosive
[03:52:51.400 --> 03:52:56.840]  device was subsequently discovered and successfully defused and counterterrorism prosecutors have
[03:52:56.840 --> 03:53:03.400]  opened an investigation colom said blowing up a building in a chic neighborhood of paris is
[03:53:03.400 --> 03:53:09.960]  this not a sign that no one is safe this doesn't happen just in suburbs in working class neighborhoods
[03:53:10.600 --> 03:53:14.200]  the interior minister had to admit one of the suspects was already subject to government
[03:53:14.200 --> 03:53:18.680]  surveillance for radicalism they always are suggesting that they had been able to participate
[03:53:18.680 --> 03:53:23.480]  in the plot undetected because such people usually have friends and networks that can
[03:53:23.480 --> 03:53:27.640]  carry out the act an assistant from people who have not displayed outward terms of radicalization
[03:53:27.640 --> 03:53:31.880]  but are ready to help the attempted bombing follows hot on the heels of deadly attack in
[03:53:31.880 --> 03:53:36.360]  marseille in which a man reported shouting alirac bar slit one woman's throat and fatally stabbed
[03:53:36.360 --> 03:53:41.400]  another at the st charles railway station which means of course we should ban knives that's
[03:53:41.400 --> 03:53:48.280]  going to solve the problem but they're now targeting apartment buildings in paris occupied
[03:53:48.280 --> 03:53:56.360]  by well-to-do residents that's how bad the problem is becoming another story out of germany
[03:53:56.360 --> 03:54:02.440]  psychiatrist warns of time bomb in germany today's migrants are not integratable a psychiatrist has
[03:54:02.440 --> 03:54:08.200]  warned germany faces a time bomb as a result of mass migration of young men who have crazy potential
[03:54:08.200 --> 03:54:15.000]  for aggression that's his quote crazy potential for aggression this is a time bomb christian peter
[03:54:15.000 --> 03:54:19.240]  doge said of their decision to open germany's borders in an appearance on the peter hawn
[03:54:19.240 --> 03:54:24.120]  talk show on zdf last month explaining the psychiatry's found people's temperament and
[03:54:24.120 --> 03:54:30.920]  personality are usually fixed by the age of 12 stating that migrants can't just be taught to
[03:54:30.920 --> 03:54:35.480]  understand our values he said classes on how to behave in germany were unlikely to have much effect
[03:54:35.480 --> 03:54:39.960]  because they have classes across europe now teaching migrants not to rape women
[03:54:39.960 --> 03:54:45.320]  hasn't had a great effect judging by the stats he said you have to accept that now of course
[03:54:46.520 --> 03:54:51.240]  what we're seeing in europe is that these migrants are becoming more radicalized the younger
[03:54:51.240 --> 03:54:58.040]  they are they're not integrating at all they're not becoming westernized they're becoming more
[03:54:58.040 --> 03:55:03.800]  islamized there's more hijabs being worn by young women i've seen it myself in france we just my
[03:55:03.800 --> 03:55:09.720]  family just moved out of there he went on on the show episode the topic of which was the power of
[03:55:09.720 --> 03:55:14.120]  fear to say that the biggest mistake politicians are making now with regards to the migrant influx
[03:55:14.120 --> 03:55:19.000]  is their response to voters concern on the issue now of course in germany engel merkel just got
[03:55:19.000 --> 03:55:28.280]  routed by the far right afd which is basically a one-topic party around immigration and what
[03:55:28.280 --> 03:55:34.360]  constitutes far right well that leads us to this story out of rt watching terrorism videos online
[03:55:34.360 --> 03:55:40.840]  could result in 15-year jail term people who watch terrorist propaganda online could face up to 15
[03:55:40.840 --> 03:55:45.080]  years behind bars home secretary amber rudd has announced in a movie designed to tighten
[03:55:45.080 --> 03:55:50.680]  laws tackling radicalization this of course is in the uk oh and by the way when they say
[03:55:50.680 --> 03:55:58.680]  terrorist propaganda they also mean far right propaganda they call me far right anyone right
[03:55:58.680 --> 03:56:05.480]  of call marks in the united kingdom is far right they call ukip which was the third biggest
[03:56:05.480 --> 03:56:11.480]  political party in the country in 2015 they call them far right so what if you watch a nigel
[03:56:11.480 --> 03:56:18.120]  forage speak you're going to be in prison for 15 years you see the slippery slope here the new law
[03:56:18.120 --> 03:56:23.160]  will extend an existing ban on downloading and storing content on a pc repeatedly watching on
[03:56:23.160 --> 03:56:32.440]  sites like youtube and they literally list far right propaganda now the definition is so subjective
[03:56:32.440 --> 03:56:37.240]  that it could literally mean anything a defense of reasonable excuse would still be available to
[03:56:37.240 --> 03:56:43.240]  academics journalists or others who may have a legitimate reason to view such material of course
[03:56:43.240 --> 03:56:47.880]  whether you're a journalist or whatever description you want to use of course that depends on what
[03:56:47.880 --> 03:56:54.600]  they think as well far right propaganda they call nigel forage far right if you watch his
[03:56:54.600 --> 03:56:59.880]  speech in front of the european parliament you're going to get arrested see how slippery those terms
[03:56:59.880 --> 03:57:06.040]  they use are that brings us to the end of the broadcast again we're keeping track of the latest
