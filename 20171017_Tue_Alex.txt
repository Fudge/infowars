[00:00.000 --> 00:05.120]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones

[00:15.040 --> 00:20.480]  well china is moving to put more troops on its border with north korea that could spark
[00:20.480 --> 00:25.120]  larger war and north korea says they're on the brink of all out nuclear war at any time
[00:25.120 --> 00:29.360]  uh we'll see if that's just more bluffing but uh the chinese saying they're going to move more
[00:29.360 --> 00:34.000]  troops in is very very serious but meanwhile here in the u.s. we're worried about not letting
[00:34.000 --> 00:39.040]  babies choose to be male or female but just saying they have no sex at birth california first
[00:39.040 --> 00:44.720]  to allow gender neutral birth certificate laws huge new russia investigation information and more
[00:44.720 --> 00:52.720]  but first the culture war calls for impeachment based on what supposed bigotry and race baiting
[00:52.720 --> 00:59.200]  as was recently spewed out on the house floor by maxine waters irrational comrade in arms
[00:59.200 --> 01:07.520]  representative al green i rise today on behalf of the many who have concluded that enough is enough
[01:08.560 --> 01:19.360]  there is one among us who seems to incite hatred bigotry and in invidious discrimination article
[01:19.360 --> 01:28.480]  one that donald john trump president of the united states of america unmindful of his high duties
[01:29.760 --> 01:39.360]  of his office and the dignity and proprieties thereof and the harmony respect and courtesies
[01:39.360 --> 01:49.600]  which ought to exhibit and be maintained in american society has under the inane pretext
[01:51.200 --> 02:00.080]  of dispensing with political correctness produced a demonstrable record of inciting white supremacy
[02:00.080 --> 02:11.200]  sexism bigotry hatred xenophobia race baiting and racism our green is one to talk back in may green
[02:11.200 --> 02:16.240]  made a big stink about a caller that sounded like he was reading off of a script threatening the
[02:16.240 --> 02:29.760]  lynch green and then green turned his rage on the american people and the president as if
[02:29.760 --> 02:37.360]  one caller represented a huge swath of public opinion you cannot hide hate you have to confront
[02:37.360 --> 02:42.960]  hate if you allow it to be hidden there will be people who will quite frankly not believe
[02:42.960 --> 02:50.720]  that the level of hate that exists is there and it's so unfortunate that many african americans
[02:50.720 --> 02:57.360]  have to live knowing that they can be threatened with lynching meanwhile steve bannon had warned
[02:57.360 --> 03:02.880]  president trump that the haters inside his cabinet would attempt to invoke the 25th amendment the
[03:02.880 --> 03:09.920]  25th amendment uses the old the president's crazy offense saying quote unable to discharge the powers
[03:09.920 --> 03:16.480]  and duties of his office end quote bannon has now given trump a 30 chance of surviving the
[03:16.480 --> 03:22.800]  presidency mclatchy reports jeffrey rosen constitution center president told cbs that it
[03:22.800 --> 03:28.320]  isn't too likely trump will be removed by his cabinet even if there is a valid medical issue
[03:28.320 --> 03:33.920]  the determination of the president's disability is really a political question rosen said so that
[03:33.920 --> 03:40.240]  means that the cabinet and the vice president decide what disabled means it's not a decision for
[03:40.240 --> 03:46.560]  doctors california representative brad sherman also filed articles of impeachment while smut king
[03:46.560 --> 03:52.560]  larry flint has taken out a full page ad in the washington post offering 10 million dollars for
[03:52.560 --> 03:58.160]  information that would impeach president trump fortune reports quote to succeed impeachment
[03:58.160 --> 04:03.440]  requires unimpeachable evidence that's why i'm making this offer buried in trump's secret tax
[04:03.440 --> 04:09.280]  returns or in other records from his far flung investments there may be a smoking gun flint
[04:09.280 --> 04:15.360]  writes in the ad did he make some financial quid pro quo with the russians has the business of the
[04:15.360 --> 04:21.120]  united states been compromised to protect the business of the trump empire we need to flush
[04:21.120 --> 04:27.200]  everything out in the open end quote rampant don keody's chasing windmills continue to plunge
[04:27.200 --> 04:33.120]  into a false narrative feeding on the promise of obama's globalist handouts that the american
[04:33.120 --> 04:40.400]  people and president trump are desperately trying to reverse the more fools like larry flint m&m the
[04:40.400 --> 04:46.640]  nfl etc pile on the more their support will diminish you want to criticize the healing of

[08:06.640 --> 08:12.560]  just like a string you can pull out of a sweater and the whole thing disintegrates the whole thing
[08:12.560 --> 08:20.400]  comes apart the situation in los vegas is an example of a 20th century corrupt deep state
[08:20.400 --> 08:28.320]  government running in to a 21st century information age we got big developments on that front huge
[08:28.320 --> 08:32.160]  developments on north korea the biggest yet giant developments on russia
[08:34.560 --> 08:40.240]  huge developments on the war on humanity the war on families the globalist biological confusion
[08:40.240 --> 08:47.840]  operation big news out of europe big news about the rhino republicans in deep trouble but before we
[08:47.840 --> 08:53.120]  hit that i have several stories here that tie into all this
[08:55.760 --> 09:00.320]  the austrian election should terrify europeans that's a cnn report
[09:02.080 --> 09:07.920]  and they raise the alarm bell here as globalists and say everywhere libertarians nationalists
[09:07.920 --> 09:13.200]  and conservatives are winning and that will stop globalism that will stop world government now now
[09:13.200 --> 09:23.680]  here's the big news they've gone from denying that there's a planetary corporate private government
[09:25.440 --> 09:31.040]  to now having to admit it in just the last year and once we have a real debate about
[09:31.840 --> 09:39.520]  a private unelected global government who as its worldview and cosmology and system
[09:39.520 --> 09:45.520]  wants to exterminate the majority of the population with population control
[09:46.560 --> 09:53.440]  dump everybody down and have who's left live under extreme austerity with the so-called elites
[09:53.440 --> 09:59.760]  being above the law and ultra-rich tax exempt no one's going to buy that and i know i've said
[09:59.760 --> 10:05.440]  this thousands of times but you're the regular listeners we've got to get that information
[10:05.440 --> 10:10.160]  out to everybody on the street so they understand that we've been proven right you've been proven
[10:10.160 --> 10:18.480]  right and that this is a new kind of war a 21st century war an information war a legal war a
[10:18.480 --> 10:26.800]  bureaucratic war a governmental war where your sovereignty and your decision making and your
[10:26.800 --> 10:33.200]  resources and your labor and your tax money is transferred into the hands of ultra-rich above
[10:33.200 --> 10:41.520]  the law globalist so they hit the alarm bell in cnn financial times of london
[10:43.440 --> 10:47.680]  atlantic monthly new yorker all the establishment fake leftist publications
[10:52.560 --> 10:57.600]  and john mccain comes out yesterday after helping keep obama care in place and trying to kill tax
[10:57.600 --> 11:00.640]  cuts and trying to get the stock market to implode they admit that's their plan
[11:00.640 --> 11:05.600]  and they're telling you that oh we shouldn't have the stock market we shouldn't have jobs
[11:05.600 --> 11:11.280]  we never have a three percent growth rate now it's 3.1 they're running around cheerleading
[11:12.240 --> 11:16.720]  the fellow reserve keeps raising rates try to kill the recovery and trump by the way just
[11:16.720 --> 11:22.480]  summoned yellen he's summoning yellen to look for her replacement he's looking at removing her
[11:22.480 --> 11:32.240]  before she serves the 10 year term hadn't even served half of it fire her that's the thing they're
[11:32.240 --> 11:36.720]  scared of the president is the only guy in government that can control the private run for
[11:36.720 --> 11:43.600]  private federal reserve under the 1913 federal reserve act beautiful if he can't get congress to
[11:43.600 --> 11:51.360]  repeal it you can sure replace who runs it at the new york fed not the dc fed not the dallas fed
[11:51.360 --> 11:59.200]  not the los angeles fed not the kansas city fed but the dc fed baby all the others are just
[11:59.200 --> 12:03.600]  satellites for processing money the federal reserve of new york's private and it sets all
[12:03.600 --> 12:14.000]  policy and it's dead in the crosshairs baby so mccain comes out says abandoning obligations of
[12:14.000 --> 12:20.240]  international leadership on half-baked nationalism as unpatriotic as any other tired dogma let me
[12:20.240 --> 12:26.160]  tell you globalism is the tired dogma globalism is the unelected system it's the thing telling
[12:26.160 --> 12:30.160]  africans they can't have cars or air conditioning it's a thing telling americans you got to be poor
[12:31.360 --> 12:35.840]  as if your prosperity or your freedom hurts the earth no that's the big corrupt elites that want
[12:35.840 --> 12:50.800]  the future for themselves so now we have mccain coming out and demonizing americanism and boy
[12:50.800 --> 12:58.480]  is he looked like he's on death star step now i don't want to see him go because his failed

[13:38.800 --> 13:45.040]  here it is abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe to refuse the obligations of
[13:45.040 --> 13:51.520]  international leadership and our duty to remain the last best hope of earth for the sake of some
[13:51.520 --> 13:59.360]  half-baked spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats and solve problems
[13:59.360 --> 14:06.400]  yeah he's got we the people behind him posing like he's an american
[14:07.600 --> 14:12.480]  he's the guy that funded al qaeda and isis he's the guy involved in every crime you can imagine

[21:17.600 --> 21:22.800]  with your host alex jones that's yours truly no insurers coming up three o'clock today central
[21:22.800 --> 21:29.760]  after this live broadcast ends with a three-hour transmission we call the war room if you just
[21:29.760 --> 21:35.680]  tuned in CNN all the major globalist publications are panicking they thought they were going to
[21:35.680 --> 21:40.880]  have a private corporate world government where they put their corporate operatives into government
[21:40.880 --> 21:45.920]  ran them for office and then had them get together and sign away authority to private
[21:45.920 --> 21:50.480]  multinational secret boards and they were going to set it up where they had diplomatic immunity
[21:51.920 --> 21:56.720]  many major international banks and brokerage firms now have diplomatic immunity not just the
[21:56.720 --> 22:04.240]  un this is the new royalty where they are a class untaxable unregulated i mean you hear
[22:04.240 --> 22:10.240]  about the un every few weeks where they'll catch some un official with little kids or women or men
[22:10.240 --> 22:17.600]  chained up as sex slaves or sometimes just slaves uh or somebody will be driving 150
[22:17.600 --> 22:23.840]  miles an hour and the cops pull them over and they say i'm a chinese diplomat in case of houston
[22:24.400 --> 22:29.600]  there's nothing you can do to me and the police have to let them go and they have diplomatic
[22:29.600 --> 22:38.080]  attest shake cases and uh bags sometimes whole plane loads they go you cannot search any of this
[22:38.080 --> 22:43.760]  this you cannot look at any of our bags doesn't matter if there's weapons in them or cocaine in
[22:43.760 --> 22:50.560]  them or heroin in them or anything else in them because we have diplomatic immunity and that's
[22:50.560 --> 22:57.920]  what globalism is a bunch of globalist megabanks big tech companies perched on top of you writing
[22:57.920 --> 23:05.440]  stuff like obama care that made their stocks go up 46 in the first year globally insurance
[23:05.440 --> 23:13.920]  companies globally on your back made 46 extra now you're wondering why they like the rhino
[23:13.920 --> 23:19.120]  republicans now you're wondering why they've got them in place coming up in the next segment i'm
[23:19.120 --> 23:24.480]  going to get into the full story on russia and look i like sean hannity i like what he's doing
[23:26.480 --> 23:30.720]  and they put out the story that they're going to break the big russia news tonight
[23:30.720 --> 23:37.360]  and what you do is when the media has ignored something you then build it up with fanfare and
[23:37.360 --> 23:43.280]  kind of relaunch it and then it gets the attention it needs i just don't engage in that behavior
[23:44.480 --> 23:50.320]  and i'm not really saying sean's doing that but the hill newspaper and others are reporting stuff
[23:50.320 --> 23:56.560]  we broke over a year ago in the middle of the campaign on this broadcast and we can show you
[23:56.560 --> 24:01.200]  the articles you can show you the videos in fact we're going to pull some of those up for you
[24:02.240 --> 24:08.000]  but it's not just us and i don't like tooting their horn for them but the new york times broke
[24:08.000 --> 24:15.920]  all this three years ago now the new york times has gotten even worse since then but the truth
[24:15.920 --> 24:22.160]  about russia has been hiding in plain view that's why hillary always came out up front
[24:22.160 --> 24:28.080]  with podesta and said trump was in bed with russia and then the only meeting they've got is his son
[24:28.080 --> 24:34.560]  meeting with a woman for 10 minutes who claims she had dirt on hillary with russia i said give the
[24:34.560 --> 24:40.720]  guy a medal so that's all they've got well when we come back the next segment i'm going to break
[24:40.720 --> 24:47.840]  down the entire story and i'm going to show you that what's in the hill is is is is already out
[24:47.840 --> 24:52.480]  there they've got a little bit more now so much saying it's a fraud and i hope sean hannity has
[24:52.480 --> 24:58.800]  100 million viewers and i said you know four million he's the top show on fox but i can't
[24:58.800 --> 25:05.280]  sit here when the media goes bannon's revolution to take down the globalist and bannon's revolution
[25:05.280 --> 25:11.920]  to defeat the rhino republicans it's our revolution it's his revolution it's matt drudge's revolution
[25:11.920 --> 25:18.160]  it's trump's revolution it's a global revolution against the globalist and the media wants to make
[25:18.160 --> 25:24.160]  it about bannon and then make something up about him or killing so they were making about me
[25:24.160 --> 25:30.480]  saying it's my revolution i'd say it wasn't so it's a trap and you notice now they're calling
[25:30.480 --> 25:35.520]  for bannon to be brought down and republicans establishment's going after him because once
[25:35.520 --> 25:42.480]  you get maneuvered into that kind of shadow president out there as they're trying to build bannon up to
[25:42.480 --> 25:47.600]  be uh then they can kill him you name it and now you've got mitch mcconnell who wouldn't even meet
[25:47.600 --> 25:55.360]  with trump a few months ago bannon goes out gets on his tail exposes him we expose him countless
[25:55.360 --> 26:02.240]  others expose the republican establishment we get roy more uh to win the primary election all these
[26:02.240 --> 26:06.560]  other establishment republicans start resigning or start losing in their special elections
[26:07.840 --> 26:13.120]  democrats are all losing in special elections in every one of them so so the power structure is on
[26:13.120 --> 26:20.240]  its knees because there's a giant global awakening a giant fourth turning a giant political
[26:20.240 --> 26:27.840]  realignment they want to make it about a steve bannon or an alex jones or a matt drudge or a
[26:27.840 --> 26:33.760]  sean hannity because those are about the four most prominent groups out there so that they can then
[26:33.760 --> 26:39.920]  target that and then demonize that group or institution to act like the whole plan was theirs
[26:39.920 --> 26:46.160]  and hopefully derail it but when the public knows it's their plan instead of the bannon revolution
[26:46.160 --> 26:52.160]  or the second american revolution when the public knows that they are the resistance you can't put
[26:52.160 --> 26:57.920]  the globalist situation back together again so i say that for strategy and bannon will tell you that
[26:57.920 --> 27:04.720]  too but let's play mitch mcconnell's at the rose garden with trump yesterday the uh leader of the
[27:04.720 --> 27:11.440]  senate the senate leader he says winners make policies and losers go home implying that oh
[27:11.440 --> 27:17.360]  he's up there making policy and that he's still there so he's a winner this lifetime politician
[27:17.360 --> 27:24.560]  instead of a maverick like bannon who's out there with you and us and everybody else organizing the
[27:24.560 --> 27:31.520]  revolution against these tyrants you've got mitch mcconnell forced back to heal forced back to trump
[27:31.520 --> 27:35.920]  to get on board you've got senator cotton saying get on board with the president or get out of the
[27:35.920 --> 27:43.200]  party it's the will of the people you got mcconnell trying to grab victory from the jaws of defeat
[27:43.200 --> 27:50.000]  acting like he's still in charge no you were an arrogant sob just a month ago now you've been
[27:50.000 --> 27:54.080]  brought back to heal because you're running scared and we shouldn't compromise with you so you can
[27:54.080 --> 27:59.840]  stab us in the back again we want you and we want paul ryan out of the party we want our country back
[27:59.840 --> 28:05.680]  get out of the way we want obama care repealed we want tax cuts and we want them now scumbag
[28:05.680 --> 28:10.640]  we want corporate tax cuts now we have the highest of the world here's mitch mcconnell you know the
[28:10.640 --> 28:21.200]  goal here is to win elections in november back in 2010 and 2012 we nominated several candidates
[28:21.200 --> 28:28.240]  the christine o'donnell sharon angle cod eggin richard murdoch uh they're not in the senate
[28:29.120 --> 28:34.080]  and the reason for that was that they were not able to appeal to a broader electorate
[28:34.080 --> 28:40.080]  in the general election uh my goal is the leader of the republican party in the senate is to keep
[28:40.080 --> 28:46.800]  us in the majority uh the way you do that is not complicated you have to nominate people who can
[28:46.800 --> 28:53.200]  actually win because winners make policy and losers go home uh that's enough that's what's
[28:53.200 --> 28:58.160]  gotten this place where you compromise no that's not what the public wants it's a political realignment

[34:18.720 --> 34:24.960]  who's pushing it the big corporate media owned by globalist and then coming up leftist harvard
[34:24.960 --> 34:29.360]  professor this is the democrats in general outlines plan to impeach trump install hillary
[34:29.360 --> 34:37.200]  as president that's on news wars dot com and info wars dot com about the intrepid steve watson
[34:39.920 --> 34:45.600]  now let's get to the rest of the story on russia gay and the reason i'm going to be cleared
[34:46.480 --> 34:51.920]  about who really broke this first and where it's not about credit it's about understanding the
[34:51.920 --> 35:06.800]  media cover-up and why hillary and others went after trump for what they themselves had done
[35:07.920 --> 35:14.640]  here's the article up on info wars dot com tick tock huge story on hillary russia set to drop
[35:14.640 --> 35:19.600]  tonight hannity teases bombshell expose i want to be clear hannity is a lot of great
[35:19.600 --> 35:23.440]  and investigative journalism has the ear of the president like no one else in media
[35:25.040 --> 35:29.840]  does a great job has a lot of courage i don't want to sit here and say this is not new news
[35:29.840 --> 35:34.320]  to put hannity down everybody should watch tonight and i hope 300 million people tune in
[35:34.960 --> 35:42.560]  instead of his customary four or five million that's the record show on cable but we broke this with
[35:42.560 --> 35:53.280]  roger stone early 2016 we hammered it we did hundreds of shows hundreds of articles to where
[35:53.280 --> 35:57.120]  i was asking roger to stop writing articles about it i said i know the russia things bull
[35:57.760 --> 36:02.160]  but but why are we obsessing on it and we're going to go over some of those articles here
[36:02.160 --> 36:08.400]  in just a moment but but you can go back to not just us because i'd love to say we broke it first
[36:08.400 --> 36:12.240]  we broke it last year during the campaign with new information but if you know who broke it all
[36:12.240 --> 36:20.320]  first 2015 the new york times now what hannity's breaking and what the hill's breaking the hill's
[36:20.320 --> 36:24.640]  gone to hannity and said they broke this the hill that spends half their time attacking yours truly
[36:24.640 --> 36:30.800]  and trump really a nasty bag of folks over there but the point is is that they know that's not
[36:30.800 --> 36:34.400]  working now they're giving up on the clinton's and now they're trying to run up underneath
[36:34.400 --> 36:42.240]  fox news and skirts but we broke all this that's not the story i have to explain that first so
[36:42.240 --> 36:47.200]  people understand that the news knew this and that's why they went along with the russian
[36:47.200 --> 36:53.280]  narrative because hillary got 30 plus million dollars the podestas did they sold out gas pipelines
[36:53.280 --> 37:03.120]  uranium weapons top components for jet fighters missiles this was been in the news for years this
[37:03.120 --> 37:08.880]  is what the clinton foundation was was a place for the chinese communist and the russians and
[37:08.880 --> 37:14.160]  the eu and anybody else that had money to come get our secrets and to get hillary a secretary
[37:14.160 --> 37:20.080]  of state to sign orders getting around congress with a little known law where she can as secretary
[37:20.080 --> 37:28.800]  of state let banned weapons and systems with a waiver transfer to that country so again this is
[37:28.800 --> 37:36.720]  all old news but now it's breaking again because there's the headline fbi uncovered russian bribery
[37:36.720 --> 37:42.800]  plot before obama administration approved controversial nuclear deal with moscow and
[37:42.800 --> 37:50.480]  that's what's important that's the big takeaway is that what we're now confirming we already had
[37:50.480 --> 37:57.760]  pieces of but it's triple confirmed we're gonna go over it in a moment obama's justice department
[37:57.760 --> 38:01.840]  with loretta lynch and the illegal tarmac meetings and all the rest of it with bill clinton
[38:03.280 --> 38:08.880]  killed the investigation not only of hillary's servers before she ever talked to comey
[38:09.680 --> 38:13.360]  and he lied to the public and said the investigation was ongoing when he'd closed it
[38:13.360 --> 38:17.280]  and she had the letters that are posted on info wars dot com today
[38:20.560 --> 38:24.800]  they killed the investigation then they had a fake investigation after what hillary knew there
[38:24.800 --> 38:35.200]  was no real investigation she partook in the farce it's simply incredible so now what's new
[38:35.200 --> 38:41.440]  more information about how the fbi was investigating the uranium deal because there was political
[38:41.440 --> 38:47.360]  pressure on it it was already open and shut and then that investigation got killed just like j
[38:47.360 --> 38:53.520]  johnson's investigation got killed along with the fbi's investigation of the servers that were
[38:53.520 --> 39:00.240]  fully wide open to not just the pakistanis but many other foreign governments and again j johnson
[39:00.240 --> 39:08.800]  said covering his own but cya that he was ordered to stop the investigation and not allowed in 20
[39:08.800 --> 39:14.960]  plus times when they tried to get into it so you're gonna hear all that tonight you heard it here
[39:14.960 --> 39:22.400]  a year and a half ago and you heard it the new york times in 2015 and that shows you how long
[39:22.400 --> 39:28.640]  this has been going on and why podesta and his brother both up to their eyeballs with the russians
[39:28.640 --> 39:35.600]  day one put the russian narrative on trump because they had to change the subject it's a classic tactic
[39:35.600 --> 39:40.320]  the good news is more and more trumps get into some control over the justice department and so the
[39:40.320 --> 39:44.560]  chickens are coming home to roost and it's a beautiful time to be alive but tick tock you now
[39:44.560 --> 39:51.440]  know what happened let's go over some of the evidence the hill today fbi uncovered russian
[39:51.440 --> 39:59.200]  bribery plot before obama administration approved controversial nuclear deal with moscow and later
[39:59.200 --> 40:05.600]  the investigation got shut down it's a big long report kickbacks pay-to-play extortion threats
[40:05.600 --> 40:09.520]  because once hillary and her people took the money the russian started putting the screws to them
[40:09.520 --> 40:13.920]  like any other government does you don't think we don't do that over there in russia under real
[40:13.920 --> 40:19.520]  day taunt that would stop and it could be stopped but the cold war never really ended here's the new
[40:19.520 --> 40:26.000]  york times just so you know okay here is uh october 17th today the hill here's the new york times
[40:26.560 --> 40:35.360]  june 21st 2017 obama winehouse knew of russia election hacking but delayed telling that's obama

[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:07.680]  british sports star should take a knee to the national anthem trying to kick off the race war
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:13.280]  in the uk after president trump attacked nfl players who joined carlin caponex refusal to
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:17.840]  stand no they attacked him for saying it was wrong he sparked a wave of protest he had his free
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:24.080]  speech stress that they are not protesting either the and now the nfl's losing most its money going

[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:37.600]  deeply engraved that it is part of the dna of the nation oh britain is no different the police may
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:43.760]  not kill as many black people but is that only because they do not routinely carry gone statistically
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:48.000]  in the quality the rarest way for a black person who dies by cop education and wealth
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  that plagues african americans is strongly felt by black people in britain all of this
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.120]  no liberalism plagues black people direct legacy of the british empire that often made its place in
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:05.120]  the world through genocide slavery uh britain was the first country to ban slavery everybody
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:10.000]  else did it but you you hope folks don't know that people are yearning to roll back the clock to
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.440]  when britain you roll back the clock rather than draping themselves in now bringing in
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:19.040]  third world populations and then teaching them to hate everybody that's rolling back the clock
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:27.360]  should take a knee or clench a fist the flag is not a symbol of pride but oppression an anthem
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:34.560]  praising the monarch is not unifying but divisive a nation that will not deal with the realities of
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:39.040]  its racism is not one that the children of the college and why do you want to come into the
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:45.280]  country so bad if it's so bad never again will i stand never again like it's the nazis all right

[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:54.080]  to the other delicate genius pushing race baiting and everything the trans because you know we can't
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:58.400]  have mothers and fathers we can't have sexes we got to confuse everything and then weaponize it
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:05.840]  here is burgand dork uh up there telling you that england is pure evil from britain no doubt it's a
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:10.640]  country that likes to think of itself as inclusive but that depends where you're standing but there's
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:17.120]  never a good enough do as i say i run your life me as a transgender mixed race person we live in a
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:23.200]  deeply racist society yes and i'm your boss i will tell you what's good and what's bad the
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:28.080]  government's race audit for england identified discrimination against people of color in many
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:32.240]  of our institutions ranging from and if you go to most areas of africa blacks will hack you up
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:37.600]  with machetes does this surprise you it's old news to me and almost a bad joke to identify now
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:43.680]  it's something that we've known for years but the political will have to deal with it now we've
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:50.720]  got to make you guilty and beat you over the head why should we expect anything else from a country
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:55.360]  that's built its success on the enslavement of non-white megabanks taking everybody over they're
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:00.160]  conquering everybody right now the corporate borgs here taking over it wants us to fight with each
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:06.480]  other this is what's happening for being colonialized by globalism for being totally enslaved
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:11.440]  and anything was good before is being removed and people like me who call out racism would be listened
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:18.160]  to call out racism or threatened hey you are your force fed by state-run media that wants to totally
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:23.600]  conquer the people improvement for people of color they need to understand that racism is not learned
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:29.200]  oh see only improve her people of color racism or unconsciously passed down through privilege
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:34.800]  the uncomfortable truth is that the white race is the most violent and oppressive force of nature
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:40.320]  oh my gosh whites are inherently evil total complete racism did you just hear what that
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:46.240]  lady said or that man or that perp that creature you literally just said whites are the most

[01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:01.360]  bio but i wanted to get her on to get into the state of the economy the federal reserve
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:10.160]  trump summoning yellen to reportedly try to find her replacement and now of course we have
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:15.360]  trump saying they're not going to loot fanny may and freddy mack to fund obama care something that
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:21.360]  catherine austin fitz has talked a lot about catherine is the president of salari ink uh

[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:16.960]  but she wants to get into something even bigger than what's happened at fanny may and freddy mack
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:24.480]  21 trillion missing from u.s accounts at doj a department of defense and hud and that's even
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:29.120]  mainstream news but just back at the paper con con how they want a constitutional convention
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:34.000]  uh the dangers of a constitutional convention will cover that with her in the shower and take
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.600]  some of your phone calls towards the end of the hour as well but wow uh what a time to be alive
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:45.600]  catherine alexa can't believe it i'm talking to you believe it or not from washington dc a place
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:51.840]  i never come so i'm right in the center of mortar where all the money is going missing
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:57.680]  well let's talk about that because the what two days before 911 it was reported that two
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:03.200]  plus trillion was missing cbs reported it from the pentagon then it was four plus trillion later
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:10.000]  and then now the numbers i'm seeing all combined uh we're talking about 20 plus trillion well actually
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.200]  alex coming into 911 it was four trillion and i was working with a great investigator
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:21.360]  reporter here in washington it was about to break a huge story um in in a magazine that gets delivered
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:29.200]  to all the congressional and senate offices on september 15th and uh and it was it was last work
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:34.560]  with her editor the weekend before and then that monday when rumsel came out and did his sort of
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:39.920]  limited hangout of the 2.3 trillion i made the mistake of saying to her nothing can stop this
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:45.120]  story from going mainstream now and of course the next day was 911 and so it got buried but
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:52.320]  um what has happened and it started in fiscal 1998 the federal government has been in very
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:57.600]  significant violation of the laws related to its finances both constitution and financial
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:02.880]  management laws and one of the symptoms of this is that every year there are significant
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:08.400]  un what's called undocumented adjustments so it's transactions that aren't approved in
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:13.200]  appropriation or you can't prove or approved in appropriation and are not transparent as they're
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:21.040]  required to be um and it's been going on for literally since 1998 but then in 2015 department
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:28.880]  of defense uh reported 6.5 trillion undocumented adjustments which is 10 times its budget um and
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:36.080]  then had almost i think 300 billion again many multiples of its its budget and it's a normal
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:41.600]  in an accounting operation to have some small percentage of undocumented adjustments it wouldn't
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:47.280]  be considered material but this is the equivalent um you know the the work was finally audited and
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:53.680]  documented by dr mark skidmore from michigan state university and we finally loaded up on
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:59.360]  my website if you go to missing dot salary dot com we loaded up all the government documents for
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:05.440]  every year for both hud and d and d because what happened was dr skidmore who's a full professor
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:10.720]  of state local government heard me talking about the 6.5 trillion and he said you know that has to
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:15.120]  be wrong i'm going to prove it wrong and so he dug into the documents and then he called me and he
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:22.320]  said oh my god you're right how can this be um and so this is very significant for two reasons one
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:28.160]  is it's a tremendous amount of money 65 000 per person and when you have the the president in
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:33.120]  congress saying we don't have enough money for health care or this or that you know i beg to
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:39.520]  differ if if we weren't disappearing 65 000 per person we would that's number one but the other
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:45.600]  thing is when we're going to discuss significant changes in the budget you know a great deal is
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:50.800]  being made out to make the general population profit get wrong and they should take responsibility
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:55.520]  for this that's the danger of a but about balance sure exactly well let's get into that the next
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:13:00.160]  segment and ask you know how we fix it but but i want to ask now we always hear about the 20 trillion
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:05.600]  dollar deficit but that's only what's currently uh owed on the books explain to folks because if
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:11.200]  they're new listeners this was in cbs news abc news back when it was two trillion then four trillion
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:16.000]  then six trillion then ten trillion i mean you see it occasionally but it's like this whole other
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.600]  giant thing that's hardly discussed it's not denied explain to people what it is and where you think
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:30.560]  it's going well what it is is uh imagine if you got a report from your bank that you had a thousand
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:36.080]  dollars less in your bank account then you showed in your checking account register and instead of
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:41.680]  figuring out what went wrong you know did did money not get deposited as money disappearing
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:47.680]  you just wrote an item that's an undocumented adjustment and now they balanced so the way
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:52.160]  the government has balanced the books at the end of every year is to just write these undocumented
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:58.640]  adjustments which i would say is illegal you can't be spending money that you can't document is in
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:04.720]  compliance you know has been approved by congress is appropriated under the variety of mechanisms so
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:09.120]  you know this is basically illegal if a company did it the stock exchange would shut them down
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:14.560]  investors would shut them down the problem is the federal government can continue to sell bonds in
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:19.920]  the markets whether they're in compliance with the laws related to their finances the new york
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:26.960]  fed member banks are executing these transactions it means that the banks and the contractors
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:32.800]  who run the payment systems are affecting illegal transactions and congress is tolerating that and
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:37.200]  here's the reality crime that pays is crime that stays if we want to stop the corruption
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:44.160]  then we need the money to be run according to the law and that's why this is the 800 pound gorilla
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:52.560]  in the room i've seen rumfeld asked us uh in congress before by synthy mckinney back when
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:57.840]  she was there and he didn't even deny the trillions are missing i mean it's it so so again where is
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:06.320]  it going well that's the that's the question and um you know there are many possibilities and i i
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:13.920]  think some of it is clearly going for black budget operations but i will tell you from from 1995 to
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:24.160]  1995 the fortune 500 revenues tracked with the gmp and then suddenly starting in 1996 with it with
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:32.480]  globalization they exploded they exploded and and grew much faster and i think a lot of that is coming
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:37.280]  out from government money so let's talk about that exactly just like china admittedly props up their
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:43.040]  stock market the globalists are using american black money to basically manipulate markets worldwide
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:48.720]  and then siphon even more off for black budget breakaway civilization projects uh that make the

[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:33.520]  catherine austin fitz is a consummate insider who's worked the highest levels of the clinton
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:38.960]  administration and others inside hud and the information that she's been breaking in the last
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:44.720]  almost 20 years since she went public has been the heart of much of what we know about the whole
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:52.000]  shadow global finance and economic system worldwide there's over 21 trillion dollars missing
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:58.640]  outside of the 20 trillion national debt that's 41 plus trillion not to mention all the obligations
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:05.440]  it's what's really going on where is the money going well it turns out it's just like communist
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:10.880]  china crops up manipulates their stock market the same thing is happening now but for special
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:17.600]  interest and what's trump's big crime he's actually directing some of that largesse back
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:23.600]  towards the people and turning the economy back on that's made him big enemies of the globalist
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:27.840]  because they want to use the control to consolidate power and have austerity for us
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:33.360]  while they live like kings but a bigger question is if trump is successful talking to this great
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:41.120]  researcher and economist is what he's doing tenable long term if he doesn't get the tax cuts
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:47.120]  and then doesn't cut the spending and how could he ever shut down this private corporate looting
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:52.880]  of the treasury no wonder they hate him so much so we'll get her take on is trump a good guy
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:58.160]  or a bad guy and why is the establishment so mad at him kathryn austin fits please continue
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:04.800]  well trump is in the sort of in the middle of this term because if you look at his first three
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:10.720]  months in office he was very much about moving power back to local areas and the make america
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:17.760]  great again plan alex the challenge is from april first on he's done a turn and there's a lot more
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:25.360]  or there's a lot more about using the military and expense appropriate i mean uh defense appropriations
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:31.520]  to keep the stock market used so he's trying to serve both masters and of course goldman sacks
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:36.640]  and the goldman sacks guys are right in the heart of it now trump's answer for this is
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:42.960]  let me get financial reform and tax reform and then everybody wins so he's trying to to switch it
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:48.960]  uh you know not as much in the military into both but he's trying to serve both masters
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:53.360]  i don't think you can do both so but but are you saying his heart's in the right place
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:23:00.320]  well i think i think if you look at many of this different policies he's trying to do make america
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:05.440]  great again but it falls down in the budget i don't think he sees now a way to politically
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:12.240]  switch the money you know out of the central backing warfare model and he's he's playing
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:18.720]  let's be clear let's be clear because goldman sacks made what 37 percent more just this year
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:24.320]  they ever made before record profits but still they're waging war because they want the control
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:28.720]  for themselves they don't want a bigger economy for everybody they want to have the only economy
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:33.680]  correct because you've written a lot about that so why are they so enraged in him despite the fact
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:39.920]  that he's forced them to change policies and it's only made him richer well but here's a thing well
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:44.080]  they're not enraged with him i mean it was goldman sacks was instrumental in getting trump elected
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:52.080]  so uh you know i think you have very significant corporate interests on both sides of that election
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:57.040]  and trump's trying to walk a very delicate line because if you listen to him in manouche and he's
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:02.560]  taking the position that the stock market is his metric and the reality is the stock market is
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:10.000]  deeply deeply dependent on the military absolutely but but let me break this down but if he doesn't
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:14.640]  prop that up it all goes we know it's parasitic we know it stays we know it's got big problems
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:18.560]  but still it's how most companies that employed people operate and i know you're the expert on
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:23.440]  this but let me get this they gave a hundred to one at goldman sacks the money to hillary i'm not
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:28.080]  disagreeing that once he got in he brought some of them in to carry out his operations i mean
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:31.920]  that's what he's got to do but i mean how are you are you saying goldman sacks was really behind trump
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:40.000]  alex if you look as soon as the the weiner laptop uh the fbi got court permission to use the weiner
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:46.560]  laptop so that week before goldman sacks and booze allen started trading up dramatically so a trump
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:53.120]  election traded uh you know a week before so i think goldman sacks you know usually the investment
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:59.680]  banks are on both sides you know in these campaigns but if you if you certainly see putting in koan
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:05.440]  and putting in manouche and uh i would say that goldman sacks was at least on both sides well
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:08.480]  you're gonna have plenty of time to break this down on the next segment i really respect your
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:13.520]  view and research on this katherine austin fits of salari.com's our guest that let me put it to you
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:18.640]  this way mainstream media the corporate culture the foreign governments the pope the e you the
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:24.400]  communist chinese i mean they are in a frothing war against trump from my research it's a real war
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:30.160]  i know he tried to bring in the establishment and compromise them for america get them you know to
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:35.040]  come in and say hey you know the water's fine come on in so i see him trying to co-op them
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:39.840]  so the other way around but still there's a frothing hatred of him or is that is that just
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:44.960]  show there are two things going on there's tension in the deep state between the people who want to
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:50.800]  make sure north america is fine versus the people who really want to sacrifice north america to do
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:56.400]  the global empire there you go you are so smart that's it he has a soft spot for america that they
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:01.520]  see as mentally ill they see us as lazy and dumb he wants to keep america dominant and that's his
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:07.840]  crime no but i think you have a lot of very capable people in the military and intelligence
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:14.240]  who understand that the bankers model is overstretched and in danger and and as risk managers
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:20.000]  they say we we've got to re ground back into north america so i don't i don't i think that
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.720]  there's a portion of the deep state who i would say is more conservative and wiser than the group
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:30.240]  back in clinton so i don't think this was the deep state against populism i think this is
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:35.520]  two different factions in the deep state and and part of the challenges you know i'll be tough
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:40.160]  trump is under tremendous pressure not to do the make america great plan he's under
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:46.000]  tremendous pressure to do you know make a israel great plan and there's a real tension there and
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.280]  part of it is the stock market again is very dependent on military activities i mean i i
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:55.920]  don't think trump really ended up planning on being an arm salesman for a dollar a year
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:01.680]  but that's part of what happened and so the for all of us what we need to do is how do we get
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:07.680]  what is healthy for counties and states in america to be good for the stock market and the
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:13.120]  stock market to be good for us on the ground because we've been through a process of securitizing
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:18.720]  more and more of the economy into the stock market in a way that's hurting the basic economy we're
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:24.160]  propping it up with government money so i you you mentioned very rightly we have 20 trillion
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:28.960]  dollars of debt well if i issue government bonds and then suck that money through the government
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:34.560]  budget and use it to make corporations wealthier in a way that's not good for the general economy
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:40.560]  we end up where exactly where we've ended up right now all right i i got a lot of my questions in
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:44.320]  there because i know what your views are on this and i know they're accurate and i wanted you in
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:49.120]  your own words to lay that out but that's really it there's another deep state that isn't out to get
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:54.800]  america it realizes that uh we're the heart of the renaissance we need to be rebuilt not sold out
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:59.760]  on the ultra globalism they're not even against the you know the empire and you know total globalism
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:06.720]  and the rest of it they're just not this sycophantic pro china pro kind of communist angle and i know
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:12.240]  you also trained in china uh that that somehow sees america as an adversary whereas we have
[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:17.520]  elites saying why should we kill the golden goose is that a good way to say it yeah so so think of
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:22.320]  it this way you have a group in the deep state who i think would like to optimize the wealth and
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:29.440]  well-being of 325 million americans as opposed to take silicon valley re-engineer labor out of
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:34.160]  everything and make a few people rich and just say the rest are expendable stay right there
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:38.240]  because that what you just said is the absolute key to everything if you want to see all the fake
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:46.560]  liberals the drooling wicked tech owners they are the most ruthless slave factory owning uh post human
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:51.040]  type folks and they say they're liberal all day is their political cover i'd say katharine
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:57.440]  awson fitz is a real liberal we'll hear from her on the other side stay with us the answer to being

[01:33:54.160 --> 01:34:00.400]  it's now 21 trillion plus going into this deep state apparatus but when i talk about
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:05.040]  how you couldn't be getting more important information did you just hear her if you just
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:09.040]  joined us i'm gonna get her to now recap it because i was jumping in a lot because it's so
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:16.240]  important trump simply wants america to be prosperous as a command base for this major system
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:21.280]  the globalists have decided to absolutely exploit people what they call a breakaway
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:27.360]  civilization replace us with robots to make us obsolete as bill joy the co-owner co-owner
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:34.320]  of sun microsystems said in 1999 18 years ago in wired magazine he went to a conference of 200
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:40.560]  plus tech owners they unanimously agreed to begin phasing people out but first get them hooked up
[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:45.840]  to virtual reality get them so unhealthy and so drugged out that they sign waiver forms
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:51.840]  to basically be drugged to death after that now this all sounds insane this is the admitted plan
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:58.080]  and all the virtual reality shows that are coming out in movies and uh you know player one ready
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:03.280]  all this stuff is their admitted plan not my opinion that's why the credibility of this broadcast
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:08.240]  goes up and up not that i'm that smart i have the experts on i read the globalist documents
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:12.640]  i'm aware of their plan here comes trump saying we're going to build a world for humans we're
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:16.720]  going to release the secrets of the universe that they have already have found many of we're
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:22.320]  going to deploy the technology to new development the globalists are like no you're not the tech
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:29.040]  giants pose as liberals and have the bbc churning out that europe's evil and families are evil and
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:34.000]  all the rest of it to make us fight with each other in the final phase of the takeover go
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:38.640]  ask somebody is donald trump on factories with suicide nets around them no apple does donald
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:43.920]  trump make his people package more than 200 packages an hour 200 boxes an hour until their
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:50.000]  hands are bleeding uh at at uh his factories no it's amazon does amazon own its own apartment
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.800]  buildings 300 square foot coffin apartments 200 square foot and charge you more per square foot
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:58.880]  than anybody else has ever been charged but makes you basically live there to work for them
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:06.560]  in a in a sharecropper situation yes ladies and gentlemen the truth is they're cold blooded sickos
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:12.560]  but they pose as liberals as their political cover because traditionally it was liberals
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:17.040]  that were against child labor it was liberals that were against slave labor they've taken over
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:22.400]  the global liberal movement with neo-liberalism so catherine oston fits you've got the floor recap
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:27.280]  what you've said lay out these facts for people so they understand what we're facing and then you
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:34.880]  talk about the shadow global corporate system where the 21 trillion is gone so so alex a process
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:39.600]  started 20 years ago it's what i call the financial coup d'etat at the same time the money went missing
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:45.840]  what we've done is government has laundered or through the governmental mechanism we have
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:52.640]  laundered tremendous amounts of technology and tremendous subsidized low capital into the tech
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:58.560]  industry including silicon valley and and what we've done is we've made it nearly impossible for
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:05.840]  small business to access competitive in the market cost of capital a lot has been done to make sure
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:11.600]  this technology and capital didn't get to small business they use taxpayer money to finance a
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:18.480]  breakaway corporate civilization well you've used you've used taxpayer money to finance a breakaway
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:23.600]  civilization through the black budget whether it was the the securities fraud that ended up in the
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:29.120]  bailouts or the missing money but what you've also done is you've laundered you you've made it possible
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:34.560]  to pay corporations large amounts of money on government contract they invent the most powerful
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:40.160]  black budget technology and you let them own that or you laundered into silicon valley and so when
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:45.360]  you talk to the tech billionaires which i have they will literally say well we can replace all
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:50.880]  humans with ai and software and what they don't understand is that they are massively subsidized
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:55.760]  by the government they really don't understand it they're just living in their little bubble
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:59.440]  and what they don't understand is as soon as they achieve that you know they'll be thrown
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:06.160]  overboard too so so the reality is we've got to put small business back in the game and we've
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:11.600]  got to put municipalities back in the game so that this technology really helps humans and
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:16.480]  makes a difference to the real economy because centralizing the economy shrinks the pie and
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:23.520]  that is the sorts of inequality it's basically the ability of selected players to operate consistently
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:28.960]  outside the law financed with government money the ultimate discrimination the ultimate discrimination
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:32.800]  and then they admit in their white papers they distract us with all this culture war
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:38.400]  and fake stuff and we should all be unified about equal access to the market transparency
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:44.640]  and having tax money used to build a platform for all of us not for a bunch of spoiled rotten
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:50.240]  want to be transhumanist power tripping jeff bezos and mark zuckerbergs that call their users
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:58.080]  dumb efforts well you know i haven't seen bezos do that but but the reality is what we need is a
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:02.720]  process where we go back to markets in other words we haven't had markets in this country for decades
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:13.040]  yeah zucker i call him faceberg but yeah so so the reality is we need to get back to markets and
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:18.960]  the problem you have is you've got to win lose relationship now between information technology
[01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:23.840]  systems and the financial system and people in places you've got to get that back into a win
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:28.400]  win because we don't need to win lose the other way we don't need to help people and then have
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:33.760]  the stock market crash and the money not make sense so you've got a governance structure that has
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:39.120]  no integrity you've got a information systems that have no integrity in a financial system that
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:43.840]  has lost a great deal of integrity and what we're all talking about is how do you bring
[01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:49.040]  integrity and what i'm saying is if you finance criminals doing criminal things that are killing
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:54.480]  you you've got to cut off their money and that's why i keep talking about enforcing the constitution
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:59.200]  and holding the government accountable because if you shut off that secret money you know that's
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:04.720]  being taken illegally um you have a way of turning this around because you have one group of players
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:10.640]  who are operating outside the law financed with our money and whether it's the breakaways or the
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:15.200]  money rolling into silicon valley you've got to you've got to address that which is why i keep
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:20.960]  coming back to enforce the constitution enforce the constitution there's an effort instead of
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:26.640]  enforcing the constitution to change it which i believe will basically tear up the constitution
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:30.080]  and that's what they have to do to keep all the money that they've stolen through the financial
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:34.960]  coup d'etat whether it was the money in the bailout or the missing money or god knows what money is
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:41.440]  disappearing you know within the 30 miles around me as we talk you're right there in dc and that's
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:45.600]  why they're so arrogant it's why they're so uh angry and and that's why they want to destroy
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:51.760]  trump because he just has the idea of let's think humans have a future let's make humans valuable
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:56.320]  but really all they're trying to do is teach us that we're dehumanized and that we're bad so we
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:41:02.880]  have no life force so we have no survival instinct so we just give up well remember you've got in
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:06.800]  these different groups you've got basically the east coast and the west coast you see you've got
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:13.600]  dc wall street silicon valley and hollywood and when you talk with people in these groups
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:18.640]  they really don't know they see the bubble that they're in but they don't see the whole picture
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:23.680]  so you'd be amazed how many people who are in this thing you know who could go in a different
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:28.240]  direction if they had an honest map which is why it's so important what you're doing with infowars
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:32.640]  you're trying to give them an honest map um but i will tell you there are a lot of people in the
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:37.920]  system who really don't see the big picture a lot who are just going with the flow and i hate to say
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:43.920]  this alex the corruption around this in the general population is significant it's not absolutely
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:48.560]  we deserve what's happening to us we have created the atmosphere and the climate to allow this to
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:53.840]  happen salari dot com katherine austin fits one of the smartest people out there this is really
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:58.000]  just an emergency transmission to humanity i don't want to just live for today i want to live for
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:03.120]  my children and grandchildren i see how far humanities come all the things we've done together
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:07.840]  and people ask why am i so excited why do i have so much energy it's because when you realize that
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:12.000]  there are a few psychopaths on top who do know what's going on and think they're going to fight
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:17.040]  over who has the final ai control just as katherine said you realize what the stakes are we got to go
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:21.360]  to break we come right back to katherine she's going to get to this big point she's got and then
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:26.080]  she's going to talk about more solutions and like she said constitution bill of rights bring back
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:31.680]  transparency but the bigger thing she talked about is waking people up getting people involved
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:38.160]  letting people know they have value to expose this program that is such a fraud we'll be right back

[01:46:56.240 --> 01:47:16.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:38.480]  the
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:43.200]  ladies and gentlemen people ask why i get so excited
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:49.280]  why i'm jumping in over my guest why i'm so concerned because i've read hundreds and hundreds
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:55.120]  and hundreds of white papers 20 years ago that i've listed and named many of them here today
[01:47:55.120 --> 01:48:01.840]  where the top tech companies charted the future of humanity and there is no humanity in that
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:09.040]  future the ultimate anti-human racism the ultimate elitism saying they're going to transcend humanity
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:15.280]  with government finance DARPA programs and the common mind of the people building their
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:22.720]  breakaway civilization that is designed to make people poor and stupid so they can be basically
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:31.120]  phased out saving the earth from an infestation of humans that's all this is it's like an alien force
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:36.880]  came and did it but it's our own species with psychopaths and sociopaths and control freaks
[01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:42.720]  and control the only thing i disagree with katherine austin fitz who's a big insider on all of this is
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:46.640]  she says a lot of them aren't conscious and don't know what they're doing they just see
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:51.360]  their own bubbles and their own power grabs but when you read a lot of their own admissions they
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:58.640]  see where it's going and there is a mad race not an arms race but a god race as ray Kurzweil said
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:04.800]  the top futurist at google i don't believe in god yet they know what they're doing they know how
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:11.360]  dangerous it is but they're mad lust for power it's like robber baron meets mad scientist
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:16.160]  they're willing to do anything katherine austin fitz other points you'd like to make on that subject
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:21.600]  solutions where you see the trump revolution going other populist revolutions i mean it's
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:27.200]  negative if some things are there is a global human awakening to the centralization of power
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:32.480]  to mainstream media and to hollywood to the nfl it seems to all be in massive decline
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:38.960]  so let me tell you the good news the good news is if you look at the government flows whether it's
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:44.800]  the credit the money going missing the budget the reality alex is if we run the government budget
[01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:51.520]  to prop up the stock market without thought to what's best for the economy then you get a centralization
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:56.560]  of wealth but you shrink the pie from what it could be and the reality is if we turn it around
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:02.080]  and create a win-win relationship between people and places in the stock market we can get a much
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:06.720]  bigger pie which is what we need to do we need to expand wealth the problem with this model is
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:13.520]  it shrinking it you know down into a few hands and so the good news is it's possible there's no
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:19.920]  economic reason why we can what it what it requires is a really major turn in the economy now
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:25.040]  i posted up on my website notes to support this i've got a wonderful piece called how to enforce
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:30.240]  the constitution because what you need for the economy to work is you need law what what we've
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:36.240]  got is lawlessness and corruption we need law so the question is how does each one of us working
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:41.760]  in our own lives get that well there are a number of things you can do the banks that are transacting
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:48.080]  the 21 trillion of illegal transactions you know if we all stop banking at those banks and moved
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:53.840]  instead to an honest and ethical local credit union or community bank is one thing we can all do the
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:59.120]  second thing we can do is we can work with our state legislators to make sure we don't approve
[01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:04.800]  the state call for con cons or if your state is approved to get it repealed and then the third thing
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:10.720]  is in the list that i posted at salari.com there are lots of ideas of how we can enforce the
[01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:16.000]  constitution and of course everybody's different but if each one of us and here's the other good
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:21.680]  news alex it doesn't take everybody if five to ten percent of the people who want to act it can
[01:51:21.680 --> 01:51:26.960]  make a huge difference particularly if more are just willing to move their bank you know one of the
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:33.200]  reasons that people go along with this is they watch the general population supporting the criminals
[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:38.160]  i mean again and again and again you and i have both experienced the extent to which the general
[01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:43.680]  population will put their money in their banks turn on their media put their advertising dollar
[01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:49.680]  in their media buy from them if if we will just shift it's the safest thing in the world to do
[01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:57.120]  just shift the money um ellen shateman the attorney who wrote jp uh made off about morgan's jp
[01:51:57.120 --> 01:52:03.920]  morgan's complicity and made off um estimated in her bag that directly or indirectly 50 percent
[01:52:03.920 --> 01:52:11.440]  of americans bank at jp morgan chase why imagine tomorrow if everyone shifted their money it would
[01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:15.360]  it would ring huge bells in wall street in washington they'd come to their knees and they'd
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:20.720]  start changing and so you're talking about we have the ballot box the grand jury box the cartridge
[01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:26.720]  box uh the soap box but we've also got voting with our dollars with our feet look at hollywood
[01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:31.840]  look at the nfl that power is the greatest power it's why the elites want to get rid of the free
[01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:36.720]  market system they want to use it to get control a limited free market a crony system but once
[01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:40.960]  they've gotten control they want to pull up the levers they want to get rid of competition
[01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:45.920]  because they know that people can turn against them and it's beginning to happen you're absolutely
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:52.400]  right you you did a fabulous interview with aron russo which i always i keep republishing on my
[01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:57.600]  website i use it in presentations where aron explained to you the bankers goal is to chip
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:03.360]  everybody it's the mark of the beast and now with the rollout of cryptocurrencies that's exactly
[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:07.200]  what they're you know they're getting all the freedom fighters to prototype their control system
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:12.160]  and china is effectively brought in a cash flow system sweden's making you get a chip to get on
[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:18.480]  trains it's here right it's here and so you know the thing i try and communicate yes i've worked
[01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:23.840]  at the top of washington yes i've worked at the top of wall street these folks believe in slavery
[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:29.200]  one of the reasons the african-american slave trade was cancelled was the bankers had no way
[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:35.440]  to perfect collateral digital technology changes that and the reason i keep hammering on now is
[01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:42.480]  the time we've got to do it now if we don't get the turn in the next one to five years the reality
[01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:49.280]  is where they want to go is replace all the humans with ai and software chip us all and there you
[01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:55.200]  are it's slavery it's that you know if it goes the wrong direction it's that bad we have nothing
[01:53:55.200 --> 01:54:00.880]  to lose by acting whatever risk you have to take boy is it worth it and even if someone's not a
[01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:06.560]  christian you can look at how they're using it as an archetype the revelation daniel all of it
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:12.400]  as a total control system so even if you don't believe uh you know that this is real they're
[01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:17.120]  constructing it they're using it as a blueprint so they're manifesting it and making it real
[01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:22.720]  right but it's it's you have to understand they're not only looking to control you physically
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:27.600]  they're looking to literally control your mind you're talking about implementing a system that
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:34.720]  can deliver and does deliver entrainment technology subliminal programming i mean imagine another 20
[01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:40.640]  years of more aggressive technologies we know that they have you know literally technology
[01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:44.960]  that can place thoughts into your head oh yeah the smartphones are programming people the flicker

[02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:17.600]  to you live from the front lines of the info war i told you earlier this year back in march that
[02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:22.240]  megan kelly would destroy herself coming here to do her hit piece because i knew she was politically
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:29.440]  already the walking dead now even cnn the dead reporting on the dead the discredited reporting
[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:36.240]  on the discredited the fake reporting on the frauds is now talking about nbc's megan kelly problem
[02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:41.920]  no megan kelly's problem was going head up against the populist champion donald trump
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:48.560]  and then she thought she'd take on the mad tea party prophet himself out of the wilderness that's
[02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:52.640]  what time magazine and newsweek call me that's what they call me in the annals the democratic party
[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:57.920]  he is the tea party prophet i am very proud to be the crazy prophet out in the wilderness telling
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:03.120]  you this was coming in fact that's basically what i've seen my mission has been is to take
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:09.920]  bullets to take the stabbings to take the political drive-by attacks and to get the people awake and
[02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:16.240]  aware of what's going on so here she is earlier this year back when she was the great mighty
[02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:22.400]  megan kelly saying she wouldn't come on and coast with me because i couldn't afford her well lady
[02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:28.240]  the truth is they're about to cancel your contract you you don't hunt you don't fly you understand
[02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:33.440]  here she is that's actually the drudge chair right there so if she wanted we wanted to give her a
[02:01:33.440 --> 02:01:38.960]  microphone she'd actually co-host from the shadows and actually copy matt drudge i don't think megan
[02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:44.720]  kelly can help it can can i can't afford you i know we hey we're of the people we don't have a
[02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:50.320]  lot of money around here we're just here and i'm serious we're just here in texas uh and you know
[02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:57.440]  we are just small time little guys here we're not the big mighty nbc uh seriously though uh we
[02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:01.280]  should hand her a microphone somebody hand her a microphone on the remote just just in case she
[02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:11.280]  wants it okay i'm gonna stop and now here's the cnn piece you know it wasn't long ago when megan
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:16.960]  kelly seemed to have the media world on a string in 12 years at fox news and he used her as a darling
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:21.920]  to launch your assault he betrayed her as her contract with fox news neared its end
[02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:27.440]  kelly was one of the most she got sucked in by being the darling after more than a dozen years
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:33.920]  just like the nfl i have decided to pursue a new challenge hit pause ultimately i mean the story
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:42.800]  here is that she got lured by being on cobert and being on good morning america and being a superstar
[02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:48.560]  the big failed globalist media tricked her from being a teleprompter reading fake conservative
[02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:54.000]  into being what she really was and then it destroyed her she told america i hate you
[02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:59.120]  i hate trump i hate the second amendment i'm an elitist i want to be accepted by the
[02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:05.760]  manhattan establishment and america said good we're not gonna watch you and without us you are
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:13.600]  nothing so let's let's start it back over because this is just too rich here it is you know what
[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:19.200]  i'm sorry sorry sorry they've now moved from good-looking teleprompter readers to ironic ones
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:24.320]  thinking their nerd audience will think this is less threatening and cool and maybe he looks so
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:29.360]  quirky and mentally ill like that vice reporter we saw this week who could hardly talk that it
[02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:35.840]  must be true because an idiot like this couldn't lie to me it just you see the phases like shark
[02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:44.640]  teeth of the new fraud they come up with and you can't beat the flimer from texas sorry let's go
[02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:49.360]  back to this twit here he is you know it wasn't long ago when meghan kelly seemed to have the
[02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:55.040]  media world on a string in 12 years at fox news which went from afternoon anchor to prime time
[02:03:55.040 --> 02:03:59.920]  host to media darlin oh my gosh as her contract with fox news near its end heli was one of the
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:04.800]  most sought after television personalities and she was dumb enough listen to you a dozen years
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:10.480]  at fox news i have decided to pursue a new challenge you're so cool it was nbc that won the
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:15.200]  meg and heli sweet she bet on the latest oh yeah 17 million dollars a year she's on the big shows
[02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:21.680]  now prime piece of television real estate her very own hour on the today show her very own hour
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:26.960]  in hollywood's butt so much for being here it's a role that kelly says she was born to do but
[02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:31.680]  thus far it's been a pretty bumpy start to their marriage critics have panned kelly's turn as a
[02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:36.320]  cheery morning talk show host and ratings have really been tepid at best and of course
[02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:41.280]  there have been awkward moments like this is it true that you became a lawyer and you became gay
[02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:48.080]  because of will so what happened how did you rise what happened we rejected you we're sick of you
[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:53.440]  so go off in your leftist corners and die you hate us having kids you just go die how's that sound
[02:04:55.280 --> 02:05:00.800]  now ladies and gentlemen we're running the biggest special we've ever had for our best
[02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:07.040]  selling product brain force now brain force plus there's 20 percent more in each bottle and we're
[02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:11.600]  now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the united states
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:17.120]  that we've been able to get it for less so i'm offering for the first time ever 50 percent off
[02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:21.200]  and i thought i could offer this for maybe a month i'm going to have to stop this special
[02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:27.440]  within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already
[02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:32.960]  you're stocking up they know how great it is a whole bunch of organic natural healthy known
[02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:38.960]  neutropics and if you want good clean focused energy then brain force is for you and you're
[02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:48.400]  supporting the broadcast at the same time it's a good deal at $39 it's 1996 at info wars life
[02:05:48.400 --> 02:06:04.320]  dot com or simply call toll free triple eight two five three three one three nine
[02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:18.000]  i
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:40.880]  You know, I hardly ever even talk about Megan Kelly's crashing and burning and flipping
[02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:45.120]  like a car running off a cliff in a Hollywood movie and exploding in flames down the bottom
[02:06:45.120 --> 02:06:51.200]  of a ravine. Because she was already politically destroyed when she went after Trump. Then her
[02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:57.200]  ratings were cut in half on Fox, so she jumped ship as a good mercenary would do over to NBC.
[02:06:57.200 --> 02:07:04.960]  Then she tried to destroy me and others and her ratings went down over 70%. And now even CNN has
[02:07:04.960 --> 02:07:11.520]  to report about NBC's Megan Kelly's problem. And the story here, the moral is going with the
[02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:16.640]  establishment when it's crashing and burning. Something that only happens every couple hundred
[02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:25.440]  years in a major cycle is not a good idea, even if you're a cold-blooded reptile type person
[02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:32.640]  like Megan Kelly. And so it shows how all these empty people think that the bigger the stage,
[02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:39.360]  the more produced it is, the more authentic and real it is. But even the little vapid folks
[02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:45.840]  that go watch NBC morning shows realize that Megan Kelly was always a has been.
[02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:54.720]  In truth, it was Roger Ailes puppeteering her that made her so popular. And Megan Kelly, if she
[02:07:55.360 --> 02:08:02.480]  offered to work here, I would refuse to give her a job unless we basically had her working here
[02:08:02.480 --> 02:08:08.640]  maybe as a court gesture. She could wear a little propeller hat on her head and she could,
[02:08:08.640 --> 02:08:16.640]  I guess, I don't know, maybe take out the garbage. That's a more respectful, honorable position
[02:08:17.280 --> 02:08:22.640]  being a custodian than being a mercenary. Maybe we'd allow her to do her her pittance here,
[02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:31.680]  or maybe pay some carbon indulgences to the Vatican or something. Who knows, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:08:31.680 --> 02:08:38.560]  the whole point is good old Megan Kelly has crashed and burned. And the poor little sociopath
[02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:46.880]  narcissists didn't even know that when she was here in our studios. So Megan Kelly, for myself
[02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:52.080]  and the rest of the American people, you're fired. And to the NFL and all the little
[02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:59.360]  trendy types that think they can look down their noses at us, we are done with you. We want you
[02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:05.520]  out of our lives, go away, stop trying to sexualize our children, stop trying to brain
[02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:11.760]  damage our culture and society because you're so twisted and so ugly and so fallen that misery
[02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:20.240]  loves company. And speaking of misery loving company, ladies and gentlemen, speaking of the
[02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:26.240]  globalist and all the little games that they play and the different things that they engage in,
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:34.640]  we now have the entire Russia investigation unraveling in a big way. And more news coming out
[02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:39.040]  how indeed it was true what Trump tweeted months ago that we reported on that Comey,
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:44.080]  then FBI director had ended the investigation of Hillary a full two months before he ever
[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:48.880]  interviewed her. And there are even documents now released by the FBI showing he engaged in
[02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:57.280]  massive fraud and criminal activity. That is at info wars.com and news wars.com. So the Clinton
[02:09:57.280 --> 02:10:04.960]  Nest that is Comey and Mueller and all the rest of them is just a pathetic group.
[02:10:06.080 --> 02:10:11.920]  Meanwhile, the New York Times reported back in 2015 that there was a uranium deal that Hillary did
[02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:15.920]  selling out the United States. Of course, we reported on it as well. And last year,
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:21.440]  we reported on the fact that Obama had killed the investigation into the uranium deal.
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:27.360]  But the Hill claims that they broke the news today and Sean Hannity is running with it. Hey,
[02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:35.520]  that's fine. That's kind of a trick folks do old news becomes new. It's just that the Hill is always
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:41.520]  reporting on how I'm fake news when we get more scoops they ever dreamed of in their life. But
[02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:48.080]  again, here is the New York Times cash flow to Clinton Foundation amid Russian uranium deal
[02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:56.400]  2015 April 23rd. And of course, Jay Johnson said last year, and also in this year,
[02:10:56.400 --> 02:11:03.040]  there is a political that they were ordered not to investigate the DNC server hacks or any of that
[02:11:03.040 --> 02:11:09.200]  other information. And now again, as I mentioned, we know that Comey lied about all that and it
[02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:17.520]  really stopped the investigation and had a staged fake interviews and fake fake interrogations of
[02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:23.360]  Hillary and other cohorts and that Lynch did meet on the airplane that there are 30 pages of
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:29.280]  documents with her criminal meeting with Bill Clinton. While he was under investigation, where
[02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:34.960]  obviously she was promising that he was promising that once Hillary stole the election, that indeed
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:42.800]  Loretta Lynch would continue to have that job. But as you know, the best laid plans of mice and men
[02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:50.400]  often go astray. Now let me get to this really important news dealing with Korea.
[02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:56.320]  A lot of people say, Hey, we're tired of hearing about Korea. We're not going to have a big war
[02:11:56.320 --> 02:12:02.240]  there. Well, the truth is, we're having a war. We've had a war. It's been going on since 1949.
[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:06.080]  Millions of people died in it. Hundreds of thousands of Americans and there's a cease fire.
[02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:11.920]  And the Clintons and the globalists gave nuclear fissile material and delivery systems to Kim
[02:12:11.920 --> 02:12:16.240]  Jong-un. And he's been threatening more and more people to the point that China is even having to
[02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:22.000]  move troops and threatening to move more troops to their border with North Korea, which is a big,
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:26.960]  big deal. So yes, I know America has problems and we've launched some wars we shouldn't have. And
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:32.160]  I was against those wars back when they were happening, back when they were so popular.
[02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:38.240]  Because I knew it was to take out non-radical Muslims and put in radical Muslims. Nuclear war
[02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:48.080]  may break out any moment says North Korea, U.N. envoy. This is RT. Kim In-Rong said North Korea
[02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:52.240]  is the only country in the world subjected to such an extreme and direct nuclear threat
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:13:00.800]  by the U.S. AP reports. Continuing, China plot to deploy army against North Korea
[02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:06.720]  could start World War III. It looks like the world is steamrolling its way to a third world war,
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:15.520]  a max lab article, up on infowars.com. And it continues. The photos of recent highway construction
[02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:19.920]  in China could be part of a contingency plan to invade North Korea or a massive huge army
[02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:24.240]  on their shared border. Well, China's admitted that. Experts for the newly uncovered plot
[02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:28.560]  could stoke the fires of World War III inevitably involving the United States.
[02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:32.880]  Yeah, the day before the Chinese dictator, known as a president, met with Trump earlier this year
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:40.400]  in Mar-a-Lago, he actually put out state-run media that U.S. don't strike the North. If we have to,
[02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:45.520]  we will hit them first. According to, they've had a lot of wars with Korea. According to the
[02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:51.840]  Express UK, Communist China has traditionally been North Korea's closest ally, but Kim Jong-un's
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:58.160]  continued nuclear and ballistic missile tests have tested Beijing's patients on the rising tensions
[02:13:58.160 --> 02:14:04.320]  worldwide. These new revelations also come as North Korea has spotted transporting 30-scud missiles
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:10.400]  from the south to the capital to Na Poo on the North Bay coast opposite China.
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:16.320]  New photos have emerged that reveal the communist superpower is building a six-lane highway
[02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:23.760]  in its desolately populated northeast on route to North Korea with most Chinese peasants not able
[02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:34.960]  to afford a luxury of a car. The construction of the G-1-1-1-2 G-on-Chung-O expressway has led experts
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:39.840]  to believe it could be used to quick deployment of tanks and troops. Yeah, that's why the signs on
[02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:45.760]  our highways are green. It's an Eisenhower plan copying the German Autobahn that the Germans
[02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:52.240]  thought was for their cars, was really for troops to move on. And so any country that wants to control
[02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:57.120]  its nation or fight outside invaders builds large roads especially up to its borders. Of course,
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:15:03.520]  those can be two-way roads as well, but that's absolutely true. New photos have emerged that
[02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:07.520]  reveal the communist superpower is building a six-lane highway. It's led to experts to believe
[02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:11.760]  it will be used for quick deployment of tanks and troops on the North Korean border. The photos
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:17.040]  obtained by Daily Star show Chinese construction workers digging tunnels through the mountains
[02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:23.040]  and massive cranes constructing bridges over rivers. Remember Lloyd Fein? That's American money.
[02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:29.280]  The 20-plus trillion that's come up missing out of the Pentagon and out of Congress. Most of it's
[02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:34.800]  gone to build up China. That was the big joke. Take all America's money and build up the communist
[02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:39.040]  regime for them and then have them deindustrialize us and leverage out all our jobs because no one
[02:15:39.040 --> 02:15:43.440]  could compete. But then along came the Liberty Movement to educate folks and along came Trump.
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:49.040]  So now we've got a fighting chance. How's that feel globalist scum in the hijacked DC? Stay with us.

[02:20:21.440 --> 02:20:34.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, get ready to meet the racist tranny that says all white people basically
[02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:40.960]  are inherently genetically evil. This is the same thing the Nazis said about folks that weren't
[02:20:40.960 --> 02:20:46.560]  quote Aryan. And this is brought to you by the state-run media, the BBC, and this is what they
[02:20:46.560 --> 02:20:54.320]  air basically 24-7. This is the culture control of the globalist as they destroy the nation state,
[02:20:54.320 --> 02:21:00.800]  turning the people against themselves using men like this individual or this woman, this
[02:21:00.800 --> 02:21:07.840]  this racist. We don't know what she is or he is. This racist says that white people are inherently
[02:21:07.840 --> 02:21:13.760]  the devil. Here it is. If white people want to see an improvement for people of color,
[02:21:13.760 --> 02:21:19.360]  they need to understand that racism is not learned. It's inherited and either consciously
[02:21:19.360 --> 02:21:24.800]  or unconsciously passed down through privilege. The uncomfortable truth is that the white race
[02:21:24.800 --> 02:21:32.400]  is the most violent and oppressive force of nature on earth. My worry is that whatever
[02:21:32.400 --> 02:21:37.920]  governments do to tinker with institutional racism, it is so ingrained in the fabric of British
[02:21:37.920 --> 02:21:43.760]  society that it is too late to do anything about it. Okay, so let's explain what the social engineers
[02:21:43.760 --> 02:21:48.160]  are doing here. They take the UK that first banned slavery and then fought a bunch of wars
[02:21:48.160 --> 02:21:52.720]  to stop it. And they take the strength of a country and turn it against them, a Christian nation.
[02:21:53.520 --> 02:21:57.200]  They don't talk about slavery going on in Africa or the Middle East right now. No, no, there's none
[02:21:57.200 --> 02:22:04.960]  of that. And it puts people like this gentleman, a racist guy wearing a wig, it puts this person
[02:22:04.960 --> 02:22:11.280]  up on a pedestal where they then tell you that there's never anything you can do.
[02:22:12.160 --> 02:22:17.680]  There's nothing you can do. You're inherently bad. I'm inherently good because I'm wearing a
[02:22:17.680 --> 02:22:22.560]  wig and dressed like a woman. Okay, fine. I don't care if you do that, but you're not gonna try to
[02:22:22.560 --> 02:22:28.320]  sit there and force feed young children as they do in the UK and they do in the US with tranny
[02:22:28.320 --> 02:22:35.440]  time where men dressed up like demons, you know, in clown makeup, literal clown makeup, some of
[02:22:35.440 --> 02:22:43.600]  these trannies look like penny wise, come in and terrorize the children. It is truly disgusting.
[02:22:44.400 --> 02:22:50.240]  And now California is the first to allow gender neutral birth certificates so we can abuse children
[02:22:50.240 --> 02:22:54.720]  more and tell them they're not a boy or a girl because now being a boy or girl, that hurts
[02:22:54.720 --> 02:23:01.280]  someone else's feelings that might not be a boy or girl. So call yourselves purple penguins in school,
[02:23:01.280 --> 02:23:10.240]  not boys and girls, because somebody else might be offended. And this individual, what is his name?
[02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:19.600]  His name, ladies and gentlemen, is Monroe Bergdorke. I'm not kidding. On screen,
[02:23:19.600 --> 02:23:24.640]  the tranny demon speaking to the kindergarten children as well. I mean, that is even more
[02:23:24.640 --> 02:23:29.840]  horrifying. But see, if you can, and by the way, it's not just this one case in Japan,
[02:23:30.480 --> 02:23:37.360]  in Germany, in the UK, in the US, we have footage at children's times all over the country at public
[02:23:37.360 --> 02:23:47.120]  schools where huge obese men who look scarier than John Wayne Gacy in demon outfits with horns come
[02:23:47.120 --> 02:23:54.320]  and say, I'm a tranny. So it's okay of a man with tattoos all over him creepily talks to your
[02:23:54.320 --> 02:23:58.560]  children. I'm sorry, I said kindergarten, these children look like they're four years old. I'm
[02:23:58.560 --> 02:24:05.840]  sorry. Pre K, ladies and gentlemen, this is the brainwashing. This is the control. This is what
[02:24:05.840 --> 02:24:12.480]  we're talking about to wage war biologically on humans. The globalist under their admitted UNESCO
[02:24:12.480 --> 02:24:19.120]  transhumanist program must first outlaw the two sexes male and female. And they've literally
[02:24:19.120 --> 02:24:26.160]  already begun it. And if you refuse to call somebody by G or Z or whatever in California,
[02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:32.480]  the crazy governor, Jerry Brown, the same one that legalized giving people HIV that'll kill you,
[02:24:33.280 --> 02:24:38.240]  the same governor says he will arrest you. So if you don't like your three year old,
[02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:45.040]  your four year old, your five year old to have the person in a literal get the clown,
[02:24:45.840 --> 02:24:52.320]  penny wise demon outfit, come and talk to your children. Imagine if this person came and tried
[02:24:52.320 --> 02:25:00.880]  to talk to your children at the park, you wouldn't walk, you'd run. But as long as they say it's
[02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:05.920]  for the children, it's okay. And in many of these tranny times that they're having at schools,
[02:25:05.920 --> 02:25:12.160]  they are teaching the children that they might not be a boy or a girl or they might be a boy of
[02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:16.800]  their girl or they might be a girl of their boy. This is something adults wouldn't do. And even
[02:25:16.800 --> 02:25:22.240]  Camille Paglia, a well known professor and a lesbian has said this is the end of our civilization
[02:25:23.040 --> 02:25:30.000]  and is serious, hardcore child abuse of our children. But I don't care about the mentally
[02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:33.840]  ill people that want to get dressed like demons and get near your children. They've obviously got
[02:25:33.840 --> 02:25:40.320]  a problem. I mean, this type of stuff always is obsessed with children. We know it. The issue
[02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:45.120]  is the controllers that if they can get us through quote tolerance to put up with this,
[02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:51.520]  we'll put up with anything. But in elementary school entrance forms all over the US and Europe now,
[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:57.680]  they're saying don't say boy or girl on the entrance form. So they're not tolerant of boy
[02:25:57.680 --> 02:26:04.800]  and girl. They're not tolerant of heterosexuals. They're not tolerant. It is a conquering. It is
[02:26:04.800 --> 02:26:14.480]  a takeover. It is an enslavement. It is a total and complete absolute mass domination
[02:26:15.280 --> 02:26:21.840]  of society with elites telling us that we have to submit to them getting between us and our
[02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:28.080]  children with vaccines, with GMOs, with these programs, with Heather has two mommies, daddy's
[02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:33.840]  friends, Steve, they love each other, they kiss, they sleep in the bed together. This is what
[02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:39.760]  they're teaching kindergartners and everywhere else it's called pedophilia. But when it's done
[02:26:39.760 --> 02:26:46.160]  institutionally and they can get away with people dressed up like demon clowns with your children,
[02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:50.560]  pull up tranny time in the New York schools. This is put out in New York Times like it's
[02:26:50.560 --> 02:26:56.160]  wonderful and it's the biggest scary looking group of weirdo potbellied men. Looks like a bunch of
[02:26:56.160 --> 02:27:02.080]  Dennis Hasterds running around with you clown makeup on, just hopping around, rubbing their
[02:27:02.080 --> 02:27:07.680]  giant bellies in front of children and you're like what alternate universe is this? What planet did
[02:27:07.680 --> 02:27:14.960]  I wake up in? But again, it's incrementally to make us submit, to break our will, to make us give
[02:27:14.960 --> 02:27:20.560]  in to them, to make us go along with what they want because all this is a societal wrecking ball
[02:27:20.560 --> 02:27:28.320]  to destroy any semblance of normality, any semblance of basic human biology that you see in the bees
[02:27:28.320 --> 02:27:34.400]  and you see in the birds and you see in the penipeds and you see in all the other major
[02:27:34.400 --> 02:27:43.120]  species of otters and of mice and of cows and of horses and of everything else ladies and gentlemen.
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:48.960]  They don't see them out telling pachyderms that it's sexist, that there's a male bull and a female
[02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:55.840]  cow, elephants. But again imagine if imagine if somebody in a demon outfit showed up next to a
[02:27:55.840 --> 02:28:03.440]  baby, a baby giraffe and said hi I'm a demon, be inclusive, don't be mean to me, let me wear
[02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:09.920]  demon horns and come up and look like a complete alien from another planet, let us space alien and
[02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:16.640]  by the way this is a program, they dress up like space aliens all over the United States and all
[02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:22.560]  over the world. I told you, you horrible demon psychopath outfits that make Pennywise look
[02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:31.360]  beautiful and they show up and they have their way with your children in demon outfits. I mean if
[02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:37.600]  you've got men that look like 400 pound goblin demons with your children there's nothing you
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:42.080]  all put up with, they're in the species on the planet that would let something that looks like
[02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:47.760]  a space alien get up close to its kids but only in America does it happen and I'm sick of it,
[02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:50.240]  I'm tired of it right now, I can't handle it more.

[02:32:53.200 --> 02:32:59.600]  your work sir on this great product. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:08.320 --> 02:33:13.600]  Battling the technocrats at point blank range and devastating globalist with hardcore results.
[02:33:13.600 --> 02:33:24.000]  You found it! The human resistance!
[02:33:35.520 --> 02:33:40.560]  Ladies and gentlemen I'm Alex Jones your host and I know what the globalists are doing. I've
[02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:44.320]  read their white papers. I've researched your psychological warfare operations. I'm going to
[02:33:44.320 --> 02:33:48.080]  break down the secrets of that here in just a moment and go to our guest with big breaking
[02:33:48.080 --> 02:33:52.160]  exclusive news that you won't want to miss believe me. But first off if you're a tv viewer
[02:33:52.880 --> 02:33:58.160]  if you're a radio listener I'll describe it. From Germany to Japan to the US to Canada to
[02:33:58.160 --> 02:34:03.760]  England to Australia there are government funded programs approved by UNESCO through the Departments
[02:34:03.760 --> 02:34:10.960]  of Education to send in men dressed as demons and they say oh it's a tranny and then they're
[02:34:10.960 --> 02:34:14.800]  going to teach your kids how nice it is to be a tranny starting at age three that we can back
[02:34:14.800 --> 02:34:20.720]  that photo out to show you. Now it started a few years ago with potbellied men dressed as women
[02:34:20.720 --> 02:34:24.480]  coming and doing it. You've never let somebody do this to your child at a park but it's done by
[02:34:24.480 --> 02:34:31.840]  the school so it's okay. Now it's people dressed like pennywise are even scarier knowing that if
[02:34:31.840 --> 02:34:37.440]  parents will put up with that it moves the overton window psychologically where you'll accept
[02:34:37.440 --> 02:34:44.160]  sexualization you'll accept vaccines you'll accept forced drugging and so all over the obscenity of
[02:34:44.160 --> 02:34:50.880]  scary men dresses clowns because once you accept oh we're just being accepting then it's clowns then
[02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:55.440]  it's oh the Tabistock Institute is assigning thousands of children a year in England at age
[02:34:55.440 --> 02:35:02.080]  three for gender reassignment Tabistock Institute is MI6 psychological warfare private bureau
[02:35:02.880 --> 02:35:09.920]  and they're the ones that come up the 60s with the plans to break up the family it is all ladies
[02:35:09.920 --> 02:35:20.080]  and gentlemen declassified so this is an admitted program this is an admitted plan and again if they
[02:35:20.080 --> 02:35:25.520]  can get mammals not just humans but any mammal to accept something dressed like a demon I mean if
[02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:31.680]  you dress like a demon in a field and try to walk over by a you know cows calf it would attack you
[02:35:31.680 --> 02:35:37.440]  you look like a person it wouldn't if you were dressed like a classical demon uh and you went
[02:35:37.440 --> 02:35:44.320]  up and did something like this uh to you know a baby uh giraffe or a baby elephant you'd get attacked
[02:35:44.320 --> 02:35:50.880]  but they're training everyone to accept this and saying be tolerant no we can't be tolerant
[02:35:50.880 --> 02:35:54.640]  because now they're saying the term mother and father isn't tolerant now they're saying they
[02:35:54.640 --> 02:36:00.880]  want to get rid of the term mother and father as well so the globalist aren't tolerant I see the
[02:36:00.880 --> 02:36:05.520]  big feminist publications all the time saying fundamentally white people are bad fundamentally
[02:36:05.520 --> 02:36:10.960]  the family's bad fundamentally marriage is a bad thing that's got to be gotten rid of this is a
[02:36:10.960 --> 02:36:17.680]  conquering by a group of brainwashed powerless you know normally mentally ill people in my view
[02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:24.640]  who believe they're part of this beautiful vanguard revolution having the taxpayers pay to have their
[02:36:24.640 --> 02:36:30.240]  genitals cut off and teaching children how to do it so again if they can get away with sending
[02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:36.240]  demon clowns to your school in the name of openness and then in the name of being libertarians which
[02:36:36.240 --> 02:36:45.200]  I am then the sky's the limit this is child abuse as Camille Paglia has said it's like last week
[02:36:45.760 --> 02:36:50.400]  Governor Jerry Brown signed an order where it's not even really a crime it's like a misdemeanor to
[02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:54.800]  knowingly give somebody HIV and kill them and they thought I was crazy when I said it was bad even
[02:36:54.800 --> 02:37:00.560]  the Washington Post said it's now basically legal or they said it's now a misdemeanor to kill somebody
[02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:06.000]  in California you see because the mental illness gets wilder and wilder and wilder and there's nobody
[02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:10.640]  holding these people back from what they want to do so the final frontier is your children they're
[02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:15.760]  not going to have kids they can't procreate they cut their genitals off just that's why they like
[02:37:15.760 --> 02:37:22.400]  Islam so much they cut the women's genitals off it's all about forcing you to cut your genitals off
[02:37:22.400 --> 02:37:28.560]  I've been studying these people man this is a pervert cult run by big crazy scientists that
[02:37:28.560 --> 02:37:34.000]  control the whole thing now as wild as that sounds true stranger than fiction let's go ahead now and
[02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:43.840]  shift gears into the next subject ladies and gentlemen it was early 2016 that Roger Stone first
[02:37:43.840 --> 02:37:49.120]  came on this broadcast he had just recently been the head of the successful Trump campaign
[02:37:50.720 --> 02:37:55.840]  and he laid out the fact that they were bringing up this Russian narrative to cover for Podesta and
[02:37:55.840 --> 02:38:00.800]  his brother and Hillary who had gotten 30 plus million dollars from the Russians just on a uranium
[02:38:00.800 --> 02:38:07.600]  deal now Sean Hannity great guy has said he's breaking big exclusive news tonight from the hill
[02:38:08.560 --> 02:38:14.560]  the hill scooped themselves even though they're going on and reported what we already knew the
[02:38:14.560 --> 02:38:18.800]  point is though they've been unsuccessful covering this up so now the hill is having to admit it
[02:38:19.680 --> 02:38:25.680]  FBI undercover Russian bribery plot again FBI uncovered Russian bribery plot before
[02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:32.880]  Obama administration approved controversial nuclear deal with Moscow and that Obama killed
[02:38:32.880 --> 02:38:38.240]  the investigation into Hillary and the Podestas and the Russia connection then the media spun
[02:38:38.240 --> 02:38:43.120]  that a few months ago that oh he killed it into Trump and he's the reason Hillary lost no he killed
[02:38:43.120 --> 02:38:50.320]  it because it led right to her doorstep and so that's the bombshell that's now been confirmed
[02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:54.800]  they also broke yesterday something that's old news from two months ago that we broke
[02:38:54.800 --> 02:39:00.880]  that Comey had already exonerated Hillary months before he concluded the investigation
[02:39:00.880 --> 02:39:05.040]  meaning it was a fake investigation at the end that's why she chose to speak to him and his
[02:39:05.040 --> 02:39:10.880]  investigators that was now confirmed so it's all coming out but if you can go back to the New York
[02:39:10.880 --> 02:39:20.160]  Times cash flow to Clinton Foundation amid Russian uranium deal April 23rd 2015 this is old news
[02:39:20.160 --> 02:39:25.680]  the cover-up is old news but the media is unable to cover this up now and I guess now
[02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:29.920]  Hanley's been given the green light to go with it showing their cover-up isn't working
[02:39:29.920 --> 02:39:38.000]  remember Jay Johnson saying hey the Democrats wouldn't let us in to their documents he said they
[02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:43.600]  wouldn't let us into their servers they were blocking it they said get a warrant so everything
[02:39:43.600 --> 02:39:49.680]  they accused Trump of is what they did now the man who first broke it all here in great detail
[02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:54.880]  is Roger Stone former head of the Trump campaign now info wars.com correspondent Roger
[02:39:56.080 --> 02:40:06.400]  Alex Washington DC is reeling not only because of the revelations by John Solomon and his colleagues
[02:40:06.400 --> 02:40:14.640]  at the Hill Solomon is a solid reporter he is the guy who originally broke the story with
[02:40:14.640 --> 02:40:24.400]  Sarah Carter about the super secret FISA court confirming that the Obama NSA spied on roughly
[02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:33.040]  30,000 Americans for political espionage purposes in violation of the law and the constitution
[02:40:34.480 --> 02:40:40.960]  some of what is about to break is known I have a report on what will happen tonight but first
[02:40:40.960 --> 02:40:49.680]  of all let's look at the incredible reporting by Solomon who now proves that the Obama administration
[02:40:49.680 --> 02:41:00.240]  the US attorney Rod Rosenstein and the associate director of the FBI Andrew McCabe were in charge
[02:41:00.240 --> 02:41:10.480]  of an investigation that detailed massive bribes within the Russian nuclear industry to officials
[02:41:10.480 --> 02:41:19.280]  in the United States laying the groundwork for the approval of the transfer of control of a
[02:41:19.280 --> 02:41:26.960]  substantial portion of America's enriched uranium output to a Russian front company
[02:41:26.960 --> 02:41:32.720]  controlled by Vladimir so the breaking news is we knew the payoffs were going on now we're just
[02:41:32.720 --> 02:41:37.920]  learning the details and it's being confirmed this is sensational well but here's what we will
[02:41:37.920 --> 02:41:45.120]  learn tonight my sources tell me that we are going to learn that there was a great deal more
[02:41:45.120 --> 02:41:52.640]  than was reported this morning by the hill in that Hillary's so-called reset with the Russians
[02:41:53.280 --> 02:42:02.880]  involved the sale of military technology and enormous payments to John Podesta in connection
[02:42:02.880 --> 02:42:11.040]  with that so-called reset so Hillary has been caught with her fingers in the cookie jar yet
[02:42:11.040 --> 02:42:16.880]  again now you remember Alex that from the beginning Hillary claims she had nothing to do with the
[02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:23.920]  committee that approved the transfer of this uranium sale to the Russians we now know that's
[02:42:23.920 --> 02:42:31.840]  a lie and we know that John Podesta was among those lining his pockets in the sale of additional
[02:42:31.840 --> 02:42:39.840]  military technology that is the bombshell that Sean Hannity will reveal in greater detail tonight
[02:42:42.640 --> 02:42:44.880]  we'll be right back with roger stone on the other side

[02:47:47.440 --> 02:47:51.200]  we've got trump and only a few of the things in we're battling the media the globalists the
[02:47:51.200 --> 02:47:57.200]  communist chinese the silicon valley all the slave factories in china
[02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:03.680]  loy blank fine and goldman sacks we're taking the republic back ladies and gentlemen and trumps
[02:48:03.680 --> 02:48:08.000]  forcing a lot of globalists to do his will but they're fighting to destroy him while they're at it
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:12.720]  roger stone's our guests and again i'm not trying to steal thunder from sean hannity
[02:48:12.720 --> 02:48:18.960]  uh just the facts are the hill and and and these reporters that he's mentioning
[02:48:20.320 --> 02:48:23.680]  the hill itself i don't like there are a lot of dis info about me but they do have some good
[02:48:23.680 --> 02:48:29.360]  reporters there it's kind of a mixed bag our exposing bombshell info about the details
[02:48:29.360 --> 02:48:34.560]  of the iranium deal that was reported on by the new york times back in 2015 that is super shady
[02:48:34.560 --> 02:48:40.160]  like the reservoir foundation and the witnesses and the documents as i told you back at the time
[02:48:40.160 --> 02:48:46.880]  of weapons transfers well that's all here so now we know that roger stone was dead on and we're only
[02:48:46.880 --> 02:48:51.040]  putting that out here because he's been to congress they said he's a russian agent with no evidence
[02:48:51.040 --> 02:48:55.840]  they've said i am so we need to point out that those of us that have been in the crosshairs of this
[02:48:55.840 --> 02:49:01.600]  are the ones that day one before they ever implicated roger he was saying look padesa is
[02:49:01.600 --> 02:49:07.680]  going to have his day uh you know the exact quote was his day in the his day in the chute his day in
[02:49:07.680 --> 02:49:11.920]  the dock we'll go back to him and then they use that clip from my show and others to say see
[02:49:12.960 --> 02:49:18.240]  they knew he was getting russian info what russians told us that padesa was paid off no
[02:49:18.240 --> 02:49:23.360]  it was because we were on the russia beat that we got put in as the russian agents that's why
[02:49:23.360 --> 02:49:28.720]  it's important we get the credit now of being right last year so that people understand why
[02:49:28.720 --> 02:49:33.520]  we were targeted for our own protection i mean is that not clear roger we need to make that clear
[02:49:33.520 --> 02:49:40.160]  to people no i think uh this goes well beyond anything we knew previously the fbi no i'm saying
[02:49:40.160 --> 02:49:45.680]  it confirms everything we said oh without we were targeted without any question whatsoever
[02:49:45.680 --> 02:49:52.000]  first of all let me point out that john padesa's russian business dealings were first revealed in
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:59.120]  the panama papers in january of last year and her car just blew up she just got killed interestingly
[02:49:59.120 --> 02:50:06.880]  so the reporter who first exposed padesa was brutally murdered only yesterday by a car bomb
[02:50:06.880 --> 02:50:14.400]  so alex be very careful when you start your car these people play for keeps but what we now know
[02:50:15.040 --> 02:50:21.440]  is that the fbi in the justice department had a full-on investigation proving multi million
[02:50:21.440 --> 02:50:28.800]  dollar bribery by the russians to us officials both in and out of government and this information
[02:50:28.800 --> 02:50:34.080]  was kept from the committee that made this decision was kept from the house and senate
[02:50:34.080 --> 02:50:40.800]  intelligence committees was essentially covered up now here's the irony alex the investigation
[02:50:40.800 --> 02:50:50.240]  started under fbi director robert muller it finished under fbi director james comey it was
[02:50:50.240 --> 02:50:59.040]  conducted by fbi associate director indrew mccabe and directed by us attorney rod rozenstein in other
[02:50:59.040 --> 02:51:06.320]  words the exact four individuals now pushing the trump is colluded with the russians narrative
[02:51:06.320 --> 02:51:13.440]  are the four guys who covered up this connection between the russians and hillary and the russians
[02:51:13.440 --> 02:51:20.160]  and massive bribes within the obama administration and by the way ironic exactly i mean that's why
[02:51:20.160 --> 02:51:24.080]  i'm bringing this up i'd even forgotten the point that the pentagon papers lady that exposed the
[02:51:24.080 --> 02:51:28.880]  podesta connection proving what you were already saying she got blown up and killed yesterday as
[02:51:28.880 --> 02:51:34.480]  all this comes to a head they tried to t-bone and kill you you also got poisoned with polonium
[02:51:34.480 --> 02:51:39.440]  and obviously the feds asked you not to talk about it anymore i mean this really is out of control
[02:51:39.440 --> 02:51:46.080]  there there's no question whatsoever look i think tonight's uh show with john kennedy
[02:51:46.080 --> 02:51:52.160]  is going to help blow this open even wider when it is learned why hillary clinton and
[02:51:52.160 --> 02:52:00.320]  podesta were paid so much by the russians because it involves the transfer we will learn of military
[02:52:00.320 --> 02:52:08.400]  technology these people would steal a hot stove or in some cases they would sell a hot stove this
[02:52:08.400 --> 02:52:14.480]  goes back to something as you know bill clinton did during his presidency selling military uh
[02:52:14.480 --> 02:52:20.640]  targeting missile targeting technology to the chinese for campaign contributions giving the
[02:52:20.640 --> 02:52:28.640]  russians one billion dollars that they use to build a hardened shelters for a future nuclear attack
[02:52:28.640 --> 02:52:35.760]  so the clinton's have a long history of selling out their country for big bucks and they've been
[02:52:35.760 --> 02:52:42.800]  caught red-handed doing it yet again and roger this is so sensational the only reason i brought up
[02:52:42.800 --> 02:52:47.600]  the fact that we had first all covered this and that more and more has now come out and then yes
[02:52:47.600 --> 02:52:52.080]  kennedy is breaking new information again you know i support kennedy i'm not in competition with him
[02:52:52.080 --> 02:52:56.400]  i just need to point out we were right we got demonized they have congressional hearings where
[02:52:56.400 --> 02:53:01.040]  they say you're a russian agent with no proof and they say i'm a russian agent with no proof and
[02:53:01.040 --> 02:53:06.640]  i'm directed by the kremlin all because pedesta was desperate to cover this up in the campaign
[02:53:06.640 --> 02:53:10.800]  that's why we've got to point out why we were targeted that's exactly right i mean look you
[02:53:10.800 --> 02:53:17.120]  have to take your hat off to the brilliance of it pedesta knows that he and his brother are deeply
[02:53:17.120 --> 02:53:24.480]  compromised there's the uranium deal there's the bank deal there's the gas prom deal bill and hillary
[02:53:24.480 --> 02:53:31.360]  have been paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees which are really thinly described
[02:53:31.360 --> 02:53:37.280]  bribes what better way to distract the american people from all of that than to say oh look over
[02:53:37.280 --> 02:53:43.680]  there donald trump he's in bed with putin he's in bed with the russia and have the lapdog media
[02:53:43.680 --> 02:53:47.840]  parent over and over again that they've got total proof and they've got nsa intercepts
[02:53:47.840 --> 02:53:52.720]  and it turns out they did spy illegally but there's nothing there they turned up absolutely
[02:53:52.720 --> 02:53:59.920]  nothing not a scintilla of evidence not a shred of evidence that would hold up in a court of law
[02:53:59.920 --> 02:54:06.880]  it is brilliant in a way uh this strategy of distraction i think you pointed it out day before
[02:54:06.880 --> 02:54:14.320]  yesterday the clintons and the democrats have systematically accused trump of everything that
[02:54:14.320 --> 02:54:20.160]  they themselves have been involved in whether it is sexual assault and the phony charges that they're
[02:54:20.160 --> 02:54:26.800]  trying to recycle now against our president or whether it is scheming and taking payoffs from
[02:54:26.800 --> 02:54:33.200]  the russians they're guilty but they project it on to donald trump well it's like the epstein deal
[02:54:33.200 --> 02:54:37.760]  he's on the plane 20 plus times with little girdles being flown to this island bill clinton is so
[02:54:37.760 --> 02:54:42.880]  they have a jane doe file a fake lawsuit claiming trump did it 20 years ago it turns out it's totally
[02:54:42.880 --> 02:54:48.400]  fake just to cover their bases whatever they've done they accuse trump of it's incredible so let

[03:00:17.840 --> 03:00:21.840]  the main reporter that broke podesta and the russia connection the bank account he had down
[03:00:21.840 --> 03:00:26.320]  there in pennama her car blew up yesterday she's an investigative reporter with major news
[03:00:26.320 --> 03:00:32.320]  agencies so i was just talking to uh well let's just repeat what you were saying off air roger
[03:00:32.320 --> 03:00:37.840]  i mean podesta attacks you and i by name every time he cans he he shakes with anger when he says our
[03:00:37.840 --> 03:00:44.880]  names uh and he is one slimy operator that thought he could sell out our secrets to uh russia and get
[03:00:44.880 --> 03:00:49.280]  away with it and he tried to hang around our necks and our president's neck what he did
[03:00:49.280 --> 03:00:53.360]  i mean let's talk about it if anything happens to us we didn't commit suicide
[03:00:53.360 --> 03:00:58.560]  and hillary and podesta and all of them are suspects number one and we know the courts
[03:00:58.560 --> 03:01:02.560]  aren't going to do justice but i'll tell you this for myself and my family something happens to me
[03:01:03.600 --> 03:01:09.200]  everybody knows what to do and i'm done talking and i'm not worried about it but something happens
[03:01:09.200 --> 03:01:13.280]  justice will be served one way or another there's a two-way street in this universe you want to
[03:01:13.280 --> 03:01:17.760]  say anything about that roger alex you're not you're not blowing smoke i can tell you that
[03:01:17.760 --> 03:01:23.200]  since my testimony before the house intelligence committee the number of death threats against
[03:01:23.200 --> 03:01:30.640]  me and my family has almost tripled but yesterday in the wake of our uncovering the fraudulent
[03:01:30.640 --> 03:01:38.240]  smear of the president for sexual assault they hit an all-time high 15 different death threats in
[03:01:38.240 --> 03:01:46.480]  the last 24 hours now alex my wife celebrated her birthday on saturday we had a surprise party for
[03:01:46.480 --> 03:01:56.160]  her mostly family and friends i posted it on twitter and the torrent of invective the entorrent of
[03:01:56.160 --> 03:02:01.280]  we're going to kill you we're going to kill your family they even threatened to kill my dogs that's
[03:02:01.280 --> 03:02:07.040]  how outrageous this has gotten i got to be honest with you i can't travel without security anymore
[03:02:07.040 --> 03:02:13.440]  because of people who want to just come up to you in the street i saw people pouring hot coffee on you
[03:02:13.440 --> 03:02:21.120]  when you went out west this is now times 10 the death threats against us simply because we are
[03:02:21.120 --> 03:02:29.200]  truth tellers simply because info wars has been the first one to expose the russia hillary connection
[03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:36.400]  so i'm sick of it but if anything happens to me if they tell you that i was killed in a hunting
[03:02:36.400 --> 03:02:44.160]  accident i don't hunt if they tell you that i was killed outside crossing the street believe me i
[03:02:44.160 --> 03:02:51.920]  look both ways i have never felt this kind of danger but let me say this they are not going
[03:02:51.920 --> 03:03:00.800]  to shut us up we are not going to be intimidated or silenced we are going to continue to speak
[03:03:00.800 --> 03:03:05.520]  the truth and that's why they hate us so much is because they know we're for real we're not
[03:03:05.520 --> 03:03:11.120]  backing down we're destroying them we're winning well it's one thing to threaten to kill mabel and
[03:03:11.120 --> 03:03:15.680]  you threaten to kill my wife you threaten to kill my children you threaten to kill my grandchildren
[03:03:15.680 --> 03:03:22.720]  kill my dog you're you're you're taking on more than you can handle pal i'm sick of the of these
[03:03:22.720 --> 03:03:28.560]  cowards who use fake names on twitter and facebook i was about to say historically it's the right
[03:03:28.560 --> 03:03:33.120]  wingers people better worry about uh you know taking action i mean we don't start fights we
[03:03:33.120 --> 03:03:37.600]  finish them i hope all these people understand they start their real civil war i mean we're
[03:03:37.600 --> 03:03:41.520]  they're going to be in some big trouble well our people believe in the second amendment
[03:03:41.520 --> 03:03:46.400]  and they're trained in the use of firearms and they're not going to have them withdrawn if the
[03:03:46.400 --> 03:03:53.200]  government seeks to take our guns i think they're going to regret it uh this is uh this has reached
[03:03:53.200 --> 03:03:59.840]  a fever pitch of hatred uh and the clintons have been feeding this pedestals but attacking both
[03:03:59.840 --> 03:04:05.760]  you and i on his twitter feed for months go by he doesn't tweet at all and then out of the blue
[03:04:05.760 --> 03:04:10.160]  he attacks roger stone and alex joe why is that because they've got so many enemies
[03:04:10.160 --> 03:04:16.000]  why do they hate us so much because we're getting to him alex because the truth hurts and they know
[03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:23.920]  that we are we are telling the truth uh and it doesn't it doesn't reflect well on them now with
[03:04:23.920 --> 03:04:29.440]  these revelations today and by the way big credit to john solomon of the hill and sarah

[03:07:07.920 --> 03:07:14.080]  nationalism is rising every big pusher of world government is either dying or has brain tumors
[03:07:14.080 --> 03:07:19.360]  2017 has seen brazil's key david rockefeller mccain i don't think will make it out of the year
[03:07:19.360 --> 03:07:24.160]  he looks like he's uh circling the gates of hell and i don't wish for any harm upon them but they're
[03:07:24.160 --> 03:07:29.120]  the bully thugs that funded isis and al qaeda to kill all the christians in syria they're the people
[03:07:29.120 --> 03:07:33.840]  coming for us to come in for our rights and engage in all the psychological warfare operations and

[03:07:40.960 --> 03:07:47.920]  them out of the way i mean i'm fleeing forward and their whole house of cards is coming down right
[03:07:47.920 --> 03:07:54.560]  now uh roger stones got some closing comments on how powerful this big hill report is validating
[03:07:54.560 --> 03:07:59.840]  everything the new york times said in 2015 everything we said in 2016 in our sources and
[03:07:59.840 --> 03:08:05.920]  why they put the russian narrative around all of our necks myself roger stone more than anybody
[03:08:05.920 --> 03:08:11.920]  uh paul maniforte you name it because the truth was they were the ones behind it so jack possebeck
[03:08:13.040 --> 03:08:17.920]  breaking all this down what do you make of how big these revelations are
[03:08:19.280 --> 03:08:23.760]  alex i want to explain some of this for people that are looking at it from the outside to understand
[03:08:23.760 --> 03:08:29.360]  how unprecedented of an operation this is we're talking about the fbi and it's outlined in this
[03:08:29.360 --> 03:08:36.160]  report here sending and recruiting sources and informants actually overseas working beyond
[03:08:36.160 --> 03:08:41.280]  the us borders now this is something that would definitely put them in a jurisdictional area where
[03:08:41.280 --> 03:08:47.680]  cia is going to have a lot of coverage over these activities and what's going on in terms of this
[03:08:47.680 --> 03:08:52.480]  there the fbi isn't just going to be running uh running sources throughout all of russia
[03:08:52.480 --> 03:08:56.800]  tying up with these guys without cia backing or at least some covers so they understand what's
[03:08:56.800 --> 03:09:02.240]  going on and they don't run parallel investigations so this is something the fact that this was
[03:09:02.240 --> 03:09:08.480]  known by eric holder the fact that it got to be so big that charges were were uh leveled against
[03:09:08.480 --> 03:09:13.680]  these russian leaders the and this is much further beyond the fbi yes that's what they're
[03:09:13.680 --> 03:09:18.160]  confirming now but the fbi does not have the ability to operate with impunity overseas
[03:09:18.160 --> 03:09:22.400]  this all has to fall under the purview of the ambassador of the station chief that's over
[03:09:22.400 --> 03:09:27.840]  there at the moscow and moscow and i expect that there are many more people at the highest
[03:09:27.840 --> 03:09:33.920]  levels of government clapper obviously as d and i would have known about this and we should add
[03:09:33.920 --> 03:09:37.920]  until they basically blew your cover you were doing this as a private citizen being politically
[03:09:37.920 --> 03:09:42.080]  involved with trump that you've been in naval intelligence and worked at classified facilities
[03:09:42.080 --> 03:09:46.400]  around the world and so you can actually speak to this but this is quite an investigation and
[03:09:46.400 --> 03:09:51.280]  i want to be clear i'm not poo pooing that they didn't break some big new stuff i'm only pointing
[03:09:51.280 --> 03:09:55.680]  out it validates everything that myself roger and you you've been accused of being a russian
[03:09:55.680 --> 03:10:00.400]  agent anybody that's patriotic to america that actually doesn't sell out in the shy comms or
[03:10:00.400 --> 03:10:06.160]  russia or the middle east the saudi arabians we're called the foreign agents with no evidence
[03:10:06.160 --> 03:10:10.880]  because that's what spies do when you catch them they point at you and say no no you're the spy
[03:10:10.880 --> 03:10:18.720]  and once again alex it's not the it's not the investigation it's the cover-up as jack just
[03:10:18.720 --> 03:10:24.640]  pointed out eric holder was full aware of the fruits of this investigation and he serves on
[03:10:24.640 --> 03:10:30.080]  the overseas private investment board that approved uranium sale but this information
[03:10:30.080 --> 03:10:37.120]  was withheld from that board so again they're caught in their own cover-up and who's involved
[03:10:37.120 --> 03:10:46.080]  muller combi mccabe rozenstein the very guys leading the charge now accusing our president of
[03:10:46.080 --> 03:10:52.560]  colluding with the russians for which they have produced no evidence whatsoever so the splash
[03:10:52.560 --> 03:10:59.280]  back on this in the next 48 hours will be extraordinary and as you point out it validates
[03:10:59.280 --> 03:11:04.720]  everything we have reported here at info wars from the beginning going back to early last year
[03:11:04.720 --> 03:11:09.360]  and again if people joined us just now this is like an eight page report from the hill
[03:11:09.360 --> 03:11:13.840]  fpi uncovered russian bribery plot before obama administration approved controversial nuclear
[03:11:13.840 --> 03:11:20.560]  deal with moscow it was known hillary was still allowed to do it other deals weapons technology
[03:11:20.560 --> 03:11:24.320]  they had documents they have witnesses they have the whole thing hillary thought she was
[03:11:24.320 --> 03:11:29.440]  going to win the presidency they didn't care obama killed the russia investigation never mind
[03:11:29.440 --> 03:11:35.360]  he killed the russia investigation because he knew that he thought hillary was going to be
[03:11:35.360 --> 03:11:41.040]  getting in then they had to spin it around and put it on trump closing comment on this information
[03:11:41.040 --> 03:11:49.280]  roger all right we've lost audio to roger real quick we're going to get his audio fixed let me
[03:11:49.280 --> 03:11:56.160]  go back to jack besovak jack this is just sensational how are they going to cover this up alex what
[03:11:56.160 --> 03:12:00.800]  they're going to try to do here is to say that oh this has been answered and litigated that this
[03:12:00.800 --> 03:12:04.960]  has already been done before hillary clinton tries to do this at the same time when they bring up
[03:12:04.960 --> 03:12:09.440]  sort of uh bill clinton's discretions in the past she says oh it's been litigated she'll try to say
[03:12:09.440 --> 03:12:14.480]  that the fbi investigated and there was nothing done well now we found that all of this stuff was
[03:12:14.480 --> 03:12:20.160]  going on as far back as the original muller years it was continued under comey who was of course hand
[03:12:20.160 --> 03:12:25.760]  picked by muller to replace and that's why muller's so desperate because he's a king involved in it
[03:12:25.760 --> 03:12:31.840]  remember him with the briefcase delivering the samples yes he was the one he's always been the
[03:12:31.840 --> 03:12:38.880]  bag he actually delivers the russians the goods and it's all confirmed and we now know and it was
[03:12:38.880 --> 03:12:45.120]  so we really should have your eye or roger on the tarmac here's the uranium and then they're
[03:12:45.120 --> 03:12:50.400]  saying we're the russian agents they're gonna say they're gonna say who gave alex jones the uranium
[03:12:51.120 --> 03:12:54.640]  and then and then i guess the worry would be that you would keep it for yourselves and use the
[03:12:54.640 --> 03:13:00.240]  and use the power of the info war studio down there but no it's it's it's completely unbelievable
[03:13:00.240 --> 03:13:04.400]  because muller of course and this goes back alex the stuff that you've been talking about for the
[03:13:04.400 --> 03:13:09.520]  last 15 years all of the stuff that came out in the patriot act and warrantless wiretapping
[03:13:09.520 --> 03:13:14.080]  all of the stuff where they're now moving in with russia and you notice that on the russian side
[03:13:14.080 --> 03:13:19.520]  they were very careful to exclude vladimir putin or any of the other major oligarchs in russia
[03:13:19.520 --> 03:13:24.000]  they targeted on this one specific guy and they said look someone needs to go down it's gonna be
[03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:30.000]  this guy and oh by the way he just happened to be a rival of putins in within russian government
[03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:35.120]  and russian political circles so it almost begs the question were the clinton's and the obama
[03:13:35.120 --> 03:13:40.560]  administration actually colluding to do the bidding of vladimir putin so now we're learning
[03:13:40.560 --> 03:13:44.880]  that the stuff that they're turning on us this is how they knew about all this because they were
[03:13:44.880 --> 03:13:48.800]  the ones doing it all along with the rush right jack the stuff with the russian intel contact
[03:13:48.800 --> 03:13:52.720]  patriot talk show host naval intelligence you're gonna break all this down coming up as you take
[03:13:52.720 --> 03:13:57.440]  over two more minutes left roger your audio is back this is so sensational i even forgot about
[03:13:57.440 --> 03:14:03.920]  the former fbi director delivering uranium to russia as part of this deal on on a tarmac again i mean
[03:14:03.920 --> 03:14:11.440]  you can't make this up no and the irony of having uh robert muhler now sitting in judgment on the
[03:14:11.440 --> 03:14:18.160]  president let's be very clear he is going to excuse the expression bring some trumped up charges
[03:14:18.160 --> 03:14:24.800]  against our president this is coming just as sure as the sun comes up in the morning and anyone who
[03:14:24.800 --> 03:14:30.320]  doesn't see this is being not and why did the president say today that he's not gonna fire muhler
[03:14:30.320 --> 03:14:35.920]  deeply disappointed i think his advisors convinced him that the fire storm would be too great and
[03:14:35.920 --> 03:14:42.640]  that he should simply tough it out i think the fact that muhler auditioned interviewed with the
[03:14:42.640 --> 03:14:50.000]  president for komi's job the day after komi was fired that's a conflict of interest once he was
[03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:55.680]  crossed passed over for that job it created a motive but how about him we forget he had
[03:14:55.680 --> 03:15:00.800]  medically delivered the uranium in the illegal deal he's literally a james bond villain i mean
[03:15:00.800 --> 03:15:06.960]  this guy's a joke and if we had a real attorney general who was committed to enforcing the law
[03:15:07.600 --> 03:15:15.040]  right now the guys facing prosecution would be muhler komi rozenstein and mccabe instead
[03:15:15.040 --> 03:15:22.240]  who's in their crosshairs but donald j trump outrageous just outrageous unbelievable all
[03:15:22.240 --> 03:15:27.120]  right jack posovic's taking over my head is spinning please pray for info wars please pray
[03:15:27.120 --> 03:15:32.320]  for all the guests uh and please pray for justice because we're fighting to take our country back
[03:15:32.320 --> 03:15:38.160]  but it is neck and neck with these evil forces and i'd even forgotten that muhler was the bag
[03:15:38.160 --> 03:15:43.520]  man for the uranium deal and of course he ordered the investigation shut down he's the one delivering
[03:15:43.520 --> 03:15:49.440]  the goods i mean these people are hardcore criminals we'll be right back with jack posovic

[03:21:53.920 --> 03:21:59.200]  that's what they're doing right now there's also 50 percent off caveman with brave for with brain
[03:21:59.200 --> 03:22:03.520]  force i'm telling you guys if when you try this stuff and i tried it for the first time not very
[03:22:03.520 --> 03:22:11.600]  long ago it gives you clarity it doesn't make you feel jittery it doesn't make you feel so wired up
[03:22:11.600 --> 03:22:16.960]  like you know an energy drink would like a monster or a red bull this stuff it it gives you this kind
[03:22:16.960 --> 03:22:23.280]  of clarity you feel a little warm i actually felt a little warm that that's just my own personal
[03:22:23.280 --> 03:22:27.120]  experience but in a good way right in a good way like i almost like having a cup of coffee
[03:22:27.120 --> 03:22:33.440]  and you felt warm you feel good you are ready to go forward and it it doesn't give you that crash
[03:22:33.440 --> 03:22:38.800]  that a sugary drink was it doesn't make you feel all wired out that's why i like the brain force
[03:22:38.800 --> 03:22:44.240]  and that's why i can't believe that they actually have it at 50 percent off i believe it's just
[03:22:44.240 --> 03:22:48.640]  going to be this week so if you want that 50 percent off you've got to get in and get it
[03:22:48.640 --> 03:22:54.720]  this week all the way down 1996 right now and it's amazing thank you so much guys for going
[03:22:54.720 --> 03:23:00.560]  to infowarstore.com and supporting the broadcast supporting everything we have to go on forward
[03:23:00.560 --> 03:23:06.480]  here so one of the things that i was just checking out in the break i actually went and pulled up
[03:23:06.480 --> 03:23:15.040]  the old report from wikileaks to read what they reported a 2009 cable that came out and they put
[03:23:15.040 --> 03:23:19.520]  it up on their twitter account so i put i retweeted it to my twitter so you guys if you guys go to
[03:23:19.520 --> 03:23:27.120]  twitter at jackpasobic you'll see it there and it says i'll action request embassy moscow is
[03:23:27.120 --> 03:23:33.680]  requested to alert at the highest appropriate levels the russian federation that fbi director
[03:23:33.680 --> 03:23:39.600]  muller plans to deliver the highly enriched uranium sample once he arrives to moscow on
[03:23:39.600 --> 03:23:45.360]  september 21st now remember this is back in 2009 the embassy is requested to convey the
[03:23:45.360 --> 03:23:51.360]  information with regards to the chain of custody and request details on the russian fed russian
[03:23:51.360 --> 03:23:57.280]  federations plan for picking up the material the embassy is also requested to reconfirm
[03:23:57.280 --> 03:24:03.040]  the understanding from fsb verbally that there'll be no issue with the russian ministry of aviation
[03:24:03.040 --> 03:24:07.680]  so folks you look at all of the different players that are involved here right you look at all of
[03:24:07.680 --> 03:24:13.200]  the different players and this is wikileaks this has come out oh excuse me this actually was 2008
[03:24:13.200 --> 03:24:19.280]  so they released it 2009 uh we're probably looking at september 21st 2008 which is very
[03:24:19.280 --> 03:24:23.920]  interesting and we'll have to go back and verify which year it was because if it was 2008 that's
[03:24:23.920 --> 03:24:30.800]  actually the final year of the bush administration prior to barack obama taking office uh not very
[03:24:30.800 --> 03:24:36.080]  long later in 2009 but that's definitely a big interest but what we've seen folks is that muller
[03:24:36.080 --> 03:24:42.000]  comey and all of these people have been running their own deep state their own shadow government
[03:24:42.000 --> 03:24:47.040]  aside from whoever is president they're continuing on to do whatever it is that their plans have been
[03:24:47.680 --> 03:24:51.600]  they're working at the highest levels of our government and the highest levels of the government
[03:24:51.600 --> 03:24:57.680]  of russia so when we look at these situations so we're seeing the cable yes was 2009 august
[03:24:57.680 --> 03:25:03.360]  so that's what we have to do we have to figure out when exactly the trip was whether it was 2008
[03:25:03.360 --> 03:25:10.800]  or 2009 but when it comes down to folks with all of these people are authorized to know about a
[03:25:10.800 --> 03:25:16.800]  trip like this to know that there's going to be a drop off of course of uranium highly enriched
[03:25:16.800 --> 03:25:23.120]  uranium one of the most controlled and watched substances in the entire world this is not going
[03:25:23.120 --> 03:25:28.800]  to be something that's only contained at the fbi level all right when you involve the ambassador
[03:25:28.800 --> 03:25:35.120]  you're automatically involving us intelligence we see in the cable in the leaked cable that it also
[03:25:35.120 --> 03:25:41.920]  involved russian intelligence the fsb the fsb is one of the pre the um successor agencies
[03:25:41.920 --> 03:25:48.400]  to the kgb so the kgb was under ussr fsb is basically a federal security bureau is kind of
[03:25:48.400 --> 03:25:54.720]  how it translates is is basically their version of the cia they also have no other organizations
[03:25:54.720 --> 03:26:00.400]  like gru and ones that that go out there but fsb is basically the lead what we know then
[03:26:00.400 --> 03:26:07.120]  is that there is much wider understanding of these connections much deeper connections between
[03:26:07.120 --> 03:26:11.840]  their government intelligence services and our government's intelligence services so it also
[03:26:11.840 --> 03:26:19.920]  begs the question then if these connections if these relationships were had as far back as 2009
[03:26:20.560 --> 03:26:26.960]  if these investigations even as it has been reported in the hill we're going back going on as far
[03:26:26.960 --> 03:26:35.600]  back as 2009 then what exactly are they investigating now when it comes to this question of did russian
[03:26:35.600 --> 03:26:39.840]  intelligence collude with the trump campaign so if you go with me on this they're telling us
[03:26:39.840 --> 03:26:45.360]  that they had russian intelligence and all of these russian active investigations going for
[03:26:45.360 --> 03:26:50.320]  almost a decade at this point but now they're gonna tell us that they're opening new investigations
[03:26:50.320 --> 03:26:55.600]  on russian intelligence well it turns out that you guys were already working with russian intelligence
[03:26:55.600 --> 03:27:00.320]  as far back as 2009 so you see how it's totally flipped around if they were working with russian
[03:27:00.320 --> 03:27:06.480]  intelligence as far back as 2009 what exactly are they investigating today what is it that
[03:27:06.480 --> 03:27:11.600]  muhler is up to when it comes to trump couldn't he just call his buddies at fsb that he met with
[03:27:12.080 --> 03:27:16.640]  when he flew the flew over there and handed them over the iranium couldn't he just call them up
[03:27:16.640 --> 03:27:21.680]  and find out what was going on couldn't he just go back and see wouldn't he have been alerted or
[03:27:21.680 --> 03:27:27.920]  tipped off by anybody that the russians were trying to collude in one sense and folks that is how
[03:27:27.920 --> 03:27:34.480]  you know that this stuff is false that is how we know because we use the simple process of
[03:27:34.480 --> 03:27:41.280]  elimination we connect the dots that nobody wants us to connect and to ask these questions
[03:27:41.280 --> 03:27:46.160]  is to know the answer because if they knew what the russians were doing as as far back as 2009
[03:27:46.160 --> 03:27:51.200]  2010 if they were colluding with the russians covering up the clinton investigations covering
[03:27:51.200 --> 03:27:55.920]  up their involvement in all of these deals with millions of dollars flowing then clearly they
[03:27:55.920 --> 03:28:01.280]  would have known if russia was involved with donald trump which we know now that he wasn't
[03:28:01.280 --> 03:28:06.000]  because they haven't been able to produce any evidence instead what we've seen is evidence of
[03:28:06.000 --> 03:28:13.040]  these of this racketeering scheme millions of dollars witness statements actual documents hard
[03:28:13.040 --> 03:28:18.560]  evidence where the congressional hearings where are the indictments why isn't the house select
[03:28:18.560 --> 03:28:25.120]  committee on intelligence calling robert muhler immediately and they should call him immediately
[03:28:25.120 --> 03:28:30.160]  to testify to explain what exactly was going on to the american people because after all
[03:28:30.160 --> 03:28:34.720]  we're talking about russia colluding in u.s. government and i'm fairly certain that millions
[03:28:34.720 --> 03:28:40.320]  in dollars in kickbacks to the clinton foundation would include russian meddling that is this

[03:33:26.320 --> 03:33:33.120]  jack was sitting in fourth hour we just covered all of the latest and breaking knowledge that we've
[03:33:33.120 --> 03:33:38.960]  been that's been revealed to us regarding the collusion between hillary clinton the russians
[03:33:38.960 --> 03:33:45.520]  barack obama and robert muhler smack dab at the heart of all of it everything that's breaking
[03:33:45.520 --> 03:33:51.440]  down alex reminded us of course about the highly enriched uranium that robert muhler personally
[03:33:51.440 --> 03:33:57.760]  flew himself to the russian federation working with fsb this sounds like the plot of the worst
[03:33:57.760 --> 03:34:02.960]  tom clancy novel you've ever heard but unfortunately we're living through it ourselves folks
[03:34:02.960 --> 03:34:07.440]  and that is what we're going to be breaking down every day here now a lot of people want to know
[03:34:08.400 --> 03:34:15.040]  we talk about how the info wars the info war i should say is funded by the listeners right info
[03:34:15.040 --> 03:34:21.040]  war store dot com that's where all of this comes up but where does the left get their funding for
[03:34:21.040 --> 03:34:26.160]  these operations where does the left get their funding for these programs for all of the social
[03:34:26.160 --> 03:34:31.760]  justice activism for all of these attacks that they're launching on our freedom on our liberty
[03:34:31.760 --> 03:34:35.920]  on our way of life on our traditions where do they get the funding for all this because we
[03:34:35.920 --> 03:34:42.800]  know it's not cheap we know these global programs we know these things have massive price tags on
[03:34:42.800 --> 03:34:48.960]  them how are they getting funding for this well there's a new report out of the wall street journal
[03:34:48.960 --> 03:34:54.160]  today so this is not something of course they're going to call this conspiracy theories every time
[03:34:54.160 --> 03:34:59.680]  we made to mention this guy's name but it's george soros again everyone's favorite demon
[03:34:59.680 --> 03:35:09.280]  this guy george soros he's transferring 18 billion dollars of his personal wealth to the open society
[03:35:09.280 --> 03:35:15.280]  foundation that is the political arm of his organization that this is a massive massive
[03:35:15.280 --> 03:35:20.960]  move over the entire span of george soros his career the open societies foundation has only
[03:35:20.960 --> 03:35:27.040]  spent about 14 billion and that's billion with a b you're talking about more money than the defense
[03:35:27.040 --> 03:35:31.280]  department of some countries more money than some countries spend on their national security
[03:35:31.280 --> 03:35:39.040]  their military george soros is spending this money on actions and subversive activities around the
[03:35:39.040 --> 03:35:45.200]  world the refugee program pushing for refugees bringing refugees over talking about how to set
[03:35:45.200 --> 03:35:51.200]  them up giving them money demanding that countries break down their borders and bring these people
[03:35:51.200 --> 03:35:59.040]  in demanding that countries undergo this massive migration and demographic shift you know it's
[03:35:59.040 --> 03:36:03.840]  interesting because we know when i was younger and i'm not an old guy i'm 32 but when i was younger
[03:36:03.840 --> 03:36:08.640]  when you did philanthropy right when you did humanitarian work when you had donations you
[03:36:08.640 --> 03:36:13.280]  would donate to help the people in those areas right so you would they would say i would say
[03:36:13.280 --> 03:36:16.640]  stuff like send money to help the rainforest we sent the money to the rainforest also all the
[03:36:16.640 --> 03:36:20.800]  liberals used to say and then they used to say well we need to help africa we need to feed africa
[03:36:20.800 --> 03:36:26.720]  so you'd buy money to get food and then you send the food to africa but now it's george soros who's
[03:36:26.720 --> 03:36:32.720]  come along and said no no no what we need to do is we need to help those people by importing them
[03:36:32.720 --> 03:36:37.520]  from their countries and bringing them into our countries bringing them into america bringing them
[03:36:37.520 --> 03:36:42.480]  into europe bringing them into different parts of the world where they didn't live to begin with
[03:36:42.480 --> 03:36:48.640]  to allow them to live off of the welfare system to allow them to become a huge strain on public
[03:36:48.640 --> 03:36:54.960]  resources and then also to bring their culture to bring their religion islam in many cases in this
[03:36:54.960 --> 03:37:02.800]  situation into our countries and not caring whatsoever about the massive cultural friction
[03:37:02.800 --> 03:37:08.560]  which is probably the nicest way i could put it but terrorism rape epidemics everything else that
[03:37:08.560 --> 03:37:15.440]  goes along with it now we know that 18 billion dollars is being invested by george soros now
[03:37:15.440 --> 03:37:22.320]  look george soros is 87 years old george soros knows that his time at least on in the physical
[03:37:22.320 --> 03:37:27.440]  world in this world is not he's not long for it right he's he's getting up there in age
[03:37:28.160 --> 03:37:37.040]  he's not going to be around forever so this is his way of making sure that his money is spent
[03:37:37.040 --> 03:37:42.560]  for social welfare excuse me social justice programs on all of these things these and we've
[03:37:42.560 --> 03:37:47.360]  got yeah we've got it up on the info wars website right now if you guys go to info wars dot com you
[03:37:47.360 --> 03:37:52.640]  can see it there what he's doing is he's saying it up this also helps him by the way with the
[03:37:52.640 --> 03:37:56.880]  death tax right this helps him keep away from that because that money is now going to be in the
[03:37:56.880 --> 03:38:02.000]  foundation so instead of him having to worry or his descendants his son alex soros having to worry
[03:38:02.000 --> 03:38:07.280]  about paying that death tax that obama put in he will now actually be able to just give it to the
[03:38:07.280 --> 03:38:10.880]  foundation and the foundation will be able to spend it however they want that is the money
[03:38:10.880 --> 03:38:17.840]  that we've reported so often co goes to antifa that goes to these groups like black lives matter
[03:38:17.840 --> 03:38:25.280]  that that have put so many of american cities on fire right this is what he's doing he's setting
[03:38:25.280 --> 03:38:31.760]  it up so that even if he passes away right which the guy's an investor right he understands how
[03:38:31.760 --> 03:38:35.920]  how to speculate he understands how to look five and ten years down the road he's no he knows he's
[03:38:35.920 --> 03:38:41.840]  not going to be around forever so this is his down payment on keeping the resistance as they call it
[03:38:42.800 --> 03:38:48.080]  going forward even in the event of his untimely demise but what it really is is we and we know
[03:38:48.080 --> 03:38:53.360]  this they are not the ones who are the true resistance they are the ones who are the establishment
[03:38:53.360 --> 03:38:58.640]  they're the ones who are running these programs they're in bed with almost every government
[03:38:58.640 --> 03:39:03.520]  in the western world they've been embedded with the clinton's with the obamas they've been embedded
[03:39:03.520 --> 03:39:07.760]  with the Rothschilds they've been embedded all throughout the eu and brussels we know David
[03:39:07.760 --> 03:39:12.480]  yonker we know all of this for so long they are not the resistance they call themselves the resistance
[03:39:12.480 --> 03:39:17.680]  but only because trump won right no they're the ones who've been pushing this program have been
[03:39:17.680 --> 03:39:24.160]  pushing this agenda for years and years and their momentum almost reached a fever pitch if you will
[03:39:24.160 --> 03:39:30.240]  right before donald trump was elected and now you are seeing the backlash to that now you're
[03:39:30.240 --> 03:39:36.160]  seeing the backlash to their massive great leap forward chairman Mao the great leap forward that's
[03:39:36.160 --> 03:39:42.000]  what he had in communist china soviet russia they had Stalin's five-year plans that is what
[03:39:42.000 --> 03:39:48.160]  soros is pushing forward now he's pushing a great leap forward in terms of this multicultural
[03:39:48.160 --> 03:39:54.640]  demographic replacement the multicultural migration of of these peoples into the us into europe and
[03:39:54.640 --> 03:40:01.040]  pushing for more and more of these social justice programs the 18 billion and you know it's interesting
[03:40:01.040 --> 03:40:06.400]  because the media will come and comment on us and they say well poesobic you know he and alex jones
[03:40:06.400 --> 03:40:11.120]  well they just say that everything it goes back to soros that soros is behind this that soros is
[03:40:11.120 --> 03:40:17.040]  behind that and i'll say well i've got documents that prove that he is i've actually tracked the
[03:40:17.040 --> 03:40:21.920]  funding i've actually gone in you can because charities right this is all done under the auspices
[03:40:21.920 --> 03:40:26.800]  of charity that's the hilarious part about this they've set up the charity laws and the charitable
[03:40:26.800 --> 03:40:31.040]  giving laws because we're charitable people especially in america we want to actually
[03:40:31.040 --> 03:40:37.520]  help but what these people do is they twist the the charity laws around to make their left wing
[03:40:37.520 --> 03:40:43.840]  progressive globalist policies be considered charity and so all of this money is considered a
[03:40:43.840 --> 03:40:48.240]  write-off to charity that's like hillary clinton they said they said are you going to give back
[03:40:48.240 --> 03:40:53.440]  the 250 000 that harvey weinstein gave to uh the clinton foundation he said well no i don't have to
[03:40:53.440 --> 03:40:57.920]  give it back because that was money he donated to charity and the clinton foundation was a charity
[03:40:57.920 --> 03:41:02.800]  and we already spent it on charitable causes and it's like uh can you actually point to something
[03:41:02.800 --> 03:41:07.120]  that you spent the money on other than yourself the destruction of hady and your daughter's wedding
[03:41:07.120 --> 03:41:11.920]  mrs clinton mrs clinton and then she's you know she's she's what is she tossing coffee over the
[03:41:11.920 --> 03:41:17.280]  back of her head again while she while she goes down as she claims so this 18 billion it's a down
[03:41:17.280 --> 03:41:24.560]  payment a down payment on the globalist war against liberty the war against freedom the war
[03:41:24.560 --> 03:41:31.280]  against turning back our countries to sovereign powers it's a war against sovereignty that is
[03:41:31.280 --> 03:41:37.360]  what this 18 billion is a down payment on and his son alexoros he's tied in with so many of these
[03:41:37.360 --> 03:41:42.800]  same individuals that his father is he's tied in at higher levels he's much much younger than his
[03:41:42.800 --> 03:41:50.000]  father he is i think been groomed by his father you can kind of see to step in and fill his shoes
[03:41:50.000 --> 03:41:55.120]  when he goes away when if he does pass away so that is what the 18 billion is so they're not going
[03:41:55.120 --> 03:42:02.400]  anywhere soon folks we've got donald trump in office and that's one guy that's one major major
[03:42:02.400 --> 03:42:08.800]  beachhead that we've taken against globalism and against these forces but there's so much more we

[03:42:15.040 --> 03:42:20.160]  doing breaking down these things looking forward they're thinking forward we're going to be thinking
[03:42:20.160 --> 03:42:26.160]  10 steps forward because we see this 18 billion and we're going to conduct investigations on this
[03:42:26.160 --> 03:42:31.520]  open society foundation the same way we're conducting investigations on clinton because this is not
[03:42:31.520 --> 03:42:37.120]  going to stand in this country and it's not going to stop this movement going forward of bringing

[03:48:32.560 --> 03:48:38.720]  mainstream media has all but completely dropped this story following the twists and changes of
[03:48:38.720 --> 03:48:44.320]  everything that's going on with the timeline in that story and the latest bombshell i just saw
[03:48:44.880 --> 03:48:50.480]  something on twitter not too long ago that it may it may be that some allegations that the security
[03:48:50.480 --> 03:48:56.080]  guard this hose compost may have had a different name may have had shared social security numbers
[03:48:56.080 --> 03:49:01.360]  with other people that's something that you see a lot with illegal immigrants something that you
[03:49:01.360 --> 03:49:05.600]  see that comes up in a lot of times in those investigations if someone has a shared social
[03:49:05.600 --> 03:49:10.000]  security number because they're selling social security numbers common practice that's used
[03:49:10.000 --> 03:49:15.520]  with illegal immigrants was that the case here hopefully we can bring all this down but before
[03:49:15.520 --> 03:49:22.480]  i do that i want to make you guys aware of some of these huge specials and actually a combo that's

[03:50:43.920 --> 03:50:53.440]  yesterday in washington dc there's a very interesting press conference that was held between the
[03:50:53.440 --> 03:51:00.400]  president of the united states donald trump and an unlikely shall we say an unlikely partner
[03:51:00.400 --> 03:51:06.400]  in crime the senate majority leader mitch mcconnell now trump and mcconnell have been at odds quite
[03:51:06.400 --> 03:51:12.800]  frequently lately over most famously of course down in alabama mcconnell supported mcconnell was
[03:51:12.800 --> 03:51:18.000]  well i should say he supported luther strange got trump on board with them but then the grassroots
[03:51:18.000 --> 03:51:22.720]  rose up and said no we want roi more to win because he's actually the trump nationalist
[03:51:22.720 --> 03:51:27.200]  candidate luther strange is the globalist so mcconnell's candidate went down in flames
[03:51:27.200 --> 03:51:32.080]  steve bannon and other trump nationalists were supporting more then mcconnell couldn't get health
[03:51:32.080 --> 03:51:37.600]  care passed couldn't get tax reform passed couldn't pass funding for the wall so many different bills
[03:51:37.600 --> 03:51:41.760]  they're talking about a bipartisan bill now on health care we'll have to see how that shakes out
[03:51:41.760 --> 03:51:47.520]  but if you look uh they actually viewed together and trump said well mcconnell has asked me politely
[03:51:47.520 --> 03:51:55.600]  if i could talk to trumps uh allies and get them to stop actually um targeting mcconnell
[03:51:55.600 --> 03:52:01.280]  so much could you lay off could you stop attacking because i can tell you guys there is a group that
[03:52:01.280 --> 03:52:07.120]  we started called rev 18 uh it was started with myself mike sternovich jeff geesey the website
[03:52:07.120 --> 03:52:14.880]  it's rev 18 pack dot com we specifically targeted mitch mcconnell and launched a hashtag ditch
[03:52:14.880 --> 03:52:20.800]  mitch campaign to go after him to explain what he's done we're calling it our diss list now most
[03:52:20.800 --> 03:52:25.760]  most groups do endorsements we did a dis endorsement he called it our diss list we are the group we
[03:52:25.760 --> 03:52:31.360]  think that actually mcconnell was talking about and said look we're gonna we were doing a $5,000
[03:52:31.360 --> 03:52:36.080]  contest it's actually still open we haven't picked an overall winner yet but if you guys go to rev 18
[03:52:36.080 --> 03:52:42.240]  pack dot com you can see this contest we announced that we're doing a $5,000 giveaway to the best
[03:52:42.240 --> 03:52:48.080]  meme the best video uh that anyone submitted regarding mitch mcconnell and whether and
[03:52:48.080 --> 03:52:53.600]  basically saying that we don't want him to be the leader of the senate majority anymore because
[03:52:53.600 --> 03:53:00.080]  he is not able to get any of this stuff passed he is not able to get any of these bills passed
[03:53:00.080 --> 03:53:04.720]  he's not able to get the agenda going so we launched the $5,000 contest and he said jack you
[03:53:04.720 --> 03:53:07.600]  know i thought you guys are supposed to be raising money what do you what are you giving money away
[03:53:07.600 --> 03:53:12.400]  for and i said look we started this group we're going to run it any way we want to so we originally
[03:53:12.400 --> 03:53:16.880]  had the end date of october 13th we've decided sort of collectively that we're going to move
[03:53:16.880 --> 03:53:22.400]  past that a little bit because there's so many great videos that have been coming in and i talked
[03:53:22.400 --> 03:53:28.160]  to the production staff over the break i've got one video that came in now we didn't make this
[03:53:28.160 --> 03:53:33.200]  we didn't uh ask someone to put this together we just said hey we're doing a ditch mitch contest
[03:53:33.200 --> 03:53:39.440]  and we want to see what you guys do so well because we saw the cnn as ices we saw the alex jones
[03:53:39.440 --> 03:53:45.040]  folk song video contest we wanted to see what we was out there because we know the creative
[03:53:45.040 --> 03:53:49.600]  abilities of so many people out there in this movement so we've got one video queued up and
[03:53:49.600 --> 03:53:54.000]  let's see if we can play that this uh this ditch mitch video that was uh submitted and they took
[03:53:54.000 --> 03:54:09.920]  a sort of a um a scene from the wizard of oz but changed it up in a very unique way we have that guys
[03:54:11.680 --> 03:54:19.120]  what did you do that for i didn't buy them what you tried to for spad enough picking on a strawman
[03:54:19.120 --> 03:54:23.680]  but when you go around picking on poor little dog well you didn't have to go and hit me did you
[03:54:25.520 --> 03:54:35.040]  is my nose bleeding off well of course not i haven't any courage at all i even scare myself
[03:54:37.360 --> 03:54:43.760]  don't you think the wizard could help him too i don't see why not why don't you come along with us
[03:54:43.760 --> 03:54:48.720]  we're on our way to see the wizard now to get him a heart and him a brain i'm sure he could
[03:54:48.720 --> 03:55:02.000]  give you some courage you gotta tell him silent freedom every time i see that it cracks me up
[03:55:02.000 --> 03:55:06.080]  especially because because we did when they go to mitch mcconnell and it's so perfect it's so
[03:55:06.080 --> 03:55:11.200]  perfectly encapsulates uh the issues that we have with our leadership mitch mcconnell sort of ringing
[03:55:11.200 --> 03:55:16.160]  his hands oh i haven't any courage at all and then and then it's uh john mccain of course and paul
[03:55:16.160 --> 03:55:21.200]  ryan we've got to get him a heart and him a brain and that isn't that exactly the issue that we've
[03:55:21.200 --> 03:55:26.880]  been having with our government lately uh to the people who made that meme uh solid green to
[03:55:26.880 --> 03:55:31.280]  replay on soiling green i really appreciate it again we haven't picked a winner yet so people
[03:55:31.280 --> 03:55:36.080]  want to go to revie team pack dot com they can go they can sign up if you want to submit anything
[03:55:36.080 --> 03:55:41.600]  to it all you have to do is go on twitter go on facebook go on youtube we've got all the different
[03:55:41.600 --> 03:55:47.600]  channels open do your ditch mitch video do your meme you can put it out there and i i want to see
[03:55:47.600 --> 03:55:52.320]  more of these i want to see more because i don't know i like them so much and it's amazing to think
[03:55:52.320 --> 03:56:00.080]  that we actually got just because of doing a contest online a social media contest social
[03:56:00.080 --> 03:56:07.280]  media driven we got the president of the united states and the senate majority leader to respond
[03:56:07.280 --> 03:56:11.120]  to us with mitch mcconnell saying very very cowardly line you can see one of the other ones
[03:56:11.120 --> 03:56:16.320]  there was sort of depicting as the sleepy turtle uh they actually came back and said to us they said
[03:56:16.320 --> 03:56:21.200]  please please stop please stop with the memes please stop with the videos we can't take it anymore
[03:56:21.200 --> 03:56:25.440]  we don't have any courage we can't we we i don't know what to do about this i don't know how to
[03:56:25.440 --> 03:56:33.440]  stop these people well here's a thought maybe instead of complaining about it maybe instead
[03:56:33.440 --> 03:56:40.560]  of telling us how much smarter than us you are maybe instead of talking down to us you actually
[03:56:40.560 --> 03:56:48.400]  listen what a concept listen to the people that elected donald trump listen to the people of this
[03:56:48.400 --> 03:56:55.600]  movement listen to our concerns listen to our policy ideas what we want the change that we

[03:57:00.800 --> 03:57:05.360]  when the leaders actually listen to the people and if i remember correctly oh yeah that word was
[03:57:05.360 --> 03:57:09.520]  called democracy and it's a little something that we used to have in the united states of america
[03:57:09.520 --> 03:57:13.600]  but a long time ago i don't know they kind of did away with that they did away with listening to the
[03:57:13.600 --> 03:57:18.960]  people and caring about what the people thought so we are going to have to remind them we're going
[03:57:18.960 --> 03:57:26.000]  to have to remind them each and every day that not only do we know what's going on but we are
[03:57:26.000 --> 03:57:31.520]  going to make ourselves heard and if you think you can ignore us then we are just going to be louder
