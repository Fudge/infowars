[00:00:04.119 --> 00:00:12.063]  Hard to believe it's already Monday, the 21st day of August 2017.
[00:00:12.063 --> 00:00:17.306]  But it is.
[00:00:17.306 --> 00:00:32.695]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy takeover.
[00:00:34.083 --> 00:00:36.130]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:43.784]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot make this up.
[00:00:43.784 --> 00:00:52.711]  The globalists must destroy the Renaissance and Western civilization that was all about overthrowing feudalism, because globalism is modern feudalism.
[00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:53.992]  That's what technocracy is.
[00:00:53.992 --> 00:01:01.638]  So all language, all symbols must be changed to be race-based, so that everyone can be manipulated against each other.
[00:01:01.638 --> 00:01:06.422]  It's like a mentally ill person, you know, seeing monsters in the clouds in the sky.
[00:01:06.422 --> 00:01:07.623]  The Atlantic has come out.
[00:01:08.163 --> 00:01:10.964]  And said that the eclipse is racist.
[00:01:10.964 --> 00:01:12.305]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:14.486]  We haven't seen one like it since 1776.
[00:01:14.486 --> 00:01:18.588]  Is it an omen of the rebirth of the republic?
[00:01:18.588 --> 00:01:19.469]  John Bowne reports.
[00:01:21.271 --> 00:01:26.175]  Eclipse of the Sun, visible today over North America for the last time in this century.
[00:01:26.175 --> 00:01:30.058]  Now from New York, here is correspondent Frank Reynolds.
[00:01:30.058 --> 00:01:30.738]  Good morning.
[00:01:30.738 --> 00:01:35.001]  This is indeed a special events broadcast of a genuine special event.
[00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:38.504]  The last total eclipse of the sun over the continent this century.
[00:01:38.504 --> 00:01:45.769]  The moon is moving between the sun and the earth and across a relatively narrow strip of the northwestern United States and central Canada.
[00:01:45.769 --> 00:01:50.172]  What you are seeing now is a picture taken from the Goldendale Observatory.
[00:01:51.113 --> 00:01:54.194]  And it is showing the eclipse of the sun over Portland, Oregon.
[00:01:54.194 --> 00:01:59.475]  It is approximately 75% or so of totality.
[00:01:59.475 --> 00:02:04.897]  In 13 minutes, it will be total over Portland, and we'll show you a fantastic sight then.
[00:02:04.897 --> 00:02:09.598]  When the skies darken across the United States, electric companies will face a massive challenge.
[00:02:09.598 --> 00:02:14.699]  How to avoid power disruptions and a post-eclipse surge that could cripple the nation.
[00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:16.780]  Another issue has to do with cell phones.
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.462]  Founding father Samuel Adams said numerous have been the manifestations of God's providence in sustaining us in the gloomy period of adversity and
[00:02:40.151 --> 00:02:43.892]  We have had our cloud by day and pillar of fire by night.
[00:02:43.892 --> 00:02:49.393]  We have been reduced to distress and the arm of omnipotence has raised us up.
[00:02:49.393 --> 00:02:59.055]  On August 21st, 2017, Providence will cover the continental United States of America as a total solar eclipse.
[00:02:59.055 --> 00:03:03.276]  Retired NASA astrophysicist and photographer Fred Espenak
[00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:04.276]  A.K.A.
[00:03:04.276 --> 00:03:21.004]  Mr. Eclipse told ABC the total solar eclipse on August 21st is particularly rare because it's the first time the path of totality exclusively crosses the continental United States from coast to coast since June 8th, 1918.
[00:03:21.004 --> 00:03:27.467]  It's also the first continent-wide eclipse to be visible only from the United States since...
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:33.440]  1776.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.303]  That's the really unique thing, Espenak told ABC News.
[00:03:38.303 --> 00:03:41.284]  It's not a particularly long total eclipse.
[00:03:41.284 --> 00:03:45.987]  It's not an especially wide path of totality, but it crosses the U.S.
[00:03:45.987 --> 00:03:47.288]  and no other country.
[00:03:47.288 --> 00:03:53.632]  The point of greatest eclipse is a point along the eclipse path that's determined by the axis of the moon's shadow.
[00:03:54.472 --> 00:04:09.138]  It's the instant when the axis of that shadow, if you could imagine that axis piercing the Earth as the Moon sweeps across the planet, it's the instant when that axis passes closest to the very center of the Earth.
[00:04:09.138 --> 00:04:17.641]  In terms of looking at the alignment of the Earth, Moon and Sun, it's when that alignment becomes as close as it's going to get during that particular eclipse.
[00:04:17.961 --> 00:04:40.497]  And as this epochal event, which has not been experienced since the year of the United States' birth in 1776, returns in its continental entirety, singling out the United States, it allows Americans to reflect on the stark contrast the bureaucratic federal government has become when compared to the days of the implementation of our founding principles.
[00:04:40.497 --> 00:04:43.679]  Liberals, isn't it obvious even the universe
[00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:45.140]  Disagrees with you.
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:55.044]  Will you order a Mueller special prosecution against the sun and the moon as you pointlessly shake your fist at the sky with all the puberous you can muster?
[00:04:55.044 --> 00:04:58.465]  John Bowne reporting for Infowars.com.
[00:04:58.465 --> 00:04:59.166]  Powerful!
[00:05:01.307 --> 00:05:02.729]  Why is the fungus?
[00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:03.810]  Why is the mold?
[00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.551]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[00:05:05.551 --> 00:05:06.532]  What is going on?
[00:05:06.532 --> 00:05:07.293]  What has changed?
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:22.905]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:24.686]  It's available at infomerestore.com.

[00:05:33.012 --> 00:05:34.033]  I want to get your reviews.
[00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:34.993]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:05:34.993 --> 00:05:36.454]  For me, it's been incredible.
[00:05:36.454 --> 00:05:40.977]  MycoZX, anti-fungal, anti-fungus, anti-yeast.
[00:05:40.977 --> 00:05:41.697]  Get it today.
[00:05:41.697 --> 00:05:42.278]  Limited run.

[00:05:43.698 --> 00:05:48.341]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:51.683]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[00:05:51.683 --> 00:05:54.025]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[00:05:54.025 --> 00:05:55.426]  Look at the response we're getting.
[00:05:55.426 --> 00:05:57.367]  We're changing the world together.
[00:05:57.367 --> 00:05:58.387]  You are the InfoWar.
[00:05:58.387 --> 00:05:59.148]  God bless you all.
[00:06:01.298 --> 00:06:06.761]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:06:06.761 --> 00:06:08.862]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:06:08.862 --> 00:06:14.145]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:06:14.145 --> 00:06:17.667]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[00:06:17.987 --> 00:06:21.429]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:24.632]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[00:06:24.632 --> 00:06:28.494]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[00:06:28.494 --> 00:06:35.659]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:41.063]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[00:06:41.323 --> 00:06:43.365]  Iodine, nano, silver, and more.
[00:06:43.365 --> 00:06:51.655]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is Spearmint free.
[00:06:51.655 --> 00:06:59.985]  Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at InfoWarsLife.com and support the InfoWars while you support healthy gums and teeth.

[00:08:07.804 --> 00:08:12.187]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:12.187 --> 00:08:18.011]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:57.765]  It's hard to believe that there has not been a total eclipse of the sun by the moon that sweeps across the United States, across North America since 1776.
[00:08:57.765 --> 00:09:00.929]  It was seen by the founders as providence.
[00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:20.756]  And as a sign, but undoubtedly, ladies and gentlemen, the social engineers that wish to steal the secret of the Renaissance transmute, through their satanic alchemy, everything into a race-based, mindless, idiotic system.
[00:09:22.016 --> 00:09:23.497]  The story's from the Daily Caller.
[00:09:23.497 --> 00:09:30.081]  It is reporting on the Atlantic Monthly, one of the top globalist anti-human publications.
[00:09:30.081 --> 00:09:33.844]  The folks are trying to organize a violent coup of the president.
[00:09:33.844 --> 00:09:46.351]  The eclipse is racist because it fails to affect enough black people, the Atlantic suggests, as if the elites and the billionaires care about anybody but themselves.
[00:09:46.351 --> 00:09:48.513]  But then everything is this virtue signal
[00:09:50.086 --> 00:09:53.927]  As they hobble the minds of the public.
[00:09:53.927 --> 00:10:04.871]  Last night, Owen Schroyer had seen on the news that they had just announced they were going to take down Confederate statues at the University of Texas overnight.
[00:10:04.871 --> 00:10:14.373]  And so he went down there, and there are two lengthy videos on Infowars.com that are expletive laden.
[00:10:14.373 --> 00:10:15.894]  And if you were white down there,
[00:10:17.335 --> 00:10:18.836]  And you're trying to cover it.
[00:10:18.836 --> 00:10:22.840]  People march over and say, why are you here?
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.122]  And Ellen says, well, I'm a journalist.
[00:10:25.122 --> 00:10:29.786]  This is very interesting that in the dead of night they're removing these.
[00:10:29.786 --> 00:10:39.674]  And then the people start screaming, we hate America and start chanting death to America and screaming and howling and freaking out.
[00:10:39.674 --> 00:10:42.837]  And you hear the hysterical voices
[00:10:44.255 --> 00:10:54.057]  On these tapes we're gonna be playing, Owen's gonna be in studio at the bottom of the hour, and it is just mental illness.
[00:10:54.057 --> 00:10:58.658]  My ancestors were persecuted by these people!
[00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:07.119]  I mean, I could dig back and find anything you can want has gone on to my ancestors, and I, like, feel some psychic wound, and I'm a loser, and then you're guilty.
[00:11:07.119 --> 00:11:09.880]  This is total scientific hobbling.
[00:11:12.605 --> 00:11:19.087]  This is people having their Achilles tendons culturally sliced.
[00:11:19.087 --> 00:11:23.088]  So that you're just a walking basket case.
[00:11:23.088 --> 00:11:24.449]  Look at what Charles Barkley said.
[00:11:24.449 --> 00:11:29.891]  He said, I don't even know who these people are on these statues and never even hardly seen one or been affected by it.
[00:11:29.891 --> 00:11:33.512]  Quit letting people manipulate you into stirring up a fight.
[00:11:33.512 --> 00:11:38.273]  That's all this is.
[00:11:38.273 --> 00:11:39.694]  Is a bunch of craziness.
[00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:46.634]  And then people pulling him down think they're like defeating somebody.
[00:11:46.634 --> 00:11:53.322]  This is all part of the power structure wanting to set the precedent to be able to remove whatever they want, whenever they want.
[00:11:53.322 --> 00:11:58.628]  And of course now they're going after Thomas Jefferson and George Washington.
[00:12:00.026 --> 00:12:03.567]  It doesn't matter, they were born into a system that was going on all over the world.
[00:12:03.567 --> 00:12:10.369]  It doesn't matter that England, and then Europe, and then the United States, led the world in ending slavery.
[00:12:10.369 --> 00:12:27.075]  You go to college, or you watch TV, you'd never know that, even though it's a scientific fact that the UK, back then England, the British Empire, went to war with more than 50 countries to end the slave trade.
[00:12:29.178 --> 00:12:35.863]  We had a war in 1812 with them over it.
[00:12:35.863 --> 00:12:41.227]  But you'd think over in England that they'd teach them over there that they invented slavery.
[00:12:41.227 --> 00:12:45.671]  Hell, the Britons used to be slaves under the Romans.
[00:12:45.671 --> 00:12:48.753]  Total upside down, crazy town world.
[00:12:52.145 --> 00:13:09.699]  And you've got a bunch of people going to college being given worthless degrees for worthless futures and they psychologically poison them and they psychologically brainwash them where you're not getting a real degree for a real future because the future doesn't need you.
[00:13:09.699 --> 00:13:11.600]  The robots are taking over.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.301]  That's all admitted.
[00:13:13.223 --> 00:13:24.325]  But first we've got to disease your mind with a chip on your shoulder where all you see is racial stuff where all over the United States they've banned the term Lynch off of halls, libraries, you name it.
[00:13:24.325 --> 00:13:33.447]  And then they're even talking about not letting folks be on the faculty named Lynch because it's an Irish name.
[00:13:33.447 --> 00:13:41.809]  There was the Lynch trials 200 plus years ago where a father and son hung the other son because they thought he committed a crime.
[00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:48.377]  There was a famous trial called the Lynch Trial.
[00:13:48.377 --> 00:13:52.021]  I mean, if somebody's got the last name Simpson, that's associated with OJ trial.
[00:13:52.021 --> 00:13:53.362]  You ban the name Simpson.
[00:13:53.362 --> 00:13:56.887]  This is banning words catering to the mental illness.
[00:13:56.887 --> 00:13:59.470]  Oh, we got Play-Doh for you to come play with.
[00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.754]  If you're upset, you hear about the Constitution.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:12.402]  We've got videos at colleges where folks see a Constitution and they get so triggered they go in and cry and they say, come in here, we have Play-Doh for you.
[00:14:12.402 --> 00:14:22.883]  We have colors, we have crayons, and you sit there at a little table that's a foot high with your legs crossed like a baby and they go, aren't you a good mental patient?
[00:14:22.883 --> 00:14:27.184]  So Atlantic Monthly and others are saying it's racist.
[00:14:27.184 --> 00:14:28.605]  The Eclipse is racist.
[00:14:28.605 --> 00:14:30.605]  Just everything has to be hijacked
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:42.665]  With garbage, American blackout, a tour of the solar eclipse path reveals a nation that fought to maintain a different sort of totality.
[00:14:42.665 --> 00:14:44.225]  What?
[00:14:44.225 --> 00:14:56.051]  Meanwhile, because they're teaching people that see the imaginary racism everywhere, then have chips on your shoulders, then wonder why folks are scared of you or don't want to work with you, and then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:14:58.536 --> 00:15:03.218]  It's like a schizophrenic seeing the clouds and thinking there are monsters coming to get them.
[00:15:03.218 --> 00:15:09.241]  One time I had a homeless person stumble up to me on the street and say, look, look, it's following me!
[00:15:09.241 --> 00:15:13.964]  And it was the sun, and there's more of them, was pointing at clouds.
[00:15:13.964 --> 00:15:18.826]  This person was a full-on schizophrenic out of their bonkers mind.
[00:15:18.826 --> 00:15:20.107]  Same deal.
[00:15:20.107 --> 00:15:21.628]  But they're imposing it.
[00:15:21.628 --> 00:15:25.309]  Colorado man stabbed because of his neo-Nazi haircut.
[00:15:25.309 --> 00:15:26.110]  Look, even
[00:15:27.762 --> 00:15:31.646]  Yahoo legitimizes it well, like maybe he deserves it.
[00:15:31.646 --> 00:15:32.987]  New York Post got it right.
[00:15:32.987 --> 00:15:36.450]  Man stabbed at a haircut, gets him mistaken for a neo-Nazi.
[00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:40.074]  He pulls up at a fast food place to go in and get a shake.
[00:15:40.074 --> 00:15:41.615]  Shake and steak.
[00:15:41.615 --> 00:15:43.717]  In Denver, Colorado.
[00:15:43.717 --> 00:15:48.281]  And a guy runs up screaming, you're one of them Nazis.
[00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:52.806]  And tries to stab him in the neck, but he blocks it and almost chops his fingers off.
[00:15:55.441 --> 00:15:59.222]  And then I saw people on Twitter going, yeah, kill him, he deserves it.
[00:15:59.222 --> 00:16:06.284]  Doesn't matter that most of the basketball players you see who happen to be black have the same haircut or David Beckham or anybody else.
[00:16:06.284 --> 00:16:07.144]  It doesn't matter.
[00:16:07.144 --> 00:16:14.406]  You need to find that racism in the eclipse, in a guy's short haircut, in whatever it is.
[00:16:14.406 --> 00:16:15.767]  You've got to find it.
[00:16:15.767 --> 00:16:17.347]  It's got to be there.
[00:16:17.347 --> 00:16:24.629]  So that's why I've issued a travel advisory for the United States for white folks going to places like Denver, Detroit,
[00:16:26.442 --> 00:16:29.985]  Places like Chicago.
[00:16:29.985 --> 00:16:31.927]  Places like Seattle.
[00:16:31.927 --> 00:16:34.009]  Because I've been to these towns and I've experienced it.
[00:16:34.009 --> 00:16:36.252]  I've got some of the statistics here.
[00:16:36.252 --> 00:16:41.517]  Black Lives Matter supporters have to grapple with this chart.
[00:16:41.517 --> 00:16:42.438]  And it shows that
[00:16:43.766 --> 00:16:47.630]  I kept saying 10 times more likely for whites to be attacked by blacks.
[00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.071]  That's a watered down number.
[00:16:49.071 --> 00:16:53.475]  It's 25 times more likely, according to the Bureau of Statistics and the FBI.
[00:16:53.475 --> 00:16:59.661]  25 times more likely if you're white to be attacked by a black person than vice versa.
[00:16:59.661 --> 00:17:03.645]  You can just type into Google before they change this, I'm sure.
[00:17:05.393 --> 00:17:09.115]  Black on white crime, and we'll put up some of those graphics.
[00:17:09.115 --> 00:17:14.698]  25 to 1 physical attack, homicides.
[00:17:14.698 --> 00:17:16.579]  Blacks killed by whites, 2%.
[00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:18.740]  Blacks killed by police, 1%.
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:19.780]  Whites killed by police, 3%.
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:20.821]  Whites killed by whites, 16%.
[00:17:20.821 --> 00:17:21.561]  Whites killed by blacks, 81%.
[00:17:21.561 --> 00:17:23.022]  Of whites killed is by blacks.
[00:17:23.022 --> 00:17:24.062]  Blacks killed by blacks, 97%.
[00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:37.811]  Those statistics are from 2015.
[00:17:37.811 --> 00:17:40.272]  They're always two years behind.
[00:17:40.272 --> 00:17:42.212]  And this was not happening 50 years ago.
[00:17:42.212 --> 00:17:51.156]  In fact, illegitimacy in the black community in most areas was lower than the white areas, because they were predominantly very serious Christians.
[00:17:51.156 --> 00:17:55.938]  But they brought the social engineers in, in the 50s and 60s, the Democratic Party did.
[00:17:55.938 --> 00:18:00.780]  You know, I love how the Democrats are acting like Republicans have these Democrat Party people.
[00:18:01.923 --> 00:18:04.525]  Whose statues are being pulled down all over the country.
[00:18:04.525 --> 00:18:08.868]  I mean, it doesn't matter if it's Robert E. Lee or you're trying to pull down Thomas Jefferson.
[00:18:08.868 --> 00:18:15.433]  I mean, those are Democratic Party icons.
[00:18:15.433 --> 00:18:25.421]  I love how you got blacks running around yelling and screaming as the media told them to with a bunch of white knight race pushers.
[00:18:25.421 --> 00:18:29.985]  When you don't have any blacks living that ever even saw slavery, you've got all these whites who were never connected to it.
[00:18:31.209 --> 00:18:42.437]  And then you've got the Democratic Party that is literally pushing this, that's removing their history, and then somehow that's all Donald Trump's fault.
[00:18:42.437 --> 00:18:45.879]  In fact, I tweeted that out this morning, that point.
[00:18:45.879 --> 00:18:47.660]  I noticed a lot of other people making.
[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:51.603]  It's just total hype, hysteria, mental illness.
[00:18:54.741 --> 00:18:56.002]  And the statistics are all there.
[00:18:56.002 --> 00:19:02.149]  I mean, there needs to be reparations for white people in the last 20, 30 years getting attacked and killed by the tens of thousands every year.
[00:19:03.291 --> 00:19:08.154]  Seriously, if you want to play this whole game, and I'm not actually asking for that, there needs to be real travel advisories.
[00:19:08.154 --> 00:19:14.539]  They used to have in the 60s in some places like Selma, Alabama, the New York Times would put travel advisories out for black folks.
[00:19:14.539 --> 00:19:15.139]  Well, you know what?
[00:19:15.139 --> 00:19:16.240]  They needed a travel advisory.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:16.861]  That's true.
[00:19:16.861 --> 00:19:19.102]  But we need real travel advisories now.
[00:19:19.102 --> 00:19:26.847]  The white folks need to understand that there is the promotion and the pushing of you being mugged, you being killed by the new Black Panther Party and everybody else.
[00:19:27.668 --> 00:19:33.973]  They're saying, go out and kill a white person, go out and mug a white person, go out and commit crime in their neighborhoods, because they deserve it.
[00:19:33.973 --> 00:19:45.801]  And you got a bunch of moral justice warrior, social justice warrior, virtue signaling white people that are so whacked out of their brains.
[00:19:45.801 --> 00:19:51.845]  When I was in Seattle, I couldn't walk 30 feet without running up and screaming, F you Nazi, and then running.
[00:19:51.845 --> 00:19:57.089]  Because they're such cowards, but they act like a body snatcher cult.
[00:20:00.131 --> 00:20:05.254]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[00:20:05.254 --> 00:20:10.957]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[00:20:10.957 --> 00:20:16.160]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.

[00:24:31.715 --> 00:24:31.955]  What's up?
[00:25:13.022 --> 00:25:18.707]  This is a mainstream media created, contrived, mass mental illness.
[00:25:18.707 --> 00:25:22.950]  You've got Boston, a super liberal city that the globalists completely control.
[00:25:24.793 --> 00:25:28.734]  You've got all the supposed minorities basically getting free educations.
[00:25:28.734 --> 00:25:33.395]  Once they get there to get the education, though, they're just turned into victims.
[00:25:33.395 --> 00:25:44.837]  And then you've got a free speech rally that's held by a diverse group, and then you have 10,000 plus people come out to protest free speech, calling it KKK.
[00:25:44.837 --> 00:25:53.299]  You've got old white people and old women being beaten up by mobs of mainly white meth heads with a few black people sprinkled in.
[00:25:54.392 --> 00:26:01.878]  Screaming that everyone's a Nazi as they grab American flags away from people and beat them up.
[00:26:01.878 --> 00:26:10.806]  Because they're looking for the mythical Nazi and they're all supposed to be Captain America battling Red Skull.
[00:26:10.806 --> 00:26:16.230]  And so I'd be walking along in Seattle and a lot of people saw it on live feeds.
[00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:20.434]  People would run up screaming and yelling going, F you Nazi!
[00:26:20.434 --> 00:26:23.136]  And then run in fear in almost every case.
[00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:29.991]  A few times I'd try to run after somebody saying, talk to me, talk to me.
[00:26:29.991 --> 00:26:33.792]  They'd say, F you Nazi!
[00:26:33.792 --> 00:26:48.576]  Last night we were about to leave at about 8 o'clock because our flight was at 11.30 out of Seattle and Michael Zimmerman, our rooms were close to each other and we had taken the bags from one room and put it in another where they were giving us a real late checkout.
[00:26:48.576 --> 00:26:49.636]  We're all in there in the room together.
[00:26:50.606 --> 00:26:52.067]  And I said, I'm sick of the hotel food.
[00:26:52.067 --> 00:26:53.828]  I'm going to walk 200 yards to this place and eat.
[00:26:53.828 --> 00:26:56.050]  And he goes, man, I don't think that's a good idea.
[00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:57.851]  I'm staying here and I'm eating.
[00:26:57.851 --> 00:26:58.972]  I think we really pushed it.
[00:26:58.972 --> 00:27:01.794]  And I said, oh, come on.
[00:27:01.794 --> 00:27:03.094]  So he stays there.
[00:27:03.094 --> 00:27:07.177]  I go with my wife down.
[00:27:07.177 --> 00:27:11.220]  And I'm coming out last night at about 7.30 because we had to leave at 8.
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:14.302]  I got 200 yards to walk down to the hotel.
[00:27:14.302 --> 00:27:15.163]  There's nobody on the street.
[00:27:16.004 --> 00:27:23.068]  And I'm walking, and there's a parking garage right here, and there's a Range Rover punching its ticket and driving out.
[00:27:23.068 --> 00:27:26.731]  And I can't see because it's still light outside, and there's light on it.
[00:27:26.731 --> 00:27:33.775]  I was about to walk, and then I just waited, and I waved them past, and they just sat there.
[00:27:33.775 --> 00:27:40.599]  So I start stepping out, and the Range Rover hits the gas like it's going to run me over.
[00:27:40.599 --> 00:27:41.620]  And I just step back.
[00:27:43.203 --> 00:27:44.964]  And I go, oh my gosh, it's one of them.
[00:27:44.964 --> 00:27:47.386]  So I start walking across after he drives out.
[00:27:47.386 --> 00:27:51.870]  He rolls down his window and he goes, F you, Alex Jones.
[00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:54.872]  And he's some tatted up, wannabe, you know, tough guy.
[00:27:54.872 --> 00:28:01.057]  And he's got his girlfriend, looks pretty upset, the passenger side, because he's pulling around, looking at me, he's like 10 feet away, or less.
[00:28:01.057 --> 00:28:04.980]  And I just said, listen, coward.
[00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:06.822]  You better watch it.
[00:28:06.822 --> 00:28:08.963]  He goes, F you, fag.
[00:28:10.049 --> 00:28:13.811]  And I said, listen man, you're the one that's just acting like you're going to run over me.
[00:28:13.811 --> 00:28:15.152]  He goes, oh yeah, you want me to get out?
[00:28:15.152 --> 00:28:16.692]  I said, just do whatever you want to, man.
[00:28:16.692 --> 00:28:17.813]  I said, yeah, you're a coward.
[00:28:17.813 --> 00:28:21.475]  You're not getting out of that car.
[00:28:21.475 --> 00:28:22.795]  Meanwhile, my wife's standing right here.
[00:28:22.795 --> 00:28:24.256]  I just looked at him.
[00:28:24.256 --> 00:28:34.201]  And he starts driving away, the same way I'm going, in his car, going, F you, F you, you faggot, you homosexual, you cocksucker.
[00:28:34.201 --> 00:28:35.282]  This is what he's doing, and I'm
[00:28:36.491 --> 00:28:41.434]  So jazzed up, I'm not even getting my phone out, because I'm just getting ready for him to get out of the car.
[00:28:41.434 --> 00:28:46.737]  And he drove off, but I mean, these people are the literal scum of the earth.
[00:28:46.737 --> 00:28:48.218]  This is a white guy.
[00:28:48.218 --> 00:28:50.500]  And it was frothing white guys.
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:53.321]  It was like their coming of age.
[00:28:53.321 --> 00:29:02.227]  Before that, the reason Zimmerman said you probably shouldn't go out, was it was about 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock, the Sunday show had just ended, it was two hours ahead.
[00:29:03.294 --> 00:29:08.859]  And I went down to check on him at a later checkout, and there was 50 floors in the building.
[00:29:08.859 --> 00:29:12.442]  We were on the 40th floor.
[00:29:12.442 --> 00:29:19.848]  And so I hit that I was going to go down, but another guy was coming up.
[00:29:19.848 --> 00:29:26.554]  And so the door opens, another guy gets on, and I see as the doors open this guy with his wife and like six-year-old son bows up.
[00:29:28.021 --> 00:29:29.481]  And I thought, is he doing something with his kid?
[00:29:29.481 --> 00:29:32.262]  And then as the doors closed, he goes, F you, Alex Jones!
[00:29:32.262 --> 00:29:34.883]  He waited until the doors closed to do it.
[00:29:34.883 --> 00:29:36.783]  Another white guy with a handlebar mustache.
[00:29:36.783 --> 00:29:38.984]  I mean, the cowardice of these people.
[00:29:38.984 --> 00:29:40.844]  But they hate America.
[00:29:40.844 --> 00:29:46.226]  And we come back, we have them chanting last night.
[00:29:46.226 --> 00:29:47.926]  Down with America, we hate America.
[00:29:47.926 --> 00:29:49.406]  In Austin, we have them.
[00:29:49.406 --> 00:29:53.267]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.267 --> 00:29:55.948]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.016 --> 00:30:02.437]  Why is the fungus?
[00:30:02.437 --> 00:30:03.518]  Why is the mold?
[00:30:03.518 --> 00:30:05.259]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[00:30:05.259 --> 00:30:06.220]  What is going on?
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:06.980]  What has changed?
[00:30:31.276 --> 00:30:32.716]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[00:30:32.716 --> 00:30:34.697]  I want to get your reviews on here, what you have to say.
[00:30:34.697 --> 00:30:36.137]  For me, it's been incredible.
[00:30:36.137 --> 00:30:40.678]  MycoZX, anti-fungal, anti-fungus, anti-yeast.
[00:30:40.678 --> 00:30:41.498]  Get it today.
[00:30:41.498 --> 00:30:42.018]  Limited run.

[00:30:43.398 --> 00:30:48.059]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:30:48.059 --> 00:30:51.400]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.720]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.620]  Look at the response we're getting.
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.061]  We're changing the world together.
[00:30:57.061 --> 00:30:58.081]  You are the InfoWar.
[00:30:58.081 --> 00:30:58.821]  God bless you all.
[00:31:00.521 --> 00:31:09.267]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[00:31:09.267 --> 00:31:09.787]  That's right.
[00:31:09.787 --> 00:31:15.051]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rites freeze dryers.

[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:29.560]  Woo!
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:30.581]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:31:30.581 --> 00:31:39.326]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[00:31:39.326 --> 00:31:48.932]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[00:31:48.932 --> 00:31:52.374]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[00:31:52.374 --> 00:31:56.476]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.

[00:33:20.373 --> 00:33:30.721]  From the front lines... From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:33.607 --> 00:33:34.768]  I have a correction to make.
[00:33:34.768 --> 00:33:44.732]  Last segment I said Antifa was chanting, alt-left's really what they are, was chanting here in Austin, Texas last night at UT, down with America.
[00:33:44.732 --> 00:33:48.054]  I'm sorry, they're chanting death to America.
[00:33:48.054 --> 00:33:49.895]  So it was worse than I was saying.
[00:33:49.895 --> 00:33:51.036]  I have to make that correction.
[00:33:51.036 --> 00:33:51.496]  Normally when I...
[00:33:52.116 --> 00:33:55.378]  When I make mistakes, it's that I'm not seeing how bad it actually is.
[00:33:55.378 --> 00:34:03.361]  Owen Troyer went down there by himself in the middle of the night last night, because they just announced last night, we're going to pull down the Confederate statues in the middle of the night.
[00:34:03.361 --> 00:34:14.466]  So he went down there and he sure enough got video of it and had folks, because he was white, coming over and saying, what the hell are you doing here?
[00:34:14.466 --> 00:34:16.487]  And there's so much cussing and so many threats.
[00:34:16.487 --> 00:34:19.569]  The raw video is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:21.351 --> 00:34:33.556]  It's like a cult, because when I was in Seattle, the first few days, a lot of folks were listeners, a lot of people liked the show.
[00:34:33.556 --> 00:34:45.622]  But after they announced I was in town in the newspaper and on TV, people would come over, throw hot coffee on me, cuss at me, act like they were going to hit me with cars, just yell and scream.
[00:34:45.622 --> 00:34:47.763]  But then in every case, but in the case of the Goblin,
[00:34:48.717 --> 00:34:50.658]  Which we've got to actually give him honors.
[00:34:50.658 --> 00:34:52.800]  The guy that threw hot coffee on me.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.961]  They would all run.
[00:34:54.961 --> 00:34:59.104]  They would come over and say F you Nazi and then they would run.
[00:34:59.104 --> 00:35:03.346]  Or they would say F you and then jump on an elevator or as it closed in front of their kids.
[00:35:03.346 --> 00:35:07.009]  And this one guy was waiting with his car and acted like he was going to run me over.
[00:35:07.009 --> 00:35:13.533]  And then was laughing at me calling me a pejorative term, a fag.
[00:35:13.533 --> 00:35:14.313]  And a, you know,
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:20.221]  Peter Puffer and all these other terms, and it's just, it's crazy.
[00:35:20.221 --> 00:35:21.642]  They're like trash.
[00:35:21.642 --> 00:35:25.543]  Liberals are uneducated, dumb, trash.
[00:35:25.543 --> 00:35:26.403]  They're lazy.
[00:35:26.403 --> 00:35:37.847]  All the statistics show, what is it, six times more likely to steal, nine times more likely not to give to charity, but something like 14 times more likely, depending on the study, to signal that they're giving to charity.
[00:35:37.847 --> 00:35:43.509]  I mean, they're just a bunch of scum, and it really hit me that there's no good values with these people.
[00:35:45.014 --> 00:35:49.877]  They have just degenerated to the absolute scum of the earth.
[00:35:49.877 --> 00:35:54.280]  The video is Alt-Left Chants Death to America in Austin, Texas.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.442]  It just went up a few hours ago, Owen.
[00:35:56.442 --> 00:35:57.422]  Probably need a bigger crew.
[00:35:57.422 --> 00:35:59.724]  You're out there by yourself in the middle of the night.
[00:35:59.724 --> 00:36:00.524]  Tell us what happened.
[00:36:00.524 --> 00:36:11.051]  We're going to play some of this heavily bleeped stuff where these people are just hysterical that whites are hunting them down, whites are killing them, even though I have the FBI crime statistics.
[00:36:12.051 --> 00:36:16.532]  Even the Washington Post says, aren't more white people than black people killed by police?
[00:36:16.532 --> 00:36:17.532]  Yes.
[00:36:17.532 --> 00:36:23.573]  And then we have the admissions that Black Lives Matter supporters have to grapple with this chart.
[00:36:23.573 --> 00:36:29.234]  And it's that they're 25 times more likely to kill a white person than a white person to kill a black person.
[00:36:29.234 --> 00:36:36.536]  And cops are twice as likely, per capita, not just that whites are a larger population, to kill a white person.
[00:36:36.536 --> 00:36:37.676]  They actually respond
[00:36:38.792 --> 00:36:47.180]  A slow roll to many of the areas in Chicago and other areas where 3,000 plus people are shot a year, 97% of it by other blacks.
[00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:49.082]  These are real numbers!
[00:36:49.082 --> 00:36:59.832]  And the thing is, I really want to empower people, but it's such a peer pressure system and things are so racist now that I've had to issue... So I've looked at the numbers.
[00:36:59.832 --> 00:37:01.794]  If you get one or two tourists killed in Mexico,
[00:37:02.891 --> 00:37:08.877]  In a state of Mexico, in even a six month period, they will issue a travel advisory for that state.
[00:37:08.877 --> 00:37:12.640]  Say Oaxaca or Chihuahua or wherever.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:18.225]  If it starts happening every few weeks, they'll issue it for the whole country of Mexico.
[00:37:18.225 --> 00:37:24.731]  But you literally have whites everywhere getting stabbed, killed, murdered, knockout gamed every day.
[00:37:25.831 --> 00:37:31.575]  Twenty-five white people are killed for every black person that's killed by a white person.
[00:37:31.575 --> 00:37:34.236]  And the main black groups are saying, kill white people.
[00:37:34.236 --> 00:37:36.338]  You know, we don't want you virtue signaling white people.
[00:37:36.338 --> 00:37:38.099]  You don't need to be white allies.
[00:37:38.099 --> 00:37:42.242]  These sick, weird, college brain damage terms.
[00:37:42.242 --> 00:37:45.664]  You know, you keep your mouth shut is what the black magazines are saying.
[00:37:45.664 --> 00:37:47.465]  I mean, I don't owe anybody anything.
[00:37:47.465 --> 00:37:48.846]  I haven't done anything.
[00:37:48.846 --> 00:37:51.348]  I'm not stooping down to your black KKK level.
[00:37:52.188 --> 00:37:58.273]  I'm not run by the Democratic Party and all your race-based, dirty, lowdown, scum garbage.
[00:37:58.273 --> 00:37:59.954]  I transcend you.
[00:37:59.954 --> 00:38:14.564]  And I'm going to march through your communist-held areas, and I'm going to get in your face, and I'm going to issue travel advisories, and I'm going to rally the troops of every race, color, and creed who want free market liberty and who don't want to live in Venezuela or North Korea.
[00:38:14.564 --> 00:38:17.527]  Colorado man stabbed because of his Nazi haircut.
[00:38:17.527 --> 00:38:19.028]  Yahoo acts like he deserves it!
[00:38:21.493 --> 00:38:24.455]  Gets out of his car to go get some fast food.
[00:38:24.455 --> 00:38:27.858]  Guy runs up screaming, you're a Nazi, you're a Nazi, you look like a Nazi.
[00:38:27.858 --> 00:38:31.561]  Starts stabbing him.
[00:38:31.561 --> 00:38:34.964]  Starts trying to stab him in the neck.
[00:38:34.964 --> 00:38:41.229]  Meanwhile, the total eclipse of the sun has begun in Oregon, the prime place to see 99% of it.
[00:38:41.229 --> 00:38:41.569]  And what does?
[00:38:44.437 --> 00:38:54.548]  What does the Atlantic Monthly, elite publication, when I say elite, they're the ones that, you know, call for re-education camps and taking your guns and overthrowing Trump and how to install a new government.
[00:38:54.548 --> 00:38:58.252]  The Eclipse is racist because it fails to affect enough black people.
[00:39:00.325 --> 00:39:07.388]  The Atlantic suggests, still an eclipse chaser is always tempted to believe that the skies are relaying a message.
[00:39:07.388 --> 00:39:09.609]  Talk about insanity.
[00:39:09.609 --> 00:39:18.313]  The Atlantic, a once great magazine, has determined that the total eclipse of the sun due to occur on Monday will fall and will fail to affect enough black people.
[00:39:18.313 --> 00:39:23.575]  The Atlantic's very lengthy essay, because to make it really lengthy on something insane, you know, it's true.
[00:39:24.807 --> 00:39:35.873]  On the failure of the eclipse to occur where a significant number of black people reside, entitled American Blackout, it clocks in at a remarkable 4,544 words and does not appear to be satire.
[00:39:40.063 --> 00:39:52.352]  Concerning the great American eclipse, Brooklyn law professor Alice Ristroff writes that the rapidly deteriorating magazine, there lived almost no black people along most of its path.
[00:39:52.352 --> 00:40:02.940]  The Atlantic's long-winded law professor argues, readers, that implicit bias of the solar system is presumably not the cause of the eclipse's failure to affect enough black people.
[00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:13.538]  Again, this is the game where everything is attributed to race, and it just becomes an entire mental illness compendium.
[00:40:13.538 --> 00:40:15.180]  But we've got some of the audio.
[00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:19.184]  Owen, tell us about what time this happened in the middle of the night, what you witnessed.
[00:40:19.184 --> 00:40:24.610]  I mean, the video's up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com right now and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:40:26.992 --> 00:40:28.414]  Again, people think this is insane.
[00:40:28.414 --> 00:40:30.337]  This is how you overthrow a country.
[00:40:30.337 --> 00:40:42.195]  If you've got the West challenging slavery, challenging monopolies, challenging feudalism, challenging serfdom, delivering incredible 95% of the inventions, a giant middle class for the first time in history,
[00:40:42.735 --> 00:40:52.778]  Christian societies, open societies, bringing in all sorts of people, fusing them together in a great, true, diverse melting pot of judging people on the character of their deeds, on the color of their skin.
[00:40:52.778 --> 00:40:54.098]  How do you invert that?
[00:40:54.098 --> 00:40:55.818]  Well, you see what they've done.
[00:40:55.818 --> 00:41:01.260]  What Black Lives Matter and all these Soros-funded groups do and the liberation theology is purposeful!
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:14.135]  Purposeful to hobble the mind, to handicap the mind, and to turn us into the most divided nation the planet has ever seen with the elite manipulating and controlling it.
[00:41:14.135 --> 00:41:19.882]  So you just read some tripe from the Atlantic that says the implicit bias of the solar system
[00:41:20.802 --> 00:41:23.343]  That's so insane, I can't even believe I have to address it.
[00:41:23.343 --> 00:41:36.947]  So what happens is last night, I catch similar tripe being published about how University of Texas is going to remove the Robert E. Lee statue from in front of Benedict Hall, a very popular, a very... It just suddenly gets announced hours before!
[00:41:37.387 --> 00:41:43.110]  And so I get down there probably around 1230, 1245 last night, and they're already removing it.
[00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:43.870]  There's a police line.
[00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:46.671]  You can't even come within 100 yards of these things.
[00:41:46.671 --> 00:41:48.692]  And there's a group of some protesters out there.
[00:41:48.692 --> 00:41:50.193]  There's a bunch of media out there.
[00:41:51.266 --> 00:41:58.555]  And I'll get to that in a second, but here's the unbelievable statement, really, that I think people should be concerned about.
[00:41:58.555 --> 00:42:09.148]  University of Texas President Greg Fenves says that they're removing the statue because, I quote, they are symbols of modern white supremacy and neo-Nazism.
[00:42:09.708 --> 00:42:15.891]  Okay, this is so historically inaccurate that you would think it's coming from a member of Antifa.
[00:42:15.891 --> 00:42:19.093]  No, this is coming from the President of the University of Texas.
[00:42:19.093 --> 00:42:21.574]  Robert E. Lee was the head of the Northern Army.
[00:42:21.574 --> 00:42:23.875]  He was the head of West Point.
[00:42:23.875 --> 00:42:32.679]  The Civil War had nothing to do with slavery until the very end, and that's why they now want Lincoln taken down, because he wrote in letters, if I could end this war and not free one slave, I'd do it.
[00:42:35.017 --> 00:42:37.638]  Before the country was founded, we're trying to get slavery banned.
[00:42:37.638 --> 00:42:43.359]  They'd gotten it banned in England and Europe before that, by about 1800 or so.
[00:42:43.359 --> 00:42:45.440]  And then they had laws out trying to stop it.
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:49.401]  So that was a backdrop, but they just create this whole mental illness.
[00:42:49.401 --> 00:42:50.801]  It has nothing to do with it.
[00:42:50.801 --> 00:42:53.922]  And then they say Robert E. Lee is a neo-Nazi.
[00:42:53.922 --> 00:42:55.583]  And now they're saying American flags.
[00:42:56.263 --> 00:42:57.784]  But they have got to be taken down too, though.
[00:42:57.784 --> 00:42:59.224]  Well, where is it going to stop?
[00:42:59.224 --> 00:43:02.606]  We got people to sign a petition to remove George Washington from the dollar bill.
[00:43:02.606 --> 00:43:04.647]  So, they don't know where... They'll go forever.
[00:43:04.647 --> 00:43:14.352]  These people, they're LARPing, they have no accomplishment in their life, they see a statue come down and they think this is them... Well, it's a manifestation of how they're trying to cause a civil war around this.
[00:43:14.352 --> 00:43:14.692]  Well, yeah.
[00:43:14.692 --> 00:43:17.773]  They failed all summer with the Summer of Rage, funded by Soros.
[00:43:17.773 --> 00:43:21.255]  Billions of dollars have been spent by these corporate groups.
[00:43:21.255 --> 00:43:25.277]  Apple, Google, all of them, come together and they all
[00:43:27.278 --> 00:43:33.339]  Put in tens of millions of dollars a month to literally create absolute breakdown of society and hysteria.
[00:43:33.339 --> 00:43:36.540]  But you went out there, described to folks what you witnessed, what you saw.
[00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:47.722]  Because the University of Texas, alma mater of my parents and a lot of family, you know, my granddad played football there with the first Dallas Cowboys coach, Tom Landry, the whole nine yards.
[00:43:47.722 --> 00:43:50.783]  So I like the University of Texas, but it's the front.
[00:43:51.443 --> 00:43:56.766]  Okay, it created the big conglomerates that bought up the radio stations, that then helped censor things.
[00:43:56.766 --> 00:44:00.268]  It's got offshore banks, hundreds of billions of dollars, billions in gold.
[00:44:00.268 --> 00:44:01.568]  It's nothing but a football team.
[00:44:01.568 --> 00:44:03.149]  Most of the degrees are worthless.
[00:44:03.149 --> 00:44:04.430]  Everything's overpriced.
[00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:07.131]  And they've just got a rearguard action while they're stealing billions.
[00:44:07.131 --> 00:44:09.192]  They're like, look, we took a statue down.
[00:44:09.192 --> 00:44:12.554]  Here, let's put communists on the review board.
[00:44:12.554 --> 00:44:14.215]  I mean, that's all this is.
[00:44:14.215 --> 00:44:15.556]  That's all Bill Gates.
[00:44:15.556 --> 00:44:17.037]  That's all Bezos.
[00:44:17.037 --> 00:44:19.618]  It's all any of them are doing is just getting us fighting with each other.
[00:44:19.758 --> 00:44:25.166]  So I get down there, like I said, around 12.30, 12.45, early this morning, late last night, however you want to say it.
[00:44:25.166 --> 00:44:31.475]  And I'm just filming, I'm approaching the thing, there's probably about 20 to 15 members of the media there.
[00:44:31.475 --> 00:44:34.940]  Nobody else is really reporting, most people are just shooting film, getting B-roll.
[00:44:35.501 --> 00:44:52.055]  I kind of walk past the line of media, I walk past the group of protesters, and I try to get close to the statue just to film it, and there's a little police blockade there, probably about 10 yards from the actual statue, and then there's about 100 to 150 yards of space in between that and the rest of the people.
[00:44:52.055 --> 00:44:54.156]  They won't even let you go on these stairs.
[00:44:54.156 --> 00:44:58.480]  These statues are so racist, you have to have a safe space of at least 100 yards so you can't even see them.
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:01.821]  So then I'm just standing there, much like you were doing in Seattle.
[00:45:01.821 --> 00:45:03.782]  I'm just standing there filing a report.
[00:45:03.782 --> 00:45:05.542]  I've got the news story in front of me.
[00:45:05.542 --> 00:45:06.343]  I'm breaking it down.
[00:45:06.343 --> 00:45:07.103]  I'm reading the headline.
[00:45:07.103 --> 00:45:08.804]  I'm reading from the story.
[00:45:08.804 --> 00:45:11.685]  And some people start to chime in.
[00:45:11.685 --> 00:45:13.445]  And then the usual tactics happen.
[00:45:13.445 --> 00:45:16.226]  A guy behind me says F you and starts flicking me off.
[00:45:16.226 --> 00:45:17.347]  They start calling me racist.
[00:45:17.347 --> 00:45:18.127]  The typical stuff.
[00:45:18.567 --> 00:45:21.210]  So I engage in a dialogue with these people.
[00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:23.492]  We have a conversation and it's the same thing.
[00:45:23.492 --> 00:45:26.795]  All they can say is F you, F this, F that, racist America.
[00:45:26.795 --> 00:45:28.577]  They've got their faces covered up.
[00:45:28.577 --> 00:45:30.959]  Yeah, and this woman has her face covered up.
[00:45:30.959 --> 00:45:33.541]  She's running around literally charging at people.
[00:45:33.541 --> 00:45:34.983]  She comes charging at me.
[00:45:34.983 --> 00:45:38.045]  She comes charging after this other guy who's just standing there filming.
[00:45:39.407 --> 00:45:41.669]  And they keep asking, why are you here?
[00:45:41.669 --> 00:45:42.609]  Get out of here.
[00:45:42.609 --> 00:45:44.291]  It's always this territorialism.
[00:45:44.291 --> 00:45:48.374]  Hey, we run things and we're going to get your paycheck and your kids belong to us.
[00:45:48.374 --> 00:45:51.057]  And then the woman starts screaming, I hate America.
[00:45:51.057 --> 00:45:54.480]  And they start chanting death to America.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:58.483]  I mean, but then they all want to get here as soon as possible.
[00:45:58.483 --> 00:46:00.145]  And then the elites are financing it.
[00:46:00.145 --> 00:46:01.986]  This is truly sick.
[00:46:01.986 --> 00:46:03.748]  The article's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:46:03.748 --> 00:46:05.950]  Alt-Left chants death to America.
[00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:13.795]  In Austin, Texas, BLM activists debate the takedown of Confederate monuments and declare their hate for America.
[00:46:13.795 --> 00:46:15.516]  This is happening in live time.
[00:46:15.516 --> 00:46:16.597]  Let's play an excerpt of it.
[00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:22.372]  Austin dozens of times, okay?
[00:46:22.372 --> 00:46:28.938]  So again, whatever about the statue, you want to take it down, you want to erase the history, I'm not going to civil war over a statue, okay?
[00:46:28.938 --> 00:46:34.183]  But they're not even having an intellectual debate, and these are the types of people that are deciding this future.
[00:46:34.183 --> 00:46:39.207]  These are the type of people that are deciding the fate of the University of Texas here in Austin.
[00:46:40.388 --> 00:46:42.669]  And it's very sad, and I'm very annoyed.
[00:46:42.669 --> 00:46:44.130]  This is what happens, and now she comes back.
[00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:45.110]  I'm not even bothering you.
[00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:46.391]  I'm just trying to mind my own business.
[00:46:46.391 --> 00:46:47.891]  This is what happens in the University of Texas.
[00:46:47.891 --> 00:46:48.772]  There's a literal Nazi.
[00:46:48.772 --> 00:46:50.173]  I'm just filing a report, man.
[00:46:50.173 --> 00:46:51.353]  Literal Nazis.
[00:46:51.353 --> 00:46:53.334]  Ladies, calm down.
[00:46:53.334 --> 00:46:54.074]  This is a fascist.
[00:46:54.074 --> 00:46:55.015]  Who's a fascist?
[00:46:55.015 --> 00:46:56.535]  She won't even show her face.
[00:46:56.535 --> 00:46:58.056]  Who's a fascist?
[00:46:58.056 --> 00:46:59.497]  Why do you keep talking about this guy?
[00:46:59.497 --> 00:47:02.158]  Why don't you talk about the statue that you're protesting?
[00:47:02.578 --> 00:47:03.699]  You're a white man.
[00:47:03.699 --> 00:47:04.139]  I'm a white man.
[00:47:22.563 --> 00:47:24.486]  Tell me what white privilege is right now.
[00:47:24.486 --> 00:47:25.868]  Sounds kind of racist.
[00:47:25.868 --> 00:47:26.609]  Tell me what it is.
[00:47:26.609 --> 00:47:28.011]  Racist against what?
[00:47:28.011 --> 00:47:31.216]  When have white people ever suffered?
[00:47:31.216 --> 00:47:32.899]  You literally didn't understand.
[00:47:32.899 --> 00:47:35.483]  You know what happened to Irish people that came here?
[00:47:37.346 --> 00:47:38.727]  Yeah, well what about white people?
[00:47:38.727 --> 00:47:40.468]  Irish people integrated into white people.
[00:47:40.468 --> 00:47:43.390]  You know what's going on to white people in South Africa right now?
[00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:44.951]  Dude, f*** you, this is America.
[00:47:44.951 --> 00:47:46.792]  Let's f***ing talk about what's happening right now.
[00:47:46.792 --> 00:47:48.153]  Okay, what's happening right now?
[00:47:48.153 --> 00:47:49.714]  Have a discourse, have a discourse.
[00:47:49.714 --> 00:47:54.857]  You had, you had, you had, you had two white... Okay, so let's skip ahead here in a moment to the death of America parts.
[00:47:54.857 --> 00:47:56.118]  I mean, there's like 30 minutes of this.
[00:47:56.118 --> 00:47:56.999]  There's several videos.
[00:47:57.819 --> 00:48:05.226]  And notice it's mainly weirdo white people saying, you're an effing white male, get out of here, versus signaling for some black people that are there.
[00:48:05.226 --> 00:48:05.767]  As usual.
[00:48:05.767 --> 00:48:17.418]  So they're showing just how anti-white they are, and how they hate America and all the rest of it, and then they start screaming, death to America, we hate America, it's a horrible nation, when I bet none of these people ever worked a day in their lives.
[00:48:17.998 --> 00:48:33.775]  It's all welfare, it's all tuitions paid for, it's all scholarships, and it's all the big, rich, corrupt university giving worthless degrees by design versus signaling, giving them power so they continue down this rat hole that's meant, in the WikiLeaks, to destroy them.
[00:48:33.775 --> 00:48:34.896]  They'll be unemployable.
[00:48:36.391 --> 00:48:44.957]  Outside of the weirdo system, so the system's making more handicapped people to basically be part of its cult.
[00:48:44.957 --> 00:48:49.279]  I mean, this is so psychopathic, so cold-blooded, and the elites laugh at these people.
[00:48:49.279 --> 00:48:52.241]  Let's go ahead and go to the Death to America part.
[00:48:52.241 --> 00:48:53.262]  Everyone here is American.
[00:48:53.262 --> 00:48:54.263]  Y'all are my men.
[00:48:54.263 --> 00:48:55.563]  We should all be able to get along.
[00:48:55.563 --> 00:48:56.204]  I'm not.
[00:48:56.204 --> 00:48:57.385]  Okay, you're not my man.
[00:48:57.385 --> 00:48:58.085]  Do you hate America?
[00:48:58.085 --> 00:48:59.366]  Kinda, yeah.
[00:48:59.366 --> 00:49:00.206]  You hate America?
[00:49:00.206 --> 00:49:01.447]  Death to America.
[00:49:01.447 --> 00:49:02.348]  Say that again.
[00:49:02.348 --> 00:49:03.128]  This is so powerful.
[00:49:03.128 --> 00:49:04.169]  Back this up ten seconds.
[00:49:04.169 --> 00:49:05.450]  You're there saying, you're my man.
[00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:07.892]  Like Trump said, let's love each other.
[00:49:07.892 --> 00:49:09.374]  Let's come together.
[00:49:09.374 --> 00:49:11.898]  You know, America's got problems, but we've been one of the best nations ever.
[00:49:11.898 --> 00:49:13.240]  You know, let's love each other.
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:14.181]  I feel the love in this room.
[00:49:14.181 --> 00:49:17.006]  Let's come together right now.
[00:49:17.006 --> 00:49:17.807]  I'm not American.
[00:49:17.807 --> 00:49:19.730]  I don't like America.
[00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:21.793]  You know how to show what they really believe in.
[00:49:22.773 --> 00:49:26.216]  They're just bitter, spoiled, rotten nobodies.
[00:49:26.216 --> 00:49:27.618]  Let's go back to it.
[00:49:27.618 --> 00:49:28.639]  Everyone here is American.
[00:49:28.639 --> 00:49:29.640]  Y'all are my men.
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:31.161]  We should all be able to get along.
[00:49:31.161 --> 00:49:31.562]  I'm not.
[00:49:31.562 --> 00:49:32.763]  Okay, you're not my man.
[00:49:32.763 --> 00:49:34.224]  Do you hate America?
[00:49:34.224 --> 00:49:34.745]  Yeah.
[00:49:34.745 --> 00:49:35.586]  You hate America?
[00:49:35.586 --> 00:49:36.867]  Death to America.
[00:49:36.867 --> 00:49:37.688]  Say that again.
[00:49:37.688 --> 00:49:39.049]  Death to America.
[00:49:39.049 --> 00:49:39.269]  Wow.
[00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:41.691]  Wow.
[00:49:41.691 --> 00:49:44.373]  Death to the greatest country in the history of the world.
[00:49:44.373 --> 00:49:46.774]  It's not the greatest country in the history of the world.
[00:49:46.774 --> 00:49:47.135]  Really?
[00:49:47.135 --> 00:49:51.017]  Tell me a country that's had a higher standard of living than the American way of life.
[00:49:51.017 --> 00:49:52.198]  Switzerland, Finland.
[00:49:52.198 --> 00:49:53.138]  Switzerland.
[00:49:53.138 --> 00:49:54.899]  Switzerland won't let anybody in.
[00:49:54.899 --> 00:49:55.640]  And I tell them that.
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:57.001]  Hold on, hold on.
[00:49:57.001 --> 00:49:57.761]  I'm sorry.
[00:49:57.761 --> 00:49:58.622]  Why are they so wealthy?
[00:49:59.793 --> 00:50:01.133]  I don't know.
[00:50:01.133 --> 00:50:01.733]  You don't know.
[00:50:01.733 --> 00:50:03.574]  You seem to know a lot, but you seem not to know anything.
[00:50:03.574 --> 00:50:10.895]  They don't let people like you, social justice warriors, in.
[00:50:10.895 --> 00:50:13.716]  You gotta have a job, you gotta have money.
[00:50:13.716 --> 00:50:18.137]  You know it's like impossible to become a citizen of Switzerland?
[00:50:18.137 --> 00:50:19.717]  It's one of the most conservative nation states.
[00:50:19.717 --> 00:50:21.218]  It's pretty damn hard to become a citizen here, too.
[00:50:21.218 --> 00:50:22.138]  They hoard guns.
[00:50:22.138 --> 00:50:22.558]  Oh, really?
[00:50:22.558 --> 00:50:24.358]  You can walk right across the border, actually.
[00:50:24.358 --> 00:50:26.019]  Now the new president's changing.
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:33.384]  And the most amazing thing about this, Alex, they don't even know who the statue is that's being removed.
[00:50:33.384 --> 00:50:34.404]  I asked them multiple times.
[00:50:34.404 --> 00:50:35.505]  None of them even know.
[00:50:35.505 --> 00:50:37.387]  Your headline's powerful, but it's not.
[00:50:37.387 --> 00:50:40.769]  This is the most epic fail of chanting death to America.
[00:50:40.769 --> 00:50:42.791]  By the way, they hate Trump saying alt-left.
[00:50:43.391 --> 00:50:45.673]  We gotta all start using the term alt-left because they hate that.
[00:50:45.673 --> 00:50:46.193]  They do hate it.
[00:50:46.193 --> 00:50:47.153]  It really drives them crazy.
[00:50:47.153 --> 00:50:50.275]  I want to ask you when we come back, why do they hate it so much?
[00:50:50.275 --> 00:50:51.716]  It's all just as epic.
[00:50:51.716 --> 00:50:58.921]  I mean, you want to see the scum of the earth, a bunch of dirty leg white guys with weird creepy women leading a bunch of idiots.
[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:03.783]  If food became scarce, would you be able to feed yourself and your family?
[00:51:03.783 --> 00:51:12.709]  Have you found some emergency food supplies can cost upwards of $300 for a month's supply, and worst of all, they're packed with chemicals and other unpronounceable ingredients?

[00:54:19.674 --> 00:54:25.042]  David Knight did a great inaugural kickoff of the new transmission, 8 a.m.
[00:54:25.042 --> 00:54:26.143]  to 11 a.m.
[00:54:26.143 --> 00:54:27.325]  Central.

[00:54:28.647 --> 00:54:31.831]  A lot of stations are now announcing they're going to be picking up that syndicated transmission.
[00:54:31.831 --> 00:54:32.992]  Very, very excited about that.
[00:54:34.402 --> 00:54:37.664]  We have a whole bunch of special guests joining us.
[00:54:37.664 --> 00:54:43.948]  Raheem Kassan is going to be coming on, editor-in-chief of Breitbart London, author.
[00:54:43.948 --> 00:54:50.112]  Talk about no-go zones, how Sharia law is becoming to a neighborhood near you, and now in many liberal areas.
[00:54:50.112 --> 00:54:53.434]  If you're a conservative, I've talked to people in Seattle, they said, we're leaving.
[00:54:53.434 --> 00:54:55.035]  We've been born here, but we're Christians.
[00:54:55.675 --> 00:55:00.076]  And our neighbors persecute us, call the police on us, hate us because they know we're Christians.
[00:55:00.076 --> 00:55:02.757]  And they're not even the type of Christians that have it on their bumpers or anything.
[00:55:02.757 --> 00:55:05.738]  They just have talked to them, they know they're Christians, so they hate them.
[00:55:05.738 --> 00:55:07.519]  Well, yeah, they're not frothing at the mouth liberals.
[00:55:07.519 --> 00:55:08.899]  Well, I mean, the liberals have decided.
[00:55:08.899 --> 00:55:15.121]  We're just like the governor of New York said two years ago, if you're pro-life, you're pro-gun, get out of the state.
[00:55:15.121 --> 00:55:16.482]  People said, oh, you're joking.
[00:55:16.482 --> 00:55:18.802]  He said, no, get out.
[00:55:18.802 --> 00:55:20.983]  I mean, this is hardcore.
[00:55:20.983 --> 00:55:22.043]  So he's going to be joining us.
[00:55:22.043 --> 00:55:23.824]  That's all coming up just briefly here.
[00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:28.231]  I'm going to have to end the specials tomorrow.
[00:55:28.231 --> 00:55:29.873]  The BuzzFeed special is going to have to end.
[00:55:29.873 --> 00:55:31.274]  We'll have some new specials.
[00:55:31.274 --> 00:55:33.535]  They just won't be as expansive, obviously.
[00:55:33.535 --> 00:55:36.437]  This is the biggest specials that we've ever had.
[00:55:36.437 --> 00:55:37.858]  Brain Force, 55% off.
[00:55:37.858 --> 00:55:40.400]  The Amazing Nootropic, it is selling out.
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:42.582]  It could be a month before more comes in.
[00:55:42.582 --> 00:55:44.984]  We will not get more DNA Force until the middle of
[00:55:46.465 --> 00:55:48.989]  Uh, September at the earliest.
[00:55:48.989 --> 00:55:52.053]  That is still 20% off, despite the fact it is selling out.
[00:55:52.053 --> 00:55:55.097]  Silver Bullet, colloidal silver, 66% off.
[00:55:55.097 --> 00:55:56.038]  That is selling out.
[00:55:56.038 --> 00:55:57.440]  We're gonna have to stop that.

[00:56:00.384 --> 00:56:02.647]  MycoZX has sold out.
[00:56:03.925 --> 00:56:06.386]  So I told them to hold back some, so we never sold out.
[00:56:06.386 --> 00:56:07.547]  But we sold out of that.
[00:56:07.547 --> 00:56:09.068]  We're not just saying this is selling out.
[00:56:09.068 --> 00:56:10.949]  So the great antifungal is sold out.
[00:56:10.949 --> 00:56:13.870]  Survival Shield X2, 55% off.
[00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:16.832]  That's got to end because we are selling out.

[00:57:09.275 --> 00:57:10.817]  But whatever you do, understand we're in a war.
[00:57:10.817 --> 00:57:21.445]  Now we're gonna go to break, come back in five more minutes with Owen Schroeder and play some more clips of this, but we don't feel good seeing how trashy and dumb and crazy the so-called left is.
[00:57:21.445 --> 00:57:22.666]  We feel very sad.
[00:57:23.567 --> 00:57:24.808]  Because let me tell you something.
[00:57:24.808 --> 00:57:36.039]  They are a frothing cult of brown shirts who want violence, who want to come after everybody, and who are totally ill-equipped, totally stupid, totally unarmed, totally mindless.
[00:57:36.039 --> 00:57:38.982]  But they're set pieces by the big corporate elites.
[00:57:40.214 --> 00:57:45.916]  And they're moving forward with the plan as if Hillary still got elected to get rid of free speech, to bully everyone.
[00:57:45.916 --> 00:57:46.776]  Here's the news.
[00:57:46.776 --> 00:57:50.517]  We're not getting bullied and I don't see this working on people, Owen.
[00:57:50.517 --> 00:57:52.838]  Well, the hate that these people have is real, Alex.
[00:57:52.838 --> 00:57:54.899]  I mean, you experienced it in Seattle.
[00:57:55.399 --> 00:58:03.803]  I mean, you hear from Millie on the show, the audience out there, when she talks about the threats that are levied against her and the things that she experiences.
[00:58:03.803 --> 00:58:07.866]  I mean, these are violent, hateful people.
[00:58:07.866 --> 00:58:09.386]  And we're just mainline.
[00:58:09.386 --> 00:58:14.929]  We want lower taxes, bigger middle class, you know, swimming pools, movie stars.
[00:58:14.929 --> 00:58:16.690]  I mean, we just want America.
[00:58:16.690 --> 00:58:17.951]  We don't want North Korea.
[00:58:18.711 --> 00:58:20.912]  And why do you care if I'm out there filing a report?
[00:58:20.912 --> 00:58:21.732]  I'm not bothering you.
[00:58:21.732 --> 00:58:23.652]  You even heard it in the clip we played in the last episode.
[00:58:23.652 --> 00:58:26.093]  Because these are entitled scum.
[00:58:26.093 --> 00:58:27.453]  These people are dangerous.
[00:58:27.453 --> 00:58:32.874]  Hell, Black Lives Matter openly says kill cops and the media, CNN, says it's great.
[00:58:32.874 --> 00:58:38.715]  CNN, we've got more clips of CNN, New York Times, all saying Antifa is good, violence is good.
[00:58:38.715 --> 00:58:41.096]  They're bullying their enemies.
[00:58:41.096 --> 00:58:45.117]  CNN, folks, is literally your enemy.
[00:58:45.117 --> 00:58:45.957]  They say they are.
[00:58:46.559 --> 00:58:48.196]  We're gonna come back with your incredible report, Owen.
[00:58:51.047 --> 00:58:56.451]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:58:56.451 --> 00:58:59.293]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[00:58:59.293 --> 00:59:01.275]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[00:59:01.275 --> 00:59:06.299]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[00:59:06.299 --> 00:59:08.400]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:09.681]  In fact, it's certified.
[00:59:09.681 --> 00:59:14.805]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:59:14.805 --> 00:59:18.168]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants
[00:59:18.268 --> 00:59:18.608]  I don't know.
[00:59:41.452 --> 00:59:43.573]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:43.573 --> 00:59:44.434]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:44.434 --> 00:59:48.796]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:00:20.365 --> 01:00:24.107]  I've got one more clip, Owen Troyer, you want to play.
[01:00:24.107 --> 01:00:26.688]  The full clips are up on Infowars.com.
[01:00:26.688 --> 01:00:30.570]  I just think your headline's not strong enough, but I can't come up with a headline strong enough.
[01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:42.896]  We're a bunch of frothing idiots screaming, we hate America, death to America, we hate white people, when they're mainly white, saying we hate this country, this country sucks.
[01:00:42.896 --> 01:00:44.177]  And meanwhile,
[01:00:46.297 --> 01:00:49.602]  It just gets worse by the minute with the big corporate elites financing this.
[01:00:49.602 --> 01:00:52.846]  So, break down other points and tell us about this final clip.
[01:00:52.846 --> 01:01:00.616]  So, it shows the mindset of these people and it wouldn't be so scary if we didn't see this in all cities across the United States of America.
[01:01:00.616 --> 01:01:01.578]  We saw it in Seattle.
[01:01:01.578 --> 01:01:03.600]  We saw it every time Trump has a rally.
[01:01:04.221 --> 01:01:13.213]  And it's it honestly is it's scary, honestly, to be out there and to know that they know who you are and that they hate you and that they're starting to get violent.
[01:01:13.213 --> 01:01:14.194]  It's it's a real thing.
[01:01:14.194 --> 01:01:17.238]  And I mean, you know, the police can only do so much.
[01:01:17.238 --> 01:01:18.720]  And so this next clip we're about to play.
[01:01:19.790 --> 01:01:21.030]  You have no idea who I am!
[01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:22.471]  You don't know anything about me!
[01:01:22.471 --> 01:01:23.391]  It's really sad, too.
[01:01:48.248 --> 01:01:51.070]  So here's the alt-left that thinks they're gonna make America better.
[01:01:51.070 --> 01:01:53.431]  I'm not the alt-left, I'm the real left!
[01:01:53.431 --> 01:01:54.011]  You're an alt-left?
[01:01:54.011 --> 01:01:55.092]  You're right.
[01:01:55.092 --> 01:01:56.053]  You're right, guys.
[01:01:56.053 --> 01:01:56.493]  You're right.
[01:01:56.493 --> 01:01:58.294]  I'm not no f***ing alt-left!
[01:01:58.294 --> 01:01:59.655]  Alright guys, we've got the new term.
[01:01:59.655 --> 01:02:01.276]  This is the alt-reality.
[01:02:01.276 --> 01:02:03.337]  Because these people don't live in reality.
[01:02:03.337 --> 01:02:06.539]  RippleWars.com is going square.
[01:02:06.539 --> 01:02:07.099]  So there you go.
[01:02:07.099 --> 01:02:09.260]  She says we're the destroy America left.
[01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:10.261]  We're the real left.
[01:02:10.261 --> 01:02:11.582]  Their own words.
[01:02:11.582 --> 01:02:13.503]  And we've seen these people in cities across America.
[01:02:13.503 --> 01:02:15.884]  But here's the craziest thing about it, Alex.
[01:02:15.884 --> 01:02:16.585]  So this morning,
[01:02:17.833 --> 01:02:20.257]  I come on, before I come on, I'm looking at all the news.
[01:02:20.257 --> 01:02:23.142]  I'm looking at who's all covering this and what they're saying.
[01:02:23.142 --> 01:02:24.324]  Everyone's covering it the same.
[01:02:24.324 --> 01:02:26.728]  University of Texas removes Confederate statue from main area.
[01:02:26.728 --> 01:02:28.331]  Robert E. Lee, uh, racist, this.
[01:02:28.331 --> 01:02:29.473]  Here's what the president said, that.
[01:02:29.473 --> 01:02:29.914]  Blah, blah, blah.
[01:02:29.914 --> 01:02:30.054]  Okay.
[01:02:31.135 --> 01:02:34.337]  All of these people that covered it saw my video clip.
[01:02:34.337 --> 01:02:37.098]  All of the people, all the media that was there saw these clips.
[01:02:37.098 --> 01:02:38.739]  They saw what these people said.
[01:02:38.739 --> 01:02:40.840]  They saw what these people looked like.
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.061]  Yet, somehow, that doesn't make the news.
[01:02:43.061 --> 01:02:43.921]  Zero news!
[01:02:43.921 --> 01:02:46.062]  Owen Troyer doesn't make any of these stories.
[01:02:46.062 --> 01:02:50.524]  None of these people in the street saying, death to America, makes one of these stories today.
[01:02:50.524 --> 01:02:51.085]  It should be!
[01:02:51.085 --> 01:02:51.945]  Here's the headline!
[01:02:51.945 --> 01:02:55.286]  Groups chanting, death to America, remove statues.
[01:02:55.286 --> 01:02:57.528]  We're the real left.
[01:02:57.528 --> 01:02:58.848]  We're the destroy America left.
[01:02:58.848 --> 01:03:00.049]  And by the way, you know why they hate that?
[01:03:00.709 --> 01:03:05.212]  They're all about defining words that the media uses and we all follow them.
[01:03:05.212 --> 01:03:07.954]  They are obsessed with attacking words and language.
[01:03:07.954 --> 01:03:13.298]  And the fact that Trump would call them alt-left, they want to define us as alt-right to put us in a corner.
[01:03:13.298 --> 01:03:15.259]  They understand what they're doing.
[01:03:15.259 --> 01:03:20.363]  Can you believe we're being dominated by literal people?
[01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:21.624]  I saw the video, folks.
[01:03:21.624 --> 01:03:23.465]  Those people don't take baths.
[01:03:23.465 --> 01:03:24.706]  They don't wipe their butts.
[01:03:24.706 --> 01:03:27.388]  I mean, these people are into being filth.
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:29.061]  And they hate America.
[01:03:29.061 --> 01:03:30.522]  They said it in their own words.
[01:03:30.522 --> 01:03:32.523]  You think they like seeing success?
[01:03:32.523 --> 01:03:39.648]  You think they like seeing ski boats and happy families and people of all colors coming together and barbecues?
[01:03:39.648 --> 01:03:40.608]  They don't like it.
[01:03:40.608 --> 01:03:45.231]  They're miserable trash that want to conquer things.
[01:03:45.231 --> 01:03:49.494]  I'm just trying to figure out what is the end of these people?
[01:03:49.494 --> 01:03:50.695]  This is the end.
[01:03:50.695 --> 01:03:55.398]  We must remove all financial support from any major corporation that supports globalism.
[01:03:55.398 --> 01:03:57.600]  We must research everywhere we spend money.
[01:03:58.735 --> 01:04:03.621]  We must remove ourselves from them and realize they are the equivalent of Nazi brown shirts.
[01:04:03.621 --> 01:04:05.203]  They call us Nazis all day.
[01:04:05.203 --> 01:04:11.630]  They're a political group of bullies that want to overthrow the system and take full control of the means of production.
[01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:12.811]  I can't even go do a report.
[01:04:12.811 --> 01:04:13.973]  You want to ask who they are?
[01:04:13.973 --> 01:04:14.894]  They're all wearing red out.
[01:04:14.894 --> 01:04:15.975]  They're all communists.
[01:04:15.975 --> 01:04:16.215]  Alex!
[01:04:16.215 --> 01:04:18.518]  But they play this game and go, oh, we're anti-fascists.
[01:04:18.638 --> 01:04:23.165]  This is one of the most trending stories in America right now, how they're removing these Confederate statues.
[01:04:23.165 --> 01:04:24.487]  Everyone's talking about this.
[01:04:24.487 --> 01:04:26.169]  I just go down there to file a report.
[01:04:26.169 --> 01:04:27.691]  Why wouldn't I file a report?
[01:04:27.691 --> 01:04:28.733]  This is a huge story!
[01:04:28.733 --> 01:04:29.434]  I'm covering it!
[01:04:29.434 --> 01:04:34.741]  Let's say, here's a profile of the people there that the university is virtue signaling to.
[01:04:35.602 --> 01:04:36.803]  But I was the only one that covered it.
[01:04:36.803 --> 01:04:42.509]  Everyone else just shows up, toes the party line, and shoots the b-roll, and then prints their happy story here.
[01:04:42.509 --> 01:04:44.971]  And by the way, they're on video telling you to get out of there.
[01:04:44.971 --> 01:04:48.334]  So, this is a no-go zone now in most of these universities.
[01:04:48.334 --> 01:04:49.855]  Four whites, four conservatives.
[01:04:49.855 --> 01:04:53.559]  Just like the girls that were wearing the Make America Great hats getting kicked off campus.
[01:04:53.559 --> 01:04:54.740]  That's on InfoWars.com.
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:59.001]  Why is the fungus?
[01:04:59.001 --> 01:05:00.082]  Why is the mold?
[01:05:00.082 --> 01:05:01.823]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[01:05:01.823 --> 01:05:02.784]  What is going on?
[01:05:02.784 --> 01:05:03.544]  What has changed?
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:29.281]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[01:05:29.281 --> 01:05:31.261]  I want to get your reviews on what you have to say.
[01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:32.722]  For me, it's been incredible.
[01:05:32.722 --> 01:05:37.244]  MycoZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast.
[01:05:37.244 --> 01:05:37.964]  Get it today.
[01:05:37.964 --> 01:05:38.544]  Limited run.
[01:05:38.544 --> 01:05:39.965]  It'll be months till we get more.
[01:05:39.965 --> 01:05:44.627]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:05:44.627 --> 01:05:47.968]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[01:05:47.968 --> 01:05:50.289]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[01:05:50.289 --> 01:05:51.709]  Look at the response we're getting.
[01:05:51.709 --> 01:05:53.650]  We're changing the world together.
[01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:54.651]  You are the Infowar.
[01:05:54.651 --> 01:05:55.391]  God bless you all.
[01:05:57.133 --> 01:06:01.816]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[01:06:01.816 --> 01:06:13.302]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition.
[01:06:13.402 --> 01:06:14.143]  We're good to go.
[01:06:35.083 --> 01:06:37.445]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[01:06:37.445 --> 01:06:38.906]  We're getting results.
[01:06:38.906 --> 01:06:45.032]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[01:06:45.032 --> 01:06:47.914]  Caveman is finally back at the InfoWars store.
[01:06:47.914 --> 01:06:54.480]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free, AAA253-3139.
[01:06:57.406 --> 01:06:59.287]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:06:59.287 --> 01:07:01.328]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:07:01.328 --> 01:07:04.230]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:10.293]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:07:10.293 --> 01:07:19.477]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[01:07:19.477 --> 01:07:24.340]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:27.002]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:07:27.002 --> 01:07:35.030]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:07:35.030 --> 01:07:36.131]  The general public doesn't.
[01:07:37.211 --> 01:07:41.155]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:07:41.155 --> 01:07:44.738]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:07:44.738 --> 01:07:51.444]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:07:51.444 --> 01:07:58.731]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at MFullWorthStore.com.
[01:07:58.731 --> 01:08:01.854]  I've got a tiger in my tail!
[01:08:09.281 --> 01:08:11.524]  He never gives up.
[01:08:11.524 --> 01:08:13.506]  He's Alex Jones.
[01:08:13.506 --> 01:08:16.670]  Broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas.
[01:08:16.670 --> 01:08:17.251]  Worldwide.
[01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:38.038]  We've got Larry Pinckney, an original founding member of the Black Panther Party, who followed the ideas of Martin Luther King, judge a person by the character of their deeds, what they do, not the color of their skin.
[01:08:38.038 --> 01:08:40.659]  He's going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:08:40.659 --> 01:08:49.004]  Raheem Kassam is the editor-in-chief of Breitbart London, one of the most important branches outside the U.S., and author of the new book, No Go Zones.
[01:08:49.878 --> 01:08:53.582]  How surreal law is coming to a neighborhood near you.
[01:08:53.582 --> 01:09:02.210]  The eclipse has started on the west coast over Oregon and it will come over Texas in about the next hour and a half.
[01:09:02.210 --> 01:09:04.672]  We will cover that as it unfolds.
[01:09:04.672 --> 01:09:08.116]  We have links to the NASA channel on InfoWars.com.
[01:09:08.116 --> 01:09:09.617]  We now have Pope Francis.
[01:09:10.754 --> 01:09:16.196]  Saying the rights of immigrants and migrants trumps those of national security, while he lives behind big walls.
[01:09:16.196 --> 01:09:25.940]  This is a globalist project of the elite to flood the West, to bankrupt the cultures, and to bring in non-compatible orthodox Islam.
[01:09:27.659 --> 01:09:34.563]  To then force Western countries to get rid of their liberal, true liberal policies.
[01:09:34.563 --> 01:09:36.244]  You think, well wait a minute, what do you mean liberals?
[01:09:36.244 --> 01:09:37.125]  What do you mean liberal policies?
[01:09:37.125 --> 01:09:38.706]  We mean classical liberal.
[01:09:38.706 --> 01:09:39.886]  The Renaissance.
[01:09:39.886 --> 01:09:42.808]  Bringing in incompatible groups to live in free societies.
[01:09:42.808 --> 01:09:46.090]  That's the admitted plan by Peter Sutherland, the UN, the Pope.
[01:09:46.090 --> 01:09:47.651]  This is all public.
[01:09:47.651 --> 01:09:52.314]  The Pope said earlier this year, he gets nauseous when he hears about Europe's Christian roots.
[01:09:52.314 --> 01:09:53.695]  So the left is allied
[01:09:54.813 --> 01:09:56.174]  With radical Islam.
[01:09:56.174 --> 01:10:04.340]  And I used to always hear this 10, 15, 20 years ago from David Horowitz and stuff, and I thought that the left, it'll never support folks that throw gays off buildings.
[01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:07.282]  And all the rest is, and you know what, they don't just support it, they're running it.
[01:10:07.282 --> 01:10:11.325]  The boats coming in from North Africa are paid for by Soros.
[01:10:11.325 --> 01:10:15.528]  The EU Navy says they're going to block Italy and having its Navy ship people back.
[01:10:15.528 --> 01:10:17.690]  I mean, the EU's now coming in.
[01:10:17.690 --> 01:10:20.072]  So Raheem Kassam is our guest, Breitbart.
[01:10:22.144 --> 01:10:48.985]  He can speak to all this, but I was just in Seattle, had people try to run me over with cars, scream and cuss at me, even when I was with my baby, my three-month-old daughter, and then run when they say you're a Nazi, then they run off, throw coughing on me, you name it, and it was mainly white folks doing it, virtue signaling, and it really, really concerned me for them because it's a no-go zone attitude.
[01:10:49.798 --> 01:11:00.085]  We sent reporters to Brussels, Belgium, to Paris, France, to many other areas, and I've been in London just videotaping a famous building.
[01:11:00.085 --> 01:11:05.228]  And folks in classical Muslim garb will come over and say, turn your camera off, you're not videotaping me.
[01:11:05.228 --> 01:11:08.310]  So it's this whole no-go zone thing is really getting intensive.
[01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:12.933]  And my reporter was there when they were taking down Confederate statues last night at UT because he was white.
[01:11:12.933 --> 01:11:15.595]  Whites were saying, you're an effing white male, get out of here.
[01:11:16.385 --> 01:11:18.729]  And quote Channing, death to America.
[01:11:18.729 --> 01:11:29.724]  So it seems like, well doesn't seem like, the left has taken on, because they're such an empty group, the spirit of radical Islam, because at least it actually has something in it.
[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:37.343]  You can say you don't like it, but I think there's been a Vulcan mind meld of the left and orthodox Wahhabist Islam.
[01:11:37.343 --> 01:11:44.046]  We'll talk to Rahim Kassan, Breitbart.com, the London editor-in-chief, to give us his expert breakdown on this.
[01:11:44.046 --> 01:11:48.148]  And also, I know he's got intel on the exit of Stephen Bannon and more.
[01:11:48.148 --> 01:11:48.929]  So thank you for joining us.
[01:11:50.231 --> 01:11:51.151]  Thank you for having me.
[01:11:51.151 --> 01:11:58.715]  And by the way, I saw that extraordinary footage of you being attacked with that hot coffee or whatever it was.
[01:11:58.715 --> 01:12:05.998]  And I just want to say, on behalf of all slightly pudgy, brunette, bespeckled men, I'm sorry.
[01:12:05.998 --> 01:12:08.740]  Well, it's just crazy.
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:11.381]  At least it wasn't the acid attacks we're seeing daily in London now.
[01:12:12.043 --> 01:12:12.683]  Right.
[01:12:12.683 --> 01:12:13.584]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:12:13.584 --> 01:12:19.846]  This is of epidemic proportions in London being really used by gangs of younger men.
[01:12:19.846 --> 01:12:22.207]  And they're using it indiscriminately, by the way.
[01:12:22.207 --> 01:12:25.288]  They're using it against whites, blacks, Muslims.
[01:12:25.288 --> 01:12:28.810]  This is a real criminal epidemic that we're seeing in London.
[01:12:28.810 --> 01:12:29.770]  And it's happening
[01:12:29.770 --> 01:12:39.495]  Being in the areas in which you have all this sort of diversity and multiculturalism, where these things are the most rife, I was in Tower Hamlets just recently.
[01:12:39.495 --> 01:12:46.058]  I took a New York Times Magazine writer with me and I toured him around the neighborhood.
[01:12:46.058 --> 01:12:48.960]  And we had people coming up to us telling us we weren't welcome there.
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:53.762]  There was graffiti that we saw that said Taliban are here on the storefronts in Tower Hamlets.
[01:12:53.762 --> 01:12:56.484]  And I said to this guy who, again, New York Times, I said to him,
[01:12:56.864 --> 01:13:00.645]  Do you think we oversell this in terms of what Breitbart London reports on?
[01:13:00.645 --> 01:13:04.687]  And he turned to me, he went, actually, I think you undersell it.
[01:13:04.687 --> 01:13:06.247]  Wow.
[01:13:06.247 --> 01:13:10.909]  So break down your expert analysis of the left and radical Islam merging.
[01:13:11.969 --> 01:13:13.729]  Well, we've talked about this now for some years.
[01:13:13.729 --> 01:13:21.671]  We in Europe call it the Red-Green Alliance, because red is the color of socialism and communism, the Labour Party.
[01:13:21.671 --> 01:13:26.232]  In Europe, I understand red over here in the United States is affiliated with the Republican Party.
[01:13:26.232 --> 01:13:28.912]  But we call it the Red-Green Alliance, and green is the color of Islam.
[01:13:28.912 --> 01:13:37.014]  This is where the radical left, or even the centre-left, quite frankly, the political establishment, has allied with Islam in order to
[01:13:38.094 --> 01:13:42.697]  In Andrew Nether's words, Andrew Nether was an advisor to former Prime Minister Tony Blair.
[01:13:42.697 --> 01:13:46.900]  In Andrew Nether's own words, rub the right nose in diversity.
[01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:53.164]  You see it from the politicians, the childless politicians by the way, all across Europe, the leaders of the nations.
[01:13:53.864 --> 01:14:01.809]  And you see it all across, you know, even pervading the Catholic Church right now, as you mentioned, with the Pope coming out and saying the rights of migrants.
[01:14:01.809 --> 01:14:07.011]  Trump, basically, Europe's cultural, you know, it's cultural identity.
[01:14:07.011 --> 01:14:09.953]  And you're seeing the Red-Green Alliance here in the United States too.
[01:14:10.433 --> 01:14:27.063]  When the Muslim cleric comes out and says that he wants to annihilate all Jews, and the left runs to his defense and says, oh well he clearly didn't mean what you thought he meant, he's issued a heartfelt apology, we must all bow down to this person and say thank you for being on our shores.
[01:14:27.063 --> 01:14:30.706]  I've seen it all across the United States when I did the research for this book.
[01:14:30.706 --> 01:14:39.271]  I saw the welfarist policies, the ghettoization policies, all the way from Brussels in Sweden, all the way to Hamtramck in Michigan.
[01:14:39.771 --> 01:14:45.093]  They want to keep these people poor, they want to keep them in voting blocks, because it benefits the left.
[01:14:45.093 --> 01:14:53.175]  It benefits the left at the ballot box, and it benefits their fetish for multiculturalism.
[01:14:53.175 --> 01:15:05.039]  I also wonder about the monopolies and the government teaming up, because every airport I go to in the United States, all of the car rental places are run by Somalis, all of the tax, I mean basically all,
[01:15:06.112 --> 01:15:11.538]  And it's nothing but women in hijabs at the airport when I was in Seattle last night.
[01:15:11.538 --> 01:15:16.484]  I mean, almost every woman I saw, 90% were women in hijabs.
[01:15:16.484 --> 01:15:20.288]  I mean, ticket counters, checkpoints, car rental, everywhere.
[01:15:20.288 --> 01:15:23.872]  It's like certain industries are being given to these groups.
[01:15:25.245 --> 01:15:25.885]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:15:25.885 --> 01:15:42.154]  And even I often feel strange going back through security, the border control in the United Kingdom, and having to hand my passport over to a woman in a hijab or a niqab, you know, as if they're going to be concerned with guarding the British border.
[01:15:42.154 --> 01:15:48.537]  You have nothing in common with the United Kingdom and our culture if you think that covering your head and covering your face
[01:15:49.337 --> 01:16:18.797]  Is is their rigor is is normal or acceptable and of course like you say the red-green alliance is very strong on this point Don't forget in 1979 100,000 Iranian women marched in Tehran to demand that they did not have to wear the hijab as per the government the Islamist government diktat We never talk about those women anymore We never talk about the women in Syria who burned in January this year Burned their burqas when their when their town was liberated from Isis instead we're told that the Linda Simon
[01:16:18.797 --> 01:16:19.097]  I don't know.
[01:16:39.679 --> 01:16:40.720]  It really is crazy.
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:42.942]  You know, you're the expert on this.
[01:16:42.942 --> 01:16:44.303]  When is it going to peak?
[01:16:44.303 --> 01:16:54.371]  Because I was reading The Economist magazine, the current issue, the one that has roadkill on the front, talking about the end of the combustion engine, and they said, we're engaged in demographic warfare.
[01:16:54.371 --> 01:16:57.994]  We are bringing in these minority groups to turn them into socialists.
[01:16:57.994 --> 01:17:03.179]  We miscalculated and it's backfired in some areas of Europe and the US, but demographically we're still going to win.
[01:17:03.519 --> 01:17:05.421]  They're admitting a race-based deal.
[01:17:05.421 --> 01:17:07.582]  I wouldn't care what color people were.
[01:17:07.582 --> 01:17:09.564]  They were free market and we lived in peace.
[01:17:09.564 --> 01:17:23.756]  But you see them openly being energized into political warfare systems and it is just crazy to see it inverted now from the KKK to now a minority KKK deal and it's being deployed by major governments.
[01:17:26.172 --> 01:17:39.007]  You know, Alex, I'm often told, in the most racist of terms, by the political left, that because of my skin colour, or because of my name, that I have to have, you know, welfarist, left-wing, pro-sharia politics.
[01:17:39.007 --> 01:17:41.169]  This is the real racism going on today.
[01:17:41.169 --> 01:17:43.492]  They say things to me like, oh, why would you work at Breitbart?
[01:17:43.752 --> 01:17:45.533]  Why would you go on Alex Jones Show?
[01:17:45.533 --> 01:17:50.135]  If you knew what these guys really thought of you, they would deport you in a heartbeat.
[01:17:50.135 --> 01:17:53.776]  Well, actually, I've scarcely ever experienced that on the political right.
[01:17:53.776 --> 01:17:56.637]  And like you said, nobody cares about skin color.
[01:17:56.637 --> 01:18:03.040]  What they care about is if you adopt the values and you want to further the, like you said, Western, you know, classical liberal values.
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:23.628]  Yeah, and that's exactly what I did, and that's exactly why I wrote this book, because there are vast swathes of Europe, and indeed here in the United States now, that are turning into enclaves for migrants who are, let's face it, being used as political pawns by the left, but at the same time establishing their Quranic law, their Islamic rules,
[01:18:24.008 --> 01:18:30.613]  Listen, if I go to the shopping mall now on the cover of Gap and then the other store, it's women and hijabs everywhere.
[01:18:30.613 --> 01:18:42.061]  They admittedly are force-feeding it for the total, I guess, forced integration and Islamification of the West with us having to basically convert as demis or whatever to a submission to it.
[01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:52.779]  Yes, well, you look at Canada passing, in effect, a blasphemy law against criticizing Islam, M103, that passed in Canada a few months ago.
[01:18:52.779 --> 01:18:56.202]  We're getting to a point, and the point has already been reached, frankly.
[01:18:56.202 --> 01:18:58.524]  The subtitle of the book is a little bit disingenuous.
[01:18:58.524 --> 01:19:01.227]  It shouldn't be how Sharia law is coming to a neighborhood near you.
[01:19:01.227 --> 01:19:03.509]  It should be how Sharia law is already in a neighborhood near you.
[01:19:04.858 --> 01:19:06.899]  Well, everybody talks about Nazis all day.
[01:19:06.899 --> 01:19:14.243]  The only cultures I see that are behaving like Nazis are some of these orthodox Islamic countries, who I'd love to see reformed.
[01:19:14.243 --> 01:19:29.410]  And, I mean, imagine if we were bringing people in from some other place with another religion or group, where you cut women's genitals off, you make them wear hoods over their heads, they can't drive cars, you execute gay people, and then you bring this up to the left and they just scream and yell and say, shut up Nazi!
[01:19:29.410 --> 01:19:29.790]  I mean, it's...
[01:19:30.911 --> 01:19:37.033]  Is it mental illness, or does even the low-level leftist understand their unholy alliance?
[01:19:37.033 --> 01:19:38.013]  They understand it fully.
[01:19:38.013 --> 01:19:40.974]  They will stop at nothing to erase Western civilization.
[01:19:40.974 --> 01:19:42.214]  They will destroy your monuments.
[01:19:42.214 --> 01:19:43.995]  They will destroy your Mount Rushmore.
[01:19:43.995 --> 01:19:47.296]  They have no interest in the preservation of Western culture.
[01:19:47.296 --> 01:19:51.837]  Again, Taliban loves blowing up Roman stuff, loves blowing up Buddhist stuff.
[01:19:51.837 --> 01:19:52.738]  You're absolutely right.
[01:19:52.738 --> 01:19:53.838]  And now the left's the same way.
[01:19:53.838 --> 01:19:55.859]  They want to blow up everything.
[01:19:55.859 --> 01:19:56.559]  Absolutely.
[01:19:56.559 --> 01:19:58.419]  Western culture, they hate it.
[01:19:58.419 --> 01:19:59.000]  They want it gone.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:19:59.640]  They want it dead.
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:00.280]  They want us dead.
[01:20:01.479 --> 01:20:03.701]  Well, you know, the CIA got declassified once.
[01:20:03.701 --> 01:20:06.765]  Ugly buildings, ugly art, ugly culture.
[01:20:06.765 --> 01:20:09.788]  What is going on here?
[01:20:09.788 --> 01:20:16.755]  Well, now, see, I was in Charlottesville, and of course, you know, we have to preface everything every time we talk about this.
[01:20:16.755 --> 01:20:20.680]  Like, moronically, we have to preface it with, and we condemn the neo-Nazis.
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:23.102]  I mean, it should be blatantly obvious that we do that anyway.
[01:20:23.102 --> 01:20:23.603]  Absolutely.
[01:20:24.435 --> 01:20:33.221]  Yeah, exactly, but they force us to do it because the left owns the language and they control the narrative, or at least they try to, but people like you actually get the real truth out there.
[01:20:33.221 --> 01:20:40.606]  What's going on out there is, look, I mean, the Mount Rushmore sculpting was done by Goodson Ball
[01:20:40.606 --> 01:20:41.287]  Well, if you expand on that...
[01:20:59.827 --> 01:21:01.390]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:14.970]  It's mindless, is what it is.
[01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:16.771]  I mean, it's cultish.
[01:21:16.771 --> 01:21:19.692]  And you see this on the left as you see it in Islamic circles.
[01:21:19.692 --> 01:21:28.333]  I mean, the reason that Saeed Farooq and Tashfeen Malik were radicalized in San Bernardino was because they effectively went to a cultish mosque, this Tablighi Jamaat-run mosque.
[01:21:28.333 --> 01:21:31.954]  And people should be aware of this group that's operating in the United States.
[01:21:31.954 --> 01:21:33.415]  The left has the same thing.
[01:21:33.415 --> 01:21:39.616]  They send their people to the... I mean, frankly, they're sending them to the schools and the universities in this country now that are turning them into cults.
[01:21:43.097 --> 01:21:43.998]  Offended by knowledge.
[01:22:01.616 --> 01:22:02.998]  But here's the thing.
[01:22:02.998 --> 01:22:05.620]  These people deserve a padded cell.
[01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:09.785]  And instead of putting these people in a padded cell, you're putting America in a straitjacket.
[01:22:09.785 --> 01:22:13.148]  You're putting the entire country in a straitjacket.
[01:22:13.148 --> 01:22:19.055]  All of these things, these monuments that were even last night torn down in Austin, right?
[01:22:19.055 --> 01:22:21.898]  I mean, this is your culture being taken away from you.
[01:22:21.898 --> 01:22:22.118]  It's your
[01:22:22.278 --> 01:22:23.139]  Well, I want to be clear.
[01:22:51.889 --> 01:23:08.156]  Well that's why the big corporate groups, the big universities, the Bill Gates's, the Jeff Bezos's of the world fund all this is because it diverts everybody from their tax incentives and their free tax deals and the free shipping that Amazon gets that taxpayers pay $1.48 on every package for.
[01:23:08.156 --> 01:23:16.079]  I mean it's classic class warfare to just turn everybody against each other like the old Roman Empire did so they can rule everybody from the castle on the hill.
[01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:25.384]  Because they know if the actual anti-establishment on the right and on the left comes together, then the political establishment is over.
[01:23:25.384 --> 01:23:27.085]  So they're pitting them against one another now.
[01:23:27.085 --> 01:23:30.406]  The rolling coverage of this stuff is no coincidence, it's no accident.
[01:23:30.406 --> 01:23:32.928]  And as you said, sir, that's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:23:32.928 --> 01:23:35.169]  They say, we're desperate, they're waking up, what do we do?
[01:23:35.169 --> 01:23:36.870]  And they go, culture warfare.
[01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:37.530]  Well, what's that mean?
[01:23:39.537 --> 01:23:40.317]  That's exactly right.
[01:23:40.317 --> 01:23:45.962]  I mean, setting these two groups against one another, pretending like they don't have more in common than they have apart.
[01:23:45.962 --> 01:23:49.165]  And I'm not talking about neo-Nazis and radical leftists here.
[01:23:49.165 --> 01:23:59.094]  I'm talking about the political left and the political right, who actually all, you know, they disagree with more wars in Afghanistan, which we're going to hear more about tonight from the President.
[01:23:59.094 --> 01:24:00.455]  This new White House that we've got.
[01:24:00.455 --> 01:24:01.496]  We want lower taxes.
[01:24:01.496 --> 01:24:02.557]  We want security.
[01:24:02.557 --> 01:24:03.578]  We want prosperity.
[01:24:03.578 --> 01:24:03.838]  Absolutely.
[01:24:05.231 --> 01:24:06.131]  Absolutely.
[01:24:06.131 --> 01:24:11.973]  And I'm terrified of what you're going to hear tonight from this West Wing Democrat White House now.
[01:24:11.973 --> 01:24:16.214]  Let's go there because Bannon really has done a great job overall.
[01:24:16.214 --> 01:24:20.255]  The word is he got a foul because of some of the infighting and some of the wars that went on.
[01:24:20.255 --> 01:24:21.756]  But regardless, Breitbart's really
[01:24:22.256 --> 01:24:28.900]  Been helping put out the talking points of truth for the American reboot and those great speeches and everything else.
[01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:34.383]  You know, they can say his great crime was maybe helping the generals and people get in and now they ate him last.
[01:24:34.383 --> 01:24:43.849]  But clearly, I'm really concerned because we saw Mattis saying, well, the president's going to have to wrestle this weekend with what he's going to say Monday, how he's going to explain it to people.
[01:24:43.849 --> 01:24:47.851]  So sounds like he's going to have to explain he's changed his mind for an escalation.
[01:24:47.851 --> 01:24:48.392]  What are you thinking?
[01:24:49.418 --> 01:24:50.218]  I think that's right.
[01:24:50.218 --> 01:24:51.839]  I think you are going to see a ramping up.
[01:24:51.839 --> 01:24:56.760]  And the phrase that is going to be used is conditional.
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:58.760]  It's the word conditional that they say.
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:01.121]  They're not talking about victory in Afghanistan now.
[01:25:01.121 --> 01:25:03.641]  They're talking about conditional circumstances.
[01:25:03.641 --> 01:25:06.362]  This is the president that told us we were going to get tired of winning.
[01:25:06.362 --> 01:25:07.902]  They're now just talking about not losing.
[01:25:07.902 --> 01:25:10.363]  And this sounds like terms of surrender.
[01:25:10.363 --> 01:25:10.703]  Yep.
[01:25:10.703 --> 01:25:13.324]  And you're talking about 4,000 troops are going to be announced now.
[01:25:13.324 --> 01:25:14.764]  And there's going to be another 10,000 in six months.
[01:25:14.764 --> 01:25:18.065]  Sounds just like the Vietnam where you're pulling out, but you're ramping up.
[01:25:18.843 --> 01:25:31.793]  You've got Vietnam going on with Afghanistan, you've got the Bay of Pigs going on in Venezuela, you've got a crisis at home with almost civil warfare out on the streets, and then they wonder why this president is so under the cosh at the moment.
[01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:35.156]  This is probably the most challenged president in decades in this country.
[01:25:35.156 --> 01:25:37.578]  There are so many issues going on around the world.
[01:25:37.578 --> 01:25:39.479]  You've got North Korea as well.
[01:25:39.479 --> 01:25:41.901]  He's totally surrounded.
[01:25:41.901 --> 01:25:42.902]  He's totally surrounded.
[01:25:43.547 --> 01:25:44.307]  It's insane.
[01:25:44.307 --> 01:25:49.349]  Well, let's talk about Afghanistan because Alexander the Great won everywhere he went except there.
[01:25:49.349 --> 01:25:52.430]  No one ever gets out of there because they're all killing each other.
[01:25:52.430 --> 01:25:57.852]  It's the culture and it's totally tribal and so you can't take over a group that won't give up its tribalism.
[01:25:57.852 --> 01:26:01.133]  It's why globalists want to get rid of our culture and then replace it with globalism.
[01:26:01.133 --> 01:26:03.133]  But here they can't get rid of it.
[01:26:03.133 --> 01:26:07.655]  I don't see how escalating the war is going to do anything but make defense contractors more money.
[01:26:08.897 --> 01:26:10.698]  Well, remember what the Taliban said.
[01:26:10.698 --> 01:26:14.079]  America has all the watches, but we have all the time.
[01:26:14.079 --> 01:26:15.420]  They don't play the short game.
[01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:20.002]  They're not playing four-year, eight-year political cycle games with wars around the world.
[01:26:20.002 --> 01:26:28.425]  They're playing long-term strategy to have Islam, and particularly their virulent sect of Deobandi, Hanafist school of Islam, dominate the world.
[01:26:28.425 --> 01:26:30.046]  That's the game they're playing.
[01:26:30.046 --> 01:26:31.587]  They don't need four years to do it.
[01:26:31.587 --> 01:26:32.907]  They don't need eight years to do it.
[01:26:32.907 --> 01:26:34.088]  They're playing the 500-year-long game.
[01:26:34.088 --> 01:26:35.088]  So why are we staying there?
[01:26:35.088 --> 01:26:36.209]  Are we staying there for the opium?
[01:26:37.805 --> 01:26:41.689]  Well, I don't know about the opium, but I think we're staying there to help our defense contractors.
[01:26:41.689 --> 01:26:42.690]  The people who are H.R.
[01:26:42.690 --> 01:26:46.455]  McMaster's friends are going to get very rich off this war.
[01:26:46.455 --> 01:26:50.759]  And, I mean, we should just be blocking people from, you know, who aren't vetted from coming from there.
[01:26:50.759 --> 01:26:53.102]  We should just, we should just let it be on the Stone Edge.
[01:26:54.871 --> 01:26:59.133]  I just, I can't understand constitutionally why there's not more uproar about this.
[01:26:59.133 --> 01:27:01.114]  Your Congress should be consulted about this now.
[01:27:01.114 --> 01:27:02.994]  This cannot be an executive action.
[01:27:02.994 --> 01:27:07.976]  This is the longest war and the American people are effectively having had no say in this.
[01:27:07.976 --> 01:27:14.379]  I mean, Donald Trump himself, one of the reasons he was elected, remember, he was talking about how stupid these long wars were.
[01:27:14.379 --> 01:27:17.660]  He's been on the record about this stuff for such a very long time and that's what people liked.
[01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:28.087]  And I want to be clear, I want to be clear, when it comes to pulling out of TPP, carbon taxes, $4 trillion stock market, not being politically correct, helping the veterans, he gets an A+.
[01:27:28.087 --> 01:27:47.820]  But, when he supported that first Obamacare repeal, it was a bad bill, he really got hurt with his constituents, and if he expands the Afghan war, that's how it always starts, with modest increases, it's going to balloon out of control, and again, Trump loves the military, but he shouldn't conflate that with the generals themselves.
[01:27:49.008 --> 01:27:56.413]  This is what happens when you trust the political establishment, when you trust Mitch McConnell to deliver you health care reform, when you trust H.R.
[01:27:56.413 --> 01:27:59.555]  McMaster to deliver you an exit strategy from Afghanistan.
[01:27:59.555 --> 01:28:00.396]  This is what happens.
[01:28:00.396 --> 01:28:06.179]  You wade further into these things and they like to kick the can down the road because everybody gets rich in the meantime.
[01:28:06.179 --> 01:28:06.640]  That's right.
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:08.881]  Bannon didn't want to go along with an expansion of the war.
[01:28:08.881 --> 01:28:12.924]  He said, deliver on your promises, we'll save the country, we'll turn it all around.
[01:28:12.924 --> 01:28:16.326]  If we don't navigate exactly the way we said, we'll be destroyed.
[01:28:16.326 --> 01:28:18.848]  Your intel on why Bannon left?
[01:28:19.689 --> 01:28:24.032]  You know, what Bannon wanted was to prescribe the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization.
[01:28:24.032 --> 01:28:26.273]  He wanted to leave the Paris climate deal.
[01:28:26.273 --> 01:28:30.396]  He wanted to end these stupid trade deals that you have all across North America.
[01:28:30.396 --> 01:28:33.758]  He wanted to revise the things that are killing American jobs.
[01:28:33.758 --> 01:28:38.482]  And of course, no wonder he's under attack from the biggest Chinese newspaper right now, by the way.
[01:28:38.482 --> 01:28:41.484]  Today, published an op-ed saying, what a terrible person this is.
[01:28:41.804 --> 01:28:42.985]  Because he knows the games.
[01:28:42.985 --> 01:28:50.550]  He knows the tables are being run on the United States on an international basis and the Chinese are terrified of somebody like that because he knows the game.
[01:28:50.550 --> 01:29:02.618]  He left because what's the point in litigating these fights day in day out in the West Wing when you can litigate them on a massive website with a massive audience that has significant swing now in the country and he's going to be doing just that.
[01:29:02.618 --> 01:29:11.144]  It's bittersweet because he's a loss for the American people in the White House but he's a massive game for us at Breitbart and you're going to be hearing much more about him.
[01:29:11.144 --> 01:29:11.664]  Watch this special.
[01:29:12.805 --> 01:29:24.614]  Well, he did resign, and that's why Trump last week in his second speech, or was it the third speech, it was the third speech, from Trump Tower said, oh Bannon, he's a good guy, I don't know how long he'll be here.
[01:29:24.614 --> 01:29:26.796]  Because Bannon had already resigned, what, back?
[01:29:26.796 --> 01:29:27.216]  That's right.
[01:29:27.216 --> 01:29:28.077]  The word is, was it on the 4th?
[01:29:29.710 --> 01:29:30.830]  That's right, absolutely.
[01:29:30.830 --> 01:29:35.252]  Well, let's spend a few more minutes on that and then we're going to get Larry Pickney, an original Black Panther, on.
[01:29:35.252 --> 01:29:38.153]  But Raheem Kassan is our guest, Breitbart.com.
[01:29:38.153 --> 01:29:40.294]  No, I mean, Bannon resigned, folks.
[01:29:40.294 --> 01:29:42.935]  He was already resigned whenever Trump talked about it.
[01:29:42.935 --> 01:29:46.056]  We'll be back.
[01:29:46.056 --> 01:29:47.436]  We're on the march.
[01:29:47.436 --> 01:29:49.977]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:49.977 --> 01:29:52.658]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:57.685 --> 01:31:01.687]  A new shipment of Bio-True Selenium is now available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:01.687 --> 01:31:03.167]  We've been sold out for months.
[01:31:03.167 --> 01:31:08.229]  Our one-of-a-kind Infowars Life Bio-True Selenium formula is now back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:12.370]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[01:31:12.370 --> 01:31:22.034]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium, but Bio-True Selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[01:31:22.034 --> 01:31:24.735]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are
[01:31:24.835 --> 01:31:25.956]  We're good to go.
[01:31:51.718 --> 01:31:53.780]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[01:31:53.780 --> 01:31:55.201]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[01:31:55.201 --> 01:31:57.763]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:57.763 --> 01:32:03.228]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:32:03.228 --> 01:32:05.310]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:32:05.310 --> 01:32:10.615]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:32:10.615 --> 01:32:14.138]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[01:32:14.438 --> 01:32:17.900]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:21.081]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:32:21.081 --> 01:32:24.963]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:32:24.963 --> 01:32:32.126]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:32:32.126 --> 01:32:37.528]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[01:32:37.688 --> 01:32:38.529]  We're good to go.
[01:33:07.521 --> 01:33:13.746]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:13.746 --> 01:33:16.007]  Larry Pinckney, and we're getting him queued up right now.
[01:33:16.007 --> 01:33:20.651]  He's one of the founding members of the original Black Panther Party, not to be confused with the new Black Panther Party.
[01:33:20.651 --> 01:33:27.116]  He's going to break down what he thinks of Antifa, the alt-left, and the attempt to start a race war in this country as soon as we get him on the line here in a few minutes.
[01:33:27.116 --> 01:33:34.662]  I wanted to finish up with Raheem Kassan, the amazing editor of Breitbart London over in the UK, one of their most important branches.
[01:33:35.752 --> 01:33:38.735]  And what he's saying is the intel I got from my sources.
[01:33:38.735 --> 01:33:42.218]  Other folks are like, well, Bannon was part of these purges of other folks.
[01:33:42.218 --> 01:33:43.999]  He deserves what happened.
[01:33:43.999 --> 01:33:49.124]  And there's just personalities and infighting that go on that I'm not part of.
[01:33:49.124 --> 01:33:51.686]  It doesn't mean guests we have on and people aren't involved in it.
[01:33:51.686 --> 01:33:52.447]  I'm not involved in it.
[01:33:52.927 --> 01:33:54.908]  I'm not in competition with Sean Hannity.
[01:33:54.908 --> 01:33:57.488]  I'm not in competition with Tucker Carlson and Daily Caller.
[01:33:57.488 --> 01:33:59.949]  I'm not in competition with Matt Drudge and DrudgeReport.com.
[01:33:59.949 --> 01:34:01.369]  I'm not in competition with Breitbart.
[01:34:01.369 --> 01:34:06.890]  These globalists are coming after us, our families, our rights, our private property.
[01:34:06.890 --> 01:34:13.252]  They're declaring they're authoritarian and they are a clear and present massive danger that we're barely beating right now.
[01:34:14.324 --> 01:34:18.169]  So I want to be clear that the biggest thing, our biggest hindrance is infighting.
[01:34:18.169 --> 01:34:23.896]  The left is focused like a hateful laser beam on the West and on open society values.
[01:34:23.896 --> 01:34:30.525]  That's why they call it an open society, the Soros operation, like they call anti-fascists when they are the definition of fascists.
[01:34:31.752 --> 01:34:34.973]  So just finishing up, his phone battery is about to die.
[01:34:34.973 --> 01:34:38.294]  Raheem Kassan, you were getting into Bannon.
[01:34:38.294 --> 01:34:38.854]  Absolutely.
[01:34:38.854 --> 01:34:41.794]  I mean, I know just a lot of the stuff Bannon did.
[01:34:41.794 --> 01:34:44.055]  He was a real treasure at the White House.
[01:34:44.055 --> 01:34:46.135]  He became a distraction in the media.
[01:34:46.135 --> 01:34:52.117]  But long before, a week before the whole thing happened in Charlottesville, he was already, from my intel, had resigned.
[01:34:53.077 --> 01:34:55.359]  And so that's another whole red herring now.
[01:34:55.359 --> 01:35:05.849]  And as you said, the Communist Chinese and others, the Pope, they're all basically attacking him, myself and others, because we're just nationalists promoting common sense and comparing that to globalism.
[01:35:05.849 --> 01:35:09.252]  I mean, it's an easy sell for what we're promoting.
[01:35:09.252 --> 01:35:13.876]  Open, true, free market, Americana, Western civilization.
[01:35:13.876 --> 01:35:16.399]  You stack it up next to what's going on in other areas of the world.
[01:35:16.399 --> 01:35:17.740]  I mean, it's really simple.
[01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:18.861]  Author of No Go Zones.
[01:35:19.863 --> 01:35:23.132]  Finish up your points on the Bannon situation.
[01:35:23.965 --> 01:35:29.927]  Yeah, well, he had offered his resignation two weeks before the Charlottesville thing even occurred.
[01:35:29.927 --> 01:35:33.488]  But of course, like you said, he was demonized in the press.
[01:35:33.488 --> 01:35:35.348]  But why was he demonized in the press?
[01:35:35.348 --> 01:35:37.389]  Not because these people disliked him.
[01:35:37.389 --> 01:35:45.671]  Alex, you know these people would come to the Breitbart parties at CPAC and drink all of our alcohol and eat all of our canapes and smoke all of our cigars.
[01:35:45.671 --> 01:35:46.792]  Apologies for that.
[01:35:46.792 --> 01:35:48.112]  You know that was happening.
[01:35:48.112 --> 01:35:50.573]  So it's not like they thought he was some sort of boogie monster.
[01:35:50.573 --> 01:35:51.373]  They knew he wasn't.
[01:35:51.653 --> 01:35:52.614]  They were setting this up.
[01:35:52.614 --> 01:35:57.639]  They were setting this person up to be a fall guy for the nationalist, for the economic nationalist movement.
[01:35:57.639 --> 01:35:59.341]  And they got what they wanted.
[01:35:59.341 --> 01:36:04.626]  You know, they were portraying him as the Grim Reaper at the same time they were portraying him as President Bannon.
[01:36:04.626 --> 01:36:05.527]  They knew that would...
[01:36:07.261 --> 01:36:07.541]  I think?
[01:36:29.891 --> 01:36:36.112]  And that will make people reassured that just because Bannon's left, it doesn't mean that the Western Democrats are in charge.
[01:36:36.112 --> 01:36:37.132]  But maybe they are.
[01:36:37.132 --> 01:36:37.793]  Who knows?
[01:36:37.793 --> 01:36:38.673]  And let's be clear.
[01:36:38.673 --> 01:36:47.994]  We have a true Nazi collaborator, Soros, who is literally behind almost all of this with other big megacorporations, trying to sow racial division in fighting.
[01:36:47.994 --> 01:36:49.875]  And then they point at us and call us Nazis.
[01:36:49.875 --> 01:36:51.575]  It is crazy.
[01:36:51.575 --> 01:36:53.615]  And it's just so stupid.
[01:36:53.615 --> 01:36:55.036]  And it really makes my blood boil.
[01:36:55.036 --> 01:36:55.916]  But the good news is,
[01:36:56.976 --> 01:37:03.742]  When I was out in Seattle and other areas, it was almost only weirdo white people, virtue signaling, screaming I was a racist.
[01:37:03.742 --> 01:37:07.324]  And most of the folks shaking my hand were black or were, you know, Asian.
[01:37:07.324 --> 01:37:10.026]  And I'm not saying it to virtue signal, it's true!
[01:37:10.026 --> 01:37:18.033]  I found most of the frothing, even last night, down at UT with Owen down there, was mainly white people screaming, F you white male, you know, I hate America.
[01:37:18.033 --> 01:37:19.914]  Well, I hate the bad parts of America.
[01:37:19.914 --> 01:37:21.195]  I love the good parts of America.
[01:37:21.195 --> 01:37:23.157]  And we're all America together now.
[01:37:23.757 --> 01:37:28.061]  And it just seems like a globalist desperate action, all of this infighting.
[01:37:28.061 --> 01:37:33.025]  Do you think the merger of radical orthodox Islam with the West is going to be successful?
[01:37:34.315 --> 01:37:36.836]  Well, it's already in many of your communities.
[01:37:36.836 --> 01:37:40.838]  It's actually, there's a lot of these places popping up all around the United States.
[01:37:40.838 --> 01:37:44.480]  They're trying to shut down dissenters, people who are whistleblowers.
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:50.903]  You know, they call people like me Islamophobes, despite the fact that I was raised in Islam, and I'm now blowing the whistle on all of this, Alex.
[01:37:50.903 --> 01:37:52.564]  So, I think we're there.
[01:37:52.564 --> 01:37:55.986]  We're at a tipping point already, quite literally, if you're looking at me from my phone.
[01:37:56.746 --> 01:38:05.188]  But actually, you know, the serious point here is, it's happening in Detroit, it's happening in wider Michigan, it's happening in Minnesota, it's even happening down there in Texas.
[01:38:05.188 --> 01:38:08.990]  And you've got to know the difference between the good ones and the bad ones.
[01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:10.650]  There are some good ones out there.
[01:38:10.650 --> 01:38:15.711]  Dr. Zudi Jasser out of Phoenix, Raheel Raza in Canada, Majid Nawaz in the United Kingdom.
[01:38:15.711 --> 01:38:17.712]  There are good ones out there trying to reform Islam.
[01:38:17.992 --> 01:38:27.198]  But you have to throw your support behind them because every time these guys speak out, the Southern Poverty Law Center calls them a bunch of Islamophobe haters just because they don't want to follow Sharia law.
[01:38:27.198 --> 01:38:27.899]  It's disgusting.
[01:38:27.899 --> 01:38:28.699]  It's outrageous.
[01:38:28.699 --> 01:38:38.026]  Well, Raheem Kassam, Editor of Breitbart London, I want to get you back on about your life story, which is so interesting, and your great knowledge of history.
[01:38:38.026 --> 01:38:40.287]  So thanks for coming on with us last week and this week.
[01:38:40.287 --> 01:38:41.988]  Look forward to speaking to you very, very soon.
[01:38:41.988 --> 01:38:43.429]  The book is No Go Zones.
[01:38:43.429 --> 01:38:44.610]  Thank you, sir.
[01:38:44.610 --> 01:38:44.991]  Thank you.
[01:38:45.762 --> 01:38:46.583]  All right, there he goes.
[01:38:46.583 --> 01:38:48.204]  We're going to get our next guest on in a moment.
[01:38:48.204 --> 01:38:49.584]  And Jack Posobiec is going to be popping in.
[01:38:49.584 --> 01:38:53.467]  We'll probably have Larry Pinckney ride shotgun with us a little bit in the next hour with Posobiec.
[01:38:53.467 --> 01:38:54.227]  And then David Knight.
[01:38:54.227 --> 01:38:56.669]  And I don't usually disagree with Posobiec.
[01:38:56.669 --> 01:38:57.990]  I don't totally disagree with him.
[01:38:57.990 --> 01:39:11.439]  He went out tongue-in-cheek in Seattle, strangely enough, while I was there, and went out to this linen statue that was brought from Eastern Europe and put up there and said, hey, take this down if you're going to take down, you know, Thomas Jefferson, as they're trying to do.
[01:39:12.579 --> 01:39:17.960]  And my thought is, I want to have a historical statue of a bad guy.
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:27.743]  I mean, I'd want, if we could get statues of Hitler, put it in a historical museum, and I mean, you could have everybody in there from Robert E. Lee to George Washington to George Washington Carver.
[01:39:27.743 --> 01:39:30.024]  I mean, I don't think we should tear down any statues.
[01:39:30.024 --> 01:39:31.024]  Towns want to move.
[01:39:31.624 --> 01:39:32.525]  Or people don't like them.
[01:39:32.525 --> 01:39:34.668]  I think that's up for voters to do in the towns.
[01:39:34.668 --> 01:39:41.298]  But then in historical places, I mean, I've been to Rome and marched through and seen the tyrants and the good guys.
[01:39:41.298 --> 01:39:43.120]  I mean, it's just, it's a statue.
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:43.941]  It's history.
[01:39:45.225 --> 01:39:52.127]  And I personally just want to see it, but they're promoting all the statue fighting to get a war going on.
[01:39:52.127 --> 01:39:53.967]  That's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:39:53.967 --> 01:39:55.747]  But I don't have a dog in the hunt.
[01:39:55.747 --> 01:39:58.748]  I don't support the South and the Civil War.
[01:39:58.748 --> 01:40:00.989]  I mean, I've studied that situation.
[01:40:00.989 --> 01:40:06.170]  We were, as a country, manipulated into that in an attempt by British intelligence to break the country up.
[01:40:07.268 --> 01:40:22.865]  So, we'll talk to Larry Pinckney, blackactivistwg.org, the book, Saying No to Power, and he's the type of guy I really admire, like Martin Luther King, saying, judge people by the character of their deeds and what they do, and I've said this a million times.
[01:40:24.241 --> 01:40:30.529]  If it's a restaurant with good food, I don't care if it's Russians or black folks or whoever owns it or Japanese, I'm gonna go eat there.
[01:40:30.529 --> 01:40:32.712]  And if I like somebody's music, I'm gonna go listen to it.
[01:40:32.712 --> 01:40:42.824]  I don't care, you know, when I used to... I can't go out anymore because it's a security issue and I, you know, go to the Elephant Room with Rob Doo and listen to some good reggae.
[01:40:43.632 --> 01:40:45.673]  I listen to whatever I like.
[01:40:45.673 --> 01:40:46.593]  I eat whatever I like.
[01:40:46.593 --> 01:40:47.873]  I hang out with whoever I like.
[01:40:47.873 --> 01:40:51.094]  And it's just this assault of the race stuff.
[01:40:51.094 --> 01:40:59.997]  But then even if you counter it, you turn into it because the people that you're talking to see you as something else.
[01:40:59.997 --> 01:41:06.258]  So it's like, how do you get through to these people that a real Nazi collaborator is funding you?
[01:41:06.258 --> 01:41:07.799]  And he's done this in every other country.
[01:41:08.359 --> 01:41:10.941]  Playing Protestant off against Orthodox.
[01:41:10.941 --> 01:41:13.342]  Playing this African tribe off against that tribe.
[01:41:13.342 --> 01:41:15.884]  The Christians against, you know, against Animus.
[01:41:15.884 --> 01:41:18.345]  Or this group against that group.
[01:41:18.345 --> 01:41:19.566]  Or Sunnis against Shiite.
[01:41:19.566 --> 01:41:21.607]  And it's so stupid!
[01:41:21.607 --> 01:41:23.288]  And the big mega-elites are the ones doing it.
[01:41:23.288 --> 01:41:25.330]  So we're going to Larry Pinckney here in a moment.
[01:41:26.161 --> 01:41:28.003]  Some of the other stories coming up after he leaves us.
[01:41:28.003 --> 01:41:29.105]  Farage, U.S.
[01:41:29.105 --> 01:41:33.931]  leftist fighting historic monuments while real enemy terrorizes Europe.
[01:41:33.931 --> 01:41:36.154]  EU's actual Nazi plan.
[01:41:36.154 --> 01:41:38.076]  That's what's so crazy.
[01:41:38.076 --> 01:41:40.420]  And the Nazi plan was to actually play groups off against each other.
[01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:41.201]  It's kind of the British plan.
[01:41:42.452 --> 01:41:45.793]  IT staffers may have compromised sensitive data to foreign intelligence.
[01:41:45.793 --> 01:41:47.913]  We told you that six months ago.
[01:41:47.913 --> 01:41:54.434]  But the Awan brothers now indicted Debbie Wasserman Schultz, desperate, threatening the police to stop the investigation.
[01:41:54.434 --> 01:41:56.135]  We've played that video probably 20 times.
[01:41:56.135 --> 01:42:01.015]  Two former Wasserman Schultz IT aides indicted for conspiracy against the United States.
[01:42:01.015 --> 01:42:03.196]  So people wanted Sessions to move.
[01:42:03.196 --> 01:42:03.956]  He is.
[01:42:03.956 --> 01:42:05.336]  House Democrats.
[01:42:05.336 --> 01:42:06.957]  Office approved $120,000 write-off linked to Awan brothers.
[01:42:09.657 --> 01:42:14.560]  So, now suddenly Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer, comes out.
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:17.562]  White House lawyer Cobb predicts quick end to Mueller probe.
[01:42:17.562 --> 01:42:26.387]  Yeah, as soon as Trump announced Bannon was going, and as soon as he announced an Afghanistan war was going to probably get ramped up, suddenly they're starting to take the heat off Trump.
[01:42:28.988 --> 01:42:33.869]  So seven months in, Trump starts to go sideways, which I thought he'd go more sideways than this.
[01:42:33.869 --> 01:42:35.109]  Threatening his family, everything.
[01:42:35.109 --> 01:42:39.570]  I'm not defending, and I'm just telling you, we'll always tell you with our analysis what's happening.
[01:42:39.570 --> 01:42:42.251]  It looks like Trump's starting to go sideways.
[01:42:42.251 --> 01:42:44.051]  And notice the pressure's off.
[01:42:44.051 --> 01:42:47.872]  Because they said, okay, we didn't find any Russia, now it's anything financial.
[01:42:47.872 --> 01:42:50.792]  Your family, your renters, everybody in your campaign.
[01:42:50.792 --> 01:42:55.954]  We find a bounced check, we've got a grand jury to indict you right now.
[01:42:55.954 --> 01:42:57.814]  So we can all sit here and say, okay, Trump, you know.
[01:42:59.155 --> 01:43:00.256]  What are you doing going sideways?
[01:43:00.256 --> 01:43:02.097]  Well, are you in the position he's in?
[01:43:02.097 --> 01:43:09.401]  And look, I don't have pleasure getting up here saying that from all our sources, we're starting to see some sideways action here.
[01:43:09.401 --> 01:43:18.385]  It's still a lot better than Hillary and globalism and all the rest of it, but once you start paying the pirate, once you start going sideways, the sky's the limit.
[01:43:18.385 --> 01:43:19.506]  We're going to Larry Pinckney in a moment.
[01:43:19.506 --> 01:43:22.148]  We'll do this a little bit in the next hour.
[01:43:22.148 --> 01:43:26.250]  One of my favorite guests, and Darren McGreen is such a great producer, and I told him, I said, I want Pinckney on every week.
[01:43:27.284 --> 01:43:34.809]  But I said, we gotta get a bunch of other guests on that Pinckney recommends, too, because I want to get more and more people on.
[01:43:34.809 --> 01:43:37.750]  But then the question is, is there somebody as smart as Pinckney out there?
[01:43:37.750 --> 01:43:39.672]  So we'll talk to him here in just a moment.
[01:43:39.672 --> 01:43:46.115]  Larry Pinckney, Black Activist, WG.org, NewsWars.com is our news site.
[01:43:46.115 --> 01:43:46.476]  Briefly.
[01:43:47.369 --> 01:43:53.515]  If you want to fund this operation and get great products, then InfoWareStore.com is where it all starts.
[01:43:53.515 --> 01:43:57.760]  Water filtration, air filtration, those big specials are going to have to end tomorrow.
[01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:00.823]  A lot of these products are selling out in the BuzzFeed special.
[01:44:02.268 --> 01:44:03.889]  So, and we're not associated with BuzzFeed, folks.
[01:44:03.889 --> 01:44:06.390]  It's a joke, because they've been trying to, you know, get us to shut down.
[01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:12.912]  They tested our products, found they're the cleanest out there, and exactly as we advertised, and the very best quality, and they didn't even know what to do.
[01:44:12.912 --> 01:44:15.393]  So, Brain Force Plus is selling out, 55% off.
[01:44:15.393 --> 01:44:18.474]  DNA Force is selling out, 20% off.
[01:44:18.474 --> 01:44:20.055]  It'll be sold out for over a month.
[01:44:20.055 --> 01:44:22.456]  Silver Bullet is selling out, 66% off.
[01:44:22.456 --> 01:44:23.516]  Knockout is selling out.
[01:44:23.516 --> 01:44:25.177]  The Sleep Aid, 50% off.
[01:44:25.177 --> 01:44:26.878]  Michael ZX has sold out.
[01:44:27.458 --> 01:44:32.441]  Michael ZX, the antifungal, other part of the equation of biome defense, has sold out.
[01:44:32.441 --> 01:44:36.264]  Survival Shield X2, 55% off the good halogen.
[01:44:36.264 --> 01:44:37.865]  Very close to selling out.
[01:44:37.865 --> 01:44:40.807]  Secret 12, we sell the highest quality in the country.
[01:44:40.807 --> 01:44:43.049]  At $17.76, you can't beat it.
[01:44:43.049 --> 01:44:46.671]  Bio True Selenium, 29% off, $17.76.
[01:44:46.671 --> 01:44:51.575]  This is the last day to get 50% off on high quality, affordable food with promo code GOBLIN.
[01:44:51.575 --> 01:44:52.015]  It's a joke.
[01:44:53.348 --> 01:44:57.630]  New Super Blue Mouthwash, 11% off, with the iodine, with the colloidal silver.
[01:44:57.630 --> 01:45:02.752]  Caveman, with the bone broth, the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the bee pollen, and so much more.
[01:45:02.752 --> 01:45:05.653]  30% off now in strawberry, natural flavor as well.
[01:45:05.653 --> 01:45:07.533]  Alexa Pure Water Filter, 25% off.
[01:45:07.533 --> 01:45:09.334]  Alexa Pure Breeze, 25% off.
[01:45:09.334 --> 01:45:11.635]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, 33% off.
[01:45:11.635 --> 01:45:13.056]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:45:13.056 --> 01:45:16.897]  Okay, we are now going to Larry Pinckney.
[01:45:16.897 --> 01:45:21.159]  But I want to thank you all for your support, and I want to thank you all for your prayers.
[01:45:22.284 --> 01:45:24.386]  Because we're up against a scientific takeover.
[01:45:24.386 --> 01:45:26.687]  They've already announced the robots are going to replace everybody.
[01:45:26.687 --> 01:45:30.170]  They're suppressing all this live extension.
[01:45:30.170 --> 01:45:34.213]  I know for a fact Trump wants to try to release a lot of this technology to create the economy.
[01:45:34.213 --> 01:45:35.755]  He's being blocked.
[01:45:35.755 --> 01:45:40.678]  And it's a very, very sad moment with the CIA openly saying on CNN that they're prepared to kill him.
[01:45:40.678 --> 01:45:42.540]  He's been told they're prepared to kill him.
[01:45:42.540 --> 01:45:44.661]  And the question is, will he blink?
[01:45:44.661 --> 01:45:45.842]  Or is he compromising?
[01:45:45.842 --> 01:45:47.964]  Because he comes in demanding everything.
[01:45:47.964 --> 01:45:49.966]  That's the art of the deal, then ends up getting a lie.
[01:45:50.589 --> 01:45:53.351]  Well, I don't think the globals are going to let Trump survive.
[01:45:53.351 --> 01:46:05.477]  Even if he thinks they're going to tame them, they want to destroy him as a symbol and then hold him up as a white supremacist to create more division and wreck everything that people like Martin Luther King and others work for.
[01:46:05.477 --> 01:46:15.643]  But Larry Pinckney, a founding member of the original Black Panthers, not the new George Soros-funded KKK-style group, but the original one, Larry Pinckney joins us.
[01:46:15.643 --> 01:46:18.164]  Again, the book, Saying No to Power.
[01:46:18.164 --> 01:46:19.085]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[01:46:20.336 --> 01:46:21.577]  Well, thank you, my brother.
[01:46:21.577 --> 01:46:29.383]  First and foremost, I want to begin by saying I want to send my love and my strength to a number of people with InfoWars.
[01:46:29.383 --> 01:46:37.630]  That's Darren McGreen, David Knight, Roger Stone, Alejandra, and of course, the entire InfoWars crew.
[01:46:37.630 --> 01:46:41.092]  Our job is very, very difficult.
[01:46:41.092 --> 01:46:46.697]  Our job calls for us to, how shall I put this, have
[01:46:47.313 --> 01:46:57.837]  An intensified, intensified, dedication to the liberation of all of our people, black, white, brown, red, and yellow.
[01:46:57.837 --> 01:47:08.280]  And I want to make something perfectly clear, perfectly clear, crystal clear, as Stokely Carmichael used to say, crystal clear, alright?
[01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:13.202]  That we are not dealing with anti-fascists.
[01:47:14.409 --> 01:47:15.009]  All right?
[01:47:15.009 --> 01:47:19.050]  We are dealing with neo-liberal fascists.
[01:47:19.050 --> 01:47:22.591]  They are neo-liberal fascists.
[01:47:22.591 --> 01:47:28.592]  Stop accepting the narrative of these neo-liberal fascists.
[01:47:28.592 --> 01:47:34.293]  The Soros-Obama-Clinton machine, plus the deep state.
[01:47:34.293 --> 01:47:35.973]  What are they about?
[01:47:35.973 --> 01:47:40.594]  They are ahistorical, non-critically thinking lunatics.
[01:47:41.201 --> 01:47:46.683]  Controlled by the Soros-Obama-Clinton machine and the deep state.
[01:47:46.683 --> 01:47:49.063]  And what is their objective?
[01:47:49.063 --> 01:47:57.926]  Their objective is to revise history in their own image and ultimately to destroy our nation.
[01:47:57.926 --> 01:47:59.906]  I say no to that.
[01:47:59.906 --> 01:48:02.007]  Our nation has many problems.
[01:48:02.007 --> 01:48:05.048]  But it is our nation.
[01:48:05.048 --> 01:48:05.688]  Our nation.
[01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:15.305]  And that is what we meant in the original Black Panther Party when we said all power to the people, be they black, white, brown, red, or yellow.
[01:48:15.305 --> 01:48:16.526]  Do not succumb!
[01:48:17.355 --> 01:48:19.677]  To the neoliberal fascist.
[01:48:19.677 --> 01:48:21.938]  My brother, I'm sorry, I got a little carried away.
[01:48:21.938 --> 01:48:22.278]  No, no, no.
[01:48:22.278 --> 01:48:22.859]  Please do it.
[01:48:22.859 --> 01:48:23.379]  Please do it.
[01:48:23.379 --> 01:48:24.259]  Because I'll jump in any time.
[01:48:24.259 --> 01:48:25.780]  This is riveting truth.
[01:48:25.780 --> 01:48:28.422]  In fact, the establishment calls themselves neoliberal.
[01:48:28.422 --> 01:48:33.405]  You're using the real term they use in political science that I've not even heard in years.
[01:48:33.405 --> 01:48:34.666]  I'm glad you brought that up.
[01:48:34.666 --> 01:48:36.127]  Explain what neoliberal is.
[01:48:36.127 --> 01:48:37.348]  And they've got an admitted plan.
[01:48:38.621 --> 01:48:39.041]  Right.
[01:48:39.041 --> 01:48:56.792]  Neoliberalism is essentially, and I'm going to be very blunt, is essentially an ideology, or what I call an idiotology, an ideology that says we are going to push a certain narrative that says we are open and free.
[01:48:56.792 --> 01:48:59.954]  When in point of fact, it's just the opposite.
[01:48:59.954 --> 01:49:02.956]  They are not, quote unquote, liberals.
[01:49:02.956 --> 01:49:05.717]  They are neoliberals.
[01:49:05.717 --> 01:49:08.219]  They are, and what do I mean, neo, new?
[01:49:09.073 --> 01:49:17.417]  New liberals in the sense that what they want to do is to control the narrative of all people, black, white, brown, red, and yellow.
[01:49:17.417 --> 01:49:17.857]  Exactly.
[01:49:17.857 --> 01:49:21.679]  Martin Luther King is the anti-neoliberal, and that's why he got killed.
[01:49:21.679 --> 01:49:25.841]  Because he said, it's off what you do, what you stand for, who you are.
[01:49:25.841 --> 01:49:27.361]  True individualism.
[01:49:27.361 --> 01:49:28.102]  Well, no, no, no.
[01:49:28.102 --> 01:49:29.382]  They want to control language.
[01:49:29.382 --> 01:49:31.343]  They want to divide everybody.
[01:49:31.343 --> 01:49:32.464]  It's a scientific plan.
[01:49:33.462 --> 01:49:37.265]  Right, and you know, let me be blunt about some things.
[01:49:37.265 --> 01:49:45.750]  One, many of us, including myself by the way, did not support George W. Bush or Barack Obama.
[01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:51.374]  But we did not call for either of them to be assassinated.
[01:49:51.374 --> 01:49:52.915]  Think about that!
[01:49:52.915 --> 01:50:02.141]  But here we are in the 21st century, in the year 2017, and they're calling for the Chief Executive, whether you like him or not!
[01:50:02.865 --> 01:50:04.486]  To be assassinated.
[01:50:04.486 --> 01:50:07.208]  This is manipulated.
[01:50:07.208 --> 01:50:10.790]  Deep state manipulated insanity.
[01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:12.912]  That's why I... Exactly, exactly.
[01:50:12.912 --> 01:50:17.575]  How can people claim they're anti-establishment when the entire power structure wants Trump dead?
[01:50:17.575 --> 01:50:20.037]  Only because he's just simply doing what he wants to do.
[01:50:20.037 --> 01:50:22.738]  Whether he's good or bad, he really is the president right now.
[01:50:22.738 --> 01:50:26.261]  And unfortunately, let's skip this one break, but no more today.
[01:50:26.261 --> 01:50:29.303]  Unfortunately though, it looks like he's starting to cave with the pressure.
[01:50:29.303 --> 01:50:32.285]  And I can't blame him, but man, this is crazy.
[01:50:33.237 --> 01:50:39.259]  But whether he caves to the pressure or not, I hope he doesn't, but if he does, we the people...
[01:50:39.981 --> 01:50:45.645]  We the people, black, white, brown, red, and yellow, we the people will not cave to the press.
[01:50:45.645 --> 01:50:46.326]  That's right.
[01:50:46.326 --> 01:50:52.470]  The vomit stream media, and I repeat, vomit stream media, they are liars.
[01:50:52.470 --> 01:50:56.032]  They have been liars since as long as I've been alive.
[01:50:56.032 --> 01:51:02.277]  I remember them lying in the 50s and the 60s and the 70s, and they're lying even more.
[01:51:02.277 --> 01:51:04.318]  And then they talk about Boston.
[01:51:04.318 --> 01:51:04.979]  Boston?
[01:51:05.639 --> 01:51:09.242]  One of the most racist cities in this country?
[01:51:09.242 --> 01:51:11.945]  Boston, Philadelphia, New York.
[01:51:11.945 --> 01:51:19.030]  Three of the most insidiously racist and actively racist cities in this nation.
[01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:19.551]  In.
[01:51:19.551 --> 01:51:20.171]  This.
[01:51:20.171 --> 01:51:20.892]  Nation.
[01:51:20.892 --> 01:51:22.033]  Not the South!
[01:51:22.702 --> 01:51:23.863]  The North!
[01:51:23.863 --> 01:51:24.684]  All right?
[01:51:24.684 --> 01:51:27.206]  Let's get real, brothers and sisters.
[01:51:27.206 --> 01:51:30.668]  Let's understand what time it really is.
[01:51:30.668 --> 01:51:32.349]  That's all I have to say, my brother.
[01:51:32.349 --> 01:51:33.610]  That's what's happening.
[01:51:33.610 --> 01:51:39.295]  Well, did you know that Robert E. Lee was more popular in the North after the Civil War than he was in the South?
[01:51:39.295 --> 01:51:44.018]  And I don't want to get into the stereotypes, but they're usually there because part of it's true.
[01:51:44.018 --> 01:51:48.962]  I never heard racist talk until I traveled to the North, and I'm not bashing great folks from the North.
[01:51:48.962 --> 01:51:49.483]  It's just that
[01:51:50.163 --> 01:51:56.964]  I, I, it was like an embarrassment racism in the South and like the whole Christian ethos was, you know, we've been bad, we can't be bad.
[01:51:56.964 --> 01:52:02.686]  The liberals have hijacked that to then guilt folks to go along with their agenda because people are actually listening a lot of times in the South.
[01:52:02.686 --> 01:52:05.066]  Though there is some racism here, obviously it's bad.
[01:52:05.066 --> 01:52:06.726]  It's tribalism, you know, divide and conquer.
[01:52:06.726 --> 01:52:12.408]  But when I found to the North, all the sides have been turned into racist against each other as a tool of control.
[01:52:12.408 --> 01:52:14.728]  And it's so obvious and it's so idiotic.
[01:52:14.728 --> 01:52:18.929]  And the Democratic Party acts like Donald Trump or myself or somebody are behind these
[01:52:19.389 --> 01:52:20.591]  The key word is establishment.
[01:52:20.591 --> 01:52:21.752]  The key word is establishment.
[01:52:35.518 --> 01:52:40.382]  That's why the White House, whether you like it or not, is hated.
[01:52:40.382 --> 01:52:41.602]  Who is it hated by?
[01:52:41.602 --> 01:52:43.564]  The establishment.
[01:52:43.564 --> 01:52:47.227]  Who are trying to take the White House down?
[01:52:47.227 --> 01:52:48.648]  The establishment.
[01:52:48.648 --> 01:52:50.349]  I'm not saying that Trump
[01:52:50.989 --> 01:52:53.031]  Is this great whatever?
[01:52:53.031 --> 01:52:53.491]  I hate it!
[01:53:14.991 --> 01:53:16.212]  That's right, that's right.
[01:53:16.212 --> 01:53:17.032]  And you know what?
[01:53:17.032 --> 01:53:20.775]  How come we never hear about Robert W. Byrd?
[01:53:20.775 --> 01:53:21.235]  Huh?
[01:53:21.235 --> 01:53:22.376]  That Democrat!
[01:53:22.376 --> 01:53:23.416]  That Hillary!
[01:53:23.416 --> 01:53:24.877]  No, I didn't say Hillary.
[01:53:24.877 --> 01:53:26.558]  I said Hillary Clinton!
[01:53:26.558 --> 01:53:31.982]  You know, that same Hillary Clinton who called black people super predators.
[01:53:31.982 --> 01:53:32.802]  Oh yes!
[01:53:32.802 --> 01:53:34.464]  Wake up, people!
[01:53:34.464 --> 01:53:36.245]  Wake up, my brothers and sisters!
[01:53:36.245 --> 01:53:39.407]  Be you black, white, brown, red, or yellow.
[01:53:39.407 --> 01:53:40.307]  Wake up!
[01:53:40.307 --> 01:53:41.308]  Do not be duped!
[01:53:41.986 --> 01:53:57.592]  By this insidious, and I do mean insidious, effort by the Deep State, by the Democratic Party, and establishment Republicans to destroy every decent ideal, ideal
[01:54:00.534 --> 01:54:06.596]  Let me ask you this then, Larry Pinkney, again, founding member of the original Black Panther Party, who again, the media misrepresented what they said, what they did.
[01:54:06.596 --> 01:54:10.438]  Just like they do to me, they say I'm calling for violence, I'm calling for the opposite.
[01:54:10.438 --> 01:54:15.660]  But they say I'm trying to organize a revolution, and violently, they're the ones trying to organize one, and the government, these corrupt elements.
[01:54:15.660 --> 01:54:21.683]  Larry, big picture, because I've been asking the questions here, but big picture, how do you think it's going globally?
[01:54:21.683 --> 01:54:23.184]  Where do you see things going in the future?
[01:54:23.184 --> 01:54:25.965]  What's your gut tell you about where we are as a society?
[01:54:27.099 --> 01:54:37.443]  My gut tells me that where we are as a society is we are at a very definitive moment, historically speaking.
[01:54:37.443 --> 01:54:39.323]  We are at a crossroads.
[01:54:39.323 --> 01:54:43.705]  We will either allow ourselves to be duped and taken in,
[01:54:44.426 --> 01:54:53.549]  Just like so many people, including black people, have been taken in by the so-called Democrats.
[01:54:53.549 --> 01:54:57.350]  You know, that party that Brother Malcolm called Dixiecrats.
[01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:58.290]  The racists.
[01:54:58.290 --> 01:55:05.272]  The ones who were responsible for putting in and praising people like Robert Byrd.
[01:55:05.272 --> 01:55:06.032]  Who was U.S.
[01:55:06.032 --> 01:55:07.452]  Senator Robert Byrd?
[01:55:07.452 --> 01:55:12.774]  He was not only a Klan member and loved by Hillary, he was a Klan recruiter!
[01:55:13.294 --> 01:55:13.735]  Come on!
[01:55:13.735 --> 01:55:15.056]  Stop it, people!
[01:55:15.056 --> 01:55:16.697]  We need to wake up!
[01:55:16.697 --> 01:55:18.539]  Now, globally?
[01:55:18.539 --> 01:55:24.705]  Globally, I see people, oh my God, they are waking up all over the country.
[01:55:24.705 --> 01:55:26.127]  All over the world, I should say.
[01:55:26.127 --> 01:55:28.349]  So people are waking up to globalism, undoubtedly.
[01:55:29.175 --> 01:55:40.958]  Yes, yes, but in this country, we need to link it all together and understand that the name of their game is to divide us against each other.
[01:55:40.958 --> 01:55:45.459]  You know, they talk about fascism, they are the fascists!
[01:55:45.459 --> 01:55:51.220]  The Soros, Obama, Clinton machine in the deep state, they are the fascists!
[01:55:51.220 --> 01:55:58.562]  And Larry, I totally agree with you, but let's say back in the 60s or 70s when attacks on blacks were at record high levels.
[01:56:00.078 --> 01:56:05.460]  Still, even if you're not anti-white, if you're going into a racist white area, you've got to know there are people that want to come after you.
[01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:26.426]  What do we do then when the left then hypes up white antifa attacking white folks, and they get black folks to go out, the new Black Panther Party says, don't rob in your neighborhood, go kill a white person, then that starts happening, and then white people that have never been racist start going, well what do we do, what do we do, and then I don't even know what to do, because I know it's all a plan to control us, what do you do?
[01:56:27.284 --> 01:56:29.465]  You defend yourselves!
[01:56:29.465 --> 01:56:32.066]  Do you black, white, brown, red or yellow?
[01:56:32.066 --> 01:56:44.289]  To black people, my brothers and sisters, to white people, brown people, you know, red people, yellow people, defend yourselves, not only physically, but psychologically, huh?
[01:56:44.289 --> 01:56:45.790]  Don't go for the ghost!
[01:56:46.405 --> 01:56:48.546]  Don't go for the ghost.
[01:56:48.546 --> 01:56:51.308]  In other words, don't be fooled again.
[01:56:51.308 --> 01:56:53.690]  Like the who, the song by the who.
[01:56:53.690 --> 01:56:55.651]  Don't be fooled again.
[01:56:55.651 --> 01:56:56.591]  Okay?
[01:56:56.591 --> 01:56:59.373]  And don't let them play us off.
[01:56:59.373 --> 01:57:06.037]  Any differences that we have, we can work out and we'll damn well work out for ourselves.
[01:57:06.037 --> 01:57:07.498]  For ourselves!
[01:57:07.498 --> 01:57:09.840]  We don't need the deep state.
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:10.760]  The government.
[01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:11.481]  You dig it?
[01:57:11.481 --> 01:57:13.602]  We don't need the sorrows.
[01:57:14.142 --> 01:57:16.966]  I've talked to all the big insiders that are patriots.
[01:57:16.966 --> 01:57:17.907]  They say that's it.
[01:57:17.907 --> 01:57:20.851]  They said, listen, the establishment's there.
[01:57:20.851 --> 01:57:21.993]  They're not even a party.
[01:57:21.993 --> 01:57:24.777]  They're in control for at least 100 years.
[01:57:24.777 --> 01:57:28.362]  Kennedy's problem was he tried to actually be president, and he wasn't perfect either.
[01:57:28.362 --> 01:57:29.023]  He had problems.
[01:57:29.463 --> 01:57:30.304]  Lord did he.
[01:57:30.304 --> 01:57:36.647]  But the point is, he actually tried to be president, tried to cut taxes, tried to have real civil rights, and they didn't want that, so they killed him.
[01:57:36.647 --> 01:57:40.730]  Just like they killed Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy and all the rest of it.
[01:57:40.730 --> 01:57:47.354]  And so it's the same thing again, and it's so incredibly obvious that they're just doing it again.
[01:57:47.354 --> 01:57:48.754]  Right.
[01:57:48.754 --> 01:57:52.637]  And we must not let them get away this time.
[01:57:52.637 --> 01:57:54.678]  This time must be different.
[01:57:55.265 --> 01:57:57.407]  This is the 21st century.
[01:57:57.407 --> 01:57:59.808]  This time must be different.
[01:57:59.808 --> 01:58:02.190]  My brother, we must not.
[01:58:02.190 --> 01:58:07.614]  None of us, black, white, brown, red, or yellow, we must not let them get away with it.
[01:58:07.614 --> 01:58:08.535]  We are not fools.
[01:58:09.221 --> 01:58:13.626]  We may not have PhDs, but that's probably why we're not fooled.
[01:58:13.626 --> 01:58:14.747]  You understand?
[01:58:14.747 --> 01:58:16.890]  We must not let them get away with it.
[01:58:16.890 --> 01:58:19.232]  I say all power to the people!
[01:58:19.232 --> 01:58:20.994]  All right, stay there, absolutely.
[01:58:20.994 --> 01:58:24.739]  Larry Pinckney is our guest, blackactivistwg.org, the book.
[01:58:25.419 --> 01:58:28.460]  Say, uh, saying no to power, everybody should get it.
[01:58:28.460 --> 01:58:33.162]  Even if you're already awake, it's a great book to give to somebody else or donate to your library so you can reach hundreds of people.
[01:58:33.162 --> 01:58:37.544]  I'm gonna come back and bring up to him what happened to me in, uh, Seattle.
[01:58:37.544 --> 01:58:39.744]  I mean, just, I couldn't even go on the street now.
[01:58:39.744 --> 01:58:41.165]  Had a guy actually want to run me over.
[01:58:41.165 --> 01:58:44.146]  Uh, it was just, these people are crazy.
[01:58:47.652 --> 01:58:49.254]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:58:49.254 --> 01:58:51.836]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to secure your canister.

[01:59:36.868 --> 01:59:38.328]  That means it's clean.
[01:59:38.328 --> 01:59:39.229]  That means it's pure.
[01:59:39.449 --> 01:59:41.130]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:04.773 --> 02:00:13.337]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:13.337 --> 02:00:20.239]  Coming up, Jack Mazzobo's gonna join us, and hopefully Mr. Picnic can ride shotgun a little bit.
[02:00:20.239 --> 02:00:27.883]  I gotta be honest, having hundreds of people run up and say, F you Nazi, didn't upset me in the way they thought.
[02:00:27.883 --> 02:00:33.385]  They thought it was a shunning process, a peer-pressured process, because I guess that's what they're basically based in.
[02:00:34.898 --> 02:00:50.049]  is a bunch of follower mentality stuff, but it was, it's a fact, I don't say this to virtue signal, it was about 98% white people, white men that would say, F you racist Nazi, threatened to physically attack me, throw coffee in my face.
[02:00:50.049 --> 02:00:54.932]  And then I had four or five black guys come over and be like, blah, blah, blah.
[02:00:54.932 --> 02:00:56.353]  I mean, are you really into this bad stuff?
[02:00:56.353 --> 02:00:57.013]  And I explained, no.
[02:00:57.013 --> 02:00:58.835]  And then I'd explain a few things that actually listened to me.
[02:00:59.588 --> 02:01:03.451]  I don't know what it says about the psychology, then they nod their head and walk off.
[02:01:03.451 --> 02:01:09.635]  I'd have women come over and act like they were nice, then go, I hate you, you're scum.
[02:01:09.635 --> 02:01:11.536]  Like trying to hurt me.
[02:01:11.536 --> 02:01:16.519]  All because they've seen this stuff on the news, Tom Brokaw saying, I'm deeply racist.
[02:01:16.519 --> 02:01:22.063]  And it doesn't hurt me in the way they think it does, it hurts me that our national news is so controlled.
[02:01:23.346 --> 02:01:37.846]  And then, like I said, Mike Zimmerman, last night, because we had bound our hotel rooms together, with my wife and, you know, one of my children we took on the trip and the rest of it, and the nanny, we're all in one room, you know, waiting to go to the airport about six o'clock, we weren't going to leave until eight, and I said, I'm going to go eat.
[02:01:37.846 --> 02:01:39.208]  And he said, man, don't do it.
[02:01:40.856 --> 02:01:42.638]  I said, listen, it's a free country, I'm gonna do it.
[02:01:42.638 --> 02:01:50.006]  I go out there and a guy basically acts like, or tries to run me over with his Range Rover, then rolls his window down and starts saying, F you Nazi, another white guy.
[02:01:50.006 --> 02:01:52.388]  At that point, I just said, man, you're a coward.
[02:01:52.388 --> 02:01:53.970]  Why don't you get out of the car?
[02:01:53.970 --> 02:01:55.391]  And I'm not looking for trouble, but I mean...
[02:01:56.237 --> 02:01:59.038]  You know, that guy that got out of that car, man, he already tried to hit me with his car.
[02:01:59.038 --> 02:02:00.619]  I mean, these people are nuts!
[02:02:00.619 --> 02:02:03.700]  They're in a real world, but they say it and run off.
[02:02:03.700 --> 02:02:12.263]  What does that say about their mentality from all the experiences you've been through, all the murders you witnessed against you guys when you were, you know, trying to get your message out?
[02:02:12.263 --> 02:02:13.944]  I mean, it's just, things are so volatile now.
[02:02:14.994 --> 02:02:18.755]  Well, what it says to me is they don't have a mentality.
[02:02:18.755 --> 02:02:20.876]  Brother Alex, come on brother!
[02:02:20.876 --> 02:02:23.036]  They don't have a mentality.
[02:02:23.036 --> 02:02:32.439]  Essentially, what these people are, and I'll say it again, are ahistorical, non-critically thinking lunatics.
[02:02:32.439 --> 02:02:32.999]  Okay?
[02:02:32.999 --> 02:02:34.400]  Let's be honest.
[02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:36.800]  Well then why are 97% of them white males?
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:41.822]  I don't want to get into white male bashing, but the people saying F you white male are white guys.
[02:02:42.793 --> 02:02:43.933]  You know why?
[02:02:43.933 --> 02:02:47.394]  Because they are personally insecure.
[02:02:47.394 --> 02:02:48.034]  You dig?
[02:02:48.034 --> 02:02:49.594]  Come on, let's be real!
[02:02:49.594 --> 02:03:04.338]  They're personally insecure, and whatever they were trying to get, they didn't get, so they figured, or if I switch and I become this supposedly anti-fascist, fascist, you hear me?
[02:03:04.338 --> 02:03:05.778]  Anti-fascist, fascist?
[02:03:06.358 --> 02:03:10.340]  Okay, maybe I can feel secure with myself.
[02:03:10.340 --> 02:03:11.361]  Excuse me?
[02:03:11.361 --> 02:03:13.422]  No, that's not reality.
[02:03:13.422 --> 02:03:15.363]  That's what people do.
[02:03:15.363 --> 02:03:30.192]  I often ask myself, how can white people, alright, or non-black people, be they white or turquoise, sit back and say, only black lives matter, or, quote, black lives matter.
[02:03:30.652 --> 02:03:31.413]  All right?
[02:03:31.413 --> 02:03:37.223]  I go, my God, how can they negate their own humanity that way?
[02:03:37.223 --> 02:03:45.016]  Why don't they say that every life is precious and that when we lose one, we lose all?
[02:03:45.990 --> 02:03:50.273]  You know, I myself am asking questions to myself.
[02:03:50.273 --> 02:03:50.813]  Alright?
[02:03:50.813 --> 02:03:52.314]  But it's a game.
[02:03:52.314 --> 02:03:55.816]  It's the game being played by that machine.
[02:03:55.816 --> 02:03:59.098]  By that Soros-Obama-Clinton machine.
[02:03:59.098 --> 02:04:05.462]  Obama, by the way, is the biggest betrayer in the 21st century of all people.
[02:04:05.462 --> 02:04:06.683]  Not just black people.
[02:04:07.429 --> 02:04:09.910]  But of all people, okay?
[02:04:09.910 --> 02:04:13.331]  And, you know, the time will come for him to pay this bill.
[02:04:13.331 --> 02:04:14.612]  Larry Pink, let's do a short segment.
[02:04:14.612 --> 02:04:21.755]  I want to come back in the longer segment and spend some time with you on the legacy of Obama, who I felt like an idiot.
[02:04:21.755 --> 02:04:24.936]  I was kind of neutral between him and McCain, and I thought maybe we'll bring folks together.
[02:04:24.936 --> 02:04:26.277]  I'm so naive.
[02:04:26.277 --> 02:04:28.798]  But then you expand on that, the cold-blooded betrayal.
[02:04:28.798 --> 02:04:31.459]  Like you said, when you dehumanize other groups,
[02:04:32.159 --> 02:04:32.319]  Exactly.
[02:04:32.319 --> 02:04:32.680]  Think about it.

[02:07:55.847 --> 02:08:02.350]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:25.529 --> 02:08:27.230]  Just like yesterday!
[02:08:57.392 --> 02:09:01.759]  Won't get fooled again!
[02:09:01.759 --> 02:09:03.863]  We don't get fooled again!
[02:09:03.863 --> 02:09:05.946]  Meet the new boss!
[02:09:05.946 --> 02:09:08.550]  Same as the old boss!
[02:09:08.550 --> 02:09:09.372]  InfoWars.com
[02:09:11.104 --> 02:09:11.865]  Let me tell you something.
[02:09:11.865 --> 02:09:14.047]  I saw the establishment hating Trump.
[02:09:14.047 --> 02:09:15.629]  The internal emails, they thought he was a joke.
[02:09:15.629 --> 02:09:16.370]  They thought they could beat him.
[02:09:16.370 --> 02:09:17.711]  Then they tried to steal the nomination.
[02:09:17.711 --> 02:09:20.835]  Then they tried to steal him being seated.
[02:09:20.835 --> 02:09:22.537]  Then they went into this whole Russia thing.
[02:09:22.537 --> 02:09:24.399]  Now they've gone into this whole race-based thing.
[02:09:24.399 --> 02:09:28.643]  Folks, behind the scenes, Donald Trump, and plus publicly, is far from a racist.
[02:09:29.384 --> 02:09:35.450]  In fact, he is kind of like an underdog guy that hates the establishment and wanted to be a billionaire on his own.
[02:09:35.450 --> 02:09:41.516]  And that's why they don't like him, is he thinks he's actually better than all these fat cats and is in there actually going after him.
[02:09:41.516 --> 02:09:44.859]  And he's delivered on so many fronts.
[02:09:44.859 --> 02:09:46.360]  And, you know, he's the bad boy.
[02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:51.826]  He's the evil guy you're not supposed to support when you turn on the same NBC news that tells you there were WMDs in Iraq.
[02:09:52.739 --> 02:10:00.542]  And then we fund radical Islam to overthrow all these secular nations and all these Muslim nations that are living in peace and that women can go to college and they're killing everybody.
[02:10:00.542 --> 02:10:05.023]  We're getting Jack Posobiec on the line right now in Texas, is the best part of the eclipse.
[02:10:05.023 --> 02:10:08.705]  Obviously it was the most intense in Oregon, but where we're at right now we can put on screen.
[02:10:09.565 --> 02:10:15.246]  Maybe behind me for TV viewers, just put up the Fox News feed if folks want to, or just any of the feeds.
[02:10:15.246 --> 02:10:21.908]  We've got a NASA feed as well, and show folks what's happening with the eclipse.
[02:10:21.908 --> 02:10:25.488]  Haven't had one of these over in North America since 1776.
[02:10:25.488 --> 02:10:31.970]  So we've got the Science Channel up there for you, and obviously we'll have replays of all this.
[02:10:31.970 --> 02:10:35.030]  Just reminds us how huge our universe is that we're here in the middle of.
[02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:36.851]  But finishing up with Larry Pinckney.
[02:10:38.011 --> 02:11:04.450]  Larry Pinckney, just talking about Barack Obama, your former, one of the founders of the Black Panther Party, and then to see everything that Martin Luther King and yourself and so many others actually promoted, which I agree with, judge people on the content of their character, their deeds, not the color of their skin, where our children can, you know, in the future live together and, you know, come together and share all our great gifts together.
[02:11:06.735 --> 02:11:11.679]  They're taking Martin Luther King statues down and murals down at universities because he didn't mention trannies.
[02:11:11.679 --> 02:11:14.381]  Well, I don't dislike trannies.
[02:11:14.381 --> 02:11:16.302]  Point is, that wasn't even an issue then.
[02:11:16.302 --> 02:11:22.347]  It's this war on if they can take down Martin Luther King, that's a big mount to put on their wall.
[02:11:22.347 --> 02:11:25.969]  What you said earlier, it's about them controlling everything.
[02:11:25.969 --> 02:11:28.031]  The future, the past, the present.
[02:11:28.031 --> 02:11:28.591]  It's 1984.
[02:11:28.591 --> 02:11:34.096]  It's the model of absolute, total, and complete
[02:11:34.756 --> 02:11:36.218]  Annihilation of information.
[02:11:36.218 --> 02:11:40.723]  It's about being the priest of power, the priest of information.
[02:11:40.723 --> 02:11:42.085]  That's right, that's right.
[02:11:42.085 --> 02:11:50.275]  And you know, the reality is that these neoliberal fascists, let's be honest, they hate Dr. King.
[02:11:50.908 --> 02:11:52.389]  They hate Malcolm.
[02:11:52.389 --> 02:11:55.251]  They hate Viola de Wiesel.
[02:11:55.251 --> 02:12:07.278]  And if you don't know who Viola de Wiesel was, she was a white woman who was murdered by, she was assassinated, murdered, shot in the face by a KKK government agent.
[02:12:07.278 --> 02:12:08.479]  Alright?
[02:12:08.479 --> 02:12:09.860]  They hate these people.
[02:12:10.535 --> 02:12:15.541]  They are, and I keep emphasizing this, they are the neoliberal fascists.
[02:12:15.541 --> 02:12:23.910]  That's why they hate Dr. King, they hate Malcolm, they hate Viola Luizzo, alright?
[02:12:23.910 --> 02:12:28.856]  And if anyone is sort of wondering, like, okay, what's Larry talking about?
[02:12:28.856 --> 02:12:31.379]  Look, read Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:12:32.347 --> 02:12:37.612]  His latest article, I'm trying to remember what it was, but I tend to speak off the top of my own brain.
[02:12:37.612 --> 02:12:39.073]  We can pull it up right now.
[02:12:39.073 --> 02:12:45.479]  Yeah, his latest article by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, I mean, oh my god, incredible!
[02:12:45.479 --> 02:12:46.259]  Incredible!
[02:12:46.259 --> 02:12:47.981]  You want to know what's going on?
[02:12:47.981 --> 02:12:52.145]  Read Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, among others, among others.
[02:12:52.145 --> 02:12:52.305]  So,
[02:12:53.400 --> 02:13:05.232]  All I can say is that, you know, these neoliberal fascists, it's gotten to a point where it is totally insane.
[02:13:05.232 --> 02:13:08.355]  Antifa, Antifa, give me a break.
[02:13:08.355 --> 02:13:10.697]  They are the fascists.
[02:13:10.697 --> 02:13:14.581]  They are just as fascist as the Ku Klux Klan.
[02:13:14.581 --> 02:13:16.123]  And let's be honest.
[02:13:16.846 --> 02:13:29.553]  The everyday ordinary black, white, brown, red and yellow people just want to survive and have everyday bread and butter issues to take care of themselves and their families!
[02:13:29.553 --> 02:13:31.214]  And there's nothing wrong with that!
[02:13:31.214 --> 02:13:32.414]  And that's Trump's goal!
[02:13:32.414 --> 02:13:36.517]  That Trump is all about power back to the people and making people independent.
[02:13:36.517 --> 02:13:38.458]  And if you want to get into real affirmative action,
[02:13:39.477 --> 02:13:40.417]  It's come out.
[02:13:40.417 --> 02:13:41.478]  He's gone to those communities.
[02:13:41.478 --> 02:13:42.839]  He's told those companies.
[02:13:42.839 --> 02:13:43.699]  He's twisted arms.
[02:13:43.699 --> 02:13:46.360]  He said, you're going to move them right in the middle of these inner cities.
[02:13:46.360 --> 02:13:47.421]  You're going to get the incentives.
[02:13:47.421 --> 02:13:48.481]  You're going to move them from China.
[02:13:48.481 --> 02:13:49.662]  You're going to move them from India.
[02:13:49.662 --> 02:13:50.122]  You're going to move.
[02:13:50.122 --> 02:13:51.283]  And it started.
[02:13:51.283 --> 02:13:55.164]  It's happening because Trump understands that the engineers want us poor.
[02:13:55.164 --> 02:13:57.465]  They don't want us to be self-sufficient.
[02:13:57.465 --> 02:13:58.526]  That's right.
[02:13:58.526 --> 02:14:00.267]  They want us poor.
[02:14:00.267 --> 02:14:00.887]  Wake up!
[02:14:01.547 --> 02:14:08.092]  Well Larry Pinckney, we are launching a new weekly lineup of shows.
[02:14:08.092 --> 02:14:10.473]  I'd like to try to have you host one.
[02:14:10.473 --> 02:14:17.038]  We're also launching David Knight's new program, a new broadcast weekday mornings 8 to 11 a.m.
[02:14:17.038 --> 02:14:17.318]  Central.
[02:14:31.628 --> 02:14:33.150]  That's titled Real News.
[02:14:33.150 --> 02:14:42.801]  We're launching the War Room with Roger Stone and of course we've got Mike Cernovich and Owen Schroer, but I would like to really have you as a contributor just regularly.
[02:14:42.801 --> 02:14:46.325]  There's so many great guests that you get them on, a year passes by, you forget.
[02:14:47.352 --> 02:14:47.772]  Thank you, brother.
[02:14:47.772 --> 02:14:48.152]  Stay strong.
[02:14:48.152 --> 02:14:49.073]  All power to the people.
[02:14:49.073 --> 02:14:49.573]  Thank you very much.
[02:15:05.967 --> 02:15:06.388]  Thank you.
[02:15:06.388 --> 02:15:08.851]  Alright, now Jack Posobiec's with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:15:08.851 --> 02:15:11.014]  We're going to open the phones up at the bottom of the hour.
[02:15:11.014 --> 02:15:12.375]  Jack's going to be co-hosting with us.
[02:15:12.375 --> 02:15:13.817]  I'd like to also invite Jack.
[02:15:13.817 --> 02:15:15.660]  He's going to be a contributor more and more with InfoWaters.
[02:15:15.660 --> 02:15:22.348]  We're just getting everything up and launched and going here for an 18-hour-a-day live network here that we'll have.
[02:15:24.070 --> 02:15:30.056]  We'll be live 9-10 hours a day by the end of the year, then 18 hours a day by the middle of next year.
[02:15:30.056 --> 02:15:32.899]  It's really my goal, but I'm saying end of next year just to be safe.
[02:15:32.899 --> 02:15:35.361]  Once we get up and going, we can really expand rapidly.
[02:15:35.361 --> 02:15:36.882]  That's why the globalists are after us.
[02:15:36.882 --> 02:15:38.564]  That's why they're trying to shut us down.
[02:15:39.765 --> 02:15:40.905]  A lot of it's been hit or miss.
[02:15:40.905 --> 02:15:44.946]  You know, we keep winning, but it's just by the grace of God.
[02:15:44.946 --> 02:15:46.107]  It's not our smarts.
[02:15:46.107 --> 02:15:48.327]  It's not my will that's doing it.
[02:15:48.327 --> 02:15:49.727]  It's God's will.
[02:15:49.727 --> 02:15:53.048]  And I am a servant, a humble servant of God.
[02:15:53.048 --> 02:15:58.769]  I have a relationship with God and I have a relationship with life and a relationship with justice.
[02:15:58.769 --> 02:16:05.291]  And any things I've been able to do, it's all straight from God and straight from your support being obviously influenced by the Spirit.
[02:16:06.457 --> 02:16:06.697]  I think?
[02:16:25.538 --> 02:16:27.300]  With the craziest headlines.
[02:16:27.300 --> 02:16:29.142]  You've got to kick him out of the Navy.
[02:16:29.142 --> 02:16:30.724]  He's a security risk.
[02:16:30.724 --> 02:16:35.189]  The president likes him and retweeted him last week.
[02:16:35.189 --> 02:16:37.711]  And we'll show the tweet that the president tweeted here in a few minutes.
[02:16:37.711 --> 02:16:39.393]  But it's this upside down world.
[02:16:39.393 --> 02:16:43.638]  The commander in chief likes you so you're bad.
[02:16:43.638 --> 02:16:45.139]  This is this upside down world.
[02:16:46.141 --> 02:16:49.984]  And that we didn't get a chance to meet the day you were out in Seattle, I was out there.
[02:16:49.984 --> 02:16:52.646]  We're gonna play some of this at the bottom of the hour, a compilation.
[02:16:52.646 --> 02:16:55.308]  The frothing, we're gonna kill you, we're gonna get you.
[02:16:55.308 --> 02:16:57.630]  Guy tried to hit me with a car last night.
[02:16:57.630 --> 02:16:59.972]  I mean, this was mental illness world.
[02:17:00.928 --> 02:17:04.652]  And I know they were out there chanting when you were at the Lenin statue that they're going to kill you.
[02:17:04.652 --> 02:17:06.694]  And this is like women in business suits.
[02:17:06.694 --> 02:17:10.478]  I mean, this is a cult where they all radicalize each other.
[02:17:10.478 --> 02:17:11.940]  We got the shakeup at the White House.
[02:17:11.940 --> 02:17:14.482]  I mean, what is the state of our union right now?
[02:17:14.482 --> 02:17:20.088]  Because stuff is so exciting, so riveting, so edge of your seat, especially when you're in the arena now.
[02:17:20.088 --> 02:17:21.509]  I mean, where do we even begin?
[02:17:21.509 --> 02:17:22.831]  We got the total eclipse going on.
[02:17:25.180 --> 02:17:26.722]  Alex, you know, it's funny.
[02:17:26.722 --> 02:17:34.032]  I haven't talked very much publicly about my experience, my prior experience in the Naval Intelligence Service, and the reason being is OPSEC.
[02:17:34.611 --> 02:17:36.371]  It's operational security.
[02:17:36.371 --> 02:17:39.192]  That's what you do when you're a member of those services.
[02:17:39.192 --> 02:17:40.572]  You don't talk about it.
[02:17:40.572 --> 02:17:44.773]  You keep operational security to protect sources and methods for the United States government.
[02:17:44.773 --> 02:17:51.454]  But, if Deep State's gonna come out and blather about my experience and my background all over the world, then great, I'll accept that brand.
[02:17:51.454 --> 02:17:52.574]  You think I'm trying to hide it?
[02:17:52.574 --> 02:17:54.835]  I'm proud of the fact that I served our country.
[02:17:54.835 --> 02:17:58.055]  I'm proud of the fact that the Commander-in-Chief has called out some of my work.
[02:17:58.055 --> 02:18:00.736]  And I'm proud of the fact that I served in the Naval Intelligence Community.
[02:18:01.212 --> 02:18:03.754]  Now, as far as these people in Seattle, we're seeing it.
[02:18:03.754 --> 02:18:06.036]  Alex, I saw it a couple of days before you were there.
[02:18:06.036 --> 02:18:07.278]  They treated me the same way.
[02:18:07.278 --> 02:18:09.740]  These people were crawling up to me.
[02:18:09.740 --> 02:18:12.903]  They saw me calling out their Vladimir Lenin statue.
[02:18:12.903 --> 02:18:17.607]  This is like the leader of the alt-left Marxist cult out there.
[02:18:17.607 --> 02:18:20.770]  And the minute I called it out, they started screaming at me, said they were going to kill me.
[02:18:21.050 --> 02:18:22.771]  And I said, guys, this is a statue.
[02:18:22.771 --> 02:18:23.732]  This guy's genocide.
[02:18:23.732 --> 02:18:28.275]  This guy, genocide to the Chinese, the Cambodians, the Muslims, the Tibetans.
[02:18:28.275 --> 02:18:29.896]  This is what Marxists came from.
[02:18:29.896 --> 02:18:32.278]  And you guys want to have a statue to this in your city?
[02:18:32.278 --> 02:18:38.182]  And these people, I'm telling you, Alex, the way they smelled, the way they looked, they were completely just twisted.
[02:18:38.182 --> 02:18:38.762]  They came up to me.
[02:18:38.762 --> 02:18:40.143]  They said, oh, no, it's OK.
[02:18:40.143 --> 02:18:41.284]  It has to remind us, Jack.
[02:18:41.284 --> 02:18:42.124]  It has to remind us.
[02:18:42.124 --> 02:18:44.146]  Why do you want that to remind you?
[02:18:44.146 --> 02:18:47.168]  There were a few people that came up to me that were locals that said, Jack,
[02:18:47.768 --> 02:19:02.711]  We're Christians and every day we go to church we have to drive by this statue and we see the reminder of someone who persecuted millions of Christians responsible for a hundred million deaths and they've got a statue up to this guy in the middle of their city.
[02:19:02.711 --> 02:19:13.372]  Well the Seattle Mayor, I actually held their feet to the fire and I used their own rules against him because going out there with the megaphone peacefully and peacefully calling for it to be taken down.
[02:19:13.372 --> 02:19:16.573]  The Seattle Mayor the next day said he agreed that it should be taken down.
[02:19:18.311 --> 02:19:25.413]  I get your point, fighting fire with fire, but in a way these evil guy statues are monuments to what they did.
[02:19:25.413 --> 02:19:26.913]  We should be aware of them.
[02:19:26.913 --> 02:19:32.494]  And aren't we kind of fitting in to the virtue signaling when we start getting into this game of pulling stuff down?
[02:19:32.494 --> 02:19:33.594]  I mean, I'm not saying you're bad.
[02:19:33.594 --> 02:19:34.414]  I get why you did it.
[02:19:34.414 --> 02:19:36.355]  But when we come back, explain that to me.
[02:19:36.355 --> 02:19:41.016]  And then coming up, we've got a compilation video when goblins attack.
[02:19:42.034 --> 02:19:43.096]  But I mean, I shouldn't joke around.
[02:19:43.096 --> 02:19:44.718]  I had a guy try to hit me with his car last night.
[02:19:44.718 --> 02:19:46.620]  I mean, these people are crazy.
[02:19:46.620 --> 02:19:47.761]  And I thought, did he just try to hit me?
[02:19:47.761 --> 02:19:48.843]  Pulled up, started going, F you.
[02:19:48.843 --> 02:19:50.905]  I was like, dude, this is the real world.
[02:19:50.905 --> 02:19:51.847]  Why don't you get out of that car?
[02:19:54.005 --> 02:19:55.966]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:19:55.966 --> 02:20:01.269]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:20:01.269 --> 02:20:02.850]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:20:02.850 --> 02:20:11.215]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:20:11.215 --> 02:20:16.899]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:20:17.079 --> 02:20:18.901]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:20:18.901 --> 02:20:21.164]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:20:21.164 --> 02:20:25.570]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:20:25.570 --> 02:20:27.753]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[02:21:52.643 --> 02:21:57.107]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[02:21:57.107 --> 02:21:58.709]  Those times may be near.
[02:21:58.709 --> 02:21:59.610]  Think about it.
[02:21:59.610 --> 02:22:04.214]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[02:22:04.214 --> 02:22:08.859]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[02:22:09.199 --> 02:22:15.008]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[02:22:15.008 --> 02:22:21.718]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[02:22:21.718 --> 02:22:24.282]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[02:22:24.702 --> 02:22:27.523]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[02:23:05.396 --> 02:23:06.956]  NASA PAC Technology.

[02:23:11.737 --> 02:23:13.178]  Or warm and served.

[02:24:01.980 --> 02:24:14.149]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:24:14.149 --> 02:24:14.809]  to 3 p.m.
[02:24:14.809 --> 02:24:15.510]  I'm here live.
[02:24:15.510 --> 02:24:19.413]  Now we've watched The Real News with David Knight from 8 a.m.
[02:24:19.413 --> 02:24:21.194]  till my broadcast kicks off.
[02:24:21.194 --> 02:24:23.196]  A lot of stations are looking to pick that up.
[02:24:23.196 --> 02:24:24.897]  Very, very thankful to all those affiliates.
[02:24:24.897 --> 02:24:28.320]  And we're getting up all the affiliate pages in the podcast and all that's going up.
[02:24:29.232 --> 02:24:33.655]  Today at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:24:33.655 --> 02:24:39.979]  Jack Posobiec, again Patriot, ran one of the biggest organizations during the campaign.
[02:24:39.979 --> 02:24:46.464]  CitizensForTrump.com and Trump and his sons routinely tweet out his information.
[02:24:46.464 --> 02:24:47.825]  Here's one of the tweets last week.
[02:24:48.837 --> 02:24:49.978]  That got the eye of the media.
[02:24:49.978 --> 02:24:56.226]  And again, they have to make normal behavior look upside down, like mothers and fathers ban that on entrance forms.
[02:24:56.226 --> 02:24:57.127]  That's hurtful.
[02:24:57.127 --> 02:25:01.032]  Or free market, low taxes, what next?
[02:25:01.032 --> 02:25:03.134]  Then salon is promoting pedophilia.
[02:25:04.013 --> 02:25:09.895]  So, meanwhile, 39 shootings in Chicago this weekend, 9 deaths, no national media outrage.
[02:25:09.895 --> 02:25:10.556]  Why is that?
[02:25:10.556 --> 02:25:18.959]  Well, just like we saw now 15 dead in Barcelona, hundreds injured, 7 stabbed in Russia, dozens more.
[02:25:18.959 --> 02:25:21.900]  So many stabbings last week by people yelling Allah Akbar.
[02:25:21.900 --> 02:25:26.542]  Jack, I couldn't even keep track of it, but then we had national headlines, CNN, tonight.
[02:25:28.123 --> 02:25:29.365]  Naval intelligence?
[02:25:29.365 --> 02:25:31.487]  What's it doing?
[02:25:31.487 --> 02:25:34.370]  This Jack Posobiec needs to be shut down?
[02:25:34.370 --> 02:25:36.452]  The President tweets him!
[02:25:36.452 --> 02:25:40.116]  He can't have a security clearance if the President likes him!
[02:25:40.116 --> 02:25:41.998]  That's upside down world!
[02:25:43.440 --> 02:25:45.743]  But again, their projector is right-wing.
[02:25:45.743 --> 02:25:49.588]  Jack Posobiec, retweeted by Trump, is a Navy intel officer.
[02:25:49.588 --> 02:25:51.511]  Dun, dun, dun.
[02:25:51.511 --> 02:25:54.374]  You can't trust those Navy intel officers.
[02:25:54.374 --> 02:25:57.719]  But let's have all the radical jihadis run checkpoints at the border.
[02:25:57.719 --> 02:25:58.460]  Sorry, Jack, go ahead.
[02:25:59.833 --> 02:26:08.177]  Yeah, I know Alex, so I don't know why they felt like it was such an important thing to go ahead and burn my cover like that or go ahead and put that all out there for all to see.
[02:26:08.177 --> 02:26:11.719]  But again, I've never posted anything with classified information.
[02:26:11.719 --> 02:26:14.340]  I've never put anything out about classified information.
[02:26:14.340 --> 02:26:23.605]  In fact, I can actually tell you that Deep State went and pulled my security clearance months and months ago, well before when I came out specifically as a Trump supporter.
[02:26:24.205 --> 02:26:26.007]  This is something I did on the reserve time.
[02:26:26.007 --> 02:26:27.208]  I do my weekends.
[02:26:27.208 --> 02:26:29.211]  I've been deployed in the past.
[02:26:29.211 --> 02:26:30.892]  I'm not doing this on a day-to-day basis.
[02:26:30.892 --> 02:26:32.694]  On a day-to-day basis, I'm out there.
[02:26:32.694 --> 02:26:33.615]  You guys see what I'm doing.
[02:26:33.615 --> 02:26:35.778]  But it shows how they try to warp everything.
[02:26:37.114 --> 02:26:38.815]  They tweet everything around.
[02:26:38.815 --> 02:26:46.157]  They don't say, hey, here's a guy who served his country admirably, who's been awarded by the US military, and he's been retweeted by the president.
[02:26:46.157 --> 02:26:48.878]  They say, oh no, this guy's got to be shut down.
[02:26:48.878 --> 02:26:50.258]  We can't talk to this guy.
[02:26:50.258 --> 02:26:51.058]  Don't listen to him.
[02:26:51.058 --> 02:26:52.839]  I said, hey, what about all these awards?
[02:26:52.839 --> 02:26:54.199]  What about all these deployments I've done?
[02:26:54.199 --> 02:26:55.079]  No, no, no.
[02:26:55.079 --> 02:26:56.880]  You're someone who we can't be listened to.
[02:26:56.880 --> 02:27:06.443]  So they try to discredit, and they try to peel back anything that you're saying, rather than talk about the actual content of what I tweeted, and the fact that the president retweeted it.
[02:27:07.163 --> 02:27:09.085]  The 39 shootings in Chicago.
[02:27:09.085 --> 02:27:11.107]  We had 63 this past weekend.
[02:27:11.107 --> 02:27:13.269]  They're still not talking about it, Alex.
[02:27:13.269 --> 02:27:15.110]  And that's how they changed the subject.
[02:27:15.110 --> 02:27:19.734]  We got a guy with no criminal record, intel officer, before and now reserve.
[02:27:19.734 --> 02:27:21.436]  We need to have his thing pulled.
[02:27:21.436 --> 02:27:23.117]  Because they knew it was already pulled.
[02:27:23.117 --> 02:27:28.122]  They didn't want to announce later it got pulled to make it look like you can't be in government if you support the president.
[02:27:29.730 --> 02:27:30.151]  Right.
[02:27:30.151 --> 02:27:32.354]  It's this entire narrative that they're trying to pull.
[02:27:32.354 --> 02:27:35.738]  They want to keep the silent majority silent.
[02:27:35.738 --> 02:27:44.770]  Alex, there are Trump supporters within the military, within the intel community, within all branches of our companies, and all branches of our society, but you're told to be quiet.
[02:27:44.770 --> 02:27:45.631]  It's gaslighting.
[02:27:46.031 --> 02:27:58.219]  It is the idea that if you speak out in support of president, if you speak out outside the narrative, if you talk about the African Americans that are being shot in our inner cities on a weekly basis, you are shut down.
[02:27:58.219 --> 02:27:59.940]  We have to, can't talk about that.
[02:27:59.940 --> 02:28:00.780]  Don't look at this guy.
[02:28:00.780 --> 02:28:02.361]  Look at the shiny object over here.
[02:28:02.361 --> 02:28:10.506]  We're told that the small group of, you know, these 500 scumbag racist in Charlottesville is somehow representative of a strong movement in America.
[02:28:10.506 --> 02:28:12.407]  Uh, spoiler alert, it's not.
[02:28:12.407 --> 02:28:13.848]  And they're going to, they said, look at this, look at
[02:28:13.928 --> 02:28:17.630]  Well, notice, they won't even say all these Islamic attacks of last week.
[02:28:17.630 --> 02:28:20.731]  Injuring hundreds, killing over, you know, 15 or whatever.
[02:28:20.731 --> 02:28:34.277]  They're not even saying that's Islamic, but then they're saying all conservatives are to blame for one loon ball, who it turns out is a Democrat, and every other leader of it were recently high-level Democrat operatives.
[02:28:34.277 --> 02:28:37.539]  I mean, Jack, you don't need to be a naval intel officer to see what's going on here.
[02:28:38.638 --> 02:28:40.700]  No, they invited me to speak at that rally.
[02:28:40.700 --> 02:28:43.222]  This group has been trying to get in touch with us for a while.
[02:28:43.222 --> 02:28:45.864]  When we were doing the Deplora Ball, they were trying to come out to that.
[02:28:45.864 --> 02:28:46.624]  We shut them down.
[02:28:46.624 --> 02:28:48.866]  We said, no, we don't want anything to do with you guys.
[02:28:48.866 --> 02:28:50.127]  We can see what you are.
[02:28:50.127 --> 02:28:52.009]  You guys need to be kicked out.
[02:28:52.009 --> 02:28:55.251]  We don't want anything to do with you in our movement.
[02:28:55.251 --> 02:28:58.254]  Zero racism, zero violence.
[02:28:58.254 --> 02:29:05.660]  We are all about prosperity and Americana and coming together and loving each other.
[02:29:05.660 --> 02:29:08.102]  The only colors that I'm looking at are red, white, and blue, Alex.
[02:29:09.653 --> 02:29:14.996]  Let me ask you this, we're going to go to break, come back and play this compilation, but I'm going to get back into the whole statue.
[02:29:14.996 --> 02:29:23.560]  I get it's a giant Lenin statue, he launched an operation that killed 200 plus million people, he personally presided over 20 million dead, millions of Ukrainians, you name it.
[02:29:23.560 --> 02:29:26.782]  A total pig-like goblin.
[02:29:26.782 --> 02:29:30.784]  Why are they putting that in the city and worshipping it when they want to bring down Robert E. Lee?
[02:29:31.744 --> 02:29:37.326]  Who had nothing to do with slavery, and who was the head of the Northern Army before, of Northern Virginia.
[02:29:37.326 --> 02:29:42.708]  I mean, he was going to be neutral until they started burning farms around him, and he said, that's it!
[02:29:42.708 --> 02:29:44.108]  We're on the march.
[02:29:44.108 --> 02:29:46.629]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:46.629 --> 02:29:49.330]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:55.140 --> 02:29:59.844]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[02:30:54.409 --> 02:31:03.499]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best-tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:31:03.499 --> 02:31:11.908]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:31:11.908 --> 02:31:16.573]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:31:16.773 --> 02:31:23.558]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:23.558 --> 02:31:30.722]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:31:30.722 --> 02:31:37.767]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:31:37.767 --> 02:31:42.090]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:31:42.230 --> 02:31:45.616]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:31:45.616 --> 02:31:47.519]  You will be supporting a free press.
[02:31:47.519 --> 02:31:51.947]  All the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:31:51.947 --> 02:31:53.610]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[02:31:55.985 --> 02:31:59.748]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:31:59.748 --> 02:32:07.493]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:32:07.493 --> 02:32:16.099]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:32:16.099 --> 02:32:20.522]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:32:20.522 --> 02:32:25.725]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our volcanoes.
[02:32:26.105 --> 02:32:30.348]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:32:30.348 --> 02:32:33.770]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[02:32:33.770 --> 02:32:44.896]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[02:32:44.896 --> 02:32:47.797]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[02:32:47.797 --> 02:32:53.781]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[02:32:57.038 --> 02:33:10.001]  Look, I know the supernatural is something that isn't supposed to happen, but it does happen.
[02:33:10.001 --> 02:33:22.325]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:27.864 --> 02:33:33.198]  All right, the toll free number to join us on air to talk about any of these big issues you've been raising.
[02:33:33.198 --> 02:33:35.965]  The total eclipse being deemed racist by the Atlantic Monthly.
[02:33:35.965 --> 02:33:36.687]  They're not joking.
[02:33:38.157 --> 02:33:39.158]  You say, well, that doesn't make sense.
[02:33:39.158 --> 02:33:39.858]  It discredits them.
[02:33:39.858 --> 02:33:41.159]  They want to sound outrageous.
[02:33:41.159 --> 02:33:52.847]  They want to set the precedent for the Overton window to say things so incredibly radical, you then accept other things that before would have sounded radical, but they've so skewed your brain, you don't see it.
[02:33:52.847 --> 02:33:57.690]  Also, IT staffers may have compromised sensitive data to foreign intelligence.
[02:33:57.690 --> 02:33:58.291]  They have been.
[02:33:59.446 --> 02:34:01.607]  Indicted for conspiracy against the U.S.
[02:34:01.607 --> 02:34:04.509]  We're going to talk to Jack Posobiec about his contacts in D.C.
[02:34:04.509 --> 02:34:06.390]  and what the intel is on that.
[02:34:06.390 --> 02:34:17.097]  But the reason they hate Jack Posobiec and the reason they hate Mike Cernovich and others is they work real sources and do real journalism in the defense of this republic.
[02:34:17.097 --> 02:34:18.958]  And that's why they want them shut down and shut up.
[02:34:18.958 --> 02:34:20.819]  That's why we're honored to have them here.
[02:34:20.819 --> 02:34:22.860]  Jack Posobiec, citizensoftrump.com.
[02:34:22.860 --> 02:34:23.961]  Jack Posobiec on Twitter.
[02:34:23.961 --> 02:34:25.302]  Be sure and follow him there.
[02:34:25.302 --> 02:34:26.803]  Before we go back to him,
[02:34:27.847 --> 02:34:28.768]  Here's the number.
[02:34:28.768 --> 02:34:29.188]  It's 800-259-9231.
[02:34:29.188 --> 02:34:33.731]  We'll launch that phone system.
[02:34:33.731 --> 02:34:36.593]  800-259-9231.
[02:34:36.593 --> 02:34:38.454]  Your questions, your comments for Jack Pasovic.
[02:34:38.454 --> 02:34:48.020]  David Knight already hosted the first three hours today of the new show he's launched here on the system, the InfoWars Network, I guess you could call it, Radio TV.
[02:34:48.020 --> 02:34:54.905]  We're going to be launching more broadcasts here in the next two weeks with Mike Cernovich, Roger Stone, and others.
[02:34:56.459 --> 02:34:57.540]  And we're going to add even more shows.
[02:34:57.540 --> 02:34:59.822]  We're very, very excited about your support.
[02:34:59.822 --> 02:35:20.220]  We're able to do this because you've been supporting us and I hope that listeners and viewers will remember that when you make a commitment to visit InfoWarsTore.com and get great organic coffee or get great water filtration systems or air filtration systems or Molon Labe shirts or Conservatism is the New Counterculture shirts.
[02:35:22.469 --> 02:35:47.205]  All of your purchases of the Emmerich's Essentials toiletries, organic mouthwash, shampoo, body wash, sunscreen, bug spray, all of it, CNN's terrorist organization shirts, Donald Trump, President 2020, CNN is fake news, Infowars.com is real news, it's all there, but the BuzzFeed special, that's combining last month's special and the 1776 special, that's gotta end.
[02:35:47.205 --> 02:35:48.726]  I said I'd run through the month, but
[02:35:49.887 --> 02:35:51.448]  We're running out of most of the things.
[02:35:51.448 --> 02:35:58.455]  We just ran out of MycoZX, which targets the fungus in the gut, not just the bad bacteria.
[02:35:58.455 --> 02:35:59.456]  That's sold out.
[02:35:59.456 --> 02:36:01.798]  Brain Force Plus is selling out, 55% off.
[02:36:01.798 --> 02:36:02.219]  Why wouldn't it?
[02:36:02.219 --> 02:36:03.420]  A great nootropic.
[02:36:03.420 --> 02:36:04.141]  DNA Force.
[02:36:04.141 --> 02:36:07.004]  Leading competitors are like 50 bucks, folks, so normally at 30 it's a good deal.
[02:36:07.004 --> 02:36:08.445]  1776, 55% off, you can't beat it.
[02:36:08.445 --> 02:36:08.785]  Brain Force.
[02:36:11.604 --> 02:36:14.507]  DNA Force is selling out, but I've still got a 20% off.
[02:36:14.507 --> 02:36:17.390]  Silver Bullet, Colloidal Silver, selling out, 66% off.
[02:36:17.390 --> 02:36:20.953]  Knockout, the SleepAge, selling out, 50% off.
[02:36:20.953 --> 02:36:27.459]  Survival Shield X2, the good halogen that blocks the other bad halogens, not just radioactive iodine, it is 55% off.
[02:36:27.459 --> 02:36:29.261]  Secret 12, 55% off.
[02:36:29.261 --> 02:36:30.823]  BioTrue Selenium, 29% off.
[02:36:30.823 --> 02:36:36.028]  Remember, BuzzFeed got these, did over $10,000 in testing at a top California lab.
[02:36:38.134 --> 02:36:39.596]  Who also sells products.
[02:36:39.596 --> 02:36:42.359]  So they go do testing and tell you what the top products are.
[02:36:42.359 --> 02:36:43.880]  Said, okay, this stuff's totally clean.
[02:36:43.880 --> 02:36:45.622]  Didn't tell you what a feat that is.
[02:36:45.622 --> 02:36:47.444]  The California standards.
[02:36:47.444 --> 02:36:50.147]  And then they went, oh, look at this B12.
[02:36:50.147 --> 02:36:51.048]  It's 40 bucks.
[02:36:51.048 --> 02:36:51.809]  No, it's normally $25.
[02:36:51.809 --> 02:36:54.011]  But, okay, they lied about that.
[02:36:54.011 --> 02:36:56.434]  They go, but here's the brand that we sell.
[02:36:56.434 --> 02:36:57.875]  It's the best tested.
[02:36:57.875 --> 02:36:59.137]  And it's who we private label.
[02:36:59.137 --> 02:37:00.198]  They're so stupid.
[02:37:01.826 --> 02:37:04.608]  They're selling it for $35, we're selling it for $17.76.
[02:37:04.608 --> 02:37:07.151]  That's selling out.
[02:37:07.151 --> 02:37:09.373]  Caveman is now in strawberry flavor as well.
[02:37:09.373 --> 02:37:11.394]  Concentrated bone broth.
[02:37:11.394 --> 02:37:15.418]  The essence is so filling, so good for your bones, your joints, everything.
[02:37:15.418 --> 02:37:20.322]  The ancients knew that with the bee pollen, the chaga mushroom, the turmeric, and so much more.
[02:37:20.322 --> 02:37:20.823]  Amazing.
[02:37:20.823 --> 02:37:21.724]  That's back in stock.
[02:37:22.324 --> 02:37:26.546]  Alexa Pure Pro blows away all the other gravity-fed filters out there you hear advertised.
[02:37:26.546 --> 02:37:27.526]  It's just amazing.
[02:37:27.526 --> 02:37:28.647]  Pro Pure's great as well.
[02:37:28.647 --> 02:37:31.888]  I carry all the best brands at the lowest prices.
[02:37:31.888 --> 02:37:31.908]  $147.
[02:37:31.908 --> 02:37:35.189]  Leading competitors are like $300 for stuff that doesn't work as well.
[02:37:35.189 --> 02:37:37.210]  Alexa Pure Breeze, that special's gotta end today.
[02:37:37.210 --> 02:37:41.132]  25% off on the house four-stage filter.

[02:38:35.437 --> 02:38:41.002]  So Jack Posobiec, I want to play a clip and go to calls and have you ride shotgun with us, but I've been asking the questions here.
[02:38:41.002 --> 02:38:42.263]  You've always got a lot of intel.
[02:38:42.263 --> 02:38:42.823]  Bannon out.
[02:38:43.829 --> 02:38:47.631]  Shake-ups, increasing troops in Afghanistan.
[02:38:47.631 --> 02:38:52.353]  I know as somebody in the military, you're not supposed to comment on the President's policy specifically on that.
[02:38:52.353 --> 02:38:58.576]  One reason you've never gotten into the fact you were in Naval Intelligence, but they're trying to run you out of that now.
[02:38:58.576 --> 02:39:04.118]  But obviously, I don't want to say the President's going sideways, but I don't think a lot of this is a good sign overall.
[02:39:04.118 --> 02:39:09.921]  I know that Bannon kind of stood by when the generals took over, when McMaster came in.
[02:39:09.921 --> 02:39:12.202]  So there's kind of this argument, well, you got eaten last.
[02:39:12.662 --> 02:39:16.145]  But at the same time, I see Breitbart doing such great work.
[02:39:16.145 --> 02:39:20.309]  What do the tea leaves say to you about all this?
[02:39:20.309 --> 02:39:29.798]  Alex, it reminds me of a situation where you had one person in there, like we had at different points of the campaign, that was closer to sort of more of an ear of the people.
[02:39:29.798 --> 02:39:31.819]  And that's what Bannon sort of represented.
[02:39:31.819 --> 02:39:35.623]  He wasn't somebody who was necessarily setting every single policy.
[02:39:35.623 --> 02:39:37.064]  It wasn't just coming from Bannon.
[02:39:37.064 --> 02:39:37.825]  People understood that.
[02:39:39.406 --> 02:39:39.887]  We're good to go.
[02:39:57.694 --> 02:40:00.435]  They called it the Eric Prince plan, but it actually wasn't that.
[02:40:00.435 --> 02:40:04.236]  It was the plan that was used immediately after 9-11 in Afghanistan.
[02:40:04.236 --> 02:40:08.437]  I actually spoke to Eric Prince on the phone last Friday morning, prior to.
[02:40:08.437 --> 02:40:10.978]  He was barred from going to Camp David.
[02:40:10.978 --> 02:40:15.480]  He was barred from going to present his plan, which was just a reminder of what the U.S.
[02:40:15.480 --> 02:40:16.760]  did immediately after 9-11.
[02:40:16.760 --> 02:40:20.941]  It was only when in, we found locals that could be worked with.
[02:40:20.941 --> 02:40:26.103]  People who weren't Taliban, people who weren't these extremists, people who knew the culture, people who spoke the language.
[02:40:26.363 --> 02:40:29.484]  People who wouldn't be seen as an occupying force.
[02:40:29.484 --> 02:40:33.565]  And we worked with them to achieve our goals and to achieve stability.
[02:40:33.565 --> 02:40:35.685]  Look, we don't want to take over Afghanistan.
[02:40:35.685 --> 02:40:39.046]  We're not in the business in the United States of running other countries.
[02:40:39.046 --> 02:40:41.646]  We just don't want the Taliban or ISIS.
[02:40:41.646 --> 02:40:48.328]  So you're talking about a stabilization force so there's not another failed state for ISIS or Al Qaeda to reconstitute?
[02:40:48.328 --> 02:40:49.108]  Exactly.
[02:40:49.108 --> 02:40:51.908]  One that's set up and run by the Afghans.
[02:40:51.908 --> 02:40:55.429]  And have those people, so have Americans only there in more of an
[02:40:55.976 --> 02:40:57.277]  And that is what the Afghans want.
[02:40:57.277 --> 02:40:57.718]  They want us out.
[02:40:57.718 --> 02:41:00.620]  So if we... So what do you make of this speech of the President coming up tonight?
[02:41:00.620 --> 02:41:01.261]  We'll be covering live.
[02:41:20.117 --> 02:41:20.737]  Yeah, well we'll see.
[02:41:20.737 --> 02:41:22.018]  I mean, it remains to be seen.
[02:41:22.018 --> 02:41:26.781]  There hasn't been any official leaks or any official response about what the speech is going to be.
[02:41:26.781 --> 02:41:35.105]  But the big problem, and Alexander the Great learned this going back 2,000 years ago, is that when you march into Afghanistan and look like an occupying force,
[02:41:35.889 --> 02:41:37.469]  This is fourth generation warfare, Alex.
[02:41:37.469 --> 02:41:38.490]  You know this stuff.
[02:41:38.490 --> 02:41:45.891]  It makes you look like the overpowering aggressor and it's going to make people want to rise up against that force.
[02:41:45.891 --> 02:41:56.673]  We've got to find a way to make it look like it's Afghanistan getting our help to push out the extremists, not another invasion of the country, not an occupying force.
[02:41:56.673 --> 02:41:58.234]  That's the message that we need to send.
[02:41:58.234 --> 02:41:59.294]  We have to be very careful.
[02:41:59.714 --> 02:42:07.078]  About any sort of surge, any massive, you know, whether or not tanks and armor are going to be going in, what type of uniforms people are going to be wearing.
[02:42:07.078 --> 02:42:10.320]  In fact, Erik Prince in his plan, he said, we weren't even going to wear US uniforms.
[02:42:10.816 --> 02:42:17.601]  We were going to have people wear sort of this joint uniform that didn't specify it to make us look like these occupying forces.
[02:42:17.601 --> 02:42:18.362]  Let's talk about that.
[02:42:18.362 --> 02:42:19.062]  That's a big deal.
[02:42:19.062 --> 02:42:24.526]  Talking to Eric Prince, founder of Blackwater, and then XT and the rest of it really got demonized by the left.
[02:42:24.526 --> 02:42:29.470]  But it turns out that behind the scenes, he's exposed the pedophile rings, helped expose Hillary.
[02:42:29.470 --> 02:42:30.310]  They really hate him.
[02:42:30.310 --> 02:42:33.172]  They've been wanting to try to, you know, set him up for a long time.
[02:42:33.172 --> 02:42:34.473]  You say you talked to him.
[02:42:34.473 --> 02:42:36.435]  What can you relay about that conversation?
[02:42:37.912 --> 02:42:43.359]  Well, what I can relay is that he's essentially been sidelined at this point by the National Security Council.
[02:42:43.359 --> 02:42:50.329]  At one point, his plan, there are people saying that actually Kelly was considering his plan, was looking at it and saying, you know what, this makes sense.
[02:42:50.856 --> 02:42:52.657]  Alex, at this point, no one will talk about the numbers.
[02:42:52.657 --> 02:42:57.741]  We already have about 8,000 troops and over 10,000 more contractors in Afghanistan.
[02:42:57.741 --> 02:43:01.643]  Sure, so let's talk about Eric Prince's plan, because nobody was hearing this stuff.
[02:43:01.643 --> 02:43:02.544]  This is interesting.
[02:43:02.544 --> 02:43:03.084]  Sure.
[02:43:03.084 --> 02:43:11.870]  So his plan was to reduce that number down to make us, instead of looking like an occupying force, we were going to send contractors in, people that had the mandate of the U.S.
[02:43:11.870 --> 02:43:13.391]  government, they'd be working for the U.S.
[02:43:13.391 --> 02:43:18.395]  government, but with Afghanistan Special Forces, with Afghanistan Army, to work
[02:43:18.695 --> 02:43:19.356]  We're good to go.
[02:43:36.573 --> 02:43:37.313]  That if the U.S.
[02:43:37.313 --> 02:43:45.239]  goes and sends another 5,000, 6,000 troops to Afghanistan, it's going to look like a massive invasion, and Afghanistan remembers what happened in 2003.
[02:43:45.239 --> 02:43:51.823]  And we heard months ago that Trump, and he signaled, he was looking at reduction and going with that plan.
[02:43:51.823 --> 02:43:56.086]  The word we've gotten is he's going to announce expansion tonight.
[02:43:56.086 --> 02:44:01.089]  Yeah, all signs indicate that the President, because they removed any third option.
[02:44:01.089 --> 02:44:02.030]  This was the third option.
[02:44:02.506 --> 02:44:09.751]  The only two options presented to the President at Camp David on Friday were the surge or a complete withdrawal.
[02:44:09.751 --> 02:44:16.236]  So if those are the only two options, of course he's going to choose the one that doesn't completely follow what Obama did in Iraq.
[02:44:16.236 --> 02:44:17.918]  Because the President... Well, here's the deal.
[02:44:17.918 --> 02:44:19.619]  If we're going to leave, we shouldn't announce it.
[02:44:19.619 --> 02:44:23.502]  We should just do it, or it'll be like 1975, people hanging off helicopters, kids.
[02:44:25.006 --> 02:44:25.446]  Exactly.
[02:44:25.446 --> 02:44:26.327]  So we can't have that.
[02:44:26.327 --> 02:44:27.327]  That's what happened in Vietnam.
[02:44:27.327 --> 02:44:31.528]  That's what happened in Iraq after the complete pullout during Obama.
[02:44:31.528 --> 02:44:43.313]  But what wasn't at the table was this third option of a reduction of, instead of having a massive force, have a smaller, smarter force that goes in with the mandate of using Afghan troops.
[02:44:43.313 --> 02:44:45.293]  Sure, but instead they're going with a build-down.
[02:44:48.789 --> 02:44:55.712]  Yeah, so what they're going to say is there's going to be a surge up front and then eventually it's going to slowly, slowly, slowly go down.
[02:44:55.712 --> 02:44:58.093]  So it'll be big up front and then come back at the end.
[02:44:58.093 --> 02:44:59.274]  It's almost like accounting, right?
[02:44:59.274 --> 02:45:04.176]  But the problem is that's the same thing that's been going on for the last 16 years.
[02:45:04.176 --> 02:45:05.897]  It's the same line they always use.
[02:45:05.897 --> 02:45:06.677]  It's the same minute.
[02:45:06.677 --> 02:45:08.958]  That line, oh, you know, it's not a 16-year war.
[02:45:08.958 --> 02:45:13.580]  Yeah, they've been front-loading this from the beginning and it's pure crap.
[02:45:15.441 --> 02:45:18.925]  Sure, and there's going to be parts of Afghanistan that the U.S.
[02:45:18.925 --> 02:45:26.432]  unfortunately remained in for a long time because a lot of people in the Beltway are talking about it like Germany or Japan or South Korea where the U.S.
[02:45:26.432 --> 02:45:29.896]  essentially has permanent forces now and permanent bases.
[02:45:29.896 --> 02:45:32.779]  They're talking about permanent bases in Afghanistan.
[02:45:32.779 --> 02:45:34.461]  That's the long-term plan here, Alex.
[02:45:35.689 --> 02:45:39.872]  Alright, I want to go to break in a few minutes and come back and talk to Alex, Josh, Dan, Kevin, and Jacob and others.
[02:45:39.872 --> 02:45:44.355]  Jack Posobiec, really smart guy, journalist, is our guest.
[02:45:44.355 --> 02:45:52.160]  An evil person, though, that points out that there's Islamic attacks, the media doesn't cover it, but there's mass shootings in Chicago, they don't cover it, because it's Democrat-controlled stuff.
[02:45:52.160 --> 02:45:58.905]  But there's one person dies at a tragic, you know, funded, globalist, manipulated event in Charlottesville.
[02:45:58.905 --> 02:46:02.207]  Every one of us is supposedly guilty for it.
[02:46:02.207 --> 02:46:03.628]  So simply, simply incredible.
[02:46:03.628 --> 02:46:05.349]  But here's this compilation I mentioned.
[02:46:06.810 --> 02:46:16.994]  Uh, all bleeped out of some of the Democrats in Seattle throwing things at me, getting in my face, unable to speak, unable ever to defend their ideas, and usually running away once they made the point.
[02:46:16.994 --> 02:46:19.435]  Here it is.
[02:46:19.435 --> 02:46:21.136]  You're not welcome with your racist ideas.
[02:46:21.136 --> 02:46:22.677]  That's right.
[02:46:22.677 --> 02:46:23.357]  Elitist.
[02:46:23.357 --> 02:46:26.279]  I think I'm not a good building officer.
[02:46:28.349 --> 02:46:29.470]  This is America, bro.
[02:46:29.470 --> 02:46:31.892]  InfoWars hates you, though, because you're an a**hole.
[02:46:31.892 --> 02:46:32.753]  Uh-huh.
[02:46:32.753 --> 02:46:34.754]  And I can't be intimidated by the group thing?
[02:46:34.754 --> 02:46:36.115]  Are you that crazy guy from InfoWars?
[02:46:36.115 --> 02:46:36.255]  Yeah.
[02:46:36.255 --> 02:46:36.796]  How's it going?
[02:46:36.796 --> 02:46:38.357]  What are you doing here?
[02:46:38.357 --> 02:46:39.578]  Oh, it's America.
[02:46:39.578 --> 02:46:41.199]  I've been here many times.
[02:46:41.199 --> 02:46:42.520]  No, I mean Seattle.
[02:46:42.520 --> 02:46:44.421]  You just said America?
[02:46:44.421 --> 02:46:45.002]  Seattle.
[02:46:46.349 --> 02:46:49.111]  Hey, brother, hey, you want to talk to us?
[02:46:49.111 --> 02:46:51.653]  All you can do is that?
[02:46:51.653 --> 02:46:54.575]  Yeah, you know something?
[02:46:54.575 --> 02:46:55.856]  I'm not afraid of you people.
[02:46:55.856 --> 02:46:57.116]  You got something to say, say it.
[02:46:57.116 --> 02:46:58.557]  You got nothing intellectual.
[02:46:58.557 --> 02:47:01.339]  You're an intellectual dumb to watch the mainstream media.
[02:47:01.339 --> 02:47:02.880]  I mean, this is America.
[02:47:02.880 --> 02:47:04.061]  It's where you're standing now.
[02:47:04.061 --> 02:47:04.561]  No, no.
[02:47:04.561 --> 02:47:06.643]  It's part of America, but you're in Seattle right now.
[02:47:07.583 --> 02:47:08.544]  Why are you here?
[02:47:08.544 --> 02:47:10.385]  Because it's a free country.
[02:47:10.385 --> 02:47:11.946]  Yeah, that's why you're allowed to be here.
[02:47:11.946 --> 02:47:12.527]  Why are you here, though?
[02:47:12.527 --> 02:47:12.967]  What's your job?
[02:47:12.967 --> 02:47:20.012]  What's your... I'm just here showing this hardcore fascist brainwashing that the corporate media and the big banks have done on the people.
[02:47:20.012 --> 02:47:22.074]  How they can take people that think they're liberal and turn them into fascists.
[02:47:22.074 --> 02:47:23.135]  Good luck with that, buddy.
[02:47:23.135 --> 02:47:24.956]  Dylan, we're doing a live feed right now.
[02:47:24.956 --> 02:47:26.357]  Let me ask you a quick question.
[02:47:26.357 --> 02:47:31.301]  Did you see how newspapers everywhere said the economy is going to implode today and that it caused the stock market to implode?
[02:47:31.741 --> 02:47:34.884]  Well, I just wanted to stop and tell you that I think your story was terrible.
[02:47:34.884 --> 02:47:35.464]  Well, thank you.
[02:47:35.464 --> 02:47:36.184]  But keep talking to us.
[02:47:36.184 --> 02:47:37.185]  Keep talking.
[02:47:37.185 --> 02:47:38.006]  You came over.
[02:47:38.006 --> 02:47:39.487]  I have to go home.
[02:47:39.487 --> 02:47:40.588]  I saw you earlier today.
[02:47:40.588 --> 02:47:45.892]  So you'd actually like to see the economy implode rather just to hurt Trump?
[02:47:45.892 --> 02:47:48.594]  I think you are full of conspiracies.
[02:47:48.594 --> 02:47:51.096]  Okay, so they're actually trying to make the economy implode.
[02:47:51.096 --> 02:47:53.578]  They even announced that the head of his group resigned.
[02:47:54.819 --> 02:47:58.545]  I think your whole conspiracy is, and I don't think that you are helping our country.
[02:47:58.545 --> 02:48:01.048]  Did you know the media misrepresents what I actually say?
[02:48:01.048 --> 02:48:02.671]  Give me an example of one of my conspiracies.
[02:48:07.668 --> 02:48:10.669]  Now that is an edited thing for comedy shows they did.
[02:48:10.669 --> 02:48:15.630]  Have you heard about Atrazine causing about 60% of the amphibian life to be sterile?
[02:48:15.630 --> 02:48:17.211]  I think you are ridiculous.
[02:48:17.211 --> 02:48:22.432]  So I'm telling you, runoff in the water is hurting children and causing chemical changes in the brain.
[02:48:22.432 --> 02:48:24.813]  No, he's hurting children.
[02:48:24.813 --> 02:48:26.874]  You're not worried about chemical runoff in the water?
[02:48:26.874 --> 02:48:27.914]  I'm worried about Nazis.
[02:48:28.434 --> 02:48:29.254]  You're worried about Nazis.
[02:48:29.254 --> 02:48:31.115]  I'm worried about- This is perfect.
[02:48:31.115 --> 02:48:32.535]  I'm worried about Bannon.
[02:48:32.535 --> 02:48:33.695]  Okay, you're worried about Bannon?
[02:48:33.695 --> 02:48:36.776]  Yeah, I'm worried about- So you don't know about Akrajin?
[02:48:36.776 --> 02:48:38.857]  She just walked over.
[02:48:38.857 --> 02:48:40.777]  Sir- It doesn't matter your race.
[02:48:40.777 --> 02:48:42.538]  It doesn't matter where you come from.
[02:48:42.538 --> 02:48:46.559]  You should all have the right to live here and all the right to not.
[02:48:47.479 --> 02:48:50.961]  Have negative things happen to you, such as being murdered by a car.
[02:48:50.961 --> 02:48:55.164]  Well, but like the Muslims just ran over 13 people and killed over 100 in Barcelona.
[02:48:55.164 --> 02:48:56.245]  Fact check.
[02:48:56.245 --> 02:48:56.785]  Fact check!
[02:48:56.785 --> 02:48:57.866]  Oh, it didn't happen today.
[02:48:57.866 --> 02:48:59.006]  It didn't happen today.
[02:48:59.006 --> 02:49:00.487]  Right here on camera.
[02:49:00.487 --> 02:49:00.747]  Right here.
[02:49:00.747 --> 02:49:02.208]  Tell people intellectually who you are.
[02:49:02.208 --> 02:49:03.029]  Intellectually who I am?
[02:49:03.029 --> 02:49:03.289]  Go ahead.
[02:49:03.289 --> 02:49:03.829]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:49:03.829 --> 02:49:04.590]  I'm your mama.
[02:49:04.590 --> 02:49:05.310]  You can't even talk.
[02:49:05.310 --> 02:49:06.351]  Look at you.
[02:49:06.351 --> 02:49:08.912]  This is what they've turned the people into.
[02:49:08.912 --> 02:49:10.393]  This is it right here.
[02:49:10.393 --> 02:49:11.494]  Literal slave of the system.
[02:49:12.563 --> 02:49:13.423]  See that?
[02:49:13.423 --> 02:49:14.784]  That's who they are.
[02:49:14.784 --> 02:49:16.104]  Look at the sway.
[02:49:16.104 --> 02:49:17.645]  That was great.
[02:49:17.645 --> 02:49:18.105]  Go ahead.
[02:49:18.105 --> 02:49:20.506]  Go ahead.
[02:49:20.506 --> 02:49:21.426]  I know.
[02:49:21.426 --> 02:49:23.467]  This is the brainwasher.
[02:49:23.467 --> 02:49:25.607]  This is the brainwasher.
[02:49:25.607 --> 02:49:27.328]  You see?
[02:49:27.328 --> 02:49:29.269]  And I'm proud of this.
[02:49:29.269 --> 02:49:32.330]  Because this is who they are.
[02:49:32.330 --> 02:49:34.310]  That's why they're allied with jihadis.
[02:49:34.310 --> 02:49:36.431]  Because they hate the West so much.
[02:49:36.431 --> 02:49:39.052]  That's how he told me.
[02:49:39.052 --> 02:49:40.072]  I'm going to pour my hot coffee on you.
[02:49:40.072 --> 02:49:41.153]  And I said, go ahead.
[02:49:41.153 --> 02:49:41.773]  And quite frankly,
[02:49:43.382 --> 02:49:44.463]  It was just, it felt wonderful.
[02:49:44.463 --> 02:49:46.024]  It's like a hot bath.
[02:49:46.024 --> 02:49:48.146]  And that's what this is all about.
[02:49:48.146 --> 02:49:54.532]  It's just being baptized in the truth and seeing these guys be forced to awaken.
[02:49:54.532 --> 02:49:56.774]  So that's why we're out here.
[02:49:56.774 --> 02:50:01.278]  To show you the abject fear these people are in.
[02:50:03.109 --> 02:50:08.894]  And how scared they are of someone actually trying to return power back to the people and actually turning the economy on.
[02:50:08.894 --> 02:50:11.395]  They're so pissed about $4 trillion in the stock market.
[02:50:11.395 --> 02:50:16.720]  They're so pissed about $400 billion in new jobs, $1.5 million in new jobs.
[02:50:16.720 --> 02:50:19.462]  They're so pissed over 1,000 companies coming back.
[02:50:19.462 --> 02:50:24.626]  They're so pissed that their whole identity was in Hillary, this evil bubble.
[02:50:25.578 --> 02:50:29.121]  And that when she failed, they all felt existentially wounded.
[02:50:29.121 --> 02:50:38.127]  And so the demonization by the media begins, and then I deserve to be attacked by these fascists because they believe I'm a Nazi.
[02:50:38.127 --> 02:50:39.488]  And that was only a fraction of it.
[02:50:39.488 --> 02:50:44.272]  We're going to come back with Jack Posobiec straight ahead and talk to Alex, Josh, Dan, Kevin, Jason, and others.
[02:50:44.272 --> 02:50:48.055]  And then David Knight, who already hosted three hours this morning, he's hosting the fourth hour.
[02:50:48.055 --> 02:50:51.537]  But we got a lot of other special guest hosts coming up like Paul Watson tomorrow.
[02:50:51.537 --> 02:50:51.998]  We'll be back.
[02:50:53.703 --> 02:50:57.226]  Are you one of the 15 million men who suffer from an enlarged prostate?
[02:50:57.226 --> 02:51:05.412]  If your life revolves around finding the closest bathroom, if you're tired of waking up many times a night to urinate, then you need to know about Prostate Miracle.
[02:51:05.412 --> 02:51:10.416]  Prostate Miracle contains beta-cytosterone, which is 3,000 times stronger than salt by metal.

[02:51:32.832 --> 02:51:34.032]  That's a tall order.
[02:51:34.032 --> 02:51:38.535]  But you can get all of that with properly designed participating whole life insurance.
[02:51:38.775 --> 02:51:41.636]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[02:51:41.636 --> 02:51:42.457]  That's true.
[02:51:42.457 --> 02:51:46.958]  But you can have tax-free access to use your life insurance while you're alive.

[02:51:53.881 --> 02:51:56.242]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[02:51:56.242 --> 02:52:04.305]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[02:52:04.305 --> 02:52:06.086]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.

[02:52:23.154 --> 02:52:23.954]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:52:23.954 --> 02:52:25.755]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:52:25.755 --> 02:52:27.416]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:52:27.416 --> 02:52:30.237]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:52:30.237 --> 02:52:32.518]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:52:32.518 --> 02:52:37.040]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[02:52:37.040 --> 02:52:40.982]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[02:52:40.982 --> 02:52:44.744]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[02:52:44.744 --> 02:52:45.064]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[02:52:45.064 --> 02:52:46.805]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[02:52:52.591 --> 02:52:54.532]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:52:54.532 --> 02:52:59.854]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:52:59.854 --> 02:53:01.434]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:53:01.434 --> 02:53:09.798]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:53:09.798 --> 02:53:15.480]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:53:15.660 --> 02:53:17.482]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:53:17.482 --> 02:53:19.745]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:53:19.745 --> 02:53:24.151]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:53:24.151 --> 02:53:26.354]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:53:26.354 --> 02:53:34.204]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[02:54:01.912 --> 02:54:03.673]  Alright, we're taking your phone calls this segment to the next.
[02:54:03.673 --> 02:54:08.456]  I'll host a little bit in with David Knight coming up in the fourth hour.
[02:54:08.456 --> 02:54:16.240]  Wow, I haven't even gotten to the IT staffers and I'm not even covering the eclipse that's basically mostly across the United States right now.
[02:54:16.240 --> 02:54:19.882]  Hadn't happened since 1776.
[02:54:19.882 --> 02:54:21.603]  But the crew just found something really big.
[02:54:21.603 --> 02:54:24.005]  This is only a smattering of what you just saw last segment.
[02:54:25.245 --> 02:54:35.131]  Of people coming over and yelling and screaming and then running away and refusing to ever talk to me and refusing to defend their ideas.
[02:54:35.131 --> 02:54:43.256]  Esperanzo was this UN-created language of Chinese, Spanish, English and some other languages that would be run from the UN.
[02:54:43.256 --> 02:54:44.517]  It totally failed.
[02:54:44.517 --> 02:54:50.941]  But here's the little globalist, one of the guys that walked over, wearing an Esperanzo shirt, a second language for us all,
[02:54:51.914 --> 02:54:53.775]  A second language for everyone.
[02:54:53.775 --> 02:54:56.837]  A total failure of social engineers.
[02:54:56.837 --> 02:55:00.360]  And they're in their little enclaves like Seattle that they've hijacked.
[02:55:00.360 --> 02:55:04.162]  You know, kind of like a crab moving into somebody else's shell that they didn't build.
[02:55:04.162 --> 02:55:07.745]  And they're just, they're perching and their religion is hating America.
[02:55:07.745 --> 02:55:12.548]  We have the footage shot last night where people chant, death to America.
[02:55:12.548 --> 02:55:15.930]  Death to America at UT as they take down Robert E. Lee's statue.
[02:55:15.930 --> 02:55:17.791]  And forget Robert E. Lee.
[02:55:17.791 --> 02:55:19.252]  People don't even pay attention to those statues.
[02:55:19.252 --> 02:55:19.533]  It's that
[02:55:20.667 --> 02:55:22.128]  That's who these people are.
[02:55:22.128 --> 02:55:26.191]  That's on Infowars.com, but it's good.
[02:55:26.191 --> 02:55:32.855]  Ban and exit looks, I don't like that, but it's good to see these IT stabbers from Pakistan, clearly intelligence ops.
[02:55:32.855 --> 02:55:34.016]  We knew that from our sources.
[02:55:34.016 --> 02:55:36.138]  We covered this six months ago, so did you, Jack.
[02:55:36.138 --> 02:55:41.161]  Now penetrated, now arrested, now indicted basically for espionage.
[02:55:41.161 --> 02:55:44.423]  Boy, I tell you, Washerman and the Clintons, all them better watch their little booties now.
[02:55:47.557 --> 02:55:59.491]  It's interesting to see that these guys getting arrested, at the same time we're talking about Mueller pulling anyone in for this Russian investigation that he's completely gone on a witch hunt upon for anyone who's associated with the Trump campaign.
[02:55:59.491 --> 02:56:03.756]  Meanwhile, they've gotten completely away from the basic fact that we were supposed to be finding
[02:56:04.296 --> 02:56:08.099]  What was the source of the leaks of the DNC emails?
[02:56:08.099 --> 02:56:13.584]  Well, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, she was the chairwoman of the DNC, and these were her IT staffers.
[02:56:13.584 --> 02:56:19.409]  So we looked at it like regular journalists and said, hey, I wonder who was running the IT at the DNC?
[02:56:19.409 --> 02:56:20.410]  Who had access?
[02:56:20.410 --> 02:56:21.330]  Who were these people?
[02:56:21.330 --> 02:56:23.332]  And that's how we came upon these guys.
[02:56:23.332 --> 02:56:32.079]  And by the way, I know you don't ever want credit, but aren't you and Posobiec, I mean Posobiec and Cernovich, aren't you guys, who originated first looking into these guys?
[02:56:32.079 --> 02:56:32.680]  Wasn't it you guys?
[02:56:34.335 --> 02:56:37.617]  Uh, it was us, and then I think Daily Caller picked it up after that.
[02:56:37.617 --> 02:56:42.680]  I mean, to say that, you know, and now they're actually getting arrested, the main- arrested!
[02:56:42.680 --> 02:56:50.705]  They're actually charged by federal prosecutors, these four indictments coming down for Imran Awan, the mainstream media completely not touching it.
[02:56:50.705 --> 02:56:51.746]  This is actual news.
[02:56:51.746 --> 02:56:53.987]  This is not like something that I just tweeted out.
[02:56:53.987 --> 02:57:02.032]  This is- these guys are getting busted by the feds, and nobody wants to talk about it because it completely destroys the Russia narrative.
[02:57:02.032 --> 02:57:03.213]  And let's give a backdrop here.
[02:57:04.867 --> 02:57:09.929]  You've got 14 times Homeland Security, Jay Johnson trying to get the DNC computers.
[02:57:09.929 --> 02:57:11.829]  They won't let them in.
[02:57:11.829 --> 02:57:21.332]  Then you've got them blaming Trump for all this Russia stuff when they're the ones using the servers clearly instead of a drop box or going to a park and you know leaving something in the trash can for the Russian agents or whatever.
[02:57:21.332 --> 02:57:24.773]  They just do it in her server knowing everybody's got the codes.
[02:57:25.533 --> 02:57:27.735]  And then money's put in their foundation.
[02:57:27.735 --> 02:57:28.875]  It's so clear what they were doing.
[02:57:28.875 --> 02:57:35.820]  And then bringing in foreigners, who we know work for intelligence agencies, just come out to interface running the DNC.
[02:57:35.820 --> 02:57:39.002]  I mean, it shows total Muslim Brotherhood penetration.
[02:57:39.002 --> 02:57:42.004]  Something I was told by FBI agents like 15 years ago, and I didn't believe it.
[02:57:43.223 --> 02:57:47.466]  Yeah, Pakistani ISI is known for having a high level of technical expertise.
[02:57:47.466 --> 02:57:48.967]  That's their intelligence service.
[02:57:48.967 --> 02:57:55.131]  This is the same Pakistani ISI that set up Al-Qaeda, that was working with Osama Bin Laden in the early days.
[02:57:55.131 --> 02:57:58.213]  These guys, and at the same time, they also work closely with CIA.
[02:57:58.213 --> 02:58:02.536]  So there's a lot of connections here, but as usual, the mainstream media won't even touch it.
[02:58:02.536 --> 02:58:04.838]  These guys, they were potentially into everything.
[02:58:04.838 --> 02:58:08.320]  Wasserman Schultz, she had them, she had their family members on payroll.
[02:58:08.320 --> 02:58:10.302]  What they were getting paid for remains to be seen.
[02:58:10.982 --> 02:58:11.922]  Well, Jack, stay there.
[02:58:11.922 --> 02:58:13.023]  Back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:13.023 --> 02:58:14.183]  Alex, we're going right to you.
[02:58:14.183 --> 02:58:16.003]  Then Josh, Dan, Kevin, Jason.
[02:58:16.003 --> 02:58:17.344]  I'm going to be here until about 20 after.
[02:58:17.344 --> 02:58:21.565]  David Knight, let's bring him in here and get him seated right over there, my compadre.
[02:58:21.565 --> 02:58:24.585]  And a lot more is coming up as we take the InfoWar.
[02:58:24.585 --> 02:58:27.006]  Thanks to your support and prayers for the next level.
[02:58:27.006 --> 02:58:28.746]  Be sure and support our local affiliates.
[02:58:28.746 --> 02:58:29.666]  Spread the word.
[02:58:29.666 --> 02:58:31.947]  Make a donation to the local stations.
[02:58:31.947 --> 02:58:34.808]  We'll be back with our number four of syndication.
[02:58:34.808 --> 02:58:35.768]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:37.229 --> 02:58:39.431]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[02:58:44.305 --> 02:58:46.666]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:58:46.666 --> 02:58:47.967]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:58:47.967 --> 02:58:49.187]  Why is this so good?
[02:58:49.187 --> 02:58:54.470]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:58:54.470 --> 02:59:08.016]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:59:08.016 --> 02:59:09.377]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:59:10.137 --> 02:59:11.799]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:59:11.799 --> 02:59:14.381]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:59:14.381 --> 02:59:15.662]  These are all parasites.
[02:59:15.662 --> 02:59:16.763]  Tell us about all the stuff it says.
[02:59:16.763 --> 02:59:18.124]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:59:18.124 --> 02:59:22.628]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:59:22.628 --> 02:59:25.791]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:59:25.871 --> 02:59:28.953]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:59:28.953 --> 02:59:29.993]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:59:29.993 --> 02:59:31.934]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:31.934 --> 02:59:32.954]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:59:32.954 --> 02:59:35.636]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:59:35.636 --> 02:59:38.917]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:38.917 --> 02:59:41.178]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:59:41.178 --> 02:59:47.582]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:59:47.582 --> 02:59:50.203]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:07.686 --> 03:00:13.170]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:13.170 --> 03:00:17.894]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:25.984 --> 03:00:28.665]  And they shoved a big stack of papers in my hand and said, look at this.
[03:00:28.665 --> 03:00:31.105]  This isn't even getting hardly covered except for the new media.
[03:00:31.105 --> 03:00:35.466]  They've indicted the IT staffers for basically espionage, conspiracy against the U.S.
[03:00:35.466 --> 03:00:37.087]  So tonight's going to be covering that more.
[03:00:37.087 --> 03:00:38.367]  I should have made a bigger deal out of this.
[03:00:38.367 --> 03:00:42.428]  Or that Jack Posobiec and others were right at the very start, the ones looking at this.
[03:00:42.428 --> 03:00:43.188]  Oh, you're crazy.
[03:00:43.188 --> 03:00:47.009]  Oh, and then we saw Washburn Schultz threatening the police chief to not investigate him.
[03:00:47.009 --> 03:00:48.809]  I mean, talk about guilty.
[03:00:48.809 --> 03:00:49.790]  But what does she have to lose?
[03:00:49.790 --> 03:00:51.090]  She's going to prison if she doesn't.
[03:00:51.770 --> 03:00:53.231]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[03:01:19.295 --> 03:01:20.796]  Great talking to you guys again.
[03:01:20.796 --> 03:01:28.498]  Last time I talked, I think I talked to you and Dr. Group about the health benefits of mushrooms and fungi, if you remember that.
[03:01:28.498 --> 03:01:36.220]  I want to talk about Afghanistan, artificial intelligence, and Jeff Sessions.
[03:01:36.220 --> 03:01:37.641]  I'll start with Afghanistan.
[03:01:37.641 --> 03:01:43.702]  I'm not in support of going to Afghanistan, like many others.
[03:01:43.702 --> 03:01:45.963]  I like the idea of private contractors.
[03:01:47.035 --> 03:01:49.098]  Uh, doing the work instead of our troops.
[03:01:49.098 --> 03:01:53.764]  I think you mentioned that.
[03:01:53.764 --> 03:02:03.838]  With artificial intelligence, I do believe that's guiding all these hordes of liberal idiots to the events and just keeping them in their bubble.
[03:02:03.838 --> 03:02:04.158]  And you know,
[03:02:05.779 --> 03:02:07.300]  5G cell phone tower is out too.
[03:02:07.300 --> 03:02:08.661]  That's not helping anybody.
[03:02:08.661 --> 03:02:09.081]  No, I hear you.
[03:02:09.081 --> 03:02:10.282]  Let me get myself a stake on that.
[03:02:10.282 --> 03:02:11.343]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:02:11.343 --> 03:02:12.624]  Look, it's not my opinion.
[03:02:12.624 --> 03:02:14.585]  When we say AI, we mean algorithms.
[03:02:14.585 --> 03:02:16.266]  They've got computer systems.
[03:02:16.266 --> 03:02:20.128]  This came out earlier this year in the Associated Press.
[03:02:20.128 --> 03:02:20.529]  You name it.
[03:02:21.169 --> 03:02:26.954]  That Facebook says we're going to keep them alone, in their bubbles, fake bots, and then socially engineer them more.
[03:02:26.954 --> 03:02:32.239]  They admit, the establishment, Hillary in the WikiLeaks calls her constituents losers.
[03:02:32.239 --> 03:02:35.421]  That they want to make even bigger losers and keep them as losers.
[03:02:35.421 --> 03:02:38.224]  I mean, hell, that's the Cloward and Piven program, Jack Posobiec.
[03:02:39.994 --> 03:02:41.095]  Yeah, that's absolutely it, Alex.
[03:02:41.095 --> 03:02:51.948]  They're trying to put us in these social media ghettos, and you're seeing that already with the stifling of free thought, the stifling of what's going on with Google, with Facebook, with Twitter.
[03:02:51.948 --> 03:02:56.132]  We tried to call Google out on this, YouTube as well, for the firing of James Damore.
[03:02:56.132 --> 03:03:00.858]  We were going to hold protests across the country talking about this, talking about how we want
[03:03:01.118 --> 03:03:01.478]  That's right.
[03:03:28.806 --> 03:03:40.912]  Google is openly going out saying the alt-right or white supremacists are coming to kill us, when weeks before Charlottesville even happened, you and myself, Cernovich, launched on air protesting Google nationwide.
[03:03:40.912 --> 03:03:44.553]  And then the left said, we're going to come kill you if you come out and do this.
[03:03:44.553 --> 03:03:46.094]  So it just shows how sick they are.
[03:03:48.223 --> 03:03:55.789]  Yeah, it shows the way that they're targeting us, and it's essentially their dog whistle to say, this is where you should strike, come after these guys, Alex.
[03:03:55.789 --> 03:04:06.597]  My parents were getting suspicious packages found at their home from people in Oregon, from people in parts of Washington State, because their address, they found their address somehow.
[03:04:06.597 --> 03:04:08.779]  I told my parents, don't open that stuff, send it to the cops.
[03:04:09.059 --> 03:04:09.920]  That's what they did.
[03:04:09.920 --> 03:04:14.264]  This is the level of derangement that is happening, and it's all because of the mainstream media.
[03:04:14.264 --> 03:04:15.064]  Let me ask you that.
[03:04:15.064 --> 03:04:16.045]  You're answering my question.
[03:04:16.045 --> 03:04:19.348]  I want to come back and ask you and David about this and get to these calls, because I promise we would.
[03:04:19.348 --> 03:04:24.132]  Josh, Dan, Kevin, Jason, and Barb, as the callers will be able to get to.
[03:04:24.132 --> 03:04:25.733]  Why are they getting so deranged?
[03:04:25.733 --> 03:04:28.536]  Because it's not going to bully us into submitting.
[03:04:28.536 --> 03:04:30.337]  It's going to make hardworking, focused people.
[03:04:31.358 --> 03:04:49.299]  Really get aggressive now like I'm not spending any money with big corporations any globalists I'm gonna get totally focused on withdrawing from their system Personally while bombarding them with information warfare I mean we're gonna take this next level now because I've seen the committed authoritarianism of their minions
[03:04:51.829 --> 03:04:56.533]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[03:05:56.606 --> 03:05:58.688]  Research across the board is clear.
[03:05:58.688 --> 03:06:03.973]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[03:06:03.973 --> 03:06:07.696]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants the
[03:06:07.836 --> 03:06:11.278]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.

[03:06:14.461 --> 03:06:18.343]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.

[03:06:31.172 --> 03:06:33.215]  Iodine, nanosilver, and more.
[03:06:33.215 --> 03:06:41.504]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spirament was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new bubblegum-flavored Super Blue that is Spirament-free.

[03:06:59.499 --> 03:07:00.720]  A 360 win.

[03:07:07.285 --> 03:07:14.811]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[03:07:15.211 --> 03:07:20.294]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[03:07:20.294 --> 03:07:26.377]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[03:07:26.377 --> 03:07:34.182]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[03:07:34.182 --> 03:07:40.705]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[03:07:40.705 --> 03:07:42.206]  10% off on auto ship.
[03:07:42.346 --> 03:07:44.790]  Win-win-win at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:07:44.790 --> 03:07:46.773]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[03:07:46.773 --> 03:07:50.639]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[03:08:05.606 --> 03:08:08.248]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:08:08.248 --> 03:08:14.153]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:08:14.153 --> 03:08:16.815]  Look, I've seen reporters all over the country.
[03:08:16.815 --> 03:08:22.500]  We just had Millie and Gavin up there at the tragic events in Charlottesville.
[03:08:22.500 --> 03:08:26.683]  But when you see the media say the President didn't decry it, when he has nothing to do with it,
[03:08:27.864 --> 03:08:31.548]  And they lie and say he never did, but he does it four or five times.
[03:08:31.548 --> 03:08:38.074]  And then you know it's the globalists and Soros and the EU and the UN bringing in the unvetted Muslims who are actually killing people.
[03:08:38.074 --> 03:08:39.996]  You know, 500 to 1 what conservatives do.
[03:08:39.996 --> 03:08:50.667]  And then you find out everybody is an Obama supporter, and they've got State Department, CIA senior guys who are the first people on NBC, CBS, CNN,
[03:08:52.381 --> 03:08:57.263]  And then the police stand-downs, and the mayor, and it's like, my God, they staged this too.
[03:08:57.263 --> 03:08:59.244]  It's the boldness!
[03:08:59.244 --> 03:09:02.666]  They've got CIA people, the first being interviewed?
[03:09:02.666 --> 03:09:08.709]  I mean, you cannot make this stuff up, and then you go see their constituents and you say to them,
[03:09:09.670 --> 03:09:13.392]  When they're calling you a Nazi, you go, George Soros is a Nazi collaborator.
[03:09:13.392 --> 03:09:14.873]  F you, Nazi!
[03:09:14.873 --> 03:09:16.174]  They don't care about that.
[03:09:16.174 --> 03:09:21.158]  It's the feeling good, the being aggressive, the being the bullies.
[03:09:21.158 --> 03:09:26.461]  And so you hear about folks not baking, you know, gay couple's cake out in Oregon or Washington.
[03:09:26.461 --> 03:09:33.186]  I talked to Christians when I was out there, a lot of Asian, a lot of Chinese Christians, for some reason it was one of the main groups I ran into, and they said, listen, you don't understand.
[03:09:34.178 --> 03:09:36.919]  You'll be nice to your liberal gay neighbors.
[03:09:36.919 --> 03:09:41.000]  They will come over when they find out you're Christian and harass you, call the police on you until you're gone.
[03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:42.541]  They don't want anybody here.
[03:09:42.541 --> 03:09:55.405]  He goes, I was told by women and men, you understand, what you're experiencing, Alex, is what everybody experiences, and they even peck at each other all day, and that's what's made it a cult, is it's a huge, giant cult.
[03:09:55.405 --> 03:09:57.045]  Jack Posobiec, I mean, what's happening?
[03:09:57.045 --> 03:09:59.786]  Because I can't describe how whacked out these people are.
[03:10:01.337 --> 03:10:03.440]  Alex, I saw the same thing when I was in Seattle.
[03:10:03.440 --> 03:10:05.242]  We actually just have some breaking news.
[03:10:05.242 --> 03:10:06.805]  AP is reporting this.
[03:10:06.805 --> 03:10:08.267]  You guys can go and look.
[03:10:08.267 --> 03:10:15.116]  That a man was arrested in Houston for planting bombs, explosives, at a Confederate statue.
[03:10:15.874 --> 03:10:19.376]  Uh, this is the level that these people are going to.
[03:10:19.376 --> 03:10:23.257]  The level of derangement to where they're actually using IEDs.
[03:10:23.257 --> 03:10:26.418]  This is the stuff that we saw from Al-Qaeda and ISIS overseas.
[03:10:26.418 --> 03:10:28.279]  They're using that in our own country.
[03:10:28.279 --> 03:10:29.540]  These left-wing groups.
[03:10:29.540 --> 03:10:30.820]  These alt-left terrorists.
[03:10:30.820 --> 03:10:32.541]  This is actual terrorism.
[03:10:33.302 --> 03:10:34.523]  And by the way, that's confirmed.
[03:10:34.523 --> 03:10:35.804]  That's the next point.
[03:10:35.804 --> 03:10:43.794]  I didn't even get to the clips today where we have CNN, MSNB, all of them every day saying terrorism by Antifa is good.
[03:10:43.794 --> 03:10:47.097]  Saying, kind of like, hunt Republicans, go out and kill them.
[03:10:47.097 --> 03:10:48.099]  Why are they doing that, Jack?
[03:10:49.605 --> 03:10:53.907]  Because they're trying to push peace through violence, which is an actual line from 1984.
[03:10:53.907 --> 03:10:55.248]  War is peace.
[03:10:55.248 --> 03:11:00.070]  They're trying to tell you that all of this violence is justified because of what you're doing.
[03:11:00.070 --> 03:11:02.031]  Alex, I lived in China for two years.
[03:11:02.031 --> 03:11:04.913]  I studied the Maoist cultural revolution.
[03:11:04.913 --> 03:11:12.376]  For ten years, they ginned up the youth, they ginned up the Communist Party elites to go into the streets to commit absolute murder.
[03:11:12.376 --> 03:11:14.097]  Oh yeah, I've been in colleges everywhere.
[03:11:14.097 --> 03:11:17.119]  The young groups tell you, Antifa tells you, we are Maoist.
[03:11:17.939 --> 03:11:21.022]  We are Maoist Youth Brigades, that's the model.
[03:11:21.022 --> 03:11:29.789]  And that's when Maoists, the main difference between Maoism and other types of Communism and Marxism was brutality and grotesque torture.
[03:11:29.789 --> 03:11:32.771]  From the children in college students, from the college.
[03:11:32.771 --> 03:11:34.292]  They called them the Red Guards.
[03:11:34.292 --> 03:11:34.653]  Yes.
[03:11:34.653 --> 03:11:36.494]  They called them the Red Guards.
[03:11:36.494 --> 03:11:38.916]  You guys can, we'll come on later, we'll do a show about it.
[03:11:38.916 --> 03:11:41.218]  No, no, no, we have Red Guards here that say they want to kill me.
[03:11:42.551 --> 03:11:46.612]  Yeah, they have them in Arizona, I think, and they actually go out and train with guns.
[03:11:46.612 --> 03:11:54.293]  And even though they're not very good with guns, these are people who are actually getting armed who are saying that violence and murder is justified.
[03:11:54.293 --> 03:11:59.254]  In China, they would go after their own teachers, they would go after their own principals, they would tear down the authority.
[03:11:59.254 --> 03:12:05.895]  That's right, they're the enforcers, and that's why these young punks are into it, because they're told by Soros, I'm going to be the boss now.
[03:12:05.895 --> 03:12:08.636]  And we learned they're getting people on the Austin Police Review Board.
[03:12:10.663 --> 03:12:15.468]  That's excellent, and I hope that we can actually expose more of what's going on and set up more of these.
[03:12:15.468 --> 03:12:16.789]  Look, these are kids.
[03:12:16.789 --> 03:12:18.150]  These are people they're going to.
[03:12:18.150 --> 03:12:20.413]  Their brains haven't completely fully formed yet.
[03:12:20.413 --> 03:12:22.495]  They haven't completely figured out how this world works.
[03:12:22.495 --> 03:12:23.496]  They're going to them.
[03:12:23.496 --> 03:12:27.780]  They're feeding them a pack of lies, and they're telling them that these people are trying to stop you.
[03:12:27.780 --> 03:12:28.781]  They're reporting to regular...
[03:12:29.361 --> 03:12:34.045]  Traditional conservatives, regular people... And David, that's the next point, and I'm going to skip this break so we have more time.
[03:12:34.045 --> 03:12:36.146]  Jack Posobiec is here, but I've got to go to these calls.
[03:12:36.146 --> 03:12:38.788]  And Jack, we're finishing each other's sentences, because he didn't even know.
[03:12:38.788 --> 03:12:39.849]  I know about Red Guard.
[03:12:39.849 --> 03:12:42.411]  He knows about Red Guard for being, I guess, the naval intelligence.
[03:12:42.411 --> 03:12:43.331]  You're over here.
[03:12:43.331 --> 03:12:49.876]  We are facing hardcore George Soros, mega banks, University of Texas openly funds the Red Guard.
[03:12:49.876 --> 03:12:50.997]  Why do the ultra-rich
[03:12:51.377 --> 03:12:59.659]  We're reaching the final stages of this because the final stages are when they take down the monuments, when they destroy the visual symbols of the country.
[03:12:59.659 --> 03:13:01.880]  They've already destroyed our legal system.
[03:13:01.880 --> 03:13:04.681]  They have wrecked our... They've already said the American flag's next!
[03:13:18.024 --> 03:13:20.146]  Yeah, and that's what we see them doing.
[03:13:20.146 --> 03:13:24.989]  You know, one of the things I talked about this morning, Alex, was, you know, jokers to the left of me, clowns to the right.
[03:13:24.989 --> 03:13:27.631]  Here I am stuck in the middle with you, right?
[03:13:27.631 --> 03:13:36.657]  What we have to get through to people is that the left and the right, the anti-fascists and the Ku Klux Klan are not polar opposites of each other.
[03:13:36.657 --> 03:13:38.358]  They belong in the same spot.
[03:13:38.358 --> 03:13:47.605]  And the reason that they get away with this is because they have sold us a paradigm that's like looking at the map of where you're going to go on the edge of the map.
[03:13:47.745 --> 03:13:52.226]  And what you have to do is you have to lift this thing up and look at it straight on so you get a two-dimensional picture.
[03:13:52.226 --> 03:14:05.449]  Yeah, there's a left, a right, a center, but there's also up to libertarianism, down to authoritarianism, and down at the bottom is where the Stalinists and the fascists are together, because neither one of them allow you to have any freedom.
[03:14:05.449 --> 03:14:09.910]  And so that's the key thing, is that they take away your freedom, they take away your free speech, just as we've seen.
[03:14:09.910 --> 03:14:10.830]  Or this paradigm.
[03:14:11.870 --> 03:14:13.271]  On one end, anarchy.
[03:14:13.271 --> 03:14:14.952]  On the other end, absolute government.
[03:14:14.952 --> 03:14:16.093]  We know we don't want pure anarchy.
[03:14:16.093 --> 03:14:17.013]  It never works anyways.
[03:14:17.013 --> 03:14:20.996]  It always turns into road warrior and shifts back to total tyranny.
[03:14:20.996 --> 03:14:28.421]  But you want to be 90% towards anarchy, a constitutional republic on a compendium of liberty versus tyranny.
[03:14:28.421 --> 03:14:31.683]  And our republic is 90% towards the anarchy.
[03:14:31.683 --> 03:14:32.603]  That's where you want to be.
[03:14:32.603 --> 03:14:36.446]  Instead, all forms of authoritarianism lie on the political left.
[03:14:36.906 --> 03:14:38.487]  You can also argue it's a horseshoe.
[03:14:38.487 --> 03:14:39.828]  There's different paradigms of seeing it.
[03:14:39.828 --> 03:14:45.211]  And the social engineers in their real textbooks admit all this and show all the models.
[03:14:45.211 --> 03:14:52.536]  And then Carol Quigley, one of their top people, Bill Clinton's mentor at Georgetown, explains, we're going to fund leftist authoritarians, right-wing authoritarians.
[03:14:52.536 --> 03:14:54.017]  We're going to destroy the family.
[03:14:54.017 --> 03:14:57.859]  We're going to have an end of revolutions because we're going to end upward mobility.
[03:14:57.859 --> 03:15:00.240]  Human mobility is what creates revolutions.
[03:15:00.240 --> 03:15:05.524]  We're going to have a permanent revolution and then phase out the underclass all the way with sterilization.
[03:15:06.084 --> 03:15:07.005]  And we're here!
[03:15:07.005 --> 03:15:08.247]  And they're now ending the family.
[03:15:08.247 --> 03:15:12.132]  Let's go to some phone calls with Jack Posobiec and David Knight here riding shotgun with us.
[03:15:12.132 --> 03:15:14.435]  Josh, in Colorado, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:15:16.175 --> 03:15:18.576]  Thanks Alex, long time listener, about 10 years.
[03:15:18.576 --> 03:15:20.856]  Wanted to tell you a quick story.
[03:15:20.856 --> 03:15:23.637]  I've been married to my wife for about two years.
[03:15:23.637 --> 03:15:37.180]  She immigrated here when she was five from the Philippines and part of her family married into a black family and they have completely thrown me and my wife out of the family because we support the NRA.
[03:15:37.180 --> 03:15:39.461]  Completely lost their cool
[03:15:40.101 --> 03:15:44.825]  Over this Charlottesville thing and calling me a racist.
[03:15:44.825 --> 03:15:47.787]  How can I be a racist if I'm married to an Asian woman?
[03:15:47.787 --> 03:15:48.928]  It's a power play!
[03:15:49.946 --> 03:16:03.830]  People that don't have any power are taught by the media, be mean to everybody, you're in a culture war, throw your weight around, but really they're just ostracizing themselves into a left implosion, like a star that doesn't go supernova, instead shrinks into a dwarf.
[03:16:03.830 --> 03:16:09.592]  They know they're going into a failed political party, so now they're going more into a cult.
[03:16:09.592 --> 03:16:18.655]  See, it's like, you know, when other cults get in trouble, they stop expanding, they implode into a more hardcore unit, like what you've seen with certain groups here in the US.
[03:16:19.275 --> 03:16:26.122]  Well, you know, Alex, we've had this article that's been floating around for the last couple of days on InfoWars about this guy in Colorado attacked with a knife.
[03:16:26.122 --> 03:16:28.244]  The guy yells at him, you're a fascist, you're a Nazi.
[03:16:28.244 --> 03:16:28.584]  Why?
[03:16:28.584 --> 03:16:32.728]  Because he had his hair was long on the top and very short on the sides.
[03:16:32.728 --> 03:16:34.690]  Now, my son wears his hair that way.
[03:16:34.690 --> 03:16:35.931]  He's not at all like it.
[03:16:35.931 --> 03:16:38.113]  But that's the stylish haircut.
[03:16:38.113 --> 03:16:38.534]  Exactly.
[03:16:38.534 --> 03:16:43.719]  But I mean, they can seize on anything, whether it's a gun ownership or whether it's a guy's haircut.
[03:16:44.139 --> 03:16:47.343]  Or you're a Republican on the city council, I'm going to shoot you in the head.
[03:16:47.343 --> 03:16:47.984]  Yeah.
[03:16:47.984 --> 03:16:52.310]  And then media, I don't get what Blitzer and all them having guests on legitimizing this thing.
[03:16:52.310 --> 03:16:56.996]  If this really kicks off, Posobiec, I mean, I've looked at all the demographics here.
[03:16:56.996 --> 03:17:01.061]  If there's a real civil war, I guess they think we're going to roll over and just let them kill us?
[03:17:02.298 --> 03:17:08.567]  Yeah, that thing about the haircuts, you know, that's exactly how the United States Marines are required to wear their hair.
[03:17:08.567 --> 03:17:13.493]  So I don't know what's going to happen when these Antifa guys go after a whole bunch of Marines for seeing that haircut.
[03:17:13.493 --> 03:17:15.036]  I'd kind of like to see that, to be honest.
[03:17:17.298 --> 03:17:18.359]  Anything else, Josh?
[03:17:18.359 --> 03:17:20.880]  They're taking anything and they're saying it's groupthink.
[03:17:20.880 --> 03:17:33.549]  It's groupthink and it's mass hysteria that's being pitched to fever high levels because they've created these social media ghettos where one side believes one thing, they don't hear any opposing voices, they don't go out and seek other sources.
[03:17:33.549 --> 03:17:34.770]  I read other sources.
[03:17:34.770 --> 03:17:35.750]  I read liberal blogs.
[03:17:35.750 --> 03:17:37.551]  I've got to see what they're saying about me, right?
[03:17:37.551 --> 03:17:41.354]  I read the mainstream media to explain to everyone else what is going on.
[03:17:41.354 --> 03:17:41.654]  Absolutely.
[03:17:41.654 --> 03:17:42.395]  I want to go back to Josh.
[03:17:42.995 --> 03:17:46.880]  I want to go back to Josh and a few other callers here, but my wife has used Uber.
[03:17:46.880 --> 03:17:48.202]  She gets the messages.
[03:17:48.202 --> 03:17:49.604]  People that work for banks are getting it.
[03:17:49.604 --> 03:17:51.226]  It's like there are Nazis everywhere.
[03:17:51.226 --> 03:17:52.708]  Report them if you see them, please.
[03:17:52.708 --> 03:17:53.529]  It's very dangerous.
[03:17:53.529 --> 03:17:54.671]  Nothing's safe.
[03:17:54.671 --> 03:17:59.057]  And it's just hysteria made up that there are Nazis just everywhere.
[03:18:00.814 --> 03:18:02.135]  Who knew Brad Pitt was a Nazi?
[03:18:02.135 --> 03:18:04.498]  They're under every rock.
[03:18:04.498 --> 03:18:05.639]  And it's how you define it.
[03:18:05.639 --> 03:18:08.361]  You can define it any way you want, and then it's self-evident.
[03:18:08.361 --> 03:18:09.923]  Well, I was in a hotel yesterday.
[03:18:09.923 --> 03:18:15.588]  I was staying at the Westin, and there was like some big basketball tournament with a bunch of college and NBA guys there.
[03:18:15.588 --> 03:18:22.015]  I mean, they were all like seven feet tall, and almost every black guy had that Beckham haircut, because you don't want to be sweating and stuff when you're out there.
[03:18:22.015 --> 03:18:24.157]  They all had like, I didn't know they were all white supremacists too.
[03:18:25.256 --> 03:18:30.517]  Well, the thing is, Alex, is that they don't believe that there's any such thing as objective truth.
[03:18:30.517 --> 03:18:35.099]  This is the postmodern world that we live in, and so they have a truth, and I have a truth.
[03:18:35.099 --> 03:18:41.680]  My truth is different because I'm a white person than somebody else's truth, and so they see this as a fundamental inability.
[03:18:41.680 --> 03:18:46.562]  You know, you cannot get through these people because they will not allow you to have a real discussion.
[03:18:46.562 --> 03:18:48.522]  Well, we both kind of got the... Shut it down.
[03:18:48.522 --> 03:18:51.343]  We've got kind of a little bit of the halfway comeovers going on here.
[03:18:51.803 --> 03:18:53.084]  Does that mean we're white supremacists?
[03:18:53.084 --> 03:18:55.066]  I don't know what white group that puts me in.
[03:18:55.066 --> 03:18:56.608]  I'm growing my hair out, guys.
[03:18:56.608 --> 03:18:58.190]  I'm just growing my hair completely out.
[03:18:58.190 --> 03:19:00.011]  I gotta be safe while I'm here in D.C.
[03:19:00.011 --> 03:19:01.433]  I gotta be safe.
[03:19:01.433 --> 03:19:03.395]  Well, it just shows how there's nothing real.
[03:19:03.395 --> 03:19:06.018]  So they pick some old statues and they pick a guy's haircut.
[03:19:06.018 --> 03:19:10.042]  And that's why I've looked at the numbers of whites being attacked 25 to 1 by blacks.
[03:19:10.042 --> 03:19:10.723]  Exploded!
[03:19:11.283 --> 03:19:13.565]  And I've just said, the average black person didn't like that.
[03:19:13.565 --> 03:19:18.948]  There's a large enough minority of blacks that are so racist now that it looks worse than the Klan attacks in the South ever.
[03:19:18.948 --> 03:19:23.631]  I mean, we need to take people getting attacked and hurt and show how this is all globalist operations.
[03:19:23.631 --> 03:19:26.193]  Josh, anything else?
[03:19:26.193 --> 03:19:31.857]  Yeah, I just want to say, I mean, my life is a conundrum, essentially, to that perspective.
[03:19:31.857 --> 03:19:33.398]  You know, I support freedom.
[03:19:33.398 --> 03:19:34.599]  I like Martin Luther King.
[03:19:34.599 --> 03:19:36.260]  I am not racist.
[03:19:36.260 --> 03:19:37.661]  I married a Filipino woman.
[03:19:38.730 --> 03:19:43.712]  That's why they hate me even more than anything, because I am the exact opposite of what they're saying I'm supposed to be.
[03:19:43.712 --> 03:19:47.694]  Because look, look, race is pushed by governments because it works.
[03:19:47.694 --> 03:19:51.016]  And the Democrats and the globalists are cold-blooded and they're using it.
[03:19:51.016 --> 03:19:52.757]  And we've just got to point out that's what they're doing.
[03:19:52.757 --> 03:19:53.397]  Thank you, Josh.
[03:19:53.397 --> 03:19:56.318]  But I love how folks that aren't racist keep saying, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.
[03:19:56.318 --> 03:19:57.119]  I don't care anymore.
[03:19:57.779 --> 03:20:01.300]  I want free market prosperity for everybody, and I'm not going to kiss folks' butt.
[03:20:01.300 --> 03:20:03.881]  I've not done anything wrong, and I don't care if you're white or black.
[03:20:03.881 --> 03:20:06.461]  You try to shoot or stab me, I'm going to bust a cap in your ass.
[03:20:06.461 --> 03:20:09.882]  And let's understand why Soros and these people are focusing on race in America.
[03:20:09.882 --> 03:20:14.443]  When they've had their revolutions in Europe, they did it based on economic classes.
[03:20:14.443 --> 03:20:23.806]  Here in America, yeah, we've got differences in economics, but people generally believe that in the American system you had mobility, unlike what they believed in Europe.
[03:20:23.806 --> 03:20:25.186]  So here they can focus on
[03:20:25.606 --> 03:20:27.807]  The KGB talked about this in the 1960s when they tried to infiltrate.
[03:20:27.807 --> 03:20:29.268]  They said, America isn't about class.
[03:20:29.268 --> 03:20:31.149]  In America, the fracture points are on
[03:20:49.975 --> 03:20:51.876]  Racial and cultural lines.
[03:20:51.876 --> 03:20:55.157]  That's what the KGB did when they were funding the New Black Panthers.
[03:20:55.157 --> 03:20:57.637]  That's what they did when they were funding a lot of these racial groups.
[03:20:57.637 --> 03:21:06.220]  And we saw in the last eight years, the Barack Obama administration did everything they could, and the left did everything they could, to inflame racial tensions, not unite the country.
[03:21:06.220 --> 03:21:07.841]  And don't people see that?
[03:21:07.841 --> 03:21:09.361]  I mean, it's the craziest thing.
[03:21:09.361 --> 03:21:11.762]  Dan, in Indiana, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:21:14.355 --> 03:21:16.697]  Bible Dan with the Bible in his hand.
[03:21:16.697 --> 03:21:17.338]  Hey, buddy.
[03:21:17.338 --> 03:21:19.079]  That's been a long time since you heard that.
[03:21:19.079 --> 03:21:20.240]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:21:20.240 --> 03:21:20.441]  Good.
[03:21:20.441 --> 03:21:23.564]  Yeah, you've been calling for like 10 years.
[03:21:23.564 --> 03:21:24.364]  Yeah.
[03:21:24.364 --> 03:21:28.708]  What I want to say is Heather Hayes did not exist.
[03:21:28.708 --> 03:21:36.896]  She could have been one of these kidnapped kids from the MKUltra, but I cannot find any evidence that she ever existed.
[03:21:37.682 --> 03:21:40.844]  A lot of folks are saying that, and I'm not saying that she didn't exist.
[03:21:40.844 --> 03:21:42.564]  I think her mom was very real.
[03:21:42.564 --> 03:21:44.105]  I think people do get killed.
[03:21:44.105 --> 03:21:45.446]  People do get run over.
[03:21:45.446 --> 03:21:47.527]  The driver, though, it turns out, was a leftist.
[03:21:47.527 --> 03:21:50.448]  Looks like he's on a bunch of drugs.
[03:21:50.448 --> 03:22:00.273]  All the managers of it were formally working for Obama just a year ago, and Black Lives Matter and Soros and Antifa and every other group will occupy.
[03:22:00.273 --> 03:22:04.335]  And so then, magically, they're leading this thing all perfectly, and there's a police stand-down.
[03:22:04.335 --> 03:22:05.996]  And our reporters reported on the stand-down.
[03:22:05.996 --> 03:22:06.837]  That's all confirmed.
[03:22:07.813 --> 03:22:09.015]  So what do you think, Posobiec?
[03:22:09.015 --> 03:22:10.637]  I mean, what do you call it?
[03:22:10.637 --> 03:22:12.380]  The whole thing's not staged.
[03:22:12.380 --> 03:22:13.962]  But then I never even said actors.
[03:22:13.962 --> 03:22:15.684]  They misrepresented what I said.
[03:22:15.684 --> 03:22:17.948]  And then it turns out that they did hire some actors.
[03:22:17.948 --> 03:22:20.651]  Democratic Party did have some there.
[03:22:20.651 --> 03:22:22.334]  But I guess that was just to agitate.
[03:22:24.497 --> 03:22:25.317]  You set up, Alex.
[03:22:25.317 --> 03:22:25.938]  You set up.
[03:22:25.938 --> 03:22:29.460]  I mean, there are people there on both sides that actually are believing these things.
[03:22:29.460 --> 03:22:41.106]  But the problem is, they're drawn in by people, these agitators, that are paid at the higher levels to sort of rile everybody up, to inflame the emotions, to target... Well, that's what the ad says!
[03:22:41.106 --> 03:22:42.567]  The ad says to agitate!
[03:22:43.871 --> 03:22:48.517]  Yes, they want to target you right at that lizard brain, right at that deep level of your cortex.
[03:22:48.517 --> 03:22:58.648]  They want to go after people to fire up them so that they want violence, they want to commit violence, and that eventually because it's the hate, they just increase the hate.
[03:22:58.648 --> 03:23:00.931]  They want people on both sides to hate each other.
[03:23:00.931 --> 03:23:04.095]  Alex, there are now chats that are coming out from the other side.
[03:23:04.435 --> 03:23:10.765]  Where there were people in these chat rooms of these extremist groups saying, run them over with cars, run them over with cars.
[03:23:10.765 --> 03:23:12.608]  They were sending pictures saying, doing this.
[03:23:12.608 --> 03:23:14.531]  This is up on Zero Hedge, anyone can see it.
[03:23:14.531 --> 03:23:18.557]  Where they were telling people to do this, putting up the images, and then eventually someone did it.
[03:23:18.557 --> 03:23:19.419]  So that's how you do.
[03:23:19.799 --> 03:23:23.882]  They say you manipulate people's minds by sewing them the image, generating the hate.
[03:23:23.882 --> 03:23:32.609]  Sure, just like Democrats have been saying Republicans are going to get killed, Trump's going to get killed, and then finally they see Alex Jones or Jack Posobiec walking down the street or David Nye, and it's like, you're a Nazi!
[03:23:32.609 --> 03:23:33.770]  I'm going to kill you!
[03:23:33.770 --> 03:23:34.330]  I'm not kidding.
[03:23:34.330 --> 03:23:36.932]  I don't want to make a big deal of this because it's so crazy.
[03:23:36.932 --> 03:23:45.359]  I'm stepping, and I see this car sitting there, coming out of a parking garage yesterday, in Seattle, right by the Westin, and I go, I'm going to stop.
[03:23:46.590 --> 03:23:51.692]  And then the guy doesn't go and I start stepping and he jolts it forward like he's going to hit me.
[03:23:51.692 --> 03:23:54.973]  I get back out of the way and I go, no, no, that wasn't on purpose.
[03:23:54.973 --> 03:23:57.754]  And all of a sudden the window goes down and he goes, F you Nazi!
[03:23:57.754 --> 03:23:59.235]  And it's like going like this.
[03:23:59.235 --> 03:24:02.496]  And I went, get out of the car, coward!
[03:24:02.496 --> 03:24:03.596]  And my wife's like, no, no, no.
[03:24:03.596 --> 03:24:04.577]  I'm like, I just can't do it.
[03:24:04.577 --> 03:24:05.137]  I go, get out!
[03:24:06.164 --> 03:24:09.106]  And he goes, oh yeah, just get out of the car, man.
[03:24:09.106 --> 03:24:11.528]  See how, you know, you're a big man, you know, you're a coward.
[03:24:11.528 --> 03:24:13.470]  And your girlfriend knows you're a coward.
[03:24:13.470 --> 03:24:20.715]  And then he rides along beside us for about 30 seconds going F-U, calling me, you know, sexual names and homophobic names, you use that term.
[03:24:20.715 --> 03:24:25.819]  That's what I've noticed on the left behind the scenes are the most racist, spewing, nastiest scum.
[03:24:25.819 --> 03:24:28.881]  But he was safe because he was in his two-ton vehicle.
[03:24:28.881 --> 03:24:30.563]  He was in a newer model Range Rover.
[03:24:30.563 --> 03:24:30.863]  Yeah.
[03:24:35.026 --> 03:24:35.526]  Oh, there you go.
[03:24:35.526 --> 03:24:37.348]  But he wanted to have the semblance of a tough guy.
[03:24:37.348 --> 03:24:39.909]  It's like, dude, you just act like you want to run me over.
[03:24:39.909 --> 03:24:45.413]  I got enough adrenaline right now that I'm not going to be Mr. Tough Guy, but he's going to have a big problem.
[03:24:45.413 --> 03:24:45.753]  Yeah.
[03:24:45.753 --> 03:24:49.696]  Anyways, why do you think I was attacked by 97 percent white males?
[03:24:49.696 --> 03:24:51.517]  Are they trying to virtue signal or what's going on?
[03:24:52.715 --> 03:24:58.957]  It's partially virtue signaling, but I think it's also part of this testosterone issue that's going on in our country.
[03:24:58.957 --> 03:25:06.899]  Because men are experiencing this lower testosterone, but at the same time, they have an innate desire, an innate nature to be more aggressive.
[03:25:06.899 --> 03:25:08.999]  That's just simply, it's biological.
[03:25:08.999 --> 03:25:11.540]  And the media tells him it's okay as long as it's Alex Jones.
[03:25:12.301 --> 03:25:14.502]  Right, and so, you want to expound that on something.
[03:25:14.502 --> 03:25:16.784]  We see this in the animal world all over the place.
[03:25:16.784 --> 03:25:38.698]  So, when they're told, ah, this is a target that it's okay to expend some of that testosterone, because remember, these people are taught by society, they're taught by institutions, you have to be quiet, you have to be good, you have to be nice, but then they bring up Alex Jones, or somebody wearing a MAGA hat and say, this is the enemy, turn it all on this guy, so it's all this pent-up emotion, this pent-up testosterone rage, and then you're pointing it, directing it at one target.
[03:25:38.698 --> 03:25:39.919]  Unfortunately, in this case, it's you and me.
[03:25:40.629 --> 03:25:41.149]  I don't know.
[03:25:41.149 --> 03:25:42.850]  I looked at that guy as you were running that thing.
[03:25:42.850 --> 03:25:48.233]  I don't know if he had any testosterone.
[03:25:48.233 --> 03:25:52.475]  But he saw me as such an enemy, he came out and went, F you Nazi.
[03:25:52.475 --> 03:25:55.236]  So I said, hey, come here and tell me why you say that.
[03:25:55.236 --> 03:25:58.998]  Runs over, starts bumping into me, throws coffee in my face, and it's just like,
[03:26:00.322 --> 03:26:03.404]  And he was getting off on walking like a goblin.
[03:26:03.404 --> 03:26:05.425]  I mean, he actually gets off on it.
[03:26:05.425 --> 03:26:06.726]  And it turns out he is an actor.
[03:26:06.726 --> 03:26:07.686]  I didn't hire him.
[03:26:07.686 --> 03:26:12.229]  But I mean, every one of these guys, you can't swing a stick in a liberal heroin den and not hit an actor.
[03:26:12.229 --> 03:26:13.490]  They're all actors.
[03:26:13.490 --> 03:26:14.871]  Or comedians.
[03:26:14.871 --> 03:26:16.212]  Yeah.
[03:26:16.212 --> 03:26:17.753]  We saw the same thing at the Lennon statue.
[03:26:17.753 --> 03:26:19.494]  And I was two days before you, Alex.
[03:26:19.494 --> 03:26:25.918]  And these people, they would come up to you screaming, drive-bying the cars, flipping you off, calling you a Nazi, calling you this and that.
[03:26:25.918 --> 03:26:27.679]  And I would see people on the street and I would say,
[03:26:28.735 --> 03:26:29.996]  Would you like to come talk to me?
[03:26:29.996 --> 03:26:33.018]  Would you like to have a discussion about what statues we should have up?
[03:26:33.018 --> 03:26:34.579]  Or what's going on in our country?
[03:26:34.579 --> 03:26:35.599]  The things that are happening?
[03:26:35.599 --> 03:26:36.280]  I'm a nice guy.
[03:26:36.280 --> 03:26:37.280]  I'm a personable guy.
[03:26:37.280 --> 03:26:38.161]  I'm pretty approachable.
[03:26:38.161 --> 03:26:40.562]  I like to come to things with a smile on my face.
[03:26:40.562 --> 03:26:42.804]  But these people, they see it and it just triggers them.
[03:26:42.804 --> 03:26:43.264]  They turn on.
[03:26:43.264 --> 03:26:44.905]  It's like the running of the bulls when they see the red.
[03:26:46.141 --> 03:27:01.148]  That's right, well they see you're successful and confident and that's what scares me is they hate success and they don't get... America's where you actually have a shot at that and that's in these incredible videos with Ellen Schroyer, which you're probably playing again in the next segment if you have time David, they're so riveting.
[03:27:01.148 --> 03:27:05.750]  It took Daria like hours to bleep all these out though because they're cussing every three words.
[03:27:05.750 --> 03:27:09.052]  And they're saying, death to America, we hate America, it's the worst country.
[03:27:09.052 --> 03:27:10.352]  He's like, well why don't you leave?
[03:27:10.352 --> 03:27:11.673]  I am, I'm going to go to Switzerland.
[03:27:12.153 --> 03:27:18.016]  He's like, dude, you gotta have five million dollars and a trade they want to let you in.
[03:27:18.016 --> 03:27:20.678]  I mean, they're just so stupid!
[03:27:20.678 --> 03:27:23.639]  And he's like, what statue is that they're taking down?
[03:27:23.639 --> 03:27:24.400]  Oh, a racist?
[03:27:24.400 --> 03:27:24.960]  Well, who is it?
[03:27:24.960 --> 03:27:25.661]  We don't know!
[03:27:25.661 --> 03:27:28.382]  It's Robert E. Lee, dumbass!
[03:27:28.382 --> 03:27:29.783]  The former head of the Northern Army!
[03:27:31.471 --> 03:27:35.156]  I asked him, I said, did you ask him when the Civil War started, when it ended?
[03:27:35.156 --> 03:27:36.999]  Because they don't know anything about any of this.
[03:27:36.999 --> 03:27:39.082]  I mean, they're attacking statues of Lincoln.
[03:27:39.082 --> 03:27:43.148]  They don't even know Robert E. Lee's, you know, father and grandfather were in the Revolutionary War.
[03:27:43.148 --> 03:27:44.851]  They don't know anything.
[03:27:44.851 --> 03:27:45.632]  Oh, I know.
[03:27:45.632 --> 03:27:46.353]  Yeah, I know.
[03:27:46.932 --> 03:27:47.812]  It's crazy.
[03:27:47.812 --> 03:27:52.274]  But they don't think they have to know anything, because they have a truth.
[03:27:52.274 --> 03:27:53.994]  And you have a truth.
[03:27:53.994 --> 03:27:55.315]  And so... It's delusion.
[03:27:55.315 --> 03:27:58.155]  They're not going to stop with these statues either.
[03:27:58.155 --> 03:27:59.596]  They're not going to stop with these ones.
[03:27:59.596 --> 03:28:02.737]  They're going to turn it on and say, well, you know what?
[03:28:02.737 --> 03:28:06.498]  One day after Trump said they're going to want Jefferson, they wanted Jefferson.
[03:28:06.498 --> 03:28:08.439]  And it was the Hamilton actor who said that.
[03:28:08.439 --> 03:28:14.480]  What's coming after is the works of Washington and Jefferson, the Constitution, the Declaration, the founding.
[03:28:14.480 --> 03:28:15.821]  You can see where this stuff is going.
[03:28:15.821 --> 03:28:16.661]  They're going to say, well, that was
[03:28:17.293 --> 03:28:18.514]  Oh, they admit that, they admit that.
[03:28:18.514 --> 03:28:32.720]  And I was talking to a guy that grew up in Hungary under communism, or was it Romania, and he said, first they target one little thing about the past, and then they put it onto everything, then they overthrow your whole system, and you wake up total slaves, and all they use is religion and race to control you.
[03:28:32.720 --> 03:28:35.501]  He said, I grew up there, this is it, I'm warning you.
[03:28:36.442 --> 03:28:38.404]  Yeah, and let me tell you who started that too.
[03:28:38.404 --> 03:28:40.706]  It was Nikki Haley in South Carolina.
[03:28:40.706 --> 03:28:53.476]  She found that picture, you know, the murderer Dylan Roof, who goes in and in cold blood shoots some black people in church and then they find a picture where he's got a confederate flag and they go on a holy jihad against all symbols like that.
[03:28:53.476 --> 03:28:56.919]  And you know, when you look at the confederate flag... And notice a few events they've kicked this off.
[03:28:57.079 --> 03:28:57.379]  Yeah.
[03:28:57.379 --> 03:28:57.860]  Sorry.
[03:28:57.860 --> 03:28:59.981]  But you look at how they co-opted that symbol.
[03:28:59.981 --> 03:29:03.303]  Well, they've also co-opted the Christian cross the Ku Klux Klan did.
[03:29:03.303 --> 03:29:12.429]  They burned... I was about to say, the Confederate battle flag isn't even the flag of the South, but if you know what it is, it's the, what's his name, St.
[03:29:12.429 --> 03:29:13.389]  whatever from Scotland.
[03:29:13.389 --> 03:29:13.610]  St.
[03:29:13.610 --> 03:29:13.930]  Andrews.
[03:29:13.930 --> 03:29:14.410]  It's the St.
[03:29:14.410 --> 03:29:14.950]  Andrews Cross.
[03:29:16.011 --> 03:29:22.994]  So now crosses... I mean... Well, they've got to take it off the subway because they've got tile at a crossroads in New York City.
[03:29:22.994 --> 03:29:25.075]  So they said, that looks too much like a Confederate flag.
[03:29:25.075 --> 03:29:25.855]  Urge it!
[03:29:25.855 --> 03:29:26.815]  Take the tiles off!
[03:29:26.815 --> 03:29:28.476]  Alright, Jack Mosobic, great job.
[03:29:28.476 --> 03:29:31.017]  People should get your book and find out more.
[03:29:31.017 --> 03:29:33.618]  CitizensforTrump.com, Jack Mosobic on Twitter.
[03:29:33.618 --> 03:29:34.078]  Amazing.
[03:29:34.078 --> 03:29:36.539]  More calls, David Knight and myself straight ahead.
[03:29:36.539 --> 03:29:38.320]  We're going right to Kevin and Jason and Barb.
[03:29:38.320 --> 03:29:38.800]  Stay with us.
[03:29:38.800 --> 03:29:39.880]  Infowars.com.
[03:29:39.880 --> 03:29:41.281]  They hate the website.
[03:29:41.281 --> 03:29:42.301]  Newswars.com.
[03:29:42.301 --> 03:29:43.362]  Newswars.com.
[03:29:43.362 --> 03:29:43.902]  Newswars.com.
[03:29:51.185 --> 03:29:53.286]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com.
[03:29:53.286 --> 03:29:55.587]  Today I want to talk to you about guns.
[03:29:55.587 --> 03:29:56.647]  Why we have them.
[03:29:56.647 --> 03:30:00.029]  Why the Bill of Rights guarantees that we can have them.
[03:30:00.029 --> 03:30:05.531]  And why my right to have a gun is more important than your right to rail against it in the press.
[03:30:05.531 --> 03:30:12.454]  I believe every good journalist needs to know why the Second Amendment must be considered more essential than the First Amendment.
[03:30:12.574 --> 03:30:23.300]  This may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated, dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Redcoats.
[03:30:23.300 --> 03:30:26.942]  No, it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[03:30:28.843 --> 03:30:36.006]  The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contained ten of what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights.
[03:30:36.006 --> 03:30:38.667]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[03:30:38.667 --> 03:30:41.508]  It doesn't recognize color, or class, or wealth.
[03:30:41.508 --> 03:30:48.091]  It protects not just the rights of actors, or editors, or reporters, but extends even to those we love to hate.
[03:30:48.091 --> 03:30:51.032]  This is a small excerpt from Tralton Heston.
[03:30:51.032 --> 03:30:55.033]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years?
[03:30:56.474 --> 03:30:59.757]  And still maintain its nutrition and flavor.
[03:30:59.757 --> 03:31:00.298]  That's right.
[03:31:00.298 --> 03:31:05.562]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rites freeze dryers.
[03:31:05.562 --> 03:31:12.248]  Go to Infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use.
[03:31:12.248 --> 03:31:19.495]  And let me tell you something, it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[03:31:19.855 --> 03:31:20.055]  Woo!
[03:31:20.055 --> 03:31:21.096]  That's what I'm talking about.
[03:31:21.096 --> 03:31:29.842]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[03:31:29.842 --> 03:31:39.429]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[03:31:39.429 --> 03:31:42.871]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[03:31:42.871 --> 03:31:46.994]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[03:31:46.994 --> 03:31:47.835]  So what are you waiting for?
[03:31:48.055 --> 03:31:51.137]  Check it out right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:31:51.137 --> 03:32:01.742]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:32:01.742 --> 03:32:03.583]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[03:32:03.783 --> 03:32:06.664]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:32:06.664 --> 03:32:08.145]  It's made in the USA.
[03:32:08.145 --> 03:32:14.969]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body, and it supports the Enfloar.
[03:32:14.969 --> 03:32:17.050]  It is a classical 360 win.
[03:32:17.050 --> 03:32:26.754]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:32:26.754 --> 03:32:31.517]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[03:32:31.857 --> 03:32:43.560]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:32:43.560 --> 03:32:46.861]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[03:32:46.861 --> 03:32:50.002]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at Infowarslife.com.
[03:33:00.330 --> 03:33:07.014]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[03:33:07.014 --> 03:33:08.815]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:08.815 --> 03:33:13.298]  You know, folks say they want to see us take action against the globalists and expand their face.
[03:33:13.298 --> 03:33:13.758]  Well, we're doing it.
[03:33:13.758 --> 03:33:17.080]  Now you got every night, weekdays, big commitment, 8 a.m.
[03:33:18.433 --> 03:33:26.060]  We're going to take a few more calls.
[03:33:26.060 --> 03:33:27.741]  I'm going to hand the baton over to David.
[03:33:27.741 --> 03:33:31.804]  We're going to play a clip of the people chanting death to America last night.
[03:33:31.804 --> 03:33:32.765]  You can laugh at these people.
[03:33:32.765 --> 03:33:34.907]  Remember, they're globalist funded.
[03:33:34.907 --> 03:33:38.590]  They mean business and they've got control of your kids and the schools.
[03:33:38.590 --> 03:33:41.573]  We've got to pull out from these vampires.
[03:33:41.573 --> 03:33:44.996]  Scum of the earth here in this spoiled rotten nation just totally pissed.
[03:33:46.069 --> 03:33:49.631]  We are going to have to end the BuzzFeed special tomorrow.
[03:33:49.631 --> 03:33:56.576]  I'd said I could probably run it through the month, but we're selling out a lot of our best-selling products like RainForce, the Great Nootropic, at 55% off.
[03:33:56.576 --> 03:33:59.658]  DNA Force is going to sell out, still 20% off.
[03:33:59.658 --> 03:34:01.560]  Silver Bullet, 66% off.
[03:34:01.560 --> 03:34:04.522]  You sign up for AutoShip, it's way beyond a loss leader.
[03:34:04.522 --> 03:34:07.844]  AutoShip, sign up for AutoShip, you get an additional 10% off.
[03:34:07.844 --> 03:34:09.605]  Cancel anytime, Knockout, our amazing
[03:34:10.646 --> 03:34:18.580]  Neutropic for helping you sleep with nine different key compounds from melatonin to L-tryptophan to valerian root to lemon balm and chamomile concentrate.
[03:34:18.580 --> 03:34:21.205]  Knockout is selling out and it's 50% off still!
[03:34:22.168 --> 03:34:23.769]  Michael ZX sold out.
[03:34:23.769 --> 03:34:24.909]  Some other products sold out.
[03:34:24.909 --> 03:34:27.331]  Secret 12, our great B12 that's rated.
[03:34:27.331 --> 03:34:32.313]  Even BuzzFeed tried to shoot it down and said it was totally clean and listed it and rated it the top vitamin B12.
[03:34:32.313 --> 03:34:36.175]  They showed another one and said, this is the top one.
[03:34:36.175 --> 03:34:37.556]  Here, this is Jones's.
[03:34:37.556 --> 03:34:41.238]  Didn't tell you the one they said was the top one is people who are private labeling.
[03:34:41.238 --> 03:34:42.819]  How could you even make that?
[03:34:42.819 --> 03:34:45.761]  I mean, that's, that may be intentional sabotage.
[03:34:45.761 --> 03:34:47.842]  Maybe Charlie Wurzel really is on our team.
[03:34:48.702 --> 03:34:54.226]  Uh, he never told me that in person or anything, but I don't want to get him in trouble over BuzzFeed, but... Checks to the mail there, Charlie.
[03:34:54.226 --> 03:34:55.907]  Uh, continuing BioTruth Selenium.
[03:34:56.854 --> 03:34:59.656]  We've got to end the M4, select high-quality squirrel foods.
[03:34:59.656 --> 03:35:00.736]  50% off, never did that.
[03:35:00.736 --> 03:35:01.737]  That's ending the day.
[03:35:01.737 --> 03:35:03.618]  Code word, Goblin, to get that.
[03:35:03.618 --> 03:35:05.699]  New Super Blue mouthwash, it's discounted.
[03:35:05.699 --> 03:35:07.981]  Caveman chocolate and strawberries in.
[03:35:07.981 --> 03:35:09.422]  30% off Alexa Pure water filters.
[03:35:09.422 --> 03:35:11.103]  Cannot beat the deals normally.
[03:35:11.103 --> 03:35:14.224]  But at 25% off, at $147, it's unbelievable.
[03:35:14.224 --> 03:35:15.525]  Same thing with Alexa Pure Breeze.
[03:35:15.525 --> 03:35:19.207]  Air filtration, five stage, including carbon filter, ion, you name it.
[03:35:19.207 --> 03:35:20.288]  Comparable systems for $400 to $800.
[03:35:20.288 --> 03:35:20.588]  Used to be $1,000.
[03:35:20.588 --> 03:35:21.829]  Prices are going down.
[03:35:24.010 --> 03:35:25.430]  At $250,000 this used to be a deal.
[03:35:25.430 --> 03:35:28.051]  Then we did it at $220,000.
[03:35:28.051 --> 03:35:28.711]  Now $149,000.
[03:35:28.711 --> 03:35:28.831]  $96,000.
[03:35:28.831 --> 03:35:30.011]  Vitamin Refusion 33% off.
[03:35:30.011 --> 03:35:34.232]  We'll have a few new specials tomorrow that are going to be great.
[03:35:34.232 --> 03:35:38.773]  But the big mega specials the last month and a half are going to come to an end.
[03:35:38.773 --> 03:35:44.834]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:35:44.834 --> 03:35:47.815]  I want to go to Kevin, Jason, and Barb right now.
[03:35:47.815 --> 03:35:49.595]  And then David, tell folks what you've got coming up.
[03:35:49.975 --> 03:35:56.661]  Well, Alex, I want to talk about what happened with the USS McCain, because this is not just the second collision in two months.
[03:35:56.661 --> 03:35:59.563]  There have been four this year in the Navy.
[03:35:59.563 --> 03:36:10.333]  And we need to take a look at what's going on with this, especially when we have President Trump having a speech tonight telling us what the strategy is going to be in Afghanistan.
[03:36:10.333 --> 03:36:15.477]  And understand the difference between increasing the troops and having a strategy.
[03:36:15.477 --> 03:36:17.359]  Adding more troops is a tactic.
[03:36:17.839 --> 03:36:18.679]  But what does it mean?
[03:36:18.679 --> 03:36:19.439]  What are we going to do?
[03:36:19.439 --> 03:36:21.560]  What is the goal in Afghanistan?
[03:36:21.560 --> 03:36:22.820]  That's what we need to hear tonight.
[03:36:22.820 --> 03:36:25.081]  Did the generals tell them what the goal is?
[03:36:25.081 --> 03:36:27.882]  Because we have been there for 16 years.
[03:36:27.882 --> 03:36:29.522]  What is the end game here?
[03:36:29.522 --> 03:36:31.283]  How do we know when we have won?
[03:36:31.283 --> 03:36:32.643]  That is the strategy.
[03:36:32.643 --> 03:36:35.564]  By the way, for those who don't know, the GPS and stuff they've got now,
[03:36:36.164 --> 03:36:41.348]  For them to, they're supposed to stay 50 miles generally away from any main shipping lane, that's just a tactic.
[03:36:41.348 --> 03:36:45.351]  I should ask Posobiec about this, because he's in Naval, I guess he can't talk about it because he's in Naval Intelligence.
[03:36:45.351 --> 03:36:49.794]  They believe the Chinese or somebody is hacking in to the GPS software.
[03:36:49.794 --> 03:36:55.038]  There's no way that two of these, you know, ships that cost almost a billion dollars apiece have now been ramped.
[03:36:55.038 --> 03:36:59.161]  It's just, they're being turned off.
[03:36:59.161 --> 03:36:59.842]  What do you make of this?
[03:37:00.845 --> 03:37:04.529]  Well, I don't know, that's... Isn't it funny it's John McCain?
[03:37:04.529 --> 03:37:08.473]  Yeah, I know, there's some jokes that could be made there, but right now it's a tragedy.
[03:37:08.473 --> 03:37:15.340]  We have five people injured, ten people missing from that ship, and presumed dead because... I'm telling you, this is cyber warfare.
[03:37:15.340 --> 03:37:16.621]  And so, that is the question.
[03:37:16.621 --> 03:37:22.527]  They need people, it shows how most pilots they say don't know how to land a plane anymore, and when there's bad weather they don't know what to do.
[03:37:22.827 --> 03:37:23.007]  Yeah.
[03:37:23.007 --> 03:37:27.691]  That's why these landings are so much better than I was a kid, because it's a damn computer doing it, excuse me.
[03:37:27.691 --> 03:37:28.031]  That's right.
[03:37:28.031 --> 03:37:33.035]  And what's happening here is, what happens when the GPS goes out, or what happens?
[03:37:33.035 --> 03:37:38.580]  Well, they need to have people with spotlights out there all night long on a ship watching.
[03:37:38.580 --> 03:37:40.662]  You don't just go off the radar or the GPS.
[03:37:40.862 --> 03:37:42.283]  But it's even more complicated than that.
[03:37:42.283 --> 03:37:59.698]  As this guy pointed out in USA Today, and he is a former naval officer, he says we've had these four major incidents and he said it's not just that you've got people in the Combat Information Center where they have no windows and they're reliant on their machines, but they also do have people who are looking out.
[03:37:59.698 --> 03:38:01.179]  They have people on the bridge of the destroyer.
[03:38:01.179 --> 03:38:03.041]  There's five watchstanders.
[03:38:03.041 --> 03:38:06.964]  Then they have people who are lookouts, one forward and one in the rear.
[03:38:06.964 --> 03:38:09.086]  So why are those people not seeing it?
[03:38:09.266 --> 03:38:11.627]  Perhaps it was difficult weather conditions.
[03:38:11.627 --> 03:38:16.148]  Perhaps it was at night and maybe the visual spotters could not see it.
[03:38:16.148 --> 03:38:20.410]  And what you're talking about there in terms of the GPS being hacked, that's a big issue.
[03:38:20.410 --> 03:38:23.391]  But we've also had a lot of failures with military equipment.
[03:38:23.391 --> 03:38:27.292]  We've had these littoral ships, which are the ships that operate in shallow waters.
[03:38:27.292 --> 03:38:28.392]  We had a $360 million ship
[03:38:31.113 --> 03:38:36.595]  And after being out for 20 days and had to be towed back, they didn't have a backup power supply.
[03:38:36.595 --> 03:38:50.280]  So when the main engines went... And that's like when Trump points out, we need to stop going with these, he points out, for 20 years they've been trying to make these new electrical-powered, not gas-powered, air-powered launch cables for the jets.
[03:38:50.280 --> 03:38:52.941]  And he says, just get rid of it, because the military told him it's pure crap.
[03:38:52.941 --> 03:38:54.101]  Get rid of it!
[03:38:54.101 --> 03:38:55.441]  Go back to what works.
[03:38:55.441 --> 03:38:56.442]  Advance with what works.
[03:38:57.302 --> 03:38:58.423]  Go back with what works.
[03:38:58.423 --> 03:38:58.964]  It's just crazy.
[03:38:58.964 --> 03:39:00.986]  Kevin... He was doing it with the Air Force One, too, yeah.
[03:39:00.986 --> 03:39:01.747]  Exactly.
[03:39:01.747 --> 03:39:03.870]  Oh, and then the Russian airliner goes bankrupt.
[03:39:03.870 --> 03:39:05.892]  They never use the two jumbo jets.
[03:39:05.892 --> 03:39:11.398]  The military, the Air Force, says buy them back, because Trump doesn't want to spend money, and they spend it like, oh, see?
[03:39:11.398 --> 03:39:12.219]  Russians!
[03:39:12.219 --> 03:39:12.880]  Russians!
[03:39:12.880 --> 03:39:14.462]  It's just crazy, folks.
[03:39:14.462 --> 03:39:15.443]  Kevin in Florida.
[03:39:15.443 --> 03:39:16.003]  You're on the air.
[03:39:16.003 --> 03:39:16.344]  Go ahead.
[03:39:18.735 --> 03:39:19.895]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[03:39:19.895 --> 03:39:21.936]  I'm a longtime listener.
[03:39:21.936 --> 03:39:32.840]  I just want to say, with our current climate, I mean, we keep on saying it, but I feel like we're so razor thin close to a civil war because the informed Americans
[03:39:33.781 --> 03:39:38.403]  Uh, aren't playing by the same set of rules that are allowed from the leftist scum.
[03:39:38.403 --> 03:39:51.510]  I mean, the decks are stacked against us, and we're fighting up a battle, and we're trying not to use violence, and we're trying to use information, but the thing that people gotta understand, these leftists, they don't wanna hear that.
[03:39:51.510 --> 03:39:52.110]  They don't care.
[03:39:52.110 --> 03:39:54.051]  They're gonna do what they wanna do.
[03:39:54.051 --> 03:39:57.253]  They're gonna push the agenda that is paying their bill.
[03:39:57.253 --> 03:39:59.434]  Um, so I don't see any other route.
[03:40:02.145 --> 03:40:02.606]  Good point.
[03:40:02.606 --> 03:40:04.568]  You know, here's an example.
[03:40:04.568 --> 03:40:05.529]  And we know it was them.
[03:40:05.529 --> 03:40:11.336]  The newspaper went and created from our intel a Craigslist ad saying we need actors to come protest the Lenin statue.
[03:40:11.336 --> 03:40:13.619]  Well, I never went to the Lenin statue in Seattle.
[03:40:13.619 --> 03:40:18.565]  I don't ever hire actors for anything unless it's like for a Craigslist ad or some modeling agency to have, you know, a...
[03:40:19.654 --> 03:40:24.038]  Girl, rub suntan lotion on her, or God, get a poor caveman and a cup and stir it.
[03:40:24.038 --> 03:40:27.181]  I mean, this is real, there's no teleprompters, there's no actors.
[03:40:27.181 --> 03:40:34.508]  They just ran the fake news thing in newspapers that I was staging things, that the guy that attacked me was an actor, because he is an actor.
[03:40:34.508 --> 03:40:36.370]  But every one of those losers is an actor.
[03:40:36.370 --> 03:40:39.093]  They're all little delicate geniuses, okay?
[03:40:39.093 --> 03:40:40.914]  And you know, so again...
[03:40:42.151 --> 03:40:46.035]  And they even put out fake Craigslist with Mikael Thelen's name on it.
[03:40:46.035 --> 03:40:49.699]  So they think we're doing these fake tactics to beat them.
[03:40:49.699 --> 03:40:52.683]  They go claim that we're making it up that they're fake.
[03:40:52.683 --> 03:40:57.067]  Then they go out and fake stuff, trying to make it look like we're fake, doubling down that they're the ones that are fake.
[03:40:57.628 --> 03:40:58.448]  Does that make sense?
[03:40:58.448 --> 03:40:58.928]  Yeah.
[03:40:58.928 --> 03:41:01.429]  And it doesn't cost anything to run a Craigslist ad.
[03:41:01.429 --> 03:41:04.409]  You know, you can look and see who the writers are and you can put a Craigslist ad.
[03:41:04.409 --> 03:41:07.730]  Yeah, we didn't just go off the Craigslist ad for Charlottesville or other areas.
[03:41:07.730 --> 03:41:09.771]  This company's been around since 2007.
[03:41:09.771 --> 03:41:11.311]  They're the ones that did Hillary's ads.
[03:41:11.311 --> 03:41:14.992]  There's been Politico articles where they're interviewed, New York Times articles.
[03:41:14.992 --> 03:41:17.672]  This is a real group hiring people for anti-fuck.
[03:41:17.672 --> 03:41:17.912]  Yeah.
[03:41:17.912 --> 03:41:19.453]  I mean, we have them advertising.
[03:41:19.453 --> 03:41:21.913]  We have a 10-year track record.
[03:41:21.913 --> 03:41:22.233]  Right.
[03:41:22.233 --> 03:41:23.594]  We're not just saying they did this.
[03:41:23.594 --> 03:41:24.654]  We have proof.
[03:41:24.654 --> 03:41:24.774]  Yeah.
[03:41:25.578 --> 03:41:27.619]  But see, the media goes, how do we counter Jones?
[03:41:27.619 --> 03:41:28.699]  Well, he says we're actors.
[03:41:28.699 --> 03:41:31.640]  We'll just put out fake stuff saying he's hiring actors.
[03:41:31.640 --> 03:41:32.420]  Well, that's what they do.
[03:41:32.420 --> 03:41:33.321]  They project onto you.
[03:41:33.321 --> 03:41:35.862]  And that's what Hillary Clinton did with the Russian issue, right?
[03:41:35.862 --> 03:41:37.482]  She's got all these Russian issues.
[03:41:37.482 --> 03:41:41.544]  She's got all of these issues with national security violations.
[03:41:41.544 --> 03:41:42.524]  And so what does she do?
[03:41:42.524 --> 03:41:44.925]  She projects all that onto Donald Trump.
[03:41:45.425 --> 03:41:54.327]  So it inoculates her against that, and of course we've got the... Exactly, because wait, she's the one fighting the Russia stuff, but when it's her in bed with it, and the indictments are coming, great point Kevin.
[03:41:54.327 --> 03:41:56.968]  Jason in Canada, dun-dun-dun-dun, you're on the air.
[03:41:56.968 --> 03:42:00.089]  Hi Alex.
[03:42:00.089 --> 03:42:04.130]  I've been listening since June 2016.
[03:42:04.130 --> 03:42:14.012]  I really like your show, and I just want to say first off that your show is the reason why I got me and my family off the tap water, and I opted my
[03:42:15.205 --> 03:42:17.067]  Beautiful, smart daughter.
[03:42:17.067 --> 03:42:18.849]  12 years old.
[03:42:18.849 --> 03:42:22.913]  They wanted to give her a three-pronged concoction.
[03:42:22.913 --> 03:42:25.896]  I opted out of it.
[03:42:25.896 --> 03:42:26.737]  And I thank you for that.
[03:42:28.865 --> 03:42:29.826]  Well, thank you, brother.
[03:42:29.826 --> 03:42:35.990]  I mean, the tap water is so full of 300, 400 poisons on average, the number one thing anybody can do is purify their water.
[03:42:35.990 --> 03:42:38.111]  They act like that's kooky and weird.
[03:42:38.111 --> 03:42:41.013]  And they go, he's selling money, selling filters.
[03:42:41.013 --> 03:42:42.054]  Exactly.
[03:42:42.054 --> 03:42:44.676]  We sell things we believe in and use.
[03:42:44.676 --> 03:42:46.077]  That's how it's supposed to work.
[03:42:46.457 --> 03:42:55.389]  Yeah, you look at things like Flint, Michigan, or the situation in California where they dumped that carcinogen into the groundwater there.
[03:42:55.389 --> 03:43:02.419]  Wouldn't you like to not find out after the fact that you and your family have been drinking this stuff that it should have filtered out?
[03:43:02.879 --> 03:43:06.042]  Most well water and most tap water taste like total crap.
[03:43:06.042 --> 03:43:06.442]  Yeah.
[03:43:06.442 --> 03:43:08.965]  There are some aquifer wells that taste completely awesome.
[03:43:08.965 --> 03:43:15.931]  I used to have a farmhouse and an aquifer well and then I got divorced and my ex-wife cut it all, but the point is that that doesn't matter.
[03:43:15.931 --> 03:43:17.732]  That was good well water and you could taste it.
[03:43:17.732 --> 03:43:18.233]  It was great.
[03:43:18.233 --> 03:43:21.175]  We even had it tested and it was pretty clean.
[03:43:21.175 --> 03:43:26.200]  But compared to what you get with a Pro-Pure or an Alexa Pure that cut stuff down to
[03:43:26.340 --> 03:43:26.941]  Are you still there?
[03:43:26.941 --> 03:43:27.461]  Yes I am, go ahead.
[03:43:47.259 --> 03:43:49.101]  Okay, I grew up on well water.
[03:43:49.101 --> 03:44:02.571]  I was in a rural area when I grew up and then they Came to our public schools all the kids in the farm areas With like a four ride that they would have us Put a half cup in our mouth and swish it around go up and down the hall when we got back.
[03:44:02.571 --> 03:44:15.341]  We spit it out into the end to the Town So they got us to the floor that way I remember getting sick those little pills you suck on your mouth red pills you get real sick off of them Yeah, yeah
[03:44:15.973 --> 03:44:18.414]  Well, I remember getting a really bad headache.
[03:44:18.414 --> 03:44:21.156]  Just looking back now, I wonder if that was the cause.
[03:44:21.156 --> 03:44:32.581]  I can't get the timeline, but I remember at one time, I was around the same time, I accidentally swallowed some of it one time, like in grade three, and I got this massive migraine headache.
[03:44:32.581 --> 03:44:42.866]  Well, it says on the insert of toothpaste, don't swallow it, and you only use a pea-sized amount, and if you do use more than that, call poison control immediately.
[03:44:43.166 --> 03:44:50.309]  Well, look, Harvard and other people have done studies to correlate a decrease in IQ to fluoride consumption at certain levels.
[03:44:50.309 --> 03:44:57.371]  But the question is this, how do you know if they dump it into the water supply what level of fluoride you're getting?
[03:44:57.371 --> 03:45:03.133]  You don't know if you're getting more than... It's like saying you drink sunscreen to not get burned by the sun.
[03:45:03.954 --> 03:45:11.981]  Exactly, but why would you, even if it's something this good, why would you dump it in the water supply because you have no control over the dosage?
[03:45:11.981 --> 03:45:15.444]  A child is going to get the same dosage as an adult male?
[03:45:15.444 --> 03:45:19.507]  Yeah, well the Harvard study said 1.6 parts per million, which is what the US standard.
[03:45:20.308 --> 03:45:27.170]  Reduced IQs on average more than 10 points after just several years of use in a prepubescent child.
[03:45:27.170 --> 03:45:27.910]  Yeah.
[03:45:27.910 --> 03:45:31.111]  And an eight-fold increase in bone cancers in boys.
[03:45:31.111 --> 03:45:35.252]  And it's just a big laundry list because they're not using calcium fluoride.
[03:45:35.252 --> 03:45:36.452]  You're an engineer, you know this.
[03:45:36.452 --> 03:45:48.475]  They're using hydrofluorosilicic acid, which is an electrified, you know, I'm not the chemist like you, but they basically add more stuff onto it, a charge, and then it makes it way more bioavailable and makes it an adjuvant, basically.
[03:45:48.635 --> 03:45:49.635]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[03:45:49.635 --> 03:45:51.856]  And irritant, like they do in the vaccines.
[03:45:51.856 --> 03:45:54.757]  So, yeah, none of it makes any sense.
[03:45:54.757 --> 03:45:57.719]  And so you have to take control of your own life.
[03:45:57.719 --> 03:46:00.300]  And that's one of the things that we can do, fortunately, right now.
[03:46:00.300 --> 03:46:01.940]  We can take control of our life.
[03:46:01.940 --> 03:46:05.782]  I wish it was that easy to filter out the Federal Reserve and the federal government.
[03:46:05.782 --> 03:46:06.122]  Exactly.
[03:46:06.122 --> 03:46:08.163]  I wish I could buy a can to do that, but I can't.
[03:46:08.163 --> 03:46:09.043]  Jason, great points.
[03:46:09.043 --> 03:46:12.764]  Barb in Illinois, last caller, and then we're going to play this clip, and David's going to take over and finish up.
[03:46:12.764 --> 03:46:14.185]  Go ahead, Barb.
[03:46:14.185 --> 03:46:15.125]  Hi, Alex.
[03:46:15.125 --> 03:46:16.066]  Hi, Alex, can you hear me?
[03:46:16.066 --> 03:46:16.346]  Yes, ma'am.
[03:46:17.046 --> 03:46:19.028]  I just want to say I respect everything you're doing.
[03:46:19.028 --> 03:46:21.190]  I followed you all through Seattle this weekend.
[03:46:21.190 --> 03:46:28.497]  The reason I'm calling is because you've been talking about, well anyway, it's about
[03:46:29.292 --> 03:46:38.616]  Scott Bale yesterday tweeted out that today, he says, beware what's happening today, and he showed a video of Douglas Dukat Sr., a U.S.
[03:46:38.616 --> 03:46:47.380]  Army retired CEO of Veterans United for Justice, saying that the senators were going to pass a vote on censoring President Trump.
[03:46:47.380 --> 03:46:49.021]  Have you heard anything?
[03:46:49.021 --> 03:46:50.382]  Censoring or censuring?
[03:46:51.192 --> 03:46:52.333]  Censuring.
[03:46:52.333 --> 03:46:53.014]  S-U-R.
[03:46:53.014 --> 03:46:55.356]  Guys, search engine censuring.
[03:46:55.356 --> 03:46:56.317]  Censure.
[03:46:56.317 --> 03:46:57.278]  Censure of Trump.
[03:46:57.278 --> 03:46:58.660]  Put that into the search engine.
[03:46:58.660 --> 03:46:59.521]  I've not heard of that.
[03:46:59.521 --> 03:47:13.054]  But I know there's all sorts of horrid Republican senators and Democrats together going to grandstand and build towards their impeachment case as Trump desperately tries to turn the economy back on.
[03:47:13.054 --> 03:47:14.356]  What did you know about it, Barb?
[03:47:15.314 --> 03:47:27.216]  I found out, I saw the tweet last night, I was so mad, I started calling all these Senators last night, leaving messages, but there's eight of them, they're supposed to be turning and voting with the Democrats.
[03:47:27.216 --> 03:47:31.517]  Yeah, there it is, it's, uh, are leading a fight to censure Trump.
[03:47:31.517 --> 03:47:37.358]  So the Democrats are pushing that, they're pushing, they've got some Republicans involved, they've got impeachment talk going as well.
[03:47:37.358 --> 03:47:43.619]  Yeah, censure him for racism when he's done no such thing, and the Democrats are led by a literal Nazi collaborator, Barb.
[03:47:44.827 --> 03:47:52.970]  Because of what he said after the Charlottesville thing, both sides being wrong, which he was correct at saying.
[03:47:52.970 --> 03:48:06.294]  Well, he's seen that from the campaign rallies that he had, when they had a permit for a rally, they had a political rally, they weren't hurting anybody, and the left shows up, gets violent, starts destroying property, starts attacking the police.
[03:48:06.294 --> 03:48:09.035]  This has gone on through the entire- Look, we got all the studies.
[03:48:09.035 --> 03:48:10.396]  Modern liberals are criminals.
[03:48:10.976 --> 03:48:13.517]  They're mentally ill, they're criminals, they steal.
[03:48:13.517 --> 03:48:15.398]  We keep asking, what's wrong with them?
[03:48:15.398 --> 03:48:18.419]  They're part of the collapse of civilization.
[03:48:18.419 --> 03:48:27.183]  Barb, we're going to go out to break with this clip of the statues being taken down last night by people that didn't even know what statues they were at UT and screaming, Death to America!
[03:48:27.183 --> 03:48:28.263]  Our own Owen Shroyer covering it.
[03:48:28.263 --> 03:48:30.284]  And then David Knight's going to come back with closing comments.
[03:48:30.284 --> 03:48:32.645]  And then he'll be back tomorrow morning, Lord willing, 8 a.m.
[03:48:32.645 --> 03:48:33.605]  Central.
[03:48:33.605 --> 03:48:34.646]  But let's go ahead and go to this piece.
[03:48:35.560 --> 03:48:38.562]  That's why you're here, to bring up Mike Brown.
[03:48:38.562 --> 03:48:41.224]  It has nothing to do with this at all.
[03:48:41.224 --> 03:48:47.249]  You're out here saying it's a white supremacy country as you preach free speech in the streets.
[03:48:47.249 --> 03:48:49.651]  My man, I don't have any men, so I don't know what you're talking about.
[03:48:49.651 --> 03:48:50.672]  Everyone here is American.
[03:48:50.672 --> 03:48:51.672]  Y'all are my men.
[03:48:51.672 --> 03:48:53.173]  We should all be able to get along.
[03:48:53.173 --> 03:48:53.594]  I'm not.
[03:48:53.594 --> 03:48:54.795]  Okay, you're not my man.
[03:48:54.795 --> 03:48:56.776]  Do you hate America?
[03:48:56.776 --> 03:48:58.878]  You hate America?
[03:48:58.878 --> 03:48:59.718]  Say that again.
[03:48:59.718 --> 03:49:01.079]  Death to America.
[03:49:01.079 --> 03:49:01.280]  Wow.
[03:49:02.521 --> 03:49:03.722]  Wow.
[03:49:03.722 --> 03:49:08.168]  Death to the greatest country in the history of the world.
[03:49:08.168 --> 03:49:08.789]  Really?
[03:49:08.789 --> 03:49:13.134]  Tell me a country that's had a higher standard of living than the American way of life.
[03:49:13.134 --> 03:49:13.695]  Switzerland.
[03:49:13.695 --> 03:49:14.956]  Do you know about Switzerland?
[03:49:14.956 --> 03:49:16.378]  Okay, what about Switzerland?
[03:49:16.378 --> 03:49:17.660]  Why are they so wealthy?
[03:49:21.769 --> 03:49:22.510]  I don't know.
[03:49:22.510 --> 03:49:23.170]  Banking?
[03:49:23.170 --> 03:49:23.771]  You don't know.
[03:49:23.771 --> 03:49:25.612]  You seem to know a lot, but you seem not to know anything.
[03:49:25.612 --> 03:49:29.335]  I'm literally, it's a f***ing euphemism.
[03:49:29.335 --> 03:49:29.715]  I don't know.
[03:49:29.715 --> 03:49:32.637]  F***ing imperialism, f***ing like the colonization of Afghans.
[03:49:32.637 --> 03:49:35.059]  Probably white nationalism too, right?
[03:49:35.059 --> 03:49:36.560]  No, not white nationalism.
[03:49:36.560 --> 03:49:39.723]  Do you know it's like impossible to become a citizen of Switzerland?
[03:49:39.723 --> 03:49:40.183]  Why is that?
[03:49:40.183 --> 03:49:41.764]  It's one of the most conservative nation states.
[03:49:41.764 --> 03:49:43.266]  It's pretty damn hard to become a citizen here.
[03:49:43.266 --> 03:49:44.486]  They hoard guns.
[03:49:44.486 --> 03:49:44.767]  Oh really?
[03:49:44.767 --> 03:49:46.768]  You can walk right across the border actually.
[03:49:46.768 --> 03:49:48.069]  Now the new president's changing.
[03:49:49.891 --> 03:49:52.432]  Yeah, you're above the law, actually.
[03:49:52.432 --> 03:49:54.154]  You're above the law, really?
[03:49:54.154 --> 03:49:55.875]  So you guys hate America.
[03:49:55.875 --> 03:49:58.137]  You guys hate America, the greatest country on Earth.
[03:49:58.137 --> 03:49:59.678]  Everyone in the world wishes they could live here.
[03:49:59.678 --> 03:50:00.999]  You understand that?
[03:50:00.999 --> 03:50:01.759]  Wow.
[03:50:01.759 --> 03:50:06.043]  What you're listening to is Owen Schroer at the University of Texas here in Austin.
[03:50:06.043 --> 03:50:07.584]  They want to take down a statue of Robert E. Lee.
[03:50:08.124 --> 03:50:10.686]  They don't know what they're destroying.
[03:50:10.686 --> 03:50:22.515]  And the key thing is that we have people like this that are now able to get to the point where they are removing the symbols, purging the symbols of our country, and that's not where they're going to stop.
[03:50:22.515 --> 03:50:26.438]  They want to get rid of our borders, our economy, our laws, our culture, our history.
[03:50:27.279 --> 03:50:30.741]  This is a part of destroying America as a nation.
[03:50:30.741 --> 03:50:40.545]  And as ridiculous and as stupid as these people are, you have to be concerned about the fact that they're actually accomplishing what they wanted to do.
[03:50:40.545 --> 03:50:43.947]  That is, I think, the scariest thing that we see out there.
[03:50:43.947 --> 03:50:48.028]  And there's many different dimensions to this, and of course it's been going on for a while.
[03:50:48.028 --> 03:50:53.351]  Who would have thought that we would get to this level of insanity, of inanity?
[03:50:53.891 --> 03:50:55.032]  If you want to put it that way.
[03:50:55.032 --> 03:51:00.958]  I mean, this is idiocracy, as Mike Judge has put it out there, but it's idiocracy with violence.
[03:51:00.958 --> 03:51:06.343]  We have seen this happen in country after country as part of the plan.
[03:51:06.343 --> 03:51:09.926]  And of course, Bill Ayers and the Weathermen, what did they do at the very beginning?
[03:51:10.066 --> 03:51:20.918]  They were the ones who started floating this idea that is indoctrinated into all of our children throughout their K-12 education, the idea of white privilege.
[03:51:20.918 --> 03:51:23.241]  They called it white skin privilege.
[03:51:23.241 --> 03:51:25.383]  That was Bill Ayers talking about that again.
[03:51:26.184 --> 03:51:38.814]  Focusing on racial divisions in America because they knew they had already tried to do it along economic class lines that had been successful in Europe, but it was not successful in America.
[03:51:38.814 --> 03:51:40.916]  So that was where they were going.
[03:51:40.916 --> 03:51:43.938]  Now I want to go back to the specials that we have here.
[03:51:45.057 --> 03:51:49.318]  Of course, this is going to be ending very soon, so take advantage of these specials.
[03:51:49.318 --> 03:51:52.939]  These are the things that allow us to expand our operation.
[03:51:52.939 --> 03:51:56.721]  We had a new program start this morning, Real News.
[03:51:56.721 --> 03:51:58.981]  I'm hosting that from 8 to 11 Central Time.
[03:51:58.981 --> 03:51:59.882]  That's 9 to 12 Eastern Time.
[03:52:01.642 --> 03:52:10.767]  And it's your support that allows us to proceed with these new programs, to grow, to expand, to cover larger sections of time with Real News.
[03:52:10.767 --> 03:52:17.291]  And so we have this special 1776, a great number of items that are there, 55% off Brain Force, 55% off of
[03:52:21.530 --> 03:52:27.873]  Let's see, Survival Shield X2, Nascent Iodine, Secret 12, Vitamin B12, all three of those, 55% off.
[03:52:27.873 --> 03:52:29.614]  Knockout, 50% off.
[03:52:29.614 --> 03:52:31.756]  Silver Bullet, 66% off.
[03:52:31.756 --> 03:52:34.157]  That's why the sale is going to have to end.
[03:52:34.157 --> 03:52:40.961]  We are selling out of product and we have to reserve some of this for those people who have signed up for AutoShip.
[03:52:41.701 --> 03:52:46.705]  Also, free shipping, and this is the last day, so make sure you sign up for that.
[03:52:46.705 --> 03:52:47.486]  We want to help you.
[03:52:47.486 --> 03:52:49.448]  We want to let you try these products.
[03:52:49.448 --> 03:52:53.591]  If you've never tried some of these products, now is a great time to try this.
[03:52:53.591 --> 03:52:55.553]  See how effective these products are.
[03:52:55.553 --> 03:53:00.577]  High quality products that we sell here at InfoWars, and we do thank you for your support.
[03:53:00.577 --> 03:53:05.342]  I want to get back to this story about USS McCain, because tonight we're going to have Donald Trump
[03:53:05.982 --> 03:53:14.085]  Selling the country on the plan that was put together by the generals at Camp David on Friday, the day that they got rid of Steve Bannon.
[03:53:14.085 --> 03:53:22.348]  As you heard Jack Posobiec say, Steve Bannon was going to present a different approach, approach that coincided with what
[03:53:24.002 --> 03:53:29.327]  What Donald Trump ran on when he ran for president, the agenda that he wanted to do to put basically America first.
[03:53:29.327 --> 03:53:33.230]  To not get us tied into a forever war.
[03:53:33.230 --> 03:53:35.132]  He was not allowed to present that plan.
[03:53:35.132 --> 03:53:36.252]  He was removed.
[03:53:36.252 --> 03:53:38.454]  And the day that he was removed, they had this
[03:53:39.395 --> 03:53:40.076]  We're good to go.
[03:53:55.714 --> 03:53:59.079]  Well, what was Bannon's position there in the White House?
[03:53:59.079 --> 03:54:02.785]  Well, he was the White House chief strategist.
[03:54:02.785 --> 03:54:05.248]  He would have had something to say about this.
[03:54:05.248 --> 03:54:10.596]  And of course, he was removed by the generals, by McMaster, from the National Security Council as soon as McMaster
[03:54:11.317 --> 03:54:12.518]  Was put in there.
[03:54:12.518 --> 03:54:17.963]  And then he was removed from the Camp David meeting where they were going to talk about an Afghan strategy.
[03:54:17.963 --> 03:54:19.665]  And this is what Mattis said.
[03:54:19.665 --> 03:54:24.549]  He said Trump came in with a very different course of action.
[03:54:24.549 --> 03:54:31.115]  And I think he now needs the weekend to collect his thoughts about how he's going to explain it to the American people.
[03:54:31.115 --> 03:54:32.956]  We're going to hear that explanation tonight.
[03:54:33.820 --> 03:54:36.503]  And that's going to be at 9 o'clock Eastern Time.
[03:54:36.503 --> 03:54:38.485]  Donald Trump is going to go live.
[03:54:38.485 --> 03:54:43.070]  And so the troop increase, and don't let them fool you on this.
[03:54:43.070 --> 03:54:45.232]  I don't like to talk about tactics and strategies.
[03:54:45.232 --> 03:54:50.478]  Yes, yes, he is a major general, a very modern major general, if you know Gilbert and Sullivan.
[03:54:50.478 --> 03:54:54.302]  But look, let's understand the difference between a troop increase
[03:54:55.263 --> 03:54:59.824]  And a strategy that says, this is what winning looks like.
[03:54:59.824 --> 03:55:03.225]  Here's when we know we're done in Afghanistan.
[03:55:03.225 --> 03:55:08.647]  If you don't hear that tonight, you should be having warning bells going off.
[03:55:08.647 --> 03:55:12.428]  BS should be going off when you hear this plan.
[03:55:12.428 --> 03:55:15.189]  Because we need to know what their strategy is.
[03:55:15.189 --> 03:55:18.329]  We need to know how they define success.
[03:55:18.329 --> 03:55:21.570]  We need to know how long they're going to take to do this.
[03:55:21.570 --> 03:55:23.051]  That is the strategy.
[03:55:24.048 --> 03:55:30.752]  Increasing the troops by 4,000 or by whatever the number that they come up with, that is simply a tactic.
[03:55:30.752 --> 03:55:45.281]  And when we have this discussion tonight, I want you to keep in the back of your mind the tragedy that just happened again, just two months after we had a similar strategy, the USS McCain colliding with a merchant ship at sea.
[03:55:45.281 --> 03:55:49.724]  This is the fourth mishap this year at sea.
[03:55:49.724 --> 03:55:53.086]  And this is what the person who wrote about this in USA Today pointed out.
[03:55:54.011 --> 03:56:00.215]  As he said, there's a very high-tech, isolated control system that is in the Combat Information Center.
[03:56:00.215 --> 03:56:07.300]  There's no windows, you can't see obstacles, but there's several sailors, and they've got all these radar screens and military sensors and so forth.
[03:56:07.300 --> 03:56:09.281]  And, of course, that could be easily hacked.
[03:56:09.281 --> 03:56:18.628]  But then you also have, on the bridge of the destroyer, at least five watchstanders, and then you have additional people forward and aft of the ship.
[03:56:18.628 --> 03:56:23.070]  All of these systems failed, not just once, but twice, in two months.
[03:56:23.911 --> 03:56:24.592]  What is going on?
[03:56:24.592 --> 03:56:26.774]  Well, here's the consequences of this that he points out.
[03:56:26.774 --> 03:56:30.397]  He said, generally, when something like that happens, you look at the chain of command.
[03:56:30.397 --> 03:56:32.579]  Are these guys literally asleep at the wheel?
[03:56:32.579 --> 03:56:33.320]  What's going on?
[03:56:33.320 --> 03:56:42.488]  But he goes, this has a big effect, and when we see this many incidents, we know that this is not the problem of one commander.
[03:56:42.488 --> 03:56:44.350]  This is some kind of a systemic problem.
[03:56:44.830 --> 03:56:57.293]  And he points out, after this incident, we've now got 25% of the total force of Destroyer Squadron 15 now indefinitely out of commission during a period of heightened tensions between North Korea and the U.S.
[03:56:57.293 --> 03:57:06.236]  and its allies, and senseless deaths of sailors, and the indefinite loss of two $2 billion ships.
[03:57:07.932 --> 03:57:09.934]  This is what we're getting from the military.
[03:57:09.934 --> 03:57:11.416]  Are we getting our money's worth?
[03:57:11.416 --> 03:57:19.344]  Are we getting involved in wars that we have no plans of winning, that we have no strategy to finish?
[03:57:19.344 --> 03:57:21.446]  I think we are.
[03:57:21.446 --> 03:57:24.389]  And I think a key part of this goes back to H.R.
[03:57:24.389 --> 03:57:25.431]  McMaster, and I'll tell you why.
[03:57:26.360 --> 03:57:38.466]  He wrote a book called Dereliction of Duty, and that is now pretty much required or recommended reading for the Marine Corps, for many others in the military, and what it is is an after-action report of the Vietnam War.
[03:57:38.466 --> 03:57:46.469]  The central thesis of that, when he said the dereliction of duty, he believed the dereliction of duty wasn't so much a failure of civilian leadership.
[03:57:46.469 --> 03:57:54.293]  He said the civilians didn't know what they were doing, and the dereliction of duty was on the part of the military who didn't tell them what to do.
[03:57:55.393 --> 03:58:00.057]  I think McMaster and the other generals are telling Trump what to do.
[03:58:00.057 --> 03:58:04.421]  I think they told him to do something that he did not want to do.
[03:58:04.421 --> 03:58:07.263]  That he said was the wrong thing when he was running for president.
[03:58:07.263 --> 03:58:09.045]  That we agreed with him on.
[03:58:09.045 --> 03:58:11.106]  Said we don't want a forever war.
[03:58:11.106 --> 03:58:15.050]  So we want to watch this very carefully tonight to see what is happening.
[03:58:15.050 --> 03:58:19.013]  As Alex said, this may be the point at which things go sideways.
[03:58:19.013 --> 03:58:20.814]  We're going to watch this very carefully.
[03:58:20.814 --> 03:58:23.457]  Support Trump by supporting his agenda.
[03:58:23.957 --> 03:58:24.999]  That's it for this broadcast.
[03:58:24.999 --> 03:58:32.709]  Join us again tomorrow, 8 o'clock AM, for The Real News with David Dunn.
[03:58:32.709 --> 03:58:36.674]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
