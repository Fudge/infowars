[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.160 --> 00:20.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:29.720]  well you have to see it and hear it to believe it the Pope says that Christ
[00:29.720 --> 00:34.800]  failed on the cross the entire of Christendom is based on Christ laying
[00:34.800 --> 00:40.960]  down his life willingly in the face of death and hell and being tortured to
[00:40.960 --> 00:46.560]  forgive us of our sins the ultimate sacrifice God sacrificing his son and
[00:46.560 --> 00:52.120]  echo of Abraham about to sacrifice his son but God following through on it
[00:52.120 --> 00:58.680]  let's roll the grand pontiff and what he had to say in Philadelphia yesterday
[00:58.680 --> 01:13.520]  and if at times our efforts and works seem to fail and not produce fruit we
[01:13.520 --> 01:22.600]  need to remember that we are followers of Jesus Christ and his life
[01:22.600 --> 01:33.240]  humanly speaking ended in failure the failure of the cross and then you go to
[01:33.240 --> 01:38.720]  the full clip I have the transcript he he doesn't continue to say but then
[01:38.720 --> 01:45.400]  Christ succeeded he just says he failed when of course Christ rose again if you
[01:45.400 --> 01:49.320]  are a Christian and you believe that and it was the greatest triumph
[01:49.320 --> 01:56.480]  jacari Jackson laid it out we're going to come back with the full clip and also
[01:56.480 --> 02:01.040]  jacari Jackson later in the hour and visit this but that's just one of the
[02:01.040 --> 02:07.160]  huge things we have here and I kind of psychoanalyze myself this weekend why
[02:07.160 --> 02:11.760]  I've been so particularly vicious to the Pope it's because I'm upset by I mean
[02:11.760 --> 02:16.400]  you know at least in the past Catholics were anti-communist in pro-life and this
[02:16.400 --> 02:21.480]  guy's promoting global government carbon taxes one world religion business
[02:21.480 --> 02:28.880]  chryslam the merger of Christianity and Islam and clearly Christianity's under
[02:28.880 --> 02:33.680]  massive attack I know the Catholic Church was blackmailed with the pedophile
[02:33.680 --> 02:38.280]  scandal put this guy in now he's covering that up and so I just feel
[02:38.280 --> 02:43.280]  desperate but I should attack the Pope more professionally because it's more
[02:43.280 --> 02:51.240]  effective than calling him names like scumbag and things but people didn't
[02:51.240 --> 02:56.520]  believe me eight nine years ago when I was sent by a listener a clip of Pastor
[02:56.520 --> 03:01.360]  John Hagee saying Christ did not come to be the Messiah who's a rebel who's
[03:01.360 --> 03:05.440]  dealt with wisely that's quote by the way and folks go then dig it up and find
[03:05.440 --> 03:09.840]  it and can't believe it he wrote a book about it and this is what the globalist
[03:09.840 --> 03:13.560]  want they want religious leaders Protestant Catholic whatever they'll
[03:13.560 --> 03:18.080]  start blurring the lines and his full quote is very
[03:18.360 --> 03:23.800]  Jewittical is the term they use or Jesuit oriented Hillary says she runs
[03:23.800 --> 03:29.320]  her life according to Georgetown Jewittical thinking where you could get
[03:29.320 --> 03:32.880]  what he's saying that Christ physically was killed but had the greater
[03:32.880 --> 03:40.760]  triumph but it's very twisted and has double meanings and when he says it he
[03:40.760 --> 03:45.600]  says it with wide eyes like he just said a bad word and that's what it's all
[03:45.600 --> 03:52.240]  about is lowering the deity of Christ lowering it lowering it lowering it
[03:52.240 --> 04:00.040]  lowering and those ideals it is true that you don't see the fruits of your
[04:00.040 --> 04:03.440]  labor a lot of times in your lifetime
[04:04.840 --> 04:13.000]  van Gogh the highest selling painter in the world average painting of his goes
[04:13.000 --> 04:18.160]  for about 52 million dollars Japanese elites will pay a hundred hundred and
[04:18.160 --> 04:29.560]  fifty million for a van Gogh he only sold one painting in his life so I
[04:29.560 --> 04:35.160]  certainly understand that labors don't give you instant gratification info
[04:35.160 --> 04:38.560]  wars is an example of that but as we just go year after year the drum beat
[04:38.560 --> 04:43.000]  gets louder and now we've got battering ram power to just ram into the globalist
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.440]  and tear huge holes on the side of their operations but with great power comes
[04:47.440 --> 04:53.080]  great responsibility and comes like our guest said yesterday Joe banister we're

[08:21.760 --> 08:28.600]  resistance it's Alex Jones he was on with us for an hour last week the
[08:28.600 --> 08:34.000]  consummate Vatican insider will be joining us from Rome Italy Leo Zagami
[08:34.000 --> 08:39.320]  author of the best-selling book The Last Pope he predicted three years before
[08:39.320 --> 08:46.960]  Pope Francis ascended to the throne that he would be a Jesuit Pope he named
[08:46.960 --> 08:50.960]  Pope Francis by name and one other person that he thought would be put in
[08:50.960 --> 08:56.320]  place via blackmail that indeed happened so he said he would come back with us
[08:56.320 --> 09:04.560]  this week to give commentary on the Pope's term of DC New York and of
[09:04.560 --> 09:09.760]  course Philadelphia from the district of criminals to the state of New York to
[09:09.760 --> 09:15.480]  the state of Pennsylvania and the cities therein we will also play a
[09:15.480 --> 09:20.640]  commentary that was shot live on the street by Jacarie Jackson where Pope
[09:20.640 --> 09:30.120]  Francis said Jesus failed on the cross humanly speaking when Christ said I am
[09:30.120 --> 09:35.720]  giving my life I lay it down willingly we will quote from the Bible the Pope
[09:35.720 --> 09:40.680]  knows full well what it says and this is the very nature of the New Age the very
[09:40.680 --> 09:50.280]  nature of the occult the very nature of the Illuminati is to downgrade Christ you
[09:50.280 --> 09:54.160]  notice the UN isn't attacking radical Islam the UN isn't attacking any other
[09:54.160 --> 09:58.120]  religion it's going after Christianity Christianity is the most persecuted
[09:58.120 --> 10:04.440]  religion from within and from without because it's not compatible with the
[10:04.440 --> 10:09.880]  one-world religion in the system that's coming into place and I'm not just
[10:09.880 --> 10:15.320]  singling out Catholics here I'm singling out the Protestant church and other
[10:15.320 --> 10:18.840]  major denominations they're all basically singing from the same piece of
[10:18.840 --> 10:26.320]  music now which is ecumenical world government one-world religion garbage
[10:26.320 --> 10:31.320]  and I had always straight away from criticizing Catholics that's all a lot
[10:31.320 --> 10:37.480]  of good fruits from Catholics the people fighting abortion fighting socialism
[10:37.480 --> 10:44.880]  but now with the establishment media praising the Pope you can see that this
[10:44.880 --> 10:49.920]  is just another shine of the times and how bad this push for world
[10:49.920 --> 10:55.480]  government's really gotten so that's in the second hour well I've opened phones
[10:55.480 --> 10:59.440]  the second half with Leo Zagami for your questions or comments and then of
[10:59.440 --> 11:02.880]  course in the third hour we'll cover a lot of other news we're going to try the
[11:02.880 --> 11:07.960]  shower to be disciplined and get to the news because we've got Obama's speech
[11:07.960 --> 11:15.120]  of the UN we have huge economic news we have massive news NASA scientists find
[11:15.120 --> 11:22.360]  evidence of flowing water on Mars during the summer Mars is extremely habitable
[11:22.360 --> 11:27.880]  ancients could the first telescopes 300 400 years ago I consider that ancient
[11:27.880 --> 11:31.720]  times compared to now though it's more modern compared to true ancient times
[11:31.720 --> 11:38.400]  you know 6,000 plus years ago could could could see the rivers on Mars and of
[11:38.400 --> 11:43.840]  course folks 200 300 years ago thought that there might even be canals on Mars
[11:43.840 --> 11:49.720]  but Mars does have an atmosphere it does have a northern southern ice cap that
[11:49.720 --> 11:56.400]  had been shrinking till about a decade ago from not global warming but solar
[11:56.400 --> 12:01.480]  system-wide warming because the Sun was in a really hot phase now it's gone into
[12:01.480 --> 12:05.200]  one of the coldest phases ever recorded in over 200 years by British
[12:05.200 --> 12:09.360]  astronomers are the first to record it with accurate devices that's why we
[12:09.360 --> 12:12.360]  have Greenwich meantime everything else based in England because they had the
[12:12.360 --> 12:20.800]  best scientists let's just face it that after the Germans the Italians and the
[12:20.800 --> 12:25.440]  Sun is probably the coolest ever recorded in modern times right now and so
[12:25.440 --> 12:29.400]  look out that's going to cause a lot of weather changes here and you're going to
[12:29.400 --> 12:33.080]  have the establishment running around hopping around calling for carbon
[12:33.080 --> 12:39.320]  indulgences to be paid to His Holiness Al Gore and Morocco Saint Obama or will
[12:39.320 --> 12:45.040]  be sent to global warming or climate change purgatory you know Mount
[12:45.040 --> 12:49.680]  Vesuvius didn't blow up and cover Pompeii and multinational lava because the
[12:49.680 --> 12:54.800]  Romans had too many outdoor fireplaces it happened because the earth is always
[12:54.800 --> 13:01.040]  changing and tectonic plates only about a mile and a half thick float on molten
[13:01.040 --> 13:08.680]  magma so I guess that congressman that thinks islands float he thinks Guam
[13:08.680 --> 13:13.360]  floats it's really just a mountain on the undersea floor obviously but in a way
[13:13.360 --> 13:19.440]  he's he's telling the truth in a way because the entire plate that that
[13:19.440 --> 13:25.200]  particular Pacific plate does float on lava and I guess sometimes they do cap
[13:25.200 --> 13:32.240]  size if a giant asteroid say five miles across made of nickel was a slam again
[13:32.240 --> 13:36.920]  and to say the Yucatan Peninsula yes you'd have piercing holes through the
[13:36.920 --> 13:42.520]  magma into the earth and lava shooting out into space and then getting into the
[13:42.520 --> 13:46.760]  atmosphere and causing a dark age for a couple hundred thousand years how's that
[13:46.760 --> 13:52.080]  sound and I don't mean a dark age where they ban literature and science and
[13:52.080 --> 13:59.160]  mathematics and and and medicine I mean a dark age where the entire planet's
[13:59.160 --> 14:08.240]  freezing yeah that was Hank Johnson thinks Guam could cap size anyways I'm
[14:08.240 --> 14:14.120]  digressing huge gigantor news NASA scientists find evidence of flowing
[14:14.120 --> 14:18.880]  water on Mars where Buzz Aldrin said that on the show a few years ago and they
[14:18.880 --> 14:21.960]  had water on the moon that he'd already found it but they weren't allowed to
[14:21.960 --> 14:25.480]  tell the public and they just went wild and started saying the same folks that
[14:25.480 --> 14:30.120]  put the obelisk on the moon of Mars the same ones put the pyramids I'm like wow
[14:30.120 --> 14:36.440]  why are you saying this on my show nowhere else not saying Aldrin's crazy
[14:36.440 --> 14:46.280]  I just I'm not even allowed to say so another thing Aldrin told me off air and
[14:46.280 --> 14:49.280]  and I'm not trying to sound like I'm special or something but this this
[14:49.280 --> 14:52.640]  weekend I was laying there in bed for about an hour during the day trying to
[14:52.640 --> 14:56.240]  take a nap because I had a sinus headache for mold allergies and I was laying
[14:56.240 --> 14:59.960]  back trying to get rid of beginnings of a migraine headache and I just started
[14:59.960 --> 15:03.920]  thinking about how weird my life is and I just like is this the matrix is this a
[15:03.920 --> 15:09.880]  dream is this really happening we really have congressmen that say that islands
[15:09.880 --> 15:14.880]  float and the second guy to walk on the moon comes on my show and says aliens
[15:14.880 --> 15:21.720]  built the pyramids I mean why me let's continue under pressure McConnell pushed
[15:21.720 --> 15:26.840]  to resign as Senate majority leader and he will go down there's a large
[15:26.840 --> 15:31.360]  contingent in the military in government and in corporations that don't
[15:31.360 --> 15:34.520]  want to go to America don't want to bankrupt America don't want to clout
[15:34.520 --> 15:39.200]  and pivot America and anyone caught working with this plan is going to be
[15:39.200 --> 15:47.200]  dealt with and as soon as McConnell and as soon as Boehner are gone either is a
[15:47.200 --> 15:51.520]  major fight to replace them with Patriots and then you know what's gonna
[15:51.520 --> 15:58.120]  happen instead of Patriots being indicted for no reason there's going to be
[15:58.120 --> 16:02.800]  indictments of people in the Democratic Party and they know that not because
[16:02.800 --> 16:06.400]  folks want to have this dangerous war with them people now realize that
[16:06.400 --> 16:11.000]  America is being destroyed by design there's a plan to wreck the country and
[16:11.000 --> 16:15.000]  there's large contingents of Republicans now that aren't going to play politics
[16:15.000 --> 16:18.040]  and aren't going to work with the Democrats because they understand it is
[16:18.040 --> 16:23.840]  a political death battle and the Democrats broke a hundred-year-old compact
[16:23.840 --> 16:28.080]  that was private and quiet that the two parties wouldn't try to destroy each
[16:28.080 --> 16:34.160]  other and that agreement has been destroyed by Obama and so a war is now
[16:34.160 --> 16:41.760]  on in the power structure you heard it here first and we're gonna see in this
[16:41.760 --> 16:47.680]  fight 1776 part 2 just who's got the will and who's got the power and who's
[16:47.680 --> 16:54.040]  got the people but I wouldn't be betting on all the corrupt and all the scum
[16:54.040 --> 16:59.400]  GOP discontent that helps sink John Boehner isn't easing up that's why Boehner
[16:59.400 --> 17:04.520]  and the Democrats put their full money and full power against the Tea Party and
[17:04.520 --> 17:08.160]  if you read the White House publications their full hate at the
[17:08.160 --> 17:13.840]  drudge report info wars world net daily Breitbart Glenback Rush Limbaugh and it
[17:13.840 --> 17:17.320]  doesn't mean I even agree with all those people I just listed but none of those
[17:17.320 --> 17:20.400]  people want to bankrupt the country none of those people want to bring
[17:20.400 --> 17:24.640]  Sharia law in none of those people want to break America's power none of those
[17:24.640 --> 17:27.840]  people want to wreck the dollar none of those people want to maneuver us in
[17:27.840 --> 17:33.800]  destruction like George Soros does by the way that Nazi collaborator piece of
[17:33.800 --> 17:39.240]  trash is in the news calling for Europe to accept over a million radical Muslims
[17:39.240 --> 17:45.440]  a year and pay for everything from a Romanian Nazi collaborator who's still
[17:45.440 --> 17:52.280]  around like some living fossil like a dirt dober nest on your roof lecturing
[17:52.280 --> 17:56.960]  everyone about how we've got to accept all these people just because he
[17:56.960 --> 18:02.520]  literally hates the West and wants to wreck it and just screw it up
[18:02.520 --> 18:07.880]  Trump has come out with I've read over the Wall Street Journal article what
[18:07.880 --> 18:16.440]  really makes sense as a super-duper tax program a massive tax decrease for the
[18:16.440 --> 18:21.080]  middle class and the Nouveau Reich and the working poor not as big as what
[18:21.080 --> 18:28.120]  Kennedy did but similar and a whopping 10% levy on all which it should be like
[18:28.120 --> 18:33.360]  50% on all the multinational US based companies that wrote the laws where
[18:33.360 --> 18:38.240]  their tax exempt so they take all their profits outside Trump understands we need
[18:38.240 --> 18:42.280]  to bring a large portion of that money back but it shouldn't be 10% because
[18:42.280 --> 18:48.400]  they haven't paid more than 20 years basically any taxes they take their
[18:48.400 --> 18:54.640]  profits outside the country to tax exempt havens and so we need to drag that
[18:54.640 --> 18:58.880]  money back in it's time for the globalist general electric google
[18:58.880 --> 19:05.680]  apple it's time for the fortune 100 Lockheed Martin all of you guys America
[19:05.680 --> 19:10.240]  built you gave you the power over the planet and now you want to sink it so
[19:10.240 --> 19:14.800]  you could politically control it no you are gonna send that money back in here
[19:14.800 --> 19:18.080]  you took that money out of this country you're gonna bring that money back into
[19:18.080 --> 19:23.000]  this country we've spent trillions of dollars the last 20 30 years plus
[19:23.000 --> 19:27.480]  propping up all these countries giving them free money doing all this and now
[19:27.480 --> 19:36.600]  America is falling apart bring it back he's be more than 10% I mean Obamacare
[19:36.600 --> 19:41.200]  it's why I get so violently angry when I think about it massively increasing taxes
[19:41.200 --> 19:45.600]  on people making less than $17,000 a year shutting the economy down and they
[19:45.600 --> 19:48.840]  have all these fake liberals on TV talking about how it's there to help poor
[19:48.840 --> 19:52.520]  people yeah help them like shoving a double-edged dagger between their ribs

[21:07.400 --> 21:10.920]  pickpocketing ten years ago I created a way to protect my own cards from prying
[21:10.920 --> 21:14.360]  eyes after government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card
[21:14.360 --> 21:18.560]  with a built-in radio chip called RFID I felt having to broadcast my personal
[21:18.560 --> 21:22.680]  information was an invasion of privacy soon after it was also announced that
[21:22.680 --> 21:27.080]  credit cards debit cards us passports hotel room keys and even transit passes
[21:27.080 --> 21:31.680]  would all soon incorporate RFID it was then I formed ID Stronghold to share my
[21:31.680 --> 21:35.280]  inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world there are a lot of

[30:04.200 --> 30:07.480]  reverting back to the Middle Ages where you had to watch what you said in fear
[30:07.480 --> 30:11.760]  fines or even violent punishment for example at a so-called free speech event
[30:11.760 --> 30:15.880]  in London any anti-ISIS piece of art was banned after police demanded the artist
[30:15.880 --> 30:20.600]  pay 36,000 pounds for its potentially inflammatory content according to
[30:20.600 --> 30:24.480]  event organizers the police made it clear they would pass the cost of extra
[30:24.480 --> 30:28.560]  police protection on the artist in the organizers so in other words if you want
[30:28.560 --> 30:32.320]  to exercise your free speech in the UK you got to cough up a lot of money first
[30:32.320 --> 30:36.400]  similarly colleges across the United States are forcing students to apply for

[35:16.360 --> 35:21.080]  $45 a barrel or something let's check what crude is today Brent crude what's
[35:21.080 --> 35:30.480]  Brent crude today not sweet but Brent crude not light oil not sweet Brent
[35:30.480 --> 35:39.360]  crude $47.50 at that amount for how long it's been hovering in the 40s we
[35:39.360 --> 35:49.280]  should be paying about a dollar maybe a dollar a gallon and that's with taxes but
[35:49.280 --> 35:52.960]  notice you're not and that's because again the new world order doesn't let us
[35:52.960 --> 35:57.000]  have new refineries and the Associated Press sued to its credit back we still
[35:57.000 --> 36:00.760]  had some free press in this country in 2001 and got thousands of pages of
[36:00.760 --> 36:07.120]  documents from 96 and 97 where the big 10 oil companies met in the United States
[36:07.120 --> 36:11.600]  and decided to shut down wall refineries and to shut down small
[36:11.600 --> 36:15.520]  refineries and to shut down the new building of refineries and to fund the
[36:15.520 --> 36:21.160]  environmental movement to do it you know who runs the carbon tax push you know
[36:21.160 --> 36:25.200]  who gives more money than any other institution Goldman Sachs guess who
[36:25.200 --> 36:30.760]  next gives the most money in a consortium of giving British Petroleum and Dutch
[36:30.760 --> 36:36.600]  Royal Shell are the second largest funders of carbon tax global warming
[36:36.600 --> 36:41.480]  baloney and then when I get up and criticize carbon taxes the brain dead
[36:41.480 --> 36:46.160]  liberal trendies send me emails saying I know you're paid off by the oil
[36:46.160 --> 36:53.080]  companies that's how stupid you are that's how dumb you are that's how
[36:53.080 --> 36:58.800]  mindless you are that's how helpless you are that's how pathetic and arrogant
[36:58.800 --> 37:05.520]  you are is that you are just absolutely turned over to fraud and lies and scams
[37:05.520 --> 37:16.440]  and you love it you will love it and so Europe's cheating on its emissions it's
[37:16.440 --> 37:22.160]  leaked it's going to come out that every major European manufacturers doing this
[37:23.160 --> 37:27.360]  I'm not saying they're all gonna have the Volkswagen fraud because Audi is a
[37:27.360 --> 37:33.200]  subsidiary of the people's wagon but you will have similar cockamamie systems to
[37:33.200 --> 37:38.120]  do this because I've never seen a complex tech device that didn't have trojan
[37:38.120 --> 37:46.560]  horses laid into it I remember being told 13 years ago by an engineer 14
[37:46.560 --> 37:50.800]  years ago that it didn't matter if computers weren't hooked to the internet
[37:50.800 --> 37:56.600]  that all computers that had been made in the last decade or so this is 20
[37:56.600 --> 38:00.600]  years he was telling me 13 14 years ago that the last decade so that'd be 20
[38:00.600 --> 38:09.480]  years back or more they all had transponder chips capacitor chips in the
[38:09.480 --> 38:17.000]  chips that could be remotely powered by an energy wave that's fired at them so
[38:17.000 --> 38:21.600]  that then the government could download the encrypted data off of it and
[38:21.600 --> 38:27.080]  compress it so your computer is more high-tech than you even know you're
[38:27.080 --> 38:33.800]  paying for phones and computers and appliances way more than they should
[38:33.800 --> 38:39.920]  cost because of secret global compacts and agreements what came out four years
[38:39.920 --> 38:46.960]  ago that Intel and others have secret NSA contracts and are putting the
[38:46.960 --> 38:54.320]  capacitor chips in all the computers and I've talked to family that's worked at
[38:54.320 --> 39:01.440]  major silicon manufacturers in California and in Austin and the
[39:01.440 --> 39:05.600]  government comes in the guys with the bunny suits are kicked out people come
[39:05.600 --> 39:09.720]  if they don't even know what the government's putting in there it is
[39:09.720 --> 39:14.560]  snooping it's not a crime it's a feature new apps hijacked the microphone
[39:14.560 --> 39:19.080]  your cell phone to listen to your life see it's all fun and happy but let's go
[39:19.080 --> 39:27.800]  back and look at the Intel chips secret 3g Intel chip gives snoops backdoor PC
[39:27.800 --> 39:35.920]  access and again the chip is energized remotely even when your computer is off
[39:35.920 --> 39:43.240]  they can order it to it needs more power to download your whole computer it will
[39:43.240 --> 39:46.720]  scan it to see when the computer was last turned on has an algorithm that you
[39:46.720 --> 39:49.680]  must not be home they now have more sophisticated algorithms where they get
[39:49.680 --> 39:52.840]  data over power line they can also take your computer over that way it's not
[39:52.840 --> 39:56.320]  hooked to the internet but it's hooked to a power cord it then goes in besides
[39:56.320 --> 40:03.040]  you're not there fires the computer up and then gets all the data so loving I
[40:03.040 --> 40:06.320]  remember telling you over a decade ago not bragging just telling you that
[40:06.320 --> 40:12.480]  DARPA was putting implantable microchips in PTSD soldiers brains and giving them
[40:12.480 --> 40:17.760]  vaccines that basically eight part of their brain and now today it's in the
[40:17.760 --> 40:22.440]  news that DARPA is putting brain chips in people it was already in the medical
[40:22.440 --> 40:29.560]  journals all I'm telling you is we don't make this stuff up there it is fusion
[40:29.560 --> 40:36.760]  DARPA is implanting chips in soldiers brains according to this new book oh my
[40:36.760 --> 40:43.240]  gosh give them a pull it surprised they went to the DARPA website I know soldiers
[40:43.240 --> 40:51.840]  that have brain chips I have family that was implanted eight nine years ago with
[40:51.840 --> 40:54.760]  under the skin chip
[40:58.800 --> 41:03.240]  but they sit there and they tell you none of this is going on none of this is
[41:03.240 --> 41:06.600]  happening I don't mean some chip because you've got epilepsy that's simply
[41:06.600 --> 41:10.240]  picks up your brain activity when you're about to have a seizure and controls
[41:10.240 --> 41:20.960]  it I'm talking about stuff that controls basically everything you're doing and
[41:20.960 --> 41:28.560]  they can kill you when they want to okay I kind of got bogged down in that area
[41:28.560 --> 41:32.960]  of stories maybe I should just start over with these headlines right now
[41:32.960 --> 41:39.000]  under pressure mcconnell pushed to resign as Senate majority leader GOP
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.560]  discontent that helps sink John Boehner isn't easing up Wall Street Journal
[41:43.560 --> 41:48.600]  here's the financial news 17.4 million Americans hit by identity theft last
[41:48.600 --> 41:53.480]  year 66% of victims suffered direct financial loss just gets exponentially
[41:53.480 --> 41:57.520]  worse all by design to make you go to biometrics which has also been hacked
[41:57.520 --> 42:02.160]  already they had a hack of 5.6 million FBI fingerprints last week by design of
[42:02.160 --> 42:06.000]  course the FBI that's always releasing most the major Trojans most the major
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.640]  worms most the major problems Dow Jones industrial average drops as Wall Street
[42:10.640 --> 42:14.840]  weighs Federal Reserve uncertainty looming government shutdown
[42:14.840 --> 42:19.560]  Federal Reserve officials could provide more clues as to the timing of the
[42:19.560 --> 42:24.720]  central banks inevitable rate hike what recovery 9.4 million more Americans
[42:24.720 --> 42:33.360]  blow poverty line then pre-crisis 2008 Spain process session parties in
[42:33.360 --> 42:39.440]  Catalonia win landmark vote to begin process to succeed it's the basically
[42:39.440 --> 42:43.320]  the only productive area of Spain now every house I will almost every house I
[42:43.320 --> 42:47.040]  walk by while I was in Catalonia in Barcelona it's in that state in that
[42:47.040 --> 42:52.400]  region they're not really Spanish not really French they want out of there
[42:52.400 --> 42:56.760]  they want out from under socialism they're really cool people I really
[42:56.760 --> 43:01.720]  like the folks in Catalonia and Spain saying we're not gonna recognize that
[43:01.720 --> 43:05.760]  oh really what are you gonna do with like 80% of people stop following your
[43:05.760 --> 43:12.160]  orders you're gonna do nothing you have no power to order the minute we take it
[43:12.160 --> 43:16.000]  back from you the minute we hate your stinking rotten criminal filthy
[43:16.000 --> 43:22.680]  maggot filled guts oh here's another big story Washington Post how the American
[43:22.680 --> 43:25.920]  government is trying to control what you think and they admit that there's
[43:25.920 --> 43:32.480]  massive propaganda and massive manipulation and CIA psychiatrist teams
[43:32.480 --> 43:39.200]  running around brainwashing everybody might have heard that somewhere else a
[43:39.200 --> 43:42.480]  few times but now it's just out in the open because they're going operational
[43:42.480 --> 43:46.520]  remember the Pentagon a year and a half ago Gus because of the drudge report
[43:46.520 --> 43:49.720]  another alternative media we're gonna stop lying we apologize for stop lying
[43:49.720 --> 43:53.680]  I'm the undersecretary of defense the deputy secretary defense and I'm here
[43:53.680 --> 43:57.600]  to tell you everything's fine we're gonna work with you in every community in
[43:57.600 --> 44:01.440]  town every newspaper every website the US Army's here to help with the rest of
[44:01.440 --> 44:06.080]  the joint services and it showed the military the generals the playing close
[44:06.080 --> 44:09.720]  people just shaking their heads some had tears in their eyes they had their heads
[44:09.720 --> 44:12.920]  in their hands because they knew what this meant full roll out we're here to
[44:12.920 --> 44:17.560]  help and stop lying we're here to be domestically with you we're here to
[44:17.560 --> 44:26.240]  teach you how bad mommy and daddy are and how the carbon taxes are good and now
[44:26.240 --> 44:29.800]  they just admit it all because see they've got to just roll it out and go
[44:29.800 --> 44:33.600]  well of course we arrest people that disagree with the government that's MSNBC
[44:33.600 --> 44:40.080]  they go thank goodness thank God Rachel Maddow and others I've seen them say it
[44:40.080 --> 44:42.920]  I'll play the clips of course we're arresting Tea Party of course we're
[44:42.920 --> 44:46.400]  taking your tax exemptions of course we're gonna put you in jail you're
[44:46.400 --> 44:50.360]  criminal racist but of course we're arresting all the Jews and putting them
[44:50.360 --> 44:54.080]  in concentration camps of course we're arresting the anti-communist in Russia
[44:54.080 --> 44:57.720]  and putting them in forced labor gulags of course Alexander Sultan each has been
[44:57.720 --> 45:07.760]  locked up we're tyrants we've taken over I mean just flaming totalitarian
[45:07.760 --> 45:11.680]  scum parading up and down if everyone and everybody's supposed to just cower and
[45:11.680 --> 45:19.200]  go okay I I was out barbecuing and a couple liberals were out there last
[45:19.200 --> 45:24.840]  night some folks at some of the family knows and so they came over there like
[45:24.840 --> 45:27.560]  you know I think this political correctness is getting a little out
[45:27.560 --> 45:35.560]  of hand because they didn't really know who I am I'm just like yeah it's not
[45:35.560 --> 45:40.400]  supposed it's supposed to be like that lady yeah like comedians can't make
[45:40.400 --> 45:44.400]  jokes and now they're saying just being heterosexuals bad and I don't know what's
[45:44.400 --> 45:48.120]  going on I mean it's gotten extreme and we've got to accept Sharia law and I
[45:48.120 --> 45:51.520]  don't know what's going on and I you don't know what's going on you're being
[45:51.520 --> 45:57.880]  conquered you had your culture taken away you were trained to roll over it's
[45:57.880 --> 46:03.680]  like putting a fat Papillon dog little sweet dog out in the middle of Yellowstone
[46:03.680 --> 46:07.400]  Park in the middle of the night near the wolf packs they're gonna come out and
[46:07.400 --> 46:12.800]  eat it you're a little cute little puppy a little jingly oh hi hi mr. Wolf I want
[46:12.800 --> 46:18.920]  to be your friend oh you be my friend you're like but I'm cute I'm sweet
[46:18.920 --> 46:25.840]  the hell I complied with everything you said I rolled over I showed you my pink
[46:25.840 --> 46:37.400]  belly and so you'll have everything taken from you because you wanted to feel
[46:37.400 --> 46:39.800]  like you were on a winning team you were part of the Democrats you were part of
[46:39.800 --> 46:43.400]  the Republicans you were part of the establishment you you you would watch the
[46:43.400 --> 46:47.840]  news and in a studious way regurgitate exactly what you heard to try to sound
[46:47.840 --> 46:51.400]  smart and you know you'd sit there and talk about football with your friends and
[46:51.400 --> 46:55.880]  feel real smart about that well the whole world was being stolen from you
[46:55.880 --> 47:00.480]  well cancer viruses were being put in the medicine chain in your vaccines while
[47:00.480 --> 47:03.760]  you were being poisoned the water being poisoned your food being poisoned while
[47:03.760 --> 47:07.360]  the diseases exploded while you were being murdered while it was all happening
[47:07.360 --> 47:15.760]  it was all funny to them because they live you sleep only admitting the full
[47:15.760 --> 47:24.040]  horror will stop them all tech put out by globalist is designed for something
[47:24.040 --> 47:28.320]  totally different than what they tell you it's for I'll tell you right now
[47:28.320 --> 47:33.240]  Audi and Volkswagen are the ones coming out with cars that watch you cars that
[47:33.240 --> 47:35.840]  can tell if you're nervous and call the police cars that can tell you're too
[47:35.840 --> 47:46.840]  sleepy so are the Japanese I've told people I was told by a source that on
[47:46.840 --> 47:52.400]  Star was listening to everything you do five years later it was all admitted you've
[47:52.400 --> 47:59.400]  got to reject all this and say I'm not buying an Audi or a Ford or a Chevy that
[47:59.400 --> 48:05.680]  has any of this in it I don't want the smart intelligent car because it's not
[48:05.680 --> 48:09.400]  straight technology we're being given to enhance our lives and our safety it's
[48:09.400 --> 48:13.040]  being given to us show that when the globalist takeover no one can stand
[48:13.040 --> 48:17.280]  against them because everything our way of life is destroyed there's no
[48:17.280 --> 48:22.560]  self-sufficiency and all tech is there as a prison to control us this is the
[48:22.560 --> 48:28.600]  admitted technocrat new world order takeover program in their own words they
[48:28.600 --> 48:40.560]  call themselves technocrat which means a technological dictator system coming up
[48:40.560 --> 48:45.520]  Israel will allow police to fire live ammunition and protesters and I just
[48:45.520 --> 48:48.600]  love this Orwellian article out of Los Angeles Times I'm gonna cover when we
[48:48.600 --> 48:52.840]  come back because whether you're for Israel or against Israel whatever it is
[48:52.840 --> 48:56.240]  the most Orwellian you want to know how they sell it they say basically if
[48:56.240 --> 49:01.040]  you're a demonstrator they're going to shoot you with lead ammunition but don't
[49:01.040 --> 49:04.360]  worry it's small caliber
[49:07.200 --> 49:13.680]  they're acting like it's not lethal two to three is one of the most deadly
[49:13.680 --> 49:19.400]  rounds there is it disintegrates when I hit you and opens up it was because they
[49:19.400 --> 49:23.320]  wanted to kill more people in Maine more people in Vietnam and so they could
[49:23.320 --> 49:26.240]  they had to have full metal jacket under the Geneva convention so they made a
[49:26.240 --> 49:32.000]  full metal jacket hyper-velocity round that breaks up when it hits bone it's
[49:32.000 --> 49:37.000]  basically a fragmentation kinetic weapon any bullets a kinetic weapon but it's a
[49:37.000 --> 49:44.480]  fragmentation kinetic weapon that gets around the Geneva we're gonna shoot you
[49:44.480 --> 49:51.280]  with two two three from a ruger range rifle and it's okay oh oh my that's how
[49:51.280 --> 49:55.080]  to cover after the break I just had to cover it right then
[49:58.840 --> 50:03.560]  oh I'm sorry I'm crying that's so hilarious oh my gosh that is the funniest
[50:03.560 --> 50:08.840]  thing I've ever heard in my life we're gonna shoot you with an m16 round but
[50:08.840 --> 50:16.120]  don't worry it's small caliber I'm sorry I'm gonna stop right there I'm gonna
[50:16.120 --> 50:21.200]  stop right there oh man I didn't used to like M4s they really perfected them
[50:21.200 --> 50:24.240]  in the last decade I remember the old days being a kid you know shooting
[50:24.240 --> 50:28.400]  semi-auto m16s AR-15s I like them they'd have problems and stuff but man the
[50:28.400 --> 50:32.920]  ones they've got now are just amazing oh I actually started tearing up with the
[50:32.920 --> 50:37.720]  just hilarious hilarity there for a moment um we're getting to Joe Biden

[54:36.440 --> 54:39.200]  regardless what you think about this people throwing Molotov cocktails at
[54:39.200 --> 54:42.720]  you I mean I could see shooting at them it's just saying they say later but don't
[54:42.720 --> 54:48.520]  worry it's a very low caliber 223 they said Wildcat rounds were like 15
[54:48.520 --> 54:52.280]  caliber they're even more deadly they're like 5,000 feet per second these are
[54:52.280 --> 55:02.760]  like almost 3,000 feet per second and then it just goes on to say that it's
[55:02.760 --> 55:14.520]  okay because it's a smaller round simply ridiculous smaller caliber rounds from
[55:14.520 --> 55:22.280]  Ruger rifles at people hurling stones so that just shows how stories can be
[55:22.280 --> 55:26.680]  absolutely spine to the thousands degree I want to get into Joe Biden the

[56:47.960 --> 56:50.520]  got up on air last night I got up on air last week and I said I don't think the
[56:50.520 --> 56:54.360]  blood moons are gonna cause anything I don't think it's connected anything the
[56:54.360 --> 56:57.720]  elite are obsessed with it they might do something but the real crisis is
[56:57.720 --> 57:02.840]  financial meltdown war with Russia ice is out of control flesh-eating bacteria
[57:02.840 --> 57:07.640]  CERN collider there's a lot of crazy technologies and things they could get
[57:07.640 --> 57:11.800]  out of hand so I'm not saying the world isn't major turmoil the Pentagon admits
[57:11.800 --> 57:17.480]  one of the most dangerous times in human history I'm saying blaming it on the
[57:17.480 --> 57:22.680]  blood moon I mean we go through these cycles it's how the moon goes around the
[57:22.680 --> 57:30.160]  earth the Jewish calendar is set to it because they marked it down back then
[57:30.160 --> 57:33.120]  it's like oh my god all the Jewish holidays are following on the blood
[57:33.120 --> 57:37.280]  moons what this means it's the end of the world no the Jews set it up on the
[57:37.280 --> 57:41.200]  moon the Sabbath was based on the moon that's why that was going on so folks
[57:41.200 --> 57:44.280]  are like oh the Schmidt is over the blood moon didn't kill everybody I don't

[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:19.360]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:25.040]  Alex Jones even if you're not into religion you should care what the
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:29.920]  leader of 1 billion people as to say we're talking about Pope Francis who
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:32.960]  ended his career yesterday promoting world government carbon taxes and the
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:37.800]  rest of it in Philadelphia jacari Jackson was there and I wanted to play the
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:42.280]  Pope what he had to say about Christ's human failure on the cross his greatest
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:56.680]  triumph there it is and if at times our efforts and works seem to fail and not
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:07.320]  produce fruit we need to remember that we are followers of Jesus Christ and his
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:16.360]  life humanly speaking ended in failure the failure of the cross the entire
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:20.880]  Christian faith is based on the great victory all three Gospels say he laid
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:25.400]  it down willingly it was a sacrifice and that it was Christ's greatest triumph
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:29.880]  and he says it's a failure and then twist it but oh see it became great later
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:34.040]  and then nothing we have the full transcript that's the all the clip we
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:39.520]  can find the full transcript jacari Jackson right over where he he didn't
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:42.880]  come out and say and then he rose again I mean this this is this is over the top
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:47.200]  and when a great maybe he's a wonderful guy a great little socialist it's just
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:53.480]  this isn't biblical let's go to the jacari Jackson report jacari Jackson for
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:58.480]  info wars.com reporting in Philadelphia this is the last day of the Pope's
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:03.040]  visit now since he's been here he's said and done a lot of things but a thing
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:06.640]  that stuck out to me the most is something he said during I guess it was a
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:11.840]  mass where he came out and said that the life of Jesus ultimately ended in
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:16.200]  failure in the failure on the cross I have the transcript here this is
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:22.360]  reported by ABC News and it says in part the cross shows us a different way of
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:27.480]  measuring success ours is to plant the seed God sees the fruit of our labors
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:32.400]  and if at times our efforts and work seem to fail and not produce fruit we
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:36.480]  need to remember that we are followers of Jesus Christ and his life humanly
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:41.400]  speaking ended in failure at the failure of the cross then he went on to talk
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:45.920]  about the dangers of being comfortable with surroundings and things such as
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:50.200]  that which is a whole nother topic in and of itself but he says the failure of
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:54.960]  Jesus the failure of the cross even though the Bible clearly states that
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:59.320]  Jesus knew what was going to happen to him far as the cross were concerned how
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:03.720]  he is going to lay his life down he even said Lord if it is your will take this
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:08.680]  bitter cup from me but not your will but not my will your will be done and
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:13.800]  particularly we know this when we look at John 17 and 18 therefore doth my
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:19.080]  father love me because I laid my life down that I might take it again no man
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:24.040]  take it that from me but I lay it down myself which is to say nobody took his
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:28.360]  life from him on the cross he laid it down willingly he knew what was going
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:33.640]  to happen to him so to say that his life in general the cross in particular was
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:37.600]  a failure it's something I'm very disappointed to see from a supposed
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:41.440]  spiritual leader and there are many other things I get to talk about as far
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:45.600]  as the pope but this is something a glaring thing that stuck out to me so
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:49.680]  anybody who claims to be a follower of Christ I'm surprised if they're not as
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:54.880]  shocked and appalled by this as I am I found it to be very disturbing and a
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:59.680]  very sour note to have while he was here in the United States of America you
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:04.600]  can find more reports on info wars dot com and the car he's now back in Texas
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:09.160]  he's off a few days I'll be back in studio with us Wednesday Leo Zagami
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.960]  Vatican insiders going to be joining us he was with us last week I want to get
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:17.440]  his take on what he predicted we would see would he meet with Putin and what
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:20.880]  would come out of that what would the Chinese announce that would be a big
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:24.760]  sign on whether the global fix was in or whether there was a split and we'll
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:28.480]  get Zagami's expert take on that but let's go out to break with Pope Francis
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:41.000]  again on Christ failure here it is and if at times our efforts and works seem
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  to fail and not produce fruit we need to remember that we are followers of Jesus
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:05:00.120]  Christ and his life humanly speaking ended in failure Daniels info wars

[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:44.040]  be covering that the next hour Biden will have a chance to appear in the first
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:49.920]  Democratic debate CNN says Trump has a plan to cut taxes for millions but to
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:54.800]  claw back these tax exempt corporations that move their money offshore a 10%
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:09:02.040]  one-time levy which I think it should be higher so we'll be breaking all of that
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:07.720]  down I like lower taxes folks but I don't like googled and Microsoft and
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:12.840]  General Electric and all the rest of them Walmart moving their money offshore
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:18.200]  that was made here it's writing the laws so they're exempt while they lobby for
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:23.160]  middle-class taxes to be raised did you know that Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Wells
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:29.120]  Fargo they all do it they all do it just like George Soros lobbies for higher
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:32.360]  taxes and it turns out he's exempt from them so now they're trying to pass along
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:37.040]  Congress to claw back like eight billion from it Warren Buffett oh I need to pay
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:41.680]  our taxes and he gets the laws written where he doesn't we need to raise taxes
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:44.840]  on rich people then it's on the middle class because he knows somebody making
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:50.880]  30,000 a year thinks somebody making 200,000 a year is rich every actuary
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:55.480]  shows the guy making 200,000 a year literally is the economy they've got
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:59.840]  the employees they get the services they buy the boats their wives by the boots
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:04.200]  they go on the vacations you get rid of those people which they're doing it's
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:10.760]  over it's over we become a third-world country there's no economy just giant
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:16.360]  slums everywhere and then the high up on the mountain you know the the ultra-rich
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:21.120]  areas when they fly down to the airport by helicopter and never even get down
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:26.800]  here with the unwashed masses that's what we're going through it's all coming up
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:30.400]  meanwhile Europe seizing homes to house Muslim migrants it's now confirmed
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:35.640]  Soros demands Europe accept millions of Muslims annually China's military
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:39.720]  advisors it's now confirmed we reported on it Sunday Kurt Nemo reported on it
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:43.360]  out of the Israeli news it's now confirmed by RT in China they're quote
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:47.520]  heading to Syria to help fight ISIS the Chinese have now said aircraft carrier
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:53.160]  disgorge tanks helicopters missiles 1,000 Marines and more battle cruisers are
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:58.840]  now landing disgorging troops to fight Islamic State and China and Russia are
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:05.120]  inviting the US to actually take out the Saudi Arabian force which that won't
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:09.760]  be happening it's now like the war in the 80s against these Soviets and the
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:16.040]  proxy war in Afghanistan but but we quote I guess thought they were good
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:21.320]  guys then huh well now we know they're super bad and Syria didn't attack
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:25.520]  anybody so Russia and China are now in the good guy position we're in the bad
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:30.040]  guy position which is being maneuvered by the globalist down the road to set us
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:34.000]  up for a fall and our military knows that that's why they've been blowing the
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:40.680]  whistle on this it's huge talk about huge NASA scientists find evidence of
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:44.600]  flowing water on Mars the probe picks it up during the summer months there are
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:51.720]  creeks and streams and rivers on Mars it has an atmosphere it is habitable
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:57.600]  simply amazing and we now know what the ancients said in legend that it once had
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:04.840]  a thicker atmosphere and oceans and it lost its atmosphere the Atlantean
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:12.320]  legends written about by Plato claim that there was a connection to Mars and
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:17.240]  Atlantis and that Atlantis lost its atmosphere and that Mars lost its
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:20.960]  atmosphere and that we're connected to Mars I don't know that's true or not the
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:27.640]  ancients said it now it's coming true and Buzz Aldrin planned there was a
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:35.880]  connection between Mars and an obelisk on its century moon it's one moon and an
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:40.240]  obelisk pointed at Egypt that's the second guy to walk on the moon I don't
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:43.680]  usually get off into flying saucer stuff but when it's Buzz Aldrin you got to
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:49.560]  really ask what's going on what are the elite no we don't know so that's some
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:53.800]  of the news on that front huge economic news this giant news just broke school
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:58.920]  and this is not the first time that this is under this under common core get
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:04.000]  Daniels info wars.com prisonplanet.com the story needs to go viral folks school
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:09.200]  ask students for number of guns political views held by family what are
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:13.040]  your parents political views the gun survey asked does your family on any
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:16.560]  guns as the high school survey reportedly sent to 100 students if so how
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:20.760]  many the gun survey you got a lot of ATF programs where they mentor the sheriff
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:24.800]  department guarantee this is part of it look into that Daniels the gun survey
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:28.400]  given to journalist students in Hendrickson high school in Flugerville
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:34.240]  Texas also asked students for their parents political views talk about a
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:42.480]  scandal they've also had questionnaires in schools where it asks you know what's
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:46.920]  in your parents medicine cabinet do they smoke pot what are your parents
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:51.480]  political views the survey asked what are their political views the survey is
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:54.680]  invasive to say the least the second amendment is the great conversation for
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:57.240]  kids to have in the classroom and definitely for journalism because it
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:00.560]  applies directly to our Constitution but the question that concerns me are the
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:03.440]  ones that ask how many farms is your parents having your home and what
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:08.000]  political affiliations your parents have radio hosts and gun rights activists
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:16.760]  Michael Cargill said that's private I guess it's Michael Cargill frequent
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:19.200]  guests of this show that found out about let's me to get him in here about this
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:22.840]  maybe on the nightly news as the survey can be used against the student and his
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:27.080]  family this is huge and I know he just turned this article out real quick kit
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:30.960]  you might add they've done this before they have ATF grants they have ATF
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:35.280]  agents in the sheriff's department in schools the last time I saw was in
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:39.400]  Alabama doing this and it's all just part of it intelligence gathering
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:43.400]  database on the parents which was in the Washington Post Sunday admitting they've
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:48.440]  now got CIA psychiatrist you name it embedded running whole teams and
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:54.440]  psyops in every town and city and under the rural commission the Pentagon runs
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:57.960]  that over the 10 FEMA regions they're now putting plain clothes military in
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:02.680]  every state that's why we said Operation Jade Helms is further conditioning
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:06.520]  for the soft rollout of this not the imminent rollout of martial law
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:10.200]  everything's a conditioning program like all the major streets shut down for
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:14.400]  two days in Philadelphia not allowed to walk around at 10 o'clock at night no
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:20.640]  taxis that's in CBS News local chef on papal visit didn't need to close every
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:25.640]  street scaring most people CBS News saying this is happening this is the slow
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:30.880]  incremental psychological warfare conditioning now joining us for the
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:33.600]  balance of the hour and a little bit of the next hour we'll open the phones up
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:41.000]  for him as well is Leo Zegami Leo Zegami is on record being part of one of the
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:49.480]  most powerful masonic Vatican lodges and his family being Italian senators and
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:53.560]  stuff like that he's run for national office as well he's been arrested for
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:58.640]  his a speech he's a best-selling author who I guess it was five years ago
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:02.800]  clinic we're gonna put a Vatican of six years ago a Jesuit Pope in the Vatican
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:06.880]  using pedophile scandal blackmail then it all happened a few years later who he
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:10.800]  named became the new Pope and even the Guardian and other publications admitted
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:14.840]  blackmail was used to put him in now the media is gone from trying to take down
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:18.240]  the Catholic Church which they clearly infiltrated a long time ago to fully
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:23.600]  taking it over and no more talk of pedophiles so he said last week he'd
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:30.240]  tell a lot from New York a lot from DC a lot from what you he met with what
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:34.880]  happened we see him joining forces with the Chinese president the communist
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:39.160]  president and Obama he said we'd watch what happened with the Chinese and the
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:43.440]  Russians and we see what announcements were made so from those announcements
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:49.560]  Leo Zagami what can you make of what's happened sir hello everybody hello Alex
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:54.920]  I can say that the situation is actually very dramatic because the words of
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:17:02.160]  Putin are definitely of a complete defiance towards this new world order
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:08.880]  clearly stating that every country should be able to be sovereign and this
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:13.760]  sovereignty concept was expressed by Putin in his speech to the United Nations
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:20.920]  just an hour ago in a way that I think really has showed the whole world that
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:27.880]  this Obama and his agenda is completely something evil but of course the
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:32.280]  propaganda will make it as something good as you know in the meantime I would
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:36.000]  like to point out that in the Vatican there is some serious stuff happening in
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:41.400]  the last couple of days that of course you have not heard of in the US but it
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:47.560]  starting to make news here in Italy because 11 cardinals are basically
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:53.200]  starting to oppose the Pope and I've put together a document that they will
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:59.880]  present in October at this very famous and important scene of the gathering
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:05.160]  that is taking place with all the bishops so it's called the ordinary
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:12.160]  general assembly of the senior bishops from the 19th I think of October and so
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:18.480]  basically this rebellion right in the face of the pope sees people like Camillo
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:25.680]  Ruini, Cardinal Carlo Caffara, then we have Cardinal Urosa Savino, I mean we
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:30.440]  have many important cardinals that are just saying to the pope basically that
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:37.640]  is making a mockery of the faith and today on another newspaper in Italy an
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:45.000]  important Catholic writer and journalist asked Pope Francis to please stop
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:51.160]  with all this he said that he couldn't accept the fact that Pope Francis
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:56.920]  didn't even spend one word for the Christians who are being persecuted in
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:19:01.640]  the Middle East while he was addressing the United Nations and at the same time
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:07.600]  he didn't address the barbarities of the Castro regime and accepted this cross
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:12.920]  from Rao Castro made out of the boats when we all know that the castles and
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:18.880]  Cuba were actually throwing basically they were getting these boats that were
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:22.840]  arriving from Cuba to Miami they were sabotaging them all the time so
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:28.120]  basically a lot of people died leaving Cuba for America in hope of a better
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:33.000]  life because they were killed by the Castro regime in the open sea and the
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:38.880]  pope has said nothing about all this so and another thing that here in Italy is
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:44.200]  really creating outrage in the last few days has been this video report I'll
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:48.160]  stay there tell us about that report we come back and what the meetings with
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:52.320]  Putin and others signify and Putin's defiance who's joining the world

[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:11.200]  know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s and the
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:16.040]  remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat heck did you know that more than 90% of

[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:30.440]  just a recap two months ago the pope in three different speeches but in
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:39.680]  several letters issued by the papacy announcements ex-cathedra or from the
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:46.560]  throne there at Vatican City that global climate change is happening and that we
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:52.200]  have a responsibility to create a global government to respond to it and then
[01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:56.040]  he supports the treaty coming up in Paris that will complete world
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:04.360]  government and then now we've seen everything else has been added Vatican
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:09.560]  insider Leo Zagami who predicted that this man would be put on the throne
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:17.720]  years before it happened joins us he is the author of The Last Pope and he shows
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:21.120]  lightning striking the Vatican in the background on the cover of his book then
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:26.760]  the night we go to interview him we called him there's a thunderstorm and
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:30.760]  lightning was striking the Vatican again it was crazy but the cops are coming
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:33.680]  over to us we're on the sidewalk not even on the Vatican shooting on the
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:39.400]  square that's pretty dramatic footage it's demon possession inside the Vatican
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:44.880]  is the name of the video it's online in infowars.com this is short segment long
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:48.960]  segment coming up the toll-free number to ask your questions of Leo Zagami is
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:58.400]  800-259-9231-800-259-9231 on this subject specifically because it's such a
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:03.640]  big deal the mainstream media heralding him is the second coming basically no
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:07.440]  level of security not for any royalty not for a president whole city is
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:12.560]  completely shut down Philadelphia totally shut down just fawning socialist
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:16.160]  communist media I mean that ought to tell everybody something of the world
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:20.480]  loves your religious leader look out Leo Zagami you were gonna get into a
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:25.560]  report before you do that I know there's some conservative shake-ups there
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:31.120]  Cardinals challenging him then they're demoted but separately how big is this
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:34.360]  Putin situation I'm gonna do this segment on Putin you said you would watch
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:38.400]  carefully what happened in New York to gauge the power alignments what does it
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:44.280]  mean that the Chinese president had a love fest with the Pope I must say one
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:49.400]  thing that actually made me think a bit about the situation not being totally
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:54.760]  clear when Putin actually talked also about the climate change and about his
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:27:00.880]  own effort towards the process that will bring us to the planned meeting of
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:07.720]  December in Paris so it seems that on this climate change issue everybody is
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:15.200]  following the Pope in regards to the security issue at stake with America
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:21.720]  definitely this is the beginning of the second Cold War and we saw what happened
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:26.360]  with the first one we need to now get ready for the second one so there's gonna
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:35.040]  be a completely new world in which somebody is apparently opposing this
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:40.600]  new world order we don't know how genuine Putin is in this opposition but
[01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:46.720]  definitely the fact also that he is has created with bricks an opposition also to
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:52.200]  the World Bank and that he is definitely one of the main political leaders of
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:59.320]  nowadays gives us light hope that something is opposing Obama's and the
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:04.920]  Pope's New World Order faction I mean which is definitely taking control of
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:10.600]  the whole show as you see Obama is just following up on what the Pope has
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:16.880]  announced in the week preceding these meetings at the UN I've never seen such
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:22.560]  unity of purpose by even G8 or G20 member groups I mean Obama follows the
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:28.040]  pub's direction like our government is a bird dog following its master's order
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:32.920]  yeah I mean this finally really shows to the world what I have been talking about
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:39.280]  for years like you also said earlier which was the Jesuit Pope that would
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:45.560]  really lead the world leaders completely controlling them and and they
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:50.120]  would be happy to be controlled also there is this whole charade of the one
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:57.800]  world religion we have seen this strange ritual happening at ground zero and
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:02.360]  the participants of it they were not just your usual participants so we saw
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:07.840]  that the rabbi is a member of the cancer of foreign relations that the guy who was
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:13.400]  the mom there this young Imam was in is himself basically a CIA asset as the
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:19.480]  asset of the US State Department and so they are bringing in also this idea of
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:24.520]  the one world religion and of course to do this they have to destroy the cross
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:29.880]  that's why the cross is not only being destroyed in the speeches of the pope
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:37.160]  because literally to say that basically Jesus was almost a failure by going of
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:41.640]  the cross this is a quite heretical and at the same time we stay there stay
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:45.560]  there yeah we're gonna come back to that and folks missed it the pope didn't even
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:49.200]  have a crucifix behind him when he did it normally speaks to cross behind him
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:53.400]  he said the cross was a failure right price failed Alex go back stay with us
[01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:56.880]  gcn radio network

[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:07.400]  reverting back to the Middle Ages where you had to watch what you said in fear
[01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:11.360]  fines or even violent punishment for example at a so-called free speech
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:15.480]  event in London and anti-ice's piece of art was banned after police demanded the
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:19.840]  artist pay 36,000 pounds for its potentially inflammatory content
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:23.520]  according to event organizers the police made it clear they would pass the
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:27.720]  costs of extra police protection on the artists in the organizers so in other
[01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:31.480]  words if you want to exercise your free speech in the UK you got to cough up a
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:35.320]  lot of money first similarly colleges across the United States are forcing
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:39.080]  students to apply for so-called free speech permits before they can exercise
[01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:42.280]  their first amendment rights on campus that's right the colleges that were
[01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:46.440]  home to anti-vietnam war protests are now demanding that you ask campus
[01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:50.480]  officials for permission to protest to sum it up America is turning into George

[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:44.080]  electricity the insurance the legal all of it and a media operation reaching
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:48.680]  this many people normally would cost about a hundred million dollars a year
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:56.240]  to fund something like Fox News they admit cost about 350 million dollars a
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:34:03.920]  year to run CNN close to that as well MSNBC 200 million plus we're able to fund
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:07.840]  this operation for 15 million dollars a year people go wow you don't need any
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:12.760]  money you got 15 million no no I don't keep 15 million dollars a year it cost
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:18.640]  that the servers alone cost several million dollars a year when you're

[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:48.840]  nutraceutical supplements selling Patriot apparel Hillary for prison t-shirts

[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:03.360]  satellites and TV and the rest of it and that's that's like a million dollars a
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:07.200]  year we got that money in and the money bomb but if we don't spend it just
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:10.200]  exactly right everything then it gets taxed and then you know it's not enough
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:15.000]  money I mean it's it's a nightmare I'm not complaining I want you to know that

[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:32.440]  a few stories up every day so I could show you what I was covering and then I
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:36.320]  personally would make more money but I've taken the money that a big radio
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:41.600]  talk show host makes and I put it into building an operation and it's more
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:44.240]  fruit I mean look at these great reporters look at what we're breaking

[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:13.880]  the face of the New World Order as is our human charter if we serve Christ to
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:18.440]  stand up against evil I mean massive baby harvesting operations you know
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:25.680]  Chimera's half human half animal I mean it's so far worse than we even know it's
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:29.080]  so much more insane all right I'm gonna shut up and go back to Leo Sagami he'll
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:32.520]  be with us 15 minutes the next hour because I got him on late today and to
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:37.520]  take your phone calls Leo Sagami you got cut off about at the break about the
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:41.920]  epic fight the new Cold War what you saw in the meetings what's going on with the
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:45.840]  Pope is there a rebellion against him inside the Vatican who are the factions
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:48.880]  where is it all going and other key points and then we're gonna move the
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:54.480]  calls well to conclude with Putin I must say it's very symbolic the fact that
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:42:01.200]  Hungary is slowly driving towards the Russian direction is supporting Russia
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:05.680]  and we remember Hungary in 1956 they were the ones who rebelled to the Soviet
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:10.880]  Union but this time they see that is better to actually side with Russia that
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:16.080]  to side with the US so I think this move from Hungary is very symbolic also we
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:21.280]  have to understand that Isis is fighting together with neo nazis in Ukraine
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:26.920]  against Russia so what do you expect Putin to do I mean this is a fight which
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:32.400]  is arriving directly on his borders so having closed this Putin parenthesis I
[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:36.280]  want to continue with that TV reporter which I was talking to you about before
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:40.720]  that was done by some friends of mine journalists from a TV show in Italy
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:45.480]  called Piazza Polita what they did was to broadcast it when the Pope left for
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:50.600]  America so he will not be around for the outrage that followed because this
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:55.720]  journalist is Arab journalist that the Italian journalist use camouflage
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:43:00.880]  himself well basically he acted like he was a senior refugee and he followed on
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:06.920]  the exact words of Pope Francis going around the Vatican all the churches the
[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:12.120]  nuns all the congregations knocking on all their doors and with a secret camera
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:16.960]  seeing the reactions well Alex what kind of reaction do you think the Vatican had
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:21.280]  in front of a senior refugee with two kids they probably freaked out slam the
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:28.400]  door on their face absolutely yes and one of them even escaped and the crazy
[01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:33.040]  thing is that on the website of that congregation it said that they welcome
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:38.240]  especially the poor and the care for them instead the reality was very
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:43.640]  different so this guy for a whole day went around the Vatican and showed
[01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:50.080]  Italy that the words that Pope Francis said first in June which basically were
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:54.400]  the words of condemnation towards those people that don't open the door to the
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:59.760]  immigrants you know if they knocked the door we have to open a door well why
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:04.400]  don't they open their door in their churches there there was one place where
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:08.480]  this immigrant went where the Vatican you know how much money they asking they
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:14.760]  asking 300 for an ordinary room and 500 for a deluxe room I mean it's just
[01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:20.000]  unheard of but this TV report created a general outrage amongst the Italian
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:25.440]  population and finally I think people are starting to realize that the lies of
[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:30.320]  Pope Francis also another important aspect of the world things that are
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:35.680]  happening this week is this church that has been set on fire in Bethlehem the
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:41.840]  Church of Saint Charbel by Muslims but the Vatican and also the Palestinian
[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:47.760]  authorities have prohibited to talk about because of course nobody wants
[01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:52.880]  people to know that in the birthplace of Jesus Christ Muslims are setting churches
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:58.280]  on fire so I mean this is the situation today in the world and we are in front of
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:02.800]  this graceful acts thanks to this mongolians this problem is promoted by
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:09.360]  the Pope of course and Obama know the art it really is ridiculous because some
[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:13.520]  of the walls we looked it up at the Vatican or over 200 feet tall their main
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:19.000]  walls about what 50 feet on average it's got private mercenaries from Switzerland
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:23.280]  guarding it for 300 years its tax exempt it owns a hundred and seventy seven
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:27.400]  million acres they admit they have a lot of hidden wealth you're an expert on
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:31.120]  this you've written books on the subject what is the real wealth of the Vatican
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:35.200]  how is it controlled because I looked into it they basically give nothing to
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:40.760]  the poor it is the biggest front ever but he's lecturing American and European
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:45.480]  middle classes that we need to open our doors up as European pensioners are
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:49.360]  being thrown out of their government's subsidized homes they pay for but they
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:54.160]  don't own they're being thrown out to make way for the illegal alien invaders
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:46:01.240]  dubbed the precious darling migrants well of course the the money that the Vatican
[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:06.440]  has is a lot also the gold they have they have especially gold a lot of gold
[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:11.360]  and they have a lot of property around the world imagine all the state the
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:17.800]  Vatican owns is infinite so they are extremely rich and the gold was actually
[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:23.200]  removed from the Vatican bank the moment the moment they had to pass from
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:28.120]  Ratzinger to Pope Francis because now that they have to clarify certain
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:33.720]  positions with the worldwide authorities that were actually taking away
[01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:38.920]  the swift you know the swift system which is this worldwide banking system was
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:45.560]  actually taken away from the Vatican when Pope Ratzinger resigned and was only I
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:50.040]  mean was basically given to back to the Vatican only with the Pope Francis
[01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:54.400]  arrived they could finally have the swift system back into the Vatican Bank it
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:59.280]  was a kind of like blackmail from the banking authorities and in the meantime
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:03.400]  they did the gold that got actually removed so let's be clear that was in
[01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:06.540]  the news but buried in the paper internationally the Vatican had its
[01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:11.920]  banking power threatened and so it literally was coup d'etat by the banking
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:16.200]  and the pedophile Spencer attack to turn it over to Ratzinger and to turn over
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:19.600]  from Ratzinger we ran off to Gandalf Castle I'm serious folks it's called
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:25.440]  Gandalf Castle and then they brought in Francis yeah and the gold got sent to
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:31.320]  Frankfurt to the JP Morgan in Frankfurt so now basically there is not really any
[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:35.880]  gold in the Vatican Bank because it's been moved all abroad so the Italian
[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:40.520]  authority investigative authorities who need to clear these matters don't have
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:46.040]  access well that says it right there I mean the Vatican has been conquered absolutely
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:52.840]  the Vatican is now taken over by these Jesuits who next year in October will
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:59.360]  have their general basically this general gathering from Jesuits coming all
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:05.200]  over the world that will nominate a new Jesuit general so now the moment we have
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:10.240]  Adolf Nikolas he is basically the superior general of the Jesuits with
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:15.600]  together with Pope Francis deal with the the whole Catholic Church and next year
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:21.120]  in October Adolf Nikolas will step down this is another unprecedented moving
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:24.600]  history because the general of the Jesuits was like the Pope he never
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:28.640]  stepped down but this is already the second one that steps down and we will
[01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:34.120]  have a new one coming up so there is a lot going on and next year we will have
[01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:41.880]  a new level of let's say Pope Francis control of the whole thing so let's see
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:47.360]  who is going to place as the Jesuit general in any case as I was saying
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:52.040]  earlier crosses are being destroyed the value of the cross is being destroyed
[01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:56.120]  it's not only the fact that he criticizes Jesus for having gone on the cross he
[01:48:56.120 --> 01:49:04.040]  actually called the cross a vessel simply a symbol and not so important
[01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:07.600]  people say oh he means he failed physically but spiritually won he didn't
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:10.600]  say that he stopped we have the transcript he moved away we'll play it
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:15.040]  again after the break and then go to phone calls but in Satanism they
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:18.760]  desecrate the cross they say it failed they say Christ failed they say he's
[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:23.000]  weak they say he's torn to pieces that's actually I don't want to get into it on
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:27.520]  air but I've studied it that is deep black magic Satanism I mean does the Pope
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:31.960]  know what he was saying when he says Christ failed I mean that is a satanic
[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:36.960]  statement it is a satanic statement that goes with this implementation of a one
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:43.760]  word religion because you can't have the cross in this one word religion as the
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:49.480]  supreme symbol it has to be basically has to put down the cross to put it on
[01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:53.720]  the level of all the other symbols so in the name of ecumenism it all comes
[01:49:53.720 --> 01:50:00.640]  together in the meantime Isis we are the mercenaries of America Israel and the
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:05.480]  Emirates and the whole New World Order are destroying systematically the crosses
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:10.800]  on every church in Iraq and they are prohibiting Christians from practicing
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:14.720]  their faith and now the ACLU is having them pulled off hilltops churches are
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:18.360]  having to pull nativity scenes you can see the total satanic attack on
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:23.240]  Christianity yeah it's it's it's unheard of is I mean it's in front of our eyes
[01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:28.200]  and nobody seems to really realize this then we had the openly gay more rock
[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:35.760]  opening the scriptures at the papal mass made this on square I mean it's a
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:41.280]  little bit like embracing the lobby gay this way we didn't really expect this
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:47.160]  to happen during the pope visit but it up so of course the pope is never gonna
[01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:52.080]  discuss this whole gender issue in the proper way but as people are they're
[01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:55.440]  gonna signal that so all the old ways are being overturned a radical

[01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:15.720]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen broadcasting worldwide I'm your host
[01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:21.880]  Alex Jones Leo Zagami is our guest I have never seen a religious institution
[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:25.400]  we're out in the open promoting world government while our own globalist
[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:30.760]  government our own Anglo-American power access out of Europe in the US is
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:36.920]  funding radical Islam and running ISIS and al-Qaeda and top generals come out a
[01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:40.560]  whole bunch of them the former head of defense intelligence just resigned two
[01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:44.200]  months ago and says yeah we're funding ISIS and al-Qaeda and we told them in the
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:48.360]  White House knows and this is their directive plan and this is just
[01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:54.920]  horrible we're made to fix intelligence to cover it up you can really see it
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:57.960]  because I thought they'd bring in world government with a clash between Islam and
[01:54:57.960 --> 01:55:02.000]  Christendom instead they're gonna bring in political correctness and make
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:07.280]  Christendom submit to Islam that's why I said I was never really an Islam
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:11.440]  basher I saw them being set up the clash of civilizations I saw them as victims
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:15.240]  in Iraq and other areas which I'm still against but that was the setup to
[01:55:15.240 --> 01:55:20.160]  empower the radicals to build them up to weaken Iraq to then take over the whole
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:25.280]  region just like Libya just like overthrowing our allies in Egypt I mean
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:31.560]  this is a diabolical I want to go to phone calls for Will Nick Dan and others
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:39.280]  the toll-free number to talk to Leo Zagami today is 800-259-9231 Leo Zagami
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:43.920]  when I talk about diabolical they're saying ban the name mother and father
[01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:49.480]  they're there's I mean it's just total tyranny how far will you've been in the
[01:55:49.480 --> 01:55:52.180]  secret societies you've been a high-level nation you've been involved with the
[01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:57.240]  Vatican twice turned against it I guess a decade ago when you saw it was evil
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:56:00.560]  you've published 12 books on the subject at the heart of it what is it
[01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:04.960]  because I've been to Bohemian Grove I've covered skull and bones at the at the
[01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:08.320]  bottom of the rabbit hole I found these people are Luciferians they believe
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:13.200]  Lucifer is God Satanist workforum that are into partying and evil and hurting
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:18.120]  folks but at the top aren't they really Luciferians or what have you found yes
[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:25.240]  the New Age cults are all fundamentally Luciferian this rainbow symbol that we
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:31.200]  all you know see these days that was born officially in San Francisco is
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:36.480]  actually the rainbow towards Lucifer and it has a lot of occult symbol is
[01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:45.240]  itself so basically Luciferian these cults are a myriad of various secret
[01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:51.880]  societies that I commonly refer to as of course the Illuminati Network and this
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:56.400]  is probably the easiest way to call them but they are all part of this
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:02.360]  destroying the Christian values destroying the values of Christianity
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:08.360]  to then be able to promote everything that they're doing these days which is
[01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:14.680]  of course unheard of a hundred years ago I mean if a pope like this will come to
[01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:18.480]  America a hundred years ago I think they will throw stones at him or maybe they
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:23.960]  will shoot him because I mean it will be just too much you know for the real
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:29.040]  Christian to see that but people have been made gradually to believe that this
[01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:36.120]  pope is some kind of supernatural being that everything he says is good in
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:41.800]  reality it comes from a philosophy that has been preparing itself for the
[01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:47.880]  takeover for at least 500 years well I gotta tell you I saw some of your
[01:57:47.880 --> 01:57:52.160]  speeches I even read one of your books about five six years ago and I thought
[01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:55.520]  there's no way the Vatican has this much power there's no way the elite want to
[01:57:55.520 --> 01:58:00.640]  put it all in one organization but they're basically it already had a lot
[01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:04.240]  of power they transferred a lot of power to it as an organization so they could
[01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:08.080]  hide it and then now they fully overthrown even that organization and
[01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:11.920]  it's pretty much a dictatorship of whoever controls Pope Francis we're
[01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:15.040]  gonna go to break they have a phone system problem today only three of our

[01:59:43.960 --> 01:59:49.800]  life calm or call 888 253 3139
[01:59:49.800 --> 02:00:08.400]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show big brother mainstream media government
[02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:16.000]  cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:28.320]  network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones from Philadelphia and he
[02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:32.880]  said you know have you heard the pope said that Christ failed at the cross and
[02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:37.960]  I believe the car he never has so Christian so professional so nice it's
[02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:42.520]  it's like Clark Kent or something a black Clark Kent and I said the pope said
[02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:45.360]  that Christ fell in the cross really the corridor and a brain goes yeah he did
[02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:49.400]  you can find the clip and we went and found it but I still just can't believe
[02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:55.640]  it because it's just so ridiculously the attack on Christendom itself I mean if I
[02:00:55.640 --> 02:00:59.760]  had to think of one thing someone who's anti-Christian would do it be attacked
[02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:06.040]  Christ in the cross and I gotta tell you a few things scare me but a man is
[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:12.440]  powerful as the pope with a billion plus followers to actually see it it it's so
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:16.480]  devilish it actually shakes me in my core I want to go to Will Nick Dan Jim and
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:20.800]  Sherry in that order I don't like to admit things shake me but I'm actually
[02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:28.080]  shaken by this pope mr. Zagami it is really apocalyptic the scenario we are
[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:32.160]  leaving and in fact it's very symbolic or actually that Obama maybe the only
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:36.640]  true thing he said today at the United Nations was that ISIS is a apocalyptic
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:45.280]  cult because these groups are made to create the more chaos possible to foment
[02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:51.080]  evil destruction so something will come out of it because they are trying by
[02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:56.640]  doing this to hash up the Antichrist and the coming back of Jesus this is at
[02:01:56.640 --> 02:02:02.600]  least what it seems from from what they're doing and also from what a lot
[02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:06.720]  of researchers have been saying today and in the last few days we had this
[02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:11.960]  particular conjunction of planets how people have been talking about it the
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:17.320]  blood moon the red moon how people have said the what is why is the occult
[02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:22.600]  elite doing all this with this particular conjunction well the elite
[02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:26.920]  follows always astronomy we were talking the other time with you Alex
[02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:32.360]  about the Jesuits and astronomy they're not looking to astronomy the Jesuits in
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:37.320]  the observatories to see some alien creature arriving with his you know a
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:43.520]  machine and whatever they're actually identifying the planets the stars so
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:48.360]  they know when the right conjunctions are in place they can have sharp things
[02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:52.400]  in a certain way this is what they really do with astronomy I want to talk
[02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:56.240]  more about that after calls because exactly I don't believe in it you don't
[02:02:56.240 --> 02:02:59.960]  believe in it they do that's why it's important let's go to will and Rhode
[02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:04.040]  Island you're on there with Leo's economy go ahead yeah my question is for
[02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:08.520]  both of you gentlemen I was just curious at what point do you think that the
[02:03:08.520 --> 02:03:12.040]  Vatican and Christianity became corrupted was it during the Middle Ages
[02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:16.640]  Constantine or do you guys think that Christianity with some of the
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:19.800]  contradictions in the New Testament and the fact that the Gospels were written
[02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:23.840]  maybe 100 years after is just a concoction to kind of mislead us like
[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:27.960]  the government well Christ existed the Romans and Jewish historians wrote about
[02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:32.680]  him there's different perspectives in the three Gospels inspired by God and
[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:35.400]  Christ said there's gonna be a lot of people trying to deceive you so you know
[02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:39.000]  go with your spirit and you know work through that but I think whether it's
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.760]  the Orthodox Church the Catholic Church there's been good there's been bad
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:45.520]  because we're humans it's been a manifestation and it's a larger part of
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:51.040]  God's plan I don't think we can fully understand it Leo well the Vatican has
[02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:56.000]  had problems since the beginning in fact it was actually Saint Benedict to
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:00.920]  walk away from Rome escaped here in the mountains where I'm transmitting from so
[02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:05.600]  he could found more what became monasticism because he founded his
[02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:09.600]  first monastery to escape the corruption in Rome and this was basically
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:13.720]  a long time ago I mean we're talking about 400
[02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:17.840]  sure look what they built the Vatican explain that to people I mean it's
[02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:23.840]  built on a serious serious cultic site sure they what they did basically they
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:28.160]  just picked up the religion that preceded Christianity and they absorb
[02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:34.120]  them in one great cult that's why they are so powerful but at the same time the
[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:38.560]  people who put together this whole machine that they came known after as
[02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:44.360]  the Vatican and even a constant time who gave birth to Christianity knew that
[02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:50.920]  these underground pagan cuts some of the most you know evil ones dedicated to
[02:04:50.920 --> 02:04:56.240]  gods that were really from ancient times like the modern Christians called Satan
[02:04:56.240 --> 02:04:58.880]  or Lucifer stay there let's talk about it when we come back good call
[02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:04.040]  Daniels info wars.com Russian President Vladimir Putin said the US's effort to
[02:05:04.040 --> 02:05:08.160]  fund train and support ISIS and other jihadist rebels in a proxy war against
[02:05:08.160 --> 02:05:12.840]  Syria violates international law he told CBS that in his opinion provision of
[02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:16.400]  military support to illegal structures runs counter to the principles of
[02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:20.280]  modern international law in the United Nations Charter he also pointed out that
[02:05:20.280 --> 02:05:23.720]  Assad's army is fighting against terrorist organizations and not secular
[02:05:23.720 --> 02:05:27.680]  rebels even the New York Times agrees with them back in 2013 the newspaper
[02:05:27.680 --> 02:05:31.400]  reported that the majority of the rebels in Syria have sworn allegiance to ISIS
[02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:34.760]  there's not a secular fighting force against Assad to speak of. Basel
[02:05:34.760 --> 02:05:38.800]  address a commander of a rebel brigade in Syria said that his brigade was
[02:05:38.800 --> 02:05:42.400]  collaborating with the Islamic State and the news were front by attacking the
[02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:47.400]  Syrian armies gatherings in Calamune and the Pentagon even admitted in 2012 that
[02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:51.000]  NATO was backing ISIS and other jihadist groups in an effort to topple Assad

[02:07:10.840 --> 02:07:14.520]  something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years the
[02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:19.000]  federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine accrued form
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:22.560]  of it be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that

[02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:41.320]  lines are up and working here in just a moment
[02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:45.640]  Leo Zagami's book is available in English you can find it on amazon you name it
[02:08:45.640 --> 02:08:52.120]  the last pope Leo Zagami he's written 11 other books as well
[02:08:52.120 --> 02:08:55.960]  and he has accurately predicted exactly what would happen
[02:08:55.960 --> 02:08:58.840]  that they would have the pope resign that they would put a jesuit in they
[02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:03.880]  never had a pope resign and this was a takeover and he lives
[02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:08.840]  right there in Italy he's been working inside the Vatican for decades
[02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:12.200]  he's been part of secret societies that are within the Vatican
[02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:16.120]  and it's just unprecedented this is the big sign that world government's coming
[02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:21.640]  in last night I went out with friends downtown to a pool
[02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:25.560]  buy some condos to barbecue and see the blood moon there was too many clouds
[02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:27.640]  really see it I've seen one of the others this year
[02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:32.280]  it's pretty spectacular a full eclipse the moon yeah five in one year
[02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:37.240]  won't even see another one till 2033 but waiting for it to happen I had folks
[02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:41.640]  out there who I didn't know at the pool arguing with me saying no
[02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:44.840]  it's Jewish mysticism it's the you know maybe the end of the world the start of
[02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:48.440]  the tribulation had folks on the elevator arguing
[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:51.800]  with me and of course I have the news blaming me saying I said the blood
[02:09:51.800 --> 02:09:55.720]  moons were the end of the world in the Schmiede I never said any of that
[02:09:55.720 --> 02:10:00.840]  just like I never said jade helm was the end of America or gun
[02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:04.840]  confiscations it was further conditioning like TSA on the streets
[02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:07.800]  but this is how they lie and misrepresent but I gotta tell you I've
[02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:12.600]  been on air 20 years I've never seen the media lie like they lie now
[02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:15.960]  I mean they will really lie they'll get up on the news and say everyone loves the
[02:10:15.960 --> 02:10:21.720]  pope he's not political people shouldn't criticize him just lock step both parties
[02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:25.960]  when the truth is most Catholics I talk to are are horrified
[02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:29.960]  are horrified but but now is it okay to say christ
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:35.320]  failure on the cross now is that okay I want to go back to your calls
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:40.440]  with mr Zagami Nick in Tennessee you're on the air go ahead
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:45.560]  hey Leo I want to know your thoughts on the question did the Roman Empire
[02:10:45.560 --> 02:10:50.520]  never fall and just became the Vatican thanks
[02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:54.120]  I think I partly answered this question before because
[02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:58.360]  definitely it is like the listener said
[02:10:58.360 --> 02:11:03.960]  a continuation of the Roman Empire that then became the sacred Roman Empire but
[02:11:03.960 --> 02:11:08.920]  in any case the Vatican has kept that core of knowledge
[02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:12.120]  that was there since the ancient times since the times
[02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:15.560]  even Julius Caesar got together with Cleopatra I mean
[02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:20.680]  Rome has this occult knowledge and the Jesuits make it really clear
[02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:24.760]  I wrote an article about it for info wars called
[02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:29.400]  describing Jesuitenberg these caves near the city of Maastricht
[02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:35.560]  a built by Jesuits which basically include a variety of gods from all the
[02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:39.720]  traditions worshiped by the Jesuits in their spare time
[02:11:39.720 --> 02:11:44.680]  it took a hundred years to build these caves and what is inside there
[02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:49.880]  is much more astonishing than any logic and find around the world I mean is
[02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:54.040]  incredible the imagery the detail and everything was
[02:11:54.040 --> 02:11:57.800]  done by the Jesuits who conducted until 1960
[02:11:57.800 --> 02:12:03.560]  rituals in these caves and now are as possible to visit them if you book
[02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:06.520]  sure let me try to answer that question for Nick
[02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:10.200]  after the official fall of Rome and the final sacking
[02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:14.760]  and 410 by the Visigoth chieftain Allerich Rome then switched because it
[02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:20.120]  had been the eastern western empire switched totally to Constantinople
[02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:24.520]  which is now Istanbul today in Turkey and the church
[02:12:24.520 --> 02:12:27.960]  gave its allegiance and vice versa to the Byzantines
[02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:31.640]  in 800 with the crowning of Charlemagne by the pope
[02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:35.560]  and the ancient roman term Europa or the goddess Europa
[02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:39.480]  then Rome gave its power to Europa or Europe
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:42.360]  and that's the switch and then the rebirth truly
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:45.720]  of the Roman Empire under the holy Roman Empire
[02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:50.680]  correct Leo Zagami correct that we go into the 1950s and we arrive
[02:12:50.680 --> 02:12:55.160]  basically to the Treaty of Rome and to the modern European Union
[02:12:55.160 --> 02:12:59.480]  that is an emanation of this sacred Roman Empire which is a project of the
[02:12:59.480 --> 02:13:03.160]  Catholic Church post-World War II and this project
[02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:07.800]  wants to amplify itself of course taking over also the U.S.
[02:13:07.800 --> 02:13:11.720]  the rest of the world in this one world
[02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:15.320]  government and since you've been in the in the in the
[02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:18.440]  what you call the light side of the Illuminati in the Vatican which there's
[02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:20.920]  all these Illuminati systems around the world but you're you're confirmed in
[02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:24.120]  that the photos the the admissions I mean they admit that you've been part of
[02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:27.160]  their group as a family ties you believe it was for good for the light you
[02:13:27.160 --> 02:13:30.440]  thought it was bad went public so people can't judge you
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:34.360]  there is supposedly the whole Rosicrucian, Merovingian,
[02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:38.760]  secreted Lannish breeding programs of the Masons
[02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:43.160]  and George Washington and all the rest of them to get over here
[02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:46.600]  and to get away from the Vatican that they believe had corrupted the ultimate
[02:13:46.600 --> 02:13:50.280]  gain to to to to empower humanity and that
[02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:53.160]  they were the real Illuminati led by Thomas Jefferson
[02:13:53.160 --> 02:13:55.960]  who then of course helped engineer the French Revolution and all that mass
[02:13:55.960 --> 02:13:58.440]  murder but he then turned against it and said it was wrong
[02:13:58.440 --> 02:14:01.720]  Washington fought it from the beginning so
[02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:04.920]  so what about the New Atlantis versus Rome
[02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:11.080]  hasn't the New Atlantis America and the goddess Columbia
[02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:14.680]  hasn't that been at odds with the Vatican and Europa
[02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:17.960]  two different cults or is it really the same cult?
[02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:21.960]  Well as you know the Jesuits came around
[02:14:21.960 --> 02:14:25.640]  more or less 500 years ago with the Niazzurio
[02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:33.240]  and the the the whole reason to be the Jesuits was to actually infiltrate
[02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:36.920]  the growing dissent for the Catholic Church
[02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:42.040]  of what became known as Protestantism all those people who thought they were
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:45.240]  rebelling in the end they will be infiltrated
[02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:48.600]  and one thing about the Jesuits they don't infiltrate
[02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:53.480]  a cult a religion to deactivate it they simply take it over
[02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:59.080]  and and so they I mean they take over maybe the Christian evangelical church
[02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:03.560]  as they take over the satanic one for them the important thing is to take over
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:09.560]  every single human creed. That's right but separately a lot of Protestants don't
[02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:12.600]  know that the Rosicrucians and other people
[02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:16.360]  were deeply behind creating the whole Protestant movement
[02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:19.960]  and it looks like there was a battle against the Catholic Church
[02:15:19.960 --> 02:15:23.960]  at one point which they would say was evil and then the Jesuits didn't
[02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:26.600]  go try to defeat that to save the Catholic Church
[02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:30.040]  they actually took it over and then took over the Catholic Church and now want
[02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:35.000]  to control both wings of the system. They also infiltrated the Rosicrucians
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:38.600]  the Rosicrucians were actually good at one point when some of them
[02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:43.160]  also devised you know based on the new Atlantis of Sir Francis Bacon the
[02:15:43.160 --> 02:15:47.320]  idea also that came into life with 1776 with the
[02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:51.560]  foundation of the United States of America this idea of freedom
[02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:55.640]  from the other side you know. Exactly but George Washington
[02:15:55.640 --> 02:15:59.320]  smelled it out double crossed the Illuminati and that's why America got
[02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:02.520]  at least for about a hundred years it's shot.
[02:16:02.520 --> 02:16:07.720]  Yeah the chaos was of course created the moment you rebelled to this system
[02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:11.800]  but they are always in the midst you see and they manage
[02:16:11.800 --> 02:16:16.120]  the Rosicrucian tradition at one point Elias Ashmore who was
[02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:19.320]  in the 16th were one of the maximum representatives
[02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:23.400]  he said that these Rosicrucians were getting infiltrated by which doctors
[02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:27.640]  by which craft and this witchcraft came from the Jesuits you know
[02:16:27.640 --> 02:16:32.040]  they went basically to those true Christian mystics that wanted
[02:16:32.040 --> 02:16:36.040]  the something that brought them closer to God and offered them
[02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:39.000]  instead a diabolical creed that could bring them
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:42.920]  immediate. Sure exactly the original Rosicrucians
[02:16:42.920 --> 02:16:46.360]  undoubtedly really were about human empowerment the opposite of Satanism
[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:49.560]  or Luciferianism and that's why they had to be taken over and then what we
[02:16:49.560 --> 02:16:53.160]  think it was Rosicrucians today is just Satanism.
[02:16:53.160 --> 02:16:56.920]  Yes because the Rosicrucian manifesto that was
[02:16:56.920 --> 02:17:00.600]  basically published in the 1620s by this guy Colander
[02:17:00.600 --> 02:17:04.360]  was actually completely opposed to the Vatican and attacked
[02:17:04.360 --> 02:17:07.400]  very harshly the Vatican and this manifesto
[02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:10.600]  were actually put in various cities in northern Europe
[02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:15.080]  creating a lot of interest towards this new
[02:17:15.080 --> 02:17:18.920]  new actually there was a crucian claim to be very old tradition
[02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:23.000]  there was a crucian claim to basically be those original high priests that were
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:27.480]  rebelling to this system that was taken over by the Vatican.
[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:31.640]  Nick do you have anything else you'd like to add listening on 1600 a.m.
[02:17:31.640 --> 02:17:37.160]  I think so well I've heard stuff about the council and I see
[02:17:37.160 --> 02:17:41.720]  or how you pronounce that word you know a lot of Christianity was changed
[02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:46.600]  like it was possible that Jesus Christ himself was a vegan
[02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:50.520]  and the Roman Empire whatever you want to call it changed a lot of
[02:17:50.520 --> 02:17:54.360]  Christianity's pure teachings into something totally different to fit their
[02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:59.000]  doctrine so what are your thoughts. Well you know they found a lot of the
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:03.160]  ancient scrolls from the scribes and the King James pretty much
[02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:06.920]  matches up from what I've seen but some whole books
[02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:10.200]  that they didn't agree with did get disappeared I don't think the text itself
[02:18:10.200 --> 02:18:14.040]  has been manipulated that much but their whole books that disappeared you
[02:18:14.040 --> 02:18:18.040]  Leo. Yes yeah they decided to destroy approximately
[02:18:18.040 --> 02:18:23.800]  500 books that talked about the life of Jesus because it didn't fit
[02:18:23.800 --> 02:18:29.320]  with the system. Of course if the book was showing
[02:18:29.320 --> 02:18:34.600]  Jesus that was rebellious to society was somebody
[02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:38.840]  could challenge the empire or in a way that they disliked
[02:18:38.840 --> 02:18:43.880]  or maybe was teaching some secret knowledge that they didn't want to
[02:18:43.880 --> 02:18:47.000]  give to the public they just took this book away.
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:50.760]  I mean definitely there has been at least
[02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:55.960]  officially a few but maybe many more books that were completely destroyed at
[02:18:55.960 --> 02:18:59.160]  that time and remember that for hundreds of years
[02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:04.360]  only the people from the church were capable of reading these books
[02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:08.760]  because the majority of people in society were not capable of reading
[02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:13.640]  so only the aristocrats and the church had this knowledge. Now to bring us back to
[02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:16.840]  that today the complete dumbing down thank you Nick great questions we're
[02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:20.280]  skipping this network break only this one. Dan in Illinois you're on the
[02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:22.440]  ear.
[02:19:26.120 --> 02:19:31.800]  Okay we'll come back. Yeah yeah go ahead. Yes this is Bible Dan with the Bible in
[02:19:31.800 --> 02:19:37.720]  his hand and I ran into Jakarta Jackson and Paul
[02:19:37.720 --> 02:19:43.880]  Joseph Watson at the Washington train station in disguise.
[02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:47.560]  So I'll let you know that the video I'm going to post
[02:19:47.560 --> 02:19:51.720]  of Paul Joseph Watson is in England so that's not true you mean
[02:19:51.720 --> 02:19:57.080]  you mean David Knight and Jakarta Jackson. Yeah David Knight David Knight the
[02:19:57.080 --> 02:20:00.200]  guy with the beard mustache. Sure if you got a serious question go ahead and go
[02:20:00.200 --> 02:20:05.560]  to it sir. All right I got two. What is the pope
[02:20:05.560 --> 02:20:10.280]  talking about saying that government officials
[02:20:10.280 --> 02:20:17.160]  can oppose gay licenses. He just said essentially
[02:20:17.160 --> 02:20:25.080]  Tim Davis was right to deny gay licenses to gays and in my second
[02:20:25.080 --> 02:20:31.240]  question the Da Vinci Code. Essentially Constantine
[02:20:31.240 --> 02:20:35.960]  knew that the church Christianity was going to take over so
[02:20:35.960 --> 02:20:39.960]  what he did was he created the office of pope
[02:20:39.960 --> 02:20:45.640]  but the pope is really the emperor.
[02:20:45.640 --> 02:20:49.560]  Is that correct? I appreciate your call Dan.
[02:20:49.560 --> 02:20:53.000]  Let me go to Leo Zagami to try to answer that. First of all I just want to say
[02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:57.800]  this. Looking at this and I'm not trying to
[02:20:57.800 --> 02:21:00.360]  give this pope a pass but I don't want to be sitting here judging people being
[02:21:00.360 --> 02:21:03.800]  nasty which I have been because I'm so threatened by all this and it's just so
[02:21:03.800 --> 02:21:07.240]  obviously over the top. Is the media cherry picking what the
[02:21:07.240 --> 02:21:10.360]  pope says? I'm trying to read more of what he says because he will say hey gay
[02:21:10.360 --> 02:21:14.440]  marriage hurts the family. Hey people have a right to conscience to
[02:21:14.440 --> 02:21:17.160]  say no. Hey radicalism is doing some bad
[02:21:17.160 --> 02:21:20.040]  stuff. Hey the family is important but then it
[02:21:20.040 --> 02:21:23.320]  seems like he says these horrible things too that the media picks up and
[02:21:23.320 --> 02:21:27.160]  magnifies. So he is saying these bad things but then I find out he says some
[02:21:27.160 --> 02:21:31.240]  good things as well but then that stuff doesn't get picked up so it is very
[02:21:31.240 --> 02:21:34.600]  juwitical. I guess that's what the Jesuits do
[02:21:34.600 --> 02:21:37.640]  is they talk on both sides of their mouth or what's going on Leo Zagami and
[02:21:37.640 --> 02:21:42.200]  then his whole question about Constantine. Well they just give a little
[02:21:42.200 --> 02:21:45.480]  he just gives a little bone here and there you know to satisfy the
[02:21:45.480 --> 02:21:48.520]  conservatives and the growing dissent that is in
[02:21:48.520 --> 02:21:51.080]  the church. I mean this morning the newspapers in
[02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:53.480]  Italy were talking about the fact that the pope
[02:21:53.480 --> 02:21:57.320]  has not said anything about the gay marriages in the US and that he hasn't
[02:21:57.320 --> 02:22:01.720]  opposed anything and actually the way of this pope is basically
[02:22:01.720 --> 02:22:06.600]  oh well let's see what we agree on and not what we disagree on
[02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:11.160]  and we should just not point so much on the complex doctrines
[02:22:11.160 --> 02:22:15.160]  but on the beauty of Jesus and that's it. When he says that then he can say
[02:22:15.160 --> 02:22:18.440]  anything and people believe him. Then he says that Jesus failed. He said Jesus
[02:22:18.440 --> 02:22:21.640]  has failure. Yeah well he says Jesus has a failure
[02:22:21.640 --> 02:22:25.480]  when it does you know when he wants but then when he suits him he says
[02:22:25.480 --> 02:22:29.800]  he said that we shouldn't look at the complex doctrine but just the beauty
[02:22:29.800 --> 02:22:33.640]  of Jesus. So Jesus is this beautiful finger that
[02:22:33.640 --> 02:22:37.400]  I don't know but it's not anymore it doesn't have any of the values.
[02:22:37.400 --> 02:22:40.360]  For folks that don't know in the real satanic masses that they've
[02:22:40.360 --> 02:22:44.120]  had for over a thousand years they talk about Christ broken defeated
[02:22:44.120 --> 02:22:48.040]  failing at the cross dead. I mean when I saw him the look in his eyes when he
[02:22:48.040 --> 02:22:51.400]  said that I got chills. I mean it was he's not stupid he
[02:22:51.400 --> 02:22:55.640]  knows exactly what that was and that was hard core.
[02:22:55.640 --> 02:22:59.480]  Sure and you know you mentioned Castel Gandalf and that's
[02:22:59.480 --> 02:23:03.320]  the place near there where they actually do the satanic masses
[02:23:03.320 --> 02:23:07.560]  with with all these priests the satanic sects the
[02:23:07.560 --> 02:23:13.800]  all gathering these forests and maybe one day if we are lucky enough Alex
[02:23:13.800 --> 02:23:18.040]  we can spot them as you did with the Bohemian Grove.
[02:23:18.040 --> 02:23:22.440]  Of course if we are caught by these people I think that we will really end
[02:23:22.440 --> 02:23:26.600]  up badly. There will be no coming back
[02:23:26.600 --> 02:23:31.240]  because there is actually Catholic priest that celebrates satanic masses and
[02:23:31.240 --> 02:23:35.800]  this is not us saying it is Padre Amor who is the chief
[02:23:35.800 --> 02:23:39.720]  exorcist of the Vatican. He has clearly stated
[02:23:39.720 --> 02:23:43.560]  that there is satanic sets operating in the Vatican.
[02:23:43.560 --> 02:23:47.640]  So I mean if the chief exorcist of the Vatican says this
[02:23:47.640 --> 02:23:51.640]  why can't we say that? I hear you unbelievable.
[02:23:51.640 --> 02:23:55.320]  Jim in Montana you're on the air with Leo Zagami go ahead.
[02:23:55.320 --> 02:24:02.600]  Yes Alex say I'm a preacher evangelist and I'm 62 years old and I was born
[02:24:02.600 --> 02:24:07.160]  and raised a Catholic back then at birth and I was born and raised in
[02:24:07.160 --> 02:24:10.360]  Detroit, Michigan. I hear there's Catholic church.
[02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:15.400]  Catholic grade school and high school education. I understand you're Catholic go ahead.
[02:24:15.400 --> 02:24:21.160]  Yes and I'm also a preacher evangelist you know what I'm wondering is what
[02:24:21.160 --> 02:24:26.520]  happened to the name above all names which is
[02:24:26.520 --> 02:24:30.520]  Adonai Yeshua Messiah Yeshua is his name
[02:24:30.520 --> 02:24:34.760]  why are we using this name Jesus and why is it Catholic Church
[02:24:34.760 --> 02:24:40.040]  involved in pushing this garbage my entire life.
[02:24:40.040 --> 02:24:44.760]  I don't understand. No I hear you and God bless you you know my feeling on this
[02:24:44.760 --> 02:24:47.560]  and I'm not saying you're being a Pharisee I understand your frustration.
[02:24:47.560 --> 02:24:52.120]  Language has changed things happen you know the name Jesus is different
[02:24:52.120 --> 02:24:55.080]  in different languages we all know who we're talking about I don't think God
[02:24:55.080 --> 02:24:58.840]  hates us if we get it wrong. You're right Yeshua
[02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:03.560]  you know the name of God you could say Jehovah I am that I am we all know who
[02:25:03.560 --> 02:25:06.680]  we're talking about we all know the fruits of that God we
[02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:10.680]  know the fruits of the devil and the new world order brings us
[02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:15.000]  bad fruit God brings us prosperity but the paradox is we get so much prosperity
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:18.200]  as Christians we then become degenerate and decadent
[02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:21.560]  I don't know how we transcend that paradox that God blesses us so much
[02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:29.880]  Liam. God blesses us and at the same time is testing us every day
[02:25:29.880 --> 02:25:33.720]  and of course having a pope like this is testing
[02:25:33.720 --> 02:25:38.920]  all of the one of everybody who thinks of himself as a Christian because after
[02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:43.320]  saying certain things you can't really say that this pope is actually a
[02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:46.840]  Christian. It's interesting that we are going
[02:25:46.840 --> 02:25:50.120]  through that passage these days a lot of people are
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:54.440]  mentioned that passage from the Bible in Acts 2 20 in Revelation 6
[02:25:54.440 --> 02:26:00.360]  12 which mentions this moon that becomes blood in this
[02:26:00.360 --> 02:26:04.440]  particular period of time in which a great earthquake that could have been
[02:26:04.440 --> 02:26:09.000]  of course the one we just had in Chile and maybe this is the event the pope
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:13.000]  openly saying Christ fell at the cross total blasphemy maybe that's the big
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:16.920]  maybe it is signaling some new horrid march into evil
[02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:20.600]  maybe the people who actually for a long time talked about prophecies they are
[02:26:20.600 --> 02:26:25.080]  completely right that's the truth
[02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:27.800]  yeah maybe we're here they just announced their brain shipping the troops
[02:26:27.800 --> 02:26:31.640]  that's in the mainstream news I mean it's all I want to do five more minutes
[02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:35.000]  for the other side I know you got to go I want to talk about the astrology and
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:38.840]  how they're into that and the Vatican Observatory that I stayed right next to
[02:26:38.840 --> 02:26:42.440]  at a hotel while I was there in Rome at least two of the days
[02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:45.080]  because I wanted to be able to oversee what was happening and try to
[02:26:45.080 --> 02:26:49.160]  investigate some areas but let's continue with the phone
[02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:52.680]  calls it's just a very epic time to be alive and even if you don't believe
[02:26:52.680 --> 02:26:56.440]  solar eclipses have important portents the elites do folks that's why we're
[02:26:56.440 --> 02:26:59.320]  looking at it you know it's like saying that some South
[02:26:59.320 --> 02:27:02.520]  Islanders go out and head hunt on the full moon doesn't mean we believe in
[02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:06.360]  head hunting it just means these people from their anthropology their
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:11.480]  sociology do this on full moons and well the elite are into astrology as
[02:27:11.480 --> 02:27:15.960]  well and do weird stuff sherry in texas you're on the year
[02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:19.240]  thank you alex my questions about the fact that
[02:27:19.240 --> 02:27:24.520]  that I don't think the pope said that christ was a failure I think that's
[02:27:24.520 --> 02:27:29.800]  media spin that said that no I mean I mean hold on he said he bodily failed
[02:27:29.800 --> 02:27:33.320]  as a human he shows that that's clear in the bible
[02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:36.840]  so it's saying he failed but his message did something later it is a twisting
[02:27:36.840 --> 02:27:40.520]  but sorry go ahead I think christ thought he was a
[02:27:40.520 --> 02:27:44.280]  failure because can you not agree mr. so gony
[02:27:44.280 --> 02:27:48.840]  that in our humanity I like the pope like christ said our
[02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:52.360]  humanness I mean the pope said about our humanness
[02:27:52.360 --> 02:27:59.000]  that in our humanity we lack confidence our humanity is tim timorous
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:03.320]  we have a hard time believing in ourselves christ is not us
[02:28:03.320 --> 02:28:06.600]  christ said to god why have you forgotten forsaken me
[02:28:06.600 --> 02:28:10.840]  he really thought he was a failure and that's so human in the secret that's
[02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:14.120]  what he's in the garden realizing he's about to get beat to death and tortured
[02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:17.560]  and you're right his flesh feels like he's been left alone then he guts up
[02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:20.200]  he goes through it and transcends it
[02:28:20.200 --> 02:28:26.520]  leo but Alex the the pope didn't only put the cross into question in that
[02:28:26.520 --> 02:28:31.720]  passage the cross is the victory he actually said that the cross is only a
[02:28:31.720 --> 02:28:34.920]  vessel I mean saying that the cross is only
[02:28:34.920 --> 02:28:40.200]  a vessel so it's only a symbol means destroying the whole of christianity
[02:28:40.200 --> 02:28:44.040]  I mean the cross is the symbol of the sacrifice that you
[02:28:44.040 --> 02:28:47.480]  do with your own life with your own belief
[02:28:47.480 --> 02:28:51.320]  every day every minute of the day I mean the cross is essential for a christian
[02:28:51.320 --> 02:28:54.040]  so I wouldn't put this into question at all
[02:28:54.040 --> 02:28:57.000]  well ma'am I'm not attacking you I'm gonna pull the full transcript he does
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:01.000]  say it in a twisted way so I can see what you're saying but I've watched it
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.960]  like five times I'm gonna pull the full transcript back in here
[02:29:03.960 --> 02:29:07.640]  jacari jackson just is so hot to talk about it he's not taking a few days off
[02:29:07.640 --> 02:29:11.240]  he's worked like 10 days straight he's coming in to co-host with kit daniels
[02:29:11.240 --> 02:29:14.200]  in the fourth hour to go over all this but uh
[02:29:14.200 --> 02:29:18.920]  and leon macadam sorry go ahead there is even journalists here in Italy I mean
[02:29:18.920 --> 02:29:22.840]  I'm talking about some of the most specialized Catholics and Vaticanies that
[02:29:22.840 --> 02:29:26.920]  are saying the same thing as macadam said so I mean it's not only him who says
[02:29:26.920 --> 02:29:31.480]  it they're saying it also here in Italy Vaticanies to the experts so
[02:29:31.480 --> 02:29:34.360]  you're saying folks are saying the same thing our reporters are saying
[02:29:34.360 --> 02:29:37.400]  absolutely yes ma'am I'm gonna let you come back
[02:29:37.400 --> 02:29:40.680]  this is just too important we're gonna go to robert bob j mick after that then
[02:29:40.680 --> 02:29:43.000]  let our guests go and then I'm gonna continue with the news we haven't had
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:48.040]  yet I'm Alex Jones info wars dot com spread the word
[02:29:48.040 --> 02:29:51.960]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:51.960 --> 02:29:58.760]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:58.760 --> 02:30:02.920]  kit daniels info wars dot com when it comes to free speech
[02:30:02.920 --> 02:30:06.360]  the entire world is reverting back to the middle ages where you had to watch
[02:30:06.360 --> 02:30:10.280]  what you said in fear of fines or even violent punishment for example at a
[02:30:10.280 --> 02:30:14.360]  so-called free speech event in london an anti-isis piece of art was banned
[02:30:14.360 --> 02:30:18.440]  after police demanded the artist pay 36 000 pounds for its potentially
[02:30:18.440 --> 02:30:22.600]  inflammatory content according to event organizers so police made it clear
[02:30:22.600 --> 02:30:26.360]  they would pass the cost of extra police protection on the artists and the
[02:30:26.360 --> 02:30:29.960]  organizers so in other words if you want to exercise your free speech in the
[02:30:29.960 --> 02:30:32.440]  uk you got to cough up a lot of money first
[02:30:32.440 --> 02:30:36.280]  similarly colleges across the united states are forcing students to apply for
[02:30:36.280 --> 02:30:39.720]  so-called free speech permits before they can exercise their first amendment
[02:30:39.720 --> 02:30:42.920]  rights on campus that's right the colleges that were home to
[02:30:42.920 --> 02:30:46.840]  anti-vietnam war protests are now demanding that you ask campus officials
[02:30:46.840 --> 02:30:50.520]  for permission to protest to sum it up america is turning into george

[02:33:02.520 --> 02:33:07.480]  we are on the march the empire is on the run
[02:33:07.480 --> 02:33:19.960]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:33:19.960 --> 02:33:23.160]  all right here's the full quote out of the washington post
[02:33:23.160 --> 02:33:30.440]  of the pubs full speech the cross shows us a different way of measuring
[02:33:30.440 --> 02:33:34.040]  success ours is to plant the seeds god
[02:33:34.040 --> 02:33:40.280]  sees to the fruits of our labors and if at times our efforts and work seem to
[02:33:40.280 --> 02:33:44.200]  fail and produce no fruit we need to remember that we are followers of
[02:33:44.200 --> 02:33:48.120]  jesus and his life humanly speaking ended in
[02:33:48.120 --> 02:33:52.680]  failure the failure of the cross so that's stated with a twisted
[02:33:52.680 --> 02:33:55.960]  deep meaning that really informed people would understand
[02:33:55.960 --> 02:33:58.920]  you could see a failure if you were there that day but it created a great
[02:33:58.920 --> 02:34:05.000]  success he doesn't say that knowing to the unwashed masses
[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:08.840]  price failed at the cross which is the inversion
[02:34:08.840 --> 02:34:14.040]  of the entire of christendom that the cross is the great victory
[02:34:16.040 --> 02:34:21.800]  it is just over the top he goes on and other danger comes when we become
[02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:25.080]  jealous of our free time when we think that
[02:34:25.080 --> 02:34:28.600]  surrounding ourselves with worldly compass will keep us and serve us
[02:34:28.600 --> 02:34:30.600]  better and that's his attack for austerity
[02:34:30.600 --> 02:34:33.960]  yes it's good to be poor in the service of the poor if that's what you choose
[02:34:33.960 --> 02:34:37.800]  but it's also good to be successful and lift others up and have prosperity i
[02:34:37.800 --> 02:34:41.800]  mean i've read the bible the problem with this reasoning is it can be blunt
[02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:47.480]  the power of god's daily call to conversion to encounter with him
[02:34:47.480 --> 02:34:51.880]  just goes on with a bunch of socialist gobbledygook
[02:34:51.880 --> 02:34:55.800]  and that's what leo zegami uh was getting at but but look he's calling for
[02:34:55.800 --> 02:34:59.560]  world government he's calling for global carbon taxes
[02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:02.840]  that are a death sentence to many of the third world i mean this is the whole
[02:35:02.840 --> 02:35:07.240]  globalist project and they had another pope stepped
[02:35:07.240 --> 02:35:11.320]  down to have him come take over this is unprecedented
[02:35:11.320 --> 02:35:13.960]  and never had there been a jesuit pope because you weren't supposed to have a
[02:35:13.960 --> 02:35:16.920]  jesuit pope because it was supposed to be the watchdog
[02:35:16.920 --> 02:35:20.600]  for the catholic church zegami i want to take a few final calls with you i
[02:35:20.600 --> 02:35:24.040]  appreciate all your time but talk a little bit about
[02:35:24.040 --> 02:35:27.560]  the the jesuits founded by the you know military officer
[02:35:27.560 --> 02:35:31.400]  uh in spain in portugal liola all of that
[02:35:31.400 --> 02:35:34.680]  and because i have some catholics email me calling they go who says you can't
[02:35:34.680 --> 02:35:37.880]  have a jesuit pope well why was there never one before then i want to get
[02:35:37.880 --> 02:35:41.000]  into the astrology and a few final phone calls
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:45.400]  well there was never really a written rule but it was an unsaid rule
[02:35:45.400 --> 02:35:50.680]  a few years back i remember in a forum of jesuits this question arise and of
[02:35:50.680 --> 02:35:54.920]  course they said it's an unwritten rule but we don't usually traditionally have
[02:35:54.920 --> 02:35:59.480]  a jesuit pope this was a as i said a few years back
[02:35:59.480 --> 02:36:02.920]  it's interesting i think in all of this context
[02:36:02.920 --> 02:36:05.960]  the prophecies that were given by a nun called
[02:36:05.960 --> 02:36:10.600]  n katerina americ because the prophecies of this nun
[02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:15.080]  i want to just mention a little passage to to make understand how accurate they
[02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:18.520]  are i saw also the relationship between two
[02:36:18.520 --> 02:36:22.840]  popes i saw how baleful will be the consequences
[02:36:22.840 --> 02:36:26.840]  of this false church i saw it increases in size
[02:36:26.840 --> 02:36:29.800]  eretics of every kind came into the city of rome
[02:36:29.800 --> 02:36:33.960]  the local cregy glue luke warm i saw a great darkness
[02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:38.200]  this was a nun that was almost made a saint by the catholic church and is a
[02:36:38.200 --> 02:36:42.520]  biata which is an in-between stage when you are nearly getting to sainthood
[02:36:42.520 --> 02:36:46.920]  so it's not the words of those are german nun right like 400 years ago
[02:36:46.920 --> 02:36:50.200]  this uh this well she was basically born
[02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:56.280]  at the exact between she was born in 1774 and she died in 1824
[02:36:56.280 --> 02:37:00.600]  and she was very important for her visions the church
[02:37:00.600 --> 02:37:06.440]  so as very important and she said the church is in great danger we must pray
[02:37:06.440 --> 02:37:10.600]  you know and and she saw this i mean it's quite incredible that she saw the
[02:37:10.600 --> 02:37:14.520]  scenario of the two popes like we are having these days i mean it's
[02:37:14.520 --> 02:37:18.440]  shocking well all i know is
[02:37:18.440 --> 02:37:22.520]  whether it's the universities or whether it's the the protestant church all of
[02:37:22.520 --> 02:37:24.600]  it is now just promoting world government
[02:37:24.600 --> 02:37:28.840]  promoting the end of the family i mean i've gone to family churches that were
[02:37:28.840 --> 02:37:32.760]  kind of mainline methodists that now sound like a soviet brainwashing camp
[02:37:32.760 --> 02:37:35.400]  i mean i've gone to baptist churches that sound
[02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:39.480]  a conservative that now sound liberal uh and they're just following their central
[02:37:39.480 --> 02:37:44.360]  directives world council of churches 501c3 government controlled
[02:37:44.360 --> 02:37:48.200]  it is bad i mean it and now i know folks in this different psychology
[02:37:48.200 --> 02:37:51.800]  departments of universities it's like we're banning free speech
[02:37:51.800 --> 02:37:55.720]  whites are inherently evil this is white people saying this uh
[02:37:55.720 --> 02:37:59.960]  i mean it is it is they are really making a totalitarian move
[02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:03.640]  to crush the west uh a do you agree with that and then b
[02:38:03.640 --> 02:38:09.000]  why does the elite want to crush the west the source of their power
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:13.880]  well because the next source of the power has to be at a global level so they
[02:38:13.880 --> 02:38:17.320]  don't care if they crash a specific culture
[02:38:17.320 --> 02:38:20.600]  because they want to promote their mondialist culture
[02:38:20.600 --> 02:38:27.080]  so uh of course they crashed nationalism as well as they crash religious identity
[02:38:27.080 --> 02:38:31.320]  if it's not uh of course controlled by them in some way
[02:38:31.320 --> 02:38:35.560]  if it's not part of their world so just a thousand different babbling groups of
[02:38:35.560 --> 02:38:39.560]  morons fighting with each other with central government central religion
[02:38:39.560 --> 02:38:46.280]  playing referee absolutely and i mean now that we saw the pope being
[02:38:46.280 --> 02:38:50.440]  the spiritual leader of this new world order and obama being
[02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:55.160]  you know we have on one side the the false prophet and obama basically being
[02:38:55.160 --> 02:38:58.440]  the antichrist of the situation i'm not saying that he is the antichrist
[02:38:58.440 --> 02:39:01.640]  but it's an antichrist spirit it's a model of the great one to come as the
[02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:06.120]  bible says over and over again there's waves building precursors
[02:39:06.120 --> 02:39:11.080]  test towards the final but the technology that we have
[02:39:11.080 --> 02:39:14.360]  these days is not the one we had a few hundred years ago so what these people
[02:39:14.360 --> 02:39:18.120]  are doing these days it's it's incredible and of course
[02:39:18.120 --> 02:39:23.640]  is of much bigger proportions and reaches every single side of this planet
[02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:27.240]  there is no way of escaping so now we finally have the technology for everyone
[02:39:27.240 --> 02:39:30.520]  worldwide to see the beast in the same hour and to see the talking machine in
[02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:33.880]  jerusalem and to see the miracles and to see
[02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:37.000]  all the things that are described that is pure science fiction then
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:41.720]  now reality yes and and there is also as i mentioned
[02:39:41.720 --> 02:39:47.560]  in that documentary we did in rome the situation of a lady of mejugori that
[02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:52.280]  is creating still a lot of problems within the catholic church and now there
[02:39:52.280 --> 02:39:56.200]  is being the mysterious death of a priest
[02:39:56.200 --> 02:40:01.720]  recently in mejugori and people are starting to wonder if in some
[02:40:01.720 --> 02:40:05.240]  way this death is connected to the fact that the Vatican
[02:40:05.240 --> 02:40:09.960]  wants to cast out the mejugori visions from their belief system
[02:40:09.960 --> 02:40:14.760]  because they are contrary to what the Vatican is doing these days
[02:40:14.760 --> 02:40:18.360]  sherry in texas you're on the air with leo zagami go ahead
[02:40:18.360 --> 02:40:24.200]  yes i'm still here i just think that christ who is divine
[02:40:24.200 --> 02:40:27.800]  became who we were in our humanity as well as
[02:40:27.800 --> 02:40:32.520]  as in his divinus to let us know that we can see and live beyond the worldly
[02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:35.880]  view the world is our way it reflects us
[02:40:35.880 --> 02:40:39.720]  all our lack of brotherhood from sea to shining sea
[02:40:39.720 --> 02:40:44.120]  is all reflected in the world the christ came to show us a new way
[02:40:44.120 --> 02:40:47.560]  and and i think there is something in the pope
[02:40:47.560 --> 02:40:51.240]  that i have to stand up for because he seems to be able
[02:40:51.240 --> 02:40:55.480]  to see beyond the worldly view and that's why a lot of his things
[02:40:55.480 --> 02:41:00.680]  seem contradictory to what the world has always held
[02:41:00.680 --> 02:41:03.800]  from a religious standpoint from a christian standpoint
[02:41:03.800 --> 02:41:08.920]  like homosexuality alex i don't want to get off on other subjects but
[02:41:08.920 --> 02:41:14.920]  was it not perhaps not homosexuality the translation
[02:41:14.920 --> 02:41:19.240]  but shouldn't that have been pedophilia but that word wasn't available
[02:41:19.240 --> 02:41:23.000]  i think christ you know was not there judging people and folks could always
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:27.480]  repent and as i heard what you're saying i appreciate your call but ma'am
[02:41:27.480 --> 02:41:31.880]  what the jesuit's put out is pure ford foundation globalism liberation theology
[02:41:31.880 --> 02:41:34.440]  they fill the emirates full of hatred many of them
[02:41:34.440 --> 02:41:37.480]  still have a lot of beautiful wonderful people but they fill them full of all
[02:41:37.480 --> 02:41:41.720]  this class envy all this garbage and so he's spewing the
[02:41:41.720 --> 02:41:46.600]  the the new world order project of deindustrialization and
[02:41:46.600 --> 02:41:50.280]  balkanization and the end of national sovereignty
[02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:54.760]  and so he sounds all nice up at the top but when you know the larger agenda
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:41:59.640]  he's pushing what the most vicious evil globalist want
[02:41:59.640 --> 02:42:03.880]  and you see them giving power to him and all the world leaders
[02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:08.280]  lining up fawning after him except for putin
[02:42:08.280 --> 02:42:13.720]  and it's just it's wild to watch leo quick comment on that thank you ma'am
[02:42:13.720 --> 02:42:18.040]  well it's uh very important to realize that
[02:42:18.040 --> 02:42:22.920]  a few years i mean i think it was around 2009 2010 for example there was a guy
[02:42:22.920 --> 02:42:26.840]  called don verze is very powerful in the vatican setup he just died a couple
[02:42:26.840 --> 02:42:31.320]  years ago he was starting to promote microchipping
[02:42:31.320 --> 02:42:35.720]  just to it was just an example to let you know that i think the values that the
[02:42:35.720 --> 02:42:39.960]  catholic church is promoting are very far from the christian values
[02:42:39.960 --> 02:42:43.880]  of jesus and they are as far as you can get
[02:42:43.880 --> 02:42:47.160]  and have nothing to do with well that's it i mean it's more and more lined up
[02:42:47.160 --> 02:42:50.200]  with world government it's lined up with the technocracy it's lined up
[02:42:50.200 --> 02:42:55.000]  with the mark of the beast technocracy technocracy that was something
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:59.320]  that was invented by count to the simon who lived
[02:42:59.320 --> 02:43:04.680]  in the period i think it was between 70 74 and 1825
[02:43:04.680 --> 02:43:09.000]  count to the simon was the guy who actually created the the basic idea of
[02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:13.720]  technocracy that will later be developed by various people
[02:43:13.720 --> 02:43:17.880]  in this in this setup that now became the new world order
[02:43:17.880 --> 02:43:21.800]  which of course took over also the concept of synergy
[02:43:21.800 --> 02:43:27.880]  and what they want to do now is to use all these technocrats to take over all
[02:43:27.880 --> 02:43:31.000]  the various governments these technocrats who don't really have a
[02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:34.280]  soul they don't really represent the people we already have them in place
[02:43:34.280 --> 02:43:37.720]  here in europe you you fortunately still don't have them
[02:43:37.720 --> 02:43:42.440]  in the us as much as you have them here even if obama in some ways is a
[02:43:42.440 --> 02:43:46.200]  technocrat but the ones over here look really the path
[02:43:46.200 --> 02:43:50.280]  they have classes they have their own troic agenda and they're really
[02:43:50.280 --> 02:43:56.200]  a hundred percent so less and they are zombies of the new world order who work
[02:43:56.200 --> 02:44:02.520]  to achieve the power for the families on top that dominate then the high finance
[02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:05.560]  debatica together with them because of course
[02:44:05.560 --> 02:44:09.560]  there's a whole setup together with debatica made of certain families
[02:44:09.560 --> 02:44:14.440]  or certain interests there is also other religious leaders involved
[02:44:14.440 --> 02:44:18.440]  we have seen this i mean it's a melting pot that in the end
[02:44:18.440 --> 02:44:22.840]  wants to install this world government and this is really the kickstaff
[02:44:22.840 --> 02:44:25.480]  authority is in front of the highs of the whole world
[02:44:25.480 --> 02:44:29.640]  i mean the italian prime minister just declared
[02:44:29.640 --> 02:44:35.560]  agenda 2030 to be a great thing and that we should all look into it and it means
[02:44:35.560 --> 02:44:39.240]  the end of the family private property everything i mean they are bringing in
[02:44:39.240 --> 02:44:45.320]  a hellish world saying no vacations no meat no air conditioning no nothing
[02:44:45.320 --> 02:44:50.200]  just smiling at us and then blocking and clean industrialization
[02:44:50.200 --> 02:44:56.280]  i mean this is the end of humanity trillions alex because this agenda 2030
[02:44:56.280 --> 02:44:59.880]  needs trillions who's going to give trillions
[02:44:59.880 --> 02:45:04.520]  i mean they want like five trillions a month out of us i mean they will
[02:45:04.520 --> 02:45:08.520]  simply destroy the economies of all countries by doing this
[02:45:08.520 --> 02:45:11.960]  absolutely it's a total consolidation where we're so poor they can dictate
[02:45:11.960 --> 02:45:16.360]  absolute terms to us it is pure evil robert in
[02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:20.840]  missouri are on the air with leo zigami i'm alex jones go ahead
[02:45:20.840 --> 02:45:25.640]  hey alex and leo check this out when the pope spoke before the united nations
[02:45:25.640 --> 02:45:29.240]  have your boys alex cue this up right at the beginning where he starts his
[02:45:29.240 --> 02:45:32.840]  remarks he says i come in my own name and in the
[02:45:32.840 --> 02:45:36.840]  name of the catholic community will check out john 543 i am coming my
[02:45:36.840 --> 02:45:41.160]  father's name and you receive me not if another shall come in his own name
[02:45:41.160 --> 02:45:46.440]  him you will receive i know exactly he's like following stuff i've read
[02:45:46.440 --> 02:45:50.760]  in like serious you know fbi criminology reports about satanism
[02:45:50.760 --> 02:45:54.840]  what the real satanists do is they they blaspheme and change everything that's
[02:45:54.840 --> 02:45:58.440]  key in the bible so he says christ felled at the cross the cross is a
[02:45:58.440 --> 02:46:02.040]  failure guys cue up uh pope frances you in
[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:06.520]  address i want to see that he said i come in my own name repeat that again
[02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:11.240]  yes the very first remarks out of his his mouth the translator will say it i
[02:46:11.240 --> 02:46:15.640]  flipped out alex all he says i come to you in my own name in the name of the
[02:46:15.640 --> 02:46:18.360]  catholic community did not come in the name of the father
[02:46:18.360 --> 02:46:22.280]  the son in the holy spirit i never saw him do the sign of the cross while he
[02:46:22.280 --> 02:46:25.960]  was here any of that stuff this guy is an imposter
[02:46:25.960 --> 02:46:29.800]  and i tell you what when you cue that up the first remarks out of his mouth when
[02:46:29.800 --> 02:46:33.960]  he says i come in my own name it reminded me of that biblical prophecy
[02:46:33.960 --> 02:46:37.880]  and it really just threw a red flag up in my in my spirit
[02:46:37.880 --> 02:46:42.360]  and uh the one lady that said when jesus was on the cross and he said um
[02:46:42.360 --> 02:46:46.520]  father father why have you forsaken me he was actually fulfilling a bible
[02:46:46.520 --> 02:46:50.120]  prophecy from the psalms when king david was on the run
[02:46:50.120 --> 02:46:54.040]  from king psalm king david said that in the psalms everything
[02:46:54.040 --> 02:46:57.320]  jesus did was fulfilling an old testament prophecy
[02:46:57.320 --> 02:47:01.720]  he was god he didn't lose his faith he was actually re quoting stuff out of the
[02:47:01.720 --> 02:47:04.760]  psalms just like them casting locks for his garments
[02:47:04.760 --> 02:47:08.760]  everything he did was a fulfillment of the old testament prophecies
[02:47:08.760 --> 02:47:12.360]  he fulfilled over 300 of them and that's how you know he's the
[02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:15.560]  he's the real thing and i just wanted to throw that out there but go to that
[02:47:15.560 --> 02:47:19.560]  beginning of the un it'll flip you out because he came in his own name he did
[02:47:19.560 --> 02:47:22.920]  not come in the name of the lord sure we just put up a new york speech he gave
[02:47:22.920 --> 02:47:26.040]  another speech we're finding it right now or i can find it
[02:47:26.040 --> 02:47:29.000]  um thank you so there it is transcript read the
[02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.880]  pope francis speech the united nations here it is
[02:47:31.880 --> 02:47:35.640]  thank you for your kind words once again following a tradition
[02:47:35.640 --> 02:47:38.680]  which i feel honored the secretary of journal united nations the pope to
[02:47:38.680 --> 02:47:42.920]  address the distinguished assembly of nations in my own name
[02:47:42.920 --> 02:47:47.320]  and that of the entire catholic community well as we said in my name not in
[02:47:47.320 --> 02:47:50.840]  christ's name that is unprecedented you're absolutely right
[02:47:50.840 --> 02:47:54.120]  so there you go time magazine with the transcript thank you so much
[02:47:54.120 --> 02:47:58.040]  uh leo zegami i tell you it just gets crazier doesn't it
[02:47:58.040 --> 02:48:01.960]  well i hope it doesn't get to the point of the mark of the beast
[02:48:01.960 --> 02:48:06.440]  being the the the microchip because at that point you know i mean
[02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:10.840]  i will of course say that everything that's been prophesied
[02:48:10.840 --> 02:48:14.680]  is standing out to be true and is dramatically in front of our eyes right
[02:48:14.680 --> 02:48:17.400]  now so we have to pray like you said at the
[02:48:17.400 --> 02:48:21.480]  beginning of the show people need to pray for us i mean when the pope went
[02:48:21.480 --> 02:48:25.560]  out there the first time and he asked people to pay for him that was
[02:48:25.560 --> 02:48:30.120]  completely wrong because the church should have enough power
[02:48:30.120 --> 02:48:34.120]  to actually give his own blessings to the people not want people to pray but
[02:48:34.120 --> 02:48:38.360]  he's continuing to say that he always say pray for me pray for me
[02:48:38.360 --> 02:48:44.360]  he's getting that means pray to him yeah pray to him that's what it's not
[02:48:44.360 --> 02:48:47.960]  at majority day gloria and that's the motto of the jazz rights but it's at
[02:48:47.960 --> 02:48:52.440]  majority day over him basically to the glory of himself that he's
[02:48:52.440 --> 02:48:59.160]  going to the castros in kuba uh coming to the us well he told baner that i mean i
[02:48:59.160 --> 02:49:02.360]  know if you're in trouble ask folks to pray for you i do that too but yeah
[02:49:02.360 --> 02:49:05.640]  he's supposed to be up there as the church leader saying god's blessing you
[02:49:05.640 --> 02:49:10.680]  not i need the blessing that he's taking in an energy because he's a vampire
[02:49:10.680 --> 02:49:17.080]  and that's a satanic for you i mean that's satanism to take the energy
[02:49:17.080 --> 02:49:21.080]  and to you see there is a concept which maybe you're not familiar with but i
[02:49:21.080 --> 02:49:25.560]  want to introduce you to is the concept of agregor have you ever heard of it
[02:49:25.560 --> 02:49:29.800]  yes it is the concept the concept of agregor is very important because a
[02:49:29.800 --> 02:49:36.120]  number of people together form a thought and this thought becomes an agregor an
[02:49:36.120 --> 02:49:40.200]  entity now the agregor of the catholic church is one of the most powerful
[02:49:40.200 --> 02:49:42.760]  being a more than a billion people who follow this church
[02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:47.880]  it's a giant mom's psychology and of course if he wants them to pray for him
[02:49:47.880 --> 02:49:51.960]  is just getting this energy for him is not releasing anything to the people
[02:49:51.960 --> 02:49:54.520]  like the the old popes used to bless
[02:49:54.520 --> 02:49:59.960]  people be caring towards the others and now he said he wants to take
[02:49:59.960 --> 02:50:03.560]  take pray for me pray because i'm doing this i have to do it
[02:50:03.560 --> 02:50:08.840]  it's necessary he's like he's really trapped by his own uh you know his own
[02:50:08.840 --> 02:50:13.000]  role in the new world though well he tries to act humble but you look at him
[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:19.080]  he is seething with power well if sometimes you spot him out of camera
[02:50:19.080 --> 02:50:23.640]  you can really see his real face and his real look is completely different from
[02:50:23.640 --> 02:50:27.400]  what then you know he shows on camera he's a great actor
[02:50:27.400 --> 02:50:31.240]  well i don't mean this is a cheap shot i saw him on skype during the breaks and
[02:50:31.240 --> 02:50:34.440]  i mean david duke looked like a different person
[02:50:34.440 --> 02:50:40.360]  when he was not on camera and i want to say powerful scary i mean i was going
[02:50:40.360 --> 02:50:44.440]  man that guy looks whoa that doesn't even look oh very wolf-like
[02:50:44.440 --> 02:50:48.040]  uh and i don't mean that's a cheap shot i mean maybe i'll get him back on sometime
[02:50:48.040 --> 02:50:50.440]  and just like catch him nearing and tell him i'll be taping you during the
[02:50:50.440 --> 02:50:53.400]  breaks buddy we're gonna catch this on tape but i mean yeah you see these people

[02:56:30.840 --> 02:56:33.480]  absolutely i mean i go to the doctor sometimes on each stuff
[02:56:33.480 --> 02:56:36.760]  it's just that the system doesn't want competition with mother nature

[02:56:49.160 --> 02:56:51.960]  here but we'll take a few in the final next segment and i'll let you get to
[02:56:51.960 --> 02:56:56.360]  bed i know it's late over there uh in idly and rome but leo's
[02:56:56.360 --> 02:57:00.760]  weapons let's talk about this pope going against weapon dealers when he
[02:57:00.760 --> 02:57:04.600]  placed a weapon dealer as the head of his vatican bank
[02:57:04.600 --> 02:57:08.280]  ernes von freeberg with the biggest weapon dealer in germany
[02:57:08.280 --> 02:57:12.680]  a knight of malta he placed him after oh yeah he wants our guns
[02:57:12.680 --> 02:57:17.000]  he claims he's against weapons but then he's heavily involved in
[02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:20.120]  he's heavily involved i mean he's involved up to his neck he gets all the
[02:57:20.120 --> 02:57:24.520]  money from the weapon dealers to his bank the yord the yord i mean it's
[02:57:24.520 --> 02:57:28.200]  it's incredible the level of hypocrisy of this pope i mean
[02:57:28.200 --> 02:57:31.080]  i'm i'm really shocked now i know he came and spoke against the second
[02:57:31.080 --> 02:57:33.720]  amendment we're supposed to just bow down to him
[02:57:33.720 --> 02:57:37.320]  because he wants to promote all these immigrants to arrive
[02:57:37.320 --> 02:57:41.640]  you know here in europe in the u.s basically arriving with all the crime
[02:57:41.640 --> 02:57:45.720]  that of course and he wants them to be able to have their way and and and not
[02:57:45.720 --> 02:57:48.760]  be you know molested for people defending themselves
[02:57:48.760 --> 02:57:53.800]  because in italy you know it happened that some a couple of 70 year old
[02:57:53.800 --> 02:57:58.600]  the the woman was uh was basically raped and thrown out of the window and the
[02:57:58.600 --> 02:58:02.520]  guy was his plot was slashed by a guy who was in a refugee
[02:58:02.520 --> 02:58:07.480]  center a hundred meters away i mean and this is what's happening in italy
[02:58:07.480 --> 02:58:11.080]  so i'm sure that also in the u.s you have a lot of crime by immigrants well you're
[02:58:11.080 --> 02:58:14.040]  not allowed to say that they're god they're allowed to do what they want
[02:58:14.040 --> 02:58:18.680]  because again the globalists want cheap labor i mean i certainly know that
[02:58:18.680 --> 02:58:22.040]  i want to talk about the astrology because i cut you off earlier because of a
[02:58:22.040 --> 02:58:25.320]  break and never got back into the astrology a lot of stations are starting

[03:00:24.520 --> 03:00:28.520]  plan kurt nemo breaks it down it does cut taxes some so i i said i thought it
[03:00:28.520 --> 03:00:31.960]  was good nemo hates it he just wants the whole thing gone and i get it
[03:00:31.960 --> 03:00:34.920]  uh i don't can totally control my riders and they have their own brains so i
[03:00:34.920 --> 03:00:37.640]  can disagree with them sometimes but i don't think i disagree with kurt i mean
[03:00:37.640 --> 03:00:39.560]  i get where he's coming from but i'll take anything

[03:01:05.960 --> 03:01:10.840]  leo zigami i i want to finish up with you on
[03:01:10.840 --> 03:01:14.040]  uh astrology they had been a lot of pubs are obsessed with a lot of presidents
[03:01:14.040 --> 03:01:17.240]  are obsessed with it uh i mean the elites make a lot of
[03:01:17.240 --> 03:01:22.280]  decisions on this ancient pseudoscience i know astronomy came out of it i know
[03:01:22.280 --> 03:01:24.920]  a lot of mathematics came out of it so i i mean i
[03:01:24.920 --> 03:01:27.960]  i kind of respect people at least that are at least in the mumbo jumbo because
[03:01:27.960 --> 03:01:30.840]  at least they think something else is going on at least they're looking for
[03:01:30.840 --> 03:01:34.520]  things maybe in the real world they look for things as well so i'm not you know
[03:01:34.520 --> 03:01:37.480]  calling everybody superstitious i don't really buy into it but
[03:01:37.480 --> 03:01:41.880]  the vatican really does don't they well it all comes from
[03:01:41.880 --> 03:01:46.520]  what has been defined in more recent times in the 18th and 19th century as
[03:01:46.520 --> 03:01:52.280]  astroteology so basically the date is and of course
[03:01:52.280 --> 03:01:55.960]  related with the stars also in ancient Babylonian cults so basically they are
[03:01:55.960 --> 03:02:00.840]  going back to those primitive cults we were talking about earlier they
[03:02:00.840 --> 03:02:07.240]  respect these cults and they respect these stars as they are gods so they
[03:02:07.240 --> 03:02:11.320]  calculate their position in relation to the earth
[03:02:11.320 --> 03:02:14.520]  because they think that they actually influences them
[03:02:14.520 --> 03:02:19.640]  and it also amplifies the ritual that they actually do on that specific day in
[03:02:19.640 --> 03:02:23.960]  that specific hour which every single hour of the day
[03:02:23.960 --> 03:02:28.200]  alex every single minute of the day has a different spirit
[03:02:28.200 --> 03:02:31.960]  and every culture on earth worshiped according to the stars based
[03:02:31.960 --> 03:02:37.000]  the same way and gave human sacrifices so now we launch wars on these dates
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:42.280]  the elite really do believe in it every billionaire i've known has secretly
[03:02:42.280 --> 03:02:45.880]  been obsessed off record with the occult with astrology
[03:02:45.880 --> 03:02:51.320]  i mean this is what the elite are into well it seems to work you see because
[03:02:51.320 --> 03:02:56.600]  at least on the dark side when they for example sacrifice something can be an
[03:02:56.600 --> 03:03:01.320]  animal like a babalao in in kuba in the santeria
[03:03:01.320 --> 03:03:05.800]  or it could be actually a human being like certain satanic cults do
[03:03:05.800 --> 03:03:11.080]  it actually seems to bring empower the aggregate of this group so the
[03:03:11.080 --> 03:03:15.640]  thought that this group has together empower them with some
[03:03:15.640 --> 03:03:19.560]  specific power that they might have you know especially
[03:03:19.560 --> 03:03:23.240]  at the materialistic level not at the spiritual level of course because at the
[03:03:23.240 --> 03:03:28.040]  spiritual level this is all garbage
[03:03:28.040 --> 03:03:31.720]  they certainly are into it so is it basically like a weegee board if you
[03:03:31.720 --> 03:03:34.840]  believed in that is just something the spirits uses the interface and so the
[03:03:34.840 --> 03:03:38.040]  belief in the movement of the planets becomes something through which demonic
[03:03:38.040 --> 03:03:42.520]  spirits manipulate the elite well even the lodges of
[03:03:42.520 --> 03:03:45.880]  remission even the good lodges even the lodge where judge washington was
[03:03:45.880 --> 03:03:50.600]  initiated had to follow this course it meets at a certain hour in a
[03:03:50.600 --> 03:03:54.360]  certain day of the week and and the ritual is
[03:03:54.360 --> 03:03:59.400]  conducted following basically you are reflecting below what is above
[03:03:59.400 --> 03:04:04.520]  this is a rule of the emerald tablets that is followed by the operatives
[03:04:04.520 --> 03:04:07.720]  45 seconds what's your view of George Washington
[03:04:07.720 --> 03:04:11.880]  he was a great i mean he was not only a freemason i i'm also
[03:04:11.880 --> 03:04:15.560]  a freemason so not all all freemasons are bad there is also a good side to
[03:04:15.560 --> 03:04:18.440]  freemason i i hope one day we can talk about that
[03:04:18.440 --> 03:04:22.200]  but in any case George Washington was a great guy like you said
[03:04:22.200 --> 03:04:26.040]  he was trying to get that independence from
[03:04:26.040 --> 03:04:30.440]  that aristocrats that royalties in Europe from the church in Europe he was
[03:04:30.440 --> 03:04:34.200]  really somebody who was laying the foundation for a great nation which is
[03:04:34.200 --> 03:04:37.400]  the us which should really reflect this liberty and
[03:04:37.400 --> 03:04:41.320]  still does but for how long before the mondial is to shut down everything
[03:04:41.320 --> 03:04:45.480]  because like you see what you said the other day about the
[03:04:45.480 --> 03:04:49.560]  fb i'm starting to investigate you well of course
[03:04:49.560 --> 03:04:53.080]  when you start to discuss things like the Vatican you become
[03:04:53.080 --> 03:04:56.680]  even more of a target absolutely i know that god bless you

[03:05:08.440 --> 03:05:12.040]  violates international law he told cbs that in his opinion
[03:05:12.040 --> 03:05:15.640]  provision of military support to illegal structures runs counter to the
[03:05:15.640 --> 03:05:18.120]  principles of modern international law in the united
[03:05:18.120 --> 03:05:21.640]  nations charter he also pointed out that Assad's army is fighting against

[03:05:24.200 --> 03:05:28.120]  even the new york times agrees with them back in 2013 the newspaper reported
[03:05:28.120 --> 03:05:31.400]  that the majority of the rebels in syria have sworn allegiance to isis
[03:05:31.400 --> 03:05:34.280]  there's not a secular fighting force against Assad to speak of
[03:05:34.280 --> 03:05:38.520]  basel address a commander of a rebel brigade in syria said that his brigade
[03:05:38.520 --> 03:05:41.160]  was collaborating with the islamic state and the news

[03:08:09.080 --> 03:08:13.480]  welcome back to the alex jones show you are now listening to the fourth hour
[03:08:13.480 --> 03:08:17.880]  overdrive i am leon macadoo sitting in and kit daniels are one of our lead
[03:08:17.880 --> 03:08:21.080]  writers here at info wars is joining me as well
[03:08:21.080 --> 03:08:24.600]  we're going to be kind of wrapping up some of the key intel that we just got
[03:08:24.600 --> 03:08:29.640]  listening to leo zegami talking about the pope invoking globalization
[03:08:29.640 --> 03:08:32.280]  kit daniels i wanted to get you in here because you've done
[03:08:32.280 --> 03:08:35.480]  quite a few reports pretty stellar reporting there
[03:08:35.480 --> 03:08:39.640]  giving a little bit of history on on the Jesuits and and sort of what this
[03:08:39.640 --> 03:08:43.400]  means you know i i never really understood it or
[03:08:43.400 --> 03:08:46.680]  why so many people were so concerned with the fact that the pope
[03:08:46.680 --> 03:08:50.600]  is a Jesuit and you know i was kind of researching sort of the dark corridors of
[03:08:50.600 --> 03:08:54.760]  the internet um so for those of us who just don't understand
[03:08:54.760 --> 03:08:58.440]  educate me a little bit why why should people be concerned about this what's
[03:08:58.440 --> 03:09:01.800]  the big deal well uh ever since 1930s the communists
[03:09:01.800 --> 03:09:05.560]  have been slowly uh kind of infiltrating the catholic church
[03:09:05.560 --> 03:09:09.480]  and its power structural excuse me the power structure to kind of uh
[03:09:09.480 --> 03:09:13.880]  hijack it and take it over from within and you know decades later we saw the
[03:09:13.880 --> 03:09:15.960]  Jesuit movement movement come out of latin america
[03:09:15.960 --> 03:09:20.840]  predominantly i think in the 1970s and it was i found this really interesting i
[03:09:20.840 --> 03:09:24.840]  found this on the internet and this lady by the name of bella dodd
[03:09:24.840 --> 03:09:28.520]  who was a she used to be an ex-communist party of america
[03:09:28.520 --> 03:09:34.440]  back in his heyday in 40s and 50s and uh she later turned catholic in her
[03:09:34.440 --> 03:09:41.960]  last stages of her life but she admitted that as a communist agent she uh
[03:09:41.960 --> 03:09:46.840]  she encouraged over 1000 uh leftist radicals to
[03:09:46.840 --> 03:09:50.760]  to start joining catholic seminaries and to slowly take over the catholic
[03:09:50.760 --> 03:09:54.520]  church from within and she explained that of all the
[03:09:54.520 --> 03:09:57.080]  world religions the catholic church was the only one feared by
[03:09:57.080 --> 03:09:59.800]  communists because it was its only effective opponent
[03:09:59.800 --> 03:10:04.200]  opponent especially since the catholic church had very strong ties to
[03:10:04.200 --> 03:10:07.480]  latin america and south america where you saw these communist regimes
[03:10:07.480 --> 03:10:10.760]  uprising so you have like in a lot of these
[03:10:10.760 --> 03:10:13.720]  countries back in the day were kind of more or less failed states so the only
[03:10:13.720 --> 03:10:17.560]  thing that was very stable and had been there for centuries was the catholic
[03:10:17.560 --> 03:10:21.400]  church they were the only ones that were you know could stand
[03:10:21.400 --> 03:10:23.640]  effectively against the communists that are trying to take over those
[03:10:23.640 --> 03:10:28.040]  countries at that time right i was looking something where
[03:10:28.040 --> 03:10:31.240]  hitler actually said i learned a lot from the jesuit
[03:10:31.240 --> 03:10:34.600]  some you know or stalin or who else do we have
[03:10:34.600 --> 03:10:39.000]  uh that um was also like jesuit educated
[03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:42.200]  i you see it a lot with this communist leadership yeah
[03:10:42.200 --> 03:10:47.080]  which is pretty interesting i guess um so now obviously with the jesuits they
[03:10:47.080 --> 03:10:50.680]  have the vow of poverty and so a lot of people say well that's
[03:10:50.680 --> 03:10:53.720]  socialism and they're not they also take this vow that they're not going to
[03:10:53.720 --> 03:10:58.280]  take higher office well now we have the pope i mean the highest
[03:10:58.280 --> 03:11:03.240]  office in the land so to speak well my whole problem with liberation theology
[03:11:03.240 --> 03:11:06.200]  which i think came out kind of emerged out of the 70s i believe there's like a
[03:11:06.200 --> 03:11:09.880]  resilient theologist that really developed the concept and the
[03:11:09.880 --> 03:11:15.800]  jesuits took it over made it one of her own was when i was in college i took a
[03:11:15.800 --> 03:11:20.280]  philosophy class and one of the uh the i had one of those essay
[03:11:20.280 --> 03:11:24.680]  question tests and one of the uh questions i had was
[03:11:24.680 --> 03:11:28.040]  you know jesus sounded a lot like a socialist but was he a socialist you
[03:11:28.040 --> 03:11:31.560]  know yes or no what do you think and i wrote on the answer i was like he
[03:11:31.560 --> 03:11:34.520]  wasn't a socialist because yeah he pushed he said some of the same thing
[03:11:34.520 --> 03:11:38.280]  socialists say about oh we got to fight for against poverty and this and that
[03:11:38.280 --> 03:11:41.400]  but here's the clear difference between jesus and socialists in the
[03:11:41.400 --> 03:11:46.440]  return uh liberation theology jesus never as far as i know
[03:11:46.440 --> 03:11:51.320]  advocated the violent use of force to in order to achieve those ends
[03:11:51.320 --> 03:11:56.360]  and that not only is that the very definition of socialism that's also
[03:11:56.360 --> 03:11:59.800]  the very definition of government itself i mean government simply is a monopoly
[03:11:59.800 --> 03:12:03.000]  on the use of force in a given territory right well yeah look at this
[03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:06.440]  headline i believe this was the financial times
[03:12:06.440 --> 03:12:10.360]  can attack helicopters save un peacekeeping
[03:12:10.360 --> 03:12:15.240]  so we got the un peacekeepers who are really just like the un's military
[03:12:15.240 --> 03:12:18.760]  and i mean just the irony of calling them peacekeepers
[03:12:18.760 --> 03:12:22.680]  when basically they're sent in there with weapons and tens of thousands of
[03:12:22.680 --> 03:12:27.960]  troops um you know keeping the peace and say trust you say this because it's
[03:12:27.960 --> 03:12:32.040]  just like this whole inverted reality you have them calling peacekeepers people
[03:12:32.040 --> 03:12:36.040]  who were soldiers in a war right same time we have the catholic
[03:12:36.040 --> 03:12:39.800]  church and the pope calling themselves well not so much the catholic church but
[03:12:39.800 --> 03:12:43.320]  the kind of power structure in the pope claiming to be this spokesperson for
[03:12:43.320 --> 03:12:46.040]  christianity but the same time he's almost doing the
[03:12:46.040 --> 03:12:48.920]  complete opposite of that he's pushing for socialism or government
[03:12:48.920 --> 03:12:52.600]  regulation there just about anything that goes against the teachings of christ
[03:12:52.600 --> 03:12:55.640]  right now coming up in the next segment we're going to be getting jacari jackson
[03:12:55.640 --> 03:12:59.480]  in here he uh he has just returned from this
[03:12:59.480 --> 03:13:03.000]  papal coverage and of course one of the big things that
[03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:06.520]  one of the big stories coming out of it was this uh that the pope
[03:13:06.520 --> 03:13:10.040]  uh basically talked about the failure of the cross
[03:13:10.040 --> 03:13:13.640]  so there's a lot of confusion over what did he mean by that some people say
[03:13:13.640 --> 03:13:17.000]  you know well christ was on the cross saying why did you
[03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:19.800]  forsake me but really he was prepared for that the
[03:13:19.800 --> 03:13:23.080]  entire time he said i'm gonna you know do this
[03:13:23.080 --> 03:13:27.400]  to he predicted his own death right exactly so for him that was his ultimate
[03:13:27.400 --> 03:13:31.080]  sacrifice it wasn't a failure on his part and so
[03:13:31.080 --> 03:13:35.480]  what do you make of that i mean is the stage being set for one world religion
[03:13:35.480 --> 03:13:38.840]  um there a lot of people are talking using this term
[03:13:38.840 --> 03:13:41.640]  chrislam which i have never i might not even be saying that right because i've
[03:13:41.640 --> 03:13:44.360]  never heard of it chrislam where they're basically
[03:13:44.360 --> 03:13:51.480]  trying to merge christianity with islam and so yours i mean just the fact for
[03:13:51.480 --> 03:13:55.240]  instance ben carson was being berated by jake tapper
[03:13:55.240 --> 03:13:59.800]  saying you know you say you don't want a muslim president and he's over and
[03:13:59.800 --> 03:14:04.040]  over again saying no what i said was i don't want a president who is going to
[03:14:04.040 --> 03:14:07.880]  whose religion is not going to uh you know will be higher than the
[03:14:07.880 --> 03:14:11.080]  constitution i don't care if it's a christian anyone
[03:14:11.080 --> 03:14:15.480]  and so you're seeing a lot of people attacking christianity
[03:14:15.480 --> 03:14:21.880]  but then really pumping up islam and i mean it just is kind of interesting to
[03:14:21.880 --> 03:14:25.720]  see that it really is there really is some sort of um
[03:14:25.720 --> 03:14:29.400]  a movement an undercurrent of this movement it's interesting you say that
[03:14:29.400 --> 03:14:32.840]  one world religion ties directly into what bella dodd once said in a when
[03:14:32.840 --> 03:14:36.680]  she's given a speech in the 50s she said quote the whole idea was
[03:14:36.680 --> 03:14:39.720]  destroying not the institution of the church but rather the faith of the
[03:14:39.720 --> 03:14:42.120]  people and even use the institution of the church if
[03:14:42.120 --> 03:14:45.880]  possible to destroy the faith through a promotion of a persuadal religion
[03:14:45.880 --> 03:14:49.480]  something that resembled catholicism but was not the real thing
[03:14:49.480 --> 03:14:52.440]  once the faith was destroyed she explained that there would be a guilt
[03:14:52.440 --> 03:14:55.880]  complex introduced into the church to label the church of the past as being
[03:14:55.880 --> 03:14:59.320]  oppressive authoritarian full of prejudices arrogant
[03:14:59.320 --> 03:15:01.960]  and claiming to be the sole processor of truth
[03:15:01.960 --> 03:15:05.560]  and responsible for the divisions of religious bodies throughout the centuries
[03:15:05.560 --> 03:15:08.920]  this would be necessary in order to shame the church leaders into an openness
[03:15:08.920 --> 03:15:11.880]  to the world into a more flexible attitude towards all religion and
[03:15:11.880 --> 03:15:15.400]  philosophies the communists would then exploit this opennessness
[03:15:15.400 --> 03:15:19.000]  in order to undermine the church and i wanted to bring up this quote because
[03:15:19.000 --> 03:15:22.840]  this really ties into the so-called liberal drift of a lot of
[03:15:22.840 --> 03:15:25.880]  denominations and today not even just the catholic church
[03:15:25.880 --> 03:15:29.720]  like the episcopalians like back in 2003 they had a
[03:15:29.720 --> 03:15:33.080]  i think they elected a bishop that started pushing for gay marriage and
[03:15:33.080 --> 03:15:36.440]  this that kind of alienated more the conservative church goers and that
[03:15:36.440 --> 03:15:40.760]  denomination and so and i kind of said a president
[03:15:40.760 --> 03:15:44.280]  actually before that you had in 1977 like the
[03:15:44.280 --> 03:15:47.880]  episcopalians had a i think it was in st louis that had a convention
[03:15:47.880 --> 03:15:51.000]  and they wanted to uh they changed their book a common prayer
[03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:54.440]  and so you already had some work like the most conservative
[03:15:54.440 --> 03:15:57.240]  churches and that denomination started splitting away and that's what they
[03:15:57.240 --> 03:16:00.600]  called the continuing anglican movement now but now
[03:16:00.600 --> 03:16:05.000]  when you went in 2003 you know that they kind of started pushing for gay
[03:16:05.000 --> 03:16:08.360]  marriage and when women priests and whatnot and
[03:16:08.360 --> 03:16:12.760]  once again alienated a lot has actually been pushing to say that that's the
[03:16:12.760 --> 03:16:15.320]  church of the past we need to be more open to
[03:16:15.320 --> 03:16:18.600]  to bring in new followers and to keep evolving
[03:16:18.600 --> 03:16:21.720]  with the times basically what's interesting about all this
[03:16:21.720 --> 03:16:24.920]  is that like you said they're pushing this opennessness
[03:16:24.920 --> 03:16:28.120]  but all the more conservative churches are breaking away from the denomination
[03:16:28.120 --> 03:16:31.000]  like i think the anglicans the continue uh
[03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:34.360]  anglican church in north america broke away from episcopalians like 2009 i
[03:16:34.360 --> 03:16:38.920]  believe and but so you have kind of the episcopalians which
[03:16:38.920 --> 03:16:41.560]  are now more of a very liberal denomination
[03:16:41.560 --> 03:16:45.560]  Methodists are sort of a lot of Methodists are sort of going the same way
[03:16:45.560 --> 03:16:48.760]  and but these churches are all declining in membership
[03:16:48.760 --> 03:16:52.680]  beginning so open and liberal and whatnot that people stop
[03:16:52.680 --> 03:16:57.800]  going the church all together right and now so i know uh one of the topics of
[03:16:57.800 --> 03:17:02.040]  Leo Zagami's book is this 900 year prophecy that this is
[03:17:02.040 --> 03:17:06.360]  this might be the last pope and so let's talk about
[03:17:06.360 --> 03:17:10.680]  the the black pope that's something that i had you know read some things online
[03:17:10.680 --> 03:17:13.320]  and everything the black pope sounds so nefarious
[03:17:13.320 --> 03:17:18.040]  but the superior general of the Jesuits is informally known as the black pope
[03:17:18.040 --> 03:17:21.320]  because of the power of the position that he
[03:17:21.320 --> 03:17:25.720]  holds there so is that what you're speaking about when you talk about their
[03:17:25.720 --> 03:17:29.240]  influence that they've slowly been sort of infiltrating and and
[03:17:29.240 --> 03:17:33.640]  yeah because the inherent weakness of anything that with the power structure
[03:17:33.640 --> 03:17:37.080]  is the fact that it can be people can take it over from within they can
[03:17:37.080 --> 03:17:40.280]  hijack it they can infiltrate it that's what we're seeing with the Catholic
[03:17:40.280 --> 03:17:44.200]  church because now like i like i told you before the show
[03:17:44.200 --> 03:17:48.600]  you know if the pope is really a double worshiper
[03:17:48.600 --> 03:17:52.760]  or like a better term i mean what would be his highest aspiration it would be to
[03:17:52.760 --> 03:17:55.800]  become the pope so and that just sets an example i'm not
[03:17:55.800 --> 03:17:58.520]  saying that he is or not but it shows you that
[03:17:58.520 --> 03:18:02.760]  people who want power are going to have a bias towards positions of power
[03:18:02.760 --> 03:18:05.800]  and same thing we see in the government you know the worst people that
[03:18:05.800 --> 03:18:08.440]  the worst people in the world end up in government positions because they're
[03:18:08.440 --> 03:18:11.480]  attracted to the power and the power structure in itself
[03:18:11.480 --> 03:18:14.840]  well i mean that's pretty interesting i mean coming up in the next segment i
[03:18:14.840 --> 03:18:17.960]  want to take a couple of more phone calls from people that were just trying
[03:18:17.960 --> 03:18:20.360]  to get in to speak with leo's gami since we're
[03:18:20.360 --> 03:18:24.680]  still sort of talking on on that same subject but
[03:18:24.680 --> 03:18:28.120]  it's kind of interesting that a lot of people think
[03:18:28.120 --> 03:18:31.720]  there's something going on with the pope one of the number one search terms on
[03:18:31.720 --> 03:18:34.680]  google was is the pope the antichrist and all of
[03:18:34.680 --> 03:18:38.120]  this stuff is i mean it's kind of interesting that there is
[03:18:38.120 --> 03:18:42.200]  sort of that idea that there's maybe evil
[03:18:42.200 --> 03:18:46.200]  in our midst well at the very least he's practically
[03:18:46.200 --> 03:18:49.720]  helping to destroy the faith i mean nowadays you see
[03:18:49.720 --> 03:18:52.680]  muslims that are coming in the country they're buying up all the churches you
[03:18:52.680 --> 03:18:56.440]  know like in the 60s and 70s we had a heyday of christianity here in america
[03:18:56.440 --> 03:19:00.040]  all these the churches that you see today a lot of them were built at that time
[03:19:00.040 --> 03:19:05.240]  but now the uh congregations are suffering so badly because of lack of
[03:19:05.240 --> 03:19:07.880]  membership they can't pay their bills so they're having to sell the churches
[03:19:07.880 --> 03:19:11.480]  to muslims and now you know american baptist church
[03:19:11.480 --> 03:19:16.760]  down main street usa is now a mosque right yeah and that goes again to with
[03:19:16.760 --> 03:19:19.960]  this whole chryslam thing and and laying a foundation for

[03:24:29.320 --> 03:24:33.400]  wanted to talk about uh a tweet that david night sent out david night
[03:24:33.400 --> 03:24:36.200]  obviously there with chicari jackson has been covering
[03:24:36.200 --> 03:24:40.760]  the pope's visit to the united states and he sent out a tweet
[03:24:40.760 --> 03:24:44.520]  uh there was a big sign there behind the pope and it says
[03:24:44.520 --> 03:24:48.680]  transformational leaders are jesuit educated and it had a big
[03:24:48.680 --> 03:24:52.120]  picture there of the pope and to me that was
[03:24:52.120 --> 03:24:55.800]  and i obviously did david night as well that was pretty um
[03:24:55.800 --> 03:24:59.400]  impressive i guess that they would single out an order like that that they
[03:24:59.400 --> 03:25:03.240]  would single out one group like that yeah and it's basically them immediate
[03:25:03.240 --> 03:25:06.600]  admitting that we're transforming the catholic church you know through jesuism
[03:25:06.600 --> 03:25:09.880]  which is exactly what the pope's doing right now yeah transformational leaders
[03:25:09.880 --> 03:25:13.720]  which obviously this word transformation is going to be one of those
[03:25:13.720 --> 03:25:17.960]  key buzzwords and the whole agenda 21 plan uh because
[03:25:17.960 --> 03:25:21.800]  if you go to the sustainable development program there on the united nations page
[03:25:21.800 --> 03:25:27.160]  it says transforming our world the 2030 agenda for sustainable development so
[03:25:27.160 --> 03:25:28.600]  it is just give it time they're gonna start
[03:25:28.600 --> 03:25:32.600]  all about transformation sustainable christianity maybe yeah and and that this
[03:25:32.600 --> 03:25:35.800]  is that this is the big push for the one world religion one world
[03:25:35.800 --> 03:25:39.240]  government um we're starting to see that here
[03:25:39.240 --> 03:25:42.680]  now i want to go to one of our callers i'm going to go to craig in
[03:25:42.680 --> 03:25:47.080]  michigan and uh go ahead craig
[03:25:47.080 --> 03:25:52.920]  hi uh yes i was watching the uh philly pope show on saturday night on cnn
[03:25:52.920 --> 03:25:58.440]  and during the fray concert the jumbotron behind behind the band
[03:25:58.440 --> 03:26:02.680]  band started showing what appeared to be an image of baphomet
[03:26:02.680 --> 03:26:08.760]  really yes and i just emailed that to um kit daniels the picture that came off
[03:26:08.760 --> 03:26:13.720]  of the world meeting of families 2015 website
[03:26:13.720 --> 03:26:19.160]  okay and it shows up there as well wow yeah i didn't i didn't see that myself
[03:26:19.160 --> 03:26:22.440]  but uh kit kit said he's definitely gonna check that out but i mean that just
[03:26:22.440 --> 03:26:26.680]  ties into what you were saying yeah i mean it's like what we see now
[03:26:26.680 --> 03:26:30.440]  is the fact that they're pushing through the pope
[03:26:30.440 --> 03:26:34.280]  they're pushing all this government initiatives more regulations bigger
[03:26:34.280 --> 03:26:37.720]  government you know the climate change myth so on so forth
[03:26:37.720 --> 03:26:41.560]  because they want to replace christianity with worship the state
[03:26:41.560 --> 03:26:45.160]  where god is the state and you know the
[03:26:45.160 --> 03:26:49.320]  the elites that want to look that want the uh population to see themselves at
[03:26:49.320 --> 03:26:51.800]  god you know of course most of them mass
[03:26:51.800 --> 03:26:56.280]  vast majority of them if not all of them kind of worship lucifer
[03:26:56.280 --> 03:26:59.480]  so they feel like they're empowered by lucifer to uh take over the catholic
[03:26:59.480 --> 03:27:01.720]  church and then kind of replace the christian
[03:27:01.720 --> 03:27:05.640]  teachings with those of the state well and that's why
[03:27:05.640 --> 03:27:10.120]  for me it it is just so sort of shocking here being working at info wars so i
[03:27:10.120 --> 03:27:12.680]  can kind of see behind the curtain a little bit
[03:27:12.680 --> 03:27:15.400]  but that's that's what they don't want you to
[03:27:15.400 --> 03:27:19.720]  to really recognize is that there is this huge push why would you be so
[03:27:19.720 --> 03:27:24.360]  anti christianity attacking christianity and then at the same time really
[03:27:24.360 --> 03:27:28.680]  promoting another religion that in some cases is
[03:27:28.680 --> 03:27:33.080]  much more extreme depending on you know how
[03:27:33.080 --> 03:27:36.840]  how far you want to take it some some muslim people say that they don't agree
[03:27:36.840 --> 03:27:40.520]  with all the tenets of islam and sharia law but
[03:27:40.520 --> 03:27:44.120]  a lot do stretch i haven't looked at it
[03:27:44.120 --> 03:27:47.560]  completely so i'm kind of speculating here but i do have a feeling that
[03:27:47.560 --> 03:27:52.120]  islam fits a lot better into uh government power structure
[03:27:52.120 --> 03:27:59.160]  as far as kind of uh you know you see kind of the most uh
[03:27:59.160 --> 03:28:02.440]  you know the most about islamic countries in the middle east or also have
[03:28:02.440 --> 03:28:06.280]  probably the largest governments or the most powerful governments
[03:28:06.280 --> 03:28:10.840]  but on the other hand you see christianity is more
[03:28:10.840 --> 03:28:14.520]  for the most part through the history especially in the united states
[03:28:14.520 --> 03:28:18.920]  it's been this more rebellious you know we're not going to follow
[03:28:18.920 --> 03:28:21.800]  the government you know without questioning it we're going to follow
[03:28:21.800 --> 03:28:25.640]  our beliefs first right so there's more of a
[03:28:25.640 --> 03:28:29.320]  so i think that's one of the reasons why they're pushing islam over christianity
[03:28:29.320 --> 03:28:33.000]  and i and i kind of agree with that as well also you know you
[03:28:33.000 --> 03:28:37.480]  hear globally that islam is one of the fastest growing religions
[03:28:37.480 --> 03:28:41.400]  so you know you see they always say that empires always fall
[03:28:41.400 --> 03:28:44.920]  and so the people who are sort of controlling this empire they know this
[03:28:44.920 --> 03:28:48.200]  this has happened throughout history so what are you going to do
[03:28:48.200 --> 03:28:51.880]  latch on to the next largest growing religion so you can continue to control
[03:28:51.880 --> 03:28:55.560]  the population merge the two large religions we've seen that
[03:28:55.560 --> 03:28:59.640]  happen so many times throughout history well they well they'll go in and take
[03:28:59.640 --> 03:29:03.000]  over a group and then assimilate some of their beliefs and
[03:29:03.000 --> 03:29:06.200]  and some of the things that they're which is why people can say that there's
[03:29:06.200 --> 03:29:10.120]  some sort of pagan rituals and things like that that fall
[03:29:10.120 --> 03:29:13.240]  in with christianity and things because that's how they're able to assimilate
[03:29:13.240 --> 03:29:17.640]  the group that they conquer is by allowing them to sort of have their
[03:29:17.640 --> 03:29:21.160]  little religious things here and there but you know while
[03:29:21.160 --> 03:29:26.120]  while transforming them entirely and you know but slowly not letting them know
[03:29:26.120 --> 03:29:29.400]  it and that's exactly what we're seeing here it's kind of
[03:29:29.400 --> 03:29:33.240]  it's frightening but it's also a very exciting time to be alive
[03:29:33.240 --> 03:29:36.920]  you know but islam they they struggle with it's
[03:29:36.920 --> 03:29:40.760]  if it's really compatible with democracy and secularism
[03:29:40.760 --> 03:29:44.600]  so you know that's why we don't want a president there that's gonna
[03:29:44.600 --> 03:29:47.960]  uphold sharia law
[03:29:47.960 --> 03:29:51.880]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[03:29:51.880 --> 03:29:56.680]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:29:58.680 --> 03:30:02.840]  kit daniels info wars dot com when it comes to free speech
[03:30:02.840 --> 03:30:06.280]  the entire world is reverting back to the middle ages where you had to watch
[03:30:06.280 --> 03:30:10.200]  what you said in fear of fines or even violent punishment for example at a
[03:30:10.200 --> 03:30:14.280]  so-called free speech event in london an anti-isis piece of art was banned
[03:30:14.280 --> 03:30:18.440]  after police demanded the artist pay 36 000 pounds for its potentially
[03:30:18.440 --> 03:30:22.600]  inflammatory content according to event organizers so police made it clear
[03:30:22.600 --> 03:30:26.360]  they would pass the cost of extra police protection on the artists and the
[03:30:26.360 --> 03:30:29.960]  organizers so in other words if you want to exercise your free speech in the
[03:30:29.960 --> 03:30:32.440]  uk you got to cough up a lot of money first
[03:30:32.440 --> 03:30:36.280]  similarly colleges across the united states are forcing students to apply for
[03:30:36.280 --> 03:30:39.720]  so-called free speech permits before they can exercise their first amendment
[03:30:39.720 --> 03:30:42.280]  rights on campus that's right the colleges that were
[03:30:42.280 --> 03:30:46.360]  home to anti-vietnam war protests are now demanding that you ask campus
[03:30:46.360 --> 03:30:49.000]  officials for permission to protest to sum it up

[03:33:26.680 --> 03:33:31.080]  this is from cnbc angela merkel caught on hot mic
[03:33:31.080 --> 03:33:35.400]  griping to facebook ceo over anti-immigrant posts
[03:33:35.400 --> 03:33:39.400]  wow now what they caught on this hot mic was the facebook ceo
[03:33:39.400 --> 03:33:43.720]  overheard responding that yeah we do need to do some work on that
[03:33:43.720 --> 03:33:48.040]  so basically angela merkel asks him in english are you working on this
[03:33:48.040 --> 03:33:51.800]  and he says affirmative that he is trying to
[03:33:51.800 --> 03:33:55.320]  curtail anti-immigrant posts about the refugee crisis and
[03:33:55.320 --> 03:34:00.360]  and that's exactly what we told you last week when kit daniels article
[03:34:00.360 --> 03:34:04.280]  was on was not we weren't able to post it on
[03:34:04.280 --> 03:34:07.880]  facebook it was being censored and of course that was pope kidd
[03:34:07.880 --> 03:34:13.000]  amnesty activists stage pr stunt to promote illegal immigration so there you
[03:34:13.000 --> 03:34:16.440]  have it facebook actively working to censor
[03:34:16.440 --> 03:34:20.440]  your news and don't you feel comfortable knowing that they are going to be now the
[03:34:20.440 --> 03:34:24.360]  largest news aggregator in the world so i'm sure they've been doing this before you
[03:34:24.360 --> 03:34:28.120]  know it's not all jackson joining me in studio it's not always the
[03:34:28.120 --> 03:34:31.720]  the immigrants you know we've heard reports of gun stuff to try to put
[03:34:31.720 --> 03:34:34.840]  guns the same category is porn and many other things as well
[03:34:34.840 --> 03:34:37.960]  and we're no stranger to censorship whether it's on facebook or
[03:34:37.960 --> 03:34:42.040]  other platforms yeah and it's just it's all part of this whole
[03:34:42.040 --> 03:34:45.640]  you know the new agenda the new takeover facebook is trying to get all
[03:34:45.640 --> 03:34:50.280]  media outlets out there to have to filter their news through facebook so
[03:34:50.280 --> 03:34:53.080]  they're going to be controlling all of the information
[03:34:53.080 --> 03:34:56.440]  that you are receiving now it'll be very interesting to see how
[03:34:56.440 --> 03:35:00.520]  they're going to spin this story a lot of people are kind of confused about this
[03:35:00.520 --> 03:35:03.960]  i want to play this report that you did while you were there in philly
[03:35:03.960 --> 03:35:07.800]  the pope claims jesus failed on the cross so let's go ahead and play that
[03:35:07.800 --> 03:35:12.280]  report jakara jackson for info wars dot com
[03:35:12.280 --> 03:35:16.280]  reporting in philadelphia this is the last day of the pope's visit
[03:35:16.280 --> 03:35:19.640]  now since he's been here he's said and done a lot of things
[03:35:19.640 --> 03:35:23.240]  but the thing that stuck out to me the most is something he said during i
[03:35:23.240 --> 03:35:26.440]  guess it was a mass where he came out and said that
[03:35:26.440 --> 03:35:31.640]  the life of jesus ultimately ended in failure in the failure on the cross
[03:35:31.640 --> 03:35:35.800]  i have the transcript here this is reported by abc news
[03:35:35.800 --> 03:35:41.000]  and it says in part the cross shows us a different way of measuring success
[03:35:41.000 --> 03:35:45.000]  ours is to plant the seed god sees the fruit of our labors
[03:35:45.000 --> 03:35:48.040]  and if at times our efforts and work seem to fail
[03:35:48.040 --> 03:35:52.520]  and not produce fruit we need to remember that we are followers of jesus christ
[03:35:52.520 --> 03:35:57.080]  and his life humanly speaking ended in failure the failure of the cross
[03:35:57.080 --> 03:36:01.240]  that he went on to talk about the dangers of being comfortable
[03:36:01.240 --> 03:36:04.440]  with uh surroundings and things such as that which is a whole another
[03:36:04.440 --> 03:36:08.920]  topic in and of itself but he says the failure of jesus the failure
[03:36:08.920 --> 03:36:11.960]  of the cross even though the bible clearly states
[03:36:11.960 --> 03:36:14.920]  that jesus knew what was going to happen to him
[03:36:14.920 --> 03:36:18.520]  far as the cross were concerned how he is going to lay his life down
[03:36:18.520 --> 03:36:22.120]  he even said lord if it is your will take this bitter cup from me
[03:36:22.120 --> 03:36:25.720]  but not your will but not my will your will be done
[03:36:25.720 --> 03:36:30.040]  and particularly we know this when we look at john 17 and 18
[03:36:30.040 --> 03:36:34.040]  therefore doth my father love me because i laid my life down
[03:36:34.040 --> 03:36:37.560]  that i might take it again no man take it that from me
[03:36:37.560 --> 03:36:42.200]  but i lay it down myself which is to say nobody took his life from him on the
[03:36:42.200 --> 03:36:45.320]  cross he laid it down willingly he knew what was
[03:36:45.320 --> 03:36:49.800]  going to happen to him so to say that his life in general the cross in
[03:36:49.800 --> 03:36:52.440]  particular was a failure is something i'm very
[03:36:52.440 --> 03:36:55.960]  disappointed to see from a supposed spiritual leader
[03:36:55.960 --> 03:36:59.400]  and there are many other things i get to talk about as far as support but this
[03:36:59.400 --> 03:37:02.600]  is something a glaring thing that stuck out to me
[03:37:02.600 --> 03:37:07.000]  so anybody who claims to be a follower of price i'm surprised if they're not as
[03:37:07.000 --> 03:37:11.720]  shocked and appalled by this as i am i found it to be very disturbing
[03:37:11.720 --> 03:37:16.680]  and a very sour note to have while he was here in the united states of america
[03:37:16.680 --> 03:37:20.360]  you can find more reports on info wars dot com
[03:37:20.360 --> 03:37:24.040]  well jacari very nice reporting there so this kind of ties back to
[03:37:24.040 --> 03:37:27.960]  an earlier caller who said she thought people were interpreting this
[03:37:27.960 --> 03:37:32.600]  misinterpreting what the pope had to say she said even jesus said why has thou
[03:37:32.600 --> 03:37:36.600]  forsaken me it's talking about how he did fail or as a
[03:37:36.600 --> 03:37:40.200]  human that was a failure so i disagree with that statement
[03:37:40.200 --> 03:37:44.520]  you're a christian outspoken so i mean what do you think about what the pope
[03:37:44.520 --> 03:37:48.680]  said well just like i said in report i it was very
[03:37:48.680 --> 03:37:54.520]  bizarre and downright uh uh this heartening that here's somebody of that
[03:37:54.520 --> 03:37:59.720]  stature refer to uh jesus's life as a failure in the complete quote which i
[03:37:59.720 --> 03:38:03.640]  read there in the piece he said humanly speaking jesus failed but i don't
[03:38:03.640 --> 03:38:07.640]  consider his life to be a failure at all especially not what he did on the cross
[03:38:07.640 --> 03:38:12.440]  because you know he said not your will i mean not my will but your will be done
[03:38:12.440 --> 03:38:15.800]  lord when he was talking to god before he was to be crucified
[03:38:15.800 --> 03:38:18.920]  you know we uh reference some other scriptures there in the report that we
[03:38:18.920 --> 03:38:23.720]  just played so i don't consider jesus's life to be a uh failure at all
[03:38:23.720 --> 03:38:27.160]  and more on that uh we had a caller who called in earlier and if you guys get
[03:38:27.160 --> 03:38:30.680]  this clip ready referring to some statements that the pope made at the
[03:38:30.680 --> 03:38:33.640]  un i believe it was and uh we'll just play this
[03:38:33.640 --> 03:38:38.760]  clip and then we'll comment after that
[03:39:04.200 --> 03:39:10.440]  to address this distinguished assembly of nation nations
[03:39:10.440 --> 03:39:17.720]  in my own name and that of the entire catholic community
[03:39:17.720 --> 03:39:22.040]  i wish to express to you mr. thank you
[03:39:22.040 --> 03:39:25.320]  so basically what you just heard the pope say there's what the caller was
[03:39:25.320 --> 03:39:29.080]  referring to earlier when he said i come in my own name and you're supposed to
[03:39:29.080 --> 03:39:32.600]  come in the name of god not you know so i can't go and do good
[03:39:32.600 --> 03:39:35.960]  works and so yeah this is you know jacarjax i'm the greatest most awesome
[03:39:35.960 --> 03:39:39.000]  guy on the planet you know you're supposed to come you know when you do
[03:39:39.000 --> 03:39:42.360]  something spiritual you're supposed to give the glory basically to god
[03:39:42.360 --> 03:39:46.680]  so that's what our caller was referring to uh when that earlier segment when he
[03:39:46.680 --> 03:39:49.400]  brought that up and i think that's a very good find many people are you know
[03:39:49.400 --> 03:39:53.080]  they're looking at all these things now because a lot of times people like me
[03:39:53.080 --> 03:39:55.960]  who don't speak multiple languages they have to wait for these transcripts to
[03:39:55.960 --> 03:39:59.160]  come out and just like when i did the report talking about uh
[03:39:59.160 --> 03:40:03.000]  jesus uh failing on the cross in the pope's opinion i waited a couple days
[03:40:03.000 --> 03:40:05.240]  you know trying to see if somebody debunked it if there's another
[03:40:05.240 --> 03:40:08.200]  translation out there but you know everybody was pretty much content with
[03:40:08.200 --> 03:40:11.320]  the translation that was out there so i said well this is what this guy said
[03:40:11.320 --> 03:40:15.720]  i definitely find an issue with the way that he presented christ especially
[03:40:15.720 --> 03:40:21.320]  as uh the supposed figure of the church right that that's the you know
[03:40:21.320 --> 03:40:24.200]  you're supposed to be the head of christianity and now you're trying to
[03:40:24.200 --> 03:40:28.440]  talk about uh take out the value of what happened on the cross i mean that's
[03:40:28.440 --> 03:40:32.600]  like a one of the foundations of christianity the ultimate sacrifice
[03:40:32.600 --> 03:40:35.480]  you understand people wear crosses around their necks they don't wear
[03:40:35.480 --> 03:40:39.080]  popemobiles around their necks they they wear the cross the cross
[03:40:39.080 --> 03:40:42.520]  has a huge significance in christianity right well
[03:40:42.520 --> 03:40:46.040]  that's a very interesting take now switching gears a little bit jacari it
[03:40:46.040 --> 03:40:50.360]  seems like wherever we send you some sort of a lockdown happens like
[03:40:50.360 --> 03:40:53.720]  right here how does that happen i mean you're you're just like that magic
[03:40:53.720 --> 03:40:57.000]  element you know it's like you know if you were to ask me
[03:40:57.000 --> 03:40:59.880]  when i was in high school for every place i went was going to turn to lockdown
[03:40:59.880 --> 03:41:03.480]  i was like you know that's that's ridiculous but yeah whether it's uh
[03:41:03.480 --> 03:41:06.920]  baltimore ferguson uh recently washington
[03:41:06.920 --> 03:41:10.760]  new york city and philadelphia where i just came from this morning
[03:41:10.760 --> 03:41:14.520]  a complete lockdown and the thing interesting about this i was talking to
[03:41:14.520 --> 03:41:18.360]  biggs about this earlier when we went to ferguson they locked down a section of
[03:41:18.360 --> 03:41:20.840]  town when we went to baltimore they had a city
[03:41:20.840 --> 03:41:24.760]  white curfew but they locked down a section of town same thing
[03:41:24.760 --> 03:41:29.000]  in new york and which was relatively small area all things considered
[03:41:29.000 --> 03:41:34.280]  and also in washington dc but we went to philadelphia they pretty much locked down
[03:41:34.280 --> 03:41:38.840]  downtown philadelphia to anybody who hasn't seen our reports over the weekend
[03:41:38.840 --> 03:41:44.120]  david night and myself we arrived on a train uh in the evening of this past
[03:41:44.120 --> 03:41:47.640]  weekend and they had the taxi service suspended they had the
[03:41:47.640 --> 03:41:50.920]  national guard greeted us they said hey there's gonna be no taxi service in this
[03:41:50.920 --> 03:41:53.720]  area so oh crap can we walk at least like yeah so we
[03:41:53.720 --> 03:41:56.920]  can start walking they have bridges shut down they have streets
[03:41:56.920 --> 03:42:01.400]  locked down they have barricades everywhere and what should have been a
[03:42:01.400 --> 03:42:05.800]  45-minute walk turned into over two hours because you know we'd go to a
[03:42:05.800 --> 03:42:08.440]  checkpoint the guys like oh you can't cross here you can cross down there we
[03:42:08.440 --> 03:42:10.920]  get down there until you can't cross here you can't you have to go back over
[03:42:10.920 --> 03:42:13.800]  there it's just i mean in just the way these guys
[03:42:13.800 --> 03:42:16.440]  was just so cavalier about it had been one thing they said hey
[03:42:16.440 --> 03:42:19.240]  they just told me stand here that's all i know is you can't come through here
[03:42:19.240 --> 03:42:22.440]  but they would just like shoo you away hoping that you didn't come back
[03:42:22.440 --> 03:42:24.920]  you know too so they'd have to face you and own up to you know to the
[03:42:24.920 --> 03:42:28.840]  this bunk information that they were telling you but before we go all the
[03:42:28.840 --> 03:42:30.600]  way back and i said we'll go all the way back to
[03:42:30.600 --> 03:42:34.360]  dc where we started our mission i want to tell you guys what happened today
[03:42:34.360 --> 03:42:38.120]  when we got on our plane to come back well i came back here david's uh doing
[03:42:38.120 --> 03:42:41.080]  some family things uh well first of all we had the
[03:42:41.080 --> 03:42:45.000]  world's worst taxi service with i was i honestly want to name these people and
[03:42:45.000 --> 03:42:47.400]  everybody know i shouldn't because they had like just the most
[03:42:47.400 --> 03:42:51.240]  incompetent thing we barely got there by skin of our teeth but luckily
[03:42:51.240 --> 03:42:54.520]  because i guess the pope was in town the tsa thought there were no terrorists
[03:42:54.520 --> 03:42:58.200]  any place anywhere which you know we all know there's not a terrorist under
[03:42:58.200 --> 03:43:01.400]  every rock in the first place but we get there and you know how you have to do
[03:43:01.400 --> 03:43:04.040]  the normal measures you have to take your shoes off take your belt off take your
[03:43:04.040 --> 03:43:06.600]  laptop out there's a no sir you don't have to take your laptop out of your
[03:43:06.600 --> 03:43:09.080]  bag okay well take my belt you don't have to take your belt off
[03:43:09.080 --> 03:43:12.840]  so i'm like okay so just because there's a big event and you have a lot of traffic
[03:43:12.840 --> 03:43:16.120]  now all security measures have been suspended so and i walked through a
[03:43:16.120 --> 03:43:18.840]  metal detector i didn't have to go through the body scan which is good
[03:43:18.840 --> 03:43:22.600]  the way it should be but it's just like anytime there's a big event if there's
[03:43:22.600 --> 03:43:25.960]  an issue it's going to be there where the pope is not here yeah because they
[03:43:25.960 --> 03:43:28.840]  they have this huge traffic deal just like when josh and i came back from the
[03:43:28.840 --> 03:43:32.200]  super bowl they understood that if they start doing all the normal stupid
[03:43:32.200 --> 03:43:34.280]  pat downs that they do it's going to cloud the thing people
[03:43:34.280 --> 03:43:37.560]  going to miss their planes it's going to be a huge hubbub so they said no you
[03:43:37.560 --> 03:43:39.960]  don't have to unpack your laptop and all this stuff just goes straight to the
[03:43:39.960 --> 03:43:42.840]  line so i'm like why don't we just do that every day
[03:43:42.840 --> 03:43:45.560]  right instead of having to do this whole security it's just complete security
[03:43:45.560 --> 03:43:48.920]  theater complete security theater especially considering how locked down
[03:43:48.920 --> 03:43:51.320]  everything was yeah so that now all of a sudden
[03:43:51.320 --> 03:43:54.280]  you don't have to worry about the tsa at the airport no well you don't have to
[03:43:54.280 --> 03:43:57.000]  worry about tsa at the airport because they're patting people down on the
[03:43:57.000 --> 03:44:00.280]  streets of philadelphia and that's another point i wanted to get to it
[03:44:00.280 --> 03:44:04.040]  i think we have a clip guys of the the tsa and philly it is it's kind of a
[03:44:04.040 --> 03:44:06.440]  just a walking shot it's not the best footage i have some other footage back
[03:44:06.440 --> 03:44:09.320]  there but um yeah so we're walking down the
[03:44:09.320 --> 03:44:12.600]  street trying to get to our hotel and we see tsa out there checking people's
[03:44:12.600 --> 03:44:15.800]  bags patting people down this is like 11 o'clock in night
[03:44:15.800 --> 03:44:19.400]  just to walk down the street and then as i was saying yesterday on the
[03:44:19.400 --> 03:44:23.560]  on this show uh talking to alex you know they had to give us a wristband so we
[03:44:23.560 --> 03:44:26.680]  could get back to our hotel because if you didn't have a wristband you couldn't
[03:44:26.680 --> 03:44:30.200]  walk down the street so you needed basically a hall pass
[03:44:30.200 --> 03:44:33.080]  to walk down the street in the united states of america if you wanted to go
[03:44:33.080 --> 03:44:37.400]  to the event you had to get a tsa pat down or have your bag checks in or
[03:44:37.400 --> 03:44:41.320]  maybe possibly both and to show you leanne how ridiculous this security
[03:44:41.320 --> 03:44:44.680]  theater is we have some b-roll the barricades and all that other stuff
[03:44:44.680 --> 03:44:48.840]  they have these big concrete barricades you know nobody's going to drive through
[03:44:48.840 --> 03:44:52.040]  these things yeah you can see right there on your screen if you're watching
[03:44:52.040 --> 03:44:55.400]  on info wars.com forward slash yo and david night made a very good
[03:44:55.400 --> 03:44:59.880]  point you can see these barriers clear across the street and we saw one point
[03:44:59.880 --> 03:45:02.200]  some guys in a golf cart some cops in a golf cart
[03:45:02.200 --> 03:45:05.480]  were trying to figure out oh crap we blocked off the street how are we going
[03:45:05.480 --> 03:45:08.200]  to drive our golf cart the golf cart down the street
[03:45:08.200 --> 03:45:11.400]  and then they sat there and they thought about it for a second there's like oh
[03:45:11.400 --> 03:45:14.600]  we can drive on the sidewalk and david pointed out well if they can drive a
[03:45:14.600 --> 03:45:18.360]  golf cart on the sidewalk can't you drive a car on the sidewalk complete
[03:45:18.360 --> 03:45:23.000]  security theater and you can see how they have it all set up out here
[03:45:23.000 --> 03:45:27.160]  i bad bypassed this entire security perimeter they had national guard every
[03:45:27.160 --> 03:45:30.600]  alphabet agency you can think of local cops here's all that the whole
[03:45:30.600 --> 03:45:33.880]  shebang out there and they had people out there checking tickets and i wanted to
[03:45:33.880 --> 03:45:37.640]  go see the pope and independent square in philadelphia
[03:45:37.640 --> 03:45:41.320]  so what i did to bypass this entire security apparatus
[03:45:41.320 --> 03:45:45.400]  i walked around the people who were checking tickets walked up to the tsa
[03:45:45.400 --> 03:45:49.080]  walked into the event you got national guard everywhere you got
[03:45:49.080 --> 03:45:53.320]  snipers on the roof i walk into this event i walk around i'm taking selfies
[03:45:53.320 --> 03:45:57.480]  i put up multiple reports um sounds like a free man yeah yeah it sounds yeah
[03:45:57.480 --> 03:46:00.920]  here you can't you can't just do that stuff united states of america and one of
[03:46:00.920 --> 03:46:05.560]  the biggest the ironies while i was there leon at independence mall
[03:46:05.560 --> 03:46:09.080]  where the pope was speaking out there in philly they have this thing called the
[03:46:09.080 --> 03:46:12.280]  national constitution center the national constitution center
[03:46:12.280 --> 03:46:15.800]  and right in front of the national constitution center is what a tsa
[03:46:15.800 --> 03:46:19.960]  checkpoint so you have to go through the tsa checkpoint have your rights violated
[03:46:19.960 --> 03:46:22.920]  get patted down have them look through your bag and all this stuff to go in to
[03:46:22.920 --> 03:46:26.200]  see the national constitution center and that's just one area like we'll talk
[03:46:26.200 --> 03:46:29.160]  about all this irony we'll talk about what happened in new york we'll talk
[03:46:29.160 --> 03:46:31.720]  about what happened i guess we should have a little bit of time 1984
[03:46:31.720 --> 03:46:35.640]  well so what do you think i mean so like when the president comes to visit austin
[03:46:35.640 --> 03:46:39.240]  obviously it's not even that lockdown that shut down i don't have to have a
[03:46:39.240 --> 03:46:44.200]  wristband to get to and fro but also this is where the name of the area
[03:46:44.200 --> 03:46:47.320]  francisville yeah that's where the pope arrived that's the
[03:46:47.320 --> 03:46:50.360]  closest i got to that's probably about 30 yards or so away
[03:46:50.360 --> 03:46:54.280]  so in an area where i had no ticket i got that close to the pope
[03:46:54.280 --> 03:46:57.080]  and the thing about this is you were talking about when obama came
[03:46:57.080 --> 03:47:01.880]  pope mobile yeah when obama came to uh to austin kid and i went down there
[03:47:01.880 --> 03:47:05.080]  we got down to the university of texas where he is speaking he is i think
[03:47:05.080 --> 03:47:08.920]  you're speaking at the lbj library and we saw the motorcade like we could of
[03:47:08.920 --> 03:47:12.360]  course they're not going to let you any place near him but obama had less
[03:47:12.360 --> 03:47:15.880]  security in the city of austin texas obama has less security in
[03:47:15.880 --> 03:47:19.800]  washington dc than the pope had in philadelphia pennsylvania right
[03:47:19.800 --> 03:47:24.200]  and we don't rename our city after the president while he's here visiting
[03:47:24.200 --> 03:47:27.800]  so you know there's that whole separation of church and i want to
[03:47:27.800 --> 03:47:31.640]  make this very clear to people because i know you're like watching soundbites
[03:47:31.640 --> 03:47:35.320]  and seeing quick clips and all this stuff to get this in your mind if you
[03:47:35.320 --> 03:47:38.920]  if you even if you haven't been to time square new york
[03:47:38.920 --> 03:47:42.440]  i want people to understand that it was easier to move around in time square
[03:47:42.440 --> 03:47:45.640]  new york than it was to move around in philadelphia pennsylvania
[03:47:45.640 --> 03:47:49.240]  because the street was so blocked down or locked down because the pope was
[03:47:49.240 --> 03:47:52.200]  speaking at a madison square garden but there's a train station right
[03:47:52.200 --> 03:47:55.320]  underneath it so the cops you know i don't give too many
[03:47:55.320 --> 03:47:59.080]  compliments to the nypd that often but they had the foresight to recognize
[03:47:59.080 --> 03:48:02.200]  this is still a very public area so they did have barricades and stuff
[03:48:02.200 --> 03:48:04.840]  up but they still allow traffic to go through
[03:48:04.840 --> 03:48:08.040]  and madison square garden as opposed to the city of philadelphia
[03:48:08.040 --> 03:48:11.480]  concrete barriers like you cannot walk around i want to see the rocky statue i
[03:48:11.480 --> 03:48:14.760]  couldn't go see the rocky statue because they had the city locked down
[03:48:14.760 --> 03:48:18.680]  it was just that level of the highlight of your trip
[03:48:18.680 --> 03:48:22.040]  ruined they're denied well i did get to eat my philly cheesesteak which i was
[03:48:22.040 --> 03:48:24.760]  going to be really pissed off i didn't get to eat my philly cheesesteak in the
[03:48:24.760 --> 03:48:27.800]  city of philadelphia but yeah it's just a complete
[03:48:27.800 --> 03:48:30.840]  security theater in the back track and the quick time we have left before we
[03:48:30.840 --> 03:48:33.480]  have to come back with some phone calls
[03:48:33.480 --> 03:48:38.040]  but we were in washington dc david and i we were walking around and of course
[03:48:38.040 --> 03:48:40.920]  they had barriers around the white house but
[03:48:40.920 --> 03:48:44.360]  after the pope's speech was done and he went on to another area they quickly
[03:48:44.360 --> 03:48:47.320]  removed a lot of this stuff and then afterwards you could actually approach
[03:48:47.320 --> 03:48:49.960]  the white house fence of course you can't go up to the white house they have a
[03:48:49.960 --> 03:48:53.880]  gate around they open an area back up so you can get back up
[03:48:53.880 --> 03:48:57.160]  to uh to the white house area and it was the same thing around the city
[03:48:57.160 --> 03:48:59.800]  so the point i'm trying to make to everybody out there
[03:48:59.800 --> 03:49:03.640]  even though there is no obama in philly there was no united nations
[03:49:03.640 --> 03:49:08.120]  in philly i met daniel craig james bond was out there i saw the united nations
[03:49:08.120 --> 03:49:11.000]  even though none of that stuff was out there in philly they completely locked
[03:49:11.000 --> 03:49:14.600]  the city down for the security theater this show of force
[03:49:14.600 --> 03:49:18.760]  just in you can see the tsa patent that is in uh how big time the hope is and the
[03:49:18.760 --> 03:49:22.760]  influence if they would lock down these huge cities
[03:49:22.760 --> 03:49:26.120]  in this capacity for the pope and they don't even do those same things for
[03:49:26.120 --> 03:49:30.040]  yeah and watch i mean i want everybody to look at this this is tsa they're not
[03:49:30.040 --> 03:49:33.880]  at an airport they're not at a train station this is a public street in the
[03:49:33.880 --> 03:49:37.000]  united states of america they're checking people's bags they're
[03:49:37.000 --> 03:49:40.280]  patting people down do you want to live in a world like
[03:49:40.280 --> 03:49:42.600]  this where you have to get a freaking airport
[03:49:42.600 --> 03:49:46.920]  hat down to go to a public event because we already know they're doing tsa style
[03:49:46.920 --> 03:49:50.200]  back checks when you go to uh the super bowl or other sporting events can you
[03:49:50.200 --> 03:49:52.840]  imagine having to do something like this to go to a shopping mall if you know
[03:49:52.840 --> 03:49:56.280]  some celebrity shows up of course and you don't want to live in that world
[03:49:56.280 --> 03:49:59.080]  right and that's kind of the whole conditioning of it where we're going to
[03:49:59.080 --> 03:50:02.280]  be seeing these sort of things rolling out at sporting events and other things
[03:50:02.280 --> 03:50:05.720]  like this but i mean i don't i probably just wouldn't
[03:50:05.720 --> 03:50:10.280]  participate in those type of events where i mean but you said that they were
[03:50:10.280 --> 03:50:13.800]  making people show them their bags and things like that at 11 o'clock at night
[03:50:13.800 --> 03:50:16.440]  yeah i mean it's like it's not like something you could avoid it wasn't
[03:50:16.440 --> 03:50:19.480]  like you could just walk around it because the cab drivers were told they
[03:50:19.480 --> 03:50:22.520]  couldn't drive through certain parts of the area i have some footage i don't
[03:50:22.520 --> 03:50:26.760]  know if i put it in that folder but 11 i guess about 11 o'clock at night a
[03:50:26.760 --> 03:50:29.880]  friday night in philadelphia there's like a hundred people on the street
[03:50:29.880 --> 03:50:33.480]  in the bar and club area i mean that's how locked down the city was what would
[03:50:33.480 --> 03:50:37.640]  normally be a thriving economic boost for the community had been shut down
[03:50:37.640 --> 03:50:40.920]  just because the pope was in town right how do you party when the pope's in
[03:50:40.920 --> 03:50:44.280]  town i don't know about that but i guess the people
[03:50:44.280 --> 03:50:49.000]  that's what the plants crave right they can keep that i don't want anything to
[03:50:49.000 --> 03:50:51.560]  do with all that well we'll be right back rob do is

[03:54:22.760 --> 03:54:27.000]  going to go take very quickly your phone calls but before we get there i wanted
[03:54:27.000 --> 03:54:30.840]  to tell everyone to go to the info wars store and pick up knockout
[03:54:30.840 --> 03:54:35.560]  now we're introducing knockout it's the all natural sleep support formula by
[03:54:35.560 --> 03:54:39.480]  info wars life and i'm going to go ahead and read
[03:54:39.480 --> 03:54:43.400]  one of the reviews here this is from bob near the forest he says
[03:54:43.400 --> 03:54:47.640]  this blend is exceptional for years i have periodically taken valerian root
[03:54:47.640 --> 03:54:52.440]  or melatonin and get mixed effects and usually feel a jet lag style feeling
[03:54:52.440 --> 03:54:55.880]  the next day knockout worked over in over an hour and
[03:54:55.880 --> 03:54:58.920]  half and i felt very awake the next morning
[03:54:58.920 --> 03:55:01.640]  so i think i'm personally going to have to be getting some of this myself
[03:55:01.640 --> 03:55:05.400]  because i'm having a really hard time sleeping at night but it's got valerian
[03:55:05.400 --> 03:55:08.920]  root extract uh ga ba melatonin chamomile
[03:55:08.920 --> 03:55:14.520]  flour extract and many other compounds feel the punch of knockout today at
[03:55:14.520 --> 03:55:19.080]  info wars life dot com all right jacari jackson i want to go ahead and take
[03:55:19.080 --> 03:55:22.600]  uh a couple phone calls here very quickly let's talk to bob he's been
[03:55:22.600 --> 03:55:27.720]  holding there in connecticut hi leanne hey jacari how you doing you guys are
[03:55:27.720 --> 03:55:32.360]  the best oh thank you listen i was indoctrinated for five
[03:55:32.360 --> 03:55:38.120]  years at a catholic school when i was a second through sixth grade i figured
[03:55:38.120 --> 03:55:41.720]  there was something wrong with the hierarchy of the church way back then i
[03:55:41.720 --> 03:55:46.120]  bailed out of there after sixth grade i told my father i'm not going back
[03:55:46.120 --> 03:55:50.600]  anyway a few years later in high school i started really thinking about it and
[03:55:50.600 --> 03:55:54.040]  examine the history and the catholic church is
[03:55:54.040 --> 03:55:59.000]  essentially built on hypocrisy because all they did was go around the world
[03:55:59.000 --> 03:56:03.160]  with the spanish the portuguese uh and whoever
[03:56:03.160 --> 03:56:06.440]  they subjugated the people the indigenous peoples
[03:56:06.440 --> 03:56:11.480]  spent their wealth their resources turned them to the slaves converted them or
[03:56:11.480 --> 03:56:15.960]  killed them now at that point i was thinking well
[03:56:15.960 --> 03:56:19.080]  you know i think this whole thing is a sham i think this
[03:56:19.080 --> 03:56:23.000]  this religion this the the hierarchy of the church
[03:56:23.000 --> 03:56:26.760]  had uh perverted the message of jesus christ
[03:56:26.760 --> 03:56:31.080]  and now here and everything going on with this pope here uh francis
[03:56:31.080 --> 03:56:36.680]  the nazi from argentina uh you know this guy here
[03:56:36.680 --> 03:56:40.200]  i gotta believe jacar you've been a little easy on him
[03:56:40.200 --> 03:56:44.280]  i think he's probably the antichrist right now
[03:56:44.280 --> 03:56:47.640]  part of it you always have people who are you know
[03:56:47.640 --> 03:56:51.560]  antichrist a little a you know antichrist is just anything that's
[03:56:51.560 --> 03:56:55.160]  uh not christ you know so there are plenty of a
[03:56:55.160 --> 03:56:59.000]  little a antichrist in the world to say here that he's the i'm not prepared to
[03:56:59.000 --> 03:57:01.400]  make such a statement i don't know he's pretty powerful
[03:57:01.400 --> 03:57:04.520]  every scary movie i've ever watched that is about that
[03:57:04.520 --> 03:57:07.880]  it's always the catholic church it's the pope and the thing about that is
[03:57:07.880 --> 03:57:10.760]  speak more about the catholic church and the people who were you know at these
[03:57:10.760 --> 03:57:13.960]  events there were so many nice people at the event so i don't want to make any
[03:57:13.960 --> 03:57:17.080]  type of blanket statements you know talk about you know anybody who's a
[03:57:17.080 --> 03:57:20.280]  a follower of that religion they're very nice people out there of all races you
[03:57:20.280 --> 03:57:23.560]  know ages and all that stuff but i i would say that
[03:57:23.560 --> 03:57:27.560]  there is a uh if the pope makes statements like this all the time
[03:57:27.560 --> 03:57:30.680]  i'm very concerned for the catholic church can i really don't keep up with
[03:57:30.680 --> 03:57:33.880]  his activities until recently but if he makes statements like he's made
[03:57:33.880 --> 03:57:37.000]  over the past six days all the time i definitely have concerns for what's
[03:57:37.000 --> 03:57:40.120]  going on in that institution. Yeah exactly well thank you so much
[03:57:40.120 --> 03:57:43.720]  bob there in connecticut and and i agree it is definitely there is some
[03:57:43.720 --> 03:57:47.800]  transformation taking place uh the pope is kind of heading it up at
[03:57:47.800 --> 03:57:51.800]  this point he's totally tied into the un's 2030 agenda
[03:57:51.800 --> 03:57:55.560]  transforming the world uh about one minute jacquard jackson you're gonna be on
[03:57:55.560 --> 03:57:58.520]  the info wars nightly news tonight tell us what we got coming up

[03:58:02.280 --> 03:58:05.320]  going to recap in a little more detail with a few more
[03:58:05.320 --> 03:58:08.760]  clips uh our trip over the past six days documenting
[03:58:08.760 --> 03:58:11.880]  the pope coming to america all the police measures that came out i think
[03:58:11.880 --> 03:58:15.480]  it was very much what ron manuel talks about don't let a good crisis go to
[03:58:15.480 --> 03:58:18.600]  waste there was a great time for the military industrial complex
[03:58:18.600 --> 03:58:21.480]  they made a lot of money they put a lot of troops out on the street they put a
[03:58:21.480 --> 03:58:24.760]  lot of barricades had a bunch of m wraps so i'm pretty sure they were very
[03:58:24.760 --> 03:58:28.040]  happy at the show and tell they got to do while the pope was here
[03:58:28.040 --> 03:58:31.480]  so you don't like that tyranny all right jacquard jackson well that's coming up
