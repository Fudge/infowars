[00:00.000 --> 00:16.260]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you from the front lines of the
[00:16.260 --> 00:25.340]  info war coming up evidence is mounting judge Napolitano covered it
[00:25.340 --> 00:29.740]  yesterday new documents are coming out Obama went outside the chain of command
[00:29.740 --> 00:35.680]  to illegally spy on candidate and then president-elect Trump of course he did
[00:35.680 --> 00:39.680]  they admitted that they had the intercepts months ago claiming he was
[00:39.680 --> 00:42.520]  talking to the Russians of course we found out nothing substantive was being
[00:42.520 --> 00:47.080]  discussed except normal meetings that were being set up that's what an interim
[00:47.080 --> 00:55.080]  president-elect would do but that's coming up to take a line from Mark
[00:55.080 --> 00:59.520]  Dyson the video we've got coming up Rachel Maddow engages in the biggest
[00:59.520 --> 01:06.000]  piece of hyped-up media since Geraldo went into Al Capone's vault with his
[01:06.000 --> 01:13.740]  big drumroll over Trump tax returns and then it turns out the tax returns have
[01:13.740 --> 01:20.280]  been released before and it turns out that Trump paid more taxes that year
[01:20.280 --> 01:28.480]  than Barack Obama and the list goes on and on so it's all coming up today we
[01:28.480 --> 01:36.080]  have a full slate of guests joining us we have Paul Joseph Watson coming on in
[01:36.080 --> 01:40.080]  about 30 minutes Twitter admits they're openly censoring info wars now and gives
[01:40.080 --> 01:45.320]  moto the big technology entertainment site has come out and celebrated it said
[01:45.320 --> 01:50.760]  absolutely just completely ban us wow isn't that nice so so-called free press
[01:50.760 --> 01:55.400]  you'd never think you'd hear press calling for banning people but they're
[01:55.400 --> 01:59.160]  doing it ladies and gentlemen they're doing it because they can't compete with
[01:59.160 --> 02:04.240]  us wow they truly are the opposition party the mainstream media is the
[02:04.240 --> 02:07.320]  opposition party and they want to shut free press down because they can't
[02:07.320 --> 02:11.920]  compete with us they're just outrageous hey sorry you didn't get Hillary in so
[02:11.920 --> 02:15.040]  your whole launch of censorship gonna blow up in your face and it is blowing
[02:15.040 --> 02:19.400]  up and I've got a little newsflash for you our traffic's up and a lot of it's
[02:19.400 --> 02:22.880]  because people now realize we're being censored and they say what is it we
[02:22.880 --> 02:27.000]  better go look at it we've got the Federal Elections Commission and others
[02:27.000 --> 02:30.960]  saying they want to censor drudge as well and we've got the quote inventor of
[02:30.960 --> 02:33.960]  the internet no not Al Gore but the real inventor of it over in England saying
[02:33.960 --> 02:40.680]  ban any political speech online as campaigning wow so Paul Joseph Watson's
[02:40.680 --> 02:45.720]  coming on Craig Sawyer very famous Navy SEAL I'm not gonna even say what SEAL
[02:45.720 --> 02:49.920]  team he was in or what he did or what he had it up but with the one of pimp the
[02:49.920 --> 02:53.960]  Trident but he's really helping us push the idea to get the veterans and the
[02:53.960 --> 02:57.920]  troops out openly saying they support the commander-in-chief and that is the
[02:57.920 --> 03:00.320]  law if you're in the military already currently but certainly if you're a
[03:00.320 --> 03:04.320]  veteran this president's really doing about a 95% job right now better than
[03:04.320 --> 03:08.640]  any president I've seen a long time he'd be at a hundred percent but the Paul
[03:08.640 --> 03:13.120]  Ryan healthcare bill put a little dent in the cloak of invincibility of Trump I
[03:13.120 --> 03:15.640]  just got to be honest with you about that but it is better to Obamacare and I
[03:15.640 --> 03:19.640]  get he wants to have a victory and it's gonna implode the economy Obamacare is
[03:19.640 --> 03:22.680]  designed to implode the economy in the next year it's designed to Obama
[03:22.680 --> 03:25.920]  admitted that it's in the memos so Trump's like look I just got to get a deal
[03:25.920 --> 03:29.360]  and get something a little better or maybe a lot better so it doesn't blow up
[03:29.360 --> 03:33.360]  the whole economy I get it but you just can't compromise with Paul Ryan and
[03:33.360 --> 03:38.760]  people drudgereport.com has a big top link on the left-hand side savage it's a
[03:38.760 --> 03:45.160]  powerful interview a GOP traders blocking Trump Ryan McCain trying to save
[03:45.160 --> 03:50.640]  Obamacare from Trump reform from the American people I would add so that's

[04:06.040 --> 04:08.440]  prime minister of the Netherlands you're the prime minister of foreigners and
[04:08.440 --> 04:13.560]  globalist colonization which is exactly what it is then James O'Keefe will be
[04:13.560 --> 04:18.840]  joining us the great investigative journalist at Sleuth who's also being
[04:18.840 --> 04:21.840]  called fake news because he's so game-changing and world-changing and

[05:14.920 --> 05:19.880]  substance that the FDA defines as a drug when used to prevent disease because
[05:19.880 --> 05:25.080]  unlike the minerals we need humans have no known physiological requirement for
[05:25.080 --> 05:30.240]  fluoride sodium fluoride long known as an effective roach poison is added to

[05:35.240 --> 05:39.680]  fluoride is not a nutritional supplement it is a prescription drug and a
[05:39.680 --> 05:45.080]  dangerous one FDA recently announced that marketing fluoride drops and tablets
[05:45.080 --> 05:50.240]  for cavity prevention violates federal law because FDA never approved these

[08:11.000 --> 08:34.600]  it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war I normally
[08:34.600 --> 08:39.080]  just kind of mentioned at the end of a segment or the end of an hour that hey
[08:39.080 --> 08:50.280]  infowars.com is being demonized and attacked by thousands of major
[08:50.280 --> 08:55.360]  news publications a month conservatively by every news channel that's
[08:55.360 --> 09:01.200]  establishment and corporate by every major entertainment show that's late
[09:01.200 --> 09:08.600]  night comedy 60 minutes Saturday night live a homeland everything's negative
[09:08.600 --> 09:13.840]  everything's lies everything's distortions but Chris Carter and last
[09:13.840 --> 09:18.320]  year's mini series return of the X files that was a big hit notice it hasn't
[09:18.320 --> 09:23.840]  been brought back yet I guess but it had record ratings for that year one of
[09:23.840 --> 09:33.960]  the second highest rated show last year and you notice that Chris Carter said I
[09:33.960 --> 09:38.560]  like Alex Jones he's a libertarian he's not a racist globalism's real a lot of
[09:38.560 --> 09:41.440]  the topics he talks about you can document and we're basing a lot of
[09:41.440 --> 09:46.560]  these episodes on Alex Jones's research we have a character that's Alex Jones
[09:46.560 --> 09:52.800]  and I was very pleased and honored to actually see someone say what the series
[09:52.800 --> 10:00.760]  was about admit it was based on a lot of our research and to just be honest
[10:00.760 --> 10:05.880]  everything else in MSM is basically a lie in fact I don't know why I agreed to
[10:05.880 --> 10:10.240]  talk to Derspiegel I thought oh it's far and press Derspiegel's pretty big
[10:10.240 --> 10:14.920]  Derspiegel did expose the CIA running a bunch of the German media a few years
[10:14.920 --> 10:19.400]  ago but they also put out hit pieces and I said fine I'll talk to the you know
[10:19.400 --> 10:22.800]  the German guy just like I've talked to the Russians and the Japanese you know
[10:22.800 --> 10:28.920]  it's kind of alien it's kind of sexy it's it's different and the guy comes here
[10:28.920 --> 10:32.960]  and says that I said want to suck my sausage trying to give him a piece of
[10:32.960 --> 10:36.840]  sausage I don't talk like that to women around here much less men no one in the
[10:36.840 --> 10:43.160]  office bought that I said that I had spilled barbecue sauce on my shirt and
[10:43.160 --> 10:45.840]  I was like taking it off and walking around like oh your shirt's off that's
[10:45.840 --> 10:48.520]  coming on my office and I said oh yeah you want to just do it like oh yeah let's
[10:48.520 --> 10:53.000]  take photos let's do it like that but just turned into something like that like
[10:53.000 --> 10:56.000]  there's a photo of me horseback riding my shirt off it's like Alex wants us to
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.560]  see that his shirts off why is he always shirtless I did one skit where I
[11:00.560 --> 11:04.560]  talked about the IRS taking so much of your money you got to be shirtless so
[11:04.560 --> 11:08.120]  I probably done five six shirtless skits in 20-something years yeah okay big deal
[11:08.120 --> 11:15.400]  but now that's the big archetype I'm the shirtless guy but I'm digressing I
[11:16.040 --> 11:20.520]  cannot it be interviewed by mainstream media anymore unless it's live
[11:20.520 --> 11:24.520]  television because hey they don't have that many readers or viewers so what's
[11:24.520 --> 11:32.120]  the point but also because they lie they only use access to you to say
[11:32.120 --> 11:36.760]  something about you that isn't true that's why Trump more and more doesn't
[11:36.760 --> 11:43.040]  talk to him because there's no humanity there there's only a mission to shut you
[11:43.040 --> 11:47.280]  up or misrepresent you so I normally just mentioned as a side we're being
[11:47.280 --> 11:51.160]  censored we're being attacked but I have to say up front the start of the
[11:51.160 --> 11:59.560]  broadcast today that it's really getting intense almost all of Paul Watson's
[11:59.560 --> 12:08.760]  articles now on my Facebook and on his Facebook are being deleted and Facebook
[12:08.760 --> 12:14.960]  is saying that it's not real news and or it's fake and look at Gizmodo today
[12:14.960 --> 12:20.920]  Facebook pulls major boner marks in fours articles is spam instead of BS
[12:20.920 --> 12:27.360]  and then they show the articles that they are banning and we showed the
[12:27.360 --> 12:34.160]  Colbert report and John Oliver and others making fun of Conway saying that
[12:34.160 --> 12:39.680]  there are appliances in your house that the government corporation spy on you
[12:39.680 --> 12:44.400]  through the smart grid that's an admitted incontrovertible fact that I
[12:44.400 --> 12:48.280]  talked about 18 years ago that was in Wired magazine three years ago with the
[12:48.280 --> 12:51.720]  CIA director at the time talking about it he said yeah your dishwasher we're
[12:51.720 --> 12:56.040]  gonna watch you and listen to your dishwasher and so they make fun of her
[12:56.040 --> 13:01.520]  and we show screenshots of the articles links documents vault seven and say see
[13:01.520 --> 13:06.040]  they think you're dumb and because we're right and because we're getting too much
[13:06.040 --> 13:09.760]  credibility because we told everybody this over and over again they have to
[13:09.760 --> 13:15.640]  delete us and then have other so-called news publications cheer lead like we're
[13:15.640 --> 13:21.600]  in communist China the shutdown of free press talk about disgraceful talk about
[13:21.600 --> 13:26.200]  dangerous talk about being sellouts this is the very definition of it and it's
[13:26.200 --> 13:31.960]  despicable and it shows they'll they'll I mean I bet if Hillary would have got
[13:31.960 --> 13:37.400]  in and she would have had me arrested and publicly executed Gizmodo would have
[13:37.400 --> 13:40.880]  an article how great it was and let's let's kill more patriots and more
[13:40.880 --> 13:44.320]  right-wingers I'm serious that's the attitude they've got they're all over the
[13:44.320 --> 13:48.160]  news saying kill Donald Trump Snoop Dogg comes out and says kill Donald Trump
[13:48.160 --> 13:52.640]  puts a video out promoting it says kill cops spray cops with bullets is one
[13:52.640 --> 13:57.520]  line and the media made fun of Trump tweeting saying hey somebody else we
[13:57.520 --> 14:01.400]  get jail time for this if somebody said this about Obama and they all over the
[14:01.400 --> 14:06.040]  news making jokes about it all Trump what's wrong with saying kill ya don't be
[14:06.040 --> 14:14.400]  a your source sport and what they are is a bunch of failing babies a bunch of want
[14:14.400 --> 14:19.880]  to be tough guys and want to be trendies who are the past they're the opposite of
[14:19.880 --> 14:26.800]  cool the opposite of cutting-edge they're a joke by every
[14:28.800 --> 14:34.520]  angle you look at it it is kind of funny though I'm like there aren't many
[14:34.520 --> 14:38.600]  places me my shirt off and then puts up info wars.com your radio lister and
[14:38.600 --> 14:42.160]  there's an ad for a supermail my telly with my shirt off so I guess they're
[14:42.160 --> 14:45.440]  brought back one of the ads randomly because it gets higher clicks than the
[14:45.440 --> 14:51.800]  other ones I it's preposterous to say I take my shirt off boom there it is I
[14:51.800 --> 14:59.960]  guess broken clocks are still right twice a day aren't they so Facebook pulls
[14:59.960 --> 15:03.360]  major boner marks info wars articles and spam and they go through here and
[15:03.360 --> 15:08.840]  celebrate shutting us down and then they say oh cuz look he said Michelle is a
[15:08.840 --> 15:14.160]  tranny no that was a giant internet meme after Joan Rivers said it and she was
[15:14.160 --> 15:19.800]  dead a month later remember Joan Rivers said that we did a report on that and
[15:19.800 --> 15:25.400]  again they turned it into we created it we gave birth to it we generated it we
[15:25.400 --> 15:32.840]  were the authors of it and we weren't so again it's about lying lying lying it's
[15:32.840 --> 15:37.160]  time to ban him because he said she was a tranny
[15:37.880 --> 15:43.160]  meanwhile CNN says Iraq has WMD's and millions die oh but they're still being
[15:43.160 --> 15:46.280]  spread their real news even though they've been caught in their own memos
[15:46.280 --> 15:51.280]  manipulating the whole campaign for Hillary and all the other things CNN's
[15:51.280 --> 15:55.840]  been caught doing faking being on locations all over the world I mean it's
[15:55.840 --> 16:00.800]  a joke what they do at Time Warner they're so discredited they now call
[16:00.800 --> 16:12.200]  themselves spectrum yes a spectrum of lies and disinformation now before I go
[16:12.200 --> 16:19.280]  any further to talk about fake news this is out of DW glifosate no car
[16:19.280 --> 16:24.080]  sentences EU agency the EU's chemical agency has concluded that one of the
[16:24.080 --> 16:27.440]  world's most widely used weed killers glifosate cannot be classified as a
[16:27.440 --> 16:32.800]  carcinogen it's contained in Monsanto's best-selling herbicide cold roamed up
[16:32.800 --> 16:40.080]  ladies and gentlemen they have whole classes of cancers that are known as in
[16:40.080 --> 16:46.040]  layman's terms hormone fueled cancers or hormone based cancers and the glifosate
[16:46.040 --> 16:56.600]  mimics female hormones and so it disrupts the sexual activity in mammals in
[16:56.600 --> 17:05.320]  plants in amphibians in in aquatic life you name it I mean if you think it
[17:05.320 --> 17:09.560]  disrupts and kills weeds what do you think it does to you you think of
[17:09.560 --> 17:15.680]  something kills a plant do you think it's good for you just just asking I mean
[17:15.680 --> 17:19.320]  I'm sure they'll have an article going it's fake news he says you can't drink
[17:19.320 --> 17:22.280]  roundup and then it's not healthy yeah they used to say you could drink roundup
[17:22.280 --> 17:25.480]  till they get tried to get the lobbyist that always had said that for two
[17:25.480 --> 17:27.880]  decades to drink it and he said hell no I'm not gonna drink that you think I'm
[17:27.880 --> 17:34.880]  crazy because if you drink a big glass of roundup it'll kill most people if you
[17:34.880 --> 17:38.640]  drink enough of it'll definitely kill you down the road I mean it's bad it's
[17:38.640 --> 17:43.640]  weed killer folks weed killer isn't good for you and it's been used by the
[17:43.640 --> 17:48.080]  hundreds of billions of gallons you know I forget I don't want to go for
[17:48.080 --> 17:52.480]  memory they'll call that an exaggeration guys search engine worldwide use of
[17:52.480 --> 18:00.040]  glifosate how much glifosate has been used in the world it's it's it's in the
[18:00.040 --> 18:04.480]  tons I know it's in them I think I want to say the hundreds of millions of
[18:04.480 --> 18:10.840]  tons which is more than billions of gallons oh but see I'm fake news I just
[18:10.840 --> 18:14.760]  mentioned the famous lobbyist saying that and my crew already had it on TV for
[18:14.760 --> 18:19.080]  viewers to see it so so so let's start with that let's queue that up and play
[18:19.080 --> 18:22.720]  and then I'll get into all the new news that is breaking but we're not liberal
[18:22.720 --> 18:27.000]  we're not conservative if there's a thousand plus studies going back 30 plus
[18:27.000 --> 18:32.080]  years that glifosate is one of the main causes of cancer and finally the UN does
[18:32.080 --> 18:35.160]  the right thing and finally California does the right thing they do some right
[18:35.160 --> 18:40.640]  things and liberal institutions and come out and say this stuff's really bad
[18:44.480 --> 18:49.720]  we're going to cover it here ladies and gentlemen glifosate now the most used
[18:49.720 --> 18:53.360]  agricultural chemical ever yeah let's let's read from Newsweek how much they
[18:53.360 --> 18:56.800]  say it's been used I mean I know it's just it's just absolutely when you hear
[18:56.800 --> 19:00.080]  the number it's just phenomenal
[19:00.080 --> 19:06.360]  9.4 million tons I was saying millions of tons billions of gallons I don't know
[19:06.360 --> 19:10.280]  that's I was going for memory 9.4 million tons of the chemical have been
[19:10.280 --> 19:14.920]  sprayed on the fields for comparison that equivalent to the weight of water is
[19:14.920 --> 19:19.760]  more than 200 or no two thousand three hundred two thousand three hundred
[19:19.760 --> 19:24.960]  Olympic-sized swimming pools it's also enough to spray nearly half a pound of
[19:24.960 --> 19:31.440]  roundup on every cultivated acre of land in the world that's from a 2015 report
[19:31.440 --> 19:36.720]  we're gonna skip this break do we have that clip of the famous lobbyist of it
[19:36.720 --> 19:42.240]  yeah here it is from the CBC Canadian television here it is
[19:42.240 --> 19:47.760]  I believe that glyphosate in Argentina is causing increases in cancer you can
[19:47.760 --> 19:51.880]  drink a whole quart of it and it won't hurt you are you want to drink some we
[19:51.880 --> 19:56.520]  have some here I'd be happy to actually not not really but not really I know it
[19:56.520 --> 20:02.200]  wouldn't hurt me if you say so I have some no I'm not stupid okay so you you
[20:02.200 --> 20:05.800]  know but I know it's dangerous I know I know people try to commit suicide with
[20:05.800 --> 20:11.040]  it and fail fairly regularly it's not dangerous to humans no it's not so are
[20:11.040 --> 20:16.120]  you ready to drink one glass of no I'm not an idiot interview me about golden
[20:16.120 --> 20:19.640]  rice that's what I'm talking about okay then it's finished except then the
[20:19.640 --> 20:24.600]  interview is finished let's say that's a good way to solve things yeah you're a
[20:24.600 --> 20:30.520]  complete jerk by the way you notice he said people try to commit suicide with
[20:30.520 --> 20:34.920]  it and fail pretty regularly yeah if you've got tough kidneys and a tough
[20:34.920 --> 20:39.120]  liver it'll kill you in a month two months you got to try again that's
[20:39.120 --> 20:44.600]  because it's been reported in India the numbers vary between 800 and a million
[20:44.600 --> 20:48.840]  and a half 800,000 a million and a half you can look this up see my memory is
[20:48.840 --> 20:55.520]  correct farmers have drunk it to die when it ends up ruining their crops and
[20:55.520 --> 20:59.320]  they can't make money on it using it in their crops they they drink it
[20:59.320 --> 21:05.440]  particularly cotton farmers so here let's do that let's Google
[21:05.600 --> 21:10.720]  Indian farmers committing suicide by drinking pesticide this is one of the
[21:10.720 --> 21:17.800]  main ones they do but but you hurting oh they fail pretty regularly this is a
[21:17.800 --> 21:21.960]  guy that famously went around the lobbyist all over the world and told
[21:21.960 --> 21:27.720]  people you can drink it and it's safe but these reporters figured he'd say that
[21:27.720 --> 21:31.720]  so they actually had a glass right there and he wouldn't do it yeah because
[21:31.720 --> 21:36.840]  having your liver and kidneys shut down and dying it's not very fun is it no oh
[21:36.840 --> 21:42.760]  but see we're the fake news ladies and gentlemen we can't be allowed to be here
[21:42.760 --> 21:47.000]  so I'm gonna get back to this for you we're winning worldwide nationalism is
[21:47.000 --> 21:52.120]  exploding Gert Wilders is ahead in the polls right now as the Dutch begin to
[21:52.120 --> 21:56.920]  go to the polls today the pen is ahead in the polls but then they have some new
[21:56.920 --> 22:00.920]  national polls being skewed that internet polls and more scientific polls
[22:00.920 --> 22:03.920]  don't match showing she's neck and neck so they're trying to steal the election
[22:03.920 --> 22:08.640]  but a lot is unfolding we'll be watching the Dutch election polls live today and
[22:08.640 --> 22:11.880]  tonight on the nightly news we'll have all the results by then as Gert Wilders
[22:11.880 --> 22:19.680]  takes on Mark Root in the Netherlands so that's all unfolding Wilders against the
[22:19.680 --> 22:27.760]  globalist trader Paul Watson joins us at the bottom of the hour to discuss the
[22:27.760 --> 22:33.280]  fact that Twitter officially and Facebook as well are blocking our articles
[22:33.280 --> 22:36.720]  and just deleting them again I noticed this about a month ago because I'd be
[22:36.720 --> 22:40.640]  like well look at this video I had 14 million views and it'd be gone and I
[22:40.640 --> 22:44.680]  sort of noticing any video that got five six seven million views they would
[22:44.680 --> 22:47.880]  delete first it was one that had 14 million then I'd see one those five or
[22:47.880 --> 22:51.000]  six should just be gone because they were just gonna keep going to 30 40 50
[22:51.000 --> 22:56.040]  million views see oh we can't have that because you know hundreds of millions of
[22:56.040 --> 22:59.960]  dollars a year spent propping up CNN tens of millions of dollars a year's are
[22:59.960 --> 23:04.960]  spent propping up shows like the Colbert report and if they only have a couple
[23:04.960 --> 23:08.280]  million viewers a night and then we could sit here and have tens of millions of
[23:08.280 --> 23:11.840]  viewers every day on Facebook I mean they just can't allow that because they're
[23:11.840 --> 23:16.000]  in charge they're the boss they're popular they're the they're the leaders
[23:16.000 --> 23:19.560]  they're the arrogant people in their big fancy studios in New York and LA
[23:19.560 --> 23:26.400]  lecturing you know the dumb flyover country the hayseeds the working people
[23:26.400 --> 23:30.480]  the Christians the gun owners and they're gonna beat us they're gonna open our
[23:30.480 --> 23:33.720]  borders they're gonna bring in a foreign populations they're gonna drive down the
[23:33.720 --> 23:36.520]  wages they're gonna make us be renters they're gonna get us out of our cars
[23:36.520 --> 23:40.680]  they're gonna make us be slaves they're gonna teach us and it doesn't matter if
[23:40.680 --> 23:43.960]  they're not popular and hated they're just gonna come in and shut us up
[23:43.960 --> 23:49.520]  because they're the liberals so it's okay no through the dirt bag
[23:49.520 --> 23:54.280]  authoritarians allied with the other authoritarian scum like Paul Ryan John
[23:54.280 --> 24:01.040]  McCain Mitch McConnell and all the other trash who are the literal enemies of this
[24:01.040 --> 24:07.280]  country I love drudge report calm the way drudge puts it all you should have
[24:07.280 --> 24:09.960]  one of our reporters just kind of go off this is a road now and do a report on it
[24:09.960 --> 24:13.760]  kind of like mark dice did as he just laughs at every piece of this Trump paid
[24:13.760 --> 24:20.000]  higher tax rate 25% than MSNBC Comcast 24 much higher than Obama who paid that
[24:20.000 --> 24:24.880]  same year 19% and Bernie who paid 13 oh most of the big liberals I know never
[24:24.880 --> 24:31.440]  pay taxes there they're always just I mean people all know that 38 million
[24:31.440 --> 24:35.320]  dollars on a hundred and fifty million dollars he made CNBC turns on sister
[24:35.320 --> 24:43.840]  network Rachel veers off course quest for ratings total stunt yesterday the
[24:43.840 --> 24:52.920]  aides of Maddow he says is it that amazing oh look over here on drudge thanks
[24:52.920 --> 24:59.640]  a billion drudge ranked number two views in all of media yeah I haven't clicked
[24:59.640 --> 25:04.040]  this yet but it's always saying they're yahoo or Google has more and that's
[25:04.040 --> 25:09.040]  basically yahoo you know just has so many email users and so many web
[25:09.040 --> 25:14.280]  addresses but let's say who's number one now because it'll have it all listed
[25:14.280 --> 25:20.680]  here yeah number number number two and news just got Twitter AOL Reddit Fox
[25:20.680 --> 25:28.200]  News see it in that's magazine CC then everyone tell you who's number one because
[25:28.200 --> 25:32.360]  it's too embarrassing for them so they hide the fact that drudge is really
[25:32.360 --> 25:36.440]  number number one till later they only have the categories of little of lesser
[25:36.440 --> 25:39.800]  categories and put them up front to make MSM look big that's how they do it but
[25:39.800 --> 25:50.440]  look MSN.com is number one drudge is number two in the entire world and
[25:50.440 --> 25:52.840]  that's the great thing about it you know they're starting to censor us
[25:52.840 --> 25:55.880]  everywhere and that's why I value drudge even more than ever because you know
[25:55.880 --> 26:00.920]  what drudge links to our reports when he knows they're important and so just
[26:00.920 --> 26:04.520]  thank God for drudge report or they would be able to quietly I guess try to
[26:04.520 --> 26:07.800]  strangle info wars and try to silence you as well let's go back to the main
[26:07.800 --> 26:12.480]  page of drudge report.com just like this noteworthy they've been trying to
[26:12.480 --> 26:15.560]  censor Michael Savage been trying to block his books and bookstores are
[26:15.560 --> 26:19.000]  trying to keep him off the air he's banned all over Fox CNN he's banned
[26:19.000 --> 26:24.600]  to flying to the UK but I guess he's not banned on drudge report and guess who
[26:24.600 --> 26:31.720]  else isn't savage Republican traders blocking Trump info wars.com right
[26:31.720 --> 26:35.720]  there so now we can get this out and fight back against this bad health care
[26:35.720 --> 26:40.440]  bill that is so close to falling apart. You can get an actual repeal like
[26:40.440 --> 26:43.640]  Rand Paul's posting like Trump said he was originally four and still says he
[26:43.640 --> 26:47.560]  supports he just doesn't want to look obstructionary so it's going okay great
[26:47.560 --> 26:50.360]  you know let's at least repeal it because it will wreck the economy in the next
[26:50.360 --> 26:53.640]  year if we don't it's designed to blow the economy up it always was it's in the
[26:53.640 --> 26:58.760]  wiki links it was the crater of it the Z killer manual you admit it's meant to
[26:58.760 --> 27:03.080]  bankrupt the system and then bring in a socialist system so I get what Trump's
[27:03.080 --> 27:05.840]  doing I just don't think it's the best way to do it but hey he knows more than I
[27:05.840 --> 27:10.160]  do he's up there I just have to say I agree with Rand Paul and in drudge
[27:10.160 --> 27:14.000]  agrees and you know pretty much all the talk show hosts and our listeners agree
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.280]  with us I mean don't you think we should just repeal it that people don't want to
[27:16.280 --> 27:18.960]  have health care that's their issue and then this should be charity care
[27:18.960 --> 27:23.200]  hospitals that claim their tax exempt but then sit there and make taxpayers pay
[27:23.200 --> 27:28.120]  for all this crap the hospitals aren't doing their jobs the tax exempt hospitals
[27:28.120 --> 27:31.920]  are sucking off the public and off the insurance companies and vice versa that's
[27:31.920 --> 27:39.480]  that's the inside scoop folks okay I'm an expert on it and it just goes on from
[27:39.480 --> 27:46.720]  there DOJ charges Russian spies criminal hackers in Yahoo breach but how do
[27:46.720 --> 27:51.280]  you even know that's true because we know in the vault seven release that they
[27:51.280 --> 27:57.160]  were framing the Russians with malware malware that they were blaming the
[27:57.160 --> 28:02.800]  Russians with so how do we believe any of this oh by the way the intelligence
[28:02.800 --> 28:09.440]  committee has come out and said no evidence of wiretapping the archaic
[28:09.440 --> 28:14.320]  term of President Trump but then meanwhile the New York Times and every
[28:14.320 --> 28:19.280]  other major publication a month ago going back to January 20th all said they
[28:19.280 --> 28:25.120]  have intercepts and have been tapping Trump Tower and listing the
[28:25.120 --> 28:28.600]  communications that had transcripts of General Flynn then they turn around and
[28:28.600 --> 28:33.160]  say oh we never said that we never did that and the New York Times retracts
[28:33.160 --> 28:37.680]  the claim that there were wiretaps how you retract it when you have the
[28:37.680 --> 28:47.000]  transcript that you use to say Flynn was lying even that was a hoax remember he
[28:47.000 --> 28:51.160]  didn't discuss the sanctions he they asked him well will the sanctions be on
[28:51.160 --> 28:53.320]  the agenda and he said it'll be whatever you want to discuss with the
[28:53.320 --> 28:57.960]  president you know he wants an open clean slate the Russians are like well
[28:57.960 --> 29:01.960]  we'll talk about sanctions okay talk to him lining up the phone calls that's
[29:01.960 --> 29:06.560]  what your national security advisor does when you're lining up a call with the
[29:06.560 --> 29:10.520]  other head of state Flynn was doing a job but see that's a lie within a lie
[29:10.520 --> 29:14.200]  within a lie with a lie they're all over the news they think you're done they
[29:14.200 --> 29:18.720]  think you don't remember 55 days ago when Trump was getting inaugurated the
[29:18.720 --> 29:22.040]  cover of the New York Times and the big story that they've got the intercepts
[29:22.040 --> 29:25.040]  they were tappeting the intelligence agencies were listening to the
[29:25.040 --> 29:32.200]  president-elect and you know what he's a liar we got him the New York Times that
[29:32.200 --> 29:40.320]  told us there were WMDs in Iraq the fake news scum MSM is incredible coming up
[29:40.320 --> 29:45.160]  Paul Joseph Watson on censorship Maddow having it blow up in her face with all
[29:45.160 --> 29:48.600]  her hype garbage on tax returns that had already been out for years stay with us
[29:48.600 --> 29:57.120]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:59.000 --> 30:04.960]  we have the new product and enforce life comm bio true selenium we've had so
[30:04.960 --> 30:09.240]  many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able
[30:09.240 --> 30:14.800]  to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed
[30:14.800 --> 30:19.360]  extract when you take selenium in the body it actually benefits the detoxification
[30:19.360 --> 30:24.240]  systems in your body it helps balance the thyroid gland it helps detoxify
[30:24.240 --> 30:28.120]  selenium is another one of those absolute must-have the highest
[30:28.120 --> 30:31.640]  concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland but it's actually used
[30:31.640 --> 30:35.840]  all over the body as a matter of fact there's 25 genes in the body that are
[30:35.840 --> 30:42.600]  directly dependent upon selenium so it really is a all-around nutrient that
[30:42.600 --> 30:47.360]  everybody really needs I'm taking it now every day this is soaking bio true
[30:47.360 --> 30:51.120]  selenium is the product the best selenium that we could bring you we

[32:17.000 --> 32:21.680]  a medical doctor because I just knew they would give me a cover-up pill I
[32:21.680 --> 32:25.960]  didn't want to get on to that sort of thing at all when I learned it was

[32:59.560 --> 33:16.360]  Well Craig Sawyer is one of the most famous Navy SEALs out there but he
[33:16.360 --> 33:20.360]  obviously won't get it to anything he was involved in and what SEAL teams he was
[33:20.360 --> 33:24.240]  into the things he did but he certainly is aware of what's going on in the
[33:24.240 --> 33:29.200]  government and is aware of a lot of other things we'll just start leaving it
[33:29.200 --> 33:34.640]  that I don't know how far he's gonna go on air today into some of the things that
[33:34.640 --> 33:40.200]  he's privately told me none of it classified but just about the fact that
[33:40.200 --> 33:46.240]  there is a serious civil war going on inside the government and the majority
[33:46.240 --> 33:50.800]  of the CIA actually wants to save the country wants to destroy globalism and
[33:50.800 --> 33:57.160]  is not like what's happening and so just understand that's why the media is
[33:57.160 --> 34:00.280]  promoting killing Trump because there's major moves in that direction to kill the
[34:00.280 --> 34:04.240]  president so he's also got obvious warnings to President Trump who's
[34:04.240 --> 34:07.320]  saying God is coming out making a big deal out of Snoop Dogg saying kill him
[34:07.320 --> 34:11.040]  and having a rap video where they say you know you see the pigs you see the
[34:11.040 --> 34:17.080]  clowns you spray him with the gun you you know you sprayed Trump shows him get
[34:17.080 --> 34:22.880]  the gun go out shoot the president so illegal organizing the murder of the
[34:22.880 --> 34:32.920]  elected president can you imagine what would happen if this was Obama so Mr.
[34:32.920 --> 34:37.360]  Sawyer is gonna be in here Mr. Sawyer is gonna be in here in the next hour

[34:45.560 --> 34:49.880]  to blow Benghazi wide open on this broadcast and I can't tell you what
[34:49.880 --> 34:54.680]  happened to him on the scenes the next day but it was a well he's still there
[34:54.680 --> 34:58.600]  and they're not right so these are real patriots folks and stand up for this
[34:58.600 --> 35:02.440]  country and get the information out to the American people and then Roger
[35:02.440 --> 35:06.920]  Stone's gonna be hosting the fourth hour always doing a great job as we prepare
[35:06.920 --> 35:10.000]  to expand the broadcasting around here with more hosts and more people and I
[35:10.000 --> 35:15.320]  got a lot of folks ready ready to take their training wheels off I want to go
[35:15.320 --> 35:21.200]  to Paul Watson for the balance the hour to cover a host of issues but just
[35:21.200 --> 35:27.360]  please understand this it takes funding to finance this operation this is the
[35:27.360 --> 35:33.400]  only type of operation of its kind in the world and yes it is the leading
[35:33.400 --> 35:38.680]  vanguard of exposing the globalist and getting intelligence out to the
[35:38.680 --> 35:42.440]  military the police and the intelligence agencies which I never even
[35:42.440 --> 35:46.600]  intended that as that's how this would work but they actually are in these
[35:46.600 --> 35:50.480]  areas and then they know how accurate the show is they've got info we've got
[35:50.480 --> 35:54.560]  info together we get a full picture of what the upper echelon is doing and we're
[35:54.560 --> 35:58.400]  gonna remove these traders if we're successful and we will be you start to
[35:58.400 --> 36:02.600]  see that happen but we need all of you to spread the articles and spread the
[36:02.600 --> 36:06.800]  videos because we've used Facebook we've used Twitter we've used Reddit we've
[36:06.800 --> 36:10.080]  used all these platforms but more and more we're being strangled and governed
[36:10.080 --> 36:15.400]  down I was talking to Mr. Shoyer last night who famously has launched one of
[36:15.400 --> 36:18.800]  the biggest organizations to stop endangered rhino hunting and things
[36:18.800 --> 36:25.440]  and Facebook's blocked him 90% of what he was reaching just a year ago because
[36:25.440 --> 36:29.480]  it's seen as a pro veterans group anything American anything wholesome is
[36:29.480 --> 36:33.480]  not allowed you're like well then leave Facebook well that's where you reach
[36:33.480 --> 36:36.720]  people and that's where the folks we need to reach are and they advertise
[36:36.720 --> 36:40.280]  they're this open commons but now they're strangling it out and there's a
[36:40.280 --> 36:43.920]  serious antitrust thing here of censorship of libertarians veterans
[36:43.920 --> 36:49.120]  conservatives Americana people that just want common sense we're the common
[36:49.120 --> 36:54.120]  sense coalition the common sense movement and so spread the links spread
[36:54.120 --> 36:57.400]  the articles for some reason the link was dead for a few days and they changed
[36:57.400 --> 37:01.360]  some servers around in full wars dot com for slash newsletter we email out every

[37:17.400 --> 37:19.680]  essential to get our articles and our videos and things that are being
[37:19.680 --> 37:24.320]  censored and now it's not one thing being since today it's like 20 things and
[37:24.320 --> 37:28.720]  it's the most credible stuff we do if I'm acting silly and making a joke all
[37:28.720 --> 37:33.640]  that can have 10 million viewers but if it's Paul going here's 30 news articles
[37:33.640 --> 37:36.320]  admitting that appliances are spying on you and here's the former head of the
[37:36.320 --> 37:41.680]  CIA saying it so she conways right they go oh that's fake your band and then
[37:41.680 --> 37:47.600]  Gizmodo comes out big publication it says good shut them down Facebook pulls

[40:06.120 --> 40:09.680]  borders battle to get rid of Obamacare battle to shut down the Islamic State
[40:09.680 --> 40:13.400]  that Obama turned loose to bring down Europe in the West battle to expose
[40:13.400 --> 40:18.280]  vaccines is deadly like Trump's doing battle to get small business loans going
[40:18.280 --> 40:21.600]  that the big banks have been blocking for nine years as we try to get out of
[40:21.600 --> 40:25.240]  the TPP just just devastating victory after victory and we're the tip of the
[40:25.240 --> 40:29.800]  spear Trump's personally thanked you the listeners of the show for getting him
[40:29.800 --> 40:33.960]  elected he told me he said without you without drudge without savage you know
[40:33.960 --> 40:37.400]  we wouldn't be here and he said some other stuff but I'm not gonna say it but
[40:37.400 --> 40:41.080]  it's like he had dinner with Savage last week in Mar-a-Lago told me exact same
[40:41.080 --> 40:46.680]  thing because it's true folks we're in okay we need more of us not less more I
[40:46.680 --> 40:50.400]  want to see talk shows way better than me I love Mark Dice sing the rise of Mark
[40:50.400 --> 40:54.240]  Dice I love seeing the rise of Paul Watson I want to win I want to beat
[40:54.240 --> 40:57.800]  these dirtbags now Paul I mean I've been we've been talking about the
[40:57.800 --> 41:02.000]  censorship and people need to take this very serious because it's accelerating
[41:02.000 --> 41:06.000]  and warp speed right now I'm seeing more censorship condensed the last month
[41:06.000 --> 41:09.320]  then we've seen the previous five six years you concur with that and let's
[41:09.320 --> 41:11.760]  talk about what's happening tell folks what's happening we can scroll through
[41:11.760 --> 41:15.200]  your articles and show the screenshots of what they're removing what they're
[41:15.200 --> 41:20.960]  taking down senator Rand Paul taken down CIA section chief saying they did
[41:20.960 --> 41:25.560]  target Trump taken down it's the really credible stuff that proves their liars
[41:25.560 --> 41:29.320]  that they're taking down just like Google got caught taking away the negative
[41:29.320 --> 41:32.920]  comments about Hillary and and her crimes and congressional reports and
[41:32.920 --> 41:38.720]  judicial watch this is open naked 1984 memory hole men ministry of truth Paul
[41:38.720 --> 41:42.840]  Watson from London well of course you remember Alex that there was a huge
[41:42.840 --> 41:47.440]  scandal I think it was last year where Facebook got caught gaming the algorithm
[41:47.440 --> 41:52.320]  for their trending list to keep out conservative opinions and topics that was
[41:52.320 --> 41:56.200]  a huge scandal this is going to be a similar scandal if they don't sort it
[41:56.200 --> 42:01.560]  out the update is since we complained about this over the past week or two all
[42:01.560 --> 42:06.280]  of those posts and up until yesterday it was virtually every single thing I
[42:06.280 --> 42:11.160]  posted it started to the point where it any link whatsoever not even info wars
[42:11.160 --> 42:17.280]  links was censored as spam the update is that they've unblocked all the links and
[42:17.280 --> 42:21.240]  now they're all visible again since we complained about this it could have been
[42:21.240 --> 42:26.680]  a mass flagging attempt where organized brigades of leftists on the internet
[42:26.680 --> 42:31.320]  get together and plan to flag these but let's be clear we already wrote articles
[42:31.320 --> 42:34.960]  about that five years ago Google and others admitted this is Facebook separate
[42:34.960 --> 42:38.880]  in meetings they're going to create super mods who are able to go out and do it
[42:38.880 --> 42:43.120]  who are just visitors to YouTube and then the elite can act like they're not
[42:43.120 --> 42:46.360]  the ones doing it it's the community so let's be clear this community's being
[42:46.360 --> 42:49.520]  created by Facebook but because it's blowing up in their face and we're
[42:49.520 --> 42:54.440]  complaining they're having to back off for now go ahead it's empowering mobs to
[42:54.440 --> 42:58.280]  go on witch hunts I mean YouTube tried to introduce it a few months back with
[42:58.280 --> 43:03.000]  their heroes program and you know if you flagged a certain number of videos you
[43:03.000 --> 43:06.680]  got up to the higher tiers the higher point levels because you're a good
[43:06.680 --> 43:11.000]  obedient citizen crushing free speech but I guess we shouldn't complain too much
[43:11.000 --> 43:16.120]  Alex because you know over in Germany it's even worse they hired x stars the
[43:16.120 --> 43:20.840]  officials to work with the government and it's now a 500 euro fine they want a
[43:20.840 --> 43:26.520]  53 million euro fine go ahead and this morning I heard about a story which is
[43:26.520 --> 43:32.760]  even worse somebody in Germany posted a story critical they were criticizing
[43:32.760 --> 43:38.280]  the Islamic practice which occurs in some countries of raping young boys because
[43:38.280 --> 43:42.720]  that's cultural enrichment Afghanistan for example there was a big scandal US
[43:42.720 --> 43:46.160]  military tried to blow the whistle on it they were told to shut up because they
[43:46.160 --> 43:50.000]  do like to rape young boys in some of these countries so this German guy
[43:50.000 --> 43:56.400]  posted criticism of that on Facebook now he's being charged with disseminating
[43:56.400 --> 44:02.440]  child porn for criticizing the practice of young boys being raped that's how bad
[44:02.440 --> 44:08.800]  it is in Germany you had a woman who posted a picture of a migrant in Germany
[44:08.800 --> 44:13.320]  who had raped and killed a 19-year-old woman her Facebook account was shut down
[44:13.320 --> 44:18.280]  because she circulated an image of the murderer which had already been widely
[44:18.280 --> 44:23.160]  circulated in German media let's be clear MSM is allowed to circulate photos and
[44:23.160 --> 44:26.960]  things it's the general public or independent news groups even if we're
[44:26.960 --> 44:31.720]  older and bigger than them in some cases we're not allowed like we can't show
[44:31.720 --> 44:35.760]  video of an Apache blowing up a tank even when it's on a hundred other
[44:35.760 --> 44:40.280]  channels YouTube would then ban us and say it was violent and we broke the
[44:40.280 --> 44:44.520]  rules until I started to follow lost it and they backed off this is the example
[44:44.520 --> 44:48.600]  of where they have rules for themselves and then different rules for us will they
[44:48.600 --> 44:53.120]  be successful Paul in killing our free speech and what should we do to stop it
[44:53.120 --> 44:58.320]  well we need to point out that this argument oh it's a private company they
[44:58.320 --> 45:02.280]  can do what they want complete BS it's funny isn't it how leftists only support
[45:02.280 --> 45:06.560]  that argument when it's targeting and censoring conservatives if a private
[45:06.560 --> 45:09.760]  company doesn't want to bake a cake for a gay wedding then they want the
[45:09.760 --> 45:14.120]  government to crack down on them but this is perfectly fine the other aspect
[45:14.120 --> 45:19.000]  is of course Le Pen in France is now they've removed the immunity for her to
[45:19.000 --> 45:23.680]  be charged now facing felony charges yeah for basically sharing a picture of
[45:23.680 --> 45:28.560]  an ISIS execution which again was widely circulated in the media you're
[45:28.560 --> 45:32.400]  allowed to show it on the news but the major member of the French government
[45:32.400 --> 45:36.100]  and EU parliament she's not allowed to and she's not the leader of the
[45:36.100 --> 45:40.120]  presidential race she's still not allowed to because the anointed ones in
[45:40.120 --> 45:45.560]  the mainstream media and the government said no exactly even though it had been
[45:45.560 --> 45:49.720]  widely shared circulated in the media for months and months before and of course
[45:49.720 --> 45:54.560]  today you've got this gizmodo article basically arguing that we shouldn't be
[45:54.560 --> 45:59.880]  censored for spam we should be censored for fake news this is a company owned by
[45:59.880 --> 46:05.640]  Univision this is a corporate media outlet why do they want us to be censored
[46:05.640 --> 46:09.560]  Alex well because we're kicking their butt because where the competition and
[46:09.560 --> 46:14.320]  we expose you know George Ramos and the rest of it it's insane and notice what
[46:14.320 --> 46:19.000]  they use as examples of BS news that we're saying appliances are surveilling
[46:19.000 --> 46:24.400]  you that that was admitted by the CIA director three years ago yeah but you
[46:24.400 --> 46:29.520]  know their writer Eve Pacer can get up on Twitter and say that things to do
[46:29.520 --> 46:34.880]  coolest crimes ranked number three assassinating the president that's Eve
[46:34.880 --> 46:40.560]  Pacer writes for gizmodo owned by Univision they can get up on social
[46:40.560 --> 46:44.920]  media and threaten the president but if we report on actual programs of
[46:44.920 --> 46:49.560]  surveillance but the CIA is doing that we've reported on for 11 plus years that's
[46:49.560 --> 46:53.280]  bad that's right let's be clear we're the people that originally broke it first
[46:53.280 --> 46:59.180]  you and I and our NSA sources exactly as we said the schematics the hubs secret
[46:59.180 --> 47:05.680]  documents with no problem surprise no no no no no no no we're banned specifically
[47:05.680 --> 47:13.480]  for exposing admitted programs in vault 7 and gizmodo celebrates it exactly and
[47:13.480 --> 47:17.840]  I think what's happening Alex is you know the left on social media has had it
[47:17.840 --> 47:22.960]  their own way for so long since the birth of Twitter since the birth of Facebook
[47:22.960 --> 47:27.240]  you look at Twitter now and there's a real war going on these leftists don't
[47:27.240 --> 47:30.960]  seem to realize or some of them are actually beginning to realize that you
[47:30.960 --> 47:36.000]  know virtue signaling to your echo chamber on Twitter and mingles smog and
[47:36.000 --> 47:39.880]  laughing at those right silly right-wingers on Twitter that's no longer

[48:17.640 --> 48:21.480]  keep people poor one to shut down any competition imagine the old Sumner
[48:21.480 --> 48:25.840]  Redstone's how pissed they are that Matt Drudge has more news views than
[48:25.840 --> 48:30.040]  Facebook and the New York Times and the Washington Post combined number two on
[48:30.040 --> 48:34.480]  the internet period and then imagine how pissed they are that we reach
[48:34.480 --> 48:39.520]  conservatively 45 million people a week imagine how angry they are that PewDiePie
[48:39.520 --> 48:45.320]  reaches 15 billion people on one channel alone derivatives I looked it up
[48:45.320 --> 48:50.160]  another 17 billion they just can't deal with us but nothing will ever stop it
[48:50.160 --> 48:54.520]  it's like whack-a-mole they could kill me kill you kill whatever literally kill
[48:54.520 --> 48:59.160]  us and and people don't want all corporate force-fed minority more it's
[48:59.160 --> 49:03.920]  over they've got a bunch of old people and low-income sad folks I'm sad for them
[49:03.920 --> 49:09.240]  the demographics are clear mainstream news is where the losers go Paul yeah
[49:09.240 --> 49:13.320]  and I mean PewDiePie made a whole video about how trust in mainstream media
[49:13.320 --> 49:17.880]  especially amongst young people is completely cratering you can look at
[49:17.880 --> 49:21.760]  the grass six percent of already yeah you better believe that they're
[49:21.760 --> 49:25.800]  absolutely terrified doesn't doesn't matter if he's left-wing white
[49:25.800 --> 49:29.800]  right-wing whatever the fact that he's independent that he's not controlled
[49:29.800 --> 49:34.680]  since they silenced all his sponsors and killed his TV show over making Nazi
[49:34.680 --> 49:39.120]  jokes I guess we better ban Charlie Chaplin and John Cleese as well the sheer
[49:39.120 --> 49:43.240]  terror that somebody being independent being able to think for themselves and
[49:43.240 --> 49:48.760]  having such a massive audience strikes fear into the heart they couldn't they
[49:48.760 --> 49:54.360]  can't stand they can't stand there have been articles about Sumner Redstone I
[49:54.360 --> 49:57.840]  know folks that know him and have known him up for decades where there'd be all
[49:57.840 --> 50:00.680]  these child stars where he was obsessed about having all the child stars under
[50:00.680 --> 50:03.920]  his control so you put political messages into him to control the youth and
[50:03.920 --> 50:07.880]  when somebody else would sign a child star he would just reportedly wreck
[50:07.880 --> 50:12.400]  things and break things and scream and overturn things and go insane that's
[50:12.400 --> 50:16.480]  over wanting to control kids music you imagine the Sumner Redstone's and
[50:16.480 --> 50:20.040]  people and you know Viacom that's financing this homeland show about me
[50:20.040 --> 50:23.960]  with all these lies you imagine how pissed they are dead oh yeah putty pies
[50:23.960 --> 50:27.880]  got you know 30 million young people today watching we have tens of millions
[50:27.880 --> 50:31.720]  of the military and intelligence agencies and the and the hardcore
[50:31.720 --> 50:36.120]  governments that's why info wars is so key because I have the people that
[50:36.120 --> 50:39.640]  actually run everything listening but not the evil on the top the people that
[50:39.640 --> 50:43.360]  actually run the show are now becoming decompartmentalized with info wars we're
[50:43.360 --> 50:46.600]  gonna come back at a final couple segments with Paul Watson and then speaking
[50:46.600 --> 50:49.640]  of the folks that have actually been on the front lines and on the inside of
[50:49.640 --> 50:53.560]  basically everything we don't want the top Navy SEALs in history joining us in

[51:16.560 --> 51:20.640]  problem for some of us there is the nagging thought that we may not always
[51:20.640 --> 51:25.760]  have it so good so we keep some food on hand just in case my family and I have
[51:25.760 --> 51:29.760]  found a product that helps us do this better it's a home freeze dryer from

[54:34.920 --> 54:40.280]  electronic gulags these electronic ghettos as he called him because that's
[54:40.280 --> 54:44.480]  how they control you and first go to Nazi Germany first people the Nazis were

[54:48.080 --> 54:51.400]  the nice area then they shut down the businesses in the poor and then they
[54:51.400 --> 54:54.520]  put them into ghettos and they round them up they start cutting off speech they
[54:54.520 --> 54:58.120]  start cutting us off Google let us advertise just milk toast stuff we're

[55:01.640 --> 55:04.880]  started after the New York Times came out a month ago and admitted that we are
[55:04.880 --> 55:08.160]  bigger than the New York Times and that's just a fact but drudge is way
[55:08.160 --> 55:13.520]  bigger than us so that's the thing we're bigger we're the new media and then
[55:13.520 --> 55:18.320]  they're the establishment media with the elite shutting us off that's
[55:18.320 --> 55:23.160]  sensationally corrupt and we shouldn't just accept it I shouldn't accept it the
[55:23.160 --> 55:25.880]  listeners shouldn't accept it Paul let me ask you this in this segment the next
[55:25.880 --> 55:29.000]  and I appreciate your time and our guests is coming in I get that you
[55:29.000 --> 55:33.320]  dominate Twitter more impressions of the BBC has total that was in the news

[55:38.040 --> 55:41.760]  need to get everybody from those platforms to info wars and I need you
[55:41.760 --> 55:46.200]  as I've been telling you for months is your smart guy remember I beg you to get

[55:56.200 --> 55:58.640]  hear from you daily because it's getting to the point where we have to
[55:58.640 --> 56:02.880]  interface directly with them like drudge does with drudgereport.com like we
[56:02.880 --> 56:07.120]  did with info wars but we have to just do it Paul we have to get folks in the
[56:07.120 --> 56:11.600]  exodus now to really just start coming to us because they're going to kick us
[56:11.600 --> 56:17.520]  off okay. No precisely and now even though this fake news narrative failed in
[56:17.520 --> 56:21.600]  the eyes of the American people if you look at the polls even Buzzfeed is now
[56:21.600 --> 56:25.320]  admitting that there's an audience on the left that seems willing to believe
[56:25.320 --> 56:28.680]  virtually any claim that could damage Trump and there are fake documents
[56:28.680 --> 56:33.200]  circulating about another made-up scandal but Harvard University nobody
[56:33.200 --> 56:36.640]  seems to have picked up on this much about five days ago came out with a
[56:36.640 --> 56:40.120]  huge list of fake and misleading news websites which is what they're gonna use
[56:40.120 --> 56:45.600]  to censor us on social media every single major conservative website is on
[56:45.600 --> 56:50.960]  that list so they're making blacklists they're trying to put that into place so
[56:50.960 --> 56:55.240]  Facebook can use that as a reference. Yeah they use that as a cover oh Harvard
[56:55.240 --> 56:58.480]  where Zuckerberg comes from and everybody it says banned info wars it
[56:58.480 --> 57:02.880]  says banned drudge. Yeah but they're working with the non-partial independent
[57:02.880 --> 57:09.440]  organization snow which isn't a completely biased far left outfit who
[57:09.440 --> 57:14.560]  actually made up quotes out of thin air when they tried to refute one of my
[57:14.560 --> 57:19.880]  videos about six months ago openly biased far left organization every single
[57:19.880 --> 57:24.920]  one they're working with for this fake news thought policing is biased is far
[57:24.920 --> 57:30.120]  left it's a blatant attempt to censor conservative libertarian. Let me raise
[57:30.120 --> 57:35.760]  this to you. Let me raise this. Where does it go? They're failing the
[57:35.760 --> 57:39.160]  public's rejecting them but they're the establishment they're moving forward
[57:39.160 --> 57:44.960]  they're the elite shutting us down so where does this go? They're gonna lose
[57:44.960 --> 57:48.760]  their power eventually most of them still live in an echo chamber Alex they
[57:48.760 --> 57:53.560]  think if they get a couple of hundred retweets making a smug joke about
[57:53.560 --> 57:58.120]  supermail vitality and guffawing with it about it amongst their friends on
[57:58.120 --> 58:02.200]  Twitter that that means they're winning. Meanwhile you know I'm getting 1.5
[58:02.200 --> 58:06.640]  million views on YouTube for a video about Trump's Muslim ban some of the
[58:06.640 --> 58:10.720]  ones that go on Facebook get 17 million and that's why they're shutting us down
[58:10.720 --> 58:15.240]  because where winning the argument they can't compete on a level playing field
[58:15.240 --> 58:20.400]  they always turn to censorship and they prove their the establishment is not
[58:20.400 --> 58:25.840]  popular and they prove their their the establishment by banning us and they've
[58:25.840 --> 58:29.040]  got and still they've got big parts of the government on their side let's come

[1:00:10.560 --> 1:00:16.120]  coming to you from the former United States of America from deep in the heart
[1:00:16.120 --> 1:00:20.760]  of Texas it's Alex Jones
[1:00:46.120 --> 1:00:57.920]  sorry working on developing news stories here Paul I've been running over you
[1:00:57.920 --> 1:01:00.240]  I appreciate you coming on we just got to get you to your own show every day for
[1:01:00.240 --> 1:01:04.720]  an hour that's the answer I feel it everybody wants you they need you Paul

[1:01:08.760 --> 1:01:12.840]  can't censor it as easily what else do we do where is this going it shows we're
[1:01:12.840 --> 1:01:16.920]  winning we really are with the Communist Chinese and the news saying will help
[1:01:16.920 --> 1:01:20.240]  the Liberals block America I mean this has become comical if it wasn't so
[1:01:20.240 --> 1:01:25.720]  serious well it's important to stress that we are winning we're winning the
[1:01:25.720 --> 1:01:29.120]  argument that's why they have to resort to this censorship if we were losing
[1:01:29.120 --> 1:01:33.960]  they wouldn't have to do this I think we win with comedy comedy completely
[1:01:33.960 --> 1:01:37.480]  disarms them you were talking about it earlier just laughing at the complete
[1:01:37.480 --> 1:01:42.000]  total embarrassment that this Rachel Manow thing was and by the way I've
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:46.480]  got a video coming up about that in a couple of hours so you use comedy you
[1:01:46.480 --> 1:01:50.840]  use what they call in the mean world weaponized autism which is basically
[1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:55.080]  just being completely obsessed because if you look at mainstream journalists
[1:01:55.080 --> 1:02:00.160]  Alex you know they sit back in their smog ivory towers they write one article
[1:02:00.160 --> 1:02:03.880]  a week and they think that they're super important and that they're having a
[1:02:03.880 --> 1:02:07.120]  massive impact they're not having a massive impact they've been completely
[1:02:07.120 --> 1:02:13.000]  overwhelmed why do you think BBC and New York Times keep putting out ads begging
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:19.920]  to hire people who can write quite quote quick articles to respond quickly to
[1:02:19.920 --> 1:02:23.440]  developing news events because they don't know they don't have anyone who can do
[1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:27.760]  that he's made they have the losers they have the control freaks they're really
[1:02:27.760 --> 1:02:32.520]  lazy Alex they've got no skill none of them can edit videos most of them can't
[1:02:32.520 --> 1:02:37.440]  even talk into a camera they write one article a week sit back virtue signal
[1:02:37.440 --> 1:02:40.600]  on Twitter and think that that's gonna win them the debate that that's gonna
[1:02:40.600 --> 1:02:44.080]  win the culture war it's not they're getting their box kicked and now they're
[1:02:44.080 --> 1:02:49.280]  finally starting to panic about it so they are the very definition of posers
[1:02:49.280 --> 1:02:54.160]  of fakes of Fox and they're trying to destroy the real thing the vitality
[1:02:54.160 --> 1:02:58.080]  that's why the left tries to destroy success and vitality because they're
[1:02:58.080 --> 1:03:04.160]  losers and they hate success yeah that I mean you look at Daily Beast they're
[1:03:04.160 --> 1:03:08.920]  like they're big major writers on Daily Beast dot com they write one article a

[1:03:17.640 --> 1:03:20.920]  wrote a whole article about it and that's what they'll do for an entire week
[1:03:20.920 --> 1:03:24.400]  they can't edit videos they don't know about memes they don't know about
[1:03:24.400 --> 1:03:27.960]  anything you know I could put out one meme on your Facebook page and it would
[1:03:27.960 --> 1:03:32.920]  reach more people than their entire output in a week or two weeks that's how
[1:03:32.920 --> 1:03:39.360]  pathetic yes yes Paul ladies please please do a show every day please Paul

[1:04:59.040 --> 1:05:03.760]  well it looks like even the establishment mainstream media has to admit
[1:05:03.760 --> 1:05:09.760]  that Rachel Maddow's Trump tax scandal is a big nothing burger if all we get
[1:05:09.760 --> 1:05:14.760]  tonight is that Donald Trump paid $38 million to America's government that's
[1:05:14.760 --> 1:05:19.720]  a good night for Donald there's just really no way like I was hoping and
[1:05:19.720 --> 1:05:23.520]  praying that it would show not only do you pay no taxes he actually charged the
[1:05:23.520 --> 1:05:27.640]  government and got money back sorry to disappoint you Van Jones but what you
[1:05:27.640 --> 1:05:32.240]  liberals thought was going to be a huge Trump scandal ended up being a big
[1:05:32.240 --> 1:05:36.560]  boost to President Donald Trump's reputation as a successful hard-working
[1:05:36.560 --> 1:05:41.400]  American and tax-paying businessman and now we know that Trump actually paid a
[1:05:41.400 --> 1:05:47.000]  high tax rate of roughly 25% compare that to MSNBC's parent company Comcast
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:53.760]  which paid 24% Barack Obama 19% and Bernie Sanders who only paid 18% in

[1:08:14.320 --> 1:08:27.880]  give me liberty or give me death it's Alex Jones well somebody got Trump's
[1:08:27.880 --> 1:08:30.720]  tax returns and it turns out he paid a higher percentage than all the
[1:08:30.720 --> 1:08:36.000]  Democrats combined turns out he's not dodging his taxes blow up in their
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:40.080]  face that's up on drudgerport.com info wars.com you name it so is our
[1:08:40.080 --> 1:08:43.800]  interview with Michael Savage that's up there Trump's war is battle for America
[1:08:43.800 --> 1:08:49.080]  and his battle is our battle Trump's got an A plus rating for me about a 95 right
[1:08:49.080 --> 1:08:52.600]  now I don't like him going along with this Paul Ryan health plan but
[1:08:52.600 --> 1:08:56.040]  Obamacare is meant to destroy the economy so they don't repeal that it's
[1:08:56.040 --> 1:08:59.320]  gonna really hurt the economy he has that big goal of prosperity that anything
[1:08:59.320 --> 1:09:03.600]  can be done down the road but other than that Trump has just done things like
[1:09:03.600 --> 1:09:08.880]  killing the TPP getting the best small business numbers in and just 50 days it's
[1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:14.080]  55 days now but last week 50 days since 1984 at the height of the Reagan
[1:09:14.080 --> 1:09:18.600]  recovery and this is a crazy time to be alive redeclering our sovereignty it's
[1:09:18.600 --> 1:09:23.960]  it's it's it's simply amazing but they're turning the heat up Davos a month ago
[1:09:23.960 --> 1:09:26.160]  the Communist Chinese came and they were in the news it said
[1:09:26.160 --> 1:09:30.680]  communist China to help bolster globalism and stop Trump and there were our
[1:09:30.680 --> 1:09:35.200]  leaders corporate and governmental going yeah kind of Chinese dictators help us
[1:09:35.200 --> 1:09:40.640]  defeat America I mean it was just the I mean in the old days they'd all be
[1:09:40.640 --> 1:09:46.360]  arrested when they got home but they're the ones that claim Trump's this big
[1:09:46.360 --> 1:09:50.680]  Russian agent obviously with no proof they claim they have these wiretaps and
[1:09:50.680 --> 1:09:53.560]  then they said oh we never had wiretaps because there was no proof but they did
[1:09:53.560 --> 1:09:57.400]  wiretap now they're trying to lie about that so there's so much to talk about
[1:09:57.400 --> 1:10:02.880]  but I have just been simply trying to get the American people to understand a
[1:10:02.880 --> 1:10:06.440]  lot of you do understand better than I that there's a political war going on
[1:10:06.440 --> 1:10:10.160]  and this is one of the most important times in history we're now in and so I
[1:10:10.160 --> 1:10:14.400]  had the idea like last week with talking to Q and a few other friends I
[1:10:14.400 --> 1:10:17.800]  said you know the veterans were so awake during Obama and we're speaking out
[1:10:17.800 --> 1:10:22.040]  now they're still awake but they're you know just kind of looking to Trump to do
[1:10:22.040 --> 1:10:25.800]  it Trump can't come and call for help he has to look strong and he is strong but
[1:10:25.800 --> 1:10:30.680]  he's totally surrounded and every day different rappers different rock stars
[1:10:30.680 --> 1:10:34.120]  different movie stars call for his death newspapers call for his death Newsweek
[1:10:34.120 --> 1:10:37.720]  calls for rioting they have edited tapes the Michael Brown case to cause more
[1:10:37.720 --> 1:10:42.560]  rioting I mean this country really is in a fight for its life and so even if
[1:10:42.560 --> 1:10:47.440]  we're winning a little bit better take this fight serious it's not like you
[1:10:47.440 --> 1:10:50.240]  win the Super Bowl you start training to win the next one we haven't won the
[1:10:50.240 --> 1:10:54.080]  Super Bowl yet folks we're just finally turning the tide in the game maybe three
[1:10:54.080 --> 1:10:57.480]  points ahead that's my view so the rest of the hour we're joined by Craig Sawyer
[1:10:57.480 --> 1:11:00.960]  who's a really interesting guy obviously can't tell you about most of his
[1:11:00.960 --> 1:11:03.880]  history because it's all classified can't tell you what SEAL teams he was in
[1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:07.880]  even though everybody knows and all the things he's done and he's one of the
[1:11:07.880 --> 1:11:13.800]  main hosts obviously on top shows on Discovery Channel and you name it and
[1:11:13.800 --> 1:11:17.360]  he's got a whole bunch of great websites and a lot of things he's you know
[1:11:17.360 --> 1:11:20.680]  obviously up to and into but I don't want to say anything wrong you don't like
[1:11:20.680 --> 1:11:23.640]  talking about yourself but maybe I should just get you to give people your
[1:11:23.640 --> 1:11:26.920]  basic bio who don't know who you are but you're kind of the Navy SEAL Navy SEAL
[1:11:26.920 --> 1:11:32.080]  one of the most famous living Navy SEALs out there and you're here despite a lot
[1:11:32.080 --> 1:11:35.280]  of stuff going on your life I appreciate it just to give your view on the state
[1:11:35.280 --> 1:11:38.080]  of the world and where we're at and so much of what we're talking about you know
[1:11:38.080 --> 1:11:42.080]  it's pretty much dialed in so thanks for coming yeah no thanks for having me on
[1:11:42.080 --> 1:11:46.720]  Alex it's a pleasure well my background to start off in in the Marine Corps and
[1:11:46.720 --> 1:11:49.480]  then went into the Navy SEAL teams and then did five years of federal law
[1:11:49.480 --> 1:11:54.080]  enforcement and and then some high-threat contracting overseas protecting
[1:11:54.080 --> 1:11:57.120]  some of our government officials over there and then got into a counter poaching
[1:11:57.120 --> 1:12:01.040]  and now film and television work so kind of got a wide scope of professional
[1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:08.120]  experience and I just am not inclined to to sit back and allow our country to
[1:12:08.120 --> 1:12:14.400]  fall into the hands of the of the noisy rep reprobates and and depraved
[1:12:14.400 --> 1:12:18.480]  subversives that are that are screaming at our president right now we've
[1:12:18.480 --> 1:12:23.520]  elected a president he's representing our wishes we elected him to carry out
[1:12:23.520 --> 1:12:30.240]  the the the agenda that he ran on and he is doing that and I refuse to sit back
[1:12:30.240 --> 1:12:35.920]  and watch him be besieged from all sides by those who are lesser than who have
[1:12:35.920 --> 1:12:41.360]  lesser effective views of what works and I think right now as a veteran I'm
[1:12:41.360 --> 1:12:47.600]  whatever the consequences I I will not do anything but rally around my president
[1:12:47.600 --> 1:12:53.400]  and defend his back and I think we can all do that by having a much closer look
[1:12:53.400 --> 1:12:57.800]  and turning up the scrutiny upon those who are attacking them and him why are
[1:12:57.800 --> 1:13:01.360]  they attacking him what is it that that he's he's doing that's got them so
[1:13:01.360 --> 1:13:05.440]  upset he is increasing our national security he's working to reduce our
[1:13:05.440 --> 1:13:10.720]  tax burden to increase the effectiveness of our economy he's doing positive
[1:13:10.720 --> 1:13:16.360]  things and so I look at it and I say look if you watch what's going on and you
[1:13:16.360 --> 1:13:21.480]  see the results what the radical left are telling us doesn't match up with the
[1:13:21.480 --> 1:13:25.800]  facts what doesn't match up with the results the actions we're we've been
[1:13:25.800 --> 1:13:30.360]  lulled into freaking out over words Alex as a society oh he said this or
[1:13:30.360 --> 1:13:34.480]  somebody's claimed that about him well what are the actual facts on the ground
[1:13:34.480 --> 1:13:37.840]  what is actually taking place what's the direction he's actually taking us and
[1:13:37.840 --> 1:13:43.120]  if that is not adding up that that I don't want results yeah well actions
[1:13:43.120 --> 1:13:47.560]  speak louder than words they always have they always will we have to reset
[1:13:47.560 --> 1:13:53.520]  ourselves as a society and get back to looking at at actions rather than just
[1:13:53.520 --> 1:13:56.960]  the words I hear what you're saying but I'm more importantly I'm gonna watch
[1:13:56.960 --> 1:14:00.640]  what you're doing and we need to reset for that and that's crazy is I thought
[1:14:00.640 --> 1:14:04.200]  Trump was for real and knew he was but now he's like cutting the elites off
[1:14:04.200 --> 1:14:08.360]  killing TPP not letting these ultra rich groups shell out Americans he's but
[1:14:08.360 --> 1:14:11.480]  he's also letting them make money as long as they do it fair and under his
[1:14:11.480 --> 1:14:14.840]  system Goldman Sachs that gave 100% of their money to Hillary and tried to
[1:14:14.840 --> 1:14:19.080]  block him their stocks up 30 something percent they've made over 200 billion
[1:14:19.080 --> 1:14:22.560]  dollars and they're actually going Jamie Diamond went maybe we should get
[1:14:22.560 --> 1:14:27.400]  behind Trump this is crazy absolutely let everybody have wealth and the elites
[1:14:27.400 --> 1:14:30.600]  just get richer but these elites they just want to control everything they
[1:14:30.600 --> 1:14:33.680]  write white papers admitting it they want us to be poor while they're rich
[1:14:33.680 --> 1:14:38.760]  that's not gonna fly well if you listen to globalists like George Soros and
[1:14:38.760 --> 1:14:44.280]  what he says that he is about and what he wants and the kinds of subversive
[1:14:44.280 --> 1:14:50.240]  actions that he funds with his millions and even billions in some cases then
[1:14:50.240 --> 1:14:53.400]  we've we've got to take it to heart we've got to take the man at his word
[1:14:53.400 --> 1:14:57.320]  what he's about is breaking down the effectiveness of the United States of
[1:14:57.320 --> 1:15:00.480]  America he tried to plunge the British pound and he's brought down more than
[1:15:00.480 --> 1:15:03.960]  15 countries he admits he tries to bring countries down he's brought
[1:15:03.960 --> 1:15:08.440]  countries down that never recovered I mean he's totally evil so I've listened
[1:15:08.440 --> 1:15:11.800]  to his interviews and I've listened to what he says and I and I take it to
[1:15:11.800 --> 1:15:15.680]  heart so I'm like okay why is anyone supporting this man why is anyone
[1:15:15.680 --> 1:15:20.920]  taking money from him and why are we as a nation not paying attention getting
[1:15:20.920 --> 1:15:24.720]  giving greater scrutiny those people go wait a minute you're a subversive that's
[1:15:24.720 --> 1:15:28.800]  taking money to carry out an agenda of someone who's made himself our our
[1:15:28.800 --> 1:15:32.040]  enemy he's against our Constitution he's against everything the United States
[1:15:32.040 --> 1:15:35.800]  seems to stand for so I think we need to have a lot closer look at that and turn
[1:15:35.800 --> 1:15:40.840]  the tables I agree with you just looking at how fantastical reality is
[1:15:40.840 --> 1:15:44.720]  versus fiction they've always said true stranger than fiction to look at this
[1:15:44.720 --> 1:15:49.280]  epic battle how good Trump is and how good his people on average are really
[1:15:49.280 --> 1:15:52.800]  trying to be faithful and execute their job and the prosperity like a flight
[1:15:52.800 --> 1:15:56.800]  switch just floods back in what made America great works so good he didn't
[1:15:56.800 --> 1:16:00.480]  invent this he's bringing back an operating system that works is successful
[1:16:00.480 --> 1:16:04.520]  and then to watch all this scum you go out of these demonstrations against
[1:16:04.520 --> 1:16:07.360]  Trump I mean you can't find anybody that looks normal acts normal they're like
[1:16:07.360 --> 1:16:11.240]  mental patients and I don't say that with pleasure I'm freaked out by the way
[1:16:11.240 --> 1:16:15.160]  these people act and and what's wrong with them I and but you had a lot of
[1:16:15.160 --> 1:16:18.360]  insight yesterday we were privately talking about this mindset about like I
[1:16:18.360 --> 1:16:22.240]  guess misery loves company or what's going on well you know from from growing
[1:16:22.240 --> 1:16:27.280]  up my father was a devout pastor of a church and he had a lot of people come
[1:16:27.280 --> 1:16:33.120]  to to seek help and counseling from him and so just as a kid playing nearby in
[1:16:33.120 --> 1:16:36.680]  the room I could hear all these so I've heard hundreds of these conversations
[1:16:36.680 --> 1:16:39.880]  with people of all walks of life's with all different kinds of problems some of
[1:16:39.880 --> 1:16:43.880]  them with shattered lives and and just horrible stories and and so many of them
[1:16:43.880 --> 1:16:47.200]  that are really twisted and bitter against that which is effective and
[1:16:47.200 --> 1:16:51.560]  wholesome those are the hate the family unit they hate the institution of a
[1:16:51.560 --> 1:16:55.760]  loving mother and father that can raise wholesome well-grounded children I've
[1:16:55.760 --> 1:17:00.840]  heard that they are they're all seeming like have been abused children of
[1:17:00.840 --> 1:17:04.000]  horrible things that I wouldn't wish on anybody and it's heartbreaking for me to
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:10.320]  see the results of the perversion and abuse of innocent little children and
[1:17:10.320 --> 1:17:13.400]  it just shatters their psyche and it causes them to just turn against
[1:17:13.400 --> 1:17:17.480]  everything that's effective and and meaningful and that's where I see a lot
[1:17:17.480 --> 1:17:22.360]  of these depraved subversives are at mentally they just want to attack
[1:17:22.360 --> 1:17:26.240]  whatever is and whatever works and because they're just angry at the world
[1:17:26.240 --> 1:17:29.800]  because what happened to them and that's that's horrible I wish I could I could
[1:17:29.800 --> 1:17:34.840]  prevent that from happening to them but we can't allow them to to to set the
[1:17:34.840 --> 1:17:38.200]  agenda for which direction the United States goes because in their in their
[1:17:38.200 --> 1:17:41.920]  minds they're sick we talked about this just like an hour for over lunch I
[1:17:41.920 --> 1:17:45.760]  really want to reach out to them like the prodigal son not that I'm perfect in
[1:17:45.760 --> 1:17:49.600]  my life but I want them to have success too I know they're wrong and you just
[1:17:49.600 --> 1:17:54.320]  see them in the squalor of failure like celebrating being losers and trying them
[1:17:54.320 --> 1:17:57.240]  to make us be losers with them it's going to crab pot you know you catch a
[1:17:57.240 --> 1:18:00.080]  bunch of crabs putting a deal they don't attack other crabs they try to get
[1:18:00.080 --> 1:18:03.240]  out for some reason I don't want the other crab to get out as soon as a crab
[1:18:03.240 --> 1:18:06.560]  class to climb out they go after them and I just is there any way to get
[1:18:06.560 --> 1:18:10.160]  through to these people man I don't know I just try to share the factual
[1:18:10.160 --> 1:18:13.280]  information with with everybody that I can and say hey look here's what's
[1:18:13.280 --> 1:18:17.160]  actually happening how do you feel about that rather than just regurgitating
[1:18:17.160 --> 1:18:22.120]  what someone from a radical left news outlet is telling you you're
[1:18:22.120 --> 1:18:27.960]  you're regurgitating propaganda rather than looking at the facts on your own so
[1:18:27.960 --> 1:18:32.160]  it's unfortunate people don't really know where they're getting their talking
[1:18:32.160 --> 1:18:35.240]  points and their agenda from they just they tell you something I'm like man I
[1:18:35.240 --> 1:18:38.920]  can tell you which station you heard that from because I watch them all just to
[1:18:38.920 --> 1:18:43.320]  compare the flavor of the BS yeah yeah so when I when I question them on the
[1:18:43.320 --> 1:18:46.880]  facts they can't answer the facts so they they only can just regurgitate the
[1:18:46.880 --> 1:18:50.480]  talking points that they've been fed and that's unfortunate I want American
[1:18:50.480 --> 1:18:53.840]  citizens to be empowered the same reason we want our children empowered with
[1:18:53.840 --> 1:18:57.320]  knowledge knowledge's power I would love to see all Americans really
[1:18:57.320 --> 1:19:01.960]  understanding what's happening rather than being led through a series of
[1:19:01.960 --> 1:19:06.560]  propaganda into a lesser existence and giving up their freedoms and liberty
[1:19:06.560 --> 1:19:11.200]  liberties for the promise the false promise of free stuff because it doesn't
[1:19:11.200 --> 1:19:15.640]  work out that way I've seen victims of socialism and communism across the globe
[1:19:15.640 --> 1:19:20.080]  of traveled to 55 countries and multiple different capacities and I've seen the
[1:19:20.080 --> 1:19:24.120]  devastation well that's the classic thing these trendies with their iPhones
[1:19:24.120 --> 1:19:27.000]  and their cars you know even the poorest of the trainees is living better than
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:30.120]  poor people other nations and then they just hate America but most have never
[1:19:30.120 --> 1:19:33.800]  been outside the country it's that classic deal if they had we're gonna skip
[1:19:33.800 --> 1:19:36.840]  this break sorry I've got to tell you guys if they had then they wouldn't be
[1:19:36.840 --> 1:19:40.480]  shooting their mouth off like that it's just asinine well it or the it's the
[1:19:40.480 --> 1:19:44.400]  people Alex that have traveled the most and have seen the most and how many
[1:19:44.400 --> 1:19:48.800]  countries you've been I've been 55 for me so far and some of those I've been to
[1:19:48.800 --> 1:19:53.960]  numerous times and spent years going back and forth and working for several
[1:19:53.960 --> 1:19:58.400]  different government agencies so I've I've met all kinds of folks and seen all
[1:19:58.400 --> 1:20:02.440]  kinds of different situations I've been everywhere man well not everywhere but
[1:20:02.440 --> 1:20:06.840]  I've learned enough to know that the more places of Johnny Cash that the
[1:20:06.840 --> 1:20:12.320]  false the false promise that the the the attraction of big government that's
[1:20:12.320 --> 1:20:15.920]  gonna become your mommy and take care of everything really has turned
[1:20:15.920 --> 1:20:21.040]  horrifically nightmarish everywhere over the decades when that big socialist or
[1:20:21.040 --> 1:20:24.560]  communist model turns against its people we're looking at I mean look at
[1:20:24.560 --> 1:20:28.040]  Venezuela right now millions are trying to get out two years ago they'd eaten
[1:20:28.040 --> 1:20:32.320]  all the zoo animals now they've eaten all the pets the cats the dogs I mean it
[1:20:32.320 --> 1:20:36.720]  is just total collapse right now it is and you can look at that of the globe
[1:20:36.720 --> 1:20:41.000]  over you can the world over you can look at numerous cases where it's even
[1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  turned into genocide we've got hundreds of millions of innocent families
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:48.840]  systematically lined up and murdered by their governments when their big
[1:20:48.840 --> 1:20:52.520]  government whom they've given all their freedom and liberty to eventually turn
[1:20:52.520 --> 1:20:57.360]  to take common is China into World War two Mao Zedong gets in power in all of
[1:20:57.360 --> 1:21:00.280]  World War two maybe 10 million Chinese died it was a big war with the Japanese
[1:21:00.280 --> 1:21:05.080]  he then over the next 20 years kills 84 billion the Chinese admit this it was on
[1:21:05.080 --> 1:21:08.600]  people making farmers going to collective things is everybody stars
[1:21:08.600 --> 1:21:12.920]  death they weren't resisting it was oh don't be anti-Asian I'm anti a guy that
[1:21:12.920 --> 1:21:16.520]  killed 84 million people right again there's this disconnect and then
[1:21:16.520 --> 1:21:22.680]  trendies think Mao's cool well have Mao tattoos while they drive Mercedes they've
[1:21:22.680 --> 1:21:26.480]  been indoctrinated to regurgitate that they've been taught that in our in our
[1:21:26.480 --> 1:21:31.760]  educational institutions they've been our educational system our entertainment
[1:21:31.760 --> 1:21:35.080]  industry and our so-called new news industries have all been weaponized
[1:21:35.080 --> 1:21:40.200]  against the United States with this this anti-American rhetoric and it's a
[1:21:40.200 --> 1:21:46.080]  horrific impact in its totality and we better wake up to it to a greater
[1:21:46.080 --> 1:21:51.200]  degree and rally around the one man who's who's dared to insert himself into
[1:21:51.200 --> 1:21:56.320]  the cesspool which is Washington DC and carry the American flag of freedom and
[1:21:56.320 --> 1:22:00.640]  liberty for all of us so I think those that have been demonizing him so far
[1:22:00.640 --> 1:22:04.160]  listening to you know Trump eats puppies or whatever kind of falsehoods are
[1:22:04.160 --> 1:22:10.320]  being pumped out there I have the the unique benefit of knowing having mutual
[1:22:10.320 --> 1:22:14.720]  friends with the Trump family and I know that he treats minorities and females
[1:22:14.720 --> 1:22:21.200]  better than his detractors than then his accusers actually do and so at some
[1:22:21.200 --> 1:22:25.560]  point I think we've got to start looking at the hypocrisy and and the double
[1:22:25.560 --> 1:22:32.280]  standard and the disingenuous claims of his attackers and start looking at them
[1:22:32.280 --> 1:22:36.280]  and visiting greater scrutiny upon them because many of them are actual felons
[1:22:36.280 --> 1:22:40.520]  they belong in prison nothing's been done about it yet so I think we can't
[1:22:40.520 --> 1:22:45.680]  allow them I say the worst thing you can ever do in any sort of conflict is
[1:22:45.680 --> 1:22:51.320]  allow your opponents to attack you at their leisure we have to go after them
[1:22:51.320 --> 1:22:55.360]  because again many of them are actual criminals they belong behind bars and
[1:22:55.360 --> 1:22:58.360]  have a look at them if they're attacking Trump they need to be looking over
[1:22:58.360 --> 1:23:01.240]  their shoulder wonder whether or not they're gonna end up exactly they want
[1:23:01.240 --> 1:23:05.280]  to bully us criminally and run around and say murder kill do all this stuff and
[1:23:05.280 --> 1:23:09.720]  have sorrows for hundreds of millions for the sorrows leaders showing up and
[1:23:09.720 --> 1:23:13.000]  literally saying things like you know it's time to kill more cops everybody
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:16.480]  chance that that's organizing to go out and murder people if I got out in the
[1:23:16.480 --> 1:23:19.360]  street and said let's go kill black people or white people I should be
[1:23:19.360 --> 1:23:23.600]  arrested that's not free speech that's organizing a criminal conspiracy that
[1:23:23.600 --> 1:23:27.200]  I mean that's basically worse than murder one permitted murder it's the
[1:23:27.200 --> 1:23:31.960]  conspiracy to commit murder go try that level of subversion in any other
[1:23:31.960 --> 1:23:35.760]  country and see how that works out for you to be behind bars in a matter of
[1:23:35.760 --> 1:23:40.720]  minutes and I think we need to return in the United States to a lawful peaceful
[1:23:40.720 --> 1:23:44.520]  society we've had a lot of disruption over the last eight years and longer
[1:23:44.520 --> 1:23:51.840]  even and it needs to come to a stop we need to reset on the peaceful freedom and
[1:23:51.840 --> 1:23:56.440]  liberty existence that our founding fathers had set forth for us which we
[1:23:56.440 --> 1:23:59.400]  know is a system work rather than any other I'm just sick of hearing how bad
[1:23:59.400 --> 1:24:03.400]  we are as they try to change our system then it wrecks it and then everybody's
[1:24:03.400 --> 1:24:07.080]  trying to get in to get here and then bitch about it right Craig Sawyer is our
[1:24:07.080 --> 1:24:10.760]  guest I can't go over his whole bio when it was latest shows his battleground
[1:24:10.760 --> 1:24:15.520]  rhino wars we'll talk about that and top shot obviously all five seasons of
[1:24:15.520 --> 1:24:19.720]  that and all the work he's done in different seal team ribs that we can't
[1:24:19.720 --> 1:24:26.040]  even get into her mention here and the things he's done but expanding on this
[1:24:26.040 --> 1:24:30.040]  obviously can we tell the story about how you found out about the show yeah
[1:24:30.040 --> 1:24:36.760]  years ago yeah well I was overseas and a friend of mine who is a particularly
[1:24:36.760 --> 1:24:42.000]  experienced person in the intelligence community shared an note with me and he
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:45.480]  and it and he said you know Craig you need to research some of this of what's
[1:24:45.480 --> 1:24:49.120]  going on big picture stuff I've been all over the world have been through several
[1:24:49.120 --> 1:24:52.440]  different campaigns and on boots on the ground understand what really happens and
[1:24:52.440 --> 1:24:56.400]  have met all these different people at all levels and you need to make yourself
[1:24:56.400 --> 1:25:00.640]  aware of what's happening and the website that he told me to research first
[1:25:00.640 --> 1:25:06.840]  was in fact your own and and it was I stayed up all night watching dozens and
[1:25:06.840 --> 1:25:11.640]  dozens of videos getting highly upset and after that deployment went home tried
[1:25:11.640 --> 1:25:17.480]  to tell my own family and my mother and father got it because I grew up as a
[1:25:17.480 --> 1:25:22.520]  child having people visit our home they were intellectuals from all over all
[1:25:22.520 --> 1:25:26.160]  walks of life my father was a pastor they came there to visit him about that
[1:25:26.160 --> 1:25:29.240]  some of your dad was pretty famous pastor in Texas and some of the groups he
[1:25:29.240 --> 1:25:35.600]  helped start and I don't know about famous but he was a very good
[1:25:35.600 --> 1:25:41.000]  friends with John Osteen and just just a man that I hold at the very highest
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:45.640]  level of moral integrity so they got they got it I was hearing that you know
[1:25:45.640 --> 1:25:51.440]  intelligence agents and diplomats and Christian missionaries who were
[1:25:51.440 --> 1:25:55.720]  smuggling Bibles behind the iron curtain back in the day talk about what was
[1:25:55.720 --> 1:25:59.160]  happening the struggle for power and the globalization the new world
[1:25:59.160 --> 1:26:04.800]  Christians they were reported yep I refer to it as and and how the the
[1:26:04.800 --> 1:26:08.440]  prosecution or the persecution of Christian go back to you heard as a
[1:26:08.440 --> 1:26:11.520]  child and they come up because I was interrupted you kind of repeating as you
[1:26:11.520 --> 1:26:14.320]  told me yesterday the very same stuff but new world order targeting Christians
[1:26:14.320 --> 1:26:17.960]  is coming yep they're like hey there's there's gonna come a day when as a
[1:26:17.960 --> 1:26:21.720]  Christian you are gonna have to make a decision ultimately delivered I because
[1:26:21.720 --> 1:26:26.160]  the the persecution against Christians is gonna get that extreme at some point
[1:26:26.160 --> 1:26:30.160]  and we see it happening now more and more now they're taking the flag out of
[1:26:30.160 --> 1:26:33.920]  you know places they're taking the Bible out of places you know you can't
[1:26:33.920 --> 1:26:39.320]  pray in schools and it's just it's just a creeping oh yeah in fact this week
[1:26:39.320 --> 1:26:42.840]  basketball games you know the Muslims say they don't want to see an American
[1:26:42.840 --> 1:26:45.800]  flag so that's not allowed three articles a day another school banned
[1:26:45.800 --> 1:26:50.280]  students from bringing American flag to football game that's the Egan news we
[1:26:50.280 --> 1:26:54.560]  got a Facebook suspense user over American flag image anti-trump night
[1:26:54.560 --> 1:27:00.760]  circuit upheld US flag band in schools despite First Amendment I mean we can't
[1:27:00.760 --> 1:27:05.680]  even have the flag now because of the globalist this is ridiculous how do we
[1:27:05.680 --> 1:27:10.760]  get to this point we creeping we got into it the way the same way you boil a
[1:27:10.760 --> 1:27:15.280]  frog a little bit at a time and that's been the strategy to do that so we must
[1:27:15.280 --> 1:27:19.400]  not stand for it at any point it's not a matter of of being intolerant and letting
[1:27:19.400 --> 1:27:24.160]  other people have their way it's a matter of protecting what we have learned to be
[1:27:24.160 --> 1:27:27.920]  wholesome and good and effective and that is what our country's culture is
[1:27:27.920 --> 1:27:32.880]  based upon and our country's culture is what's under attack being wholesome
[1:27:32.880 --> 1:27:37.880]  being successful being honorable being strong being true all of that's under
[1:27:37.880 --> 1:27:42.280]  attack because you can't have an elite running a society like that an
[1:27:42.280 --> 1:27:48.320]  uninformed public who are disempowered who cannot raise the the financial capital
[1:27:48.320 --> 1:27:55.640]  to to stand up against tyranny is is desirable for a for a tyrant sitting ducks
[1:27:55.640 --> 1:27:59.840]  they want us to be sitting ducks and we must not allow it and and that's why they
[1:27:59.840 --> 1:28:05.400]  hate Donald Trump so much because Alex he has he gets it man he sees the
[1:28:05.400 --> 1:28:09.720]  struggle and he's looking to re-empower the American citizen as our
[1:28:09.720 --> 1:28:12.840]  founding fathers wanted absolutely you know I was asking everybody to give me
[1:28:12.840 --> 1:28:15.160]  some write-ups to plug some of the great things you're involved in a god don't
[1:28:15.160 --> 1:28:18.040]  worry about it but let's talk about your amazing website let's talk about some
[1:28:18.040 --> 1:28:19.960]  of the things you're involved in before we go to break we're gonna come back again
[1:28:19.960 --> 1:28:23.560]  into how we fight back where you see this going we've launched a new email I'm
[1:28:23.560 --> 1:28:26.640]  gonna give you for vets that want to post images say you support Trump or
[1:28:26.640 --> 1:28:30.200]  videos or whatever events you want to have whatever we want to magnify that give
[1:28:30.200 --> 1:28:33.680]  support that we'll talk about it after breaking with that email but it's Trump
[1:28:33.680 --> 1:28:38.120]  support at info wars calm just like five years ago Colonel Shaffer came out
[1:28:38.120 --> 1:28:42.360]  others did he went and told Congress hey we're funding al-qaeda al-Nazra
[1:28:42.360 --> 1:28:45.600]  Obama's behind it they went that he's behind the Muslim Brotherhood all the
[1:28:45.600 --> 1:28:49.600]  documents came out later Benghazi was a weapons transfer on purpose ordering
[1:28:49.600 --> 1:28:52.720]  people to stand down so they could get the weapons out the ambassador refused to
[1:28:52.720 --> 1:28:58.080]  be part of it that all later came out and now here we are and we're seeing this
[1:28:58.080 --> 1:29:01.440]  happen so again we'll talk about more after the break but but veterans I'm not

[1:29:19.280 --> 1:29:22.680]  say he's this Russian agent pushing all this crap because the Russians want to
[1:29:22.680 --> 1:29:26.160]  cut our taxes and secure our borders and help the vets give me a break folks
[1:29:26.160 --> 1:29:29.920]  totally made up the Russians aren't even involved in any of this they say I'm a
[1:29:29.920 --> 1:29:33.640]  Russian agent this is the most poppy cop crap I've ever heard my life so this is
[1:29:33.640 --> 1:29:36.640]  what the traders are doing we're gonna come back talk about your website what
[1:29:36.640 --> 1:29:40.240]  you're doing and more straight ahead but again you've got several sites what's
[1:29:40.240 --> 1:29:44.840]  the best site to go to tactical insider comms great name tactical insider dot
[1:29:44.840 --> 1:29:48.880]  com everybody visit that website during the break tactical insider dot com we're
[1:29:48.880 --> 1:30:00.240]  on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network well
[1:30:00.240 --> 1:30:04.240]  it looks like even the establishment mainstream media has to admit that
[1:30:04.240 --> 1:30:10.120]  Rachel Maddow's Trump tax scandal is a big nothing burger if all we get tonight
[1:30:10.120 --> 1:30:14.920]  is that Donald Trump paid 38 million dollars to America's government that's
[1:30:14.920 --> 1:30:19.080]  a good night for Donald Trump sorry there's just really no way like I was
[1:30:19.080 --> 1:30:23.040]  hoping and praying that it would show not only did he pay no taxes he actually
[1:30:23.040 --> 1:30:27.480]  charged the government and got money back sorry to disappoint you Van Jones but
[1:30:27.480 --> 1:30:32.080]  what you liberals thought was going to be a huge Trump scandal ended up being a
[1:30:32.080 --> 1:30:37.040]  big boost to president Donald Trump's reputation as a successful hard-working
[1:30:37.040 --> 1:30:41.560]  American and tax-paying businessman and now we know that Trump actually paid a
[1:30:41.560 --> 1:30:47.200]  high tax rate of roughly 25% compare that to MSNBC's parent company Comcast
[1:30:47.200 --> 1:30:54.520]  which paid 24% Barack Obama 19% and Bernie Sanders who only paid 18% in taxes

[1:33:25.240 --> 1:33:29.880]  huge nationwide protests erupted once again on president Donald Trump's
[1:33:29.880 --> 1:33:41.800]  second weekend in office when you open your heart to patriotism there is no room
[1:33:41.800 --> 1:33:48.960]  for prejudice when America is united America is totally unstoppable Donald
[1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:56.000]  J. Trump is now president of the United States and most importantly we will be
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:14.400]  protected by God from the floodlines of the info it's Alex Jones and we are
[1:34:14.400 --> 1:34:19.000]  back live and let me tell you this place is a war room so much is developing so
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:24.120]  much is happening so much is unfolding right now in studio we have Craig
[1:34:24.120 --> 1:34:29.080]  Sawyer with us a highly decorated Navy SEAL there's also of course worked in a
[1:34:29.080 --> 1:34:32.080]  lot of other agencies and groups we can't even we can't even get into what
[1:34:32.080 --> 1:34:34.760]  SEAL team you're with and I understand none of that was ever supposed to come
[1:34:34.760 --> 1:34:38.760]  out people aren't supposed to quote Pimp the Trident and the rest of it but
[1:34:38.760 --> 1:34:42.520]  why particularly with certain groups are people not even supposed to talk about
[1:34:42.520 --> 1:34:47.440]  what group they were in even if it's known well generally it's it's
[1:34:47.440 --> 1:34:52.000]  operational security we don't want our brothers who continue to operate to have
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:55.440]  any of what they're doing be compromised to the public and to our
[1:34:55.440 --> 1:34:58.400]  enemies so that's really what it's all about so Trump's absolutely right when
[1:34:58.400 --> 1:35:01.200]  he goes no I'm not going to tell you where we're going next or who we're
[1:35:01.200 --> 1:35:05.160]  going to attack next I mean the media I know I was okay even a teenager wondering
[1:35:05.160 --> 1:35:08.040]  why are they saying in the Gulf War what they're about to hit and what they're
[1:35:08.040 --> 1:35:10.960]  about to strike I mean I get that superiority over Saddam but just
[1:35:10.960 --> 1:35:14.800]  growing up reading about war and stuff I knew and they spent weeks figuring out
[1:35:14.800 --> 1:35:19.080]  the right day for D-Day and only the top one or two generals knew until the hour
[1:35:19.080 --> 1:35:23.160]  they launched it yeah yeah true I mean because they had spies inside there if
[1:35:23.160 --> 1:35:26.640]  anybody else knew the Germans would be there it's a simple concept you know
[1:35:26.640 --> 1:35:30.080]  don't give your enemy your playbook D-Day wasn't known until one hour they
[1:35:30.080 --> 1:35:34.280]  had to be ready for weeks just and and we need to get back to that I think we
[1:35:34.280 --> 1:35:41.640]  are that's a good thing expanding on that then what do you make of well you've
[1:35:41.640 --> 1:35:43.800]  got a lot of notes a lot of points or I've got a lot of questions things I
[1:35:43.800 --> 1:35:46.960]  want to get into you you were mentioning the death of MSM and Rachel
[1:35:46.960 --> 1:35:50.880]  Maddow with this ridiculous tax return building it up for hours and then it
[1:35:50.880 --> 1:35:54.160]  just shows Trump paid these huge taxes and the Democrats weren't paying her
[1:35:54.160 --> 1:35:58.240]  taxes and now she's disgraced and even the left is all turning on her eating
[1:35:58.240 --> 1:36:02.440]  their own I think this is a watershed moment because even online we see the
[1:36:02.440 --> 1:36:06.320]  left turning on each other and a mass exodus where they're giving up that's
[1:36:06.320 --> 1:36:09.400]  why they're hitting us with so much censorship now I'm not just saying this
[1:36:09.400 --> 1:36:12.080]  folks I don't tell you we're winning when we're not everybody knows that I was
[1:36:12.080 --> 1:36:14.440]  telling you ten years ago we're getting our ass kicked I was telling you a year
[1:36:14.440 --> 1:36:17.560]  ago Trump was gonna win but I'm telling you we are winning but I don't want to
[1:36:17.560 --> 1:36:21.040]  be too arrogant because we're still in the fight of our lives yeah well you
[1:36:21.040 --> 1:36:26.640]  know it's interesting to watch these talking heads double down on on what
[1:36:26.640 --> 1:36:31.480]  has been disproven so that lets me know that they're not just misinformed
[1:36:31.480 --> 1:36:34.440]  they're they're complicit they are they're dirty they're taking payoffs to
[1:36:34.440 --> 1:36:37.760]  do what to say whatever they are because it's it's not true it's been
[1:36:37.760 --> 1:36:41.160]  demonstrated that's not true so we already know the deal with the the
[1:36:41.160 --> 1:36:45.040]  Russians I know I've got people inside the federal law enforcement and
[1:36:45.040 --> 1:36:51.240]  intelligence community and we know that the the whole thing with with the
[1:36:51.240 --> 1:36:55.640]  Russians is is really being projected from the left the left actually are tied
[1:36:55.640 --> 1:36:59.760]  in with the Russians and they're saying that they've always been the whole
[1:36:59.760 --> 1:37:03.920]  history of Kennedy went you know the senator Kennedy take Kennedy and went
[1:37:03.920 --> 1:37:07.800]  and like try to get all this money to sell off to us publicly yeah that's about
[1:37:07.800 --> 1:37:11.080]  the way I don't mean to interrupt you Roger Stoner they did poison with Polonium I've
[1:37:11.080 --> 1:37:14.120]  seen the reports but the Secret Service asked him not to publish them they've
[1:37:14.120 --> 1:37:16.520]  been death-threading him they're trying to blame him for the Russian stuff they
[1:37:16.520 --> 1:37:20.440]  want to have hearings where he's then blamed in absentia and that's why he's
[1:37:20.440 --> 1:37:26.680]  been had security clearly a t-bone hit-and-runs classic CIA kill style they
[1:37:26.680 --> 1:37:30.560]  almost killed him he's in an ambulance right now guys try to get stone on he's
[1:37:30.560 --> 1:37:34.520]  ready to get on they they hit him bad today out of the blue boom neighborhood
[1:37:34.520 --> 1:37:39.120]  just t-bone him rammed it and then ran off with a with a big truck so what's
[1:37:39.120 --> 1:37:42.320]  that's I mean they're really trying to kill Roger yeah this is not a joke folks
[1:37:42.320 --> 1:37:47.320]  is what we're dealing with here yeah it's it's you know as a federal criminal
[1:37:47.320 --> 1:37:50.400]  investigator tired to know and without maybe I mean it might have been but he
[1:37:50.400 --> 1:37:53.920]  wasn't with Polonium I mean who else would have that you know they've told
[1:37:53.920 --> 1:37:56.320]  him they're coming to kill him doesn't they want to say he's a Russian agent
[1:37:56.320 --> 1:37:58.840]  funny just raised that while I'm reading this they want to say he's a Russian
[1:37:58.840 --> 1:38:01.720]  agent but then kill him and then have the hearings so they don't have the
[1:38:01.720 --> 1:38:06.480]  hearings until he's dead yeah yeah not a good sign he's been told that he's been
[1:38:06.480 --> 1:38:10.440]  told we're going to kill you and he's not grandstanding this guy's been big
[1:38:10.440 --> 1:38:14.000]  in the media for 40 years look this is real Alex that swamp does not want to be
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:18.320]  drained they're desperate right now to hide how far out on a limb they've put
[1:38:18.320 --> 1:38:22.240]  themselves against our people against our country that's why they're cornered
[1:38:22.240 --> 1:38:25.960]  that's why they're so dangerous yeah that's called Roger's cell so you can
[1:38:25.960 --> 1:38:29.640]  pop in right now he's on the way to the hospital you're talking to him now so we
[1:38:29.640 --> 1:38:33.400]  can put him on I was just going off the text messages I mean the craziness we
[1:38:33.400 --> 1:38:35.360]  tell everything Roger's told me that's why they always say he's a big liar
[1:38:35.360 --> 1:38:38.760]  everything's told me he's been accurate he's like super accurate that's what I
[1:38:38.760 --> 1:38:44.080]  hate his guts and they know that you know Trump talks to him and you know yeah
[1:38:44.080 --> 1:38:47.920]  track record track record of your source has to count more than anything else if
[1:38:47.920 --> 1:38:50.720]  they they keep well you're right I mean it could be an accident that he just got
[1:38:50.720 --> 1:38:54.440]  hit and run t-boned but they mean that's how that's a classic way to kill
[1:38:54.440 --> 1:38:59.560]  folks yeah well there are a lot of ways to do it but yeah in time hopefully
[1:38:59.560 --> 1:39:03.000]  the facts will paint a clear enough picture to where we'll know for sure now
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:06.800]  you wouldn't know anything about killing people I misunderstood Alex I'm a
[1:39:06.800 --> 1:39:11.480]  lover no but you're out there protecting folks I am well that's what I feel in my
[1:39:11.480 --> 1:39:15.560]  heart I'm supposed to do you know I'm not afraid of bad guys I'm not afraid of
[1:39:15.560 --> 1:39:19.680]  crooks I'm not afraid of terrorists I'm not afraid of corruption I'm not afraid
[1:39:19.680 --> 1:39:24.160]  of poachers so I go out there and I try to defend the American by the way when I
[1:39:24.160 --> 1:39:27.680]  say you're like a caveman that's not negative they know now from the bones
[1:39:27.680 --> 1:39:31.120]  that cavemen were twice as strong at bigger brains our ancestors were a lot
[1:39:31.120 --> 1:39:34.600]  stronger a lot smarter they built this whole world defeated the you know the
[1:39:34.600 --> 1:39:38.680]  climate the beast the ice ages everything and then now we're just living
[1:39:38.680 --> 1:39:42.320]  off what they built so I say you you're like Fred Flintstone you know me in a
[1:39:42.320 --> 1:39:46.080]  good way I want to be like a caveman as everybody tells you you kind of look
[1:39:46.080 --> 1:39:52.120]  like Chuck Norris it's not gonna stop visit Alex what the caveman sound like
[1:39:52.120 --> 1:39:55.520]  my older brother now that used to torment me growing up but no he said you
[1:39:55.520 --> 1:40:00.120]  were like a caveman yeah yeah among other things Neanderthal I didn't mean that
[1:40:00.120 --> 1:40:04.880]  mean I know you didn't I got a big Neanderthal head to that's good man
[1:40:04.880 --> 1:40:08.240]  aren't you glad you're not a wimp well I you know I tell you what having
[1:40:08.240 --> 1:40:12.240]  overcome fear in several aspects of my life has really empowered me and I've
[1:40:12.240 --> 1:40:16.680]  learned that even in training later training my own children to climb to
[1:40:16.680 --> 1:40:21.240]  swim to ride their bicycle thing that we all parents kind of do I've learned
[1:40:21.240 --> 1:40:26.280]  that I had one kid that trusted me and and put her fear aside and I could teach
[1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:32.040]  her to do anything within minutes and and the other child was really dependent
[1:40:32.040 --> 1:40:37.000]  upon his own ability and hey boy Papa's got you really didn't mean anything to
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:40.800]  him because he was counting on having it having it all safe and wired himself and
[1:40:40.800 --> 1:40:44.480]  so it took him more than 10 times as long to learn to ride his bike and other
[1:40:44.480 --> 1:40:50.220]  things than she did because he was he was fearful when girls are easier to
[1:40:50.220 --> 1:40:57.240]  train well it's in a good way they're they are they're they're intelligent and
[1:40:57.240 --> 1:41:00.440]  so forth but for me it all comes back to the best shooter you know as a woman
[1:41:00.440 --> 1:41:04.040]  well yeah yeah nomazin's master is the best long-range shooter I think I've
[1:41:04.040 --> 1:41:09.800]  ever witnessed in person she's she's fantastic but anyway it all comes back
[1:41:09.800 --> 1:41:13.960]  to the fear when you can overcome the fear that's the most crippling barrier
[1:41:13.960 --> 1:41:18.040]  for accomplishing anything in your life is fear so when we can overcome that man
[1:41:18.040 --> 1:41:22.640]  there's there's a lot more performance in and success that can be gained at
[1:41:22.640 --> 1:41:27.880]  anything so absolutely do we have any word on Roger guys all right now we'll
[1:41:27.880 --> 1:41:29.600]  keep you a little bit the next time they're gonna take something from the
[1:41:29.600 --> 1:41:33.120]  nightly news obviously you don't care about the fear you've gone through the
[1:41:33.120 --> 1:41:40.840]  fear and it's made you stronger for me I have fear of failure and fear of scum
[1:41:40.840 --> 1:41:43.960]  dominating me like I don't want to dominate other people that are more
[1:41:43.960 --> 1:41:47.080]  successful than me I don't hate other people that are you know doing well I
[1:41:47.080 --> 1:41:51.240]  admire it as long as it isn't at somebody else's expense but then when
[1:41:51.240 --> 1:41:55.280]  somebody is a scammer and the idea of somebody weaker than me getting other
[1:41:55.280 --> 1:41:59.240]  people under their control absolutely drives me crazy and without me even
[1:41:59.240 --> 1:42:02.640]  talking about that you were bringing up the fact that it's actually weak people
[1:42:02.640 --> 1:42:05.680]  that try to set up evil systems and that's true I mean these globalists are
[1:42:05.680 --> 1:42:08.000]  the biggest cowards in the world that's what I've learned and I'll say this to
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  kiss the military's ass but especially people that have really been in a lot of
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:14.520]  harm's way and veterans they hate the innate confidence they hate the fact
[1:42:14.520 --> 1:42:19.520]  that you you know you have empowered them for their agenda in some cases so
[1:42:19.520 --> 1:42:22.360]  they admire you but also hate you at the same time and that's why they treat
[1:42:22.360 --> 1:42:26.440]  the veterans so bad it's why they do this because they innately cannot stand
[1:42:26.440 --> 1:42:29.680]  honorable strong people like you get around special operations folks have
[1:42:29.680 --> 1:42:35.400]  seen a lot of combat confident happy fun get the job done great people smart the
[1:42:35.400 --> 1:42:37.840]  best people out there I'm gonna send that because you were in this it's true
[1:42:37.840 --> 1:42:41.720]  that no wonder Trump loves veterans and special forces people he's been around
[1:42:41.720 --> 1:42:45.120]  them a lot and he's found whether it's corporate executives that are honorable
[1:42:45.120 --> 1:42:49.120]  our special forces types those are the best people he's found that are go-getters
[1:42:49.120 --> 1:42:52.400]  that are confident that aren't cowards that are involved and want to build
[1:42:52.400 --> 1:42:57.520]  things for everybody and see everybody as a team because we're individuals but
[1:42:57.520 --> 1:43:01.640]  we're also have a collective understanding and have a thrill off of
[1:43:01.640 --> 1:43:05.320]  other people's success the globalists are missing that they're smart but they're
[1:43:05.320 --> 1:43:13.680]  twisted tyrants and predators prey upon the fearful and if we unite as a group
[1:43:13.680 --> 1:43:19.320]  of veterans as a country is as a population against the tyrants
[1:43:19.320 --> 1:43:24.640]  against the subversives that are attacking our president right now we
[1:43:24.640 --> 1:43:29.760]  can disempower them and regain control of our country in a larger way so I
[1:43:29.760 --> 1:43:34.560]  think it really we all need to unite together we are what we can't be alone
[1:43:34.560 --> 1:43:40.240]  a nation and our only our enemies want us divided so if I see any so-called
[1:43:40.240 --> 1:43:44.480]  leader causing division I've got a real problem with that I question that that
[1:43:44.480 --> 1:43:48.000]  motive and and what is President Trump saying he's saying let's come together
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:52.880]  all Americans let's assimilate let's let's all enjoy the freedom liberty and
[1:43:52.880 --> 1:43:57.600]  prosperity together as Americans isn't that deep down isn't that what we want
[1:43:57.600 --> 1:44:01.160]  I mean that's what Trump's promoting is unity they call it division well the
[1:44:01.160 --> 1:44:04.040]  only reason people could have a problem with it is because they're hearing that
[1:44:04.040 --> 1:44:07.640]  he eats puppies or that he you know matches kittens paws or whatever the
[1:44:07.640 --> 1:44:11.800]  the crazy stuff is being pedaled from the left daily but now I think
[1:44:11.800 --> 1:44:14.760]  increasingly Americans are starting to see wait a minute what they're saying
[1:44:14.760 --> 1:44:19.160]  is not true we're actually seeing factually laid out that what is coming
[1:44:19.160 --> 1:44:23.400]  out of MSNBC and other outlets is just completely false in so many cases so
[1:44:23.400 --> 1:44:26.840]  why do they keep why do they keep pushing this which leads me into another
[1:44:26.840 --> 1:44:31.600]  point Alex that I want to make we need to understand as Americans where we're
[1:44:31.600 --> 1:44:36.160]  getting our information who is peddling our our talking points and our
[1:44:36.160 --> 1:44:41.040]  thoughts ultimately and correct me if I'm wrong all of the major news outlets
[1:44:41.040 --> 1:44:44.800]  in the United States are ultimately owned by only six entities it was six
[1:44:44.800 --> 1:44:49.360]  it's like four now okay and I challenge people to look at Chinese
[1:44:49.360 --> 1:44:53.560]  communists are buying those those four entities and what are their outlooks
[1:44:53.560 --> 1:44:57.880]  what are there six studios and four news groups well they can say five but
[1:44:57.880 --> 1:45:00.880]  you're yeah exactly so what are they doing what are their views about the
[1:45:00.880 --> 1:45:03.560]  United States what do they want they want to get rid of it they admit that
[1:45:03.560 --> 1:45:07.480]  do they love the United States and want us empowered and free or do they want
[1:45:07.480 --> 1:45:13.440]  to subjugate us do they want to to to gain dominance over us so I think we've
[1:45:13.440 --> 1:45:19.000]  really got to peel the blinders off America to to look at who's feeding us
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:22.360]  our information go wait a minute what are their motives why are they saying
[1:45:22.360 --> 1:45:26.240]  these things that aren't true and why are so many people buying it and just
[1:45:26.240 --> 1:45:29.760]  taking it wholesale and regurgitating it to all their friends absolutely and I'm
[1:45:29.760 --> 1:45:31.960]  not gonna cut into your time or do five minutes the next hour they're gonna take
[1:45:31.960 --> 1:45:35.320]  for the nightly news tonight again what's the best website Craig for folks
[1:45:35.320 --> 1:45:39.120]  to visit tactical insider.com and we're gonna get about the email address the
[1:45:39.120 --> 1:45:42.720]  photos are starting to flood in we're gonna post them to info wars.com of
[1:45:42.720 --> 1:45:46.360]  veterans and active duty active duty can do this too now with your face say I
[1:45:46.360 --> 1:45:49.600]  support my commander-in-chief and this has a big powerful thing because they're
[1:45:49.600 --> 1:45:53.720]  trying to look the military and Congress and the CIA say he's a Russian agent with
[1:45:53.720 --> 1:45:58.960]  zero evidence now Roger Stone is there it was talking to him earlier in text
[1:45:58.960 --> 1:46:02.720]  messages getting an ambulance are going to the hospital just had a hit-and-run he
[1:46:02.720 --> 1:46:06.000]  got hit with polonium they said oh we're gonna call him to Congress they got hit
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:08.360]  with polonium and they dropped the congressional hearing they're still
[1:46:08.360 --> 1:46:12.600]  trying to say he's a Russian agent with no evidence it's just an amazing time
[1:46:12.600 --> 1:46:16.120]  so Roger thanks for popping in with us so yeah well you've been through a lot
[1:46:16.120 --> 1:46:22.720]  here what just happened well about an hour ago I was driving on my way to a
[1:46:22.720 --> 1:46:31.280]  speech in Orlando later this afternoon and my car was t-boned by a car coming
[1:46:31.280 --> 1:46:37.400]  out of nowhere the windshield so darkly tinted you could see not see who was
[1:46:37.400 --> 1:46:42.320]  inside the car it was starting the airbags went off and they came in at
[1:46:42.320 --> 1:46:49.120]  the passenger door where I was seated and then the driver threw it in reverse
[1:46:49.120 --> 1:46:55.440]  even though he had sustained some damage and took off there were either were no
[1:46:55.440 --> 1:46:59.680]  plates or they were not identifiable although frankly the whole matter I
[1:46:59.680 --> 1:47:02.440]  could see your face on the jaws bruised by the airbags you're saying you're
[1:47:02.440 --> 1:47:06.640]  empty of the hospital clearly we talked about they need to kill you before they
[1:47:06.640 --> 1:47:09.360]  have the hearings because you're supposed to the master Russian agent
[1:47:09.360 --> 1:47:13.280]  another thing you're in touch with Goose over yet a public account trying to get
[1:47:13.280 --> 1:47:16.560]  him to come on air no one's no one's hiding that we wanted the WikiLeaks show
[1:47:16.560 --> 1:47:21.600]  Roger what do you think this is well look I think I've been poisoned I've been
[1:47:21.600 --> 1:47:28.160]  smeared if you you know I am responding and pointing out the problems with the
[1:47:28.160 --> 1:47:34.840]  headline Trump associate was in touch with a Russian hacker that's a false
[1:47:34.840 --> 1:47:41.080]  narrative but I notice on Facebook and Google and Twitter my retweets are down
[1:47:41.080 --> 1:47:48.040]  substantially when I defend myself with the facts the fact my contact excuse me
[1:47:48.040 --> 1:47:54.600]  was was after the hacking demonstrates that I could not have colluding we were
[1:47:54.600 --> 1:47:57.640]  trying to get used to for 2.0 on and WikiLeaks and everybody the media does
[1:47:57.640 --> 1:48:00.400]  that too they I mean they just think the public's done they said the New York
[1:48:00.400 --> 1:48:06.680]  Times that they were surveilling Trump with wiretaps on January 20th we talked
[1:48:06.680 --> 1:48:09.920]  about we did a whole show on it we showed it and then now they're saying that
[1:48:09.920 --> 1:48:13.920]  never happened it's insane he's crazy there were no wiretaps the present the
[1:48:13.920 --> 1:48:18.920]  problem here is much larger Alex and that's because of the smoking gun who
[1:48:18.920 --> 1:48:22.840]  made these fraudulent allegations if you read their entire story which is a
[1:48:22.840 --> 1:48:27.840]  smear piece and several other stories published the same day from other left
[1:48:27.840 --> 1:48:33.680]  you think news sites all contain information that could only have been
[1:48:33.680 --> 1:48:38.560]  gleaned if I were under surveillance only if someone were had actually they
[1:48:38.560 --> 1:48:42.040]  admit you were under the FISA court that's been in the New York Times too if
[1:48:42.040 --> 1:48:45.840]  that's true then leaking that information to the smoking gun is a felony
[1:48:45.840 --> 1:48:50.400]  punishable by 10 years in jail but no one's no one's being surveilled though
[1:48:50.400 --> 1:48:55.200]  our phone calls with Trump and all of it have been recorded and they admit oh
[1:48:55.200 --> 1:48:58.920]  FISA court did thing on you but nobody's under surveillance is crazy Roger well
[1:48:58.920 --> 1:49:03.080]  and they continue to deny that Trump was under surveillance let me say this Alex
[1:49:03.080 --> 1:49:07.800]  Trump has been under surveillance since the Bush presidency he was under
[1:49:07.800 --> 1:49:12.280]  surveillance both in New York and Palm Beach I have reason to believe at some
[1:49:12.280 --> 1:49:18.280]  point that surveillance ended but was turned back on by the Obama administration
[1:49:18.280 --> 1:49:23.920]  I know they're denying all of this but Nixon denied Watergate for over a year
[1:49:23.920 --> 1:49:28.320]  well the Poletano says he has four sources and this is coming out from
[1:49:28.320 --> 1:49:31.200]  traditional watches well they were using the British which they always do they
[1:49:31.200 --> 1:49:34.400]  use the foreign intelligence to spawn people domestically vice versa to get
[1:49:34.400 --> 1:49:39.760]  around those laws yeah precisely so it's this is all going to come out and the
[1:49:39.760 --> 1:49:44.760]  worst part for them is their rationale for spying on Trump IE he was in touch
[1:49:44.760 --> 1:49:49.200]  with the Russians there was agents is proving to be false at the exact time
[1:49:49.200 --> 1:49:53.920]  that their surveillance of the president has been exposed that's why the deep
[1:49:53.920 --> 1:49:59.080]  state is trying to take me out they poisoned me they have smeared me and
[1:49:59.080 --> 1:50:03.680]  now somebody in a car trying to kill me I'm gonna tell you better start
[1:50:03.680 --> 1:50:06.920]  watching your butt because I mean like you said they have announced all these
[1:50:06.920 --> 1:50:10.640]  hearings when you didn't die they you know they should announce hearings you
[1:50:10.640 --> 1:50:13.840]  get poisoned you don't die as she didn't drink the whole drink or whatever we
[1:50:13.840 --> 1:50:17.360]  don't know what happened and now that they want you gone so they can kill the
[1:50:17.360 --> 1:50:22.480]  straw man in a congressional committee is it is it coincidental that only in
[1:50:22.480 --> 1:50:27.800]  the last 48 hours John McCain called for Senate hearings and specifically huge
[1:50:27.800 --> 1:50:31.580]  in fact I told you guys the John McCain calls for Senate hearings on
[1:50:31.580 --> 1:50:34.080]  Roger Stone that's been all over the news I wanted to play that clip the other
[1:50:34.080 --> 1:50:38.560]  day yeah he calls you out and this happens and and he says specifically I
[1:50:38.560 --> 1:50:45.120]  should be questioned about my ties to the Russians and to Yukonovich Alex why
[1:50:45.120 --> 1:50:50.600]  is he making these kind of baseless reckless charges I have no ties to the
[1:50:50.600 --> 1:50:58.400]  Russians or Yukonovich so I have to ask myself does Senator McCain have left no
[1:50:58.400 --> 1:51:04.520]  sense of decency with these completely phony made up witch hunt charges and
[1:51:04.520 --> 1:51:10.040]  then yes Craig Sawyer again top and retired Navy SEAL combat expert
[1:51:10.040 --> 1:51:13.040]  researcher you name it I mean you have any statements running for Roger for
[1:51:13.040 --> 1:51:20.480]  letting go no I wish I wish some of this didn't sound so familiar though sad it's
[1:51:20.480 --> 1:51:24.040]  sad to see you better watch out they do not want you in those hearings they
[1:51:24.040 --> 1:51:27.320]  want to have those hearings they want you dead man but I was you I've stopped
[1:51:27.320 --> 1:51:31.960]  running around all these events you're at right to drive an armored car you know
[1:51:31.960 --> 1:51:36.560]  what I'm not giving up this country without a fight and I'm not going to be
[1:51:36.560 --> 1:51:41.080]  silenced I'm not going to be censored and I'm not going to be intimidated this is
[1:51:41.080 --> 1:51:44.440]  why I love info wars you can come here and tell the truth no I agree but
[1:51:44.440 --> 1:51:48.440]  digitally you can reach more people than running around all these events all I'm
[1:51:48.440 --> 1:51:51.720]  telling you is you need to demand the hearing before I would I would tweet I
[1:51:51.720 --> 1:51:55.240]  demand the hearings before they kill me I've been poisoned I've been hit by car
[1:51:55.240 --> 1:51:58.560]  nobody's got polonium you I mean I think we need to get you in front of
[1:51:58.560 --> 1:52:02.120]  Congress right now they're scared of that Roger let's get to the hospital get
[1:52:02.120 --> 1:52:06.320]  taken care of we'll talk to you soon but my people insist that I go in for it to
[1:52:06.320 --> 1:52:12.440]  be checked on I feel fine Alex I was very lucky I think the airbag saved me the
[1:52:12.440 --> 1:52:17.360]  local police took an hour to show up and take the report but that's South
[1:52:17.360 --> 1:52:21.700]  Florida maybe this was an accident but the polonium's not go ahead jump in seem
[1:52:21.700 --> 1:52:27.840]  like an accident to me I do have one thing I I believe President Trump can
[1:52:27.840 --> 1:52:33.320]  and should assert himself very forcefully upon our intelligence community
[1:52:33.320 --> 1:52:38.840]  and and reestablish his commander's intent for the course of the United
[1:52:38.840 --> 1:52:45.160]  States of America and put a stop to this subversive action and I think he can
[1:52:45.160 --> 1:52:49.160]  and should do that so let's let's hope that happens soon absolutely because
[1:52:49.160 --> 1:52:54.360]  look I mean there's no doubt that every day newspapers rap stars rock stars
[1:52:54.360 --> 1:52:58.480]  movie stars everywhere say kill Trump kill Trump Trump had to respond and say
[1:52:58.480 --> 1:53:02.280]  why a soup saying kill me if this is Obama he'd be arrested well the
[1:53:02.280 --> 1:53:05.520]  president has the power to say you know do something about this the kind I'm
[1:53:05.520 --> 1:53:08.480]  not looking for some war with these people we're beating them intellectually
[1:53:08.480 --> 1:53:12.080]  but at a certain point we just can't let them sit there and call for our
[1:53:12.080 --> 1:53:17.600]  murder constantly Roger get get checked out and go ahead my final point is
[1:53:17.600 --> 1:53:20.840]  very clear the president can do two things immediately and I hope he will
[1:53:20.840 --> 1:53:24.800]  first of all release all government documents having to do with the
[1:53:24.800 --> 1:53:28.720]  surveillance of those who are allegedly in touch with Russians or any
[1:53:28.720 --> 1:53:32.960]  surveillance pertaining to down from release at all number one number two
[1:53:32.960 --> 1:53:37.480]  the Attorney General should impanel a grand jury if not he then a special
[1:53:37.480 --> 1:53:41.800]  prosecutor that's fine would make and sure I would be happy to testify and
[1:53:41.800 --> 1:53:47.040]  you can examine the so-called Russian collusion but you must also call John
[1:53:47.040 --> 1:53:53.360]  Brennan James Clapper Ash Carter Loretta Lynch and perhaps you all
[1:53:53.360 --> 1:53:57.240]  leaked it let me ask you this why does the MSM because the internal WikiLeaks
[1:53:57.240 --> 1:54:00.080]  came out you they talked about me you and I and they said we've got it we've
[1:54:00.080 --> 1:54:04.720]  stopped the MVP in the same email attacking you and I'm kind of a little
[1:54:04.720 --> 1:54:07.600]  bit jealous that they called you the MVP and not me but it's it's it's talking
[1:54:07.600 --> 1:54:11.760]  about us on the show why are you the MVP I mean because they've been I mean this
[1:54:11.760 --> 1:54:16.120]  is the Democrat Party run David Brock we're like we've take we've gotten the
[1:54:16.120 --> 1:54:21.320]  MVP banned off the nose crap perhaps they realized that I'm the ultimate Trump
[1:54:21.320 --> 1:54:25.560]  loyalist I love Donald Trump I have deep affection for him and his and his
[1:54:25.560 --> 1:54:29.560]  family and I've always thought he had the leadership qualities and the skill
[1:54:29.560 --> 1:54:32.440]  you're the one that introduced him to Nixon you're the one that launched it
[1:54:32.440 --> 1:54:36.160]  you don't take credit just take credit no I'm not going to take credit but I
[1:54:36.160 --> 1:54:41.080]  like the hope that I have been a great assistance and perhaps that's why I am
[1:54:41.080 --> 1:54:46.760]  targeted also Alex look at my work I exposed the CIA in my book on the
[1:54:46.760 --> 1:54:50.840]  Kennedy assassination I exposed them again in their real role in Watergate I
[1:54:50.840 --> 1:54:55.640]  exposed them involved with the Clintons running drugs through Arkansas I exposed
[1:54:55.640 --> 1:55:00.600]  them in my book on Benghazi I exposed them in this book in terms of the whole
[1:55:00.600 --> 1:55:05.800]  Russia thing that's a criminal element to the CIA staff yes I am a consistent
[1:55:05.800 --> 1:55:09.800]  critic of the deep state that's why I think I am targeted all right we'll talk
[1:55:09.800 --> 1:55:12.840]  to you soon glad you survived this thank you we're gonna do five of us next
[1:55:12.840 --> 1:55:17.480]  hours we have more time looking at this though and you've got a lot of their
[1:55:17.480 --> 1:55:19.960]  points we don't kind of digress into all this with Roger Stone but it's still
[1:55:19.960 --> 1:55:24.000]  important you can't say oh look they claim they tried to kill him he's been
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:27.560]  hit with polonium and they're all over the news saying kill us so anything that
[1:55:27.560 --> 1:55:33.720]  happens to us now those that have said kill us are suspects yeah yeah well I
[1:55:33.720 --> 1:55:39.320]  with with someone like Roger I think one way to do it is put people around him
[1:55:39.320 --> 1:55:43.320]  and roll up whoever moves in to try to try to he's got to be followed by
[1:55:43.320 --> 1:55:48.080]  professionals yeah yeah yeah low-key so that that guy that hit him would then be
[1:55:48.080 --> 1:55:52.040]  chased down then we catch him then we've got that fish and and figure out what
[1:55:52.040 --> 1:55:55.520]  makes him tick who sent him and all the other that comes with it when you start
[1:55:55.520 --> 1:55:59.600]  doing that to not just him but we talked about this yesterday they're saying kill
[1:55:59.600 --> 1:56:02.440]  us they're saying attack us when all we're trying to do is turn America back
[1:56:02.440 --> 1:56:06.400]  on just be good people there they're moved in two miles away they're saying
[1:56:06.400 --> 1:56:09.840]  we're gonna overthrow the president holder says he's coming Obama's coming
[1:56:09.840 --> 1:56:14.520]  like he's Messianic the globalists of the Chinese and Soros have doubled the
[1:56:14.520 --> 1:56:18.680]  amount of riot funding you know to the black nationalist groups then as a
[1:56:18.680 --> 1:56:22.440]  former Navy SEAL and in all sorts of clandestine operations you name it I
[1:56:22.440 --> 1:56:25.480]  mean yet your gut level what should the president do I mean he's the president
[1:56:25.480 --> 1:56:30.720]  well we call it commanders intent and in the military and the commander in chief
[1:56:30.720 --> 1:56:35.960]  is is our commander as a nation and he needs to insert himself in my opinion
[1:56:35.960 --> 1:56:40.000]  now again I don't represent the Navy SEAL teams I speak on my own it's yourself
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:45.720]  I'm sorry I want to make that clear because if I say something goofy you know
[1:56:45.720 --> 1:56:49.000]  this point it's so go ahead so looking around a camera for tell tell tell
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:53.320]  America what to do well we need to rally around the president we need to
[1:56:53.320 --> 1:56:57.640]  identify those that are attacking him and we need to visit greater scrutiny
[1:56:57.640 --> 1:57:01.840]  upon them including starting investigations and rounding them up
[1:57:01.840 --> 1:57:05.560]  making prosecutions where appropriate and so many of them are already felons
[1:57:05.560 --> 1:57:09.040]  they're fugitives right now because they have not been convicted and that needs
[1:57:09.040 --> 1:57:12.720]  to start happening those who are crooked who are attacking our lawfully
[1:57:12.720 --> 1:57:17.280]  elected president who's acting in good faith to carry out the agenda that we
[1:57:17.280 --> 1:57:24.040]  elected him to carry out doing our will he's he's carrying out our will we need
[1:57:24.040 --> 1:57:26.680]  to bring those convictions and the people that are crooked need to start
[1:57:26.680 --> 1:57:32.200]  getting yanked out of their limousines and their fancy high-rise office buildings
[1:57:32.200 --> 1:57:35.680]  in their mansions and brought to justice they are if the ones that are
[1:57:35.680 --> 1:57:38.920]  crooked need to be brought to justice that's we need to get back to being a
[1:57:38.920 --> 1:57:43.480]  lawful right peaceful society these when Newsweek says a case for rioting go out
[1:57:43.480 --> 1:57:47.000]  and shoot cops burn things in an article you grab the editor you grab the
[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:51.080]  the reporting you get them in who told you to write that who told that's not
[1:57:51.080 --> 1:57:55.360]  free speech saying go out and kill people I mean we're not the ones looking for
[1:57:55.360 --> 1:57:58.560]  trouble here they're the ones trying to have a physical war we're trying to
[1:57:58.560 --> 1:58:01.480]  stop it was like you said we keep letting this go doesn't matter we're
[1:58:01.480 --> 1:58:03.960]  politically wanting doesn't matter we're turning the country back on they're
[1:58:03.960 --> 1:58:08.240]  creating an army of people to do this yeah well as a federal criminal
[1:58:08.240 --> 1:58:12.120]  investigator if you're investigating a drug ring you catch the little fish you
[1:58:12.120 --> 1:58:15.960]  get information for him you climb that network and you get a little bit bigger
[1:58:15.960 --> 1:58:19.320]  fish and bigger fish when you do the same thing with these subversives
[1:58:19.320 --> 1:58:24.040]  who are attacking our country right now by going after our president Greg
[1:58:24.040 --> 1:58:26.880]  Sawyer is our guest when come back we're putting the call out not just to
[1:58:26.880 --> 1:58:30.600]  veterans or active duty but to citizens as well what are we gonna do to support
[1:58:30.600 --> 1:58:33.680]  Trump because you claim you want to take America back you want to battle for
[1:58:33.680 --> 1:58:40.080]  the Republic this is it the war is happening now back in 70 seconds

[1:58:54.680 --> 1:58:58.760]  benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets a processed junk we are
[1:58:58.760 --> 1:59:02.680]  now introducing caveman by infowarslife.com the ultimate and true
[1:59:02.680 --> 1:59:08.000]  paleo nutrition with bone broth turmeric root chaga mushroom and seven total
[1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:12.600]  primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula caveman it's those
[1:59:12.600 --> 1:59:16.040]  people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are
[1:59:16.040 --> 1:59:19.520]  our superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture them
[1:59:19.520 --> 1:59:23.680]  everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal you use the meat
[1:59:23.680 --> 1:59:28.360]  for sustenance the fat for cooking but you use the bones for strength from the
[1:59:28.360 --> 1:59:32.560]  outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces
[1:59:32.560 --> 1:59:37.000]  the blood for the body this is the engine of the life essence I'm a long way
[1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:40.720]  from the caveman my ancestors were but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to
[1:59:40.720 --> 1:59:44.360]  that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it I know

[1:59:47.440 --> 1:59:50.800]  infowarslife.com today
[1:59:51.520 --> 1:59:56.840]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:59:56.840 --> 2:00:26.800]  You want answers? Well, so does he. It's Alex Jones. Well, he started out in the Marines and killed till field team 1 and he went to the Naval Special Warfare Development Group and a lot of other places after that. Greg Sawyer is our guest. He didn't want to plug his stuff but I want to plug patrons like him that are out there taking action. Talk about Twitter,
[2:00:26.800 --> 2:00:31.760]  Facebook you name it more and more restricting his whole program to in poaching in
[2:00:31.760 --> 2:00:36.040]  Africa that's that's been so successful just the last five minutes just your
[2:00:36.040 --> 2:00:39.560]  other points on that and where you see this going and also tell us about these
[2:00:39.560 --> 2:00:46.360]  awesome sandals. Well, you know again it's all about rallying around our
[2:00:46.360 --> 2:00:50.600]  president and defending him so that he can carry out our will as a nation so
[2:00:50.600 --> 2:00:53.400]  that's a good thing these are good times and there's no reason why every
[2:00:53.400 --> 2:00:57.800]  American shouldn't be jumping up and down and shouting right now in
[2:00:57.800 --> 2:01:00.960]  celebration that we've got a guy that represents us in there. Oh, this is the
[2:01:00.960 --> 2:01:09.280]  coolest sandals I've ever seen. It's got you on one foot and it's got your signature inside the other. That's actually me on both feet on the bottom. This is by
[2:01:09.280 --> 2:01:14.360]  Kobe and they're a surf sandal family run run business and they've been in the
[2:01:14.360 --> 2:01:20.720]  business for a long time. By the way, I told you to do this. I said I want you to talk about how you're funding your operation. Yeah, this is awesome. How do folks get this to the other
[2:01:20.720 --> 2:01:25.400]  website? They can get these on Bass Pro at Bass Pro. They can get them at Cabela's,
[2:01:25.400 --> 2:01:30.160]  Gander Mountain, Ron John, Flip Flop Shops and stuff like that. They made
[2:01:30.160 --> 2:01:34.000]  these at Kevlar and they warranty them for a long time. They give a piece to
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:38.600]  Operation Hawkeye that helps the families of our fallen warriors. And tell
[2:01:38.600 --> 2:01:42.200]  folks how they get them again. Great stuff. Gander Mountain, Bass Pro Shops or
[2:01:42.200 --> 2:01:46.800]  just go online and Google Sawman Signature Series Sandals from Kobe and
[2:01:46.800 --> 2:01:50.600]  and you'll pop them up there on Amazon and everywhere else. So kind of a fun
[2:01:50.600 --> 2:01:55.160]  little deal. Thanks for my share. I appreciate it. Helping with, you know, this
[2:01:55.160 --> 2:02:01.320]  this steers energy and and and attention back to our community. They're scared we
[2:02:01.320 --> 2:02:04.440]  create our own economy and vote with our dollars to support those that are
[2:02:04.440 --> 2:02:07.320]  supporting everybody else and then folks that want to have prosperity in the
[2:02:07.320 --> 2:02:13.480]  future and love God and country and family and everything else. Again, I'm
[2:02:13.480 --> 2:02:16.080]  going to give you the email address folks if you're veterans but also just
[2:02:16.080 --> 2:02:20.720]  citizens where you can support the president, send in photos, send in
[2:02:20.720 --> 2:02:25.720]  articles, send in things you've done, videos, whatever it is, get involved, get
[2:02:25.720 --> 2:02:28.960]  hurt, call into C-SPAN if you're a veteran or just a citizen. Put that on
[2:02:28.960 --> 2:02:30.840]  YouTube or send us a clip. We'll put it up.
[2:02:30.840 --> 2:02:35.560]  TrumpSupportAtInfoWars.com, TrumpSupportInfoWars.com and send those
[2:02:35.560 --> 2:02:39.920]  photos to get this ball rolling so other veterans see it and take action. In the
[2:02:39.920 --> 2:02:44.960]  two and a half minutes we have left Greg Sawyer, other messages to the
[2:02:44.960 --> 2:02:48.560]  president who's obviously on a military guide but is under attack and doing all
[2:02:48.560 --> 2:02:52.400]  this. What else would you say to the president? I would say to the president
[2:02:52.400 --> 2:02:56.120]  that we are behind you. Everybody that I know that has served served to defend the
[2:02:56.120 --> 2:02:59.440]  freedom and liberty of the people of the United States and we appreciate a
[2:02:59.440 --> 2:03:04.160]  president who is pro-military, who is pro-freedom and liberty, is pro-American
[2:03:04.160 --> 2:03:08.440]  economy and security and everything else. So I would have the president be
[2:03:08.440 --> 2:03:13.560]  encouraged and inspired by so many who are rallying around him. I defend his
[2:03:13.560 --> 2:03:21.040]  back against all comers there in the cesspool of Washington DC. And again, it's
[2:03:21.040 --> 2:03:25.160]  not that we are the best or even perfect. We're not to get people. The globalists
[2:03:25.160 --> 2:03:29.320]  admit in their own documents in WikiLeaks they want to make us cold, dark,
[2:03:29.320 --> 2:03:33.200]  alone, desperate. Those are quotes so they can and they sound like
[2:03:33.200 --> 2:03:37.040]  villains in these emails like oh we'll make them really poor. I mean it's like
[2:03:37.040 --> 2:03:40.480]  who the hell are these people? Then you ask who the hell are we letting them get
[2:03:40.480 --> 2:03:44.240]  to this point. Yeah, well a lot of them come to find out or pedophiles. I'm
[2:03:44.240 --> 2:03:49.600]  starting to hear from insiders that a lot of these globalists, very powerful, but
[2:03:49.600 --> 2:03:54.880]  they've been allowed to grow very, very perverse and strange in their
[2:03:54.880 --> 2:04:01.600]  uber lifestyle. And they do some pretty ugly, I would say
[2:04:01.600 --> 2:04:06.720]  demonic stuff to children. And again, that's sources you have high level. Yes,
[2:04:06.720 --> 2:04:09.760]  sir. I know we talked about this summit last night. I didn't know if you
[2:04:09.760 --> 2:04:13.520]  want to go there. You're gonna tape a piece for the nightly news. I've got
[2:04:13.520 --> 2:04:16.640]  other guests coming up at my god. If you want to go there, I mean just give us
[2:04:16.640 --> 2:04:19.560]  the data. You're gonna host like a 15-minute segment. So you're gonna be
[2:04:19.560 --> 2:04:22.400]  the host. Hey, we're here in poor's nightly news. Q can jump in if he wants
[2:04:22.400 --> 2:04:25.360]  with his perspective. But I think, you know, this is something you should talk
[2:04:25.360 --> 2:04:28.160]  about then, you know, as well as other issues for the nightly news tonight. Yeah,
[2:04:28.160 --> 2:04:31.920]  well, I'm inclined to highlight it a little bit. I'd leave my source to to be
[2:04:31.920 --> 2:04:36.640]  the one to carry on forward because, and you know, you know who he is. But it's
[2:04:36.640 --> 2:04:40.160]  it's an important aspect of who these people are. They're not they don't seem
[2:04:40.160 --> 2:04:44.040]  to subscribe to the win-win mentality. They want to dominate. They can hurt
[2:04:44.040 --> 2:04:47.720]  something new and young and ruin its life. They even kill them. It's better. They
[2:04:47.720 --> 2:04:51.640]  don't seem to all about them. Yeah. So with their their quest for power, they
[2:04:51.640 --> 2:04:54.720]  want to dominate the United States, but they don't want to empower the American
[2:04:54.720 --> 2:04:58.600]  citizen, have us prosperous and Craig. I got another guest coming on, but do two
[2:04:58.600 --> 2:05:01.040]  more minutes on the other side. This is important. Well, it looks like even the
[2:05:01.040 --> 2:05:05.960]  establishment mainstream media has to admit that Rachel Maddow's Trump tax
[2:05:05.960 --> 2:05:11.680]  scandal is a big nothing burger. If all we get tonight is that Donald Trump paid
[2:05:11.680 --> 2:05:15.520]  thirty eight million dollars to America's government. That's a good night for
[2:05:15.520 --> 2:05:20.000]  Donald Trump. I'm sorry. There's just really no way. Like I was hoping and praying
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:23.840]  that it would show not only he paid no taxes, he actually charged the government
[2:05:23.840 --> 2:05:28.040]  and got money back. Sorry to disappoint you, Van Jones, but what you liberals
[2:05:28.040 --> 2:05:32.800]  thought was going to be a huge Trump scandal ended up being a big boost to
[2:05:32.800 --> 2:05:37.680]  President Donald Trump's reputation as a successful, hardworking American and
[2:05:37.680 --> 2:05:42.040]  tax paying businessman. And now we know that Trump actually paid a high tax
[2:05:42.040 --> 2:05:46.360]  rate of roughly twenty five percent. Compare that to MSNBC's parent company
[2:05:46.360 --> 2:05:51.040]  Comcast, which paid twenty four percent, Barack Obama, nineteen percent, and
[2:05:51.040 --> 2:05:55.040]  Bernie Sanders, who only paid eighteen percent in taxes. Read them and weep
[2:05:55.040 --> 2:06:01.120]  snowflakes and you can learn more right now at info wars dot com. This is Alex
[2:06:01.120 --> 2:06:05.200]  Jones. I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best

[2:06:59.720 --> 2:07:03.400]  pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm
[2:07:03.400 --> 2:07:06.840]  on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy. You've all heard the
[2:07:06.840 --> 2:07:10.200]  shocking statistics. Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care,
[2:07:10.200 --> 2:07:15.160]  nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes,
[2:07:15.160 --> 2:07:19.120]  cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant. One out of three

[2:07:57.360 --> 2:08:15.360]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[2:08:15.360 --> 2:08:18.240]  In just two or three minutes we're going to James O'Keefe, the Consulate
[2:08:18.240 --> 2:08:21.360]  investigative journalist, talk about some of his new big developments and
[2:08:21.360 --> 2:08:24.920]  discoveries at Project Veritas. The finishing up with Craig Sawyer because
[2:08:24.920 --> 2:08:29.960]  this former retired top Navy SEAL, you name it, was here. I was bringing up the
[2:08:29.960 --> 2:08:33.240]  fact that you look like Chuck Norris. He said, yeah, I get it all the time, but we're
[2:08:33.240 --> 2:08:36.840]  talking about on his Rhino Wars, this particular photo from Animal Planet. People
[2:08:36.840 --> 2:08:39.800]  think it's Chuck Norris. It's kind of like, I guess, a younger, bigger Chuck Norris,
[2:08:39.800 --> 2:08:44.760]  but it's just great how culturally we're having this big effect. It's exciting.
[2:08:44.760 --> 2:08:50.800]  It's an amazing time to be alive. It is, it is, and it's flattering
[2:08:50.800 --> 2:08:54.120]  for someone to tell me I look like Chuck Norris. I'm a big fan of his. I appreciate
[2:08:54.120 --> 2:08:58.760]  his patriotism and his acting work, and it's just been fun that people say,
[2:08:58.760 --> 2:09:01.600]  hey, I bet one of Chuck Norris knows that you're out there. You look like
[2:09:01.600 --> 2:09:07.360]  him a little bit. I'm like, I don't know. I bet Chuck loves the veterans,
[2:09:07.360 --> 2:09:10.880]  especially. Yeah, I'd love to meet him sometime. I think that'd be a hoot. That'd
[2:09:10.880 --> 2:09:15.320]  be a kick. Well, I was, you know, Oklahoma used to be part of Texas before they
[2:09:15.320 --> 2:09:19.320]  cut it in two. So he's actually a Texan. He lives in Texas now, but Oklahoma's
[2:09:19.320 --> 2:09:22.920]  kind of like North Texas. Well, after Walker, Texas Ranger, any like an honorary
[2:09:22.920 --> 2:09:26.480]  Texan? He absolutely is. And of course, your background's Texas as well. Oh, yeah,
[2:09:26.480 --> 2:09:29.800]  yeah. My great, great, great grandfather was second governor of Texas. Why do they
[2:09:29.800 --> 2:09:33.360]  say there's predominantly more Texans like in special operations on the groups?
[2:09:33.360 --> 2:09:36.640]  I think it's the culture here. You know, people say, what's in the water down there?
[2:09:36.640 --> 2:09:41.040]  But, you know, if you look at Marcus Latrell, Chris Kyle, myself and others,
[2:09:41.040 --> 2:09:44.920]  you know, particularly Navy SEAL snipers seem like they're all come from, a lot of
[2:09:44.920 --> 2:09:48.600]  them come from Texas. I don't know. It's just we grew up hunting, fishing, playing
[2:09:48.600 --> 2:09:52.600]  football, you know, playing in the woods and doing all the things that give us a
[2:09:52.600 --> 2:09:57.120]  head start at Navy SEAL culture. Also, if you look at what's happening in the United States,
[2:09:57.120 --> 2:10:02.080]  all the big giant Indian wars and the civil wars were constant. Like it was,
[2:10:02.080 --> 2:10:06.320]  they sent the big vanguard into Texas. And so like the best of the best, the
[2:10:06.320 --> 2:10:09.920]  whole frontiers, Navy Crockett, all of it, sent to Texas. I think it's that. Yeah.
[2:10:09.920 --> 2:10:13.280]  Well, there's a lot of heritage, man. We have Go Texan Day. Those all the Scots,
[2:10:13.280 --> 2:10:17.040]  the Irish and the English and all the baddest of the bad came into Texas.
[2:10:17.040 --> 2:10:22.880]  Those are the genetic things. We like to celebrate that. So I remember
[2:10:22.880 --> 2:10:26.040]  putting on my whole cowboy uniform to go to school and elementary school on Go
[2:10:26.040 --> 2:10:29.880]  Texan Day and celebrate all things. I used to hear all the Texas stuff,
[2:10:29.880 --> 2:10:32.360]  I get sick of hearing about it. I thought it was around more of the world and saw
[2:10:32.360 --> 2:10:36.080]  Texas is good. Just because on average, real Texans won't screw you over in
[2:10:36.080 --> 2:10:39.520]  business. You know, it's still law in Texas handshake deals or handshakes. Yeah,
[2:10:39.520 --> 2:10:42.720]  man, you got to be a man of your word. That's that's prevalent here. And I'm
[2:10:42.720 --> 2:10:46.160]  proud of that. You know, I wish that was that was more the case elsewhere. I
[2:10:46.160 --> 2:10:50.800]  really do. Again, the website for folks, amazing website, amazing information.
[2:10:50.800 --> 2:10:55.840]  Again, folks, website tacticalinsider.com. And I would like for people to also hit
[2:10:55.840 --> 2:10:59.400]  counterpoaching.com. That's the International Coalition Against
[2:10:59.400 --> 2:11:03.920]  Poaching. That's our counterpoacher operations, non-profit org to save the
[2:11:03.920 --> 2:11:06.680]  last of the endangered rhinos. And in the 15 minute piece for the news, get into
[2:11:06.680 --> 2:11:09.560]  your sources and the pedophile rings that Trump's already rolling up by the
[2:11:09.560 --> 2:11:13.800]  thousands where that's going and then talk about the poaching and how you got
[2:11:13.800 --> 2:11:17.720]  censored for the Natalie news. I'll air it tomorrow as well because that's a whole
[2:11:17.720 --> 2:11:21.920]  another area like you're on Facebook. Like you said, 90% now is being dialed back
[2:11:21.920 --> 2:11:25.560]  when you're the leading guy, admittedly actually getting stuff done to stop the
[2:11:25.560 --> 2:11:30.360]  poaching. Yeah, it's frustrating to have a bunch of veterans with a non-profit
[2:11:30.360 --> 2:11:34.600]  org looking to save the last of the endangered rhinos over in Africa and
[2:11:34.600 --> 2:11:39.840]  having Facebook crush our reach and have nobody be able to see it. I just don't
[2:11:39.840 --> 2:11:42.560]  understand what the motivation of that would be. That's ugly. Greg, you're
[2:11:42.560 --> 2:11:45.640]  awesome. God bless you for coming in. Thank you, Alex. All right. Thank you so
[2:11:45.640 --> 2:11:48.160]  much, brother. I'll see you right after the show and we'll take some right now.
[2:11:48.160 --> 2:11:51.160]  Are we going to James O'Keefe and Colonel Schaefer? We were just talking about a
[2:11:51.160 --> 2:11:54.400]  dinner last night. Great guy. I was going to be joining us. What a
[2:11:54.400 --> 2:11:57.120]  patriot behind the scenes. Believe me, folks, you have no idea. So much great
[2:11:57.120 --> 2:12:01.360]  stuff we do to defeat globalists. It's Colonel Schaefer over and over again.
[2:12:01.360 --> 2:12:05.000]  The enemy knows that. We're not telling any secrets, but to absolutely thank you,
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:09.120]  brother. So there goes Greg Sorter. I want to thank James O'Keefe for joining us
[2:12:09.120 --> 2:12:12.880]  at projectveritas.com. He's being censored. He's been blocked. We don't just bitch
[2:12:12.880 --> 2:12:16.440]  about it. The point is, we're having a big effect. The guy that brought down Acorn,
[2:12:16.440 --> 2:12:20.600]  the guy that exposed the illegals voting, to prove Trump right, the guy that
[2:12:20.600 --> 2:12:24.000]  exposed what Hillary was up to, the true game changer, joins us to the bottom of
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:28.320]  the hour. James O'Keefe, projectveritas.com. We've got some videos on your site.
[2:12:28.320 --> 2:12:31.040]  They're breaking today. Thanks for joining us to talk about the latest
[2:12:31.040 --> 2:12:34.960]  developments. Thanks, Alex, for having me. You got the floor, my friend. Wow. Where
[2:12:34.960 --> 2:12:38.920]  to start with what projectveritas was up to? Well, we just released a story
[2:12:38.920 --> 2:12:44.400]  yesterday. The head attorney for the New York Teachers' Unions is caught on video
[2:12:44.400 --> 2:12:48.760]  bragging about, this is the attorney for this teachers' union, bragging about how
[2:12:48.760 --> 2:12:55.000]  he defended a teacher who raped a child. There he is, Mitchell Rubenstein, top
[2:12:55.000 --> 2:12:58.880]  attorney for this teachers' unions in New York, putting a knife to the kid's head
[2:12:58.880 --> 2:13:02.960]  and forcing the child to perform oral sex on the teacher. Now, this was all done
[2:13:02.960 --> 2:13:08.200]  under seal. No one found out about it. He's bragging about it to, in his words,
[2:13:08.200 --> 2:13:13.440]  quote, impress a girl. It's the comment that he has given us now about, I don't
[2:13:13.440 --> 2:13:17.560]  know how you impress women by bragging about child rape. But the point of this
[2:13:17.560 --> 2:13:22.760]  video is to show that the union is out of touch, out of control with the
[2:13:22.760 --> 2:13:26.000]  American people. And now we have Betsy DeVos as the education secretary. She's
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:29.760]  being attacked. She's under assault. She claims she doesn't like children. But here
[2:13:29.760 --> 2:13:32.960]  we have a case where we have one of these top lawyers violating privilege,
[2:13:32.960 --> 2:13:37.920]  breaking the law, leaking sexual details of a rape where the teacher was not
[2:13:37.920 --> 2:13:44.320]  charged. And he wasn't charged because we think the union protects not kids, but
[2:13:44.320 --> 2:13:48.000]  they protect bad teachers. And this video is breaking and we're getting some
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:53.120]  reactions. And it may even prompt this lawyer to resign. It's the craziness,
[2:13:53.120 --> 2:13:59.040]  though, that it's like Hillary famously was mainly some of the represented
[2:13:59.040 --> 2:14:02.920]  pedophiles, child rapists, you name it. Then she made jokes about it. It's this
[2:14:02.920 --> 2:14:07.440]  underbelly that we continue to see come out over and over again of predatory
[2:14:07.440 --> 2:14:12.000]  activity. That's right. I mean, this is another example of that. I mean, I'm
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:16.520]  very passionate about education reform and reforming our schools. And this is
[2:14:16.520 --> 2:14:20.280]  something that we've seen. We never really get to really get to see the raw
[2:14:20.280 --> 2:14:25.760]  brutal reality of it. And we see rubber rooms. We see problems in the education
[2:14:25.760 --> 2:14:30.080]  system. We see Betsy DeVos attacked, viciously attacked for wanting to reform
[2:14:30.080 --> 2:14:33.480]  the system. She says she doesn't like children. But then when you actually see
[2:14:33.480 --> 2:14:37.160]  the system operates, and we've done a story last year, Alex, I was on your show
[2:14:37.160 --> 2:14:42.360]  to talk about other New York teachers, New York union officials, and the
[2:14:42.360 --> 2:14:45.640]  things they were saying, they were telling child molesters to lie about
[2:14:45.640 --> 2:14:49.080]  what they were doing. They were encouraging people to lie. And they
[2:14:49.080 --> 2:14:51.240]  faced charges, but they're not even forced to resign.
[2:14:51.240 --> 2:14:55.160]  Well, remember your first mega hit, Blowing Up Acorn? You'd go in multiple
[2:14:55.160 --> 2:14:59.080]  facilities and say, I've got child sex slaves. They all let us help you cover
[2:14:59.080 --> 2:15:03.480]  that up. I mean, it's just like a part of business. These people are so slimy.
[2:15:03.480 --> 2:15:08.360]  Yeah, they were saying to use the underage child sex slave as dependence
[2:15:08.360 --> 2:15:12.080]  on your tax returns. Since we're talking about tax returns today, they were
[2:15:12.080 --> 2:15:17.400]  telling me how to use these 13 El Salvadorian sex slaves as dependence
[2:15:17.400 --> 2:15:21.960]  to call their prostitution business performing arts on the tax return. But
[2:15:21.960 --> 2:15:27.480]  this video is, we just called Alex, this guy's boss, the head legal
[2:15:27.480 --> 2:15:30.320]  department for the entire state of New York. And he would not give us any
[2:15:30.320 --> 2:15:33.880]  information. All this stuff is happening behind the scenes. And are the rights
[2:15:33.880 --> 2:15:38.120]  of the teachers union members so absolute that they supersede the rights
[2:15:38.120 --> 2:15:42.560]  of a child not to be forced to give oral sex to a teacher? Are the teachers
[2:15:42.560 --> 2:15:45.840]  unions so out of touch and so out of control? I mean, it seems like they've
[2:15:45.840 --> 2:15:51.040]  lost their minds as well as their souls. They just have no regard for the
[2:15:51.040 --> 2:15:55.800]  welfare of children. And if you dare question them, if you
[2:15:55.800 --> 2:15:58.920]  investigate, if you do any of this, you're viciously attacked.
[2:15:58.920 --> 2:16:02.560]  Well, just earlier this month, Chris Cuomo on seeing an incident that if your
[2:16:02.560 --> 2:16:07.000]  daughter in a school sees a man in the showers of the bathroom with his
[2:16:07.000 --> 2:16:11.480]  genitalia, that she's not being open. She should accept that. So it seems like
[2:16:11.480 --> 2:16:15.160]  they've got a weird agenda they're pushing. Yeah, they are. They are pushing
[2:16:15.160 --> 2:16:18.560]  a weird agenda, but it's about power. It has nothing to do with children. It's
[2:16:18.560 --> 2:16:22.760]  about power and control and not letting people. I mean, this is all
[2:16:22.760 --> 2:16:27.200]  adjudicated behind closed doors under seal. They say, we're not going to give
[2:16:27.200 --> 2:16:30.080]  any comment about this matter. Well, what's your comment about breaking
[2:16:30.080 --> 2:16:33.560]  privilege? That attorney you just saw a moment ago, Richard Rubinstein, is
[2:16:33.560 --> 2:16:37.520]  bragging about the details of these cases. Like, well, I always defend the
[2:16:37.520 --> 2:16:41.240]  teacher. I got him off. I got him off. He, the Mitchell Rubinstein says that
[2:16:41.240 --> 2:16:46.720]  the teacher passed a lie detector test when he talked about this sex.
[2:16:46.720 --> 2:16:50.800]  And psychologically, he was thinking the child consented to it. It's sick,
[2:16:50.800 --> 2:16:55.920]  twisted, twisted. Children can't consent to sex. They're not the age of
[2:16:55.920 --> 2:17:01.120]  consent. I know it's, it's, no, no, you know, I'm just, I'm, it's, it's, it, the
[2:17:01.120 --> 2:17:04.400]  whole thing is, is disturbing. I was on the hand of these radios show
[2:17:04.400 --> 2:17:08.240]  yesterday and they had to bleep out half of the recording because you couldn't
[2:17:08.240 --> 2:17:11.400]  even say some of this stuff. So if you're going to watch this video, fasten your
[2:17:11.400 --> 2:17:14.960]  seatbelts. That's why we're not playing the video. It's just disgusting. It is
[2:17:14.960 --> 2:17:18.400]  disgusting, but it is what happens. This is what happened. Yeah, we don't,
[2:17:18.400 --> 2:17:20.880]  exactly. We don't want to be discussing. We have to report the trip. It's on,
[2:17:20.880 --> 2:17:24.360]  it's on project veritas.com. It's on infowars.com. We wrote an article about
[2:17:24.360 --> 2:17:27.560]  it with Shepherd Ambulance. Project Veritas exposes attorney who helped
[2:17:27.560 --> 2:17:32.680]  pedophile teacher get away with raping students at night point. I mean, it's
[2:17:32.680 --> 2:17:38.160]  just, it, they're so disconnected though. Like, I don't, I just don't know what to
[2:17:38.160 --> 2:17:42.040]  do at this point. Yeah, it's, it's, it's very graphic, Alex. Some, some of this
[2:17:42.040 --> 2:17:46.440]  stuff kind of speaks for itself. There really isn't much to say except we need
[2:17:46.440 --> 2:17:49.600]  to expose many, many more of these. And Alex, I did want to say one thing on your
[2:17:49.600 --> 2:17:53.920]  program today. Veritas is, we've got a number of undercover journalists. We're
[2:17:53.920 --> 2:17:59.120]  hiring a dozen more undercover reporters. And I, I'm saying this on your show
[2:17:59.120 --> 2:18:02.640]  because a lot of the people that watch your show have applied to be journalists.
[2:18:02.640 --> 2:18:06.760]  One or two of our journalists are, are here because of your show. And if you
[2:18:06.760 --> 2:18:10.360]  are interested in doing this, it's not for everyone. But if you see that type of
[2:18:10.360 --> 2:18:14.480]  stuff and you want to go out there and do it, I will pay you recruiting at
[2:18:14.480 --> 2:18:19.640]  project veritas.com to be sort of undercover agents, undercover investigative
[2:18:19.640 --> 2:18:24.360]  reporters, recruiting at project veritas.com, send us your resume, send us a
[2:18:24.360 --> 2:18:27.600]  cover letter with why you want to do this. And I will, I'm hiring more people to
[2:18:27.600 --> 2:18:30.880]  do this, Alex, because there are a thousand more cases like that.
[2:18:30.880 --> 2:18:34.600]  Exactly. There's so many, it's like you got one, you know, batter and they got a
[2:18:34.600 --> 2:18:38.360]  ball machine shooting a ball every half second. We need more people to be able to,
[2:18:38.360 --> 2:18:41.760]  you know, go after this. And absolutely, our listeners are great activists. They
[2:18:41.760 --> 2:18:45.160]  should contact you, they should get involved because it's just an incredible
[2:18:45.160 --> 2:18:48.480]  time to be alive. You know, since you mentioned it, what do you make of Maddow
[2:18:48.480 --> 2:18:51.600]  on these tax returns and how it blew up in her face? It seems like everything they
[2:18:51.600 --> 2:18:55.560]  do blows up in their face now. Yeah, I think she over, she definitely overhyped
[2:18:55.560 --> 2:19:00.080]  the story. I saw that. And when, when your own side, when the mainstream media
[2:19:00.080 --> 2:19:03.840]  even thinks that you've gone too far, you really have a problem. So I think she
[2:19:03.840 --> 2:19:07.920]  realizes she went too far. I mean, she's, she, she, on the program last night, she
[2:19:07.920 --> 2:19:10.960]  actually held the documents and said, this is it, this is all I got. There's a
[2:19:10.960 --> 2:19:17.880]  total lack of self-awareness. But I, I, I am so beyond, I am so beyond even
[2:19:17.880 --> 2:19:22.040]  worrying about these people anymore. I think that we are at the tipping point
[2:19:22.040 --> 2:19:26.240]  where as long as we do the reporting ourselves and don't care that they, they'll
[2:19:26.240 --> 2:19:29.760]  be forced to cover it. That the people are the power of the people on social
[2:19:29.760 --> 2:19:33.960]  media is much bigger than what they have. One more second. I want to get into
[2:19:33.960 --> 2:19:37.160]  that because look, when bright markets censor, we talk about, they try to put
[2:19:37.160 --> 2:19:41.040]  you in jail, we cover it. We need everybody out there to know info wars on
[2:19:41.040 --> 2:19:43.960]  Twitter, Facebook, you name it. I don't happen to you too. They're just blocking us
[2:19:43.960 --> 2:19:47.840]  admitting it as Modo celebrating it. I mean, main like Senator Rand Paul comes on
[2:19:47.840 --> 2:19:51.400]  they block it and say it's fake news. It's like a 50-minute interview with Senator.
[2:19:51.400 --> 2:19:54.800]  I mean, it's because we're criticized in the health bill. They don't want that out
[2:19:54.800 --> 2:20:00.280]  there. So, I mean, what do we do about the censorship? We'll be back.
[2:20:00.280 --> 2:20:05.520]  If you know the value of good machines, then it's high time we got together. We're

[2:21:34.480 --> 2:21:39.360]  pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries. It can also work on
[2:21:39.360 --> 2:21:43.800]  balancing the circulation for diabetics. So, the body is an amazing thing. It
[2:21:43.800 --> 2:21:47.440]  simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself. Heart and Body

[2:23:28.400 --> 2:23:32.440]  cleaning up Washington but the media and Barack Obama want to stop him. They've
[2:23:32.440 --> 2:23:37.560]  declared total war against him. Now David Horowitz's big agenda reveals Obama's
[2:23:37.560 --> 2:23:42.420]  secret plan to destroy Trump. Rush Limbaugh says you must read Big Agenda.
[2:23:42.420 --> 2:23:47.000]  Newsmax calls it the best Trump book yet. Get Big Agenda a number one best

[2:24:05.360 --> 2:24:09.640]  prison. They call him a criminal in the news for just simply covering what these
[2:24:09.640 --> 2:24:14.160]  other grips are doing. And now they're after Info Wars. The censorship is
[2:24:14.160 --> 2:24:17.120]  intensifying even though they're losing the culture war. Not to share but all of
[2:24:17.120 --> 2:24:21.640]  the world. Globalisms in trouble. Liberalisms in trouble. But they don't
[2:24:21.640 --> 2:24:26.200]  care. They're accelerating. So James O'Keefe, ProjectVeritas.com. The time we
[2:24:26.200 --> 2:24:29.760]  have, what do you make of the landscape right now? Where Trump's going? I agree
[2:24:29.760 --> 2:24:33.960]  with you, we're winning. But man, they are really trying to block our listeners.
[2:24:33.960 --> 2:24:37.880]  Forget our own Facebooks or Twitters. They're keeping our listeners from
[2:24:37.880 --> 2:24:40.720]  sharing this to their own friends and family on these platforms. This is
[2:24:40.720 --> 2:24:44.200]  outrageous. I mean, if Venezuela or Russia was doing this, it'd be a big
[2:24:44.200 --> 2:24:48.680]  deal. But oh, it's okay because they're liberal. Alex, that's a great, great point.
[2:24:48.680 --> 2:24:53.000]  I get asked every day. I get tweets and Facebook messages. James, I can't
[2:24:53.000 --> 2:24:56.640]  follow your story because YouTube won't let me subscribe to you. This is what's
[2:24:56.640 --> 2:25:00.200]  happening right now. This is what they're doing. These engineers at these social
[2:25:00.200 --> 2:25:03.680]  media companies are adjusting their algorithms. They're making it so that
[2:25:03.680 --> 2:25:07.640]  you don't get notifications if you follow you or me. This is the constant
[2:25:07.640 --> 2:25:11.680]  flurry of messages I get. Someone, some individual or series of individuals in
[2:25:11.680 --> 2:25:16.280]  these media corporations, especially in the social media companies, are
[2:25:16.280 --> 2:25:21.120]  tinkering, modifying, and breaking their own policies by banning people like you
[2:25:21.120 --> 2:25:25.280]  and I or censoring us and how to follow us. So what is the answer to that
[2:25:25.280 --> 2:25:29.560]  problem since social media we depend upon? Here's the answer. Veritas has to
[2:25:29.560 --> 2:25:34.080]  investigate and target those people and catch them on tape in the act. That's
[2:25:34.080 --> 2:25:36.920]  what I was thinking next. Now it's time to infiltrate Google, Facebook, and
[2:25:36.920 --> 2:25:40.320]  Twitter. That's exactly what I, you know, I gotta be careful about broadcasting
[2:25:40.320 --> 2:25:46.040]  exactly what I'm gonna do. But mark my words that we are trying to catch those
[2:25:46.040 --> 2:25:50.400]  people on tape. There's thousands of them. Well, hell, Facebook admits they
[2:25:50.400 --> 2:25:53.560]  censor conservatives. Well, it's one thing to admit it. It's another thing to
[2:25:53.560 --> 2:25:56.760]  get them in the act doing it. Sure. Making fun of it. Say, oh, I want to ban
[2:25:56.760 --> 2:26:00.320]  Alex Jones today. Let's take him out. Let's take this guy out. If you do that,
[2:26:00.320 --> 2:26:03.880]  if we can catch. No, you got Roger Stone. They go, oh, look, we banned him.
[2:26:03.880 --> 2:26:08.480]  Ha, ha, ha. You have it on tape. Yes, we want to ban Veritas. Ha, ha, ha. That's
[2:26:08.480 --> 2:26:11.600]  exactly, and we want to, we want to expose exactly how they do it. And they are
[2:26:11.600 --> 2:26:16.240]  private companies, but they yield monopolies and they have a public. They're wide
[2:26:16.240 --> 2:26:19.960]  open. They're far away. And it's false advertising. They act like they're free
[2:26:19.960 --> 2:26:23.560]  and open. They're not. No, they're not free and open. So the solution in my
[2:26:23.560 --> 2:26:27.480]  opinion is not an easy answer. It's not whatever wants to hear. We got to catch
[2:26:27.480 --> 2:26:32.120]  these guys in the act of banning people and censoring them. Social media, in my
[2:26:32.120 --> 2:26:37.240]  opinion, I think your opinion too, has become more powerful than the mainstream.
[2:26:37.240 --> 2:26:41.000]  Oh, absolutely. But the social media companies are governed by people who are
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:46.440]  fundamentally opposed to our Republican and how we operate. So we have to
[2:26:46.440 --> 2:26:50.360]  expose them in the act. I agree. What do you make of the arrogance though? This
[2:26:50.360 --> 2:26:54.320]  never works out well. They're doing it still in a quasi-free society. It's
[2:26:54.320 --> 2:26:57.560]  blowing up in their face. Don't they get that this isn't going to work? No,
[2:26:57.560 --> 2:27:00.360]  because they've never, just like the teachers union, they've never been held
[2:27:00.360 --> 2:27:04.240]  accountable in their entire lives. Everyone's sucking up to them. They have
[2:27:04.240 --> 2:27:07.400]  lobbyists. They are close to those in government. They've never been held
[2:27:07.400 --> 2:27:10.880]  accountable. They never had a difficult question be answered of them, because
[2:27:10.880 --> 2:27:13.640]  everyone wants something from them. So that's why you need people who are
[2:27:13.640 --> 2:27:17.400]  unafraid and you're afraid of retaliation. Well, I'll take the
[2:27:17.400 --> 2:27:21.120]  arrows. I will take the abuse. I'll take the lawsuits. I got sued by a woman
[2:27:21.120 --> 2:27:25.560]  within Common Core last week from a video I did a year ago that was on your
[2:27:25.560 --> 2:27:29.760]  show. She sued me and I just go public with the information. I just tell the
[2:27:29.760 --> 2:27:34.280]  people what they're doing. We have to go after these people. We have to expose
[2:27:34.280 --> 2:27:39.120]  them and it's not easy. But that's why I was about to say though, this isn't a call
[2:27:39.120 --> 2:27:42.560]  for help. We're your champions. We're on the battlefield. Project Veritas
[2:27:42.560 --> 2:27:47.240]  Info Wars, sponsorships, donations to Veritas, buy our products. I mean, I don't
[2:27:47.240 --> 2:27:49.400]  want to even get into the inside baseball behind the scenes, but the same
[2:27:49.400 --> 2:27:53.880]  stuff O'Keeffe goes through. It's a war, okay? I mean, you name it. It's being
[2:27:53.880 --> 2:27:57.480]  done and I'm not bitching. I know I'm in a war with scum. I expect to just know
[2:27:57.480 --> 2:28:01.520]  this. This isn't entertainment. This isn't a game. We need your financial support.
[2:28:01.520 --> 2:28:05.120]  Spread our links. Spread our articles as well, because they're trying to block them
[2:28:05.120 --> 2:28:10.520]  because they're powerful. That's right. And Alex, again, the other thing we
[2:28:10.520 --> 2:28:15.200]  need other than donations is a specific type of undercover reporting.
[2:28:15.200 --> 2:28:20.200]  Volunteers, soldiers. Volunteers. I'll pay. I'm hiring journalists. Recruiting at
[2:28:20.200 --> 2:28:25.040]  projectveritas.com. If you think, you know what? I want to go inside of Google and I
[2:28:25.040 --> 2:28:28.040]  want to catch their people. That's an idea. We should just call for people that
[2:28:28.040 --> 2:28:31.960]  are already inside. They want to be patriots. Contact you. I mean, hell,
[2:28:31.960 --> 2:28:34.160]  you're the one. That's another thing that's happening. Alex, that's another thing.
[2:28:34.160 --> 2:28:37.720]  Ever since we announced the CNN story, we've had people inside of these media companies
[2:28:37.720 --> 2:28:42.440]  who are contacting me. The problem is they, so like, I can't say who I'm working with,
[2:28:42.440 --> 2:28:47.400]  but they don't want to wear a wire or record them because they would get burned. So I have
[2:28:47.400 --> 2:28:51.280]  to, they'll tell me where the bodies are buried. They'll tell James, go talk to the
[2:28:51.280 --> 2:28:54.960]  vice president. His name is Smith. He, he's the one breaking the law. So I got, I got
[2:28:54.960 --> 2:28:59.920]  to take a journalist going there because I can't burn the people that contact.
[2:28:59.920 --> 2:29:02.880]  They're giving you leads and you've got to follow them up.
[2:29:02.880 --> 2:29:06.560]  That's it. Yeah, that's exactly right. And it's hard work and you're doing a great
[2:29:06.560 --> 2:29:10.080]  job and we're so blessed to have you there and your whole team. Project Veritas.com.
[2:29:10.080 --> 2:29:14.640]  James O'Keefe. Thanks for joining us, buddy. Thanks, Alex. Thank you. Yeah. I mean, folks,
[2:29:14.640 --> 2:29:17.400]  you want somebody to fight for the country. I'm not bragging. We're doing it. He's doing
[2:29:17.400 --> 2:29:22.680]  it. We're, this isn't a game. I mean, this is war. We've got the truth. They've got
[2:29:22.680 --> 2:29:27.080]  lies and you keep us afloat with your prayers and your financial support and spreading those
[2:29:27.080 --> 2:29:34.040]  articles and links. Cause look, I want one thing in this fight and that's to beat these
[2:29:34.040 --> 2:29:40.240]  scum because they're trash. They want us to be poor and dumb. I want us to be successful.
[2:29:40.240 --> 2:29:44.400]  So do you. We're going to beat them together. We're going to win. We're going to build the
[2:29:44.400 --> 2:29:48.680]  world for our children. Colonel Schaefer straight ahead.
[2:29:48.680 --> 2:30:00.200]  Here on the March, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Well,
[2:30:00.200 --> 2:30:05.760]  it looks like even the establishment mainstream media has to admit that Rachel Maddow's Trump
[2:30:05.760 --> 2:30:12.720]  tax scandal is a big nothing burger. If all we get tonight is that Donald Trump paid $38
[2:30:12.720 --> 2:30:17.120]  million to America's government. That's a good night for Donald Trump. I'm sorry. There's
[2:30:17.120 --> 2:30:21.920]  just really no way. I was hoping and praying that it would show. Not only did he pay no
[2:30:21.920 --> 2:30:26.280]  taxes, he actually charged the government and got money back. Sorry to disappoint you,
[2:30:26.280 --> 2:30:31.640]  Van Jones, but what you liberals thought was going to be a huge Trump scandal ended up
[2:30:31.640 --> 2:30:37.720]  being a big boost to President Donald Trump's reputation as a successful, hardworking American
[2:30:37.720 --> 2:30:42.680]  and tax paying businessman. And now we know that Trump actually paid a high tax rate of
[2:30:42.680 --> 2:30:50.040]  roughly 25%. Compare that to MSNBC's parent company Comcast, which paid 24%, Barack Obama,
[2:30:50.040 --> 2:30:56.400]  19% and Bernie Sanders, who only paid 18% in taxes. Read them and weep snowflakes and

[2:33:09.500 --> 2:33:22.900]  Well, we've had a lot of amazing guests and whistleblowers and insiders on over the years.
[2:33:22.900 --> 2:33:29.900]  It's gotta be at least 13, 14 years I've been having Lieutenant Colonel Tony Schaefer
[2:33:29.900 --> 2:33:35.140]  on who headed up Able, Danger, Stratocivy programs that could've killed bin Laden, could've
[2:33:35.140 --> 2:33:39.260]  rolled up Al Qaeda. The U.S. Army was on them. It's come out in Congress. They were ordered
[2:33:39.260 --> 2:33:46.260]  to stand down. But since then, Benghazi and Russiagate and all of it, I mean, Schaefer
[2:33:46.260 --> 2:33:50.860]  has, I'm not kissing his butt, it's just true, has been so on target and first, over and
[2:33:50.860 --> 2:33:55.620]  over again. And obviously, he works with a lot of international and clandestine groups
[2:33:55.620 --> 2:33:58.340]  that are for sovereignty and freedom. He can't get into all those details, but he's joining
[2:33:58.340 --> 2:34:02.480]  us via video Skype for just one segment. He's a Fox contributor and so much more, London
[2:34:02.480 --> 2:34:07.220]  Center.org, Tony-Schaefer.com, written a whole bunch of bestselling books that everybody
[2:34:07.220 --> 2:34:08.220]  should read.
[2:34:08.220 --> 2:34:14.900]  But I want to hit Deep State, Russia, obviously the same topics he wants to get into and where
[2:34:14.900 --> 2:34:19.100]  the state of this country is. I mean, how can anybody deny that from trying to cut taxes,
[2:34:19.100 --> 2:34:24.540]  restore the Republic basic sovereignty, rebuild our military, but from an insider, a true patriot
[2:34:24.540 --> 2:34:29.380]  who's been in the deep state, exposing it is Colonel Schaefer. They act like Spicers
[2:34:29.380 --> 2:34:33.580]  Crazy saying, of course, there's a deep state of leftist and foundation people that are
[2:34:33.580 --> 2:34:38.020]  openly refusing the president's orders that are lawful. They act like when he fires 46
[2:34:38.020 --> 2:34:42.820]  U.S. attorneys, that's weird. Clinton fired 93. So Colonel Schaefer joins us. Always great
[2:34:42.820 --> 2:34:43.820]  to have you on, sir.
[2:34:43.820 --> 2:34:46.300]  Good to have you be on. Thanks for having me.
[2:34:46.300 --> 2:34:50.820]  Well, the 15 minutes we've got, you've got the floor. Let's get the intel data dump from
[2:34:50.820 --> 2:34:51.820]  Colonel Schaefer.
[2:34:51.820 --> 2:34:56.620]  Well, first, I think your point is well taken. Look, we have to understand that this this
[2:34:56.620 --> 2:35:01.620]  town of Washington runs on momentum. That momentum is driven by what we know to be the
[2:35:01.620 --> 2:35:06.180]  bureaucracy. And I've said this in several interviews. If anyone who denies a deep state
[2:35:06.180 --> 2:35:11.140]  denies the very existence of the U.S. government, the bureaucracy, the elements which consist
[2:35:11.140 --> 2:35:15.020]  of the bureaucracy, all these small things make up big things. And I think the ultimate
[2:35:15.020 --> 2:35:20.140]  example to help your audience understand why there's a deep state is lowest learner. Lowest
[2:35:20.140 --> 2:35:25.940]  learners simply put was a Clinton appointee who decided that she wanted to become part
[2:35:25.940 --> 2:35:31.380]  of the bureaucracy permanently. And then over the years, Alex, she got moved around.
[2:35:31.380 --> 2:35:36.020]  She ended up at the IRS as a career person. Well, she never really changed her color.
[2:35:36.020 --> 2:35:41.820]  She was always a partisan. She was always a Democrat cut from the cloth of the Clintons.
[2:35:41.820 --> 2:35:47.460]  And she simply burrowed her way in like a tick. And so this is why there are people out there
[2:35:47.460 --> 2:35:52.060]  who are all throughout the bureaucracies consisting of the deep state. It is what it is. And let
[2:35:52.060 --> 2:35:55.860]  me point this out for the audience understand as well, is that they tend to forget that
[2:35:55.860 --> 2:36:00.860]  the deep state won against Barack Obama on something called Gitmo, Guantanamo Bay. The
[2:36:00.860 --> 2:36:06.700]  deep state, those who are against the idea of causing causing Gitmo, the Pentagon, bought
[2:36:06.700 --> 2:36:11.300]  tooth and nail and still open. So as much as, you know, people want to say it doesn't
[2:36:11.300 --> 2:36:15.860]  exist. If you just look around, you just think for yourself, look at the evidence, you know
[2:36:15.860 --> 2:36:21.300]  what exists. What I think is more sinister, obviously, is that now you have a resistance
[2:36:21.300 --> 2:36:25.740]  movement built within it. And I do believe, Alex, for all the reasons that we've talked
[2:36:25.740 --> 2:36:29.500]  about in the past. And as a matter of fact, last time we talked was on the eve of the
[2:36:29.500 --> 2:36:35.020]  election, all the things which existed, we talked about them regarding why you predicted
[2:36:35.020 --> 2:36:39.100]  a Trump victory, I should add. It did. We were together on that. Yes. And I felt very
[2:36:39.100 --> 2:36:43.740]  strong about the fact that should he win and he did, he's going to have a lot of work
[2:36:43.740 --> 2:36:48.380]  to cut out all of the cancer that the Obama folks put into the government. And that's
[2:36:48.380 --> 2:36:52.660]  the other part of the deep state now. It's not only, it doesn't only exist, we know it
[2:36:52.660 --> 2:36:56.980]  exists. Now it's organizing, self-organizing, if you will, to actually do a lot more, be
[2:36:56.980 --> 2:36:59.660]  a lot more effective in resistance. So that's something we all have to be concerned about.
[2:36:59.660 --> 2:37:03.940]  Well, sure. When I said you were part of the deep state, like you said, from the resistance,
[2:37:03.940 --> 2:37:08.580]  Americana, the bureaucracy, the agencies are all part of that tissue. But of course, the
[2:37:08.580 --> 2:37:13.540]  bureaucracy is where the power is now, you know, the fourth branch of government. And
[2:37:13.540 --> 2:37:19.060]  so there it is, the denial of it existing, or then making fun of Conway saying that household
[2:37:19.060 --> 2:37:24.100]  appliances can spy on you when the CIA director in Wired Magazine four years ago said that.
[2:37:24.100 --> 2:37:30.340]  It's just a crazy denial of reality. And as a point, it's like Rachel Maddow coming
[2:37:30.340 --> 2:37:34.860]  on last night and the guy she had on saying, Oh, Donald Trump must have mailed this to
[2:37:34.860 --> 2:37:39.340]  me. Really? That sounds like a conspiracy to me. All these wacky conspiracies they bring
[2:37:39.340 --> 2:37:45.020]  up with it, it's on their side. And I'm sorry, yes, the deep state has examined and Alex,
[2:37:45.020 --> 2:37:49.140]  I'm saying this for your audience because you know, they love the fact that we have these
[2:37:49.140 --> 2:37:53.380]  conversations. The fact that the CIA was disclosed to have access to all these technologies
[2:37:53.380 --> 2:37:57.420]  that can go into all of these things in our house indicates that, yes, of course, they
[2:37:57.420 --> 2:38:03.260]  can anything that has a computer chip on it, anything from a cell phone to a microwave,
[2:38:03.260 --> 2:38:08.820]  anything that has a microchip can be used for exploitation and intelligence collection.
[2:38:08.820 --> 2:38:13.180]  That's just the way it is. But if Trump's folks say it, it's conspiracy. If they say
[2:38:13.180 --> 2:38:16.660]  it, it's just well, it's well, well, good. It's completely double the complete double
[2:38:16.660 --> 2:38:17.660]  standard.
[2:38:17.660 --> 2:38:21.460]  I want you to get the points you want to cover. You know about any of this and probably anybody,
[2:38:21.460 --> 2:38:26.580]  but 55 days into his administration, other than not liking this Ryan bill, I mean, he's
[2:38:26.580 --> 2:38:31.860]  really delivering. He's got the elites. The specialists were so upset from your sources
[2:38:31.860 --> 2:38:36.700]  in DC, the Pentagon, you name it. How is Trump doing in this civil war? They're calling it
[2:38:36.700 --> 2:38:41.580]  a civil war where America is trying to reinsert itself into its proper role, the people, the
[2:38:41.580 --> 2:38:46.300]  constitutional role, the rebirth of America, like he said, January 20th. I mean, how is
[2:38:46.300 --> 2:38:47.300]  that goal going?
[2:38:47.300 --> 2:38:51.780]  Well, I can tell you that the people I talked to, I've always talked to are trying to do
[2:38:51.780 --> 2:38:55.580]  the right things, the American people, they're trying to stay out of the politics, but simply
[2:38:55.580 --> 2:38:59.980]  put in this town, Alex, everything is political. Even when you try to not be political, you
[2:38:59.980 --> 2:39:05.340]  become political. So I think what we've seen is those who wish to support Mr. Trump have
[2:39:05.340 --> 2:39:10.260]  been doing their best to do their duty, to actually be loyal to their oath of office.
[2:39:10.260 --> 2:39:14.100]  Others have decided that there's no reason to maintain an oath of office and are going
[2:39:14.100 --> 2:39:15.100]  against it.
[2:39:15.100 --> 2:39:19.980]  I think the play out of the health care thing, and by the way, I'm one of those affected
[2:39:19.980 --> 2:39:24.660]  badly by Obamacare. I actually lost the plan I was very happy with. So when I see these
[2:39:24.660 --> 2:39:32.460]  figures about the stats, the congressional estimates saying that 14 million people are
[2:39:32.460 --> 2:39:36.740]  going to lose their, well, I didn't predict, I was going to lose my health care and I did.
[2:39:36.740 --> 2:39:41.940]  So I'm with the president on this. I think the CBO has become politicized. I think clearly
[2:39:41.940 --> 2:39:47.780]  people like me and others did suffer. I talked to my congressman about this. He blew me off,
[2:39:47.780 --> 2:39:53.780]  a guy named Connolly. Just didn't want to hear it, that somehow the Obama plan didn't
[2:39:53.780 --> 2:39:57.980]  work out for me. So this is what I'm talking about regarding the fact that people who do
[2:39:57.980 --> 2:40:02.820]  see what Mr. Trump is trying to do want to sign up and help. And I think you're going
[2:40:02.820 --> 2:40:06.860]  to see the government bureaucracy, like the CBO, like other elements, do whatever they
[2:40:06.860 --> 2:40:14.780]  can to fly out and lie if they have to about what they think they need to say, whether
[2:40:14.780 --> 2:40:19.260]  it's based on fact or not. And I think it's just about undermining Mr. Trump.
[2:40:19.260 --> 2:40:25.220]  This gut level dead reckoning, Colonel Schaefer, looking at what Trump's done, where the different
[2:40:25.220 --> 2:40:28.340]  power structures are, where the Democrats are, where the Republican power structure
[2:40:28.340 --> 2:40:34.700]  is. Where do you see Trump in six months? I mean, overall, I think he's over-delivered
[2:40:34.700 --> 2:40:39.620]  many ways, but at the same time, look, I'm not looking for some military response or
[2:40:39.620 --> 2:40:44.020]  police response, but you can't have newspapers every day and Snoop Dogg and movie stars every
[2:40:44.020 --> 2:40:47.900]  day saying kill the president and trying to organize it. And we're being censored all
[2:40:47.900 --> 2:40:53.020]  over Google and Facebook and Twitter, and we're seeing, like, Gizmodo bragging, yes,
[2:40:53.020 --> 2:40:56.500]  shut off info wars, you know, basically kicking him off air. I'm seeing real authoritarian
[2:40:56.500 --> 2:41:00.980]  stuff at us, like they're the Venezuelan government or something, or the Cuban government against
[2:41:00.980 --> 2:41:05.380]  their own people. And at some point, I'm just saying, how much does Trump take of this when
[2:41:05.380 --> 2:41:07.820]  it's all clearly un-American and illegal?
[2:41:07.820 --> 2:41:12.220]  I called it Soviet level wrongdoing. That's what you see here, that the idea of Solington
[2:41:12.220 --> 2:41:15.860]  you and others is exactly what the Soviet Union would have done. And this goes to the
[2:41:15.860 --> 2:41:18.980]  deep state and the Obama administration's attitude.
[2:41:18.980 --> 2:41:22.420]  I think there's two things he has to do, Alex. First, frankly, he's got to make an example
[2:41:22.420 --> 2:41:26.660]  of someone like Loretta Lynch. Loretta Lynch, who recently came on and said that there needs
[2:41:26.660 --> 2:41:30.620]  to be blood in the streets to support the resistance. I think that's addition based
[2:41:30.620 --> 2:41:31.620]  on my reading of title.
[2:41:31.620 --> 2:41:36.780]  When you have the former attorney general, he has extra gravitas. That's like a declaration
[2:41:36.780 --> 2:41:38.540]  of war against the Republic.
[2:41:38.540 --> 2:41:43.500]  Precisely. Secondly, I think he's got to do more to weed out the deep state operatives
[2:41:43.500 --> 2:41:47.380]  on both sides. Look, I'm talking about folks in the Bush administration who were equally
[2:41:47.380 --> 2:41:49.900]  disdained by President Trump and what he's doing.
[2:41:49.900 --> 2:41:54.700]  Well, McCain, let's go back to Loretta Lynch. This is intriguing. Where has the confidence
[2:41:54.700 --> 2:42:01.420]  come from to call for major military action against the president or civil war? And then
[2:42:01.420 --> 2:42:03.900]  it's, it's, it's, and that is, that is outrageous.
[2:42:03.900 --> 2:42:07.940]  Well, and that's the issue. It's like these folks can say these sort of things with impunity
[2:42:07.940 --> 2:42:11.900]  and never be held accountable. And what I'm saying is that, look, you need to start holding
[2:42:11.900 --> 2:42:17.740]  it, people accountable for their words, especially if they, they are meant to disrupt the elected
[2:42:17.740 --> 2:42:21.500]  officials and coming into the current government. And the other thing Mr. Trump has to do Alex
[2:42:21.500 --> 2:42:25.740]  to that point, he's got to pick good people. He's got to continue to push that. We've seen
[2:42:25.740 --> 2:42:31.180]  very few appointees come in since 20 January. We see the, the, the, the principles only.
[2:42:31.180 --> 2:42:32.180]  This something needs to be fixed.
[2:42:32.180 --> 2:42:35.940]  He's only got one level in. Well, what's the word on that? Well, why is that happening?
[2:42:35.940 --> 2:42:40.820]  Well, frankly, the word is a Pentagon and a DHS and others are kind of bickering back
[2:42:40.820 --> 2:42:44.820]  and forth with the White House. The White House, I think there's some political infighting
[2:42:44.820 --> 2:42:48.660]  there going on. I don't think everybody even in the White House necessarily wants to go
[2:42:48.660 --> 2:42:53.340]  along with Mr. Trump's agenda. And I think there's some infighting from those who are,
[2:42:53.340 --> 2:42:57.860]  I would say more traditional Aneacons who are trying to do their own insinuation, I
[2:42:57.860 --> 2:43:00.780]  think. And I don't think it's good for the government that they listen to the Aneacons.
[2:43:00.780 --> 2:43:03.860]  So I think that's something that we need to consider. And then third and most important,
[2:43:03.860 --> 2:43:09.220]  I think the president has to continue to reinforce the fact that he's telling the American people
[2:43:09.220 --> 2:43:14.460]  the truth. He's trying to act in their interest. And I, frankly, things like this tax return
[2:43:14.460 --> 2:43:18.940]  thing only serve to back up, back him up and show how the mainstream media has become a
[2:43:18.940 --> 2:43:21.740]  complete circus and a complete job.
[2:43:21.740 --> 2:43:27.220]  Sure. How important is it to get veterans who are so respected who under Obama were
[2:43:27.220 --> 2:43:31.140]  just thrown to the side to cover their faces up when they said, let's not go into Syria
[2:43:31.140 --> 2:43:34.540]  be all kind of Air Force. You kind of help leave the charge exposing that with Congress
[2:43:34.540 --> 2:43:37.860]  behind the scenes. And I mean, now I think veterans and active duty as the commander
[2:43:37.860 --> 2:43:40.820]  in chief, shouldn't they all come out because they're trying to claim he's this Russian
[2:43:40.820 --> 2:43:45.580]  agent and stuff and say, no, he's America. He's making the country great. He delivered.
[2:43:45.580 --> 2:43:49.820]  And we support him to just let the, you know, liberals and others know and people that are
[2:43:49.820 --> 2:43:54.380]  on the communist Chinese payroll, you know, that's the actual foreign enemy, try to derail
[2:43:54.380 --> 2:43:55.780]  our true president.
[2:43:55.780 --> 2:43:59.700]  Right. Well, that's your point as well. We'll take it first on Syria. Yeah. Look, we've
[2:43:59.700 --> 2:44:04.060]  been backing the wrong side there the entire time. And I think a lot of folks, Senator
[2:44:04.060 --> 2:44:08.540]  Rand Paul, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, are both on the right track trying to do some
[2:44:08.540 --> 2:44:11.940]  legislation to prevent us from arming our enemies. I think it's a good idea anytime
[2:44:11.940 --> 2:44:16.340]  you look at that. And simply put, yes, you've got to look at how we've got to get the corporates
[2:44:16.340 --> 2:44:17.340]  out of the way.
[2:44:17.340 --> 2:44:21.620]  There's a foreign interest here. And that's what I find ironic, Alex, is that you can see
[2:44:21.620 --> 2:44:25.820]  foreign interest all over the place, but all of a sudden it's all about Russia. And let
[2:44:25.820 --> 2:44:28.260]  me tell you, if you actually start peeling that back, you're going to, we're going to
[2:44:28.260 --> 2:44:32.820]  find that a lot of the key Russian contacts were not with Mr. Trump, but with Ms. Clinton.
[2:44:32.820 --> 2:44:36.300]  When you look at the uranium deal, hasn't it always been the Democrats in bed with the
[2:44:36.300 --> 2:44:37.300]  Russians?
[2:44:37.300 --> 2:44:39.820]  Right. I think they are. I think they're completely in bed with the Russians. I think
[2:44:39.820 --> 2:44:44.420]  that they've always been in bed with the Russians. And the Russians, frankly, Alex, from what
[2:44:44.420 --> 2:44:49.660]  I've seen, what they had planned, what the Democrats had planned, Obama and Clinton is
[2:44:49.660 --> 2:44:55.140]  a revenge campaign against President against Mr. Trump, had he lost the election, they
[2:44:55.140 --> 2:44:59.460]  were going to try to put a stake in the heart of Mr. Trump by trying to create this whole
[2:44:59.460 --> 2:45:03.100]  fiction of the Russians being behind the campaign. I think this was going to be the
[2:45:03.100 --> 2:45:07.380]  thing to completely and permanently in his political desires, because I think they saw
[2:45:07.380 --> 2:45:08.380]  it, he would come back.
[2:45:08.380 --> 2:45:13.340]  Well, that's a great point. I mean, they have always made for TV movies where the president's
[2:45:13.340 --> 2:45:17.700]  a woman, where the right wing's fighting her, where there's a civil war, where Trump's
[2:45:17.700 --> 2:45:22.460]  a Russian. All their propaganda is overlapping as if she was still going to win. The fact
[2:45:22.460 --> 2:45:26.260]  that she didn't win when they were so confident is really why they're in such disarray.
[2:45:26.260 --> 2:45:30.340]  Precisely. But I think they're still continuing to play the plan out as best they can, because
[2:45:30.340 --> 2:45:34.340]  I think they were laying the seeds for this, Alex, going back last year to try to make
[2:45:34.340 --> 2:45:39.500]  Mr. Trump into the so-called pawn of Putin. And I don't think it could be further from
[2:45:39.500 --> 2:45:43.300]  the truth. And again, maybe clear that Pentagon and others have decided that we're not going
[2:45:43.300 --> 2:45:48.260]  to work with the Russians. We're going to examine things. I know for a fact that in
[2:45:48.260 --> 2:45:51.900]  Syria, for example, there's a decision to not work with the Russians. And what we're
[2:45:51.900 --> 2:45:55.980]  doing there is to make sure we don't kill each other by fratricide. We do coordinate,
[2:45:55.980 --> 2:46:00.860]  but we do not conduct, you know, joint special operations operations for any number of purpose
[2:46:00.860 --> 2:46:01.860]  of reasons.
[2:46:01.860 --> 2:46:07.020]  Wow. Okay. And the five minutes we have left, I want to get into a whole nother subject
[2:46:07.020 --> 2:46:11.780]  because the media has misrepresented this. We know that that former head of Blackwater,
[2:46:11.780 --> 2:46:15.900]  who's got all these huge connections, Eric Prince came out and said in Breitbart, I have
[2:46:15.900 --> 2:46:19.900]  law enforcement sources that Wiener is going to get, you know, basically indicted for
[2:46:19.900 --> 2:46:23.420]  child porn. Now they admit months later that they're looking at indicted. So Prince was
[2:46:23.420 --> 2:46:27.340]  right there. Our sources in the NYPD, two separate ones said, it's much worse, all this
[2:46:27.340 --> 2:46:28.340]  is going on.
[2:46:28.340 --> 2:46:31.420]  Then the media misrepresented it onto some pizza place and made up a bunch of stuff to
[2:46:31.420 --> 2:46:35.340]  try to distract off onto that. We're not saying anything happened to the pizza place, but
[2:46:35.340 --> 2:46:38.300]  clearly I know you have a lot of sources looking at this. We know the British government's
[2:46:38.300 --> 2:46:43.020]  been infiltrated and it's using this as blackmail. We know it went on at Penn State, other places
[2:46:43.020 --> 2:46:47.460]  that I've been told by some sources separately that you had been investigating this. You
[2:46:47.460 --> 2:46:50.380]  can correct me if I'm wrong or not, but I wanted to just get your point. We know Jerry
[2:46:50.380 --> 2:46:55.220]  Epstein is in, you know, obviously got convicted. All this stuff's going on. Bill Clinton with
[2:46:55.220 --> 2:46:58.180]  them. What can you say about that in closing?
[2:46:58.180 --> 2:47:03.540]  Well, I can say this, look, Eric, Eric Prince is a friend and I do believe his sources are
[2:47:03.540 --> 2:47:09.460]  impeccable on this issue. There's something that we've known here for a while, Alex here
[2:47:09.460 --> 2:47:14.900]  in Washington is that there are overlapping interests, which will use criminal networks
[2:47:14.900 --> 2:47:20.340]  such as the pedophiles. They will use that for political purposes. I don't know if you
[2:47:20.340 --> 2:47:25.220]  are familiar with the term brownstone. Brownstone is where you have the traditional honeypot.
[2:47:25.220 --> 2:47:29.620]  You may have a congressman, some other high government official enticed to sleep with
[2:47:29.620 --> 2:47:34.100]  a female, an attractive female, but then what that female does is takes it to another level.
[2:47:34.100 --> 2:47:37.260]  I mean, that's not good enough anymore. What they do then is try to get you in bed with
[2:47:37.260 --> 2:47:41.620]  an underage girl telling you, oh, she's only 20. And then they get you on tape. They videotape
[2:47:41.620 --> 2:47:46.860]  that and then you are theirs. So this brownstone thing is something I think has become something
[2:47:46.860 --> 2:47:53.020]  that we need to examine as a methodology that's been used, I believe, effectively to subvert
[2:47:53.020 --> 2:47:56.340]  political figures here in town. And I think there's a couple that have been known in the
[2:47:56.340 --> 2:48:01.860]  past that have functioned well. I think Barney Frank was probably one of the ones actually
[2:48:01.860 --> 2:48:05.700]  involved in this sort of thing before people understood it completely. So what I'm saying
[2:48:05.700 --> 2:48:10.740]  is that we need to examine the potential criminal relations, the relationships between terror
[2:48:10.740 --> 2:48:16.580]  organizations and criminal enterprises for purposes of trying to essentially establish
[2:48:16.580 --> 2:48:20.900]  control and access to key leaders here in Washington.
[2:48:20.900 --> 2:48:23.620]  And trust me, there's a lot of folks who are susceptible to that sort of thing here on
[2:48:23.620 --> 2:48:27.860]  Capitol Hill. I'm not, I'm a block away from Capitol Hill right now. So we have to understand
[2:48:27.860 --> 2:48:34.060]  our enemies will use whatever methodology they can to subvert our, our, our political
[2:48:34.060 --> 2:48:35.060]  process.
[2:48:35.060 --> 2:48:37.940]  And compromise. I know you got to go in two minutes. Let me ask you this. I was told by
[2:48:37.940 --> 2:48:43.540]  our sources that they were getting ready to roll up thousands of the procurers of kids
[2:48:43.540 --> 2:48:48.340]  in California, Pennsylvania, you name it, boom, Trump gets in. It's like 2,500 arrests
[2:48:48.340 --> 2:48:54.300]  now. The media though, when they find like, you know, 30 plus kids in, in cages, it'll,
[2:48:54.300 --> 2:48:57.860]  it's in the news. One time you think that'd be everywhere. You know, one kid's missing
[2:48:57.860 --> 2:49:02.260]  is all the news. It should be. So the fact that it's being covered up. And then I was
[2:49:02.260 --> 2:49:06.300]  told this without before it's like, wow, is Trump really, you know, greenlighting this?
[2:49:06.300 --> 2:49:07.300]  Thank God law enforcement.
[2:49:07.300 --> 2:49:10.580]  What was keeping law enforcement before from doing it? And I wonder how far this is going
[2:49:10.580 --> 2:49:15.580]  to go. Is that why Democrats and others are so desperate? Just in the last 60 seconds,
[2:49:15.580 --> 2:49:17.060]  any other points on that or sources?
[2:49:17.060 --> 2:49:20.860]  No, you're completely correct. I think what's, that's why you've seen law enforcement move
[2:49:20.860 --> 2:49:24.860]  forward. Be very effective. I think you're going to see more. Donald Trump has tweeted
[2:49:24.860 --> 2:49:28.660]  out on this. It's an important issue. And that's why the other side is being stated.
[2:49:28.660 --> 2:49:31.580]  Think about it. Think, why would the other side stay silent on this where it's such a
[2:49:31.580 --> 2:49:34.940]  key issue unless they have something to do with it and protecting it? And I think that's
[2:49:34.940 --> 2:49:39.500]  why you've not seen a lot of action in the Clinton White House or the Obama White House,
[2:49:39.500 --> 2:49:42.580]  because there was no interest, because I think they were part of it.
[2:49:42.580 --> 2:49:47.260]  I'm going to put your lower third back up on screen in a moment here, but 474 arrested.
[2:49:47.260 --> 2:49:50.740]  I mean, that was just months ago. This is just every day. It's happening. No coverage
[2:49:50.740 --> 2:49:54.580]  other than the first article. Then it gets shut down. I know you've written a bunch of
[2:49:54.580 --> 2:49:59.500]  bus selling books. I've read two of your books. Of course, you got a big Facebook, you name
[2:49:59.500 --> 2:50:02.620]  it, Colonel Shaffer and closing. Where's the best place for people to keep in contact
[2:50:02.620 --> 2:50:03.620]  with everything you're doing?
[2:50:03.620 --> 2:50:08.340]  Just follow me on Twitter, T Spooky. I think a lot of your folks, your, your friends already
[2:50:08.340 --> 2:50:13.620]  follow me. And I think, I know you and I follow each other. And then Facebook, Anthony Shaffer
[2:50:13.620 --> 2:50:18.220]  and then Tony underscore Shaffer.com is my website. And I work for the London Center
[2:50:18.220 --> 2:50:22.060]  for Policy Research London Center.org. And so you can keep track of everything we're
[2:50:22.060 --> 2:50:23.060]  up to.
[2:50:23.060 --> 2:50:25.860]  Sure. Well, I respected what you were doing in Congress and exposing all the stuff of
[2:50:25.860 --> 2:50:29.180]  Saudi Arabia 15 years ago, but then getting to know you and just seeing at the center
[2:50:29.180 --> 2:50:33.940]  of every big expose, bringing these folks down, very proud of the work you're doing.
[2:50:33.940 --> 2:50:35.820]  We just want to fix things out here as best we can.
[2:50:35.820 --> 2:50:37.820]  All right. Thank you, Colonel Shaffer. We'll talk to you soon.
[2:50:37.820 --> 2:50:38.820]  Yeah.
[2:50:38.820 --> 2:50:43.660]  All right. We'll be back with the final segment before we have our next guest come in, Roger

[2:53:56.900 --> 2:54:12.820]  Alright, Roger Stone got hit by a car today but he's not going to the hospital like his
[2:54:12.820 --> 2:54:17.380]  family wants him to. He's going to be hosting the fourth hour. Just briefly here, I didn't
[2:54:17.380 --> 2:54:20.820]  plug him in the last hour and I skipped the breaks and everything else. That's just insane.
[2:54:20.820 --> 2:54:25.540]  I say fund us. I don't even fund ourselves. We have a lot of great specials at m4store.com.
[2:54:25.540 --> 2:54:30.380]  A lot of great supplements, a lot of great water filters, non-GMO heirloom seeds, Trump
[2:54:30.380 --> 2:54:31.380]  Pints.
[2:54:31.380 --> 2:54:35.940]  I'm a little bit sick of my shirt off photos but it's okay. With the 30% off on the super
[2:54:35.940 --> 2:54:41.020]  male vitality right now, I extended the free shipping one more day. You can get 50% off
[2:54:41.020 --> 2:54:43.620]  on super female vitality when you sign up for the free newsletter. We'll send you a

[2:54:50.940 --> 2:54:55.780]  again about to sell out right now. We upped the last thousand bottles or so to retail
[2:54:55.780 --> 2:54:58.740]  just to help fund the operation because, I don't know, I meet with the accountants and
[2:54:58.740 --> 2:55:01.420]  they're like, hey man, you might not want to skip the ads. You might want to plug in
[2:55:01.420 --> 2:55:05.980]  every segment like everybody else does because we got bills to pay. But the listeners come
[2:55:05.980 --> 2:55:09.940]  through and we're getting censored off Google ads. I'd rather just advertise other places
[2:55:09.940 --> 2:55:13.380]  and fund the operation with that because I just want to sit here for three hours and
[2:55:13.380 --> 2:55:17.940]  not even have breaks but we're formatted for talk radio and that's our great audience
[2:55:17.940 --> 2:55:22.140]  out there. But seriously, if you've never bought super male vitality, you owe it to
[2:55:22.140 --> 2:55:25.340]  yourself to try a bottle and you can't lose as you're funding the truth and the info war
[2:55:25.340 --> 2:55:29.020]  and look at the results we've had. So thank you for the support, those that have supported
[2:55:29.020 --> 2:55:33.020]  but really those that haven't supported, those that have never bought a Trump Pints 2020
[2:55:33.020 --> 2:55:37.100]  shirt for president, those that have never gotten any of the survival shield X2 or never
[2:55:37.100 --> 2:55:44.580]  gotten a lung cleanse or never gotten the biome defense are great probiotic and infowarstore.com.

[2:55:55.100 --> 2:55:58.660]  You can't beat that. Let me make like four or five bucks on it to find the operation.
[2:55:58.660 --> 2:56:04.060]  I want to see a million of these shirts out there. We put out a couple hundred thousand
[2:56:04.060 --> 2:56:08.100]  of the Obama Joker shirt and boy, that became a meme. Hundred thousand of Hillary for president
[2:56:08.100 --> 2:56:12.180]  shirt are a little bit shy of that. You know, I think we're already up like 20,000 of these
[2:56:12.180 --> 2:56:16.060]  Trump Pints shirts. Sounds like a lot. It's not. We want to meet like minded people. We
[2:56:16.060 --> 2:56:20.140]  want to spread the word. We want to send shockwaves across the country. We want to really go after
[2:56:20.140 --> 2:56:23.420]  the global. I want to hire more reporters. I want to build bigger studios. I want to
[2:56:23.420 --> 2:56:28.500]  get more satellite uplinks. I want to win. So thank you all that has made the dream
[2:56:28.500 --> 2:56:32.220]  of resistance come true. But for those of you that are just listening or, you know,
[2:56:32.220 --> 2:56:36.660]  doing whatever that's fine, but spread the article, spread the videos, spread the links
[2:56:36.660 --> 2:56:43.220]  because the system doesn't want you to. They're doing everything they can from Saturday Night
[2:56:43.220 --> 2:56:48.020]  Live, attacking us to shows like Homeland, attacking us to the news, lying about us because
[2:56:48.020 --> 2:56:56.540]  what we're saying endangers them. What we're promoting scares them. What we do is the opposite
[2:56:56.540 --> 2:57:02.660]  of what they're pushing. Human empowerment is our goal. InfowarsStore.com is the main

[2:57:29.740 --> 2:57:34.060]  serve is like, I think 30 plus from what I was reading, you know, chicken noodle soups

[2:57:45.180 --> 2:57:50.060]  one, three, nine, and please support our local station. Spread the word about it. It's that
[2:57:50.060 --> 2:57:55.100]  initiative. It's that spark. The leftists are giving up everywhere on Facebook, Twitter,
[2:57:55.100 --> 2:57:58.660]  and Google. That's why they went desperate. The last three weeks started censoring because
[2:57:58.660 --> 2:58:02.660]  they don't want their little minions, their little bots, their little servants, their
[2:58:02.660 --> 2:58:07.940]  little slaves to actually see anybody that's resisting them. They're giving up. That's
[2:58:07.940 --> 2:58:12.020]  why they're resorting to censorship, which only makes everybody pay more attention to
[2:58:12.020 --> 2:58:17.620]  what we're doing, what we stand for, and what we're promoting. All right. Roger Stone is
[2:58:17.620 --> 2:58:23.060]  coming up to host, even though he's been hit by a car today, T-Bone, and a hit and run
[2:58:23.060 --> 2:58:26.940]  coming up in the fourth hour in just mere minutes. And the nightly news is jam-packed
[2:58:26.940 --> 2:58:31.740]  with shot by Southwest Highlights, you name it, and a big zombie video that the crews
[2:58:31.740 --> 2:58:35.180]  put together that I meant to get to in this hour. You probably play Millie Weaver's thing
[2:58:35.180 --> 2:58:38.620]  towards the end of the hour and skip the last break and let Roger just tell us 50 minutes
[2:58:38.620 --> 2:58:43.820]  we get to that zombie South by Southwest video. It's also on infowars.com. A lot of stuff
[2:58:43.820 --> 2:58:50.820]  I didn't get to. Infowars.com. Roger Stone is 70 seconds away.
[2:59:13.820 --> 2:59:17.660]  You said when you talk to people that have been using this actually testing for years,
[2:59:17.660 --> 2:59:20.780]  people that currently are testing for us, they didn't just say outstanding. What they
[2:59:20.780 --> 2:59:24.500]  really say about them. They want to know how do they get it? Where do they find it? A lot
[2:59:24.500 --> 2:59:29.180]  of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing. The backpack body
[2:59:29.180 --> 2:59:34.460]  armor is only $200. I mean, it's unbelievable. It's a quarter inch thick. It's got a 20-year
[2:59:34.460 --> 2:59:37.780]  warranty. It's waterproof. You can wear it. It's comfortable. And we shot everything
[2:59:37.780 --> 2:59:43.500]  you can imagine of it. Again, funding info or get the game changing in nanotech tubes.
[2:59:43.500 --> 2:59:50.500]  So win-win, $200. Go check out all their different products. Infowars.com. It's amazing.
[3:00:13.500 --> 3:00:20.500]  I'm not cutting into Roger's time here. He's still getting ready to come on. I'm getting
[3:00:23.940 --> 3:00:30.940]  T-boned by a car today. God, he's not dead. Not dead yet. I don't know why this week.
[3:00:30.940 --> 3:00:36.500]  One of my earliest memories is this skull. My dad had this skull since I was about two
[3:00:36.500 --> 3:00:41.580]  years old. He's got his officer. Back when he was going to dental school, medical school.
[3:00:41.580 --> 3:00:45.980]  He encouraged folks. He had bicycles, really cheap, then legally owned them. He has medical
[3:00:45.980 --> 3:00:51.660]  degrees. He can have a human body part like this. But this fella died in India sometime
[3:00:51.660 --> 3:00:58.020]  in the 1960s. Back then, it was India's main export was bones. And India banned it. So they
[3:00:58.020 --> 3:01:02.260]  started coming out with the resin bones, the plastic bones, the artificial bones that are
[3:01:02.260 --> 3:01:08.540]  cast of a real skeleton. But I mean, I don't disrespect this fellow skull. It's used for
[3:01:08.540 --> 3:01:15.540]  educational purposes here. But one day we're all going to be like this skull reduced down
[3:01:15.780 --> 3:01:22.780]  to our most base parts or skeleton, or we can be burned up in a cremation. Kind of like
[3:01:24.100 --> 3:01:31.100]  they do in India already and the Norse do and so many others. But they want to kill humanity
[3:01:32.060 --> 3:01:37.820]  itself. The globalists admit that they want a post-human world. They try to sell us on
[3:01:37.820 --> 3:01:42.020]  how ugly we are, how bad we are as we just give up to their whole system. And I'm just
[3:01:42.020 --> 3:01:49.020]  like, why should we? I'll get you in your little dog too. Why should we give in to these
[3:01:51.820 --> 3:01:57.380]  bullies that are such jerks? They want to kill everybody or dump everybody down so they
[3:01:57.380 --> 3:02:03.020]  can more easily control you so they can feel powerful? And I keep going back to that fundamental
[3:02:03.020 --> 3:02:08.900]  over and over again. You imagine being this mode of today and coming out celebrating Facebook
[3:02:08.900 --> 3:02:14.780]  banning and full wars and blocking our stories and saying, I want them totally banned. Forget
[3:02:14.780 --> 3:02:21.780]  just blocking their stories. They're scum. Imagine you have a newspaper in other countries
[3:02:22.180 --> 3:02:29.180]  called for banning other newspapers. How pissed everybody'd be. But now it's okay because
[3:02:29.180 --> 3:02:34.500]  we don't exist. We're not cool enough because the nerds don't like the fact we have a lot
[3:02:34.500 --> 3:02:39.140]  more traffic than they do. And they don't have any form of chivalry. I don't mean that
[3:02:39.140 --> 3:02:43.020]  like I was bashing nerds in high school. A lot of your nerds in high school end up being
[3:02:43.020 --> 3:02:46.860]  successful folks because they didn't care about all the trendiness. I mean, modern trendies
[3:02:46.860 --> 3:02:51.540]  is what I call nerds. People that think they're cool in high school, think they're cool in
[3:02:51.540 --> 3:02:56.100]  college and then just run around in groups giggling and snickering and laughing about
[3:02:56.100 --> 3:03:01.540]  killing the free press in this country. When you're so stupid, you're destroying your own
[3:03:01.540 --> 3:03:02.860]  future at the same time.
[3:03:02.860 --> 3:03:08.420]  We're going to go to break in a moment and come back with Roger Stone if he's well enough
[3:03:08.420 --> 3:03:14.580]  to host the show. I mean, we've got our guest that we have on earlier, Craig Shorrier, famous
[3:03:14.580 --> 3:03:18.620]  Navy SEAL, great patriot, really smart guy, talking about what's happening in the world.
[3:03:18.620 --> 3:03:21.940]  I mean, you meet these guys, whether they're the Army or the Navy or Marine Corps, they're
[3:03:21.940 --> 3:03:26.220]  all, all of them are like awake, super involved, passionate, all their community. They know
[3:03:26.220 --> 3:03:28.220]  what's going on. They're not running around doing all this stuff because they want to
[3:03:28.220 --> 3:03:34.500]  be bullies or because they want to be bad people. They're doing it because they really
[3:03:34.500 --> 3:03:40.260]  care and want to stand up to bullies. And as Thomas Jefferson said, all the evil men
[3:03:40.260 --> 3:03:45.140]  in tyranny seem to flourish is the good men do nothing. And it's the fact that people
[3:03:45.140 --> 3:03:49.020]  that are strong have been so restrained because we don't want to be arrogant. We don't want
[3:03:49.020 --> 3:03:54.700]  to be grandstanders. We just kind of let evil folks run everything like we sleep, they live
[3:03:54.700 --> 3:03:59.980]  or we're dead, they're alive. Well, guess what? I'm alive and I'm going to take the
[3:03:59.980 --> 3:04:04.060]  field against you. And the fact that you're trying to censor us and shut us down only
[3:04:04.060 --> 3:04:10.820]  shows historically how on target we are. And in almost every case, I'm talking 99% of the
[3:04:10.820 --> 3:04:15.140]  time, these attempts at suppressing major political movements that are based on the
[3:04:15.140 --> 3:04:21.740]  people fail. Poor North Korea hadn't failed yet. Venezuela
[3:04:21.740 --> 3:04:26.580]  was starting to fail. But you know, I just hope all those people, I don't look at the
[3:04:26.580 --> 3:04:30.460]  poor slaves of Venezuela or North Korea and think, oh, look, I'm better than them. I actually
[3:04:30.460 --> 3:04:35.460]  feel like I failed. Those are my fellow humans. And it's a sickening thing to understand.
[3:04:35.460 --> 3:04:40.140]  But that's where the left, they're not left. They're funded by George Soros. That's where
[3:04:40.140 --> 3:04:44.820]  they come from as a place of totalitarianism and true bondage. And those aren't just words.
[3:04:44.820 --> 3:04:48.820]  Those are reality. On a Jamie White article, info wars.com. Investigate Soros. Senators
[3:04:48.820 --> 3:04:53.700]  ask Tellersen. That's happening. New Zealand grants human rights to a river. That's kid
[3:04:53.700 --> 3:04:59.940]  Daniels on info wars.com. All right, we'll be back with Roger Stone.
[3:04:59.940 --> 3:05:05.580]  Well it looks like even the establishment mainstream media has to admit that Rachel Maddow's Trump
[3:05:05.580 --> 3:05:12.540]  tax scandal is a big nothing burger. If all we get tonight is that Donald Trump paid $38
[3:05:12.540 --> 3:05:16.940]  billion to America's government, that's a good night for Donald Trump. I'm sorry. There's
[3:05:16.940 --> 3:05:21.740]  just really no way like I was hoping his brain that it would show not only do you pay no
[3:05:21.740 --> 3:05:25.900]  taxes, you actually charge some government and got money back. Sorry to disappoint you
[3:05:25.900 --> 3:05:31.420]  Van Jones, but what you liberals thought was going to be a huge Trump scandal ended up
[3:05:31.420 --> 3:05:37.500]  being a big boost to President Donald Trump's reputation as a successful, hardworking American
[3:05:37.500 --> 3:05:42.340]  and tax paying businessman. And now we know that Trump actually paid a high tax rate
[3:05:42.340 --> 3:05:49.860]  of roughly 25%. Compare that to MSNBC's parent company Comcast, which paid 24%. Barack Obama,
[3:05:49.860 --> 3:05:56.180]  19% and Bernie Sanders who only paid 18% in taxes. Read them and weep snowflakes and
[3:05:56.180 --> 3:06:02.300]  you can learn more right now at info wars.com. Today we call it bone broth and for thousands
[3:06:02.300 --> 3:06:07.060]  of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diet

[3:06:32.740 --> 3:06:37.740]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength
[3:06:37.740 --> 3:06:42.220]  from the outside structure full of minerals and Kiko factors to the marrow that produces
[3:06:42.220 --> 3:06:47.020]  the blood for the body. This is the engine of the life essence. I'm a long way from the
[3:06:47.020 --> 3:06:51.460]  caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that
[3:06:51.460 --> 3:06:54.660]  made us what we were. And this is a big part of it. I know you're going to want to check

[3:07:26.500 --> 3:07:31.860]  actually have just run out of my super female. I had a few bottles at my house and I've been
[3:07:31.860 --> 3:07:37.180]  taking it again, hitting the gym once again. Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[3:07:37.180 --> 3:07:43.460]  So and I know my hair is luxurious once again. So obviously the super female is amazing.

[2:51:42.160 --> 3:08:39.420]  about to premiere here. The video just got posted infowars.com and then Roger
[3:08:39.420 --> 3:08:42.900]  Stone, he's able to get set up is going to be taken over in a bad car wreck today after
[3:08:42.900 --> 3:08:47.620]  polonium poisoning. You name it. But I got to tell you, this skull here is more alive
[3:08:47.620 --> 3:08:53.100]  than a lot of the South by Southwest zombies. Here's Millie Weaver's report.
[3:08:53.100 --> 3:09:00.420]  What are you guys talking about? Are you guys being triggered or what's going on here? We're
[3:09:00.420 --> 3:09:11.740]  triggered because we're all cooked. I'm a snowflake. Millie Weaver reporting for infowars.com
[3:09:11.740 --> 3:09:17.940]  and I'm here itself by Southwest in Austin, Texas. This is a large convention full of
[3:09:17.940 --> 3:09:24.020]  festivities. We have music, gaming, technology, all kinds of events going on here. It's a
[3:09:24.020 --> 3:09:29.980]  big film festival, music festival, crazy event here. Now, it's pretty early in the morning
[3:09:29.980 --> 3:09:34.140]  and we've been talking to some people out here, but the common theme out here seems
[3:09:34.140 --> 3:09:39.140]  to be everybody is on their cell phones. That's right. You know, you think people want to come
[3:09:39.140 --> 3:09:46.300]  out here to meet people, have conversations with people they don't know. But so far we've
[3:09:46.300 --> 3:09:52.100]  just seen a bunch of people walking around on their cell phones aimlessly, looking down
[3:09:52.100 --> 3:09:57.420]  at their phones. So we're going to go talk to these people and interrupt them from their
[3:09:57.420 --> 3:10:05.540]  cell phone trance and talk to them about cell phone usage in America. Let's go see if we
[3:10:05.540 --> 3:10:15.900]  can wake some of these people up.
[3:10:15.900 --> 3:10:20.020]  And plug them into the matrix. If only there could be a wire into the brain, it would be
[3:10:20.020 --> 3:10:26.060]  so much easier. Inspiracy theorists say that once we were born without wires in our brains,
[3:10:26.060 --> 3:10:34.340]  once we lived, but now we sleep. In the apple crept of hell, eternity opened for us. No
[3:10:34.340 --> 3:10:43.940]  more freedom. Only the great mother goddess of liberalism. Obviously, radio listeners
[3:10:43.940 --> 3:10:49.140]  want to go to infowords.com or to my shut bill to see this looking around on their phones
[3:10:49.140 --> 3:10:54.700]  right now. I don't know. You don't know. What do you think about it, though, that like when
[3:10:54.700 --> 3:10:59.220]  you're walking around, people are always looking down at their phones and not really interacting
[3:10:59.220 --> 3:11:06.300]  with each other very much? I don't know. What happened? You don't know. Do you know what
[3:11:06.300 --> 3:11:11.940]  I'm saying? Yeah, I know what you're saying. I'm asking you about what you think about
[3:11:11.940 --> 3:11:16.420]  people being on their phones all the time. Was it always like this for you your entire
[3:11:16.420 --> 3:11:22.300]  life growing up? Or do you notice a change? Huh? We have some people here standing in
[3:11:22.300 --> 3:11:27.940]  the middle of the road on their phones. Oh, okay, they're moving. But it's about being
[3:11:27.940 --> 3:11:32.780]  selfish and then no one talking to anybody. And they wonder why they like to use the
[3:11:32.780 --> 3:11:36.560]  cell phones as an excuse to being socially awkward. But I think they're just socially
[3:11:36.560 --> 3:11:40.460]  awkward people. You think so? And it makes you more socially awkward. What were you just
[3:11:40.460 --> 3:11:44.980]  doing on your phone? Trying to find out where I should go next, like what talk I should
[3:11:44.980 --> 3:11:49.580]  go to. Are these your friends here? They're from, where are they from? They are from Argentina.
[3:11:49.580 --> 3:11:54.020]  Oh, wow. And did you meet them online? I met them. No, we work together. It's not like
[3:11:54.020 --> 3:12:02.020]  a Tinder thing. We work together. Oh, it's a Tinder thing. Hey, ladies. Hey, how are
[3:12:02.020 --> 3:12:08.500]  you doing? Very good. Did you guys notice you're in the middle of the walkway? Yeah,
[3:12:08.500 --> 3:12:14.180]  sorry. Yeah, yeah. Have you noticed that people have all been walking around with looking
[3:12:14.180 --> 3:12:19.860]  at their phones? Yes. Have noticed that. Yeah. What do you think about that? Are you less
[3:12:19.860 --> 3:12:24.860]  likely to go up and talk to someone if they're looking down at their phone? Yes, actually
[3:12:24.860 --> 3:12:32.580]  probably. But I also work in digital, so I'm on my phone 24 seven. So I just kind of take
[3:12:32.580 --> 3:12:37.900]  it as it is what it is. And that's it. Do you think that they're looking at their phone
[3:12:37.900 --> 3:12:41.620]  because they're wanting to look like they're doing something or they're socially awkward?
[3:12:41.620 --> 3:12:47.300]  Oh, I'm sure I've definitely done that before. What do you think about cell phone usage and
[3:12:47.300 --> 3:12:54.180]  how everybody's kind of on their phones all the time now? Well, it depends on, you know,
[3:12:54.180 --> 3:12:58.820]  what what to do with it, you know, I think that efficiency comes when you know what are
[3:12:58.820 --> 3:13:04.540]  you doing with your phone. And if that saves you time, then that's fine. But it's it's
[3:13:04.540 --> 3:13:10.260]  that it's amazing, right? Do you think it kind of discourages social engagement and interaction
[3:13:10.260 --> 3:13:15.580]  with people? No, I don't. I think that it gives you much of more opportunities to just,
[3:13:15.580 --> 3:13:19.380]  you know, hit up someone that you want and don't bother that other person because that
[3:13:19.380 --> 3:13:27.580]  other person could be doing something else. And you know, we are, yeah, pretty busy usually.
[3:13:27.580 --> 3:13:31.260]  Do you often see that as you're walking around, people are always on their phones looking
[3:13:31.260 --> 3:13:38.100]  down? Sometimes, yeah. How often do people like to say hi and hey, how's it going and
[3:13:38.100 --> 3:13:42.980]  just out of nowhere just start talking and having conversation in public? Depends on
[3:13:42.980 --> 3:13:47.780]  where you live. Do you think that looking at their phones and everyone on their phones
[3:13:47.780 --> 3:13:53.300]  discourages social engagement with just people out and about on the street? Oh, yeah, social
[3:13:53.300 --> 3:13:59.460]  engagement is going extinct. And it's terrible at a terrible rate too. So I mean, not enough
[3:13:59.460 --> 3:14:03.860]  people are looking up, like the world is in front of you, not down here. Are you wearing
[3:14:03.860 --> 3:14:09.100]  this purple suit so that people will at least look up from their phone to look at you and
[3:14:09.100 --> 3:14:14.020]  you can engage them with whatever you're selling or giving out? Oh, yeah, I'm doing my best
[3:14:14.020 --> 3:14:19.700]  to engage people and showing them that no matter the face, the skin color, anything
[3:14:19.700 --> 3:14:25.500]  that we're all people. So it's out here promoting and helping. And I'm doing my part to stay
[3:14:25.500 --> 3:14:29.900]  off my phone and engage people face to face. You're an info wars listener. What do you
[3:14:29.900 --> 3:14:33.340]  think about? I mean, look at these girls over here on their phones. Everybody's on their
[3:14:33.340 --> 3:14:37.020]  phones, not really socially engaging. What do you think about it though? I mean, do you
[3:14:37.020 --> 3:14:42.540]  think it's a little bit weird that people are always on their phones in America? I mean,
[3:14:42.540 --> 3:14:46.580]  do you think it's like this in every country now? I don't know about every country, but
[3:14:46.580 --> 3:14:51.900]  definitely goes on here. Yeah, everybody's kind of got their nose down. Not being not
[3:14:51.900 --> 3:14:56.020]  aware of what's going on around them. Yeah, I mean, we've seen a couple people standing
[3:14:56.020 --> 3:14:59.060]  in the middle of the walkway, everyone having to go around them standing in the middle of
[3:14:59.060 --> 3:15:02.820]  the road, stuff like that on their phones. What do you think about that? There's a people
[3:15:02.820 --> 3:15:07.380]  that just in their own world and that's all they know really is their own world, I guess.
[3:15:07.380 --> 3:15:11.900]  All right, let's fade this down. There's more to the report. It's on info wars.com,
[3:15:11.900 --> 3:15:15.620]  South by Southwest, Donald the dead cell phone zombies. Look, cell phones are amazing. They
[3:15:15.620 --> 3:15:21.340]  have a lot of great tools, navigation, photos, great cameras, you know, recording. I use
[3:15:21.340 --> 3:15:26.500]  it as a production studio when I'm on the road. It's amazing technology. The problem
[3:15:26.500 --> 3:15:31.740]  is, is that people that have arrested development from the TV culture are put into it and they're
[3:15:31.740 --> 3:15:35.900]  just purely programmed by it and aren't really using it for a tool. And so they use it as
[3:15:35.900 --> 3:15:40.060]  a way to not talk. I mean, there's studies showing kids text their parents, parents text
[3:15:40.060 --> 3:15:44.980]  at the dinner table. So overall, it's lowering IQ. It's lowering the language. It's lowering
[3:15:44.980 --> 3:15:50.540]  interaction. It's become a negative. I'm not saying there aren't positives to it, but
[3:15:50.540 --> 3:15:57.340]  we have to then make comments about the negatives so that we understand what the positive is.
[3:15:57.340 --> 3:16:01.820]  I'm not going to be a hypocrite here, but a lot of folks can't even talk now. Now Roger
[3:16:01.820 --> 3:16:05.460]  Stone got hit by a car team on days, but hit with polonium. Now they want to have congressional
[3:16:05.460 --> 3:16:09.220]  hearings every time they call for it. He gets it with polonium or T bone. They don't want
[3:16:09.220 --> 3:16:12.740]  to have the hearings, but we probably pull it up. McCain calls us on CNN, got to tell
[3:16:12.740 --> 3:16:21.420]  the crew or I said, did, but John McCain calls for Roger Stone to be called before a committee
[3:16:21.420 --> 3:16:26.820]  or John McCain wants Roger Stone called before Congress, before the Senate. That was the headline
[3:16:26.820 --> 3:16:32.260]  three days ago. And then now we keep saying they want him dead before there it is McCain
[3:16:32.260 --> 3:16:36.460]  stones. You testified at the Senate. Let's find the video. We can't. Thanks. So CNN.
[3:16:36.460 --> 3:16:41.420]  So they definitely don't want him alive. They want him to be dead to have the testimony.
[3:16:41.420 --> 3:16:45.420]  And I got to tell you, talking about a Navy SEAL buddy here, a great Sawyer, he thought
[3:16:45.420 --> 3:16:48.300]  it was pretty suspicious as well. Roger, I know you got a guest coming up here. I'm
[3:16:48.300 --> 3:16:54.260]  glad you're able to make it on air. Thanks, Alex. A little bit of a headache and a little
[3:16:54.260 --> 3:17:00.020]  bit of problem with blurred vision concussion. Well, I had blurred vision in my right eye,
[3:17:00.020 --> 3:17:06.860]  but this is the eye in which I had surgery for a detached retina, which I sustained in
[3:17:06.860 --> 3:17:13.260]  a foolish boxing match about a year and a half ago. So after the show, I now have to
[3:17:13.260 --> 3:17:19.340]  go to see an eye specialist. That's a very nice houndstooth jacket though. Thank you.
[3:17:19.340 --> 3:17:24.860]  You know, I neglected to grab a necktie on the way. So you get me the way I am. Well,
[3:17:24.860 --> 3:17:28.540]  you got a guest coming up in five minutes, but everybody was here, Roger Stone. We're
[3:17:28.540 --> 3:17:32.260]  not drama queens. I'm not either. You've never in 40 years of politics made claim. You were
[3:17:32.260 --> 3:17:36.540]  hit with polonium. Now they've T-boned you. They ran off this big dark sedan. This stuff's
[3:17:36.540 --> 3:17:41.140]  coming on. Clearly, they don't want you to be alive when they have the hearings. Well,
[3:17:41.140 --> 3:17:48.780]  not only that, but Alex, all of these manufactured stories about my innocent from both a time
[3:17:48.780 --> 3:17:55.900]  point of view and a content point of view, contact with a hacker who may, may be a Russian
[3:17:55.900 --> 3:18:00.860]  agent, all of which takes place after the hacking of the DNC documents. We were trying
[3:18:00.860 --> 3:18:06.740]  to talk to Goose over 2.0 and DC leaks and Wikileaks. The whole media does that too.
[3:18:06.740 --> 3:18:11.540]  But it has caused now a question where the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence
[3:18:11.540 --> 3:18:18.700]  Committee wants me to come for hearings. Senator McCain wants me to explain my ties to Russia
[3:18:18.700 --> 3:18:24.460]  and Yukonovich. I have neither tie to, I have no tie to either one. So he's acting more
[3:18:24.460 --> 3:18:31.100]  like Senator Joe McCarthy than Senator John McCain with these wild, baseless, and I would
[3:18:31.100 --> 3:18:39.620]  say reckless accusations. I'm anxious to testify. I want to testify. Somebody very clearly does
[3:18:39.620 --> 3:18:46.180]  not want me to testify. Sure, they want to demonize the strong man and the ghost when
[3:18:46.180 --> 3:18:51.540]  the ghost can't speak there. Well, and not only that, but all of these stories, the smoking
[3:18:51.540 --> 3:18:59.260]  gun, raw story, others all contain information, small tidbits of information that could only
[3:18:59.260 --> 3:19:03.900]  have gleaned by having me under surveillance. Let me ask you this. Who do you think killed
[3:19:03.900 --> 3:19:08.620]  more than 50 top Russians the last year, running them over with cars, killing them, shooting
[3:19:08.620 --> 3:19:11.940]  them, stabbing them, they're dying of heart attacks? Clearly there's a deep state trying
[3:19:11.940 --> 3:19:16.660]  to kill the Russians. I wonder who's behind that certain guys attack Russia all day. A
[3:19:16.660 --> 3:19:20.420]  couple guys in the Senate. I mean, clearly, I think the same people killing the Russians
[3:19:20.420 --> 3:19:24.380]  want you dead. Not the Russians did anything either. It's just a complete message. Roll
[3:19:24.380 --> 3:19:28.500]  over or we're going to kill you. And the irony of this is, if you want to know what happened
[3:19:28.500 --> 3:19:34.140]  in terms of the Russians and the Trump campaign, it's all in my book. An answer to all their
[3:19:34.140 --> 3:19:40.540]  nonsense. Podesta's time in the barrel. Stone was foreshadowing WikiLeaks. No, I don't just
[3:19:40.540 --> 3:19:44.500]  listen to you. I trust you, but you were there January 20th. You said it's totally fake.
[3:19:44.500 --> 3:19:47.740]  I've said nothing on telephones. They buy this in the New York Times saying they have
[3:19:47.740 --> 3:19:51.540]  you and Manafort on the phone, you know, with the Russians getting orders later. They admit
[3:19:51.540 --> 3:19:55.260]  it. That's fake. We didn't have wiretaps. In fact, the New York Times didn't exist,
[3:19:55.260 --> 3:20:00.900]  they said. It's next level lies. They have nothing. They go for the headline. The headline
[3:20:00.900 --> 3:20:07.580]  is Trump associate had exchange with Russian hacker. They never tell you that the exchange
[3:20:07.580 --> 3:20:13.180]  is innocent. That it happens at a time that is a public website for them when you're
[3:20:13.180 --> 3:20:17.140]  trying to reach out after it's in the news saying, yeah, I'm glad you got didn't get
[3:20:17.140 --> 3:20:21.060]  banned off Twitter. You know, give me, you know, obviously give us the leaks. The president
[3:20:21.060 --> 3:20:24.740]  said I don't care who has the WikiLeaks. The Democrats are the ones doing the crimes. Hillary
[3:20:24.740 --> 3:20:30.420]  has the 60,000 missing emails released the damn things. Well, I agree. We have a lot
[3:20:30.420 --> 3:20:34.460]  more in the show later on to talk about it. The Russians have evidence of the Democrats
[3:20:34.460 --> 3:20:37.900]  being pedophiles. I want Russia to release it. I'm not a Russian agent. I mean, I don't
[3:20:37.900 --> 3:20:42.180]  care if the Easter Bunny has the info. Well, and that's what really starts this whole thing.
[3:20:42.180 --> 3:20:47.900]  And Donald Trump says that if Russia, if you're listening, release Hillary's emails from your
[3:20:47.900 --> 3:20:54.500]  legal server, this becomes a talking point for, for the Clinton campaign. Trump is in
[3:20:54.500 --> 3:20:58.620]  bed with the Russians. Trump's in bed with Putin. Trump's campaign is in. When he's being
[3:20:58.620 --> 3:21:02.180]  sarcastic, they're like, are you a Russian agent? He goes, no, but I mean, they're the
[3:21:02.180 --> 3:21:06.500]  ones with the stolen emails. I don't care who's got them. Release them. Yeah. Now the irony
[3:21:06.500 --> 3:21:12.860]  of course is, and nobody's done a better job of this than Dr. Jerry Corsi. They're at Info
[3:21:12.860 --> 3:21:19.140]  Wars is it's actually Hillary and the Podesta brothers and her husband who are in bed with
[3:21:19.140 --> 3:21:23.020]  I had Craig Sawyer, who was a top Navy SEAL over a major Navy, still grippled sleep with
[3:21:23.020 --> 3:21:27.260]  a tad. And I had Colonel Schaefer on today, super high level, as you know, an intelligence
[3:21:27.260 --> 3:21:32.780]  groups saying there's no Russia connections to Trump or you or anybody. It's all the Democrats.
[3:21:32.780 --> 3:21:37.060]  But in history, they're the ones known in the old Soviet area that had the Russians
[3:21:37.060 --> 3:21:43.740]  hand up their rear end. Meanwhile, Alex, as I write and post and refute these mainstream
[3:21:43.740 --> 3:21:51.740]  media lies, I see Google and Facebook and Twitter fooling with my logarithms. So my defense
[3:21:51.740 --> 3:21:56.780]  is not reaching as broad a cross section of people that I don't worry it's reaching.
[3:21:56.780 --> 3:22:00.740]  You know what? Tell about the car. It rams into you. It's got dark windows. It backs
[3:22:00.740 --> 3:22:05.620]  out at speeds off T bones you. But thank God for airbags next to your job. Jaws bruised.
[3:22:05.620 --> 3:22:10.500]  You got a concussion. But well, I was driving to Orlando. I was in the passenger seat. A
[3:22:10.500 --> 3:22:17.620]  young man who works with me was driving. We were headed down a through a residential area
[3:22:17.620 --> 3:22:24.260]  trying to get to a main artery that would take us to the turnpike. And this car appeared
[3:22:24.260 --> 3:22:29.300]  out of nowhere from our right T bone. The car I was in the passenger seat, hit us at
[3:22:29.300 --> 3:22:36.580]  the passenger seat. The airbags went off in the front and the side. So I could no longer
[3:22:36.580 --> 3:22:43.220]  had no vision. The driver's airbag did not inflate. The entire right side of the car
[3:22:43.220 --> 3:22:50.540]  was smashed in. But he told me the driver threw it in reverse, backed up, had sustained some
[3:22:50.540 --> 3:23:03.940]  small damage and took off. Just took off. And the rear plate was obscured. So if I had
[3:23:03.940 --> 3:23:09.420]  not written a number of books that exposed the malfeasance of the CIA, if I did not know
[3:23:09.420 --> 3:23:15.580]  in my heart that the fact that I can prove there were no rushing contacts, and that is
[3:23:15.580 --> 3:23:22.100]  problematic because the deep state definitely had President Trump under surveillance, candidate
[3:23:22.100 --> 3:23:27.460]  Trump under surveillance, but their rationale for doing so has just collapsed. There is
[3:23:27.460 --> 3:23:31.500]  no Russian influence that would justify such spying.
[3:23:31.500 --> 3:23:35.860]  Let's say this, if you got hit by a big truck and then the truck had been stolen, then we
[3:23:35.860 --> 3:23:39.700]  know for sure, because that's a classic way to kill somebody is teabotting them with a
[3:23:39.700 --> 3:23:46.340]  cement truck. But Alex, if that happens, I'm counting on you to open the Roger J. Stone
[3:23:46.340 --> 3:23:54.940]  Memorial Foundation and let the good folks at Info Wars support your work even further.
[3:23:54.940 --> 3:23:59.500]  Well, believe me, this is getting out of control. I mean, they do not want you to testify. They
[3:23:59.500 --> 3:24:03.380]  keep saying they're going to do it, they don't do it. Because as you said, it's all fake.
[3:24:03.380 --> 3:24:07.180]  Now they admit there's nothing in the intercepts. So they just go, oh, there's no intercepts.
[3:24:07.180 --> 3:24:11.780]  We have the intercepts. We're tapping them. We're watching all of them. Fies on stone.
[3:24:11.780 --> 3:24:16.100]  We're watching Trump Tower. We have General Flynn on the tape. And then it's like, but
[3:24:16.100 --> 3:24:21.100]  nothing said. So we didn't do it like we have no memory. Roger, take over. I know you have
[3:24:21.100 --> 3:24:23.180]  another guest, my friend, but go ahead.
[3:24:23.180 --> 3:24:29.820]  We have Abraham Bolden is joining us. He's the only guest we have today. And this is
[3:24:29.820 --> 3:24:37.660]  someone who has whose story has fascinated me. Abraham Bolden served his country ably
[3:24:37.660 --> 3:24:44.180]  as a secret service agent. But because of things that he experienced on November 22,
[3:24:44.180 --> 3:24:52.740]  1963, and in that period, and his propensity to be a whistleblower, he was penalized by
[3:24:52.740 --> 3:24:57.020]  our government. Mr. Bolden, are you with us?
[3:24:57.020 --> 3:25:04.260]  Yes, I'm with you, Roger. And thank you for interviewing me, you and Alex.
[3:25:04.260 --> 3:25:10.220]  Well, more people need to know your stories. I'm going to sit back and let you tell it
[3:25:10.220 --> 3:25:16.460]  the way you want. Tell our listeners who you are and about your service to our country
[3:25:16.460 --> 3:25:23.340]  and what you've experienced. Because I think you have been wrongly convicted of a crime
[3:25:23.340 --> 3:25:29.340]  and that President Trump should pardon you. But I want folks to know why. Take it away.
[3:25:29.340 --> 3:25:35.860]  Yes, Roger, I heard the tail end of the conversation that you were having with Alex just a few
[3:25:35.860 --> 3:25:41.740]  seconds ago. And I would like to say that there are more than one way to assassinate
[3:25:41.740 --> 3:25:47.700]  a president. One is with a bullet, the other is assassinated scarred and everything that
[3:25:47.700 --> 3:25:53.540]  he's trying to do. And I think that you'll find out that that's what's happening to our
[3:25:53.540 --> 3:26:00.100]  president today. They're trying to assassinate him alive. And I hope it doesn't work because
[3:26:00.100 --> 3:26:06.940]  he deserves a chance. But as far as I'm concerned, I was a Illinois State Trooper before I went
[3:26:06.940 --> 3:26:16.780]  into the Secret Service. I went into the Secret Service as a young man. I had idealistic attitudes
[3:26:16.780 --> 3:26:24.300]  about the government organizations and the government functions. Now, when I went into
[3:26:24.300 --> 3:26:31.340]  the Secret Service in October of 1960 on the President Eisenhower, I was the first African
[3:26:31.340 --> 3:26:38.860]  American Secret Service agent. Period. Now, I went into the Secret Service and I was stationed
[3:26:38.860 --> 3:26:46.020]  in Chicago, Illinois. After Kennedy won the election, I was stationed in Chicago, Illinois,
[3:26:46.020 --> 3:26:53.940]  and he was coming to Chicago in order to make a visit to Chicago for a convention that Mayor
[3:26:53.940 --> 3:27:02.500]  David was given at McCormick Place. I was a new agent and in 1961, on April the 28th,
[3:27:02.500 --> 3:27:09.820]  when the president arrived at McCormick Place, the Secret Service agents had positioned me
[3:27:09.820 --> 3:27:17.100]  in front of a washroom, which was very degrading for the plainclothes Secret Service agents.
[3:27:17.100 --> 3:27:22.700]  They removed me from my position, which was by the entrance door, where the president
[3:27:22.700 --> 3:27:32.300]  was supposed to go through and put me in front of a washroom downstairs. Now, being a new
[3:27:32.300 --> 3:27:39.940]  Secret Service agent, I couldn't complain too much, but when the president came at 8.30,
[3:27:39.940 --> 3:27:45.140]  his motorcade arrived. Fortunately for me, as fate would have it, the first thing that
[3:27:45.140 --> 3:27:52.620]  the president wanted to do was use the washroom and there I stood. When the president came
[3:27:52.620 --> 3:28:00.100]  down the steps, he was accompanied by all the elite officials, the people Mayor Daley
[3:28:00.100 --> 3:28:07.100]  who had put over the president in electoral votes before the Illinois was concerned by
[3:28:07.100 --> 3:28:16.380]  about 8,000 votes. Now, here comes the president walks down the stairs and he stops in front
[3:28:16.380 --> 3:28:21.300]  of me and he asked me, he said, are you a Secret Service agent or are you one of Mayor
[3:28:21.300 --> 3:28:26.780]  Daley's clients? I said, I'm a Secret Service agent, Mr. President. The president looked
[3:28:26.780 --> 3:28:33.220]  at me after one of the agents had told him my name and said, Mr. Baldwin, has there ever
[3:28:33.220 --> 3:28:39.300]  been a Negro agent on the Secret Service White House Detail in Washington, D.C.? I said,
[3:28:39.300 --> 3:28:43.620]  not to my knowledge, Mr. President. He said, would you like to be the first? I said, yes,
[3:28:43.620 --> 3:28:49.100]  sir, Mr. President. He said, I'll be looking forward to seeing you on the Secret Service
[3:28:49.100 --> 3:28:56.700]  White House Detail. And on June 6th of 1961, I became the first African-American to serve
[3:28:56.700 --> 3:29:05.620]  here on the Secret Service White House Detail. And now, when I arrived in Washington, D.C.,
[3:29:05.620 --> 3:29:18.740]  Roger, I expected there to be some prejudice because we were in a situation, a racist situation
[3:29:18.740 --> 3:29:27.580]  that was going on all over America at that particular time. So now, when the president
[3:29:27.580 --> 3:29:33.420]  came into office, you know, during that time, there were serious bus rides, there were racial
[3:29:33.420 --> 3:29:38.580]  strikes, there were lynchings, there were shootings, there were murders, and all types
[3:29:38.580 --> 3:29:44.980]  of things going on that were divisible. Mr. Baldwin, I'm going to stop you there. We're
[3:29:44.980 --> 3:29:51.980]  going to pick up your story on the other side here. Many thanks.
[3:29:51.980 --> 3:30:05.220]  Well, it looks like even the establishment mainstream media has to admit that Rachel Maddow's
[3:30:05.220 --> 3:30:11.380]  Trump tax scandal is a big nothing burger. If all we get tonight is that Donald Trump
[3:30:11.380 --> 3:30:16.940]  paid $38 million to America's government, that's a good night for Donald Trump. There's
[3:30:16.940 --> 3:30:21.260]  just really no way, like, I was hoping and praying that it would show, not only did he
[3:30:21.260 --> 3:30:25.780]  pay no taxes, he actually charged the government and got money back. I'm sorry to disappoint
[3:30:25.780 --> 3:30:31.260]  you, Van Jones, but what you liberals thought was going to be a huge Trump scandal ended
[3:30:31.260 --> 3:30:37.500]  up being a big boost to President Donald Trump's reputation as a successful, hardworking American
[3:30:37.500 --> 3:30:42.460]  and tax-paying businessman. And now we know that Trump actually paid a high tax rate of
[3:30:42.460 --> 3:30:49.900]  roughly 25%. Compare that to MSNBC's parent company Comcast, which paid 24%, Barack Obama,
[3:30:49.900 --> 3:30:56.180]  19%, and Bernie Sanders, who only paid 18% in taxes. Read them and weep, snowflakes,

[3:30:59.500 --> 3:31:03.380]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[3:31:03.380 --> 3:31:08.100]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children. The artificial particulates,
[3:31:08.100 --> 3:31:13.740]  the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems. The same team based right
[3:31:13.740 --> 3:31:18.740]  here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure ground-breaking water filtration systems
[3:31:18.740 --> 3:31:24.060]  have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze. Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself,
[3:31:24.060 --> 3:31:29.060]  your coworkers, your family, your children, do the best job you can to purify your air.
[3:31:29.060 --> 3:31:34.060]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate
[3:31:34.060 --> 3:31:39.260]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves. The general public doesn't.
[3:31:39.260 --> 3:31:44.500]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep
[3:31:44.500 --> 3:31:48.660]  800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout
[3:31:48.660 --> 3:31:53.620]  my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job. Find
[3:31:53.620 --> 3:32:00.100]  out why this system is so revolutionary today at MFullWarsStore.com.
[3:32:00.100 --> 3:32:05.060]  Today we call it bone broth, and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[3:32:05.060 --> 3:32:09.300]  before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk. We are now introducing
[3:32:09.300 --> 3:32:14.620]  Caveman by MFullWarsLive.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth,
[3:32:14.620 --> 3:32:20.460]  turmeric root, shaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great tasting
[3:32:20.460 --> 3:32:25.420]  formula. Caveman, it's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization
[3:32:25.420 --> 3:32:30.140]  that are our superior ancestors, and we need to do everything we can to recapture them.
[3:32:30.140 --> 3:32:34.180]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal. You used the meat for sustenance,
[3:32:34.180 --> 3:32:39.500]  the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength, for the outside structure full
[3:32:39.500 --> 3:32:43.460]  of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body. This
[3:32:43.460 --> 3:32:48.980]  is the engine of the life essence. I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were, but
[3:32:48.980 --> 3:32:53.020]  I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this
[3:32:53.020 --> 3:32:56.380]  is a big part of it. I know you're going to want to check out Caveman, ultimate paleo
[3:32:56.380 --> 3:33:10.900]  formula for yourself, MFullWarsLive.com today.
[3:33:10.900 --> 3:33:27.660]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:27.660 --> 3:33:36.220]  Welcome back to MFullWars. I'm Roger Stone sitting in for my friend Alex Jones, and it
[3:33:36.220 --> 3:33:43.740]  is our privilege to have with us today Abraham Bolden. Before we get to Mr. Bolden, I want
[3:33:43.740 --> 3:33:52.180]  to remind everybody that these informative and I think vital broadcasts really require
[3:33:52.180 --> 3:33:58.060]  your support. Freedom isn't free. And this is why it's so important that you support
[3:33:58.060 --> 3:34:07.980]  the MFullWars program by going to the MFullWars.com store. Now I have come to learn that Alex Jones
[3:34:07.980 --> 3:34:16.460]  and his people put no product for sale on this site that they themselves have not tested,
[3:34:16.460 --> 3:34:23.460]  that others have tested, that they have determined in the marketplace is the very best. If you
[3:34:23.460 --> 3:34:32.660]  are buying natural supplements, herbal supplements, and other very specially designed formulas,
[3:34:32.660 --> 3:34:39.700]  you aren't getting filler, folks. You aren't getting second rate material. You are getting
[3:34:39.700 --> 3:34:46.940]  the very best, whether it is water filters or whether it is probiotics or whether it
[3:34:46.940 --> 3:34:54.180]  is any of their products. And of course, I particularly think it's important to support
[3:34:54.180 --> 3:35:04.020]  the movement with our t-shirts. The Trump Pence 2020 t-shirt, destined for the Smithsonian,
[3:35:04.020 --> 3:35:13.580]  an instant classic. My favorite, the Hillary for Prison 2017 t-shirt, a prophetic piece
[3:35:13.580 --> 3:35:21.420]  of history. This is something you will want to have before it gets to the Smithsonian.
[3:35:21.420 --> 3:35:25.780]  I was really impressed at the inaugural, at the extraordinarily large number of people
[3:35:25.780 --> 3:35:33.860]  are wearing the red, Trump is my president t-shirt. Yes, wherever you go, say it loud,
[3:35:33.860 --> 3:35:40.980]  say it proud. Don't be afraid to tell liberals down at the McDonald's that you were for
[3:35:40.980 --> 3:35:47.340]  Donald Trump and you support the movement to make America great again. So you can make
[3:35:47.340 --> 3:35:53.180]  a political statement, you can help your friends and your family who agree with you, make a
[3:35:53.180 --> 3:35:59.740]  political statement, and you can support info wars and the important work that is being
[3:35:59.740 --> 3:36:06.940]  done by here, here by Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson and David Knight and so many
[3:36:06.940 --> 3:36:13.100]  others. So hit the site and order up folks, support the movement.
[3:36:13.100 --> 3:36:19.140]  Let's go back to Abraham Bolden. Mr. Bolden, you had joined the White House detail in your
[3:36:19.140 --> 3:36:27.220]  telling and we don't have a lot of time, but take us to the events of November 27, 1963
[3:36:27.220 --> 3:36:30.380]  and let people know what happened to you.
[3:36:30.380 --> 3:36:38.180]  In November the 22nd, 1963, I have been complaining to the chief of the United States Secret
[3:36:38.180 --> 3:36:44.140]  Service and also to the high officials of the Secret Service such as inspectors and
[3:36:44.140 --> 3:36:52.660]  told them that I thought that because of the shenanigans that were being pulled by the
[3:36:52.660 --> 3:36:58.020]  White House detail, some of the agents surrounding the president, that the president's life
[3:36:58.020 --> 3:37:04.780]  was in jeopardy and they laughed at me and told me that I didn't see things right, they
[3:37:04.780 --> 3:37:11.420]  hadn't also president in so many years, but I continued to press forward with my anxieties
[3:37:11.420 --> 3:37:19.540]  about the president's life and on November the 22nd, it came true what I had predicted
[3:37:19.540 --> 3:37:25.900]  and what I had told the chief of the Secret Service, Julie Bowman, would happen if that
[3:37:25.900 --> 3:37:34.620]  the agents were not chastised for that conduct and lack of duty around the president. So
[3:37:34.620 --> 3:37:42.740]  when the president was assassinated, I knew quite a bit about what was being concealed
[3:37:42.740 --> 3:37:49.380]  from the American people. Now, here was an agent at the United States Secret Service,
[3:37:49.380 --> 3:37:57.580]  we had information concerning threats against the president's life that were highly organized.
[3:37:57.580 --> 3:38:03.900]  One of them was in Miami, Florida, which described the way that the president would be assassinated
[3:38:03.900 --> 3:38:12.660]  and he was indeed assassinated by the same means and by the same organization, I believe,
[3:38:12.660 --> 3:38:22.740]  who was responsible for the assassination of President Kennedy. So now we had an understanding
[3:38:22.740 --> 3:38:28.100]  and had members in that organization who had given us the full details about the plan to
[3:38:28.100 --> 3:38:34.900]  assassinate President Kennedy. We also had in Chicago the same thing, so when the president
[3:38:34.900 --> 3:38:44.940]  was assassinated on November the 22nd of 1963, I saw a major cover-up that was going on and
[3:38:44.940 --> 3:38:51.820]  it was in front of the American people what I witnessed. I witnessed evidence being destroyed.
[3:38:51.820 --> 3:38:58.300]  I witnessed so many different things that were going on that was corrupting the investigation
[3:38:58.300 --> 3:39:05.980]  of the Warren Commission, and so I felt the duty to do something about it. So I wanted
[3:39:05.980 --> 3:39:14.180]  to come to testify before the Warren Commission that Johnson had appointed. So when I went
[3:39:14.180 --> 3:39:22.420]  to Washington, D.C. on May the 17th of 1964, I tried to contact J.B. Rankin, but the Secret
[3:39:22.420 --> 3:39:31.220]  Service had already decided that I had to go because of my complaints. So they brought
[3:39:31.220 --> 3:39:37.460]  me back to Chicago, charged me with a federal crime, and sent me away to prison for a period
[3:39:37.460 --> 3:39:44.740]  of six years. Now, when I got to prison, I knew that the Secret Service had something
[3:39:44.740 --> 3:39:53.100]  awful in store for me because I had heard agents who had said that if the president
[3:39:53.100 --> 3:39:58.900]  was a subject of an assassination attempt, they would not perform that duty. They would
[3:39:58.900 --> 3:40:04.540]  stand there and let it happen. They said that the president was a nigger-loving, that there
[3:40:04.540 --> 3:40:08.820]  were things that they didn't like about him and that he was going to have a little black
[3:40:08.820 --> 3:40:16.100]  boys, man, little white girls, and blah, blah, blah, such ridiculous statements. Now,
[3:40:16.100 --> 3:40:22.140]  so when I went to Washington, D.C., and they brought me back to Chicago, they framed me
[3:40:22.140 --> 3:40:29.700]  up and accused me of trying to sell a document. Now, this document was no more than a case
[3:40:29.700 --> 3:40:35.300]  report that was going to the probation office. Anyway, any attorney could have solicited
[3:40:35.300 --> 3:40:40.580]  that document. Now, I knew that, but these counterfeiters who the government used to
[3:40:40.580 --> 3:40:47.580]  testify against me did not know that this document was not classified. It was no good,
[3:40:47.580 --> 3:40:53.980]  and plus the fact that I could turn over the document to another agent as I was instructed.
[3:40:53.980 --> 3:41:01.100]  So, Agent Bolden, let me stop you there because you've done a great job of laying out your
[3:41:01.100 --> 3:41:07.700]  experience. It is very clear to me that you are a classic whistleblower, that you were
[3:41:07.700 --> 3:41:14.540]  punished with trumped-up charges to silence you about your serious doubts regarding the
[3:41:14.540 --> 3:41:21.420]  truth of the Warren Commission. And I know, despite the fact that you are a compelling
[3:41:21.420 --> 3:41:27.460]  and articulate spokesman for what happened to you and your life's experience, that the
[3:41:27.460 --> 3:41:32.580]  mainstream media has a greater interest in covering up your story and not giving you
[3:41:32.580 --> 3:41:40.100]  the opportunity to tell the American people what really transpired. Now, as the first
[3:41:40.100 --> 3:41:45.620]  African-American to serve on a White House detail, you're a historic figure, much in
[3:41:45.620 --> 3:41:52.260]  the way that, say, Barack Obama is a historic figure as our first African-American president.
[3:41:52.260 --> 3:41:59.260]  And that's why I think it is vitally important that President Trump hear your story, know
[3:41:59.260 --> 3:42:06.540]  your story, and give you the pardon that you are due. You are an innocent man. You were
[3:42:06.540 --> 3:42:14.980]  framed. It is now obvious that you are framed. So, when I hope President Trump releases,
[3:42:14.980 --> 3:42:24.260]  I believe it's in 2017, releases the rest of the JFK assassination documents. He could
[3:42:24.260 --> 3:42:31.500]  send a strong signal, anytime between now and then, by giving you the pardon you so
[3:42:31.500 --> 3:42:36.180]  richly deserve. I thank you for joining us today. We're a little out of time because
[3:42:36.180 --> 3:42:44.740]  of my travails this morning with a suspicious driver. But I thank you for joining us here
[3:42:44.740 --> 3:42:49.220]  at infowars.com. Thank you very much, sir. It was a pleasure
[3:42:49.220 --> 3:42:57.420]  to be with you. Thank you very much. And thank you, Alex Jones, also. Many thanks. All right.
[3:42:57.420 --> 3:43:07.820]  I'm Roger Stone. We are here on InfoWars, an eventful day. It seems to me that the Russian
[3:43:07.820 --> 3:43:15.740]  narrative is being driven largely because the Obama administration did, in fact, conduct
[3:43:15.740 --> 3:43:22.780]  surveillance on candidate Trump, despite their denials and their efforts today in the mainstream
[3:43:22.780 --> 3:43:30.420]  media to convince people otherwise. I would point out to you that the Watergate break-in
[3:43:30.420 --> 3:43:40.860]  was in June of 1972, and Nixon and his men kept a lid on it so effectively that Nixon
[3:43:40.860 --> 3:43:50.140]  won the 1972 election in a 49-state landslide. It was not until the following year, and even
[3:43:50.140 --> 3:43:58.540]  at that a year later, that the dogged reporting of Woodward and Bernstein and others in the
[3:43:58.540 --> 3:44:06.820]  media, including the New York Times, would uncover enough illegality and enough misdeeds
[3:44:06.820 --> 3:44:16.100]  to cost Richard Nixon of the White House. So it will be on the question of the surveillance
[3:44:16.100 --> 3:44:22.100]  of Donald Trump. The idea that Trump made this up in thin air or that he read it in
[3:44:22.100 --> 3:44:29.300]  Breitbart is false. The government will act to conceal the proof, probably by having the
[3:44:29.300 --> 3:44:37.140]  actual dirty work done by a third party, most likely in this case, of the Brits. I know
[3:44:37.140 --> 3:44:43.060]  for an absolute certainty, and at the right time, I will provide proof that, in fact,
[3:44:43.060 --> 3:44:50.420]  Donald Trump came under surveillance during the Bush administration as a part of a broad
[3:44:50.420 --> 3:44:57.740]  government program where many people were under secret surveillance. This is the collection
[3:44:57.740 --> 3:45:03.620]  of metadata that James Clapper lied about in front of the Congress.
[3:45:03.620 --> 3:45:10.380]  So candidate Trump was under surveillance long before he was in politics, long before
[3:45:10.380 --> 3:45:14.980]  he was a candidate for president. I believe the government had him under surveillance
[3:45:14.980 --> 3:45:21.860]  in both New York and Palm Beach at the end of the Bush administration and into the Obama
[3:45:21.860 --> 3:45:31.500]  administration. At some point, I believe this surveillance was intensified. The reason? Well,
[3:45:31.500 --> 3:45:38.980]  because Trump's associates were in bed with the Russians. The problem is, for them, we
[3:45:38.980 --> 3:45:50.820]  weren't, and they have no proof of same. The problem here is that at some point, the scrutiny
[3:45:50.820 --> 3:45:58.940]  of Trump, which had begun under Bush, is most likely intensified by the FISA court with
[3:45:58.940 --> 3:46:08.140]  FISA court approval. I believe it is correct, as Mark Levin has reported, that the Obama
[3:46:08.140 --> 3:46:15.340]  Justice Department went to the FISA court, the super secret FISA court, first in June
[3:46:15.340 --> 3:46:24.500]  and then in October of last year. In October, their request for formalized surveillance on
[3:46:24.500 --> 3:46:33.700]  candidate Trump was most likely approved. The smoking gun, tack on me, a scurrilous
[3:46:33.700 --> 3:46:40.940]  piece, rife with both inaccuracies and innuendos, but also contains a number of things that
[3:46:40.940 --> 3:46:50.460]  could only be learned through surveillance of yours truly. A story put up by Raw Story,
[3:46:50.460 --> 3:47:00.380]  a fake news site often used by the left and a host of other leftist recycle shops. All
[3:47:00.380 --> 3:47:06.860]  those stories contain tidbits of information that could only have been gleaned if I was,
[3:47:06.860 --> 3:47:16.860]  in fact, under surveillance. So if this is surveillance approved by the FISA warrant,
[3:47:16.860 --> 3:47:24.420]  then leaking this information, the smoking gun, would constitute a felony. The same kind
[3:47:24.420 --> 3:47:29.180]  of felony that was committed when someone in the intelligence agency leaked the fact
[3:47:29.180 --> 3:47:38.380]  that General Flynn was under surveillance. That kind of illegal leak. I have retained
[3:47:38.380 --> 3:47:46.780]  two prominent attorneys, former U.S. attorney Kendall Coffey and Grant Smith Esquire of
[3:47:46.780 --> 3:47:53.940]  Fort Lauderdale, not for any defensive purpose, but to examine whether I can bring an action
[3:47:53.940 --> 3:48:01.140]  against the government to end this narrative that Stone is under investigation and he colluded
[3:48:01.140 --> 3:48:09.420]  with the Russians. If Chairman Nunes of the House Intelligence Committee doesn't know
[3:48:09.420 --> 3:48:23.500]  enough about my interaction with a Grucifer 2.0, which I have pointed out is both innocent
[3:48:23.500 --> 3:48:31.300]  and meaningless because of its content and meaningless legally because of the timeframe
[3:48:31.300 --> 3:48:39.780]  in question. It comes long after the very hack that the smoking gun accuses me of colluding
[3:48:39.780 --> 3:48:50.620]  with Grucifer 2.0 on, impossible unless one had a time machine. So it is important that
[3:48:50.620 --> 3:48:56.580]  I have the opportunity to come before the committee. You see, Chairman Nunes, Senator
[3:48:56.580 --> 3:49:03.540]  McCain, they can't read my defense because Google and Twitter and Facebook are sitting
[3:49:03.540 --> 3:49:11.620]  on my algorithms and many of my close friends and longtime followers in social media say
[3:49:11.620 --> 3:49:18.020]  that they aren't getting my tweets, that they wonder if I am okay. Well, I am perfectly
[3:49:18.020 --> 3:49:25.300]  fine other than a headache and a little blurred vision, but I am tired of this deep state
[3:49:25.300 --> 3:49:34.500]  harassment. I am never going to stand down in the fight for America. Somebody's going
[3:49:34.500 --> 3:49:41.980]  down, but it's not me. It's the globalists. This is why I have been targeted. This is
[3:49:41.980 --> 3:49:50.860]  why Alex Jones is targeted. This is why they want to censor us. They see the liberal seem
[3:49:50.860 --> 3:49:56.940]  quite illiberal to me when it comes to free speech. They hate a free speech. They hate
[3:49:56.940 --> 3:50:04.300]  the First Amendment. Oh, they love it if it's theirs, but if it's your free speech, well,
[3:50:04.300 --> 3:50:11.900]  then they're not so interested. If you look up Fannie and Freddie and infowars.com in one
[3:50:11.900 --> 3:50:20.740]  Google search feed, you should get a great story by Jerry Corsi, exposing corruption
[3:50:20.740 --> 3:50:28.940]  at those agencies, but you won't find it in their search feed. Google, stop playing games.
[3:50:28.940 --> 3:50:36.100]  I'm Roger Stone. Thanks for joining me here at infowars. We'll be right back before we

[3:54:10.900 --> 3:54:17.740]  I'm Roger Stone. Welcome back to Info Wars, an eventful day here. I survived what some
[3:54:17.740 --> 3:54:24.820]  are describing as an assassination attempt this morning. When I was T-boned, on my way
[3:54:24.820 --> 3:54:31.780]  to a speech in Orlando, I was in the passenger side. We were hit broadside by a dark colored
[3:54:31.780 --> 3:54:38.980]  sedan with tinted windows. You could not see the driver. The airbags, I think, protected
[3:54:38.980 --> 3:54:47.220]  me from further injury. The local police took over an hour to show up to take the report.
[3:54:47.220 --> 3:54:56.500]  I am glad to be alive. What's great about the American people is back when I was ill,
[3:54:56.500 --> 3:55:02.100]  the result of what I believed to be poisoning around Christmas, I had literally thousands
[3:55:02.100 --> 3:55:09.100]  and thousands of patriotic Americans wishing me the best, inquiring about how I felt and
[3:55:09.100 --> 3:55:18.180]  wishing me get well soon wishes. Today, when I tweeted immediately that I had been in this
[3:55:18.180 --> 3:55:27.500]  horrific accident, the outpouring of Americans, particularly those on infowars.com, has been
[3:55:27.500 --> 3:55:35.900]  heartwarming and really helpful at a time when I have a terrible headache and I'm tired
[3:55:35.900 --> 3:55:43.540]  of the constant assaults of the deep state. I thank you, if you have contacted me today
[3:55:43.540 --> 3:55:50.860]  or in the past, if you have not gotten your copy of the making of the President 2016,
[3:55:50.860 --> 3:55:58.700]  how Donald Trump orchestrated a revolution, this is the inside story about how alternative
[3:55:58.700 --> 3:56:09.140]  media with infowars.com in the forefront really changed the equation, how the monopoly on
[3:56:09.140 --> 3:56:13.940]  political information that was held by the mainstream media and the Bing 3 networks and
[3:56:13.940 --> 3:56:22.220]  the two cable networks was finally broken in 2016 and how Donald Trump went into traditionally
[3:56:22.220 --> 3:56:27.900]  democratic areas scoring far better than Mitt Romney or John McCain has ever been able to
[3:56:27.900 --> 3:56:34.660]  do among working class white Democrats doing better among African Americans than Romney
[3:56:34.660 --> 3:56:40.300]  and pulled off one of the great political miracles of a lifetime. Yes, if you buy it
[3:56:40.300 --> 3:56:47.500]  through infowars, you will get a signed copy. My wrist is killing me, but we are I think
[3:56:47.500 --> 3:56:54.380]  now keeping pace with orders. If you have had to wait for your signed copy, we apologize
[3:56:54.380 --> 3:57:02.020]  for that, but my word is good, it is forthcoming. This is a great read for anyone who wants
[3:57:02.020 --> 3:57:09.660]  to understand how Trump pulled this off, but more importantly, the entire Russian narrative.
[3:57:09.660 --> 3:57:16.820]  If you want to know what happened vis-a-vis Russia, it's all in this book. How what began
[3:57:16.820 --> 3:57:24.700]  as a Hillary Clinton campaign meme became the basis for a fraudulent federal investigation
[3:57:24.700 --> 3:57:33.140]  into candidate Trump. I cannot commend it to you highly enough, but perhaps that's because
[3:57:33.140 --> 3:57:41.260]  I wrote it. The book has no index. There is a method to my madness, and at some point
[3:57:41.260 --> 3:57:47.940]  I will probably post an index online. But in Washington, if you write an important book,
[3:57:47.940 --> 3:57:53.980]  the people who live there will go to the index and see if they are listed, only look up the
[3:57:53.980 --> 3:58:01.460]  section on them and not read the rest of the book. I lived in Washington. I get the game.
[3:58:01.460 --> 3:58:08.900]  So that is why there is no index. I hope you enjoy reading as much as I enjoyed writing.
[3:58:08.900 --> 3:58:15.220]  Thank you for joining us here at Infowars. I am your temporary host with a bad headache
[3:58:15.220 --> 3:58:36.860]  and blurred vision, but feeling fine, Roger Stone. Thanks and victory or death.
