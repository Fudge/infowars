[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:30.440]  welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Friday the 6th of June the 70th anniversary of D-Day the
[00:30.440 --> 00:36.040]  day that began the end of the war in Europe where so many people paid the ultimate sacrifice
[00:36.040 --> 00:42.080]  we're gonna be joined later in the show with Alex Jones as well as with Anthony Gucciardi and
[00:42.080 --> 00:48.880]  Dr. Group we're gonna be talking about taking control of your individual health and why should
[00:48.880 --> 00:54.400]  you do that it's it's not just for your health benefits there are many other things that are
[00:54.400 --> 00:58.600]  that are pulled in here as we're reminded by some the breaking news today and a couple of
[00:58.600 --> 01:04.640]  stories on infowars the first one by Paul Joseph Watson a new medical law is mandating private
[01:04.640 --> 01:11.840]  conversation with a child before every doctor visit you need to take control of your health
[01:11.840 --> 01:16.240]  care because you don't want to be pulled into this meant metastasizing surveillance state
[01:16.240 --> 01:22.160]  another article out today on infowars from John Rappapour Obama said what Obamacare watch out
[01:22.160 --> 01:29.800]  here comes predictive modeling they're going to be using all kinds of metadata about your medical
[01:29.800 --> 01:35.920]  history to infer things about your private life you're going to be under a microscope if you have
[01:35.920 --> 01:42.040]  to participate in this government-run health care system but this is very very egregious not
[01:42.040 --> 01:47.960]  only can they get into your life they can basically destroy your family if they're going to mandate
[01:47.960 --> 01:53.000]  this and this lady who went there was told that there was no way for her to opt out of a private
[01:53.000 --> 01:58.840]  consultation with her 17 year old daughter she was told that that was a new law she had no other
[01:58.840 --> 02:04.680]  options but this is an amazing story we're going to go into that we also have a breaking story
[02:04.680 --> 02:12.600]  about a shooting in a Seattle Christian school it was stopped by one brave person and this guy
[02:12.600 --> 02:19.880]  did not have a gun he had pepper spray but he was able to stop the shooting three people have been
[02:19.880 --> 02:26.600]  wounded there one died and so the question is in my mind I don't know the details of this I don't
[02:26.600 --> 02:32.120]  know the timing of this the question my mind is if he had had a gun and been on site would he
[02:32.120 --> 02:38.760]  have had to wait until the gunman was reloading before he could have stopped this would he have
[02:38.760 --> 02:43.160]  had to wait for the gunman to get off so many shots before he could have stopped this we always say
[02:43.160 --> 02:48.520]  the only way that you stop a bad man with a gun is with a good man with a gun or a good man who
[02:48.520 --> 02:55.240]  waits until the guy has to reload at all what there are many people out there as this young man
[02:55.240 --> 03:01.080]  would do would lay down their lives to save other people he's a hero his name is john mice and his
[03:01.080 --> 03:06.200]  report to be a devout christian this is a christian school an excellent student he took this guy on
[03:06.760 --> 03:12.520]  essentially unarmed and took him down but we know that if people have concealed carry if they
[03:12.520 --> 03:18.600]  have the ability to protect themselves they will also protect others we're also going to be covering
[03:18.600 --> 03:24.040]  of course d-day we're going to be talking about what it meant and we're going to be talking about
[03:24.040 --> 03:28.360]  the hypocrisy of the obama administration of course he's there today in france with these
[03:28.360 --> 03:36.680]  ceremonies and as they're praising the veterans who did this 70 years ago many of them are dead
[03:37.640 --> 03:43.080]  of course but as he's praising them we see everything that's happening with burgdoll to the
[03:43.080 --> 03:50.120]  veterans administration new information today about 18 people dying at a va on a waiting list about
[03:50.920 --> 03:56.120]  almost 2000 who were told they want a waiting list and they never were put on a waiting list
[03:56.120 --> 04:02.200]  we also have some breaking news again this this is not only the 70th anniversary of d-day today but
[04:02.200 --> 04:07.000]  yesterday was the one-year anniversary of the snowden documents we have even more verification
[04:07.000 --> 04:13.080]  this time from one of the large cell phone carriers in the uk voto phone talking about how
[04:13.080 --> 04:18.840]  the government there and governments all over the world essentially are setting up their own
[04:18.840 --> 04:23.560]  private rooms to tap into phone calls and we always hear that it's just about metadata
[04:23.560 --> 04:27.480]  and that would be bad enough if that were true but they talk about the fact that they are
[04:27.480 --> 04:32.840]  grabbing phone conversations text messaging and voto phone is tired of it they don't
[04:32.840 --> 04:37.960]  like this situation they're trying to get the public to be aware of where this is leading
[04:37.960 --> 04:42.680]  and you know where it's eventually leading is exactly what we're seeing with this new medical
[04:42.680 --> 04:48.520]  law in michigan mandating that they come into your family's life there is no privacy for us
[04:48.520 --> 04:55.800]  anymore they're constantly coming after stay with us we'll be right back

[08:24.360 --> 08:32.040]  welcome to the alex jones show i'm david night on this friday june 6 2014 the 70th anniversary of
[08:32.040 --> 08:39.080]  d-day the beginning of the end of the war in europe and the amazing sacrifice that people paid as they
[08:39.080 --> 08:46.520]  jumped into just continuous gunfire is is just amazing even today and there are some veterans
[08:46.520 --> 08:52.040]  who are still alive as a matter of fact cnn had a story with a 93 year old veteran he was 23 when
[08:52.040 --> 08:59.640]  he parachuted onto the beach and uh he parachuted onto the beach at 93 at 23 he was one of the
[08:59.640 --> 09:05.880]  older guys in his unit most of the guys that were there were teenagers it was teenagers that were dying
[09:05.880 --> 09:11.080]  that day on normandy he said of course uh it was much easier this time because nobody was shooting
[09:11.080 --> 09:15.960]  at him even though he was 93 and he talked about heroes you know we still have heroes
[09:15.960 --> 09:21.240]  there's a story that's coming out of the shooting yesterday in seattle at the seattle pacific
[09:21.240 --> 09:27.480]  university a christian university a fellow named john mice uh i believe if i'm correcting his if i'm
[09:27.480 --> 09:32.440]  spelling his name correctly it's a me is they said he had a habit of carrying pepper spray and as
[09:32.440 --> 09:37.720]  the shooter at the university was shooting he had wounded three people one of whom subsequently
[09:37.720 --> 09:43.400]  died the guy began reloading his shotgun and this guy saw his opportunity sprayed him with pepper
[09:43.400 --> 09:50.200]  spray and he and other students jumped on him and subdued him and stopped the shooting of course
[09:50.200 --> 09:56.440]  that's what we were always saying good people stop bad people from doing things and as long as we
[09:56.440 --> 10:00.920]  have a society where there are good people who outnumber the bad people people who will risk
[10:00.920 --> 10:07.720]  their lives just like this young student did we are better off having our own firearms the question
[10:07.720 --> 10:12.520]  i look at when i look at this is like i wonder if he had had a firearm instead of pepper spray if he
[10:12.520 --> 10:16.520]  had been able to come after this guy while the guy still had a loaded gun because he had a loaded
[10:16.520 --> 10:21.480]  gun if he could have taken him down from a distance would it have saved that life would
[10:21.480 --> 10:26.360]  those three people have been shot would that one person have died um i don't know i don't
[10:26.360 --> 10:30.200]  know the the facts of the case of course that was a question we asked about the fort hood shooting
[10:30.200 --> 10:34.360]  chicare and kate daniels asked the general that they said you know how long did it take to get
[10:34.360 --> 10:37.960]  oh we were very happy with how long it took the police to get there and only took them
[10:37.960 --> 10:43.960]  10 minutes well in that amount of time a lot of people can get shot and they disarm our soldiers
[10:43.960 --> 10:50.360]  they want to disarm the public but today on the 70th 70th anniversary of d-day and the heroes
[10:50.360 --> 10:54.840]  that were there we see that we still have heroes amongst our midst and we're going to be talking
[10:54.840 --> 11:03.640]  later in the show about the hypocrisy of obama being at normandy honoring these vets at the same
[11:03.640 --> 11:10.840]  time that he is pushing and trying to start more conflict not only reviving the cold war but
[11:10.840 --> 11:16.280]  pushing it to a point where it could very well erupt into a third world war and we're also
[11:16.280 --> 11:21.080]  going to talk a little bit about the uh what's behind that we're going to talk about taking
[11:21.080 --> 11:26.840]  control of your individual health we're going to have anthony gucciardi doctor group and alex is
[11:26.840 --> 11:32.920]  going to join us in the third hour because there is an amazing story that is up on info wars.com
[11:32.920 --> 11:39.240]  from paul joseph watson about a new medical law that is mandating private conversations with children
[11:39.240 --> 11:44.280]  before every doctor visit but before we get to that i want to talk about another story that's up
[11:44.280 --> 11:50.760]  by paul joseph watson that's a sheriff calling homeland security on a journalist just because
[11:50.760 --> 11:55.560]  he requested public records now yesterday we talked about the one-year anniversary of the
[11:55.560 --> 12:00.920]  snowden leaks the beginning of the documents i say leaks the the beginning of the revelation of
[12:00.920 --> 12:08.680]  these documents he has been criticized as a spy he's they've we've seen people like newt gingrich
[12:08.680 --> 12:12.600]  saying he needs to be brought back as a spy executed others have called for his imprisonment
[12:13.320 --> 12:19.800]  because he exposed criminal actions of the government they don't want you to know anything
[12:19.800 --> 12:25.400]  about what they do they just they think that they should have all knowledge however about
[12:25.400 --> 12:30.760]  everything that you do many people have said well i i don't care if the government looks at everything
[12:30.760 --> 12:37.720]  that i do well you better care because they're going to in many cases misconstrue what they
[12:37.720 --> 12:43.080]  learn about you through metadata maybe even through your conversations we talked about when we were
[12:43.080 --> 12:50.760]  talking about ed snowden's anniversary we talked about how a british couple who was coming to visit
[12:50.760 --> 12:56.520]  america talked about how they were going to dig up maryland munro and they were stopped by the
[12:56.520 --> 13:02.120]  people at the airport they were detained for i think 24 hours eventually sent home without
[13:02.120 --> 13:08.200]  being allowed into america uh the government authorities did not see the sarcasm in that
[13:08.200 --> 13:13.320]  there are many ways that you could get in trouble with just the false positive but why should we
[13:13.320 --> 13:18.680]  live our life as an open book to the authorities anyway why is it that everything that they do
[13:19.320 --> 13:25.240]  is secret because but everything that we do is open at the bill de berg meeting one of the topics
[13:25.240 --> 13:32.040]  was does privacy exist well no actually it doesn't because those people are some of the key players
[13:32.040 --> 13:37.240]  making sure that it doesn't exist when they went there they brought paper documents with them
[13:37.240 --> 13:43.640]  they met in a hotel that they had evacuated days before and scanned for any listening devices any
[13:43.640 --> 13:48.280]  bugging devices they understand the importance of privacy that's why they want it and they want to
[13:48.280 --> 13:53.880]  take it away from you but look at how this is gone even one step farther not only are they going
[13:53.880 --> 13:59.960]  after a journalist in this case in tennessee who's trying to get information about public records
[13:59.960 --> 14:03.480]  through a freedom of information request he's trying to get information about what's going on
[14:03.480 --> 14:07.720]  about what's going on in prison he believes that there is abuse going on at this prison
[14:07.720 --> 14:12.840]  and so he requests the information and what does he get he gets harassment from the sheriff listen
[14:12.840 --> 14:17.560]  to this story the marshal county sheriff's office apparently doesn't feel it has to comply with the
[14:17.560 --> 14:22.040]  law he's an editor for the prison legal news and has been working on a piece about complaints
[14:22.040 --> 14:27.400]  coming out of the jail he's suing sheriff norman dalton for refusing to release public records
[14:27.400 --> 14:32.440]  of alleged questionable practices in the prison system and included policies regarding medical
[14:32.440 --> 14:37.880]  care for inmates the contract of the jail with phone companies to provide phone services for
[14:37.880 --> 14:42.680]  inmates the grievance procedure and process used at the jail for inmates who raise complaints
[14:42.680 --> 14:47.240]  not only did the sheriff's office deny those requests sheriff dalton admitted on the witness
[14:47.240 --> 14:51.960]  stand to ordering background checks on treatment calling the department of homeland security and
[14:51.960 --> 14:56.680]  even going to freeman's house yeah i think that's very alarming and very disturbing that a law
[14:56.680 --> 15:02.520]  enforcement officer can do a background check and in this case actually drove in to check my
[15:02.520 --> 15:08.120]  residence in person um just because i filed a public records request with his agency all
[15:08.120 --> 15:13.800]  things dalton's attorney said were done to protect the jail like the sheriff said on the witness stand
[15:13.800 --> 15:21.080]  if uh you know he doesn't if he's not personally familiar with the person requesting uh or know
[15:21.080 --> 15:26.520]  that they're a resident then he has to write i mean i don't think the sheriff wants this guy for his
[15:26.520 --> 15:32.760]  lawyer if you say that he's not the most articulate guy the amazing thing about that is that not only
[15:32.760 --> 15:38.360]  did the sheriff just refuse to comply with the freedom of information request but then he pushes
[15:38.360 --> 15:43.560]  back to intimidate this journalist he gave him as he mentioned in the video that you just heard
[15:43.560 --> 15:48.680]  gave him a home visit he ordered background checks for him he even called the department of
[15:48.680 --> 15:54.680]  homeland security to get federal agents to harass him we saw this with wolf gang how big when he
[15:54.680 --> 16:00.440]  started asking for freedom of information requests about the sandy hook shooting this is a guy who is
[16:00.440 --> 16:06.680]  a security expert he's had seminars he's consulted with many different organizations about how to
[16:06.680 --> 16:10.520]  make schools more secure he's been to columbine he's been to all these places where they had
[16:10.520 --> 16:17.160]  shootings and yet in connecticut in the last year rules have changed and so in connecticut when he
[16:17.160 --> 16:20.680]  starts asking them for freedom of information what they did was they passed his information
[16:20.680 --> 16:26.680]  on to some florida law enforcement who show up his house not once but twice to harass him to
[16:26.680 --> 16:30.680]  ask him if he owns a gun that type of thing now one of the things that i thought was interesting
[16:30.680 --> 16:37.000]  in the story by paul joseph watson is that the sheriff's attorney said that uh that this journalist
[16:37.000 --> 16:44.760]  attempt to obtain the records in person invalidated the request really if you're going to ignore my
[16:44.760 --> 16:51.080]  requests we're going to show up in person we've done that multiple times we asked the airport
[16:51.080 --> 16:57.080]  here in austin to give us some information about what the tsa tsa new program with some new equipment
[16:57.080 --> 17:03.560]  they totally ignored what we requested we had the same thing happen with the asymmetric warfare
[17:03.560 --> 17:08.840]  center and you know what when you ignore requests repeated requests we're going to show up and if
[17:08.840 --> 17:13.400]  you think that's suspicious if you get in our face about it you're going to be the story
[17:13.400 --> 17:17.720]  because you're the one with something to hide you're the one that doesn't want to let the people
[17:17.720 --> 17:23.240]  that you work for know what's going on and that tells us that you're doing something that you
[17:23.240 --> 17:28.840]  don't want seen we don't have to have national security for everything that every government
[17:28.840 --> 17:34.920]  employee in this country does that's not necessary but everybody is acting as if they worked for the
[17:34.920 --> 17:41.880]  cia everything is a state secret we can't know anything about anything but they need to know
[17:41.880 --> 17:48.280]  everything about us so let's go this next article here this is in michigan and this is an article
[17:48.280 --> 17:53.800]  also from paul joseph watson on info wars today a michigan mother takes her 17 year old daughter
[17:53.800 --> 17:59.960]  to the physicians for a minor foot injury and she's told that there's a new state law and so this
[17:59.960 --> 18:04.920]  is what she says she says the receptionist told me that it's a new law and there's no opting out of
[18:04.920 --> 18:10.600]  it that her daughter is going to have a private consultation with somebody there at which point
[18:10.600 --> 18:15.640]  she said i asked if i needed to leave and go to an urgent care center because i was not going
[18:15.640 --> 18:20.040]  to submit my daughter to such a conversation she said well that didn't go over very well
[18:20.040 --> 18:24.200]  so the receptionist closes the window and immediately the office manager comes out
[18:24.200 --> 18:29.480]  and confronts her and says may i speak with you she said there's a new policy that would allow
[18:29.480 --> 18:36.520]  a child to access his or her medical records online and the child would be allowed to block
[18:36.520 --> 18:42.680]  a parent from viewing the website well to sum it up basically what this woman said
[18:42.680 --> 18:47.400]  is she told them that she's not going to allow anybody to talk to her child privately but as
[18:47.400 --> 18:54.680]  paul points out this is a long history that our government is not only prying into our family lives
[18:54.680 --> 19:01.000]  but it's also prying into our children's lives it's trying to take over control of our children
[19:01.000 --> 19:06.600]  as well as our own personal lives though and of course at the bottom of this is something
[19:06.600 --> 19:11.960]  where they go in and they talk to her about birth control about sexually transmitted diseases where
[19:11.960 --> 19:20.040]  maybe they push condoms on young men whatever the parents need to be a part of that conversation
[19:20.600 --> 19:28.120]  we've seen in massachusetts parents very angry about very explicit sexual education given to
[19:28.120 --> 19:33.560]  very young children in elementary schools and there was a parent who pushed back against that
[19:33.560 --> 19:40.680]  he said i want to get my child out of that or i need to be there they said you have no right to
[19:40.680 --> 19:44.680]  know what we're talking to your children about we're going to talk to them about sex and you have
[19:44.680 --> 19:51.960]  absolutely no right to know anything about that he sued and he lost and you know what the court said
[19:51.960 --> 19:58.360]  they said when you turn your child over the government school you have abandoned your parental
[19:58.360 --> 20:02.680]  rights we'll be right back our fathers pledge their lives fortunes and sacred honor to fight tyranny

[23:53.560 --> 24:11.320]  silver lungs dot com that's over lungs dot com so part of it is we have to break through our kind
[24:11.320 --> 24:15.960]  of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize
[24:15.960 --> 24:21.160]  that kids belong to whole communities once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households
[24:21.160 --> 24:32.680]  then we start making better investments that's right once it's everybody's responsibility because
[24:32.680 --> 24:38.200]  the government is really the ones that they believe that they own your children they used to be kind
[24:38.200 --> 24:43.400]  of obscure they used to be just a few people were talking about that but we just saw a commentator
[24:43.400 --> 24:50.280]  for cnn say we need to get over this idea that you own your children and i'm sorry msnbc that's
[24:50.280 --> 24:56.120]  right msnbc and this is something that's been going on for quite a long time even over the same
[24:56.120 --> 25:01.320]  issue as to who's going to talk to my child about sex what are they going to tell them when are they
[25:01.320 --> 25:05.960]  going to do it at what age in their life that's something that michigan is now saying they're
[25:05.960 --> 25:11.640]  going to take charge of you're not going to have any say so you don't have a way to opt out of this
[25:11.640 --> 25:16.040]  now when people had complained about their elementary school children being exposed to
[25:16.040 --> 25:21.400]  very explicit sexual information at a very young age in elementary school they took it to court the
[25:21.400 --> 25:28.280]  court said you have no rights you have abandoned your child to the state once you bring them into
[25:28.280 --> 25:34.600]  the government school that is a doctrine that has been called loco parentis and legal terms in place
[25:34.600 --> 25:40.680]  of the parents they see themselves as acting in place of the parents but it actually is even
[25:40.680 --> 25:46.120]  broader than that as we talked about the one-year anniversary of ed snowden as we see what the
[25:46.120 --> 25:50.680]  government is grabbing on everybody whether or not they suspect you have a crime you know we're
[25:50.680 --> 25:57.240]  all now considered to be guilty and they're going to comb through our lives to see if we
[25:57.240 --> 26:03.960]  are violating any of their thousands and thousands of regulations anything that they can pull up on
[26:03.960 --> 26:08.760]  us and of course if you become a pain for the government if you are a dissenter if you criticize
[26:08.760 --> 26:13.800]  some of their policy you will be investigated you will be intimidated that's what we see
[26:13.800 --> 26:19.720]  in the case in Tennessee where we see a journalist trying to get information about prisoners that
[26:19.720 --> 26:23.800]  he believes are being ill treated only fed twice a day and other things he was just trying to get
[26:23.800 --> 26:29.160]  some information with the freedom of request act freedom of information request and he was
[26:29.960 --> 26:35.160]  investigated by the sheriff intimidated by the sheriff with home visits background checks even
[26:35.160 --> 26:40.920]  putting him turning his name over to Homeland Security to be investigated but when it comes
[26:40.920 --> 26:45.480]  to medical stuff what we need to understand one of the reasons that we oppose Obamacare
[26:46.360 --> 26:52.040]  is not just because it's extremely expensive and inefficient because it's a welfare program
[26:52.040 --> 26:57.240]  it was written by the by the insurance companies and it's a welfare program for the insurance
[26:57.240 --> 27:03.000]  companies that's really who it's a welfare program for that's one reason to oppose it
[27:03.000 --> 27:08.600]  it the other reason to oppose it is because the government is going to use that as another
[27:09.400 --> 27:15.320]  point to investigate your life to control your life when we look at the justifications that
[27:15.320 --> 27:22.680]  we see from big status in areas like New York where they were Bloomberg band soda pop they're
[27:22.680 --> 27:30.280]  always talking about how you are a cost to society now if everything is being provided
[27:30.280 --> 27:34.280]  by the government if they're providing all the health care what do you think they're going to
[27:34.280 --> 27:39.880]  say about your cost to society what do you think they're going to demand to control in your life
[27:40.760 --> 27:45.000]  if they say that they're providing all of your health care but there's another aspect of that
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.440]  of course and that is they're going to use it to pry into your life to see if you do something
[27:48.440 --> 27:52.920]  like that they don't approve of like on a gun we also see that the American Medical Association
[27:52.920 --> 27:58.280]  is alerting doctors to probe for that sort of information and it goes even one step farther
[27:58.280 --> 28:05.800]  on a story today on info wars john rapopore points out that a website med ai that's medical
[28:05.800 --> 28:11.960]  artificial intelligence dot com med ai says why is predictive modeling essential to health care
[28:11.960 --> 28:16.680]  say it's not just helpful it's essential to government run health care they say the algorithms
[28:16.680 --> 28:22.920]  of predictive modeling can analyze hundreds of data points to make a diagnosis or a prediction of
[28:22.920 --> 28:28.520]  risk well that's fine if they're just looking at health care right is it going to stop there or
[28:28.520 --> 28:34.600]  they're going to be doing a diagnosis to see if you are a threat to a political party if you're a
[28:34.600 --> 28:41.800]  political threat if you're a risk for the state if they see that in any one of these factors then
[28:41.800 --> 28:48.440]  they're going to start coming after you in a more detailed way that's what happens in authoritarian
[28:48.440 --> 28:54.440]  state we saw that in tenement square as we had the 25th anniversary of the government crack down
[28:54.440 --> 29:00.280]  there is people were talking about that the they said people don't even know what happened if they
[29:00.280 --> 29:04.760]  weren't alive at that time the younger generation when presented with pictures of the tank man think
[29:04.760 --> 29:12.840]  that it's a piece of art or that it's a parade that they're looking at they have no idea what happened
[29:12.840 --> 29:19.160]  because the government has been able to flush that down the memory hole in the terms of 1984
[29:19.800 --> 29:24.360]  that kind of a well-earned state where the government controls all information where the
[29:24.360 --> 29:30.760]  government shuts down all political dissent all political activity where they comb your life
[29:30.760 --> 29:36.280]  for every detail where they take your children away and sexualize them in a kind of brave new
[29:36.280 --> 29:40.680]  world approach that's what we're concerned about that's what we're going to be talking about
[29:40.680 --> 29:44.920]  alex jones is going to be talking to us he's going to be calling in he's going to take this
[29:44.920 --> 29:50.600]  in a little bit more depth and we're going to be joined and then we're on the march the empires on

[35:15.800 --> 35:23.640]  was just mentioning this is the 70th anniversary of deed a cnn had a story of a veteran named
[35:23.640 --> 35:29.880]  jim pwe martin he's 93 years old he jumped when he was just 23 into that gunfire he said it was a
[35:29.880 --> 35:36.200]  lot easier parachuting in at 93 onto normandy beach because nobody was shooting at him but this
[35:36.200 --> 35:41.400]  is what else he had to say he said everybody was scared all the time if they tell you anything
[35:41.400 --> 35:47.480]  differently they're full of crap but you just do what you had to do regardless he said that's
[35:47.480 --> 35:53.240]  the difference that's the difference you do what you had to do and we had a story earlier about a
[35:53.240 --> 36:00.440]  young man who stopped the shooting at a christian school in seattle he jumped the gunman all he had
[36:00.440 --> 36:04.600]  was pepper spray he had to wait until the gunman was reloading because he didn't have a firearm but
[36:04.600 --> 36:12.280]  he took it upon himself to stop this guy who was shooting at innocent civilians we still have heroes
[36:12.280 --> 36:20.680]  in america but obama is in is on normandy and he's talking about the veterans praising the
[36:20.680 --> 36:26.520]  veterans as he should but doesn't it ring hollow when he does it as we've seen this week with
[36:26.520 --> 36:32.360]  burgdoll as it's come out that many uh servicemen who were in afghanistan died looking for this guy
[36:32.360 --> 36:38.600]  who deserted as people are now saying he declared jihad that he voluntarily went over to them he
[36:38.600 --> 36:43.720]  was with them for five years they're now trying to back out of the situation where it's a clear
[36:43.720 --> 36:49.640]  situation where they violated the exact letter of the law about 30 day notice they're trying to back
[36:49.640 --> 36:55.000]  out of that and say that they did it for his health but obama is there he's there with other european
[36:55.000 --> 37:01.480]  leaders and as we see nato and europe and america are now pushing to start a new cold war with what's
[37:01.480 --> 37:08.200]  going on in ukraine they may even start a third world war and then there's the va scandal it just
[37:08.200 --> 37:14.760]  came out today that the acting va secretary said that 18 vets in a phoenix hospital died
[37:14.760 --> 37:20.760]  while they're on a waiting list 18 and further in the article it says that investigators have
[37:20.760 --> 37:26.840]  concluded that up to 1700 veterans have been placed on a so-called secret list quote unquote
[37:27.400 --> 37:31.160]  and they weren't even in line for medical appointments that they had requested in other
[37:31.160 --> 37:35.080]  words these people think they're going to get health care they've been put on a secret list
[37:35.720 --> 37:39.720]  and they're not even on any list they're going to just sit there forever it kind of sounds like
[37:39.720 --> 37:44.680]  obama care doesn't where you go to this uh malfunctioning website you think you sign up and
[37:44.680 --> 37:49.640]  then when you go to get health care you find that you're not signed up that this thing didn't work
[37:50.600 --> 37:55.080]  when we look at what happened with the world war two vets you know there's a very very
[37:56.040 --> 37:59.960]  important story that we need to remember that happened in tennessee we just see this
[37:59.960 --> 38:05.400]  story out of tennessee where the sheriff is now calling homeland security on anybody who investigates
[38:05.400 --> 38:10.440]  his wrongdoing and there was corruption in tennessee as some of these veterans came back
[38:10.440 --> 38:15.480]  from world war two it's something called the battle of athens and leon macadoo did a special
[38:15.480 --> 38:22.200]  report on this last night on the nightly news and it gives you an insight into why homeland security
[38:22.200 --> 38:28.200]  and others who are trying to operate this secret surveillance police state are so afraid of veterans
[38:28.200 --> 38:33.720]  here's that report the battle of athens tennessee is not only a pristine example of the fight for
[38:33.720 --> 38:39.240]  democracy and freedom but it's also an example of maybe why the government sees returning veterans
[38:39.240 --> 38:45.480]  as a threat a town infested with corrupt cops turned politicians who were lining their pockets
[38:45.480 --> 38:51.240]  by doling out tickets was turned upside down by some three thousand veterans returning from world
[38:51.240 --> 38:57.160]  war two the self-described wild vets became the target of law enforcement who made a habit of
[38:57.160 --> 39:03.080]  picking up gis and finding them heavily for just about anything as election season approached
[39:03.080 --> 39:07.480]  some of the returning veterans resolved to challenge the existing political monopoly
[39:07.480 --> 39:13.240]  by fielding their own non-partisan candidates and working for a fraud-free election the gi
[39:13.240 --> 39:18.840]  candidates promised an honest ballot count and reform of county government but on election day
[39:18.840 --> 39:25.480]  a town normally patrolled by just 15 deputies was swarmed with almost 200 armed deputies who
[39:25.480 --> 39:30.840]  turned up to patrol the precincts conflicts of course arose during polling and a black man was
[39:30.840 --> 39:37.320]  shot in the back while trying to escape an officer assault and when the polls closed deputies seized
[39:37.320 --> 39:42.760]  the ballot boxes and took them to the jail opposition veterans responded by arming themselves and
[39:42.760 --> 39:48.440]  marching to the jail in the end the door of the jail was dynamite and breached the barricaded
[39:48.440 --> 39:53.800]  deputies surrendered and the ballot boxes were recovered and the recouped ballots certified
[39:53.800 --> 39:59.800]  the election of the five gi non-partisan league candidates now in the present day not only do
[39:59.800 --> 40:05.960]  we face rampant election fraud what with me e voting and millions miraculously rising from the
[40:05.960 --> 40:11.240]  dead to cast their vote for president obama but the battle of athens also demonstrates how veterans
[40:11.240 --> 40:15.960]  are fearless i mean they've already stared right into the face of evil during battle so they're
[40:15.960 --> 40:20.600]  not going to be afraid to stand up to tyranny when they return to the states and this is what makes
[40:20.600 --> 40:26.360]  them enemy number one to a government that is hellbent on totalitarianism a controversial
[40:26.360 --> 40:32.040]  department of homeland security assessment from 2009 lists returning veterans among terrorist
[40:32.040 --> 40:38.280]  risks to the us a morgan county indiana police sergeant recently admitted that the increasing
[40:38.280 --> 40:43.320]  militarization of domestic police departments is partly to deal with returning veterans
[40:43.320 --> 40:49.560]  who are now seen as a homegrown terror threat tanks guns armor all tried and tested on the
[40:49.560 --> 40:55.720]  battlefield now some of it is here in central indiana on our streets being used to keep us safe
[40:55.720 --> 40:59.240]  plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the
[40:59.240 --> 41:05.240]  knowledge to to build ied's and and to defeat law enforcement techniques during the standoff
[41:05.240 --> 41:10.200]  between cattle rancher cliven bundy and the bureau of land management the majority of the militia
[41:10.200 --> 41:14.840]  that rallied to bundy's side were veterans and while the mainstream media tried to paint the
[41:14.840 --> 41:20.600]  militia as lawless and intimidating residents of nevada who witnessed the exchange express their
[41:20.600 --> 41:26.760]  support for the militia who did the job their sheriff failed to do that is full crap those are
[41:26.760 --> 41:32.120]  my children and this is my community if metro does not have the guts to come out and protect us
[41:32.680 --> 41:38.520]  what are you here for what do we pay you guys for and i want to tell every one of them militia
[41:38.520 --> 41:45.960]  thank you because not one of our government officials not one of our sheriffs or a metro
[41:45.960 --> 41:51.400]  would have saved us that day they didn't save us that day and the government's disdain for veterans
[41:51.400 --> 41:57.080]  is evident in the sorry state at veterans affairs the phoenix health care center was busted creating
[41:57.080 --> 42:03.720]  secret waiting lists that amounted to little more than death panels for 40 veterans 1700 vets there
[42:03.720 --> 42:10.680]  were never even placed on a list at all rather left to suffer indefinitely and now 42 va centers
[42:10.680 --> 42:16.280]  across the country are under investigation for possible abuse of scheduling practices indicating
[42:16.280 --> 42:22.280]  the vast scope of contempt facing returning soldiers so imagine the betrayal felt by veterans
[42:22.280 --> 42:28.040]  when they learned that the obama administration had traded five top taliban commanders in exchange
[42:28.040 --> 42:34.520]  for one army sergeant considered by some to be a deserter and whose attempted rescue on multiple
[42:34.520 --> 42:39.880]  occasions caused soldiers their lives but rather than get caught up in the mass distraction that
[42:39.880 --> 42:46.280]  it is this prisoner exchange stay focused on the real issue our government wants to paint veterans
[42:46.280 --> 42:51.800]  as america's next terror threat these are men and women who took an oath to protect the united
[42:51.800 --> 42:56.600]  states of america even if it costs them their lives why are they the threat because they're
[42:56.600 --> 43:02.600]  threatening you or me no it's because veterans have been trained to take down america's enemies
[43:02.600 --> 43:09.400]  and the shadow government that's now running this country is the real enemy number one veterans
[43:09.400 --> 43:14.600]  your skills and knowledge will take down the shadow government and they know it but don't
[43:14.600 --> 43:19.160]  play directly into the government's hand by allowing yourselves to be manipulated into a
[43:19.160 --> 43:27.640]  self-fulfilling prophecy of extremism instead soldier up for the info war great report from leah
[43:27.640 --> 43:33.000]  and macadoo that's the sort of thing you can see at prison planet tv on a nightly basis we hope
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.800]  that you will support that by becoming a subscriber if you become a subscriber you can share that
[43:37.800 --> 43:42.680]  subscription with up to 10 other people who can simultaneously watch the news every night as well
[43:42.680 --> 43:47.880]  as special reports as well as all of alex's documentaries and there's quite a few of them so
[43:47.880 --> 43:53.240]  it's a great way to wake up your friends and family it's a great way to support our operation here
[43:53.240 --> 43:58.200]  now i'm joined with anthony gucciardi here in the studio anthony is pretty amazing isn't it that
[43:58.840 --> 44:04.440]  we see the veterans so poorly treated we see them being experimented on we see them going to
[44:04.440 --> 44:10.280]  veterans hospitals being told that they're on a waiting list to get health care and yet they're
[44:10.280 --> 44:15.800]  on this secret waiting list listen to this before you comment columbia missouri 19 were on a secret
[44:15.800 --> 44:23.240]  waiting list st louis 26 kansas city 37 wichita 20 and phoenix the big one 1700 were on a secret
[44:23.240 --> 44:27.240]  waiting list they thought they were on a waiting list to get health care they're just uh there i'll
[44:27.240 --> 44:31.560]  write your name down thank you feel good and just shove you off to the side and some of these people
[44:31.560 --> 44:37.960]  have died 18 and phoenix died waiting for treatment because they put them on these secret lists
[44:37.960 --> 44:44.520]  that's the kind of treatment that people who have pledged to support the government get from the
[44:44.520 --> 44:50.120]  the people that they're pledged to support they really need like these vets uh who who fought at
[44:50.120 --> 44:55.960]  the battle of athens tennessee they really need to be focused on defending their family defending
[44:55.960 --> 45:02.920]  their homes and defending the constitution this is the symptom of the collapsing medical paradigm
[45:02.920 --> 45:08.920]  all around us we see it and all around us we find doctors rejecting patients these lists that aren't
[45:08.920 --> 45:14.280]  so secret i mean you can look at staff sergeant joe bigs the info wars reporter he was bleeding
[45:14.280 --> 45:18.920]  internally and they told him yeah it could be it could be a month or so before we even see you
[45:18.920 --> 45:23.640]  or welden who is under the va who works in the warehouse here he had strep throat i mean you
[45:23.640 --> 45:28.600]  could look at his throat you could look down his throat huge white bumps everywhere extreme pain
[45:28.600 --> 45:34.200]  couldn't even swallow water and he went in and they said yeah you know we're not too sure what you have
[45:34.200 --> 45:38.760]  it might just be a common cold we're not sure we can treat you and two weeks later he finally
[45:38.760 --> 45:44.360]  kept going during lunch like every single day and they eventually said yeah we'll finally do a test
[45:44.360 --> 45:48.440]  four days later they call him and say yeah it was strep throat we're going to work on getting
[45:48.440 --> 45:53.320]  you antibiotics at this point he could hardly talk and he was thinking why don't i just go to a regular
[45:53.320 --> 45:59.240]  doctor at this point these people are shifting from the va to the regular md's but the regular md's
[45:59.240 --> 46:03.960]  are so taxed with the healthcare system that is complete garbage that they're all integrating
[46:03.960 --> 46:08.600]  to what's known as integrative medicine now the whole system is collapsing and they see this all
[46:08.600 --> 46:14.040]  the smart md's are going to natural alternative solutions and and really what's happening to the
[46:14.040 --> 46:19.960]  veterans is they're really kind of the canaries in the coal mine because as people were bringing
[46:19.960 --> 46:24.920]  as they're bringing on obama care is 20 years ago when hillary wanted uh hillary cares they're putting
[46:24.920 --> 46:32.120]  it everybody was saying look at the va if the government can't run the just a hospital system
[46:32.120 --> 46:37.800]  just for a subsection of the population how are they going to do it for everybody right
[46:37.800 --> 46:43.000]  total mismanagement total disregard even for the people who have put their life on the line for
[46:43.000 --> 46:47.160]  this government they're not just ordinary citizens who are there i mean they have defended this
[46:47.160 --> 46:52.840]  government and the government betrays them to this degree and so can we really trust the
[46:52.840 --> 46:57.640]  government's healthcare system to take care of us of course we can't it's like gun control for your
[46:57.640 --> 47:03.400]  biology and what people don't realize is most of this is based on mental illness not physical
[47:03.400 --> 47:07.480]  illness i mean you can look at some of the articles we're going to talk about today and also provide
[47:07.480 --> 47:11.720]  exact solutions and get into how we can transform our bodies in ways that don't rely on the medical
[47:11.720 --> 47:16.200]  paradigm but specifically we could look at the new york times saying most will be mentally ill at
[47:16.200 --> 47:21.000]  some point in their lives saying that more than half of americans will develop a mental illness
[47:21.000 --> 47:25.560]  at some point in their lives so you go you go what does that even mean a mental illness
[47:25.560 --> 47:30.040]  it's so broadly defined that it means nothing you could have a mental illness if you recently
[47:30.040 --> 47:35.080]  lost a loved one you know that's defined as a mental illness you will therefore be given
[47:35.080 --> 47:39.800]  pharmaceutical drugs and then the issue is this study actually goes on there's a lot we can get
[47:39.800 --> 47:44.520]  into mentally ill than you were before i mean i was on them before when i was younger i didn't
[47:44.520 --> 47:49.080]  know and i thought they could actually maybe help me and i felt like a zombie and many others were
[47:49.080 --> 47:54.680]  but the whole system now what's good there is a blessing in disguise here the doctors as some
[47:54.680 --> 47:58.840]  are quoted in this article as well this is an older piece the newer ones coming out today all the
[47:58.840 --> 48:03.960]  doctors are saying this is madness we need to start looking for alternatives and that's what's
[48:03.960 --> 48:08.920]  happening is the doctors now are seeing because it's like a person walking around at first they
[48:08.920 --> 48:13.320]  had some cancer cells growing in their body you know a little tumor they could hide under their
[48:13.320 --> 48:18.760]  shirt now it's the healthcare system in the united states is a walking tumor it is just like oozing
[48:18.760 --> 48:23.960]  pus everywhere and even the most conservative doctors can see there's something wrong here
[48:23.960 --> 48:28.280]  and now they're actually pushing against the government and the government and the pharmaceutical
[48:28.280 --> 48:32.760]  industry are the ones funding all of these studies saying that we're all mentally ill everything's
[48:32.760 --> 48:38.040]  fine we shouldn't treat people over the age of 70 for anything all of this and that's what's
[48:38.040 --> 48:41.880]  happening with these waiting lists is they're actually looking at these you know fake studies
[48:41.880 --> 48:46.440]  that are funded by the pharmaceutical giants in the government where it is population control it is
[48:46.440 --> 48:51.960]  basically if if you're not prescribing um you know antidepressants then it doesn't matter
[48:51.960 --> 48:56.840]  all of this is culminating to the collapse but amid the collapse the rats are all scurrying out
[48:56.840 --> 49:00.760]  everything's going crazy and the people are the ones suffering and i know this is a global problem
[49:00.760 --> 49:05.720]  because of course these large pharmaceutical companies are global multinational corporations
[49:05.720 --> 49:10.200]  when we were in Copenhagen covering Bilderberg there was an article here i've got on the uh
[49:10.200 --> 49:15.480]  Copenhagen post right here they're talking about close to one in three Danes mentally ill and they
[49:15.480 --> 49:19.880]  said according to a new research study they had a quarter of all the Danes under the age of 50
[49:19.880 --> 49:24.680]  had been treated for mental illness at some point in their life they said they expected that to go
[49:24.680 --> 49:28.760]  up that was only the tip of the iceberg they had only because of the way they had structured the
[49:28.760 --> 49:35.000]  study but the bottom line is a lot of that as you pointed out is broadly diagnosed any kind of
[49:35.000 --> 49:40.360]  depression is immediate immediately they're given very strong SSRI drugs or whatever we see that this
[49:40.360 --> 49:46.520]  shooter uh this young kid who who uh kill those women because he said he was sexually frustrated
[49:46.520 --> 49:51.960]  why we see that he was on Xanax every single time every time that's a common threat and of course
[49:51.960 --> 49:56.680]  they won't talk about that if vegas had a betting game for all the mass shooters and crazy people
[49:56.680 --> 50:00.040]  if you would just put a million dollars every single time that they were on a pharmaceutical
[50:00.040 --> 50:03.800]  drug like an antidepressant you'd be a very wealthy man but look what they don't tell you in
[50:03.800 --> 50:08.520]  that article that they tell you in the other ones i found this in the new york times it says
[50:08.520 --> 50:13.240]  the findings of those studies are frequently cited by researchers the ones that say that
[50:13.240 --> 50:19.320]  everyone's mentally ill uh policymakers and drug manufacturers who emphasize the importance of
[50:19.320 --> 50:25.160]  diagnosing and treating mental illness and then another one goes on to talk about how the drug
[50:25.160 --> 50:30.760]  manufacturers and the government were two of the main funders of the study so they fund it then
[50:30.760 --> 50:35.560]  they use it to push the actual drugs on the population and that's obvious to most people but
[50:35.560 --> 50:39.080]  guess what they're admitting it over and over and over again how is that possibly real science it's
[50:39.080 --> 50:43.160]  phony fake science and that's what's happening with this collapsing paradigm thank you anthony
[50:43.160 --> 50:47.960]  gucciardi and anthony is going to be joined by dr group in the next hour we're going to talk to him

[54:32.360 --> 54:36.840]  surveillance state part of a state as we learned today from an article from anthony gucciardi
[54:37.560 --> 54:41.800]  where they believe in michigan that they can take away your children whenever you take them to the
[54:41.800 --> 54:47.560]  doctor they can take them away for private sexual consultations that you're not allowed to attend
[54:47.560 --> 54:55.320]  that your children can block you from knowing anything about it and that they will not allow
[54:55.320 --> 55:00.600]  you to opt out of this in any way shape or form very disturbing so alex is going to be joining
[55:00.600 --> 55:06.520]  us to talk about that we've been talking about the 70th anniversary of d-day today is june the
[55:06.520 --> 55:12.520]  sixth the beginning of the invasion of normandy 70 years ago and as i look at this and i look at
[55:12.520 --> 55:18.440]  the horrific situation that these young soldiers were put in the guy who jumped today at the age
[55:18.440 --> 55:23.560]  of 93 he was 23 but the guys that he was jumping with most of them were teenagers there were teenagers
[55:23.560 --> 55:29.400]  that were jumping into this situation teenagers that were dying strauss and how i've talked about
[55:29.400 --> 55:34.440]  how the uh in a book called the fourth turning as i've mentioned several times when i've talked
[55:34.440 --> 55:39.880]  here on the radio about the repeating of history the rhyming of history the rhythm of history
[55:39.880 --> 55:47.240]  they point out that there's a cycle that you rise to a crisis point about once every 70 to 80 years
[55:47.240 --> 55:51.720]  and they see that happening very soon for us as a matter of fact they believe that i started
[55:52.520 --> 55:57.880]  around 2007 2008 they wrote their book 10 years earlier than that it's something like world war
[55:57.880 --> 56:03.800]  two in the great depression earlier before that it was a civil war before that it was the revolutionary
[56:03.800 --> 56:10.760]  war going back they traced this cycle back all the way back to the mid 1400s so what are we going to
[56:10.760 --> 56:15.800]  be facing and the question is when this brave generation is tom brockel called him the greatest
[56:15.800 --> 56:21.960]  generation when they fought and died when they fought evil did they know where this had come
[56:21.960 --> 56:26.520]  from there's an excellent article by curtain emo and info wars dot com the greatest generation
[56:27.160 --> 56:33.000]  sacrificed for bankers and he points out that as they're recreating these parachute drops and
[56:33.000 --> 56:39.080]  fireworks displays and movies were 60 million people two and a half percent of the world's
[56:39.080 --> 56:44.520]  population were killed he said the responsibility for the staggering loss of life and property
[56:44.520 --> 56:49.960]  is uniformly placed on hitler and the nazis but excluded from the official history is the fact that
[56:49.960 --> 56:54.920]  hitler and the national social socialists would not have risen to power without the help of
[56:54.920 --> 57:01.160]  international bankers and american and german corporations like the ones we just covered
[57:01.160 --> 57:06.440]  at bill de berg professor anthony sutton's wall street and the rise of hitler documents how key
[57:06.440 --> 57:12.200]  wall street financiers and other international bankers subsidized the rise of hitler and the
[57:12.200 --> 57:19.560]  nazis most notably the late senator prescott bush grandfather or former president george
[57:19.560 --> 57:24.920]  w bush was a director and shareholder of companies profiting from the nazi war machine and its
[57:24.920 --> 57:30.760]  destruction in europe in a 2004 guardian article they obtained information from newly discovered
[57:30.760 --> 57:35.480]  files in the u.s. national archives that a firm of which prescott bush was a director
[57:35.480 --> 57:41.320]  had been involved with financial architects of nazism that's from ben eris and berlin and
[57:41.320 --> 57:47.320]  duck and cambell they said remarkably little of bush's dealings with germany has received public
[57:47.320 --> 57:53.240]  scrutiny partly because of the secret status of the documentation involving him when i look at
[57:53.240 --> 58:00.440]  what happened i to me the people who fought in world war two are embodied by the character that
[58:00.440 --> 58:03.560]  you see portrayed in the movies of captain america i mean that's what they drew their
[58:03.560 --> 58:10.280]  inspiration from straight up honest uh totally lacking in guile people who would sacrifice
[58:10.280 --> 58:18.760]  themselves for it and yet like captain america has that generation has america overall fallen asleep
[58:18.760 --> 58:26.120]  after that great struggle against evil not realizing that hydra that the secret nazi organization
[58:26.120 --> 58:31.960]  has enacted the same kind of control through the bankers that initially started world war
[58:31.960 --> 58:43.800]  to begin with we're going to be right back stay with us thank you for listening to gcm visit gcm

[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:32.120]  by anthony gucciardi and dr group and they're gonna be talking about things that you can do
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:38.200]  to protect your help your family to take control of it as an individual because it's not only your
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:43.480]  life now but it's also your liberty that is being threatened by this health care bureaucracy as we
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:49.240]  see in an article breaking on info wars today a michigan mother who has told that she has no way to
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:55.640]  opt out of a private interview about sexual education with her child when she takes them to
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:01:00.360]  the doctor and of course we see in many cases that they're using your medical information to
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:05.880]  profile you they may use it to attack you they may use it to pry into your life but they will also
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:11.960]  use it now to pry your children away from you even more so than happens through the control
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:17.240]  points of government schooling but as we were going to the break i was talking about the 70th
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:24.520]  anniversary of d-day about the greatest generation and how i believe captain america was a composite
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:30.680]  character that really kind of captured the essence of that generation the straightforward
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:38.600]  people who had sacrificed their lives to protect other people to stop bullies as he continually
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:43.960]  says and yet i also believe that there's another analogy to be taken from captain america and that
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:50.040]  is that that generation and america in general has essentially fallen asleep by captain america
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:55.560]  dead as you see him wake up in the second captain america movie to find that he's living in an
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:02:00.920]  authoritarian police state where they're going to not only watch everything that everybody
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:04.920]  does where they don't care about giving people a trial before they attack them where they're
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:11.800]  setting up a mechanism to essentially destroy literally kill dissidents immediately that's
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:17.080]  the kind of america that he wakes up to it's time that all americans wake up to that and we
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:23.160]  start stop thinking about the fact that we're the good guys the saviors of the world and realize
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:29.560]  that we're the guys now where the nsa lives where these people have moved that were part
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:33.560]  of the nazi operation as i mentioned in the last segment curtain mo has an excellent article
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:38.440]  pointing out the banker origins of world war two but you know there was another aspect of it of
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:44.600]  course at the end of the war there's something called operation paperclip or a lot of key scientists
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:49.720]  were brought over now of course everybody wants to talk about verner von braun but there are other
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:54.360]  but there are other scientists that were when they came over they didn't do things that were benign
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:59.640]  like making uh rockets to go to the moon instead they continued their human experimentation there's
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:05.400]  an excellent book called a terrible mistake the murder of frank olson in the cia's secret
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:13.240]  cold war experiments now the author uh hp albarelli and his preface he's gone back and he's gotten
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:18.840]  these these documents that have been declassified and it's a very very meticulous chronicling
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:23.480]  of what happened in this guy's life and of course frank olson was someone who worked for the cia
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:30.120]  in medical and experimentations when they were doing the cia was doing the uh lsd experiments
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:35.240]  and that sort of thing uh he told his wife and his family that he had made a terrible mistake
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:42.600]  and shortly after that he was suicided now that is interesting enough but what i found to be
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:46.440]  fascinating about that was not only just the fact we know that there were a lot of scientists
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:52.760]  who were brought over but exactly what they were doing and he chronicles that meticulously in that
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:57.880]  book now he makes a mistake of thinking that well you know this happened 50 60 years ago and
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:04.200]  fortunately now uh the cia is is all better now no it's not it wasn't going through the
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:10.760]  terrible twos it's only gotten worse it's only gotten better at what it does we see people like
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:16.920]  william benny who is a technical director of the nsa warning us that we're becoming like east germany
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:21.720]  and so over and over again we see that this is a pattern of behavior when we go to the bilderberg
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:27.800]  group we see that they hatched the plans for a united europe doing with bankers with currency
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:34.120]  with financial controls like the euro what they could not do with guns printing the paper to take
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:38.520]  over the world that was what they told some of the corporations that they were working with they
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:45.320]  said imagine yourself as dictators of europe well we don't have to imagine anymore not when we see

[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:28.680]  and we're going to talk to anthony as well as to dr group about what you can do to take control of
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:34.600]  your individual health in other words to take control of your life because if you don't have health
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:39.400]  and this medical system that they're creating not only prize into your life as we've been talking
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:43.640]  about with these news articles that are that are surfacing today but of course it also
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:48.680]  can destroy your life as we've seen with these articles about the va system the waiting lists
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:53.400]  that are that are going on forever assuring you that you have health care even though you really
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:58.520]  don't i mean that what's happening at the va is is really a metaphor for the larger obama care
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:03.400]  system isn't it it is and i want to get into a few key news pieces that kind of tie into what you
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:08.280]  were talking about earlier you were talking about the experts doing the research historically and
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:13.240]  seeing that we're at a pinnacle of some type of collapse or catastrophic event and you were
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:20.280]  making parallels to world war two world war one even the civil war now my theory is that that might
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:24.040]  happen we might actually have world war three it's very possible looking at the geopolitical
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:31.320]  situation but imagine if the info war is the pinnacle of this trigger right and if we look at
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:35.640]  some of these news pieces we're about to get to here in a second we get to the understanding
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:40.840]  that things are so bad now that even some of the government officials are pulling back
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:47.160]  and speaking out and what that can do is it can trigger a radical transformation it could be good
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:52.680]  it could be bad but overall they will systematically attempt to stop the transformation and i believe
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:58.600]  and i agree 2007 2008 that was kind of the beginning what if we are at the pinnacle right now
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:06.200]  of the info war at the pinnacle of the intellectual war and looking at these stories here let me
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:10.120]  before you go into those stories when they looked at this they pointed out going all the way back
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:17.320]  to the 1450s that it doesn't always result in war but it always results in a massive transformation
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:23.320]  a complete remaking of society right and so that it could be that it's an info war but one thing
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:27.720]  for sure i believe is that it is going to be a massive transformation of society and so the
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:32.600]  question is who's going to transform it are we going to win the info war are we going to
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:37.400]  transform it into one that is a more open more free society or is are we going to descend
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:41.560]  into the surveillance state this police state that they're trying to create that is the exact
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:46.680]  question and overall i think if you look at look historically with the kings and battling each
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:52.840]  other and everything it's always been a physical kind of aggressive attack now the biggest form
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:58.440]  of change just looking at this i wanted to talk about how one comic in a japanese comic that was
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:05.080]  very popular ended up changing the whole dichotomy of the fukushima situation in japan it doesn't
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:10.600]  even make sense to kill people over over actually you know disseminating information anymore the
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:17.400]  new biggest tool is not a siege weapon it's not a catapult it is online media it's the biggest
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:22.680]  thing why would you even choose to go to war if you can destroy a nation or anything using information
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:27.400]  that is the answer and just look at this some city leaders want to stop treating water with
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:32.600]  fluoride that's happened for a while but this is now in the mainstream and this coincides with the
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:39.960]  fact that a top medical journal labels fluoride and neurotoxin just this week so it's all happening
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:43.720]  and this is all in the mainstream media and it has been over and over time and time again but this
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:50.120]  is so in your face now that even russia is coming forward and telling the un that they need a gmo
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:55.080]  watchdog and russia has been at the forefront at some of this really calling the united states out
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:12:00.200]  not even because russia cares even necessarily about some of these things but just because the
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:04.840]  united states is behind so much of this evil yes that it's advantageous for them to shine the
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:09.560]  light on the united states which happens to just be advantageous for humanity as a whole so it's
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:13.880]  an interesting situation there's a lot more awareness of that in europe than there is here i mean i
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:19.160]  was i talked to people in copenhagen and they were talking about how they'd had over a thousand people
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:24.360]  at the march against monsanto there because they were concerned about gmo i talked to one guy privately
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:29.480]  and of course they've never fluoridated the water in denmark one guy said he's trying to wake up his
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:32.840]  friends he listens to info wars all the time he said when i tell him that they're fluoridating
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:37.400]  the water in the united states they don't believe me they think i'm a crazy conspiracy theorist i mean
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:42.680]  we get exactly the opposite when we tell people in america look at the studies that show how bad
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:47.240]  this is for you the health effects of fluoride they laugh at it oh that's not true that's not true
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:53.400]  whereas in europe they look at it and they know how bad it is they can't believe that our government
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:58.120]  could get away with putting that in our water let me just tell you a good example of how bad this
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:02.520]  has gotten with the denial the overall insanity and then actually a good story i want to share as well
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:09.400]  but read this where it says that the top priority of this group for russia the un gmo council is to
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:14.280]  scrutinize how consuming gmo's would affect human health in the long run so they're just saying hey
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:19.400]  we should actually look at how these genetically modified organisms affect our health before we
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:23.640]  taint the entire world food supply with it and it's like oh my goodness how could you even possibly
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:27.960]  think that you know no but we because see it's all about monsanto and these corporations making
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:33.400]  profits and if we take our time and look at the effects of what they're creating then they lose
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:37.400]  their patent so they got to rush it out to us without any testing so they can make the most
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:41.560]  amount of money well what's also really funny is they know that people aren't buying it anymore
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:46.200]  so they're going around patenting all these different seed types and what's happening is the
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:50.040]  organic farms being run out entirely because they're they're going after the organic farms
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:52.840]  for their patenting because they know what's happening but let me share with you a good
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:59.400]  story so i was at a restaurant the other day in austin and our server was this woman and nothing
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:04.680]  gets people with tattoos but she was covered in tattoos uh you know very short haircut and and
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:08.440]  looked like somebody that was your average trendy that would absolutely hate alex or anything like
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:14.760]  that and she goes hey are you anthony kuturi said yes i am she goes i love alex you know but that
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:18.920]  wasn't the key thing that happens all the time what the key thing was is she explained to me she
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:23.480]  goes yeah i used to be a huge fan of obama you know i still used to consider myself an ancient
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:29.640]  type of democrat but how can you go along with this system when it's so disgustingly corrupted
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:35.800]  how can you even even for a semblance of a second think that this is real and then the person next
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:40.520]  to her who also looked like somebody that was you know typically would be a total trendy was like
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:44.600]  you know i completely agree she's like i'm not saying i'm a republican or democrat but she's
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:48.920]  like i cannot align myself with anything these days that's in the news which is predominantly
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:52.520]  democrat and then the whole it was like a it was like a train there was like eight people then
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:56.120]  like conversing you'd be like yeah it totally makes sense you know and this one guy was like i
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:59.560]  didn't even know he had a third option and they were like no you should you should listen alex
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:04.760]  it makes all sense and and they were like oh wow it's like you don't even know the kind of people
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:09.000]  that really get this everyone is getting this it's a total transformation that's what they're
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:14.680]  afraid of exactly there's certain things that are kind of core this whole week for instance
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:20.280]  npr has been doing a pr campaign and i guess that's national public relations radio for the
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:25.400]  government has been doing a campaign about common core trying to tell people how wonderful how
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:29.880]  advanced it is how it's not actually a curriculum but at the same time today one of the news articles
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:34.280]  is how the governor of oklahoma has said we're not going to do common core anymore and you've got
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:39.160]  people on both the left and the right you've got people who are outside of the education
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:43.320]  establishment who don't like it like me i don't like governments running schools i think that's a
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:47.400]  bad idea inherently but then you've got people who are very much believe in that system that are
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:52.200]  inside of it and they're both revolting against this common core curriculum and you've got people
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:58.360]  who are understanding that we can't have any freedoms to debate some of the other things
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:04.040]  that we do have genuine disagreements over if we live in a police surveillance state if we have
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:09.960]  no rights if we you know if if this whole thing is at rollback so there are some core things that
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:15.480]  the left and the right have to agree on that we have to get back to before we can you know we can't
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:20.040]  let them subdivide us on these and these other issues that although they are important we will
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:24.280]  not have the freedom to discuss those issues if we live in a police state if we have a the government
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:27.480]  controlling everything about our health care well it's almost like when the government does
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:32.760]  really really bad things it unifies everyone and it's advantageous to us it's like the worst
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:37.960]  things they do the more they overall lose support and we come together which is their worst nightmare
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:42.040]  and they think they can use divide and conquer but when something like obama care comes out or
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:47.480]  something like common core or or any of these things or the gmo issue or whatever we are united
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:51.880]  in such a way that it doesn't even matter if we have some differing of opinions on slight issues
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:56.600]  it doesn't matter all these issues are coming together and they're having this massive effect
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:01.160]  where everyone can see in the middle you know it's like left right garbage in the middle we're all
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:05.320]  coming together and saying well it doesn't even matter you know if we can agree that common core
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:09.400]  is terrible if we can't agree that genetically modifying the entire food supply is probably not
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:13.320]  a good idea you know if we can agree that obama care is not free it's a total failure written
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:16.600]  by the insurance companies which pretty much everyone i've talked to agrees with anyone that
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:19.960]  actually you know besides the people that don't even know what you're talking about and just say
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:24.520]  oh i don't know about that the totally delusional people that can never really be helped everyone
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:28.520]  is in agreeance and that is the ultimate culmination and going back to what you were saying the
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:33.480]  ultimate not even crisis the ultimate turning point and the ultimate transformation that will
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:37.560]  supersede any world wars that have happened before it because it will be an ideological
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:43.320]  transformation yes just like how we won world war two well we won the war but our ideological
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:48.680]  transformation was for the worse over time because we became decadent fat happy and dumb yes you know
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:53.240]  now we're actually going to have a lasting change through an intellectual revolution
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:58.040]  by winning the information war yes and that is the only way to have success or else we will be like
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:02.520]  rome we will be like the united states has become the way i look at world war two for instance is
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:07.160]  the way the asymmetric warfare center looks at these other conflicts that we've had since then
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:11.640]  where they would go in and they would have a tremendous military victory but they couldn't
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:15.720]  hold the area because they get and couldn't get the minds and hearts and minds the people that
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:20.680]  they had invaded whatever i think what happened was we won a physical war with world war two
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:27.880]  but as far as the principles as far as the ideas of eugenics of total control consolidation
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:32.040]  and and what the bankers were doing essentially we have lost that and now that we're in an
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:37.400]  information age hopefully hopefully this information war will help us to prevail in the
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:42.360]  in the information age and hopefully we can do this as an information war but the most important
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:47.800]  thing is who wins the hearts and minds of people so regardless of whether there's a physical war
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:54.360]  or not the info war is still going to be the ultimate high ground and the way that there's a
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:58.520]  victory absolutely and the way to do that is to get out there to spread the information
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:03.880]  and also support key operations like info wars and that is why we have the info wars life
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:09.800]  products like survival shield x2 the new almost double strength survival shield which is the
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:14.200]  same price as the old survival shield we kept the same price we enhanced the formula we're
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:18.600]  going to talk to dr group specifically not on that just health issues but he can explain
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:22.760]  seven thousand to ten thousand feet below the earth's surface we take it from a salt solution
[01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:27.880]  that is around two hundred million years old and take the super fine purple iodine crystals from
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:33.320]  that and create survival shield x2 and that is below Fukushima's devastating facts that is
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:38.200]  we are testing all of it for radiation before we get it out and it is on sale right now for
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:43.000]  the same price as survival shield almost double strength at info wars life dot com you're supporting

[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:17.160]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight I'm joined in the studio with Anthony
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:21.560]  Gucciardi we have Dr. Group on the line and Alex is going to be joining us in just a second
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:27.880]  Dr. Group you've probably heard us talking in this last segment about the information war about
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:31.160]  whether or not people are going to take control of their lives take control of their health
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:38.200]  what's your feeling on that you know I feel we've come a long way uh considering the fact that
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:42.840]  more people are not getting the results that they want especially in health care and so they're
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:47.320]  going online and they're asking their doctors what they can do about their certain conditions and
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:53.160]  diseases and their doctors are just you know clueless so I think that the information that
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:59.000]  everybody's putting out is definitely having a good effect on society and slowly but surely
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:05.080]  we're changing but there's a major attack as we know Alex talks about it all the time and we guys
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:12.120]  we all talk about it which is on our health care I'm always about finding why things are happening
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:17.880]  you know and tracing back whether you look at GMOs you look at the fluoride in the water you look
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:23.000]  at the psychological warfare that's going on you look at the electromagnetic frequencies with the
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:29.160]  cell phones I mean the parasites that they're spraying the toxins in the air the food the water
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:36.600]  the beverages why is all that happening we why is this big conspiracy by the global is going on
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:43.240]  and it all traced back if you look at the root cause of all of it is to destroy the mind and
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:51.880]  destroy the body the only opposition to the agendas that are going on right now is a healthy person
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:56.920]  somebody who can think properly somebody who's not stressed out all the time somebody who's
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:02.040]  healthy that has energy levels that are high somebody who's not sick or somebody who's not
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:10.520]  relying on the doctor so what I've done is taken every single mentally abusing chemical out there
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:17.800]  or brain altering chemical found out where it's come where it comes from as well as every single
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:23.160]  substance that causes disease out there and traced it all back so one of the solutions
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:30.280]  is when people take the step to learn about all these things in their environment whether
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:35.640]  it's coming in wherever it's coming into their body from and make changes in their life I mean
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:42.360]  because the stronger our mental capacity is the stronger our body is that's what they're really
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:50.040]  really scared of because every single if you look at the spoken hub model and you have a body in the
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:56.440]  hub a perfect healthy body that can think and that can function and then you look at all the spikes
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:03.320]  or all the spokes around it and fluoride is coming at you from one spoke and chemtrails
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:08.760]  are coming at you from another and the chemicals and heavy metals are all coming at you well it's
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:15.800]  designed to lower your IQ it's designed to make you not be able to think and but people are
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:20.280]  realizing this though aren't they on a really serious basis I mean looking at some of the key
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:24.280]  articles today the city officials are now saying hey yeah we do actually need to get this out of
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:30.120]  the water supply as top journals are coinciding with this saying it is bad so the key thing is
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:35.480]  we can take our health into our own hands and succeed but on a global level people are waking
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:41.480]  up to this because it's so in your face and so evil I mean don't you find that as well absolutely
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:47.400]  I mean I do find that and even some congressmen and senators and stuff are contacting us wanting
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:51.800]  to know more about more information about fluoride or more information about some of these other
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:57.240]  things but so let's say you have all these chemicals that they're using in this psychological
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:04.840]  warfare I mean with that 17 year old girl you know the mom and then having doctors do private
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:12.840]  conversations that ties into the whole creation of the psychological warfare the psychotrophic drugs
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:19.480]  which you talked about earlier of having children diagnosed with some form of mental illness from
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:24.200]  the time they're young from the top there's five-year-olds that are committing suicide because
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:31.080]  of psychotrophic drugs right now they're setting this up to where if they ask these young children
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:36.440]  do you have any depression do you have any anxiety or anything like that they can be labeled with a
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:42.360]  mental illness from the time that they're at an early age if you're labeled as a mental illness
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:46.680]  the government automatically has control over you they can throw you in jail they can throw you in a
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:52.120]  mental institution they can do whatever they want with you not only that but you factor in the drugs
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:59.720]  that they're giving these children that contain fluoride derivatives that cause suicidal tendencies
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:07.000]  that cause low IQs all this stuff is legal to do because they don't even need a diagnosis how are
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:15.560]  you there's no scientific testing through the blood or any type of MRI or any machine that can say
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:19.880]  oh this person has a mental illness they just say oh you're biting your fingernails too much you
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:27.800]  must have a mental illness or now you can leave a psychiatrist's office and not even be diagnosed
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:34.440]  with anything and the psychiatrist can label you with a mental illness because you left without
[01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:39.400]  receiving care which means you must be mentally ill from going there we're gonna take a break
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:42.920]  dr. group we're gonna be right back that's what they're doing to gun owners they all they have to
[01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:46.840]  do is assert that you're mentally ill and of course that's the definition how do you define
[01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:51.400]  mentally ill how do you find a felony we're gonna be right back the empires on the run

[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:31.080]  anthony gucciardi and we have on the line dr group and we were talking just before the break
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:38.520]  about how the government can use the health system to gain control of your life you know we've had
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:42.600]  in the wake of some of these shootings we've had a lot of conservative commentators say yeah you
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:46.520]  know what we really need don't take guns away from honest people but we really need to have
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:53.080]  heavier screening for people who are crazy or people who are felons well you know what the
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:59.240]  way you define those two things is very telling because you can who has a definition for who's
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:03.000]  insane i mean is that going to be the same type of thing we've seen in the soviet union where they
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:08.760]  just merely one individual asserts that you are uh have some mental issues and so now you're you're
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:14.120]  taken out we've seen that happen in authoritarian societies before or even a felony we've seen
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:19.880]  people charged with multiple felonies for releasing balloons on a beach because that
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:25.320]  was a felony offense that person when you think of uh someone with a mental illness you think of
[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:30.040]  somebody who is very dangerously insane when you think of a felony you think of somebody who is
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:35.480]  criminally dangerous and yet those definitions and how they're defined who defines them what the
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:42.840]  process is for defining that is very very important and it just shows us how the health system can be
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:49.800]  used as a control point in our lives not just for our personal physical health but also for
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:55.320]  our freedoms doctor group you were talking about uh how they would use mental illness to control
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:35:00.040]  people and of course we've seen that with uh ritalin for many decades in the schools diagnosing
[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:05.880]  children as having uh uh attention disorder and then prescribing massive doses of ritalin
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:12.360]  right because it's the easiest way to get into somebody at an early age because there's no testing
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:16.120]  involved they don't have to take blood work or they don't have to do anything like that they can
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:22.200]  just rely on what the teacher says i mean now they're even talking about doing mandatory
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:27.800]  psychological testing in schools they're even doing it right now where uh students in high school
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:32.840]  are filling out uh psychological tests and then they're being referred to psychiatrists to get on
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:38.600]  some sort of medication so you know in the medical system the way it was designed initially was
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:43.160]  they had to go through a process of diagnosis you had to go through blood tests urine tests
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:48.920]  hair tests you had to go through a whole list of symptoms and the doctor would decide by reading
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:56.280]  those tests or any type of x-rays or any type of scan saying okay you fit the the the description
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:36:02.200]  for diabetes you know you have your glucose levels are off etc etc over a period of time
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:08.920]  but with psychotrophic or psychological or mental illnesses out there there's no need for that also
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:16.920]  one has to do is go on a recommendation or the parents which are being manipulated also by other
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:22.520]  people around especially teachers are bringing their kids in and uh their kids are leaving
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:27.080]  with some sort of medications and you want to talk about not only the chemical warfare that's
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:32.760]  being put upon us but talking about the the information the negative information out there
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:38.920]  well how does that affect us because that's one of the strategies too because it creates stress in
[01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:44.040]  us you know any type of negative news is always going to keep our immune system down because
[01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:49.240]  we're going to be stressed out all the time they break up the family so of course that that causes
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:55.160]  stress and depression for the children so you look at the negative emotions you know resentment
[01:36:55.160 --> 01:37:03.240]  jealousy anger in schools that's going on especially the depression itself um the bullying in schools
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:07.800]  all that's done by design because they know that they can affect you mentally and then they're
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:12.840]  going to have you on prescription medications for all those mental disorders and it's not just one
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:17.880]  medication it's multiple medications well let me ask you a question dr. group how do people not
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:22.280]  realize i mean you don't need a deep business background to understand when there's a private
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:27.480]  screening room for your children and they tell them to take birth control and antidepressants
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:32.280]  it's like a used car dealership that you don't need a degree in business to understand that when
[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:38.280]  you go to the doctor's office or when high schools are giving kids uh tests psychological testing
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:43.560]  and at the same time the government is funding the studies that show everyone is mentally ill
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:48.440]  along with the pharmaceutical companies that maybe something is going on here and meanwhile
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:53.880]  i've spoken to doctor doctors and i've seen the list you can lose your license for texting a patient
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:58.440]  if you have a patient that comes into your clinic or the hospital or wherever you work
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:02.200]  and you have a patient and you text them on your personal cell phone and say something like hey hope
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:07.880]  you're feeling better you can lose your license for that but it's okay to privately screen 17
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:11.800]  year old girls or 12 year olds in california and tell them they need birth control and to be
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:17.000]  sexually promiscuous and that they need to be you know injected with a million vaccines and that
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.960]  overall antidepressants are good and they're probably mentally ill without any actual screening so
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:26.840]  how do people not see that because that seems pretty obvious to me it sounds like a really
[01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:32.440]  evil used car dealership and they can't even text a patient but they can prescribe 17 year olds
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:36.760]  antidepressants when they just broke up with their boyfriend or girlfriend and feel a little upset
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:43.000]  how does that work it's it's it's the bandaid problem that we're dealing with it's like you
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:47.640]  have something over here so you just stick a bandaid over it and fixes it parents don't want to
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:54.600]  deal with situations they don't want to deal with the right way to deal with a child who is
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:58.920]  angry or depressed and spend the time but you have the father that's out working all the time now
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:05.080]  you have broken families the mother's you know has to have a job too so there's really no family
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:10.280]  core values that are left i mean there's not people that are sitting around having nice family
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:15.720]  dinners anymore or spending a lot of time with their kids and talking to their kids about their
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:21.880]  problems because it's easier from what they've heard you know it's easy to manipulate the mind
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:26.120]  if you just tell people what they want to hear tell people something multiple times you start
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:32.520]  believing it and the constant commercials on tv the constant media that they're reading the constant
[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:37.880]  pressure from all their friends you know they'll post oh my daughter is is dealing with depression
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:41.480]  because she broke up with her boyfriend and then the next thing you know you have a bunch of their
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:47.320]  friends on facebook saying well go see my doctor go see my psychiatrist you know he'll take care of
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:51.880]  it and you don't have to deal with it he'll just give her an antidepressant and she'll be fine
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:55.960]  they don't care anymore and it really shows in who's in charge though too because you have a bunch
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:40:01.560]  of weird bureaucrats in charge who are evil and basically making money on all of this for example
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:06.680]  i've read and i wanted to get into this a little bit i've read they list about once a month i think
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:12.040]  they send out emails and letters about doctors who've lost their license or have been suspended
[01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:17.080]  and i've read them some of them are pretty serious you know like major surgical issues or whatever
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:22.440]  cut a vein artery or something horrible but then i've read you know gave a patient a hug
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:27.080]  inappropriately and it's like what does that mean you read the description oh the patient felt better
[01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:32.760]  after a cold so the the doctor gave the female patient a hug and the female patient felt uncomfortable
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:39.400]  so he lost his license or another one was i guess this doctor had gone to a restaurant or bar and
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:42.840]  seen the patient outside of work and said hey you know so and so hope you're feeling better how are
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:48.360]  you doing and she felt intimidated that he had gone up and talked to her so they're losing their
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:52.200]  license for this kind of stuff because of the bureaucracy but they're allowed to pretty much
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:56.920]  get away with anything else yeah i mean 800,000 people a year die from this and we're not allowed
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:41:01.960]  to know what the history is of a particular doctor or hospital all that information is again
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:06.520]  kept they can take all the money from the drug companies and me and group have talked before
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:11.480]  he can highlight this i've seen doctor's offices with all the pens and the gifts and everything
[01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:16.200]  they used to just give cars to doctors to prescribe things they use women to come in really attractive
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:20.680]  sales women for drug uh drug reps and and doctor group shared a story with me i'd like him to tell
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:23.960]  about you know how they send in these really attractive drug reps and they basically you
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:29.160]  know make you sell these drugs and that's fine but you can't text a patient this is how warped
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:33.880]  the system is it's totally totally insane uh doctor group do you want to share a story about
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:39.720]  how far the drug reps will go well it's all controlled is what it is i mean it's breaking
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:45.080]  out of that control mechanism i mean everything is controlled the doctors are it's the way they're
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:50.360]  trained i mean they're not trained in the root cause of disease i mean i i know i went through
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:54.920]  multiple types of training i spend my whole life trying to figure out how to reverse all this and
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:42:00.920]  how to share with people the answers that they need and one thing nobody talks about is how do
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:06.200]  you how do all these chemicals and everything get in the body to start disease well they all
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:12.040]  float around in water you know how many doctors have you heard talk about disease is associated
[01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:17.640]  with toxic water not many of them because every living substance on the planet including the
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:23.400]  earth itself is composed of at least 80 water if you were to suck all the water out of your body
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:28.360]  you would just lay flat on the ground and think about all the hundred trillion cells in your
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:34.040]  body what what makes a cell round what makes a cell round is this filled with water inside
[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:39.000]  and it's filled with water around the outside actually it's filled with seawater pretty much
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:45.800]  considering the fact you have a lot of minerals in there so the mechanism is to contaminate the
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:52.040]  water what is air that we breathe it's mostly water a lot of times what are the oceans water
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:59.880]  so they know by contaminating the water and also how do electrical signals transfer in the brain
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:05.880]  and in the body if you don't have the proper elect you know electrical water system in your body
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:11.320]  and you throw aluminum into it or mercury into it or any of the other toxic chemicals or metals
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:17.080]  then the water is going to be you're not going to be able to fire those electrical signals
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:24.280]  properly so really if you break it all down and you look at why the mechanism that the agenda the
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:29.880]  healthcare agenda of of creating illness and sickness so they could make all the money it
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:35.400]  really has to do if you boil it all down to one thing is contaminating the water and that's why
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:39.880]  they put neurotoxins in the water supply and that's why they don't want you to have iodine they took
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:45.480]  all the iodine out of the salt because it neutralizes some of that fluoridation and that's why they
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:49.880]  just put all of the garbage now not just the fluoride they they managed to justify that
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:54.920]  all of the garbage now just goes straight into the water supply and he Dr. Grip you're talking
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:44:00.920]  about water on a cellular level which is so so specific if even it's just altered in just a small
[01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:05.720]  way your entire body will suffer in your cells in many cases they can die cellular death right
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:12.040]  yeah i mean a good a good researcher in water was Masaru Emoto and he did studies and he took
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:16.840]  a a water droplet should look like a snowflake under a microscope when you phrase it it should
[01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:22.520]  have six sides and that's a crystal it's like a semiconductor semiconductor is something that
[01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:27.880]  you know can receive signals and transmit signals and that's if you look at the cell
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:33.560]  ourselves they're really lined with semiconductors or gates or channels you know information can
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:40.920]  come in and out and what Masaru Emoto did was he put chemicals in water and took a picture of it
[01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:47.640]  and showed that when water was exposed to chemicals it broke that crystal up and all it
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:55.320]  all it looked like was contaminated water so if you it was all brown and muddy i've seen some of
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:45:01.000]  the photos and muddy and then not only that but he took it a step further and he said found out
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:06.600]  that words can affect water he found out that sound can affect water he found out that thoughts
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:11.720]  can affect water and one of the things he found out that affects water more than anything else
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:17.800]  was the effects of electromagnetic radiation so if an electric magnetic radiation can break
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:23.160]  and keep that crystalline structure of the water in your body and on the planet in a broken state
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:30.360]  well guess what i mean your body is going to go down the stairs of health every day instead of
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:35.240]  up the stairs of health and people can debate you know whether or not the depth of our thoughts
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:38.920]  and everything inside of our bodies and stressors and everything affects the way that the cells
[01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:44.120]  develop and it you know in many ways it obviously does but what is not debatable is that neurotoxins
[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:49.400]  and radiation do absolutely affect our bodies in the water and and that is indisputable and
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:54.040]  that's why they're two main weapons are of course in many ways emf radiation electromagnetic
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:59.880]  radiation straight up radiation as well but also contaminating the water supply is one of the biggest
[01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:05.720]  things beyond even going into GMOs beyond even going into BPA beyond even going into all of that
[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:10.520]  and that's why we're dedicated to solutions on every single one of those fronts we've studied
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:15.080]  every single one of those fronts with our group with others looking at it okay the water supply
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:19.880]  is being attacked okay our hormones are being attacked at the BPA okay we're being attacked
[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:24.600]  with the radiation okay we're being attacked with these superbugs that sometimes are being let out
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:29.240]  of these labs are developed in one way or another every single front we're researching this and
[01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:33.320]  analyzing it and coming up with solutions some you could do at home some you know you can use
[01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:37.320]  key herbs and everything like that every single front it's important to look at and develop
[01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:42.520]  solutions for yeah I was surprised to see that documentary that we carry here I think it's uh
[01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:46.600]  is it take back your power guys is that the name of it where they were showing some bugs on a leaf
[01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:51.160]  and they were exposing them to smart meter radiation and you'd actually see all the bugs
[01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:57.240]  jerk in unison as this thing was pulsing now of course in Europe and Italy they demand that
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:01.720]  that when they put in smart meters at least they demanded that they run the signal down
[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:08.360]  the wires but here we're doing it with a heavy pulsing of wireless emf why it's not necessary
[01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:12.360]  it's absolutely not you've already got a wire running there so why would they do that wirelessly
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:17.400]  and I used to live in an apartment where they had 20 smart meters clustered on the end department
[01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:23.160]  unit can you imagine living near that but at the same time it's funny because they say it does nothing
[01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:28.200]  look at the birds in India there was an article about the birds in India they had to start
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:32.840]  making it unattractive for them to hang around on cell towers because they were just all dying
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:37.800]  but it's safe it's all safe it's all really good for you everything's good in a coal mine
[01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:41.480]  and we got birds on power wall well I think instead of alarm clocks next to our bed we
[01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:46.600]  should have smart meters yeah right next to our head at all times just like the inserts on all
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:50.600]  the pamphlets watch their cell phones say you can't hold don't hold near your head if you look at it
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:55.960]  read it read your iphone pamphlet it's like hold it 10 inches from your head and don't ever put it
[01:47:55.960 --> 01:48:01.320]  near your ear and don't use it for more than 15 minutes a day it's it's it's all lawyer written
[01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:05.160]  stuff because they know the research they've known it for 20 years that's right and they just want to
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:08.680]  cover themselves because when everyone gets brain cancer and brain tumors and start suing them they'll
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:13.240]  say hey we told we told you it was going to kill you dr. Laura Presley came in and we were talking
[01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:18.680]  about smart meters and she had a a chart showing the amount of radiation that you get from different
[01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:24.040]  makes the phones different models as a smartphone and ipad you know an iphone and it was amazing the
[01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:29.640]  amount of radiation that's putting out there just in a standby mode and so yeah her recommendation
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:33.720]  was to make sure that you put it in sleep you know if you're going to set this and use it as an alarm
[01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:37.320]  clock and and a lot of people look at it the last thing before they go to sleep don't put it in your
[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:42.760]  head yeah don't put it near your head put it in airplane and women stop putting the cell phones
[01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:48.600]  in your bras under your shirts it's not a good idea but dr. group what does this emf on a daily
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:54.120]  basis really do to our bodies what does it really really do well the the most damaging effect that
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:59.720]  it does is it alters the water and the communication between your cells i mean you know if the water
[01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:04.360]  inside your body is heating up and it's shaking around it's you know it might your cells might
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:09.800]  not be able to absorb the calcium in the protein and and the minerals it needs to produce whatever
[01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:17.000]  it's going to produce whether it's a hormone or whether it's a insulin or synovial fluid or whatever
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:23.080]  so not only is it putting radiation in your system which has been known to cause cancer
[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:28.520]  but it's also altering the water substance and something very interesting that i found was
[01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:34.200]  looking at all these toxic uh disease causing agents how are they getting in the body because
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:39.080]  you would think as a medical doctor you would say huh all right well well first of all they
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:44.600]  don't make the link that all these toxins are coming in to the body but i was like how are these
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:49.640]  things you know how are people getting these into the cells or into the water to begin with
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:54.440]  and something that was really shocking that i found that was a very that is a very closely
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:50:00.840]  guarded secret by big pharma is the fact that 95 percent of these disease took causing toxins
[01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:05.480]  enter your body through your intestinal lining through your small intestine and your large
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:11.400]  intestine which you have about 25 feet of small intestine and about 10 feet of large intestine
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:18.360]  we have so many problems with intestinal disorders right now that it's rampant even from the time
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:24.040]  kids are born they're constipated you know you have ibs you have bloating you have gas you
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:30.440]  have everything but regardless of what you're taking in your body the root cause of disease
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:35.960]  or the the entry point of all these chemicals especially since the gmo's are burning holes
[01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:41.720]  through the intestinal lining is all these undigested food particles and toxins are going
[01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:47.880]  straight directly into the bloodstream and then the body is having a hard time breaking them down
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:53.480]  and the bodies are developing and storing these toxins in different types of organs
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:57.560]  ultimately stay with us we're going to be right back with dr group and alex is going to join us

[01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:25.320]  dr group and we were just talking about toxins and emf and the effects that they have on our lives
[01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:30.440]  and about what we can do about it what can we do about it dr group how do we defend ourselves how
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:35.640]  do we take control of our health of our family's health well the first thing is to be educated
[01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:40.520]  about it you know obviously listen to alex and listening to all of us and and learning about
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:46.040]  well going through your kitchen and learning about what the chemicals are that you're putting in your
[01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:50.760]  body and then also you know paying attention you know we've done a lot of research in developing
[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:58.360]  the survival shield x2 and the info wars product line info wars live product line over there using
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:04.280]  you know very state-of-the-art equipment and processing technologies that we're going to
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:09.320]  be showing you some behind the scenes footage of fairly soon and i'll be talking through some of
[01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:16.120]  those videos but the best thing people can do is to drink clean water number one drink clean water
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:22.120]  and i always add organic apple cider vinegar in there raw organic apple cider vinegar right here
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:28.200]  if you want to look at some of the things that we're doing especially with iodine that's one
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:34.520]  of the most important substances that i've found that can help restore your health because there's
[01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:42.680]  so many conditions of hypothyroidism out there there's so many conditions of iodine deficiency
[01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:50.040]  so what we do how we start with that is we get the purest iodine crystals that you can find
[01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:55.800]  from deep in the earth like anthony was talking about earlier and these are high high purity
[01:55:55.800 --> 01:56:02.760]  that's 99.99 percent pure iodine crystals now let's be clear though that is the only
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:09.800]  that is the highest purity grade in the world right now and you're the only one for providing that
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:16.440]  yes it is we've gone through to a great extent to be able to solidify this source because
[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:21.480]  we test every batch of iodine that's coming in as well to make sure it's pure to make sure there's
[01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:27.000]  no radiation in it some of the other companies out there are using iodine from sea sources and i'm
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:31.240]  not saying that could be contaminated but with everything that's happening with Fukushima right
[01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:40.840]  now and Fukushima pretty much going critical and you know whether it's from a sea source it can be
[01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:46.120]  good if it's pure but we've made the decision right now to transfer to this key process where it is
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:52.040]  seven to ten thousand feet below the earth and it's interesting now how amid all of this we just
[01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:56.680]  looked at this with Dr. Group and found this to be the key thing but it's interesting now all these
[01:56:56.680 --> 01:57:01.160]  stories coming out from the World Health Organization and others such as this one that just came
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:06.440]  out pregnant women need iodine supplement doctors say but they don't tell you what kind of iodine
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:12.440]  to take they give you the you know bad iodine the iodine that is better than nothing that the
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:17.320]  government is hoarding but overall you can't be taking on a daily basis you know they give you
[01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:21.560]  potassium iodide and that's not something you want to be taking on a daily basis to protect
[01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:25.240]  yourself it's something that you only want to take if you're seeing a mushroom cloud come up
[01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:30.840]  right right yeah or if you're just fill up the thyroid so that you don't absorb the radiation
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:34.760]  so quickly into your thyroid exactly it's a blocking mechanism it's a blocking mechanism
[01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:39.480]  are you could argue really that with all the sodium fluoride in the water supply that it's
[01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:43.720]  basically like we're seeing a mushroom cloud right now and it could be beneficial and it's better
[01:57:43.720 --> 01:57:49.560]  than nothing but we weren't satisfied with better than nothing so we had to go with the real serious
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:53.160]  nascent iodine from the actual crystals deep within the earth and now we've transferred to
[01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:58.840]  this whole new process and what Dr. Group was saying is basically this is the front line of defense
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:03.320]  against the toxins that are going into your body this is the front line of defense we found according
[01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:07.640]  to the research according to the experts the front line and that is why it is called survival
[01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:13.000]  shield and now we have x2 and we're going to be showing the crystals on on screen at prismplin.tv
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:17.160]  or info wars.com slash show and some of the other processes as well yeah if you're watching the video
[01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:21.320]  feed we've got some shots there from the laboratory and we're going to be talking to Dr. Group when
[01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:25.960]  we come back he's going to show us a little bit of the processes there we've already seen some
[01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:30.920]  shots of that iodine that are getting from 7 000 feet below the earth say tune we're going to be
[01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:45.000]  right back and alex is going to be joining us stay with us this is gcn the genesis communications
[01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:53.000]  radio network this is scottish john for info wars.com i know that most of you here in this
[01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:57.800]  commercial already know about the new world order eugenics and all the other issues covered here at
[01:58:57.800 --> 01:59:03.400]  info wars the question is do your friends and family know if not then i want to know why oh i
[01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:07.560]  know it's tough to talk about this with some people they might call you names or they just want to
[01:59:07.560 --> 01:59:13.320]  talk about sports are so poppers i say so what there's a battle going on out there right now
[01:59:13.320 --> 01:59:18.600]  the ammunition is information and the soldiers are you it's time to transform your game from
[01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:23.400]  passive listener to active participant we from scotland have had our skin in this game for the
[01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:28.200]  greater part of the last thousand years and i'm still fighting if we don't all stand up right
[01:59:28.200 --> 01:59:33.560]  now we're going to lose everything the info war is worldwide tell your friends about info wars
[01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:38.760]  and let them know that info wars doesn't print bull it's real journalism and news backed up by
[01:59:38.760 --> 01:59:45.080]  documented fact step up and take your friends and family to info wars.com prisonplanet.tv
[01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:48.760]  and planetinfowars.com the truth will set them free
[01:59:52.280 --> 01:59:57.480]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:12.680]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:21.640]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:30.360]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night here in austin joined with anthony gucci
[02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:35.080]  already here in the studio we have dr group at his lab and he's going to take us around and show
[02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:39.720]  us a little bit of what's there we've been seeing pictures of the crystals they've got a very good
[02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:45.080]  source of iodine from taken from 7000 feet below the earth's surface why because they want to make
[02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:52.440]  sure that it's not contaminated with radiation from fukushima many sources of iodine use seawater
[02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:56.040]  or they're taken from a shallow area where it could be contaminated so they get it from very
[02:00:56.040 --> 02:01:01.160]  deep below the surface they test it with a for radiation presence and we've just been talking
[02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:07.560]  to him about solutions to the toxins and the emf that you come across in your in your life i mean
[02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:13.720]  he's talking about how those things affect you negatively and dr group what can you tell us about
[02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:18.040]  the lab there about the process and let's just be clear this isn't just about iodine the reason
[02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:23.000]  this lab is so key and the reason why dr group is so key is because as they go around prescribing
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:27.240]  people antidepressant drugs they're also shutting down natural manufacturers that have super high
[02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:33.160]  quality grade manufacturing techniques yes dr group's lab is literally a jewel of the natural
[02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:38.520]  health industry it is the best is the highest state of the art we should be thankful it exists
[02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:43.400]  and we should fight for it so anyway thank you dr group well thanks yeah this is behind the
[02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:48.600]  scenes footage and this is very rare because most manufacturing facilities will not let you back
[02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:54.520]  behind closed doors because we're so transparent and because we want to show people you know the
[02:01:54.520 --> 02:02:02.120]  whole processing we want to show how effective it is this footage is made available exclusively to
[02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:08.840]  the infowars life team and infowars customers so right here what you're going to see is you're
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:16.520]  going to see the iodine production room as you can see we use all glass vessels you'll see a
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:22.360]  vessel mixing the actual iodine and this is very rare you know these vessels are extremely expensive
[02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:29.800]  they're made of borosilicate glass i'm going to tell you from touring hundreds of manufacturing
[02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:37.080]  facilities in the past that nobody hardly ever uses full glass vessels they use stainless steel
[02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:43.400]  which can be contaminated and especially when you're dealing with iodine is a oxidizing substance
[02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:49.480]  you want to make sure that it's done in all glass so it's a lot harder to do everything here is made
[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:57.160]  by hand i'm going to take you over to the quarantine room here which is where all the ingredients come
[02:02:57.160 --> 02:03:02.200]  in you know this is very important because they all have to be tested they all have to be approved
[02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:07.000]  they have to be tested for microbes and make sure they're clean it's what we ordered before
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:11.880]  they're released from quarantine and when they're released from quarantine then they can start going
[02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:18.440]  into production the next thing that i'll show you is the v blending room and this is how you
[02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:26.600]  actually mix the powders the infowars life team is going to be introducing some really high tech
[02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:33.880]  product encapsulated products here very shortly that we're working on and this blender is how you
[02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:40.520]  actually blend effectively uh if you have eight or nine ingredients in a product you would need
[02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:46.520]  them equally mixed and so this is how you do it the right way right here this looks like something
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:53.720]  from a futuristic movie from 2099 or something yeah that's really it's really cool after it gets
[02:03:53.720 --> 02:04:01.640]  blended it goes all into encapsulation now the encapsulation room we have individuals in there
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:07.480]  that are doing it by hand on semi-automatic encapsulators you know this is what you any
[02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:12.600]  capsule that you take i mean any capsule that you see or that you get from any vitamin store
[02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:18.040]  anything like that this is the process that it goes through if it's done in a cgmp
[02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:25.000]  uh certified or and many are client facility i think you're downplaying yourself you use
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:30.120]  silica glass because you don't want to get uh man metals to contaminate the actual everything
[02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:35.240]  you're producing but specifically a lot of the capsules come from china and that's why they're
[02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:41.080]  toxic you know this is actually made in america super high quality cgmp certified doctor groups
[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:45.400]  laboratory fascinating pictures there we're going to be right back and alex jones is going to be
[02:04:45.400 --> 02:04:55.400]  joining us in the next segment so stay with us
[02:05:00.200 --> 02:05:07.400]  hi i'm dr edward group it took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the
[02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:15.560]  highest purity iodine available the new survival shield x2 is mined from seven to ten thousand
[02:05:15.560 --> 02:05:22.760]  feet below the earth in pristine environmentally clean conditions the iodine crystals we use are
[02:05:22.760 --> 02:05:31.880]  extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth it's the strongest

[02:07:06.360 --> 02:07:10.440]  several years ago matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment frustrated with the direction
[02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:15.400]  this country was headed and the charlottes willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take
[02:07:15.400 --> 02:07:21.560]  action a company run by patriots for patriots was born by patriot supply has never taken a loan
[02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:27.400]  or accepted outside funding they now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard
[02:07:27.400 --> 02:07:32.520]  working american men and women it is rare to find companies who practice what they preach and that's

[02:08:22.200 --> 02:08:27.640]  anthony gucciardi here with me in the studio we've been talking to dr group at his lab he's been
[02:08:27.640 --> 02:08:32.520]  giving us kind of an audio tour and a lot of that maybe doesn't translate as well on radio as it
[02:08:32.520 --> 02:08:37.160]  showed it pretty amazing equipment i have this gigantic v-shaped thing i look like a tesla
[02:08:37.160 --> 02:08:42.680]  anti-gravity machine or something i don't know i know and what's amazing is what he's doing is he's
[02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:46.600]  basically going beyond organic quality standards and like i said earlier it's not just about the
[02:08:46.600 --> 02:08:51.400]  iodine it's not just about the products the fact is that there's virtually no other factory doing
[02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:56.440]  this to these standards the purity of everything he's doing and we should appreciate that even if
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:09:00.840]  we're looking outside of you know the amazing nutraceuticals that he's producing because the
[02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:07.160]  fda absolutely hates the nutraceutical companies that really are doing the right thing and in
[02:09:07.160 --> 02:09:11.960]  reality that's why we also see a lot of these companies offshoring their work to china where
[02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:15.720]  the manufacturing process is dirty and full of contaminants and stuff like that do you think
[02:09:15.720 --> 02:09:19.560]  in china they really have a quarantine area where they bring new materials in until they make sure
[02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:24.360]  they're claimed uh or did they give everything to us do they even use stainless steel i mean
[02:09:24.360 --> 02:09:28.840]  yeah one of the videos uh group was showing has a containment area where every single thing he was
[02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:33.800]  bringing in he was testing not only for radiation everything but for other items as well and there's
[02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:38.280]  actually a chain link fence around it and it's locked with a deadbolt type lock no one's even
[02:09:38.280 --> 02:09:43.880]  allowed to go in there that it's just to separate the super pure products from anything that's new
[02:09:43.880 --> 02:09:47.720]  and untested yet and anything that's tested and it's it's below the standards which are basically
[02:09:47.720 --> 02:09:53.160]  zero zero zero across the board um it's discarded them or sent or sent back yeah let's look we've
[02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:56.280]  got Dr. Group on the line while he's still with us Dr. Group anything else you want to tell us
[02:09:56.280 --> 02:10:00.920]  about your laboratory there and recap on basically the health solutions and what we can do as you're
[02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:06.600]  explaining to reclaim our health and to as you were saying the water in our bodies needs to be
[02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:12.040]  cleansed and detoxed or else we'll never achieve optimum health okay well let me just go back to
[02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:17.480]  the facility yes we try to do everything as organic as possible i mean we even had to find
[02:10:17.480 --> 02:10:23.960]  VOC free organic epoxy coatings that were FDA approved and had to go through some of the approval
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:30.840]  processes for the epoxy flooring on the floor the paint on the walls is organic clay paint i mean
[02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:36.520]  everything from the ground up at our facility is organic and chemical free one thing we didn't
[02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:42.520]  show you is the liquid processing room you're going to get that on the screen right there that's very
[02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:51.160]  high tech and of course there's all of the FDA standards in any type of processing room
[02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:56.760]  we have to ensure that those are there and it stacks and stacks and stacks of paperwork that we
[02:10:56.760 --> 02:11:02.040]  have to fill out to make sure everything is clean properly with non-toxic cleaners you know most
[02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:06.920]  companies like what you were talking about in china they use toxic chemical cleaning products
[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:13.160]  ours are omri listed another big factor is what you're going to see is the distillation room the
[02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:19.720]  distillation room we use triple distilled water that's a big water distiller right there and it
[02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:25.160]  takes again for radio listeners basically you explain that explain that the purpose of the
[02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:30.600]  triple distilled water and why you distilled three times well the triple distilled water is an
[02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:36.680]  ultra pure energy enhanced water i mean as the more you distill water it actually changes its
[02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:41.720]  structure at the third the sixth and the ninth distillation so if you look at any of the great
[02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:47.320]  chemists from years and years ago or even the alchemists from the 1600s they would always ensure
[02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:53.320]  using triple distilled water because even distilled water might have some contaminants or it might
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:57.560]  not be as pure as possible because that's right but i mean bottom line here alex jones just jumping
[02:11:57.560 --> 02:12:04.280]  in because i'm about to come in with a bunch of news in this hour here on this live friday edition
[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:10.040]  with the great crew david knight and of course and the gucciardi hosting the show in the first
[02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:18.040]  two hours with the doctor group out in arizona i'm here in south texas truly 21st century radio
[02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:26.040]  slash tv that beyond the fact that groups been so careful to have the purest products it's also
[02:12:26.040 --> 02:12:33.160]  what's even more important the big issue here is that no one has this type of pure crystal based
[02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:38.840]  iodine that we've been showing people on the nightly news and this is literally the big
[02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:44.360]  conspiracy with the globalist to put everything else in that same area of the periodic table
[02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:50.600]  the you know the fluorines the bromide all of it that blocks the iodine the government before it
[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:56.360]  was pure evil at the top said put iodine in the salt the public needs it in the 20s took it out
[02:12:56.360 --> 02:13:02.440]  in the 60s this is the big issue so that's why we're funding our operation while promoting something
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:07.000]  that everybody needs it's a win win win like we find the operation with high quality water
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:11.720]  filtration because it's so important dr. strange love you know the famous movie by stanley kubrick
[02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:16.120]  they make jokes about precious bodily fluids but actually kubrick was telling people through a joke
[02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:20.920]  what was really going on in that film and i've talked to his family on air folks but nobody
[02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:25.240]  else has been able to so so that's the bottom line i just wanted to come on dr. group and thank
[02:13:25.240 --> 02:13:29.400]  you for having us up to your great laboratory wanted to thank rob do for the great job he's

[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:40.520]  the nightly news showing the amazing crystals the crystal gas you name it that is so amazing and

[02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:18.520]  job and again we've got so much to cover today as we start this new hour so much has already
[02:14:18.520 --> 02:14:22.760]  been covered i've been listening during almost the entire broadcast all the different angles
[02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:29.400]  that have been covered i want to get into the naked tyranny that we're facing as a civilization
[02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:35.480]  and just how obvious it's all getting here in just a moment but before i do that and go to all
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:42.120]  the stories that are up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com i wanted to have david night
[02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:48.040]  uh and of course antony uti already put bookends on any other key points that were made in the
[02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:53.640]  last two hours top stories that you guys think should be recapped and then i'm going to plow
[02:14:53.640 --> 02:15:00.520]  right into the public takeover of our children by the state this is this is incredible on so many
[02:15:00.520 --> 02:15:05.800]  fronts we're going to break down the top story red links from info wars dot com well you know alex
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:10.680]  it seems like michigan is an area where they really are bringing in the police state total control
[02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:16.360]  we've seen them go in and execute uh free range hogs and uh in michigan not hogs i mean they're
[02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:23.560]  domestically these are these are farmers raising a strain of pork these are domesticated hogs being
[02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:29.160]  killed because the strain is seen by their bureau of land management in the state uh as one that is
[02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:34.600]  basically uh seen as a feral variant even though it's the exact same genetics as a regular domesticated
[02:15:34.600 --> 02:15:40.440]  european crossbred hybrid hog exactly and and cracking down on many farms they're now of course
[02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:46.040]  it doesn't really come as any surprise that it's michigan again that is coming after the
[02:15:46.040 --> 02:15:52.360]  adolescence just enacting this michigan medical records law for all children 12 to 17 you take
[02:15:52.360 --> 02:15:56.360]  them for any medical appointment and they say there's no way to opt out of this they're going to
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:16:01.880]  take your children away and they're going to interview them to give them information about
[02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:07.560]  sexual items and and probably to bring them back to the hospital and then they're going to
[02:16:07.560 --> 02:16:13.640]  uh sexual items and and probably to pry into your family a lot of times that takes a direction
[02:16:13.640 --> 02:16:17.800]  in these discussions where they might come back and misconstrue something that's innocent and come
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:21.800]  after the parents to try to take their children away this is something we're seeing in michigan
[02:16:21.800 --> 02:16:27.400]  and yet at the same time in tennessee we see a sheriff who's being investigated actually not
[02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:31.240]  investigated there's there's a journalist who thinks there's something going on in his prison
[02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:36.280]  asked for a freedom of information request and then he gets investigated by this sheriff
[02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:41.320]  intimidated so that's what we're really seeing everywhere people realize this total surveillance
[02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:46.680]  state where we have no privacy uh where we have everything in our life examined under a microscope
[02:16:46.680 --> 02:16:51.000]  but we can't get any information from this government and at the same time the uh the v a
[02:16:52.040 --> 02:16:58.520]  association authority is having veterans dying on list waiting to get medical care we see 18 of
[02:16:58.520 --> 02:17:02.360]  them died in just phoenix and that ties into what we were talking about earlier people on lists
[02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:07.800]  being rejected care but beyond that with the private screenings of these 17-year-old girls and below
[02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:13.000]  they go in and we were talking to dr group earlier it's no different than a really really evil used
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:17.800]  car dealership where they're putting these people on these medications not just to make a profit
[02:17:17.800 --> 02:17:21.320]  even though the government and the pharmaceutical companies are funding all the studies that say
[02:17:21.320 --> 02:17:27.160]  all americans are mentally ill but that's the new freedom initiative what we have is a corporate
[02:17:27.160 --> 02:17:32.920]  globalist government that's anti-human with no special interest groups for the general public
[02:17:32.920 --> 02:17:38.600]  for our basic rights that are making it the law that we buy their products and their services
[02:17:38.600 --> 02:17:43.800]  that are basically slavery that's what obama care is is literal predominant foreign banks
[02:17:43.800 --> 02:17:50.600]  that own the insurance companies getting a multi-thousand-page 13 000 pages of writer bill past
[02:17:50.600 --> 02:17:56.680]  that says they can triple quadruple your prices cut your care force you to buy it raise taxes on
[02:17:56.680 --> 02:18:01.560]  poor people and this is held as liberal because the front man of it is supposedly black now
[02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:07.240]  i want to shift gears when we come back from the break into the actual story itself because it's
[02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:13.160]  one of those type stories that's a rosetta stone into every major angle that we've been talking
[02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:19.480]  about that people should become totally outraged about it's redlinked on info wars dot com new
[02:18:19.480 --> 02:18:25.960]  medical law mandates private conversations with child before they visit doctor and of course this
[02:18:25.960 --> 02:18:31.240]  is breaking out of several states michigan among them but as soon as i read this early this morning
[02:18:32.200 --> 02:18:38.360]  when paul watson posted at about seven a.m i went wait a minute this isn't just a limited tip we
[02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:43.000]  got out of michigan and the confirmation they're posting signs saying we're going to call your kids
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:46.840]  aside never secret conversation with them when you bring them in for their checkup
[02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:51.880]  just training you that the state takes your kids away like a tsa does this is beyond medical
[02:18:51.880 --> 02:18:57.880]  tyranny beyond state run medical systems this is going on all over the country and is a federal
[02:18:57.880 --> 02:19:03.320]  mandate and so i googled it today and sure enough you can go back six years at least
[02:19:03.320 --> 02:19:08.680]  doctors calling kids over and asking about mommy and daddy's guns they're teaching psychologists
[02:19:08.680 --> 02:19:13.800]  psychiatrists that guns might as well be illegal that any parent that owns guns is mentally ill
[02:19:13.800 --> 02:19:19.720]  so this is the tyranny this is state run medicine and it must be rebelled against at every level
[02:19:19.720 --> 02:19:26.120]  doctors and pediatricians and clinic workers that are against it need to speak out because this is
[02:19:26.120 --> 02:19:32.280]  turning them into government spy social workers when the government has the history of the criminal
[02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:37.400]  testing the criminal actions six to seven times more likely to be abused in government care as a
[02:19:37.400 --> 02:19:43.240]  child in any other group look it up so we're going to break it all down straight ahead on this friday

[02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:33.080]  so part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their
[02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:37.320]  parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities
[02:24:37.320 --> 02:24:41.800]  once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households then we start making better
[02:24:41.800 --> 02:24:51.240]  investments if you think i'll sit around the government says as the world goes by you're
[02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:56.520]  thinking like a fool because all it takes is you and i out there is a world of slaves to be
[02:24:56.520 --> 02:25:01.000]  taken over and told what to do and talk they're little and powerless and that's what we'll do
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:07.240]  at the new world order well if they think that i'm going to sit around while they enslave humanity
[02:25:07.240 --> 02:25:13.480]  they've got another thing coming alex jones here live uh riding shotgun with me of course
[02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:20.120]  or david night and think it's already another great host of info wars nightly news now i remember
[02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:24.680]  this started really decades ago but it was creeping and it would back off every time it happened
[02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:29.240]  but you would have pediatrician psychologist school nurses you name it
[02:25:30.680 --> 02:25:36.200]  call the swat team on dad because he had a gun case and you know the 13 year old from a rural
[02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:40.360]  community would move into the city and tell their new school counselor i actually remember
[02:25:40.360 --> 02:25:45.000]  covering this like 15 years ago it was a real case that no i'm allowed to get in and get the guns
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:50.360]  and so a swat team was called but it was totally legal and lawful for a 13 year old
[02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:54.680]  trained with firearms to get into the firearms case they've been trained to use them i mean i
[02:25:54.680 --> 02:26:00.840]  grew up like that but it it goes to the mentality of brainwashing the public as the attorney general
[02:26:00.840 --> 02:26:08.840]  eric holder said against guns to where there is the perception that you own guns you must be a criminal
[02:26:08.840 --> 02:26:16.120]  now that's what's going on we actually know what pediatricians what medical doctors what
[02:26:16.120 --> 02:26:21.960]  dentists what oral surgeons what orthodontist are being recruited to do because it's been in the
[02:26:21.960 --> 02:26:28.440]  news and my father last year homeland security tried to recruit him and then he asked around
[02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:35.240]  and every dentist he knew had been either visited at their offices or at their homes by dhs and it
[02:26:35.240 --> 02:26:40.520]  was to be political officers it was well what do you mean i mean i'd call the police anyways
[02:26:40.520 --> 02:26:44.520]  if a patient was saying something criminal that they were planning to do i have a responsibility
[02:26:44.520 --> 02:26:54.040]  to do that and they'd say no no no there's no more patient doctor privilege on stuff that
[02:26:54.040 --> 02:26:59.320]  isn't even illegal you have a duty to tell us if they don't like the government or they talk
[02:26:59.320 --> 02:27:04.600]  about about the irs and my dad thought they were trying to set him up and he said what do you think
[02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:08.760]  i ought to do and i said no go ahead and start talking to him and talk to other dentists to
[02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:16.120]  find out more and he found out no they didn't even know that david jones was my dad this long
[02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:22.520]  time patient of his with the dhs who was playing spy they didn't even know that and they had already
[02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:27.720]  gone to dr king and his office and others that same week so he called other dentists he knew
[02:27:27.720 --> 02:27:34.280]  and they said no we're getting visits sometimes by fbi agents at their homes so you have a
[02:27:34.280 --> 02:27:39.480]  total recruitment like the scosy would do in east germany i mean this is so authoritarian it's over
[02:27:39.480 --> 02:27:45.320]  the top two days ago holder announced homeland security offices in every small town in big city
[02:27:45.320 --> 02:27:51.000]  looking for homegrown terrorists pre-crime so you see an article at info wars dot com like new
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:58.840]  medical law mandates private conversations with child before every doctor visit parental authority
[02:27:58.840 --> 02:28:08.200]  being eviscerated by the state and this gets into what's happening in michigan and christine duffy
[02:28:08.200 --> 02:28:12.360]  brought her 17-year-old daughter to the physician's office for a minor foot injury she was told the
[02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:16.840]  new medical access law required a nurse to have a private conversation with her child another
[02:28:16.840 --> 02:28:20.840]  example of her out parental authorities being eviscerated by the state folks they do this to
[02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:26.200]  five-year-olds i've had three children with a doctor i know in north austin and a nice hospital
[02:28:26.200 --> 02:28:31.240]  now she's a listener a great lady didn't matter every time we get called in the nurse says will
[02:28:31.240 --> 02:28:35.640]  you bring this file downstairs mr. jones and and and then when i go downstairs she says you know do
[02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:40.600]  you have enough money does he beat you and they're not telling my wife all this is happening it's
[02:28:40.600 --> 02:28:44.680]  being put in a computer database where if she says they don't have enough money the kids are being
[02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:50.360]  taken okay you're not being told you have a right to remain silent everything will you know be used
[02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:54.040]  against you in a court of law they've gotten rid of maranda spring court ruled eight years ago
[02:28:54.040 --> 02:28:59.400]  and again the state acts like it's doing all this to take care of us this is the same government
[02:28:59.400 --> 02:29:03.560]  caught doing thousands and thousands of secret tests killing thousands of people per test in
[02:29:03.560 --> 02:29:09.800]  some cases microwaving radiating foster kids giving black people syphilis just a few years ago turning
[02:29:09.800 --> 02:29:16.520]  the oxygen off to babies okay this is the criminal globalist it's not like they're doing this and
[02:29:16.520 --> 02:29:20.680]  being authoritarian for own good that's always the excuse no it's just like in every other case
[02:29:20.680 --> 02:29:25.000]  it's because they want total power now the good news is the average doctor the average cop the average
[02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:31.880]  social worker isn't even bad yet but under centralization they're bringing in the computerized
[02:29:31.880 --> 02:29:37.240]  orders to them where they follow forms where they don't have any discretion they're like robots
[02:29:37.240 --> 02:29:41.800]  biological robots that come out and enforce all this we're going to break it down and tie it into
[02:29:41.800 --> 02:29:47.000]  third world countries where it's already being done as well like india you name it it's all

[02:33:28.280 --> 02:33:38.200]  we know throughout history over and over again the patterns of authoritarian states follow
[02:33:38.200 --> 02:33:45.960]  the surveillance the forced drugging the propaganda the worship of the system the state claiming
[02:33:45.960 --> 02:33:52.200]  that it's god and that and that only you know its needs should be met everyone else can basically
[02:33:52.200 --> 02:33:58.680]  starve to death or die for the state well now the state in their own word is the bankers
[02:33:59.320 --> 02:34:02.920]  not your banker down the street that's integral to the economy and helps loan money
[02:34:02.920 --> 02:34:07.400]  which is fine the banker that's the mega globalist that issues the currency and credit
[02:34:07.400 --> 02:34:13.240]  that can create a thousand five hundred trillion globally in the last 20 years of derivatives and
[02:34:13.240 --> 02:34:23.400]  then sign the people the world onto it true slavery my friends is nigeria if you can go look up the
[02:34:23.400 --> 02:34:27.800]  phase of loans they got starting in the 60s getting a two billion dollar loan than a four
[02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:34.600]  billion dollar loan in the 80s and paying last time i checked more than 40 billion on one two
[02:34:34.600 --> 02:34:40.520]  billion dollar loan and more than 60 billion on the other loan i know it was close to a hundred
[02:34:40.520 --> 02:34:46.440]  billion dollars they've paid on less than 10 billion dollars in loans hundred billion dollars
[02:34:47.400 --> 02:34:53.080]  on less than 10 billion dollars and they're in greater debt than they ever were they can never
[02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:59.080]  get out of it and the globalist fully control the nation that's what we're going under in america
[02:34:59.080 --> 02:35:03.320]  and nigeria never had a history of freedom venezuelan's never had a history of freedom
[02:35:04.120 --> 02:35:08.280]  but america's not been perfect but it's been the model of freedom because you did have more freedom
[02:35:08.280 --> 02:35:14.680]  here on the economic index in the last 240 years than you've had in any other country now we're
[02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:21.240]  dwarfed now by places like switzerland and luxembourg but those are globalist command bases that they
[02:35:21.240 --> 02:35:26.680]  leave somewhat free for themselves as to get out of jail free card and you can't move there unless
[02:35:26.680 --> 02:35:32.200]  you're stinking rich i can't move to switzerland folks i couldn't move to switzerland i couldn't
[02:35:32.200 --> 02:35:40.120]  get into switzerland so you need to understand something ladies and gentlemen this is a rigged
[02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:44.840]  game and i i talk about this constantly because if we don't realize it's rigged and that's the true
[02:35:44.840 --> 02:35:52.440]  form of discrimination and stop fighting over what color we are it's over it's over and david knight
[02:35:52.440 --> 02:35:55.960]  we're going to talk more about this in about 10 minutes but i wanted him to show the article first
[02:35:55.960 --> 02:36:02.840]  and just mention it here's bloomberg today saying in venezuela they sacrifice drinking water and
[02:36:02.840 --> 02:36:11.880]  medicine to pay bankers notice hugo chavez is gone but he paid the bankers and the bankers
[02:36:11.880 --> 02:36:16.680]  always fund communist and socialist fake revolutions i'll guarantee you that they're in control of
[02:36:16.680 --> 02:36:22.680]  that guy and they're in control of his new replacement and david show folks that article
[02:36:22.680 --> 02:36:28.120]  because this ties into parents having no rights and the state saying your kids belong to us
[02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:34.200]  this is the exact system of where we have no rights only the government and the corporations
[02:36:34.200 --> 02:36:39.400]  have rights right out of james conne's rollerball david knight oh yeah absolutely alex they've got
[02:36:39.400 --> 02:36:44.520]  a quote even here from my barkley's banker who says the government's priority is to pay the
[02:36:44.520 --> 02:36:50.600]  sovereign debt now he's saying that even as they say in the article 42 people have died because
[02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:56.920]  of food and medicine shortages since february so this is not something that is just limited to
[02:36:56.920 --> 02:37:01.800]  this particular government they point out that under hugo chavez they said he kept up this is
[02:37:01.800 --> 02:37:07.080]  bloomberg reporting this bloomberg dot com they say hugo chavez kept up payments to bondholders
[02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:16.360]  allowing them to reap returns of 692 percent during his 14-year tenure almost 700 profits
[02:37:16.360 --> 02:37:20.520]  for these bankers while his people are suffering economic hardship to the point of not even
[02:37:20.520 --> 02:37:25.880]  having water and trying to cross the border to get water and medicine absolutely we're gonna cover
[02:37:25.880 --> 02:37:31.480]  that more coming up in a few minutes but but here's the issue obama care is not obama care i love
[02:37:31.480 --> 02:37:35.960]  to call it that because he's unpopular i can tie this monstrosity to him and hopefully we can beat
[02:37:35.960 --> 02:37:41.800]  it but the globalists have passed the similar laws all over the world and when you see something
[02:37:41.800 --> 02:37:49.000]  like venezuela and 600 plus percent profits for the banksters they come in put a dictatorship in
[02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:55.080]  even before he got in power and then when he continued and have them give them sweetheart deals
[02:37:55.080 --> 02:38:01.080]  where you give us all your roads and water and we only charge you 200 interest every couple years
[02:38:01.720 --> 02:38:09.640]  and then we double the prices that's how so-called privatization works i'd be for real privatization
[02:38:09.640 --> 02:38:16.520]  the problem is governments are so incredibly corrupt over and over again that they are basically
[02:38:16.520 --> 02:38:23.640]  always giving us the biggest screw job because of the complexity of the world the world's so big
[02:38:23.640 --> 02:38:29.000]  we're destroyed by the bigness by the complexity that evil and bureaucracy is able to hide behind
[02:38:29.720 --> 02:38:35.000]  but bottom line you cut government you cut the taxes you give the people more money
[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:40.680]  they can build an economy voting for quality and you've got two different parallel free market
[02:38:40.680 --> 02:38:45.400]  systems running and what's left of that and then you've got the socialism and the and the corporate
[02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:52.040]  fascism above it taking credit for all this good that free market created now think about this this
[02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:56.600]  is not just in michigan and it's a great article when i saw paul watson do it but we'd have another
[02:38:56.600 --> 02:39:02.200]  article maybe monday or something and anybody can go search this you know just type in doctors told
[02:39:02.200 --> 02:39:06.760]  to talk to children about guns and you'll have the white house denying it's going at media matters
[02:39:06.760 --> 02:39:12.360]  but separately you'll have time magazine coming out kids and guns why doctors have a right to know
[02:39:12.360 --> 02:39:18.280]  a federal judge overturns a florida law stating doctors can't ask parents about guns in their
[02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:24.760]  household a law the critics said was a sign of gun rights protection gone too far since when do you
[02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:31.960]  go to a doctor and they're asking about do mommy and daddy smoke pot do mommy and daddy have guns
[02:39:31.960 --> 02:39:37.400]  what do mommy and daddy say or do mommy and daddy not like the government this is what they ask them
[02:39:37.400 --> 02:39:43.560]  they have been turned into secret police most doctors i know don't want to be part of this
[02:39:43.560 --> 02:39:48.840]  they should have a right since when does michelle obama tell kids what they eat again my kids two
[02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:52.520]  years ago went to private school we said i've been homeschooling a while to send them to the christian
[02:39:52.520 --> 02:39:58.120]  private school great private school great people but they're accredited so they would send handouts
[02:39:58.120 --> 02:40:03.480]  back every month with worksheets with michelle obama on them and they would have this this this
[02:40:03.480 --> 02:40:08.200]  training day about food where michelle obama videos were shown about what food they were supposed to
[02:40:08.200 --> 02:40:13.080]  eat and i went and talked to the school and they said we're sorry this is done everywhere
[02:40:13.080 --> 02:40:18.920]  you're a private school accredited they're public schools now folks it doesn't matter this is the
[02:40:18.920 --> 02:40:27.320]  total control and again it's yanesco they set the treaties they set the rules all across the board
[02:40:27.320 --> 02:40:35.080]  to control the society and to control the curriculum and again folks i'm broadcasting from my hotel
[02:40:35.080 --> 02:40:39.960]  room here and there's light blasting through the window bouncing off literally of a pyramid
[02:40:39.960 --> 02:40:46.040]  building across the street uh and uh so i put my sunglasses on sorry if i'm not doing it for
[02:40:46.040 --> 02:40:50.520]  james bondy in effect like the secret service i'm just putting them on because i can't see if
[02:40:50.520 --> 02:40:55.320]  you're watching us on prison planet dot tv or the free feeds for the daily radio show at info wars
[02:40:55.320 --> 02:41:01.400]  dot com forward slash show so this is an absolute screaming war against the people and then in all
[02:41:01.400 --> 02:41:06.920]  the sitcoms the dramas the movies you name it if you don't like the state training your kids at
[02:41:06.920 --> 02:41:11.080]  secret police talk to them constantly or you don't like the tsa training you to take your kid away
[02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:15.560]  where they're groped and psychologists admit it's pedophile training if you don't like the checkpoints
[02:41:15.560 --> 02:41:21.160]  on the highways if you don't like the tea party being demonized as terrorists if you don't like it
[02:41:21.160 --> 02:41:26.920]  you're a weirdo as classical authoritarianism comes in but i noticed when i google search doctors
[02:41:27.960 --> 02:41:34.600]  ask kids about parents guns that i saw media matters huffington post and all of them up top
[02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:42.200]  and snopes run by george soros is connected to that saying there is no program to ask kids about
[02:41:42.200 --> 02:41:46.040]  guns there's no man behind the curtain there is no drone program if you have a business you
[02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:50.840]  didn't build it raising the debt doesn't raise the debt you know two plus two equals five i mean
[02:41:50.840 --> 02:41:57.960]  literally it doesn't exist ladies and gentlemen none of this is happening none of this is going on
[02:41:57.960 --> 02:42:05.720]  none of this is unfolding and then meanwhile from the other side targeting their minions
[02:42:06.760 --> 02:42:14.120]  they're saying oh yes ladies and gentlemen uh of course uh we are uh you know doing all of this
[02:42:14.120 --> 02:42:21.160]  uh you know of course uh you know we've got to ask about the guns for the children's safety
[02:42:21.720 --> 02:42:28.120]  it's for your safety it's no big deal please don't be a conspiracy theorist so again just within
[02:42:28.120 --> 02:42:33.000]  that google search you can see the propaganda because then there's dozens of articles saying yes
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:38.360]  doctor calls the police because a child said he was allowed to shoot guns child was 14
[02:42:39.240 --> 02:42:42.120]  you're totally legal to shoot guns with your parents when you're 14
[02:42:42.120 --> 02:42:44.920]  you can do it when you're seven years old six years old
[02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:52.040]  i know people personally in austin texas where the cps has been involved and tried to take
[02:42:52.040 --> 02:42:58.120]  people's children because they own a ranch and they took the six-year-old the nine-year-old
[02:42:58.120 --> 02:43:06.680]  and the uh 11-year-old out shooting and the state got involved because the kid went and
[02:43:06.680 --> 02:43:11.000]  showed other kids photos of his dad shooting guns and they said you're with your dad shooting
[02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:16.520]  guns and the and the police get involved okay i mean i've told you nothing against them except
[02:43:16.520 --> 02:43:22.760]  they're calling the police on us it's always the same californians think it's cheap to buy
[02:43:24.280 --> 02:43:30.840]  ten acres for five million dollars you could buy ten acres you know around austin uh satan
[02:43:30.840 --> 02:43:37.800]  ripping springs five years ago for maybe uh fifty thousand dollars now it might be
[02:43:37.800 --> 02:43:42.360]  million two million three million dollars because the californians jacked up the prices so much in
[02:43:42.360 --> 02:43:47.880]  their bubble they came here and so there's people with 200 acre thousand acre five hundred acre
[02:43:47.880 --> 02:43:52.120]  farms and ranches that have been there for hundreds of years and literally the californians show up
[02:43:52.120 --> 02:43:57.160]  you shoot your guns this happened to my neighbors by the way all of my neighbors hadn't happened to
[02:43:57.160 --> 02:44:03.960]  me yet and the police come the state police haze county sheriff's department and they say sorry
[02:44:03.960 --> 02:44:07.800]  we're going to go ahead and give you tickets or arrest you just your neighbor was scared well you
[02:44:07.800 --> 02:44:14.920]  know this is america and there is no law but the californians are kings of earth as i've said
[02:44:14.920 --> 02:44:18.680]  because they're they're tagging and in the police state they've got to teach the public the only
[02:44:18.680 --> 02:44:23.480]  power you have is through the state the only power you have is by sickening people on someone
[02:44:25.160 --> 02:44:30.360]  so it is a total takeover of society with the state saying your kids belong to us
[02:44:30.360 --> 02:44:37.160]  and the state saying we're going to take all of your freedoms and it makes me absolutely
[02:44:37.160 --> 02:44:45.160]  completely physically sick to know that it isn't just michigan folks they've been doing this by
[02:44:45.160 --> 02:44:50.600]  stealth just like they've been taking our blood for 41 years worldwide putting in the un database
[02:44:50.600 --> 02:44:55.720]  i'm not bragging on but it is fact i broke it in 1997 when a nurse gave me the secret documents
[02:44:55.720 --> 02:45:02.120]  involved with the u.s army my exposes of it caused families to sue in texas and minnesota
[02:45:02.760 --> 02:45:06.760]  we had the families on in both cases they were listeners remember seeing it in the news starting
[02:45:06.760 --> 02:45:11.480]  about 2002 when the lawsuit started we would call and get the families on they say oh i heard it on
[02:45:11.480 --> 02:45:16.360]  your show went and had a baby um they lied to me about it blah blah blah and then in another suit
[02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:21.880]  the woman later went a decade later had heard about it but after she had kids heard about on
[02:45:21.880 --> 02:45:25.880]  my show went and tried to have dna treatment on one of her kids they said sorry it's going to be
[02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:32.920]  $100,000 per treatment because we patented your specific dna protein well how'd you get my daughter's
[02:45:32.920 --> 02:45:39.160]  blood that was in san francisco but they moved to minnesota later uh and and they said it was just
[02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:45.720]  you know we took the blood at birth black ops you and your family will shoot black people up
[02:45:45.720 --> 02:45:50.680]  with syphilis all day and watch them spread it for 45 years and die with microscopic brain
[02:45:50.680 --> 02:45:55.800]  worms eating them and we will take small children black white old young it doesn't matter we'll
[02:45:55.800 --> 02:46:00.200]  radiate you to death and you will worship us and you will love us because if you don't your
[02:46:00.200 --> 02:46:05.640]  anti-government scum and we'll call you racist and we'll take black kids and give them pesticides
[02:46:05.640 --> 02:46:09.160]  till they die it'll come out in the new york daily news and no one will get in trouble
[02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:18.120]  you are six to seven times more likely to be abused in cps custody than any other custody out
[02:46:18.120 --> 02:46:21.320]  there look it up just departments own numbers there's been articles written the shame of
[02:46:21.320 --> 02:46:26.920]  foster care they'll put the average foster child on seven psychotropic drugs and they
[02:46:26.920 --> 02:46:33.480]  start having convulsions put you on anti-convulsion drugs until you die i've had the medical doctors
[02:46:33.480 --> 02:46:39.640]  on breaking it down they will never stop until we stop them and again the reason they're able
[02:46:39.640 --> 02:46:50.840]  to sell this and get away with all this is that more and more people see the bureaucrat at the
[02:46:50.840 --> 02:46:55.640]  low level that has a nice story and the bureaucrats got a job got a degree got bills to pay off with
[02:46:55.640 --> 02:46:59.880]  two college degrees or whatever you know the social workers and they just they've seen a
[02:46:59.880 --> 02:47:03.640]  lot of bad stuff society is falling apart they've got a lot of excuses for why they're doing what
[02:47:03.640 --> 02:47:09.640]  they're doing a lot of times they'll buck the system and actually won't hurt you but more and
[02:47:09.640 --> 02:47:14.200]  more they have to follow computer directives just like doctors just like lawyers where it's all
[02:47:14.200 --> 02:47:20.520]  computerized what you follow the diagnosis the treatment what you do or what you bureaucratically
[02:47:20.520 --> 02:47:25.400]  do where you're just literally a biological android that shows up and has no free will
[02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:32.200]  to discern what the best justice is now again they've given the bureaucrat stuff that's outside
[02:47:32.200 --> 02:47:39.560]  the bill of rights and constitution that's classical tyranny so that's why we have the checks and
[02:47:39.560 --> 02:47:43.960]  balances because it always gets twisted it always gets abused there's always a good excuse for it
[02:47:43.960 --> 02:47:49.640]  the road to hell is paved with good intentions but then once they actually get the power ladies and
[02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:55.960]  gentlemen it's hell on earth and you're now seeing that and the bureaucracy is growing it's not
[02:47:55.960 --> 02:48:00.040]  going to stop and there's never going to be enough money to pay off the 1.5 quadrillion it's not even
[02:48:00.040 --> 02:48:06.360]  our debt iceland said no arrested the bankers and found out 93 percent of the debt was not the 400
[02:48:06.360 --> 02:48:11.400]  thousand people of iceland's debt it was their criminal government with the british government
[02:48:11.400 --> 02:48:15.800]  had signed them onto derivatives so they just arrested the government leaders who were involved
[02:48:15.800 --> 02:48:22.680]  and they're in jail now england the british government you look it up in the bbc try to declare
[02:48:22.680 --> 02:48:26.360]  everyone in iceland a terrorist four years ago and they wouldn't go along with it and wasn't
[02:48:26.360 --> 02:48:30.280]  going to let them fly out of the country because the main airline is british airways out of iceland
[02:48:30.280 --> 02:48:36.520]  and they're dependent on the uk the people said fine listus is terrorist they found their humanity
[02:48:36.520 --> 02:48:45.560]  their will the globalist had to back off look it up icelanders listed as terrorist all of them
[02:48:45.560 --> 02:48:50.040]  five-year-old children 80-year-old men they don't care they're going to list us all as terrorist
[02:48:50.040 --> 02:48:54.600]  and take everything the level of tyranny we'll live under is the level that we accept now david
[02:48:54.600 --> 02:48:59.160]  night's going to tie this into venezuela and the literal you will not have drinking water now
[02:48:59.160 --> 02:49:06.440]  to pay the bankers the debt that you never signed on to and the dictator chavez signed on to that
[02:49:06.440 --> 02:49:12.840]  isn't even feasible to ever pay back loan sharking used to be illegal folks they just legalized payday
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:18.840]  loans in arkansas a place that used to have the strongest laws against loan sharking we are becoming
[02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:24.920]  a hell pit a predatory hell pit by every yardstick now before i go to break i want to remind you
[02:49:24.920 --> 02:49:29.240]  ladies and gentlemen that we are listed supported with the great products we sell an info or store
[02:49:29.240 --> 02:49:36.680]  dot com and for his life dot com now i personally tend to just take it straight but a lot of people
[02:49:36.680 --> 02:49:44.280]  i know take the survival shield nasa dynadine x2 that just came out a lot of people take it in water
[02:49:44.280 --> 02:49:51.640]  and that's what i do and it turns red ladies and gentlemen it's red and then turns blue on paper
[02:49:52.440 --> 02:49:56.600]  everything else turns black our older weaker form is still excellent available
[02:49:56.600 --> 02:50:00.760]  turns light blue this turns dark blue on paper that could take this water out and dump it on paper
[02:50:00.760 --> 02:50:06.600]  it turned blue because it's electric crystals this stuff is amazing it's very simple the solution
[02:50:06.600 --> 02:50:11.320]  isn't it the iodine conspiracy folks they put everything in the water and the food the bromide
[02:50:11.320 --> 02:50:16.360]  the bromide the chlorine everything on that same halogen table that's bad instead of the good halogen
[02:50:16.360 --> 02:50:23.640]  you need unbelievable consult your physician before you do this because a lot of you are so toxic like
[02:50:23.640 --> 02:50:28.760]  i was within 15 days to a month you'll go through a detox and feel like you got a hangover for a week
[02:50:28.760 --> 02:50:33.160]  but let me tell you on the other side of that for me there's been something akin to malala
[02:50:33.160 --> 02:50:42.760]  and like every blessing and everything good from god it helps from the operation it's incredible
[02:50:42.760 --> 02:50:48.680]  it helps our listeners it's win win win multi-sided victories that's what i'm into that's what i

[02:54:44.280 --> 02:54:50.280]  better job than i do many days you know i get really angry folks that there's this predatory
[02:54:50.280 --> 02:54:55.080]  takeover the la pd's announced yeah we're gonna use drones and law enforcement for man hunts to
[02:54:55.080 --> 02:55:00.600]  attract the public yeah we're weaponizing drones yeah you know what we have been putting stuff in
[02:55:00.600 --> 02:55:05.800]  the water to control you i mean and then i see the sheep like public that is just such victims
[02:55:05.800 --> 02:55:10.760]  that have no idea what they're going under i look at the wall martians the grocery store
[02:55:10.760 --> 02:55:14.680]  and what they're eating and what they're doing and then i read all the globalist documents
[02:55:14.680 --> 02:55:21.880]  where it's planned and imagine you come in and the state says the doctor now isn't with the state
[02:55:21.880 --> 02:55:26.280]  but they're a slave of the state it's indentured servitude that's totally illegal under our constitution
[02:55:27.240 --> 02:55:31.880]  and they're gonna have a private conversation with your child now and we know what's in that
[02:55:31.880 --> 02:55:35.480]  well what guns do your parents have do they beat you do you need help do you need an abortion you
[02:55:35.480 --> 02:55:39.560]  know you have a right to an abortion in california they say they can give your kids inoculations
[02:55:39.560 --> 02:55:44.680]  without parental consent because if the child wants that they can even pay them to do it
[02:55:45.320 --> 02:55:47.880]  we'll give you two hundred dollars take the shot nine year old
[02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:53.320]  well it's the same reason that a 15 year old can't have sex with an 18 year old
[02:55:53.320 --> 02:55:58.840]  you don't have consent you you aren't at the age of consent next they're gonna have loans
[02:55:58.840 --> 02:56:05.480]  to 10 year olds i mean this is pure criminal classic evil and we've got to get in the face
[02:56:05.480 --> 02:56:09.880]  of the imperious government and let them know they're not our boss that's an incredible article
[02:56:09.880 --> 02:56:14.680]  out of bloomberg david where you don't get water you don't get medicine and you know we got to pay
[02:56:14.680 --> 02:56:20.120]  the bankers their 600 plus profit on debts that are total scams if you study on the eye of a world
[02:56:20.120 --> 02:56:26.200]  bank works closing comments on that and just how big this is hey a journalist wants a four year
[02:56:26.200 --> 02:56:32.040]  request we're gonna arrest you or call homeland security for doing what's legal and lawful but
[02:56:32.040 --> 02:56:38.600]  oh your kids belong to us i mean this is literally the system trying to break our will uh i hope
[02:56:38.600 --> 02:56:43.240]  there's a big backlash against this david antoni guilty already closing comments well you know
[02:56:43.240 --> 02:56:48.680]  alex it's always about corporate profits and government control that's what this kind of
[02:56:48.680 --> 02:56:54.040]  economic fascism is about that's what we're talking about with obama care they always sell it with
[02:56:54.040 --> 02:57:00.280]  personal stories of tragedy they always position themselves as if they care so much about everybody
[02:57:00.280 --> 02:57:05.400]  just as yugo chavez and the socialist uh said that they're going to help the people against
[02:57:05.400 --> 02:57:10.280]  the giant corporations yet we learned that for 14 years this is from bloomberg they were making
[02:57:10.280 --> 02:57:17.320]  nearly 700 profits the bankers were out of yugo chavez and now as they're having economic hardship
[02:57:17.320 --> 02:57:22.600]  under the new president they are depriving the citizens there of water and even medicine they
[02:57:22.600 --> 02:57:27.880]  have to go across the border they've had 42 people die since february because of these shortages
[02:57:27.880 --> 02:57:31.560]  that's the way they always put it and we see that coming up from hillary clinton it was a story
[02:57:31.560 --> 02:57:39.720]  yesterday where she was out there talking about the uh zero point uh the point zero one percent not
[02:57:39.720 --> 02:57:43.080]  even the one percent you know the 99 versus one percent she's putting herself out there
[02:57:43.080 --> 02:57:49.320]  as a pipeline that she's concerned for people and yet at the same time she and bill and their daughter
[02:57:49.320 --> 02:57:55.240]  are at goldman sacks headquarters and they're collecting a half a billion dollars 500 million
[02:57:55.240 --> 02:58:00.680]  dollars from goldman sacks alone for that's right and they make their money off of cattle
[02:58:00.680 --> 02:58:05.720]  deals and insider deals where they go oh you won the cattle futures like oh you went to the lottery
[02:58:05.720 --> 02:58:10.840]  and you just won every time hillary no they're giving it to her as a payoff that was proven with
[02:58:10.840 --> 02:58:17.240]  mcdougal and others and again it's a rigged economy where these pigs control everything
[02:58:17.240 --> 02:58:21.320]  anthony gutsy arty anything else you'd like to add overall like we talked before the turning
[02:58:21.320 --> 02:58:25.560]  point the transformation only comes when these evil people show themselves in the light and
[02:58:25.560 --> 02:58:29.480]  they're so out in the open about everything that overall we are actually coming out and taking
[02:58:29.480 --> 02:58:33.080]  them down that's right and another way to defeat them is while there's still some remnant of a
[02:58:33.080 --> 02:58:39.160]  free market left people gotta vote with their dollars and only support liberty systems not the
