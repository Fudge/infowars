[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  We've got it.
[00:02.000 --> 00:04.000]  Thank you for coming to you.
[00:04.000 --> 00:06.000]  We've got it.
[00:06.000 --> 00:08.000]  We've got it.
[00:08.000 --> 00:10.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:10.000 --> 00:12.000]  Alright, you guys go.
[00:12.000 --> 00:14.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live
[00:14.000 --> 00:16.000]  from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:16.000 --> 00:18.000]  We've got it.
[00:18.000 --> 00:20.000]  We've got it.
[00:20.000 --> 00:22.000]  We've got it.
[00:22.000 --> 00:24.000]  We've got it.
[00:24.000 --> 00:26.000]  We've got it.
[00:26.000 --> 00:28.000]  We've got it.
[00:28.000 --> 00:30.000]  We've got it.
[00:30.000 --> 00:32.000]  We've got it.
[00:32.000 --> 00:34.000]  We've got it.
[00:34.000 --> 00:36.000]  We've got it.
[00:36.000 --> 00:38.000]  We've got it.
[00:38.000 --> 00:40.000]  We've got it.
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.000]  We've got it.
[00:48.000 --> 00:50.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much
[00:50.000 --> 00:52.000]  for joining us on this World Wide
[00:52.000 --> 00:54.000]  Broadcast.
[00:54.000 --> 00:56.000]  The president
[00:56.000 --> 00:59.360]  come out and the president has defended info wars.
[00:59.360 --> 01:03.480]  The president has defended Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:03.480 --> 01:05.640]  The video of that is coming up in the next segment.
[01:05.640 --> 01:09.320]  It's posted to newswars.com and infowars.com.
[01:11.240 --> 01:14.280]  We also have the unbelievably incredible information
[01:14.280 --> 01:16.400]  that's just broke on infowars.com.
[01:16.400 --> 01:19.960]  Donald Trump, authorities investigating possible election
[01:19.960 --> 01:21.160]  fraud in Florida.
[01:21.160 --> 01:26.160]  They have caught the Democrats with giant trucks.
[01:28.000 --> 01:30.360]  We're gonna be rolling that video next segment as well.
[01:30.360 --> 01:32.120]  I think we can b-roll some of it now.
[01:32.120 --> 01:35.280]  For TV viewers, the video is posted on infowars.com.
[01:36.920 --> 01:41.120]  Florida is at the center of explosive post-election fight
[01:41.120 --> 01:45.880]  and Arizona, suddenly the Senate seat is in question.
[01:45.880 --> 01:47.960]  Just like they fraudulently tried to keep Kavanaugh
[01:47.960 --> 01:50.920]  from getting appointed and getting confirmed
[01:50.920 --> 01:52.960]  and they've been caught lying in that case.
[01:52.960 --> 01:55.640]  They are back at it, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:55.640 --> 01:59.400]  with 18-wheelers and trucks with private individuals
[01:59.400 --> 02:02.800]  delivering the magic ballots that are needed.
[02:02.800 --> 02:03.640]  And the question is,
[02:03.640 --> 02:06.160]  would Democrats engage in election fraud?
[02:06.160 --> 02:07.360]  That's what they do.
[02:07.360 --> 02:08.840]  I mean, we've caught them all over Texas,
[02:08.840 --> 02:10.680]  everywhere else, this election cycle.
[02:10.680 --> 02:12.280]  This is unbelievable.
[02:12.280 --> 02:17.160]  So found magically, magic ballots swing Florida.
[02:17.160 --> 02:19.760]  They're set to lose the governorship they won,
[02:19.760 --> 02:23.320]  the Senate seat, the ag commissioner, everything.
[02:24.280 --> 02:27.400]  Who is the leading expert on Democrat fraud
[02:27.400 --> 02:30.760]  in the state of Florida who led George W. Bush's operation
[02:30.760 --> 02:33.880]  in 2000 and successfully exposed it
[02:33.880 --> 02:35.080]  and took it to the Supreme Court?
[02:35.080 --> 02:37.080]  Roger Stone.
[02:37.080 --> 02:42.080]  Yes, a man of many trades, many hats, hated by the left,
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.600]  he'll be joining us on the ground from Florida,
[02:47.600 --> 02:49.440]  ladies and gentlemen, where this is happening,
[02:49.440 --> 02:51.160]  where he predicted it would Broward County.
[02:51.160 --> 02:53.280]  He said on Tuesday night, he said,
[02:53.280 --> 02:56.520]  I fear they're going to find a bunch of magic ballots.
[02:56.520 --> 02:59.120]  And then they looked like they conceded.
[02:59.120 --> 03:01.280]  And he said, wow, they've never conceded before.
[03:01.280 --> 03:02.680]  They always stuff.
[03:02.680 --> 03:05.520]  They always discover magic ballots where he lives.
[03:05.520 --> 03:08.480]  Well, lo and behold, they sucker punched us.
[03:08.480 --> 03:09.960]  They waited till he looked away.
[03:09.960 --> 03:10.800]  And then,
[03:11.960 --> 03:14.840]  dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[03:14.840 --> 03:18.520]  Here comes the enterprise big truck.
[03:18.520 --> 03:20.200]  And now it's getting loaded up
[03:20.200 --> 03:23.280]  with all those magic ballots.
[03:23.280 --> 03:25.320]  They're so magical.
[03:25.320 --> 03:26.320]  They're so helpful.
[03:26.320 --> 03:29.760]  And they're just in the exact targeted races.
[03:29.760 --> 03:31.920]  Oh, and they're overwhelmingly,
[03:31.920 --> 03:33.920]  now that the recount's happening,
[03:33.920 --> 03:37.160]  they're overwhelming for the Democrats.
[03:37.160 --> 03:40.240]  This is amazing.
[03:42.400 --> 03:43.920]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:43.920 --> 03:45.840]  it's all completely transparent.
[03:45.840 --> 03:48.680]  It's all completely obvious.
[03:48.680 --> 03:51.480]  Magic-found ballots could swing the state.
[03:51.480 --> 03:54.880]  Shocking video footage shows Florida ballots
[03:54.880 --> 03:56.640]  transported by private vehicles
[03:56.640 --> 03:58.960]  being transferred into a rental truck on election night.
[03:58.960 --> 04:00.680]  The great Michael Snyder reports that
[04:00.680 --> 04:02.520]  into theamericandream.com.
[04:02.520 --> 04:05.320]  It's posted on MFullWars.com.
[04:05.320 --> 04:06.640]  Now that's it.
[04:07.640 --> 04:09.920]  Antifa has expanded its hit list of people
[04:09.920 --> 04:12.720]  they're going to target with violent threats.
[04:12.720 --> 04:14.040]  Like Paul Watson tweeted,
[04:14.040 --> 04:16.320]  when the mafia comes in and says,
[04:16.320 --> 04:17.840]  we know where you live,
[04:17.840 --> 04:20.200]  hope nothing happens to your kids.
[04:21.200 --> 04:22.600]  It's called racketeering.
[04:22.600 --> 04:25.320]  When they come to your house and bash in part of your door
[04:25.320 --> 04:27.440]  and say, we know you live here, you're not safe,
[04:27.440 --> 04:30.040]  you hurt children, your children will get hurt.
[04:31.040 --> 04:34.880]  Well, then it's okay, see, it's okay then.
[04:34.880 --> 04:37.120]  It's okay, because they're funded by George Soros
[04:37.120 --> 04:38.680]  and his nasty little son.
[04:38.680 --> 04:39.520]  So it's all right.
[04:39.520 --> 04:42.320]  The mainstream corporate media then defends them.
[04:42.320 --> 04:44.560]  So we'll be breaking it all down today.
[04:44.560 --> 04:47.880]  There's so much more I haven't gotten into as well.
[04:47.880 --> 04:51.000]  The latest from our good friend, Nancy Pelosi,
[04:51.000 --> 04:52.880]  and the new acting attorney general
[04:52.880 --> 04:54.480]  who's got the globalists so scared.
[04:54.480 --> 04:55.800]  Why are they so scared?
[04:55.800 --> 04:56.640]  Find out.
[04:57.920 --> 05:01.040]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogens
[05:01.040 --> 05:03.280]  and pump the environment full of the bad halogens,
[05:03.280 --> 05:05.720]  fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it,
[05:05.720 --> 05:09.720]  that it lowers IQ, it literally dumbs the population down.
[05:09.720 --> 05:12.400]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers,
[05:12.400 --> 05:14.080]  the best iodine in the world,
[05:14.080 --> 05:16.600]  we've gone through two permutations.
[05:16.600 --> 05:19.360]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good,
[05:19.360 --> 05:20.960]  been hard to source, and the globalists
[05:20.960 --> 05:22.840]  tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[05:22.840 --> 05:26.640]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine
[05:26.640 --> 05:29.200]  and brought UX2 that's been incredible.
[05:29.200 --> 05:31.480]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that,
[05:31.480 --> 05:34.360]  we did more research and secured more
[05:34.360 --> 05:36.520]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[05:36.520 --> 05:39.960]  But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research
[05:39.960 --> 05:42.400]  that by combining it with three other compounds,
[05:42.400 --> 05:44.920]  two forms of iodine and vitamin C,
[05:44.920 --> 05:49.920]  it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[05:50.360 --> 05:52.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to research it,
[05:52.120 --> 05:54.360]  you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[05:54.360 --> 05:57.640]  X3, now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[06:02.000 --> 06:04.920]  You are listening to an InfoWarsLife.com
[06:04.920 --> 06:08.720]  listening to an InfoWars.com front-line report.
[06:10.960 --> 06:13.480]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[06:13.480 --> 06:15.280]  you are the resistance.
[06:22.560 --> 06:27.240]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas,
[06:27.240 --> 06:35.240]  transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:36.680 --> 06:40.800]  It's Friday, the ninth day of November, 2018,
[06:40.800 --> 06:46.120]  and oh, the Republicans had won the three Senate seats.
[06:46.120 --> 06:49.560]  And by there'd only been 26 losses in the House.
[06:49.560 --> 06:53.360]  And magically then, as soon as we all turned away,
[06:53.360 --> 06:57.480]  18 wheelers in Arizona, California and Florida,
[06:57.480 --> 07:01.280]  came rolling in in the ballots, magically being counted.
[07:01.280 --> 07:06.280]  In some cases, in some precincts, are 100% Democrat, 100%.
[07:11.480 --> 07:16.160]  And magically, looks like the Republicans might lose
[07:16.160 --> 07:19.400]  two of their senators, two of their governors,
[07:19.400 --> 07:21.200]  and a bunch of other key races.
[07:21.200 --> 07:25.760]  Man, oh, man, my, oh, my.
[07:27.880 --> 07:29.600]  Isn't that just horrible?
[07:29.600 --> 07:34.080]  And Donald Trump says he has dispatched Homeland Security
[07:34.080 --> 07:37.240]  to investigate possible election fraud.
[07:37.240 --> 07:41.080]  That's like asking, how do you know what CNN is lying?
[07:41.080 --> 07:44.560]  It's when you dial their channel and you can bet,
[07:44.560 --> 07:46.920]  it's distortion and lies.
[07:46.920 --> 07:49.320]  It's the old joke when Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton
[07:49.320 --> 07:52.920]  are lying when their lips are moving, but it's worse than that.
[07:52.920 --> 07:55.440]  They're constantly waging war against reality.
[07:56.680 --> 07:59.840]  It is the corporate fake presses job
[07:59.840 --> 08:02.520]  to not just lie to us, but then to distort
[08:02.520 --> 08:04.440]  and lie about any real media.
[08:05.480 --> 08:08.240]  And then to try to have it censored off the air.
[08:08.240 --> 08:09.720]  So we have all this incredible news,
[08:09.720 --> 08:12.480]  Antifa expanding its violent hit list,
[08:12.480 --> 08:13.880]  the political violence escalates,
[08:13.880 --> 08:15.280]  that's the Washington Times.
[08:15.280 --> 08:20.280]  So everything is getting out of control
[08:22.920 --> 08:24.200]  at an accelerated rate.
[08:24.200 --> 08:27.720]  We have massive Islamic invasion news in Europe.
[08:29.360 --> 08:33.880]  We have Venezuela collapsing into beyond road warrior,
[08:35.000 --> 08:37.320]  beyond Thunderdome type scenarios.
[08:41.160 --> 08:44.600]  We have Trump signing an executive order
[08:44.600 --> 08:47.360]  saying that those in the illegal caravan
[08:47.360 --> 08:49.720]  will not be given the option
[08:49.720 --> 08:54.240]  of applying for political or religious persecution
[08:54.240 --> 08:55.080]  because they're coming
[08:55.080 --> 08:57.240]  as part of an organized criminal mob.
[08:57.240 --> 08:58.680]  And so he's saying under an executive order,
[08:58.680 --> 09:00.000]  which he has the total power to do,
[09:00.000 --> 09:02.720]  presidents over that, over immigration, over the borders,
[09:02.720 --> 09:04.000]  that that will not be accepted.
[09:04.000 --> 09:05.520]  They'll have a bunch of lawsuits filed,
[09:05.520 --> 09:09.120]  but those two will make their way to the Supreme Court
[09:09.120 --> 09:11.520]  and will be overthrown.
[09:11.520 --> 09:14.920]  But all the other judges below will engage
[09:14.920 --> 09:16.840]  in criminal activity against the country
[09:16.840 --> 09:18.200]  and try to stall as long as they can.
[09:18.200 --> 09:21.160]  But in the end, as long as we can keep Trump alive
[09:21.160 --> 09:24.000]  and keep him in office another six years,
[09:24.000 --> 09:27.120]  this country will be about 50% turned around,
[09:27.120 --> 09:28.520]  which then we could save it.
[09:30.000 --> 09:32.160]  Now, here's the big news.
[09:32.160 --> 09:34.920]  And I don't wanna make in full wars the big news here,
[09:34.920 --> 09:38.480]  but when we are one of the top news stories in the world,
[09:38.480 --> 09:39.960]  this is all over Russian news,
[09:39.960 --> 09:43.400]  it's all over Japanese news, it's all over European news,
[09:43.400 --> 09:47.480]  it's all over US news, it's everywhere.
[09:47.480 --> 09:51.360]  I start getting calls yesterday morning at my house
[09:52.240 --> 09:53.880]  saying, did you doctor the video?
[09:54.800 --> 09:56.560]  And I said, what video?
[09:56.560 --> 09:59.360]  And it was Paul Watson zooming in
[09:59.360 --> 10:01.280]  on the video everybody saw live
[10:01.280 --> 10:03.680]  of Jim Acosta pushing the woman's arm down
[10:03.680 --> 10:05.600]  with kind of a light push karate chop
[10:07.040 --> 10:08.560]  and then pulling his hand away from her
[10:08.560 --> 10:10.600]  when she tries to take the microphone away.
[10:11.840 --> 10:14.000]  And to change the subject from that,
[10:14.000 --> 10:16.800]  because Acosta then lied and said, I didn't touch her.
[10:17.760 --> 10:19.640]  They turned it around and said that we doctored it
[10:19.640 --> 10:24.640]  and then had this string of so-called video experts
[10:24.840 --> 10:28.320]  get up and say that we sped it up and then slowed it down.
[10:28.320 --> 10:30.680]  No, I've taken Watson's video,
[10:30.680 --> 10:32.640]  I've looked at the raw HD we have,
[10:32.640 --> 10:36.720]  they're exactly the same except for seven dropped frames
[10:36.720 --> 10:38.920]  throughout the thousands of frames.
[10:40.800 --> 10:42.800]  Remember, there's 25 frames per second.
[10:44.320 --> 10:46.840]  And we went and looked at it and that's what happens
[10:46.840 --> 10:48.600]  when you upload stuff to Twitter,
[10:48.600 --> 10:51.680]  it has a crappy video system as everyone knows.
[10:51.680 --> 10:54.840]  You shoot beautiful HD, you upload it,
[10:54.840 --> 10:57.520]  it loses a bunch of quality, dropped frames are in there.
[10:57.520 --> 10:59.520]  Everybody sees us live on TV when I say,
[10:59.520 --> 11:01.240]  oh, this clip just came in, we play it,
[11:01.240 --> 11:04.200]  and there's glitches and the audio's off.
[11:04.200 --> 11:07.560]  Sometimes it does it really bad,
[11:07.560 --> 11:09.640]  it's just the way different systems work together,
[11:09.640 --> 11:11.240]  a lot of them don't integrate.
[11:11.240 --> 11:14.440]  But with Paul, he just zooms it in,
[11:15.440 --> 11:16.720]  but then the circle of experts go,
[11:16.720 --> 11:18.920]  but we looked and there was edits.
[11:18.920 --> 11:21.920]  Now other top experts have come out in newspapers and said,
[11:21.920 --> 11:23.000]  no, those are dropped frames,
[11:23.000 --> 11:24.520]  which is normal with compression
[11:24.520 --> 11:25.720]  on different internet formats.
[11:25.720 --> 11:28.960]  It has not been doctored in a way to be doctored
[11:28.960 --> 11:31.280]  where they're trying to change the meaning of it.
[11:31.280 --> 11:33.840]  This is what happens when you blow video up
[11:33.840 --> 11:37.320]  on cheap editing systems and then you upload it to Twitter.
[11:37.320 --> 11:39.400]  And God love Paul, he's great, he does so much work,
[11:39.400 --> 11:40.560]  he's a one man wrecking crew,
[11:40.560 --> 11:42.680]  I've offered him better equipment, I've offered him crew,
[11:42.680 --> 11:43.960]  he doesn't want to do it,
[11:43.960 --> 11:46.400]  because I would have grabbed an HD and uploaded an HD.
[11:46.400 --> 11:47.920]  We like to do stuff HD,
[11:47.920 --> 11:49.680]  then there wouldn't be any dropped frames for any problems.
[11:49.680 --> 11:51.880]  But it doesn't matter.
[11:51.880 --> 11:54.040]  Jim Acosta in front of the whole world
[11:55.360 --> 11:57.880]  wouldn't sit down, had asked three questions,
[11:57.880 --> 12:00.560]  was argumentative, wouldn't give her the microphone back
[12:00.560 --> 12:05.560]  and pushed a woman and shoved her, there's three actions there.
[12:05.760 --> 12:08.160]  And that they would think in the corporate media
[12:08.160 --> 12:10.360]  that they would change the subject and say
[12:10.360 --> 12:14.280]  in thousands of BBC, London Telegraph,
[12:14.280 --> 12:17.040]  Guardian, New York Times, Washington Post, LA Times,
[12:17.040 --> 12:19.240]  Dallas Morning News, Austin American Statesman,
[12:19.240 --> 12:21.200]  everything, just thousands.
[12:21.200 --> 12:24.040]  Alex Jones caught in another lie, editing video,
[12:24.040 --> 12:25.680]  Acosta didn't touch her.
[12:27.440 --> 12:30.520]  When everyone can watch the HD footage everywhere,
[12:30.520 --> 12:31.960]  you can clearly see he did it,
[12:31.960 --> 12:33.920]  but this is how they do distraction.
[12:37.120 --> 12:41.160]  And then they had all these other people come out again
[12:41.160 --> 12:43.400]  and say, I'm an expert, I'm an expert, I'm an expert.
[12:43.400 --> 12:46.400]  Look, they edited it, and then they would edit it
[12:46.400 --> 12:48.360]  to say that we edited it.
[12:48.360 --> 12:49.920]  But all these other experts have come out and said,
[12:49.920 --> 12:53.200]  no, it's the exact same link, it's the exact same time.
[12:53.200 --> 12:54.960]  Watching this video is a little washed out
[12:54.960 --> 12:56.760]  because of crappy compression.
[12:56.760 --> 12:57.600]  That's it.
[12:57.600 --> 13:02.720]  That's it, but we have to sit here and spend time on this
[13:02.720 --> 13:05.920]  because this is the mind control, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:08.400 --> 13:11.760]  This is the mind control where everyone saw him
[13:11.760 --> 13:13.960]  push the woman, shove her arm down,
[13:13.960 --> 13:16.080]  and pull back away from her and keep talking
[13:17.040 --> 13:18.640]  until the president had to get involved.
[13:18.640 --> 13:21.200]  Corey Lewandowski barely touched a woman.
[13:21.200 --> 13:24.160]  There's six frames of video, you've got to pause,
[13:24.160 --> 13:26.120]  and maybe he touched her.
[13:26.120 --> 13:28.640]  Maybe he kind of went like that.
[13:28.640 --> 13:30.200]  Other than that, going through crowds all the time.
[13:30.200 --> 13:33.280]  This turns into, into the world, Donald Trump's people
[13:33.280 --> 13:34.840]  are brutalizing women.
[13:34.840 --> 13:39.200]  Acosta does 500 times the action.
[13:39.200 --> 13:40.840]  We're not even sure Lewandowski did anything.
[13:40.840 --> 13:43.280]  Let's just say he brushed her his hand like two seconds,
[13:43.280 --> 13:48.160]  you know, a millisecond, six frames, just barely touched her.
[13:49.720 --> 13:51.920]  This is clear in front of everyone,
[13:51.920 --> 13:55.160]  and they changed the subject to say, you didn't see that.
[13:55.160 --> 13:59.440]  No, Alex Jones, the evil mastermind,
[13:59.440 --> 14:03.120]  he went in and showed, it accelerated,
[14:03.120 --> 14:07.120]  and then showed it slow down to make it look worse than it was.
[14:07.120 --> 14:10.200]  Worse than it was, Acosta says he didn't touch her.
[14:12.840 --> 14:14.280]  Even Fox News came out and said,
[14:14.280 --> 14:15.480]  ah, the evil Alex Jones,
[14:15.480 --> 14:17.560]  because they're in competition, folks,
[14:17.560 --> 14:18.800]  with independent media.
[14:18.800 --> 14:20.120]  They all know what they're doing.
[14:20.120 --> 14:22.920]  But you know what, the president isn't.
[14:22.920 --> 14:25.600]  And Paul tweeted this video out at President Planet,
[14:25.600 --> 14:27.480]  Paul's Twitter, nobody manipulated it.
[14:27.480 --> 14:28.320]  Give me a break.
[14:28.320 --> 14:31.000]  See, that just is dishonest reporting.
[14:31.000 --> 14:32.600]  I watched it last night.
[14:32.600 --> 14:34.040]  They made it close up.
[14:34.040 --> 14:35.400]  That's not doctoring.
[14:36.200 --> 14:38.040]  We're gonna play the president in a moment,
[14:38.040 --> 14:41.440]  but coming up in the next hour,
[14:41.440 --> 14:44.320]  we have caught media matters in George Soros,
[14:44.320 --> 14:48.080]  100% doctoring a video about Owen Schreuer
[14:48.080 --> 14:51.640]  and calling for us to be removed off of the air.
[14:51.640 --> 14:54.160]  They say that we bullied a black family.
[14:56.480 --> 14:58.720]  The people came over, pushed Owen for no reason,
[14:58.720 --> 15:01.560]  got in his face, Owen said, oh my gosh,
[15:01.560 --> 15:03.440]  boy, that's bizarre behavior from you.
[15:03.440 --> 15:05.760]  And then, but they cut the front off, see?
[15:07.240 --> 15:08.840]  Just like the Mexican supremacist said,
[15:08.840 --> 15:11.040]  you're white, you're subhuman, you're a monkey,
[15:11.040 --> 15:12.600]  your mother's married or a brother,
[15:12.600 --> 15:15.040]  you're total scum, gringo, you're going down.
[15:15.040 --> 15:16.160]  I said, man, you're really racist.
[15:16.160 --> 15:17.000]  They cut it.
[15:17.000 --> 15:18.840]  Facebook's official system cut it up.
[15:18.840 --> 15:20.880]  It looked like I was attacking Hispanic women.
[15:20.880 --> 15:23.560]  Let's go out to the break with the president.
[15:23.560 --> 15:25.000]  Here he is.
[15:25.000 --> 15:29.520]  The tape video of Costa, what are you talking about?
[15:30.520 --> 15:34.160]  All that was, nobody manipulated it, give me a break.
[15:34.160 --> 15:36.080]  See, that's just dishonest reporting.
[15:36.080 --> 15:37.800]  All that is is a close up.
[15:37.800 --> 15:41.120]  See, that's just dishonest reporting.
[15:41.120 --> 15:43.320]  I watched that, I heard that last night.
[15:43.320 --> 15:46.160]  They made it close up, they showed it close up.
[15:46.160 --> 15:48.160]  And he was not nice to that young woman.
[15:48.160 --> 15:49.920]  I don't hold them for that.
[15:49.920 --> 15:53.080]  Because it wasn't overly, you know, horrible.
[15:53.080 --> 15:55.320]  But it was, but all that was when you say doctor,
[15:55.320 --> 15:56.800]  you're a dishonest guy.
[15:56.800 --> 15:57.760]  Because it wasn't...
[15:57.760 --> 15:59.840]  Thanks for sticking up for us.
[15:59.840 --> 16:01.040]  Hear that?
[16:01.040 --> 16:03.160]  That's the sound of a house being trashed
[16:03.160 --> 16:06.400]  while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[16:06.400 --> 16:09.240]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[16:09.240 --> 16:12.880]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[16:12.880 --> 16:15.520]  Go to faketv.com and discover a device
[16:15.520 --> 16:18.720]  that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV.

[16:21.920 --> 16:25.000]  And fake TV should be part of your security solution.

[16:27.440 --> 16:29.440]  Faketv.com.
[16:29.440 --> 16:31.360]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense

[16:32.880 --> 16:34.240]  to cook food and boil water.
[16:34.240 --> 16:37.040]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove
[16:37.040 --> 16:40.160]  or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[16:40.160 --> 16:43.400]  The Miniman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove
[16:43.400 --> 16:45.640]  that only requires small quantities of sticks
[16:45.640 --> 16:46.680]  and twigs for fuel.
[16:46.680 --> 16:49.360]  The Miniman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable,
[16:49.360 --> 16:50.760]  powerful, and sustainable.

[18:00.200 --> 18:03.800]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[18:03.800 --> 18:05.600]  Introducing pollen block.
[18:05.600 --> 18:08.480]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way
[18:08.480 --> 18:12.080]  to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting
[18:12.080 --> 18:17.600]  clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[18:17.600 --> 18:20.360]  In the 1960s, researchers in France
[18:20.360 --> 18:22.880]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[18:22.880 --> 18:26.800]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.800 --> 18:29.640]  They began studying this effect in published trials,
[18:29.640 --> 18:32.760]  and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research,
[18:32.760 --> 18:35.200]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet that
[18:35.200 --> 18:37.800]  helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[18:37.800 --> 18:40.440]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[18:40.440 --> 18:42.160]  It is not an antihistamine.
[18:42.160 --> 18:44.680]  In fact, current research has found that it actually
[18:44.680 --> 18:47.400]  acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which
[18:47.400 --> 18:51.080]  is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses
[18:51.080 --> 18:52.160]  in the body.
[18:52.160 --> 18:54.800]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:54.800 --> 18:58.640]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block
[18:58.640 --> 19:01.280]  chewable tablets.

[20:17.000 --> 20:20.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation,
[20:20.000 --> 20:24.000]  it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines
[20:24.000 --> 20:35.000]  of the Infowar.
[20:35.000 --> 20:38.000]  As you can see in this video, this intern came up to me.
[20:38.000 --> 20:40.000]  They're describing her as an intern.
[20:40.000 --> 20:42.000]  I don't really know who she is, and attempted
[20:42.000 --> 20:44.000]  to take the microphone away from me.
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.000]  All I can say at that point is that I was trying
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.000]  to hang on to the microphone so I could continue
[20:48.000 --> 20:50.000]  to ask the president questions.
[20:50.000 --> 20:53.000]  Obviously, I didn't put my hands on her
[20:53.000 --> 20:56.000]  or touch her as they're alleging.
[20:56.000 --> 20:58.000]  Mr President, if I may ask one other question.
[20:58.000 --> 21:00.000]  Are you worried yet?
[21:00.000 --> 21:02.000]  That's enough.
[21:02.000 --> 21:04.000]  Pardon me, ma'am.
[21:04.000 --> 21:08.000]  Obviously, I didn't put my hands on her
[21:08.000 --> 21:10.000]  or touch her as they're alleging.
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.000]  You know, I didn't put my hands on her
[21:13.000 --> 21:16.000]  or touch her as they're alleging.
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.000]  That's enough.
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.000]  You know, I didn't put my hands on her
[21:20.000 --> 21:22.000]  or touch her as they're alleging.
[21:22.000 --> 21:23.000]  That's enough.
[21:23.000 --> 21:24.000]  I think that's not your argument.
[21:24.000 --> 21:25.000]  You're a very rude person.
[21:25.000 --> 21:27.560]  The way you treat Sarah Huckabee is horrible.
[21:27.560 --> 21:29.800]  And the way you treat other people are horrible.
[21:29.800 --> 21:32.200]  You shouldn't treat people that way.
[21:32.200 --> 21:35.880]  Now, there's so many facets to this.
[21:35.880 --> 21:43.880]  You remember on September 11, 2016, month and a half out from the 2016 election, Hillary
[21:43.880 --> 21:48.160]  fell down in front of her black ambulance that we first broke a month before, that she
[21:48.160 --> 21:50.640]  has a black ambulance, a wheelchair.
[21:50.640 --> 21:51.640]  They have a medical tent.
[21:51.640 --> 21:53.820]  She's having convulsions every 45 minutes.
[21:53.820 --> 21:55.320]  We were told this by the Secret Service.
[21:55.320 --> 21:59.320]  In fact, it was so secret that the RNC, they said, we've got a message for you.
[21:59.320 --> 22:00.320]  You'll get it in the next few weeks.
[22:00.320 --> 22:01.320]  It was months.
[22:01.320 --> 22:03.200]  And they delivered it in person.
[22:03.200 --> 22:05.720]  They said, you got parole of the country, right?
[22:05.720 --> 22:06.720]  Follow the ambulance.
[22:06.720 --> 22:07.720]  It's a black van.
[22:07.720 --> 22:09.240]  We said, we don't have career wear.
[22:09.240 --> 22:10.720]  He said, we'll just try.
[22:10.720 --> 22:18.720]  Well, we ended up getting it in Ohio and somebody else caught it in New York.
[22:18.720 --> 22:23.080]  Being an MSNBC would show her stumble as she starts having the seizure, but not fall on
[22:23.080 --> 22:25.440]  her face or get picked up and put in.
[22:25.440 --> 22:31.520]  And they would say that we were lying and that she only stumbled and they would cut
[22:31.520 --> 22:34.280]  before she fell down.
[22:34.280 --> 22:35.640]  They would say, see, she's just stumbled.
[22:35.640 --> 22:36.640]  This is fake news.
[22:36.640 --> 22:39.040]  But the internet all saw it, so they knew they were lying.
[22:39.040 --> 22:45.120]  In fact, try to find that clip, guys, that was had one like media claims, M4s lying that
[22:45.120 --> 22:48.680]  Hillary did not fall down, cut clip before she falls down.
[22:48.680 --> 22:53.040]  That's the level of deception and of criminal activity we're dealing with.
[22:53.040 --> 22:54.760]  And as a mass, they do it.
[22:54.760 --> 22:57.760]  So Jim McCauser says, I don't know who this woman is.
[22:57.760 --> 22:58.960]  He's there every week.
[22:58.960 --> 23:00.880]  He's there every day at these things.
[23:00.880 --> 23:06.280]  Everyone knows who the staffers are that go around giving people the microphone.
[23:06.280 --> 23:10.320]  They sit there and they beg for it and they look for it and they reach out for it.
[23:10.320 --> 23:11.920]  He says, I don't know who this person is.
[23:11.920 --> 23:16.520]  Like he's walking down some dark alley and someone comes up and touches him so he karate
[23:16.520 --> 23:17.520]  chops him.
[23:17.520 --> 23:18.520]  No.
[23:18.520 --> 23:19.520]  Everything's alive.
[23:19.520 --> 23:20.520]  This little decepticon.
[23:20.520 --> 23:22.200]  I have no idea who this woman is.
[23:22.200 --> 23:23.720]  I've just asked three questions.
[23:23.720 --> 23:28.480]  I'm just running over the president, eight feet from him right in front of the podium
[23:28.480 --> 23:29.640]  pointing my finger at him.
[23:29.640 --> 23:33.760]  And then after he says, sit down, give the mic back, I don't know who came over to get
[23:33.760 --> 23:34.760]  it.
[23:34.760 --> 23:38.400]  A five-year-old knows that you go to these events as the person handing the microphone
[23:38.400 --> 23:39.400]  out when they ask for it.
[23:39.400 --> 23:40.400]  You give it back.
[23:40.400 --> 23:42.040]  So he's lying about that.
[23:42.040 --> 23:43.280]  And then he says, the whopper.
[23:43.280 --> 23:45.920]  I did not even touch her.
[23:45.920 --> 23:50.360]  The national news went with that and said, Jones edited it to make it look like he touched
[23:50.360 --> 23:52.640]  her with trick video.
[23:52.640 --> 23:55.160]  People went and looked at it and they said, they zoomed in.
[23:55.160 --> 23:56.160]  They just blew it up.
[23:56.160 --> 24:00.720]  They went, oh, well, still, they sped it up and then they slowed it down.
[24:00.720 --> 24:04.760]  Then the clip's the exact same length.
[24:04.760 --> 24:08.160]  It's unbelievable the mind control they try to engage in.
[24:08.160 --> 24:09.160]  It's ridiculous.
[24:09.160 --> 24:11.520]  It's what it is.
[24:11.520 --> 24:17.080]  And the president came out and responded because they were pressuring the White House to apologize
[24:17.080 --> 24:22.520]  to Acosta and have Sanders apologize for putting out a Paul Joseph Watson info wars tweet.
[24:22.520 --> 24:24.080]  How dare you?
[24:24.080 --> 24:25.560]  How dare you?
[24:25.560 --> 24:29.400]  So Trump went and looked at it and said, properly, because he's worked in television for decades,
[24:29.400 --> 24:30.900]  no, they blew it up.
[24:30.900 --> 24:32.240]  They zoomed in.
[24:32.240 --> 24:34.120]  That's not doctoring.
[24:34.120 --> 24:37.360]  Doctoring is changing something to make it look like something else.
[24:37.360 --> 24:40.440]  Zooming in is making it clearer.
[24:40.440 --> 24:42.520]  Zooming in is transparency.
[24:42.520 --> 24:44.520]  Zooming in is investigating.
[24:44.520 --> 24:47.280]  Zooming in is checking.
[24:47.280 --> 24:52.440]  When you read the newspaper and you look closer at the print, are you doctoring or are you
[24:52.440 --> 24:54.360]  investigating?
[24:54.360 --> 24:56.080]  We were clarifying.
[24:56.080 --> 24:57.880]  We were making it clear.
[24:57.880 --> 24:59.560]  We were zooming in.
[24:59.560 --> 25:01.200]  We were doing the opposite of lying.
[25:01.200 --> 25:02.600]  We were revealing.
[25:02.600 --> 25:03.760]  What does sunshine do?
[25:03.760 --> 25:05.160]  It reveals.
[25:05.160 --> 25:06.240]  What does a curtain do?
[25:06.240 --> 25:07.240]  Like mainstream media.
[25:07.240 --> 25:08.640]  It brings darkness.
[25:08.640 --> 25:10.640]  You stumble in the dark.
[25:10.640 --> 25:14.680]  Here's the president defending Paul Watson info wars and reality.
[25:14.680 --> 25:18.280]  The tape video of Costa.
[25:18.280 --> 25:20.280]  What are you talking about?
[25:20.280 --> 25:22.640]  All that was nobody manipulated it.
[25:22.640 --> 25:23.640]  Give me a break.
[25:23.640 --> 25:25.800]  See, that's just dishonest reporting.
[25:25.800 --> 25:27.480]  All that is is a close up.
[25:27.480 --> 25:30.720]  See, that's just that is just dishonest reporting.
[25:30.720 --> 25:31.720]  I watched that.
[25:31.720 --> 25:33.000]  I heard that last night.
[25:33.000 --> 25:34.280]  They made it close up.
[25:34.280 --> 25:37.760]  They showed it close up and he was not nice to that young woman.
[25:37.760 --> 25:43.320]  I don't hold them for that because it wasn't overly, you know, horrible, but it was, but
[25:43.320 --> 25:48.000]  all that was when you say doctor, you're a dishonest guy because it wasn't doctor.
[25:48.000 --> 25:49.760]  They gave a close up view.
[25:49.760 --> 25:50.760]  That's not doctoring.
[25:50.760 --> 25:58.480]  No, I wish her well.
[25:58.480 --> 25:59.480]  So there you go.
[25:59.480 --> 26:00.480]  The video is up on info wars.com.
[26:00.480 --> 26:02.880]  I'll probably say that's fake video as you showed.
[26:02.880 --> 26:03.880]  It's all they've got.
[26:03.880 --> 26:05.040]  They're caught.
[26:05.040 --> 26:06.040]  They're known liars.
[26:06.040 --> 26:07.040]  No, no, no.
[26:07.040 --> 26:08.040]  They're coming up.
[26:08.040 --> 26:11.680]  Oh, it's walking down the street.
[26:11.680 --> 26:14.800]  He's at the Smithsonian about Black History Month and how black unemployment is the lowest
[26:14.800 --> 26:19.360]  ever recorded and how Trump loves black people and some weird leftist black people come over
[26:19.360 --> 26:22.520]  and start pushing him saying, get out of here.
[26:22.520 --> 26:25.440]  He goes, that's not very nice and leaves.
[26:25.440 --> 26:30.040]  They edited it to say, Owen shroyer attacks innocent black family.
[26:30.040 --> 26:33.360]  Now you want to see doctoring.
[26:33.360 --> 26:38.440]  You're going to show you criminal level doctoring, which is criminal as they're trying to then
[26:38.440 --> 26:42.640]  use it in a nationwide campaign right now and newspapers everywhere to take us off the
[26:42.640 --> 26:43.640]  air.
[26:43.640 --> 26:50.760]  Watch Jones is attacked dog, white supremacist, bully black family.
[26:50.760 --> 26:52.880]  They mean business.
[26:52.880 --> 26:57.560]  I mean, that is, this is just getting crazier and crazier.
[26:57.560 --> 27:01.160]  It says we dehumanize and harassed a black family.
[27:01.160 --> 27:03.680]  America must act now to stop the evil.
[27:03.680 --> 27:04.680]  That's coming up.
[27:04.680 --> 27:08.280]  Now, this next piece you're going to see is a bit of satire, but it's not.
[27:08.280 --> 27:12.520]  They said, Cory Lewy Dowsky basically brutalized and tried to rip a woman's arm out of her
[27:12.520 --> 27:18.280]  socket, like Beowulf did Grendel, six frames, barely brushed, brushed beside her.
[27:18.280 --> 27:25.840]  Acosta slaps, pushes down her arm hard, pulls away and she lets go.
[27:25.840 --> 27:30.240]  That's kind of a little tussle, but I wouldn't say she get arrested for it.
[27:30.240 --> 27:32.800]  Now, under Democrat rules, he murdered her.
[27:32.800 --> 27:36.200]  He was Godzilla coming out of the water vaporizing DC.
[27:36.200 --> 27:37.200]  Okay.
[27:37.200 --> 27:41.600]  So under Democrat rules, you're about to see Millie Weaver just a few months ago at one
[27:41.600 --> 27:47.800]  of the Trump events and she's trying to talk to Acosta being very polite and the bodyguard
[27:47.800 --> 27:52.640]  Godzilla attacks and kills her, her head's cut off, blood sprays.
[27:52.640 --> 27:53.640]  She dies.
[27:53.640 --> 27:54.640]  Now that didn't really happen.
[27:54.640 --> 27:58.600]  But according to Democrat level, like touching someone, if it's a Republican to a woman, it's
[27:58.600 --> 28:00.520]  devastating assault.
[28:00.520 --> 28:04.360]  So compared to Lewy Dowsky, this is, this is death.
[28:04.360 --> 28:05.360]  Here's the footage.
[28:05.360 --> 28:06.360]  Nothing to worry about.
[28:06.360 --> 28:07.360]  Are you okay with news being censored?
[28:07.360 --> 28:08.360]  You're okay with media organizations being censored?
[28:08.360 --> 28:09.360]  You really have nothing to worry about.
[28:09.360 --> 28:10.360]  Are you okay with news being censored?
[28:10.360 --> 28:11.360]  You just saw Millie.
[28:11.360 --> 28:12.360]  We were killed by Jim Acosta's security.
[28:12.360 --> 28:13.360]  He really have nothing to worry about.
[28:13.360 --> 28:14.360]  Murdered.
[28:14.360 --> 28:15.360]  Are you okay with...
[28:15.360 --> 28:16.360]  Now, I'm in sarcastic.
[28:16.360 --> 28:17.360]  That's satire.
[28:17.360 --> 28:28.480]  I don't think the guy, he was nice at first, she was nice.
[28:28.480 --> 28:32.880]  He got a little, you know, a reporter-y and he, there was no need to push the thing back
[28:32.880 --> 28:34.480]  because it wasn't in his face.
[28:34.480 --> 28:39.160]  But okay, I'm not saying it's assault, but according to Democrats, Jim Acosta murdered
[28:39.160 --> 28:40.480]  Millie Weaver, our reporter.
[28:40.480 --> 28:43.440]  He murdered her and then he ate her body.
[28:43.440 --> 28:47.240]  He chopped her head off and drank her blood and then, and, and yeah, well, of course it's
[28:47.240 --> 28:48.240]  not real.
[28:48.240 --> 28:51.880]  But see, I'm trying to be like CNN now, so our reporter was murdered by Jim Acosta's
[28:51.880 --> 28:52.880]  people.
[28:52.880 --> 28:53.880]  Of course, that's not true.
[28:53.880 --> 28:54.880]  Let me, let me be clear.
[28:54.880 --> 28:55.880]  I'm illustrating.
[28:55.880 --> 28:58.000]  If I was like them, what I would be saying, we'll be right back.
[28:58.000 --> 28:59.000]  Okay?
[28:59.000 --> 29:00.480]  Yup.
[29:00.480 --> 29:02.820]  He did.

[33:42.220 --> 33:47.340]  So Jim Acosta is the guy that said that he was at the hospital and President
[33:47.340 --> 33:53.060]  Trump did not visit Congressman Scalise. He also seconded and continued
[33:53.060 --> 33:58.060]  reporting what MSNBC was saying over at CNN that they had removed the bust of
[33:58.060 --> 34:03.740]  Martin Luther King. The Trump had ordered that done. This is a man dedicated to
[34:03.740 --> 34:10.500]  complete evil and his world is about deceiving you. And that entire channel at
[34:10.500 --> 34:16.620]  CNN is not media. It's about destroying free speech, hounding Infowars off of the
[34:16.620 --> 34:23.340]  Internet. So we joke about these people but we have new footage that I'm gonna
[34:23.340 --> 34:27.540]  air coming up after Paul leaves us. And then I have Owen Schroyer later in
[34:27.540 --> 34:31.060]  studio talk about this because George Soros and Media Matters have a new
[34:31.060 --> 34:37.260]  national campaign to take us off the air saying that we assaulted verbally an
[34:37.260 --> 34:42.940]  innocent black family on the street. It's the opposite. They heard Owen doing
[34:42.940 --> 34:47.780]  a report about how black poll numbers were very high for Trump and how Trump
[34:47.780 --> 34:51.420]  was really trying to help African Americans and these folks came over and
[34:51.420 --> 34:55.620]  sort of bumping him and saying get out of here. Media Matters headed that off and
[34:55.620 --> 35:00.580]  it is criminal. But that's who these people are. Dedicated to murdering
[35:00.580 --> 35:08.260]  truth. Dedicated. Like Acosta is such a liar in the same piece yesterday during
[35:08.260 --> 35:11.980]  the two and a half minute exchange. We'll play it later for Paul leaves. He says
[35:11.980 --> 35:16.380]  there is no migrant caravan. They're hundreds of miles away. It's not real
[35:16.380 --> 35:22.140]  and Trump goes oh they're actors. This is the everything's a lie. He's a lie
[35:22.140 --> 35:26.820]  machine. He says he didn't touch her. Let's play that piece that we just played
[35:26.820 --> 35:30.980]  earlier before we go to Paul and then the president. Here is Acosta. This is for TV
[35:30.980 --> 35:34.460]  viewers mainly for radio listeners. He's saying he never even touched her and
[35:34.460 --> 35:39.020]  it's him pushing down her arm and then pulling it away and you see she lets go
[35:39.020 --> 35:43.780]  because it was pretty forceful. Now we can let this pass in the moment because
[35:43.780 --> 35:47.940]  she initiated contact. But by the time the president said stop it he better stop
[35:47.940 --> 35:52.020]  it. We're not like the left saying if you touch somebody it's a soul. But it
[35:52.020 --> 35:55.780]  started to go into that area. But then when he said he didn't touch her in front
[35:55.780 --> 35:59.900]  of the whole world when it's on video and he says we're lying and that we
[35:59.900 --> 36:04.780]  doctored it. I've never heard of such lies and it just goes to the mindset of
[36:04.780 --> 36:07.620]  these people and now the president's responded defending Paul Watson and
[36:07.620 --> 36:11.740]  info wars. But here is the compilation. He and I were going back and forth there
[36:11.740 --> 36:15.740]  and as you can see in this video this intern came up to me. I think they're
[36:15.740 --> 36:18.860]  describing her as an intern. I don't really know who she is and attempted to
[36:18.860 --> 36:22.500]  take the microphone away from me. Stop it there. All I can say is stop it there.
[36:22.500 --> 36:27.500]  I started over for TV viewers for radio listeners. Seeing in cuts and loops
[36:27.500 --> 36:33.220]  footage doesn't show the confrontation to say see nothing happened. And then
[36:33.220 --> 36:37.340]  Anderson Cooper comes back and says wow you saw a video folks never touched her.
[36:37.340 --> 36:42.580]  We have that coming up to the unedited clip. The full clip. I mean the level of
[36:42.580 --> 36:47.300]  the gaslighting is these people are unbelievable. What next level will they
[36:47.300 --> 36:51.180]  go to? Sorry sorry. Start the clip over. He and I were going back and forth there
[36:51.180 --> 36:55.140]  and as you can see in this video this intern came up to me. I think they're
[36:55.140 --> 36:58.260]  describing her as an intern. I don't really know who she is and attempted to
[36:58.260 --> 37:02.380]  take the microphone away from me. All I can say at that point is that I was
[37:02.380 --> 37:05.340]  trying to hang on to the microphone so I could continue to ask the president
[37:05.340 --> 37:10.660]  questions. Obviously I you know I didn't put my hands on her or touch her as
[37:10.660 --> 37:15.260]  they're alleging. If I may ask one other question. Are you worried?
[37:15.260 --> 37:22.100]  That's enough. That's enough. The other folks. Pardon me ma'am. Obviously I
[37:22.100 --> 37:26.700]  you know I didn't put my hands on her or touch her as they're alleging. The other
[37:26.700 --> 37:30.940]  folks. That's enough. You know I didn't put my hands on her or touch her as
[37:30.940 --> 37:35.540]  they're alleging. The other folks. That's enough. You know I didn't put my hands on
[37:35.540 --> 37:39.380]  her or touch her as they're alleging. The other folks. That's enough. I think
[37:39.380 --> 37:42.980]  that's under a very rude person. The way you treat Sarah Huckabee is horrible.
[37:42.980 --> 37:46.940]  All right and the way you. That's right we're gonna go back to the president's
[37:46.940 --> 37:50.380]  response just about an hour ago defending Paul Watson in the video just
[37:50.380 --> 37:53.740]  saying all we have is zooming in. That's not doctoring. That's showing even more
[37:53.740 --> 38:00.340]  clarity. That's enhancing for the truth. Binoculars don't make your eyes lie. They
[38:00.340 --> 38:04.860]  give you further vision. Rushing your teeth isn't attacking your teeth. It's
[38:04.860 --> 38:09.340]  helping them. I mean Paul this is insane. What has happened here? Are they just so
[38:09.340 --> 38:14.260]  used to lying that the lies now become so ridiculous that this is now blown up in
[38:14.260 --> 38:18.100]  their face but all over the place corporate media is still defending it?
[38:18.100 --> 38:22.500]  Well it's blown up in their face Alex. Some of them are having to backtrack but
[38:22.500 --> 38:26.420]  again it's such a bubble that they just regurgitate it and a lot of these hit
[38:26.420 --> 38:31.540]  pieces are just basically formulaic copies of the initial hit pieces so then
[38:31.540 --> 38:35.420]  it goes you know it spreads in that manner like a virus. But the fact is
[38:35.420 --> 38:41.580]  vice news. No fans of info wars. No fans of me. Certainly vice news. Talk to two
[38:41.580 --> 38:45.500]  forensic experts. I don't even need to talk about this because I know I didn't
[38:45.500 --> 38:49.860]  talk to the video. It's zoomed in. That's not doctoring but even they got two
[38:49.860 --> 38:53.740]  forensic experts who said that there's no evidence whatsoever that it was
[38:53.740 --> 38:59.020]  doctored. One of them is called Hany Farid who studies digital forensics
[38:59.020 --> 39:03.460]  human perception and image analysis. University of California Berkeley and he
[39:03.460 --> 39:07.300]  said he does not think the video was doctored. He agreed the entire video
[39:07.300 --> 39:10.780]  was of course slowed down and zoomed in to focus on the moment of physical
[39:10.780 --> 39:15.020]  contact but does not see any evidence to suggest that it was selectively edited
[39:15.020 --> 39:20.420]  to exaggerate the cost as motion. They had another guy from the University of
[39:20.420 --> 39:25.340]  Colorado called Jeff Smith who is another image analyst. They said he came to a
[39:25.340 --> 39:29.220]  similar conclusion. Smith told motherboard that he could detect duplicate
[39:29.220 --> 39:32.980]  frames in the White House video which could indicate it was doctored but
[39:32.980 --> 39:37.700]  then he went on to say that it wasn't. There are duplicate frames, two additional
[39:37.700 --> 39:40.740]  frames. Again that's due to video compression Alex as we talked about
[39:40.740 --> 39:44.660]  yesterday but he says otherwise the video is not slowed down doesn't appear to be
[39:44.660 --> 39:48.620]  altered on the pixel level as many people in the Twitterverse are claiming. So
[39:48.620 --> 39:52.820]  first Alex they said it was sped up then they said it was slowed down and now
[39:52.820 --> 39:56.340]  they're having to back away from that completely. The New York Times Alex
[39:56.340 --> 40:01.060]  today, because Colbert talked about this, Jimmy Kimmel talked about it, they all
[40:01.060 --> 40:06.740]  regurgitated it. New York Times reports today quote the video was sped up
[40:06.740 --> 40:10.700]  creating the illusion that Acosta have pushed the female in turn roughly. The
[40:10.700 --> 40:16.380]  video was not sped up even the forensic experts at Vice admit to that now
[40:16.380 --> 40:19.380]  they're saying oh it might have been slowed down like make your mind up
[40:19.380 --> 40:23.100]  seriously. This has blown up in their face Alex it's ridiculous. Paul how many
[40:23.100 --> 40:27.540]  times have I begged you though not to use the free crap video editor you have?
[40:27.540 --> 40:33.980]  What's that? Well because it grays the video and it does add skip frames so
[40:33.980 --> 40:37.140]  sometimes we get videos from you and there's little jumps and stuff. Obviously
[40:37.140 --> 40:41.220]  everybody sees the video they know it's the same length it's just a cruddy upload
[40:41.220 --> 40:46.820]  of it. It's the exact same length a few frames that got added by digital distortion
[40:46.820 --> 40:50.820]  doesn't even add a millisecond so it's the exact same link it is the video it
[40:50.820 --> 40:54.900]  just lost resolution because you uploaded it to Twitter and zoomed in period
[40:54.900 --> 41:00.500]  period period. Yeah and that's why everyone's now admits but again this this
[41:00.500 --> 41:03.940]  bubble is so intense that they're never gonna be able to retract it. It was a
[41:03.940 --> 41:09.780]  GIF image downloaded from Twitter exported as an M2T file then run
[41:09.780 --> 41:13.940]  through another program called Handbrake to make it back into an MP4 file so it
[41:13.940 --> 41:17.460]  could be uploaded to Twitter. So obviously it's not gonna be exactly the same
[41:17.460 --> 41:23.060]  with compression but it was not edited it was not doctored. They manufactured a
[41:23.060 --> 41:27.740]  complete hoax this was an international media hoax to distract from Acosta's
[41:27.740 --> 41:31.620]  behavior which as Trump said it wasn't horrible it wasn't a soul but it was
[41:31.620 --> 41:35.380]  certainly controversial it was a talking point and it reflected negatively on
[41:35.380 --> 41:39.540]  him so this is why they had to create an entirely new controversy to
[41:39.540 --> 41:43.020]  distract from it. And now the bigger scandal is Acosta saying he didn't touch
[41:43.020 --> 41:47.640]  her and the entire corporate media going along with the lie even when they
[41:47.640 --> 41:50.660]  talked to forensic experts buried the articles they go okay this is just
[41:50.660 --> 41:54.900]  compression it's real Acosta pushed her and you know pulled the microphone back
[41:54.900 --> 42:01.540]  just the fact that they even tried this Paul is just a next level BS. I mean
[42:01.540 --> 42:05.100]  they called it Orwellian they said they claimed that Sarah Sanders or the
[42:05.100 --> 42:08.260]  White House had edited the video and that was Orwellian. The Orwellian thing
[42:08.260 --> 42:13.620]  is like do you not have eyes can you not see his left arm come down and push her
[42:13.620 --> 42:18.940]  away physically restrain her overpower her? Did he touch her? Yes he touched her
[42:18.940 --> 42:22.100]  nobody's saying it's a salt but he touched her to claim otherwise there's an
[42:22.100 --> 42:26.580]  outright lie. And like any woman or any man overpowered by somebody else she
[42:26.580 --> 42:30.060]  looks to the president and the secret service like this dude just shoved my
[42:30.060 --> 42:33.740]  arm down and jerked the mic back what do I do now? Yeah you can see her
[42:33.740 --> 42:37.260]  immediate reaction is she's surprised by the fact that he's physically
[42:37.260 --> 42:41.300]  restraining her she didn't see that coming. Did he touch her? Yes he touched
[42:41.300 --> 42:46.100]  her. The video which is not doctored shows that. I mean I'm a man but if I was
[42:46.100 --> 42:50.180]  doing the mediation and a man pulled a mic back I wouldn't do it I'd call
[42:50.180 --> 42:54.180]  security or that's what she does. He manhandles her she looks at security. Paul let's come
[42:54.180 --> 42:59.260]  back though and play the president's defense of you stay with us. The
[42:59.260 --> 43:02.820]  globalists know that if they suppress the Good Halogen and pump the
[43:02.820 --> 43:07.100]  environment full of the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that
[43:07.100 --> 43:12.260]  it lowers IQ it literally dumps the population down. And on our quest to
[43:12.260 --> 43:16.060]  bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world we've gone through
[43:16.060 --> 43:21.220]  two permutations. First seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to
[43:21.220 --> 43:24.620]  source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it so we
[43:24.620 --> 43:29.220]  discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's
[43:29.220 --> 43:33.060]  been incredible. Now due to the establishment trying to block that we
[43:33.060 --> 43:37.500]  did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine
[43:37.500 --> 43:42.260]  but chemist scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it
[43:42.260 --> 43:47.780]  with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin C it super charges it
[43:47.780 --> 43:53.260]  and makes it even more bio available. Ladies and gentlemen you want to research
[43:53.260 --> 43:57.620]  it you want to see it it's an incredible discovery. X3 now available at
[43:57.620 --> 44:02.220]  enforcelife.com. As the years go by it gets harder and harder to keep up with

[47:28.380 --> 47:31.700]  want to be absolutely clear this is one of the biggest stories if not the
[47:31.700 --> 47:35.140]  biggest. They got more attention to the tragic shooting yesterday. They killed
[47:35.140 --> 47:40.900]  12 people. The PTSD Marine was posting to Instagram when he did it. Will they ban
[47:40.900 --> 47:46.140]  Instagram off of the internet now like they did Gab? No they won't. But a true
[47:46.140 --> 47:50.020]  tragedy. We've got all this big world news. We've got total election fraud, live
[47:50.020 --> 47:55.420]  feed with our reporters on the ground at infowars.com, newswars.com and we're
[47:55.420 --> 47:59.020]  gonna have Roger Stone from Broward County. There are trucks blocking the
[47:59.020 --> 48:02.540]  entrance as the Democrats try to bring in more 18 wheelers and trucks full of
[48:02.540 --> 48:07.900]  magic ballots that in some cases are 100% precincts reporting for Democrats so
[48:07.900 --> 48:11.300]  that they'll lose the Senate seat, they'll lose the House seat, they'll lose some of
[48:11.300 --> 48:15.820]  the other seats that the Republicans just won. This is incredible. The live feed
[48:15.820 --> 48:21.380]  is on infowars.com. It's happening right now. Can we go to infowars.com for
[48:21.380 --> 48:25.460]  folks? I want to pull it up on screen for TV viewers. One of the links you want to
[48:25.460 --> 48:31.260]  spread is at infowars.com. Okay, Democrats just got caught trying to
[48:31.260 --> 48:35.500]  steal back Florida and Arizona plus Trump defends info wars and more. Let's go
[48:35.500 --> 48:42.420]  back to infowars.com. The new live feed is a whole separate feed that I want to
[48:42.420 --> 48:47.940]  show TV viewers right now that's in the main featured area right there. I'll
[48:47.940 --> 48:52.100]  pull up my phone. Scroll down. We're gonna do this right now together. There it is
[48:52.100 --> 48:55.940]  right there. Look, that's the huge news right there. Four trucks block
[48:55.940 --> 49:03.900]  entrance to Broward County elections office as protest gather. We have Roger
[49:03.900 --> 49:09.020]  Stone and our reporters are on the ground now. That is coming up next hour.
[49:09.020 --> 49:13.540]  Election official meddling being investigated as dims just happened to
[49:13.540 --> 49:21.140]  find lost 18 wheelers and large trucks full of ballots. This is huge news. Get
[49:21.140 --> 49:24.740]  this out to everybody. It's been criminally investigated by Homeland
[49:24.740 --> 49:30.940]  Security. This is all happening right now. Ladies and gentlemen, let's go back to
[49:30.940 --> 49:34.860]  the president because even though this bowling thing is I've got a bowling clip
[49:34.860 --> 49:37.940]  of him interviewing the White House spokesperson on this, even though this
[49:37.940 --> 49:43.180]  whole thing with the cost of it is petty, the lying about it and the whole
[49:43.180 --> 49:47.340]  corporate media joining in to lie and the president having to shatter this
[49:47.340 --> 49:54.380]  whole illusion illustrates how these people work as a wall of fraud against
[49:54.380 --> 49:58.260]  America and against our recovery. They really are enemies of the American
[49:58.260 --> 50:01.860]  people. This is the real deal. Here is the president defending Paul Watson just
[50:01.860 --> 50:08.980]  hours ago. The tape video of Costa. What are you talking about? All that was
[50:08.980 --> 50:14.100]  nobody manipulated it. Give me a break. See, that's just dishonest reporting. All
[50:14.100 --> 50:18.860]  that is is a close up. See, that's just that is just dishonest reporting. I
[50:18.860 --> 50:23.060]  watched that. I heard that last night. They made it close up. They showed it
[50:23.060 --> 50:27.060]  close up and he was not nice to that young woman. I don't hold them for that
[50:27.060 --> 50:32.140]  because it wasn't overly, you know, horrible, but it was. But all that was
[50:32.140 --> 50:36.300]  when you say doctor, you're at dishonest guy because it wasn't doctored. They
[50:36.300 --> 50:43.740]  gave a close up view. That's not doctoring. There you go. Oh, I mean, the
[50:43.740 --> 50:49.260]  president at press conferences has to say it's not doctored. There's another
[50:49.260 --> 50:51.900]  White House statement we're going to release. A video we're going to play
[50:51.900 --> 50:54.660]  here in a moment that Eric Bowling just sent me. We appreciate him doing that
[50:54.660 --> 50:57.900]  where they responded. He said, look, we were all in there. We saw the video's
[50:57.900 --> 51:02.060]  real. It doesn't matter if it's sped up or slowed down or zoomed in. It's not
[51:02.060 --> 51:06.420]  doctored. Well, we didn't speed it up. All we did was blow it up. Paul, final
[51:06.420 --> 51:11.380]  comments on this. Final comments, Alex, is that I mean, there are so many
[51:11.380 --> 51:15.140]  liars out there today. Listen to this from Yahoo News. Okay, they quote me
[51:15.140 --> 51:19.580]  talking to Buzzfeed saying digitally it's going to look a tiny bit different
[51:19.580 --> 51:23.500]  after processing and zooming in. Elizabeth Loftus, professor of law and
[51:23.500 --> 51:27.660]  social psychology at the University of California Irvine, isn't buying it. The
[51:27.660 --> 51:31.860]  videos are totally different, she says. Alex, are these videos that you're
[51:31.860 --> 51:36.140]  playing right now totally different or do they look almost exactly the same?
[51:36.140 --> 51:41.140]  Elizabeth Loftus is a liar. Those videos are exactly the same. There's no
[51:41.140 --> 51:45.300]  doctoring. There's no speeding up. Now they're saying, oh, it was slowed down.
[51:45.300 --> 51:49.420]  It's like make your mind up seriously. But so many liars, the original tweets
[51:49.420 --> 51:55.220]  about this got literally like 60,000 retweets, Alex. The retractions or the
[51:55.220 --> 51:58.500]  debunking tweets got basically, you know, a couple of thousand here and there.
[51:58.500 --> 52:02.260]  So again, it's a huge echo chamber. They've convinced each other that this
[52:02.260 --> 52:05.740]  has doctored. It's like some grand conspiracy where they've deluded
[52:05.740 --> 52:09.500]  themselves into seeing something that's not even there. And then denying what
[52:09.500 --> 52:14.140]  actually is there, the fact that he put his hands on a woman that happened,
[52:14.140 --> 52:19.100]  everybody saw it. So we're talking about the king's new clothes. He has no clothes,
[52:19.100 --> 52:22.660]  you're calling it out, but everybody else says, no, he's wearing beautiful clothes.
[52:22.660 --> 52:26.380]  And finally a three-year-old walks up and says, no, the king's naked. And then
[52:26.380 --> 52:29.780]  everybody gets past the peer pressure and starts admitting it's true. But this
[52:29.780 --> 52:35.100]  time it's the king telling us that CNN has no clothes. And of course, that is
[52:35.100 --> 52:40.860]  President Trump. Paul, we thought, some people thought, I didn't think, but a lot
[52:40.860 --> 52:43.700]  of people thought that things would slow down after the election. No, they're
[52:43.700 --> 52:48.700]  only going into insane high gear and activating 900 terror squads in their
[52:48.700 --> 52:55.300]  own words, as violence escalates, as doxing escalates. We've got this new
[52:55.300 --> 52:58.220]  deputy attorney general who's now officially the attorney general,
[52:58.220 --> 53:02.740]  scaring the hell out of him. We've got his bio. He's a super patriot, Christian,
[53:02.740 --> 53:08.820]  literally dialed into what's going on. I've done deep research now. That's why
[53:08.820 --> 53:14.980]  they're so scared. Trump's making his move. Yeah. And I mean, the problem is, Alex,
[53:14.980 --> 53:18.340]  when there is extremism, when there is violence on the right, we call it out,
[53:18.340 --> 53:22.460]  we disavow, we distance ourselves from it. That doesn't happen on the left. And
[53:22.460 --> 53:25.940]  that's why this is all escalating, because they don't de-escalate it. They
[53:25.940 --> 53:30.660]  seek to escalate it at every available opportunity. There's a Vox employee,
[53:30.660 --> 53:38.060]  Matt Iglesias yesterday, who basically applauded Antifa stalking, harassing,
[53:38.060 --> 53:43.220]  terrorizing Tucker Carlson's wife and children as they literally had hid in
[53:43.220 --> 53:48.180]  a closet, according to reports, saying that basically they deserved it.
[53:48.180 --> 53:52.060]  He said, I think the idea behind terrorizing his family, like it or not,
[53:52.060 --> 53:55.060]  as a strategy is to make them feel some of the fear that the victims of
[53:55.060 --> 53:58.860]  MAGA inspired violence feel. So he basically applauded it and said that
[53:58.860 --> 54:03.380]  this was a good method. He's since deleted all these tweets, backed away from
[54:03.380 --> 54:07.660]  it. But again, this is the attitude on the left. They don't disavow their
[54:07.660 --> 54:11.380]  violent extremists, which is why this is escalating and getting worse.
[54:11.380 --> 54:16.300]  And they always lie and they always double down and they are getting worse.
[54:16.300 --> 54:19.660]  This is an insane time to be alive. Thank you, Paul Joseph Watson. We'll talk to you
[54:19.660 --> 54:26.820]  soon. Thanks. These controversies get more and more bizarre. I'm going to come
[54:26.820 --> 54:30.540]  back and get to this video. We're going to post some info wars.com.
[54:30.540 --> 54:34.460]  White House further responds to this controversy and they said, look, we were
[54:34.460 --> 54:39.540]  there. The video that in four shows is what we saw with our eyeballs and
[54:39.540 --> 54:47.780]  everyone else saw it too. Zooming in is not doctoring, but this is the level of
[54:47.780 --> 54:53.500]  1984 where they tell you two plus two does not equal four. And then we've got
[54:53.500 --> 54:56.900]  our crew already reporting live on the ground. Roger Stundler's a feed of Roger
[54:56.900 --> 55:00.340]  Stundler and others reporting live at info wars.com. Get that link out to
[55:00.340 --> 55:03.860]  everybody. That's how these feeds go viral. It's how we get around the sensors.
[55:03.860 --> 55:07.060]  There's so much other news I haven't gotten to yet. I tend to wait for the
[55:07.060 --> 55:10.540]  very end of the hour to even plug. If I get so obsessed with the news, but if you
[55:10.540 --> 55:15.940]  don't support info wars, you're missing out on really, really great products that
[55:15.940 --> 55:21.460]  spread the word like t-shirts and hoodies. And we've now got sweaters and info
[55:21.460 --> 55:26.380]  wars on them. We've got so many great mo on lobby style designs. We've got really
[55:26.380 --> 55:31.020]  in your face political stuff that'll get you in confrontations. It'll also help
[55:31.020 --> 55:34.180]  you meet a lot of people. But we've also got things that are covert info war
[55:34.180 --> 55:38.300]  symbols that are mo on lobby things that are only get you the positive feedback
[55:38.300 --> 55:42.540]  if you want to network with people and be on the DL. We've got our covert
[55:42.540 --> 55:47.820]  operations clothing and then we've got our open out, you know, basically drawing
[55:47.820 --> 55:52.460]  their fire type stuff and getting a t-shirt is so vital to what we do. Going
[55:52.460 --> 55:55.380]  to the political rallies, going to the Trump rallies, wearing them lets the
[55:55.380 --> 55:59.180]  establishment know that America is awake and is taking action and lets them
[55:59.180 --> 56:03.820]  know that we are the folks that brought Trump to the party, which he knows
[56:03.820 --> 56:09.940]  but his own minions don't. This is the relaunch of 1776. So getting t-shirts at
[56:09.940 --> 56:13.620]  infowarstore.com is critical and if you'll just get one for yourself, one for
[56:13.620 --> 56:17.260]  your wife, one for your neighbor, if you'll just do your Christmas shopping
[56:17.260 --> 56:20.740]  early at infowarstore.com, get it out of the way, don't bite the crowds, get a

[56:25.700 --> 56:30.460]  hoodie. We've got them with gold foil female cut that are just gorgeous. My
[56:30.460 --> 56:34.300]  wife looks amazing in one. I'd have her come in and do a photo shoot, my goodness.
[56:34.300 --> 56:39.420]  Start drilling though, but the point is infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com or
[56:39.420 --> 56:44.100]  triple eight two five three three one three nine. Yeah, no, my beautiful gorgeous
[56:44.100 --> 56:48.940]  wife with a little waist and everything else, but then the femininity and the
[56:48.940 --> 56:53.260]  and the mo on lobby, it's a big, it's a big, it's a big turn on, let's just, let's
[56:53.260 --> 56:55.820]  be honest. And then there's the supplements, ladies and gentlemen at
[56:55.820 --> 57:01.220]  infowarstore.com, we just ended our biggest sale in history. So kind of shut
[57:01.220 --> 57:03.740]  down our payment processing and put us out of business. So I'm like, everything
[57:03.740 --> 57:07.020]  must go. And we ran it for about two weeks and a lot of stuff got close to
[57:07.020 --> 57:11.140]  selling out. So it went back to the regular discounted prices, except on
[57:11.620 --> 57:16.380]  six items that we do have enough of in stock. Survival Shield X three, even
[57:16.380 --> 57:20.340]  better than X two, all three types of iodine, including the deep earth crystal.

[58:53.900 --> 58:57.820]  censorship and you saw 18 Twitter accounts they say affiliated with info
[58:57.820 --> 59:00.780]  wars. Yes some of them are like little side accounts they even know we had like
[59:00.780 --> 59:04.340]  info wars stores that just showed our products but they just banned them all
[59:04.340 --> 59:08.780]  yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these
[59:08.780 --> 59:12.140]  folks that loved us. Your excitement about America, your excitement about this
[59:12.140 --> 59:15.540]  broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick. But the
[59:15.540 --> 59:19.740]  globalists now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not
[59:19.740 --> 59:24.900]  pesky in the future. I want to be troublesome and pesky. I want to keep
[59:24.900 --> 59:29.420]  going. I want to make them do the ultimate not just destroy us financially. I
[59:29.420 --> 59:33.980]  want to push all the way. I've committed to do that. I've prayed for that and I've
[59:33.980 --> 59:37.620]  been told that's going to happen but you've got a back ish and I promise you
[59:37.620 --> 59:42.460]  this. I will never falter. I will never waver at the spiritual level. I physically

[59:53.020 --> 59:58.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:58.500 --> 01:00:15.740]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:38.740]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:15.780]  Well we've got live feeds for trucks block entrance to Bowerd County
[01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:20.340]  elections offices as protesters gather. Roger's been out there last night.
[01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:26.180]  Today he's got his operatives out there. He literally ran the operation for
[01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:30.220]  George W. Bush which is ashamed of now but he's brought as a top expert by
[01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:35.020]  Baker and Hostetler and was able to stop them stealing that election which they
[01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:39.980]  were doing. In hindsight we know it came out. They're doing it again. Broward
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:44.820]  County he thought on Tuesday night that they were going to steal it and he was
[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:47.740]  sure of that and then when they didn't he thought this is incredible they always
[01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:52.620]  do and then now the governorship the Senate race the ad commissioner that
[01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:56.820]  was all the Republicans now magically 18-wheelers have pulled up in other trucks
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:02:00.620]  and the Democrats are delivering precincts that are almost 100% demo rat.
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:05.460]  Wow big surprise there huh. All right we'll come back from the break with
[01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:10.620]  Roger Stone with the latest tomorrow's news today of the Democrats openly
[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:15.420]  trying to steal the election but here is Eric Boling talking to the White House
[01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:20.060]  spokesperson about the giant Jim Acosta info war scandal here it is. I called
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:25.740]  Alex Jones and it specifically asked him for a comment on whether you know
[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:28.940]  because his video came allegedly originated info wars and that's what
[01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:33.380]  they're saying and Alex Jones responded and we're gonna show this to our
[01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:37.420]  audience and Hogan I'll show you right now and this is what he had to say.
[01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:43.380]  Well CNN's Acosta got caught shoving and pushing a woman. The media says Trump's even
[01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:46.780]  bad if he tells a female reporter to stop interrupting him but that's some kind of
[01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:49.620]  assault. So what are they gonna do? They're gonna spin it. They're gonna say that we
[01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:53.820]  doctored the video and info wars. No we didn't ladies and gentlemen all we did
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:03:00.300]  was zoom in on the video so you can see that he's hitting her arm. The very same
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:04.860]  video was put out by the press secretary. We have doctored nothing. They're
[01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:09.260]  changing the subject. Jim Acosta made a fool of himself. He took over yet again
[01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:13.380]  that's all he does is grandstand. Now he's had his credentials revoked and so
[01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:17.060]  they're changing the subject saying that info wars oh look they're fake news they
[01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:21.780]  doctored the video. Zooming in on video is not doctoring it. Anybody can get their
[01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:26.700]  original video and zoom in themselves. We zoomed in so you could see it. That's the
[01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:31.180]  real news we're covering at info wars.com and news wars.com. Tomorrow's news
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:38.460]  today. So there you have it unique Alicia response from info wars and that's
[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:41.500]  that's Alex Jones who runs info wars saying they didn't doctored the video
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:44.940]  they just they focused in on what you'd pointed out that there was actual
[01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:49.740]  contact. Sure and again I can't speak to the origin of the video except to say
[01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:52.740]  I know where it started. It started right in that room over there when
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:56.620]  everyone saw it. It doesn't matter who puts it up who posts it. It doesn't matter
[01:03:56.620 --> 01:04:00.620]  the speed at which the video is seen. It doesn't matter the angle. The question is
[01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:06.020]  at the core of this and this is why Jim Acosta lost his credential. Did he touch
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:09.820]  her or not. The video is clear he did. He did. Who made the decision to pull his
[01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:14.780]  credentials. It was an internal decision. The president was internally in the
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:17.500]  oval week. Now we talked about it as a team and that was a decision. That's
[01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:20.220]  true.
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:29.100]  And we are back live ladies and gentlemen broadcasting worldwide. We're gonna break
[01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:38.180]  and come back with Roger Stone with the latest Democrat raping of America. We've
[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:41.300]  seen the fraud with the three of the five women now admitting that they never
[01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:45.580]  even met Cavanaugh and never touched him. But he deserves it. He's a bad person.
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:51.260]  So they made it all up and now they're trying to steal Arizona and Florida with
[01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:54.700]  magic trucks that show up days later after the elections closed that they
[01:04:54.700 --> 01:05:24.540]  found under a toadstool.
[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:27.900]  Now because of their intensifying censorship it's more important than ever
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:33.580]  that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so
[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:37.500]  there's no way the sensors can get between us with critical videos articles
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:42.660]  breaking news intel you name it. And so now I ask you more than ever to share
[01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:46.620]  the infowars.com articles to share the videos to tell people by the local
[01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:50.060]  stations you're listening to. The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the
[01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:55.900]  free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter. We are the Renaissance
[01:05:55.900 --> 01:06:16.140]  and we are winning.
[01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:26.300]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones. Well I can't believe
[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:34.100]  that the top news story yesterday was Alex Jones and infowars doctor fake a
[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:41.780]  cost of video of him assaulting a woman. Just total lies. We never said it was
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:45.620]  assault. We said he chopped down her hand pushed her away pulled the microphone
[01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:50.580]  away. He says he never even touched her. The video he says is fake. I can't believe
[01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:53.900]  that's the top story. I can't believe he did it in front of the whole world on a
[01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:58.860]  dozen live feeds. The president says no info wars didn't doctor it. They zoomed
[01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:02.860]  in as you can see it clear. It's the exact same length the exact same everything
[01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:07.380]  nothing's been edited other than zooming it in and uploading it to Twitter. But
[01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:12.780]  they've got every psychology professor that doesn't even know how to set their
[01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:19.700]  digital watch. Much less edit video. In the news saying no this is psychological
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:24.580]  warfare. Jim Acosta wasn't even there basically. He was on another planet when
[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:29.620]  all this happened. This signifies the next level of their insanity. You've
[01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:35.740]  also seen anti-fogo and docs all the Fox News people. Now the list has expanded.
[01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:38.580]  That's coming up at the bottom of the hour and now they're calling for
[01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:42.540]  violence. They're lazing the targets so that other crazies can go attack the
[01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:46.860]  houses. I can tell you the Carlson's have had to move out of their house. Roger
[01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:52.340]  Stone is close friends with Tucker Carlson and Tucker visited us a few times
[01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:56.460]  years ago after he kind of woke up with the New World Order and then I've had
[01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:59.260]  dinner with him with Roger a few times and I've gotten a normal bit behind the
[01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:01.500]  scenes. I don't want to get him in too much trouble but we talked quite a bit.
[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:08.060]  That said he's moved out of his house for now. So that's the level that these
[01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:12.820]  things have turned into. Where we're gonna get into that information. We knew
[01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:18.220]  that Alexandra Cortez was gonna be really entertaining. She started off with
[01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:22.740]  some big whoppers. That's coming up bottom of the hour. As she says it's not
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:26.060]  fair. She's not paid enough to be in Congress and hasn't gotten her check
[01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:30.020]  yet. When she's been photographed in all these designer clothes that cost each
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:34.900]  outfit three to six thousand dollars. She wears one thousand two thousand and
[01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:40.420]  three thousand dollar shoes. They have rained cash down on her. And now though
[01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:44.980]  she's bitching that for two months she doesn't have money for an apartment. This
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:48.620]  is all just to get her constituents thinking oh yes we're all about to get
[01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:53.940]  free stuff. What a sickening joke. She has she comes from a rich family just like
[01:08:53.940 --> 01:09:00.060]  Beto. Giant silver spoon crammed down her throat and she's just bitching at
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:05.020]  everybody. It's unbelievable. And we have the bizarreness of again Trump having
[01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:08.380]  defended info wars and saying zooming in is not doctoring. If anything it's
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:14.380]  showing clarity. It's unbelievable. So we're gonna get into that. We're gonna
[01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:21.780]  get into everything here. It is just insane. But I've got Roger Stone riding
[01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:27.420]  shotgun with us for much of the hour. He is the expert on Democrat election fraud.
[01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:33.420]  You can say he's the expert and he's the expert on Broward County in Florida. He's
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:41.820]  the guy for Baker and Hostetler that the Bushes brought in to stop Al Gore from
[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:45.060]  stealing the election. Again he doesn't like George W. I don't like George W. He
[01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:49.020]  woke up after that wrote books exposing him. But back then he was the head guy on
[01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:52.620]  the ground. Okay like he was the head general on the ground. James Baker was
[01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:57.220]  back floating around in Houston and DC you know running it but it was the main
[01:09:57.220 --> 01:10:03.580]  field general was Roger Stone. So he lives there for decades. His sons in
[01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:07.060]  the police force and the sheriff's department he knows all the inside
[01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:10.260]  baseball and he said Tuesday night he said I believe they're gonna steal it
[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:12.940]  the way they're not announcing at the end. Then he said well I think they thought
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:16.740]  they were gonna get caught so they didn't do it. But he goes I think they may
[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:19.460]  still pull something and just as he said it's happened. He's been there last
[01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:24.180]  night. They're today we've got live feeds in infowars.com. The trucks coming in
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:28.300]  protesters trying to block the magic trucks. Heard of magic carpets. These are
[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:32.780]  magic trucks. Donald Trump says in the 40s are investigating possible election
[01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:37.300]  fraud in Florida. It's all up for grabs now. The same thing is happening in
[01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:43.260]  Arizona. I tell you Roger they were smart to concede but then really not
[01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:47.540]  technically concede. So we all moved along. I mean these folks are deceptive
[01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:53.220]  man. They then they're getting more wily about it aren't they. Well Alex it's
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:58.060]  really an extraordinary situation. We had a meeting last night of attorneys
[01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:03.580]  and activists and others with extensive experience in vote counts both here in
[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:09.820]  Florida and elsewhere. I watched Don Lemon pummel some small poor woman
[01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:14.020]  online when she tried to make the case that there's a history of voter fraud
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:18.340]  in this county. But let me point out that in the Democratic primary for
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:24.620]  Congress two years ago between Deborah Wasserman Schultz and progressive Tim
[01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:30.180]  Canova a Bernie Sanders supporter a lawsuit proved that the board of
[01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:35.420]  elections had hidden and destroyed ballots. They won that lawsuit and then
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:40.380]  before the court ordered recount could take place the Broward County board of
[01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:46.140]  elections under the direction of Brenda Snipes destroyed all of the evidence. So
[01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:51.820]  we have a New York Post story yesterday reporting that a box of provisional
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:57.140]  ballots was mysteriously found by a school teacher and turned over to the
[01:11:57.140 --> 01:12:02.700]  Broward County board of elections. In the recent Republican primary for
[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:07.300]  Congress within Broward County the Broward County board of elections
[01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:13.100]  refuses to give the candidates or the party's account a breakdown of the early
[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:18.940]  vote, a breakdown of the absentee vote, a breakdown of the election day vote. In
[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:25.300]  some precincts more Republicans voted than are registered Alex. So this is a
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:29.980]  this is a county with a history of you mean you mean you mean more Democrats
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:36.020]  voted than were them were. No I mean in the recent Republican primary. So there
[01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:40.820]  there's just more and more historical evidence of corruption in this county
[01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:45.660]  and therefore those who are saying oh the Republicans speak of voter fraud with
[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:50.460]  no history or evidence there's a long and rich history. That's right. It's been found in court
[01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:53.700]  repeatedly. Now you are the expert you live there you run a lot of elections
[01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:57.420]  there a lot of campaigns. I mean I could not think of a better person to be here
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:00.500]  other than if we can get the Democrats that are famous for stealing to have
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:05.140]  them come on and admit to what they're doing. People are not buying this. I
[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:10.020]  mean I covered all the elections as you know for 20 plus years Roger and over
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:13.540]  and over again in Broward County they magically trucks are found. They're
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:18.460]  always trying trucks in Democrat party hands that are almost all magically
[01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:24.700]  votes for the Democrats. I mean and then a a phalanx of a train of trucks then all
[01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:29.500]  show up and are driving in to deliver a Senate seat, a governor's seat and some
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:35.100]  other seats the Democrats. This is unbelievably ridiculous. Well and last
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:40.740]  night I publicly urged Governor Rick Scott to order the Florida Department of
[01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:46.300]  Law Enforcement that's our state police to impound the ballots immediately to
[01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:51.780]  take control of the ballots immediately. It has been reported that he has done so.
[01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:58.060]  I hope that report is correct. Now in all honesty my next piece of advice for the
[01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:04.380]  governor would be to replace Brenda Snipes the chairman or the director of the
[01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:08.820]  County Board of Elections which he has the authority to do and could do so on
[01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:13.900]  the basis of the irregularities in the recent Republican Congressional
[01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:18.500]  primary and the Democratic Congressional primary in which Tim Kanova was
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:24.620]  cheated two years ago. Now were he to do that I would recommend that he appoint
[01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:30.220]  an African-American Democrat to conduct this recount but someone with an
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:35.540]  impeccable reputation for integrity and honesty. There are several fine
[01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:41.020]  possibilities on the bench right here in Broward County or the former chairman of
[01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:47.300]  the State Bar Association, Democrats, African-Americans, but people of impeccable
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:52.060]  integrity and honesty who will get Austin honest count be that which
[01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:59.100]  it may. That would be the shrewdest course of action because of course if
[01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:04.100]  Scott removes Brenda Snipes with her long record of incompetence and
[01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:09.820]  corruption he'll be accused of racism unless he replaces her someone with
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:13.380]  someone who's also an African-American. But I mean I don't think people will buy it
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:17.380]  either way because Broward County is probably the most famous county other
[01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:23.300]  than the county that Chicago's in from stealing elections. I mean as you said
[01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:26.820]  it's like if there's a guy on the street convicted three times of arson and
[01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:30.900]  then somebody's house mysteriously burns down next door to him you know the guy
[01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:33.620]  you go talk to is the guy who's got a long history of it and then you've got
[01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:38.380]  the trucks like appearing out of some leprechauns pot of gold for the
[01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:44.540]  Democrats this is ridiculous these people are unbelievable the bottom line
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:48.900]  they're stealing it again people are sick of this crap they need to take action
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:53.380]  and again the man quarterbacking advising the governor joins us right now
[01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:56.940]  he don't want to brag that's what's happening we'll be right back stay with us
[01:15:56.940 --> 01:16:02.020]  hear that that's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves
[01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:07.860]  ransacked the place and what they don't steal will be destroyed this year
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:12.940]  resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in go to fake TV.com and discover

[01:18:56.500 --> 01:19:02.300]  info or store living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:06.460]  real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big
[01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:11.140]  island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:16.660]  volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the
[01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:21.660]  pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:27.260]  for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact
[01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:32.380]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested
[01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:36.700]  the water from our alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal
[01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:42.100]  levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as
[01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:47.940]  it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what
[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:52.180]  we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater
[01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:59.180]  supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:05.980]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:11.980]  you

[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:53.300]  incredible histories of cover-ups stand-downs corruption
[01:20:53.300 --> 01:21:01.580]  muzzle trust alice acrylic muzzle trust beelzebub bathomet the old serpent and
[01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:05.660]  of course you've got the head of the election board who again is the most
[01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:12.260]  famous person in the united states living for stealing elections and
[01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:19.660]  magically the cavalry has arrived what is it five big panel trucks they say
[01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:24.500]  more is coming whatever amount they need they just blow the bugle and here
[01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:30.340]  comes the cavalry over the hill roger stone what else should the governor do
[01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:35.540]  what do you expect to happen how insane is this going to get well there's a lot
[01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:40.900]  of things that are perplexing here alex the the liberals and the left are
[01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:46.220]  mobilizing large numbers of protesters the white house is actively urging people
[01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:52.340]  not to protest i think personally that that is an error i was at a meeting of
[01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:57.460]  about 120 people this morning there are many many activists from across the
[01:21:57.460 --> 01:22:03.820]  state headed to broward county for peaceful protests this weekend i obviously
[01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:09.500]  getting many text messages and emails advocating another brooks brothers riot
[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:15.300]  but the brooks brothers riot was specifically caused by the fact that
[01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:20.380]  democratic commissioners were seeking to remove ballots from a public space and
[01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:26.260]  take them to a place where there were no observers from either party or the media
[01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:33.140]  a violation of florida state sunshine law we have not yet seen that it's not
[01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:39.260]  i am not the point person for the governor but i am most certainly doing
[01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:43.540]  my party duty because i have extensive no i don't talk to you some and others
[01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:47.860]  mean you guys are the brains on the ground of the faithful patriots and you
[01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:52.580]  guys are putting out reports and advising people well and we have to
[01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:57.420]  because there seems to be the state republican party seems to be frozen in
[01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:02.540]  its response and i have extensive recount experience both in new jersey in
[01:23:02.540 --> 01:23:08.300]  the 1981 governor's race at which tom cain won by 1200 votes out of 2 million
[01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:14.620]  and of course in the florida recount of 2000 the great miss nomer that the
[01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:18.740]  brooks brothers riot was an attempt to stop the count no we were trying to stop
[01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:23.180]  the same group of ballots from be counted read being recounted for the
[01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:29.580]  third time in a in a feudal effort to find and invent additional votes for al
[01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:37.460]  gore they were really smart this time as you were sure Tuesday that they were
[01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:40.820]  going to come in with the extra ballots and find some but it just looks like
[01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:45.700]  they hadn't stuffed enough or they hadn't gotten prepared yet or why did they
[01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:50.020]  wait a few days hoping we weren't looking and what was the plan well let's
[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:55.260]  not lose sight of the fact that based on her long track record brenda snipes is
[01:23:55.260 --> 01:24:01.860]  not only corrupt she's also incompetent not very good at what she does that that
[01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:06.740]  is why the cover-up in the recent congressional primary is significant
[01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:13.940]  because both after it was proven in court that snipes had cheated progressive
[01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:17.500]  tim canova in the congressional race against washington schultz two years
[01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:23.340]  ago there were calls for the governor to remove her he did not do so after this
[01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:27.980]  recent fiasco in the republican congressional primary which makes no
[01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:32.420]  sense at all because the candidate who waged essentially no campaign won the
[01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:37.180]  primary against two better organized and better funded candidates and we can't
[01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:42.100]  even get a breakdown of early vote absentee vote election day vote all
[01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:46.340]  they'll do is give you a grand total and believe it or not alex when the
[01:24:46.340 --> 01:24:51.580]  candidates asked for what is under law they're publicly entitled to the the
[01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:54.300]  broward county board of elections says well if you want that you're gonna have
[01:24:54.300 --> 01:25:00.660]  to sue us and indeed a lawsuit was filed this morning this is important subtext
[01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:05.780]  for people like dom lemon who think that that you know are the claims of voter
[01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:12.460]  corruption are being somehow invented the new york post story about the finding
[01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:17.220]  of a box of provisional ballots is disturbing to me I don't know how many
[01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:23.260]  ballots that is is it ten thousand ballots is it 23 thousand ballots let's
[01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:30.180]  recognize broward county is an enormous county this is the largest I think urban
[01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:36.860]  county outside of Miami Dade well and therefore a few precincts is thousands
[01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:39.780]  and thousands of votes that's right we're gonna come back and only get into
[01:25:39.780 --> 01:25:42.980]  other big controversies with you what's happening in the house these other
[01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:47.060]  races strategies for the president this new incredible deputy attorney general
[01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:51.820]  that I've done research on who is just a Christian nationalist super savvy
[01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:55.140]  patriot I'm not gonna say or because I don't want to give them any cannon fodder
[01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:58.860]  but I know folks that know him and we're this is really the best guy this
[01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:03.460]  Trump's really done his homework with the new acting attorney general and
[01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:06.300]  hopefully he gets to stay in that position we've got two months to act
[01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:09.980]  though so we're gonna talk about that when we come back and he posted it should
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:17.740]  an expanded hit list and more before I do that listeners I want to be able to
[01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:22.980]  hire more crew to go 24 hours a day now all the enemy attacks the things they've
[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:27.780]  done in the fake lawsuits and the rest of it it slowed us down this year but I
[01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:32.100]  intend by the end of the year to launch another three-hour show 7 to 10 I want
[01:26:32.100 --> 01:26:34.260]  to be able to take care of the crew they're awesome people and I want to be
[01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:41.700]  able to hire more folks we've knocked out 15 of the 20 fake lawsuits that never
[01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:47.780]  gets covered when I knock one out Soros funds them but we are winning and we're
[01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:51.980]  moving forward and we're defeating the globalist but we need your hopes we need
[01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:55.380]  your prayers we use your word of mouth to continue because you spread the word
[01:26:55.380 --> 01:27:00.660]  person-to-person is unstoppable and we need you to buy products so many listeners
[01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:04.780]  steadfastly love the products to get the products but we know that a tiny
[01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:11.380]  percent of our amazing listenership and viewership actually goes to m4store.com
[01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:18.860]  that is a five-star high-security quality site with amazing supplements amazing
[01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:23.180]  patriot clothing amazing water filtration air filtration it is all the best my
[01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:27.980]  philosophy is find the best water filters that I get for the lowest price
[01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:33.140]  find the best air filtration for the lowest price find the best supplements
[01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:37.300]  already the best brands either private label them or soup up the best brands and
[01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:42.020]  then have it for a lower price that's what I do and then I get into the system
[01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:45.500]  where I discount things all the time to where now I've got to go to super total
[01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:49.900]  discounts where some things are lost leaders to bring in the big crowd so
[01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:53.260]  that we're able to sell the amount we need to find the operations become a
[01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:56.940]  catch-22 and I'm not really a I don't go to school for marketing or whatever I
[01:27:56.940 --> 01:28:02.460]  I just think hey really good prices sales sell stuff you go so low you've got to
[01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:08.900]  sell so much to even make a profit that it becomes a catch-22 what equalizes that
[01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:12.860]  equation to make sure we can be strong moving to the future is that you go get

[01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:47.700]  like this is insane that's what we do x3 better than x2 the original deep breath
[01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:51.260]  crystals we got another source even deeper even pure but then add a tiny bit
[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:55.100]  of the two others because it makes it better and a tiny bit of vitamin C to

[01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:58.580]  it's too late. Unleash the supermail in you supermail vitality at infowarstore.com
[01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:05.820]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:21.380]  just a good old boy never meaning no harm
[01:33:21.380 --> 01:33:28.380]  he told you never saw them in trouble with the law so today they were born
[01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:40.140]  straight in the curves, yeah, flying in the hills. Someday the mountain might get over the law never will.
[01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:46.460]  I was Troy a riding shotgun with me. Roger Stone riding shotgun from Florida
[01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:50.540]  they're covering the Democrats trying to open and steal the election next
[01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:53.860]  segment after Roger leaves us everyone wants to stay with us he's welcome
[01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:58.140]  because I wanted to see this. Media matters and others have gone to the next
[01:33:58.140 --> 01:34:07.500]  level these I guess anti-Trump black people when you're at the Smithsonian
[01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:13.100]  saying oh look the jobs are up it's great Trump's got great polling numbers
[01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:21.260]  with black Americans that comes over bumps you get to your face and the
[01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:26.460]  media matters cuts that off the front it says you're dehumanizing and attacking
[01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:31.100]  an innocent black family that's coming up next segment and man that's what's
[01:34:31.100 --> 01:34:38.820]  dangerous about this is they then publish this all over the country in the
[01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:43.100]  world and call for Owen to be taken off Facebook and Twitter now for bullying a
[01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:49.620]  poor black family oh and he bullied Balazi Ford a CIA operative whose story
[01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:54.500]  had more holes in it than a colander or Swiss cheese who defamed a man and now
[01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:58.180]  three of the other women have said it was all a fraud you don't talk about a
[01:34:58.180 --> 01:35:01.900]  public figure who goes up in front of the Senate and says somebody raped her
[01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:10.020]  with zero evidence and zero proof these people are unbelievable but that's all
[01:35:10.020 --> 01:35:14.660]  coming up next segment I wanted to play this clip and get Roger's take on it
[01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:18.900]  because it isn't about us it is about us but I wouldn't be covering this story
[01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:23.500]  about us if it wasn't so key like a Rosetta Stone or a skeleton key as I've
[01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:27.660]  called it that gives you a window into everything that a costa in front of
[01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:33.180]  dozens of live feeds pushes her arm down pulls back from her she turns look at
[01:35:33.180 --> 01:35:40.660]  security it'll help me what do I do he's taking the mic from me and then that
[01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:44.020]  turns into we edited the video because we blew it up and then they have
[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:48.060]  thousands of mainstream media and on co-bear and all the night shows say we
[01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:51.740]  got caught in line a costa didn't even touch her and a costa goes on TV and said
[01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:56.100]  I never touched her when he's lying and then they say we didn't see it this is
[01:35:56.100 --> 01:36:02.780]  beyond 1984 this is beyond two plus two doesn't equal four so let's play the
[01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:06.380]  president here and then get Roger Stone's take on them and move into Antifa and
[01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:10.220]  some other subject with both you gentlemen but here it is the tape video of
[01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:17.260]  costa what are you talking about all that was nobody manipulated it give me a
[01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:21.860]  break see that's just dishonest reporting all that is is a close-up see
[01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:26.340]  that's just that is just dishonest reporting I watched that I heard that
[01:36:26.340 --> 01:36:31.020]  last night they made it close up they showed it close up and he was not nice
[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:35.540]  to that young woman I don't hold them for that because it wasn't overly you
[01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:39.460]  know horrible but it was but all that was when you say doctor you're a
[01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:44.340]  dishonest guy because it wasn't doctored they gave a close-up view that's not
[01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:49.540]  doctrine came out and said that we doctored it were horrible people and
[01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:53.300]  that he didn't touch her so they they defended him on multiple channels not
[01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:57.100]  all the Fox News but but some of them MSNBC they all lied about us there's the
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:37:00.140]  president telling the truth getting what what really went on and he's even be a
[01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:03.940]  nice to a costa Lewandowski barely brushes into a woman they claim you know
[01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:08.660]  he broke her arm or whatever they have six frames here we have in front of God
[01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:11.580]  in the whole world standing in front of the president he's doing it in front of
[01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:15.540]  millions of live TV viewers we have it in HD watch and blows it up so you can
[01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:19.420]  see up close and that becomes editing which technically it is but it's not
[01:37:19.420 --> 01:37:25.820]  doctoring Owen shroyer Roger Stone well I think we should be focusing on the
[01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:29.660]  victim here at this this nice young gal that was just trying to do her job and
[01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:32.980]  you can see though I mean I don't know how young this girl is she's probably
[01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:37.180]  pretty young you can see the horrific look she has in her face when when a
[01:37:37.180 --> 01:37:41.100]  costa rips her arm down and pulls the mic back I mean she's stunned she doesn't
[01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:44.980]  know what to do so I think we should be giving a lot more credence to the victim
[01:37:44.980 --> 01:37:49.300]  in this situation well exactly under Democrat rules because Lewandowski
[01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:53.300]  brushed into the lady they call that brutal assault according to their
[01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:56.820]  metrics this he murdered that girl a costa murdered her in front of the
[01:37:56.820 --> 01:37:59.780]  president he didn't but but that's what they would say according to their
[01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:03.660]  metrics I mean Blasey Ford had no proof nobody her whole story didn't check out
[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:08.620]  all the witnesses said the opposite so with the credibility here we could say
[01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:12.900]  with more credibility a costa raped her well I mean there is more evidence that
[01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:16.500]  a costa assaulted this woman we can't see below the waist how do we know he
[01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:19.620]  wasn't raping her at the same time I'm not saying that folks I'm illustrating
[01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:24.340]  how absurd they are Roger Stone yeah let me put this another way Alex I think
[01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:32.260]  it's important in no way has this video been altered zooming in on it is not
[01:38:32.260 --> 01:38:37.460]  doctoring slowing the speed down so you can see what happens very quickly is not
[01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:44.260]  doctoring this video has not been altered it is a true depiction on video of
[01:38:44.260 --> 01:38:51.260]  what actually happened and anyone who says otherwise it is spinning I and the
[01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:55.300]  president was forthright and he's absolutely correct the video produced by
[01:38:55.300 --> 01:39:01.780]  him for wars was not altered in any way it was simply a zoom so you could get a
[01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:06.660]  closer look and slowed down because the whole thing happened so quickly this is
[01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:11.420]  the one of the most egregious examples of fake news that I have ever seen the
[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:18.660]  attack on this video is 100% fake news I'll tell you costa is the enemy of
[01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:24.140]  truth and but see the whole media line up behind him and go with the hoax to me
[01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:29.540]  this is like a major watermark in history the costa event because everybody I
[01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:33.460]  know including Democrats and others are saying no this is insane they're lying
[01:39:33.460 --> 01:39:39.820]  he did do that well you know honesty I spoke to two CNN reporters last night
[01:39:39.820 --> 01:39:44.420]  who kept insisting over and over again that the video had been doctored which
[01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:48.820]  is just a that's just a falsehood it was not altered in any way what they're
[01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:53.900]  really upset about Alex is the firing of Jeff Sessions and the president grabbing
[01:39:53.900 --> 01:40:00.820]  control of his own Justice Department at long last obscured the entire staged
[01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:08.540]  story of juvenile childish provocative behavior by Jim Acosta this was designed
[01:40:08.540 --> 01:40:13.820]  to be the big news story that day and it got completely subsumed by the
[01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:19.180]  president's dramatic decision to essentially fire Jeff Sessions and a
[01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:23.980]  point an attorney general who seems to me to be determined to reign in the
[01:40:23.980 --> 01:40:28.060]  excesses of the Mueller and that brings us to the real enchilada I've been
[01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:32.500]  distracted by the Acosta it is a petty thing but it's a window into how dumb
[01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:35.580]  they think we are and that's why it's so incredibly important it's petty but the
[01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:38.820]  lies they told saying he didn't even touch her that we fake the whole video
[01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:43.780]  that's all like a cartoon graphic it is just next level let's get into this new
[01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:47.420]  attorney general I've been researching him this new deputy general Matthew G
[01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:52.300]  Whitaker boy no wonder the deep state scared Roger yeah first of all he's an
[01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:57.060]  amazingly competent guy he served as the chief of staff for the Justice
[01:40:57.060 --> 01:41:03.940]  Department under Attorney General John Ashcroft he was himself a US attorney in
[01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:11.420]  Iowa he is very close to a former governor Terry Branstad who is currently
[01:41:11.420 --> 01:41:17.900]  serves as our ambassador to China a very good man and he is politically savvy and
[01:41:17.900 --> 01:41:22.780]  that's what they're upset about he's both legally savvy and politically savvy so
[01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:26.860]  they're now complaining that because he has expressed political views in the
[01:41:26.860 --> 01:41:31.020]  in the past in which he said in his opinion Hillary should have been
[01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:36.820]  indicted regarding her lies in the missing email scandal so to put this in
[01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:42.900]  perspective it is okay for the Mueller prosecution force to have multiple
[01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:46.980]  Democratic activists who work for Hillary Clinton and who have written
[01:41:46.980 --> 01:41:51.820]  things in support of the Clinton or donated money to the Clintons that's
[01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:56.980]  perfectly all right but Trump's appointees must be apolitical that is
[01:41:56.980 --> 01:42:01.860]  nonsense and they go further they were saying in the in the text messages and
[01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:05.620]  things that came out saying we're gonna stop Trump we're gonna insurance policy
[01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:10.780]  we can't let him get in they tried to defend that so that is frothingly biased
[01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:15.100]  and trying to set people up in fact I want to do more on this and then we'll
[01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:19.380]  get into the media matters caught literally doctoring a video in the
[01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:22.980]  classic sense editing out someone confronting you getting in your face
[01:42:22.980 --> 01:42:26.460]  for no reason and then your measured response this is gonna be really
[01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:30.860]  important but I'm gonna tell folks on the other side what little birdie word he's
[01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:36.500]  told me about why the deep state is so scared of Matthew G. Whittaker and we'll
[01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:40.140]  see Roger with his incredible sources what he thinks on the other side and then
[01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:45.100]  Owen we have his take and then we will show you what real doctoring looks like
[01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:48.180]  for radio listeners I'll break it down and describe it but you'll be able to hear
[01:42:48.180 --> 01:42:53.500]  it as well tomorrow's news today news wars.com info wars.com whatever you do

[01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:05.020]  we need to go back and we visit the foundations of our freedom our freedoms
[01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:07.740]  don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper it
[01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:11.300]  consists of the things that we're willing to fight for the First Amendment the
[01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:14.780]  Bill of Rights the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions they're
[01:43:14.780 --> 01:43:19.380]  prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking
[01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:23.180]  those God-given rights from us as individuals you better understand that
[01:43:23.180 --> 01:43:26.580]  because they're taking them right now
[01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:32.060]  we have seen what they want to do they called it UN Agenda 21 now they call it
[01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:37.100]  the UN 2030 Agenda they want everybody off of the rural lands they want people
[01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:41.380]  out of the suburbs they want to pack everybody into the cities because that's
[01:43:41.380 --> 01:43:47.180]  where it is easiest for them to control everyone it's the David Knight show
[01:43:47.180 --> 01:43:53.180]  I never missed your show, any day, any what? I mean never
[01:43:53.180 --> 01:43:56.740]  editfors.com forward slash show
[01:43:56.740 --> 01:44:00.740]  the globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the
[01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:04.300]  environment full of the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it
[01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:10.140]  that it lowers IQ it literally dumbs the population down and on our quest to
[01:44:10.140 --> 01:44:13.940]  bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world we've gone through
[01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:18.980]  two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard
[01:44:18.980 --> 01:44:22.500]  to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it so we
[01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:27.100]  discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought UX2 that's
[01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:30.940]  been incredible now due to the establishment trying to block that we
[01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:35.380]  did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine
[01:44:35.380 --> 01:44:40.140]  but chemists scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it
[01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:45.700]  with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin C it supercharges it
[01:44:45.700 --> 01:44:51.180]  and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research
[01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:55.540]  it you want to see it it's an incredible discovery x3 now available at

[01:46:22.740 --> 01:46:26.980]  break but the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from
[01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:32.620]  so that we're not pesky in the future I want to be troublesome and pesky I want
[01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:37.260]  to keep going I want to make them do the ultimate not just destroy us financially

[01:46:50.380 --> 01:46:54.620]  will but I give you my commitment if you financially support us at foreshore.com
[01:46:54.620 --> 01:46:59.500]  to give you my absolute total commitment
[01:46:59.500 --> 01:47:23.500]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:36.640]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. the 3 p.m. I'm here live I'm Alex Jones your
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:40.540]  host this is the most banned the most hated the most demonized the most lied
[01:47:40.540 --> 01:47:47.220]  about broadcast in the world by who the globalist the chai comms hollywood the
[01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:52.140]  Democratic Party the blue blood neocon establishment all the insiders that
[01:47:52.140 --> 01:47:56.140]  want to control everything and milk everything and and and cheat everything
[01:47:56.140 --> 01:48:04.500]  now why are they so scared of the new acting AG who's got too much really got
[01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:08.060]  200 plus days under the law but two months for sure before this new house
[01:48:08.060 --> 01:48:13.180]  gets in this new Congress gets in to really clean house who is Matthew G
[01:48:13.180 --> 01:48:16.340]  Whitaker and why are they so scared Roger will give us his take when he's
[01:48:16.340 --> 01:48:20.540]  leaving us we're gonna get into media matters caught in massive doctoring a
[01:48:20.540 --> 01:48:24.500]  video of Owen Schreuer and attempt to silence him so this is really criminal
[01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:29.660]  activity in my view and I'll explain why but first why are they so scared of
[01:48:29.660 --> 01:48:35.300]  this new acting Attorney General and how do we make sure he maximizes the time
[01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:40.540]  and effort he's got in there for sure 200 plus days or so with the recess law
[01:48:40.540 --> 01:48:44.740]  that's there and if Congress doesn't acting and stay longer well I know why
[01:48:44.740 --> 01:48:49.140]  and Roger just said it showing the great political research Roger does he said
[01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:53.460]  at last segment this guy worked for the governor is very close friends who knows
[01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:57.140]  about the Chinese Communist threat has been deployed to China so they know we're
[01:48:57.140 --> 01:49:01.620]  not playing games they try to buy off whoever you send over there so these are
[01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:05.460]  tough cookies he knows about the real threats he knows about the globalist he
[01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:10.820]  knows about the new world order he is a America not globalism Americanism not
[01:49:10.820 --> 01:49:16.660]  globalism and so they're really really really scared he also knows about the
[01:49:16.660 --> 01:49:20.780]  Clinton cabal he's not afraid of them he's willing to go after them and
[01:49:20.780 --> 01:49:24.620]  understands the country is in crisis and even those can be painful the
[01:49:24.620 --> 01:49:28.020]  corruption must be removed because the corruption is going to destroy the
[01:49:28.020 --> 01:49:31.700]  nation we're finally at that point of saying we need the military we need the
[01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:34.540]  government with the Justice Department to stand up to the globalist to kick
[01:49:34.540 --> 01:49:38.140]  them out to not let foreign countries run us and finally it's happening so
[01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:41.020]  people need to understand doesn't mean Trump's perfect doesn't mean the
[01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:44.940]  Republicans are perfect but they aren't out to destroy the country the
[01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:49.060]  Democrats don't want borders they're globalist we're kicking many icons out
[01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:52.500]  that are also globalist this is an American restoration this is the
[01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:55.780]  retaking of the country and I can't believe he's got the economy doing well
[01:49:55.780 --> 01:49:59.580]  and a bunch of other stuff stabilized while he's doing it I mean usually this
[01:49:59.580 --> 01:50:04.020]  stuff takes you know giant bloody civil wars so Trump is really the master
[01:50:04.020 --> 01:50:08.300]  wizard at this point in my view and I absolutely admire him because to see
[01:50:08.300 --> 01:50:12.180]  someone true and faithful and strong and honorable versus all these traders and
[01:50:12.180 --> 01:50:15.580]  to see America coming back from the dead and nationalism come back from the dead
[01:50:15.580 --> 01:50:19.140]  all the world is really a magic moment he's gonna defend the Second Amendment
[01:50:19.140 --> 01:50:22.660]  he's gonna go after the corruption he's gonna clean it out you want lock her up
[01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:26.380]  we're getting the guy in position that said she should be locked up so that's
[01:50:26.380 --> 01:50:31.980]  my baseball is that this is the president's wartime consigliary what is
[01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:37.500]  your view on that well Alex I think what's disturbing the Democrats so much
[01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:43.460]  is that the new acting Attorney General is an enormously capable attorney he
[01:50:43.460 --> 01:50:47.220]  served as the Chief of Staff of the Justice Department under Attorney
[01:50:47.220 --> 01:50:53.380]  General John Ashcroft he was himself a prosecuting US Attorney in Iowa he also
[01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:58.540]  happens to be a person of faith as someone who has been a conservative
[01:50:58.540 --> 01:51:03.860]  activist which is which he under the law is entitled to and he is opined for
[01:51:03.860 --> 01:51:09.900]  example that Hillary should have been prosecuted for her actions in the the
[01:51:09.900 --> 01:51:14.380]  illegal email he's a right-wing patriot Christian that's pro-American is ready
[01:51:14.380 --> 01:51:18.420]  to stand up for the nation as Darga Seller so so immediately the Democrats
[01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:22.660]  say oh because he has political opinions he should recuse himself well if that
[01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:26.820]  were true then the that many members of the strike force of Robert Mueller should
[01:51:26.820 --> 01:51:32.340]  recuse themselves we know that that Andrew Weissman his top prosecutor
[01:51:32.340 --> 01:51:37.900]  applauded sadly Yates when she refused it to carry out the president's orders on
[01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:43.900]  immigration we know that he attended Hillary Clinton's election Eve
[01:51:43.900 --> 01:51:50.260]  celebration we know of the political contributions from the to the Democrats
[01:51:50.260 --> 01:51:55.140]  and Hillary Clinton from various members of the Mueller strike force so
[01:51:55.140 --> 01:52:00.100]  it's okay for liberal Democrats to have to have a history of political and
[01:52:00.100 --> 01:52:04.820]  partisan activism when they're in the judicial branch but it's not okay for
[01:52:04.820 --> 01:52:10.300]  Republicans this is an absurd argument and what they're afraid of is that up
[01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:15.220]  till now Rod Rosenstein who was a deep-state quisling and a close
[01:52:15.220 --> 01:52:20.900]  associate of both James Comey and Robert Mueller had oversight over the
[01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:25.660]  Mueller investigation now an attorney general who believes in the rule of law
[01:52:25.660 --> 01:52:31.260]  and is not going to brook the kind of abuses we have seen by Mr. Mueller is in
[01:52:31.260 --> 01:52:36.340]  charge of that investigation this is why and this is a very key point Alex the
[01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:41.460]  Democrats in the house are soft peddling in paint impeachment we cannot let them
[01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:45.780]  get away with that oh no we have no intention of peaching Trump we just
[01:52:45.780 --> 01:52:50.780]  want to investigate him well what's the purpose of investigation he cannot be
[01:52:50.780 --> 01:52:55.900]  indicted by a sitting president the Justice Department's of both the Nixon
[01:52:55.900 --> 01:53:00.420]  and the Obama just pardon me the Clinton Justice Department have issued
[01:53:00.420 --> 01:53:06.060]  opinions on that so the only purpose for investigating the president by the
[01:53:06.060 --> 01:53:14.260]  Congress would be for the purposes of impeaching Trump must take the gloves
[01:53:14.260 --> 01:53:18.700]  off they're going on the offense against him they had him hobbled before with a
[01:53:18.700 --> 01:53:22.100]  controlled Justice Department that's not the case now he must go on the offense
[01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:25.220]  or they're gonna be able to take down the relaunch of America Roger Stone thank
[01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:29.500]  you so much for joining us Alex great to be with you all right I want to get to
[01:53:29.500 --> 01:53:34.940]  this for the our ends you're about to see real doctored footage as the
[01:53:34.940 --> 01:53:38.740]  president said earlier today when we zoomed in to show a costa karate chop
[01:53:38.740 --> 01:53:43.060]  in your arm and pulling the mic away and she looked scared and stood back that
[01:53:43.060 --> 01:53:48.220]  was not doctored that was zoomed in to make it clear and closer up the opposite
[01:53:48.220 --> 01:53:51.900]  of deception when you zoom in and the president's pointed that out our exact
[01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:56.260]  words it's the truth now media matters is running a big national campaign to
[01:53:56.260 --> 01:54:01.500]  have I want shroyer taken off Twitter and Facebook now and and and unpersoned
[01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:06.060]  and we can put their headline up on screen and they're saying because we
[01:54:06.060 --> 01:54:10.060]  dehumanized and harassed and spread hate against innocent black American
[01:54:10.060 --> 01:54:14.820]  family who was trying to simply be at the Smithsonian well the full video is
[01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:17.540]  like 20 minutes long it's on him full horse.com will play a shorter clip now
[01:54:17.540 --> 01:54:21.140]  but it's unedited it's just in the context of them coming over to him
[01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:25.060]  he's talking about black unemployment being the best you know ever and now
[01:54:25.060 --> 01:54:27.380]  Trump's reaching out to african-americans how great it is these folks
[01:54:27.380 --> 01:54:31.100]  swowers are bumping him saying get out of here they come over to him they edit
[01:54:31.100 --> 01:54:36.660]  that off the front and then they play a 30-second clip but first see in context
[01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:41.060]  what happened and then the edited clip by media matters here it is Kanye West and
[01:54:41.060 --> 01:54:46.060]  Candace Owens are literally leading a brand new cultural revolution for
[01:54:46.060 --> 01:54:49.820]  african-americans in America right now getting themselves off the democrat
[01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:55.820]  plantation you think I'm crazy ma'am why do you think I'm crazy I love that
[01:54:55.820 --> 01:55:00.900]  they're showing the hate here's the hate now he's coming up to me look at it
[01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:05.980]  oh my gosh what is your deal dude move away from me now you literally came up

[01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:29.060]  are still in the cult but you guys the full articles on infowars.com says
[01:55:29.060 --> 01:55:32.820]  you're still in the cult you'll get off the system the full interview the full
[01:55:32.820 --> 01:55:36.260]  things up there now this is what media matters showed they only showed 30
[01:55:36.260 --> 01:55:40.100]  seconds where it just looks like he's saying you're in the cult because you're
[01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:44.700]  at the Smithsonian for Black History Month that sounds really mean and bad
[01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:48.020]  he still has a right to do it if he wanted to but I'd fire him and no one
[01:55:48.020 --> 01:55:51.260]  would ever do that so here's what they showed they don't show her come over
[01:55:51.260 --> 01:55:54.860]  saying you're crazy not gonna set off him getting his face them initiating a
[01:55:54.860 --> 01:55:59.860]  soul they just show this you guys are still on that you guys are still in the
[01:55:59.860 --> 01:56:05.340]  cult but you guys can get out of the cult this is how cult people behave so
[01:56:05.340 --> 01:56:08.700]  they choose not to be part of the African-American revolution that's
[01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:13.540]  happening right now so that's fine no I understand you don't want to be on film
[01:56:13.540 --> 01:56:16.860]  showing the world how hateful you are but you're too late you already did you
[01:56:16.860 --> 01:56:24.580]  already did fuck but she says wow that's always fun folks it's always fun to
[01:56:24.580 --> 01:56:30.700]  put your Superman cape on and let the left show their hate so they're trying
[01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:34.060]  to have you remove now and saying you're a racist this is real defamation by
[01:56:34.060 --> 01:56:39.700]  George Soros this is real defamation that is pure doctored right there well and
[01:56:39.700 --> 01:56:43.420]  you notice how like you said Alex they make it out that I'm bullying them
[01:56:43.420 --> 01:56:47.140]  like oh my gosh if somebody just saw that video they'd assume okay he just
[01:56:47.140 --> 01:56:51.860]  decided to put these people on camera and say they're in a cult and I guess
[01:56:51.860 --> 01:56:54.700]  assume that they're all in the same family that's also probably racist of
[01:56:54.700 --> 01:56:57.460]  media matters to assume they're all in the same family because they're black I
[01:56:57.460 --> 01:57:00.420]  don't think that's the case so that's kind of racist of them but nonetheless
[01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:04.660]  they don't show the guy literally I mean the guys clearly I mean I don't know I
[01:57:04.660 --> 01:57:07.300]  guess he maybe he's hopped up on drugs I don't know anybody else who behaves like
[01:57:07.300 --> 01:57:11.860]  that comes up gets in my face you know tells me to move screams at me and then
[01:57:11.860 --> 01:57:15.340]  whoever this other lady is comes up and knocks my head off and you know what it
[01:57:15.340 --> 01:57:20.500]  is Alex I'm standing there doing that my report in front of the African American
[01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:24.180]  history and culture museum there at the Smithsonian because like you said I was
[01:57:24.180 --> 01:57:28.900]  talking about the jobs numbers I was talking about Kanye West is and these
[01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:32.740]  people came over to try to stop your free speech and that's now transmuted in
[01:57:32.740 --> 01:57:37.060]  the alchemy of George Soros media matters that you now just came up for no
[01:57:37.060 --> 01:57:40.420]  reason and got in the face of some poor people when they really assaulted you
[01:57:40.420 --> 01:57:45.460]  for no reason that is the definition of inversion they were hateful we'll be

[02:00:28.620 --> 02:00:33.580]  show they want to take you off Twitter as they say you brutalized you dehumanized
[02:00:33.580 --> 02:00:37.940]  I'm just innocent loving family of African-Americans and here comes
[02:00:37.940 --> 02:00:43.100]  meanie Owen and he just starts calling them you know in the cult after they
[02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:46.780]  knock your hat off after they get in your face after he pushes you for no
[02:00:46.780 --> 02:00:50.580]  reason don't know how great it is that blacks unemployment is lowest ever and
[02:00:50.580 --> 02:00:55.500]  how wonderful Kanye West is oh wonderful wonderful love the Smithsonian black
[02:00:55.500 --> 02:01:02.660]  history man you are and then Soros's goons edit that they think man they're
[02:01:02.660 --> 02:01:05.980]  incredible if you imagine if we didn't even have a platform how much worse the
[02:01:05.980 --> 02:01:09.460]  lies would be that they would say that you had murdered that family well thank
[02:01:09.460 --> 02:01:12.460]  you for allowing me your platform to actually get the truth out but alex this
[02:01:12.460 --> 02:01:16.700]  is exactly what they do to you and this is the next level deception beyond just
[02:01:16.700 --> 02:01:20.100]  the editing of the video where they don't show the full video in context and
[02:01:20.100 --> 02:01:24.300]  then they just so you know basically show me responding to them getting
[02:01:24.300 --> 02:01:28.420]  aggressive with me but what are they trying to do now they want to ban the
[02:01:28.420 --> 02:01:33.780]  actual source of the video so that you can't go see the original video and no
[02:01:33.780 --> 02:01:37.340]  that's right that videos on that page with hundreds of thousands of that
[02:01:37.340 --> 02:01:41.620]  exactly yeah so so that's the other target here the target is okay let's
[02:01:41.620 --> 02:01:46.260]  first let's deceptively edit a video and then lie about the individual but then
[02:01:46.260 --> 02:01:50.660]  like D platform the individual and get rid of the actual source of the video to
[02:01:50.660 --> 02:01:54.300]  begin with and so that's that's kind of their little ballgame that they like to
[02:01:54.300 --> 02:01:58.220]  do here but you know Alex the funny thing in it is is that media matters are
[02:01:58.220 --> 02:02:01.740]  the real racists they show it in this article where they assume these people
[02:02:01.740 --> 02:02:05.740]  are all for their run and funded by a literal Nazi collaborator but here's
[02:02:05.740 --> 02:02:09.460]  the thing Alex I don't I don't talk differently because there's a black guy
[02:02:09.460 --> 02:02:12.820]  standing next to me you know I'm saying I don't talk differently because there's
[02:02:12.820 --> 02:02:15.860]  a Mexican guy standing I remember I called you that morning and I said hey
[02:02:15.860 --> 02:02:18.180]  great job at the walk away but I want you to go around town and shoot some
[02:02:18.180 --> 02:02:21.780]  reports and you went around a shot like 10 reports and you know it's the
[02:02:21.780 --> 02:02:25.860]  Smithsonian talk about this and and of course there's gonna be oh it was
[02:02:25.860 --> 02:02:29.420]  cultural appropriation because these people obviously are leftist racist
[02:02:29.420 --> 02:02:33.420]  they've been taught whites are bad by MSNBC and CNN so they think it's so
[02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:37.500]  weird to hear a white guy saying how great Kanye West is and how great black
[02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:41.300]  unemployment is and how proud this revolution is so they can't have that
[02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:46.540]  well I think I should actually I want to thank CNN and MSNBC and ABC and media
[02:02:46.540 --> 02:02:52.140]  matters and CBS and NBC for labeling us as racists and KKK members falsely and
[02:02:52.140 --> 02:02:56.940]  dehumanizing us and engaging in massive defamation of us I want to thank the
[02:02:56.940 --> 02:03:00.580]  fake news out there the enemy of the people that has put a target on our
[02:03:00.580 --> 02:03:05.980]  back on our back for people like this I don't even get free speech you know I
[02:03:05.980 --> 02:03:10.860]  can't walk around and say hey America's doing great we got the jobs numbers up
[02:03:10.860 --> 02:03:14.860]  I'm outside of the African-American history of culture you know and but I'm
[02:03:14.860 --> 02:03:18.540]  just doing a live report no no no you don't get that free speech whitey with
[02:03:18.540 --> 02:03:23.540]  the Trump cap on get out of here cracker and he literally could just move
[02:03:23.540 --> 02:03:28.620]  move and then his friend or bumping nose comes over knocks my head off and I'm
[02:03:28.620 --> 02:03:31.780]  the bad guy Alex but you'll never get to see that video because they will erase
[02:03:31.780 --> 02:03:34.660]  me off Facebook probably by the end of the day we got because that's how it
[02:03:34.660 --> 02:03:39.180]  works because a Nazi collaborator helped round up his fellow Jews he he
[02:03:39.180 --> 02:03:43.180]  overthrows countries he kills people he's a criminal but here it was he
[02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:47.180]  works it's all the news that we doctored Acosta he never touched her he said I
[02:03:47.180 --> 02:03:50.260]  never touched her total lie we did not bring we zoomed in on it as the
[02:03:50.260 --> 02:03:53.900]  president said but there's your real doctoring there's your real doctoring
[02:03:53.900 --> 02:03:58.260]  right there and then the manipulation of reality to go and say you have to remove
[02:03:58.260 --> 02:04:02.140]  that channel off of Facebook so that you can't see the full video they're like
[02:04:02.140 --> 02:04:06.020]  the dehumanization of the innocent black family is the most chilling hate we've
[02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:10.940]  ever seen he makes them literally grovel in fear Troyer a known white
[02:04:10.940 --> 02:04:18.660]  supremacist commando it's all my funny though and a certain level man these
[02:04:18.660 --> 02:04:25.740]  people are such flaming liars did it is like whoa all I say is America's coming
[02:04:25.740 --> 02:04:31.140]  back move bitch get out the way get out the way bitch move out the way you see
[02:04:31.140 --> 02:04:34.500]  them actually wait we need to do the remix with that doing a hundred on the
[02:04:34.500 --> 02:04:41.340]  highway cuz that guy says move move we need to do the box in TV's bitch tell
[02:04:41.340 --> 02:04:47.220]  me that you're getting my I said move whitey move
[02:04:47.220 --> 02:04:52.620]  unbelievable brainwashing in the left it's just so funny man the great thing
[02:04:52.620 --> 02:04:56.860]  is most black folks are breaking up it's beautiful we love them the globalists
[02:04:56.860 --> 02:05:00.540]  know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of
[02:05:00.540 --> 02:05:05.540]  bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that it lowers IQ it
[02:05:05.540 --> 02:05:10.340]  literally dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and
[02:05:10.340 --> 02:05:15.260]  viewers the best idea in the world we've gone through two permutations first
[02:05:15.260 --> 02:05:19.460]  seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalist
[02:05:19.460 --> 02:05:23.300]  tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals a
[02:05:23.300 --> 02:05:28.300]  pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible now due to the
[02:05:28.300 --> 02:05:32.800]  establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the
[02:05:32.800 --> 02:05:37.340]  deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemist scientists and others showed
[02:05:37.340 --> 02:05:41.460]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of
[02:05:41.460 --> 02:05:48.220]  iodine and vitamin C it supercharges it and makes it even more bio available
[02:05:48.220 --> 02:05:51.580]  ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see it it's an
[02:05:51.580 --> 02:05:59.780]  incredible discovery x3 now available at m4slife.com big brother mainstream
[02:05:59.780 --> 02:06:06.940]  media government cover us you want to stop tyranny well so does he live from
[02:06:06.940 --> 02:06:28.780]  the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[02:06:28.780 --> 02:06:34.060]  I'm watching the midterms then you would think our country is mad max
[02:06:34.060 --> 02:06:38.220]  thunder don't this guy is like they're coming from Guatemala they're coming
[02:06:38.220 --> 02:06:40.900]  from Mexico
[02:06:40.900 --> 02:07:04.620]  there's a liberal mob that's coming
[02:07:10.900 --> 02:07:26.780]  and then you would think everybody in the countries is like to the bunker
[02:07:27.340 --> 02:07:33.980]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
[02:07:33.980 --> 02:07:40.780]  lines of the info war well I'm very very thankful they survived 12 others didn't
[02:07:40.780 --> 02:07:48.580]  Alex Chadoff and Ali Chandra Alex Chadoff is a 20 year old college student
[02:07:48.580 --> 02:07:51.620]  he attends California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks California
[02:07:51.620 --> 02:07:56.700]  pursuing a degree in criminal justice his girlfriend Ali Chandra is a 21 year
[02:07:56.700 --> 02:08:00.980]  old college students she attends Pierce College in Chatsworth, California and she

[02:08:04.500 --> 02:08:08.940]  California during the recent a nightmare shooting two nights ago they are strong
[02:08:08.940 --> 02:08:11.900]  advocates for the second amendment and they didn't want to be basically mis
[02:08:11.900 --> 02:08:15.180]  represented just like you saw it Parkland which is a shooting that happened
[02:08:15.180 --> 02:08:18.060]  I didn't say it didn't happen I said out of 3,000 students they picked four
[02:08:18.060 --> 02:08:21.380]  anti-gunners to go out and be the spokesperson for everybody but we're
[02:08:21.380 --> 02:08:25.620]  very glad they survived they join us they're also very close to the death
[02:08:25.620 --> 02:08:29.260]  like inferno and in California is a beautiful state and has a lot of great
[02:08:29.260 --> 02:08:33.260]  people in it but also it's it's got some hellish qualities to it so they can
[02:08:33.260 --> 02:08:37.420]  report on that well they'll also give us their take on X Marine with PTSD
[02:08:37.420 --> 02:08:41.800]  posted on Instagram with a gun in one hand and a phone in the other as he
[02:08:41.800 --> 02:08:46.740]  killed 12 people at a country bar massacre as it's revealed he was bullied
[02:08:46.740 --> 02:08:52.020]  for his lazy eye in high school oh so then you go kill some innocent people
[02:08:52.020 --> 02:08:55.740]  what this guy should have been a mental institution in fact he'd been in one
[02:08:55.740 --> 02:09:00.140]  reportedly this is just horrible ladies and gentlemen but again are they gonna
[02:09:00.140 --> 02:09:04.940]  ban Instagram other things like Facebook because remember oh it was the
[02:09:04.940 --> 02:09:09.140]  fault of gab that the guy four minutes before he went into the Jewish temple and
[02:09:09.140 --> 02:09:13.700]  did that other horrible monster wow this is incredible so Alex and Ali thanks

[02:09:34.220 --> 02:09:37.220]  tendency to run on myself so just whatever it is you want to get out out
[02:09:37.220 --> 02:09:40.060]  front what happened that night why you want to speak about the Second
[02:09:40.060 --> 02:09:45.460]  Amendment I just you got the floor both of you absolutely so what happened was
[02:09:45.460 --> 02:09:52.380]  we go to the bars car called the borderline and what it is there it's
[02:09:52.380 --> 02:09:55.460]  like a country bars people go there to dance people go there to line dance
[02:09:55.460 --> 02:10:00.020]  people go there to two-step and it's just a place me and my girl yeah it's a
[02:10:00.020 --> 02:10:05.740]  place me and my girlfriend go every week on Wednesdays for a polish day and
[02:10:05.740 --> 02:10:12.260]  this Wednesday we got there about nine o'clock and we were having a fine time
[02:10:12.260 --> 02:10:18.940]  we were sitting over on the right side of the building kind of a DJ booth and
[02:10:18.940 --> 02:10:28.380]  at about 11 20 we heard what was sounded like a table being knocked over so we
[02:10:28.380 --> 02:10:32.940]  didn't think anything of it but then it kept happening and it sounded like
[02:10:32.940 --> 02:10:37.820]  balloons are popping except the way louder and they were like this is it's
[02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:43.980]  this is a gun and so what we did was we went behind our DJ booth shots were
[02:10:43.980 --> 02:10:54.980]  ringing out it was it was maybe 20 30 shots and people were screaming and we
[02:10:54.980 --> 02:11:07.300]  were just hiding and then somebody took a one window that was near us so then
[02:11:07.300 --> 02:11:12.660]  we were like okay the gunman knows where we are we have to get out so we what we
[02:11:12.660 --> 02:11:17.660]  did yeah yeah we jumped out the window we jumped out one of the windows which
[02:11:17.660 --> 02:11:21.380]  was pretty high yeah it was a high window somebody there was a guy who jumped out
[02:11:21.380 --> 02:11:25.460]  and he was catching me caught me yeah my friend unfortunately didn't get caught
[02:11:25.460 --> 02:11:31.460]  yeah she got hurt wow but and then she she had to get some stitches she had
[02:11:31.460 --> 02:11:34.580]  everything she was fine just you didn't get caught there's a lot of people getting
[02:11:34.580 --> 02:11:38.580]  thrown off the balcony because there was no other escape because she was at the
[02:11:38.580 --> 02:11:44.580]  front entrance obviously yeah you need to find a way out yeah a guy punched a
[02:11:44.580 --> 02:11:49.580]  window just to get out yeah and yeah so what we did was we jumped out the window
[02:11:49.580 --> 02:11:54.580]  and ran my arm was bleeding just I got cut by it from the the window
[02:11:54.580 --> 02:11:59.540]  so this demon it appeared he came in and was shot the lady at the front shot a
[02:11:59.540 --> 02:12:03.500]  bouncer and then and then it was trying to obviously block the eggs as he could
[02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:15.340]  kill as many as possible yes sir I'm sorry and yeah it was I could imagine
[02:12:15.340 --> 02:12:22.060]  wow a lot and then 12 people killed including this this this mentally ill
[02:12:22.060 --> 02:12:26.660]  monster you know I've said this I think bars and big places I don't think you
[02:12:26.660 --> 02:12:31.460]  can make it a law but I think if people said there's a security fee a dollar per
[02:12:31.460 --> 02:12:35.780]  person or whatever you should have two arm guards at any big big bar or place
[02:12:35.780 --> 02:12:40.780]  just for any problems anyways I've got arm guards here they're only $30 an hour
[02:12:40.780 --> 02:12:43.980]  and then they're like really soldiers and you know people that have been in
[02:12:43.980 --> 02:12:48.660]  Blackwater CIA everything $30 an hour you can get really battle-hardened good
[02:12:48.660 --> 02:12:51.900]  people long track records and they could just be at schools they could be
[02:12:51.900 --> 02:12:56.540]  everywhere and it's not very expensive at $30 an hour people really but but I'm
[02:12:56.540 --> 02:13:02.620]  digressing what do you think should be done about this I feel like he knew it
[02:13:02.620 --> 02:13:05.900]  was a gun freeze out he knew it was targeted someone that we were completely
[02:13:05.900 --> 02:13:10.540]  defenseless he probably knew that the security guards didn't have guns so if he
[02:13:10.540 --> 02:13:16.420]  knew that people were armed in there it would have been a less of a chance of a
[02:13:16.420 --> 02:13:20.340]  shooting happen yeah exactly like we have security guards there but you know
[02:13:20.340 --> 02:13:24.820]  the gun freeze yeah that he could have gone in there and he has the upper hand
[02:13:24.820 --> 02:13:29.420]  exactly I believe that there should have been security that were all even if
[02:13:29.420 --> 02:13:35.780]  people I mean like I I mean one idea that we talked to somebody about was the
[02:13:35.780 --> 02:13:40.540]  idea of like if you have a carry permit if you have the right to carry have a
[02:13:40.540 --> 02:13:45.820]  wristband yeah Kate we talked to Kate Benning yesterday and she she talked
[02:13:45.820 --> 02:13:48.540]  about that with us I thought it was a good idea and the left will go oh but
[02:13:48.540 --> 02:13:51.260]  then you'd shoot people know the people with the concealed carry at the lowest
[02:13:51.260 --> 02:13:55.140]  crime rate I'm a crazy person isn't gonna fall the law
[02:13:55.140 --> 02:14:00.140]  here's exactly that one well look I mean let's pull back and expand on this
[02:14:00.140 --> 02:14:04.380]  because they're blaming the Second Amendment as usual we have people
[02:14:04.380 --> 02:14:08.060]  running over folks with cars stabbing people everywhere people poisoning people
[02:14:08.060 --> 02:14:11.500]  this is a mental illness problem you guys obviously talk to police you've talked
[02:14:11.500 --> 02:14:14.900]  to other survivors they're saying you did it because he had a lazy eye people
[02:14:14.900 --> 02:14:19.260]  were mean to him in high school who knows if that's even true because I don't
[02:14:19.260 --> 02:14:22.500]  really believe much comes out of the Daily Mail quite friendly because they've
[02:14:22.500 --> 02:14:27.300]  lied about me do you guys have any ideas was this guy like an involuntarily

[02:20:21.380 --> 02:20:26.300]  we have a fascinating guest I mean fascinating I'm not even gonna do it
[02:20:26.300 --> 02:20:32.380]  is coming up next segment but I have three daughters I have a son and I
[02:20:32.380 --> 02:20:35.700]  really worry about my son but there's this genetic thing with men like your
[02:20:35.700 --> 02:20:43.500]  son you just can't help but not I treat him great but he just he's 16 now and I
[02:20:43.500 --> 02:20:50.180]  care about him but you're tough on my daughters I could not ever imagine some
[02:20:50.180 --> 02:20:53.980]  demon piece of crap killing them and most these guys are in cells like
[02:20:53.980 --> 02:20:58.620]  everyone so far has been on serotonin rape taking inhibitors some of them have
[02:20:58.620 --> 02:21:02.140]  been in the military most of them are like you know black trench codes are
[02:21:02.140 --> 02:21:05.260]  ending they're like communists they're nazis whatever's dirty they're into it
[02:21:05.260 --> 02:21:09.140]  and then they're mad at girls that were mean to them now we already went to a
[02:21:09.140 --> 02:21:11.900]  psychiatrist right before went on psychotropic it's always the same
[02:21:11.900 --> 02:21:18.140]  there's articles shrimp commit suicide from prozac runoff put it on screen I'm
[02:21:18.140 --> 02:21:21.980]  not kidding fox news there's so much prozac runoff in the water that fish
[02:21:21.980 --> 02:21:26.780]  aren't scared anymore and swim up to birds and are more aggressive and we'll
[02:21:26.780 --> 02:21:29.780]  just start like we're like a foot-long fish will start attacking a pelican
[02:21:29.780 --> 02:21:36.060]  there to shrimp on prozac commit suicide it gets rid of their inhibition and it
[02:21:36.060 --> 02:21:42.140]  says on the serotonin rip reuptake inhibitor packaging may make you commit
[02:21:42.140 --> 02:21:46.100]  suicide may make you go psychotic and engage in mass murder it actually says
[02:21:46.100 --> 02:21:52.780]  may make you murder people and of course two days after he's on psychotropic
[02:21:52.780 --> 02:21:56.700]  he's had a psychiatrist they took a mentally ill person the military is not
[02:21:56.700 --> 02:22:01.500]  perfect and I really think if somebody has these tendencies they've got tests
[02:22:01.500 --> 02:22:05.460]  folks they know they shouldn't have got this guy in he got out of boot camp he
[02:22:05.460 --> 02:22:10.060]  melted down a psychiatrist put him on drugs game over that's my view we have
[02:22:10.060 --> 02:22:15.780]  two survivors Alex Chadoff and Ali Shandra who were there in the time we've
[02:22:15.780 --> 02:22:18.700]  got left and as things develop I'd like to invite you back on here or some of
[02:22:18.700 --> 02:22:21.980]  the other broadcast second amendment what we know about this guy at the
[02:22:21.980 --> 02:22:26.300]  background what else you want to impart to the audience other than thank God
[02:22:26.300 --> 02:22:34.380]  you're alive and as survivors what you'd like the world to know I mean I feel
[02:22:34.380 --> 02:22:38.340]  like this could have been very preventable I I mean we talked a little
[02:22:38.340 --> 02:22:43.660]  bit about this for the break but like literally one person just by the door
[02:22:43.660 --> 02:22:48.300]  or had that had a gun on them could have stopped this immediately because I mean
[02:22:48.300 --> 02:22:53.540]  like it took six minutes for the sheriff to arrive and in those six minutes a
[02:22:53.540 --> 02:22:59.260]  lot can happen and I feel like it just this could be totally preventable that's
[02:22:59.260 --> 02:23:04.300]  why it makes me so angry and even if it wasn't a security guard like somebody
[02:23:04.300 --> 02:23:13.820]  was you know just like it was a gun for your own and it was just unsafe Ali I
[02:23:13.820 --> 02:23:17.060]  saw you seconding what what your boyfriend Alex was saying I mean it's
[02:23:17.060 --> 02:23:22.500]  always like the Pulse nightclub guy that all these people us you know the
[02:23:22.500 --> 02:23:28.420]  psycho who was protected over and over again in Florida at Parkland they had
[02:23:28.420 --> 02:23:31.540]  this leftist program where he'd been convicted of all these different crimes
[02:23:31.540 --> 02:23:34.860]  they just let him go and he was making death threats he was known as the
[02:23:34.860 --> 02:23:38.580]  school shooter and then he was still allowed to do it and then the police
[02:23:38.580 --> 02:23:42.540]  stood down I mean it's pretty obvious they target gun-free zones
[02:23:42.540 --> 02:24:02.340]  when I go to a big movie theater now on a Friday night or something with my
[02:24:02.340 --> 02:24:05.100]  family I feel good when I see a couple cops in there and I know they're getting
[02:24:05.100 --> 02:24:07.820]  paid $30 an hour and that's great they're great people they're trained
[02:24:07.820 --> 02:24:12.860]  a professional 99% of the time they take action when there's a shooter but but
[02:24:12.860 --> 02:24:16.340]  the left and people scared of concealed carries you never see concealed carry
[02:24:16.340 --> 02:24:21.740]  people going and doing a mass murder just by very logic they go follow the law
[02:24:21.740 --> 02:24:25.020]  they go take the test they want to protect themselves criminals and nuts
[02:24:25.020 --> 02:24:32.780]  aren't gonna go do that exactly people are scared and think gun kill people
[02:24:32.780 --> 02:24:37.900]  people kill people I know crazy people people that you like the shooter we're
[02:24:37.900 --> 02:24:41.580]  out of their minds well do you ever see my peers Morgan where I said don't ban
[02:24:41.580 --> 02:24:47.380]  guns ban suicide mass murder pills yeah exactly agree we're gonna tag part of
[02:24:47.380 --> 02:24:51.220]  that interview on the end of this interview when we upload it 104s.com
[02:24:51.220 --> 02:24:53.860]  we can't do it on YouTube and where else is where you know we're evil we're
[02:24:53.860 --> 02:24:58.820]  banned but you know just talking to you makes me more upset though because like
[02:24:58.820 --> 02:25:02.980]  I said I don't know if you have sisters Alex but it's just this thing obviously
[02:25:02.980 --> 02:25:06.660]  for you know brothers and fathers and things about about their girlfriends
[02:25:06.660 --> 02:25:10.940]  their mothers their sisters I mean it's just just that there's these type of
[02:25:10.940 --> 02:25:15.820]  people one thing that men will kill men for no reason that's bad but men that
[02:25:15.820 --> 02:25:19.180]  kill women like even the worst gangster didn't used to kill women but
[02:25:19.180 --> 02:25:23.540]  suddenly all the world from Islam to it's just free free reign to kill women
[02:25:23.540 --> 02:25:29.980]  what the hell happened to me exactly I don't know because I mean like most
[02:25:29.980 --> 02:25:36.020]  shooters are men which I think is interesting but I'm not sure I don't
[02:25:36.020 --> 02:25:40.740]  know what the I don't know what possible well he's got a you have you heard of the
[02:25:40.740 --> 02:25:45.700]  involuntarily celibate movement and all everyone so far this guy's the latest we
[02:25:45.700 --> 02:25:48.100]  don't know yet with him but now psychiatrist drugs we you know that
[02:25:48.100 --> 02:25:52.260]  parking cover everyone I was mad that that girls wouldn't go out with them
[02:25:52.260 --> 02:25:56.200]  because they were creepy or whatever and and it's not the girls fault these
[02:25:56.200 --> 02:26:00.460]  dudes are creepy I mean they're probably mentally ill from from you know
[02:26:00.460 --> 02:26:03.660]  genetically from or from the chemicals that they're all like out of a form of
[02:26:03.660 --> 02:26:11.020]  autism is what I'm saying yeah I mean like I don't know if this guy was so
[02:26:11.020 --> 02:26:16.020]  with that matter specifically but it doesn't make sense it's I mean like I
[02:26:16.020 --> 02:26:19.020]  know there's things coming out that said that he was bullied and everything like
[02:26:19.020 --> 02:26:25.020]  that but I'm not sure if that's why he did it or if it was literally to do
[02:26:25.020 --> 02:26:28.180]  something well let's think about this millions of people die here in cars
[02:26:28.180 --> 02:26:32.900]  hundreds of thousands in the US either die or get seriously injured we don't
[02:26:32.900 --> 02:26:37.460]  say oh take cars away even though it's a deadly weapon it's that it's that there's
[02:26:37.460 --> 02:26:41.460]  a certain profile of a certain scumbag and I'm not trying to be mean to white
[02:26:41.460 --> 02:26:45.100]  people but when profile fits they're mainly white males who are wearing black
[02:26:45.100 --> 02:26:48.540]  trench coats that women have refused because they're creepy and they go do
[02:26:48.540 --> 02:26:53.940]  this for I guess that they want to commit suicide and go out with a bang
[02:26:53.940 --> 02:26:59.820]  and I don't know the mindset that don't understand the mindset of somebody
[02:26:59.820 --> 02:27:12.660]  that can do that especially to just kids it was 18 that's one thing it's a
[02:27:12.660 --> 02:27:16.140]  selfish it's like the fairy tale where you know sleeping beauty the witch isn't
[02:27:16.140 --> 02:27:20.060]  invited to the party so she you know puts the princess into a trance I mean
[02:27:20.060 --> 02:27:24.380]  it's it's these people it's just scary well I appreciate you both I'm glad
[02:27:24.380 --> 02:27:28.420]  you're you know you're both alive obviously did you lose any friends or
[02:27:28.420 --> 02:27:37.740]  any friends with wounded yeah people that we know that's the bar but um yeah we
[02:27:37.740 --> 02:27:41.820]  love stepping maybe too well if the bar reopens I hope they have like an extra
[02:27:41.820 --> 02:27:45.180]  dollar cover charge and put some armed armed bodyguards and I mean that's it's
[02:27:45.180 --> 02:27:48.020]  real simple you got a place with this pretty big place we're like 500 a
[02:27:48.020 --> 02:27:52.940]  thousand people come you better have some armed people there dude yeah it's
[02:27:52.940 --> 02:28:00.500]  actually yeah it's not a big yeah it's not as big as you think it's a large
[02:28:00.500 --> 02:28:03.740]  group yeah like there was a lot of people there there was maybe yeah if you
[02:28:03.740 --> 02:28:07.020]  charge these each person extra dollar cover charge you could easily with no
[02:28:07.020 --> 02:28:11.700]  cost of the place or no loss have to arm back to any police there yeah no it's
[02:28:11.700 --> 02:28:16.900]  like five dollars to get in on these nights yeah yeah well they drop the
[02:28:16.900 --> 02:28:19.980]  ball there because you want cops there anyways because that way there's any
[02:28:19.980 --> 02:28:24.140]  problems with bouncers and stuff it all gets cleared up very stupid any venue of
[02:28:24.140 --> 02:28:27.940]  that size or bigger must have off any police that it's just it's a no-brainer
[02:28:27.940 --> 02:28:31.340]  that whether it's a police incident that you know the police are the cops
[02:28:31.340 --> 02:28:34.220]  that are there just an absolute no-brainer I'm glad you guys are alive
[02:28:34.220 --> 02:28:37.860]  obviously God bless you thanks for coming on and talking about the second

[02:33:43.380 --> 02:33:49.460]  and the fires just get worse and worse the fires get more insane you know one
[02:33:49.460 --> 02:33:54.060]  way Hollywood gets you to sell out is you don't know you're selling out and so
[02:33:54.060 --> 02:33:59.940]  I was in a few movies live and trying to be in them and then they wanted me to do
[02:33:59.940 --> 02:34:04.940]  all these TV shows and then they wanted me to engage on this activity but then
[02:34:04.940 --> 02:34:08.100]  it got down to the wire and it was like no you're gonna have your own TV show
[02:34:08.100 --> 02:34:15.260]  since you turned down the big national radio show which I did it anyways but
[02:34:15.260 --> 02:34:17.900]  you're not gonna talk about the new world order anymore and we're gonna tell you
[02:34:17.900 --> 02:34:24.020]  what to say and I'm sitting there with butlers outdoors at a big estate in the
[02:34:24.020 --> 02:34:28.900]  in the middle of the Hollywood Hills famous estate with with top Hollywood
[02:34:28.900 --> 02:34:32.940]  producers and lawyers like the top of Hollywood Steven Spielberg wasn't there
[02:34:32.940 --> 02:34:37.660]  but that was about it and there's ashes raining down on me and I've been there
[02:34:37.660 --> 02:34:40.220]  about a year before of the same crap was happening and I'm looking out over the
[02:34:40.220 --> 02:34:44.820]  hills and about two miles away there's giant fires and ashes are falling in my
[02:34:44.820 --> 02:34:49.020]  food and I made a decision right there I said this is a waste of time I'm not
[02:34:49.020 --> 02:34:52.260]  gonna do what they want anyways now they've been clear I'm never coming back
[02:34:52.260 --> 02:34:56.940]  here and I've been back once to be on Joe Rogan show and then once I went to
[02:34:56.940 --> 02:35:00.740]  Southern California to do a speech and I drove up to LA and about two years ago
[02:35:00.740 --> 02:35:05.900]  and regretted that as well I turned into a fiasco but it's it's like hell on
[02:35:05.900 --> 02:35:09.820]  earth ladies and gentlemen and that's what wants to run America and run the
[02:35:09.820 --> 02:35:14.100]  world and the whole thing is collapsing into the rest of the US and we accept
[02:35:14.100 --> 02:35:17.780]  the poison when it gets serious I'm gonna put t-shirts out that say don't
[02:35:17.780 --> 02:35:22.780]  California my taxes or don't California my America because it's got to be done
[02:35:22.780 --> 02:35:25.860]  a lot of Californians are great people but the ones leaving seem to be the
[02:35:25.860 --> 02:35:29.780]  worst so I'm gonna stop right there just briefly because we won't be here if we
[02:35:29.780 --> 02:35:35.100]  don't plug we had the biggest sale we've ever had because they're trying to take
[02:35:35.100 --> 02:35:39.740]  our payment processors and shut us down as you see on the news they took five of
[02:35:39.740 --> 02:35:43.780]  our six process we were down to one I got some backups and got contracts now
[02:35:43.780 --> 02:35:50.020]  but you never know and the harassment is just intensifying by Soros it's in the
[02:35:50.020 --> 02:35:55.420]  news and we just covered last hour so I needed to sell out all the Christmas
[02:35:55.420 --> 02:36:01.840]  stock the black Friday stock three sales stock I wanted to sell it out and the
[02:36:01.840 --> 02:36:06.940]  sale was so good we sold a lot of stock then I said we'll get rid of the sale
[02:36:06.940 --> 02:36:12.180]  the sale and I mean sales went to where you know we will not be here in six
[02:36:12.180 --> 02:36:16.380]  months a year at the current sales rate so it's a cash 22 I sold a ton of stock
[02:36:16.380 --> 02:36:20.220]  but didn't make a ton of money off of it to find the operation and to try to
[02:36:20.220 --> 02:36:25.180]  expand you're not expanding your contracting so when I talk about this
[02:36:25.180 --> 02:36:29.180]  folks who's under attack like us Trump and that's it and it's because this
[02:36:29.180 --> 02:36:35.420]  audience and this is the show built the launch pad and launched the new
[02:36:35.420 --> 02:36:41.220]  Renaissance the 1776 option and it was all because I believed in the people and
[02:36:41.220 --> 02:36:45.660]  I believed that if you're gonna have this worldwide tyranny based on austerity
[02:36:45.660 --> 02:36:49.620]  and based on the end of the family and the end of the human-based systems that
[02:36:49.620 --> 02:36:55.540]  if we promoted the greatest expression of human will and goodness the
[02:36:55.540 --> 02:37:01.180]  Renaissance and if we relaunch that people would choose that over the
[02:37:01.180 --> 02:37:05.660]  tyranny of the New World Order was not a really hard equation but we worked hard
[02:37:05.660 --> 02:37:10.940]  we did it we got probably eight nine billion views you know total on YouTube
[02:37:10.940 --> 02:37:14.780]  billions on Facebook we you know hundreds of radio stations across the
[02:37:14.780 --> 02:37:19.400]  country UKIP helped get launched and it's modern formed by us the head of
[02:37:19.400 --> 02:37:22.900]  UKIP said that the founder said no we would literally half our base is you
[02:37:22.900 --> 02:37:27.420]  thank you it's not bragging it's saying we were the right people the right time
[02:37:27.420 --> 02:37:31.140]  when the internet developed and the enemy was arrogant to tell what was
[02:37:31.140 --> 02:37:34.220]  happening so now globalism new world order one real government that's a
[02:37:34.220 --> 02:37:37.860]  household word people know what's happening and all the world natural for
[02:37:37.860 --> 02:37:42.660]  winning but now we're slated for destruction because you and I all of
[02:37:42.660 --> 02:37:47.060]  us together the enforced family you relaunched what's happening now this is
[02:37:47.060 --> 02:37:53.500]  this is epic but now we're slated for destruction and that's why if a larger
[02:37:53.500 --> 02:37:56.260]  portion of the audience would just go get some t-shirts or get some great
[02:37:56.260 --> 02:37:59.300]  supplements they're already amazing they're already great I can't discount
[02:37:59.300 --> 02:38:02.060]  everything because a bunch of stuff's almost sold out a bunch of stuff that
[02:38:02.060 --> 02:38:07.340]  did come in that we have enough of I can give you 67% off the silver bullet I
[02:38:07.340 --> 02:38:12.660]  make like $3 on that at the the x3 is way better next to it's all three types
[02:38:12.660 --> 02:38:16.780]  of iodized the next level 50% off free shipping I make like $10 on that I need
[02:38:16.780 --> 02:38:20.860]  to have funding 57% off supermails for feel about tally that's so expensive to
[02:38:20.860 --> 02:38:24.140]  make as it's cold press and it really works well for libido stamina energy I
[02:38:24.140 --> 02:38:27.420]  just can't deal with it though so I can go with a pill form it's three times
[02:38:27.420 --> 02:38:30.660]  stronger but it's not cold press but it has the same effect cost me less that's
[02:38:30.660 --> 02:38:34.740]  what's more have for you I have to operate I have to fund things I don't
[02:38:34.740 --> 02:38:38.140]  think it's lowering of quality it's just that it's so esoteric and weird to do
[02:38:38.140 --> 02:38:42.020]  that I'm just done with it people love it and it works great this is the end of
[02:38:42.020 --> 02:38:47.300]  that it's 57% off I've got to get it out of here so I've got six months of
[02:38:47.300 --> 02:38:51.500]  funding in case they shut me down they got CNN trucks driving around and we
[02:38:51.500 --> 02:38:55.740]  went and found out who you know obviously we got the plates checked and I
[02:38:55.740 --> 02:38:58.940]  don't know what they're planning but it ain't good okay when I leave here there
[02:38:58.940 --> 02:39:01.540]  will be two chase cars following me I don't know what the hell's going on
[02:39:01.540 --> 02:39:06.380]  sometimes helicopters so the point is is that we need to get funds in right now
[02:39:06.380 --> 02:39:09.620]  these are great products you need them get a t-shirt get a book get a water
[02:39:09.620 --> 02:39:14.340]  filter Alexa pure is the best deal ever info or store.com okay I could have our
[02:39:14.340 --> 02:39:18.180]  next guest on for ten hours and we'll do three minutes here ten minutes and then
[02:39:18.180 --> 02:39:21.180]  five minutes the next hour and then Nick Baggis is taking over and I'm not
[02:39:21.180 --> 02:39:24.020]  going to cut into his time but I just want to introduce this guy to people
[02:39:24.020 --> 02:39:29.700]  because I hardly ever look at YouTube anymore but I wanted to go see if one of
[02:39:29.700 --> 02:39:32.260]  the videos I had done was on there so we can link to that and drive up the
[02:39:32.260 --> 02:39:35.660]  algorithm and you know you know try to get it out to people and so I was
[02:39:35.660 --> 02:39:41.300]  searching my gay frog satire video and I and it just popped up in my feed the
[02:39:41.300 --> 02:39:45.740]  blackpilled this blackpilled.com it popped up so I watched like five of
[02:39:45.740 --> 02:39:51.540]  the videos and I ended up airing some of them last Saturday and the guy is away
[02:39:51.540 --> 02:39:55.380]  with words the way he laid things out the way that by the end of the video I
[02:39:55.380 --> 02:39:59.140]  knew where he was going to be going and it was that you know real experience
[02:39:59.140 --> 02:40:05.580]  where like reading C.S. Lewis or something or just a good writer where you
[02:40:05.580 --> 02:40:08.100]  don't always talk about it first by the middle you get a good idea by the end
[02:40:08.100 --> 02:40:11.980]  you're totally synced with his thinking it's not just your sink it's because he
[02:40:11.980 --> 02:40:15.540]  syncs with the truth and you recognize it by the end and so I don't know where
[02:40:15.540 --> 02:40:18.380]  to start with him I want to introduce him to the audience I want to get him on
[02:40:18.380 --> 02:40:21.980]  as a routine guest I just want to get his take we haven't talked before he came
[02:40:21.980 --> 02:40:25.860]  on about where he sees the world right now and almost didn't even want to get
[02:40:25.860 --> 02:40:28.020]  him on because you know it gives somebody extra attention he's already very
[02:40:28.020 --> 02:40:33.380]  popular 50, 60, 100 million views I don't know 150,000 subscribers on YouTube
[02:40:33.380 --> 02:40:36.540]  but it doesn't matter we can't be shrieking violence we got to give
[02:40:36.540 --> 02:40:40.100]  attention to what is really good like Tucker Carlson I see as being very
[02:40:40.100 --> 02:40:45.260]  strong very pure very clean very truthful very special and I think that
[02:40:45.260 --> 02:40:51.900]  blackpill.com is as well and so joining us is Devon Stack. Devon, great job with

[02:41:02.460 --> 02:41:08.300]  start over it's Devon Stack joining us so I saw your stuff this weekend I
[02:41:08.300 --> 02:41:12.140]  know you've been around for years but really impressive stuff. Oh thanks
[02:41:12.140 --> 02:41:19.460]  thanks yeah I've been doing videos since before the election I was really
[02:41:19.460 --> 02:41:22.700]  trying to make sure Hillary didn't get into office like a lot of people I think
[02:41:22.700 --> 02:41:28.900]  on the right and you know we succeeded at that and now I'm trying to go further
[02:41:28.900 --> 02:41:34.900]  and kind of really analyze the I think the average person doesn't have a good
[02:41:34.900 --> 02:41:39.540]  window into the minds of a lot of these sociopaths that are in the ruling class
[02:41:39.540 --> 02:41:46.020]  because they I mean the average person is not a sociopath and a lot of people
[02:41:46.020 --> 02:41:51.740]  also have a hard time spotting the the propaganda that kind of permeates and
[02:41:51.740 --> 02:41:58.420]  saturates all the stuff coming out of Hollywood and well in even places you
[02:41:58.420 --> 02:42:03.860]  wouldn't expect you know in advertisements even and so I like to try
[02:42:03.860 --> 02:42:08.580]  to dissect you know whether it's movies and you know films that go back I did a
[02:42:08.580 --> 02:42:13.100]  video recently where they were promoting divorce in the 1960s so a lot of
[02:42:13.100 --> 02:42:19.020]  people don't realize how far back this goes so just trying to do my part and
[02:42:19.020 --> 02:42:23.740]  trying to preserve Western civilization I feel like in a lot of ways we're on the
[02:42:23.740 --> 02:42:28.980]  last legs and if we don't get this we don't wake people up and get this
[02:42:28.980 --> 02:42:36.180]  fixed soon you know there's not going to be anything left to preserve so but I

[02:47:07.740 --> 02:47:25.860]  why from the info wars dot-com studios you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:47:25.860 --> 02:47:41.460]  you and on and bit connect that was one of the videos he did I watched last
[02:47:41.460 --> 02:47:46.300]  Saturday it's black pill dot-com the site is down to the massive traffic which
[02:47:46.300 --> 02:47:51.180]  is why I say we should put up the YouTube channel black pill so people can
[02:47:51.180 --> 02:47:57.020]  find that going back here to Devin stack of black pill calm Devin you're a
[02:47:57.020 --> 02:48:01.260]  humble guy but your videos are all out of the park not just the cinematography
[02:48:01.260 --> 02:48:06.180]  not just the way you do the graphics what you say is just I watched now
[02:48:06.180 --> 02:48:09.740]  probably 10 of the videos and I couldn't find any fault and you were able to do
[02:48:09.740 --> 02:48:14.780]  things subtly that I kind of do with like a bull in a china shop so let's
[02:48:14.780 --> 02:48:19.620]  start with QAnon and bit connect because I'm not gonna get into inside baseball
[02:48:19.620 --> 02:48:25.140]  but I've been offered a million dollars a month five hundred thousand dollars a
[02:48:25.140 --> 02:48:28.420]  month you name it which would actually fund us and help us and fix the
[02:48:28.420 --> 02:48:32.580]  problem we have but it was always I thought a pump and dump for different
[02:48:32.580 --> 02:48:35.340]  companies in different groups and obviously I was approached by bit
[02:48:35.340 --> 02:48:38.460]  connect people and I just said listen I've never gotten involved with max
[02:48:38.460 --> 02:48:43.060]  keiser gave me a bunch of Bitcoin I believe in cryptocurrency I know it's
[02:48:43.060 --> 02:48:46.140]  the future I know the Federal Reserve is already its own fake currency so I
[02:48:46.140 --> 02:48:49.500]  don't have a digital thing we all agree on I get tally sticks and you know
[02:48:49.500 --> 02:48:52.620]  800 years ago in the history of money and all the rest of it and the private
[02:48:52.620 --> 02:48:56.620]  Federal Reserve but then when it's like it's this secret bot that's loving and
[02:48:56.620 --> 02:49:00.180]  just keep your money in here I was like Ponzi scheme I'm not doing it people are
[02:49:00.180 --> 02:49:04.860]  like listen just take the money so I don't talk to any of these people I don't
[02:49:04.860 --> 02:49:07.940]  do it some of the networks I've been on have taken some of these ads and I said
[02:49:07.940 --> 02:49:12.900]  I'm leaving if you do that because I just I'll tell people buy great vitamins or
[02:49:12.900 --> 02:49:16.220]  minerals or water filters I know they work damn well and it funds our operation
[02:49:16.220 --> 02:49:23.380]  I'm using them but I can't walk somebody into something that I'm not sure I give
[02:49:23.380 --> 02:49:28.540]  to my kids I just met if it's like Tony Montana says no women no kids I kill
[02:49:28.540 --> 02:49:33.740]  them kill them but no no women no kids it's like I've got rules here and other
[02:49:33.740 --> 02:49:37.500]  people don't you lay it out so beautifully in that video so because I'll
[02:49:37.500 --> 02:49:40.660]  take over as you know you've got the floor talk about that talk about queuing
[02:49:40.660 --> 02:49:44.220]  on because you just put that last video out a few weeks ago I saw man the
[02:49:44.220 --> 02:49:48.060]  sessions thing does that not put the cherry on top of what you said and then
[02:49:48.060 --> 02:49:53.260]  QAnon saying I'm gonna be arrested I'm this evil person I mean that is I can
[02:49:53.260 --> 02:49:56.700]  tell you that's pure horsemen are obviously so you really did the best
[02:49:56.700 --> 02:50:01.500]  job I thought subtly with QAnon by exposing bit connected just saying oh
[02:50:01.500 --> 02:50:08.620]  I'm gonna now cover QAnon but I guess I just did yeah well I think that my the
[02:50:08.620 --> 02:50:13.020]  biggest concern I had when QAnon first popped up on the scene I noticed a lot
[02:50:13.020 --> 02:50:18.140]  of people talking about him and it wasn't so much that I disagreed with
[02:50:18.140 --> 02:50:23.980]  everything QAnon was saying my fear was just like with bit connected so bit
[02:50:23.980 --> 02:50:28.780]  connected as you described that it was basically a Ponzi scheme and when a lot
[02:50:28.780 --> 02:50:33.060]  of people invested their money into bit connect and then it ended up like every
[02:50:33.060 --> 02:50:38.460]  Ponzi scheme but eventually failed it turned a lot of people off to cryptocurrency
[02:50:38.460 --> 02:50:42.700]  just in general so it was just a it was really the only people that ended up
[02:50:42.700 --> 02:50:46.820]  benefiting were the you know the people the top of the pyramid scheme and it
[02:50:46.820 --> 02:50:50.500]  really hurt the market and of course it imploded right around the same time the
[02:50:50.500 --> 02:50:56.580]  whole market bubble popped and it was a huge mess and so my fear was that we were
[02:50:56.580 --> 02:51:01.140]  gonna basically see the same kind of a thing with QAnon where people were going
[02:51:01.140 --> 02:51:07.700]  to put their hopes and dreams into this anonymous poster and then if if it if a
[02:51:07.700 --> 02:51:11.220]  day ever came like what I don't know like the other day when sessions got
[02:51:11.220 --> 02:51:17.580]  fired where it became pretty obvious that this was all a hoax then they would
[02:51:17.580 --> 02:51:22.420]  all the sudden disregard everything all the research they may have done they
[02:51:22.420 --> 02:51:26.940]  might think oh well if that's if this was a lie then it's all lie I'm gonna go
[02:51:26.940 --> 02:51:32.740]  right back to watching CNN and MSNBC and it was gonna actually do more damage
[02:51:32.740 --> 02:51:38.060]  than good I think whoever came up with it there maybe I don't know their initial
[02:51:38.060 --> 02:51:42.260]  intentions might have been good I know let's try to get people well and yeah
[02:51:42.260 --> 02:51:45.540]  there's that microchip guy and I don't know a hundred percent who's running it
[02:51:45.540 --> 02:51:51.460]  now but it's like it's it's kind of like it's doing more damage than good now and
[02:51:51.460 --> 02:51:55.980]  it just seemed it seemed like enough was enough and so I had to make that
[02:51:55.980 --> 02:51:59.780]  metaphor like or use the parable really of you know here's what happened with
[02:51:59.780 --> 02:52:06.060]  bit connect and this is what's gonna happen when when QAnon collapses and
[02:52:06.060 --> 02:52:09.620]  honestly I've seen a lot of that already I've seen people who are losing
[02:52:09.620 --> 02:52:14.580]  hope who are become you know despite my name I'm not completely black pilled
[02:52:14.580 --> 02:52:18.220]  about the future but there are people that are really black pilled now because
[02:52:18.220 --> 02:52:23.180]  of the their experience with QAnon yeah where's you get the term black pill
[02:52:23.180 --> 02:52:27.580]  what's that mean so black pill it means different things different people but
[02:52:27.580 --> 02:52:32.220]  pretty much it means like red pill a little bit of this way black pill does
[02:52:32.220 --> 02:52:35.620]  like you've had too many red pills where it just it seems like it's a little
[02:52:35.620 --> 02:52:42.420]  overwhelming it's a little too much and yeah I've been black pilled right but
[02:52:42.420 --> 02:52:47.700]  well yeah and and honestly it you know I'm not black pilled in terms of there's
[02:52:47.700 --> 02:52:52.740]  no possible way for a future for me and my children but I'm definitely black
[02:52:52.740 --> 02:52:58.860]  pilled in terms of I don't see America ever really at least not on its current
[02:52:58.860 --> 02:53:04.740]  track I totally agree unless people break with a psychic political virus that the
[02:53:04.740 --> 02:53:08.980]  globalist and WikiLeaks admits is meant to bring us down destroy us and steal
[02:53:08.980 --> 02:53:12.220]  our prosperity because the globalist don't want the general public demanding
[02:53:12.220 --> 02:53:16.260]  prosperity which we could have into a thousand star systems immediately they
[02:53:16.260 --> 02:53:20.700]  want to psychically and politically poisonize so we roll over and die so I
[02:53:20.700 --> 02:53:24.820]  agree unless people come it's so obvious when you know this that you're right
[02:53:24.820 --> 02:53:29.940]  it's a very bleak future and you just didn't Trump like this flamethrower of
[02:53:29.940 --> 02:53:33.340]  truth once you know all this stuff you know what he's doing it's like God
[02:53:33.340 --> 02:53:39.420]  they're not taking their life boats it's like so obvious sorry I'm ranting no I
[02:53:39.420 --> 02:53:44.900]  you're right it's the problem is there's really what we need is we need to
[02:53:44.900 --> 02:53:47.980]  have something that brings everyone together the problem with the right
[02:53:47.980 --> 02:53:53.020]  right now is we're in there's some benefits to this rather than the left
[02:53:53.020 --> 02:53:56.700]  is creating division so we have to use division to counter because that's how
[02:53:56.700 --> 02:53:59.660]  the primitive programming works and Trump that wants to get out of that
[02:53:59.660 --> 02:54:03.500]  process he said that but what is he supposed to do when people are so dumb
[02:54:03.500 --> 02:54:07.060]  using primitive programming on people he goes yes we're all together but they're
[02:54:07.060 --> 02:54:11.420]  being racist so primitive come together what is he supposed to do well I just
[02:54:11.420 --> 02:54:17.900]  think I think the right in general needs to to focus maybe somewhat on on in real
[02:54:17.900 --> 02:54:23.580]  life activism I agree the problem is the left wing needs to engage in a third
[02:54:23.580 --> 02:54:28.460]  dimension invasion well and we need we need honestly we need funding a lot of
[02:54:28.460 --> 02:54:32.660]  it's tough because they've got George Soros and and quite frankly the right
[02:54:32.660 --> 02:54:36.220]  threatens billionaires so what billionaire is gonna want to fund a
[02:54:36.220 --> 02:54:40.140]  movement because he feels like he's part of the establishment even though he will
[02:54:40.140 --> 02:54:44.740]  be destroyed by the system he wants 15 Ferraris instead of stepping into the
[02:54:44.740 --> 02:54:49.660]  game he got there by playing it safe so he's going to go oh yeah I'm glad Alex
[02:54:49.660 --> 02:54:54.060]  Jones or black pills there but they're not really committed yeah there's not
[02:54:54.060 --> 02:54:57.500]  enough there's not enough people on the right that I mean there's obviously the
[02:54:57.500 --> 02:55:03.300]  usual suspects that are gonna fund the neocon type stuff but there's no one on
[02:55:03.300 --> 02:55:09.980]  the right that really wants to have any kind of a libertarian style America that
[02:55:09.980 --> 02:55:14.980]  that's funding us that's not it very controlled you know and that's the thing
[02:55:14.980 --> 02:55:19.940]  too is once you accept the money now all the sudden you have to accept whatever
[02:55:19.940 --> 02:55:24.980]  platform there's no one that's that's willing to just fund organizations and
[02:55:24.980 --> 02:55:30.860]  and and help us exist so it's really it's tough it's tough as a youtuber you
[02:55:30.860 --> 02:55:34.100]  know and there will be clear somebody like Matt drudge with one of the biggest
[02:55:34.100 --> 02:55:40.660]  sites in the world you know traffic is is funding so he's there
[02:55:40.660 --> 02:55:44.420]  trumps there behind the scenes there are some groups you're right the mercers
[02:55:44.420 --> 02:55:50.380]  the coax their establishment it's all compared I'm crap well and and they're
[02:55:50.380 --> 02:55:56.620]  demonetizing you know they demonetize I'd say at least about 80% of my videos I
[02:55:56.620 --> 02:56:01.740]  do have some patreon people that and that that's really helpful and and in a
[02:56:01.740 --> 02:56:05.220]  way it's good because it's gonna force people on the right to kind of be more
[02:56:05.220 --> 02:56:09.940]  creative and explored other options yeah well you're saying you're you're
[02:56:09.940 --> 02:56:13.900]  willing to work your ass off and reach billions of people you just need to have
[02:56:13.900 --> 02:56:18.580]  your uniform and your information warfare weapon and food in your backpack
[02:56:18.580 --> 02:56:24.180]  right right and and that the cool thing is though in a way though it's forcing
[02:56:24.180 --> 02:56:29.180]  us to be better while at the same time it's making the left lazy and stupid
[02:56:29.180 --> 02:56:33.060]  because they're not they're not they don't have to work within these
[02:56:33.060 --> 02:56:38.540]  constraints so they're very new and they and they here's the deal they made a
[02:56:38.540 --> 02:56:43.060]  calculation to ban me it only made us bigger in many ways little people banning
[02:56:43.060 --> 02:56:45.780]  them destroys them because they think they're done they don't do their own
[02:56:45.780 --> 02:56:49.500]  thing it makes them stronger actually but because we know that rule they are
[02:56:49.500 --> 02:56:52.820]  really freaking out right now but I agree with what you're saying well and
[02:56:52.820 --> 02:56:57.300]  another thing that I don't think they've really taken into consideration is if
[02:56:57.300 --> 02:57:03.860]  there's anything that brings people together it's persecution and the
[02:57:03.860 --> 02:57:08.060]  censorship that you know you've experienced probably one of the most
[02:57:08.060 --> 02:57:13.140]  extreme cases right now but the censorship that's pretty much I mean
[02:57:13.140 --> 02:57:18.420]  it's far and wide on the right I've had video that they recently sent me an
[02:57:18.420 --> 02:57:22.540]  email I forget which video it is off the top of my head but they said this
[02:57:22.540 --> 02:57:28.020]  doesn't violate our terms of service or our guidelines but we're going to age
[02:57:28.020 --> 02:57:32.980]  restricted anyway because we want to like they literally say in the email it
[02:57:32.980 --> 02:57:38.060]  doesn't agree their terms of service they've gone from acting with us like oh
[02:57:38.060 --> 02:57:43.180]  there's this reason or that now they just go yes you're gone because we

[03:00:41.740 --> 03:00:47.660]  woman is angered by that what type of cults telling us that men women that's
[03:00:47.660 --> 03:00:52.940]  our species that's our journey for all these eons together and you don't really
[03:00:52.940 --> 03:00:58.700]  think we started off here to you that's hilarious

[03:01:20.820 --> 03:01:26.060]  Lord have mercy all right let's go back for this segment the next and then
[03:01:26.060 --> 03:01:28.980]  Nick baggage the guy that exposed all the big secret tech and everything
[03:01:28.980 --> 03:01:33.140]  totally vindicated it's taken over Rob do's coming in real briefly though huge
[03:01:33.140 --> 03:01:38.180]  news on this Florida fraud the hacking the scams I mean this is a real war
[03:01:38.180 --> 03:01:44.860]  we're in continuing mr. Stack of blackpill.com Devon Stack I've been
[03:01:44.860 --> 03:01:47.300]  asking questions here there's only four minutes left in this segment well
[03:01:47.300 --> 03:01:50.500]  another ten minute segment coming up what do you want to get into about this
[03:01:50.500 --> 03:01:55.740]  world because I agree you're not being negative saying we're in an exterminous
[03:01:55.740 --> 03:01:59.660]  globalist transhumanist plan where these angry globalist believe humans are
[03:01:59.660 --> 03:02:02.900]  obsolete because they hate themselves subconsciously but aren't sophisticated
[03:02:02.900 --> 03:02:07.060]  enough is psychopaths and genetic psychopaths and sociopaths to understand
[03:02:07.060 --> 03:02:12.180]  they're projecting their hate of us which is really hate on themselves they
[03:02:12.180 --> 03:02:17.060]  don't get it Trump gets it this is the alternate plan like here's the deal
[03:02:17.060 --> 03:02:22.380]  imagine QAnon attacking me shing Jones is an agent sessions is the best Trump
[03:02:22.380 --> 03:02:26.660]  loves him well I'm not gonna go on air and say what Trump told me about John
[03:02:26.660 --> 03:02:30.860]  McCain or what he said about sessions I'm gonna leave it at that but you I'm
[03:02:30.860 --> 03:02:36.140]  real Trump talks to me everybody knows that it's like I'm a real person I'm
[03:02:36.140 --> 03:02:39.540]  telling you Trump doesn't like these people and it's saying press the attack
[03:02:39.540 --> 03:02:43.340]  Jones I'm gonna leave it at that and then says here's this campaign person
[03:02:43.340 --> 03:02:47.740]  I'll talk to them they'll talk to you and I'm a little bit out here the enemy
[03:02:47.740 --> 03:02:51.700]  has my phone staff they know this and then I've got to see some person that
[03:02:51.700 --> 03:02:56.180]  doesn't say who they are anonymously saying I'm against Trump no I'm not you
[03:02:56.180 --> 03:03:02.700]  idiots go ahead well the thing one of things that tip me off to really kind of
[03:03:02.700 --> 03:03:07.580]  doubting the veracity of QAnon too was it was he was trying to play that or he
[03:03:07.580 --> 03:03:13.020]  or she or whoever was trying to play this game of I have to be anonymous so
[03:03:13.020 --> 03:03:17.600]  that you know that no one can know that this information is coming from the
[03:03:17.600 --> 03:03:21.420]  White House but at the same time I'm gonna give you these this proof that
[03:03:21.420 --> 03:03:25.740]  proves that I am who I am well it's like you can't have it both ways if you had
[03:03:25.740 --> 03:03:29.900]  something that conclusively proved who you were something that proved that you
[03:03:29.900 --> 03:03:33.140]  were coming from the White House there'd be absolutely no reason to be
[03:03:33.140 --> 03:03:37.220]  anonymous you know and and so you have a lot of people that are kind of latching
[03:03:37.220 --> 03:03:41.660]  on to what many things but some of these things are coincidences some of these
[03:03:41.660 --> 03:03:46.300]  things are just doing research you know it's not that hard to to find out what
[03:03:46.300 --> 03:03:50.940]  kind of phrasing Trump repeats in his tweets and then try to emulate stuff
[03:03:50.940 --> 03:03:56.620]  like that but people like the fortune cookie or the fortune hunt right they
[03:03:56.620 --> 03:04:00.180]  like the mystery show the people doing this I know who they are it was a group
[03:04:00.180 --> 03:04:04.220]  of leftist inside the CIA and psych warfare programs I know folks that were
[03:04:04.220 --> 03:04:08.080]  actually knew who they were they even lied to sent comma said oh no we're
[03:04:08.080 --> 03:04:13.380]  pro-trump and then I was told by sent com and I mean like the hit I'm not gonna
[03:04:13.380 --> 03:04:17.620]  get into it they said blow this operation and I did they even because we
[03:04:17.620 --> 03:04:21.140]  weren't sure that we weren't sure who they were at first you understand that
[03:04:21.140 --> 03:04:25.860]  well and the thing that let me know I wasn't sure honestly either when they
[03:04:25.860 --> 03:04:29.420]  first when it's for I didn't want to talk about it until like I could see
[03:04:29.420 --> 03:04:34.100]  where this was going but I don't there was a lot of youtubers making a lot of
[03:04:34.100 --> 03:04:39.620]  money quite frankly to covering you're so smart I'm not kissing your ass you
[03:04:39.620 --> 03:04:44.620]  just did it right there I noticed right away if we covered QAnon in a positive
[03:04:44.620 --> 03:04:48.740]  way this is the accidents we did early on it was suddenly pushed with millions
[03:04:48.740 --> 03:04:55.060]  of views in total monetization and that's what I went ah the globalists know
[03:04:55.060 --> 03:04:58.500]  that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the
[03:04:58.500 --> 03:05:03.460]  bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that it lowers IQ it
[03:05:03.460 --> 03:05:08.260]  literally dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and
[03:05:08.260 --> 03:05:13.180]  viewers the best idea in the world we've gone through two permutations first
[03:05:13.180 --> 03:05:17.380]  seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalist
[03:05:17.380 --> 03:05:21.260]  tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals of
[03:05:21.260 --> 03:05:26.220]  pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible now due to the
[03:05:26.220 --> 03:05:30.740]  establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the
[03:05:30.740 --> 03:05:35.300]  deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemist scientists and others showed
[03:05:35.300 --> 03:05:39.420]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of
[03:05:39.420 --> 03:05:46.140]  iodine and vitamin C it supercharges it and makes it even more bio available
[03:05:46.140 --> 03:05:49.500]  ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see it it's an
[03:05:49.500 --> 03:05:55.460]  incredible discovery x3 now available at m4slife.com
[03:05:55.460 --> 03:06:08.540]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide
[03:06:08.540 --> 03:06:12.660]  it's alex jones
[03:06:12.660 --> 03:06:25.780]  you can't go to his website right now it's down because of being hammered by
[03:06:25.780 --> 03:06:30.780]  massive traffic and he deserves it black pill.com Devin Stack another
[03:06:30.780 --> 03:06:35.020]  patriot in his last two years two and a half years stood up what's it mean to
[03:06:35.020 --> 03:06:39.020]  stand up an army it means you decide to stand up you're ready you're ready for
[03:06:39.020 --> 03:06:43.300]  war information warfare and that's why I always had this vision all these
[03:06:43.300 --> 03:06:47.140]  incredible minds of men and women of a race color and creed standing up for
[03:06:47.140 --> 03:06:52.740]  the Renaissance growing this whole planet it's just like an egg just one
[03:06:52.740 --> 03:06:58.140]  little jump point we'll look back later and say why was it so hard once we've
[03:06:58.140 --> 03:07:02.300]  gone to these next heights but it's only because when the real challenges come
[03:07:02.300 --> 03:07:10.220]  in the future we'll realize that we've already come this far together what
[03:07:10.220 --> 03:07:15.020]  matters is the saga continues the long march here's a few minutes from that
[03:07:15.020 --> 03:07:20.420]  video we mentioned one of hundreds of amazing ones that Devin Stack breaks
[03:07:20.420 --> 03:07:25.220]  down where he's getting into some of the scams out there not the bitcoin to
[03:07:25.220 --> 03:07:29.220]  scam it's great but that some of the scam groups out there and how they
[03:07:29.220 --> 03:07:33.380]  implode it like he shed and then how it ties into the QAnon globalist operation
[03:07:33.380 --> 03:07:37.780]  here it is I wanted to watch these people who had been calling me a shill or
[03:07:37.780 --> 03:07:42.940]  worse all because I was trying to help them get their just desserts but I
[03:07:42.940 --> 03:07:48.660]  never I mean I never got the satisfaction I was hoping for it was it was
[03:07:48.660 --> 03:07:56.020]  just sad all I saw was a mix of devastation and denial people saying
[03:07:56.020 --> 03:07:59.940]  they'd lost everything people that were going to be homeless now there were
[03:07:59.940 --> 03:08:05.020]  also people who I I would be surprised if they did not commit suicide the the
[03:08:05.020 --> 03:08:09.460]  language that was being used I mean people were ruined by this but also in
[03:08:09.460 --> 03:08:13.740]  all this devastation there was also the denial there were people that even though
[03:08:13.740 --> 03:08:18.140]  the value of bit connect had literally gone to zero still thought that this was
[03:08:18.140 --> 03:08:23.340]  all disinformation and that all everyone on earth but them had fallen for the
[03:08:23.340 --> 03:08:28.140]  disinformation and that now they were gonna double down and buy even more bit
[03:08:28.140 --> 03:08:32.580]  connect and people did people bought more even after it had gone to basically
[03:08:32.580 --> 03:08:36.980]  zero people bought more bit connect there was even like a little mini pump
[03:08:36.980 --> 03:08:43.540]  after the crash I don't know why but I mean so needless to say I didn't get
[03:08:43.540 --> 03:08:46.900]  the satisfaction I was looking for it was it was just sad it's a perfect
[03:08:46.900 --> 03:08:52.540]  cat because the human devastation that was dealt it was dealt out to people who
[03:08:52.540 --> 03:08:56.020]  just wanted to have hope they just wanted to have some dreams come true and
[03:08:56.020 --> 03:09:02.860]  honestly it takes a certain kind of person to use trust in humanity and
[03:09:02.860 --> 03:09:10.340]  hope against people so not only were there these human casualties but you
[03:09:10.340 --> 03:09:14.260]  know what did this mean for the future of cryptocurrency how many of these people
[03:09:14.260 --> 03:09:18.260]  you think that had been financially ruined by the bit connect scam whatever
[03:09:18.260 --> 03:09:23.540]  invest in crypto again probably almost none of them there was no silver lining
[03:09:23.540 --> 03:09:28.180]  bit connect had just been one giant disaster for everyone involved so now
[03:09:28.180 --> 03:09:33.020]  that I've explained bit connect to everybody I guess I should talk about
[03:09:33.020 --> 03:09:45.500]  QAnon or maybe maybe I just did for Blackpill I'm Devin Stack so there's a
[03:09:45.500 --> 03:09:48.500]  Devin Stack we're gonna go back to him for like eight minutes I want to come
[03:09:48.500 --> 03:09:51.860]  back with us in the near future maybe even host an hour or something so you
[03:09:51.860 --> 03:09:54.380]  can get all prepared do it do it his way of sending me interrupting every 10
[03:09:54.380 --> 03:09:59.820]  seconds but if you want hope believe in God and yourself and believe in the long
[03:09:59.820 --> 03:10:06.620]  road and believe in ideology and systems the only the magic bots or magic
[03:10:06.620 --> 03:10:11.060]  systems that's all we are you know Oprah Winfrey is the secret yes you have the
[03:10:11.060 --> 03:10:14.940]  destiny of the universe yes God made you the image but you don't just instantly
[03:10:14.940 --> 03:10:19.260]  abracadabra make things and so people want that lottery ticket they want that
[03:10:19.260 --> 03:10:24.420]  oh you know I'm not gonna listen to you I've had family you know swindled by the
[03:10:24.420 --> 03:10:27.540]  Nigerian scams they don't want to believe they're being scammed I say hey
[03:10:27.540 --> 03:10:30.620]  that's a scam you're just jealous I've got this big opportunity with Prince
[03:10:30.620 --> 03:10:36.580]  Boo Boo and it becomes the same thing over and over again so you were going to
[03:10:36.580 --> 03:10:43.620]  break their earlier Mr. Stack and you were getting into how everybody that
[03:10:43.620 --> 03:10:48.460]  promoted QAnon everybody promoted like the YouTube didn't stand the way Google
[03:10:48.460 --> 03:10:52.380]  just pumped it they pushed it for me I was like why have I covered QAnon
[03:10:52.380 --> 03:10:56.260]  positively trying to be nice up front as it suddenly goes super viral and
[03:10:56.260 --> 03:11:01.300]  there's no monetary restriction which made me stop covering and I said I think
[03:11:01.300 --> 03:11:06.020]  this is bad that they want us to do this it's all Pavlovian carrot and stick so
[03:11:06.020 --> 03:11:10.460]  so so get into that well and the weird thing is that that clip you just played
[03:11:10.460 --> 03:11:14.500]  that video is rated G there's nothing offensive about there's nothing I mean
[03:11:14.500 --> 03:11:17.180]  because I barely actually talked about QAnon it's really mostly about Bit
[03:11:17.180 --> 03:11:21.620]  Connect so it's there's no reason for them to demonetize that video at all and
[03:11:21.620 --> 03:11:26.620]  they demonetized it and I was like okay that's you know if I needed some kind of
[03:11:26.620 --> 03:11:32.420]  confirmation that I was on the right track there it is and yeah meanwhile like
[03:11:32.420 --> 03:11:36.620]  you said there's all these other channels that are totally they're staying
[03:11:36.620 --> 03:11:43.020]  monetized while they're they're spreading the QAnon stuff so it I didn't
[03:11:43.020 --> 03:11:46.540]  need anything more than that I mean that was enough and then just out of
[03:11:46.540 --> 03:11:50.740]  curiosity I and this is before you started seeing like the t-shirts and the
[03:11:50.740 --> 03:11:57.740]  signs everywhere at the rallies I just searched on Amazon and eBay for QAnon
[03:11:57.740 --> 03:12:02.820]  and there were just and it probably still are just pages and pages and pages of
[03:12:02.820 --> 03:12:08.780]  shirts and key chains and you know just people making a buck off so the deep so
[03:12:08.780 --> 03:12:12.660]  the deep state algorithm is shoving this is that that's got to tell us something
[03:12:12.660 --> 03:12:17.860]  well and then you saw it like and this was a couple months ago when what was it
[03:12:17.860 --> 03:12:23.980]  like vice and all these other guys basically would find QAnon believers or
[03:12:23.980 --> 03:12:27.100]  whatever you want to call them and and try to make them look stupid and just
[03:12:27.100 --> 03:12:30.300]  see like oh look at these stupid Trump supporters they believe in this stupid
[03:12:30.300 --> 03:12:34.260]  you know I mean so it was it was real I mean I saw that coming a mile away and
[03:12:34.260 --> 03:12:37.380]  as soon as the that was the other thing I was trying to explain to people that
[03:12:37.380 --> 03:12:41.380]  they were into it I was like why would if this was all true information why would
[03:12:41.380 --> 03:12:46.180]  they be why would Comedy Central be bringing people's attention to it you
[03:12:46.180 --> 03:12:51.020]  know like why would they do a even if sure it's making fun of it but all press
[03:12:51.020 --> 03:12:55.980]  is good press in some ways but see I agree with you argument that oh they
[03:12:55.980 --> 03:12:59.900]  attack all shows well they attack me it's to say I'm doing racist things I
[03:12:59.900 --> 03:13:03.980]  should be banned they weren't saying and QAnon with me it was different it's like
[03:13:03.980 --> 03:13:08.700]  Jones did this oh and shroyers mean to black people ban him and it's not true
[03:13:08.700 --> 03:13:11.420]  you see there's two different things if they're just promoting it making fun
[03:13:11.420 --> 03:13:17.060]  yes but they're saying ban you an association it's different right now
[03:13:17.060 --> 03:13:22.140]  and they made no attempt to ban QAnon it was it was a good it was a nice
[03:13:22.140 --> 03:13:26.620]  target for them you know they could they could point it at at QAnon and say
[03:13:26.620 --> 03:13:31.620]  look at the crazy Trump supporters and at the same time it also helped by doing
[03:13:31.620 --> 03:13:36.820]  that it helps like I said there's there's there was some truth in what some of
[03:13:36.820 --> 03:13:39.780]  what QAnon sure it covered real things let me ask this question you're a smart
[03:13:39.780 --> 03:13:43.500]  guy I haven't had time to track it I'm so busy covering the news what are they
[03:13:43.500 --> 03:13:49.100]  doing now these these pro QAnon people they're like Trump love sessions and
[03:13:49.100 --> 03:13:54.940]  Jones is going to prison and I stick with the president Jones woke me up but
[03:13:54.940 --> 03:13:59.660]  Jones is with the bad guys now what are those people thinking now that
[03:13:59.660 --> 03:14:04.060]  everything we told him is happening I think the election brought a lot of them
[03:14:04.060 --> 03:14:07.260]  around I mean there's some that are gonna hold on forever I mean you know
[03:14:07.260 --> 03:14:11.340]  there's nothing I knew as soon as the election results came in because that
[03:14:11.340 --> 03:14:15.700]  was the big thing right was the elections gonna happen they're gonna win the
[03:14:15.700 --> 03:14:21.260]  House and the Senate and that's when sessions is gonna swoop in and start
[03:14:21.260 --> 03:14:26.500]  sending everyone to Guantanamo Bay and I knew that that was unlikely that they
[03:14:26.500 --> 03:14:30.700]  would run win the House and the Senate and as soon as I saw that they lost the
[03:14:30.700 --> 03:14:35.500]  House I was like okay so first of all you had a lot of people that probably
[03:14:35.500 --> 03:14:40.540]  didn't go vote because all over the internet Google is hammering we won
[03:14:40.540 --> 03:14:47.460]  it's over don't vote everything's fine well and even far as the enemy even
[03:14:47.460 --> 03:14:51.420]  Fox News called the election like 90 minutes before like while voting was
[03:14:51.420 --> 03:14:54.700]  still going on and you notice now the Democrats are stealing Florida and
[03:14:54.700 --> 03:14:59.340]  Arizona right now well right and then that's actually not a thing it's kind
[03:14:59.340 --> 03:15:03.180]  of frustrating because I just saw on Twitter like a couple minutes before I
[03:15:03.180 --> 03:15:08.260]  came on here that the and I forget the name of the agency the agency that's in
[03:15:08.260 --> 03:15:13.860]  charge of investigating voter fraud just said they responded to a reporter that
[03:15:13.860 --> 03:15:18.180]  asked hey are you investigating what's going on in Florida they said no we can't
[03:15:18.180 --> 03:15:22.460]  until the State Department tells us to and they haven't told us to what shows
[03:15:22.460 --> 03:15:27.140]  the State Department is still Democrat run you made videos on that Devon I'm

[03:20:01.300 --> 03:20:23.780]  Alex Jones the cure to fake news coming to you live from Austin, Texas
[03:20:23.780 --> 03:20:30.020]  Alright Dr. Nick Baggis is taking over the next half hour then the war room with
[03:20:30.020 --> 03:20:35.300]  Owen Shroyer, Roger Schoen and others is wound up like racehorses in the gates
[03:20:35.300 --> 03:20:40.940]  ready infowarstore.com forward slash show you know I there's a lot of it
[03:20:40.940 --> 03:20:44.780]  gotten to the doubt we've done an okay job. Well you know one thing I didn't
[03:20:44.780 --> 03:20:49.420]  realize Alex I didn't realize that QAnon was an old Southern gentleman who
[03:20:49.420 --> 03:20:54.220]  sips lemonade out by the porch. You're doing that QAnon voice earlier? Alex
[03:20:54.220 --> 03:20:59.260]  Jones is a bad man he's going to jail. I didn't realize that too. Alex Jones hates
[03:20:59.260 --> 03:21:05.980]  Trump and hates America. He wants to turn in your guns boy. Alex Jones but we are
[03:21:05.980 --> 03:21:14.500]  secret over here. I don't know what he's doing. Trust the plan it gets you there
[03:21:14.500 --> 03:21:21.740]  right now my babies. You don't trust him Jones it gets you a lot more. So you learn
[03:21:21.740 --> 03:21:25.380]  something new every day. I try to learn a few things every day but that I did not
[03:21:25.380 --> 03:21:30.140]  know. It's total operatives. The point is I didn't want to even get into it but my
[03:21:30.140 --> 03:21:36.560]  god how obvious is it. Now here's the deal. A lot is going on. We are in the
[03:21:36.560 --> 03:21:39.940]  middle of a solar war in this country against foreign global forces and if we
[03:21:39.940 --> 03:21:44.220]  can just point out hey it's foreign chai common EU and banking forces I think
[03:21:44.220 --> 03:21:47.020]  they run America and use our open society as a way to get in and do this and
[03:21:47.020 --> 03:21:50.340]  Trump's just an American who doesn't think we should give the country out and
[03:21:50.340 --> 03:21:55.380]  they think that's mentally ill then it's over like join America or don't. There's
[03:21:55.380 --> 03:21:59.580]  not even a discussion at this point. People say like Alex used to be
[03:21:59.580 --> 03:22:03.380]  independent against Republicans and Democrats and then Trump comes along and
[03:22:03.380 --> 03:22:08.460]  suddenly you're fully behind it because Trump I built at we built the audience
[03:22:08.460 --> 03:22:13.780]  built a big missile launching base and then Trump the missile arrived on the
[03:22:13.780 --> 03:22:18.460]  back of a big missile launching truck. We want America. We want to control
[03:22:18.460 --> 03:22:22.540]  our own country. We want to cut taxes. We want you to defeat globalism. We want
[03:22:22.540 --> 03:22:28.940]  to leave families alone. Trump we built Trump. Trump is ours. This is it. He
[03:22:28.940 --> 03:22:32.900]  wouldn't have been able to do this if we hadn't been here and we wouldn't do it
[03:22:32.900 --> 03:22:38.620]  if he wasn't there. It's destiny folks. It's here and you see the full attack of
[03:22:38.620 --> 03:22:43.820]  the enemy because it is real. Yeah they act like why are you the whole
[03:22:43.820 --> 03:22:47.700]  establishment against Trump. Exactly you have to have a disruptor for any real
[03:22:47.700 --> 03:22:51.100]  change to happen in this world and we know we've been controlled by giant
[03:22:51.100 --> 03:22:55.740]  multinational corporations and Trump is all Trump is is a person that has come
[03:22:55.740 --> 03:23:00.180]  in and said you know what I'm going to unbuckle the latches that are holding you
[03:23:00.180 --> 03:23:03.780]  down but it's up to you to make the change and be the change you want to see
[03:23:03.780 --> 03:23:08.660]  in this world. Well why so he's like this is a super rich country in position. Why
[03:23:08.660 --> 03:23:13.340]  because a bunch of leftist robber-bearing kids have needle dick syndrome. Should we
[03:23:13.340 --> 03:23:17.020]  sign it over the Chinese that half their country doesn't have running water and bow
[03:23:17.020 --> 03:23:21.780]  down to them. I mean it's like it's not even like a wimpy thing like oh I love
[03:23:21.780 --> 03:23:26.620]  America. It's like dude this is BS. We're in command. Why would we try to make
[03:23:26.620 --> 03:23:31.020]  people poor. Why would we try to like break up family so much of professors you
[03:23:31.020 --> 03:23:33.860]  know again that have needle dick syndrome can feel powerful. That's why
[03:23:33.860 --> 03:23:38.140]  they're so scared because the real obviousness is in American supremacy not
[03:23:38.140 --> 03:23:43.260]  through weapons but through ideas and Russia is like a woman like Marilyn
[03:23:43.260 --> 03:23:47.100]  Rowe in bed waiting for us. Everything is ready. They don't want radical Islam.
[03:23:47.100 --> 03:23:51.540]  No one does. They want 57 Chevy's. They want power. They want success. They want
[03:23:51.540 --> 03:23:55.820]  space programs. They want huge space operations. They want just get out of the
[03:23:55.820 --> 03:24:02.300]  way man. Move bitch. Get out the way. Move bitch. So this is it and we will not
[03:24:02.300 --> 03:24:06.140]  we will not fail. No not at this point. But imagine being a chicken crap globalist
[03:24:06.140 --> 03:24:09.460]  from the chicken you know what dimension. Chicken S.A. dimension. It's my
[03:24:09.460 --> 03:24:15.380]  coin term. They see freedom and middle classes and expansion is scary. We don't
[03:24:15.380 --> 03:24:19.140]  know. We can't have that. We can't have that. We can't have that. Oh god. Everyone's
[03:24:19.140 --> 03:24:23.300]  getting along and we're controlling and being happy. Let's teach them in the name
[03:24:23.300 --> 03:24:28.180]  of diversity that everyone hates each other. Exactly. And it's a reality goes
[03:24:28.180 --> 03:24:31.780]  straight up. They really have created half the population is mentally ill and
[03:24:31.780 --> 03:24:35.260]  they you can show them a video of Jim Acosta hitting a woman's arm like he
[03:24:35.260 --> 03:24:38.140]  didn't touch her. He didn't touch her. He said he didn't touch her. He said it on
[03:24:38.140 --> 03:24:41.980]  TV. That must mean it's true. Well let's talk about the IT guy and control the
[03:24:41.980 --> 03:24:45.620]  situation of Florida. He's a special little character. Well so right now
[03:24:45.620 --> 03:24:48.420]  they're having this recount in Florida. They're having one in Arizona one in
[03:24:48.420 --> 03:24:51.820]  Georgia and it looks like they're trying to steal these things and so the lady in
[03:24:51.820 --> 03:24:55.260]  charge of the flow in Broward County seems to be the key which is what we
[03:24:55.260 --> 03:24:59.740]  said that night. Stone brought it up and now they find these provisional ballots.
[03:24:59.740 --> 03:25:05.820]  Okay. Well here's the guy. So at the end of the day all this has to go through a
[03:25:05.820 --> 03:25:09.300]  company and so there's a company called Cloudflare that is watching and
[03:25:09.300 --> 03:25:14.580]  monitoring election sites. They hired this man Joe Sullivan who is he's one of
[03:25:14.580 --> 03:25:20.540]  Cloudflare security officers. Okay. Before that he was working at Uber and he
[03:25:20.540 --> 03:25:25.700]  got fired from Uber after Uber got hacked and where they stole 57 million
[03:25:25.700 --> 03:25:32.420]  people's data. What he did was pay off the hackers and got them to say hey you
[03:25:32.420 --> 03:25:38.620]  guys y'all are part of our program. Let's meet Bain. Yeah. Yeah. So now that
[03:25:38.620 --> 03:25:42.220]  and this guy before that he worked in Facebook. He worked at eBay. He worked at
[03:25:42.220 --> 03:25:48.260]  Airbnb but Obama's Cybersecurity Council was also where he was. So he's the
[03:25:48.260 --> 03:25:53.540]  anointed one. This is who's in charge of the share all the digital keys and you
[03:25:53.540 --> 03:25:56.740]  have Broward. Which which which Apple has moved to China and given to them. So
[03:25:56.740 --> 03:26:01.220]  he's he's a very nice person. Exactly. So it's very interesting when you see
[03:26:01.220 --> 03:26:06.420]  where you know these people go and you look at their past areas and that
[03:26:06.420 --> 03:26:09.180]  just came through the wire and I'm looking at him like well now it's starting
[03:26:09.180 --> 03:26:11.900]  to make sense. They got the people in place. Notice Jeb Bush is the one who
[03:26:11.900 --> 03:26:16.060]  put in this lady. What's her name? Stackers or a group keeper. Yeah. The
[03:26:16.060 --> 03:26:20.100]  group keeper down there. Jeb Bush put her in charge and it's how can you not
[03:26:20.100 --> 03:26:23.500]  get these people out once they go in. It was like the election judge. Every
[03:26:23.500 --> 03:26:28.180]  election magically there's 50 million ballots needed. Yeah. They're the state
[03:26:28.180 --> 03:26:32.500]  population and Broward County's got them. Oh they do. And they find them. Brenda
[03:26:32.500 --> 03:26:36.620]  Snipes. That's who it is. Brenda Snipes. 80,000 votes arrive and no one asked
[03:26:36.620 --> 03:26:39.620]  where are these trucks coming from? Where'd you find these? Oh we had them in
[03:26:39.620 --> 03:26:43.820]  the back all the whole time. They were. There's somebody else showed a
[03:26:43.820 --> 03:26:48.100]  picture of here they are and there's a box and there's papers on top of it like
[03:26:48.100 --> 03:26:52.660]  we found more ballots and it's just it's insanity after insanity. So hopefully
[03:26:52.660 --> 03:26:56.420]  the lawyers are in place and the lawyers are monitoring this stuff so they
[03:26:56.420 --> 03:27:00.500]  can try to steal ballot box underneath some folders. There it is. They're trying
[03:27:00.500 --> 03:27:04.380]  to steal a Senate seat. Oh they can steal three Senate seats. And they're doing the
[03:27:04.380 --> 03:27:07.660]  same thing. They can steal three Senate seats right now and then get this stuff
[03:27:07.660 --> 03:27:11.460]  back to square one almost. So now and all makes sense when you see Ruth Bader
[03:27:11.460 --> 03:27:16.180]  Ginsburg not looking so good. They just released her out of the hospital and
[03:27:16.180 --> 03:27:20.500]  man she did not look good. TMZ has a video ever being wheeled off into a
[03:27:20.500 --> 03:27:24.660]  car. She was able to stand up and get into the car but she's looking more and
[03:27:24.660 --> 03:27:28.620]  more like Hillary Clinton. You know that's terrible. It is. But they're gonna
[03:27:28.620 --> 03:27:31.540]  have to replace her. It's just terrible. And that's what they don't want. Not a good
[03:27:31.540 --> 03:27:47.340]  omen. Well. There she is right there. Things aren't going too well. The jaws of
[03:27:47.340 --> 03:27:52.620]  hell open wide. Lucifer's tongue rolls out dripping with the blood of the
[03:27:52.620 --> 03:27:57.460]  innocent awaiting new souls. And a special shell of the night circle is
[03:27:57.460 --> 03:28:04.620]  prepared. I sense Amy Coney Barrett getting nominated for the Supreme Court.
[03:28:04.620 --> 03:28:08.420]  Just watching this video right here very soon within a year. With definitely
[03:28:08.420 --> 03:28:13.020]  within a year. Well they're trying to prop her up. Yeah. Alyssa Milano wanted to
[03:28:13.020 --> 03:28:24.220]  give her some ribs, a kidney and a lung offer. Good. Good. You have done well Lord Vick.
[03:28:24.220 --> 03:28:38.580]  Anyways coming up. America's mine. From destiny. I the fallen will soon rise
[03:28:38.580 --> 03:28:47.060]  against you. And all of your spirals will be mine. But in the end the Wicked were only meant to awaken the righteous.
[03:28:47.060 --> 03:28:53.060]  Dr. Nick Beggis straight ahead. And in the war room. T-minus 30 minutes info wars.com.

[03:29:56.580 --> 03:30:00.500]  all getting punch-drunk to the censorship and you saw 18 Twitter accounts
[03:30:00.500 --> 03:30:03.380]  they say affiliated with Info Wars. Yes some of them are like little side
[03:30:03.380 --> 03:30:06.380]  accounts they even know we had like Info Wars stores that just showed our
[03:30:06.380 --> 03:30:10.740]  products but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a
[03:30:10.740 --> 03:30:14.620]  Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us. Your excitement
[03:30:14.620 --> 03:30:17.580]  about America your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country
[03:30:17.580 --> 03:30:21.660]  and the world back from the break. But the globalists now want to target where
[03:30:21.660 --> 03:30:26.140]  the resistance came from so that we're not pesky in the future. I want to be
[03:30:26.140 --> 03:30:31.660]  troublesome and pesky. I want to keep going. I want to make them do the ultimate
[03:30:31.660 --> 03:30:36.020]  not just destroy us financially. I want to push all the way. I've committed to do
[03:30:36.020 --> 03:30:39.900]  that. I've prayed for that and I've been told that's going to happen but you've
[03:30:39.900 --> 03:30:44.700]  got a backish and I promise you this. I will never falter. I will never waver at
[03:30:44.700 --> 03:30:48.540]  the spiritual level. I physically will. But I give you my commitment if you
[03:30:48.540 --> 03:30:53.220]  financially support us at foreshore.com to give you my absolute total
[03:30:53.220 --> 03:30:56.620]  commitment. We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it
[03:30:56.620 --> 03:31:01.060]  together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very
[03:31:01.060 --> 03:31:04.700]  best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body. That's
[03:31:04.700 --> 03:31:09.860]  why I'm introducing Z Shield. Toxic metal and chemical defense support. It's made
[03:31:09.860 --> 03:31:14.780]  in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[03:31:14.780 --> 03:31:18.140]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the infor. It is a
[03:31:18.140 --> 03:31:22.820]  classical 360 win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for
[03:31:22.820 --> 03:31:26.900]  over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it
[03:31:26.900 --> 03:31:30.820]  comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to
[03:31:30.820 --> 03:31:34.580]  your family and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that
[03:31:34.580 --> 03:31:39.700]  patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we
[03:31:39.700 --> 03:31:43.980]  need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next
[03:31:43.980 --> 03:31:47.460]  level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support and
[03:31:47.460 --> 03:31:50.660]  your prayers together. We're changing the world. Now it's time to change our
[03:31:50.660 --> 03:31:55.580]  bodies with Z Shield and inforwarslife.com. The globalists know that if they
[03:31:55.580 --> 03:31:58.780]  suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens,
[03:31:58.780 --> 03:32:03.460]  fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ. It literally
[03:32:03.460 --> 03:32:08.140]  dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers
[03:32:08.140 --> 03:32:13.340]  the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations. First seaweed
[03:32:13.340 --> 03:32:17.140]  based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried
[03:32:17.140 --> 03:32:21.220]  to block us getting a supply of it, so we discovered deep earth crystals of pure
[03:32:21.220 --> 03:32:25.860]  nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible. Now, due to the
[03:32:25.860 --> 03:32:30.340]  establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the
[03:32:30.340 --> 03:32:34.900]  deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists, scientists and others showed
[03:32:34.900 --> 03:32:39.020]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of
[03:32:39.020 --> 03:32:45.780]  iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:32:45.780 --> 03:32:49.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an
[03:32:49.140 --> 03:32:55.100]  incredible discovery. X3, now available at inforwarslife.com.
[03:32:55.100 --> 03:33:04.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:04.020 --> 03:33:26.180]  And welcome back to infowars.com and this is Dr. Nick Begich and I'm in for the
[03:33:26.180 --> 03:33:32.340]  last half hour of today's broadcast and you know thinking about where Alex left
[03:33:32.340 --> 03:33:37.780]  off in the last segment, you know, Trump is the antidote, you know what I'm saying?
[03:33:37.780 --> 03:33:42.740]  I mean really, if you think about what's been shaken up in the last couple of
[03:33:42.740 --> 03:33:49.380]  years, it's pretty outstanding all the way around and as I look forward, you
[03:33:49.380 --> 03:33:52.020]  know, right now, this is really an important time, you know, people are
[03:33:52.020 --> 03:33:56.820]  still thinking about all the elections and how the house switched. This could be
[03:33:56.820 --> 03:34:02.780]  the most powerful lame duck session in history if we think about that way and
[03:34:02.780 --> 03:34:07.220]  you know, there's still a few months left to get some things done, you might say.
[03:34:07.220 --> 03:34:13.980]  Well, there's majorities in both the house and the Senate. Are they bold
[03:34:13.980 --> 03:34:18.860]  enough? Are they strong enough? Will they do it? I don't know, but they sure could.
[03:34:18.860 --> 03:34:23.300]  They're still in charge until January, third week in January, so I would
[03:34:23.300 --> 03:34:31.580]  suggest contact your congressional delegation and ask them to back up Trump
[03:34:31.580 --> 03:34:38.460]  and get the agenda done. We only had a few months left, so clear out the calendar
[03:34:38.460 --> 03:34:43.980]  and get people to work. Let's see what happens and then we got
[03:34:43.980 --> 03:34:48.060]  gridlocked, right, for the next two years to see what happens and that's really
[03:34:48.060 --> 03:34:52.660]  unfortunate as I look at what's happening in the world today. You know, when you
[03:34:52.660 --> 03:34:59.340]  think about the Senate, it's still a majority. Republican, the house obviously,
[03:34:59.340 --> 03:35:06.820]  went the other way, but everybody gets sworn in the beginning of the year. So
[03:35:06.820 --> 03:35:13.220]  we have a few months, might interrupt a few party plans, but so to speak, but it's
[03:35:13.220 --> 03:35:19.420]  time to do it. You know, I'm thinking about really what this last election was
[03:35:19.420 --> 03:35:24.100]  about. You know, they tried to make it about people, personalities, all this
[03:35:24.100 --> 03:35:30.300]  stuff, and they forget the idea that it's really about ideas. What does the
[03:35:30.300 --> 03:35:36.140]  country believe in? What does the population want to see change or
[03:35:36.140 --> 03:35:43.700]  happen in this next couple of years? And you have to be active, you have to get
[03:35:43.700 --> 03:35:48.280]  involved, and at some level, now's the time really to think about what's happened
[03:35:48.280 --> 03:35:53.660]  in personal privacy. The idea that this broadcast is being restricted, the idea
[03:35:53.660 --> 03:35:59.180]  of information being restricted two years out, lame duck session. Let's address
[03:35:59.180 --> 03:36:02.980]  some of the privacy issues, the communication issues, and make sure we
[03:36:02.980 --> 03:36:07.620]  have an open, fair and free press. You know, and everyone's talking about fair
[03:36:07.620 --> 03:36:11.700]  trade, about a fair and free press, so we can even have a conversation about
[03:36:11.700 --> 03:36:16.580]  free trade and what all that means. You know, and all the other important issues
[03:36:16.580 --> 03:36:22.740]  that Americans deal with, and our true allies around the world do as well. So
[03:36:22.740 --> 03:36:29.740]  now's really a time to use the lame duck session, address the holes in the
[03:36:29.740 --> 03:36:34.180]  program that need to be filled right now. And the biggest one is to make sure we
[03:36:34.180 --> 03:36:38.540]  have the ability to get our messages out, to have our conversation with the
[03:36:38.540 --> 03:36:41.900]  public. And if people don't like what's being said, they have the right of
[03:36:41.900 --> 03:36:47.980]  everyone else to do exactly what you can do. Change the channel, you know. But to
[03:36:47.980 --> 03:36:53.740]  shut the channel down is not the way of a Democratic Republic and something, if
[03:36:53.740 --> 03:37:01.940]  we haven't learned anything that we better understand. So, you know, it's now is the
[03:37:01.940 --> 03:37:07.020]  time. Let's see what we can do. Let's see what happens. And if we have the bold
[03:37:07.020 --> 03:37:14.100]  leadership we need to push back before it's too late in January. Think about
[03:37:14.100 --> 03:37:17.940]  gridlock, you know, and the kind of compromises that will be made. Some will
[03:37:17.940 --> 03:37:24.500]  be good, some maybe not so good, maybe nothing meaningful will happen again for
[03:37:24.500 --> 03:37:27.980]  a couple years, which given the way things have rolled that really wouldn't
[03:37:27.980 --> 03:37:35.700]  surprise me. I'm looking at my notes from today, and I want to talk about what
[03:37:35.700 --> 03:37:40.460]  you'll see over the next couple years if we don't push it back now. In terms of
[03:37:40.460 --> 03:37:46.140]  personal privacy, transparency, and government, the idea of being able to
[03:37:46.140 --> 03:37:51.820]  stay on the track that we've been on that's created the most vibrant
[03:37:51.820 --> 03:37:58.740]  economy in modern history and many, many people's lifetimes as a matter of fact.
[03:37:58.740 --> 03:38:06.540]  But think about that right now, because that's what's at stake right now, is
[03:38:06.540 --> 03:38:11.020]  that economy. And there's some things that I think we need to remember too
[03:38:11.020 --> 03:38:18.380]  about just stagnation. You know, no change may be as good in some arenas, but the
[03:38:18.380 --> 03:38:23.100]  kind of change and trajectory we've been on has been the most aggressive we've
[03:38:23.100 --> 03:38:32.020]  seen forever. But privacy, transparency, and true ability to maintain our free
[03:38:32.020 --> 03:38:38.740]  speech are the critical elements of this generation. If we don't do it, and now
[03:38:38.740 --> 03:38:42.740]  is the time, we're literally at five minutes to midnight, the house is going
[03:38:42.740 --> 03:38:48.740]  to change in January, protect freedom, personal privacy, and the right for all
[03:38:48.740 --> 03:38:53.860]  of us to communicate equally on the platforms that represent modern
[03:38:53.860 --> 03:39:00.300]  technology. You know, when I think about Alex and where Info Wars started, for
[03:39:00.300 --> 03:39:06.300]  those that remember, you know, it was on public access channels, you know, and
[03:39:06.300 --> 03:39:12.540]  Alex worked and scraped his program together and built a team and a
[03:39:12.540 --> 03:39:19.500]  network that is affected. And that was the point of Alex's last segment, was
[03:39:19.500 --> 03:39:26.260]  that combination of the truth, warriors out there that are willing to engage it
[03:39:26.260 --> 03:39:34.380]  and jump in to the Info War, quite frankly, and be heard and make a
[03:39:34.380 --> 03:39:38.300]  difference. And that's what's happened, and that's why the pushback has been so
[03:39:38.300 --> 03:39:44.980]  extreme by the other side these days. So, you know, I mean, I think about the
[03:39:44.980 --> 03:39:50.260]  elections a lot was gained in terms of lessons learned, but now really is the
[03:39:50.260 --> 03:39:57.220]  eleventh hour, and we have to regain the freedom of speech and debate before we
[03:39:57.220 --> 03:40:03.340]  go into this next two years. You know, the other issues I want to get into
[03:40:03.340 --> 03:40:10.860]  today, I want to talk a little bit about, again, taking a broader vision for
[03:40:10.860 --> 03:40:14.860]  America and the United States right now, things that can be done, because a lot can
[03:40:14.860 --> 03:40:18.620]  be done regardless, through the executive, through regulation, through
[03:40:18.620 --> 03:40:23.420]  executive order, with or without the Congress, as we saw during the Obama
[03:40:23.420 --> 03:40:28.380]  administration. So, I mean, there's on balance some things the executive can do
[03:40:28.380 --> 03:40:33.700]  within his authority and within the Constitution and things the legislative
[03:40:33.700 --> 03:40:42.100]  bodies can do after the new legislature is sworn in in January. And in the
[03:40:42.100 --> 03:40:47.460]  meantime, there's a lot to be done. You know, when I think about, again, the
[03:40:47.460 --> 03:40:56.020]  the issue of reality creation, I mean, think about where people get their news
[03:40:56.020 --> 03:41:05.820]  and the channeling of that news being now imposed on even a broader way by the
[03:41:05.820 --> 03:41:10.860]  big players in communications on the planet today, in terms of how people
[03:41:10.860 --> 03:41:17.180]  really communicate, socialize, or what have you. I mean, think about how people's
[03:41:17.180 --> 03:41:24.420]  time use has moved into a venue where everything about you can be understood
[03:41:24.420 --> 03:41:30.700]  and seen in such a way that the pushback is the total invasion of
[03:41:30.700 --> 03:41:36.580]  privacy. You know, at Infowars, at theinfowarsstore.com, they carry my books
[03:41:36.580 --> 03:41:41.100]  and videos, and there's two that are really important on these issues. And they
[03:41:41.100 --> 03:41:44.460]  were written a while ago, and they were forecast for the future, the future we're
[03:41:44.460 --> 03:41:53.460]  having now, okay? And Earth Rising, Earth Rising 2, both at Infowarsstore.com in
[03:41:53.460 --> 03:41:59.460]  the bookstore. When you go that route, you really support Alex and the network,
[03:41:59.460 --> 03:42:04.260]  and I appreciate it also supports my work. But when you look at privacy and what
[03:42:04.260 --> 03:42:10.100]  we saw coming, and then sort of how it all came through control of various
[03:42:10.100 --> 03:42:16.460]  aspects of entertainment, media, really shaping and pushing the direction of
[03:42:16.460 --> 03:42:23.420]  which all of us have been headed. Over the last 25 years, it's now a quarter
[03:42:23.420 --> 03:42:29.780]  of a century of this work. You know, I hear music kicking in, I know we're
[03:42:29.780 --> 03:42:34.300]  coming into a break, and we're gonna be back in a few minutes. You listen to Dr.

[03:45:57.460 --> 03:46:00.340]  Years ago, InfowarsLife created the powerful
[03:46:00.340 --> 03:46:04.620]  MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast. As the years went on and
[03:46:04.620 --> 03:46:08.020]  more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to
[03:46:08.020 --> 03:46:11.980]  create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health. MycoZX
[03:46:11.980 --> 03:46:16.060]  Plus is the result of the search for that formula. A unique natural formula

[03:46:35.100 --> 03:46:39.340]  extract, poudarco bark, and grape seed extract, our formula is fueled by

[03:47:17.180 --> 03:47:33.260]  And welcome back to Infowars.com. This is Dr. Nick Faggich, and I'm standing in
[03:47:33.260 --> 03:47:38.820]  this last hour on a Friday. I want to shift gears a little bit here, and I
[03:47:38.820 --> 03:47:44.140]  want to talk about another important area that is always a part of the subject
[03:47:44.140 --> 03:47:49.660]  matter on Infowars is China right now. And I talked to one of my friends. My
[03:47:49.660 --> 03:47:56.340]  buddy has traveled, most traveled guy, I know, over 140 countries, several of them
[03:47:56.340 --> 03:48:02.980]  a lot of times, including China from the early 1980s to this last year. So
[03:48:02.980 --> 03:48:06.660]  spanning a pretty good amount of time, and he's been there four times China alone.
[03:48:06.660 --> 03:48:10.620]  So I'm talking to him. We have an ongoing conversation. I have a conversation with a
[03:48:10.620 --> 03:48:15.860]  lot of people, a lot of places around the world. And with my friend, his last
[03:48:15.860 --> 03:48:22.260]  trip to China is observations. And look at where China sits on the Pacific Rim.
[03:48:22.260 --> 03:48:29.020]  It went from bicycles from the early 80s and a few cars all the way over to
[03:48:29.020 --> 03:48:34.300]  automobiles and mopeds, right? Now on the screen is a map showing the Pacific Rim,
[03:48:34.300 --> 03:48:38.460]  and you can see its relationship directionally from the United States. And
[03:48:38.460 --> 03:48:43.060]  look at where Alaska sits and that chain of islands that sits out there. How
[03:48:43.060 --> 03:48:50.180]  close we are to Korea, Japan, China, Australia even, you know, when you think
[03:48:50.180 --> 03:48:55.860]  about the Pacific Rim as a trading belt. Well, most of the trade now is happening
[03:48:55.860 --> 03:49:04.300]  India, China, Asia, and Alaska situated ideally. And if you look at the map of
[03:49:04.300 --> 03:49:11.060]  just Alaska, Canada, and the United States for a moment, and look at how far
[03:49:11.060 --> 03:49:17.340]  apart Alaska is from the rest of the United States. You know, it's a 1,500
[03:49:17.340 --> 03:49:23.860]  mile trip by air from Anchorage to Seattle. And you know, that's just to get
[03:49:23.860 --> 03:49:29.420]  to the next state, okay? But then look at the size proportionally of Alaska and
[03:49:29.420 --> 03:49:35.420]  recognize a couple of things. Firstly, if you take all of Alaska's coastline from
[03:49:35.420 --> 03:49:39.660]  southeast all the way down the Aleutian chain, all around the top of the state,
[03:49:39.660 --> 03:49:47.500]  the whole coastline is bigger than the entire West Coast, East Coast, and Gulf
[03:49:47.500 --> 03:49:53.780]  Coast to the United States combined, okay? And if you think about Alaska, if you
[03:49:53.780 --> 03:49:58.620]  look at the map again on the screen, Alaska, South Central Alaska, and a little
[03:49:58.620 --> 03:50:04.980]  bit in the southeastern quarter is where all the roads virtually are. The rest of
[03:50:04.980 --> 03:50:12.220]  state is empty space. As an example, Alaska is 20% of the land mass. If Alaska
[03:50:12.220 --> 03:50:18.580]  had 20% of the population, we'd have about, what, 60, 65 million people? We
[03:50:18.580 --> 03:50:24.260]  don't. We have 750,000, you know? Seattle has more people. Most big cities on the
[03:50:24.260 --> 03:50:29.860]  West Coast have more people. Most of Alaska is really wilderness. Looking at
[03:50:29.860 --> 03:50:34.140]  the Google map, looking for roads, you won't find any because there aren't any
[03:50:34.140 --> 03:50:41.740]  to speak of. Most of it is empty, again, empty space. And as a consequence, the
[03:50:41.740 --> 03:50:48.500]  biggest resource treasury here in the United States is underutilized. And if
[03:50:48.500 --> 03:50:52.260]  you look at what China has done, when they've looked at the globe and they've
[03:50:52.260 --> 03:50:57.020]  recognized, first of all, they're a huge land mass with tremendous natural
[03:50:57.020 --> 03:51:01.420]  resources of all kinds. They produce most of the rare earth minerals, like 90% in
[03:51:01.420 --> 03:51:05.980]  the world. A lot of strategic minerals they produce. And what they don't produce,
[03:51:05.980 --> 03:51:12.020]  they've gone to Africa and Latin America and throughout Asia and created
[03:51:12.020 --> 03:51:16.340]  relationships and moved millions of their people and population to these
[03:51:16.340 --> 03:51:23.580]  these areas of the world to develop mines and smelters and shipping and ports
[03:51:23.580 --> 03:51:31.540]  and infrastructure and roads and railroads, etc. etc. throughout the world to
[03:51:31.540 --> 03:51:37.820]  move commodities into their country and store huge amounts of surpluses of most
[03:51:37.820 --> 03:51:41.860]  commodities that they don't have access of. When the prices are low, they stock
[03:51:41.860 --> 03:51:48.740]  up. They convert US treasuries and US currency and all the trade notes, our
[03:51:48.740 --> 03:51:56.780]  deficits, get converted into real stuff. And what they don't have and they
[03:51:56.780 --> 03:52:02.340]  can't make, they go out and buy it somewhere in the world. Even if they have
[03:52:02.340 --> 03:52:07.460]  to pay a premium out to outbid the West, they'll pay 10, 15% over. Even when a
[03:52:07.460 --> 03:52:12.220]  market says something's worth, if you go, why would they do that? Because holding
[03:52:12.220 --> 03:52:17.620]  the treasuries that relative to values of dollars, inflation, all those factors
[03:52:17.620 --> 03:52:25.140]  over time decreases anyway. So dump all this stuff and get real stuff that over
[03:52:25.140 --> 03:52:29.900]  the long run goes the other direction. It appreciates because it's real value.
[03:52:29.900 --> 03:52:36.700]  They're commodities, real value, real economic value. Currency is just the
[03:52:36.700 --> 03:52:43.700]  fiction in between, the trade in between the paper. The paper isn't where it's at
[03:52:43.700 --> 03:52:49.060]  and the Chinese realize it. And that's where we have fallen behind. And for the
[03:52:49.060 --> 03:52:53.100]  challenge for the next administration, when the Obama administration tried to
[03:52:53.100 --> 03:52:58.860]  stimulate the economy, I called it the biggest repaving program in the history
[03:52:58.860 --> 03:53:05.140]  of America. Project ready, project ready. What a bunch of nonsense. We went into debt
[03:53:05.140 --> 03:53:12.140]  up to our eyeballs building meaningless infrastructure on so many levels. And what
[03:53:12.140 --> 03:53:20.980]  is meaningful infrastructure? It's roads to natural resources. It's like
[03:53:20.980 --> 03:53:28.260]  creating an airport next to your treasury. You know, you might want to move the
[03:53:28.260 --> 03:53:34.980]  treasury somewhere someday. And Alaska is it. And here's what's happening here
[03:53:34.980 --> 03:53:41.020]  right now. This week was the miners' convention. Happens every year. And a lot
[03:53:41.020 --> 03:53:45.980]  of people come and present what they're developing and what's coming online. And
[03:53:45.980 --> 03:53:54.180]  there are huge, huge projects coming online. But the sands and roads being
[03:53:54.180 --> 03:53:58.220]  built with state resources combined with industry, they're building a couple
[03:53:58.220 --> 03:54:02.500]  hundred miles of roads to one copper deposit up north. But they're doing
[03:54:02.500 --> 03:54:08.980]  things. And my view is railroads to riches. And the reason I say that is,
[03:54:08.980 --> 03:54:16.260]  you know, we have an opportunity in Alaska and in the United States to build
[03:54:16.260 --> 03:54:21.740]  railroad links that connect these mineral belts and oil and gas fields and
[03:54:21.740 --> 03:54:30.180]  areas to the rest of the national capital base, which is all the factories and
[03:54:30.180 --> 03:54:34.380]  all the potential. But we have to have a rail link that hooks us to the Canadian
[03:54:34.380 --> 03:54:38.340]  rail system so that we can move commodities economically from Alaska.
[03:54:38.340 --> 03:54:42.380]  And then we need to branch that rail system in the national interest to all
[03:54:42.380 --> 03:54:47.780]  of those strategic locations in Alaska. Now, if you look at Southeast Alaska and
[03:54:47.780 --> 03:54:54.700]  you go down to the Juno-Haines area, which is off right along the coast
[03:54:54.700 --> 03:54:58.820]  to Canada, you'll see it in the lower portion of Alaska. In this area, we
[03:54:58.820 --> 03:55:03.380]  have tide water resources in deep ports because the mountains literally end in
[03:55:03.380 --> 03:55:07.620]  the sea. And you can see on the map on the screen now Southeast Alaska. And you
[03:55:07.620 --> 03:55:13.060]  can see Juno and just the whole area. And it's all fjords if you look at that.
[03:55:13.060 --> 03:55:16.860]  That's just like Norway, where the mountains just end in the sea and drop
[03:55:16.860 --> 03:55:21.900]  down, you know, a thousand feet deep, you know, and hundreds of feet deep. So you
[03:55:21.900 --> 03:55:27.780]  can get right in and what has been found there in one area near Ketchikan,
[03:55:27.780 --> 03:55:35.140]  Alaska, down in the very, very tip on the southern end of Southeast, is a huge
[03:55:35.140 --> 03:55:41.820]  deposit of rare earth minerals being developed by Eucor, rare earth metals.
[03:55:41.820 --> 03:55:46.740]  And they've also developed technology. In fact, they just bought the rights to
[03:55:46.740 --> 03:55:54.500]  this worldwide technology that converts these very complex ores into 99.9%
[03:55:54.500 --> 03:56:01.900]  pure rare earth elements out of their processing method, a patented method
[03:56:01.900 --> 03:56:06.580]  that's been tested over the last six or seven years in prototypes. And now
[03:56:06.580 --> 03:56:11.300]  they're building their first production facility in Ketchikan, Alaska. You know,
[03:56:11.300 --> 03:56:15.220]  when you think about other things that are important with 21st century,
[03:56:15.220 --> 03:56:22.740]  copper, zinc, of course, cobalt, titanium, tungsten, iron, all of these things are in
[03:56:22.740 --> 03:56:27.780]  huge, huge quantities in Alaska and several mines are in advanced stages of
[03:56:27.780 --> 03:56:34.420]  permitting headed into development. And this is exciting stuff. But once you move
[03:56:34.420 --> 03:56:39.620]  off of tide water, the logistics start to move away from you pretty quickly. And
[03:56:39.620 --> 03:56:45.300]  this is where we have an opportunity now to build roads, railroads, and ports to
[03:56:45.300 --> 03:56:48.940]  move these natural resources to US markets where they can be made into
[03:56:48.940 --> 03:56:54.260]  things and value added and exported again. The big changes are coming in
[03:56:54.260 --> 03:56:59.380]  robotics, which is going to drive industry in the 21st century. The next time I'm on,
[03:56:59.380 --> 03:57:07.180]  I want to talk about robotics and the impact that's coming. This is huge and
[03:57:07.180 --> 03:57:11.380]  it's going to cause the biggest displacement in labor and the workforce
[03:57:11.380 --> 03:57:17.900]  as a factor of economic production in the history of mankind and it's upon us.
[03:57:17.900 --> 03:57:24.820]  It's coming in this century, much of it in our lifetimes. This is Dr. Nick
