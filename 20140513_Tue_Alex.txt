[00:00.000 --> 00:12.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.480 --> 00:38.400]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.400 --> 00:43.440]  man I get in here after looking at the news last night and this morning and I
[00:43.440 --> 00:48.080]  just think what am I gonna cover not because there isn't a lot of news there
[00:48.080 --> 00:52.560]  is just too much of it and it's all just gets crazier and crazier and more
[00:52.560 --> 00:57.760]  interesting by the minute well it's been discovered found after 500 years of the
[00:57.760 --> 01:03.600]  wreck of the Christopher Columbus flagship the Santa Maria that's the type
[01:03.600 --> 01:08.160]  of news we're gonna be talking about here today Warren Buffett gives 1.2
[01:08.160 --> 01:12.240]  billion to abortion groups yes he's a eugenicist we're gonna be explaining
[01:12.240 --> 01:18.480]  that today coal rules will devastate the u.s. economy say business groups well
[01:18.480 --> 01:22.800]  that's the plan we're gonna be breaking that down hedge fund titans are testing
[01:22.800 --> 01:27.760]  the quality of u.s. democracy financial times of London just admits the big
[01:27.760 --> 01:32.240]  hedge funds basically run the government yeah they lobby for higher taxes on the
[01:32.240 --> 01:36.000]  middle class and no taxes on themselves they're the ones that lobby to take our
[01:36.000 --> 01:39.920]  guns you'd say why are the big banks and hedge funds and investment banks doing
[01:39.920 --> 01:44.400]  that because they've taken the country over by criminal action and now they
[01:44.400 --> 01:47.920]  don't want us ever getting it back they want to secure what they've conquered
[01:47.920 --> 01:56.400]  through fraud and the Rolling Stone even CNBC financial times of London they
[01:56.400 --> 02:01.320]  all admit what we've been telling you forever that central bankers rule the
[02:01.320 --> 02:04.800]  world because they have unlimited fractional reserve banking fiat
[02:04.800 --> 02:11.400]  derivative counterfeit instruments and until we focus on that and how it's
[02:11.400 --> 02:15.280]  illegitimate and how it gives them a monopoly of currency and credit things
[02:15.280 --> 02:20.280]  are only gonna get worse folks oh and by the way what's the mindset what is the
[02:20.280 --> 02:28.000]  piloting directive the prime directive of the globalist eugenics and not your
[02:28.000 --> 02:31.280]  granddaddy's eugenics that he was told about where oh we get rid of the poor
[02:31.280 --> 02:35.320]  people and build up the middle class no no no they sold the middle class on that
[02:35.320 --> 02:39.720]  in the last 170 years in Europe the United States in England it was always
[02:39.720 --> 02:44.160]  targeting the middle class so there's there's no debate about eugenics is it
[02:44.160 --> 02:49.680]  good or is it bad it's targeting the best people it's targeting the
[02:49.680 --> 02:55.160]  competitors of the establishment so it's a lie even in the way it's taught and
[02:55.160 --> 02:59.240]  you don't learn what real eugenics says until you become basically an inner
[02:59.240 --> 03:05.000]  party member and that will dovetail into Warren Buffett who's given himself more
[03:05.000 --> 03:11.800]  than $50 billion tax-free to his own tax-free foundation that runs for
[03:11.800 --> 03:18.680]  profit businesses then they take part of the profit and give it to federalization
[03:18.680 --> 03:24.520]  the corporatization of education abortions anti-gun groups I mean Warren
[03:24.520 --> 03:28.640]  Buffett Bill Gates give two groups that want to take your guns they're bigger
[03:28.640 --> 03:35.040]  donors than them Bloomberg but but you never hear about it Warren Buffett has
[03:35.040 --> 03:38.800]  this whole act like he likes to play tennis and eat ice cream cones and he
[03:38.800 --> 03:42.880]  loves the children and he wants rich people to pay more taxes because he's
[03:42.880 --> 03:47.520]  the one who literally is the biggest beneficiary of the bailout and doesn't
[03:47.520 --> 03:52.400]  pay taxes on it so he says he wants the rich to pay more taxes because he's not
[03:52.400 --> 03:56.120]  and he makes it oh that you know person make a hundred thousand dollars a year
[03:56.120 --> 03:59.640]  they should pay taxes and I know I say this every day in the three hours because
[03:59.640 --> 04:05.640]  it's the key to everything if we have a national debate about how these insiders
[04:05.640 --> 04:09.200]  are exempt from the system they're putting on us they're not just exempt
[04:09.200 --> 04:12.880]  from some other system they're exempt from the system they're putting on our
[04:12.880 --> 04:18.640]  backs and they've got us going uphill carrying a rucksack full of boulders
[04:18.640 --> 04:22.200]  while they're on a magic carpet flying around telling us how lucky we are to be
[04:22.200 --> 04:27.560]  carrying the rocks up the hill for them and I personally am tired of it I'm
[04:27.560 --> 04:32.120]  personally you could take fiat currency and fiat systems properly deployed and
[04:32.120 --> 04:39.000]  build a powerful civilization with it but it always allows the evil people to
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.680]  dominate cut corners and cheat then they become decadent then they believe
[04:42.680 --> 04:45.960]  their God's gift to the earth through fraud then they say hey there's seven
[04:45.960 --> 04:48.680]  billion people we ought to kill a bunch of them we've already take the planet
[04:48.680 --> 04:52.160]  over via fraud we don't want to have all these people on our planet eating
[04:52.160 --> 04:56.800]  our food messing up our paradise so now they're savers of the planet when
[04:56.800 --> 05:00.640]  really they're just usurping criminal scum
[05:00.640 --> 05:04.640]  the globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time but
[05:04.640 --> 05:08.560]  now they're expanding making the weaponization even more vicious and
[05:08.560 --> 05:13.080]  deceptive all the major networks are state-run we are partnering this year

[09:19.600 --> 09:24.320]  obviously and then we do have several guests joining us
[09:24.320 --> 09:27.680]  wolf gain how big former state police officer
[09:27.680 --> 09:31.360]  and runs one of the largest school training safety
[09:31.360 --> 09:34.720]  organizations in the country he's also been a school principal after he's in the
[09:34.720 --> 09:38.720]  state police in i think it was florida but the whole point is
[09:38.720 --> 09:42.400]  that he's done an investigation and he says looks like sandy hooks totally
[09:42.400 --> 09:46.640]  staged and we know they've declared state secrets
[09:46.640 --> 09:50.560]  on it bulldoze the school he went to the school board meeting
[09:50.560 --> 09:53.360]  and they actually turned the cameras off shut everything down and wouldn't let
[09:53.360 --> 09:57.360]  him speak even in the allotted time so they're acting very
[09:57.360 --> 10:03.440]  very very very suspicious and folks if they'll pull off all the
[10:03.440 --> 10:06.480]  hooks as we've seen like fast and furious you name it they will pull
[10:06.480 --> 10:11.840]  anything off and we're gonna get an update from him
[10:11.840 --> 10:16.880]  coming up because yesterday it was in national news that
[10:16.880 --> 10:21.360]  they shut down that school board meetings we'll repull that article as well
[10:21.360 --> 10:25.360]  and get to that here's the headline new town school board shuts down
[10:25.360 --> 10:30.560]  conspiracy theorist discovery.com see if you don't believe known certified
[10:30.560 --> 10:33.920]  liars if you question obama saying there is no
[10:33.920 --> 10:39.040]  $5,000 fee per employee who doesn't get obama care
[10:39.040 --> 10:45.920]  kicking in in 2015 and on many businesses in 2014
[10:45.920 --> 10:48.880]  if you don't believe obama when he says a ball face lie you're a conspiracy
[10:48.880 --> 10:50.800]  theorist or if he says you didn't build your small
[10:50.800 --> 10:53.760]  business and you say yes i did you're a conspiracy theorist
[10:53.760 --> 10:57.920]  or if you know he says raising the debt limit doesn't raise the national debt
[10:57.920 --> 11:00.800]  and you say it does raise the national debt you're a conspiracy theorist
[11:00.800 --> 11:04.000]  if you say two plus two equals four and not five
[11:04.000 --> 11:08.400]  you're a conspiracy theorist now you say that birds fly and the ducks quack
[11:08.400 --> 11:12.160]  you're a conspiracy theorist if you say the government is
[11:12.160 --> 11:14.800]  completely out of control and militarizing against this
[11:14.800 --> 11:18.160]  you're a conspiracy theorist if you point out that our government's publicly
[11:18.160 --> 11:22.400]  funding al-qaeda and running them worldwide they'll admit it's true but
[11:22.400 --> 11:28.960]  still call you a conspiracy theorist so we're going to get him on
[11:28.960 --> 11:34.560]  and then we've got joel gilbert uh who made the film dreams of my real father
[11:34.560 --> 11:38.000]  really devastating obama and why his wife said he was from kinnia
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.280]  and all those speeches why his harvard review journal
[11:41.280 --> 11:44.320]  that he was the editor of said he was born in kinnia
[11:44.320 --> 11:49.280]  and why they acted the whole time like uh that was a conspiracy and and and we
[11:49.280 --> 11:52.320]  bought into one level of it it was an adjaprop that
[11:52.320 --> 11:57.760]  steve patrinik was talking about agitation propaganda
[11:57.760 --> 12:01.280]  where you where and i should be more sophisticated but it took us years to
[12:01.280 --> 12:06.080]  figure out why they put out such blatant fake um
[12:06.080 --> 12:10.160]  such blatant fake uh birth certificates why why they admitted he was from kinnia
[12:10.160 --> 12:14.560]  we're like they admit he's from kinnia they've declared national security in
[12:14.560 --> 12:18.400]  kinnia to cover it up he looks nothing like his father though
[12:18.400 --> 12:21.920]  and it's because we know who his dad really was a famous communist and
[12:21.920 --> 12:26.080]  pornographer in hawaii photos of his mother
[12:26.080 --> 12:29.840]  you know they're with him and and then obama later on the same couch
[12:29.840 --> 12:35.840]  where the pornos are filmed betty page style stuff i mean it's just
[12:35.840 --> 12:41.040]  amazing well i wanted to get him back on to talk about his latest project and a
[12:41.040 --> 12:45.600]  lot of new things uh that are that are breaking

[12:51.840 --> 12:55.040]  progressive rainbow so very important kind of in the same
[12:55.040 --> 13:00.400]  line uh as uh the new denisha susan film if he
[13:00.400 --> 13:04.320]  doesn't go to prison that's coming out july 4th and obama deception it's funny

[15:54.560 --> 15:59.440]  wag the dog moment says colonel alan west
[15:59.440 --> 16:03.520]  former congressman alan west was questioned and has questioned the
[16:03.520 --> 16:07.360]  timing of the obama administration's focus on the kidnapped
[16:07.360 --> 16:11.680]  nigerian schoolgirls saying it's fishy to him
[16:11.680 --> 16:15.280]  again the former army colonel said and former congressman
[16:15.280 --> 16:19.760]  uh ladies and gentlemen it's more than fishy hillary
[16:19.760 --> 16:28.160]  plenton put boku haram in a no penalty box
[16:28.160 --> 16:32.080]  to protect them just like they have a list of terrorists they're allowed to
[16:32.080 --> 16:37.360]  come in the u.s. and are left alone so that article the alan west
[16:37.360 --> 16:42.000]  article dove tales we'd have one of our people do a story on that
[16:42.000 --> 16:50.000]  dove tales with the dhs terrorist walk list
[16:50.000 --> 16:53.200]  because the real terrorists folks are precious little angels to the new world
[16:53.200 --> 16:55.840]  order this is how they get to invade all these countries take all our liberties
[16:55.840 --> 16:58.720]  i mean really it's an easy equation to understand
[16:58.720 --> 17:01.680]  that's why they attack the premise two plus two equals four because it's hiding
[17:01.680 --> 17:07.840]  in blind view but boka haram even the establishment
[17:07.840 --> 17:13.200]  road scholar best-selling author namie wolf has come out
[17:13.200 --> 17:17.680]  and said that clearly boka haram
[17:19.360 --> 17:25.520]  clearly they are a cia globalist front created the year obama got in in the
[17:25.520 --> 17:29.200]  administration and that's why it's so sick to see them using as an excuse to
[17:29.200 --> 17:33.520]  invade africa and militarize it as they use libya they've taken over the last
[17:33.520 --> 17:39.360]  three years as a new al-qaeda base
[17:39.360 --> 17:42.400]  and to have her on msnbc that really freaked them out
[17:42.400 --> 17:46.640]  namie wolf suggests boka haram is a cia conspiracy
[17:46.640 --> 17:53.280]  and they've got the neocom site um front page mag has been critical of me i
[17:53.280 --> 17:58.240]  know come out and say namie wolf endorsed the
[17:58.240 --> 18:02.400]  burqa despite building a career around claiming to be a feminist
[18:02.400 --> 18:08.160]  now she's opposing the plan to stone gay men under sharia law
[18:08.160 --> 18:12.800]  the one suspects that opponents because she opposes tpp
[18:12.800 --> 18:16.560]  a free trade agreement involving it just goes on
[18:16.560 --> 18:24.640]  a bernie why would anybody on the so-called right
[18:24.640 --> 18:29.920]  be defending hillary clinton right now when she
[18:29.920 --> 18:33.840]  made sure they didn't get on the terror list so that funds can keep going to
[18:33.840 --> 18:36.880]  them that's mainstream news she got criticized when she did it
[18:36.880 --> 18:40.880]  six years ago when obama got in office
[18:41.040 --> 18:47.200]  and why would they then tie it in to her other statements to discredit her
[18:47.200 --> 18:51.600]  it's just amazing because the truth is at the top the establishment does not
[18:51.600 --> 18:57.120]  want it known that the globalists are creating most of these radical muslims
[18:57.120 --> 19:01.920]  to again be used to scare us into submission to destroy our well of life
[19:01.920 --> 19:06.240]  and to secure the criminal takeover the entire homeland security apparatus is on
[19:06.240 --> 19:10.080]  record pointed at the tea party conservatives libertarians returning
[19:10.080 --> 19:13.840]  veterans christians and pro-lifers it's publicly

[19:21.520 --> 19:24.560]  to people now it's like yeah tell me something i don't know
[19:24.560 --> 19:27.440]  okay well now it's in forbs and it's in the washington times and it's in the
[19:27.440 --> 19:30.400]  associated press and it's on the discovery channel
[19:30.400 --> 19:35.120]  that the army's main domestic mission is taking on gun owners that's high treason
[19:35.120 --> 19:38.960]  we should not just accept this now we've it we
[19:38.960 --> 19:43.200]  they didn't want to expose because they wanted to secretly build this takeover
[19:43.200 --> 19:46.960]  we exposed it so it woke the military up because they're decompartmentalized
[19:46.960 --> 19:51.520]  now we've got to dismantle the domestic military that's totally unconstitutional

[24:06.800 --> 24:15.840]  wagesual on corruption crashing through the lies and disinformation
[24:15.840 --> 24:19.600]  i'm alex jones your host thank you so much for joining us on this
[24:19.600 --> 24:31.040]  live Tuesday the 13th day of May 2014. Let me just give you some of the headlines
[24:31.040 --> 24:37.200]  I'll get into the Warren Buffett story. Study people ignored on Facebook feel isolated, less
[24:37.200 --> 24:42.320]  meaningful existence. Other studies show the same thing people that use computers more than three
[24:42.320 --> 24:48.480]  hours a day. We'll be getting into those studies. Also we're going to give you the latest on the
[24:48.480 --> 24:56.640]  whole situation in Africa that's the Wag the Dog for Obama with Boku Haram leader running around
[24:56.640 --> 25:03.120]  in CIA central casting. Also a video that just went up on infowars.com with a full article is
[25:03.120 --> 25:09.200]  unbelievably shocking. Radio listeners should go watch it. Cops attack family with tasers and
[25:09.200 --> 25:18.320]  pepper spray for having party in their own home. And more and more I hear about people even having
[25:18.320 --> 25:24.800]  genteel parties and the cops are so afraid of parties of large groups that they send
[25:25.360 --> 25:30.160]  SWAT teams and most police departments are converting large segments of the force to
[25:30.160 --> 25:35.280]  quote SWAT teams even having them in areas like Denver run highway checkpoints randomly.
[25:35.280 --> 25:41.200]  You pull up the guys in mask with guns like you're in central Mexico or something. So we're
[25:41.200 --> 25:46.320]  going to be getting into that also exclusive after 500 years one of the biggest nautical
[25:46.320 --> 25:52.160]  undersea discoveries ever. The flagship of Christopher Columbus they believe they found
[25:52.160 --> 25:58.400]  will tell you about that and brain science fires up neurons of managers.
[26:00.080 --> 26:08.240]  Former Israeli PM Ahud Omer handed six year jail sentence for reportedly receiving millions of
[26:08.240 --> 26:16.160]  dollars of bribes. Folks at that level they're almost all involved in it in these major western
[26:16.160 --> 26:24.160]  governments and I'm not defending Ahud Omer but that is a tit for tat political thing against him.
[26:25.040 --> 26:29.920]  You got to wonder what he did that made somebody mad. That's just how it works. They can always
[26:29.920 --> 26:35.840]  find something. You can fill out your checkbook wrong. The online the FBI all call it wire fraud
[26:35.840 --> 26:42.880]  these days. It's a totally corrupt system with the largest prison population in the world in this
[26:42.880 --> 26:51.760]  country and they don't care if it's open tyranny. You can send drones out to kill US citizens you get
[26:51.760 --> 27:03.200]  a medal. Now let's get into the really serious news. Warren Buffett has given 1.2 billion to
[27:03.200 --> 27:11.920]  abortion groups. May 13th 2014 marks one year since Philadelphia abortion Dr. Kermit Gosnell
[27:11.920 --> 27:16.480]  was convicted of first-degree murder in the deaths of three babies who were delivered alive
[27:16.480 --> 27:21.120]  and then killed. I thought they're fetuses though because they were ruled babies. They are babies
[27:21.120 --> 27:27.280]  with scissors at his grimy house of horror clinic. As long as it's clean it's okay I guess. According
[27:27.280 --> 27:33.040]  to the Associated Press, Gosnell instantly became the face of abortion in the profile
[27:33.680 --> 27:40.080]  a pro-life community. And again here's my view on abortion. I don't judge people that have been
[27:40.080 --> 27:43.840]  involved in it. If they thought it was birth control they were young they were poor it was
[27:43.840 --> 27:48.800]  first trimester you didn't think you were killing a child. I'm not a hypocrite okay.
[27:49.920 --> 27:53.920]  But as you grow and you learn what's going on you learn there's more people that want to adopt
[27:54.480 --> 27:58.480]  than there even are abortions every year. That's why there's such a big export of babies that from
[27:58.480 --> 28:06.720]  outside the US mainly from Asia. That's why you discover that it's about a eugenics program of
[28:06.720 --> 28:12.720]  being anti-human. And then you learn that we're only getting about 1.3, 1.4 Americans born for
[28:12.720 --> 28:18.880]  every two adults. We want to be able to pay social security and everything. The West is dying in the
[28:18.880 --> 28:24.400]  words of Pat Buchanan. He wrote a book called that showing the demographics of it. The West,
[28:24.400 --> 28:31.760]  Germany, all of it, Japan is in the West. It's dying. The most advanced, most intelligence
[28:31.760 --> 28:38.080]  of high IQ countries on average are gone. They're already gone. There's no reversing it.
[28:38.800 --> 28:44.560]  And these are the countries where the biggest push goes to don't have kids. So it's the West
[28:44.560 --> 28:53.040]  committing suicide. Look at that headline. Millennials too realistic to have children
[28:53.040 --> 28:57.520]  huffington post. And look if you don't want to have kids more power to you that's your business.
[28:57.520 --> 29:02.560]  But they're setting up this tax system and everything where you can't afford to have kids.
[29:02.560 --> 29:07.680]  And it's a eugenics program. But the point is Warren Buffett put more than 50 billion dollars
[29:07.680 --> 29:10.480]  in the Bill and the Line Gates Foundation that he partners and shares with them.
[29:11.440 --> 29:16.480]  And it's all that his private companies end up the profit is tax-free and it's putting that.
[29:16.480 --> 29:22.720]  Then they take the skim off the top. His mansions, his helicopters, all of it. He has a small house
[29:22.720 --> 29:26.720]  in Omaha and part of a stage deal for the public. And you know, ice cream cones, he gets on TV,
[29:26.720 --> 29:31.360]  little non-threatening old man. He owns big banks through the majority launderers of drug money.
[29:32.000 --> 29:38.240]  And at least the aircraft to fly the narcotics. That's AP Bloomberg, you name it. But oh,
[29:38.240 --> 29:43.280]  he's Warren Buffett. He's sweet. Meanwhile, the cops are going to come to your school with
[29:43.280 --> 29:49.840]  checkpoints in the hallways, try to find marijuana. It is totally evil. It's totally evil.
[29:49.840 --> 29:54.800]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the G.N. radio network.
[29:54.800 --> 29:57.360]  And the G.N. radio network. And the G.N. radio network is coming up.
[30:24.880 --> 30:29.440]  a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions. And don't forget the fact
[30:29.440 --> 30:33.920]  that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well. When I began to research
[30:33.920 --> 30:39.520]  these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the
[30:39.520 --> 30:44.480]  toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against. Made with organic and
[30:44.480 --> 30:50.160]  wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA. The new Info Wars Life Lung Cleanse is here

[32:04.240 --> 32:10.000]  are manipulating our genetics. We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers

[34:06.240 --> 34:12.640]  criminal liars we are bad people all right I want to get to a plethora of special reports
[34:12.640 --> 34:17.840]  and a bunch of other news that I've mentioned but haven't dug into yet but finishing up with hair
[34:17.840 --> 34:27.040]  buffett who uses taxpayer money like a buffet for his giant criminal operations that he runs
[34:27.040 --> 34:35.520]  worldwide so we've got this article out of Fox News talking about how he is the biggest pusher
[34:36.080 --> 34:43.440]  and funder of abortionist after billa melinda gates the so-called oracle of Omaha has donated
[34:43.440 --> 34:50.240]  him more than 1.2 billion to abortion organizations in just the last 12 years now that's equal to
[34:50.240 --> 34:58.400]  the cost of roughly 2.7 million first trimester abortions more than twice the number of abortions
[34:58.400 --> 35:05.360]  that occur an entire year yeah in the last 12 years he's funded more than two years of the
[35:05.360 --> 35:11.760]  abortions unlike Gosnell however everything buffett has done has been entirely legal but
[35:11.760 --> 35:17.040]  buffett does share something else in common with the abortionist both their stories have been
[35:17.040 --> 35:25.040]  largely unreported wow what a powerful article by fox news by dan gainer we'll try to get dan
[35:25.040 --> 35:31.520]  gainer on because it goes on to show what an abortionist kingpin warren buffett is so people
[35:31.520 --> 35:37.600]  are going to jail for killing babies out of the womb what about him funding this undoubtedly going
[35:37.600 --> 35:44.800]  on out of the millions of abortions that this man has funded out of the 52 53 million that
[35:44.800 --> 35:51.760]  have happened since rovey weight and by the way if you watch my film in game warren buffett
[35:52.960 --> 36:01.440]  is no doubt in an intelligence agency from a very young age he has no doubt been working with bill
[36:01.440 --> 36:08.000]  gates his father who was in army intelligence and no doubt helped set up the management teams
[36:08.960 --> 36:17.120]  through different intelligence agencies to have ibm covertly fund a new doppelganger known as
[36:17.120 --> 36:23.360]  microsoft i mean i've done the research on this okay and these companies fight with each other at
[36:23.360 --> 36:31.680]  times they compete with each other at certain levels but back in the 70s into the 80s still anti
[36:31.680 --> 36:39.600]  trust laws were enforced in this country and ibm could not start you know have the sell the
[36:39.600 --> 36:46.000]  computers and have the software so they basically gave that if you research it and gave the monopoly
[36:46.000 --> 36:56.960]  to bill gates it's totally fake and then you understand that watson thomas watson and then
[36:56.960 --> 37:05.360]  his sons and the rest of them literally donated almost the full wealth of the ibm dynasty to
[37:05.360 --> 37:12.880]  will add off hitler until watson died until world war two and but he went on for a while before he
[37:12.880 --> 37:19.120]  died and that that's why the computers are integrated to control and dominate because
[37:19.120 --> 37:24.000]  from the beginning it's been about carrying out eugenics this is a eugenics cult
[37:27.360 --> 37:33.280]  you know the tattoos that were on the concentration camp people's arms of how many calories to give
[37:33.280 --> 37:37.680]  them how long they should be work should they be worked should they be killed those were put into
[37:37.680 --> 37:44.800]  the hollereth race mixing machines that were first used in the 20s in new york city under
[37:44.800 --> 37:51.600]  margaret sanger's directives and then they would do a hollereth test on poor white kids
[37:51.600 --> 37:56.960]  black kids it didn't matter and then they would decide and say well the machine said so whether
[37:56.960 --> 38:02.400]  you were going to be sterilized they have even pbs documentaries on this if you made under a b plus
[38:02.400 --> 38:09.520]  plus in public school and came from a single parent family they would then come to your house
[38:10.240 --> 38:15.120]  uh and grab you and take you away and sterilize you male or female that then got deployed into
[38:15.120 --> 38:20.000]  germany to the keiser villum institute and the rockefeller family institute and foundation
[38:20.000 --> 38:26.080]  and this is all best-selling you know Pulitzer prize winning books on the subject this is on record
[38:27.600 --> 38:32.320]  all came out during nurenberg but nobody over here got in trouble and then you go wait a minute
[38:32.320 --> 38:37.920]  why then did they want to sterilize people that had single parents and they know single parents
[38:37.920 --> 38:43.440]  statistically causes more crime and problems why do they then by the 60s decide to fund single parents
[38:43.440 --> 38:48.160]  well they shifted the plan they said no no no we're not going to have eugenics where we actually try
[38:48.160 --> 38:53.600]  to get rid of what we see as non-productive people which i'm not even defending that but you can see
[38:53.600 --> 39:00.000]  the argument we're going to go after the smartest people and put social engineering on them not to
[39:00.000 --> 39:06.560]  have kids and cultural engineering and we're going to go in and pay the poorest people to not be
[39:06.560 --> 39:12.240]  productive and just literally have them be our minions and then we'll recruit from them our enforcers
[39:12.240 --> 39:18.800]  our bureaucrats our governing class in the next phase then we'll set up a technocracy in the future
[39:18.800 --> 39:22.640]  when that technology has been developed and then we'll just exterminate everyone
[39:22.640 --> 39:26.800]  once our technocracies in place with the computers and robots and we're now
[39:26.800 --> 39:30.160]  entering that final phase of a total blueprinted plan
[39:31.920 --> 39:33.840]  man that's what you have to understand ladies and gentlemen
[39:35.760 --> 39:40.880]  is that this is all on record in my film end game blueprint for global enslavement almost
[39:40.880 --> 39:50.080]  three hours long it's really like three films and get it on dvd at info wars store.com watch it
[39:50.080 --> 39:58.080]  in high def at prism planet dot tv or see it medium res on youtube it's only got like four
[39:58.080 --> 40:03.120]  million views on youtube or four and a half million views on one if you add it all up before
[40:03.120 --> 40:06.400]  i got taken off google video and they got rid of that it had about eight million views on there
[40:07.760 --> 40:12.800]  but i mean this film's only been seen 14 15 million times that i know of on the big platforms
[40:12.800 --> 40:20.240]  and it should be seen more i mean it production wise it's good production but it's it's scholarly
[40:20.240 --> 40:28.640]  but also somewhat riveting and captivating to see reality and it tells you and breaks down improves
[40:29.440 --> 40:32.480]  why the globalists are doing what they're doing and what their plan is i mean it's just look
[40:32.480 --> 40:37.040]  there's a public plan the information is out there people ignore it at their peril
[40:37.040 --> 40:42.960]  i want to give you some other news here uh and and and then play this incredible audio and video
[40:42.960 --> 40:49.360]  out of houston of the police swat teaming just a family birthday party get together
[40:51.680 --> 40:59.440]  because they felt threatened by a group of people but before we go any further i cannot
[40:59.440 --> 41:05.040]  stress to you the fact that i'm under more stress than i've ever been under and then i'm performing
[41:05.040 --> 41:10.000]  better under that stress than i've ever done and it's undoubtedly i mean i'll tell the story now
[41:13.680 --> 41:14.720]  this is so important
[41:17.440 --> 41:19.520]  i ran six miles every other day
[41:22.800 --> 41:28.800]  i lifted weights every other day and i ate like a pig
[41:28.800 --> 41:36.640]  and i drank as much beer as i wanted to for the time i was about 18 to 22 not a lot of beer you
[41:36.640 --> 41:44.080]  know went out with the bodies went out two-step and all that on the weekends and looked like
[41:45.600 --> 41:52.800]  a mystery universe or something then i got dedicated to fighting the new world order
[41:52.800 --> 41:56.800]  got death threats got attacked physically you name it i decided hey i'm not going to be around
[41:56.800 --> 42:01.360]  that long i might as well just quit working out and just work 18 hours a day many days for years
[42:01.360 --> 42:06.080]  i worked 18 hours a day put down all those films building my own media organization everything
[42:07.280 --> 42:11.760]  and it worked okay the first two years or so but when the tabloids have slowed down and i gained 60
[42:11.760 --> 42:22.400]  pounds i went up from about 180 pounds to about 240 pounds then i gained even more weight and went
[42:22.400 --> 42:32.960]  up to 275 is the biggest i've ever been 275 i was about 275 about five six years ago
[42:35.040 --> 42:41.120]  looked pretty good for 275 i have gotten down to 230 pounds
[42:44.160 --> 42:49.440]  but here's the thing about five years ago i started working out swimming two miles a day
[42:49.440 --> 42:56.240]  several days a week two miles open swims i began doing five six seven mile hikes
[42:56.240 --> 43:02.640]  up hills cliffs i began doing all this stuff but didn't really change my diet as much as i should
[43:02.640 --> 43:07.840]  got more organic and didn't lose with about 10 pounds then i did some of the info wars health

[46:17.360 --> 46:21.920]  we covered warren buffet here is the hill newspaper and when we first covered this
[46:21.920 --> 46:29.120]  four years ago again the white house responded when drudge linked to our story
[46:30.640 --> 46:35.520]  and said that we were dangerous conspiracy theorist while i was covering the texas you
[46:35.520 --> 46:40.720]  know energy board saying it would double power prices over the next five years we're now four
[46:40.720 --> 46:46.480]  years later and austin's power prices have roughly doubled and it's just destroying the economy
[46:47.760 --> 46:51.760]  clean burning coal folks nothing comes out of those things but carbon dioxide and water vapor
[46:51.760 --> 46:56.400]  so they've listed carbon dioxide as a pollutant meanwhile we'll end up getting our power they'll
[46:56.400 --> 47:01.520]  just build dirty plants in mexico or dirty plants in china they're all building dirty plants mexico
[47:01.520 --> 47:06.880]  builds a new one every week china three every week we get more than 15 shut down it used to be just
[47:06.880 --> 47:12.560]  three every week now it's more than 15 coal power plants shut down a week and look all i'm saying is
[47:12.560 --> 47:18.480]  no one else has to be shut off but england and the u.s and germany and spain spain did this first
[47:18.480 --> 47:23.520]  and you can pull up mainstream articles admitting they're into depression because of it yeah you
[47:23.520 --> 47:29.280]  double or triple in the case of spain people's energy prices i mean they're turning the lights out
[47:29.840 --> 47:35.600]  and then all these people with their volt cars great you plug into coal power they're just shutting
[47:35.600 --> 47:40.240]  them down everywhere they're going to shut down austin's last power plant they've shut two that
[47:40.240 --> 47:46.160]  were sitting on down they've got the fayetteville that's of new design built 20 years ago but upgraded
[47:46.160 --> 47:51.840]  nothing comes out of the carbon the oxide and water vapor it's about 80 miles away from austin
[47:52.880 --> 47:59.200]  you can type in fayetteville texas power plant and see it and they are the city of austin owns a
[47:59.200 --> 48:06.160]  third of it with houston and is trying to force the shutdown of it the shutdown of an incredible
[48:06.160 --> 48:12.480]  asset again i tell the story about this my grandfather's one of them was a fighter pilot the other
[48:12.480 --> 48:17.280]  flew bombers but the issue was they were blowing up german power plants blowing up german
[48:18.240 --> 48:23.120]  my dad said you know bombing railways bombing infrastructure bombing factories
[48:25.120 --> 48:28.000]  this is the equivalent of america being bombed
[48:31.600 --> 48:36.880]  or godzilla coming out of the ocean godzilla is coming out this week my buddy shane steiner
[48:36.880 --> 48:47.040]  calls it uh pacific rim two or is it advice versa pacific rim has got zilla too but the point is
[48:49.120 --> 48:52.880]  the business groups in here and and and same with the texas government point out
[48:52.880 --> 48:59.600]  it will shut the economy off but that's the plan the total shutoff some people are like
[48:59.600 --> 49:04.320]  well i don't own coal stocks or i don't care well i don't either folks in fact my family's
[49:04.320 --> 49:09.200]  got a few little gas wells that are in competition against oil and coal so if i was just greedy
[49:09.200 --> 49:14.320]  wanting my daddy a little bit more money for his gas wells i would be good shut off the shut off the
[49:14.320 --> 49:20.640]  coal because you can run natural gas in these power plants and it's even cleaner than coal but
[49:20.640 --> 49:24.800]  still carbon dioxide does come off of it and they're saying they'll bankrupt those now too well
[49:24.800 --> 49:29.520]  we're gonna get the power people say well i'll excuse me for free energy i am for new forms of
[49:29.520 --> 49:35.920]  energy they're not letting it get deployed or developed so we better use the petroleum resources
[49:35.920 --> 49:42.000]  we've got now some big energy side i saw it last week attack me whenever i had uh
[49:43.040 --> 49:48.480]  quarter stansbury on about his uh energy boom that's one part of his conference that's just
[49:49.200 --> 49:54.000]  like a third of the presentations there with debone pickens well shouldn't we get it from
[49:54.000 --> 49:58.800]  texas rather than saudi arabia i mean this is what we've got now so yes i wanted to
[49:58.800 --> 50:02.720]  can't you hold two thoughts in your mind at the same time i want to develop new systems you
[50:03.840 --> 50:09.520]  and then we need to also exploit what we've got and keep prices down or there goes our way of
[50:09.520 --> 50:14.400]  life and you can argue well we have too good a way of life okay but here's the deal the globalists
[50:14.400 --> 50:18.720]  are exempting themselves and they want to make us poor for political control and people are on the
[50:18.720 --> 50:24.640]  edge of bankruptcy all over this country and it's not fair that china and india and mexico and 100
[50:24.640 --> 50:30.720]  plus other countries 160 plus other countries are exempt all our jobs will go there if they aren't
[50:30.720 --> 50:39.520]  already gone don't you understand that i mean your trendiness will not save you court rules cold
[50:39.520 --> 50:44.800]  rules will devastate say business groups environmental protection agency carbon dioxide limits for
[50:44.800 --> 50:50.800]  new power plants will devastate the economy by leading to steep surge in energy prices the coal
[50:50.800 --> 50:56.400]  industry and its allies warned well it's an absolute fact i mean the prices are already
[50:56.400 --> 51:03.120]  exploding and that's out of the hill newspaper stay with us so my elementary school aged child
[51:03.120 --> 51:08.320]  is begging me for a cell phone please mom please all the kids have them but i've seen the research

[54:22.880 --> 54:29.040]  and a man that runs one of the largest most successful school safety training organizations
[54:29.040 --> 54:33.920]  he says it's staged sandy hook and i know it's staged i've seen Anderson Cooper with weird
[54:33.920 --> 54:38.320]  blue screen green screen stuff claiming he was there i just don't know exactly what they staged
[54:39.040 --> 54:44.240]  you know the official stories of fraud but then when a top expert like this guy starts
[54:44.240 --> 54:48.960]  investigating it he's been threatened by the fbi at his house now barred from being able to ask
[54:48.960 --> 54:53.280]  questions at school board i mean they are really and you could see him with the kids going in
[54:53.280 --> 54:59.440]  circles the same kids going in and out on helicopter shot in a staged event looks like a drill
[54:59.440 --> 55:05.200]  they might have killed a few real kids in there i don't know but we know they were having a drill
[55:05.200 --> 55:10.640]  we know they had weird swat teams dressed up like the shooters there uh government connections to
[55:10.640 --> 55:18.160]  the kid i mean it's it's the same deal the colorado shooter ladies and gentlemen on record was under
[55:18.160 --> 55:23.200]  a top military psychiatrist i don't even have time to get into it it's coming up i mean it's
[55:23.200 --> 55:28.480]  staged it's staged and and they're doing this to come after our guns but let's get to a really
[55:28.480 --> 55:33.680]  serious report you can see the video up on info wars dot com if you're a radio listener cops attack
[55:33.680 --> 55:39.680]  family with tasers and pepper spray for having party in their own home and now they're sending
[55:39.680 --> 55:45.840]  swat teams for anything now sometimes they send swat teams for unpaid uh you know speeding tickets
[55:45.840 --> 55:50.880]  it's just the police are converting over to this and it's sickening and it's very dangerous and the
[55:50.880 --> 55:55.520]  houston police they're policing a few years ago called for cameras and all citizens homes
[55:55.520 --> 56:01.040]  watched by the police i mean this guy needs to move the old soviet union north korea uh here it is
[56:02.080 --> 56:06.880]  tonight police in baytown are giving their side of the story after a family accused them of using
[56:06.880 --> 56:12.320]  excessive force last night we showed you this videotape released by the family who says the
[56:12.320 --> 56:17.600]  officers were violent with them and even repeatedly tased a grandmother seven members of that family
[56:17.600 --> 56:22.480]  are facing charges tonight and police are telling local to his full archer they believe it was their
[56:22.480 --> 56:30.640]  officers who were really in danger according to baytown police it began when officers interrupted
[56:30.640 --> 56:36.720]  a party in jose zepeda's backyard they said they tried to arrest him after he refused to sign a ticket
[56:36.720 --> 56:43.600]  for disturbing the peace but then they say three party goers redolfo zepeda edgar garcia and christian
[56:43.600 --> 56:49.040]  zepeda tried to stop them from that point on the three gentlemen started pushing the officers
[56:49.040 --> 56:54.080]  assaulting the officers so therefore when the officers pulled out pepper spray and sprayed one
[56:54.080 --> 56:59.600]  time the officers followed two of them in into the house and alleged family member locked the door
[56:59.600 --> 57:05.680]  behind them outnumbered ten to one detective edgar elizondo says the policeman called for help
[57:05.680 --> 57:10.000]  you know you basically have a couple of officers inside the residence trap fighting with people
[57:10.000 --> 57:17.920]  so therefore we had no other choice during the melee the zepeda family contains officers pepper
[57:17.920 --> 57:23.360]  sprayed small children the department flatly denies it saying the children may have been affected by
[57:23.360 --> 57:31.200]  the spray on the men's clothes i mean you can see it three adults were shot with tasers
[57:34.160 --> 57:40.800]  including 53-year-old maria zepeda but police say she was tasered once and she tried to prevent
[57:40.800 --> 57:46.320]  them from arresting her son they were calling us wet bags and party goers alleged the video proves
[57:46.320 --> 57:52.480]  police used racial slurs as they arrested a total of seven suspects the department says the video
[57:52.480 --> 57:57.680]  actually shows something else and we slowed it down a little bit and you can hear the officers
[57:57.680 --> 58:03.280]  plainly saying get back get back uh there's no racist remarks made in the week since it happened
[58:03.280 --> 58:06.160]  i don't know if i believe that because it looks like most of those cops are hispanics they're
[58:06.160 --> 58:10.640]  going to be calling i mean the whole point is though why is there a bunch of cops showing up at
[58:10.640 --> 58:14.720]  a party to begin with you can see on the video they're tasering an old woman on the ground
[58:14.720 --> 58:18.960]  they're they're they're definitely attacking everybody in the building in the video you see
[58:20.000 --> 58:25.520]  i mean they are the people are not resisting them in the video i've seen but i just want to
[58:25.520 --> 58:32.400]  know why the police taser people for you know not asking questions or arguing or whatever uh
[58:33.760 --> 58:38.640]  tasers also cause heart attacks that's been proven will be right back with the second hour
[58:38.640 --> 58:46.800]  thank you for listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com today

[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:21.760]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:27.680]  coming up leon macadoo went on the streets of austin and said should the word fiesta be banned
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:32.560]  should all mexican food be banned universities are banning it everywhere having mexican fiesta
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:39.200]  parties and tacos saying it's racist i just thought it was a theme of a party like you have a hawaiian
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:45.840]  luau party it's not because you hate hawaiians it's because it sounds fun and you go out and get
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:50.560]  all the little tiki torches and a little hawaiian stuff to put on the drinks and the little pool
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:57.760]  parties is that against i think we should ban it because if one person is offended that universities
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:03.760]  are having a fiesta party so we should ban fiesta food stores that are across the southwest
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:10.480]  we should ban fiesta texas that's obviously racist the word party is racist this is 1984
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:14.880]  where they're reducing the language down and i see people on info wars dot com commenting this
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:20.400]  going look at these dumb liberals a they're not liberals they're authoritarian fascists control
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:30.800]  freaks want to control language and b they are just right in 1984 reducing everything down
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:36.960]  or you can't even communicate with anybody and and everything is a political faux pas
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:42.640]  so that you are just in a catatonic state of inaction unable to do anything thinking it's
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:49.680]  offensive and i've told the stories of of hearing people sometimes says hey let's get chinese food
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:56.480]  everybody's like shh at first it's you know you don't call it the orient you call it asia you don't
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:01.760]  call it asia you call it the east you know you don't you don't say african-american now
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:08.800]  you say this it's just all how do i please you well you turn your guns in you pay more taxes
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:14.000]  to warren buffett that's how you prove you're not racist and you give money to plan parenthood
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:21.280]  to abort the minority babies to prove you're not racist good and you know you also are a
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:27.440]  nazi collaborator like george soros the famous one and then you get awards from the adl if
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:32.320]  but if you fight the nazis the adl will list you okay and the government will send white
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:36.560]  supremacist that are government-controlled after you have your alex jones and then the southern
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:41.200]  probably law center will imply you're a racist while they send the white supremacist after you
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:45.360]  are proven to be government agents and arles watson agar will dress up a nazi offense and
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:49.920]  wear death's head belts nazi belts and say that he loves hitler to rolling stone magazine and
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:59.200]  wants to be a dictator and he'll get adl awards but but if you make a movie about christ and make
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:08.160]  one comment you're baited into about jews you'll be crucified that's all political correctness is
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:13.040]  ladies and gentlemen is a weapon to control people and to end speech and to shut down the
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:18.160]  society so that piece is coming up leon macadoon another report i think i'm gonna have time to air

[01:03:54.960 --> 01:04:02.640]  important article from the financial times of london and and and that's even more important
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.640]  than the wall street journal in my opinion this is a real elitist publication that openly calls
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:13.840]  for world government but in this they say hedge fund titans are testing the quality of us democracy
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:19.680]  policy if branches of government bout a big business public policy will be decided by the
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:28.000]  highest bidder well that's the plan more money more bribes bigger bribes more bribes and bigger
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.520]  bribes and then it just goes on to break down how it's a revolving door with the big hedge funds
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:38.400]  the hedge fund hyenas and the big investment banks literally just overthrowing the entire
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:43.840]  us government well they've done that in the england as well that's why the billionaires or record
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:48.560]  levels are moving to london because you can go there and incorporate and pay almost no taxes
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:53.600]  but the average brit pays some of the highest taxes in the world not compared to france but they're

[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:10.880]  big push against guns the next 24 hours very suspicious then you've got the local regional
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:16.320]  swat team people hiding out in the woods in the same outfits as the supposed shooter you've got
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:21.200]  the whole story changing the most incriminating is you got the helicopter footage of the of the
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:26.480]  people uh you know with their hands up coming out of the school in in the in the evacuation
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:32.640]  hours after it supposedly happened going in circles in and out of the school going in circles
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:39.840]  they've torn down the school now they've declared state secrets on the photos the video there's
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:44.400]  weird anderson cooper video where he claims he's there on the ground at the town square and he
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:51.200]  turns bigger than dallas and it's a green screen he's shimmering around the edges his nose disappears
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:56.000]  you can see flowers and things blowing in the wind and then they do it again
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:03.200]  it's the same footage being looped behind them uh i mean i don't know what happened there
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:08.160]  but i know anderson cooper's admittedly a member of the central intelligence agency
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:14.320]  and they send him out on the dis info pieces he's been caught three times the last couple years
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:21.440]  with fake massacre videos on cnn from syria fake shootings where they'll have the feed going
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:28.000]  now i shoot now i stage it dragging dead bodies around this is the stuff they do so
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:32.960]  we know they've been caught running false flags the turkish government's been caught staging
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:39.120]  attacks against itself that's bbc run by the same globalist so this is important well

[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:15.600]  bet he's lost a lot of business with the system but he doesn't care i'm guessing that's i i know
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:19.200]  how the system works i don't know that i'll ask him out in a minute but he's the exact type of
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:25.520]  expert witness you want who goes against his own interest monetarily to go out and tell the truth
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:32.480]  now here's the bombshell news this is in discovery dot com newtown school board shuts down conspiracy

[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:31.440]  skeptic of known liars but in a world of universal deception and universal lies telling the truth is
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:38.240]  the revolutionary act to quote george arwell aka george arwell eric blair so here's the headline
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:44.000]  school board shuts down conspiracy theorists now they've shot footage of this and wolfgang's making
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.160]  a documentary but he said he'll send us the raw footage as soon as it gets here make copies on
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:53.040]  memory stick or whatever we will get a special report out because this needs to be seen of them
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:57.120]  being shut down at the school board then trying to go to united way and others
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:02.320]  that famously suck up the oklahoma city money the 911 money for themselves give it to anti gun
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:08.720]  groups that's how this whole scam works united way red cross i mean they're just vicious organizations
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:13.120]  a lot of good people work for them and do good work but back when i first covered this like 15
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:17.920]  years ago and then nobody believed me they're well known scamsters basically a democratic party
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:24.080]  operations but the bottom line here is that then the police blocked him from going in a public
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:30.240]  building that by law he's supposed to be allowed into so wolfgang joins us to cover what's happened
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:36.080]  to him currently and now he's being blocked from investigating he's been visited repeatedly by a
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:42.720]  quote law enforcement telling me better back off they're acting scared to death folks okay they're
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:49.200]  acting scared to death about this big production they put on there and the good news is the majority
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:54.160]  of people i see across the board and i meet do not believe any of this stuff anymore now we'll get
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:15:00.320]  back into after he recaps what just happened we will get back into his biggest questions concerning
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:07.440]  it but wolfgang thanks for coming on back alex i really appreciate it well thank you i appreciate
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:13.440]  you coming on go ahead well you know i really wish you could have gone on this trip and i think
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:20.000]  it's important that every listener clearly understands that do i want to be doing this
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:26.400]  absolutely not i'm retired i mean i got my a p card had these police officers had the homicide
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:32.320]  investigators not come to my home a week before christmas new town would have never heard of
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:37.840]  wolfgang how big nobody would have ever heard of me because you know as a national school safety
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:45.200]  consultant i simply was sending the foyer request connecticut freedom of information request asking
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:50.960]  simple questions that's not offensive to any of those parents who supposedly lost a child
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:58.080]  not offensive to danbury police or the connecticut state police and to this day they don't return
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:04.880]  phone calls they refuse to respond to any any connecticut freedom of information act and when
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:09.840]  we're at the school board you know i had three minutes i had a chance to talk to him and i said
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:15.200]  you know chairman you talk about honesty that everybody's supposed to be honest here in this
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:21.600]  room where's the honesty why don't you return phone calls why can't you respond to simple
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:28.720]  foyer request i mean you're an educational institution you're supposed to know how to communicate
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:36.880]  and what really was important is that in march alex in march the freedom of information commission
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:44.160]  out of heart for connecticut actually send an instructor to new town to sandy hook that teach
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:51.520]  them on how to respond to foyer request that they cannot ignore them that if they are publicly
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:57.280]  documents they need to be presented i mean they actually had somebody there before i got there
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:03.600]  that teach them how to do it and what they must do and guess what they're in defiance of him
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:06.240]  they're not even listening to their own freedom commissioner
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:14.480]  unbelievable it is unbelievable and and and we actually aired a few nights ago uh on the info
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:19.680]  works nightly news the video of that transpiring you're going to send us the video of going to
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:23.760]  the united way and being blocked which you were telling us is illegal we're going to get to that
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:28.400]  in a moment but we do have that video and that special report we will play your three minutes
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:34.880]  coming up but why do you think they're acting so desperate uh to uh block you and and tell
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:39.760]  folks what happened at the united way well i think the reason they're not answering those
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:46.000]  questions because i think it's going to expose their whole scam i mean the questions you know
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:51.280]  they come from my background as a law enforcement officer and customs agent i think you need to
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:56.800]  know when you have a security system you should know who installed the security system how much
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:02.960]  did you pay for it what did you put in i mean you ought to have emails between the principal
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:08.480]  and the school district talking about work orders talking about finance transportation
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:13.200]  i mean it actually will tell you whether this there's no history there's no history there's no
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:18.640]  nothing yeah there's they don't want to respond see that's the whole thing when you don't respond
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:26.400]  it raises the red flag and this has been going on for 11 months and they don't even return a phone
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:34.000]  call me as a principal alex i may not like you as a parent but if you call me i have a responsibility
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:42.400]  i've got to call you back this district they just do whatever they want very suspicious and when we
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:49.600]  come back i want you to recap for folks as an investigator and as a school safety expert who's
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:57.440]  again been been sourced and used on cbs news you name it a leading national expert you know coming

[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:14.320]  this thing is staged well it starts at the united way western connecticut if there's one thing we
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:20.560]  learned about people in america is always follow the money and i think when you look at the amount
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:27.360]  of money that has been poured in the sandy hook in newtown because of this incident it all starts
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:34.080]  at the united way western connecticut who actually i mean you saw it advertised three days before the
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:39.840]  shooting they were looking to solicit money three days before the shooting and i think the big red
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:45.760]  flag is the connecticut attorney general's report on his findings we're gonna talk about that wolf
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:51.520]  king stay there yeah and and bloomberg this is in the news he false started today before as well

[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:23.840]  of the weird anomalies and just the clear fraud here and now the massive cover up
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:31.520]  so break down sir just to a lay person out there the smoking guns of this and why you

[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.440]  what really caught my attention was the letters that were drafted that were actually written
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:55.680]  to two nonprofits called the united way western connecticut and the sandy hook promise fund which
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:25:02.480]  is a pass through from the united way western connecticut and the connecticut attorney general's
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:08.720]  name is george jespen i mean i'm looking at his letter and he really really told them that you
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:15.520]  know as to do she varies that they are reputable to the public and they must be transparent in
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:23.200]  every way since they're soliciting and they're recruiting funds from major corporations that
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:31.360]  they must be open transparent and also he made a big note that if they are selected if they are
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:37.840]  soliciting money under false pretenses that they need to be very very careful i understand we'll
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:42.560]  get into all the minutiae of an investigator trying to get in but why are you saying united way is so
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:46.880]  important i mean what are the big smoking guns because i know you're inside this investigation
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:52.240]  but for folks out there what are the red flags well the red flag is that you're looking at 29
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:59.120]  million dollars you got the united way sandy hook promise and there are 39 other community
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:06.720]  nonprofit organizations within newtown which received a lot of funds for an example the animal
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:14.080]  shelter in newtown sandy hook alex they got 450 thousand dollars from the sandy hook shooting
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:18.480]  now what does an animal shelter have to do with this understand you're saying the motive for the
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:24.560]  locals to go along with the fraud is money i get that i'm talking about the the crime scene itself
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:33.280]  recap that well the crime scene itself is you know it's just it's not the way we in law enforcement
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:41.040]  respond to any type of a shots fired or 911 calls it just does not make sense and i go back to the
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:46.880]  very beginning any listener i think the only way i think your listeners will understand whether
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:53.040]  their grandparents parents guardians you have to actually ask to close your eyes and pretend that
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:27:00.320]  you had a child it's saying you hooked that morning on december 14th 2012 you really have to pretend
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:06.000]  that you heard on the news their shots fired and all of a sudden your heart starts racing and you
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:11.600]  get to that school and all of a sudden you know that somebody says oh i think your little girl a
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:16.160]  little boy was shot they might be seriously injured and then you all of a sudden learn
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:22.640]  that nobody somebody at that school did not bother to even order the trauma helicopters i mean that
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:28.640]  is unheard of i don't care where you go in this country or around the world you get the medical
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:34.640]  help you get the best any air as quick as bottom line there was a stand down and that and you've
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:38.560]  you've blueprinted all that out on your website but i saw it happen what about the kids going in
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:43.520]  circles back and forth the same people into the school for the helicopters it looked like a fake
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:47.680]  drill what about the guy in the woods that got picked up in the same outfit it was part of the
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:53.360]  anti-terror team uh what about i mean just go through those points well yeah okay i'm glad you
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:59.360]  were right i mean i'm trying to stay focused just on the kids and not having trauma helicopters and
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:04.560]  i cannot believe they didn't let paramedics or amts in but you talk about the people they
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:09.520]  actually caught in the woods and you can hear the words even in the police recordings they've
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:16.400]  got him pruned out alex they got him handcuffed one of the people actually is carrying a firearm
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:21.680]  he's got a firearm that they caught in the woods but do you think they would have run his name
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:28.000]  to the computer database do you think they would have run a 1028 1029 check him through the ncic
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:34.160]  computers to see if there is any outstanding warrants alex we don't even see their names every
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:40.960]  person that was apprehended handcuffed taken in the police the cover-up is the prima facia proof of
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:47.680]  the larger crime and that we're being lied to absolutely i you know what i don't see it you
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:52.480]  know i wanted to say that at the board meeting that if you go home tonight you turn those lights

[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:30.080]  alex jones and the gcm radio network you know people can make fun of dan badandi because he's
[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:35.440]  just a real guy and has a heavy east coast accent but i really admire dan badandi our reporter
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:40.720]  on the east coast because he's the guy that went up during the boston bombing that was a total
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:48.320]  drill on record with the older brother tamerlan being a cia asset on record i mean it was in
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:57.760]  major british and german news two years before and then after the bombing that that the russians
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:04.720]  had blown a bunch of spies covers by going to the us consulates and giving them a list of names his
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:12.000]  name among them saying hey this guy's allowed to fly with a fake name he works for you huh they were
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:20.400]  sending him out of georgetown there is a big new brzezinski group cia funded on record over to
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:26.160]  chechnya to literally work with the extremist groups now does that mean he was infiltrating
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:30.000]  him to spy on al-qaeda does that mean he was part of it we don't know the guy
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:36.320]  did he get turned and then actually came back and did a real bombing we don't know
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:44.240]  the point is is that that went on that should be a big news issue now you see the drill you see
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:50.960]  the stand down you see all the people on the ground it looks like craft international wearing craft hats
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:58.720]  and then that all gets shut down and the head of craft gets killed at a shooting range
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:07.440]  chris kyle i mean by the way a lot of our guests get killed
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:13.760]  over the years quite a few of them have died dc madem melisco's pretty long
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:19.120]  the deputy head of emergency management berry jennings in new york
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:25.280]  two weeks after he's on this show dead probably a witness protection program the neighbors said
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:29.600]  that all these trucks pulled up the family moved out he disappeared probably not dead
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:33.920]  that should be investigated we try to talk to the family that wouldn't they wouldn't talk to us
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:41.840]  so what i'm getting at here with everybody is this is not a game okay we know they staged
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:47.920]  stuff they staged it before and we know they were set and ready with that tragedy and again you
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:52.000]  look at the aurora shooting that was totally staged i don't have an hour to go over the
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:57.360]  evidence most of you are aware of it all but it was incredible how staged that was he was just
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:03.280]  the drugged up patsy for whoever the real shooter was i mean folks they could grab me drug me up
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:08.000]  with amnesia put me in a car go and shoot a movie theater and have the cops find me in the car
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:13.280]  i mean i mean it's really that easy and and uh they could do it to you they could do it to
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:17.360]  anybody but in his case he was under the psychiatric care of a top air force psych warfare
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:23.600]  expert who formerly ran an entire base in san antonio and who was sent to that university
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:30.160]  to work with uh the shooter there whose dad was one of the top algorithm scientists in the country
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:33.520]  and he was an algorithm scientist the reported shooter
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:43.760]  in a secret DARPA mind control program that's mainstream news of human machine brain interface
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:50.240]  and they get and and and that was theodore kasinski la times alexander cockburn broke
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:37:00.080]  that did the foyer and got it he was cia the unabomber was cia james holmes worked above
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:06.640]  cia in a super black DARPA program super black everything was paid for
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:12.720]  when they counted it all up he was getting like 80 g's a year and government money we know of
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:19.040]  80 g's and notice that the cops shut that thing down when not anybody in there claiming there
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:20.320]  were bombs in their bowl
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:30.880]  theodore kasinski was in the mk ultra mind control program that's la times that's admitted
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:34.400]  yeah it sounds sensational reality is sensational
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:42.320]  these are real mind control victims but usually they just have a drugged up nut
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:45.600]  who takes the fall they're not even the real shooter like surhan surhan
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:53.840]  the la pd police report said none of his bullets hit rfk and it was another caliber in the back
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:38:00.480]  he starts getting ready to shoot they they pin his arm doesn't matter people behind him boom
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:04.640]  boom and he'd been drugged with an amnesiac surhan surhan
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:13.120]  and then there's famous photos in the ballroom before he gets killed of three famous cia agents
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:20.560]  one of them a section chief over latin america in the ballroom they don't even hide this stuff
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:26.640]  ladies and gentlemen anderson cooper cia up there who cares if it's blue screen just like cnn i'm
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:31.680]  going back to our guest just like cnn back during the first Gulf War was at the broadcast center in
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:37.920]  Atlanta on top of roof with a blue screen behind them saying they were in riyadh saudi arabia and
[01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:46.480]  israel different days being hit by nerve gas and then they went on air for parts of it with the
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:55.360]  blue screen not even turned on with blue behind them and then there were live feeds back in that day
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:58.800]  remember the whole thing where david letterman was getting mad that people could tape his show
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:03.760]  as it was being taped and sent over say the thing with jay leno same thing was happening with johnny
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:06.880]  carcifer he retired because they would tape it during the day and then beam it back to new york
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:12.960]  to be edited well it's the same deal cnn was sending that raw feeds out all over the world
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:17.920]  and people knew how to de scramble them and get them and it's on record that cnn did fake
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:27.600]  a stud missile attack videos so they've done it over and over again we've got wolfgang here
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:31.360]  with us sir i'm going to give you about three minutes to make any other points that you didn't
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:37.600]  make to the school board then we're going to play a special report uh that aired actually last friday
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:41.600]  of you in there talking to him uh i didn't know the video was actually out or had been on the
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:46.160]  nightly news i miss friday show i usually watch it uh almost every night but i but i missed that
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:54.800]  when i was with family but uh look let's say you got three minutes in a nutshell of of of what's
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:40:01.760]  going on here to the lay person out there as a school safety expert renowned nationally uh
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:06.240]  mr halbig of what really happened here and then what would you say to that school board
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:13.120]  well the first thing i gotta say before i get into that is that thank god i've had 67 great
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:18.960]  years of great life i got a beautiful family you know i mean i'm getting threats all the time i
[01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:24.240]  got some crazy people out there you know they're attacking my wife they're attacking me and everything
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:30.000]  else but you know what all they have to do is answer 16 simple questions you and i wouldn't
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:35.840]  even be talking today it's just it's unheard of okay and i think i think the school board members
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:42.000]  and the superintendent they have a responsibility of telling the truth alex there's no i cannot
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:49.680]  believe that a public school system and you know when you look at the school itself when you look at
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:58.160]  sandy hook it is a filthy school that's what i wanted to talk to the board members about it is a toxic
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:03.840]  waste dump when you look at the data and here's what they didn't realize they put it in their own
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:10.080]  newspaper before they demolished it sandy hook had the highest level of lead pain throughout the
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:16.960]  entire school sandy hook had the highest highest level of asbestos in the ceiling tiles and ceiling
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:24.480]  floors it had the highest level of pcp in the groundwater is contaminated now here's the question
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:32.240]  connecticut law requires that every parent must be notified of those hazardous chemicals because
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:38.880]  they have serious health effects on children which may not be seen five until five years later now
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:46.080]  why would any parent why would those 18 of the 20 parents that moved into newtown in 2009
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:51.440]  enroll their child in the school with all those hazardous chemical their parents just don't do
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:57.520]  that they don't expose their little children to chemical hazards let me just stop you as an
[01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:03.120]  investigator comment they got al capone for tax evasion not for all the murders or money laundering
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:07.760]  you're looking at how they don't do any of the standard stuff the paperwork the police reports
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:13.200]  no helicopters sent no rescue kids going in circles totally staged men with guns in the
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:18.320]  woods getting grabbed no names released they deny it went on later have to admit it went on but say
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:24.800]  we're not answering questions i mean clearly it's a drill just like the boston bombing i don't know
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:30.880]  exactly what's going on but it just the official story isn't true and again i've read a lot of
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:35.600]  criminology i'm not you know i'm not a cop but i've studied a lot of it and just from an
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:41.760]  lay media investigative journalist perspective something is rotten here and then you see it
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:47.440]  duplicated over and over again what's your bottom line what do you think really happened at sandy
[01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:53.760]  hook people can see your 16 questions at sandy hook justice dot com and we just salute your uh
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:58.400]  your will to go up there and have eight police cars block you tonight away and have them shut you
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:05.520]  down at the at the school board uh at the commission but but but bottom line what do you as a as a
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:11.280]  almost 40 year you know investigator police officer you name it what do you think's happening here
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:18.640]  well until they answer those questions i can tell you children did not die teachers did not die on
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:26.800]  december 14th 2012 it just could not have happened and it's in their words it's not about wolfgang
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:35.040]  things or it's just my opinion it's what they say i mean their own words actually show that it could
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:43.440]  not have happened who declares 27 people legally dead within eight minutes nobody does that who has
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:52.800]  a 99.9 kill rate uh shooting children in a school within eight minutes there isn't an FBI agent
[01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:59.360]  there isn't a navy seal that's that good of a shot within eight minutes and then kill himself i mean
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:05.920]  that's reasonable doubt i mean that in itself is reasonable doubt to show that adam landser
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:14.880]  could not have done that i mean he's an autistic child he's got aspers alex nobody has a 99.9
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:19.760]  kill rate not even the new york police but he's a perfect cutout and for those that don't know
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:25.200]  the reason that is even if you're shooting people point blank in the head the bullets change direction
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:30.160]  they go different directions and i mean a lot of times i've shot a wild hog a deer you name it and
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:35.200]  the bullet deflects off even if you hit them broadside sometimes it just deflects through
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:43.440]  you don't get 99.99 kill rates it's it's just incredibly hard to do it is and the thing that
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:49.760]  people they haven't had time to read that 7 000 page report that was put out by steven sedenski
[01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:57.680]  who's the state attorney in danbury connecticut even the governor's own commission alex the governor's
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:06.240]  own handpicked sandy hook advisory commission calls this 7 000 page report the biggest data dump
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:14.960]  that they've ever seen now this is his handpicked commission and it's redacted this is a commission
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:21.120]  supposed to read it study it and come up with recommendations and they get a redacted report
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:26.720]  now what does that tell us well everybody's compartmentalized and everybody's just playing
[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:32.880]  along with the peer pressure just like the police officers on 9 11 you know we're told get back they're
[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:38.480]  going to blow up building 7 it's on video i heard it on cnn heard it on cbs news have the video the
[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:43.520]  cop saying get back they're blowing it up i'm not saying the cops blew it up i've interviewed the
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:49.520]  police officers on this show that are on cnn saying get back they're going to blow it up i
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:54.080]  think and they said no we were told the radio they're going to blow up building 7 get back
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:46:01.200]  and there was a countdown on the the the red cross radio they were running it and again they use
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:07.520]  united way red cross as the cia cutouts if you look that up that's mainstream news and they were
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:13.600]  there telling the cops what to do that afternoon incredible and they're there hearing the countdown
[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:21.040]  i've interviewed not one but two one of them was a um t the other a cop and boy did they get
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:24.240]  threatened over it they wouldn't even do more interviews after it and they don't know we heard
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:29.280]  the countdown and the red cross guy said you know morally i i just tell you cops get back
[01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:32.800]  they're going to blow it up in a couple minutes because i'm not supposed to tell you this just
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:37.440]  and then the countdown and the cops will like countdown so the cops will like get back get back
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:42.240]  and then the media spends it you're saying the cops blew up the world trade centers and no all i
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:47.120]  know is it's on cnn cops going get back they're going to blow that building up they weren't even
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:52.640]  brought in on it they got told by people warning them who were compartmentalized and it's just so
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:57.360]  incredible i don't mean to get off into another subject wolfgang it's just that i've seen this
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:02.960]  over and over again how the compartmentalization works i agree but i think the same alice we've
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:10.160]  never had a time in our history where sandy hook the school massacre the biggest illusion ever
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:17.440]  portrayed by homeland security and female it can bring down the house i think america i cannot
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:24.560]  tell america this is this is probably our only chance to unite and come together and look for
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:30.480]  the truth and this house needs to fall because sandy hook is taking away our guns across the
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:36.720]  country sandy hook is messing with our freedom of speech that's not the america that we you and i
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:43.440]  know alex and they raise hundreds of millions of dollars billions in the case of 911 collecting
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:48.960]  money off of people's goodwill and then giving it to anti-gun groups the united way is an anti-gun
[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:56.800]  cesspit it is and i hope nobody ever donates another dime to unite away until they answer every
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:01.120]  question well i mean there's already been so many scandals about united way i mean
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:07.680]  more than half the money goes to the executives i just saw that one i'll tell you a good charity
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:14.880]  is the salvation army are they involved in anyway locally up there are you ready salvation army is
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:21.040]  not even one of the 39 nonprofits listed you know why because they're a good organization
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:28.480]  that she just mentioned they're not involved that's right it's always the same players it's the same
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:34.400]  players and you know when you have eight police officers i mean forcibly stopping me from just
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:40.080]  going in with an attorney and when they have in their hand the iris regular regulations
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:44.640]  something is serious by the way that was really a false detainment or false arrest that's a civil
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:50.720]  rights violation well we're working on that but you know what here's the one that really got me
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:56.560]  you have no right to be on their property alex i want you to listen to the police officers captain
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:02.160]  you have no right to be on their property it's public you can only be here if they invite you
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:06.400]  now tell me if there's something wrong with that one yeah when you're a public open charity that
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:11.120]  operates and says that they're an open operation under the state and federal bylaws they're supposed
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:15.920]  to let people in to examine things absolutely and you don't have to make an appointment he says well
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:20.720]  you don't have an appointment i said where does this say in the iris regulations that i have to
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:25.440]  have an appointment well how are they waiting for you to get there that's another thing yeah they

[02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:29.600]  you know latimer putin gets criticized a lot for taking small pieces of some of the big
[02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:36.640]  energy companies that were rusted away from western oligarchs that were controlling russia
[02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:42.880]  and undoubtedly some of that goes on again i'm no fan of russian corruption
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:53.360]  but joe biden's son in this curt nimo article and it's in a press release put out by the company
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:01:01.680]  that he heads up curt nimo's article as the headline joe biden's son appointed the board

[02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:10.800]  expanding making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive all the major networks
[02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:16.400]  are state-run we are partnering this year with the nfl the nfl has become a political weapon
[02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:22.080]  against the second amendment pushes obama care ns nbc tells us that our children belong to the state
[02:07:22.080 --> 02:07:26.560]  we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids
[02:07:26.560 --> 02:07:30.560]  belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities it is more important
[02:07:30.560 --> 02:07:36.560]  than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media we are the true media the establishment

[02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:20.240]  you are listening to an infowars dot com front line report if you are receiving this transmission
[02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:30.240]  you are the resistance
[02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:38.560]  well i always like getting him on the show he's a really great researcher and filmmaker joel
[02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:43.520]  gilbert he made dreams of my real father exposing who i believe obama's real father is
[02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:49.040]  it was born in hawaii folks not kenya that's why he put in his harvard journal that he published
[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:53.360]  uh the the harvard law review that he was born in kenya his wife and all those speeches said he
[02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:58.240]  was born in kenya so they put out fake birth certificates that were so easily proven as fakes
[02:08:58.240 --> 02:09:03.920]  was to make you believe he was born in kenya so that you wouldn't understand who his dad
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:09.440]  really was we sell that film on dvd at info war store dot com and your purchases help support
[02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:16.640]  the broadcast but regardless joel gilbert joins us he's got a new film coming out uh that uh i hope
[02:09:16.640 --> 02:09:22.080]  to uh you'll be able to carry here and also show folks uh there's no place like utopia
[02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:26.320]  and the globalists say they're building a utopia is he's going to tell us about
[02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:30.320]  what he's been doing the last few years traveling the country and his his findings
[02:09:31.120 --> 02:09:37.600]  coming up here in just a few minutes uh in other news fridays uh cable ratings are out
[02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:43.440]  they come out a few days late seeing ends nine p.m. hour hits second lowest ratings in 15 years
[02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:50.160]  and uh wall street journals reporting tv ad dollars slowly shifting to web video
[02:09:50.720 --> 02:09:54.800]  increasing portion of broadcast and cable budgets follow younger audience online
[02:09:55.520 --> 02:09:58.720]  there's a lot of reasons for that you want to brand the younger audience but also you
[02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:05.840]  can skip ads on television you really can't skip ads on youtube if they're embedded that way
[02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:12.400]  and so this again is the the end of the dinosaur media if they don't shut down the real new media
[02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:17.040]  and that's why they're moving in trying to do that right now and that's why we're fighting to
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:23.680]  maintain true net neutrality and uh a open and free internet and what we bring on filmmakers
[02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:29.760]  like jill gilbert because if a film i may like obama deception can be seen conservatively
[02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:36.000]  50 to 60 million times for free online and even though i didn't agree with all of its content
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:42.080]  um the first zeitgeist was seen probably 50 60 million times or more and loose change that
[02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:49.840]  i produced downloaded over 200 million times now total uh you know it's it's a big effect uh and um
[02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:55.200]  it just shows the power of free speech and how those ideas
[02:10:55.200 --> 02:11:01.760]  bounce around forever i was in waking life back in 2001 richard link letter film and it had a
[02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:07.440]  three million dollar budget produced by tommy pilata and now is one of the most aired programs
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:14.240]  on cable and has been seen tens of millions of times and is now a hit movie it's a hit movie
[02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:22.240]  waking life is now a huge hit scanner darkly became a huge hit in dvd and on hbo not big in the
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:28.240]  theaters did okay 10 million dollar budget with keanu reeves myself and others i'm not name dropping
[02:11:28.240 --> 02:11:33.680]  the point is is that it shows the power of counterculture whether it real counterculture to the
[02:11:33.680 --> 02:11:38.880]  globalist kleptocratic synthetic culture of eugenics and death whether it's in an underground
[02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:45.440]  movie by rick link letter or whether it's in an internet video that you make in your home
[02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:53.360]  or whether it's you know cats fighting in your backyard uh whatever it is the power of the people
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:58.000]  and our expressions and our ideas that are off the reservation off the plantation of what will
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:03.520]  save society the system wants to put out memes force it get us to start repeating it and that's
[02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:10.080]  where propaganda has its real power is getting us to repeat the bull they put out but when we start
[02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:14.400]  ignoring it when we start not going along with it when we start saying no to it then it's over
[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:24.640]  and we're on the edge of a true renaissance here what do you say joel gilbert uh about the state
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:29.680]  of humanity another's a great awakening happening there's also a lot of people are awakening but
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:34.240]  then just kind of feeling powerless that were under this evil but then that only encourages
[02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:40.080]  people like joe biden's son to be given a membership on the board of the state-controlled
[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:46.720]  quasi-private uh national provider of gas in ukraine that also supplies much of europe
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:53.760]  and he's put they put joe biden's son over the company that gets the russian gas i mean why not
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:59.200]  just make obama the oligarch of ukraine i mean this is why not make joe biden the king of ukraine
[02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:03.040]  they could claim some genetic lineage and they could have a new emperor i mean how obvious
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:07.760]  does this have to get as they loot everything not knell down here as they shut down all their
[02:13:07.760 --> 02:13:14.400]  competition uh that they don't own here i mean this is a kleptocratic criminal takeover well we
[02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:22.880]  really have entered an era of reality and fantasy and unfortunately the fantasy of the progressives
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:29.440]  of the far left that goes back even before the sixties but these guys from the sixties seventies
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:36.720]  they decided that once they failed to destroy america and destroy the constitution with their
[02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:42.320]  communist revolution obama's pals like bill ares and those guys they said let's have a revolution
[02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:48.720]  to destroy the country we're going to get everybody to rise up by bombing some government
[02:13:48.720 --> 02:13:54.080]  buildings and murdering some policemen everybody's gonna rise up and take over the government it didn't
[02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:59.440]  work because it was evil nobody in their right mind would want to replace the constitution
[02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:04.480]  with the communist manifesto so these guys went underground and when they came back in the early
[02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:10.160]  eighties they decided let's take over the government from within instead of saying let's have a
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:16.880]  revolution to destroy america they simply say let's help middle-class families we want to help poor
[02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:23.040]  people but the agenda remains the same and they're coming with this utopian fantasy that we've seen
[02:14:23.040 --> 02:14:30.880]  over and over in history people followed mal Stalin pol Pot Castro they said go down the yellow brick
[02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:36.320]  road in the magical wizard is going to solve all your problems just like people follow obama
[02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:40.880]  he's this magical person but just like in the Wizard of Oz when you get there you find out
[02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:47.920]  he's a big phony he's a fraud and he sent Dorothy to the witches castle and she was taken prisoner
[02:14:47.920 --> 02:14:53.520]  so just like we know in history Stalin and Mao sent people to the gulags the collective farms
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:15:00.240]  and instead of utopia the fantasy blew up in their faces and they were led to death 100 million
[02:15:00.240 --> 02:15:10.000]  people died in peacetime from this utopian fantasy from utopians in power you know we've
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:15.680]  got a clip of the late former green beret larry graphwald who died earlier this year
[02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:22.000]  uh i guess of cancer but the point is is that he was in the highest levels of the of the weathermen
[02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:26.240]  and he was in the meetings where they said we're going to put 50 million conservatives and
[02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:31.840]  christians in camps and we're going to kill half of them yeah i knew larry uh i was very close to
[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:39.360]  him he's in my new film and he said to me look uh try to imagine sitting in a room with 50 people
[02:15:39.360 --> 02:15:47.200]  with phd's from columbia talking about how to eliminate 50 million americans if they don't
[02:15:47.200 --> 02:15:53.680]  go along with the progressive utopian fantasy and that's why progressivism is so dangerous
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:16:00.720]  the idea of paradise on earth with a human god who's Mao or Stalin or people that worship
[02:16:00.720 --> 02:16:06.560]  barack obama he's the perfect being he can't do anything wrong this mentality is very dangerous
[02:16:06.560 --> 02:16:12.000]  we've seen it in history again and again and i show in my film there's no place like utopia
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:17.120]  it's a play on obviously dorothy in the wizard of os there's no place like home that there's
[02:16:17.120 --> 02:16:23.600]  this magical fantasy progressives murdered 100 million people and by the way when i've been
[02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:28.080]  around so-called democrats out to dinner i don't mean your grassroots democrats who mean well and
[02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:32.240]  are really good people on average but real democratic operatives rob do was a dinner once
[02:16:32.240 --> 02:16:37.360]  with one of them we didn't even i mean i cut the guy out of a film it was so scary he said look
[02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:41.840]  when we take over we're gonna kill everybody that was and by the way we're about to take over
[02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:46.080]  and i was like are you serious he goes yeah we want to kill people we love blood and and and
[02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:50.560]  really they're they these are like demons or something they know it's all a con game they
[02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:58.240]  want to own the gas companies they want everything well the uh the average so-called regular liberal
[02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:04.800]  or democrat does not realize that the radicals have taken over the party today the democrat party
[02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:11.440]  is a radical socialist party they don't have any opposition within the party and if you oppose
[02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:17.600]  from the outside you're evil it's a the narrative they tell every day your racist your your they said
[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:22.720]  i'm behind the boss in bombing with no proof i want to play a clip of a larry who was in the
[02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:28.640]  weatherman meetings certified on record confirmed in court here it is and they felt that this
[02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:36.320]  counter-revolution could best be guarded against by creating and establishing reeducation centers
[02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:43.760]  in the southwest uh where we would take all the people who needed to be reeducated into the new
[02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:51.360]  way of thinking and teach them how things were going to be i ask well what is going to happen
[02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:58.560]  to those people that we can't reeducate better die hard cap capitalists and the reply was that
[02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:04.480]  they'd have to be eliminated and when i pursued this further they estimated that they would have
[02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:11.360]  to eliminate 25 million people in these reeducation centers and when i say eliminate i mean kill
[02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:20.720]  25 million people i want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people most of which have
[02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:30.400]  graduate degrees from columbia and other well-known there you go calmly talking about
[02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:35.440]  killing everybody i mean that's all they've got on their mind is killing people these are sick freaks
[02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:42.480]  they believe in this utopian fantasy of creating paradise on earth and if you don't go along with
[02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:49.360]  the fantasy you don't fit into utopia that's why they have to eliminate people who cannot be molded
[02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:56.880]  to fit into paradise that's why oprah winfrey she got the medal of freedom from obama oprah said
[02:18:57.680 --> 02:19:03.280]  people in the south generations of people need to die have to die they're gonna have to die
[02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:10.480]  and she gets a medal so the the utopian fantasy we've seen it in history over and over we don't
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:16.480]  have to learn it from the beginning we need to stick with the character of america the character
[02:19:16.480 --> 02:19:22.560]  emanates from the declaration of independence the bill of rights these created an american identity
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:30.000]  free markets free speech limited government that was the most successful paradise on earth so
[02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:36.720]  paradise is here this is it it doesn't get any better than kansas if you try to fix it the first
[02:19:36.720 --> 02:19:42.480]  time you hear someone say i've got the perfect formula for social change you better ask yourself
[02:19:43.200 --> 02:19:47.120]  what strikes am i going to be wearing this time exactly people always want me to give them some
[02:19:47.120 --> 02:19:53.520]  easy fix anybody that says they've got an easy fix is lying to you there aren't free lunches freedom

[02:24:09.200 --> 02:24:13.200]  we're joined by Joel Gilbert Joel Gilbert dot net he'll be with us till 40 after them
[02:24:13.200 --> 02:24:18.800]  gonna play some special reports and a lot more but i've studied history i'm addicted to reading
[02:24:18.800 --> 02:24:27.200]  history books studying different periods and i've never seen a time in history in the last 500 years
[02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:33.840]  or so what you call modern history since the renaissance when things are more delusional
[02:24:34.400 --> 02:24:39.040]  the propaganda being put out by the obama administration makes what clinton used to do
[02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:44.400]  look truthful makes bush look truthful he was incredible lies out of that administration
[02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:53.600]  now it's literally two plus two equals whatever we say and the only place i see stuff like that is
[02:24:53.600 --> 02:25:00.480]  north korea no one lies at this level whole cloth about everything and they're doing it on purpose
[02:25:00.480 --> 02:25:04.880]  to overthrow reality to where you're just accepting a whole new level of lies they're
[02:25:04.880 --> 02:25:10.560]  going to take us a trillion miles down the rat hole of fraud if we claw back 100 million they
[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:16.240]  don't care we're still 900 million miles down hell i think that's the tactic joel gilbert what do you
[02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:21.120]  think because we're gonna play the trailer for your new film come up the next segment but i mean
[02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:26.960]  what is the method to their madness when carney says last week this been gauze memo is not about
[02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:31.360]  been gauze we told you there are no been gauze memos therefore this is not about been gauze
[02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:37.600]  even though it says it's about been gauze i mean what is the method of their madness well when
[02:25:37.600 --> 02:25:45.360]  your entire agenda is been proven false over and over that it's a recipe for biological destruction
[02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:53.840]  and economic devastation the only way to sustain that agenda is through massive lies so we've entered
[02:25:53.840 --> 02:26:03.280]  an area of soviet disinformation and they use soviet censorship to attack and demean anyone
[02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:09.440]  who tells the truth unfortunately we know the result of a society that goes this direction well
[02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:14.000]  that's right i mean i mean persecution of the real press isn't coming it's hardcore
[02:26:14.880 --> 02:26:21.040]  over the top going on right now it's hardcore and uh i've experienced it you've experienced it
[02:26:21.040 --> 02:26:25.600]  denisha susan's been putting handcuffs he's experiencing it he's experiencing it i've been
[02:26:26.160 --> 02:26:31.840]  you know had the irs come after me and uh all kinds of operations against my bank account
[02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:36.720]  now they're using the tools of state this is their method of operation from the beginning
[02:26:36.720 --> 02:26:43.360]  from 1917 they used the tools of state to suppress any opposition and maintain a permanent hold on
[02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:48.640]  power they call us rebels to suppress rebels in the communist manifesto and they call us as you
[02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:54.400]  said the counter revolutionaries they know we're the americans they call us the americans they're
[02:26:54.400 --> 02:27:01.040]  in occupying army that's what people got uh executed for in the soviet union for being
[02:27:01.040 --> 02:27:08.080]  anti-soviet so if you're anti-soviet which is the commune or believing in the fantasy of utopia
[02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:14.160]  with god on earth in the presence of barack obama you are the enemy you're the devil who is god's
[02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:20.000]  enemy it's the devil you're evil so they never tell us why their ideas are good or bad or why
[02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:26.640]  their ideas are better they just say we're progress and we're good and you're evil this is the old
[02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:32.160]  game plan of well obama keeps saying george washington you know would love what i'm doing paul revere
[02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:36.640]  would no one should question me don't talk about government being in danger he's attacking the
[02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:41.920]  bedrock of american common sense absolutely well i can tell you though for my new film when i was
[02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:47.120]  running around the country it's kind of like a michael moore style film with actual real
[02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:53.600]  common sense content i go to newark the ruins of detroit slums of chicago and i can tell you that
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:59.200]  the people i met they'd all been seduced by these utopian promises living in cities that have been
[02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:05.040]  controlled by progressives for 50 years and no one was progressing they were all regressing
[02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:13.600]  but talking to these folks it's like you're at cpac i talked especially of black people black
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:19.920]  women minorities they sound like conservatives they wanted a wholesome life they did not want
[02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:24.960]  to be on welfare they didn't want government handouts they didn't want their kids smoking marijuana
[02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:30.720]  they didn't want amnesty for illegals they didn't want any part of this progressive agenda so in
[02:28:30.720 --> 02:28:35.600]  my my film you'll see there is some hope that uh well exactly that's what's crazy as you talked to
[02:28:35.600 --> 02:28:40.400]  poor whites poor blacks Hispanics they're pretty libertarian but they're being forced into the
[02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:46.880]  system which is the cloward and piven bankrupt everything so you don't have a choice yeah they
[02:28:46.880 --> 02:28:50.800]  were looking around their communities and saying it's getting worse and worse now i met and i show
[02:28:50.800 --> 02:28:56.160]  in the film you'll see in the trailer i met peggy joseph you if you remember her yes she was she
[02:28:56.160 --> 02:29:02.080]  was a lady that said in tampa at an obama rally in 2008 obama's gonna pay for my mortgage he's
[02:29:02.080 --> 02:29:09.280]  gonna pay for my gas remember her so i tracked her down and she said you know what i did some
[02:29:09.280 --> 02:29:16.320]  reading and i realized obama wasn't who he said he was he's a fraud he's like the wizard of us
[02:29:16.320 --> 02:29:23.680]  and she did not vote for him again and she can't stand the guy so once a little education if we can
[02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:29.280]  get through and give people the message and say look this progressivism is a road to regression
[02:29:29.280 --> 02:29:36.000]  it's a road to hell then they do come around so i was actually inspired from my journey i did
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:41.040]  find a lot of devastation from progressivism but i saw people whose eyes were starting to open
[02:29:41.040 --> 02:29:45.840]  yeah they've been given so much about their figuring out you know it's like a hammer over the head
[02:29:45.840 --> 02:29:50.960]  you know no more of that gift please we'll be right back with joe gilbert i'm alex jones we're on the

[02:33:12.400 --> 02:33:26.400]  we're living on the edge of the globalist using a democratic party and other socialists
[02:33:26.400 --> 02:33:32.240]  a total collectivization with the elite above the law exempt from the hell world they create
[02:33:32.240 --> 02:33:37.360]  on the front page of info wars dot com there's a graphic with a quote by glenn greenwald who i
[02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:43.520]  would call a real liberal i mean compared to these people he's on a fascist uh saying quote she's
[02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:50.080]  surrounded by all these sleazy money types who are just corrupting everything everywhere but she's
[02:33:50.080 --> 02:33:55.920]  going to be the first female president and women in america are going to be completely invested
[02:33:55.920 --> 02:34:03.600]  in her candidacy and he goes on in the article that paul watson wrote about to say that if you
[02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:09.520]  criticize her it'll be misogynistic this is the dumbing down and i covered this and after joel
[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:15.040]  leaves us after we play the trailer and give us some other issues where all over the country at
[02:34:15.040 --> 02:34:22.480]  dark myth and you name it they're banning taco bars that the different campus grips put on
[02:34:22.480 --> 02:34:26.400]  because what's cheap and easy and taste good and everybody likes tacos gosh i mean i probably
[02:34:26.400 --> 02:34:30.720]  eat 80 percent mexican food it's unbelievable it's not because i'm racist i grew up in texas i love
[02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:37.280]  it it's really good food the point is is that you know if you have a toga party at your university
[02:34:37.280 --> 02:34:41.120]  it's not because you're against greeks or if you have a fiesta it's because it's a party
[02:34:42.080 --> 02:34:48.080]  now we know that but they want to set the precedent where they can ban anything and everything they
[02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:54.640]  want to and then they dictate so they're now saying the word bossy it needs to be banned because it
[02:34:54.640 --> 02:34:59.920]  is a connotation to women no it's not but if they can ban the word bossy folks they can do anything
[02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:06.800]  and if they can ban now universities all over the country because one person complains
[02:35:07.600 --> 02:35:15.920]  per university that i don't like this particular fraternity or school group having a having a fiesta
[02:35:15.920 --> 02:35:22.160]  out at their pool what can i not have a hawaiian party i put on hawaiian parties back when we had
[02:35:22.160 --> 02:35:28.400]  a house with a pool have 10 15 friends come over grill stuff make it hawaiian style have a little
[02:35:28.400 --> 02:35:33.680]  tiki torches and hawaiian stuff i mean wear a hawaiian shirt i mean it's not against hawaiians
[02:35:33.680 --> 02:35:39.120]  it's like we're imagining we're in hawaii and i know you know that but people say these dumb liberals
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:45.520]  these dumb liberals they there's just idiots wanting to ban fiestas no they're not dumb they're
[02:35:45.520 --> 02:35:50.640]  taking over and they're doing it with fake moral high ground we're going to play his trailer and

[02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:06.480]  this is going because the so-called progressive communist they are the establishment now and
[02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:10.640]  they're just stealing everything inside total criminal force with the republicans bought off
[02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:15.760]  and controlled by them at the top working to kill the tea party with bainer and keeping obama care
[02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:22.000]  in place because there's corporate interest above this that want to use the communist system as their
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:26.800]  model of control just like the big banks use communist china to have their people billion plus
[02:38:26.800 --> 02:38:32.800]  slaves but here is the trailer for the film coming out in a few months joel gilbert's new

[02:39:14.240 --> 02:39:18.080]  utopia it's the kingdom of heaven on earth that's what they believe
[02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:24.880]  everything is boarded up we're just getting poorer honestly
[02:39:24.880 --> 02:39:29.680]  there's no home left anymore they're stuck in us they never get home

[02:39:50.880 --> 02:39:52.000]  here comes the secret service
[02:39:57.360 --> 02:40:01.280]  we're not becoming a utopia what i call it is the urban removal project

[02:41:04.240 --> 02:41:09.200]  you know specifically i'm not for the drug war but i also know that now they have weaponized
[02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:15.280]  weed that turns people into literal zombies i mean the marijuana and i've been honest about this
[02:41:15.280 --> 02:41:20.720]  i smoked a little bit of marijuana in high school never really liked it and so i can speak to the
[02:41:20.720 --> 02:41:26.800]  power of it when i'm out in california or in colorada i have smoked weaponized marijuana
[02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:34.720]  probably about once a year and it's so strong ladies and gentlemen that three hits off of it
[02:41:34.720 --> 02:41:40.560]  and i mean you're definitely a different person and i'm just being honest the people out there
[02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:44.960]  that are ultra conservative and neurotic about it he smokes marijuana at least i told you i inhale
[02:41:44.960 --> 02:41:51.520]  as a test they have police smoke it every year so they can tell the effects of it the absolutely
[02:41:51.520 --> 02:41:56.800]  dan rather took lsd to see what was happening the point is is that i will tell you it's very
[02:41:56.800 --> 02:42:02.240]  destructive but you should i don't think we put everybody in prison because they're using it but
[02:42:02.240 --> 02:42:06.880]  it doesn't mean i endorse george soro saying give it to everybody i mean you smoke this stuff now
[02:42:06.880 --> 02:42:12.080]  it's got to be a hundred times stronger than the pot my parents were around in the 60s and the
[02:42:12.080 --> 02:42:18.080]  marijuana the so-called best marijuana that i would smoke you know maybe once a month or something
[02:42:18.080 --> 02:42:22.480]  in high school at a party or something uh that i didn't like i'm like why did i smoke that again
[02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:28.240]  i hate it the stuff they got now is unbelievable it's a hallucinogen basically where you don't
[02:42:28.240 --> 02:42:33.840]  even know who you are and so there's that you know i want to know first i mean your angle on
[02:42:33.840 --> 02:42:37.840]  the drug wars i haven't seen the film yet obviously and then when we talk about all the you know the
[02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:41.680]  fact that the country's being converted to latin america the point is those people in the demographics
[02:42:41.680 --> 02:42:47.120]  are voting socialist and so soon it'll be game over i would all be for latin americans pouring in
[02:42:47.120 --> 02:42:53.280]  if they were uh you know ron paul types uh but it is a demographic thing the democrats brag they'll
[02:42:53.280 --> 02:42:58.400]  get the guns they'll get our kids they're gonna get everything because the hispanic wave coming in
[02:42:58.400 --> 02:43:03.040]  that's the majority in most states now somehow has been sold the democrats love them jill gilbert
[02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:07.280]  you've got the floor for about five minutes where do you see all this going okay thanks a lot all
[02:43:07.280 --> 02:43:12.800]  first comment on the issue of the uh marijuana legalization and the drug war you're obviously
[02:43:12.800 --> 02:43:18.080]  referring to back in the 60s there's a reason they called it grass because it pretty much
[02:43:18.080 --> 02:43:23.280]  tasted like grass and wasn't all that effective it was more recreational the marijuana that's
[02:43:23.280 --> 02:43:30.880]  being sold today and legalized in colorado is a very potent form and it makes the uh the reason
[02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:36.640]  for it it makes the population a little more docile and makes them easier to enslave and and
[02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:43.200]  dictate to uh anybody who's been to a high school reunion remembers that everybody who
[02:43:43.200 --> 02:43:48.880]  did a lot of pot in high school that nothing became of them they're still smoking pot they're
[02:43:48.880 --> 02:43:54.800]  hanging around with their old friends and doing some menial job because there really are detrimental
[02:43:54.800 --> 02:44:01.440]  effects of marijuana on youth and it leads to to a lot of negativity statistically it does
[02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:05.360]  there's some type of personalities that would have had a heart attack if they didn't have it
[02:44:05.360 --> 02:44:10.720]  there's some executive types who do use it but under under controlled circumstances like you
[02:44:10.720 --> 02:44:15.920]  have a glass of scotch on saturday night they're not drinking scotch 12 hours a day right you might
[02:44:15.920 --> 02:44:20.560]  be okay but uh there's a lot of uh things that are detrimental that they don't want to let you
[02:44:20.560 --> 02:44:26.400]  know about they'd rather make it legal and then use that to their advantage the the game plan of the
[02:44:26.400 --> 02:44:33.600]  democrat socialists is to use every issue if it's climate change if it's income inequality
[02:44:33.600 --> 02:44:39.760]  anything they can do to agitate the public they do that to polarize people and then use
[02:44:39.760 --> 02:44:47.760]  that discontent to take and keep power obama is a professional agitator he started his career in
[02:44:47.760 --> 02:44:54.160]  chicago as a community organizer but the word organizer was simply a nice word that was a
[02:44:54.160 --> 02:44:59.360]  little more acceptable to the it's really he's a foundation run uh el sharpton right his job
[02:44:59.360 --> 02:45:04.880]  was community agitator at that time the white communists were not successful getting the black
[02:45:04.880 --> 02:45:10.080]  churches to join their causes in chicago because blacks were religious people they didn't want
[02:45:10.080 --> 02:45:17.120]  any part of this nonsense so they send in a front man with a black face in barack obama to agitate
[02:45:17.120 --> 02:45:23.200]  the population rub salt in their wounds about economic differences and then use that discontent
[02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:27.360]  to take power and by the way they wrote books admitting that i mean it's not like we're just
[02:45:27.360 --> 02:45:34.160]  saying this no obama not only studied this but he taught this for 10 years he was an acorn agitator
[02:45:34.160 --> 02:45:39.120]  and organizer so everything obama says when every opens his mouth you have to remember
[02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:44.000]  he's a professional agitator that's his only skill he doesn't know anything about economics
[02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:50.000]  he doesn't know anything about uh the constitution or care about it he only cares about agitating
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:56.320]  so everything he says is intended to agitate and divide america unfortunately as you know alex
[02:45:56.320 --> 02:46:02.800]  the the the mainstream media and then some refuse to question obama about who he was and who his
[02:46:02.800 --> 02:46:09.680]  background who his friends are who's your real father why did you spend 20 years in the shadowy
[02:46:09.680 --> 02:46:16.400]  world of american marxism and now you're saying you're a nice benevolent centrist the inability
[02:46:16.400 --> 02:46:21.520]  of the media to do its job led us down this path to this point sure and i used to always think it
[02:46:21.520 --> 02:46:25.200]  was exaggerated or made up that he was a secret you know radical muslim or whatever because i'm
[02:46:25.200 --> 02:46:29.760]  not you know anti islam i'm anti radical islam but now we learn he is connected through his family
[02:46:29.760 --> 02:46:34.720]  in kenya laundering the money to overthrow the egyptian government put in al qaeda light
[02:46:34.720 --> 02:46:41.440]  they're involved put al qaeda in syria libya i mean they're so evil well they're so evil i can't
[02:46:41.440 --> 02:46:46.640]  even believe it these are like mega gangsters well they say world view they have same as the
[02:46:46.640 --> 02:46:53.440]  weather underground of world revolution world agitation and then using that the problems and
[02:46:53.440 --> 02:46:59.520]  the chaos to take and maintain power and take away our liberties one after the other that's why
[02:46:59.520 --> 02:47:04.720]  you see in the film you can see the poster back here there's obama waving american flag in one hand
[02:47:04.720 --> 02:47:12.160]  god bless america but behind his back he clearly has an agenda of marxism and socialism that has
[02:47:12.160 --> 02:47:17.920]  nothing to do with american values obama has been assaulting the constitution from the moment he
[02:47:17.920 --> 02:47:26.400]  started running for president from the moment he supported acorn in chicago to attack city bank and
[02:47:26.400 --> 02:47:31.920]  forced them to change their lending standards which set the ground for the subprime mortgage crisis
[02:47:31.920 --> 02:47:36.800]  yeah and then all the democrats made money off of it you know the only saving grace here is that
[02:47:36.800 --> 02:47:41.440]  there's such a mafia criminal stealing stuff that they're not going to want total communism was they
[02:47:41.440 --> 02:47:45.600]  want to keep the loot they've stolen the problem is they're now exempt from their own taxes in most
[02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:51.760]  cases on record well and that's the most dangerous perfect storm there where where they literally
[02:47:51.760 --> 02:47:56.880]  are above the law now what do you think of joe biden's son being appointed to head up the state run
[02:47:57.440 --> 02:48:02.720]  gas company groups connected groups in ukraine this is getting too obvious well it's not that it's
[02:48:02.720 --> 02:48:08.160]  too obvious it's that they if they get away with things along the way they just push it to the next
[02:48:08.160 --> 02:48:12.720]  level they got away with fast and furious so they could get away with bin gazi they get away
[02:48:12.720 --> 02:48:17.600]  with bin gazi they get away with the irs scandal so there's literally no opposition in the democrat
[02:48:17.600 --> 02:48:23.520]  party no opposition in the media they've crushed the opposition of the tea party using the tools of
[02:48:23.520 --> 02:48:29.280]  states so with no opposition they just do what they want and laugh at us that's what it's come to
[02:48:30.160 --> 02:48:34.720]  so so what do you predict now i mean they have just gang raped the country up one side and down
[02:48:34.720 --> 02:48:39.920]  the other but all caught in charge of half a dozen countries are just running around psychopathically
[02:48:39.920 --> 02:48:45.440]  shutting down our coal power plants as power prices explode obama cares designed to bankrupt the country
[02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:54.320]  looks like um it's just unbelievable what happens well i'm hoping that my movie will lay it all out
[02:48:54.320 --> 02:48:59.280]  for everybody and if we can get millions of people to come see there's no place like utopia this summer
[02:48:59.280 --> 02:49:05.520]  it exposes the entire progressive radical agenda who these guys are and it shows that the grassroots
[02:49:05.520 --> 02:49:11.840]  of america is completely against all of this nonsense that they peddle every day as public
[02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:17.280]  policy so we're actually opening in denver in july we'll be announcing the theater soon
[02:49:17.280 --> 02:49:21.200]  and from there we're going to try to go nationwide for those that don't know it needs to sell out
[02:49:21.200 --> 02:49:25.680]  for a week at one theater then more theaters will order it and then over the next few months
[02:49:25.680 --> 02:49:30.640]  it'll go up to hundreds and then thousands of screens and uh you know i again i'm not getting
[02:49:30.640 --> 02:49:34.960]  paid to promote this film i haven't even seen it yet i support independent film and i would just
[02:49:34.960 --> 02:49:38.880]  expect you'll give us a good deal on the dvds as soon as those come out so we can sell them and
[02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:44.160]  help fund our operation while getting getting the truth out about the fact that this is pure evil
[02:49:44.160 --> 02:49:48.560]  from my research though they've got communists and socialists mid-level and even high-level
[02:49:48.560 --> 02:49:54.240]  that are true believers but most of them at the top are just hardcore gangster psychopath control
[02:49:54.240 --> 02:50:00.720]  freaks uh who literally are just using this system as a tool of control well there's no question that
[02:50:00.720 --> 02:50:08.480]  a radical ideology like communism and marxism attracts the worst most deviant control freaks
[02:50:08.480 --> 02:50:13.120]  there are in the country who could care less about the ideology they're there for the exploitation
[02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:19.440]  and you see that throughout all of these communist regimes over time and obamas is filled
[02:50:19.440 --> 02:50:24.400]  with these types of communism is a total hell pit i mean it's like begging to be sent to hell
[02:50:24.400 --> 02:50:32.640]  it's hell on earth and it's a tragedy that we the american regular average folks don't really
[02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:37.600]  know and understand the history that when you follow the yellow brick road to a magical person
[02:50:37.600 --> 02:50:43.440]  who's going to solve all your problems when you arrive there you arrive to hell on earth not to
[02:50:43.440 --> 02:50:50.960]  paradise that's it and i mean wow they really are trying to set up an authoritarian hell pit
[02:50:50.960 --> 02:50:55.120]  and they're hell bent on doing it they hate this country joe gilbert thank you so much

[02:54:03.760 --> 02:54:12.160]  disinformation it's alex jones on the gcn radio network every year colleges across the country
[02:54:12.160 --> 02:54:17.920]  hold annual all you can eat taco fiestas but apparently that was a little offensive to some
[02:54:17.920 --> 02:54:23.520]  this year so they ban the word fiesta from college campuses you can't wear some breros you
[02:54:23.520 --> 02:54:29.840]  can't wear racially insensitive cowboy in indian costumes and all sorts of things have we gone
[02:54:29.840 --> 02:54:37.920]  too far should we make fiesta change their name because it is racist and offensive to a handful
[02:54:37.920 --> 02:54:43.200]  of people a lot of college campuses now are having to stop throwing parties that have a
[02:54:43.200 --> 02:54:47.920]  cultural theme because people find it offensive a lot of parties were shut down for a single to
[02:54:47.920 --> 02:54:56.400]  mile for instance um why do you think people are offended by tacos some breros tequila
[02:54:57.200 --> 02:55:03.280]  just people just find a bunch of different like racial things it's uh like so like for instance
[02:55:03.280 --> 02:55:07.760]  like you said the taco shirt or like some breros and stuff like that they think like you're making
[02:55:07.760 --> 02:55:12.160]  fun of them type things or something like that you know so much people just have different
[02:55:12.160 --> 02:55:18.160]  perspectives on things like that i don't think it's racist is part of someone's culture it's good
[02:55:18.160 --> 02:55:23.040]  to have different in different countries they have american parties so i don't understand
[02:55:23.600 --> 02:55:27.760]  we don't think it's racist we think it's kind of cool to see like they want to have
[02:55:27.760 --> 02:55:34.960]  our type of culture over there so for us to be sensitive and to shut down sinko to mile parties
[02:55:34.960 --> 02:55:40.880]  that's it's going a little too far i'm not kind of guy that doesn't really get head offended that
[02:55:40.880 --> 02:55:45.920]  much so i think a lot of it's blown out of proportion yeah i understand being sensitive
[02:55:45.920 --> 02:55:51.520]  to people but it seems like recently more and more um they're getting more nitpicky about
[02:55:51.520 --> 02:55:57.600]  what to be offended about it seems like being offended is the cool thing to to be so i don't
[02:55:57.600 --> 02:56:06.400]  think so no i don't i mean yes to the students where the yeah well they basically say they can
[02:56:06.400 --> 02:56:14.080]  have fiesta because having a fiesta is racist i don't think so what look at this liberated person
[02:56:14.080 --> 02:56:28.800]  here do you think that i should learn spanish i feel like we've gotten very politically correct
[02:56:28.800 --> 02:56:36.480]  taking it to the extreme is that politically correct though is it because or is it just being really
[02:56:36.480 --> 02:56:40.960]  sensitive like you're saying because i mean we're here in america we're supposed to be equality
[02:56:41.520 --> 02:56:47.680]  any race that's what we were built upon and now now it's like no no don't be don't do that you're
[02:56:47.680 --> 02:56:52.640]  too yeah it's supposed to be about embracing other cultures but now it's like no you can't do that
[02:56:52.640 --> 02:56:57.360]  because that doesn't represent me in this particular case at dartmouth it was one girl that said she
[02:56:57.360 --> 02:57:02.720]  was offended and the other students were like why this is it's just fun it's a fiesta they're not
[02:57:02.720 --> 02:57:07.760]  allowed to say the word fiesta it just seems like it that's uh it's all the rage you know yeah well
[02:57:07.760 --> 02:57:13.280]  it seems like when you go to college and get a degree that's the new thing is to fight for these
[02:57:14.240 --> 02:57:20.480]  arbitrary offenses against your culture or this or that meanwhile you know they're playing white
[02:57:20.480 --> 02:57:26.480]  privilege blame games at some colleges and and like me as a white person i'm i'm not allowed to
[02:57:26.480 --> 02:57:30.320]  say anything because they're like well dude that's white privilege and check your privilege
[02:57:30.320 --> 02:57:35.920]  yeah i my mom didn't pay for me to go to school but that's what they're saying is that i had a
[02:57:35.920 --> 02:57:42.640]  privileged life and that i didn't work really hard should i be offended i would if i was in your
[02:57:42.640 --> 02:57:51.680]  situation yeah i would it's like as well if they were like you didn't build that i tried it's like i
[02:57:51.680 --> 02:57:57.040]  tried my hardest to get to where i am today and and for you to take that away from me that's that's
[02:57:57.040 --> 02:58:04.240]  horrible and then for them to say no we can do it for you but you can't say anything bad about us
[02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:09.360]  it's like where's where's the equalness i don't know do you think it's okay that only white people
[02:58:09.360 --> 02:58:17.440]  should be able to have hamburgers no we we did that no i don't think it's okay i mean like myself
[02:58:17.440 --> 02:58:22.400]  you couldn't tell that i'm i'm mixed my mom is my dad's black and white and my mom is mexican
[02:58:22.400 --> 02:58:27.360]  so i was like i got everything in me well apparently now america has become the place
[02:58:27.360 --> 02:58:50.320]  where we stop celebrating it's the the manila envelope of the world
