[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]  ...these years, but it's good to have him on. Dennis Lawrence Cuddy, historian and political
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.400]  analyst, cheated PhD from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, major in American
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.120]  history, minor in political science. Dr. Cuddy has taught university level, has been a political
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.840]  and economic risk analysis analyst for international consulting firm, has been a senior
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.400]  associate with the U.S. Department of Education. He's also testified before members of Congress
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:31.440]  on behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice. Dr. Cuddy has authored or edited 17 books and booklets
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.360]  and has written hundreds of articles appearing in newspapers around the nation, including the
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.320]  Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, USA Today. He has been a guest on numerous radio talk shows,
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.080]  and now he's here with us, and he really digs out. I like his books because, you know, he doesn't say
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.520]  they plan to dumb us down and enslave us, worse than Nazi Germany. He has the globalists saying
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.000]  in his books and when and where they said it, how they're going to break the family up,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.640]  how they're going to force drug you, how they're going to take your guns.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.640]  Dr. Cuddy, great to have you on the show today. Thanks for having me.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.200]  You bet. Launch into it. I love your new book about 9-1-1, but what are we facing right now?
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.760]  How do we stop the New World Order? What is the New World Order?
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:22.800]  Well, the New World Order is a concept that goes back many years when George Herbert Walker Bush
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.840]  used it. Everybody thought it was something of a new term, but H.G. Wells, the famous author,
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.080]  had a book by that name back in 1939. Even earlier than that, you find books by that title.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.000]  By the way, folks can download that for free at PrisonPlanet.com. It's online.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.400]  Or they call for the World Government. Adolf Hitler called for it. Joseph Stalin called for it.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.320]  All these guys called for it.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.000]  That's correct. The plan goes back many years. There's several branches to it. On the one hand,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.640]  you have Cecil Rhodes' plan to take over, as he said, to take the government of the whole world
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.160]  using Rhodes scholars like Bill Clinton and others. There's another avenue of it that goes
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.200]  through the Fabian Socialists. Now they're called the Third Way. There's another branch of it,
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.400]  Skull and Bones. This is the Bushes and some other individuals. But they're all
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.840]  moving in what Wells called, and I'll get to how that applies right now, to a synthesis.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.480]  What they're doing is they're trying to synthesize Eastern communism and Western capitalism into a
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.040]  world socialist government. In terms of how that plays out with this current escapade in Iraq,
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.400]  the thesis is that the U.N. should direct everything under U.N. resolutions. You should
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.920]  do what they say. The antithesis is that the Anglo-American alliance that Cecil Rhodes planned
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.640]  to run everything would be the dominant force. The synthesis is that you combine the Anglo-American
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.640]  alliance with about 49 other nations but nowhere near a majority of the U.N. That's what's happened.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.000]  It's a dialectic that constantly goes on over the years.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]  Wow. We need to have you on more often because no one seems to get this. About four years ago,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.080]  I'd heard of some policy reports. They couldn't deny that there was a new world order anymore.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.440]  You were crazy before to talk about it as presidents said it. Now they read their own
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.080]  reports and policy papers, their own white papers. I've heard of seeing the left say,
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.000]  okay, there is a world government. Will the left control it or will the right?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.760]  Going back to the left-right paradigm, the Paul system, what we're going to have is the
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.400]  U.N. playing the part of the good cop. America kind of as the new Soviet Union,
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.000]  chewing up, grabbing the countries up, getting them under globalist control when the same bankers
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.120]  own it all, own the U.N., own the Anglo-American establishment that Quigley talked about.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.360]  They need to create the illusion globally that there's a choice inside this new world order
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.560]  making the U.N. play the part of the good guy. That's right. When you mentioned the bankers,
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.760]  and as I appreciate your mentioning, I've let the people speak for themselves. I try and put
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.600]  these documents, letters signed by Churchill or Roosevelt. One letter that I include in the book,
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.080]  The Globalist, is FDR writing to Colonel House, Woodrow Wilson's chief advisor, saying,
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.480]  the real truth of the matter is you and I know that a financial element in our larger centers
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.280]  has owned our government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson. You're right on that.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.480]  Well, old House, he lived right down the road from here in Austin.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.200]  Yeah, his grandfather just happened to be one of the very few people that came out of the
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.280]  Civil War making a lot of money. Of course, that was manipulated by the British on both sides.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.320]  How do we stop the new world order? How do we educate the left and the right that they're
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.680]  really just part of a phony system? Well, the first thing, you have to crack through their
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.120]  predisposition to think you're a nut if you talk about conspiracy theories. The best way to do that
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.120]  is the way I do it is I set them up by saying, suppose I told you there was a power somewhere
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.360]  so complete, so pervasive, so interlocked, so watchful, you better not speak above your breath
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.280]  if you speak in condemnation of it. After they get finished laughing in my face for a while,
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.080]  I say, well, I didn't say that one of your heroes, Woodrow Wilson, said that. Now you've got their
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:12.480]  attention. And so you bring them up to today and explain how this is happening, how through,
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.960]  let's say, Tavistock, British intelligence and so forth, they developed a theory, for example,
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:25.440]  called the theory of social turbulence, where through a number of crises, emotional crises,
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.760]  they cause people to go into psychological retreat. You get turned off of things.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.640]  They found that if you agitate a colony of rats long enough, they kind of submit and become docile.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.920]  That's right. That's right. And so this is very scientific. Way, way back, Edward Bernays,
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:46.080]  the father of public opinion, said we, in effect, he was writing this in 1928 when he became the
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.720]  chief advisor to CBS's William Paley. He wrote a book, Propaganda, where he says,
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.640]  we're like a government. We know how to manipulate you, and that's what we're going to do.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:02.000]  And now they're getting rid of all pretense that they're fair and balanced. Now they've removed the
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.560]  left-right debate, and it's just, oh, we're this big imperial army. We're now seeing the war emperor
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.600]  with his troops every day in military outfits. They're following the old patterns, as you said,
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:20.800]  with the overlay of technology. That's right. It's what I've called the techno-feudal, F-E-U-D-A-O,
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.120]  society of the future. And that was 100 years ago in a book called Our Benevolent Feudalism,
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:33.040]  where they mapped this out. I guess I just spontaneously came up with my own
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.840]  term without reading that, neo-feudalism. Sure. Yeah, it is that.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.080]  Well, what is feudalism? Because before 100 years ago, Dr. Cuddy, people knew that it was
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.120]  two types of governments, all the different varieties of tyranny on one side and liberty
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.960]  on the other, and it was always looked at according to freedom, at least in this country
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.600]  and the experiment here. Now it's shifted to that left-right debate where people can't even
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.000]  get to real discussions because, again, we're always caught up in the two phony choices.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:12.080]  Right. And two things. First of all, politically, that was planned by the Skull and Bones Whitney's
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:18.400]  in the late 1800s, where they mapped out a plan whereby they would contribute to both Democrat
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.920]  and Republican, left and right, and then they would deliberately alternate power among these
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.160]  politicians so that the stupid public would think they have a choice, but they didn't.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.720]  And it also adds, as you said in one of your books, that they like to use competition.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.280]  Oh, yeah. The agenda moves forward, but for the henchmen to get top positions,
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.080]  whoever can drive and manipulate the best gets the CEO job of Slavery Incorporated.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.920]  Yeah, and there's various avenues. You have the Cecil Rhodes Avenue where they would,
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:52.000]  he said, penetrate journalism, economics, education, and politics,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.280]  and get their key people into certain places. Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.400]  That was an outgrowth, right. The CFR was an outgrowth along with the Royal Institute for
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.280]  International Affairs, and Colonel Halsey, you mentioned earlier, said if the First World War
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.400]  had not come in fierce and exaggerated form, they would not have been able to get that.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.920]  And I'm glad you brought that up. That's another example of what you can throw into people's faces
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:20.640]  who are skeptics, because whenever you say the CFR, their eyes start to roll around and so on.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.360]  So what I do is I say, okay, look, Bill Clinton, you're a liberal, let's say,
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.440]  I'm talking to. You're a liberal. You like Bill Clinton? Oh, yes. Well, his mentor,
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.320]  Carol Quigley at Georgetown, looked at the, quote, secret records of this power elite,
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.320]  and in his book, Tragedy and Hope, he said that these people, the CFR,
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:43.040]  is a front group for these people. Now, they may be skeptical. I say, okay, listen to this.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:48.160]  Arthur Schlesinger, the year before that book, In a Thousand Days, his book in 1965,
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.960]  and he's a member of the CFR, said the same thing. It's a front group. The CFR is a front
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:57.200]  group for this power elite. Well, that's the incredible thing. Their own publication,
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.080]  Foreign Affairs, says they're going to enslave us, going to dumb us down.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.120]  They're saying it, and then you read it, and a cop on the street will say, Alex,
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:11.440]  we were given a briefing. We know that's code for terror. And I go, sir, CFR is on TV now.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.040]  They don't exist. How do they brainwash them? How do the FBI training manuals, Dr. Cuddy,
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.240]  say that those that say there's a new world order are potential terrorists,
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.040]  that it doesn't exist? How do they have presidents announcing it,
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.760]  but then double think saying it doesn't exist? That's right. I hear the music,
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.320]  but I guess we're going to break. Yes, we'll get the answer from Dr. Cuddy.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.600]  Great to talk to him. We'll talk about some of his great books. I've read, I don't know,
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.920]  three or four of them. He's written 17. It's all coming up, and we'll tell you about some
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.360]  of the websites and newspapers he writes for. Abel, open the phones. I hope you can stay with
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.960]  us into the next hour or two. She'll have plenty of time to take calls. I got a bunch of current
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:51.840]  news and events I want to mention to him. Thanks for listening to the M2K talk archives,
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:58.000]  and we are listeners supported with the honors system. We ask that you wait. Don't donate a
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.400]  dollar at a time. PayPal charges a 35 cent surcharge on anything of a dollar or less.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:09.920]  Wait till you listen to five or 10 and then donate, please. We appreciate your voluntary
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:17.440]  support. Don't worry. This show is documented. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:35.760]  Worked in and out of the federal government, written a whole bunch of books, really insightful,
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:41.280]  understands the paradigm we're facing. Neocons, a lot of them, these talk show hosts are admitted
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:47.520]  beaten X, communist, turned conservative. A lot of the neocon leaders, daddies and mommies were
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.640]  leading Marxists. Then they're hooked up with a weird Eastern establishment, blue blood clan,
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:58.400]  who hail from a place called the tombs, skull and bones. We're talking about a collection of
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:04.080]  maniacs, but they know what they're doing. I think it's obvious, Dr. Cuddy, they're really moving in
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:11.840]  on one of the big steps in their final phase, aren't they? Yeah. Believe it or not, some time
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:18.560]  ago in Austin, Texas, connection to all this. I'll just do this really quick since you brought this
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:26.800]  up. William Crystal is editor of the Weekly Standard magazine. Murdoch propaganda arm just
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:33.280]  called for new world order yesterday. That's right. In fact, I'll digress just a minute,
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.560]  because you were talking about how can these people say there's no new world order.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:44.240]  Usually, if you look at the CFR's Journal of Foreign Affairs, for example, in April of
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:53.760]  last year, what you had was President Bush was not really ... He had already called Iraq and
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:59.360]  North Korea the Iran axis of evil, but he was dilly-dallying until the CFR's Foreign Affairs
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.320]  came out with an article saying next stop Baghdad. Then he walks into Condoleezza Rice's office and
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:09.040]  says, what are we going to do about Saddam? Same thing now. If you look at the May-June issue
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:16.000]  just come out of the CFR's Foreign Affairs, there's an article there by Michael Glennan.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.600]  I think his name is specifically using that term that what we have to build here is a new world
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:27.680]  order through ad hoc coalitions of the willing. Once again, they're using the terms and they're
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:34.400]  mapping out the future. In terms of William Kristol, let me give you ... This will take 30
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:40.960]  seconds or so, but it's interesting. William Kristol is the head of the Project of the New
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:48.000]  American Century, which had mapped out a lot of what happened regarding Iraq and the removal of
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.680]  Saddam and threatening ... He's written letters. They have threatening retaliation against Iran
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:13:00.480]  and Syria if they don't comply with our wishes and so on. Some of these letters are signed also
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.920]  by other people, Richard Pearl, William Bennett, who's been in the news lately. Since I mentioned
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.600]  him ... By the way, Bennett's off running around with $1.4 million gambling debts.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:19.200]  Right. The connection to Austin goes like this. William Kristol is where he is now. I believe,
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:26.160]  as you said, their daddies have something to do with this because of a plan. I'll try to be
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.760]  brief about this. Many, many years ago, William Bennett, when he was a young fellow, hooked up
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:37.680]  with William Sloan Coffin, the radical preacher back during the Vietnam War days who was also
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:45.680]  a member of Skull and Bones and the CIA as well. They were friends. Sloan Coffin and some others at
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:51.040]  Williams College where he was attending said, why don't you go down to Austin, Texas. There,
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.840]  hook up with a ... I forget. It begins with a K. It's a philosophy professor where Bennett
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:02.480]  wrote a dissertation, which was rather strange and very short dissertation. At the first of it,
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:08.320]  he says something to the effect, gentlemen even keep their promises even in hell. This was his
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:14.320]  dedication. He gets out of there very quickly. In fact, he is attending Harvard Law School
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:19.360]  the first year of Harvard Law while he's still working on his dissertation, which told me
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.960]  his paths was being greased at that time. He had hooked up with Irving Kristol's
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:29.760]  commentary magazine and they were giving him publicity through book reviews. The next thing
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:34.880]  you know, Charles Frankel, who was on the editorial board of the Humanist magazine,
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:40.080]  gets Bennett to be his assistant at the National Humanities Center near where I live here,
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.200]  just a few miles away. For folks that don't know, these guys, and it's admitted in the
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.640]  mainstream news, all come from communist, Marxist, socialist men.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:53.600]  Yeah. The neo-cons, the Irving Kristols, his wife, Gertrude Himmelfarb, their partners,
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.240]  Norman Puthoritz and Mitch Dexter, who even in the 90s was a vice president of
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:03.600]  the League for Industrial Democracy, formerly titled the Intercollegiate Socialist Society,
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:11.840]  were old Trotskyites or whatever. Bush calls himself a communitarian. Well,
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.640]  that definition, one who promotes communist systems.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:19.120]  Yeah. If you look at Amitai Etzioni and the leaders of this, there's another one named
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:23.360]  Locke. I want to stop you again. They're publicly saying new world order, world empire,
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:28.240]  then when we say it, it doesn't exist, we're insane. They publicly say, we are communists,
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:32.960]  we are communitarians, and we point it out, people go, how crazy. I mean, how do they get
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:39.360]  away with that? Well, right now, if you ask them, they would not say we are communists. They'll say
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:45.520]  something else, but they flow from the old Trotskyite days years ago. And so what happened
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.920]  is, do I hear the music? Yeah, we've got a few seconds left, but just stay there, Dr. Cuddy.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.680]  I want to get into 911 with you, the book you've written. I want to talk about the
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.800]  globalist plan, how to stop a man take calls. Stay right there. We're honored to have you.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:05.520]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:15.600]  Nuclear reactors. The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.560]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:29.360]  Folks, I'm going to tell you the truth. Our family's futures, our very lives,
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:34.480]  ain't in the balance. I have read globalist policy reports. I like to go to the Army War College.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.080]  I have found a lot of what they're really going to do with the actual hardware of the
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.640]  police state. I mean, I read an Army War College report from 68, where they said that by 2000,
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:52.320]  they wanted inkless fingerprint readers to buy and sell. I read British Army Psychological Warfare
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:57.600]  manuals written in the forties and everything they talk about is being used on the nightly news,
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:02.560]  but with more sophistication. Now, Dr. Cuddy has a PhD in this, has worked with the federal
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:06.640]  government and comes highly recommended by Charlotte Iserby and others that we've had on.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:13.120]  When you read their plan to turn your kid into a crackhead, when you read their plan
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:18.400]  to make our economy a prison state, when you read the plan and Dr. Cuddy isn't a great example of
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:24.880]  this Bush wants to reaffirm the Clinton gun ban and magazine ban and wants more gun control
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:31.920]  and the neo-con just creatures on talk radio will not tell the listeners that. I mean,
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:37.200]  isn't this a great example to people of the fact that the Republican leadership isn't what
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:41.840]  they claim to be? And then we read articles about how there's this alliance and this love fest.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.240]  Bush is having dinner with Charles Schumer. They love each other. What's really going on?
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:56.640]  Yeah. Again, Carol Quigley, Bill Clinton's mentor said he wanted to basically assist them,
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.400]  the power elite and him. Quigley loved these guys. He said these were the
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:07.200]  hope of the world. That you could, quote, kick the rascals out, but not really change anything.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:12.800]  That's why even though you have Clinton supposedly different from the Bushes, they all support
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:17.760]  NAFTA and GATT, World Trade Organization, most favored nation status for China and so on.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:22.960]  Ungrabbing open borders, supercomputers to communist China. Clinton gave some of the
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:27.600]  computers to China. He was evil and bad and yes he was. Then Bush takes all restrictions off
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:34.560]  and I heard Limbaugh go, ah, so what? Yeah. The first President Bush's brother,
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:39.200]  while they were saying how horrible Tiananmen Square was, was over there making satellite
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:45.040]  communications deal with those people while playing a bit of golf. And now I think one of
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:50.400]  them is trying to get in on, or is Neil, I guess it's Neil Bush, trying to get in on the education
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:56.160]  act over in Iraq with perhaps William Bennett as well. They may have something going themselves.
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.800]  But the plan, as you asked, the plan... Wait a minute. Bennett needs some money,
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.040]  man. When you drop 1.4 million in a weekend, you've got to, you know,
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.800]  at the tracker in Atlantic City, you need some cash.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:16.000]  Well, yeah, but see, when you have a book like the Book of Virtues, which all these, as you said,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.480]  the conservatives and Christians love, that includes a lot of Greek gods and goddesses,
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:27.040]  Castor and Pollux, when it's Yiddish there at heaven's gate, where little Yiddish there
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:33.120]  threatens God unless he can bring his doggy into heaven. He's not coming. And when you have the
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:38.880]  road to Dao, where it says not only should you not be greedy, you should do away with charity and
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:44.080]  good virtues too, because only then do you really have it made. And when you have Thomas Jefferson
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:48.640]  quoted as saying to a child, think about whether there's a God or not, and if you've come to
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:53.600]  conclusion there's not one, that's okay too. But Dr. Cuddy, isn't Skull and Bones a premier
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:59.440]  Christian organization? A what? Well, I mean, people say he's a born-again Christian. Don't
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:03.440]  talk bad about him. They're not a Christian. I mean, is it Skull and Bones then? Is it the
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:13.680]  Order of Death and Satan loving? Not really. They hook up through various mechanisms with
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:18.160]  Illuminati and other groups. You know what? I'm jumping all over and I apologize. I'm going to
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.680]  try to shut up here in a minute. Let me bring this forward. Are you aware that I snuck into
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:26.560]  Bohemia Grove? Yes, sir. I've seen the video. Very good. Well, I mean, I frankly couldn't
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:31.520]  believe it. I saw the news articles. The British media got me a map in, some of the code words from
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:36.080]  spies inside. And I frankly believe I was actually allowed to sneak in there now that I look at it
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:42.320]  as part of a larger throw in our face move. But I mean, this is out and out. Moloch Satan
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:47.680]  worship 101. Anton LaVey. You know, Marilyn Monroe. The same thing that you see at the
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:53.360]  little house in San Francisco I saw there with the Bushes. This is admitted, the Grove admits
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:59.360]  I went in. But still, you're not supposed to talk about it. How does the satanic element behind all
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:05.280]  this operate? Talk about the Illuminati, the history of this. Who are we really dealing with?
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.600]  Well, first, did you see any people running around naked there?
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.720]  It goes on for 15 days. I was there at the kickoff. David Gergen in The Washington
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:19.120]  Times said that they do indeed do that. Spy Magazine admits that they ship in the
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:26.880]  male prostitutes. I didn't see that. I saw some weird behavior. I'm not going to go up and show
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:34.880]  old men and bank chairman with their... I saw some things. I saw mainly a strange urination ritual
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:40.640]  where two men walk up, pull their pants partially down, and then start urinating in front of each
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:44.960]  other. I didn't put that in the video. I had a hidden camera. I stayed away from the crowds.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:51.680]  I got in. I hid out in the woods. I went and shot the ritual. So I didn't get a lot of that. I left.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:57.520]  I was in there four hours. Supposedly, the rituals get crazier and crazier in the two weeks. But no,
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.840]  I didn't see any running around naked. I remember Gergen said, when they asked me if
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.440]  you're going this year, he said, no, I didn't want to see a bunch of old men running around naked.
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:11.200]  That's Washington Times. We only cover document information as you do. Again, I'll quit jumping
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:15.360]  in. What is the new world order? What will life be like under it? How do we stop it? What is the
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:23.680]  Illuminati? Well, the Illuminati flows from... There's a connection with Iraq and what's going
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:35.520]  on here as well. The Illuminati formed by Adam Bysop was 1776, basically. There's more to it
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:42.240]  than that. But to make a long story short, they had thousands of members, including Goethe and
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:48.400]  Pestalozzi, who was an influence in the education in America with their own code names, Amoris and
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:55.920]  some other names. John Dewey, his mentor was a G. Stanley Hall, who had gotten his PhD over at
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:03.200]  Leipzig under Wilhelm Funtz, whose grandfather was codenamed Raphael with the Illuminati.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:08.800]  Basically, what they were doing, they would hook themselves up as, let's say,
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:15.040]  tutors of Alexander I in Russia. They were trying to infiltrate. They went into the
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:21.280]  Parisian Outlaws League, fomented through Masonic lodges often, the French Revolution,
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:29.200]  and their attitude was to destroy religion, destroy the heads of government. Basically,
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:34.000]  people thought when the French Revolution said, liberté, égalité, fraternity, it was like the
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:43.760]  US, but by liberté, they really meant license. Egalité meant a leveling of the masses. Fraternité
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:50.480]  really meant a brotherhood that would foster humanistic ideals. Not the way MSNBC admits
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:54.560]  when they talked to 100 Skull and Bones members, this was a few months ago, that they admit that
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:59.840]  in 1832, the German Illuminati came over with the Russell Trust and set up Skull and Bones.
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:08.960]  Please continue. Okay. At that time, you had their slogans of the Russell Trust and Alfonso Taft.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:14.080]  A lot of the people, the early members of Skull and Bones, would have similar mottos.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:20.560]  They decided they were a sort of elite corps coming from a German elite corps. You would find
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:26.640]  swastikas in the tomb, as you call it sometimes. If you said they're Nazis or whatever, they say,
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:31.920]  no, no, this predates that. Yeah, swastikas and the skull. There's World War I, and even before
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:36.880]  that, Russian top generals would wear the skull on their hat, and they were part of the societies.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:45.920]  Go ahead. Yeah. You have these various connections with them that flow on up into
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:52.720]  various segments of this elite mentality using the swastika. Cecil Rhodes' mentor was a John
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:58.160]  Ruskin. He has a swastika on his grave. Roger Kipling is a member of the Rhodes Trust. If you
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:05.120]  look at the cover of his early books, they have swastikas on it. It was used as the key to the
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:11.120]  city of Seattle has a swastika on banks. There was a lot of this. Mavotsky, who was with the
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:17.040]  Theosophical Society, founded that, used the symbol as an elitist mentality. These were the
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:22.480]  elite that were supposed to govern over the masses for our own good. That's the attitude
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:30.720]  that they pretty much bring up to today. They use situations to further their goals in terms of September
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:37.600]  11th. What I try to do is I say, if there is this power elite, what might they do? Prior to
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:43.120]  September 11th, in the book Secret Records of the Olden Globalists, I said the public could be
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:49.680]  conditioned by a terrorist attack so that they would be more willing to give up their freedoms
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:56.640]  in order to have peace and safety. That's what Hart and Rudman and Brzezinski and all of them
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:04.560]  say. That's what Northwoods says. Yeah, in 1962-ish. The very afternoon of September 11th,
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:09.360]  sure enough, ABC Washington Post comes out with a poll saying two-thirds of the public would be
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:13.520]  willing to give up some of our freedoms for peace and security and so forth. As if when you give up
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:20.240]  liberty, you get freedom. Yeah, right. It's the exact opposite of what our founder said. I think
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:25.360]  he was willing to give up his freedom and it's not going to have peace and security anyway.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:34.000]  Moving up to the current situation with Iraq, what I tried to do there was say, okay, if this
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.760]  power elite is in control of things and if there is a war, military conflict in Iraq, what will
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:46.080]  happen? I said there's two possibilities. I said if it's a staged war, it'll be over relatively soon
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:52.560]  with relatively few casualties, even from chemical or biological weapons. That's basically what
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:59.040]  happened. I said because if it had been a real war, what you would have had is Saddam
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:05.040]  torching the oil fields, which he didn't. Destroying the air bases, H2 and H3 in the western part of
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:09.920]  Iraq, he didn't. Destroying the Safwan Highway from Kuwait to Baghdad, he didn't. Not a single
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:14.960]  bridge blown. Then it came out. Before the attack, they admitted that gold bars, goodies were being
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.960]  given to all the Iraqi generals and leaders. Most of them had already agreed to give up,
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:23.040]  signed capitulation orders. Then after the war, they got on MSNBC, I have it on tape, and they
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:29.040]  said a ridiculous conspiracy theory that our government paid them off and secretly flew Saddam
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:33.920]  out. Of course, we'll probably grab some double and try him later, but Saddam was their CIA hitman
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:42.080]  in 1958. That's admitted. Yeah, he was part of a trained six-man assassination team back then,
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:50.960]  which wasn't really the first time. We had in 1953, when the Iranians nationalized their oil field,
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:56.720]  Norman Schwarzkopf, the general's daddy, had just retired from the New Jersey state police.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:03.680]  Allen Dulles, with a secret $10 million CIA slush fund, paid him to train soldiers to overthrow
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.960]  that government of Iran. Yeah, he went to Saudi Arabia and they lived there. That's
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:11.520]  where the little Swartzy grew up. Yeah, so there was a history to that thing.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:18.560]  And the Bin Laden's go back for carrying out Her Majesty's activities. The Bin Laden families had
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:23.520]  tried and trusted the little Klan too, aren't they? They were also CIA assets, just like,
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.920]  in fact, the Bush, Daddy Bush, used to stay with the Bin Laden's when he would visit over there.
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:33.600]  Still, through Carlisle and some other aspects. Well, now Bechel's involved in it.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:40.240]  Yeah, that's George Shultz. Had been president, I think, of Bechel just prior to the... He was
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.600]  Secretary of State under Reagan. George Shultz, according to major press reports,
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:47.040]  likes to take part in the rituals of Bohemian Grove. That's part of being a Christian.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:52.560]  That's right. And he's one of the Vulcans, as they call them, that trained George W. Bush to
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:57.120]  become president. Now, they have all these weird names. They call them Prince of Darkness, Vulcan.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:03.280]  What are the different little code levels they have? Oh, they come up with all sorts of
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:08.720]  nicknames for them. Some are called Death Leaders. These are loving Christians.
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:16.000]  If you say so. But a lot of people would say, who scoff at what you say about New World Order or
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.320]  whatever, they're reliant upon the press. And so whenever they say, well, gee, Dan Radler would
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:28.560]  have told me something about this, I say, look, this is very simple. It's been 18 months since
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:36.480]  September 11th, right? Oh yeah, 18 months. And I say, look, has Dan Radler bothered at any time
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:46.640]  to tell you on the nightly news why on September 10th of 2001 some top Pentagon officials suddenly
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:51.680]  picked up the phone and canceled their flight plans for the next morning because of security
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:56.560]  concerns? Has anybody asked why the FAA told Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco not to fly to New
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:01.040]  York that day? Or why Salman Rushdie in the Times of London called and asked the FAA, they admitted
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:05.280]  he was banned, quote, for his safety from flying that month. No one's asked why Bush was on Cipro,
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:09.840]  the anthrax-fighting antibiotic, September 10th with his cabinet, four weeks before it showed up
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:13.840]  bunker baton. No one's asked why three of the so-called hijackers were trained at Pensacola
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:18.960]  Naval Air Station, the defense language, why the head of Pakistan intelligence wired $100,000 to
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:24.240]  ATA, and why the head of Pakistan intelligence was there at the White House in Capitol Hill the week
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:28.560]  before 9-1-1. No one's asked any of these questions, have they? No one's asked why the
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:33.280]  AP reported that the CIA was doing a drill that morning of flying jets into buildings in New York
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:40.880]  and DC, quote, their cover for why NORAD stood down. Yeah, and that the same outfit had a similar
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:47.280]  drill the year before, and nobody picked up on that either. Well, they had the drill that morning
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:53.280]  at that very time. Just the drill, of course. Right. That way if you get compartmentalization
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:57.040]  breaking down and spilling over, other people at the Pentagon or CIA going, hey, what's going on?
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:05.680]  Oh, just a drill. Yeah, that's right. They have all types of capabilities that we don't know about.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:12.880]  If you told people, let's say, that they were altering your brain waves, they'd look at you
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:18.000]  like you were some kind of idiot. So that's why, for example, in The Globalist, I actually put the
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.720]  patent number since 1976 where they've been abled remotely. They don't even have to put
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:27.600]  the electrodes in your head. Remotely alter your brain waves. Well, wait. I had the CEO on last
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:34.000]  year. The Coke machines are about to come out with a beam that transmits where only you can hear it.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:38.560]  Hey, have a nice cold Coke, and soon, off-past you, it'll say your name to you.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:44.880]  Yeah. So what you have to do is manipulate the public, and that's why I think we had a
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:51.040]  close election. People say, oh, my goodness. We can't criticize George W. Bush because if we do,
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:55.840]  then those nasty old liberal Democrats will be back in control. But George Bush and
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:00.080]  Chucky Schumer vote to federalize the elections and put in the touch screens out of the crisis.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:07.600]  And it wasn't Bill Clinton who had federal agents go into Pastor Dixon's Indiana church
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:11.360]  and drag him and some members of his congregation out either, was it?
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:17.760]  No, it wasn't. It was the Skull and Bones pastor that launched that attack.
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:22.800]  Well, hey, isn't Anton LaVey a good Christian man than Dr. Cuddy?
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.720]  Well, I mean, you know, you wear black outfits, you worship Satan. Isn't that a Christian thing
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:35.840]  to do? No, neither is Alistair Crowley, but- But wait, then. Why do all these neocon Christian
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:40.720]  leaders say, submit to world government now, microchips aren't that bad, forced abortion's
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:45.520]  really okay over in China? Isn't that old Christian now? Isn't it us that has a problem?
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:52.560]  No, no, it's really not. Why suddenly do we see all the big Christian leaders telling us to submit
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:58.800]  to all this? Did you say why are they? Yeah, suddenly they're all telling us how good it is.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:05.200]  Yeah, because of what I just said, the election was close. As long as you have the alternation
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:10.560]  of power that Quigley said the Skull and Bones plan had back under the Whitney's, that you have
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:15.840]  a Skull and Bones Bush replaced by a Rhodes Scholar Clinton replaced by a Skull and Bones
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:20.640]  George W. Bush. Now, what about this election? We've got a Skull and Bones Kerry as the leader
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:24.960]  for the Democrats against a Skull and Bones Bush. Yeah, well, that would guarantee the eight years,
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:29.600]  just like Clinton had eight years. So if that were to occur, I don't think it will. I don't
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:35.280]  think Kerry's going to make it. But if it were to occur, then that would... See, one thing they do,
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:41.680]  that people looking for a conspiracy say, okay, what is their plan? Actually, their plan has
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:47.920]  several variations and alternatives so they can make adjustments. That's why they really didn't
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:52.960]  have to call up 19 people and tell them to fly into the World Trade Center. What they did years
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:58.560]  ago was set up a mechanism whereby... Set up the CIA, find the young ignorant Arabs,
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:02.400]  get them involved, have them seen at the scene over and over again. Say what? Stay there,
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:07.760]  Dr. Cuddy. And can you hold with us into the next hour? Well, Violet said a half hour to an hour,
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:25.440]  so I guess I better do it, yes. Dr. Cuddy has agreed to stay with us another 25 minutes,
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:29.600]  20 minutes into the next hour. That way we'll have time to take your calls. And we've got folks
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.840]  already holding, wanting to talk to him like Wayne and others. The total free number to join
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:44.320]  us, and this guy really is an expert on the New World Order, 1-800-259-9231, 800-2599231.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:49.680]  And everything he covers in his books is from public record documents, the Globalist own
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:54.080]  statements. Just like Gary Hart in my film, Road to Tyranny, saying we're going to use this disaster,
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:35:00.960]  9-1-1, for the New World Order. The project for New American Century that Dr. Cuddy mentioned
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:08.400]  is Jeb Bush and Rumsfeld and then Bush and then Wolfowitz and Pearl saying we need a Pearl Harbor
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:12.720]  catastrophic event to get our New World Order. We need to be attacked so we can take over.
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:18.560]  Saddam isn't a threat. We want the oil. We want a military base to attack everybody. World War III,
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:25.440]  100-year war, take everybody's rights. It's all public. And I've made a new film, my friends,
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:33.440]  Police State 3, Total Enslavement. And my videos just get better as they go along. This new one is
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:41.200]  amazing. Two hours and 37 minutes long, totally jam-packed. You want to know a giant overview of
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:46.240]  what they're doing to you and what they plan to do to you, get the video. In fact, you can get the
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:53.680]  three Police State videos for $60. The films are $25.95 apiece, $20 if you order three or more
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:36:00.960]  apiece. My book is only $12, 9-1-1, Descent into Tyranny. I have my other 9-1-1 films as well.

[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:34.960]  free number to order 1-888-253-3139. That's 888-253-3139 or Infowars.com or net. Or just
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:44.720]  write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704. Take action.
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:51.200]  Expose the terrorists. Expose the true evildoers. Dr. Cuddy Bush gives a lot of speeches. He gave
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:56.320]  one at the Pentagon talking about a dark cult of evil. No one knows the power of evil. The men that
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:01.360]  did the hijackings were instruments of this dark cult of evil. There's a lot of double meanings
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:05.040]  with these people. You get into that in your books. What are the books you recommend to the
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:12.160]  listeners of this show and how do they get them? Well, there's a number of books. I guess the
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:16.480]  main ones would be the current one that's just coming out. It's called Cover Up, Government
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:23.040]  Spinner Truth. It deals with the September 11th issue and Iraq. As I said, I made some predictions
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:29.360]  as well as our vanishing constitutional rights. The one just before that was titled September 11th,
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:34.720]  Prior Knowledge, where I do some investigation and basically conclude that we have the information
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:40.000]  to know what would happen in advance. The one prior to that came out just prior to September
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.880]  11th. That's called The Globalists, The Power Elite Exposed. I try and put some actual letters-
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:49.760]  You got the textbooks for the kids, the people going to college to be social workers saying,
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:56.080]  we'll destroy the family. We must do it now. Yeah. Yeah. That's a plan from a long time ago.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:04.880]  They're on textbooks. How do folks get them? Call toll free 888-891-3300.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:13.760]  888-891-3300, 888-891-3300. Some of your books are in bookstores, correct?
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:19.280]  They can be. They're in a lot of Christian bookstores. Yes, that's true.
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:23.920]  Those that don't believe Skilling Bones is Christian. There's a new type of Christianity
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:28.160]  where, you know, Anton LaVey's a good guy, but we're not that type here. Sorry folks.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:33.200]  Well, that's part of the plan too. John Dewey had what he called a common faith where he said
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:37.520]  dogmatic religions, dogmatic Christianity would have to surrender to this humanism.
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:42.320]  And that's what they called for after 9-1-1, coffee and we need a world religion. All right,
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:46.480]  your calls for Dr. Dennis Chutty. I'm Alex Jones. Third Hour coming up. We'll be with
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:52.480]  us for about 20 minutes. We'll talk to Wayne and others. 1-800-259-9231. And remember,
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:55.200]  my new film, Police State 3, is now out.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:09.440]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:18.400]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:26.560]  All right, my friends. Already into the third and final hour of this Wednesday live edition.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:31.600]  We do this show Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. central time and back from 9 to
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:37.120]  midnight central time with a rebroadcast of the daytime show from 1 a.m. to 4 a.m. The websites
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:42.320]  are in fullwars.com and net. Talking to Dennis Lawrence Cuddy. Dennis Cuddy, historian, political
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:47.360]  analyst, PhD, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, major in American history,
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:51.280]  modern political science. Dr. Cuddy has taught at the university level and has been a political
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:56.480]  and economic risk analysis analyst for the international consulting firm and has been a
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:00.240]  senior associate with the U.S. Department of Education. He has also testified before members
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:04.960]  of the Congress on behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice. Dr. Cuddy has authored or edited 17
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:09.600]  books and booklets and has written hundreds of articles appearing in newspapers around the nation.
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:14.560]  Dr. Cuddy, we routinely link to articles you've written. I know newswithviews.com carries some of
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:18.640]  your stuff. Where can people read some of your other insightful, lengthy articles?
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:26.000]  Well, I have a book that's called American Commentary. It's that same toll-free number
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:34.240]  that has a collection of them. There are others, an article or two on the World Net Daily website.
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:41.600]  I've got a link here on infowars.com to your expanded addendum to cover up government spin
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:46.800]  or truth, a 23-page analysis you did, I guess a segment from your new book.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:52.480]  What happened was, of course, as you know with your books, you write them in advance.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:57.440]  A lot has happened in the last month. There's a small addendum in the book cover-up,
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:03.520]  but so much has happened that I put an expanded addendum that you just referred to on newswithviews.com
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:09.840]  where I go through basically what's happened and conclude with, as you said about the Illuminati,
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:14.960]  Voltaire, who was behind the French Revolution, was hooked up with these people.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:22.480]  If you look at the Statue of Liberty, it came from the French Freemasons, really the liberté,
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.840]  don't impose morality, do your own thing, rather than...
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:26.640]  Who is thou will?
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:34.000]  Yeah. What you find is that there are seven rays on her head. The picture from ancient times of
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:41.200]  Semiramis, the goddess who founded Babylon, Iraq, is exactly like that with the seven rays.
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:46.240]  Voltaire wrote a play called Semiramis, so there's this connection there.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:53.280]  Absolutely. Let's go to the calls. Let's talk to Wayne in Virginia. You're on the air with
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:57.360]  Dr. Dennis Cuddy. Thanks for holding. Yes, sir. Dr. Cuddy, good to hear you today.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:04.800]  You were starting out a little earlier with a development discussion on Mr. Crystal. I don't
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:08.000]  know if you quite got to it. I'd like to hear the rest of what you were going to tell us about Mr.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.080]  Crystal. Ultra coming.
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:17.760]  I also wanted to ask how you respond to those who say that due to the animosity between the
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:22.480]  closed or false animosity between the United States and Europe and Germany that the New
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:23.760]  World Order is dead.
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:28.960]  Well, we talked about that, how it's a synthesis. We're playing the part of the bad cop. The U.N.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:33.520]  plays the part of the good cop to keep everybody in the control, giving them two different versions
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:37.440]  of the New World Order is what their policy reports have said to bypass any discussion of
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:39.280]  not having a New World Order. Go ahead, Dr. Cuddy.
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:42.880]  Does he have any documentation about anticipating that? I mean, his book.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:46.400]  The globalists have said that in their own policy reports. I can dig them out. Go ahead, Dr. Cuddy.
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:53.440]  Yeah, like I said, I try to include that in the cover-up, the current book on September 11th and
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:59.360]  the other things. In terms of William Crystal, very quickly, where I was was William Bennett
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:04.480]  became head of the Department of Education where I was. He brought William Crystal as his chief of
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:09.120]  staff. From there, he became chief of staff. Crystal did to Dan Quayle. And from there,
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:15.200]  he got his current position. And my point is I think this was like a 25-, 30-year plan of Irving
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:19.840]  Crystal, his daddy, who Alex mentioned. Who was the socialist?
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:23.360]  Well, they would say Trotskyites from years ago.
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:31.040]  Oh, the neocon's a Trotskyite, but he wants police in black uniforms and all your liberties gone and
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:34.480]  a global government. Oh, they're so conservative. And Bush wants your guns.
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:42.720]  Anything else you want to add, Wayne? So, making Crystal chief of staff when
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.800]  Bush senior advisor... Stay there. I'll let you finish up on the other side,
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:52.320]  Wayne. And then we'll go to Randy and plenty others. 1-800-259-9231.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:55.920]  Your calls for Dr. Dennis Cuddy. Coming up, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:02.240]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:07.920]  Controlling the left and right, controlling the outcome, controlling the debate. And I'm glad that
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:12.320]  Dennis Cuddy has this great understanding of the phony left-right system and how the
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:16.800]  UN's playing a part of the good cop of the third world as America's used as the muscle for the
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:21.920]  New World Order to take over the last few sovereign nations. And we're not debating whether it's good
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:26.160]  people that run these nations or not. The point is the big master plan is to totally dumb us down
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:30.800]  and dominate us. And before Dr. Cuddy leaves us, I want to ask him what life will be like under the
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:35.840]  New World Order's dreams if they're able to get everything they want. But right now,
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:39.520]  let's go back to Wayne in Virginia. Wayne, one more question for Dr. Cuddy. Go ahead.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:45.440]  Yes, sir. I just wanted to know how on earth they were successful in getting
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:51.520]  this gentleman, Mr. Crystal, to be chief of staff of the bone that had been thrown to the
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.960]  conservative Christians at the time of Mr. Quayle's appointment as vice president.
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:57.200]  Was Bush running the whole thing?
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:01.440]  I mean, here's the question. How do we have the neocons, most of them,
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:06.240]  right out of the loins of Trotskyites calling for big government? How do they do this? And
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:10.800]  the answer is the media set up and played ball with the phony left-right system and never told
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:16.720]  you that. Go ahead, Dr. Cuddy. Yeah. And that specifically, like I said, was part of a staged
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:21.920]  process. He could not have gotten that position unless he had been chief of staff to Bill Bennett.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:28.160]  And that's why Irving Crystal, Bill Crystal's dad, was promoting Bill Bennett early on many,
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:35.040]  many years before. All right, gentlemen. All right. Appreciate the call. Yeah. When you see
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:44.320]  all these neocons, Michael Savage admitted beatnik, admitted dirty commie, up there saying
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:49.760]  line up Americans, put them in prisons if they criticize the government. I mean, they're on the
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:56.080]  air saying this. They're all in the same bag. And he's admitted beatnik. It's funny, isn't it, Dr.
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:59.600]  Cuddy, to see beatniks telling us that they're conservative. That's interesting, isn't it?
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:06.240]  Yeah. And there's a third group. We had mentioned the Project for the New American Century and the
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:10.480]  Crystals and then Gary Hart with the U.S. Commission on National Security. A third group
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:19.040]  since you're in Texas is a year before September 11th, the James Baker, former Secretary of State
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:27.040]  Institute, in joint operation with the CFR itself, funded a study heavily with oil people saying we
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:31.600]  need to secure the oil from the Caspian Sea area. That would be, you know, we were going to pump it
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:36.880]  down through Afghanistan. That Saddam was a threat to the Gulf oil. We needed to make economic and
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:42.160]  military assessments of what we could do. And if we somehow got a deal for the Iraq reserves,
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:45.920]  that would be a major asset. And this is so they can just act smart and get it out to their
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:49.760]  low-level intellectuals. They've been getting ready for Gulf too since the end of the last one.
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:56.240]  Yeah. In fact, in the first one, there was Bush. The first President Bush's primary concern was
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:01.840]  that we would not have a war, that Saddam would withdraw his forces. Colin Powell and Baker were
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:07.600]  going to go over negotiations. And at that moment, Bush Senior and Brent Scowcroft looked at each
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:13.600]  other and said, no, we have to have this war. And so my inclination is that George W. Bush
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:18.960]  had to have this war. And now they're already, have you seen the incredible insane statements of
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:23.360]  we're going to go ahead and invade more countries? Yeah, others are next. And they're threatening
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:28.560]  psychopaths with nukes saying, and then Rumsfeld's little document gets released saying they're going
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:34.160]  to start bombing North Korea this October. I mean, is that not like trying to push the Japanese to
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:41.600]  launch a Pearl Harbor? The North Koreans, yeah. Kim Il Jung and then, yeah, the threat to that
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:47.920]  region is clear. But you have to remember what you said earlier about dumbing the people down.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:53.760]  For example, Bush, when he had 9-11 and he was going to have an investigation, he appoints Henry
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:48:00.640]  Kissinger, all right? If the public would have even the slightest knowledge about Henry Kissinger,
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:05.680]  they would say, why are you putting in charge of this investigation a man who is called our soldier
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:10.880]  as, quote, dumb animal to be used in the furtherance of our foreign policy? And the guy
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:16.400]  publicly says this and we call him a conservative because the neocons won't tell us. And on top of
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:20.320]  it, now the guy they're going to have run on Iraq turns out worked for Kissinger Associates.
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:25.040]  Kissinger's involved in all of this. That's like having Joseph Mingala investigate Hitler.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:32.480]  Yeah, and Kissinger's also hooked up with McClarty, Matt McClarty now. So it's McClarty,
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:37.680]  Kissinger, and Associates there. They're branching out. How did Pearl get the nickname Prince of
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:44.800]  Darkness? Oh, I think that was an appellation given to him by his detractors. He looks sort of
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:51.120]  very stirred and always serious. And I think there have been plays that have involved, quote,
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:55.440]  the Prince of Darkness and he has some look like that. Well, yeah, he glows kind of that,
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:00.800]  you know, people that really have that glow in the dark look. But we don't care about what he
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:05.920]  looks like. It's what he says. Randy in Georgia, you're on the air. Go ahead, Randy. Yeah, thanks,
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:14.080]  Alex. I've been listening to you for months and, you know, it's not something that you want to
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:24.400]  believe. But the more you guys go on, the more I begin to believe it because I watch the events
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:31.200]  that are predicted and the way things are going. Well, I mean, when Knight Ritter newspaper says
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:36.400]  neocons want New World Order, Bush wants your guns. I mean, supercomputers in China, open
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:42.640]  borders, campaign finance reform. I mean, this guy is Bill Clinton on steroids. Antichrist is
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:48.880]  what it seems like. Well, no, sir. Skull and Bones is a Christian organization. Please don't attack
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:56.080]  this Christian president again. Oh, well, we wouldn't want to do that. Ask your preacher if
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:50:01.120]  you can come to the Baptist Church, if you start wearing an Anton LaVey suit and then when he has a
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:05.200]  problem with it, say, wait a minute, this is this is what the president wears. And I'm sorry, go
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:10.240]  ahead. I'm not kidding about that, by the way. They caught video of it. They dressed up in satanic
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:17.600]  outfits. I'm sorry. Go ahead. I don't know what where you got the term neocons, but I think it's
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:23.680]  more appropriate that you call them pseudo cons. Well, that's really what they are. Dr. Cutty,
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:29.520]  you want to tell them where neocon comes from? Yeah. Many years ago, you had your basically
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:34.400]  traditional conservatives throughout the first part of the 20th century. And then there were
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:40.240]  these leftist Trotskyite types, socialists. As I said, Mitch Dexter, who's part of this,
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:44.240]  was the vice president of what had been called the Intercollegiate Socialist Society. They're
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:50.480]  men and infiltrators. And they basically started to have a problem with the direction they saw the
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:56.640]  Soviet Union going and persecution against Jews and other people and so on. And so in terms of
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:02.560]  foreign policy, they had a shift to conservative. Now, on domestic agenda, sometimes they're not.
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:06.800]  But in foreign policy, they had a shift. And so they came to this type of, quote,
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:12.320]  conservatism late. Not that we're supposed to believe. But yeah, that's right. They're really
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:17.280]  not, quote, conservative in the traditional sense of it. And they have come to dominate it so much
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:23.120]  that even Ted Koppel on Nightline had a program talking about the PNAC project, the New American
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:27.920]  Century. And he had a Professor Lustig on there from Pennsylvania. And he said these guys,
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:36.960]  quote, control the White House now. Okay. I can get that. My question is this. Okay.
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:47.840]  The average Joe doesn't have a lot of time to devote to really winnowing the truth.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:52.400]  Yeah, but I bet that average Joe knows all the baseball scores.
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:57.040]  I bet he's got plenty of time in to go to the fancy restaurant and eat T-bones.
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:00.480]  Well, you're right. I mean, it's- Well, he's going to have to make time. He's
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:03.920]  not going to have a job. His kids are going to be in prison. He's not going to have a life.
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:09.520]  Right. You have to make a concerted effort. And there comes to a point where you tumble to that.
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:15.360]  My suggestion is this, or I'm asking for information. You may know something.
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:24.000]  What is the best place to find PDF documents that are easily downloadable?
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.640]  Well, are you saying the average Joe isn't going to read a PDF document? That's prisonplanet.com,
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:34.480]  infowars.com. My videos are tailor-made for the general public. People aren't stupid. They're
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:38.960]  just not into reading giant dossiers and stuff. I mean, Cuddy's books are good. They're very
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:43.600]  readable and very frightening. It's like reading a nightmare novel, but it's real.
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:47.520]  I've given some of his books, but I have to tell you, my videos are waking up 90%
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:53.920]  of those that see them. Thanks for the call, Randy. Dr. Cuddy, not a selfless plug,
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:56.640]  but I didn't know you'd seen some of my videos. What videos have you seen?
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:01.920]  The police state, I think two, and the 9-11 one.
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:03.040]  What did you think of the videos?
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:12.080]  Pretty good. I liked basically the live shots, for example, where the federal agent there is
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:18.480]  in Kansas or wherever he is and telling the seminar that our founders could be considered
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:21.680]  terrorists, stuff like that. And the training manuals that Christians
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:24.240]  are terrorists, homeschoolers. Yeah, that's kind of a wake-up call.
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:26.000]  Yeah, from the Phoenix office.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.480]  I mean, if they would have put that in the movie Red Dawn, we'd have gone,
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:32.960]  those darn commies. But here in America, it's, oh, wow, they're friendly.
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:37.200]  Let's talk to John in Florida. John, you're on the air with Dr. Cuddy.
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:41.440]  Yes. Good afternoon. Good to hear you, Alex. Thank you very much for the interview with Dr.
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:47.040]  Cuddy today. It's excellent. Dr. Cuddy, you were at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:52.320]  No, I was, and then I went to the U.S. Department of Education in Washington,
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:53.840]  and now I'm back writing.
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:56.560]  Incidentally, was that your wake-up call being inside there?
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:59.360]  Who, me? Yes, sir.
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:04.800]  No, I had been, I think, unbeknownst to me, I was being groomed to be one of these people in the
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:10.560]  early 60s. I went to a Carnegie-funded first governor's school in the nation, and they asked
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:15.920]  us some strange questions. And so I got the private papers between the tester and the psychological
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:18.960]  corporation in New York, where they wanted to keep tabs on us.
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:21.680]  For those that don't know, that's how the Illuminati did it with the Masons,
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:24.400]  is they give you questionnaires, you know, will you do this, will you do that?
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:28.160]  Hey, Doctor? Yes, sir.
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:33.680]  How's your family name spelled, please? C-U-D-D-Y.
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:40.000]  Uh-huh. Okay. I have an anecdotal comment and a question. Back in 1960, I purchased the used
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:45.280]  bookstore, two publications by Adolf Hitler. First was Mein Kampf that I read. The second
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:52.000]  was a book of all of his written and spoken speeches called The New Order,
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.240]  which is a book that most people are unaware of.
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:57.920]  I got Hitler on tape saying we will build a new world order.
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:02.480]  These are hardcover books printed by a prestigious New York City publishing firm.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:04.320]  Well, let's get a comment from Dr. Cutty on that.
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:12.320]  Uh-huh. Well, my question also is, are you aware of the NATO symbol, the swastikas that are
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:18.560]  concealed, very well camouflaged within the NATO four-pointed star in the interrupted circles?
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:27.360]  No, but I know there are little swastikas on the primary temple of the Scottish Rite in Washington
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:32.800]  and the National Security Agency symbol also is bothersome. I hear the music, though.
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:37.840]  Yeah, folks, they're my cultists. It's a sun god symbol. Dr. Cutty, do five more minutes with us
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:41.200]  because I want to come back and plug your books again and I want to take a call from Tom in
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:46.000]  California and that'll be it for calls for our guests. One more quick segment with our guests,
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.360]  a little five-minute segment, and then I'm going to get into some of the news.
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:51.760]  I haven't covered yet the incredible corruption,
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:54.800]  a bunch of world events, and some gun grabbing by the neo-cons.
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:03.920]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:09.680]  All right, our final segment with Dr. Dennis Cutty. I'll be back
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:14.720]  with the last half of this hour getting into the news we haven't gotten to yet. Believe me,
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:19.120]  it's very important, so stay with us. The new world order is a real thing. The devil's biggest
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:22.960]  trick was convincing the world he didn't exist. They've done that. Now it's in your face. All
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:27.040]  these years we warned you. Now it's in your face. Your police are dressed up like Nazis.
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:32.320]  The control grid is being put in place. The new economy will be prisons and total domination.
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:35.200]  I want to take a few calls from Tom and Mike before we wrap up this interview,
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:39.680]  Dr. Cutty, but what will life be like under the new world order if they get their way?
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:45.760]  Well, eventually, of course, biblically you have an antichrist, but before then,
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:51.440]  as you said, if you play the good cop, bad cop, what they hoped to do is what Orwell said. They
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:56.640]  would quicken the tempo of human life, which they did. They wanted to keep the masses busy and
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:57:01.600]  entertained so that you would actually, as he said, come to love big brother. You would go along
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:05.920]  with the president if they wanted to get us into a war. You wouldn't ask too many questions and so
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:14.080]  forth. The introduction, though, you have German troops here. We settled 8,000 Iraqi soldiers here
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:18.720]  after the first Gulf War. Now they've signed deals to bring in Canadian, Mexican, Dutch.
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:25.040]  Right. The southern border is still a sieve. You've got terrorists coming across there.
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:31.040]  But basically what you would have to do is have an external policing mechanism. So
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:36.160]  in 1952, there was a map drawn of when the new world order, world government finally came about,
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:42.240]  what nations would be policing other nations. According to that 1952 map, it said American
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:46.400]  forces would be in Yugoslavia where they are now, in Kazakhstan where they are now,
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:52.320]  in Australia where they are now, and so forth. Foreign troops, Mongolian, Chinese troops would
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:55.920]  be in the lower part of California where, you know, Costco and-
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:59.520]  Right here in Texas, Czechoslovakia, and just so happens that's who's here.
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:04.960]  The Russian troops would be from Fort Polk, Louisiana, up to Fort Riley, Kansas where they-
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:09.360]  And I've got a copy of that publicly in the newspaper, and now today it's happening
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:13.440]  50 years later. Let's take these calls. We're just out of time here. Great information. He's
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:17.280]  right on target, folks. I guess that's the birthright of your children. Now will be to
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:22.480]  work for the Russians. We have, oh, the new KGB chief to come save us. Tom in California,
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:26.960]  you're on the air. Go ahead. Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. I was going to stray away from the
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:30.560]  subject a little. I just had a question, since I have two experts on the line. Have either of
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:34.960]  you heard of the National Economic Security and Reformation Act? And if so-
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:40.480]  Disinformation operation, Dr. Cuddy? I thought so. Well, I'll defer to you on that. Go on.
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:43.760]  Okay. Anything else? No. That's all I had.
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:49.360]  Yeah. Oh, the government's really good and secretly gave us all our rights back, Dr. Cuddy.
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:56.000]  Thank you. So you agree with that? It's ridiculous. Mike in Arizona,
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.280]  you're on the air. Go ahead. Yes. Good morning, gentlemen.
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:07.440]  To what extent, Dr. Cuddy, are the Fortune 500 companies, to what extent have they thrown their
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:11.440]  lots in with this new world order agenda? Well, you can't be their chairman or CEO
[00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:17.440]  unless you're with them. Go ahead, Dr. Cuddy. Yeah. They've had to for 30 years. They've been
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:22.720]  getting a lot or most of their profits from overseas. And it's the old Stalinist disunion
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:27.840]  for the purpose of union. You have to break down national loyalties. And then according to Cecil
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:32.240]  Rhodes and Zbigniew Brzezinski recently, where he said, we'll have world government, but we have to
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:40.640]  have a regional approach. What you do is you'd have NAFTA linked up with the Asian Consortium
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:45.360]  of Economics. And then you would say, well, now we have a world economy. We have to have it managed
[00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:48.640]  by our world government. Yeah. Now we're so dependent on Mexico and Canada, Pan American
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:52.560]  Union. Right. Now there's so many people across borders got to merge the social security system.
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:57.440]  I want to give you a local example. If they can de-industrialize the snow factories,
[00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:01.760]  people are going to accept being prison guards as their job. They're going to accept being
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:07.440]  tattletale squads. They're going to accept this. They say America is going to be a police state
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:12.160]  enslavement grid that produces propaganda for the world. They said that's what America will be.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.840]  The armpit of Satan literally...
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:32.160]  Am I on? Okay. Basically what you have is a push for that through economics so that under NAFTA
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:37.600]  you have a lot of factories on the other side of the Mexican border really making Mexico a 51st
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:42.480]  state without rules and regulations and opening up that border towards a flood and, as they call
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:48.400]  it, Reconquista of the Southwest. And so that way you break down the nation of the United States
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:53.200]  and economics and your job and you're willing to have lower wages becomes more important to
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:01:06.080]  you than the old fashioned patriotism. Thank you for joining us. Thanks for joining us,
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:11.760]  Dr. Cutty. We'll be right back folks. Thank you. Stay with us.
